# NSA Grabs Chance For 2nd Review
## Excom May Study Affiliation Issue Tomorrow Night 
### 
Stanford's NSA Committee naught
h straw in the wind last night in an
attempt to reopen consideration of
the group as a campus organization |
next year.
Excom voted April 12 to disaflil- j
iate with the National Student As- j
sociation. Last night, in their pre- |
liminary session to the regular I
Wednesday meeting, ten student j
representatives were divided evenly !
on whether to reconsider NSA.
As a result of the straw vote, a i
motion probably will he made to- j
morrow night to reopen NSA con- j
sideration, particularly to hear Dick j
Keiton, regional NSA president, j
present a report on the value of na
tional affiliatoin to Stanford.
Reduced Budget
The vote came after Jan Robert
son said that the local NSA Com- ,
mittee was prepared to submit a j
reduced budget of $385 if Excom |
would reinstate it. NSA originally J
sought $1,100 to carry on operations
for the new year. Excom voted for j
disaffiliation on the grounds that
the benefits of national association
did not warrant the expense.
Miss Robertson said that lower
dues were in sight and that NSA, if
reinstated, was prepared to trim ex
penses to the annual conference to !
$50, thus making the reduced budg- j
et possible.
The dissenting Excom members j
said that the issue had been closed !
and should remain so. They pre- i
dieted another long, drawn-out dis— |
cussion if the NSA hearing is re- j
opened.
Social Board
Excom members also reviewed a |
by - law addition which would j
.strengthen the hand of the ASSU ;
vice-president as student body so- j
cial chairman. The amendment sets [
up an activities reviewing board |
with Ihe vice-president as chair- i
man.
Other members would be the |
presidents of I lie four classes, Car- I
dinals, and AWS. Rally Committee
would sit with the board during the i
fall quarter.
The by-law will be presented for
vote tomorrow night.
The board would have recoin- j
mending power in studying and set
ting up the year's social program.
