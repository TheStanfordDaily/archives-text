# Election Board ,Slates Rally Today; Campaign Violation Draws Penalty
## Sentenced To 5 Hours 
### 
A student caught tearing
j down campaign posters at the
Village Sunday night was given
five hours' work at the Conva
lescent Home by the Election
Judgment Board last night. His
sentence was for violation of
| election regulations.
ClifT Carlsen, Election Board chair
men, stressed the fact that this stu
| dent is not the only one who has
; defaced posters, although lie is the
j first one who has been caught. The
: guilty student was not a candidate,
I and was nol connected with any
j candidate, Carlsen said.
The penalty is only tentative as
i 'he student was out of town and did
; not. appear before the board. When
I ho returns, he may appeal to the
J Council for Student Control.
Gregg Bemi.%, a member of the
, judgment panel, hoped that the cam
| pus would take note of the penalty.
| "In this election, campaign procedure
1 is coing to be strictly enforced," he
I said.
Members of the Election Judgment
Board are Carlsen, Dick Thacker, a
member of Men's Council; and Bern is,
who is Excom member from Men's
Halls.
Only students who are now gradu
ates may vote for Graduate Excom,
Carlsen said, to clear up a hazy point.
Jack Hunter, ballots chairman,
asked all students to vote for three
1 candidates for each office. Under the
j preferential system, if your candi
! date is eliminated first, your ballot
no longer counts if you have not
j marked your second and third
' choices, he said.
Voting booths will be open tomor
i row from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Cel
j lar, Engineering Corner, the Post
Office, the Main Library, History
