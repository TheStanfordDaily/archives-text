WASHINGTON â€” President Tru
man solemnly warned tonight there
is real danger that Communism will
swallow up more free nations and
strengthen Russia for an ultimate
attack on the United States.
Mr. Truman, in the course of a
vigorous reply to Senator McCarthy
(R., Wis.) and other critics of the
administration's program for weed
ing Communists out of government,
said Communists at home are sim
ply a "noisy hut small and univer
sally despised group."
"The greatest threat comes form
Communist imperialism abroad,
where the center of its military and
economic strength lies. The real
danger is that Communism might
overrun other free nations and thus
strengthen itself for an ultimate at
tack against us," he declared.
