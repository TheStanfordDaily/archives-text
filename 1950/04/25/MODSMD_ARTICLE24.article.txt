### JOHN BODNAR 
1 had been waiting for Suzie .some JO minutes in
Branner lobLy, thumbing through magazines J had
seen some hundred times before, if hot in women's
residences then in barber shops. Receptionists and
housemothers hold a vague terror for me. They de
velop a look that seems to suggest, young man, you
look like a rowdy to me, and I'll have you know that
our girls are well-bred ladies. Better behave.
Ten more minutes went by. 1 rose and started pacing
the floor. As I passed by the mirror, I would stop arid
gaze at myself, but even that got old. 'two middle
aged women and a child entered and sat down. The
little girl looked over at me, causing me to fortify
myself behind a magazine. Women of any aye unnerve
me.
After a few minutes, I cautiously peered over the
edge and there was the child's face starting al me. She
stood directly in front of me. She must have been at
that stage where all adults are parent:, to her, for she
said:
"Whose daddy are you?"
1 slumped down in my scat. One of the women came
over and took the child by the arm. "Don't bother
that boy, dear," she svid. Boy? Boy? I repeated to
myself. Oh, the stories I could unravel, I thought as I
pulled myself to a proud sitting Boy, indeed!
Thirty minutes of my youth had swept away, gone
into the process of flipping the pages of "Life" maga
zine, and still no Suzie. This had happened before,
and clearly something must be done. Being limited
in that fertile gray matter, J called Jirn and posed the
problem to him He reassured me and then (old me
his plan.
1 went back to the lobby, smiling a devilish smile.

Some in minutes later, Suzie came skipping in looking
like a cross between a canary and a great blue heron.
"Sorry to be late, but you'll forgive me, won't you,
dear boy?" she said. That word, "boy," again. She
smiled at me, but I only assumed a rigid position and
stared at the drapes, saying nothing in return.
"Are you all right?" She looked curiously al me. 1
knew ii was working. "You're angry because I'm a
teeny-weeny bitsy k.te, aren't you?" I continued to
stare at the drape. "You're being awfully silly. Be
sides, it's good tor your character." I remained im
mobile, like a yogi. "You've had your little joke—"
Just then Jim strode into the room, carrying a black
doctor's bag and bringing two pledges as attendants
carrying a stretcher with them. He stopped in front
of me, shook his head and sighed. "Another case," he
said. He jabbed lightly at my nose, a gesture I didn't
appreciate.
"What's wrong?" asked Suzie.
"I'm afraid the worst has come," he said in his best
Paul Muni manner. "This poor unfortunate has recep
tion-room exhaustion."
"Golly, what's that?"
"You've heard of heat exhaustion. Well this is simi
lar, only the patient loses his senses looking at drapes
and paintings and wallpaper. We'll have to take him
away." 1 didn't see how the last statement fit into the
original plan.
"We had a date, but now I'll have to stay in and
study that horrible Western Civ." A tear came into
her eye. This girl was smarter than I had given he)'
credit for.
Jim motioned to the attendants to carry me away.
The last thing J heard as I was being gagged and tied
was Jim saying, "Maybe I could substitute? Hinmm?"

doctor's bag and bringing two pledges as attendants
carrying a stretcher with them. He stopped in front
of me, shook his head and sighed. "Another case," he
said. He jabbed lightly at my nose, a gesture I didn't
appreciate.
"What's wrong?" asked Suzie.
"I'm afraid the worst has come," he said in his best
Paul Muni manner. "This poor unfortunate has recep
tion-room exhaustion."
"Golly, what's that?"
"You've heard of heat exhaustion. Well this is simi
lar, only the patient loses his senses looking at drapes
and paintings and wallpaper. We'll have to take him
away." 1 didn't see how the last statement fit into the
original plan.
"We had a date, but now I'll have to stay in and
study that horrible Western Civ." A tear came into
her eye. This girl was smarter than I had given he)'
credit for.
Jim motioned to the attendants to carry me away.
The last thing J heard as I was being gagged and tied
was Jim saying, "Maybe I could substitute? Hinmm?"
1 had been waiting for Suzie .some JO minutes in
Branner lobLy, thumbing through magazines J had
seen some hundred times before, if hot in women's
residences then in barber shops. Receptionists and
housemothers hold a vague terror for me. They de
velop a look that seems to suggest, young man, you
look like a rowdy to me, and I'll have you know that
our girls are well-bred ladies. Better behave.
Ten more minutes went by. 1 rose and started pacing
the floor. As I passed by the mirror, I would stop arid
gaze at myself, but even that got old. 'two middle
aged women and a child entered and sat down. The
little girl looked over at me, causing me to fortify
myself behind a magazine. Women of any aye unnerve
me.
After a few minutes, I cautiously peered over the
edge and there was the child's face starting al me. She
stood directly in front of me. She must have been at
that stage where all adults are parent:, to her, for she
said:
"Whose daddy are you?"
1 slumped down in my scat. One of the women came
over and took the child by the arm. "Don't bother
that boy, dear," she svid. Boy? Boy? I repeated to
myself. Oh, the stories I could unravel, I thought as I
pulled myself to a proud sitting Boy, indeed!
Thirty minutes of my youth had swept away, gone
into the process of flipping the pages of "Life" maga
zine, and still no Suzie. This had happened before,
and clearly something must be done. Being limited
in that fertile gray matter, J called Jirn and posed the
problem to him He reassured me and then (old me
his plan.
1 went back to the lobby, smiling a devilish smile.

Some in minutes later, Suzie came skipping in looking
like a cross between a canary and a great blue heron.
"Sorry to be late, but you'll forgive me, won't you,
dear boy?" she said. That word, "boy," again. She
smiled at me, but I only assumed a rigid position and
stared at the drapes, saying nothing in return.
"Are you all right?" She looked curiously al me. 1
knew ii was working. "You're angry because I'm a
teeny-weeny bitsy k.te, aren't you?" I continued to
stare at the drape. "You're being awfully silly. Be
sides, it's good tor your character." I remained im
mobile, like a yogi. "You've had your little joke—"
Just then Jim strode into the room, carrying a black
doctor's bag and bringing two pledges as attendants
carrying a stretcher with them. He stopped in front
of me, shook his head and sighed. "Another case," he
said. He jabbed lightly at my nose, a gesture I didn't
