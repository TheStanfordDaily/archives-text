# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Now that the freshmen have been tossed back into
the sun to ripen a little, we can get back lo business
with a Tuesday moaning session which has been de
signed to jar you from your chair, make you snort with
rage, and perhaps fling you into a .storming frenzy.

If not, you'll still have to admit
that it was a pretty good way to
start a column, and you should
know by now that this is definitely
not the time of year to be believ
ing promises.
I should start hy saying that if
I were running for a public ofiice
Hall should live so long instead
of waving big banners and shout
ing big shouts about the impor
tance of rejoining NSA, con
demning the loyalty oath at Cal,

supporting a program strengthening the IIR, and
recommending that the world be chopped into a flat
block instead of being allowed to wheel around in the
universe in its present rounded condition, I should turn
to the peasants and say something rather puny and
paltry, such as:
"Who was that lousy gatekeeper at the Sunken Dia
mond last Saturday who wouldn't allow a Stanford
student and his wife into the ballpark without paying
a fare fop their 1 -year-old baby?
The poor guy had already paid a 50-cent student
rate for himself, then had shelled out $1.20 for his
mate, and finally was forced to put down 30 en's more
for his kid, who could only say glub and blub, and
didn t know the difference between a baseball and A 1
Masters' head, and who wouldn't even have spilled
peanut shells all over the bleachers, which was about

the only thing that was any fun to do on such a windy
day during such a terrible game."
Something should be done!
Then I would say, "Why can't somebody get the
Lake Lag lifeguards off their chairs, so they could
form a crew to clean up some of the mess behind the
Boathouse and along the shore, which now looks like
a month-long picnic had just finished.
Or perhaps the student employment office, which
has a list a mile long of hopeful workers, could put
some of its unemployed to work on the problem.
"A little clean-up action down there would keep the
Lake from looking like a dirty typhoid pit."
Something should be done!
Then, maybe I could add something about my hot
idea of opening up Hoover Tower on Sunday so that
the old folks from home who came all the way out
frmo Kansas City to see the campus wouldn't be turned
away on the only day they had to see the place.
There's undoubtedly a rule against it, but here's an
other job for a name off that Employment Office list.
Somebody could open the tower on Sunday, collect a
slight fare for each ride, make some money for him
sr If. and earn enough for the University to hire a crew
to clean up the Lake.
Something should be done!
Then, if I had time I'd propose a plan to improve
Stanford's intra-mural softball fields, undoubtedly the
poorest mural diamonds in America today.
Something should be done!
Finally, I'd say something Abraham Lincolnish such
as "It takes the LITTLE things to make Stanford a BIG
University. Then I'd get sick all over the platform,
laugh in the voters' faces, and head for a fast gin fizz.
Something should be done!
