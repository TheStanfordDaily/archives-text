# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry
## 
### 
Spring foot hall practice has plodded its weary way through about hall of
its yearly allotment and we have at last reached a place where it is safe to
give a to-date summation. We have also reached a place where it is distinctly
dangerous to make predicition, but we may do a little of that too.
Coach Marchm<.nt Schwartz has an excellent group of gridsters on the
freshman field every afternoon. But they aren't Army. They aren't deep
enough. And they aren't, as yet, experienced or well drilled enough to go
down on record as a great machine. ,
But. as Marchie puts it, "We're a lot further along than we were last year
iM this time."
Yeah? You know that? OK, we'll take off on a run-down of the players as
we see them right now. It is Spring Practice 1950, and someday—the Gods
willing—it will be Autumn 1950. Q: Will it be what has been lovingly re
ferred to as "our year?" Well here's a list of some of the guys who may be
able to tell you.
The Main Baekfield problem is, of course, at the fullback spot which is
currently sans the services of Mitchell. DeYoung, and Buddy Klein.
The ace-in-Ilie-hole here is last year's fourth-stringer, who so tar in
practice has been looking like next year's first-stringer—Boh Griffcn.
Bob is a 191 -pound cruncher from San Francisco and right now is the
most consistent blocker in the two-back crowd. Behind GrilYen is last
year's best halfback, Bobby White, who has been temporarily moved to
full to help fill the aclung void. White, who was nothing short of mag
nificent in the last Big Game, will not. we think, be at full next fall. But
the spring practice in the middle man slot will do two things. It has
sharpened up White's blocking and it will give the 1950 Big Red Machine
another man they can turn to in the clutch at fullback.
Also at lull is last year's frosh captain, Skip Crist, who is 190 pounds of
eager, rough fullback. Crist needs experience, and his blocking to date is not
outstanding. But lie could very well come along last enough to be a starter
especially since his knee, injured in the UCLA Frosh tilt (Skip's best game
of last season), is holding up nicely. Also a dark horse in the fullback race is
Holy Boiuck, a sincere, hard-running fullback of last fall. Holy, however,
I.as been plagued by boils and injuries this spring and hasn't had a chance
to really show off his stuff.
Next fall the Redbirds will have four of the sweetest halfbacks in the
country galloping around the grid for them. One is, of course, White. An
other is Boyd Benson —who may be another "Perfect" Pete Kmetovic. Num
ber three is Eric Southwood, a straight-A student, who came along fast in
the waning days of last season and did notably well in the Trojan and Golden
Bear tilts. Fourth, and potentially the best, is Harry the Hipster Ilugasian,
who is passing the spring days for the JV horsehide field.
So that's the Big Four.
In order to give the halfback spot one of the few places with depth, we
have the moxie-filled Blondic Broome and the Papooses' transformed quar
terback Joe St. Geme at halfback. Broome is a little guy, but fast and gutty.
May hear from him. St. Geme was a good frosh quarterback, but no great
aw-shucks like Horn and Kerkorian. He has been moved to half and is look
ing better there than he ever did at qb. Joe is fast and has boo-coo football
knowhow. A little experience at the three-lour back spot will make him a
real threat.
Stanford's biggest woe in the halfback department is wrapped around
the graduation of one Davy Field and one Ken Peck, last fall's twin de
fensive aces. As of this moment, there is no one—in spite of abundance
of offensive murder—to play defensive halfback. Any one of the top
four, above mentioned, could probably handle the position, but this
would be at a sacrifice of offense. So this spot is wide open. Right now a
transfer named Wes Walters is about the best straight defensive half
out on the Freshman practice field. .
Bruce Van Alstyne, '49 defensive end, has been moved to the half spot, and
will probably pan out to be something deadly, but as of now the thing is a
little new to him. Also. Bruce may have to be doing a bit of offensive end
work next fall. So if anybody knows of a defensive halfback, please report
him to the SAC immediately.
The quarterback spot is again as pretty as four nces and a queen. Gary
Kerkorian and Dick Horn, or Dick Horn and Gary Kerkorian if you prefer,
have got the position sewed up as tight as an old maid's girdle. We think
that either one of them will be good enough to start for any team on the
Coast. l\ey came out last fell' With a lot of press clippings and a lot of re
sponsibility on their inexperienced shoulders. They did a splendid job, all
things considered. This year both of them have more confidence, more
experience, and more ability. Someday they may well be favorably com
pared with Notre Dame's one-two quarterback combination of Bertelli and
l.uiack of some years back. This is probably Stanford's strongest position.
All of which runs us out of space before we can reach the nerve center of
the Big Red Machine—the line. The next column (watch your newsstands)
will endeavor to shed some light in this department. Then with the Bench
after that we'll try to pull off a summary plus prospects of The Year ahead.
But before pulling down the tailgate on this edition, I want to thank
ace gridster, ace frat-bro, and ace buddy Jesse Cone for the swell (and
free) job he did on the new column head for The Bench. Thanks. Jess.
