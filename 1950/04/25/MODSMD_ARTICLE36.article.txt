OTIS CHANDLER, Stanford's gargantuan shot-putter, will be at
tempting to beat his best previous mark of 56 ft 3-4 in. against
the Bruins here Saturday. "Oates" set this all-time mark last
year on the wind-swept UCLA track when the Card spikesters
romped to a surprisingly easy victory. Saturday's meet will
again be a race between Chandler and Stanford's Lew Davis
for first-place honors.
