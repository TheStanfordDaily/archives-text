Iby half a game going into last
night's game with California at Em
; eryville. However, the Gaels had
j been unable to solve the California

jinx which had hung over them for |
four years.
This could be a make or break ,
week for any of the teams in the |
league, as the fifth-pliice team yes- '
terday, USC, was only one and a j
half games out of first place. Cali- j
fornia and St. Mary's each have
three games scheduled for the week. (
while Stanford, USC, UCLA, and .
Santa Clara each have a pair of j
games on the docket.
USC. team batting leader, drop
ped down to .307 during its two- j
game invasion of the north over the
weekend, but still holds a 48-point
lead over Santa Clara. USC's short- j
stop Bob Lillis still held on to first
place in individual batting, although
he dropped .643 to .478.
Team Batting Law
While Stanford's pitching staff
has allowed only 13 earned runs in
seven league games to lead the field
by a large margin in that depai't
ment, the batting needed to carry j
the Indians to the top has shown up
yet as the Indians register only
.239 in team batting.
Only three Stanford men are over I
the .250 mark at the present time, J
Bud Klein (.321). Dave Melton i
(321), and Dick Clegg (.320). Bud
Klein is in a four-way tie for home
run leadership with two, while
Bruce Cameron is the only man in
the league with two triples to his j
credit.
