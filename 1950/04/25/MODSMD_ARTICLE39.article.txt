### 
Stanford's frosh baseballers try
for three in a row when they
meet Bellartnine High on the
frosh diamond this afternoon. Ron
Boyer will probably pitch.
The Cardbabes' 20 to 8 victory
| over Mission and 5 to 1 triumph
! over San Mateo give evidence
that they are at last beginning to
j reach their bitting potential.
