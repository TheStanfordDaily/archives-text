# 'Meet Your Gridder'
## 
### MAGGIE BERNT 
(Editor's note; Ever since The
Daily put in m sport pace, nearly
all the women 011 the staff have
begged, pleaded, and tried to in
fluence the sports editor into let
ting them do a sports story. The
foremost this year of the would
be fein sportsters is a pretty,
dimpled freshman named Maggie
Be rut. Maggie's main aim was to
interview and present the wom
an's angle on the gridstcrs now
out for spring football. The fol
lowing is her first column 011 the
subject. It will also be her last.
But with a happy nod to the toilâ€”
intf gridmcn we would like to
put this piece into print. Take it
away, Maggie!)
He stands over there ... a little
aloof from the rest of the players.
You notice him at once . . . maybe
it's the brightness of his eyes with
the promise of hidden laughter be
hind them . . . or maybe it's the
impish dimple in his cheek. But
whatever it is about Joe Shlunk,
you know you're'going to like him
at once.
As busy as he Is in tlie middle of
scrimmage,' he'll take a few minutes
off to talk to you, and the way he
smiles at you, you know he's just a
little shy about being interviewed,
"Why, shucks, me . . his eyes
seem to say. "Who'd want to inter
view me? . . But the puzzled
frown on his brow slowly melts
away as you talk, and soon his
warm, slow voice fills the air, and
all the shouting and screaming of
the practice fades into nothingness.
"Football . . . well, jeepers," he
drawls, as he quietly shifts his 230-
pound frame from one foot to the

other. "I dunno ... it just sortn
seemed the thing to do on a nice
afrternoon. Sorta always played at
it . . . you know . . . practiced most
afternoons and went to the games
and played on Saturdays."
That's all he says . . . nothing
about the shining gold statues you
know he's won as the most valuable
player . . . nothing about the pages
of adjectives you know his mother
must have collected in an old scrap
book at home . . . pages that have
turned yellow with time and con
stant reading . . . pages that are
collected not only in the pages of
the scrapbook but also within his
mother's heart.
But now his steady gaze brings
you out of your revery. "Coach's
calling me. I think he wants me for
the next play. I better go."
He holds out his large, friendly
hand. "It's been awful nice to meet
you," he smiles.
And then he's gone. Again you
hear the tumult of the field, the ex
citement in the voices as practice
resumes. And as you take a last
look at the field, you see Joe Shlunk
among the players, his head held
high, his bearing dignified. And
you think that there is someone you
can be proud to know.
