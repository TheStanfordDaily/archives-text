# Alpiners--Two Miles Up
## 
### 

THIS IS HOW YOSEMITE looked to Henry Stauffer, Jim Moore,
Cliff Hopson, and Karl Stauffer, four of the five Alpine Clubbers
who took a 60-mile cross-country ski tour during the spring vaca
tion. Highest point reached by the party was Red Pass, 11,500
feet, over the Clark Range. The skiers have become rock-climb
ers this spring. A trip up Lower Cathedral Spire in Yosemite is
planned for May, as well as hikes up Half Dome.
