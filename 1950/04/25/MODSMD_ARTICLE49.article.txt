# Lounge, Rec Rooms Redone
## 
### 
Thanks to the Stanford Mothers'
Club and the Pajo Alto Tied Cross
ehaptcr, Village students were
greeted this spring quarter with a
redecorated recreation room and
lounge in the Village Clubhouse.
The recreation room, before the
transformation a drab base room,
was selected by the Red Cross as a
project when Harold Parker, head of
Student Personnel Services at the
Village, spoke of the inadequate fa
cilities to Red Cross officials.
Furniture was reupholstered and
painted, rugs, tables, cards, and other
conveniences were installed in the
renovation. The work was under the
direction of Mrs. Grace T. Decius,
volunteer interior decorator.
The Mothers' Club decided to as
sume the cost of the redecorating,
since the University funds were not
available for thi:; purpose. That move
was made on the suggestion of a
Mothers' Club committee composed
of Mrs. Lawrence Kimpton, Mrs.
Frederick Tcrman, and Mrs. E. W.
Laub.
With the completion of the project,
the nearly 1,000 Village students were
provided with an adequate "living
room" in which to relax. There is
even a supply of fire wood available
for the fireplace.
