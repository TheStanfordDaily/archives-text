# Remodeling to Skirt Now On Inner Quad Building
## 
### 
Three more buildings on Stan
ford's Inner Quadrangle will be re
modeled fliis spring and summer as
another step in a long-range pro
gram to modernize this academic
center of the University.
President Wallace Sterling, in an
nouncing approval of the project by
the Board of Trustees, said that the
buildings to be reconstructed were
formerly used by the Law School,
which now has a handsome new
home in the remodeled Administra
tion Building.
Two of the buildings are*on either
side of Memorial Court. They were
formerly the law library and law
offices and classrooms. The third—
Building' 100, one-time Little The
ater before construction of Memo
rial Hall—is a large lecture room
which was used primarily for law
courses.
The reconstruction work, which
will provide two floors within the
present framework of all three
buildings, which now have only one
floor, wi'l cost $225,000 and will
nearly double available space in the
buildings.
First step in the long-term pro
gram of redeveloping the entire In
ner Quad as the center of the Uni
versity's acadcmic life and of stu
dent services was the remodeling
and doub'c-dccking of the Petrog
raphy Building last summer. The
Mineralogy Building on the Outer
Quad was similarly improved at the
same time.
Dr. Sterling said that the trustees
have approved the program of mod
ernizing all academic buildings on

the Inner Quad as funds becomc
available.
The three remodeled buildings,
which arc expected 1o be ready by
September, will be occupied by the
offices of the Dean of Students,
which are now located in temporary
buildings behind the School of Edu
cation.
They will also include facilities
for the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences and the Dean of Graduate
Study, who are now housed in one
of the buildings—Building 1, which
is .just o(T Memorial Court and ad
joining Building 100.
Building 1 was the office of Stan
ford's first president, David Starr
Jordan, and it also housed the reg
istrar's office in the early days of
the University.
Dr. Sterling said that the ultimate
disposition of the temporary build
ings vacated under this move has
not been decided, but they will
probably remain where they are for
emergency use for the time being.
Working drawings are now being
prepared, following authorization of
the remodeling work by the Board
of Trustees, and bids will be called
for as soon as the drawings are
completed. It is expected construc
tion work will start within a few
weeks.
The program of redeveloping and
modernizing the Inner Quad is a
good deal more economical than
constructing new buildings, the
president pointed out. It will cost
approximately $6.25 a square foot
to remodel these three buildings,
compared to the $ 14-18 which it
would cost per square foot to build
similar new facilities.
