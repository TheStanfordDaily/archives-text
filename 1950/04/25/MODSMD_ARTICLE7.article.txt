# Hainan Island Ready to Fall
## 
### 
HONG KONG, April 24 (AP) —The Chinese Communists are ex
pected to gain complete control of Hainan Island in four days to
a week. -
They owe their quick victory not to the estimated 10,000 to
15,000 regular troops they put ashore starting one week ago, but

to more than 60,000 local guerrillas
who efiectively struck the island's
garrison forces.
The Nationalists had about 125,-
000 regular troops, plus a 100-plane
air force and a small navy, yet they
folded like the proverbial house of
cards.
When this- correspondent left the
temporary Nationalist headquarters
at Yulin on the south coast Monday
morning, the top Nationalist com
manders were packing to flee by sea
during the day.
"Total Lvacuatoin"
A highly placed general said the
Nationalist president, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai - shek, had ordered
"total evacuation" of the 13,500-
square-milc island.
The Hainan governor, Gen. Chen
Chi - tang, said the situation was
"hopeless" and the only solution
was whether he could get out ahead
of the Reds. Not many ordinary
troops are likely to escape.
Guerrillas in Hills
Guerrillas, said by the National
ists to total 40,000, were in the hills
only 21 miles north of Yulin, wait
ing to pounce. Three small freight
ers and a navy landing craft were
standing by to take the high Na
tionalists aboard.
The Samah airfield, 15 miles dis
tant, was almost deserted. The air
forcc was down to eight B-25 bomb
ers, one P-51 fighter, two C-46
transports, and an AT-6 trainer.
Many already had flown away.
