# Exchange Chappie Hits Stands Today
## 
### 
This month's Chappie is a direct
j product of ,spring fever. Yr\s, the
j Old Roy whs too lazy to write his
I own magazine, and the result is an
other exchange issue, complete
with jokes, cartoons, features, and
stories stolen from other campus
humor magazines.
This collection, enclosed in an
i Everett Opie covcr guaranteed to
i touch your heart, goes on sale to
day at the usual places---the Cellar,
the post office, and the four corners
of the Quad.
Featured, among other tidbits, is
a cartoon center spread by some
body named Riggio from the Dart
mouth Jackolantern. It's entitled
"We Know Where You're Going."
