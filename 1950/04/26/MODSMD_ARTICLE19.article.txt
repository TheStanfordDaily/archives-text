## Today's the Day 
### 
Today's the day. The grand finale for two weeks of intensive
campaigning by candidates who want to serve you in your stu- j
dent government.
And today marks only the beginning for the candidates you
choose to serve.
Every office which will be filled by today's election carries
heavy responsibilities. But more immediate is your responsibility
to elect the best-qualified candidates.
The 40 per cent turnout for the primary election was only me
diocre. About 135 students appeared at the election rally yester
day morning.
This lack of interest indicates little in the way of hope for next
year's student leaders.
The best contribution you can make to your student govern
ment is to get out and vote for your choice .... vote foi the can
didate you believe to be best qualified.
"And may the best man win . "
