# Excom to Open NSA Question For 2nd Time
## 
### 
Excom will reopen the National
Student Association issue when
they meet tonight at 7.
The Stanford NSA Committee is
seeking reinstatement under a re
duced budget. ASSU President
Hank Rosin will lead off the dis
cussion by reading to Excom a let
ter from K. W. Longshore, a South
ern California NSA leader, criticiz
i ing Stanford's decision to disaffiliate
with the national organizatnon.
A draft of the letter of disaffilia
tion will then be read. If Excom
votes to reopen hearings on NSA's
status, NSA regional president Dick
Kelton plans to enumerate the ben
efits Stanford can and has obtained
from national membership.
A by-law which would make it
a violation of the election code to
mark The Daily with campaign lit
erature will be discussed. The
measure was tabled last week.
Changes will also be made in the
Athletic and Activities Committee
by-laws.
