# Today's Referendum Issues
## 
### 
The fate ol lour pioposed amendments to
our ASSU Constitution will be decided today
by your votes. These are reform proposals, de
signed to improve our student government.
11 passed, these amendments will serve this
goal in two ways:
/. They will clarify certain provisions of the
Constitution where recent events h<jve shown
that clarification is definitely needed.
2. They will provide more efficient govern
ment through new provisions.
The Daily believes that all four amendments
should be incorporated into the ASSU Consti
tution. We urge you to vote "YES" on jII refer
endum proposals.
VOTE YES on Pioposal 1: This pro
vides for a clarification of the qualifications for
candidacy lor the Council for Student Control
and the ASSU presidency.
As the qualifications now stand, a student
must have completed specified total units of
work to run for a Council post or for the presi
dency.
Many would-be candidates have interpreted
this to mean that if, say, 75 units are required,
this means five quarters at Stanford, according
to the policy of averaging 15 units per quarter.
However, the provision actually means that the
specified number of units must be completed.
Under the new wording, which will provide
in each case a requirement of specified units
OR the equivalent quarters of work, a student
who wishes to become a candidate for the
Council or the presidency will not be penal
ized if he has taken a light schedule which can
be made up later.
VOTE YES on Proposal II: This pro
vides for a "staggering' of the election and
terms of office of representatives on the ASSU
Executive Committee.
The purpose is to have an overlap of Excom
members from year to year, so that there will
be "old hands" on the committee at all times,
rather than starting with a completely new
body every fall.
This will furnish an additional, and badly
needed means of continuity in ASSU policy
from year to year.

VOTE YES on Proposal III: The amend
ment would prohibit an Honor Code violator
from serving on the Council for Student Con
trol, which reviews all cases involving such
violations.
The purpose of the Honor Code is to promote
honesty and fairness in academic work.
If a student is convicted of a Code violation,
he is suspended from Stanford to give him time
to "think it over." to begin to realize that his
actions were not in his own, or others', best
interests.
The fact that there are second violations, un
fortunately, shows that the Code does not al
ways achieve its purpose.
If an "unreformed" Code violator were to
serve on the judicial body that judges his fel
low Code violators, he could do a great deal
of harm to the Honor Code.
He would be in a position to offer a violator
straws of rationalization to cling to, to justify
his violation. This would defeat the entire pur
pose of the Code with respect to that offender,
who might otherwise see the error of his act.
There can be no justification for a violation of
the Code.
There is always the chance that this amend
ment would keep a "reformed" violator, who
has learned the Code's meaning the hard way,
from doing good on the Council. But are the
odds worth the gamble? We think not. An
"unreformed" violator can do more harm than
a "reformed" violator can do good.
Don't gamble with these stakes .... the
Honor Code's effectiveness in achieving the
goal of fairness in learning. Vote yes on Pro
posal 111.
VOTE YES on Proposal IV: As the Con-1
stitution now stands co-operative living groups
must deposit their funds with the Students'
Organizations Fund.
Proposal IV would exempt these groups
(Hilltop House, Chinese Club House, Tamarack
Lodge) from such requirement.
There is no reason why these groups should J
bank with the ASSU. In fact, they have not
been doing so, in violation of the Constitution. :
This amendment would also provide for an
annual audit of the financial records of these
groups, for review by the Dean of Students.
