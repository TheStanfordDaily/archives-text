# CAMPUS OPINION
## Honor Code and Council Elections 
### 
To the Editor:
A proposed amendment to the Judicial Section of the
ASSU Constitution states that "No student who has
been convicted of an Honor Code violation may be a
candidate for the Council of Student Control." We feel
that our student government should not remain static
and should seriously consider every suggestion for its
improvement. Before we vote today, however, we
should weigh the possible advantages of this amend
ment against its obvious disadvantages.
Such a change would eliminate the necessity of
judging students who had violated the Honor Code
on their present merits, since these students woidd
nut be allowed run for Men's or Women's Council. It
would change the emphasis from individual responsi
bility, prevention of Honor Code violations rather than
punishment of them, to an authoritai ian emphasis with
a listing of once-violators as suspects for further pun
ishment. If these are considered as benefits, they
would possibly be achieved by enacting this amend
ment.
On the other hand, in a democratic system, do we not
consider it a privilege to have the opportunity to judge
c-ach candidate on his present merits? This privilege
would be denied us by this arbitrary rule. One of the
basic doctrines taught in Poly Sci I is that a person

shall not be placed in double jeopardy— that is, a per
son may not be punished twice for the same offense.
Yet, is this not parallel to what we are doing here?
A person convicted of an Honor Code violation is
suspended for one or two quarters from the University,
but, after that time, the University admits this person
with all the rights and privileges accorded to a new
student. This amendment is an added punishment for
this person—an added barrier to his progress and
achievement in an educational system. Stanford is an
Educational Institution where we have a chance to
know each other and where we can have a real basis
for faith in each other's growth and improvement.
I'll is proposed amendment denies us the privilege of
exercising our judgment in another person's ability.
Before we vote, let's think over this Honor Code
amendment—does the proposed method lead to any
results which are not already achieved by the much
simpler technique of the ballot that is, electing only
competent people to Council positions—and does not
this method negate its own goal—the growth of indi
vidual responsibility, which is the basis of the Honor
Code?
