# Water Carnival Confusion
## 
### 
To the Editor:
As you say in Monday':; Daily in reference to the
abysmal fiasco that masqueraded la;.t Saturday a:* the
Junior Water Carnival, the Life protographer was in
conspicuous, if there at all. It seems to us that the
poor guy took one look around, packed up his equip
ment, and left with a natural feeling that the whole
idea was one of those mistakes that editors some
times make.
At least, let's hope that Life never finds room to print
what pictures might, have been taken, because the
logical thing lor a copy writer to do would be to title
It "Life Goes to A Confusion" and proceed to undo
the good work of the Stanford Publicity Department
by tearing us limb from limb.
Unfortunately, the blame loi the complete lack of
organization must rest rather heavily on the shoulders
ol the class of '51, and the chairman of I he planning
committee in particular. There were too many things
that could have been done to make (he affair run
smoothly that were not done.
For instance, simply sending out the entry blanks a
week earlier would have kept the Water Carnival
chairmen of the various living groups from being
driven to the edge of nervous breakdowns from over
work; publishing a list .stating the order of the floats
before the time for the parade to start might have cut
the confusion about 50 per cent. And at least check
the sign-up list to sec that there are no duplicate
themes. (Are we wrong, or is it still first come, first
served? There was duplication.)
We could go on for a long time listing the things
that should have been done, or done belter by the
committee concerning the timing, (at least '?.<) hardy

souh> stayed to watch the bathing suit contest when il
filially got started at 5:30) and the safety precautions
(ii Moat crashed into the Boathouse dock during the
parade when ordered to turn off its motor, a precau
tion more dangerous to the riders of the Hoat than was
the motor to unauthorized swimmers nearby; a student
v/as badly injured in another easily preventable acci
dent), but the Carnival is behind us now.
The important point is that the Water Carnival can
be directed intelligently, as wus proven last year.
This year's Carnival was more important to Stanford
than il v.'ill be for some time, and il was badly mis
handled; don't let it happen again. Maybe (he class
of lt2 can do a better job; they couldn t do a worse.

To the Editor:
We, the undersigned, are unhappy about an inac
curacy of reporting in the Water Carnival story; we
are not the Phi Delt Band, a fact which might have
been observed readily from (he m.c.'s official list ol
floats. We registered as "Der Stanford Bande,' which
is a German band group made up of Toyon and Village
residents. We are all members of the Stanford Con
cert Band, and inasmuch as various individuals in our
roup have played in the University Orchestra, Spring
Show, and Gaieties orchestras, we consider ourselves
accomplished amateur musicians, though Saturday's
p< rformance certainly did not indicate it. We do not
wish to be confused in any way with the I'hi Dell
noisemake rs.

We, the undersigned, are unhappy about an inac
curacy of reporting in the Water Carnival story; we
are not the Phi Delt Band, a fact which might have
been observed readily from (he m.c.'s official list ol
floats. We registered as "Der Stanford Bande,' which
is a German band group made up of Toyon and Village
residents. We are all members of the Stanford Con
cert Band, and inasmuch as various individuals in our
roup have played in the University Orchestra, Spring
Show, and Gaieties orchestras, we consider ourselves
accomplished amateur musicians, though Saturday's
p< rformance certainly did not indicate it. We do not
wish to be confused in any way with the I'hi Dell

As you say in Monday':; Daily in reference to the
abysmal fiasco that masqueraded la;.t Saturday a:* the
Junior Water Carnival, the Life protographer was in
conspicuous, if there at all. It seems to us that the
poor guy took one look around, packed up his equip
ment, and left with a natural feeling that the whole
idea was one of those mistakes that editors some
times make.
At least, let's hope that Life never finds room to print
what pictures might, have been taken, because the
logical thing lor a copy writer to do would be to title
It "Life Goes to A Confusion" and proceed to undo
the good work of the Stanford Publicity Department
by tearing us limb from limb.
Unfortunately, the blame loi the complete lack of
organization must rest rather heavily on the shoulders
ol the class of '51, and the chairman of I he planning
committee in particular. There were too many things
that could have been done to make (he affair run
smoothly that were not done.
For instance, simply sending out the entry blanks a
week earlier would have kept the Water Carnival
chairmen of the various living groups from being
driven to the edge of nervous breakdowns from over
work; publishing a list .stating the order of the floats
before the time for the parade to start might have cut
the confusion about 50 per cent. And at least check
the sign-up list to sec that there are no duplicate
themes. (Are we wrong, or is it still first come, first
served? There was duplication.)
We could go on for a long time listing the things
that should have been done, or done belter by the
committee concerning the timing, (at least '?.<) hardy

souh> stayed to watch the bathing suit contest when il
filially got started at 5:30) and the safety precautions
(ii Moat crashed into the Boathouse dock during the
parade when ordered to turn off its motor, a precau
tion more dangerous to the riders of the Hoat than was
the motor to unauthorized swimmers nearby; a student
v/as badly injured in another easily preventable acci
dent), but the Carnival is behind us now.
The important point is that the Water Carnival can
be directed intelligently, as wus proven last year.
This year's Carnival was more important to Stanford
than il v.'ill be for some time, and il was badly mis
handled; don't let it happen again. Maybe (he class
