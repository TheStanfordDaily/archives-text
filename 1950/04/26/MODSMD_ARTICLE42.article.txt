## Cards to Vie With Gaels For Top Rung of Ladder 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
« tanford s varsity horsehiders journey to Moraga this after- I
noon to battle St. Mary's for the top rung on the CIBA ladder. The
Gaels maintained their slight half-game lead over the Indians
Monday night by coming from behind to tie California 8 to 8 in
a twelve-inning contest at Emeryville.
A victory today would put the Cards on top of the pack by half

a game over St. Mary's and Cali
fornia.

To date the Gaels have been a
S surprise in the red - hot pennant
j chase. S.t Mary's got oH to a flying
I start by dumping UCLA twice in
; the Southland to start the season
I and then took their third straight
I by defeating Santa Clura.
California, which hasn't lost to
St. Mary's since the war, has been
the only team able to halt the high
flying Moragans. The Bears stopped
the Gaels twice, while St. Mary's ■
was taking the third and final game
ol their JLJCLA series. Monday
night's tie game has been claimed as
a moral victory for Si. Mary's, who |
figure they have finally unraveled
the Cal jinx.
Gael Pitcher Unknown
St. Mary's pitching choice for this
afternoon is a big question mark. J
Gael Coach Johnny Vergez used
four chuckers in Monday night's
game. Carroll Canfield, mainstay of
the Gael mound corps, will prob
ably not see action as he pitched '
eight innings Saturday and four
more frames Monday night.
Indian mentor Everett Dean will
start Joe Chez, who at the present
time is leading the league with
three wins and no losses to his cred
it. The "old fireman," Dave Stott, !

win ue standing toy m the bull-pen,
in case he is needed.
Same Lineup
With the possible exception of
Jim Trabueco, who turned his ankle
rounding first base in Saturday's
game with (JSC, the line-up will be
the same that started the Trojan
contest.
Bill Herron will be behind the !
plate Hashing signals to Chez, while 1
Dick Clegg will hold down the ini
tial sack with Tom Shaw at second.
Bruce Cameron will be in the hot
corner at third, and co-captain Dave
Melton will round out the infield at
shortstop.
Bud KJein will be in left field, !
and co-captain Charlie Cole will
patrol the center field Harden. If
1 rabucco is unable to go in light
field, either John Claypool or Tony
Stellar will probably get the start
ing nod.
