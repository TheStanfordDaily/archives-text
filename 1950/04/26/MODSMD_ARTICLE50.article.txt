# Frosh Horsehiders Beat Bellarmine Hi
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's frosh baseballers con- I
tinued their winning ways as they |
humbled Bellarmine High School, 11 j
to 3, on the frosh diamond yesterday.
Jack Shepard, fiery catcher, was
easily the outstanding player on the
field, as he collected four hits in as
many trips to the plate, driving in five
runs.
Although the 11 to 3 score indi
cates that ihe yearlings had little
trouble in winning, such was not the
case. Bellarmine led, 3 to 2, for three j
of the seven innings, and it wasn't
until the fifth and sixth innings that |
Stanford found its hitting eye.
Bells Score First
The Bells scored first, reaching j
pitcher Ron Boyer for two runs in j
the first. Ron Palma walked, Bill Mc-
Pherson singled, and Bud Belardi did
likewise to bring in Palma. McPher- j
son tallied on Jack O'Keele's one
baser.

Stanford countered with two runs
of their own in the initial inning, as
shortstop Dick Cole walked, center
fielder Al Stellar shot a single to left,
and both came marching home on
Shepard's double.
The Bells grabbed a one-run lead
in the third when they combined a
walk by Belardi and a single by
O'Keefe into a run. The Papooses
tied things up in the fourth on the
strength of Clayton McGill's walk
and Buyer's double.
Stellar's Double Starts Rally
The game broke wide open in the
fifth as Stellar greeted pitcher Don
Dolan with an automatic double that
bounced, over the centerfield wall.
Shepard drove in Stellar with a single
between the groping shortstop and
third baseman. The crowning blow
of the game came next when power
ful George Zaninovich boomed an
inside-the-park home run into right
field. A Ruthian blow in every re
spect, Zaninovich trotted home with
time to spare.
The Cardbabes added five super
fluous runs in the sixth as Frank
Yapp, Gene Shirley, Cole, Stellar,
and Shepard scored.
