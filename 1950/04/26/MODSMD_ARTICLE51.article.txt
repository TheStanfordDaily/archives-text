# Biz School II Pounds V-214
## 
### 
Eneina, Village, and Biz School
took over the mural spotlight yester
day, as the fraternities were idle.
Biz School II pounded Village 214
into submission, 12 to 3. The Biz Boys
displayed plenty of power on the field
as well as at the plate, throwing out
three potential Village runs at home.
Village 304 took a 7 to 4 decision
from Village 316. Bill Hughes fea
tured the winners' attack with a
booming home run.
In the featured Encina contest, 2E
I defeated 3W, 11 to 7. The 2E boys
jumped on 3W starting pitcher Bruce
Murphey for six runs in the first in
ning, were held scoreless in the sec
ond, then added two more in the
third.
Alter 3W squeezed across two un
earned runs in their half of the sec
ond, Don Liebendorfer, their third
hurler, allowed 2E to match them
with two in the top of the fourth.
In the last of the fourth, Monte
Herring, 2E chucker, weakened and
grew wild. 3W managed to rally for
fitfe tallies, but still fell short.
In the second frame, something of
a baseball rarity occurred. Herring
walked five straight men, but al
lowed no runs. Luck and the ster
ling defensive play of his 2E team
mates combined to pick the men ott
base before any damage occurred.
