# Four ASSU President Candidates Speak
## 
### 
I think that everyone should vote
today. I believe that student gov
j eminent should play a more vital
role in each student's life. ASSU
! should not be operated as a "closed
{ corporation." If elected I will try
I for a closer relationship between
j the ASSU and the individual stu
j dent. Student government is what
wc make it.

The efficiency with which the
needs and desires of the student
body are met is in direct proportion !
to the efficiency of the student body
j president. In this light, it is evi- j
dent that an active and successful j
I student government needs strong
leadership in all phases of its organ
ization—especially in the student!
body presidency. Realizing this, and
feeling that there arc no issues j
pressing enough to demand the
nebulous promises of political cam
paigns, I wish, through a genuine
interest in the student body as a
whole, to achieve this overall effi
ciency in all phases of our student
; government.

I believe in increased participa-j
i tion in student government. Those*
i words have been thrown around in!
j every past campaign here at Stan-;>
lord, but participation has not sub-.'
stantially increased. The student,,
government I'd like to work in J
however, is one which realizes theji
actual regard in which student self-'i
government is held by much of the<>
public, yet constantly works toward
making this government more re-f
sponsible and more useful.
When our government improvesl
in these things and achieves a high
er place in public thinking, thenj
and then only will we get increased!
participation.
Common sense and hard work arel
the only answers. {

I am hesitant to establish an in
bxible platform of campaign prom
jes, many of which may be valid
pday and outmoded tomorrow. Is
les should be considered on their
wn merits and not on past prom
;es. Rather, I would pledge myself
) a policy of co-operation and eo
»rdination within student govern
ment, and not domination of it.
As chairman of the Executive
ommittee, and as a member of all
SSU committees, the president
lould concern himself largely with
ic co-ordination of those commit
•es. By making careful appoint
ments, and then by placing full con
dence in those appointees, I would
incerely work toward that goal of
o-ordination.
