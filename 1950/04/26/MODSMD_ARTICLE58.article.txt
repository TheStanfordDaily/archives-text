# Vice-Presidential Statements
## 
### 
MARION RRUMMELL: Bcttei
publicity for campus activities and
closer co-ordination between ASSU
officers, Ex com, and campus organi
zations can make next year's ASSU
better than ever. These are my aims
and my hopes. Your votes can give
me the opportunity to make them
reality.
JAN EDWARDS: Generally, my
main ideas include stressing co-op
eration and co-ordination in all
fields, developing policies and plans
that have been started plus adding
and subtracting what the students
want and support—clear mysteries,
cut red tape, and publicize events.
I'd like anything you've got — Ist,
2nd, 3rd votes—but preferably firsts.
JOYCE GRAYBIEL: The main
issue I am stressing and working
toward is student enthusiasm. If
all - campus events are properly
publicized, and made interesting to
everyone, they will go over 100 per
cent better. Stanford is a school
where everyone has a chance to
know everyone else; for this reason
I would work for Village - campus
get-togethers and more firesides.
JO LYON: The vice-president has
a two-fold responsibility: to main
tain the co-ordination of campus
activities and to analyze the social
needs of the students and devise
means to satisfy those needs. I
feel with my experience on Cardi
nals and as chairman of the Red
Cross Drive, I'm qualified for the
position, and would sincerely ap
preciate this opportunity.


FOUR ASSU vice-presidential finalists are (1. to r.): Joan Lyon
Jan Edwards, Joyce Graybiel, and Marion Brummell.
