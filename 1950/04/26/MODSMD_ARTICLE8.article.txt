THIS AERIAL VIEW shows the building (arrow) razed by fire
and its proximity to the University of California's $9,000,000
atom-smashing cyclotron (upper left). The building destroyed
housed a laboratory, research and general engineering sec
tions, and administration quarters. The cyclotron is located on
a hillside above the campus in Berkeley.
