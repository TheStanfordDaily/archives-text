# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
'Things had almost shaped up at The Daily Shack
last night. Elections were over the coke machine had
• -ekes, half the staff was home waiting for the measles,
and I was collecting a dollar because the Seals had
blasted the Oaks. It was a happy moment.
And"it was" is the right terminology, as just then

my old pal Charlie came slithering
into the Shack, looking like he
usually does, but trying to fool
everybody by talking like a hu
man.
"Look," he said, as he pushed
me into a corner and started to
•pit in my face. "Where do you
get off saying that Stanford's
intra-mural .Softball fields aren't
any good?"
I didn't say that," 1 interrupted.
I said that they 'were undoubt
. ,11., I ,lt>mn,.,l.

• dly the poorest mural diamonds in America today.
"Hah-ha, you made a funny," he said generously,
but sarcastically.
"Hah-hah, so did your family," I said, not so gen
- lously, and with twice as much sarcasm.
But nothing stops good old Charlie. He started to
mile, then twisted his mouth the other way, and bo-
ted, "Yeah, well Stanford's mural diamonds aren't
so bad, and 1 ought to know because I'm an umpire on
one ot 'em."
"Oh," 1 said out loud, but thought to myself, "That
explains a lot ol things. The only thing in the world

worse than Stanford's mural diamonds are Stanford's
mural umpires."
Charlie started to say something else, but suddenly
he dropped to the Moor. 1 put down the club 1 had been
lading behind my back, looked at liiin lying there in a
heap, smiled a deadly sort of a smile, and then rolled
him over on his face, saying, "Good old Charlie, lie
just doesn't have it."
How could anybody defend Stanford's mural dia
monds? They're laid out in the wrong directions, hall
of them haven't got baselines, they overlap so that the
outfielders keep running into each other like Hhi Delts
at Dinah's, and the pitching mounds are about as de
veloped as Margaret O'Brien.
Then, there's always Diamond Five, which is set in
the middle ot the polo field. One of the.se days there
may be quite a collision out in centerfield between
polo pony, polo player, polo ball, centerfielder, and
.softball. The polo ball will probably outlast the others,
but that's not the point.
The point is on the person's head who put together
the diamonds in the first place.
A lew backstops could help things along consider
ably, so could some new bases, a lawn mower for that
outfield forest, and a switching of a few diamonds to
the other side of the field so that the sun, which has a
habit of being in the same place every afternoon, won't
blind the entire defensive unit.
With this in mind, 1 looked back down at good old
Charlie, lying helpless on the floor, picked up my club
again, and bashed him three more times over the head.
That guy is really out of it.
