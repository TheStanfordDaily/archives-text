# IIR Handbook Ready in May
## 
### 
"Introduction to Europe and Latin-
America â€” Summer, 11150"' will be
ready for student travelers the third
week in May.
The handbook, compiled and pub
lished by the Survey Committee of
the lIR, lists individuals', Stanford
almuni, and organizations in both
hemispheres interested in receiving
Stanford students. General travel
conditions and specific cultural
events, such as music festivals, drama
seasons, sports exhibitions, are speci
fied.
These and other incidental sug
gestions were garnered from con
sulates in this country and abroad,
foreign students on campus, Stan
ford students with experience abroad,
recipients of SIRO aid among other
sources. The committee's purpose, in
addition to personal service,*is to pro
mote a greater rapport between
countries than that achieved on the
customary tourist level.
Students will be asked to sign up
for the free handbooks in their liv
ing groups during the next two
weeks. They can be collected in the
lIR Office toward the end of May.
