Most towns grow up aimlessly—
around a general store, a few estates,
a railroad, or an industry such as a
I lumber camp.
Senator Stanford knew a town
would grow up around his Hedgling
university, and he knew what type
of a town he wanted. He didn't want
the town crowding the University
[ grounds, nor did he want liquor close
to his University.
j But the history of Palo Alto begins
over 100 years before Senator Stan
! ford's agent filed a map of the town
| with the county recorder on Febru
| ary 27, 1HH!).
Porlola's Expedition
It begins in 17G9 when Caspar de
Porlola's expedition camped under
J the big sequoia tree which has given
| Palo Alto its name, and decided that
this green country with an overflow
ing creek would be a good site for a
I mission.
When De An/a arrived with his ex
: pedilion in 1777, the creek had dried
| up and the grass was brown. So no
I mission was built. Instead 2,U00 acres
| around the tree were given to a son
of a member of the expedition.
The gold miners ol '49 came to the
Peninsula to get rich quick and small
towns mushroomed within the sight
of the big tree- —Menlo Park, Red
wood City, Mayfield. but Palo Alto
remained grazing land for a few big
rancheros until the railroad puffed
its way down from San Francisco in
'63.
Wealthy Families
With the railroad came a dozen of
San Francisco's wealthiest families to
build their summer homes. The pres
j ent Stanford Village was the site of
| the home of Mark Hopkins and his
i son Timothy. Timothy later became
Stanford's agent and founded Palo
! Alto in his name.
i The gracefully pillared and porti
-1 coed Hopkins home was bought by
Universal Studios and carted down
the state to Hollywood where it now
I ::erves as a movie set.
Stanford called his estate the Palo
| Alto Farm because he found the
name in common use on the laud he
I bought bounding the tall tree and the
J Sari Franeisquito Creek.
Outlaw Saloons
After founding his University,
| Stanford offered to make Mayfield
the University town if the town out
lawed saloons. Mayfield refused, not
merely because the liquor business
was so lucrative, but because very
I few people thought the University
j had the slightest chance of success-
Mr. Miller, class of 1901, was the
J first mail carrier in Palo Alto. He
! served from lftt)4-U. He was manager
of the Stanford Bookstore from 1913-
; HU and is now the best known au
i thority on Palo Alto and the sur
j rounding country.
'No Need For School'
An article in the New York Mail
and Express stated that "There is no
! more need for another university in
i California than for a home for de
j eayed sea captains in Switzerland."
Originally what is now College
Terrace look the name of Palo Alto.
Today's town named Palo Alto was
culled University Park. College Ter
race put on a blatant advertising
campaign of "cheap land values,"
I "good investment," "growing univer
j sityinferring that Senator Stanford
was most interested in making money
J from his university land.
When several of his friends in the
j East told the Senator that "they
never dreamed he would do such a
thing," he angrily filed suit against
! the real estate company for their use
! of the name which he claimed he
owned. The case was settled out of
court, the name was changed to Col
lege Terrace, and the name of Palo
! Alto was given to the present city.

Porlola's Expedition

Porlola's expedition camped under
J the big sequoia tree which has given

this green country with an overflow
ing creek would be a good site for a
I mission.
When De An/a arrived with his ex
: pedilion in 1777, the creek had dried
| up and the grass was brown. So no
I mission was built. Instead 2,U00 acres
| around the tree were given to a son
of a member of the expedition.
The gold miners ol '49 came to the
Peninsula to get rich quick and small
towns mushroomed within the sight
of the big tree- —Menlo Park, Red
wood City, Mayfield. but Palo Alto
remained grazing land for a few big
rancheros until the railroad puffed
its way down from San Francisco in
'63.
