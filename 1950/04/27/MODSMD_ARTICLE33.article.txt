# Cards Take Over First Place in CIBA Race
## Heinen Stars in Relief Role As Stanford Edges St. Mary's 
### PETE GROTHE 
In one of those games one
reads about but seldom sees,
jack Heinen relief-pitched Stan
ford's baseballers to a 7 to 6 win
over St. Mary's and right into
first place in the CIBA at Moraga
yesterday.
r J he lead changed hands as many
>rnes as u Ilea changes dog's in a clog
right, arid the game wasn't definitely
decided until Heinen sent Jack
Buckowatz, the last batter, down
'.winging.
Ei;*ht-Inning Climax
St. Mary's half ol' the eighth inning
was the climax of the game. Dave
•St.nll, who had relieved the wobbling
Joe Che/ the inning before, started
lite inning by giving up walks to
h-adoff batter Gene Klingler and
Buckowatz; he then intentionally
passed Tom Nerad to load the bases.
When Stott pitched a ball to the next
hitter, cleanup batter Don Peralta,
Coach Everett Dean waved Heinen in
from the bull pen. Heinen had been
limping badly from a cut on the foot
only a few days before, and it wasn't
certain how his foot would hold up
when hearing down for a pitch.
Ho dispelled any doubts about his
physical condition, however, as he got
the dangerous Peralta to ground out,
first to home. Stanford's answer to
Joe Page then forced the next two
batters to My out feebly to the infield.
Tie-Breaker
The tie-breaker came in the sev
t nth inning with two away. With the
score (i to G, co-captain Dave Melton
looped a Texas-leaguer into center
and then stole second. Melton scored
the clincher a moment later when
Dick Clegg slashed a single past
short.
St. Mary's drew first blood in the
lij'st as Chez fed four balls to Klingler
and gave up a single to Buckowatz.
Both completed the cycle when Bob
Dallas hit a liner over second.
The Cards grabbed a 3 to 2 lead in
their half of the third as catcher Bill
Jlenon and third sacker Bruce Cam
•-ron provoked walks from St. Mary's
'linger, Jack Pickert. Co-captain
Charlie Cole, a real star yesterday,
macked both in with a triple into
deep right field. Cole wandered home
on Buddv Klein's one-baser past
.short.
The Gaels made it 5 to 3 in their
half of the third as Nerad got life
on Tom Shaw's error. Kling singled,
but was tagged out on Dallas' infield

roller. Pete Estrada's automatic dou
ble in the left field cow pastures
knocked both runners home. Catcher
Vince Pisani then boomed a double
into the same place to counter Es
trada.
Indians Even Count
The Indians evened the count in
the fourth as Jim Trabucco and Shaw
teased walks from Pickert. Herron,
the best bunter on the team, sacri
ficed them down the road, and Cam
eron sent them both across the plate
with a double to right.
The see-sawing continued in the
bottom of the fourth as Klingler
rapped a home run into right field
to send the Gaels ahead, (J to 5. It
was the last time the men from Mo
raga were to feel the plush of home
plate.
The fifth inning saw the men of
Everett Dean and Dutch Fehring
tying the game. Left fielder Klein
slashed a single past second to open
the inning. The ex-fullback ad
vanced to third when Clegg hit a
wind-blown double that shortstop
Buckowatz challenged but fell all
over himself trying to snag. The tying
run was scored in dramatic fashion as
Klein stole home.
Chez wasn't his usual imperturb
able self, but stayed in the game long
enough to gain his fourth league vic
tory against no defeats.
Another Close One
The Cards once again evidenced
their liking for close games in the
7 to G victory. It marked the sixth
time in eight league contests that

Stanford has won or lost by one run.
The league leaders face their next
CIBA opponent on Saturday at the
Sunken Diamond when they lock
horns with UCLA.

JACK HEINEN


CHARLIE COLE
In one of those games one
reads about but seldom sees,
jack Heinen relief-pitched Stan
ford's baseballers to a 7 to 6 win
over St. Mary's and right into
first place in the CIBA at Moraga
yesterday.
r J he lead changed hands as many
>rnes as u Ilea changes dog's in a clog
right, arid the game wasn't definitely
decided until Heinen sent Jack
Buckowatz, the last batter, down
'.winging.
Ei;*ht-Inning Climax
St. Mary's half ol' the eighth inning
was the climax of the game. Dave
•St.nll, who had relieved the wobbling
Joe Che/ the inning before, started
lite inning by giving up walks to
h-adoff batter Gene Klingler and
Buckowatz; he then intentionally
passed Tom Nerad to load the bases.
When Stott pitched a ball to the next
hitter, cleanup batter Don Peralta,
Coach Everett Dean waved Heinen in
from the bull pen. Heinen had been
limping badly from a cut on the foot
only a few days before, and it wasn't
certain how his foot would hold up
when hearing down for a pitch.
Ho dispelled any doubts about his
physical condition, however, as he got
the dangerous Peralta to ground out,
first to home. Stanford's answer to
Joe Page then forced the next two
batters to My out feebly to the infield.
Tie-Breaker
The tie-breaker came in the sev
t nth inning with two away. With the
score (i to G, co-captain Dave Melton
looped a Texas-leaguer into center
and then stole second. Melton scored
the clincher a moment later when
Dick Clegg slashed a single past
short.
St. Mary's drew first blood in the
lij'st as Chez fed four balls to Klingler
and gave up a single to Buckowatz.
Both completed the cycle when Bob
Dallas hit a liner over second.
The Cards grabbed a 3 to 2 lead in
their half of the third as catcher Bill
Jlenon and third sacker Bruce Cam
•-ron provoked walks from St. Mary's
'linger, Jack Pickert. Co-captain
Charlie Cole, a real star yesterday,
macked both in with a triple into
deep right field. Cole wandered home
on Buddv Klein's one-baser past
.short.
The Gaels made it 5 to 3 in their
half of the third as Nerad got life
on Tom Shaw's error. Kling singled,
but was tagged out on Dallas' infield

roller. Pete Estrada's automatic dou
ble in the left field cow pastures
knocked both runners home. Catcher
Vince Pisani then boomed a double
into the same place to counter Es
trada.
Indians Even Count
The Indians evened the count in
the fourth as Jim Trabucco and Shaw
teased walks from Pickert. Herron,
the best bunter on the team, sacri
ficed them down the road, and Cam
eron sent them both across the plate
with a double to right.
The see-sawing continued in the
bottom of the fourth as Klingler
rapped a home run into right field
to send the Gaels ahead, (J to 5. It
was the last time the men from Mo
raga were to feel the plush of home
plate.
The fifth inning saw the men of
Everett Dean and Dutch Fehring
tying the game. Left fielder Klein
slashed a single past second to open
the inning. The ex-fullback ad
vanced to third when Clegg hit a
wind-blown double that shortstop
Buckowatz challenged but fell all
over himself trying to snag. The tying
run was scored in dramatic fashion as
Klein stole home.
Chez wasn't his usual imperturb
able self, but stayed in the game long
enough to gain his fourth league vic
tory against no defeats.
Another Close One
The Cards once again evidenced
their liking for close games in the
7 to G victory. It marked the sixth
time in eight league contests that

Stanford has won or lost by one run.
The league leaders face their next
CIBA opponent on Saturday at the

wind-blown double that shortstop
Buckowatz challenged but fell all
over himself trying to snag. The tying
run was scored in dramatic fashion as
Klein stole home.
Chez wasn't his usual imperturb
able self, but stayed in the game long
enough to gain his fourth league vic
tory against no defeats.
Another Close One
The Cards once again evidenced
their liking for close games in the
7 to G victory. It marked the sixth
time in eight league contests that

Stanford has won or lost by one run.
The league leaders face their next
CIBA opponent on Saturday at the
Sunken Diamond when they lock
horns with UCLA.
