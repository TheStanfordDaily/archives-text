### 
Stanford's varsity horsehiders,
fresh from their win over St. Mary's
yesterday afternoon and proud pos
sessors of first place in the CIBA pen
nant chase, meet the University of
California at Santa Barbara College
in the Sunken Diamond this after
noon.
The Indians will be out to avenge
a 4 to 0 shutout administered by the
Gauchos in Santa Barbara earlier in
the season. The Cards would also
like to pin the Gauchos' ears back
because it was in the game at Santa
Barbara that catcher Jim Castagnoli's
shoulder was reinjUrcd.

KZSU will broadcast today's
baseball game between Stanford
and Santa Barbara beginning at .'Â»
p.m. Tom Glikbarg and Jack
Lawrence will give the play-by
play description.

Santa Barbara will probably start
their classy southpaw. Bob Johnson,
on the mound. It was Johnson, who
shut out the Indians, while giving up
eight scattered hits.
Stanford Coach Everett Dean has
not yet announced his starting pitcher
1 for this afternoon's game. However,
;it will probably be either Roger
Osenbaugh or Ed Shive.
