# Card Mermen in Tough Meet With COP Friday
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
In their meet with College of Pa
cific Friday afternoon, Stanford's
swimming team wiil face one of the
! strongest teams they will meet all
season, not excluding the USC Tro
jans.
Tom Haynie got an item of good
news yesterday when it was learned
that Pete Cole, in a brilliant come
through performance, decisioned the
Western Civ final Monday, register
ing a B-minus. With Cole, the
chances of beating Rich Cullenward
1 in both the 220 and 440 are greatly
increased. Haynie will probably
swim Cole in both races and keep
Ernie Polte out of the 220.
Polte Given Chance
Polte must he given an outside
| chance to win against Pacific's Jon
Stebbins, as Stebbins will swim 100
yards in the Medley relay. Steb
! bins has done 2:22 for the 200 breast
j stroke several times this year, and
Polte did a 2:24.!) the week before
the NCAA meet. Polte will also swim
in the freestyle relay, which Stan
ford should win easily.
One of the best races of the day
will be the 150 backstroke, in which
Jack Weeden and Bruce Putnam
from Stanford and Frank Poucher
from COP will vie. Poucher beat
Weeden at the Southern California
AAU meet at Beverly Hills earlier in
the year, both in the 150 and in the
100 yards which start off a Medley
relay. Poucher and Weeden have
been doing around 1:37.5, while Put
nam. swimming by himself, turned in
! a 1:39 last week in practice.
Fast Sprint Race
The 50-yard freestyle race is espe
cially hard to dope for this meet, as
there are three of the four sprinters
who have been doing 24.0 or better,
and a slow start or missed turn could
easily mean the race. Pacific's Willie
'Steele is good lor 24.0, and he is
' tough to beat in his own pool, where
he knows how to swim his best in the
warm water and the strange (to the
Indians) turns. However, Bob Wy
coff, Rod Mead, and Chuck Kelly
! have been red hot in their sprinting
1 all week. Mead and Kelly swam 23. i
each for 50 yards Monday, and Wy
cofi did 23.8 Tuesday.
The meet, which will be held in
Stockton, is being given top play
j among Pacific's weekend sporting
j events and will ,draw a large crowd.
The meet will be of special interest
j to Fred Cady, USC coach, because
the Cardinals are traveling South a
week from this Saturday to take on
the Trojans and UCLA.
Saturday morning, Stanford's var

sity will host the Olympic Club in
the Encina Pools. Feature attractions
will be the distance races, in which
Cole, who did 4:45 for a quarter last
week, will meet Sammy Lee.
