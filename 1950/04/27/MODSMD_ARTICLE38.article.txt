# Crew Spirit High After Trojan Win
## 
### 
Fresh from their victory over
USC last week, the varsity crew is
now busy preparing for what may
be their toughest race of the year,
when they take on Cal in the Oak
land Estuary May (5. One of four
practice three-mile time trials has
been run, with Coach Jim Beggs
planning to complete the series ear
ly next week.
Beggs has been drilling his crew
men on smooth slide work, having
expressed some concern over the
jerky form displayed against South
ern California last weekend.
Spirit is high among the oarsmen,
partly over the past weekend's suc
cess. but mostly in eager anticipa
tion of the test coming up in their
race with UC's national champions.
The Card crew holds high hopes
of again going to the national races,
being held this year at Marietta,
Ohio. If they can win over the UC
veterans on May (5, there's more
than a small chance for them to
bring home the coveted national
title.
The varsity's first home appear
ance will come May 13, when they
will give USC a second try at the
Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.
