# Underdog Bruins Ready For Stanford Cinder Test
## 
### 
Hit severely by graduation last
year, Coach Ducky Drake's young
but game Bruin track team v/ill in
vade Stanford Stadium Saturday
with high hopes of making a strong
showing against Stanford's potent
; cinder squad.
Drake has lost most of his top
j stars, including PCC hurdle champ
Dixon, PCC discus champion Taylor
Lewis, PCC high jump champion
j George Stanieh, and star sprinter
Bob Work. The Bruins lost to Stan
ford last year, 74 to 57, in West
| wood.
UCLA Started out the 1050 season
by bowling over San Diego State,
Cal Poly, and Santa Barbara, but
were soundly thumped by Cal, 101
to 30, two Saturdays ago.
Cy Young, ace Bruin javelin
thrower, may push NCAA cham
pion Bud Held to a new record Sat
urday. The UCLA star, who is con
sidered one of the best spear throw
ers in the country, headed the jav
; elin 221 ft. 3 ;| t in. in the triangular
meet with Santa Barbara and Cal
: Poly on April 1.
| The Bi'uins have strong half-mil
i ers in Captain Jack Miller and
Hugh Mitchell. Miller has a respec-
I table 1:54.8 to his credit, while
1 Mitchell has been timed at 1:58.3.
The discus is another UCLA
j stronghold. Dave Williams has
j thrown the platter 154 feet this year
and teammate Ron Drummond has
hit 14(1 It. 4 l > in. A Bruin one-two
in this event is very possible.
The closest event of the day may
be the pole vault with Bruins Roy

I Vujovich and Andy Berekoff, both
of whom have cleared 13 feet, vy
ing with Stanford's Don Campbell
for first-place honors.
Sprinter Bob Watanbe, with a .8
hundred to his credit, might n'vt*
the Card sprinters a rough after
j noon. Teammate Bob Wilkinson lias
run 10.1 and 23.0 this season.
The rest of the Bruin team is
i comparatively weak, and Drake
faces a touj,'h rebuilding job.
