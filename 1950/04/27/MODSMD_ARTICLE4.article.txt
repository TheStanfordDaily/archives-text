# Slot Machines Illegal
## 
### 
SACRAMENTOâ€”Two bills aimed
at driving the slot machine racket,
out of California were signed into
law today by Governor Warren.
After they go into effect July 15
it will be illegal to own or operate
slot machines in the state.
The measures were passed by the
special session of the Legislature to
strengthen the present law. That
statute prohibits operation of the
devices for gambling. But to get, a
conviction it has been necessary to
prove the machines were paying off.
The new laws ban "mere posses
sion."
