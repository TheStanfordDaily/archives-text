# First King-Queen Contest Since 1936 to Boost Con Home Week
## 
### GORDON McKIBBEN 
The last king and queen contest
in 1936 brought to a 14-year halt
the exciting, if ill-fated, escapades
of a custom which highlighted by
gone Con Home Weeks.
Excom and the administration
are keeping a watchful eye on the
contest revival tins year, remem
bering earlier years in the mid
thirties when the royal voting
reeled dizzily on:
1934 —The beautiful queen of the
Masque Ball is held captive and
blindfolded for 13 hours, sorority
telephone wires are tapped by po
lice, and FBI men swarm over the
campus.
Said the administration and stu
dent leaders, "Things will calm
down next year."
1935—A queen candidate liires a
plane to do sky-writing for her.
sororities and dormitories are pitted
against each other in an atmosphere
of frigid dislike.
Said the administration, "There
dent leaders, "Next year will see a
saner attitude toward the contest."
1936 —An elephant parades around
Quad garbed in purple robes; $100
bills are plunked down before bal
lot counters faster than at a Reno
dice table. Over $4,000 is raised.
Said the administration and stu
dent leaders, "Next year will see a
saner attitude toward the contest."
The royal battle this year will
again decide the Masque Ball rul
ers. "But don't forget it's on a trial
basis," cautions Downing McKee,
Con Home drive chairman.
"Cardinals feels that the contest
can be a good money-raiser and an
interesting event. However, we are
strictly controlling the campaign
this year. "We don't want another
1934-36 orgy," he remarked.
Cardinals' concern about the ear
lier voting is understandable.
In the kidnap case, for instance,
the University spent about $500 in
one afternoon trying to find the ab
ducted girl.
The kidnapping occurred when a
fake photographer tossed a blanket
over the queen's head and tossed
her into his black sedan. She was
blindfolded and held for 13 hours.
Police tapped the wires at her so
rority house. The FBI, jumpy at
the very mention of kidnapping,
sent several men to the campus.
However, the queen was released
none the worse for her experience
in the early evening near the Ryan
High Voltage Laboratory. She

thought it was just a prank, and
added that a San Francisco news
paper had interviewed her at the
hideout. However, the newspaper
refused to tell the University how
it found out where she was.
Acting President Edgar E. Rob
inson promised "drastic disciplinary
action." Men's Council vowed to
"get to the bottom of this." But ap
parently the case was never solved.
A political trick turned up to sour
the 1935 campaign. Just five min
utes before the contest ended, a girl
from Lagunita was leading the top
sorority candidate. At this point, all
the other sorority women withdrew,
giving their ballots to their Row
sister, who thus won.
In 1936, an elephant enlivened the
early campaigning, and the Dionne
quintuplets were officially entered.
But money was the real trouble

maker. During the last 20 minutes
; of voting, nine $100 bills and several
fifties were paid out. The winning
queen had over $900. Altogether, in
terms of penny ballots, 400,654 pen
nies were spent.


MADY AND MICHAEL take a turn at being king and queen, in
make-believe, anyway, as their big brothers and sisters on cam
pus continue balloting for the royal couple of Con Home Week.
All proceeds from the contest, which is being revived after 14
years, will go to convalescing children at the Home.
