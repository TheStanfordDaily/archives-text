# Excom Turns Down NSA Affiliation Again
## Murphy Submits Hashing Report 
### 
NSA's straw in the wind was
blown away foi good last, night as
Excom voted, 8 vo 3, against ac
cepting National Student Associa
tion affiliation next year on a budg
et of $385.
The decision came after the stu
dent representatives heard NSA
Regional President Diek Kelton
enumerate the benefits of national
affiliation.
The views of Student Manager
John Lilienthal spotlighted the op
position on budget matters. Lilien
thal objected to affiliation on the
grounds that NSA's request had
been considered in relation to the
money requests of other commit
tees. He said Excom had decided
that the students did not receive the
maximum benefit of their dollar by
belonging to NSA.
Lilienthal's arguments were pre
sented in his absence by Student
Manager-elect Dave Elliott,
Kcltun's Points
Kelton outlined NSA's work on
the international, national, and re
gional levels and pointed to in
stances where Stanford groups had
benefited from NSA-poolcd infor
mation.
Following the final decision to
drop NSA, Excom approved a let
ter of disaffiliation to the national
office. ASSU President Hank Rosin
1 said that Excom next week would
consider plans for a local organi
zation to take over NSA's functions
wherever necessary.
NSA's only recourse to reafiilia
tion is to obtain recognition from
some future Executive Committee,
Rosin said.
Hashing Report
Stanford's hashing system was
given a clean slate by Excom mem
ber Mike Murphy, who reported
that his special committee could
find no organized complaint against
the system.
Murphy said that steps to put the
choosing of hashers on a fairer basis
had already been taken. Hashers
arc now interviewed by the student
j counseling offices, thus corrccting
I the chief complaint heard against
j the system, he said.
Murphy said that Excom should
recommend to future Executive
Committees that a hashing commit
tee be set up each year to keep the
director of dining halls posted on
student opinion about hashing. Ex
com approved.
Election Chairman Cliff Carlscn
answered a complaint from Marv
Tincher to the effect that there was
no rccord kept of ballot numbers
and the numbers were not torn off
at the booth, thus opening the way
to possible counterfeiting or tracing
of 'i personal vote.
Carlscn said that the numbers
wore for distribution purposes only
| and that Election Board kept an
j accurate count on the numbers of
I ballots at each poll and the num
-1 her of people voting at the same
booth. He added that students were
not assigned ballot numbers at the
polls.
Excom also:
1. Approved 5135 for the instal
lation of posts for overhead signs
I outside the Union.
2. Endorsed the request of lIR to
| the Committee 011 Public Exerciscs
that classes be dismissed tomorrow
afternoon so that students can at
tend the UN Model Assembly.
3. Tabled a by-law which would
I make candidates who defaced The
| Daily subject lo disqualification.
4. Approved the Athletic Com
mittee as a standing ASSU commit
! tee,
3. Approved the new Activities
Board as a recommending body on
social program and policy. A re
