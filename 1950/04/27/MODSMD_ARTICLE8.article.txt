### 
Ten million Californians will set their clocks ahead an hour Satur
day al midnight when the state switches to Daylight Saving Time. Hut
as far as Women's Council is concerned, the change won't happen until
after 2:30 a.m. (Pacific Standard Time).
Women who take I:3ft's that night will return to their residences al
1:30 Standard Time. The same procedure will apply for 2:3o's, accord
ing to Mimi Lew is, member of Council.
By the time all the Californians gain hack their 60 minutes of sleep the
night of September 23, they will have had, collectively, 1.170,000 more
hours of sunshine. That's quite a lot of sunshine, even in California.
Rut that's what a lot of people of the state voted for last November.
Clock changes are never without confusion. Californians will find out
Saturday. For example:
All Southern Pacific trains are going to run on Daylight Saving Time,
but Santa Fe trains arc going to arrive and depart on Standard Time.
