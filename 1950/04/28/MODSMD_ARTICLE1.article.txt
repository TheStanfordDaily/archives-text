## Hoover Calls for UN Minus Red Countries 
### 
NEW YORK, April 27 (/l>)â€” Her
bert Hoover called tonight for
scrapping of the present United Na
tions organization and tho setting
up of a new one with the Com
munist countries shut out.
The former President said the
need is great for a dynamic "new
united front" against "creeping Red
imperialism."
This country, Hoover declared, is
becoming "more and more isolated
as the sole contender in this cold
war," and is "steadily losing
ground" to Russia and her allies.
Hoover's address was delivered
before the American Newspaper
Publishers' Association at a banquet
ending the A.N.P.A. annual conven
tion in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
First cautious reaction at the
United Nations and in Washington
to Hoover's proposal was either in
opposition or non-committal.
