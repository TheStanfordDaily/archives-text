## 
### 
A student who said he memorized
passages from a biology text for six
hours a day over a two-month period
was acquitted last week of charges
that he cheated 011 a final exam.
Appearing before Men's and Wom
en's Councils, the student told how
he had been out of school five quar
ters, awaiting an opportunity to make
up an incomplete in a biology course.
"1 realized that I had to earn a
high grade in order to get back into
Stanford, since 112 was minus in sev
eral other courses," he explained to
the joint council.
"I worked an average of six hours
per day from early January until
winter quarter finals memorizing the
points I thought most important," he
testifier).
The Councils' decisions was unani
mous. All members agreed that there
was no evidence that could permit
anything other than acquittal. The
student's obvious familiarity with
the material was also noted.
The case was brought before the
Councils when the professor of the
course, also the author of the text
used, noted startling similarities be
tween answers and the book. The re
semblance amounted almost to a
word-for-word repeat of para
graphs in the book.
