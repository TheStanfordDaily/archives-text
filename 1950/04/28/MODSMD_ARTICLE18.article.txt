hood play lot.
There's a new feature this year. !
too Ilopalong Cassidy and other
shows nightly on the television set
which supplement the onco-a-weck
movie. Occasional tea parties in the |
jaunty little playhouse, which is
complete right down to a real fire- !
place and workable stove, and days
on the playground and in the tree
house are part of the many activi
ties which make the place "home"
to the kiris.
Combating pains of homesickness j
is as much a part of the staff's job
as is curing the little patients of 1
rheumatic fever. Even before they]
come to the Home the children be- (
come acquainted with it by pictures j
and stories given them by social j
workers.
Children come into the home in
groups. This provides an opportu
nity for them to get acquainted with
each other and removes some of the !
initial strangeness of moving to a
new place.
Children Placed in Units
According to bow advanced their
convalescence is, they are placed in
the bed unit or the "runabout" unit.
"Runabouts" are usually children in
the last stage of convalescence and i
can participate in regular play.
Sincc the children admitted are
four to 12 years old, school is a |
necessary part of life at the Con i
Home. Four hours a day teachers |
conduct bedside classes, stressing'
individual attention, From time to 1

time, urade cards are issued.
Kven thr accompanying activities!
of school life Brownies and Cubs I
-can be found at I lie Con Home. |
Tbe.se groups are sponsored by the [
Senior Auxiliary of the Con Home |
and the Optimist Club.
Sunday School Held
Weekly Sunday school is held, I
but it is non-denominational since
the cbi'dren are of all religions,
races, and creeds.
The children bave periods of nor
mal play every day. The bed pa
tients enjoy playing "house," dress
ing up in grown - U|> clothes, and j
visiting each other's beds.
The "runabouts" arc free to play
out'ide and seem no different from |
Ibe uany on, the block at borne, ex- !
cepl that they are closely super- j
vised. Their playground includes i
swings, slides, treebousc, and sand
box.
Picnics for Kiddies
On Tuesdays there are picnic j
suppers including potato chips, I
which are the best part, according
to the cbi'dren. On Saturdays, they [
may put on plays, magic shows, cir- j
euscs, or bold a cowboy roundup.
Holidays arc always observed,
ami Santa Clans is a regular part
of l)ie Christmas celebration. Sam
McDonald's birthday is a special j
event, and the children insist on
Hiving him a party every year. Sam i
is the bandy man at the Home and !
has always prepared the all-campus |
barbecue.
Once a week it's "write home" ;
time. And somewhere in every let - >
ter there's apt to be the line, "It's
fun here." The Con Home keeps its ]
1 charges not only well but happy.


CLASSROOM COMES to the bed ward at the Con Home, which has regular school lor the chil
dren. Jackie, who looks overcome with a little lecture drowsiness right now, Lena and Lorry are
shown struggling through one of those stiff assignments which have a habit of popping up all
over the Farm. All children at the Home are between the ages of 4 and 12. Those who attend
school also get the perennial report card. —photo by Howard Garnick
