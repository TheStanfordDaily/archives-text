# The
						UN Comes to Yon
## 
### 
Since time beq.ui "The Future" has been a
< hiel topic of discussion by all peoples.
In tins postwar period, .is perhaps never be
fore in the course of history, our discussions
Oil this topic revolve around a single organiza
tion; out hopes and fears for the future of civ
ilization, of the United States, and ourselves,
t.ike us inevitably to consideration of lhe
United Nations.
True, there are many plans and theoiies de
signed to attain the goal of World Peace. But
the only concrete, functioning group actually
•xisiing on the international level is the UN.
The question "Is the United Nations the
:iiiiest way to World Peace" is a highly contro
versial one. The UN has, many of us believe,
made progiess toward this goal, and shows
every promise of greater accomplishments.
On the other hand, it has received much criti
cism.
This much is sure; even if the UN is not the
best way to World Peace the best way will be
found only through the lessons we are learning
from the UN's work.
It would seem logical to us then, if we are
concerned with the future, to observe the UN
with the greatest attention. We should study
its organization and method of operation, so
that we may better evaluate it in relation to
the final goal which we all seek . . . Peace.
Today we will have an opportunity, thanks
t«j Stanford's Institute of International Rela
tions, to observe a mock UN Assembly, con
ducted by Stanford students, debate four pro
posals for international control of atomic en
orgy.
The students have studied the UN Assem
bly's method of operation and will follow it to
the last detail. They will be advised, in many
cases, by representatives from the consulates
oi the nations they "represent." Tbe Assembly
will be moderated by Dr. Antoine Goldet, prin

cipal director of the UN Department of Eco
nomic Affairs
Every Stanford student can benefit by at
tending the Assembly this afternoon, and Dr.
Goldet's address at 7:30 this evening, in Me
morial Auditorium.
Stanford's model Assembly is recognized
internationally as a project of great value, as
evidenced by the words ol encouragement and
praise received from Benjamin Cohen, assist
ant secretary general of the UN; Warren Aus
tin, chairman of the United States UN delega
tion; James Shotwell, of the Carnegie Endow
ment for International Peace; and Eleanor
Roosevelt.
To demonstrate the tenor of this encourage
ment, we offer the following telegram re
ceived here yesterday from Charles Malik, of
the UN Third Committee on Social, Humani
tarian, and Cultural Affairs:
"In opening this year's model General As
sembly, please convey to the Assembly the fol
lowing meassaqe irom me as a former Assem
bly president. Every effort must be mobilized
now in the interest oI peace. Great tensions
and problem persist but one should never give
up in this eternal struggle for peace, justice,
and truth. Am confident this year's model Gen
eral Assembly will mark another milestone in
the creation of an enlightened climate of opin
ion for the sake of peace. May the issues be
thoroughly debated and discussed in an at
mosphere of mutual forbearance and trust.
"The youth of America have today perhaps
greater responsibility than any other youth.
On their comprehension, depth of feeling, gen
uine desire for justice and peace, and burning
enthusiasm for world issues the future pri
manly depends. May God give them all power
to shoulder the challenges and responsibilities
ol the moment."
