One evening a young lady walked into a fashionable
r.ight club with a young man. She walked just two
tepii ahead of the young man and kept an expression
less face. She sat. down and placed one hand into the
other and turned her profile up for view. She laughed
when the young man said something funny, looked
• •-i-ioiis when he said something serious, and looked
bored when he said nothing at all. Soon she saw a
!riend ol hers sitting at a nearby table. She went over
to hf*i I riend. She talked about acquaintances. Then
he talked about clothes. Then she talked about ac
quaintances. While casually glancing around the room,
■ he noticed that her date looked glum. She went back
to him. He asked her to dance. She danced with him.
She was a college woman.
One afternoon a young lady walked out of the cam
pus Host OHice. She waj. dressed in the latest fashion.
She looked like Mrs. Roosevelt must have looked
wlu 11 . i he was a young yitl. This young lady walked
down the street without noticing anyont She was a
Sfairiord woman.
A young man and girl were driving along one night.
'I l.e 'young man stopped the car in a secluded place.
The young woman's face turned from an expression
of assumed calmness to one of wonder. The young man
put his arm around tlit young woman's waist and drew
her toward him. She looked frightened and pulled
away. The young man looked disappointed. Me started

up the car and drove away. She was .1 Ifesluuan
woman.
A class had just ended. A young lady walked out
of a building. She wore something on her sweater that
glittered. She stopped a moment and looked about
her. She noticed a group of young men standing to
her left. She carefully gathered her books in her arm
and walked toward the young men. As she neared
them, she lifted her chin and walked right through the
group of young men. She was a Stanford woman who
was pinned.
A young woman stood on the Engineei ing Corner of
the Quad. She looked al.out her as if expecting a
Iriend. She looked at her watch and waited. She
looked down toward the History Corner and then she
looked up toward the Union. No one arrived. Her
head moved in a gesture of impatience. She looked at
her watch again and then walked to the Union. There
she found some friends. They had coffee together.
Standing with the coffee in her hand, she smiled at
people she knew and coldly ignored the others. When
ever a handsome man came by, she looked at him
with a half-smile and then she made the expression
vanish from her lace. One by one, her friends began
to leave. She looked at the cup in her hand. The cof
lee was almost gone. She asked a friend which way
she was going. The two of them walked away She
was a Stanford woman who was not pinned.
