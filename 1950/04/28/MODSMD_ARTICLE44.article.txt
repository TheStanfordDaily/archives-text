# Gleaming, $950,000 Law School Rises Within Familiar Sandstone
## 
### 
Out, of the shell of the old Stanford :
Administration Building — outdated, j
liini/y. and inadequate — the San
Francisco firm of Wagner and Mar
tinez has constructed a gleaming new
home for the Stanford School of
Law, "probably the most attractive j
and comfortable law school in the
country."
In this recently-completed $950,000
building, say Law School officials, the
school can operate more efficiently !
than ever before in its 57-year his- j
tor j-.
In place of three small, over- [
crowded buildings on the Inner i

Quad, the professors and budding [
lawyers now have ample space in a
.structure built around their needs.
Wheels Turn In '4X
The reconstruction job began in the !
fall of 11)48. Down went the stained I
glass windows, the skylight above the |
high lobby, the circular marble stair- ;
cases, the small mezzanine that gave j
the building only one and a hall i
floors. In their place, within the
familiar sandstone walls, rose a func- j
tional, modern five-story structure, j
Architects were Weihe, Flick, and !
Kruse of San Francisco.
Professors began to move into the i

| new building in February of this
! year. The realistic moot court room
! saw action last quarter, and classes
commenced there this quarter.
Modern Methods, Materials
The latest materials and methods
j of construction are used throughout,

nounced.
