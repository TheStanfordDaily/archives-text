# Lawyers Strive to 'Best Cal' At Semi-annual Bar Exam
## 
### 
On the* athletic field, the impas
sioned words, "Beat Cal are sine qua
nons to rivalry-minded Stanford
rooters. Yet, believe it or not, in still
another field, this immortal epithet
has found its place.
Every year come April and October
an aggregation tact-laden Stan
ford grads, bleary-eyed from three
years' hard work on their own "prac
tice field." turn out to uphold the
laurels of the Stanford Law School.
With students from California's 15
other law schools, of which the Uni
versity of California alone has of
fered close competition in the last IN
years, the Stanford*; take the semi
annual State Bar examination.
Last April (the results of this
month's exam have not yet been de
termined) !)1 per cent of the Farm
lawyers taking the lest passed with
flying colors. A complete victory re
sulted as Stanford polled a higher
percentage than any of her competi
tors.
In October 1949, bar records show
;i slight drop in Stanford's standings,
.is the legal Indians dropped two
points below the Colifornians' per
centage.

Over the years, however, as chief
mentor Dean Carl Spaeth of the L;iw
School is quick to point out, Stanford
has maintained the highest average
in the state, 87.0 per cent for the
period 1932 to 1948. Cal stands a close
second with some 85 per cent passing
during the same period. Stanford's
current three-year average i.s even
more promising, hitting 89.0 per
cent.
When asked about the percentage
outlook lor the future at Stanford,
Dean Spaeth predicted "(he average
will stay about the same -around 89
or 90 per cent passing each year."
According trÂ» the standards set up
by the State Bar, a law school must
show over a three-year period that
at least HO per cent of its,students
graduates and non-graduates alike
who have taken the Bar Exam have
passed it.
Stanford, Cal, and USC, the three
top schools, all lie between 80 and 90
per cent for the current period. As a
result, "Boat Cat" becomes ;i very
real .sentiment to compelil ion
minded faculty and ulumni on the
Farm.
