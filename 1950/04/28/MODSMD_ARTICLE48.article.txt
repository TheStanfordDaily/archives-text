# The 						Law School Builds,
## $250,000 Donated By Alums, Friends 
### 
If would have cost over twice as much to erect a new building
for the Stanford Law School as it did to remodel the old Adrninis
tration Building, according to Edlridge T. Spencer, University di
rector of planning.
Approximate cost of the completed reconstruction job is $950,

1 !H)0. Spencer guotssed that it would*
i have cost bet wren $2,250,000 and
i $2,500,000 to have constructed a new
! building, with similar facilities, as
i Had previously been planned.
The construction job was financed
partly, through a drive lor funds, be
j gun in IM4:>, which brought in $250,
000 from '"friends and alumni of the
[Law School." The remaining cost, |
> nearly $750,000, has been shouldered
j by the University.

The original contract was made in
July of 1!)48 with the San Francisco
I firm of Wagner and Martinez for j
$783,000. "We absorbed about $30,000 1
I in change-overs alter that," said a j
I spokesman for the company, "so Ihe |
University paid no more than Ihe j
original contract stipulated."
On top of that went furniture costs, j
architects' fees, inspection fees, and
j payments for such things as installa
: lion of a lire alarm system.
The fund-raising campaign that re- '
suited in the new building began in j
December 1945. In a publicity bro
j chure, Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, then
; president, of the University, stated ;
• that "alumni, through the Stanford :
1 Law Societies, have voluntarily come
i forward to initiate a program for the :
support of the Stanford Law School." j

The program was known as the
' Stanford Law School Plan, and was J
| headed by Charles A. Beardsley oi
J Oakland. While the plan was ini
j tiated by the alumni, said Dr. Tresid- j
1 dor, its formulation had become a '
joint effort of alumni, Law School j
' faculty, and administration.
The short-range goal was set at :
$750,000, only $350,000 of which was !
intended for the new building. The !
program sought $250,000 to bring j
more professors to the school. To ex
pand the library, $50,000 was asked. !
| Aii increase of $100,000 in scholar- |
! ships was needed.
"Normal Development" J
A long-range goal of $4,000,000 was
! announced to provide for the "nor- 1
mal development of the school as to j
faculty, equipment, library, and stu
i dents, as now estimated." This money
was to be gathered through gifts, be
| quests, and endowments.
Funds began to roll in. By May
194G, $103.1(>0 had been subscribed.
Judge George E. Crothers of San
Francisco had donated an additional
$125,000 for a law dormitory.
The $783,000 contract made in 1948
| was far above the original estimate,
but the fund-raising campaign con
tinued.
Gifts Since September
From September to the first of this
month. $108,000 has been donated,
said Dean Carl B. Spaeth. '"This sum
includes in excess of $20,000 from i
alumni of the Law School," he elabo

Fifty thousand dollars, from the ;
estate of William Nelson Cromwell, |
was applied to the Cromwell Chair j
of Law, set up last year. There- i
