Today The Daily presents a special Law School edition. In the 1
preparation of this edition we have been guided by two central
theses.
1. The new physical plant for Stanford's Law School, certainly
one of the finest in the United Siater. if not the world, is the mag- i
nificent result of over 45 years of planning and fund-raising.
i Through the years the goal, now realized, has been to provide
1 facilities and environment superbly tailored io fit the study of law.
2. While the physical pilant of the school plays an important
role in providing such an environment, far more important is the
| spirit of the study.
This spirit is overwhelmingly evident in the devotion of a su
perior law school faculty . . . devotion to progress through bet
| ter teaching methods and better physical facilities for the teaching.
And the spirit is intrinsic in the generosity of those who gave
money to make such progress possible, to mold ideals into reali
ties such as scholarships and the new law building.
This spirit is a part of the interest, on the part of students, alumni,
faculty, and friends of the University, in making Stanford a better j
place of learning. And it is a part of the broader realization, to
guote Dr. Sterling, that:
"Today . . . the lawyer's role in society is more important than
ever. Complexities of our modern times have created for law
yers new tasks, new responsibilities, and new opportunities. Le- >
