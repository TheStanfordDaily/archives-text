The story is not over. Although an imposing, $950,000 buildin
to house the Stanford School of Law was completed two month
ago, plans for further development of the school are rolliiuj o
unabated.

Scholarships Low
I "The scholarship problem is hi
coming more and more acute," sa
i Dr. James E. Brenner, professor
law and secretary of the Law Scho
j Plan.
To hi ing top students who la<
I financial means into the school, tl
lawyers are operating on a $17,0
j scholarship program this year. Bi
las Professor Brenner pointed ot
more grants are needed to combat tl
I diflerential between Stanford's tu

I Another source of competitii

I This year the school brought Dr. Sy

i tion,
The new William Nelson Cromwi
chair of law, drawing a yearly i>
come of $12,000 from a $250,000 i
vestment, stands as the first and on
endowed professorship in the Li
School, It i.s held by Dr. Marion Ri
Kirkwood, Dean of the school fro
j 1923 to 1945.
"Other schools have seven or eig
of these," commented Dean Carl
: Spaeth. "We could easily use two
j three more."
New Books Needed
Sixty thousand volumes wei;
; down the shining new Law Sehc
; stacks, but there is space for 190,0
more. Money is needed to expai
' the library and to pay for curre
j subscriptions.
"There has been a substantial i
■ crease in appropriations from t
i University in recent years," said I
Brenner, "but it is just enough to p
for the increasing costs of subscri
tions."
As part of the Law School Plan,
i alumni of the school receive an a
nual appeal for funds from the Sch<
i of Law and not from the Univers
! as a whole.
(*oals Remain
"The goals set up in 194(5 have
j changed," Dean Spaeth said. "But i
1 stead of shooting for bulk total,
i ;:re now aiming for annual gifts
about $50,000 a year."
Chairman of the national com. -n
j tee of the plan is Francis V. Keesii
|of San Francisco. Vice-chairman
Francis Price of Santa Barbara. I
| Brenner is the secretary.
