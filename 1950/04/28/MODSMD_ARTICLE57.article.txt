# Predicts Brilliant Future
## Half-Century Dream Sees Fulfillment 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
For longer than most of us
can remember, Stanford's law
yers have dreamt of a new law
school. This year marks the
fruition of thi'.t dream. Today ,
Stanford s 1,900 law students, :
professors, and alums can point
with pride to what is undoubt
edly "one of the finest physical
plants of its kind in the world."
Erection of the new school has not
been an easy task. The comfortable,
green leather armchairs of the new
lounge, the amphitheater-like, solt
toned atmosphere of the modern
classrooms, and the spacious shelves, j
reading rooms, and stacks of the law- i
yel's' library have been won only
alter some 45 years of dreaming, i
planning, and soliciting.
Money a Problem
Money, that old Stanford stumbling
block, has proven the biggest hurdle !
in the path of the legal contingent.
As early as 1904, 11 years after the
founding of the "Stanford Law Dei
partment," Nathan Abbott, first di
rector of the school, saw the need for |
< xpanded facilities.
He had seen the school progress
from two small classrooms in the En
gineering Building and a pint-sized
library in Encina to its location in
Inner Quad, where it occupied the |
building to the east of Memorial
Court.
But in those days of infancy, with
a faculty of five or .six and a student j
body nowhere near its present size,
improvements seemed unnecessarily
costly.
Idea Grows
Later, in 1914, Instructor Marion
Rice Kirkwood, three years a gradu
ate and later Dean of the school for j
22 years, told President Ray Lyman j
Wilbur that under existing conditions
the Law School would need an en
larged plant within two years.
But a lack of funds, so often the
unfortunate lot of the struggling pri
vate university, proved to be an in
surmountable barrier. Recitation
rooms had been moved to the ad
joining building (now the president's
offices) but further expansion and
newer facilities seemed impossible.
In 1924, the "legal eagles" went at
it in earnest. A $500,000 fund-raising
campaign was launched to finance a
proposed two-floor law quadrangle to
be located east of the Main Library.
Elaborate Plans Drawn
An imposing set of architect's plans
calling for club rooms, locker room,
court room, men's smoking room,
class and faculty rooms, and an en- >
larged library was submitted and I
met the hearty approval of its back
ers.
But, as Professor Kirkwood re
members, "There was never any
money; every time we put off the new
school a few more years, construction
costs rose and outdistanced us."
Such was "The Problem of the
Stanford Law School" from its child- I
hood in 1904 to its 50-year-old stature
in 1949. As a result, during the latter
hall of those 50 years, only a part of
the ever-increasing number of law
books could be accommodated in the
undersized library. The existing j
reading room could hold less than
one-lhird the total complement of
the school. Classrooms were inade

quale and too few in number. Fac
ulty oflice space was sorely limited.
Makeshift Existence
Consequently, Looks were stored in
hard-to-get-to basements; classes
were overcrowded; and faculty and
secretary's offices were moved from
one building to the next—always
away from the school itself.
But while the school suffered
physically over the years, it improved
academically in leaps and bounds.
New professors — experts in their
fields- were continually being added
to the faculty roster. While there
were nine professors teaching over
!>(]() students in 15)24, today there is
double that number teaching just
under 400 men. The quality oi in
struction has gone up while the stu
dent body has risen relatively
slightly.
Academic Advances
In 1924, the Stanford Law School
became the first school in the West to
require an A.B. of all its entrants,
stiessing the development, not only
of lawyers per se, but also of men
of "sound and liberal education." In
1901, just eight years after its found
ing, the school had attained accep
tance to the Association of American
Law Schools, proving its place among
the nation's better schools.
Graduates from its classrooms have
become American and State Bar
presidents, Supreme Court judges,
and congressmen. Its professors have
received nationwide recognition in

the forms of articles, awards, and,
I just recently, a $250,000 endowed
I professorship.
More Tliiiii a Plain
j And throughout ail, the cardinal
j aims of the school, "never to sacrifice
quality for quantity," and "always to
: promote the development of the
whole' man," were strictly observed.
As former Dean Kirkwood puts it:
| "We leave the mass production to
the other schools . . . ."
Today, through the untiring ef
forts of hundreds of true "men of
Stanford," the legals enjoy their new
school, their dream come true. But,
more important, they enjoy some
thing else. As Frai.k J. Taylor, then
editor of the Stanford Illustrated Re
view, wrote in 1936:
". . . . (the school) has a unity of
professors and students that cannot
be bought with money. Out of this
has come its outstanding success."


NOT A SCENE from a Hollywood movie, this is a picture of the
realistic new Moot Court room on the Law Building s third floor.
Judge's bench, witness stand, and jury box, al! will make the
law graduate feel at home in the county courthouse.
