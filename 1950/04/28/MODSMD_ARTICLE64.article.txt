# Student, Prof Opinions Vary On New Plant

### 
"What do you think of the new Law
School?" was the question The Daily
' asked three law students and as
many professors earlier this week.
Erstwhile yell leader of the '48-'49
(era. Torn Elke, now a first-year bar- i
i rister, is evidently going to spend !
some time "getting used to the !
school." He reported:
"The classrooms are awfully big— ]
j and you know that lecture hall on
(he first floor—it's almost like being
in a tomb!"
Classrooms Hotter
The second interviewed, third-year i
. student Mort Herzstein, told The i
Daily: "The classrooms are much
j better; the library is probably the
best in the school; and there's lots
, more otfice space for all the Law
School organizations."
Another third-year solicitor, Bob
i Reynolds, onetime writer for the '
Stanford Law Review, communicated
his feelings about the now building
in a 42-word statement, as follows: I
"The new quarters are certainly
more convenient than running from
one corner of the Quad to another for
classes. However, their luxurious
ness does not .seem conducive to sus
tained labor. In fact, you feel more
I like parading in hose and doublet
than working."
Now Puts A Coat On
Much the fame sentiment of for
i inality was expressed by Professor
Lowell Tut renting, onetime ve'»nt« j
! .lean of the school, when he said;
"1 never used to put on my coat
when going for a walk through the
I building; nowadays I'd feel un
-1 diesf-ed without it."
Professor James E. Brenner, sec re- i
lary of the Law School Plan which
helped make the new structure pos
sible. was mure concrete:
"I don't think there is a luw school
anywhere as attractive and comfor
table as ours."
Concluding the interviewing spree,
; Cromwell Endowment Professor
Marion Rice Kirkwood seconded Dr.
Brenner's motion and added, " 1 think
j we've probably got a better deal here
in the remodeled building than a new
building would have ever idven us." ;
