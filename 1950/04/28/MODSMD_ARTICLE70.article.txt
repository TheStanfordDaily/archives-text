# Scholarships Hit $17,000 As Plan Continues
## 
### 
One of the most important pha.--.es
of the Stafford Law School Plan is
its scholarship pro-nam.
In an effort to gain outstanding
students who lack the financial moans
to come to Stanford, the school itself,
the University, and various alumni
members have this year realized $17.-
000 for scholarships.
Approximately $10,000 of this sum
has come from the University in the
j form of grants-in-aid and enteiing
scholarships. This year, three $10.-
000 scholarships and approximately
! seven $000 scholarships were handed
j out from this fund to entering stu
dents.
At the present time, the Law
School itself offers 11 funded schol-
I urships — the annual amounts of
! which are determined by the .size of
the funds endowed and the income;
| received from them.
These scholarships are awarded ti
students already in school and are
| given on a basis of grades and pe
| cuniary need.
| Probably the most interesting—and
I a* yet untapped—source of scholar
ship money is that which comes from
] various law firms in the state.
Members of these firms, who are
Law School alumni, have seen fit to
donate, on a year-to-year basis,
varying amounts to be used for
scholarship purposes. Three of these
scholarships exist for the current
year, and faculty members are hoping
for an increased number in the years
to come.
Begun in March of 1948, the firm
| scholarship plun "demonstrates the
Continued interest of our law gradu
ates in a very tangible way,'' com
mented Professor Lowell Turrentine,
head of the Law Schrol Scholarship
Committee.
