## Bryan Brothers Cleared; Get Green Light Signal 
### 
By AL BERRY
v PCC Commissioner Vic Schmidt finished another turbulent
jiphapter in the "Saga of the Brothers Bryan" yesterday, as the
iSanity Code's "great white father" gave the OK to the cycling
|>air to continue their athletic careers against the Bruins tomorrow.
The confusion started Wednesday when the Chaparral, a local

humor magazine, appeared with a ♦
■mail advertisement on pasc 35. The
aicturc in this Menlo Cyclery ad ;
■howed hurdler Bob Bryan and his j
talented brother Gaylord Dean !
astride motorcycles. The brothers
wire wearing track shoes, sweat j
flothes, and the pix was taken in the
Stanford Stadium. Tlic ovcrline to
fhe ad read: "Four Speedsters . . ." |
t< was good advertising.
The Chappie comedy turned to
I near tragedy, however, when Coach
! .lark Wciershauser compared the
, ud with a small notation in the
IPCC Sanity Code Rule Book: "Any
{athlete who. t«*i- having registered j
in a member institution, allows his
name or photograph to appear in
connection with commercial adver- !
■ tising will henceforth lie immedi
ately declared ineligible for further
athletic competition."
' There was nothing for Dean of
Students, and Sanity Board member, I
poan Lawrence Kimpton to do but to
declare the pair ineligible until a
final investigation could be com- j
pleted. Coach Jack Wciershauser. j
the loss of .'JO points or so.
■I/as distinctly unhappy. The Broth
ers Bryan, seeing their preat athletic
Careers going out the window, felt
ifhat it was a bum rap. The Chappie j
editors, realizing that someone had i
blundered, were not ev.en laughing
at their own jokes. There was, in I
short, much unpleasantness in the

air last Wednesday.
Then slowly, bit by bit, the facts of
the case began to unfold. There had
been a foul-up at Chappie head
quarters. The Brothers, who knew—
as does everyone connected with ath
letics—of the ruling, had been under
the impression at the time the pix
was taken that it was being taken for
private, non-commercial purposes.
They did not know that the unkind
world of private enterprise would be
come involved as a result of their
boyish posing. They received no mo
torcycle, no gold, no coupons, no
United States or foreign currency
for the ill-famed ad, They had. then,
NOT "allowed" their picture or glo
rious names to be used for the eco
nomic interests of the Menlo Cyclery.
The Chappie had been off base in
allowing their unauthorized pix to
appear. The cyclery shop had been
in the wrong. The Brothers had been
mistreated.
These facts were vouched for in
documentary form by the concern
and by the Chappie and such forms
forwarded through Dean Kimpton
to Commissioner Schmidt. Schmidt
—in a telephone interview to the
Oakland Tribune yesterday — has
said that the boys are cleared and
can compete tomorrow with Ducky
Drake's Suuthlanders.

short, much unpleasantness in the

Then slowly, bit by bit, the facts of
the case began to unfold. There had
been a foul-up at Chappie head
quarters. The Brothers, who knew—
as does everyone connected with ath
letics—of the ruling, had been under
the impression at the time the pix
was taken that it was being taken for
private, non-commercial purposes.
They did not know that the unkind
world of private enterprise would be
come involved as a result of their
boyish posing. They received no mo

United States or foreign currency
for the ill-famed ad, They had. then,
NOT "allowed" their picture or glo
rious names to be used for the eco
nomic interests of the Menlo Cyclery.
The Chappie had been off base in
allowing their unauthorized pix to
appear. The cyclery shop had been
in the wrong. The Brothers had been
mistreated.
These facts were vouched for in
documentary form by the concern
and by the Chappie and such forms
forwarded through Dean Kimpton
to Commissioner Schmidt. Schmidt

Oakland Tribune yesterday — has
said that the boys are cleared and
can compete tomorrow with Ducky
