# Swimmers Face COP, Club Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tom Haynie's Indian swimming l
team will climb on a bus today at
noon, traveling to Stockton for a
dual meet with College of Pacific's
Timers, with or without the services
I of Ralph Sala.
Sala, NCAA champion at 440
] yards, took his finals yesterday and
! the results will be learned early
this morning. These finals are left ,
over from last quarter, since Sala
I was swimming in the Nationals dur
j ing finals week.
Top race today will be the breast
! stroke event, in which Ernie Polte,
blond transfer from Fullerton, will
; challenge Pacific's Jon Stcbbins. ;
; Stcbbins set a new National Junior
! College record last year in the 100- J
and 200-yard brcaststrokc, swim
| ming for Stockton JC. and his best !
times arc 1:01 and 2:22.
Polte has done 2:24, and will be
fresher than Stcbbins since the

J chubby "Tiger" will be swimming
100 yards in the medley relay. He
won't be allowed to loaf on this,
either, since Bob Frojen, Stanford's
second breaststroker, has done 1:02
! for the 100.
Tomorrow morning the Olympic
I C'ub will give the varsity a work
! out in the Enema Pools at 10. Only
threat is Jimmy Lee, distance swim
ming star of the club.
Lee is now attending Lowell High
, School, but is ineligible to compete
; for his school. Against the Cal Ag-
I gies last week. Lee won the 220 in
2:IG and the 4-10 in 4:56. Although
he is at his best in the odd-distance
| salt-water Olympic Club pool, Lee
will give lanky Pete Cole good races
; in both events, and could very con
ceivably win the furlong.
