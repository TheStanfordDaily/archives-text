The Stanford varsity golf team,
undefeated in five dual matches,
journeys to San Jose this afternoon
to meet the San Jose Spartans on
the La Rinconada course at 1.
Today's match will mark the first
meeting of the year for the Penin
sula's two top golf teams. The
match appears to be a toss-up, al
though the Spartans will have the
advantage fo playing on their home
course. The two squads matched
strokes a month ago in the Northern
California Intercollegiates, and the
Spartans edged the Indians for sec
ond spot by two shots.
Each team holds two victories
over St. Mary's this season, and
they both have conquered the San
Francisco Police team by decisive
margins. The Cards, however, will
be out for revenge after two losses
to the Spartans last year
Coach Bud Finger will use his
regular sixsome today. Jack Kno
shcr will switch positions with Bob
Crozier, however. Bud Moe will
continue to play the number one
position, followed by Knosher, Cro
zier, Dick McElyca, John Wallace,
and Dave Mitten.
The Spartans will be led by War
ren McCarty, NIC individual cham
pion, Jay Hopkins, and Al Zacha
rian.
Tomorrow morning at 9, the In
dians wi'l swing into action against
the San Diego State Aztecs. The
Aztecs boast the services of Gene
Littler, runner-up in the California
Amateur tournament last year. Lit
tler lost on the 40t.h hole after post
ing two birdies and an eagle on the
first three overtime holes. Still he
lost!
