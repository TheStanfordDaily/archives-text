: regsitered a best-ever 1:55.0 in his
j last race against the Olympic Club
! and San Jose State two weeks ago.

! who is finally in shape, may
elect to run the two-mile.
A new NCAA javelin record may
be set tomorrow. Stanford's spear
; ace, Bud Held, will meet his first
stifT competition of the year in Bruin
; Cy Young. Young threw the javelin
221 ft. .v'm in. two weeks ago. Hold's
best, 233 ft. 4Vli in,, is less than a foot
short of Trojan Bob Peoples' NCAA

i. : nder ace, plans to compete in the
100, the 220. the high jump, and ;i
new event, the high hurdles. This
will mark the first time that Bryan
has run the highs in competition, and
he will have to break 15-flat to beat
teammates Dell Russell and Bill

in both hurdle events.
Brother Bob Bryan is a heavy fa
vorite to take the low hurdles, while
Indians Jim PolUr.'k and Bill Storum
will fight it out for second place. Bob
Bryan will he sharpening up for his
tough race next week with Cal's im
' proving Ted Rademaker. who beat

rier race at Berkeley last Saturday.
HofT Doubtful Starter
In the 440, Stanford cindermen
Pitch Johnson and Cass Bly should
; win in a walkaway. Co-captain Larry
Hoff is a doubtful starter, and may
J save himself for next week's crucial
with Cal. UCLA newcomers Ralph
| Manus and Sam Horta have yet to
break 50 seconds this year.
