# WOMEN'S DRAWING
## AWS Debates Spring Change 
### 
Proposals for revision of the spring
quarter drawing system so as to give
i .seniors and juniors a chance to live
where they want to were discussed
at AWS meeting yesterday and will
bo referred to the women's houses
| next week.
AWS also passed recommendations
i which will be refei red to the newly
formed ASSU Activities Board.
The present system of spring quar
ter drawing allots places by a sys
tem of ratios. The ratio of vacan
cies allotted each class is determined
I by the number of women of that class
j drawing.
i
However, a number of upper class
| men have evidenced disapproval of
this system because they have not
been placed where they would like to
be even after several drawings. The
proposed changes would give uppcr
i classmen preference and thus allow
j more of them to get in houses they
J want .
Three methods of arriving at this
j objective have been suggested and
discussed. They arc the following
changes:
1. Straight class preferential, as in
: regular drawings of other than spring
quarter. This would give seniors first
choice, followed by juniors and
sophomores. Every girl would have
; an equal chance to be placed accord-
I ing to her wants as she advanced in
j class status.
2. "Inverted" ratio. This would al
lot vacancies on a ratio for ouch class,
with seniors having the largest ratio.
; 'Die result would be essentially the
J same as the first proposal.
3. A combination of the preferen-
I tial and ratio. By this suggestion,
seniors would be given preference
I over other classes and juniors and
sophomores would be placed accord
j ing to the ratio of those drawing,
j This would be of special favor to the
! seniors.
' These suggestions will be dis
cussed at house meetings Monday
night. The women's ideas will then
j be taken back to AWS meeting next
| week.
Activities recommendations by
AWS, presented by Collettc Combs,
j chairman of a special committee ap
, pointed to work out suggestions, in
; elude the proposal that a social ac
j tivities calendar be made and sent to
j campus social chairmen the end of
j the quarter before they will take
! place.
j It wa>i also suggested that "Back
I to the Farm Week" be condensed —
! either 1o an independent "Back to
; the Farm Day" or to a day during
i Con Home Week.

at AWS meeting yesterday and will
bo referred to the women's houses
| next week.
AWS also passed recommendations
i which will be refei red to the newly
formed ASSU Activities Board.
The present system of spring quar
ter drawing allots places by a sys
tem of ratios. The ratio of vacan
cies allotted each class is determined
I by the number of women of that class
j drawing.
i
However, a number of upper class
| men have evidenced disapproval of
this system because they have not
been placed where they would like to
be even after several drawings. The
proposed changes would give uppcr
i classmen preference and thus allow
j more of them to get in houses they
J want .
Three methods of arriving at this
j objective have been suggested and
discussed. They arc the following
changes:
1. Straight class preferential, as in
: regular drawings of other than spring
quarter. This would give seniors first
choice, followed by juniors and
sophomores. Every girl would have
; an equal chance to be placed accord-
I ing to her wants as she advanced in
j class status.
2. "Inverted" ratio. This would al
lot vacancies on a ratio for ouch class,
with seniors having the largest ratio.
; 'Die result would be essentially the
J same as the first proposal.
3. A combination of the preferen-
I tial and ratio. By this suggestion,
seniors would be given preference
I over other classes and juniors and
sophomores would be placed accord
j ing to the ratio of those drawing,
j This would be of special favor to the
! seniors.
' These suggestions will be dis
cussed at house meetings Monday
night. The women's ideas will then
j be taken back to AWS meeting next
| week.
Activities recommendations by
AWS, presented by Collettc Combs,
j chairman of a special committee ap
, pointed to work out suggestions, in
; elude the proposal that a social ac
j tivities calendar be made and sent to
j campus social chairmen the end of
j the quarter before they will take
! place.
j It wa>i also suggested that "Back
I to the Farm Week" be condensed —
! either 1o an independent "Back to
; the Farm Day" or to a day during
i Con Home Week.
