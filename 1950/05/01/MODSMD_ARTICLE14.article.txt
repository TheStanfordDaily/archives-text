# Foreigners' Welcome Set
## 
### 
Stanford students wi'l once again
extend a personal welcome to each
foreign student arriving here for
the first time next September. Stu
dents wishing to bo hpsts this fall
may sign up tomorrow through Fri
day in front of the Cellar.
The foreign student host program
was started last year by a group of
students aware of the problems
which beset a foreign student start
ing life at an American university.
A student aeting as host to a for
eign student is fulfilling the same
duty he would toward a guest in
his own home. He tries to make the
guest feel as welcome and as much
at ease as is possible.
Hosts can help most during reg
istration and the first few weeks of
school. Things listed as most help
ful by the foreign students included
registration procedure, taking lec
ture notes, buying books, catching
rides to campus, learning to speak
English and especially American
slang expressions. In one unique
case a host's wife helped the wife
of their foreign student guest with
shopping and housekeeping prob
lems.
