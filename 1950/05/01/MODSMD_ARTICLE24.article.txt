### JOHN HALL 
Thinking about Hoover Tower being closed all day
yesterday was about as pitiful as listening to Jack
Weiei shanser tell how he almost lost Gay Bryan last
week.
Moor old Hoover Tower. While hundreds of persons

arc pounding at its doors crying
to get in every Sunday, it just sits
(here, locked up as tight as Roble
;i I LMil in the morning.
( old, harsh, uncompromising
that's Hoover Tower on Sunday, a
olitary and lonely monument, as
n .eless as a glass of water at Sat
urday night's IJelt Beachcomber.
And nobody cares. Nobody
cares.
(Pardon me for a minute while
I wipe the lather off my chin and

tt-cite my prayers God bless Mac Arthur; Do away
with Vivisection; and Open up Hoover Tower on Sun

day.)
Bull Session cares. Yes, 1 say, Bull Session cares.
With banners waving, cross held high, and the asso
ciate editors locked in the next room, Bull Session will
march on—energetic, enthusiastic, pledged to its pur
pose.
Open up Hoover Tower on Sunday!
And rememl.er, if you would have a stable friend,«
buy a horse. (Which doesn't have much to do with the
discussion, but is definitely needed along about this
point.)
So much for crusades. If Hank Rosin, Ted Buttner,
Dean Kimpton, or Lloyd Coombs would like to look
into the kiea, I would be glad to offer them my vast j
library of information on why and how Hoover Tower
can be opened on Sunday without dropping football
from the school program. If not, what the Hoover, I'd
rather spend my Sundays slopping up the sun at the
amphitheater, anyway.
It's always open.
