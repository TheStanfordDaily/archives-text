# CAMPUS OPINION
## More About the Water Carnival 
### 
To the Editor:
In answer to the criticism of the Junior Water Carni
val that appeared in Wednesday's Daily, we would like
to pick, up some of the pieces and present the .'acts.
To begin with, the Water Carnival and Shipwreck
Dance were orginally planned for Saturday, April 28,
hut when the date came up before Excorn, it was
found that Toyon had an all-campus dance planned
)in that night and had already spent a great deal of
money on it. Feeling that the campus could not sup
port two such events on the same dale, Excom refused
to OK both, and the Water Carnival was forced up a
week. The four chairmen were given the go-ahead
■ tgn on Thursday, April 6, and the entry blanks were
in every social chairman's hands on Monday, April 10,
or the Post Otlice slipped up.
The sign-up sheet for the floats was checked on
Monday, April 17, at which time there were no dupli
cations of floats—the first four signed up had stated
no theme. When the final list was checked on Wednes
day three of those four had filled in themes, and one
of them duplicated a theme farther down on the list.
Obviously it was too late to remedy the matter, and
there certainly is enough originality on this campus to
have two very different floats on the same subject, as
proved to be the case with the "Birth of Venus."
The order of.floats was purposely left open until the
day of the carnival. Most of the floats were put to
-1 ether at the lake, in the water. There was no need to
have a set order to make them rearrange themselves
when they could so simply move in the order in which
[bey were put into the water in the first place.
As to the accidents that occurred, or nearly oc
curred, a boy's foot was badly cut when he stepped
on a piece of glass in the shallow water at the lake
edge upon getting out of a canoe. Also, it is doul tful
if turning off the unauthorized motor on the float
which bumped the dock had anything to do with that
collision, and the mere presence of the swimmers in
the water, authorized or not, made such action man
datory.
Admitted, the Water Carnival was not perfect, but
ii the people who criticize would take the trouble to
find out the facts first, their criticisms would be more

To the Editor:
As crew members of the "Big Mo" in the Junior
Water Carnival, we feel that we have been wronged
hy 'J he Daily's write-up of the battle between the Phi
leaps' "Mighty Mo" and the Zetes' fighting Modfl T.
For the benefit of The Daily's leaders, the 34-foot
"liig Mo" was not sunk in spite of the efforts of the
Zetes and numerous other attackers, but run aground
by her eiew after the battle a.id then decommissioned.

To the Editor:
Being in my position, the letter to the editor which
appealed in The Daily last Wednesday left me a bit
up in the air over the prevailing attitude of its authors,
and I felt it necessary to write this reply in defense of
our Water Carnival chairmen.
We will grant that publicity was slow, but this was
nol because the affair was not planned far enough in
advance. Early last January we scheduled the week
end of the 21st and 22nd for the Junior Water Carnival
:<nd Shipwreck Dance. Three weeks before this set
date we were informed that our" affair would conflict
with the Toyon formal on which a good deal of money
had already been spent. We were left no alternative
but to have our carnival one week earlier than origi
nally planned, and were left with only two weeks to
make all of the arrangements.
Although our chairmen had already been chosen,
we had no time at all to make the arrangements, which
we would originally have had one week to plan, in
order to give the living groups and the school two
weeks' notice.
I feel that our chairmen: Tom August, Sue Decker,
Winnie Ainesworth, and Joe Cusjck, deserve much
more than the double-cross 'for their efforts against
such odds beyond the call of duty. In one day they
reviewed the reports from all of the previous carni
vals, published and sent out a two-page notice to the
living groups of the rules, theme, and other informa
tion regarding the carnival, and did everything but
print the pesters. The turnout last Saturday showed
that there was plenty of notice and preparation. The
chairmen of the 23 floats should also be commended
for one of the best showings in the history of the
Water Carnival.
The fact that there may have been some duplication
regarding any float was entirely the fault of the mem
ber who registered the float for not checking over the
list he was signing.
As for the cause of the general confusion, I suppose
we could have put up a tremendous windbreak and
had a power tug to pull each float across the lake so
it wouldn't blow .off course, but I'll admit we didn't
think of this.
I learned this week from Mr. Glover, director of
information, that the Life photographer who had us
hopping was unable to attend, but he now plans on
covering the Spring Sing. He may become a myth be
fore long. ,
As the authors of Wednesday's article so beautifully
put it,"the carnival is behind us." I hope that in the
future the authors of such letters will think of spend
ing as much time working on the affair as it would
take them to write the editor and tear apart the efforts
of their classmates.

more than the double-cross 'for their efforts against
such odds beyond the call of duty. In one day they
reviewed the reports from all of the previous carni
vals, published and sent out a two-page notice to the
living groups of the rules, theme, and other informa
tion regarding the carnival, and did everything but
print the pesters. The turnout last Saturday showed
that there was plenty of notice and preparation. The
chairmen of the 23 floats should also be commended
for one of the best showings in the history of the
Water Carnival.
The fact that there may have been some duplication
regarding any float was entirely the fault of the mem
ber who registered the float for not checking over the
list he was signing.
As for the cause of the general confusion, I suppose
we could have put up a tremendous windbreak and
had a power tug to pull each float across the lake so
it wouldn't blow .off course, but I'll admit we didn't
think of this.
I learned this week from Mr. Glover, director of
information, that the Life photographer who had us
hopping was unable to attend, but he now plans on
covering the Spring Sing. He may become a myth be
fore long. ,
As the authors of Wednesday's article so beautifully
put it,"the carnival is behind us." I hope that in the

take them to write the editor and tear apart the efforts

To the Editor:
In answer to the criticism of the Junior Water Carni
val that appeared in Wednesday's Daily, we would like
to pick, up some of the pieces and present the .'acts.
To begin with, the Water Carnival and Shipwreck
Dance were orginally planned for Saturday, April 28,
hut when the date came up before Excorn, it was
found that Toyon had an all-campus dance planned
)in that night and had already spent a great deal of
money on it. Feeling that the campus could not sup
port two such events on the same dale, Excom refused
to OK both, and the Water Carnival was forced up a
week. The four chairmen were given the go-ahead
■ tgn on Thursday, April 6, and the entry blanks were
in every social chairman's hands on Monday, April 10,
or the Post Otlice slipped up.
The sign-up sheet for the floats was checked on
Monday, April 17, at which time there were no dupli
cations of floats—the first four signed up had stated
no theme. When the final list was checked on Wednes
day three of those four had filled in themes, and one
of them duplicated a theme farther down on the list.
Obviously it was too late to remedy the matter, and
there certainly is enough originality on this campus to
have two very different floats on the same subject, as
proved to be the case with the "Birth of Venus."
The order of.floats was purposely left open until the
day of the carnival. Most of the floats were put to
-1 ether at the lake, in the water. There was no need to
have a set order to make them rearrange themselves
when they could so simply move in the order in which
[bey were put into the water in the first place.
As to the accidents that occurred, or nearly oc
curred, a boy's foot was badly cut when he stepped
on a piece of glass in the shallow water at the lake
edge upon getting out of a canoe. Also, it is doul tful
if turning off the unauthorized motor on the float
which bumped the dock had anything to do with that
collision, and the mere presence of the swimmers in
the water, authorized or not, made such action man
datory.
Admitted, the Water Carnival was not perfect, but
ii the people who criticize would take the trouble to
find out the facts first, their criticisms would be more

For the benefit of The Daily's leaders, the 34-foot

To the Editor:
Being in my position, the letter to the editor which
appealed in The Daily last Wednesday left me a bit
up in the air over the prevailing attitude of its authors,
and I felt it necessary to write this reply in defense of
our Water Carnival chairmen.
We will grant that publicity was slow, but this was
nol because the affair was not planned far enough in
advance. Early last January we scheduled the week
end of the 21st and 22nd for the Junior Water Carnival
:<nd Shipwreck Dance. Three weeks before this set
date we were informed that our" affair would conflict
with the Toyon formal on which a good deal of money
had already been spent. We were left no alternative
but to have our carnival one week earlier than origi
nally planned, and were left with only two weeks to
make all of the arrangements.
Although our chairmen had already been chosen,
we had no time at all to make the arrangements, which
we would originally have had one week to plan, in
order to give the living groups and the school two
weeks' notice.
I feel that our chairmen: Tom August, Sue Decker,
Winnie Ainesworth, and Joe Cusjck, deserve much
more than the double-cross 'for their efforts against
such odds beyond the call of duty. In one day they

hy 'J he Daily's write-up of the battle between the Phi
leaps' "Mighty Mo" and the Zetes' fighting Modfl T.
For the benefit of The Daily's leaders, the 34-foot
"liig Mo" was not sunk in spite of the efforts of the
Zetes and numerous other attackers, but run aground
by her eiew after the battle a.id then decommissioned.

To the Editor:
Being in my position, the letter to the editor which
appealed in The Daily last Wednesday left me a bit
up in the air over the prevailing attitude of its authors,
and I felt it necessary to write this reply in defense of
our Water Carnival chairmen.
We will grant that publicity was slow, but this was
nol because the affair was not planned far enough in
advance. Early last January we scheduled the week
end of the 21st and 22nd for the Junior Water Carnival
:<nd Shipwreck Dance. Three weeks before this set
date we were informed that our" affair would conflict
with the Toyon formal on which a good deal of money
had already been spent. We were left no alternative
but to have our carnival one week earlier than origi
nally planned, and were left with only two weeks to
make all of the arrangements.
Although our chairmen had already been chosen,
we had no time at all to make the arrangements, which
we would originally have had one week to plan, in
order to give the living groups and the school two
weeks' notice.
I feel that our chairmen: Tom August, Sue Decker,
Winnie Ainesworth, and Joe Cusjck, deserve much
more than the double-cross 'for their efforts against
such odds beyond the call of duty. In one day they
reviewed the reports from all of the previous carni
vals, published and sent out a two-page notice to the
living groups of the rules, theme, and other informa
tion regarding the carnival, and did everything but
print the pesters. The turnout last Saturday showed
that there was plenty of notice and preparation. The
chairmen of the 23 floats should also be commended
for one of the best showings in the history of the
Water Carnival.
The fact that there may have been some duplication
regarding any float was entirely the fault of the mem
ber who registered the float for not checking over the
list he was signing.
As for the cause of the general confusion, I suppose
we could have put up a tremendous windbreak and
had a power tug to pull each float across the lake so
it wouldn't blow .off course, but I'll admit we didn't
think of this.
I learned this week from Mr. Glover, director of
information, that the Life photographer who had us
hopping was unable to attend, but he now plans on
covering the Spring Sing. He may become a myth be
fore long. ,
As the authors of Wednesday's article so beautifully
put it,"the carnival is behind us." I hope that in the
future the authors of such letters will think of spend
ing as much time working on the affair as it would
take them to write the editor and tear apart the efforts
of their classmates.

To the Editor:
In answer to the criticism of the Junior Water Carni
val that appeared in Wednesday's Daily, we would like
to pick, up some of the pieces and present the .'acts.
To begin with, the Water Carnival and Shipwreck
Dance were orginally planned for Saturday, April 28,
hut when the date came up before Excorn, it was
found that Toyon had an all-campus dance planned
)in that night and had already spent a great deal of
money on it. Feeling that the campus could not sup
port two such events on the same dale, Excom refused
to OK both, and the Water Carnival was forced up a
week. The four chairmen were given the go-ahead
■ tgn on Thursday, April 6, and the entry blanks were
in every social chairman's hands on Monday, April 10,
or the Post Otlice slipped up.
The sign-up sheet for the floats was checked on
Monday, April 17, at which time there were no dupli
cations of floats—the first four signed up had stated
no theme. When the final list was checked on Wednes
day three of those four had filled in themes, and one
of them duplicated a theme farther down on the list.
Obviously it was too late to remedy the matter, and
there certainly is enough originality on this campus to
have two very different floats on the same subject, as
proved to be the case with the "Birth of Venus."
The order of.floats was purposely left open until the
day of the carnival. Most of the floats were put to
-1 ether at the lake, in the water. There was no need to
have a set order to make them rearrange themselves
when they could so simply move in the order in which
[bey were put into the water in the first place.
As to the accidents that occurred, or nearly oc
curred, a boy's foot was badly cut when he stepped
on a piece of glass in the shallow water at the lake
edge upon getting out of a canoe. Also, it is doul tful
if turning off the unauthorized motor on the float
which bumped the dock had anything to do with that
collision, and the mere presence of the swimmers in
the water, authorized or not, made such action man
datory.
Admitted, the Water Carnival was not perfect, but
ii the people who criticize would take the trouble to
find out the facts first, their criticisms would be more
