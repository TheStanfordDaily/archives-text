# Traditional Con Home Drive Means Yearly Support for Kids

### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Big red bows perched on top of
| girlish curls and white shirts and
shorts signify Stanford's youngest
and most enthusiastic group of
rooters —the part of the Farm fam
ily that lives at the Convalescent
Home.
These youngsters are sent each
year from clinics in the San Fran
cisco area to convalesce at Senator
Stanford's former home, a 26-acre
estate equipped with a realistic doll
house, a playground, a tree house
for the girls, and three wards with
outdoor porches overlooking green
lawns and colorful Hower-beds—all
of which encourage a happy and
j healthy recovery.
The Stanford Convalescent Home
is entirely supported by charity.
Stanford students, through the
funds collected in the Con Home
Drive, contribute to the upkeep of
i lour beds a year, each bed costing
$5 a day.
Stanford is the only university
I which supports a charity of this
j kind.
When the Con Home first started
in 1920, the director, Mrs. Ruth At-
I wood, a Stanford graduate herself,
j instilled the spirit of the Farm by
! wearing a red cape instead of the

usual blue on her white
uniform. Soon the nurses decided
it might be fun to wear red sweat
ers over their uniforms. The chil
dren completed the color harmony
by wearing red bows (the girls) in
their hair and white shorts and
shirts.
The growth of the Con Home
Drive has meant the building up of
the Home's facilities and the initia
tion of various student activities
which have developed into annual
traditions.
Twenty-seven years ago, for the
first time, students were asked to
contribute to the monthly expense
of maintaining the home and no
particular goal was set for the drive.
By 1929 enthusiasm and backing
for the drive had increased, and the
students collected $4,000. The next
year, the Masque Ball and Labor
Day were supplemented by the sale
of tags for election of King and
Queen. But the drive was $500 be
low the 1929 record, although the
women students contributed an av
erage of $2.72 per person. (Men
students gave 58 cents per person.)
Bean Day was another new activ
ity inititaed in 1933. Students ate
only beans and apples for lunch and
the 30 cents saved per person went
to the Con Home Drive. A Straw
berry Brunch was held in the after
noon, however, to relieve empty
stomachs.
In 1537 a variety of events were
added to the already popular Con
Home activities — an air show,
swimming meet, theater benefit,
Junior Water Carnival, tourna
ments, Sophomore Carnival, debate,
and basketball game.
The spirit of the Gay 'Nineties
helped the Drive laong in 1941,

when as a part of "Back to the
Farm" students were required to
dress in the styles of 1890. No cars
were allowed on campus and a
horse and buggy was the order of
the day. A Gay 'Nineties dance cli
maxed the festivities that year,
which drew in $5,000.
The record was broken in 1947
when $9,000 was collected. Off-cam
pus students played a large part in
this drive by contributing one-third
of the large total.
Last year the showing of "Gone
With the Wind" in Mem Aud was
an extra feature of the Con Home
events, and the drive reached $4,000.

events, and the drive reached $4,000.
Big red bows perched on top of
| girlish curls and white shirts and
shorts signify Stanford's youngest
and most enthusiastic group of
rooters —the part of the Farm fam
ily that lives at the Convalescent
Home.
These youngsters are sent each
year from clinics in the San Fran
cisco area to convalesce at Senator
Stanford's former home, a 26-acre
estate equipped with a realistic doll
house, a playground, a tree house
for the girls, and three wards with
outdoor porches overlooking green
lawns and colorful Hower-beds—all
of which encourage a happy and
j healthy recovery.
The Stanford Convalescent Home
is entirely supported by charity.
Stanford students, through the
funds collected in the Con Home
Drive, contribute to the upkeep of
i lour beds a year, each bed costing
$5 a day.
Stanford is the only university
I which supports a charity of this
j kind.
When the Con Home first started
in 1920, the director, Mrs. Ruth At-
I wood, a Stanford graduate herself,
j instilled the spirit of the Farm by
! wearing a red cape instead of the

usual blue on her white
uniform. Soon the nurses decided
it might be fun to wear red sweat
ers over their uniforms. The chil
dren completed the color harmony
by wearing red bows (the girls) in
their hair and white shorts and
shirts.
The growth of the Con Home
Drive has meant the building up of
the Home's facilities and the initia
tion of various student activities
which have developed into annual
traditions.
Twenty-seven years ago, for the
first time, students were asked to
contribute to the monthly expense
of maintaining the home and no
particular goal was set for the drive.
By 1929 enthusiasm and backing
for the drive had increased, and the
students collected $4,000. The next
year, the Masque Ball and Labor
Day were supplemented by the sale
of tags for election of King and
Queen. But the drive was $500 be
low the 1929 record, although the
women students contributed an av
erage of $2.72 per person. (Men
students gave 58 cents per person.)
Bean Day was another new activ
ity inititaed in 1933. Students ate
only beans and apples for lunch and
the 30 cents saved per person went
to the Con Home Drive. A Straw
berry Brunch was held in the after
noon, however, to relieve empty
stomachs.
In 1537 a variety of events were
added to the already popular Con
Home activities — an air show,
swimming meet, theater benefit,
Junior Water Carnival, tourna
ments, Sophomore Carnival, debate,
and basketball game.
The spirit of the Gay 'Nineties
helped the Drive laong in 1941,

when as a part of "Back to the
Farm" students were required to
dress in the styles of 1890. No cars
were allowed on campus and a
horse and buggy was the order of
the day. A Gay 'Nineties dance cli
maxed the festivities that year,
which drew in $5,000.
The record was broken in 1947
when $9,000 was collected. Off-cam
pus students played a large part in
this drive by contributing one-third
of the large total.
Last year the showing of "Gone
With the Wind" in Mem Aud was
an extra feature of the Con Home
events, and the drive reached $4,000.
