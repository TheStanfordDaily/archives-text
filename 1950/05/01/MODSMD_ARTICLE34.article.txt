# Mermen Split Weekend Pair
## 
### NORM RITTER 
Stanford's varsity mermen won
and lost in a pair of weekend en
gagements. And in so doing, they
(1) marred their previously spot
less dual meet record and (2) failed
in their first real test against a ma
jor foe.
The Indians bowed to the COP
Tigers 45 Vj to 29 1 -j in Stockton Fri
day afternoon, and eased past the
Olympic Club 52 to 22 in Encina
Pool Saturday.
Haynie's men had a sound ex
cuse for losing the Pacific affair by
a margin of up to six points since
Ralph Sala did not receive an okay
to swim after taking some deferred
finals. But the Tigers were well
aware of this and proceeded to
swim so well that even the pres
ence of Sala wouldn't have changed
the outcome.
COP Nabs Relay
The Bengals' impressive point
bulge resulted from their copping
both the medely and the four-man
relay. The valley boys were favored
in the 300 - yard event, but their
anticlimactic victory in the four
man was unexpected. The Tigers
cinched the meet in the next-to-!ast
vent, the 440, when Dick Cullen
ward outlasted George Mowat in
the battle for second place. Stan
ford's Pete Cole won.
Senior Bob Steel paced the upset
of the Cards. He won the 100 in
53.7 and swam a pair of century
laps in the relays in the unofficial
times of 53.0 and 53.3. Jon Stcb
bin's 2:22 200-yard bi'eaststroke ef
fort set a new Stanford-COP meet
standard.
OC Little Trouble
Back in their home tank, the In
dians had litt l e trouble notching
their second win of the season over
Jim Lee & Co.
In the middle distances, Lee and
Cole hooked up in the third re
newal of their 1950 rivalry. The
Lowell High sensation triumphed in
the furlong with a sharp 2:15.5 per
formance, then Cole came back to
nip Lee in the 440. Both posted
times of 4:52.4.
Freestyler Bruce Putnam entered
the backstroke for the second day in
a row and turned in a surprise win
over teammate Jack Weeden. Put
nam was clocked at 1:41.5.
Stanford will spend next week
end in the Southland, meeting UC
LA on Friday and PCC title-hold-
I ing USC on Saturday. They return
the following week for a May 13
; set-to with Cal and conclude with
the conference meet at Berkeley on
May 20.

and lost in a pair of weekend en
gagements. And in so doing, they
(1) marred their previously spot
less dual meet record and (2) failed

jor foe.
The Indians bowed to the COP
Tigers 45 Vj to 29 1 -j in Stockton Fri
day afternoon, and eased past the
Olympic Club 52 to 22 in Encina
Pool Saturday.
Haynie's men had a sound ex
cuse for losing the Pacific affair by
a margin of up to six points since
Ralph Sala did not receive an okay
to swim after taking some deferred
finals. But the Tigers were well
aware of this and proceeded to
swim so well that even the pres
ence of Sala wouldn't have changed
the outcome.
COP Nabs Relay
The Bengals' impressive point
bulge resulted from their copping
both the medely and the four-man
relay. The valley boys were favored
in the 300 - yard event, but their
anticlimactic victory in the four
man was unexpected. The Tigers
cinched the meet in the next-to-!ast
vent, the 440, when Dick Cullen
ward outlasted George Mowat in
the battle for second place. Stan
ford's Pete Cole won.
Senior Bob Steel paced the upset
of the Cards. He won the 100 in
53.7 and swam a pair of century
laps in the relays in the unofficial
times of 53.0 and 53.3. Jon Stcb
bin's 2:22 200-yard bi'eaststroke ef
fort set a new Stanford-COP meet
standard.

Back in their home tank, the In
dians had litt l e trouble notching
their second win of the season over
Jim Lee & Co.
In the middle distances, Lee and
Cole hooked up in the third re
newal of their 1950 rivalry. The
Lowell High sensation triumphed in
the furlong with a sharp 2:15.5 per
formance, then Cole came back to
nip Lee in the 440. Both posted
times of 4:52.4.
