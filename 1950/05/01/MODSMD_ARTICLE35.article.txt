# Diamondmen Hold Lead in CIBA Race; Overpower Bruins by Twelve Tallies
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford maintained its grip on first place in the current CIBA
race Saturday afternoon by soundly thumping a motley crew of
odd and assorted characters in UCLA baseball uniforms, 17 to 5, in
the Sunken Diamond.
It was Jack Heinen's day as the husky Indian hurler limited the

Bruins to five base hits while striking*
out eight men. He struck out the side :
in the sixth and ninth innings. Hei- j
nen also led the Cards' 15—hit attack
with a triple, a double, and single in
tour trips to the plate.
The Bruins, who look like a solid
choice for the CIBA cellar, cstab- j
lished themselves as champion belly
achers and crybabies in the moan and j
groan department during their two- j
game invasion of Santa Clara and
Stanford. In Friday night's game at
Broncoville, UCLA Coach Art
Reichle reached the disgraceful point
for a college baseball mentor when ■
he cried so long and loud that he was
finally thumbed from the game.
First Inning Lead
Stanford established a lead in the
first inning that was only slightly I
threatened by the Bruins in the sec- j
ond frame.. Bruce Cameron and
Charlie Cole led off by drawing bases j
on balls, and Cameron came home
with the first run of the ballgame, j
when UCLA's starting chucker, Ray i
O'Connor threw Bud Klein's sacri- '
fice bunt into right field.
Dave Melton and Dick Clegg drove
across three more runs with consecu
tive singles into left field. O Connor
was then retired from the game with- j
out getting a single man out. Stan
ford pounded out two more base hits i
off reliefer Bob McNeil and might
have pushed their run production for
the inning into two-digit figures if 1
Clegg and Jim Castagnoli had not
been thrown out attempting to steal j
home.
Bruins Score
UCLA moved within one run of
the Cards in the second inning when
they put together a Stanford error, a
! single by Phil Seinberg, and a triple
by Pete Moody to score three runs.
The Indians picked up another run
I in the second when Heinen walked
and Bruce Cameron choked up to
bunt, then completely fooled every
one by swinging at the ball and lacing
it into left eenterfield for a triple.
Still More Runs
Stanford gathered four more runs
i in the fourth on three base hits and
, a Bruin error. Cameron's inside-t'he- j
park home run into eenterfield with ;
one aboard was the big blow of the i
inning. • # ,
The Indians completed the day's
' scoring in the sixth with five runs on j
a single by John Claypool, Heinen's
triple, and a pair of UCLA errors,

UCLA 030-020-000— 5
Stanford 4JO-535-OOx —17
Stanford maintained its grip on first place in the current CIBA
race Saturday afternoon by soundly thumping a motley crew of
odd and assorted characters in UCLA baseball uniforms, 17 to 5, in
the Sunken Diamond.
It was Jack Heinen's day as the husky Indian hurler limited the

Bruins to five base hits while striking*
out eight men. He struck out the side :
in the sixth and ninth innings. Hei- j
nen also led the Cards' 15—hit attack
with a triple, a double, and single in
tour trips to the plate.
The Bruins, who look like a solid
choice for the CIBA cellar, cstab- j
lished themselves as champion belly
achers and crybabies in the moan and j
groan department during their two- j
game invasion of Santa Clara and
Stanford. In Friday night's game at
Broncoville, UCLA Coach Art
Reichle reached the disgraceful point
for a college baseball mentor when ■
he cried so long and loud that he was
finally thumbed from the game.
First Inning Lead
Stanford established a lead in the
first inning that was only slightly I
threatened by the Bruins in the sec- j
ond frame.. Bruce Cameron and
Charlie Cole led off by drawing bases j
on balls, and Cameron came home
with the first run of the ballgame, j
when UCLA's starting chucker, Ray i
O'Connor threw Bud Klein's sacri- '
fice bunt into right field.
Dave Melton and Dick Clegg drove
across three more runs with consecu
tive singles into left field. O Connor
was then retired from the game with- j
out getting a single man out. Stan
ford pounded out two more base hits i
off reliefer Bob McNeil and might
have pushed their run production for
the inning into two-digit figures if 1
Clegg and Jim Castagnoli had not
been thrown out attempting to steal j
home.
Bruins Score
UCLA moved within one run of
the Cards in the second inning when
they put together a Stanford error, a
! single by Phil Seinberg, and a triple
by Pete Moody to score three runs.
The Indians picked up another run
I in the second when Heinen walked
and Bruce Cameron choked up to
bunt, then completely fooled every
one by swinging at the ball and lacing
it into left eenterfield for a triple.
Still More Runs
Stanford gathered four more runs
i in the fourth on three base hits and
, a Bruin error. Cameron's inside-t'he- j
park home run into eenterfield with ;
one aboard was the big blow of the i
inning. • # ,
The Indians completed the day's
' scoring in the sixth with five runs on j
a single by John Claypool, Heinen's
triple, and a pair of UCLA errors,

UCLA 030-020-000— 5
Stanford 4JO-535-OOx —17
Stanford maintained its grip on first place in the current CIBA
race Saturday afternoon by soundly thumping a motley crew of
odd and assorted characters in UCLA baseball uniforms, 17 to 5, in
the Sunken Diamond.
It was Jack Heinen's day as the husky Indian hurler limited the

Bruins to five base hits while striking*
out eight men. He struck out the side :
in the sixth and ninth innings. Hei- j
nen also led the Cards' 15—hit attack
with a triple, a double, and single in
tour trips to the plate.
The Bruins, who look like a solid
choice for the CIBA cellar, cstab- j
lished themselves as champion belly
achers and crybabies in the moan and j
groan department during their two- j
game invasion of Santa Clara and
Stanford. In Friday night's game at
Broncoville, UCLA Coach Art
Reichle reached the disgraceful point
for a college baseball mentor when ■
he cried so long and loud that he was
finally thumbed from the game.
First Inning Lead
Stanford established a lead in the
first inning that was only slightly I
threatened by the Bruins in the sec- j
ond frame.. Bruce Cameron and
Charlie Cole led off by drawing bases j
on balls, and Cameron came home
with the first run of the ballgame, j
when UCLA's starting chucker, Ray i
O'Connor threw Bud Klein's sacri- '
fice bunt into right field.
Dave Melton and Dick Clegg drove
across three more runs with consecu
tive singles into left field. O Connor
was then retired from the game with- j
out getting a single man out. Stan
ford pounded out two more base hits i
off reliefer Bob McNeil and might
have pushed their run production for
the inning into two-digit figures if 1
Clegg and Jim Castagnoli had not
been thrown out attempting to steal j
home.
Bruins Score
UCLA moved within one run of
the Cards in the second inning when
they put together a Stanford error, a
! single by Phil Seinberg, and a triple
by Pete Moody to score three runs.
The Indians picked up another run
I in the second when Heinen walked
and Bruce Cameron choked up to
bunt, then completely fooled every
one by swinging at the ball and lacing
it into left eenterfield for a triple.
Still More Runs
Stanford gathered four more runs
i in the fourth on three base hits and
, a Bruin error. Cameron's inside-t'he- j
park home run into eenterfield with ;
one aboard was the big blow of the i
inning. • # ,
The Indians completed the day's
' scoring in the sixth with five runs on j
a single by John Claypool, Heinen's
triple, and a pair of UCLA errors,
