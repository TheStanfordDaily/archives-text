# McCarthy vs. Truman
## 
### 
WASHINGTON Senator McCar
thy (I?., Wis.) said today that Pres
ident Truman either was seeking
"political advantage" or was poorly
informed in saying Communism is
not a major force in this country.
â€¢McCarthy described as "extreme
ly disturbing" Mr. Truman's asser
tion that "the greatest threat to us
does not come from the Communists
in this country." but rather from
"Communist imperialism abroad,
where the center of its military and
economic strength lies."
