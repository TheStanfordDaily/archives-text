TAIPEI, Formosa, May 1 (/]') â€”
The Nationalists tonight charged i
tluit new jet liahters of Russia's Far
East air force "have definitely
joined the Chinese Communist air j
force in flying civil war missions.
The charge followed closely
Chiang Kai-shek's May Day speech
calling the national resistance an
"anti-Communist and anti-Russian
war for national salvation."
(There have been no independent
reports that Russian planes flown
hy Soviet pilots are taking part in
the civil war. Hong Kong's press
has heard, however, that a few Rus
sian jet planes were given to the
Reds.)
