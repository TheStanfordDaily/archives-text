# Color Movie Of Canyons On Series
## 
### 
"Rainbow Canyons of the Colo
rado," a color motion picture of re
mote regions of Utah, Arizona, and
Colorado, will be shown tonight at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium on the
regular Tuesday Evening Series.
The program will be open to the
public without charge.
The film was taken by E. P.
"Husky" Hunt, a member of the
Stanford physical education staff,
who has spent a quarter of a cen
tury exploring and photographing
scenes in the Southwest.
Portions of the moving picture,
shown for the first time to a Stan

1930 and 1940 when Hunt conducted
a party of Palo Alto explorers down
the rapids of the San Juan and
Green rivers.
Also included in the hour-length
film are views of Wayne Wonder
land, Capitol Reef National Monu
ment, Arches National Monument,
Rainbow Bridge, Bryce Canyon,
and the Grand Canyon of the Colo
rado.
Hunt will be introduced by Dr.
Graham Stuart, professor of politi
cal science at Stanford.
