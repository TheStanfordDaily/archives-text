J
A damage suit asking $3,000 from
three Palo Alto police officers was
initiated over the weekend by Niles
Severin, economics major at Stanford,
according to the Palo Alto Times.
Severin was arrested early in April
on charges of disturbing the peace at
a South Palo Alto drive-in. He and
his opponent, Ned Stanley Van Duyne
of Los Altos, were jailed.
The suit charges "false arrest and
imprisonment." It names Police Cap
tain Virgil Carlson, Officers George
Harris and Alba Reese, and two John
Does as defendants. The suit asks
$1,000 damages from each officer.
Severin claims that he is suing the
police officers "because they did not
inform me of the charge against me
when I was arrested, because they did
not allow me to arrange bail, and be
cause they held me in jail for lO'/a
hours before taking me before a
magistrate."
Captain Carlson, who was in charge
of police night detail on the date of
Severin's arrest, declared:
"When Mr. Severin was booked at
police headquarters I informed him
of the charge against him. One of his
friends asked if bail could be set. The
friend and I talked with Mr. Severin,
and I told him he could call Judge
Doyle and ask for bail.
"Mr. Severin stated that he pre
ferred to wait until morning, as he
did not wish to call the judge and
get him out of bed at. that early hour."
