# Berlin Violence Mild
## 
### 
BERLIN â€” Anti - Communists
stoned East Berlin police and tore
down Soviet flags and a loudspeaker
in seething May Day celebrations
today but patient police action on
both sides averted any serious vio
lence.
Berlin boiled with a million cele
brants at rallies on each side of the
border, but the civil war, which
many had feared might explode in
this divided city 100 miles behind
the iron curtain, did not break out.
The closest thing to an incident
was when a Western mob of 5,000
ragged teen-agers pelted 100 blue
uniformed Eastern patrolmen with
brick bats in Potsdamer Platz.
