# Psych Test Discloses Culprits
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
One morning last, week a per
feetly normal looking young man
walked out of the Education Build
ing holding an envelope full of
animal crackers.
lie handed one of the crackers to
the first person he met, then quickly
ate one himself. Using a rubber
band as a slingshot, lie shot the rest
of the cookies at a nearby tree. His
erackcrs gone, he hurried back in
doors.
Inside the building, another
young man was winding a red
string around his toes. Then he
carefully placed a saffron - yellow
paper doll in his shoe, beneath his
heel and his arch. At the same time
still another young man spent three
minutes doing nothing.
Passers-by may have wondered
about their sanity, but in reality

these men were normal students in
Psychology 1)1, taught by Dr. Ernest
R. Ililgard. Their actions were part
of an experiment in detecting guilt
through word association tests.
This experiment, is done each
quarter as a regular part of the
course. When the subjects finish
their assigned tasks, they return to
the classroom and arc tester! one at
a time. They arc forewarned to do
all they can to conceal what they
have done while they were gone.
The instructor reads a list of
words and each student says the
first thing each word brings to
mind. The lists contain key words
like "animal," "slingshot," "saffron,"
and "string," and as the lists arc
read, guilt becomes apparent.
The students reply "cracker" to
"animal" or "string" to red." Occa
sionally they blush and stammer

before making a completely irrele- !
vant, reply to a key word.
The class has been told what j
tasks will be done, and in a vote
taken after all three subjects have
been examined, the class assigns
one of the acts to each person.
Instructors explain that each time i
this experiment is performed, the !
classes correctly guess the culprits. |
Though the subjects are warned to
hide their guilt, the mind takes time
to dismiss the incriminating word
and find a new one to replace it.
Thus a slow, hesitating answer also j
shows guilt.
Experiments like this are typical
of the attempt made in Psych 51 to |
familiarize the students with basic j
psychological techniques. In week- j
1y problem sessions, the students
put their reading and lecture mate- I
rial to actual tests.
