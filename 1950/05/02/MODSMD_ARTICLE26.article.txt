# Respect for Authority

### 
For over 25 years Stanford has had a stu
dent police organization to maintain order at
campus functions. Generally the system has
worked very well to enforce the regulations
necessary to provide the. safety and maximum
of enjoyment for those attending such func
tions.
Recently, however, two incidents have
paused us to wonder if the majority of the stu
dents are particularly interested in either safety
or maximum enjoyment.
1. At the Water Carnival student police as
signed to keep spectators away from the lake
side of the Boathouse were ignored by groups
of self-designated "privileged" students.
The reason for keeping spectators out of this
area seemed pretty obvious to us: to facilitate
the organization of the various Carnival events,
with a minimum chance of accidents, by keep
ing extraneous people away.
2. At the Shipwreck Dance several students

elbowed their way past student police at the
door and proceeded to make the dance un
pleasant for a great many who had paid to at
tend.
Why didn't the student police keep them
out? They tried, but sheer weight of numbers
was against them. It was quite a fight, ending
with the closing of the dance at 12:15.
This doesn't seem to be in the interests of
safety or maximum enjoyment.
These situations bring several possible solu
tions to mind:
1. Hire bigger student police.
2. Hire more student police.
3. Give the present force a course in judo.
4. Hire regular uniformed officers.
Or is it possible that the few who have shown
little respect for the authority of student police,
failing to recognize the necessity that this au
thority be exerted, might "wise up" to those
principles of safety and maximum enjoyment
in the interests or all concerned?
