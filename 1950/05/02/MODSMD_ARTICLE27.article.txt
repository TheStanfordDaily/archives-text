## The 						World of journalism 
### 
At the beginning of each quarter, a number of aspir
ants to journalistic laurels join the stall' of The Stan
ford Daily. Within the cherished walls of The Daily
Office, known in the vernacular as "The Shack," the
budding journalists are taught the fundamentals, of
the role of a journalist and given a glimpse of the world
of journalism.
Journalism is a profession which is totally unlike any
other. For who but a journalist can experience the
feverish haste of a dinner hurried into five minutes
between the murder story that has to be written and
someone's momentous speech? Who but a journalist
can experience the paralyzing fear which accompanies
the roar of an enraged editor? Who but a journalist
can step out of the grave atmosphere of a funeral to
step immediately into the gay rejoicings of a wedding?
Who but a journalist can write a leader on almost any
~t only to be stumped for the want of a suitable
headline?
The prospective journalists .soon learn that a jour
nalist is not merely a writer. He is much more than
that. As the London Times once observed, a jour
nalist, working under the pressure of daily publica
tion, must finish on the stroke ol the clock words which
all the world will be at liberty to criticize on the mor
row. Unlike the writer of mere books, he has no
chance to rewrite or recast. Horace's prudent precept,
saepe stilurri vertas, is not advice that he can follow.

He must write quickly; and what he has has written
may never be retracted or recalled.
In the olden days, journalistic writings tended to be
filled with jargon unintelligible to the layman. Nowa
days journalistic writings have a tendency towards
flippancy and slang. Neither is really desirable.
Though good journalism is intended for the workaday
reader, frequent excursions into the realm of culture
are not barred. Nor is the expression of true wit pro
hibited, for a sense of humor is surely one of the most
desirable qualities of a journalist.
The writing of a journalist are nearly always spon
taneously generated. He captures an inspiration and
gives it form. His words give voice to the joy, the fear,
the hope, and the lamentation of all mankind. He
paints verbal pictures of earthquakes and wars, ship
wrecks and floods, pageantry and pomp. All this he
does amid the roar of the Loom of Time, the printing
press.
Though there is also a cheaper side of journalism—
the sensational, the purely commercial—it must be ad
mitted that journalists are usually of the nobler sort.
It is the journalists of this nobler sort who give jour
nalism its honored name. Few journalists ever regret
having been journalists. And even those who have had
just a glimpse of the world of journalism always re
member it with nostalgic vividness.
