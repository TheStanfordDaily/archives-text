### JOHN HALL 
In honor of May Day and rain, a few of us moved up
El Camino yesterday to try Bing Crosby's latest ef
fort, hiding High," a picture which was made to order
lor old Crozz, but not for anybody else.
As long as Crosby was in the center of things, the

flick was great. Good lines, good
>ongs, strictly Crosby. But where
Mister C left off and the plot took
up, things went from good to bad
to hearse.
For the record, the story was
duplicated from the 1 il34 original,
"Broadway Bill," the tale of a
racehorse making good. It's amaz
ing what 16 years will do to a
■ tory, although Paramount tried
to fool everybody by giving seven
different actors the identical roles

they had played in '34, and turned them all loose under
the same director, Frank Capra.
But it's a lucky thing they had Crosby around to fill
in tor the original hero, Warner Baxter, who must
have kpen patronizing different beauty parlors than
the other seven. Baxter now makes a good crime doc
tor.
The movie had its worst moments during the run
ning of the Imperial Handicap, supposedly the colossal
climax of Capra's struggle. Here, in a race that any
plug could walk off in at least 2 minutes and 10 sec
onds, and that's including a stop gap for gas, the cam
eras kept going for a good 12 minutes.
But maybe it was a good thing that it took that long,
because "Broadway Bill, running his first race (he
threw his jockey the only other time out), just off the

sick list with a high fever, and racing against two of
the finest horses in America today, had to overcome a
crooked jockey (Frankie Darrow, who also played a
crooked jockey in 1934 and in about a thousand other
flicks) to get down to the wire first in the typical head
and-head finish.
That dirty rat Darrow pulled good old Broadway Bill
so far back off the pace that Citation himself would
have given up in despair. But not Bill. He finally got
his tongue over the bit and passed the entire field in a
six-minute stretch drive.
The only thing believable about the race was that
Bill dropped dead immediately after crossing the wire.
He should have dropped dead at the beginning and
saved himself a lot of trouble.
Actually, Crosby was sharp enough to push the
minor details, such as plot, into the background. He
turned in fine renditions of "Bake a Sunshine Cake"
(not to be confused with it contemporaries, "Candy
and Cake," and "If I Knew You Were Coming I'd
Have Baked a Cake"), "We've Got a Sure Thing This
Time," and"The Horse Told Me," as well as being a
convincing horse owner.
Paramount tried hard to pick up a few extra laughs
by shoving Oliver Hardy into a surprise scene as a
hayseed being touted out of his wife's bankroll by
Will Demarest, and placing Max Baer in a tuxedo for
another.
Well, you never can tell. I was amazed to see that
Time Magazine, which has a critic who never likes
anything, wasn't even bothered by the 12-minute
horse race, and rather enjoyed the whole thing. The
only thing I can say is that critic must have seen too
many movies.
See you at Mem Aud Sunday night.

turned in fine renditions of "Bake a Sunshine Cake"
(not to be confused with it contemporaries, "Candy
and Cake," and "If I Knew You Were Coming I'd
Have Baked a Cake"), "We've Got a Sure Thing This
Time," and"The Horse Told Me," as well as being a
convincing horse owner.
Paramount tried hard to pick up a few extra laughs
by shoving Oliver Hardy into a surprise scene as a
hayseed being touted out of his wife's bankroll by
Will Demarest, and placing Max Baer in a tuxedo for
another.
Well, you never can tell. I was amazed to see that
Time Magazine, which has a critic who never likes
anything, wasn't even bothered by the 12-minute
horse race, and rather enjoyed the whole thing. The
only thing I can say is that critic must have seen too
many movies.
See you at Mem Aud Sunday night.

In honor of May Day and rain, a few of us moved up
El Camino yesterday to try Bing Crosby's latest ef
fort, hiding High," a picture which was made to order
lor old Crozz, but not for anybody else.
As long as Crosby was in the center of things, the

flick was great. Good lines, good
>ongs, strictly Crosby. But where
Mister C left off and the plot took
up, things went from good to bad
to hearse.
For the record, the story was
duplicated from the 1 il34 original,
"Broadway Bill," the tale of a
racehorse making good. It's amaz
ing what 16 years will do to a
■ tory, although Paramount tried
to fool everybody by giving seven
different actors the identical roles

they had played in '34, and turned them all loose under
the same director, Frank Capra.
But it's a lucky thing they had Crosby around to fill
in tor the original hero, Warner Baxter, who must
have kpen patronizing different beauty parlors than
the other seven. Baxter now makes a good crime doc
tor.
The movie had its worst moments during the run
ning of the Imperial Handicap, supposedly the colossal
climax of Capra's struggle. Here, in a race that any
plug could walk off in at least 2 minutes and 10 sec
onds, and that's including a stop gap for gas, the cam
eras kept going for a good 12 minutes.
But maybe it was a good thing that it took that long,
because "Broadway Bill, running his first race (he
threw his jockey the only other time out), just off the

sick list with a high fever, and racing against two of
the finest horses in America today, had to overcome a
crooked jockey (Frankie Darrow, who also played a
crooked jockey in 1934 and in about a thousand other
flicks) to get down to the wire first in the typical head
and-head finish.
That dirty rat Darrow pulled good old Broadway Bill
so far back off the pace that Citation himself would
have given up in despair. But not Bill. He finally got
his tongue over the bit and passed the entire field in a
six-minute stretch drive.
The only thing believable about the race was that
Bill dropped dead immediately after crossing the wire.
He should have dropped dead at the beginning and
saved himself a lot of trouble.
Actually, Crosby was sharp enough to push the
minor details, such as plot, into the background. He
turned in fine renditions of "Bake a Sunshine Cake"
(not to be confused with it contemporaries, "Candy
and Cake," and "If I Knew You Were Coming I'd
Have Baked a Cake"), "We've Got a Sure Thing This
Time," and"The Horse Told Me," as well as being a
