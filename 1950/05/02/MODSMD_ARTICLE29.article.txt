## Hosts for Foreign Students 
### 
To the Editor:
Tuesday through Thursday at the Cellar, the Com
mittee for the Host and Hostess Program for Foreign
Students will be signing up all American students in
terested in participating in this work at the beginning
oi next fall quarter.
The American Hosts and Hostesses will each he able
to choose a student newly arriving at Stanford from a
foreign country and to help him during the first days
ol his stay at Stanford. Plunged suddenly into strange
and sometimes even slightly terrifying surroundings,
ueh as Stanford on Registration Day, a foreign stu
dent cannot appreciate anything more, than having a
friendly host show him the ropes and help him get
adjusted to the new customs.
As I myself have benefitted highly from this pro

gram—a most sincere friendship has developed be
tween my former host and myself—and as I have also
been able to see the great amount of help given to
numerous other foreign students and the need of many
more, I would like highly to endorse the work of this
committee.
I believe that the American Hosts and Hostesses, too,
apart from the knowledge and satisfaction of giving
much-needed help, may profit from their experience
by getting to know a foreign student and through him
learning something about other countries and cus
toms. All who are willing to participate by giving a
few hours of their time at the beginning of the quarter
will most certainly gain a great deal, and can be sure
that their friendly assistance will be highly appre
ciated.
