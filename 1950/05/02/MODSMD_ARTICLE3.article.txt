## 
### 
NEW YORKâ€”A possible nation-]
wide telephone tieup was averted |
today only four hours before the
deadline.
Some 10,000 Western Electric in
stallers ended their week-old walk
out and called of! plans to throw
picket lines around strategic tele
phone exchanges throughout the j
country.
The installers had hoped their I
picket lines would have kept about I
230,000 phone workers away from |
their jobs.
But the pickets didn't march. J
Their union negotiators called the J
whole thing ofT after a 15-hour
bargaining session, with federal me- |
diators sitting in.
