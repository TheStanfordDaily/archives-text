# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## RESEARCH DECENTRALIZED 
### 
rpHE du pont company is a large
J company. Its many manufactur
ing plants are now located from
Maine to California. Likewise, the
Company's research activities are
spread over a wide area. From the
Founder's informal scientific experi
ments on the Brandy wine have
sprung 42 research and development
laboratories in ten states.
Each manufacturing department*
has its own research director and
maintains facilities for studies in its
specialized fields. Thus, research hav
ing to do with dyes, neoprene and
fine chemicals is centered at Deep
water, N. J.; research on cellophane
and other transparent wrapping films
at Buffalo, N. Y.; research on viscose
rayon at Richmond, Va.; and re
search on coated and impregnated
fabrics at Newbnrgh, N. Y. These

Du Pont scientists pursue their studies
from Buffalo, N. Y., to Orange, Texas

are only a few of the places where
Du Pont scientists are now at work.
Each manufacturing department
does fundamental research as well as
applied research on new processes
and products.
Many types of training
At any one time, many hundreds of
different projects are under way in
these laboratories. Though a rela
tively large number of Du Pont tech
nical people are chemists and chem
ical engineers, other fields of training
are strongly represented.
Among the scientists working with
Du Pont are mechanical, electrical,
civil, industrial, mining, petroleum,
textile, architectural and safety en
gineers, physicists, metallurgists, bi
ologists and mathematicians. About
30% of I hose men and women who

are engaged in technical activities
at Du Pont hold doctor's degrees.
Interchange of thinking
All manufacturing departments may
draw on the services of the chem
ical, engineering and toxicological
laboratories of the company in Wil
mington. In addition, the Chemical
Department's library at the Wil
mington Experimental Station cir
culates reference material, conducts
literature and patent searches and
issues a weekly abstract of pertinent
articles found in the important chem
ical journals of the world. This sup
plements normal work of this kind
done by the various manufacturing
departments.
No matter where a Du Pont re
search man may work, he has every
opportunity to use his best talents,
to advance as his abilities develop,
and to profit by interchange of think
ing with scientists whose minds com
plement his own.

Artist's drawing of the Marshall Laboratory,
new Do Pont laboratory for research on fin
ishes. Under construction at Philadelphia, It
should be ready for occupancy by late 1950.
rpHE du pont company is a large
J company. Its many manufactur
ing plants are now located from
Maine to California. Likewise, the
Company's research activities are
spread over a wide area. From the
Founder's informal scientific experi
ments on the Brandy wine have
sprung 42 research and development
laboratories in ten states.
Each manufacturing department*
has its own research director and
maintains facilities for studies in its
specialized fields. Thus, research hav
ing to do with dyes, neoprene and
fine chemicals is centered at Deep
water, N. J.; research on cellophane
and other transparent wrapping films
at Buffalo, N. Y.; research on viscose
rayon at Richmond, Va.; and re
search on coated and impregnated
fabrics at Newbnrgh, N. Y. These

Du Pont scientists pursue their studies
from Buffalo, N. Y., to Orange, Texas

are only a few of the places where
Du Pont scientists are now at work.
Each manufacturing department
does fundamental research as well as
applied research on new processes
and products.
Many types of training
At any one time, many hundreds of
different projects are under way in
these laboratories. Though a rela
tively large number of Du Pont tech
nical people are chemists and chem
ical engineers, other fields of training
are strongly represented.
Among the scientists working with
Du Pont are mechanical, electrical,
civil, industrial, mining, petroleum,
textile, architectural and safety en
gineers, physicists, metallurgists, bi
ologists and mathematicians. About
30% of I hose men and women who

are engaged in technical activities
at Du Pont hold doctor's degrees.
Interchange of thinking
All manufacturing departments may
draw on the services of the chem
ical, engineering and toxicological
laboratories of the company in Wil
mington. In addition, the Chemical
Department's library at the Wil
mington Experimental Station cir
culates reference material, conducts
literature and patent searches and
issues a weekly abstract of pertinent
articles found in the important chem
ical journals of the world. This sup
plements normal work of this kind
done by the various manufacturing
departments.
No matter where a Du Pont re
search man may work, he has every
opportunity to use his best talents,
to advance as his abilities develop,
and to profit by interchange of think
ing with scientists whose minds com
plement his own.
