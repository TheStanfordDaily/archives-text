The 1950 track season, as far as dual and home meets are concerned, will
draw to a close Saturday with the Big Meet. From this event the Cards will
move on to the West Coast Relays at Fresno, the Coliseum Relays, and the
Modesto Relays. Then the better members of the squad will join the PCC
Meet at Berkeley on May 27, the PAA at Berkeley on June 3. Alter that
comes the NC2A on June 16-17 at Minnesota and the PCC-Big Nine at Wis
consin on June 21.
So the big events are yet to come. Thus far the season has been a rather
lazy aflair. Two Monday meets, a loss to the best edition of the best in the
world, and a lopsided win over the Haplass Bruin of UCLA have done little
to lire up Joe Fan on the 1950 Indian track team.
Yet on Saturday next the Indians and Bears meet in what promises to be
one of the closest Big Meets in years. Doping the meet strictjy according to
times registered thus far, the Bears will be leading 64 to 62 by the time the
jelay comes around, Stanford will win it and the meet. It says here.
Mulhius Set for Four Event*
But wlu t the true track fan will relish is the propect of seeing the two
best all-around trackmen in the nation in action. We speak oi Bob Mathias
and Gaylord Bryan, of course. Gay will enter five events. If the Cards need
the points badly, and if Gay feels up to it, he will enter the low hurdles to
make it six events.
Mathias will enter four events for certain, with a probable two more. Mark
him up for the discus, high hurdles, shot put, and high jump. He will prob
ably go in the pole vault and one of the other track events to make it six
also.
That's the Stanford side of it. The fellows from across the Bay have a
couple of yearlings who will be the rave men of future years. Jim Plessas
will enter four or five events. He is one of the highest rated preps ever to
enter Cal. Thus far his times and distances have not equalled his high school
marks,- but the kid has it. Note the high school marks —23 ft. 8 in. broad
jump, 9.8 hundred, 21.4 furlong, 48:6 relay lap. He has hit 25.1 in the low
bin dies this year.
Jim Hutchinson, also of the Cal Frosh, will go in the 440, 100, and 220. He
will place in all three.
Norm Jiles of the Stanford Frosh will do a little bit of all right, too. He has
hit 6 ft. 4% in. in the high jump.
Gay Bryan vs. Doiinie Anderson
The age ot Iron Men is here to stay. I doubt if any of these men will hit the
all-around greatness of the Gay one, but the trend lias been started.
But G. Bryan will have his work cut out for him. He will have to come off
four events to meet Donnie Anderson in the 220. Anderson will have run
only one event prior to that, the 100, and will have had over a half hour rest.
Anderson, it will be remembered, placed second to Mel Patton in the NC2A
meet in 1948 in the 100 and 200 meters. He won the PCC sprints the same
year. Last year was a bad one for the Don, but he is back to 9.5 in the 100
and 20.8 in the 220 this year.
But- if it comes up wind in the Stadium tunnel, my pick is G.B. in the 220.
Anderson will be off the blocks first and in the lead for the first 100, but
then it will be all Bryan. It says here.
The broad jump will be a tough 'un for the Gaylord, as he will have to
face 1949 Big Meet winner Rod Grant and Lyle Stainfield, both of whom have
beaten his mark this year. But it is hard to figure a national champion losing
in a dual meet, even if he will be in his fifth event of the day. Bryan—it
iays here.
Still looking for stars. Well, theive will be the nation's No. 1 and 2 javelin
tossers on the field. Bud Held, of course, leads the nation with 233 ft. 4'/i in.
George Hoseme of the Blue has hit 229 ft. 2 in. By the way the No. 3 and 4
spear tossers are Delf Pickarts of Santa Barbara State and Cy Young of
UCLA.
Chandler No. 2 in Nation
Then, too, there will be the No. 2 and No. 3 shotputters on the field. Chan
dler replaced teammate Lew Davis in the No. 2 spot behind Yale's Jim Fucks
on Saturday last. Davis is now third. Both will improve during the next two
months. Chandler is holding back reaching his peak with an eye on theAAU
trip to Europe this summer. He does not want to slide backward in late
season as ho has in years past.
Those are the stars. But the fellows who will make or break the Cards
are such as A 1 Lyons, John Wooley, Woody Bray, and Joss Scroggy. Coach
Jack Weiershauser will have to parlay these four men to get the most points
in the mile, two-mile, and 880. Bray and Scroggy will have to stick with the
hB<). Just which race Lyons will enter is doubtful at this time. Neither Lyons
nor Wooley has shfown that he can double up. And this is Cal's strongest
position. A second and third in the six places will be welcome.
Then there are Jack Burke and Frank Bradley in the discus. Either of these
men could take a first. Cross your fingers and pray for a first and second.
Bill Storum has earned himself a position on the relay team off his 50.1
relay lap. Cass Bly, Pitch Johnson are sure entries here, but the fourth man
is as yet undetermined. It could be Wilbur Taylor, Stan Dawson, or the
ailing Larry Hoff.
DISA AND DATA—It is a99to 1 bet that the Card baseball team will not
go to Hawaii this year. The Islands are going to host a Japanese team instead.
Jack Weiershauser warns the fellow who stole the .32 from the Stadium
Fefd House not to fire regular shells in it. It is meant only for firing blanks.
Methinks the guy should be left to find out for himself. (The pistol will ex
plode if fired with a regular shell).—The 440 race is run around two turns
in the home meets because the NC2A event will be so run this year. The
national event will have lanes all th way, though.—7,ooo are expected for the
meet this Saturday. The highest mark for a Big Meet is 17,000. —The orders
have gone out to the corp yard to put backstops pn the softfcall diamonds;
also, the diamonds will be dragged and the poloists warned to keep to their
field and not cut up the diamonds are they have in the past. So went the
orders, now what will happen? —It has been a good spring on the Farm.
The baseballers lead the league for the first time in 19 years, the swimming,
golf, and track teams have lost but once, and the tennisers but twice. The
lootball team wins every Saturday morning as regular as clockwork, and
Stanford will have the "best line since the war." It says here. «
