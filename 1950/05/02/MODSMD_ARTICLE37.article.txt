# Hall's PCL Baseball Roundup
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Pants Rowland's triple-A base
ball players, receiving their pay
from the Pacific Coast's eight larg
est cities, figure to be right on
schedule tonight to start the sixth
week of PCL baseball.
Weather permitting, Seals Sta
dium up the road apiece will be
the site of the week's most impor
tant get-together, as the dauntless
O'Douls defend their present third
place niche against the fast-climb
ing Los Angeles Angels. First pitch

this evening is set for the usual 8:15.
The Smog City boys polished off
San Diego (4-3) and Hollywood (5-
2) in consecutive series, and are
currently batting the hosshide with
as much efficiency as the league
leading Potent Pads, who last week
rode out Seattle for a 7-0 count to
glide by sliding Hollywood.
Meanwhile, the Seals have been
having a pretty good time them
selves, putting the boot to the hated
Opks last week to stay IV2 tilts
ahead of LA.
