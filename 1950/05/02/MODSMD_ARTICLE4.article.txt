# Lattimore Inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Ex-Commu
nist Freda Utley testified today she
has no proof that Owen Lattimore
ever joined the Communist party,
but said his writings since 1938 il
lustrated "his subservience to Com
munist party discipline."
The 52-year-old witness, a former
member of the British Communist
party, told a Senate investigating
committee that the actions of both
Lattimore and his wife were "indis
tinguishable" from those of a Com
munist.
"Knowingly or not," Mrs. Utley
said. "Lattimore has been assigned
to an important role in the Commu
nist plot."
