# Return on Rebates Is Still Indefinite
## 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore will not
necessarily pay a 20 per cent rebate,
as reported Friday in The Daily. Re
bates will be paid, but the percentage
varies with the number of slips
turned in by Bookstore customers.
For the past two years the Book
store has paid 20 per cent of face
value on all receipts turned in. How
ever, if more people take advantage
of their privilege to collect rebates
this year, the percentage will be
smaller; if fewer do, the percentage
will be larger.
The Bookstore is an independent
co-operative store which pays re
bates to all customers connected with
the University.
Rebate slips are due at the Book
store now and until May 15, after
which none will be accepted.
