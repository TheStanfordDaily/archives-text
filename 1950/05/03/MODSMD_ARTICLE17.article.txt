# Farm Prof Says 'Hands Off' Road
## 
### 
Stanford's professor - novelist
Wallace Stegner gave the Santa
Clara Board of Supervisors a big
jolt Monday when he asked that a
road near his home in Los Altos be
left unpaved.
The supervisors, long used to
hearing that roads "must" be
paved, heard a letter from Steg
ner suggesting that South Elena
avenue be prepared as a bridle
path if it is to be paved at all.
Stegner said that the lane was not
sufficiently used to warrant paving.
County Surveyor Robert B.
Chandler said that many of the
persons who found themselves
mired in the road last winter prob
ably would not agree with the
Stanford professor.
