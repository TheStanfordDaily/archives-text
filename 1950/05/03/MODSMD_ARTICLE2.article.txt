Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur, for the
sccond time in 10 months, suggested
yesterday the possibility of outlaw
ing the Communist party in Japan.
On the third anniversary of Ja
pan's "no war" constitution, the
American commander said the
country's Communist party was an
"avowed satellite of an international
predatory force and a Japanese
pawn of alien power policy."
The same question is being raised
in the Union of South Africa where
Justice Minister C. R. Swart dis
closed that a night of terror grow
ing out of an attempted May Day
strike in Johannesburg led to the
death of 18 Negroes and the wound
ing of more than 30 others in
clashes with police.
