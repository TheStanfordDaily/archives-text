# The 						Sign Said 'No Smoking'

### 
"No Smoking" the sign said, and 25 feet
away the student lit up a cigarette and glanced
over his history test questions. "Sign the
Honor Code and observe tfie no smoking rule,"
the test said, and the student took a long drag
and signed his name on the proper line.
The repeated unwillingness of students to
comply with no smoking regulations in the aca ;
dernic buildings was brought to The Daily's
attention recently by a professor who was
somewhat irked at continually having to re
mind the students of the rule. It was again
brought to our attention a couple of days ago
when we tried to cipher a complex test ques
tion while enveloped in clouds of tobacco
smoke coming from the row behind.
Smoking in "No Smoking" areas is a direct
violation of the Fundamental Standard. Should

this fail to impress the cynics, let us also say
that it is a violation of regulations set down by
the Board of Fire Underwriters who establish
fire insurance standards. In easy-to-understand
words, smoking in classrooms is illegal.
Previous reminders on the part of the fire
chief, the professors, and The Daily seem to
have failed. It is evidently necessary to deal
st.ictly with future offenders. We would like
to see the fire chief recommend that faculty
members and students report all violations to
the proper student judicial council. Offenders
should be punished by the councils on the
basis of violating the Fundamental Standard
and given reasonably heavy sentences. It
seems that this is the only way to make a "No
Smoking" sign more effective than a wall deco
ration.—A.M.
