### JOHN BODNAR 
Nov/ the story can be told. It happened one balmy
summer evening when the railroad tycoon came home
from a hard day's "work of building raliroads, switch
trains, or whatever it is that railroad tycoons do.
He walked into the study, sat down in his favorite
chair and started to unlace his shoes. He looked about
for his slippers. As he looked up his wife came into
the study.
"Have you seen my slippers, dear?" he asked her.
"Aren't they here? I thought surely Charles had
brought them in." Charles was the butler.
"Well, he hasn't."
His wife brought him the evening paper and opened
it to the financial page. The railroad tycoon's eyebrow
rose i:t this unusual gesture. He settled back and
began to peruse it.
"Darling," his wife said softly, as she brushed a
piece of lint from his suit.
"Yes, dear," he answered in the mechanical man
ner that husbands have when they don't particularly
want to listen.
"Oh, it's nothing. You'd just laugh at me." She dis
missed the subject.
"What did you say, dear?"
"You weren't even listening," she said.
"Of course I was." He continued to read the paper.
"What are we having for dinner tonight?"
"Your favorite dish, dear."
"Welsh rarebit, he said in a comfortable-sounding
tone. "If I only had my slippers. Confound that
Charles. Maybe we should dismiss him."
"I'm sure it just slipped his mind," ;,he answered
quickly.
"Well, maybe." He grunted as his eyes ran down
the list of figures.
"Dear," she said softly. "You know Wilber's wife
has a new carriage."
'She has an inordinate fondness for carriages." He
looked over at her. "Do we need a new carriage?" he
asked.
"No, no. I thought you'd like to know." She paused
a moment and then continued: "George bought his

wife a brand new yacht."
"Yacht? iWhat does she want with a yacht?" he
asked.
"I don't know. I was just thinking that I hardly
ever get anything new." She looked thoughtfully to
ward the fireplace.
The railroad tycoon let the paper fall into his lap.
"If you want a new carriage or a yacht, why go ahead
and buy it. You know that you can have whatever
you want.
She stood up and walked over to the window. "Oh,
I don't want any silly old carriages or yachts." She
looked out of the window, a look of remorse on her
face. "These are all such inane things to want."
"Then just what is it you want?"
"You'd laugh at me."
"Out with it, woman."
"Well," she paused strategically. "It's just that I'd
like to build a university."
"A university!" the tycoon screeched as he jumped
up from his chair. "Money doesn't grow on trees. I
work hard for what I get. A university, indeed."
His wife began to cry, quietly but effectively. "I
really should have kept this foolish hope to myself.
I'm sorry now that I mentioned it."
"There's no need to carry on like this," he said,
trying to comfort her.
"1 try to be a good wife, but I'm just not appre
ciated."
"You know that that's not true. It's just that a uni
versityâ€”well, it's just too expensive."
Now she had but her one final weapon. "You don't
love me any more." She threw herself down on the
silver embossed settee.
"1 do. You know I do." He walked over to the fire
place and stood in thought for a moment. "All right,
you can have your university."
Her eyes immediately brightened and the tears dis
appeared. She summoned Charles who then brought
in the slippers. Peace reigned once again in that do
mestic domain.
And so a university was born.
