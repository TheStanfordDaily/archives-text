Development of a new type of
barium suspension which results in
dearer X-ray films of the stomach
and intestinal tract was reported to
the Calfiornia Medical Association
late yesterday by a team of Stanford
University medical scientists.
The barium, suspended in a col
loidal mixture rather than in water
alone as has been the practice for
i oine .30 years, produces startlingly
.sharp X-ray films which show mi
nute details of the stomach and in
testines.
The three Medical School faculty
members, Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, Dr.
Henry Jones, and Dr. Frank Wind
holz, all of the University's De
partment of Radiology, reported
one instance in which the new tech
nique demonstrated pre-eancerous
polyps of the colon as small as four
millimeters in diameter.
The research of the three medical
scientists is an outgrowth of earlier
work done by the late Dr. Wind
holz.
The report covered 200 cases at
Stanford Hospital. Half of these pa
tients received the old barium and
water and half the colloidal barium.
