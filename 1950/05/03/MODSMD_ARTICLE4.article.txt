NEW YORK. May 2 (/P)â€”Alger j
Hiss, convicted perjurer and one- j
time top State Department official,
today lost his right to practice law j
in New York State.
The action stemmed from a fed- !
eral court jury verdict last January
which found him guilty of swearing
falsely that he did not feed U.S. se
crets to Whittaker Chambers, cx-
Communist courier for a pre-war i
Russian spy ring.
Hiss said he had "no comment to
make" on the action. He now is
free of bail, pending appeal of the
conviction. He was sentenced to
five years in prison.
