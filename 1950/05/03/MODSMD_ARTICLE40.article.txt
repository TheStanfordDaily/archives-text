# Indian Nine Drops Tilt With Bulldogs
## 
### 
S t a n 112 or d's varsity baseballers ,
dropped a 5 to 3 nonconference de
cision to Fresno State on the Sunk
en Diamond yesterday afternoon,
but at the same time picked up an
other half-game on the rest of the
CIBA as lowly UCLA obliged by
taking the measure fo second-place
USC, 7 to (>, in 12 innings down at
West wood.
The loss lowered the Trojans to a
4-and-4 season record, and dropped
them into a three-way tie for sec
ond place, one and a half games
behind the flying Indians. •
The Cards are now in the driver's
seat as far as the CIBA race goes,
but they must beat Cal Saturday
and gain at least a split out of their
two - game series with USC two
weeks hence to stay there.
Yesterday's loss to Fresno State j
proved nothing except (1) it would
have been better if the rains had
come earlier, and (2) the Cards had
better sharpen their "clutch hit"
baiting eyes before they meet Cal
Saturday.
Hog Osenbaugh started inauspi
ciously on the mound for Stanford
yesterday and lasted until the third j
inning before giving way to Dave j

Stott. Osenbaugh gave up two runs
and put two more on base to be
charged with the loss.
The final Fresno run came off Joe
Chez, who finished up after taking
over in teh seventh. It was the first
home appearance for Joe, who has
won five and lost none for the In
dians in foreign parks.
The Cards had plenty of men on
base, but just couldn't bring them
around. Bud Klein and Dave Mel
ton hit successive doubles for a sin
gle run in the ninth, but the rally
died there.
Klein led the Cards at the plate
with a single and a double.
The line score:
Fresno State.. 202 <100 001—5 8 2
Stanford 000 011 001—3 8 1
Harnett, Welton (3), and Alt
bolt; Osenbaugh, Stott (3), Chez
I (7), and Corzine.
