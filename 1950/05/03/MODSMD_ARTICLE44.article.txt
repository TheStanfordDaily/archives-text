# The 						Cox'n at the Helm is Mainstay of Crewmen

Ready all, row!
With this coxswain's command,
Stanford's varsity shell glides for
ward through Palo Alto Yacht Har
bor's waters in preparation for Sat
urday's race with California's var
sity crew. The speed and ease of
Stanford's crew is due to many fac
tors.
Primarily there is a boat, or a
shell as it is called, which weighs
close to 250 pounds and in length
approaches 65 feet. The thickness
of the boat is only one-sixteenth of
an inch, therefor accounting for the
speed and lightness of such a long
boat.
Into this long, thin, sleek shell go
nine men â€” eight oarsmen and a
coxsv/ain. In Sanford's varsity boat,
the average height of the oarsmen is
6 feet 3 inches and the average
weight is 185 pounds. The duty of
an individual oarsman is to handle
one 12-foot oar and to do so in such
; a manner as to be in rhythm with
the other seven. Although the oars
men sit directly behind one another,
they operate alternate oars. In oth
er words, there are four oars and
the starboard side and four on the
port side of the shell.
Cox'n Dead Weight
The oarsmen sit on sliding seats
which move nearly 30 inches with
1 each stroke, allowing the oarsmen
J to put their body weight as well as
leg and arm power into each stroke.
This is essential because each oars
man must move his own weight
p!us one - eighth the coxswain's
weight plus one-eighth the shell's
weight or a total of about 225
| pounds.
The nerve center of the shell is
the ccbcswain, whose job it is to steer
the boat, keep the crew informed as
to position, and correct any mis
lakes they may be making. Stan
ford's first boat has as coxswain
Dave Hcrdman. A small, light cox
i swain is essential because actually
lie is "dead weight," and Herdman
fills the bill, being ony 5 feet 4
inches tall and weighing 105 pounds.
Coach Jim Beggs, former Yale cox
swain, predicts that Herdman will
develop into one of the Coast's fin-
I est coxswains because of his inspi
! rational force and spirit.
No Individual (ilory
Crew is the most complete team
I sport of any. No crew member
wants recognition, because the only
time an oarsman is noticed is when
lie "catches a crab," or upsets the
rhythm of the shell. Power plays an
important part in the propulsion of

a boat, but misused power can be
obviously dangerous.
The subject of strokes is an im
portant one. Strokes per minute
are the number of times the blade
of the oar threads the water each
minute.
In a three-mile race, such as the
one to be held Saturday, the shell
starts at a racing start of 40 strokes
per minute, but only for the first 15
strokes. The strokes then drop to a
32 or a 34 and that pace continues
until the finish when the stroke is
increased, possibly to a 40, depend
ing on the necessity. An oarsman
who serves as stroke shouts out the
count to the crew. A three-mile
race consists of 480 strokes, and a
shell's speed reaches about 12 miles
per hour during the 15-minute race.
Style plays an important part in
crew, and the fundamental Stanford
style consists of a fast drive and a
long recovery. That is, the oar blade
is in the water for three counts and
the recovery is six counts.
Mental Attitude Important
According to Coach Beggs and
Freshman Coach Lou Lindsey,
mental attitude plays an important
part in a winning crew. Dick Porter
has proved what determination can
do. Last year when he first report
ed for crew he was advised to be
come manager because he was
"only" 5 feet 10 inches, but through
hard work he is now in Stanord's
first boat, together with Arend
Horstmeyer, Bill Meyer, Jay Niblo,
Don Craven, Ray Atkinson, Dick
Oakley, stroke Jim Fier, and cox
swain Dave Herdman.
