## 
### 
Held clown by the three-hit pitch
ing of Mike Zinck, not to mention |
a few well - distributed raindrops,
Kappa Alpha II succumbed to a
red-hot Theta Chi II nine in a
three-inning game yesterday after
noon by an 11 to 3 count. The high
lights of the game came when the
KA's Dick Hall and Ben Brahler
smashed a round-tripper apiece to i
lead a futile rally for their house in
the third frame.
To complete a perfect day for
Theta Chi, their first team smashed
Alpha Sig I, 16 to 2. Willie Altus,
pitching for the winners, allowed
only two hits The game was I
cinched for the Theta Chi softball- j
ers when Don Fix, Bob Ames, and
Larry Fink all drove homers out
into the fields to top off an impres
sive performance.
Another hard - fought fracas oc
curred when Encina 2E maintained
its undefeated status by downing
2W, 5 to 2. The game began well
for 2W, who put down the first six
from the third inning on, it was all
men who stepped to the plate, but
the 2-Easters' game as they put one
after another of 2W hurfer Bill
Gonser's pitches into the outfield.
