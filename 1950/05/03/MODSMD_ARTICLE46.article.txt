# Oarsmen Prep For Col Meet Saturday
## 
### 
With their big race only three
days away, Stanford's crews have j
been going all out this last week to |
prepare themselves for their coming
struggle.
Working mostly on fine points, j
such as spacing and checking, the |
oarsmen are winding up their prac- :
tice sessions with time trials on the j
Oakland Estuary yesterday, today,
and tomorrow. Their last practice j
will be a light drill in Cal's waters
on Friday afternoon.
The Indian shells were trucked up
to the UC boathouse Monday to en- |
able Coaches Jim Beggs and Lou |
Lindsey to conduct their final {
workouts on the race course.
Five shells will participate in the 1
weekend's work, with the 2-to-4
Saturday afternoon races finding j
the first, sccond, and third varsity '
and two frosh shells attempting to
upset the highly favored Bears.
The lrosh oar-benders have dis
played a great deal of enthusiasm in
their recent workouts. According to
Lou Lindsey, the l'reshm anmentor,
their chances for winning Saturday
arc very good. Says Coach Lindsey,
"In all the four years that I've been

coaching here, this is the first time |
we've really been ready for Cal."
