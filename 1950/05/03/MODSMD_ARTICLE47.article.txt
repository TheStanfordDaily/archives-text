## Frosh Vie With Sequoia High 
### 
Stanford's frosh baseball team
will be out for sweet revenge when
it encounters Sequoia High School
on the frosh diamond at 3:15 this
i afternoon.
The Cardbabes' scheduled game
with San Jose yesterday was in
definitely canceled due to wet
: weather.
The frosh were turned back by
Sequoia, 3 to 2, in the initial game
of the season, and so wil lhave add
i ed incentive to win this afternoon.
The Sequoia tilt will be a warm
up for the California game on Sat
urday. The Papooses have a victory
skein of four straight and will
throw Ron Boyer against Sequoia in
an attempt to make it five.
