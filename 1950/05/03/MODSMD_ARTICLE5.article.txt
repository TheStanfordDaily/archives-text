WASHINGTON â€”In a new plea
for extension of the draft act. Gen.
Omar N. Bradley said today that j
recent world events add up to "a [
very bad situation."
The chairman of the U.S. joint ,
chiefs of staff added that he hoped
no one would consider him guilty i
of war mongcring, because he was '
just "summing up what has been |
said in the newspapers."
He referred, among other things,
to the U.S. charge that Soviet fight
ers shot down an unarmed Ameri
can patrol plane over the open Bal
tic, and to the onward march of i
Communism in the Far East.
He was the first witness as the
House committee opened hearings
on prolonging the life of the Selec
tive Service Act, now due to expire
June 24.
