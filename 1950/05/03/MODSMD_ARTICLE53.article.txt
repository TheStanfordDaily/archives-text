HERE'S SAM McDONALD, self-styled "father" of the Con Home kids since they first started com
ing to the Farm in the summer of 1917, surrounded by a group of his proteges. Sam says he often
forgets their names, but somehow they never forget his. Do you wonder why? Today has been
named "Sam McDonald Day" in honor of his contribution to Stanford and the Con Home.
