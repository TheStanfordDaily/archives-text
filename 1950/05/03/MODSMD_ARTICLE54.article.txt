# Con Home Kids Idolize Sam
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
There's one man the tots will
never forget.
Barbecues, victory gardens, af
ternoon movie parties—all would be
insignificant "little" things were it
not for the smiling - faced Negro
gentleman who has made them so
real to hundreds of needy kids out
at the Con Home.
One day out of the year—today—
has been set aside to honor Sam
McDonald, the man who has been
worshipped by the tots ever since
their first junket to the healthful
Stanford Farm in the summer of
1917.
Sixty-six Years Old
At 66, "Sam," as he is known to
so many alums who remember him
"way back when," is still going
strong. Right now he's planning an
all-redwood miniature grove for the
kids, complete with one of his fa
mous barbecue pits.
Sam says it will be finished and
x-eady to go in two months—as soon
as he gets the time to bring some
of the props down from his 400-acre
home in the redwoods near La
Honda.
Officially titled "Superintendent
of Athletic Buildings and Grounds,"
Sam McDonald came to Stanford in
1903 as a teamster and has been
here ever since.
"Almost got a job with the Navy
at Puget Sound in 1907," Sam re

counts, "but after being made su
perintendent, I found I liked Stan
ford too much for that."
In '07 he began making a name
for himself, and today that name
has become a cherished part of the
memories of thousands of alums
and friends of Stanford who have
known him and worked with him.
For years, these same alums and
friends have been sending their
children in to meet Sam, and, as a
result of his contacts with them, he
has been made lifetime president
of the "Sons and Daughters of Stan
ford Alumni."
"Right now," Sam says, "our
membership numbers over 700." A
barbecue and meeting of the organ
ization was held three years ago,
Sam recalled, and another one is
planned sometime in the future.
Will Write a B?>ok or Two
As a matter of fact, Sam has so
much to tell about his days at Stan
ford and the people he has known
that he has decided to write a book
about it—"two books, I think." says
Sam, "there's so much to tell
about!"

Sam doesn't know when the idea
for the books originated—nor when
they'll be finished. "After all, I'm
not a writer," he admits.
Chief among Mr. McDonald's
many accomplishments, which in
clude his nationally recognized abil
ity at turf-iending and track build
ing, is his knack of barbecuing.
"One month I officiated at 14 bar
becues," Sam smiles, "but nowadays
I just can't afford to do so many."
