# Law Grads Practice In Sham Trials
## 
### 
Monday through Friday next
week, 20 second - year Law School
students will participate in the pre
liminary rounds of the regular com
petition in the Stanford Moot Court
of Appeals.
Beginning at 8:15 nightly in the
Moot Court room of the new Law
School, the arguments will be held
to determine the 12 semi-finalists in
the competition. The public is in
vited to attend the hearings.
To Argue Three Cases
Three problems have been set up
for the lawyers to argue. Two are
concerned with laws affecting racial
problems which may or may not be
constitutional according to the 14th
amendment of the federal constitu
tion.
The third hypothetical case deals
with the suggested unconstitution
ality of a revised state homestead
exemption law, and its effect on
contracts made before the revision.
Acting as judges for the argu
ments will be attorneys from San
Francisco and Palo Alto, four mem
bers of the Law School faculty, and
six third-year law students. Three
judges will preside each night.
Those 12 contestants who survive
the preliminary rounds of the com
petition will engage next fall in the
semi-finals. Four will be selected
from the semi-finals to compete in
the finals next winter quarter.
Cash Prizes Awarded
After the final round, the win
ning competitor will receive $100;
the runner-up, $50; and the remain
ing two finalists, $25 each. Also, the
winner and runner-up will repre
sent Stanford in an Inter - Law
School Moot Court Competition
against Cal and Santa Clara. This
year Stanford won that competition.
The purpose of the Moot Court
program is to develop skill in the
art of legal argumentation through
experience in handling cases under
actual courtroom conditions.
Moot Court competition is extra
curricular activity for the Law
School students, and no credit is
given for participation.
In charge of drafting the problems
for the competition and making all
arrangements is the Moot Court
Board. Headed by Clifford Duke,
the board is composed of Duke,
Lewis Fcnton, Dudley Goul, Armen
Hampar, David Lennihan, Elton
Martin, and Dick Outcault.
