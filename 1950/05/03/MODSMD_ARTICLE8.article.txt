# Lattimore Assails McCarthy 'Fraud'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 2 (AP) — Owen Lattimore today de
nounced his accuser, Republican Senator McCarthy of Wisconsin,
as a man who has "disgraced his party and the people of his state
and the nation."
In a 15,000-word statement, punctuated by angry shouts and his

fist banging the table, Lattimore de
manded that a Senate investigating
committee return a verdict notifying
McCarthy that he had been "caught
out in his fraud and deceit."
Once again Lattimore bitterly de
nied McCarthy's charges that he is a
Communist and the No. 1 Soviet spy
in the United States.
Lattimore called the senator
"clearly a bad policy risk" in the
light of his background.
"My life and works speak for
themselves," Lattimore said. "I have
never been accused, as McCarthy has
been, of income tax evasion, of the
destruction of records that were in
my official custody, or of improperly
using an official position for the pur
pose of advancing my own fortunes,
political or otherwise."
As for cx-Communist leader Louis
F. Budenz, who swore that Latti
more was a member of a "Communist
cell" and helped betray China to Red
conquest, Lattimore said:
"Hogwash — the product of a
twisted and malignant personality!"
Lattimore said in reply to a ques
tion:
"The Communist party has prac
tically no roots in American political
life. It is made up, for the most part,
of an extraordinary collection of mis
fits, crackpots, and generally dis
contented people."
He attacked Budenz, who quit the
Communist Party in 1945, as "either
a plain old-fashioned liar or a patho
logical liar."
Lattimore told the committee:
"In some of its twists and turns,
the Communist line at times coin
cided with the course I was follow
ing, just as for a time it coincided
with the program of the American
and British governments in the war
against Hitler."
Lattimore scoffed at yesterday's
testimony by ex-Communist Freda
Utley that if he isn't a Communist he
acts like one, and that his writings
since 1938 showed his "subservience
to Communist Party discipline."
Lattimore said Mrs. Utley's own
writings could be taken to build up a
strong case that she was still follow
ing the Communist Party line.

As for cx-Communist leader Louis
F. Budenz, who swore that Latti
more was a member of a "Communist
cell" and helped betray China to Red
conquest, Lattimore said:
"Hogwash — the product of a
twisted and malignant personality!"
Lattimore said in reply to a ques
tion:
"The Communist party has prac
tically no roots in American political
life. It is made up, for the most part,
of an extraordinary collection of mis
fits, crackpots, and generally dis
contented people."
He attacked Budenz, who quit the
Communist Party in 1945, as "either
a plain old-fashioned liar or a patho
logical liar."
Lattimore told the committee:
"In some of its twists and turns,
the Communist line at times coin
cided with the course I was follow
ing, just as for a time it coincided
with the program of the American
and British governments in the war
against Hitler."
Lattimore scoffed at yesterday's
testimony by ex-Communist Freda
Utley that if he isn't a Communist he
acts like one, and that his writings
since 1938 showed his "subservience
to Communist Party discipline."
Lattimore said Mrs. Utley's own
writings could be taken to build up a
strong case that she was still follow
ing the Communist Party line.
