# Excom Puts Charities To Poll of 800
## 
### 
By GORDON ADDISON
Eight hundred Stanford stu
dents will be receiving ques
tionnaire cards from Excom
within the next week. Their
answers will help in the evalu
ation of the charity drives which
have so often run the gauntlet
of gotting Excom approval.
Excom last night heard the re
port of Kay Wold and Derek Bok,
who explained the final plans for
conducting the poll. The 800 stu
dents, who arc to be picked at ran
dom, will be asked how much
money they think should go to each
of the various charity drives from
the ASSU budget.
Based on six specific drives to be
listed on the postal cards, Bok said
a report would be ready for Excom
within three weeks.
The burden of conducting the poll
has been shifted to Bok and Miss
Wold following refusal by Cardinals
and NSA to carry out the project.
Not Clear Yet
After three weeks of tossing
around the by-law specifying the
organization of the Fundamental
Standard Standing Committee, Ex
com again voted to table the pro
posal until the by-law could be
clarified still further.
Jan O'Brien and Ted Henshaw
presented the by-law.
An election by-law was passed
which states that any defacement
of Hie Daily in conjunction with
an election "shall constitute illegal
electioneering."
The review of the spring elec
tions, which was scheduled for last
night, was tabled until next week.
The Intercol'egiate Charity Show,
originally scheduled for May 26 and
27, has been canceled this year be
cause San Jose State withdrew its
$800 contribution. The $1,000 ap
propriated several weeks ago from
the Ram's Head account, to help
finance the show, will be returned
to Ram's Head.
Excom also approved the consti
tution of the Village Film Society.
Interviewing Committee
Excom members Fred TenEyck
and Kay Wold were named to join
ASSU President-elect Ted Buttner
on the committee interviewing ap
plicants for summer positions on
Excom.
The latter part of the meeting
turned into a frosh - soph debate
over "Resolved, that the freshman
class should be allowed to hold a
closed street dance on the evening
of May 13."
Sophomores Bud Nutting and
Wayne Alley, speaking loudly for
the negative, said they feared the
dance would endanger the success
of the Soph Cotillion, scheduled for
the same night in San Francisco.
Dick Weisman and Jim Dodd in
sisted that their dance would make
a necessary and "fitting climax" to
the frosh exchange day activities
with Cal.
Adding the mature touch, gradu
ate representative Rex Johnson said
that since there had been a con
certed cfTort this year to encourgae
on-campus social activities, it might
be a qood idea to applaud the fresh
men's efforts by accepting their
date.
v The verdict was for the freshmen.
The sophs withdrew to a heated
ticket-selling campaign.

originally scheduled for May 26 and
27, has been canceled this year be
cause San Jose State withdrew its
$800 contribution. The $1,000 ap
propriated several weeks ago from
the Ram's Head account, to help
finance the show, will be returned
to Ram's Head.
Excom also approved the consti
tution of the Village Film Society.
Interviewing Committee
Excom members Fred TenEyck
and Kay Wold were named to join
ASSU President-elect Ted Buttner
on the committee interviewing ap
plicants for summer positions on
Excom.
The latter part of the meeting
turned into a frosh - soph debate
over "Resolved, that the freshman
class should be allowed to hold a
closed street dance on the evening
of May 13."
Sophomores Bud Nutting and
Wayne Alley, speaking loudly for
the negative, said they feared the
dance would endanger the success
of the Soph Cotillion, scheduled for
the same night in San Francisco.
Dick Weisman and Jim Dodd in
sisted that their dance would make
a necessary and "fitting climax" to
the frosh exchange day activities
with Cal.
Adding the mature touch, gradu
ate representative Rex Johnson said
that since there had been a con
certed cfTort this year to encourgae
on-campus social activities, it might
be a qood idea to applaud the fresh
men's efforts by accepting their
date.
v The verdict was for the freshmen.
The sophs withdrew to a heated
ticket-selling campaign.

Eight hundred Stanford stu
dents will be receiving ques
tionnaire cards from Excom
within the next week. Their
answers will help in the evalu
ation of the charity drives which
have so often run the gauntlet
of gotting Excom approval.
Excom last night heard the re
port of Kay Wold and Derek Bok,
who explained the final plans for
conducting the poll. The 800 stu
dents, who arc to be picked at ran
dom, will be asked how much
money they think should go to each
of the various charity drives from
the ASSU budget.
Based on six specific drives to be
listed on the postal cards, Bok said
a report would be ready for Excom
within three weeks.
The burden of conducting the poll
has been shifted to Bok and Miss
Wold following refusal by Cardinals
and NSA to carry out the project.
Not Clear Yet
After three weeks of tossing
around the by-law specifying the
organization of the Fundamental
Standard Standing Committee, Ex
com again voted to table the pro
posal until the by-law could be
clarified still further.
Jan O'Brien and Ted Henshaw
presented the by-law.
An election by-law was passed
which states that any defacement
of Hie Daily in conjunction with
an election "shall constitute illegal
electioneering."
The review of the spring elec
tions, which was scheduled for last
night, was tabled until next week.
