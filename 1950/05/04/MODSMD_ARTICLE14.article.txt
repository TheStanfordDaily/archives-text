"Branner, where our daddies used
to live," says an old Branner song.
Since 1!)42 there has been no
trace of the masculine flavor which
once permeated Branner Hall.
None, that is, except for the Stan
ford roughs who fill the lobby.
Though it is not as sumptuously
decorated as many of the houses
built expressly for the women,
Branner has an attractive, red
draped lobby and ample living
space. The 180 women are housed
in suites of two rooms accommodat
ing three persons, with a few singles
at the ends of corridors.
Meals arc served three times daily
and twice Sunday in the hall's large
dining room. Both early and late
breakfasts and lunches are served
cafeteria style. Dinner is served at
the tables.
Conveniences of the hall include

two new Bendixes, the "Hole (a
store which sells food and toilet ar
ticles), laundry and cleaning serv
ice, laundry and drying rooms, and
ironing hoards. Pride and joy of •he
hail is its newly added study room
and library which provides a quiet
place to study "away from it all."
Branner's women arc helped by a
resident director, two RA s, a
housekeeper, dining hall director
and staff, maids who clean the
rooms once a week, and many eth
ers.
Government of tlv 1 hall is han
dled through the Branner Women';;
Club, to which all girls pay $3 due .
The dues help pay for corridor
spreads, all - hall spreads, dances,
after-dinner coffees, and other
events. Officers are elected by the
hall twice a year.
A scholarship is given each year
to a needy girl in the hall. The
money for this is raised by the cii'ls
through their annual fashion show,
bridge tournaments, and selling ice
cream and sandwiches.
Women from all classes and all
parts of the country and included in

Branner's heterogeneous population.
Transfers from other colleges, the
| freshman overflow from Roble, scv
eral sponsors, and the girls who
have drawn in — all contribute to the
friendly atmosphere of a hall where
it is a common occurrence to find
women from the same home town,
part of the country, or school, or
who have common acquaintances.
Branner girls have a friendly rc
lationship with the nearby men's
halls. Firesides, volleyball games,
and exchanges are some of the in
formal get-togethers between these
groups.
/V commonly supposed disadvan
tage to this hall is its distance from
Quad. However, it is only about a
five-minute walk to the Engineer
ing corner, and the History corner
| can be reached by a short cut tak
ing seven minutes.
Margaret Gairdner, president of
the hall, comments on living at
Branner by saying, "There is a
spirit among Branner girls which
makes us feel that combining all
classes in one hall is a good idea.
And it is reported that Branner food
is the best on campus."

Margaret Gairdner, president of
the hall, comments on living at
Branner by saying, "There is a
spirit among Branner girls which
makes us feel that combining all
classes in one hall is a good idea.
And it is reported that Branner food
is the best on campus."

"Branner, where our daddies used
to live," says an old Branner song.
Since 1!)42 there has been no
trace of the masculine flavor which
once permeated Branner Hall.
None, that is, except for the Stan
ford roughs who fill the lobby.
Though it is not as sumptuously
decorated as many of the houses
built expressly for the women,
Branner has an attractive, red
draped lobby and ample living
space. The 180 women are housed
in suites of two rooms accommodat
ing three persons, with a few singles
at the ends of corridors.
Meals arc served three times daily
and twice Sunday in the hall's large
dining room. Both early and late
breakfasts and lunches are served
cafeteria style. Dinner is served at
the tables.
Conveniences of the hall include

two new Bendixes, the "Hole (a
store which sells food and toilet ar
ticles), laundry and cleaning serv
ice, laundry and drying rooms, and
ironing hoards. Pride and joy of •he
hail is its newly added study room
and library which provides a quiet
place to study "away from it all."
Branner's women arc helped by a
resident director, two RA s, a
housekeeper, dining hall director
and staff, maids who clean the
rooms once a week, and many eth
ers.
Government of tlv 1 hall is han
dled through the Branner Women';;
Club, to which all girls pay $3 due .
The dues help pay for corridor
spreads, all - hall spreads, dances,
after-dinner coffees, and other
events. Officers are elected by the
hall twice a year.
A scholarship is given each year
to a needy girl in the hall. The
money for this is raised by the cii'ls
through their annual fashion show,
bridge tournaments, and selling ice
cream and sandwiches.
Women from all classes and all
parts of the country and included in

Branner's heterogeneous population.
Transfers from other colleges, the
| freshman overflow from Roble, scv
eral sponsors, and the girls who
have drawn in — all contribute to the
friendly atmosphere of a hall where
it is a common occurrence to find
women from the same home town,
part of the country, or school, or
who have common acquaintances.
Branner girls have a friendly rc
lationship with the nearby men's
halls. Firesides, volleyball games,
and exchanges are some of the in
formal get-togethers between these
groups.
