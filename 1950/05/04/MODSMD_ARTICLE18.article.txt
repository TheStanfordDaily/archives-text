### 
WASHINGTON, May 3 (AP) - A shouting row broke out in th 3
Senate tonight over Senator McCarthy's charges of Communism
in the State Department, and off the Senate floor Senator Lodge
(R Mass.) demanded closod hearings on further testimony in the
Owen Lattimore case.
"I v/ould like to take this show off the road," Lodge said, allud-

ing to the airing of bitter charges and
counter charges at public hearing .
before a Senate investigating com
mittee.
"I don't see how we can get at the
truth in this matter otherwise."
Lodge and other Republicans have
contended that witnesses in the L;:t
timore case should be quizzed behind
closed doors to prevent the smear in;:
of innocent persons.
Howe/er, the majority of the in -
vestigating committee has ruled
against any more testimony in the
Lattimore affair behind closed door
On the Senate floor, Vice Presiden'
Barkley ordered Democratic leadi
Lucas to sit down after the Repub
lican floor leader, Senator Wherry,
angrily accused Lucas of calling Mc-
Carthy "a liar."
Then the furore broke in earnest.
One senator after another leaped
into the battle over the validity of
McCarthy's charges, and at one point
Senator Neely (D-W.Va.) shouted:
"If McCarthy's charges are nol
true, then those responsible for mak
ing them ought to be scourged from
the society of decent men and wom
en."
But he said it was time, too, for
McCarthy to produce evidence to
support his charges.
"The United States has been made
a laughing-stock," he said.
