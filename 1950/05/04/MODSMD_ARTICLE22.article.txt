# Proposed Drawing System Change
## 
### 
All this fuss which the women on campus
have stirred up this week in connection with
the proposed changes in tho drawing system
brings up a few questions in our mind.
If, as is stated by certain members of AWS,
there is such a large number of miserably un
happy senior women who are non Row dwell
ers, where are these women? Maybe our ac
quaintance with senior women is limited, but
we have not been overwhelmingly impressed
with the uprising of this forgotten group.
In fact, we know both unhappy and happy
women on the Row, in Union, and at Lag.
Another matter related to any proposed
change in the drawing system is the problem of
shrinkage. In the past it has always been those
with the biggest sob-story who moved into Row
houses whenever a vacancy occurred after the
lists had been made up. Since a very large
number of vacancies come about unexpect
edly, we feel that shrinkage should be handled
in the same manner that the drawing is.
Now for the crux of the new plan—the giving
of preference to senior women in the spring
drawing. We feel that all those qualities which
do make living in a small house fun would be
practically unattainable under a system which
would mean a very large turnover each year.
House spirit, house co-operation and all

those qualities which are much more necessary
for any activity in a smaller group would be
difficult to get when a house was predomi
nantly senior. These senior women would
have entered into activities, and on the whole,
would be too busy to do all the dirty work
which is reguired in every function of a Row
house.
Another point which makes living in a small
group enjoyable is the closer friendships
which one makes. Of course, one year is not
going to induce that type of friendship like two
or three would.
And finally, we would like to say to all those
people who may be unhappy with their pres
ent residences, that living on the Row will not
solve all your problems. Just ask anyone who
lives there.
Nothing we say can dispel the notion that
freshman women seem to have that all Row
women are followed around by 10 men at all
times. All we can say is that it isn't true. The
same girls that are "queens" at Roble, at Lag,
at Branner, and at Union are "queens" when
they move onto the Row. And vice versa.
In conclusion we recommend that except for
the matter of shrinkage, which should be made
more equitable, the present plan should be left
as is.—M.K.
