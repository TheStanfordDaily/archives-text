# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
Today we give you a Thursday Grab-bag, just be
cause there isn't much else to give you on a day like
this.
If you're the type of person who doesn't like grab
bags, turn to Bodnar. If you don't like Bodnar. vou'll
just have to wait until Dave Wong

returns — he's gone over to the
Libe to look up another phrase
such as "Horace's prudent pre
cept, saepe stilum vertas" which
went over big last Monday. (I
thought it was Latin for "No's
Never Said ... to a Tot in Bed."
But then, at least I knew it was
Latin.)
At any rate, back to the bag:
WEATHER—The Daily's Spring
Fashion Edition is scheduled to

make it annual appearance tomorrow, that is if the
.sleet, snow, hail, and ice don't blow away the presses.
LIBRARY ART —In case you haven't been to the Li
brary lately, you might like to know that the art school,
or somebody, has moved into the main lobby with an
exhibit of student paintings. Accompanying these
paintings is a suggestion book in which persons may
write their impressions, sort of like the guest book at
Hoover Libe, which by the way, is always closed on
Sundays,
In honor of grab-kag Bull Sessions, a lew entries in
lhat book will now be passed on to vou. For the most
part, the impressions were calmly favorable, but the
.standouts were:
"I may vomit," by Monte Wooley, and "That one of
me isn't nearly flattering enough!" by Louise Monta
gue.
MISSING PERSONS—The bureau of missing persons
has reported that the following have been located:
Lefty Bartlet, one-time creator of the Hamburger

What-Am at Carlun's, which is now making the Ham
burger What-Arn without Lefty, has been found down
the road a piece at The Old Plantation, which was once
Brennan's Drive-In. Lefty has a new style, but the
same old good deals. (All of which is an unpaid, un
solicited plug, which ought to be good enough to get
me at least a free double cherry-coke over ice.)
Also, Suds, likeable, curly-haired, one-time bar
tender at Dinah's, found lust week not there, is now at
John's in San Mateo, next to the Chukker, a restaurant
across the street from Sam's Shoe Shop.
MURAL SOFTBALL DIAMONDS — Thanks to A 1
Masters, the mural diamonds will soon get that needed
attention. The backstops have been ordered, and the
diamonds will be dragged (is it drug?) just like real
baseball fields. Thanks to John Breier, any sports page
readers knew this Monday if they read his column all
the way to the bottom. You should live that long!
FRATERNITY FABLE —Not long ago one of the frat
clubs on top of the hill was having a party. It seems
that everything was going along just as things at a
party should, especially for this one tong member
whose date was under the illusion that he was Clark
Gable or something. So, Clark and his girl wander out
into the parking lot to Clark's open convertible to sit
around and talk things over. Now, all this is very nice,
and probably would have continued to be, except that
this parking lot and this car happened to be sitting
right under a second-story sun porch, and on this sun
porch happens to be one of the brothers who isn't
feeling too good and is not caring who knows it.
You think it isn't possible, eh? Well, neither did
Clark at first. He thought it was raining.
FINAL PLL'G—Just remember, men are still dying
with their boots on, but one boot is usually found on
the accelerator. As The Daily edits would say, "Think
It Over."
And if that's not enough grab-bag items for you,
g'wan over to Roble and grab a bag of your own.
