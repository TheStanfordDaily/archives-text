## A
						Reflection on History Books 
### 
Comes spring, and one does strange things. I read
some history. I am always advising other people to
read history, but I seldom read any myself. Of course,
I read the redoubtable Burns of Western Civ fame, but
I know Bums about as well as a passenger whose ship
visits Shanghai for two hours knows China.
Speaking of reading history, I doubt if I have ever
read a long historical work right through. I have made
one or two magnificent beginnings though. Once when
I was very enthusiastic about my high-school French,
1 started on a huge French work entitled "The General
History from the Fourth Century to the Present Time."
It comprised 12 imposing volumes of about 800 pages
each. I don't think I went beyond the second page of
the first volume. Even then I wasn't quite sure what
was on the first page.
The trouble with reading history is that it's exceed
inly difficult to find first-rate historical writings. His
torians are usually so prejudiced. Some of their writ
ings are often as wild as my impulses to road them.
There are one or two who are quite readable, though.
Ranke isn't bad, but Froude is perhaps better as a
writer of prose than he is as a writer of history.
I was browsing through a few works on Napoleon
Bonaparte recently. It seems the more I read, the less

I knew about him. Lamartine said Napoleon was the
greatest of the creations of God. Frederic Masson said
he accomplished the greatest task that mortal ever
undertook.
John Abbott said his genius was astounding and that
all branches of human knowledge seemed familiar to
his gigantic mind. Sir Archibald Alison said he was
\ equal to Alexander in military achievements, superior
to Justinian in legal information, and possessed at the
same time the inexhaustible resources of Hannibal and
the administrative powers of Caesar.
But then there were others who apparently thought
differently. Lewis Goldsmith wrote: "Never was there,
in one human being, such a combination of cruelty,
tyranny, petulance, lewdness, luxury, and avarice as
there is in Napoleon Bonaparte." In another work en
titled "The Atrocities of the Corsican Demon," Napo
leon was accused of quite unmentionable vices. Of
course, there is always Burns, who dismissed Napoleon
as being "unscrupulous, unprincipled, and capable of
the basest trickery even against his friends.
Having thus lined my mind with layers of contra
dictions, I am really at a loss as to what to believe.
Perhaps to satisfy mv own prejudices I'll have to write
my own history books.
