## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A 2.1 cents a
pack slash in the federal tax on
"economy brand" cigarettes - to
bring back 12 cents a pack smokes —
was approved by the House Ways
and Means Committee today, on a
narrow 13 to 12 vote.
This boosted the tentatively ap
proved cxcise cuts above the bil
lion-dollar mark as the committee
continued to court a Presidential
veto. Previous cutting has covered
furs, jewelry, movie tickcts, and
many other items.
