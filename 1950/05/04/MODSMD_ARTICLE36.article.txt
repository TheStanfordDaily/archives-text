# ON THE BENCH with Al Berry
## 
### 
With hail raining down to the spring practice field, the varsity forces took
time off, yesterday, and took stock of themselves. Starting with the back
lield, things looked good. Nobody on the Coast —USC included—has four
sweeter halfbacks than Benson, Southwood. Hugasian, and White. (White
recently made the retransition from fullback to halfback.) Nobody has better
quarterbacks than Kerkorian and Horn. Fullback is picking up in propor
tion to the ability of Boh Grill in.
But when the condition of the line—for 1950—is viewed, a gruesome
gloom seeps down over our prognostications.
The center spot still looks about as strong as an old rubber band, with
Hick Abraham the only returning regular. Gordy Rice, thought by many to
be last year's best center, is still tied up with his Big Game gained-cast. He
may be due to have a coming out party next Saturday, but even so there is
stern question whether or not the big line backer can get his leg in shape
lor the rigors of the gridiron game.
Still in the "perhaps, maybe, we hope" department are offensive center
candidates Tnhin, Thamer, Hanner, and Freshman Cal Cotlriell. These men
are good hard-working troops, but are hardly in condition to face Army,
rsc, or even USF at this stage of the game.
So, the supposedly "loaded" Stanford Indians are currently possessed
with hut one good center candidate.
The defensive linebacker spot doesn't look much jollier. Big, blond, Iluss
Pomeroy will be invaluable next year. And, of course, Abraham is quite
MiHicient. If the Card eleven could count on the return of Ilice, this spot
wouldn't be too dangerous. But without any such assurance, it would be
surprising if Marchie Schwartz should lose some sleep next fall. Have Wor
ley, last season's JV center, is being groomed for the glory spot, and may pan
out weO. Frosh guard Tommy Romano has been playing the MBU (middle
backer-up), but may be of more value in the line. Loren Ilinkleman and
Skip Crist have also taken a stab at it, but as yet they have not proved them
selves Satisfactory replacements for the likes of Castagnoli and Rice.
Right now the varsity boasts two good tackles —Tex White and lius&
Pomeroy. Also aiding and abetting the games won column will be Wes
Paulson, in good shape from a winter's rugby, and maybe Don Lucas, who
has been plagued with injuries this spring. The three great white hopes of
the tackle position are freshman John Broderick, Ed Taylor, who has been
around.for some years, and on defensive, Leon King, who is certainly big
enoughfto be of some value.
But all is not gloom in the line. The guard spot is in good shape—or at
least jt would he if it weren't for the bone-crushing game of volleyball.
Both Hick Lucas and Joe Jacob have stood (or rather limped) along the
sidelines much of this spring because of the deadlincss of the volleyball
game.
The three top guard prospects for the fall are Lucas, Jess.e Cone, and
freshman "most valuable player" Norm Manoogian. Cone and Lucas may
be the best guard duet since the Great War (second edition). Rod Garner,
a transfer from Compton JC, will add depth to the position, and Bernie
Tokarz, a JV guard last fall, may do the Cards some good on defense.
But we have time and hopes. And we also have a hatch of eager,
hardworking Indians out on the spring practice fields trying to assemble
a great grid machine. They may well do it. But right now we have four
halfbacks, two quarterbacks, three guards, two tackles, one center, three
t iids, and lots and lots df high hopes.

But we have time and hopes. And we also have a hatch of eager,
hardworking Indians out on the spring practice fields trying to assemble
a great grid machine. They may well do it. But right now we have four
halfbacks, two quarterbacks, three guards, two tackles, one center, three
t iids, and lots and lots df high hopes.

With hail raining down to the spring practice field, the varsity forces took
time off, yesterday, and took stock of themselves. Starting with the back
lield, things looked good. Nobody on the Coast —USC included—has four
sweeter halfbacks than Benson, Southwood. Hugasian, and White. (White
recently made the retransition from fullback to halfback.) Nobody has better
quarterbacks than Kerkorian and Horn. Fullback is picking up in propor
tion to the ability of Boh Grill in.
But when the condition of the line—for 1950—is viewed, a gruesome
gloom seeps down over our prognostications.
The center spot still looks about as strong as an old rubber band, with
Hick Abraham the only returning regular. Gordy Rice, thought by many to
be last year's best center, is still tied up with his Big Game gained-cast. He
may be due to have a coming out party next Saturday, but even so there is
stern question whether or not the big line backer can get his leg in shape
lor the rigors of the gridiron game.
Still in the "perhaps, maybe, we hope" department are offensive center
candidates Tnhin, Thamer, Hanner, and Freshman Cal Cotlriell. These men
are good hard-working troops, but are hardly in condition to face Army,
rsc, or even USF at this stage of the game.
So, the supposedly "loaded" Stanford Indians are currently possessed
with hut one good center candidate.
The defensive linebacker spot doesn't look much jollier. Big, blond, Iluss
Pomeroy will be invaluable next year. And, of course, Abraham is quite
MiHicient. If the Card eleven could count on the return of Ilice, this spot
wouldn't be too dangerous. But without any such assurance, it would be
surprising if Marchie Schwartz should lose some sleep next fall. Have Wor
ley, last season's JV center, is being groomed for the glory spot, and may pan
out weO. Frosh guard Tommy Romano has been playing the MBU (middle
backer-up), but may be of more value in the line. Loren Ilinkleman and
Skip Crist have also taken a stab at it, but as yet they have not proved them
selves Satisfactory replacements for the likes of Castagnoli and Rice.
Right now the varsity boasts two good tackles —Tex White and lius&
Pomeroy. Also aiding and abetting the games won column will be Wes
Paulson, in good shape from a winter's rugby, and maybe Don Lucas, who
has been plagued with injuries this spring. The three great white hopes of
the tackle position are freshman John Broderick, Ed Taylor, who has been
around.for some years, and on defensive, Leon King, who is certainly big
enoughfto be of some value.
But all is not gloom in the line. The guard spot is in good shape—or at
least jt would he if it weren't for the bone-crushing game of volleyball.
Both Hick Lucas and Joe Jacob have stood (or rather limped) along the
sidelines much of this spring because of the deadlincss of the volleyball
game.
The three top guard prospects for the fall are Lucas, Jess.e Cone, and
freshman "most valuable player" Norm Manoogian. Cone and Lucas may
be the best guard duet since the Great War (second edition). Rod Garner,
a transfer from Compton JC, will add depth to the position, and Bernie
Tokarz, a JV guard last fall, may do the Cards some good on defense.
