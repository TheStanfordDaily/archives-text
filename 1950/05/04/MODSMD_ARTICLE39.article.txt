# Bryan and Mathias Will Lead Indians in Big Meet Saturday
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Perhaps the greatest iron-man performances in track history
will be put on by Stanford's varsity track ace, Gay Bryan, and its
freshman star, Bob Mathias, who together will enter 13 events
Saturday.
Bryan, who set a new PCC record by scoring five firsts against

UCLA, plans to add the low hurdles
to his already overloaded cinder
schedule, if the Indians need the
points.
Mathias, who has broken three
frosh records and tied another, will
enter seven events for the Stanford
frosh: the shot, the discus, the pole
vault, the high jump, the javelin,
the high hurdles, and the low hur
dles.
Even with Bryan and Mathias, the
Big Meet and the Little Big Meet,
which will be run in alternate
events in Stanford Stadium, are
hoth rated as toss-ups. The Stan
ford and Cal varsity squads have
lost only to USC, while the two
freshman teams are undefeated.
Bryan may find it tough going to
get first places Saturday. Cal's
great sprinter, Donnie Anderson,
has rounded into shape for the first
time since his sophomore year, and
is anxious to avenge two sprint re
lay losses to Bryan in the Big Meet
Relays earlier this season.
The Bears' lanky broad jump ace,
Lyle Stainfield, hit a mark of 23 ft.
11 r, k in. in the meet with Washing
ton last weekend, and may give
Bryan trouble in this event.
Cal's hurdle star, Ted Rademaker,
has been improving every week and
could easily beat a tired Bryan.
In contrast to last weekend, Gay
lord's only easy event will be the
high jump, which he should win
handily.
In addition, Bear Roland Maples

is potentially one of the nation's j
best sprinters. Maples has not as
yet hit his stride this year, but
could open up against Coach Wei
ershauser's diehards.
Mathias will have trouble with
Cal's frosh ace Jim Plessas, former
Lowell High cinder star. Plessas,
an iron man himself, will probably
enter the broad jump, the low hur
dles, and both sprints. Last year
Plessas broke the all-City record in
the lows, and had a broad jump
mark of over 23 feet.
