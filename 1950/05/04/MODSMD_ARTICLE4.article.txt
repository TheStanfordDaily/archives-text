PARIS — Secretary - General
Srygve Lie announced today he is
going to carry his "save the UN
mission to Moscow May 10 and—he
hopes—directly to Prime Minister
Stalin.
He hopes to achieve a world con
ference —a meeting of the United
Nations Security Council with
heads of states and representatives
of all UN members--to end the cold
war and heal a split he said is
threatening to lead "sooner or later
to a third World War.
"The first, step" in ending the cold
war, Lie declared, "must be to re
store the United Nations as a meet
ing place for the negotiation and
conciliation of differences and con
flicts among the great powers."
