# Indian Tankers Go South; Face Bruins and Trojans
## 
### 
Stanford's swimming team travels
south this weekend to take on the
UCLA and USC teams, tomorrow
and Saturday respectively.
Tom Haynie's proteges may be
picked to take the Bruins easily, but
off last week's showing against
COP. things will be different against
the Trojans.
Haynie figures that if the Indians
get the same kind of breaks they
got at Stockton, they will only score
about 25 points out of a possible 75.
However, if the Cardinals swim
their best times, they will have 3(5
points by the time the freestyle re
lay comes around. A come-through
win in this would give the Indians
43 points, or more than enough to
win the meet.
Stanford's sprinters and breast
strokers will come up against the
toughest competition, as both UCLA
and USC are strong in these events.
Best bets to take points Saturday
are Jack Weeden, Frojen, and
Bruce Putnam in the medley relay;
Polte and Hub Stokeley in the 220
free; Bob Wycoff in the 50; Karl
Herrmann in the diving Phil Chap
man or Wycoff in the 100 free; Wee
den and Putnam in the backstroke;
Polte and Frojen in the breast
stroke; Pete Cole (swimming
against Wally Wolf) and John
Mowat in the quarter; and Putnam,

Frojen, Polte, and VVycofT in the
freestyle relay.
