# Sophomore Carnival Boasts of Gay Past
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
Stanford women have
changed.
Or, Stanford men have
c hanged.
When the first all-University car
nal was held in 1930, the re
fc;ed to install a kissing booth be
cause they "could make more money
te'ling tinfoil."
Quoth one damsel, "The men
wouldn't have the courage to patron
i - the booths."
Quoth one rough, "Stanford
y.'omen are right up there when it
c tries to IQ, but they fall just short
o, the standard when it comes to IT."
But at last year's Sophomore Car
nival Theta Chi's "Turtles and Sex"
•■.oved that changes had been made.

New Furnishings
That first carnival, in the fall of
1 30, was not part of the Convalescent
Home Drive but was sponsored by
5 !an ford women to buy furnishings
( r the new Women's Gym.
In 1932, a depression year, profits
from the affair went to student relief.
he extravaganza was still held in
l'ie fall, netting $433.
After a two-year layoff, the Farm
c irnival returned, bringing with it a
150 profit. In 1937 the games and
contests, held in the spring, went to
l'ie Convalescent Home.
Since then the carnival (now the j
112 ophomore Carnival) has been part
«>£ the Con Home Drive, helping to I
nance the Stanford-sponsored home i
!or convalescent children.
Baseball throws, penny pitching,
;nd nail-hammering contests have [
1 een perennial money-getters.
Campus Telegrams
But stranger concessions have |
cropped up from time to time. In
1947 Madrono Hall recorded the cus
tomers', voices, for a fee. Union Resi
dence sent telegrams anywhere j
within the carnival limits. The Oaks
dared patrons to toss the hoop onto
an alluring "Oak limb."
Roble Hall provided taxi dancers,
and Lagunita Court set up an artists'
colony. The Betas threw rotten eggs
at their pledges.
In 1948 over 50 concessions jammed
the Pavilion, including miniature
golf, a cow-milking contest, and
Cubberley's popular freak show. To
win a prize at one booth, the game
ster had to shave a balloon without
scratching its delicate skin.
Last year, Roble gave sponge baths.
The Phi Sigs pulled out the green felt
and played black-jack. Branner
stooped to shine shoes, and the Delts
set up a gambling casino. Durand
House bet the customer he couldn't
hit the broad side of a cigarette with
a bean.
This year the Sophomore Carnival !
will return to the Pavilion—supplied, i
as usual, with several booths offering
food and other refreshments for fa
tigued game-players.

music of Hal Lent and his orchestra. Patrick Maveety becomes the Hong Kong version of Atlas,
Marcia Musser Leslie Young Dali's interpretation of Carmen, and Mary Hice a Miro
like bug. —Daily photo by Don Dapelo
