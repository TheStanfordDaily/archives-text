* A crowd of students which jam-packed the
J Pavilion stood and cheered last night as Sam
McDonald was introduced at the annual Barbe-;
cue dinner.
The ovation highlighted Sam McDonald Day,

wll llll was in iy btippi#:->uu iu uu
the day when the student body la
bored at the Con Home.
However, a near-cloudburst early
in the afternoon washed out some of
the work plans, and forced the trans
fer of the barbecue from the Con
Home to the Pavilion.
McDonald spoke briefly to the stu
[ dents about his 47 years here, and
his talk was followed by the tradi
tional singing of "For He's a Jolly
Good Fellow." McDonald was intro
duced by Murray Draper, former
student body president and track star
at Stanford.
Even the long-time Stanford stu
dents, veterans of meal lines, and
Reg Day and Bookstore lines, were
awed by the length of the queue out
vide tljc Pavilion about 5:i50.
When th" Pavilion doors first
I opened, the line stretched in an enor
mous arc from the doors almost to
the cast entrance to Encina Com
mons.
There was a second line in back of
the Pavilion, but skeptical students
stayed away for the most part from
this faster-moving and shorter line.
Once inside the Pavilion, the stu
dents were entertained by a varied
group of campus talent, including
Nancy Toll, Dad Rango, and others.
The sun was out for most of the
afternoon following the heavy rain
and working conditions at the Con
I Home were actually pretty good, ac
j cording to Chuck Getchell, who was
in charge of the work.
A crew of over 100 workers spent
the afternoon working on the
grounds, and most of the work
| planned was accomplished. Ted
j But I nor, Jerry Breuner, and Wajme
j Williamson headed the laborers.
Several girls worked painting toys,
| and a crew of men succeeded in trim
j ming and clearing the ground along
the fence which runs beside the main
entrance.
The Stanford Band played nursery
songs as scheduled for the kids at
the Home, with each band member
j demonstrating his instrument.
