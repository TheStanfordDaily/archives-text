# It's the Sheer Look For a Cool 'Loafer'
## 
### 
If you're fashion wise, you will be
seen in transparent materials this
summer. Maybe it will be a shirt
waist dress of sheer cotton voile or
silk chiffon, or a dancing dress of pale
pastel tulle.
You might try velvet dotted swiss
or light tissue cotton, or a billowy
organdy frock frosted with embroid
ery.
Show your feet in strip sandles, and
top j'our shining lock with a tiny cap
of starched lace. Then from head to
toe,â–  you'll be right for 1950.
