Orange blossoms and then .... JUNE AND 808 BALDWIN
pause in front of their new Mercury before starting off. June
looks chic in her beige gabardine suit from CAROLYN KEL
SEY'S. The fitted jacket is double-breasted and has a horseshoe

collar of black linen. The skirt is pencil slim. The hat of black
straw with a velveteen trim is also from Carolyn Kelsey's. Bob's
grey worsted cheviot suit is from ATKIN'S. The jacket is single
breasted with patch pockets.
