# There's More Than the Wedding Gown When You're Scanning the Trousseau
## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
Summer fabrics — cottons, linens,
nylon, light gabardine—are a boon to
the bride who wants to stay within
a slim budget. And economy will cer
tainly be the watchword for many a
girl starting married life soon after
graduation.
Her going-away suit is the first
item of the trousseau to come to mind,
of course. It will probably be a
butcher linen, or gabardine, in pas
tels, navy, or beige. While suit skirts
this summer all follow pretty much
the same basic pattern —straight with
one pleat or fold, often in the back—
the jackets can add all sorts of vari- j
ety.
Jackets may be softly fitted at the
waist and hips, or they may be the
boxy type. They can be very short J
or hip length. They can have collars J
ranging all the way from a very slight
and soft roll-back at the throat to one
almost wide enough to be compared
to the traditional sailor. Many of
them have slight hip interest with
buttons, pouch pockets, or a series of
V-shaped cufTs on the pockets.
Often a very wise idea for the eco
nomically-minded young bride is to
have another suit which she can in
terchange with her original going
away suit, thus having four dress-up
and "down-town" outfits from two.
Cotton skirts, blouses, and dresses
can double and triple for home, party, j
and town wear. A very few skirts and 1
blouses can be changed around
among themselves to provide many
new and interesting outfits.
Accessories are in important con
sideration in planning any new ward
robe. The summer bride can choose
matching bags, hats, and shoes in
either linen or straw. Many of the
tiny new hats are coming out in straw
of all shades of the rainbow. And she
can buy both dressy shoes and com
fortable play shoes in any material

[ and style that suits her taste and
ipocketbook.
Frilly and feminine lingerie is, of
course, one of the most important
parts of any bridal trousseau. Here
her fancy can run wild among the
; infinite assortment of siiks and lace
| and bows. And it is here where nylon
j is going to be the big thing. For the
] girl who wants pretty and dainty lin
gerie, but doesn't have time to be
bothered with laundry and ironing
problems, there is nothing like nylon.

i Every girl knows how nylon can be
! washed out in a hurry and it will dry
I in a few hours with no need for irori
[ ing. What could be a greater con
venience for a housewife, especially
one who may be working too.
And blouses are now being made in
nylon which are cool and pretty for
j summer wear as well. Hiey pack
easily and wrinkles are practically
non-existent—a wonderful boon for
' honeymoon travel.
