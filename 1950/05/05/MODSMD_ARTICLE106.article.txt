# You've Head in the Clouds, But Both Feet on the Ground

Whether it be the small details of
preparing meals, the bigger job of
guiding the future of the family, some
plan and purpose must give meaning
and organization to the efforts of hus
band and wife.
Suddenly pushed to the foreground
in the lives of most young couples is
the spectcr of the Budget. There is no
such animal as a typical budget; fig
ures are only guides, and each list of
expenses to be met must be tailor
made.
First, budget headings must fit
YOUR needs; if you own a car, set
aside a certain amount each month
for gasoline, oil, and repairs. Other
budget divisions will probably go like
this: Shelter; Food; Clothing; Operat
ing Costs; Savings and Insurance; and
Advancement (magazines, new car,
contributions, etc.)
Rents, or installments on your
home, should not exceed a fourth of
the monthly income. Food costs again
should not usually have to go over
the quarter mark — although, when
skimping comes in, food should be the

i last item cut. Shop when certain
; foodstuffs are in season, but beware
j of bargains as bargains—they may not
always be of satisfactory quality.
To buy or not to buy is another
problem for newlyweds. If you plan
to spend a short time only in your first
location, it seems hardly worthwhile
to invest in your own home. If you
plan to buy or build, however, here
are a few pointers:
1. G.I. homes in Palo Alto (one of
the highest rent residential dis
tricts in the country) range from
88,000 to $12,000 with monthly in
stallments of $60 or $70.
2. Look at the fundamentals of your
new home. Be sure there is ade
quate lighting (windows and
electricity), plumbing, kitchen
floor and cupboard space, and
spare room for a washing ma
chine or large refrigerator.
Above all, when you buy on the in
stallment. plan (whether it be house
or footstool), find out your interest
and carrying charges; keep track of
all your receipts, and check them with
your budget.
Good luck!
