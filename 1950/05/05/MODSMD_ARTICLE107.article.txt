# After Rice Travel Nice
## 
### 
When you've brushed the rice from
your clothes and smiled a few quick
goodbyes, you can scoop up your lug
gage and be off. For where? Where
to spend a honeymoon . . .
If you're smart you won't read this,
but you'll find some place that's never
been photographed for a travel folder
and that you can't get to by plane.
Maybe you've always wanted to see
Bermuda, to bury your toes in the
sand on the beach, to wander through
old Spanish churches, and to see the
things you've read about: Spanish
Point, St. David's Lighthouse, the
crystal caves, and the underworld of
the sea through glass-bottomed boats.
Or is it to Mexico you think you
want to go? Maybe to Chapultepec
Park, the shrine of Guadalupe, the
Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon,
the flowers at Cuernavaca. Or per
haps you've heard of Taxco, Old
Mexico, they say and Xochimilco and
the canals that remind some people of
Venice.
Maybe you'll set sail for Hawaii to
the exotic flwoers, canyons, water
falls, and white beaches of Kaui, the
beach of Waikiki on Oahu, the pine
apple plantations on Molokai, or the
island Hawaii and its giant tree ferns,
snow-capped volcanoes, and the
black sands of Kalapana.
Even if you have read this article
and all the glamorous, gay travel ads.
maybe you'll find some place all
your ownâ€”someplace you can always
eo hack to.
