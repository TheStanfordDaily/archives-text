# Learn To Combine Fiance And Finance
## 
### SUE TOLNAY 
A bride-to-be and her fiance are faced with many why, what,
when, and how problems for weeks in advance of their marriage.
Here are just a few answers to some of the sticklers.
Before setting the date for a churclj wedding, the bride should
find out when her clergyman has a free day, so her marriage will

not conflict with his or the church
schedule.
Next comes the selection of invi
tations at the stationer's, which
should be done about two months in
advance. Both mothers make up the
list for the wedding and reception in
vitations (here the annual Christmas
card list can be useful). Invitations
should always be addressed by hand,
and should be mailed between one
month and two weeks before the
wedding.
The church is decorated with
masses of flowers—sprays tied to the
pew ends and floral decoration of tho
chancel. Music for the ceremony
should be settled far ahead of time
with the organist and soloist, if there
is to be one.
A big question is who pays for
what? The bride pays for the recep
tion, flowers for the church, music,
bridesmaids' presents, bridesmaids'
bouquets, church fees, and invita
tions. The groom settles the bride's
bouquet, minister's fee, ushers' pres
ents, honeymoon, and.he bride's
going-away corsage.
Before the marriage ceremony, the
family and friends of the bride are
seated on the left, while the groom's
family and friends are seated on the
right. The bride's mother is the last
person to enter the church before the
bridal party.
The house wedding differs slightly
from the church wedding. In the first
place, size limits the number of wed
ding guests, and in the second place,
a home ceremony involves less ex
pense.
The wedding takes place in a
drawing room or living room, with a
small place fenced off for the altar.
There is always a bench or a cushion
on which the bride and groom kneel
during the ceremony.
In a home wedding, the bride and
groom take no single step together.
The groom meets her where the serv
ice is read, and there is no reces-

sional after the ceremony. The cler
gyman leaves, the prayer bench is
removed, and the bride and groom
receive their guests there or in an
other room.
Before the ceremony, the bride's
mother stands at the door of the room
where the marriage is to take place
to receive people as they arrive. The
groom's mother takes her place near
the altar with the rest of the im
mediate family.
The order is the reception line is
also important: (1) bride's mother;
(2) groom's mother; (3) bride's fa
ther; (4) groom's father; (5) bride;
((>) groom; (7) maid of honor; (8)
best man; (9) bridesmaids. The men,
except for the groom, do not have to
stand in the line; they may float
around to help entertain the guests
(and drink champagne).
When the cake is to be cut, the
groom stands to the right of the bride,
and holds her right hand in his right
hand.
After the honeymoon, the bride
has her work cut out for her—she
has to v/rite all her thank-you notes
by hand; engraved cards of thanks
are taboo. If the bride has kept a list
of gifts and who sent them, her task
will be much lighter.


A must for the bride is this white nylon nightgown topped by a
nylon peignoir modeled by FRONSA THAYER. Nylon net
edges the full sleeves and neckline of the peignoir. Both are
from THE CLOTHES CLOSET. The rabbit fur trimmed scuffs
are from ZWIERLEfN'S
