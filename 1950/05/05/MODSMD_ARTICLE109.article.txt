# Ideas for That Wedding Present
## 
### 
April Showers bring May flowers,
and they also bring wedding plans for
couples who set their dates for soon
after graduation. This means wedding
gifts and if you have a lot of friends
who are "taking the big step" you
must choose attractive gifts with an
eye to your budget.
Practically anything sterling makes
a nice gift. You can get gravey ladels,
meat forks, bonbon dishes, cream
and sugar bowls, or place settings in
the bride's pattern at prices which
aren't budget breaking.
China and linens are always ap
preciated by newly weds. How about
a dozen liqueur glasses or perhaps
some glass dessert dishes. Guest
towels seem commonplace but are
essential in a new home. Luncheon
sets which can double for bridge
parties are also welcomed.
