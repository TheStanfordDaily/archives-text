funds for the Stanford Convalescent Home children has brought in $2,479.97 from activities
so far. Proceeds from the Sophomore Carnival tonight and the Masque Ball tomorrow night
are expected to swell this total to approximately $4,000. The money collected in the drive
maintains four beds at the Home for a year. -Photo by Howard Garnick
