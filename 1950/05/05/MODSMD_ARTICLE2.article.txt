# Chrysler Strike Ends
## 
### 
I) !•: T KOI I' — Chrysler's 89,000
striking CIO United Auto Workers
will start streaming back to work
Monday- their 100-day strike over.
When they end their string of
payless paydays, Chrysler workers
will be going back with everything
they asked in the way of $100
monthly pensions (including federal
Social Security benefits), backed by
a jointly administered trust fund.
Estimates show that strikers av
eraged wage losses of $1,000 each
because of the walkout. With new
10-ccnt hourly gains it would take
them live years to make up the
lost pay.
