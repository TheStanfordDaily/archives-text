# The 						lower on Sundays

### 
fivery Sunday parents, tourists, and just
plain friends of Stanford spend an afternoon
■ ii campus going through the famous Morno
nal Church, walking along the tree-lined path
way:-! of frost Amphitheater, and staring at the
SiHfJ foot height of the Hoover Tow i.
Yet this imposing "Gateway to Stanford"
r.fands only as a statue to Sunday afternoon
vi. l itors. Camera enthusiasts, fresh ah fiends,
.ind those who appreciate the valley's beauti
fill panorama must keep their feet on the
ground because the University has not seen
fit to open the tower to Sunday sightseers.
Those with authority say the added cost of
imaintaining a Sunday staff and the added ie
■ ponibility for safeguarding the valuable con
tents of the library would not merit opening
tl j«■ building.
Over in the Employment Service is a list of
job seekers several pages long. In the "(Jell''
v/here the student guides keep office hours
Sunday afternoon are several employees anx
ious to introduce the Stanford campus to visi
tois.
Library officials say it would be too hard to
close off the rest of the library. We answer
that one library employee seated at a desk
in the front corridor leading to the elevator en

trance could make sure that no one wanders
into the inner sanctum.
Two additional guides would be necessary
to operate the elevator and remain with the
gut sts in the belfry. The entire cost would not
top $15 each Sunday.
Is there no place in the budget for sue!} an
expense? The Hoover Library budget is lim
ited and an appropriation to keep the Tower
open would have to be recommended by the
University's General Secretary and approved
by the Board of Trustees.
Across the Bay at Berkeley is located a some
what cracked but similar tower. Tourists can
get an elevator ride to the top for ten cents.
Naturally there are not the valuable objects
stored in the Campanile which are found in
the Hoover Tower. But the fact remains, the
small fee is acceptable for maintaining the
tours.
11 no place can be found in the University
budget for opening the Tower on Sunday, we
are sure no one would object to a similar fee.
Money is spent with no guestions asked
when it comes to hiring public relations experts
for a business or for an educational institu
tion. Perhaps our public relations could be
improved by opening the Tower when there
is a definite need for it.— G. A.
