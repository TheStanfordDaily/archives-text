# Fence Goes Up Around 'Yard'
## 
### 
All openings in the wall around
the Corporation Yard, the Stanford
storehouse and equipment area, are
being enclosed with wire fencing,
according to Carroll Blacker, super
intendent of buildings and grounds.
Blacker said the fencing was be
ing put up as a matter of security.
He added that there was too much
valuable equipment in the yard to
leave it open as it has been.
The yard has seen a yearly loss
of $800 for some time.
Gates in the new fence will be
locked nights and on Saturdays,
Sundays, and holidays. A pedes

department will lie kepi open, how
ever.
The fence is being erected at a
cost ol $100 to $150. Most of it is
used material, part of it. coming
lrom the fencing that was formerly
around the psychopathic ward at
Dibble Hospital, now Stanford Vil
lage.
