WASHINGTON â€” President Tru
man sought today to allay fears of
a shooting war with Russia. He
said he is not alarmed, and the sit
uation now is not nearly as bad as
il was in the first hall of 194(5.
He said he thinks the world situ
ation is improving, and while he
may be an optimist, one has to be
an optimist to be President of the
United States.
He spoke out at a news confer
ence against a reorganized United
Nations with Russia excluded, as
suggested by former President Hoo
ver, and said the U.S. will continue
to support the UN as long as he is
President. In most instances the UN
is working well, he added.
