# Papooses In Cinder Test Against Cal
## 
### HOWARD SEARS 
Tomorrow's Little Big Meet pits
the undefeated Papooses against
Cal's powerful Cubs. Run right
along with its varsity counterpart,
the meet will st»rt at noon with the
discus.
Stanford's yearlings can point
with little pride to their record in
these meets with the "across the
Bay" rivals. In the past 17 years
they have won only three times, in
1933, 1940, and lust year. But this
time, the Farm lads go into the fray
undefeated, and they will face their
once-beaten opponents as slight fa
vorites.
Mathias Ready
Big feature of the day will be the
seven-star performance of captain
Bob Mathias. The Olympic decathlon
ace is expected to grab firsts in the
discus, shot, pole vault, and possibly
the high barriers. He'll score points
in the lows, javelin, and the hgih
jump. He holds the freshman rec
ord in the discus, pole vault, and
shot, and has tied the best mark in
the highs.
His high jumping, consistently
over 6 feet, will probably place him
second to teammate Norm Jiles who
has been crowding the record of G
feet 4 inches all season. The best
that any Cal jumper has managed
to date is an unimpressive 5 feet
11 inches.
Another frosh who may step into
the winner's spot more than once
is distance runner Bob Simon. Si
mon will enter the 880 and the mile,
where he will have some very re
spectable competition from Cal's
Morrison whose best times are mere
fractions off of Simon's best.
Cal in Sprints
The sprints will probably fall to
Cal and will star Jim Plessas and
Ted Hutchenson. Stanford's Mau
rice Parsons is picked to finish third
behind these two.
In the broad jump, the frosh's
jumping trio, Pete McKay, Tom
Schabarum, and Russ Stolfi, may
find trouble also from the versatile
Plessas. The Californian has not
yet equaled his best high school
performance, which was a record 23
feet.
Tomorrow's meet could see sev
eral long - standing meet records
fall. Mathias looks sure to- crash
the discus mark, and he could top
ple the high hurdles and shot fig
ures. He has not competed in the
javelin before this year. Jiles could
break the meet high jump record,
and several other men from both
schools have been hitting danger
ously near peak performances.

rice Parsons is picked to finish third
behind these two.
In the broad jump, the frosh's
jumping trio, Pete McKay, Tom
Schabarum, and Russ Stolfi, may
find trouble also from the versatile
Plessas. The Californian has not
yet equaled his best high school
performance, which was a record 23
feet.
Tomorrow's meet could see sev
eral long - standing meet records
fall. Mathias looks sure to- crash
the discus mark, and he could top
ple the high hurdles and shot fig
ures. He has not competed in the
javelin before this year. Jiles could
break the meet high jump record,
and several other men from both
schools have been hitting danger
ously near peak performances.
Tomorrow's Little Big Meet pits
the undefeated Papooses against
Cal's powerful Cubs. Run right
along with its varsity counterpart,
the meet will st»rt at noon with the
discus.
Stanford's yearlings can point
with little pride to their record in
these meets with the "across the
Bay" rivals. In the past 17 years
they have won only three times, in
1933, 1940, and lust year. But this
time, the Farm lads go into the fray
undefeated, and they will face their
once-beaten opponents as slight fa
vorites.
Mathias Ready
Big feature of the day will be the
seven-star performance of captain
Bob Mathias. The Olympic decathlon
ace is expected to grab firsts in the
discus, shot, pole vault, and possibly
the high barriers. He'll score points
in the lows, javelin, and the hgih
jump. He holds the freshman rec
ord in the discus, pole vault, and
shot, and has tied the best mark in
the highs.
His high jumping, consistently
over 6 feet, will probably place him
second to teammate Norm Jiles who
has been crowding the record of G
feet 4 inches all season. The best
that any Cal jumper has managed
to date is an unimpressive 5 feet
11 inches.
Another frosh who may step into
the winner's spot more than once
is distance runner Bob Simon. Si
mon will enter the 880 and the mile,
where he will have some very re
spectable competition from Cal's
Morrison whose best times are mere
fractions off of Simon's best.
Cal in Sprints
The sprints will probably fall to
Cal and will star Jim Plessas and
Ted Hutchenson. Stanford's Mau
rice Parsons is picked to finish third
behind these two.
