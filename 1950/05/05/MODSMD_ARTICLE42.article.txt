# Cardinal Nine Tries Series Sweep Over Cal Tomorrow
## Indians Tackle Pacific Tigers In Non-Loop Game Today 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Tomorrow afternoon Stanford goes after its first sweep of a Cali
fornia baseball series in 19 years. Last time the Indians turned
the trick was back in 1931, when they also won their first and
last CIBA championship.
Stanford previously took the measure of the Bears this season

4 to 3 and 5 to 2 at Berkeley and
hope to continue on their winning
ways tomorrow in the Sunken Dia
mond.
With six games still remaining on
the CIBA slate for the Cards, they
hold a game and a half bulge over
USC, St. Mary's, and California.
While Stanford and California are
battling it out in the Big Series
finale, USC will be entertaining St.
Mary's on the Trojan campus in a
two-game series. A double loss by
etiher team would practically drop
them out of the running.
Everett Dean will send Jack Hei
nen to the hill to face California,
which knocked Santa Clara into

fifth place Wednesday with a 5 to 1
win. Heinen is leading the CIBA
to date in the strike-out department
with 39 victims to his credit.
The Bears will probably counter
with either Bill Gear or Andy Sta
gnaro. Gear almost upset USC last
Saturday as he limited the hard
hitting Trojans to six base hits. Two
unearned runs proved his downfall
as USC squeaked by 3 to 2. Sta
gnaro was victim of Stanford's two
earlier wins over the Bears.
Mainstay of the Bear attack is
their second baseman Don Dodson.
Dodson moved into fourth place in
the CIBA batting race last week
with a .372. He is tied with Santa
Clara's Joe Nally in home runs with
3 and has 11 runs batted in to his
credit. Left fielder Pete Corona is
the only other Bear among the top
ten batters with a mark of .360.
Stanford will be looking to the
middle of its batting order to sup
ply the winning punch at the plate.
Dick Clegg moved into second place
in the batting race with .387 be

hind USC's hard-hitting outfielder
Jay Roundy, who boasts a rousing
.428.
Dave Melton (.342) and Bud
Klein (314) are the only other Card
batters currently over the .250
mark.
This afternoon the Indians will
play College of the Pacific in a non
conference warm-up game in the
Sunken Diamond. Jim Claypool is
slated to get the starting call on
the mound against the Tigers. Game
time for both today's and tomor
row's games is 3:15.

With six games still remaining on
the CIBA slate for the Cards, they
hold a game and a half bulge over
USC, St. Mary's, and California.
While Stanford and California are
battling it out in the Big Series
finale, USC will be entertaining St.
Mary's on the Trojan campus in a
two-game series. A double loss by
etiher team would practically drop
them out of the running.
Everett Dean will send Jack Hei
nen to the hill to face California,
which knocked Santa Clara into

fifth place Wednesday with a 5 to 1
win. Heinen is leading the CIBA
to date in the strike-out department
with 39 victims to his credit.
The Bears will probably counter
with either Bill Gear or Andy Sta
gnaro. Gear almost upset USC last
Saturday as he limited the hard
hitting Trojans to six base hits. Two
unearned runs proved his downfall
as USC squeaked by 3 to 2. Sta
gnaro was victim of Stanford's two
earlier wins over the Bears.
Mainstay of the Bear attack is
their second baseman Don Dodson.
Dodson moved into fourth place in
the CIBA batting race last week
with a .372. He is tied with Santa
Clara's Joe Nally in home runs with
3 and has 11 runs batted in to his
credit. Left fielder Pete Corona is
the only other Bear among the top
ten batters with a mark of .360.
Stanford will be looking to the
middle of its batting order to sup
ply the winning punch at the plate.
Dick Clegg moved into second place
in the batting race with .387 be

hind USC's hard-hitting outfielder
Jay Roundy, who boasts a rousing
.428.
Dave Melton (.342) and Bud
Klein (314) are the only other Card
batters currently over the .250
mark.
This afternoon the Indians will
play College of the Pacific in a non
conference warm-up game in the
Sunken Diamond. Jim Claypool is
slated to get the starting call on
the mound against the Tigers. Game
time for both today's and tomor
row's games is 3:15.

Saturday's game:

the trick was back in 1931, when they also won their first and
last CIBA championship.

4 to 3 and 5 to 2 at Berkeley and
