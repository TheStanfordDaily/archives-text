# Golfers Play Weekend Pair
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity golf team, fresh
from their surprising victory over
San Jose State, entrained for Los
Angeles yesterday afternoon for a
pair of weekend matches with USC
and UCLA.
This afternoon the Indians will
match strokes with the defending
Southern Division champions from
Troy on the north course of the Los
Angeles Country Club. This is the
same course where the Trojans
edged Stanford for the title last
year.
Letterman Leonard Kennett is the
Trojans' top golfer. Kennett won the
Southern California Intercollegiates
last month, and led USC to a 31 to
23 victory over California. Other
Trojan letter-winners include Don
Davies and Bob Pastore. Leon
Clark, Grant Meyer, and Alton Zu
tavern round out the squad.
Tomorrow morning Coach Bud
Finger's men will battle UCLA on
the Bel Air course. The Bruins fin
ished last in the conference tour
nament last year, but they were
good enough to win a dual match
from the Indians.
The Indians will use the same
sixsome that has given them six
victories against only one loss this
season. Given breaks in the right
places, the Indians could return to
the Farm with two more scalps
under their belt.
