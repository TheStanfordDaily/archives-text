Casa Ventura residents awoke the
oilier morning to find their front lawn
r 1 raced with a wooden relic of the
prc-plumbing era, apparently signi-
I;, ing their distance from civilization.
The Ventura women staunchly de
le id their location on campus, how
ever. They claim there is no better
place from which to reach an 8
o'clock in the C'hem Building. And
i: n't their sun porch the most ex
clusive on campus? No strap marks

Comparative Isolation
Casa Ventura is located west of old
Sequoia Hall on Sena street, next to
(lie Microwave Laboratory. Its com-
I ■■ rative isolation and large grounds
give it an informal atmosphere. A
i irbecue pit and ample lawn space
; Id to the pleasantness of casual liv
ing, and girls may appear in the yard
iii sfiorts and jeans.
Though it is a separate living area,
Casa Ventura has no cooking facil
ities. The girls must eat at Lagunita. j
l ie greatest inconvenience of their j
location. Since several of the women
have cars, many girls can ride rather j
than walk.
Apartment House
Casa Ventura was formerly a fac
ulty apartment house. Spacious j
i 'joras and attractive furniture make |
it one of the nicest living quarters |
lor women on campus. The girls are ;
l oused in pairs in two-room suites.
The hall houses 56 girls, and is run
112 n the dorm system. It is headed by
a resident director, and also has the
usual dorm officials.
Hall government is handled en
tirely by the girls, as in all living
groups on campus. The women elect
officers to handle their activities, and
pay $3.50 dues each quarter. They

| hold many social events, including
dances, parties, and spreads.
Ventura's isolation and its being a
I separate living area give it a peculiar
j position in campus life. The girls
must enter float parades, contests,
and carnivals on their own instead
of joining with a larger group, as the
houses on the Row do.
Active on Campus
To make themselves known as a
hall, the women must be active in
both campus and house affairs —and
they are. Allyson Clark, president,
feels that because of the spirited par
ticipation of the women, Casa Ven
tura is becoming more than just a
word to the rest of the campus.
In summing up the advantages of
Casa Ventura, Allyson says, "In any
house, it's the girls who are impor
tant, not the location. Though Ven
tura is isolated, this disadvantage is
countered by beautiful rooms and
grounds and a friendly, informal
spirit among the girls. It's worth the
walk."

Ventura's isolation and its being a

Active on Campus
To make themselves known as a
hall, the women must be active in
both campus and house affairs —and
they are. Allyson Clark, president,
feels that because of the spirited par
ticipation of the women, Casa Ven
tura is becoming more than just a
word to the rest of the campus.
In summing up the advantages of
Casa Ventura, Allyson says, "In any
house, it's the girls who are impor
tant, not the location. Though Ven
tura is isolated, this disadvantage is
countered by beautiful rooms and
grounds and a friendly, informal
spirit among the girls. It's worth the
walk."
