If you are among the lucky ones
whose life-long dreams ol a trip 1o
Europe are about lo come true, here
are a few tips on what to pack for
your continental journey.
Whether you are steamship-bound
or plan to travel by Uniled or TWA,
your wardrobe should be limited to
I the basic essentials, l! is advised that
! your luggage should not exceed 50
j pounds. According to "Fielding's
j Guide to Europe":
The first iu'e ol the sensible trav- j
eler is to limit her luggage to what
I she can pick up and carry herself.
! ... 11 you exceed this limit, you are
| going to be slowed up in customs,
i helpless without pollers, open for pi 1 -
! ferage, unpopular with male travelers
(who have their own heavy suit
j cases), and, at least three times a day,
i mad as a wet hen.
IJncriishal.'le Fabrics
The lightweight and uucrushable
j fabrics which have been introduced
j into the latest spring fashions will
j prove indispensable in selecting the
I right clothes to take. Shantungs, uu
crushable linens, the new nylons,
! ranging from simple basic outfits to
fancy cocktail dresses, rayon or ny
lon jersey, nylon linen dresses (spun
j like linen) will alleviate the problem
i of "traveling wrinkles," in addition to
j wearing well and saving laundry
| time.
Cotton dresses, preferably simple
ones of dark colors, will come in
handy, especially sunback dresses,
which will serve a dual purpose on
those hot summer days.
Knit Dr esses
Knit dresses are also recommended
for they will take the wear and tear
of constant traveling without losing
j their shape.
A suit of sturdy material that will
take a good pressing and can hold its
shape should also be included. Since
travel is hard on clothes, it is advis
| able to use your oldest suit if it is of
j a durable quality instead ol buying
something newer and of a poorer
| material.
As for a coat, something light
| weight and waterproof will be per
! feet. Neutral-colored topcoats and
I all-purpose black gabardine Hying
j coats are some samples of wh;it the
j stores are showing. If you have a fur ;
I jacket and plan to do some first-class j
j touring it might come in handy.
Sturdy Shoes
The most important item in your i
! wardrobe are shoes, for you will be j
j doing much sightseeing by foot.
Three pairs of walking shoes (full :
i rubber soles make the cobbled streets !
! of Paris seem smoother) and one pair 1

| ol dress shoes should suffice.
For your lingerie, nylon comes to
the rescue for quick drying and
: easy packing. Leave your silk and
| rayon pajamas at home because
' they'll be ruined by improper wash

ing. Take broadcloth, fine cottons, or
good old nylon.
Scarves and jewelry will prove in
valuable in dressing up that basic
dress. Sweaters, cashmere or wool,
are another necessity. 11 you plan on

taking a hat, soft crushable crochets
pack easily, as do berets.
It would be advisable to transfer
all your make-up into lightweight
plastic containers and again to limit
yourseH to tlie barest essentials.
