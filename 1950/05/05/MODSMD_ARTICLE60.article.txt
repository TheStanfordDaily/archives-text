By the time you've finished
all your arrangements for the
Grand Tour this summer, you'll
feel like some species of gold
fish caught in a glass bowl.
Cn one hand, you'll have the
Health Service periodically jabbing
you with a long needle; on the other
h; nd, you'll have the federal gov
ernment poring over your birth cer
tificate; and perhaps in the rear you'll
have a benevolent travel agency
bombarding you with the latest cir
culars on "Vivacious Paree" and
"Sunny Italy."
First on the list is the passport,
which you can obtain at the Federal
Building in San Francisco or at a
county seat, such as Redwood City.
However, if you have drasticaHy
changed appearance (such as cutting
hair) since your passport picture was
taken, the county office will not issue
you a passport.
Witnesses must accompany all
people desiring passports. The wit
nesses have to be persons over 21,
not related, and willing to swear in
writing that they have known the
passportee for three years. The pass
port fee is $10, or $11 if speed is re
quired.
You will also need a copy of your j
bitth certificate, which will be sent ;
back to Washington with your pass
port application.
Another necessity is a smallpox
vaccination. The Health Service han
dles this, plus the various other shots
which may or may not be required of
you (depending on which countries
you plan to visit).
Ordinarily, your scries of shots
should be started from two to three |
months ahead of your departure, but ;
it is possible to speed them up |
slightly. It's a good idea to get ty- :
phoid, typhur, and tetanus shot:;, i
especially if you're going to Italy, |
Mexico, or South America. Other in- j
jections may be needed for Africa or
the Orient.
The Health Service will also pro
vide a yellow sheet with a record of I
the shots, and the doctor's required j
signature on the smallpox vaccina
tion. This paper is necessary if you
want to come home.
As for language, a few basic
phrases, such as "Ou se trouve le
'Jour Eiffel, or Bal Taharin" will help \
Lut on the whole, book-taught lan- j
guage is no great boon. If worst
comes to worst, you'll probably pick i
up a little of the native tongue or 1
some one who speaks English. !
French, of course, is THE language j
in Europe, and Spanish or Portu
guese with variations is spoken in
South America.
Hints to the wise department: Take
along about four cartons (that's a
good passable number) of cigarettes,
even if you don't smoke. They aren't

used much for barter, but you might
have the chance of a lifetime in some
obscure town to exchange them for
something pretty valuable.
Travelers' checks are an A-l asset
in Switzerland if you exchange
money there. Actual currency is
rather frowned upon, and you may
pass up a good deal if that's all you're
carrying. On the other hand, beware
of the little men who creep up to you
on side streets and offer you the
Leaning Tower of Pisrt for 10 Ameri
can "doe-larrs" — it's the old con
game.
Soap capsules or "ieaves" are no
trouble to pack, and may come in
handy when you want to wash your
grimy hands someplace where there's
no soap. Kleenex is a great idea, too.
The most humane contribution to
traveling mankind is probably dra
mamine (issued on doctor's prescrip
tion). It's good for seasickness, air
sickness, and can be used as sleeping
pills if your accommodations include

five or six snorers and a screeching
infant.
Last, but not least, you might take
along some pocket guide about places
to go—however, if you adhere to all
the rules and regulations in it about
eating and drinking, you'll die un
happily thirsty and unhappily
starved.
