# Globe Trotters Rate Nylon High
## 
### 
A seasoned "globe trotter" in 1950
remembers that it's a nylon year—
for everything from gloves to lin
gerie.
No smart traveler should be minus
this amazing material which sheds
wrinkles like a duck sheds water,
dries in a few hours and needs no
pressing. It can be packed in a small
place—even in a knapsack on a bike
tour
