### ART HENRY 
Classes aren'i over for many Eu
rope bound Stanfordites this sum
mer. Quite a few of them will spend
from 10 days to 12 months out of their
traveling time at foreign colleges and
universities.
Many courses can be taken for uni
versity credit to be accepted in this
country, and several of the European
universities are recognized under the
GI Bill.
Tuition costs involved are generally
very low. Average estimated costs
for tuition and maintenance is about
$180, the total amount varying with
location, length of course, and num
ber of side excursions.
Application JUould be made in most
cases directly to the school. Informa
tion for many schools is handled by
the Institute of International Educa
tion, 2 West 45th street, New York
City. The lIR at Stanford also has
information on the subject.
