# There's a B'ar Over Thar'! Whar'? In the City, by Gar!

Thirty-three fine miles blended
into three great roads (Bayshore, El
Camino, and Skyline). Remember,
you would-be summer students, Lhe
City is always at hand for night and
daytime playtime.
II you're in a tourist mood, don't
miss Coit Tower overlooking every
thing; Chinatown, the you-know

whatest in the world; Golden Gate
Park of the fabulous Aquarium and
the famed De Young Museum; Seal
Rock where the real seals have never
heard of Lefty G'Doul; Fleishhacker's
Zoo, where the animals live in reas
onable facsimiles of their native
habitat, and the miniature train
clanks around a scenic track.
If it's night life you're after, peek
at the International Settlement, a
yaudy string of nightclubs which can
never forget the San Francisco Ex
position took place over 10 years ago.
There are smoky little hangouts like
the Club Hangover and the Say
When where the hot jazz combo takes
ofi in a cloud of dust along about
the witching hour. There are the
hotels where you can get lost in
everything from the Men's Room to
the Crystal Room without setting
foot in an elevator.
