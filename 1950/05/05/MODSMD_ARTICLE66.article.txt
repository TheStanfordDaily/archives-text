# Hints to the Wise: Get Those Versatile Togs for Study-Time
## 
### CHARLOTTE KEMPNER 
The weather forecast for sum
mer quarter will be warm with
slightly cooler evenings — per
haps a nippy winter day to
prove the weather prophets are
all wrong.
It's always a good idea to bring
along the faithful short coat for eve
nings along El Camino or at the show.
Under the shorty you'll want a ver
satile half-dressy, half-casual dress
that will take you from classroom to
"coffee" date; for example, the navy
blue cotton iced with white pique—
add and subtract your pearl neck
lace and earrings.
This year the move has tended to
ward peasant .blouses and skirts. If
they are at all flattering to you (that
is, if they don't make you look like
a flour sack tied in the middle), bring
along several changes — ruffled
blouses and plain skirts. Sandals are
practically "musts" for the gypsy
look — besides, you'll swelter in sad
dle shoes and socks.
Whether you're athletic or only the
"scenery" type, you'll want at least
one bathing suit and a couple of pairs
of shorts. For swimming nylon bath
ing suits head the list, because they
dry in a wink, and never get moldy
looking. Denim shorts are always
wise, too; they take a lot of punish
ment, and look just as good faded as
when they were new. With the shorts
why don't you try a red-and-white
checked or a Hawaiian print sleeve
less shirt — they're inexpensive and
provide an interesting change of out
fit.
T-shirts are also making an unsur
passed debut this season. You can
find them in every style from that of
a wool jersey blouse to the skimpiest
halter-like affair. And you can wear
them with cotton skirts, pedal-push
ers, shorts, suits, and jeans. Try
dressing up these T-blouses by pin
ning on bright artificial flowers or
loading them down with fantastic
jewelry.
Church, City, or a tea will require
the traditional soft print dress—per
haps in rayon, perhaps in silk,
douhle-plus in nylon. Choose some
thing you feel extremely comfortable
in—summer prints are meant to he
worn casually, unselfconsciously —
and often! Set off your print with
gleaming white linen shoes; these
shoes can lead two lives: one with
short frocks, and one with summer
formals.
If you're lazy or pressed for time,
seersucker pajamas will fill your bill
for sleeping requirements. They're

cool and, best of all, they need no j
ironing.
Another new style that's proving
valuable for campus wear during
unpredictable weather is the match- j
ing sweater and wash dress combi
nation. 11 it's chilly when you start
lor your 8 o'clock, just slip on the
short bolero sweater . . . it's easy to j
carry it when the clay gets warmer. I

handy if you're planning on attend
ing the Lag formal. Why not pick a
dress that can lead a double life. Try
a strapless cotton formal with a stole; j
the formal can be shortened later j
for many, many wearings as a sun '

dress. If you prefer a formal that re
mains a formal, why not select a bal
lerina length organdy or lace dress?
Men can get away with a third the
luggage of women for spring quarter
(if you don't count in baseballs and
bats, footballs, and volleyballs).
When they have included a suit and
one or two sweaters plus the usual
cords, levis, khakis, and shirts, their
problems are almost over. A white
coat for formal occasions is purely
optional (although it looks great with
a tan).
But whatever else you do—Stan
ford rough or Farm "queen"—don't
forget your most valuable item of
clothing ... a bathing suit.

This year the move has tended to
ward peasant .blouses and skirts. If
they are at all flattering to you (that
is, if they don't make you look like
a flour sack tied in the middle), bring
along several changes — ruffled
blouses and plain skirts. Sandals are
practically "musts" for the gypsy
look — besides, you'll swelter in sad
dle shoes and socks.
Whether you're athletic or only the
"scenery" type, you'll want at least
one bathing suit and a couple of pairs
of shorts. For swimming nylon bath
ing suits head the list, because they
dry in a wink, and never get moldy
looking. Denim shorts are always
wise, too; they take a lot of punish
ment, and look just as good faded as
when they were new. With the shorts
why don't you try a red-and-white
checked or a Hawaiian print sleeve
less shirt — they're inexpensive and
provide an interesting change of out
fit.
T-shirts are also making an unsur
passed debut this season. You can
find them in every style from that of
a wool jersey blouse to the skimpiest
halter-like affair. And you can wear
them with cotton skirts, pedal-push
ers, shorts, suits, and jeans. Try
dressing up these T-blouses by pin
ning on bright artificial flowers or
loading them down with fantastic
jewelry.
Church, City, or a tea will require
the traditional soft print dress—per
haps in rayon, perhaps in silk,
douhle-plus in nylon. Choose some
thing you feel extremely comfortable
in—summer prints are meant to he
worn casually, unselfconsciously —
and often! Set off your print with
gleaming white linen shoes; these
shoes can lead two lives: one with
short frocks, and one with summer
formals.
If you're lazy or pressed for time,
seersucker pajamas will fill your bill
for sleeping requirements. They're

cool and, best of all, they need no j
ironing.
