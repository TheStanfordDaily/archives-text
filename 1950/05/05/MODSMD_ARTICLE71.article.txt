# Suntans and Socials Show It's Summer on the Farm
## 
### PATRISH VAN RONKEL 
The beaches see more students, the
cottons and white shirts suddenly ap
pear on Quad, converted conver
tibles gradually multiply; even the
weather previews the coming at
tractions of summer into another
month and another summer quarter.
Spring merges into summer with
only a slight change in amusement
tactics. Hayrides, formals, Rossotti's,
beach parties, continue with the same
amount of enthusiasm. Only the fra
ternity parties decline, but private
soirees take over. Exchanges — din
ners (that usually succeed in pairing
up a 5 ft. 6 in. fellow with a 5 ft.
10 in. girl), beer busts, and after
dinner coffees—are pulled in when
ever a lull seems forthcoming.
Even the Sunday Evening Movies
(we always like to give a plug to that
non-profit "public utility") continue.
And for the girls, there's the extra
drawing card of an improved ratio—
it usually ups to four to one during
the summer.
But as a whole, the population takes
a slump; the enrollment often mounts
to only 2,000. A much larger per
centage of the students are gradu
ates or teachers returning to pick up
extra courses.
So, look to the beaches and Rossot

ti's; they say that summer quarter is
the only time that can even outdo
spring!
