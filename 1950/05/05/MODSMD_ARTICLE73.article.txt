# New Clock-Wise Clothes For Day-to-Date Living
## 
### JULIE DOCKSTADER 
This summer the smart working
girl will be seen mostly in a mix
and-match, day-to-date wardrobe,
in which everything has a double
life.
For days, she'll love the new bare
arm blouses in starched pastels with
a bright skirt, and she will add a
sparkle of pretty artificial flowers
somewhere on the collar or at the
waist. Later in the day she'll put on
a pair of white gloves, take off the
flowers, and add a filmy scarf or a
small hat.
She'll love the tradition that says
n;:vy touched with white is always
news and she will know that a navy
dress leads a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde ex
istence when it is worn gloveless with
flat shoes at the office, later changed
with gleaming gloves, hat, and heels
lor evening wear.
She'll wear another perennial fa
vorite, the shirtwaist dress, starched
and lavender-scented, with more ar

tificial flowers, the spice for almost
every ISSO costume.
She'll shop for a bolero-ed sun
dress, in cotton to wear to the beach
on her day off, or in a silk print to
carry into evening, and she'll own a
pale suit in tweed or gabardine,
sparked with red accessories and a
peai 1 choker for day, jet beads and
black patent leather with black
gloves and a festive blouse at night.
She'll have a straight corduroy
coat, softly tailored in a summer
shade, and she will remember that
linen will be an essential part of her
wardrobe, that gleaming leather
deepens soft colors, that hair and hats
are snug, and that bright lipsticks
and artificial flowers will perk up any
wardrobe.
She'll get herself a knit dress—
either one piece or a suit — which
sheds wrinkles like a cluck sheds wa
ter, and which is very versatile.


Working a la Esguire is LYLE KINDER in a PHELPS-TERKEL
sport coat with matching slacks. The coat is brown Shetland
tweed . . . the slacks are yarn-dyed gabardine with a brown
overplaid.
