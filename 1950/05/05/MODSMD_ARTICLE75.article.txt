to 8 o'clocks, lootball season, Lake
Lag, and Cellar coffee-time — and
you're wondering about prospects for
a job in "the outside world."
Jobs this year, on the whole, will be
harder to obtain than they were last
year, according to James E. Lambert
of the Stanford Placement Service.
The half million men and women who

will finish their schooling in June
will make this year's graduating class
the largest in American history. Most
Stanford students, however, seem to
be doing quite well in getting the
positions which they desire.
Certain fields, of course, are much
more crowded than others.
In education, California schools
will need 8.100 elementary and 2,900
secondary 'teachers for the next

school year. Since teacher-trainii
