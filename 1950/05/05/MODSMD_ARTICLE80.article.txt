# Don't Let This Be 'White Collar You'
## 
### 
Some clever guy put out a book
called the "White Collar Zoo" not
long ago—it's evidently been selling
like dollar bills, mainly because most
people can look and see their com
rades in labor romping through the
slightly hysterical pages.
There are types and types—every
once in a while even the best of us
inadvertently slip into one of the un
| desirable brackets. What with gum
chewing, pitter-patter chatter, hang
j overs, that urge for coffee-time, and
I ve olde charme, the Great Prole
! tariat (and the bosses, too) can te
| most annoying to tho. e around them.
"What we love about women":
The sloppy beast*whose slips drag
| along at ha'lmast below a hemline
(.hat would put the tideline at a beach
to shan.e. Top this ail off with a
night - after-pickles - and - whipped
j cream dream of a dress, and a hat
with purple and red leather, and
what have you got?— Miss Outcast of
Poke Flat or Miss Fit of 19. r )0. Don't
| look now, but she might be the gaJ
j pounding the typewriter in back of
you.
Then there's (he Kappa Kappa
j Gamma who will always be the
Kappa Kappa Gamma (i! it kills her
and we often wish it would). She's
the bright little creature who shows
up at work in the latest copy of
| Jacques Fath, and gaily informs you
that although she probably won't eat
for the next month, at least she'll be
"chichi."
And there's always "old evil eye,"
usually some old maid well past f)U
who disapproves of dates, drinking,
smoking, drinking, talking, drinking,
and living. She frequently shows up
in an ankle-length lavender dress
with a tidy around her neck (hut
that's a nasty word).
Last but not least we have the "two
speeds duo," who in turn sound like
a record played slow and a jazzed-up
disc. The former may say "hello" to
j you once a week if you're lucky—
I this may be accompanied by a slight
| sneer, showing one tooth. The lat
i ter "type" yaks like a perpetual mo
| tion machine—you know: "Ohlhad
