# Reconverted Mansions, College Clubs, YWCA's Serve to House the City-Bound Working Platoon

You graduate, you find work, and
you find too that the useful adage,
"Home is Where you go and they
have to take you in," is no help now.
So you write your own as time and
| salary permit.
4 How has it been done? Look at re
cent college graduates with jobs in
three life pockets of the country.
San Francisco, city of gingerbread
mansions, has recruited many of
these as boarding houses for young
working people. The name is repell
ing but your corner of the renovated
mansion can be made as much yours
I as a college dormitory, and with the
same tools.
The homes may or may not be co
educational. Rooms, housing from
one to lour girls on an average of
$75 to $85, a month, are nearly all
furnished. With breakfast and din
ner a community arrangement, the
questions that meet you can te an
swered by college experience.
This is the rule. The exception

owns a car. She follows an ad to a
Sausalito apartment, low-priced be
cause it is accessible only by car.
The Greenwich fable of the under
the-sidewalk candle-lit melange of
professional -amateurs in New York
City can and has come true. But it's
1 a long subway ride from most of
Manhattan's work and the price of
, atmosphere is often high. Still cus
tom dictates shared apartments
through the whole range of quality,
from the Village "garret" to the up
town flat.
A recent graduate, using the Bar
bizon Hotel for women or the "Y" as
: a base of operations, looks
the city's college clubs at the always
furnished apartments. The Smith
[ Club, the V-assar Club, clubs of all
major colleges have smoothed the

dilemma of the homeless by lining up
all possible living space for inspec
tion.
Three or four girls together shoul
der the rent of $90 to $100, share the
housework, and divide the couch and
the kitchen as the tempo of their so
cial life and working day demands.
We can re-cross the continent and
look at "Ipswich" as a specimen of a
peculiarly Los Angeles arrangement.
Ancestor of the traditional barn, Ips
wich is a small house renting for
around $125. Four girls, from the
same living group in college, moved

in and found enough privacy and
companionship in two bedrooms and
single living room to satisfy them all.
Collectively the artistic and domes
tic and social bents of each found
outlet, and as each worked and mar
ried and moved out her place was
filled by another.
