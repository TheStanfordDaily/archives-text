■ u miner, you ought to try the My.s
ery Spot near Santa Cruz, a place
vhere the law of gravity has been
•epealed, and you're liable to suffer
rom 45 degreeitis.
The guide will take you lo a little
hack atop a tipsy knoll. The inside
ooks like an art exercise in geo
netric abstraction. On one side is a
adder you can climb without grasp

inn the side rails with your hands.
The whole trip turns into a whacky
nightmare when the tour leader
casually rolls marbles up a slide, and
tosses a baseball over a fence to prove
.it will come floating back into his
hands. (And unless he's invisible,
there's no little man stationed behind
the to pitch the ball back.)
When you're climbing back down
the trail that led to the Picasso-ish

j house, you'll begin to notice that the
! person in front of you has a weird
| tendency to lean precariously for-
I ward. The blow comes when you
| realize you, too, are walking at the
) same slant—terra firma never felt so
! odd.
