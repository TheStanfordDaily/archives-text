### DIANE JESSEN 
Maybe you're one of the esti-!
mated 3,000 Stanford students
who v/ill edge into a resort,
camp, forestry, or cannery job
come June. Or you may be one
:if the 3,000 others who wish
they had one of these blessings I
to the college pocketbook
stored up for the lean summer
months.
Fer obvious reasons, the resort
jo!;:-: are the fnort popular, and if I
your application isn't in by January |
or february you might as well sit
back r.nd wait lor the next year to !
roll around. Yosemite and Lake Ta
hoc areas are the most popular, but
alter this any one of .'JO or so resorts
li t"d with tne Student Employment
Service v/ill probably do. Unless you
like to take finals two weeks eaily, j
you can forget about the Utah parks.)
A: you thumb through the always- !
enticing resort lolder, you realize it's j
ill this and a month, too (maybe*
aii(l you try to decide if the cover j
hare is worth it. Chances at hash- j
in- 1 are much better if you've had j
experience, but you don't have to
know a thing to be a bellhop or dish -
washer (you probably have a feel
ing you'd do just fine), Your chances
â€¢ire 25 pel cent better if they like
your looks and personality. Almost
>11 .summer jobs require you to be 18, !
and some insist on 21.
The next biggest group is the sales i
and office work categories, then camp |
counselling positions and forestry I
jobs.
The science majors usually will j
take anything that will yive them ex- I
pciience in their respective fields,!
and these jobs come in very early, j
The national government has many j
postions, but there's red tape and
civil service exams to take. Some of
the larger companies have summer
trainee programs, (last year Procter
and Gamble, Carnation Company, j
Signal Oil, etc.), but the competition
is stiff. If you've completed your
junior year your chances are in
finitely improved.
Camp jobs are the most available,
particularly among the Girl Scouts, j
YM's, and YW's. Camp employers j
like to interview students in March
or April, and jobs are still open for
this year. Day camps and city rec- j
reation departments also provide |
many lifeguard and day counsellor !

openings.
Forestry openings include such
things as blister rust prevention and
fire fighting, and positions are usu
ally filled by March.
Cannery work has two definite ad
vantages: it pays well and is usually
local. It's also guaranteed to give
your mental structure a complete
rest. However, you may have union
troubles. There's not much you can
do ahead of time on cannery jobs:
lust apply the day the season opens.
