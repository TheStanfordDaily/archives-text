# Whose 'Ittie Baby Are 'Oo?

There's one sure cure for ulcers,
finals-week hangover, and what ails
you—what? kids' games, that's what.
Hares and Hounds is a rare old
standby. Sometime when you're in
a good clean party mood, get what's
left of the old gang together, and di
vide into prey and preyer. The hares
get a 10-minute handicap and a box

of chalk. While the rampant bun
nies are on the run, they wildly draw
arrows on the sidewalks, fences, gar
bage cans, etc., that they happen to
pass over. The yapping hounds try to
follow the arrows and catch the
hares. When the game's over, losers
buy winners a beer.
You'll get a lot oi kicks out of this
one: it's called "consequences," and
there's no particular object for it ex
cept laughs. Everyone gets a piece
of paper and a pencil. At the top of
the page you write the name of a
man—any man, even Mickey Mouse.
Fold over and pass to the next per
son, who writes down "meets," then
the name of a gal; fold and continue
the same old routine with meeting
place, "he said to her," "she said to
him," and finally,"the world said."
Wait till you get Ingrid meeting
Lassie behind Lake Lag—
