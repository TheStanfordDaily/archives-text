### JANET HANSON 
Hay time, party time, beach time! That's summer vacation and time to take it easy from those
classes and build up sun tans. »
With Rio, Santa Cruz, and Balboa running competition with Tahoe and Yosemite, playclothes be
come about as important as Quad cloths to a coed s wardrobe. And this year she has a more excit
ing variety of styles, color combinations, and materials to choose from.
Beach clothes are the most essential items of cl othes to play in. Bathing suits are nylon whicta

j means they're better looking, better
j fitting, arid are supposed to hold their
shape loiv;t r than any previous mod
] els. A nice additions to any beach
wardrobe is a terry cloth beach coat
J or pullover shirt to go over a wet
j bathing suit on a windy day at San
| Gregorio. Belted or flared, they
I conic in prints, warm pastels, or
classic white. News in beach robes
, are heavy linen, sailcloth, or denim.
For looks and serviceability, den
: ims lead the field in playclothes—
j denim pedal pushers and jeans, denim
j wraparound skirts to go over match
-1 ing shorts, fitted shortsleeve jackets,
and little matching sailing caps, all
I come in bright colored denim.
Shorts mix with blouse or shirt
! separates in just about any color or
material from denim to silk shim
lung. It's back to the '20's in draw
sting blouses that are fuller, high
necked. and sleeveless. A jersey
middy blouse adds another flapper
touch to a pair of shorts. Boat-
J necked jersey blouses are good, too,
I and can be worn with skirts as well.
Checks are still tops in popularity.
| Big checked gingham jackets make
{ cool toppers for matching playsuits.
J Small checked cotton dresses in pas
tels or navy are seen everywhere,
j Cottons, like everything else this
| spring, are blousier and 112 uller, oc
j easionally pleated, and usually
| sleeveless.
New this year are sweater dresses,
short - sleeved shortie cardigan
! sweaters go over everything from
shorts and cottons to dressy sun
i dresses.
Cotton goes any place this year
I from a picnic to a cocktail party. A
| pretty cotton with a stole is equally
at home on a sightseeing tour or on
| dance floor. Eyelet, cotton taffeta, and
organdie overskirts dress up a cot-
I lon wardrobe. Artificial flowers
! tucked in the belt, pocket, or neck
line lend a more feminine touch, and
of course, white linen opera pumps to
I go with it.
The new flared length jackets are a
touch of variety but are only good
with certain styles and require a bet
ter than average figure. The classic
white shortie is still the best buy, for
it goes equally well over cotton
dresses or formals.
