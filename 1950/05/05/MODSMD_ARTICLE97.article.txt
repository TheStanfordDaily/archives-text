# California Here We Come For Our Vacation Fun!
## 
### MARGIE BOTTS 
If you are planning to work hard
nl doing nothing this summer, Cali
fornia is the state to find your place
in the sun.
From the lofty peaks of the Sierra
Nevtidas to the shores of the Pacific,
hundreds of vacationers will discover,
once again, that it's lucky when you
loaf in California.
If you like your loafing slightly on
the strenuous side, outdoors from sun
to summit with nights under the
' tars, why not try the High Sierra
Trail from Giant Forest to Mt. Whit
ney. Of if you prefer to blaze your
own trail, a pack trip to the High
Sierra lakes will give you wonderful
scenery and good trout fishing as
well.
Those who like their mountains
seasoned with easy living and a dash
ol night life, will find Lake Tahoe,
Arrowhead, or Yosemite Valley more
to their tastes. If you should grow
tired of swimming, sailing, water
.skiing, horseback riding, and party
ing at Tahoe, it's less than an hour's
drive to the blinking signs and clink
ing silver dollars of the Biggest-Lit
-1 le-City-in-the-World.
While you're in Reijo, don't miss
the annual Fourth of July celebra
tions, and on the way, drop in at Vir
ginia City for a look at a commer
cialized ghost town boasting crystal
chandeliers, gold door knobs, and 50-
cent whiskey sours in milkshake
glasses.
This summer hundreds of Stan
fordites will be labelled "Reds," but
the charges will be sunburns instead

of subversive activities. Heading the
pink-tinged list will be the inhabi
tants of Southern California beaches,
such as Balboa, La Jolla, Laguna, and
Huntington.
If you're loafing at Laguna, reserve
a few hours from July 2G lo August J)
to visit the Festival of Arts where
"living pictures" are presented night
ly at the Pageant of the Masters by
Lagunans who pose in paintings
ranging from Leonardo da Vinci to
Norman Rockwell.
For the fishing or sailing enthus
iast, Southern California provides
San Diego, Newport, Coronado, Long
Beach, and Santa Barbara. Santa
Barbara also offers the "Old Spanish
Days," a three-day fiesta during the
full moon in August.
Northern California guarantees
similar enjoyments of sun, sand, and
sea at spots such as Santa Cruz, Mon
terey, and Carmel-by-the-Sea.
If your rebate refund doesn't af
ford passage to Hawaii, but you still
yearn to travel via the Pacific, why
not settle for a cruise to Catalina?
You can rent a motor boat at Avalon
and explore part of the 22-mile-long
island, loaf on the beach, or wander
through quaint shops in the town.
(You'll probably be just as happy if
you skip the glass-bottom boats.)
Might finish off your day with din
ner dancing at the Catalina Casino.
If you would rather burn and
bronze without the benefits of an
ocean, try a few days at Palm
Springs, or hit the mountain trails to
Sequoia, Mammoth, or Huntington
Lakes.

tired of swimming, sailing, water
.skiing, horseback riding, and party
ing at Tahoe, it's less than an hour's
drive to the blinking signs and clink
ing silver dollars of the Biggest-Lit
-1 le-City-in-the-World.
While you're in Reijo, don't miss
the annual Fourth of July celebra
tions, and on the way, drop in at Vir
ginia City for a look at a commer
cialized ghost town boasting crystal
chandeliers, gold door knobs, and 50-
cent whiskey sours in milkshake
glasses.
This summer hundreds of Stan
fordites will be labelled "Reds," but
the charges will be sunburns instead

of subversive activities. Heading the
pink-tinged list will be the inhabi
tants of Southern California beaches,
such as Balboa, La Jolla, Laguna, and
Huntington.
If you're loafing at Laguna, reserve
a few hours from July 2G lo August J)
to visit the Festival of Arts where
"living pictures" are presented night
ly at the Pageant of the Masters by
Lagunans who pose in paintings
ranging from Leonardo da Vinci to
Norman Rockwell.
For the fishing or sailing enthus
iast, Southern California provides
San Diego, Newport, Coronado, Long
Beach, and Santa Barbara. Santa
Barbara also offers the "Old Spanish
Days," a three-day fiesta during the
full moon in August.
Northern California guarantees
similar enjoyments of sun, sand, and
sea at spots such as Santa Cruz, Mon
terey, and Carmel-by-the-Sea.
If your rebate refund doesn't af
ford passage to Hawaii, but you still
yearn to travel via the Pacific, why
not settle for a cruise to Catalina?
You can rent a motor boat at Avalon
and explore part of the 22-mile-long
island, loaf on the beach, or wander
through quaint shops in the town.
(You'll probably be just as happy if
you skip the glass-bottom boats.)
Might finish off your day with din
ner dancing at the Catalina Casino.
If you would rather burn and
bronze without the benefits of an
ocean, try a few days at Palm
Springs, or hit the mountain trails to
Sequoia, Mammoth, or Huntington
Lakes.
If you are planning to work hard
nl doing nothing this summer, Cali
fornia is the state to find your place
in the sun.
From the lofty peaks of the Sierra
Nevtidas to the shores of the Pacific,
hundreds of vacationers will discover,
once again, that it's lucky when you
loaf in California.
If you like your loafing slightly on
the strenuous side, outdoors from sun
to summit with nights under the
' tars, why not try the High Sierra
Trail from Giant Forest to Mt. Whit
ney. Of if you prefer to blaze your
own trail, a pack trip to the High
Sierra lakes will give you wonderful
scenery and good trout fishing as
well.
Those who like their mountains
seasoned with easy living and a dash
ol night life, will find Lake Tahoe,
Arrowhead, or Yosemite Valley more
to their tastes. If you should grow
tired of swimming, sailing, water
.skiing, horseback riding, and party
ing at Tahoe, it's less than an hour's
drive to the blinking signs and clink
ing silver dollars of the Biggest-Lit
