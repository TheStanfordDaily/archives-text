# Hints On How To Loaf And Love It As You Spend The Summer At Home
## 
### 
For that ever-youthful, casual look,
be sure to set aside an hour each day j
for sheer, utter relaxation. Just one |
hour a day will remove those ugly |
. j
wrinkles from around your eyes—it i
even prevents falling hair.
Choose a comfortable couch —or
floor, if your rugs have thick, rich
piling. Lower yourself down slowly |
to prevent strained muscles —don't i
forget, muscle twitches often distract
from your absolute relaxation.
Once in a prone position, close your
eyes, and make your oh-so-ever-ac
tive mind a complete blank, Or
think beautiful thoughts — beautiful
thoughts, you know, make beautiful

people. Don't let little things disturb
you. Rip out that jangling telephone;
pull down the blinds to shut out that
too-bright sunlight—you can only re
lax in the deepest of darks.
Just think — you are on vacation;
you do not have any homework; you
do not have any tests; you do not have
any term papers; you do not have any
classes—are you at ease now?
For added relax-ation insurance:
uppily a cool, soothing damp washrag
to your forehead—it's so refreshing.

Perhaps you may tune in the radio on
a program of lulling symphonic music.
Don't look now, dear reader, but
your one hour is up. Time to be up
and 'at 'em!
