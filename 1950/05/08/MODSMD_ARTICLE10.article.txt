## 
### 
ASSU President-elect Ted Butt
ner will spend 15 hours working at
the Con Home this quarter as a
result of some last - minute cam
paigning by a supporter during
election week.
Men's Council Thursday night
upheld a decision of the Election
Judgment Board of Excoin which
found Buttner guilty of violating
the election by-law covering de
facement of Universtiy property
and grounds during campaigns.
Writing on classroom blackboards
and posting small cards in Quad
rooms was the charge. A Buttner
supporter living at Eneina allegedly
did the illegal campaigning the
night before election.
Hears of Action
Buttner said he found out about
the action about 10:.'}0 that.night and
with the help of the student imme
diately took down all the cards he
could find and erased some of the
blackboard notices.
At 7:30 the next morning some of
the remaining blackboard signs
were erased, but a few rooms were
evidently missed, according to evi
dence presented.
Greg Bemis told Men's Council
that Excom's interpretation of the
by-law was that the ruling covered
the writing on the boards, and that
Buttner should serve a 15-hour sen
tence.
Are Blackboard's Included?
Buttncr's campaign manager. Bill
Swigart, told Men's Council that he
did not. believe the "defacement of
University property" clause covered
writing on blackboards.
"I don't believe it is a violation of
the rules as they arc now written,"
he said.
Swigart conceded that if Buttner
had failed to remove any of the
cards from Quad rooms, he was re
sponsible for them.
Men's Council upheld the com
mittee and ruled that the candidate
was responsible for the actions and
that the intent of the by-law was
clear enough to govern this case.
Jonas Violates Role
Gil Jonas, successful off-campus
Excom candidate, also lost, an ap
peal to the Council regarding vio
lation of the same election rule.
Jonas and some supporters had
placed handbills inside parked cars.
Many of the bills were thrown out
of the autos and complaints were
made by other candidates.
When Jonas appeared before the
Council he sought a clarification of
the charges against him, admitting
that lie put the bills in autos with
full knowledge that it was his re
sponsibility if they littered the
ground.
He protested that his action in
passing out the bills was a service
to the students, but admitted his
guilt on technical grounds. His sen
tence of 15 hours was upheld.
The Election Judgment Board

also gave a 15-hour sentence to a
campaign worker for another can
didate. This student violated cam
paign rules by tearing down cam
paign signs.
Parking Violations
An appeal to reverse two parking
violation charges against another
student was also denied by Men's
Council.
The decision in this case was
reached after the Council moved
in a body to the alley back of the
Bookstore. The decision was given
on the spot after inspection of the
exact place where the auto was
parked and the position of "no
parking" signs.
The student claimed that there
had been no enforcement of the
parking regualtions in the alley for
over a year. He argued that he
should have received warning.
The Council voted that the stu
dent had received tickets on two
successive days, and that a number
of other people also had been tagged
by the police. Both fines of $2 apiece
were upheld.

over a year. He argued that he
should have received warning.
The Council voted that the stu
dent had received tickets on two
successive days, and that a number
of other people also had been tagged
by the police. Both fines of $2 apiece
were upheld.
ASSU President-elect Ted Butt
ner will spend 15 hours working at
the Con Home this quarter as a
result of some last - minute cam
paigning by a supporter during
election week.
Men's Council Thursday night
upheld a decision of the Election
Judgment Board of Excoin which
found Buttner guilty of violating
the election by-law covering de
facement of Universtiy property
and grounds during campaigns.
Writing on classroom blackboards
and posting small cards in Quad
rooms was the charge. A Buttner
supporter living at Eneina allegedly
did the illegal campaigning the
night before election.
Hears of Action
Buttner said he found out about
the action about 10:.'}0 that.night and
with the help of the student imme
diately took down all the cards he
could find and erased some of the
blackboard notices.
At 7:30 the next morning some of
the remaining blackboard signs
were erased, but a few rooms were
evidently missed, according to evi
dence presented.
Greg Bemis told Men's Council
that Excom's interpretation of the
by-law was that the ruling covered
the writing on the boards, and that
Buttner should serve a 15-hour sen
tence.
Are Blackboard's Included?
Buttncr's campaign manager. Bill
Swigart, told Men's Council that he
did not. believe the "defacement of
University property" clause covered
writing on blackboards.
"I don't believe it is a violation of
the rules as they arc now written,"
he said.
Swigart conceded that if Buttner
had failed to remove any of the
cards from Quad rooms, he was re
sponsible for them.
Men's Council upheld the com
mittee and ruled that the candidate
was responsible for the actions and
that the intent of the by-law was
clear enough to govern this case.
Jonas Violates Role
Gil Jonas, successful off-campus
Excom candidate, also lost, an ap
peal to the Council regarding vio
lation of the same election rule.
Jonas and some supporters had
placed handbills inside parked cars.
Many of the bills were thrown out
of the autos and complaints were
made by other candidates.
When Jonas appeared before the
Council he sought a clarification of
the charges against him, admitting
that lie put the bills in autos with
full knowledge that it was his re
sponsibility if they littered the
ground.
He protested that his action in
passing out the bills was a service
to the students, but admitted his
guilt on technical grounds. His sen
tence of 15 hours was upheld.
The Election Judgment Board

also gave a 15-hour sentence to a
campaign worker for another can
didate. This student violated cam
paign rules by tearing down cam
paign signs.
Parking Violations
An appeal to reverse two parking
violation charges against another
student was also denied by Men's
Council.
The decision in this case was
reached after the Council moved
in a body to the alley back of the
Bookstore. The decision was given
on the spot after inspection of the
exact place where the auto was
parked and the position of "no
parking" signs.
The student claimed that there
had been no enforcement of the
parking regualtions in the alley for
over a year. He argued that he
should have received warning.

dent had received tickets on two
successive days, and that a number
of other people also had been tagged
