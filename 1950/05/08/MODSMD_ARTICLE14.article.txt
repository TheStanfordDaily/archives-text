The king - queen voting -stand
"truck became the center attrac
tion of a three-ring circus Friday
afternoon after gasoline began
leaking from its tank.
The lire department service
truck was the first to arrive at the
Lasuen-Panama site in front of
the Union, followed closely by
Chief John Mars ton.
While firemen struggled vainly
with a faulty nozzle while trying
to sprav water on the gasoline,
the assorted collection of vehicles
did a docey-do and promenade
home.
The show shortly rolled to an
end as firemen threw away the
nozzle and did their duty with
the headless hose. In the confu
sion, kii?,'( candidate Lloyd Combs
picked up an unofficial 2,150,000
votes and the truck maneuvered
hack to its old postâ€”in front of a
fireplug.
