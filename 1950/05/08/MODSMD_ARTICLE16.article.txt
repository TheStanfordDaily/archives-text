# FOREIGN SCHOLARSHIP COMMITTEE
## Stanford Sends U.S. Ideas Abroad 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
A personal touch of Europe comcs
to Stanforrl via the foreign s<holar
| ship students each year, wliile they
j in turn get a better view of the
I American way of life.
This exchange of ideas is made
j possible through the work of the
Foreign Scholarship Committee. An
independent organization of the
ASSU, it is supported by the entire
University: the administration, the
living groups, and the student body.
The Foreign Scholarship Program
j was set up in January IMS by eight
students and flu- Dean of Students.
! Their purpose has been to further
j a mutual understanding between
j students of different countries as
one basis for world understanding
j and peace.
The program, as it has been ear
| rietl out, requires the co-operation
: of all campus groups. Each group
has given its support, voluntarily
i contributing its share of the finances
I and the work.
The University offers one-half of
j the total tuition; the fraternities and
. living groups provide room and
board as well as some spending
j money; and the student body pays
from student funds the remaining
amount needed for transportation,
tuition, spending money, and inci
dentals for the foreign students.
The success of the program and
I its popularity abroad is evidenced
| by the many applications that are
j pourinu into the lIR shack daily
from European students.
Foreign students are selected in
| the fol'owing manner: the commit -
j tee selects from the applications
j those students who meet these four
general requirements â€” (1) field of
study should be in the "social sci
ences"; (2) the student must never
! have been in the U.S.; (3) the stu

dent must be under iifi years of age
and must not be married; (4) be
should be able to speak English.
These requirements aim a' bring
ing over students who have never
had intimate contacts with our way
of life. Applicants are expected to
return to their native land after a
year of study at Stanford and be
active in their respective countries.
The second screening is then done
by the Dean of Men and the Wom
en's Counselor.
Meanwhile living groups which
wish to house students arc lined up
and they make the final decision.
Living groups will make their de
cisions on next year's students this
month.
Arrangements are made with j
Stanford alumni groups throughout
the country to meet the students
when they leave the boat, to enter
tain and guide them while they are
on their way to Stanford. This is
the initial state of their introduction
to America.
The seven foreign students now |
participating in the Stanford pro- 1
gram arc: Herman Ermolajev from
Russia; Fotini Kaplanidou, Athens,
Greece; Ranveig Drewry, Oslo, Nor
way; Bent Pontoppidan, Lyngby,
Denmark; Fritz Margulies, Bavaria,
Germany; Gottfried Karl Kinder
mann, Vienna, Austria; Philippe J
Berthet from France.
Plans for next year's program are
now being made, under the direc
tion of Phil Nielsen and Earl Ilaga
dorn, newly appointed co-chairmen |
of the Foreign Scholarship Com- j
mitt.ee.
Excom has voted the committee a j
budget of $5,460 to bring over five |
students, one of whom will be an |
exchange student. Stanford stu- ]
dents wishing to participate in this
exchange should contact the 11H of
