Court of Appeals. The public is in
vited.
Appellants in this evening's case
will be Merrill Morshead Jr. and

and John D. Ehrlichman v/ill be the
respondents.
The case to be argued tonight
concerns a white ipen and his fian
cee, who was one - fourth Indian,
who applied for a marriage license
in the imaginary state of Stanford.
A Stanford official refused to is
sue the license because there was
a statute in the state of Stanford
which prohibited marriage between
whites and other races.
The aggrieved couple complained
to the Federal District Attorney,
who instituted prosecution of the
official under the Federal Criminal
Code which makes it a federal
crime to deprive a person of any
federal right under code of law.
The theory of prosecution is that
the anti - miscegenation statute of
Stanford violates the 14th amend
ment to the Federal Constitution,
and persons therefore have a fed
eral right to marry inter-racially.
The Stanford official is then liable
for denying a federal right under
color of local law.
The preliminary rounds of the
Moot Court will continue all this
week, beginning at 8:15 each night.
