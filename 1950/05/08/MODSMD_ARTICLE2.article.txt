# Acheson Reaches Paris
## 
### 
PAKISâ€”Dean Acheson, U.S. Sec
retary of State, /lew into Paris to
day evidently determined to get
more help from other Western pow
ers in the cold war.
The British - French - American
foreign ministers' conference will
open in London later in the week
and continue until May 17 or later.
A meeting of Atlantic Pact foreign
ministers will begin May 15 and last
at least three days.
Though the Secretary himself said
nothing, the American position was
made clear by qualified sources. The
U.S. wants members of the Atlantip
Pact and any others interested in
stemming Soviet expansion to tight
en up their saddles and ride off to
the cold wars with a little more
resolution.
