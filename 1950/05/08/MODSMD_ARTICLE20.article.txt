# Bryan Leads Stanford To Big Meet Victory
## Campbell Chandler, and Gay Bryan Set Records as Indians Win, 80 to 51 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Ironman Gay Bryan finished out his Stanford dual meet track
career in a blaze of glory Saturday as he led his teammates to an
80 to 51 victory over Brutus Hamilton's strong California cinder
men.
Before an estimated 9,000 fans in Stanford Stadium, Bryan came

through with a magnificent 19-point
performance, which included first
places in the broad and high jumps,
and seconds in the 100, the 220, and
the low hurdles.
The Card ace took only two tries
at the broad jump, but his second
leap of 25 ft. 2V4 in. was good enough
to break the 12-year Big Meet broad
jump record.
Furlong a Heartbrcaker
Bryan was clocked unofficially at
;09.6 for his closc second place cl
fort to Cal's Donnie Anderson in the
100-yard dash, and later lost a
heartbreaker to Anderson in the fu;
long.
In the high jump, few people in
the Stadium saw Bryan sail over the
bar at 6 ft. 2V4 in., because a race
was going on at the same time. But
it won him the event.
In his final race, the low hurdles,
Bryan cruised at three-quartei .
speed to take second place to hi
brother Bob. Cal's hurdle ace, Ted
Rademaker, did not compete in either
highs or lows, because of a knee in
jury.
The Big Meet victory, however,
was shaded by other Stanford come
through performers. Polevaulter Don
Campbell recorded a best-ever leap
of 13 ft. 10 in. to beat favored Bill
Paddock of the Bears, who had to be
satisfied with second place.
Lyons Edges Scamnunt
A 1 Lyons, veteran Card distance
runner, had the crowd standing on its
feet with his thrilling one-yard vic
tory over Cal's Dan Seamount for
second place in the two-mile. Bill
Stauffer of the Bears won the event,
handily in 9:37.2.
Indian John Woolley put on a last
lap spurt to run away from Cal's Bob
Halpin for second spot in the mile.
Paul Mello of the Bears won the race
in 4:25.1, and later came back to
teammates Phil Arnot and Torn
Clark for first place in the 880.
Cards Jack Burke and Frank
Bradley gave Stanford a one-two in
the discus which added to the rout
Burke got off his best throw of the
season, 151 ft. \\'-z in. and Bradley
grabbed second place with a 143 It.
5% in. toss.
Shot Record Smashed
In the shot, Otis Chandler broke
the Big Meet record of 54 ft. 11 V- in ,
set by Lew Davis of the Indians last
year.
Besides the expected shotpul
sweep, Stanford shut out the Bears
in both the low hurdles and the quai
ter mile. Soph Jim Pollock lunged -it
the tape to grab third place in the
lows after the Bryan brothers had
taken one-two.
In the quarter. Pitch Johnson, Cas
Bly, and Stan Dawson outdistanced
Berkeley competitors Don Jackson
and Bob Fulton. Johnson won in
:49.0.
The Bears' biggest victory of the
day was in the mile relay when they
slaughtered Stanford's makeshift
team, composed of Bill Storum, Fred
Fank, Bud Cohen, and Stan Daw
son.
