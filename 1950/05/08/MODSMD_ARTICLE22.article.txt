## The 						Gentleman 
### 
It seems that no word has been more corrupted
through common usage than the word "gentleman."
A noted modern, when asked to define his conception
of a gentlman, said: "A gentleman never strives too
much. He does nothing too well. His perfect manners
are acquired at the price of the stuff of which heroes
are made." His definition is some indication as to how
the conception of a gentleman has shrunk. The word
"gentleman" is only one of many noble words which
have been hackneyed out of all meaning by careless
repetition.
The Renaissance produced the many-sided gentle
man, who was at once a scholar, a soldier, an artist, a
sportsman, a poet, a musician, and a philosopher.
Later, a divorce occurred between things intellectual
and things physical. Physical achievements were con
sidered outmoded. Fine manners and a good educa
tion were the only qualifications for being a gentle
man.
But the conception of a gentleman shrank further,
until the present day when the grand old name of
gentleman can be applied to any half-wit who gapes
at the mention of philosophy, or music, or art, and
who cannot even take sports seriously. The modern
idea! of a gentlman is a tiifler who is possessed of a
superficial suaveness.
Fortunately, however, the world as yet does not
consist of such half-wits, nor is the average gentleman
such a "gentleman." But that, this is the ideal most
current is obvious, and how dangerous it is many are

aware.
The degeneration of the intellectual and physical
worth of a gentleman would have mattered little if
there had not been a degeneration of the moral worth
as well. Previously a gentleman had to possess quali
ties of kindness, forbearance, and charity. Humanity
was sacred to him. He not only had outward politeness
but he had what the French called politesse de coeur.
Nowadays the gentleman no longer has to have such
requirements. The word "gentleman" is just a loose
term carelessly tossed about.
In China, however, the conception of a gentleman
has not deteriorated quite as much as in the Western
world. The precepts of gentlemanly conduct as laid
down by Confucius are pretty well preserved, al
though little stress is placed on the gentleman's physi
cal abilities other than that he should be able to with
stand hardships.
Among his other teachings, Confucius taught that a
gentleman takes as much trouble to discover what is
right as other men take to discover what would pay.
In his youth, a gentleman is on his guard against lust;
in his prime, he is on his guard against and in
his old age, he is on his guard against avarice. Con
fucius also pictured a gentleman as being calm, con
ciliatory, and dignified.
Notwithstanding the wails which are occasionally
heard from the fair sex, gcntlemanliness is not quite
dead yet. Perhaps it is still possible to restore the
word "gentleman" to its former pedestal of glory.
