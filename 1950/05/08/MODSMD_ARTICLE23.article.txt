# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
The only other Mathias ever to make history was a
Hapsburg king who ruled over th» Holy Roman Em
piie from IGI2 to lt>l9.
Since that time the Mathias strain has led a rather
normal existence that is, until brother Bob stepped

onto the scene. Last Saturday,
Hob Mathias, 1950 vintage, was
truly kingly in (he Little Big
Meet.
He scored 28 points all by him
self, broke two meet records, won
five different events, placed sec
ond in another, and led the l'rosh
to their first win over California
since about as far back as the
original Mathias was kinging it up
with the Holy Romans.
Mathias, racing around between

events like a Great Dane with a pack of tin cans tied
to his tail, did everything but shovel sawdust into the
jump pits, and he may have done that, too.
Mathias set his new meet records in the discus and
high hurdles, erasing 14- and 19-year-old standards,
and bettering Saturday's Big Meet and varsity marks
in both efforts.
He picked up firsts in the polo vault, low hurdles,
and the shotput. His second came in the high jump.
You might say that Bob Mathias, oniy 18 years along,
is fast on his way to becoming a legend. One day he
undoubtedly will be talked about in the same hushed
arid hallowed tones which are used to describe Jim
Thorpe, the Carlisle Indian, and Jesse Owens, the dark
demon from Ohio State.
Already an Olympic champion in the Decathlon, a

veteran campaigner, holder of numerous high school
records, and most-publicized Stanford frosh athlete in
history, Mathias nevertheless is unassuming and hard
working.
With it all, the future of Stanford Track seems to be
in for a nice ride, and as far as Bob Mathias is con
cerned, an old statement of A 1 Jolson fits perfectly:
"You ain't heard nothing yet!"

Speaking of track, as we were, it might be nice to
say something about the persons who were wise
enough to smuggle portable radios into the meet Sat
urday so that they could listen to the Kentucky Derby.
The 100-yard dash and the Derby started together.
Your Host and Gay Bryan were neck-and-neck, and I
was almost worked into a nervous collapse trying to
keep up with both. Finally, the 100 ended, and nothing
was left but Phlegm McCarthy (He always sounds as if
he's clearing his throat) yelling out the stretch drive—
"It's Mr. Trouble and Hill Prince, Mr. Trouble and Hill
Prince, Hill Prince and Mr. Trouble—and the Winner
is MIDDLEGROUND." Good old Clem, he just doesn't
have it. *

MONDAY MOAN: Somebody ought to suggest that
CarlunV* adopt a system for seating persons for
crowded Saturday und Sunday dinners. The way it
is now you have to race for every table, and the other
guy always seems to get there first. Maybe they ought
to install the Fundamental Standard or something.
Preferably something.
FINAL PITCH: It's true that we all come from the
same mould, but unfortunately some of us are a little
mouldier than others.
