# CAMPUS OPINION
## Women's Housing 
### 
To the Editor:
Though there are undoubtedly many who would
agree with Mary Kraft that the proposed change may
not be the best possible one for the housing problem,
I hope there are sounder reasons than those listed in
The Daily editorial of Thursday, May 4, ("Senior
women are too busy to do all the dirty work").
The proposed drawing system is certainly not aimed
at "getting Seniors on the Row." It is a proposal 1o
make more girls happier. (According to the system as
it stands, with each year, a girl has a decreasing chance
of getting into a smaller house—and no certainty that
at some time during her Stanford life she can live
where she chooses.)
The fact that you admit the unhappine.ss of many
girls "on the Row, in Union, and at Lag" seems to
indicate that something must be done to right the
situation. Perhaps Housing Committee has riot found
the solution—but denying the need for any solution
is not facing the facts.
In reference to "the other matter"—that of 'shrink

age': This quarter, a new system (publicized in The
Daily) of retaining numbers lor shrinkage as well as
for the regular drawing has already been put into
effect.
