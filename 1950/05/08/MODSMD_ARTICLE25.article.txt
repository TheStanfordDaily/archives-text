# Barbecue Thanks
## 
### 
To the Editor:
There were so many, many people who helped stage
and run the Cori Home Barbecue, that we are taking
this method of saying "Thank You" to them. From
the truck drivers, meat cutters, the AWS girls who
served, the fine performers in the Pavilion, to the
people who diJ the odd jobs associated with the affair,
the cheerful co-operation and efficient help were tops.
Stanford University has every right to be proud of
the job that was done Wednesday. We hope the satis
faction of a job well done is payment enough for those
who helped, because we could never repay them for
all they did.
