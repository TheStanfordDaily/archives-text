# Murphy Nips Cal Bearlets With One Hit
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
With Bob Murphy fashioning a
one - hit masterpiece, Stanford's
yearling baseballcrs knocked the
Cal frosh team into submission, JO
to 3, on the frosh diamond Saturday.
Except for the fifth inning Mur
phy was in complete control as he
struck out 11 en route to victory.
Stanford gave Murphy a 1 to 0
cushion in the first inning as Gone
Shirley walked, stole second, and
made the trip complete on powerful
Jim Agad's single to left.
Cal Catcher Errs
The Cardbabes found the plate
twice more in the fourth as Agar
got life on catcher Ray Greene's
error and came home on George
Zaninovich's deep hit to left. Za
ninovich later countered on the
ever-improving Gene Shirley's one
base blow to left.
Murphy lost his no-hitter and
shutout in the fifth as he ran into
temporary trouble. Two walks, two
players hit by pitched balls, a sin
gle. and an error sent three Cal
runs across the plate.
With the score now 3 all it was
still anybody's game, but Stanford's
not - to - be - denied frosh went to
work again. Catcher Jack Shepard,
the holier-man on the team, initi
ated the inning by driving a home
run over the left field boards. After
left fielder Berny Bernadou saw the
ball's flight, he didn't bother to give
chase to it, the homer was that cer
tain.
