# Crew Edged By UC Bears

Experience proved to be the best
teacher on the Oakland Estuary
Saturday, when California's sea
soned crews downed Stanford's
oarsmen in every one of the after
noon's five races. However, there
was more to Cal's impressive vic
tory than first glances would dis
close, for even in defeat the Indian
crewmen displayed a fighting
spirit which won the open admira
tion of every spectator.
Because of their impressive show
ing against the Olympic Games
champs, it is almost certain that
Stanford will be invited to the Na
tional Rowing Championships at
Marietta, Ohio, June 17.
