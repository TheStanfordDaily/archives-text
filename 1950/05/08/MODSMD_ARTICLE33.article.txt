# Netmen Blasted By Troy and COP
## 
### 
The Stanford tennis squad, unable
to match the experienced play of
two rivals, suffered a double set
back over the weekend. On Friday
the USC Trojans belted the Cards
on the home courts, 7-2. The COP
Tigers seemed ungracious hosts as
they easily blasted the Indians, 6-2,
Saturday.
Farm veteran Kirke Mechem
turned in the best single perform
ance of the weekend when he top
pled Tiger Hank Pfister, collegiate
champ of Northern California, in
three rugged sets, 4-6, 6-3, 10-8.
Against SC, Mechem held his pace
of the day before, but he was no
match for old pro Earl Cochell.
