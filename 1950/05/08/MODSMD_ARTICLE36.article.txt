# Varsity Nine Pounds Cal 7 to 6; Thriller Culminates Series Sweep
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's 1950 baseball team became the third in the school's history to sweep a California series
by downing the Bears, 7 to 6, in a nip-and-tuck battle in the Sunken Diamond Saturday afternoon.
The Indians had previously taken the Bears, 4 to 3 and 5 to 2, on the Berkeley campus this year.
In so doing, the Cards maintained their lead over the powerful USC nine, which picked up a half
a game on the loop-leading Indians by dumping St. Mary's twice by identical scores of 6 to 2 in the

Southland.
Capacity Crowd
The game, which had had a capac
ity crowd on the edge of its seats for
most of the afternoon, roared into a
dramatic ninth-inning conclusion
with the score tied at G up. Carl
Anaclerio, first man up for the Bears,
drew a base on balls and was sacri
ficed to second. However, Al Davies
Hied out to left field, and pinch-hitter
Ed Milano swung and missed a third
strike to end the Bears' half of the
inning.
Klein Triples
In Stanford's half of the inning,
lead-oft' man Bud Klein stepped into
Dave Anderson's first pitch and sent
it deep into the right field corner for
a triple. Anderson did the only thing
he could in intentionally walking
Dave Melton and Dick Clegg to load
the bags and set up the force-out at
home plate.
The Bear outfield moved in close
behind the infield as John Claypool
came to bat. Claypool popped the
first pitch foul over toward the Stan
ford dugout, and Cal Catcher Gil
Beck raced back to try to catch the
ball, but could not get to it.
Cal Coach CJint Evans showed the
tension that tne game was building
up by jumping out of the dugout and
hollering interference on the part of
Tom Shaw, who was standing next to
the bat rack, waiting his turn to bat.
However, umpire Kenny West ruled
that there had been no interference
as Shaw had moved out of the way
in plenty of time for Beck to get the
ball.
The Winning Run
Claypool fouled the next pitch up
into the stands, and then watched an
inside pitch go by for ball one. Clay
pool met Anderson's next delivery
and lined it by the grasping glove of
firstbaseman Ed Aitken. Right
fielder Syl McNinch picked up the
ball and fired home in a vain attempt
to get Klen as he crossed the plate
with the winning run.
It was an uphill fight for the Cards
as California built up an early 5 to 2
lead on starting hurler Jack Heinen.
Heinen was having all kinds of trou
ble with his control as he walked the
first three men to face him in the
opening frame. The Bears cashed-in
for two runs as Heinen hit Anaclerio
with a pitched ball and let go a wild
pitch.
Cal picked up another run in the
third on one hit as Heinen hit Don
Monroe with another pitched ball
and walked Don Dodson for the sec
ond time in as many innings.
Two More Runs
The Cards bounced back in their
half of the second to move within
one run of the Bears as they pushed
across a pair of tallies on doubles by
Shaw and Heinen and singles by
Bruce Cameron and Charlie Cole.
California stretched its lead again
in the third inning by chasing two
more runs across on consecutive
singles by Pete Corona and Al Da
vies and Monroe's booming triple up
on the bank in left centerfield.
After two were out in the fourth
frame, Heinen ran into control trou
ble again as he walked McNinch and

Anaclerio. That was enough for
Stanford Coach Everett Dean. He
signaled to the bull-pen, and brought
on his outstanding sophomore chuck
er 112 Joe Chez, who had been credited
with the two earlier wins over the
Bears.
Melton Snares Ball
Corona teed-off on Chez's first
pitch and sent it blazing back through
the box. The ball bounced off Chez's
glove and rolled behind him. Short
stop Dave Melton, circling behind
Chez, picked up the ball bare
handed and fired to first to nip Co
rona by half a stride in what was
easily the outstanding field play of
the day.
Cal's starting pitcher, Bill Gear,
ran into a streak of wildness in the
fifth inning as he walked Cole, Mel
ton, and Clegg, to load the bases with
two down. Clint Evans made one of
his frequent marches to the mound
with the fans helping him along by
counting cadence for him. After
talking things over, the Clinter de
cided to leave Gear in, and was re
warded by seeing him walk Claypool
on four pitches to force a run across,
(■ear Joins Ileinen
That was all for Gear as he was
sent to join Heinen in the showers,
while Dave Anderson came in to face
Shaw with the bases still loaded.
With the count one and one, Shaw
blasted a double down the third base
line to unload the bags to put the
Indians out in front, (5 to 5.
California tied it up in the ninth
when Anderson led off with a triple
and scored when Dick Clegg let Ait
ken's grounder down the first base
line to get through him. The run set
the stage for the climactic ninth in
ning.
Chez turned in a brilliant per
formance in his first appearance as
a reliefer. He allowed only three
hits and one unearned ruu in five
and a third innings and struck out
the third in three of the innings.
In Friday afternoon's game, the
Cards came from behind to take Col
lege of Pacific, 11 to 10, when they
scored the winning runs in the ninth
on a double squeeze play. With John
Claypool on third and Harry Hu
gasian on second, Dick Corzine
bunted down the first base line, and
both runners scored before the Ti
ger infield was able to get control of
the ball.
