# STANFORD 74, CALIFORNIA 57
## Freshman Cindermen Humble Calbabes In Little-Big Classic; Mathias Wins Five 
### HOWARD SEARS 
Bub Mathias el al. provided more
than intermission entertainment
Saturday afternoon when the frosh
tracksters climaxed the greatest
year in their history with the 74 to
57 shellacking of California's Cubs.
The issue was never in doubt
after the held events were posted
early in the meet. The Stanford's,
mostly Mathias, won every field
sport except in the broad jump.
Iron Man Hob
Mathias showed more iron than
any of them in a day of iron men
when he left the affair with the fol
lowing record: (1) He entered seven
events. (2) He won five of these
and finished second in another to
total 28 points. (3) He broke two
meet records, both of which had
stood for over 15 years.
It is impossible to praise Mathias
too highly. When the field events
were held he was competing in the
discus, high jump, pole vault, shot
put, and javelin simultaneously. He
won the discus with a record
breaking 152-ft. 10 :!, H-in. sail, the
pole vault at 12 ft. 6 in., and the
shot at 48 ft. s'h in., 2 1 •> inches off
the record. He finished second in
the high jump behind teammate
Norm Jiles, who leaped 6 ft. 2'/4 in.
Mathias stopped at six feet.
Bob on Foot
On foot. Big Bob loped over the
high hurdles with great ease, beat
ing Cal's Dick Clausen by 20 feet
and busting the record by two
tenths. Then he and Martin John
son ganged up to gvie Jim Plessas
a double beating in the low hurdles.
But Bob wasn't the only hero of
the affair. The aforementioned
Plessas contributed 16 points to his
California cause with firsts in both
sprints and the broad jump plus
third in the lows.
Bob Simon brought 8 points to
the Papoose score by winning the
mile from Cal's Herb Morrison in
4:26.9, and then copping second in
the half by losing out to Niel Mo
dosa of the Cubs, who ran a brisk
1:59.
