### BEV BOCK 
(Editor's Note.—This is the third
in a series of articles on women's
living areas designed to point out
their various advantages to women
who arc drawing for fall quarter
Wednesday.)
If you're looking for a home with
a fish pond, a darkroom, and are
afraid of earthquakes—then Lagunita
is the hall for you.
Earthquake-proof Lagunita Hall
spreads out over a large territory on
Santa Teresa street, northwest of
Quad. Its six casas opening onto a
spacious center court offer a combi
nation of large dorm living and small
groups.
Casas Adclfa. Euealypto, Granada,
Magnolia, Naranja, and Olivo house
at present 32(> women in singles and
doubles. The doubles are composed of
one room (known as a double single)
or two-room suites.
Dining Room Serves All
Each casa is separate, yet a part of
the whole dorm. All the girls cat in
the large dining room which is one
of the outstanding features of the
hall. All meals are served heic ex
cept late lunch, which is eaten at
Roble.
Lagunita's administrative officials
include a resident director, assistant
director, and four RA's. Each of
these women serves as an RA in one
casa.
Hall government is designed to co
ordinate the casas as well as to pro
vide for their individual activities.
Each casa has its own officers and
holds house meetings; representa
tives from the units serve on La
gunita Excom and committee of
seven.
Social Activities Vailed
Social activities of the hall include
all-hall dances and parties, as well
as frequent casa beach parties,
spreads, and other events. The large
dining hall and inner court are par
ticularly suited for dances.
Lagunita women pay $4 dues each
quarter. One dollar of this makes up
the room and board of a foreign stu
dent under the University Foreign
Scholarship Program. The casas take
turns each year housing this girl.
Each casa has a social room and
several small study rooms and li
braries. Four of the social rooms
open into the court and arc there
fore open to men. The court and ad
joining rooms are open to men until
the closing hours of the hall, and on
request men may enter to serenade
the girls after closing'.
Many Facilities Offered
Kitchenettes, laundry rooms, two
"holes," sunporches, ping-pong ta
bles, radio-phonograph combina
tions and three canoes at Lake Lag
are included in the facilities of the
hall. A volleyball court is one of the

j extras which has just been added,
i Each casa has its own record col
j lection, as well as an all-hall collec
tion of over 500 records.
Lag is a five-minute walk from the
j Post Office or the Geology corner of
Quad. For those who live on the east
I side of the dorm, there is a door at
the end of Olivo which saves those
girls the extra time of walking
around to the front door.
Junior Scholarship Financed
Lagunita's junior scholarship is a
well-established tradition. The
j money is raised by a junior class
during the year, then awarded to a
] member of that class in the spring
1 just before becoming a senior.
The scholarship committee sells
food—ice cream, sandwiches, or milk
j —one night each week. At the end of
May, graduating seniors each donate
j a piece of furniture which is auc
j tioned off to girls who will be in the
! hall the next year. The money col-
I lected from these two sources is used
for the scholarship, which was given
to two girls this year.
Lagunita seems to be a hall of
i paradoxes. The girl who wants quiet
i for studying can find it here; the
I coed who desires a spirited atmos
! pherc of fun and activity will also
find it in Lagunita. The woman who
I wants a large dorm, the woman look
| ing for a small living group—both
I will find the life they want in Lag's
1 dorm-casa system.
Colette Combs, hall president,
points out that Lag offers the best
advantages of both the dorm and unit
living. Many of its facilities, espe
cially the beautiful dining hall, would
; not be found in a smaller house; yet
most of the activities are carried on
within the smaller casa group.

Roble.
Lagunita's administrative officials
include a resident director, assistant
director, and four RA's. Each of
these women serves as an RA in one
casa.
Hall government is designed to co
ordinate the casas as well as to pro
vide for their individual activities.
Each casa has its own officers and
holds house meetings; representa
tives from the units serve on La
gunita Excom and committee of
seven.
Social Activities Vailed
Social activities of the hall include
all-hall dances and parties, as well
as frequent casa beach parties,
spreads, and other events. The large
dining hall and inner court are par
ticularly suited for dances.
Lagunita women pay $4 dues each
quarter. One dollar of this makes up
the room and board of a foreign stu
dent under the University Foreign
Scholarship Program. The casas take
turns each year housing this girl.
Each casa has a social room and
several small study rooms and li
braries. Four of the social rooms
open into the court and arc there
fore open to men. The court and ad
joining rooms are open to men until
the closing hours of the hall, and on
request men may enter to serenade
the girls after closing'.
Many Facilities Offered
Kitchenettes, laundry rooms, two
"holes," sunporches, ping-pong ta
bles, radio-phonograph combina
tions and three canoes at Lake Lag
are included in the facilities of the
hall. A volleyball court is one of the

j extras which has just been added,
i Each casa has its own record col
j lection, as well as an all-hall collec
tion of over 500 records.
Lag is a five-minute walk from the
j Post Office or the Geology corner of
Quad. For those who live on the east
I side of the dorm, there is a door at
the end of Olivo which saves those
girls the extra time of walking
around to the front door.
Junior Scholarship Financed
Lagunita's junior scholarship is a
well-established tradition. The
j money is raised by a junior class
during the year, then awarded to a
] member of that class in the spring
1 just before becoming a senior.
The scholarship committee sells
food—ice cream, sandwiches, or milk
j —one night each week. At the end of
May, graduating seniors each donate
j a piece of furniture which is auc
j tioned off to girls who will be in the
! hall the next year. The money col-
I lected from these two sources is used
for the scholarship, which was given
to two girls this year.
Lagunita seems to be a hall of
i paradoxes. The girl who wants quiet
i for studying can find it here; the
I coed who desires a spirited atmos
! pherc of fun and activity will also
find it in Lagunita. The woman who
I wants a large dorm, the woman look
| ing for a small living group—both
I will find the life they want in Lag's
1 dorm-casa system.
Colette Combs, hall president,
points out that Lag offers the best
advantages of both the dorm and unit
living. Many of its facilities, espe
cially the beautiful dining hall, would
; not be found in a smaller house; yet
most of the activities are carried on
within the smaller casa group.
