# Moot Court Hears Case On Rights
## 
### 
A case affecting the rights of an
escaped convict will be argued to
night in the second meeting of the
preliminary rounds of the 1950 Moot
Court competition at 8:15 in the
Moot Court room of the Law School.
Upholding the rights of the pris
oner as appellant in tonight's pub
lic hearing will be John MeElrath
and Bob Bennett. The case for the
respondents will be argued by W.
H. McPherson and Bruce Mitchell.
The convicted murderer in ques
tion had been placed on the infa
mous chain gang in the state of
Georgia. He escaped to the state of
Stanford, and the Governor of
Georgia requested extradition of the
escaped criminal.
Extradition
Extradition was ordered by the
Governor of Stanford, and the pris
oner was placed in custody in the
state of Stanford to await proceed
ings to remove him to Georgia.
The prisoner petitioned for a writ
of habeas corpus, claiming that he
was subjected to cruel and unusual
punishment in Georgia in violation
of the 14th amendment to the Fed
eral Constittuion, and was therefore
entitled to be released from custody
in Stanford.
Claiming that the punishment was
not cruel and unusual, the state of
Georgia intervened. Even if it was,
they said, it did not entitle the pris
oner to be released from custody.
