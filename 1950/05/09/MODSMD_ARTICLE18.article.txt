First Conference
"This is the first student leader
ship conference to be held at Stan- j
ford," said Kay Wold, Excom mem- J
ber and member of the conference
planning committee. "They have !
worked out well at other schools,
and we'd like to have them every ;
year."
Rex Johnson, another committer
member, gave one reason for the j
meet: when student officers take j
over their duties there is often a j
lack of understanding of their ex
act relationship to student govern- j
ment and to the administration.
"This conference should !i r, lp to
alleviate that situation," he said.
People who expect to attend the j
conference and participate in panel j
discussions should sign at the ASSU j
office in the Union, or during regis- |
tration Friday at 2 p.m. in the Edu- j
cation Building, said Johnson.
Some of the panel discussion top- !
ics are: interrelation of student or- j
ganizations, Honor Code and Fun- ;
damental Standard, Stanford spirit, j
and new areas for student activities.
