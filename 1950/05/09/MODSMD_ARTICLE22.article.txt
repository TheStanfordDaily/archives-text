# Acheson OK's Immediate U.S. Aid to Indochina
## 
### 
PARIS, May 8 (AP) —Secretary of State Dean Acheson an
nounced tonight that immediate American financial aid and mili
tary equipment will be thrown into the shooting war in Indochina.
At the same time authoritative sources said he had won French
assent to putting Western Germans in charge of their own foreign

policy for the first time since the war.'
These developments came from
day-long conferences among the
American Secretary of State and
French Foreign Minister Robert
Schurnan and their aides. They were
the first fruits of conferences, ex
pected to continue here and in Lon
don for at least 10 days, with minis
ters of Atlantic Pact nations on
I tightening (he cold war front against
[ Communism.
Authoritative informants said
| Schurnan and Achcson had agreed,
! subject to British Foreign Secretary
■ Ernest Bevin's accord, on revisions
jof the German occupation statute
j which would give the Bonn republic
virtually complete leeway in its po
litical and economic affairs.
Qualified sources said American
aid in Indochina, where guerrilla
war with Moscow-backed Ho Chi
Minh has been stalemated more than
four years, would be immediate.
The bulk of $75,000,000 already ap
propriated by Congress to combat
Communism in the Far East will go
to the French-backed Vietnamese of
ex-Emperor Bao Dai and the asso
ciated states of Cambodia and Laos,
il was explained. The appropriation
expires in .June. Originally Indo
china was due to get only $15,000,000
from the fund.
Arms and other military aid, it was
said by an authoritative American
source, will be shipped directly to
Indochina—none of it will be chan
neled through France. Furthermore,
little of the aid will be economic.
