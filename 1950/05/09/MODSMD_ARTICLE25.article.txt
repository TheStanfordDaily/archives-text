# Library Official Estimates Cost Of Sunday Tours
## 
### 
Eastori Rothwell, vice-chairman <>112
the Hoover Institute and Library,
yesterday estimated that it would
cost up to $50 to keep the library open
to visitors on Sunday.
Rothwell said that his estimate was
much closer to the probable cost than
The Daily's $15 figure, since mature
and responsible persons would have
to be hired to conduct the visitors to
the top of the tower and safeguard
the collections in the library.
Touts through the library on the
lix weekdays are conducted I y the
library staff and supported by the
library budget. Rothwell said, how
ever, that the library could not afford
the extra expense of Sunday tours.
He suggested that the matter be
brought up with the University
President's office for further con
sideration.
Rothwell said approximately 50,
000 visitors saw the Stanford cam
pus from the top of the tower last
year.
