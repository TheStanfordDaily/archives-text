# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
A great philosopher once said that among things
most often opened by mistake is the mouth.
I hesitate to tell you, but yesterday 1 discovered how
true this could really be. However, just as Pythagoras
told me, "Censure yourself lor base acts, rejoice in the

goodly," I relate the following in
cident.
Con Home Week had finally
come to an end, but it had left me
with a feeling of doing unto others
us I would have them do unto me,
and I had decided to put in a plug
for Bill Dailey's Spring Show,
when actually, the only plug
Dailey is worth is from a loaded
revolver.
Nevertheless, I was on my v/ay
into The Daily Shack to type out

a note saying that the Spring Show, scheduled for
May 18, 19, and 20, will probably be the greatest of all
time, that the admission prices are as low as Seattle's
baseball team (see sports), and that everybody who is
anybody always goes to the Spring Show.
I fill you in on this background data because the
story needs it like USC needs money.
At any rate, I walked into The Daily Shack, sing
ing a short excerpt from the "Sweetheart of Sigma
Chi," smiled at the editor, and then froze.
His office was filled with sophomore trackmen who
were frothing at the mouth, tearing phone books in
half, and doing other little odd things to tip off their
obvious state of mind,
"There he is now," one of them shouted.
Suddenly, two hands seized my right arm, two got
my left arm, and five or six got my throat. "Dibs on

his head, I want to practice the shot put," muttered
one of the bigger members of the goon squad.
"Save his tongue for me," yelled another. "I got a
bio lab."
"Wait a minute," said a kinder voice. "Give him a
chance to explain. The stupid idiot!"
"But-but, boys," I stammered weakly. "Surely,
things can't be this bad."
"Shut-up," said a dash man.
"I don't think you see the point," said a javelin
thrower, as he jabbed his spear into my stomach.
"What's the idea saying yesterday that the 1950 frosh
was the first to beat Cal since 1612?" asked the kinder
voice.
Not prepared for such a straightforward question, 1
stammered again, and then muttered weakly, "It was
just a gag. No kidding, just a gag."
"We oughta gag you," said the shotputter.
"You know, or maybe you don't, you bum, that
Stanford Frosh just last year, 1949 to be exact, waxed
the Cal Frosh, to 60'and that isn't very far
back."
Oh yeah, Mathias is 19, not 18, but chalk that one up
I can do."
"You can't do nothing," said the dash man.
Then they began to pass me around like a baton,
except that they would drop me every few minutes,
and I realized that the mouth is a nice thing when kept
closed, and vowed to do careful checking before crack
ing it again.
Oh yeah, Mathas s 19, not 18, but chalk that one up
to the linotypist. He's human, too.
Now,,we all can rejoice in the goodly. And don't
forget the Spring Show â€”see you at Engineering Cor-
