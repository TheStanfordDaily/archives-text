# Quads to Arrive Here on June 7
## 
### 
The Stanford Quad will come out
June 7.
That is the date on which the staff
of the yearbook will start to dis
tribute the volumes. Those with
names on the cover will be distrib
uted first. Details on this distribu
tion will be announced later in the
Daily.
Quads may still be ordered, al
though four-fifths of the printing
has already been sold. They will be
on sale tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 3
p.m. in front of the Cellar. Price of
the Quad is $6.50.
