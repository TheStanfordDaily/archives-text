# Union Unit Is Right In The Middle of Things
## 
### BEVERLY BOCK 
(Editor's note: This is the
fourth in a series of features on
women's housing.)
Right in the middle of things—
that's Union Residence.
And not far away are six other
houses which, together with the
dormitory, form Union Unit.
Union Unit's dormitory and small
houses are knit together under a
central government to which each
member sends representatives. Also
there are individual governments in
the dormitory and in each of the
houses.
The activities of the women are
carried out on this same principle
of the Unit as a whole and the
houses as individuals. Each girl
pays $5 dues a quarter, which helps
pay for the room, board, and ex
pense money of a foreign scholar
ship student.
The women are further brought
together by sharing the large dining
hall in Union Residence, since the
houses have no cooking facilities.
Union Residence
Just a 20-second walk from the
Cellar, ivy-colored Union Residence
affords a view of Union Court in
front and the Corp Yard in back.
Its good-sized rooms house 77 wom
en in doubles and singles.
Since breakfast and lunch are
served cafeteria style, many of the

girls eat lunch on sunny days in the
small patio. A ping pong table, a
volleyball court, a sun porch, an
automatic washer, and four drying
rooms add to the convenience and
pleasantness of the hall.
In summing up the advantages of
living in Union Residence, Jo Ann
Schaaf, hall president, mentions
that the hall is large enough so that
participation in activities is not
required of everyone, yet small
enough so that anyone who wants
may be included. Central location
and attractiveness are other fea
tures which make lile at Union en
joyable.
Union Units
The six Union units are diverse in
nature and size.
Ranged u!ong Salvatierra are Ma
drono, which houses about 37 girls;
Elm, 12; and Mariposa, 25. Manza
nita, wtih 15 girls, is on the Row
next to Lathrop House. Near the
Bookstore is Casa Espanola with 15
girls, and across lrom the firehouse
is Maison Franrjaise, former Oaks
Residence, housing 16 women.
Students interested in living at
either the Spanish or the French
house may apply at the Romanic
Languages Department.
The general management of these
houses is the same. Each has an RA
and its own house officers. All the
girls in each house take turns doing
phone duty, except Friday and Sat
urday night, and lock -up duty.
Since there are no night assistants,
the women have their own keys
which must be returned when they
come in at night.
Unlike the Row houses, residents
of Union units are not required to
attend all social functions of the
house.
The sizes of the rooms and the
facilities offered vary with each
house. Manzanita has a Bendix
which all may use, and most of the
houses have sun porches, laundry
facilities, and social rooms.
The arrangement of living in a
small house and participating in ac
tivities with a small group and yet
eating with a large number of wom
en and entering activities with them
also is a unique feature of the Union
units. These houses offer the ad
vantages of small - group living
without so much of the added re
sponsibility which Row houses de
mand.

girls eat lunch on sunny days in the
small patio. A ping pong table, a
volleyball court, a sun porch, an
automatic washer, and four drying
rooms add to the convenience and
pleasantness of the hall.
In summing up the advantages of
living in Union Residence, Jo Ann
Schaaf, hall president, mentions
that the hall is large enough so that
participation in activities is not
required of everyone, yet small
enough so that anyone who wants
may be included. Central location
and attractiveness are other fea
tures which make lile at Union en
joyable.
Union Units
The six Union units are diverse in
nature and size.
Ranged u!ong Salvatierra are Ma
drono, which houses about 37 girls;
Elm, 12; and Mariposa, 25. Manza
nita, wtih 15 girls, is on the Row
next to Lathrop House. Near the
Bookstore is Casa Espanola with 15
girls, and across lrom the firehouse
is Maison Franrjaise, former Oaks
Residence, housing 16 women.
Students interested in living at
either the Spanish or the French
house may apply at the Romanic
Languages Department.
The general management of these
houses is the same. Each has an RA
and its own house officers. All the
girls in each house take turns doing
phone duty, except Friday and Sat
urday night, and lock -up duty.
Since there are no night assistants,
the women have their own keys
which must be returned when they
come in at night.
Unlike the Row houses, residents
of Union units are not required to
attend all social functions of the
house.
The sizes of the rooms and the
facilities offered vary with each
house. Manzanita has a Bendix
which all may use, and most of the
houses have sun porches, laundry
facilities, and social rooms.
The arrangement of living in a
small house and participating in ac
tivities with a small group and yet
eating with a large number of wom
en and entering activities with them
also is a unique feature of the Union
units. These houses offer the ad
vantages of small - group living
without so much of the added re
sponsibility which Row houses de
mand.
(Editor's note: This is the
fourth in a series of features on
women's housing.)
Right in the middle of things—
that's Union Residence.
And not far away are six other
houses which, together with the
dormitory, form Union Unit.
Union Unit's dormitory and small
houses are knit together under a
central government to which each
member sends representatives. Also
there are individual governments in
the dormitory and in each of the
houses.
The activities of the women are
carried out on this same principle
of the Unit as a whole and the
houses as individuals. Each girl
pays $5 dues a quarter, which helps
pay for the room, board, and ex
pense money of a foreign scholar
ship student.
The women are further brought
together by sharing the large dining
hall in Union Residence, since the
houses have no cooking facilities.
Union Residence
Just a 20-second walk from the
Cellar, ivy-colored Union Residence
affords a view of Union Court in
front and the Corp Yard in back.
Its good-sized rooms house 77 wom
en in doubles and singles.
Since breakfast and lunch are
served cafeteria style, many of the

girls eat lunch on sunny days in the
small patio. A ping pong table, a
volleyball court, a sun porch, an
automatic washer, and four drying
rooms add to the convenience and
pleasantness of the hall.
