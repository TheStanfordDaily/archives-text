# SUNKEN DIAMOND GAME TODAY
## Card Nine Hosts Broncs In Final Game of Series 
### BILL SWIGART 
The Santa Clara Broncos, operat
ing behind their smooth left-hander
Hal Toso, will attempt to take a
spoilers' role this afternoon as they
invade Stanford's spacious Sunken
Diamond for their third and final
game of the year with Coach Ever
ett Dean's league - leading varsity
base bailers.
It will be a case of the Broncs,
already eliminated as a pennant
threat, trying to salvage a little
glory out of the current campaign
by taking the odd game in their
series with the Indians.
Stanford, on the other hand, must
win today to stay in the driver's
seat in the race for that often-men
tioned "first pennant since '31."

Game time will be the usual
weekday 3:15.
Stanford won the first game of
the season, 4 to 3, behind the timely
relief pitching of "Cowboy" Dave
Stolt, but bowed to the Toso jinx
the next time, 4 to 2.
Ilcinen on Mound
This afternoon, the Indains will
send "Jake" Heinen, the strong
armed right-hander, to the hill in
an effort to shut off the "Toso men
ace." The Cards have always been
notoriously weak against the lefties,
but Toso they have never beaten.
Big question of the afternoon will
be whether Heinen can come back
strong today after a shaky starting
job against the California Bears
only last Saturday. Big Jake lasted
only three and two-thirds innings
against the Bears, but was wild and
threw a lot of balls while he was
in there.
If Heinen's arm isn't up to snuff
then Dean will have his problems
finding somebody who is ready to
pitch. Joe Chez, the league's top
money winner, finished the last five
innings Saturday and probably isn't
ready yet, while Jim Claypool, the
number three starter, pitched nine
innings of shaky ball against COP
on Friday. Dave Stott, the league's
best fireman, hasn't been able to go
more than four or five innings at a
time this season.
USC Series Next
Big noise in the Santa Clara line
up of late has been Bob Nard, the
little second baseman. Nard leads
the Bronc hitting with a .349 per
centage, was first up to last week
end in total number of hits in the
CIBA and also in total number of
runs scored. Teammate Joe Nally
led the conference with 15 runs bat
ted in and three home runs in
games played up through last
Thursday.
Today's game won't make or
break tfte Cards as far as the pen
nant race goes, but a victory over
the Broncs could take a lot of pres

sure off of them when they face
USC in a two-game series down in
Los Angeles this weekend.
