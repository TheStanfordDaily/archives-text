# Padres Top PCL; Hollywood Follows
## 
### JOHN HALL 
San Diego's PCL pace - setters,
still two games to the good after
six weeks of wear, should reduce
the other seven teams to rabble this
week as they go after Emil Sick's
Seattle Rainiers, the losingest team
in Pacific Coast annals.
Sick, who has been sobbing into
his beer since San Diego dumped
the Suds seven straight times two
weeks ago, saw his boys win their
first series last week (over Sacra
mento, 5-2), but he still can't get
over the fact that his club is being
used as the subject for riddles up
and down the coast â€”"It has 18 legs,
catches flies, and lives in the cellar.
What is it?"

The only two teams that could
possibly catch the flying Padres this
week, Los Angeles and Hollywood,
are scheduled for the same ball
park, and in the end will probably
only succeed in chipping each other
off the pace.
The Angels, however, appear to
be the warmest club in the loop.
With centerfielder Frankie Baum
ho!tz and first sacker Elbie Fletcher
massaging the ball at a .400 clip,
Los Angeles has walked off with
three straight series against San
Diego, Hollywood, and San Fran
cisco.
Starting the week in third place,
the Seals were moved out by Los
Angeles, and will have to pull
themselves together this week
against Oakland if they are to re
main in the first division.
Oakland, which grabbed a 4-3 nod
from Hollywood, will invade Seals
Stadium with blood in its eye (and
a little in its nose from two whip
pings Sunday), looking for revenge
over the Seals who subdued them
two weeks ago.
O'Dull is scheduled to throw A 1
Lien tonight against Oakland's
George Bamburger. Lien, with six
wins against no defeats, represents
the best that Lefty has to offer. Af
er that, look out.
