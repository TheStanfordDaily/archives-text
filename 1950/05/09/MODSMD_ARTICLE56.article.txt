# ATO Nine, Bradshaws, Win 9 to 0
## 
### 
Two classy shutouts featured the
mural softball games yesterday.
ATO routed Sigma Nu 9 to 0, and
Sigiria Chi walloped the Zetes 12
to 0.
The battlin' Bradshaw brothers
led ATO to its victory. Jack pitched
the first six innings, allowing only
one hit. Dick, who had been catch
ing, came in to hurl the last frame
and struck out the three men who
faced him. Baby brother Dwight
finished the act by batting in two
runs with a long double in the
third inning.
ATO started slowly, scoring only
one run in their first two times at
bat; but they finished with a five
run barrage in the third, and added
three more in the fourth.
Ken LaCrosse fashioned his third
shutout of the season and his first
no-hitter in pitching his Sigma Chi
mates to their fourth straight tri
umph. Only one Zete got as far as
second base, in this masterpiece of
the mound.
Bill Dailey started the Sigma Chi
offensive atack with a homer in the
top of the first. Thereafter everyone
on the team chimed in, Bartow Fite
the loudest with two booming home
runs and a single, and it was Sigma
Chi all the way.
