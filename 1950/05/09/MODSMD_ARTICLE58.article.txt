# SC Mermen Dunk Cards 50 to 25
## 
### 
Although they split a pair with
their southern foes this weekend,
Stanford's swimmers are disap
pointed over their poor showing in
the USC meet Saturday, which they
lost 50 to 25.
Wins in both relays and a double
win by Waliy Wolf in the distance
races, plus a sweep in the diving,
gave the Trojans enough points to
make it a waxing.
Wolf, Pete Cole, and Ralph Sala
hooked up twice in the feature
races of the day. The Olympic team
member from Beverly Hills beat
Sala and Cole in the 220 and again
in the 440. Sala, who was fourth in
the 220 and first in the quarter in
the NCAA meet, was in no condi
tion for the meet, as he has been
busy making up his grades to be
come eligible.
The only winner for the Cardi
nals was Ernie Polte, blond Boat
house lifeguard, who won the 200-
yard breaststroke over SC's school
record-holder, Jim Ross.
The afternoon before the USC
meet, the Indians beat the feeble
UCLA squad 53 to 22.
Saturday morning, vr TTie last
home swimming meet, the Indian
frosh beat Monterey Peninsula Col
lege, 45 to 30.
Mel Smith scored first places for
the frosh in the 50- and 100-yard
events, and Don Kauffman did like
wise in the 220 and 440.
