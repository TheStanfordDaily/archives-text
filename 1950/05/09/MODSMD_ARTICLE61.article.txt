# Stanford Aids Men to Sight
## 
### 
Three men and a high-school boy
got partially new eyes in opera
tions at Stanford University Hospi
tal over the weekend, Miss Barbara
Parke, secretary of the Stanford
Eye Bank, announced yesterday.
Corneal transplants gave good
chance of near normal eyesight to a
San Jose business man, 53, who has
faced increasing blindness since
childhood; to a resident of Ogden,
Utah, now 69, who is promised a job
when he can see; to a spot welder
in Oakland; and a Bay Area student
of 16.
Names of the patients and of the
eye specialist who performed the |
series of delicate operations were j
withheld. Some of the expense was
met by the eye bank, and in the
case of the student bv the State
Services for Cripp'ed Children.
The announcement said the San
Jose business man was given the
eye donated before death by Mrs.
Magdalena Seheller, 82, of Camp
bell, whose sight was so good she
did close needlework shortly before
her death.
Another donor was William
Meinhardt of San Francisco. He and !
his wife both willed their eyes to
the bank prior to his death recently t
from a heart attack.
