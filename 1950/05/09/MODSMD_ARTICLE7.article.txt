# Labor Unity Question
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA The AFL said
again today it is willing to meet
with the CIO and draw up plans for
permanent* merger of both organiza
tions.
But President William Green of
the AFL made it clear in a letter to
President Philip Murray of the CIO
that unity must be on "a permanent
and organic basis" and "not merely
upon a tentative and co-operative
basis."
