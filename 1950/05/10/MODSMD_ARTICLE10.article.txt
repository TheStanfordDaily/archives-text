be turned in by 4 p.m. tomorrow to
Row Excom in the lower lounge of
the Women's Clubhouse. The elec

The Row president must be a jun

rience as a council representative in
a women's living unit for at least one
quarter.
The candidates will come around to
the Row houses tomorrow night, Fri
day noon, and Monday noon. Candi

night at 6 and will go to Jordan, Du
rand, and Roth during dinner.
