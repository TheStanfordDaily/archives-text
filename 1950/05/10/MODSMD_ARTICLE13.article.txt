## Convict's Case Is Moot Issue 
### 
Marilyn Green, William Willens,
Clyde Small, and Jerry Harland
continue Moot Court arguments to
night in competition for semi-final
round positions at 8:15 in the Moot
Court room of the Law School.
The four will consider the same
case that was argued last night con
cerning the convicted murderer who
escaped from a Georgia chain gang
to the imaginary stale of Stanford.
Miss Green and Willens will be
the appellants at the public mock
trial. Respondents in the hypotheti
cal case will be Small and Harland.
Presiding as judges at the court
will be Robert Zang, instructor in
the Law School; Bernard Landman,
third-year law student; and Elton
F. Martin, also a third-year law
student. Clerk of the court will be
Lewis Fcnton.
In the case under consideration,
the escaped prisoner was placed in
custody in the state of Stanford
awaiting extradition to Georgia
when he petitioned for a writ of
habeas corpus.
The convict claimed that he was
subjected to cruel and unusual pun
ishment it) the infamous chain gang
in violation of the 14th amendment,
and was therefore entitled to be re
leased from custody.
The state of Georgia claims that
lie should not be released because
the punishment was not cruel and
unusual, and even if it were, it did
not entitle the prisoner to be re
leased from custody.
Preliminary rounds of the Stan
ford Moot, Court of Appeals take
place every night this week begin
ning at 8:15 in the Moot Court in
the Law School. They arc all open
to the public.
