## 
### ANN NORTON 
(Editor's Note.—This is (he see- i
ond in a series of articles on far- j
ulty members who arc new to the j
students or who arc engaged in
particularly interesting fields.)

A young man with a soft voice
picked up a square piece of
cardboard with many violently
colored criss - crossed lines
painted on it. It looked like a
picture of scattered jack-straws.
"Chaos," he said. Then he
picked up a similar piece of
cardboard with tepidly colored
parallel lines painted on it.
"This means 'peace'," he ex
plained.
This man is M'atl Kahn, a com
parative newcomer to the Stanford
Art Department, who (caches a new
language of colors and shapes which
express emotion, attitudes, and philo
sophical concepts in the abstract.
His work is subjective, for he ex
presses his own thoughts and emo
tions. His inspirations arc human and
express human ideas. However, lie
does not cater to an audience if that
audience has ideas conflicting with
hi.s own.
Paints and Designs
The 21-year-old artist paints, de
signs wallpaper, and makes jewelry
and furniture. He is a recent gradu
ate of the Cran brook Academy of
Art in Michigan and is a holder of
the coveted Spadca Award. His
work is currently on display in San
■lose.
His wife, Lyda Kahn, an artist also,
is for the most part a weaver. She
learned to weave from her mother in
Palestine, and there had to depend
on primitive machines and materials.
Fn this country with the many new
fabrics and substances at her dis
posal, her weaving has become a
fusion of the earthy influences of
living and working in Palestine, and
the more sophisticated elements of
materials she found here.
Projcct Consideration
When Kahn decides to begin on a
project he first carefully considers
its ultimate use. Then lie must think

of the means of construction and he
aware of tin- economic factors of pro
duction.
These considerations all ndect the
ultimate plan of the work. Otherwise
he lets his imagination go and pro
duces (lie subjective, unique factor in
the article which makes it a "Kahn."
Matt Kahn represents the most
modern of the modern. Hs art is the

brunl (if jokes and the objcct of
praise depending on who is doiny the
talking. All he asks is understand
ing before judgment.
"If people can honestly say they
know paint, or stone, or wood, what
can be done with them and what
cannot," said Kahn, "then let them
say 'I like,' or 'I don't like' what Malt
Kahn is saying'."
