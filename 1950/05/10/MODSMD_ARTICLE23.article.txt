OAKLAND, May 9 (AP) —A woman ex-Communist testified to
day that Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer once held a closed Communist
meeting at his home in Berkeley—testimony flatly denied tonight
in Washington by the top atomic scientist.
The witness, Mrs. Sylvia Crouch, appeared before the State

' Senate un-American Activities Com-
I mittee which is seeking to determine
if there were Communists connected
with the University of California'.,
atom-smashing laboratory.
Mrs. Crouch, an admitted Commu
nist from 1929 to until 1942, said she
attended the meeting in 1941 and that
photographs of Dr. Oppenheimer
which she saw later convinced her he
was one of those present.
In Washington, Dr. Oppenheimer
said in a statement tonight he never
had been a Communist Party mem
ber, never attended a party meeting
] "in my home or anywhere else."
He said he formerly knew many
persons in "left-wing circles" and
had belonged to several left-wing
organizations but that the govern
ment knew about that ever since he
started work on the atomic bomb
project.
Dr. Oppenheimer, chairman of t lie
powerful advisory committee which
shapes policy for the nation's Atomic
Energy Commission, was a director
of the Atomic Research Laboratory
a* Los Alamos, N.M., during the war/
The first atom bombs were built
there.
At Princeton, N.J., where the sci
entist now directs the Institute for
Advanced Studies, his office reported
he was out of the city and could not,
be reached immediately for comment.
Mrs. Crouch, whose husband, Paul,
has testified for the government at
numerous anti-Communist trials and
hearings, said she picked out Dr. Op
penheimer from a group of pictures
shown her by government agents.
She recognized his picture, she
said, as that of a man she had seen
; for the first time at the Communist,
meeting on the Berkeley campus
She also picked out the picture <>112
Joseph Weinberg as another of the
; group of some 25 to 30 persons at the
gathering.
Mrs. Crouch said she had seen Dr.
; Oppenheimer several times after the
Berkeley meeting, but never again
at a closed Communist session.
The testimony caused an imme
diate stir in scientific circles, wherr*
Dr. Oppenheimer's standing is very
high. His name never before ha,
been publicly connected with possi
ble Communist Party membership,
although his brother Dr. Frank Op
penheimer, admitted being a party
member.

OAKLAND, May 9 (AP) —A woman ex-Communist testified to
day that Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer once held a closed Communist
meeting at his home in Berkeley—testimony flatly denied tonight
in Washington by the top atomic scientist.
The witness, Mrs. Sylvia Crouch, appeared before the State

' Senate un-American Activities Com-
I mittee which is seeking to determine
if there were Communists connected
with the University of California'.,
atom-smashing laboratory.
Mrs. Crouch, an admitted Commu
nist from 1929 to until 1942, said she
attended the meeting in 1941 and that
photographs of Dr. Oppenheimer
which she saw later convinced her he
was one of those present.
In Washington, Dr. Oppenheimer
said in a statement tonight he never
had been a Communist Party mem
ber, never attended a party meeting
] "in my home or anywhere else."
He said he formerly knew many
persons in "left-wing circles" and
had belonged to several left-wing
organizations but that the govern
ment knew about that ever since he
started work on the atomic bomb
project.
Dr. Oppenheimer, chairman of t lie
powerful advisory committee which
shapes policy for the nation's Atomic
Energy Commission, was a director
of the Atomic Research Laboratory
a* Los Alamos, N.M., during the war/
The first atom bombs were built
there.
At Princeton, N.J., where the sci
entist now directs the Institute for
Advanced Studies, his office reported
he was out of the city and could not,
be reached immediately for comment.
Mrs. Crouch, whose husband, Paul,
has testified for the government at
numerous anti-Communist trials and
hearings, said she picked out Dr. Op
penheimer from a group of pictures
shown her by government agents.
She recognized his picture, she
said, as that of a man she had seen
; for the first time at the Communist,
