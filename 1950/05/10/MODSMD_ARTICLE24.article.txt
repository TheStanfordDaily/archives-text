# LD Women Draw Today For Rooms
## 
### 
Fall quarter residence draw
ing for women who will be
lower division next year will be
held today in the lower lounge
of the Women's Clubhouse
from 8:15 a.m. to 2:15 p.m.
Any woman with a total of fewer
than 85 units at the end of spring
quarter is eligible to draw today.
RobJe freshmen are required to draw,
but others may stay in their pres
ent residences.
Women who will have 85 or more
units may draw Monday. Placements
will be made after the drawings are
completed.
Those participating in either draw
ing will follow the same procedure.
A number must be drawn during the
designated hours and a residence
choice card filled out. The card is to
contain at least 10 choices and may
be obtained at the residences or at
the clubhouse.
Cancellations
Completing these steps releases a
woman from her present residence
assignment unless she cancels her
number. All cancellations will be
accepted after Monday's drawing un
til a date to be announced. No lower
division students may cancel before
this date, and Roble residents may
not withdraw from the drawing.
Women may draw in pairs. This
will assure their being placed in the
same house, but may prevent their
being placed in the same house, but
may prevent their getting into a
residence of their choice if there are
not. two vacancies left.
Placement will be made on the
basis of number drawn and class
status. Mary Skillen, chairman of
AWS Housing Committee, empha
sizes that the proposals before AWS
for changing the placement system
have been tabled until after the
drawing. Any change decided on will
affect next year's drawing, hut this
year's will follow the old procedure.
Ratio To Be Set
After all women have drawn, a
ratio will be set up among the classes
corresponding to the number of
women in each class who draw. Va
cancies in each residence will then
be alloted to the classes by this ra
tio.
Thus, if 300 women draw, they are
then counted by classes. Suppose
there are 210 who will be sophomores
next year, HO who will be juniors,
and .50 seniors-to-be. This gives a
ratio of 7-2-1 which will be applied
to the vacancies in each living group.
If a house has 10 vacancies, 7 will go
to next year's sophomores, 2 to jun
iors, and 1 to seniors.
Mary also points out that there will
be vacancies in all living groups next
fall. Therefore, it will be very help
ful to housing committee if women
will put down at least 10 choices on
their cards. This will facilitate place
ment, since women must be con
tacted if all their choices are taken
when their numbers come up.
A tentative list of vacancies in all
the houses will be printed in The
Daily next week before cancellations
are due.

Fall quarter residence draw
ing for women who will be

Any woman with a total of fewer
than 85 units at the end of spring

RobJe freshmen are required to draw,
but others may stay in their pres
ent residences.
Women who will have 85 or more

completed.
Those participating in either draw
ing will follow the same procedure.
A number must be drawn during the
designated hours and a residence
choice card filled out. The card is to
contain at least 10 choices and may

Cancellations

woman from her present residence
assignment unless she cancels her
number. All cancellations will be
accepted after Monday's drawing un
til a date to be announced. No lower
division students may cancel before
this date, and Roble residents may
not withdraw from the drawing.
Women may draw in pairs. This
will assure their being placed in the
same house, but may prevent their
being placed in the same house, but
may prevent their getting into a
residence of their choice if there are
not. two vacancies left.
Placement will be made on the
basis of number drawn and class
status. Mary Skillen, chairman of
AWS Housing Committee, empha
sizes that the proposals before AWS
for changing the placement system
have been tabled until after the
drawing. Any change decided on will
affect next year's drawing, hut this
year's will follow the old procedure.
Ratio To Be Set
After all women have drawn, a
ratio will be set up among the classes
corresponding to the number of
women in each class who draw. Va
cancies in each residence will then
be alloted to the classes by this ra
tio.
Thus, if 300 women draw, they are
then counted by classes. Suppose
there are 210 who will be sophomores
next year, HO who will be juniors,
and .50 seniors-to-be. This gives a
ratio of 7-2-1 which will be applied
to the vacancies in each living group.
If a house has 10 vacancies, 7 will go
to next year's sophomores, 2 to jun
iors, and 1 to seniors.
Mary also points out that there will
be vacancies in all living groups next
fall. Therefore, it will be very help
ful to housing committee if women
will put down at least 10 choices on
their cards. This will facilitate place
ment, since women must be con
tacted if all their choices are taken
when their numbers come up.
