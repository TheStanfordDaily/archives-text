## A 						Spring Night's Dream 
### 
Last week, I had one of those rare occasions when I
was able to complete all my homework while ihe eve
ning was still young. I decided to retire arid peruse
'ihe Works of Mencius, which is one of my favorite
bedside books. After some little time, I fell asleep and
experienced a most extraordinary dream.
I dreamt I was in a musty old room with an antique
bed in the center. Upon the Led lay an old man who
had experience and irony written upon his face. Al
though he was dying, there was still a sparkle in his
eyes. His eyes were naturally lustrous, but his sallow
complexion made them unnaturally so. lie beckoned
me to his bedside and said:
"Never lose your temper at bridge. Never indulge in
slicing when playing golf. Never bet on a sure thing.
Never lose your dignity though you lose your shirt.
Never drink champagne when you can get beer. Never
drink cocktails. Never get drunk on wine. Never
drink coffee with sugar. Never drink coffee with
cream. Never drink coffee.
"Never run short of cigarettes. Never smoke a pipe
until you've reached middle age. Never colli ct stamps.
Never be in possession small change when y<;u go out
with a rich man. Never borrow."
The old man paused for a moment. His eyes roved
slowly around the room, and a faint smile played on

his lips. He continued:
"Never collect press-cuttings. Never write letters
to editors without thinking twice. Never forget that
it is much easier to allow an existing evil to remain
than to try to correct it. Never forget to take English
professors seriously. Never split an infinitive. Never
i'orget that in spite of all that has been said, a frank
person is seldom appreciated.
"Never forget that most men are stupid, and those
who are not stupid are usually conceited. Never forget
when discussing anything with authorities that they
probably know even less about the matter than you do.
Never talk when you can listen. Never listen when
you can read. Never read without meditation. Never
explain.
Never forget to assure a woman that she is unlike
any other woman in the world. Never argue with a
woman. Never complain of illnesses in front of so
ciety women. Never relate oft-color jokes in mixed
company. Never despise a reputation for wit. Never.
At this point I was brought back to the world of
reality by the frantic ringing of my alarm clock, which
heralded the pleasant prospects of an eight o'clock
class. It was a pity really, because I would have gladly
sacrificed my eight o'clock for what other worldly
advice the sagacious old man could have given me.

Never forget to assure a woman that she is unlike

At this point I was brought back to the world of
reality by the frantic ringing of my alarm clock, which
heralded the pleasant prospects of an eight o'clock
class. It was a pity really, because I would have gladly
sacrificed my eight o'clock for what other worldly
advice the sagacious old man could have given me.
Last week, I had one of those rare occasions when I
was able to complete all my homework while ihe eve
ning was still young. I decided to retire arid peruse
'ihe Works of Mencius, which is one of my favorite
bedside books. After some little time, I fell asleep and
experienced a most extraordinary dream.
I dreamt I was in a musty old room with an antique
bed in the center. Upon the Led lay an old man who
had experience and irony written upon his face. Al
though he was dying, there was still a sparkle in his
eyes. His eyes were naturally lustrous, but his sallow
complexion made them unnaturally so. lie beckoned
me to his bedside and said:
"Never lose your temper at bridge. Never indulge in
slicing when playing golf. Never bet on a sure thing.
Never lose your dignity though you lose your shirt.
Never drink champagne when you can get beer. Never
drink cocktails. Never get drunk on wine. Never
drink coffee with sugar. Never drink coffee with
cream. Never drink coffee.
"Never run short of cigarettes. Never smoke a pipe
until you've reached middle age. Never colli ct stamps.
Never be in possession small change when y<;u go out
with a rich man. Never borrow."
The old man paused for a moment. His eyes roved
slowly around the room, and a faint smile played on

his lips. He continued:
"Never collect press-cuttings. Never write letters
to editors without thinking twice. Never forget that
it is much easier to allow an existing evil to remain
than to try to correct it. Never forget to take English
professors seriously. Never split an infinitive. Never
i'orget that in spite of all that has been said, a frank
person is seldom appreciated.

who are not stupid are usually conceited. Never forget
