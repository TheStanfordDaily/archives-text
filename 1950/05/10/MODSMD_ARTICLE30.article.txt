## Loyalty Oath Compromise 
### 
To the Editor:
In a recent meeting, the non-senate academic em
ployees at Berkeley voted overwhelmingly to reject
the so-called "compromise" of the Academic Senate.
(This non-senate group is made up of teaching as
sistants, lecturers, and other non-tenure employees.)
The feeling of this large organization is that the
substitution ol the "loyalty oath" clause in academic
contracts will be just as dangerous to academic free
dom as the "loyalty oath." The non-senate has there
fore decided to fight this "loyalty clause" by court
action and by the establishment of faculty and com
munity groups to raise funds and enlist public support.

The resolution on which this non-senate group is
fighting reads in part, "No university is an island.
Academic freedom means freedom of teachers and
students to examine all theories in the light of facts
with complete assurance that no particular ideas are
politically required or politically forbidden."
Every thinking Stanford student should attend the
Cubberley Hall meeting tonight on Academic Free
dom to discuss this latest development on the Berkeley
campus. It might be that Stanford students and fac
ulty could lend a helping hand to the non-senate em
ployees.
