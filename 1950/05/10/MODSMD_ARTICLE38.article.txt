# Informality on Row Implies Duties Also
## 
### BEVERLY BOCK 
(Editor's note: This is the last
in a series of features on women's
housing areas.)
For the woman considering life
on the How, there are two measures
to be balanced.
On one side of the scale are the
Row's advantages of small groups,
informal spirit, and numerous ac
tivities. Opposing these are the
weights of responsibility, duties,
and somewhat crowded living con
ditions.
There are nine Row houses, all
former sorority houses and inter
spersed among the fraternities.
They are all on Lasuen Street ex
cept Roth, which is on Santa Ynez,
a side street. At the top of the Row,
about 10 minutes from Quad, is
Durand. Between this house and
Lathrop, at the bottom, are Jordun,
Guthrie, Hurlburt, Cubberley, Rus
sell, and Storey.
House Officers
Each house has its own officers
and system as well as sending rep
resentatives to Row Excom and the
Committee of Nine.
The sizes of rooms and facilities
vary. Generally, the rooms are
rather small and conditions crowd
ed. The houses hold an average of
.'55 girls in doubles and triples. The
girls sleep on sleeping porches or
inside, depending on the house.
The houses have their own cook
ing facilities. In some, these are
open to the girls; while in others
they are not. In most, the girls may
wear pajamas to breakfast, though
Quad clothes are required for other
meals.
Washing and Ironing
Each house has facilities for
washing and ironing, though none
has an automatic washer. Some of
the houses have the added conven
ience of switchboards, while in oth
ers callers just yell.
Special services, such as water
softeners and sheet laundry, ac
count for higher dues in some of
the houses. The average dues are
$5 to 10 per quarter.
The houses take turns each quar
ter housing a student under the
University foreign scholarship pro
gram. Other functions of the Row
as a whole include the annual Row
dance and Row carnival, a scholar
ship awarded each year to a Row
resident, and, frequently, entrance
in campus float parades and other
events.
Social Functions
For the most part, the houses
carry on their own social functions.
Every girl is required to support all
activities of the house, social events
as well as meetings. Fines are im

posed for missing functions without
a valid excuse.
All of the houses have a house
mother, except Russell, which has
a Resident Assistant. Since she is
the only official of the house, be
sides maids and dining staff, the
girls must do many things for them
selves which would be done for
them in a dormitory. Therefore, all
of the houses have duty systems.
In most houses the duties of an
swering the telephone, waking girls
up, preparing after-dinner coffee,
and fixing flowers fall upon the new
girls or the sophomores. Fines are
imposed for not fulfilling these du
ties.
An integral part of Row life is
the key system. Each girl has her
own key and is responsibile for re
turning it to a certain place when
she returns at night. This system
operates on the Fundamental
Standard, since there is no night
assistant to let the girls in. Women
must return their keys by 8 o'clock
in the morning or pay a fine; and a
SK) fine is imposed for losing the
key.
As Elva Bricca, president of the
Row and Jordan House, says, "A
wholehearted effort to participate
actively in Row functions and to as
sume the responsibility of the duties
imposed is a prerequisite to living
on the Row. Only through this co
operative spirit within small living
groups have the advantages asso
ciated with the Row been achieved."

Each house has facilities for
washing and ironing, though none
has an automatic washer. Some of
the houses have the added conven
ience of switchboards, while in oth
ers callers just yell.
Special services, such as water
softeners and sheet laundry, ac
count for higher dues in some of
the houses. The average dues are
$5 to 10 per quarter.
The houses take turns each quar
ter housing a student under the
University foreign scholarship pro
gram. Other functions of the Row
as a whole include the annual Row
dance and Row carnival, a scholar
ship awarded each year to a Row
resident, and, frequently, entrance
in campus float parades and other
events.
Social Functions
For the most part, the houses
carry on their own social functions.
Every girl is required to support all
activities of the house, social events
as well as meetings. Fines are im

posed for missing functions without
a valid excuse.
All of the houses have a house
mother, except Russell, which has
a Resident Assistant. Since she is
the only official of the house, be
sides maids and dining staff, the
girls must do many things for them
selves which would be done for
them in a dormitory. Therefore, all
of the houses have duty systems.
In most houses the duties of an
swering the telephone, waking girls
up, preparing after-dinner coffee,
and fixing flowers fall upon the new
girls or the sophomores. Fines are
imposed for not fulfilling these du
ties.
An integral part of Row life is
the key system. Each girl has her
own key and is responsibile for re
turning it to a certain place when
she returns at night. This system
operates on the Fundamental
Standard, since there is no night
assistant to let the girls in. Women
must return their keys by 8 o'clock
in the morning or pay a fine; and a
SK) fine is imposed for losing the
key.
As Elva Bricca, president of the
Row and Jordan House, says, "A
wholehearted effort to participate
actively in Row functions and to as
sume the responsibility of the duties
imposed is a prerequisite to living
on the Row. Only through this co
operative spirit within small living
groups have the advantages asso
ciated with the Row been achieved."
(Editor's note: This is the last
in a series of features on women's
housing areas.)
For the woman considering life
on the How, there are two measures
to be balanced.
On one side of the scale are the
Row's advantages of small groups,
informal spirit, and numerous ac
tivities. Opposing these are the
weights of responsibility, duties,
and somewhat crowded living con
ditions.
There are nine Row houses, all
former sorority houses and inter
spersed among the fraternities.
They are all on Lasuen Street ex
cept Roth, which is on Santa Ynez,
a side street. At the top of the Row,
about 10 minutes from Quad, is
Durand. Between this house and
Lathrop, at the bottom, are Jordun,
Guthrie, Hurlburt, Cubberley, Rus
sell, and Storey.
House Officers
Each house has its own officers
and system as well as sending rep
resentatives to Row Excom and the
Committee of Nine.
The sizes of rooms and facilities
vary. Generally, the rooms are
rather small and conditions crowd
ed. The houses hold an average of
.'55 girls in doubles and triples. The
girls sleep on sleeping porches or
inside, depending on the house.
The houses have their own cook
ing facilities. In some, these are
open to the girls; while in others
they are not. In most, the girls may
wear pajamas to breakfast, though
Quad clothes are required for other
meals.
