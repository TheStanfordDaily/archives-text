# Engineer Employment
## 
### 
The employment situation for en
gineers isn't as dark as was predict
ed earlier this year, Professor Fred
erick E. Terman, Dean of Engineer
ing, said this week.
A study conducted by the Ameri
can Society of Civil Engineers and
reported in The Daily early in April
indicated a large drop in jobs avail
able for engineering graduates.
However, a report in "Higher Ed
ucation," a publication of the Fed
eral Security Agency, reveals that
there will "soon be fewer engineer
ing graduates available than are
needed annually by our national
economy."
Dean Terman went on to explain
that if the number of engineering
graduates all over the country were
taken as 100, in a year the number
would be 70, 50 in two years, and 40
in three years.
