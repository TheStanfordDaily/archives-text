# Thru Breier's Pipe
## 
### 
'1 lie following bit of information will come as no surprise to any worth
while track fan but—Stanford has the number one and two trackmen in
the country—bar none.
But the Pipe has for you this morning the first, the original, and probably
the most optimistic, rundown on the possible score the Gay Bryan could
total against the field—and Bob Mathias, in the Decathlon.
Mathias is, of course, the champ. Hs mark of 7,556 points in last year's
competition won for him the title. Speculation as to what the Gay one could
do it he tried the 10-event grind has been rampant in the past two years.
Read on, and be in the know.
As a refresher course let us explain that the Decathlon is a two-day event
that calls for an athlete to compete against a set standard. The higher or
longer the jump, the faster the time, the greater the points for each of he
10 events. The trick is to hit all the events well and come up with a highest
amount of points among the contestants.
Glen Morris holds the world's record with the 7,900 points made in the
193U Olympics. Mathias, we repeat, scored 7,55(5 last year.
Bryan has two strikes against him to begin with. Six of the 10 events are
field events. His 178 pounds are not so distributed as to make him a top
flight shotputter, discus tosser, etc.
Mathias, on the other hand, has all the attributes of a champion—which
lie i*. He weighs close to 200 pounds and is fast enough to score well in the
three fiat events and the high hurdles.
The tabulation below will bear some explanation. As mentioned above, it
very optimistic. Bryan has not tried some of the events. The marks in the
high jump and broad jump are his best—he would probably not equal them
in the two-day period. The javelin, shot, and discus marks are only guesses,
but I think the fellow could hit the distances if he gave some time to prac
t icing them.
The first set of marks for Mathias show his distances and times when he
won the event last year at Tulare. The second set show the best marks
since that time and the possible points lie would score if the Decathlon were
to be held Saturday.

The above tabulation shows that Bryan could beat anyone else in the
nation (and world) ex'cept one Bob Mathias. He could (it says here) score
7837, 281 points better than Mathias' 1949 mark. But Bob could score the
8040 total now—4B4 more than his 1949 mark and 1040 more than the record
of Glen Morris.
All of which is rather interesting. But the contest will probably never
come about. Bryan is hot for another trip to Europe. To do this he will
have to win the broad jump or hop-step-and jump at the AAU meet on
June 24. The Decathlon is set for June 29-30 at Tulare. That just doesn't
j-ive enough time for practice. Besides, he has nothing to gain—for, as the
figures show —Bob would win in a hop, step, and jump, and Bryan isn't
used to running second.

two top guards, etc. Schwartz has been experimenting with Gordon
White, Bill McCoH, Bruce Van Alstyne. and others at the linebacking
position Stanford should better its NCAA third-place mark in
track this year. In 1949 the Bruins eased in for second place, 31 to 30.
The Troians were way up there for first place. They should come down
in points and the Cards up—but not enough for first place. UCLA is out
of it.

lie i*. He weighs close to 200 pounds and is fast enough to score well in the
three fiat events and the high hurdles.
The tabulation below will bear some explanation. As mentioned above, it
very optimistic. Bryan has not tried some of the events. The marks in the
high jump and broad jump are his best—he would probably not equal them
in the two-day period. The javelin, shot, and discus marks are only guesses,
but I think the fellow could hit the distances if he gave some time to prac
t icing them.
The first set of marks for Mathias show his distances and times when he
won the event last year at Tulare. The second set show the best marks
since that time and the possible points lie would score if the Decathlon were
to be held Saturday.

The above tabulation shows that Bryan could beat anyone else in the
nation (and world) ex'cept one Bob Mathias. He could (it says here) score
7837, 281 points better than Mathias' 1949 mark. But Bob could score the
8040 total now—4B4 more than his 1949 mark and 1040 more than the record
of Glen Morris.
All of which is rather interesting. But the contest will probably never
come about. Bryan is hot for another trip to Europe. To do this he will
have to win the broad jump or hop-step-and jump at the AAU meet on
June 24. The Decathlon is set for June 29-30 at Tulare. That just doesn't
j-ive enough time for practice. Besides, he has nothing to gain—for, as the
figures show —Bob would win in a hop, step, and jump, and Bryan isn't
used to running second.

two top guards, etc. Schwartz has been experimenting with Gordon
White, Bill McCoH, Bruce Van Alstyne. and others at the linebacking
position Stanford should better its NCAA third-place mark in
track this year. In 1949 the Bruins eased in for second place, 31 to 30.
The Troians were way up there for first place. They should come down
in points and the Cards up—but not enough for first place. UCLA is out
of it.
'1 lie following bit of information will come as no surprise to any worth

the country—bar none.
But the Pipe has for you this morning the first, the original, and probably
the most optimistic, rundown on the possible score the Gay Bryan could
total against the field—and Bob Mathias, in the Decathlon.
Mathias is, of course, the champ. Hs mark of 7,556 points in last year's
competition won for him the title. Speculation as to what the Gay one could
do it he tried the 10-event grind has been rampant in the past two years.
Read on, and be in the know.
As a refresher course let us explain that the Decathlon is a two-day event
that calls for an athlete to compete against a set standard. The higher or
longer the jump, the faster the time, the greater the points for each of he
10 events. The trick is to hit all the events well and come up with a highest
amount of points among the contestants.
Glen Morris holds the world's record with the 7,900 points made in the
193U Olympics. Mathias, we repeat, scored 7,55(5 last year.
Bryan has two strikes against him to begin with. Six of the 10 events are
field events. His 178 pounds are not so distributed as to make him a top
flight shotputter, discus tosser, etc.
Mathias, on the other hand, has all the attributes of a champion—which

TOTALS 7837 755(5 8040
The above tabulation shows that Bryan could beat anyone else in the
nation (and world) ex'cept one Bob Mathias. He could (it says here) score
7837, 281 points better than Mathias' 1949 mark. But Bob could score the
8040 total now—4B4 more than his 1949 mark and 1040 more than the record
of Glen Morris.
All of which is rather interesting. But the contest will probably never
come about. Bryan is hot for another trip to Europe. To do this he will
have to win the broad jump or hop-step-and jump at the AAU meet on
June 24. The Decathlon is set for June 29-30 at Tulare. That just doesn't
j-ive enough time for practice. Besides, he has nothing to gain—for, as the
figures show —Bob would win in a hop, step, and jump, and Bryan isn't
used to running second.

short many, many men. Injuries have wiped out the center spot, taken
two top guards, etc. Schwartz has been experimenting with Gordon
White, Bill McCoH, Bruce Van Alstyne. and others at the linebacking
position Stanford should better its NCAA third-place mark in
track this year. In 1949 the Bruins eased in for second place, 31 to 30.
The Troians were way up there for first place. They should come down
in points and the Cards up—but not enough for first place. UCLA is out
of it.
'1 lie following bit of information will come as no surprise to any worth
while track fan but—Stanford has the number one and two trackmen in
the country—bar none.
But the Pipe has for you this morning the first, the original, and probably
the most optimistic, rundown on the possible score the Gay Bryan could
total against the field—and Bob Mathias, in the Decathlon.
Mathias is, of course, the champ. Hs mark of 7,556 points in last year's
competition won for him the title. Speculation as to what the Gay one could
do it he tried the 10-event grind has been rampant in the past two years.
Read on, and be in the know.
As a refresher course let us explain that the Decathlon is a two-day event
that calls for an athlete to compete against a set standard. The higher or
longer the jump, the faster the time, the greater the points for each of he
10 events. The trick is to hit all the events well and come up with a highest
amount of points among the contestants.
Glen Morris holds the world's record with the 7,900 points made in the
193U Olympics. Mathias, we repeat, scored 7,55(5 last year.
Bryan has two strikes against him to begin with. Six of the 10 events are
field events. His 178 pounds are not so distributed as to make him a top
flight shotputter, discus tosser, etc.
Mathias, on the other hand, has all the attributes of a champion—which
lie i*. He weighs close to 200 pounds and is fast enough to score well in the
three fiat events and the high hurdles.
The tabulation below will bear some explanation. As mentioned above, it
very optimistic. Bryan has not tried some of the events. The marks in the
high jump and broad jump are his best—he would probably not equal them
in the two-day period. The javelin, shot, and discus marks are only guesses,
but I think the fellow could hit the distances if he gave some time to prac
t icing them.
The first set of marks for Mathias show his distances and times when he
won the event last year at Tulare. The second set show the best marks
since that time and the possible points lie would score if the Decathlon were
to be held Saturday.
