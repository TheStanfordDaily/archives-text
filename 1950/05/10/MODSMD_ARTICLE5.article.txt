### 
15 K KI.IN A Russian proposal
that all occupation troops be re
moved from Berlin as a prelude to
a "free and democratic" city elec
tion was rebuffed by anti-Commu
nist Germans and Western Allied
spokesmen alike today.
French Maj. Gen. Jean Ganeval
spoke most plainly for the Western
powers, whose garrisons the Rus
sians would like to see sent 100
mi'es to Western Germany. He said
the Soviet proposal cannot be taken |
seriously.
