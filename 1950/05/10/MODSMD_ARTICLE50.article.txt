# Indian Diamonders Drop A Game in Broncs' Laps
## 
### 
Stanford's baseballing Indians
were rudely thrown out of their
CIBA driver's seat yesterday after
noon by a bucking Santa Clara
Bronco who piled up a seven-run
advantage in the first five innings
and then coasted home to a ridicu
lously easy 10 to 4 victory.
The loss dropped the Cards' lead
to a thin half-game over the fast
finishing Southern California Tro
jans, and puts the pressure square
ly on the Indians to gain at least a
split out of their two-game series
with the Troymen this weekend or
give it up and try again next year.
The Broncs, who have had a
tough time winning their share this
season, put it away in a hurry
yesterday afternoon. Jack Heinen
started on the hill lor Stanford op
posing the Broncs' Hal Toso, but
the job of getting the. side out
proved too much for Heinen who
retired with two on and nobody out
in the filth after giving up four runs
on ten hits and two walks.
Successors Dave Stott and Jim
Claypool didn't fare much better,
although Stott did manage to cool
the visiting Broncos off for a couple
ol innings before the game blew up
in his face in the eighth inning.
In all, Santa Clara rattled the
three Card chuckers for 18 hits—
many of them of the extra base, va
riety, while Toso. who has had bet

ter days, effectively distributed 11
safeties.
