# MOOT COURT
## Preliminary Round Tonight 
### 
Interracial marriage will be the
problem under consideration to
night at 8:15 in the preliminary
rounds of the Moot Court compe
tition in the Law School.
The argumentation will be car
ried on by Nancy Stookey and Vic
tor Lobe, appellants, and Lewis
Butler and Clayton Janssen, re
spondents.
Effectiveness of the contestants in
tonight's public Moot Court hear
ing will be decided by Sylvester
Garrett, professor of the Law
School; Byron Kabot, San Fran
cisco attorney; and Clifford Duke,
third-year law student.
The problem of interracial mar
riage was also argued Monday
night. The case affects a white man
and his fiancee who was one-fourth
Indian. They applied for a marriage
license in the imaginary state of
Stanford, and were refused by a
Stanford official.
The official's refusal stemmed
from a statute in the state of Stan
ford which prohibited marriages
between whites and other races.
Contending that the Stanford anti
miscegenation statute violates the
14th amendment to the Federal
Constitution, the couple complained
to the federal district attorney.
The district attorney then insti
tuted prosecution of the Stanford
official under the Federal Criminal
Code which makes it a federal
crime to deprive a person of any
federal right under code of law. The
Stanford official is liable for deny
ing a federal right under color of
local law.
Clerk of the court tonight will be
Dudley Goul.
Tonight's hearing is the next to
last in these preliminary rounds of
the 1950-51 competition in the Stan
ford Moot Court of Appeals.
