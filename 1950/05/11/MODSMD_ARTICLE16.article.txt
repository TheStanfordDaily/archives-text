# NSA Forum Blasts Oath In Education
## 
### 
Three faculty members and a stu
dent went on record as opposing a
loyalty oath in any university, at
the NSA forum on academic free
dom last night.
Henry Blauth, Stanford German
instructor, pointed out that when a
teacher allows himself to become
emotional about a particular ideol
ogy, his objective outlook is dam
aged. He emphasized that teachers
—the "pillars of a civilization"—
have a responsibility to society to
preserve the true values of a po
litical theory.
Blauth said that in 1936 at the
University of Berlin, where he was
once a student, the Nazi Adminis
trator of Education delivered an in
sulting address to the assembled
faculty of the University. Not one
of the teachers had the courage to
walk out on the Nazi.
Philip W. Buck, professor of po
litical science here, stated that in
England a person may talk of revo
lution as much as he wishes. How
ever, only if revolution acually oc
curs will action be taken against the
instigator of the trouble.
He emphasized the vital need of
an objective attitude on the part of
the teacher.
Professor Wallace Stegner, Stan
ford professor of English and an au
thor, said he resigned from the fac
ulty of a small denominational Il
linois college because the college
board feared he was an agnostic and
an atheist.
He showed how the strict censor
ship of that college by outside
groups had kept the school from
having a good faculty, a good li
brary, and real intellectual inquiry.
Stegner said that tlie faculty must
share an active part in the adminis
tration of any college or university.
Carl Stover, sophomore political
sciencc major, expressed the view
point that the best basis for judg
ing teachers is their competency as
a teacher. He further stated that,
the hysteria and fear over Commu
nism rather than Communism itself
is to be feared most. He again em
phasized objectivity — espeeia'ly in
dealing with the question of Com
munism.
