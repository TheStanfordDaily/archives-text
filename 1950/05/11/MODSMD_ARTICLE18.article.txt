# Four Railroad Strikes Cripple Major Lines
## More Than One-third of Passenger Channels Affected Coast-to-Coast 
### 
CHICAGO, May 10 (AP) —Locomotive firemen struck today on
four key systems that carry more than a third of the nation's rail
passengers and a fifth of the rail freight.
The strike crippled operations on these lines in the East, West,
and South and disrupted service on some other railroads that lease

tracks from the struck roads.
There were no signs of early settle
ment.
The National (Railway) Mediation
Board gave up the peace struggle as
hopeless, several hours after the
strike was under way. The board
sent a report on the deadlock to
Washington.
An official of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen
said the union had offered, under
certain conditions, to drop its de
mand for an extra fireman on big
diesel locomotives. It also is asking
that a fireman be employed on small
switch diesels now operated by a
single engineer. The carriers de
clared they would not compromise,
even if the strike spreads to other
lines.
Washington Conference
There were indications the next
move would be for John R. Steelman,
presidential assistant, to call the
parties into a conference in Wash
ington.
Steelman told reporters in the
capital, however, that he had no
present intention of calling a meet-

ing. He indicated the problem was
still in the hands of the mediation
board.
In Chicago, Francis A. O'Neill Jr.,
chairman of the mediation board,
said he had conferred with Steelman.
After their talk, he said, the board
decided to remain in Chicago for a
few days to be available to either
side for consultation.
Seizure Doubtful
Some government officials in
Washington expressed doubt that
President Truman would — or even
could—seize the struck lines.
He has that authority under a war
time seizure law invoked in 1917 in
event of an emergency.
However, these officials said a
court might not be "too impressed"
with the emergency nature of the
present strike. It is limited to four
lines and these officials say emer
gency shipments can be made on
other lines.
The union's strategy in calling the
strike was to avoid creating an emer
gency that could justify government
seizure.
The effect of the strike was almost
instantaneous. Coal began piling up
at Western Pennsylvania mines
served by the struck Pennsylvania
Railroad.
Railroads report that the strike of
18,000 firemen could force from 50.-
000 to 100,000 other workers into
idleness in a short time.
Operations of the Santa Fc Railway
were restricted to a single roundtrip
run in the San Francisco Bay region
today as the strike hit the nation.
The Golden Gate streamliner went
from Oakland to Bakersfield and re
turned with supervisory personnel
replacing the striking firemen. Union
sources said 100 trainmen arc on
strike in this area.
