President Truman outlined tonight
an ambitious program of national
development aimed at boosting the
income of poorer working families
to $4,000 annually in 10 years.
In his busiest day of speech mak
ing since he left Washington Sunday
on a 6,000-mile lour, the President,
in a Pendleton, Ore., speech, pre
dicted that the income of those in
the lower brackets can be doubled
in "real" money and the nation's
output of goods and services lifted
to $350,000,000,000 by 19(30 and dis
missed as "silly nonsense" Repub
lican charges that his "Fair Deal"
program will lead to Socialism.
