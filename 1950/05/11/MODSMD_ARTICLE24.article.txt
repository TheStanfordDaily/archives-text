# BULL SESSION

### JOHN HALL 
Someplace in school there should be ;i com ";e taught,
on how to take notes.
Last year I was a member of the class of '50 who
expected to be graduating in IJJSO. This year I'm not
so sure, and it's all because of my ability for taking

lecture notes.
Some profs are just naturally
last talkers. Others merely culti
vate the habit to confuse you.
It you miss 10 seconds, you're
finished. During the time it takes
you to put away your dried-up
pen, nudge your neighbor for his
extra pencil, and finish swearing
at your lousy pen, a man such as
Louie the 14th can get married,
have 17 children (11 illegitimate,
but still quite a feat), declare war

on Spain, anil sign a secret treaty with England.
Of course, you can always lean over and copy from
those sitting down tile row, but you can never tell
what you are getting into. One girl in my row is the
kind who takes down every word from "Good morn
ing, class" to "We'll talk about that tomorrow." She
even gets in the coughs, cleared-throats, and the
"ah's."
When the prof notices that a large number of stu
dents have missed the point, he signals the reader to
jot it down, and he uses it for a question in the next
exam.
This is a process which is known as separating the
men from the boys, and is the foundation for Stan
ford's world-famous grading system the curve.
One of the best kind of note takers is the guy who
has had the prof before and has got his style com
pletely cooled. This guy eases back in his chair, lis
tens casually, and then when the prof makes a key
statement, he writes it down in big letters, puts a star
or an asterisk by it, and smiles confidently as he re
laxes back into his chair again.
During seminars before the exams this ; uv will

generously tell you not to worry about a thing, that
he has the course condensed, there's nothing to strain
over, take it easy.
That's the time when the prof decides to revamp
his testing system and change his style. Or better yet,
he tells his reader to make up the exam. That really
louses things up.
You finally realize that there is no way to beat it,
and you end up saying that someplace in school there
should be a course taught on how to take notes.

Now that we have philosophized on life in the big
University, we can turn to things of the moment.
COLLEGE HUMOR: Just about everybody has had
a toothache, a bad cold, a morning after, or a date
with a Koble girl. These things will immediately strike
you as being almost as miserable as things can get.
Falling into the same category is the tong brother who
wants you to do something for him. In this case it
happens to be the printing of his joke, and I can't fight
if off any longer.
It seems that Cab Calloway has a wife who couldn't
water her front lawn. And do you know why .she can't
water her front lawn?
Well, Cab hi-dee-ho's that's why. Isn't that a killer?
Good old tong brothers. Next time I'll take the tooth
ache.
lIOOYER TOWER: Yesterday 1 happened to read
The Stanford Daily, honest, and I noticed a front page
story saying that the vice-chairman of the Hoover
Institute and Library estimated that it would cost up
to $50 to keep the library ojjen on Sunday.
I would not disagree with the vice-chairman, but for
half of that sum, 1 hereby offer to open up the Tower
each Sunday, guarantee that the sacred documents
will be safeguarded, and serve lemonade in the ele
vator.
ERRORS AGAIN: It seems that the clinker last
Monday saying that Bob Mathias was 18 (he's 19) was
not linotypographical but rather typographical. Now
let's see my typewriter get sore at me.
