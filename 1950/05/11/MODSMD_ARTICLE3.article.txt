## 
### 
LONDON France and the Unit
ed States appeared to be strongly
united tonight on a policy of tying
Germany into Western Europe in
dustrially and politically.
There was doubt, however, as to
Britain's attitude.
Secretary of State Dean Acheson
issued a statement giving sympathy
and approval to the "significance
and far-reaching intent" of the sur
prise French offer yesterday to pool
French, German, and possibly other
European coal and steel production.
This proposal dominacd top-level
diplomatic thinking today in Lon
don, where Acheson and British
Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin
held two long secret discussions on
German and other phases of the
cold war.
