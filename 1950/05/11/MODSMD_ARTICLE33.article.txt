# Farm Roads Handed May Spray by 'Yard'
## 
### 
"When the sun comes up and the rain goes out, the oil trucks
come 'round and they all begin to spout â€”"
That's twisting the song a bit, but at Stanford, good weather
means the Corporation Yard can proceed in its yearly "protective
maintenance" work on Farm roads.
The Yard, Stanford's source of workmen, equipment, and mate-

rials, is currently spraying oil and*
spreading gravel on the stretch ol |
Escondido road from Arguello street |
to Branner Hall. Workmen have al- |
ready completed a protective cover- I
ing on ail of Coronado avenue, much
of Salvatierra street, about one hall
of Alvarado row, and Arguello street
from Alvarado to Lasuen street.
"This oil and gravel covering
doesn't really improve the roads,"
explained Carroll Blacker, superin-
I tendent ol buildings and grounds. "It
I protects them, keeps them from de
teriorating any farther than they
I have."
This preservation measure costs
about $20,0U0 a year, blacker said.
Actual reconstruction would cost
much more.
Also in line for "protective main- j
tenance" this year is Lasuen street
from May Held avenue to the Quad,
and from the north side of Quad to
the Faculty Clubhouse.
A real repaving job, to be done by
outside contractors in the near fu
ture, is planned for Galvez street
along Stern Hall and Crothers Hall,
and for the block of Escondido road
in front of Stern.
