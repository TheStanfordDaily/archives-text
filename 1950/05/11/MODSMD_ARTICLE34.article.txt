# S & B Pledges To Lug Rifles
## 
### 
No, those characters you'll see
lugging rifles around tomorrow will
not be soldiers protecting the cam
pus. In fact, the rifles won't even
be real.
The men will be passing the re
quirement of initiation for Scabbard
and Blade fraternity (for senior
ROTC students), and must carry the
mock weapons around with them all
day, according to pledge captain
Bob Volk.
Next Friday, May 19, they will
be initiated at a formal ceremony,
followed in the evening by a ban
quet and party at Chez Yvonne. A
highlight of the party will be the
appearance of Col. Leo M. Cook,
one of the founders of the organi
zation in 1905.
