## Indians Face Mighty Troy In Crucial Series 
### BILL SWIGART 
The dark-horse Stanford Indians
and the last-finishing Southern Cal
ifornia Trojans thunder into the
home stretch of the tightest CIBA
race in 15 years this weekend as
the two teams meet on Bovard Field
in Los Angeles in a two-game series
that will either decide this year's
winner or throw the whole stand
ings into a hopeless state of con
fusion.
Still out in front but tiring notice
ably, the Stanfords will throw ev
erything they have into an all-out
effort to stave off the Trojans'
stretch drive. One victory this
weekend will put the league title
into a potential tie, and probably
necessitate a playoff series between
the two front - runners after the
regular season is over. Two victo
ries for the Cards would give them
a two-and-a-half-step lead in the
standings and almost cinch their
first league title in 19 years. The
same holds true for the Trojans ex
cept that they have won all the
marbles in the CIBA for the past
two years in a row.
Both of these suppositions pre
suppose, of course, that the series
victor will be able to win its final
week's games. The Trojans will
have three games left to play and
the Indians two.
Third - place Santa Clara and
fourth-place California will see ac
tion this weekend in their battle for
the runner-up spots. Santa Clara
will play host to St. Mary's at
Washington Park tomorrow night,
while the Bears make the trip south
for a two-game series with their
Westwood cousins.
Neither team appears to have a
chance for the top spot unless both
Stanford and USC should go into a
losing streak the final week. In such
case the league would go into a
three- or four-way tie and a play
off series would be necessitated.
The Card baseballers will depart
on the Lark tonight and will make
their headquarters at the Chapman
Park Hotel in Los Angeles.
