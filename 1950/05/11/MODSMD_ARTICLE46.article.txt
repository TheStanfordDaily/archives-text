# Frosh Horsehiders Edge Menlo 8 to 7
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
.In one of the most inartistic
games of the season, a ragged Stan
ford frosh baseball team prevailed
over an even more ragged Menlo JC
outfit, 8 to 7, on the frosh diamond
yesterday. A total of 12 errors were
committed.
Despite the unprofessional style
of play, the game did not lack for
excitement. The Papooses had to
overcome a 7 to 6 ninth-inning lead
to squeak in with their sixth
straight win.
Gene Shirley, speedy little left
fielder, led off the last of the ninth
with a trajectory - type blow into
center. Pitcher Bones Lamborn, in
an attempt to catch Shirley off first,
threw wild and Shirley wound up at
third. Shirley completed the cycle
a moment later when first baseman
Jim Agar shot a sizzling single past
second.
John Knoeppel then hit a
grounder to third baseman Taft,
who, in keeping with the theme of
the day, threw it wild, allowing
Agar to advance. With Agar now
on third, Doug Shumway put down
a beautiful bunt and Agar came
lumbering in with the tie-breaking
run.
Stanford scored in each of the
first five innings. In the initial
frame, shortstop Dick Cole walked,
went to third on Jack Shepard's sin
gle, and came in on A 1 Stellar's
deep fiy to center. The Cardbabes
made it 3 to 0 in the second as

Clayton McGill singled and ad
vanced to third on the first of eight
errors- the Oaks were to commit.
Jim Harding and Norm Rundquist
then provoked walks from pitcher
Norm Thomas. McGill tallied on
Boyer's fly to center and Harding
stole home a moment later.
Menlo reached Ron Boyer for a
run of their own in the fourth as
they nursed two singles and a wild
pitch into a run.
Stanford made it 5 to 1 in the
fourth as Frank Yapp got life on a
Texas leaguer and scored on a Cole
propelled ball to left that Bill Man
heimer challenged but didn't get. It
was 6 to 1 in the next inning as
Harding walked and later scored
The Oaks proved they were still
in the ball game as they undressed
Boyer with three straight singles,
one run scoring. They reached the
now-tiring Boyer lor three more
in the seventh. Bob Murphy came
in to pitch the eighth and ninth
frames and was greeted with two
unearned runs as Menlo forged
ahead, 7 to G. Then came the afore
mentioned last-inning rally.
