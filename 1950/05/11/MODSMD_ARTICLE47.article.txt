# Crew Battles Trojans Here
## 
### 
Stanford students will have an
opportunity to see their crew in ac
tion on home waters Saturday when
the oarsmen meet USC for the sec
ond time this season.
The varsity and junior varsity
shells will be pitted against two
boatloads from SC, at 10:15 and 9:30
a.m. respectively.
Stanford crews scored a clean
sweep over USC earlier in the
spring. Last week the varsity lost
to Cal by a length and a half on the
Oakland Estuary.
Spectators may see the races by
driving to the foot of the Embarca
dero, where they will be directed
to parking places. All races are
2,000 meters.
