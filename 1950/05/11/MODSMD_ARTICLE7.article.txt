# Excom Discusses Election Policies
## Clarification of By-Laws Recommended for Future 
### 
Excom handed Election Board three recommendations last night
in hopes of smoothing over the rough spots which cropped up
during this year's elections.
The recommendations were presented by ASSU President Hank
Rosin as Excom members fired questions at Election Chairman

Cliff Carlsen.
The main grievance against this
year's practices was expressed by
men's halls representative Gregg
Bemis who said that Election Board
members had given candidates mis
guided information on electioneering
regulations. In one case, he said, a
candidate was convicted of a viola
tion after acting on a by-law inter
pretation of the laws given him by
an Election Board member.
Excom recommended that Election
Board delegate one member to an
swer queries concerning election by
laws, leaving to the candidate the
interpretation. An interpretation
still can be requested by writing
Election Judgment Board.
Secondly, Excom recommended
that campaign regulations be pub
lished in The Daily.
Carlsen said that it had been diffi
cult for Election Board to keep up
with the new election by-laws this
year, since Excom passed one "about
every other week."
Judgment Board
Election Judgment Board pro
cedure was the subject of questions
fired to Carlsen and Bemis, both
members of the board. The discus
sion was opened when Rosin read a
letter from John A. Morrow Jr. ask
ing Excom to insure stricter enforce
ment of election regulations.
Excom signified its approval of the
structure of the five-man board.
In answer to questioning, Bemis
said the board did not hold a meet
ing this spring before reviewing the
first violation, but some of the mem
bers had met during winter elec
tons. '
Carlsen answered a question re
garding the board's sentencing a stu
dent for tearing down campaign
signs without waiting for the student
to appear in his own defense. Carl
sen said the board couldn't get hold
of the student.
Run-Around
"It looked like he was giving us
the run-around," he said. "We were
already pretty sure he was guilty."
Excom's recommendation was that
the Election Judgment Board next
year draw up rules for procedure
that it can follow to give it the status
of a board "rather than an inquisi
tion."
Rosin said that member-elect Gil
Jonas' request for clarification of the
by-laws regarding the distribution
of handbills was up to next year's
Excom.
Excom was asked to consider
whether the minimum sentence of 15
hours for campaign violations was
too harsh. Rosin limited considera
tion to this year's circumstances, and
the representatives expressed ap
proval of the present minimum.
A by-law amendment was ap
proved prohibiting a candidate dis
qualified in the primaries for viola
tions from running in the final elec
tion.
Senior Seminar
On the subject of student-faculty
relations, Rosin told Excom th tJ t the
senior seminar program was ready
for operation.
Ten students will be chosen to meet
with five faculty representatives in
the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment to evaluate the department's
academic program. The program
may extend to the Political Science
Department by the end of the quar
ter.
Reporting on the trial faculty
rating program. Rosin said that fac
ulty response was five times as fa
vorable as during the fall quarter.
Plans are being made to carry on the
rating this spring.
New Committee
The old Social Policies Committee
was transformed into the Funda
mental Standard Committee by Ex
com and its duties broadened.
The new committee will be respon
sible for interpreting Fundamental
Standard and social policies ques
tions and orientating the student
body on both.
The board will be made up of
seven members chosen by interview.

Carlsen answered a question re
garding the board's sentencing a stu

signs without waiting for the student
to appear in his own defense. Carl
sen said the board couldn't get hold
of the student.
Run-Around
"It looked like he was giving us
the run-around," he said. "We were
already pretty sure he was guilty."
Excom's recommendation was that
the Election Judgment Board next
year draw up rules for procedure
that it can follow to give it the status
of a board "rather than an inquisi
tion."
Rosin said that member-elect Gil
Jonas' request for clarification of the
by-laws regarding the distribution
of handbills was up to next year's
Excom.
Excom was asked to consider
whether the minimum sentence of 15
hours for campaign violations was
too harsh. Rosin limited considera

the representatives expressed ap
proval of the present minimum.
A by-law amendment was ap

"New laws every other week"'
Excom handed Election Board three recommendations last night
in hopes of smoothing over the rough spots which cropped up
during this year's elections.
The recommendations were presented by ASSU President Hank
Rosin as Excom members fired questions at Election Chairman

Cliff Carlsen.
The main grievance against this
year's practices was expressed by
men's halls representative Gregg
Bemis who said that Election Board
members had given candidates mis
guided information on electioneering
regulations. In one case, he said, a
candidate was convicted of a viola
tion after acting on a by-law inter
pretation of the laws given him by
an Election Board member.
Excom recommended that Election
Board delegate one member to an
swer queries concerning election by
laws, leaving to the candidate the
interpretation. An interpretation
still can be requested by writing
Election Judgment Board.
Secondly, Excom recommended
that campaign regulations be pub
lished in The Daily.
Carlsen said that it had been diffi
cult for Election Board to keep up
with the new election by-laws this
year, since Excom passed one "about
every other week."
Judgment Board
Election Judgment Board pro
cedure was the subject of questions
fired to Carlsen and Bemis, both
members of the board. The discus
sion was opened when Rosin read a
letter from John A. Morrow Jr. ask
ing Excom to insure stricter enforce
ment of election regulations.
Excom signified its approval of the
structure of the five-man board.
In answer to questioning, Bemis
said the board did not hold a meet
ing this spring before reviewing the
first violation, but some of the mem
bers had met during winter elec
tons. '
