Palo Alto residents. Winter quarter
the group participated in the Stu
dent - Faculty Talent Show, spon
sored by the Red Cross Drive, and
presented two numbers at Stern
Hall's open house.
"Sing Capades" culminates a re

building program that the club has
undergone in the past two years.
The Men's Glee Club at Stanford
has had a long history of ups and
downs since its founding in 1891.
A group of students started the
organization, then known as the
"Encinal Glee." This organization
was short-lived, but a "Glee Quar
tet" was combined in 1802 with the
"Mandolin Club." This quartet, fur
nished the nucleus for the first real
Glee Club, a student - led group
which was active until the first
World War, when, along with most

campus organizations, it was dis
continued.
Fto!lowing the war the club was
reorganized under the direction of
Warren D. Allen, who brought the
membership up to about 70 mem
bers in 1924. Patterned after the
famous Harvard Glee Club, the
Stanford group became a well
known choral group in the West,
going on many profitable tours and
commercial engagements.
In 1927 Dr. Allen resigned. Uni
versity financial support was with
drawn, and the ASSU took over the
organization.
The club continued its activities
under Charles A. Kuhlman, but the
depression hit the off-campus activ
ities of the group, so that by 1935
the club was practically a defunct
organization.
War-time Collapse
Until 1042 there was a succession
of directors and little campus in
terest in the club. The total collapse
of the group, which came at the be
ginning of World War 11, went prac
tically unnoticed.
Since the war there has been only
one year in which the organization
partially attained its previous prom
inence. In the school year 1947-48,
James Schwabacher took over the
directorship and led the club in
several on- and off-campus presen
tations.
"The interest shown recently
gives us hope that the Glee Club
will grow in the next few years, and
once again assume its place as an
active, contributing campus organi
zation," said Buz Howe, club presi
dent.
