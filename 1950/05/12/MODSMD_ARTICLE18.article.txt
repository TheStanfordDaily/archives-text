# PRELIMINARY ROUNDS
## Homestead Act Will Receive Final Moot Court Arguments 
### 
Final competition in the prelimi
nary rounds of the 1950-51 Stanford
Moot Court of Appeals will be held
tonight in the Moot Court room of
the new Law School. The public
mock trial begins at 8:15.
Discussing the constitutionality of
a state homestead act will be Henry
Whitcover and Merle Sessions, ap
pellants, and Gerry Wolfson and
Harvey Himmel, respondents.
They will present their cases to
judges Charles Corker, professor of
law; Casper Weinberger, San Fran
cisco attorney; and Dick Outcault,
third-year law student. Clifford
Duke will act as bailiff.
Hypothetical Case
In tonight's hypothetical problem,
the defendant owns a home, worth
less than $5,000 in 1935, in the
imaginary state of Stanford. Under
the state law in 1935, his home and
all homes valued at less than $5,000
were exempted from forced sale.
The defendant became indebted
to the plaintiff in 1935, but not until

1948 did the plaintifT sue the de
fendant for the debt and recover a
judgment.
In the intervening years, because
of real estate inflation, the same
home the defendant ov/ricd in 1935
is now worth $8,500.
To combat the real estate infla
tion, the state legislature increased
the homestead exemption in 1947 to
an amount compatible with the in
flation.
Act Unconstitutional ,
The revised exemption is -uncon
stitutional, claims the plaintifT, who
seeks to cause the defendant's home
to be sold in satisfaction of the
debt. The plaintifT points out that
the homestead exemption in 1935
($5,000) is all that the defendant
has a right to have.
f-lis reasoning is that the exemp
tion in effect at the time the debt
was incurred is the only legal ex
emption. To apply the 1947 re
vised exemption to his 1935 debt
claim would impair the obligation
of contract, which is forbidden by
the Federal Constitution.
The defendant, however, claims
that he is entitled to the increased
homesstead exemption, and conse
quently cannot be forced to sell his
home.
