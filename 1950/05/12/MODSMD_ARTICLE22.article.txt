# Horn, Kerkorian Head Card Squads In Big Spring Grid Tilt Tomorrow
## 
### AL BERRY 
Civil war will be the order of the
day tomorrow at 2 p.m. as Head
Football Coach Marchie Schwartz
herds 79 members of the 1950 Big
Red Machine onto the Stadium turf
for the annual Big Spring Game.
As per usual when the warmness
of summer creeps into the air, the
squad has been divided into two
camps—the Red and the White—and
each will try to perform their best in
front of 1) the all-knowing coach
ing staff, 2) the all-seeing motion
picture camera, and) 3 the all-hoping
Stanford student body.
Quarterback Dick Horn's white
shirts will go into the game-like (ex
cept for kick-offs) fracas coin-flip
favorites over Gary Kerkorian's Reds
—mostly because of the likelihood of
absence of Kerkorian himself. Last
year's starting quarterback suffered a
shoulder injury a week ago and may
spend the day on the bench in favor
of 1949's Junicy- Varsity qb, Jack
Bickel. Bickel calls his plays well,
and fakes well, but lacks the throw
ing arm of either Kerkorian or the
white shirt leader.
White Line-up
Dick Horn's eleven will have '49's
two defensive aces, Bruce Van Al
styne and Jack Rye, at the end spots.
The tackles will be big blond Russ
Pomeroy and old-face-made-good in
the person of Ted Taylor. Guards

will be Jess Cone and Owen Powell,
while big Don Tobin, top-flight
rugby player, will fill in the pivot
post for the White machine.
Assisting Horn in the backfield of
the Whiteshirts will be halfbacks
Boyd Benson and Eric Southwood,
and the fullback Holy Boruck.
Southwood, however, has had hip
pointer trouble the last few days and
may not be ready to go. If such be
the case Bill McKay, a pint-sized
speedster, will fill the right halfback
post.
McColl for the Reds
Carrying through for the Redshirts
will be Stanford's top end Bill McColl
and a JV wingman who, according to
Coach Schwartz, has been playing
excellent ball this spring, Bob Scot!
The tackle spots will be amply filled
by two-year letterman Gordy Whit"
and freshman star John Broderick.
Original guards for the Redmen were
freshman player-of-the-year Norm
Manoogian and Compton JC transfer
Rod Garner. Garner, however, ha:;
got ankle trouble, so freshman John
Hilson may get the starting nod. At.
center for the Reds will be Stan
ford's most promising offensive pivot
man, Doug Thamer, a sophomore
with a year of JV and frosh ball be
hind him.
Sparking the Kerkorians (or Bick
elians) will be right halfback Boh
White, the Cards' favorite game
buster for the past two years, and
Dick—Blondy—Broome, a small but
rugged bone-crusher, at the left half
spot. At fullback for the Redmen will
be Bob Griffin —the fourth fullback
of 1949, who looks very much like
the first fullback for 1950.
Last Chance
Thus the sides line up for the cam
pus' last look at the Big Red until
after the second game of next fall';,
fearsome tussles. The first two
scheduled tilts of autumn are sched
uled before the open of school -SJS
and USF, here.
In all probability, the above-named
22 will see relatively little action
Saturday, since the coaches are plan
ning to follow their regular spring
custom of taking a look at everybody
The benches will probably be cleared
four or five times before the day's
work is over. But who plays, and
who wins will be somewhat imma
terial Saturday to the old hnads who
will turn out for the tilt. The im
portant thing is that football is back
on the Farm.
And that should give the folk.,
something to talk about.


THE CARRIER: Bobby White,
ace Cardinal riftht halfback, will
spark the Red team as the 1950
Stanford Touchdown Cluh makes
its last prc-season appearance to
morrow.


THE THINKER: Clark Shaugh
ncssy, under whom the T forma
tion was born at Stanford ten
years ago, will he on hand tomor
row for his first spring game since
1941.
