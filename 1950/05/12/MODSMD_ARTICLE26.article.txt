# Let's Study the Charity Poll
## 
### 
With the last of Stanford's three main charity
drives under the belt for the year, it is time to
analyze their relative importance.
Excom has started the ball rolling by con
ducting a poll of 800 students. Post cards will
be sent out the first of next week for student
evaluation.
The drives listed on the poll will include fled
Cross, Cancer, Infantile Paralysis, small na
tional charities (e.g., Negro College Fund), in
ternational relief for education (e.g., University
of Naples and the Free University of Berlin),
and CARE.
The selection of these national and interna
tional charities seems to fill out the picture
rather well when combined with the local gifts
to the Palo Alto Youth Fund and the Conva
lescent Home.
In the past the fall relief drive pushed by
the lIR has been handled as the SIRO drive.
Although this drive is composed of two parts,
the foreign relief fund and a floating fund, it
has been presented to the campus basically as
international relief.
This is not a fair evaluation of the drive. In
cluded also in the SIRO drive are funds chan
neled to the Palo Alto Youth Fund. Ironically
enough, the 30 per cent quota which went to
this charity amounted to only $1,500. Yet from
this fund came $6,000 to help the Stanford
YWCA, the second largest club on campus.
The fall drive exists not for just the UNESCO,
CARE, and World Student Service. The small
national charities such as the Negro College
Fund, the Palo Alto Youth Fund, and the Crip
pled Children's Society, all reserve some part
in the publicity for the fall charity drive.
Next year the drive will be directed by Car
dinals in an effort to get a more well-rounded
drive — not strictly international and not en
tirely local—but one tuned to the pitch estab
lished by Excom's poll.
The winter charity project has been domi
nated in the past by the Red Cross. The Polio
March of Dimes has slowed down to a notice
able extent although it is a very worthy cause.
Other drives have won some support
through mailed requests for individual gifts. It
seems only fair to re-evaluate the winter quar
ter drive to see if there is a student reaction to
redivide the funds among the national chari
ties.
By putting all the charities in one big drive,
Derek Bok and Kay Wold, who are handling the
poll, hope to reduce the nuisance of a charity
drive being conducted every other week.
A poll can only be successful if the students
realize the functions of each charity.
For instance, of the $5,000 quota which goes
to the American Cancer Society from the Palo
Alto-Stanford area, 60 per cent is retained by
the local organizations in Santa Clara County.
Stanford professors in the School of Medi
cine, and the Departments of Biology and
Chemistry have several grants from both the
Cancer and Infantile Paralysis funds for study
ing cures for the diseases.
Cancer funds have been used for cancer edu
cation, cancer clinics, and financial aid to can
cer patients in this area.
The Red Cross life saving instruction, aid to
veteraas' families, and work with the Stanford
Mothers' Club are well-known projects.
The local significance of the charity drives,
however, is not the real reason for student sup
port. It is a much more humanitarian instinct

that leads to success in donations of this kind.
People do not expect to look at the benefits
they themselves can reap from the charity con
tributions, but rather the good they can do for
society as a whole.
The spring charity drive will continue to be
for the Convalescent Home. This is a tradi
tional affair and need not be considered with
the other charity drives handled by the poll.
Criticism has often been voiced over the
handling of the charity drives. It is very im
portant that the organization conducting the
charity drive each quarter set the goal which
they actually hope to reach. Last fall the SIRO
quota was "puffed" to a point entirely beyond
the students' reach. This appeared to be an at
tempt to make donators feel a need for larger
gifts in order to reach the quota.
The students have a right to expect the quota
to be announced as $6,000 if this is the figure
decided on —and not $12,000.
At the same time, solicitors should not wan
der around the halls of the dormitories and say
"everyone is expected to give $1.50 to this
drive." In order to get into the spirit of a
•charity, the collectors must not put pressure on
the contributors.
It is all right, we think, to announce ahead of
time that in order to reach the anticipated goal
each student will have to give an average of
$1.50 each.
From then on, it is up to the individual bene
factor.
The poll will tell several things. Does the
average student favor charities headed to spe
cial fields, such as relief for education in Eu
rope? Is there as much interest in international
charities as past publicity would make us be
lieve? What is the most satisfactory distribu
tion of funds collected in the fall and winter
charity drives?
The results will be interesting.—G.A.

this fund came $6,000 to help the Stanford
YWCA, the second largest club on campus.
The fall drive exists not for just the UNESCO,
CARE, and World Student Service. The small
national charities such as the Negro College
Fund, the Palo Alto Youth Fund, and the Crip
pled Children's Society, all reserve some part
in the publicity for the fall charity drive.
Next year the drive will be directed by Car
dinals in an effort to get a more well-rounded
drive — not strictly international and not en
tirely local—but one tuned to the pitch estab
lished by Excom's poll.
The winter charity project has been domi
nated in the past by the Red Cross. The Polio
March of Dimes has slowed down to a notice
able extent although it is a very worthy cause.
Other drives have won some support
through mailed requests for individual gifts. It
seems only fair to re-evaluate the winter quar
ter drive to see if there is a student reaction to
redivide the funds among the national chari
ties.
By putting all the charities in one big drive,
Derek Bok and Kay Wold, who are handling the
poll, hope to reduce the nuisance of a charity
drive being conducted every other week.
A poll can only be successful if the students
realize the functions of each charity.
For instance, of the $5,000 quota which goes
to the American Cancer Society from the Palo
Alto-Stanford area, 60 per cent is retained by
the local organizations in Santa Clara County.
Stanford professors in the School of Medi
cine, and the Departments of Biology and
Chemistry have several grants from both the
Cancer and Infantile Paralysis funds for study
ing cures for the diseases.
Cancer funds have been used for cancer edu
cation, cancer clinics, and financial aid to can
cer patients in this area.
The Red Cross life saving instruction, aid to
veteraas' families, and work with the Stanford
Mothers' Club are well-known projects.
The local significance of the charity drives,
however, is not the real reason for student sup
port. It is a much more humanitarian instinct

that leads to success in donations of this kind.
People do not expect to look at the benefits
they themselves can reap from the charity con
tributions, but rather the good they can do for
society as a whole.
The spring charity drive will continue to be
for the Convalescent Home. This is a tradi
tional affair and need not be considered with
the other charity drives handled by the poll.
Criticism has often been voiced over the
handling of the charity drives. It is very im
portant that the organization conducting the
charity drive each quarter set the goal which
they actually hope to reach. Last fall the SIRO
quota was "puffed" to a point entirely beyond
the students' reach. This appeared to be an at
tempt to make donators feel a need for larger
gifts in order to reach the quota.
The students have a right to expect the quota
to be announced as $6,000 if this is the figure
decided on —and not $12,000.
At the same time, solicitors should not wan
der around the halls of the dormitories and say
"everyone is expected to give $1.50 to this
drive." In order to get into the spirit of a
•charity, the collectors must not put pressure on
the contributors.
It is all right, we think, to announce ahead of
time that in order to reach the anticipated goal
each student will have to give an average of
$1.50 each.
From then on, it is up to the individual bene
factor.
The poll will tell several things. Does the
average student favor charities headed to spe
cial fields, such as relief for education in Eu
rope? Is there as much interest in international
charities as past publicity would make us be
lieve? What is the most satisfactory distribu
tion of funds collected in the fall and winter
charity drives?
The results will be interesting.—G.A.
With the last of Stanford's three main charity
drives under the belt for the year, it is time to
analyze their relative importance.
Excom has started the ball rolling by con
ducting a poll of 800 students. Post cards will
be sent out the first of next week for student
evaluation.
The drives listed on the poll will include fled
Cross, Cancer, Infantile Paralysis, small na
tional charities (e.g., Negro College Fund), in
ternational relief for education (e.g., University
of Naples and the Free University of Berlin),
and CARE.
The selection of these national and interna
tional charities seems to fill out the picture
rather well when combined with the local gifts
to the Palo Alto Youth Fund and the Conva
lescent Home.
In the past the fall relief drive pushed by
the lIR has been handled as the SIRO drive.
Although this drive is composed of two parts,
the foreign relief fund and a floating fund, it
has been presented to the campus basically as
international relief.
This is not a fair evaluation of the drive. In
cluded also in the SIRO drive are funds chan
neled to the Palo Alto Youth Fund. Ironically
enough, the 30 per cent quota which went to
this charity amounted to only $1,500. Yet from
this fund came $6,000 to help the Stanford
YWCA, the second largest club on campus.

A poll can only be successful if the students
realize the functions of each charity.
For instance, of the $5,000 quota which goes
to the American Cancer Society from the Palo
Alto-Stanford area, 60 per cent is retained by
the local organizations in Santa Clara County.
Stanford professors in the School of Medi
cine, and the Departments of Biology and
Chemistry have several grants from both the
Cancer and Infantile Paralysis funds for study
ing cures for the diseases.
Cancer funds have been used for cancer edu
cation, cancer clinics, and financial aid to can
cer patients in this area.
The Red Cross life saving instruction, aid to
veteraas' families, and work with the Stanford
Mothers' Club are well-known projects.
The local significance of the charity drives,
however, is not the real reason for student sup
port. It is a much more humanitarian instinct

that leads to success in donations of this kind.
People do not expect to look at the benefits
they themselves can reap from the charity con
tributions, but rather the good they can do for
society as a whole.
The spring charity drive will continue to be
for the Convalescent Home. This is a tradi
tional affair and need not be considered with
the other charity drives handled by the poll.
Criticism has often been voiced over the
handling of the charity drives. It is very im
portant that the organization conducting the
charity drive each quarter set the goal which
they actually hope to reach. Last fall the SIRO
quota was "puffed" to a point entirely beyond
the students' reach. This appeared to be an at
tempt to make donators feel a need for larger
gifts in order to reach the quota.
The students have a right to expect the quota
to be announced as $6,000 if this is the figure
decided on —and not $12,000.
At the same time, solicitors should not wan
der around the halls of the dormitories and say
"everyone is expected to give $1.50 to this
drive." In order to get into the spirit of a
•charity, the collectors must not put pressure on
the contributors.
It is all right, we think, to announce ahead of
time that in order to reach the anticipated goal
each student will have to give an average of
$1.50 each.
From then on, it is up to the individual bene
factor.
The poll will tell several things. Does the
average student favor charities headed to spe
cial fields, such as relief for education in Eu
rope? Is there as much interest in international
charities as past publicity would make us be
lieve? What is the most satisfactory distribu
tion of funds collected in the fall and winter
charity drives?
The results will be interesting.—G.A.
With the last of Stanford's three main charity
drives under the belt for the year, it is time to
analyze their relative importance.
Excom has started the ball rolling by con
ducting a poll of 800 students. Post cards will
be sent out the first of next week for student
evaluation.
The drives listed on the poll will include fled
Cross, Cancer, Infantile Paralysis, small na
tional charities (e.g., Negro College Fund), in
ternational relief for education (e.g., University
of Naples and the Free University of Berlin),
and CARE.
The selection of these national and interna
tional charities seems to fill out the picture
rather well when combined with the local gifts
to the Palo Alto Youth Fund and the Conva
lescent Home.
In the past the fall relief drive pushed by
the lIR has been handled as the SIRO drive.
Although this drive is composed of two parts,
the foreign relief fund and a floating fund, it
has been presented to the campus basically as
international relief.
This is not a fair evaluation of the drive. In
cluded also in the SIRO drive are funds chan
neled to the Palo Alto Youth Fund. Ironically
enough, the 30 per cent quota which went to
this charity amounted to only $1,500. Yet from
this fund came $6,000 to help the Stanford
YWCA, the second largest club on campus.
The fall drive exists not for just the UNESCO,
CARE, and World Student Service. The small
national charities such as the Negro College
Fund, the Palo Alto Youth Fund, and the Crip
pled Children's Society, all reserve some part
in the publicity for the fall charity drive.
Next year the drive will be directed by Car
dinals in an effort to get a more well-rounded
drive — not strictly international and not en
tirely local—but one tuned to the pitch estab
lished by Excom's poll.
The winter charity project has been domi
nated in the past by the Red Cross. The Polio
March of Dimes has slowed down to a notice
able extent although it is a very worthy cause.
Other drives have won some support
through mailed requests for individual gifts. It
seems only fair to re-evaluate the winter quar
ter drive to see if there is a student reaction to
redivide the funds among the national chari
ties.
By putting all the charities in one big drive,
Derek Bok and Kay Wold, who are handling the
poll, hope to reduce the nuisance of a charity
drive being conducted every other week.
