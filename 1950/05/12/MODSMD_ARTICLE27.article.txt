# Leadership Conference
## 
### 
This afternoon and tomorrow Stanford's first
Leadership Conference will be tested as a
means of orienting new student officers into
the workings and problems of student govern
ment.
The conference will also serve as a sound
ing-board for guestions and suggestions from
all students, not necessarily officers.
The speakers chosen to address the Confer
ence are well-gualified to speak on the subject
of student government. Conference-goers will
gain much by hearing the ideas which they
offer.
Ihe Saturday afternoon panel discussions
will cover a number of topics, which should
provide opportunities for hashing out new
ideas on areas for student activities, indepen
dent organizations, and the relationship of stu
dent government to the administration.
Everyone is invited to participate in the
Conference. If enough students forego a trip
to the beach, attend the Conference sessions
and contribute to the discussions, the partici
pants will receive the benefits of extended
knowledge of our student government.
On the other hand, if the Confernce is only
sparsely attended, the result will be little more
than mediocrity.
Student leadership conferences have ac
complished a great deal at other universities.
It remains to be seen whether the same will
hold true at Stanford. We hope so.
