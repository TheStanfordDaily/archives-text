# Truman in Washington ABOARD TRUMAN TRAIN
## 
### 
President Truman took on two
weighty adversaries today â€” the
Senate's filibustering critics of his
civil rights proposals, and former
President Herbert Hoover.
The touring President turned from
a dedication of Grand Coulee Dam
to voice an appeal to Congress to
pass a pending Fair Employment
Practices Commission (FEPC) bill.
The appeal was made in an ad
dress delivered at Gonzaga Univer
sity in Spokane, Wash.
