# 'Each Woman Must Sign Herself Out' Says Lewis
## 
### 
"Every woman living in a campus
residence is responsible for sign
ing out," said Mimi Lewis, Wom
en's Council chairman. Even if a
woman phones in requesting some
one to sign her out, she is still re
sponsible, no matter to whom she
speaks.
Women's Council has reported
several cases in the past few weeks
of girls who thought they were no
longer responsible if they called in
and the night assistant had forgot
to sign them out.
Miss Lewis stated that while girls
have always understood that they
cannot hold a friend responsible,
many have thought that the night
assistant could be held responsible.
Signing girls out is not the night
assistant's job, said Miss Lewis.
Only in the large dormitories do the
girls have the privilege of phoning
her directly.
In small residences run on the
key system, there is no single per
son who can possibly be held re
sponsible for this duty. Thus if the
night assistant were responsible in

the larger dormitories, it would
confer unequal privileges on differ
ent residences.
In order to keep systems uniform
throughout the campus, Women's
Council has stated that every girl
is still responsible for signing her
self out. She will still get an "of
fense" if she is not signed out when
she returns after closing hours.
