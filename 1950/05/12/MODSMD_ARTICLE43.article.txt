# Stanford Cindermen Battle Trojans in Fresno Relays
## 
### 
In the best shape since the start of the season, the Stanford var
sity track team, 26 strong, will journey to the Raisin City, Fresno,
to compete in the first Pacific Coast invitational cinder meet of
th season, the West Coast Relays.
Defending West Coast Relays champion Southern Cal will again

be heavily favored to take the meet,
but Stanford could give the Trojans
quite a battle. Last year, USC didn't
beat a determined Stanford team
until the final event, the pole vault.
McKenley vs. Whitfield
Besides the relay and field events,
Fresno will feature four special
races, the 100, the high hurdles, 5000
meters, and 400 meters. The latter
race will feature the world-record
holder, Herb McKenley, and Ohio
State ace Mai Whitfield.
As usual, the Indians' strong field
corps will pick up many points for
the Indians. Otis Chandler and Lew
Davis are favored to take one-two in
the shot, and Bud Held hopes to re
peat last year's first place in the
javelin.
Gay Bryan, who won the broad
jump and tied for first in the high
jump last year, could be a double
winner in these events, and Don
Campbell may place high in the pole
vault. The field events are scored on
a 5-4-3-2-1 -point basis.
However, it may be the relays that
will decide the meet. The 440, 880,
mile, two-mile, and medley relays
are scored 10-8-6-4-2, and the Cards
will have to overcome a tremendous
USC surplus here.


AL LYONS, improving Card dis
tance runner, may be called on
for double duty in the medley and
two-mile relays for the Indians
in the West Coast Relays to be
held at Fresno tomorrow.
