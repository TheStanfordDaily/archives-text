# Cards, Trojans Scramble For CIBA Pennant Payoff
## Chez, Lovrich Pitching Duel 
### BILL SWIGART 
Followers of West Coast colle
,
giate baseball will focus their at
tention on the University of South
ern California's Bovard Field this
weekend as Stanford's Indians and
USC's Trojans prepare to do or die
in a decisive two-game series that
should decide the CIBA champion
lor 1950 as well as the southern rep
resentative in the Pacific Coast
: Conference playoffs.
This afternoon the conference's
two winningest pitchers, Joe Chez
and Tom Lovrich, will oppose each
other in what may be interpreted as
the most critical of the two contests,
for the winner today will be assured
of at least a tie for the champion
ship and will have an opportunity
to sew the whole thing up come to
morrow.
More Games
Both squads have several confer
j ence games left to play next week,
but both the Cards and the Trojans
figure as strong favorites to win
those games. The series this week
end is "it" for both teams, The blue
chips are down.
It's the climax of the most dra
. matic pennant chase since 1935
when USC and California finished
in a deadlock with 10 won and five
lost. If either team wins both games
then it will undoubtedly be the con
ference winner. If the two teams
split the series then there will be
a playoff at the end of the season.
If they split and then both lose one
or more of their remaining games
then there is a possibility of a three
or four - way playoff with either
Santa Clara or Cal, or both, getting
in on the laurels.
Both the Indinas and the Trojans
are shy of pitchers at the moment,
so after Chez and Lovrich have fin
ished their stints then it's anybody's
guess who will take over the mound
duties tomorrow.
After Chez, Who?
Best bet for Stanford is strong
i armed Jack Heinen, the fast-balling
right-hander, whose fast ball hasn't
been as fast lately, and whose luck
hasn't been as good as it was ear
lier in the year. Heinen has been
blasted off the hill in the early in
nings twice within the past week,
first by Cal last Saturday, and then
by the Santa Clara Broncos on
! Tuesday. Whether he'll be ready to
[ go against USC tomorrow remains
to be seen.
Coach Everett Dean has taken
only five pitchers south with him—
I one being converted outfielder Tony
Stellar who threw the first game of
his life against the Cal JV's last Sat
urday —so if Heinen doesn't last
i then matters are in a seroius state.
| The other hurlers are Jim Claypoo!
and Dave Stott, neither of whom
has shown any propensity to go the
full nine-inning route this year.
But things aren't all roses on the
| other side fo the fence either. Slop
py Jack Schlarb, clowning right
hander, set the San Diego Padres
! down with four hits in the early
part of the year, but then developed
a sore flipper and not much has
s been heard from him since. Coach
Sam Barry has been getting fair
chucking from sophomore Lovrich
| and from Dave Cesca, but the Tro
jans necessarily have won most of
their games at the plate and not on
; the hill.
Stop the Merry-Go-Round
The man whom Chez and his suc
cessor tomorrow must stop most ef
fectively is Jay "Merry-Go" Roun
dy, the bone - crushing footballer,
who is presently head and shoulders
above the rest of the CIBA hitters
with a mark of .424. Dick Clegg
is second in league batting at .379.


Undefeated Stanford pitcher JOE CHEZ will get the starting nod
in today's crucial CIBA battle with second-place USC in Los
Angeles. The Cards, who are leading the league by one-half a
game, play the Trojans in a second all-important game at Bo
vard Field tomorrow.
