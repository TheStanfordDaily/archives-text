# Netmen Travel South Without Barbour; Meet USC and UCLA
## 
### 
The varsity tennis squad, deter
mined but without much chance,
leaves for Los Angeles this morn
ing for a two-game series with USC
and UCLA.
Both the Bruins and the Trojans
are powerful and loaded with na
tionally ranked stars. Both own
lopsided wins over the Indians ear
lier this season, and should be
tougher on their home courts.
Besides, when the locals take tc
the USC courts this afternoon, Lu
cien Barbour will be missing from
the lineup. Barbour is unable to
make the trip for undisclosed ad
ministrative reasons.
His loss is not as serious as it
could be. since Barbour is at the
bottom of a bad slump in his net
game. Earlier this week, Ernie Du-
Bray toppled Barbour in a chal
lenge ladder match for the second
singles position. Also on Tuesday
George Gentry easily put away Tom
Lewyn who was challenging for a
higher spot in the varsity in straight
sets.
The six-man squad will leave on
the 9:30 a.m. plane, and will arrive
in L.A. in time to limber up before
the singles matches. Tomorrow the
Indians play in Westwood. The

matches will be televised to South
ern California audiences.
Men making the trip in order of
play are Kirke Mechem, Ernie Du-
Bray, George Gentry, Tom Lewyn,
Vince Schmeider, and Dean Brink
man. Doubles pairings are Mechem-
Lewyn, Du√üray - Brinkman, and
Gentry-Sehmieder.
