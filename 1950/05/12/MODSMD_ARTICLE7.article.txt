# Rail Strike Hits Lines, Industries
## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 11 (/P)—The na
' tion's biggest rail strike in four
I years clamped a quick squeeze on
| the nation's employment and indus
try today.
Unemployment pyramided swiftly
on the railroads and in the coal
mines and many industrial concerns
reported they would be hit in a
matter of days.
There was violence but no peace
moves.
The dispute was deadlocked so
completely that the National (Rail
way) Mediation Board was simply
standing by, available for consulta
tion if either side wants them.
Layoff Expected
The Pennsylvania Railroad said
it would lay off 80,000 of its 125,000
employees by tomorrow morning.
The New York Central said 25,-
j 000 of its workers already arc idle
and that 15,000 more non-operating
employees will be laid off by to
morrow or Monday.
The Santa Fe ordered its shops
closed, affecting several thousand
workers. The exact figures were
not given.
The Southern Railway System
said most of its 38,000 employees
would be idle by tomorrow night.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen and Enginemen called a
strike against these lines yesterday
to support its demands for an extra
fireman on certain diesel locomo
tives. About 18,000 firemen walked
out.
Output Dwindles
The strike has knocked out 12 per
cent of western Pennsylvania's coal
output so far. Fourteen big mines
and several small mines with an
estimated combined daily output of
35,000 tons shut down because there
were no empty cars to carry away
the mined coal. The number of idle
Pennsylvania miners may rise to
55,000 next week.
The strikebound Pennsylvania
Railroad serves about 25 per cent
of the western Pennsylvania mines.
Detroit's automobile industry has
not yet been affected, but most
manufacturers say some trouble is
likely if the strike lasts more than
a week. Chrysler Corp., just back
in production after a 100-day strike,
said it might have to curtail opera
tions sharply next week.
No Conferences Planned
Members of the National Media
tion Board arc planning to remain
i in Chicago several days, but have
scheduled no conferences with the
disputants. The board gave up the
j peacc struggle as "hopeless," a few
1 hours after the strike started.
However, the board announced,
after conferring with John R.
Steclman, Presidential assistant, in
Washington, that it would be avail
able for consultation by either side.

employees will be laid off by to
morrow or Monday.
The Santa Fe ordered its shops
closed, affecting several thousand
workers. The exact figures were
not given.
The Southern Railway System
said most of its 38,000 employees
would be idle by tomorrow night.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen and Enginemen called a
strike against these lines yesterday
to support its demands for an extra
fireman on certain diesel locomo
tives. About 18,000 firemen walked
out.
Output Dwindles
The strike has knocked out 12 per
cent of western Pennsylvania's coal
output so far. Fourteen big mines
and several small mines with an
estimated combined daily output of
35,000 tons shut down because there
were no empty cars to carry away
the mined coal. The number of idle
Pennsylvania miners may rise to
55,000 next week.
The strikebound Pennsylvania
Railroad serves about 25 per cent
of the western Pennsylvania mines.
Detroit's automobile industry has
not yet been affected, but most
manufacturers say some trouble is
likely if the strike lasts more than
a week. Chrysler Corp., just back
in production after a 100-day strike,
said it might have to curtail opera
tions sharply next week.
No Conferences Planned
Members of the National Media
tion Board arc planning to remain
i in Chicago several days, but have
scheduled no conferences with the
disputants. The board gave up the
j peacc struggle as "hopeless," a few
1 hours after the strike started.
However, the board announced,
after conferring with John R.
Steclman, Presidential assistant, in
Washington, that it would be avail
able for consultation by either side.
CHICAGO, May 11 (/P)—The na
' tion's biggest rail strike in four
I years clamped a quick squeeze on
| the nation's employment and indus
try today.
Unemployment pyramided swiftly
on the railroads and in the coal
mines and many industrial concerns
reported they would be hit in a
matter of days.
There was violence but no peace
moves.
The dispute was deadlocked so
completely that the National (Rail
way) Mediation Board was simply
standing by, available for consulta
tion if either side wants them.
Layoff Expected
The Pennsylvania Railroad said
it would lay off 80,000 of its 125,000
employees by tomorrow morning.
The New York Central said 25,-
j 000 of its workers already arc idle
and that 15,000 more non-operating
employees will be laid off by to
morrow or Monday.
