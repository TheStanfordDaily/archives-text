# Organized Crime in California,' Says Howser at Campus Appearance
## 
### 
There's no organized crime in
California.
Attorney General Frederick Na
poleon Howser testified to this fact
when he visited the campus on a
campaign tour Friday afternoon.
For proof, he said, ask the sheriffs
of Califronia. Fifty out of 58 will
substantiate the statement, accord
ing to Howser—the other eight are
mixed up in politics.
Howser arrived at the Cellar at
4:30 Friday afternoon in a caravan
of three Cadillac convertibles. Find
ing few voters in sight, he headed
for Rossotti's, where the crowd was.
Speaking for his own rc-election
before 200 students, Howser chal
lenged his audience to look at the
record. Asked about the Olney
Crime Commission, Howser said
thai the Governor's special com
mitter had printed a lot of articles
and statements, "but had failed to
present any true facts."
Asked about gambling in Califor
nia, the Attorney General said the
state had "one of the most vicious
forms of gambling, and that's horse
racing."
"But," he said, "as long as horse
racing is legal we might as well per
mit bookies to operate and see that
their activities are regulated and
the proper percentage of their take
is channeled to the state.
As for slot machines, Howser fig
ured they didn't violate the spirit
of the law if they were operated in
a club or fraternal organization, but
he didn't want to see them in "every
corner drug store." Roulette and
craps are out, as far as the state's

number one law enforcement officer
is concerned.
Houser spoke through a loud
speaker to his audience for about 15

minutes, then answered personal
questions directed to him while his
cohorts rolled out a barrel of free
beer for the voters.
