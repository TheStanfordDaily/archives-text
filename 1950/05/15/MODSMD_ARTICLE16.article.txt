Leadership—its principles and its problems—was thoroughly
dissected Friday and Saturday when Stanford students gathered
in the Education Building for the Farm's first Student Leadership
Conference.

"It was unanimously agreed
thing, that everyone got a good deal
out of it, and that it should be con
tinued," said Donn Wells, co-chair
man of the event.
Education Is Life
Speaking in the first plenary ses
sion Friday afternoon, Clarence H.
Faust, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, attacked the "half-truth" that
maintains the "separation of educa
tion from life." Campus life is a real
as any other, he declared. As a con
sequence, he said, campus leadership
is as serious as leadership anywhere.
It gives more than mere prestige.
"Student government is not a right
but a privilege, carrying responsi
bilities to the academic community,"

Speaking on "Student Government,
at Stanford," Lawrence A. Kimpton,
Dean of Students, placed the origins
of student government in the old
European system of education, where
students were forced to band to
gether to aid each other.
"This is our university," he said.
"Students, faculty, and administra
tion are united in a common task."
A fundamental objective of student
government is a realization of the
meaning of responsibility and au
thority, he said, and this comes from
participation in student activities.
Carl Stover, participant in the Na
tional Student Association, spoke on

cedure." Saturday morning Helen
Schrader, assistant professor of

of students in a socio-drama explain

ASSU Student Manager John Lil
ienthal talked on "Financing the Stu

Fundamental Standard, and Honor
Code, and interrelation of student
organizations. Discussion leaders in
