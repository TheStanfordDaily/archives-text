# Floods in Canada, U.S.

### 
Winnipeg residents prepared for
the worst Sunday, and hoped it
wouldn't come. Additional thou
sands left their suburban homes in
the areas menaced by rising Red
River backwaters.
The swollen Red and its tributa
ries spread over 540 square miles
of southern Manitoba, six square
miles in Greater Winnipeg. An es
timated 63,000 of the Winnipeg
area's 350,000 population have been
displaced. The total was expected
to reach 70,000.
