# Ruling Upsets Fresno Outcome
## 'Unprecedented' Decision Gives USC Eight-Point Win Over Cards 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
By virtue of an unprecedented ruling which gave a disqualified
USC relay team 8 points, Stanford again succumbed to Troy's
mighty track horde in the Fresno Relays Saturday. The official
score was USC 75 1-3, Stanford 67 1-2.
The trouble all started when Jim Pruett, anchor man of Southern

Cat's crack two-mile relay team, ac-"
cidentally tripped UCLA's Jack Mil
ler, who was leading by a fraction
of a yard around the final turn of
the race.
Normally, Pruett's action would
call for the team's complete disquali
fication and the 14,000 West Coast
Relay fans sensed a Stanford upset.
But the relay judges didn't see it that
way.
Amos Alonzo Stagg, referee of the
meet, ruled that since both the Stan
ford and California teams were so
far behind, the incident had no bear
ing on anything but the first two
places. Many persons wondered how
the ruling would affect similar inci
dents in the future.
Buck Surprises
The biggest surprise of the relays,
excluding Trojan Dick Attlesey's
new world record of 13.5 in the high
hurdles, was Ronnie Buck's tre
mendous effort in the open 100-yard
dash.
The red hot Stanford sprinter was
leading the pack for over 75 yards,
only to be edged by sprint aces Don
nie Anderson and Lloyd Laßeach
near the finish. Anderson won in 9.5,
Laßeach was second, and Buck, who
was unofficially clocked at a shade
over 9.6, a close third.
Buck's third place gave Stanford an
unexpected 3 points in this event,
and it gave Gay Bryan a chance to
rest for the relay races and jumps.
410 Relay Team Wins
Stanford's 440 relay team, com
posed of Ronnie Buck, Wilbur Tay
lor, Bob Bryan, and Gay Bryan,
pulled away from USC to win by 5
yards.
But the Trojans turned the tables
in the 880 relay, despite a great an
chor furlong by Gay Bryan, who
made more than 3 yards on Troy's
speed sprinter John Bradley.
In the mile relay, the Stanford
team, composed of Cass Bly, Wilbur
Taylor, Pitch Johnson, and Gay
Bryan, ran its fastest time of the
year, an unofficial 3:16.0, but had to
be satisfied with second place. Occi
dental, with Bill Parker anchoring,
won the event in 3:15.4, San Jose
State third, and USC fourth.
The intercollegiate broad jump
lead changed hands several times be
tween Denver's ace Jerome Biffie and
Bryan. Biffle finally came out on top
with a mighty leap of 25 ft. 7 in., and
Bryan took second with a very re
spectable 25 ft. 1 3 /t in. He went un
placed in the high jump.
Biggest disappointment was Stan
ford javelin thrower Bud Held, who
was defeated for the first time this
year. Cy Young of UCLA took first
with a 216 ft. 3 J /fe in. toss, and Delf
Pickarts of Cal at Santa Barbara,
placed second at 215 ft. 9V2 in. Hcld's
last throw, which removed him from
the 201-foot bracket, traveled 214 ft.
3V4 in.
Chandler Gains Revenge
Otis Chandler gained revenge in
the shot put over LAAC's Moose
Thompson, who defeated the Card
star in the Fresno Relays last year.
Chandler heaved the shot 54 ft. lOVfe
in., which failed by inches of setting a
new West Coast Relays record. Lew
Davis, Chuck Hokanson, and Norm
Nourse took two, three, four in the
collegiate scoring.
Bob Mathias, who went unplaced in
the high hurdles, set a new personal
discus record with a 157 ft. s>/4 in.
throw. Frank Bradley of the Indians
also recorded a best-ever, when he
heaved the platter 149 ft. 6% in to
grab second piacc in the college com
petition. Taylor Lewis, former UCLA
star, won the event at 164 ft. '•> in.
Campbell Gets Second
Don Campbell of the Cards cleared
the pole vault bar at 13 ft. 6 in. for a
second-place tie in the collegiate
scoring. George Mattos of San Jose
State, scored five points for the Spar
tans with his 11 ft. effort.
George Montgomery, competing
for LAAC, won the even! at 14 ft.
4 in. Bob Richards of Illinois, who
cleared 14 ft. llVfe in. a few weeks
ago, vaulted a disappointing 14 ft.
Stanford's two-mile relay team
(Bud Cohen, Woody Bray, AI Lyons,
and Joss Scroggy) placed fourth and
the Indians' medley relay team (Stan
Dawson, Bray, John Woolley, and
Lyons), took fifth.


808 BRYAN, Stanford's other Bryan, came through in great
style at the Fresno Relays Saturday night as he, Ronnie Buck,
Wilbur Taylor, and brother Gay won the 440-yard relay, edging
out USC by five yards. Winning time was :41.0.
