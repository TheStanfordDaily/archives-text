# RAIL STRIKE
## No Settlement Seen in 5-Day Work Cutback 
### 
CHICAGO, May 14 (/P)—A federal
mediator said tonight that prospects
for early settlement of the five-day
old rail strike "don't look too hot."
Leverett Edwards, a member of the
National (Railway) Mediation Board,
made the remark after a five-hour
conference with firemen's represen
tatives and railroad officials. The
mediators held separate sessions with
each side.
The strike of 18,000 firemen affects
five of the nation's major rail sys
tems. It began Wednesday.
"It doesn't look like there will be
a break tonight," said Edwards.
"We're all worn out."
Asked if he had scheduled peace
talks for tomorrow, Edwards replied:
"We haven't any talks planned yet,
but I hope there will be some."
Two, instead of the usual four,
Union Pacific trains left today on
Eastern runs following the walkoff of
firemen on the Los Angeles-Salt
Lake City leg.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen and Enginemen pulled out
Union Pacific firemen because, it
contended, the company has been
helping the struck Santa Fe lines to
keep operating.
At Atlanta, Ga., L. B. Johnson,
Southern general chairman fo the
firemen, claimed that every impor
tant sector of the 8,000-mile Southern
Railway System has been tied up 01
crippled by the walkout of 1,200 more
firemen and enginemen.
Johnson estimated that 2,400 men
in 14 divisions of the Southern sys
tem are now on strike. He said
Southern operations in strategic
areas are "practically shut down."
Meanwhile, effects of the strike
sharpened. The New York Central
Lines said an additional 10,000 em
ployees would be furloughed tomor
row, raising the total of those laid
off to 50,000.
