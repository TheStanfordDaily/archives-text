## Plays and Playwrights 
### 
A young friend of mine once had a great ambition
to become a playwright. He spent many months work
ing on iiis first play. When it was completed, he
handed it to me and asked for my opinion. I'm afraid
I was rather harsh with him. There wasn't a single
thing I found right with his play. Everything was
wrong. For one thing, his play was too much like real
life, and that's enough to condemn any play.
For his own good, I proceeded to dissuade him from
his mad ambition. I criticized everything there was to
criticize and more. Finally, much discouraged and a
little hurt, he said: "Since yo\j seem to know so much
about what a play should not be like, why don't you
write a play of your own?" I was greatly flattered, of
course, but 1 assured him that he would never find
me as the author of any play.
Now, it seems to me, there are only two types of
people who write plays—those who want to get rich,
and those who can't help it. As for myself, 1 want to
get rich. I've known too many rich people. Further
more, I've never had the overpowering urge to write
a play.
But apart from not having the desire to write a play,
I also lack the necessary qualities of a playwright.
Many playwrights have to write with their tongues in

their cheek. My cheek is in my tongue. Those who
depend on their plays to make a living have to write to
please the public, or else they starve to death. I don't
want to please anybody, except myself, and what
pleases me seldom pleases the public.
For example, 1 mny want to write a play about
giraffes and insist that the parts be acted by giraffes.
The acting probably will not suffer much, but no one
will want to see my play simply because giraffes never
say anything.
Or perhaps, I may want to write a play about gram
marians. I'll want them to use atrocious grammar,
and say a different thing every night. The public just
won't tolerate such things, and, if I were writing plays
for a living, I would soon cease to live.
There are yet other difficulties which playwrights
must overcome. When they think of anything original,
they have to stretch it into full-length plays. I can
rarely think of anything original, and even when I do,
1 can only say it in a sentence, or maybe a paragraph.
I can never expand it into four acts.
Therefore, the probabilities are that I wiil never be
come a playwright. But just to be sure of keeping my
promise to my friend, however, I have told all my
other friends to strangle me the moment they find me
writing a play.

A young friend of mine once had a great ambition
to become a playwright. He spent many months work
ing on iiis first play. When it was completed, he
handed it to me and asked for my opinion. I'm afraid
I was rather harsh with him. There wasn't a single
thing I found right with his play. Everything was
wrong. For one thing, his play was too much like real
life, and that's enough to condemn any play.
For his own good, I proceeded to dissuade him from
his mad ambition. I criticized everything there was to
criticize and more. Finally, much discouraged and a
little hurt, he said: "Since yo\j seem to know so much
about what a play should not be like, why don't you
write a play of your own?" I was greatly flattered, of
course, but 1 assured him that he would never find
me as the author of any play.
Now, it seems to me, there are only two types of
people who write plays—those who want to get rich,
and those who can't help it. As for myself, 1 want to
get rich. I've known too many rich people. Further
more, I've never had the overpowering urge to write
a play.
But apart from not having the desire to write a play,
I also lack the necessary qualities of a playwright.
Many playwrights have to write with their tongues in

their cheek. My cheek is in my tongue. Those who
depend on their plays to make a living have to write to
please the public, or else they starve to death. I don't
want to please anybody, except myself, and what
pleases me seldom pleases the public.
For example, 1 mny want to write a play about
giraffes and insist that the parts be acted by giraffes.
The acting probably will not suffer much, but no one
will want to see my play simply because giraffes never
say anything.
Or perhaps, I may want to write a play about gram
marians. I'll want them to use atrocious grammar,
and say a different thing every night. The public just
won't tolerate such things, and, if I were writing plays
for a living, I would soon cease to live.
There are yet other difficulties which playwrights
must overcome. When they think of anything original,
they have to stretch it into full-length plays. I can
rarely think of anything original, and even when I do,
1 can only say it in a sentence, or maybe a paragraph.
I can never expand it into four acts.
Therefore, the probabilities are that I wiil never be
come a playwright. But just to be sure of keeping my
promise to my friend, however, I have told all my
other friends to strangle me the moment they find me
writing a play.
