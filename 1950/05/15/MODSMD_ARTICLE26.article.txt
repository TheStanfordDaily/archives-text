## That Word on the Boathouse 
### 
To the Editor:
Twice in the last month, most recently on the front
page of the fashion edition, you published pictures
of a boathouse situated on the shores of Stanford's
Lake Lagunita. As we considered this structure, mem
ories of its every splinter surged within us. But alas!
The springtime nostalgia which generally climaxes
such perusal has for us been dispelled by gnawing
doubt: surely this cannot be part of the Stanford we
knew! Slowly our fever of spring has given way to
one of impassioned fury!
By what real or envisioned horror are we assailed
in our vicarious recapture of the seasonal lassitude
we once knew? To what insidious influence must we
lay this attempt at severance of our springtime reve
ries of Stanford?
Sir, there is a dirty three-letter word smeared on
the Boathouse!
Is it not enough that Stanford once tasted defeat at
the hands of the barbarians whose mark is here af
fixed? Fortunes in more recent endeavors give us
reason no longer to languish, but rather to cheer the

Cardinal! Must such graphic mockery of vandals re
main before us when time has sundered the myth of
their superiority? No longer should you suffer—nay,
flaunt—this obscenity before all who would see. The
bear has been humbled.
Let John Hall pause in his efforts to open the
Hoover Tower on Sundays. Let him take up this good
fight on behalf of us all: to rid the Boathouse of the
offensive scrawlings of unlettered urchins! Let every
member of Rally Ccm be given a scrub brush, to this
end: that future generations at Stanford not be sick
ened by overt reminders of those who write on Boat
house walls!

(Editor's Note.—The Whitakers may receive some
consolation in the fact that when the well-used pic
ture of the Boathouse appeared in the Daily Cali
fornian in connection with the UC-Stanford frosh
day here, that "dirty" three-letter word was missing.
Our photographer, mindful of the had publicity
Stanford might have received, whitewashed it out
on the picture.)
