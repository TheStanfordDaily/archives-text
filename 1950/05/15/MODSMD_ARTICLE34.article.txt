# Farm Market to We Surveyed
## 
### 
The Stanford market will be the
subject of a sales potential survey
beginning today.
Alpha Delta Sigma, national pro
fessional advertising fraternity, is
conducting a survey of the sales po
tential of the Stanford market with
special reference to the place of cam
pus publications in the sales ap
proach of potential advertisers.
Under the guidance of Professor
H. L. Churchill, market research
expert now with the Stanford Insti
tute for Journalistic Studies, inter
viewers will contact "a perfect ran
dom sample" of Farm students for
the needed information.
Jack Little, president of the Stan

ford chapter of Alpha Delta Sigma,
urged that all persons contacted ex
tend their fullest co-operation in the
completion of the questionnaires.
"Without a complete sample, the
survey is worthless. A very small
number of incomplete or unreliable
answers could introduce sufficient
error to render the sample useless,"
Little said.
