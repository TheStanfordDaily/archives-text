# Spring Show Players In Trojan War Rehearsal
## 
### 
Greeks and Trojans, Helen and
Paris, and the Oracle of Delphi tan
gle nightly at the Memorial Audi
torium as the Spring Show swings
into its final week of dress rehear
sals. The show, entitled "Who Calls
It War!" will open Thursday at 8:15
and run through Saturday.
Tickets are on sale at the ASSU
office, Engineering corner, and Me
morial Auditorium box office for
$1.15, 85 cents, and 55 cents apiece.
The production is a musical farce
satirizing the Trojan War. In this
version, the entire war was nothing
but a hoax played for laughs by
Agamemnon (Frank Wolff) and the
Oracle of Delphi (Tom Shipp), a
mythologcial con man.
Paris, played by Dick Jones, kid
napped Helen merely as a joke
when he really wanted to marry
somebody else. King Priam (Bill
Harley) is completely intimidated
by his domineering wife, Hecuba
(Kay Lloyd), who really runs things
in the Trojan household. Ginger
McFadden plays Helen, Don Camp
bell, Menelaus, and Oinone, Paris'
sweetheart, is played by Janie Al
len.
The book for this year's Spring
Show was written by Norman Wex
ler and Bill Dailey. Wexler also
wrote the lyrics, for which Mort
Zieve, director of the show, com
posed the music. Broadcast Music
Inc. is publishing the music from

the show, which will he sold at in
termissions.
Profits from this year's produc
tion will be dnoated to the Stan
ford Convalescent Home for the
first time in several years.
Assisting Zieve in directing the
show are Nick Gilroy and Bill Ken
ny. Technical direction is by Dick
Hay, music and orchestration by
Bill Barnes, choreography by Dixie
Black, and costumes by Marilyn
Rabinovitch. Dick Casler, stage
manager, also designed the sets. Kay
Lloyd is production co-ordinator.
