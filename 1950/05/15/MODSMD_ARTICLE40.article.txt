# Stanford Divides with Trojans
## Cards Return With Half-Game Margin As CIBA Baseball Enters Home Stretch 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's baseball warriors re
turned from Los Angeles last night
.still hanging on to a slim half-game
lead over "JSC as the CIBA race
moves into its final week. The
("aids split their crucial two-game
series with USC over the weekend,
l iking a tight sto 4 decision'in Fri
day's game and bowing 15 to 3 in
Saturday's final.
Stanford has two games remain
ing with St. Mary's. The first game
will be on the Sunken Diamond
tomorrow, and the final game of the
season is scheduled for Moraga Sat
urday. The Trojans still have three
games remaining on the slate. They
meet UCLA Tuesday at USC and
travel north to play St. Mary's Fri
day and Cal Saturday.
If both teams win their remaining
games, it will necessitate a sudden
death play-off to determine who
will represent the CIBA in the re
gional play-offs with the champions
of the Northern Division.
Indians Break "Lefty" Jinx
In Friday's game, which was
packed with more excitement,
drama, and action than a six-reel
Western, the Indians finally broke
the "lefty" jinx that had been
plaguing them all season. The win
over the Trojans' ace southpaw,
Dave Cesca, is the first league vic
tory over a portsider that the In
dians have chalked up this season.
With the pressure on, and the
game riding on practically every
pitch, the Cards turned in a mag
nificent performance. Joe Chez, the
Indians' brilliant sophomore chuck
er, chalked up his sixth straight
CIBA win without a loss. Chez ap
peared to be tougher on the Tro
jans when they had men on base.
He struck the league's leading hit
ter, Jay Roundy, twice for the third
out when the Trojans were on the
base paths.
Stanford scored first in the third
frame as Charlie Cole tripled to
deep left center field,and Dave Mel
ton followed with a home-run smash
over the left field barrier. The
Cards stretched their lead to 3 to 0
in the fifth when Bruce Cameron
drew a base on balls, went to third
on Cole's double, and came home
after Melton had flied deep to right.
The Indians were still threaten
ing in the fifth after two were down
with Cole on third and Bud Klein
on second. Cesca fired to third, at
tempting to pick Cole off. Cole slid
in under the tag, but the umpire,
whose view of the play was cut off
by USC's third baseman, A 1 Karan,
called Cole out. In the beef that
followed, Melton, who had driven
in all three of the Cards' runs, was
thumbed out of the game.
USC cut the Indians' lead to one
run in their half of the fifth when
they scored twice on two doubles
and a gingle.
Deciding Runs Scored in Seventh
Stanford scored the deciding runs
in the seventh canto as Chez sin
gled, Cole walked, and Klein drove
a double into deep left field to
score them.
Troy scored once again in the
eighth to bring the score to 5 to 3
going into the ninth inning.
First man up for USC, Serge
Freeman, struck out, but Bob Lillis
bunted down the third base line
and beat it out for an infield single.
Rudy Regalado followed with a sin
pie, and Al Lamont drove a sharp
; ingle into left field to score Lillis
and chase Regalado to third.
With the tying run on third and
the winning run on first, Everett
Dean called on the old "fireman,"
Dave Stott. Stott, who had saved
three games already this season,
came through once again.
Many Errors Saturday
In Saturday's game it was hard
to find much resemblance to the
come-through Stanford team of the
day before. In addition to the five
errors that were chalked up to the
Indians in the score book, there
were mental errors, too numerous
to mention.
USC pushed across two runs in
the first frame off Stanford starting
hurler Jack Heinen as he walked
the first two men up and served up
a two-base hit to Al Lamont.
With the score 5 to 0 in the fifth
stanza, USC scored five unearned
runs to build up a 10 to 0 lead.
After USC's starting chucker,
Jack Schlarb, had tossed five hitless
innings, Cole led off the sixth with
a home run over the right field
fence, and Klein followed with a
triple. Melton connected for his sec
ond circuit clout of the series to
score Klein ahead of him, and that
ended Stanford's scoring for the
• lay.
