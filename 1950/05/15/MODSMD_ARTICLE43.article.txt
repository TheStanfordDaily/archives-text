## Gridders Run Wild In Pigskin Preview 
### AL BERRY 
Coach Marchie Schwartz's 1950
grid charges put on a combination
football, basketball, and track meet
in the Stadium Saturday, as quar
terback Dick Horn's whiteshirted
warriors out-blocked, out-dribbled,
and outraccd a determined bunch
ot boys in red by the undecisiveness
of an al'terpoint, 48-47.
But the score, as always in the
spring, is immaterial. The impor
tant thing is that both teams were
blocking well, running well, and
passing magnificently. And, as is to
be expected when you tab 95 points
in 60 minutes of play, there were
not one but many game heroes. One
of the foremost of these was Red
quarterback Jack Bickel, who got
the nod over the injured Gary Ker
korian in directing the destinies of
the Redmen.
Bickel Brilliant
Bickel had a day for himself, sec
ond only to the well-seasoned Horn.
He handled his team well, passed
for one tally, and set up two more
by long, brilliant passes to his for
mer junior varsity teammate end
Bob Scott.
But even the fine work of Bickel
had to take a back seat to the not
unexpected qbing of Dick Horn.
Horn's tossing, in what was essen
tially a passing game, was superla
tive and netted three touchdowns.
His signal calling and faking were
excellent. And his afterpoint kick
ing—6 for 7 with one blocked—
made old hands nearly forget '47
and '48.
Boyd Benson, the Kmetovic-like
speedster from Seattle, Washington,
was the day's top infantryman, as he
dashed for two touchdowns — one
for 28 yards and another for 42
yards. In between the two markers,
the green-panted dancer carried the
major share of the Whites' land at
tack.
Another old hand, Eric South
wood, also had a day for himself
as he scored twice, and blocked like
an old trouper.
St. Geme Another Andrews
The small gold cup for the day's
most sensational dashes goes with
out dispute to last season's frosh
quarterback, Joe St. Geme, now a
i halfback with speed. St. Geme
I nailed the Reds' fourth touchdown
with a spectacular 90-yard sprint
and wound up his spring game ap
pearance with an 85-yard run for
the game's final bingo. St. Geme, a
440 man in track, looked very much
like he might be an ample replace
ment for "Eight-yard" Rupe An
drews in the spot touchdown de
partment.
The Cards didn't devote much
time to defense this spring, and the
! game showed it. But not all the
i touchdowns were the result of
naught in the play-stopping depart

ment. The passing was brilliant, the
blocking was the best that spring
time warriors have managed since
the war, and the backs lived up to
their pre-game notices of being ter
rific.
