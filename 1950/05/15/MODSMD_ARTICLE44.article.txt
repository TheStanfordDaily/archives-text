Varsity and frosh swimming
teams from Stanford won a twin
bill from Cal Saturday at Berkeley,
in weather that can only be de
scribed as "foul."
Both teams won by the score of
50 to 25, exactly doubling their op
ponents' total.
Top performance was by the frosh
medley relay team of Bert Holiday,
Dayr Peterman, and Mel Smith,
which set a new Cal-Stanford frosh
record of 3:07.0 for the 300-yard
race, taking six seconds off the old
record. The weather, foggy with
a chill wind, ruined the frosh free
style relay team's chances of crack
ing that mark, because the quartet
of Al Marsh, George Mowut, Holi
day, and Smith were unable to come
close to their best times after an
hour and a half of shivering in the
cold.
Best race in the varsity meet was
the 50 freestyle, where Bob Wycoff,
red - headed soph sprinter, muffed
his start and missed his turn, but
came roaring back to lose by a
touch-out to Cal's Don Fisher.
