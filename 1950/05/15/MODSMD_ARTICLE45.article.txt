# Card Oarsmen Swamp USC
## 
### BILL WOOD 
Stanford's varsity crew chalked
up an easy victory over the USC
oarsmen Saturday morning on a
choppy 2,000-meter course at the
Palo Alto Yacht Harbor. Leading
all the way, the Cards coasted past
the finish line at a 24-stroke snail's
pace with their rivals three lengths
behind. The winning time was 0:47.
Mishaps seemed to be the order of
the day as first the races were de
layed by mechanical difficulties on
both of the Indian launches and
then SC was forced to forfeit the
junior varsity race when their shell
was swamped by the bay's rough
waters.
In spite of the difficult rowing
conditions, Stanford's varsity crew
had little difficulty in overcoming
their southland opponents. Jumping
oft to a quick lead at the start with
a 38-stroke beat, the Card oarbend
ers virtually coasted to victory after
crossing the half-way mark despite
the Trojans' valiant efforts to over
take them.
Following the contest, Stanford
stroke Jim Filer, representing his
teammates, was awarded the prize
of Saturday's game, the Roxy Tro
phy. The presentation was made by
the referee, Col. Frank Adams.
