## Frosh Lose To Cal Bearcubs 
### 
Stanford frosh baseball team's
win streak came to a rude and
abrupt end, as Cal's frosh clubbed
the Papooses, 8 to 3. at Berkeley on
Saturday.
The Cardbabes were seeking
(heir seventh straight win, and a
victory in the three-game Cal se
ries, but instead received their first
setback since the initial Cal game,
April 17.
Bob Murphy, who had hurled a
one-hitter against Cal last week,
wasn't up to form as he was bat
tered around for 13 hits.
Alter the first three inn:ngs, there
was little doubt that Cal would take
the rubber game of the three-game
series. The Bear Cubs reached Mur
phy for three runs in the first and
one more in the third for a 4 to 0
cushion.
Stanford tried to take sorfie of the
stuffing out of the cushion in the
fourth as left-fielder Gene Shirley
walked and stole second. He ad
vanced to third on shortstop Dick
Cole's infield out and countered on
catcher Jack Shepard's hard-hit fly
to center.
Cal put the game on ice in the
fifth as A 1 Mathews singled, Jim
Bandy drew a walk, and all came
scurrying home behind pitcher Ed
Mayer's home run.
