# Unemployment Rises in State
## 
### 
Unemployment in California is
still increasing, but at a lesser rate
than a year ago, according to a re
cent survey by the California 'Stale
Department of Employment.
Agriculture, forestry, fishing,
manufacturing, construction, trade,
federal, utilities, and service occu
pations all suffered losses in em
ployment. There has also been a
large number of unemployment
claims from workers in such manu
facturing industries as apparel, ma
chinery, furniture, and stone, clay,
and glass products.
The department predicts an early
rise in seasonal food processing and
lumbering, steady employment for
aircraft trades, and an upturn in
construction work.
