# Begum Liaquat Will Speak Here Tonight
## Wife of Pakistan Minister Noted For Outstanding Record of Social Service 
### 
Begum Liaquat Ali Khan, the wife of the Prime Minister of Paki
stan, will arrive at Stanford tomorrow. After dining with Mrs.
Sterling, the Begum (pronounced Bay-Gum) will hold a press con
ference at 8:15. She will speak at 8:30 at the Hoover Library.
The Begum was born in Almora, a hill station in India,

receiving her B.A. degree in 1927,
she attended Lucknow University,
where she was the only female stu
dent in her class. At Lucknow, her
Master's thesis was acknowledged
the best of the year. She completed
her formal education by taking a
teacher's training course at the Uni
versity of Calcutta.
After teaching high school for some
time, the Begum in 1931 became a
Professor of Economics at Indra
prastha College in Delhi.
In April 1933, she married Mr.
Khan, and now has two children,
Ashraf 12, and Abkar 8. Besides
looking after her children, the Be
gum finds time to serve as a mem
ber of the Karachi Education Inquiry
Committee, an organization which
considers child welfare problems.
The wife of the Prime Minister has
inspired the formation of many con
temporary Pakistanian women's
groups.
Among others, she has organized
the Pakistan Women's Voluntary
Service, occasioned by the cholera
epidemic in 1947. In this project, the
Begum was called upon to make a
nation-wide appeal for Muslim girls
of a good family. To be successful,
she had to wage an eventually-suc
cessful fight against old prejudices
and customs.
Later the Begum helped to form
the Pakistan Women's National
Guard, of which she is now the Chief
Comptroller with the rank of briga
dier. This organization is a volun
tary service under military control.
The girls are required to do parade
and foot-drill, nursing, typing, and
signalling work.
Not the least of the Begum's many
responsibilities is her position as
president of the Pakistan Cottage In
dustries Association. This was or
ganized in March 1948 to revive and
develop cottage industries, provide
steady and fair employment for the
millions of refugees. All capital is
provided voluntarily and the profits
are devoted to charity.
