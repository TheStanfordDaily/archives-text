The conccpts of Communism will
never survive in Pakistan, Begum
Liaquat Ali Khan said last night
in her talk at Hoover Libc.
The Begum said that India is the
only country with which Pakistan
is not maintaining cordial relations.
Both India and Pakistan are
awaiting the UN's decision on the
allocation of Khasmir. Pakistan
feels that this SO per cent. Muslim
province is vital to her prosperity
because three of her livers have
their sources there.
The state of Pakistan, formed in
10i7 under the leadership of Ali
Jinnah, is being run on the basis of
an Islamic state. This means no dis
tinction of creed or caste, although
the majority of the 80 million Pakis
tin arc Muslims.
The new state is faced wtih tre
mendous problems. Ninety per cent
of the people arc illiterate. The
country cannot afford lrÂ» spend
money for social welfare because
over half of the revenue is spent
on defense. Improvements in indus
try and better agricultural equip
ment arc needed desperately.
Under the leadership of the Be
gum the women of Pakistan are now
helping their country. In 1947, over
a million refugees came to Pakistan.
Because there were no housing or
hospital facilities, the women bat
tled against old prejudices and be
came nurses. Today there arc over
500 nurses in training.
Since then, the Begum has helped
to organize the Pakistan National
Women's Guard, a voluntary or
ganization based on military con
trol. The girls arc taught social
welfare work, typing, and signaling.
The Pakistan Cottage Industries,
which enable three stores to give
their profits to charity, and the
All-Pakistan Women's Association,
which cncourages political and cul
tural education, arc two other as
sociations which the Begum lias
helped to establish.
In closing the Begum added that
according to the constitution beinc
written, women will be given the
privilege of voting regardless of
property or literacy qualifications.
