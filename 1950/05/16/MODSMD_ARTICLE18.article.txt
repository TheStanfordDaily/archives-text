# 'Good Morning-DA 3-9411' Is Familiar Stanford Greeting
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
The l>iitiicsl. little switchboard on
the Peninsula is located in a quiet,
orange - tree shaded corner of the
Stanford Quad.
This is the operations center for
the Stanford administration, DA
3-9411.
To rcach it, one must first go
down eight stairs bordered on the
left by a row of garbage cans, up
six stairs to a door concealed by one
of Stanford's artistic archways,
through the doorway and up seven
more stairs ending with what at
first glance seems a blank wall.
But in the shadows to the left is
another doorway marked 127, EM
PLOYEES ONLY â€”a locked door
which will be opened only after a
few resounding knocks.
There, in what once was part of
the backstage of the old auditorium,
three women connect incoming calls
with any one of the 400 different ex
tensions of DA 3-9411.
Although most of the work con

:;i.t;, of connecting cal'eis with the
administrative offices, the monotony
is often relieved by unusual que
ries or by special events.
Sometimes the switchboard opei J
a tors find themselves expected to J
answer such requests as "Where do
I go to donate my eyes?" "Where
can I see about turning my body
over to medical research?" and "I'm
suffering from arthritis. Can you
recommend a good doctor?"
The celebration of Herbert Hoo
ver's birthday last summer holds
special memories for the Univer
sity switchboard operators. They
kept the lines open for a few hours
so that reporters could telephone
their stories, and when Mr. Hoover
found out about this, he sent them
a personally signed letter as well
as a birthday cake.
Each operator remains at the
switchboard for two - hour shifts
with a 20-minute break at that time.
The board is officially open from 8
a.m. to fi p.m. It takes about a
month to train a new girl to the job

if lir ha:, not had any previous
switchboard framing.
New operators sometimes create
problems. One time an English girl
with a tliic*k acrent was reported for
being indignant when in clipper!
tones she insisted on finding out
whether the caller wanted Rathbun
or Rath vim.
The one tie-line (toll free) to San
Francisco provides chances for a
friendly rivalry as each operator ar
gues to get her "customer" on first,
claiming "he's been waiting longer
than yours has."
Another pet problem is keeping
track of people who have switched
departments and have not notified
them.
"But for the most part." the girls
say, "our 'customers' arc very po
lite anrl patient about waiting for
their calls to be put through."
When asked how they were dif
ferent from other telephone opera
tors, one of them laughingly com
mented, "Well, we're the only oper
ators with a Ph.D."
