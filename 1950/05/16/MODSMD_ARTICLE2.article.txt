## 
### 
WASHING TO N Senate and
House conferencees today agreed to
a $3,121,450,000 program fo Ameri
can economic aid to Europe and
other non-Communist areas in the
fiscal year starting July 1.
Breaking a week-long deadlock,
the conferees set the stage for final
votes in both chambers on the huge
global aid program. The agreement
marked a partial victory for admin
istration leaders.
Besides providing for the third
year of the four - year Marshall
Plan aid for Europe's economic re
covery, the compromise bill calls for
aid to Korea and for the launching
of President Truman's "Point. Four"
program of technical aid to the
world's underdeveloped areas. The
measure will come before the House
for a vote on Wednesday, and pas
sage is predicted without difficulty.
