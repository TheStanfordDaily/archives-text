# Stanford's 'Winds' Blow in Berlin
## 
### 
In 1948 a group of German educators and
students revolted against the totalitarian dog
ma prevailing in Berlin's Friedrich Wilhelm
University and established the Free University
of Berlin.
The new university was given legal status on
November 10 of that year by statutes passed by
the Berlin city government in the United States
Zone.
Our military government in Berlin imme
diately provided advice and assistance lor the
Free University, helping to secure funds, fuel,
food, transportation for staff and supplies, and
opening its 110,000-volurne library for the use
of Free University students.
Recently we received a letter from former
Daily Editor Beth Mac Vicar, '47, written from
Berlin, where she is with the Office of Public
Affairs, Public Relations Division.
Enclosed with Beth's letter was a press re
lease from the Office of the United States High
Commissioner for Germany, which told ol
American gifts of clothing to Free University
students. The release stated:
"Notable among the contributions was Stan
ford University . . . which channelled con
siderable supplies through CRALOG (Co-oper
ative of Relief Aqencies Licensed lor Operation
in Germany) to Free University Students."
To Stanford's SIRO organization and to the
students who contributed clothing this means

"a job well done." Or, rather, part of a job
well done. There is still much misery and need
in countries abroad.
Perhaps the best way to explain the situa
tion is to let you read Beth Mac Vicar's letter:
"Imagine the pleasure and pride with which
I picked up the enclosed release at the Berlin
Press Center this morning. Having been around
in the days when Stanford's 'relief' projects
were a snarl of hot air and campus politics, I
read the release with the profoundest respect
lor the 'old school.'
"You surely know how badly whatever you
send still is needed here. Free University stu
dents are having a bad enough time trying to
maintain their 'opposition university' without
the vast physical deprivation which they share
in common with everyone else. Oldtimers
maintain, however, that 'you wouldn't know
the city now, from a year ago.' . . . which is
encouraging. Shops are full again, for those
with money to buy; there are still far too many
who cannot buy for themselves the things they
need for normal life, normal study.
"The 'hot-air' days were fun—they made us
feel important—but these days are ever so
much more important. Do keep sending what
you can. Berlin Germans, at least, know who's
sending the goods, and they are appreciative."
We think that pretty well sums it up.
