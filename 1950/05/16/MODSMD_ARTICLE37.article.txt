### RALPH HANDY 
Eighty - three Farm midshipmen
will "see the world" this summer
through the NROTC summer train
ing program.
Stanford's Navy officers-in-the
making will be among approximately
6,000 NROTC college men training
this summer aboard various ships of
the Atlantic and Pacific fleets; at the
Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Fla.;
the Naval Amphibious Base, Little
Creek, Va.; and the Marine Corps
Schools, Quantico, Va.
During the summer these men will
receive diversified training in all
phases of Naval activity from sub
marine and aviation indoctrination to
general shipboard duty and amphi
bious operations.
Eight Stanford seniors and 32
sophomores will join the Pacific Heet
at San Francisco June 17 for a six
week cruise of Pacific waters that
will take them to Pearl Harbor, San
Diego, and the San Clernente Island
area before returning to San Fran
cisco July 30.
Midshipmen making the Pacific
cruise will have a week layover at
Pearl Harbor from June 30 to July 6.
The NROTC office urges that Stan
ford coeds living in Honolulu or va
cationing in that area avail them
selves of the Midshipmen dance to be
given during the stopover aboard the
aircraft carrier USS Bandoeng Strait.
Relief Expedition
Four Stanford midshipmen have
been chosen to accompany the an
nual relief expedition to the naval
installation at Point Barrow, Alaska.
Except for a short and uncertain
period in midsummer, Point Barrow
is completely ice-bound the year
around. During this period the Navy
convoy has to slip in, transfer its
supplies to lighters for the landing
operation, and get out before the ice
comes in again. The seven-ship con
voy expects to unload all its supplies
within seven days. Men going on this
trip will join their ships at Seattle
on July 12.
Juniors will receive four weeks of
aviation indoctrination training at
the Naval Air Station, Pensacola,
Fla.; and two weeks of amphibious
training at the Naval Amphibious
Base, Little Creek, Va. This program
is intended to give the prospective
naval officer a broader background
of two of the Navy's functions.
Second Lieutenants
At Quantico, Va., six midshipmen
designated as Marine Corps students
will undergo an eight-week summer
training program. These students,
upon graduation from Stanford, will
be commissioned .second lieutenants
in the US Marine Corps Reserve.
The NROTC program is designed
to supplement the US Naval Acad
emy in producing career officers for
the Navy and Marine Corps, and to
provide a continuous supply oi
young, well-trained officers for the
reserve components of (he two serv
ices.
Commenting on the program, Vice-

Admiral John W. Roper, Chief of
Naval Personnel, said:
"The four years ftf college educa
tion which includes comprehensive
study of Naval science, supple
mented with the summer training
periods, gives the NROTC graduates
an educational background and pro
fessional training which allows them
to serve side-by-side in the Heet with
Naval Academy graduates."
