Amid the weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth that follows the 24th An
nual West Coast Relays, one fact stands out beyond all others. The team
that did mil run in the two-mile relay placed second. By so doing, it won
the meet.
~*The other facts that lead up to the above, in order of their happening, are
as follows:
1. The inspector on the curve called USC's Bob Pruitt on fouling UCLA's
Jack Mil lei. Pruitt fouled while passing the Bruin on the last lap of the race.
2. UCLA protested.
use, in the person of Pruitt, admitted the foul when confronted by the
officials.
4. Amos Alonzo Stagg, official referee, signed the document which dis
qualified use in that race. Thus, UCLA won, Cal was second, Stanford
third, and no other entry was counted. USC was counted as not having been
in the race.
5. USC won second place in a four-team race.
Up to number four of the above, everything was as it should have been.
USC had been disqualified as it should have been. Track races have been
so run lor years upon years.
But another factor entered. It is here that I plant my footprints on some
what hallowed ground. Amos Alonzo Stagg, the grand old man ol football,
track, and what have you, took it upon himself to reverse the time-honored
ruling and award the Trojans second place. As yet, not one writer or track
fan has come forth with an example of a similar ruling ever having been
given, anywhere.
The sportswriters who covered the meet are generally agreed that Stagg
did wrong—even the men from the Southland. He had no excuse for taking
it upon himself the privilege of overthrowing all recognized track procedure.
You just don't do things like that. It might be compared to our own Excom
deciding that the polls should be open an extra day—after the polls have
been closed and the votes counted. You just don't do it.
But Stagg (and Excom) did it.and thereby hangs the tale. Stagg claims
that, being as the Uelan recovered from the foul and finished second, USC
.should be given second place. Just like they do in horse races—| but not
in track |.
The faults here are many. First, the act of Stagg in so ruling is wrong.
His thought, so it seems, was that giving USC the second spot was the fair
thing to do. I can see that point. Both Stanford and Cal were 100 yards out
of it as far as winning the race. "We are setting a precedent," lie said. If
this were the only factor in his ruling, the least we could say about it is that
he is wrong, he should know better, and the rules—which he helped write —
called for USC being tossed out of the race completely.
Second. Stagg, grand old man that he is, had no business being the official
referee. Charlie Hunter, Fresno State athletic director, and the originator
of the Fresno event, was shunted to the job of Honorary Referee. The posi
tions should have been switched. Stagg is entering upon his 89th year. He
has served sports as well as any man, but there is a point beyond which he
should step aside.
Close-hand observers on the field have told me (hat he had difficulty
remembering which team was being disqualified, which coach repre
sented Stanford, and which coach represented USC. and in general was
not up to the job required of him.
He also made the statement that "You Stanford men are always complain
ing." This after the representative of the school had tried to explain, logical
ly and with restraint, that the rule said that USC must be disqualified—and
thus out of the race by common practice over 40 or 50 years of track racing.
The rules say, "the referee shall have power to disqualify" and "his
decision is final and without appeal." Ilill appealed and won his argu
ment and the meet.
I would feel this way regardless of the schools involved. Stanford did not
deserve to win the meet off its showings that night. We did not do that well.
But USC was not the winner either. Stanford should have won on the
recognized technicality. USC won on an unprecedented technicality. It
should not be.
Suppose Stanford or Cal had been 4, 10, or ?>0 yards back of the foul. How
would Stagg have ruled then? That is why the rule has developed that the
fouling team is last, or out of the race completely.
It is with deep regret that such a revered person as Mr. Stagg should be
a target for attack. There are those who think he did right in view of the
positions of the trailing teams. But the fact remains that he allowed his
original decision to be altered by the persuasive Mr. Hill and Co. A man of
sterner stuff would have stuck by the rules.
But it is all over and done with. The mighty Trojans won again, but it
was the most hollow of victories. I only hope that the ruling will not haunt
future events. A very bad precedent has been set. Fresno should choose
its officials with greater care.

tions should have been switched. Stagg is entering upon his 89th year. He
has served sports as well as any man, but there is a point beyond which he
should step aside.
Close-hand observers on the field have told me (hat he had difficulty
remembering which team was being disqualified, which coach repre
sented Stanford, and which coach represented USC. and in general was
not up to the job required of him.
He also made the statement that "You Stanford men are always complain
ing." This after the representative of the school had tried to explain, logical
ly and with restraint, that the rule said that USC must be disqualified—and
thus out of the race by common practice over 40 or 50 years of track racing.
The rules say, "the referee shall have power to disqualify" and "his
decision is final and without appeal." Ilill appealed and won his argu
ment and the meet.
I would feel this way regardless of the schools involved. Stanford did not
deserve to win the meet off its showings that night. We did not do that well.
But USC was not the winner either. Stanford should have won on the
recognized technicality. USC won on an unprecedented technicality. It
should not be.
Suppose Stanford or Cal had been 4, 10, or ?>0 yards back of the foul. How
would Stagg have ruled then? That is why the rule has developed that the
fouling team is last, or out of the race completely.
It is with deep regret that such a revered person as Mr. Stagg should be
a target for attack. There are those who think he did right in view of the
positions of the trailing teams. But the fact remains that he allowed his
original decision to be altered by the persuasive Mr. Hill and Co. A man of
sterner stuff would have stuck by the rules.
But it is all over and done with. The mighty Trojans won again, but it
was the most hollow of victories. I only hope that the ruling will not haunt
future events. A very bad precedent has been set. Fresno should choose
its officials with greater care.
Amid the weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth that follows the 24th An
nual West Coast Relays, one fact stands out beyond all others. The team
that did mil run in the two-mile relay placed second. By so doing, it won
the meet.
~*The other facts that lead up to the above, in order of their happening, are
as follows:
1. The inspector on the curve called USC's Bob Pruitt on fouling UCLA's
Jack Mil lei. Pruitt fouled while passing the Bruin on the last lap of the race.
2. UCLA protested.
use, in the person of Pruitt, admitted the foul when confronted by the
officials.
4. Amos Alonzo Stagg, official referee, signed the document which dis
qualified use in that race. Thus, UCLA won, Cal was second, Stanford
third, and no other entry was counted. USC was counted as not having been
in the race.
5. USC won second place in a four-team race.
Up to number four of the above, everything was as it should have been.
USC had been disqualified as it should have been. Track races have been
so run lor years upon years.
But another factor entered. It is here that I plant my footprints on some
what hallowed ground. Amos Alonzo Stagg, the grand old man ol football,
track, and what have you, took it upon himself to reverse the time-honored
ruling and award the Trojans second place. As yet, not one writer or track
fan has come forth with an example of a similar ruling ever having been
given, anywhere.
The sportswriters who covered the meet are generally agreed that Stagg
did wrong—even the men from the Southland. He had no excuse for taking
it upon himself the privilege of overthrowing all recognized track procedure.
You just don't do things like that. It might be compared to our own Excom
deciding that the polls should be open an extra day—after the polls have
been closed and the votes counted. You just don't do it.
But Stagg (and Excom) did it.and thereby hangs the tale. Stagg claims
that, being as the Uelan recovered from the foul and finished second, USC
.should be given second place. Just like they do in horse races—| but not
in track |.
The faults here are many. First, the act of Stagg in so ruling is wrong.
His thought, so it seems, was that giving USC the second spot was the fair
thing to do. I can see that point. Both Stanford and Cal were 100 yards out
of it as far as winning the race. "We are setting a precedent," lie said. If
this were the only factor in his ruling, the least we could say about it is that
he is wrong, he should know better, and the rules—which he helped write —
called for USC being tossed out of the race completely.

Up to number four of the above, everything was as it should have been.
USC had been disqualified as it should have been. Track races have been
so run lor years upon years.
But another factor entered. It is here that I plant my footprints on some
what hallowed ground. Amos Alonzo Stagg, the grand old man ol football,
track, and what have you, took it upon himself to reverse the time-honored
ruling and award the Trojans second place. As yet, not one writer or track
fan has come forth with an example of a similar ruling ever having been
given, anywhere.
The sportswriters who covered the meet are generally agreed that Stagg
did wrong—even the men from the Southland. He had no excuse for taking
it upon himself the privilege of overthrowing all recognized track procedure.
You just don't do things like that. It might be compared to our own Excom
deciding that the polls should be open an extra day—after the polls have
been closed and the votes counted. You just don't do it.
But Stagg (and Excom) did it.and thereby hangs the tale. Stagg claims
that, being as the Uelan recovered from the foul and finished second, USC
.should be given second place. Just like they do in horse races—| but not
in track |.
The faults here are many. First, the act of Stagg in so ruling is wrong.
His thought, so it seems, was that giving USC the second spot was the fair
thing to do. I can see that point. Both Stanford and Cal were 100 yards out
of it as far as winning the race. "We are setting a precedent," lie said. If
this were the only factor in his ruling, the least we could say about it is that
he is wrong, he should know better, and the rules—which he helped write —
called for USC being tossed out of the race completely.
Second. Stagg, grand old man that he is, had no business being the official
referee. Charlie Hunter, Fresno State athletic director, and the originator
of the Fresno event, was shunted to the job of Honorary Referee. The posi
tions should have been switched. Stagg is entering upon his 89th year. He
has served sports as well as any man, but there is a point beyond which he
should step aside.
Close-hand observers on the field have told me (hat he had difficulty
remembering which team was being disqualified, which coach repre
sented Stanford, and which coach represented USC. and in general was
not up to the job required of him.
He also made the statement that "You Stanford men are always complain
ing." This after the representative of the school had tried to explain, logical
ly and with restraint, that the rule said that USC must be disqualified—and
thus out of the race by common practice over 40 or 50 years of track racing.
The rules say, "the referee shall have power to disqualify" and "his
decision is final and without appeal." Ilill appealed and won his argu
ment and the meet.
I would feel this way regardless of the schools involved. Stanford did not
deserve to win the meet off its showings that night. We did not do that well.
But USC was not the winner either. Stanford should have won on the
recognized technicality. USC won on an unprecedented technicality. It
should not be.
Suppose Stanford or Cal had been 4, 10, or ?>0 yards back of the foul. How
would Stagg have ruled then? That is why the rule has developed that the
fouling team is last, or out of the race completely.
It is with deep regret that such a revered person as Mr. Stagg should be
a target for attack. There are those who think he did right in view of the
positions of the trailing teams. But the fact remains that he allowed his
original decision to be altered by the persuasive Mr. Hill and Co. A man of
sterner stuff would have stuck by the rules.
But it is all over and done with. The mighty Trojans won again, but it
was the most hollow of victories. I only hope that the ruling will not haunt
future events. A very bad precedent has been set. Fresno should choose
its officials with greater care.
