ball championship, let's take a quick
j rundown on the various league
winners to find out who are the fa
vorites to emerge best of em all.
Eneina 3E managed to capture the
pennant in League 1, but they had
to beat 4W twice to do so. The two
teams finished the regular season
all knotted up with three wins and
i one loss apiece. Then 2E pounded
out al5 to victory in the playoff
game.
The class of the frosh ball teams,
Eneina 2E I, swept through unde
: feated in League 2. If either of the
frosh entries goes far in the playoff
rounds, it will be this club, led by
| pitcher Monte Herring.
In the only race where firing is
still going on, League !5, DU JI still
has to beat Theta Chi If to clinch
the crown.

eyes of Crothers in a close race in

League 4. Both teams were unde- |
feuied until the linal game of the I
season, when Stern 4 fashioned a j
narrow 9 to 8 win over their hot I
competitors.
Sigma Chi String
One of the top teams on the Farm ]
which was almost unscored upon, I
won League 5. Sigma Chi, which |
answers to the description above, !
rules a major threat in the playoffs j
behind the sterling pitching of Ken I
LaCrosse and the heavy stickwork
of such stars as Bill Dailey.
Dclt I, wilh no stars but lots of
teamwork, upset Theta Chi I, semi
finalists in last year's playoffs, to

capture the flag in League (>. Ofl'
lliis fine showing, the Delts loom as
a dark horse contender for this
year's University championship.
Last year's champs and potential
repeaters, ATO, triumphed easily in
League 7. With Dick Bradshaw,
who hurled them to the title last
season, once again smoking them
across, ATO will be hard to defeat
when the going gels tough.
Kappa Sigs Win League K

in a close race for the crown in
League 8. Kappa Sig chucker Ster
ling Clayton was the margin of dif
ference between these two fighting j

finally been captured by El Toio.
El Campo led its League 5) with
four against ono loss. However, El
Toro with three wins and a loss
came from behind to defeat El

the University championship.

gained a place in the playoffs by
going through an impressive unde
feated season to capture the crown
