# Cards Meet Gaels Today In Final Home Game
## Hurler Joe Chez Called On To Protect Stanford's Lead 
### JOHN HALL 
With the this-is-it flags /lying,
and opportunity knocking at the
gates in the form of ncxt-to-last
placc St. Mary's, Stanford will re
turn to the Sunken Diamond this
afternoon to start digging in for a
last - ditch protection of its half
game CfBA leadership.
The two - game scries with St.
Mary's is all that remains to block
Stanford from cinching at least a tie
for the CfBA championship. Two
straight wins over the Gaels com
bined with a USC loss during this
final week would give the title to
the Cards uncontested.
Sophomore Joe Chez, the league's
leading hurlcr with 6 wins and no
losses, will be Everett Dean's num
ber one hope this afternoon when
he will start round one of his two
round attempt to fiing Stanford past
St. Mary's and into that champion
ship.
Chez will throw in the first pitch
at 3:15, with Dave Stott ready in
reserve. Admission is free.
Should Stanford win today, then

repeat next Saturday at Moraga,
and should USC win all three of
its remaining games, the loop race
would end in a dead heat, both
clubs finishing with a 10-5 season
effort. A sudden death payofT play
off would then follow, probably in
the Sunken Diamond, as the 1947
playoffs were scheduled for Bovard
Field in Los Angeles.
It is even possible that, the finish
could get into a worse tangle with
four different teams — Stanford,
USC, California, and, Santa Clara—
getting into the knot at 9 wins and
ft losses.
But Everett Dean, who has an ex
cellent chance of grabbing off a
CIBA pennant his first year out,
isn't taking time to think about such
things. Dean stated yesterday that
the Cards were concentrating on St.
Mary's and forgetting about USC
and Santa Clara.
"We'll bank everything on win
ning these next two—and let the
other teams fall where they may,"
said the head man yesterday, as he
pointed out that his entire pitching
staff - Chez, Hcinen, Claypool, and
Stott—would be on call for both
games.
Dutch Fehring, Dean's able as
sistant, was optimistic about out
lasting USC if Stanford can shut out
the Gaels. "USC goes uphill all the
way in facing UCLA, St. Mary's,
