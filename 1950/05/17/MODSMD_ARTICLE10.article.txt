STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May
If! (/P) —There was talk aplenty to
night around the Stanford campus
of a party and a strip-tease dancer.
But there was nothing official.
All that was official was the fact
that Kappa Alpha fraternity was
divested of its social privileges for
the rest of 1950 and 16 of its stu
dents were ordered to move out of
the house at once.
Asked for particulars, Fred Glo
ver, director of information, limited
himself to this comment:
"It wasn't pretty."
The buzz around the campus was
to the effect that there had been a
party two weeks ago at some place
in Los Altos, that a strip - tease
dancer from San Francisco per
formed, after which the party got
out of hand.
Robert Burnett, of the Stanford
coaching staff, who moved into
Kappa Alpha today as alumni ad
viser, said the party was "a normal
house function until . .
Then he added he considered to
day's order, which Stanford Presi
dent Wallace Sterling approved, "a
reasonable penalty."
