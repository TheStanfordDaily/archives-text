## Athey Lists Television Difficulties 
### 
Difficulties in television, "the most
expensive uninvented devicc that is
in the business for making money,"
were discussed by Professor Skip
with Athey in last night's Tuesday
Evening Series talk.
The professor of electrical engi
neering and speech and drama ex
plained that TV is still in the process
of being invented due to unsolved
technical problems. Primary among
j these is a limited amount of space
over the air waves.
Radio shares the spectrum with
TV and has proved to be a cheaper,
easier, and more wide-spread means
| of communication.
Athey pointed out that a television
program takes 600 times as much
space as a radio program because of
I the double dose of sound and pic
j lure.
With no solution for making more
space available for TV, the Federal
j Communications Commission has
frozen applications for TV stations
i since October 1048.
Another difficulty, cited by Athey,
is the present controversy over
color.
Athey, who recently returned from
New York where he served as a TV
engineer for CBS, urged that black
and white pictures be improved be
fore a new path is taken.
The enormous cost in televising a
program, which includes fabulous
sums for performers, technical
workers, lights, and equipment, is a
further obstacle.
For those TV fans in San Fran
cisco who anticipate Ihe transmis
sion of shows from New York and
Chicago, Athey presented a rather
pessimist ic out look.
The coaxial cable which is being
built from the East to the West
Coast does not yet, present a satis
factory transmission of TV programs.
TV signals have to be amplified every
nine miles, so that the end product
is usually a vague representation of
the original.
Athey concluded that the result of
these many limitations will mean the
same old television for several more
years.
