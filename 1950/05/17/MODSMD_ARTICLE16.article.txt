# Paly Rent Controls to End; Students Man Expect Increases
## 
### 
Rent controls will be abolished for
Palo Alto sometime this week, pos
sibly today.
The formal order from Federal
Mousing Expediter Tighc E. Woods
will be the first to affect a sizable
community in Northern California.
The order will involve some 4.000
to 5,000 apartments and houses in
this area.
Menlo Park already has acted
under the local option plan and has
its petition for decontrol before
Governor Warren.
Palo Alto landlords met last week
to set up a system of voluntary con- j
trol.
They voted to keep rent increases
within 10 to 15 per cent for the next j

six months, and went on record
against extreme increases to evict
undesirable tenants.
A rent advisory board of 10 mem
bers—three not landlords —was set.
up to listen to grievances from ten
ants and landlords. It would rec
ommend action, but has no actual
power to enforce its recommenda
tions.
Opponents of the decontrol move
were inclined to scoff at the policy
| of reasonable increases.
Numerous students who rent
houses together in Palo Alto have
' been notified that increases sub
stantially above the association's 15
I per cent limit will be levied.
