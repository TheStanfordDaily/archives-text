# Trains Roll As Six-Day Strike Ends
## 
### 
CHICAGO, May IK (/P)—Key seg
ments of the nation's rail system be
gan rolling with passengers and
freight today after settlement of the
biggest railroad strike in four years.
Minutes after word of the agree
ment was received, the struck lines
began recalling engine and train
crews. All the lines said they ex
pected to be virtually back to nor
mal by tomorrow.
The rail lines rushed empty
freight cars to coal mines and in
dustrial plants where lack of trans
portation facilities had brought
shutdowns or production curtail
ments.
An agreement, ending the six-day
strike of locomotive firemen that
had spread to five big rail systems,
was reached early today. But the
railroads still had other laboi
worries.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers has authorized a strike
against the nation's railroads on
much the same issue that led to the
firemen's strike. The firemen had
demanded an extra fireman on big
diesels. The enginers also want an
extra man in the cab. But they want
him to be an engineer.
However, the engineers' union
has made no threats of an early
strike.
The firemen's union and carriers
will meet tomorrow with the Na
tional (Railway) Mediation Board
to work out details for appointment
of an arbitration board.
The union's principal demand —
one that had been rejected by two
presidential fact - finding boards —
was for a second fireman on mul
tiple-unit, diesel locomotives.
