## Thoughts of Sickening Things 
### 
Insomnia is u common enough complaint, but it
seems I am attacked with an exaggerated form of it.
Though this ailment causes the loss of many dreams, I
welcome it, for it has enabled me to devote many extra
hour:: to reading and thinking. In fact, 1 have stolen so
many hours from the night in recent years that I
would be justified if I added another year to my age,
for 1 have certainly "lived" that much longer.
Last night was one ol the nights given to thinking.
I thought of all the things of which I am sick and made
a list, of them. The list went somewhat as follows:
"1 am sick of movie actresses with green ( yes. I am
::ick of radio announcers who talk a lot but say noth
ing. 1 am sick of people who pretend they have no ego.
1 urn sick of being asked if people spoke English in
China. I am sick of Havana cigars made in America
and long for an Egyptian cigarette made in London. I
am sick of B-pluses. 1 am sick of people who have the
strange idea that my bicycle is a public utility I am
Mck of women who say, 'I'd love to, but....' in
stead of a direct 'No.'
"1 am sick of hearing so much about Christianity
and finding so few Christians. I am sick ol lecturers
who try to be funny. I am sick of people who avoid
thinking for themselves by merely subscribing to the

current public opinion. I am sick of the California
sunshine. I am sick of looking at the pin-ups above
my bed. I am sick ol the society of old Hong Kong
friends they remind one so of Hong Kong.
"I am sick of having my column referred to as
'"What's Wong With the World." I am sick of remind
ing people that my column is not supposed to be
amusing. 1 am sick of falling asleep in class. I am sick
ol hearing about Communists who are going to con
quer the world. 1 am sick of eggs for breakfast. I am
sick ol being unable to find a good excuse for life. I
am sick of songs about cakes.
"I am sick of being unable to make my voice sound
as rich as it does when I am in the showers. 1 am sick
of hearing people say, "Be reasonable," when so few
people ever use their reason. I am sick of counting
the number of lights on the ceiling of Memorial Audi
torium. I am sick of bigots. I am sick of men who act
like monkeys. I am sick of bystanders who must give
theii opinion as to how a card hand should be played.
I arn sick of rum."
At this point, I read the list over once and stopped
thinking. 1 was slightly frightened. I found 1 was sick
of everything and everybody. I was even beginning
to get sick of myself.
