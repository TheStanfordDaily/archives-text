## Cal-Stanford Frosh Exchange 
### 
To the Editor:
Though the poor weather last Saturday prevented
the Cal-Stanford Frosh Exchange Irwin becoming a
highly successful event, 1 can still say that the job done
by the committees for the day could not have been
better. The work and time they devoted to organizing
the event deserves a great deal of thanks.
So, not only to Joyce Ballantine, Chuck Denny, Pefe

Grothe, Jiin Mitchell, Maxine Pierce, Tom Schabarum,
Chuck Silverberg, and Bobby Southard, who were the
committee chairmen, but also to all those who helped
wilh the afternoon activities, the dinner, the enter
tainment, the dance, the publicity, and the clean up,
may 1 give my thanks and sincere appreciation lor a
fine job, well done.
