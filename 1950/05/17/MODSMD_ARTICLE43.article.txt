# SECOND SINCE 1915
## Crew Accepts Invitation To Marietta Oar Classic 
### 
Stanford's much - beleaguered
crew yesterday received and ac
cepted an invitation to compete in
the Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
tion Regatta at Marietta, Ohio, on
July 17. It pretty well classifies the
Indian rowers as one of the eleven
(jest aggregations in the nation. Just
how iar up in the Big Eleven it
puts them will, of course, be decided
by their outcome in this crewman's
Big Game.
It is the Cards' second invitation
since 1915â€”the rowmen went last
year only to meet with no success
and a disappointing eleventh place
in a field of 12. (Strictly speaking,
this is the Cards' first invitation to
Marietta. It is everyone's first in
vite.) The regatta has previously
been held at Poughkeepsie, New
York, but this year was transferred
to Marietta because of better course
conditions there. The Poughkeepsie

records, however, are being carried
over.
Besides the IRA member schools
of Columbia, Navy, 6yracuse, Penn
sylvania, and Cornell, bids have al
ready been accepted by California,
Washington, Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, Princeton, and
the University of Wisconsin.
The acceptance of the Marietta
invitation was the crewmen's cue
to begin a campus-wide campaign
to raise the $3,000 necessary to
transport shell and oarsmen back to
the Ohio water festivities. This sum
will cover the shell shipping costs,
the train tickets, and living ex
penses of the 14 men who will go
to help man her.
A crew representative said tele
grams and letters would be sent to
Stanford alumni groups throughout
the nation beginning today. Nine
teen girls in the Crew Auxiliary
will process the correspondence,
which will range from 300 to 500
dispatches.
