# Card Rally Blasts Gaels, 9 to 4: Chez in 7th Win as End Nears
## Troy Keeps Pace With Cards By Swamping Bruins, 13 to 1 
### JOHN HALL 
Preacher Tom Shaw slashed out a 375-foot clutch triple yester
day to unload two baserunners and set Stanford off to a five-run
eighth-inning rally, as the Cards surged past St. Mary's, 9 to 4, on
the Sunken Diamond, to pull up within one game of their first
CIBA championship in 19 years.
Shaw's blow landed high on the left field bank, and before the

♦Gael outfielders could recover, Tom
had rolled into third, and Dick Clegg
and Jim Trabucco had poured across
the rubber with the game-clinching
runs.
Hut, the Tribe failed to increase
ilh half-game league lead, as Tom
Lovrich hurled USC to a 111 to 1
victory over UCLA in Los Angeles.
Che/ Wins Seventh
Joe Chez, hitting and fielding too,
went the distance to post his seventh
straight CIBA conquest against no
defeats. Chez scattered 10 hits, was
in serious trouble only twice, and
looked just as good as his statistics.
It was Stanford's ninth league win
of the season, lifted the record to 9
and 5, and marked one of the few
times all year that a Card hurler has
finished an entire game.
Reds Ice It in Eighth
But it was all in doubt until the
Card explosion in the eighth. St.
Mary's opened fast with a run in the
first, then added single runs in the
fourth and sixth, to coast into the
stretch inning with a nice 3 to 1 ad
vantage.
Here, the Cards, sniffing that pen
nant breeze, jumped on Ken Figue
roid with 3 hits and 3 runs to gain
the lead for the first time, 4 to 3.
Tom Shaw started the parade with
a single past short, and then after
Bill Herron had walked, pitcher
hitter Joe Chez dumped a lob single
into right to score Shaw. Another
single by Bruce Cameron, one of
lour, and a long fiy by Charlie Cole
brought in the other two runs.
But St. Mary's, still hanging on,
came back with the tying run in the
top of the eighth. However, at this
point, the Cards were through fool

ing around, and although Gael ace
Carroll Canfield had replaced starter
Ken Figueroid on the mound, Stan
ford turned loose its lumber with a
five-run burst. This is how it hap
pened:
Dick Clegg and Jim Trabucco drew
walks, at which time second sacker
Shaw coolly unleashed his triple, and
that was it. But Stanford wasn't sat
isfied. Catcher Herron shot a liner
down the third base line which was
too hot for Duane Kling, Shaw scor
ing. Bruce Cameron followed with
his fourth hit, his longest up on the
bank in left-center, Herron scoring.
Charlie Cole singled in Cameron,
and Bud Klein, the ninth man to face
Canfield that inning, finally ended
the spree by flying to center. Two
pitches before, Klein had been
jobbed of a hit by Canfield's called
balk.
Cole turned in the game's out
standing fielding gem when he made
a running, diving, rolling catch of
Vince Estrada's long drive to open
the ninth.
NEXT SATURDAY: St. Mary's at
Moraga, with all the money on the
table.

But St. Mary's, still hanging on,
came back with the tying run in the
top of the eighth. However, at this
point, the Cards were through fool

ing around, and although Gael ace
Carroll Canfield had replaced starter
Ken Figueroid on the mound, Stan
ford turned loose its lumber with a
five-run burst. This is how it hap
pened:
Dick Clegg and Jim Trabucco drew
walks, at which time second sacker
Shaw coolly unleashed his triple, and
that was it. But Stanford wasn't sat
isfied. Catcher Herron shot a liner
down the third base line which was
too hot for Duane Kling, Shaw scor
ing. Bruce Cameron followed with
his fourth hit, his longest up on the
bank in left-center, Herron scoring.
Charlie Cole singled in Cameron,
and Bud Klein, the ninth man to face
Canfield that inning, finally ended
the spree by flying to center. Two
pitches before, Klein had been
jobbed of a hit by Canfield's called
balk.
Cole turned in the game's out
standing fielding gem when he made
a running, diving, rolling catch of
Vince Estrada's long drive to open
the ninth.

TOM SHAW
—"The Preacher cleans 'ein up"


CHARLIE COLE
—"Didja see that catch!"
Preacher Tom Shaw slashed out a 375-foot clutch triple yester
day to unload two baserunners and set Stanford off to a five-run
eighth-inning rally, as the Cards surged past St. Mary's, 9 to 4, on
the Sunken Diamond, to pull up within one game of their first
CIBA championship in 19 years.
Shaw's blow landed high on the left field bank, and before the

♦Gael outfielders could recover, Tom
had rolled into third, and Dick Clegg
and Jim Trabucco had poured across
the rubber with the game-clinching
runs.
Hut, the Tribe failed to increase
ilh half-game league lead, as Tom
Lovrich hurled USC to a 111 to 1
victory over UCLA in Los Angeles.
Che/ Wins Seventh
Joe Chez, hitting and fielding too,
went the distance to post his seventh
straight CIBA conquest against no
defeats. Chez scattered 10 hits, was
in serious trouble only twice, and
looked just as good as his statistics.
It was Stanford's ninth league win
of the season, lifted the record to 9
and 5, and marked one of the few
times all year that a Card hurler has
finished an entire game.
Reds Ice It in Eighth
But it was all in doubt until the
Card explosion in the eighth. St.
Mary's opened fast with a run in the
first, then added single runs in the
fourth and sixth, to coast into the
stretch inning with a nice 3 to 1 ad
vantage.
Here, the Cards, sniffing that pen
nant breeze, jumped on Ken Figue
roid with 3 hits and 3 runs to gain
the lead for the first time, 4 to 3.
Tom Shaw started the parade with
a single past short, and then after
Bill Herron had walked, pitcher
hitter Joe Chez dumped a lob single
into right to score Shaw. Another
single by Bruce Cameron, one of
lour, and a long fiy by Charlie Cole
brought in the other two runs.
But St. Mary's, still hanging on,

TOM SHAW
—"The Preacher cleans 'ein up"


CHARLIE COLE
—"Didja see that catch!"
Preacher Tom Shaw slashed out a 375-foot clutch triple yester
day to unload two baserunners and set Stanford off to a five-run
eighth-inning rally, as the Cards surged past St. Mary's, 9 to 4, on
the Sunken Diamond, to pull up within one game of their first
CIBA championship in 19 years.
Shaw's blow landed high on the left field bank, and before the

♦Gael outfielders could recover, Tom
had rolled into third, and Dick Clegg
and Jim Trabucco had poured across
the rubber with the game-clinching
runs.
Hut, the Tribe failed to increase
ilh half-game league lead, as Tom
Lovrich hurled USC to a 111 to 1
victory over UCLA in Los Angeles.
Che/ Wins Seventh
Joe Chez, hitting and fielding too,
went the distance to post his seventh
straight CIBA conquest against no
defeats. Chez scattered 10 hits, was
in serious trouble only twice, and
looked just as good as his statistics.
It was Stanford's ninth league win
of the season, lifted the record to 9
and 5, and marked one of the few
times all year that a Card hurler has
finished an entire game.
Reds Ice It in Eighth
But it was all in doubt until the
Card explosion in the eighth. St.
Mary's opened fast with a run in the
first, then added single runs in the
fourth and sixth, to coast into the
stretch inning with a nice 3 to 1 ad
vantage.
Here, the Cards, sniffing that pen
nant breeze, jumped on Ken Figue
roid with 3 hits and 3 runs to gain
the lead for the first time, 4 to 3.
Tom Shaw started the parade with
a single past short, and then after
Bill Herron had walked, pitcher
hitter Joe Chez dumped a lob single
into right to score Shaw. Another
single by Bruce Cameron, one of
lour, and a long fiy by Charlie Cole
brought in the other two runs.
But St. Mary's, still hanging on,
came back with the tying run in the
top of the eighth. However, at this
point, the Cards were through fool

ing around, and although Gael ace
Carroll Canfield had replaced starter
Ken Figueroid on the mound, Stan
ford turned loose its lumber with a
five-run burst. This is how it hap
pened:
Dick Clegg and Jim Trabucco drew
walks, at which time second sacker
Shaw coolly unleashed his triple, and
that was it. But Stanford wasn't sat
isfied. Catcher Herron shot a liner
down the third base line which was
too hot for Duane Kling, Shaw scor
ing. Bruce Cameron followed with
his fourth hit, his longest up on the
bank in left-center, Herron scoring.
Charlie Cole singled in Cameron,
and Bud Klein, the ninth man to face
Canfield that inning, finally ended
the spree by flying to center. Two
pitches before, Klein had been
jobbed of a hit by Canfield's called
balk.
Cole turned in the game's out
standing fielding gem when he made
a running, diving, rolling catch of
Vince Estrada's long drive to open
the ninth.
NEXT SATURDAY: St. Mary's at
Moraga, with all the money on the
table.
