# DU's Move Into Finals
## 
### 
Delta Upsilon's Softball mural
team clinched their league cham
pionship yesterday by downing the
Theta Chi nine 10 to 7. This final
victory puts them in line to meet
the winner of another league to
compete for the overall mural
championship.
Showing exceptional hitting and
fielding ability, the DU's jumped to
an early lead when they scored
seven men in the bottom of the first
frame to more than balance the two
runs Theta Chi had mustered.
In the second inning the Theta
Chi softballers threatened their ri
vals' lead by forcing four runs
across the plate and then in the bot
tom half of the frame putting down
the first three DU men to step to
the plate.
Theta Chi's rally got no farther,
however, as the DU men capitalized
on their opponents' numei>ous er
rors to put the game on ice in the
third and fourth innings.
