## 
### 
The little old lady paused for a
moment, squinted up at the student,
and said, "I just couldn't bear hav
ing the old-timers come back to
Stanford and see such conditions."
Before the interruption the mem
ber of the pioneer class of 1894 had
been busily engaged in pulling
weeds and thistles from alongside
the History corner of the Quad.
She had been working industri
ously at her job of removing the
eyesores, pulling the weeds and
then weaving her way among stu
dents who were headed toward the
Row for lunch to deposit the prickly
plants in a pile near the bike rac?ks.
She had collected a sizable stack
when questioned as to the reason
behind her undertaking the task.
"The Class of 1900 will be here
Saturday for their golden anniver
sary," she replied. "How would it
look to them to sec these weeds
sticking up here —right in front of

the Library for everybody to see?"
"I've been noticing them for over
a month now," she added. "Nobody
did anything about it so I decided
to pull them."
And pull them she did. Many of
the giant weeds and thistles towered
over her 4 - foot 11 - inch height.
Some had grown so that their tops
were almost on a level with the
raised portion of the Quad upon
which students walk to class.
The rush of students leaving their
11 o'c locks was over when she
turned back to go to work with the
comment, "Somebody had to do it,
you know."
So the members of the classes of
1900, 1904, and 1917, who meet here
Saturday, as well as the campus in
general will have a little old lady
who "doesn't want any publicity" to
thank for beautifying an important,
though forgotten, portion of the
Stanford Farm.
