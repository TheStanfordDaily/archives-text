# Trojan Sets, Modern Gimmicks To Top Spring Show Opening
## 
### 
Shimmering folds of copper satin
curtain will rise tomorrow on
one of the most elaborate technical
productions Ram's Head has at
tempted. The 1050 Spring Show,
entitled "Who Calls It War!" will
open at 8:15 in the Memorial Audi
torium and continue through Sat
urday.
Tickets are still on sale for all
three nights at the Memorial Audi
torium box office, the ASSU office,
and Engineering corner. Prices are
$1.15, 85 cents, and 55 cents.
Sets for the show, a satire on the
Trojan War, feature pseudo-classic
architecture with a few modern in
novations, such as telephones, ele
vators, revolving doors, and radios.

Doughnuts and cider will be
sold in the west patio of the Mem
Aud during the intermission of
the Spring Show.
The sale is sponsored by Theta
Sigma Phi, women's honorary
journalism fraternity.

The copper tone of the large con
tour curtain is repeated throughout
the sets anrl even reappears in the
form of body paint on a couple of
the dancers.
No version of the famous fable
would be complete without a Tro
jan Horse. The Spring Show's steed
which appears in the last act is 20
feet high and is bright chartreuse.
Technical director Dick Hay and
his crew have been working since
the beginning of the quarter on
technical devices to make every
scat in the house good. Scenery
and lighting arc all placed down
stage for greater visibility. Sus
pended microphones and increased
loudspeaker outlets will improve
the sound so that all the lines may
be heard in the top row of the
balcony.

Spring Show, 'Who Calls It War."
