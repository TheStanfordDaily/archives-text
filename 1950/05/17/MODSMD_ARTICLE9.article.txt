# Grads Form Council To Plan Government
## New Constitution Lays Plans For Increased Activity in Campus Affairs 
### 
Graduate students yesterday put their foot in the door to active
participation in campus activities by forming a Graduate Council
and drawing up a constitution.
A group of 11 graduate students, chosen by the deans of the
various schools, met in Union Court at 5 p.m. to form the council,

with the ultimate purpose of a
Graduate Excom.
The representatives indicated that
graduate students feel they arc not
included in enough student body af
fairs and that the purposes for which
ASSU money is used is not repre
sentative of graduate interests.
The delegates arc seeking to work
for the integration of graduate stu
dents in campus activities. They feel
(hat in this respect a graduate Excom
would be more effective than scat
tered individual effort.
Activity Proposals
Some of the proposed items for
consideration by the future Gradu
ate Excom are: a graduate clubhouse,
inclusion of graduate students into
certain classes, including gym classes, j
canoes at the Lagunita Boathouse, ;
ski club memberships for wives, foot- i
ball tickets for wives, and indoctrina- j
tion pamphlets for new graduate stu- !
dents on a graduate level.
They also suggested open houses in
graduate residences; social affairs,
such as exchanges, with more regu
larity; possible social liaison between i
Stanford and the University of C-ali- •
fornia; and promotion of faculty- j
graduate functions.
Next Meeting
Joan Cruz was elected chairman of |
a committee to continue the work of
the Graduate Council during the i
summer. Another meeting will be I
held next Tuesday at 5 p.m. in the ;
Excom Room.
For the past few months, Hank :
Grandin and Rex Johnson, graduate j
representatives in the ASSU Excom, !
have been working to form a Gradu
ate Excom.
Three weeks ago, Excom shelved j
their request for a graduate repre- l
sentative to the Social Policies Com
mittee until graduate interest could ;
be- proven.
The council's purpose, presented in
the newly-formed constitution, is to
promote social activities and a con
structive graduate program, co-ordi
nation of graduate activities on the
campus, and the bringing in to a
greater degree the graduate classes
to ASSU functions.
Co-chairman Hank Grandin said,
"This Council is solely an investiga
tory committee. Some of us felt that
the Stanford graduate students were !
being and had been neglected in
areas other than the academic field, i
"We thought we would sec what !
could be done. Now it. appears that :
there is a real need and a real po- '
tential for activities on a graduate '
level."

A group of 11 graduate students, chosen by the deans of the
various schools, met in Union Court at 5 p.m. to form the council,

with the ultimate purpose of a
Graduate Excom.
The representatives indicated that
graduate students feel they arc not
included in enough student body af
fairs and that the purposes for which
ASSU money is used is not repre
sentative of graduate interests.
The delegates arc seeking to work
for the integration of graduate stu
dents in campus activities. They feel
(hat in this respect a graduate Excom
would be more effective than scat
tered individual effort.
Activity Proposals
Some of the proposed items for
consideration by the future Gradu
ate Excom are: a graduate clubhouse,
inclusion of graduate students into
certain classes, including gym classes, j
canoes at the Lagunita Boathouse, ;
ski club memberships for wives, foot- i
ball tickets for wives, and indoctrina- j
tion pamphlets for new graduate stu- !
dents on a graduate level.
They also suggested open houses in
graduate residences; social affairs,
such as exchanges, with more regu
larity; possible social liaison between i
Stanford and the University of C-ali- •
fornia; and promotion of faculty- j
graduate functions.
Next Meeting
Joan Cruz was elected chairman of |
a committee to continue the work of
the Graduate Council during the i
summer. Another meeting will be I
held next Tuesday at 5 p.m. in the ;
Excom Room.
For the past few months, Hank :
Grandin and Rex Johnson, graduate j
representatives in the ASSU Excom, !
have been working to form a Gradu
ate Excom.
Three weeks ago, Excom shelved j
their request for a graduate repre- l
sentative to the Social Policies Com
mittee until graduate interest could ;
be- proven.
The council's purpose, presented in
the newly-formed constitution, is to
promote social activities and a con
structive graduate program, co-ordi
nation of graduate activities on the
campus, and the bringing in to a
greater degree the graduate classes
to ASSU functions.
Co-chairman Hank Grandin said,
"This Council is solely an investiga
tory committee. Some of us felt that
the Stanford graduate students were !
being and had been neglected in
areas other than the academic field, i
"We thought we would sec what !
could be done. Now it. appears that :
there is a real need and a real po- '
tential for activities on a graduate '
level."
Graduate students yesterday put their foot in the door to active
