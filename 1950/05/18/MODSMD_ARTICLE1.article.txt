### 
WASHINGTON, May 17 (/Pj—The
Senate today killed two more of
President Truman's reorganization
plans. One would have revamped
the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion and the other the Federal
Communications Commission.
Hie plans were among a series of
almost identical proposals Mr. Tru
man submitted to revise four regu
latory commissions — Commerce,
Communications, Trade, and Power.
The Senate last week rebuffed
Mr. Truman on two other reorgani
zation plans.
Resolutions to kill all four of the
regulatory commission plans were
sponsored by Chairman Edwin C.
Johnson (D., Colo.) of the Com
merce Committee. He objected that
the plans would set up "one-man
agencies."
The plans are identical in that
they would have vested in the
chairmen of the respective agencies
the power to: appoint and supervise
personnel; control the use and ex
penditure of funds, all subject to
the general policies of the commis
sions.
