'Flic employment outlook will lir*
fair and warmer for elementary
school teachers and dieticians,
stormy for secondary school teach
ers, and cloudy for lawyers and
engineers, according to I he United
States Labor Department predic
tions.
Teachers on the elementary level
should find a wide choice of em
ployment opportunities in most
states this spring, and for the next
few years. But more teachers are
needed for replacements than for
new positions.
Dieticians arc in demand, and
further expansion in the hospital
Held will increase the demand. The
possibilities in the field range from
work in hotels and institutions for
the aged to magazine and television
work. Dieticians also have good
chance for advancement.
Preparation includes graduation
from the home economics depart
ment of an accredited college with
a major in foods and nutrition. A

year's internship 1 .*, required. Al
though most, dieticians arc women,
men arc needed as fond administra
tors.
Secondary Teacher Competition
Secondary school teachers will
find heavy competition in fields of
men's physical education, social
sciences, and English. Shortages arc
present, however, in home econom
ics and in rural districts.
Requirements arc likely lo he
raised and graduates with a Mas
ter's degree will have the edge. But
past trends show a training rate as
high as thai of 1M!) would continue
lo produce an oversupply in the
field.
This year's law graduates will find
j stifT competition in most areas, but
can use their training as an asset in
other fields. Opportunities for spe
cialists are often better than for
lawyers in general practice. Over
the long run, the legal profession is
expected to expand as a result of
increased population and need for
legal services
Top - ranking students will con
tinue to find openings with relative
| ease. Aspiring lawyers arc advised

to go to relatively small cities, state
capitals, or county scats for the best
employment opportunities.
Engineering Growing
Engineering is the nation's third
largest profession and one of the
fastest growing. Cheat. numbers of
jobs are expected to be available
during the next decade. But in the
next couple of years, engineering
graduates aie likely to meet in
creasing competition because of the
post-war boom in college enroll
ments.
Men with special abilities or
training in research and design are
in demand. Engineering graduates
may also he qualified for adminis
trative, sales, or other technical
jobs. Those near the top in ability
generally have little trouble in gct
j ting jobs.
Since minimum requirements are
being raised gradually, post-grad
uate degrees may improve job op
portunities. Many employers also
I emphasize the extra-curricular col
lege record of prospective cmploy
| ees. Engineers may also apply for
positions with the State Division of
| Architecture.

'Flic employment outlook will lir*
fair and warmer for elementary
school teachers and dieticians,
stormy for secondary school teach
ers, and cloudy for lawyers and
engineers, according to I he United
States Labor Department predic
tions.
Teachers on the elementary level
should find a wide choice of em
ployment opportunities in most
states this spring, and for the next
few years. But more teachers are
needed for replacements than for
new positions.
Dieticians arc in demand, and
further expansion in the hospital
Held will increase the demand. The
possibilities in the field range from
work in hotels and institutions for
the aged to magazine and television
work. Dieticians also have good
chance for advancement.
Preparation includes graduation
from the home economics depart
ment of an accredited college with
a major in foods and nutrition. A

year's internship 1 .*, required. Al
though most, dieticians arc women,
men arc needed as fond administra
tors.
Secondary Teacher Competition
Secondary school teachers will
find heavy competition in fields of
men's physical education, social
sciences, and English. Shortages arc
present, however, in home econom
ics and in rural districts.
Requirements arc likely lo he
raised and graduates with a Mas
ter's degree will have the edge. But
past trends show a training rate as
high as thai of 1M!) would continue
lo produce an oversupply in the
field.
This year's law graduates will find
j stifT competition in most areas, but
can use their training as an asset in
other fields. Opportunities for spe
cialists are often better than for
lawyers in general practice. Over
the long run, the legal profession is
expected to expand as a result of
increased population and need for
legal services
Top - ranking students will con
tinue to find openings with relative
| ease. Aspiring lawyers arc advised

to go to relatively small cities, state
capitals, or county scats for the best
employment opportunities.
Engineering Growing
Engineering is the nation's third
largest profession and one of the
fastest growing. Cheat. numbers of
jobs are expected to be available
during the next decade. But in the
next couple of years, engineering
graduates aie likely to meet in
creasing competition because of the
post-war boom in college enroll
ments.
