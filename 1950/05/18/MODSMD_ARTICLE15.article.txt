# Trojans Invade Mem And Tonight for Spring Show
## 
### 
Greek and Trojan infantry will
invade the Memorial Auditorium
tonight at the opening performance
of the 1950 Ram's Head Spring
Show, "Who Calls It War!" Tick
ets, priced at $1.15, 85 cents, and
55 cents, arc still available for all
three nights. They are on sale at
the Memorial Auditorium box of
fice, the ASSU office, and the En
gineering corner.
The show is set in Troy at the
time of the war with Greece. In
this version, however, the whole
war was nothing but a farce pulled
off by a couple of con men for profit.
Frank Wolff plays Agamemnon, the
conniving leader of the Greeks, and
Tom Shipp portrays his scheming
cohort, the Oracle tif Delphi. The
leadership of Troy supposedly rests
with the incompetent but well
meaning King Priam (Bill Harley),
but it is his wife Queen Hecuba
(Kay Lloyd) who gives the orders.
Dick Jones plays Paris, who kid
naps Helen (Ginger McFadden)
only as a joke, and Don Campbell
portrays her husband, Menelaus,
who spends the course of the action
trying to get her back. Paris's real
heart interest is beautiful-but-dumb
Oinonc (Janie Allen). Dick Davis
plays Ajax, Agamemnon's body
guard.

| The book for the show is by Nor
man Wexler and Bill Dailey. Mort
| Zieve is the director. Assistant di
j rectors are Nick Gilroy and Bill
