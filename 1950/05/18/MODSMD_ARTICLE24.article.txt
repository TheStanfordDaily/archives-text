### CORNELIA LITTLE 
The headline in the University of Washington Daily
said "May Day Violence Noted"; the stoiy underneath
it explained that "a life-size plaster red bear placed
near the center of the quad was turned over and
jumped upon by a graduate student in languages, who
asked that his name not be used."
Maybe he realized that the action was a reflection
on his lack of a sense of humor. Some more of the
story:
"Come on," the irate student said as lie stomped off
one of the plaster legs of the bear. "Doesn't anybody
have the guts?"
"Don't you think it's a joke?" one student said.
"Well maybe—maybe some fraternity put it there,"
he commented as he took one last kick at the prostrate
bear.
In the background, a pink cardboard elephant ad
vertising the sophomore carnival leaned against a ma

Not just class honor, but sinus infections —or worse
were at stake in a frosh-soph tug-of-war held re
cently at the University of Oregon. The big pull was
to be held over the "storied and romantic" Mill race—
end according to a University doctor, the Millrace
v/as not just polluted, but "super-polluted."
The Millrace is a campus stream drawing water
from the Willamette River, which has been closed for
swimming for the past few years.
Only bright note for grim and determined upholders

of the tug tradition: u poll disclosed that several people
have gone swimming in the Millrace with no ill effects.
A Junior Weekend official commented that the pol
lution would add "realness" and spice to the tug. With,
no doubt, fiendish glee.

You've heard of colleges entering their queens in
national beauty contests, enrolling their publications
in national rating organizations, submitting their
scholastic averages to comparison with other schools;
but have you heard of a university entering its mas
cot in a dog show?
The University of Virginia did. In the mixed breed
classes their pet Sealburger walked off with two rib
bons and a trophy "for the glory of the university." In
doing this he repeated his performance of two years
ago, although the judge implied that "if he were to
enter the dog show next year, Seal would hav;-? to cut
down on his beer."

Courses in Russian languages and literature have
fallen by the wayside at San Jose State. They are all
being discontinued because of insufficient enrollment.
There was a time when colleges were putting Rus
sian on the curriculum, not taking it off. Maybe stu
dents are afraid even to know the language of Tolstoy
and Pushkin, for fear of provoking investigations.
Maybe they want to accept the Iron Curtain and adopt
a "see no Russian, hear no Russian, talk no Russian"
policy. Or maybe Russian was just too hard?

but have you heard of a university entering its mas
cot in a dog show?
The University of Virginia did. In the mixed breed
classes their pet Sealburger walked off with two rib
bons and a trophy "for the glory of the university." In
doing this he repeated his performance of two years
ago, although the judge implied that "if he were to
enter the dog show next year, Seal would hav;-? to cut
down on his beer."

Courses in Russian languages and literature have
fallen by the wayside at San Jose State. They are all
being discontinued because of insufficient enrollment.
There was a time when colleges were putting Rus
sian on the curriculum, not taking it off. Maybe stu
dents are afraid even to know the language of Tolstoy
and Pushkin, for fear of provoking investigations.
Maybe they want to accept the Iron Curtain and adopt
a "see no Russian, hear no Russian, talk no Russian"
policy. Or maybe Russian was just too hard?
The headline in the University of Washington Daily
said "May Day Violence Noted"; the stoiy underneath
it explained that "a life-size plaster red bear placed
near the center of the quad was turned over and
jumped upon by a graduate student in languages, who
asked that his name not be used."
Maybe he realized that the action was a reflection
on his lack of a sense of humor. Some more of the
story:
"Come on," the irate student said as lie stomped off
one of the plaster legs of the bear. "Doesn't anybody
have the guts?"
"Don't you think it's a joke?" one student said.
"Well maybe—maybe some fraternity put it there,"
he commented as he took one last kick at the prostrate
bear.
In the background, a pink cardboard elephant ad
vertising the sophomore carnival leaned against a ma
drono tree —completely undisturbed.

Not just class honor, but sinus infections —or worse
were at stake in a frosh-soph tug-of-war held re
cently at the University of Oregon. The big pull was
to be held over the "storied and romantic" Mill race—
end according to a University doctor, the Millrace
v/as not just polluted, but "super-polluted."
The Millrace is a campus stream drawing water
from the Willamette River, which has been closed for
swimming for the past few years.
Only bright note for grim and determined upholders

of the tug tradition: u poll disclosed that several people
have gone swimming in the Millrace with no ill effects.
A Junior Weekend official commented that the pol
lution would add "realness" and spice to the tug. With,
no doubt, fiendish glee.

You've heard of colleges entering their queens in
national beauty contests, enrolling their publications
in national rating organizations, submitting their
scholastic averages to comparison with other schools;
but have you heard of a university entering its mas
