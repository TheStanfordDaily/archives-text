The Stanford International Relief
Organization is a veritable gold mine
for stamp collectors. Every day, let
ters from all parts of Europe and
Asia pour into its office in the IIR
building. There are letters from
people forced by circumstances to
ask lor food and clothing, and there
are letters of gratitude for packages
already received.
Letters requesting aid have been
received from many different people
—the pastor of a German parish, the
missionary at a Japanese orphanage,
the choir bishop of an Austrian
cathedral, and a worker in Amster
dam. The following letter was re
ceived recently from Greece:
Letter From Greece
"Most worthy gentlemen:
Greetings, 112 respectfully come to

write you because I have seen that
your philanthrcfcy has reached even
to this village and I beg of you if you
have any old clothes lying around
that you send them to me to fix up
for my children and I will be grate
ful forever. Of my children the eldest
is Elias George Anagnostopoulos who
is learning to be a barber; the sec
ond is Euthoumos George Anagnos
topoulos, 14 years of age and in the
fifth grade of school; the fourth is
Panayiotis George Anagnostopoulos,
9 years of age; and the fifth is Gia
nitsa Anagnostopoulos, who is 2 years
old. ,
"Please forgive me because of the
need when I see my children going
to school without clothes to the
grammar school of Itea, and because
I see them this forces me to become
a beggar.
1 greet you respectfully
Your unknown writer,
GEORGE ELIAS
ANAGNOSTOPOULOS
Village of Hagia Euthuniia,
Atnphissa, Parnassos."

studying at Stanford, from faculty
members, from Stanford students
who have returned from abroad, or

The Stanford International Relief
Organization is a veritable gold mine
for stamp collectors. Every day, let
ters from all parts of Europe and
Asia pour into its office in the IIR
building. There are letters from
people forced by circumstances to
ask lor food and clothing, and there
are letters of gratitude for packages
already received.
Letters requesting aid have been
received from many different people
—the pastor of a German parish, the
missionary at a Japanese orphanage,
the choir bishop of an Austrian
cathedral, and a worker in Amster
dam. The following letter was re
ceived recently from Greece:
Letter From Greece
"Most worthy gentlemen:
Greetings, 112 respectfully come to

write you because I have seen that
your philanthrcfcy has reached even
to this village and I beg of you if you
have any old clothes lying around
that you send them to me to fix up
for my children and I will be grate
ful forever. Of my children the eldest
is Elias George Anagnostopoulos who
is learning to be a barber; the sec
ond is Euthoumos George Anagnos
topoulos, 14 years of age and in the
fifth grade of school; the fourth is
Panayiotis George Anagnostopoulos,
9 years of age; and the fifth is Gia
nitsa Anagnostopoulos, who is 2 years
old. ,
"Please forgive me because of the
need when I see my children going
to school without clothes to the
grammar school of Itea, and because
I see them this forces me to become
a beggar.
1 greet you respectfully
Your unknown writer,
GEORGE ELIAS
ANAGNOSTOPOULOS
Village of Hagia Euthuniia,
Atnphissa, Parnassos."
