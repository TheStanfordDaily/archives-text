# Joffre Series With Cal Ends Debate Year
## 
### 
The ASSU Debate Society will
climax the year's activities at the
Joffre Debate to be held Tuesday
at the University of California.
The Joffre Debate is held annu
ally with California. Representing
Stanford this year will be Tom
Brand, Tom Armstrong, and Dick
Kelton. Two of them will team up
with one of Cal's entrants, while
two Cal students match up with the
third Stanford entrant. An individ
ual, not a team, wins the tourna
ment for his school.
The general topic for the tourna
ment will be "The French Position
in the Far East." Two and one-half
hours before the time of the debate,
the contestants will receive a spe
cific topic, based on the general sub
ject. Thus speakers will be judged
largely on their ability to speak ex
temporaneously.
Last year Dow Carpenter won the
tournament for Stanford. The se
ries now stands at 28 to 27, with
Stanford leading. Carpenter won
by edging out, California's Fred
Harvey. Harvey is entered again
this year for California.
The Joffre Medal, which is
awarded to the winning individual,
was presented to the American am
bassador to France by the Presi
dent of France, and came to Stan
ford and California representative?
from the State Department in 1917.
