# Papoose Nine Breezes Past Menlo Oaks, 10-5
## 
### 
A very inept Menlo JC baseball
team fell prey to the Stanford year
lings, 10 to 5, at the fresh diamond
yesterday afternoon.
The Oaks, as in last week's loss
to the frosh, continually threw the
ball where the players weren't and
again handed the Cardbabes the
victory.
Pitchers Ron Boyer and Warren
Bradford limited the Oaks to six
hits and were seldom in any great
danger. Stanford jumped to a 3 to 0
advantage in the third as second
baseman John Knoeppel received
life on an error, Boyer walked, and
third baseman Jim Harding chased

both across with a line drive double.
Captain-elect Jack Shepard muscled
out a single to score Harding.
The Cardbabes made it 4 to 0 in
the fourth as centerfielder A 1 Stel
lar provoked a walk from pitcher A 1
Talboy, was sacrificed to second by
| Koeppel, and wandered home on
j Boyer's screamer past second.
The curtain rings down on the
frosh season this Saturday when
the Cardbabes meet Vallejo High
School on the frosh diamond.
