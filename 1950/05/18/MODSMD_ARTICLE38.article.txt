# The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS
## Cardinal Golfers Rated as Underdogs In PCC So. Div. Tourney Here Today 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
The ninth annual PCC southern division golf tournament will
get underway at 8:30 this morning on the difficult, par 71 Stan
ford golf course. The tourney will run through Saturday afternoon.
The team championship will be decided in today's play. Each
of the four competing schools will enter six men in the 36-hole

medal play competition. The cham
pionship will be awarded to the
school with the lowest cumulative
score of its four lowest scoring men.
Bruins Favored
The UCLA Bruins are favored to
win their first championship. The
Bruins have run up 12 straight dual
match victories this season without a
defeat. Coach Vic Kelley's Bruins
boast an all-veteran team led by Bob
Morefield and Dick Runkle.
The Stanford Indians, who won
only one of four conference matches,
rate as second choice because the
tournament is being held on their
home course. The red-shirts gave
UCLA its toughest match this season
before losing out by two strokes on
the Bruins' Bel Air course.
Bud Moe, who has failed to win a
point in the conference dual matches,
will continue to play the top position
for Stanford. Moe has been working
hard all week in preparation for the
tournament, and he is expected to
come through with his best golf of
the season.
Wallace Moves Up
John Wallace will tee-off in the
second position for the Indians today.
Wallace has been the Indians' leading
point-getter this season, and his play
merits the jump from fifth spot.
Bob Crozier, all-University cham
pion, holds down the third spot. Cro
zier has not shot a bad round of golf
all season, and he is Stanford's main
hope for the individual crown. Cro
zier's 6(3 against San Jose State was
the best effort by a Stanford golfer
this season.
Sophomore Dick McElyea will con
tinue to play as Stanford's number
four man. McElyea is another con
sistent golfer, but he has been
plagued by many tough opponents
this season.
Knosher Had Ace
Transfer student Jack Knosher is
Stanford's fifth entrant. Knosher hits
the longest ball of any of the In
dians, and he scored the only hole
in-one made on the Stanford course
this year. He accomplished this on

the 17th hole during a practice round.
Veteran Dave Mitten rounds out
the Indian sixsome. A steady per
former, Mitten has scored many
points for the Indians this year.
The defending champions are the
USC Trojans, who are led by Leonard
Kennett. Kennett is the early favor
ite to grab individual honors. The
Trojans edged Stanford last year by
three strokes on their home course.
California is the tournament's dark
horse on the basis of its victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates.
USC won the first conference
championship in 1939, but since then
Stanford has nearly monopolized the
tournament. Indian teams have won
five times, and finished second the
other three. California won in 1940.
Individual Championship
The lowest 16 scorers in today's
play will tee-off tomorrow morning
for the individual match play cham
pionship. The individual play will
continue tomorrow afternoon and
Saturday morning, and the final
round will take place Saturday after
noon.
Don Schwab of California won the
championship last year. Kennett,
Crozier, Runkle, Morefield, and Don
Brunk of California are the out
standing hopefuls this year.
