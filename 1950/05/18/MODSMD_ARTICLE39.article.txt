# Netmen Take Pepperdine
## 
### 
In a snappy comeback from their
double loss over the weekend, the
Stanford tennis team whipped Pep
perdine College, 5-1, Tuesday.
The match was a quickie, as it
was scheduled the same day it was
played. Pepperdine was up for a
match with San Jose State, and
needed some practice. Coach Bugge
threw in a makeshift outfit against
the southern boys.
Ernie Du√üray won the top sin
gles from Mark Miller. Only singles
loss was by George Gentry. One
doubles team played for Stanford,
and Dena Brinkman - Dick White
won easily for another point.
All men played better brands of
tennis than they did losing to USC,
8-1, and UCLA~ 7-2.
