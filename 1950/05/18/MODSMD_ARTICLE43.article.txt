# BRADSHAW!!!
## ATO's Ruin Sig Nine, 3-0 
### 
Hits were harder to make than
gold out of lead yesterday as "Pis
tol" Jack Bradshaw ol ATO and
Ken LaCrosse of Sigma Chi hooked
up in a terrific pitching duel to
highlight in their first-round mural
playoff game. Jack's hard hopper
downed Ken's blazing fast ball, set
ting the Sigma Chi's down in a one
hit 3 to 0 shutout.
Both teams played professional
brand softball, except for two
lapses in the infield which spelled
the downfall of Sigma Chi.
The first occurred in the top of
the initial inning after Don Rich
ardson had beaten out a bunt to
open the ball game for ATO.
Dwight Bradshaw slammed a hard
bounder at shortstop Tom Ward,
which caromed by the latter into
left field for a safe hit. On the play
Richardson went to third and then
home to score as Ward muffed the
throw-in from the outfield.
Sigs Bungle
Then, in the top of the sixth in
ning with runners on second and
third, Jim Graham grounded out
short to first, one run crossing on
the play, and when first baseman
Don McComber threw into left field,
trying to pick off the runner at
third, the latter finished the scoring.
Bradshaw was most effective in
the third as he struck out Tom
Ward on six pitches, Tom Slater on
three, and Dave Taylor on three.
Bob Slobe got the only hit off him
in the fifth, a single into right field.
Bob went to third when an attempt
to pick him off sailed into the out
field, but died there as Bradshaw
struck out Don McComber and Tom
Ward to end the inning.
DU's Win
Taking the bull by the horns,
DU II downed El Toro 7 to 3 yester
day. In a see-saw battle DU pitch
er Tom Wood outlasted Toro hurler
Charley Metcalf. Toro grabbed an
early two-run elad, but in a wild
third DU scored five runs to ice the
! game.
