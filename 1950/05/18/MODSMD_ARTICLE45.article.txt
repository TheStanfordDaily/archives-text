# Three Hurlers Await Gael's Starting Nod
## 
### 
Who's going to pitch the big one
on Saturday?
That's the midweek mystery
which is causing most of the talk,
as Stanford's baseball Cards get i
ready to invade Moraga next Sat- |
urday with hopes of clipping St. j
Mary's for the third straight time |
and walking oil with the CIBA pen
nant.
Will it be Joe Chez, the league's j
leading hurler, already a two-time |
conqueror of the Gaels, and who has 1
never lost a game since coming to j
Stanford, but who worked a full
nine innings last Tuesday?
Or Jack Heinen?
Or will it be Jack Heinen, the
fireball right-hander, who saved the
first St. Mary's game, and who was
previously rated as the best chuck
er on the .squad, but who has had
two disastrous Saturdays in a row
at the hands of Santa Clara and ;
use?
Or will it be Dave Stott, the vet
eran relief artist, who has turned
in brilliant one- and two - inning
stints against almost every team in
the league, but who has yet to go j
the distance this season?
The answer will have important,
bearing on Stanford's first chance
for a California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association championship
in two decades.
Joe's Been Busy
It would seem that Chez, with j
seven wins without a loss in league
competition, should get the nod. But ;
Joe was working all the way on
Tuesday, was touched for 10 hits, i
and had to bear down in every in- J
ning except the fourth and ninth. I
The 9 to 4 win undoubtedly took a
lot out of him.
Big Jack Heinen is healthy, com- j
pletely rested, and should be leady I
! to repeat with his best performance |

since he set down UCLA with five
hits and nine strikeouts at the end
of April.


DAVE STOTT. with moxie, ex
perience. and several brilliant re
lief jobs behind him. may get the
starting call in next Saturday's
game of the two decades against
St. Mary's at Moraga.
