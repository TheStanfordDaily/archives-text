# ATLANTIC PACT CONFERENCE
## Ministers Organize Block Against Reds 
### 
LONDON, May 17 (AP) â€”The North Atlantic Pact nations set up
a new executive agency tonight and instructed it to weld the
armies and economies of the Western World into a bulwark
against Communist aggression.
The foreign ministers of the 12 Pact nations decided they

needed a strong directing group in
continuous session to make sure that
both military and economic chiefs of
the members act swiftly and de
cisively.
The new group, made up of men
with the status of deputy foreign
ministers, probably will choose its
own head man. This over-all com
mander is almost certain to be an
American, in view of the United
States' leadership and contributing
to the alliance.
Speculation among diplomats here
centered on the name of W. Averell
Harriman, ambassador-at-largc for
the Marshall Plan.
There was general reluctance
among official spokesmen to single
out candidates for the post, but all
agreed the new executive must have
a strong personality and be able to
get things done in a hurry.
The foreign ministers announced
they had completed consideration of
the conflicting reports of their de
fense and economic committees and
"unanimously adopted directives to
guide these committees in their
work."
Defense Time Schedule
The military chiefs had urged a
big rearmament program.
The foreign ministers, in issuing
fresh instructions to these groups,
left to the new agency the actual de
cisions on a time schedule for de
fense, the amount of money needed
and how the costs arc to be allotted.
A United States spokesman said
the results of the three days of dis
cussions were "very satisfactory."
The U.S. delegation came to the
meeting hoping to impress their Eu
ropean allies with the need for
greater efforts in both military and
economic fields.
The specific details of the ministers'
decision, reached by unanimous
agreement, will be announced to
morrow. The ministers will hold a
final closed session and then a public
meeting, at which each of the 12 will
speak.
The new group will be a sort of
general headquarters.
Military Specialization
Its organization and function have
already been dccidcd, but details arc
being withheld until the ministers in
form their governments. Aside from
the United States and Canada, the
Pact nations arc Britain, France,
Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Portugal, Norway,
Denmark, and Iceland.
