### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Hap Black took individual honors
at the student-faculty quiz show
last night, edging Dr. Thomas Bai
ley by a score of 12 to 10. The fac
ulty team, comfortably tilted back
in their chairs, overwhelmed the
more dignified students, 38 to 25,
before an audience of 500 students.
Tied for third place with nine
points apiece were Dr. Cyril Means,
who won applause for giving the
previous names of bars along El
Camino, and Dr. Virgil Whitaker,
who starred in identifying famous
love aflairs.
Questions ranged from the names
of soap operat; to modern baseball
players, famous popes, and unnatu
ral phenomena occurring in poetry.
In the category of historical dates.
Hap Black insisted that August 28,
1928, was vital because it. was his
birthday. Dr. Bailey contended that
the signing of the Kellogg-Biiand
peace pact was more important.
Quizmaster Dow Carpenter refused
to give either side credit. The only
acceptable answer, he said, was that
it was the date of Dr. Bailey's mar
riage.
The only argument of the evening,
came when Hap Black and Dr.
Whitaker disputed the authorship
of "Beyond the Horizon." Lloyd
Combs settled the dispvitc from the
audience. The audience scored two
more victories over the stumped
contestants when Annekc Saunders
named the painting of Leonardo Da
Vinci now in London, and James
DoCu named the man responsible for
psycho-biology.
The professors declined to answer
a question directed to them from
Senator Joseph McCarthy, asking
"whether you are now or at any
time have been a member of the
Communist party."
