# SPRING SHOW
## War Farce Wins Praise 
### 
Good songs, funny lines, good sets, j
and some very nice bits of acting add j
up to a fiine Spring Show Ram's;
Head put out this ear.
Mort Zieve directed the show.
Norman Wexler and Bill Dailey
wrote the script, and Wexler and
Zieve did the music.
The music is one of the best fea- j
lures of the show. ' Mind of My Own"
and "Away From You" are two of
the best, with King Priam's catchy
theme song, "i Love People," close
behind.
Some of the best performances i
were turned in by Frank Wolff, Tom |
Shipp, Bill Harley, and Kay Lloyd.
WolfT is up to his usual standard
as Agamemnon, the conniving leader
of the Greeks. By dint of brains and
a lot of brass, he manages to con
tinue a phony war with Troy for 10
years.
In addition to his official duties-'!
with the army, he is able to take in
an enormous take a.s manager of the
Hotel Zeus (complete with elevator,
revolving door, and room service)
and his other sideline, local manager
for "Chariot Trader Ed." Tom Shipp j
plays his pocket-picking sidekick, j
the Oracle of Delphi.
One of the best characterizations is 1
by Kay Lloyd, who plays gawky,
domineering Queen Hecuba. Bill
Harley portrays King Priam as a
bumbling Casper Milquetoast who j
gels browbeaten hy everybody. His !
rendition of "I Love People" (but I
people don't love me)" was one of !
the high points of the show.
Dick Davis' performance as Ajax,
Agamemnon's halfwitted bodyguard,
is another bright spot in the show. !
Dad Rango (Dick Cox) of Gaieties
fame, reappears as Dad Edipus, to do i
the commercial for the H. V. Spar- i
tanborn newscast.
Credit should go, too, to Dick Cas- i
lor and Dick Hay for some very good t
sets and technical direction.
All in all, "Who Calls II War!" pro
vides a very entertaining evening, |
quite worth the time and money.
