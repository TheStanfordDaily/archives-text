# TWO QUARTERS
## Code Violator Found Guilty 
### 
A married veteran was suspended
from school for two quarters last
week when the Council for Stu
dent Control found him guilty of
violating the Honor Code.
He will be allowed to finish his
work this quarter, but will get an
F in the biology course in which he
cheated.
The lengthy hearing in this case
dragged on for four and a half
hours. It was 12:30 a.m. when sen
tence was finally read, and five wit
nesses plus the suspect appeared
before the Council during the ses
sion.
A deliberate attempt to catch the
student in the act of cheating led to
the case being brought before the
Council. i j.
Crili Notes
During a winter quarter final, an
other student noticed the veteran
using crib notes. He did not turn
him in.
However, when these same two
students were enrolled in another
class this quarter, the aid of a grad
uate student in the Biology Depart
ment was enlisted to check up on
the veteran during a midterm.
The graduate sat directly behind
the suspect, and according to his
testimony, the suspect glanced ei
ther to his left or right 152 times in
55 minutes. The glances ranged up
to 8-10 seconds, he said.
When test papers were compared
following the exam, a marked simi
larity was noted in the papers of
the suspect and the students to his
immediate left and right.
According to the instructor, there
were only two possible explana
tions: very intensive preparation
together, or deliberate cheating.
Studied Together
The two students whose papers
were copied told the Council that
they often studied with the guilty
student and that he always saved
scats for them in the classroom.
Both were absolved of blame.
When the seemingly overwhelm
ing evidence was read to the sus
pect, he denied each accusation, and
then set the stage for a long night
of charges and countercharges by
claiming that the whole case was a
framcup.
He alleged that perhaps he was
being framed because of a jealousy
between the graduate student who
watched him cheat and himself.
This was denied by the graduate.
The suspect explained his version
of the test similarities by the fact
that the three students had studied

together.
As for the glances, lie claimed
that lie was nervous and looked -il
a small clock repeatedly during (lie
test. He denied he had ever used
crib notes.
At 11:30 p.m., the course instiw
tor was routed out of bed in his
Palo Alto home by Council member
Sam Halstcad in an effort to self Id
a discrepancy in testimony.
The suspect swore the clock wa â– 
in the room the entire hour; one
witness thought the clock had been
put in the room only at the close of
the hour. The instructor said tha'
the clock had definitely been their
the whole time, and so tlie deadlock
continued.
At 12:15 a.m. the Council voled
8-1 to find the student guilty mid
15 minutes later sentence whs pro
nounced.
