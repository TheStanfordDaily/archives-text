### 

MRS. MARGARET HILDEBRAND cradles her 14-month-old baby
as her 4-year-old daughter, Joan, sits beside her in a rescue boa!.
Mrs. Hildebrand looks across the flood waters of the Red River
of the North, near Morris, Man., at her inundated home. The
Hood claimed all of the Hildebrand's possessions. In the back
ground is an unidentified Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
