### 
A political and cultural history of
Germany entitled "Germany: 2,01)0
Years," written by Dr. Kurt Rein
hardt, professor of history, was re- I
leased by the Bruce Publishing Com- I
puny of Milwaukee this week.
The work, a 780-page book which i
traces Germany's history from its I
early beginnings to the fall of the
Weimar Republic, is the fruit of 20 !
years of study and research by Dr. 1
Reinhardt.
On the thesis that "the character j
of a nation shapes its destiny," he i
seeks to interpret Germany's present ,
and future through a study of its I
past. Since Germany is l 'a complex ,
entity," maintains the author, "it can
be analyzed, evaluated, and under
stood only as i!. displays itself in the

process of historic evolution."
Born in Germany and educated at
the Universities of Munich, Heidel
berg, and Freiburgh, Dr. Reinhardt
has a first-hand acquaintance with
his subject.
He was an active member of the
German Centrist Party and head of
a famous publishing house. In l!) 2. r t

he founded and edited an illustrated
weekly which was banned by Nazi
ctnsorship and resurrected after the
fall of the dictatorship.
In Munich, he was a director and
actor with the Little Theater move
ment in Germany.
Since his arrival in America, Dr.
Reinhardt has distinguished himself
as a historian and philosopher. He
has written articles, pamphlets, and
several significant books, among
which is "A Relaistic Philosophy."
Me is also recognized nationally as
an author, teacher, publisher, lec
turer, and foreign correspondent.
For some time, he has been active in
university extension work, teaching
philosophy.
Dr. Reinhardt's comprehensive
portrait comes at a time of great cri
ses in Germany. "Past and present,
tradition and progress," he says,
"seem to meet in the form of an open
challenge which has to be accepted
and comprehended in the interest of
the welding process of a future Ger
many.'
