Seashells on the seashore may be
a tongue-twister to the average lay
man, but to a conchologist, or stu
dent of shells, they can mean indi
cations of the marine life of the pres
ent or to the geologist important
links with the past.
The Stanford Geology Depart
ment's sea shell collection was be
gun in 1892 by Professor J. C. Bran
ner, head of the Geology Department
at that time, and Dr. James Perrin
Smith, paleontologist here, through
the purchase of the Annie Law col
lection of marine and land shells.
Dr. Myra Keen has continued the
exhibition of the collection which in
cludes specimens from private con
tributions, University purchases, and
student collections.
The collection is divided into the
various groupings of molluscs and
seashell study. One case shows the
distribution of land snails over the
entire world, including the Triton's
Horn shell which is reported to be
used as a "teakettle" in the South
Seas.
The specimens range in size from
minute, almost grain-sized shells
clearly visible only with a mugni

lying glass to the giant of-all mol
lusks, the 300-pound clam which
feeds on microscopic plants grow
ing in clusters in the soft tissue of
the living clam.
From a 1941 Stanford expedition
to Punta Pensco, Mexico, are starfish
and corals exhibited as examples of
warm-water invertebrates. Also on
exhibit are the various shells found
in San Francisco Bay, Half Moon
Bay, and Monterey Bay, resembling
to an eye unschooled in conchology
Chinese coolie hats, sombreros, mina
ture screws, and pleated skirts.
Perhaps a fact little known to most
Stanford students is the existence of
the Stanford Eocene Pearl, which
was discovered in 1916, lodged with
a specimen brought to Stanford from
Washington in 1911. Dating from 50
to 00 million years ago, it is about 4
millimeters in diameter, and is pre
served in a special case which can be
inspected udoii request. .
