# Bring Home the Bacon
## 
### 
It'i; been a long, long time ... 19 years, to
Ie exact . . . since a Farm baseball club has
won a CIBA championship.
As a matter of fact, the 1950 pennant isn't
<i uirill the way in Coach Everett Dean's bag
yel. Hut the odds look good.
II !hc Cards perform according to expecta
tions tomorrow against the St. Mary's Gaels,
they'll tun up a season's-end record of 10 CIBA
wins against live losses ... an enviable tally
lor any club.
A win tomorrow will cinch a first-place lie
with IJSC, and toss the Deanmen into a sudden
death playoff with the Trojans. That is, there'll
be ri playoff if SC wins today against the Gaels

and also tomorrow against Cdl,
Tomorrow's crucial lilt is across the bay in
Moraga, and there may not be a very sizeable
chunk of Card rooters in the stands. So this is
a sort of "good luck" editorial, to the tone of
"Bring Home the Bacon."
The odds are on the board, and the safe bets
aic o*i Everett Dean, Dave Melton, Charlie Cole,
Dick Clegg, Tom Shaw, Bruce Cameron, Jim
Trabucco, John Claypool, Jim Castagnoli, Bill
Herron, Joe Chez, Jack Heinen, and Dave Stott.
The CIBA pennant would look mighty good
to us, after the many years of absence, and
we'd like it to be the climax ol Coach Dean's
first season with the Stanford nine.
