To I He Editor:
On April 12, Donald E. Close wrote to The Daily in
answer to a letter written by Gil Jonas. The issue
was v/lia 1 happened at the meeting in which the Cali
fornia Legislature decided to retract its stand sup
porting world government.
The Stanford Chapter of the National Association for
I tin Advancement of Colored People is mainly con
cerned with remarks made by Mr. Close on the sub
ject of racial equality.
We felt*that Mr. Close was misinformed when he
made the following statement: "that Howard Univer
sity . . . teaches its students that white people de

scended from Negroes. . . Although wr wore sure
Mr. Close was mistaken, we wrote Howard University
for clarification.
Howard University sent the following reply: "Please
be advised that Howard University teaches no anti
racial or religious doctrines. Howard University docs
not teach its students that white people descended
from Negroes."
We doubt that Mr. Close would find a scientific basis
for his statement, also in the above-mentioned letter
to The Daily, that racial equality is "bunk." We
wonder on what has basis for such a statement is
founded.
