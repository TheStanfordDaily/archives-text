You may be driving a car with a
1 ijinpletely new type of engine in
the future, a.s the result of prelimi
nary woi k being done here on the
can 1 pus.
Stanford's Professor Alexander L.
London of the Mechanical Engi
neering Department has gained
widespread national recognition
lately for his work done in testing
.1 free-piston diesel engine.
Although the particular engine
with which London is working was
designed for use as a torpedo-
I.lunching air compressor on a Ger
man submarine, he says that its
por ibilities for practical applica
tion in other fields are almost limit
less.
A new type of crankless engine
which runs well on low-grade oil,

using hot gases to turn ;i turbiiie,
might lie made practical in sizes
ranging from that of an automobile
engine tip to the largest diesel.
"The free-piston engine develop
ment is revolutionary," says 1.011-
don, "not only because of its in
crease in efficiency, but also because
it is much simpler in design I ban
the standard internal combustion
engine." Stanford engineers de
scribe the engine as light; it is in
expensive to build, operate, and
maintain.
An interesting feature of the en
gine in the Mechanical Engineering
Building is its freedom from vibra
tion. It is so vibration-free that a
coin can be balanced on edge on
the engine while it is in operation.
When speaking with London, it is
almost impossible to get him to talk
about himself, hut mention the
magic words "free - piston engine,"
and this, modest professor becomes
extremely enthusiastic.
"Biggest development in its field

sinee the interna! combustion m
gine," he says. Then, if you are
lucky, lie le;ids you through a large
room of machines and into his own
workshop ...
The first impression is one of
order and tidiness. The engine it
self is immaculate in its own cor
nor of the room, and all the w;dls
are painted in a neat battleship
gray. This is no accident; Profcssoi
London was on leave of absence
from I'll:', to '4(5, when he left Stan
ford to do special research for the
Navy. During this time, he was do
ing work on the development of
gas turbines for ship propulsion.
Both "Fortune" and "Diesel
Progress" magazines have published
articles on London's work in recent
issues. Some 80 or !)0 letters from
people interested in his field of
work are further testimony of the
importance attached to London's
contributions.
No wonder Professor London is
one of the youngest full professors
on the Stanford faculty!
