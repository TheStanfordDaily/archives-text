## 
### 
Mark Linenthal, Lois Deiinel,
Laurose Becker, and Herb KaufT
man will visit the UC campus to
morrow. They will investigate facts
and attitudes there concerning the
compromise on the non-Communist
oath.
These four represent a group
composed of about 20 members ol
the Stanford student body and
teaching staff. These persons met
Wednesday night and went on rec
ord as opposing political discrimina
tion in hiring and firing of em
ployees.
In a statement of their views they
said:
. . we arc opposed to spccial
oaths and to special conditions lor
employment based on considera
tions other than professional com
petence and ability.
Employment Contracts
Linenthal read a resume of the
published facts concerning the Cal
compromise. Instead of taking the
oath originally proposed by the
Board of Regents, UC faculty mem
bers must now sign employment
contracts with the following clause:
"Having taken the constitutional
oath of office required by public of
ficials of the State of California, 1
hereby formally acknowledge my
acceptance of the position and sal
ary named and also state that I am
not a member of Ihe Communist
party or any other organization
which advocates the overthrow of
the government by force and vio
lence, and have no commitments in
conflict with my responsibilities
with respect. In impartial scholar
ship and free pursuit nl truth. I un
derstand thai Ihe foregoing state
ment is a condition of said employ
ment."
Members of the Stanford group,
according Hi moderator Timmy Le
vison, felt that this was a case of
political discrimination and con
trary lo Ihe principles of academic
freedom. In the statement fornni

lated at tlic meeting they staled:
"Compromise Is Alarming"
"We view tlie 'compromise* at (lie
University of California with alarm.
Academic freedom is impon .nt not
only for its benefits to professors
and students, hut to the society as
a whole, and we are determined
that it be defended."
After talking with members of
the UC faculty tomorrow the four
students hope to have some fur
ther information to report to Stan
ford students. The group hopes to
use this information as the basis for
some concrete action to better the
situation.
A meeting will be held next Tues
day evening where the four stu
dents visiting Cal tomorrow will re
port.
