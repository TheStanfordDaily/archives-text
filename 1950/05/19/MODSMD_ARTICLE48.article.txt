JOHN WEYLAND, 22, is obviously in despair over the fact that
after being chosen "Ugliest Man" of the University of California
on the campus at Berkeley, he still finds his charm irresistible
to women. Roberta Blough, 22 (left), last year's Homecoming
Queen and' Nancy Larsen, 18, new sweetheart of Sigma Chi,
make him a marked man. Weyland was sponsored by Kappa
Delta Sorority. â€”AP Wirephoto
