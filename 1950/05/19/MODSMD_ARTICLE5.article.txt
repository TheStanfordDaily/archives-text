# Heroes' Welcome
## 
### 
TAIPEI, Formosa â€” The Chinese
Nationalists went all out today to
give a heroes' welcome to the troops
withdrawn from the Chushan Is
lands.
Even hard-boiled old China hands
who saw the withdrawal as the next
to the last step to the end confessed
admiration for the skill with which
it was executed from start to finish.
