# Card Nine Plays in Pennant Payoff Tomorrow
## Gaels Only Block On Victory Path; Trojans Can Still Gain Tie For Title 
### JOHN HALL 
Still a half-game on top of the most scrambled pannant struggle in CIBA history, Stanford rides
into its 1950 finale against St. Mary's tomorrow wiih three other teams breathing down its neck and
battling for a title that won't be decided until the final out.
For Stanford, with nothing left to do but shoot the works, and for USC, the other team voted most
likely to succeed, all roads lead to Moraga, with St. Mary's and the key to the championship wait

i ing there at the end of the path.
First Crack
Troy tries first, today at 3:15 in the
j Moraga pasture, and then has to fol
low up with another win against
California at Berkeley tomorrow.
Getting all the best of it, Stanford
lias to work only once, tomorrow at
2:30. Admission to students will be
free.
The Cards are just one game away
from cinching at least a tie for their
first baseball crown in two decades,
and should USC stumble either day,
they will walk uncontested.
Everett Dean stated again yester-
I day that every pitcher on his stafi
"on down to JV Tony Stellar has |
| been brought along with this one I
game in mind."
"Five different pitchers will be on |
call," said Dean, who with Dutch j
| Fehring, Ray Hammett, arrd Bob
Burnett, has been considering every j
I factor in naming a starter.
Who Will Start?
Right now it looks as if the fire
ball right-hander, veteran Jack Hei- ;
i nen, with a season record of 2 wins |
: and 5 losses, will get the opening j
i nod. After Heinen, if need be; Chez,
I Stott, and Claypool will work in that
j order. This is one time they won't j
! be sparing the horses.
Heinen has already worked once
J against the Gaels, turning in an ef-
I fective relief job in Moraga last
j month when Stanford St.
1 Mary's, 7 to (5. to take over the league
! lead.
Should Stanford and USC both lose I
a game, the league could wind up in

a three- or four-way tie with Santa
Clara or California, or both—it's that
close. Santa Clara would have to
knock ofl UCLA today and tomor
row in Los Angeles, and the Bears
need wins over USC tomorrow and
over St. Mary's in an as yet unsched
uled replay of an earlier tie.
The Tribe figures to run right back
into the familiar slants of Ken Fi
gueroid who worked again.st them
for seven innings last Tuesday, as
the Gaels will probably use their
ace Carroll Can field and Pack Piek
art this afternoon against Troy.
Only one starting position, the |
right field slot, is in doubt, and il will
be a last-minute tossup between
senior John Claypool and Jungle Jim

Trabuceo.
Otherwise, it'll be the same club
which has twice previously whacked
St. Mary's.
Percentages favor the Cards. They
go into tomorrow's crucial with the
strongest sticks they've swung thi:;
season.
Four Over ..*lOO
Four different men -Charlie Cole,
Dave Melton, Bud Klein, and Dick
Clegg—are massaging the ball over a
..'iOO clip. And the club's two clutch
drivers — Bruce Cameron and Tom
Shaw—raised their marks to almost
that point by walloping their favorite
cousins, the Gaels, last time out.
The hurling department, too, with ]
the CIBA's best hurler, 7 and oh Joe
Chez, ready in reserve, gives Stan- |
ford the lean.
Enthusiasm on campus, quiet all
week in spite of the Indians' chances
for a (ir.~,t big championship since
1!)42, was beginning to pick up last
night.
Way to (Jo
Several of those roads leading toi
Moraga tomorrow may be specked i
with Card rooters. According to As- J
sistant Director of Athletics Don
Liebendorfer, the best way to get to !
Moraga is up Bayshore Highway, I
over the Bay Bridge, take Mac Arthur
to the Tunnel, and follow the signs.
The Cards went through a snappy
fielding arid hitting drill late yester
day afternoon, and will follow up
with more of the same today. They 1
board a chartered bus at 10 tomor
row morning to start the 45-mile
drive.
And ihere you have it. The Cards
will be working for their tenth CIBA
victory, a series sweep over St.
Mary's, and their first championship
since young Harry Wolters guided
them through the darkness, back in
1931.
