## Extra Events May Tap Out Trojans 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
The chips wi'l be down this
weekend fur Stanford's vn»\s tv
j swimming team, as they engage in
the Southern Division, FCC, e< n
j ference swim mini? meet Friday an.J
I Saturday at Berkeley.
Although they lost to USC' in a
dual meet, 50 to 25.the Indians
have a very good chance (•*> win,
and are regarded as favorites in
i many quarters.
The reason for this change ,of
I form is that there ore three extra
I events, the 1(10 - yard breastslroke
and backstroke, and the 150-yard
individual medley, in which Stan
lord figures to score heavily. Also,
relays will be scored 10-8-G-4, in
stead ol the all-or-nothing method
tn dual meets.
Doped out, the meet lie nres to
he close between Stanford and
USC at NO points; UCLA third
with about 35 joints, mainly on
the strength of sprinter Don
Smith, who has done 51 .!) in the
100 - yard freestyle, and hreast
stroker Monte Nit/owski. who
does about 2:27 for the 200-yard
event; and Cal fourth with close
! to 25 points.
SC's star is Wally Wolf, who
swims any stroke, but will concen
j Irate on the 220 and 440 freestyle
j and 100-ynrd backstroke. V/o!l was
; on the relay team that set a new
j Olympic Games record in 11)48.
Stanford should score heavily in
the distance events and the individ
ual medley. In the 220, Ralph Sala
and Pete Cole did 2:14 last week in
the fog at Berkeley, and John
j Mowat did 2:14 the week before,
j These same three have broken five
I minutes in the 440, i;nd smooth -
I stroking Ernie Polte has done !".>:()!!.
| Two weeks ago, swimming a
time trial in practice, Bruce Pitl
• nam and Bob Frojen rMd I and
1:34 in the three - stroke event.
This compares very favorably
with VVallv Wolf's time of 1:217
which won the meet last year,

RALPH SALA, NCAA 440 tank champion, will meet the Trojans'
sensational Wally Wolf once again tomorrow. This time the
occasion will be the Pacific Coast, Southern Division, cham
pionships at Berkeley. The Trojans are favored to repeat last
year's win, but the Sala-led Indians may have an outside chance
with the addition of two events.
