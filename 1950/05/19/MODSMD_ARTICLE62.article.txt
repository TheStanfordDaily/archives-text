# Netmen Meet State, Bears; Close Season
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Coach Elwyn Bugge will send his weakened, hot-and-cold var
sity tennis team into their final weekend of competition. Today the !
Indians meet San Jose State on the home courts. Tomorrow it is
the Cal Bears at Berkeley.
The Spartans, who will appear on the courts starting at 1:30 p.m.,

are i'resh l'rorn winning the California ►
Collegiate Athletic Association cham
pionship. San Jose defeated Pepper
dine, 6 to 3, Wednesday for the loop
title.
State's top singles ace was extended
to beat the Peps' Marshall Miller, who
earlier this week lost to Stanford's
Ernie Dußray. Comparatively speak
ing, Butch Kirkorian of San Jose
should be no match for Kirke Me
chem, who plays number one ahead
of Dußray.
Close Tiff
The California matches appear
much closer. In the first meeting, the
Indians easily put away the Bears, 7
to 2. But since then, the varsity has j
lost the services of top doubles and
singles ace Lucien Barbour. Also, i
the Cards were all playing good ten
nis. Now they are unpredictable.
Mechem will again get a tough time j
of it when he laces top-flight Loren
Main, Canadian Davis Cup ace. Kirke !
has yet to win a conference singles
match, but has been battling stars j
like Herbie Flam and Earl Coehell. j
This could be his chance for an up- j
set.
Cellar for Who?
The Bears will be battling to .stay I
out of the cellar, and with a win over
the Cards, could pull the locals into j
a tie for the bottom spot. Both teams j
have dropped pairs to SC and UCLA, j
California singles entries will be, i
in order, Main, Waily McDonald, Don j
Menke, Chuck Curry, Captain Mor- I
rill Albert, and Cameron Fair. Dou- :
ties combinations will be Main-Mc- '
Donald, Menkc-Len Warren, and
Curry-Albert.
For the Indians, besides Mechem,
it will be Ernie Dußray, George
Gentry, Tow Lewyn, Vince Schmei
der, and Dean Brinkman. Coach
Bugge is not sure of his doubles
teams.
The Stanford Papooses will appear
in a preliminary to the Berkeley
matches. Previously blasted, (! to 3,
the frosh will be out for a revenge
win. The two top men, Bob Sibert
and Charlie Hickcx, were the only
point-winners in the last outing. !
