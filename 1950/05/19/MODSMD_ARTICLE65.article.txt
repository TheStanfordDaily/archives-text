# Farm Professor May Have First Discovered X-Rays
## 
### 
Pictorial evidence has been pre
sent "d Stanford University which
appear:- to substantiate the sugges
tion of I in: Stanford Alumni Review
that a Stanford professor was the
discoverer of X-rays.
The yi ft, five pictures of ob'ccts
photographe:.l through solid mate
rial, was presented by Mrs. L. H.
Gihnore ol Pasadena, wife of a
Stanlord graduate and former in
stnu I'n who later became a physics
professor at the California Institute
of Technology.
The photographs were taken by
Gihnore, who died last summer,
while serving here as an instructor
in 1894-95 under Professor Fer
nando Sanford. At. that time, Dr.
Sanford was experimenting with
electricity in photography.
One of the pictures shows the dis
tinct outline of a silver dollar pho
tographed through the side of a
purse and the rubber slide of the
photo plate holder. Two others
show a clearer image of a dollar
taken through the slide holder
alone. One photograph showed a
distorted substance while the fifth
distinctly showed a key and coins
taken through the pages of a maga
zine.
Letlrrs and Article
The pictures bore no other de
scription of the experiments, but
kttr::: lrom alumni and an article
from ; n early San Francisco Exam
iner, reprinted in the Alumni Re
view, east an interesting light on
Professor Sanford's experiments.
The discovery of X-rays is cred
ited to Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen, a
German physicist, who announced
his discovery late in 1895.
Professor Sanford was a member
of the Old Guard, the first group of
professors to come to Stanford. His
death in May, 1343. brought a letter
to the Alumni Review from Mrs.
Harold Heath, '94. describing some
of the professor's experiments.
Mrs. Heath, the former E'sie
Shelley, told how she entered the

physics lab one day in 1894 and
found Dr. Sanford in great excite
ment. The professor told her that
by accident he had left the photo
graphic lens of his camera uncov
ered and the last of the plates ready
for exposure. Upon developing it,
he found the plate a blank except
for the image of a pin.
Pin in Drawn-
Finding no pin in sight, he opened
the drawer of his desk and found
it, indicating that the camera had
taken the picture through the
wooden top of the desk. He experi
mented further with a key in a
purse, and sent his findings to a sci
entific magazine. The story was re
turned with the curt reply that the
magazine did not publish '"fairy
talcs."
The incident discouraged SanfoH
from writing any more articles on
his experiments, despite the urging
of his friends,
However, a report of Dr. San
ford's published earlier in the first
edition of the "Physical Review" of
1894 showed that Sanford beÂ«an his
experiments in electrical photogra
phy when Stanford opened in 1891
With an induction coil apparatus
he experimented with contact
printing. His findings, along with
a photographic reproduction, ap
peared in the San Francisco Exam
iner December 31, 1893.
Other Evidence
In another letter to the Alumni
Review, Arthur M. Cathcart, '96,
professor emeritus of law, said that
he knevv Sanford had been experi
menting with a vacuum tube and
induction coil, the two instruments
required for X-ray production.
Cathcart assumed that Sanford
could have produced the X-ray
while experimenting with these in
struments.
Watson Nicholson, '92. told of vis
iting Stanford late in 1893 or early
in 1894 at which time Sanford told
him of the experiments.
Dr. Kirkpatrick said also that Dr.

Sanford never talked about the
above-mentioned experiments or
made an v claims about X-rays in.
his latei years.
