be aplenty tonight as the eight Cards j
match strides and tosses with the best
the nation can offer.
, The eight Stanfords are scheduled
to enter only six of the 17 open events
in the Coliseum. Of the six—broad
jump, javelin, shot put, open 440, 440
relay, and 880 relay—the Cards can
be figured as favorites in but two,
the javelin and shot put.
Bud Held, Otis Chandler, and Lew
Davis could garner two firsts and a j
second here.

ran :41 at Fresno to beat a 10-year

world's record is :40.5.

Brothers Bryan and Ronnie Buck in Stanford's 440-yard relay
team tonight in the Los Angeles Coliseum Relays. Taylor will
also run a lap of the 880-yard relay. Then he will go it all over
