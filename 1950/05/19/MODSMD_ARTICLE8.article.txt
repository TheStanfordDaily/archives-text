be aplenty tonight as the eight Cards j
match strides and tosses with the best
the nation can offer.
, The eight Stanfords are scheduled
to enter only six of the 17 open events
in the Coliseum. Of the six—broad
jump, javelin, shot put, open 440, 440
relay, and 880 relay—the Cards can
be figured as favorites in but two,
the javelin and shot put.
Bud Held, Otis Chandler, and Lew
Davis could garner two firsts and a j
second here.
410 Relay Close
The Cards' 440 relay team, which
ran :41 at Fresno to beat a 10-year
school record of Clyde Jeffreys and
Co., will tangle with four of the na
tion's best. Rice is credited with a
:41.3 mark.
Texas, Oklahoma A&M, and USC
can be fiyured to be close in this race
—one which could find all five teams
finish in a near dead heat. The
world's record is :40.5.
Coach Jack Weiershauser will cn- I
ter Ronnie Buck, Wilbur Taylor, Bob
Bryan, and Gay Bryan. Pitch John
son will replace Buck in the 880-yard
relay.
Stanford tan 1:25.7 for a second
place in the longer event last week. |
Texas, anchored by the great Charlie j
Parker, has a 1:25.5 mark to its |
credit. Oklahoma A&M and South
ern California will be contenders |
here also.
Highlight of Season
Pitch John.son will enter the clas
siest field of his life when he matches
strides with Herb McKenley, world's
record holder of the 400-meter run,
Mai Whitfield, Bill Parker of Occi
dental. Eddie Macon of COP, anrl Bob
Roden of Morgan State. This race ■
will be the highlight of the American
track season.
Gay Brvan is scheduled for only |
one non-relay event — the broad |
jump. Here he will meet the nation's ;
best in Al Stanficld of Seton Hall, a
fellow traveler on the AAU European j
trip last summer, and Jack Voight of
Oklahoma A&M. Then too, the us-


WILBUR TAYLOR, he of "Stainless Steel" likeness, will join
Brothers Bryan and Ronnie Buck in Stanford's 440-yard relay
team tonight in the Los Angeles Coliseum Relays. Taylor will
also run a lap of the 880-yard relay. Then he will go it all over
again tomorrow night at Modesto's California Relays—plus a
lap of the mile relay. Truly a Stainless Steel performance.
ual USC and Cal nun are entered.
Ronnie Buck may find his way into
the open 100 if the relay events are
spaced far enough from the 100. Bob
Bryan will have to stay out of the
220 low hurdles for this event is run
too close to the 440 relay.
Pole vaulter Don Campbell will
not make the trip as he is a member
of the Spring Show.
Tomorrow morning the eight
tracksters and Weiershauser will
plane to Modesto to join the other lit
varsity members for the West Coast
Relays.
It is here that revenge will be
added to the honor and watch parade
as (he Cards will have a chance to i
reverse the USC win at Fresno.
However, it will be much harder
to score at Modesto than at Fresno,
for at this event the points are given
on a 5-3-2-1 basis instead of 5-4-3- !
2-1. So the premium is placed on
first places, what with the seconds
only counting three points.

The relay events are scored 10-fi
-4-2, against the 8-point second place
award given at Fresno.
Also, the club points will be
counted at Modesto. Thus neither
USC nor Stanford is expected to run
up a GO-point total as at Fresno. The
Olympic Club and Los Angeles A C.
will cut into the points of both
schools.
Some of the schools competing in
the Coliseum are expected to move
on to Modesto, so that field will be
of a higher caliber than Fresno.
Schools such as Michigan State and
Oklahoma A&M will cut down on
USC's points in the mile, two-mile,
and two-mile lelay.
Then too, such individual perform
ers as Stanlield and Voight and John
McGrew of Rice, will cut down on
Stanford's chances in the I. road and
high jumps.
It is not yet known just what col
leges will move on to Modesto, so any
predictions as to point total would
be out of line.

be aplenty tonight as the eight Cards j
match strides and tosses with the best
the nation can offer.
, The eight Stanfords are scheduled
to enter only six of the 17 open events
in the Coliseum. Of the six—broad
jump, javelin, shot put, open 440, 440
relay, and 880 relay—the Cards can
be figured as favorites in but two,
the javelin and shot put.
Bud Held, Otis Chandler, and Lew
Davis could garner two firsts and a j
second here.
410 Relay Close
The Cards' 440 relay team, which
ran :41 at Fresno to beat a 10-year
school record of Clyde Jeffreys and
Co., will tangle with four of the na
tion's best. Rice is credited with a
:41.3 mark.
Texas, Oklahoma A&M, and USC
can be fiyured to be close in this race
—one which could find all five teams
finish in a near dead heat. The
world's record is :40.5.
Coach Jack Weiershauser will cn- I
ter Ronnie Buck, Wilbur Taylor, Bob
Bryan, and Gay Bryan. Pitch John
son will replace Buck in the 880-yard
relay.
Stanford tan 1:25.7 for a second
place in the longer event last week. |
Texas, anchored by the great Charlie j
Parker, has a 1:25.5 mark to its |
credit. Oklahoma A&M and South
ern California will be contenders |
here also.
Highlight of Season
Pitch John.son will enter the clas
siest field of his life when he matches
strides with Herb McKenley, world's
record holder of the 400-meter run,
Mai Whitfield, Bill Parker of Occi
dental. Eddie Macon of COP, anrl Bob
Roden of Morgan State. This race ■
will be the highlight of the American
track season.
Gay Brvan is scheduled for only |
one non-relay event — the broad |
jump. Here he will meet the nation's ;
best in Al Stanficld of Seton Hall, a
fellow traveler on the AAU European j
trip last summer, and Jack Voight of
Oklahoma A&M. Then too, the us-

ual USC and Cal nun are entered.
Ronnie Buck may find his way into
the open 100 if the relay events are
spaced far enough from the 100. Bob
Bryan will have to stay out of the
220 low hurdles for this event is run
too close to the 440 relay.
Pole vaulter Don Campbell will
not make the trip as he is a member
of the Spring Show.
Tomorrow morning the eight
tracksters and Weiershauser will
plane to Modesto to join the other lit
varsity members for the West Coast
Relays.
It is here that revenge will be
added to the honor and watch parade
as (he Cards will have a chance to i
reverse the USC win at Fresno.
However, it will be much harder
to score at Modesto than at Fresno,
for at this event the points are given
on a 5-3-2-1 basis instead of 5-4-3- !
2-1. So the premium is placed on
first places, what with the seconds
only counting three points.

The relay events are scored 10-fi
-4-2, against the 8-point second place
award given at Fresno.
Also, the club points will be
counted at Modesto. Thus neither
USC nor Stanford is expected to run
up a GO-point total as at Fresno. The
Olympic Club and Los Angeles A C.
will cut into the points of both
schools.
Some of the schools competing in
the Coliseum are expected to move
on to Modesto, so that field will be
of a higher caliber than Fresno.
Schools such as Michigan State and
Oklahoma A&M will cut down on
USC's points in the mile, two-mile,
and two-mile lelay.
Then too, such individual perform
ers as Stanlield and Voight and John
McGrew of Rice, will cut down on
Stanford's chances in the I. road and
high jumps.
It is not yet known just what col
leges will move on to Modesto, so any
predictions as to point total would
be out of line.
