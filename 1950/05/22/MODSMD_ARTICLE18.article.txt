# Farm Freshman 'Hits Silk' Again
## 
### 
It wasn't a man from Mars, it
wasn't a Commie, or a soldier lost
from the war games who floated
down to the campus Saturday
morning.
It was ex - paratrooper Bud
Nutting, a Stanford freshman,
who had an urge to "hit the silk"
again.
Nutting's feat was accomplished
more easily than that of the three
roughs who ran through a quar
ter mile of wasit-high oats near
Stern Hall to reach him.
The three were puffed up with
visions of broken legs, only to find
Nutting calmly unbuckling his
harness and worrying about the
rip - cord ring he had dropped
when he hit.
' The darn thing costs too much
to lose." he exclaimed.
The three hiked back through
the field, and Nutting rode away
in a jeep that had also arrived
the jumping urge out of his sys
tem.
