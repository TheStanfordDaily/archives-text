BULLETIN
In a special telephone interview to The Daily, DSC Coach Sain Ban.v
said last night that it was "a possibility" that USC would forego the PC*
playoff game with Northern Division Champions, Washington State, in fa
vor of Stanford. Barry added that, in liis opinion (as a member of th«-
NCAA Board), Stanford should have a right to play the Northern Di
vision Champion to determine who would represent District 8 (Pacific
Coast) in the national playoffs in .Inne, regardless of who played WSC
for the PCC title.
Barry, however, said that lie had not as yet conferred with the top
USC Athletic Department bosses, and that no official action had yet been
taken.

The California Intercollegiate Baseball Asociation was trembling
on its inadequate foundations today as a result of the Conference
ruling which has snubbed Stanford's league champs, and named
USC as the southern representative for the PCC playoffs next
weekend.
Stanford won undisputed rights to its first CIBA title in 19 yeai:;

" " I J
last Saturday at Moraga by knocking*
off St. Mary's, 4 to 2, while USC was
dropping its second game of the
weekend, this time to California, (i
to 5, at Berkeley.
The Cards finished with a 10 and ■> i
season record, a game and one -half |
ahead of second-place California, j
and two full games 111 front of the I
chosen Trojans.
But Troy, dropped into a third j
place tie with Santa Clara in the six- |
team CIBA, will play Washington
State in the playoffs because of Vic
tor Schmidt's statement that all
games with St. Mary's and Santa
Clara will not be counted toward I
PCC records.
Decided Last Year
The Conference officials decided
before last season that only games
against PCC opponents would be
counted in the win and loss records,
thus hoisting the Trojans into a tie
with Stanford at (i wins and .'} losses
each.
Because USC took 2 out of from
Stanford, the Trojans have been se
lected, the result of another new rul
ing which was designed early last
year to do away with CIBA playoffs.
Made known in the typical Victor
O. Schmidt manner, this weird twist
to the finish of the CIBA race was j
accepted with bitterness by the In- j
dian baseballers who did not hear of
it until after USC had already blown
its league chances by dropping a 1 to
2 decision to the Gaels on Friday.
Hurts CIBA
"This may be the end of Hie CIBA,"
voiced St. Mary's Coach Johnny Ver- I
gez, who thought the Indians were!
the logical team to pick. "We rould '
probably do better by forming a
league out of B>iy Area teams, in
cluding College of Pacifir, I'SF, and
San Jose State," Vergez added.
More dissatisfaction was expressed
by Art Reichele, UCLA headman,
who wired Everett Dean yesterday to
say that he believed Stanford is the
best team in the league and should be
its representative.
However, the Stanford Athletic
Department, refusing to take an im
mediate stand on the matter, stated
that it would "wait for further de
velopments" before taking a concrete
course of action.
