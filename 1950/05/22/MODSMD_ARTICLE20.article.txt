# Card Nine Snubbed as Third Place Troy Wins PCC Playoff Privilege
## Sam Berry Hints That USC May Bow to Indians Instead 
### 
BULLETIN
In a special telephone interview to The Daily, DSC Coach Sain Ban.v
said last night that it was "a possibility" that USC would forego the PC*
playoff game with Northern Division Champions, Washington State, in fa
vor of Stanford. Barry added that, in liis opinion (as a member of th«-
NCAA Board), Stanford should have a right to play the Northern Di
vision Champion to determine who would represent District 8 (Pacific
Coast) in the national playoffs in .Inne, regardless of who played WSC
for the PCC title.
Barry, however, said that lie had not as yet conferred with the top
USC Athletic Department bosses, and that no official action had yet been
taken.
By JOHN HALL
The California Intercollegiate Baseball Asociation was trembling
on its inadequate foundations today as a result of the Conference
ruling which has snubbed Stanford's league champs, and named
USC as the southern representative for the PCC playoffs next
weekend.
Stanford won undisputed rights to its first CIBA title in 19 yeai:;

" " I J
last Saturday at Moraga by knocking*
off St. Mary's, 4 to 2, while USC was
dropping its second game of the
weekend, this time to California, (i
to 5, at Berkeley.
The Cards finished with a 10 and ■> i
season record, a game and one -half |
ahead of second-place California, j
and two full games 111 front of the I
chosen Trojans.
But Troy, dropped into a third j
place tie with Santa Clara in the six- |
team CIBA, will play Washington
State in the playoffs because of Vic
tor Schmidt's statement that all
games with St. Mary's and Santa
Clara will not be counted toward I
PCC records.
Decided Last Year
The Conference officials decided
before last season that only games
against PCC opponents would be
counted in the win and loss records,
thus hoisting the Trojans into a tie
with Stanford at (i wins and .'} losses
each.
Because USC took 2 out of from
Stanford, the Trojans have been se
lected, the result of another new rul
ing which was designed early last
year to do away with CIBA playoffs.
Made known in the typical Victor
O. Schmidt manner, this weird twist
to the finish of the CIBA race was j
accepted with bitterness by the In- j
dian baseballers who did not hear of
it until after USC had already blown
its league chances by dropping a 1 to
2 decision to the Gaels on Friday.
Hurts CIBA
"This may be the end of Hie CIBA,"
voiced St. Mary's Coach Johnny Ver- I
gez, who thought the Indians were!
the logical team to pick. "We rould '
probably do better by forming a
league out of B>iy Area teams, in
cluding College of Pacifir, I'SF, and
San Jose State," Vergez added.
More dissatisfaction was expressed
by Art Reichele, UCLA headman,
who wired Everett Dean yesterday to
say that he believed Stanford is the
best team in the league and should be
its representative.
However, the Stanford Athletic
Department, refusing to take an im
mediate stand on the matter, stated
that it would "wait for further de
velopments" before taking a concrete
course of action.
As disappointed as his players as
he walked back If) the Moraga locker

! rooms after winning the CIBA crown
j ui his first year as bead coacn. I'.v
J erett Dean remarked, "Wei!, we've
won the pennant, now what can w
do with it?"
There didn't, appeal to be an im
mediate answer. Stanford bad
hanked everything on beating S*
Mary's aaid earning the right to com
pete in the national championship
Veteran Dave Stott, a surprise
starter on Saturday, responded
a masterful four-hit shutout I t
seven innings before he tired an'l
had to get help from fireball Jack
j Heinen.
Heinen came to the rescue with
the sacks loaded in the eighth wilh
only one down, and after giving up •<
two-run double, he settlea tlown to
strike out the side.
Early Lead
Stanford worked Ken Figeroid for
nine hits, mostly in the opening
frames, to give Stott a nice cushion
of four early runs. Dick Clegg's sin
gle, Tom Shaw's darting triple to
right, and a passed ball produced two
Card runs in the second.
A Dave Melton double and a Cleg>
triple netted another in the third,
and a walk to Bill Herron, a sacri
fice by Stott, and Chuck Cole's safety
to center brought iu Stanford's final
tally in the fourth.
Continuing to paste their Gael
cousins, Tom Shaw and Bruce Cam
eron again led Stanford sticks with
two hits each, this time l>eing joined
by Dick Clegg with another pair.
Clegg also had n great day in the
field, going high in the air on three
different plays to spear wild pegs
and turn errors into putouts.
"Wasn't that a sweet infield out
there today," remarked Dutch Feh
ring just after Jack Heinen had
struck out Duane Kling to end the
game. And then thinking about USC
squeezing into the playoffs on a fluke,
he added, "It's a shame such a rule
could exist in the first place. I wish
they had told us this before the USC
series two weeks ago."
No Statement Yet
The CIBA, presided over by Cali
fornia's Clint Evans this season, has
taken the same stand as Stanford's
Athletic Department — that is, no
statement until further develop
ments.
It was hoped that Sam Barry, the
USC headman, would not accept the
bid in favor of the CIBA winner,
which would certainly have strength
ened the league which he himself

helped to form, and gained back some \
of the friends USC lost at the Fresno
Relays.
Meanwhile, the Stanford ballplay
ers could do nothing but wait for I
those further developments. Co- j
captain Charlie Cole summed up their '
position when he stated, "I think the
CIBA has proved itself to he the best |
college baseball league in the conn- \
try, I think we won it, and I think
we deserve something for it."
As it stands, the Indians will meet '
USF on the Sunken Diamond tomor
row and then will finish the season
next Saturday against the Alumni on
the same field, while USC takes on
Washington State in the north:

strike out the side.
Early Lead
Stanford worked Ken Figeroid for
nine hits, mostly in the opening
frames, to give Stott a nice cushion
of four early runs. Dick Clegg's sin
gle, Tom Shaw's darting triple to
right, and a passed ball produced two
Card runs in the second.
A Dave Melton double and a Cleg>
triple netted another in the third,
and a walk to Bill Herron, a sacri
fice by Stott, and Chuck Cole's safety
to center brought iu Stanford's final
tally in the fourth.
Continuing to paste their Gael
cousins, Tom Shaw and Bruce Cam
eron again led Stanford sticks with
two hits each, this time l>eing joined
by Dick Clegg with another pair.
Clegg also had n great day in the
field, going high in the air on three
different plays to spear wild pegs
and turn errors into putouts.
"Wasn't that a sweet infield out
there today," remarked Dutch Feh
ring just after Jack Heinen had
struck out Duane Kling to end the
game. And then thinking about USC
squeezing into the playoffs on a fluke,
he added, "It's a shame such a rule
could exist in the first place. I wish
they had told us this before the USC
series two weeks ago."
No Statement Yet
The CIBA, presided over by Cali
fornia's Clint Evans this season, has
taken the same stand as Stanford's
Athletic Department — that is, no
statement until further develop
ments.
It was hoped that Sam Barry, the
USC headman, would not accept the
bid in favor of the CIBA winner,
which would certainly have strength
ened the league which he himself

helped to form, and gained back some \
of the friends USC lost at the Fresno
Relays.
Meanwhile, the Stanford ballplay
ers could do nothing but wait for I
those further developments. Co- j
captain Charlie Cole summed up their '
position when he stated, "I think the
CIBA has proved itself to he the best |
college baseball league in the conn- \
try, I think we won it, and I think
we deserve something for it."
As it stands, the Indians will meet '
USF on the Sunken Diamond tomor
row and then will finish the season
next Saturday against the Alumni on
the same field, while USC takes on
Washington State in the north:

BULLETIN
In a special telephone interview to The Daily, DSC Coach Sain Ban.v
said last night that it was "a possibility" that USC would forego the PC*
playoff game with Northern Division Champions, Washington State, in fa
vor of Stanford. Barry added that, in liis opinion (as a member of th«-
NCAA Board), Stanford should have a right to play the Northern Di
vision Champion to determine who would represent District 8 (Pacific
Coast) in the national playoffs in .Inne, regardless of who played WSC
for the PCC title.
Barry, however, said that lie had not as yet conferred with the top
USC Athletic Department bosses, and that no official action had yet been
taken.
By JOHN HALL
The California Intercollegiate Baseball Asociation was trembling
on its inadequate foundations today as a result of the Conference
ruling which has snubbed Stanford's league champs, and named
USC as the southern representative for the PCC playoffs next
weekend.
Stanford won undisputed rights to its first CIBA title in 19 yeai:;

" " I J
last Saturday at Moraga by knocking*
off St. Mary's, 4 to 2, while USC was
dropping its second game of the
weekend, this time to California, (i
to 5, at Berkeley.
The Cards finished with a 10 and ■> i
season record, a game and one -half |
ahead of second-place California, j
and two full games 111 front of the I
chosen Trojans.
But Troy, dropped into a third j
place tie with Santa Clara in the six- |
team CIBA, will play Washington
State in the playoffs because of Vic
tor Schmidt's statement that all
games with St. Mary's and Santa
Clara will not be counted toward I
PCC records.
Decided Last Year
The Conference officials decided
before last season that only games
against PCC opponents would be
counted in the win and loss records,
thus hoisting the Trojans into a tie
with Stanford at (i wins and .'} losses
each.
Because USC took 2 out of from
Stanford, the Trojans have been se
lected, the result of another new rul
ing which was designed early last
year to do away with CIBA playoffs.
Made known in the typical Victor
O. Schmidt manner, this weird twist
to the finish of the CIBA race was j
accepted with bitterness by the In- j
dian baseballers who did not hear of
it until after USC had already blown
its league chances by dropping a 1 to
2 decision to the Gaels on Friday.
Hurts CIBA
"This may be the end of Hie CIBA,"
voiced St. Mary's Coach Johnny Ver- I
gez, who thought the Indians were!
the logical team to pick. "We rould '
probably do better by forming a
league out of B>iy Area teams, in
cluding College of Pacifir, I'SF, and
San Jose State," Vergez added.
More dissatisfaction was expressed
by Art Reichele, UCLA headman,
who wired Everett Dean yesterday to
say that he believed Stanford is the
best team in the league and should be
its representative.
However, the Stanford Athletic
Department, refusing to take an im
mediate stand on the matter, stated
that it would "wait for further de
velopments" before taking a concrete
course of action.
As disappointed as his players as
he walked back If) the Moraga locker

! rooms after winning the CIBA crown
j ui his first year as bead coacn. I'.v
J erett Dean remarked, "Wei!, we've
won the pennant, now what can w
do with it?"
There didn't, appeal to be an im
mediate answer. Stanford bad
hanked everything on beating S*
Mary's aaid earning the right to com
pete in the national championship
Veteran Dave Stott, a surprise
starter on Saturday, responded
a masterful four-hit shutout I t
seven innings before he tired an'l
had to get help from fireball Jack
j Heinen.
Heinen came to the rescue with
the sacks loaded in the eighth wilh
only one down, and after giving up •<
two-run double, he settlea tlown to
strike out the side.
Early Lead
Stanford worked Ken Figeroid for
nine hits, mostly in the opening

BULLETIN
In a special telephone interview to The Daily, DSC Coach Sain Ban.v
said last night that it was "a possibility" that USC would forego the PC*
playoff game with Northern Division Champions, Washington State, in fa
vor of Stanford. Barry added that, in liis opinion (as a member of th«-
NCAA Board), Stanford should have a right to play the Northern Di
vision Champion to determine who would represent District 8 (Pacific
Coast) in the national playoffs in .Inne, regardless of who played WSC
for the PCC title.
Barry, however, said that lie had not as yet conferred with the top
USC Athletic Department bosses, and that no official action had yet been
taken.
By JOHN HALL
The California Intercollegiate Baseball Asociation was trembling
on its inadequate foundations today as a result of the Conference
ruling which has snubbed Stanford's league champs, and named
USC as the southern representative for the PCC playoffs next
weekend.
Stanford won undisputed rights to its first CIBA title in 19 yeai:;

" " I J
last Saturday at Moraga by knocking*
off St. Mary's, 4 to 2, while USC was
dropping its second game of the
weekend, this time to California, (i
to 5, at Berkeley.
The Cards finished with a 10 and ■> i
season record, a game and one -half |
ahead of second-place California, j
and two full games 111 front of the I
chosen Trojans.
But Troy, dropped into a third j
place tie with Santa Clara in the six- |
team CIBA, will play Washington
State in the playoffs because of Vic
tor Schmidt's statement that all
games with St. Mary's and Santa
Clara will not be counted toward I
PCC records.
Decided Last Year
The Conference officials decided
before last season that only games
against PCC opponents would be
counted in the win and loss records,
thus hoisting the Trojans into a tie
with Stanford at (i wins and .'} losses
each.
Because USC took 2 out of from
Stanford, the Trojans have been se
lected, the result of another new rul
ing which was designed early last
year to do away with CIBA playoffs.
Made known in the typical Victor
O. Schmidt manner, this weird twist
to the finish of the CIBA race was j
accepted with bitterness by the In- j
dian baseballers who did not hear of
it until after USC had already blown
its league chances by dropping a 1 to
2 decision to the Gaels on Friday.
Hurts CIBA
"This may be the end of Hie CIBA,"
voiced St. Mary's Coach Johnny Ver- I
gez, who thought the Indians were!
the logical team to pick. "We rould '
probably do better by forming a
league out of B>iy Area teams, in
cluding College of Pacifir, I'SF, and
San Jose State," Vergez added.
More dissatisfaction was expressed
by Art Reichele, UCLA headman,
who wired Everett Dean yesterday to
say that he believed Stanford is the
best team in the league and should be
its representative.
However, the Stanford Athletic
Department, refusing to take an im
mediate stand on the matter, stated
that it would "wait for further de
velopments" before taking a concrete
course of action.
As disappointed as his players as
he walked back If) the Moraga locker

! rooms after winning the CIBA crown
j ui his first year as bead coacn. I'.v
J erett Dean remarked, "Wei!, we've
won the pennant, now what can w
do with it?"
There didn't, appeal to be an im
mediate answer. Stanford bad
hanked everything on beating S*
Mary's aaid earning the right to com
pete in the national championship
Veteran Dave Stott, a surprise
starter on Saturday, responded
a masterful four-hit shutout I t
seven innings before he tired an'l
had to get help from fireball Jack
j Heinen.
Heinen came to the rescue with
the sacks loaded in the eighth wilh
only one down, and after giving up •<
two-run double, he settlea tlown to
strike out the side.
Early Lead
Stanford worked Ken Figeroid for
nine hits, mostly in the opening
frames, to give Stott a nice cushion
of four early runs. Dick Clegg's sin
gle, Tom Shaw's darting triple to
right, and a passed ball produced two
Card runs in the second.
A Dave Melton double and a Cleg>
triple netted another in the third,
and a walk to Bill Herron, a sacri
fice by Stott, and Chuck Cole's safety
to center brought iu Stanford's final
tally in the fourth.
Continuing to paste their Gael
cousins, Tom Shaw and Bruce Cam
eron again led Stanford sticks with
two hits each, this time l>eing joined
by Dick Clegg with another pair.
Clegg also had n great day in the
field, going high in the air on three
different plays to spear wild pegs
and turn errors into putouts.
"Wasn't that a sweet infield out
there today," remarked Dutch Feh
ring just after Jack Heinen had
struck out Duane Kling to end the
game. And then thinking about USC
squeezing into the playoffs on a fluke,
he added, "It's a shame such a rule
could exist in the first place. I wish
they had told us this before the USC
series two weeks ago."
No Statement Yet
The CIBA, presided over by Cali
fornia's Clint Evans this season, has
taken the same stand as Stanford's
Athletic Department — that is, no
statement until further develop
ments.
It was hoped that Sam Barry, the
USC headman, would not accept the
bid in favor of the CIBA winner,
which would certainly have strength
ened the league which he himself

helped to form, and gained back some \
of the friends USC lost at the Fresno
Relays.
Meanwhile, the Stanford ballplay
ers could do nothing but wait for I
those further developments. Co- j
captain Charlie Cole summed up their '
position when he stated, "I think the
CIBA has proved itself to he the best |
college baseball league in the conn- \
try, I think we won it, and I think
we deserve something for it."
As it stands, the Indians will meet '
USF on the Sunken Diamond tomor
row and then will finish the season
next Saturday against the Alumni on
the same field, while USC takes on
Washington State in the north:

Department, refusing to take an im
mediate stand on the matter, stated
that it would "wait for further de
velopments" before taking a concrete
course of action.

Veteran Dave Stott, a surprise
starter on Saturday, responded
a masterful four-hit shutout I t
seven innings before he tired an'l
had to get help from fireball Jack
j Heinen.
Heinen came to the rescue with
the sacks loaded in the eighth wilh
only one down, and after giving up •<
two-run double, he settlea tlown to
strike out the side.
Early Lead
Stanford worked Ken Figeroid for
nine hits, mostly in the opening
frames, to give Stott a nice cushion
of four early runs. Dick Clegg's sin
gle, Tom Shaw's darting triple to
right, and a passed ball produced two
Card runs in the second.
A Dave Melton double and a Cleg>
triple netted another in the third,
and a walk to Bill Herron, a sacri
fice by Stott, and Chuck Cole's safety
to center brought iu Stanford's final
tally in the fourth.
Continuing to paste their Gael
cousins, Tom Shaw and Bruce Cam
eron again led Stanford sticks with
two hits each, this time l>eing joined
by Dick Clegg with another pair.
Clegg also had n great day in the
field, going high in the air on three
different plays to spear wild pegs
and turn errors into putouts.
"Wasn't that a sweet infield out
there today," remarked Dutch Feh
ring just after Jack Heinen had
struck out Duane Kling to end the
game. And then thinking about USC
squeezing into the playoffs on a fluke,
he added, "It's a shame such a rule
could exist in the first place. I wish
they had told us this before the USC
series two weeks ago."
No Statement Yet
The CIBA, presided over by Cali
fornia's Clint Evans this season, has
taken the same stand as Stanford's
Athletic Department — that is, no
statement until further develop
ments.
It was hoped that Sam Barry, the
USC headman, would not accept the
bid in favor of the CIBA winner,
which would certainly have strength
ened the league which he himself

helped to form, and gained back some \
of the friends USC lost at the Fresno
Relays.
Meanwhile, the Stanford ballplay
ers could do nothing but wait for I
those further developments. Co- j
captain Charlie Cole summed up their '
position when he stated, "I think the
CIBA has proved itself to he the best |
college baseball league in the conn- \
try, I think we won it, and I think
we deserve something for it."
As it stands, the Indians will meet '
USF on the Sunken Diamond tomor
row and then will finish the season
next Saturday against the Alumni on
the same field, while USC takes on
Washington State in the north:

BULLETIN
In a special telephone interview to The Daily, DSC Coach Sain Ban.v
said last night that it was "a possibility" that USC would forego the PC*
playoff game with Northern Division Champions, Washington State, in fa
vor of Stanford. Barry added that, in liis opinion (as a member of th«-
NCAA Board), Stanford should have a right to play the Northern Di
vision Champion to determine who would represent District 8 (Pacific
Coast) in the national playoffs in .Inne, regardless of who played WSC
for the PCC title.
Barry, however, said that lie had not as yet conferred with the top
USC Athletic Department bosses, and that no official action had yet been
taken.

The California Intercollegiate Baseball Asociation was trembling
on its inadequate foundations today as a result of the Conference
ruling which has snubbed Stanford's league champs, and named
USC as the southern representative for the PCC playoffs next
weekend.

place tie with Santa Clara in the six- |
