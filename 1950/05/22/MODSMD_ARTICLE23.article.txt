# One Pennant, Slightly Soured

There are all kinds of rules. Good and bad.
Fair and unfair. Sensible and ridiculous. Some
should never be broken. Others should never
be rules.
Twice within the past week Stanford's athletes
have come out on the slioit end of thoroughly
bad rulings. First, at the Fresno Relays, the
Card track team lost to USC because of a prece
dent bieaking ruling which gave' the Trojan
tracksters second-place points in an event
where they should have received no points at
all, according to every rule book in existence.
Kow Everett Dean's Farm baseball club, win
ners ot the CIBA by a solid two games, with a
CIBA season's record of 10 wins and 5 losses,
has been refused a chance at the Pacific Coast
Conference title because of an obscure and mis
directed PCC ruling.
The ruling set up by the PCC at their January
1949 meeting, provides that legardless of the
CIBA final standings, the PCC team with the
best record in play with other PCC teams will
lepresent the Southern Division m the playoffs
for the Coast title.
Obviously, the intent of the ruling was to
keep non-Conference teams (Santa Clara and
In. Mary's), which were brought into the CIBA
to "make a better league," from getting a foot
j ri the Conference door.
both Stanford and USC ended CIBA play with
a record of 6 wins and 3 losses against PCC
foes. But since (JSC beat the Cards in tv/o
games out of three, the SC squad has been

chosen to tackle Washington State for the Coasi
championship. That's the SC squad that fin
ished with a tie for third in the CIBA.
The controversial ruling, although in effect
before last season, went unquestioned in '49
because USC's title was clear-cut.
Coach Everett Dean was informed by Mr.
Masters of the ruling only last week. Too late.
Too late to have slanted the Cards' best hurlers
against the Conference teams, rather than
against the Gaels and Broncos. As it was, Joe
Chez, top pitcher in the CIBA, went against the
Trojans only once. We won.
That the ruling was obscure is evidenced by
the fact that, after the last USC-Stanford game,
Dean and the Trojan coach, Sam Barry, were
going over plans for a play-off game if the CIBA
should end in a tie between the two schools.
The PCC ruling, to accomplish the end
which, we understand, was intended, should
provide that the Conference team with the best
CIBA record represent the Southern Division in
the title playoffs.
This would provide insurance that the best
Conference team would represent the Southern
Division. Although the Gaels and Broncos are
not in the PCC, their CIBA teams are strong
more often than not. The showing of Confer
ence teams against these "semi-outsiders"
should be taken into account.
What action will be taken, nobody knows.
As it stands, a fine Stanford baseball team owns
a hard-earned pennant, slightly soured, and a
very legitimate gripe.

against the Gaels and Broncos. As it was, Joe
Chez, top pitcher in the CIBA, went against the
Trojans only once. We won.
That the ruling was obscure is evidenced by
the fact that, after the last USC-Stanford game,
Dean and the Trojan coach, Sam Barry, were
going over plans for a play-off game if the CIBA
should end in a tie between the two schools.
The PCC ruling, to accomplish the end
which, we understand, was intended, should
provide that the Conference team with the best
CIBA record represent the Southern Division in
the title playoffs.
This would provide insurance that the best
Conference team would represent the Southern
Division. Although the Gaels and Broncos are
not in the PCC, their CIBA teams are strong
more often than not. The showing of Confer
ence teams against these "semi-outsiders"
should be taken into account.
What action will be taken, nobody knows.
As it stands, a fine Stanford baseball team owns
a hard-earned pennant, slightly soured, and a
very legitimate gripe.
There are all kinds of rules. Good and bad.
Fair and unfair. Sensible and ridiculous. Some
should never be broken. Others should never
be rules.
Twice within the past week Stanford's athletes
have come out on the slioit end of thoroughly
bad rulings. First, at the Fresno Relays, the
Card track team lost to USC because of a prece
dent bieaking ruling which gave' the Trojan
tracksters second-place points in an event
where they should have received no points at
all, according to every rule book in existence.
Kow Everett Dean's Farm baseball club, win
ners ot the CIBA by a solid two games, with a
CIBA season's record of 10 wins and 5 losses,
has been refused a chance at the Pacific Coast
Conference title because of an obscure and mis
directed PCC ruling.
The ruling set up by the PCC at their January
1949 meeting, provides that legardless of the
CIBA final standings, the PCC team with the
best record in play with other PCC teams will
lepresent the Southern Division m the playoffs
for the Coast title.
Obviously, the intent of the ruling was to
keep non-Conference teams (Santa Clara and
In. Mary's), which were brought into the CIBA
to "make a better league," from getting a foot
j ri the Conference door.
both Stanford and USC ended CIBA play with
a record of 6 wins and 3 losses against PCC
foes. But since (JSC beat the Cards in tv/o
games out of three, the SC squad has been

chosen to tackle Washington State for the Coasi
championship. That's the SC squad that fin
ished with a tie for third in the CIBA.
The controversial ruling, although in effect
before last season, went unquestioned in '49
because USC's title was clear-cut.
Coach Everett Dean was informed by Mr.
Masters of the ruling only last week. Too late.
Too late to have slanted the Cards' best hurlers
against the Conference teams, rather than
against the Gaels and Broncos. As it was, Joe
Chez, top pitcher in the CIBA, went against the
Trojans only once. We won.
