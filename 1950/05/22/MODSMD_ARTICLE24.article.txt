## Weekend at the Library 
### 
Although examinations are approaching at an
alarming speed, I managed to spend a few hours dur
ing the weekend wandering around the stacks in the
Library. Dr. Bark had warned me against trying to
•et up light housekeeping in the Library when he
recommended me for a stack permit, hut oftentimes I
find the temptation almost too great. Just the musty
• 'ne 11 of old imprisoned books is temptation enough,
not to mention the great variety of leading material
available.
It was an exceedingly delightful few hours that I
pent. 1 flipped through the yellow pages of Shake
• pot.it and recalled long forgotten lines. 1 blew the
dust from Plutarch's Morals and found that none ox
the five volumes had been taken out for more than 10
years. 1 picked out a book here and another book
there, and browsed quickly through each to decide if
it was worth reading.
'1 he trouble was I discovered so many books that
were worth reading. It was extremely difficult trying
to decide which ones to take with me and which ones
to leave behind. When it came to deciding between
Apueius and Porphyrius, or between Voltaire and
Rabelais, or between the Obiter Dicta essays of Augus
tine Birrell and the exquisite poems of my native Li
Po ; 1 was lost.

I would certainly like to read all of them, for it has
been said that reading maketh a full man. But being
in a university and being saddled with all sorts of re
quirements, my time is not my own. When I read, I
like to read slowly and carefully, or else not at all.
Some people gallop at top speed through a book, and
having finished it, still remain ignorant of its real con
tent. Others make a fatuous pretense at reading just
to be in the swim. 1 feel that when a book is being
read, the author should at least be paid the tribute of
having his work carefully studied. Whether one agrees
with him or not is another matter.
Finally, 1 had to decide by closing rny eyes and pick
ing out a few books from the heap at random. Later,
when 1 complained to a scholarly friend of mine about
my lack of time to pursue readings of my own choos
ing, he said: "You are living under the illusion that
one enters a university for the purposes of an edu
cation. One merely enters a university for a degree.
The education begins later. You should not try to
do both at the same time."
Upon reflection, I began to think that perhaps his
words contained more wisdom than wit. Perhaps I
should concentrate on getting my degree first and
leave my education to some future date.
