## Teaching at Howard University 
### 
To the Editor:
fn answer to the letter which appeared in The Daily
of May 19 and for the general information of all inter
ested persons, I am submitting the following letter
which was sent to the Stanford Chapter of the Na
tional Association for the Advancement of Colored
People:
Miss Lois Deimel, Secretary
Stanford Chapter, NAACP
Dear Miss Deimel:
'Ihank you for your thoughtful Utter of May 17 re
garding teaching at Howard University.
You will be interested to know that I based my
previous claim that Howard University teaches its
: tudents that white people descended from Negroes
on an article which appeared on June 20, 1944, in the
Congressional Record. The article quotes Dr. William
Leo Hansberry, professor of history at Howard, as
vaying that Negroes crossing the Sahara Desert many
hundreds of years ago were so bleached by the
.scorching sun that they evolved into white people.

Since Dr. Hansberry is still a teacher at Howard from
all data which I have been able to gather, I presume
that he still exercises some influence over the teachings
at that university.
Naturally I was amazed, as you must be, at this
completely asinine pronouncement by Dr. Hansberry,
but 1 submit that the claims which I have made are
substantiated by the record.
it is indeed unfortunate that the United States
government and the taxpayers of America are sup
porting a school such as Howard University which
allows its teachers to propagate the type of utter non
sense which Dr. Hansberry seems to propagating. 1
am unable to understand why the taxpayers of Amer
ica have to support only one (federal) university in
America—and that university one which is maintained
exclusively for the Negro race.
Again let me thank you for your kindness in writing
to me, and with all good wishes, believe me to be,
Very sincerely yours,
DONALD E. CLOSE
