### JULIE DOCKSTADER 
The Sigma Nu's liad sandwiches,
milk, and apples for lunch last Fri
day—nothing out ol the ordinary,
except for the fact that the meal
was eaten on the Roble lawn.
At 3:30 that morning, the Sigma
Nu pledges had stolen silently into
their fraternity house on a mission
designed to confuse and frustrate
the actives. It took them an hour
and a half to move the heavy dinner
tables to Roble, to make off with
the three-foot-high dinner-bell, ;md
to block the driveway of the Sigma
Nu house with the actives' cars.

For a final, touch, they sprayed
the sleeping porch with water from
a garden hose and pulled out every
light - fuse they could find. Then
they left hastily, ringing (lie din
ner-bell in farewell.
Eagle-eyed actives, sent out as
scouts, found the table later in the
morning. They decided to take ad
vantage of the sunny weather and
the interesting view, so, loading ev
ery available car with chairs and
lunch, they moved en masse to
Koble for a meal of pickles, sand
wiches, milk, cookies, and apples.
Although persuasive Robleites
were given most of the pickles, the
Sigma Nu's finished the rest in a
hurry, and played a game of vol
leyball on the Roble volleyball
court after lunch.
The tables finally were taken
back to the Sigma Nu house late
in the afternoon. The actives had
to do the work, but they weren't
complaining. The majority opinion
was that the pledges couldn't have
picked a nicer place for the tables—
and, besides, the lunch was great.
