and Cole in the dual meet, which

shattered when Mrs. Wolf's boy
went out too slow, showing the ef
fects of his 100-yard backstroke
duel with Weeden an hour earlier,
and fell so far behind that he was
able to catch but one of the Indians
in the race.
Sala and Cole went out together
for ten laps, at which point they
were half :i lap ahead of Polte. Sala

able to catch but one of the Indians
in the race.
