## Indian Wins PCC Crown 
### 
Sophomore Dick McElyea, play
ing outstanding golf when the chips
were down, won the PCC Southern
Division individual golf champion
ship Saturday afternoon when he
defeated Ted Engs of California, 2
and 1, on the local course.
With his victory McElyea became
the first Stanford man to win the
individual crown since Tom Lambie
turned the trick in 1946. It also
added greater prestige to the In
dians' team title which they won
last Thursday.
In Saturday's final match McEl
yea took a two-up lead after the
first nine holes only to see Engs
fight back and square the match on
the 12th hole. McElyea, however,
regained the lead on the 15th hole,
and ended the match on the 17th
when Engs could not match his par
three.
Sweet Revenue
It was sweet revenge for McElyea,
who lost two out of three points to
Engs when they opposed each other
in the Cal-Stanford match a month
ago.
McElyea won the crown because
of his excellent chipping and putt
ing. Although he bits a straight
drive, the Card sophomore does not
p,et the distance that most collegiate
golfers do. He makes up for this
fault, however, with an outstanding
short game.
McElyea reached the final round
by disposing of USC's Grant Meyer,
0 and 5; Leonard Kennett, also of
USC, 1-up; and teammate Bud Moe
in the Saturday morning semi-final
match, 2-up.
Two other Stanford men survived
the opening round. Moe defeated
Dick Banks of UCLA, 3 and 2. and
Jack Knosher edged USC's Dick
Davies, 1-up. The Indians' two oth
er qualifiers, Bob Crozier and Dave
Mitten, lost opening round matches.
Crozier lost to Bob Pastore of USC
on the 19th hole, and Mitten lost to
Kennett, 2 and 1.

Moe's exhibition of golf on Fri
day was the best of the tourney.
After beating Banks he blasted
Knosher, 6 and 5. Moe was three
strokes under par for the 30 holes
he played.
Coach Bud Finger expects to get
official permission from the Athletic
Department tomorrow to take the
Indian squad to Albuquerque for
the NCAA championship starting
June 26. UCLA has already indi
cated its intention to participate in
the tournament.
The Indians will complete their
regular season next Saturday, when
1 hey meet San Jose State in a return
match. The Indians defeated the
Spartans, 17 to 10, three weeks ago.

the NCAA championship starting
June 26. UCLA has already indi
cated its intention to participate in
the tournament.
The Indians will complete their
regular season next Saturday, when
1 hey meet San Jose State in a return
match. The Indians defeated the
Spartans, 17 to 10, three weeks ago.
Sophomore Dick McElyea, play
ing outstanding golf when the chips
were down, won the PCC Southern
Division individual golf champion
ship Saturday afternoon when he
defeated Ted Engs of California, 2
and 1, on the local course.
With his victory McElyea became
the first Stanford man to win the
individual crown since Tom Lambie
turned the trick in 1946. It also
added greater prestige to the In
dians' team title which they won
last Thursday.
In Saturday's final match McEl
yea took a two-up lead after the
first nine holes only to see Engs
fight back and square the match on
the 12th hole. McElyea, however,
regained the lead on the 15th hole,
and ended the match on the 17th
when Engs could not match his par
three.
Sweet Revenue
It was sweet revenge for McElyea,
who lost two out of three points to
Engs when they opposed each other
in the Cal-Stanford match a month
ago.
McElyea won the crown because
of his excellent chipping and putt
ing. Although he bits a straight
drive, the Card sophomore does not
p,et the distance that most collegiate
golfers do. He makes up for this
fault, however, with an outstanding
short game.
McElyea reached the final round
by disposing of USC's Grant Meyer,
0 and 5; Leonard Kennett, also of
USC, 1-up; and teammate Bud Moe
in the Saturday morning semi-final
match, 2-up.
Two other Stanford men survived
the opening round. Moe defeated
Dick Banks of UCLA, 3 and 2. and
Jack Knosher edged USC's Dick
Davies, 1-up. The Indians' two oth
er qualifiers, Bob Crozier and Dave
Mitten, lost opening round matches.
Crozier lost to Bob Pastore of USC
on the 19th hole, and Mitten lost to
Kennett, 2 and 1.
Pel-mission for NCAA Trip
Moe's exhibition of golf on Fri
day was the best of the tourney.
After beating Banks he blasted
Knosher, 6 and 5. Moe was three
strokes under par for the 30 holes
he played.
Coach Bud Finger expects to get
official permission from the Athletic
Department tomorrow to take the
Indian squad to Albuquerque for
the NCAA championship starting
June 26. UCLA has already indi
cated its intention to participate in
