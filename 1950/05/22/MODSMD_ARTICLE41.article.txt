# Cardinals End Trojan Track Reign; Score Upset Victory at Modesto Relays
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
With a stunning upset victory in the Modesto Ralays behind them, Stanford's rejuvenated track
forces are anxiously awaiting another crack at their arch cinder rivals, Southern California, in the
PCC Meet to be held at Berkeley Saturday.
The five-point win over the Trojans came as complete surprise to the 8,000 California Relays fans,
and it marked the Indians' first track victory over USC since before the war.

Clean Sweep
The Stanford freshmen made it a
clean sweep, as they romped to an
easy 10-point win over second-place
Modesto and San Mateo in the Frosh-
Junior College Division. Bob Mathias
smashed two meet records, in the
high hurdles nad the discus.
Two big breaks helped the Card
varsity grab its first California He
lays win. First of all, the Trojan 440
relay team was disqualified for pass
ing out of bounds.
Later, near the end of the meet,
John Bradley of USC pulled a mus
cle in the anchor lap of the 880 sprint
relay, and was forced to drop out of
the race. At the time of Bradley's
mishap, the Trojan sprinter was run
ning neck and neck with Stanford's
Gay Bryan, and therefore it cost
Southern Cal at least 8 and pos
sibly 10 points.
Cards Win Both Sprint Relays
Stanford took full advantage of the
two breaks. The Indians won both
the 440 and 880 relays, and in the last
race of the day, edged USC for third
place in the mile relay.
Other come-through performances
at Modesto included Jack Burke's
153 ft. discus throw lor fourth place,
Otis Chandler's 55 ft. IV2 in. shot
put toss for first place, and the Stan
lord two-mile relay team's third
place effort, which beat a favored
California team by five yards.
Friday night in the Coliseum Re
lays, a strong eight-man Stanford
team also fared well. The Indians'
undefeated 440 yard relay quartet,
composed of Ronnie Buck, Bob
Bryan, Wilbur Taylor, and Gay
Bryan, beat the best teams in the
nation to win in :40.9. just four
tenths of a second off the world rec
ord.
In the thrilling race, the University
of Texas team, with Charley Parker
anchoring, placed second, USC came
in third, and Rice was fourth.
Chandler Breaks Record
In addition, Otis Chandler turned
in his best mark of the year, 55 ft.
8% in., to set a new Coliseum Relay
record, and Bud Held, bouncing back
from a defeat at Fresno last weekend,
won the javelin at 214 ft. lIV 2 in.
Held won his event at Modesto with
a 217 ft. 7 in. throw.
For the second consecutive week,
a new world's record was established
in a West Coast relay meet. Edging
a USC team by two yards, Michigan
State's 2-mile relay foursome shat
tered California's 7:34.5 standard by
2.7 seconds on the Coliseum track.
With Bob Pruitt anchoring, the
Trojan two-mile team also unoffi
cially broke the old world record,
but had to be satisfied with second
place.
Frosh Win Again
For the scecond consecutive year,
Coach Ray Dean's frosh cindermen
won the Frosh-Junior College divi
sion at Modesto. The Indian year
lings, led by all-purpose star Bob
Mathias, rolled up an impressive 40-
point total.
Modesto and San Mateo Junior

Colleges tied for second with 30
points, the UCLA frosh placed third
with 17, and the USC frosh were
fourth with IC.
Mathias broke two meet records
with a 14.5 effort in the high hurdles
and a 151 ft. 3 in. throw in the discus.
The frosh ace also tossed the shot 49
ft. 6 in. for second place, leaped G ft.
1% in. in the high jump for third,
and ran laps in the 440 and 880 re
lays.
Duke Johnson of the Stanford
frosh turned in a tremendous 13 ft.
leap in the pole vault to tie for first.
The Card medley relay team of Gene
Coler, Fred Rodkey, George Griffin,
and Bob Simon, took first place in

PCC Meet to be held at Berkeley Saturday.
The five-point win over the Trojans came as complete surprise to the 8,000 California Relays fans,
and it marked the Indians' first track victory over USC since before the war.

Clean Sweep
The Stanford freshmen made it a
clean sweep, as they romped to an
easy 10-point win over second-place
Modesto and San Mateo in the Frosh-
Junior College Division. Bob Mathias
smashed two meet records, in the
high hurdles nad the discus.
Two big breaks helped the Card
varsity grab its first California He
lays win. First of all, the Trojan 440
relay team was disqualified for pass
ing out of bounds.
Later, near the end of the meet,
John Bradley of USC pulled a mus
cle in the anchor lap of the 880 sprint
relay, and was forced to drop out of
the race. At the time of Bradley's
mishap, the Trojan sprinter was run
ning neck and neck with Stanford's
Gay Bryan, and therefore it cost
Southern Cal at least 8 and pos
sibly 10 points.
Cards Win Both Sprint Relays
Stanford took full advantage of the
two breaks. The Indians won both
the 440 and 880 relays, and in the last
race of the day, edged USC for third
place in the mile relay.
Other come-through performances
at Modesto included Jack Burke's
153 ft. discus throw lor fourth place,
Otis Chandler's 55 ft. IV2 in. shot
put toss for first place, and the Stan
lord two-mile relay team's third
place effort, which beat a favored
California team by five yards.
Friday night in the Coliseum Re
lays, a strong eight-man Stanford
team also fared well. The Indians'
undefeated 440 yard relay quartet,
composed of Ronnie Buck, Bob
Bryan, Wilbur Taylor, and Gay
Bryan, beat the best teams in the
nation to win in :40.9. just four
tenths of a second off the world rec
ord.
In the thrilling race, the University
of Texas team, with Charley Parker
anchoring, placed second, USC came
in third, and Rice was fourth.
Chandler Breaks Record
In addition, Otis Chandler turned
in his best mark of the year, 55 ft.
8% in., to set a new Coliseum Relay
record, and Bud Held, bouncing back
from a defeat at Fresno last weekend,
won the javelin at 214 ft. lIV 2 in.
Held won his event at Modesto with
a 217 ft. 7 in. throw.
For the second consecutive week,
a new world's record was established
in a West Coast relay meet. Edging
a USC team by two yards, Michigan
State's 2-mile relay foursome shat
tered California's 7:34.5 standard by
2.7 seconds on the Coliseum track.
With Bob Pruitt anchoring, the
Trojan two-mile team also unoffi
cially broke the old world record,
but had to be satisfied with second
place.
Frosh Win Again
For the scecond consecutive year,
Coach Ray Dean's frosh cindermen
won the Frosh-Junior College divi
sion at Modesto. The Indian year
lings, led by all-purpose star Bob
Mathias, rolled up an impressive 40-
point total.
Modesto and San Mateo Junior

Colleges tied for second with 30
points, the UCLA frosh placed third
with 17, and the USC frosh were
