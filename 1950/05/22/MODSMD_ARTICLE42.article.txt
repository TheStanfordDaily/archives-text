# Red Netters Lose to Cal
## 
### 
The roof caved in on the Stanford
netters Saturday. While all the rest
of the Card teams were winning
championships, the tennis squad
dropped into the PCC cellar with a
7 to 2 loss to California on the
Berkeley courts.
Playing some of their worst tennis
of the season, the varsity managed
to win only third and fifth singles
from the surprising Bears. George
Gentry outslugged Don Menke, 9-7,
2-G, 6-3. In another three-set match,
Vince Schmieder outlasted Merrill
Albert, Cal captain, 6-4, 2-6. 8-6.

All intramural volleyball make
up games will be played by Fri
day. The intramural department
will inform the teams to play by
telephone.

The Indians blew the rest. In the
feature match. Bear Loren Main de
feated Kirke Mechem, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5.
Kirke looked especially strong dur
ing the . second set, but just could
not equal the sharp-shooting Cana
dian ace.
This loss was a complete reversal
of the first engagement which the
Indians won by a 7 to 2 count.
Added to the double losses to both
USC and UCLA, it gave Stanford a
one-and-five record in loop court
action. This put them in a dead heat
for the cellar with the Bears.
Everything was not dark over the
weekend. The Indians racked up an
easy 8 to 1 win over the San Jose
State Spartans. In the Friday
matches played on the home courts,
Mechem whipped the CCAA singles
champ, Butch Kirkorian, 6-1 and
6-3.
Mechem combined with George
Gentry to snag the top doubles by
a 6-4, 6-4 tally. Only loss to the
Spartan team was the third doubles
tandem of Schmieder-Dean Brink
man.
Completing the weekend tennis
program was a 7 1 /fe to IV2 defeat at
the hands of the California fresh
men. Even the smooth-playing Bob
Sibert and Charlie Hickox fell be
fore Fred Hagist and Rupe Ricke
son. Only point made was in the
third doubles, and the other half
point was through an uncompleted
doubles match.
