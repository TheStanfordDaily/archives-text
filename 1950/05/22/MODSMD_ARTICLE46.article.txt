# Building 117 Is Renamed Terman Hall
## 
### 
Building 117 was renamed "Ter
man Hal!" in dedication ceremonies
conducted at the Village Thursday
afternoon.
Dean Frederick E. Terinan of the
School of Engineering officially
opened the hall in a ribbon-cutting
certynony, after Mrs. Terman had
unveiled the name plate for the en
gineering students' dormitory.
Dean Terman spoke briefly on
problems that may face engineers
after graduation.
Speaking on the job situation, he
said that present statistics show
there are more graduating engi
neers than jobs available, but he
believed that probably all would
find jobs.
But, Terman said, in the next
three years there would be a defi
nite shortage of engineers. This
means that the present sophomores
can be sure of obtaining jobs, he de
clared.
"The fellows that get ahead are
the fellows who have an objective,"
he added. "To move ahead toward a
goal, you have to integrate your life
toward that goal."
Dean Terman advised students
not to worry about there not being
anything mere to do in the field of
engineering, since more research in
technical knowledge is going on
now than ever before.
Other guest speakers were Vil
lage Director Dwight B. Adams and
Harold K. Parker, head of the Vil
lage Student Personnel Services.
The guests were welcomed by
house president Philip Goodrich
and Resident Assistant Howard
Johnson. The speakers were intro
duced by master of ceremonies Jack
Tombly.
