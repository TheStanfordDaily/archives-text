# Dust Clouds Caused by Road Repairs Are Only Temporary
## 
### 
Hay fever sufTerers will continue
to cuss Stanford's roads for a few
more days. By that time, most of
the dust created by the Corpora
tion Yard's recent "protective main
tenance" work should have dissi
pated.
The temporary dust bowl can't be
helped, said Carroll Blacker, su
perintendent of buildings and
grounds. The yearly maintenance
job calls for "dirty gravel" and oil.
Clean gravel, which is more expen
sive, won't do, as it won't sift down
and fill the cracks in the pavement,

Likewise, sand does not do a coin
i plete job.
"Wo can't wet down the road
with water," said Blacker, "as th.i
i would wash the dirt away and dc
i feat our purpose."
