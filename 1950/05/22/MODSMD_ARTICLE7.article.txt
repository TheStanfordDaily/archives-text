WASHINGTON The Senate
threatened today to throw out some
more of President Truman's reor
ganization plans before Tuesday
night when those which escape he
come law automatically.
Except for one, the rejected plans
were built on specific government
reform proposals of the 12-mcmbcr,
bipartisan commission headed by
former President Herbert Hoover.
