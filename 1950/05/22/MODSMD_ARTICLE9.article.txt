## 
### 
Stanford's annual Alnrnni Conference held Saturday broke all
previous attendance records. More than 950 persons were regis
tered for the Alumni Assembly, business meeting of the confer
ence, which took place Saturday morning.
Memorial Auditorium was filled to near capacity for the "Stan-

ford Family Hour" panel held Satur-'
day afternoon. University problems
were discussed by Wallace Sterling,
President of Stanford; Hank Rosin,
ASSU president; Lawrence A. Kimp
ton, Dean of Students; Paul C. Ed
wards, President of the Board of
Trustees; and Frank Walker, presi
dent of the Alumni Association.
All speakers discussed the im
portance of the private university as
ari essential of democracy. It was
emphasized thai a private institu-
I tion can only function from endow
j ments and gifts from alumni and
I friends.
I Dr. Sterling said that enrollment
could not be decreased too rapidly
j because of (he increased number of
| faculty members now employed. The
i boom in population in California
makes statement of a definite enroll
j mcnt policy impossible. Also un
known is the influence the current
■ trend toward emphasis on junior col
| leges will have on Stanford.
1 Concerning the elective system, Dr.
Sterling expressed the hope that
Stanford could keep down the amount
of courses offered and still maintain
a high quality in its curriculum.
Dean Kimpton emphasized the im
portance of faculty and students in
maintaining the hiph standards of
1 Stanford. He expressed his desire
that in the future Stanford would be
j more of a residence university. At
' the present time, little more than
half the men enrolled at Stanford arc
l living on the campus, including the
Village.
Hank Rosin, on behalf of the stu
dents, expressed a desire for pres
ervation of individualism in educa
tion, decreasing the number of stu
dents enrolled, and return to a resi
dence university.
The president of the Alumni As
j soeiation proposed a plan to better
[ co-ordin;«tc Stanford's alumni or
| ganizations. In this way the alumni
I could function more efficiently than it
j is now doing.
j Also included in the Alumni Con
| ference were an outdoor luncheon
I and band concert, and a barbecue
j dinner at Angel I Field.
The classes of 1900, 1904, and 15)17
i held reunions.
