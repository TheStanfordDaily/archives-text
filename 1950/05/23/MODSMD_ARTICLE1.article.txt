# TRUSTEES RAISE TUITION 10 PER CENT
## $220 Fee Set For Next Fall 
### 
An increase in tuition of $20 a quarter was announced today by
the Board of Trustees.
President Wallace Sterling, in announcing the Trustees' action,
said that the move is necesary to maintain a proper balance in
the University's carefully calculated budget fox 1950-51.
The 10 per cent increase, which will take effect fall quarter, will
place the University's tuition at $660 a year for all undergraduates
and most graduate students.
A comparable 10 per cent increase will affect the tuitions in the
Business and Medical Schools. The Business School tuition will
be raised from $213 to $235 a quarter, and the Medical School
tuition, from $233 to $260 a quarter.
Dr. Sterling said that the increase was voted by the Trustees
with the greatest reluctance and only after the most careful study
indicated that the move was imperative when fixed costs v/ere
compared with estimated income for the coming academic year.
Only the swollen enrollments characteristic of the postwar
years prevented the tuition from going higher earlier, Dr. Sterling
said. An enrollment of 7,500 students next fall compared to 8,400
in the fall of 1948-49.
Follows Other Universities
Dr. Sterling pointed out that several private Eastern institutions
comparable to Stanford had increased their tuition last year when
Stanford did not.
Dartmouth's current tuition and fees are $675; Cornell, $680;
and Princeton, $700. The yearly tuition and fees of other Eastern
private institutions are: Harvard, $655; Northwestern, $508; Yal*\
$623; and Columbia, $620. In several of these institutions, the tui
tion is higher if a student takes more than the normal academic:
load.
At the same time, Dr. Sterling announced that more money
would be available for University grants-in-aid and urged all stu
dents to contact the Student Aid Commission if they felt that th r *
tuition increase would create an impossible drain on their budgets,
A total of $290,000 for scholarships and grants-in-aid will
available next year compared to $190,000 for the current year.
The increase in funds available is due to additional gift scholar,
ships, and increased University funds appropriated lor scholar
ships and grants-in-aid.
Historically, the increase is the third for Stanford since 1945,
when the tuition was $444 a year. This was increased to $500 in
1946-47 and to $600 in 1948-49.
Harvard's charges were $415 in 1945-46, went to $455 in 1947-
48, $555 in 1948-49; and $655 in 1949-50. At Princeton, tuition and
fees were $450 in 1945-46; $660 in 1947-48; and $700 in 1949-50.
At Dartmouth, the cost was $450 in 1945-46; $550 in 1947-48; $600
in 1948-49; and $675 in 1949-50.
Increases in Scholarships
The tuition-financial situation was discussed yesterday after
noon at a meeting attended by Thomas A. Spragens, assistant to
the president; Dean Lawrence A. Kimpton; ASSU President Hank
Rosin; Ted Buttner, ASSU president-elect; Frederick O. Glover,
director of information; Jack Little, Daily editor; and John Lilien
thai, student manager.
Spragens said the Trustees felt they "would be mortgaging the
future of the University to borrow against the endowment." The
only possible source for essential funds was a tuition raise.
The 1950-51 budget, Spragens said, contains no outlays for
capital expenditures, only necessary costs.
Dean Kimpton said that scholarships would be increased by 10
per cent, up to a maximum $60 increase. The $100,000 of the in
crease in funds allocated to scholarships and grants-in-aid will bn
added to the total grants-in-aid.
Students finding themselves in need of funds should not hesi
tate to apply to the Student Aid Commission for assistance, Dean
Kimpton emphasized.
Vets Must Pay Increase
Many ol Stanford's 2,800 veterans will have to add the $20 a
quarter to the $33.35 they have been paying out of their own
pocket since September. 1948, if they don't want to accelerate
the use of their entitlement.
The veterans under the G1 Bill are allowed $166,85 a quartei,
or $500 for the academic year, by the government.
Veterans who wish to charge the $20 increase to the govern
ment and speed up the use of their entitlement will lose one day
for each extra $2.10 spent, or a total of 10 days a quarter. If the
government pays the entire $220 a quarter, the student will lose
26 days' entitlement each quarter.
The largest number of vets to be hit are in the graduate school. .
where 66 per cent of the enrollment is ex-servicemen and women
Thirty-one per cent of the upper division is vets, while the lower
division has only nine per cent veterans.
Stanford's veteran enrollment reach its peak in fall, 1047, when
4,426 veterans were enrolled. Ex-GI's planning to receive govern-

ment aid for schooling must being
their academic work before July 25,
1951, to benefit from the aid.
George D. Barahal, Stanford Vet
erans' Co-ordinator, advised vetei
ans who are running short of their
entitlement to pay the extra $53.35
themselves. He recommended that
veterans with more than enough en
titlement charge the increase to the
government.
Barahal said that vets who are bard
bit by the increase should investi
gate University loan facilities through
the office of the Men's Counselor, or
apply for a grant-in-aid.
