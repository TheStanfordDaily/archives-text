Eight Stanford student renters in
Palo Alto probably will receive more
than Si,ooo from their landlord even
though the rent controls have been
removed and most renters are dig
ing deep for extra money.
Federar housing authorities ruled
that the rent ceiling on the seven
room house was $69, while the
amount charged the students was
$175 a month.
Two of the student renters, Dick
Scott and Fred Champ, said they in
quired about the high rent earlier
this month when the group became
dissatisfied with the poorly furnished
house.
