# Groups Must Plan For Fall Publicity
## 
### 
Representatives of all Stanford
activities will meet in the Cardinals
room of the Old Union any time
from 2 to 5 p.m. tomorrow to draw
up plans for publicizing the activi
ties of their groups during pre-reg
week next fall.
Instead of the usual program of
placing tables in Union Court where
new students can get acquainted
with the various activities, Fred
Firestone, activities committee
chairman for pre-reg, is planning to
stage a series of promotion talks in
the individual living groups.
In order for groups to be included
in Ihe program, they must send a
representative to sign up, Firestone
said.
