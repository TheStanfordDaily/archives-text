# Melchior Has Wide Appeal
## 
### HOLLY BASTE 
Lauritz Melchior's recital last
night was programmed to appeal
to a varied audience.
Throughout the program, Mel
chior made the most of the dramatic
content of his selections. The fool
ing and the mood of the music was
never obscure to the audience.
But Melchior's voice is not quite
what it was in past years. In ten
der, lyrical passages he was quite
stiff and had considerable trouble
preventing cracking.
The Wagnerian excerpts from
"Tannhauser" and"The Flying
Dutchman" and the Schumann lied
er, giving the singer opportunity to
use his middle range in a strong,
dramatic way, were much more
successful.
Melchior ended with a group of
light numbers, including "Some En
chanted Evening" from "South Pa
cific." As is usually the case when
an opera singer does this type of
thing, the voice sounded too rich
and constrained for the music, and
the effect was one of incongruity.
Leonard Eisner's accompanying
was only mediocre. His solo pieces
were not artistically done, but the
dynamic exaggerations in the Cho
pin gave an original cast to these
hackneyed numbers.
