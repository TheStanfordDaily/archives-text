# Footprints Reappear!!
## 
### ART HENRY 
The Monster has finally come
down from Hoover Tower.
Awakening to a foggy May morn
ing yesterday, the Stanford campus
saw for the second time within a
year footprints on the west side of
the Library tower.
Speculations as to who, what, and
why soon were resolved by realiza
tion that this time the prints ran
down the tower. A year ago they
had gone up.
Only one conclusion was possible:
the Monster had finally descended.
The story of this Ghost of the
Tower begins last spring when bells
in the carillon rang after closing
hours.
Then on May 24, the first foot
prints were seen. Four of them,
very large, ran up the west side of
the tower.
A legend formed among students
that a Monster had made his way
up the side of the building. Inves
tigation revealed only a few strands
of rope (possibly shreds of his fur),
but the legend persisted.
Then yesterday morning the
earthward prints appeared, provid
ing questions and observations.
Last year there were four very
large prints, evenly spaced. This
year there were five smaller prints,
unevenly spaced.
Conclusion: the Monster was well
and healthy when he climbed the
Tower and after a year had become
so emaciated that he had shrunk,
and stumbled on his way down.
This observation is confirmed by
the change in position from the
center of the west face to the north
edee. The Monster had moved his
home from the large main cupola
to one of the four small points.
Why did he come down?
The best answer is that even
persons in (ivory) towers are not
insensible to current discussion.
The Monster had undoubtedly
heard of the proposal to open the
Tower on Sundays. His only re
maining flay of solitude was on the
verge of being taken away and he
decided to give up the whole works.
Another possible explanation of
his sudden departure is that he had
advance knwoledgc of the raise in
tuition here, and left to take cheap
er lodgings in a crumbling lower
class tower across the bay.
Besides it was drafty up there and
those birds . . .


VISUAL EVIDENCE of the Monster's descent from his lofty
heights is given above. Note especially the uneven second and
third steps, indicating how he tripped. One print is out of sight
behind the trees. —Daily photo by Art Henry

The Monster had undoubtedly
heard of the proposal to open the
Tower on Sundays. His only re
maining flay of solitude was on the
verge of being taken away and he
decided to give up the whole works.
Another possible explanation of
his sudden departure is that he had
advance knwoledgc of the raise in
tuition here, and left to take cheap
er lodgings in a crumbling lower
class tower across the bay.
Besides it was drafty up there and
those birds . . .


VISUAL EVIDENCE of the Monster's descent from his lofty
heights is given above. Note especially the uneven second and
third steps, indicating how he tripped. One print is out of sight
behind the trees. —Daily photo by Art Henry
