# ASSEMBLY
## Dr. Sterling To Discuss Tuition Raise 
### 
Dr. Wallace Sterling will point
out to a student assembly tomorrow
how the University's resources can
be channeled to fill the gaps in the
educational perspective of Stanford.
In his only address of the school
year directed to the student body,
at 7:30 p.m. in the Memorial Audi
torium, Dr. Sterling will outline the
tuition raise and the related prob
lems confronting the president of a
university. He will emphasize the
relation between financing the sys
tem and the level of education the
system can offer.
The inadequacy of student advis
ing, the criteria of merit in the
teaching profession, and the broad
issues of academic freedom are
among the main problems the pres
ident will take up before the stu
dents. The main part of the eve
ning will be devoted to questions
from the audience.
Dr. Sterling will describe Stan
ford's fight on two fronts in the field
of educational institutions. Stanford
competes with the "Antiochs and
Pomonas" whose strength is con
centrated on the undergraduate
level; state universities, at the same
time, can expand with a larger en
dowment in graduate study. Stan
ford's problem is to recruit fewer
resources into competition on both
levels.
Sydney Morgan will moderate
the question period following Dr.
Sterling's address.
