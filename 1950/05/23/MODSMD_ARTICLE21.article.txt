# The 						Victims Discuss The New Raise
## 
### 
Stanford students indicated they
were generally opposed to the Board
of Trustees' $20 a quarter tuition in
crease, although many indicated that
they could understand it as a neces
sary evil to ease the University's
financial burden.
Other students, on scholarships,
hoped that the grants would be in
creased. ($lOO,OOO will be added to
scholarship and grant-in-aid funds.)
Opinions ranged from "It's ridicu
lous" to "I guess it's all right." but.
none of the students was willing to
concede that the action was pleasing.

Chester Abend, senior from Stan
ford Village, showed concern for the
veterans. "The increase will mean a
considerable handicap to GI Bill stu
dents unless some adjustment is
made," Abend said.
A graduate student from an East
ern school said "there no justification
for the increase because schools of
equal quality don't charge even $200
a quarter now, and Stanford is not
that much better."
Midge Newell, junior, said, "I've
just been reading about the difficul
ties a private school faces, and about
the pitifully low teachers' salaries.
Therefore, I'm not against it if the
increase is Ihc only way."
"I don't like it, but the school must
need money or else tuition wouldn't
be raised. But I don't like it "
said Jean Denham, a freshman.
Scholarships
Carolyn Wolf and Carolyn T'eren,
both freshmen, wanted to know if
the increases are necessary, atid how
scholarships would be affected. They
said they thought the increase was
all right if scholarships are taken
into consideration.
Caroline Neilson, junior, said,
"Even $(500 is a tight squeeze. I don't
feel that tuition would be raised un
less there is a very good reason."
"Maybe I'll be going to Cal after
all," said sophomore Gil Clark. "I
hope scholarships will be raised also.
There's probably a good reason for
the increase."
"My father will never send ine
back," said one junior girl.
Chuck Nichols, senior, said he
didn't think the students should ob
ject until they found out more about
the University's financial condition.
