# Oh, No, Not Again

Today non-graduating Stanford students and
high school and junior college students who
have hopes of coming to the Farm, are faced
with the totally unexpected news that they'll
have to kick in an additional $20 per guarter
for the benefits of a Stanford education.
It's the third tuition boost in five years, and a
lot of people are wondering "Why?" and "How
will it affect us?" and "How will it affect Stan
ford?" Good guestions.
Here's how it looks to us.
In the first place, the increase is designed to
remove a delicit in the 1950 -51 budget for the
operation of the University. We have been as
sured that the budget was pared to the bone,
and that projected expenditures included
therein provide for no capital improvements,
only for the basic operation and maintenance
ot University facilities.
We are told that the budget is tight ... so
tight that the projected income over expense is
so infinitesimal as to make a business man
ager guake in his boots.
We have lurther been assured that every
other possible source ot income was carefully
investigated before the decision was made
"with the greatest reluctance" to boost tuition.
It was considered far better to follow this
course than to "mortgage the future ol the Uni
versity by borrowing against endowments to
underwrite the deficit."
At any rate, the tuition is going to be $060 a
year, not $600, beginning with Fall Quarter.
Next guestion. . . .
How will the boost affect students? We fig
ure that the sgueeze will be felt by from 20 to
30 per cent of the enrollment, Stanford is no
longer a "wealthy" school. Few universities
are. For many of us the GI Bill is running out,
and few of the incoming frosh will have help
under the Bill.
Some students who have been walking the
financial tight-rope will be forced to drop out
of school, and others who are close to the line
will in some cases drop out rather than attempt
to get the full benefits of a Stanford education
while struggling to make ends meet.
True, the administration recognizes this
situation. They have announced that grants
in aid and scholarships will be increased from
$190,000 to $290,000 to help meet the additional
needs of these students. This help is neces
sary; will it go far enough?
How will the tuition increase affect Stanford?

Well, as we have reported, it will keep the
University operating 'without a deficit budget.
The effect on the student body as a whole,
and thus on the University, is anyone's guess.
We wonder if it will have any efect on the Uni
versity's academic standards?
The budget has been based on an enroll
ment of 7,500. If students drop out because of
the tuition boost, more will have to be admitted
to make up the difference-.
Applications are off about 6 per cent for pros
pective men students and 3 per cent for wom
en. The nationwide decrease in college appli
cations, based on the number of College Board
Exams taken, is about 10 per cent. (College
Boards provide a pretty valid criterion tor com
parison in the case of Stanford because most
College Bdard exams are taken by applicants
to private institutions.) By comparison, this
puts Stanford in a good light.
However, when this drop in applications is
considered along with the possible necessity
of admitting more new students, it is obvious
that there could be a tendency to admit stu
dents on an entrance basis dropping nearer
the minimum reguirements. Over a period of
years this conceivably could injure the aca
dernic standards which Stanford has for so long
symbolized.
The administration does not believe this is
likely, although it is admitted that nobody can
predict the outcome witli complete certainty. It
would be a serious error not to consider ail
possible results.
The last tuition increase, we are told, did not
have any substantial results with respect to
students dropping out of school. Of course, it
would be impossible to estimate the number ol
prospective students thus lost.
The net impression of the tuition boost seems
to be just this:
1. It is necessary for the operation of the
University at present standards of educational
efficiency.
2. It will put the "sgueeze" on some stu
dents, and lorce them to transfer to other uni
versifies.
3. There is some concern with respect to the
effect on admissions, perhaps resulting in a
lowering of entrance reguirements.
4. It is generally considered to be an un
pleasant thing, however necessary it might be.
This, from the students' point of view, being a
gros.s understatement.
