To the Editor:
I have not some confusion concerning who has won
the Southern Division PCC baseball title. It is obvious
that not many students ere familiar with the new
PCC ruling which gives SC a handicap in all inter
collegiate competition due to their limited resources
jind difficulty in securing athletes. In baseball the
handicap is four games. This means that any team
has to place four games above SC in order to win the
championship. Stanford has no complaint, since we
missed by two full games.

Id track, the handicap is 10 points —this is an un
written understanding unlike the one concerning
baseball, consequently in close track meets with SC
there is sometimes much confusion iti arriving at th.*
correct winner.
1 hope this letter has cleared up any perplexity
concerning the PCC sport situation.

P.S. I must protest Stanford's Southern Division
PCC swimming championship, since SC wj: only
beaten by 11 points, and they are allowed u 1 j point
handicap. •*
