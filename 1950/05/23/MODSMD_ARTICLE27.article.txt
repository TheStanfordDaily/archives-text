(Editor's note: This is the sec

Business graduates may find an
accounting job a stop to the oak
paneled office of an executive; jour
nalism graduates may find small
towns the best place for job-hunt
ing; and other graduates may find
an examination the gateway to a
state Civil Service job.
The largest single career field
open to college graduates is in the
management and operation of busi
ness firms. It is likely that total
business employment will continue
to grow over the long run, causing
a moderate increase in the number
of executive jobs.
The trend toward greater special
ization and increased complexity in
business will also continue. This
has led to the wider use of account
ants, personnel workers, market re
search analysts, and sales execu
tives.
Although the demands for grad
uates of collegiate business courses
are expected to increase in future
years, there will continue to be se
vere competition for the better jobs
which iead to executive positions.
Present indications are that a
growing proportion of both top
level and specialized operating jobs

will go to business graduates. En
gineers, lawyers, and other profes
sional workers will be competing
strongly in many industrial fields.
Educational requirements for
business executive positions are be
ing increased. Eventually, college
graduation may be required lor
most jobs at the administrative
level.
The newspaper reporting field, al
ways highly competitive, is likely to
become more overcrowded in the
next year 01 two. But talented peo
ple will always have some chance of
breaking into the profession.
Fields related to newspaper work,
such as advertising, radio, and spe
cial publication, have had openings
for those wilh journalism training
or experience. These fields will
continue to take on some new grad
uates and a number of experienced
reporters each year, increasing re
placement needs on newspapers.
Opportunities with country pa
pers, trade papers, and foreign lan
guage papers are expected to be
better than with the dailies, where
openings are declining.
The State Personnel Board has
brought to attention opportunities
offered in California state govern
ment. Examinations scheduled this
spring have been arranged to per
mit seniors to qualify for appoint
ments in several fields immediately
fol low ing graduation.
