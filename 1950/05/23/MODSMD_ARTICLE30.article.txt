## 
### 
Genial Gene Martin, Stanford's
j snazzy pass-snagging end of 1947
I and '48, has signed a professional
football contract with the New York
Yankees, the Yanks announced yes
terday.
The Yankees, who have badly
needed pass catchers the last few
seasons, said via owner Ted Collins
that "Martin may be the pass
catching sleeper of the year."
What really sold Coach Norman
"Red" Strader on the G-foot 1-inch
195-pound flankman, however, was
(he glowing recommendation Mar
tin received from his ex - tutor,
Stanford end coach Mai Elward.
El ward claims that Alyn Beals, of
the San Francisco '49ersâ€”top fo(ur
year AAFC scorer, "couldn't touch
Martin the best day he ever saw."
Martin was a star quarterback at
Sioux City, la., Central High School
and played fullback and halfback at
Stanford before Coach Marchie
Schwartz asked him to switch to
end to fill a gap there in 1948. And
it was in this season that Martin
won honorable mention All-Coast.
He laid out last season to work for
the Master's degree in Physical Ed
ucation he will receive in June.
Martin will report to the Yankees
this summer.
