# SOFTBALL PLAYOFF
## Phi Delta Phi Battles Way to Mural Semi-finals 
### 
Errors, errors, errors! Hits, hits,
hits! Such was the tale yesterday
as Phi Delta Phi, national law fra
ternity, slam-banged its way into
the semi-finals of the all-University
mural softball playoffs by over
whelming Encina 3E 13 to 9.
Three-E handed its pitcher, Ro
land Conklin, a solid 4 to 0 lead in
the top of the first inning; but he
and they wilted quickly as soon as
the lawyers got to bat. Ron Hovey
was the big noise of this fast start
with a solid home run.
The Phi Delt offensive began with
two runs in their half of the initial
frame. Seven biggies were added in
the second. Then, after Encina 3E
had tied up the ball game by scoring
five times in the top of tbe third,
the Phi Delt boys poured across
four clinching tallies to end the
game.
Today ATO tangles with Biz
School II in the remaining quarter
final game. ATO boasts an impres
sive 3 to 0 shulout over Sigma Chi
in its previous playoff effort, where
as the Biz Boys drew a bye in their
first round.
In the lower bracket semi-final
contest Delta Tau Delta faces DU 11.
DU II downed El Toro in the first

round 7 to 3, then drew a bye. On
the other hand, the Delts drew a
first-round bye and pounded Kap
pa Sigma into submission 13 to 3 in
its quarter-final.
Tomorrow the winner of the Biz
School II vs. ATO struggle faces
Phi Delta Phi, and Friday is the
date of the all-University finals.
