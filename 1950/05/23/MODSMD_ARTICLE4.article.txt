WASHINGTON Criticizing Rus
sia for what he called a "willful
flouting" of the United Nations
charter, President Truman said to
day a strengthened UN —backed by
a more powerful West —will speed
the day when the Soviets will make
and keep agreements.
While Mr. Truman did not dis
cuss the issues raised by Soviet de
mands that Red China be admitted
to the world organization, it was
learned that the Western powers
have decided against throwing open
the door at this time.
The decision can be expected to
result in the indefinite continuation
of the Soviet bloc's boycott of ses
sions of UN agencies at which Na
tionalist China is represented.
