# De Ska Produces Triumph in 'Bicycle Thief; 'Powerful Document of Man's Inhumanity'
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
"The Bicycle Thief," now playing
at the Guild Theater, proves hap
pily that motion pictures could be
a lot better if those who make them
would climb down from their high
horse slogans about the movies be
ing "better than ever" and prove it.
This film, at least, is better, and

gives a boost to
the slogan with
out all the fan
fare and halder
dash usually as
sociated with
"better" films.
The story, di
rection, setting,
and cast, all

good, are Italian. The success is
international.

The story is concerned with a
man, Ricei, whose bicycle is stolen
just as he Rets a long-needed job
for which his bicycle is indispen
sable.
Ricci's frantic efforts to find the
bicycle provide the background for
the powerful theme which pervades
the picture: man's inhumanity to
man.
Social I!uin
Unlike "Paisan" or the more re
cent "Germany, Year Zero," the
picture does not depend principally
upon the ready-made devastation of
a shattered and ragged-clothed Eu
rope. Poverty, possible starvation,
self-preservation do play a part in
De Sica's realism. But "The Bicyclc
Thief" is not i\ documentary of Ger- j
man devastations, human or other
wise; it is a documentary of human
ruin, social ruin on the level where
it begins, with the individual.
R is this failure which opened the
gate for Hitler, and will again, per
haps, for any other save-the-world
faction.
Built on Human Nature
Human nature is the stuff of i
which De Sica builds his story. The I

picture abounds in memorable
characterizations, each of which
stands as sharp yet as complex as
[human nature itself is. Greed and
desperation stand beside shocking
| indifference, generosity beside an
, ger. A second and third viewing of
the picture would reveal other and
more subtle facets of Dc Sica's
memorable picture.
Especially penetrating portraits
are the relations between Ricci and
his small son, Bruno; the spectacle
of part - time soul - saving by the
precise and righteous "Christians"
in the poor-mission scene, the para
j sitic soothsayer who preys on hu
| man fear and despair.
Cast Fits Film
And finally, the cast distinguishes
j itself largely by fitting into the fab
ric of De Sica's completely natural
film. Bruno, the son, almost steals
the acting honors with his small
boy actions.
The picture should point Holly
i wood the way to more of the same
I excellence.
