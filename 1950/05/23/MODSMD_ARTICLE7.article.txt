WASHINGTONâ€”The seals were
ripped off the investigation record
of the hotly disputed Amerasia case
of 1945 in Congress today. It came
amid disputed talk of a "cover-up"
in the case which prompted Rep.
Brown (R., Ohio) to declare there
were House rumors that "the fix has
been put in again."
Brown spoke out after Rep.
Hobbs (D., Ala.) told the House he
believes there has been a connec
tion between the now defunct mag
azine Amerasia and Russia.
