# Frankenstein Strikes Rare Series Note
## 
### 
Critic Alfred Frankenstein of the
San Francisco Chronicle, who com
mented last night on "Contrasts in
Modern Music," achieved a kind of
unusual distinction among Tuesday
Evening Series speakers.
For music-art writer Frankenstein
told his Memorial Auditorium audi
ence:
1. That he almost called off his
campus appearance for fear of re
ceiving art "exceedingly frightful"
and searching academic examina
tion of his criticism;
2. That he had apparently forgot
ten an important document from
which he had intended to quote;
(Thereupon the speaker "pulled
a Frankenstein" and left his audi
ience staring while he searched un
successfully offstage for the elusive
item.) And,
3. That in his 15 years on the
Chronicle, he has attempted to "close
the gap that exists between con
temporary musical expression and its
appreciation by the musical public."
Talking in his typical off-the
shoulder manner over folded hands
and glinting glasses, the speaker
elucidated:
"When the avant garde of music
and his patrons begin to part com
pany, that is the time for the music
critic to close the gap . . . through
his expression, his enthusiasm . .
Moreover, critic Frankenstein saw
in the modern composer himself the
attempt to get closer to his audience
—the tendency to achieve a sense of
"social consciousness—not found in
the visual arts."
"Can you imagine Bach, Handel,
and Vivaldi sitting around a table
and discussing the composer and so
ciety?" the speaker asked. Yet today,
he continued, that very subject is
considered germane in many univer
sities.
Although we may not now see
genius in the works of the moderns,
Mr. Frankenstein reminded his lis
teners that it takes a vast number of
people—and quite possibly a very
long time—before a timeless compo
sition can be created and recognized
as such.
