# 'Cellar Pete' in Hospital
## 
### 
"I've had lots of men work with
me, but none of them has as many
friends as Pete."
"Known Pete since I came here as
a freshman four years ago. He al
ways takes the time to do the little
'extras' for you like putting in the
new flints you purchase for a ciga
rette lighter, or stopping to chat a
minute in the midst of a busy day."
These are the kind of comments
heard whenever the name of "Cel
lar Pete," more officially Peter Kecs
maat, is mentioned on the Farm.
Everyone from Mr. Gunthcr, man
ager of the Union, where Pete works
every day behind the counter in the
Cellar, to the individual student who
gets to know him over the years—
everyone, is a friend of Pete's.
Pete's friends have been mi.ss'ng
his cheery face behind the Cellar
counter tor the last two weeks.
Pete has been seriously ill in the
Palo Alto Hospital.
Stanford students have sent Pete
so many flowers that his hospital
ward is rapidly taking on the as
pect of a florist shop. Many stu
dents have also tried to visit him,
but his doctor is discouraging too
many visitors because talking puts
a strain on him.
Pete's doctor is unable to make
any positive predictions as to how
long it will be until Pete is better.
.Farm students are hoping to see
him back at the Cellar soon.— Bill

"CELLAR PETE," as he appears at his job behind the Cellar
counter. Pete's many friends have missed him during the past
two weeks because he has been seriously ill in the Palo Alto
Hospital. The number of flowers he Jias been getting from the
campus prove it will be only too glad to have him back on the
job.
