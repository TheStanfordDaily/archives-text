## New Men's Housing Plan Drawn Up 
### 
New freshmen and eating club
members will take over all but 10
places in Toyon Hall next fall. Oth
er men desiring to live in a campus
dorm will be forced to enter a
drawing for places in Stern.
New freshmen will get 150 of the
280 vacancies, eating clubs 120.
Excom members found it neces
sary to approve the new housing
plan last night after learning that
University plans to admit 1,000
freshmen would make the previous
ly approved housing plan obsolete.
Excom adopted recommendations
of Housing Committee Chairman
Ted Roelfscma by a vote of 6 to 1,
with two abstentions, after amend
ing them to assure next year's
sophomores 10 per cent of the space
available at Stern.
Roelfscma recommended that the
Toyon preferential list be dropped
and the men who didn't sign up on
the Stern list be allowed to do so.
He further recommended that eat
ing clubs be allowed 120 spaces in
Toyon, the same as this year.
Others Must IVlovc
All but 10 men now living in
Toyon and planning to live there
next fall will be forced to move out
of the hall. These men will be given
a preference of living in Stern, ac
cording to the most quarters spent
in Toyon. If the Stern quota from
Toyon is- unfilled, the Toyon men
will be forced to move from the
hall, starting with those who have
the least number of quarters' resi
dence.
Men's Halls Representative Gregg
Bemis expressed bitterness toward
the newly revealed plans of the
Board of Admissions to admit 1,000
freshmen, and later recommended
that the surplus freshmen be sent to
the Village.
"I'd like to throw this thing right
hack at them (the Board of Ad
missions) and let them work it out,"
said Bemis, who cast the lone dis
senting vote. "I don't think they're
playing ball with us."
Rosin's View
Student Body President Hank
Rosin said he thought such action
would be a mistake. "I'm sure the
administration is sweating this thing
out as much as we are," he said.
Off - campus Representative Bill
Kea asked that at least some of
this year's freshmen be given a
chance to live on campus.
He was backed up by Rosin, who
said that the third characteristic of
Stanford's residence system would
be defeated by forcing the sopho
mores to live off campus or in the
Village if they could not get into
an eating club or fraternity.
Excom decided in favor of this
view over the opinion of Graduate
representative Hank Grandin that
men with six or seven quarters off
campus should be given preference
over the new sophomores.
The sophomores will fill 23 Stern
Hall vacancies.
Foreign' Scholarships
Excom took a wincing glance at
the compact ASSU budget for the j
coming year and voted to subsidize
one more foreign scholarship stu
dent, making a total of six for
1950-51.
The action was taken on the basis
of a request from Phil Nielsen,
chairman of the program, who re
potted that the response of living
groups had provided an additional
$1,075 in room, board, and allow
ances for the program.
Student manager John Lilienthal
said $800, the ASSU's share of ex
penses, could come out of the con
tingency fund.
Budgets Approved
Excom then approved the itemized
budgets of Rally Committee, AWS,
Cardinals, the Debate Society, lIR,
Metl's Council, Yell Leaders, and
Men's Glee.
Lilienthal announced that the
Board of Trustees had approved the
reallocation of student funds to give
The Daily $1 more during the three
regular quarters and an additional
85 cents in the summer.
To make ends meet, 25 cents a
quarter will he taken from each
man's Stanford Union fee and each
woman's Women's Clubhouse fee.
In addition, 10 cents will be taken
from the ASSU general fund allot
ment in the summer.
Approval of the new athletic by
laws was postponed because of the
lack of a necessary quorum.
ASSU President-elect Ted BuLtner
announced the appointment of Jesse
Cone and Tom Shaw as student body
representatives on the new Stanford
Athletic Board for next year.
