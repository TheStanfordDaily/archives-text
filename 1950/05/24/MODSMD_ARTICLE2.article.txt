# Acheson to Report
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
State Acheson is going to deliver
a public report May 31 on the Lon
don cold war strategy talks, then
pull down the blinds for a secret
question - and - answer session with
Congressmen.
The lawmakers, cynically accus
tomed to Washington's porous walls,
anticipated extensive leakage from
the confidential conference.
