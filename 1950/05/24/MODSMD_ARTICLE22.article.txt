# Stanford Makes Plans for Land Development
## 
### 
Stanford has various alternative
plans on paper for the future devel
opment, of University-owned prop
erty to bolster the University's in
come.
Of main interest is a 50-acre area
south of Palo Alto, adjoining the
railroad cut-off to Los Altos, which
the University hopes eventually to
develop for light industry which
will harmonize with a general plan
for indust rial-com mcrcia I -residen
tial improvement of .'550 acres of
suoth-of-campus land.
IVlenlo Park Considered
A second area under considera
tion is in Metilo Park, where the
University owns land between El
Camino Heal and the Southern Pa
cific right - of - way, north of San
Francisquito Creek. Informal plans
call for commercial development in
this section.
Paul C. Edwards, president of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, esti
mated at an alumni panel Saturday
that if Stanford lands such as these
were put to proper use, they would
producc as much as $1 million in
come annually.
The University planners have in
dicated a desire to develop the
souther nproperty 112» rhigh - caliber
industries which would have no
noise or smoke to bother nearby
residential areas.
Commercial Project Planned
Another portion of the entire 350-
acre area is planned for modern
commercial purposes, with the
stress on adequate parking space off
the highway. West of the area
would he multiple - dwelling units,
while the area nearer the foothills
would be developed into one-family
residential area.
The development of this area is
still well in the future. The Univer
sity must first line up acceptable
firms to use the property, then ap
proach the county for zoning. Not
until then can actual development
proceed.—A. M.
