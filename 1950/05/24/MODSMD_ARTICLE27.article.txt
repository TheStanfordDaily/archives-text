## About Donald Close and Bilbo 
### 
To the Editor:
One thing Mr. Donald E. Close conceals concerning
his revelations of Howard University's educational
policy is that he is quoting that well-known Dixie
crat, the late Senator Theodore F. Bilbo of Mississippi,
who, in his long senatorial career, did so much to
distinguish himself and his country. This fact should
be announced to give Mr. Close's information the
credence it deserves.
Bilbo, known, as is Mr. Close, for his "objectivity,"
quotes a "resume" for which he otters no citation, of
a speech by Professor Hansberry of Howard Uni
versity made before the Institute of Race Relations in
Washington. The resume, taken in its entirety, ap
peal's to be an over-enthusiastic report of speeches to
an interracial meeting. It says that Dr. Hansberry
"also presented in a clear style the migration of the
population in the Sahara region of Africa (and now
the Sahara desert) to Europe and Asia, when this
itgion started drying up and turning into a huge
desert. As a result of climatic conditions, Negro-type

people bleached out in Europe and became the White
people."
There are several things which would lead a reader
to exercise caution in accepting this as an accurate
statement of the anthropologist's speech. It is used
by Bilbo. Its source is unidentified. Its English is
clumsy. There is nothing in it to suggest that the re
porter understands he is dealing very summarily with
complex anthropological facts. The whole article (or
what Bilbo includes) breathes an exuberance which
is likely to produce overstatement. Its accuracy in
reporting this speech is certainly highly dubious.
From this Bilbo concludes that Howard is teaching
that Negroes descend from Whites. Bilbo, and his
Stanford counterpart Mr. Close, might be expected
to use unreliable reports to aid them in the conclusion
they desire to make. But if they do they must submit
to an inevitable exposure of their mutual intellectual
limitations. Accusing a college of a specific teaching
policy on the basis of such a flimsy and suspect sec
ondary source is an act worthy, perhaps, of Senator
Bilbo, but not, I hope, of a university student.
