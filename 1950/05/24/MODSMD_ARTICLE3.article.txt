# German Red March
## 
### 
HFItUN — East Germany's blue
shirted Communist Youth got a
warning from their own police to
day to keep out of Western Berlin
on their Whitsuntide demonstration
march.
This put the final damper on
boasts from some Communist quar
ters that half a million young Reds
— whose advance formations al
ready were massing here — would
storm all Berlin this weekend.
