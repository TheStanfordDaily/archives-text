# Research Institute Assists Many Industries in West

### SKIPPY LEWIS 
The applied research center for
the West. That is the Stanford Re
search Institute. The Institute's
purpose is to provide research fa
cilities for all major types of indus
try.
Chartered in 194U as a non-profit,
independent organization, the In
stitute offers confidential service
and complete patent protection to
any individual or group with prob
lems which might be expected to
yield to the research approach. It
is unique in that it offers business
and industrial economic research as
well as physical and mechanical re
search. Many companies have used
the Institute to supplement and ac
celerate their own research and to
check results.
The Stanford Research -Institute
has grown rapidly. Last year two
new field laboratories—in Pasadena
and Portland—and a Los Angeles
division were established. Thirty
seven new staff members were cho
sen 011 the basis of demonstrated
original research thinking and
practicality of approach.
Six Departments
The Institute is divided into six
research departments and several
general service departments. The
departments function co-operative
ly, but are independently organized.
They are:
Department of Business and Ap
plied Mechanics, Department of
Applied Physics, Department of
Business and Industrial Economics,
Department of Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering, Department
of Electrical Engineering, and De
partment of Geophysics and Geol
ogy.
During 1949 four laboratories
were enlarged or added to the In
stitute. The Electronic Tube Re

search and Development Labora
tory has done much work on tele
vision picture tubes. The Air and
Water Pollution Laboratory is at
tempting to develop methods for re
duction and possible utilization of
air and water contaminants.
The United States Army Ord
nance Department lias loaned its
Precision Gage Laboratory to the
Institute. It is one of two such
laboratories on the West Coast. The
equipment in the laboratory is val
ued at more than one-quarter mil
lion dollars.
Cancer Research
The Experimental Biology Labo
ratory is doing vital and timely re
search on growth and the condi
tions associated with tumors and
cancer formation.
Teamwork is essential in research
and so the Research Associate plan
was established. Under this plan
any new ideas or developments,
other than work done on sponsored
projects, are offered to the Associate
members in advance of their public
release. By the end of 1949, twelve
prominent Western companies and
individuals had joined the Associate
plan.
Maurice Holland, widely known
industrial research adviser, has
stated publicly that "the phenome
nal growth of the Institute's re
search in two years is the most im
pressive single performance in in
dustrial research in the last 25
years."
