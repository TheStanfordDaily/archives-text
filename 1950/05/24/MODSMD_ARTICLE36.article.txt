Stanford University Hospital doc
tors have given eyesight to another
patient — this time a 16-year-old
Fairfax youth who can't wait to
finish high school and get to col
lege.
The boy is Don Ertman, who be
gan to have trouble with his eyes
at the age of five and who has been
living in almost total darkness for
the past year.
Two weeks ago, doctors at the
Stanford Eye Bank transplanted
into Don's left eye a cornea from
the eye of a 59-year-old San Fran
cisco woman who had died 24 hours
earlier.
Young Ertman will have to wear
an aluminum cup with minute pores
over his eye for the next two weeks
to shield it from the light. With the
help of glasses, his eyesight will be
almost perfect. A similar operation
is planned for the other eye *when
the boy reaches 21.
