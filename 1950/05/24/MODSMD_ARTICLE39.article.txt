# Village Roused By Indoor Rain Near Midnight
## 
### 
Winnipeg-like floods hit the Vil
lage lute Monday night as Building
3128 was deluged with water when
the sprinkler system went off in one
of the rooms.
Torrents of water poured down,
completely soaking the belongings
of the occupants of the room, and
then spread down the hall and into
several other rooms.
The Menlo Park Fire Department,
answering a general alarm, came to
the rescue armed with mops,
brooms, shovels, and sawdust to
stem the rising water.
Through a misunderstanding, the
firemen thought there was a fire in
the dining hall. By the time they
arrived at .the scene of the trouble,
water was at least an inch deep on
the Hoor, and still coming down.
Neither occupant of the room was
present when the sprinklers went
off about 12:15 a.m. Burned news
papers found in the room clearly in
dicate<4 that the sprinkler system
had been deliberately set off, ac
cording to the Menlo fire chief who
answered the call.
The alarm brought four pieces of
equipment and about 25 firemen, as
well as scores of Village residents
who were attracted by the commo
tion.
But one student remained sound
asleep in his room, entirely un
aware of what was going on, while
several firemen busily mopped up
water around his bed.
