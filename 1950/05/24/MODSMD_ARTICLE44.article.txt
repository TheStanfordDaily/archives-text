# PCC TRACK CHAMPIONSHIP
## No. Div. Teams Can Help Break Troy's Win Streak 
### JOHN BREIER 
An occurrence that has not hap
pened since 1928, namely USC los
iug a PCC championship, might
come about Saturday in Berkeley
when the ten Conference schools
got together for their family feud.
For nine straight meets the
mighty Trojans have walked oft
with the title. Before that, because
of the two interruptions, one must
go back to the records of the 1928
meet to find another winner —22
years ago. Last year USC scored 71
points to Stanford's 42.
Troy's downfall will come about
only if the long, middle distance,
and hurdlers of Ihe northern schools
can paii - with California to cut
down the points that would nor
mally .go to USC. II these men come
through, Stanford could win the
meet.
Trials a( 4
Qualifying trials will Le run off
Friday afternoon at 4 in California's
Edwards Track Stadium. Finals will
begin Saturday at 2.
USC Coach Jess Hill has come
forth with the announcement that
lJob Newcomb (4:12 7), the Ore
gon-born Indian, will join Wally
Wilson (4:10.1) in the mile. This
could result in a one-two for the
Trojans unless Cal's Paul Mello
(4:15.4), Oregon's Jack Hutchins
(4:18.3), •or Idaho's Warren Johan
son (4:19.1) come through.
The end result may well be the

fastest mile ever run by a PCC col
legian. Either Mello or Newcomb
could push each other so that Lou
Zamperini's 4:W>.B top mark would
be equaled or bettered. This will re
quire the best in weather and con
ditioning, though.
Again in the 880, USC could make
a three- or four-man show of it with
Boh Pruitt, Wally Wilson, Bob
Chambers, and John Wehking. All
four have run under 1:54 with
Pruitt's 1:52 the best time recorded
in the Conference.
Miller May Surprise
The anti-Troy coalition of Wash
ington's Jack Hensey (1:53.9), Cal's
Tom Clink (1:54) and Phil Arnot
(1:54.3) are the logical men to
break the Troy monopoly if it is to
be broken. UCLA's surprising cap
tain, Jack Miller (1:54.8) could
come through if his relay times of
the past two weeks are any indica
tions of improvement.
The two hurdle events, the other
"crucials" in which Troy points

must be whittled down, lack the
possible candidates for upset nods.
Washington's Jack Burke ran : 14. 3
and:23.6 last week—good times for
Northern Division men. But these
marks are far off those of USC's
Dick Attlesey (:13.5, 23.1).
Behind Attlesey, Troy can field
Jack Barnard, Al Lawrence, and
Ron Frazier.
Rademaker May Score
Cal's Ted Rademaker, if he has
recovered from an injury and can
live up to :14.G and:23.4 marks,
could cause trouble along with
Burke. Otherwise il will be up to
Idaho's Keith Bean to help Cards
Gay and Bob Bryan. Bill Storum
could count.
In Saturday's final events, five
places will score on a 5-4-3-2-1 ba
sis. The first three men in each
event will win the right to repre
sent the PCC against the Big Nine
at Wisconsin on June 21.
The biggest problem at the mo
ment for the coaches is how to pare
their squads down to the 18-man
limit that is imposed on each school.
USC's Jess Hill will have to leave
men behind in some events who
could be expected to take thirds.
Hoff Out
But this overall strength of USC
does not speak ill of the Conference.
If the weather is right, several meet
records may be broken. Last year,
only Otis Chandler cracked a pre
vious record with a 54-ft. 9'A-in.
put.. He has hit 55 ft. 8% in. already
this year. Attlesey could also beat
the:23.4 low hurdles mark.
But prospect of a win over USC
was dampened with the news that
ace 440 man Larry Hoff, winner of
last year's PCC quarter in Seattle,
would never run again for Stan
ford. A second operation was need
ed on his foot, thus eliminating any
chance of his competing in the
NCAA meet.

the past two weeks are any indica

The two hurdle events, the other
"crucials" in which Troy points

must be whittled down, lack the
possible candidates for upset nods.
Washington's Jack Burke ran : 14. 3
and:23.6 last week—good times for
Northern Division men. But these
marks are far off those of USC's
Dick Attlesey (:13.5, 23.1).
Behind Attlesey, Troy can field
Jack Barnard, Al Lawrence, and
Ron Frazier.
Rademaker May Score
Cal's Ted Rademaker, if he has
recovered from an injury and can
live up to :14.G and:23.4 marks,
could cause trouble along with
Burke. Otherwise il will be up to
Idaho's Keith Bean to help Cards
Gay and Bob Bryan. Bill Storum
could count.
In Saturday's final events, five
places will score on a 5-4-3-2-1 ba
sis. The first three men in each
event will win the right to repre
sent the PCC against the Big Nine
at Wisconsin on June 21.
The biggest problem at the mo
ment for the coaches is how to pare
their squads down to the 18-man
limit that is imposed on each school.
USC's Jess Hill will have to leave
men behind in some events who
could be expected to take thirds.
Hoff Out
But this overall strength of USC
does not speak ill of the Conference.
If the weather is right, several meet
records may be broken. Last year,
only Otis Chandler cracked a pre
vious record with a 54-ft. 9'A-in.
put.. He has hit 55 ft. 8% in. already
this year. Attlesey could also beat
the:23.4 low hurdles mark.
But prospect of a win over USC
was dampened with the news that
ace 440 man Larry Hoff, winner of
last year's PCC quarter in Seattle,
would never run again for Stan
ford. A second operation was need
ed on his foot, thus eliminating any
chance of his competing in the
NCAA meet.

go back to the records of the 1928
meet to find another winner —22
years ago. Last year USC scored 71
points to Stanford's 42.
Troy's downfall will come about
only if the long, middle distance,
and hurdlers of Ihe northern schools
can paii - with California to cut
down the points that would nor
mally .go to USC. II these men come
through, Stanford could win the
meet.

Qualifying trials will Le run off
Friday afternoon at 4 in California's
Edwards Track Stadium. Finals will
begin Saturday at 2.
USC Coach Jess Hill has come
forth with the announcement that
lJob Newcomb (4:12 7), the Ore
gon-born Indian, will join Wally
Wilson (4:10.1) in the mile. This
could result in a one-two for the
Trojans unless Cal's Paul Mello
(4:15.4), Oregon's Jack Hutchins
(4:18.3), •or Idaho's Warren Johan
son (4:19.1) come through.
The end result may well be the

fastest mile ever run by a PCC col
legian. Either Mello or Newcomb
could push each other so that Lou
Zamperini's 4:W>.B top mark would
be equaled or bettered. This will re
quire the best in weather and con
ditioning, though.
Again in the 880, USC could make
a three- or four-man show of it with
Boh Pruitt, Wally Wilson, Bob
Chambers, and John Wehking. All
four have run under 1:54 with
Pruitt's 1:52 the best time recorded
in the Conference.
Miller May Surprise
The anti-Troy coalition of Wash
ington's Jack Hensey (1:53.9), Cal's
Tom Clink (1:54) and Phil Arnot
(1:54.3) are the logical men to
break the Troy monopoly if it is to
be broken. UCLA's surprising cap
tain, Jack Miller (1:54.8) could
come through if his relay times of
the past two weeks are any indica
tions of improvement.
The two hurdle events, the other
"crucials" in which Troy points

must be whittled down, lack the
possible candidates for upset nods.
Washington's Jack Burke ran : 14. 3
and:23.6 last week—good times for
Northern Division men. But these
marks are far off those of USC's
Dick Attlesey (:13.5, 23.1).
Behind Attlesey, Troy can field
Jack Barnard, Al Lawrence, and
Ron Frazier.
Rademaker May Score
Cal's Ted Rademaker, if he has
recovered from an injury and can
live up to :14.G and:23.4 marks,
could cause trouble along with
Burke. Otherwise il will be up to
Idaho's Keith Bean to help Cards
Gay and Bob Bryan. Bill Storum
could count.
In Saturday's final events, five
places will score on a 5-4-3-2-1 ba
sis. The first three men in each
event will win the right to repre
sent the PCC against the Big Nine
at Wisconsin on June 21.
The biggest problem at the mo
ment for the coaches is how to pare
their squads down to the 18-man
limit that is imposed on each school.
USC's Jess Hill will have to leave
men behind in some events who
could be expected to take thirds.
Hoff Out
But this overall strength of USC
does not speak ill of the Conference.
If the weather is right, several meet
records may be broken. Last year,
only Otis Chandler cracked a pre
vious record with a 54-ft. 9'A-in.
put.. He has hit 55 ft. 8% in. already
this year. Attlesey could also beat
the:23.4 low hurdles mark.
But prospect of a win over USC
was dampened with the news that
ace 440 man Larry Hoff, winner of
last year's PCC quarter in Seattle,
would never run again for Stan
ford. A second operation was need
ed on his foot, thus eliminating any
chance of his competing in the
NCAA meet.
