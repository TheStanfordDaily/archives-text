# Sports THE STANFORD DAILY
## Cardinal Nine Taken 8 to 6 by USF Dons 
### EARL ODELL 
In the face of a small hurricane,
the USF Dons yesterday defeated
the CIBA champion, Stanford, 8 to
'6. Winds of 10 to 15 miles an hour
kept pushing the long right field flies
almost back to first and second base.
The gi me was noticeably lacking
in spirit and "push," and little cham
pionship form was shown by the In
dians. Although Coach Everett Dean
threw his first team before the Dons
with the exception of catcher Bill
Herron, who was ably replaced by
Dick Corzine, a sophomore who has
seen little action this year, and, ol
course, his best pitchers, the team
felt little need to "go all out" and con
sequently wound up on the short end
of the final score.
Jim Clay pool Starts
Jim Claypool, the starting Card
pitcher, started out well enough,
putting the Dons down in one-two
three order with the help of a Klein
to-Melton-to-Cameron play in the
first inning, as Len Kurp of USF tried
to ;.trt tch a double into a triple, but
he bogged down in the third frame
win n the Dons found their bats and
began putting the horsehide into the
outfield to the tune of four hits and
three runs and one Stanford error.
Cameron Scores First
After that things quieted down for
awhile except for a brief Hurry in
the Indians' fourth and fifth innings
in which they managed to scrape up
a run in each frame. The fourth in
ning started out with p single by

Bruce Cameron followed by another
single by Charlie Cole. Bud Klein
dropped a nice bunt in front of the
plate to put Cameron on third and
Cole on second. Dave Melton's long
fly to left gave Cameron enough time
to tag up lor the first Card run.
In the (ifth frame Torn. Shaw's sin
gle was followed by another single
by pitcher Jim Claypool coring
Shaw.
Errors Aid Dons
The Dons broke loose again in the
sixth inning with four mure hits aided
by two Card errors, finishing the
frame with five runs.
Claypool, however, was replaced
by Rog Osenbough, who worked the
eighth and ninth innings. Rog, inci
dentally, turned in a fine perform
ance for the day, and will probably
see a lot of action next year, being a
sophomore at present.

to-Melton-to-Cameron play in the
first inning, as Len Kurp of USF tried
to ;.trt tch a double into a triple, but
he bogged down in the third frame
win n the Dons found their bats and
began putting the horsehide into the
outfield to the tune of four hits and
three runs and one Stanford error.
Cameron Scores First
After that things quieted down for
awhile except for a brief Hurry in
the Indians' fourth and fifth innings
in which they managed to scrape up
a run in each frame. The fourth in
ning started out with p single by

Bruce Cameron followed by another
single by Charlie Cole. Bud Klein
dropped a nice bunt in front of the
plate to put Cameron on third and
Cole on second. Dave Melton's long
fly to left gave Cameron enough time
to tag up lor the first Card run.
In the (ifth frame Torn. Shaw's sin
gle was followed by another single
by pitcher Jim Claypool coring
Shaw.
Errors Aid Dons
The Dons broke loose again in the
sixth inning with four mure hits aided
by two Card errors, finishing the
frame with five runs.
Claypool, however, was replaced
by Rog Osenbough, who worked the
eighth and ninth innings. Rog, inci
dentally, turned in a fine perform
ance for the day, and will probably
see a lot of action next year, being a
sophomore at present.
