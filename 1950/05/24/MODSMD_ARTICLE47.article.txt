# INTRAMURAL SOFTBALL
## DU's Blanked by Delts; ATO's Drop Biz School 
### BILL WOOD 
Winding up their share of the
mural softball semi-finals yester
day, a red-hot Delta Tau Delta nine
downed their Delta Upsilon oppo
nents by a lopsided 13 to 0 score.
Each of the Delts had his share in
their victory, as one after another
of DU chucker Tom Wood's pitches
was blasted into the field for bases.
Doing more than his share for the

Delts, hurler Gus Chavalas held his
opponents practically powerless in
allowing only three hits during the
entire seven innings.
From the first inning on, the Delt
nine displayed their exceptional
fielding ability by putting down the
DU's in short order with a double
play and a caught fly in center field.
However, the DU's showed that
they were no amateurs in the game
either, and throughout the first two
frames it was a scoreless ball game.
John Hail Homers
The Delts showed their rivals
their heels in the bottom of the
third though, and the track meet
was On. With two away, John Hall
("when I hit 'em they stay hit")
banged out a homer into deep left
field. The next batter, Ken Rose,
doubled to left, but he had little
time to catch his breath before "01-
lie" Mattson blasted out another
round tripper to clean the bases.
As if that weren't enough for one
inning, hurler Chavalas added in
sult to the DU's injury by racking
up his own four-bagger.
ATO's Win
It was a good day lor the ATO's
yesterday too, as the battlin' Brad
shaws led their house brothers to
a ti to 2 win over the Biz School
softballers. Brothers Jack and Dick
shared in the pitching honors of the
afternoon, holding their grad rvials
to three hits. Dave Hoffman topped
the mound for the losers.
Their two runs were the first
scored against the ATO's this year!
