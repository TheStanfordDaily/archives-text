on Capitol Hill today as officials
disclosed that the FBI sifted
through a list of 1,200 persons to
bring about the arrest of Harry
Gold.

question" by FBI agents trapped
Go'd and led to his reported con
fession of serving as a go-between
in a Soviet espionage ring.

biochemist, is being held under
heavy guard in Philadelphia in de
fault' of $100,000 bail.

with the arrest of Gold.
