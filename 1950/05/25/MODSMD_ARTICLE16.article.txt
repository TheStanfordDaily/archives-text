# Theta Chi Reconstruction Begins
## 
### 
If the Thela Chi house looks like
it's standing on stilts, it's only tem
porary. Workmen have started a
$(52,000 reconstruction job on the
front half of the building. In five
months, the white clapboard will
have given way to a tile - roofed,
Spanish exterior.
The job will complete the renova
tion of the house, begun in 1935
when the rear half of the building
was rebuilt and enlarged at a cost
of $28,000. From that time until
now, the Theta Chi house on the
corner of Alvarado Row and Ar
guello Street has remained a kind

of platypus: half now stucco, in
Spanish style, and half ancient
white clapboard.
Now an 18-foot extension of the
living room will change the L
shaped house into a U. French win
dows downstairs wi I open onto a
long, balustraded tcrrace stretching
across the front of the building. In
side, Philippine mahogany wood
work will decorate the lower floor.
When finished, the house will be
one of the largest on campus, hold
■ ing more than 42 men. "The Span- !
! ish style wlil be in keeping with the j

Stanford plan of architecture," said
K. L. Edmonds, '2,'{, president of the
A'pha Epsilon (Stanford's Theta
Chi chapter) Alumni Association.
"II will he one of the finest plants,
not only on this campus, but on the
Pacific Coast."
From the time the mortgage on
the 1935 remodeling was paid, all
available Theta Chi money has been
shunted into a building fund, now
totaling $24,000. Loans from the
University and the national chapter
of Theta Chi make up the balance
| of the cost.

Art Brown, president of the local
chapter, praised the efforts of Ed
monds, W. W. Owen, and Dean
Morrison, alumni officers; and Jim
Crooker, last year's Theta Chi pres
ident. Without their hard work al
negotiating and money - raising,"
he said, "we wouldn't he building
yet."
The drawing above, by Lee Mil
ler, shows how the house will look
shortly after the opening of fall
quarter. Contractor for the recon
struction is R. L. Wilson of San
Francisco. Architect is Will G. Cor
lett of Oakland.

work will decorate the lower floor.
When finished, the house will be
one of the largest on campus, hold
■ ing more than 42 men. "The Span- !
! ish style wlil be in keeping with the j

Stanford plan of architecture," said
K. L. Edmonds, '2,'{, president of the
A'pha Epsilon (Stanford's Theta
Chi chapter) Alumni Association.
"II will he one of the finest plants,
not only on this campus, but on the
Pacific Coast."
From the time the mortgage on
the 1935 remodeling was paid, all
available Theta Chi money has been
shunted into a building fund, now
totaling $24,000. Loans from the
University and the national chapter
of Theta Chi make up the balance
| of the cost.

Art Brown, president of the local
chapter, praised the efforts of Ed
monds, W. W. Owen, and Dean
Morrison, alumni officers; and Jim
Crooker, last year's Theta Chi pres
ident. Without their hard work al
negotiating and money - raising,"
he said, "we wouldn't he building
yet."
