# Toyon Independents Fume, Situation Looks Improved
## 
### 
The men's housing situation is not as bad this morning as it
seemed at first.
Richard L. Balch, chief counselor for men, said yesterday,
"Every effort will be made to take care of the men in Toyon who
want to stay." He optimistically looked at this year's record.

Toyon was prepared to house 100
freshmen this year and only 50 had
to move in.
Balch estimated that treshmen
might, actually move into Toyon
rather than the 150 expected by
Housing Com.
After the announcement Tuesday
night that 150 freshmen would move
into Toyon next fall along with 120
eating club members and about a

dozen independents, a wave of gen
eral protest swept the hall.
Busy Offices
All day, men affected by there- |
port filed into the offices of Balch i
and Mrs. Dorothy Loofbourow, di- \
rector of Toyon.
The ruling by Men's Housing ]
Committee was necessitated by the
administration's announcement that
approximately 1,000 freshmen have
been admitted to maintain the Stan
ford enrollment level at 7,500.
There are 6.1 non-eating club men
living in Toyon who intend to re
main in University dormitory space.
Ted Roelfsema, Housing Com
chairman, said volunteers from this j
group of independents will he asked ■
to move to Stern Hall. If there is [
not room left in Toyon for those |
who cannot afford to move to Stern,
they will be forced to moved.
George Engstrom, Toyon presi
dent and an eating club member,
realized the importance of placing
all freshmen in campus residences,
but he said he hoped an arrange
ment can be worked out more satis
factory to the independents.
Roelfsema clarified the number of
sophomores who can be admitted to
Stern next fall. He said they will j
get ten per cent of the vacancies in |
Stern after the Toyon "extras" have
moved. One hundred thirty vacan- |
cies are expected in Stern.
I>ess Than 1.000
Balch stated that 1,000 men are
not expected to show up in the fall.
All housing figures have been com
puted on the basis of 700 n°w fresh
men after an anticipated drop of !!0
per cent, among those who actually
are admitted. The greater the drop |
in the freshman class, the better
will tie the possibilities for Toyon I
independents remaining in the 23R j
Toyon spaces.
Of the 700 freshmen expected, j
Housing Com has estimated 50 wdl J
commute from homes in the imrne- I
diate area, 150 will live in Toyon, I
and 500 will occupy Encina.
Balch has sent out a large number j
of letters to prospective freshmen j
from the Peninsula area telling !
them that due to crowded condi- |
tions many of them may have to j
live at home.
Men who have signed the Toyon ;
housing list must sign the compos
ite Toyon-Stern list next week be
cause the Toyon preferential list
has been dropped. The sign-up day j
will be announced later.

Men who have signed the Toyon ;
housing list must sign the compos
ite Toyon-Stern list next week be
cause the Toyon preferential list
has been dropped. The sign-up day j
will be announced later.
The men's housing situation is not as bad this morning as it
seemed at first.
Richard L. Balch, chief counselor for men, said yesterday,
"Every effort will be made to take care of the men in Toyon who
want to stay." He optimistically looked at this year's record.

Toyon was prepared to house 100
freshmen this year and only 50 had
to move in.
Balch estimated that treshmen
might, actually move into Toyon
rather than the 150 expected by
Housing Com.
After the announcement Tuesday
night that 150 freshmen would move
into Toyon next fall along with 120
eating club members and about a

dozen independents, a wave of gen
eral protest swept the hall.
Busy Offices
All day, men affected by there- |
port filed into the offices of Balch i
and Mrs. Dorothy Loofbourow, di- \
rector of Toyon.
The ruling by Men's Housing ]
Committee was necessitated by the
administration's announcement that
approximately 1,000 freshmen have
been admitted to maintain the Stan
ford enrollment level at 7,500.
There are 6.1 non-eating club men
living in Toyon who intend to re
main in University dormitory space.
Ted Roelfsema, Housing Com
chairman, said volunteers from this j
group of independents will he asked ■
to move to Stern Hall. If there is [
not room left in Toyon for those |
who cannot afford to move to Stern,
they will be forced to moved.
George Engstrom, Toyon presi
dent and an eating club member,
realized the importance of placing
all freshmen in campus residences,
but he said he hoped an arrange
ment can be worked out more satis
factory to the independents.
Roelfsema clarified the number of
sophomores who can be admitted to
Stern next fall. He said they will j
get ten per cent of the vacancies in |
Stern after the Toyon "extras" have
moved. One hundred thirty vacan- |
cies are expected in Stern.
I>ess Than 1.000
Balch stated that 1,000 men are
not expected to show up in the fall.
All housing figures have been com
puted on the basis of 700 n°w fresh
men after an anticipated drop of !!0
per cent, among those who actually
are admitted. The greater the drop |
in the freshman class, the better
will tie the possibilities for Toyon I
independents remaining in the 23R j
Toyon spaces.
Of the 700 freshmen expected, j
Housing Com has estimated 50 wdl J
commute from homes in the imrne- I
diate area, 150 will live in Toyon, I
and 500 will occupy Encina.
Balch has sent out a large number j
of letters to prospective freshmen j
