# Draft Law Extended
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” A "draftless"
draft bill, providing a two-year ex
tension of the Selective Service Law
but barring inductions unless Con
gress gives the word, passed the
House late today and went to the
Senate.
II would extend selective serv
ice, on a stand-by basis, for two
years beyond the expiration date of
the present law, next June 24.
Youths attaining their 18th birth
days would be required to register
with their local draft boards, as at
present, but they could not be or
dered into uniform unless Congress
declared the existence of a national
emergency requiring expansion of
the armed forces.
