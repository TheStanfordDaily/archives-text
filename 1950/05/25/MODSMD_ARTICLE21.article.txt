# Sterling Gives Reasons Behind Tuition Increase
## Points Up Stanford's $800,000 Deficit This Year, Rising Educational Costs 
### 
In his first major address ol the year to the student body, Dr.
Wallace Sterling spoke last night on current educational issue.,
ranging from federal aid to education to the increase in Stanford's
tuition.
In regard to the tuition raise, Dr. Sterling said that Stanford ha .

been operating in the black, or
nearly so, but without allowing for
present needs. He contrasted this
with the findings of a newspaper
survey of 700 educational institu
tions, of which 20 per cent operated
deficit budgets during high tuition
income years.
He pointed to a deficit gap of
$800,000 out of the $8 to $B'/ 2 million
dollar budget submitted for the
University this year.
Against the $660 a student will
pay for his education next year, Dr.
Sterling quoted the cost of educai
ing that student as $1,164. Tuition
takes care of 53 per cent of the tot <i
cost, with gifts, trusts, and bequc t ,
to the University comprising the
rest.
Moving on to federal aid to edu
cation, Dr. Sterling said: "I myself
would take a close look at federal
aid to make sure that there were
no strings attached that would be
uncongenial to the winds of free
dom that blow here."
Admitting the danger of authori
tarian or cult control of learning, he
stressed an equal threat in the ab
sence of adequate federal aid. He
referred to the danger of a level of
illiteracy where the demagogue, (he
charlatan, and the quack operate
most effectively.
Quoting the recent government
outlay for education, he said, "W"
have federal aid. The question i
what we are going to do with it
in terms of degree and applica
tion."
Dr. Sterling spoke of private uni
versifies as the pace-setters in aca
demic performance and one of the
best guarantors of freedom.
The president discussed needed
improvements in Stanford's currif
ulum that would insure the stu
dent. his "dollar value" through
competent teaching and other
means. Adequate student advising,
nearer the Canadian tutorial .sys
tem, and a rapid return to the resi
dence university were the major
"other means" recommended
