# Graduates in Action
## 
### 
The formation of a graduate council last
week was a new step by graduates toward
integration in campus life. The council is an
intermediate step to a final form of govern
ment. Its purpose is to strengthen graduate
interest and lay the foundation for a council
that v/ould have the status of an ASSU board,
such as Cardinals, Hally Committee, or the De
hate Society.
The Council was formed by ASSU Excom
members Hank Grandin and Hex Johnson, and
developed after the Excom general budget ses
sion more than two months ago when Grandin
and Johnson asked for more graduate partici
pation in student funds.
Excom asked at that time that discussion of
graduate finances be deferred unttl the gradu
ates were able to show concrete interest in par
ticipating in student affairs.
Grandin describes the present council as a
club which is a sounding board lor ideas. The
graduates are already thinking about a gradu
ate section in the proposed Union, special gym
classes, and better ticket privileges for wives
at football games.
We like the idea of an active graduate group
in campus government. So far, organization

has been the work of a minority ol the students,
but a general meeting ol graduates is planned
next fall to present the program to the whole
graduate student body.
There is one feature of the proposed organ
ization that seems undesirable for the structure
of student government. That is the creation of
a graduate council as a permanent ASSU board
with a budget of student body funds of its own,
like Rally Committee and Cardinals.
Graduate students should organize their gov
ernment similar to the class governments, with
their own executive government and their own
sources of money.
The ASSU budget, under present circum
stances, can stand no large additional outlays.
Next year, the new budget is going to be even
harder to draw up because of the decline in
income as student registration declines and
student activities remain at the same high level.
The graduate students represent a class.
Therefore, they should plan to operate as a
class, and not burden the ASSU. Their ideas
are sound, and their purposes worthy, but they
should attempt to take their place in student
government without a subsidy from the student
body as a whole.—A.M.
