rant ion to 'Monsters'
To the Editor:
Like everyone else who read it, I enjoyed the imagi
native wit of A. Henry's account of the Monster up—
and down—the Hoover Tower. Real humor is treasur
able. But 1 deeply hope that Monster has gone down,
and under (to Cal, of course) for keeps. He might have
grim food here, someday.
Good mountaineers, who don't go in for spectacular
: tunts, know that no skill is proof against a rope
accident. and tragedy, which will affect the climber,
his companions, his family. A useful University build
ing is not a mountain. Tragedy here will mean re
current hoi or and grief to everyone who uses--who
even sees this building. The man who founded it

as a contribution to the building of pekce began to
sprve his fellow man in this school and has never
stopped. He does not deserve to have the building
scarred forever with human destruction.
Granted that for skilled climbers, as these foot
step stuntcrs must be, the adventure must strike them
just as fun and daring. But inspite of all the safe
guards the University and student government can
put up against the used of tragedy, the chances are
that this Monster-stuff can tempt some less-skilled—
and less lucky—exhibitionists to try it again,—in a
hurry, in the dark. It won't seem like fun—it will be
an unbearable memory of their Stanford days—to any
students who have Leen responsible, by suggestion,
for the crippling or the paralysis 01 the deaths of
other, lafer Stanford students.
