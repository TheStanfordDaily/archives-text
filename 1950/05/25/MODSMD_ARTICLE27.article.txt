### CORNELIA LITTLE 
A University of Georgia reporter has discovered to
his gieat amusement that more than 100 students mis
pelled their religion when they filled in their church
preference on the college application blanks. The re
porter was particularly beguiled by "Prodrostront"
and "Prepertian." Several dozen student claimed they
were "Babtists." And, t>f course, there was the man
who was an "Agnostist." But we wonder about the
literacy of the reporter himself, or at least of some
ropyreader. Listed among the misspellings was "Bap
tist," just like that. And furthermore, in the article
• •veil "misspelled" was misspelled. '1 liey put only one
s in it.

In a recent University of Washington Daily is an
account of what can happen to a professor when he
advocates the principles of the Declaration of Inde
pendence. It started when UW Professor Max Sa
vt He made a speech, which was reported in the Daily
under the headline, "Right to Overthrow Government
Okayed." Savelle wrote a and painstaking letter
to the Daily explaining his position—"l said , I thought
very carefully, that the doctrine of the right to over*
throw a tyrannical government by violence, as a last
i• ort and by the 'general will,' is embedded in the
An;;lo-Saxori constitutional tradition." A letter to the

editor accused the Daily of "editorializing by innu
endo" in its report of the .speech.
The Daily printed the Savelle letter but maintained
stubbornly that their report was "not incompetent."
They discouraged any further protest by saying that
they don't intend to enter a "trivial match of quib
bling over 'You did,' and 'I didn't'."
Atid, as we said, his main crime was agreeing with
the Declaration of Independence.

Pomona's newspaper, Student Life, often sports a
self-abusive motto at the top of page one. Like "none
of the news part of the time," "all of the news none
of the time," "part of the news—" you get the idea.
And just for variety one issue, the staff dubbed their
paper "The nose and throat of the world." Obvious
conclusion: they're either too honest or too cliche
conscious to use anything as trite (or as Pathe?) as
"Eyes and ears."

The Cal Poly newspaper points out something that
might not have occurred to you. Just to make every
one as unhappy with Daylight Saving Time as pos
sible, they brought out this startling and indisputable
fact under DST, an eight o'clock class is really a
seven o'clock.
Better ignore it, though. It's too depressing.

Okayed." Savelle wrote a and painstaking letter
to the Daily explaining his position—"l said , I thought
very carefully, that the doctrine of the right to over*
throw a tyrannical government by violence, as a last

An;;lo-Saxori constitutional tradition." A letter to the

editor accused the Daily of "editorializing by innu

The Daily printed the Savelle letter but maintained
stubbornly that their report was "not incompetent."
They discouraged any further protest by saying that
they don't intend to enter a "trivial match of quib
bling over 'You did,' and 'I didn't'."
Atid, as we said, his main crime was agreeing with
the Declaration of Independence.

Pomona's newspaper, Student Life, often sports a
self-abusive motto at the top of page one. Like "none
of the news part of the time," "all of the news none
of the time," "part of the news—" you get the idea.
And just for variety one issue, the staff dubbed their
paper "The nose and throat of the world." Obvious
conclusion: they're either too honest or too cliche
conscious to use anything as trite (or as Pathe?) as
"Eyes and ears."

The Cal Poly newspaper points out something that
might not have occurred to you. Just to make every
one as unhappy with Daylight Saving Time as pos
sible, they brought out this startling and indisputable
fact under DST, an eight o'clock class is really a
seven o'clock.
Better ignore it, though. It's too depressing.
A University of Georgia reporter has discovered to
his gieat amusement that more than 100 students mis
pelled their religion when they filled in their church
preference on the college application blanks. The re
porter was particularly beguiled by "Prodrostront"
and "Prepertian." Several dozen student claimed they
were "Babtists." And, t>f course, there was the man
who was an "Agnostist." But we wonder about the
literacy of the reporter himself, or at least of some
ropyreader. Listed among the misspellings was "Bap
tist," just like that. And furthermore, in the article
• •veil "misspelled" was misspelled. '1 liey put only one
s in it.

In a recent University of Washington Daily is an
account of what can happen to a professor when he
advocates the principles of the Declaration of Inde
pendence. It started when UW Professor Max Sa
vt He made a speech, which was reported in the Daily
under the headline, "Right to Overthrow Government
Okayed." Savelle wrote a and painstaking letter
to the Daily explaining his position—"l said , I thought
very carefully, that the doctrine of the right to over*
throw a tyrannical government by violence, as a last
