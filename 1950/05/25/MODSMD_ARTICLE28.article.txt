# Flyers Lose Charter By Excom Vote
## 
### 
Excom voted Tuesday night to re
voke the charter of the Stanford
Flying Club unless full insurance
coverage is taken out by the clulj
in the name of the ASSU.
The action was teased upon a legal
opinion from the Law School that
the ASSU would be liable for any
damages incurred by the club, in
stead of the individual members
themselves being responsible.
The Excom ruling also prohibits
the club from using a name asso
ciating it with Stanford.
Al Bletz, representing the organi
zation, told the student representa
tives that the club had been active
under the name of Cardinal Flyers
for the past two months and had
taken in non-Stanford members so
that it could not legally be consid
ered a Stanford organization.
