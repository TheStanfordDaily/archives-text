# Mighty Troy Once Again Rates Role of Favorite in PCC Track
## 
### JOHN BREIER 
Stanford's none-top-bVight : pros
pects in Saturday's PCC champion
ship track meet took a turn for the
worse and then brightened up again
yesterday when it was announced
that Gay Bryan would be out of the
meet because of an abscess condi
tion that needed an operation.
Later in the afternoon Bryan was

1 declared fit for competition after
! doctors had decided to wait upon
' the operation.
Even with the limited services of
the star broad jumper, dash man,
and what have you, the Cards must
rank second to the heavily favored
Trojans.
A healthy Bryan scored only five
points last year with a fifth in the
! 100 and a second in the broad jump.
This year's century will see such
stars as Cal's Donnie Anderson and
Oregon's Bill Fell, both 9.5 men,
competing with Bryan. The Gay
one ran a 9.6 behind Donnie An
derson and could come in third here
if in good condition, which he is
not.
Oregon's Dave Henthorne ranks
fourth in the Conference with 9.7.
| Stanford's Ronnie Buck, WSC's
: Craig Weisman, and Cal's Roland
Maples have 9.B's. USC will try
| with 9.9 men A 1 Mejia and John
i Bradley.
The combination here should cut

down on USC points, but at the
same time may well see Stanford
out of the money also.
The 220 has much the same cast
with Stanford's Wilbur Taylor cred
ited with third-place mark of 21.4
behind Anderson's 20.8 and Weis
man's 21.0. USC will come back
with Bradley (21.5), George Pas
quali (21.6), and Mejia (21.7). If
either or both Bob and Gay Bryan
could come through, USC could find
itself down in the low-point class.
But again, Stanford could do the
same behind the fast-running An
derson, Weisman, Maples, and Fell.
Another northerner who could
help the Card cause no little is pole
vaulter George Rasmussen of Ore
gon. This lad has hit 14-1 this year
(14-4 best). He can be counted to
divide honors with the usual sure
one-two USC combination of Walt
Jensen (14-4) and Jack Rowan who
cleared 14 for the first time last
week.
Stanford's Don Campbell (13-10)
could be in for points as\ could
OSC's Lyle Dickey, Oregon's Don
Pickens, both at 13-G. This should
be the closie and probably the last
result to come in. It may well de
cide the meet â€”if USC hasn't wiped
up the field in the 880, mile, and
two-mile.
