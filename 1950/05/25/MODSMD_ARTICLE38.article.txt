# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry

### 
Bill I .eiser, Dink '1 cmpleton. and several other very learned and re
spected gentlemen of the press have gone on record praising the University
of Southern California for their fine gesture in withdrawing from the PCC
horsehide playoffs so that Stanford could meet WSC this weekend to deter
mine the West Coa'l representative to the NC2A playoffs in Omaha. Mr.
Leiser even went so far as to say that "no such move by USC was needed
to prove the men down there are gentlemen. We knew it all along."
I would, at this time, like to go on record as agreeing most whole-heartedly
with these gentlmen in their praise of the Trojans' beau gests. And I would
certainly not publicly question the gentlemanly instincts of such fine and
splendid men as Sam Barry and Willis Hunter. In this moment of supreme
gratitude to ol' SC, I wouldn't even question the chivalrous tendencies of
.Jess Hill or Jeff Cravath. They are all honorable men.
But purely in defense of USC—in case someone might think the Trol
ley-traekers are slipping or getting soft—l would like to point out that
the Tro'an move could have had other than the most pure, altruistic
reasons behind it.
First of all, there was the Trojan nine itself who, contrary to Mr. Leiser's
statement, did not look ns though they "liked to play the game as much as
any men in baseball" la I Saturday, when tl «»y blew their finale to Cal,
G to 5. The Trojans allowed six unearned runs, which is about that the
Golden Bears could muster that afternoon. This and the reported attitude
of the Trojans after the contest seem to indicate that Sam Barry had a bit
of a morale problem on his team. A morale problem that would make a
trip to Pullman a rather useless and disagreeable task.
Secondly was the wave of public opinion that thundered against the Bo
vard Field gates when it was announced that third-place Troy would
meet the Cougars rather than the CIBA champions, Stanford. Will Con
nolly of the SF Citron used the word "stinks" in connection with the
choice. Other papers, in other language, echoed his sentiments.
True, by the rules as they stood, USC was the PCC So. Div. champ.
Nobody argued USC's i i:»ht, only the wisdom of the ruling.
But the big difference between this rule and the rule that Mr. A. A. Stags
violated to give the Trojans the Fresno Relays was that everyone knew of
the track disqualification rule (except maybe Mr. Stags), while no one seems
to have known about the baseball ruling until after Stanford had met her
last PCC opponent. In short, while the Trojan spikemen went into the
Fresno affait well aware of the rules they were competing under, neither
the Trojans, Bruins, Indians, or Bears (coaches or players) knew that the
PCC joker was in the deck.
Sjim Barry didn't know. As the worthy USC mentor told me over the
phone last Sunday, ''We all thought that the winner of the CIBA would
automatically represent the Southern Division in the PCC playoffs." Everett
Dean, likewise, was uninformed of the ruling.
Al Masters and Willis Hunter, the interested athletic directors, should
have known, since they helped to vote in the rule. But if they remem
bered (which they didn't) they didn't tell anybody about it.
So to the eyes of the great and goodly public—of which even SC must
occasionally take notice Stanford was getting the blocks shoved to her, and
USC was the baby to snap at. The great and goodly public was wrong, and
USC was, this time, as much a victim of circumstances as Stanford. But
the people on the outside didn't know or didn't care about that.
And in the third place—the most important place, I think—if USC
had gone into the PCC playoffs against the Cougars, it would have meant
the end (kaput, finis) of the CIBA.
The California Intercollegiate Baseball Association is a good league—
probably the best in the nation. It has good players, good coaches, and the
weather allows for a long time to practice. It is also Sam Barry's baby.
Barry was one of the mainsprings in the founding of the league.
And by mere coincidence, the only way the schedules can function in the
CIBA is for each of the four Northern California schools to play USC (and
UCLA) twice in Los Angeles for every one game the Southlanders play
up here. Thus, Stanford plays one game with USC on the Farm and two
with the Trojans in Los Angeles, as does Cal, Santa Clara, and St. Mary's.
There are twice as many schools up here, so the thing works out the only
way it can in the CIBA setup.
But if you put this schedule under the PCC ruling, the Indians and the
Golden Bears really have a raw deal. Thus, if the PCC ruling was to stand,
the CIBA had to go, and a more equitable scheduling would have to be
arranged.
Then, of coursc, there was the opinion of the other coaches in the CIBA
to be contended with. They all went on record saying that they thought
that Stanford was the better team. I think that Sam Barry would agree.
So. in making (he noble gesture, USC was certainly displaying sports
manship—there is no denying that. But they were also balancing the
ledger with the idea, "What will get us the most?" Would they gain
more by taking a morale-shaky third-place ball club to Pullman? Or
would they gain more by bowing out and receiving the good press and
fine publicity, and the salvation of the Trojan advantages in the CIBA?
Now this column is certainly not a blast at USC. Never. Never. Never.
I used to root for them when I was in junior high school. I was rooting for
them when Michigan eked out, 49 to 0. in the 1948 Rose Bowl. They are
fine competitors. Overall they have the best teams on the Coast.
They have made a fine and gallant gesture, but I just wanted to point
out that they were not getting soft. This is just another Trojan victory—
and one which may mean more to thein than a scoreboard win. It is good
sportsmanship, but in a world that is getting a bit tired of the Trojans
eking out disputed decisions, it is also good sense. And nobody ever
accused the Trojans of lack of good sense.

True, by the rules as they stood, USC was the PCC So. Div. champ.
Nobody argued USC's i i:»ht, only the wisdom of the ruling.
But the big difference between this rule and the rule that Mr. A. A. Stags
violated to give the Trojans the Fresno Relays was that everyone knew of
the track disqualification rule (except maybe Mr. Stags), while no one seems
to have known about the baseball ruling until after Stanford had met her
last PCC opponent. In short, while the Trojan spikemen went into the
Fresno affait well aware of the rules they were competing under, neither
the Trojans, Bruins, Indians, or Bears (coaches or players) knew that the
PCC joker was in the deck.
Sjim Barry didn't know. As the worthy USC mentor told me over the
phone last Sunday, ''We all thought that the winner of the CIBA would
automatically represent the Southern Division in the PCC playoffs." Everett
Dean, likewise, was uninformed of the ruling.
Al Masters and Willis Hunter, the interested athletic directors, should
have known, since they helped to vote in the rule. But if they remem
bered (which they didn't) they didn't tell anybody about it.
So to the eyes of the great and goodly public—of which even SC must
occasionally take notice Stanford was getting the blocks shoved to her, and
USC was the baby to snap at. The great and goodly public was wrong, and
USC was, this time, as much a victim of circumstances as Stanford. But
the people on the outside didn't know or didn't care about that.
And in the third place—the most important place, I think—if USC
had gone into the PCC playoffs against the Cougars, it would have meant
the end (kaput, finis) of the CIBA.
The California Intercollegiate Baseball Association is a good league—
probably the best in the nation. It has good players, good coaches, and the
weather allows for a long time to practice. It is also Sam Barry's baby.
Barry was one of the mainsprings in the founding of the league.
And by mere coincidence, the only way the schedules can function in the
CIBA is for each of the four Northern California schools to play USC (and
UCLA) twice in Los Angeles for every one game the Southlanders play
up here. Thus, Stanford plays one game with USC on the Farm and two
with the Trojans in Los Angeles, as does Cal, Santa Clara, and St. Mary's.
There are twice as many schools up here, so the thing works out the only
way it can in the CIBA setup.
But if you put this schedule under the PCC ruling, the Indians and the
Golden Bears really have a raw deal. Thus, if the PCC ruling was to stand,
the CIBA had to go, and a more equitable scheduling would have to be
arranged.
Then, of coursc, there was the opinion of the other coaches in the CIBA
to be contended with. They all went on record saying that they thought
that Stanford was the better team. I think that Sam Barry would agree.
So. in making (he noble gesture, USC was certainly displaying sports
manship—there is no denying that. But they were also balancing the
ledger with the idea, "What will get us the most?" Would they gain
more by taking a morale-shaky third-place ball club to Pullman? Or
would they gain more by bowing out and receiving the good press and
fine publicity, and the salvation of the Trojan advantages in the CIBA?
Now this column is certainly not a blast at USC. Never. Never. Never.
I used to root for them when I was in junior high school. I was rooting for
them when Michigan eked out, 49 to 0. in the 1948 Rose Bowl. They are
fine competitors. Overall they have the best teams on the Coast.
They have made a fine and gallant gesture, but I just wanted to point
out that they were not getting soft. This is just another Trojan victory—
and one which may mean more to thein than a scoreboard win. It is good
sportsmanship, but in a world that is getting a bit tired of the Trojans
eking out disputed decisions, it is also good sense. And nobody ever
accused the Trojans of lack of good sense.

Bill I .eiser, Dink '1 cmpleton. and several other very learned and re
spected gentlemen of the press have gone on record praising the University
of Southern California for their fine gesture in withdrawing from the PCC
horsehide playoffs so that Stanford could meet WSC this weekend to deter
mine the West Coa'l representative to the NC2A playoffs in Omaha. Mr.
Leiser even went so far as to say that "no such move by USC was needed
to prove the men down there are gentlemen. We knew it all along."
I would, at this time, like to go on record as agreeing most whole-heartedly
with these gentlmen in their praise of the Trojans' beau gests. And I would
certainly not publicly question the gentlemanly instincts of such fine and
splendid men as Sam Barry and Willis Hunter. In this moment of supreme
gratitude to ol' SC, I wouldn't even question the chivalrous tendencies of
.Jess Hill or Jeff Cravath. They are all honorable men.
But purely in defense of USC—in case someone might think the Trol
ley-traekers are slipping or getting soft—l would like to point out that
the Tro'an move could have had other than the most pure, altruistic
reasons behind it.
First of all, there was the Trojan nine itself who, contrary to Mr. Leiser's
statement, did not look ns though they "liked to play the game as much as
any men in baseball" la I Saturday, when tl «»y blew their finale to Cal,
G to 5. The Trojans allowed six unearned runs, which is about that the
Golden Bears could muster that afternoon. This and the reported attitude
of the Trojans after the contest seem to indicate that Sam Barry had a bit
of a morale problem on his team. A morale problem that would make a
trip to Pullman a rather useless and disagreeable task.
Secondly was the wave of public opinion that thundered against the Bo
vard Field gates when it was announced that third-place Troy would
meet the Cougars rather than the CIBA champions, Stanford. Will Con
nolly of the SF Citron used the word "stinks" in connection with the
choice. Other papers, in other language, echoed his sentiments.

CIBA is for each of the four Northern California schools to play USC (and
UCLA) twice in Los Angeles for every one game the Southlanders play
up here. Thus, Stanford plays one game with USC on the Farm and two
with the Trojans in Los Angeles, as does Cal, Santa Clara, and St. Mary's.
There are twice as many schools up here, so the thing works out the only
way it can in the CIBA setup.
But if you put this schedule under the PCC ruling, the Indians and the
Golden Bears really have a raw deal. Thus, if the PCC ruling was to stand,
the CIBA had to go, and a more equitable scheduling would have to be
arranged.
Then, of coursc, there was the opinion of the other coaches in the CIBA
to be contended with. They all went on record saying that they thought
that Stanford was the better team. I think that Sam Barry would agree.
So. in making (he noble gesture, USC was certainly displaying sports
manship—there is no denying that. But they were also balancing the
ledger with the idea, "What will get us the most?" Would they gain
more by taking a morale-shaky third-place ball club to Pullman? Or
would they gain more by bowing out and receiving the good press and
fine publicity, and the salvation of the Trojan advantages in the CIBA?
Now this column is certainly not a blast at USC. Never. Never. Never.
I used to root for them when I was in junior high school. I was rooting for
them when Michigan eked out, 49 to 0. in the 1948 Rose Bowl. They are
fine competitors. Overall they have the best teams on the Coast.
They have made a fine and gallant gesture, but I just wanted to point
out that they were not getting soft. This is just another Trojan victory—
and one which may mean more to thein than a scoreboard win. It is good
sportsmanship, but in a world that is getting a bit tired of the Trojans
eking out disputed decisions, it is also good sense. And nobody ever
accused the Trojans of lack of good sense.

Bill I .eiser, Dink '1 cmpleton. and several other very learned and re
spected gentlemen of the press have gone on record praising the University
of Southern California for their fine gesture in withdrawing from the PCC
horsehide playoffs so that Stanford could meet WSC this weekend to deter
mine the West Coa'l representative to the NC2A playoffs in Omaha. Mr.
Leiser even went so far as to say that "no such move by USC was needed
to prove the men down there are gentlemen. We knew it all along."
I would, at this time, like to go on record as agreeing most whole-heartedly
with these gentlmen in their praise of the Trojans' beau gests. And I would
certainly not publicly question the gentlemanly instincts of such fine and
splendid men as Sam Barry and Willis Hunter. In this moment of supreme
gratitude to ol' SC, I wouldn't even question the chivalrous tendencies of
.Jess Hill or Jeff Cravath. They are all honorable men.
But purely in defense of USC—in case someone might think the Trol
ley-traekers are slipping or getting soft—l would like to point out that
the Tro'an move could have had other than the most pure, altruistic
reasons behind it.
First of all, there was the Trojan nine itself who, contrary to Mr. Leiser's
statement, did not look ns though they "liked to play the game as much as
any men in baseball" la I Saturday, when tl «»y blew their finale to Cal,
G to 5. The Trojans allowed six unearned runs, which is about that the
Golden Bears could muster that afternoon. This and the reported attitude
of the Trojans after the contest seem to indicate that Sam Barry had a bit
of a morale problem on his team. A morale problem that would make a
trip to Pullman a rather useless and disagreeable task.
Secondly was the wave of public opinion that thundered against the Bo
vard Field gates when it was announced that third-place Troy would
meet the Cougars rather than the CIBA champions, Stanford. Will Con
nolly of the SF Citron used the word "stinks" in connection with the
choice. Other papers, in other language, echoed his sentiments.
True, by the rules as they stood, USC was the PCC So. Div. champ.
Nobody argued USC's i i:»ht, only the wisdom of the ruling.
But the big difference between this rule and the rule that Mr. A. A. Stags
violated to give the Trojans the Fresno Relays was that everyone knew of
the track disqualification rule (except maybe Mr. Stags), while no one seems
to have known about the baseball ruling until after Stanford had met her
last PCC opponent. In short, while the Trojan spikemen went into the
Fresno affait well aware of the rules they were competing under, neither
the Trojans, Bruins, Indians, or Bears (coaches or players) knew that the
PCC joker was in the deck.
Sjim Barry didn't know. As the worthy USC mentor told me over the
phone last Sunday, ''We all thought that the winner of the CIBA would
automatically represent the Southern Division in the PCC playoffs." Everett
Dean, likewise, was uninformed of the ruling.
Al Masters and Willis Hunter, the interested athletic directors, should
have known, since they helped to vote in the rule. But if they remem
bered (which they didn't) they didn't tell anybody about it.
So to the eyes of the great and goodly public—of which even SC must
occasionally take notice Stanford was getting the blocks shoved to her, and
USC was the baby to snap at. The great and goodly public was wrong, and
USC was, this time, as much a victim of circumstances as Stanford. But
the people on the outside didn't know or didn't care about that.
And in the third place—the most important place, I think—if USC
had gone into the PCC playoffs against the Cougars, it would have meant
the end (kaput, finis) of the CIBA.
The California Intercollegiate Baseball Association is a good league—
probably the best in the nation. It has good players, good coaches, and the
weather allows for a long time to practice. It is also Sam Barry's baby.
