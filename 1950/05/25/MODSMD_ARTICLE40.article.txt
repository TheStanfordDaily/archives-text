# Card Horsehiders Leave For WSC Series Today
## 
### 
Everett Dean will pack 18 players
and his CIBA pennant aboard a
chartered DC-3 Skymaster this
morning at 10, as the Cards start
north for a three-game playoff with
Washington State and their first
chance for an NCAA championship
in Stanford's baseball history.
Action starts tomorrow afternoon,
with games also scheduled for Sat
urday, and another Monday if the
clubs have to stretch things out.
The Indian squad list includes six
pitchers, two catchers, live infield—
ers, five outfielders, one manager,
and two coaches.
Opening day hurling assignments
will undoubtedly go to two sopho
mores, Joe Che/, the class of the
CIBA with 7 and 0, and Gene Con
ley, WSC's six-foot nine-inch fire
baller.
It will be Washington State's
fourth straight attempt to get by
CIBA competition after winning a
Northern Division title. So far the
Cougars have failed on all counts,
losing to California in 1947 and to
USC in '48 and '49.
Stanford, still a bit embarrassed
! over Tuesday's 8 to (i loss to USF's
Dons, will attempt to crack Conley's
strong right-handed slants with a
barrage of four different men who
are clipping the ball at .'5OO or bet
ter.
Dave Melton, a repeat choice on
the Examiner's all - league nine,
leads Stanford's team batting at
..'i!i9. followed by Dick Clegg (. S.'i.'l),
Charles Cole (.31G), and cluteher

Tom Shaw (.302). Charlie Cole and
Joe Chez, besides Melton, were also
choices on the Hearst all-star squad
for 1950.

PITCHERS — Joe Chez, Jack
Ifc inert, Dave StoM, Jim Clay pool,
Tony Stellar, and Roger Osen
haugh.
