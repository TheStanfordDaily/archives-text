# NSA Will Attend Prague Congress
## 
### 
A 12-man commission from the
NSA will represent the views of
over 800,000 American students
when the World Student Congress
convenes in Prague, August 14-28.
The Congress will be sponsored
by the Communist-dominated In
ternational Union of Students. Over
500 delegates representing four mil
lion students of the world plan to
attend.
NSA's decision to send a full ob
server-delegation to speak for stu
dents in the United States came in
protest to the previous meetings of
the IUS. American students gave
distorted views of American cam
puses and life, NSA observers re
ported.
At the 1949 NSA Congress in Illi
nois, the lUS was branded unrepre
sentative of students on an inter
national basis.
Applications for positions on the
NSA delegation should be made to
NSA. International Office, 9(1 Win
throp Street, Cambridge, Mass, by
May 29. Conversational ability in a
foreign language is required.
