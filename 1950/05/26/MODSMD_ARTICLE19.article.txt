## Panel Group Names Union Logical Choice 
### 
The most logical alternative to
avoirl war in the present world situ
ation is by the formation of a fed
eral union of the North Atlantic De
mocracies.
This was the conclusion reached
last night by a panel discussion of
three Stanford professors and some
40 interested listeners in the social
room of the Education Building.
Participating in the panel discus
sion were Professors Karl Brandt,
Eliot Blackwelder, and Gordon F.
Ferris. Dr. Ira L. Wiggins acted as
the moderator for the panel and also
for the open discussion following the
talks.
Among the interesting sidelights of
the evening was the evidence of
fered in the open discussion by two
foreign students who attended the
meeting. They presented the outlook
of Europeans and the people of Rus
sia toward union of the North At
lantic countries.
Dr. Wiggins opened the night's
program pointing out that in history
there have been continually a "num
ber of situations which have de
teriorated into war, and there is a
need for war to be outlawed not only
in the hearts and minds of men, but
legally."
The purpose is then, continued the
moderator, to form an Atlantic Union
Committee to block the tendency to
ward aggression and see that the de
mocracies having freedom of the in
dividual are preserved.
The olan for establishing the At
lantic federation was offered by Dr.
Blackwelder. It consists of four
points, the first being the ratification
of the U.S. Congress of a resolution
suggesting the calling of a federal
constitutional convention as soon as
possible.
The next points concern the draw
ing up of a constitution, the ratifica
tion of that constitution by the na
tions involved, and finally the estab
lishment of h larger federal union.
In the words of Dr. Brandt, "We
have never left the state of war, and
we must restore the balance of
power by associating with nations
while not abandoning our political
principles.
"If we can establish a federation
already allied to," he continued, "we
will reduce the burden of military
expense and make military defense
more effective."
The art of politics consists of doing
what is possible, said Professor Fer
ris. Consequently we must reject the
idealistic plans for world govern
ment and stop "butting our heads
against the wall." Russia's position
is clear, anrr the only way to pos
sibly meet Russia's threat is to have
the North Atlantic Nations bound to
defend each other."
The discussion group was spon
sored by the newly formed Stanford
Chapter of Atlantic Union Commit
tee. They favor the plan presented
by Clarence Streit, author of "Union
Now."

room of the Education Building.
Participating in the panel discus
sion were Professors Karl Brandt,
Eliot Blackwelder, and Gordon F.
Ferris. Dr. Ira L. Wiggins acted as
the moderator for the panel and also
for the open discussion following the
talks.
Among the interesting sidelights of
the evening was the evidence of
fered in the open discussion by two
foreign students who attended the
meeting. They presented the outlook
of Europeans and the people of Rus
sia toward union of the North At
lantic countries.
Dr. Wiggins opened the night's
program pointing out that in history
there have been continually a "num
ber of situations which have de
teriorated into war, and there is a
need for war to be outlawed not only
in the hearts and minds of men, but
legally."
The purpose is then, continued the
moderator, to form an Atlantic Union
Committee to block the tendency to
ward aggression and see that the de
mocracies having freedom of the in
dividual are preserved.
The olan for establishing the At
lantic federation was offered by Dr.
Blackwelder. It consists of four
points, the first being the ratification
of the U.S. Congress of a resolution
suggesting the calling of a federal
constitutional convention as soon as
possible.
The next points concern the draw
ing up of a constitution, the ratifica
tion of that constitution by the na
tions involved, and finally the estab
lishment of h larger federal union.
In the words of Dr. Brandt, "We
have never left the state of war, and
we must restore the balance of
power by associating with nations
while not abandoning our political
principles.
"If we can establish a federation
already allied to," he continued, "we
will reduce the burden of military
expense and make military defense
more effective."
The art of politics consists of doing
what is possible, said Professor Fer
ris. Consequently we must reject the
idealistic plans for world govern
ment and stop "butting our heads
against the wall." Russia's position
is clear, anrr the only way to pos
sibly meet Russia's threat is to have
the North Atlantic Nations bound to
defend each other."
The discussion group was spon
sored by the newly formed Stanford
Chapter of Atlantic Union Commit
tee. They favor the plan presented
by Clarence Streit, author of "Union
Now."
The most logical alternative to
avoirl war in the present world situ
ation is by the formation of a fed
eral union of the North Atlantic De
mocracies.
This was the conclusion reached
last night by a panel discussion of
three Stanford professors and some
40 interested listeners in the social
room of the Education Building.
