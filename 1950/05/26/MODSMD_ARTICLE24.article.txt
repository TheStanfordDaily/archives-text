11l the first of a projected series
of senior seminars held last night,
electrical engineering students em
phasized the need for an improved
orientation and counseling program
for incoming "double E" students.
The discussions, designed to give
the faculty a student view of the
school program, emphasized the
need for an orientation and coun
seling program that would allow the
student to follow a more direct
course toward his degree.
It was suggested that, in view of
the large number of students forced
on the faculty counselors,, some sys
tem of senior student counseling of
the new students could be effected
to supplement the regular program.
Moderator Hal Mason stressed
that student opinion of teaching
methods and course content was ex
tremely high.
"Most students," said Mason,
"seem to feel that they get what
they're here for."
"However, with the .so-called
'fringe' courses taken by EE stu
dents in conjunction with their ma
jor, there is ;i feeling that there is
not enough slant toward the engi
neering student,'' Mason said.
