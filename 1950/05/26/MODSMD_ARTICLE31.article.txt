# New Athletic By-laws to Go Before Excom
## 
### 
Excom will review an improved
set of athletic by-laws next Wed
nesday. The executive committee
reviewed the finished draft of the
by-laws for the athletic committ :<â€¢
Tuesday night, but was unable to
pass on them because of the lack of
a quorum.
Junior varsity football and bas
ketball are given new recognition
under the new laws in a provision
providing for awards similar to the
Block and Circle "S." Members of
these two sports will be given foui
inch Block ''SV with the word
"Braves" superimposed. Only th<-
letter will be awarded, and no sec
ond-year letters will be given.
Major Sports Defined
According to the by-laws, a team
may have major sport status when
it has complete recognition from tho
Athletic Department on coach, fi
nances, schedule, and conference
participation. The general criteria
for a major sport requires that the
sport be judged by "the degree of
student interest, national and local
prestige which it has attained, and
by the emphasis placed on the sport
by and at Stanford."
Any sport having official recog
nition from the Athletic Department,
as representing Stanford in compe
tition and which is not a major
sport shall be considered a minor
sport.
Sports awards were reclassified
under the new by-laws to avoid
confusion. Some changes were made
at the request of coaches and play -
ers.
Change in Sports Awards
The changes reflected the general
feeling of the coaches that empha
sis on a contest with any one school,
such as California or USC, should
be done away with because of the
possibi'ity of ups and down:, m
that specific school's athlete sue
cesses during any one year.
The athletes present at the Excom
meeting last Tuesday night ob
jected to some of these changes on
the grounds that awards baL.ed on
points made against certain school
increased the incentive of the ath
lete to do his best.
An example of the award change
was in baseball, where the require
ment. pertaining to participation in
the Cal or USC games was dropped.
Excom members anticipate fur
ther discussion on some of the new
requirements before the proposals
are voted on.
