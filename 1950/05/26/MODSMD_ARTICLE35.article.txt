To the Editor:
'Ihe Stanford Chapter of the Nat ional Association
for the Advancement of Colored People would like to
point out some mistakes and omissions in the letter
Mr. Donald E. Close wrote to The Daily lust Monday.
'l!ii letter dealt with why Mr. Close thought Howard
University taught its students that white people de
fended from Negroes.
On Wednesday a letter appeared in The Daily from
112 J'. King, in which pertinent facts about Mr. Close's
•ource of information were revealed. Wt- would like
to confirm Mr. King's statement that the speech from
tin- Congressional Record Mr. Close quotes was made
I y the late Senator Bilbo of Mississippi Also that re
marks Mr. Bilbo attributes to William Lee Hansberry,
a: -istent professor of history at Howard, were made
Lvtore the Washington Institute of Kate Relations.
/ I' o that Mr. Bilbo did not give the source of his resu
me ol these remarks by Professor Hansberry. Also
lliat remarks quoted by Mr. Bilbo have been taken out

ot the context of Professor Hansberry's talk.
But the statement of most concern to us in Mr.
Close's letter was that Howard is run exclusively for
Negroes, and hence the government should not sup
port it. We quote from Howard's bulletin of Informa
tion:
"It (Howard) has always been open to all races and
both sexes."
We can see no reason why the government shouldn't
run a university in Washington, D.C., which is a dis
trict rather than a state, and so could not expect to
come under the education system of any state govern
ment. Indeed, perhaps one reason Howard has such a
high Negro population is because Howard offers better
facilities than those offered by Southern state gov
ernments.
We trust that il Mr. Close has been laboring under
any misunderstandings about racial requirements ;il
Howard University, this letter will clear them up.
