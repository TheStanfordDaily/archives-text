Probably one of the men best
versed in knowledge of modern Rus
sia is Stanford's Merrill Spalding of
the History Department.
Beginning in 1922, when he worked
in Russia on famine relief, he has
studied that country in detail and
even met Leon Trotsky in conjunc
tion with his work for the Hoover
War Library on the Russian revo
lution.
After attending Harvard arid play
ing football there, Spalding received
a fellowship to study in Europe.
While at the University of Paris, he
became interested in the Russian
Revolution and the subsequent fam
ine and so asked to join the Hoover
Relief Project. In the summer of
1922, therefore he was sent to Russia
to help administer the famine relief.
Surplus Food
"It was very difficult to fight the
Soviet propaganda," he said. The
Communists said that America was
sending over food to help the Ameri
can farmers because of an alleged
over-production of food.
He also found it quite a problem
to keep the Communists from gain
ing control of some of the food.
Spalding found it difficult to get food
to some nuns in a convent, for in
stance. The Communists said the
nuns were parasites and that only
productive workers ought to be fed.
He went to Europe again in 1930,
and spent several months in Russia
at the time the first Five Year Plan
was being speeded up. Since it was
becoming dangerous to associate with
foreigners, Spalding found it bard to
get acquainted with the Russian peo
ple. Even so, the people were al
lowed to criticize. However, they
were only allowed to criticize how
orders were carried out, but not what
was carried out.
Meets Trotsky
In 1938 he went to Mexico to se
cure material on Russia from Leon
Trotsky. When he told Trotsky about
the work the Hoover Library was
doing in studying revolutions, the
Russian was eager to come and help.
However, Trotsky's plan to visit
the United States was never carried
out, "probably to the relief of the
Palo Alto police and the Stanford ad
ministration," Spalding said.
"The thought of assassins hovering

about the campus with high-powered
rifles and bombs must have been
rather disquieting," he added.
Spalding has made several other
trips to Europe in order to do re
search and collect material for the
Hoover Library. He was in Berlin
when the Nazis got their setback iri
the November elections of 1032, arid
spent the last months of World War
II in France, Belgium, Switzerland,
and Western Germany.
Taught History
He has taught history courses at
Stanford off and on since 1935. In
1947 he left to enter private busi
ness. He is still associated with a
company that manufactures food
products. However, he has arranged
his affairs so that be is now able to
teach and write full time.
Spalding was with the OSS during
the war. He was the administrative
assistant to the chief of his division
and kept tab of the research proj
ects. Later, as a member of the San
Francisco office, he did the hiring for
undercover work in Europe and Asia.
More than once he was able to help
Stanford alumni switch from the In
fantry to a more interesting type of
"field work."
Spalding has also worked on la
bor problems. To test out his facts

and theories, he has taken jobs in I
mining, logging, and harvesting.
Projects on Russia
At, present he's working on two
research projects with Mrs. Xenia j
Eudin. One project is a study of the i
"formative years" of Russia's Com- \
munist dictatorship. The other proj
ect is a collection of documents on
the "forgotten war" of 1918, when
both the Allies and the Central Pow
ers intexvened in Russia after the
Bolshevik revolution. When these
projects are finished, he intends to do
research on democracy in Western
Europe, particularly during the 20th
century.
Spalding is married and has two
children. He says that he has a hard
time arguing with his wife. As a
schoolgirl, she used to meet—and
"lay down the taw"—to Chiel Jus
tice Hughes when he was taking his
morning walks.

ing football there, Spalding received
a fellowship to study in Europe.
While at the University of Paris, he
became interested in the Russian
Revolution and the subsequent fam
ine and so asked to join the Hoover
Relief Project. In the summer of
1922, therefore he was sent to Russia
to help administer the famine relief.
Surplus Food
"It was very difficult to fight the
Soviet propaganda," he said. The
Communists said that America was
sending over food to help the Ameri
can farmers because of an alleged
over-production of food.
He also found it quite a problem
to keep the Communists from gain
ing control of some of the food.
Spalding found it difficult to get food
to some nuns in a convent, for in
stance. The Communists said the
nuns were parasites and that only
productive workers ought to be fed.
He went to Europe again in 1930,
and spent several months in Russia
at the time the first Five Year Plan
was being speeded up. Since it was
becoming dangerous to associate with
foreigners, Spalding found it bard to
get acquainted with the Russian peo
ple. Even so, the people were al
lowed to criticize. However, they
were only allowed to criticize how
orders were carried out, but not what
was carried out.
Meets Trotsky
In 1938 he went to Mexico to se
cure material on Russia from Leon
Trotsky. When he told Trotsky about
the work the Hoover Library was
doing in studying revolutions, the
Russian was eager to come and help.
However, Trotsky's plan to visit
the United States was never carried
out, "probably to the relief of the
Palo Alto police and the Stanford ad
ministration," Spalding said.
"The thought of assassins hovering

about the campus with high-powered
rifles and bombs must have been
rather disquieting," he added.
Spalding has made several other
trips to Europe in order to do re
search and collect material for the
Hoover Library. He was in Berlin
when the Nazis got their setback iri
the November elections of 1032, arid
spent the last months of World War
II in France, Belgium, Switzerland,
and Western Germany.
Taught History
He has taught history courses at
Stanford off and on since 1935. In
1947 he left to enter private busi
ness. He is still associated with a
company that manufactures food
products. However, he has arranged
his affairs so that be is now able to
teach and write full time.
Spalding was with the OSS during
the war. He was the administrative
assistant to the chief of his division
and kept tab of the research proj
ects. Later, as a member of the San
Francisco office, he did the hiring for
undercover work in Europe and Asia.
More than once he was able to help
Stanford alumni switch from the In
fantry to a more interesting type of
"field work."
Spalding has also worked on la
bor problems. To test out his facts

and theories, he has taken jobs in I
mining, logging, and harvesting.
Projects on Russia
At, present he's working on two
research projects with Mrs. Xenia j
Eudin. One project is a study of the i
"formative years" of Russia's Com- \
munist dictatorship. The other proj
ect is a collection of documents on
the "forgotten war" of 1918, when
both the Allies and the Central Pow
ers intexvened in Russia after the
Bolshevik revolution. When these
projects are finished, he intends to do
research on democracy in Western
Europe, particularly during the 20th
century.
Spalding is married and has two
children. He says that he has a hard
time arguing with his wife. As a
schoolgirl, she used to meet—and
"lay down the taw"—to Chiel Jus
tice Hughes when he was taking his
morning walks.
