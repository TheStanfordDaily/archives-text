# Golfers Get NCAA Bid; Play Spartans Tomorrow
## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
Coach Bud Finger and six var
sity golfers will definitely go to the
NCAA championships at Albuquer
que next month. This was officially
revealed by Athletic Director A!
Masters yesterday after nearly a
week of suspense.
Finger was elated yesterday be
cause he will be able to take a full
team instead of only four men. The
week's squabbling was over wheth
er the Indians would send four or
six men.
Lots of Teams
Around 50 teams are expected to
compete in the tourney, which will
run from June 25 to July 1. The
team championship will be decided
on June 2(5 anil 27. The individual
championship will follow.
Coach Finger will not decide defi
nitely which Stanford men will
make the trip until next month. The
regular sixsome, however, composed
of Bud Moe, Bob Crozier, Dick Mc-
Elyeu, Jack Knosher, Dave Mitten,
and John Wallace, is expected to
get the nod.
Meanwhile the Indians have one
mure hurdle before the nationals.
Tomorrow morning at !) they will
take on the San Jose State Spartans
on the local course. The Indians de
feated the Spartans 17-10 in their
first meeting of the year at L;i Rin
conada,
Crozier Out ,
Tomorrow morning's match may
be closer, however, because the In
dians will be forced to play without
Bob Crozier. Crozier, who has been
the Indians' most consistent golfer
this season, strained a muscle in his
hand and wlil be unable to play for
several weeks.
John E'liott will replace Crozier
tomorrow. Elliott has not played a
round over 75 in the last three
weeks, and it will be his first chance

to make the team. He has not com
peted in a varsity mdtch yet.
The Spartans' four top men are
capable of giving any team in the
country a tough time. Warren Mc-
Carty, NCI individual champion,
Jay Hopkins, Joe Zucharian, and
Dick King will cause the* Indians a
kit of trouble.
Card Frosh Play
The freshman golfers will also get
a workout this weekend. They will
meet Bellarmine High this after
noon at 1, and will take on Modesto
JC, the California junior college
champs, following the varsity match
tomorrow morning. Both matches
will be played on the Stanford
course.
Art Schroeder and Roland Conk
ling will lead the Papooses in these
matches. They have both come
through with very good golf this
year.
