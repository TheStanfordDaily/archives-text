NEW YORK, May 25 f/P) â€”Yale's
attempt to dethrone Michigan State
as team champion in the IC4A track
meet may depend on whether the
*Elis' George Wade can outrun fa
vored Bill Mack in two crucial races.
Paced by shot putter Jim FucHs
and discus thrower Vic Frank, Yale
is fairly sure of several firsts and
seconds in the field events, enough
to net nearly 30 points. Most con
tending coaches agree 30 or more
points are needed to win the team
title. Wade is counted on for addi
tional vital points.
Michigan State hopes Hkst on its
fine distance runners, led by the
versatile Mack. Only three other
schools of the 47 entered New York
University. Seton Hall, and Cornell
are given a chance for the cham
pionship.
