# Records Shattered In Mural Swim Heats; Finals in Afternoon
## 
### 
This year's intramural swim meet
could be labeled the best ever; this
was established when 175 mermen
took part in the heats yesterday,
and four new records were set.
Finals will take place this after
noon in the Encina Pools, starting
at 4. The seven events are the 50
freestyle, 75 breaststroke, 100 free
style, 75 backstroke, 150 freestyle,
200 relay, and the diving.
Freestylers Hot
Records were set in all the free
style events yesterday. Right off
the bat, in the 50 free, Bob Grisemer
of the ATO's churned the distance
in 23.9, which compares favorably
with the record of 25.2, and the
winning time in the PCC meet, 23.8.
Don Slavic of Encina Basement won
his heat in 24.0. N
Larry Miner, Biz Boys, who com
peted this season for the Olympic
Club, won his heat of the 150 free
in 1:31.0, breaking the record of
1:35.0. Sigma Chi Bill Glathe did
1:32.1 to win his heat.
Spirited competition is expected
in the 100-yard freestyle, where five
of the six qualifiers were under the
old record of 58.6, set last year by
Don Patch.
Another for Grisemer
Grisemer gets credit for the new
record, as he did 55.7 for the four
lap distance. "Waxy" Glathe was
right behind, with 55.8. Slavik did
5(5.1, Bob Kiddejr of the DU's with
56.G, and Miner with 57.5, were also
under the old mark.
The four-man, 200-yard freestyle
relay promises to be the best race
of the day, as any of four teams
can win. The ATO team, anchored
by Grisemer, had the fastest time,
1:44.7, but the Biz Boys finished in
1:44.8. The Dells were timed in
1:46.0; Encina Basement, 1:47; and
the DU's and Kappa Sigs tied witli
1:48.8.
Steve Brooks of the Chi Psi's had
the fastest qualilying time in the
75 - yard breaststroke, 49.5, with
Wes Fry, Kappa Sig, and Marsh

Pearlman, El Toro, right behind.
In the backstroke, Dick Bennett,
El Campo, did 50.0 to merit the
inside lane, while Doug Thamer was
second in 50.5.
Diving Today
The diving will be held off the
low board, with each man doing six
dives, four required and two op
tional. Glathe is favored to take
top honors in this, because he is
Senior Men's Pacific Association 3-
meeter champ, and second on the
1-meter board.
The Kappa Sigs qualified the most
men, five, but the ATO's must be
favored off their qualifying per
formances.
Men only will be admitted to the
finals this afternoon.
