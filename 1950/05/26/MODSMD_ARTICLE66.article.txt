# Trojans Favored in Coast Track Finals
## Cards Powerful In Shot, Weak in Distance Men 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
With only the faintest hope of breaking USC's 10-year PCC win
streak, an 18-man Stanford cinder squad will travel to California's
Edwards Stadium to compete in the Pacific Coast Conference track
championships.
Trials are slated to begin this afternoon at 4 p.m. The finals v/ill
start tomorrow at 2. +

Coach Jack Weiershauser's track
men, victorious over Southern Cal
last Saturday at Modesto, will havt
to meet the Trojans at their best

I Troy's ace low hurdler, Ronnie Fra
zier, who has been on the injury list
| lor several weeks, will be ready to
I roll tomorrow.
In fact, USC Coach Jess Hill's big
pest problem this week has been
trimming the Trojan team to an 18-
man player limit.
Even a one-two-three for Stanford
in the shot put is not expected to
stem the Trojan tide. Otis Chandler,
who will be aiming to break his own
j record of 54 ft. 91/4 in. set last year,
Lew Davis, and Chuck Hokanson, of
jibe Indians are favored lo place in
I that order.
Strong in Quarter
Indian cjuartermilers Pitch John
son and Cass Bly, who run usually
far out in 1 rot 11 of the field, will re
| ceive stiff competition from USC's
Bo|> Chambers and Norm Stocks and
Cal' Bob Fulton.
With Stanford's Darrell Kreitz |
' missing, the Trojans dominate the I
high hurdles. In addition to world
record break Dick Attlesey, who may 1
turn in a double hurdle win, USC !
will enter Dick Lawerence and Art :
• Barnard, both of whom should grab
1 extra points for the Trojans.
The runners had better watch out
] when Bud Held, George Roseme, and

Cy Young, three of the nation's top
spar throwers, let loose in Edwards
Stadium's short javelin field. Held's
only defeat of the year was at the
hands of Young at Fresno two weeks
ago.
Stanford's slim hope for victory lies
n the performances of several
Morthern Division tracksters. Dick
Doyle of Montana, who has been
credited with a tremendous 16G ft.
10 in. discus throw, could edge Troy's
consistent Sim Iness, who is favored
lo take the event.
Hurdler Jack Burke of Washing
ton, a double winner in the Northern
Division meet last week, broke the
meet record with a: 14 .3 in the highs.
However, Burke will probably play
second fiddle to Dick Attlesey, who
should win in a breeze.
Trojan miler Jim Newcotnb and
Bear Paul Mello could provide the
best race of the day. Mello, v/ho is
undefeated in dual meet competition,
may meet his match tomorrow, for
the fast-running Trojan was unoffi
cially clocked in 4:12 in a medley
relay last week.
Gay Bryan, Stanford's chief point
getter, v/ill enter both sprints, the
broad jump, the low hurdles, and the
high jump. He is favored to cop the
broad jump, but may find the going
rough in the other events. Cal's
Donnie Anderson, and Oregon's Bill
Fell, both have been credited with
:09.5 in the 100.
The Southern Division teams must
contend with Oregon's pole vault ace,
George Rasmussen, tomorrow. USC's
Walt Jensen has recorded the best
height in the event this year, 14 ft.
4 in., Ijut Stanford's Don Campbell
(13 ft. 10 in.) cannot be counted out.
It will be USC's Bob Pruitt vs. the
field in the half mile. Pruitt, who
placed third in the nationals
years, has run a 1:52-Hal half already
ibis year.


DICK ATTLESEY, Trojan hurdler,

I Troy's ace low hurdler, Ronnie Fra

In fact, USC Coach Jess Hill's big
pest problem this week has been
trimming the Trojan team to an 18-

Even a one-two-three for Stanford
in the shot put is not expected to
stem the Trojan tide. Otis Chandler,
