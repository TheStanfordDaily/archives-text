TOKYO, May 2H (/P) — Russia's
top official in Japan and bitter ad
versary of General Mac-Arthur was
en route home to Moscow today
under peculiarly abrupt circum
stances.
Authoritative occupation military
sources were incylined to regard it
either as a Soviet decision to use
Lt. Gen. Kuzma Derevyanko's
knowledge fo U.S. military strength
for new pressure on Southeast Asia,
or to punish him for failing to stir
up chaos in Japan.
Either way, it was regarded as a
significant maneuver in the cold
war.
If the punishment speculation is
correct, it is considered likely that
there will be intensified efforts to
plunge Japan into turmoil.
