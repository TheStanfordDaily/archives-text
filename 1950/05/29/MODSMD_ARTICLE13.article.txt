# Unconquered Peruvian Peak Beckons to Mountaineers
## 
### JOY HAAS 
Why do men climb mountains?
This ancient question is still a
favorite topic of debate among
mountaineers. And fundamentally,
there seem to be as many answers
as there are climbers.
But as long as one mountain peak
remains unclimbed there arc men
in this world who will travel thou
sands of miles, undergo hardships
and personal discomfort, and risk
their very lives to look down from
a summit where no human being
has stood before.
Majestic, ice - topped Yerupaja,
rising 21,700 feet, is such a moun
tain in the Andes. The last group
to attempt an ascent was a party
of Germans in IfllJO. They were un
successful.
This summer, with Yerupaja as
number one objective, six American
college students wi'l fly to Lima,
Peru, operation base for a 70-day
expedition to the top of the Andes.
Alpine Clubbers
Two Stanford Alpine Clubbers,
Dave Harrah, '51, and former grad
uate student Chuck Crush will join
four members of the Harvard

Mountaineering Club in Miami.
Florida, June 22. This is the first
lap of a climbing expedition that
will lead them into uncharted, un
inhabited areas of Peru,
To get into the main climbing
area, the Harvard Andean Expedi
tion will take a train 100 miles out
of Lima and mule-pack 35 miles l<>
the mountain range, the Cordillera
de Htiayhuash, whilch, unlike most
Andean peaks, is ice-covered.
Harrah estimated that it would
take a - "week to get acclimated and
establish a base camp. High camps
at 18,000 and 20.000 will he set up
after the actual climbing begins.
With their sights set on a success
ful ascent of Ycrupaja, the group
has unanimously agreed to follow
General Grant's famous line of ac
tion when he proposed "to fight it
out on this line if it takes all sum
mer."
Second Gotil
The expedition's second objective
is a peak in the same area called
Jirishanca. Legend says that it is
"possibly unclimbable" because the
top of the 21,000-foot mountain has
a belt of vertical ice clifls that sur

round it on all sides.
Climbing hazards are maximized
by zero temperatures, condors with
10-foot wing sprears, and the ever
present knowledge that one carelew;
move could mean death. Mountain
eers list the latter danger as "frayed
nerves."
Some expedition equipment has
already been shipped to Peru, but
most of the food will be purchased
after they arrive in Lima. Their
packs wi'l consist mainly of dehy
drated foods, since each man's pack
will weigh approximately 40
pounds. Cooking will be done on a
gasoline stove, and melted snow will
serve as the water supply.
Supply Plans
Their medical supply is an exact
duplicate of the provisions taken on
the 1041? expedition up Mt. McKin
ley in Alaska.
Clothing is left to the individual's
preference. Nylon is popular with
the Stanford climbers as far as
clothing is concerned hut they arc
going to pack a balloon-cloth tent.
Nylon tents are so cold inside that
one's breath condenses and freezes.
The slightest movement promotes a

light snow storm over the sleeping
bags
Partly to relieve the tenseness
and provide escape, each man is re
quired to include a book in his
gear Harrah has chosen "Moby
Dick" "a nice sea story."
Srirntiflc Aspect
Besides attempting a mountain
climber's dream to make a first as
cent, the expedition will undertake
a geographical survey and weather
charting for the sake of future
mountaineers in that area.
One of the Harvard students, an
ornithologist, will collect bird speci
mens for the American Museum of
Natural History.
All the alpiners are expert rock
climbers; however, only two are
skilled in ice techniques. All have
climbed in Wyoming and Canada,
and Harrah has climbed some in
Europe.
There seems to be some dissen
sion between the two Farm climb
ers concerning the proper training
preparations. Crush is getting into
shape with a vegetarian diet, but
Harrah favors exercise.
