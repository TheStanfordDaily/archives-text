# Grofe and Concert Band Give Great Performance
## 
### GORDON ADDISON 
Stanford's Concert Band scored
its greatest success in recent years
last night with a program of classic
conipositoins and one of the latest
contributions to music — "Aviation
Suite."
The composer Ferde Grofe con
ducted liis masterpiece in person as
the 110 - piece organization re
sponded to the novel effects depict
ing first the take-off. then the host
ess. third a cloud picture, and last
a stirring extravaganza, Motor City.
The audience-pleasing Grofe set a
fast pace in the opening movement
while engines roared, the wind
whistled through the woodwind
sections, and the brass lift re
sponded to the main theme.
The melody had hardly cruised
through the trombone section when
(lie petite hostess, played hy the
delicate harp, oboe, and clarinet

sections tiptoed into the music.
A mixture of percussion effects
and closely tuned woodwinds swept
through an interesting cloud inter
pretation.
But the finale of Motor City
struck the well-filled Memorial Au
ditorium with a spirited attack as
cymbals, xylophone, and trombones
swung into the currently popular
theme. After a final brass flourish
and a fuselage - raising tympany
roll, the smiling Grofe took four
bows as the applause continued over
a minute.
Especially good in the Manx
Overture which interpreted the
flowing streams and pastoral hack
ground of the Isle of Man were the
flowing woodwind passages, never
forced too much in the difficult low
er register.
The Royal Fireworks Music with
the characteristic Handel theme
skirting through the various sec-
tions, was flawless. The rollicking
rhythm picked up by the trumpet
section achieved a far-distant mel
lowness which approached the qual-
ity of classic medeival trumpet in
terpretations.
With the expressive passages in
Holst's "Second Suite in F Major,"
the band shifted from the 'Song
Without Words" to the be)' lihe ef
fect of the blacksmith's anvil. The
trombone background for a beauti-
fill flowing baritone solo didn't
cover up the solo--a difficult task
with both sections in the same
range.
In spite of a short let down fol
lowing the intermission in Haydn
Wood's "Mannin Veen 'Deal Ilse of
Man'," the concert band reached a
flourishing peak with Director Ju-
lius Shuchat's excellent interpreta
tion in dynamics.

sponded to the main theme.
The melody had hardly cruised
through the trombone section when
(lie petite hostess, played hy the
delicate harp, oboe, and clarinet

sections tiptoed into the music.
A mixture of percussion effects
and closely tuned woodwinds swept
through an interesting cloud inter
pretation.
But the finale of Motor City
struck the well-filled Memorial Au
ditorium with a spirited attack as
cymbals, xylophone, and trombones
swung into the currently popular
theme. After a final brass flourish
and a fuselage - raising tympany
roll, the smiling Grofe took four
bows as the applause continued over
a minute.
Especially good in the Manx
Overture which interpreted the
flowing streams and pastoral hack
ground of the Isle of Man were the
flowing woodwind passages, never
forced too much in the difficult low
er register.
The Royal Fireworks Music with
the characteristic Handel theme
skirting through the various sec-
tions, was flawless. The rollicking
rhythm picked up by the trumpet
section achieved a far-distant mel
lowness which approached the qual-
ity of classic medeival trumpet in
terpretations.
With the expressive passages in
Holst's "Second Suite in F Major,"
the band shifted from the 'Song
Without Words" to the be)' lihe ef
fect of the blacksmith's anvil. The
trombone background for a beauti-
fill flowing baritone solo didn't
cover up the solo--a difficult task
with both sections in the same
range.
In spite of a short let down fol
lowing the intermission in Haydn
Wood's "Mannin Veen 'Deal Ilse of
Man'," the concert band reached a
flourishing peak with Director Ju-
lius Shuchat's excellent interpreta
tion in dynamics.
