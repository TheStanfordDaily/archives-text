posing each other on the mound. For
the Indians it was Joe Chez, while
Lee Dolquist toed the rubber for the

Coleman threw a double play ball
into right field. Melton scored as
Jim Trabucco grounded into a double
play.
Stanford seriously threatened to
break up the ball game in the eighth
frame when Klein tripled into right
field with one down. The Cougar in
field moved in, looking for the
squeeze play, but Melton, hitting
away, laced a line drive right at
Cougar third baseman Don Paul, and
he stepped on the bag to double Klein
off.
The Indians were still in there
fighting in the ninth inning, when
with two away, Tom Shaw singled
and Harry Hugasian went in to run
for him. John Claypool, pinch hit -
nig for Herron, hit a slow roller be
tween third and short, and beat it
out for an infield single. Hugasian
tried to take third on the play, but
was nipped, sliding into the bag, to
end the game.
With the Cougars' tall fireballer.
Gene Conley, opposing Dave Stott on
the mound in Saturday's game, the
Indians drew first blood in the inau
gural frame as Charlie Cole walked,
stole second, and scored on Melton's
double to right center.
Stott ran into trouble in the sec
ond inning after he walked two men
and Conley beat out a dribble to the
i ight of the pitcher's box. A double,
an error, and a single later, the Cou
gars found themselves in front by a
\ fo 1 count.
The Cards went right to work
whittling the lead down, as Klein

the Card rally.
Stanford pickcd up single «narkers
in the sixth and seventh cantos to
! knot the count at lour all. However,
Stott tired in the Cougar half of the
seventh and walked two men, after
Russ Foster, who had relieved Con
ley in the sixth, bunted a two and
two pitch down the third base line
for an infield single.
Jack Heinen came in from the bull
pen with the bags loaded with Cou
gars to lace Ted Tappe. Tappe
blooped Heinen's second pitch into
short center field to score two runs
and put the States ahead, 6 to 4.
Stanford pulled within one run in

to third as Cougar shortstop Eddy
Coleman threw a double play ball
into right field. Melton scored as
Jim Trabucco grounded into a double
play.
Stanford seriously threatened to
break up the ball game in the eighth
frame when Klein tripled into right
field with one down. The Cougar in
field moved in, looking for the
squeeze play, but Melton, hitting
away, laced a line drive right at
Cougar third baseman Don Paul, and
he stepped on the bag to double Klein
off.
The Indians were still in there
fighting in the ninth inning, when
with two away, Tom Shaw singled
and Harry Hugasian went in to run
for him. John Claypool, pinch hit -
nig for Herron, hit a slow roller be
tween third and short, and beat it
out for an infield single. Hugasian

Gene Conley, opposing Dave Stott on
the mound in Saturday's game, the
Indians drew first blood in the inau

Stott tired in the Cougar half of the
seventh and walked two men, after
Russ Foster, who had relieved Con
ley in the sixth, bunted a two and
two pitch down the third base line
for an infield single.
Jack Heinen came in from the bull
pen with the bags loaded with Cou
gars to lace Ted Tappe. Tappe

the Indians it was Joe Chez, while
Lee Dolquist toed the rubber for the

The Indians moved within one run
of the Staters in the sixth inning,
when Dave Melton singled and went
to third as Cougar shortstop Eddy
Coleman threw a double play ball
into right field. Melton scored as
Jim Trabucco grounded into a double
play.
Stanford seriously threatened to
break up the ball game in the eighth
frame when Klein tripled into right
field with one down. The Cougar in
field moved in, looking for the
squeeze play, but Melton, hitting
away, laced a line drive right at
Cougar third baseman Don Paul, and
he stepped on the bag to double Klein
off.
The Indians were still in there
fighting in the ninth inning, when
with two away, Tom Shaw singled
and Harry Hugasian went in to run
for him. John Claypool, pinch hit -
nig for Herron, hit a slow roller be
tween third and short, and beat it
out for an infield single. Hugasian
tried to take third on the play, but
was nipped, sliding into the bag, to
end the game.
With the Cougars' tall fireballer.
Gene Conley, opposing Dave Stott on
the mound in Saturday's game, the
Indians drew first blood in the inau

stole second, and scored on Melton's
double to right center.
Stott ran into trouble in the sec

and Conley beat out a dribble to the
i ight of the pitcher's box. A double,
an error, and a single later, the Cou
gars found themselves in front by a
\ fo 1 count.

the Card rally.
Stanford pickcd up single «narkers
in the sixth and seventh cantos to
! knot the count at lour all. However,
Stott tired in the Cougar half of the
seventh and walked two men, after
Russ Foster, who had relieved Con
ley in the sixth, bunted a two and
two pitch down the third base line
for an infield single.
Jack Heinen came in from the bull
pen with the bags loaded with Cou
gars to lace Ted Tappe. Tappe
blooped Heinen's second pitch into
short center field to score two runs
and put the States ahead, 6 to 4.

PULLMAN, Wash., May 27 Stanford dropped out of the NCAA
baseball picture by losing d pair of heart-breaking one-run games
to Washington State College Friday and Saturday on the Cou
gars' home field. The 3 to 2 nnrl R to 5 wins earned for Washington
Statp the riaht to represenl District 8 in the NCAA playoffs at

Omaha in June.
The two games found the Card nine
playing its best ball of the season,
and but for a few breaks along the
line, they could have come out on
top in both tilts.
Friday's game found two unde
feated sophomore righthanders op
posing each other on the mound. For
the Indians it was Joe Chez, while
Lee Dolquist toed the rubber for the
Cougars. Both men turned in fine
performances with Chez allowing
only six scattered hits, while his
teammates were able to gather eight
scattered safeties off the offerings of
Dolquist.
Two home runs over the left field
barrier, one by Don Paul in the sec
ond frame, and another by Gordy
Brunswick with one aboard in the
fourth, accounted for all of the Cou
gar tallies.
With the score 3 to 0 against, them,
the Cards pushed across their first
run in the fifth stanza, as the Wash
ington State catcher and the third
baseman let Bill Herron's pop fly
drop between them, Herron going to
second on the play. Bruce Cameron
drove Herron home with a scream
ing double into left field.
The Cards had their first tough
break of the game in the same in
ning as Bobby McGuire raced back
to the 400-foot mark in center field
and caught Bud Klein's fly ball as
it was dropping over the fence.
The Indians moved within one run
of the Staters in the sixth inning,
when Dave Melton singled and went
to third as Cougar shortstop Eddy
Coleman threw a double play ball
into right field. Melton scored as
Jim Trabucco grounded into a double
play.
Stanford seriously threatened to
break up the ball game in the eighth
frame when Klein tripled into right
field with one down. The Cougar in
field moved in, looking for the
squeeze play, but Melton, hitting
away, laced a line drive right at
Cougar third baseman Don Paul, and
he stepped on the bag to double Klein
off.
The Indians were still in there
fighting in the ninth inning, when
with two away, Tom Shaw singled
and Harry Hugasian went in to run
for him. John Claypool, pinch hit -
nig for Herron, hit a slow roller be
tween third and short, and beat it
out for an infield single. Hugasian
tried to take third on the play, but
was nipped, sliding into the bag, to
end the game.
With the Cougars' tall fireballer.
Gene Conley, opposing Dave Stott on
the mound in Saturday's game, the
Indians drew first blood in the inau
gural frame as Charlie Cole walked,
stole second, and scored on Melton's
double to right center.
Stott ran into trouble in the sec
ond inning after he walked two men
and Conley beat out a dribble to the
i ight of the pitcher's box. A double,
an error, and a single later, the Cou
gars found themselves in front by a
\ fo 1 count.
The Cards went right to work
whittling the lead down, as Klein
enl one of Conley's pitches over the
left field fence with none aboard in
the third frame.

Stott tired in the Cougar half of the
seventh and walked two men, after
Russ Foster, who had relieved Con

Jack Heinen came in from the bull
pen with the bags loaded with Cou
gars to lace Ted Tappe. Tappe
blooped Heinen's second pitch into
short center field to score two runs
and put the States ahead, 6 to 4.
Stanford pulled within one run in
the ninth as Cameron picked out one
of Foster's deliveries and lifted it
over the left field fence. Cole and
Melton both singled to put men on
first and second with two down.

ball to second, which Terry Carroll
