# On 'One World' Travelers
## 
### 
This summer many Stanford students will
join the swarms ol Americans traveling in other
countries. In Europe, the Far Hast, jnd South
America student travelers will seek many
things . . . excitement, entertainment, knowl
edge, and all the pleasures that appear when a
stimulated curiosity is turned loose in a fresh
environment.
For all, it will be a tremendously "broaden
ing" experience ... an opportunity to ob
serve and enjoy the different ways of life, in
teresting customs and beliefs, places enshrined
in the pages ol history books.
Most important of all, however, will be the
experience of meeting the people of of her
countries.
A lot has been said and written about this
postwar world and the vital need of mutual un
derstanding and cooperation among nations.
As a matter of fact, the One World or None
thesis has been discussed so olten that many of
us perhaps have grown to think of it as an "in
teresting idea" and little more.
A lot ol us tend to say. "It's a fine philosophy,

but what can Ido about it?" And we make line
speeches and write eloquent pleas lor interna
tional understanding.
The speeches and writings are essential if
"One World" is to become a working idea. But
without active seeking ol greater inter-nation
ality understanding they can accomplish noth
ing.
The students who will be traveling in other
countries this summer can help or hinder this
understanding. They are representatives ol the
American way ol life, the American person
ality. The impression they make on the people
they encounter during their travels can bring
the countries closer together, or widen the gap.
Only through an open-minded approach to
an understanding of strange ways ol life, a real
desire to understand, can the traveler hope to
win the Iriendship of those he visits. It would,
perhaps, be well il the traveler could lorget that
his country is the most bountiful and has the
highest standard of living.
American dollars are much in demand in
other countries. You can buy anything with
them. Except friendship, that is.
