# Spring Sing
## 
### 
With Stanford students resting their vocal
chords after successfully staging the tenth an
nual Spring Sing, the audience is still humming
some of the tunes, laughing at the antics of the
novelty groups, and wondering how they en
dured the hard ground for nearly four hours.
Rally Corn's job of organizing the seating of
both competitors and the bowl-filling group
was commendable. But what about Ihe group
that left at 10 o'clock—to miss the last half of
the event.
The program started at 7:15 according to the
printed program. It started at 7:45 according to
the watch.
Because of the delay in beginning the pro
gram and the delay in co-ordinating the move
ments of singers to and from the stage, the Sing
v/as still in progress at 11.
Last year, one group went on the stage from
one side, and as it went off, another filed on
from the opposite end. But Friday, because of
last minute changes in the program, ushers
didn't know which group to page next.

If two stages were used by darkening one
half of the stage on alternate numbers, the sing
ers could follow each other in rapid sequence.
This solution could not be put into effect until
after sundown, however, for the second group
would be distracting to the audience.
It was unfortunate that the judges could not
add their figures right and announce the correct
winner in one division. As in a ball game,
proper ethics call for a quick judgment on the
part of the umpire no matter how much the
other team may holler. In the future, let the
five judges make a final standing decision so
the awarding of cups doesn't turn into a relay.
The new idea of permanent cups will cer
tainly meet with the approval of all participants,
although the fine Med School groups seem to
retain permanent possession of the perpetual
cups.
A little more planning, with contestants ar
riving earlier — and a good dog leash — will
make for an even more tuneful Spring Sing.
