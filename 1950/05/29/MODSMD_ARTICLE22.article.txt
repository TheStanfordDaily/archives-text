# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
In spite of the tremendous glee and sheer gladness
which has been evidenced during the past two weeks,
the session with the bull, well rested and straining at
the rope after ten days' absence, and having bogarted
one last cagney, returns to print this morning with the

very latest iri sizzling screwball
items.
SPRING SING: Pardon- my
hacking cough and dribbling nose,
but along with the dogs and the
crawling kids, I took in Rally
Corn's annual gift to the graduat.
mg seniors, the Spring Sing.
Geez, what a way to get your
white cords dirty. 1 got so ex
<. ited when the awards were being
Borbaed, I took out my earplugs
and tried to strangle the sweet

little girl who had been running up and down the aisle,
* tepping on my fingers and toe;;, and generally pre
• enting the most nauseating situation since the last
time 1 jumped into Lake Lag and came up with a
jnouthful of live insects.
Actually, they shouldn't t vf-n call it the Spring Sing
;.iiy more. It ought to be called the Med School Sing.
Everywhere I looked there was u medic grabbing off a
trophy. White coats, nothing but white coats. Next
year everybody will probably wear them.
The Frosh Med School, singing "Old Man Noah and

Dem Animals," was undoubtedly the best of the night
and deserved the Sweepstakes prize, but if it hadn't
been for Dean Borba on the MC mike, and the Nu Sig
ma Nu Quartet, filling in at the finish while the judges
were making and remaking up their minds, the show
might have fallen as flat as most of the performers.
Nevertheless, it was the old Spring Sing, the Life
photog finally showed up, the moon and stars were out,
all the dogs in town were there, a little boy got lost and
found, and everybody sang, except for the birds who
were too busy birding.
Best of all, it was free.
FOOTPRINTS: They can gag it up all they want
about a monster crawling into Hoover Tower, and
Dare Stark McMullen can scold the Alpine,Club until
she is blue in the ink—l don't care, 1 just had to see
what it looked like on a Sunday.
(iOOD INTENTIONS: There's a t;tory going around
that this is the last week before the dead one, and if
it's true; that means there will he only four more
Dailies.
In that time, unless the Editor objects, old BS is
going to summarize all those gems of wisdom and
knowledge which have been picked up along this
thorny collegiate path, and it will he dedicated to
those who could and would carry on.
It has been a grand and glorious four years, but
right now I'd better kiss this off before I get sick to
my stomach.
