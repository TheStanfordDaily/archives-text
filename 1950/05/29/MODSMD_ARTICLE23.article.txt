### 
To the Senior Class of 1950,
I, on behalf of the Stanford Crew, would like to
< xpress our most sincere thanks and appreciation for
this year's senior class gift of a new . hell. This shell,
to bp christened the "Spirit of '50,'' v/ill be delivered in
time for next spring's racing season and will .serve as
a real inspiration to next year's varsity.
Besides serving as a .sleek new race-boat, the "Spirit
of T>o" will enable us to keep many more men on the
quad who heretofore hav< had to be cut, due to lack

Tin* 'Spirit of 7>o'

of equipment. It will last for years to come and will
undoubtedly be in use when the future offspring ol
the class of '50 come to Stanford.
So it is that in many ways, the "Spirit of '50" will
exemplify the true Stanford spirit and will furthei
augment the rise of the Stanford Crew as a rowinc,
power.
Sincerely,
HAY N. ATKINSON,
Captain, Stanford < rev/
