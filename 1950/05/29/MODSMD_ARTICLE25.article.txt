# Young Communists Hold Peaceful Rally
## 
### 
BERLIN, May 28 (/P) — A half
million or more disciplined East
German youths, their blue uniforms
sodden from day-long downpours,
chanted and marched today in Ber
lin's biggest. Communist show since
the war.
The vastly prepared Whitsuntide
rally turned out to be a peaceful
parade, not a putsch.
By 8 p.m. the only incident re
ported involved the beating of a
West Berlin news vendor by Com
munist youths on a trolley car tra
versing a street bisected by the
American and Soviet sector border
A West Berlin policeman arrested
the motorman who had denounced
the vendor to the youths.
But it was a parade which mocked
and caricatured the West, eulogized
Stalin and the Soviet, and carried
high the drum beats of hate —not
unlike another day when Hitler's

massed legions strode the same his
toric thoroughfare, XJnter den Lin
den.
The youth brigades, shouting
"Friendship friendship" in cadence
and clapping their hands in unison,
reminded onlookers of Nazi "Sieg
heils."
Soaked to the skin and shivering

from tlie frequent showers, many
sought refuge in the nearby door
ways and bornh ruins as Stalinist
oratory wore on at the Lu.slgartt-n,
but. were herded back to their for
mations by East German police.
