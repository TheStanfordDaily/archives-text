# Stanford Second to USC in PCC Track Finals
## Six Cards Qualify to Meet Big Nine On June 20 in Madison, Wisconsin 
### JOHN BREIER 
Second to USC in the PCC track finals, Stanford trackmen will now turn
to the Looks to prepare ior scholastic finals and then travel to the NCAA
and PCC-Big Nine meets.
Scoring 412 1-5 points behind the 62 1-5 of the winning Trojans, the Indians
qualified six men of the PCC's 36 to meet the Big Nine team on June 20 in

Madison, Wisconsin. NCAA finals
are during the preceding week.
In order to win a place on the PCC
team, an athlete had to place in the
top three of his event at Saturday's
meet, and get the vote of the 10
coaches.
Otis Chandler, who put the shot 57
feet 4-;<i* inches for the third highest
mark ever recorded, won his event
with teammate Lew Davis second
witb 51 feet 71/4 inches. Stanford's
Cruek Hokanson placed third with
49 leet s'/s inches.
But Hokanson did not get the nod
from the coaches, as those gentle- ;
men evidently thought his mark
would not improve enough to top!
the lowest Big Nine mark of Michi
gan's Charlie Fonville—sl ft. 11 in.
Pitch Johnson and WilLur Taylor
won the trip by placing two-three
behind Oregon's surprising Dave
Henthorne in a >:48.7 quarter mile.
Henthorne caught Johnson at the
tape to win by a foot.
Bob Bryan placed second to USC's
Dick Attle.sey in the low hurdles, j
after leading up to the seventh bar- j
rier, for his position on the squad.
Merritt Van Sant was the sixth j
Card to make the squad, via a 211 ft.
10 in. third-place leap in the broad j
jump.
Three Firsts for Stanford
USC ran up seven firsts, including j
double wins by Jim Newcomb and |
Attlesey, to Stanford's three, Ore
gon's tht'ee, Cal's one, and Montana's
one.
The point scoring, minus fractions,
went USC 62, Stanford 42, Cal :i5,
Oregon 31, WSC 13, OSC 11, Wash
ington 12, UCLA 7, Idaho 6, Mon
tana 5.
Such stars as USC's Walt Jensen,
Wally Pruitt, and Stanford's Gay
Byran did not make the squad for
various reasons. Pruitt tried to dou- i
Lie in the 880 after running a quarter '
and finished last.

man to take up the slack in'2o points
that separated USC and Stanford'.
Bryan had been cleared for the
meet on Wednesday after doctors had
; decided to forego an operation on an
abcessed region by just removing the
[ abcess. But the pain was too great
by track time and the star was forced
to withdraw after qualifying for both
j dashes and the broad jump on Fri
day.
His active competition would have
j helped the Card cause but little
though, for the Trojans spent little
i lime in showing their overall su-
I periority.
All three men could make the trip
though, for the coaches chose only
3"i of the 36 men Saturday. Bryan
may or may not want a position, as
the AAU finals come shortly after the
meet and the rest would be welcome
if he is to win a trip to Europe.
In all the meet was run oft pretty
well as scheduled. Held came
j through on the second of his three
tosses to come from last to first place
with 224 feet over Roseme's 220-6.
But the PCC-Big Nine contest has no
javelin event, so neither lad nor
third-place Cy Young were named
to the squad.
j The Cards' mile relay team ran off
: with that event with Bill Storum
j grabbing a lead that was held by
Wilbur Taylor, Cass Bly, and Pitch
Johnson, for a 20-yard win over WSC
in 3:17.3 time.
All times were slow because of a
wind that ranged between 4 and 10
miles an hour against the runners on
the starting straightaway.


OTIS CHANDLER, Indians' blond muscle man, won his event,
the shot put, in the PCC track trials at Berkeley Friday with a
heave of 57 feet 4 3-8 inches, the third-highest mark in the shot
ever recorded, to establish a new PCC record.

jump, 100, and his half-hearted (to
the observer) attempts in the high !
jump and 220 puzzled the crowd, !
which had expected the Card iron !

man to take up the slack in'2o points
that separated USC and Stanford'.
Bryan had been cleared for the
meet on Wednesday after doctors had
; decided to forego an operation on an
abcessed region by just removing the
[ abcess. But the pain was too great
by track time and the star was forced
to withdraw after qualifying for both
j dashes and the broad jump on Fri
day.
His active competition would have
j helped the Card cause but little
though, for the Trojans spent little
i lime in showing their overall su-
I periority.
All three men could make the trip
though, for the coaches chose only
3"i of the 36 men Saturday. Bryan
may or may not want a position, as
the AAU finals come shortly after the
meet and the rest would be welcome
if he is to win a trip to Europe.
In all the meet was run oft pretty
well as scheduled. Held came
j through on the second of his three
tosses to come from last to first place
with 224 feet over Roseme's 220-6.
But the PCC-Big Nine contest has no
javelin event, so neither lad nor
third-place Cy Young were named
to the squad.
j The Cards' mile relay team ran off
: with that event with Bill Storum
j grabbing a lead that was held by
Wilbur Taylor, Cass Bly, and Pitch
Johnson, for a 20-yard win over WSC
in 3:17.3 time.
All times were slow because of a
wind that ranged between 4 and 10
miles an hour against the runners on
the starting straightaway.


OTIS CHANDLER, Indians' blond muscle man, won his event,
the shot put, in the PCC track trials at Berkeley Friday with a
heave of 57 feet 4 3-8 inches, the third-highest mark in the shot
ever recorded, to establish a new PCC record.
