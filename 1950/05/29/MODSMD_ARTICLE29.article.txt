# Swim drown Goes to Delts
## 
### 
A referee's decision in the final
event, the relay, gave the Delta Tau
Delta swimming team the intramu
ral championship Friday, in the big
gest and best mural meet yet.
The ATO team was ahead, and
won the relay, but it was disclosed
that they used an Encina freshman
on their relay team, a clearcut
breach of the rules.
The Delts took second in the race
and were awarded first on the de
cision, to score 20 points, to 1G for
the DU's and 15 for the Encina
Basement. The Kappa Sigs and the
Sigma Chi's tied with 12, the Biz
Boys had 11, the ATO's 9, Phi Kap
pa Sigma 6, El Campo and Chi Psi 5,
El Toro and Off-Campus 3, and En
cina Center and Phi Psi 1.
The big individual star was Bill
Glathe of the Sigma Chi's, who
scored all of his team's 12 points.
He won the 150 free, beating out
Larry Miner of the Biz Boys by
inches, in 1:30.2, to set a new rec
ord. He also won the diving, and
placed fourth in the 100 free.
The 50 free uncovered two po
tential varsity stars in Bob Grise
mer, ATO, and Don Slavic, Encina
Basement. Grisemer won the 50 in
24.3, to establish a new record, af
ter qualifying in 23.9. Slavic was
second in the 50 by a hair, and
swam an unofficial 24.0 on his lap
of the relay.
The sizzling 100 - yard freestyle
race was won by Bob Kidder, DU,
in 55.0, which also set a new rec
ord. Kidder was followed by Grise
mer, Slavic, Glathe, and Miner.
The two stroke races were won by
Dick Bennet, El Campo, who out
distanced Lloyd Kelley, Phi Kappa
Sigma, in the 75 backstroke, and
Steve Brooks, Chi Psi, who scored
over Wes Fry, Kappa Sig, in the
breaststroke.
In the diving, Glathe won by a
large margin over Dave Cutter, DU;
Stu Elliott, Off-Campus; Bob White,
Delt; and Harry Bryan, Encina
Center, in that order.
The Delt team of Jerry Smith,
Bob Newell, Bill Fowke, and Russ
LaT'elle set a new record of 1:44.1
in the 200-yard freestyle relay.
The meet, run off under the able
direction of Jim Bradshaw, former
varsity diver, attracted a record
number of 415 entries.
