# Oarsmen Prepare For Marietta Race
## 
### BILL WOOD 
If anyone has noticed an unusual
number of eager faces around the
campus recently, chances are that
they belong to the members of the
Stanford varsity crew. For before
very long, during finals week to be
exact, the crewmen will entrain for
Marietta, Ohio, to compete in the
National Rowing Championships to
be held there on June 17.
Fourteen men, including ten oars
men, two coxswains, a manager, and
the coach, will constitute Stanford's
representation at the crew classic.
This trip to the championships will
be the Indians' second since the j
war, they having competed in the j
meet last year at Poughkeepsie, j
New York.
No Time to Relax
But this year's expedition will be
far from a relaxing vacation, and
by the time the Card oarbenders
wind up their duties they will have
more than earned their keep. The
competition that Stanford will face
on the Ohio River next month will
be comprised of the top crews in the
country. Leading the field of en- ■
trants will be the usual favorites. :
California and Washington, this I
year predicted to give their oppo- j
nents even more truoble because of j
their unusually fierce rivalry cen- j
tering around the UW's recent nar
row victory over the Bears. Also
not to be overlooked are MlT's j
Eastern Division champs, who will ■
undoubtedly give their Western ri
vals a real run for their money.
Cards Are a "Dark Ilorse"'
However, there's a "dark horse"
in every race, and, considering their |
impressive showing against last ]
year's national champs from Berke- j
ley, it could very well be that the j
men from Mr. Stanford's Farm will
hand their favored opponents a sur
prise or two. At any rate, the ex- i
perts won't be picking a winner j
until the last shell has crossed the I
finish line.

Up until Ihe day of their depar
ture for Marietta the Card crewmen
will be having daily practice ses
sions, preparing themselves for the
Big Race. Most of their time will be
spent in long training runs, in an
effort to get in shape for their four
mile jaunt on the Ohio. The chief
handicap that the Indian oarsmen
face in their preparations is that
they have no second crew which can
keep up with them and press them
in their practice sprints. The fact
that they have no trial races be
tween now and the Marietta finale
may also prove to be a detriment to
their chances.
Win, lose, or draw, however,
Stanford's crew is certain to win
considerable acclaim for being the
only completely independent or
ganization entered in the champior. -
ships. But no one on the varsity
crew is looking for that kind of
laurels; they have their eyes on
something u little more important.
Just ask a crewman!
