# High Taxes an Obstacle

### 
WASHINGTON â€” High income
taxes on businesses and individuals
are a breeder of high price in
creases and the biggest tax obstacle
to industrial growth, a Brookings
Institution study said today.
The study, based on reports from
business firms and prepared by
economist Lewis H. Kimmel, sug
gests some moderate tax changes
now, to be followed gradually by
deeper cuts as federal finances im
prove.
"A tax policy that will promote
economic expansion and high level
income is imperative," Kimmel said.
