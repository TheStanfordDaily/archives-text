# Runaway Quail Cause Minor Traffic Jam
## 
### 
A dozen baby quail were the
unknowing cause of a minor traf
fic jam on Santa Teresa Street in
front of Itohle yesterday after
noon. The quail had strayed from
their home in a vacant lot and
wandered into the street.
Traffic was almost at a standstill
for 15 minutes, while passers-by
stopped their cars to return the
runaways to their nest.
The young birds were cut off
from their homes by the curbing,
which was nearly three times as
tall as they were.
The elusive quail were returned
one by one to their nest, and traf
fic returned to normal after the
short interruption.
