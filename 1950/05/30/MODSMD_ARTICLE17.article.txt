'ilte melting tar faiily spattered under the wheels of campus cars yes
terday afternoon as the mercury climbed to an unprecedented 97 degrees
in the Palo Alto area. 4
"It's the hottest day we've ever had in May," the Palo Alto Weather
Office reported. (Previous record had been 9!5 degrees.)
llerc on campus, the thermometer outside the steam plant rose to 95
degrees in the shade.
In answer to what was the warmest 12 hours of the year, the Univer
sity's administration offices in the sizzling temporary buildings closed
down for the afternoon at 2 p.m.
"Evidently the only two reasonably cool places on campus are Mrs.
Sumner's apartments in Encina and the air-conditioned Law School,"
Business Manager Alf Brandin reported. Braudin said it was 84 degrees
in his Encina office, and "everyone is in shirtsleeves."
Vet students evidently weathered the heat in true San Joaquin Valley
style. Lake Lag came up with no more than its usual number of swim
mers, while more than a few tan-seekers sought out secluded lawns and
roof tops to take lnll advantage of Old Sol.
