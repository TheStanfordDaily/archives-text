# Sadie Bares Her Identity
## 
### 
Stanford Sadie came clean last
night.
Elaine Marcus, freshman from
San Mateo, admitted to her radio
audience that she has played the
sultry siren on KZSU for the past
quarter.
The pretty Roble girl is 5 feet 2
inches tall, has dark hair and brown
eyes. A speech and drama major,
she plans to go into television after
graduation.
Each quarter a different Stanford
maiden is chosen to portray KZSU's
Sadie, a deep-voiced femme fatale
who allegedly lures all Stanford
roughs away from their studies to
listen to her murmurings. The
campus station will hold auditions
at the beginnnig of fall quarter to
choose a new Sadie.
When asked how she liked the
job, Elaine replied, "Oh, terrific!"
