# Canine Tail-Wagger Gets in the Act At Stanford Spring Sing, Gridiron
## 
### CALEB CHITWOOD 
(As Told to Tom Shawver)
Like it says in the byline, the
name is Caleb Chit wood which
probably doesn't ring bells with
anyone but Mrs. E. C Chit wood,
the lady who pays for ray license
every year.
Most people know me only as "the
omnipresent spaniel" or "the dog
who was there." As a matter of
fact, those titles are very apropos
bet :ause I make it my business to be
seen at every important Stanford
function, including band concerts,
sunrise services, inaugural ceremo
nies, and Rally Com meetings.
Jnst for the record I am a red and
while springer spaniel, license
number 1603, and am approximately
two and a half years o'd. That's the
human equivalent of 15 years, they
tell me, so I'm just at that difficult
age when I think I have to be show
ing ofT continually in older to let
people feel the full impact of my
personality.
My latest appcarance was at the
Spring Sing last Friday and I must
say that I was rather pleased with
myse'f on that one. It all looked
like pure accident, the way 1 saun
tered across the stage just as the
Stanford Nurses were singing pia
nissimo preparatory to a dramatn
crescendo in their rendition of
"You'll Never Walk Alone." Actu
ally that little act took perfect lim
ing find no small amount of musical
background. I was hoping for a
rise out of I lie Life photographer,
wherever he was, but all I got was
the usual titter from the crowd and
a couple of worn-out quips from
Dean Burba.
Most of you probably remember
me from football season last year
when I created quite a sensation by

: printing onto the field at the UCLA
game iust before the kickoff whis-
Ue was blown. People laughed and
nudged each other and said "There's
that dog again" while I quietly sub
mitted to being chased to the side
lines.
Most people considered it mere
coincidence that I pulled that trick
when I did, but really it took sev
eral weeks of planning and schem
ing. Thai's Hie beautiful part of be
ing a flog, ynn can do the damned
est things anrl people will just laugh
and point at you.
My most sensational entrance
came last Easter at the sunrise
service in Frosl Amphitheater. Not
even Lassie or Daisy Bumstead
could havn done it better.
I just happened to be moseying
around in the hushes surrounding
the stage when I caught the scent
of this rabbit, nearby. Nobody
passes up a natural like that one, so
just as the Reverend Minto was
throwing some clinchers into his
sermon I gave out with h yelp and

came bounding across the stage hot
on the heels of the rabbit.
I thought it was a rather appro
priate gesture, it being Easter and
all that, but Mike, the boxer up at
the ATO house, accused me of sacri
lege. Anyway, I made The Daily,
and for evincing a lively sense of
showmanship I certainly deserve to
be compared with people like Doo
dles Weaver and Tom Elke.
The funny thing about it is thai I
haven't always been this way Mrs.
Chitwood will tell you that I spent
a considerable part of my first year
running away and invariably turn
ing up at the Palo Alto branch of
â™¦he Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals Like any nor
mal dog I was yearning for compan
ionship. and you sure do run into
some characters down at the SPCA
building
Then I started sniffing around
with the boys at the Cellar, picking
up food scraps and carousing in the
bushes. That got tiresome too,
which naturally led me to the con
clusion that people are more inter
esting than dogs.
So that's the way it is. I like par
ties and I like people. So't of a
canine Elsa Maxwell or Atwater
Kent, you might say, but being a
dog. my social outlets are fairly
well limited. Consequently I spend
most of my time making unusual
entrances at public events
One thing more. You might keep
an eye out for me at graduation
ceremonies next month I plan to
raise cain with the Canadian digni
tary who's giving the graduation
address by trotting down the center
aisle with a dead fish in my mouth
just as he's discussing wheat pro
duction in Saskatchewan. It should
be sensational.
