John Howard Lawson and Dalton
Trunibo weer rebuffed today in a
second bid for a Supreme Court re
view of their contempt convictions
for refusing to tell Congress wheth
er they ever were Communists.
One thin chance remains for
them. If it fails, the way is open
for the government to seek a court
order that they pay the penalties
prescribed a year in jail and $1,000
fine each.
Lawson and Trumbo can ask the
Supreme Court for special permis
sion to file another petition for re
hearing of their conviction. But
such permissoin as a rarity.
Lawson told a news conference in
New York City that he probably
would surrender himself in Wash
ington but that he did not know
when he would begin his sentence.
