# Happier Times for Farm Athletics
## 
### 
The BAG, sorely missed since Stanford re
aumed intercollegiate athletics altei the war, is
lunctioning once again, and the sports outlook
on the Farm is tar brighter.
It's called the Stanford Athletic Board now,
not the Board of Athletic Control, but it's the
. ame old BAG. The revival of this organization,
approved by the Board of Trustees on May IH,
is perhaps the greatest single contribution that
could be made to Stanford athletics.
The SAB has been given the responsibility
for "supervising the program ol physical train
ii:g and intercollegiate and intramural athletics
tor men students of Stanford."
The SAB will appoint all members of the ath
letics instructing staff, including athletic team
â€¢ oaches, with their appointments confirmed by
the Trustees. It also has jurisdiction over the
/eceipt and disbursement of lunds, accounting,
and accounting personnel of the Men's Physi
cal Education and Athletic Departments.
Probably the greatest bene! it to Stanford ath
letics arising from the SAB will be the retention
by tire SAB of all income lrorn athletic contests
and operation ol tire athletic plant, supple
mented by general University funds appro
priated directly to the SAB by the Board of
Trustees.
Under the late SAC set-up, all athletics in
come went directly in the general University
lund. Appropriations lor the operation of our
Athletic Department thus were at the mercy ol
[he general University budget, obviously an
unhealthy situation.
The BAC, established in 1916 and operating
until suspended in 1342 when Stanford sus
pended intercollegiate athletics as a result of
the war, accumulated substantial surpluses.
Branner Hall, the Women's Gym, the golf
course, the Stadium, and almost all oi the men's
jthletic plant were constructed with these BAC
surpluses.
In approving the SAB the Trustees provided
that "any annual excesses ol income over ex
penditures from Men's Physical Education and
Athletics shall be carried as a reserve against
losses in subsequent years, a rid /or such capital
additions, improvements, and betterments tor
the Department oi Physical Education and Ath

letics and other purposes recommended by the
SAB, as are approved by the Board of Trus
tees."
In other words, the SAB has a solid grip on
the reins, and can plow profits right back into
athletics. Result: better facilities tor the produc
tion of better teams and better training tor indi
vidual Farm athletes.
Also, the SAB has the reins on athletic policy.
The SAC did not; under the SAC, policy was
directly under the president of the University
. . . the SAC was only an advisory board.
Stanford, with its high academic require
ments, must have a high degree ol student,
alumni, and faculty support of its athletic pro
gram rf it is to continue to compete with other
universities in a favorable light, as all these
groups wish it to do.
In return for this support, the students, fac
ulty, and alumni have the right to a voice in
athletic policy. The SAB provides this.
The SAB is composed ol nine voting mem
bers. Three are members of the faculty, ap
pointed by the president of the University.
Three are students, appointed by the AS3U Ex
ecutive Committee. And three are alumni,
elected or appointed by the Executive Board of
the Alumni Association.
Students and faculty serve one-year terms.
Alumni serve staggered three-year terms, with
one man being replaced each year.
The Director of Physical Education and Ath
ietics, A 1 Masters, is an ex-officio member and
executive officer (manager) of the board.
In its approval of the SAB, the Trustees also
provided that, while the SAB fiscal arrange
ments will not become effective until Septem
ber 1, all surplus funds from 1949-50 athletics
will remain with the SAB. That would seern to
get the SAB off to a good start, since the past
year has been one ol high athletic income. In
addition, the University appropriated $40,000
from general funds for the operation of the SAB.
In ail respects but lor fiscal arrangements,
the SAB is now in operation.
Stanford has made great strides toward re
gaining its pre-war stature in intercollegiate
athletics. Under the SAB the strides will be
longer and quicker.
