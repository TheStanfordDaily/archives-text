# On-Campus Social Promotion
## 
### 
All year, student officials have adjusted
AS3U legislation to corifcrrn with a policy of
social life centered on the campus. Next /ear
with a $60 tuition increase, there will he an even
greater need for cheaper entertainment.
The solution lies in the program of open
houses, all-campus firesides, and ASSU dances.
The social calendar this year lias been charac
terized by a decided lack in such functions —
especially during tall and winter quarters,
The Activities Reviewing Committee sent
letters to living group social chairmen earlier
this year urging the houses to take a part in the
program. The results were poor.
Women's Row houses felt men opposed open
parties at the women's residences. The women
opposed the extra expense.
The burden of open social functions in the
fall should be on the shoulders of the dorrni
tones and ol the Women's Row houses. Be
cause of rushing rules, the fraternities can not
hold open parties until February.
Women certainly have originality when it
comes to presenting dances such as "Road to
Reno/' "Hard-fJp Hop," etc. The expense prob
lem can be met easily by charging a small

charge of 25 cents a person -enough to cover
a small orchestra, clever decorations, and sim
pie refreshments.
There has been reluctance among fraternities
to advertise their parties as "open to the cam
pus." After a year of social probation for sev
eral houses, the fraternities are now faced with
only one house which can not open its doors
to other students.
The role of women's houses as merely a "col
fee house" aftdr the football games does not
fulfill the contribution due the rest of the cam
pus. Lagunita fias proved the success which
can result from open dances in which everyone
benefits.
Next year the social program will be under a
smaller and more manageable Activities board.
Where the group has lacked a "going basis" on
which to found a good open house program this
year, next year's board should be belter able to
promote the social calendar.
The board can only recommend no living
group can be forced to provide an all-campus
party, even though it is just once a year. The
Cardinals-sponsored all-campus dances were a
step in the right direction. Several steps more
are in order.—G.A,
