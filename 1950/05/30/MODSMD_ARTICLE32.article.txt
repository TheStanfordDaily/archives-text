# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
De*;pite the 97 degree boil on j'esterday, I stag
pr red into The Daily Shack and melted down into a
i hair in front of one of the brand new Underwoods
to start reelrtwo of Farewell to Everything.
1 his one is entitled Farewell to Crusades, and will be

the last roundup of Bull Ses
; ion's multi-directed improve
ment program which, so far, has
been about as potent as the Cin
cinnati Reds, who in case you
don't read the sport pages- are
about the most pitiful thing in
baseball the world has evei
known.
HOOVER TOWER: Maybe no
body wants to see the place Sun
days, I don't know. Maybe it's not
worth the trouble. Except it's a

pretty good idea. Caught fire for a few days. Edit
Board got excited for a second, wrote an editorial,
and then died. They heard some Hoover Lite official
ay that it would be an extra strain. It probably
would, but so is paying GO more dollars a year.
RALLY COM: Every once in a while somebody has
to drop a typewriter on this club's head, if not for
any special reason, just for the helluvit.
They do a real sincere job during football season,
and art; ju. i t great at passing out programs'at the
L'pring Sing.
But, when it comes to getting up j little cheer for

a baseball team which wins its first league cham
pionship in 19 years, or a track squad which beats
USC (at Modesto) for only the second time in 17 years,
they just can't quite get the idea.
Y'know, if each member of Rally Com took him
self and one friend to wave good-bye and yell some
thing nice at a baseball team leaving campus by bus
to go to Washington State, there undoubtedly would
be a large enough crowd to make the club feel as
though it had something a little extra to shoot out.
Yeah, I know, only eager creeps do that sort of
thing these days.
MURAL DIAMONDS: Someday, aiter l'vÂ»* picked
up my second million, I am going to return and donate
money enough to construct Hall Field, a beautiful
softball diamond in which there will be no giant plants
growing in the outfield, no gaping gopher pits in the
infield, and no holes in the bats. It will have real back
stops, real bases, and real pitching hills.
Then some day, Stanford students woo pay <i(>o dol
lars a year, will have a place to play real soft ball,
which is impossible to do at the present time. Right
now, they'd settle for some chalked foul lines, a bat
ting box, a couple of new balls, and a dragged infield
And that's about all for the crusades. Actually,
things could be a lot worse. There could be no Rally
Com and no Hoover Tower at all, and no Lake Lag
with no water at all, and there could be no open field
and no intramurals at all.
See you in church.
