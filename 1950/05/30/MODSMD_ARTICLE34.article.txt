# Old Labs Form New Technology Division
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Located between Geology corner
and the Cellar and equipped with
nearly half an acre of laboratories
and furnaces is the new Division of
Technology in the School of Min
eral Sciences.
The 38 major and 15 graduate
students in the Division use the
highly equipped laboratories to
work on such varied projects as the
properties of pure gold and the
analysis of metals with a spectro
graph.
The Division, which includes Pe
troleum Engineering, Metallurgy,
and Mining Engineering, was a part
of the Geology Department until
1925 when it was transferred into
Engineering. In 1948 it was again
combined with Geology to form the
new School of Mineral Sciences.
Head of the new division is Dr. !
Frederick Tickell, professor of pt
tioleum engineering, who describes
his field as "midway between geol
ogy and mechanical engineering."

Petroleum engineers work in the
oil fields and in research laborato
ries. From samples of the mud and
rock forced up by drilling machines
they can tell how near the well is to
oil or water.
Mining engineers do the same
type of job, but they deal with
metals, and with non-metallic rocks
such as limestone. From surveying
layers of rock they can tell how
close they are to the ore they want.
The Division has been awarded
several Navy research projects in
metallurgy, and at the present time
holds one from the* Atomic Energy
Commission.
Professor Shepard, who is in
charge ol the project, has discov
ered a way of testing the metals in
the gaseous medium in which they
! will be used, rather than in air.
This eliminates the possibility of
wrong metals being chosen for use
and breaking up after they are in
the engine.
