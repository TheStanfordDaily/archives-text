BUD HELD, Stanford's record-holder and two-year NCAA javelin
champ, snapped a long mid-season slump last Saturday at Berke
ley when he hurled the staff 224 feet to gain first place in the
PCC track finals. However, Held, George Roseme, and Cy
Young, who placed two-three Saturday, will not travel to the
Big Ten-PCC meet in Madison, Wisconsin, on June 20 since no
javelin even has been scheduled for the contest.
