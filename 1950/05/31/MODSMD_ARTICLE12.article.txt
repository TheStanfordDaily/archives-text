### 
TOKYO, May '!0 f/P) Five U.S. soldiers were stoned
today at a Japanese Communist rally. American mili
tary police reacted promptly arresting eight demon
strators who provoked three other street melees.
It was the first Communist violence aimed at U.S.

'troops. This may be but the pre
view of bolder attacks on the occu
pation. Japan's Reds have been criti
cized by the Cominform for not get
ting tougher.
The Communists had boasted they
would have 100,000 out for the
frankly anti-American rally. The
turnout was only 5,000 or so. But
the crowd made up in toughness for
lack of numbers.
First, the Communists tried to take
over Imperial Plaza during the morn
ing. The police slopped them. The
plaza had been reserved by U.S. oc
| cupation forces for a Memorial Day
ceremony.
The Communists, in leaflets, called
the reservation of the plaza for U.S.
troops "an intentional obstruction
and suppression."
But. the Communists were back this
afternoon and were allowed to mass
in the downtown plaze. Sanzo No
zaka, one of Japan's leading Reds,
stepped to I he platform and shouted:
"This isn't a parade ground. It's
the People's Plaza, and wc must keep
it the People's Plaza. We can only
| do that if the people take over the
government."
Students in frayed pants and the
peaked cap . of the universities sang
and shouted themselves into a frenzy.
The trouble began, said a reliable
source, when members of a Commu
nist youth group snatched a notebook
from a Japanese plainclothesman.
'I he four U.S. soldiers, there as ob
servers, stepped in.
