Labor.)
Nursing graduates and chemists
with graduate training will find
good employment opportunities at
the present time, while pharmacy
graduates may find some job areas
overcrowded.
The need for professionally
trained nurses, which became criti
cal during World War 11, continues
today. A shortage of professional
nurses exists in this country al
j though more than ever before arc
; practicing in this profession.
About half of the active nurses
work in hospitals, schools, and other
I institutions; one - fifth in private

Ipiaetice, and the remaindej as pub
lie health, industrial, or office
nurses.
Em p I oy in on I possibilities for
newly graduated nurses and oppor
j (unities for advancement to posi-
I lions of responsibility for those with
experience are good. Educational
preparation beyond the minimum
required for licensing may lead to
well-paying leaching or administra
tive posts in the nursing field.
Opportunities for <Â«rad Students
Employment opportunities are
expected to be good for people with
graduate training in chemistry, both
in the near future and over the long
run. But new graduates with only
a Bachelor's degree may face stifT
competition in the next few years,
at least.
t Since the war, there has been a

shortage of chemists foi basic and
background research, dcvelopiuen
la I and applied research, and teach
ing. Industrial laboratories present
good opportunities for those with
advanced degrees or specialized ex
perience.
While many graduates will go
into other fields, such as medicine
and dentistry, it appears that com
petition for beginning positions as
chemists will be great. In the long
run, there wil be expanding oppor
tunities in the profession.
Pharmacy graduates are expected j
to have good employment prospects i
for several years. But there is a
possibility of overcrowding in the
long run.
Retail Drug Stores
The outlook for the entire phar- I
maceutical profession is dominated I

by (be p">'.peel;, in flail drug
.stores A moderate upward trend in
employment is expected in this
field.
Employment is expected to in
crease r.ipidly 'taring the next few
years in hospital pharmacies. There
will dso be increased opportunities
m manufacturing and wholesaling,
in the firmed forces and the public
health services, and as teachers,
law-enforcement officials, and writ
ers for pharmaceutical publications.
In addition there arc relatively
hifh replacement needs in this pro
fession.
There will probably continue to
be a moderate shortage or trained
personnel at least until 1951. After
that, there may be a tendency to
ward overcrowding in some areas,
particularly big cities.
