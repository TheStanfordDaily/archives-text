# Not Another Lost One
## 
### 
Nov/ that June is almost upon ur> and another
batch of bright young things is going forth into
the world, we'd like to put in our two bits
worth about our generation.
It seems as though those naughty but-nice
pastimes of the so-called "lost generation," that
ot our parents, are coming back into vogue.
Now we think that the Charleston is lots of fun,
that short hair is cool, and that long skirts mean
business for dressmakers.
But we hope that only these outward signs of
the Roaring Twenties are back with us. We
hope that the philosophy of those times is not
going to prevail in a second lost generation.
Right after the war was over, things still
seemed pretty grim and serious. We were all
ready to discuss world organizations and take
on new responsibilities, either individually or
nationally. But now that five years of peace and
prosperity have softened the harshness of
memory, maybe all ol us are slipping back into
the good old ways.
Those of us who have attended universities

have acquired at least a small amount of knowl
edge regarding history, sociology, and politics.
We have been taught by some of the finest
minds in the country. We know what our re
sponsibilities are. We at least have some idea
of what we can do to make the world a better
place.
But are we willing to admit the lesson our par
ents' generation learned? Are we willing to ad
mit the fun of the 'twenties was paid for by the
sad 'thirties and the horrible 'forties?
We at least know better. We know that self
ishness of every individual leads only to na
tional and international downfall. This time we
may not have a chance to try again.
So our plea to this class of graduates is: take
time out from your money-making and your
diaper-washing to think about the nation and its
politics, work for peace and liberty for all the
world. If each individual does not want a bet
ter world enough to at least devote some time
to it, he cannot ask others to do so for him.
This time we can't blame our parents —it'll be
our fault.—M.K.
