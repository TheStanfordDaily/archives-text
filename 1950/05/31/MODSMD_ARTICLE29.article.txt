# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
To the Editor:
Friends tell me that a Daily columnist, whose col
umn 1 seldom read, cites me as "scolding the Alpine
Club" for Hoover Tower invasion and footprinting.
The columnist obviously does not read letters he
comments on, which is just as obviously his affair, no
one else's. However, as the Alpine Club should know,
if it does not, my letter spoke only ot "skilled climb
er::," not organized and responsible ones. The letter
specifically stated that good mountaineers did not do
â€¢ uch show-off and dangerous stunts, in my experience,
and if I need to state that in my opinion ihe Alpine
Club must be a group of good mountaineers, I am de
lighted to do so. If it should turn out that any indi
viduals among their members did go haywire and
stunt on a University building, that still absolves ihe
(.'lub of responsibility.
if the columnist chooses to cast aspersions on the
Alpine Club, that is his right. To attribute them to
someone else is yellow journalism.

Health Service Benefits

To the Editor:
I wonder how many students know and appreciate
the extent and quality of the benefits of the Student
Health Service. These have just been dramatically
brought home to me.
Taking advantage of these benefits before leaving
Stanlord this June, I entered the hospital for surgery
of a non-emergency nature. Even without regard for
the financial aspect (taken care of entirely by the
Health Service), the operation would normally have
been postponed. This could have been fatal in my case,
as only the surgery itself could and did reveal.
The point I want to make is more than that of per
sonal gratitude. I wish more students to realize, as t
did not, the promptness, completeness, and high-pro
fessional competence of the Student Health Program
in serving thein in any circumstances fo need.
