# Hoedowners Active In Bay Area Events
## 
### PAULINE KUNZ 
Do you have the urge to "let off
steam" in defiance of the sedate at
mosphere of University life? Do
you tire of scholarly voices, rustling
papers, and hushed classes?
Drop in any Thursday night at
the Dance Studio in the Women's
Gymnasium and you will see how
one group of Stanford students has
solved the problem. The Hoedown
ers' solution is simpleâ€”folk danc
ing. It is also fun.
The Russian Slier, in which the
men do a dance version of "follow
the leader," the Shindiggers' Polka,
the beer-garden roll of Bruner Lus
tig, or the catchy syncopation of a
Hambo are guaranteed to chase
away those academic blues.
Many Projects
In addition to their weekly dance
fests, the Hoedowners have been
active in many other projects which
have made their group well known
both on the Stanford campus and
in the Bay Area.
The Hoedowners are the first col
lege group to be asked to partici
pate in the yearly event sponsored
by the Folk Dance Federation of
California. In the "American Par
ty" at Monterey last weekend,
Stanford dancers demonstrated two
American squares.
For two winters now, the Hoe
downers have enjoyed weekends at
Yosemite National Park. In return
for teaching the folk-dance group
at Camp Curry and for giving ex
hibition dances at the Ahwahnee
Hotel, the Hoedowners were guests
of the Yosemite Park and Curry
Company.
East' Bay
The Stanford Mothers' Club of
the East Bay Area has invited the
Hoedowners for several years to a

barbecue dinner and swimming
party at Lafayette. The folk danc
ers have presented programs of
English and German dances for
their hosts.
During the winter quarter, Hoe
downers sponsored a Square Dance
Jamboree on the campus. They in
vited square dance groups from
nearby communities to facilitate the
exchange of ideas, to learn new
dances, and to enjoy "alemaning
left" under new callers.
Mrs. Miriam Lidster has spon
sored the Hoedowners since the
group was formed ten years ago.
It is probably the only group on the
Stanford campus where the ratio is
reversed, for the women outnumber
the men.
