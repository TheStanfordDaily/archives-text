# Thru Breier's Pipe

### JOHN BREIER 
From the time one first starts to write a column in a college newspaper,
lit plans and thinks about that "last one." Then, when the time comes, the
mind blurs and all those nice and not-so-nice things thai you had planned
t< say just don't seem to come out.
And so today the pipe puffs its last.
Four years back Stanford was a great and strange thing to the incoming
freshman. The football players, the coaches, the Dean of Students, and their
like were unreachable bodies.
Iiul through the years one becomes closer to the school and its makeup.
Those unreachables become your friends and you grow into the feeling
that is Stanford.
It is true that familiarity breeds contempt—in some cases. But 1 have
found the reverse to be true in most instances. The much-maligned Di
rector of Athletics becomes another guy trying to do a good job with little
funds and lots of interference. True, he drops the ball every now and then,
but who doesn't?
'1 he Dean of Students becomes one of the best fellows ever. The coaches
are found to be just a bunch of Joes working at a job that invites criticism.
lVlost of them are serious, well-meaning men, and some are slackers who
ju:;t are not fitted to their jobs.
And then the inind wanders back again to the first (lays—those days in
III when football was trying for a comeback on the Farm. We lost Lloyd
Merriman to Cincinnati that summer, and it has been with deep and
abiding pleasure that I've seen the Reds lose ball games and it is with
great joy that I see them in the cellar at present.
For 1 am one who believes that the 1947 all-losing record would not have
been it the Lloyder had come back. But, perhaps it was well that he did not.
For we witnessed Stanford at its greatest that season. We lost but we were
proud. We didn't have the horses then but we liked the way our boys kept
trying.
Then came the '48 season and Jack McKittrick's winning run in the game
with "punk San Jose State." it broke the losing streak and we saw great
things for the future.
But greatness was not to come. It was in those days that an S.F.
writer poked fun at us with a masterly column describing "valiant Stan
ford and its coach who 'looks not unlike Prince Valiant'."
We laughed but we did not like it for we thought our family spirit be
longed within the family. Outsiders, somehow, couldn't catch it.
That was also the year that yours truly hitch-hiked via Army air to New
York to see mightly Army humble an outmanned Card team.
And that was also the year we again booed and poked fun at Jackie Jen
pen but admired him as he beat us for the second time in the Big One.
All during the four year period we in the stands wondered at poor pass
defense and lost games that should have been won. Why? Why?
It was during those periods that the writer stops to reconsider when
the words for the blast come to mind. It is then that one weighs the
Stanford feeling over the obvious opportunity to criticize and come up
with the thought it would be best to wait until after the season.
But we hud our bright moments, tc;o. STANFORD .'14, UCLA 14. And
STANFORD 154, USC 13—the greatest days ever.
And then there were those bewildering times when Stanford's basket
ball team couldn't lose for winning—in pre-Conference play.
And all through, especially in the later years, came the admiration of
Jack Weiershauser who was expected to beat the world champ with a stu
dent body track team. He, who took the death of a good miler, the expul
sion of a 9.6 dash man. and the loss of key men through injuries without a
moan and with hardly a nod for a hard job well done.
Always there was the feeling that we weren't doing quite right by a
bunch of boxers and wrestlers. But then the school didn't either.
There was the ever-present dog on the field . . . the rooting section
back of the third base line . . . the antics of Dean Borba . . . the pleas
ant afternoon chats with Chuck Taylor, Bob Young and the BAC crowd
. . . the trips to the Southland for the ball games, the parties . . . the
Lull sessions with the sports gang at the Daily . . . the faithful few at
mid-week football practice . . . the beach parties. Four years pass so
quickly.
And during those years we've been proud to.have known such stars, and
swell fellows, as Ken Hose, George Yardley, Dave Davidson, Otis Chandler,
Emery Mitchell—good men all. These and others came and went, or are
about to leave. They gave their best for themselves, the game, and the school.
'I hey then pass on to be remembered when we think back on the "good ol'
college days."
Then you stop and regret that you will not be around to watch guys like
Bob White, Harry Hugasian, Bill McColl, Dick Horn, Wilbur Taylor, Bruce
Cameron, and all the other kids with future written all over them.
And then you reach the end of the page and realize that you've written
very little of what you feel about Stanford. You think about starting over
and then you know it would do no good.
So you end it up with a hope and a prayer for better times to come, and
you kind of get the feeling that perhaps they are just around the corner—
"maybe next year."
And even if they're not, that old cliche about playing the game for the
game's sake fits right in to our way of doing things. May it always he
that way.
