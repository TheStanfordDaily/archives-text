## ATO's Beat Delts 4 to 0; Win Intramural Softball 2nd Straight For Victors 
### JIM MADISON 
Jack Bradshaw pitched ATO to its |
second straight all-University intra- I
mural softball championship yester
day, shutting out Delta Tau Delta in i
the finals, 4 to 0. "Pistol" Jack, a |
senior, made his last University ap- |
pearance as masterpiece as he faced
only 25 battel's, allowed two freak i
hits and one walk, and struck out i
16 men.
The nearest Jack came to being in j
trouble was in the third frame when j
Jim "Rabbit" Bradshaw, Delt left
fielder, scratched a single. He went
to second as John Hall lived on a [
dropped third strike, and almost i
scored when centerflelder Dwight |
Bradshaw, fourth of the assorted
Bradshaws in the contest, staggered
and stumbled before catching Gus j
Chavalas' long fly.
Delts Allow Five Hits
The only other Delts to reach base j
were Joe Pinotti, who walked in the
second, and John Hall, who got a
scratch single in the sixth. Clem
Dumett made a beautiful barehanded
stop of Hall's bounder, but was too
far off his balance to make the throw
to first in time to catch him.
Gus Chavalas was very effective
himself, allowing only five hits, but

five Delt errors, including one by
himself, proved to be the losing mar
gin.
Don Richardson led off for ATO
and started the ball game with a
beautiful bunt. He went on to sec
ond when Chavalas threw the ball
into right field. Diek Bradshaw
inched him to third with a long fly
to centerfield. Then Jack Bradshaw
batted him in while grounding out.
ATO Scores in Second
ATO added two mere tallies in the
second. Bill Kennedy drew a walk.
"Gordo" Graham laid down a bunt
which third baseman Pinotti threw
far, into the outfield: Kennedy to

third and Graham to second. Then
Clem Dumett, who was a thorn in the
side of the Delts all afternoon with
his rousing chatter from his third
base position, banged a solid single
to score both base runners.
The last ATO run was added on a
weird play in the sixth. Richardson
had walked, and Dick Bradshaw had
done likewise. Jack Bradshaw hit a
deep ball to shortstop "Shorty" Vi
ole, who forced Dick at second and
threw, too late, to nab Jack at first.
First baseman Mattson then at
tempted to nab Richardson at third,
but the hall squirted into left field
and Richardson came home.

scratch single in the sixth. Clem
Dumett made a beautiful barehanded
stop of Hall's bounder, but was too
far off his balance to make the throw
to first in time to catch him.
Gus Chavalas was very effective
himself, allowing only five hits, but

five Delt errors, including one by
himself, proved to be the losing mar
gin.
Don Richardson led off for ATO
and started the ball game with a
beautiful bunt. He went on to sec
ond when Chavalas threw the ball
into right field. Diek Bradshaw
inched him to third with a long fly
to centerfield. Then Jack Bradshaw
batted him in while grounding out.
ATO Scores in Second
ATO added two mere tallies in the
second. Bill Kennedy drew a walk.
"Gordo" Graham laid down a bunt
which third baseman Pinotti threw
far, into the outfield: Kennedy to

third and Graham to second. Then
Clem Dumett, who was a thorn in the
side of the Delts all afternoon with
his rousing chatter from his third
base position, banged a solid single
to score both base runners.
The last ATO run was added on a
weird play in the sixth. Richardson
had walked, and Dick Bradshaw had
done likewise. Jack Bradshaw hit a
deep ball to shortstop "Shorty" Vi
ole, who forced Dick at second and
threw, too late, to nab Jack at first.
First baseman Mattson then at
tempted to nab Richardson at third,
but the hall squirted into left field
and Richardson came home.
