tainment, when the pitchers and
catchers will cross bats with the in
lielders and outfielders in what
promises to be a red-hot battle right
down to the wire. To add to the en

nllowed to play his regular postion.

The Batterymen have vowed that
they will turn the tables on the field
ers, who won last year's contest, 7

Coy Batterymen
The Batterymen are being rather
coy about announcing their starting

terymen may pull in a ringer in the
person of Bill Arce, last year's team
captain, who was credited with the
fielders' win last year. However,
j since Arce was winning pitcher last
| year, the Batterymen feel that they
I have a claim to him.
The fielders wil! send Bud Klein to
the hill to start the game. Klein has
been working hard the past few days
developing his "bloop" ball and
change of pace. Ready to come rush
ing to Klein's relief, should he run

Charlie Cole, Dick Clegg, or the old
; "Thumber," Tom Shaw.
Death On Fop Flies

ices behind the plate for the Pitcher-
Catcher nine, and he has promised to
turn in a snappy catching perform
| anee. Word from the scouts say that

—On mound today
Hold on to your hats baseball fans,
this is the game you've been waiting
for, the "GAME OF THE YEAR."
This afternoon at 3:45 in the Sunken
Diamond, the 1950 CIBA champions
| will serve up some first class enter-

tainment, when the pitchers and
catchers will cross bats with the in
lielders and outfielders in what
promises to be a red-hot battle right
down to the wire. To add to the en
tertainment value, no player will be
nllowed to play his regular postion.

The Batterymen have vowed that
they will turn the tables on the field
ers, who won last year's contest, 7
to 3. They have promised numerous
plays to confuse and bewilder their
opponents. On the other hand, the
fielders are confident that their heavy
! artillery at the plate will be able to
j bombard the fielders into submission.
Coy Batterymen
The Batterymen are being rather
coy about announcing their starting
hurler. Jim Castagnoli. who started
last year, may get the starting nod
again. Other sources hint that it may
be Dick Corzine. However, word via
the grapevine claims that the Bat
terymen may pull in a ringer in the
person of Bill Arce, last year's team
captain, who was credited with the
fielders' win last year. However,
j since Arce was winning pitcher last
| year, the Batterymen feel that they
I have a claim to him.
The fielders wil! send Bud Klein to
the hill to start the game. Klein has
been working hard the past few days
developing his "bloop" ball and
change of pace. Ready to come rush
ing to Klein's relief, should he run
into trouble, will be "Fireballer"
Charlie Cole, Dick Clegg, or the old
; "Thumber," Tom Shaw.
Death On Fop Flies
Tony Stellar has offered his serv
ices behind the plate for the Pitcher-
Catcher nine, and he has promised to
turn in a snappy catching perform
| anee. Word from the scouts say that
Stellar is death on pop fly balls near
the dish.

Starting around the infield for the
batterymcn, Bill Herron will be hold
ing down the initial bag. Jim Clay
pool will be guarding the keystone
sack, while Jack Heinen will be hold
ing down the hot coiner at third base.
Probable starting lineups:
