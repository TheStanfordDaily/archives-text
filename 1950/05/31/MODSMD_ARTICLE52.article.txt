# Roble Goes Native Tonight in Traditional Luau Farewell, Held Annually Since 1943
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Roble freshmen will go native to
night when they hold their annual
Hawaiian Luau on the front lawn.
Traditionally this replica of a na
tive feast is held every spring quar
ter as a farewell dinner.
The Luau became a tradition at
Roble in 1943. For years the girls
had been holding outdoor farewell
dinners, using different themes each
year. In 1943 Miss "La"—then di
rector of the hall — and Marylou
McClure, dinner chairman, decided
that the Hawaiian motif was the
most suitably effective and made it
traditional.
This year's Luau combines tradi
tional features with a few new
twists, according to Nan Henderson,
general chairman.
Palm Loaf Tables
Food will be eaten off paper and
palm - leaf "tables." According to
custom, each girl will donate a pil
low to sit on. It is reported that
there was considerable confusion
one year when the name tags fell off
the pillows. General chaos resulted
when each girl tried to claim her
own.
This year the girls will receive

tiny Vanda orchids instead of the
gardenias distributed in past years.
Highlight of the menu will be
fried chicken. Fruit and flowers
will form the centerpieces.
After dinner, the group will gath
er indoors for entertainment. The
program will include a ukulele
band made up of Stanford students
from Hawaii. Each corridor will
present a skit to report on the year's
events.
