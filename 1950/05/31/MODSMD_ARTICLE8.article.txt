# Communist Riots Flare In Japan and Germany
## Anti-Red Youths Burn Blue Shirts and Flags in Berlin 
### 
HELMSTEDT, Germany, May III </}') Milling thou
sands of Red-hating residents of Helmstedt fought pio-
Communist German youths in the streets last night.
The anti-Reds were victorious. Their opponents
members of the Communist-controlled Free German

Youth (FDJ) —begged for a truce<
after their blue shirts were tipped
from their backs and heaped on bon
fires along with their blue flags.
Thus the violence Berlin escaped
in the massive Communist Whitsun
rally finally erupted in this British
Zone town. It was the first disorder
stemming from last Sunday's show
of strength by the Communists in
Berlin.
The trouble began when about
'2,000 FDJ members from Western
Germany found themselves tempo
rarily marooned here for lack of
transportation on their homeward
trek from the Berlin rally.
With the slogans of their Commu
nist leaders still ringing in their ears,
the FDJ youths confidently marched
from the railway station to restau
rants loudly singing the Interna
tionale.
Townspeople out in droves to wit
ness the influx of the highly-publi
cized hluesbirts responded with
Deutschland ueber Alles, the former
German anthem. The singing
changed to jeering — then to fist
fighting.
