TOKYO â€” Grimly warning the
Communists to "behave or else,"
American occupation officials today
pushed the tri;il of eight Japanese
for roughing up U. 3. soldiers at a
Red rally.
At the same time, Japanese col
lege student leaders called a nation
wide "strike" for Saturday. Police
throughout Japan already have
been alerted for new f?ed outbreaks
expected as an attempt to influence
Sunday's election for the upper
house of Parliament.
