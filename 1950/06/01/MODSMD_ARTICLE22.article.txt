# Goodwin Knight, '77, Visits Alma Mater
## 
### 
A well-known otanford alum, Goodwin I. Knight, returned to
the campus yesterday morning to talk about his re-election as
Lieutenant-Governor of California.
Knight spoke for 40 minutes to students at the Cellar 111 a session
that brought raised eyebrows from the Committee on Public Exer-

cises which later in the afternoon
issued a statement to remind stu
dents that political talks aie prohib
ited on the campus.
Knight reviewed his pros and
cons —for a balanced budget, lepeal
of the 20 per cent amusement tax,
and the crime commission, against
Communists in government and
university faculties—and reflected a
few minutes on his old days as a
member of the class of 1 17.
The Lieutenant-Governor said he
lived in a practical world, and
therefore believed that although the
Communists are not outlawed, they
are essentially not a political party
but a faction bent on the overthrow
of our government.
This was his answer to the pro
fessors in the University of Califor
nia who claim there should be no
loyaltv oath because the Communist
party is not illegal,
Knight's appearance, and the ap
pearance of other political candi
dates, motivated the Committee of
Public Exercises to release a warn
ing to political groups seeking the
appearance of candidates on cam
pus.
The statement said.

Board of Tiustees prohibit the use

A well-known otanford alum, Goodwin I. Knight, returned to
the campus yesterday morning to talk about his re-election as
Lieutenant-Governor of California.
Knight spoke for 40 minutes to students at the Cellar 111 a session
that brought raised eyebrows from the Committee on Public Exer-

cises which later in the afternoon
issued a statement to remind stu
dents that political talks aie prohib
ited on the campus.
Knight reviewed his pros and
cons —for a balanced budget, lepeal
of the 20 per cent amusement tax,
and the crime commission, against
Communists in government and
university faculties—and reflected a
few minutes on his old days as a
member of the class of 1 17.
The Lieutenant-Governor said he
lived in a practical world, and
therefore believed that although the
Communists are not outlawed, they
are essentially not a political party
but a faction bent on the overthrow
of our government.
This was his answer to the pro
fessors in the University of Califor
nia who claim there should be no
loyaltv oath because the Communist
party is not illegal,
