### 
In just about two weeks many of us will stop
being students and start being alums. It's
something to think about. You're a Staniord
student fur a few years, and for the rest of your
life you're a member of the alumni branch of
the Stanford Family.
A lot of us want to "keep in with the
u-'.t ol the farmiy. So many of us, in fact, that the
Alumni Association reports more current stu
dents have joined the Association this year than
ever before, This trend make.i sense tor sev
• 'Kil reasons.
In the lirst place, there's the financial angle.
.''lndents can buy a life membership ut a special
late, which means they can enjoy the Associa
tion's benefits lor a longer time a! jess cost.
The most important teason for joining the
Alumni Association, of course, i:; that it pro
vides the means ot keeping in touch.
You will receive the Stanford Alumni Re
view, the Association's monthly magazine. The
lleview is recognized as one of the best alumni
publications in the nation. It provides news of
both the University and your classmates.
Wherever you settle down in fuime years

the Association will bring you in contact with
other Staniord people in the same area. There
aie alumni clubs in more than 60 cities, not only
in the United States but in ioreign countries as
well.
The Association works closely with these
clubs, arranging speakers from the campus,
lootball lilms, and other programs.
The Association also sponsors class re
unions, usually held during lootball season
And, ol course, the Association will give its
members priority on lootball tickets.
11 you live on the Paciiic Coast, you will be
able to participate in the annual alumni confer
ences each spring, held in the major cities.
During the past year, the Alumni Association
made teirific progress, nearirig the 13,U00 mem
bership mark. There were more reunions tlum
evei befoie. and attendance jumped neaily M)
per cent.
In addition, funds were recently donated by
alumni for a new office building lor the Asso

Help keep the ball rolling. A strong alumni
association is good foi you—and lot Stanloid
