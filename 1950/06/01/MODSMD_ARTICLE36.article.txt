### EARL ODELL 
Finishing up in a burst of speed
i" the 1,500-meter run with ;t best
lime ul 4:54.1, Bob Mathias wound
up his practice decathlon yesterday
at Arigell Field with the highest
total in his career, 7,602 points.
Again competing against Stanford
varsity and frosh track men, Bob
had a bad day, hitting three hurdles
in the first event, the high hurdles,
lor a time of 15.0. At Tulare last
.summer in the AAU decathlon, he
had the same time, but since then,
at the Modesto Relays in Stanford
i olors to be exact, Mathias ran a
J 4.5.
The discus proved to be Bob's
worst event of the day, however.
Alter breaking the frosh discus rec
ord with a toss of over 157 feet ear
lier in the year, and with a heave
ol 150 ft. ll'n in. ; t Tulare, Mathias
pulled through withs only 134 ft.
1 in. for 737 points as compared
witli 8!)8 points at Tulare. He fouled
twice while throwing. He cleared
the pole vault with 12 feet foi 757
points, giving him (i4 extra points.
Boh also fell down in the javelin
throw, laying the spear out at 1(52
It. 8 in., just 15 ft. 2 7 m in. short of
his Tulare mark. This dropped 87
points oil his total.
In Tuesday's half of the practice
decathlon, Bob had picked up 225
points which helped him yesterday
in holding up his mark. Up to this
time the second day has always
been Mathias' strong 'lay, most of
his best events coming at this time.
Last year at Tulare Bob entered
the second half trailing Irving Mon
sheim of New York only to pass Irv
up m the second event, the discus,
and went on to win with no trouble.
However, the two - day run of
pventii proved to be of valuable
help to the Olympic decathlon
champ, as it .showed Bob -and this
i: just what the meet was run for
where he needed the most practice
Mathias has done no distance run
ning this year, explainng the slow
time in the 400 meters Tuesday. He
did come through with a nice
-.print to better his time in the 1,500
meters yesterday. He also had
trouble with the foul circle in the
discus, but Coaches Hay Dean and
Jack Weiershauser weren't wor
ried.
As a note of interest, if Bob had
equaled his times and distances of
this season yesterday, he would
have equaled the world record of
7 400 in the decathlon set by Glenn
Morris in HI3(J at the Berlin Olym
pics.
