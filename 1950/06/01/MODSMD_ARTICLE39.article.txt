# Bob Mathias Has Proved That He Is a Real Champion
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
When Bob Mathias, the most la
mous freshman ever 1o enter Stan
ford, inscribed his name on the reg
istration book last September, there
were many doubts as to whether he
would live up to his press clippings.
True, he had won the United
States and Olympic decathlon titles;
he was given the coveted Sullivan
Award; his face had adorned the
cover of Life magazine; and head
lines had splashed his name and his
feats from London to Los Angeles.
But people wondered whether this
athlete, who was versatile enough
to compete in 10 events well, was
exceptional enough in any one of
these events to win in regular team
competition. People were heard to
say, "Mathias' marks are good
enough to take seconds and thirds
in several events, but 1 doubt il he'll
take a first."
Any skepticism about Mathias'
ability to take firsts was quickly
dispelled with the coming of track
season. First, Otis Chandler's frosh
shot put record fell. Then came the
discus mark after that the high
hurdles mark. Within the span of
a few short weeks the athlete who
some said would probably "take a
few seconds and thirds" had shat
tered three freshman records!
The pride of Tulare's greatest tri
umph in red and white spangles
came in the Cal frosh meet. The
undefeated Bear Cub cindermen
were rated even with the Papooses,
but Mathias, entering seven events,
garnered five firsts and a second for
28 points and a decisive Stanford
win.
Track activities will keep Mathias
busy all summer. As soon as school
is out, he will begin training for the
United States decathlon meet, to be
held at Tulare on June 29 and 30.
Following that, decathlon competi
tion in Iceland and Sweden is on
the agenda.
Rapid Robert has declared that

he will concentrate on the shot, dis
cus, and high hurdles next year and
will "dabble in several other
events." His "dabbling" alone is ex
peeled to account for quite a few
points.
Concerning sports other than
track, Mathias isn't certain. He
says: "Every track man aims for
two goals: Due is the Olympic title
and the other is the world's record.
If I can crack the world's record
this summer, I may go out for bas
ketball next year and football in
my junior and senior years, and
minoi in track." Mathias, inciden
tally. was no slouch at basketball
and football in high school.
With all the reams of copy thsit
have been turned out on the subject
of this piece, it might be suspected
that Mathias is swell-headed. But,
not so. If there were ever anyone
who has a right to be conceited
about his accomplishments, it's Bob
Mathias; and if there were ever
anyone who is the epitome of mod
esty, it's the same Bob Mathias.
Mathias is the true meaning
of that much overworked word
"great."
