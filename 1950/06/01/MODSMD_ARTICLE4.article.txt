# Acheson Asks Support
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” With President
Truman's full backing, Secretary of
State Acheson called on the nation
today to support the dovetailing of
American land, sea, and air forces
with those of Western Europe. That,
he declared, is the only way to
match Russia's growing might.
Acheson began his home front
battle for what he called "balanced
collective forces" under the North
Atlantic Treaty in an extraordinary
speech before a joint gathering of
House and Senate members in the
Library of Congress.
