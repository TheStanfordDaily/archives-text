## 
### BILL STOLTZE 
Allan Scherer, sensational fresh
man star of Stanford's best polo
team since the ROTC cavalry unit
was disbanded before the war, is
now in Hawaii with two of the Bay
Area's top polo players represent
ing San rrancisco in a tournament
sponsored by the Honolulu Polo
Club.
Scherer has established quite a
reputation for himself in his first
year of competitive polo on the
West Coast. He is top scorer on the
Indian squad which »is currently
leading the Pacific Coast Polo
League tournament with an unde
feated record, and came within one
goal of tying Golden Gate Park's
all-time record for the number of
goals scored when he recently
racked up nine tallies in one game.
The San Francisco polo team,
made up of Scherer at No. 1 .spot;
Billy Linloot of Woodside at No. 2;
and Will Tevis, San Francisco Polo
C!ub president, at No. 3, will play
two official games in Honolulu Sta
dium (Pineapple Bowl), one against
Oahu and the other against Maui.
The games are scheduled for tomor
row and for Friday, June 9.
The 10-goal San Francisco team
will be playing indoor-outdoor polo,
which gets its name from the fact
that the game is played outdoors
but under indoor rules.
Indoor rules differ from outdoor
rules in that there are three in
stead of four players on a team; the
field is much smaller; and the ball
is of inflated rubber, about the .size
of a softhall.
Other teams which have made the
trip to play in Honolulu this year
include one from Mexico, Chicago,
Santa Barbara, and the Riviera
Club from Beverly Hills. Yale will
play shortly after Stanford returns.
The San Francisco squad is striv
ing to win two consecutive games
from the islanders, a feat which
none of the visiting teams has yet
been able to accomplish.
The trip to Hawaii climaxes
Scherer's first year of polo at Stan
ford, which has included besides his
other accomplishments a trip to
Santa Barbara's Fleischman Field
as a member of the Con Car team
to play in a low goal tournament
there last winter.
