# Crew Gets Good Word On Marietta
## 
### 
When Stanford's varsity crew ar
rives at Marietta, Ohio, to compete
in the National Intercollegiate Row
ing Championship race on June 17,
it will find virtually an oarsman's
paradise. According to the findings
of a committee sent recently from
Cornell University to investigate
the new site of the transplanted
Poughkeepsie Regatta, rowing con
ditions on the Ohio are ideal.
The report states that the river
is wide enough along the course of
the race to permit 1G shells to row
abreast. With dams located every
12 miles up and downstream, the
current can be made negligible.
Thus there will be no necessity to
consult tide tables to schedule the
races, and they can be run in the
early afternoon. A strong wind
scarcely ruffles the surface of the
water, according to the Cornell in
vestigators.
There will be no rooming problem
facing the race entrants, since near
by Marietta College has consented
to house and feed the crewmen. A
further advantgae lies in the fact
that an extension of the B. &O.
Railroad runs just 25 yards from
the river and will carry an obser
vation train during the races.
The only foreseeable disadvan
tage of the Marietta course is that
there is a bend in the river within
the four-mile run. This will neces
sitate the crews rowing in lanes
with a staggered start. If any other
"bugs" develop, they will be dis
covered only through expereince.
As things stand now. however,
the Indian crew can make the trip
to Ohio with the satisfaction that
the only trouble they'll find will be
in the form of rival oarsmen. Moth
er Nature will be strictly on their
side.
