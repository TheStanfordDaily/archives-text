WASHINGTON President Tru
man asked Congress today to let
him set up a new Department of
Health. Education, and Security
undei' a cabinet-rank secretary. The
scope of the proposed new depart
ment would be about the same as
that of the present Federal Security
Agency, headed by Oscar R. Ewing.
Congress rejected a somewhat
similar reorganization proposal last
vear.
