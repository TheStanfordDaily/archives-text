# Audience Applauds 'Playboys Opening
## 
### JAN HANSON 
Enthusiastic applause and a round
of curtain calls climaxed the Stan
ford Players' opening performance
of "The Playboy of the Western
World" last night.
The group had excellent material
jto work with in John Millington
j Synge's superb comedy, and they
j handled it with the subtlety and
I finesse that, such a work of crafts
manship demands. The handling of
the dialogue and stage business, the
technical perfection of the sets and
costumes all added up to a very
polished production.
The group portrayal of the brawl
ing, boastful, romantic Irish was
"delightful. The handling of the
Irish dialect was masterly in that it
! never interfered with the lyric flow
of Synge's poetic lines. Costuming
and sets were equally good, par
ticularly the sets, which were done
by Gene Callnon.
The outstanding performances of
the evening were given by Hal Bur
dick Sr. (the "Night. Editor" of the
radio), who portrayed croehety Old
Mahon; Hal Todd, who did the
cringing Shawn Keogh; Barbara
Campbell, the marriage minded
Widow Quinn, and George Denny,
who took the title role as "the one
and only Playboy of the Western
World."
John Moore made the most of his
part as Michael James, the rather
henpecked father of the fiery Pe
gcen Mike (Sally Casscll); and Nick
Gilroy and Hal Burdick Jr. turned
in very amusing performances as
his perennially inebriated side
kicks.
The show was under the direction
of Jim Haran. Costume:; were by
Lenyth Spenker, and lighting by
Josephine Fishrnan.
Repeal performances of the play
will be held through June 3. Cur
tain time is H ID at the Little The
ater. Tickets, priced at 00 cents,
may be obtained at the box office or
by telephoning DA i'l-OWiri.
