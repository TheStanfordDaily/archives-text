# Art Department to Expand in Fall
## 
### JAN HANSON 
"I'm majoring in art at Stan
ford. Don'l laugh!" Thai last
common! was frequently neces
1 sary in the past. An easy major
: for party girls with nothing bet
ter to do, that was the general
; attitude toward the Art Depart
ment.
'Ihe faculty was small, the courses
limited, classroom facilities poor.
University funds were badly needed
to maintain the high standards of
schools such as medicine, law, and
the applied sciences. The Art De
partment always seemed to come out
I on the short end of the budget.
But last year, the department
j idded two now instructors and 22
new courses. This year, the total en-
I rollment and the enrollment in some
Â»>f the classes has almost doubled.
The excitement brewing among the
I architecture students is dun to the
! fact that, with the addition of an
M.A. decree next year, the depart
ment will become self-sufficient, un
der the new title of the Stanford Arts
and Architecture Department.
It was formerly necessary for a
graduate with a 13.A. in architecture
to go on to another school to get hi.s
credentials.
With the jump in enrollment in
both departments, the deficiencies in
classroom and workshop facilities
have been revealed. Classrooms arc
located in three widely separated
buildings, the Art Gallery, the Art
Building, and the Stanford Museum.
There is a lack of storage space and
no adequate facilities for teaching
courses such as sculpture, ceramics,
weaving, etching, and metalworking.
The result is the formation of the
Collaboration Lab (Co-lab), a group

of students of ;ii rliiicct lire, design,
and pointing who meet one night a
week will) faculty advisors to draw
up plans for a new art. quad.
The Stanford Student Ail, Associa
tion, formed last fall, polled art stu
dents as to what they thought the
new buildings should contain, and
the results submitted to the Colab
and a qualified group of faculty and
advanced and graduate students for
investigation.
The area on the west side of the
Memorial Auditorium was approved
by the Planning Committee, and with
Eld ridge Spencer acting as advisor
from the committee, work began at

the beginning of this quarter on
blueprints and designs.
'I lie result of the quarter's work is
four provisional plans thai provide
facilities for both orthodox and ex
perimental art work, studios, work
shops, an auditorium, a gallery, a
social room, and a materials and
structures lab and yard for archi
tectural students.
These plans, accompanied by small
scale models, are now on display at
the art gallery as part of the annual
StafT-Studcnt Spring Show, running
through June 18.
It is difficult to estimate the pro
portional increase in enrollment that

improved facilities and an enlarged
curriculum will bring Resides gen
eral survey and elementary course:;
available to non major.-., the depart
ment will attempt to maintain a rela
lively mall enrollment In preserve a
more intimate relation of the sep
arate departments such as design,
architecture, and painting.
It's a hig job with some very ex
citing possibilities. For il may well
mean, and the Art Department re
gards it as a very likely possibility,
that when a Stanford grad says"I
; majored in art." it will mean that he
holds a degree from one of the best
i art schools on the West Coast.
