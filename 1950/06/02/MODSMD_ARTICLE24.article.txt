[ J!'i>. almost unbelievable that time can paws
so quickly. Four years, seeming now like only
4 112 )w weeks. A very shoit time.
Suddenly it's time to turn in the key io your
office and call it a day. And you sweai up and
down and sideways that you won't qet senti
mental about it, knowing all the time that yum
feelings will slip through the typewnW i any
way.
' I started in to say "Take jt away, Gordon"
and let it go at this, but a lot of memories and
thoughts began bouncing around. Some of
them 1 want to put down on papei. Not just loi
you and Aland ull the Daily people, Gordon,
but for the campus.
. The Daily's responsibility is to protect and
promote the best interests of Stanford people
and to report clearly, completely, and accur
ately, all the campus news and the most sig
hificant naiional and international occurrences.
It's a big job.
• Your news staff is as fine a bunch of people
cm you'll find-anywhere, Gordon. They're de
pendable, hard-working, and sincere. Give
thtm your confidence . . . they deserve it.
Your attention will be almost entirely de
yoted to the business of protecting and promot
ing those "best interests." Time and again
you'll be asked to define your editoiial policy.
A tough question to answer.
Editorial policy isn't built in a day. You start
with the idea of working for the greatest good
of the greatest number, and then take one situ
alion at a time.
Always be fair. Look at both sides of every
question without prejudice, and then decide
what is right. When you've made that de
cision, take a solid editorial stand and explain
why right is right. Call a spade a spade.
You will find that there is never enough
space in the paper for the stories that should
he printed. Let the choice of news be gov
erned by the number of your readers that will
be affected by that news. It's a big problem

. . . one that needs the constant attention ol
you *nd youi editorial board.
Make the most of your time in this office,
Gordon. I know that The Daily is as important
to you as it has been to rne for foux years, and
that you will give it all your care and enthus
iasm.
Bill was right; you won't realize that you're
the editor until you see that last paper taking
shape. And that always happens just about
the lime you think things are really starting
to roll.
It's quite a jolt. You begin to think about all
the wonderful people you've been working
with . . . students, faculty, and administra
tion. You realize just what a privilege and
honor it lias been. And you're very grateful.
The best of luck to you and Aland the staff
of Volume 11H

you *nd youi editorial board.
Make the most of your time in this office,
Gordon. I know that The Daily is as important
to you as it has been to rne for foux years, and
that you will give it all your care and enthus
iasm.
Bill was right; you won't realize that you're
the editor until you see that last paper taking
shape. And that always happens just about
the lime you think things are really starting
to roll.
It's quite a jolt. You begin to think about all
the wonderful people you've been working
with . . . students, faculty, and administra
tion. You realize just what a privilege and
honor it lias been. And you're very grateful.
The best of luck to you and Aland the staff
of Volume 11H
Sincerely,
lACK
DHAR GORDON.

[ J!'i>. almost unbelievable that time can paws
so quickly. Four years, seeming now like only
4 112 )w weeks. A very shoit time.
Suddenly it's time to turn in the key io your
office and call it a day. And you sweai up and
down and sideways that you won't qet senti
mental about it, knowing all the time that yum
feelings will slip through the typewnW i any
way.
' I started in to say "Take jt away, Gordon"
and let it go at this, but a lot of memories and
thoughts began bouncing around. Some of
them 1 want to put down on papei. Not just loi
you and Aland ull the Daily people, Gordon,
but for the campus.
. The Daily's responsibility is to protect and
promote the best interests of Stanford people
and to report clearly, completely, and accur
ately, all the campus news and the most sig
hificant naiional and international occurrences.
It's a big job.
• Your news staff is as fine a bunch of people
cm you'll find-anywhere, Gordon. They're de
pendable, hard-working, and sincere. Give
thtm your confidence . . . they deserve it.
Your attention will be almost entirely de
yoted to the business of protecting and promot
ing those "best interests." Time and again
you'll be asked to define your editoiial policy.
A tough question to answer.
Editorial policy isn't built in a day. You start
with the idea of working for the greatest good
of the greatest number, and then take one situ
alion at a time.
Always be fair. Look at both sides of every
question without prejudice, and then decide
what is right. When you've made that de
cision, take a solid editorial stand and explain
why right is right. Call a spade a spade.
You will find that there is never enough
space in the paper for the stories that should
he printed. Let the choice of news be gov
erned by the number of your readers that will
be affected by that news. It's a big problem

. . . one that needs the constant attention ol
you *nd youi editorial board.
