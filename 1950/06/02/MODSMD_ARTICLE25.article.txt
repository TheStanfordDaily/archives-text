# More Hail and...

Dear Al,
After four years on the Peninsula's Only
Morning Newspaper it's unbelievable that I
have to leave. It goes without saying that the
experience on The Daily is the part of college
that all of us will remember longest.
More specifically, don't let anyone undersell
this job of managing editor. In the outer office
you see more people, hear more gripes, and
learn more about the job of putting out a paper
than in any other spot on The Daily. You also
hear more from the pressurites. In these days
when you can't organize without a publicity
man, you 11 meet a million of these verbose
creatures.
Don't let them get you down.
Well, Hall thinks I'm becoming a sentimen
tal old woman, so I'll make this short. Have
fun, and to quote an old Daily expression, "II
legitimis rion carborundum."
MARY
