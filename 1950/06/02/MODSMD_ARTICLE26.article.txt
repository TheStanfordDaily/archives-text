# Send the Crew to Marietta
## 
### 
The Stanford Crew can't row to Marietta.
Therefore, the Farm's oar pullers are holding
a benefit drive today to finance their transpor
tation to the invitational rowing classic in Ohio.
Crew members will solicit funds on campus
and in living groups today after coming in from
their 5 a.m. workout.
The early morning exercise is only a small
part of the crew's heavy schedule during these
last few weeks. Besides putting on their finan
cial campaign, they must hit the books extra
hard so they can take their finals during dead
week. Their plane leaves for Marietta the first
day of finals.

The crew has raised $1,000 through pleas to
alumni. It needs $2,0U0 more before the plane
reservations can be made. Once they reach
Marietta, there is all indication that the oars
men will make an excellent showing.
Sitting in the shadow of one of the world's
finest crews, California, and unrecognized by
Stanford officialdom, the crew has made a bet
ter than average showing this past year, lie
cause of its great effort to make itselt an outlit
that Stanford could be proud of, the crew de
serves the full support of the student body.
