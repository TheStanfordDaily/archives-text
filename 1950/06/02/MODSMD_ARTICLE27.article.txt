### JOHN HALL 
Holy Cow, let's have it around the infield just one
time.
Which way did they go? The years, I mean. All
four of them. Or the quarters, all twelve of them,
It seems as if they were here a couple of days ago—
Lu! then, so were the Kappa Alphas.

Actually, we've about slopped
over enough fur this volume, so 011
thr humble, Farewell To Every
thing occasion, I'll simply be
queath a few thing to the next
guy who gets this column, and
theii try to sneak out quietly be
fore the banquet manage] i:pots
me and asks for the money 1 owe
him.
But first, to the future of old
BS and the person who will dish
it out, we pass on the following
hi' t-gasp ideas:

ff you ever happen to be at a UCLA or USC foot
hall game, with Stanford trailing by a touchdown, and
the cheerleader asks for the Axe-Yell, and a few stu
dents jump to their feet and yell, ' No-no, save it for
Oal," run down and shoot them with the nun which

I'm leaving here on the desk.
And be sure to remind me, before Swigart thinks
of it, to sell you my Rose Bowl tie. It looks like you
might get to use it this trip.
Don't forget to take an occasional di}» at. the Ruble
girls. Actually, they're not so bad, but don't M il them
I said so.
You'd better not mention Dinah's too often, because
when you happen to hit L'Ommie's or Humor Oaks
for a change, they frown at you and everybody moves
a few feet away as if you lived at the Deke House or
something.
Always read the Letters to the Editor if you've run
cold on ideas and need a good laugh. II you can't
find anything there, try the edits, an Ex-Com meetin
or a night at the Band Box.
But, if you happen to get around to it, toss in a few
remarks about Hoovei Tower, the littered con
dilions at Lake Lag, and the Stanford roads, and
maybe you can use up a few bogarts just foi the
hall of it.
And finally, it you happen to overhear somebody
saying that I always didn't mean well, in my simple
way, kick 'em in the teeth foi me, will ya?
11l see you next, time around.
