Dear Sir:
The end of spring quarter is coming near, and thus
the time for us to say goodbye to Stanford. We seven
foreign students and the ASSU Scholarship wish to
lake the opportunity to thank the Stanford students
in this way for all they have done for us during our
:;tay.
VVf have felt at home here on the "Farm" from the
moment we arrived, and we have received the most
overwhelming hospitality and friendliiu. ■;> from the
living groups, the student body, the faculty, and from
(Ik many individual:; who all have taken a special
pride in making our stay enjoyable and profitable.
We have been so fortunate as to take part in the
i impus life of an American univer ity, and we have
had a wonderful time. We have been brought into
contact, with the various aspects of college activities
from football games to social life, fraternity life, and
• tudies, and we have learned to like it and to enjoy it.
VVr- are convinced that the experiences we have had
will prove invaluable to us in oui effort to work for

real understanding letweeri the United Stains and oin
countries upon our return.
We have the hope that oiu American fellow student:
also have profited from our small contributions Lo
discussions, bull sessions, and talks; we for our part
have been greatly impressed by the widespread in
terest in our countries shown by the students here at
Stanford.
The feeling that the scholarship has In en provided
by the students themselves in order to promote inter
national friendship has given a personal touch to our
stay here and has made us happy to take pari in this
unique program.
We wish the Stanford student body the best luck
with tlie continuation of their foreign scholarship plan,
and with a wholehearted cheer for Stanford,
