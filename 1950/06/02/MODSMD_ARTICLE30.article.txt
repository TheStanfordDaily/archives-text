Three building plans, drawn up
by Stanford Planning Director El

The proposed building's cost, ex-
I eluding such items as landscaping,
utilities, and furnishings, runs from

Plan C. The latter plan calls for
j larger rooms in addition to a central

lounge.
The burden of the cost of the
project will be spread over a .10- to
40-year period, so that tlie cost per
student will not be much over $10
per quarter.
The new Eating Club Building
Committee, under the leadership of
Chairman McPherson, has recently
accomplished three things:
1. It has chosen a site which will
fit in with the University's expan
sion program. The L-shaped build
ing will be located on the lot north
of Toy on Hall.
2. It has worked out the details
lor the three building plans, whieh
call for seven dining rooms and
kitchens for the seven clubs.
11. It has made contacts with many
club alumni and helped to organize
club alumni groups.
