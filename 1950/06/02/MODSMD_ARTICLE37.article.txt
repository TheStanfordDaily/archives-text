teresting fields.)
The bell rings, the professor
starts to speak, and suddenly
the classroom and Stanford fade
into oblivion as details of French
culture pass in review before
i' j? minds of the students.
Whether it he the French Revolu
tion, Jean Paul Sartre, or Balzac,
Professor Georges Lemaitre always
manages to make France come to life
for his students through his Parisian
luimor and feeling for the dramatic.
While his courses seem only to be
concerned with the culture of France,
l\r infuses his subjects with informa
iion derived from the cultures of
many other countries and times. Most
of his classes are given in French,
although a few are in English,
namely his French Civilization series
which continues through the year.
M. Lemaitre's popularity may be
attributed to his wide background of
education and travel. Born in
French Algeria in 1898, he attended
the Lycee of Algiers and received
the degree of "Bachielier-es-Lettres"
from the University of Algiers.
Then he went to Paris for more
iitudy in classics and history. He at
tended the Sorbonne and the "Ecole
Normals Superiure" where he re
ceived the degree of "Licencie-es-
Lettres" and "Agrege de L'Univer
site." He also received the degree
of "Docteur-es-Lettres" from the
Sorbonne.
From his earliest days Professor
Lemaitre has been afflicted with the
wanderlust. He received his first
chance to look at the world in 1922
when he was assigned to a French
cultural mission in Poland, Romania,
Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The
object of the mission was to seek out
schools, libraries, and groups of citi
zens who were interested in French
culture.
Later, during his compulsory term
of service in the army as second lieu
tenant, he was part of the army of
occupation in Germany, at first with
the Fifth Battalion of "Chasseurs Al
pins," then on the French General
Staff with the Intelligence Service.
He visited the Orient in 1934. In
India, he found it very difficult to
mix with the people because of the
caste system. The Mohammedan na
tives considered him a religious out
cast and would have nothing to do

with him.
Walking by a group of workers
one day who were seated on the
ground eating their lunches, he was
startled and rather frightened when
one of them leaped up and began
trampling his lunch, shouting and
shaking his fist at the professor who
had just passed.
M. Lemaitre could not understand
the man's, rago as he had been par
ticularly careful not to touch and
thereby pollute any of the natives.
However, it turned out that he had
committed the unpardonable crime
of allowing his shadow to fall on the
worker's lunch, rendering it inedible.
Professor Lemaitre has taught in
many countries, among them Ger
many, England, and Canada, before
coming to the United States in 1928
as an instructor in Frcr.ch.
Although he enjoyed all the coun
tries he visited, the distinguished
professor says America was the first
place where he really wanted to set
tle down.
After the turmoil, bitterness, and
corruption of Europe following the
first World War. American strength
and optimism offered a permanent
hame to Georges Lemaitre, soldier,
professor, and world traveler.
