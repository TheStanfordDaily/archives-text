# House Managers Join For Big Stick Policy
## 
### WALLY WHITE 
Seldom heard from, but carrying a big stick is the House Man
agers Association, made up of the house managers of Stanford's
24 fraternities.
Its recently-elected president, Bill Bethke, Theta Chi, has plan;
for making that stick bigger and stronger.
"The Association has great possibilities for helping the fra

ternities," Bethke said, "but it hasn't'
yet realized most of them." .
For one thing, he pointed out, the
association represents 24 fraternities
—over 800 men—and packs a lot of
buying power. Already, many of the
houses buy food wholesale from the
University Commissary. "We'd like
to work out wholesale deals for linen
and other items," Bethke said.
The new president would like to
set up a program to help new house
managers get used to the job. He
would like to see all managers ap
pointed, not elected, for a term of
one year.
"We'd like to help the managers in
selecting cooks," he continued.
"Often cooks are found incompetent
and are fired from one house, only
to reappear a couple of years later at
another one. A list of all cooks hired
and fired by all the houses would do
a lot of good."
One of the association's biggest
tasks is serving as a threshing ma
chine for problems of management,
Bethke said. "It the managers all get
together and talk out their problems,
some of them are sure to contribute
workable ideas to the others."
The president emphasized the
great responsibilities and the great
opportunities facing a house man
ager. A house manager is a book

keeper, a purchasing agent, in man;
cases a dietician, a bill collector, ai
employer, and "sometimes he has t
be a financial wizard."
And yet, Bethke said, "The chanc
of being a house manager is prob
ably the greatest opportunity open t<
a fraternity man interested in busi
ness. Moreover," he added, " it pay
well."
