# Sophs Win As Baseball Team Ends Top Season
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's baseball team finished
a highly successful season yester
day afternoon with a sneak preview
of things to come next year as the
juniors and sophomores downed the
senior nine 3 to 0 in an abbreviated
(ive-inning contest.
Everett Dean, in his first year at
the helm, led his charges to the top
of the CIBA for Stanford's first pen
nant in 19 years. After consider
able confusion, the Indians finally
emerged as the team to represent
the southern division in the play
offs for the NCAA district eight
representative in the national play
offs.
The Cards came through with
their best ball games of the year
in the series, but lost the series 3
to 2 and 6 to 5 on a pair of tough
luck games.
Six regulars ended up over the
.300 mark for the 35-game season.
Bud Klein and Dick Clegg led the
way with .324. Tom Shaw followed
with .310. Dave Melton and Jim
Trabucco tied for the fourth spot
with .309. Bruce Cameron moved

into the select circle with a terrific
splurge in the last weeks, when he
banged out 13 base blows in 21 trips
to the plate to boost his average
from .244 to .302.
Klein and Cameron tied for the
home-run championship with three
apiece. Melton led the runs-batted
in department with 25, Cameron
was close behind with 23. Charlie
Cole pushed 22 markers across the
plate, and Shaw accounted for 20.
Joe Chez was the find of the year
in the pitching department. The!
amiable sophomore was used most
ly as a batting practice pitcher up ;
to "dead week" of winter quarter. :
However, he threw a no-hitter in j
an intra-squad game, and started |
his first game during spring vaca- i
tion, besting Cal Poly 9 to 2.
After the Indians lost their open- [
ing CIBA game to UCLA 2 to 1, i
Dean decided to start Chez the fol
lowing day, and Joe came out on j
top 3 to 4. From there Chez went
on to be the top pitcher in the loop,
chalking up a modern record of. J
seven wins against no defeats.
Next year's squad will sorely miss
the power hitting of Melton, Klein,!
and Cole, and the pitching of Dave
Stott and Jack Heinen. However, i
there is a group of eager young j
men, who played Brave and frosh j
ball this year, who will be in there j
keeping the Card nine right up on J
top of the pile.
