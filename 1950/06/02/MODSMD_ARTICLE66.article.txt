## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Four Stanford seniors will take I
.part in the College Senior All-Star!
I game in San Jose tonight that will
I pit seniors of the four Bay Area
j CIBA teams — California, Santa
j Clara, St. Mary's, and Stanford —
against a team of seniors from
j local independent colleges.
Game time is set for 8:!»0 in San
I Jose's Municipal Stadium, with the
opening ceremonies slated for 8. The
outstanding performer ot the game,
chosen by an impartial selection
committee, will be awarded a free
trip to this year's World Series.
The four seniors representing
Stanford will be this year's co-cap
tains, shortstop Dave Melton and
center fielder Charlie Cole, pitcher
Dave Stott, and left fielder Bud
Klein.
Stott, who was used mostly in
relief roles this year, has been a
mainstay of the Card pitching staff
for four years. He is the only
Stanford baseball player in modern
times to win four letters. The lanky
right - hander saved lour CIBA
games for the Indians tliis year,
i while getting credit for the win in
j his only league start of the year
: against St. Mary's in the final game
j of the CIBA season.
I Dave's biggest moment of the
I season came in the first USC game
i in Los Angeles, when he came in
j to relief in the ninth inning with
I the Cards one run ahead, and the
j Trojans on third and first with one
j down. Dave got the first man he
1 faced to pop out, then he walked a
i man to HI I the bases, and got the
last man to pop out also as the
Cards won their first game over
USC since 1947.
Melton first turned out for base
ball in his sophomore year and was
used mostly as a pinch hitter be
cause he had trouble with most
ground balls hit his way. However,
he spent many extra hours of prac

tice in the infield, and developed
into a top-notch shortstop, where
he wimi All-CIBA honors for the
last two years.
Cole came to Stanford as JC
transfer in 1948 and took over the
first base spot. That year Charlie
ran a close second in a red - hot
CIBA batting race. Last year Cole
was shifted to center field because
ol his speed and strong throwing
arm. This year his oiten-times im
possible catches and clutch hitting
won him a spot on the All-CIBA
team.
Klein made his first appearance
on the Sunken Diamond last year
and quickly moved into left field on
the virtue of his hitting power and
fielding skill. Bud played the best
ball of his college career in the
Washington State series, where he
was selected by the major league
scouts present as the best prospect
in the series.

Game time is set for 8:!»0 in San
I Jose's Municipal Stadium, with the
opening ceremonies slated for 8. The
outstanding performer ot the game,
chosen by an impartial selection
committee, will be awarded a free
trip to this year's World Series.
The four seniors representing
Stanford will be this year's co-cap
tains, shortstop Dave Melton and
center fielder Charlie Cole, pitcher
Dave Stott, and left fielder Bud
Klein.
Stott, who was used mostly in
relief roles this year, has been a
mainstay of the Card pitching staff
for four years. He is the only
Stanford baseball player in modern
times to win four letters. The lanky
right - hander saved lour CIBA
games for the Indians tliis year,
i while getting credit for the win in
j his only league start of the year
: against St. Mary's in the final game
j of the CIBA season.
I Dave's biggest moment of the
I season came in the first USC game
i in Los Angeles, when he came in
j to relief in the ninth inning with
I the Cards one run ahead, and the
j Trojans on third and first with one
j down. Dave got the first man he
1 faced to pop out, then he walked a
i man to HI I the bases, and got the
last man to pop out also as the
Cards won their first game over
USC since 1947.
Melton first turned out for base
ball in his sophomore year and was
used mostly as a pinch hitter be
cause he had trouble with most
ground balls hit his way. However,
he spent many extra hours of prac

tice in the infield, and developed
into a top-notch shortstop, where
he wimi All-CIBA honors for the
last two years.
Cole came to Stanford as JC
transfer in 1948 and took over the
first base spot. That year Charlie
ran a close second in a red - hot
CIBA batting race. Last year Cole
was shifted to center field because
ol his speed and strong throwing
arm. This year his oiten-times im
possible catches and clutch hitting
won him a spot on the All-CIBA
team.
Klein made his first appearance
on the Sunken Diamond last year
and quickly moved into left field on
the virtue of his hitting power and
fielding skill. Bud played the best
ball of his college career in the
Washington State series, where he
was selected by the major league
scouts present as the best prospect
in the series.
