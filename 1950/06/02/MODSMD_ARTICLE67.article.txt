(Editor's note: Today the Stan
ford crew starts its hig Push to
raise funds to send a shell t:>
Marietta to represent Stanford in
the biggest of all crew races. We
thought a lot of people would like
to know iust what they are giving
their money to. The complexion
of the crew has changed since one
year ago when a Daily columnist
wrote: "The crew situation around
this school stinks." Thev are a
new hunch of guys, with new
aims, and a new approach. The
following story, exclusive to The
Daily, tells a hit of the ' inside"

You've probably heard the story
of the Stanford crew in one form or
another. Here's the way we hear
it—in the shell.
We're nothing new around here;
Stanford dominated the West Coast
rowing picture before the first big
war, taking second at Poughkeepsie
by a couple of feet in 1915. We got
started again after this last war, and
have been coming along a little each
year. Nothing sensational, but just
the ordinary progress. Thanks to a
lot of helpful people, and a lot of
hard work, we went to Pough
keepsie last year, after a 34-year
absence. We didn't burn up the
river back there, but we did make
the expected progress that the ex
perience of a big race like that pro
vides. Stanford people there were
proud of us, and so were we. Sounds
a little funny to put it that way, but
we had a right to be. We were the
only school there that wasn't being
helped by the university which they
represented. Which just goes to
prove that a lot of people are
mighty good friends of ours.
Crew Not Orphans
All that is fine, but now we're
coming to the stage that a few of
these problems must be settled. So,
for the consumption of anybody

who is interested, here is the crew's
attitude, not officially, but just from
the gang that rows down here. We
feel that we have had ail the co
operation of the entire Stanford
"family" in the work that we've
done so far. We also want to make
it clear that we aren't crying to
anybody about our position. Most
of all, we don't feel like orphans in
anybody's book.
Just because the athletic budget
couldn't handle us at the moment
doesn't mean much. Mr. Masters
and his staff have made it clear to
us Jhat it isn't the lack of desire to
help us that is preventing financial
aid—it is the lack of finances. Which
isn't too hard to understand.
Oarsmen Need Funds
Maybe you've heard about our
trip to the National Intercollegiate
Regatta that we're planning. If not,
the plan is this: we'll leave Stan
ford June 10, go to Marietta, Ohio,
where the race is to be held this
year in place of the traditional
Poughkeepsie course, and race on
June 17. Financial problems are
upon us, naturally.
