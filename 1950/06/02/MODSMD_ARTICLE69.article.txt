This started out to be a nice sensible column on Stanford's football pros
pects (I'm a football writer, honest, mama) lor next fall. I had ••nivio pretty
good poop, too. Gonna say Miide things about the coaches, and awlul thin s
alout our football players. I was also going to say that we were goiu:*, to
the G. D. Kosebowl next year. It was going to be a real sporty column.
I was going to say some rotten things about all this sentimental borsch
that guys like Breier and Hall have filled the rag with the last lew days.
What a hulluva thing to have in a sports column, John. And who want, to
read a lot of sob stuff about ole '50 in a Bull Session. Terrible stuff.
Then 1 looked up on the wall of the sports section of The Daily Shack.
There are a year's worth of clippings and column pinned up there. Funny
stuff by Dailey; discussable stuff by Breier, good stuff by Swi'art • > at
•tuft bv Hall. Also a few words by the outgoing sports editor me. Written
above the clippings the length of the wall, in letters eight inches high, an
the words: "Holy Cow, Let's Have it Around the infield One More 1 ime. '
Obviously a Hallism. It almost makes me want to bawl. So what happens?
t end up by writing one of those terrible Sports Editor's farewells for a
paper that is literally crawling with farewells. And the dirty part of it. is
that I'm not going anywhere—I'll be Benching it all the way through De
cember. But 1 don't think it will be so much fun—sober -as it has been
with the old guard around.
The sports page, which the business manager swears will be bss en
cumbered by ads next year, is being left in the very capable hands of
Dwight Wilbur, who has been around longer than most and should be one
of the most capable of all time. I frankly don't know what you're goin", to
do, Dwight, without the old clutch-hitters like Hall, Breier, Suinmet/., and
Swigart to at least stand around and look salty. But I think I can say, with
humble pride, that you have a great staff to work with next fall. I know that
every outgoing editor says that and about half the time it i n t true, but
with guys like Digger, Joe, Howard, Pete Grothe, Jim Madi: mi. John
son, Larry Cahn, Wood, and .... well, look at the masthead .... you
can't go too far wrong. Good luck next fall, Dwight. And please, may 1
write an occasional column?
Rose Bowl? Not?
The crack in the first paragraph about the Rose Bowl was no gag. That's
why I'm not going to dedicate this last-of-the-year job to the graduating
athletes. They got their nod from Breier last Wednesday. They are great,
and are mostly well aware of it. We (Stanford and I) will miss them both
as athletes and friends. But the real nod in this column goes to the men of
the future, and especially the gridders who are going to make the Pasadena
trip, if they want to.
In the last two columns we discussed the line and the backs of the 1050
Big Red. We never got a chance to put them together. In my book, in the
spring, and striving for the cheerful optimism I had kicked out of me last
basketball season, the whole thing spells Rose Bowl.
If . . . (Oh yes, there is one of those little things involved.)
We will go to the Rose Bowl next year IF the team wants to. If thc-y
want to forget about their girls long enough to get in shape. If they can
make themselves go into the game knowing that they are going to win and
neither the Army forward wall nor the California referees are going to
stop them. If they go out onto the practice field with the idea that they are
going to blast somebody, and to hell with looking pretty on Saturday, in
other words they have got to come up with the thing called desire. It is a
pretty rugged thing to dig up, but other teams have done it 1 hope the men
of the Big Red can do it, too.
Yeah, we're going to the Rose Bowl next year. If .... if the coaching
:-taff works like no coaching staff has ever worked hefr.ro in getting the men
not only in good physical shape, but in perfect physical shape. 11 the coaches
remember that they. too. can and must be a team, not just a bunch of work
ers punching a time clock. They, too. must share the teamwork, the team
spirit, the enthusiasm that they want their footballers lu have. II the grid
ders must find the thing called desire, the coaches must have something
even harder to find or express—we'll call it sincerity. But we could just as
well call it firmness, intelligence, or—say—how about desiie? They, too,
have got to want to win more than anything else in the world.
Hot dog! We're going to the Rose Bowl. If . . . if the red-hot, slightly
smug, student body will get off their collective duff and support the team.
Not just a Saturday showing. Winning football championships is a lulltime
joL for the giidders, and it should rate lulltime enthusiasm lor the ASSUers.
Also, we can't have any more of the stuff that happened last year when
Santa Clara yelled us out of the stands, and when nobody showed for the
OSC rally. The students, likewi.se, have got to find that thing, desire.
So, it boils down to this, nice people, we all talk about the Rose Bowl in
hushed, awed whispers. Next year it is ours for the taking. We have the
material. All we have to do is want to go.
Thank You, Kind People
Before slamming the door on Volume 117 and my tour as sports editor, I
want to give just a few more credits to the people that have been 00 per cent
responsible for your having something sporty and ungreen to read over the
breakfast table. The Stafi, of course, To Don Liebendorfer, a great help
and a great guy. To the greatest guy I have met on the Farm—The Coach,
Chuck Taylor. Nobody has to wish you luck in the future, Chuck, so here's
just a "thanks" for the past.
To the men in the back shop and their infinite wisdom and mercy. To
Dutch Fehring. To Everett Dean. To Marchie. To whom I consider a fine
man and a good coach, Phil Bengtson. To Bol> Gliilotti. good luck. To the
guys on the Rugby Team who didn't kill me when they had the chance. To
Mai, Bob, and three guys named Hay. To Jack Weiersliauser, who is a
gteat track coach but reads the Chronicle. To all the athletes and non
athletes who have helped so much. And ....
Holy Cow, Let's Have It Around the Infield One Move Time.
