# Excom Enters Farm Professors for 'Life'
## Dr. Spiegelberg, Rathbun Named 
### 
Stanford professors Frederic Spie
gelberg and Harry J. Rathbun were
picked unofficially by Excom Wed
nesday night as "great teachers," in
response to a request from Life
magazine.
Life, in planning a picture story
which would present ten or twelve
of the great teachers of today in
U.S. colleges and universities, has
written to the student councils of
over fifty schools asking for mate
rial on possible "candidates for the
story."
The qualifications Life listed for
the "ideal great teacher" included
the following: he will be a distin
guished scholar in hi? field; students
will "beat the doors down" to get
into his courses; he will be a ma
ture human being v/ho "honestly
loves his job and works at it with
out using it as a means for self
aggrandizement. He will be pri
marily a tecaher, not an adminis
trator or research man or a lectur
er or author who teaches on the
side."
"Dr. Spiegelberg's Comparative
Religions course, although it isn't
required for any field, fills Cubber
ley Auditorium with students,"
Derek Bok, Excom member, said, in
explaining Excom's choice of the
two professors.
"In every class he teaches, he is
putting over a particular spiritual
message—'spiritual' is a word with
some peculiar connotations, but it's
the only way to express what that
message is. His intense enthusiasm,
his magnetic personality, and his
personal interest in students are
among the factors that brought us
to choose him; he is also, of course,
an inspiring lecturer, and has a
wealth of knowledge.
"Professor Rathbun is extremely
well - versed in many fields — law,
philosophy, metaphysics, and what
he calls 'practical living'—and he
graduated trom Stanford in engi
neering. His courses are also very
much in demand, and his teaching
doesn't stop when his working
hours do; he uses every opportunity
to communicate to students a 'way
of approaching life,' trying to help
every individual become a better
person."
Rathbun's achievements outside
of teaching at Stanford include con
ducting of many seminars and serv
ice as an arbitrator in labor dis
putes under the National War La
bor Board.
