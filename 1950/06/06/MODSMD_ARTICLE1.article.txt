Four Palo Alto High School sen
iors appeared before the Justice
Court in Palo Alto yesterday as a
result of a wild night of "mugger
busting" in which they disturbed
three Stanford couples find injured
one student.
The evening began when the
group stopped near one car in the
Cactus Gardens at about midnight
Saturday. They turned a spotlight
on the car and began shouting in
abusive language.
As the student started to drive
away they broke a window of his
car with a beer bottle. They then
followed the car to a women's dor
mitory where they created another
disturbance before they left.
They then returned to the Cactus
Gardens and at about 2 a.m. went
through a similar routine. This time
they taunted the couple and told the
man to get out and fight.
As he started to get out the door
was slammed in his face and he was
cut about the forehead. He drove
back to the campus and notified the
campus police.
Officers Carl Geilitz and Don
Norton picked up the group as they
were starting on a third car near
the stadium. This couple escaped
without injury or damage.
Chief Gordon Davis said the
youths called themselves "self
styled mugger busters." All four
are Palo Alto High School seniors.
Davis identified them as:
Charles L. York, 19; Ernest L.
Ahrens, 18; Earl D. Hill, 18; and
William D. Lucas Jr., 18.
