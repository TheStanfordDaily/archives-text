### 
This is the most difficult letter I have ever had to write. In leav
ing Stanford, 1 am leaving one of the greatest universities in the
United States and the finest student body in the world. 1 cannot
begin to tell you how much, during these three years, I have
valued your help and your friendship. We have had some tough
ones, and we have always solved them together. I know that you
will give my successor the same wonderful loyalty and co-opera
tion that you have given me, and my one word of advice to him
vAll be that he always play it absolutely straight with you.
Thank you for all the kindnesses you have done me. I shall
never forget you.
