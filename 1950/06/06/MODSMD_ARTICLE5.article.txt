# Open Letter to Dean Kimpton
## 
### 
(EDITORIAL)
You were not stepping into an easy job when you came here
as Dean of Students in 1947. At that time the Dean's office was
a hot spot. Since 1945, when the post was established, no other
University administrative job had been under more fire from the
students.
You inherited the task of bridging the gap between students
and administration, and the gap was in many respects wide.
A Dean of Students, as you pointed out in one of your Alumni
Review "Chats," is a "sort of catch-all guy to be in charge of
everything that concerns students outside the classroom. The job
by definition is, of course, impossible. Nobody can remain sane
and be in charge of (all this)."
But in your three years here you did the "impossible" job. You
won the confidence, respect, and admiration of Stanford people,
and bridged the gaps that had been perhaps perilously wide.
To us, the students, you became known as a "swell guy." We
learned that we could bring our problems to you and receive
frankness and understanding. And we learned that we could al
ways "open up" and really talk things over with you, and that
when we asked you a question we got a straight answer.
Sometimes you said, "Well, this is a tough one. Let's kick it
around a bit and see what happens." We always knew that the
right solution would "happen."
You solved countless problems, no two of them alike. Your
attitude toward student government, your confidence in our abil
ity to handle our own responsibilities, will long be remembered.
Your leaving marks a great loss to Stanford . . . students, ad
ministration, and alumni alike.
We consider ourselves tremendously fortunate to have had
you with us for these few years, and we extend our most sincere
congratulations to you on your new position at the University of
Chicago, with all our good wishes for the future.
We assure you that we will extend to your successor the same
loyalty and co-operation which we have always sought to give
you. A loyalty and co-operation that you have richly deserved.
