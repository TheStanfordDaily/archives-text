moderator in student - administra

ment expressed by Atheltic Director
A 1 Masters when he heard the news.
The coaches said they felt the same
way.
Dean Kimpton, who went out for
frosh football himself in the days of
"Pop" Warner, has helped the cause
of the athlete no end as Stanford's
PCC representative. It was he who
successfully argued for another year
of eligibility for athletes such as
Gay Bryan and Lew Davis.
In the administration of his office,
he has built up the staffs in the of
fices of the Chief Counselors for
Men and Women. Miss Adele Stro
