# U.S. State Dept. Files Not Rifled Says FBI
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 21 (UP)—An FBI check has disproved
charges by Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R., Wis., that the State De
partment rilled its loyalty files before turning them over to Senate
Communist investigators, Chairman Millard E. Tydings, D., Md.,
said today.
At the same time, Tydings set a Sunday night deadline for mem-

bers of his Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee to complete their
first-hand examination of the loy
alty files on 81 State Department
employees branded as pro-Commu
nists by McCarthy.
The investigating group has had
access to the files, in the White
House cabinet room, for several
weeks. But McCarthy has protested
repeatedly that they are worthless
for checking his charges because the
department "raped" the files by re
moving damaging material.
Tydings' blunt announcement that
McCarthy's complaint "is not sub
stantiated by the facts" came after
the subcommittee had questioned
State Department Security Chief
John E. Peurifoy behind closed
doors on another McCarthy allega
tion.
McCarthy has asserted that Peu
rifoy offered legal help and a gov
ernment loyalty clearance as a
"payoff" to Emmanuel S. Larsen for
favorable testimony in connection
with the 1945 Amerasia stolen se
crets case.
Meantime, the Senate Judiciary
Committee postponed action on a
Republican resolution calling for an
independent "blame - fixing" inves
tigation of the Amerasia affair until
after the Tydings group completes
its inquiry.
Sen. James O. Eastland, D„ Miss.,
said the request, which was backed
by 21 GOP senators, has been re
ferred to a Judiciary subcommittee
with instructions to take action only
if the Tydings subcommittee reports
its check has not been "thorough
and complete."
"I do not believe we should go
into this if the Foreign Relations
subcommittee does a complete and
thorough job," Eastland said.
