# The 						Changing Scene

Something new has been added to the campus today as Stan
ford gets ready to receive approximately 2,900 students for the
summer quarter. Gone are the wild fraternity parties, the college
pranks, and the "ivory tower" feeling that permeates the campus
three-quarters of the year.
Summer at Stanford sees a more mature type of student—a stu
dent that has already seen something of the outside world and
one who knows what he is after. Teachers, professional men, ex
ecutives, and many others go to make up the student body. They
are not completely unaware of the lighter side of college life, but
they know that the outside world is not one party after another;
they have come to Sianford to expand, renew, and fill their in
tellectual apparatus.
Among these older students will be scattered a number of
entering freshmen, accelerated students, and some students who
are just here for a vacation. The younger students will be up
against fierce competition and they v/ill find that they will really
have to work for just passing grades.
But the important thing for them to remember is that, besides
hard work, summer offers a real chance to meet and get to know
these men from the outside world—the educators and business
men who have already experienced life and who can give the col
lege student a lot of valuable advice.
This quarter, as during no other quarter at Stanford, there are
unlimited opportunities for the wide-awake student. Summer
comes but once a year at Stanford—take advantage of it—you
may not be back to experience another.
