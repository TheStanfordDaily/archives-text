# Daily Worker Manager Faces Contempt Charge

### 
WASHINGTON, June 21 (UP) —
Philip Bart, general manager of the
Communist Daily Worker, refused
to answer questions for the House
Un-American Activities Committee
today and promptly was threatened
with prosecution for contempt of
Congress.
He appeared at a stormy hearing
into the operations of an alleged
Communist - operated fake passport
l ing. Marcel Scherer, former West
Coast labor organizer and now asso
ciated with the United Furniture
Workers' Union, also was called to
testily.
In a previous investigation, the
committee charged the passport
ring supplied visas for such top
Communists as Earl Browder and
Gerhart Eisler.
Scherer joined Bart in his refusal
to discuss the ring, however, after
being advised by his attorney.
Emanuel Bloch, that he had a legal
right to ignore "self-incriminatory"
questions.
The committee then produced a
photostatic copy of a passport
which, investigators said, indicated
that Scherer made a trip to Moscow
in 1934 to learn "Russian revolu
tionary tactics" while ostensibly
visiting France, England, and Ger
many,
The witness refused to identify
the signature on the passport as
his or to say whether he ever went
abroad.

On the advice of counsel, Bart
refused to answer committee ques
tions on the ground that his answers
"might be used to incriminate me."
His hearing broke up in a furore of
shouts and arm waving, with Bart
informing Acting Chairman Francis
Walter, D„ Pa., that he would "not
be a party to violating the consttu
tion."
Walter retorted, "If you have a>
much regard for the constitution,
behind which you are hiding, you
would be willing to help this com
mittee find out what American
have been going to Russia for train
ing in subversive activities."
Asked whether Bart will be cited
for contempt. Walter said he saw no
reason "why we shouldn't proceed
against him on a charge of con
tempt."
