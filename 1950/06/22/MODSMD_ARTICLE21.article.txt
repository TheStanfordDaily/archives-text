# U.S. Charges Romania On Hutsinpiller Ousting

WASHINGTON, June 21 (UP) â€” -
The State Department disclosed to
day that Communist Romania has
expelled* Capt. Herschel Hutsinpil
ler, assistant U.S. military attache
in Bucharest, on "distorted" charges
of plotting to arm revolutionary
forces.
In a sharp note to the Romanian
foreign office, the department said
the expulsion was part ol' "a delib
erate and centrally directed" cam
paign of Communist countries to
drive American diplomatic repre
sentatives from Eastern Europe.
It was the closest the department
has yet come to charging formally
that Russia is instigating the cam
paign by Red satellite countries to
harass U.S. diplomats.
Department spokesman Michael J.
McDermott declined to answer
questions about possible retaliatory
moves against Romania. But the
note indicated that the two nations
are edging toward a complete rup
ture in diplomatic relations.
While emphasizing that no such
drastic step yet has been decided
upon, officials made no secret of
their concern over the general sit
uation.
Romania previously had imposed
tight restrictions on American offi
cials in Bucharest. The State De
partment retaliated last month by
ordering Romanian diplomats re
stricted to an area 35 miles around
Washington.
Communist Bulgaria carried its
harassment of U.S. officials so far
that this country broke off diplo
matic relations last spring.
Relations with Hungary also have
been severely strained, particularly
over the imprisonment of American
business man Robert A. Vogeler.
Negotiations for his "ransom" are
under way.
The department said Romania de
clared Hutsinpiller persona non
grata on charges that he possessed
small arms ammunition which he
planned to supply to anti-Commu
ist underground fighters.
While announcing its intention to
recall Hutsinpiller at once, the de
partment bluntly rejected the accu
sations.
