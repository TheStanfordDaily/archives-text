### 
PARIS. June 21 (UP) —Fiance
may follow up its Schuman Plan
for pooling Western Europe's coal
and steel production with a new
proposal to combine agricultural
resources, it was reported tonight.
This development came as Jean
Monnet, France's top economic
planner, proposed that a six-nation
"watchdog" parliament be set up
to supervise the operation of the
heavy industry pool.
Monnet. author of the pooling
plan advanced by Foreign Minister
Robert Schuman, made the parlia
ment suggestion in a two - hour
speech to delegates of six Western
European nations meeting here to
discuss combining their coal and
steel resources.
He said members, picked from the
parliaments of the participating
countries, should meet annually to
furnish a "democratic" over-all su
pervision of the pool's operations.
Pooling of agricultural resources
was suggested by French farm lead
ers. It was learned reliably that
France will propose this and the
pooling of other basic resources if
the Schuman Plan succeeds.
The French government Was un
derstood to be examining the agri
cultural idea favorably. However,
government sources said that no ac
tion, aside from a preliminary gen

eral examination, will be taken on
any other pool projects before the
Schuman Plan becomes effective.
Monnet told the delegates from
Italy, West Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, and
France that a supra-national high
authority which would be set up to
manage the coal-steel pool might be
called on to l'eport to the six-nation
parliament.
The French cabinet earlier ap

proved the text of a draft treaty to
set up the high authority. It is ex
pected to be submitted to the con
ference as a working text at the
end of this week.
Meanwhile there were indications
that France, already in disagree
ment with Britain over the Schu
man plan, may meet new opposition
from some of the other participat
ing countries.
