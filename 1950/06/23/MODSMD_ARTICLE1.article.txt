# Acheson Sees New Era of World Peace
## 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 22
(UP) â€”Secretary of State Dean
Acheson said today the West is
on "the threshold of a new pe
riod" in a successful drive to
prevent a third world war.
But lie asserted that until the
Russians adopt a "live and let live"
policy, no dramatic peace moves or
"Trojan doves from the Communist
movement" can end the cold war.
Acheson's appearance before the
Harvard alumni was marred by the
picketing of a 40 - person "peace"
group headed by Rev. Robert H.
Muir of Roxbury, assistant rector of
St. John's Episcopal Church.
The keynote of Acheson's speech
was "war is not inevitable." He
pounded it home by declaring, "This
cannot be said too often."
"It is the determined purpose of
this country, and of the like-minded
nations worknig with us, to prevent
war." Acheson said.
"We are building our strength in
order that we may eliminate the
conditions which could give rise to
war, and we are on the threshold of
a new period in the successful for
ward movement of this effort. We
face this new period with confi
dence, but we must be very clear in
our minds about our purposes in
the times that lie ahead."
The picketers marched outside
the Harvard Yard where the color
ful commencement exercises were
in progress. They carried banners
reading "Acheson, let Trygve Lie
speak," "Acheson, peace not
bombs." "Acheson, end war talks."
They also distributed leaflets to
Harvard graduates and alumni, say
ing "Why honor Secretary Ache
son? What has he accomplished as
Secretary of State to deserve your
honor and applause? Has he ad
vanced the cause of peace?"
The Secretary did not outline in
detail the "new period" to which he
referred. But he held out hope that
Russia will eventually be ready to
settle her differences with the West.
"As the leaders of the Soviet Un
ion come to appreciate that their
analysis of the world situation, and
their policies flowing from that
analysis, have been incorrect, the
possibility for reasonable settle
ments of matters affecting the sta
bility and progress of the interna
tional community will increase," he
said.
But he warned:
' Until the Soviet leaders do gen
uinely accept a 'live and let live'
philosophy, then no approach from
the free world, however imagina
tive, and no Trojan dove from the
Communist movement, will help to
resolve our mutual problems."
