A newspaper of the students, by the students, and for the stu
dents—this is our objective for the summer.
We want to publish a good paper—a paper that keeps you up
to date on world as well as campus activities. To do this, we need
your help in the form of:
1. Intelligent suggestions —good or bad, we don't care, but we
have to have some idea how you feel on our policy, coverage, and
news choice.
2. Letters to the editor—a good paper thrives on active reader
participation, and these letters are one way you can take part in
the paper.
3. Co-operation with publicity—remember that there are almost
3,000 students here this summer and all news items have to be
judged in relation to the number of students they affect.
4. Most important of all, your help in supplying us with real
news. With our limited staff, many interesting items are apt to
escape our eyes, unless you, the reader, tell us about them.
This is not a paper by a few individuals—it is the organ of the
students of Stanford University. Its success depends as much
upon the support of the students and professors as upon the edi
tors and managers. We will do our best—the rest is up to you!
