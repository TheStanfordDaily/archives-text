# Dimes, Dollars & Crew

### 
Yesterday's San Francisco Chronicle printed a somewhat ex
cellent editorial on the achievements of Stanford's hard-working,
third-place-in-the-Marietta, Cinderella crew. The Chronicle edito
rial went on to suggest that the athletic department get busy and
support this worthy organization with dollars for training table,
shells, oars, trips, and coaches.
On the surface, the commendable showing of the oarsmen in
Ohio certainly seems to indicate the desirability of this.
But unfortunately for the crew—and the University—the prob
lem isn't solvable by a mere nod from one of the BAC big-wigs.
As Athletic Director A 1 Masters put it,"The crew's winning or
losing at Marietta didn't change the picture for the BAC at all.
We simply don't have the funds available to give any support to
the crewmen without seriously curtailing our present athletic set
up. I am opposed to cutting out entirely any of our established
sports or eliminating junior varsity sports in order to support the
crew. And furthermore, the athletic plant needs a great deal of
repair work done on it."
The Daily, if the disposition of funds is such, tends to stand by
Masters on this issue.
The crew, as it is now, receives University recognition in that
they receive Circle "S" letters for their efforts. They do not re
ceive any money to keep them going.
The Chronicle's training table suggestion is, of course, ridicu
lous considering the fact that crew is a minor sport. Four of Stan
ford's major sports —baseball, swimming, golf, and tennis —do not
regularly do any eating at University expense.
It is granted that the crew should get some financial aid. Ac
cording to one budget they could get along on 58,000 a year. This
is a reasonable amount, but the top forces in the BAC are inclined
to wonder just how long they would be satisfied —after the present
strong-hearted bunch leave —with this piddling amount. Califor
nia, with which the University-supported crews of the future will
compete on even terms, spends about $45,000 annually on the
boat sport.
So the questions that have once more leaped up due to the
crew's splendid Marietta showing are: Does the crew deserve
University financial backing? And, is it possible for the BAC,
under present conditions, to support them? The answer to the
first question is a definite yes. To the second, the man in the best
position to know, A 1 Masters, says no.
The best thing for the crew supporters to do now is to seek out
some source of revenue for the support of the crew: a rich and
dying alumnus or oil under the boat house.
Or maybe the ASSU would like to increase their donation to the
athletic department with the specification that it be used for crew
expenses.—A. B.
