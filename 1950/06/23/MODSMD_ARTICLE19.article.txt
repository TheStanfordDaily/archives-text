# MAJOR LEAGUE BAESBALL ROUNDUP:
## Giants Murder Cards; Bums Tag Reds; Phils Over Pirates; Sox Blast Boston 
### 
NEW YORK. June 22 (UP)—The
New York Giants with Dave Koslo
and Larry Jansen wielding white
wash brushes sent the St. Louis
Cardinals x - eeling out of first place
today with a doubleheader blank
ing, 3 to 0 and 5 to 0, at the Polo
Grounds.
It was the first time since 1932
that any team had held the mighty
Redbirds runless in both ends of a
twin bill.
In so doing, the Giants lent a
helping hand to their long-time ri
vals from Brooklyn, the Dodgers,
who backed into a half-game lead
in the National League despite tak
ing a 9 to 5 beating from their arch
nemesis, the Cincinnati Reds.
Jansen's right-handed slants per
mitted St. Louis only six hits in the
opener. It was his third straight I
shutout and ran his runless string j
of innings to 29. The Giants' three
runs against Howie Pollet were all
on homers — a two - run blast by
Tookie Gilbert and a singleton by
A 1 Dark.
Lefty Koslo was even sharper ;
than Jansen, giving up only two
singles. Hank Thomson's single
scored a Giant run in the fourth and
the New Yorkers wrapped things up
with four runs in a riotous seventh
inning highlighted by Bob Thom
son's triple and Henry Thomson's
steal of home. A 1 Brazle was the
loser.
Ted Kluszewski whacked a homer
and a single, driving in five runs, to
lead the Reds in their win at Brook
lyn, which cost the Dodgers their j
first series at home this season.
The Philadelphia Phils moved
past the Cards into second place,
just a half-game behind the Dodg
ers, by beating Pittsburgh, 7 to 4.

: Rookie Bob Miller scored his sixth
straight win as his mates pulled a !
triple play and hit four homers.
Boston and Chicago were not
scheduled in the National League.
In American League day games, !
Washington beat Detroit. 5 to 2;
Cleveland downed >Jew York. 6 to
2, and Chicago beat Boston, 4 to 2.
Washington's victory gave them a
three-game series sweep over the
league-leading Tigers.
The Indians beat the Yanks with
five homers — two each by Luke
Easter and Jim Hegan and one by
Ray Boone. The Yanks hit two—by '
Johnny Mize and Joe DiMaggio.
Ex - Senators Ray Scarborough
and Ed Robinson led the White Sox
to their win over Boston, which was
skippered by Steve O'Neill due to
the illness of Joe McCarthy.
