L.A. TRANSIT STRIKE ENDS â€” Roistering Shriners, currently
holding their national convention in Los Angeles, crowd one
of the city's first Los Angeles Transit Lines' streetcars that went
back into service following the settling of the six-day transit
workers' strike. The group having fun is the A 1 Bahr Temple
from San Diego.
