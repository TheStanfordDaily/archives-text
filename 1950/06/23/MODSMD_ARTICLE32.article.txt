# Solons Give Draft 15-Day Stay; Rush Action on Permanent Bill

### 
WASHINGTON, June 22 (UP)—
The Senate voted today to extend
the draft law for three years with
the proviso that President Truman
can order inductions only if an
emergency arises while Congress is
not in session.
The compromise bill was passed
! by voice vote after both the Senate
j and the House had rushed through
a stop-gap resolution to keep the
present Selective Service Act alive
for 15 more days. It is scheduled
; to expire at .midnight tomorrow.
The House had previously voted
to maintain draft machinery for two
\ years on a stand-by basis, which
! would have given Congress sole au
j thority to order actual inductions.
Both bills require registration and
classification of men 18 through 25.
A Senate-House conference com

mittee must iron out the differences
between the two bills within the 15-
day grace period provided by the
temporary extension.
President Truman has asked for
a straight three-year renewal of the
present law with no strings on his
right to order inductions — a plea
that was strongly backed by top
military leaders.
