### DAVID WONG 
Twenty-seven persons were sent
to the Palo Alto and Community
Hospitals after a section of plaster
approximately 80 by 30 feet crashed
on top of patrons of the Sequoia
Theater, Redwood City, at 11:30
Wednesday night.
An estimated 250 to 300 patrons
were in the theater at the time.
About 100 were seated in the logo
section. After the collapse of the
plaster from the ceiling, there was
general turmoil, and several per
sons had to be dragged from the de
bris by theater aides and patrons.
Another section of plaster, about
half the size of the original one, fell
on the loge section and parts of the
main floor during the investigation
which followed yesterday morning.
According to the Palo Alto Times,
Harry Seipel, district manager for
Fox West Coast Theaters, threat
ened to throw out a newspaperman
who witnessed the plaster fall yes
terday morning, if he printed any
thing about the plaster falling.
Three Daily reporters were barred
from the building Wednesday night.
Fire Marshal Richard Drivon de
clared that preliminary investiga
tion showed that the plaster had
been pulling away for some time,
and that vibration, plus the weight
of the plaster itself with the short
nails, probably caused the plaster to
pull away from the laths.
Seats on which the plaster fell
were considerably damaged, but no
estimate of the cost has yet been
mzide,
