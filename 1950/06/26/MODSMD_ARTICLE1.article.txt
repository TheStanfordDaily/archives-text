Bulletin
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 25 (UP) —All military personnel
attached to Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Field here were or
dered back to their posts today following the invasion of South
Korea.
No official announcement was made, but both posts apparently
were alerted.
The Air Force asked radio stations to broadcast messages ask
ing all fighter pilots to report to Elmendorf Field at once. Military
police passed through the city stopping every soldier and asking
him to return to Fort Ricnardoon.
Military officials also used public address systems in theaters
and the baseball park to call soldiers and airmen back to their
posts.

SEOUL. Korea, Monday, June 26
(UP) — Counter-attacking South
Korean troops have checked the in
vading Northern Communists on
most parts of the front, and the tiny
republican air force has gone into
action against the Red attackers.
The White House said late last
night that there would be no fur
ther news on the Korean situation
until this morning.
A dispatch from Tokyo said Gen.
eral Douglas Mac-Arthur has started
flying military supplies to the em
battled South Korean forces, pre
sumably taking off from southern
Japanese airfields.
Air Force informants said that
arms-carrying planes would be pro
tected by United States fighter
planes, presumably the latest jet
types.
At the same time it was reliably
reported that the U.S. Navy has
dispatched an undisclosed number
of destroyers from Japan to escort
ships evacuating women and chil
dren from Korea.
Lights burned throughout the
night in Mac Arthur's headquarters
as chiefs of his staff studied devel
opments in the Korean explosion.
Four transport planes stood by at
Haneda Airport awaiting orders to
send the first lot of arms to the
South Korean forces.
In Tokyo, meanwhile, John Fos
ter Dulles, special State Department
adviser, scheduled a series of talks
today with General Mac Arthur and
other leaders on the Korean war
situation, following up an urgent
conference he had with Mac Arthur
last night.
The bad news from the front was

as follows:
The Communists have captured
Kaesong, 40 miles northwest of
Seoul, and most of Chunchon. 50
miles northeast of Seoul.
The North Koreans were using
tanks, ships, and planes of Russian.
type. Northern planes, of Russian
Yak fighter type, strafed Seoul's
Kimpo Airport yesterday. They set
fire to oil and gasoline stocks and
riddled a United States Air Force
C-54 transport plane which had ar
rived from Tokyo.
Along the Imjim River, at a point
30-odd miles northwest of Seoul,
reliable advices said the Commu
nists had taken the railroad bridge
and crossed the river. South Ko
rean army sources here said that
the bridgehead had been contained
on the south side.
Two companies of picked South
Korean troops drove across the Red
frontier to capture the manufactur
ing town of Haeju, just north of the
line. The republican troops cap
tured quantities of equipment, in
cluding 16 trucks and about 100
light machine guns.
The most heartening news, how
ever, was that the republican forces
were making an excellent showing
in the Ongjin Peninsula, which mil
itary observers had virtually writ
ten off as lost.
The little Soutfy Korean navy re
ported setting fire to and sinking an
enemy warship off the east coast
and said it was engaging eight oth
ers.
Various front advices said the
South Korean forces had destroyed
about 20 enemy tanks in the Ui
jongbu sector north of Seoul, where
the Communists, are about 25 miles
—their farthest advance—from the
capital.
