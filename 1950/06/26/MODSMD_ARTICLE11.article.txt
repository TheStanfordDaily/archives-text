# Card Spikers Lead Olympic Club in AAU Triumph; Attlesey Sets World Record
## 
### 
San Francisco's Flying "O" Olympic Club, led by five Stanford
thinclads, copped the AAU track meet at College Park, Maryland,
Saturday, 79 3 5 over the New York Athletic Club's 79 points. But
the team win- -as always—took the second-place nod to the colors
of the University of Southern California.
Troy land's great Dick Attlesey, who nabbed an as yet uncon-

firmed world's record in the high
hurdles in the Fresno Relays, again
blasted the tall stick mark with a
blazing : 13.6 in the 110-meter ob
stacle course. Attlesey thus clipped
one-tenth of a second off the pre
vious world mark of :13.7, set by

Forrest Towns in 1936 and matched
by Fred Wolhcott in 1941.
This latest Attlesey performance
will probably go a long way toward
cinching confirmation of the 120-
yard mark that the Trojan set at
Fresno.
One of the two S.F. Olympic Club
first places was nabbed by one Gay
lord Deane Bryan, Stanford's iron
man, who — atlhough dethroned as
AAU broad jump champ—beat his
nearest competitor in the hop-skip
and-jump by a good nine inches.
Brother Bobby Bryan held up the
family name by nabbing a second in
the 200-meter low hurdles, placing
behind Bill Flaming of Notre Dame.
Big. blond Otis Chandler once
moi'e —as expected — settled for a
second in the shot put behind Yale's
remarkable Jim Fuchs. Fuchs

heaved the iron ball a splendid 57
ft. 2Vh in. toward infinity, while the
Stanfordite mustered a 54 ft. 11%
in. for second place.
Bud Held, who had arm trouble
all season but who won his third
straight national championship ear
ly this month at the NC2A meet,
had to settle for an unimpressive
fourth place in the javelin as Steve
Seymour, of the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club, sent the spear 228 ft. 10%
in. for the win. Cal's George Ro
seme, competing for the Flying "O,"
was third with 213 ft. 11% in. Held
was less than an inch and a half be
hind Roseme.
Summer quarter A36U President
Downing McKee, who used his last
intercollegiate eligibility in 1949 and
who has since competed for Dink
Templeton's S.F.ers, took fourth in
the high sticks. McKee finished be
hind world - beater Attlesey, Penn
State's Gehrdes, and Fleming of the
Irish.
