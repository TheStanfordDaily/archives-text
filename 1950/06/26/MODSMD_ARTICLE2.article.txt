# Editors Told Psychological Offense Need
## 
### 
The time has come to take the
psychological offensive in the con
flict with Russia, Assistant Secre
tary of State Edward W. Barrett
said Saturday night.
Barrett, chief of the Voice of
America, spoke before a conference
ot California editors here at Stan
ford.
"It is not enough today just to
have ourselves and our aspirations
understood," he said. "Through the
Voice of America we have done a
good, modest public relations job
abroad, but this is not enough."
He outlined four ways by which
America could take the psychologi
cal offensive.
1. Establish a healthy interna
tional community.
2. Present America fairly, coun
tering" all the misconceptions and
misrepresentations about us.
3. Deter the Soviets from fur
ther encroachments. In other
words, frustrate their psychological
preparations for war by proving to
the Soviet and satellite peoples that
we are friendly toward them.
4. Roll back Soviet power. Make
the captive peoples feel that they
still belong with us and that we
want them.
On Friday, Judge Leon R. Yank
wich told the editors that whatever
rights they enjoy as editors come to
them, not by reason of the profes
sion, but as individuals and private
citizens.
Judge Yankwich, of the U.S. Dis
trict Court in Los Angeles, is au
thor of the recent book, "It's Libel
or Contempt if You Print It."
The judge spoke of a definite en
largement of two parts of the law
of libel:
The first is a broadening of the
definition of libel so as to consider
libelous statements which formerly
would not have been considered
such. This goes along with the tend
ency to broaden the scope of public
criticism.
Second is the right of fair com
ment. "which stems from the famil
iar principle that any matter of
public concern is a proper subject
for dissemination and comment.
