### United Press 
President Truman returned in
haste from Independence, Mo., last
night for conferences with his top
cabinet officers on the world crisis
provoked by Communist North Ko
rea's invasion of U.S. - sponsored
South Korea.
He broke his weekend rest at the
summer White House after Secre
tary of State Dean Acheson tele
phoned the grim news that the
East-West cold war had exploded
into a shooting war on one of its
far-flung fronts.
Even before his special plane
landed at National Airport at 7:20
p.m., EDT., the President had ar
ranged to meet immediately after
his arrival with Acheson and De
fense Secretary Louis Johnson.
On boarding the plane at Kansas
City, he told reporters the Korean
war "could be a dangerous situa
tion, but I hope it is not."
These fast - moving developments
came as Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur,
acting on top - level orders from
Washington, rushed American arms
to South Korea via fighter-escorted
U.S. transport plane>

The type and quantity of weapons
was not disclosed.
Meanwhile, the United States
called the United Nations Security
Council into emergency session yes
terday afternoon, denouncing North
Korean attacks across the frontier
as "a breach of the peace and an
act of aggression." The United
States demanded a UN ultimatum
to the Communists to stop attacking
and withdraw to their side of the
38th parallel latitude which forms
the border.
The Security Council approved
the American - sponsored resolution
with Yugoslavia abstaining. Russia
boycotted the meeting. The Rus
sians refuse to attend meetings be
cause the Chinese Nationalists in
stead of the Chinese Communists
are still recognized as the legitimate
government and hence occupy Chi
na's UN seat.
Radio Moscow today broadcast a
communique by the interior min
istry of North Korea which claimed
that forces of the Soviet-sponsored
regime had penetrated more than
six miles into territory of the re
public of South Korea

The communique, second from
North Korea, said North Korean
troops had crossed the border at
"many places."
'"Fighting is continuing," the com
munique said, as relayed by Tass
from Pyong Yang, capital of the
North Korean government.
In its first mention of the Korean
situation, Radio Moscow broadcast
first the original communique to be
issued by the Red Korean interior
ministry. The communique accused
the South Koreans of starting the
fighting.
The first North Korean communi
que charged that the "puppet na
tional defense army of South Korea
launched a surprise attack along the
entire front of the 38th parallel
against North Korea."
It said enemy troops penetrated
up to IV4 miles into North Korea
from three places and that North
Korean troops were ordered to fight
a defensive battle.
The communique said that the
South Korean government must
"bear the whole responsibility for
all serious consequences that arise
from this adventurous attack "
