It seems to us that the whole issue in the Cai loyalty oath has
been completely smothered by a wave of sensationalism, warped
publicity, and general confusion. There are a couple of miscon
ceptions that should be straightened out.
To start with, there is nothing legally wrong with the loyalty
oath. The University of California is as much an employer as the
telephone company, and it has just as much right to reguire its
employees to sign a loyalty oath. UC doesn't have to hire any
body it doesn't want, and it can fire professors it feels are not
doing their job.
And secondly, the loyalty oath as it now stands won't stifle aca
demic freedom as such at Cal. There is nothing in the oath that
says a man cannot teach Communism, the ideas of Karl Marx, or
the present government in Soviet Russia.
No, the issue is much more basic—it lies in the whole concept
of teaching in an atmosphere of trust, an atmosphere of freedom
of inquiry, and an atmosphere congenial to the pursuit of truth.
What is happening at Cal is the same thing that is happening in
the State Department. McCarthy's charges are making the gov
ernment so jittery that they don't know whom to trust. The gov
ernmental officials don't dare open their mouths for fear they will
incriminate themselves, and, even worse, the American public
feels very uncertain about the ability and sincerity of our elected
representativs.
The row at Cal over the loyalty oath has exactly the same effect.
The old atmosphere of intellectual integrity seems to have dis
appeared at UC; a general feeling of tension and suspicion has
taken its place. Professors question each other's honesty and
blast their president openly in the press and in forums. Presi
dent Hutchins of Chicago University has questioned the fortitude
and qualifications of Dr. Sproul to serve as a college president.
Students begin to lose track of the main purpose of college and
look at their professors in a new light—that of public figures on
trial.
This atmosphere is not conducive to higher education or to in
tellectual leadership. The loyalty oath has already done more
damage to teaching at Cal than the non-expulsion of the Commu
nists would. And, we should remember that only the most fanati
cal liberals would openly admit they were Communists — the
more dangerous would continue to teach under the guise of semi
leftist.
President Sproul and the Board of Regents would be much bet
ter off if they would swallow their pride and drop the whole issue.

dent Hutchins of Chicago University has questioned the fortitude
and qualifications of Dr. Sproul to serve as a college president.
Students begin to lose track of the main purpose of college and
look at their professors in a new light—that of public figures on
trial.
This atmosphere is not conducive to higher education or to in
tellectual leadership. The loyalty oath has already done more
damage to teaching at Cal than the non-expulsion of the Commu
nists would. And, we should remember that only the most fanati
cal liberals would openly admit they were Communists — the
more dangerous would continue to teach under the guise of semi
leftist.
President Sproul and the Board of Regents would be much bet
ter off if they would swallow their pride and drop the whole issue.
