# United Nations Not a Failure, Says Romulo
## 
### 
In only five years of operation,
the United Nations has accom
plished near miracles in its at
tempt to create a peaceful, uni
fied world, General Carlos P. Ro
mulo, president of the United
Nations General Asembly, de
clared in a speech at the Memo
rial Auditorium yesterday.
The 49-year-old Philippines edi
tor, author, soldier, and diplomat
was introduced by Dean Douglas M.
YVhitaker to an auditorium packed
to overflowing.
General Romulo told the audi
ence that the United Nations has
had its failures, but its failures
could not cancel the constructive
work which it has done in its five
year history.
''Anyone reading the newspaper
headlines will think that the UN is
on its way out. That is not the fault
of the newspapers. The really con
structive work seldom gets the
headlines â€” the work behind the
scenes, the work that builds. That
is the work that counts in the
building of one world."
The short and energetic speaker
then told of the UN's silent and un
dramatized work in the fields of
health, child welfare, labor, passport
regulations, and education. But
such work, unlike a walkout at the
UN. could not get eight - column
headlines.
Tracing the successes of the
United Nations in preserving the
peace of the world, General Romulo
pointed to Iran, where "certain for
eign troops acted in direct violation
of agreements and refused to
budge from Iran territory. But the
Security Council acted, the foreign
troops got out, and a war was
averted.
He then ponited to the UN's suc
cesses in Greece, in Israel, in Indo
nesia, and in Kashmir.
"These successes have not been
dramatized as the failures have
been. But they are in the records
for all to see. Visualize the world if
we did not have the United Na
tions."
Touching on the Korean situation.
General Romulo said that within
24 hours of an act of aggression, the
United Nations had ordered a
cease-fire. The orders may be ig
nored and not respected, but the
conscience of the world has spoken.
Whoever dares to defy the orders
does so at his own peril.
In asking for support for the UN,
the general said, "It is our one and
only hope for peace. It represents
the spiritual power, which is the
greatest power in the world."
