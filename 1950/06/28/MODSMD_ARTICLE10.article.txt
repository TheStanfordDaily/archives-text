# House Passes One Year Draft Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. June 27 (UP)—
The House, spurred by the Korean
crisis, overwhelmingly approved a
one-year extension of the present I
draft law today but similar action J
was blocked in the Senate until to-
morrow.
The House voted 315 to 4 in favor j
of a compromise agreed to by Sen- !
ate-House conferees in less than an
hour. In addition to continuing the
present draft law until July 9, 1951,
it gives President Truman new |
power to mobilize the reserves and j
National Guard.
Senate Democratic Leader Scott
W. Lucas, 111., sought immediate 1
Senate action to send the bill to the
White House but was headed off i
by Sen. James P. Kem, R., Mo., who
objected to giving the President
power to induct youths when Con
gress is not in session.
The Senate then agreed instead to
vote on the compromise at 2 p.m.,
EDT, tomorrow.
Passage by a wide margin seemed
assured.
The compromise does not give Mr.
Truman the three-year extension of
the existing law he sought. But it
removes restrictions on his power
to induct men which both houses
voted.
In addition it arms him with au
thority he did not have previously
to mobilize the reserves and Na
tional Guard. Defense sources said
Congressmen added this on their |
own without any request from the
administration.

his naval forces into the fray with
lightning speed when he received
President Truman's historic order
that the little republic of South Ko
rea should be given the only kind
of aid that could save it.
At dawn today the planes started
roaring across to the Korean battle
front some 350 miles to the north
west.
First to go were the scout planes
to seek enemy targets on the front.
Then went the rocket-laden F-80
jet planes. Behind them went the
C-47 transport plans with the war
materials the South Koreans, out
armed by the Russian - equipped
Northern Communists, so sorely
needed.
Dozens of sleek A-26 attack
bombers took the air to start
striking at tanks while the jets
shot up both tanks and artillery
emplacements.
The transport planes made for the
Suiwon air fieid 20 miles south of
Seoul, because of the uncertain
conditions in the capital.
Men as well as equipment went
in the planes to set up an advanced
operations base at Suiwon.
A liaison group from Mac Arthur's
headquarters went to the advance
base. They will work with the Ko
reans, and send back to Fukuoka
requests for special strikes at en
emy targets.
Weather conditions were bad at
dawn when the scout planes went
out. but the skies cleared hour by
hour.
And so it was that Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur's air and naval forces
went into shooting action today to
aid the South Koreans against the
invading Communists.
A headquarters communique is
sued a bare three hours after
President Truman announced his
aid order said:
1. The Far Eastern Air Force and
naval elements of the Far East
Command are conducting combat
missions south of the 38th parallel
(the north-south frontier) in Korea
in support of the Korean republic.
2. Ammunition and supplies are
being air-lifted and dispatched by
water to South Korea.
3. A small advance echelon of
Mac Arthur's air headquarters has
been established in Korea.
Mac Arthur, who blasted the Jap
anese from New Guinea up through
the Philippines, was in action again,
five vears later.

WASHINGTON. June 27 (UP)—
The House, spurred by the Korean
crisis, overwhelmingly approved a
one-year extension of the present I
draft law today but similar action J
was blocked in the Senate until to-
morrow.
The House voted 315 to 4 in favor j
of a compromise agreed to by Sen- !
ate-House conferees in less than an
hour. In addition to continuing the
present draft law until July 9, 1951,
it gives President Truman new |
power to mobilize the reserves and j
National Guard.
Senate Democratic Leader Scott
W. Lucas, 111., sought immediate 1
Senate action to send the bill to the
White House but was headed off i
by Sen. James P. Kem, R., Mo., who
objected to giving the President
power to induct youths when Con
gress is not in session.
The Senate then agreed instead to
vote on the compromise at 2 p.m.,
EDT, tomorrow.
Passage by a wide margin seemed
assured.
The compromise does not give Mr.
Truman the three-year extension of
the existing law he sought. But it
removes restrictions on his power
to induct men which both houses
voted.
In addition it arms him with au
thority he did not have previously
to mobilize the reserves and Na
tional Guard. Defense sources said
Congressmen added this on their |
own without any request from the
administration.

lightning speed when he received
President Truman's historic order
that the little republic of South Ko
rea should be given the only kind
of aid that could save it.
At dawn today the planes started
roaring across to the Korean battle
front some 350 miles to the north
west.
First to go were the scout planes
to seek enemy targets on the front.
Then went the rocket-laden F-80
jet planes. Behind them went the
C-47 transport plans with the war
materials the South Koreans, out
armed by the Russian - equipped
Northern Communists, so sorely
needed.
Dozens of sleek A-26 attack
bombers took the air to start
striking at tanks while the jets
shot up both tanks and artillery
emplacements.
The transport planes made for the
Suiwon air fieid 20 miles south of
Seoul, because of the uncertain
conditions in the capital.
Men as well as equipment went
in the planes to set up an advanced
operations base at Suiwon.
A liaison group from Mac Arthur's
headquarters went to the advance
base. They will work with the Ko
reans, and send back to Fukuoka
requests for special strikes at en
emy targets.
Weather conditions were bad at
dawn when the scout planes went
out. but the skies cleared hour by
hour.
And so it was that Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur's air and naval forces
went into shooting action today to
aid the South Koreans against the
invading Communists.

President Truman announced his
