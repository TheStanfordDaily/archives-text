## World Police Force 
### 
When the United Nations was set up five years ago, it was the
general feeling that it would fail in time of real war, due to its lack
of a police force to enforce its orders.
Through five major crises, it was able to bluff along and avert a
world catastrophe: Iran, Greece, Palestine, Indonesia, and Berlin.
But last weekend, when the Communist forces of Northern Korea
crossed the border in a full-scale blitz attack, the UN declaration
that this was a violation of the peace was laughed at by the Reds.
What did they care for proclamations? The UN had no force to
back up its statement, and the Communists were well aware of it.
What was the UN going to use to enforce its demands? There
was only one nation that had the power to do this —the United
States—and overnight, America found itself called on by the other
freedom-loving nations to act as a world police force to enforce
the peace and stop unlawful aggression.
Yesterday's proclamation by President Truman to send air and
naval forces to South Korea showed the world that the United
States, after years of isolationism and timidness, had at last recog
nized and agreed to accept its position in the world.
The United Nations can be successful only through the use of a
powerful police force; America is this police force. Now, with the
active and fast-moving aid of American troops, we can look to the
United Nations as an effective organization to maintain peace in
the world today.
