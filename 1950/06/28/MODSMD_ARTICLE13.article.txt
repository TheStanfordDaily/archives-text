WASHINGTON. June 27 (UP) —
President Truman's decision to in
tervene in the Korean war with
U.S. combat planes and ships does
not mean the United States is le
gally at war.
He acted for and within the
framework of the United Nations to
"restore international peace and
harmony" before the conflict can
blow up into an international dis
aster.
But it was a coldly calculated
gamble that may decide the fate of
ihe UN and the world itself—de
pending on what Russia does.
The Soviets, who at least closed
Iheir eyes to the North Korean
Communist attack, if not actually
encouraging it, have three alterna
tives:
I. Do nothing. If Russia takes
this course, the weight of U.S. air

j and seapower almost inevitably will
swing the balance against the in
vaders unless they overrun the pe
ninsula speedily.
2. Give North Korea further in
direct support but no open official
backing. That could mean a repe
| tition of the Spanish civil war in
which Korea would be a testing
j ground for the cold war rivals.
15. Officially support North Korea.
This could lead to a world war and
the possibl destruction of civiliza
i tion.
Some Congressmen questioned
whether Mr. Truman violated the
constitution by taking upon himself
i the power to declare war which,
| under the constitution, belongs to
i Congress.
But a great majority backed his
| right to act through the United Na
! tions.
