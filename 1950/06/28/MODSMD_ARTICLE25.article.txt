NO YOU DON'T—First baseman Tookie Gilbert of the New York Giants reaches desperately for home
plate with his hand but he's tagged out anyway by catcher Del Kice of the St. Louis Cardinals. Gilbert
broke for the place in the seventh inning of the second game last week after Kice fired the ball to second
to bead off Eddie Stanky coming down from first. The ball was whipped back to Kice in time to nip the
sliding Gilbert. The New Yorkers shut out the Kedbirds in both games played at the Polo Grounds,
3-0. 5-0.
