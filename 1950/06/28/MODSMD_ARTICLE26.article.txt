## Harper Surprises: Grabs PGA Finals Over Williams 
### 
COLUMBUS. 0.. June 27 (UP) —
Solemn Chandler Harper, a nerve
less Virginian with a peerless put
ter. moved up among the pro golf
ing immortals today when he blast
ed hacking Henry Williams, Jr., 4
and 3, to win the P.G.A. golf cham
pionship.
Playing steady, if not brilliant,
golf over sun-baked Scioto Country
Club, the 36-year-old Portsmouth,
Va., pro overpowered his rival from
Secane, Pa., to follow in the foot
steps of such champions as Walter
Hagen, Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan,
and Sam Snead.
It was a well-earned triumph for
the swarthy Southerner, who had
knocked off such favorites as Lloyd
Mangrum and Jimmy Demaret in
his march to the finals. He had
wanted this one as a present for his
ailing wife. And the $3,500 prize it
carried almost doubled the earn
ings he had accumulated in nine
previous tournament efforts this
year.
Williams, who received $1,500 for
his runner-up effort, simply was no
opposition lor Harper's precision
play today. The Pennsylvanian
showed finee golf as he eliminated
Dave Douglas and Claude Harmon
en route to the semi - finals — but
then reached the finals on a pass as
ancient Henry Picard bowed to fa
tigue and let Williams up after hav

ing him six down with seven holes
to play.
Williams never regained the
j touch which hud carried him
through the tough six-day grind to
yesterday. He looked like a country
club hacker through the morning
18 holes as he fired an outgoing 41
and a 38 for a seven-over-par 79.
Harper, always just inside, settled
tor a 3S-37—75 for a three-up lead
at the half-way mark.
In the morning round. Williams
had been spraying his drives badly
and he couldn't buy a putt as twice
he missed the cup from three feet
and another time from less than two
feet.
