# Card Mermen Training For Summer Swim Meet
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
The summer swimming season is
just starting, and Stanford swim
mers will be competing nationally
all summer long.
The reason for the continued em
phasis on swimming is that the Na
tional AAU meet is scheduled for
July 22 and 23 in Seattle, and be
sides that meet, there are divisional
AAU meets, including the Far
Western AAU in San Francisco on
July 14, 15, and 16. the Southern
Pacific Association AAU meet this
week in Beverly Hills, the San
Francisco city meet July 4, and the
Los Angeles Examiner meet later in
the summer.
Since swimmers can't swim for
their schools in these meets, various
clubs are using them on their teams.
One of the most powerful of these
clubs is the Peninsula Swim Club,
coached by one Thomas Haynie,
who doubles as Stanford varsity
coach during the school year.
Haynie has as nucleus for his
club Jimmy Jones, Bruce Put
nam. and Bob Thompson. Jones,
who will be breaking world rec
ords before he is out of Stanford,
will be an ineligible sophomore in
the fall. He is best at breaststroke
and freestyle. Putnam, who placed
in three races in the PCC meet as
a soph this year, features back

stroke and freestyle. Thompson
was a freshman last fall, scored
three touchdowns in the Little
Big Game, went to Fullerton JC
winter and spring quarters, and is
coming back this fall. He is a
freestyler.
As for the whereabouts of the
other Cardinal swimmers, Ralph
Sala is in Honolulu, Pete Cole is
swimming for the California Swim
Club, Bob Wvcoff is performing for
the Pasadena AC, Bob Frojen is
swimming and playing water polo
for Whittier, Jim Lee is swimming
for the Olympic Club, and Chuck
Kelly, Bob Kidder, Irwin Johnson,
and Bill Glathe are cavorting for
Haynie's PSC.
