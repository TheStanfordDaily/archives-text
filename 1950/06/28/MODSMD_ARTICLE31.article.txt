# Civil Liberties Union Convenes To Organize Campus Chapter
## 
### 
An organizatoinal meeting to set
up a Stanford chapter of the Amer
ican Civil Liberties Union will be
held tomorrow night at 8 in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club
house. All interested students, fac
ulty members, and employees are
invited.
Ernest Besig, director of the Civil
Liberties Union of Northern Cali
fornia, will explain the history of
the organization and give reasons
for organizing a chapter on the
Stanford campus.
Tomorrow night's meeting is
sponsored by the Stanford Aca
demic Freedom Committee, a small
group organized here last quarter
to investigate facts concerning the
UC loyalty controversy.
Affiliation with the national group
does not tie the Stanford group to
any specific policies or lines of ac
tion. Each chapter of the Union
is completely autonomous in this
regard.
The Union is a national federation
of organizations which discuss
problems of civil liberties and make
recommendations concerning them.
Where they feel constitutional vio
lations have been made they take
such action as the particular group
concerned feels is appropriate.
The national scale organization is
for purposes of exchanging infor
mation and such rather than for
formulating policy or specific rules
of action.
