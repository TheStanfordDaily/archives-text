# Ed Student Wins Prize
## 
### 
An idea developed by a graduate
student in a community relations
course in Stanford's School of Edu
cation paid off yesterday in a prize
from the Louis F. Dow Company of
St. Paul, Minn.
Alfred Olbrycht, the graduate
student, won the prize—the second
award in a national weekly contest
—by suggesting the use of public
relations techniques to solve a
problem at a San Francisco Bay
Area high school.
As a class project, he consulted
with the students, who received the
idea favorably. As a result the
school slogan and school colors will
be used in a campaign next year to
help solve a student relations prob
lem.
