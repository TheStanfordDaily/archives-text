# UN Mandate Backed By American Armed Forces
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 29 (UP)—President Tru
man said today "we are not at war." Instead, he
asserted, U.S. armed forces are merely obeying
a United Nations mandate to drive out "a bunch
of bandits" who have invaded South Korea.

♦ In calmly worded responses to
questions at a war - jittery news
conference, he described U.S. air
and sea attacks on North Korean
Communist forces as a police action
carried out on behalf of the UN.
He refused to say whether U.S.
ground forces may be thrown into
the fighting, and also was mum on
the possibility of using U.S. atomic
bombs.
He met with reporters as the
news which American mothers and
wives have been dreading most
came from the Korean war front:
At least three, and possibly six
Americans have been killed, and 12
are missing in the battle zone.
The first announced casualty was
Pvt. Frederick J. Walsh of Massi
lon. O. His father, Ralph B. Walsh
Sr., was notified by the Army that
his son suffered flesh wounds.
Secretary of State Dean Acheson
charged meantime that the North
Korean attack was a "premeditated
| action" carefully "plotted" for manv
weeks.
Speaking before the American
Newspaper Guild convention, he
gave a step-by-step account of how
the war began, to refute Commu
nist propaganda claims that South
Korean forces invaded North Korea.
Acheson stressed that the United
States acted in support of the Unit
ed Nations. He said that whether
the UN will "survive" the "direct
challenge" of the North Korean at
tack depends entirely on the speed
and vigor free nations display in
supporting its edicts.
Mr. Truman began the news con
ference with an announcement that
he is sending an economic survey
! mission to the Philippines to study
ways to help rebuild the islands'
economy. The mission will be head
ed by former Under Secretary of
the Treasury Daniel W. Bell, now a
Washington, D.C., banker.
The President had previously an
nounced —at the time he ordered
U.S. forces to help defend South
Korea and Formosa—that U.S. mili
tary units in the Philippines would
be strengthened to discourage Com
munist ambitions.
Asked about possible employment
of U.S. ground forces, the President
sidestepped the issue with the firm
' statement that he could not com-
I ment on U.S. military strategy.

' statement that he could not com-
I ment on U.S. military strategy.
WASHINGTON, June 29 (UP)—President Tru
man said today "we are not at war." Instead, he
asserted, U.S. armed forces are merely obeying
a United Nations mandate to drive out "a bunch
of bandits" who have invaded South Korea.

♦ In calmly worded responses to
questions at a war - jittery news
conference, he described U.S. air
and sea attacks on North Korean
Communist forces as a police action
carried out on behalf of the UN.
He refused to say whether U.S.
ground forces may be thrown into
the fighting, and also was mum on
the possibility of using U.S. atomic
bombs.
He met with reporters as the
news which American mothers and
wives have been dreading most
came from the Korean war front:
At least three, and possibly six
Americans have been killed, and 12
are missing in the battle zone.
The first announced casualty was
Pvt. Frederick J. Walsh of Massi
lon. O. His father, Ralph B. Walsh
Sr., was notified by the Army that
his son suffered flesh wounds.
Secretary of State Dean Acheson
charged meantime that the North
Korean attack was a "premeditated
| action" carefully "plotted" for manv
weeks.
Speaking before the American
Newspaper Guild convention, he
gave a step-by-step account of how
the war began, to refute Commu
nist propaganda claims that South
Korean forces invaded North Korea.
Acheson stressed that the United
States acted in support of the Unit
ed Nations. He said that whether
the UN will "survive" the "direct
challenge" of the North Korean at
tack depends entirely on the speed
and vigor free nations display in
supporting its edicts.
Mr. Truman began the news con
ference with an announcement that
he is sending an economic survey
! mission to the Philippines to study
ways to help rebuild the islands'
economy. The mission will be head
ed by former Under Secretary of
the Treasury Daniel W. Bell, now a
Washington, D.C., banker.
The President had previously an
nounced —at the time he ordered
U.S. forces to help defend South
Korea and Formosa—that U.S. mili
tary units in the Philippines would
be strengthened to discourage Com
munist ambitions.
Asked about possible employment
of U.S. ground forces, the President
sidestepped the issue with the firm
' statement that he could not com-
I ment on U.S. military strategy.
