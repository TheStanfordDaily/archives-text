## War News First 
### 
Yesterday, a student came into this office and bitterly com
plained that The Daily had completely disregarded campus news
for the sensationalistic war news from Korea. He argued that the
campus paper's sole job was to keep the campus informed, and
thus it should stick mainly to local matters.
We would like to remind this student, and others like him, that
the war in Korea, although not taking place on your front steps at
the moment, is of very great concern to each and every one of us.
The President Tuesday made a flat declaration of U.S. policy
—a declaration to use arms to keep the Communist influence
within its present sphere.
When United States forces are actively fighting the enemy, we
are affected. The last war is still fresh in our mind; we know all
too well what another war would mean: draft, casualty lists, taxes,
rationing, restrictions, and the like. If Russia meets our challange
and decides to actively support support Northern Korea, we will
be right in the midst of World War 111.
Korea is a powder keg; we have inserted the fuse; Russia is
holding the match. What happens in Korea is of vital interest to
everyone of us. Let's get away from this stagnant, dangerous
feeling of isolationism —the time has come to extend our horizons
to the entire world, to realize that the fighting in Korea affects the
freedom and well being of everyone of us. War news is of first
importance to us all, and The Daily is going to treat it as such.
