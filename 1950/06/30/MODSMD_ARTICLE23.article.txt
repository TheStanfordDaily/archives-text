# Bob Mathias Leads Field At Decathlon Mid-Mark
## 
### 
TULARE, June 29 (UP) —Bob
Mathias, 19-year-old iron man of j
the decathlon, threatened to crack j
the world's record as he took an
early lead in the two-day National
AAU Decathlon Championship here |
tonight.
Mathias, with two AAU crowns
and an Olympic championship be
hind him, collected an unexpected |
total of 2,566 points after complet
ing the 100-meter, broad jump, and :
shot put in the grueling 10-event
classic.
A crowd of 7,000 home-towners
cheered their favorite son as he bet
tered every official mark he has ;
ever made.
He was leading Bill Albans of the
University of North Carolina by a
scant 56 points, but Mathias' strong
est events were yet to come—events j
such as the javelin, discus, and pole j
vnult in which "Tulare Bob" has i
remonstrated his enduring strength
against all comers.
Mathias, after three events, held a
130-point lead over a 14-year-old

record set by Glenn Morris in the j
Berlin Olympics. And he was 254
points ahead of last year's mark
when he captured the 1949 decath
lon.
These three events were the only {
ones in by the time The Daily went
to press. The Stanford Flash should,
however, hold his own in the broad
jump and the high jump, which
were run late last night.
Should Mathias do anywhere near
his best in these two events, it
would set him up for a clean sweep
of the world's record tonight when
the second half of the grueling ten j
events are run.
For tonight the Indian Iron Man
will tackle some of his favorite
events — the 110 - meter high hur
dles (best: 14.8), the discus (best:
152 ft. 10 in.), pole vault (best: 12 ft.
10 ir..), javelin (best: 177 ft. 10 in.),
and the 1,500-meter run (best: 4:55).
It looks very much, this morning,
that a world's champion decathlon
man will come back to the Farm
next fall.
