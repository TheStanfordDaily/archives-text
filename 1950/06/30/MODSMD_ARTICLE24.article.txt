NEW YORK, June 29 (UP) —
Those bat - happy Boston Red Sox
blasted past the 20-run mark for
the third, time this season today
when they walloped the Philadel
phia Athletics by the football score
of 22 to 14, winning their seventh
straight game under their new
manager, Steve O'Neill.
The Red Sox pitching also being
strictly on the sour side, the two
teams surpassed an old American
League mark for total runs in a
•'ame, the 3G topping the 35 set by
Tigers in 1921, and tied by Cleve
land and St. Louis in 1925, and Chi
cago at Philadelphia in 1930. The
major league mark of 49 was set
in a 26-23 wooden wedding in which
the Cubs topped the Phillies in 1922.
The Red Sox made 19 hits includ
ing Ted Williams' 24th homer and a
double, with which he drove in six
runs. The hits were pretty evenly
distributed, Walt Dropo and Billy
Goodman getting three apiece,
while Williams, Bobby Doerr, Tom
Wright, and Matt Batts made two
each.
At New York, the spunky Sena
tors also had a hitting field day,
getting 18 safe blows including a
three-run homer by rookie Irv No
ren in a 12 to 7 maltreatment of the
ex-Brownie section of the Yankee
pitching staff—Joe Ostrowski, Tom
