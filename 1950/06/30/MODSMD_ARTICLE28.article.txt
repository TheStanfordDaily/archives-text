# Stanford Players Open 'Accent on Youth'; Summer Stock Program Proves Successful
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The Stanford Players unveiled
their new summer stock program
Wednesday night in the Little The
ater with a belly-laugh production
of the comedy "Accent on Youth."
Should the remaining three play
productions prove as polished and
successful as the first, then this
quick - rehearsal, small - production
method ought to rate permanent
adoption. They can't improve much
on Wednesday night's results.
Written by Samson Raphaelson. [
"Accent on Youth" gently lampoons I
the artificiality of theater people '
and all the while tells the subtly J
hilarious story of a "riper and fuller
capacity for love at the ;«ge of 50

and thereafter." Throughout the
play, a great number of people
moan and languish for youth
and sonorously sound off about the
hell of growing old.
Yet, in the final analysis, no one,
least of all the author, seems to give
a good hoot about anyone's age as
long as he remembers to live as gra
ciously as God allows. Using a car
icature of the highly intense, i-ed
blooded American boy, Raphaelson
simultaneously pats youth on the
head and administers a swift kick in
the pants for knocking over a pot
ted plant in the calm and mature
house of life. The result is two and
one-half hours of high and subtle
entertainment.

Introduced along with the new
j production idea was a whole new
! crop of players, the lot of whom
: were as excellent as the play. The
j best judgment seems to lie in the
! fact that 30 minutes after the play
began, the deadly feeling too often
associated with college dramatics
had disappeared into a full interest
in the play itself.
John Jenings as the aging, gay
j dog playwright had the most fun.
With fine stage presence and a
skillful playing of the highly af
fected Steven Gaye, Jenings set the
pace and success of the perform
j ance. Nancy DeYoung combined
| enthusiasm, looks, and a superb de
j colletage into a femiinne radiance
I which any old man of 6 to (>0 would
i stomp and whistle at. Vivian Rus
sell was fine as the shrieking, minc
| ing portrait of unrequited love.
; Tops also was the quiet humor ot
Stuart Hyde and Robert Putnam
and the exuberance of Townsend
i Brown.
