# Community-School Co-operation Urged by Educator Wanamaker
## 
### 
The greatest need of public edu
cation is better co-operation be
tween the school and tho commu
nity, according to Mrs. Pearl Wana
maker, superintendent of public in
struction for the State of Washing
ton.
Before a near-capacity audience
in the Cubberley Auditorium Tues
day evening, Mrs. Wanamaker em
phasized the importance of building
an educational program understood,
appreciated, and participated in by
every citizen. She warned educa
tors against operating their school
systems along the easier established
lines and expecting parents to fall in
mechanically behind them.
The problem of educating youth.

she said, is becoming increasingly
rugged. Some areas are meeting
the challenge adequately, while
others are not. At any rate, she
concluded, it is time for all educa
tors to take inventory of their ob
jectives and their fulfillment of
those objectives.
Mrs. Wanamaker went on record
as strongly opposing Reorganization
Plan 27, now before Congress, be
cause it "brings education into par
tisan politics." The plan would cre
ate a new cabinet Secretary of Pub
lic Health, Education, and Welfare.
The local area, she declared, can
best work out its own peculiar
problems through the joint efforts
of parents and teachers.
