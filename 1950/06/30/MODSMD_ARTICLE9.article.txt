WASHINGTON, June 29 — You
hear occasional cynical and pessi
mistic comments—"This is where I
came in," people say, remembering
December of 1941. You hear specu
lations about what Congress will do,
what agencies will be set up, in the
event of all-out war. But you be
lieve and hope that President Tru
man's caculated risk—his action in j
ordering U.S. air and naval forces
I to Korea —will prevent World War i
J 111 rather than set it of?.
You think he did the right thing,
'.he only thing. Admiration and ap- j

proval for the President's decision
is practically unanimous here, in
Congress and in all of Washington.
The little man was dealing with
a big problem. Photographs of the
President showed him with a sol
emn and determined face. At the
convention of the American News
paper Guild on Wednesday Truman
looked tired but still cheerful. He
had told the Reserve Officers' Asso
ciation that morning that "We face
a serious situation. We hope we
face it in the cause of peace."
To the group of newsmen he
talked about the Point Four program
of technical assistance to underde
veloped countries. "Defenses are
njt our only task," he reminded a

war-conscious people; "we have
also the constructive task of build
ing a peace behind the shield of
those defenses."
You can see some of Washing
ton's tension in the extra protection
given President Truman by the Se
'cret Service. Four of the big men
in civilian clothes now walk with
him, instead of one. The organiza
tion entrusted with the safety of
the President all but turned the
Guild convention upside down, in
the name of "emergency restric
tions," before he could speak there.
But however hectic the Korean
crisis has made life in many parts
of Washington, the capital city is
still a city at peace.
