TOKYO. Monday, July 3 (UP)
—Planes bearing the star of So
viet Russia strafed Suwon Air
field a few hours before tank-led
Communist spearheads launched a
new offensive in Red - invaded
South Korea before dawn today.
American B-29 bombers lashed
back at the Communists, blasting
North Korea's Yonpo Airfield, while
U.S. combat troops "deployed for
action" against the invaders.
So far no American combat unit
had clashed with the Communists,
United Press War Correspondent
Robert C. Miller reported from an
American base in Korea, but U.S.
officers are serving in "advisory ca
pacities" with the South Korean
units who are trying to hold the
wavering battle line.
Americans flown to Korea from
Japan last week have been ordered
to take the field as soon as possible.
Miller reported, but it was expected
to be at least 48 hours before they
were ready to join the fight.
Fourteen Communist planes —
four marked with the unadorned
red star of Russia—hit the South
Korean airfield late yesterday.

Jack James was shot in the foot, six
South Korean soldiers were injured
slightly, and a train was set afire
by the raiding planes.
Early today, Miller reported from
American headquarters in Korea
that the two Red spearheads had
crossed the Han River south of cap
tured Seoul.
A spokesman at the advance
headquarters, said lhat other North
Korean forces had hammered their
way 10 miles through South Korean
defenses in a pre-dawn flanking at
tack east of Suwon.
South Korean sources reported
Friday that the Communists had
crossed the river line at Youngdun
po and Kimpo, and Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur's headquarters here an
nounced last night that a "moder
ate number" of Red tanks had been
brought across the Han.
Today's announcement from ad
vance headquarters, however, was
the first indication that the tanks
were leading the sweeping flank at
tack east of Suwon.
American troops were being
rushed northward on all available
transportation as the tank advance
created a new threat to the front.
Earlier in the eight-day-old war,
tanks had proved the most effective
weapon in the North Korean arse
nal.
The sky was overcast today, but
the clouds weer not dense and offi
cers here believed it would be pos
sible to rush further American re
inforcements to Korea by air.
