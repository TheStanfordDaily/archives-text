Worried about the new Draft Act?
Well, to ease your fears, here's the latest information on the bill Presi
lent Truman signed into law on Friday.
Every youth must register with the local draft board within five days
after reaching his eighteenth birthday. But nobody can be drafted before
le is 19.
When and if the President and military leaders decide that it is time
o start, drafting for active duty (there is a 21 months' limit on length of
service), the following exemption regulations will apply:
1. Ministers and students studying for the ministry.
2. Aliens who are not interested in becoming citizens.
.i. Sole surviving sons of families which lost one or more members due
o service in the armed forces.
4. Conscientious objectors who say. because of their religious beliefs,
hey can't perform any kind of military service.
5. War veterans who served in the armed forces at least 90 days be
ween September 7. 1941, and September 12. 1945.
•». Service veterans who served 12 months between September 13, 1940,
ind June 24, 1948.
7. Anybody over 26 years of age.
X. Members of a reserve outfit, like the National Guard or the Officers'
Reserve. (But, here's the important change made by the new law. The
President can call the reserves into active service any time he thinks
hey're needed.)
College students in advanced (upper division") courses in the ROTC
That's the new bill. The really important question, and one that has
not been definitely answered, is, What of a youth who wants to finish his
schooling? At the moment, the boards will defer a youth in high school
>r college until he has finished the year and then he will be drafted. This
really amounts to only a postponement.
It's all up to the President. If he thinks things are getting too hot in
Korea, he can enact the bill immediately and the drafting will start. The
exemptions stated above are those most pertinent to college students. But,
from where I sit. it looks as if there are mighty few of us who would fall
under the jurisdiction of any one of them.
