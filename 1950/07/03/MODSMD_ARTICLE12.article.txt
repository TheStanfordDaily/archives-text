# Solar Attack Sends People To Showers
## 
### TOM MULLAN Jr 
For the past four days students
and faculty members alike have
had to endure the heat in the Bay
Area.
With temperatures ranging from
a fetid 114 registered in Tulare
where Stanford's Bob Mathias
breezed to a new world's decathlon
record (no doubt he regretted the
warm reception with which he was
greeted), to a mere sweltering 96 in
the Palo Alto vicinity, various
methods have been tried to combat
the solar attack, all with varying
degrees of success.
Blythe, California, has reported a
searing 127 which threatened to
curl the thin skins of the dates so
abundant in that locality. However,
in the luxurious air-conditioned of
fices of The Stanford Daily, house
boys could be observed scurrying
from one desk to the next passing
out papaya juice to editors and re
porters completely oblivious to the
atmospheric conditions which made
other poor mortals cringe under the
rays of the sun.
There are still other ways and
means of relief possible. Sugges
tions have been offered all the way
from closing the windows and
drawing the shades in order to be
just stifled, to completely submerg
ing one's body in water to be slowly
broiled.
Exponents of still another more
courageous and hardy camp con
tend that the only method of beat
ing the thermometer is to "wear
only wool shirts," and explain to
the doubters that the old "desert
rats" in the wastes of Southern Cal
ifornia find that the gusts of wind
so frequent in those parts have a
cooling effect on the sweat-drenched
wool.
