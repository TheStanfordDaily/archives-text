WASHINGTON. July 2—A week
of crisis and fast - breaking news
here means that there has been a
continual cluster of people around
every office teletype machine, wait
ing for the newest development
from Korea. Adding to the air of
tension is the fact that military
leaves and passes have been cur
tailed. "We are not at war," the
President has pointed out, but the
outcome of the action in Korea is
still uppermost in everyone's mind.
Calmly but incisively, Secretary
of State Acheson stated yesterday
that the fate of the United Nations
depends on the restoration of the
peace in the Far East and of the
UN-sponsored and accepted South
Korean government. Washington
knows that the world-wide prestige
of the United States is also in the
balance, and the entire town —from
the press to the government work
ers and from the cab drivers to the
Republican minority—is supporting
the President's action with unani
mous but serious acclaim.
On the lighter side, however, one
old hand around the capita! has dis
covered that the 38th parallel, ex
tended beyond Korea to eastern
North America, approximates the
Mason - Dixon Line. He draws no
conclusions, but the situation seems
to have infinite possibilities.
Outside of the crisis, life in Wash
ington is going on as usual. Con
gress is not unaware of Korea; in
fact, a Democratic representative
from South Carolina has suggested
that we drop an atomic bomb on
North Korea, and—at the other ex
treme—Senator Taft has demanded
Secretary of State Dean Acheson's
resignation. But, as yet. no action
has been taken on either of the
Congressmen's suggestion.
The quick passage of the new

j draft bill indicates the readiness of
the Hill to pass measures for na
| tional defense. The House District
j Committee has approved a special
j civilian defense program "or the
} capital city, which will go before
the House soon.
The other big news breaks on
I Capitol Hill this week—for, Korea
I or no, the routine of government
never ceases here —have been: ap
propriations, slot machines, and the
i problem of "foreign milk" in the
i District of Columbia.
One of the better stories traveling
| around top Washington circles is
: about the Communist party in Cze
| choslovakia, which, it appears, was
having a membership drive. They
found that they had to offer some
incentive to get new members in,
, though. So they came out with this
decree: A party member who
I brought in three new members
; would be exempt from his dues
I for one year; a party member who
| brought in five would be released
I from having to wear his party insig-
I nia; and anyone who brought in ten
would be given a signed statement
that he had never been a party
member.
Not too good, but that's Washing
ton today.
