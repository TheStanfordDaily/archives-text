# Stengel Moves DiMaggio To First Base Today
## 
### 
BOSTON. July 2 (UP)—Joe Di-
Maggio. after 12 big league sea
sons in the outfield, will attempt
to launch a new career at first
base for the New York Yankees
tomorrow.
The announcement of DiMaggio's
shift — which will be inaugurated
against the Senators at Washington
tomorrow —was made by Manager

Casey Stengel in a desperate effort
to clear up the current muddle at
first base.
Tommy Heinrich, also an out
fielder originally, no longer is phys
ically able to play first base regu
larly because of a serious knee in
jury. Burly Johnny Mize, acquired
from the New York Giants last sea
son, does not fill the bill, and young
Joe Collins has been handcuffed by
southpaw pitching,
DiMaggio, who started his pro
fessional baseball career as a short
stop for San Francisco of the Pa
cific Coast Legaue 18 years ago,
transferred the outfield after six
irulings in the infield and has been
there since. He never has played
first base—even in practice—until
today.
Before today's game against Bos
ton, DiMaggio, with a first base
man's mitt borrowed from Mize,
t J'jk over his new station amid a
lusty chorus of jibes and wisecracks

from the interested Red Sox play
ers.
He interrupted his experiment at
first base only to take his batting
practice licks. He looked acceptable
but not sensational at his new po
sition.
DiMaggio's sudden transfer after
so many years in the outfield was
predicated by two factors. Stengel
wants more adequate protection at
first base, and DiMaggio's defensive
play in the outfield has sagged con
siderably.
Stengel made it clear that he, not
DiMaggio, had suggested the
change. When DiMaggio had the sug
gestion broached to him, he accept
ed It matter-of-factly. He agreed
to give first base a trial but made
no promises of success.
Stengel, confident that DiMag
gio's natural ability will allow him
to play any position, predicted that
his high-salaried star will conquer
the new job quickly.
