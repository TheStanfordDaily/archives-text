# Iceland Next for Mathias
## 
### 
With his life's ambtiion — the
world's decathlon championship —
tucked nicely away, Stanford's Bob
Mathias is today resting after his
grueling 10-event task in his home
town —the happy hamlet of Tulare.
In three weeks the world's champ
will travel to Iceland for a two
man decathlon match with Iceland's
Claussen, who came in second to
Mathias in the Olympic games of
1948. From the chilly island, Bob
will go via AAU sponsorship to
Scandinavia, where he will perform
with one of the traveling AAU track
squads.
His coach, Jack Weiersaouser, is

still breathing sighs of relief after
North Carolina's Bill Albans nearly
pulled the great upset at Tulare
last weekend. "We respected Al
bans," the coach said, "and after
the first night we could see a loss.
But Bob came through when the
chips were down."
