### 
Overcrowding in the nation's
public schools has become so seri
ous, says the latest report of the
National Education Association, that
47 per cent of the cities over 100.000
in population are denying some |
children full-time education.
The report, based on a recent na
tional survey by the NEA. says that
the situation is most acute in the I
Far Western states, where 31 per I
cent of the city school buildings are
crowded to the point oi physica'
hazard and mental handicap The J
Southwest and Southeast, with 29 i
per cent and 26 per cent, respee- !
tively, of their buildings tilled be- |
vond capacity, rank next on the
critical list.
While proportionately fewer oi
the rural and small - town schools
throughout the nation have been
forced into half-time sessions, it is
there that crowded conditions are
more frequently worse.
The problem at present is urgent
only in the elementary schools, ac
cording to the report, since the high
schools have not yet appreciably
felt the recent population boom.
There are more factors than pop
ulation increase, says the NEA. be
hind the rise in school enrollments.
Important also rae population shifts,
a greater need in modern living for
education, and an increased desire
and financial ability of parents to
educate their children. A stricter
enforcement of school attendance
and child labor laws has also
brought more pupils into the class
room.
