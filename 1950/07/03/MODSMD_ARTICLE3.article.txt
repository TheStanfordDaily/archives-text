## 
### 
UC President Robert Gordon
Sproul last Saturday summed up
his stand on the loyalty oath row
in the California Monthly, the
alumni publication.
"I hold." Sproul said, "that a Uni
versity cannot abide in its company
men who owe their allegiance and
subordinate their independence to a
totalitarion organization.
"Under the guise of academic
freedom, the Communist party has
persistently . . . sought to carry
out in American colleges a program
of indoctrination and propaganda
against the spiritual, as well as the
material, values of democracy."
"Nor does it meet the issue," he
declared, "to say that a Communist
may be a perfectly satisfactory
teacher of astronomy or accounting.
. . . The party has decreed that the
class struggle affects every field of
knowledge and that the party line
enters into every field of thought."
