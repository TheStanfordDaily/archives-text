# University Will Offer Architecture As Major Course Next Fall Quarter
## 
### 
Architecture will he offered as a
1 major course when the fall quarter
opens at Stanford in September.
Couises leading to Bachelor's and
Master's degrees will give profes
sional training in architecture to
students planning a career in the
field.
The courses will be offered by the
Art Department, which is being en-
I larged in scope to the Department
of Art and Architecture.
The undergraduate program dur
ing the first two years will include
basic courses in art, architecture,
mathematics, and engineering in
addition to regular lower division
requirements in the humanities,
natural and social sciences.
In the third and fourth years the
student will take courses in house,
interior. and landscape design.
These will teach him the relation
ship between structural materials
and technology in relation to site,
■jlimate, and human needs for the
structure.
Two additional years of study will
be required for the Master of Arts
degree. The student will complete
a flexible program of study designed
to 3 ; .ve him a strong engineering

I and technological background.
During the second year of gradu
ate work the emphasis will be
placed on architecture's part in re
gional and city planning. The stu
dent will also spend three months
as an apprentice under a registered
architect before he receives his
M.A. degree.
Students will be taught by cur
rent Art Department faculty mem
bers who will be augmented by pro
fessional architects and architectu
j ral engineers serving as visiting
professors. Virgil Thompson, asso
' ciate professor of architecture, will
co-ordinate the program.
The University's decision to set
up the architectural courses was
based on the following points, ac
cording to Dr. Ray Nelson Faulk
ner. Art Department head:
"1. The Bay Area is considered
one of the richest architectural
areas by architects throughout this
country. The tremendous activity
and vitality of work being produced
in the area has made it a mecca for
students of today's architecture.
From this point of view the Bay
Area represents one of the best
"laboratories" available for study of

modern building.
"2. There is a great need for re
search in all phases of the building
industry. Of all the major indus
tries in the United States, building
i is the largest and by modern tech
! nological standards it is also the
most backward. The industry has
I made little organized effort to avail
itself of the full power of modern
technoolgy. Information on the
physical properties of most mate
rials is readily available but from
j the point of view of the architect
who is designing man's environ
ment, nor organized information ex
ists on the psychological and emo
tional qualities of these materials.
"3. There is a great need for co
ordination between the profession
of architecture and the educational
institution. Standards remain to be
worked out by the profession and
by the colleges. There is a great op
portunity for Stanford to participate
in this movement because of its phi
losophy. faculty interest, and physi
cal plant.
"4. Stanford's fine School of En-,
gineering will co-operate with the
Art Department in providing train -
ing in structural principles."

Architecture will he offered as a
1 major course when the fall quarter
opens at Stanford in September.
Couises leading to Bachelor's and
Master's degrees will give profes
sional training in architecture to
students planning a career in the
field.
The courses will be offered by the
Art Department, which is being en-
I larged in scope to the Department
of Art and Architecture.
The undergraduate program dur
ing the first two years will include
basic courses in art, architecture,
mathematics, and engineering in
addition to regular lower division
requirements in the humanities,
natural and social sciences.
In the third and fourth years the
student will take courses in house,
interior. and landscape design.
These will teach him the relation
ship between structural materials
and technology in relation to site,
■jlimate, and human needs for the
structure.
Two additional years of study will
be required for the Master of Arts
degree. The student will complete
a flexible program of study designed
to 3 ; .ve him a strong engineering

I and technological background.
During the second year of gradu
ate work the emphasis will be
placed on architecture's part in re
gional and city planning. The stu
dent will also spend three months
as an apprentice under a registered
architect before he receives his
M.A. degree.
Students will be taught by cur
rent Art Department faculty mem
bers who will be augmented by pro
fessional architects and architectu
j ral engineers serving as visiting
professors. Virgil Thompson, asso
' ciate professor of architecture, will
co-ordinate the program.
The University's decision to set
up the architectural courses was
based on the following points, ac
cording to Dr. Ray Nelson Faulk
ner. Art Department head:
"1. The Bay Area is considered
one of the richest architectural
areas by architects throughout this
country. The tremendous activity
and vitality of work being produced
in the area has made it a mecca for
students of today's architecture.
From this point of view the Bay
Area represents one of the best
"laboratories" available for study of

modern building.
"2. There is a great need for re
search in all phases of the building
industry. Of all the major indus
tries in the United States, building
i is the largest and by modern tech
! nological standards it is also the
most backward. The industry has
I made little organized effort to avail
itself of the full power of modern
technoolgy. Information on the
physical properties of most mate
rials is readily available but from
j the point of view of the architect
who is designing man's environ
ment, nor organized information ex
ists on the psychological and emo
tional qualities of these materials.
"3. There is a great need for co
ordination between the profession
of architecture and the educational
institution. Standards remain to be
worked out by the profession and
by the colleges. There is a great op
portunity for Stanford to participate
in this movement because of its phi
losophy. faculty interest, and physi
cal plant.
"4. Stanford's fine School of En-,
gineering will co-operate with the
Art Department in providing train -
ing in structural principles."
