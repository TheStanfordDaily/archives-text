## A 						Letter to Sponsors 
### 
A newspaper has an important role in any community—to act
a» a check on the governing body of the area and to inform this
body of any complaints received against the governors.
This is the job that we would like to undertake today. It has
come to our attention that some of the freshman sponsors have
gone beyond the boundaries of their advisory job and instead
have tried to control their charges by direct orders—orders that
have so frightened some of the freshman girls that they have
been unable to participate in the normal campus life.
These girls were told not to work on The Daily this summer as
they are here only to get good grades and thus should put all their
time on their studies. They were not advised to spend more time
on their studies, nor were they told to use moderation in extra
curricular activities. They were bluntly told that they should not
have anything to do with campus organizations.
A.t the same time, the scare technique of propaganda was put
into effect. The girls were told that, in order to come back to
school winter quarter, they would have to get very high averages
they were not told how high) and that few of them had a chance
of returning.
This attitude is not conducive to good education. The teachers
are not out to flunk all their pupils, or even a large majority of
them. But, after such counseling by their sponsors, a lot of the
treshman girls have such an attitude and the girls are unable to
essume a normal, healthy perspective toward their work.
The job of the sponsor is to guide and generally help the fresh
men—to help them in their social work, to help them in their
studies, and to help them in the general process of college orien
tation..
What many of the sponsors fail to realize is that the freshmen
look up to them with a sense of awe and that everything a sponsor
says is given double importance. The sponsors are obeyed with
out question as the freshmen know that the sponsors have a lot
to do in determining whether the students will return next winter.
If the sponsors do have this power, they should realize it and
realize that they have a real job of guidance and help. Not to
tell the freshmen that they can't work on The Daily, but to point
out to them the amount of school work they are expected to do,
and try and show them how much free time they have and how
it would be best to spend this free time. Not to scare them half to
death about their chances of returning next winter, but to show
>hem how they can make good grades so that there will be no
question of their returning.
A. sponsor has a tremendous responsibility toward the fresh
men. To abuse this responsibility will mean the downfall of both
the sponsor system and many of the freshmen. To appreciate and
axercise this responsibility to the fullest will mean a healthier,
happier freshman class—a freshman class that will return in its
entirety at the start of winter quarter.

it would be best to spend this free time. Not to scare them half to
death about their chances of returning next winter, but to show
>hem how they can make good grades so that there will be no
question of their returning.
A. sponsor has a tremendous responsibility toward the fresh
men. To abuse this responsibility will mean the downfall of both
the sponsor system and many of the freshmen. To appreciate and
axercise this responsibility to the fullest will mean a healthier,
happier freshman class—a freshman class that will return in its
entirety at the start of winter quarter.
A newspaper has an important role in any community—to act
a» a check on the governing body of the area and to inform this
body of any complaints received against the governors.
This is the job that we would like to undertake today. It has
come to our attention that some of the freshman sponsors have
gone beyond the boundaries of their advisory job and instead
have tried to control their charges by direct orders—orders that
have so frightened some of the freshman girls that they have
been unable to participate in the normal campus life.
These girls were told not to work on The Daily this summer as
they are here only to get good grades and thus should put all their
time on their studies. They were not advised to spend more time
on their studies, nor were they told to use moderation in extra
curricular activities. They were bluntly told that they should not
have anything to do with campus organizations.
A.t the same time, the scare technique of propaganda was put
into effect. The girls were told that, in order to come back to
school winter quarter, they would have to get very high averages
they were not told how high) and that few of them had a chance
of returning.
This attitude is not conducive to good education. The teachers
are not out to flunk all their pupils, or even a large majority of
them. But, after such counseling by their sponsors, a lot of the
treshman girls have such an attitude and the girls are unable to
essume a normal, healthy perspective toward their work.
The job of the sponsor is to guide and generally help the fresh
men—to help them in their social work, to help them in their
studies, and to help them in the general process of college orien
tation..
What many of the sponsors fail to realize is that the freshmen
look up to them with a sense of awe and that everything a sponsor
says is given double importance. The sponsors are obeyed with
out question as the freshmen know that the sponsors have a lot
to do in determining whether the students will return next winter.
If the sponsors do have this power, they should realize it and
realize that they have a real job of guidance and help. Not to
tell the freshmen that they can't work on The Daily, but to point
out to them the amount of school work they are expected to do,
and try and show them how much free time they have and how
it would be best to spend this free time. Not to scare them half to
death about their chances of returning next winter, but to show
>hem how they can make good grades so that there will be no
question of their returning.
