## Give 'em a Lift 
### 
Tiaditions are a sore point among college editors. All year long
they are besieged with requests from loyal alumni to reproach
the student body for breaking certain time-honored customs.
We feel, however, that even though a lot of Stanford traditions
ire a pain-in-the-neck, there is one tradition that makes a lot of
senseâ€”the "pick 'em up" tradition.
Summer days are hot and muggy. It's a long way to Paly and
a lot of students are without any means of transportation what
soever. If you are lucky enough to have wheels, give your fellow
students a break.
Even if they are walking along the road and not standing at
either end of Palm Drive, stop and give 'em a lift. Hot and tired,
they will be everlastingly grateful to you.
