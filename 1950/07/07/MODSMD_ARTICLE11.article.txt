members of the student body to get to know, informally, the visit
ing professors and older students.
We realize that this is not always possible and that often there
is no way even to know who these men. are. Therefore, starting

get a lot of teachers are pretty good guys outside the classroom.
Try and get to know them—you won't regret it.
