## Ed School Roundup 
### 
Enrollment in Stanford's School of Education has reached a new high,
according to a statement by Dean Bartky.
Present enrollment is estimated at 1.200, an increase of 20 per cent over
that of last summer. About half of the enrollees come from outside the
.state, says Dean Bartky. Included among the 1.200 are at least 30 super- |
mtcndents of schools.
The School of Education has expanded its offering of courses for the '
summer quarter to other schools in the University.
There is a critical teacher shortage in America's elementary schools,
a recent NEA report discloses.
In 1949-50 about 77,084 new elementary teachers were needed, while
(he actual number was between 30.000 and 32.000. Of this number about
3,000 held substandard certificates.
At the present rate of teacher training the next decade will produce
between 250,000 and 300,000 new teachers to fill 750.000 new positions.
The swollen ranks of the elementary schools are expected to flood the
high schools in 1956-57. The rocketing enrollment in public schools will
probably level ofl in 1958 at a figure of about 31.091,000. as compared with ;
26,635,000 in 1950.
Expenditures for public education in the United States are greater in
1950 than ever before, according to a recent NEA survey.
The average annual cost per pupil has risen from $16.88 in 1900 to
$185 in 1950. In terms of 1900 dollar power, however, the 1950 cost is $62.95
per pupil, a sum still larger than any previous figure.
Total expenditures for public schools arc placed at more than four and !
a half billion dollars in 1950, as compared to less than a quarter-billion
in 1900. The current figure, computed on the 1900 scale of values, comes
to about one and a half billions.
It should be pointed out, however, that only 1.84 per cent of the current ;
national income is being spent on public education, as compared to 3.09
per cent in 1930 and 2.88 per cent in 1940. The percentage in 1900 was 1.20.
With a total of GO regular students and seven part-time students en- ;
rolled, the Stanford-N.B.C. Radio-Television Institute is well on its way
to the eighth successful summer.
The faculty for the summer consists of Dr. Stanley T. Donner, who acts
as director of the Radio Institute; Dr. Skipwith W. Athey, assistant pro
fessor of electrical engineering and speech; Mr. Alfred Crapsey, sales man- j
ager; Mr. John W. Elwood, general manager of KNBC and executive with
RCA and NBC; Mr. Anthony Freeman, musical director of KNBC; Mr. ;
George Greaves, assistant general manager of KNBC: Mr. John B. Grover,
producer for NBC; Miss Marjorie McGilvrey, radio laboratory and admin
istrative assistant; Mr. Budd Heyde, announcer at KNBC; Mr. William
Minette, public affairs executive at KNBC; Mrs. Inez G. Richardson, cura
tor, Ray Lyman Wilbur Collection on Social Problems; Mr. Paul Speegle.
program manager at KNBC; Mr. John Thompson, manager of news and
special events at KNBC; Dr. Edgar E. Willis, radio writer; and Mr. Hal
Wolf, assistant manager of KNBC.
One of the projects which are directed by the students enrolled in the j
institute is the "manning" and operation of Station KZSU, which is on |
the air Sunday through Friday from 7 to 11:05 p.m., on 880 kilocycles.

Enrollment in Stanford's School of Education has reached a new high,
according to a statement by Dean Bartky.
Present enrollment is estimated at 1.200, an increase of 20 per cent over
that of last summer. About half of the enrollees come from outside the
.state, says Dean Bartky. Included among the 1.200 are at least 30 super- |
mtcndents of schools.
The School of Education has expanded its offering of courses for the '
summer quarter to other schools in the University.
There is a critical teacher shortage in America's elementary schools,
a recent NEA report discloses.
In 1949-50 about 77,084 new elementary teachers were needed, while
(he actual number was between 30.000 and 32.000. Of this number about
3,000 held substandard certificates.
At the present rate of teacher training the next decade will produce
between 250,000 and 300,000 new teachers to fill 750.000 new positions.
The swollen ranks of the elementary schools are expected to flood the
high schools in 1956-57. The rocketing enrollment in public schools will
probably level ofl in 1958 at a figure of about 31.091,000. as compared with ;
26,635,000 in 1950.
Expenditures for public education in the United States are greater in
1950 than ever before, according to a recent NEA survey.
The average annual cost per pupil has risen from $16.88 in 1900 to
$185 in 1950. In terms of 1900 dollar power, however, the 1950 cost is $62.95
per pupil, a sum still larger than any previous figure.
Total expenditures for public schools arc placed at more than four and !
a half billion dollars in 1950, as compared to less than a quarter-billion
in 1900. The current figure, computed on the 1900 scale of values, comes
to about one and a half billions.
It should be pointed out, however, that only 1.84 per cent of the current ;
national income is being spent on public education, as compared to 3.09
per cent in 1930 and 2.88 per cent in 1940. The percentage in 1900 was 1.20.
With a total of GO regular students and seven part-time students en- ;
rolled, the Stanford-N.B.C. Radio-Television Institute is well on its way
to the eighth successful summer.
The faculty for the summer consists of Dr. Stanley T. Donner, who acts
as director of the Radio Institute; Dr. Skipwith W. Athey, assistant pro
fessor of electrical engineering and speech; Mr. Alfred Crapsey, sales man- j
ager; Mr. John W. Elwood, general manager of KNBC and executive with
