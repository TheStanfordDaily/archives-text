# ON THE BENCH WITH AL BERRY

### 
Last Monday Ihe City papers carried a small blurb stating that Ray
lammett, Stanford's likeable backfield coach, had tendered his resigna
ion, effective September 1. to Athletic Director A 1 Masters. The papers
lid not elaborate on the subject much, just the. bare facts. I would like
o «o into it a little deeper. Ray has been around here too long and has

ontributed too much to Stanford to
lie dismissed with a lew obscure
ines in the Chron.
The big question to hit the in
quisitive sports - minded is. just
why did llnmmett, who has been
(tuning out good backfields since
1946. step out of the Farm grid
picture on the eve of what mo t
observers consider to he one of
'ho Indians' most successful sea
sons.
Ray, himself, is somewhat non
•mmittal: "It is a move I have been
intemplating for a long time," he
said.
Which doesn't give any concrete
reasons.
I have, for good or for bad, been
round the Stanford sporting scene
hi one capacity or another for some
years now, and while I can't speak
lor Ray or Head Coach Marchie
Schwartz, I can give forth a couple
if ideas, and pass on a few rumors
that might shed a few rays of golden
!i*ht on the subject.
First of all is the blessed L.A.
alumni. Now don't get me wroiyj;
the Southland athletic alums are

'.cry nice people and they have been more than kind to Stanford. They
have. for three long years, gleaned the best of the Southland talent and
them fondly oft' to Senator and Mrs. Stanford's Farm. Too main
nf them, however, completely unversed in the techniques of football,
feel that they are marvelously qualified to make stabs at running the
football situation from ">OO miles away.
Stanford's loss of Ray Hammett is, I feel, in some measure due to
vssure put on him and the athletic department because of these very
■yal alums.
This pressure I speak of was not of the direct iype. No alum called
and said, "Can that man." Bui there is no secret that there is dissatis
faction down smog-town way over several of the assistan tcoaches. It
was strong enough to make Hammett feel a bit uncomfortable and not
as secure as lie should have felt in view of the excellent job he has
been doing.
But then, no one is a hero in his own home town, and I guess the
sime is true of Card players who come home to coach midst the Ivory
Towers.
Another reason for Hammett's leaving can be attributed to the lack of
pportunity lor advancement here. Ray was backfield coach and frorr.
vvheer he sat there seemed no higher position he could be elevated to
As e put it, "It's been a nice four years at Stanford, but you can go only
so far as an assistant."
At this writing it seems certain that Ray is going far. It will prob
ably be announced in a couple of weeks that he has accepted a position
as head backfield coach for one of the larger and better professional
foot hall teams in the East.
And won't that be a blow to those few disgruntled L.A. alums"
Most probable replacement for Hammett, at this stage of the game,
is none other than "Perfect" Pete Kmetevic. who was left halfback and
man in motion for Clark Shaughnessy's 1940 Ruse Bowlers. Fete played
the pro game with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Detroit Lioni. He
had a very successful season as head coach at San Bernardino JC, and
currently backfield coach at USE. The announcement of the diminu
tive Kinetevic's appointment will not be forthcoming for ji few weeks
yet, but he seems to have the inside track.
