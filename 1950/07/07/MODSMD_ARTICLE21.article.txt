## 
### LARRY CAHN 
With the acceptance of seven
crack freshman track stars for sum
mer and autumn quarters, Stan
ford's cinder hopes appear as bright
as a Fourth of July celebration.
The cream of the young crop may
turn out to be Ron Bauer, a Wash
ington High of San Francisco ace,
who ran the fastest prep mile in the
United States this year at the state
meet two months ago when he
crossed the tape in 4:23.7.
On the heels of Bauer come Don
Carlson and Fred George, both of
Lowell High in San Francisco.
Carlson is a quartermiler, weight
man, and in off season has busied
himself making All-City basketball
in his junior year but injuries re
ceived in football sidelined him
from the cage game for his senior
fling. His best 440 time is 50.7. He
has thrown the discus 138 feet.
George was Lowell's 220 and 440
ace. He took two firsts in the All-
City Meet with a 50.4 in the 410
and a 22.5 in the 220.
Completing the fold from San
Francisco is Herb Schoenstein, St.
Ignatius High School high jumper
and basketballer.
From the sunny south will come

Steve Turner and Warren Sand
born, both of Glendale.
Turner is the state high and low
hurdles champion and a broad
jumper. Turner's time in the 120
highs was 14.1, a state prep record.
He also set the low hurdles mark
by running the 180-yard distance in
19 seconds flat. Turner's time of
18.9, set previously, is now up for
recognition as the nation's best.
Sandborn's event is the 880 and
his best clocking is 1:58.7.
Rounding out a potentially great
squad is Dale Newbold, sprint king
from Utah.
