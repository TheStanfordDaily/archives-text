# 20 Per Cent Increase in Compensations May Go to GI's Now Fighting in Korea

### 
American servicemen called into
action in Southern Korea might be
eligible for several benefits admin
istered by the Veterans Adminis
tration, it was announced yesterday.
Those who suffer injury or dis
ease in line of duty may be entitled
to disability compensation pay at
full war-time rates, despite the fact
that this nation is not at war.
Also, if they carry National Serv
ice Life Insurance, premium pay
ments may be waived in case of in
jury or disease "traceable to the ex

tra hazard of service" â€”and any ac
tion in South Korea could fall un
der that category.
Dependents of those who might
lose their lives in action may be en
titled to death compensation bene
fits at war-time rates.
Full war-time rates for disabil
ity and death compensation, arising
under conditions similar to the Ko
rean situation, are authorized by
Public Law 359, 77th Congress,
passed 12 days after the attack on
Pear! Harbor in 1941.
Under that law, war-time rates
are payable for disability or death
resulting from injury or disease re
ceived in line of duty "(1) as a
direct result of armed conflict, or
(2) while engaged in extra hazar
dous service, including such service
under conditions simulating war. or
(3) while the United States is en
gaged in war."
The Korean action brings the first
and second categories into play.
