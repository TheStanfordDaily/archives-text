just north of Taejon.
The new line is in the area )£
Chonan, ancient walled city 35 milea
south of Suwon. The highway
which it straddles is the main
north - south artery of Korea, ex

known —to the vital Seoul-Taejon-
Pusan highway.

East Air Forces joined wtih Navy
planes and South Korean forces to
destroy 22 Communist planes. Most
were knocked out by five days of
B-29 raids on two Communist air
bases. •;.
Stratemeyer said American air
men, experienced by 1,100 sorties in
the first 10 days, now were ready to
carry the attack to the enemy after
enggaing in defensive missions
aimed at slowing down the swift
Communist advance.
On the western front, the Com

B-29 raids on two Communist air
bases. •;.
Stratemeyer said American air
men, experienced by 1,100 sorties in
the first 10 days, now were ready to
carry the attack to the enemy after
enggaing in defensive missions
aimed at slowing down the swift
Communist advance.
On the western front, the Com
munists had taken off Wednesday
from Suwon, 50 miles south of th»*
38th parallel border. They smashed
17 miles south to Sojong. Yesterday

TOKYO, Friday, July 7 (UP) — American and South Korean
forces have fallen back to a new defense line about 40 miles north
of Taejon before a hard-driving force of 50,000 North Korean Com
munists with 100 tanks, it was announced today.
Maj. Gen. William F. Dean, commanding general of the United

States Army forces in Korea, who
made the announcement, said 15
"small divisions" of North Korean
troops were smashing against the
U.S. and South Korean forces.
He said the withdrawal was ef
fected under cover of darkness las';
night after the North Koreans had
driven 35 miles in two days toward
the American - South Korean main
defense line along the Kum River,
just north of Taejon.
The new line is in the area )£
Chonan, ancient walled city 35 milea
south of Suwon. The highway
which it straddles is the main
north - south artery of Korea, ex
tending down through Taejon to
Pusan, the big port on the southeast
coast where American troops and
supplies enter Korea,
Dean said that this latest with
drawal was made to gain time until
strong American reinforcements
could get into position.
"We are going to get all the sup
port we need," he said.
While attention centered on the
western front there was a new
threat — how big it was not yet
known —to the vital Seoul-Taejon-
Pusan highway.
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur an
nounced that movements and addi
tional strengths of enemy elements
were reported in the Pohang area,
G5 miles up the coast from Pusan.
These elements, with the aid o£
guerrillas who are active in that
area, might try to cut the highway
and the main railroad bringing up
reinforcements from Pusan.

Stratemeyer, commander of U.S.
Air Forces in the Far East, reported

half in accidents, Stratemeyer said.

East Air Forces joined wtih Navy
