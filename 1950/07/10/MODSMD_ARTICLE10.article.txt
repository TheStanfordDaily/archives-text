## Benevolent Autrocracy 
### 
To the Editor:
The Daily editorial chiding the present sponsors for their overprotec
tion of their charges was greeted by hearty cheers in this quarter. It is
ibout lime we have a public expose of the ridiculous system of benevolent
autocracy here known as '"sponsoring."
As students who have suffered the excessive concern of two ego
maniacs masquerading as campus "big wheels," we are in complete sym
pathy with any opposition to the sponsoring system.
One might expect that Stanford women, being carefully selected,
should possess some intelligence and good sense. Such is not the assump
tion of the excessively worldly-wise juniors and seniors who become
sponsors. To them, the freshmen are mere infants, thoughtless babes-in
the-woods, who must be carefully nurtured and protected, and guided
surely from their amusingly pitiful naivete to the pinnacle of sophistica
tion and wisdom epitomized by these same juniors and seniors.
Stanford is indeed fortunate to have in its student body so many living
incarnations of the Perfect Being. The self-acknowledged omniscience
and omnipotence of these individuals allows them to answer quickly and
absolutely any and all questions the trusting freshmen may have. Que
ries ranging from "When should I kiss him?" to "Whom should I vote for
tor ASSU president?"—from "What should I major in?' to "What is the
philosophical basis for the morality of the Fundamental Standard?"—are
answered unhesitatingly by these repositories of all knowledge and wis
dom.
Freshmen should be recognized for what they are: girls who have
lived successfully through 17 to 19 years fo life, and who probably have
the intelligence to live through four years more.
Sponsors are sometimes genuinely mature young women who could be
helpful friends to the freshmen less experienced in college ways. But
there should be no place in the freshman program for the neurotic, ego
striving, insecure adolescents who all too often are given the title of
sponsor.
