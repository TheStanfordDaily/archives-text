# VISITING PROFESSOR
## Blair to Speak on Humor For Tuesday Eve Series 
### DAVID WONG 
Good old American belly laughs
will be the theme of a lecture by
an amiable man from the Univer
sity of Chicago tomorrow night at
the Memorial Auditorium. The man
is Dr. Walter Blair, a visiting pro
fessor of English who has spent a
considerable time studying Ameri
can humor.
The lecture, on ''Our Changing
American Humor," will be one of
the regular Tuesday Evening Series
programs, and will be open to the
public without charge.
This summer. Dr. Blair is teach
ing a course in American fiction and
conducting a graduate seminar in
New England literature at Stanford.
Dr. Blair taught for a time at
the University of Frankfurt last
year. In an interview last week, he
said that what impressed him was
the casual attitude taken about
schedules at the German univer
sity. The semester always starts
three or four weeks after the an
nounced time and ends about a
week or so sooner than planned.
The relationships between stu
dents and professors also impressed
Dr. Blair. Students usually regard
ed professors as God - like figures
who appeared before the classes to
deliver their oracles while students
hastily wrote down their words of
wisdom.
There was also very little verbal
communication between students
and professors. Students show ap
proval of a professor by tapping on
their desks with their pencils when
the professor entered the room and
when he had finished his lecture.
They show disapproval by shuffling
their feet.
American professors in Germany,
Dr. Blair said, were trying hard to
establish the informal, friendly stu
dent - faculty relationships which
exist in the United States. Parties
were often arranged for German
students at the homes of the Amer
ican professors. The students seemed
eager for that relationship and were
extremely appreciative.
Dr. Blair said the younger Ger
man students were very democratic
in their attitudes and interests
Perhaps that was the most hopeful
sign in Germany. The older people
seemed far less interested than they

should be in political affairs. How
ever, there was a need for the in
tellectual class to be active in poli
tics if Germany was to move along
in democracy.
Going back to his field of inter
est. Dr. Blair said the Germans had
a great liking for American humor.
Mark Twain was very popular.
The Germans, however, woefully
admitted that their nation was not
very adequately equipped with a
sense of humor. German humor had
been only incidental in novels and
poems. They had never produced a

great comedy in their literature.
In Europe, humor seemed to be
tied up very much with the democ
racies. This, said Dr. Blair, may
suggest a social-political basis for
humor.

can humor.
The lecture, on ''Our Changing
American Humor," will be one of
the regular Tuesday Evening Series
programs, and will be open to the
public without charge.
This summer. Dr. Blair is teach
ing a course in American fiction and
conducting a graduate seminar in
New England literature at Stanford.
Dr. Blair taught for a time at
the University of Frankfurt last
year. In an interview last week, he
said that what impressed him was
the casual attitude taken about
schedules at the German univer
sity. The semester always starts
three or four weeks after the an
nounced time and ends about a
week or so sooner than planned.
The relationships between stu
dents and professors also impressed
Dr. Blair. Students usually regard
ed professors as God - like figures
who appeared before the classes to
deliver their oracles while students
hastily wrote down their words of
wisdom.
There was also very little verbal
communication between students
and professors. Students show ap
proval of a professor by tapping on
their desks with their pencils when
the professor entered the room and
when he had finished his lecture.
They show disapproval by shuffling
their feet.
American professors in Germany,
Dr. Blair said, were trying hard to
establish the informal, friendly stu
dent - faculty relationships which
exist in the United States. Parties
were often arranged for German
students at the homes of the Amer
ican professors. The students seemed
eager for that relationship and were
extremely appreciative.
Dr. Blair said the younger Ger
man students were very democratic
in their attitudes and interests
Perhaps that was the most hopeful
sign in Germany. The older people
seemed far less interested than they

should be in political affairs. How
ever, there was a need for the in
tellectual class to be active in poli
tics if Germany was to move along
in democracy.
Going back to his field of inter
est. Dr. Blair said the Germans had
a great liking for American humor.
Mark Twain was very popular.
The Germans, however, woefully
admitted that their nation was not
very adequately equipped with a
sense of humor. German humor had
been only incidental in novels and
poems. They had never produced a

great comedy in their literature.
In Europe, humor seemed to be
tied up very much with the democ
racies. This, said Dr. Blair, may
suggest a social-political basis for
humor.

Good old American belly laughs
will be the theme of a lecture by
an amiable man from the Univer
sity of Chicago tomorrow night at
the Memorial Auditorium. The man
is Dr. Walter Blair, a visiting pro
fessor of English who has spent a
considerable time studying Ameri
can humor.
