BOBiiY WHITE and BOYD BENSON will probably be Coach
Marchie Schwartz's first two halfbacks next fall. White, a two-year
letterman, has been rated the best right halfback on the Coast. He
stands 5 feet 11 inches, and weighs 174 pounds. It is this same White
who has caused such terror in the Los Angeles Coliseum the last two
years: He broke away for four of the Cards' five tallies in 194S against
L'CLA, and made the first bingo against USC last year with a 63-yard
sprint over ,guard.
Benson, the Kmetovic-like trickster from Washington, is the pre
season favorite to beat out the sensational Harry Hugasian for the start
ing left half post thsi year. Benson, a trim 165-pounder, was first string
for the first half of the season last year until he developed a bad case
of fumhleitis. He scored the Cards' onlv touchdown against the mighty
Wo! verines of Michigan in Stanford's third tussle in 1949. Benson is a
fairly fast and very tricky runner who excels in setting up blocks for
his interference. He was the star of the 1949 championship rugby team.
