NEWEST ADDITION to the equipment of The Stanford Dailyâ€”a Fair
child Photo-Electric Engraver. For the first lime in the history of The
Daily, members of the staff can reproduce halftone engravings in the
Daily Shack and thus give readers the v<?r,v latest pictures of campus
and world events. The machine will permit reproductions in Ihe Daily
within an hour and a half of the time the picture is snapped.
Pictured above is the new engraver (left) and Photog Marvin Tin
cher operating it. The Fairchild has a photo-electric cell which scans
the glossy print revolving on the right-hand drum. The impulse is
picked up. amplified, and transmitted to a stylus which cuts a series of
dots on a plastic plate fastened to the left-hand drum. Got that?
