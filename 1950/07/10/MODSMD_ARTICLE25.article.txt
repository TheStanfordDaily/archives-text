A 15 - minute comedy - variety
show satirizing the radio industry
similarly to the manner in which
the Stanford Chaparral satirizes the
press will be presented tonight at
7:30 over the KZSU network.
Produced by Dave Verner, a
member of the NBC-Stanford Radio
Institute, the show will be titled

"The Stanford Chaparral of the
Air," and, although there is no vis
ible connection with the Chappie,
apparently it has been given the
OK by Pat Friend and other mem
j bers of that staff.
KZSU's popular Band -of - the -
Week program, Thursday nights at
10:30, will feature Stan Kenton,
June Cristy, and the Pastels on its
next show.
