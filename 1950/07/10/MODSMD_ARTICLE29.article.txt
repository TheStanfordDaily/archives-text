## 
### 
WASHINGTON. July 9 (UP) â€”
President Truman may send Con
gress a plan this week for a huge
new propaganda war against Russia
as a "second front" to aid blitzed j
South Korea.
He is expected to underscore the
warnings of many national leaders
that the Soviet Union is winning its
campaign to hang a label of "im
perialist aggression" on America's j
fight to beat back Communist troops
in Korea.
Other Atlantic Pact nations arc
ready to co-ordinate their programs
with that of the United States.
