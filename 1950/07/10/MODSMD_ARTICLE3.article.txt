# Major Reinforcements For Korea; 2nd Infantry Alerted
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 9 (UP) —
i The entire Second Infantry Division
lat Fort Lewis, Wash., and other
! combat units from the Second,
Third. Fourth, and Sixth Army
Areas were alerted today for trans
fer to the Korean war front.
At war-time strength the Second
; Infantry Division would number
: 18.000 men but the Army refused to
divulge its present strength. It
! would say only that it does not in
j elude paratroopers.
The "stand by" orders were
I flashed from Army headquarters
here during the night, apparently
after Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur
' specified the numbers and types of
j troops he will need.
It was the first time since out
! break of the Korean fighting that
major Army reinforcements were
put on "the ready" for movement to
the Far East. Air Force, Navy, and
Marine units already are en route
or standing by for transport.
Even as the full-fledged expedi-

tionary force assembled, the Armed
Services began a limited mobiliza
tion of reserves on a voluntary
basis. In addition, draft calls under
the newly reactivated Selective
Service machinery are deemed
likely within 10 days, unless there
is a big upsurge in voluntary en
listmens.
Military spokesmen revealed the
Army alerts at a "briefing" session
but refused, on security grounds,
to designate any units except the
infantry division.
The division, commanded by Maj.
Gen. Laurence Bolton Keiser, was
ordered to prepare for movement
"in the near future."
Parts of the First Marine Division
and First Marine Air Wing already
are awaiting movement from the
West Coast.
Also alerted from the Sixth Army
Area, which has its headquarters in
San Francisco, were two units of
anti - aircraft artillery and other
"supporting units" which were not
further described.
The Second Army has headquar
terms at Fort Meade, Md„ the Third
Army at Fort McPherson, Atlanta,
Ga., and the Fourth Army at Fort
Sam Houston, Texas.
