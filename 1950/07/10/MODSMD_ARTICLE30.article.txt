# ‘Red Meadows' Rates As Top-Flight War Thriller
## 
### AL BERRY 
"Red Meadows,' a Danish flicture j
now at the Guild Theater, is one of
the best war-underground thrillers
to come out of the last war. Intel
ligent direction, which could have, ,
but didn't, ham up a now shop- I
worn general plot, and excellent
acting make this movie one of the |
best celluloid experiences to play in
the Bay Area in some time.
The plot, realistically done by the 1
people who should know best what
„ „n «i ..i

it was all about,
deals with the
fierce Danish
underground ac
tivities in the
dark days of the
Nazi occupation.
The chief char
acter, whose
name escapes us

uauic ua
at the moment, is one of the Danish
underground leaders. He is captured
by the Germans after a somewhat
destructive, but very exciting, se
quence which results in the blow
ing up of an aircraft factory and
lots of bang-bang action.
In the hands of the Germans, the
hero shows a distinct dislike for be
ing tortured and even more for be- j
ing shot, but the Nazis make un
pleasant overtures at both. The j
flick winds up nicely and satisfac- i
torily with a burst of action and

I a great fade-away bit of photogra
| phy
"Meadows' lacks the brilliant
; brutality which characterized the
Italians' "Open City,' and is not
quite as good a movie, but it is
■ filmed with a great deal of imagina
| tion and owns an air of stark real
; ity that distinguishes it as out
! standing as compared with most of
the lukewarm Hollywood replicas.
"Satin Slippers," the companion
"feature,' is a March-of-Time-like
documentary on the birth and rise
of the Australian ballet. If you are
either Australian or a ballet-bug
this section of the bill could be the
highlight of the evening. If you
. happen to be neither. "Satin Slip
| pers" is at worst painless and easy
; to watch, but not particularly ex-
I citing.
