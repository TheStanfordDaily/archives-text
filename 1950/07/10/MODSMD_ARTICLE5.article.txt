TOKYO, Monday, July 10 (UP) —A "lost" battalion of American,
infantry has fought its way out of a Communist trap near Chonan
and rejoined other American forces, Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur
announced today.
The escape of the American troops from behind the North Kc-

rean battle line was announced in
Mac Arthur's communique.
Fighting against odds of more
than 10 to 1, the battalion of be-"
tween 800 and 1,000 troops cut its
way through the enemy to reach
other elements of the regiment, the
communique said.
The battalion was in "good con-

dition" after its "bold operation,"
Mac Arthur said.
In reporting one of the most spec
tacular operations of the Korean
war, the communique said:
"A battalion of an American i-egi
ment in a forward location which
was reported to have been trapped
by encirclement near Chonan on the
night of July 8-9, cut its way
through the enemy, North Korean
first division, with overwhelming
112 predominance in strength and ar
mament in a ratio of more than II)
to one, and has rejoined other ele
ments of its regiment in good con
dition. In this boljl operation the
battalion fought a most successful
holding and delaying and rearguard,
action."
The battalion was one of two
which fought an all-night battle in
Chonan Friday before withdrawing
early Saturday after 20 hours o£
holding off the larger force of ad
vancing Communists driving toward
the South Korean provisional capi
tal of Taejon, 36 miles to the south.
Mac Arthur announced yesterday
that the initial effort to relieve the
battalion had been unsuccessful and
his communique earlier today had
been ominously silent about the fate
of these troops.
The communique announcing the
good news of the battalion's suc
cessful operation followed by a few
hours other heartening news from
the Chonan front — that American
ground and air forces had teamed
up to stall the Communist drive in
that area.
