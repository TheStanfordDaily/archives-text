# No Korean Blank Chit Says Senate

### 
WASHINGTON. July 9 (UP) â€”
The Senate Appropriations Com
mittee has refused a Defense De
partment request for "blank chock"
power to finance the Korean war
and has asked instead for precise
estimates of its money needs, it was
revealed today.
Committee members said they
had told Defense Secretary Louis
Johnson that when military plan
ners produce the estimates they will
be acted on promptly, even though
Congress must be recalled from its
summer recess to do so.
Johnson's major obstacles are the
uncertainty of the length of the
Korean war, what it will take to
win it, and how much it will cost
lo carry out President Truman's
orders to draft men to build the
Army, Navy, and Air Corps to their
authorized strength.
Chairman Walter F. George, D..
Ga., of the Senate Finance Commit
tee, whose estimates on federal
spending and tax plans usually are
sound, predicted the war would cost
$5,000,000,000 over and above budg
eted military spending for the cur
rent fiscal year.
If American intervention on a
larger scale is required, he said, the
cost might be $10,000,000,000.
Chairman Robert A. Taft, R., of
the Senate Republican policy com
mittee, meantime denied reports he
had announced support for a $1,-
000,000.000 increase in military
spending to insure Korean victory.
Taft said he believes the Defense
Department should promptly be
given "whatever financial support"
is necessary for the war effort, but
that he has "no idea how much" will
be required and that he has sug
gested no figure.
