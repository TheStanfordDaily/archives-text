## Policy Change Needed 
### 
The attack on South Korea 16 days ago by Russian-sponsored
Communist armies from North Korea has led many arm-chair dip
lomats and Cellar coffee drinkers to condemn President Truman
and his staff for a lack of awareness and a poor intelligence serv
ice in the Korean area.
No doubt about it, we were caught napping. The news came
through to Washington on a weekend when most of the staff was
off duty and the President was in Missouri.
Why this surprise attack? Certainly we must have had some
idea that the Reds were massing troops just above the 38th par
allel
There are two explanations for this. Not excuses, as it is impos
sible to excuse the United States for a blunder of this degree in
the tense and nervous world today. After all that has happened
in the past few years, we certainly should have been on the look
out for almost anything to break. But, apparently, the President
and his adviser, did and still do believe that:
1. Russia is not ready for a general war, does not want a general
war, but will do everything short of a general war to confuse and
worry the United States.
2. The Reds, when faced by American troops, would pull back
to their original positions and bide their time.
Both these assumptions seem to have gone by the board.
From front line reports, we have every reason in the world to
believe that Russian-trained officers are commanding the North
Korean troops, and that the Kremlin is directing the strategy of
the Red attack. What we don't know is whether or not there are
actual Russian troops among the North Korean forces.
And Russia is showing no inclination to pull back to the 38th
parallel and wait for a more advantageous time. At the moment,
it seems as if this is the advantageous time for the Red armies. Our
men are being forced back on all fronts, and it is going to be a
long, hard pull before U.S. forces see the border of North Korea
again.
The assumptions voiced by the President slightly over two
weeks ago are outdated today. Isn't it time to change our policy
slightly and take a more realistic view of the situation—the view
that this "local" incident might, and very possibly could, be the
first battle of World War III?
