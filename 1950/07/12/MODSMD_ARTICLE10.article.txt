In order to be perfectly fair and give both sides of the sponsor
question, we would like to print the folowing letter received yes
terday irom ASSU President Downing McKee:
To the Editor:
After spending a couple of hours with my Webster's Un
abridged, Funk and Wagnall's New Comprehensive Standard,
•and Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms, I finally conquered the
letter entitled "Benevolent Autocracy" that appeared in the July
10 edition of The Daily. After breaking down all of the $64 words
into monosyllables, I have come to the conclusion that the "ridicu
lous system of autocracy here known as 'sponsoring' " should be
explained and clarified.
May I nake it clear at this point that I am not defending any one
individual or individuals as such; I am attempting to explain, and
defend the sponsoring system as it is used at Stanford, and the
women that have been chosen by us to act as sponsors.
Women who are chosen for the job of sponsor are appointed by
a committee consisting of at least the president of AWS, chairman
of Women's Council, head sponsor of each freshman dormitory
unit, ASSU vice-president, president-elect of AWS, and senior
president ol the freshman dormitories. If this committee does not
include four members with previous sponsoring experience, the
head of the committee should appoint ex-sponsors to serve on the
committee.
It should be fairly obvious, from the above statement, that much
time and effort is spent in selecting junior and senior women to
act as sponsors. They are carefully screened and selected by this
committee to handle a difficult job. It is the job of these women
to present the "whole picture" to the freshmen with whom they
work, and then advise them from there. The gals aren't perfect —
they may make a few mistakes, granted—but they have a difficult
|ob to do nnd are doing it well.
During this summer quarter, we have approximately 70 fresh
man women and 30 sophomore and junior women transfers who
are her- to make their grades so that they may re-enroll at Stan
;ord, winter quarter 1951. They came to summer school with this
in mind, and the help that they may receive from their sponsors,
•ii avoidina some of the pitfalls they encounter, may aid them in
achieving their goal.
li seems too bad that some people have taken it upon themselves
to run down the whole sponsoring system, when in reality it looks
as if the/ have an "axe to grind" with one or two individuals. If
those who wrote the article would choose to present some con
crete suggestions as to ways the sponsoring system may be im
proved I would be glad to see them in my office. Until then, the
sponsoiing system marches on.

•and Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms, I finally conquered the
letter entitled "Benevolent Autocracy" that appeared in the July
10 edition of The Daily. After breaking down all of the $64 words
into monosyllables, I have come to the conclusion that the "ridicu
lous system of autocracy here known as 'sponsoring' " should be
explained and clarified.
May I nake it clear at this point that I am not defending any one
individual or individuals as such; I am attempting to explain, and
defend the sponsoring system as it is used at Stanford, and the
women that have been chosen by us to act as sponsors.
Women who are chosen for the job of sponsor are appointed by
a committee consisting of at least the president of AWS, chairman
of Women's Council, head sponsor of each freshman dormitory
unit, ASSU vice-president, president-elect of AWS, and senior
president ol the freshman dormitories. If this committee does not
include four members with previous sponsoring experience, the
head of the committee should appoint ex-sponsors to serve on the
committee.
It should be fairly obvious, from the above statement, that much
time and effort is spent in selecting junior and senior women to
act as sponsors. They are carefully screened and selected by this
committee to handle a difficult job. It is the job of these women
to present the "whole picture" to the freshmen with whom they
work, and then advise them from there. The gals aren't perfect —
they may make a few mistakes, granted—but they have a difficult
|ob to do nnd are doing it well.
During this summer quarter, we have approximately 70 fresh
man women and 30 sophomore and junior women transfers who
are her- to make their grades so that they may re-enroll at Stan
;ord, winter quarter 1951. They came to summer school with this
in mind, and the help that they may receive from their sponsors,
•ii avoidina some of the pitfalls they encounter, may aid them in
achieving their goal.
li seems too bad that some people have taken it upon themselves
to run down the whole sponsoring system, when in reality it looks
as if the/ have an "axe to grind" with one or two individuals. If
those who wrote the article would choose to present some con
crete suggestions as to ways the sponsoring system may be im
proved I would be glad to see them in my office. Until then, the
sponsoiing system marches on.

In order to be perfectly fair and give both sides of the sponsor
question, we would like to print the folowing letter received yes
terday irom ASSU President Downing McKee:
