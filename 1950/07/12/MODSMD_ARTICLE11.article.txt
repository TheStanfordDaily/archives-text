## History—1950

Is the elusive, irrepressible Kilroy back on active global duty?
According to a story from an American air base in Japan, this übiqui
tous legendary veteran of World War II has again put in a word, if not
!lis appe.ua> ce as Uncle Sam's Korea-bound fighters are departing for
combat duty.
Takii g uu where he left off after defeat of the Axis, the Kilroy of today
had the last laugh after a wall scribbler at the Japanese embarkation base
claimed to be the first there. '"Sorry to spoil your little joke," went Kil
roy's latesi rhyming riposte; "I was here, but my pencil broke."
The impudent announcement that ' Kilroy was here" (always before
anyone el>et decorated walls and any other handy surface, from Hitler's
'Eagle Nes'" at lofty Berchtesgaden to the depths of volcanic craters of
the Pacific. One intrepid prankster scrambled several hundred feet down
into a de* j p, sheer-walled pit near Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. With con
veniently loose stones at hand, he spelled out on the polished lava floor
){ the craier the eloquent word "Kilroy."
Hundreds have claimed authorship of this character, but whatever the
source of the play, Kilroy-isms have spread over much of the world, from
Vatal, Brazil, 1o Karachi, Pakistan. In the Aleutians and Africa, in Eng
land, Italy, Australia, the Philippines, and no one knows how many other
unexpected places, the mark of Kilroy has become a symbol of the speed
and scopi- of today's global warfare.
Among the assorted spots from which some Kilroy phrase has been
reported are 'he Capitol dome in Washington, the Statue of Liberty, and
•he guinea pig battleship Pennsylvania in which the words were found
after it was blasted by the atomic bomb at Bikini.
