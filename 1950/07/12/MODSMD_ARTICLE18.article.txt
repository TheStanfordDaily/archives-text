# THE 						ALL-STAR GAME:
## Kiner, Schoendienst Homer As Nats Beat Americans In 14 
### 
CHICAGO, July 11 (UP) —The National League used an Ameri
can League specialty, the home run, for its own purpose today as
Red Schoendienst belted a game-winning four-bagger in the 14th
inning for its fifth triumph in 17 all-star games, 4 to 3.
Playing before a record-money house of 46,127 in Comiskey

Park, birthplace of the game, the
Nationals came back into the strug
gle only in the ninth inning when
Pittsburgh's Ralph Kiner slapped
his second hit in three years of
all-star play.
But that was the game - tying
home run and it set up the winning
circuit smash by Schoendienst, St.
Louis Cardinal second baseman in
the first extra-inning contest in the
history of the classic.
Until Kiner's drive, which soared
into the upper deck in left field only
a few feet from where Schoen
dienst's blast landed, it had ap
peared that the American League
would garner its 13th triumph in

the mid-season "dream game."
But Kiner, who has hit 24 home
runs in the National League season,
gave the senior circuit its chance
and stellar hurling by the New
York Giants' Larry J an sen and the
Cincinnati Reds' Ewell Blackwell.

the Athletics but then he got Joe
DiMaggio, one of the game's great

the classic, it would have to be Jan

went three innings, was the winning

tablished in 1935 by the American
League's. Lefty Gomez.
The right - handed Giant hurler
handcuffed the top American
League §tars, granting only one hit
and no walks and striking out six
men. Blackwell likewise gave up
only one hit and no walks while
fanning two.
These two were the mainstays for
the- victorious National Leaguers,
managed to their first win since 1944
by Brooklyn's Burt Shotton. And
the pair easily hung up the best
pitching records in the game.
Ted Gray, Detroit southpaw, was
the losing pitcher.
Over the 14 innings the Nationals
connected for 10 hits while the
American League collected eight.
The crowd paid a record gate of
$126,109.51 to see the game, sur
passing the previous mark of $105.-
314.90 set in 1947 at the Cubs' park,
Wrigley Field, and it was likely a
new record sum would go to the
players' pension fund in net re
ceipts.
Baseball's top celebrities attended
the classic, headed by Commissioner
A. B. "Happy" Chandler. But the
game was played to honor one of
the game's greatest figures, 87-year
old Connie Mack, founder of the
Philadelphia Athletics.

CHICAGO, July 11 (UP) —The National League used an Ameri
can League specialty, the home run, for its own purpose today as
Red Schoendienst belted a game-winning four-bagger in the 14th
inning for its fifth triumph in 17 all-star games, 4 to 3.
Playing before a record-money house of 46,127 in Comiskey

Park, birthplace of the game, the
Nationals came back into the strug
gle only in the ninth inning when
Pittsburgh's Ralph Kiner slapped
his second hit in three years of
all-star play.
But that was the game - tying
home run and it set up the winning
circuit smash by Schoendienst, St.
Louis Cardinal second baseman in
the first extra-inning contest in the
history of the classic.
Until Kiner's drive, which soared
into the upper deck in left field only
a few feet from where Schoen
dienst's blast landed, it had ap
peared that the American League
would garner its 13th triumph in

the mid-season "dream game."
But Kiner, who has hit 24 home
runs in the National League season,
gave the senior circuit its chance
and stellar hurling by the New
York Giants' Larry J an sen and the
Cincinnati Reds' Ewell Blackwell.
