# MITRI FIGHT
## 
### 
Handsome young Tiberio Mitri oÂ£
Italy, Europe's best middleweight,
will try to wrest the world cham
pionship from unpopular Jake La-
Motta of New York in a "strike
breaker" 15-round bout at Madi

Most fans were hoping that un
beaten Mitri would win the title on
his 24th birthday.
