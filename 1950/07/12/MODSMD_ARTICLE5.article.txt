# Red Army Pushes Back U.S. Infantry; Draft Machinery Oiled for Operation
## Set September 30 Deadline To Fill Induction Quotas 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 11 (UP)—Selective Serv
ice headquarters today fixed state quotas for the
drafting of 20,000 men and ordered local boards
to start the inductees moving to Army camps "no
later than September 30."
Responding swiftly to a manpower call issued

Monday by the Army, Draft Direc—f
tor Maj. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey sent
telegrams to 54 state and territorial
directors advising each of his quota.
He said it would be up to each
state director to announce his quota,
the procedure followed in the World
War II draft.
Hershey wired that inductions
should begin "as soon as possible."
Hershey said Monday it would
take "at least 60 days" to get the
draft machinery operating because
it is rusty from disuse. No one has !
been inducted since January, 1949.
Those called to induction stations |
are allowed to return home after
taking their physical. They are no- '
tified in 10 days whether or not they j
are acceptable to the Army.
If they are ruled fit, registrants \
can be ordered inducted within 21 j
days. They have 10 days in which [
to file an appeal with their local I
board. If turned down, they can 1
carry their case to appeal board {
panels in San Francisco and Los j
Angeles.
Registrants in high school will be j
permitted to continue in school if |
they will be graduated before their
20th birthday. Students in college
can be deferred until the end of the
academic year. However, since J
summer sessions do not count to- |
ward deferment, all otherwise eli- |
gible college students are subject to !
the draft.

Santa Clara County Selective
Service headquarters yesterday took
over additional space in the Bank
of America Building, San Jose, as
the job of reclassifying draft - eli
gible young men began.
There are nearly 32.000 regis
trants between the ages of 18 and
2G on county draft rolls, Mrs. Lil
lian Krigbuam, draft co-ordinator,
said. However, many of these are
veterans or men in a deferred sta
tus.
The draft office has been swamped
with telephone calls from regis
trants since President Truman's
draft order Saturday. Most regis
trants wished to notify the board of
address changes, Mrs. Krigbaum
said.
She pointed out, however, that
such changes must be made in writ
ing to the local board. The office
has been authorized to increase its
staff to six persons to handle this
work, she said.

tor Maj. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey sent
telegrams to 54 state and territorial
directors advising each of his quota.
He said it would be up to each
state director to announce his quota,
the procedure followed in the World
War II draft.
Hershey wired that inductions
should begin "as soon as possible."
Hershey said Monday it would
take "at least 60 days" to get the
draft machinery operating because
it is rusty from disuse. No one has !
been inducted since January, 1949.
Those called to induction stations |
are allowed to return home after
taking their physical. They are no- '
tified in 10 days whether or not they j
are acceptable to the Army.
If they are ruled fit, registrants \
can be ordered inducted within 21 j
days. They have 10 days in which [
to file an appeal with their local I
board. If turned down, they can 1
carry their case to appeal board {
panels in San Francisco and Los j
Angeles.
Registrants in high school will be j
permitted to continue in school if |
they will be graduated before their
20th birthday. Students in college
can be deferred until the end of the
academic year. However, since J
summer sessions do not count to- |
ward deferment, all otherwise eli- |
gible college students are subject to !
the draft.

Santa Clara County Selective
Service headquarters yesterday took
over additional space in the Bank
of America Building, San Jose, as
the job of reclassifying draft - eli
gible young men began.
There are nearly 32.000 regis
trants between the ages of 18 and
2G on county draft rolls, Mrs. Lil
lian Krigbuam, draft co-ordinator,
said. However, many of these are
veterans or men in a deferred sta
tus.
The draft office has been swamped
with telephone calls from regis
trants since President Truman's
draft order Saturday. Most regis
trants wished to notify the board of
address changes, Mrs. Krigbaum
said.
She pointed out, however, that
such changes must be made in writ
ing to the local board. The office
has been authorized to increase its
staff to six persons to handle this
work, she said.
