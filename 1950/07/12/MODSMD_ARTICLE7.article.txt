# New Play Spotlights Artists-in-Residence
## 
### 
The second play of the Stanford
Players' stock company season of
four productions opens tonight with
the presentation of Alexander
Greendale's "A Storm, A Tiger."
In late autumn of 194(3, the presi
i dent of Stanford announced the cre
ation of the Junior Artist-in-Resi
j dence policy as a distinct innovation
I in theatrical education in the De
; partmer.t of Speech and Drama.
This policy was created to give
young professionals or high-caliber
amateurs the opportunity to enlarge
their talents through graduate study
I and through varied experience with
' the Stanford Players.
In addition to such support of
! qualified actors, costumers, stage
designers, and technicians, the Play
i ers have maintained a policy of
stimulating interest in new play
; wrUhts through the production, of

such new plays as may be ready for
an audience test.
The production of Alexander
Greendale's "A Storm, A Tiger" is a
result of the new plays policy. In
this production, as in all produc
tions of the summer season, Junior
Artists-in-Residence join the regu
lar company and technical staff of
the Stanford Players.
This year's national competition
for the Junior Artist-in-Residence
fellowship resulted in three awards.
Two of these were awarded in the
technical field to designer - techni
cians Charles Lamh and Marvin
Chomsky. The third was awarded
to Seymour Tuchow, actor. Lamb
i appears as construction technician
of the production of "A Storm. A
! Tiger," while Tuchow carries the
j demanding assignment of the role of
, Russell Steele.
Alexander GreenJale, uithor of

the play, is known to audiences of
both East and West Coasts. His
"Walk Into My Parlor" played on
Broadway in the season of 1941-42.
His "Build No Fence Around Me,"
which starred Jane Darwell, pro
vided a comedy highlight of the
Players' 1948-49 season.
Greendale has been a Stanford
Creative Writing Fellow and was
awarded the Master of Arts degree
in the Department of Speech and
Drama. Unlike "Build No Fence
Around Me," his "A Storm, A Ti
ger" is serious in form and does not
employ the conventional three-act
structure.
Exploiting the facility of an un
usual production, Greendale ex
plores an ever-controversial theme.
In ten scenes, adroitly montnged,
he tells his story of the hope for
justice in America today.
