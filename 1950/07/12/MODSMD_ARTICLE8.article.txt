- WITH AMERICANS IN SOUTH KOREA, July
11 (UP) —American troops were staggered today
by a licking from crack, well-eguipped North
Korean soldiers wearing Communist red stars
over their hearts.
The Gl's gave everything they had to their

battle against tanks, rifles, and ma
chineguns. For the little ground that
was wrested from them, they
charged a huge price in Communist
blood—and lost plenty of their own
men.
There were only 30 soldiers left
out of an American company of 148
which left Japan two weeks ago.
Less than 20 per cent of the wound
ed were being evacuated. All but
two American tanks were knocked
out. One had only one round of
ammunition left.
Green-clad Communists drove at
the Americans with everything they
had. They had plenty. Their tank
supply seemed to be endless. As
soon as one was knocked out, an
other lumbered up in its place.
Many had excellent Russian-made
rifles. Their machinegun fire was
relentless.
Even the weather was on the side
of the Communists. A dense fog
lowered onto the battlefield. When
it rose. North Koreans had infil
trated American lines and attacked
many Gl's from the rear.
Lt. Junior H. Childer, 540 Madeira
Avenue, San Jose, Calif., led the
battered remnants of his company
out through a corridor of enemy
sniper and machinegun fire. Only
30 of his men were left.
Watching the retreat was a ghast
ly sight. Men who only a few hours
before had been fresh, eager, joking
youngsters came back wet and
filthy from crawling thi-ough rice
paddies. Their eyes were bloodshot
and their legs were like rubber.
Thy helped each other as they
staggered to the command post, only
to find out they must stagger far
ther, because it is moving day again
for the Americans.
