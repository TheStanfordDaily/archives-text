## Yanks Smash First Kum Crossing by Red Armies 
### 
TOKYO, Friday, July 14 (UP) —North Korean Communists made
their first attempt to cross the Kum River today but were beaten
back by tons of shells from American artillery.
The North Koreans, who had massed two divisions on the river's
north bank, made three tries at sending strong patrols across the

river during the pre-dawn dark- 4
riess, a front dispatch reported.
Heavy fire from the U.S. defend
ers deefated the Communist at- '
tempts to get a foothold on the j
south bank, but a few North Ko
reans succeeded in reaching the
American - held side of the river,
front commanders said.
There was no indication in the i
front reports whether those who j
did reach the American side of the
Kum were liquidated by the U.S. j
forces immediately.
The frontal move on the Ameri- |
can defense line protecting the
temporary South Korean capital of
Taejon came as Communist flanking |
maneuvers also threatened the U.S. j
forces, and guex - rillas harassed them
from behind.
A dispatch from Robert Miller. !
United Press correspondent with
the Americans at the front, told of
the fanatical North Korean effort
to ford the Kum.
Tha first North Korean attack
came at 4:15 a.m. when a' strong
patrol rushed out on a quarter- j
tr.iie-long bridge which had beer,
blown up by American demolition
crews."' Miller leported.
The North Koreans threw them
selves into the water and attempted
to swim to the American side.
"'The Yanks threw down heavy
mortar and machinegun fire and
liquidated practically the entire
patrol. Two other attempts were
made to push infiltrating patrols
across the Kum. Front command
ers said both were detected and
only a few Communists succeeded
in reaching the south bank."
Miller's dispatch said the object
of the Communist patrol action was j
to establish a "bridgehead" on the j
American side.
In addition to firing at the river !
patrols throughout the rainy night,
the American artillery pounded im
portant road junctions and positions
behind the enemy lines on the north
bank of the 200 - yard - wide river,
where the Americans are making a
stand 12 miles north of Taejon.
The artillery caught two North
Korean tanks and set them afire,
while shells from enemy tanks !
boomed into the American position
on the river bank.

There was no indication in the i
front reports whether those who j
did reach the American side of the
Kum were liquidated by the U.S. j
forces immediately.
The frontal move on the Ameri- |
can defense line protecting the
temporary South Korean capital of
Taejon came as Communist flanking |
maneuvers also threatened the U.S. j
forces, and guex - rillas harassed them
from behind.
A dispatch from Robert Miller. !
United Press correspondent with
the Americans at the front, told of
the fanatical North Korean effort
to ford the Kum.
Tha first North Korean attack
came at 4:15 a.m. when a' strong
patrol rushed out on a quarter- j
tr.iie-long bridge which had beer,
blown up by American demolition
crews."' Miller leported.
The North Koreans threw them
selves into the water and attempted
to swim to the American side.
"'The Yanks threw down heavy
mortar and machinegun fire and
liquidated practically the entire
patrol. Two other attempts were
made to push infiltrating patrols
across the Kum. Front command
ers said both were detected and
only a few Communists succeeded
in reaching the south bank."
Miller's dispatch said the object
of the Communist patrol action was j
to establish a "bridgehead" on the j
American side.
In addition to firing at the river !
patrols throughout the rainy night,
the American artillery pounded im
portant road junctions and positions
behind the enemy lines on the north
bank of the 200 - yard - wide river,
where the Americans are making a
stand 12 miles north of Taejon.
The artillery caught two North
Korean tanks and set them afire,
while shells from enemy tanks !
boomed into the American position
on the river bank.
