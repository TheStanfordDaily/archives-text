WASHINGTON, July 13 (UP) — President Truman said today
American forces never have taken a beating, and aren't goincj to
do it in South Korea.
He said he is sure Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's troops will halt the
North Korean Communists and drive them back behind their own

borders.
He told his weekly press confer
ence he is considering a report to
Congress and the public on the Ko
rean situation.
His confident appraisal of war de
velopments was voiced after he had
met with his National Security
Council. The Council is the na
tion's top strategy group.
A reporter asked Mr. Truman if
he could assure the American peo
ple "that we arfe not getting the
tar kicked out of us in Korea."
He replied in a firm voice that it
never has happened to us, and it
won't this time.
He then was asked if he is sure
American ground forces will be able
to maintain a foothold in South Ko
rea, where they have been steadily
pushed back.
He replied sharply that our
troops will maintain a foothold ex
tending all the way up to the 38th
parallel — the boundary between
North and South Korea.
Asked whether American troops
would push beyond the 38th paral
lel to attack the Reds on their home
grounds, he said quietly that he
would make that decision when
necessary.
In response to other questions,
Mi 1 . Truman confirmed that he soon
will ask Congress for extra defense
funds. But he said he could not
even estimate the amount now be
cause the figures are still being as
sembled.
He also confirmed that a partial
mobilization of the National Guard
and organized reserves is under
consideration but no firm decision
has been reached.
On the overall world picture, he

said he remains hopelut. and that
he still considers the Korean fight
ing a police action instead of a full
fledged war.
A reporter noted that many
Americans are concerned about the
danger of Communist attacks in
other parts of the world. He asked
if this country is "prepared to re
sist aggression everywhere."
We will have to meet situations
as they will develop, Mr. Truman,
replied calmly.


PRESIDENT TRUMAN
