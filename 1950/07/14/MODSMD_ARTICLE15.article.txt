WITH AMERICANS ON THE
KUM RIVER FRONT, Korea, July
13 (UP) —Fifteen North Korean re
connaissance men probing near the
American lines were routed today
by a surprise artillery barrage.
The Communist patrol, apparent
ly trying to test the new American
defense line on the Kum River,
came out of the woods directly
..cross the river from an American
position. They could be seen clear
ly as they walked to the recently
v estroyed Kum River bridge.
Apparently they were searching
for anti-tank mines. They closely
examined the ground ahead of
them. One, who seemed to be an
officer, surveyed American posi
tions with his field glasses, while
the Gl's just watched.
The Communists were just be
yond the reach of American rifle
r.nd machinegun fire — and they
itnew it.
But they forgot about American
■ rtillery. An urgent mission with a
request for gunfire was sent back
from the forward observatoin post.

That brought artillery shells.
The sound of the guns going off
could be heard several seconds be
fox'e the shells arrived. Americans
watched with fascination as the
Communists moseyed around on the
far shore, knowing the shells were
aimed at them.
There was a puff of black smoke
just to the right of the little group.
They split up into smaller groups
and fanned out. Each man sought
the nearest shelter.
One stumbled and fell. He got up
and scrambled over an embankment
just as a shell headed for him.
What a few seconds before had
been a confident military unit car
rying out an assignment suddenly
became a group of frightened indi
viduals with only one idea in mind
—to get back to safety and away
from the blast that shook the
ground under their fee*.
Two more artillery rounds were
fired at the patrol. It was impos
sible to see the effects, as the North
Koreans were out of sight, burrow
ing and crawling through the wood
ed hills.
