AN AIR BASE IN JAPAN, July
13 (UP) —Fifty B-29 Super-Fort
resses splattered a Communist rail
road center in North Korea with 500
tons of bombs today in the greatest
precision bombing raid since World
War 11.
Maj. Gen. Emmett (Rosy) O'Don
nell, who led the first war-time
B-29 raid on Japan, directed today's
mission.
Russell Brines, who reported the
attack as a representative of the
combined American press, said that
the planes and their youthful crews
met no opposition on the daylight
raid. He said that the mist and rain
were so thick that radar was used
to sight the target.
One of the Superfortresses t had
operational trouble returning to its
base and its crew was forced to bail
out over water between Korea and
Japan. At the same time it was
revealed that Communist fighter
planes knocked down a B-29 yes
terday—the first lost to enemy ac
tion in this war.
