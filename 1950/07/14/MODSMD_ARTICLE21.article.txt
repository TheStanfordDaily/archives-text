# Lawyer Spaeth Youngest Dean
## 
### 
At 44. Dean Carl B. Spaeth of the
Law School is Stanford's youngest
academic dean. Attracted to Stan
lord from the field of international
affairs in 1948, Dean Spaeth has
guided the school through its recent
period of expansion.
Since his graduation from law
school in 1933, Dean Spaeth's career
has been divided between legal ed
ucation and work in international
affairs. The Dean said, "At the very
time that I was offered the wonder
ful opportunity at Stanford, I was
seriously considering entering the
career of foreign service."
His administration work at Stan
ford has been a 12-month job. In
the recent expansion period, his du
ties have largely been concerned
with getting new programs started.
Now he is al?o teaching two courses
in the Law School.
When all the rest of his work is
done, Dean Spaeth is usually found
puttering on the golf course. "At
golf," he says,"I am a fantastic fa
natic. My son started to play at
the age of eight; and I've got my
daughter started; but my wife, who
was born in Scotland, prefers to get
her exercise in the garden."
