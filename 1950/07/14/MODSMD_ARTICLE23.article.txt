# Gleaming New Law School loses From Old Sandstone
## 
### 
Out of the shell of the old
Stanford Administration Build
ing—outdated, rangy, and inad
equate —the San Francisco firm
of Wagner and Martinez has
constructed a gleaming new

home for the Stanford School ci
Law, "probably the most attrac
tive and comfortable law school
j in the country."
In this recently completed $950,000
building, say Law School officials,
| the school can operate more effi
| ciently than ever before in its 57-
year history,
In place of three small, over
crowded buiidings on the Inner
Quad, the professors and budding
lawyers now have ample space in a
structure built around their needs.
The reconstruction job began in
the fall of 1948. Down went the
stained glass windows, the skylight
| above the high lobby, the circular
' marble staircases, the small mezza
nine that gave the building only
one and a half floors. In their placc,
J within the familiar sandstone walls,
: rose a functional, modern five-
I story structure. Architects were
j Weihe, Flick, and Kruse of San
Francisco.
I Professors began to move into the
j new building in February of this
| year. The realistic moot court room
: saw action in January and classes
I commenced there last quarter.
The latest materials and methods
I of construction were used through-
I out, said Seraphim F. Post, admin
| istrative assistant in the University
Business Office. Law students and
| faculty walk on floors of linoleum
or asphalt tile. Above their heads
J is sound - resistant acoustical plas
i ter. They read by fluorescent light—
i ing.
One hundred fifty students can
occupy the main lecture room on
the first floor. Built like an amphi
theater, its long, curving desks form
a sloping semicircle. Another simi
lar room on the third floor holds 109
students.
The county courtroom will be
nothing new to students of the Law
j School, who are now able to ha
rangue in the large Moot Court
! room on the third floor. It is com
plete with judge's bench, witness
chair, counsel tables, jury box. and
| spectator seats.
Future barristers now study in
three well-lighted reading rooms on
the third floor. The largest, fined
with bookcases, stretches across the
entire front of the building. Two
smaller rooms face toward the In
ner Quad.
Rising through the center of the
; top three levels are the Law School
; library stacks, with space for a
quarter of a million volumes.
Though the school now possesses
j "only" 60.000 books, library expan
! sion is on the agenda.
Most of the law faculty, who now
| have space to spread out their
j briefs, occupy offices on the fourth
floor. Also on this floor is the book
i lined faculty library and confer
ence room. Dr. Carl B. Spaeth,
Dean of the School of Law, presides
| over a suite of offices on the first
floor.
In the basement are a mimeo
graphing, shipping, and receiving
room, a typing room, a brightly
colored lounge, men's and women's
locker rooms, a kitchen, and library
vaults.
Aside from classrooms and the
dean's offices, the first floor provides
a seminar room, offices for the Law
Association and the Moot Court
Board, and some faculty offices.
On the second floor are the offices
of the Law Review.
"They've brought the good parts
of the modern into the good parts
j of the old,' said Post, pointing to the
up-to-date structure wihin tradi
tional snndstone walls.
