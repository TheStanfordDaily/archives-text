# 2 New Men Strengthen Law Faculty
## 
### 
A top-notch faculty has long
been the chief selling point of
the Stanford Law School. New
buildings may be few and far
between, officials say, but the
quality of the faculty has been
and will continue to remain
high.
In line with this ideal and acting
as an integral part of the Stanford
Law School Plan, two top profes
sors were added to the faculty ros
ter this year.
Professor Harold Shepherd, who
left a dean's job at Duke to return
to his alma mater, and Professor
Sylvester Garrett, previously a la
bor relations co-ordinator for two
Eastern glass companies, are the
new appointees.
Dr. Shepherd is described by Dean
Carl B. Spaeth of the Law School as
one of the nation's leaders in the
field of legal relations and the law
of contracts.
Graduated from Stanford in 1919
and a teacher here from 1923 to
1930. Professor Shepherd has been
engaged this year in the teaching of
contracts and equity. In all his
classes he has received the highest
praise from his students.
A practical expert in the fields of
labor law and labor relatoins, the
second addition, Dr. Sylvester Gar
rett, has been labeled by Dean
Spaeth "one of the best men in the
country in (his) area of study . . ."
Professor Garrett was a war-time
member of the NLRB and OPA af
ter serving as a professor at the
University of Pennsylvania. Fol
lowing the war, he became associ
ated with the Libbey-Owens-Ford
Glass Company and the Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Company, his last job
before coming to Stanford last Sep

As a labor relations co-ordinator
for the glass companies, Dr. Garrett
dealt in bargaining conferences with
labor unions representing as many
as 20,000 men. He is teaching labor
law and collective bargaining class
es at Stanford.
The two new professors have
joined a staff which Dean Spaeth
has defined as one "seeking to
maintain, and by constant test keep
strong, the highest standards of
teaching and scholarship."
