It would have cost over twice as
much to erect a new building for
the Stanford Law School as it did to
remodel the old Administration
Building, according to Eldridge T.
Spencer, University director of
planning.
Approximate cost of the com
pleted reconstruction job is $950.-
000. Spencer guessed that it would
ave cost between $2,250,000 and
$2,500,000 to construct a new build
ing, with similar facilities, as had
previously been planned.
The construction job was financed
partly through a drive for funds,
begun in 1945, which brought in
$250,000 from, "friends and alumni
of the Law School." The remaining
cost, nearly $750,000, was .should
ered by the University.
The original contract was made in
July of 1948 with the San Francisco
linn of Wagner and Martinez for
$783,000. "We absorbed about $30.-
000 in change-overs after that," said
a spokesman for the company, "so
the University paid no more than
the original contract stipulated."
On top of that went furniture
costs, architects' fees, inspection
fees, and payments for such things
as installation of a fire-alarm sys
tem.
The fund-raising campaign that
resulted in the new building began
in December, 1945. In a publicity
brochure. Dr. Donald B. Tresidder,
then president of the University,
stated that "alumni, through the
Stanford Law Societies, have vol
untarily come forward to initiate a
program for the support of the
Stanford Law School."
The program was known as the

Stanford Law School Plan, and was
headed by Charles A. Beardsley of
Oakland. While the plan was ini
tiated by the alumni, said Dr. Tres
idder, its formulation had become a
! joint effort of alumni, Law School
| faculty, and administration.
The short-range goal was set at
$750,000, only $350,000 of which was
intended for the new building. The
program sought $250,000 to bring
more professors to the school. To
expand the library, $50,000 was
asked. An increase of $100,000 in
scholarships was needed.
A long - range goal of $4,000,000
was announced to provide for the
! "normal development of the school
as to faculty, equipment, library,
and students, as now estimated."
This money was to be gathered
through gifts, bequests, and endow
ments.
Funds began to roll in. By May
| 1946, $103,160 had been subscribed.
[Judge George E. Crothers of San
Francisco had donated an additional
; $125,000 for a law dormitory.
, The $783,000 contract made in 1948
| was far above the original esti
mate, but the fund - raising cam
paign continued.
From September to the first of
May, $108,000 had been donated,
said Dean Carl B. Spaeth. "This
sum includes in excess of $20,000
from alumni of the Law School," he
elaborated.
Fifty thousand dollars, from the
estate of William Nelson Cromwell,
was applied to the Cromwell Chair
of Law, set up last year. The re
maining $20,000 was given by Mrs.
Jennie Goodman for the Daniel M.
Goodman Memorial Fund, a schol-
I arship endowment.
