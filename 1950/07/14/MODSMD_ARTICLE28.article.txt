## 
### 
One of the most important phases i
of the Stanford Law School Plan is 1
its scholarship program.
In an effort to gain outstanding
students who lack the financial
means to come to Stanford, the
school itself, the University, and i
various alumni members have this
year realized $17,000 for scholar
ships.
Approximately $10,000 of this sum
has come from the University in the
form of grants-in-aid and entering

scholarships. This year, three $1,000
scholarships and seven $(500 schol
arships were handed out from this
fund to entering students.
At the present time, the Law
School itself offers 11 funded schol
arships, the annual amounts of
which are determined by the size of
the funds endowed and the incomes
received from them.
These scholarships are awarded to
students already in school and are

| given on a basis of grades and pe
| cuniary need.
. Probably the most interesting —
I and as yet untapped — source of
scholarship money is that which
comes from various law firms in the
state.
Members of these firms, who are
Law School alumni, have seen fit to
i donate, on a year-to-year basis,
varying amounts to be used for
scholarship purposes.
