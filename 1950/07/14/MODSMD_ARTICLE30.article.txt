Last quarter, a senior was picked up by the Palo Alto police for
lighting at a local drive-in and held overnight at the police station.
The student later, claiming that he was held illegally, sought
legal action against the police; the police retorted that they were
only doing their duty and the boy shouldn't get special considera
tion merely because he was a student.
The whole affair is just an indication of the situation that exists in
Palo Alto and on the campus today—a situation that has been get
ting steadily worse as the time goes by.
When Palo Alto was small, the job of law enforcement was car
ried on by the citizens, but as the town grew, the citizens found that
they could not handle the problems and thus they required a
bigger and better police force.
But, as the police force grew in power, the citizens built up a
growing dislike of the police. This distrust and dislike is particu
larly evident among many students who do everything in their
power to fool the police, and try to get away with as much as they
can without being caught. Then, when they are brought before
the judge, they plead injustice and prejudice on the part of the Palo
Alto police department.
A group of citizens in Palo Alto, seeing this situation develop,
have formed a committee to better relations between the police and
Ihe citizens—to show the citizens that the police are hired as pro
lection, and not as a dictatorial force who only want to control
Palo Alto.
Now then, it is a perfect time to improve the student-police rela
tionship. There are over 10,000 people associated with Stanford
during the year, and most of these people spend a considerable
amount of time in Palo Alto—a lot of them live there.
The University would do well to put several members, including
several students, on this committee. If the committee can function,
and we see no reason why it should not, then unpleasant incidents,
such as the above-mentioned suit for false arrest, might be avoided,
and Stanford would have a more secure and active part in its com
munity.
