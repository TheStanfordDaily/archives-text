War Mongering?
To the Editor:
In your editorial on the 10th of July headed "Policy Change Needed," you
were victimized, I believe, by your patriotic zeal.
Your first paragraph referred to the North Korean forces as "Russian -
t-ponsored Communist armies. . .
In your third paragraph you referred to the "Reds" who evidently had
been "massing troops" to the north. You did not state, however, whether
the "Reds" in question were North Korean or Russian. This would not have
been so misleading, perhaps, if you had not
In your sixth paragraph thrown us to the wolves by saying that "Russia
is showing no inclination to pull back to the 38th parallel. . . ."
And thus you have involved us in a war with Russia, and I protest.
Other places in your editorial discuss the possibility of the North Korean
forces being led by "Russian-trained ollicers." What this means to us I do
not know. I do know, however, that almost every large country in the world
trains officers for the smaller countries it is interested in. We in the United
States, for instance, train officers for the Mexican and Philippine and other
armies. And I see no danger in any of this as great as the danger of using
such loaded words and phrases in "Newspapers."
We do know for a fact, though, that the South Koreans are fighting with
not 6nly American-trained officers, but American officers, and American
men, and American arms, and American money. This is said to be at the
request of the United Nations but they haven't offered to pay any of the bills
und so I must conclude that it must well serve our interests to make this
expenditure. And what are these interests, Editor, that prompt us to light
for the democracy of the entire world, and its consequent peace? This
would, no doubt, make a subject for a good many interesting and entertain
ing editorials.
Please correct your mistake of involving us in a war with Russia, and try
to prevent us from going in the direction of such n war by making distinc
tions, avoiding loaded words and phrases, and staying away from cliche
patriotism.
