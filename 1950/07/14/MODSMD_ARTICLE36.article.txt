# SUNDAY FLICK
## 
### 
Sheer, unadulterated terror will
stalk in the Memorial Auditorium
Sunday night at 7:30 as "The Bride
of Frankenstein" makes her Stan
ford debut. The picture stars Boris
Karlofl and 38 pounds of expensive
make-up. Admission is the usual
20 cents.
Due to the spine-chilling horror
of this flick, children under 12
months old will not be admitted
without their parents.
