# A 						Storm, A Tiger-Idea Gets Lost Along the Way
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The premiere of Alexander
Greendaie's play, "A Storm, A Ti
ger," opened Wednesday night in
the Little Theater. Additional per
formances are scheduled for tonight
and tomorrow night, and Wednes
day through Saturday nights of
next week.
Greendaie's play deals with the
problem of a man's self-respect and
the price the idealist must pay to
maintain it. This theme, although it
has been kicked around a good deal
these days, is not incapable of a
good stiff analysis. But when that
analysis is befuddled with too many
unconvincing characters, sorry lincv;,
and a constant tendency to unbe
lievable melodrama, the message
gets lost along the way.
Part of the fault belongs with
Greensdale and part belongs with
the Stanford Players.
Chief difficulty had to do with the
size of the theater and the sets. In
genious as Ray Hubbard's stylized
sets were, they no more fitted the
play's highly intense conflicts than a
hungry elephant fits in a glass slip
per. The cozy, drawing-room at
mosphere of the Little Theater gave
the production a sense of bursting
seams as though somebody had for
got to clear the decks for action.
As for the play itself, Greendaie's
most unfortunate portrait was that
of the powerful and evil King fam
ily. Most rich and ruthless indus
trialists don't rage and argue points
of morals in the archaic diction of
a Victorian temperance tea. Rob
ert Kest, as Scott King, instead of
the real world-shaker he was ad
vertised to be, had little chance to
be anything but blufi' and threaten
ing. And his son, played by Gerald
Larson, was turned into a caricature
rather than the picture of human
weakness. Ralda Thygeson, as the
wife of the son, was saddled with a
good deal too many breathless sit
uations; but then so was the play.
The one who suffered most from
the puppet sets was the tiger him
self, Seymour Tuchow, who gave
the part of Russell Steele a smart
ing and violent idealism. This was a
tragedy, for Tuchow's talented pres
ence on the stage really kept the pot
boiling.
Most of the minor characters

were strong and well played. Espe
cially noticeable were Asher Wil
son, Emanue! Brookman, and Don
Campbell.
The facts of the plot were absorb
ing, some situations were very well
chosen, and occasionally the play
stood up and roared in real anguish.
More often, however, it was a pretty
confused tiger.

the production a sense of bursting
seams as though somebody had for
got to clear the decks for action.
As for the play itself, Greendaie's
most unfortunate portrait was that
of the powerful and evil King fam
ily. Most rich and ruthless indus
trialists don't rage and argue points
of morals in the archaic diction of
a Victorian temperance tea. Rob
ert Kest, as Scott King, instead of
the real world-shaker he was ad
vertised to be, had little chance to
be anything but blufi' and threaten
ing. And his son, played by Gerald
Larson, was turned into a caricature
rather than the picture of human
weakness. Ralda Thygeson, as the
wife of the son, was saddled with a
good deal too many breathless sit
uations; but then so was the play.
The one who suffered most from
the puppet sets was the tiger him
self, Seymour Tuchow, who gave
the part of Russell Steele a smart
ing and violent idealism. This was a
tragedy, for Tuchow's talented pres
ence on the stage really kept the pot
boiling.
Most of the minor characters

were strong and well played. Espe
cially noticeable were Asher Wil
son, Emanue! Brookman, and Don
Campbell.
The facts of the plot were absorb
ing, some situations were very well
chosen, and occasionally the play
stood up and roared in real anguish.
More often, however, it was a pretty
confused tiger.
The premiere of Alexander
Greendaie's play, "A Storm, A Ti
ger," opened Wednesday night in
the Little Theater. Additional per
formances are scheduled for tonight
and tomorrow night, and Wednes
day through Saturday nights of
next week.
Greendaie's play deals with the
problem of a man's self-respect and
the price the idealist must pay to
maintain it. This theme, although it
has been kicked around a good deal
these days, is not incapable of a
good stiff analysis. But when that
analysis is befuddled with too many
unconvincing characters, sorry lincv;,
and a constant tendency to unbe
lievable melodrama, the message
gets lost along the way.
Part of the fault belongs with
Greensdale and part belongs with
the Stanford Players.
Chief difficulty had to do with the
size of the theater and the sets. In
genious as Ray Hubbard's stylized
sets were, they no more fitted the
play's highly intense conflicts than a
hungry elephant fits in a glass slip
per. The cozy, drawing-room at
mosphere of the Little Theater gave
the production a sense of bursting
seams as though somebody had for
got to clear the decks for action.
