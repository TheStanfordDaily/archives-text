# ON THE BENCH with Al Berry
## 
### 
One of the printers at the Uni
versity Press, Lennie by name, is a
Stanford football fan, and as such
he often asks me questions regard
ing the Card gridders. Yesterday he
asked what effect the new draft
was going to have on Mr. Schwartz's
red-shirted charges. My immediate I
answer was "Practically none."'
Then I checked up on it and found
to my surprise that I was right, and
thus a column was born.
Fourteen of the men who figure |
prominently in next season's lineup i
are veterans, and thus draft-exempt
—at least under the present set-up. 1
Halfback Boyd Benson, guard Jesse
Cone, and tackle-!ine-backer Iluss
Peine roy were in the paratroops
during the last (or was it the time
before last?) international unpleas
antness. All three first - stringers !
are, moreover, doubly insured: 1
Benson holds a reserve commission
as a second lieutenant in the field
artillery, and Cone and Pomeroy
are the proud possessors of wives.
Other veterans on next year's
squad are halfbacks Holy Boruck,
Blondy Broome, and Eric South
wood; ends Don Enberft, Bruce Van
Alstyne, and Irv Yancey: fullback
Bob Griffin; and linemen Ron Gar

ner, Ted Taylor, and Don Tobin.
Top-notch center Gorr'y Rice is an
Air Force vet, but the big line
backer has not yet fully recovered
from a Big Game-acquired broken
leg and probably will not figure too
prominently in next year's grid war
games.
The others, the hot-shots of the
'ast three undefeated freshman
squads, the men like Kerkorian.
Horn, Hr v asian, Lucas, Rye. and
MtColl, could be asked to contrib
ute time and honor to the armed
forces, but probably won't. With
the exception of the above-named
veterans, all of the returning men
who made the travel squad last year
are 21 years of age or under. With
the draft starting at the 25-year
olds and working down, it is highly
unlikely that any 19-. 20-. and 21-
ers wili be greeted before next Sep
tember. After mid-September, and
registration, the gridders, being col
lege men, will receive exemptions
for the school year.
The big worry of the 1950 foot
ball team, at this writing, is not
the drfat or the North Koreans,
but —as always — CSC, UCLA,
Army, and the University of Cali
fornia.

Halfback Boyd Benson, guard Jesse
Cone, and tackle-!ine-backer Iluss
Peine roy were in the paratroops
during the last (or was it the time
before last?) international unpleas
antness. All three first - stringers !
are, moreover, doubly insured: 1
Benson holds a reserve commission
as a second lieutenant in the field
artillery, and Cone and Pomeroy
are the proud possessors of wives.
Other veterans on next year's
squad are halfbacks Holy Boruck,
Blondy Broome, and Eric South
wood; ends Don Enberft, Bruce Van
Alstyne, and Irv Yancey: fullback
Bob Griffin; and linemen Ron Gar

ner, Ted Taylor, and Don Tobin.
Top-notch center Gorr'y Rice is an
Air Force vet, but the big line
backer has not yet fully recovered
from a Big Game-acquired broken
leg and probably will not figure too
prominently in next year's grid war
games.
The others, the hot-shots of the
'ast three undefeated freshman
squads, the men like Kerkorian.
Horn, Hr v asian, Lucas, Rye. and
MtColl, could be asked to contrib
ute time and honor to the armed
forces, but probably won't. With
the exception of the above-named
veterans, all of the returning men
who made the travel squad last year
are 21 years of age or under. With
the draft starting at the 25-year
olds and working down, it is highly
unlikely that any 19-. 20-. and 21-
ers wili be greeted before next Sep
tember. After mid-September, and
registration, the gridders, being col
lege men, will receive exemptions
for the school year.
The big worry of the 1950 foot
ball team, at this writing, is not
the drfat or the North Koreans,
but —as always — CSC, UCLA,
Army, and the University of Cali
fornia.

One of the printers at the Uni
versity Press, Lennie by name, is a
Stanford football fan, and as such
he often asks me questions regard
ing the Card gridders. Yesterday he
asked what effect the new draft
was going to have on Mr. Schwartz's
red-shirted charges. My immediate I
answer was "Practically none."'
Then I checked up on it and found
to my surprise that I was right, and
thus a column was born.
