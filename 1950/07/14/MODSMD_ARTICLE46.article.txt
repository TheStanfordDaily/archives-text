GARY KERKORIAN AND DICK HORN are the Cards' one-two
punch in the all-important quarterback slot. Kerkorian, a well-man
nered lad from Inglewood, was last year's game starter and will prob
ably continue in the same role next year. The 6 ft. 1 in., ISO-pound pig
skin slinger was one of the brighter stars in last autumn's brilliant 34-13
conquest of USC. Kerkorion played both offense and defense in that tilt
and ended the game with gushing praise from the defeated Trojans, and
a badly bruised shoulder that kept him close to the bench for the re
maining tv\o games of the season. Gary is a cool, clever signal-caller, a
fine ball-handler, and a good short ball passer.
Dick Horn, who was an all-CIF quarterback at Santa Monica High,
has had Kerkorian trouble since arriving at Stanford. Horn is a good
enough quartet back to open the games at most schools. His biggest
trouble is that Gary has proved better so far in the signal-calling and
ball-handling departments. Dick stands (J ft. 2 in his stocking feet, and
weighs IS7 pounds. He is the best passer on the Indian squad and showed
up brilliantly in the last two tussles of last season. Horn may see con
siderable action as a defensive safety next year, since—after the USC
game—the coaches may feel that Kerkorian's offensive ability is toa
valuable to risk on defense. Horn, at any rate, adds security to the
under-'the-center slot, thus making it one of the team's strongest posi
tions.
