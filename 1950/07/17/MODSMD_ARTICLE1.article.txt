# Crothers Addition Announced At Law Dedication Exercises
## New Wings Will Double Capacity 
### 
Work will begin this fall on two
new wings which will mere than
double the capacity of Stanford's
Crothers Hall, residence hall for
law students, University President
Wallace Sterling announced Satur
day.
The additions, like the original
unit opened in October, 1948, are
made possible by gifts from Judge
George E. Crothers of San Fran
cisco, closely associated with the
University since its opening 59
years ago.
Announcement of the gift of the
new wings came as Stanford Law
School faculty, students, and alumni
joined to dedicate the new Law
School building in a two-day pro
gram Friday and Saturday featur
ing an address by U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Robert H. Jackson.
The Crothers Hall additions will
add 40 double rooms to the building,
which houses 63 graduate law stu
dents. Eighty students are expected
to be able to move ino the new
quarters at the opening of the 1951-
52 school year, according to Law
School Dean Carl B. Spaeth.
The new two-story wings will run
at right angles from each end of
the presen building, forming a "U"-
shaped residence unit. The building
is located on Galvez Street near En
cina Hall, the University's oldest
residence hall, where Judge Croth
ers lived as a student in the early
1890s.
The wings, designed by Architects
Eldridge T. Spencer and William C.
Ambrose, will match the first unit
in architecture —contemporary style
with buff and gray plaster finish and
red-tiled roof.
Each wing will be 85 feet long and
will have a frontage of 38 feet on
Galvez Sreet. Each floor will have
10 rooms and lavatory and shower
facilities.
The rooms will be furnished with
two desks, beds, chairs, and a ward
robe close and lavatory. Men living
in the new rooms and residents of
the first unit will share the lounge
and law library established by
Judge Crothers on the ground floor
of the original building.
The hall's donor dates his interest

in Stanford back to his undergradu
ate days, an interest he maintained
after his graduation with the pio
neer class of 1895.
For several years he served as a
counselor and adviser to Mrs. Le
land Stanford, co-founder of the
University, and helped to establish
the legal status of the institution.
He continued his interest as the
first Stanford alumnus to serve on
the University's Board of Trustees.
His special interset in law students
gave rise to a scholarship estab
lished in 1912 and the gift of the
residence hall.

the first unit will share the lounge
and law library established by
Judge Crothers on the ground floor
of the original building.
The hall's donor dates his interest

in Stanford back to his undergradu
ate days, an interest he maintained
after his graduation with the pio
neer class of 1895.
For several years he served as a
counselor and adviser to Mrs. Le
land Stanford, co-founder of the
University, and helped to establish
the legal status of the institution.
He continued his interest as the
first Stanford alumnus to serve on
the University's Board of Trustees.
His special interset in law students
gave rise to a scholarship estab

Work will begin this fall on two
new wings which will mere than
double the capacity of Stanford's
Crothers Hall, residence hall for
law students, University President
Wallace Sterling announced Satur
day.
The additions, like the original
unit opened in October, 1948, are
made possible by gifts from Judge
George E. Crothers of San Fran
cisco, closely associated with the
University since its opening 59
years ago.
Announcement of the gift of the
new wings came as Stanford Law
School faculty, students, and alumni
joined to dedicate the new Law
School building in a two-day pro
gram Friday and Saturday featur
ing an address by U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Robert H. Jackson.
The Crothers Hall additions will
add 40 double rooms to the building,
which houses 63 graduate law stu
dents. Eighty students are expected
to be able to move ino the new
quarters at the opening of the 1951-
52 school year, according to Law
School Dean Carl B. Spaeth.
The new two-story wings will run
at right angles from each end of
the presen building, forming a "U"-
shaped residence unit. The building
is located on Galvez Street near En
cina Hall, the University's oldest
residence hall, where Judge Croth
ers lived as a student in the early
1890s.
The wings, designed by Architects
Eldridge T. Spencer and William C.
Ambrose, will match the first unit
in architecture —contemporary style
with buff and gray plaster finish and
red-tiled roof.
Each wing will be 85 feet long and
will have a frontage of 38 feet on
Galvez Sreet. Each floor will have
10 rooms and lavatory and shower
facilities.
The rooms will be furnished with
two desks, beds, chairs, and a ward
robe close and lavatory. Men living
in the new rooms and residents of
the first unit will share the lounge
and law library established by
Judge Crothers on the ground floor
of the original building.
