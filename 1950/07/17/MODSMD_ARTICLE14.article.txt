# SUCCESS STORY:
## Spring Sports Review: Cards Get Idea—Win! 
### LARRY CAHN 
Although it is summer time, the
living is easy, and all athletics are
at a standstill. Let's look back to
spring quarter and review the suc
cesses of the Farm's athletic teams.
Baseball is a good starting point.
The Indians swept the CIBA cham
pionship for the first time in 19

years. Coach Everett Dean's bat
men took the three-game Califor
nia series, a significant feat in it
self.
Earning the right to play Wash
ington State College for the PCC
title, the club traveled to Pullman
only to lose two games which were
tighter than Scotchmen. 3 to 2 and
G to 5. Sophomore pitching sensa
tion Joe Chez, who ended the sea
son with eight wins and one loss,
suffered his first defeat while wear
ing Stanford colors in the 3 to 2
opener.
The track team on the Big
Meet, bested USC in the Modesto
Relays, and the frosh cindermen
were undefeated.
Gay Bryan, grabbing firsts in the
broad and high jumps, seconds in
the 100, the 220, and the low hur-

dies, accounted for 19 points as the
Indians trounced their rivals from
the school in the Berkeley Hills 81
to 50.
Bob Mathias copped five firsts and
a second as the freshman thinclads
swept past the Cubs 74 to 57.
The Cards gave up a Fresno Re
lay win to USC on Referee A. A.
Stagg's decision, but at the Modesto
Relays, the following week, upset

the national champion Trojans 45
to. 40Vi.
In the PCC meet Otis Chandler
set a new shot put record with a
toss of 57 feet 4Vs inches, but with
Bryan ailing the Indians were once
more second to USC.
As far as golf goes, it was a case
of an underdog Stanford team with
a record of seven wins and four
losses, upsetting a previously un
defeated UCLA team to annex the
southern division team champion
ship.
Indian Dick McElyea took indi
vidual glory by edging the Califor
nia entry, Ted Engs.
Coach Bud Finger's PCC link -
sters, Crozier, Knozier, McElyea,
Wallace, Moe, and Mitten, went on
to the NCAA tournament at Albu
querque, New Mexico. The under
dog Cards in this meet came out a
surprising and splendid third be
hind West Texas State and Purdue.
Rugby enjoyed a highly suc
cessful season, sweeping all local
and southern competition. Cali
fornia and UCLA were among the
vanquished. The Indians split a
home-and-home series with the
University of British Columbia.
Varsity footballers were the
mainstay of Coach Chuck Taylor's
squad.
Although dropping a dual meet

to USC, the swimming team
splashed to its eleventh southern di
vision championship in the Califor
nia pool May 11. Ralph Sala set a
new meet record in the 440 free
style, being clocked at 4:43.5.
Previously the Indians had
dunked California and UCLA.
One of the biggest surprises was
the excellent showing of the crew
at Marietta. Although originally
named as third-place winners, the
Card crew was dropped back to the
fourth spot when movies showed
that Wisconsin had edged the In
dians.
The oarsmen in early spring
defeated USC, UCLA, and a vis
iting University of British Co
lumbia crew, but were nosed out
by California.
Tennis was the only sport not
getting the idea, and the squad fin
ished in the basement of the south
ern dWiaion.
With a good spring sports record
behind us, the decks are cleared for
the arrival of King Football in all
his pomp and circumstance.
