BILL McCOLL and BRUCE VAN ALSTYNE look, at this time, to'be
the starting ends for Marchie Schwartz's autumn Redshirts. McColl,
last fall, was thought by many to be the coast's number one end. Cer
tainly he looked that way against USC and California. Against these
two arch-rivals. Bill was an Ail-American, and you can get few argu
ments on that score. McColl, who weighs close to 220 and stands (> feet
4 inches, was not only an offensive gem, but was a brilliant defensive
tackle last season.
Bruce Van Alstvne, once a fine !Vlenlo JC fullback, was Stanford's
defensive right end last year and will probably get to try out his pass
snagging style next fall. Bruce, who stands 6 feet 2 inches, looked par
ticularly fine last year frustrating USC's futile attempts to run his end.
He is a senior next year.
JACK RYE, a Los Angeles lad putting in his second year 011 the
varsity, cannot be overlooked in any speculation about the Cards' end
might. Rye, although as yet he is entirely a defensive player, was one
of the mightier mainstays of the '49 Big Red Machine. Jack, until in
jured in Troyland. was one of the best defensive wingmen 011 the coast.
He should be again next season.
