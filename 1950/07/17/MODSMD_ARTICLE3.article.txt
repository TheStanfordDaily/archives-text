# Jackson Assails Trial Publicity
## 
### 
"Trial by publicity" is threaten
ing our judicial procedures, making
fair trials increasingly difficult to
obtain, U.S. Supreme Court Asso
ciate Justice Robert H. Jackson
warned Saturday at the dedication
of the new Law School.
"The trial judge has largely lost
control of the influences that can be
brought to bear upon the jury," he
stated.
Jackson said radio, television,
newsreels, and newspapers combine
to bring to jurors "matters which
the judge rules to be inadmissible
and (which the judge) keeps the
lawyers from presenting in court."
"The custom of pre-judging guilt
or innocence and of injecting evi
dence and opinions upon the trial
by publicity can easily proceed to
such a point that verdicts in highly
publicized American cases will no
more i-eally represent the jurors'
dispassionate personal judgment on
the legal evidence than do those of
"people's courts" we so criticize
abroad," he said.
He asserted that if a trial is to be
orderly and its result accepted as
sound judgment, it must be a con
trolled and disciplined proceeding
from beginning to end.
Turning to a discussion of law
studies, Jackson urged that students
be given practice in dealing with
live problems of law instead of hy
pothetical ones.
"If the weakness of the appren
tice system was to produce advo
cates without scholarship, the
weakness of the law school system
is to turn out scholars with no skill
at advocacy,' he stated.
He suggested that legal aid clinics
be set up so that law students might
conduct interviews with indigent
clients, deal with the clients' wit
nesses, and prepare a brief of the
facts.
In this way, "the law schools
might recapture some of the values
lost with abandonment of the ap
prenticeship system," he said.
The justice's talk concluded the
two-day dedication ceremony which
featured speeches by Lon L. Fuller,
a Carter professor of jurisprudence
at Harvard, and Harrison Tweed,
president of the American Law In
stitute.
