# Reds Smash Through Kum River Line; Send Yanks Staggering Back to Taejon
## Communist Rail Lines Hit by B-29's In Attempt to Cut Off Supplies 
### 
TOKYO, Monday, July 17 (UP) —Waves of North Korean Com
munist troops swept through a breach in the center of the Ameri
can Kum River defense line today toward Taejon which v/as re
ported under artillery fire.
The Reds broke open the American defenses in the central

♦sector late Sunday and sent the U.S.
troops racing back to Taejon, which
until recently was the South Ko
rean emergency captal.
The Amercan defenses crumbled
under the weight of vastly greater
numbers of Communist troops who
smashed through a curtain of ar
tillery fire in screaming, suicidal as
| saults.
Snipers reached the vicinity of
Taejon late Sunday, and this morn
ing artillery fire was reported
reaching the former emergency
capital which had a population of
136,000 before its people began flee
ing southward last week.
As the Americans fell back from,
their Kum River defenses, Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur's air communi
que disclosed that more than 50
B-29's had dropped 400 tons of
; bombs on the Seoul railroad yards
in a strike against the Communists'
supply lines.
The big planes left the yards in
■ j flames after the raid Sunday, the
communique said, and returned
safely after flying, .through "con
siderable flak." The raiders left
, shops in the yards afire, severed
. through tracks, and damaged other
buildings. There was no air resist
: ance, and several Russian-built Yak
j fighters fied when they saw the
B-29's.
; It was the second big B-29 of
! the war and involved more planes
: than in last week's strike against
, Wonsan. in which the raiders drop
ped 500 tons of bombs.
In another raid Sunday, the com
munique said, 70 tons of explosives
were rained on the enemy immedi
ately behind the battle area near
Chungju, northeast of Taejon.
The Red breakthrough was the
first in the central sector of the
American line, which had beaten off
earlier attempts to cross the river.
There was no word today of the
Americans who had been holding
the western end of the U.S. line
against the big bridgehead. It ap
peared they might be cut off from
the other American forces unless
they made a fast withdrawal to the
south or southwest. If they did pulL
out. they may have recalled the re
treating Americans from the central
sector in the Taejon area.

first in the central sector of the
American line, which had beaten off
earlier attempts to cross the river.
There was no word today of the
Americans who had been holding
the western end of the U.S. line
against the big bridgehead. It ap
peared they might be cut off from
the other American forces unless
they made a fast withdrawal to the
south or southwest. If they did pulL
out. they may have recalled the re
treating Americans from the central
sector in the Taejon area.
TOKYO, Monday, July 17 (UP) —Waves of North Korean Com
munist troops swept through a breach in the center of the Ameri
can Kum River defense line today toward Taejon which v/as re
ported under artillery fire.
The Reds broke open the American defenses in the central

♦sector late Sunday and sent the U.S.
troops racing back to Taejon, which
until recently was the South Ko
rean emergency captal.
The Amercan defenses crumbled
under the weight of vastly greater
numbers of Communist troops who
smashed through a curtain of ar
tillery fire in screaming, suicidal as
| saults.
Snipers reached the vicinity of
Taejon late Sunday, and this morn
ing artillery fire was reported
reaching the former emergency
capital which had a population of
136,000 before its people began flee
ing southward last week.
As the Americans fell back from,
their Kum River defenses, Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur's air communi
que disclosed that more than 50
B-29's had dropped 400 tons of
; bombs on the Seoul railroad yards
in a strike against the Communists'
supply lines.
The big planes left the yards in
■ j flames after the raid Sunday, the
communique said, and returned
safely after flying, .through "con
siderable flak." The raiders left
, shops in the yards afire, severed
. through tracks, and damaged other
buildings. There was no air resist
: ance, and several Russian-built Yak
j fighters fied when they saw the
B-29's.
; It was the second big B-29 of
! the war and involved more planes
: than in last week's strike against
, Wonsan. in which the raiders drop
ped 500 tons of bombs.
In another raid Sunday, the com
munique said, 70 tons of explosives
were rained on the enemy immedi
ately behind the battle area near
Chungju, northeast of Taejon.
The Red breakthrough was the
first in the central sector of the
American line, which had beaten off
earlier attempts to cross the river.
There was no word today of the
Americans who had been holding
the western end of the U.S. line
against the big bridgehead. It ap
peared they might be cut off from
the other American forces unless
they made a fast withdrawal to the
south or southwest. If they did pulL
out. they may have recalled the re
treating Americans from the central
sector in the Taejon area.
