# Solon Warns Of a Long War
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 16 (UP) —
U.S. military officials were stunned
today by the new American retreat
in Korea, and a Senate leader pre
dicted it will take six to nine
months to drive the Red invaders
back behind their own frontier.
A grim spokesman for the mili
tary high command refused to com
ment on the North Korean break
through along the Kum River line.
He said the chiefs of staff were
keeping in close touch with the sit
uation and were awaiting details
from Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur be
fore assessing the gravity of the re
versal.
It probably will take some time
for new battle lines to become
"firm" and allow an accurate as
sessment of the situation, he added.
Meanwhile, Chairman Millard E.
Tydings, D„ Md., of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said it
will take at least six to nine months
to crush the present forces of Com
munist North Korea, and even
longer if Russia or Red China sends
troops into the fray.
His estimate presumably reflected
the views of top military leaders,
including Mac Arthur. Their confi
dential appraisal of the situation
was relayed to Tydings' committee
last week by Gen. Omar N. Brad
ley, chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff.
In other developments:
Sen. Edward P. Martin, R., Pa.,
said "stupid blundering" by the
State Department caused the Ko
rean war, but now that U.S. fighting
forces are committed in Korea, he
added, Americans should back the
government to the limit.
AFL President William Green
called for "all-out preparedness" to
meet Communist aggression and
pledged the full co-operation of or
ganized labor. He said there "must
be mobilization of labor" but did not
elaborate.
