## Our Honor Code 
### 
"No unpermitted aid is to be given or received for any examina
tion, paper, project, or any other assigned work."
This is the essence of the Stanford Honor Code. To most of us,
it is pretty familiar stuff, but to many students who have come
Irom schools and colleges without such a code, outright cheating
or just "helpful hinting" is the thing to do as long as you don't
get caught.
At Stanford, the enforcement of the Honor Code is up to the
students â€”there are no proctors patrolling examinations, ready
to pounce on the first suspicious character.
The Honor Code is the pride and joy of Stanford and is taken
seriously by both students and instructors. Very few violators
go undetected. The penalty is severe, ranging all the way from
failure in the course involved to complete expulsion.
