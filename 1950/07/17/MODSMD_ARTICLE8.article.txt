## History—1950 
### 
With all of America watching and waiting for news of the Korean fight
ing—with their attention centered completely on that little peninsula jui
cing 500 miles out of Asia, it might not be a bad idea to take a look at
another hot spot in the world today. Granted, the European news isn't
as exciting as the war bulletins, but it could be just as important, espe
cially the news from that traditional powder keg—Yugoslavia.
Late Friday night, Yugoslavia charged that Bulgarian forces had
crossed the border at four points and were firing on Yugoslav guards.
For months, reports have been coming in telling of unrest on this
border, but this is the first charge of an actual invasion by Bulgarian
forces.
Located on the western side of the restless Balkan Peninsula, Yugo
slavia is the perfect target for further Russian aggression. Already, the
Reds have taken Yugoslavia's three eastern neighbors under their guiding
hand—Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. Now it appears that Yugoslavia
is next on the Kremlin's "little list."
Rumors are flying thick and fast through Yugoslavia of troop move
nens, tank maneuvers, and frontier sorties near the country's eastern
border. Although midsummer rumors are as regular as the seasons in
Yugoslavia, especially since the Moscow-led Cominform ousted Tito in
1948, the government in Belgrade is a little more anxious this year about
die whole situation in light of the trouble in Korea.
U.S. military experts in Berlin, studying Communist moves in the
Balkans, have concluded the Yugoslav army is both willing and able to
stand off any threat from the bordering nations alone. A senior American
ifficer said Thursday that Yugoslavia has 30 well-trained divisions and
"the only way they will take Tito is if the Red Army itself marches in.''
The Yugoslavia force, perhaps 300,000 men, was described as actually out
numbering the armies of Bulgaria and Romania which have been doing
most of the saber-rattling.
No, it is not the neighboring forces that are worrying the men in
Belgrade—but the possbiility of these three Red satellites getting help
from Russia in the effort to include Yugoslavia in the Communist orbit.
A student at Stanford received a letter from a friend in Hungary who
said that a large number of Russian-trained East German police force
troops had packed up and left—headed for who knows where. There is
a general feeling in the area that these troops are headed south for the
Balkan Peninsula.
The Balkans might not be as interesting a place as Korea at the mo
nent, but they could be just as important. With American naval, air, and
ground forces being rushed to the Pacific. Europe is left wide open—
j stamping ground for whoever wants it.
