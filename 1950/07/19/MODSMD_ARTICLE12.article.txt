BULLETIN
ABOARD AN AMPHIBIOUS FLAGSHIP OFF KOREA, July H
(UP) —Major reinforcements for the American attempt to halt the Com
munist North Korean offensive landed safely today on a South Korean
beachhead, climaxing the fastest amphibious operation in history, andi
the first of its type since the end of World War 11. (No information was
given as to position or size of landing.)
TOKYO, Wednesday, July 19 (UP)—American Army combat
patrols went hunting for the North Korean Communists today
while artillery and airplanes attacked the enemy mercilessly both
south and north of the Kum River.
The enemy drive southward had stalled, after three weeks, on

♦ the outskirts of Taejon.
A North Korean government ra
! dio broadcast this morning reported
| merely that the Communist army
j "inflicted heavy damages on the en
emy and was continuing the as
i sault." It made no mention of the
Taejon front but claimed the cap
ture of Nonsan, 22 miles southwest
!of Taejon. Nonsan had been re
ported earlier-as having fallen to
the Communists on Sunday.
A terrific air offensive by Ameri
j can and Australian planes had per
| vented the enemy from moving
tanks and heavy artillery across the
1 Kum.
Tanks, troop columns, railroads,
bridges, and highways were under
a dawn-to-dark attack.
A prime target was the working
parties which the North Koreans
sent out in an attempt to repair the
wrecked Kum River highway
bridge, which the Communists need
to bring across their tanks and big
' guns.
For the present the Communist
infantrymen, who forced a crossing
I of the Kum at enormous cost, and
the guerrillas operating with them,
were cut off from the tanks and
guns on the other side.
American artillery ripped into the
enemy lines on the south side of
the Kum at will.
Front dispatches said that no en
emy artillery fire was falling into
1 the American lines because the en
emy big guns were out of ranga
across the Kum.
Maj. Gen. William F. Dean, com
manding the United States 24th In
fantry, sent out combat patrols on
the offensive to probe the suddenly
j quiet enemy lines.
So quiet was the front that Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur decided not to
issue his usual midnight communi
que.
"There has been no change in the
situation to warrant a communi
que," a General Headquarters
spokesman said.
Front dispatches said there was
virtually no action on the western
| front except for the American pa~
, trol activities, and the pounding of
I the enemy by plane sand artillery.
But there was a change, dis
j patches said, in the outlook in Ko -
rea.
