Here at Stanford, as at most colleges, there is a vague, intangible
barrier thrown up between the faculty and students—a barrier
that exists in spite of the varied attempts to break it down.
The Social Committee of the ASSU realizes that this trouble
exists and are making a definite attempt in their plans to do away

Tomorrow afternoon, from 3 to 5, there will be an all-campus
get together in Union Court—not just students, not just faculty,
but students and faculty alike are invited for an afternoon of fun,
entertainment, and refreshments.
So, students, here's an opportunity to meet the faculty members
you have been listening to for the last four weeks; professors,
here's your chance to get acquainted with those scholars who try
and look so attentive at 8 o'clock in the morning.
