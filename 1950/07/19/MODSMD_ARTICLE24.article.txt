Many on campus may remember
Mark O. Hatfield, a political science
student who graduated last year
and is now a professor of political
science at Willamette University,
Oregon. Hatfield has just helped
write a new apportionment plan for
Oregon's legislature. Enough signa
ture's have been turned in to the
elections registrar to assure the
plan's appearing on the November
general election ballot.
During Hatfield's graduate period
at Stanford. Jiggs McCaulley. Mari
anna Olmstead, and Hatfield revised
the ASSU constitution.
The Oregon plan will call for the
allotting of one seat in the House
and the Senate to each of the state's
36 counties. The remaining seats
will be divided up on a population
basis.
Hatfield has won GOP nomina
tion with three other Republicans
from Marion County for the state
House of Representatives when he
polled the largest number of votes
among fellow candidates.
