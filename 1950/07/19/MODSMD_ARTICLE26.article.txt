# Dr. Lobanov-Rostovsky at Stanford; Former Russ Prince Is Visiting Prof

Stanford is graced by nobility.
Dr. Andrei Lobanov-Rostovsky, de
scendant of the royal house of Ru
rik, is teaching two courses in Rus
sian history here this summer. Dr.
Lobanov - Rostovsky is a visiting
professor from the University of
Michigan.
The life of this modest little man
who was a prince has been filled
with adventures equal to those of a
hero in a novel. But truth is stran
ger than fiction.
Dr. Lobanov-Rostovsky was born
in Yokohama, Japan, where his fa
ther was stationed as a Russian dip
lomat. The major part of his educa
tion was acquired in Russia.
Commenting on Russian educa
tion, he said that the system before
the revolution was patterned after
that oÂ£ the western European na
tions: "gymnasiums" for classical
studies, and "real schools" which
treated the technical fields. In 1903
a law was passed in Russia to make
secondary education compulsory. At
that time about 45 per cent of the
people were illiterate, but now, said
Professor Lobanov - Rostovsky, "il
literacy is practically stamped out."
The professor knew of one engi
neering student who took ten years
to complete his course. The Rus
sian explanation for this was that
the student had to learn a great
volume of material so that he would
be of use in any type of situation.
After completing his education
Prince Lobanov - Rostovsky joined
the Imperial Guards, Russia's crack
mliitary unit at that time.
For his service in the Russian
army he received the orders of St.
Vladimir, St. Ann, and St. Stanis
laus.
When the revolution broke Prince
Lobanov-Rostovsky went with the
Russian troops to Macedonia by
way of the Arctic Sea. In Macedo
nia the Russian division collapsed
and was absorbed by the French.
"One of my most interesting ex
periences," he said, "was when the

Germans surrounded the Russian
troops in 1914 in Poland, and began
firing at their own men, thinking
that they were the Russians. Be
cause of this, I was one of the 13
per cent that got out alive."
Instead of being an actor on the
great stage of Russian history, Dr
Lobanov-Rostovsky prefers to teach
or to write about his homeland, and
has done so in three books, "Russia
and Asia," "The Grinding Mill," and
the recently published book "Russia
and Europe."
