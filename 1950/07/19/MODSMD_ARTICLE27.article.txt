# Paris Horrors Shown in S.F.
## 
### 
Last Wednesday night the San
Francisco Repertory Theater began
a series of selected plays from the
repertoire of the Grand Guignol.
This is the first showing of the
French horror classics, now in their
fifty-third season in Paris where
they are considered one of the
major tourist attractions.
In Paris the horror-dramas are
! presented in a quaint Gothic chapel
i on the edge of Montmartre known
|as Le Theatre du Grand-Guignol
, (The Theater of the Big Puppets).
Here for more than 50 years Grand -
j Guignolers have been scaring Pa
| risians and American tourists with
J a nightly round of murders, man
i gling, and assorted acts of tortur
! ing.
Through two wars, many politi
! cal crises and one German Â©ccupa
! tion, the Guignol has remained a.-
i much a Paris phenomenon as the
famed Folies-Bergeres. Aided by
j trick lighting, fearsome props, and
! makeup, the Guignolers go happily
[ and homicidally about their busi
ness of gouging out one another's
I eyes, hurling vitriol, and cutting
| throats, all to the accompaniment o;
{ hysterical laughter and hideous
shrieks.
