Head Football Coach at California
Here is a report on our football
prospects for the coming season at
the University of California.
Spring practice was very impor
tant this year as our team must be
completely rebuilt. We have lost by
graduation 27 lettermen from the
1949 team — more than any other
school in the conference. We have
lost eight out of the starting defen
sive team who kicked off to start
the Rose Bowl game. We have lost
eight of the offensive team and we
have lost six from the '"all-purpose"
team which we use to reinforce ei
ther the offensive team or the de
fensive team as needed.
Two hundred and fifty men
checked out suits to participate in
spring practice. Even though
many of them were inexperienced
(over GO had never participated
in high school football), such a
fine turnout was most heart
warming and indicated a fine in
terest in football on the part of
our students at California.
We made several small cuts dur
ing spring practice and the natural
process of elimination was also at
work, but in our final scrimmage
we had over 80 boys participating
as well as additional men on the
previous day.
Our spring practice squad was
very young and very inexperienced,
but they worked hard and I felt
that we made good progress. To
strengthen our line, it was neces
sary to make a number of shifts in

position on the basis of our last
scrimmage. Our temporary first
three teams for the start of practice
next fall should line up approxi
mately as follows:
Center—Stathakis, Groger, Harris.
Right guard—Richter, Edmonston,
Laster.
Left guard—Solari, Mering, Hahn
or G. Witter.
Right tackle — Curran. Miksits,
Bagley, Krueger.
Left tackle—Karpe, Cunningham,
Blanchard, Witter, Bob.
Right end — Minuhen, Cummings,
LemMon.
Left end—Bartlett, Ward, 3eal.
Quarterback — Ogden. Marines,
Lee, Mais, Markey.
Right half — Robison, Schabarum,
Hibbs, Baham.
Left half — Pappa, Nystuen, O'-
Hare.
Fullback — Monachino, Olszewski,
Cadenasso.
I Would like to emphasize that the
temporary lineups listed here are
merely guesses and do not take into
consideration some further shifts in
position, especially in the backfield.
Ninety-five men will be invited
back for the pre-season practice
on September 1. This squad will
forf the basis of our varsity and
Rambler teams.
In trying to analyze our prospects
for next fall, I feel that the follow
ing are valid conclusions: (1) We
will be the most inexperienced team
in the Pacific Coast Conference. (2)
We will be a young squad—on the
average two and a half to three
years younger than last year. (3)
We have, as a squad, good size and
fair speed. (4-) I am confident that
our team will have good spirit.
They will probably be somewhat
over-eager, and I know they will
make mistakes, some of which may

prove costly.
So far as squad distribution is
concerncd, I feel we will have
strength at center, guards and
tackles will be big. green, and
have reasonable speed. Our end
squad will be adequate but not
outstanding. Our quarterbacks
will be extremely inexperienced.
The halfback and fullback posi
tions show strength but not as yet
nearly enough depth. Our passing
will be just fair; our kicking, ade
quate. On defense, our line will be
inexperienced, but bolstered by
good depth at the linebacking spots.
We have very few experienced de
fensive halfbacks and are somewhat
thin at the safety position.
It is impossible to predict what a
team as young and inexperienced
as the California team of 1950 will
do under game conditions. We will
inevitably lose some games, but I
am confident that our team will be
most interesting to work with n
to watch, and I know they wil! ac
cept the responsibility of represent
ing the University of California this
fall with spirit and eagerness.

tant this year as our team must be
completely rebuilt. We have lost by
graduation 27 lettermen from the
1949 team — more than any other
school in the conference. We have
lost eight out of the starting defen
sive team who kicked off to start
the Rose Bowl game. We have lost
eight of the offensive team and we
have lost six from the '"all-purpose"
team which we use to reinforce ei
ther the offensive team or the de
fensive team as needed.
Two hundred and fifty men
checked out suits to participate in
spring practice. Even though
many of them were inexperienced
(over GO had never participated
in high school football), such a
fine turnout was most heart
warming and indicated a fine in
terest in football on the part of
our students at California.
We made several small cuts dur
ing spring practice and the natural
process of elimination was also at
work, but in our final scrimmage
we had over 80 boys participating
as well as additional men on the
previous day.
Our spring practice squad was
very young and very inexperienced,
but they worked hard and I felt
that we made good progress. To
strengthen our line, it was neces
sary to make a number of shifts in

position on the basis of our last
scrimmage. Our temporary first
three teams for the start of practice
next fall should line up approxi
mately as follows:
Center—Stathakis, Groger, Harris.
Right guard—Richter, Edmonston,
Laster.
Left guard—Solari, Mering, Hahn
or G. Witter.
Right tackle — Curran. Miksits,
Bagley, Krueger.
Left tackle—Karpe, Cunningham,
Blanchard, Witter, Bob.
Right end — Minuhen, Cummings,
LemMon.
Left end—Bartlett, Ward, 3eal.
Quarterback — Ogden. Marines,
Lee, Mais, Markey.
Right half — Robison, Schabarum,
Hibbs, Baham.
Left half — Pappa, Nystuen, O'-
Hare.
Fullback — Monachino, Olszewski,
Cadenasso.
I Would like to emphasize that the
temporary lineups listed here are
merely guesses and do not take into
consideration some further shifts in
position, especially in the backfield.
Ninety-five men will be invited
back for the pre-season practice
on September 1. This squad will
forf the basis of our varsity and
Rambler teams.
In trying to analyze our prospects
for next fall, I feel that the follow
ing are valid conclusions: (1) We
will be the most inexperienced team
in the Pacific Coast Conference. (2)
We will be a young squad—on the
average two and a half to three
years younger than last year. (3)
We have, as a squad, good size and
fair speed. (4-) I am confident that
our team will have good spirit.
They will probably be somewhat
over-eager, and I know they will
make mistakes, some of which may

prove costly.
So far as squad distribution is
concerncd, I feel we will have
strength at center, guards and
tackles will be big. green, and
have reasonable speed. Our end
squad will be adequate but not
outstanding. Our quarterbacks
will be extremely inexperienced.
The halfback and fullback posi
tions show strength but not as yet
nearly enough depth. Our passing
will be just fair; our kicking, ade
quate. On defense, our line will be
inexperienced, but bolstered by
good depth at the linebacking spots.
We have very few experienced de
fensive halfbacks and are somewhat
thin at the safety position.
It is impossible to predict what a
team as young and inexperienced
as the California team of 1950 will
do under game conditions. We will
inevitably lose some games, but I
am confident that our team will be
most interesting to work with n
to watch, and I know they wil! ac
cept the responsibility of represent
ing the University of California this
fall with spirit and eagerness.
