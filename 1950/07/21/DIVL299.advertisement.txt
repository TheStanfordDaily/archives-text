/ If you had to settle for just one pair of slacks, what kind would
you choose? More and more young men are saying, "Grey
flannels. \ou can wear 'em with anything!" It's a fact! And
particularly true of these fine grey flannels designed and priced
That's right QC ky Roos especially for young Californians. Wear them at school
Y %r v 3 college with a shirt or sweater, wear them in the evening
They 're only g\ with a sports coat... wear them vacationing, golfing, dating ...
wear them anywhere, because they are always in good taste,
always comfortable. Every pair is 100% wool flannel, full cut,
with deep pleats; saddle-stitched side seams, continuous waist
band. We had them made for youths, but they're a wonderful
buy for any man who can still slip into sizes 28-38.
