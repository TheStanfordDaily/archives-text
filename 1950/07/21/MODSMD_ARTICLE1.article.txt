# Pie-Induction Call Goes Out: Santa Clara County Quota 180
## 
### 
The first pre - induction physical
examination call of Californiums
since the Korean crisis went out
yesterday from State Selective
Service Director Kenneth Leitch.
It was a call for G,OOO men. From
that number will come the 1,137
Californians who must be inducted
into the Army by September 30
The 6,000 men will be examined
between August 7 and August 29—

at San Francisco, Sacramento, Fres
no, San Diego, and Los Angeles.
• [n announcing county-by-county
breakdowns, Colonel Leitch stressed
that "This is not an induction call."
Los Angeles County will be asked
to supply 2,254 men. Other coun
ty quotas range down to 4 for Del
Norte. Santa Clara County's quota
is 13), San Mateo County's, 111.
Colonel Leitch was asked by
newsmen if it will be necessary to

•>
go below the 25-vear-old age group
(the oldest now subject to the draft)
to get 6,000 men through the physi
cal test to determine if they are
1-A.
"'Oh, yes," said the colonel.
He predicted that in seme boards
the 22-year-olds might be processed.
"Those who are found physically
fit," explained the colonel, 'will
I receive a notice from the armed
, services that they are fit for serv
ice." But they will return home to
1 wait. Those not needed to supply
the initial quota of 1,187 will go into
a poo! to be tapped when later calls
! are made for California inductions.


STRING PHONE LINES — While curious South Korean civilians
watch, U.S. Army Signal Corpsmen string telephone lines in an effort
to improve communications between the fighting front and rear line
headquarters positions.
