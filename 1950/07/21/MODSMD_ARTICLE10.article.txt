## History—1950 
### 
Far six months, Senator Joseph McCarthy lias been ranting and raving
about Communists in the United States State Department. But, at last, it
seems that his witch hunt has ended.
A subcommittee oi' five Senators—three Democrats and two Republi
cans—has been investigating the case ever since McCarthy first began
shocking the nation with his charges last February.
Since February, McCarthy, using catch words and scare-type propa
ganda in his effort to stir the country into a fever pitch and set it off on
a hysterical lynching party of alleged Communists, has been picking on
anybody he could find in the State Department who had the slightest
bit of haze in his background.
Tuesday, the case came to a harsh and grinding halt when the com
mittee issued a report on what they had found.
They condemned McCarthy in language that ranks with the fiercest
Senators have ever used against another Senator. They called him a
liar, they said his whole case was "a hoax and a fraud."
Not to be outdone for a minute, McCarthy came right back with even
stronger stuff. He said the majority report was "gigantic in its fraud and
deep in its deceit ... a green light to the Red Column in the United
States."
"The most loyal stooges of the Kremlin could not have done a better
job of giving a clean bill of health to Stalin's fifth column," McCarthy
blasted.
I wonder if Mr. McCarthy himself isn't about the most effective agent
the Kremlin has in the United States. Using Communist techniques, he
has played into the hands of the Russian bosses who would just love to see
America split by political factions—just love to see us start a campaign
aimed at ousting some of our best men from the government.
At a time when this country is involved in the Korean fight, and maybe
headed for a world showdown, the Americans have been divided in their
thinking about the people who run their government.
Such a predicament makes us easy prey for another power. We begin
to lose our heads, grasp for any light in the darkness, and often end up
following a strong leader, no matter who he is or what he represents.
True, some Americans have said that this is just good-natured party
bickering, common to our democracy which is based on the idea of two
political parties—a party in power and an opposition that is always ready
to take over when the other party falls. But these attacks on the State
Department officials by McCarthy are not friendly nor are they confined
to party lines—they are down-to-earth accusations of treason, a crime
that is punishable by a long prison sentence or death in time of war.
If we want to effectively mass together and fight the Communist
aggression—and we all know that the only effective way to fight is as
a united body—then we have got to pull together as one nation, a nation
that has trust in its top men, and a nation that can feel its executives
are working for the interests of the people.
We can be pretty sure that McCarthy's charges \v#re just shots in the
dark and, at the moment, hold about as much water as a leaky sieve. It's
time we locked the Senator in a secluded room with sound-proof walls
where he can rant and rave to his heart's content whi.e the rest of the
country units to fight the forces of aggression.
