Where's the Fundamental Standard?

To the Editor:
Thursday, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., someone took my
copy of "Complete Shakespeare." Cambridge edition, from the book rack
in the Main Library.
Unfortunately, the laws of decency do not allow me to say in print what
I actually think of the person who stoops to such a low degree in stealing
from a fellow student. However, my opinion of such an action can readily
be imagined by anyone who has suffered a similar loss, particularly when
one works for his books, room, etc.
In the past, I have been naive enough to believe that here the use of
the Fundamental Standard was an indication of the general honesty and
integrity of the students attending school;* today's experience has served
to reverse my opinion. It is now apparent to me that this is just another
school harboring its quota of vermin which apparently infest every cam
pus, making a mockery of the principle of honor to which the majority
attempt to adhere.
