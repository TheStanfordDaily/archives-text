YANK REINFORCEMENTS LAND—Two new U.S. divisions joined
the battle in Korea. The famed First Cavalry Division (motorized
infantry) made amphibious landing at Pohang (1) and units of the
25th "Infantry arc already in action. A Communist thrust at Tacjon
(2) was beaten off with heavy Red losses and the U.S. consolidated
its lines in that area. The First Cavarly fanned north and west and is
expccted to meet enemy near Yongdofl (.'5). Landing was designed to
block Reds from pushing toward supply port of Pusan (4) or from
outflanking new U.S. secondary defense line in Tachek Mountains
