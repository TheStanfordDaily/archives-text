# Paper Relates Korea Trouble

### 
WASHINGTON, July 20 (UP)—
An American white paper charged
tonight that Russia has been caus
ing trouble in Korea for five years,
and said the North Korean invasion
was "a brutal blow to the peace of
the world."
The 80-page paper traced Rus
sia's„ long record of obstruction in
Korea, and detailed the strong in
ternational backing for America and
United Nations intervention in the
Korean war.
The white paper emphasized that
the 38th parallel was never intended
to be a permanent barrier between
North and South Korea.
At the end of World War 11, when
Japan surrendered suddenly, Rus
sia was to accept the surrender of
Japanese troops north of the paral
lel and the United States to do the
same south of the line, the white
paper said. That is all the division
was intended for.
"It soon became apparent that the
division of Korea for surrender pur
poses was to be arbitrarily inter
preted by the Soviet authorities as
creating a permanent delineation
between two military zones, pas
sage between which was possible
only by permission of the military
commanders," the white paper said.
"This situation continued despite
persistent efforts of the United
States commander to negotiate ar
rangements with his Soviet coun
terpart with a view to re-establish
ing the essential unity of the coun
try."
From then on until the Soviets an
nounced they had ended their occu
pation in December, 1949, the Rus
sians thwarted every attempt at
Soviet - American co-opcration, the
State Department said.
The white paper did not directly
charge Russia with instigating the
Communist invasion of South Ko
rea. It included the Soviet-Ameri
can exchange of notes in which
Russia rejected this country's re
quest that she use her influence to
get the North Korean Communists
to halt their attack.
