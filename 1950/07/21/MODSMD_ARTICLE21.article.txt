# Tydings Blasts McCarthy Before Crowded Senate

### 
WASHINGTON, July 20 (UP)—Sen. Millard E. Tydings, D„ Md.,
accused Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R., Wis., of "vile" conduct today
and challenged Senators to "search your consciences" and decide
what should be done about it.
In one of the bitterest personal castigations ever delivered on the

| Senate floor, Tydings accused Mc- |
j Carthy of deliberately lying about
j Communist infiltration of the State
Department.
While he did not offer a formal
j resolution of censure, Tydings told
the Senate it "might well ponder"
J disciplinary action against McCar
thy if it ''has any idea of maintain
ing its integrity."
His angry speech, which drew i
loud applause from Democratic j
i Senators and the packed visitors 1 j
; galleries, came after a straight party
line vote had permitted Tydings to
file a report branding McCarthy's 1
charges "a fraud and a hoax."
McCarthy later said that Tydings
! had tried to notify Communists in j
' government "they are safe in their :
; positions." He said he wanted to
assure them, however, that they are
i not safe.

said. "That means two down and 79
J to go. The others will he dug out
one by one regardless of how fran
! tically Tydings screams for their
| protection."
He identified the two "cases" as
William W. Remington, former
Commerce Department economist
indicted for perjury on charges that
he lied about Communist party
membership, and an unnamed per
son who, McCarthy said, was forced
J to resign because of his charges.
The report was issued earlier this
week by three Democratic members
I of a Senate Foreign Relations sub-
S committee headed by Tydings. It
spent five months investigating Mc-
Carthy's accusations against various
State Department officials and oth
j ers. Republican members of the
I subcommittee refused to sipn the
| report, and denounced the investi
gation as superficial.
As the afternoon wore on. ten
sion in the chamber ran so high that
| Senate GOP Leader Kenneth S.
Wherry, Neb., once almost came to
blows with Edward P. Morgan,
chief counsel for the subcommittee
and a Democratic appointee.
At the outset, Tydings attempted
i —possibly for the first time in the
Senate's history — to play on the
| floor a phonograph record of Mc
| Carthy's original charges to show
how the Wisconsin Senator later

| changed them. Wherry blocked the
attempt.
The radio address was made at
Wheeling, W. Va., last February 8,
and touched off the whole furore.
Tydings said McCarthy then
claimed 205 Communists worked for
the State Department, only to claim
later that he mentioned only SI
"pro - Communists." This, Tyc.ings
] said, was "dcceitful."
He added that there was ''not an
ounce of truth" to the charges in the
SI "cases" McCarthy finally handed
the investigators.
"That is why I say a hoax and a
fraud was perpetrated," Tydings
i shouted, "and by the eternal God
j it's true."
Tydings also accused McCarthy of
"foul and vile" attacks on innocent
persons, and of slinging "mud,
slime, and filth.".
McCarthy's campaign, he told the
Senate, was backed "by men of lit —
i tie character preferring to serve
j their own interests rather than
those of the country."
