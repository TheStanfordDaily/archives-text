# Top Communist Brass Assembles in Berlin

### 
BERLIN. July 20 — Top brass of
Communist Europe and Red China
assembled today for what appeared
to be an important Cominform
meeting under the cover of a Com
munist party convention.
Communist representatives from
18 nations—many of them bigwigs
in the Moscow-directed Cominform
—came here ostensibly for today's
opening of the third annual conven
tion of East Germany's Socialist
Unity (Communist) party. It was
the biggest gathering of Red lead
ers since the outbreak of the Ko
rean war.
The meeting came as Cominform
pressure was being stepped up
against Yugoslavia, bitter foe of the
Soviet bloc.
It also came less than 4S hours
after the United Nations committee
on the Balkans warned UN Secre
tary General Trygve Lie that the
Cominform may be planning an at
tack on Greece.
For several weeks there have
been reports of troop movements
and border security measures in
Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, all
good Cominform members and
neighbors of Greece or Yugoslavia.
There was also a report from
Karlsbad, Czechoslovakia, that So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vi
shinsky had cut short a vacation of
early two months at that health
resort and had left for an undis
closed spot. It was the first news of
Vishinsky since mid-May.
There was no indication, however,
that Vishinsky was in Berlin.

j These events indicated to wary
Western observers that the many
leaders of the international Red or
ganization here probably had been
drawn to Berlin by more than the
Socialist Unity congress.
Among the Red notables arriving,
purportedly for the party conven
tion. were Russia's M. R. Suslov and
P. N. Pospelov. Suslov is secretary
of the Russian Communist party's
central committee and is Russia's
Cominform delegate.
Italy's Communists were repre
sented by Palmiro Togliatti and
France's Reds by Jacques Duclos,
both prominent figltres at previous
Cominform sessions.
Other arrivals were:
Wans Chia Hsiang of the Chinese
Communist central committee, Pre
! mier Josef Cyrankiedicz and Jakub
Berman of Poland's Communist po
litburo, Josef Revai of Hungary,
Foreign Minister Mintsche Neitchev
of Bulgaria, Deputy Premier Vasile
Luca of Romania, and Josef Frank
! of Czechoslovakia.
