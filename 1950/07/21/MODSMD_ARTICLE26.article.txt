# Super-Bazookas Rushed to Front; Stop Red Tanks

TOKYO, July 20 (UP) —American
know-how made the first big chink
in Soviet-built armor today.
The kind of ingenuity that pro
vides men with potent weapons
looking like stovepipes was respon
sible for the destruction of eight,
and posibly a total of 12 armor
plated, Soviet - built tanks outside
Taejon this morning.
Douglas Mac Arthur said the new
super-bazooka, which fires 3.5-inch
rockets, proved in the battle that it
can penetrate any armored vehicle
now known, whether standing still
or moving at a rate of 40 miles an
hour.
Mac Arthur said the weapon
which hit the North Koreans where
it hurt worst was made in the
United Slates, shipped to Korea, and
placed in the hands of American
fighting men only a few days after
it became apparent that the weap
ons they had were ineffective
against the Russian-built war ma
chines.
The men who fired the new 3.5-
inch rocket - launchers received
them only a short time before they
were thrown into the defense of
Taejon.
The new weapon projects shells
23 inches long. It is fired from the
shoulder. With a handle-grip on
the underside of the barrel, it is
loaded from the rear with a finned
projectile which has a shaped
charge that explodes when it hits
its mark.
The new launcher is a two-piece,
smooth - bore, electrically operated
weapon of the open tube type. It
has no recoil. Unlike the junior ba
zooka, it has an attached monopod
and bipod for stabilization when
fired while lying down.
Despite its size, it weighs only a
few pounds more than the older
version. The rockets weigh slightly
more than eight pounds, and their
war heads contain powerful explo
sives shaped to enable the projec
tile to penetrate any armored ve
hicle now known.
