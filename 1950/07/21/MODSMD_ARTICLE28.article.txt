SAN FRANCISCO. July 20 (UP)
— General Dwight D. Eisenhower
said today (hat use of the atom
bomb in Korea "might be consid
ered" if it were needed against
strictly military targets.
He told a press conference, how
ever. that "I would not use it
against personnel.''
Eisenhower also said that it may
be necessary lo fight the North Ko- 1
reans beyond the 38th parallel to
finally defeat them, but that he did
not believe such acti on would
"bring Russia into the war."
In answer to a question as to the
possible use of the atomic bomb in
Korea, the World War II supreme [
commander of Allidd forces in Eu
rope said:
If U.S. commanders "find reason J
for using it against materiel, air
fields. and warehouses—and if \Ve
could use it without, I might say,
'cutting off' human beings, then its
use might be considered."
Eisenhower said. "I don't know
where the point will be to which we ,
will have to go to defeat the enemy.
If he will stay in the south until he
can be beaten, we need go no fur
ther."
Wherever the deciding battle is
fought, Eisenhower said, "we must
not fail. To fail in that area would
be the occasion for the outburst of
sifilar or worse incidents thruogh
out the areas controlled by the
Communists. I see them as a sullen
weight leaning against the bounda
ries all over Asia."
