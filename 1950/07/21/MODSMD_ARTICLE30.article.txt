# Stanford Fire Department Run By Student Volunteers
## 
### 
The Stanford Fire Depai'tment is
a unique organization. Outside of
; six regular fire fighters on a full
time basis, the department is
manned entirely by students.
The 12 volunteers live in a bunk
room on the second floor of the i
! house, cook their meals if they de- I
| sire in a small kitchen, and study in j
| special study rooms on the first J

floor. For their efforts, they receive |
free room rent plus $20 a month. In
addition, most of the stidents hash
at Encina or Lagunita, so theii liv
ing costs are cut to a minimum. j
Six students are always on duty |
at the house and they are all on 1
constant call. If the alarm goes off
during class, they leave on the run J
for the Firehouse or the fire,, de
pending on which is closer.
Every Saturday, they report for
drill and practice with the hoses. ,
ladders, and other equipment. The j
department used to have a drill j
tower next to the present hose tow
er, but it became too rickety and
had to be torn down.
Life is not all work at the Fire
house, and the firemen have one of |
the best intramural sports records j
on the campus, as their case of tro- j
phies shows.
