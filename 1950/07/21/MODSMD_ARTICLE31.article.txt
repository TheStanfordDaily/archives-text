# Fire Losses Kept Low at Stanford Thanks to Generous Student Support
## 
### 
Stanford's fire loss is well below
the nation's average. This fact is
attributed to generous support by
students and other campus resi
dents.
In 1949 Stanford had a fire loss of

$3,354.41, which is low when com
pared with the $700,000,000 fire
losses for the entire nation.
In spite of our excellent record,
Stanford should be continually on
the alert to eliminate fire hazards,
and thus keep the loss and damage
low.
