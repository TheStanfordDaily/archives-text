NEW YORK. July 20 (UP)-The
Boston Red Sox dragged the Detroit
Tigers another half-game back to
ward the American League field to
day as they spotted Art Houtteman
a 5 to 0 lead and came on to win,
6 to 5, in 11 innings.
The Boston victory cut Detroit's
lead over the second - place New
York Yankees to two and a half
games and put the pressure of their
three-game series opening here to
morrow squarely on the Tigers. A
victory today would have assured
the Tigers of first place Sunday
night even if the Yankees sweep the
three - game set. Now the Tigers
must win at least one game to hold
the lead.
Brilliant relief pitching by Chuck
Stobbs and Ellis Kinder, who com
bined to shut out the Tigers with
one hit over the last eight innings,

gave Red Sox power a chance to
whittle away Houtteman's long lead.
The Sox finally drew even on Vern
Stephens' ninth-inning single which
scored Billy Goodman with Houtte
man only one out from victory.
They won the 11th on Dom DiMag
gio's double which also counted
Goodman.
As a result of the victory, the Red
Sox found themselves in essentially
the same position as they were
when they began their big drive a
year ago. They are still in fourth
place today — whereas they were
third a year ago—but their first
place deficit is the same, Bli>8 l i> games.
Two years ago they were in third
place. 4 l u games out of first place, at
a corresponding stage of the race.
The Pittsburgh Pirates outslug-
the Philadelphia Phillies, 10 to
8, in the only other major league

i game this afternoon. Ralph Kiner
j blasted his 27th homer to pace Pitts
burgh's IG-hit attack on five pitch
ers. The Pirates routed rookie sen
j sation Bob Miller in four and a third
J innings, but the loss was pinned on
i Slix Donnelly.
Cleveland was at Philadelphia
! and Chicago at Washington in
; American League arc-lighters while
the New York Giants were at St.
Louis and the Brooklyn Dodgers at
Cincinnati for a twi-night affair.
