# Yauks Abandon Taejon; Reserve Call is Started
## National Guard Units Will Report Shortly 
### 
WASHINGTON. July 20 (UP)—The Army
alerted more men for movement to the Far East
today and the Navy and Marines began mo
bilizing their reserves to reinforce Americans
fighting in Korea.
In a series of rapid-fire mobilization orders

aimed at putting the military serv
ices on a "ready" basis:
I—The Army notified an undis
closed number of regular units in
all six Army areas to get ready to
move to the Far East "in the near
future."
2—The Marine Corps called all of
its reserve ground units to active
duty. No immediate decision was
reached on reserve Marine airmen.
—The Navy ordered "several" of
its organized air reserve squadrons
to report immediately.
4—An Army call for some Na
tional Guard units was reported im
minent. The states have assured the
National Guard Bureau their men
are ready to go. but Guard officers
said they do not want their regular
divisions broken up.
The moves were some of the
strongest yet taken to mobilize the
nation's military to drive the Com
munist invaders out of South Korea
and reinforce this nation and its
free allies against possible Red ag
gression elsewhere.
In line with Mr. Truman's policy
of keeping the Soviets guessing
about new defense moves, none of
the services said how many men
or how much equipment was in
volved.
But it meant that the armed
forces, for the first time since the
war began, were finding it neces
sary to dip into the ranks of mar
ried reservists—many with children
—to fill the gaps in their ranks.
The military services announced
that reservists called for active
duty will be "permitted" to com
plete a minimum of one year in
uniform.
