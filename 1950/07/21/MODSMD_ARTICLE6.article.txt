Dean, commanding general of the
24th Division, was unofficially re
ported today to be missing in ac
tion in the battle of Taejon. Dean
was last seen yesterday fighting
Communist tanks with a forward
bazooka squad.
A dispatch from Peter Kalischer,
a United Press correspondent in
Korea, said a volunteer rescue col
umn that included five tanks
plunged into the Communist ranks
last night in an unsuccessful at-

tempt to find Dean and pull out
American troops believed to have
been cut off from the rest of the
U.S. force.
"The rescue attempt failed," Kal
ischer said.
'"It is impossible to say just what
caused the failure. The volunteers
had hoped to find Dean and get him
back to the new positions."
Dean's interpreter. who was
wounded in the fighting, arrived at
the main American line and said
that the last time he saw the gen
eral he was "fighting like a tiger."
