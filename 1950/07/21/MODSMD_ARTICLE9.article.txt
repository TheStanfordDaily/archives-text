Wednesday will be a day long to remember in the history of
the United States. It was the day on which President Truman
formally admitted that we are no longer interested in merely eco
nomically and psychologically stopping the forces of Commu
nism; we are now interested in physically stopping their march.
The new war plans do not pertain especially to Korea, although
this is the immediate objective —the new plans are set up on a
long-range basis to raise the country into a position where it can
actively resist Russian armies any time, any place in the world.
How these plans will affect Stanford, at the moment, no one
knows. As soon as we can get anything definite, we will publish
the information in The Daily for all concerned. Until something
definite is announced, though, we can only sit and wait.
But we do know that the era of false peace has ended -no longer
do we have to try and maintain "business as usual." The United
States is going all out, economically, psychologically, and mili
tarily to resist the forces of Communism, and we will not be
stopped. The cards are on the table; the fight has just begun.
