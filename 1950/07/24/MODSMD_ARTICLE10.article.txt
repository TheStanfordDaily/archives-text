## Open the RBR? 
### 
Do you want the library open on weekend nights?
At the moment, the Main Library, including the Reserve Book
Room, closes Friday and Sunday at 5 p.m. and Saturday at 4 p.m.
This presumes that nobody wants to use the libe on these nights.
Considering that most courses reguire a lot of reading from books
available only at the Reserve Book Room, we wonder if this isn't a
pretty sweeping assumption.
Acting Director of the Library Fred J. Priddle said he would be
glad to open the RBR on weekend nights if there was enough de
mand by the students for the use of the room. We think there is
this demand, but, to be sure, we would like to conduct a poll among
the student body and see how they feel.
So, if you want the library open on either one or all of these
uights, clip tbe coupon from the bottom of this column and mail
or bring it to the Daily Shack. If the response indicates the need
for opening the RBR at these times, Mr. Priddle will be more than
willing to make-the necessary arrangements.
How about it, do you want the libe open on weekend nights?
