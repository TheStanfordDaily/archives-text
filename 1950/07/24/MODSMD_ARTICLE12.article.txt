Should a schoolteacher be allowed to expound Charles Darwin's theory
jf evolution to his students?
Twenty-five years ago a young biology teacher named John Charles
Scopes, believing in freedom for teachers, made the experiment in Dayton,
Tenn. Haled into court, he let Clarence Darrow, the famous criminal law
yer, argue his case against the elderly but still eloquent William Jennings
Bryan.
The trial, which amounted to a philosophical debate between two bril
liant orators, attracted nation-wide attention. Scopes himself became al
most lost in the shuffle, as judge, lawyers, and audience became engrossed
in the argument on evolutoin.
Th» teacher was at length found guilty of teaching heresy in a public
school, fined $100 by the State of Tennessee, and sent back to his teaching.
Now a geologist in Shreveport. La., Scopes still believes in Darwin and
.•onsiders that he was unjustly fined by the State of Tennessee.
But Tennessee still has a law against teaching Darwin's theory in
public schools.

Ten billion dollars will be needed for public school construction in the
next decade, according to a recent estimate issued by the National Educa
tion Association.
Increased construction has become necessary for two main reasons,
says NEA. The more obvious one is the high enrollment, which is ex
pected to grow even greater.
V less publicized reason is the lag in school consruction during the
past thirty years. At least one-third of present city school buildings were
erected prior to 1900. Today's children are thus crowding into classrooms
formerly attended by their grandparents.
The cost of constructing school plants has also risen during the past
fifty years. Frame buildings have given way to steel and concrete struc
tures, and fireproofing has become a dominant practice. The modern plant
is more extensive than the old ones, incorporating such additions as school
offices, laboratories, gymnasiums, clinics, shops, and other special rooms
for auxiliary school services.
The lag in construction, states NEA. began with the doubling of prices
in the 1920'5. Then came the depression, during which time no funds were
ivailable. World War II soon followed with new demands for public
money. After the war skyrocketing prices continued to deter school con
struction.
Willard E. Givens, NEA executive secretary, declares that the United
States can afford more money for public instruction. In 1930, 3.09 per cent
of our national income was being spent for this purpose, while in 1950 the
ratio has decreased to 1.84.
Givens further points out that added responsibilities have been allotted
o public schools. The modern era is demanding more and more technical
nnd scientific ability. The public school is therefore compelled to expand
in order to train youth for this demand.
