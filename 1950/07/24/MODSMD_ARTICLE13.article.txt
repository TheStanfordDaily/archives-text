YANK ANSWER TO RED TANKS—Three American soldiers, manning a new recoilless rifle, crouch in
a foxhole on the Korean front. The weapon is similar to the armor-piercing rocket launcher that has
stopped the Reds' heavy tanks. Left to right: Sgt. George Moolki, Kekaha, T.H.; Cpl. Berry Burke, Har
lan. Ky. 112 and Pfc. Alvin Ba»pa, Union City, Ohio.
