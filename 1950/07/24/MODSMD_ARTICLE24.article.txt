# Bobby Rosburg Ekes Win In Stanford Golf Tourney
## 
### 
Bob Rosburg, ex-Stanford links
star, scored his fourth tournament
win in the past three weeks by
capturing the Twelfth Annual
Stanford Invitational Tournament
Saturday despite a ragged finish.
His scores were 72-70-74 for a
216 total in the 54-hole medal play.
Rosburg, after burning up the
course on the first nine with a 3
under par 33, almost cracked on the
back nine as he piled up 41 strokes,
G over par, to post his 74 today.
One stroke back with 217 scores
were Tal Smith of Alameda, four
times champ of the tourney, and
Ken Towns, former National Public
Links king. They blew chances to
catch Rosburg when they missed
easy shots on the seventeenth and
eighteenth greens.
Cy Fennel, Palo Alio service sta
tion operator, finished fourth with
scores of 70-73-75—218.
Dick McElyea, Stanford junior
who was winner of the individual
title in the PCC golf tournament
this year, finished in sixth place.
The final 18 holes were played on
the long tees, which accounted for
the higher scores in Saturdya's play.
