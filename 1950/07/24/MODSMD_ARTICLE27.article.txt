# New Fight Predicted to Fire 40 Profs Refusing to Sign UC Loyalty Affirmation
## 
### 
Forty high-ranking professors at
the University of California have
their jobs today despite their refu
sal to sign contracts disavowing
Communism.
But their opponents promise a
new fight to unseat them.
The decision to keep 159 of the
professors was made in a 10-9 vote
of the university Board of Regents
Friday with Governor Earl Warren
casting the deciding vote.
The 40th man was approved later
when university President Robert
Gordon Sproul was advised still an
other overlooked professor awaited
action.
The balloting climaxed a heated,
three-hour discussion with opposi

tion to the professors led by John ,
Francis Neylan, San Francisco at
torney. Neylan promised the re
gents he would bring up the mat
ter again at the next meeting.
The professors, whose reasons for
not signing had been approved by
a special faculty committee, are
now to sign special contracts in
which Communism is disavowed for
them by the Regents.
Contracts to be sent out to these :
nonsigners will carry the words
"the condition of your employment
is that YOU are not a member of j
the Communist party" instead of'
the affirmation "I am not a member
of the Communist party."
Six members of the university's
Academic Senate, who failed to win
committee approval, were dismissed
by the Regents. These professors
were not accused of Communist ,
sympathies, but rather of having J
failed to "co-operate" with the ex
amining committee.
Six teaching assistants were dis
missed on similar grounds.
None of the 12 was named.
It was explained that these 12 had I
failed to explain their attitudes rel
ative to Communism and thus had
not complied with the Regents' pol- |
icy. j
Governor Warren, who, with Ad- !
miral Chester W. Nimitz, voted with I

the majority group for retention of
the 39, called for acceptance of
SprouPs recommendation.
"Are we interested in maintain
ing our pride as to the form of the
screening procedure, or in screen
ing Communists?" the Governor
asked.
"If we are interested in screening
Communists and if there is sub
stantial evidence that any one of
these persons is a Communist, I
have no doubt that every Regent
would vote against his retention.
"The question is, have any of us
any evidence that any one of them
is a Communist? If so. lei's have it.
If not, then acept the recommenda
tion of President Sproul.
