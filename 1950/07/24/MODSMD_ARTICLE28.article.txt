# Statement by UC Academic Group
## 
### 
Friday afternoon six California
professors were sacrificed to save
the jobs of 40 others. While it is
encouragnig that 40 have been tem
porarily saved, the academic world
must deplore the fate of their six
colleagues as a new and shocking
setback to the cause of academic
reedom.
No charges have been bruoght
against the discharged professors.
The sole reason given for their dis
missal was that they refused to pre
sent evidence to convince the Com
mittee on Privilege and Tenure that
they were not Communists. Thus
their firing is a violation of the
basic American right t obe consid
ered innocent until proved guilty.
Furthermore, it violates the prin
ciple upon which our secret ballot
xs basedâ€”the principle that a man's
political views are a private matter.
The Academic Assembly is con
cerned also for the fate of about SO
lower faculty members who ap
peared for hearings but were not
discussed at the meeting. Some
have passed through the hearings
with clearance only to have their
pay stopped this summer. Must we
assume that their hearings mean
nothing and that they must sign or
get out?
Finally, it should be carefully
noted that the retention ot even
the 40 professors is by no means as
sured. Regent Neylan's move to re
consider in the next meeting sug
gests that this assault on human
freedom has not yet spent itself.
The Academic Assembly will con
tinue to work against this assault
and will carry its case into the
courts of the state of California.
