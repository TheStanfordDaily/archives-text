'The Hasty Heart," one of the
most successful comedy-dramas of

Scot who was the inspiration for
Lachlan, the Scot in the play. Pat

I port.
Besides the Scot, the patients in
[ the hospital include an American,
ian Englishman, an Australian, a
New Zealander. and a Basuto (Af
rican) native, providing a wide va-
I riety of characterizations.

| Heart" are designed by Marvin
Chomsky, one of the three Junior
Artists -in - Residence at Stanford
