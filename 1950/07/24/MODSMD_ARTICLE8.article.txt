# No New Draft Plans: Tydings

### 
WASHINGTON. July 23 (UP) —
Chairman Millard E. Tydings of the
Senate Armed Services Committee
said today there are no plans now
to throw the draft "wide open" un
less the Korean fighting flares into
World War 111.
The Maryland Democrat made
the statement as an Air Force
spokesman told reporters at a Pen
tagon briefing session that Con
gress will be informed either to
morrow or Tuesday what the Air
Force intends to do about its re
serves.
He refused to comment on re
ports that organized Air Force re
serves will be called to active duty
early this week. But he did say
that military leaders, as far as he
knows, have not discussed calling
up the inactive reserve.
The Marine Corps said it is call
ing some reserve squadrons to ac
tive duty to bring existing groups
to full strength. A spokesman em
phasized, however, that the over-all
number of Marine squadrons is not
being increased at this time.
The Air Force has about 85,000
officers and men organized into
units, of which about half are in
the National Guard. All told, there
are about 400.000 Air Force re
serves.
The Army already has called up
some National Guard and reserve
units, and the Navy has summoned
at least 12 reserve air squadrons as
well as individual reserves. The
Marine Corps has called up all
of its estimated 47.000 organized
ground reserves.
Tydings indicated in a broadcast
over Station WBAL. Baltimore,
that the number of men taken into
the armed forces through Selective
Service will be relatively small if
the war is confined to Korea. The
Army has issued a draft call for
20,000 men and another call is ex
pected next month.
As for the National Guard, Tyd
ings said the present plan is to
"alert and call out certain divisions
and elements" but not all of it—
only "enough to make a good, big
reserve in case of need."
He said the men will receive ad
ditional training and "may not be
sent abroad."
