## History—l950 
### 
I ju»» got back from a two-hour trip through the San Jose Draft Board
arid the Army, Navy, and Air Force recruiting offices. What I found
wasn't pleasant and a lot of students here at Stanford aren't going to like
it—but facts are facts and we might as well face 'em.
To start with the draft situation.
If you arc a senior, from age 25 down to about 22, not a veteran, and
unmarried as of this weekend—you can pretty well count on being in
(the first call. The exact bottom age limit hasin't been set down; it will
go to the 23-year-olds and lower if there are a lot of exemptions in the
upper brackets. Notices will be sent out to 72 1-A's in the Palo Alto
area late this week, and recipients of these notices will be ordered to
report on August 14 for a pre-induction physical. Then, if they are ac
ceptable to the Army, they will report for duty on or about September 5.
That's three days after the last final.
How does the machinery work? There are three main steps:
1. On your eighteenth birthday, you register with the local board and
they, after due consideration, mail you a notice of classification.
t. The local board, receiving its quota, puts your name on a list, strictly
by age classification, and eventually you are called up for service. You
*re sent a pre-induction notice, the one reading: "Greetings, the Presi
dent . . ." Under the present call, the notices will tell you to be at the
San Jose bus depot at 7:35 a.m. August 14 or go directly to the Presidio
by 9:45 a.m. There you will be examined mentally and physically.
3. If you pass, you are given 21 days to settle your affairs before re
porting for active duty.
There are a million and one details that have to be ironed out—a lot
of individual problems that have to be settled by each dralt board, but
here are a few of the exemptions and deferments as listed by Mrs. Lilian
Krigbaum, director of the Santa Clara County District:
1. Students, who are already enrolled up to the time they receive their
'third notice—the order to report for active duty—are deferred till the
and of the academic year. In the above case, this is the notice that would
arrive around August 15 after successful completion of the physical.
Thus, if the registration for autumn quarter is on September 25 and
if. on September 26, you receive your notice to report for active duty,
you will be allowed to finish the school year. It makes no difference when
you receive your classification card or your pre-induction physical no
tice, the final order to report is the one that counts.
However, when you do receive any notice from the draft board, classi
fication or physical notice, go immediately to Mr. Waterous, assistant
counselor for men, and get a letter stating that you are enrolled in a
full course of study and that you would like to be deferred till the end
of the ynar.
2. Married men, who were married before they received their pre
induction notice, may be deferred for the time being, depending on the
action of the local board. No rules have been sent out from Washington
on this problem, and the individual boards consider each case separately.
Actually, no board is going to defer a youth who gets married the day-
After he receives his pre-induction notice.
3. Medical students, enrolled in medical school (not pre-meds) and
dental students will be deferred till the end of their instruction, accord
ing to the quota allotted to the particular school. This is all handled by
the medical schools and the War Department.
4. If you want to enlist, you may do so any time up until you receive
your notice to report for the first physical, but that is another story which
I will cover in this column Friday.
What's the outlook for the future? Not very good. The Selective Serv
ice System is just getting into high gear—they have activatel a tremen
dous amount of machinery—they aren't going to stop now. All reports
indicate that there will be another call for more draftees any time be
tween now and the end of August. How many they call is something
else, but it looks as if this call for 20.0W is just the first of a long strin?
of similar requests.

'third notice—the order to report for active duty—are deferred till the
and of the academic year. In the above case, this is the notice that would
arrive around August 15 after successful completion of the physical.
Thus, if the registration for autumn quarter is on September 25 and
if. on September 26, you receive your notice to report for active duty,
you will be allowed to finish the school year. It makes no difference when
you receive your classification card or your pre-induction physical no
tice, the final order to report is the one that counts.
However, when you do receive any notice from the draft board, classi
fication or physical notice, go immediately to Mr. Waterous, assistant
counselor for men, and get a letter stating that you are enrolled in a
full course of study and that you would like to be deferred till the end
of the ynar.
2. Married men, who were married before they received their pre
induction notice, may be deferred for the time being, depending on the
action of the local board. No rules have been sent out from Washington
on this problem, and the individual boards consider each case separately.
Actually, no board is going to defer a youth who gets married the day-
After he receives his pre-induction notice.
3. Medical students, enrolled in medical school (not pre-meds) and
dental students will be deferred till the end of their instruction, accord
ing to the quota allotted to the particular school. This is all handled by
the medical schools and the War Department.
4. If you want to enlist, you may do so any time up until you receive
your notice to report for the first physical, but that is another story which
I will cover in this column Friday.
What's the outlook for the future? Not very good. The Selective Serv
ice System is just getting into high gear—they have activatel a tremen
dous amount of machinery—they aren't going to stop now. All reports
indicate that there will be another call for more draftees any time be
tween now and the end of August. How many they call is something
else, but it looks as if this call for 20.0W is just the first of a long strin?
of similar requests.
I ju»» got back from a two-hour trip through the San Jose Draft Board
arid the Army, Navy, and Air Force recruiting offices. What I found
wasn't pleasant and a lot of students here at Stanford aren't going to like
it—but facts are facts and we might as well face 'em.
To start with the draft situation.
If you arc a senior, from age 25 down to about 22, not a veteran, and
unmarried as of this weekend—you can pretty well count on being in
(the first call. The exact bottom age limit hasin't been set down; it will
go to the 23-year-olds and lower if there are a lot of exemptions in the
upper brackets. Notices will be sent out to 72 1-A's in the Palo Alto
area late this week, and recipients of these notices will be ordered to
report on August 14 for a pre-induction physical. Then, if they are ac
ceptable to the Army, they will report for duty on or about September 5.
That's three days after the last final.
How does the machinery work? There are three main steps:
1. On your eighteenth birthday, you register with the local board and
they, after due consideration, mail you a notice of classification.
t. The local board, receiving its quota, puts your name on a list, strictly
by age classification, and eventually you are called up for service. You
*re sent a pre-induction notice, the one reading: "Greetings, the Presi
dent . . ." Under the present call, the notices will tell you to be at the
San Jose bus depot at 7:35 a.m. August 14 or go directly to the Presidio
by 9:45 a.m. There you will be examined mentally and physically.
3. If you pass, you are given 21 days to settle your affairs before re
porting for active duty.
There are a million and one details that have to be ironed out—a lot
of individual problems that have to be settled by each dralt board, but
here are a few of the exemptions and deferments as listed by Mrs. Lilian
Krigbaum, director of the Santa Clara County District:
1. Students, who are already enrolled up to the time they receive their
'third notice—the order to report for active duty—are deferred till the
and of the academic year. In the above case, this is the notice that would
arrive around August 15 after successful completion of the physical.
