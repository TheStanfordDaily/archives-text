# 'Death of a Salesman' Is Tragedy of Common Man
## 
### AL BERRY 
Arthur Miller's ' Death of a'
Salesman" will finish its highly j
successful San Francisco run at the j
Curran Theater next Saturday eve- 1
ning. For those who have not as
yet had the good fortune to see the
Pulitzer Prize-winning play, there
are, we are told, ample tickets.
As with all great plays, there has

been much discussion about the
"Salesman." There are those critics
who claim that it is not a tragedy—
that it is merely pathetic and lacks
the loftiness and drive that would,
class it as a tragedy of the Hamlet
and Medea stature.
Playwright Miller answers this
by saying that society has changed
and the world is no longer inter
ested in the right and justice of a
grizzled king to do this or that.
What does shake the modern au
dience, says Miller, "derives from
the underlying fear of being dis
placed, the disaster inherent in be
ing torn away from our chosen im
age of what and who we are in this
world. Among us today this fear is
as strong as and perhaps stronger
than it ever was. In fact, it is the
common man who knows this fear
best."
With this in his mind, Arthur
Miller wrote the "tragedy of the
common man," ' Death of a Sales
man." And whether it is true trag
ery or not, "Salesman* is, without
question, one of the most powerful
of alf modern dramas. Miller, for
his scripting of the play, has re
ceived many and varied awards—
the Pulitzer Prize, the Donaldson
Award, and the New York Drama

Critics' Circle Award, to name the
top three. From what we saw in
the Curran Theater, he deserved all
this and more.
"Salesman," in case no one has
told you, is a magnificent theater
achievement.
The play was originally done on
Broadway under the direction fo
the brilliant Elia Kazan (Broad
way: '"A Streetcar called Desire";
Hollywood: "Gentlemen's Agree
ment," "Boomerang") and starred
Hollywood's Lee J. Cobb.. It is hard
to imagine Cobb or anybody else
doing a better job as Willy Loman,
the lost salesman, than does Thom
as Mitchell in San Francisco's age
ing Curran.
Aside from Mitchell, the S.F. cast
is not magnificent, but it is certain
ly sufficient. With Mitchell's great
performance, Miller's all - powerful
script, and Kazan's terrific direc
tion, "Death of a Salesman" with
out doubt marks a high point in
San Francsico drama presentatoin.
Cuff Notes the Morning After:
Set design, outstanding. Darren
McGavin as Happy, very well cast.
Paul Langton as Biff, sufficient,
plays some scenes wonderfully
well, ties up on others. Looks like
Bob Mathias. June Walker as
mother: great in last act, weak in
first. Recommendation: Must see,
by all means.

to imagine Cobb or anybody else
doing a better job as Willy Loman,
the lost salesman, than does Thom
as Mitchell in San Francisco's age
ing Curran.
Aside from Mitchell, the S.F. cast
is not magnificent, but it is certain
ly sufficient. With Mitchell's great
performance, Miller's all - powerful
script, and Kazan's terrific direc
tion, "Death of a Salesman" with
out doubt marks a high point in
San Francsico drama presentatoin.
Cuff Notes the Morning After:
Set design, outstanding. Darren
McGavin as Happy, very well cast.
Paul Langton as Biff, sufficient,
plays some scenes wonderfully
well, ties up on others. Looks like
Bob Mathias. June Walker as
mother: great in last act, weak in
first. Recommendation: Must see,
by all means.

Arthur Miller's ' Death of a'
Salesman" will finish its highly j
successful San Francisco run at the j
Curran Theater next Saturday eve- 1
ning. For those who have not as
yet had the good fortune to see the
Pulitzer Prize-winning play, there
are, we are told, ample tickets.
As with all great plays, there has

been much discussion about the
"Salesman." There are those critics
who claim that it is not a tragedy—
that it is merely pathetic and lacks
the loftiness and drive that would,
class it as a tragedy of the Hamlet
and Medea stature.
Playwright Miller answers this
by saying that society has changed
and the world is no longer inter
ested in the right and justice of a
grizzled king to do this or that.
What does shake the modern au
dience, says Miller, "derives from
the underlying fear of being dis
placed, the disaster inherent in be
ing torn away from our chosen im
age of what and who we are in this
world. Among us today this fear is
as strong as and perhaps stronger
than it ever was. In fact, it is the
common man who knows this fear
best."
With this in his mind, Arthur
Miller wrote the "tragedy of the
common man," ' Death of a Sales
man." And whether it is true trag
ery or not, "Salesman* is, without
question, one of the most powerful
of alf modern dramas. Miller, for
his scripting of the play, has re
ceived many and varied awards—
the Pulitzer Prize, the Donaldson
Award, and the New York Drama

Critics' Circle Award, to name the
top three. From what we saw in
the Curran Theater, he deserved all
this and more.
"Salesman," in case no one has
told you, is a magnificent theater
achievement.
The play was originally done on
Broadway under the direction fo
the brilliant Elia Kazan (Broad
way: '"A Streetcar called Desire";
Hollywood: "Gentlemen's Agree
ment," "Boomerang") and starred
Hollywood's Lee J. Cobb.. It is hard
to imagine Cobb or anybody else
doing a better job as Willy Loman,
the lost salesman, than does Thom
as Mitchell in San Francisco's age
ing Curran.
