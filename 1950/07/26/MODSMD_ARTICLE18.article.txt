GUARDS JESSE CONE AND DICK LUCAS will probably be
Marchie Schwartz's midd!e-of-it-a!l combo come the falling of the
leaves time on the Farm. Both men are veterans of the grid campaigns.
Cone was the number one and only defensive guard on last year's live
three-two-one defense, and Lucas claimed the offensive left guard spot
next to the now graduated three-year man Don Fix.
Cone, who weighs only 185 pounds, is small for a guard, but on the
greensward is unbelievably aggressive for a human being. Cone wns
named by many sportswriters as the '"best lineman on the field" in
last fall's USC triumph, and received the Stanford "lineman of the
week" award for his defensive work in the UCLA game.
Lucas was the regular starting offensive guard for the Cards in what
was his first college football season last year. The 1!M-II>. 15-ft. 1 - in.
junior was one of the hardest blocking gentlemen on the squad last
year, and his presence goes a long way toward insuring the Redshirts
n lot of power up the middle this year.
