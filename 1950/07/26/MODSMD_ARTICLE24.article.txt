# Jackie Robinson Leads National League Batters; Kell Tops in Tight American Race
## 
### ALLAN SINDLER 
Hitting is heavy in the majors I
with both loops seeing nip-anri- j
tuck races for batting honors.
In the National League, it's a
two-man race between Brooklyn's
Jackie Robinson and St. Louis' Stan
Musial. Hobnison and Musial have
outdistanced recent challengers by
picking up 11 and 12 points respec
tively within the last week. Musial
also managed to stretch his consec
utive game hitting streak to 28.
This puts Musial within nine
games of the modern National
League record of 37, set by Tommy
Holmes of the Boston Braves in i
1945. Robinson's five hits against |
Pittsburgh Sunday gave him mar- j
gin enough to lay a reclaimer on j
the number one spot. His .367 edges
Musial's .360.
In the American, it's even closer. |
Detroit's George Kell leads his own j
teammate Hoot Evers by one point. [
But Cleveland's Larry Doby is tied :
with Evers! And don't go 'way . . .
Boston's Walt Dropo needs but one
point to make it a three-way
squeeze for the second spot.
Ke!l is sitting in the driver's seat j
for the fourth week in a row, even ;
after dropping 14 points through
last Sunday.
Kell. 1949 American League bat-

ting champion, had a lambasting
.375 three weeks ago. The tie for
runner -up resulted from Evers'
climb of 8 points and Doby's loss of
the same number. Boston's Dropo
latched on to another 10 points dur
ing the week to boast a .342.

This assist by Robinson, last
year's National League batting
champion, helped put Brooklyn to
within IV2 games of Musial's
league-leading Cardinals. Kell and
Evers are keeping Detroit out in
front in the American League,
while Doby is helping a shaky
1 Cleveland hold 011 to third plac".
Dropo isn't doing fourth-place Bcs
tno any harm, either.
