resumed bombardment of Nationalist-held Quemoy (1) and little
Kinrnen Islands. Troop-laden junks concentrated along coast, appar
ently to invade these islands. Four Communist armies were converg
ing on invasion-staging area (2) and Nationalist government at Taipeh
(3) ordered its navy and air force to act immediately if Ouemoy is
invaded. This poses problem for U.S. Seventh Fleet (I), under orders
to combat any Red invasion of Formosa.
