### 
WASHINGTON, July 25 (UP)
—The Air Force announced today
it is calling up a "very limited j
number" of its organized reserve
units to bolster its strength in the
Korean crisis.
A spokesman declined to say how
many or what types of units will be j
summoned to active duty. But it
was believed plane-equipped units
as well as service groups are in- '
volved.
There were these other develop- |
ments as the nation continued lim- j
ited mobilization to beat the North
Korean Communists and gird itself j
against other dangers:
1 'the Army froze the commis
sions of its reserve officers and
announced a voluntary recall of
lieutenants and captains in 10
service categories.
2. Secretary of the Treasury John j
VV. Snyder said the Coast Guard
will probably have to call up some
of its 4,850 reservists "at an early
date."
3. A Marine Corps spokesman
said "certain ground elements" of
the Second Marine Division at
Camp Lejeune, N.C., are being |
transferred to Camp Pendleton.

Cal. This was apparently to replace
the First Marine Division which
was sent to the Korean front from
Camp Pendleton.
4. The Air Force announced it
will begin recall of selected re
serve officers and men on an in
dividual basis. The compulsory
active duty orders will go first to
non-flying ROTC graduates, re
cently discharged reservists, and
those with particular training and
skills. All will be called lip for
one year in the grade they hold
in the reserves, and will be ,«iven
10 days to settle their affairs.
The Army announced last week it
is calling up organized reserve
units. The Navy summoned "sev
eral" of its reserve air squadrons.
The Marine Corps called up its en
tire organized ground reserve —
about 47.000 men. The Army also
called into service units of the Na
tional Guard.
Army reserve commissions are
for a five-year term, and thousands
which were issued in the 1945 de
mobilization are due to expire in
the next few months. Thj freeze
keeps them in effect indefiniately.
