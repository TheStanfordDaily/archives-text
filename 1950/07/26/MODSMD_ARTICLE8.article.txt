TOKYO, Wednesday, July 26 (UP) â€”Eight tank-tipped North Ko
rean Communist divisions smashed at the United States and South
Korean lines on three fronts today.
The United States First Cavalry Division, threatened with encir
clement, withdrew from Yongdong on the Taejon front and estab-

blished a new line three to five
miles southeast.
The United States 25th Infantry
Division was under heaviest pres
sure on the central f-ont, to the
northeast of the First Cavalry.
In the southwest, where the
Communists thrust to the extreme
tip of the Peninsula, the United
States and British navies opened
an aerial offensive in a dramatic
operation possibly portending big
ger developments.
On the east coast, in the only Al
lied advance, Gen. Douglas Mac A
rthur's United Nations troops threw
the Communists back one mile
north of Kanggu to a point two and
a hall miles south of the port of
Yongdok.
Gen. Mac Arthur, depicting the
situation on the First Cavalry and
25th Infantry fronts as it was be
fore the abandonment of Yongdong,
said:
"Stubborn United Nations forces
in the western and central sectors
continued to hold against superior
forces as of Tuedsay morning.
"Further withdrawals may be
necessary."
Mac Arthur said that on the First
Cavalry and 25th Infantry fronts,
the enemy had now in action on a
line running west to east the third,
second, fifteenth, first, eighth, sev
enth, and pai;t of the fifth divisions.
The enemy fourfli division,
equipped with tanks, is now oper
ating in southwest Korea. Mac A
rthur said.
In this area, the enemy drove to
the extreme southwest tip of thsi
peninsula, 235 miles south of the
previously captured Mokpo naval
base.
These North Koreans also cap
tured Kurye, 90 miles west of the
Allied supply base of Pusan on the
southeast coast.
The stand of the First Cavalry
and 25th Infantry divisions against
numerically superior and more
heavily armored enemy troops was
made possible only by perfect in
fantry - artillery - Air Force team
work.
The Air Force opened all-night
operations in support of the troops
in the battle line.
