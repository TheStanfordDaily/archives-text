# Veterans Administration Lists New Rules for Students Now in School and Those Planning to Attend This Fall
## 
### 
Veterans Administration yester
day issued a round-up of rules and
; regulations that should help veter
; ans plan ahead for GI Bill school
terms next fall.
The round-up includes new pro
| cedures that were prepared under
Public Law GlO. signed July 13.
VA stressed that now is the time
[ veterans should do their planning,
j because several weeks are required
j sometimes to get preliminaries out
of the way.
Veterans who intend to go ahead
| this 'fall with the same course at the
same school they've previously at
tended need not contact VA at all.
| They should, however, make cer
tain the school has room for them.
Those who want to continue in
j the same course but at a different
! school should obtain a Supplemen
i tal Certificate of Eligibility from
j VA. On the certificate, they must
[ name the school and course. Then
! they present the certificate to the
school at enrollment time.
Veterans who wish to make their
j first change from one general field
| of study to another (from law to
; engineering, for example) may do
so simply by applying for a Supple
mental Certificate of Eligibility
| from VA.
The same holds true for those
i who completed or discontinued GI
Bill training and now want to make
I a first change to a different general
j field.
Veterans who already have
| changed general fields of GI Bill
j study and now wish to change
again, should apply at their VA re
gional office. If it is determined
that the new course is in a different
general field, they will be required
to undergo advisement and guid
ance.

Purpose of advisement and guid- |
ance is to enable VA to decide j
whether a veteran has need for the j
course and aptitudes necessary to j
complete his educational or job ob
jective.
It VA doesn't come to a decision i
whether to approve or disapprove <
within 45 days after the veteran's J
application, the new course auto
matically is approved. The vet- j
eran, however, must have appeared j
at the appointed time for advise- 1
ment and guidance, and he must i
have co-operated in receiving this j
service.
Veterans who have not yet I
trained under the GI 3iK, and plan j
to start this fall, should apply at the j
nearest VA office for an original
Certificate of Eligibility. The name j
of the school and course must be j
included in the application and the i
application, together with a photo
static copy of discharge papers. ,
should be sent to the nearest VA j
regional office.
Restrictions on avocational and j
recreational GI Bill training, modi

fied slightly by the new Public Law
610. apply to all veteran trainees.
A veteran must submit complete
justification that training will con
tribute to bona fide use in his pres
ent or contemplated business or oc
cupation if he wants to take any
of the following courses:
Dancing, photography. glider,
bartending, personality develop
ment. entertainment, music, pubi.
speaking, and courses in sports and
atheltics.
Exempted are applied music,
hysical education, or public speak
ing courses offered by colleges for
credit as an integral part of a course
leading to an educational objective.
If a veteran desires a course no 1 :
on the list, but which VA finds is
frequently taken for avocational or
recreational purposes, he may take
one of two steps: (1) submit com
plete justification, or (2) submit an
affidavit, supported by corroborat
ing affidavits from two competent
disinterested persons, stating that
the training will be useful to him
in connection with earning a living.
