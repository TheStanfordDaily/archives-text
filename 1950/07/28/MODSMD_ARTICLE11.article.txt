## Leave 'em Alone 
### 
Summer is the season for fires and with the fires come the
curious on-lookers that impede the fire-fighters, both on their way
to the scene of the blaze and while they are trying to control the
conflagation;
One of the greatest concerns of any fire-fighting unit is the
difficulty in getting necessary equipment to the scene of the
trouble before the curious crowd blocks the road. Knowing that
every second counts, many cities, such as Palo Alto, go as far
as blocking off the area immediately with the aid of the police
department. Stanford tries to do this in most cases, but with the
limited personnel in both the police and fire departments, this is
not always possible.
Therefore, it becomes the duty of the students themselves to
restrain their curiosity. And remember the state law says that
you may not drive your car within 300 feet of a fire engine.
Up to this date the number of campus fires has been less than
during the average year. As the days go by, the grass becomes
drier and drier and it just invites a careless smoker to toss his
ashes and thus start a roaring blaze. The throwing of any lit
material from an automobile is forbidden by law, and this regu
lation should remind us of our responsibilities as citizens.
Let's remember to use our ash trays and to stay where we
are when the fire whistle sounds.
