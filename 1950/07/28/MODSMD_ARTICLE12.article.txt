## History—1950 
### 
As the local draft boards get set to tighten the noose on eligible men,
a glance around the various recruiting offices shows that the army and
navy, although in desperate need of trained men, are still operating under
peace-time regulations—regulations that make the various services par
ticularly uninviting for the college student trying to escape the draft.
Here's what I discovered Wednesday after tramping from one office to |
another:
Regular Army: Men from 17 to 34, unmarried, may enlist for three,
four, or six years. At the moment, they have a choice of different areas
i;nd specialized services. College graduates may apply for a commission
a'"ter they get in, or, if they are willing to take a chance with the draft,
they may apply for OCS before they enlist and wait 30 to 45 days for
acceptance. They are not draft-exempt during this waiting period. Doc
tors, dentists, and some mechanical specialists will be granted commis
sions immediately.
Army Air Force": Men from 17 to 34, unmarried, may enlist for four ;
years which includes one and a half years training and two and a half i
years active duty. Physical requirements for the air corps are very strict. '
Both the army and the air force refuse to take married men for enlist- J
ment but a soldier may get married after enlistment with the approval of
his CO.
Regular Navy: Men from 17 through 30, unmarried, may enlist for four
or six years. All recruits are sent to boot camp for preliminary training j
and then may get further specialized training. There are a few openings |
ior qualified men in the electronics field. There is little chance of get- !
ting into an officer's candidate school as the navy gets most of its officers i
from Annapolis and the NROTC. Some chance for men desiring flight
training.
Marines: Men from 17 to 30, unmarried, may sign up for four or six
years. All men are sent to boot camps for early training by platoons, and
then the individual platoons are split up and the men are sent to training
schools depending on the desires of the recruits and the need for men by
the different branches of the service. There is no chance for an enlistee
to indicate his choice before he is called, and very little opportunity to
get into OCS.
Army Reserves: Men, 18 to 35, may enlist in the reserve for three years,
while veterans, IN to 45, may enlist at their old grade. The Palo Alto
Reserve, consisting of two infantry units, has openings. They meet on
every other Monday night for training. Advancement is based on ability
and length of service.
Navy Reserve: One year enlistments for veterans only.
That's the situation as it stands now. New orders to the recruiting of- \
fices should be forthcoming soon, and probably changes will be made in
the status of married men. Also, the term of enlistment may be shortened.
But if you go in today, you are stuck for anywhere from three years j
and up; if you wait till you get drafted, you are in for 21 months and ;
longer—the longer depending on the world situation. It's a tough decision
to make, but a decision that has to be made pretty soon if a man wants to
enlist. As soon as the pre-induction draft notice arrives, then gone are
all chances for getting into the service of one's choice.
