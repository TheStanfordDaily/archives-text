A radical revolution in public education may take place in the near
iuture.
Dr. A. John Bartky, dean of the School of Education, predicts that total
mobilization and a war economy will necessitate some educational changes
more drastic than any this country has experienced before. These changes
will be rapid and positive because they will be forced upon us.
Dr. Bartky sees four staggering problems that mobilization will present
to educators:
1. Teaching more students with fewer teachers.
2. Housing more students with the. present overcrowded buildings, as
110 money will be available for school construction.
15. Meeting the demand for more technical education.
4. Preparing students for future military service.
These problems, Dr. Bartky declares, cannot be solved in the traditional
ways. Some probable developments in public schools will be summer
school sessions, elongated days, larger classes, double shifts, night classes,
end longer teacher hours. Dr. Bartky predicts that within three years not
more than 10 per cent of California high schools will be operating on a
normal school day.
While admitting that public education must respond to the wartime
need for technical training, Dr. Bartky warns that, in order to prevent
totalitarianism, schools must resist any pressure for technical education
at the expense of social education.
Other implications of total mobilization, he points out, are a probable
shifting of military training to the high schools and an extension of
nursery schools to release more parents for work in war industries. Some
high schools may also have to devise schedules that will release some
students for part-time work in these vital industries. As in the last war,
•ollegcs and universities will be geared largely to the military program.
