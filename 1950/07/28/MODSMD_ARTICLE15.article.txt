# Once Around The Quad
## Student Activities SUNDAY FLICK 
### 
A touch of immortality comes to
the Mem Aud's boisterous screen
Sunday night when \V. C. Fields
flashes across the screen as "The
Bank Dick." A Warner Brothers
cartoon will he shown along with
that perfectly terrible serial "Junior
G-Mcn.'
