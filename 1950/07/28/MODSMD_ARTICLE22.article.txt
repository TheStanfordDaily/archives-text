NEW YORK, July 27 (UP)—Curt
Simmons, whipping in his fast
curve for the last time before be
ginning a two - week National
Guard hitch, pitched Philadelphia
to a 13 to 3 victory over the Chi
cago Cubs today and enabled the
Phillies to keep their game-and-a
half lead over second - place St.
Louis in the National League.
Simmons allowed seven hits and
never was in trouble. The Phillies'
$60,000 bonus lefty gave up only
one earned run—Andy Pafko's 19th
homer. Right fielder Del Ennis fur
nished most of Simmons' batting
support. He batted twice with the
bases loaded and unleashed a three
run double and a grand slam homer
to drive in seven runs.
The triumph gave the Phillies a
sweep of the four-game series and
was their eighth victory in the last
10 games. It was Simmons' sixth
straight triumph. The 21-year-old
Egypt, Pa., youngster hasn't been
beaten since the Cubs whipped him,
7 to 4, on June 23.
Simmons will report to the Na
tional Guard Saturday with a 14-5
record for the season.
The Cardinals, except for Stan
Musial, found nothing but clover at
Ebbets Field. Musial went hitless
in five times at bat, ending his hit
ting streak at 30 games, while his

teammates collected • 13~ lilts ' off
starter Johnny Van Cuyk and four
other Dodger pitchers' . . .
Gene Hermanski's f<?yrfch - inning
homer and a two-rurl'homer in the
ninth by Tommy Brown gave
Brooklyn its only tallies.
After absorbing nine straight de
feats by Cleveland, the Philadelphia
Athletics came up with a 7 to 2
victory over the Indians. Lou Bris
sie, the workhorse of the Philadel
phia pitching staff, allowed only
four hits and had a shutout until
two walks and an error enabled the
Indians to rally for two runs in the
ninth.
Detroit's Paul (Dizzy) Trout, who
has been used mainly as a relief
pitcher this season, started against
the Boston Red Sox and gave up
only nine well-scattered hits to lead
the Tigers to a 5 to 1 triumph.
The Tigers got all their runs off
Ellis Kinder, two of them coming
on Vic Wertz's two-run homer in
the fifth inning. Kinder, who suf
fered his 10th loss against as many
victories, left the game in the same
inning because of a sprained side
muscle. Detroit also supported
Trout with four double plays as
they broke a six-game Boston win
ning streak.
At Chicago, the Washington Sen
ators scored three runs in the

eighth inning to beat the While
Sox, 3 to 2, in the first game of a
double - header. Billy Pierce held
Washington hitless until Irv Noren
doubled with one down in the sev
enth but in the eighth the little
lefty loaded the bases. He was re
lieved by Howie Judson after an
infield out tied the score at 1-1.
Sam Me!e then greeted Judson with
a game-winning single.
Chicago won the second game, 6
to 3. Randy Gumpert, White Sox
right-hander, had no trouble ex
cept in the third inning when the
Senators scored all their runs. He
allowed only seven hits to score his
fourth victory against five defeats.
