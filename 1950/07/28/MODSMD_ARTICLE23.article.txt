(Editor's Note: This is the fifth
of a series of photographic intro
ductions of the men who will
make up the 1950 Stanford foot
ball team. Sports Editor Al Berry
doing the honors.)
I-ULLBACK 808 GRIFFIN
and CENTER DICK ABRAHAM
will be two of the more rugged
lads on Coach Marchie Schwartz's
Gala Autumn Review.
Griffin managed to spend most
of his 1!)49 football time sitting
optimistically on the green bench
in front of the rooting section. It
wasn't that Bob wasn't good
enough, it was just that three
guys named Mitchell (now prac
ticing for the All-Star game in
Chicago), De Younrr, and Klein
were ahead of him. With the Big
three now graduated, it appears
that fullback Griffin may very
well turn out to be the best of
the lot. Or so it looked during
last spring practice.
Senior Dick Abraham, a sturdy
lad of 200 pounds and 6 feet 2
inches, is head and shoulders
above any of the rest of the Cards'
pivot post candidates. "The Bear"
is an excellent linebacker as well

as out best offensive center. With
the current Cardinal shortage in
these two departments, the old
Bear may well have to put in a
flat sixty minutes in some of the
tougher tilts. Fortunately he has
the experience and stamina to do
it, we hope.
