(UP) —"New heartbreaks, new set
backs are ahead of the United Na
tions forces in their fight against
the North Korean Communist in
vaders," Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur
said today after a flying visit to this
war zone.
"But I was never more confident
in victory—in ultimate victory—in
my life," the UN commander-in

to Tokyo.
(Mac Arthur arrived back at Ha
neda at 7:40 tonight (8:40 a.m. PDT

Walker, commanding the Eighth
Army; Maj. Gen. Earle E. Par
tridge, commanding the Fifth Air

Syngman Rhee of the Korean re

ground strength is necessary to stop
and throw out the Communists.
(A Tokyo dispatch sent after
Mac Arthur's return said he was ex

pected to report to the President
by direct two - way teletype to
Washington on his visit.)
It was Mac Arthur's second visit
to Korea since the war started June

he went to the hospital.
Mac Arthur told Rhee:
"We are going to help take care
of your country."'
