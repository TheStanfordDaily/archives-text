# American GI's Face the Enemy in Southern Korea
## 
### 

KOREA—the center of activity in the four weeks old war. This map, issued recently by Acme Newspictures,
shows the terrain and geographical centers of this pen insula which bridges the gap between Asia proper and
Japan. As of last night, the Communist troops were attacking on all fronts—their main offensive centered
just above and slightly to the west of Kunchon, on the main supply line from the American naval base at
Pusan. Four Northern divisions, estimated at over 40,000 men, have been pulling into position north of this
point for several days. In the southwest area, a mystery force of U.S. troops recaptured the town of Ilam
yang, halfway between Choniu and Pusan. No word has arrived from the southern front, where the Ameri
cans are believed to be holding their own against the scattered forces of Northern Koreans who have infil
trated their lines. Briefly then, the battle line runs west from just below Andong almost to Taejon and then
south to Yesu on the coast. *■
The Communists continued to build up their strength on the main war front despite the heaviest aerial
attacks of the war by United States Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force, and United States and British
Navy carrier planes. The aerial offensive is now in its sixth straight day.
A United Press dispatch from First Cavalry Division headquarters in Korea said that some high-ranking
generals feel it will take at least six divisions, instead of the three now there, to defeat the Communists.
A United States Navy spokesman said that American heavy cruisers would go into action soon to blast
the enemy coasts with their powerful eight-inch guns. The spokesman naturally did not name units.


GUN CREW IN ACTlON—Somewhere along the front line in
South Korea, 155-mm. ;un crew reloads for action against advanc
ing Keds. Note how surrounding trees and brush afford camouflage
for the field piece.


TANK KILLER—WeII camouflaged U.S. troops sight a 3.5-inch
rocket launcher at the battlefront in South Korea. This new and
larger Bazooka is credited with stopping many of Hie huge North
Korean tanks.
