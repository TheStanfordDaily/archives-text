LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 27
(UP) — Russia announced today
that it would return to the United
Nations Security Council next
Tuesday, raising hopes that the So
viet Union is ready to end its 29-
week boycott of the world organi
zation.
Chief Soviet Delegate Jacob A.
Malik's office telephoned Secretary
General Trygve Lie at 4:40 p.m.
EDT and said he would take the
presidency of the Security Council
in Russia's regular term beginning
August 1. He immediately called a
Council meeting for 3 p.m. Tuesday.
The big question was whether the
sudden Soviet move heralded a per
manent end to the Russian UN boy
cott or whether Malik would appear
merely to renew his fight on the
issue that provoked the first walk
out last Jan. 13. That issue was
Russia's demand that the Chinese
Nationalists be ousted — a demand
that has been renewed recently as a
Soviet price for agreement to me
diation in the Korean crisis.
