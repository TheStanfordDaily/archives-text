# Reds Attack Entire GI Line

### 
TOKYO, Friday, July 28 (UP)—
A lightning thrust by Communist
troops along the south coast of Ko
rea drove American forces back 25
miles to within 50 miles of the port
of Pusan today.
The attack was launched at dawn
in a blinding rain and under the
cover of a thunderous artillery bar
rage.
First targets of the assault were
both ends of the line held by the
U.S. First Cavalry Division and
various points along the line de
fended by the U.S. 25th Infantry
Division. The First Cavalry was
; astride the highway at Hwanggan,
eight miles northeast of Yongdong
which the Americans abandoned
' earlier this week. The 25th Infantry
; was on the First Cavalry's right
flank.
Four North Korean divisions, es
timated at 40.000 or more men, had
; been pulling into positions for the
\ big assauii opposite the American
! front for the past two days.
As the fighting flared in the cen
ter of the line a new threat was re
ported developing in the southwest,
| about 65 miles below the central
I front.

A spokesman at Fifth Air Force
headquarters in Korea disclosed
that Mustang fighters had raided
Red forces assembling at Kuyre, 90
miles west of the vital U.S. port of
entry at Pusan. Returning pilots
reported they left Kuyre in flames.
The air attack against the Com
munist buildup was in the area
where a mystery force of unidenti
fied Americans had broken up a
lightning thrust toward Pusan at
Hadong.
The assault on the First Cavalry
front, which had been quiet for
more than 24 hours, followed an
all-night attack against the 25th In
fantry positions to the northeast.
Shortly after dawn the U.S. soldiers
in this sector were holding firm
against the enemy jabs.
Against the First Cavalry, th?
Reds used the same tactics which
drove the Americans back from
Taejon and from Yongdong. They
struck first at both the right and
left flanks, United Press Corre
spondent Robert Bennyhoff re
ported from the front. Then they
tried the infiltration and encircle
mnts which they have used in the
past to get a foothold behind the
American lines.
"One American unit was nearly
encircled shortly after dawn but
was fighting fiercely to re-establish
contact with other elements of the
First Cavalry," Bennyhoff reported.
The attackers had heavy artillery
and mortar fire in support of their
drive, but BennyhofT reported that
no tanks appeared in the first stages
of the assault.
A tank concentration had been
reported north of Hamchang on the
25th Division's right flank, and
American officers believed that the
Communists were holding them in
reserve—to be thrown into the bat
tle if the Reds find a weak spot in
the U.S. defense.
