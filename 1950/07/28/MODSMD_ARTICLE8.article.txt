### CORNELIA LITTLE (Special to The Stanford Daily) 
WASHINGTON, July 27—It begins to sound more and more like a war.
The President's message to Congress and to the people indicated that we're
in for it now, and will need men and money and mobilization, not lor just
a lew months or a year, but indefinitely. In this city, which knows only too
well that we've hardly finished the job of mopping up after the last one,
'you might hear such a phrase as "The last war—remember that war we
had a few months ago?"
The lawmakers are up to their ears in mobilization and emergency
measures, and they are not too happy over this extended session in an
election year. "After all," they complain, "a guy has to do a little cam
paigning."

The time of recriminations is upon us. As military developments in
Korea make it more and more obvious that we were caught flat-footed,
the attendant chiropodists are being made scapegoats by Congress and the
press. The Republicans accuse the Administration, particularly the State
and Defense departments; the Democrats point out that the Republicans
weren't any smarter; most people presumably blame the Russians, how
ever.

The doctors have decided that Margaret Andra Russell is sane. She is
the woman who has appeared twice in the galleries of Congress to decry
war. Once was in 1941 and again, two weeks ago. dressed in a voluminous
gray shroud. She maintained loudly that she was "a phantom of the past"
come to warn that "a fraud is being perpetrated against humanity."
The Mental Health Commission added that Miss Russell had had a
"psychotic episode."
Congress didn't react to the phantom of the past; they have had enough
intramural cries of fraud. The latest and most violent is, of course, Tyd
ings' devastating attack on McCarthy's Communism charges. The Senator
from Wisconsin, however, does not seem to have been subdued. The whole
Republican contingent in the Senate is supporting McCarthy to the extent
of opposing the Democrats on this issue; but judging from the denuncia
tions of McCarthyism made by Margaret Smith of Maine and other promi
nent Republicans, what support they give is more a matter of party
loyalty than of conviction.

War hysteria here has, in general, gone no farther than hoarding. Not
even President Truman has been able to overrule the reasoning that since
we had a sugar (and nylon and rubber) shortage the last time we had a
war, we're going to have the same shortage now.
Meanwhile, Secretary of Agriculture Brannan is patiently asking Con
gress what he can do with all the extra food that legislation forces him
to buy in order to support prices. (He could probably find no better way
of pointing out the deficiencies of the present price-supported program
than these appeals to Congress.)
To be sure, plans are being made for the defense of Washington from
attacks including A-bomb ones, and one hears that the price of out-of
town real estate has soared along with that of other scarce commodities.
By out-of-town real estate we mean, of course, those places out of a
possible A-bomb's sphere of havoc.
There is now a bill prepared which would provide for special selection
of a new Congress in the unhappy event of a large portion of that body
being blown to bits. But the feeling is prevalent that this war is going
to be just like the last one, at least as far as the District is concerned.
Government employees again expect more job openings, longer hours,
perhaps moves to other cities, and most of them are more concerned with
the conduct of, say, the next War Manpower Commission than with that
of the next war.
War Scare Sidelight: The Secret Service finally decided that street
cars would no longer be allowed to stop in front of Blair House, where
the President is living during the remodeling of the White House. So the
platform was removed and the cars let their passengers off a block farther
on, for the sake of emergency security measures.


GROCER ERNEST L. MURPHY
has launched a campaign against
hoarders in Detroit. Whenever
anyone buys an over-supply, the
merchandise is packcd in one of
these hags and the purchaser has
to carry it from the store himself.
