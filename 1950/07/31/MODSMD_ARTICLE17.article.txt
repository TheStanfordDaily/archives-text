NEW YORK, July 30 (UP) —
Mangaer Eddie Sawyer of the Phil
lies insists "this isn't our year" but
maybe he should take another look
at today's results.
Sawyer figured his Phils wouldn't
be ready to maek an authentic pen
natn bid until at least 1951, but a
peek at the standings will show his
club leading the National League
by three full games after today's
double victory over Pittsburgh.
Robin Roberts limited the Pirates
to four scratch hits as Philadelphia
romped to a 10 to 0 decision in the
opener while Del Ennis' two - run
home highlighted a four - run
eighth inning in the nightcap.
The St. Louis Cardinals snapped
the New York Giants' nine-game
winning streak by scoring a 6 to 3
victory. Enos Slaughter drove in
three runs with a single, double,
and a triple as Gerry Staley held
New York to seven hits for his
10th triumph.
Rangy Don Newcombe hurled his
best game of the season in pacing
Brooklyn to a 7 to 2 victory over
the Chicago Cubs. Newcombe al
lowed only five hits, three in the
last two innings, while his team
mates collected 10 of their 12 hits
off Bob Rush in the first four in
nings.

third place by humbling Cincinnati
twice, 4 to 2 and 10 to 0. Vern
Bickford registered his 12th victoi'y

son, Luis Olmo, and Bob Elliott.

homer, two doubles, and a single.
In the AMERICAN LEAGUE, the
Red Sox salvaged the final con
test of a four-game series when
they defeated Cleveland, 5 to 3, in
the second game after the Indians
took the opener, 6 to 5, in 10 in
nings before 71,513 fans. Cleveland
had men on first and second in the
10th inning of the first game when
Larry Doby slashed a savage liner
at pitcher Joe Dobson. As he doub
led up in pain, the winning run
scored.
Detroit maintained its scant hold
