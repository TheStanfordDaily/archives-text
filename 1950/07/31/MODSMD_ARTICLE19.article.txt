Administrator of Veterans Affairs
Carl R. Gray Jr. last week issued a
ruling relative to veterans of World
War II who interrupt their educa
tion or training to re-enter active
military or naval service.
The administrator stated: '"Ques
tions have been raised concerning
the right of veterans who enter the
active military or naval service to
resume education and training af
ter the statutory cut-off dates. I
nave determined that any veteran
who has initiated his course of edu
cation and training, whose conduct
and progress in such course has
been satisfactory, and who is pre
vented by reason of re-entrance
.into active military or naval service
from resuming education or train
ing before July 25, 1951, or the date j
lour years subsequent to his dis
charge will be permitted to re
sume education or training within
a reasonable period following his
release from active service even
though such release is subsequent
to July 25, 1951."
