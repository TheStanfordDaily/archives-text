# 'Hasty Heart' Pleases Farm Audience
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
The Stanfrod Players seemed to
have a good time Wednesday night
with their free and relaxed produc
tion of John Patrick's popular war
time play, ' The Hasty Heart." But
then so did the audience, who ap
plauded through two encores and
clamored for more.
"The Hasty Heart," number three
in the Players' summer season, is
Patrick's post-war plea for a little
much-needed camaraderie between
human beings. And to him that
means friendship of the heart rath
er than friendship of the head. To
home this idea, the play
wright exhibits the emotional re
construction of a bitter and friend
less Scotch sergeant at the hands
of a nurse and five patients in a
British army hospital.
The Scot is a proud and inde
pendent cuss and the change takes

' place only after the upheaval of the
entire hospital ward. In the end the
| Scot finds out he is about to die,
j a fact his friends have known all
| along, and after a bitter struggle,
i realizes that the only values that
■ amount to a damn are the human
bonds of the hasty heart.
The play is not as deeply moving
as it must have been when present
ed to the war-heightened emotions
of 1945. The mawkishness possible
I in such a plot situation is obvious.
! But all tendencies in that direction
were roughly stamped out by the
stiff and tragic-comic characteriza
tion of Lachlen, the vigorous Scot.
The Players and director Hawes
deserve a good deal of credit for
the easy and sustained production.
Most of the cast, with the excep
tion of Lachlen, h;*d a little trouble
with their cosmopolitan accents.
When they finally decided to drop

the whole thing, no one seemed to
notice. I
Gordon White, as the Scot, gave
his portrayal a studied and careful
excellence. And the characteriza
tion fitted like a glove, for Lachlen
was nothing if not a studied and
very careful human being.
Jules Irving added a forceful
competence with his part of the
Yank. The rest of the hospital bud
dies, William Dailey, Stuart Camp
bell, John Summersette, and Ralph
Brown, provided the humorous
background without milking each
situation dry. Patricia Ingram as
Margaret, the nurse, was capable
| if a little tense at times.
The saddest deficiency of the play
was the fact that Lachlen was al
lowed to cut loose only once with
the beautiful, shrill, loud, discord
ant. and triumphant scream of his
bagpipes.

Gordon White, as the Scot, gave

The Stanfrod Players seemed to
have a good time Wednesday night
with their free and relaxed produc
tion of John Patrick's popular war
time play, ' The Hasty Heart." But
then so did the audience, who ap
plauded through two encores and
clamored for more.
"The Hasty Heart," number three
in the Players' summer season, is
Patrick's post-war plea for a little
much-needed camaraderie between
human beings. And to him that
means friendship of the heart rath
er than friendship of the head. To
home this idea, the play
wright exhibits the emotional re
construction of a bitter and friend
less Scotch sergeant at the hands
of a nurse and five patients in a
British army hospital.
The Scot is a proud and inde
pendent cuss and the change takes

' place only after the upheaval of the
entire hospital ward. In the end the
| Scot finds out he is about to die,
j a fact his friends have known all
| along, and after a bitter struggle,
i realizes that the only values that
■ amount to a damn are the human
bonds of the hasty heart.
The play is not as deeply moving
as it must have been when present
ed to the war-heightened emotions
of 1945. The mawkishness possible
I in such a plot situation is obvious.
! But all tendencies in that direction
were roughly stamped out by the
stiff and tragic-comic characteriza
tion of Lachlen, the vigorous Scot.
The Players and director Hawes
deserve a good deal of credit for
the easy and sustained production.
Most of the cast, with the excep
tion of Lachlen, h;*d a little trouble
with their cosmopolitan accents.
