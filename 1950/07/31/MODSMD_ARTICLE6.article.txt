LONDON, July 30—Prime Minis
ter Clement Attlee said today that
Communists everywhere are con
spiring to "sweep democracy and
liberty from the world" and told
Britons to prepare to defend them
selves and their freedoms.
In a blunt attack on worldwide
Communist designs, Attlee told a
Commonwealth radio audience that
Russia "talks peace but has im
mense forces under arms which cast
the shadow of fear over all other
peoples."
He said the aggression by "evil
forces" in South Korea was a con
spiracy against "the way of life of
free democracies."
Communists all over the world,
he said, are engaged in an attempt
to mold the whole world to their
pattern of tyranny." He called them
"ruthless and unscrupulous hypo
crites."
WASHINGTON—The Air Force
is handling its new program for
building to 69-group strength so as
to avoid a costly "boom and bust"
in the aircraft industx-y which would
hurt national defense, officials dis
closed today.
An estimated $4,000,000,000 worth
of planes and parts ordered from
some 200 manufacturers Saturday
will not force the industry to ex
pand so greatly that it might have
to make sharp cutbacks later.
The idea, ti was explained, is to
expand the industry just enough to
turn out all the planes needed by
the Air Force under present con
ditions on a sustained basis.
This will enable the industry to
recruit and train enough workers
to push plane production consider
ably above the present rate of about
215 a month. If the Korean fighting
did spill over into a general war,
they would form the nucleus for a
much larger expansion.
BRUSSELS. Belgium —The Bel
gian cabinet met in emergency ses
sion today to decide the fate of King
Leopold 111 whose return from ex
ile threatens Belgium with civil
war.
The meeting was summoned after
Leopold's eight-day reign of vio
lence came to a bloody climax Sun
day at Liege when three anti-Leo
pold demonstrators were shot to
death and eight other persons were
wounded.
