# American Lines Hold Firm Against Ceaseless Attacks

### 
TOKYO, Monday, July 31 (UP) — North Korean Communists
threw tanks and infantry today into the battle along the south
coast where the 24th Infantry Division is defending the approaches
to the port of Pusan.
The 24th Division, rested after the heart-breaking battle of Tae-

jon which ended in defeat 10 days
ago, threw back the first three Red
attempts to crack their line west of
Chinju, guarding the plains before
Pusan. Chinju is 55 miles west of
Pusan, where American men and
supplies are landed.
The Americans brought medium
tanks into action for the first time
on this front, Maj. Gen. John
Church announced. Church took
command of the 24th Division to
replace the missing Maj. Gen. Wil
liam F. Dean.
Sixty miles to the north of Chin
ju the U.S. First Cavalry Division
recaptured Chirye on the Kumchon
front. By taking Chirye the Yanks
eased the threat to the First Cav
alry Division's left flank and
cleared out a road block which had
been thrown up by the Communists.
As skies cleared over the battle
front, Allied fighter planes went
back into action from Chinju to the
Yongdong area, 70 miles to the
northwest.
Pilots spotted a large enemy
force, equipped with vehicles,
crossing the Hwang River east of
Kochang, which is 35 miles north
west of Chinju. At Kochang these
troops were in position to drive up
the main highway to Taegu, the
temporary South Korean capital
about 40 miles to the northeast.
Allied aircraft strafed the Reds
with i-ockets and machinegun fire,
but the pilots believed many North
Koreans reached the east bank of
the river. The Communists had to
ford the river because the Ameri
cans had demolished the bridge at
this point.
The situation along the entire
Allied line was this:
In the south the Communists, re
ported to be two divisions strong,
sought to thrust approximately 60
miles eastward to the supply port
of Pusan and also to drive north
eastward on Taegu. On the First
Cavalry - 25th Infantry fronts, the
Communists' immediate goal—in a
big drive which might start at any
time from the northwest — was
Kumchon and then Taegu. The
South Korean front, east of the
25th, was relatively quiet. The First
South Korean Division made a local
attack northwest of Hamchang, on
the right flank of the 25th. In the
Yechon sector to the east the Com
munists wedged into the Eighth
South Korean Division line. On the
east coast the South Koreans were
still on the attack just south of
Yongdok, with American - British,
navy bombardment support.

with i-ockets and machinegun fire,
but the pilots believed many North
Koreans reached the east bank of
the river. The Communists had to
ford the river because the Ameri
cans had demolished the bridge at
this point.
The situation along the entire
Allied line was this:
In the south the Communists, re
ported to be two divisions strong,
sought to thrust approximately 60
miles eastward to the supply port
of Pusan and also to drive north
eastward on Taegu. On the First
Cavalry - 25th Infantry fronts, the
Communists' immediate goal—in a
big drive which might start at any
time from the northwest — was
Kumchon and then Taegu. The
South Korean front, east of the
25th, was relatively quiet. The First
South Korean Division made a local
attack northwest of Hamchang, on
the right flank of the 25th. In the
Yechon sector to the east the Com
munists wedged into the Eighth
South Korean Division line. On the
east coast the South Koreans were
still on the attack just south of
Yongdok, with American - British,
navy bombardment support.
TOKYO, Monday, July 31 (UP) — North Korean Communists
threw tanks and infantry today into the battle along the south
coast where the 24th Infantry Division is defending the approaches
to the port of Pusan.
The 24th Division, rested after the heart-breaking battle of Tae-

jon which ended in defeat 10 days
ago, threw back the first three Red
attempts to crack their line west of
Chinju, guarding the plains before
Pusan. Chinju is 55 miles west of
Pusan, where American men and
supplies are landed.
The Americans brought medium
tanks into action for the first time
on this front, Maj. Gen. John
Church announced. Church took
command of the 24th Division to
replace the missing Maj. Gen. Wil
liam F. Dean.
Sixty miles to the north of Chin
ju the U.S. First Cavalry Division
recaptured Chirye on the Kumchon
front. By taking Chirye the Yanks
eased the threat to the First Cav
alry Division's left flank and
cleared out a road block which had
been thrown up by the Communists.
As skies cleared over the battle
front, Allied fighter planes went
back into action from Chinju to the
Yongdong area, 70 miles to the
northwest.
Pilots spotted a large enemy
force, equipped with vehicles,
crossing the Hwang River east of
Kochang, which is 35 miles north
west of Chinju. At Kochang these
troops were in position to drive up
the main highway to Taegu, the
temporary South Korean capital
about 40 miles to the northeast.
Allied aircraft strafed the Reds
with i-ockets and machinegun fire,
but the pilots believed many North
Koreans reached the east bank of
the river. The Communists had to
ford the river because the Ameri
cans had demolished the bridge at
this point.
