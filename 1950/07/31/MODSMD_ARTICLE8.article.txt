You can't beat the system. The government red tape and ob
stinacy is nowhere more pronounced than in the various recruit
ing oftices in the Bay Area.
As it stands now, with the draft closing down on college stu
dents who have no previous military experience, the Army is
making it as difficult as possible for students to enlist. Not only
is it impossible to get information on various enlistments, but also,
with typical Army confusion, one recruiting office doesn't know
what the other is doing, and the recruiting sergeants have no idea
of the various possibilities and opportunities offered by the Army.
All they want to do is to get you to enlist in their favorite branch,
and that branch only. As far as they are concerned, there is noth
ing else available.
For example, the Army recruiting sergeant in San Jose said
that there was no way to get into OCS unless you enlisted in the
Regulor Army and then applied. The Army recruiting officer at
the Federal Office Building in San Francisco said nothing more,
but he did suggest a trip to their office at 428 Market Street. There,
we found the recruiting office for the OCS, learned that the Armv
badly needed officers, and within a few minutes obtained all the
information and application blanks for officers' training.
What about the Army Band? Not a single recruiting officer
knew any way to get into the Army Band except by enlisting and
requesting assignment. Yesterday we had a chance to see the
magazine of the local Musicians' Union which said that there were
openings in the Presidio Army Band and that auditions were being
held every Friday.
Another inconsistency—not a single service will take a married
man for a straight enlistment, yet married men every day are be
ing called up by the reserves and special services for immediate
active duty. Furthermore, if you get married after a certain date,
you may qet drafted but you can't enlist.
Snafusion is the only way to describe this situation. We as
sume that the Army wants and needs men — not only raw re
cruits f<->r the infantry but specialists, officers, and men with dif
ferent and varied training. Why, then, does the Army make it so
difficult to get into one of these specialized services? Why don't
they tell their recruiting sergeants about OCS, the Army Band,
the Medical Corps, and other different branches? If the Army
wants men, they at least have to tell the public what is available
for them in the various branches of the service. Instead, they
leave it up to chance—the remote possibility that a man with offi
cer's qualifications will stumble upon the OCS recruiting office at
428 Market Street.
The vhole problem could be easily solved by a little book en
titled "Opportunities in the Armed Forces."
With such a book, anybody who desired to enlist would know
in a moment just what services were available to him, how long
were the various periods of enlistment, and other pertinent infor
mation
Under the present situation, a prospective Army man is turned
away from the recruiting office with the feeling that he is far better
off waiting to get drafted than if he were to enlist—according to
the recruiting officers the opportunities are the same and the
draftees' tour of duty is only 21 months instead of a three- or four
year enlistment.
If a man knew that he would get a better deal by enlisting than
by waiting to get drafted, voluntary enlistments would rise, lead
ing to a more efficient armed force and happier soldiers in the
service of their choice.
