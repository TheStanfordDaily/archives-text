## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y.. Aug. 1 (UP)—Russia, ending a 29-week
boycott of the United Nations, took another licking today in its
effort to oust Nationalist China from the world organization.
The Russians, however, this time accepted the rebuff without
departing, as they did last January, and immediately opened a
♦diplomatic offensive against the Ko-

rean crisis.
Soviet Delegate Jacob A. Malik,
taking over the Security Council
presidency for August, made anoth
er vain attempt to expel the "Kuo
mintang" delegate. He was voted
down. Then, he asked the Council
to adopt an order of business that
would bring discussion of a peace
settlement in Korea.
Malik, defeated 8-3 on his ruling
that "Kuomintang" Delegate Dr.
Tingfu F. Tsiang must leave, brand
ed the action "illegal" and mad'e
clear that he would stay on to fight
the issue from inside the UN, for
at least the month of his presi
dency.
But his attempt to push through
the Kremlin - proposed order of
business ran up against a Western

roadblock carefully constructed at
yesterday's final session before the
Soviet return.
American Delegate Warren R.
Austin insisted that priority be
given to the U.S. proposal calling'
on the Council to condemn the
North Koreans for defiance of the
cease-fire decree and to urge all
UN members to localize the Korean
conflict.
Malik then launched into a half
hour denunciation of the United
States, charging that it was trying
to block a peaceful settlement ir>
Korea and to extend its "aggres
sion" against North Korea. By the
time his speech had been translated
into English it was 6:15, and the
Council adjourned until tomorrow
at 3 p.m. without waiting for the
French translation and without
having been able even to adopt its
agenda.
Crowds of anxious delegates, of
ficials, spectators, and newsmen
filled the plush and paneled Secu
rity Council chamber to overflow
ing to see what Russia had on its
mind in the midst of the most dan
gerous East-West crisis since the
end of World War 11.
It was one of the most momentous
meetings in t lit? history of any
world organization, for many be
lieved it would provide the tip-off
on whether the world is to be
plunged soon into World War 111.
Confronted with Austin's insist
ence on priority for the U.S. reso
lution against the Red Koreans,
Malik opened up with a long speech
branding the United States an ag
gressor in Korea.
