Every time a fire alarm is called or rung in, 18 men, of whom
12 are student volunteers, risk their lives to reach the scene of
{he fire in the shortest possible time.
Fire trucks are heavy, unwieldy, and dangerous to drive. Al
most every fire house has its roll of honor—men who were killed
on the way to a fire.
Therefore, every time a prankster turns in a false alarm, he is
endangering the life of every fireman in the fire house.
Monday night, there was a false alarm at Lagunita. The exact
cause of the alarm is unknown, but every year at Stanford, there
are countless false alarms rung in from every corner of campus.
If the Farm residents won't stop this unnecessary and danger
ous game themselves, the firemen could cut down the number of
useless runs very guickly.
.Boston and seveal other big cities in the United States have
a good system. They spread an indelible red dye on the handles
of the fire boxes. Whenever anybody turns in an alarm, the dye
sticks to his fingers and cannot be washed off. It usually takes
two or three days for the dye to wear off. Since the culprit usually
sticks around to see the arriving engines, he is often spotted, un
wittingly carrying the dye on his fingers.
Such a system would work very well at Stanford. With this
close-knit community, a person with this dye on his hands would
be spotted quickly. If he had turned in a real alarm, he would be
a hero; if he turned in a false alarm, he would be immediately ap
prehended. Within a very short time, the false alarms at Stanford
would be reduced to a minimum and the Stanford firemen would
lead safer and quieter lives.
