# East German Russians Revise Schooling to Teach Hate
## 
### 
FRANKFURT, Germany (UP) —Documents smuggled out of Russian
occupied East Germany show how Communism is using the schoolroom
to instill a hatred of the United States in satellite peoples.
The documents showed that everything touching education is being
Sovietized—the teachers, the textbooks, the school songs, the secretarial
activities—from the kindergarten through the univerisities.
Education, "people's democracy" style, is conducted in a little school
house that is '"red" in every sense of the word.
In virtually every text and every recommended classroom procedure,
Western "capitalistic imperialism" emerges as the villain of the piece and
Russia as the hero and people's friend.
For example, there is a typical lesson in economics, drawn from Karl
Eduard von Schnitzler's text, "Vier Wochen Politik" (Four Weeks Poli
cies).
Here's his comparison of East and West Germany:
"East—Reconstruction based on local efforts, with the objectives of
unity and peace, based on friendship with the Soviet Union and the peo
ple's democracies.
"West—Dependence on the Marshall Plan, which means indebtedness,
colonization, unemployment, and war preparations."
Or a well-conducted eighth-grade chemistry class at Schoenbeck as
described in the official Soviet-zone teachers' publication, "Neue Schule"
(New School), of June 8. 1950:
The teacher has just completed an experiment demonstrating how coke
is made from hard coal. The recorded classroom conversation goes like
his:
Teacher: "A special reason prevents use of Zwickau (East German)
hard coal in the steel-making process. Look here. (He crumbles the coke
in his fingers.) Our coal is very soft.
"Imagine a 30-meter blast furnace with iron ore on top of the coke.
3ur soft coke can't take it. Without the hard coal of the Ruhr and the
Saar (West Germany) our economy cannot grow. Now you know why we
must fight again and again to have the Ruhr and Saar preserved for tis —
why we cannot let foreign capitalists steal our coal and steel. What do
we do?"
Pupil: "We in the German democratic republic should speak to the
people in the Western zones."
Teacher: "You think so. Everyone with relatives there should do that.
What else?"
Second Pupil: "We should talk to other countries—with the Soviet
LJnion —that they should help us."
Teacher: "Now you get it. We must keep close friendship with the
Soviet Union and the people's democracies. We must fight for German
unity, so that foreign capitalists in the West do not steal our coal any more.
How simple it all would be if we had the Ruhr and Saar at our disposal.
Think now we could live today if there were no zonal borders."
Then there is Prof. A. Mischulin's required. Communist-style "Ancient
History." It is written in Russian, of course, since every East German
ihild above the fifth grade must study that language.
Here's a chapter titled "How the slavekeeper states came into being.'"
"It has been proved by science," the professor writes, "that Christ
never existed."
He explains at length that the "myth of Christ" was a clever device
used by the wealthy to exploit the workers by holding up the example
of "a Jesus Christ, supposed to be divine, who taught that one must bear
all manner of ills patiently because those who suffered and were oppressed
would be rewarded after death."
