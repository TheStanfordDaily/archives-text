SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES—Coach Jim Lawson, quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee,
guard Bruno Bailducci, and Coach Chuck Taylor line up and look pretty for the Daily photog on the
Menlo practice field, where the San Francisco '49c rs are now holding their pro-season exertions. All
five men were vital cogs of Stanford's HMO Kosebowl champions. Lawson was an assistant coach, Albert
was quarterback, Standlee was fullback, Banducci one of the tackles, and Taylor one of the starting guards
in teh pre-war days of "our year." The smiles on the faces of the players arc of confidence; Coaches
Lawsun and Taylor are evidently thinking of the Philadelphia Eagle and Chicago Bear forward walls.
Standlec, the little guv in the middle, yesterday was voted '49er team captain for the third straight
year. Taylor is spending his first year as line coach for the pro boys, after putting in three successful
(i.e., undefeated) seasons as headman of the Stanford frosh.
