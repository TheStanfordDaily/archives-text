PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 1 (UP) —
! Curt Simmons, ace Hurler of the
league - leadiing Philadelphia Phil
■ lies, was called to active duty with
the 28th National Guard Division
today, but the brilliant southpaw
was expected to go against the Cin
cinnati Reds tonight in the second
game of a twi-night doubleheader.
A club spokesman said Simmons
was expected to reach Shibe Park
on a special overnight military pass
I in time to take the mound for the
' second game.
There also was the chance that
j Simmons may be able to perform
' for the Phillies in a few games dur
-1 ing the next three or four weeks
before he dons the Army khaki for
good.
Gov. James H. Duff announced
that the famed Bloody Buckct Di
vision will cut short its annual two
weeks maneuvers at Indiantown
; Gap, Pa.. Sunday and that the

Guardsmen will be sent to their
home station the following day, Au
gust 8. Simmons is now in camp.
That means that the big, 21-year
old southpaw, who tops the Phils'
mound staff this season with 14 vic
tories, will be with the team until
his division leaves for Camp Atter
bury, Ind., on or about September 1.
The loss of the $65,000 bonus

will affect the team's pennant
chances unless they can get an ade
quate replacement.
