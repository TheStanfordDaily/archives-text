# Senate Approves Franco Spain $100,000,000 Anti-Red Loan

WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 (UP)â€”The Senate voted 65 to 15 today
to lend Spain 5100,000,000 after Democratic leaders withdrew their
objections in the face of appeals that Generalissimo Francisco
Franco's aid is vital to the fight against Communism.
If the House agrees, the move may force a major shift in United

States policy toward Spain.

State Department officials were
greatly surprised by the Senate's
action, but declined to comment
pending clarification of the exact
nature of the loan proviso.
The Senate agreed to the Spanish
loan after taking steps to make sure
the money is not taken out of the
$2,726,000,000 approved yesterday
for a third-year installment of the
Marshall Plan.
Sen. Pat McCarran, D.. Nev., had
proposed that $100,000,000 of the aid
money be lent to Spain. But he ac
cepted a substitute proposal by four
Democratic Senators authorizing
the Economic Co-operation Admin
istration to borrow the money from
the Treasury without affecting the
ECA's own funds.
