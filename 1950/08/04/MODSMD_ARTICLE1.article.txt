YANKS COUNTER-ATTACKâ€”Reinforced 24th Division units on the
Chinju-Masan-Pusan front (1) launched a double-harreled counter
attack. One unit captured high ground northeast of Chinju, but the
other hogged down in the face of Red flanking tactics. First Cavalry
troops withdrew from Kumchon (2) to new defense positions to the
east. Other First Cavalry units are threatened with encirclement by
a two-pronged Communist attack in the Hyopchor sector (:{). Red
invaders ease attack in the Yechon area on the north front (4), and
both sides are fighting furiously for Yongdok on the east coast (5).
