## Wartime Adjustments 
### 
What's going to happen in Korea is anybody's guess. We can
only sit and await the outcome of this one, localized incident that
has already started the United States on the road to full-scale mo
bilization and war-time controls.
But, while the entire United States is being switched over to
war-time programs, Stanford also will quickly be faced with a
multitude of problems based directly on the war situation—prob
lems that will have to be solved quickly, maybe before the start ;
of the coming quarter. For instance:
Housing. Yesterday's announcement that the Army is planning
to raise its ranks to one million men will certainly be shown in
the Stanford enrollment. Will this mean a larger enrollment of
women to compensate for the drain of men to the armed services,
and, if so, where will the women be housed? At the moment, the 1
Housing Office is having trouble accommodating the co-ed en
rollment for this fall in the existing women's housing. And what
about married women? With their husbands off to war, a lot of
maried girls will want to return to college. As it stands now, mar- J
ried women cannot live in University dormitories. Will this rule
be changed? Probably the University will set aside one Row
house for married women. And the problem of the fraternities—
during the last war, the fraternities were suspended and the fra
ternity houses were turned over to men students under University
supervision.
Curriculum. Undoubtedly, members of the reserve now en-1
rolled will be forced to withdraw either in the middle of a quarter
or when they are within a quarter of graduation. Will any pro- j
visions be made to credit their records with the semi-completed
work or give them premature diplomas on the basis of time in the
armed forces? Will the general program be changed—that is, will
more emphasis be given to military and technical subjects?
The problems are many and varied; many gray hairs will be
shed by the administration before they are solved. The casualty
lists from Korea give this "incident" in Korea the reality of total
war. The country is arming and preparing itself for full-scale
mobilization and the University community will have to fall in
step, and do so quickly.
