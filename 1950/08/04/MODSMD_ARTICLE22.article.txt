# Tigers Dump Yanks 5 to 2; Sweep Three-Game Series
## 
### 
Detroits raging Bengal Tigers made it three in a row over the
once second-place New York Yankees yesterday, as they thumped
the bombless Bombers 5 to 2 before nearly 40,000 fully satisfied
Motor City fans.
Tiger Art Houtteman, who was supposed to have a sore muscle

in his side, was the man-on-the
mound of the day as he allowed a
very respectable Yank batting or
der to collect but six evenly spaced
hits; and if it hadn't been for a
small sticker named Johnny Mize,
who plavs a bit of first sack for the
Now Yorkers, the big Bengal might
have had a shut-out.
The Tigers collected a first-inning
lead of four runs off of the not too
brilliant pitching of chucker Eddie
Lopat. who was soon replaced by
Yankee Fred Sanford. Sanford
managed to keep the prowling Ti
gers off of the base pads until he
was replaced by reliefer Joe Page
in the seventh.
The Bengals' safety run came in
the bottom of the eighth stanza
when American League batting
champion George Kell tagged a
clean single with a teammate on
third base.
It was the third time in as many
days that the loop-leading Tigers
had trampled on the visiting Yanks,
and it was a defeat that dropped the
New Yorkers into third place—a
half-game beind Cleveland and a
fairly comfortable four and a half
games above Boston's Red Sox.
Previously the Tigers had beaten
the Yanks in this series 7-3 and 4-0,
Wednesday's shut-out coming from
the paws of Detroit's diminutive
Hal White.
The line score:
New York .... 000 200 000—2 fi 1
Detroit 400 000 Olx—s 5 0
Lopat. Sanford (1), Page (7) and
Berra; Houtteman and Swift.
