# Stanford Scientists Utilize Electronics to Measure Winds of Ionosphere Eighty Miles Above the Earth
## 
### 
An electronic method for meas
uring winds 55 to 80 miles above
'he earth was disclosed yesterday
by a team of Stanford University
.scientists.
Their report, published in the
August Proceedings of the Institute
of Radio Engineers, described a ra
dio technique of analyzing the drift
of meteor trails to measure wind
speeds and directions in the iono
sphere at altitudes twice as high as
can be reached by sounding bal
' oons.
The scientists, L. A. Manning, O.
G. Villard Jr., and A. M. Peterson.
of the University's Electronics
Research Laboratory, utilized the
electrical disturbances created by
-he passage of meteors through the
outer atmosphere to make their
measurements.
The research, financed by the Of
fice of Naval Research and ex
pected to have useful applications
,n the design fo long-range guided
nissiles and in weather forecasting,
is based on the fact that the elec
trical disturbances caused by the
heat of a meteor's passage are effi
cient reflectors of radio waves and
may be detected by a radar-like
eehnique.
Sach disturbance lasts only a
second or two but during that time
drifts like a smoke puff under the
influence of winds in the outer at
mosphere.
To measure the speed and direc
tion of these winds, the Stanford
scientists devised a special appara
tus —an "electronic anemometer"—
vvhich determines the rate of drift
in 1 the direction of each disturb
ance.
An anemometer is an instrument
used by weather bureaus for wind
letermination.
By averaging many measure
ments, the scientists are able to de
termine the average motion of the
air mass between 55 and 80 miles
high.
This motion is found to be at a
speed which varies from day to day,
from as low as 30 to as high as 125
miles an hour.
In addition to this average mo
tion, the scientists reported evi
dence of irregularity in the nature
of the wind.
The meteoric "smoke puffs" are
usually observed to drift at speeds
of 200 miles an hour, even though
the air mass as a whole is moving
several times more slowly. It is not
yet clear, the research team re
ported, whether these irregularities
are the result of local turbulences
or of separate layer - like winds
blowing in different directions at
different altitudes.
The measurements indicated that
during July and August last year,
the winds in the outer atmosphere
were predominantly from the
south-southwest, with some winds
from the north, and a few weaker
winds blowing west to east.
In order to obtain a measurement
of this sort with accuracy, several
hundred meteor echoes are re
quired.
The bright flashes seen in the
night sky by the naked eye are
caused by particles of matter about
the size of a small pea. Smaller
particles, producing weaker flashes
not visible to the human eye but
easily spotted by electronic meth
ods, are far more numerous. In fact
the earth's outer atmosphere is lit
erally peppered night and day by
tiny specks of meteoric dust.

Radio equipment can detect these
tiny meteors both by day and by
night, so the "electrical smoke puff"
method of wind measurement is
potentially capable oi giving con
tinuous wind readings.
Thus far the Stanford workers
have made measurements only dur
ing the early morning hours when
radio conditions are best. With im
proved equipment which is just be
ing put into service in the Stanford
research, they expect to be able to
extend the measurements around
the clock.
By a further extension of the
technique, the scientists believe, it
should be possible to measure
winds at selected heights in the
55- to 80-mile altitude range.
The meteor drift method is the
first to otter the possibility of con
tinuously measuring winds at dif-
ferent altitudes. Other radio wind-
measuring methods have recently
been devised in the United States
and England, but they depend on
the regular ionosphere layers and
so are restricted to specific heights.
Wind measurements made during
high altitude rocket flights are ex
pensive and restricted to a few
minutes' duration.
The Stanford scientists pointed
out that knowledge of the high al
titude winds gives information as
to the composition of the upper air.
This information is of value to high
altitude aircraft designers in con
nection with airfoil design. And it
is particularly useful to weather
forecasters because weather predic-
tions must be based on the most
complete possible knowledge of the
atmosphere — from the ground to
the greatest height which can be
measured.
The meteor method makes pos
sible measurements at heights
where methods previously used in
weather forecasting are impractical.
During the development of the
technique described in the Pro
ceedings of the Institute of Radio
Engineers, the Stanford scientists
made experiments in the field to
verify results obtained in research
on the University campus.
One such test was made at the
Edenvale estate of E. L. Hayes.
Stanford alumnus and publisher of
the San Jose Mercury Herald. A
complete meteor - detecting and
drift-measuring apparatus was set
up at Edenvale and other apparatus
was operated from a mobile truck
at Coyote.
Another group of experiments

was carried out on two other occa
sions at the Patterson Airport at
Patterson. Calif., through the kind
ness of Wayland G. Fink, the own
er.


PROFESSOR L. A. MANNING
of the Stanford Electrical Engi
neering Department examines a
paper tape recording of the drift
of meteoric "smoke puffs" detect
ed by radio equipment. The drift
gives clues to the speed and di
rection of upper atmosphere
winds.
