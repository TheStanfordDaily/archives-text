# Council Defeats Three Russ Proposals As Malik Attacks U.S. Policy in Korea
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Aug. 3 (UP) —Russia suffered three major
diplomatic defeats in the United Nations Security Council today
after warning that the UN must choose between peace and war.
Shortly after Soviet Delegate Jacob A. Malik issued that blunt
warning, the Council:

1. Refused to place the seating of
Communist China ahead of the Ko
rean peace problem on the Council's
agenda.
2. Refused to place the Chinese
issue on the agenda at all at this
time.
3. Refused to accept a Russian
agenda item entitled "Peaceful Set
tlement of the Korean Question."
Malik declared that there were
two courses open to the UN. "One
leads to peace," he said. "The other
to war." He demanded also that the
UN cancel its support of what he
termed American "aggression in
Korea."
In refusing to place the question
of who is to represent China in the
UN ahead of the Korean problem,
the Council decided to place first on
its agenda an American proposal
calling for localization of the Ko
rean conflict.
The American resolution, offered
before Malik ended a 29-week boy
cott and returned to the Council as
its chairman on Tuesday, also con
demns the Communist North Ko
reans for defying the UN's cease
fire, and withdrawal decree.
Russia's three defeats came in
votes of 8 to 1, 5 to 5, and 8 to 3.
Seven affirmative votes are re
quired for passage.
The votes actually constituted a
reply by the Council majority that
it would not be cowed by Soviet
threats on Korea and that it would
push firmly ahead with its cam
paign to repel the Red North Ko
rean invaders.
American Delegate Warren R.
Austin, flushed with anger by Ma
lik's vitriolic attack on the United
States, keynoted the Western an
swer. He denounced Russia for its
"shameless travesties of realities" at
a time "when men are dying on the
battlefield of Korea."
The big three Western powers
who spearheaded the drumfire de
feat of Russia on all three votes had
argued that:
1. The question of Chinese repre

sentation has nothing to do with the
prime question of dealing with ag
gression launched by the North Ko
reans June 25.
2. Russia can trot out any peace
proposals it wants on Korea under
the original title "Complaint of Ag
gression Against the Republic or
Korea." In fact, the United States,
Britain, and France all challenged
the Kremlin at yesterday's meet
ings to put up any genuine propo
sals it had in mind.
Today's Council meeting pro
duced the most violent anti-Ameri
can charges since the return of the
Russians to the UN, and the an
griest American reply. It was the
fourth Council meeting of the
week, and a fifth was scheduled for
tomorrow to begin debate on the
American resolution calling on UN
members to refrain from any act
that might spread the Korean con
flict.
Malik opened the day's proceed
ings with a lengthy attack on U.S.
"aggression" in Korea. He reached
his high point when he said:
"The UN has two alternative
courses. One leads to peace; the
other to war.' And he went on to
spell out what he meant by charg
ing that it was U.S. meddling in
what he termed Korea's "civil war"
that was bringing on World War
111. Russia, on the. other hand, was
pointing out the way to peace, he
said, by calling for peace talks. But
he was quick to tack on the usual
Soviet price tag for Security Coun
cil negotiation — admission of the
Chinese Communists.
And the vote today gave the
Kremlin another flat "no" on that
proposition.
In replying to Malik, Austin
flailed the Soviet chairman for us
ing his office to make an "out of
order" speech at a time when '"sons
of members of this organization are
over there under flags of their own
nationalities and . . . are fighting
also under the blue and white ban
ner of the UN."
Austin added:
"We are tired and I think the
world is tired of these obvious ani
shameless travesties of the realities
with which we in this room are sup
posed to be dealing. Surely, the
time for that sort of thing has
passed, and the matters we are
dealing with today are too tragic
and too real to be served by any
preoccupation with propagandists
distortions which were properly re
ferred to yesterday as 'upside-down,
language'."
