WASHINGTONâ€”The House ten
tatively approved a sweeping eco
nomic mobilization bill today under
which wage-price ceilings would go
into effect automatically if the liv
ing costs rise five per cent above
pre-Korean war levels.
It would provide the standby ra
tioning powers and controls over
credit and industrial materials
which Mr. Truman sought, but its
formula for automatic wage - price
ceilings was a far cry from the pro
posal originally drafted by the ad
ministration.
