## Editorial Adjustment 
### 
Jim Thurber, the editor of The Stanford Daily, has the somewhat
confusing distinction of being in love and draftable at the same
Ume. T t is because of the incompatibility of these two elements
that another name—mine —appears on the masthead of today's
Daily.
Thurber has been engaged to a very charming young lady in
Chicago for some time now, and their marriage—the inevitable
result of engagements, we're told—was scheduled for the middle
of September. Jim's draft board, San Jose division, has informed
him that all bright youngsters of the ripe old age of 22 would be
called into active participation in world military affairs very soon,
and went on to say that he would, in all probability, be on active
duty by the middle of September.
Since this probability would conflict somewhat with his mar
riage plans, Editor Thurber left Friday night via United Airlines
for a small suburb outside of Chicago. He and Miss Emily Forrest
will be married there tomorrow.
It is not expected that the wedding will alter Jim's draft status
at all. The main purpose for it is that two nice people want to get
married. Which is, of course, entirely their business.
Thurber expects to return later in the quarter in time to take
active command of the last few issues of The Daily this summer.
Until then, if we have an editorial policy (other than getting to the
.students the best available world and campus news that space and
time considerations allow), it will not be changed.
And so in this, our first editorial under an acting editor, The
Stanford Daily comes out strongly in favor of marriage, love, and
The Stanford Daily. —A. B.
