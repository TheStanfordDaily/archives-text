# Final Rehearsals of Rain Started by Farm Cast
## 
### 
"Joseph Hornswaggle, dealer in
elephant tusks, coconut husks, and
women of ill repute."
This was the sign over Trader
Horn's store that greeted the cast
when the "Rain" set went up Sat
urday night. It seems the stage
crew had their own idea of what
the play was about. As soon as
Joe Horn's Pago Pago general store
was relegated to its proper place,
the Stanford Players began to put
the finishing touches on their final
play of the summer season, "Rain,"
by John Colton and Clement Ran
dolph. adapted from the W. Somer
set Maugham short story "Miss
Thompson."
While this play has been widely
discussed and was, at the time of its
original production, the center of a
storm of controversy and criticism,
it remains a sincere and serious
study of the dangers to be found in
any extremist philosophy of lifeâ€”
whether that of the pagan or of the
orthodox Christian.
The authors of "Rain" have pro
vided a trenchant and unforgettable
indictment of fanaticism in the
story of the prostitute who, unable
to cope with the struggles of com
plex society state - side, removes
herself to the pagan islands of the
South Pacific. It is one of the ironic
tragedies that even in the moment
of her flight she is intercepted by
the Reverend Davidson, whose
honest and direct pleas convert her
to a way of thinking which provides
the security lacking in her former
philosophy.
The tragedy of the drama, how

ever, is not that of the prostitute,
Sadie, but that of the Reverend Da
vidson, for in the moment of his
spiritual conversion of Sadie he
succumbs to physical temptation.
Afraid to face the consequences of
his own weakness, he then kills
himself, thus becoming a martyr
and thereby condemning the help
less prostitute.
The action of "Rain" takes place
in the port of Pago Pago on the is
land of Samoa. The setting of the
lobby of Trader Horn's hotel and
general store has been designed by
John Stevens. Costumes recreating
the styles of the early 1920's have
been designed by Esther Klein.
"Rain" is being directed by A.
Nicholas Vardac.
Tickets for most performances of
"Rain," the last play of the Stanford
Players' summer season, are still
available at the box office in Me
morial Hall, which is open from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, telephone DA
