SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 6 (UP) |
—Longshore leader Harry Bridges,
denounced as a "traitorous" Com
munist agent, was confined in a
cell at the county jail here today as s
his attorneys planned new moves to
gain his freedom.
The hawk-nosed boss of the West i
Coast's dock workers was visited by |
his wife Nancy. He also conferred
with his attorney James Maclnnis,
who plans to appeal to the Ninth
U.S Circuit Court of Appeals to
morrow, asking Bridges' immediate :
release on bail or on a writ of ha
beas corpus pending a hearing on !
the bail question.
Bridges passed a restful night in !
his cell, jail attendants said, adding,
"After all, he used to be a seaman
ar.d he's slept in a lot worse places
than this."
Yesterday, he was taken to the
jail after Federal District Judge
George B. Harris revoked the $25,-
000 bail granted him four months
ago pending his appeal of his con
viction of perjury - conspiracy in
concealing his Communist party
membership at his 1945 naturaliza
tion hearing. He was given a five
year sentence at that time.
In his decision yesterday, Harris

delivered a scathing denunciation
of the 49-year-old Australian-born
Bridges. He termed him "one of the
most potent figures in the Commu
nist party in. America today," and

j ordered him jailed as a menace to
America's internal security.
Harris said Bridges' stand on the
i Korean war followed the Commu
nist party line and said. "This is no
time for divided loyalty."
"A mantle of protection over the
conduct of Harry Bridges would be
a travesty and mockery of our in
stitutions," Harris said.
Bridges, his wife, and their two
daughters sat quietly through the
bitter denunciation, and as he was
led away he said to her, "No tears
now.'
Bridges told reporters that the
ruling was not unexpected.
"I believe right now that anyone
who speaks his personal views on
I this subject (the Korean war) is in
danger." lie said.
Harris' decision came as the cli
max of a four-day hearing during
which Bridges insisted his actions
were motivated only by patriotism
and his opposition to war.
The government contended his
action, in opposing all-out support
of the United States and United
Nations intervention in Korea by
his longshore union, was motivated
by his following the Communist,
party line.

year sentence at that time.
In his decision yesterday, Harris

delivered a scathing denunciation
of the 49-year-old Australian-born
Bridges. He termed him "one of the
most potent figures in the Commu
nist party in. America today," and

j ordered him jailed as a menace to
America's internal security.
Harris said Bridges' stand on the
i Korean war followed the Commu
nist party line and said. "This is no
time for divided loyalty."
"A mantle of protection over the
conduct of Harry Bridges would be
a travesty and mockery of our in
stitutions," Harris said.
Bridges, his wife, and their two

Bridges told reporters that the
ruling was not unexpected.
"I believe right now that anyone

Harris' decision came as the cli

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 6 (UP) |
—Longshore leader Harry Bridges,
denounced as a "traitorous" Com
munist agent, was confined in a
cell at the county jail here today as s
his attorneys planned new moves to
gain his freedom.
The hawk-nosed boss of the West i
Coast's dock workers was visited by |
his wife Nancy. He also conferred
with his attorney James Maclnnis,
who plans to appeal to the Ninth
U.S Circuit Court of Appeals to
morrow, asking Bridges' immediate :
release on bail or on a writ of ha
beas corpus pending a hearing on !
the bail question.
Bridges passed a restful night in !
his cell, jail attendants said, adding,
"After all, he used to be a seaman
ar.d he's slept in a lot worse places
than this."
Yesterday, he was taken to the
jail after Federal District Judge
George B. Harris revoked the $25,-
000 bail granted him four months
ago pending his appeal of his con
viction of perjury - conspiracy in
concealing his Communist party
membership at his 1945 naturaliza
tion hearing. He was given a five
year sentence at that time.
