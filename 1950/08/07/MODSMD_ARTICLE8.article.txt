# Yanks Open First Major Offensive of Korean War
## Marine First Division Sees Initial Action on Date of 'Canal Landing 
### 
TOKYO, Monday, Aug. 7 (UP) —U.S. marines and infantrymen
opened the first major American offensive of the war today
against three Communist divisions at the southern end cf the
Allied front.
The marines from the First Division went into action for the

'first time since their landing in Ko
rea. It was the eighth anniversary
of their landing on Guadalcanal.
United Press correspondent Jack
James reported the American at
tack, which would involve as many
as 15,000 U.S. troops if all units
which went into action were at full
strength.
The troops thrown into the fight
ing on the southern front were at
about division strength. A division
normally consists of three regi
ments, and the force in today's ac
tion included two regimental teams,
which are larger than a normal reg
iment, plus a reinforced regiment.
The U.S. counterattack started at
6:30 a.m. on the front west of the
Masan - Chindong area. The U.S.
fighting men, seeking to stop the
Communist drive on the vital port
of Pusan, were members of the
Fifth regimental combat teams and
a reinforced regiment of the Third
Marine Brigade of the First Marine
Division.
The thunder of U.S. artillery and
bombs from American planes pre
ceded the big U.S. drive, which may
prove to be the turning point in the
war.
In addition to halting the push
aaginst Pusan, the American coun
teroffensive was designed to relieve
the mounting pressure against Al
lied troops to the north.
The entire force was under the
command of Maj. Gen. William E.
Kean, commander of the Army's
25th Division.
To the north, the Communists
still held the offensive. They pushed
new spearheads across the Naktong
River defense line in at least three
places 15 to 20 miles southwest of
Taegu. the provisional South Ko
rean capital.
The North Koreans also rein
forced a bridgehead of more than
1,000 troops which they had put
across the Naktong earlier. Ameri
can troops of the 24th Division had
this Communist force boxed in at a,
bend in the river and were trying
to mop up the North Koreans be
fore they could infiltrate the Amer
ican lines in force.
In the early stages of this fight
ing the Americans hurled the Com
munists back to three hills on the
east side of the river.

TOKYO, Monday, Aug. 7 (UP) —U.S. marines and infantrymen
opened the first major American offensive of the war today
against three Communist divisions at the southern end cf the
Allied front.
The marines from the First Division went into action for the

'first time since their landing in Ko
rea. It was the eighth anniversary
of their landing on Guadalcanal.
United Press correspondent Jack
James reported the American at
tack, which would involve as many
as 15,000 U.S. troops if all units
which went into action were at full
strength.
The troops thrown into the fight
ing on the southern front were at
about division strength. A division
normally consists of three regi
ments, and the force in today's ac
tion included two regimental teams,
which are larger than a normal reg
iment, plus a reinforced regiment.
The U.S. counterattack started at
6:30 a.m. on the front west of the
Masan - Chindong area. The U.S.
fighting men, seeking to stop the
Communist drive on the vital port
of Pusan, were members of the
Fifth regimental combat teams and
a reinforced regiment of the Third
Marine Brigade of the First Marine
Division.
The thunder of U.S. artillery and
bombs from American planes pre
ceded the big U.S. drive, which may
prove to be the turning point in the
war.
In addition to halting the push
aaginst Pusan, the American coun
teroffensive was designed to relieve
the mounting pressure against Al
lied troops to the north.
The entire force was under the
command of Maj. Gen. William E.
Kean, commander of the Army's
25th Division.
To the north, the Communists
still held the offensive. They pushed
new spearheads across the Naktong
River defense line in at least three
places 15 to 20 miles southwest of
Taegu. the provisional South Ko
rean capital.
The North Koreans also rein
forced a bridgehead of more than
1,000 troops which they had put
across the Naktong earlier. Ameri
can troops of the 24th Division had
this Communist force boxed in at a,
bend in the river and were trying
to mop up the North Koreans be
fore they could infiltrate the Amer
ican lines in force.
In the early stages of this fight
ing the Americans hurled the Com
munists back to three hills on the
east side of the river.
