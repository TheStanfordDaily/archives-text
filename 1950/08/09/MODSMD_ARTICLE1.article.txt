# Dave Harrah Frostbitten In Andes Ascent
## 
### 
Dave Harrah, a Stanford student,
is being treated in Lima, Peru, to
day in an attempt to save his frost
bitten feet after he and a Harvard
student friend climbed a mountain
in South America. The mountain,
known as "The Butcher of the An
des," is four miles high and until
Harrah's expedition was unsealed
and unconquered.
Harrah, 23, of Seattle, a senior
philosophy student, and James
Maxwell, 24, of Braintree, Mass., a
Harvard University student, con
quered 21,769-ioot Mount Yerupaja
• —the highest previously unclimbed
peak in the Americas —Saturday.
They reached the summit late in
the afternoon and, when darkness
descended, were caught on the way
down without fire, food, or sleeping
bags in gale winds and sub-zero
cold. Harrah was rushed 135 miles
to Lima yesterday for medical
treatment. Maxwell suffered a
frostbitten toe but did not need to
be sent to Lima.
The two climbers were with a
party of three other Harvard stu
dents and Charles C. Crush of Pa
cific Grove, who took his Master's
degree in education at Stanford in
1949.
Harrah and Maxwell left their
20.600-foot "high camp" Saturday
at 10 a.m. in the expedition's fifth
assault on the summit.
The pair soon gained the ridge
and fought theii way to the top.
They struggled upwai'd through the
fternoon, knowing that to continue
might mean a terrible night on the
ice-capped peak. At 5 p.m. they
became the first men in history to
scale the peak.
A rescue party met them coming
down 24 hours later.
The party of Stanford and Har
vard Alpine Clubbers left Miami
June 22 for their scheduled 70-day
expedition in the Andes. In addi
tion to climbing Yerupaja — their
chief objective — they planned to
undertake a geological survey and
chart weather in the unmapped, un
inhabited area.
