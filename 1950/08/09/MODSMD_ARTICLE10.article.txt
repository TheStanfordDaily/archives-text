# MATS New Job: Fly Korean War Airlift
## 
### 
In the bitter Korean fighting,
Uncle Sam's MATS (Military Air
Transport Service) is spreading its
wings in the second major test that
its flyers have faced since the big
job accomplished during World
War II
The spectacularly successful Ber
lin Airlift of 1948-49 was a mass
production, assembly - line feat,
notes the National Geographic So
ciety. At peak activity, the flying
boxcars of "Operation Vittles"' took
iff ever/ hree minutes around the
clock, fair weather or foul, to bring
/ital :-UMplies to the Russian
blocked west zones of Germany's
capital. Loads averaged a daily rate
■jf some 8,000 tons.
The Korea Airlift presents alto
gether different geographic prob
lems, as well as risks incident to
hot" instead of "cold" war. The
Berlin lifelines the advantages
of being overland and relatively
short, varying from 80 to 175 miles,
depending on bases used. Much of
che cargo was coal from the con
venient German Ruhr.
In contrast, the Korean front, al
though fairly close to secondary
supply sources in Japan, is 5,650
miles from MATS's California home
base at he airport of Fairfield-
Suisun, for example. It is 4,450
miles from big Hickam Field in
(lawaii; 3,850 miles from Fairbanks,
Alaska; and 1,500 miles from Clark
Field in the Philippines.
Such distances involve time-de

vouring as well as dangerous flights
over the vast stretches of Pacific
waters. Then, when the transport
planes arrive in South Korea with
materiel for the fighting men, they
lack the modern and efficient air
ports that were available at Berlin.
News dispatches report advance
stations are necessarily improvised
landing spots with primitive mark
ing and signal equipment.
Today's Military Air Transport
Service is a consolidation of the
Army's former Air Transport Com
mand (ATC) and the Naval Air
Transport Service (NATS). It was
born June 1, 1948. just 21 days be
fore the Russian blockade and 26
days before the start of the Berlin
Airlift.
In war or peace, MATS has the
basic assignment of carrying cargo
and personnel wherever U.S. mili
tary interests may dictate. But this
organization is far more than a
simple transportation agency. It
also administers U.S. air bases, from
Labrador to Saudi Arabia. It pro
vides air routes, communications,
and navigational aids to all military
airmen, maintains an Air Rescue
Service, and collects and distributes
the all-important weather informa
tion.
Even before the Korean hostili
ties. the globe-scattered personnel
of MATS numbered more than 60.-
000 persons, both military and ci
vilian.

The spectacularly successful Ber
lin Airlift of 1948-49 was a mass
production, assembly - line feat,
notes the National Geographic So
ciety. At peak activity, the flying
boxcars of "Operation Vittles"' took
iff ever/ hree minutes around the
clock, fair weather or foul, to bring
/ital :-UMplies to the Russian
blocked west zones of Germany's
capital. Loads averaged a daily rate
■jf some 8,000 tons.
The Korea Airlift presents alto
gether different geographic prob
lems, as well as risks incident to
hot" instead of "cold" war. The
Berlin lifelines the advantages
of being overland and relatively
short, varying from 80 to 175 miles,
depending on bases used. Much of
che cargo was coal from the con
venient German Ruhr.
In contrast, the Korean front, al
though fairly close to secondary
supply sources in Japan, is 5,650
miles from MATS's California home
base at he airport of Fairfield-
Suisun, for example. It is 4,450
miles from big Hickam Field in
(lawaii; 3,850 miles from Fairbanks,
Alaska; and 1,500 miles from Clark
Field in the Philippines.
Such distances involve time-de

vouring as well as dangerous flights
over the vast stretches of Pacific
waters. Then, when the transport
planes arrive in South Korea with
materiel for the fighting men, they
lack the modern and efficient air
ports that were available at Berlin.
News dispatches report advance
stations are necessarily improvised
landing spots with primitive mark
ing and signal equipment.
Today's Military Air Transport
Service is a consolidation of the
Army's former Air Transport Com
mand (ATC) and the Naval Air
Transport Service (NATS). It was
born June 1, 1948. just 21 days be
fore the Russian blockade and 26
days before the start of the Berlin
Airlift.
In war or peace, MATS has the
basic assignment of carrying cargo
and personnel wherever U.S. mili
tary interests may dictate. But this
organization is far more than a
simple transportation agency. It
also administers U.S. air bases, from
Labrador to Saudi Arabia. It pro
vides air routes, communications,
and navigational aids to all military
airmen, maintains an Air Rescue
Service, and collects and distributes
the all-important weather informa
tion.
Even before the Korean hostili
ties. the globe-scattered personnel
of MATS numbered more than 60.-
000 persons, both military and ci
vilian.
In the bitter Korean fighting,
Uncle Sam's MATS (Military Air
Transport Service) is spreading its
wings in the second major test that
its flyers have faced since the big
job accomplished during World
War II
