# Stanford Man Writes Story of House Initiation
## 
### AL BERRY 
Edward Wilson, who graduated
from Stanford last spring, has hit
the big time!
The Stanford English major is the
author of a short story called "The
Men From the Boys," currently ap
pearing in the latest Esquire maga
zine. Wilson wrote this story of the
"informal" part of a fraternity in
itiation for a creative writing class
here at Stanford. He was an Eng
lish major, and belonged to one of
the local fraternities.
To the readers of "The Men From
the Boys," the story will probably
appear as a slightly Actionized, very
well written indictment of the fra
ternity system as a whole. But to
the men in the Greek-letter outfits,
we think, the story will appear as
an honest criticism of the shabbiest
part of a great American institution.
The story takes eyou through the
hazing part of not only Wilsons but
every fraternity's initiation cere
mony. This is the part wherein the
"fools,' the "jerks," the "goats," or
the "pigs' (as the pledges are lov
ingly called) are "shaped up." This
Hell Week—which usually lasts for
two or three days — consists of
strenuous exercises on the part of
the initiates, midnight sprints
around the block, inconvenient eat
ing positions, and—of course—the

liberal or semi-liberal Use of the
paddle.
The story—we emphasize—is fic
tion although written in the first
person. The main character is one
of the brothers named Al, who
takes a slightly dismal and confused
view of the proceedings while de
scribing them to the reader.
The interesting thing about the
story is not its fictionalized content,
but rather that it will strike very
close to home for most fraternity
men. The story doesn't happen to
apply directly to my fraternity, nor
is it applicable to any of the local
houses in a strict sense. But the
course it takes you through will be
vaguely, perhaps alarmingly, fa
miliar to every fraternity man who
reads it.
Anyway, we recommend the story
highly. To some there will be a
message in it. To others, the vast
majority who very properly don't
cart much, it makes extremely in
teresting reading. (Ed. note: Not
recommended for pledges.)
