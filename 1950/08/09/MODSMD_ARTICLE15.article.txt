### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 (UP) â€”
Carroll L. Wilson resigned as gen
eral manager of the Atomic Energy
Commission today with the blunt
explanation that he lacks "confi
dence" in its new chairman, Gordon
Dean.
He also accused other members of
the commission of meddling torn
much in the day-to-day manage
ment of the $4,000,000,000 atomic
program, and warned that it may
bog down this country's drive to
maintain an A - bomb lead over
Russia.
President Truman accepted the
resignation, effective next Tuesday,
in a terse letter that made no ref
erence to the backstage clash.
He announced that Carleton
Shugg, Wilson's deputy for the.past
two years, will take over as acting
general manager.
'X -.n and other members of the
commission had no comment or.
Wilson's parting blast.
