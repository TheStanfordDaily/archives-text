JERSEY CITY, N.J., Aug. 8 (UP)
—Ray Sugar Robinson was still de
termined tonight to risk his welter
weight crown twice tomorrow for
j one dollar at Roosevelt Stadium—
j on the scales and in the ring.
Although the world's No. 1 boxer
is the fight game's most notorious
i "run-out guy," he seemed set to
, tackle blond Charley Fusari in their
j 15-round bout tomorrow night.
Their tilt is scheduled as a title
scrap, but Sugar Ray can lose his
championship tomorrow at the offi
cial weigh-in in the ball park if he
weighs more than 147 pounds, the
welter limit.
Robinson virtually "beat himself"
| down to 147'4 pounds late today
after doing five miles of road work
J and boxing four rounds. After step
ping off the scales, Ray repeated
that tomorrow night's fight would
be his last deefnse of the welter
weight title if he gets his promised
; shot at Jake LaMotta's middle
! weight Crown.
