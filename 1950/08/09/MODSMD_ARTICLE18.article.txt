CHICAGO, Aug. 8 (UP)—The
Big Ten announced today that it
will televise football games this fall
to theaters where admission will be
charged the public.
The conference, one of the na
tion's wealthiest in point of gate re
ceipts, said member schools may
make their 1950 games available on
a "live" basis via large-screen the
ater television. Conference Com
missioner K. L. (Tug) Wilson said
post-game films then may be aired
locally on regular television broad
casts to home-set owners.
Actually the Big Ten went to
some length to explain that it
doesn't consider its theater program
'"live" television. A spokesman said
there would be a 25-second lag be
tween scenes at the game and on
the screen after the impulses travel
over a closed circuit which cannot
be tapped by home sets.
Wilson said the program, to be
presented in an arrangement with
Paramount Theaters, Inc., on a one
year basis, will be confined to Chi
cago and Detroit.
