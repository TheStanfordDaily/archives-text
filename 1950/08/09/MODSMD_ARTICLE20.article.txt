# California Typist Breaks Channel Record As Shirley Mae Fails Again
## 
### 
DOVER, England, Aug. 8 (UP)—
A 31 - year - old California typist
broke Gertrude Ederle's 24-year
old record for swimming the Eng
lish Channel today, while a heart
broken, hysterical Shirley May
France was dragged from the chop
py waters in danger of drowning.
In the race that began unan
nounced on the dark coast of Cap
Gris Nez, France, after midnight,
Florence Chadwick, professional
rough - water swimmer from San
Diego, stroked the 21 miles to Dover
in 13 hours and 20 minutes. She
cut an hour and 19 minutes off the
record set by Miss Ederle in 1926.
Shirley May, dazed and weak,

was pulled into her pilot boat as
she floundered five miles from the
English coast, in sight of the white
cliffs of Dover. It was her second
failure. Last September she was
taken from the channel six miles
from shore, exhausted by screaming
that she wanted to swim on.
It was a day of triumph and
laughter for Miss Chadwick, who
fulfilled a lifelong dream when she
churned across the Channel faster
than any woman in history. She
was the 32nd successful Channel
swimmer and the 12th woman to
make it.
And at 31 she was one of the old- j
est women to swim it. Official rec- j
ords do not give the ages of the I
Channel swimmers, but old-timers
said Mrs. Ivy Hill, Sheffield, Eng
land, who crossed in 15 hours and
nine minutes in 1927, was in "her \
30's."
Miss Chadwick, who swam in her ;
first meet when she was isx years j
old, waded unheralded into the i
glassy waters of the Channel at Cap '
Gris Nez at 2:40 a.m. (6:40 p.m.
Monday, PDT).
Shirley shoved off 30 minutes
later, and the race was on. But as
the darkness gave way to dawn
it became evident that the more ex- |
perienced Miss Chadwick was pull- ■
ing away from her young rival. I

Her lead stretched to one mile, thui
five miles.
Throughout the grueling day Miss
Chadwick swam methodically,
pausing only a few times to nibble
on sugar. Shirley May trod water
many times to eat, to retch, to com
plain, to sip a dextrose preparation,
and to shout gasping into a radio
microphone.
The water was warm for the
Channel, about 60 degrees Fahren
heit, but both swimmers ran into
a strong adverse tide about five
miles off the Dover shore. Miss
Chadwick, who had trained rigor
ously in the shark-infested waters
of the Persian Gulf, mastered it.
The coastal defense artillery held
up its practice for two hours until
the California woman swam out of
target range. They let loose their
big guns. The sea gulls set up a
raucous cry, matched by the shouts
of the spectators watching Miss
Chadwick swimming in through St.
Margaret's Bay.

from shore, exhausted by screaming
that she wanted to swim on.
It was a day of triumph and
laughter for Miss Chadwick, who
fulfilled a lifelong dream when she
churned across the Channel faster
than any woman in history. She
was the 32nd successful Channel
swimmer and the 12th woman to
make it.
And at 31 she was one of the old- j
est women to swim it. Official rec- j
ords do not give the ages of the I
Channel swimmers, but old-timers
said Mrs. Ivy Hill, Sheffield, Eng
land, who crossed in 15 hours and
nine minutes in 1927, was in "her \
30's."
Miss Chadwick, who swam in her ;
first meet when she was isx years j
old, waded unheralded into the i
glassy waters of the Channel at Cap '
Gris Nez at 2:40 a.m. (6:40 p.m.
Monday, PDT).
Shirley shoved off 30 minutes
later, and the race was on. But as
the darkness gave way to dawn
it became evident that the more ex- |
perienced Miss Chadwick was pull- ■
ing away from her young rival. I

Her lead stretched to one mile, thui
five miles.
Throughout the grueling day Miss
Chadwick swam methodically,
pausing only a few times to nibble
on sugar. Shirley May trod water
many times to eat, to retch, to com
plain, to sip a dextrose preparation,
and to shout gasping into a radio
microphone.
The water was warm for the
Channel, about 60 degrees Fahren
heit, but both swimmers ran into
a strong adverse tide about five
miles off the Dover shore. Miss
Chadwick, who had trained rigor
ously in the shark-infested waters
of the Persian Gulf, mastered it.
The coastal defense artillery held
up its practice for two hours until
the California woman swam out of
target range. They let loose their
big guns. The sea gulls set up a
raucous cry, matched by the shouts
of the spectators watching Miss
Chadwick swimming in through St.
Margaret's Bay.
DOVER, England, Aug. 8 (UP)—
A 31 - year - old California typist
broke Gertrude Ederle's 24-year
old record for swimming the Eng
lish Channel today, while a heart
broken, hysterical Shirley May
France was dragged from the chop
py waters in danger of drowning.
In the race that began unan
nounced on the dark coast of Cap
Gris Nez, France, after midnight,
Florence Chadwick, professional
rough - water swimmer from San
Diego, stroked the 21 miles to Dover
in 13 hours and 20 minutes. She
cut an hour and 19 minutes off the
record set by Miss Ederle in 1926.
Shirley May, dazed and weak,

was pulled into her pilot boat as
she floundered five miles from the
English coast, in sight of the white
cliffs of Dover. It was her second
failure. Last September she was
taken from the channel six miles
from shore, exhausted by screaming
that she wanted to swim on.
