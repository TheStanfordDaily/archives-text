# Phillies' Simmons Gets One Month Guard Reprieve

### 
NEW YORK, Aug. 8 (UP) â€”
Southpaw star Curt Simmons re
ported back to the National League
leading Philadelphia Phillies to
night and will be able to throw his
weight into the Phillies' pennant
drive for at least a month.
The young ace, who has won 14
games, was given a month to "clean
up his personal affairs" after 10
days of training with the 28th Na
tional Guard Division at Indian
town Gap, Pa. The division has
been called to active duty. There
was an outside chance that he
would still be with the Phillies in
September but neither Simmons
nor Manager Eddie Sawyer ven
tured such a prediction.
Simmons, a $65,000 bonus beauty,
has a 14-6 record.
