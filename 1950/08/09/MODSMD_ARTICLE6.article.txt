# Austin Charges Russians With Korean War Blame
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Aug. 8 (UP)—The United States, naming
Russia for the first time in tb 5 United Nations as the power behind
the North Korean invasion, charged today that the Kremlin could
call off the Red attack if it wanted to.
Reversing his policy of not pinning the blame directly on the

Russians, American Delegate War
ren R. Austin solemnly asked the
Security Council:
"Who has the influence and pow
er to call off the invading North
Korean army?" Austin immediate
ly answered his own question: "The
Soviet Union," he said.
Austin warned that the obstruc
tion tactics of Soviet Delegate Jacob
A. Malik as Council president could
keep the Council "stalled in dead
center" for the rest of the month,
when his term runs out.
The American delegate proposed
adjournment until Thursday after
noon to give Malik time to contact
Moscow to see if the Kremlin is
willing to change its UN tactics
that threaten to kill all Council
business until September 1.
Shortly afterward, the Council
adjourned to meet again Thursday.
Austin's sensational move came
after three hours of a hectic meet
ing in which Malik tied up the
Council in procedural knots for the
fifth straight meeting in maneuvers
to block admission of the South Ko
rean representative to the table.
It was to prevent use of Moscow's
45th veto to bar a South Korean
representative from Council ses
sions that Austin'made his adjourn
ment proposal.
Austin's statement that Russia
could call off the North Korean in
vasion marked a sharp departure
from the policy pursued by the U.S.
ever since the Korean case ex
ploded on the UN.
Up to now. the U.S. had carefully
avoided naming the Kremlin as the
string-puller in the Korean conflict
in order to leave room for the Rus
sians to bow out gracefully if they
decided they had gone too far.
"It is not edifying," Austin said,
his senatorial voice booming, "to
witness the representative of the
Soviet Union using his position as
president to make these charges
that the United States is the aggres
sor in Korea; and doing this on the
time of the Security Council and
on the time of the poor boys over
there who are under fire while we
monkey with and twist the rules . . .
for the purpose ... of preventing
consideration of a (American) res
olution . . . which has the tend
ency to narrow the area of conflict."
The U.S. resolution, which had
legal priority, would condemn the
North Koreans for defying the UN's
cease - fire order and call on UN
members to try to contain the Ko
rean conflict.

the North Korean invasion, charged today that the Kremlin could
call off the Red attack if it wanted to.
Reversing his policy of not pinning the blame directly on the

Russians, American Delegate War
ren R. Austin solemnly asked the
Security Council:
"Who has the influence and pow
er to call off the invading North
Korean army?" Austin immediate
ly answered his own question: "The
Soviet Union," he said.
Austin warned that the obstruc
tion tactics of Soviet Delegate Jacob
A. Malik as Council president could
keep the Council "stalled in dead
center" for the rest of the month,
when his term runs out.
The American delegate proposed
adjournment until Thursday after
noon to give Malik time to contact
Moscow to see if the Kremlin is
willing to change its UN tactics
that threaten to kill all Council
business until September 1.
Shortly afterward, the Council
adjourned to meet again Thursday.
Austin's sensational move came
after three hours of a hectic meet
ing in which Malik tied up the
Council in procedural knots for the
fifth straight meeting in maneuvers
to block admission of the South Ko
rean representative to the table.
It was to prevent use of Moscow's
45th veto to bar a South Korean
representative from Council ses
sions that Austin'made his adjourn
ment proposal.
Austin's statement that Russia
could call off the North Korean in
vasion marked a sharp departure
from the policy pursued by the U.S.
ever since the Korean case ex
ploded on the UN.
Up to now. the U.S. had carefully
avoided naming the Kremlin as the
string-puller in the Korean conflict
in order to leave room for the Rus
sians to bow out gracefully if they
decided they had gone too far.
"It is not edifying," Austin said,
his senatorial voice booming, "to
witness the representative of the
Soviet Union using his position as
president to make these charges
that the United States is the aggres
sor in Korea; and doing this on the
time of the Security Council and
on the time of the poor boys over
there who are under fire while we
monkey with and twist the rules . . .
for the purpose ... of preventing
consideration of a (American) res
olution . . . which has the tend
ency to narrow the area of conflict."
The U.S. resolution, which had
legal priority, would condemn the
North Koreans for defying the UN's
cease - fire order and call on UN
members to try to contain the Ko
rean conflict.
