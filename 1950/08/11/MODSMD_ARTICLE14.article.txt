# Farm Symphony Gets 'Fair' Rating
## 
### PHILIP CARTER 
The Stanford Music Department
presented a concert by the Stan
ford Symphony Tuesday evening in
Memorial Auditorium. The orches
tra was directed by Sandor Salgo,
with Gabor Rejto the 'cello soloist.
The general effect of the concert
was fair and the program was well
received by a large audience. How
ever, there were noticeable defi
ciencies in technique and intonation
which marred the music. The fine
playing of the 'cellos and violas was
an exception to a generally loose
performance.
The Schuman 'Cello Concerto was
well played by Gabor Rejto. It was
good to hear this beautiful though
often neglected work. The orches
tra experienced some difficulty in
maintaining synchronization with
the soloist.
For this reviewer, sitting in the
orchestra, the most satisfying num
bers were the Satie-Debussy "Gym
nopedies" and the last two move
ments of the Schubert Fifth Sym
phony.
