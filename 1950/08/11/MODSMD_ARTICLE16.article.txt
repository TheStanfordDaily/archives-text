# 'Rain' Rated Best of Summer Play Season
## 
### DUANE SPILSBURY 
Wednesday night, the Stanford
Players opened the eight-day run
of their last offering in the current
summer stock season with the pro
duction of "Rain." And in this one
they really ovtdid themselves.
First of all, they had an excellent
story situation to work with. Som
erset Maugham's absorbing story of
the fantastic and omnipotent ego of
a "Christian" missionary is famous
enough to need no commentary.
However, the Stanford Players'
creative production of the play ver
sion of Maugham's story deserves
congratulations.
The mental workings of the Rev
erend Davidson and his subtle and
disastrous warping of the Christian
spirit of love and humility provide,
in the Stanfo'.d production, a full
sense of horror at man's possibili
ties for evil. When this evil of
"Christian duty" reaches such
Olympian heights of insane and un
swervable egomania, the horror is
increased tenfold. •
The sets for "Rain" were simple
and well done. The gloomy and ex
plosive depression of the rain, re
produced by the special effects and
lighting departments, was one of
the highlights of the play. And the
lighting background for the final
breakdown of Davidson was superb.
A full share of the success of the
production rests squarely with the
cast. There were some weaknesses,
however, some parts which dropped
below the general excellence.
The action began slowly and the
climax of the first act was some
what empty and hurried. Fred C.

Forsman. who played the Reverend
Davidson, went through the actions
of a man deeply insulted. But there
was no preparation in the action for
the subtle and imponderable evil
that had been inadvertently re
leased. Again, many of the verbal
clashes throughout the play were
carried on at a toe-to-toe level of
screaming, the force of the speeches
prevailing over their content. And
the play was somewhat wordy in
spots. For example, the marvelous
voice and manner of Forsman were
indeed a deadly replica of i'»vorst
in ministerial piety, but Fivd didn't
really approach the Jovian evil of
Maugham's missionary until he let
his brooding and dark presence
speak for him. At these times, the
vicious conflict of reason vs. in
stinct was cut to a cross-section for
examination and wonder.
Other excellent characterizations
included a sincere and genuine por
trait of emotional collapse by Joan
Spencer in *he difficult role of Sadie
Thompson. Alfred Wilkinson and
Robert Hagopian provided a fine
sense of normalcy and intelligence
during the inhuman conflict. Wil
kinson had a particularly fine stage
presence. Mrs. Davidson's change
from haughty righteousness to be
wilderment was well developed by
Mary Marks. Don Campbell gave
force to the part of the loyal Ser
geant O'Hava, and Russell Caprio
finally got a part which made use
of his excellent talent for character
ization.
To Director Vardac belong con
gratulations for a well - conceived
and effective production, the best
to come out of the summer season.

Forsman. who played the Reverend
Davidson, went through the actions
of a man deeply insulted. But there
was no preparation in the action for
the subtle and imponderable evil
that had been inadvertently re
leased. Again, many of the verbal
clashes throughout the play were
carried on at a toe-to-toe level of
screaming, the force of the speeches
prevailing over their content. And
the play was somewhat wordy in
spots. For example, the marvelous
voice and manner of Forsman were
indeed a deadly replica of i'»vorst
in ministerial piety, but Fivd didn't
really approach the Jovian evil of
Maugham's missionary until he let
his brooding and dark presence
speak for him. At these times, the
vicious conflict of reason vs. in
stinct was cut to a cross-section for
examination and wonder.
Other excellent characterizations
included a sincere and genuine por
trait of emotional collapse by Joan
Spencer in *he difficult role of Sadie
Thompson. Alfred Wilkinson and
Robert Hagopian provided a fine
sense of normalcy and intelligence
during the inhuman conflict. Wil
kinson had a particularly fine stage
presence. Mrs. Davidson's change
from haughty righteousness to be
wilderment was well developed by
Mary Marks. Don Campbell gave
force to the part of the loyal Ser
geant O'Hava, and Russell Caprio
finally got a part which made use
of his excellent talent for character
ization.
To Director Vardac belong con
gratulations for a well - conceived
and effective production, the best
to come out of the summer season.
Wednesday night, the Stanford
Players opened the eight-day run
of their last offering in the current
summer stock season with the pro
duction of "Rain." And in this one
they really ovtdid themselves.
First of all, they had an excellent
story situation to work with. Som
erset Maugham's absorbing story of
the fantastic and omnipotent ego of
a "Christian" missionary is famous
enough to need no commentary.
However, the Stanford Players'
creative production of the play ver
sion of Maugham's story deserves
congratulations.
The mental workings of the Rev
erend Davidson and his subtle and
disastrous warping of the Christian
spirit of love and humility provide,
in the Stanfo'.d production, a full
sense of horror at man's possibili
ties for evil. When this evil of
"Christian duty" reaches such
Olympian heights of insane and un
swervable egomania, the horror is
increased tenfold. •
The sets for "Rain" were simple
and well done. The gloomy and ex
plosive depression of the rain, re
produced by the special effects and
lighting departments, was one of
the highlights of the play. And the
lighting background for the final
breakdown of Davidson was superb.
A full share of the success of the
production rests squarely with the
cast. There were some weaknesses,
however, some parts which dropped
below the general excellence.
The action began slowly and the
climax of the first act was some
what empty and hurried. Fred C.
