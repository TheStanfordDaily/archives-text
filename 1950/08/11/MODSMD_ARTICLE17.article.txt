## BULL SESSION

It has been called to our attention that the new draft deferment policy,
as outlined on page one of today's Daily, may have a remarkable and dis
astrous effect on the Stanford campus. The new draft policy—which may
very well change tomorrow—states that the government will defer any stu
dents if they are in the upper half of their class scholastically.
This immediately brings to mind just what will happen to the much-be
leaguered average when all the draft-terrorized frosh and sophomores start
to crack the books. It brings to mind the terror of the wartime "on the
ball or on the boat" policy. We think that it will, if carried to an extreme,
have a horrible effect on "the culture and dignity of Stanford" and all the
things that have traditionally been ours. For example, Rossotti's will be
empty on Friday afternoons. All of the under-aged males will have thrown
away their false I.D.'s—they'll be home studying. The Egg will be deserted
on week nights. Everybody will be studying. Rows upon r.ows of empty
seats will fill the theaters. Movie managers will commit suicide. The "Junior
G-Men" will perform alone for the Sunday (licture. The Libe will have to
stay open on Sunday nights, and thousands of students will perish because
they have gulped down an excess of traditionally terrible Cellar coffee. We
will begin to study as much at Stanford as all of the people who don't go here
think we do.
The thing could work like a chain reaction: The draftable students would
study so much that the average would skyrocket. Thus, in order to stay in
school, the non-draftable ones would have to go into competition with them.
Soon the profs would have to start flunking football players. Then the Big
Red would lose—an unheard-of occurrence—and people would say nasty
things about our coaches, and—worse yet—our college colors would be
dipped in the mud because of our terrible athletic showing.
The focus of this dash of super-cramming would, of course, center on the
Stanford women, traditional average raisers. This would have to stop. If
they continued to get startlingly good grades, the naturally more stupid
maies would fall below the "upper half" mark and would be dragged of! to
serve their country. Thus, many girls because of their eagerness would lose
boy friends and possible dates. In addition, coeds who got "A's" and "B's"
would be shunned not only by the men but by their girl friends as well—
they would be, by their own intelligence, lowering their much cherished
ratio.
With the ratio thus lowered, the girls would have no more reason to come
to the Farm, and thus the school would become non-coeducational. The
lower half of the classes would be drafted and with the upper half—girls
seeking greener pastures, there wouldn't be anyone left here. The profes
sors, not having been paid enough to afford a ticket to Berkeley, would prob
ably stay here and starve to death. The Lcland Stanford Junior Farm would
become a ghost town.
We cannot let this happen. Readers, we have reached a crisis, and we
must now act. Each of you, all of you, must write to your Congressman and
tell him to force the Selective Service headquarters to revoke this insidious
policy before it is too late, before our beloved Quad becomes deserted and
can no more resound with the patter of happy ten-minutes-late-to-an-eight
o'clock feet. Act; Act now!
