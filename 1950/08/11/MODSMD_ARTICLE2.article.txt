# Lag Girls to Give Men 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' in Formal Tonight
## 
### 
A touch of summertime magic
will transform Lagunita's dining
hall into the Forest of Arden to
morrow night. The changed room
will be the scene of the residence's
Summer Formal. "A Midsummer
Night's Dream."
There will be dancing from 0 to
1 to the music of Howard Frederic's
orchestra. The orchestra has played
before at Lagunita and was invited
again to play at Lagunita's final so
cial event of the summer quarter.
In keeping with the theme of sum
mer enchantment, there will be
dancing on the terrace under the
stars.
Tickets for the formal are $3 a
couple. They are on sale only to
Stanford women. A few tickets will
be available for women living in
other residences or off campus
through Ann Cravath in Casa Eu
calypto, who is in charge of ticket
sales.
Since the dance is an all - resi
dence event, the hall will be open
till 1:30, and guests may stay in
the residence till that time. Lagu
nita girls will not have to sign out
for l:3o's, though girls planning to
take 2:3o's or overnights must sign
out as usual. One-thirties or equiv

alent overnights do not count on
late-leave quotas.
The refreshment committee, un
der Marilyn Wright, has arranged
for sherbet punch and sandwiches J
to be served at tables in the court.
Decorations for the affair will be
in blue and silver, with romance as
the keynote. Ruth FitzGerald and
Miliana Drachman, who are head
ing this committee, have planned
for murals oi Puck, spirit of ca
price in Shakespeare's play and ;
patron of the dance. He will feel |
right at home among the silver
boughs and forest flowers planned
as a background.
The dance is the last residence 1
event before the eight-week sched
ule dead week sets in. Previous
events on Lagunita's social calendar
included an open house, an after
noon lemonade party, and various
exchange parties and casa events.
