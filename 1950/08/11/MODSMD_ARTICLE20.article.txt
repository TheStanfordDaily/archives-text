### 
TOKYO. Friday, Aug. 11 (UP) â€”
American troops raced into battle on
a new front today to defend the east
(coast port of Pohang from Commu
flifcts who had smashed into the city's
outskirts.
A battle for the railroad station was
jr. progress on the northwestern edge
pf the city. Both American and South
Korean troops were battling the in
vaders.
A spokesman at Eighth Army
headquarters said the North Korean
assault on Pohang was the gravest
present threat to the Americans in
Korea.
At Pohang the Americans have
their best airfield in Korea. There
tfiey also have a secondary port cap
#b'e taking some of the load off the
flaain U.S. supply port of Pusan, 62
wiles to the south. There the U.S.
Jft Cavalry Division landed July 18.
By taking the city, the Reds would
f.pt of! the South Korean Third Di
vision which is fighting at the north
eastern tip of the Allied defense line
jpst south of Yongdok. From Pohang
the Communists could attempt a
(hive straight down the coast to'Po
forng or they could thrust to the

southwest, ripping Allied communi
cations and supply lines.
On the southern front in the battle
for Chinju U.S. troops were within
two miles of the Communist base.
The Communist force stabbing at
Pohang came down through the rug
ged mountains to the north. It was
strengthened by guerrillas who had
been hiding in the mountain area
since the start of the war. U.S. Eighth
Army headquarters estimated there
were about 10,000 troops in guerrillas
in the invasion force.
Early this week the North Korean
troops pushed southward about 10
miles inland from Yongdok without
opposition. They made slow progress
as they advanced through the moun
tains, picking up guerrillas on the
way. It was not until they reached a
point about 15 miles northwest of Po

hang that they ran into South Ko
rean troops trying to head them oil.
By then the Communists were more
than 20 miles inside the Allies' north
ern defense line running westward
from Yongdok.
The seriousness of the Communist
attack on Pohang was emphasized by
the fact that Eighth Army headquar
ters regarded it as a greater danger
than the North Korean breakthrough
at the southeast corner of the Nak
tong River bulge brideghead.
The American troops raced into the
light for Pohang after the Commu
nists captured Kigye only eight miles
away. A front dispatch from U.P
Correspondent Poats at Eighth Army
headquarters reported that hy this
morning the North Korean advance
had reached the outskirts of Pohang.
If the Communists should take Po

hang they would cut of! South Ko
rean forces holding the northeastern
end of the Allied line around Yong
dok and be in an excellent position to
disrupt American supply lines from
Pusan.
United Press correspondent Ru
theford Poats reported from Eighth
Army headquarters that there was
no indication of the size of the
American force which arrived in
Pohang last night and went into
battle at daybreak.
