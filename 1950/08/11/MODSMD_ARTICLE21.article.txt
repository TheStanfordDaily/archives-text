Winston Churchill's British Conserv
atives suffered two rebuffs in the Eu

what was expected to bo an important
state-of-the-world address by the
wartime Prime Minister.
As Churchill emerged as i poten
tial defense minister for .ill Western
Europe — including Germany — his
Conservatives were assailed on the
two most important items they have
advanced here thus far:
That Western Germany rearm and
become a full and equal partner in
the defunse of democratic Europe,
and that the French plan to pool
Western coal and steel be carried out
under the Council of Europe.
Dr. Carlo Schmid, German Social
Democrat leader, said bluntly that
Germany could not agree to rearm
until Western European nations
joined in a United States of Europe.
, The assembly applauded as Schmid
declared:
"Ask us for work, ask us for work
men, ask us for industrial production.
But do ot ask us for a German army
tintil after a European political au
thority is set up."
French Foreign Minister Robert
Schuman, who originally advanced
the industry pool plan, insisted that
France could not accept the Conserv
ative proposal to put it under the
Council of Europe.
Meanwhile speculation grew that
Churchill may have decided to modi
fy some of the ideas ho originally in
| tended to present in his address.
fie had planned, according to reli
able reports, to make a stirring appeal
| for all-out military preparedness, in
cluding establishment of a European
army.
Churchill originally was slated to
talk today, but only an hour before
! the time he was to speak word spread
| here that he had postponed his ap
pearance until tomorrow. His closest
j confidantes said it would be his most
dramatic speech since 1940. when he
j rallied Britain from Dunkirk to vic
tory.
