on the history of Stanford foot
hall. Next week Cahn will tell of
the Big Red Machines from the
return to the grid game from
rugby to the advent of the 1940
Wow Boys.)
Dearie, do you remember when in
1891 —?
Of course you don't, but that's
when it started for the Big Red
Machine. A boast by Herbert Hoo
ver, then an unknown student, to a
group of .California braggarts that
Stanford could lick the California
varsity produced such hilarity on
the Bear campus that Hoover took
it upon himself to see that his boast
was completed.
Hoover organized and was finan
cial manager of the first Stanford
team in 1891 with the one purpose
of beating the big football noise of
the West, California.
Nicknamed "Jordan's School
boys" by the Berkeley crowd, ; the
Cards had little trouble winning
games in 1891 from Hopkins Acad
emy and the Berkeley Gymnasium,
but dropped their third go to the
Olympic Club. They were then
ready for the first Big One which
was scheduled for the following
spring.
The forgotten purchase of a foot
ball delayed the start of the game,
which saw odds of 25-1 offered on
California, that March 19, 1892. A
curious crowd came out to the San
Francisco Ball Park to watch an
upstart Stanford team \ipset proud
Calfiornia, 14-10.
Actually there were two Big
Games in '92, since a return match
was played in San Francisco on
December 17, ending in a 10-10 tie.
Walter Camp, the father of Ameri
can football, was the coach, while
J. R. Whittemore was Stanford's
first captain.
Pob Bliss coached the '93 squad,
which was undefeated but was tied
by California.
The 1894 club edged California,
tf-0, and then met and were de
feated by a visiting Chicago Uni
versity team. Moving to Los Ange
les,- the squads met twice more with
Stanford measuring the Maroons
both times, no doubt initiating Chi
cago's hesitancy for competition.
Cardinal sweaters marked with a
block "S" gave the '95 varsity a
collegiate look which their prede
cessors lacked. California held the
Cards to a tie, proving it's what's in
the uniform that counts.
The '97 varsity, under G. H.
Brooke, set a then Big Game scor
ing record by waxing the Berkeley
boys 28-0. Parker and Burnett led
the attack.
Coached by Field Yost, the 1900
team whipped California. Two
years later Yost brought his point
a-minute Michigan squad to Pasa

dena in the first Rose Bowl and
pulled a Benedict Arnold by
trouncing Stanford 42-0.
Michigan didn't know about the
platoon system then and used no
substitutes, while the Cards were
plagued by their usual injuries and
were forced to use "as many as six
replacements."
Coming back strongly in 1903 af
ter dropping the 02 Big Game and
the Bowl tilt, Stanford, led by
speedy Chet Murphy and field goal
kicker "Tubby" Lee, trounced the
Sherman Indians at Los Angeles
and tied California.
Jimmy Lanagan, appointed head
coach in 1903, never dropped a game
to California, and his '04 eleven shut
out Utah, 57-0; Oregon, 35-0; Colo
rado, 33-0; and the Bears, 18-0.
An upset win over California in
1905 marked the last gridiron meet
ing of the rivals for fourteen years.
Because of mounting injuries, rug
by, . a more wide-open game, was
substituted •by the agreement of
Stanford President Jordan and Cal
ifornia head man Wheeler.
Somewhat doubtfully, St?, .ford
accepted rugby, which soon drew
large crowds and proved a fast, ex
citing sport.
Once more under the leadership
of Lanagan, the novice Card team
beat California both in '06 and '07.
Nine games were played between
the Cards and the Bears. Stanford
won five of these, the 1912 "Mud
Battle" ending in a tie. Relations
were severed in 1914 because of an
eligibility dispute.
"Little" Santa Clara became the
Big Game rival in 1915. Stanford
took three games from the Broncos
during the five years of competition.
Rugby bowed out with the ad
vent of the war, due to the absence
of many of those trained in the
adopted game.
