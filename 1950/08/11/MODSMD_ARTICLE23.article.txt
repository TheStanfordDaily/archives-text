CHICAGO, Aug. 10 (UP)—l)s>ak
Walker, Southern Methodist's back- j
field sparkplug for four seasons, was |
named today as the starting left
halfback for the 1950 College All- I
Stars—Philadelphia Eagles football
classic in Soldier Field tomorrow
night.
Head Coach Eddie Anderson
listed the collegiate starting back
field as quarterback Travis Tidwell
of Auburn, right half Hall Haynes
of Santa Clara, fullback Fred Mor
rison of Ohio State, and Walker.
While Tidwell and Morrison have
been regarded as the probable
starters in their jobs since the first ■
week of practice, Walker faced stiff
competition from North Carolina's
Charlie Justice and Notre Dame's
Emil "Red" Sitko for left half. !
Haynes had. to beat out Lynn
Chandnois of Michigan State and
Red Coutre of Notre Dame.
Sitko's bid was damaged when he j
suffered a pulled leg muscle which
kept him out of numerous practice
sessions. Justice, however, showed
well throughout the training period '
and is expected to share the left
half job with Walker on nearly ;
even terms.
Anderson picked a hard-hitting j
and fairly speedy offensive line to
work with the flashy backfirld.
North Carolina's Art Weiner, rated
as the best pass reeciver to come
out of college since Don Hutson, j
was placed at left end and Notve 1
Dame's Jim Martin, who played end
for two years before finishing at
tackle last season, was assigned to
the right flank.
For tackles Anderson selected ;
Leon Manley of Oklahoma and Don
Campora of the College of the Pa
cific, with Porter Payne of Georgia
and George Hughes of William and
Mary at guards. Minnesota's giant
Clayton Tonnemaker is the center, j
The professional Eagles are fa
vored in the game.
