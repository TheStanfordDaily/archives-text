LONDON, Aug. 10 (UP)— The
International Athletic Federation
today accepted as world track and
field records 10 recent perform
ances, seven of them by Americans.
Sweden, Hungary, and Russia
were credited with one new record
each.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia's crack sprint relay team
composed of Mel Patton, Ron Fra
zier, George Pasquali, and Norm
Stocks had four marks accepted—
breaking the world's 880-yard relay
andh 800-meter records twice each.
On '"May 14, 1949, the Trojan
speedsters clocked 1:24.4 for the
880-yard relay at Fresno. This was
accepted as a new mark both for the
80-yard event and also for the 800-
meter relay. On May 20. 1949, at
Los Angeles, the Trojans lowered
both figures to 1:24 flat. The pre

another USC team in 1934.
Hurdler Dick Attlesey of South
ern Cal gave his school a share in
two more world marks when he
covered the 110-meter hurdles in
13.6 seconds in the National AAU
Championships' at College Park,
Md., June 24, 1950. That also was
accepted as the mark for the 120-
yard hurdles. He thus equaled the
old record of 13.G seconds set by
Harrison Dillard of Baldwin Wal
lace.
The only non-USC American to
get credit for a new mark at this
time was former Penn State Star
Norwood H. (Barney) Ewell. He

meters in 10.2 seconds as equaling
the world mark held by Americans
Jesse Owens and Harold Davis and
Panama's Lloyd Laßeach.

another record in the book when

17:16.1 had been held by the Uni
