treating for the first time at two points (large arrows) on the Naktong
River defense line. Army and Marine units are within seven miles of
Chinju (1), while near Waegwan (2) U.S. and South Korean troops wiped
out art enemy bridgehead and hurled the enemy haek across the river to
ease one threat to the South Korean provisional capital of Taegu (3).
Some of the heaviest fighting raged at Sin am-hi (4), where the Reels
have established a strong beachhead on the east bank of the Naktong. A
new Communist threat developed with the drive of Red troops
to within 10 miles of Pohang (5) on the east coast. —Acme Teiephoto
