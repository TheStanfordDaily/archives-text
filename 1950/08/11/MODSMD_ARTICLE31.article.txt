CHICAGO, Aug. 10 (UP)—With a
seventh-inning rally during which
they rushed across the tying run just
before the game was called the Chi
cago White Sox salvaged a 1 to 1
tie in an abbreviated nightcap today
after losing the opener of a twin bill
to Detroit, 10 to (?.
Hank Majeski's triple and Mike
MoCormick's single through the
drawn-in Detroit infield enabled the
Sox to even the count against Hal
Newhouser. Phil Masi then hit into
a force play and rain and darkness
forced the umpire to call the contest
with Gus Niarhos at bat.

tie between the two clubs April 130
and was rescheduled for Sept. 9.
