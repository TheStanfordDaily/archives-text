LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Aug. 10 (UP)- Russia today refused to
end.its blockade against United Nations work on Korea and told
. the Security Council it has not supplied arms to the North Korean?
•since it pulled out its occupation troops.
Soviet Delegate Jacob A. Malik, Council president, denounced

a Western "hint" that Russia is
arming the Red Korean invadeva
as "slanderous and unfounded." Ha
insisted all material used in the Re J
assaults was "sold" to the North
Koreans before the Soviet army
withdrew.

arming the Red Koreans came after
the United tSates called on the t,
the United States called on the
Kremlin to stop the invasion by the
North Korean "zombie" regime.
In a blast countering Russian
propaganda on Korea point by
point, American delegate Warren P.
Austin assailed Russia on its refu
sal to invite the South Koreans to
the table unless the North Koreans
also are invited.
"To represent a people, should we
hear the slave driver, the secret po -
liceman, or the puppet governor
who governs because his master has
given him tanks and guns to make
his countrymen tremble and obey. '
Austin asked.
Apparently, it was this part rf
Austin's speech that drew Malik's
angry denial.
It came toward the end of a two
and-a-half-hour regular meetir *
that followed an earlier 90-minute
private session in which the West
tried in vain to get the Russians
stop their "obstruction" of Counc'ii
business in the Korean case.
Another meeting was seheiueJ
for tomorrow afternoon.
