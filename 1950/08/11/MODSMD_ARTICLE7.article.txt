# Draft to Defer Average Raisers
## 
### 
College students planning to con
tinue their education next year will
apparently not be drafted for mili
tary duty within the next year.
Selective Service headquarters
Wednesday authorized deferment of
such students if their grades last
year were in the upper half of their
classes. There is already a regula
tion deferring until the end of the
school year those students whose
draft numbers come up during the
school year.
The new regulation, however, is
only a temporary provision de
signed to clarify the position of stu
dents planning to enroll again in
the fall. Since it also is not manda
tory, a local draft board actually
has the power to draft next year's
students if it considers such action
advisable.
New ,pnd more permanent poli
cies may be drawn up later.
