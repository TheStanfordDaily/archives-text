## BULL SESSION 
### 
Back in the old days, when the lake was full last spring, we had a funny
guy around The Daily named Jawn Hall. Hall had augmented his studies
of journalism with a wonderful one-unit course which consisted of leaping
head first off the top of the art building six times into a bucket of crushed
glass. Consequently Jawn wrote Bull Session.
Jawn had one clever idea that aided him greatly in his Bull Sessionist
activities: he jobbed (H.C.0.) much of his material. In keeping with the fine
old tradition set down by Jawn, we are jobbing an idea which he jobbed from
Time Magazine, which in turn had jobbed it from Nation. And now you
know how a newspaper is put out.
With the H-bomb, the. A-bomb, and the XYZ-bomb all set to blow the
human race t°. somebody's eternity, it occurred to whomever Nation jobbed
this idea from, that it would be interesting to note just how the various news
papers and periodicals would handle this biggest stpry. It also occurred to
Time, Hall, and, lastly, myself. Anyway, here is Bull Session's idea of the
morning headlines of The Last Morning:
The Wall Street Journal —
END OF WQRLD FORESEEN IN 24 HOURS

As it must to all, death comes tomorrow to tired, harried, war-haunted
Mother Earth. Sixth in size of the solar system's nine whirling satellites,
third in distance from the sun, Earth alone has Man, was from the start
hailed as the planet least likely to succeed.
—Thanks, Jawn.
