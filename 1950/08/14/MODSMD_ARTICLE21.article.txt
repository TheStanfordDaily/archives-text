NEW YORK, Aug. 13 (UP)â€”Jim
Hearn, one of the prize bargain
basement purchases in recent years,
scored his fourth victory and third
shutout in less than a month today
when he cooled off the blazing kid
Phillies, 2 to 0, to give the New
York Giants a split in a four-game
series with the league leaders.
Hearn, who gave up only four
hits, bested lefty Ken Johnson in
a battle of ex - Cardinal pitcher*
Hearn, who came to the Giants last
month for the $10,000 waiver price,
has been spectacular all the way.
He has pitched a one-hitter, two
four - hitters, a five - hitter, and a
six-hitter in winning four games
and losing one since his first Giant
start on July 17. His six-hitter was
in a .1 to 2 losing effort last week to
Boston, and he has won every other
game.
The Phillies, even in defeat, re
mained five games ahead of the sec
ond-place Boston Braves, who went
down to an 8 to 2 defeat to the
Brooklyn Dodgers. The Dodgers
went into third place, two percent
age points ahead of the Cardinals,
who suffered a 3 to 2 setback at the
hands of a jinx pitcher, Cincinnati's
Ken Raffensberger.
The Pittsburgh Pirates, after los
ing 12 out of their last 13 games,
rose up and defeated the Chicago
Cubs, 7 to 4 and 2 to 0.
Hearn never permitted more than
one man to reach base in any in
ning and his chief superiority over
Johnson was in control. He walked
only one batter and Johnson passed
seven. The Giants got the margin
run in the fifth inning when John
son loaded the bases on two walks
and a fielder's choice. VVes West
rum then beat out an infield hit to
drive home the big run. Eddie
Stanky tripled and Don Mueller
singled in the ninth for the other
Giant run. Johnson gave up six
hits to the Giants, who now have
won 19 of their last 23 games.
Cincinnati made all of Its runs on
four singles, three doubles, and a
walk in the fifth inning to beat the
Cardinals as Raffensberger scored
his 11th victory. The big blow was
a two-run double by Bobby Adams,
who made four hits.
Bridegroom Ervin Palica pitched
his fifth victory and contributed a
double and single as the Dodgers
gained a split in the four-game se
ries at Boston. Pewee Reese and
Carl Furillo each made three hits
and Reese drove in three runs.
Cliff Chambers and Mel Queen
each pitched five-hit ball for the
Pirates at Pittsburgh. In the open
er Ralph Kiner hit his 32nd homer
and the 200 th of his career, putting
him ahead of the lifetime pace of
the all-time record holders. Mel
Ott and Babe Ruth. Ott, whose 511
homers are tops for the National,
didn't get his 200 th homer until his
ninth season. This is Kiner's fifth.
Ruth, with the all-time top of 714.
didn't get his 200 th until his sixth
season. Chambers had a no-hitter
until the seventh when Preston
Ward homered. Queen struck out
11 batters and retired the last 13
men in a row in the second game.
The last-place Athletics upset the
Yankees. 5 to 2, as Vic Raschi suf
fered a loss to Philadelphia for the
first time since Sept. 23, 1948. Paul
Lehner made four hits, one a three
run homer to give lefty Lou Brissie

a four-hit triumph. Lehner made 11
hits in 20 times at bat during the
four-game series in which the A's
took two.
The Senators also knocked off a
first division team, beating the Red
Sox, 6 to 5, and giving them the
series, three games to two. The
Nats clinched the win with a four
run rally against Mickey McDer
mott in the sixth. A 1 Zarilla ho
mered for Boston.
The Cleveland Indians beat the
Chicago White Sox, 5 to 2, in the
first game of a doubleheader but
dropped the second. 7 to 5, and re
mained in third place, one percent
age point behind the second-place
Yankees. The Indians scored all
their runs in the eighth inning as
they rallied to win the opener. Bob
Feller, who limited Chicago to six
hits and one run in the first seven
innings, was credited with his 11th
victory. Sam Zoldak pitched the

last two innings for Cleveland. In
the second game, the White Sox
knocked out Dick Weik with a five
run outburst in the first inning an.l
never were headed after that.
