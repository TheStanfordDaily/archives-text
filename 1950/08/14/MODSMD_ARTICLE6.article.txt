## 
### 
TOKYO, Monday, Aug 14 (UP)—Hundreds of North Koreans
charged across the Naktong River before daybreak today in an
assault apparently testing the American defenses preparatory to
a mass attack on Taegu by more than 50,000 Communist troops.
About 500 Red infantrymen made it across the river 14 miles

►southwest of Teagu, but they failed
to break through the U.S. First
Cavalry Division lines. The Com
munists struck at the same area of
the front where First Cavalry
troops have killed an estimated
1,000 Red infiltrators in the last two
days.
The thrust was near the southern
flank of a 20-mile front where the
Communists have massed five or six
divisions, poised for a decisive at
tack on Taegu which may be timed
to coincide with the Korean inde
pendence day tomorrow.
To the south of the Taegu front
American troops were on the effen
| sive. Muddy Gl's crawled out of
I their fox holes at dawn today ta
attack in a driving rain against the
Naktong River bulge where na es
timated 10,000 Red troops have
crossed the river to threaten the
U.S. defense line.
In the far south the Americans
pressed their offensive toward
Chinju, although hampered by
Communists who had been by
passed by spearheads of the U.S.
| advance to the heights overlooking
! the southern Red base.
On the east coast the U.S. Air
Force was evacuating the Pohang
! airfield, although ground troops
| weer continuing to defend it in the
hope that American planes would
be able to use the field again later.
At the north end of the U.S. Nak
tong line, six miles northwest of
Waegwan, an American air attack
exploded a Communist ammunition
dump Sunday night. In this same
area the Air Force blasted 30 Red
artillery pieces late Sunday.
A big battle was reported under
way on the South Korean First Di
vision front 25 to 30 miles directly
north of Taegu, bu< no details were
available.
In a prelude to this morning's at
tack, Americans holding the line at
the Changnyong bridgehead hurled
back six enemy attacks Sunday.
They also moved in to wipe out a
pocket of 200 Communists who had
infiltrated to the rear of the U.S.
34th Regiment.
The Yongsan road block, which
had cut the main supply route from
Pusan to Taegu for two days, was
broken by troops of the 25th Infan
try Division who rushed in from the
southern front. In Yongsan, the
| Americans found a group of 75 U.S.
! troops, tired but still full of fight.
These Gl's had fought off hundreds
of North Koreans for two days ar.d
nights, killing an estimated 150 of
them.

charged across the Naktong River before daybreak today in an
assault apparently testing the American defenses preparatory to
a mass attack on Taegu by more than 50,000 Communist troops.
About 500 Red infantrymen made it across the river 14 miles

►southwest of Teagu, but they failed
to break through the U.S. First
Cavalry Division lines. The Com
munists struck at the same area of
the front where First Cavalry
troops have killed an estimated
1,000 Red infiltrators in the last two
days.
The thrust was near the southern
flank of a 20-mile front where the
Communists have massed five or six
divisions, poised for a decisive at
tack on Taegu which may be timed
to coincide with the Korean inde
pendence day tomorrow.
To the south of the Taegu front
American troops were on the effen
| sive. Muddy Gl's crawled out of
I their fox holes at dawn today ta
attack in a driving rain against the
Naktong River bulge where na es
timated 10,000 Red troops have
crossed the river to threaten the
U.S. defense line.
In the far south the Americans
pressed their offensive toward
Chinju, although hampered by
Communists who had been by
passed by spearheads of the U.S.
| advance to the heights overlooking
! the southern Red base.
On the east coast the U.S. Air
Force was evacuating the Pohang
! airfield, although ground troops
| weer continuing to defend it in the
hope that American planes would
be able to use the field again later.
At the north end of the U.S. Nak
tong line, six miles northwest of
Waegwan, an American air attack
exploded a Communist ammunition
dump Sunday night. In this same
area the Air Force blasted 30 Red
artillery pieces late Sunday.
A big battle was reported under
way on the South Korean First Di
vision front 25 to 30 miles directly
north of Taegu, bu< no details were
available.
In a prelude to this morning's at
tack, Americans holding the line at
the Changnyong bridgehead hurled
back six enemy attacks Sunday.
They also moved in to wipe out a
pocket of 200 Communists who had
infiltrated to the rear of the U.S.
34th Regiment.
The Yongsan road block, which
had cut the main supply route from
Pusan to Taegu for two days, was
broken by troops of the 25th Infan
try Division who rushed in from the
southern front. In Yongsan, the
| Americans found a group of 75 U.S.
! troops, tired but still full of fight.
These Gl's had fought off hundreds
of North Koreans for two days ar.d
nights, killing an estimated 150 of
them.
