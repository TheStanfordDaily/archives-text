POHANG AIR FIELD, Korea,
Aug. 13 (UP) — Air Force ground
crews and planes abandoned the
besieged Pohnag Air Field today
J and left a determined force of
! American Negro infantry, South
i Kcean infantry, and American
! tanks and artillery to keep it out .
I of Red hands.
By dusk, the evacuation —by |
South Korean LST's (Landing
Ships Tank) and C-47 transport
; planes—was all but complete. The
few Air Force men who remained
had last-minute odd jobs to do
and planned to get going in the
morning.
Maj. Ge"h- Earle E. Partridge,
commanding the Fifth Air Force,
ordered the evacuation. The deter- j
j mining reason was the reported ad- I
vance from the northwest of North
j Korean heavy artillery, which could
make the field untenable for planes. |
But the Air Force men—mechan
ics, armorers, clerks, and cooks—
| had been doing double duty day
: and night.
By day the Air Force men had
[ done their normal jobs. At night,
! they had joined the infantrymen in
! the fox holes of the defense perime
ter ready to help light off a possible
! night attack.
The troops who remain are de
termined to hold the field. They
believe they can do it, and stick on
here until pressure is relieved and
the air field—the best in South Ko
! rea—can be used again.
"My orders were to hold the
field." the commander of the
American til's said. "The orders
have not been changed."
South Korean infantrymen, led
by four American tanks, entered
Pohang today and moved three
miles north of it.
The little force met no enemy I
opposition on the way. They found I
many of the mud hut dwellings and j
the few modern buildings badly !
damaged by fire which had burned ,
for two days. Townspeople cheered
them.
