# Senator Accuses Truman of Concealing Korean War Facts From Public for 'Political Reasons'

### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 (UP) —
Sen. George D. Aiken, R., Vt., who
often votes with the administration,
accused President Truman today of
hiding the economic facts of the Ko
rean war from the public for "po
litical reasons."
Aiken, who said the President ap
parently is making decisions with
an eye to the November elections,
was backed by Sen. Edward P.
Martin, R., Pa., who also accused
the Democrats of giving "priority to
political considerations."
Aiken said the chief executive is
"minimizing" the sacrifices required
by the war and its companion re
armament program. The President,
he said, should make an immediate
"frank" public statement on what
may be ahead.
"We shouldn't try to sneak up on
full mobilization." he asserted. "We
ought to prepare now for the
won 1 :'"
Thy Jua' blast came as the Senate
prepared to resume debate tomor
row on its bill to arm the ihi.e£ ex,-

i ecutive with broad powers over the
nation's economy, including stand
by authority to impose price-wage
! rationing curbs.
Similar legislation already has
been passed by the House. Senate
Democratic leaders were hopeful it
would clear the upper chamber by
Friday with the help of Aiken and
other Republicans.
Another GOP bloc, headed by
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R., 0., opposes
the bill on grounds it goes too far,
but they were waging an apparently
hopeless battle. The Republican
policy committee will confer on the
issue Tuesday but a united party !
stand seemed out.
Republican Leader Kenneth S. j
Wherry, Neb., and Sen. Eugene D. |
Millikin. Colo., chairman of the
GOP policy commitee, agreed the
Senate would pass legislation along j
the lines of that approved by the j
House.
But they said they may support j
Taft's move to limit Mr. Truman's
I powers. 1


THE PRESIDENT
—Keepinsf secrets?
