# Men Inducted to Get Protection of Rights
## 
### 
Members of the National Guard,
reservists called to active duty, and
civilians called up for induction will
receive ihe same protection afforded
those called by the military during
World War 11.
This protection is afforded under
he terms of the Soldiers and Sailors
Civil Relief Act and the Selective
Service Act.
A further protection of rights for
hose whose studies under the GI
Bill are interrupted is provided.
This ruling is to the effect that
such persons will not be bound by
the Julv 25, 1950, cutoff date for
.starting courses. They will be per
mitted to resume studies "within a
reasonable period" following their j
release from latest service.
Employment rights will continue i
to be guaranteed under the Selec- '
live Service Act for honorably dis
charged v ?terans.
Most important to the many re
servists who are subject to call are |
the provisions of the civil relief act. |
This assures these men, many of |
whom aie veterans who returned to i
civilian life and undertook the nor

mal obligations cincident with es
tablishing their own homes, a pro
tection from mistreatment by credi
tors.
The act provides for moratoriums
on debts which the serviceman is
unable to pay by reason of his call
to military duty, permits stays on
mortgage foreclosures, evictions,
lease terminations, and tax sales.
It permits the termination of
leases by tenants if the premises
were leased for dwelling purposes
by a person who entered the service
after the lease execution.
Repossession provisions written
into conditional sales contracts,
which cover most furniture and ap
pliance purchases, may not be en
forced without court orders.
None of the provisions of the act
free the serviceman from his obli
gations, but establish rights to equi
table settlements and moratoriums.
Following the release of the indi
vidual from the service the usual
laws governing the various situa
tions take effect within periods
ranging from 60 days to six months.
