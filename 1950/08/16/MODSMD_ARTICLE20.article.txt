# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry
## 
### 
A couple of happy-go-lucky West Point graduates, Korea-bound,
dropped into my office yesterday in hopes of finding a free bottle of that
liquid stuff whose name you can't mention in The Stanford Daily. I told
them of Mrs. Stanford's dying wishes regarding the tangy stuff, and the
conversation drifted, as it always seems to do in my office, to football and
to the forthcoming Stanford-Army grid game to be played here next No
vember 18 —the week before the Big Game.
Lieutenants B.inkerholf and Lewis were simply bulging with information
about the healthy cadets, and also with a great deal of pardonable pride—
the Kavdets haven't lost a grid tilt since the Irish topped them in 1947. The
toys seem to think, as does everybody else follows the grid game to any
extent, that the Woo-Poo-on-thc-Hooers will have a very deadly aggrega -
tion come the fall-time.
Brinkerhoff: "The hottest back to hit the Point since Light Horse Harry
Wilson, in the mid-twenties, wlil be playing SECOND string for Army,
behind the sensational Gil Stephenson. I'm talking about A 1 Pollard, a
So Cal lad, who did a bit of burning up the prep ranks a year or so back.
Ninety per cent of the time that Pollard got the ball his plebe (last) year
he went for a touchdown. There was no stopping him. Other cozy offensive
b. cks include Jimmy Cain, Frankie Fischl, Bill Depew, Hal Schultz, and,
of course, at quarterback we'll have Bob Blaik, the coach's son, who has been
personally coached by All-American Arnold Galiffia. We've got some pretty
fair backs . . ."
Lewis: "Our best end next year will be Danny Foldberg, our next year's
team captain. Danny was All-American last year and will probably be
fairly effective next year. The other end will be a small 200-pounder named
Stone who stands around six and a half feet, except when he's after a pass
and then he gets taller. At center we have a 230-pounder named Chuck
Shira. He's only a little rougher than our classmate. Bill Yeoman, who
made All-American. We're strong at guard and tackle, so I guess we'll have
a pretty lair team next fall."
Feeling around the Point is that the Kaydets will eke out a small 34 to 0
win over the Cards next year, and the Bench feels that this, right now. is a
somewhat conservative estimate. Army, if they had a little tougher sched
ule. would probably be national champions next year. Stanford will have a
good club, but won't be that good.
For the record, Army plays Stanford, Michigan, Navy, Pennsylvania,
Penn State, Harvard, Colgate, New Mexico, and Columbia.
Whether or not the Stanford lambs are being led to the slaughter or
whether or not the Injuns will make mule juice, is somev/hat immaterial
and will be until 2 p.m. November 18; the important thing is that Stanford
is again playing the nation's best in a game that will receive national recog
nition. We are, indeed, playing a Big Time schedule. This, I hope, will more
than compensate for an uncomfortable 60 minutes come November.
Meanwhile, the Bench's very best wishes to Brink and Ben Lewis, who
will be very sorry to miss the big tilt. But they're heading for a game
bigger than even Notre Dame could give them. Keep your head down,
kids.

b. cks include Jimmy Cain, Frankie Fischl, Bill Depew, Hal Schultz, and,
of course, at quarterback we'll have Bob Blaik, the coach's son, who has been
personally coached by All-American Arnold Galiffia. We've got some pretty
fair backs . . ."
Lewis: "Our best end next year will be Danny Foldberg, our next year's
team captain. Danny was All-American last year and will probably be
fairly effective next year. The other end will be a small 200-pounder named
Stone who stands around six and a half feet, except when he's after a pass
and then he gets taller. At center we have a 230-pounder named Chuck
Shira. He's only a little rougher than our classmate. Bill Yeoman, who
made All-American. We're strong at guard and tackle, so I guess we'll have
a pretty lair team next fall."
Feeling around the Point is that the Kaydets will eke out a small 34 to 0
win over the Cards next year, and the Bench feels that this, right now. is a
somewhat conservative estimate. Army, if they had a little tougher sched
ule. would probably be national champions next year. Stanford will have a
good club, but won't be that good.
For the record, Army plays Stanford, Michigan, Navy, Pennsylvania,
Penn State, Harvard, Colgate, New Mexico, and Columbia.
Whether or not the Stanford lambs are being led to the slaughter or
whether or not the Injuns will make mule juice, is somev/hat immaterial
and will be until 2 p.m. November 18; the important thing is that Stanford
is again playing the nation's best in a game that will receive national recog
nition. We are, indeed, playing a Big Time schedule. This, I hope, will more
than compensate for an uncomfortable 60 minutes come November.
Meanwhile, the Bench's very best wishes to Brink and Ben Lewis, who
will be very sorry to miss the big tilt. But they're heading for a game
bigger than even Notre Dame could give them. Keep your head down,
kids.
A couple of happy-go-lucky West Point graduates, Korea-bound,
dropped into my office yesterday in hopes of finding a free bottle of that
liquid stuff whose name you can't mention in The Stanford Daily. I told
them of Mrs. Stanford's dying wishes regarding the tangy stuff, and the
conversation drifted, as it always seems to do in my office, to football and
to the forthcoming Stanford-Army grid game to be played here next No
vember 18 —the week before the Big Game.
Lieutenants B.inkerholf and Lewis were simply bulging with information
about the healthy cadets, and also with a great deal of pardonable pride—
the Kavdets haven't lost a grid tilt since the Irish topped them in 1947. The
toys seem to think, as does everybody else follows the grid game to any
extent, that the Woo-Poo-on-thc-Hooers will have a very deadly aggrega -
tion come the fall-time.
Brinkerhoff: "The hottest back to hit the Point since Light Horse Harry
Wilson, in the mid-twenties, wlil be playing SECOND string for Army,
behind the sensational Gil Stephenson. I'm talking about A 1 Pollard, a
So Cal lad, who did a bit of burning up the prep ranks a year or so back.
Ninety per cent of the time that Pollard got the ball his plebe (last) year
he went for a touchdown. There was no stopping him. Other cozy offensive
