## 
### 
BUFFALO, N.Y., Aug. 15 (UP)—
Ezzard Charles made an unim
pressive and unpopular return to
the ring tonight as he kept his NBA
heavyweight crown by scoring a
technical knockout over battered
and bloodied Freddy Beshore at
2:53 of the 14th round in Memorial
Auditorium.
The small crowd, estimated at
7,000, booed Charles and Referee
Barney Felix lustily when Felix
stopped the bout because he re
garded Beshore's swollen right ear
as in a dangerous condition. The
car was so badly puffed that it ap

peared like a huge purplish bulb
attached to blond Freddie's head.
Charles, fighting for the first time
since last October, failed to score a
single knockdown against his awk
ward, light-punching opponent. He
did, however, have the challenger
from Harrisburg, Pa., "out on his
feet" on at least four occasions.
At the end of the seventh round,
Dr. Lois A. Kaiser stepped into the
| corner to examine Fr<iddy's bat
tered features. The challenger al
| ready was bleeding badly from the
nose, mouth, and a gash over his left
brow.
