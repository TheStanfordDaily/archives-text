# Rail Unions Ask President To Stop Strike
## 
### 
Two big rail unions yesterday
asked the White House to avert a
threatened nationwide rail strike in
the day's major labor development.
At Detroit, the CIO United Auto
Workers shut down Packard Motor
Car Co. in a strike.
The presidents of unions repre
senting 300,000 railroad trainmen
and conductors, acting after a last
ditch conference collapsed, asked
President Truman to seize the rail
roads to head off a walkout.
W. Park Kennedy of the train
men and Roy O. Hughes of the con
ductors said they saw "no point" in
continuing talks with carrier rep
resentatives presided over By Presi
dential Assistant John R. Steelman.
They accused the carriers of a
"defiant, high-handed attitude" in
a wage and hour dispute. The un
ions legally are free to strike.
The White House, in announcing
failure of the talks, said earlier that
both sides agreed to resume con
ferences only if Steelman "can find
a basis for negotiations."
The unions could call a nation
wide strike, or they could select a
few roads or portions of roads, a
pattern followed in two recent rail
strikes to avoid creating a national
emergency.
The full policy committees of
both rail unions were in session in
Washington. They were reported
ready to take immediate strike ac
tion if the negotiations fail.
There was no indication from the
White House when Steelman might
recall the negotiators.
