TOKYO, Wednesday, Aug. 16 (UP) —Commu-
nist troops armed with automatic weapons and
mortars captured a mountain today on the east
side of the Naktong River only nine miles from
Taegu, emergency South Korean capital and

American supply base.
Slipping thruough the American
defenses northwest of Taegu before
daybreak, the North Koreans
reached the top of the 1,000-foot
mountain where they dug in and
beat back U.S attempts to rout
them.
An Fighth Army spokesman said
that to the south in the Changnyong
bulge, American lines held firm
throughout the night and this
morning against Communist stabs
at the arc of their bridgehead,
which was described officially as
being 2.7 miles deep and five miles
long at its points of greatest depth
and length.
A front dispatch from United
Press correspondent Rutherford
Poats said a First Cavalry spokes
man estimated that the Communist
mountian-top force was less than a
regiment—about 3.000 men.
From their lofty positions the
Reds were almost within sight of
Taegu, nine miles to the southeast.
A First Cavalry Division spokes
man said most of the Communist
troops apparently filtered south
from a North Korean bridgehead
eight miles above Waegwan. al
though some may have made a di
rect river crossing during the night.
A week ago the First Cavalry
troops reported they had moppe '
up a force of two companies on the
same mountain.
