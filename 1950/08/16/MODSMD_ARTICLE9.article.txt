## A 						Stanford Inn 
### 
Streamlined classrooms, modern laboratories, two restaurants,
two soda bars, several stores —the Stanford campus has them all,
but no hotel.
True, there are a couple of rooms in the Women's Clubhouse
visitors can stay and the new student union is supposed to
have a couple of guest rooms, but there's no real hotel on campus—
a hotel run by the University for the benefit and convenience of
visiting professors, speakers, and other distinguished guests.
Because of this deficiency, many visitors are forced to stay in
Palo Alto or even San Francisco. Even worse, Stanford professors,
especially department heads, are burdened yearly with literally
nundreds of guests —guests they must house and feed out of their
Dwn meager salaries.
One professor spent close to half his yearly pay housing and
teoding visiting men in his department. Another was forced to rent
one of the fraternity houses this summer to take care of the tre
mendous number of guests who descended on him from other uni
versities ail over the world.
if Stanford were lo maintain some sort of an inn, it would not
only take this load of the professors, but it would also provide a
clean, comfortable place for visitors to rest, wash up, and maybe
stay a few days.
\he cost oi such an establishment would not be exorbitant. A
nominal fee could be charged every guest, a trust fund might be
set up to take care of yearly fixed costs, or surpluses from the
Union might be used to pay the bills.
Furthermore, students could be hired to work in the hotel, help
ing to relieve the ever present demand for more student jobs.
No matter how it is done, the idea is a feasible one—an idea that
should be carefully considered now that the University is setting
up a long-range plan for future development. An existing building
might be converted, or a new hall built—that problem is up to the
designers. But plans ought to be made immediately for a campus
hotel to complete the reguirements of a busy college community in
the years to come.
