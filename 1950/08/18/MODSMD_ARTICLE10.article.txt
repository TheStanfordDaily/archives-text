# Dressing Rooms, Too

### 
To the Editor:
We were very much interested in your editorial Wednesday about a hotel
on campus, but as far as we are concerned, there is a much more serious
need than just housing speakers and visiting faculty members. Several times,
groups of us have invited boys down to Stanford from Cal and other colleges
for a football game and a dance in the evening, to find to our utter dismay
that there was no place for the visitors to change their clothes after the
game. Were a hotel to be built on campus, it would be a real benefit to the
student body if rooms were set up to take care of this problem.
