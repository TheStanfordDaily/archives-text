The San Francisco Repertory
Theater is looking for additional
talent to increase the present com
pany for its fall and winter produc
tion schedule.
Professionals as well as amateurs
interested in joining the company
are urged to contact producer-di
rector Robert T. Eley for interviews
now as plans are under way to start
rehearsals within a week.
The Repertory's fall-winter sea
son starts September 12 with Moss
Hart's "Light Up the Sky," followed
by Mary Bayley Bell's "Duet for
Two Hands," Dalton Trumbo's "The
Biggest Thief in Town," Maxwell
Anderson's "Anne of the Thousand
Days," two weeks of "Rumple Stilt
skin" for children during the
Christmas holidays, Elmer Rice's
classic "Street Scene," and Anita
Loos' "Happy Birthday."
The Repertory company, San
Francisco's only resident profes
sional theatrical group, consists of
both salaried actors and actresses
on minimum Equity contracts, and
apprentices who act and work tech
nically in exchange for dramatic
training in regular class sessions.
Appointments for interviews may
be made by calling Miss Frances
O'Farrell, secretary to the Director.
