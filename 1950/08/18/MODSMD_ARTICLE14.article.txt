## 
### 
SAN FPiANCISCO, Aug. 17 (UP)
—The Veterans Administration de
mand that funds paid by it into stu
dent athletic organizations the past
four years must be returned, could
break every college athletic unit in
the country, Brutus Hamilton, di
rector of athletics at the University
of California, said today.
The government has declared that
the voluntary payment out of ad
ministration funds for athletic cards
in the past has been illegal and
wants colleges to return the money.
"Such a decision would cost the
University of California Associated
Students organization $400,000," said
Hamilton. "And we just haven't
got it. Most moneys received from
veterans for student body athletic
cards in all colleges have been
spent.
"Our only alternative would be
to deed to the government the new
seats we have built in our stadium
with this money."
Hamilton said he was not "too
worried" about the situation.

"We've checked over the ruling
from the Veterans Administration
and we can't see how they can make j
the order retroactive," he said.
He was quick to point out that
the ruling affected only those col
leges where purchase of a student
body card was not compulsory.
"Many schools include the cost of
that card in their entry fees," Ham
ilton said, "and the government had
to pay for that to get the student
into the college. However, at the
University of California and many
other schools, purchase of the card
is on a voluntary basis,"
San Francisco State, a compara
tively small state college in San
Francisco, stands to lose about
$100,000 in refunds.
"It is a very unfair ruling," said
President Paul Leonard. "Anyway,
I don't see what we can do. The
money already has been spent."
