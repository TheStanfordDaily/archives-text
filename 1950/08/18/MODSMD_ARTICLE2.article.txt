# MacArthur Urges UN to Rush Organized Troops to Korea
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y., Aug. 17 j
(UP) â€”Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur
urged United Nations members to
day to rush already - orgnaized j
ground units to Korea as the United
States challenged Russia to "for- j
sake suspicion" and "join in a frank |
and free exchange" of peace propo
sals.
American Delegate Warren R.
Austin told the Council that Rus
sia ""can have peace" and "can end
the fighting" if it so desires.
Mac Arthur, in his second report i
to the Security Council, said organ- I
izecl ground units were needed at
once in.order to bring swift defeat
of the ReH invaders.
The UN's supreme commander ;
hailed recent offers of other nations j
to send reinforcements to help
United States and South Korean
troops. But he pointed out that none
had arrived on the scene yet, and
appealed to UN members to dis
patch existing outfits rather than
settle for training new units that j
could not get into the battle for
weeks or months.
Austin, who sent Mac Arthur's re- J
port to the Council, told today's !
session that the UN's aim in the |
Korean campaign must be a free I
and unified country.
"The UN must see that the people
of Korea attain complete individual j
and political freedom," he said.
"Korea's prospects would be j
dark if any action of the UN were 1
to condemn it to exist indefinitely
as 'half slave and half free,' or even
one - third slave and two - thirds
free."
Thus, the United States appar

ently ruled out any return to the
split Korea that existed before
the Northern Communists poured
across the 38th parallel June 25.
j The phrase -"one-third slave and
j two - thirds free" referred to the
pre-invasion set-up in which one
third of the population lived in the
I Soviet - dominated Northern sector

and two - thirds lived under the
UN-recognized South Korean re
public.
It was the ninth Council meeting
under the presidency of Soviet
Delegate Jacob A. Malik, who end
ed Russia's 29-week boycott on the
China issue August 1 to take over
Russia's regular turn in the chair.
There was quite a commotion for
a few hours here after it was
learned that Malik had summoned
his Council colleagues to a secret
session an hour before the start of
the regular meeting.
But the session proved a dud.
Delegates said all Malik did was re
peat the Soviet stand on the proce
dural wrangle by which he has sty
mied concrete Korean work since
the return of the Russians. He
wants the North Koreans invited to
state their case or he won't invite
the South Koreans to the table.
