WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (UP) —
President Truman today denounced
as "contemptible" a statement by
Sen. Kenneth Wherry, R., Nebr.,
[ that the blood of our soldiers in Ko
| rea rests on the shoulders of Sec
j retary of State Dean Acheson.
The President was asked about
j Wherry's statement at his news
I conference.
Obvioulsy angered by the attack
on his Secretary of State, Mr. Tru
{ man took the unusual step of per
j mitting direct quotation and then
I said:
"It was a contemptible statement
j and beneath comment."
Wherry said during a heated Sen
ate debate last Monday that Ache
son should be fired as a blunderer
] and that the Secretary is respon
sible for the American lives lost in
Korea.
He went on to demand that Pres
ident Truman "get rid of the alien
minded radicals and moral per
verts in his administration."
Meanwhile, Sen. Alexander Wi
ley, R., Wis., a member of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee,
warned that the United States
"hovers at the brink of military
disaster" because of the imminent
danger of becoming involved in an
endless battle with 400,000.000 Red
Chinese."
He added that he has asked the
administration for a report on how
it intends to prevent the "complete
debacle" which would result if Rus
sia were to order the Chinese Com
munist troops into the Korean war. [
In the House, Rep. Robert L.
Sikes, D„ Fla., said the top mili
tary leaders in Korea should be re
placed. While he named no names, j
he obviously referred to Gen. Doug
las Mac Arthur, who is directing the
fight against the Red invaders.
