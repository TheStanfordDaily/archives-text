WITH U.S. FIRST CAVALRY,
Korea, Aug. 17 —Thirty-two Amer
ican prisoners with hands tied be
hind their backs were shot dead to
day by Red Koreans on a hill west
of Waegwan just before a U.S. pa
trol reached the spot.
The Reds tried to kill 37 prisoners
in all. But five lived to tell the
story. They said the Communists
also massacred the wounded as they
lay moaning on the ground.
This was in the area that was
bombed yesterday by 98 B-29's in
the heaviest air raid of the war.
Killing of prisoners in this fashion
is typical retaliation for such an
assault.
The execution of the prisoners
was on hill 303, which was captured
by the Reds this morning.
Their bodies were found on a
ridge recaptured by the Fifth Cav
alry this afternoon. The American
prisoners were killed only two
hours before troopers re-took the
ridge.
The Americans seized the ridge
at 6:30 p.m. (5:30 a.m. PDT). The
hill had been fought over for three
days.
The 37 Americans were mowed
down by bursts of gunfire.
Three North Korean prisoners
were taken after a sharp fire fight
near by. One of them was positive
ly identified by an American sur
vivor—Cpl. James Melvin Rudd of
Salyersville, Ky.—as a member of
the squad of killers.
This prisoner denied he had taken
any part in the action. Regimental
officers said he would be sent back
with recommendation that he be
tried as a war criminal.
