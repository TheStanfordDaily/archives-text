dent Truman today all but ruled

Defense Secretary Louis Johnson

asked Congress Wednesday for im
mediate passage of a standby UMT
program for 17-year-olds. It would
be put into effect by the President
whenever he believed it was
needed.
But Mr. Truman explained at a
news conference that he, person
ally, had not asked for UMT at this
session of Congress because he does

not want to start a Congressional
battle that might delay his more
urgent Korean war program.

WASHINGTON — Two railroad
unions called their second strike in
24 hours today, but President Tru
man voiced hope their dispute will
be settled before it explodes into a
nationwide walkout.

The new strike was called by the

and the Order of Railway Conduc
tors against the Elgin, Joliet and
Eastern Railroad of Chicago and
the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Rail
road of Pittsburgh.
Some 5,000 yardmen and train
emoloyees were ordered to start a

men are due to walk off the job at
terminals in three other cities.

animously passed and sent to the
White House today a "milestone
bill" bringing 10,000,000 Americans
under Social Security for the first
time and nearly doubling the
monthly benefits for retired work-

The first major overhaul of the
Social Security program in 15 years |
received final approval by voice j
vote with little debate and no op- I
position. The House passed the bi- j
partisan bill Wednesday by a vote
of 374 to 1.
