# Taegu Ordered Evacuated; Major Battle Under Way
## 
### 
TOKYO, Friday, Aug. 18 (UP) —The South Korean government
ordered the evacuation of Taegu today as artillery shells crashed
into the city and Communist troops threatened it from the north.
The 800,000 people in the emergency South Korean capital Ls
gan streaming out of the city.
As they fled, the battle which may determine Taegu's fate raged

12 miles to the north of Kunwha.
From the provisional capital—its
population swollen by thousands of
refugees from the north—the people
plodded southward. Some rode on
bikes and some had ancient carts,
but most trudged along under the
burning sun.
The columns that choked the
highways to the south and south
east included old men with pack
boards on their backs, women with
their babies slung in bundles on
their backs, and barefooted chil
dren.
In the desperate battle for the
city being waged over the moun
tains to the north, the South Ko
reans had launched a counterattack
in the slim hope of driving back the
30,000 North Korean invaders.
Only two South Korean divisions
were between the Communists and
Taegu on the northern front be
cause the Americans were tied up
elsewhere. In the Naktong River
bulge 25 miles southwest of Taegu
the Marines and 24th Infantry Di
sion troops were off on the second
day of their attempt to eliminate
the Red bridgehead.
At 11:30 a.m., a front dispatch
from United Pi ess correspondent
Robert Miller said that all the
American units were advancing
"according to schedule" and wera
taking prisoners.
Before the second day of the
Changnyong bulge offensive was
started the Marines had to fight off
a Communist counterattack which
gained 100 yards before the leather
necks threw the enemy back. Then
they drove ahead to recapture the
high ground they had won yester
day.
By 8 a.m. the Marines and troops
of the 24th Infantry Division had
launched the second phase of the
attack, with the leathernecks driv
ing from the south and the 24th Di
vision punching the Communists
from the northeast.
Artillery duels lasted throughout
the night with the Communists fir
ing from both inside and outsida
the bulge.
An Eighth Army communique
this morning said the main threat
to the United Nations defense line
"remains the massed Communist
divisions between Waegwan and
Kunwi where the enemy yesterday
made several attacks." The U.S. Air
Force sought to meet this threat by
bombing and strafing the Reds fac
ing Taegu on the north.
