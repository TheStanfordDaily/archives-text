With the rapidly changing war-time conditions, the University
found that its old system of handling degrees and transcripts is too
slow and thus they have taken steps to speed up the whole proce
dure.
At the moment, it takes a week to ten days to obtain an official
transcript, but Dean Winbigler is now working on a speed-up
priority system so that those who need a transcript in a hurry for
the Army or graduate school, may get one almost over night.
Also, at the end of summer guarter, it usually takes a long time
for the University to issue completed degrees to graduating sen
iors. For instance, the Academic Council this year is not planning
to meet until September 29, and no degree can be conferred with
out the approval of this council. After this degree is conferred,
it will take another ten days for the degree to be recorded on the
student's transcript and a photostat made.
To remedy this time lag, the following system has been set up
for graduating students who want some sort of evidence to prove
that they are planning to get their degrees at the end of the guarter:
1. The major department secretary will issue a statement that all
work in the major field has been completed.
2. This should be taken to the recorder who will certify that all
University reguirements have been met.
3. The complete statement should then be given to the registrar
who will draw up a statement saying that the student will receive
a degree at the end of the guarter providing that he passes all his
courses.
Although this is not exactly the same as having a degree in hand,
it still is proof that a degree is forthcoming—proof that will be ac
cepted by most employers and graduate schools. Whether the
Army OCS will accept such a statement has yet to be seen.
Up until now, the recorder's office has been slow in filling re
quests for student s. However, they did not know the situation that
existed, and now that they have seen how important it is that tran
scripts and degrees be furnished in a hurry, they are making rapid
strides to correct the situation.
