## The 						Union "Hotel" 
### 
To the Editor:
Your editorial "A Stanford Inn" in today's Daily is very interesting, but
did you know that the Union residence, as originally intended, was built for
visiting alumni, professors, guests, and friends, just as you suggest for your
proposed inn?
The source of this piece of information was a letter to the editor in The
Daily a year or two ago. If the memory of the writer has not faltered over
the past two years, and if the purpose of the Union originally was as men
tioned above, then it seems likely that a similar thing might again happen—
that the University officials might decide that student housing is more im
portant. than courtesy to alumni and visiting professors.
