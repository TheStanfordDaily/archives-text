When Shakespeare calls, Stan- |
ford answers!
Something of a minor migration
in the name of theatrical experi
ence is taking place this week
under the banner of Dr. Margery
Bailey, associate professor of Eng
lish at Stanford.
Dr. Bailey, who recently acted
the role of Hecuba in the Hillbarn
production of Euripides' "The Tro
jan Women," is the center of a
group of local drama enthusiasts
who traveled last weekend to Ash
land, Ore., to attend the month-long
Shakespearean Festival.
Among Stanford students and
alumni accompanying Dr. Bailey ,
are Myna Brunton Hughes and
Grace Margaret Webster of San
Francisco, Norma Lee of Utah, and
Miliaria Drachman of Stanford.
At Ashland the Stanford gruop j
will assemble with others from the j
Palo Alto area including Mrs. How
ard Halbert, Selly Halbert, Rose
mary Boezinger, Don Sobieske.
James Jackman, and Stephen
Morse, of Yale.
The Ashland Festival is under
the general supervision of Angus
Lowmer, a former student of 'Miss
Bailey. It was Bowmer who estab
lished the yearly cycle of Shake
speare plays at Ashland in 1935, and
the fame of the festival has brought
to ii sponsors, including Governor
Earl Warren and Bing Crosby.
Four plays—"Antony and Cleo- I

patra," "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," "As You Like It,"and
"Henry IV," Part I—are being pre
sented each week throughout Au
gust on Ashland's authentic Eliza
bethan stage.
Other students and former stu
dents of Miss Bailey who are tak
ing part in this year's festival are
Curt Zimansky of the University
of lowa, James Sandoe of the Uni
versity of Colorado, and Allen
Fletcher of Purdue, each directing
a play, and the following actors:

Jane Mc Arthur, Ann Guilbert
Anne Lawder, Robert Scothorn,
Carol Eller, and Douglas Russell.
Dr. Bailey is also preparing, as
proctor of the Dramatists' Alli
ance, for the annual assembly day
to be held at the Palo Alto Commu
nity Center Saturday. Authors, di
rectors, critics, and audiences from
throughout California will gather
to hear first-hand accounts of Eu
ropean theater by the Pilares
brothers of Oakland and James
Clancey of San Jose.
