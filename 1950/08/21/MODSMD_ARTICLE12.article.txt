# Redskins Humiliate San Francisco '49ers 31-12 Before 55,000 Opening Day Fans
## 
### AL BERRY Daily Sports Editor 
KEZAR STADIUM, Aug. 20.—There was a cold, sunless sky over
San Francisco today and Slinging Sammy Baugh did little to
brighten it up for the 55,000 shivering grid fans who sat quietly
by and watched the Washington Reskins pummel, tromp on and
thunder over Buck Shaw's hapless band of San Francisco 49ers,

31 to 12. The game, unfortunately,
wasn't as close as the score indi
cates.
The highly heralded match be
tween Baugh and the '49er wizard
Stanfordman Frank C. Albert did
n't turn out to be much of a tussle,
as Albert had one of his worse days I
and Baugh, with 14 years of pro
practice behind him, was magnifi- :
cent as he effortlessly guided his |
blue-shirted Redskins to an easy
win. The hoped-for battle between 1
COP's little Eddie Leßaron and the !
Berkeley counterpart. Reckless |
Robert C°leri, never came off at all. j
Leßaron got in the fray only to
punt twice and to manage the team j
in the last four minutes of the al- j
ready-won fracas. The wiser Ce
leri remained safely on the bench
and, we assume, rooted strongly for
the losers.
The scoring ice was dented but
once in the first 30 minutes of |
floundering around the turf when. |
in the second play of the game, Hall j
Haynes, who played a fine game for |
the visitors on defense, intercepted I
a Frankie Albert pass and thus set !
up a 12-yard field goal, ably booted j
by Virginia's Bill Dudley. The lads
went in for their half - time re
freshments with the scoreboard
reading 3-0. and the patrons begin
ning to yawn just a little bit.
The '49ers got their biggest break
on the first play fo the third quar
ter. after the Redskins had decided
to let Norm Standlee's kick-off roll
dead in the end zone. Baugh was j
evidently trying to find some oblig- I
ing back to hand the ball to, when
he was bounced from behind by
270 pounds of Leo Nomellini. The
fumble was recovered by '49er
tackel Bruno Banducci on the Red- j
skins' 19-yard line.
Quarterback Frankie Albert took
it easy going after the first '49er,
tally. Joe Perry went over tackle j
ior 8, Strzykalski went for nowhere. '
and Perry picked up 12 inches. Al- j
bert, himself, took the first down
on a quarterback sneak to the |
Washington 9. Albert to Beals was ,
incomplete, then Joe Perry went to j
the 6. Apparently tired of this fool- ]

j ing around, on third down Albert
i pitched a perfect strike between the i
goal posts to end Hal Shoener. Her
i man Wedemyer didn't come vaguely
■ close to kicking the after-point, and
the '49ers led for the first and only
time, 6-3.
Being scored on seemed to annoy
. the Washington team in general and i
Mr. Baugh in particular. Three
minutes after Albert's touchdown
pass, Baugh was near mid - field
fading rapidly toward the sidelines
with most of the '49er team baying
| at his heels, when he spotted the
six - foot four - inch frame of end
| Hugh Taylor standing unchaper- |
oned 40-some-odd yards away. The !
pass was nicely executed on the }
run, and after Dudley's conversion
! the score was 10 to 6. San Fran
cisco, neither figuratively nor lit- j
erally, saw daylight again.
With 15 seconds left in the third ,
stanza, Baugh uncorked again, this j
. time to end Clyde Goodnight, who :
happened to be standing in the '49er j
end zone when he caught the bal .
The fourth quarter started with
j the Associated scoreboard reading
Washington 17, San Francisco 6.
O'd pro Baugh, evidently feeling
it unfair to keep scoring via the
airways, piddled around for five
minutes and then, much to the un
happiness of most concerned, sent a j
timid, 223-pound, 6-foot-4 fullback
named Rob Goode 32 yards up the
'49er middle for the Redskins' third
TD of the long afternoon. After
holding the ball for Dudley's in
fallible al'terpoint, Baugh left the
game in favor of little Eddie Le-
Baron.
But the San Franicsco Albertites
hadn't died completely. They
bounced back with Albert's 35-yard
pass tc Wedemeyer who was
brought dc vn from behind on the
Redskin 15. Albert flipped his sec
j ond, and last, point-maker to Don
Garlin. The score at this point was
24 to 12, and the patrons were be-
I ginning to file homeward.
But Eddie Leßaron hadn't had his
! say yet. He had it with 90 seconds
j left to play as the tiring Shawmen

watched him pitch a 31-yard bingo
to halfback George Thomas. Dud
ley's conversion was, of course,
quite good.
The gun ended the slaughter with
the Redskins wondering if they
should score again, and the '49ers
wondering just what terrible things
the world champion Philadelphia
Eagles would have in store for them
next week.
The offensive was, throughout the
tilt, strictly in the possession of the
visitors in the guise of the Texan
named Baugh. If it hadn't been for
the grace of God, Frank Albert, and
a linebacker named Wismann, the
'49ers might have been humiliated
more than they were. But it is still
early in the season and this blooper
was, after all, a charity tilt. The
Redskins had two games under
their belts, and the '49ers were
playing their first. They looked it.
Next week: The Eagles.

COP's little Eddie Leßaron and the !
Berkeley counterpart. Reckless |

Leßaron got in the fray only to
punt twice and to manage the team j
in the last four minutes of the al- j
ready-won fracas. The wiser Ce
leri remained safely on the bench
and, we assume, rooted strongly for
the losers.
The scoring ice was dented but
once in the first 30 minutes of |
floundering around the turf when. |
in the second play of the game, Hall j
Haynes, who played a fine game for |
the visitors on defense, intercepted I
a Frankie Albert pass and thus set !
up a 12-yard field goal, ably booted j
by Virginia's Bill Dudley. The lads
went in for their half - time re
freshments with the scoreboard
reading 3-0. and the patrons begin
ning to yawn just a little bit.
The '49ers got their biggest break
on the first play fo the third quar
ter. after the Redskins had decided
to let Norm Standlee's kick-off roll
dead in the end zone. Baugh was j
evidently trying to find some oblig- I
ing back to hand the ball to, when
he was bounced from behind by
270 pounds of Leo Nomellini. The
fumble was recovered by '49er
tackel Bruno Banducci on the Red- j
skins' 19-yard line.
Quarterback Frankie Albert took
it easy going after the first '49er,
tally. Joe Perry went over tackle j
ior 8, Strzykalski went for nowhere. '
and Perry picked up 12 inches. Al- j
bert, himself, took the first down
on a quarterback sneak to the |
Washington 9. Albert to Beals was ,
incomplete, then Joe Perry went to j
the 6. Apparently tired of this fool- ]

j ing around, on third down Albert
i pitched a perfect strike between the i
goal posts to end Hal Shoener. Her
i man Wedemyer didn't come vaguely
■ close to kicking the after-point, and
the '49ers led for the first and only
time, 6-3.
Being scored on seemed to annoy
. the Washington team in general and i
Mr. Baugh in particular. Three
minutes after Albert's touchdown
pass, Baugh was near mid - field
fading rapidly toward the sidelines
with most of the '49er team baying
| at his heels, when he spotted the
six - foot four - inch frame of end
| Hugh Taylor standing unchaper- |
oned 40-some-odd yards away. The !
pass was nicely executed on the }
run, and after Dudley's conversion
! the score was 10 to 6. San Fran
cisco, neither figuratively nor lit- j
erally, saw daylight again.
With 15 seconds left in the third ,
stanza, Baugh uncorked again, this j
. time to end Clyde Goodnight, who :
happened to be standing in the '49er j
end zone when he caught the bal .
The fourth quarter started with
j the Associated scoreboard reading
Washington 17, San Francisco 6.
O'd pro Baugh, evidently feeling
it unfair to keep scoring via the
airways, piddled around for five
minutes and then, much to the un
happiness of most concerned, sent a j
timid, 223-pound, 6-foot-4 fullback
named Rob Goode 32 yards up the
'49er middle for the Redskins' third
TD of the long afternoon. After
holding the ball for Dudley's in
fallible al'terpoint, Baugh left the
game in favor of little Eddie Le-
Baron.
But the San Franicsco Albertites
hadn't died completely. They
bounced back with Albert's 35-yard
pass tc Wedemeyer who was
brought dc vn from behind on the
Redskin 15. Albert flipped his sec
j ond, and last, point-maker to Don
Garlin. The score at this point was
24 to 12, and the patrons were be-
I ginning to file homeward.
But Eddie Leßaron hadn't had his
! say yet. He had it with 90 seconds
j left to play as the tiring Shawmen

watched him pitch a 31-yard bingo
to halfback George Thomas. Dud
ley's conversion was, of course,
quite good.
The gun ended the slaughter with
the Redskins wondering if they
should score again, and the '49ers
wondering just what terrible things
the world champion Philadelphia
Eagles would have in store for them
next week.
The offensive was, throughout the
tilt, strictly in the possession of the
visitors in the guise of the Texan
named Baugh. If it hadn't been for
the grace of God, Frank Albert, and
a linebacker named Wismann, the
'49ers might have been humiliated
more than they were. But it is still
early in the season and this blooper
was, after all, a charity tilt. The
Redskins had two games under

playing their first. They looked it.

ter. after the Redskins had decided
to let Norm Standlee's kick-off roll
dead in the end zone. Baugh was j
evidently trying to find some oblig- I
ing back to hand the ball to, when
he was bounced from behind by
270 pounds of Leo Nomellini. The
fumble was recovered by '49er
tackel Bruno Banducci on the Red- j
skins' 19-yard line.
Quarterback Frankie Albert took
it easy going after the first '49er,
tally. Joe Perry went over tackle j
ior 8, Strzykalski went for nowhere. '
and Perry picked up 12 inches. Al- j
bert, himself, took the first down
on a quarterback sneak to the |
Washington 9. Albert to Beals was ,
incomplete, then Joe Perry went to j
the 6. Apparently tired of this fool- ]

j ing around, on third down Albert
i pitched a perfect strike between the i
goal posts to end Hal Shoener. Her
i man Wedemyer didn't come vaguely
■ close to kicking the after-point, and
the '49ers led for the first and only
time, 6-3.
Being scored on seemed to annoy
. the Washington team in general and i
Mr. Baugh in particular. Three
minutes after Albert's touchdown
pass, Baugh was near mid - field
fading rapidly toward the sidelines
with most of the '49er team baying
| at his heels, when he spotted the
six - foot four - inch frame of end
| Hugh Taylor standing unchaper- |
oned 40-some-odd yards away. The !
pass was nicely executed on the }
run, and after Dudley's conversion
! the score was 10 to 6. San Fran
cisco, neither figuratively nor lit- j
erally, saw daylight again.
With 15 seconds left in the third ,
stanza, Baugh uncorked again, this j
. time to end Clyde Goodnight, who :
happened to be standing in the '49er j
end zone when he caught the bal .
The fourth quarter started with
j the Associated scoreboard reading
Washington 17, San Francisco 6.
O'd pro Baugh, evidently feeling
it unfair to keep scoring via the
airways, piddled around for five
minutes and then, much to the un
happiness of most concerned, sent a j
timid, 223-pound, 6-foot-4 fullback
named Rob Goode 32 yards up the
'49er middle for the Redskins' third
TD of the long afternoon. After
holding the ball for Dudley's in
fallible al'terpoint, Baugh left the
game in favor of little Eddie Le-
Baron.
But the San Franicsco Albertites
hadn't died completely. They
bounced back with Albert's 35-yard
pass tc Wedemeyer who was
brought dc vn from behind on the
Redskin 15. Albert flipped his sec
j ond, and last, point-maker to Don
Garlin. The score at this point was
24 to 12, and the patrons were be-
I ginning to file homeward.
But Eddie Leßaron hadn't had his
! say yet. He had it with 90 seconds
j left to play as the tiring Shawmen

watched him pitch a 31-yard bingo
to halfback George Thomas. Dud
ley's conversion was, of course,
quite good.
The gun ended the slaughter with
the Redskins wondering if they
should score again, and the '49ers
wondering just what terrible things
the world champion Philadelphia
Eagles would have in store for them
next week.
The offensive was, throughout the
tilt, strictly in the possession of the
visitors in the guise of the Texan
named Baugh. If it hadn't been for
the grace of God, Frank Albert, and
a linebacker named Wismann, the
'49ers might have been humiliated
more than they were. But it is still
early in the season and this blooper
was, after all, a charity tilt. The
Redskins had two games under
their belts, and the '49ers were
playing their first. They looked it.
Next week: The Eagles.


FRAHiLL ALBERT
—A very bad day
KEZAR STADIUM, Aug. 20.—There was a cold, sunless sky over
San Francisco today and Slinging Sammy Baugh did little to
brighten it up for the 55,000 shivering grid fans who sat quietly
by and watched the Washington Reskins pummel, tromp on and
thunder over Buck Shaw's hapless band of San Francisco 49ers,

31 to 12. The game, unfortunately,
wasn't as close as the score indi
cates.
The highly heralded match be
tween Baugh and the '49er wizard
Stanfordman Frank C. Albert did
n't turn out to be much of a tussle,
as Albert had one of his worse days I
and Baugh, with 14 years of pro
practice behind him, was magnifi- :
cent as he effortlessly guided his |
blue-shirted Redskins to an easy
win. The hoped-for battle between 1
COP's little Eddie Leßaron and the !
Berkeley counterpart. Reckless |
Robert C°leri, never came off at all. j
Leßaron got in the fray only to
punt twice and to manage the team j
in the last four minutes of the al- j
ready-won fracas. The wiser Ce
leri remained safely on the bench
and, we assume, rooted strongly for
the losers.
The scoring ice was dented but
once in the first 30 minutes of |
floundering around the turf when. |
in the second play of the game, Hall j
Haynes, who played a fine game for |
the visitors on defense, intercepted I
a Frankie Albert pass and thus set !
up a 12-yard field goal, ably booted j
by Virginia's Bill Dudley. The lads
went in for their half - time re
freshments with the scoreboard
reading 3-0. and the patrons begin
