# Yanks Move Into Second As DiMaggio Blasts A's
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Aug. 20. (UP) —Low-rank lightning struck in De
troit and Cleveland today, enabling the New York Yankees to
move into second place in the American League by sweeping their
doubleheader at Philadelphia, 6 to 4 and 5 to 2.
W) : le the Yanks were charging to within three games of the

top, the front-running Detroit Ti- j
gers won the first game of a twin I
bill from Ic.st-place St. Louis, 5 to 4, J
and then lost the second, 6 to 2.
The Cleveland Indians had more
trouble against sixth - place Chi
cago, losing two games, 2 to 1 and
G to 5, to fall into third place.
The Yankees' two wins gave them j
a sweep of the four-game set with |
the A's and boosted the Yanks' I
morale because of brilliant show- ;
ings by an old-timer and a kid.
The old-timer, of course, was 35-
year-old Joe DiMaggio, who belted
a three-run homer and two other j
hits in the first game to continue j
the slugging he has done since re
turning Friday after a week on the
bench. DiMag's blast off Alex Kell
ner came in the first inning after j
two walks and started steady Eddie
Lopat on the way to his 14th win,
a 10-hitter.
Rookie Ed Ford. 21 years old, '
came through for the Yanks in the :
nightcap by tossing a six-hiter for '
his fourth triumph without defeat, i
He now has allowed only one
earned run in 26Va innings. A j
three - run uprising against Joe j
Coleman in the fifth inning |
clinched this win.
The White Sox got two fine pitch- ,
ing performances and two clutch j
home runs that meant the differ- j
ence as they whipped the pennant- j
hopeful Indians twice. In the first
game, the Chisox' Bill Wight al
lowed only five hits to outhurl the
Indians' 18-game winner, Bob Lem
on. Marv Rickert's fourth - inning j
homer with one on gave Wight the

only two runs he needed. Bill
Pierce allowed three Tribe homers
in the second game—by A 1 Rosen,
Joe Gordon, and Thurman Tucker
—but the big swat was a homer by
Chicago's Gus Zernial that broke a
5-5 tie in the sixth.

gers won the first game of a twin I

The old-timer, of course, was 35-

a three-run homer and two other j
hits in the first game to continue j
the slugging he has done since re
turning Friday after a week on the
bench. DiMag's blast off Alex Kell

two walks and started steady Eddie
Lopat on the way to his 14th win,
a 10-hitter.
Rookie Ed Ford. 21 years old, '

nightcap by tossing a six-hiter for '
his fourth triumph without defeat, i
He now has allowed only one

clinched this win.
The White Sox got two fine pitch- ,

game, the Chisox' Bill Wight al
lowed only five hits to outhurl the
Indians' 18-game winner, Bob Lem
on. Marv Rickert's fourth - inning j
homer with one on gave Wight the

only two runs he needed. Bill
Pierce allowed three Tribe homers
in the second game—by A 1 Rosen,
Joe Gordon, and Thurman Tucker
—but the big swat was a homer by
Chicago's Gus Zernial that broke a
5-5 tie in the sixth.
