# Marine Reserves Made More Attractive With New Policies
## 
### 
Through word received yesterday
from Capt. W. W. Brown, officer in
charge of the San Francisco Ma
rine Corps Recruiting District, the
local Marine Corps recruiting office
was notified of several significant
changes in enlistment policies.
Principally of interest to young
men who wish to serve in the
Leathernecks for the duration of
the present police action, but do
not wish to obligate themselves for
a period of three or four years, is
the news that such young men may
now enlist in the Marine Corps Re
serve for an indefinite term, and
be ordered to active duty for a pe
riod in excess of 30 days. Such ac
tive duty will continue until their
services are no longer required, at
which time they will be returned to
an inactive status. Those applying
for such enlistment, who have had
prior service in any branch of the
armed forces, will be reappointed to
rank in accordance with current
regulations. As previously an
nounced, married men, or those
with dependents, may now be en
listed in the Marine Corps Reserve
for assignment to active duty.
It was further announced that
applicants with no prior service
may now be enlisted in the regular
Marine Corps for three- or four
year terms, and re-enlistments are

now being accepted for three, four,
or six years.
For complete details of these new
policies, those interested should
contact the Marine C< ... recruiting
office, Post Office Building, San
Jose.
