# Rail Strike Seems Likely
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 (UP)—
National leaders of two key rail
: unions ordered their members to
i day 1 to strike on schedule tomorrow
despite persistent reports that
President Truman will seize the
roads in the national interest.
Field reports said Presidential
Assistant John R. Steelman al
ready had urged seizure action. But
the White House insisted that Mr.
Truman is standing by his decision
not to intervene in the 17-month
old wage-contract dispute.
One government source said,
however, that Steelman talked with
the President by telephone this
morning. He did not know what
| was discussed, but it was deemed
i significant that Steelman did not
i schedule any further peace talks
j between the unions and the opera
| tors.
The strikes were called by the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen
and the Order of Railway Conduc
j tors to enforce their demands for
a shorter work week without loss
| of pay and other benefits.
Steelman has been working
around the clock in an effort to
head off the "piecemeal" walkouts
I which were scheduled to begin at (5
a.m. Monday, local time, at railroad
terminals in Cleveland, St. Paul.
Minn., and Louisville. Ky.
They will be followed by strikes
at G a.m. Tuesday on the Elgin, Jo
liet and Eastern Railroad at Chi
cago and the Pittsburgh & Lake
Erie at Pitsburgh.
The latter two roads are impor
tant to the steel industry and there
was strong belief that Mr. Truman
would be forced to seize them to
prevent any cutback in the Korean
war effort. Field representatives of
the P&LE said it would be taken
over by the government Monday.
Both walkouts are scheduled to
run only five days. As a result,
there was some doubt whether Mr.
Truman would ask the courts to
grant an anti - strike injunction
even if he does take over the roads.
Courts usually are reluctant to
! grant injunctions in limited strikes.
