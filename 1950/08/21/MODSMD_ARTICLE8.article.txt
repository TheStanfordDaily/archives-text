Why does Stanford persist in doing everything the hard way?
For two weeks the Corp Yard road gang shoveled, spread gravel,
and oiled the road from the Union to the University Press. But,
after the job was completely done, and the road as smooth as a
baby's cheek, somebody suddenly remembered there was a pipe
needed in the middle of the road, so out came the ditchdiggers to
rip up the beautiful paving job for the sake of the forgotten pipe.
We don't mind the bump in the road so much, but please, if any
body in Encina, Crothers, or Stern wants a pipe line laid, let's do it
now, before the roads in that area are completely overhauled.

The exam files at the Reserve Book Room are a wonderful inno
vation—not only do they provide an excellent method of review
ing but they also do away with the injustice that the fraternity files
caused the non-fraternity students. Lately, however, we have no
ticed a complete lack of responsibility on the part of students to
keep these files in even useable condition. It takes but a minute to
replace them in their proper spot in the case, but instead, every
body seems to be content just to throw them in a big pile on the
table. Trying to find the exam you want is like searching for that
old needle in the haystack. Either the students themselves should
keep the files in good, useable condition, or else the library should
appoint a "keeper of the files" to take over the job.

And while we are on the subject of the main libe, aren't wc over
going to yet decent lights in the big room upstairs? The RBR has
beautiful lighting eguipment, but along around dead week and
exam time, the RBR is so crowded that many students overflow into
the bigger room where the lighting is terrible. A little money
spent on improving these lights would save a lot of optometrist
bills.

As the quarter draws to a close, it seems an appropriate time to
extend a rousing vote of thanks to Excom and the Social Committee
who have worked long and hard this summer to provide entertain
ment for the entire campus under a limited budget and with limited
personnel. We often forget the Excom members who meet every
Wednesday night to hash out the many problems of the campus
and try and keep the different organsoor. r the campus community
working together in harmony, but if Excom weue to disband all of
a sudden, we would really find out how big a job they have done.
Besides the work they did this year, they have also submitted
tangible recommendations to next summer's executives—a task for
which they are to be congratudated.

which they are to be congratudated.
Why does Stanford persist in doing everything the hard way?
For two weeks the Corp Yard road gang shoveled, spread gravel,
and oiled the road from the Union to the University Press. But,
after the job was completely done, and the road as smooth as a
baby's cheek, somebody suddenly remembered there was a pipe
needed in the middle of the road, so out came the ditchdiggers to
rip up the beautiful paving job for the sake of the forgotten pipe.
We don't mind the bump in the road so much, but please, if any
body in Encina, Crothers, or Stern wants a pipe line laid, let's do it
now, before the roads in that area are completely overhauled.

The exam files at the Reserve Book Room are a wonderful inno
vation—not only do they provide an excellent method of review
ing but they also do away with the injustice that the fraternity files
caused the non-fraternity students. Lately, however, we have no
ticed a complete lack of responsibility on the part of students to
keep these files in even useable condition. It takes but a minute to
replace them in their proper spot in the case, but instead, every
body seems to be content just to throw them in a big pile on the
table. Trying to find the exam you want is like searching for that
old needle in the haystack. Either the students themselves should
keep the files in good, useable condition, or else the library should
appoint a "keeper of the files" to take over the job.

And while we are on the subject of the main libe, aren't wc over
going to yet decent lights in the big room upstairs? The RBR has
beautiful lighting eguipment, but along around dead week and
exam time, the RBR is so crowded that many students overflow into
the bigger room where the lighting is terrible. A little money
spent on improving these lights would save a lot of optometrist
bills.

As the quarter draws to a close, it seems an appropriate time to
extend a rousing vote of thanks to Excom and the Social Committee
who have worked long and hard this summer to provide entertain
ment for the entire campus under a limited budget and with limited
personnel. We often forget the Excom members who meet every
Wednesday night to hash out the many problems of the campus
and try and keep the different organsoor. r the campus community
working together in harmony, but if Excom weue to disband all of
a sudden, we would really find out how big a job they have done.
Besides the work they did this year, they have also submitted
tangible recommendations to next summer's executives—a task for
which they are to be congratudated.
