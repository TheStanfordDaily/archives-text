To the Editor:
What's the matter with us, why are we reacting to the Korean situation
in this way? People are looking at this conflict in a way totally different
from that of the last war. As I remember it, everyone knew that we had
a dirty job to do then, but the majority were willing and eager to go out
and do their part. Now what happens? No one gives a darn, seemingly,
whether we win or not. All they want to think about is saving their own
skins. The other day I had the dubious pleasure of being warmly con
gratulated by a doctor who informed me that I had a condition that made
me irrevocably 4-F. This makes me mad. Why does everyone assume that
1 m trying to get out ol it? I am ashamed to be classed with the majority
because, actually, I still really believe in patriotism. But this time I'm
being loyal to the world, loyal enough to want to do my part in this civil
war for unity.
It seems that all of the idealism is gone out of this world. Ours was to
be the generation to save the world; now it looks like ours Ls to be the
generation to go all out in trying to save its individual self. We are no
longer interested in the ideal of a peaceful world; we are interested only
in existing. The only way for us to improve our position on this earth is by
striving toward some almost unattainable goal. Are we gointj to give up
this goal of a peaceful world just because it is out of our reach at the mo
ment? W(> can't expect world unity in a short time; people have been work
ing for it since the world began, and we are so much closer to it now that
we should be happy knowing that the goal is right around the corner.
I he cooler, elder heads of the UN are still striving with superhuman
effort towa'd this goal, and they expect that when they cease there will
be a new set, a group of younger statesmen, schooled in the cause of an
all-embracing humanity. Instead, what do they find? A group of up-and
coming statesmen who are working toward the greatest possible disunity.
"Take to the hills," seems to be the cry; "avoid the draft, stay out of service,
every man for himself and the devil take the rest of the world."
People say that I'm not facing the realities of war. I have no illusions
about this, but I'm sick of being congratulated for being 4-F. I want to help
save this world and I hope there are others who want to help too.

We're All in This Together
To the Editor:
What's the matter with us, why are we reacting to the Korean situation
in this way? People are looking at this conflict in a way totally different
from that of the last war. As I remember it, everyone knew that we had
a dirty job to do then, but the majority were willing and eager to go out
and do their part. Now what happens? No one gives a darn, seemingly,
whether we win or not. All they want to think about is saving their own
skins. The other day I had the dubious pleasure of being warmly con
gratulated by a doctor who informed me that I had a condition that made
me irrevocably 4-F. This makes me mad. Why does everyone assume that
1 m trying to get out ol it? I am ashamed to be classed with the majority
because, actually, I still really believe in patriotism. But this time I'm
being loyal to the world, loyal enough to want to do my part in this civil
war for unity.
It seems that all of the idealism is gone out of this world. Ours was to
be the generation to save the world; now it looks like ours Ls to be the
generation to go all out in trying to save its individual self. We are no
longer interested in the ideal of a peaceful world; we are interested only
in existing. The only way for us to improve our position on this earth is by
striving toward some almost unattainable goal. Are we gointj to give up
this goal of a peaceful world just because it is out of our reach at the mo
ment? W(> can't expect world unity in a short time; people have been work
ing for it since the world began, and we are so much closer to it now that
we should be happy knowing that the goal is right around the corner.
I he cooler, elder heads of the UN are still striving with superhuman
effort towa'd this goal, and they expect that when they cease there will
be a new set, a group of younger statesmen, schooled in the cause of an
all-embracing humanity. Instead, what do they find? A group of up-and
coming statesmen who are working toward the greatest possible disunity.
"Take to the hills," seems to be the cry; "avoid the draft, stay out of service,
every man for himself and the devil take the rest of the world."
People say that I'm not facing the realities of war. I have no illusions
about this, but I'm sick of being congratulated for being 4-F. I want to help
save this world and I hope there are others who want to help too.
