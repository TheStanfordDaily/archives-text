REDS MASS TROOPS AS YANKS GAIN—Counterattacking Ameri
cans wiped out an enemy spearhead near Yuchon (1) only 155 miles west
of vital supply port of Pusan. In other sectors, UN forces scored gains
while Communists massed troops in four areas (broken arrows) for pos
sible major drives on Taegu (2) and Pusan. South Koreans captured
vital high ground 15 miles north of Taegu, meeting Red pressure all along
the line from Waegan to Kunwi. On east coast (3), South Koreans
pushed spearheads north of Pohang and Kigye, easing threat to Ameri
can airfield near Pohang. Near Changyong (4), where Red bridgehead
was erased, U.S. patrol crossed the Naktong, while Communists
strengthened their lone remaining Naktong bridgehead at Hyonpung.
