## Transformation

June 22, 1950—Close to 3,000 carefree students jammed the Pa
vilion to register for "just another" summer quarter at Stanford.
'Everybody was in a wonderful mood as they talked of the long
weekends on the beach, their easy courses, and other advantages
of summer on the Farm.
June 25, 1950 —A bright summer Sunday. Suddenly the regu
lar broadcasts were interrupted with news of an attack on the tiny
republic of Korea by the Communist-sponsored armies of the
north. At first, the reports were similar to those of December 7,
1941, but then they died down a bit and students, for the most part,
shrugged their shoulders and talked of "just another revolution"
.in some insignificant little country halfway around the world.
Little did they realize on that bright Sunday afternoon that world
shaking events were taking place in the republic of South Korea.
But, as the summer wore on, July ran into August, the student body
more and more came to realize how things really stood. They
began to understand that we are now openly fighting Communism
on the battlefield, that the cold war had turned uncomfortably hot.
At the beginning of the summer we accused the students of
living in an ivory tower, of being unconcerned with all the impor
tant world developments taking place in Korea and at Lake Suc
cess. We begged the campus to take a look around and to climb
out of its shell.
Today, two months later our wish has come true. The campus is
awake, its eyes are open, and the students have acquired a lively
interest in the problems of the world a; large. No longer do they
concern themselves completely with the immediate problems of
life, for they realize that the war in Korea is as important to their
welfare as is anything happening here on campus.
We have come a long way since we signed those reg books nine
weeks ago—we have seen the start of what might turn into World
War 111. But we have watched these developments with our eyes
wide open, knowing where our actions might lead us. None of us
know what the future will bring, either individually or as a group,
but we do know that we are awake, come what may we are pre
pared and we cannot lose.
