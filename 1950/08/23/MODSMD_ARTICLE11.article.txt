## Now Idealism 
### 
To the Editor:
The writer of Monday's letter to the editor and I have several things in
common: we are both interested in the ideal of a peaceful world and want to
■vork tor it, we both deplore the lack of idealism in America and we both
aren't going to be on the firing line with guns—he because he is 4-F, and I
because I am an objector to war. Basically, however, I think we look at
present international problems through different glasses.
I don't believe it is possible to achieve world unity through any kind of
»var, unless it be the world unity of dictatorship. The process of fighting the
war must lead away from the necessary prerequisites to peaceful coopera
tion. It produces fear, hate and insecurity, and these are not bases for peace,
it reduces individual freedom—and the road back to freedom is seldom easy
and never complete. War negates the one principle upon which a peaceful
and cooperating world must unite —respect for the dignity of the individual
life and personality.
The very thing which Monday's writer deplores he supports in the ap
proach he takes to the problem. A lack of idealism cannot be satisfied by
the false idealism involved in dropping more bombs, killing more people
jnd destroying more land, homes and factories—all in the name of freedom
:>r unity or cooperation or democracy. The kind of idealism needed today
is one which is able to go beyond thinking slavishly in terms of old patterns
and old "solutions." A truly new approach must be substituted which looks
co the future, solving problems by means which are consistent with the
ends to be achieved. Feace can come only through readiness to meet "the
enemy" half way, through willingness to admit mistakes and rectify past
errors. These methods can develop the foundations for peace in friendship,
confidence, security, and individual self-respect.
The old idealism of war will not inspire a generation that has seen two
wars fought for that idealism with little constructive result. This genera
tion needs and must demand a new idealism filled with hope, one based upon
he dignity of man, one greater than the confines of a single nation, one in
which the means used will produce the ends desired.
