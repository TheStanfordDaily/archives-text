To the Editor:
This is in answer to the opinion of ' Name Withheld," in the Campus
Opinion column of The Daily, Monday, August 21, 1950:
I think the spirit of your patriotism and idealism is to be commended.
However, I cannot back your proclamation, "ours was to be the generation
to save the world." Having spent four years in the last unpleasantness—
which, by the way, was entered into in the spirit of defeating only the Axis
powers, not to save a world—l retain great respect for the individual self.
Yes, and I mean myself, too. There are, to be sure, a few individuals at Lake
Success working for the ideal, but there is damn Little activity elsewhere in
this respect. That this generation should be singled out by you or anybody
else to carry the load is a project too superheated for ;ne. I cannot conceive
myself spending a Lifetime in an army, even an army dedicated to this pur
pose. Your "cause of an all-embracing humanity" is a fine phrase, but
rather vague; it went out, or should have, about 1918. Humanity does not
wish or accept every embrace, even well-meaning embraces.
And me? If called, I would probably go, but not very willingly or happily.
The goal is not "Right around the corner," by a long ways, not even the
7,000-mile "corner" from Korea to Moscow. Your "devil" has had the world
foi a long time, and will continue to flourish, so I suggest you keep as calm
as possible, and don't read any history after midnight. This habit tends to
lower one's resistance toward a Droper use of the critical faculties.
