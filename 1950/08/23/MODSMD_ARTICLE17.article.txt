NEW YORK. Aug. 22 (CP)—
Squat Yogi Berra. the catcher |
who looks like a perpendicular
blimp, went on a personal blast- I
nig expedition today, drivni,g in
six runs with four hits to give the
New York Yankees a 13 to (i vic
tory over Detroit and cut the Ti- ;
gers' league lead to 2 1 games.
The second - place Yankees hit j
with glee against three Detroit I
pitchers, getting a total of 14 safe ;
blows including homers by Johnny |
Mize. Gene Woodling, and Berra. !
It was New York's fifth straight
victory and it came at a desperate
:ime. A defeat in the opener of this !
hree-game vital series would have j
out them 4V / 2 games behind.
Berra began his maltreatment of
he Tigers in a three-run Yankee |
irst inning when he sent home two
•uns with a singo, after which Mize
J .rove in another with a fly ball.
<rter Hal White, who had beaten 1
he Yankees with a superb two-hit
er when they were last in Detroit,
vas batted out in the third when j
he Yankees scored four more runs, j
•.e got by well enough until Berra '
nd two more on Mize's homer j
vhich greeted reliever Martin Stu
rt.
Stuart went the way of White
i.hen the Yankees kept pecking
way, adding single runs in the
jurth, fifth, and sixth innings when
Voodling homered and Phil Rizzuto
.ngled in the sixth. Rookie Bill r

Connelly cmae on to mop up and
he got by well enuogh until Berra
wound up the day's damage with a
three-run homer in the eighth in
ning.
The Tigers, who were forced to
gamble with the in-and-out White
because of a shortage of front-line
pitchers, were badly beaten but not
disgraced. They got their own big
bats into action in the later innings
against Allie Reynolds.
The Yankee hurler, who had suf
fered three defeats at the hands of
Detroit this season, either elected
to coast or became arm weary.
And in the eighth the Tigers scored
four runs, three on a homer by
Johnny Groth. Reynolds then bore
down and retired the side with two
strikeouts and a pop foul. Singles
by Don Kolloway and George Kill
and a fly by Vic Wertz gave De
troit a final run in the ninth when
it really didn't matter much.
Kell, the league's leading bats
man, set the 11-hit pace of the
Tigers with three singles.
It was the 11th victory for Rey
nolds, who also has lost 11 games,
while White, the loser, suffered his
fifth defeat.
The line score:
Detroit .... 001 000 041— 611 0
New York . 304 111 03x—13 14 0
White, Stuart (3), Connelly (6)
