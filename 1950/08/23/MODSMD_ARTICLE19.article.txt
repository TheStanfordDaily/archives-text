SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 22 (UP) —
Don Heinrich, the University of
Washington's ace passing quarter
back, has been ordered to active
duty with the Army at Fort Ord,
Calif., Sept. 8, the Washington Mili
tary District said today.
However, there is a possibility
Heinrich may be deferred for one
quarter. Capt. Nat M. Scaler, public
information officer at the district, said
university students are eligible for
deferment if they are registered in
school at the time they are called to
duty.
Heinrich had been a member of the
405 th Active Reserve Anti-Aircraft

he went on inactive status and the
Army froze all inactive units with
the beginning of the Korean war.
A recent War Department order
called all inactive reserves to duty

with the Army.
Loss of Heinrich would be a serious
blow to Husky grid chances this fall,
as the Bremerton youth was one of
the top passers on the Coast last year.
