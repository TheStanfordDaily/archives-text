# U.S. Army Intelligence Relates Story of Murder of Gen. Dean
## 
### 
WITH U.S. FORCES IN KOREA.
Wednesday, Aug. 23 (UP) — Maj.
Gen. William F. Dean, the hero of
Taejon, was stabbed to death by a
North Korean as he lay helplessly
wounded—a prisoner of war—out
side burning city, intelligence
reports said today.
The Communist who murdered
him may now himself be a prisoner
of war somewhere in the American
: defense perimeter.
Dean disappeared after he re
mained in Taejon with a tiny rear
j guard of his 24th Infantry Division,
fighting off a Red army which swept
into the city.
He was listed officially as "miss
ing in action" on July 22.
Since then Army intelligence op
eratives have tried to find out what
happened. This is the story as the
intelligence men have pieced it to
gether from reports by Gl's and
North Korean prisoners:
Dean gave the order to withdraw
and tried to escape the city with
the last of his rear guard. He be
came separated from other mem
bers of the party. He made it as
far as a railroad underpass on the
! outskirts. A North Korean shot
him through the side. He dropped,
; and was unable to move. The North
; Korean then stabbed him to death.
The investigation is continuing
| but this appears to be what it will
J finally bring out.
Dean was approaching his 51st
l birthday —he was born August 1,
1899—when he went to Korea with
! his 24th Division. The division was
j thrown piecemeal into the war from
J the arrival of its first units at Osan
July 21 to prevent the utter rout of
the South Korean army.

It was the job of his men to fight
odds of 15 and 20 to one until they
were overwhelmed, and then re
treat. Dean was known in World
War II in Europe as a front-line
general, and he remained cne.
In burning Taejon, he stayed with
his rear guard while the main force
retreated by his order. He was s"eti
working with a bazooka team, and
he went to a command post to say:
"I just got me a tank."
