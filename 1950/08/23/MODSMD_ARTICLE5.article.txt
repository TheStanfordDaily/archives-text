LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Aug. 22—
The United States, ridiculing Soviet
propaganda in the United Nations,
today dismissed as "applesauce"
Russia's charges that this country
is guilty of "aggression" in Korea.
American Delegate Warren R.
Austin, accusing the Kremlin of us
ing Hitlers propaganda methods,
j said the effort to picture the United
j States as the aggressor "is a false-
J hood so grotesque that even the
technique of the big lie cannot dis
guise it."
"The aggressor is the North Ko
rean regime," Austin told the Secu
i rity Council, adding that this was
the unanimous judgment of the So
viet - spurned UN regime on the
spot.
Austin's derisive speech came af
ter Malik had taken up most of the
regular afternoon period with a
new tirade made up mostly of old
Soviet charges in the Korean crisis.
Malik rejected any idea of putting
North Korea under UN trusteeship
I jnd repeated Russia's insistence
1 that foreign troops must be with

drawn from Korea before there can
be a peace settlement.
WASHINGTON — The Senate to
night passed a bill to grant living
allowances of $45 to $75 a month
for the families of enlisted service
men.
The bipartisan measure was
adopted by unanimous voice vote
soon after the House Armed Serv
ices Committee approved a similar
bill with allowances ranging up to
$83 a month. The latter measure is
scheduled for floor action Thursday.
NEW YORK—A proposal by the
American Temperance Society for
a law requiring bartenders to give
motorists a sobriety test just about
blew the bung out of the barrel
here today.
"That's all I got to do, I suppose,
t;ive sobriety tests," said Archie
Fall of Archie's Old Reliable Cafe.
"I call their wives in here. That
makes 'em so sober they could walk
a tight rope."
Executive Secretary W. A.

Scharffenberg of the Temperance
Society urged in Washington that
bartenders take car keys from mo
torists before serving them and
maintain a "hangover lodge" where
drinkers would be given a "simple
scientific test" to prove their fitness
to drive.
PARIS—The French cabinet an
nounced today it would send a re
inforced infantry battalion to Korea
in response to Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur's appeal for more United
Nations ground forces.
A reinforced infantry battalion
probably would be about 1.000 men,
but the cabinet announcement gave
no further details. It did not say
when the troops would be dis
patched to Korea, although Mac-
Arthur has asked for reinforce
ments immediately.
Informed sources said the unit
might come from French Indo-
China, where the French army al
ready has its hands full fighting
Communist - led rebels. However.
France has a large standing army
in this country to draw from.

j said the effort to picture the United
j States as the aggressor "is a false-
J hood so grotesque that even the
technique of the big lie cannot dis

"The aggressor is the North Ko

i rity Council, adding that this was
the unanimous judgment of the So
viet - spurned UN regime on the
spot.
Austin's derisive speech came af
ter Malik had taken up most of the
regular afternoon period with a
new tirade made up mostly of old
Soviet charges in the Korean crisis.
Malik rejected any idea of putting
North Korea under UN trusteeship

drawn from Korea before there can
be a peace settlement.
WASHINGTON — The Senate to
night passed a bill to grant living
allowances of $45 to $75 a month
for the families of enlisted service
men.
The bipartisan measure was
adopted by unanimous voice vote
soon after the House Armed Serv
ices Committee approved a similar
bill with allowances ranging up to
$83 a month. The latter measure is
scheduled for floor action Thursday.
NEW YORK—A proposal by the
American Temperance Society for
a law requiring bartenders to give
motorists a sobriety test just about
blew the bung out of the barrel
here today.
"That's all I got to do, I suppose,
t;ive sobriety tests," said Archie
Fall of Archie's Old Reliable Cafe.
"I call their wives in here. That
makes 'em so sober they could walk
a tight rope."
Executive Secretary W. A.

Scharffenberg of the Temperance
Society urged in Washington that
bartenders take car keys from mo
torists before serving them and
maintain a "hangover lodge" where
drinkers would be given a "simple
scientific test" to prove their fitness
to drive.
PARIS—The French cabinet an
nounced today it would send a re
inforced infantry battalion to Korea
in response to Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur's appeal for more United
Nations ground forces.
A reinforced infantry battalion
probably would be about 1.000 men,
but the cabinet announcement gave
no further details. It did not say
when the troops would be dis
patched to Korea, although Mac-
Arthur has asked for reinforce
ments immediately.
Informed sources said the unit
might come from French Indo-
China, where the French army al
ready has its hands full fighting
Communist - led rebels. However.
France has a large standing army
in this country to draw from.
