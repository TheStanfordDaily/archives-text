## Main U.S. Lilies Held Firm By Tired, Stubborn Yanks

TOKYO, Wednesday, Aug. 23 (UP)â€”Commu
nist troops attacking from the north plunged to
within nine miles of Taegu today before being
beaten off by American defenders of the key

city.
Five times last night and this
morning the North Koreans charged
into the American lines in attempts
to cut the main road to Taegu behind
troops of the U.S. 27th Regiment.
Each time they were repulsed by the
Americans who had artillerymen and
cooks fighting as infantrymen.
It was the fifth day of Communist
assaults along the road to Taegu, and
Col. John Michaelis, commander of
the 27th Regiment, said the next two
nights "will determine whether we
lose Taegu or break their backs com
pletely."
On two other fronts the U.S. forces
stalled a Communist push toward
Pusan in the south and attacked the
North Koreans' only remaining Nak
tong River bridgehead at Hyonpung.
American staff officers with the
forces north of Taegu said the Reds
apparently were preparing a major
attack on the northwest corner of the
Allied defense line.
United Press correspondent Robert
Vermillion reported from the Taegu
front that the main American lines
still were 15 miles north of the city
but fighting flared along the road as
far as six miles behind the front.
At 6 a.m. today the Americans beat
back the fifth Communist thrust of
the night with the fire from two bat
teries of howitzers The attacks were
launched from a Communist penetra
tion along ridges to the U.S. right'
flank where the South Koreans had
by-passed the Reds in an advance
that failed to draw enemy opposition
yesterday.
Vermillion reported that the Com
munists were dug in on high ground
(i(JO yards from the American com
mand post. American B-26's, F-51's,
and F-80's rained 44,000 pounds of
bombs on the Reds less than a half
mile from the American positions.
