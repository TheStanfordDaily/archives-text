WASHINGTON. Aug. 22 (UP) —
The threat of a major railroad
strike that might have crippled the
Korean war efTort was temporarily
removed tonight when union lead
ers said they will not extend their
present walkout at this time.
The assurance was given by offi
cials of the striking Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen and the Order
of Railway Conductors after Presi
dential Asssitant John R. Steelman
had failed in new efforts to end the
"piecemeal" strikes which began
Monday morning.
They emphasized that the deci
sion was taken "out of considera
tion" for President Truman. It will
have no effect on the five - day
walkouts now in effect on two im
portant shortlines and three termi
nal railroads.
Union officials flatly denied the
President had requested such ac
tion or to comment on speculation
that they may have hope for an
early end of the present deadlock.
