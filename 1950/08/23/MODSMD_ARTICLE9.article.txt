# Expects Present Hostilities To Be Over by Next Spring
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (UP)—Military lead
ers expect the Korean war to end by next spring
but the Communist threat elsewhere will keep
U.S. defense spending above $25,000,000,000
annually for many years, it was revealed today.

Their estimates were disclosed ir.
the published record of closed
hearings by the House Appropria
tions Committee on President Tru
man's emergency request for $16.-
000,000,000 in extra defense funds.
Defense Secretary Louis Johnson,
Secretary of State Dean Acheson,
Gen. Omar N. Bradley, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other
high military officers testified.
Johnson expressed "hope" the
fighting in Korea will be no more
than "a six or eight months' propo
sition." But he said the build-up
of American fighting forces will
continue for two or three years, and
that defense spending should "level
off in 1955 at $24,600,000,000 a year,
not counting foreign arms aid.
All of the officials emphasized
that the outlook hinges on the as
sumption Russia will not strike
elsewhere and start a third world
war.
Johnson said that grim possibility
cannot be ruled out. He warned
that the mobilization costs he out
lined would be just the first in
stallment if the Korean war should
turn out to be only "the beginning
of larger things."
Johnson said no special report:
was received from U.S. intelligence
agencies warning of the Red at
tack in Korea. But he hinted at a
shake-up of intelligence services,
and said, "I think we have the right
to expect now that our intelligence
is going to be pretty good."'
His statement was made before
the White House announcement last
week that Lt. Gen. Walter Bedel
Smith, former ambassador to Rus
sia, will be named chief of the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency succeeding
Rear Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter.
The hearings brought out many
details of U.S. rearmament for the
first time. It was disclosed that:
The Navy has called up 53,000 ret
servists and plans to call another
35,000 to help man a fleet of 911
ships by the end of this fiscal year.
The Army plans to activate one
new combat division and two re
placement training divisions. It had
10 divisions at the outbreak of the
war, and since has called four Na
tional Guard divisions into active
duty.
The Air Force will use the extra
funds to buy 4,428 planes, bringing
its front line combat strength to
15,000 aircraft.

The Navy has called up 53,000 ret
servists and plans to call another
35,000 to help man a fleet of 911
ships by the end of this fiscal year.
The Army plans to activate one
new combat division and two re
placement training divisions. It had
10 divisions at the outbreak of the
war, and since has called four Na
tional Guard divisions into active
duty.
The Air Force will use the extra
funds to buy 4,428 planes, bringing
its front line combat strength to
15,000 aircraft.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (UP)—Military lead
ers expect the Korean war to end by next spring
but the Communist threat elsewhere will keep
U.S. defense spending above $25,000,000,000
annually for many years, it was revealed today.

Their estimates were disclosed ir.
the published record of closed
hearings by the House Appropria
tions Committee on President Tru
man's emergency request for $16.-
000,000,000 in extra defense funds.
Defense Secretary Louis Johnson,
Secretary of State Dean Acheson,
Gen. Omar N. Bradley, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other
high military officers testified.
Johnson expressed "hope" the
fighting in Korea will be no more
than "a six or eight months' propo
sition." But he said the build-up
of American fighting forces will
continue for two or three years, and
that defense spending should "level
off in 1955 at $24,600,000,000 a year,
not counting foreign arms aid.
All of the officials emphasized
that the outlook hinges on the as
sumption Russia will not strike
elsewhere and start a third world
war.
Johnson said that grim possibility
cannot be ruled out. He warned
that the mobilization costs he out
lined would be just the first in
stallment if the Korean war should
turn out to be only "the beginning
of larger things."
Johnson said no special report:
was received from U.S. intelligence
agencies warning of the Red at
tack in Korea. But he hinted at a
shake-up of intelligence services,
and said, "I think we have the right
to expect now that our intelligence
is going to be pretty good."'
His statement was made before
the White House announcement last
week that Lt. Gen. Walter Bedel
Smith, former ambassador to Rus
sia, will be named chief of the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency succeeding
Rear Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter.
The hearings brought out many
details of U.S. rearmament for the
first time. It was disclosed that:
