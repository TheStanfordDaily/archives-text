# Indians Open 'THE Year?' Against Spartans Tomorrow
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's 1950 Big Red Machine, rated the strongest Card team
since before the war, will open a rugged 10-game campaign at
2:30 tomorrow against the San Jose State Spartans in spacious
Stanford Stadium.
Coach Marchie Schwartz's charges will enter their initial con-

test at full strength except for Half
back Eric Southwood, who is recov
ering from an ankle injury.
However, Halfback Harry Huga
sian, who is favoring a sore ankle,
and guard Jess Cone, who received a
cracked rib in a scrimmage last week,
are slated for limited action only.
Under a new coach, Bob Bronzan,
San Jose will field a small, inexperi
enced squad. Only two men, quar
terback Genes Mcnges and Bob Wil
son, are back from last year's first
team, which the Cards beat, 49 to 0, in
their opening game of the season.
Kcrkorian To Lead T
Leading the Cards' high-geared T
for the second straight year will be
Grry Kcrkorian, Stanford's deceptive
quarterback. The crafty T wizard
seems to have recovered completely
from a shoulder injury received in
spring practice, and should be ready
to roll this season.
At !cit half, veteran Boyd Benson
will get the starting call. Benson,
who averaged 5.8 yards per carry
last season, has ben looking great in
scrimmages this week.
Bob White, who ran 76 yards to a
touchdown in the USC rout last year,
will open at the right half spot.

White will also see action at a de
fensive halfback position.
The only newcomer to Stanford's
high-powered backfield will be Bob
GrifTin, a 6-foot, 205-pound junior
from San Francisco. A powerful run
ner, GrifTin broke away for several
long gains in last Saturday's Stadium
scrimmage.
Leading the Indians' forward wall
will be Stanford's 225-pound All -
American candidate Bill McColl, who
will start at both offensive left end
and defensive right end tomorrow.
McColl, who caught 27 passes for
.'5OB yards last season, has been look
ing better than ever in practices this
season. Junior Jack Rye will again
open at defensive left end this year,
while speedy Wilbur Taylor is slated
to see plenty of action.
White At Tackle
Starting at left tackle will be vet
eran Gordon "Tex" White, who will
open at this position for the third
straight year. Backing up White will
be Ted Taylor and Leon King, both
up from the J Vs.
Norm Manoogian, the only sopho
more in the opening lineup will get
the starting nod at left guard. Norm,
who was awarded the outstanding
freshman player trophy last season,
nosed out Dick Lucas, last year's
first string man, for the opening con
test tomorrow.
JC transfer Rod Garner will begin
at defensive left guard.
Dick Abraham, 215-pound, fi-foot
2-inch senior, will start at center.
Doug Tharrier, up from the jayvecs,
and AI Hanner, frosh pivot star,
will probably see action tomorrow
against the Spartans.
At offensive guard, rugged Owen
Powell will probably begin in place
of the injured Jess Cone. Veteran
Dick Gaedtke is slated for defensive
action.
Rough-and-ready Russ Ponieroy
will see double duty tomorrow. The '
205-pound, G-foot star will open at
both offensive light tackle and de
fensive linebacker. John Broderick,
;ii) outstanding lineman on last year's '
freshman team, will start at defen
sive light tackle.
Bruce Van Alstyne and Bill MeColl
will divide the offensive and defen- i
•' ive right end chores against San Jose j
tomorrow.
In addition to Pomeroy, huge Nel- |
vi!l< Calfee, a junior college transfer,
will start as defensive linebacker.
Quarterback Dick Horn, who will
handle the punting chores this sea
son along with Bill McColl, will open

at the safety position. Backs who
will probably see plenty of action to
morrow include Joe St. Geme, Dick
Broome, Bobby Bryan, Skip Crist,
Wes Laubscher, and Bob Myers.

Stanford's 1950 Big Red Machine, rated the strongest Card team
since before the war, will open a rugged 10-game campaign at
2:30 tomorrow against the San Jose State Spartans in spacious
Stanford Stadium.
Coach Marchie Schwartz's charges will enter their initial con-

test at full strength except for Half
back Eric Southwood, who is recov
ering from an ankle injury.
However, Halfback Harry Huga
sian, who is favoring a sore ankle,
and guard Jess Cone, who received a
cracked rib in a scrimmage last week,
are slated for limited action only.
Under a new coach, Bob Bronzan,
San Jose will field a small, inexperi
enced squad. Only two men, quar
terback Genes Mcnges and Bob Wil
son, are back from last year's first
team, which the Cards beat, 49 to 0, in
their opening game of the season.
Kcrkorian To Lead T
Leading the Cards' high-geared T
for the second straight year will be
Grry Kcrkorian, Stanford's deceptive
quarterback. The crafty T wizard
seems to have recovered completely
from a shoulder injury received in
spring practice, and should be ready
to roll this season.
At !cit half, veteran Boyd Benson
will get the starting call. Benson,
who averaged 5.8 yards per carry
last season, has ben looking great in
scrimmages this week.
Bob White, who ran 76 yards to a
touchdown in the USC rout last year,
will open at the right half spot.

White will also see action at a de
fensive halfback position.
The only newcomer to Stanford's
high-powered backfield will be Bob
GrifTin, a 6-foot, 205-pound junior
from San Francisco. A powerful run
ner, GrifTin broke away for several
long gains in last Saturday's Stadium
scrimmage.
Leading the Indians' forward wall
will be Stanford's 225-pound All -
American candidate Bill McColl, who
will start at both offensive left end
and defensive right end tomorrow.
McColl, who caught 27 passes for
.'5OB yards last season, has been look
ing better than ever in practices this
season. Junior Jack Rye will again
open at defensive left end this year,
while speedy Wilbur Taylor is slated
to see plenty of action.
White At Tackle
Starting at left tackle will be vet
eran Gordon "Tex" White, who will
open at this position for the third
straight year. Backing up White will
be Ted Taylor and Leon King, both
up from the J Vs.
Norm Manoogian, the only sopho
more in the opening lineup will get
the starting nod at left guard. Norm,
who was awarded the outstanding
freshman player trophy last season,
nosed out Dick Lucas, last year's
first string man, for the opening con
test tomorrow.
JC transfer Rod Garner will begin
at defensive left guard.
Dick Abraham, 215-pound, fi-foot
2-inch senior, will start at center.
Doug Tharrier, up from the jayvecs,
and AI Hanner, frosh pivot star,
will probably see action tomorrow
against the Spartans.
At offensive guard, rugged Owen
Powell will probably begin in place
of the injured Jess Cone. Veteran
Dick Gaedtke is slated for defensive
action.
Rough-and-ready Russ Ponieroy
will see double duty tomorrow. The '
205-pound, G-foot star will open at
both offensive light tackle and de
fensive linebacker. John Broderick,
;ii) outstanding lineman on last year's '
freshman team, will start at defen
sive light tackle.
Bruce Van Alstyne and Bill MeColl
will divide the offensive and defen- i
•' ive right end chores against San Jose j
tomorrow.
In addition to Pomeroy, huge Nel- |
vi!l< Calfee, a junior college transfer,
will start as defensive linebacker.
