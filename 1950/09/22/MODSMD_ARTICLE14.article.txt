The largest freshman class in history and a
lowered ratio highlight registration predictions
as Stanford enters its sixtieth academic year
Monday.
The class of '54 enters Stanford 1,084 strong,

topping by 121 last year's record of
963 freshmen. Boys make up 716 of
the new students, and girls 368, a
ratio of 2.85 to 1, a marked decrease
from the famous 3.2:1 which stood
since 1947. The enrollment of more
women than predicted, plus the fa<:t
that more women were accepted than
before because less men applied, ac
| accounts for the ratio increase.
Dormitory space for women will bo
at a premium because of the increase,
and the acceptance for winter quarter
of many women who entered this
summer is expected to add to the
! critical situation in the women's
housing area.
Harvey Hall, who succeeds Dean
R. Donald Winbigler as registrar, set.
the new enrollment figure at 7,500,
300 below last year. Hall hinted,
however, that 7,700 students may
show up by the end of registration.
Asked if the draft call would affect
enrollment, Hall said that the num
ber of men who left for the servico
may be balanced by the men re
enrolling to finish school before
they are called.
In the graduate school, a drop of
approximately 320 students, to 2,520,
is expected. This will be offset par
tially by the lower division increase.
4 to 5:30 p.m. Students should wear
campus clothes.
Thursday at 7 p.m., members of the
Pre-Reg committee will present
speakers who will discuss extracur
ricular activities and their place in
the freshman's program. The fresh
man men will meet at Encina and the
women in Cubberley Auditorium. A
speaker will also talk at the Village
for freshmen there. A few days after
the discussions, open house will be
held by the various activity groups.
Football movies of last year's Stan
ford-USC game will be shown at a
meeting for transfer students at 8
p.m. Thursday in the Lower Lounge
of the Women's Clubhouse. Former
football star Pete Kmetovic will give
the narrative. Refreshments will be
served.
A reception for foreign students
will be held Friday afternoon at 4 at
the home of W. M. Waterous, foreign
student adviser, at 625 Mayfield. Be
sides this event, foreign students are

topping by 121 last year's record of
963 freshmen. Boys make up 716 of
the new students, and girls 368, a
ratio of 2.85 to 1, a marked decrease
from the famous 3.2:1 which stood
since 1947. The enrollment of more
women than predicted, plus the fa<:t
that more women were accepted than
before because less men applied, ac
| accounts for the ratio increase.
Dormitory space for women will bo
at a premium because of the increase,
and the acceptance for winter quarter
of many women who entered this
summer is expected to add to the
! critical situation in the women's
housing area.

The largest freshman class in history and a
lowered ratio highlight registration predictions
as Stanford enters its sixtieth academic year
Monday.
The class of '54 enters Stanford 1,084 strong,

topping by 121 last year's record of
963 freshmen. Boys make up 716 of
the new students, and girls 368, a
ratio of 2.85 to 1, a marked decrease
from the famous 3.2:1 which stood
since 1947. The enrollment of more
women than predicted, plus the fa<:t
that more women were accepted than
before because less men applied, ac
| accounts for the ratio increase.
Dormitory space for women will bo
at a premium because of the increase,

of many women who entered this

! critical situation in the women's
housing area.
