# Sterling Greets Newest Class
## 
### 
(President Sterling arrived at
Stanford April 1, 1949, and was
officially inaugurated the follow
ing October. He is Stanford's
fifth president, succeeding the
late Dr. Donald B. Tresidder. Dr.
Sterling came to Stanford from
Huntington Library, where he
was director. He was research
assistant for Hoover Library from
1932 to 1937, and received his
Doctor's degree in history here in
193 H. The president's office is
10 on the Inner Quad.)
I take pleasure in welcoming to
Stanford University what is to be
the Class of '54.
By the time you read this we
shall have already been introduced
to each other in the Frost Amphi
theater. As I told you on that oc
casion, we shall have opportunities
to become better acquainted. And
that is as it should be.
One of the important media
through which all members of the
Stanford Family become better ac
quainted is The Stanford Daily. As
you will discover, it is at once a
source of information about Stan
ford affairs and a forum for the
exchange of ideas and opinion. So
I am delighted to respond to The
Daily's invitation to use its columns
once more to extend greetings and
to wish you well.


DR. WALLACE STERLING
â€”Stanford President
