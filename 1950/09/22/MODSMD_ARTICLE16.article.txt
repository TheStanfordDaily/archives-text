### 
BERLIN, Sept. 21 (UP)â€”British
and Russian troops with rifles and
machineguns dug in tonight on op
posite sides of a disputed border in
tersection in Berlin's western out
skirts after two days of negotiations
failed to settle the affair.
As huge Kleig lights shone on the
contested area, located between
Potsdam and the British - operated
Gatow Airfield, Soviet tanks were
reported jockeying through the
neighboring woods.
The British commandant, Maj.
Gen. Geoffrey K. Bourne, dis
patched a stiff protest to Soviet
Commissioner Sergei A. Dengin
demanding withdrawal of the Rus
sian troops from the road block
they set up just inside the British
sector yesterday.
Meanwhlie the Russians released
two American military policemen
seized at gunpoint yesterday near
the American-Soviet zonal border.
The two siad they were held 13
hours without food or water.
Communist police announced to
night that four of their women po
lice who had been under arrest in
West Berlin were set free and as ;i
result four West German police also
were released. It was reported that
Germans still hold at least 51 Rus
sian sector police, while the East
Germans kept at least 22 West Ger
man police in custody.
As night closed in the disputed
border area, located in what nor
mally is a remote part of the city,
stood out like a spotlighted stage.
British "Tommies" dug foxholes
in the woods overlooking the in
tersection and posted sentries alonn
the road nearby. A few yards away,
grim Sussian soldiers did the same.
