To the new freshman men:
As a new member of the Stanford
Family, you enter the University
with one of the largest classes ever
to be admitted. Because of this size
it may appear to some of you that
we will not have as great an oppor
tunity, as members of the staff, to
learn to know you. Let me assure
you that we are vitally interested
in each one of you as individuals
and hop" to learn to know you as
soon as possible.
You have hard much and will hear
more about the Stanford Family and
the Stanford Spirit. This is not an in
tangible as it takes effect at your first
welcoming when the train pulls into
the station. Stanford men and women
pride themselves not only on the
"winds of freedom" but the fact that
there is close cooperation between
ihe staff of the University and the
Associated Student Body.
The organization of the Pre-Reg
istration and Orientation Program
that you have attended is the result
of student initiative and student or
ganization. I am sure you will agree
that every effort has been made to
introduce you to the entire Univer
sity as soon as possible. I express
my thanks, and I am sure yours, to
the great effort that has been made
by the Associated Student Body on
your behalf.
I would like to express the feeling
of the entire Counselor for Men's
Office in saying we look forward to

the opportunity to serve you and the
faculty of the University to help in
making your experience at Stanford
both in the classroom and cxtra
eurriculr-wise, a more profitable one.
