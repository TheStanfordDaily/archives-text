# UN to Make Decision On Crossing Parallel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 — The
United Nations, not the U.S. gov
ernment, will decide whether
American troops and other UN sol
diers in Korea pursue North Ko
rcna Communists across the 38th
parallel, President Truman said to
day.
He made clear at a press confer
ence that the UN must make the
vital decision on its troops will do
once they reach the parallel—the
dividing line between South Ko
rea and Communist North Korea.
The South Korean government has
said it wants the boundary crossed.
Mr. Truman was asked whether
he had reached any decision on
what the U.S. troops would do.
After saying that he had not, be
cause American forces are only a
part of the UN armies, he promised
the troops would abide by any UN
decision.
