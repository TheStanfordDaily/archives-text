This picture shows what Standard of Cali
fornia has spent, since the war, on facilities
needed to bring you more and better petro
leum products ... and to compete with other
oil companies in this extremely competitive
business.
But... what else has this money accom
plished?
It has helped every community in the West
... created jobs in many industries and made
those of our own people better. The money
has spread to other businesses, large and
small, and to every profession. Homes have
been built, automobiles purchased, educa
tions planned and started for many of the
West's young people.
We point this out to show how big com
panies make money work for everyone. And,
certainly, the public must share the credit...
for the public alone can make a company big.
Over the years, you have found Standard

products good and have bought more and
more of them. You've made us grow. A large
share of our profits each year is turned back
into the tools which mean still better prod
ucts and more efficient service for you. And,
perhaps even more important today, the tools
which give much added strength to our nation.
