# To Veto Red Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON —President Tru
man will veto the Communist con
trol bill tomorrow with a strongly
•voided message to Congress.
The message was being drafted at
the White House today. Despite
please from Democratic Congres
sional leaders that he sign the po
litically hot measure, Mr. Truman
will denounce it as unconstitutional
and a threat to American liberties.
Barring a sharp shift in senti
ment, Congress is certain to enact
it over his veto.
