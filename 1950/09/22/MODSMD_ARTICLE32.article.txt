# The 						Real Stanford Handshake
## 
### 
Freshmen, we'd like to have you meet Stan
ford.
You'll hear the stereotyped words of endless
introductions during the first days on the Farm,
but the greatest thrill will come when you meet
the real Stanford.
It isn't one of those personalities you meet
with a brief handshake, or one of those abbre
viated conversations you strike up at the Jolly
up, or even one of those vacant looks you give
your equally vacant room in Encina or Roble.
The Stanford which you meet will be a com
bination c traditions, memories, and experi
ences which have spread as the real roots of the
Stanford family tree.
The thrills of Big Game festivities, the echo
ing strainjs of "Where the Rolling Foothills
Rise," the sunny days up at the Boathouse, and
the green rsetting of Frost Amphitheater at the
Spring Sing.
These are the things you can't meet during
this first None of us completely get to
know Stanford until the June of our senior year
rolls around and we give the tassels on our
caps one flip.
To help the new class of '54 meet Stanford
and take its place as the youngest in the Stan
ford family, the pre-registration committee has
prepared an introductory program designed to
give you the "feel of the Farm."
Later next week there will be a chance for
you to sign up for any one of a whole list of
activities or clubs. There will be some who
will want to concentrate on that tough biology
lab and there will be others who will spend

much of their time in extracurricular activities
—much as they did in high school.
Music, drama, publications, religious organi
zations, athletics, service clubs, debate, hobby
groups, and political life—there's a spot some
where for everyone.
From day to day as you become better ac
quainted with Stanford, you will probably pick
out things that will help you answer your par
ents' inevitable question, "How do you like it
down on the Farm?"
Freshmen get the same question every year.
But their answers differ widely.
Some say it's that motto "Die Luft der Frei
heit weht," the heritage which continues to be
expressed in the Honor Code and in the Funda
mental Standard.
Very few other college freshmen can go
home at Thanksgiving and tell about their first
midterm, which was not proctored by any
teacher. „
Others maintain the best recommendation
for Stanford is the advantages it has of both a
small school and a large university.
Seldom is an institution closely knit enough
so dormitories, Row houses, and school facili
ties are within easy reach of each other. On the
other hand, there are few large universities with
faculties as distinguished as Stanford's.
All this is yours. Each new freshman class is
the cement which builds on to the prestige and
honor of the Farm—and all it stands for.
This is why everyone wants you to meet the
real Stanford—with a handshake that will last
forever.
