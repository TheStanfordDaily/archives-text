# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
TO THE FROSH
No waterbag throwing at Encina, girls have to be in
their hall at such-and-such a time, the history of the
Quad is such-and-such, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.
Already, facts and rules of all sizes, colors and de
scriptions have been bombarded at you 54ers, and the
assault will continue l'elentlessly.
To relieve the strain, Bull Session has prepared a
brief resume of what every freshman should know.
Forget what the others tell you.
1. When you see a line, quick, get in it. At Stanford
you have to stand in line for certificates, books, meals,
tickets, games, registration, and everything else
worthwhile and worthless. Consequently, when you
see a line, get in it, and ask questions later.
2. Important!! Take Physics 2278. You may look
through your announcement of courses folder and
perhaps may not find Physics 2278. This is because
it is not there. Physics 2278, "The Methods and Tech
niques of Water bagging," is strictly underground.
It will be taught by your Bull Sessioner for all those
who want to send a water bag to its destination with
pinpoint accuracy. This course is especially recom
mended to Encina men. Classes will be held Tues
day a >d Thursday at 10:30 p.m. on the top of Hoover
Tower; bring your own water bags and slide rules.

3. Take out some old National Geographies and get
acquainted with the history and topography of Korea.
Uncle Sam may give some of the men an expenses
paid visit.
4. Don't feel badly if you have flunked the English
A test. Herbert Hoover flunked it twice, an4,look what
became of him.
5. Memorize these facts:
A. It takes 1,561 steps to walk from Encina to
Roble.
B. Nine out of ten women are beautiful, and the
tenth goes to Stanford.
C. It takes 1,561 steps to run from Roble back to
Encina. i
D. A water bag coming from the fifth floor of
Encina has more velocity than one coming
from the second floor.
E. There are 272 lights on the ceiling of Memorial
Auditorium. ,
You may gripe at having to learn the exact numbers,
but it will put you in practice for Biology tests in
which they may ask you a specific number of chromo
somes found under sub-footnote C in the textbook.
6. Finally—and this is important—buy a Rose Bowl
tie and make reservations in Pasadena for New Years,
because, chums, it's our turn to go to the Rose Bowl.

Quad is such-and-such, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.
Already, facts and rules of all sizes, colors and de
scriptions have been bombarded at you 54ers, and the
assault will continue l'elentlessly.
To relieve the strain, Bull Session has prepared a
brief resume of what every freshman should know.
Forget what the others tell you.
1. When you see a line, quick, get in it. At Stanford
you have to stand in line for certificates, books, meals,
tickets, games, registration, and everything else
worthwhile and worthless. Consequently, when you
see a line, get in it, and ask questions later.
2. Important!! Take Physics 2278. You may look
through your announcement of courses folder and
perhaps may not find Physics 2278. This is because
it is not there. Physics 2278, "The Methods and Tech
niques of Water bagging," is strictly underground.
It will be taught by your Bull Sessioner for all those
who want to send a water bag to its destination with
pinpoint accuracy. This course is especially recom
mended to Encina men. Classes will be held Tues
day a >d Thursday at 10:30 p.m. on the top of Hoover
Tower; bring your own water bags and slide rules.

3. Take out some old National Geographies and get
acquainted with the history and topography of Korea.
Uncle Sam may give some of the men an expenses
paid visit.
4. Don't feel badly if you have flunked the English
A test. Herbert Hoover flunked it twice, an4,look what
became of him.
5. Memorize these facts:
A. It takes 1,561 steps to walk from Encina to
Roble.
B. Nine out of ten women are beautiful, and the
tenth goes to Stanford.
C. It takes 1,561 steps to run from Roble back to
Encina. i
D. A water bag coming from the fifth floor of
Encina has more velocity than one coming
from the second floor.
E. There are 272 lights on the ceiling of Memorial
Auditorium. ,
You may gripe at having to learn the exact numbers,
but it will put you in practice for Biology tests in
which they may ask you a specific number of chromo
somes found under sub-footnote C in the textbook.
6. Finally—and this is important—buy a Rose Bowl
tie and make reservations in Pasadena for New Years,
because, chums, it's our turn to go to the Rose Bowl.
TO THE FROSH
No waterbag throwing at Encina, girls have to be in
their hall at such-and-such a time, the history of the
Quad is such-and-such, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.

scriptions have been bombarded at you 54ers, and the
