# Fundamental Standard, Honor Code Rule Farm
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
From now until diploma day, the
new Stanford student will hear
much about the Honor Code and
the Fundamental Standard. In re
lation to his studies and exams, the
student will find the Code staring
him in the face at every turn, and
he will sooi. jme to appreciate the
feeling of freedom it gives him.
New students will hear a lot
about the Honor Code before the
next week is over. The student will
sign the Code in his registration
book and again during cach exam
ination period.
The Honor Code works at Stan
ford because the students them
selves want it to work. The term
"Honor Code" is not an empty shell
in meaning as it is at many schools.
Instead, it is a well-founded and
lime-tested p'jP whereby the stu
dent may carry on his academic
work in an atmosphere of honesty
and without proctoring.
Faculty Co-operation
Members of the faculty recognize
the significance and effectiveness of
the Code and co-operate with the
students in maintaining it.
The Honor Code dates back more
than a quarter of a century. It was
first tried in the Law School, and
gradually adopted at both graduate
and undergraduate levels through
out, the University.
An Honor Code Committee is ap
pointed cach year to increase the
effectiveness of the Code and to in
doctrinate new students as to its
meaning. At the present, the com
mittee is functioning without a
chairman, since Wayne Alley,
chairman this summer, is not re
turning to school this fall.
Student's Role
Full responsibility for the suc
cess of the Honor Code lies with
the student. It works because the

students themselves are alert to re
port violations to the professor or
student council.
The Fundamental Standard is a
broader concept. Its basic principle
is that Stanford women and men act
as ladies and gentlemen at all times
wherever they may be. Students
who get into trouble either on or
off campus may expect to be prose
cuted by the student councils under
this principle.
Enforcement
All violations of the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard are
handled by the Men's and Women's
Councils. These groups have full
power to dismiss students from the
University if the violation warrants.
All decisions are subject to, and al
most always receive, the approval
of tho Dean of Students.
Students in doubt about the full
meaning or workings of the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard
should consult the Stanford Hand
book, their resident assistant or
sponsor, or a member of the Honor
Code Committee. No student can
expect leniency in judgment be
cause of ignorance of these two
concepts which have become an in
tegral part of Stanford.

cause of ignorance of these two
concepts which have become an in
tegral part of Stanford.
From now until diploma day, the
new Stanford student will hear
much about the Honor Code and
the Fundamental Standard. In re
lation to his studies and exams, the
student will find the Code staring
him in the face at every turn, and
he will sooi. jme to appreciate the
feeling of freedom it gives him.
New students will hear a lot
about the Honor Code before the
next week is over. The student will
sign the Code in his registration
book and again during cach exam
ination period.
The Honor Code works at Stan
ford because the students them
selves want it to work. The term
"Honor Code" is not an empty shell
in meaning as it is at many schools.
Instead, it is a well-founded and
lime-tested p'jP whereby the stu
dent may carry on his academic
work in an atmosphere of honesty
and without proctoring.
Faculty Co-operation
Members of the faculty recognize
the significance and effectiveness of
the Code and co-operate with the
students in maintaining it.
The Honor Code dates back more
than a quarter of a century. It was
first tried in the Law School, and
gradually adopted at both graduate
and undergraduate levels through
out, the University.
An Honor Code Committee is ap
pointed cach year to increase the
effectiveness of the Code and to in
doctrinate new students as to its
meaning. At the present, the com
mittee is functioning without a
chairman, since Wayne Alley,
chairman this summer, is not re
turning to school this fall.
Student's Role
Full responsibility for the suc
cess of the Honor Code lies with
the student. It works because the

students themselves are alert to re
port violations to the professor or
student council.
The Fundamental Standard is a
broader concept. Its basic principle
is that Stanford women and men act
as ladies and gentlemen at all times
wherever they may be. Students
who get into trouble either on or
off campus may expect to be prose
cuted by the student councils under
this principle.
Enforcement
All violations of the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard are
handled by the Men's and Women's
Councils. These groups have full
power to dismiss students from the
University if the violation warrants.
All decisions are subject to, and al
most always receive, the approval
of tho Dean of Students.
Students in doubt about the full
meaning or workings of the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard
should consult the Stanford Hand
book, their resident assistant or
sponsor, or a member of the Honor
Code Committee. No student can
expect leniency in judgment be
cause of ignorance of these two
concepts which have become an in
tegral part of Stanford.
