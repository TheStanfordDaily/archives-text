# Engineers to Get Weatherill Medals
## 
### 
Two Stanford research engineers,
Dr. Russell Varian and Sigurd F.
Varian, have been named to receive
John Price Weatherill Medals by
the Franklin Institute of the State
fo Pennsylvania for their work in
developing a new kind of radio
tube widely used in World War 11.
The two brothers, who began re
search here in 1933, made possible
speedier development of micro
wave radio equipment with their
new device. The tube, called the
klystron, has also made it possible
to transmit telephone conversations
over long distances without using
wires.
The klystron was developed in a
Physics Department laboratory
here when the Varians were re
search associates. Russell Varian,
president of Varian Associates,
graduated from Stanford in 1925.
He is still a Stanford Research As
sociate. His brother, Sigurd, grad
uated from Cal Poly at San Luis
Obispo, where he specialized in avi
ation.
Both men will receive their
award at ceremonies October 18 at
the Franklin Institute.
