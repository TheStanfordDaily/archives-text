# Armor-Coated Campus Roads Open for Game
## 
### 
Triffic is expected to flow over the
newly resurfaced roads near Croth
ers and Stern Halls tomorrow—for
a limited time at least — Superin
tendent of Buildings and Grounds
Carroll Blacker said yesterday as
he acted to avert a possible traffic
tieup at the San Jose - Stanford
game.
Although the temporary surface
is only an armor coat, he pointed
out, it will be good enough so visi
tors won't have to drive through
the fields back of Branner Hall to
get to the Stadium.
The job was expected to be com
pleted by the first part of this week,
but it was slowed up when the sub
grade layer did not pass specifica
tions, Blacker said.
However, road tests have been
accepted now and the armor coat
was to be completed today. Next
week Blacker anticipates the com
pletion of the asphalt topping.
General contractor is Peter So
rensen of Redwood City. His crews
have been working on the resur
facing job about a month.
When the project is completed,
Blacker explained, the asphalt sur
face will extend from Toyon to
Stern Hall on Escondido Street and
from the south end of Stern to En
cina Hall on Galvez Street. Several
of the intersections required grad
ing and a new surface to prevent
a bump in the street at the point*
where the new asphalt areas join
on to other black-top streets.
Blacker asked the co-operation of
students driving in the construction
area, by not running through the
roadblocks. He said the entire jot
might be slowed down considerably
if cars drive on the surface before
it is completely rolled and hardened
for general use.

any drivers "running the road
blocks will be subject to heavy
penalties."
