# Davis Summarizes Parking Regulations
## 
### 
Parking restrictions will be
strictly enforced this year because
of the great number of automobiles
and the limited amount of space on
campus, Police Chief Gordon Davis
said yesterday.
Last year more than 4,000 cars
belonging to students, faculty, and
employees were registered by the
Stanford Police Department, Davis
pointed out. Parking problems will
be minimized, he said, if students
living on campus will walk to class
and leave the available spaces for
students commuting from off-cam
pus areas.
Student drivers arc not allowed
to park in areas marked "reserved
parking," the police chief said, ex
cept on Saturdays, Sundays, or at
night.

Students attending the San
Jose game tomorrow at the Sta
dium are urged to walk because
of the road detours in the area
near the Stadium. Davis said if
cars are left at home by campus
fans, there will be no bottleneck
before and after the game for
visiting spectators and guests on
the Farm.

In summarizing traffic regula
tions, Davis said, the regular speed
limits of 20 miles per hour on cam
pus and 25 miles per hour on roads
leading into campus are still in ef
fect.
Fines for speeding are 50 cents
per mile for all speeds above the
>peed limit on the first offense. The
penalty goes up to 75 cents on the
second offense and $1 on the third
offense. A fourth citation automati
cally bars the person from operat
ing an automobile on campus, Chief
Davis added.
All parking violations are sub
ject to a $2 fine.
Stop signs have been placed at
the intersections which have "prov
-3n dangerous," Davis said, and a
>mall accident toll will depend on
the co-operation of all Stanford
motorists.
A new traffic restriction institut
ed this fall is the closing of Duena
Street, just east of the Corporation
Yard, for through traffic. Parking
is not allowed behind the Union
kitchen, and only Corporation Yard
equipment and cars belonging to
employees are permitted on the
street.
