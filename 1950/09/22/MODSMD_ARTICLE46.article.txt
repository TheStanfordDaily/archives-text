first time in Frost Amphitheater yes
terday afternoon and told them to
survey all the possibilities and make
the most of the advantages offered

He eluded the men of '54 on their
record tallness, and told the class as
a whole that the Stanford students,
faeidty, and alumni formed a
smoothly running machine by work
ing together to settle their differ
ences.
From Ted Buttner, student body
president, the new students learned
as fact the tradition that they were
already feeling—that the freshman
class is given a friendly and enthusi
astic welcome instead of the first
year hazing found on other cam
puses.
Farm's Founding
Buttner wtnt on to tell the fresh
men the history of the founding of
the University — how the Leland
Stanfords built it a memorial to their
son, Leland Jr., that the children of
California could be their children.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win

bigler and Chief Counselors Miss
Elva F. Brown and Richard L. Balch
were introduced. Yells were led by
Yell Leader Pete Henderson.
The first day welcome began at 6
a.m. as members of the Pre-Reg com
mittee met the Los Angeles Starlight
at the Palo Alto station and gave
sleepy-eyed and amazed frosh a ride
to the University. Throughout the
day, as the frosh. got off at the ban
ner-bedecked station, they were
driven to their new homes in red
streamered cars.
Women Upstairs
Freshmen driving to the University
stopped at the booth on the traffic
island at the Palm Drive entrance to
receive directions.
Encina presented a mob scene by
mid-morning as freshmen, parents
and relatives milled through the
dorm while workmen calmly moved
a heavy safe across the lobby at
snail's pace. Somewhat concerned
about the women in the inner sanc
tum, one sponsor shrugged his
shoulders and said, "We're supposed
to keep them out, I guess, but there's
nothing you can do . . ."
The frosh ate their first college
meal at noon and were officially re
ceived and greeted by the Adminis
tration in the Amphitheater at 4:30.
Last night, loaded with questions,
they descended upon their sponsors
to get a straight start in the college
that is the object of 12 long years of
preparatory education.
