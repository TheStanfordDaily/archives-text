Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson)
was one of those who tumbled to the
bottom when sound came in, an
aging glamour queen living in a
world of illusion, with no company
but a couple of million dollars.
Hopelessly entangled with her and
her ambitions for a comeback is Joe

writer out of work, who pulls into
Norma's driveway to escape the fi
nance company and stays to feed her
self-esteem and become her lover.
Living in a decaying mansion tilled
with the exotic splendor of the 'twen
ties, Norma Desmond spins a web for
new stardom, but the web is too fra
gile and breaks, tearing with it the
soft silk of her illusions, that screened
out the harshness of reality.
Gloria Sv/anson creats the sccret
world of Norma Desmond with ex

equaled by William Holden and Erich
von Stroheim in the other leading
roles.
"Sunset Boulevard" is not an eve

who split up at the film's close.
