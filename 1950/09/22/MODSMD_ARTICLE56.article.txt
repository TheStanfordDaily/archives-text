## Cardinal Close-ups 
### 
Welcome to the class of "54! By the hustle and enthusiasm shown at the
first few frosh grid workouts this week, it looks like this year's freshman
team again will be one that the entire school will be proud of.
Among those men practicing on the freshman field today may be a future
Ernie Nevers, a Bobby Grayson or a Frankie Albert who will go down in
sports history with the many Stanford gridiron greats.
Stanford has had a glorious football history which has extended over a
period of nearly 60 years. Coached by such outstanding men as Walter
Camp, Hurry-Up Yost, Pop Warner, and Clark Shaughnessy, Stanford has
amassed a grand total of 243 wins against 105 defeats and 33 ties.
The Cards have represented the PCC in the Rose Bowl seven times, and
have a 23 to 21 edge in their annual Big Game series with California.
Indians Start Rebuilding
But what of Stanford's post-war elevens? The Cards have slowly been
building up their gridiron strength since 1946 when they resumed football
after a three-year World War layoff.
Though the other PCC schools had at least a year's head start on the In
dians, Coach Marchie Schwartz's 1946 squad, led by fullback Lloyd Merri
rnan, came through with a respectable G won, 3 lost and 1 tied record, which
included a convincing 25 to 6 victory at Berkeley. There was no freshman
team that year.
In the 1947 grid opener, an underdog Idaho team came down to Stanford
Stadium and muzzled the Indians, 19 to 16. The stunning upset previewed
what was to be the most disastrous footi:all season in Stanford history—no
victories and nine defeats.
But the '47 team didn't give up without a great fight. Ten to one and 30-
underdogs against mighty California, the Card team that hadn't won
a game nearly provided the biggest upset in Big Game history, losing
finally on a last-minute touchdown pass, 21 to 18. However, the first post
war freshman team that year, under Coach Chuck Taylor, was undefeated.
Conversion trouble again plagued the Indians in 1948 as the Cards lost to
their two biggest rivals, USC and California, by identical scores of 7 to 6.
Though they scored more points than their opponents, the '48 team ended
up with a record of four v/ins and six losses. But the frosh, led by such
stars as Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian, and Bill McColl, again rolled
through their season without a defeat.
Tide Changes for Stanford
The 1949 Big Rod Machine, ltd by material from two undefeated fresh
man teams, piled up the greatest number of points in Stanford grid history
—•366 against theii opponents' 121. The season was highlighted by a 34 to
13 scalping of USC in the Coliseum, marking the first time in ten years that
a PCC team had benten the Trojans by more than one touchdown. For the
third straight year, Coach Taylor guided the Stanford yearlings to an unde
feated season.
That brings us to the present grid campaign. Pre-season experts have
tabbed Stanford as "the team to boat" on the Pacific Coast this season. And
why do these experts pick Stanford? It is mostly because nearly every
member of the 1950 Stanford varsity has been on an undefeated freshman
team.
The stars of the freshman team today will be the varsity stars of tomor
row. Can you keep up the good record?

team that year.
In the 1947 grid opener, an underdog Idaho team came down to Stanford
Stadium and muzzled the Indians, 19 to 16. The stunning upset previewed
what was to be the most disastrous footi:all season in Stanford history—no
victories and nine defeats.
But the '47 team didn't give up without a great fight. Ten to one and 30-
underdogs against mighty California, the Card team that hadn't won
a game nearly provided the biggest upset in Big Game history, losing
finally on a last-minute touchdown pass, 21 to 18. However, the first post
war freshman team that year, under Coach Chuck Taylor, was undefeated.
Conversion trouble again plagued the Indians in 1948 as the Cards lost to
their two biggest rivals, USC and California, by identical scores of 7 to 6.
Though they scored more points than their opponents, the '48 team ended
up with a record of four v/ins and six losses. But the frosh, led by such
stars as Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian, and Bill McColl, again rolled
through their season without a defeat.
Tide Changes for Stanford
The 1949 Big Rod Machine, ltd by material from two undefeated fresh
man teams, piled up the greatest number of points in Stanford grid history
—•366 against theii opponents' 121. The season was highlighted by a 34 to
13 scalping of USC in the Coliseum, marking the first time in ten years that
a PCC team had benten the Trojans by more than one touchdown. For the
third straight year, Coach Taylor guided the Stanford yearlings to an unde
feated season.
That brings us to the present grid campaign. Pre-season experts have
tabbed Stanford as "the team to boat" on the Pacific Coast this season. And
why do these experts pick Stanford? It is mostly because nearly every
member of the 1950 Stanford varsity has been on an undefeated freshman
team.
The stars of the freshman team today will be the varsity stars of tomor
row. Can you keep up the good record?
Welcome to the class of "54! By the hustle and enthusiasm shown at the
first few frosh grid workouts this week, it looks like this year's freshman
team again will be one that the entire school will be proud of.
Among those men practicing on the freshman field today may be a future
Ernie Nevers, a Bobby Grayson or a Frankie Albert who will go down in
sports history with the many Stanford gridiron greats.
Stanford has had a glorious football history which has extended over a
period of nearly 60 years. Coached by such outstanding men as Walter
Camp, Hurry-Up Yost, Pop Warner, and Clark Shaughnessy, Stanford has
amassed a grand total of 243 wins against 105 defeats and 33 ties.
The Cards have represented the PCC in the Rose Bowl seven times, and
have a 23 to 21 edge in their annual Big Game series with California.
Indians Start Rebuilding
But what of Stanford's post-war elevens? The Cards have slowly been
building up their gridiron strength since 1946 when they resumed football
after a three-year World War layoff.
Though the other PCC schools had at least a year's head start on the In
dians, Coach Marchie Schwartz's 1946 squad, led by fullback Lloyd Merri
rnan, came through with a respectable G won, 3 lost and 1 tied record, which
included a convincing 25 to 6 victory at Berkeley. There was no freshman
team that year.
