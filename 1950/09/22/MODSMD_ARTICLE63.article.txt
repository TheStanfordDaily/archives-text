## The 						Stanford Daily New Water Polo Rules To Aid Swimmers 
### 
With the advent of the South
American rules, Coach Tom Haynie
stands a good chance of raising his
water polo team out of the third
place spot they landed last year
in the PCC.
The new rules change the game
from a slow, whistle-happy, hockey
type game, to a fast-breaking, bas
ketball-like sport. The rules abolish
the old sprint after every goal; the
goalie scored upon puts the ball in
play. Also, when the whistle blows
lor a foul, only the two players in
volved have to stop. Thus, the rest
of the players can break and attempt
to get clear.
The rules call for a longer game,
28 minutes, with more swimming,
which will benefit Stanford's type of
offense.
The Cards lost only three first
stringers out of seven by graduation:
Ralph Sala, Ken Fox, and Kim
Fletcher, and have returning Bob
Frojen, Ernie Polte, Hub Stokely, and
Don Weeden. The big loss was
Fletcher, the only experienced goalie
on the squad last year. Haynie must
find a replacement from Marsh
Pearlman, a senior this year, Russ
LaTelle, a junior, and Jerry Van

Bergen, a soph.
Ailer Frojen, who played on the
national champion Whittier team this
summer, Polte, and Stokely, Haynie
will have about 10 players to choose
from for the three remaining spots.
These include last year's second
string, and the nucleus of the Frosh
team.
