# New Coach Bob Bronzan To Face Severe Schedule
## 
### 
One of the most youthful, but at
the same time one of the most tal
ented coaches in major football cir
! cles is Bob Bronzan, San Jose
State's new 31 - year - old gridiron
i genius.
Stepping into the shoes of Bill
Hubbard, v/ho has been moved up
to the newly created position of Di
rector of Athletics, Bronzan is faced
with the toughest schedule in Spar
tan history, meeting such teams as
j Stanford, Santa Clara, USF, Loyola,
St. Mary's, and COP.
Bronzan is well suited to the task
before him. He not only has been
one of the few coaches ever invited
;to attend a Frank Leahy spring
practice, but his talents as a top
scout have been employed by Notre
Dame and the local '49ers.
Bob started his football career at
Tehachapi High. Then he went to
i Modesto JC where he was an allâ€”
J conference center. Coming to San
Jose State, Bronzan nabbed honors
: as a tackle.
Following graduation, he went to
UCLA for a year's more education.
Livingston College employed him
as head coach in 1941. Then Uncle
Sam called Bronzan, and he became
a director of physical training in
| Mexico.
In 1946 Bronzan was discharged
| and immediately was appointed line
I coach at San Jose under Hubbard.
The Golden Raiders' strong lines in
the past years attest to his ability.
During summers he has contin
| ued his studies at Stanford and has
I just completed the M.A.
