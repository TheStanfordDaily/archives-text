## Midweek Musings 
### 
Those ardent proponents of the ancient art of crystal-gazing, the mahara
jas of the sports desks, have conjured some lovely visions this fall for the
Farm faithful. A .-.urvey of a number of national publications reveals the
1950 Stanford varsity to be clear-cut choice of the nation's, grid experts to
represent the Pacific Coast in this season's Tournament of the Roses.
Marchie Schwartz would be the first to recommend a few grains of salt to
aid the digestion of the following statistical tidbits; but here's the summary
for what it's worth:
Your reporter was able to discover only one pigskin preview which does
not see any ros< s in Stanford's future. PIC magazine was the offender, rank
ing (h;> Sons of the lt< <1 no better than third in the PCC race. USC and Cal
were rated better, in that order.
But all the other predictions were somewhat unbe'ievable to one who has
suffered through three consecutive Big Game defeats, one totally winless
season, and an endless string of moral victories.
Collier's Goes Overboard
Collier's mag, for example, certainly gains the nod as teamster of the
Stanford bandwagon. Not only does the distinguished (as of now) publi
cation pick the Indians as PCC champ; it further predicts that the Marchie
men will whip Michigan in the Rose Bowl and that towering Bill McColl
will become the first Stanford Ail-American since Fabulous Frankie.
Grantland Rice, the dean of contemporary sports writers, slates the In
dians for the nation's No. 5 spot in his recent LOOK roundup. Rice sees
Stanford tops on the Coast, with McColl. Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian,
and Tex White leading the way.
'l'he Saturday Evening Post also likes the Red for the Pasadena assign
ment, but ranks them only No. 8 nationally. In regard to the individual
stars, this magazine adds the name of speedster Bob White to those men
tioned by Look.
SmaSl Magazines Agree
All the above are, of course, large-circulation publications. But many of
the small sheets concui with their more powerful cousins. Sport Lite, for
instance, lists Stanford in its top ten in the country and No. 1 on the Coast.
Well, we'll see.

Bullseye Bill Sharman, the Trojan bounce-ball specialist who captured
the all-time PCC scoring mark last year by the margin of a free throw,
presently appears headed for a big league baseballing career with the
Brooklyn Dodgers.
Sharman, who was an outstanding star with Troy at both basketball and
baseball, departed the Trojan campus last April to join forces with the
Dodgers' Pueblo. Colorado, Class A form club. At Pueblo. Bill batted in
the . 320's most of the summer and further impressed the Bum moguls with
his speed and accurate throwing arm.
At last knowledge, Sharman was performing for Elmira, New York, an
other Dodger farm. According to the grapevine, the mid-season switch to
Elmira was caused by a front-office desire to have Sharman playing where
he could be more easily observed ty the parent club.
Incidentally, the Pueblo club lost 18 consecutive games immediately after
Sharman's transfer to Elmira!!!

dians for the nation's No. 5 spot in his recent LOOK roundup. Rice sees
Stanford tops on the Coast, with McColl. Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian,
and Tex White leading the way.
'l'he Saturday Evening Post also likes the Red for the Pasadena assign
ment, but ranks them only No. 8 nationally. In regard to the individual
stars, this magazine adds the name of speedster Bob White to those men
tioned by Look.
SmaSl Magazines Agree
All the above are, of course, large-circulation publications. But many of
the small sheets concui with their more powerful cousins. Sport Lite, for
instance, lists Stanford in its top ten in the country and No. 1 on the Coast.
Well, we'll see.

Bullseye Bill Sharman, the Trojan bounce-ball specialist who captured
the all-time PCC scoring mark last year by the margin of a free throw,
presently appears headed for a big league baseballing career with the
Brooklyn Dodgers.
Sharman, who was an outstanding star with Troy at both basketball and
baseball, departed the Trojan campus last April to join forces with the
Dodgers' Pueblo. Colorado, Class A form club. At Pueblo. Bill batted in
the . 320's most of the summer and further impressed the Bum moguls with
his speed and accurate throwing arm.
At last knowledge, Sharman was performing for Elmira, New York, an
other Dodger farm. According to the grapevine, the mid-season switch to
Elmira was caused by a front-office desire to have Sharman playing where
he could be more easily observed ty the parent club.
Incidentally, the Pueblo club lost 18 consecutive games immediately after
Sharman's transfer to Elmira!!!
Those ardent proponents of the ancient art of crystal-gazing, the mahara
jas of the sports desks, have conjured some lovely visions this fall for the
Farm faithful. A .-.urvey of a number of national publications reveals the
1950 Stanford varsity to be clear-cut choice of the nation's, grid experts to
represent the Pacific Coast in this season's Tournament of the Roses.
Marchie Schwartz would be the first to recommend a few grains of salt to
aid the digestion of the following statistical tidbits; but here's the summary
for what it's worth:
Your reporter was able to discover only one pigskin preview which does
not see any ros< s in Stanford's future. PIC magazine was the offender, rank
ing (h;> Sons of the lt< <1 no better than third in the PCC race. USC and Cal
were rated better, in that order.
But all the other predictions were somewhat unbe'ievable to one who has
suffered through three consecutive Big Game defeats, one totally winless
season, and an endless string of moral victories.
Collier's Goes Overboard
Collier's mag, for example, certainly gains the nod as teamster of the
Stanford bandwagon. Not only does the distinguished (as of now) publi
cation pick the Indians as PCC champ; it further predicts that the Marchie
men will whip Michigan in the Rose Bowl and that towering Bill McColl
will become the first Stanford Ail-American since Fabulous Frankie.
Grantland Rice, the dean of contemporary sports writers, slates the In
dians for the nation's No. 5 spot in his recent LOOK roundup. Rice sees
Stanford tops on the Coast, with McColl. Gary Kerkorian, Harry Hugasian,
and Tex White leading the way.
