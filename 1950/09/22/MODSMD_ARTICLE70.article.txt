# Cards Bold Clean Slate Against San Jose State
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
One-half as old as the State of California is the rivalry between
Stanford and San Jose State.
That's right; it all started back in 1900 and since then the two
Peninsula aggregations have met each other a total of seven times
with the Indians winning all seven.
This fact cannot be taken too seriously as up to the mid-'3o's
San Jose State was only a teachers' 1

college.
But in 1948, following a post-war
i bulge in attendance. San Jose nar
rowly missed upsetting a supposed
ly strong T-ba!ling Stanford squad,
2G to 20.
Started in 1!HK)
The series began 50 years ago
when a Stanford club under Field
ing Yost, of point-a-minute fame,
chalked up two shutout wins, 35-0
and 24-0.
Then 33 years went by before
San Jose and Stanford met again.
And this time it was the Golden
Raiders' misfortune to run up
against Stanford's Golden Era of
football, the Vowing Sophomores of
1933-34-35.
Led by Grayson, Hamilton, Top
ping, and many other Card grid
; immortals, the Indians waltzed into
| the Rose Bowl three consecutive
I years.
During their reign of mastery of

the Coast, the Cards, under Tiny
i Thornhill, played cat and mouse
with the Spartans winning three
I shutouts, 27-0. 48-0, 35-0.
Then came 1948, and following a
winless '47 campaign, the Indians
opened the season confident of a
J win over their neighbors to the
j south.
Cards Behind 20 to 0
The Golc'en Raiders, under men
tor Bill Hubbard, and led by Bill
Parton, Pete Denevi, Fred Man
gini, Mel Stein, and George Keene,
j scored 20 points against the listless
Injuns in the first half and allowed
them only three yards from rush
! ing.
Wearing down San Jose State in
the second half as so many oppo
, nents have done to Stanford, the
Indians overcame the deficit and
with good breaks eked out a 26-20
win.
The game was in doubt until with
; three minutes to go, Card guard
i Jack McKittrick stole the ball from
Spartan quarterback Chuck Hughes
and raced 35 yards for a TD and a
lineman's dream to save the day
for Stanford.
Previous to this, Card end Bob
Ghilotti blocked and recovered a
punt to knot the count.
That game marks the only time
San Jose State has scored in the
seven tilts to date.
TD Parade in '49
Last year the Indians previewed
the University's highest scoring
team in history to the Spartans, to
the tune of 49-0 in the opening
track meet. However, the Golden
Raiders wound up with an eight
and four record and went on to
I edge Texas Tech in the Raisin
Bowl, 20-13.
Now, highly respected by inde—
| pendents. Coach Bob Bronzan will
i lead his '50 gold and white warriors
1 into Stanford Stadium in hopes of
j upsetting the pre-season dope.
Stanford has amassed 244 points
while San Jose State has been held
i to 20.

One-half as old as the State of California is the rivalry between
Stanford and San Jose State.
That's right; it all started back in 1900 and since then the two
Peninsula aggregations have met each other a total of seven times
with the Indians winning all seven.
This fact cannot be taken too seriously as up to the mid-'3o's
San Jose State was only a teachers' 1

college.

when a Stanford club under Field

chalked up two shutout wins, 35-0
and 24-0.
Then 33 years went by before
San Jose and Stanford met again.
And this time it was the Golden
Raiders' misfortune to run up
against Stanford's Golden Era of
football, the Vowing Sophomores of
1933-34-35.
Led by Grayson, Hamilton, Top
ping, and many other Card grid

During their reign of mastery of

Then came 1948, and following a

opened the season confident of a
