# Menges, Wilson Lead Light Spartan Squad
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
San Jose State optns a major 10-
game schedule tomorrow boasting a
team that is strictly a question
mark. Newly appointed Head Coach
Bob Bronzan is banking heavily on
the services of 2G sophomores to fill
the shoes of 20 departed letter men.
Any strength in depth will de
pend upon untried junior college
transfers. On the brighter side is
the return of 17 veterans. However,
only two were starters last fall,
quarterback Gene Menges and end
Billy Wilson.
This year's Spartan line is heav
ier, although it lacks the experience
of former Golden Raider forward
walls.
Coach Bronzan's backfield of
Menges, Buddy Traina, Gil Men
donsa, and Harry Beck averages
only IGS pounds, with few heavier
replacements.
Menges Tops
Menges should have a great year.
The Magician, as his mates cull him,
was the top Western passer last
year. He had a record of 99 com
pletions out of lb2 attempts for
1,490 yards and 1G touchdowns.
Mendonsa, a good blocker, tack
ier, and runner at 150 pounds,
should be the mainstay of the
ground attack. Running assistance
will come from veterans A 1 Cemen
tina, Beck, and newcomers Bill
Walker, Wayne Buck, Orland Di-
Ciccio, Bob Osborne, and Frank
Morriss.
Wilson is the line standout. Not
only a great pass receiver, he is

also a top blocker and defensive
man. Last season he was on the
receiving end of 24 passes good ior
325 yards and three scores.
Tackle Twins â€¢' '
John Lankas, G ft. 2 in. and 191
pounds, will be at the other end.
The Spartans iiave a set of twins
at the tackle spots in Jim and Joe
Moulton, j.c. transfers. Guards Dick
Harding and Carl DcSalvo are both
heavy and aggressive. Letterman
Dick Carpenter opens at center.
Backing up the seven starters in
the forward wall are ends Clarence
Ore, Stu Compton, and Jerry Per
ich; tackles Ed Miller and Jim
Wheelehan; guard George Porter;
centers Tom CufTe and Fran Klue
wer.
The Golden Raiders have no sea
sonal captain. However, the squad
elected four team representatives
to perform field duties and to keep
morale high. They are Menges,
Wilson, Osborne, and Compton.
Coach Bronzan's Spartans oper
ate from a T with the possibility
of some sp!it-T plays be ; ng slipped
