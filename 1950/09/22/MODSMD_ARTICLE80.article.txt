# Quick-Moving Reg Lines Bring Back Old Memories
## 
### 
New students will find that
Lhey can whisk through he paper
work of registration with a mini
mum of time and effort this year,
and old students should finish up
the job of registering in well under
a half-hour.
The present registration plan was
set up by H. Donald Winbigler, for
mer registrar and now Dean of
Students, ft was put into effect in
September, 1948, a year after the
Big Rush.
The Big Rush occurred on Sep
tember 29, 1947, when a proportion
of 8,200 descended upon the Uni
versity, sending previous enroll
ment estimates and records into a
tailspin. Students stood for hours
in lines which wove through the
old Administration Building (now
the Law School Building) and
trailed around the Quad to Engi
neering corner. Many waited four
to six hours in line for one seat
card, a rectangular piece of col
ored cardboard admitting the stu
dent to class, now replaced by the
class list system.
Members of the class of '51 start
ed lining up early for the Big Rush.
A description of their first-day ex
perience is found in the next morn
ing's issue of The Daily.
"Three freshmen spent the grave

yard shift on the doorsTep oi the
Administration Building yesterday
morning, assuring themselves first
places at the head of a line of 7,500
students which was predicts to
appear at the Registrar's window
(actually, 8,200 showed up.â€”ltd.).
"The three Encina men, D?rek
Bok, Skeets Peeler, and Tony Lie
big, took up the vigil at midnight
Sunday, and catnapped on blankets
and pillows while fellow freshmen
dozen in their own warm cots. Two
others, Raymond E. Williams and
Otis Sullivan, came in a close sec
ond at 12:02 a.m. The campers were
provided transportation to highway
breakfast huts by goodnatured ac
quaintances as dawn broke.
"First woman in line was Shirley
Preston, Robleite, who took up the
47th position in line six and a half
hours later. Miss Preston's break
fast consisted of an apple saved
from the Sunday snack. Two hun
dred more men followed the lone
coed before another freshman
woman appeared.
"With the line extending down
the entire east side of the Quad,
the doors were thrown open to the
crowd at 7:10 a.m. Spirits rose as
office lights glowed at 7:30, and the
first registration booklet was hand
j ed out at 8 a.m. on the nose by the
1 prompt registration assistants."
