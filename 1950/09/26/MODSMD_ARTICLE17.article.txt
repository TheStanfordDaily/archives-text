Stanford's highly-touted Indians,
who showed only flashes of brilliance
:n their 33 to 16 victory over San
Jose State, went through a spirited
workout yesterday in preparation for j
their Saturday battle with Coach Joe j

| on their timing which was so sadly
lacking in the Spartan contest. Stan
ford received a grand total of 16 pen
alties Saturrlay, most of which wore

The varsity also worked on pass
defense, another Card sore spot seen
in the Spartan Game.
White Misses Practice
Tackle Gordy White, who received
a twisted ankle against Snn Jose,

I Barring any sudden mishap in

rrrjmmages this work, the Cards will i
bo at full strength when they run |
headon into USF's powerful Dons j
here Saturday.
Led by halfback Ollie Matson, 195
pounds of gridiron dynamite, the
H ill toppers rolled over a highly re
garded Tulsa eleven, 23 to 14, in
Kezar Sati'"' ninht.
The Dons have a versatile running
game this season, but even more im

attack. USFers Gene Sweeters and
and Ed Brown's pitching to Matson
may cause the Indians plenty of
headaches comc Saturday.
However, there were a few bright
spots in Saturday's grid opener.
Quarterbacks Gary Kerkorian and
Dick Horn came through with nearly
perfect passing and had excellent
protection. And Stanford's Bill Mc- !
Coll turned in an outstanding game
at the end, catching eight passes for j
154 yards.
Kssegian Shows Drive
Newcomer fullback Chuck Esse- j
gian, a transfer from Menlo Jun
ior College, showed plenty of drive
in the second half from his full- i
back position, as did sophomore
Wes Laubscher.
An outstanding play of the game
was registered by halfback Bob
Bryan, who tackled ;i Spartan b;ick 1
