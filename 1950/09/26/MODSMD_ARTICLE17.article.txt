Led by halfback Ollie Matson, 195

H ill toppers rolled over a highly re
garded Tulsa eleven, 23 to 14, in
Kezar Sati'"' ninht.
The Dons have a versatile running
game this season, but even more im
portant, also have a top flight passing
attack. USFers Gene Sweeters and
and Ed Brown's pitching to Matson
may cause the Indians plenty of
headaches comc Saturday.
However, there were a few bright
spots in Saturday's grid opener.
Quarterbacks Gary Kerkorian and
Dick Horn came through with nearly
perfect passing and had excellent
protection. And Stanford's Bill Mc- !
Coll turned in an outstanding game
at the end, catching eight passes for j
154 yards.

Newcomer fullback Chuck Esse- j

in the second half from his full- i
back position, as did sophomore
Wes Laubscher.

two last-quarter touchdowns.
