# Registration Totals Hit 5952 on First Day
## High Enrollment Puzzles Officials 
### 
Unexpectedly high first-day
registration figures have left
University officials puzzled as to
what final total to expect.
Yesterday's registration closed
with 4,360 men and 1,592 women on
the books, a total of 5,952. This was
a surprising gain of 259 over last,
year's first-day total of 5,693, com
posed of 4,303 men and 1,390 women.
No Record Expected
The high initial enrollment, does
not, however, indicate a higher total
registration than expected. Other
colleges have had a drop in enroll
ment, and Stanford officials do not
expect to approach last year's total
of over 7,900.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of stu
dents, interprets the first-day in
crease as a greater number of stu
dents returning early rather than a
larger total. He explained that a
larger group of entering students and
more so-called old returning students
(those registered previously but not
spring or summer quarter) are re
sponsible for the high registration.
Fewer Draftees
Dean Winbigler went on to say
that an original estimate of 7,500 total
registration was made to account for
the men expected to . ailed into
active duty with the reserves or
drafted. When it was found that such
a large number would not be called
immediately, the estimate was re
vised to 7,700. In spite of present en
rollment figures, Dean Winbigler be
lieves the latter number will hold
true.
The first-day registration figures
also show a larger number of women.
Two hundred of the 259 increase
were women. Dean Winbigler said
that this merely indicates a greater
number of women registering the
first day. In spite of the freshman
ratio of 2.85 to 1, the Dean docs not
think the final ratio will differ more
than a point or two from the 3.2
ratio which has been a standard at.
the Farm for several years.
Registration will continue today
for those students who did not com
plete the process yesterday. Old re
turning students who have not, yet
received their registration books may
pick them up at the Registrar's In
formation Office, Temporary Build
ing A, room 60, from 8 a.m. to 12 noon

STUDENTS JAM the Pavilion as registration for fall quarter be
gins. A first-day enrollment of 259 more than last year indicates
thai everyone has been striving to be first in the scramble for
reg books, class lists, and writer's cramp. The expected total
registration of 7,700 has not been changed by yesterday's high
enrollment. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson
Unexpectedly high first-day
registration figures have left
University officials puzzled as to
what final total to expect.
Yesterday's registration closed
with 4,360 men and 1,592 women on
the books, a total of 5,952. This was
a surprising gain of 259 over last,
year's first-day total of 5,693, com
posed of 4,303 men and 1,390 women.
No Record Expected
The high initial enrollment, does
not, however, indicate a higher total
registration than expected. Other
colleges have had a drop in enroll
ment, and Stanford officials do not
expect to approach last year's total
of over 7,900.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of stu
dents, interprets the first-day in
crease as a greater number of stu
dents returning early rather than a
larger total. He explained that a
larger group of entering students and
more so-called old returning students
(those registered previously but not
spring or summer quarter) are re
sponsible for the high registration.
Fewer Draftees
Dean Winbigler went on to say
that an original estimate of 7,500 total
registration was made to account for
the men expected to . ailed into
active duty with the reserves or
drafted. When it was found that such
a large number would not be called
immediately, the estimate was re
vised to 7,700. In spite of present en
rollment figures, Dean Winbigler be
lieves the latter number will hold
true.
The first-day registration figures
also show a larger number of women.
Two hundred of the 259 increase
were women. Dean Winbigler said
that this merely indicates a greater
number of women registering the
first day. In spite of the freshman
ratio of 2.85 to 1, the Dean docs not
think the final ratio will differ more
than a point or two from the 3.2
ratio which has been a standard at.
the Farm for several years.
