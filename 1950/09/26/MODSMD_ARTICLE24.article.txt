# As We Stand
## 
### 
Years come and go. Students graduate and
carry the Stanford tradition into Ihe profes
sional world. With them go the ideals of life on
the Farm. Fitting into a small but important
niche in this life—we like to think—is the Stan
ford Daily.
Whether our sheet is known as the "Dippy,"
a source of classroom entertainment, or merely
a lining for those bureau drawers or garbage
cans, we still attempt to carry on through our
columns a record of the "goings-on" around the
campus.
The Daily is not just an activity. Nor is it one
of the many clubs that unfold or fold from
month to month.
Our functions are two —service to the student
body and the Stanford family and a laboratory
for ourselves.
We can explain all our actions by one of the
two purposes on which we operate.
Hence an editorial stand, either pro or con, is
directed toward the furthering of what we think
are Stanford's best interests. We present the
news according to the reader interest on cam
pus.
That is why you regularly see the activities
of Excom given more attention than the organ
izational meeting of the Roble Hot Jazz Society.
Some editorials will be critical of a group or
person's actions; others will be congratulatory
for a good job well done. Even more frequently

the Daily's editorials will be like a tossed salad.
We throw in the ingredients, and you mix it the
way you want to. It is not a campus newspa
per's job to tell everyone how to run his busi
ness—only to present the picture and let the
reader shade it black or white.
That is why we sometimes may not take a
definite side on a problem. We say "here it is;
now what do you have to say about it?" Your
answer often will come through our Campus
Opinion column. Letters to the editor are re
stricted to 150 words and must be signed unless
specially requested by phone or in person.
This policy is built on the theory that if we are
willing to take the stand on some question, so
should our readers in their column.
Extensive local news coverage aided by col
orful pictures is our ultimate goal. To this com
bination we want to offer you the top headlines
of worldwide news—which seem to have an
even more local impact as the dispatches from
Korea arrive each day.
Our comments on this news which is in
cluded in the Daily five days a week, represent
the research and opinions of the five members
of the Daily Editorial Board. All editorials are
by the editor unless they are initialed other
wise.
Through our most sincere efforts and the stu
dent body's cooperation we will try to give the
campus a paper on a par with everything else
that is Stanford.

wise.
Through our most sincere efforts and the stu
dent body's cooperation we will try to give the
campus a paper on a par with everything else
that is Stanford.
Years come and go. Students graduate and
carry the Stanford tradition into Ihe profes
sional world. With them go the ideals of life on
the Farm. Fitting into a small but important
niche in this life—we like to think—is the Stan
ford Daily.
Whether our sheet is known as the "Dippy,"
a source of classroom entertainment, or merely
a lining for those bureau drawers or garbage
cans, we still attempt to carry on through our
columns a record of the "goings-on" around the
campus.
The Daily is not just an activity. Nor is it one
of the many clubs that unfold or fold from
month to month.
Our functions are two —service to the student
body and the Stanford family and a laboratory
for ourselves.
We can explain all our actions by one of the
two purposes on which we operate.
Hence an editorial stand, either pro or con, is
directed toward the furthering of what we think
are Stanford's best interests. We present the
news according to the reader interest on cam
pus.
That is why you regularly see the activities
of Excom given more attention than the organ
izational meeting of the Roble Hot Jazz Society.
Some editorials will be critical of a group or
person's actions; others will be congratulatory
for a good job well done. Even more frequently

the Daily's editorials will be like a tossed salad.
We throw in the ingredients, and you mix it the
way you want to. It is not a campus newspa
per's job to tell everyone how to run his busi
ness—only to present the picture and let the
reader shade it black or white.
That is why we sometimes may not take a
definite side on a problem. We say "here it is;
now what do you have to say about it?" Your
answer often will come through our Campus
Opinion column. Letters to the editor are re
stricted to 150 words and must be signed unless
specially requested by phone or in person.
This policy is built on the theory that if we are
willing to take the stand on some question, so
should our readers in their column.
Extensive local news coverage aided by col
orful pictures is our ultimate goal. To this com
bination we want to offer you the top headlines
of worldwide news—which seem to have an
even more local impact as the dispatches from
Korea arrive each day.
Our comments on this news which is in
cluded in the Daily five days a week, represent
the research and opinions of the five members
of the Daily Editorial Board. All editorials are
by the editor unless they are initialed other
