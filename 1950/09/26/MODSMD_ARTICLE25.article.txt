# They Ushered Them In
## 
### 
Stanford's largest freshman class plus a few
hundred new transfer students are now mem
bers of the Stanford Family. Thanks to a hard
working Pre-Reg Committee, the tie that binds
should prove to be very strong.
More than a thousand new students faced
college for the first time last week with mixed
feelings of bigness and smallness—bigness be
cause they were finally in college, and small
ness because they were entering a large, new
place.
Much of their anxiety was quickly dispelled
as Pre-Reg committee began to indoctrinate the
new students into Stanford life.
This "processing" has become one of Stan
ford's finest traditions. In the first place, the
newcomers are met with a ready hand and
warm smile. Those students coming long dis
tances by train were given transportation to
their dorms. A full four days of exchanges,
barbecue, dance, entertainment, tours, and con

ferences was planned by the Pre-Reg commit
tee to make the students feel at home.
Above all, there was no hazing. The fresh
man found himself a member of the Stanford
Family on an equal footing with the upper
classmen. Class spirit will come soon enough,
but this first step is an important factor in the
development of Stanford spirit, which is greater
than class spirit.
New students v/ill find many a ready hand
waiting to help them as they start their studies.
Resident directors, sponsors, faculty advisors,
and administration officers are eager to help
eliminate the confusion which is unavoidable
in the new campus life. The new student helps
himself by taking advantage of this outside
help.
The work of the Pre Reg committee is almost
finished. They may retire with the knowledge
that they have performed a job well done.
