### VIC PALMIERI 
What's the matter, freshmen? Having trouble with
Reg Day? You say you're tired of standing in line?
Your adviser has got you all fouled up? Well, give
that little girl back the fountain pen you borrowed two
hours ago and come listen while Uncle Remus tells
you the tale of the greatest orgy in Stanford history
— Reg Day, 1946.
Maybe 1946 seems like a long time ago to you. Well,
it was way back when girls wore skirts instead of
tents. And when you could take a coed out for a brew
and not have her wind up ordering a champagne cock
tail. And when the girls at Storey House still answered
the phone, "DG House" . . . Lemme see, I know
there were boys around too. Oh yeah, a fullback
named Lloyd Merriman was such a ball of fire that
Marchie was threatening the LA alumni.
But just ask anyone who was here then (there's
only two of us still around . . . the other guy's study
ing for his Ph.D. and I'll finish my lower division re
quirements next quarter) what he remembers best
about that year and he'll shudder and say, "reg day."
(II he says "registration day" -write him off as long
winded.)
They tell me they started lining up in front of the
old administration building about two o'clock that cold
September morning. All I know is by the time I got
out of bed, brushed my tooth, and got over there it
cost me 40 cents to take a bus to the end of the line.
I might have slipped in but they started hollering
when they saw me so I had to go back and put some
clothes on. By noon the situation was so bad you had
to have a seat card to get into the restroom ... I

didn't mirid that so much, but you had to have three
prerequisites to get out.
I hung around the ad building stabbing reg dance
ticket salesmen and trying to figure out some way to
get in. Then I noticed some of the football players
walking casually in past a cop at a side door. Quickly
I rolled up my shirt sleeves under my sweater, creat
ing a nice musculai bulge on each arm, stuck a band
aid across the bridge of my nose, and ran three quick
laps around Quad for atmosphere.
Then moving with the lithe grace of a born athlete,
I approached the cop at the door. "Sorry, son," he
said "spastic cases register tomorrow when the crowd
ain't so thick." Laughing at his little joke, I kneed
him and walked.
Inside it was so crowded half the girls got pinned
and a dozen got married before the week was out. I
might have gotten pinned myself but my shoulders are
to round he couldn't keep them down the full three
seconds. I know of several people who bent over to
pick up a pencil and were never heard of again.
I never would have made my way through the
crowd if I hadn't just come from a quick lunch at
Carlun's, but as it was, I just breezed through . . .
get it? (You see, the first words I heard iny mother
say when they handed me to her in the maternity
ward were, "ugly children are usually clever, aren't
they?")
Anyway, frosh, now you know how good you've
got it . . . 'eept for one thing. Know what it cost to
streamline Reg Day? Well, way back in 1946 the clip
labeled tuition was $106.65 . . . me, I liked it the old
way.

named Lloyd Merriman was such a ball of fire that
Marchie was threatening the LA alumni.
But just ask anyone who was here then (there's
only two of us still around . . . the other guy's study
ing for his Ph.D. and I'll finish my lower division re
quirements next quarter) what he remembers best
about that year and he'll shudder and say, "reg day."
(II he says "registration day" -write him off as long
winded.)
They tell me they started lining up in front of the
old administration building about two o'clock that cold
September morning. All I know is by the time I got
out of bed, brushed my tooth, and got over there it
cost me 40 cents to take a bus to the end of the line.
I might have slipped in but they started hollering
when they saw me so I had to go back and put some
clothes on. By noon the situation was so bad you had
to have a seat card to get into the restroom ... I

didn't mirid that so much, but you had to have three
prerequisites to get out.
I hung around the ad building stabbing reg dance
ticket salesmen and trying to figure out some way to
get in. Then I noticed some of the football players
walking casually in past a cop at a side door. Quickly
I rolled up my shirt sleeves under my sweater, creat
ing a nice musculai bulge on each arm, stuck a band
aid across the bridge of my nose, and ran three quick
laps around Quad for atmosphere.
Then moving with the lithe grace of a born athlete,
I approached the cop at the door. "Sorry, son," he
said "spastic cases register tomorrow when the crowd
ain't so thick." Laughing at his little joke, I kneed
him and walked.
Inside it was so crowded half the girls got pinned
and a dozen got married before the week was out. I
might have gotten pinned myself but my shoulders are
to round he couldn't keep them down the full three
seconds. I know of several people who bent over to
pick up a pencil and were never heard of again.
I never would have made my way through the
crowd if I hadn't just come from a quick lunch at
Carlun's, but as it was, I just breezed through . . .
get it? (You see, the first words I heard iny mother
say when they handed me to her in the maternity
ward were, "ugly children are usually clever, aren't
they?")
Anyway, frosh, now you know how good you've
got it . . . 'eept for one thing. Know what it cost to
streamline Reg Day? Well, way back in 1946 the clip
labeled tuition was $106.65 . . . me, I liked it the old
way.
What's the matter, freshmen? Having trouble with
Reg Day? You say you're tired of standing in line?
Your adviser has got you all fouled up? Well, give
that little girl back the fountain pen you borrowed two
hours ago and come listen while Uncle Remus tells
you the tale of the greatest orgy in Stanford history
— Reg Day, 1946.
Maybe 1946 seems like a long time ago to you. Well,
it was way back when girls wore skirts instead of
tents. And when you could take a coed out for a brew
and not have her wind up ordering a champagne cock
tail. And when the girls at Storey House still answered
the phone, "DG House" . . . Lemme see, I know
there were boys around too. Oh yeah, a fullback
named Lloyd Merriman was such a ball of fire that
Marchie was threatening the LA alumni.
