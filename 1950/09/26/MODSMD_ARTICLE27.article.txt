# ON OTHER CAMPUSES

### CORNELIA LITTLE 
As it must to all dogs, death came last June to
George Tirebiter, age and lineage unknown, nation
ally-famed mascot of the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
The airedale-type mutt who had been chasing Troy's
convertibles since 1941 was so much the subject of
legend and controversy that SC's I>aily Trojan couldn't
get two obituary writers to agree on all the details of
his checkered career. But this much is sure: that
George earned his name and fame as "Goodyear gour
met" and "Fisk-fancier" on University Avenue; that
his numerous dognappings, disappearances, and other
escapades held the attention of the whole campus; and
that he once bit Cal's Oski on the nose.
The Southland school's answer to the Army mule
and the Navy goat was eulogized by LA newspapers
and University leaders. Perhaps the finest tribute
came from USC President Fagg, who said, "No one
could rival him in energy, friendly spirit, or loyalty to
the cardinal and gold ... I never knew him to criti
cize a faculty member, to say an unkind word about a

sludent, 01 to chide the administration for the paucity
of its parking facilities. In every way, he was a gentle
man."
"George went out as he loved to come in—sur
rounded by convertibles and pretty coeds," reported
the Trojan. The roadster procession that marked his
funeral ended wilh the laying of a wreath over the
section of University Avenue pavement in which Tire
biter's footprints are embedded, next to the cleat
marks of Troy's football greats.

At the University of California, bitterness over the
loyalty oath has spread up to that chameleonic Big C
on the Berkeley hillside, reports the Daily Cal. Early
in the summer the Young Republicans, "in a burst of
patriotism after the outbreak of the Korean conflict,"
painted it red, white, and blue. "It remained so for
about two weeks until, on a foggy morning after the
July meeting of the Regents, the emblem of univer
sity spirit appeared above the campus in grim, sombre
black In mourning for academic freedom.
