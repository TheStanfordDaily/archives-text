FLUSHING, N.Y, Sept. 25—Brit
ain today refused to give complete
approval to the United States' rev- j
olutinnary plan for veto-free Unit
ed Nations machinery to handle fu- |
turc aggression.
British Foreign Secretary Ernest
Bevin, while expressing "full agree
ment with its objectives," told the
General Assembly he was sure the
U.S. would "welcome constructive
criticism" on details.
A British spokesman said this
could be taken as an indication
♦ hat Britain favors earmarking na
tional military units for UN use,
but is leery of the plan to put them
at the service of the veto-free Gen
eral Assembly if a veto bars Secu
rity Council action.
Bevin urged the UN to find means
for following up a military victory
in Korea with restoration of that
battered country's unity. But/ he
ducked the question of whether the
fast - advancing UN forces should
'toss the 38th parallel to achieve
this.
