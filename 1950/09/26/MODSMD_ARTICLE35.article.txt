# Choir, Chorus Tryouts Open
## 
### 
Stanford choral organizations em
bark on their year of choral music
with tryouts today and tomorrow
from 2 to 5 p.m. in the choir room
beneath Memorial Church. New
freshmen as well as all other stu
dents are encouraged to audition
for the University Chorus or Choir.
The University Chorus, a group
of approximately 160 singers, will
present several programs of music
throughout the school year, high
lighted by an appearance with the
San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra. The group will take part in
performances of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony and Mahler's Second
Symphony.
The Choir will present its annual
Christmas carol program in addi
tion to singing in the Sunday
services. Later in the year a choral
festival in honor of Dr. A. T. David
son, choral director at Harvard
University, will be participated in
by both Choir and Chorus.
The University Madrigal Sing
ers, a small group under the direc
tion of Herbert B. Nanney, will
perform early madrigal and choral
music written expressly for smaller
choruses.
Both the Choir and Chorus are
under the direction of Harold C.
Schmidt.
