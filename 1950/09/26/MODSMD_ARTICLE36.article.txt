# Indian Summer Brings Busy Daze to Farm
## 
### AL BERRY Acting Editor, Summer Daily 
Summer at Stanford: Sunny days, j
balmy nights, a quiet campus, and a
handful of very pretty but fairly j
stupid girls. Two-point-three-eight- ;
six students, a 3 to 1 ratio, new ad- I
ministrative appointments, and a j
near panic among the younger men
over the war, the draft, and the girls
again.
The top early summer story for the j
Summer Daily was the announce
ment that Dr. H. Donald Winbigler
was named the new Dean of Stu
dents, replacing the beloved Dean
Lawrence Kimpton, who was "bur
gbed" from the Farm by the Univer- i
sity of Chicago. Winbigler, after
live torrid years as the Stanford reg
istrar, took over, his new duties on
July 1.
Another new appointment rocked
the first edition of Editor Jim
Thurber's Slimmer Daily: the ap
pointment of Robert Mac Fee Minto
as the new University Chaplain, j
Minto replaced Chaplain Fan I C. 1
Johnston, who did not leave Stan- 1

ford on a rail, but did depart with
a nice blast in a public Falo Alto
address, on how he had been mis
treated during his tenure on Sena
tor Stanford's Farm. He collected
six months additional pay before
he left.
Guiding the ASSU destinies during
the summer quarter were high
hurdler and old L'Ommiesman
Downing McKee and pretty, blonde
Veep Nan Cornell. What Excom liked
to call its social calendar, was opened
with a co-recreational swimming
party in the delicious pool of the
women's gym. Co-recreational, this
summer, meant that three boys got
the privilege of jumping into the
j water with one girl.
The next great social extravaganza
was an open house, on June 30, at
Lagunita, where all of the campus'
female residents were housed. The
J affair was tabbed a roaring success,
. in spite of the fact that very few
people attended. Other zipping social
j events included an all-campus beach
I party, a hum-dinger "social" at the
1 Nitery, a faculty-student shindig,

and an informal informal at the sum
mer men's residence, tottering old
Encina.
One of the highlights of the Stan
ford summer season occurred on
July 25, when (and we quote from
the Daily's story) "The women of
Lagunita Court will be hostesses
for an afternoon lemonade party."
It was, reports claimed, a dashing
event. Not content with the splen
did success of the lemonade party,
Excom followed up the partyline
with an ASSU picnic the follow
ing Friday. It was hfdd. with a
finesse, peculiar only to the Farm,
on the women's athletic field.
Party-time reached its ultimate on
the Farm on August 4, when Union
Court became the scene of a real
honest - to - goodness watermelon
party. The Daily story said, "Stu
dents are asked, however, to help the
committee by using the GI disposal
cans for the rinds and seeds." The
400 students who attended were very
cooperative, with the rinds, and it
was the last social event of the jam
packed season.
Ah, but it was not all picnics, par
ties, and balls on the Farm this sum
mer. Disaster also played its part.
On June 22, the Sequoia Theater,
home of B pictures and long pic
torial advertisements, finally gave up
the ghost. As Gunfighter Gregory
Peck blasted away at some unfor
tunate extra, the roof of the Sequoia
quietly collapsed, sending 27 paying
flick-viewers to the hospital. The
next day a PTA conference opened
at Stanford.
On June 26 the Armies of the
People's Republic of North Korea
crossed the 38th parallel. It was
good timing for the Summer Stan
fordites, for the next day Carlos
P. Romulo, at that time President
of the United Nations General As
sembly, was scheduled to speak to
the campus in the Memorial Ilall.
And that night Benjamin Cohen,
assistant secretary general of the
UN, spoke at the Tuesday Evening
Scries. While both men, Romulo
and Cohen, were unprepared to
commit themselves fully at that
early date on the Korean situation,
their addresses, to capacity audi
ences, did provide the Farm with
two of the most timely speeches of

Stanford's 59-year-old history.
Stanford in the summer is gener
ally the scene of many national con
ferences and meetings. Thus, as
j school opened, newsmen from all
, over the nation met here in the
Twellth Annual Editor's Conference.
This was followed by a convention of
the PTA, and later by the National
Federation of Business and Profes
; sional Women's Clubs.
The Daily started its next "Confab"
story with "Pacific Coa.st business
j and industrial leaders will look ahead
to the second half of the century at
the Ninth Annual Stanford Business
j Conference July 24-28 in the Uni
versity campus."
The Biz Confab was followed up
with a California High School English
Teachers' meeting, and 10-o'clock-
Cellar-coffee-time began to look like
a co-recreational meeting of the Su
preme Court. Likewise on the Con
ference front were scores of meet-
I ings within and about the Eduea
t tional Department.
The biggest running local story
of the Summer Daily was probably
I the dedication of the new Law
; School building. Formal dedication
of the new building, from the shell
i of the former Administration
i Building, caused several hundred
j Law School grads to return to their
alma mater to hear Supreme Court
Justice Robert 11. Jackson deliver
the dedication address.
The Stanford Players continued
during the summer in their untiring
efforts to bring the theater to the
Cardinal campus. Their first pro
duction was "Accent on Youth," and
their second was "A Storm, A Tiger,"
I both of which were hailed as unbe
i lievably bad. The other two plays,
"The Hasty Heart" and "Rain," were
overwhelming successes (smash, as
they say in the big city).
Amidst the din of hammers on the
inner Quad rebuilding job, the rattle
of flivvers trying to find the campus
roads, the crash of folk-dancing feet,
and the muscular panting of Sierra
Club members, a new noise crashed
through Stanford's quiet atmosphere
j this summer. It was the shriek of the
j 22-year-old about to be drafted.
Typical of those who were about
; to fix bayonets was Daily Editor
James P. Thurber. Thurher had
j been planning on marrying Stan
fordite Emily Forrest on or about
the 2:ird of September. His draft
board told him he would be in camp
I by the 23rd. On the sth of August,

Editor Thurher dumped the Stan
ford Daily into the lap of his Man
aging Editor and took cfY for Chi
cago where he and Emily were
married on August 9. Thus, for the
lirst time in Daily history an Acting
Editor took over. Oddly enough,
the paper continued to come out.
Names in the Summer News: Dick
Andrews was elected Encina presi
dent. John Jennings shone in "Ac
cent on Youth." Boh Mathias set a
new world's decathlon record in Tu
lare. Backfield coach Kay Ilammett
left the Stanford grid game and was
replaced by Rose Bowler Pete Kmet
ovic. Stravinsky flopped in Mem.
Aud. recital. Herbert Hoover only
made the Daily's front page three
times in the 10-week session.
Forrest Barr and Dave Leavitt won
a debate with USC. Cardswimmer
Ralph Sala was named on the all-
America tank team. Bobby Rosberg
won the 12th Stanford Invitational
Golf Tournament.
Harvey Hall was appointed regis
trar to replace Dean of Students
Winbigler. Professor Margery Bailey
played the lead in the Hillbarn's
summer stock production of "Trojan
Women." Cornelia Little became the
Stanford Daily's first Washington
Correspondent, dashing off columns
of capital capers. Alf Brandin told
students that they must not hunt
deer on campus.
Ex-Excomer Murk Hatfield was
named Dean of Students at Wil
lamette University, one year out of
Stanford. Arthur Fiedler led the
Boston Pops Orchestra as the
Standard Hour was sadly pre
sented in the Mem. Aud. Tita
Cooley ran Lagunita's "Mid
summer Night's Dream" Formal.
Alpiner Dave Ilarrah, the first to
climb a mountain in the Andes, lost
several frost-bitten toes.
Death came to Professor Emeritus
of Zoology George Price.
Herbert Hoover, absent from the
Farm, hit Communism on his 76th
birthday. Hagopian, Vardae, and
Forsman combined to make "Rain"
a smash. Janet Blair was great in
"South Terrific" in the City. Emery
Mitchell, ex-Card fullback, now
Card coach, played in the Chicago
all-star game. Harold C. Schmidt led
the choir in a new Randall Thompson
composition in the Mem. Aud.
Deke Edward Wilson gave Esquire
readers the "inside on fraternity ini
tiations."
And a good time was had by all.
