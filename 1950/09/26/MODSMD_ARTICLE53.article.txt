# Farm Research Institute Battles Southland Smog

### 
Stanford Research Institute chem
; ists in Los Angeles are trying to
make their eyes smart with semi
microscopic smog particles, but so
far they have had no luck in dis
covering what causes eye irritation
among the residents of the south
land during smogtime.
Paul L. Magill, supervisor of the
j Institute's air and water pollution
I research program, said yesterday,
j "It is fairly certain that the very
I fine particles typical of Los An
geles smog do not by themselves
cause eye smarting by any chemi
cal or mechanical action against the
eyeball."
Using face masks, test observers
have exposed their eyes to many
types of fine particles collected in
Los Angeles during smoggy days.
Also tried have been various
forms of carbon that might be pro
duced by burning oil and rubbish.
Fine crystals of sodium chloride
that might be carried inland from
I the ocean, and even droplets of
| used crankcase oil, have been
tested.
The quantities used in the test
atmosphere were over a thousand
times the concentrations found on

a smoggy day in Los Angeles. No
eye irritation resulted.
In a series of laboratory investi
gations, particles of numerous sus
pect materials were suspended in
the atmosphere and blown through
a series of cyclone towers designed
to separate the particles into sizes
ranging from 2 to 20 microns (a
micron is 1/25,000 th of an inch) and
then into a face mask worn by an
observer.
The fact that there was no irri
tation indicates that minute motes
of the size tV.at exist in Los An
geles air are too small to produce
the effect of a free-flying cinder or
dust particle caught in the eye.
Mr. Magill emphasized that the
Institute is following a systematic
program of testing all the impuri
ties known to exist in the atmos
phere, eliminating as many suspects
as possible and examining the ef
fects of various combinations of
impurities.
The recent construction of several
new pieces of testing equipment
and new information on the analy
sis of the atmosphere are expected
to shed additional light on what
causes eye irritation, and why.
