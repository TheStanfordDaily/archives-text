## The 						Sporting Line 
### 
The weekend's game results clouded the grid picture a little, but a now
familiar saying about those crosstown rivals—Southern Cal and UCLA—
still holds true. If Red Sanders were headman at Troy, the Trojans would
be national champs or near it; and if Jeff Cravath switched over to West
wood, well, the Bruins would be in even worse shape.
Before coming back to the Farm, I witnessed a couple of down south
scrimmages. First of all, don't be fooled by what UCLA did to Oregon (an
easy 28 to 0 win). Either the Westwooders improved a heck of a lot in a
few days, or else the Oregonmen have slipped way down from their co-Con
ference championship days. The latter not only seems the most logical, but
practically the only answer.
Southern Cal Loaded
As for the Downtowners, they're loaded and packed something like an
atomic bomb. If someone got a hold of them and could control the Thun
dering Herd, they'd be mighty dangerous. With so much beef and talent in
the forward wall and with Jaycee transfers adding a great halfback (A 1
Carmichael) and extra strength at quarter (Ed Demirjian), the Trojans
could be rugged on any given afternoon.
Now, hack to the Westwood campus. Most of the Bruin practices j*re wit
nessed by numbers of red-hot alums, family and friends of the team, and
University faculty members. One day the PCC refs turned out for a little
classroom work and exercise. It was amusing to see about 30 officials
switching jobs every few minutes, and then later go through wind sprints
to get in shape. Morley Drury, former SC great, had the toughest time
puffing his way through the workout.
Another interesting thing is the Southern accents that go along with each
command of the coaching staff. Seems Coach Sanders imported his whole
staff from Vanderbilt.
The one full-dress scrimmage of game length that I had the fortune to
witness was a sorrowful mess. Over 12 fumbles highlighted the practice to
the horror of Mr. Sanders. Ail-American end candidate Bob Wilkinson
had trouble learning his new safety position, miscalculating kick after kick.
With only Johnny Florence and Ted Narleski showing fair form as passers
from the tailback post, most of the Bruin attack will have to rest in the
power running of Fullback Dave Williams, backed up by Luther Keyes.
Williams is a powerfully built man, with a knees-high action that is hard
to halt.
Besides the lack of deception, the scrub line kept on outcharging the
temporary first-stringers, it was conceivably a bad day, but from the
frowns of the coaching staff, Bruin trouble appeared more permanent.
There's plenty ol spirit and men out, and improvement is bound to come.
Bruins" Wilkinson Tough to Stop
Saturday's Coliseum opener was nothing more than some hapless Ducks
butchered before a huppy Los Angeles clambake. UCLA passers had a
field day when Oregon couldn't cope with Wilkinson and then later doubled
up on him only to leave Bob Hansen open on numerous plays.
The inaccuracy of the Northern passers made for five big interceptions
and set-up the Bruins several times. Mr. Williams' timely smashes ripped
the Duck line adequately. Only statistic that the Oregons had the Bruins
topped in was punting average. It was -»0.2 to 40.0.
Let's switch back to Southern Cal. According to preseason dope, only
serious weakness that faced old Jeff was at tackle. But the rapid improve
ment of sophs Bobby Van Doren and shotputter Elmer Wilhoite along with
the new fire of two-year letterman Volney Peters makes the tackle position
one of the strongest.
Two pairs of two-year vets with other lettermen for relief manage to make
the guards and tackles pretty solid. Such stalwarts as Hal Hatfield, Dan
Zimmerman, Bill Jessup, A 1 Baldock, Jess Swope, Paul McMurtry, and Bob
Downs are around again for another Rose Bowl try.
To make up lor the slight lack of material in the backfield, El Troje
imported enough transfers to provide a strong attack. There's nothing
wrong with a starting foursome of either Demerjian or Wilbur Robertson at
quarter, Carmichael and Bill Bowers at halves and the former Portland
prep flash, Pat Duff, at fullback.
The big question is how the Thundering Herd will go under fire. It
might take a little while for them to start stampeding, but watch out for
them late in the season.

Bruins" Wilkinson Tough to Stop
Saturday's Coliseum opener was nothing more than some hapless Ducks
butchered before a huppy Los Angeles clambake. UCLA passers had a
field day when Oregon couldn't cope with Wilkinson and then later doubled
up on him only to leave Bob Hansen open on numerous plays.
The inaccuracy of the Northern passers made for five big interceptions
and set-up the Bruins several times. Mr. Williams' timely smashes ripped
the Duck line adequately. Only statistic that the Oregons had the Bruins
topped in was punting average. It was -»0.2 to 40.0.
Let's switch back to Southern Cal. According to preseason dope, only
serious weakness that faced old Jeff was at tackle. But the rapid improve
ment of sophs Bobby Van Doren and shotputter Elmer Wilhoite along with
the new fire of two-year letterman Volney Peters makes the tackle position
one of the strongest.
Two pairs of two-year vets with other lettermen for relief manage to make
the guards and tackles pretty solid. Such stalwarts as Hal Hatfield, Dan
Zimmerman, Bill Jessup, A 1 Baldock, Jess Swope, Paul McMurtry, and Bob
Downs are around again for another Rose Bowl try.
To make up lor the slight lack of material in the backfield, El Troje
imported enough transfers to provide a strong attack. There's nothing
wrong with a starting foursome of either Demerjian or Wilbur Robertson at
quarter, Carmichael and Bill Bowers at halves and the former Portland
prep flash, Pat Duff, at fullback.
The big question is how the Thundering Herd will go under fire. It
might take a little while for them to start stampeding, but watch out for
them late in the season.
The weekend's game results clouded the grid picture a little, but a now
familiar saying about those crosstown rivals—Southern Cal and UCLA—
still holds true. If Red Sanders were headman at Troy, the Trojans would
be national champs or near it; and if Jeff Cravath switched over to West
wood, well, the Bruins would be in even worse shape.
Before coming back to the Farm, I witnessed a couple of down south
scrimmages. First of all, don't be fooled by what UCLA did to Oregon (an
easy 28 to 0 win). Either the Westwooders improved a heck of a lot in a
few days, or else the Oregonmen have slipped way down from their co-Con
ference championship days. The latter not only seems the most logical, but
practically the only answer.
Southern Cal Loaded
As for the Downtowners, they're loaded and packed something like an
atomic bomb. If someone got a hold of them and could control the Thun
dering Herd, they'd be mighty dangerous. With so much beef and talent in
the forward wall and with Jaycee transfers adding a great halfback (A 1
Carmichael) and extra strength at quarter (Ed Demirjian), the Trojans
could be rugged on any given afternoon.
Now, hack to the Westwood campus. Most of the Bruin practices j*re wit
nessed by numbers of red-hot alums, family and friends of the team, and
University faculty members. One day the PCC refs turned out for a little
classroom work and exercise. It was amusing to see about 30 officials
switching jobs every few minutes, and then later go through wind sprints
to get in shape. Morley Drury, former SC great, had the toughest time
puffing his way through the workout.
Another interesting thing is the Southern accents that go along with each
command of the coaching staff. Seems Coach Sanders imported his whole
staff from Vanderbilt.
The one full-dress scrimmage of game length that I had the fortune to
witness was a sorrowful mess. Over 12 fumbles highlighted the practice to
the horror of Mr. Sanders. Ail-American end candidate Bob Wilkinson
had trouble learning his new safety position, miscalculating kick after kick.
With only Johnny Florence and Ted Narleski showing fair form as passers
from the tailback post, most of the Bruin attack will have to rest in the
power running of Fullback Dave Williams, backed up by Luther Keyes.
Williams is a powerfully built man, with a knees-high action that is hard
to halt.
Besides the lack of deception, the scrub line kept on outcharging the
temporary first-stringers, it was conceivably a bad day, but from the
frowns of the coaching staff, Bruin trouble appeared more permanent.
There's plenty ol spirit and men out, and improvement is bound to come.
