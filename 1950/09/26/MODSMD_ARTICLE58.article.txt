## Cardbabes Show Polished Defense 
### 
With one week gone and three yet
; to I=o before their first game, the j
Stanford frosh gridders have thus far 1
shown that their offense has yet to i
measure up to their defense.
Last Saturday's scrimmage showed :
signs of defensive know-how, but a !
lack of offensive blocking.
Coach Bob Ghilotti was pleased j
with the work of Marshall Howe and
Ed Tanner as linebackers and Sam
Morely in the pass-catching depart
ment. Highly-touted Bob Garrett and
J Doug Collins, both quarterbacks,
| threaded the needle in their passing,
i Others who were impressed were
I Don Day and Pete Larmer, fullâ€”
I backs; Frank Tenerello, halfback;
' and Don Harcourt, tackle.
