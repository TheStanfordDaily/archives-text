# Indian Crew Now Ranks With Best College Eights
## 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's orphan crew showed
everyone they weren't children any
more when they placed fourth in
the Marietta boat race at the be
ginning of the summer.
Yes, fourth—not 'third as was the
original decision. Three weeks af
ter the race, as a result of watch
ing movies of the race (who said
movies were a wonderful inven
tion?), Wisconsin was placed ahead
of the Cards behind Washington
and California.
Potential Power
But the point is that Stanford
made a showing, and a good one at
that. From here on, the shellmen
"down on the Farm" will be rec
ognized as a potential power on the
West Coast.
Proof of this is the fact that ne
gotiations are now under way to
add Washington to the Cards' crew
calendar this spring on the Huskies'
stomping grounds.
If the Husky encounter can be
arranged, it will pit the Reds again' ~
the two top crews in the country
this year. Obviously, Washington
and California don't consider them
orphan children.
Speaking of orphans, a letter has
recently been submitted to the
Stanford Athletic Board by the
crew, asking partial financial sup
port for a three-year trial program
with reconsideration to be made at
the end of that time.
Response Good
Although response thus far has
been favorable, no action will be
taken before Christmas. Under the
program the Athletic Board would
put up part of the $8,000 a year
budget (California has a $45,000 a
year crew budget), various alumni
would put up part, and the crew
would raise the remainder.
During the summer Coach Jim
Beggs and members of the crew
worked on their equipment in
preparation for the first fall prac

tice in the history of the Stanford
crtw. All regular members of the
crew. All regular members of the
ago to finish all work and to start
practice.
A new shell, purchased with
money presented by last year's
senior class, will soon be delivered
Practices to Begin
Regular afternoon practices be
gin this week and will continue un
til Thanksgiving. Later, morning
practices will begin.
The Cards lost three "'Marietta
men" from the first boat through
graduation — Ray Atkinson, Dick
Oakley, and Jay Niblo — but re
placements will soon be found. The
remaining members of last year's
varsity are Captain Jim Fiftr, Bill
Meyer, Don Craven, Dick Porter,
Arend Horstmeyer, and coxswain
Dave Herdman.
The Class of '54 may offer the
greatest batch of crewmen Stan
ford has yet seen, and since there
are so many skyscrapers in the
class, it promises to be a very val
uable addition to the Card crew.

Practices to Begin
Regular afternoon practices be
gin this week and will continue un
til Thanksgiving. Later, morning
practices will begin.
The Cards lost three "'Marietta
men" from the first boat through
graduation — Ray Atkinson, Dick
Oakley, and Jay Niblo — but re
placements will soon be found. The
remaining members of last year's
varsity are Captain Jim Fiftr, Bill
Meyer, Don Craven, Dick Porter,
Arend Horstmeyer, and coxswain
Dave Herdman.
The Class of '54 may offer the
greatest batch of crewmen Stan
ford has yet seen, and since there
are so many skyscrapers in the
class, it promises to be a very val
uable addition to the Card crew.
Stanford's orphan crew showed
everyone they weren't children any
more when they placed fourth in
the Marietta boat race at the be
ginning of the summer.
Yes, fourth—not 'third as was the
original decision. Three weeks af
ter the race, as a result of watch
ing movies of the race (who said
movies were a wonderful inven
tion?), Wisconsin was placed ahead
of the Cards behind Washington
and California.
Potential Power
But the point is that Stanford
made a showing, and a good one at
that. From here on, the shellmen
"down on the Farm" will be rec
ognized as a potential power on the
West Coast.
Proof of this is the fact that ne
gotiations are now under way to
add Washington to the Cards' crew
calendar this spring on the Huskies'
stomping grounds.
If the Husky encounter can be
arranged, it will pit the Reds again' ~
the two top crews in the country
this year. Obviously, Washington
and California don't consider them
orphan children.
Speaking of orphans, a letter has
recently been submitted to the
Stanford Athletic Board by the
crew, asking partial financial sup
port for a three-year trial program
with reconsideration to be made at
the end of that time.
Response Good
Although response thus far has
been favorable, no action will be
taken before Christmas. Under the
program the Athletic Board would
put up part of the $8,000 a year
budget (California has a $45,000 a
year crew budget), various alumni
would put up part, and the crew
would raise the remainder.
During the summer Coach Jim
Beggs and members of the crew
worked on their equipment in
preparation for the first fall prac

tice in the history of the Stanford
crtw. All regular members of the
crew. All regular members of the
ago to finish all work and to start
practice.
A new shell, purchased with
money presented by last year's
senior class, will soon be delivered
