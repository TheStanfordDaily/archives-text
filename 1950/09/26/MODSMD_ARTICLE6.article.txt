# Farm Students Left Homeless As Salvatierra House Burns
## 
### 
The second and third floors of
"Alpha Salvatierra," rooming
house at Salvatierra and Ar
guello, were gutted with 10-foot
high flames Saturday afternoon,
damaging clothes and personal
property belonging to 14 Stan
ford students.
Damage to the 50-year-old house
was believed to be approximately
3)10,000. All residents of the burned
out wooden structure were left
homeless, and several had no clothes
except those they were wearing when
j they went to the football game Sat
urday.
The building was empty when
smoke was seen pouring from the
roof about 4:15 p.m. by Earl Laduc,
a Corporation Yard truck driver,
| who was near Stern Hall. He hur
ried up to the corner of Salvatierra
and Arguello streets, and turned
in the alarm from the box at that
corner.
The house is located across the
street north of the Chi Psi House and
is just west of the Women's Rest
Home.
Three Stanford fire engines, in
cluding one called from the Stadium,
rushed to the rooming house, which
was burning dangerously by the
j time they arrived.
Firemen forced way to the

second floor and battled the inferno
which seemed to center in a narrow
winding staircase leading to the third
floor attic apartment.
By the time the flames had sub
sided, there were four firemen, in
cluding three part-time student
firemen, on the injured list.
James Kerr has cuts on his head
received when he was hit by an axe.
Myron Pellsinger was severely
gashed on the arm, and Darrhl Den
toni got a nail in his foot.
Capt. Frank Jurian, a full-time
fireman, injui'ed his knee when he
fell through a section of the floor. All
were treated at the hospital and re
leased.
The Fire Department sent about 15
men to fight the fire, and the trucks
stayed near the charred house until
nearly midnight. Firemen patrolled
the fire until early Sunday morning.
The house was a shambles even
after the gallons of water which had
been poured on the blaze had been
cleared away. Shingles, which fell
from the black skeleton-like roof,
were strewn about the lawn along
with blackened heaps of clothing and
furniture completely ruined by the
water, smoke, and flames.
The closets, stairway, and ceilings
caused a draft which fanned the
flames as they razed the upper
stories.
Mr. and Mrs. Robert McGinnis,
managers of the house, yesterday

I tried to salvage furniture and clothes
I which the firemen had covered with
tarpaulins when they shot streams of
water at the blistered walls.
"The firemen were very consid
erate in covering the furniture
i when they came in, and (hey
cleaned up the mess very well,"
McGinnis, who is a graduate stu
dent in sociology, said.
His wife, who helps him manage
the rooming house for 12 other stu
dents, said all 14 of them would be
homeless, and was hopeful that some
one would help them find a room.
They said the house, which is
owned by Mrs. Helen SutlifTe, for
merly a librarian at Stanford, is not
heavily insured.
They feared most of the loss of per
sonal property would have to be
shouldered by the individual room
ers, all upper division and graduate
students. They added that the unre
pairable damage to the house means
the loss of the elderly owner's only
source of income.
The house was moved to its present
i location at 565 Salvatierra in 1903
from a lot just south of where Stern
Hall now stands.
\
Firemen said the blaze was the
most serious fire on campus since the
third floor of the Deke house was
razed several years ago.
The cause of the fire was unknown,
although the residents mentioned
the possibility of faulty electric
lines.

The second and third floors of
"Alpha Salvatierra," rooming
house at Salvatierra and Ar
guello, were gutted with 10-foot
high flames Saturday afternoon,
damaging clothes and personal
property belonging to 14 Stan
ford students.
Damage to the 50-year-old house
was believed to be approximately
3)10,000. All residents of the burned
out wooden structure were left
homeless, and several had no clothes
except those they were wearing when
j they went to the football game Sat
urday.
The building was empty when
smoke was seen pouring from the
roof about 4:15 p.m. by Earl Laduc,
a Corporation Yard truck driver,
| who was near Stern Hall. He hur
ried up to the corner of Salvatierra
and Arguello streets, and turned
in the alarm from the box at that
corner.
The house is located across the
street north of the Chi Psi House and
is just west of the Women's Rest
Home.
Three Stanford fire engines, in
cluding one called from the Stadium,
rushed to the rooming house, which
was burning dangerously by the
j time they arrived.
Firemen forced way to the

second floor and battled the inferno
which seemed to center in a narrow
winding staircase leading to the third
floor attic apartment.
By the time the flames had sub
sided, there were four firemen, in
cluding three part-time student
firemen, on the injured list.
