# Yanks, Bosox Sweep Twin Bills
## 
### 
Veteran Allie Reynolds and the
sensational rookie Whitey Ford
teamed up to bring the New York
Yankees one step nearer the Ameri
can League Hag yesterday as they
pitched the Bombers to a twin win
over the Washington Senators, 8 to
3, and 7 to 4. The double win in
creased the Yanks' lead to 3Va games
over the idle Detroit Tigers. As
usual Joe Dimaggio led the attack
with five hits in the two games to
boost his batting average up to a
hefty .304. It was Ford's ninth vic
tory without a setback.

| Meanwhile, the powerful Boston
I Red Sox picked up a half-game on
| the Tigers and stayed four games off
j the pace as they shut out the hapless
i Philadelphia Athletics twice. Lefty
j Mel Parnell fashioned a neat three
hitter to take his 18th victory of the
' year in the first game, while Dodger
castoff Harry Tayior made his first
j start in a Boston uniform an auspi-
I cious one as he stopped the A's with
| two hits in the nightcap.
In the senior loop, the Philadel
phia Phillies continued to stagger

toward the pennant as they split a
twin-bill v/ith the Boston Braves.
After ancient Kenny Heintzleman
had breezed to a 12 to 4 victory for
the Phillies, ex-Coast Leaguer Max
Surkont turned back the league
leaders, 5 to 3. The Brooklyn Dodg
ers moved to 4Va games of the Phils
as the little southpaw, Preacher Roe,
gained his 19th win of the campaign
over the Bums' arch foes, the New
York Giants. The win mathematic
ally eliminated the Giants from the
National League race.
