### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Surprises were the order of the !
day last Saturday as the curtain |
was raised on the 1950 Pacific Coast

Stanford's heralded Indians, the I
predicted star of the show, failed to
| impress in the first scene as they 1
I took a lack-luster, 33 to 16, win
| over San Jose State; at least four J
i of the Cards' future opponents, on
the other hand, displayed surpris- |
[ ing early-season power to gain the
j first week's spotlight.
California's Golden Bears, for ex
| ample, served advance notice of their
I intention to be cn stage when the
1 final curtain is rung down in Pasa
| denu New Year's Day.
Olszewski Sharp
The Bears, sparked by their much
ballyhooed sophomore fullback
Johnny Olszewski, erased an early 9

to a power-backed backfield that
could develop into Cal's best in years.

[ Santa Clara, too, turned up with
!an unexpectedly powerful attack.
| Making their debut under a new head
; man, ex-Clevelander Dick Galla
gher, the Broncs operated efficiently
| and smoothly behind the Cleveland
j Brown patters. But it was the same
! story, umpteenth verse —Cal had U>o
I many horses.

Olszewski Sharp
The Bears, sparked by their much
ballyhooed sophomore fullback
Johnny Olszewski, erased an early 9
to 0 Santa Clara lead to tame the
Broncos 27 to 9 at Berkeley. As
usual, Pappy Waldorf's squad
showed plenty of depth, in addition
to a power-backed backfield that
could develop into Cal's best in years.

!an unexpectedly powerful attack.

many a long scoring jaunt to his
credit, added a 91-yard sprint to his
record in. the day's highlight.
