# Schwartz Unhappy After Spartan Tilt
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Marchie Schwartz admitted read
ily Saturday afternoon that he was
disappointed in his team's show
ing against the Spartans of San
Jose State, "especially in our block
ing."
But the dapper Indian mentor
was willing to make some conces
sions to the concededly fine play of
the lower-Peninsula squad. In oth
er words, Schwartz explained, it's
difficult to determine just how good
a team the Indians were up against.
"I saw some excellent defensive
play on the part of San Jose. They
were hitting hard, tackling good,
and were very hard to run against."
The Farm chief, rarely given Bto
alibis, departed from normal form
long enough to mention that "we
have a tough game coming up next
week against USF. and that's the
one we've been pointing for. San
Jose had a definite advantage in
being "up" against us.
Essegian Wins Praise
A'though Schwartz feels that the
fullback slot is "a position we have
to do a lot of work on," he did sin
gle out the running of ex-Menlo JC
star Chuck Essegian for special
praise.
Joe St. Geme, who sparkled at
defensive halfback, and fleet offen
sive half Bob Bryan were others
who received special mention by
their coach.
