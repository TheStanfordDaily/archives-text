# Reg Figures Drop--—But Lines Aren't Any Shorter
## This Morning's Headlines UN Moves Defense Line Across Korea 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Sept. 27—
American forces threw a 200-mile
defense line all the way across Ko
rea today and sent a fresh Marine
regiment into Seoul to smash Com
munist holdouts in the center of the
city.
The northern and southern
prongs of the giant American pin
cers snapped shut at 11 p.m. Tues
day when U.S. First Cavalrymen
swept up from southeast Korea to a
junction with the U.S. Seventh Di
vision near Suwon.
Reinforcements following the
American tank spearhead closed a
trap on an estimated six Commu
nist divisions south of Seoul. It
was another spectacular success in
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's cam
paign to chew up the North Korean
army south of the 38th parallel.
In Seoul other Americans ad
vanced into the heart of the city,
hoping to break the last Commu
nist resistance. The fighting still
was bitter, although Mac Arthur an
nounced yesterday that Seoul had
been recaptured.
The Seventh Marine Regiment
this morning opened a flank attack
on the Reds holed up in alleyways,
hotels, stores, schools, and even
churches. The regiment had moved
into position Monday and Tuesday
along the northwest and northern
approaches to the South Korean
capital.
Fanatical Reds making a last
gasp fight crouched in a maze of
buildings just south of Duk Soo
Palace. Choking clouds of smoke
hung low over the burning city,
which thundered with explosions
from the Communists' ammunition
and oil stores.
