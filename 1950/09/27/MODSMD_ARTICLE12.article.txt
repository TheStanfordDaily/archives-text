Continental army, as proposed by

Germany and elsewhere. The coun

should be enabled to contribute to
the build-up of defense of Western
Europe, and having noted that the
occupying powers were studying the
matter, requested the defense com
mittee to make recommendations at
the earliest possible date as to the
methods by which Germany could
most usefully make its contribution."
