Galvcz Street in the men's dorm
area will probably be open to traffic
Friday. Escondido in front of Stern
Hall may also be open at tbis time,
according to A!f E. Brandin, Uni
versity business manager.
Repair of the two roads was part
of a $32,600 project begun at the
end of July and was one of many
improvement projects carried on at
Stanford during the vacation. Ear
ly thsi week workmen began laying
the final layer of pavement.
The intersection of Escondido and
Galvez will be closed for repairs
when Escondido is opened.
A poor base delayed work on the
roads, carrying the repairs into the
fall quarter.
Several of the University park
ing lots have been oiled and recon
ditioned. These include the Encina-
Toyon lot, the Stern lot, and the
Women's Gym lot.
On the Inner Quad, workmen are

bringing to completion the rebuild
ing of the sections formerly occu
pied by the Law School. One of the
three buildings in this group should
be completed every two weeks be
ginning October 1. All administra
tive offices now housed in the tem
porary buildings behind the library
as well as the student accounts and
cashier's office, now in Encina, will
be moved into the buildings as they
are completed.
Statistics and mathematics offices
and classes formerly housed at the
i Knoll will be moved into the tem
porary buildings, along with the
! Western Civilization library and
, part of the new Geography Dc
j partment. The present Civ Libe at
the History corner will be used for
classroom and economics office
1 space.
A total of $225,000 was budgeted
for the Inner Quad renovation.
I Oher improvements include:

A new overhead crane in the Mi
crowave Laboratory, almost com- j
pletcd.
Two new wells to augment the j
University's water supply.
Repainting and relighting of the
Biology Building.
Outside the University proper,
the installation of a six-foot pipe
for the San Francisco water system
south of Lathrop Hill in back of the
campus has been completed. Work
men are now tunneling through La
throp Hill toward the 17th green of
the golf course, while another sec
tion of the line is being laid from i
the north. â€¢
Eventually, the 16th and 16th
fairways will be dug up to put the
pipe through.
On Alpine Road, workmen arc
preparing the roadbed for paving.
Bridges are in and many of the
curves have been straightened out
| by the work.
