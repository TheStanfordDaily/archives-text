# Students Warned To Register Cars
## 
### 
All students or staff members living
either on or off campus who own cars
must register them at the Police De
partment, Chief of Policc Gordon
Davis said yesterday.
Registration will continue without
charge for the next few weeks. The
information requested includes the
owner's name, local address, home
address, license number, body style
and color, year and state.
The police department is located
just inside the east entrance of the
Corporation Yard, behind the Fire
house.
Cars registered last, year which still
have the stickers on the rear window
do not have to be registered again.
The purpose of this registration is to
make easier identification of Stanford
cars on campus, explained Davis.
