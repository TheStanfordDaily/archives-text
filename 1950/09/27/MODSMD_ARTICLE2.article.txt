WASHINGTON, Sept. 2(5 — Men
26 to 3S years old will not be draft
er! in the "foreseeable future" and
men over 35 probably will not be
called at all, Col. Daniel O. Omer,
general counsel of the Selective
Service System, said today.
He told a Farm Labor Committee
meeting on manpower problems
that men in the 19-through-25 age
group, including World War II vet
erans, should be called in the draft
before any older or younger men
are summoned.
He also urged stricter occupa
tional deferments for men in the
19-25 group, and said the Army
may lower its physical, mental, and
moral standards for them.
Selective Service Director Lewis
R. Hershey said Monday that he is
opposed to raising the maximum
draft age to 35 and thinks the
armed services should take all the
youngest before moving to the top
age groups.
