# Total Is Below '49 Level As 7,343 Sign Reg Books
## 
### 
That high first day registration figures mean little was shown
yesterday as Stanford's final registration figure of 7,343 showed
a decrease of 247 students below last fall's totals.
Officials were puzzled Monday as to what the outcome would
be when 4,360 men and 1,592 women jammed the pavilion on that

first day of registration. This was
a gain of 250 over last year.
Comparatively few people turned
up at the basketball arena yester
day, however, and as a result the
grand totals took a tumble with
the present count some 15 Ostudentr,
below the reg figure of 7,500 pre
dieted by University officials lait
week.
Broken down, the totals this year
showed 5,435 men and 1,908 worn -
en, while last year there were 5,768
men and 1,824 women.
The enrollment decrease — espe
daily in male students—shifted the
Stanford ratio of 1949-50 from 3 '/ '
to a more equitable 2.75:1. Tin.
ratio equals the present freshman
ratio.
Late fees of $2 will be charged
students who did not return I hen
reg books by 5:30 p.m. yesterday
This $2 fee will be charged to thos?
who are one and two days late,
while a $5 late fee will be charged
after the second day until the en'l
of the first week, and $10 will be
invoked thereafter.
Students will begin registering
for physical education courses to
day. All lower division men who
are not exempt are required to en -
roll. Women will register in the
Women's Gym and men in the
Physical Education Building.
