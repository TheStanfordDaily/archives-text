# Excom—Chapter 1
## 
### 
Student government at Stanford shifts into
gear tonight for the first time this year as Excom
meets in the Old Union.
As it has developed throughout the years,
this governing body has come to be probably
the leading exponent of the democratic ideal
on the Farm. Representatives of classes and
hving areas have debated and voted accord
ing to personal convictions, the desires of their
constituents, and sometimes on-the-spot whims.
For many, Excom represents a kind of
"sounding board" for puzzles and plans of stu
dent organizations within the ASSU. The ex
change of ideas among the 15 voting members
of Excom, related committees and boards pro
vides many opportunities for progress in stu
dent government.
No student officer can be expected to be
perfect. The problems which are thrown on
the table up in the Excom room are ones which
can be solved only by clear thinking and tire
less research.
Foremost of the student body officers is the
ASSU president. Under his guidance student
government can show its colors at the front of
the pack—or it can fade back to an also ran.
The ASSU prexy can be a man who holds his
office from day to day merely trying to keep
from making mistakes and crossing the wrong
people.

Or he can be a hard-spined leader who takes
that extra step—at the risk of some criticism—
in order tb put over a new plan or to experiment
with different ideas.
One of these student body presidents is con
servative, one is liberal.
In order to make a student organization oper
ate efficiently, we must certainly have a leader
who makes a minimum of mistakes in his policy
decisions.
But to have that extra.push that means prog
ress in education, in social policy, and in better
housing and living conditions on campus, the
ASSU president must have the liberal attitude
which encourages necessary changes in stu
dent administrative action.
Last year, democratic government on the
Farm reached a zenith, or close to such a point.
The ideas of a Student-Faculty Educational
Committee, a faculty rating system, senior
seminars, and the charity poll, were born.
The growth of these proposals depends on
this year's Excom. They can be placed on the
agenda early this fall and put into operation
almost immediately. Or they can get the
"table" treatment which similar worthwhile
resolutions have received, and never be put
into effect.
The procedure is in the hands of our lead
ers. Their actions reflect the students' interests.

No student officer can be expected to be
perfect. The problems which are thrown on
the table up in the Excom room are ones which
can be solved only by clear thinking and tire
less research.
Foremost of the student body officers is the
ASSU president. Under his guidance student
government can show its colors at the front of
the pack—or it can fade back to an also ran.
The ASSU prexy can be a man who holds his
office from day to day merely trying to keep
from making mistakes and crossing the wrong
people.

Or he can be a hard-spined leader who takes
that extra step—at the risk of some criticism—
in order tb put over a new plan or to experiment
with different ideas.
One of these student body presidents is con
servative, one is liberal.
In order to make a student organization oper
ate efficiently, we must certainly have a leader
who makes a minimum of mistakes in his policy
decisions.
But to have that extra.push that means prog
ress in education, in social policy, and in better
housing and living conditions on campus, the
ASSU president must have the liberal attitude
which encourages necessary changes in stu
dent administrative action.
Last year, democratic government on the
Farm reached a zenith, or close to such a point.
The ideas of a Student-Faculty Educational
Committee, a faculty rating system, senior
seminars, and the charity poll, were born.
The growth of these proposals depends on
this year's Excom. They can be placed on the
agenda early this fall and put into operation
almost immediately. Or they can get the
"table" treatment which similar worthwhile
resolutions have received, and never be put
into effect.
The procedure is in the hands of our lead
ers. Their actions reflect the students' interests.
