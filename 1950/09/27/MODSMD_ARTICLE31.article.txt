### VIC PALMIERI 
1 hate to sound like an intellectual snob but I'm not
going minus this fall. The few minutes it will take me
to write this are going to change the picture entirely
(my first column changed the picture pretty much too
—1 came back from registration and found my bags on
the lawn with a goodbye note from the brothers and
an envelope from my girl with my car keys in it . . .
1 wondered if she really loved me when she wanted
to be "keyed" instead of "pinned".
But I never could understand why my grades
dropped so much further beneath the All Moles' Aver
age autumn quarter than they do in spring or winter
(you've heard of "from bad to worse"? Well this is
from "stinkin" to "dammit, father, you hit me again
and I swear I'll make more than 500 stones next sum
mer!")
So finally one day I stood on my head against the
wall (yeah ... I know you can do it in the middle of
the room) and started thinking. And almost before
my nose started bleeding I came down with the answer.
It all starts the day you get back to campus and
everybody greets you with the same old question—
"Have a good time this summer?" This doesn't take
much time cause only one guy in Stanford history was
ever heard to answer anything but "terrific!," and he
never amounted to a hoot.
But the next one can get you and they'll hit you
with it faster than the trustees can raise tuition. This
one is labeled, "Wha'd yuh do?" and the answer can
range from "aw, just fooled around" to a tale that'd
make even Lili Marlene blush (any gal who's spent

ns much time around an Army barracks as long as she
has is hard to laze).
OK, now my point is, first of all, that these things
take time. You figure there are some 8000 people at
Stanford. After you've been here five or six years
you get to know at least two or three thousand of them
to speak to—that is if you don't mind being spit at
when you look like you expected an answer.
So even if you only speak to guys in Block S sweaters
and girls with fraternity pins (it took me three years
to find out that fraternities have men in them too) . . .
you still have about 2500 people to cope with on the
subject of your summer and theirs. At a conservative
estimate of 10 minutes a crack, it adds up to a total of
416 hours ... or nearly 35 days!!!!
As the Republican said when he got up to speak at
the Legion smoker . . . "Let's look at the figures!"
Trouble is, by the time you've seen everybody and said
hello its finals week! What can you do then but rack
out at Rossott's and wait for the axe? . . . (ok, pop,
stop shouting . . . you didn't send me to college to be
a hermit, did you . . .").
But what's really sad is that by the time I've gone
through this little song and dance ten or fifteen times
I start wondering about your "terrific" summer . . .
and discover maybe it wasn't so hot after all . .1
didn't go anywhere special . . . and I worked like a
dog practically till August . . . and the only two dates
I had were arranged by my mother ... so I go into an
emotional funk and spend the rest of the quarter in the
bio lab watching fruit flies . . . they have all the fun
. . . (I know ... I count 'em every week).
