# Chappie Wants People, Too
## 
### 
The Stanford Chaparral wants
you.
That is, if you can write, draw,
take photographs, sell ads, read,
add, subtract, scrub floors, or drink
milk.
The oldest college humor maga
zine west of the Appalachians has
plenty of opportunities for ad
vancement on the editorial side, if
you want glory, and on the busi
ness end, if you want experience,
valuable Bay Area contacts, and a
cut in the profits.
It also offers membership in the
Hammer and Coffin Society, the 44-
year-old honorary humor society
that owns and operates the maga
zine, or in the II & C Women's
Auxiliary, a group which provides
aid and inspiration to the members
of the Chaparral staff.
Just walk into the Chappie office
any afternoon and offer your serv
ices to Stan Norton, the Old Boy,
or John Motheral, the rag's penny
squeezing business manager. Don't
let the Chappies frighten you. Af
ter all, they're only subhuman.
