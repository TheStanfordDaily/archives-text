# How Carnival Set For Friday the 13th
## 
### 
Unlucky Friday the thirteenth of
October has been set as the date of
the annual Row Carnival, Chair
man Ann Jameson said yesterday
as she and her committee started
laying plans for the benefit event.
To fit in with the date, the over-all
theme will be "Superstitions."
Money taken in from the carnival
will finance a scholarship to be
awarded to a woman from one of
the nine Row houses.
Feature attraction on Lower Row,
where the festivities will be staged,
will be an auction. In previous
years Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler has served as auctioneer.
Other booths and entertainment
places will include a fun house, a
taxi-dance, music, games, movies,
and food.
