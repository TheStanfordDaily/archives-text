### 
Names of 12 additional students
who were graduated with honors
from Stanford University in June
have been announced by Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling.
Their names have been added to
the list of 68 students who were
graduated "with great distinction"
and 108 who were graduated "with
distinction" when diplomas were
awarded to 1,582 undergraduates
last June.
Delay in announcement that the
12 students graduated with honors
was necessary because final grades
for their law courses were not
available when the original list was
compiled in May.
Students graduating "with great
distinction" are in the top five per
cent oi their class. Those graduat
ing "with distinction" are in the
next 10 per cent.
