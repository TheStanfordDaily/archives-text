Quote of the Week: "Jeez, Coach, if we could play that game over again,
we'd really whip those guys."—San Jose guard John Harding after Stanford's
33-1G win.
I think that the exhibition in the Stanford Stadium last Saturday de
serves a word of explanation for those who didn't see it, and for those who
didn't like what they saw if they did see it. Which just about includes every
body.
In my opinion, Coach Marchie Schwartz tried to make his team look as
bad as possible that second half vs. the Spartans. This isn't treason, it's smart
coaching. Schwartz, from every indication, is determined to make the Injun
fellas go all the way this year, in spite of the fact that they are the most over
rated team in the country. (Or so it appears at this point.) Marchie remem
bers well that last year we won our openers vs. SJS and the cry-babies from
the small Eastern school near Boston by scores of 49-0 and 44-0. This rich
diet did not prove too healthful for the 11 little Indians. They didn't get
cocky, but down deep inside they began to feel that they were performing
better than they actually were. This and boo-coo press raves set them up
for the big market crash that came with the hard-hitting Michigunders (27-
7) and the pretty-blue Bruins of UCLA (14-7).
Marchie, I think, was making sure that this didn't happen again. Hie
decadent rush of pre-season raves about Stanford—from men who haven't
seen us play since ShaUghnessy left —could easily have set the Cards up for
another tragic mid-season collapse when the going got tough. And believe
me, kids, the going is going to get very tough.
Thus, the Headman insured himself victory with a great second-quar
ter scoring blitz, and then proceeded to show the team just how unprepared
for the big boys they were. At half-time he told the team that there would
be absolutely no passing the second half. The qbs, Kerkorian and Hoim,
followed instructions and SJS shifted in a tough-to-crack eight-man line.
Kesult? We looked terrible. Further result? The Stanford redphirts
learned for themselves that their blocking stunk and that their reserves
were going to have to come a long way before the Big Boys (USC, Army,
Cal) came along to batter them.
1 think Stanford could have beaten the Spartans by a respectable 75 points
had Schwartz been so inclined. But they would have had to do it entirely
via the air. That would have hurt Stanford more than it would San Jose#
As it is now, the team realizes that they have a spot of work to do—especially
in offensive blocking and pass defense.
I think we can expect the Iniuns to be vastly improved, in both depart
ments, come kick-off time next Saturday. The team, this week, is working
on clever ideas on how to stop Ollie Matson, USF's great back. If they are
successful the Ililltoppers will have a worse time of it next week than
SJS had last.
Now for the season's prognostications. These pre-season dope sheets are
never very accurate, but they are always a lot of fun to make. If you don't
like them, stop reading here because Berry's peerless picks will probably
fill up the rest of the column.
Stanford over San Jose State by 17 points. This is an easy pick for me.
You inexperienced people couldn't do it, but we Daily columnists. Ah!
Stanford over USF by 21 points. Matson will probably score on a long run
or two, but the Indians would like to go up to Corvallis with a good game
under their belts. Too much power for the Hilltoppers to handle.
Stanford over OSC by 14 points. The Indians with two wins under their
wigwams should make good the Beaver invasion. OSC will go into the game
with one big loss behind them. Kerkorian to McColl.
Stanford over Santa Clara by 28. Losing most of the first team, plus
Haynes, plus their coach, Len Casanova, makes the Broncos of the non
bucking variety. Stanford gets first SC win since 1946.
Stanford over UCLA by 1 point. They love us in the Coliseum. Don't
think that even the Sanders-loaded Bruins can stop that passing. Besides,
we need a bit of that revenge stuff. Those baby-blue boys ruined us last
year.
Stanford over Washington by 14. The Huskies' great passing attack will
be rough stuff, but they don't have it up front again this year. I think Wash
ington, like Stanford, is overrated this trip.
Southern California over Stanford by 7. You can't win 'em all. The Stan
ford game is the big one for the Trojans this year. We hurt their feelings
last season. Too much power and too much depth will tell a sad story in the
closing minutes of play. Would sure like to be wrong on this one.
Stanford over Washington State by 3ft. No contest in spite of USC-ac
quired injuries.
Army over Stanford by 21. We, in spite of that chap Wallace who lost his
mind in the pages of Collier's, aren't in the same league with the Cadets.
We'll give them a helluva tussle and could conceivably upset them. But
good sense suggests that the Foldbcrgs, Stevensons, Pollards, Cains, etc., will
give the Blaikmcn a good afternoon in Senator Stanford's Stadium.
Stanford over California by 14. We had the Axe when I got Tnerc, we'll
have it when I leave. Cal will have boo-coo trouble with our passing. The
SOB's have been lucky too long.
That gives Stanford an 8-2-0 record. Which is respectable, even though
it does put USC in the Rose Bowl. One consolation here. Prediction of
Rose Bowl game: Michigan 40, USC ft.

Stanford over OSC by 14 points. The Indians with two wins under their
wigwams should make good the Beaver invasion. OSC will go into the game
with one big loss behind them. Kerkorian to McColl.
Stanford over Santa Clara by 28. Losing most of the first team, plus
Haynes, plus their coach, Len Casanova, makes the Broncos of the non
bucking variety. Stanford gets first SC win since 1946.
Stanford over UCLA by 1 point. They love us in the Coliseum. Don't
think that even the Sanders-loaded Bruins can stop that passing. Besides,
we need a bit of that revenge stuff. Those baby-blue boys ruined us last
year.
Stanford over Washington by 14. The Huskies' great passing attack will
be rough stuff, but they don't have it up front again this year. I think Wash
ington, like Stanford, is overrated this trip.
Southern California over Stanford by 7. You can't win 'em all. The Stan
ford game is the big one for the Trojans this year. We hurt their feelings
last season. Too much power and too much depth will tell a sad story in the
closing minutes of play. Would sure like to be wrong on this one.
Stanford over Washington State by 3ft. No contest in spite of USC-ac
quired injuries.
Army over Stanford by 21. We, in spite of that chap Wallace who lost his
mind in the pages of Collier's, aren't in the same league with the Cadets.
We'll give them a helluva tussle and could conceivably upset them. But
good sense suggests that the Foldbcrgs, Stevensons, Pollards, Cains, etc., will
give the Blaikmcn a good afternoon in Senator Stanford's Stadium.
Stanford over California by 14. We had the Axe when I got Tnerc, we'll
have it when I leave. Cal will have boo-coo trouble with our passing. The
SOB's have been lucky too long.
That gives Stanford an 8-2-0 record. Which is respectable, even though
it does put USC in the Rose Bowl. One consolation here. Prediction of
Rose Bowl game: Michigan 40, USC ft.
Quote of the Week: "Jeez, Coach, if we could play that game over again,
we'd really whip those guys."—San Jose guard John Harding after Stanford's
33-1G win.
I think that the exhibition in the Stanford Stadium last Saturday de
serves a word of explanation for those who didn't see it, and for those who
didn't like what they saw if they did see it. Which just about includes every
body.
In my opinion, Coach Marchie Schwartz tried to make his team look as
bad as possible that second half vs. the Spartans. This isn't treason, it's smart
coaching. Schwartz, from every indication, is determined to make the Injun
fellas go all the way this year, in spite of the fact that they are the most over
rated team in the country. (Or so it appears at this point.) Marchie remem
bers well that last year we won our openers vs. SJS and the cry-babies from
the small Eastern school near Boston by scores of 49-0 and 44-0. This rich
diet did not prove too healthful for the 11 little Indians. They didn't get
cocky, but down deep inside they began to feel that they were performing
better than they actually were. This and boo-coo press raves set them up
for the big market crash that came with the hard-hitting Michigunders (27-
7) and the pretty-blue Bruins of UCLA (14-7).
Marchie, I think, was making sure that this didn't happen again. Hie
decadent rush of pre-season raves about Stanford—from men who haven't
seen us play since ShaUghnessy left —could easily have set the Cards up for
another tragic mid-season collapse when the going got tough. And believe
me, kids, the going is going to get very tough.
Thus, the Headman insured himself victory with a great second-quar
ter scoring blitz, and then proceeded to show the team just how unprepared
for the big boys they were. At half-time he told the team that there would
be absolutely no passing the second half. The qbs, Kerkorian and Hoim,
followed instructions and SJS shifted in a tough-to-crack eight-man line.
Kesult? We looked terrible. Further result? The Stanford redphirts
learned for themselves that their blocking stunk and that their reserves
were going to have to come a long way before the Big Boys (USC, Army,
Cal) came along to batter them.
1 think Stanford could have beaten the Spartans by a respectable 75 points
had Schwartz been so inclined. But they would have had to do it entirely
via the air. That would have hurt Stanford more than it would San Jose#
As it is now, the team realizes that they have a spot of work to do—especially
in offensive blocking and pass defense.
I think we can expect the Iniuns to be vastly improved, in both depart
ments, come kick-off time next Saturday. The team, this week, is working
on clever ideas on how to stop Ollie Matson, USF's great back. If they are
successful the Ililltoppers will have a worse time of it next week than
SJS had last.
Now for the season's prognostications. These pre-season dope sheets are
never very accurate, but they are always a lot of fun to make. If you don't
like them, stop reading here because Berry's peerless picks will probably
fill up the rest of the column.

You inexperienced people couldn't do it, but we Daily columnists. Ah!

decadent rush of pre-season raves about Stanford—from men who haven't
seen us play since ShaUghnessy left —could easily have set the Cards up for
another tragic mid-season collapse when the going got tough. And believe
me, kids, the going is going to get very tough.
Thus, the Headman insured himself victory with a great second-quar
ter scoring blitz, and then proceeded to show the team just how unprepared
for the big boys they were. At half-time he told the team that there would
be absolutely no passing the second half. The qbs, Kerkorian and Hoim,
followed instructions and SJS shifted in a tough-to-crack eight-man line.
Kesult? We looked terrible. Further result? The Stanford redphirts
learned for themselves that their blocking stunk and that their reserves
were going to have to come a long way before the Big Boys (USC, Army,
Cal) came along to batter them.
1 think Stanford could have beaten the Spartans by a respectable 75 points
had Schwartz been so inclined. But they would have had to do it entirely
via the air. That would have hurt Stanford more than it would San Jose#
As it is now, the team realizes that they have a spot of work to do—especially
in offensive blocking and pass defense.
I think we can expect the Iniuns to be vastly improved, in both depart
ments, come kick-off time next Saturday. The team, this week, is working
on clever ideas on how to stop Ollie Matson, USF's great back. If they are
successful the Ililltoppers will have a worse time of it next week than
SJS had last.
Now for the season's prognostications. These pre-season dope sheets are
never very accurate, but they are always a lot of fun to make. If you don't
like them, stop reading here because Berry's peerless picks will probably
fill up the rest of the column.
Stanford over San Jose State by 17 points. This is an easy pick for me.
You inexperienced people couldn't do it, but we Daily columnists. Ah!
Stanford over USF by 21 points. Matson will probably score on a long run
or two, but the Indians would like to go up to Corvallis with a good game
under their belts. Too much power for the Hilltoppers to handle.
Stanford over OSC by 14 points. The Indians with two wins under their
Quote of the Week: "Jeez, Coach, if we could play that game over again,
we'd really whip those guys."—San Jose guard John Harding after Stanford's
33-1G win.
I think that the exhibition in the Stanford Stadium last Saturday de
serves a word of explanation for those who didn't see it, and for those who
didn't like what they saw if they did see it. Which just about includes every
body.
In my opinion, Coach Marchie Schwartz tried to make his team look as
bad as possible that second half vs. the Spartans. This isn't treason, it's smart
coaching. Schwartz, from every indication, is determined to make the Injun
fellas go all the way this year, in spite of the fact that they are the most over
rated team in the country. (Or so it appears at this point.) Marchie remem
bers well that last year we won our openers vs. SJS and the cry-babies from
the small Eastern school near Boston by scores of 49-0 and 44-0. This rich
diet did not prove too healthful for the 11 little Indians. They didn't get
cocky, but down deep inside they began to feel that they were performing
better than they actually were. This and boo-coo press raves set them up
for the big market crash that came with the hard-hitting Michigunders (27-
7) and the pretty-blue Bruins of UCLA (14-7).

Stanford over OSC by 14 points. The Indians with two wins under their
wigwams should make good the Beaver invasion. OSC will go into the game
with one big loss behind them. Kerkorian to McColl.
Stanford over Santa Clara by 28. Losing most of the first team, plus
Haynes, plus their coach, Len Casanova, makes the Broncos of the non
bucking variety. Stanford gets first SC win since 1946.
Stanford over UCLA by 1 point. They love us in the Coliseum. Don't
think that even the Sanders-loaded Bruins can stop that passing. Besides,
we need a bit of that revenge stuff. Those baby-blue boys ruined us last
year.
Stanford over Washington by 14. The Huskies' great passing attack will
be rough stuff, but they don't have it up front again this year. I think Wash
ington, like Stanford, is overrated this trip.
Southern California over Stanford by 7. You can't win 'em all. The Stan
ford game is the big one for the Trojans this year. We hurt their feelings
last season. Too much power and too much depth will tell a sad story in the
closing minutes of play. Would sure like to be wrong on this one.
Stanford over Washington State by 3ft. No contest in spite of USC-ac
quired injuries.
Army over Stanford by 21. We, in spite of that chap Wallace who lost his
mind in the pages of Collier's, aren't in the same league with the Cadets.
We'll give them a helluva tussle and could conceivably upset them. But
good sense suggests that the Foldbcrgs, Stevensons, Pollards, Cains, etc., will
give the Blaikmcn a good afternoon in Senator Stanford's Stadium.
Stanford over California by 14. We had the Axe when I got Tnerc, we'll
have it when I leave. Cal will have boo-coo trouble with our passing. The
SOB's have been lucky too long.
That gives Stanford an 8-2-0 record. Which is respectable, even though
it does put USC in the Rose Bowl. One consolation here. Prediction of
Rose Bowl game: Michigan 40, USC ft.
