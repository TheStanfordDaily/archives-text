## SOCCER Four Vets Lead Way 
### JIM MADISON 
Assistant Dick Long will issue
equipment at 4 p.m. today to open
Stanford's 1950 soccer season. Four
lettermen head the list of 22 stal
warts who have already answered
the call to play this international
sport.
Included are Jim Knowles, Jeff
Moreshead, Bud McCord, and soph
omore start Harry Havilio, who
amazed everyone last year with his
ability to hit 'em with his head as
well as his feet.
Since more manpower is needed,
anyone who is desirous of playing
is encouraged to sign up for P.E.
139 this afternoon. Coach Major
Graham especially requests foreign
students with previous experience,
frosh, and grad students to turn out,
as they are all eligible to letter in
this sport.
The soccer squad also needs a
man who is interested in earning
his letter by working as manager.
Stanford will play three of their
games under the arcs in a new San
Francisco stadium, and negotiations
are under way for televising several
of the top contests.
Coach Graham played four years
at Penn State from 1931 to 1935.
During that time the Nittany Lions
were national champions in 1934
and Major Graham was All-Amer
ica left-fullback in 1935.
One of the several new gimmicks
to be used this year is a soccer
volleyball court which will give the
aspirants training playing volley
ball with their heads instead of
their hands.
