### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 26 (UP)—An
cient Joe Louis was favored at 9
to 5 today to beat fragile-bodied
Ezzard Charles in their strange bat
tle of misfits for the heavyweight
championship at Yankee Stadium
tomorrow night.
The big question was who would
collapse first—Louis from his bur
den of 36 years or Charles from
body punishment.
If ex - champion Louis retains
enough of his former prowess to
beat brown - skinned Charles of
Cincinnati, he will be the first man
in heavyweight history to recap
ture the crown. He will have suc
ceeded where such greats as Jack
Dempsey, James J. Jeffries, and
Bob FitzSimmons failed.
At least 30,000 fans were expected
to pay at least $250,000 to see the
popular bomber Joe make the big
try, after two years' absence from
the ring. Fans sympathize with the
once-great Negro who comes out of
retirement, with a bald spot on his
head, to fight for income-tax mon
ey. During his remarkable career
the most destructive puncher in
heavyweight history earned more
than $4,000,000. But now he is suf
fering from the "shorts."
