# Fall Registration Rush Brings On Record Lines
## 
### WALT MENNINGER 
New Stanford students were quick in learning their P's and
Queues as the rush for books and registration brought on record
sized lines the last two days.
Considered by students the most irritating line in time, length,
and pressure, was the one at the Stanford Bookstore which at one

time stretched 100 feet around the
corner of Lasuen and Escondido
across from the Ed Building.
"We can't explain this extreme
rush and have no way to combat it,"
said Mrs. Helena Bauchou, Book
store manager. "It just seems that
everybody is hurrying to get his
books the first few days." Substan
tiating her claims, Mrs. Bauchou
pointed out that Monday's and
j Tuesday's sales were the largest in
! the Bookstore's history.
She also agreed with junior Bob
| Forderhase, who waited one and a
half hours Tuesday for four books,
that the only solution to the prob
lem would be a new bookstore. Said
i Mrs. Bauchou, the present Book-
I store was built to accommodate
! 3,500 students.
Students were meanwhile mak
ing the best of the situation, as evi
denced by card games and other
time-passing activities in the line.
Freshman Bud Lamborn, a two
hour veteran, suggested that Dai
lies be provided to be read "or sat
on, however the case may be."
The big mystery among adminis
j tration officials was the rush Mon
j day afternoon for registration at the
Pavilion and the comparative emp
tiness there Tuesday.
At 3 o'clock Monday afternoon,
the west half of the Pavilion was
suddenly jammed with the largest
crowd at the cashiers' windows in
the last five years, according to
J Duncan McFadden, University con
troller.
This jam was probably caused by
three reasons, said McFadden, the
first being the decrease of veteran
students without an overall de
crease in enrollment, meaning more
cash students than ever before.
Secondly, more checks in excess of
\ the tuition cost were received this
\ year, so that twice the University
(cashiers ran completely out of cash,
j The third cause for the record
jamming was the record class of '54
who packed the east end of the Pa

vilion signing class lists. Most
freshmen spent from two and a half
to three hours in registering, and
many discovered that classes which
were closed Monday night were
open again Tuesday morning.
With the extreme rush taken care
of Monday, students who had the
foresight to skip registering then
breezed through the procedure yes
terday.
