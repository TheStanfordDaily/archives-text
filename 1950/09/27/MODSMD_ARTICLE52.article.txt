## 
### AL BERRY 
"The Men," currently blessing the
screen of Menlo Park's largest theater,
rates, in our mind, as a coin-flip toss
up with "Sunset Blvd" as the best
domestic motion picture of 1950.
Groping for Academy Award hon
ors for his portrayal of a war-scared
paraplegic, is Marlon Brando, a trans
fer to Hollywood U. from the Broad
way hit "A Streetcar Named Desire."
Also on the laud list are Teresa
Wright, as the paralized veteran's
wife, Everett Sloane as Dr. Brock and
a chap named Webb whose first name
wc did not catch.
"The Men" could, with less brilliant

direction, ih a v e
been a very dead
ly tear jerker. It
was not.lt handled
its theme — para
plegic war veter
ans — with spirit,
humor and wond
erful taste. It is thej
combination that

I makes "Men" a great motion picture.
: One grad student we were with
/thought the flick was better than
["The Best Years of Our Lives." We
| didn't, but it is a fair comparison.
It has plenty of merits. The acting,
the direction, the wonderful script
and the use of the paraplegics them
selves for the bit roles combine
to make "The Men" more humorous
than painful, more satisfying than
sad.
