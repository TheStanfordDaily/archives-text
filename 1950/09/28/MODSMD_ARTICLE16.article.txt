## Collegians: What to Do About Draft 
### 
There's more than one way for
Stanford men to postpone those
famed "greetings from the Presi
dent."
Non-veterans registered at Stan
ford this quarter can apply for tem
porary exemption from the draft
through the Men's Counseling Of
fice, said Richard L. Balch, chief
counselor for men.
Selective Service regulations cov
er two types of deferment, as fol
lows:
1. Postponement of Induction
Local Selective Service Boards
are authorized to postpone induc
tion throughout the academic year
1950-51 for students who so re
quest and who are enrolled in a
full - time course of university
study. A student who wishes to
take advantage of these provisions
should first write to his local board.
He should state that he is enrolled
at Stanford and that the Univer
sity will certify his registration and
standing if necessary.
If his local board asks him for
certification from Stanford, he
should then go to the office of the
Counselor for Men, Room 22, Tem
porary Building B. This office will
certify his standing.
In most cases, Balch said, the lo
cal board will then grant postpone
ments of induction to those stu
dents in the lower 50 per cent of
their class, academically. These
students will not be drafted before
June 17, 1951.
2. Occupational Deferment
A student may apply for occupa
tional deferment (2-A classifica
tion) if he meets the following re
quirements:
a) He has completed at least one
academic year of a full - time
course of instruction at a col
lege, university, or similar insti
tution of learning.
b) The school at which he last
completed an academic year
certifies that his standing placed
him among the tipper half of his
class.
Occupational deferment is avail
able for periods of six months,
"presumably renewable," to stu
dents who meet these conditions.
Here's the main difference between
this deferment and postponement of
induction: a man in 2-A classifica
tion may choose any branch of
service after his deferment is up; a
man whose induction has merely
been postponed remains 1-A and
will be drafted when the postpone
ment period is up.
Students who desire occupational
deferment should go through the
same steps listed above for post
ponement of induction.
Local Board Final Judge
Balch emphasized that final judg
ment is up to each local draft board
and that action varies from board
to board.
The chief counselor said that stu
dents should not apply for tempo
rary exemption simply because
I they have been classified 1-A.
j "They should wait until their board
i requests some information about
i their occupational status," he said.
"But on the other hand, they should
j apply before they have received
their notice of induction."
j If a student who desires defer
| ment does receive his induction no-
I tice, he should report to the coun
selor's office immediately. It. may
