# CAL LOYALTY OATH
## Squabble Drags On; 45 Classes Dropped 
### JOY HAAS 
As a new fall semester opens at.
the University of Calfoirnia, the old
loyalty controversy drags into its
fifteenth month.
First to feel the results of the
Regents' action were departments
employing professors who have not
' signed the loyalty declarations.
I Forty-five classes were dropped
| from the fall curriculum. Most of
' the courses were so specialized that
I finding substitutes for the non
signers was impossible.
Affected departments were ap
parently caught unprepared. As
registration day wore on, small no
tices began to appear outside the
various departments listing course
numbers that had to be canceled.
Hundreds of students were forced
to rearrange their programs and to
find other sections in crowded lec
ture courses.
Two of the country's foremost
| professors' organizations have taken
official stands on the Regents' pro
gram. The American Mathematical
Society has denounced the "loyalty
spree" and the American Psycho
logical Association has condemned
| and blacklisted the university. It
has urged its members not to work
i there and their placement agency
; refuses to assist in filling faculty
! vacancies.

Faculty members of Princeton
University and the Institute for Ad
vanced Study, including Albert
Einstein and J. Robert Oppenhei
mer, added their names to the list
of groups protesting.
In the meantime, the status of the
27 non-signers is nebulous. They
arc not teaching, they are not on
the pay roll, but they have not been
officially dismissed.
The Board of Regents voted Fri
day to extend the deadline for sign
ing the loyalty declaration for f»0
days. This action grants to nine
non-signers the same time extension
which the Third District Court of
Appeal in Sacramento has ordered
for 18 non-signers who are petition
ing the court for their reappoint
ment to the university.
Professor of economics Robert A.
Gordon met overwhelming approv
al from his first class of 050 students
when he opened his course with
these words: "... I cannot say, as
I have for so many years, that I am
proud to teach here. ... I feel
apologctic that I haven't been
fired."
He said the Communists saved his
job by marching into South Korea.
Gordon signed because he feared
the fight for academic freedom
would be confused with disloyalty.
