Campus toilets erupted with a
gurgle-gurgle yesterday as the
Farm's hack-to-school plumbing
problem was brought to a four-alarm
climax.
Two plumbers—one from Stanford
and another from the outlying dis
tricts—were called to the scene of the
worst disaster last night at 5:45 when
the basement W.C. in the Alpha Sig
ma Phi fraternity house at 534 Sal
vatierra street started backing up and
spilling on the floor.
At 7:30, the situation was brought
under control—thanks to a long wire
called a "snake" that was threaded
into the main sewer pipe to ream
out tree roots that were clogging it
up.
Three Inches Deep
Minutes after the Alpha Sig ca
tastrophe—which saw three inches of
sewer water flood a small section of
the barement—another call was re
ceived from John B. Price at 532 Al
varado Way. Price, who said ho has
trouble with his lines "about once
every six months," reported an over
flowing toilet.
Plumbers later righted the situa
tion—another case of the overly-am
bitious tree roots which Price said
"seem to swell all out of proportion
once they get inside the line."
Earlier in the day, two other Uni
versity residences repoited plumb
ing difficulties. Both Manzanita and
Mariposa houses were beset with
overflows caused by roots ingrown in
connecting sewer lines.
Three Days Running
All in all, yesterday was the third
consecutive day of headaches for the
local plumbing profession. Wryly,
plumbers reported they.had had "no
trouble" all summer.
Things started backing; up Sunday
when four campus residences sought
plumbing aid. Monday there were
three more calls and Tuesday it was
much the same story. Yesterday, as
one begrimed observer pointed out,
"things definitely came to a head—
and all on account of too darned
many trees."
We'd say the whole thing was just
another case of "back to school ad
justments." The trees are there to
slay.
