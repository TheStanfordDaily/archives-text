# Rhee on Peace Terms

TOKYO â€” President Syngman
Rhee of the Korean Republic said
today the only acceptable terms for
ending the Korean war are "un
conditional surrender of the Com
munists."
"It is up to the Korean (South
Korean) government to make any
terms of peace and our terms are
unconditional surrender," Rhee told
the United Press in a telephone in
terview.
Rhee was awakened at his resi
dence in South Korea by a tele
phone call to be told of reports that
the North Korean government was
proposing terms for an end to the
war.
