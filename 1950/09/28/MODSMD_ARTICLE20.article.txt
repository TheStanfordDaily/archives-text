# Big Game Is Big Topic At First Excom Meet
## Members Table Discussion On Thanksgiving Conflict 
### 
Plans for putting the load of pre-Big Game activities on the
Thanksgiving holidays, November 23 and 24, were presented to
Excom last night by Cardinals President Ted Hinshaw.
Since the Big Game falls on November 25, the only alternative,
Hinshaw said, would be to hold the bonfire and other events on

the Monday, Tuesday, and
day preceding the game. He said I
that if this were done spirit and in- j
terest would drop by game tim?;.
He added that Marchie Schwartz I
feels Thanksgiving Day is the best •
time to hold the rally and that the i
Administration will give all its co- |
operation to events held late in the j
week. With no classes to attend, J
students would have more time to j
build floats and the bonfire on
Thursday and Friday, Hinshaw
said.
Hut Table Decision
Excom tabled discussion until
next week, with President Ted
Buttner recommending that repre
sentatives sound out student opin
ion on the subject.
Excom unanimously passed a mo
tion that a committee be appointed
to work out a plan to conduct a
campus opinion poll, and Ed
Fleischer was appointed chairman.
Buttner said that such a poll might
be used/•to discover student inter
est in different campus activities
and student feeling on experimen
tal systems such as faculty rating.
A conference of the World Stu
dents' Service Fund to be held here
on October 14 and 15 was approved
and a welcome was extended to the
organization through lIR.
Since Union Excom representa
tive Pat Murphy did not return due
to illness, Excom approved the elec
tion by the Union units of an in
terim representative to hold office
until the next campus election.
Excom then disposed of several
financial matters including the un
derwriting of the 1951 Quad for
$1,000, and the raising of the Sun
day Evening Movie manager's sal
ary from $25 to $50 a quarter for
this year only. Distribution of 15
1949 Quads to California high
schools at the discretion of Buttner
and the Athletic Board was ap
proved.
Charter Committee Set Up
A constitutional committee was
set up to read all club charters up
for Excom approval, consisting of

and Dave Elliott. Gil Jonas and
Dot Thomas were assigned to read

time to hold the rally and that the i
Administration will give all its co- |
operation to events held late in the j
week. With no classes to attend, J
students would have more time to j
build floats and the bonfire on
Thursday and Friday, Hinshaw
said.
Hut Table Decision
Excom tabled discussion until
next week, with President Ted
Buttner recommending that repre
sentatives sound out student opin
ion on the subject.
Excom unanimously passed a mo
tion that a committee be appointed
to work out a plan to conduct a
campus opinion poll, and Ed
Fleischer was appointed chairman.
Buttner said that such a poll might
be used/•to discover student inter
est in different campus activities
and student feeling on experimen
tal systems such as faculty rating.
A conference of the World Stu
dents' Service Fund to be held here
on October 14 and 15 was approved
and a welcome was extended to the
organization through lIR.
Since Union Excom representa
tive Pat Murphy did not return due
to illness, Excom approved the elec
tion by the Union units of an in
terim representative to hold office
until the next campus election.
Excom then disposed of several
financial matters including the un
derwriting of the 1951 Quad for
$1,000, and the raising of the Sun
day Evening Movie manager's sal
ary from $25 to $50 a quarter for
this year only. Distribution of 15
1949 Quads to California high
schools at the discretion of Buttner
and the Athletic Board was ap
proved.

Plans for putting the load of pre-Big Game activities on the
Thanksgiving holidays, November 23 and 24, were presented to
Excom last night by Cardinals President Ted Hinshaw.
Since the Big Game falls on November 25, the only alternative,
Hinshaw said, would be to hold the bonfire and other events on

the Monday, Tuesday, and
day preceding the game. He said I
that if this were done spirit and in- j
terest would drop by game tim?;.
He added that Marchie Schwartz I
feels Thanksgiving Day is the best •
time to hold the rally and that the i
Administration will give all its co- |
operation to events held late in the j
week. With no classes to attend, J
students would have more time to j
build floats and the bonfire on
Thursday and Friday, Hinshaw
