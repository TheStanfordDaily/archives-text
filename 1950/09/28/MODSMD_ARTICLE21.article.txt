# $800 Cleared At Reg Dance
## 
### 
Band members and polo players
were all smiles yesterday after
netting some $800 profit from Tues
day's reg dance at the Pavilion.
'A huge success," pronounced
Polo Association president Bob Mc-
Afee. "I'm sure we could've sold
many more tickets if we'd had the
dancing space."
Actually, the polomen and the
Stanford Band, co-sponsors of the
affair, sold some 650 ducats for
$1 .80 apiece, 30 cents of which went
to the government in taxes. They
marie an additional $100 on refresh
ments.
After expenses of $350 were taken
out, McAfee said, the two organiza
tions found they had cleared $400
apiece.
The Polo Association president
said 450 tickets were sold before
the dance and an additional 250 at
the door.
He indicated that the Polo Asso
ciation would use its profits for ad
ditional equipment and possibly for
repairs to the polo field. The band
is reportedly planning to buy music
folders and other equipment for use
this quarter.
