# Activities' Welcome Mat

Orientation activities for freshmen and other
new students end tonight with a broad intro
dX}cTj'6n to one of the most important phases of
campus lite —activities.
The almost-historical cry for an education of
only readin', writin', and 'rithmetic has long
Since made its exit from the Farm. This genera
tion's studont knows the value of organizing,
planning, and enjoying activities and hobbies
with his lriends and associates.
For many, extra-curricular activities repre
sent not only a leisurely pastime, but also lab
oratory experience more significant than the
best academic instruction.
... 'Hence the Pre Reg Committee has arranged
to provide the newcomer with a broad view of
activities on campus. Although not every club
on campus will be represented by the eight
main speakers, there will be at least one cate
gory publicized which will appeal to every per-
the meeting.
TtTe activities meetings are a change from
the high-pressure signup methods used last
yeai in. U/iion Court. The din of the freshman's
weekend has guieted down to a mere
ioar," arid" he has had time to collect his
thoughts.
Instead of including the introduction to Farm
activities* mi the same day as the all-campus
tours, Fred Firestone, chairman of this phase

of the pre-reg program, decided wisely on the
delayed procedure, which gives the freshmen
a better chance to check the depth before div
ing into a pool of activities too deep for them
to stay afloat.
The administration has gone on record at
different times as favoring student participa
tion in outside interests which allow for the
students' growth in the campus community.
Progress in an activity suited to the individual,
they feel, makes it possible for the young per
son to make a name for himself—and with that,
find himself as an independent adult.
With the addition of a new activities pro
gram for incoming students there seems to be
more hope for a stable activities program for
the entire Stanford family.
Last year Cardinals attempted to establish
an interest file for freshmen. In this manner,
students, whose interests were buried behind
a little shyness or unsociability, could be con
tacted by organizations needing participants in
their respective activities.
This was a start in the right direction.
Firestone pointed out to us recently that
there is no complete activities list to which
students can go to find a group of students with
similar interests.
Subseguently, co-ordination of such a list
and other activities programs seems a desir
able peak toward which we might climb.

able peak toward which we might climb.
Orientation activities for freshmen and other
new students end tonight with a broad intro
dX}cTj'6n to one of the most important phases of
campus lite —activities.
The almost-historical cry for an education of
only readin', writin', and 'rithmetic has long
Since made its exit from the Farm. This genera
tion's studont knows the value of organizing,
planning, and enjoying activities and hobbies
with his lriends and associates.
For many, extra-curricular activities repre
sent not only a leisurely pastime, but also lab
oratory experience more significant than the
best academic instruction.
... 'Hence the Pre Reg Committee has arranged
to provide the newcomer with a broad view of
activities on campus. Although not every club
on campus will be represented by the eight
main speakers, there will be at least one cate
gory publicized which will appeal to every per-
the meeting.
TtTe activities meetings are a change from
the high-pressure signup methods used last
yeai in. U/iion Court. The din of the freshman's
weekend has guieted down to a mere
ioar," arid" he has had time to collect his
thoughts.
Instead of including the introduction to Farm
activities* mi the same day as the all-campus
tours, Fred Firestone, chairman of this phase

of the pre-reg program, decided wisely on the
delayed procedure, which gives the freshmen
a better chance to check the depth before div
ing into a pool of activities too deep for them
to stay afloat.
The administration has gone on record at
different times as favoring student participa
tion in outside interests which allow for the
students' growth in the campus community.
Progress in an activity suited to the individual,
they feel, makes it possible for the young per
son to make a name for himself—and with that,
find himself as an independent adult.
With the addition of a new activities pro
gram for incoming students there seems to be
more hope for a stable activities program for
the entire Stanford family.
Last year Cardinals attempted to establish
an interest file for freshmen. In this manner,
students, whose interests were buried behind
a little shyness or unsociability, could be con
tacted by organizations needing participants in
their respective activities.
This was a start in the right direction.
Firestone pointed out to us recently that
there is no complete activities list to which
students can go to find a group of students with
similar interests.
Subseguently, co-ordination of such a list
and other activities programs seems a desir
able peak toward which we might climb.
