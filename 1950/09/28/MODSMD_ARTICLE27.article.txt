# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
Y^f.tpid.-iv, quite by chance, I made a flying visit to
the Greeky named establishment where I'm supposed
to be living. (I have "the roulette room"—it spins
everytime somebody washes their clothes.) Being in
a kindly mood, I picked up a six-foot paddle and de
cided I would spend a few hours amusing the pledges.
1 hit the usual spots in the house where pledges tra
ditionally congregate—the sleeping porch, the ping
pong table, the card-room. No pledges!
I shudder to tell you where I found the little dev—
fellas. Were Uiey doing something pleasantly worth
while, like good pledges should? (Like planting dyna
mite under the house, or catching fire to the pledge
master). They were not! They were —1 gag on the
word studying!
"Wots this, Blimp-head?," I asked pleasantly rap
ping the first pledge I found across the eye-brows with
my board. Blimp-head happened to be a football
player who was not properly christened Blimphead,
and it was in the Palo Alto Hospital that I learned the
cause of this baek-to-the-books movement. It seems
that the new draft-deferment policy states that the
government will defer any students if they are in the
upper half of their class scholastically.
Now, fellow Americans, I ask you to contemplate
the terror of this plan—which was obviously conceived
by the Communist faction of the State Department.
This contemplation will immediately bring to mind
just what will happen to the much-beleaguered grade
average when all the draft-terrorized frosh and sopho
mores start to crack the books. It brings to mind the
terror of the wartime "on the ball or on the boat"
policy. I think that it will, if carried to an extreme,
have a horrible effect on "the culture and dignity of
Stanford' and all the things that have traditionally
bten ours. For example, Rossotti's will be empty on
Friday afternoons. All of the under-aged males will
have tin own away their false I.D.'s—they'll be home
studying. The Egg will be deserted on week nights.
I'.veiybody will be studying. Rows upon rows of empty
seat:; will fill the theaters. Movie managers will com
mit suicide. The "Junior G-Men" will perform alone
for the Sunday fiicture. The Libe will have to stay

open on Sunday nights, and thousands of students will
perish because they have gulped down an excess of
traditionally terrible Cellar coffee. We will begin to
study as much at Stanford as all of the people who
don't go here think we do.
The thing could work like a chain reaction: The
draftable students would study so much that the aver
age would skyrocket. Thus, in order to stay in school,
the non-draftable ones would have to go into compe
tition with them. Soon the profs would have to start
flunking football players. Then the Big Red would lose
—an unheard-of occurrence —and people would say
nasty things about our coaches, and—worse yet—our
college colors would be dipped in the mud because of
our terrible athletic showing.
The focus of this dash of super-cramming would,
of course, center on the Stanford women, traditional
average raisers. This would have to stop. If they con
tinued to get startlingly good grades, the naturally
more stupid males would fall below the "upper half"
mark and would be dragged off to serve their country.
Thus, many girls because of their eagerness would lose
boy friends and possible dates. In addition, coeds who
got "A's" and "B's" would be shunned not only by the
men but by their girl friends as well—they would be,
by their own intelligence, lowering their much cher
ished ratio.
With the ratio thus lowered, the girls would have
no more reason to come to the farm, and thus the
school would become non-coeducational. The lower
half of the classes would be drafted and with the upper
half—girls—seeking greener pastures, there wouldn't
be anyone left here. The professors, not having been
paid enough to afford a ticket to Berkeley, would prob
ably stay here and starve to death. The Leland Stan
ford Junior Farm would become a ghost town.
We cannot let this happen. Readers, we have
reached a crisis, and we must now act. Each of you, all
of you, must write to your Congressman and tell him
to force the Selective Service headquarters to revoke
this insidious policy before it is too late, before our
beloved Quad becomes deserted and can no more re
sound with the patter of happy ten-minutes-late-to
an-eight-o'clock feet. Act; act now!
