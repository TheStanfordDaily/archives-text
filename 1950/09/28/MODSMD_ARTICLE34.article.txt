# Red Cagers' Hopes High
## 
### 
Head Basketball Coach Everett
Dean held a meeting with more
than 35 potential varsity cagers
yesterday and discussed plans for
the coming season.
With several veterans returning
and some highly touted transfer
talent available, Coach Dean hopes
to develop a contender for the con
ference title, which the Indians last
won in 1942.
Returning regulars will include
big Jim Ramstead, who is expected
to carry much of the scoring and
rebounding load at the pivot, for
wards Jim Walsh and Jack O'Sul
livun, both consistent scorers last :
year, and Bruce Iverson, who start
ed several games at guard.
More than a little interest cen
ters around Ed Tucker, Negro from
Compton College and a Junior Col
lege All-American.
There will be more than the usual
incentive to make the traveling
squad this season, with a barn
storming tour of the East in store
for the Christmas holidays. The
Cards will play five games on the
trip, including one with New York
University in famed Madison
Square Garden.
