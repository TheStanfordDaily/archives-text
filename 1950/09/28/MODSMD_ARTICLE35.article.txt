# Neff New Net Head
## 
### 
If Stanford's varsity tennis team
takes on a winning shine next sea
son, congratulations will be in order
for their new mentor, Jack NefT.
Jack takes over the reins as head
coach of both the varsity and the
freshman squads this year after
serving as assistant to the two
squads for the past two years. At
this early date prospects are par
ticularly good for a championship
net team in 1951. Neff believes that
with the help of three juniors from
the 1949 undefeated freshman
ranks, George Gentry, Ernie du
Bray, and Tom Lewyn, the Indians
may have their most successful ten

nis aggregation since post - war
competition began in 1946. Others
counted upon to aid the netters are
senior Vince Schmieder and two
players up from the freshman
ranks, Bob Sibert and Charlie
Hickox.
Neff graduated from Stanford in
1947. That year also saw him hold
ing down the position of senior
manager. He spent his high school'
days in Southern California attend
ing Santa Ana High, where he was
captain of his school's tennis team.
He spent a year at Snnta Ana Jun
ior College and a semester at UCLA
before entering Stanford.
