Frankie sneered. We'd learned to recognize that sneer, those of us who
have wasted the best years of our life guzzling and bulling in Frankie's El
| Camino drinkery; so we knew that abuse was forthcoming. Also through
i long experience, we realized that this abuse would be directed toward one of
Frankie's two pet hates: (1) Stanford, and (2) sportswriters.
Anyway, as I said, Frankie sneered. We had been discussing Indian Bill
McColl's chances of making All-American this year; and Frankie, who was
' sopping up the remains of a spilled Acme with a rag that was no neophyte
at the game, caught the tail-end of the conversation.
"What d'ya mean, WILL he make All-American? All he's gotta do now
is show up on the field ever' Saturday, even if he crawls, and he can't miss.
Don't kid yerselves, he's already made it."
I breathed easier. It was clear that tonight's dissertation would be di
rected against number (2); and that, therefore, nobody would argue with
; him and a general riot would be averted.
Frankie continued: "If you think All-Americans are made on the field,
you're nuts. They're picked in August by a bunch of bean-brained hacks
who probably won't see their own All-Americans play all season.
"Here's the way it works," Frankie was getting confidential now. "One
of the bean-brains picks Joe Doakes on his pre-season team. A second bean
brain talks about 'All-American candidate Joe Doakes'. Pretty soon 'Joe
I Doakes' and 'All-American' mean the same thing; so all the remaining bean
brains stop watching everybody else.
"Instead, they write things like "Hoopdedoo's sensational halfback Joe
Doakes lived up to his Ail-American notices Saturday when he . . .' "
I had an inspiration. "Eut Frankie, there are only 11 positions. Every
body that's mentioned can't make Ail-American."
"Sure there are only 11 positions. But there are 50 different All-American
teams. All you gotta do is make one of them and your name goes down hi
| sports history. F'rinstance, I'm willing to bet you a shot of Canadian Club
that both Bob Wilkinson and Bill McColl make somebody's team this year.
And I'll throw Ollie Matson in on the deal."
When Frankie mentions Canadian Club, you know he's pretty confident.

Behind times department: A San Francisco sports column devoted the
major part of yesterday's copy to a letter sent in by a Stanford coed, Sue
, Ranley.
I quote from said letter: "We (Stanford) should be ripe for a Rose Bowl
date, not next year, but NOW in '50! With this thought in mind, how about
labeling the victory-bound Indians of 1950 the NOW boys?"
Just in case Miss Ranley's "original" idea catches the public fancy, we of
The Daily sports staff would like to point out that our departed ex-editor,
John Breier of Pipe fame, wrote the following in the October 4, 1949, issue
of The Daily:
"It's no secret that the Indians feels that the time is Now ... I submit the
title 'Now Boys'."
Which proves nothing, except perhaps that very few people read The Daily.
