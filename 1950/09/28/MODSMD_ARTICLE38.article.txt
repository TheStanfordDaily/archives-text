# Indians Better Defense In Mid-Week Scrimmage
## 
### 
Stanford's offensive and defensive
units were featured in a rough, ex
tended midweek scrimmage held
yesterday on the varsity practice
field.
The Indians' defensive eleven
looked much improved over Tues
day in working against a freshman
team, which was running through
USF play patterns.
For the first time this week tackle
Gordy White, who twisted his ankle
in the San Jose game, suited up and
jogged around the practice field.
Eric Southwood, who has been
favoring a bad ankle all week,
slightly pulled a muscle on his oth
er leg and by-passed the rough
work yesterday. However, it was
hoped that Southwood would be
ready for the Dons Saturday.
In addition, third - string center
Don Tobin, a transfer from Menlo
College, had a temperature over
100 degrees and missed practice
yesterday.


GARY KERKORIAN, quarter
back, will be one of the spear
heads of the Card attack when
Stanford meets USF on Saturday.
Kerkorian had spring practice
tutelage from the old master,
Frankie Albert, and is passing
and faking better than ever this
year.
