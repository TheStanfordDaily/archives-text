WASHINGTONâ€”An angry Dem
ocratic political row blazed today
;r James F. Byrnes struck back at
;i charge that he "failed miserably"
a Secretary of State and ran out
when the going got rough.
The charge was attributed to
President Truman in an intimate
biography which presumably had
the President's blessing. The book,
"The Man of Independence," was
wn!ten by Jonathan Daniels, one
time member of the White House
family and close associate of Mr.
Truman in the 1948 election cam
