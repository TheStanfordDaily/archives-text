# Charles Is Champ

### 
NEW YORK. Sept. 27 (UP) â€”
There were no knockdowns but, in
the 14th round of the comparatively
i dull bout, Joe Louis, 3G, was prac
| tically out on his feet as he swayed
i into the ring-ropes after a terrific
| straight right to the head nearly
| floored him.
Louis, with his left eye closed,
blood streaming from his nose and
trickling from his left ear, made one
of the gamest stands of his remark
able career in that session as he
absorbed his younger opponent's
follow-attack, and in the closing
seconds of the rourd he nailed Ez
zard Charles with a hard right to
the chin.
That 14th round was the high
light of the bout, although Louis
threatened to knock out Ezzard in
the 10th when Joe's hooking attack
to the head had the NBA champion
bleeding from his nose and mouth,
and staggering about the ring with
his left eye closed.
Charles, 29, weathered that 10th
round, his only actual danger-spot
| in the fight, and came on to win in
: such impressive fashion that none
of the three ring officials gave Louis
| more than five rounds.
Louis forced the fighting in near
ly every session but his lighter and
shorter Negro opponent foiled him
with comparative ease by his in
and-out tactics. Charles, retreating
steadily, stepped in with left hooks
to the head or straight rights to the
same target; then tied up Louis,
and danced away again.
