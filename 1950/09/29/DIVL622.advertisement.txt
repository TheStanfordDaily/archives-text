Here's the story . . .
Last year we made a lot of very good friends on the campus . . . friends we're seeing now.
In fact these friends gave us such loyal support we wanted to show our appreciation. So
last year we offered a FREE Stanford License Plate insignia to everyone who visited our sta
tion. You'v no doubt seen them on the campus. This year we have more friends so we're
doing it again.
There's no reason to wait, because your plates arc here now. You don't have to buy any
thing at all. It's just our way of saying WELCOME TO THE FARM!

P.S. Our gasoline is guaranteed as the finest sold in Palo Alto, and you buy it for less. And
don't forget, we're a STAR & BAR Station giving away thousands of dollars in FREE Prizes.
And, of course we arc the station running the FOOTBALL contest.
