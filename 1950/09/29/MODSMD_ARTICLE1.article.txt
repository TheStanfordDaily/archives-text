TOKYO, Friday, Sept. 28 (UP)â€”
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur triumph
antly returned to the capital city of
Seoul to President Syngman Rhee of
the Korean Republic today.
Only 24 hours after U.S. Marines
and infantrymen had wiped out the
Communist defenders of Seoul, the
seat of the Korean government was
restored to its 75-year-old president.
The Communists, who abandoned
their defense of Seoul yesterday,
were at Uijongbu to the north of the
capital city and only 18 miles below
the 38th parallel border of Korea.
