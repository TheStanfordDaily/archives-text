# New Card Fight Song Slated for Introduction
## ROLL, YOU BIG RED MACHINE 
### 
Roll, you Big Red Machine,
Get out in front where all your color can be seen,
Blaze a trail of glory for the Cardinal,.
No other team can gather up the steam
(to defeat us)
When you roll to the fray,
Each loyal son of Stanford fighting all the way,
Throw 'em round and round, and pick 'em up and lay 'em
down again,
The Red Machine will roll today.
(Cut this out and bring it to the rally tonight.)
