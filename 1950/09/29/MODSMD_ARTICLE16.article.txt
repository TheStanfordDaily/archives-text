# 'What's the Storey?'
## Unmentionables Tell Tale 
### 
Storey House langerie waved gaily across the Row last night,
unsung, unfilled and unclaimed.
It was a stroke of retaliation by first-year girls who had spent
about an hour trying to track down a fraternity dessert that the
old members had arranged for them.
About 5 p.m. a note appeared on the blackboard that all new

girls, under penalty of fine, must
attend a dessert at the Phi Kappa
Psi house. "Dress up a bit," the
note said, "wool dresses, hose, and
heels."
Gulping down the main course,
some 20 "new girls" were then
loaded into the get-away cars. Old
member drivers explained that the
Phi Psi driveway was very difficult
to turn in, and the unsuspecting
group was left alone.
They were greeted by these
words, "If you are Cubberley girls
you're early. We invited you for
eight." But rising to the occasion,

the fraternity brothers offered the
wayward wanderers a ride to the
Phi Kap house. Anybody could
make a mistake like that.
But Storey got the same story at
1 the Phi Kap house and the Phi Sig
! house.
Undaunted, the victims returned
I home and staged a lingerie raid,
| which, with the assistance of "gag-
I sters" and to the delight of male
[ neighbors, was hung across the
I Row.
That's the Storey story.
