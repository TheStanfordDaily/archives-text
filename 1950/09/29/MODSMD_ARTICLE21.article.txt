# Stern Men Hear Coach
## 
### 
Stern Hall's first meeting of the
quarter last night was highlighted
by a short talk from Head Football
Coach Marchie Schwartz.
Schwartz discussed the Indian
team position by position and said
that he expected tomorrow's USF
game to be a dog-fightâ€”a toss-up
that could go cither way for Stan
ford.
"That 01 lie Matson has the poise
of a jungle panther. He's a foot
ball team by himself, and they have
other good boys," Schwartz said.
Ted Hinshaw, Stern president,
introduced Schwartz and presented
publicity director Fred Glover,
writer Don Warton of Look maga
zine, and Stern director Patricia
"Miss Pat" Davidson.
First event on Social Chairman
Gene Fortine's calendar is a coffee
hour for Stern men and their dates
following this week's Sunday Eve
ning Movies.
