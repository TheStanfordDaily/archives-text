### 
Students wanting tickets for the
USF. Santa Clara, UCLA, and
Washington football games may still
get them today at the Pavilion tick
et office from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Student tickets for the USF,
Santa Clara, and Washington games
are free, but the UCLA ducat for
the game at Los Angeles Oct. 21
costs $1.50.
Don Liebendorfer, publicity di
rector, announced yesterday that
tickets to all football games will be
required of children of all ages who
wish to sit in the side sections with
their parents.
Children under 12 may gain free
admission to the games, said Lie
bendorfer, if they go in Gate A and
sit in the special section. If they
wish to sit with parents or friends
in the end zones, there is a 50-cent
charge.
The publicity director made the
announcement to clarify the mis
understanding which many people
had last Saturday. Even babes in
arms, he emphasized, must have
full-price tickets if they are to be
taken into the side sections.
