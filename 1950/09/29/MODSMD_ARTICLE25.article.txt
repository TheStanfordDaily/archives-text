# Card Machine To Face USF
## Matson Leads Underdog Invaders; Expect 35,000 in Stanford Stadium 
### DWIGHT WILBUR Daily Sports Editor 
(JSF's unpredictable Dons, with Ail-American candidate Ollik
Matson leading the attack, will invade Stanford Stadium tomorrow
lor a 2:30 battle with Stanford's air-minded gridders.
The Dons, who have failed in seven attempts to beat Stanford
on the gridiron, are rated 7-point underdogs in tomorrow's battle

of the undefeated. A crowd of more
than 35,000 persons will be on hand
for the expected high-scoring contest.
Coach Marchie Schwartz of the In
dians announced last night that there
would be only one change in Stan
ford's opening lineup tomorrow.
Right guard Owen Powell, a 11) 1 -
pound junior, up from the jayvee:;,
will get the starting call in place of
Jess Cone. Cone will operate on the
Indians' defensive unit.
Doubtful Dons
Three USF stars, quarterback Ed
Brown, halfback Roy Barni, and end
Merrill Peacock, v/ho saw little or no
action against Tulsa last Saturday,
were put on the doubtful starting list
by Coach Joe Kuharich, starting hi:;
this season as head coach of the Dons.
Of the three, Barm, a hard-driving
runner, has the best chance to be
ready for tomorrow's contest.
In addition to Matson, who run:-,
from the fullback position, USF ha,
two up-and-coming backs, left half
Joe Scudcro and right, half George
Carley, who will see plenty of action.
Scudero, a newcomer to the Don
backfield, averaged 4.(5 yards a try
against Tulsa last Saturday and also
scored one of the three USF touch
downs.
Carley, a fast-stepping junior, av
eraged 8.0 yards in nine tries in the
Tulsa rout.
Ililltopper QB's
If first-string Don quarterback Ed
Brown is unable to start, Gene
Sweeters, a three-year letterman,
will again lead USF's high-geared
T-formation.
Sweeters, who is very deceptive in
operating a ground attack, completed
4 out of 16 pass attempts last week.
However, the Don QB will probably
be in there pitching tomorrow, since
the Indians arc weak in pass defense.
On the Card side of the ledger,
tackle Gordy White and halfback
Eric Southwood are scheduler! for
limited action only. Both White and
Southwood are recovering from
ankle injuries.
Card Vets Start
Stanford will start the same back
field that opened against San Josr
State last weekend—Gary Kerkorian
at quarterback, Boyd Benson at left,
half, Bob White at right half, and
Bob Griffin at full.
Left half Harry Hugasian, who
stood out on defense as well as of
fense last Saturday, seems to be com
pletely recovered from a pre-season -
scrimmage ankle injury and will be
ready to play at top form tomorrow,
Stanford backs Dick Horn, Chuck
Essegian, Wes Laubscher. and Bob
Bryan are also scheduled for a great
deal of offensive action against the
Hilltoppers.
History of Rivalry
In their last meeting in 1946. Stan •
ford, a 3 to 1 underdog, crushed an
overconfident Don team, 33 to 7. Pre
vious to this, in 1910, another Don
eleven, also a heavy favorite, was un
fortunate enough to run into Stan
ford's 1940 Rose Bowl team, and was
easily subdued. 27 to 0.
Stanford's new backfield coach,
Pete Kmetovic, All-Coast halfback
on the 1940 team, perhaps will have
more knowledge of tomorrow's con
