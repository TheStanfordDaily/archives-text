# 'No Social Contact'
## 
### 
More than 30 year 3 ago, Stanford University
started something that has since become one of
il most honored traditions.
That something was a system known as "de
ferred rushing" and few colleges even today
can boast a similar tradition.
Deferred rushing 30 years ago mean for the
first time in the Farm's long history that first
quarter freshmen did not step off trains and
buses into the waiting arms of fraternity men
many of them commissioned to high-pressure
"hot prospects" within fraternity walls.
It meant for the first time that frosh were
given a chance to get acquainted with Stanford
and develop a real class spirit without being
split up immediately into the smaller fraternity
groups.
Today, deferred rushing is in essence what
it was 30 years ago. Freshmen are not rushed
until their second quarter here. Moreover, they
live for one full year in Encina—buildinq up a
spirit all their ov/n.
Today, deferred rushing has received the full
backing of the Farm's 24 fraternities. This year,
under the leadership of Interfraternitv Council
President Dave Larimer, the Grecians are re
doubling efforts to preserve the "no social con
tact" rule which lies at the very core of deferred
rushing.

"No social contact" means exactly what it
says. No fraternity men are allowed upstairs
in Encina, and none may approach the frosh
either in the Village or at Toyon, where they
are also quartered. The Greeks must refrain
from inviting freshmen to fraternity parties and
may not arrange double dates with them. In
short, any social contact with freshmen must
be taboo until official rushing begins early next
quarter.
And the same goes for the first year men. No
parties, no visits to fraternity houses, no double
dates.
After 30 years, deferred rushing and no so
cial contact have proven themselves beneficial
both to the frosh, the fraternities, and the Uni
versity. Opponents of the two systems have
rarely been able to find fault with their under
lying philosophies.
We heartily endorse Stanford's unique and
well-balanced rushing setup. However, we feel
we should remind both parties concerned—the
fraternities and the freshmen—that the system
will continue to be "an honored tradition" only
if the rules are adhered to.
Social contact would make a farce of deferred
rushing. NO social contact transforms deferred
rushing into a tradition of which Stanford can
be justly proud. —R.R.

backing of the Farm's 24 fraternities. This year,
under the leadership of Interfraternitv Council
President Dave Larimer, the Grecians are re
doubling efforts to preserve the "no social con
tact" rule which lies at the very core of deferred
rushing.

"No social contact" means exactly what it
says. No fraternity men are allowed upstairs
in Encina, and none may approach the frosh
either in the Village or at Toyon, where they
are also quartered. The Greeks must refrain
from inviting freshmen to fraternity parties and
may not arrange double dates with them. In
short, any social contact with freshmen must
be taboo until official rushing begins early next
quarter.
And the same goes for the first year men. No
parties, no visits to fraternity houses, no double
dates.
After 30 years, deferred rushing and no so
cial contact have proven themselves beneficial
both to the frosh, the fraternities, and the Uni
versity. Opponents of the two systems have
rarely been able to find fault with their under
lying philosophies.
We heartily endorse Stanford's unique and
well-balanced rushing setup. However, we feel
we should remind both parties concerned—the
fraternities and the freshmen—that the system
will continue to be "an honored tradition" only
if the rules are adhered to.
Social contact would make a farce of deferred
rushing. NO social contact transforms deferred
rushing into a tradition of which Stanford can
be justly proud. —R.R.
