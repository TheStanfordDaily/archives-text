FLUSHING, N.Y. — The United
Nations Security Council tonight de
feated a move to extend an invita
tion to the Chinese Communists to
come here Nov. 15 to join debate on
their charges that the U.S. committed
"aggression" in sending its Seventh
Fleet to guard Formosa.
The move missed out by only one
vote, but the issue will come up again
tomorrow morning because Yugo
slavia wants to change its mind and
provide the needed seventh vote.
However, the Chinese Nationalists
have threatened a double veto to
block any invitation to Peiping, and
the upshot apparently will be the
same.
