# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
Did you listen the fight Wednesday night? Sitting
there by the radio, listening to the roar of the crowd
and the tense, stacatto report of the announcer, I felt
My: < If whisked backward through time by the Mer
( ury of memory to a night years ago . . . the night of
my last light.
Once again I was climbing through the ropes . . .
the killer instinct filling my eyes with hate . the
blood roar of the crowd filling my heart with the lust
for battle . . . my seconds filling my gloves with lead
. . . ready to fight for the greatest crown in boxing.
Yes, I was a boxer once, before I found out that I
could hit a typewriter and not have it hit back. "Giz
zard' Palmieri, I was known as—they called me "Giz
zard because I was like a beast in the ring (they
nevea told me the only beast with a gizzard was a
chicken;. And I remember warming up in the dress
in'.' room before the fight . . . shooting salt tablets at
the coach with my improved slingshot. "Gizzard," he
said, "how do you feel?" . . . "With my hands," I
shot back gayly.
He patted my head fondly and I was up at the count
of nino. "You're not scared?" he asked. "Are you ac
cusing Gizzard Palmieri of having cold feet!" I cried,
gingerly clasping my frostbitten toes.
The came a knock at the door. The moment had
come! I ran but I couldn't lock the door to the rest
room, and when 1 came to they were leading me down
the aisle
The crowd cheered wildly! The brothers waved as
I went by. Eevery cent in the house was bet on this
light, and I heard them shouting encouragement. . . .

"You last past the first round, Gizzard, and we'll bash
your head in!"
My spirits soared . . . what pals! Suddenly a figure
darted from the crowd . . . my darling! She threw
her arms around me . . . "Remember," she whispered
"the car is mine if you don't come back." "One last
kiss," I cried. "Shove off," she said, "you're sweaty."
Then they were hoisting me over the hopes (they
let me climb through once and 1 got hung up so bad
they had to cut me out). And as I sat in the bright
glare of the hot lights, gazing out at the vast clamor
ing cavern I thought grimly of the long string of sav
age battles I had survived to reach the finals of this
tournament—four byes and a TKO (one of the broth
ers reached in and pulled the guy's stool out from
under hirn—it was the only fight ever called on account
of a broken pelvis).
But now the-referee was calling us to the center of
the ring for instructions. I felt mean. I scowled at my
opponent. He looked mean, too. I started crying.
Then we were back in our corners waiting for the
beii. (He was waiting for the bell ... I was tearing
around the ring searching for a gate).
Then suddenly the bell rang, and I saw him rush at
me . . . and then something started ringing again . . .
strange, it felt like my head, but it must have been a
bell ... it sounded so hollow.
They'll tell you he hit me, but it isn't true . . .
really. I'm sure something else happened to me . . .
a diesel locomotive possibly. But I don't mind any
more, 'cause now I hear bells all the time, and it's
really very pleasant, once you get use to it . . . hear?
. . . listen. . . ding . . . dong . . . ding . . . dong
