# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Working Hypothesis' 
### 
To (he Editor:
The world is in a heck of mess, nobody needs to be
told that. You don't even have to read the newspapers.
It can hit you hard and sudden, like a telegram to
"next of kin," or it can pass by on the periphery of
your life, like finding out how migratory workers live,
over in the valley.
Oi it may be something you scarcely notice, like
the faces and manner of the middle-aged people sit
ing iii public parks day after day because they have
nothing else to do. (They are the dis-employed.) Go
down to the divorce courts, or take a walk through
lums (even Palo Aito has its share) —watch the Negro
i>. he applies foi a job, or tries to buy a meal in the
wi om; kind (for him) of restaurant.
V/< 11, Stanford students, what's your reaction to
thi"? Are you looking for a catalytic idea, a magic
theory^ 1 flavo you found an answer that answers, and
'I'>» nt ju..t ignore?
Now I'M tell you something you knew all along: I
Hon t have the answer either. But I have an approach;
may J call it a "working hypothesis?" I'll tell you
what if is, il you'll promise not to get mad.

I belong to the Democratic Party, and to a small
group of people (mostly students) who work on be
half of Democratic candidates; in plain words, we do
precinct work. Isn't that incredible? (Here's a guy
who actually thinks that' Truman and Mrs. Douglas
mean what tht*y : ay! I wonder how much he gets paid
for this.)
II you've read down this far, and don't think this is
all in very bad taste, you must be a Democrat too, and
further talk is unnecessary. I just add enough to say
that we are having an informal gathering on Wednes
day, Get. 4, in the back room of Dinah's Shack.
We like to think there's room for everybody—World
Federalists, Laborites, Free Enterprisers, and even
(don't tell the Republicans) Socialists. If you come
and work with us, you'll find lots you don't like, and
the longer you stay, the more you'll find.
But politics is that way: you use the instrument (it
really isn't too bad) because it's the only one that is
capable of doing the job; and if you, Mr. Header, have
a few hours to work a precinct between now and
Nov. 7, you can help to guarantee that the job is done.
