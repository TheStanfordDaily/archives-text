# Daily Machine Cuts On-the-Spot Photos
## 
### 
The Stanford Dnily can now bring its readers last
minute news photos in almost the same time it takes to
write and set in type a late news story.
This last-minute coverage is possible through the use
of the Fairchild photo-electric engraver (pictured at
left), a new step in the engraving of pictures for news
paper use.
The Fairchild is rented by the Daily from the Fair
child Camera and Instrument Corporation of Jamaica,
N.Y. It looks like a lathe, and is operated by an electric
eye which transmits impulses to an electric stylus. The
stylus cuts a piece of plastic on a revolving cylinder,
synchronized with the picture on another cylinder,
making an engraving.
The entire process of making today's football cartoon
took less than 20 minutes. Yesterday's engraving of Dr.
Wallace Sterling's reception for freshmen was finished
exactly two hours after it was taken. These are ex
amples of the speed with which the Daily can now get
its pictures into print.
