# Lagunita to Be Transformed Into Fair Ground Saturday
## 
### 
Farm roughs and gals can do
their bit for overseas relief while
taking part in the first all-campus
social event of the quarter at the
Lagunita "Farm Fair." Lagunita
doors will be open to the campus
Saturday from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. to
welcome all students new arid old
to the social side of the "Farm."
Lagunita girls will host the cam
pus as roughs and gals gather to
dance to the music of Bobby An
derson's combo while making new
friends and renewing old acquaint
ances.
Carrying out the "Fair" theme,
with funds going to the Lag relief
drive, Lag girls will be vending
hand - knit argyles, home - made
cookies, travel posters, balloons,
cotton candy, and other good things
to eat. For the adventuresome stu
dents there will be a white-ele
phant sale and an auction.
John Yarborough of the Village
personnel office will act as auction
eer for such valuable items as

giant-sized whiskey bottles (emp
ty), reincarnated bicycles, and au
tographed footballs.
The fair-time atmosphere will be
in fall swing at Lagunita come Sat
urday night, with informal dress in
order for the occasion. Admission
will be free.
Plans for the Fair got under way
last spring with Alberta Engvall,
general chairman; Shirley Gabbert,
arrangements; Marian Christopher
son, publicity; and Arvis Meyer,
hostesses, making the necessary
preparations.
If you see a few Farm gals wan
dering around the campus in over
alls today, do not fear an invasion;
it is only a few Laguntia girls get
ting into the spirit for the occasion.
