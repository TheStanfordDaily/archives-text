# Campaign Study Begins
## 
### 
The Stanford University Institute of the study are announced some

for Journalistic Studies began this
week to make a content analysis of
the news in a sample of 12 Califor
nia daily and Sunday newspapers
that relates to the Nixon-Douglas
senatorial campaign.
The study is being financed by a
research grant from the American
Newspaper Guild and its locals in
California.
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, director of
the institute, said that one of the
purposes of the study is to deter
mine to what degree, if any, the po
litical bias of the newspaper is re
themes used by both parties during
a tense campaign. Another purpose
is to explore the propaganda
themes used by both arties during
a time of crisis, such as the Korean
war.
During the primary campaign,
Mrs. Douglas charged that a news
blackout existed for her side of the
campaign due to the predominantly
pro-Nixon attitude of the state's
newspapers.
The sample is representative of
Republican, Democratic, and inde
pendent newspapers located in
large and small cities in various
parts of the state and represents 43
per cent of the daily and 63 per cent
of the Sunday circulation in the
state. The papers selected will not
be identified publicly until results

time after the November election.
The procedure involves the
counting of all of the "symbols"
used, the symbols being classified as
favorable, unfavorable, balanced, or
neutral with respect to the politi
cal parties and candidates.
This method of content analysis,
which was developed by Dr. Harold
D. Lasswell at the Library of Con
gress, has been used to measure the
amount and direction of Communist
and pro-Hitler propaganda and in
various other ways to test bias of
radio, newspapers, and magazines.
When carefully administered, it
obtains a precise measure instead of
the impressionistic measures ob
tained by former methods.
