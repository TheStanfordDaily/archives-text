# Backfield Coach Speaks With Authority on USF
## 
### 
Unless you've just blown in from
the Arctic wastelands, you know
that the University of San Fran
cisco plays Stanford tomorrow.
The man best qualified to tell the
comparative merits of these two
teams is Pete Kmetovic, new back
field coach for the Cards. Kmeto
vic is "new" in that this is his first
term as Stanford backfield coach;
but last year he held a similar po
sition with, yep —you guessed it—
USF.
Calls Matson Best
Kmetovic, who saw the Dons pul
verize a good Tulsa team last Sat
urday night, says, "USF is 50 per
cent better this year than they
were last. Ollie Matson is im
proved, and can go the whole way
at any time. In my opinoin, he will
be the best back on the field.
"The game ought to he very
close. I think, though, that we
have the edge in halfbacks and
passing, especially if Ed Brown
isn't able to go. They can't match
our topflight receivers. Stanford's
offensive line is better than
USF's, hut the defensive lines are
about equal; our second - string
defense, however, was coming
close to our first string today."
Kmetovic, although being a new
man on the block, is certainly not
foreign to Stanford football. In 1940
he was one-fourth of the most fa
bled backfield in Indian history—
Frankie Albert, Hugh Gallerneau,

Kmetovic, and Norm Standlee. That
season the Cards went to the Rose
Bowl and polished off Nebraska 21
to 13, thanks to Kmetovic.
the Injuns had been held on the
Nebraska one-yard line, the Corn
huskers kicked to the 45 where he
accepted the ball and raced all the
way to the goal.
Kmetovic was named All-Coast
halfback and grabbed several All-
America honors.
