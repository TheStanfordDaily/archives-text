# Week's Top Games Will Be Tabbed
## 
### 
The war is on! It's the Daily
sport scribes against the faculty.
Every Friday until the end of the
1950 football season, three faculty
"experts" will try to out-predict
three Daily prognosticators as to
the outcome of 15 of the nation's
top football contests.
The faculty swamis are Richard
L. Balch, chief men's counselor and
former football coach at Union Col
lege; Mai Elward, end coach and
scout for the Stanford football
team; and Alfred Grommon, pro
fessor of education and English,
former director of admissions, and
Stanford grid statistician.
Pitted against the awesome fac
ulty trio are three Daily sharp
shootersâ€”Bob Bernstein, A 1 Berry,
and Dwight Wilbur.
The Dippy aces are wiping the
dust off their crystal ball (a techni
color one) while the more vener
able facultymen are preparing to
throw the weight of their Masters'
and Doctors' degrees against the
youngish sport scribes.
