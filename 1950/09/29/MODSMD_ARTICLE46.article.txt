## CHAMPION DIVER Harlan New Diving Coach 
### 
Swimming Coach Tom Haynie
announced yesterday that his as
sistant coach in charge of diving
this year would be Bruce Harlan.
Harlan, who was gradutaed from
Ohio State University last year, can
be compared with Dr. Sammy Lee
as the greatest diver in the world.
He won six NCAA diving cham
pionships in three years of compe
tition for Mike Peppe at Columbus.
In the 1948 Olympics, he won the
one-meter springboard diving, the
three - meter springboard diving,
and placed second in the 10-meter
platform diving.
Haynie hopes that this will clear
up Stanford's biggest weakness in
swimming, that is, diving. For in
stance, USC took one-two-three in
the PCC diving last year.
Harlan's pupils this year will be
Bill Glathe and John Miller, a jun
ior and a soph respectively. Gluthe
is present Senior Men's Pacific As
sociation three - meter springboard
diving champ. High School Ail-
American at Palo Alto, Glathe is
best on the tower. Last July .at the
Far Western AAU meet in San
Francisco, he took sixth to the five
best tower divers in the country,
trailing the fifth-place man by six
points.
Miller, last year's freshman diver,
took seconds in the CIF light
weights and varsity diving while
attending San Bernardino High.
