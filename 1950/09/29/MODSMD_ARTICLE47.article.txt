# "DIGGER" O'DELL
## Coffin Corner 
### 
The last time I turned this column loose, I received so much response that
I haven t written one since. But I can't hold back any longer—l have some
morbid comments, as the column title suggests, that I'm sure no one will
want to read—so, here goes.
MORBID COMMENT No. I—What's going to happen to the "Now Boys"
if Gordy White gets laid out kinda' permanent-like next time? Or what
will happen if Kerkorian or McColl comes up with rheumatism?
It looks as if the Post and Collier's and Bill Stern and the rest haven't
considered these possibilities. Everyone has admitted readily that we're
not exactly overcrowded on the field, but up to now, nobody, including the
players themselves, have dared to think of who would go against the likes
01, say, Demirjian, Carmichael, and McMurtry, or Monachino, Olszewski,
and Schabarum if some of the boys were to turn up for practice with a
sprained eyelash or something. I'll bet Marchie won't even look himself in
the eye when he shaves for fear of that thought popping up.
The point is this—before we let everyone decide we're going somewhere
this year, maybe we should find out who's going to take us if our big guns
stub their toes on the rocky road. After all, big guns can be knocked off
as easily as bean shooters.
MORBID COMMENT No. 2—Every time you mention Army around here
these days, people think of two things—the Football Team and Korea. 1
can never find out which is more to be feared because I'm immediately
trampled in the rush to find the nearest bomb shelter. Now that the hoys
have paid their tuition, they can breathe easier for a little while and think
of footballs instead of foxholes. Incidentally, if the University officials
had had any foresight they would have doubled the tuition last year and
they would still have had a record turnout. (Aw. who likes girls, any
way!)
But to get back to Army, and now I'm speaking of Kaydets and not Ig
nitions, people quake and quiver at the very thought of the day Army comes
west to do a little Farming. Then, if the person is the calm type, he'll start
ranting and raging about the stupidity of the BAC boys for setting us up a
week before Cal, entirely forgetting about contracts and finding open dates
at the same time. Of course, it's not that we're afraid to play them, but,
coming just before the Big Game, well, it's like 1 pointed out earlier, Army's
so big and we're so breakable.
HOWEVER, (and now I'm really getting morbid) has it ever occurred to
anyone what chances A rrn y is taking? Just think—they're playing us two
weeks before tjie Navy game. Don't laugh; it could happen.
If memory serves correct, Army didn't exactly come out of our last game
in '47 in one piece, score or no score. They're taking just as big a chance as
we are. Who knows, they may be the ones to come out battered, and I still
say score or no score.
I don't know what you're going to do, but I'm going out and stock up on
coffins. Somebody is going to need my blessings.
