# KZSU Broadcasts To Start on Sunday
## 
### 
KZSU, the campus radio station, recently crowned "The Voice
of Stanford," will broadcast for the first time this quarter on Sun
day night.
Anyone interested in joining the station staff or visiting KZSU
will find the studios on the second floor in the rear of Memorial

Hall. The offices are downstairs and
the telephone number is DA 2-2971.
Open house will be held on Monday
evening, Oct. 2, beginning at 7 p.m.
The campus station (880 kilocycles)
is owned by the University and is
operated by students from its studios
in Memorial Hall. This year KZSU
is in it fourth year of broadcasting
and is looking for new workers.
Opportunities are available in the
production, music, engineering, an
nouncing, and office departments.
During this quarter the station will
be supervised by its faculty adviser,
Dr. Skipwith Athey.
The station will broadcast six
nights a week, daily except Saturday,
from 7 to 11 p.m. Special events
broadcasts will be scheduled when
ever the situation warrants it.
Last year the station received
much acclaim for its complete cov
erage of broadcasts of campus elec
tions, baseball and basketball games,
the Spring Sing, and the Bach B
Minor Mass from Memorial Church.
KZSU is expanding its facilities to
bring listeners more complete cov
erage, both in the fields of engineer
ing and production. A number of
new departments have been added
to the office organization and
throughout the summer its engineers
have been busy improving reception
throughout the campus — at Stern

Hall and Stanford Village, in par
ticular.
