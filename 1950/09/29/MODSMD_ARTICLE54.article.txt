# Commuters' File To Be Sent Out
## 
### 
All commuters who signed the
Alpha Phi Omega commuters' file on
reg day will receive copies of the en
tire file within the next few days.
Bill Gullikson, president of the na
tional service fraternity, said that
commuters themselves, after receiv
ing the list, should contact others in
their immediate area for rides. The
service fraternity, he pointed out,
compiles the list and mails it out, but
does not arrange the rides.
The permanent file will be kept in
the ASSU office. Additional com
muters may submit their names and
get information concerning other off
campus students there. No additional
lists wil! be mailed.
