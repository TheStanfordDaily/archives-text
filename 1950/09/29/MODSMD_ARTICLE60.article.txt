good enough reason for switching to
the line, and was a first-stringer at
the guard slot last year.
Once again, the Don replacements
at this position will have to come
from the sophomore ranks. Bill Pol
man and John Calkins, both l ight at
200 pounds, were the regulars with
the '49 frosh; but the 245-pound heft
of a lad named Gene DeMartini could
also .spell trouble for the Marehie
men.
( ENTERS—BurI Toler, whose last
week's performance against Tulsa
scooted his name into the rapidly
growing "potential All-American"
ranks, is the standout here. Toler is
big, last, and coordinated, and what
more can you say? He's especially
effective as a line-backer.
And Toler has at least one potent
replacement in the person of Art
Alois, a letterman from two years
ago who missed the entire '49 season
wiien he suffered an early-practice
ankle break. Art's specialty is down
field blocking, so he'll see plenty of
; offensive action while Toler will
carry the bulk of the defensive load.
QUARTERBACKS- -Two veterans
will handle the master-minding du
ties. Gene Sweeters, in his fourth
season of varsity work, got the call
last week. But Ed Brown, one of the
j most versatile backs on the Coast,
will press hard for the opening
beckon if he's fully recovered from
j last Saturday's injury.
Operating from a halfback slot in
j '49, Brown passed for an average of
; 23.5 yards per toss, was the fourth

Cards' offensive punch that after
noon.
The year 1934 saw the roughest,
toughest game to date, with the
Cards coming out on top of a 3 to
0 win, thanks to the toe of the afore
mentioned Moscrip, who kicked the
winning goal late in the game after
long drives engineered by Grayson,
Hamilton, and Alustiza had failed
to cross the last chalk stripe.
The succeeding year marked the
last appearance of the Vow Boys
and after three years of play they
had reached their peak. The Indians
rolled up an unimpressive, listless
10 to 0 win over the Dons.

the Don scoring with f>(i points. He is
also a top-notch blocker. In short,'
no slouch, this lad.
HALFBACKS Hoy 13;•.i ni and
Vince Sakowski, both lettermen who
averaged 4.1 and (1.2 yards respec
tively each time they carried the
hoghide last yea)', will probably open.
But look out for a little speedster
named Joe Scudero, a former All-
City bull-tutor with Mission High
who shared the limelight with the
fabulous Matson in USF's opener.
Scudero is a soph, 5 feet !0 inches in
height, weighs i<3s pounds, and runs
like the very devil.
FULLBACKS No bona tide sports
fan should need any briefing at this
position. Ollie Mat on is the lad the
Hilltoppt-rs are counting on to bring
home the long-awaited Stanford
scalp.
Offensively, Matson possesses a
devastating combination blistering
speed which has brought him world
wide fame in track circles, and nearly
200 pounds of dynamiting power.
Defensively, his speed and (5 foot 2
inch height will probably be called
on to halt the touchdown tendencies
of sticky-lingered Bill McColl.
When Ollie needs a rest. Roy
Giorgi. who is as heavy but not so
fast or tall as Matson. will spell the
Don Star.
That's the lineup. Add it together
and it could total to a .serious threat

Once again, the Don replacements
at this position will have to come
from the sophomore ranks. Bill Pol

And Toler has at least one potent
replacement in the person of Art
Alois, a letterman from two years

QUARTERBACKS- -Two veterans

HALFBACKS Hoy 13;•.i ni and

But look out for a little speedster
named Joe Scudero, a former All-
City bull-tutor with Mission High
who shared the limelight with the
fabulous Matson in USF's opener.
Scudero is a soph, 5 feet !0 inches in
height, weighs i<3s pounds, and runs

FULLBACKS No bona tide sports
fan should need any briefing at this

Hilltoppt-rs are counting on to bring

scalp.
Offensively, Matson possesses a
devastating combination blistering
speed which has brought him world
wide fame in track circles, and nearly
200 pounds of dynamiting power.
Defensively, his speed and (5 foot 2

on to halt the touchdown tendencies
of sticky-lingered Bill McColl.
When Ollie needs a rest. Roy
