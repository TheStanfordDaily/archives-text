## 
### LARRY CAHN 
The spirited rivalry between USF
anil Stanford flares up anew this
Saturday when the Dons meet the
Indians for the eighth time in 18
years. The Cards presently hold a
clean slate of seven wins in as
many games from the City visitors.
The most notable example is 1940.
A Stanford team, with one win to
its credit in 1939, met a "loaded"
Hilltop eleven at Kezar Stadium in
the season opener. The Indians, un
der a new coach, Clark Shaugh

nessy, brought a new type of foot
ball to the Coast —the T formation.
Not only did Stanford sweep
through USF, 21-0. but the upstart
Wow Boys pulled a complete re
hearsal reversal and ended the sea
son undefeated, much to the sur
prise of football filberts.
Once more in 1946 USF was
called on in the second game of the
season to test the Cards, a team
which had on'y the week before
mashed Idaho 45 to 0.
The Dons and 150 - pound scat

back Forrest Hall were even odds
favorites to take the Injins into
camp, but the Lloyd Merriman-led
locals were more than a match and
went ahead to roll up a 33 to 7 win.
The Indians opened the 1941 sea
son with all indications pointing to
a '40 repeat. Then they ran into
Oregon State and got dropped 10
to 0. USF was one of the later
games on the schedule and the Sta
dium saw one of the wildest of
fensive scoring duels in its history
as the Indians ran up over 500 yards

while amassing 25 first downs in
the 42 to 2(3 win.
Going back to the beginning of
the series in 1932, Stanford won the
inaugural '20 to 7. making the most
out of a good line and a fair crop
of backs.

From 1933 to 1935 the Dons had
the same difficulty with the Indians
that ail opposing teams did. The
'33 squad, the first of the Vowing
Sophomores, under Tiny Thornhill

Francisco and downed a fighting
