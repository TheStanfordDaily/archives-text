# Road Construction Ends This Week
## 
### 
Campus road construction will be
finished up this week with the final
paving of the Escondido-Argucllo
intersection by Stern Hall. Escon
dido, in front of Stern, and Galvcz,
from Stern to Encina, were opened
up to traffic Thursday as the seal
coat was completed a day ahead of
schedule.
The Escondido-Arguello intersec
tion received an oil coat during the
weekend to permit traffic to go
through. It will be closed to cars
while the seal coat is being applied.
The reconstruction work includes
curbs and gutters and more parking
space around the dormitories.
