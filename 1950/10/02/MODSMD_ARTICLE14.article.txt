## Bruins Will Fete Cards At Westwood 
### 
The Indian tribe from Stanford
has been invited to help cele
brate the UCLA Homecoming on
a long weekend lasting from Fri
day, Oct. 20 to Oct. 22. The invi
tation and an outline of the plans
for the festivities in Bruinville
were outlined at a meeting of
campus leaders Friday after
noon, by UCLA homecoming
marshal Jim Davis and a group
of assistants.
Heading the list of Stanford stu
dents urged to be on the Wcstwood
campus by Friday morning are the
96-piece Stanford Band, the five
cheer leaders, and student body of
ficers.
A vigorous program of activities
centering around the theme "Fron
tier Town Jamboree," were de
scribed by Davis and the other
Uclans who made the special trip
to the Stanford campus.
All floats, house decorations, and
rallies will be characterized by the
slogan "Frontier Bruin Brings In
jun Ruin," Davis said.
As the band did two years ago, it
will appear at 11 a.m. Friday of the
big weekend at the official corona
tion of the UCLA Homecoming
Queen. Also on the program will be
Head Yell Leader Pete "Red Dog"
Henderson and his four cohorts.
Activities of interest to the rest
of the Stanford aggregation mak
ing the trip early will be a float
parade through Wcstwood Village
followed by a prc-game rally, a
bonfire, and the rally barn dance.
ASSU members will be admitted
to the dance by showing their stu
dent body cards at the door, the
Bruin homecoming marshal said.
The parade, which is expected to
attract a crowd of 175,000 people
from the two campuses and from the
Westwood Village area, will start at
8 p.m. and is scheduled to take about
one and three-fourths hours.
The line of march will be drawn
up near the former Sonja Hcnie
Ice Palace. Included in the parade
will he the Stanford Band and
ASSU president and vice-presi
dent, Ted Buttncr and Jo Lyons,
who will ride in an open converti
ble.
A special section will be reserved
in the small bleacher section for a
restricted number of ASSU officers
taking part in the weekend cele
bration.
The UCLA aggregation said a 35-
foot-high bonfire would follow the
parade in front of the reviewing
stand. Blue and gold spotlights from
MGM studios will set the scene for
the pre-game rally, to which mem
bers of both student bodies are wel
come.
At the dance, which follows the
rally, in the women's gym on the
UCLA campus, Danny Kaye and a
name orchestra, yet to be announced,
will provide entertainment for the
students.
The band, represented by Manager
Jack Blumberg, at the Friday meet
ing, was expected to fly to Los An
geles Airport. UCLA has offered to
transport the musicians from there to
Westwood.
Both Friday meals will be pro
vided for the Farm bandsmen,
UCLA's Davis promised, as well as
housing for those men not living
in the immediate Los Angeles vi
cinity.
Arrangements for pre-game activi
ties by both bands, the winning
floats from the parade, and a posse
of Indian maidens on horseback
were taking form this weekend as
Rally Com, the Band, and student
body officers planned for the trip
south to the UCLA Homecoming.
