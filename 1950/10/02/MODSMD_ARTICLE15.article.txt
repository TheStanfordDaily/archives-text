# MEN AND WOMEN BOTH
## Dorms Filled to Capacity 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
A strange turn of events lias
struck Stanford this quarter: al
though there has been a slight de
crease in enrollment, men's and
women's residences arc filled to
record capacity.
flohle is housing a maximum of
268 girls, 241 of whom arc fresh
men. There arc 333 girls at La
gunita, romparcd to the peak j
reached last winter quarter when
the girls thought tlie.v were
crowded with 112(5. Branncr has
190, four more than last year's
total of 186.
Both the Union aryjl Row houses
are now filled to capacity.
The latest tabulations show that
there has been a slight increase in j
the number of undergraduate wom
enâ€”l,3so this quarter as compared
to last year's high winter quarter j
enrollment of 1,349.
Miss Elva Brown, counselor for
women, and Miss Adele Strogcn,
assistant counselor, gave several I
explanations for the overcrowded j
conditions now prevalent in wom
en's residences.
Tlii' main reason is that the
number of students expected to |

drop out of (he University has
fallen far out of propor(ion (o
(hose returning and (hose being
currently enrolled.
An unusually high percentage of
students who had taken leaves of
abscnce have returned this quarter,
in addition to almost no decrease in
women students flunking out.
The summer quarter program,
where students have the opportu
nity to return winter quarter if
they make the grade, has proved so
successful that there has been an
additional overflow of these stu
dents during the past few years.
With few students dropping out
and an excess returning, the scales
have been overbalanced, fven
though freshman enrollment has
remained about the same.
Miss Brown remarked that
even (hough (he limited amount
of space now available for (he
large number of undergraduate
women has given (he Housing
Committee many problems, the
girls have been most co-opera
tive. Furthermore, she said, (lie
causes for (he overcrowding are
good . . . (he girls haven't flunked

out and all those who have left
seem to want to eomr hark to (he
Farm.
The situation in men's residences
is almost the same story. The quota
of men students expected to drop
out was another surprising mis
calculation.
The changing draft regulations
left Men's Housing Com with a big
question mark as to how many stu
dents would return. With the pres
ent Selective Service rulings, how
ever, there has been little change
in enrollment due to the draft.
Figures show that men's dormi
tories arc now operating a( ca
pacity: 540 in Encina. 500 of
whom arc freshmen: 226 in S(ern;
286 in Tnyon, of whom 131 arc
freshmen; about 1,000 in (he Vil
lage, including 28 freshmen.
Men's Housing Com reported that
many more students than were ex
pected returned to the Village this
year. Among these were a hig"h
percentage of students who had
formerly lived off campus. Im
proved conditions at the Village and
the expense of living off campus
were offered as explanations.
