FRANKFURT, Germany â€” Hun
dreds of West German police,
swinging truncheons and spewing
water from powerful fire hoses,
charged a mob of rioting Commu
nists in Hamburg tonight and
smashed the only major demonstra
tion in the Reds long - heralded
"show of strength."
In every other major city in West
Germany the much - advertised
march of 200,000 Communists col
lapsed under determined police ac
tion and a drizzling rain.
More than 1,200 Communists
were arrested during the riots,
which the Soviet Zone radio termed
"great demonstrations for peace."
About 850 of them were arrested in
Hamburg, after a bloody three
hour free-for-all. The situation is
now reported under control.
