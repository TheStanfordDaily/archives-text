# Big Red Machine Rolls Along; USF Overwhelmed 55 to 7
## Kerkorian Passes Shine In Card Offensive Show 
### DWIGHT WILBUR Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford's red-hot grid machine, with quarterback Gary Kor
korian in the driver s seat, could do no wrong Saturday in piling uj
a 55 to 7 victory over Coach Joe Kuharich's deflated USF Dons.
Kerkorian literally picked the Don defense to pieces with hi
crafty ball handling and almost perfect passing. The Card ace lee

the Indian team to five touchdowns,
and completed eight out of 12 passes
for 91 yards.
The Dons never did recover from
Stanfords' devastating first quarter
attack which saw three Card
touchdowns in rapid-fire order.
Stanford drew its first blood when
Halfback Boyd Benson smashed over
from the USF 1, highlighting an im
pressive 81-yard march. Kerkorian,
who made seven out of eight con
version attempts, added the extra
point.
Then, shortly afterwards, end
Bruce Van Alstyne, who played a
great game for the Cards, rushed in
and hit Don QB Gene Sweetcrs, caus
ing him to fumble, and tackle Jim
Vick recovered for Stanford on the
USF 14. Four plays later, Stanford
had its second TD.
After the Indians' third on-sidc
kickofT, the Dons again went no
where and QB Ed Brown dropped
| back for a fourth down punt. Huge
Bill McColl of the Indians, who
sparked Stanford's defensive play,
charged in and smothered Brown's
attempted kick, sending the ball reel
ing backward toward the USF goal.
The Cards took over on the Don 24,
and seconds later Harry Hugasian
raced all the way to pay dirt, giving
Stanford a seemingly invincible
three-touchdown lead.
But it was Indian speedster Boh
Bryan who provided the crowd
[ with its greatest thrill of the aftcr
| noon. Taking USF's opening scc
: ond half kickolT on the goal line,
Bryan immediately headed upheld
j at full speed, lie picked up two
beautiful downfield blocks from
Bob White and Bill McColl and
then tightroped along the sidelines
into the clear.
Don halfback Joe Scudcro, the last
! man who possibly could have gotten
Bryan, cut over fast but the fleet
Card half outdistanced Scudcro to
the goal line as the Stanford fans
roared in approval.
USF's only moment of glory came
in the second quarter when Don
quarterback Brown heaved a 23-yard
touchdown pass to end Ralph Thomas
over the head of the Indians' de
fensive halfback. Harry Hugasian.
Stanford's potentially great hacks
! showed a 100 per rent improvement
over <hi' San Jose effort last week.
Fullback Bob (•riffin in particular
started faster and ran harder. Vct-
I eran halfbacks Benson. Hugasian,
I and Bobby White also turned in
lop-notch performances.
However, it was outstanding Slan
j ford line play that particularly
j pleased Coach Marchie Schwartz,
i Soph linemen Jim Vick and John
j Broderick and veterans Buss Pomc
roy and Jack Rye turned in bone-
crushing tackles that stopped the
USF offense cold.
Owen Powell, in his first starting
assignment for the Indians, per
formed admirably at his right guard
post, as did soph Norm Manoogian,
Indian left guard. Manoogian re-
I ceived a severe bruise early in the
I game, but returned to action later
[ in the contest.
Tackle Gordy White, who is suf
! fering from a sore ankle, and Half
: back Eric Southwood, out with a
I pulled muscle, saw little action
j against the Dons. It is hoped, how
| ever, that both men will be ready
j for the Stanford-Oregon State battle
i Saturday in Corvallis.

Stanford's red-hot grid machine, with quarterback Gary Kor
korian in the driver s seat, could do no wrong Saturday in piling uj
a 55 to 7 victory over Coach Joe Kuharich's deflated USF Dons.
Kerkorian literally picked the Don defense to pieces with hi
crafty ball handling and almost perfect passing. The Card ace lee

the Indian team to five touchdowns,
and completed eight out of 12 passes
for 91 yards.
The Dons never did recover from
Stanfords' devastating first quarter
attack which saw three Card
touchdowns in rapid-fire order.
Stanford drew its first blood when
Halfback Boyd Benson smashed over
from the USF 1, highlighting an im
pressive 81-yard march. Kerkorian,
who made seven out of eight con
version attempts, added the extra
point.

USF 14. Four plays later, Stanford
had its second TD.

Bill McColl of the Indians, who
sparked Stanford's defensive play,

attempted kick, sending the ball reel

The Cards took over on the Don 24,
and seconds later Harry Hugasian
raced all the way to pay dirt, giving
Stanford a seemingly invincible
three-touchdown lead.
But it was Indian speedster Boh
Bryan who provided the crowd

Bryan immediately headed upheld

beautiful downfield blocks from
Bob White and Bill McColl and
then tightroped along the sidelines

Don halfback Joe Scudcro, the last

Bryan, cut over fast but the fleet
Card half outdistanced Scudcro to
the goal line as the Stanford fans
roared in approval.
USF's only moment of glory came
