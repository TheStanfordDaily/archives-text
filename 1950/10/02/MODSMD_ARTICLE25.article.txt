# Homeless 14 Will Occupy KA Fraternity
## 
### 
Fourteen burned-out members of
"Alpha Salvatierra" were given
permission by the Interfraternity
Board of Control last, week to live
in the temporarily vacated Kappa
Alpha fraternity house until winter
quarter.
The 14 were left homeless on
Sept. 23 when the upper two storie:.
of their house on Salvatierra Street
went up in flames.
Last spring quarter, the KA's
were barred from their house until
winter quarter, 1951, due to a vio
lation of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
In other IFB business, the board
decided to recommend to Interfra
ternity Council that all sophomores
be allowed to move right into the
fraternity houses they
pledged. Previously, soph transfei
could be pledged immediately but.
could not move into fraternity
houses for one quarter.
