# Turkey for Big Game?
## 
### 
Stanford students can have turkey during
their Big Game celebration this year that is, if
they want it.
Excorn last week heard a recommendation
from Cardinals that the campus go ahead with
normal social functions from Nov. 22-25 in spite
cf Thanksgiving.
The only alternative mentioned was for the
student body to hold premature rallies, dances,
bonfires, etc., on Monday and Tuesday of the
big week.
For students who have experienced the thrill
of Big Games activities which increase every
hour as the game approaches, the early cele
bration seems to spell SNAFU beyond a doubt.
By looking at the schedule of events for Big
Game Week, it becomes apparent what a total
Hop the festivities would be if half the students
made their exit over the Thanksgiving holiday.
The Gaieties, largest stage production of the
year at Stanford, runs Wednesday through Fri
day night. Ram's Head might suffer a serious
financial loss if a large share of the students
chose to go home.
The success of the Big Game boxifire and
rally, slated for Thursday night, is entirely de
pendent on the spirit of the new freshman class.
Hundreds of Encina-man-hours are needed to
build the fire to its customary 40-odd feet.
Without adequate freshman guards on cam
pus on the nights preceding the Big Game, the
Quad would be a vulnerable target for amateur
painters from the other side of the Bay.
On the positive side, a double holiday on
Thursday and Friday v/ould provide 48 hours
for fraternities and dorms to work on parade
floats and house decorations. There wouldn't
Le empty seats in Western Civ classes as the

men of '54 gather wood for the fire.
Did you ever notice how the second set of
midterms fall on the Wednesday before
Thanksgiving quite frequently? This year stu
dents will have adequate time to prepare for
these because they can leave non-classroom
activities for Thursday and Friday.
Although all Big Game Week festivities mean
excitement for all of the Stanford family, the
real objective toward which we are working is
a Big Game victory and the return of the Axe
to the Farm.
Coach Marchie Schwartz definitely favors the
bonfire rally Thursday night. The highest emo
tional pitch is reached at this pre-game rally.
The rally is held too far ahead of game-time,
the enthusiasm can diminish —and with that,
the chance for a Big Game victory.
The problem of a Thanksgiving holiday in the
midst of the traditional Big Game Week has not
occurred since several years before the war.
As has been pointed out by some, the Big
Game in years past was not accompanied by
the students activities and enthusiasm gener
ated since the war. It was formerly just a
chance for the old alums to hold reunions and
drink to the future of Stanford.
Now however, the alumni celebrations have
even been overshadowed by the more youth
ful carousing of students from both schools.
For this reason, the decision lies with the stu
dents — who can make or break Big Game
Week. Parents often put in an urgent request
for their students to come home for Thanks
giving.
Your answer to their letter may decide
whether Stanford's biggest Big Game is to be
a complete success.
