# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
They love me in the Romantic Languages Depart
ment. And if it hadn't been for the fact that I went a
minus 27 in the alien tongue business of the lower
division, I would have probably become very fond of
the RL profs. I really enjoyed those languages, they
were every bit as much fun as tackling Bill McColl
without pads or burping loudly in Dr. Bailey's 10
o'clock. And I got just as much out of it.
My (iist experience with the LD (low-down) re
quirements was under M. Puddle of the French De
partment. M. Puddle, who was a very dapper dresser,
drew pictures of women (presumably French) on the
blackboard and taught me, in a half-hour session
after class, how to tie a Windsor knot in his tie. Out
side of that, all I remember from French is that "port"
means door, or left, or wine, or something like that.
Being still young and easily discouraged, I took my
D and in h-pite of assurances from the head of the
department that "Monsieur Puddle would not have
given you such a magnificent grade unless he had
thought you marvelously prepared for French II." I
registered for Spanish I.
There I met a very nice instructor named Joe. The
class called him Senior something-or-other, but I
wasn't fai enough advanced for that, so Joe and I got
along pretty well. He wanted me to go into an adver
ti: ioy agency in San Jose with him.
1 told him that I would like to have a quarter to
think it over, and 1 got a C in Spanish I. I then told
him that I wasn't interested in his business proposal
and I got a D in Spanish 11. There was something about
Joe that did inspire confidence, however.
I here was one chap that kept shouting, "Franco!
franco! Franco!" waving his arms wildly, every time
we met on campus. I assumed that this gentlrnan
was from the French Department.
My friendship with Joe waned somewhat after S—II,
and I came across another very nice prof in the Span
ish Depaitment, Senior Shultzenheim. He, with in
finite wisdom and mercy, and the gentle kindness
cr Ujlly reserved for saints, saw me through this diffi
cult period S-111, sometimes known as "the short-cut
to Gal. After finals, Senior Shultzenheim sent me a
postcard which read, to the best of my recollection,
"Yo did muy bien sur la final." I got a D.
But at last I was through with those fiive unit
classes, now I would breeze through S-21 and 22,

which—l was told—wore simple reading courses.
I reckoned without Senior Pint-o. (Never did figure
out what it was a pint of, but . . .) I will never forget
Senior Pint-o's first lecture.
He stood in his friendly long-legged stance, non
chalantly twirling his Phi Beta Kappa key, and said,
in his easy, broken English, manner: "I never flunk
anybody in this class."
Later Senior Pint-o took me aside, and breathing
delicately into my left ear he said, "Don't worry about
flunking those midterms MISTER Berry (there were
many people in the class: Senior Soper, Seniora Jones,
Seniorita Smith, but I was always MISTER Berry),
I will give you every break I can in this class."
He did. The second time I took Spanish 21 was from
a prof from Chile, Senior Rocogoodo. He managed to
inspire much interest (or as they say in Spanish,
much interesto) in S-21 for me. Also, we both liked a
Chilean night-club singer named Malu Gatica, who
was currently warbling at one of the Sunset Strip
spots which neither of us could afford to go to.
During the final I was able to apply all that Senior
(I now called him MISTER) Pint-o had taught me and
along with Senior Rocogoodo's great help, I got a
D-plus in the course. I was proud.
S-22, after the marvelous preparation I had received
in my previous courses, was a cinch. Had a very ex
cellent prof named Senior Sorenson, who realized that
i was nearing the end of my wonderful experience in
Romantic (sigh) languages. Also I disocvered, some
what belatedly, I hat the head of the Spanish Depart
ment was an old Sigma Louie (my tong), and I fear
lessly called on the beloved bonds of brothership to
aid me in the past lap of what the department called
' the great adventure."
The bonds, and Senior Sorenson's kindness got me
a D, and my mother was proud of me. (I told her I
got an A-mirius.)
Now I wish to take this opportunity to thank the
men in KL (Senioi Pint-o excepted. He should be
refling basketball games) for their kindness and con
sideration in leading me to my ultimate destiny. And
I know that their key-speckled chests will swell with
pride as I demonstrate the wondrous wealth of knowl
edge they have imparted to me: "Yo no hablo Espafiol
pas."
Or, as Napoleon once said, "Fermez la porte!"
