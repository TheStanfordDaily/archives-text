# Stanford to Host WSSF Conference
## 
### 
Stanford University will host the delegates to the California
World Student Service Fund conference when they convene here
Oct. 14 and 15.
The purpose of the conference, which will draw some 120 stu
dents from California'colleges, is to instruct the delegates in the

method of setting up WSSF on their
respective campuses.
The international organization,
which was established alter the
war, works to promote scholarships
and obtain books and other mate
rials for students. The Communist
counterpart of the WSSF is the In
ternational Union of Youth, and
recently the two organizations have
been clashing in the Far East.
Although Stanford does not have
a WSSF group, the organization is
familiar to Stanford students inter
ested in student relief work. Each
year part of the money collected in
the lIR drive goes to WSSF. For
this reason lIR president Al Nichols
encourages Stanford students to at
tend the WSSF sessions so that they
may see the benefits of giving their
money to the cause of other stu
dents.
The convention agenda for Sat
urday includes a WSSF orientation
program where the history, pro
gram, problems and techniques, and
principles of the organization will
be discussed. Sunday will feature
an international panel of speakers
who will talk on "A Report on the
World University Community."
Other seminars and addresses are
also scheduled at the conference.
Dick Thomas of Los Angeles is
the WSSF regional director.
