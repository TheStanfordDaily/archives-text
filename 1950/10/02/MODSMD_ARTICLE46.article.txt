# Indian Spirits High After Don Massacre
## Severe Injuries of Toler and Alois Cause Deeper Gloom to USF Squad 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford players and coaches alike agreed that Saturday's 55-7
win over the San Francisco Dons represented one of the finest
team efforts in recent Indian history.
Bill McColl, whose magnificent defensive work at end and line
backer was a game standout, sounded the keynote for the happy

Marchiemen. "I don't think that
USF was overrated, or that the
Dons were 'down' for the game. It
was simply a terrific team victory
lor Stanford. The only thing to
compare with it is last year's USC
game at the Coliseum."
Coach Schwartz echoed the sen
timents of his potential All-Ameri
can protege. "I can't single out
many men for their play in this
game — they all played beautiful
ball. And we didn't beat a push
over. USF has a good ball club "
The Indian mentor was particu
larly pleased with the blocking and
tackling of his men—two phases of
the pigskin art which left much to
be desired as far as the Redskins
were concerned last week against
Sun Jose State.

Psychologically, Schwartz em
phasized the USF game could easily
have been the turning point of the
season. If Stanford had lost, he
pointed out, the Indians might not
have been able to recover their
winning spirit. "As it was, the
game gave us a nice lift. I wish
we could play every game of the
season like this one."
The Farm headman, later in the
interview, did mention some indi
vidual performances when he sin
gled out five of his newer linemen
for special note. The lauded quin
tet were Jim Vick, John Broderick,
Norm Manoogian, Jess Cone, and
Rod Garner. "We were very much
pleased with the way these boys

held up. We now know that we can
depend on them for some heavy
work the rest of the season."
All are new to the squad this
year with the exception of Cone, a
junior letterman.
Over on the other side of the En
cina gym, gloom reigned supreme.
Coach Joe Kuharich had not only
lost a ball game; he was also faced
with the loss of two of his key men,
Burl Toler and Art Alois.
The two Dons, both linemen, re
ceived possible leg and elbow frac
tures, respectively.
Two sentiments were repeated
ovr and over by the disheartened
Kuharich:
1. USF was "pressing" through
out the contest and never got a
real chance to show its stuff.
2. The Dons were overmatched.
"We can't matcji these strong
PCC teams unless we get the
breaks. Stanford got them today,
and they took advantage of them.
But that's good hall"
Panther - like Oilie Matson, who
didn't get much chance to display
his vaunted All-American talents,
was also convinced that the Dons
didn't play the game they are ca
pable of. "Those first two touch
downs were tough on us —it was
hard to get going after that," the
big fullback added.
When asked what he thought of
Stanford's Bowl chances, Matson
hedged diplomatically, "I'll tell you
more about that after we play Cal."
USF meets Berkeley's Golden
Bears Nov. 18 —the week before the
Big Game.
