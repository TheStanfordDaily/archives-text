# Four Future Indian Foes Chalk Up Weekend Wins
## 
### AL BERRY 
Stanford's remaining eight foot
ball opponents fared well — some
surprisingly well —in a weekend of
stunning upsets. Four of the future
enemies dashed over opponents,
three met dismal defeat, and one
was idle. But the ones that won
did so decisively, and the Schwartz
men may well develop some pig
skin ulcers worrying about what
the crystal ball holds in store.
Probable the biggest surprise of
the weekend occurred when the
Huskies of the University of Wash
ington unleashed a ground attack
that completely demolished Bernie
Bierman's Golden Gophers, 28 to 13.
And it was no freak tally-tipping
that allowed the Huskies to score
their first blitz over Minnesota in
the 14 - year - old series. Phi Bete
candidate Hugh McElhenny and
pass pitcher Don Heinrich led the
Seattleites in a game where the
Huskies were never outplayed.
All Washington
The amazing Huskies trampled
up 16 first downs to Minnesota's 13,
gained 231 ground yards to 222, and
passed for 102 to 122. It was Wash
ington, Washington, Washington,
and a new candidate for the often
talked-about but seldom seen Rose
Bowl.
Santa Clara, Stanford's next home
opponent, just didn't have it again
this week as the Owls of Rice Uni
versity stormed over them for a
neat 27 to 7 victory. The Broncs
played drop the football for the
Owls, losing the pill three times in
crucial spots, and the Texas boys
piled up 217 yards in the air to
Santa Clara's meager 48 That was
the story.
Bears Win Again
The Berkeley Bears won another
easy victory over another easy foe
last Saturday, as Jim Aiken's achin'
Ducks stumbled, fumbled, and fell
to a 28 to 7 loss. Cal's Pete Scha
barum nailed two tallies and it was
a pleasant day for the Waldorfs in
spite of a surprisingly potent Ore
gon ground game. The Bears get
their first real test next week when
they meet Pennsylvania on the far
side of the Bay Bridge.
Outlined against the blue - gray
Coliseum arc-lights, the lowly rated
lads from lowa started the week's
upsets Friday night as they pum
meled Jeff Cravath's depth-loaded
but listless Trojans 20 to 13 in a
game that wasn't as close as the
score indicates.
What could very well be the best
team on the coast. Red Sanders'
baby-blue Bruins, blasted a hapless
bunch of Washington Staters 42 to
0. Well over half of the UCLA tal
lies were set up by WSC fumbles,

but the roaring 20,000 in the Me
morial Coliseum were no less
pleased. It was a slaughter all the
way, with UCLA getting 23 first
downs to the Pullman Company's
7, 406 yards to 32 on the ground,
and 156 to 90 in the air. No con
test
Army Rolls
Army's murderous Black Knights
of the Hudson blasted a highly re
spectable Colgate eleven 28 to 0
in Michie Stadium last Saturday.
Sparked by Knights Stephenson,
Pollack, Pollard, and "Hurry" Cain,
the Woo-Pooers ripped off a few
94-, 55-, and 47-yard runs to crush
the toothpasters.
Oregon State College, which
meets Stanford in Corvallis next
week, had a bye last week and pre
sumably recovered from the 38 to
13 lacing handed them by the lads
from Michigan State. The East Lan
sing boys, by the way, tripped
mighty Michigan U last week 14
to 7.
If the Stanfords can beat OSC
this week, it will be the first time
they have accomplished it in Cor
vallis since 1922. Which is a nice
thought to end this with.

stunning upsets. Four of the future
enemies dashed over opponents,
three met dismal defeat, and one
was idle. But the ones that won
did so decisively, and the Schwartz
men may well develop some pig
skin ulcers worrying about what
the crystal ball holds in store.
Probable the biggest surprise of
the weekend occurred when the
Huskies of the University of Wash
ington unleashed a ground attack
that completely demolished Bernie
Bierman's Golden Gophers, 28 to 13.
And it was no freak tally-tipping
that allowed the Huskies to score
their first blitz over Minnesota in
the 14 - year - old series. Phi Bete
candidate Hugh McElhenny and
pass pitcher Don Heinrich led the
Seattleites in a game where the
Huskies were never outplayed.
All Washington
The amazing Huskies trampled
up 16 first downs to Minnesota's 13,
gained 231 ground yards to 222, and
passed for 102 to 122. It was Wash
ington, Washington, Washington,
and a new candidate for the often
talked-about but seldom seen Rose
Bowl.
Santa Clara, Stanford's next home
opponent, just didn't have it again
this week as the Owls of Rice Uni
versity stormed over them for a
neat 27 to 7 victory. The Broncs
played drop the football for the
Owls, losing the pill three times in
crucial spots, and the Texas boys
piled up 217 yards in the air to
Santa Clara's meager 48 That was
the story.
Bears Win Again
The Berkeley Bears won another
easy victory over another easy foe
last Saturday, as Jim Aiken's achin'
Ducks stumbled, fumbled, and fell
to a 28 to 7 loss. Cal's Pete Scha
barum nailed two tallies and it was
a pleasant day for the Waldorfs in
spite of a surprisingly potent Ore
gon ground game. The Bears get
their first real test next week when
they meet Pennsylvania on the far
side of the Bay Bridge.
Outlined against the blue - gray
Coliseum arc-lights, the lowly rated
lads from lowa started the week's
upsets Friday night as they pum
meled Jeff Cravath's depth-loaded
but listless Trojans 20 to 13 in a
game that wasn't as close as the
score indicates.
What could very well be the best
team on the coast. Red Sanders'
baby-blue Bruins, blasted a hapless
bunch of Washington Staters 42 to
0. Well over half of the UCLA tal
lies were set up by WSC fumbles,

but the roaring 20,000 in the Me
morial Coliseum were no less
pleased. It was a slaughter all the
way, with UCLA getting 23 first
downs to the Pullman Company's
7, 406 yards to 32 on the ground,
and 156 to 90 in the air. No con
test
Army Rolls
Army's murderous Black Knights
of the Hudson blasted a highly re
spectable Colgate eleven 28 to 0
in Michie Stadium last Saturday.
Sparked by Knights Stephenson,
Pollack, Pollard, and "Hurry" Cain,
the Woo-Pooers ripped off a few
94-, 55-, and 47-yard runs to crush
the toothpasters.
Oregon State College, which
meets Stanford in Corvallis next
week, had a bye last week and pre
sumably recovered from the 38 to
13 lacing handed them by the lads
from Michigan State. The East Lan
sing boys, by the way, tripped
mighty Michigan U last week 14
to 7.
If the Stanfords can beat OSC
this week, it will be the first time
they have accomplished it in Cor
vallis since 1922. Which is a nice
thought to end this with.
Stanford's remaining eight foot
ball opponents fared well — some
surprisingly well —in a weekend of
stunning upsets. Four of the future
