and then drove eight miles beyond the border into North Korean
territory. In multiprong drives U.S. Marines, infantrymen, and
ROK troops fanned out from Seoul (1) toward the parallel, less
than 10 miles from advance spearheads. U.S. 7th Division units
dashed 23 miles east to capture Inchon, aiming (broken arrow) to
link up with ROK divisions (2) driving northward on a 65-mile
front. Korean Communists were concentrating in a line (3) cen
