### 
TOKYO, Monday, Oct. 2 (UP) â€”South Korean troops smashed
through barbed wire defenses north of the 38th parallel today as
the North Koreans declined to answer Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's
demand for their immediate surrender.
While the South Koreans crossed the parallel which has divided

North and South Korea, the U.S.
Marines on the opposite side of the
peninsula advanced to within 10
miles of the border.
Front dispatches reported that
advance patrols of the Republic of
Korea Third Division near the east
coast had pushed as far as eight
miles into North Korean territory
Sunday before withdrawing during
the night.
United Press correspondent
Robert BcnnvholT reported from
Kangnung that troops of the
Third Division had crossed the
38th parallel in force and swept
ahead about two miles before
running into barbed wire entan
glements.
American spotter planes reported
this morning that spearheads of the
Third Division had pushed through
these defenses and were nearly four
miles north of the parallel.
The South Koreans reported they
met enemy machinegun fire along
the coastal highway as they drove
toward Yangyang, six miles north
of the border.
Recently captured prisoners have
said the Communists planned to
make a determined stand at Yang
yang, but air observers could not.
locate any large numbers of enemy
troops in the area.
BennyhofT said advance elements
of the South Korean Capitol Divi
sion were in the Sorim-ni area, two
miles below the parallel, although
earlier reports said troops of this
division already had crossed the
boundary.
While the Allied spearhead
pushed across the 38th parallel, the
Chinese Communists threatened to
enter the war on the side of their
Red neighbors in Korea. Premier
Chou En-lai said Communist China
"will not stand aside" if North Ko
rea is invaded.
