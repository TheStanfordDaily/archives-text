# New Delivery Window at PO
## 
### 
The second general delivery win
dow at the Post Office has been re
opened to handle the increased vol
ume of mail at the beginning of the
quarter.
The second window has been
open since Saturday and divides the
general delivery section into A-M
and N-Z lines, allowing faster dis
tribution of the mail.
Superintendent John Callahan
urged students not to have their
mail addressed to general delivery
unless it is to be their permanent
address, in order to relieve the con
gestion in this section. Students
will receive their mail much faster
if they make sure the correct ad
dress is used on their letters, either
general delivery, box number, or
residence, Callahan said. Form 22b
should be used to notify publishers
of change of address.
