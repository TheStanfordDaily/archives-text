# Prof. Knoles to Talk About Japan At First Tuesday Evening Series
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
Professor George H. Knoles wil!
speak tonight on "The United States
find Japan" in the quarter's first
Tuesday Evening Series program at
7:30 in the Memorial Auditorium.
The rssociate professor of history
recently returned from Japan
where he and four other Stanford
faculty members were visiting in
j structors at the University of Tokyo
I during the summer, teaching Japa
! nese professors and graduate stu-
I dents the latest developments in
American scholarship.
But there's one exoerience which
the professor probably won t men
tion tonight, if only because it has
no educational or political impor
tance—
"Professor Joseph S. Davis (Food
Research Institute), Professor John
D. Gohcen (philosophy), and I wore
guests at a dinner given by a sect
of the Shinto re'iginn," Dr. Knoles
laughingly recalls, "and we had to
follow the formal dictates of Japa
nese hospitality.
Balli Brforc Feast
"First off, the three of us un
dressed and. in the native custom,
all climbed into one big tub and
bathed. Then, attired in kimonos,
j we ate a lavish feast including su
; kiyakai. saki, and beer.(The beer
was less than 3.2.) After dinner
i we retired to our room to change,
and in walked three maids to help
us dress." It took the professors a
! lohg time to recover from this un-
I usual Japanese custom.

Dr. Knoles has been teaching his
tory at Stanford since 1937, except
ior two years he spent as an ofli
cer in the Navy during World War
11. The quiet professor says he was
a second Mr. Roberts "I never saw
any action." But he did spend the
last four months of his service on

the staff of the Commander in Chief
of the Pacific Fleet, helping to write
an administrative history of the
CINPAC during the war.
The historian did not think it odd
to be teaching the very people he
had fought against but four years
ngo.

"The Japanese showed no hostil
ity and were, in fact, quite eager
students," he explained. "Japan
isolated itself from the Western
World in the 1930 s and lost track
of our achievements; so the schol
ars were anxious to learn."
The middle-aged professor, mar
ried and the father of two daugh
ters, says he made up his mind to
become a history teacher when he
was a sophomore in high school. At
the time, his father was teaching
history, "which may have had
something to do with it." Dr. Knolcs
says. His father is now chancellor
of the Co'lege of the Pacific.
The social and intellectual history
of the United States is Professor
Knolcs' major interest. The author
j of numerous historical articles, he
is currently writing a book on Brit
| ish criticism of American culture
since 1919.
Visiting Professor
He has been visiting professor at
j several colleges during his teaching
career, including the universities at
[ Tokyo and Hokkaido this summer.
He says that Stanford and Stanford
students are definitely the best, but
there's a touch of fond remem
brance in his words when he rc
j calls that his Japanese students
J would rise and bow to him as he
entered the classroom.
"No Stanford clans hns done that
| yet," Dr. Knoles sighed.


PROFESSOR GEORGE H. KNOLES will open the Tuesday Eve

the time, his father was teaching
history, "which may have had
something to do with it." Dr. Knolcs
says. His father is now chancellor
of the Co'lege of the Pacific.
The social and intellectual history
of the United States is Professor
Knolcs' major interest. The author
j of numerous historical articles, he
is currently writing a book on Brit
| ish criticism of American culture
since 1919.
Visiting Professor
He has been visiting professor at
j several colleges during his teaching
career, including the universities at
[ Tokyo and Hokkaido this summer.
He says that Stanford and Stanford
students are definitely the best, but
there's a touch of fond remem
brance in his words when he rc
j calls that his Japanese students
J would rise and bow to him as he
entered the classroom.
"No Stanford clans hns done that
| yet," Dr. Knoles sighed.

Professor George H. Knoles wil!
speak tonight on "The United States
find Japan" in the quarter's first
Tuesday Evening Series program at
7:30 in the Memorial Auditorium.
The rssociate professor of history
recently returned from Japan
where he and four other Stanford
faculty members were visiting in
j structors at the University of Tokyo
I during the summer, teaching Japa
! nese professors and graduate stu-
I dents the latest developments in
American scholarship.
But there's one exoerience which
the professor probably won t men
tion tonight, if only because it has
no educational or political impor
tance—
"Professor Joseph S. Davis (Food
Research Institute), Professor John
D. Gohcen (philosophy), and I wore
guests at a dinner given by a sect
of the Shinto re'iginn," Dr. Knoles
laughingly recalls, "and we had to
follow the formal dictates of Japa
nese hospitality.
Balli Brforc Feast
"First off, the three of us un
dressed and. in the native custom,
all climbed into one big tub and
bathed. Then, attired in kimonos,
j we ate a lavish feast including su
; kiyakai. saki, and beer.(The beer
was less than 3.2.) After dinner
i we retired to our room to change,
and in walked three maids to help
us dress." It took the professors a
! lohg time to recover from this un-
I usual Japanese custom.

Dr. Knoles has been teaching his
tory at Stanford since 1937, except
ior two years he spent as an ofli
cer in the Navy during World War
11. The quiet professor says he was
a second Mr. Roberts "I never saw
any action." But he did spend the
last four months of his service on

the staff of the Commander in Chief
of the Pacific Fleet, helping to write
an administrative history of the
CINPAC during the war.
The historian did not think it odd
to be teaching the very people he
had fought against but four years
ngo.

"The Japanese showed no hostil
ity and were, in fact, quite eager
students," he explained. "Japan
isolated itself from the Western
World in the 1930 s and lost track
of our achievements; so the schol
ars were anxious to learn."
The middle-aged professor, mar
ried and the father of two daugh
ters, says he made up his mind to
become a history teacher when he
was a sophomore in high school. At
the time, his father was teaching
history, "which may have had

says. His father is now chancellor
