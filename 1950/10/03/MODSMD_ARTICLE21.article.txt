# Ratio Fixed at 2.9; Reg Down to 7,694
## 
### 
With an enrollment of 100 more
women and almost .'5OO less men
than last year, the ratio has dropped
to 2.9, as compared to last year'::
ratio of 3.2. This quarter's total
now stands at 7,694 students.
The total enrollment of men is
now 5,717, while last year the en
rollment was 6,014. This year 1,077
women registered as compared with
1,877 enrolled at this time in 1949.
Dean of Students Donald Winbig
ler said that the 7,694 figure is very
close to what the Registrar's oflicc
had anticipated.
Although the number of men stu
dents has decreased, the drop is
slight as compared to the decrease
experienced by other universities.
This indicates, as Winbiglor pointed
out, that Stanford men are contin
uing their education despite draft
threats and unsettled world condi
tions.
