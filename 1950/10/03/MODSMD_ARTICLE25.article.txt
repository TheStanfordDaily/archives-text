Friendliness within the Stanford Family has
always Leen an important phase of life on the
Farm. But when the time comes for hospitality
to students of other schools, there is much to
be desired.
This became apparent to us two years ago
when the UCLA Bruins entertained the Stan
lords at the Westwood homecoming, just as
they aie planning to do this year.
1'iee meals, housing, transportation were
only a few of the courtesies extended to the
Stanford Band. The irony of it was that several
bandsmen lrom UCLA said their student body
had vowed to give the Indians a royal welcome
in contrast to a very haphazard treatment in
Palo Alto at the hands of the ASSU welcoming
committee.
The special invitation —in person—from the
UCLA students revives the memories of our
enjoyable stay on their campus two years ago.
It should become a stimulus for more hospit
able treatment of visiting students corning to
the Farm in future weeks.
Traditionally a part of the Saturday afternoon
spectacle in the Stadium has been the huge
cardinal banner flaunting the letters "STAN
FORD" across the field at our opponents.
For two weeks now we have been disap
pointed in seeing no banner waving defiance
at the streamers ol San Jose and the University
of San Francisco on the north rim of the Sta
dium.

We're looking forward to those November
football games that get under way at 2 instead
of 2:30 p.m. It's too bad when a whole section
of rooters has to sit shivering in the shade until
after 5 o'clock. All other colleges in this area
seem to stick to the orthodox 2 p.m. kickoff.
Besides, that rush from the Stadium just
barely squeezes us in for dinner.

Speaking of rushing, the speeding traffic on
campus will continue we suppose until some
last moving car sends some student to the hos
pital.
Present budgets don't allow for more lights
on Stanford's darkened streets. Dark intersec
tions, especially, sound an ominous warning of
danger to pedestrians unless drivers consider
the results.

For students who host visitors in their offices
in the Union, the messy sight of coffee cups,
milk bottles, and paper strewn around the
snack bar and in Union Court constitute a real
eyesore.
Student pride in a clean Union and Nitery
has never been too evident to us. Perhaps such
small matters as this should find its way to the
Excom agenda.

One of the most tightly scheduled organiza
tions on campus is the Committee on Public
Exercises, which arranges the dates for all
major affairs in Stanford's auditoriums.
Meeting chairmen of campus organizations
should plan ahead and make early reservations
for auditorium facilities.
Remember last year, how hundreds of stu
dents poured into Cubberley Auditorium to
see the movies of the USC game played in Los
Angeles. Early planning might make it possi
ble for the student body to see the UCLA game
- which is out of town—in the much larger
Memorial Auditorium

Although diets are scientifically planned in
all campus dormitories, there are some things
that even science can't plan for. Remember
when Encina Commons served onions on the
night of the Reg Dance? 'Nuff said.
