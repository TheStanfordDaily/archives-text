# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
The Farm may be a game preserve but there's no
protection for the poor bird they call the Stanford
Rough. It's open .season on him the year around—
witness the tragic slaughter over the summer. They
had so many weddings at the Chapel the janitor is cam
paigning for free love. I felt sorry for him till I heard
lie's making a fortune selling reclaimed rice to the
Chinese Club.
I didn't mind all the weddings though, 'cause the re
ceptions were sure fun . . . and did I meet a lot of
guys! In fact, next year they may switch me to cloak
room attendant and I'll meet some girls.
But I did figure out a way to lick the slimy palm
situation in receiving lines (before they told me it was
in bad taste) but it didn't pay.
I up a dusting station at the start of the receiving
lint . . everyone held out his hand as he went by
and 1 du: ted it with talcum powder . . . then 1 held
out mine and they ground then 1 cigarettes out in it. I
didn't mind their not paying, but why'd they have to
make an ash of me?
The worst part of any reception though is the best
man's toast to the bride—that is unless it's not a wed
ding reception, in which case it's the best part. (Best
part, worst part . . . whoinell goes for anything but
the champagne anyhow?)
Watch the best man before his big moment comes
. . . man and moment they're all alike. You can al
ways upot the miserable wretch beforehand, slinking
aiound the fringes of the crowd, muttering to himself
like a law student as he practices his delivery. Sud
denly you can see he feels the time has come . . . he
matches a drink from a passing tray and downs it in

one convulsive gasp . . . then with a wild look in his
eye and a spastic lurch he's on top of the nearest chair
and shouting, "A toast to the bride!"
In the sudden silence that falls over the room you
can hear the stomach of the stately matron on your
left growling like an angry lion. But it's only a mo
ment before backs are turned and the wave of chatter
and clinking glasses fills the room again . . . leaving
our poor Launcelot high and dry, holding his upraised
grail and grinning vacantly out over the crowd. Inevi
tably at this point that enchanting little flower girl over
in the corner tugs at her mother and asks, "Mummy,
what's that funny looking man standing on top of the
chair for? . . ."
But v/eddings are beautiful . . . I'll never forget my
own, though God knows I've tried. We were married
with military honors . . . you know, crossed shotguns.
And what a bride Latakiea made! I can see her now
floating down the aisle (she was young and so fright
ened), like a queen in her gown of purple tulle, and
her veil of red tulle, and her bodice of black tulle (she
never could forget the night her father caught us, out
in the toolies).
My heart pounded as I slipped the pipe fitting over
her finger (if fit snugly) . . . "Latakeia," I whispered
(1 called her Latakeia 'cause she smelled like a Turk),
"kiss me." "Shut up, eunuch!" she cried, "I've had
enough of your lip!"
Then I lost her in the crowd and if wasn't till I came
fo Stanford that I saw her apain. It turned out she met
AI Berry at a Romanic Languages Convention and de
cided that il they fed you thai well she'd come to Stan
ford too.
Now 1 hear she's ghost writing for him.

But v/eddings are beautiful . . . I'll never forget my
own, though God knows I've tried. We were married
with military honors . . . you know, crossed shotguns.
And what a bride Latakiea made! I can see her now
floating down the aisle (she was young and so fright
ened), like a queen in her gown of purple tulle, and
her veil of red tulle, and her bodice of black tulle (she
never could forget the night her father caught us, out
in the toolies).
My heart pounded as I slipped the pipe fitting over
her finger (if fit snugly) . . . "Latakeia," I whispered
(1 called her Latakeia 'cause she smelled like a Turk),
"kiss me." "Shut up, eunuch!" she cried, "I've had
enough of your lip!"
Then I lost her in the crowd and if wasn't till I came
fo Stanford that I saw her apain. It turned out she met
AI Berry at a Romanic Languages Convention and de
cided that il they fed you thai well she'd come to Stan
ford too.
Now 1 hear she's ghost writing for him.
The Farm may be a game preserve but there's no
protection for the poor bird they call the Stanford
Rough. It's open .season on him the year around—
witness the tragic slaughter over the summer. They
had so many weddings at the Chapel the janitor is cam
paigning for free love. I felt sorry for him till I heard
lie's making a fortune selling reclaimed rice to the
Chinese Club.
I didn't mind all the weddings though, 'cause the re
ceptions were sure fun . . . and did I meet a lot of
guys! In fact, next year they may switch me to cloak
room attendant and I'll meet some girls.
But I did figure out a way to lick the slimy palm
situation in receiving lines (before they told me it was
in bad taste) but it didn't pay.
I up a dusting station at the start of the receiving
lint . . everyone held out his hand as he went by
and 1 du: ted it with talcum powder . . . then 1 held
out mine and they ground then 1 cigarettes out in it. I
didn't mind their not paying, but why'd they have to
make an ash of me?
The worst part of any reception though is the best
man's toast to the bride—that is unless it's not a wed
ding reception, in which case it's the best part. (Best
part, worst part . . . whoinell goes for anything but
the champagne anyhow?)
Watch the best man before his big moment comes
. . . man and moment they're all alike. You can al
ways upot the miserable wretch beforehand, slinking
aiound the fringes of the crowd, muttering to himself
like a law student as he practices his delivery. Sud
denly you can see he feels the time has come . . . he
matches a drink from a passing tray and downs it in

one convulsive gasp . . . then with a wild look in his
eye and a spastic lurch he's on top of the nearest chair
and shouting, "A toast to the bride!"
In the sudden silence that falls over the room you
can hear the stomach of the stately matron on your
left growling like an angry lion. But it's only a mo
ment before backs are turned and the wave of chatter
and clinking glasses fills the room again . . . leaving
our poor Launcelot high and dry, holding his upraised
grail and grinning vacantly out over the crowd. Inevi
tably at this point that enchanting little flower girl over
in the corner tugs at her mother and asks, "Mummy,
what's that funny looking man standing on top of the
chair for? . . ."
