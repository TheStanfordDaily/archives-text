A wire-haired car chaser found himself boosted to
j l -ry at USC last week when the student body elected
him to the title of Ceurge Tirebiter II, succeeding the
bite George Tirebiter I as the school's official mascot.
George the Second nosed out Hector the Horse by
a vote of 800 to 518.
The original Tirebiter died this summer of injuries
i (-reived when he v/as struck by a car while pursuing
his favorite game, that of nipping white sidewalls of
passing automobiles.

TJSC coeds lost their favorable portion of the ratio
last week as the director of admissions announced that
for the first time in years women students outnum
bered men students.
The topsy-turvy ratio, which brought back memo
ries of World War II, was blamed partially on the de
crease in student veterans.
Total enrollment for the school as of Thursday was
20 053, an 11 per cent decrease over fall, 1949.

So you think Stanford is well insulated from the
events of earth-shaking significance in New York,
Washington, Moscow, and Korea? Well, the boys down
at Thomas Jefferson's university seem to have built
an even higher ivory tower for themselves.
For even now, the U. of Virginia's Cavalier Daily
not only confines nation news off the UP wire to a
small corner of the front page, but it still entitles the
UP coiumn—not "This Morning's Headlines" or any
thing like that—but "The Outside World."

I if" at UCLA, as reported by a recent Daily ttruiii:
A combination tragedy-comedy broke during July

as a tale of some gullible sorority girls and an ex-con
centration camp inmate was gradually unfolded. The
man, who had been imprisoned in Dachau and Buch
iriwald, had developed a mental condition in which he
sought to inHict pain as a relief.
He visited lhe Pi Beta Phi, Kappa Kappa Gamma,
and Delta Zeta houses, telling the girls he was a
movie talent scout looking for actresses who could
show pain. At the first two houses he used his belt
to smack them, while the Delta Zeta girls loaned him
llieii ping pong paddles for the impromptu spankings.
The fourth house, that of the Kappa Deltas, proved
to be bis downfall as the girls summoned the campus
police. The swatter was sentenced to 10 days in the
county jail and was advised by the trial judge to con
tinue private psychiatric treatments.

Letter from a father to his freshman son at the Uni
versity of Kansas, in reply to a request for cigarettes:
"A child can reasonably expect from his parents
shelter, food, clothing, filial love, religious and prac
tical education, and amusement.
"BUT I have always contended that until an off
spring has reached his majority he should dispense
with the four vices, namely, women, liquor, autos, and
tobacco, unless he can finance such projects himself."
Father must have relented, though, points out the
Daily Kansan, which reprinted the letter, for here is
the conclusion:
"(I'm sending you under separate cover one package
of Bull Durham with papers attached.) —Dad."
"Whether or not the son has learned to 'roll his own'
yet is still to be determined," adds the Kaii-saii.
