"How'd you like that, Dink?"
About the happiest Card rooter last Saturday was one Dink Templeton.
All during the afternoon Dink's many friends in the stands below and his
associates in the press box kept nodding their approval to the former Stan
ford athlete.
Seems that Dink has been spreading glowing praises for his new favorite
on the Indian squad--Bobby Bryan. He has predicted that the younger
Bryan would prove to be a mighty potent factor in the 1950 campaign. And
by the looks of things, Dink again seems to have a reliable crystal ball.
The highlight of the afternoon, of course, was when Bob ran tiirough a
herd of USFers, then headed for the sidelines, and ankled off a classy hun
dred-yard touchdown sprint. Dink turned to his guest, Adela Rogers St.
John, noted woman journalist, and sighed, "I knew he could do it. - '
Later Bryan skirted (he left Hank for his second score. Then we began to
shoot some questions at Mr. Templeton. "Nah. that's not half his best.
Wait'll he gets going." To a query about playing first string by the end of
the season, Dii k replied, "Hugasian is a pretty good man, and he'll be hard
to replace. But Bob's a great spot player. The same type as the Rupe."
That last comment proved very interesting, because there is a quite a
similarity between Bob Brysn and the former fleet Card half, Rupe Andrews.
More than that they both wear No. 11 on their jerseys. Rupe was a member
of the track team, serving as quarter-miler on the relay team. Bob is top
low hurdler and sprinter.
As far as footballing goes, comparison really gets close. Andrews, with his
great speed, was at his best on the pitchouts and end-sweeps. Often used as a
pass receiver, Rupe could get behind pass defenders and then outdistance
the secondaries for a score. His abilities were best displayed in the crucial
games of the past two years when the Cards were battling Southern Cal and
then the Bears.
Breaking into the varsity after sitting out last season with a shoulder in
jury, Bob appears ready for heavy grid duty on the Big Red Machine. Bob,
off his track performances, possesses even a little more natural speed than
the Rupe. This could be a give-away to his future usefulness.
Anyhow, it all adds up to the fact that the Dink has picked Bob Bryan for
future grid greatness. We hope he's right, because a top-flight player is
always a point-maker. Besides another first-line halfback never hurt'any
team.
Soon We'll Know the Scoop
In line with renewed hopes for an 11-game season, lots of new fealures
have been sprinkled into the usual football traditions. Rally Com, at last,
came out with an efficient display for their stunts. The book-like stand really
worked. The Indian looked good on the sidelines. The addition of the
CARDS yell and the "Big Red Machine" song from last year's Gaieties liv
ened up the root section,. Could be a sign of the future. How about hauling
out the crystal ball again. Dink?
Something New Has Been Ad<le<l
This coming weekend's clash up in Seattle should answer a lot of people's
wonderings. The Westwood Bruins tie into the U. of Washington. Both are
undefeated, and could mean trouble for the Cards. So far, UCLA has seen
no tough competition. The Huskies dumped Minnesota rather easily (28-13).
All that can be said for Minnesota is that she is Big Ten competition. That
usually is enough for a PCC member to roll over and play dead. Washing
ton didn't.
