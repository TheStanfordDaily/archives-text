# Yanks Start Vic Raschi

### 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 2 (UP)â€”
After a bedlam celebration that
threatened to put new cracks in the
Liberty Bell, the Philadelphia Phil
lies calmly digested the news today
that they will face New York Yan
kee ace Vic Raschi in the World
Series opening at Shibe Park Wed
nesday.
The kid Phillies, some of whom
woke up this morning with the first
hangovers of their young lives, did
n't think the announcement of
Raschi as starting pitcher was cause
for additional headaches.
They met in a secret session at
the park clubhouse to divide the
World Series shares they didn't
know for sure they were going tu
get until they beat Brooklyn Sun
day in the final game of the season.
Most of them knew already that
Yankee manager Casey Stengel had
switched from earlier plans and
was going with his big 21 - game
winner in the Series opener, fol
lowing with another right-hander,
Allie Reynolds, in the second game,
and switching to a southpaw, Ed
Lopat, in the third, which will be
at Yankee Stadium.
If workhorse Robin Roberts can
take it he probably will be asked
to start for Philadelphia.
