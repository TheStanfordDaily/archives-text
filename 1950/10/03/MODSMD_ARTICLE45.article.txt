# It's All the Way for Hugasian

HARRY THE HIPSTER RAMBLES for Stanford's third touchdown against the University of San
Francisco Dons. On this play, Hugasian took a handoff from guarterback Gary Kerkorian on the
24-yard line and left a wake of frantic Dons as he scooted all the way to the goal line. Trying to
halt the speeding Hipster are center Adolph Lubamersky (on the ground), tackle Bill Calhoun
(71), and guarterback Ed Brown (15). â€”Daily photo by Russ Lapham
