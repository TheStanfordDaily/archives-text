# Rally Leads to Riot

Fifteen hundred Michigan State
College students rioted through
their college town of East Lansing,
Mich., last Friday night after a
high-spirited football rally, preced
ing the Michigan game, got out of

Nine students were jailed, and
two police were injured. A student
leader managed to quell the crowd
as they threatened the jail where
the students were being held.
