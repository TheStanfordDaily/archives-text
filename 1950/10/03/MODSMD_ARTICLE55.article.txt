## 
### 
The staffs of Stanford's ROTC
units are just now getting out from
under the biggest military boom to
hit the Farm in recent history.
The current rush of draft - con
scious freshmen surpasses even the
interest shown during the touchy
fall of 1948 when Selective Service
was first revived following World
War 11.
One hundred twenty-one fresh
men have signed up for basic
courses in the Air Force ROTC this
year. Last autumn quarter 15 fresh
men joined. Total enrollment in all
Air Force ROTC classes last year

239.
Although quotas for advanced
courses in Administration and Lo
gistics are filled, the Air Force still
has openings available for qualified
veterans in Aircraft Maintenance
classes.
Major Robert O. Graham of the
Army ROTC reports an increase in
that department of more than 50 per
cent. Last year the Army ROTC
had a total of 100 students in Field
Artillery and Quartermaster
classes. Still incomplete figures put
this year's total at 242.
Nine senior veterans have taken
advantage of the opportunity to
earn a reserve Army commission
with one year of ROTC and a six
week summer camp.

proximately 43 freshmen as con
tract students. Thirty-nine more
freshman midshipmen have been'
sent to Stanford by the Navy to
prepare themselves for regular
