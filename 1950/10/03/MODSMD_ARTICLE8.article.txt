LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 2 (UP) I
—The Soviet bloc tonight unwrapped ,
a Korean peace plan calling for an
immediate cease-fire, withdrawal of I
all United Nations forces, and unob- j
served elections run jointly by the 1
present north and south govern- j
ments.
The proposal was promptly re- j
jected by American and British
spokesmen because it placed the j
northern aggressors on the same
footing as the unrecognized South
Korean government. Also listed as a j
key objection was the call for with- J
drawal of UN troops before accept- !
ance of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's i
surrender demand.
The Soviet bloc proposal would
provide for equal north and south
representation on the commission j
running the nationwide elections, and
for a UN observation group on which
Russian and the Chinese Communists j
would both be represented.
A joint assembly of the present I
north and south Korean legislatures |
would elect an "interim" committee
to run the battered country in the
transition period while a permanent j
1 government was being set up.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Y. !
Vishinsky told newsmen he saw no
possibility of a compromise between
the Communist formula and the !
West's eight-nation resolution for a
I free and unified postwar Korea.
