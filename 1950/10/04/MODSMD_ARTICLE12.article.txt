# Test Center Opens to All
## 
### 
They still answer "Veterans' Cen
ter" when you call up Stanford's new.
free counseling and testing center:
hut it's strictly a misnomer. Begin
ning July 1, the center was opened
up to all students who are interested
in taking any one of a wide variety
of vocational or educational aptitude
and interest tests.
Last year the center was open only
to veterans and was supported by
government funds. This summer
University officials decided to drop
the VA contract and make the center
available to all Stanford students
free of charge.
The switchover was made possible
by the ever-decreasing number of
veterans enrolling here.
Some 50 vocational, aptitude, inter
est, achievement, and personality
tests are now being given by the
center. Included with each test is an
interview with a graduate student
who is a specialist in guidance stud
ies. Following the test-interview, re
sults are integrated and the student
is advised as to what courses he might
most profitably take or what voca
tional field he is most suited for.
The center is located in Temporary
Building C and is headed by Acting
Director Gordon Gibb. Gibb said the
center has proven "quite successful"
so far this quarter and invited any
student to drop in.
