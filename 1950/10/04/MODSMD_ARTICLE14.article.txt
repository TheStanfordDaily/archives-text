SOUTH KOREAN forces spearheaded up the east coast to Kojin
(1), nearly 35 miles north of the 38th Parallel, and other republic
forces farther inland crossed the artificial border. United States
Marines above Seoul (2) met some stubborn resistance at Ui
jongbu, while the ROK Bth Division was held up by two Red
regiments near Checon (3). Communist China reportedly has
nearly 200,000 troops on the Manchuria-Korea border (hammer
sickle symbols) to back its threat to aid the Korean Communists
with reinforcements. Acme Telephoto
