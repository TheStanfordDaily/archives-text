## 
### BOB BATLIN 
' The time has comc to terminate j
the occupation of Japan and form a |
peace treaty," Professor George H. I
Knoles told the more than 1,000
persons at the first Tuesday Eve- ;
ning Series program last night.
Dr. Knoles, associate professor of
the Stanford History Department,
spent the summer with four other •
Farm instructors at the University :
of Tokyo this summer. He warned !
against keeping the Japanese in
rein for too long, and believed they
could now be trusted to handle
their own affairs.
Share with Japan
Saving much of his punch till the
end, Dr. Knoles told the Memorial
Auditorium audience that we must
not make the mistake of turning
our backs on Japan after the occu
pation. He repeatedly urged (hat
the United States share its intellec
tual and cultural heritage with Ja
pan, and show that "democracy is
more than a defense of the status
quo."
"The five years of occupation
have achieved considerable suc
cess," Knoles said. "The bottom fell
out of Japanese life with the defeat
in the last war."
He called attention to the need
for the complete rebuilding of Ja
pan's economy, and pointed out that
the U.S. oecunation has started that
country on the road to self-sup
port. He believed that if the econ
omy is firm.'y rebuilt, then democ
racy will have a chance to flourish
m the island empire.
Jnpnn Fast Leader
"The United States cannot hope
I to win in the current world eon
! flicts on military strength alone,"
j the professor asserted vehemently.
A reorganization of Japan's sys
tem of education and sources of in-
J formation, as has been established
| by the occupation government, is
i important if the people are to
| accent democracy, according to
Knoles. He said that Japan is the
I only nation that can supply leader
ship in the Far East.
The historian related his amaze
ment at how the Japanese and
| Americans have adjusted to the oc
: cupation situation and co-operated
| toward rebuilding Japan. He re
| cn'led that he experienced "not one
single act of hostility "
( The five Stanford professors had
j cone to Japan to educate the schol
' ars in American achievements in
i the past 15 years, but Dr. Knoles
j said he and bis comrades learned a
lot from the Japanese professors.
