Originally the cluhs expected to he
abJe to occupy the building by spring
quarter of 1951; but due to *he in
stability of construction prices in the
past few months, the University does
not expect to take bids for three or
four months. At the last spring meet
ing of the University Board of
Trustees $165,000 was appropriated
for the building.
Long-Term Lease
McPherson also outlined the plan
for setting up the financing of the
building. The cluhs will enter inlo a
33J/)-year lease with the University
and amortize the cost of the building,-,
over this period with a 5 per cent
annual interest. The seven clubs
will collect $35,000 from alumni con -
tributions to buy furniture and
kitchen equipment.
Specifications for the building,
which were drawn up entirely by
J the committee, provide for separate
| dining rooms and kitchens foi each
of the clubs, a central lounge, and
interclub offices. The site of the con-
I struction will be between the Encina
I tennis courts and the east wing of
Toyon. The entire management and
I operation of the facilities will be
! carried on by the cluhs.
Four Years of Work
: Construction of the buildins will
i culminate four years of work by th
clubs. Before the iast war three
l independent clubs — El Campo,
| Breakers, and El Toro—had scparnt.
buildings, while the four other clubs
—Los Arcos, El Cuadro-, El Capitali,
and El Tigre—each had separate din
! ing rooms in Encina Commons. A 4,
present all the clubs cat in one tour
in the Commons.
Summing up the purpose of the
eating clubs, Interclub President Lee
Kelson said, "The eating club offers
j the opportunity for men to join an
| organization which is not as tightly
knit as a fraternity, but which af
fords a social organization which
eats together, participates in intra
mural sportj, and holds many social
! activities throughout the school
' year."
