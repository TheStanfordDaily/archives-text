# Where the Money Goes
## 
### 
Tuition took a $20 climb this quarter —partly
on account of rising costs. But, academically
speaking, we're getting more for our money at
the same time.
Take a look at some of the things that have
happened. Just this summer Stanford added a
School of Architecture to her long list of major
subjects; Geography was given a separate
place on the department roster; and, of most
interest to most students, a free counseling and
testing center was opened July 1.
Counseling and testing centers are not new
to Stanford. Last year a center existed, but it
was reserved for the use of veterans and a hand
ful of non-vets who were lucky enough to gain
testing appointments.
Even then, these latter students had to pay for
the tests —insofar as the center was govern
ment supported.
This year, every Stanford student has the
opportunity of taking any one of some 50 tests
designed to help him determine what subjects
to study and what to major in. In addition, the
test-taker gets a personal interview with one
of five qualified graduate students. Everything
is absolutely free. Sixteen people have been
hired by the University to carry out the pro
gram. Many of them are "guidance men"—•

trained both in psychology and education.
Acting director of the new center is Gordon
Gibb. When asked how good the tests were as
vocational and educational indicators, Gibb
pointed out that "alone they are seldom good
forecasters of a person's interests or vocational
abilities."
But couple the tests with personal interviews,
Gibb continues, and you've got a body of com
bined results that have proven generally satis
factory to most students.
How does one go about taking the tests?
Many times, the Dean of Students or a resident
assistant in one of the campus living groups will
recommend the center to a particularly unde
cided student. But if this isn't the case, the di
rector reminded us, any person should feel free
to walk into the testing office in Temporary
Building C and arrange an appointment.
We think the counseling and testing center is
both a good idea and a profitable one to the
student body as a whole. We are told the Uni
versity instituted it because the students
wanted it —another good idea.
Above all, it is an example of just where our
money is going. And good things—at least in
the sense of the modern university —always
seem to cost money.—R.R.

factory to most students.
How does one go about taking the tests?
Many times, the Dean of Students or a resident
assistant in one of the campus living groups will
recommend the center to a particularly unde
cided student. But if this isn't the case, the di
rector reminded us, any person should feel free
to walk into the testing office in Temporary
Building C and arrange an appointment.
We think the counseling and testing center is
both a good idea and a profitable one to the
student body as a whole. We are told the Uni
versity instituted it because the students
wanted it —another good idea.
Above all, it is an example of just where our
money is going. And good things—at least in
the sense of the modern university —always
seem to cost money.—R.R.
