# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
Since the tong to which I happen to be associated
(they thought I was a football player; I thought they
were the Zeta House) doesn't serve what the cook
laughingly calls meals on Saturday night, I ambled
down the highway last weekend in search of gastric
nourishment.
I stopped in front of a neon-illuminated establish
ment called Maggie and Pinto's. It was an old stucco
building of the pie-earthquake variety, and featured
a small boy on the front stoop. The young lad was
busily engaged in swatting four-inch termites with
thp Stanford Axe (which should have been at its per
manent resting place in Berkeley) as they crawled out
the door. It was a very eye-catching scene.
Not wishing to end his pleasant activity, I leaped
gently over his tousled brown head and smilingly ab
sorbed the gentle rap of the axe against my shins.
With some difficulty I found a table inhabited by only
one person (the place wasn't crowded( it just had
one table). I seated myself qn the two-legged chair
provided l'-Jt* the comfort of the patrons.
1 noticed the chap at the table with me—he looked
like Joe Louis after the Charles fight—was eating his
soup with a butcher knife. After a period of observa
tion (I took Bio I), I overcame my natural shyness
and inquired, "What in blue-blazes (slightly expur
gated) are you doing eating your soup with a knife?"
He glanced up with his watery blue eyes and grunted,
"My fork leaks."
Right then and there I knew I was in a high-class
joint, so I hoisted my size 13 tennis shoes (I generally
wear a 9'/>, but I got a lousy roommate this quarter)
onto the table, quietly blew my nose on the red
checked table cloth, and yelled like the first touch
down for the waitress.
Oh, she was a queen! She looked like a reject from

Marquard's, but actually she turned out to be a Roble
sponsor in search of laughs and a few extra bucks.
She waltzed gaily over to my table (my companion
had gone to the men's room), looking every bit like
Bill McColl going in for six. As she placed my water
glass on the table and licked her wet finger, I noticed
that she, too, was wearing my roommate's shoes.
They were too big for her.
"We got hash," she chirped wittily.
'I'd like a menu," I retorted.
"Got menus on Friday, today we got hash."
"Ok," I surrendered (she was biting my ear), "Give
me the hash, but put some ketchup on it."
"Clean the kitchen and bleed on it," she bellowed
daintily at the Chinese cook, who was engrossed in
skinning an alley cat. 1 won't describe the meal other
than to say that the cook was a very poor cat-skinner.
They must have stolen the Duncan Hines sign from
the Phi Delt House.
After the ten-minute meal and some bit of mathe
matical agony, the snaggle-toothed waitress discovered
that I was in debt to the company to the tune of 95
cents. I gave her a buck and staggered groggily to
the door. The kid slapped me on my good shin, but I
got my laughs too, as I watched the two-hundred
pound waitress and the Chinese cook drag the scream
ing little fellow into the kitchen.
The screams stopped all of a sudden and the wait
ress appeared at the doorway gaily twirling our be
loved axe.
I got into my roommate's car and started the engine
just as a green club coupe rattled into the parking
lot. As I turned around I saw brother Vic Palmieri
leap out of the coupe and run toward the door of the
kitchen and, consequently, the waitress.
Through my rear-vision mirror, as I drove away, I
saw them embrace.
