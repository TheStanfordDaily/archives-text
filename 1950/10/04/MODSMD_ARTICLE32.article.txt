### JOY HAAS 
'1 HE YEAR OF THE OATH by George R. Stewart
in collaboration with other professors of the Uni
versity of California. Doubleday, 82, 156 pages.
Repercussions from the first book to come out of
the oath-riddled Ivory Tower reinforce the status
of faculty non-signers; however, it threatens to
shake an old cornerstone—the Board of Regents.
"Sign-or-get-out" Regent John F. Neylan has
already gone on record opposing "The Year of the
Oath" by saying it ''was obviously intended delib
erately to harm the University."
Issues that have long been stereotype headlines
arp defined in this handbook-history of the oath.
Non-signers are presented as family breadwin
ners under a strain of ideals that are difficult to
maintain when house payments fall due and
steady salary prospects dim.
The Board of Regents consists of 24 members.
Eight are ex-officio regents who hold their seats by
virtue of their incumbency in other offices. The
remaining members are appointed by the Governor
and are supposed to represent important groups
within the state.
Accoiding to the authors, the Board lias shifted
from a buffer state between faculty and outside
pressure proups. It now appears to be taking ad
vantage of its position to high-pressure the faculty
to sign an oath with the pain of dismissal from the
University as the consequence.
The hook expands six reasons behind the Re
gents' insistence on the oath:
1. A sincere belief that the University has Com
munists and that they can be gotten rid of by the
oath.
2. A pride which kept them from backing down
before faculty pressure.
3. A power drive toward controlling the Univer
sity and faculty.
4. The drive against the faculty developing into a
drive against the president of the University.
5. Politics- a letter from an AFL publication .sug
gesting that "Neylan may be trying to mess up state
institutes so Governor Warren won't show up too
well in the primary—then would play ball with the
most reactionary wing of his party."
(i. Sectionalism of the state—promoted by sup
porters of an independent UCLA.
The following reasons are listed for faculty op
position to the 34-word loyalty oath.
1. Ambiguity in text.
2. Political test—since the Communist party is le
pal in Caliiornia. the oath constitutes a political test
for faculty membership contrary to articles in the
state constitution.
3. Guilt by association—by blanket condemnation
of Communism, people were convicted because of
thpir associates, when actually they had not com

mitted an offense.
4. Persona] reasons—(a) objection to swearing to
the oath under penalty of losing livelihood; (b)
swearing one is not a Communist implies he is under
suspicion of being one; (c) implication that signer
pledged himself to traditional oath (allegiance to
government and University) in bad faith; (d) dis
crimination against professors as a group.
5. Not a good Communist preventive—true Com
munists would take the oath and laugh.
0. University welfare—most faculty members be
gan to feel that the oath was merely a means that
the Regents had of forcing their will and destroying
faculty autonomy.
7. Academic tenure—the oath opened the way for
the Regents to force their will on the faculty under
threat of dismissal.
8. Academic freedom—the oath set up a field on
which thought was no longer free.
Academic freedom is defined as the "principle in
which a teacher should be protected by the govern
ing body (regents or others) and keeps him from
losing his job if he teaches an unpopular truth.
Academic tenure means the right of a teacher,
after he has amply demonstrated his competence and
character, to hold his job, unless proved unfit. Ten
ure is not normally acquired until eight years after
receiving the Ph.D.
The reader is made to realize the fears and frus
trations that pervaded the Ivory Tower as a result
of the oath issue. For example, one teacher refused
to stale his stand on the oath over the telephone.
"It's too dangerous," he said. The wires might
he tapped.
The hook gives clues to rumors which never
saw print: how three men, discovered carrying
information directly to the Regents despite a rul
ing prohibiting such action, were known as the
"Black Triumvirate."
Stanford was hailed for her early moral and
fitiiincial support of the California faculty.
A chapter entitled "Do Regents Represent the
People?" pointed out that since 1920 the Board has
been composed mainly of financiers and business
executives. Even the "farmer" owned the largest
lemon ranch in the world and was associated with
15 corporations.
This setup creates, a gap between concentrated
wealth on one hand and faculty, student, and Uni
versity problems on the other.
"The Year of the Oath" is obviously one-sided.
But this highly readable, direct, chronological ac
count lifts a shield of Regental patriotism and makes
accusations that need answers.
Until such a time the Cal faculty must neces
sarily follow the AFL's advice, "Hang tough."
The authors stressed the fuct that they were
once ft'llilty of saying, "It can't happen here."
