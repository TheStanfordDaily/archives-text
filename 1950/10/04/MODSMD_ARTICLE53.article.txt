QUOTE OF THE WEEK: "Tulsa was a better ball team than Stanford,
und if we could play them again we'd beat them easily."—USF tackle after
Stanford's 55 to 7 win.
Dutch Fehring, Stanford assistant line coach and the Cards' Southland
(USC and UCLA) scout, isn't ready to say goodbye to the Trojans just
because they finished the lowa game six points behind. "They are going to
have a terrific ball club before the season is over. And UCLA? I think
they may have a better ball club."
The Trojans, according to Dutch, simply "hit too good a team too early."
The Trojans have traditionally been slow starters, but they have an alarm
ing habit of snowballing into something very terrible by the end of October.
Stanford plays them on November 4.
One thing that will help the Cards in their Rose Bowl quest is the attitude
of the LA newspapers in regard to the Trojan loss. The fanatical South
landers have got so excited about the lowa game that they have plumb for
gotten that Stanford has coaches, and are now raging around trying to send
Jeff Cravatii to the coaches' Fiddler's Green.
Rube Samuclsen, yesterday, quoted Sid Ziff of the Los Angeles Mirror
as saying, "Southern California doesn't have to junk its coach to win—all
it has to do is to lock him up during a game." These sentiments on the
part of the LA scribes ring very sweetly in my ears. There is no better
way of assuring a team of a poor season than to undermine the team's
confidence in their coach at the start of the season.
1 can think of no other team I would rather have undermined than good
old Jeff's big, bad Trojans.
The thing could be carried too far, however. Think of the disaster that
would hit the PCC if they should fire old Jeff, and get a football coach at
Troy.
Football season gets so uncomplicated this time of year. Now that the
Coast's Rose Bowl contenders have been boiled down to a mere five—USC,
Cal, UCLA, Washington, and (surprise) Stanford, the slap-happy scribes
can settle down to the more pertinent business of hanging themselves with
a few well-chosen words.)
Pertinent to this, I think that someone should put up a defense'for Bill
"Cal is better than ever" Leiser. There were many people at last Satur
day's USF tussle who saw fit to remind the interesting Chronicle Sports
Editor of a few «if his more glaring inaccuracies, by loud, humorous shouts
from the rooting scction.
This, I think, was unkind.
Some of the rooters had read into Mr. Leiser's pre-game stories a favo
ritism toward the Ililitoppers, and they thought he had intimated that the
Cards' running game wasn't. All right, so Mr. Leiser was mistaken. Many
people are occasionally, and just because he picked UCLA to go to the Rose
Howl yesterday, that doesn't mean he is always wrong.
I think that we on the Farm should have patience with the gentleman,
and by all means, we should cease this verbal mauling from the rooting
section. It loiiks bad for a school that has always prided itself on owning
the finest rooting scction in the world.
If you should disagree with one of the scribes, I suggest that you either
(1) forget it, (2) cancel your subscription, or (3) hit him with a stick after
the game.
Speaking of the Card rooting section, we put on a pretty poor show last
week. Oh, we were loud enough and spirited enough (with a 55 to 7 score,
why not?). But what's this business of booing the coaches' decision to kick
blooper balls on the kick-offs?
We Stanfordites have been crying for a winning football team or for
larger margins of victory for too many sordid years now. Last week we ;
got it, and the result? Boos for the strategy that helped make the victory
possible. I can remember when boos were reserved for pro baseball games
and were considered too low for a Stanford rooting section. We've come a
long way since then. I guess.
But enough of the moan, we'll turn the page of the notebook and promise
never to mention it again until the next time.
I see where the San Francisco papers have come out with all sorts of
explanations of why the Dons died so quickly and horribly at the hands of
the Injun-fellas. The Chronicle listed no less than six of these. None of
them bothered with the real reason: USF, in spite of their abundant press,
notices, was not a good football team. I suggest that they will probably lose
at least six more games this season.
And Oregon State? From the reports I could garner the Beavers are
about what they were last year, only without Carpenter. Nothing. The
Cards, overconfident though they may now be, should be able to come
back from the muggy north with another scalp. Stanford, by 21 points.
