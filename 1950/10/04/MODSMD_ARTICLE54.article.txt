### 
STOCKTON, Oct. 2 (UP) —
Threatened with a ban by the
mighty Pacific Coast Conference,
College of Pacific announced today
that it intencjs to conform with con
ference athletic eligibility rules
next year.
This means that the 15-year-old
practice of playing Stockton Col
lege sophomores with the Pacific
varsity will be stopped.
Dean Edward Betz, who dou
bles as faculty athletic adviser,
said that transfer and eligibility
rules will be amended to coni
form with conference regulations.
Betz, however, was emphatic in
stating that th« COP decision was
not forced by the conference.
Betz said that the faculty athletic
committee met Sept. 22 and decided

it was time for Pacific to come in
conformity with Coast Conference
regulations. Four clays later a letter
was sent to Victor O. Schmidt, PCC
commissioner, outlining the current
Pacific practice and asking what
steps had to be taken for conform
ity.
"This letter was not answered."
Betz charged today. "It still has
not been answered. Instead,
Schmidt sent a letter to confer
ence schools notifying them that
Pacific does not conform."
Betz said a letter now is being
prepared for Coast Conference
schools and independent teams on
the Tiger schedule. This letter will
announce Pacific's intention to
abide by PCC rules, but will ask
that they not. be made retroactive.
