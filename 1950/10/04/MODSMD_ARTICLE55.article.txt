# World Series Will Open Today
## Raschi to Take Hill for Yanks At Philadelphia 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Those vacant seats in 10, 11, and
12 o'clock classes this morning will
be to a seasonal disease, World
Series fever, which regularly hits
the Stanford campus. Farm base
ball filberts will be tuned in to the
Mutual Broadcasting System to
listen to Mel Allen and Gene Kelly
bring a pitch-by-pitch account of
the opening game of the 1950 World
Series direct from Shibe Park,
Philadelphia, starting at 10 o'clock
(PST).
Big Vic Raschi (21-9), mainstay
of the New York Yankees' pitching
staff, has received the nod from
manager Casey Stengel to open on
the mound for the Bronx Bombers.
Raschi is no newcomer to World
Series competition, having pitched
in four previous Series games in
1947 and 1949. Jim Konstanty (16-
7), ace Philadelphia relief hurler,*is
manager Eddie Sawyer's surprise
starting choice on the mound for
the Quakertown boys.
A capacity crowd of 34,000 is ex
pected to be on hand for the opener,
for which the weatherman has pre
dicted cloudy and cool.
The Yankees, who closed fast in
the red hot American League pen
nant race to nip the Detroit Tigers
and the Boston Red Sox at the wire,
have been installed as 9 to 5 favor
ites to cop the Series.
But Philadelphia's Whiz Kids,
unimpressed by the odds, are de
termined to add the World's Cham
pionship flag to the long - sought
National League pennant. The Phils
won that one the hard way, too, by
clinching the race in a thrilling 4
to 1 ten-inning battle against the
Brooklyn Dodgers on the final day
of the season.

years.
