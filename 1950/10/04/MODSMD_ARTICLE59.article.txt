## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 3 (UP) — |
Banking his big chips on a fellow |
who never before started a game I
for him. Manager Eddie Sawyer of '
the Philadelphia Phillies today
named relief pitcher Jim Konstanty
to oppose Vic Raschi of the New ;
York Yankees in tomorrow's open- I
ing game of the World Series at :
Shibe Park.
It was the most astonishing selec- j
tion of a starting pitcher since 1929, j
when in this same compact little !
North Side park Connie Mack of I
the Philadelphia Athletics picked
aged Howard Ehmke to oppose the
Chicago Cubs.
Ehmke, who was considered a
complete has-been as a big leaguer,
opened the series against the Cubs
and struck out 13 batters to set an
all-time World Series record in a
victory that started the Atheltics off
to the championship.
The selection of Konstanty added
new zest to the series, which finds
the Yankees the 13 to 5 betting fa
vorites but the kid Phillies the
widespread sentimental favorites all
over the nation.
Konstanty pitched in 74 games,
falling only one short of the all
time record of 75 established by Bill
White of the Cincinnati Red-Stock
ings back in the dark ages of base
ball. And in addition to the 16 that
he won, he must have saved three
times that many more.
Without argument, his mates pick
him as top man for most valuable
player honors in the National
League.
