# Cave of The Lost Maiden Lures Ten Farm Roughs to Mountains
## 
### PAULINE KUNZ 
At least 10 Stanford roughs know
that today's California coeds are j
merely following the example of |
their brown-skinned sisters of two j
centuries ago in the lengths to which j
they will go to make themselves at
tractive to men.
The 10 students, members of the
Stanford Cave Club, recently ex- ;
plored the Cave of the Lost Maiden j
near Shasta Lake. According to In- I
dian legend, the cave had long been j
known for the magic qualities of a !
pool in one of its most remote cham
bers.
Three Indian maidens went seeking
this pool in the hope that the waters I
would give them lasting beauty. In i
the course of their search, they came j
to a pit with sloping sides. As they I
approached the entrance, one of them
slipped on the moist rock. The others j
tried to save her, but she fell scream
ing into the darkness. They heard
her "strike and strike again, and then j
all was still."
In 1927 an expedition led by John j

C. Merriam of the Carnegie Insti
tute set out to discover whether the
legend was based on fact or whether
it was merely the product of a fertile
imagination. After three expeditions
had failed, one of the staff members,

Kodacliromcs of the Cave of the
Lost Soldier, and shots of all pre
vious caves that the club has vis
ited, will he shown tonight at 7:30
in room o(>4 of the Mineralogy
Building.

j who had remained behind to investi-
I gate fossil deposits, discovered the ;
j pit. At the bottom of the 90-foot
j shaft they found the skeleton of the
| Indian maiden, So-So-Ne.
The Stanford Cave Club, in their
! explorations of the cave during Sep
; tember of this year, used the waters
of the "magic" pool to fill their lamps j
during their subsequent mapping of
i the caverns.
The Farm group, however, has j
j done some legend-tracing of its own.;

During March of this year they suc
! ceeded in finding the Cave of the Lost
| Soldier in Sequoia National Park.
I The location, and even Ihe very ex-
I istence of this cave, has been com
pletely forgotten in the interim from
j 15)00, when the Army operated the
j park, to the present day.
The club based its search for this
I cave on the story which told of a
| soldier who slipped and fell into the
i cave as he was walking along a
| stream. When the soldier was found
! two days later, he was out of his
1 mind. A macabre twist to the story
adds that the soldier lost his gun
when he fell into the cave; after
; spending a day and a night in the
| darkness, he searched for the rifle
so as to put an end to his misery.
The Stanford group has collected
: live and fossil specimens from the
cave, photographed its formations,
i and mapped 2.200 feet of its interior.
; Sometime in the near future the Cave
! Club plans to continue its explora
j tions of the deeper recesses of the
I cave.


NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN California Cave Club members examine stalagmites and stalactites
in the Cave of the Lost Soldier in Sequoia National Park. On the left, Cliff Hopson of the Stan
ford group examines "pipe-stem" formations, while at the right, a member from the southern
California chapter looks over the unusual designs formed by the stalagmites (from the ground)
and the stalactites (from the ceiling). The passage was discovered by Bill Davis of the Stanford
grotto.
