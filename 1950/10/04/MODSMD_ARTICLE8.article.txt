# Planes Hammer At Red Convoy
## UN 55 Miles Past Border 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct 1 (UP)â€”
Communist reinforcements and sup- 1
plies rolled southward from the
Manchurian border today under a
blanket of clouds providing protec
tion from the U.S. warplanes which i
already have battered the 100-mile- j
long convoy.
American planes slashed at the
enemy column moving out of Com- |
munist China yesterday, destroying
or damaging 87 trucks and six big
guns. But low-hanging clouds over
the Japanese air bases and above
North Korea prevented the U.S.
fighters from taking off again this
morning.
UN Pushes North ,
As the Communists pushed through
reinforcements from Manchuria to
the North Korean capital of Pyong
yang, South Korean troops captured
Kosong, 55 miles inside Red Korea
along the eastern coastal highway.
The U.S. Marines' 7th Regiment
took Uijongbu, 10 miles north of
Seoul, today. The city was the scene
of the Red Koreans' first victory of
the war, more than three months ago.
Seoul Area Won
Uijongbu, which the Marines en
tered yesterday, was the last main
objective of the United Nations forces
in the Seoul area.
After they secured the city the
Marines dug in to hold against a pos
sible Red counterattack.
In a new atrocity report, Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur's headquarters
announced that the Communists
massacred an estimated 500 civilians
before withdrawing from the west
coast port of Mokpo when ROK ma
rines landed there Monday.
It was not known whether the
Communist reinforcements were
Chinese troops, but there were un
confirmed reports from Hong Kong
that the Chinese Fourth Field Army
had crossed the North Korean fron
tier from Manchuria. U.S. officers
here pointed out that there probably
are many North Koreans of military
age, who have been trained in Man
churia.
