LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 4
(UP) —The top United Nations Po
litical Committee today over
whelmingly approved a Western
blueprint for Korea's future that
would recognize the right of UN
troops to ro'l across the 2>Bth paral
lel.
The vote was 47 in favor, the five
Soviet bloc states against, and seven
abstentions.
This was far more than the two
thirds majority needed for final
General Assembly approval of its
Political Committee's preliminary
action.
The full Assembly will meet to
morrow or Friday to give its final
approval to the Korean program.
The plan calls for UN supervision
of postwar elections for the govern
ment of a free and unified Korea.
Vote on Soviet Plan
After adopting 'the eight - nation
majority proposal, the 60- nation
committee began a paragraph-by
paragraph vote on the Soviet bloc's
rival peace plan. It would call for
an immediate cease-fire and with
drawal of foreign troops as a pre
lude to nationwide elections.
The majority plan was sent to the
ful Assembly after India tried in
vain to have the committee create a
sub-group and give it until Friday
to seek a compromise between the
rival East and West formulas.
The Indian middle-road proposal
was defeated 32-24 with three ab
stentions.
India Abstains
As a result, the Indian delegation
—which has been playing an im
portant middle-road role in the Ko
rean crisis—abstained in the vote
on the majority plan. It objected
particularly to tacit authorization of
crossing the parallel. Others who
abstained were: Yugoslavia, Syria,
Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen and Saudi
Arabia.
The approved eight-nation reso
lution was originally circulated by
Britain and then sponsored also by
Australia, Brazil, Cuba, the Nether
lands, Norway, Pakistan, and the
Philippines. It was strongly backed
by the United States.
