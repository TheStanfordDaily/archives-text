# Revival film Is Prejudiced, Says NAACP
## 
### 
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, in
the first meeting of its Stanford chap
ter yesterday, denounced as "foully
biased" the film "Birth of i Nation,"
scheduled tonight as the opening of
the Stanford University Revival Se
ries.
' This film has been held respon
sible by contemporary historians for
the ri.se of the Kti Klux Klan in the
'20's," said Hank Vilas, graduate
student in the Staford Economics De
partment. He referred specifically to
faculty members of the University of
Michigan.
The NAACP was instrumental in
banning the film in New York, the
members said. As proof of its objec
tionable nature they pointed out lhat
it has also been banned in Atlanta,
Ga.
Vilas stated the Association's ob
jections as follows:
"Every Negro in the picture is por
trayed as a rape artist, intent on the
nation's ruin, and every legislature as
being full of the incompetent, cigai
smoking, stereotyped colored per
son."
Vilas refuted this picture of com
plete incompetence by mentioning
that many of the laws made in the
reconstruction period are still on the
southern statute books.
"The Ku Klux Klan is portrayed as
protector of a white supremacy
which, according to the film, is the
only moral or possible system," he
said.
Naomi Grossberg, acting chairman,
srid that the Stanford NAACP does
not object to the film's showing but
only hopes for open-mindedness in
the Stanford audience.
The group also discussed a recent
incident of restriction again: I colored
patrons in the entert tinnifnit places
around the University.
Stanford's NAACP members will
personally answer the question ; of
Bay Area high school student who
consider enrolling at Stanford. They
have had requests from nine high
schools for this service.
