(Editor's Note.â€”The value uf Stanford's foreign
student program is recognized in collegiate circles
throughout the United States. When orchids start
coming from newspapers outside the educational in
stitutions, our student body can he justly proud. The
following editorial comment came from the columns
of the San Frapcisco Chronicle, Sept. 9.)
'lite student body of Stanford University is
now in its third year of a project in the promo
tion of international understanding that de
ceives the applause of the whole community.
Six European students and one Asiatic are on
their way to the campus for a year of study.
I his will bring to 21 the total since the program
got under way. Their transportation, subsist
ence, lodging, and half their tuition is paid by
the Stanford student body; the other half of the
tuition is paid by the University. The students
thought up the idea and have followed through

on ail details ol its execution. This year's
group represents Japan, Switzerland, Austria,
Spain, Germany, France, and Finland.
We know of no better way to go about build
ing international good will and understanding.
The fact that the Stanford students are inter
ested enough to carry the financial burden is,
in itself, a demonstration whose significance
will be grasped by the visitors. It establishes
the most favorable possible climate for the
year's exposure to American customs, Ameri
can ideas, American ways of life. And it seems
haidly necessary to add that these visitors will
not only carry back to their own countries a
cleaier, warmer picture of America, but will
leave here, among their fellow students a bet
ter understanding of the commonness of the
human heritage.
