# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
I'll be banned in Palo Alto for this, but something's
jyot to be done about Roos Bros. They're a menace to
the community ... a wolf in cheap clothing. Every
one knows that William Randolph Roos was responsi
ble for starting the Spanish-American War, but lew
people today realize that it's Roos Bros, that's respon
sible for the terrific rate of juvenile delinqency in Palo
Alto.
Well, I'm out to expose them here and now (I've been
exposing people ever since I was six when I got my
name in the papers for exposing the little girl next
door . . .).
Everyone knows that the only thing dearer to a boy
than his dog and his wealthy uncle is his summer vaca
tion. It's the thought of those three glorious balmy
months that keeps a boy going through the endless
round of board meetings, Rotary luncheons, cocktail
parties . . . marble games . . . that immerses him
from September to June.
And thereby hangs a tail . . . my own, in fact.
My summer vacation ended officially on September
25th, but it began dying a slow and horrible death
about the middle of August. And that's been the case
with my summer vacations ever since I was old enough
to know the truth about night baseball.
As usual, everything went along fine through June
and July . . . with perfect beach weather—"perfect
beach weather"—that's when it's so cold she either lets
you hold her or freezes to death ... (I only lost four
this summer) . . .and lots of parties (in fact, I nearly
got invited to one) . . . Yeah, as always things were
line up to the middle of August . . . until that terrible
morning when 1 walked in to breakfast as usual
(mother can't seem to keep the porridge off the floor),
smashed father in (he head with the breadknife and

grabbed his newspaper . . . and THERE IT WAS!
That unholy Roos Bros, ad . . . "BACK TO SCHOOL."
And there staring up at me from the page was that
same little freckle-faced shn'ook with his wretched
"Buck to School" leather jacket, and his miserable
"Back to School" corduroy trousers, and his "Back to
School" books slung over his shoulder—grinning like
he was on his way to a KA smoker. It's the same kid
every year, too —either he's a midget or has hormone
trouble.
Anyway, I've been laying for him since I was six.
I used to shine shoes in front of Roos Bros, and wait
for him to come out. I never caught him, but I made
enough money to come to college.
But it's that ad that sows the first-seeds of panic in
my breast. After that I can't walk through town with
out going completely hysterical at the sight of the "Back
to School" signs in the shop windows. I can't seem to
talk to anyone without having them say, "Well, won't
be long now till you're back in school, huh?"
I feel like screaming, "Hells bells! You fool! . . .
don't you know it's only the middle of August!" But
inside I know it doesn't matter . . . my summer's shot
from then on and nothing can save it.
And I'm not the only one it happens to . . . prac
tically all the kids in the neighborhood turn into manic
depressives when that Roos Bros, ad starts appearing
. . . there's a run on the bars . . . the marriage li
cense bureaus . . . the motels.
We grow moody . . . can't eat . . . start coming
home late from the office . . . won't look at television.
It's got to stop! Somebody's got to talk to Roos Bros.
Somebody's got to tell them . . . "Please, please don't
withdraw your advertising because of what that idiot
wrote in Bull Session ..."

with my summer vacations ever since I was old enough
to know the truth about night baseball.
As usual, everything went along fine through June
and July . . . with perfect beach weather—"perfect
beach weather"—that's when it's so cold she either lets
you hold her or freezes to death ... (I only lost four
this summer) . . .and lots of parties (in fact, I nearly
got invited to one) . . . Yeah, as always things were
line up to the middle of August . . . until that terrible
morning when 1 walked in to breakfast as usual
(mother can't seem to keep the porridge off the floor),
smashed father in (he head with the breadknife and

grabbed his newspaper . . . and THERE IT WAS!
That unholy Roos Bros, ad . . . "BACK TO SCHOOL."
And there staring up at me from the page was that
same little freckle-faced shn'ook with his wretched
"Buck to School" leather jacket, and his miserable
"Back to School" corduroy trousers, and his "Back to
School" books slung over his shoulder—grinning like
he was on his way to a KA smoker. It's the same kid
every year, too —either he's a midget or has hormone
trouble.
Anyway, I've been laying for him since I was six.
I used to shine shoes in front of Roos Bros, and wait
for him to come out. I never caught him, but I made
enough money to come to college.
But it's that ad that sows the first-seeds of panic in
my breast. After that I can't walk through town with
out going completely hysterical at the sight of the "Back
to School" signs in the shop windows. I can't seem to
talk to anyone without having them say, "Well, won't
be long now till you're back in school, huh?"
I feel like screaming, "Hells bells! You fool! . . .
don't you know it's only the middle of August!" But
inside I know it doesn't matter . . . my summer's shot
from then on and nothing can save it.
And I'm not the only one it happens to . . . prac
tically all the kids in the neighborhood turn into manic
depressives when that Roos Bros, ad starts appearing
. . . there's a run on the bars . . . the marriage li
cense bureaus . . . the motels.
We grow moody . . . can't eat . . . start coming
home late from the office . . . won't look at television.
It's got to stop! Somebody's got to talk to Roos Bros.
Somebody's got to tell them . . . "Please, please don't
withdraw your advertising because of what that idiot
wrote in Bull Session ..."
I'll be banned in Palo Alto for this, but something's
jyot to be done about Roos Bros. They're a menace to
the community ... a wolf in cheap clothing. Every
one knows that William Randolph Roos was responsi
ble for starting the Spanish-American War, but lew
people today realize that it's Roos Bros, that's respon
sible for the terrific rate of juvenile delinqency in Palo
Alto.
Well, I'm out to expose them here and now (I've been
exposing people ever since I was six when I got my
name in the papers for exposing the little girl next
door . . .).
Everyone knows that the only thing dearer to a boy
than his dog and his wealthy uncle is his summer vaca
tion. It's the thought of those three glorious balmy
months that keeps a boy going through the endless
round of board meetings, Rotary luncheons, cocktail
parties . . . marble games . . . that immerses him
from September to June.
And thereby hangs a tail . . . my own, in fact.
My summer vacation ended officially on September
25th, but it began dying a slow and horrible death
about the middle of August. And that's been the case
with my summer vacations ever since I was old enough
to know the truth about night baseball.
