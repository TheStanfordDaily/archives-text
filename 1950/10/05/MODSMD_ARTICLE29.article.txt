(Ed. note: This verbatim—well,
almost verbatim—telephone con
versation took place several
months ago.)
"Hello, is this Pappy Waldorf?"
"Yes," answered a deep rumbling
voice. "Who's this?"
"This is a Stanford student."
"Who?"
"A student from Stanford."
"That's not what you said the first
time."
"Boy, I see now why it's so tough
to catch you sleeping, Mr. Waldorf."
"Hnunph." A deep one.
"Uh I'm phoning, sir, to see if
you'd like to join Marchie Schwartz
and You've heard of him?"
"Yes."
"To join Marchie and one of the
professors from the Stanford Math
ematics Department."
"What?"
"You see this professor's hobby is
statistical analysis, which he's ap
plied to games of chance. Like po
l-ei . for instance."
"Poker's a ft&me of skill," rum
bled the voice at the other end
of the line.
"Yes, sir. Well, this professor has
figured out mathematically how to
control factors of chance. He re
cently published a book on it. Now,
I've got the idea of getting you and
Marchie, two football coaches, to
gether with the professor. He says
football is as much chance as plan
and—"

"I'm quite familiar with the the
oretical approach to the sport," the
bass voice from Berkeley replied.
"Well, we thought the profes
sor and you coaches could sit be
fore a microphone and hash over
the interesting possibilities of
whether z mathematicil-statisti

cal study approach to your coach
ing methods might enable your
team to attain a higher score."
"Radio?"
"Yes, sir."
"That's silly." »
"Marchie's willing if you are —"
"Oh?"
"What do you think?"
"Well, I don't see as how we'd
settle anything, really. Sure, it
might he intellectual fun, son, but
I'm a busy man. I'm busier than
a Trojan— Excuse the language."
"But—"
"Now, look. We at Cal already
use the statistical approach, the fac
tors of chance and study of their
control. We also use movies—fast
and slow motion. We also use psy
chology— the non-Freudian school.
We've squeezed everything dry that
there is.
"Now, I don't see what I would
gain or what Marchie or that pro
fessor would gain if we just got in
front of a microphone and started
| jav/ing away. It might get too ab
j stract, besides. Anyway, I'm a very
busy man. Got to talk to some high
school seniors this afternoon."
"You're sure you won't change
your mind? The program would be
over KNBC, a 50,000-watt station."
I Hopeful pause. "It's heard in. Se
j att'e, Hawaii, and Denver . . ."
"Sorry, son. Good-bye." Click!
Moral: Two tackles in the hand
are worth a million quarterbacks
by the radio.
