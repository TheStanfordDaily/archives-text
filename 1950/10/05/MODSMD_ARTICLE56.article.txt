PPHILADELPHIA. Oct. 4 (UP)—
Maybe it looked to some folks like
1 had a .cinch out there today, but
actually I was sweating all the way
—even though it was plenty cold.
Throughout most of the game I
used my fast ball even though I
changed speeds on it occasionally.
Whenever I felt the need for it,
though, I'd throw a curve . . . but
there wasn't too much need for it.
Few people probably noticed it.
but I hurt my bad knee when I
fielded Richie Ashburn's grounder
and threw him out in the first in
ning. The knee hurt me every once
in a while but there's no point in
complainifig, especially since I won
and we got of! to a good start.
Winning the game is the most im
portant thing with me. I have al
ready been asked by some writers
whether I could pitch again on
short notice. Frankly, I hope it
isn't necessary.
