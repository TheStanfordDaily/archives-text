# Stanford Gymnast Prospects Appear to Be Best in History
## 
### 
This year's gymnast aggregation
should prove to be the best in
Stanford history, according to su
pervisor "Husky" Hunt. Besides
the holdovers from last year's team,
several promising freshmen have
made their appearance.
Led by Bob White, who is re
i puted to be able to do on the hori
zontal bars anything a monkey can
except swing by his tail, the team
will have experienced men in al
most every position. Last year
White scored in every meet includ
ing the PCC.
Perhaps the best prospect that
i Stanford has ever had in this field
|is freshman Burt Munger from
Santa Paula. Mr. Hunt used noth
! ing but superlatives in describing
| this freshman's talent. One of Mun
ger's specialties is the rope climb.
It is said that he can climb up a
I rope as fast as most other people
! can slide down one.
Freeman to Coach
Although Hunt will handle the
general supervision of the team, the
coaching duties fall upon ' Paul
Freeman, a graduate of the Univer
sity of Minnesota where he was one
of the all-time great tumblers. As
' of this date he has the largest squad
I in Stanford history with which to
j work.
The holdovers from last year's
team include Dud Kenworthy, Dick
Love, Dave Allen, James Harris,
Keith McGregor, Max Money, Jus
tin Hughes, Ted Collier, White, and
Sayler. However. Coach Freeman
is placing much of his hope in such
promising freshmen as Munger,
Nesselrod. and Walston.
Under PCC regulations freshmen
are eligible for varsity competition
in gymnastics.
In High Gear
Although the first meet will not
be until the winter quarter, prac
tice is already being shifted into
high gear. The team meets every
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
| afternoon at 5 in the gym room at
the east end of the gymnasium.
Hunt urges anyone interested to try
out for the team.
Stanford has meets with COP,
San Jose, the Olympic Club, Cali
: fornia, and Pasadena City College
this year, and will participate in the
PCC meet. The team will also give
exhibitions at various high schools
i and perform between halves at
; Stanford basketball games.
Trampoline, a new event, has
been added to the PCC agenda this
year. Hunt hopes to be able to in
duce Bruce Harlan, ex - Michigan
diving great who is presently
coaching the diving squad, to aid in
the coaching of gymnasts for this
event.

HUSKY HUNT
—"The best vet'
This year's gymnast aggregation
should prove to be the best in
Stanford history, according to su
pervisor "Husky" Hunt. Besides
the holdovers from last year's team,
several promising freshmen have
made their appearance.
Led by Bob White, who is re
i puted to be able to do on the hori
zontal bars anything a monkey can
except swing by his tail, the team
will have experienced men in al
most every position. Last year
White scored in every meet includ
ing the PCC.
Perhaps the best prospect that
i Stanford has ever had in this field
|is freshman Burt Munger from
Santa Paula. Mr. Hunt used noth
! ing but superlatives in describing
| this freshman's talent. One of Mun
ger's specialties is the rope climb.
It is said that he can climb up a
I rope as fast as most other people
! can slide down one.
Freeman to Coach
Although Hunt will handle the
general supervision of the team, the
coaching duties fall upon ' Paul
Freeman, a graduate of the Univer
sity of Minnesota where he was one
of the all-time great tumblers. As
