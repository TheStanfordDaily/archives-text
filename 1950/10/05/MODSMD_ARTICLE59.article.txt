# Yanks, Raschi Win Opener 1-0
## TWO-HIT THRILLER Phils Gamble, Lose with Konstanty; Reynolds and Roberts Slated Today 
### 
Dr. Bobby Brown of the New York Yankees, the only practicing
physician in baseball, was strictly "bad medicine" to the Phila- |
delphia Phillies yesterday as he delivered a dump double down
the left field line that produced a 1 to 0 victory in the opening
game of the World Series at Shibe Park.

Brown went on to score the only
j run that pitcher Vic Raschi needed
] to win the third straight 1 to 0
; World Series opening game in as
many years before a smaller than
expected throng of 30,746 fans.
liitiess Till Fifth
Raschi hurled a marvelous two
hitter for the prize World Series
i Ditching performance of his career.
He blocked off the Phillies without
a safe blow until Willie Jones sin
gled in the fifth, and then he got
his difficulties over in a hurry by
yielding the second blow in the
| same frame.
Before and after that, the big
pork-chops pitcher of the Yankee
staff, who is at his peak when there
is a large sack of groceries to take
home, was absolutely untouchable.
Only three Philly players man
aged to get on base. Eddie Waitkus,
j the first baseman, walked in the
! sixth and when he grounded out on
! a three-and-two pitch in the ninth,
! it was the only other time all day
that Raschi had yielded more than
two balls to a batter.
For the Phillies, it was a double
, gamble that became disastrous be
t cause Manager Eddie Sawyer not
only used up Jim Konstanty as a
starting pitcher, but he also ren
-1 dered him ineffective for the next
j day or so in his premier role as a
reliever.
One Bad Inning
Konstanty could have won with
j just a flurry of hitting support. He
had only one bad inning — the
fourth—when Brown, the newly es
tablished medico from Tulane Uni
vrsitey, led off with a double down
the left field line which third base
man Jones snatched at but couldn't
grab.
Konstanty pitched carefully to
right fielder Hank Bauer and got
him out of the way with a deep fly
to center fielder Richie Ashburn.
Brown, who had opened the in
ning with his hit, moved down to
third and it still looked as if Kon
stanty might escape without being
scored upon. But Jerry Coleman,
usually the softest 'kind of a touch
for a pitcher, whacked a fly ball to
left fielder Dick Sisler and Brown
came down after the catch to score
with ease.
That was it—the cheapest kind of
I a run that was obtainable—a hit

and two fly balls. But the Yankees,
who never fail to capitalize upon an
opportunity, made the very best of
it.
Not only did Raschi pitch the
third consecutive opening game
shutout, but he emulated Bobby
Feller of Cleveland and teammate
Allie Reynolds of the Yankees in
hurling a two-hitter. Feller pitched
his in defeat against Johnny Sain
in 1943, while Reynolds won his on
a dramatic ninth-inning home run
by Tommy Henrich last year off
Brooklyn's Don Newcombe.
Reynolds, Roberts Today
It was astonishing that the series
opener once again should have been
entirely a pitching show, but that is
what it was.
Reynolds is slated to go to the
hill for the Yanks today and is ex
pected to face Robin Roberts of the
Phils. Allie's season record was 16
and 12; Roberts won 20 while los
ing 10, his 20th victory being Sun
day's pennant-clincher at Brooklyn.

gled in the fifth, and then he got
his difficulties over in a hurry by
yielding the second blow in the
| same frame.
Before and after that, the big
pork-chops pitcher of the Yankee
staff, who is at his peak when there
is a large sack of groceries to take
home, was absolutely untouchable.
Only three Philly players man
aged to get on base. Eddie Waitkus,
j the first baseman, walked in the
! sixth and when he grounded out on
! a three-and-two pitch in the ninth,
! it was the only other time all day
that Raschi had yielded more than
two balls to a batter.
For the Phillies, it was a double
, gamble that became disastrous be
t cause Manager Eddie Sawyer not
only used up Jim Konstanty as a
starting pitcher, but he also ren
-1 dered him ineffective for the next
j day or so in his premier role as a
reliever.
One Bad Inning
Konstanty could have won with
j just a flurry of hitting support. He
had only one bad inning — the
fourth—when Brown, the newly es
tablished medico from Tulane Uni
vrsitey, led off with a double down
the left field line which third base
man Jones snatched at but couldn't
grab.
Konstanty pitched carefully to
right fielder Hank Bauer and got
him out of the way with a deep fly
to center fielder Richie Ashburn.
Brown, who had opened the in
ning with his hit, moved down to
third and it still looked as if Kon
stanty might escape without being
scored upon. But Jerry Coleman,
usually the softest 'kind of a touch
for a pitcher, whacked a fly ball to
left fielder Dick Sisler and Brown
came down after the catch to score
with ease.
That was it—the cheapest kind of
I a run that was obtainable—a hit

and two fly balls. But the Yankees,
who never fail to capitalize upon an
opportunity, made the very best of
it.
Not only did Raschi pitch the
third consecutive opening game
shutout, but he emulated Bobby
Feller of Cleveland and teammate
Allie Reynolds of the Yankees in
hurling a two-hitter. Feller pitched
his in defeat against Johnny Sain
in 1943, while Reynolds won his on
a dramatic ninth-inning home run
by Tommy Henrich last year off
Brooklyn's Don Newcombe.
Reynolds, Roberts Today
It was astonishing that the series
opener once again should have been
entirely a pitching show, but that is
what it was.
Reynolds is slated to go to the
hill for the Yanks today and is ex
pected to face Robin Roberts of the
Phils. Allie's season record was 16
and 12; Roberts won 20 while los
ing 10, his 20th victory being Sun
day's pennant-clincher at Brooklyn.

battle.
Dr. Bobby Brown of the New York Yankees, the only practicing
physician in baseball, was strictly "bad medicine" to the Phila- |
