LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4 (UP) â€”
Drill today on the UCLA campus
emphasized offense, especially pass
ing, with the red squad acting as
upcoming opponent Washington in
a dummy defensive skirmish.
Mighty Joe Marvin, apparently
completely recovered from an ankle

injury, looked his sharpest of the
season in getting of! some long
passes, and tailback Bob Moore
shorife by kicking for distance under
pressure.
