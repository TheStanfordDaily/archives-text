## Indians Prep For Beavers 
### 
Stanford football mentor Marchie -
Schwartz ran both his offensive
and defensive teams through dum
my scrimmage yesterday afternoon
in preparation for the conference
opener against Oregon State in
Corvallis Saturday.
The defensive units worked
against a reserve squad coached by
Mai Elward, who scouted OSC
against Michigan State. Elward ran
the reserves through Beaver plays
from the single wing and offset T
which is employed by Kip Taylor,
head coach at OSC.
The cold bug, which has hit over
a dozen members of the Card
squad, kept Boyd Benson out of
practice, while Harry Hugasian was
forced to leave his pads in the lock
er room.
The squad should be at full
strength Saturday with the excep
tion of Norm Manoogian, who suf
fered a strained ligament in his
knee against USF.
In a lengthy chalk talk before
practice, Schwartz announced that
the Lineman of the Week awards
for the first two games went to Co
captain Russ Pomeroy and Bill Mc-
Coll. Pomeroy won the award for
the San Jose State game by virtue
of his fierce line charge, while Mc-
Coll received the award for his ag
gressive line backing and savage
blocking in the USF game.
In a recently established Stanford
Player of the Week award, McColl
and Hugasian won the roses.
