## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 4 (UP)—
A three-run uprising in the eighth
inning was not enough to give San
Francisco and the Seals' ace hurler
Chet Johnson a victory this after
noon as Portland survived for a 4
to 3 PCL victory.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4 (UP)—
The Los Angeles Angels overcame
a seven-run deficit to defeat the
Seattle Rainiers, 9 to 8, in the first
game of a Pacific Coast League
doub!e-header; then won another
close one, 4 to 3, in the nightcap.
