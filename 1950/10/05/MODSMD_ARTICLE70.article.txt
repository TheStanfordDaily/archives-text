# 'Conqueror of Yerupaja' Returns Tells Story Of Adventures in Andes

Dave Harrah has returned to the
campus, older, thin, and tired, but
successful in his objective—a first
ascent of Yerupaja in the Peruvian
Andes.
His conquest of 21,7G9-foot Yeru
paja, "the Butcher of the Andes,"
will live in the annals of mountain
eering history as one of the great
ascents of the Western Hemisphere.
All members of the 1950 Har
vard Andean Expedition came to
feel a bone-deep hatred of the
mountain, and it was''only the
endurance and self-discipline of
the mountaineers that gave two

of them the drive needed to reach
the summit.
Harrah, who is a philosophy ma
jor, and Chuck Crush, graduate
student, joined four members of
the Harvard Expedition — George
Bell, Graham Matthews, Jim Max
well, and Austin Riggs—in Miami,
Florida, last June on their way to
| Lima, Peru.
After much red tape in the capi
tal city, the expedition gained two
i Peruvian guides, a taxidermist, and
| interpreters. This was the party
j that left for Chiquian, a day's high
way pass out of Lima.
Harrah parallels Chiquian with
Shangri-La, a lovely green river
valley cupped high in the mag-

j nificcnt liuayhuash range.
The group celebrated Inde-
I pendence Day by setting up base
camp at Lake Jahuakacha, a bird
j paradise in the shadow of the
| Huayhuash ridge.
The party spent- the next few
days in reconnaissance. They finally
chose a route up the rocky north
| shoulder of Rasac Ridge, via a sur
; vey marker left by Hans Kinzl,
! German map-maker.
Camp 2 was established in a
1 boulder field at 15,200 feet. Har
j rah and Matthews of Harvard were
i the only members of the party who
were well enough at that time to
' set up Camp 3 at 16,000 feet.
The plan of action w as to estab
lish Camp 5 near the lower south
I peak of tbe mountain and then push
to the top in pairs as the weather
| and their health permitted.
Austin Iliggs and Harrah chose
a route traversing up the west
face, which seemed to offer mini
mum technical difficulties. The
day after they left the high camp
for the last time, the same west
face began a series of surface
avalanches.
They spent two restless days and

nights waiting for the wind to quiet
down. Finally they started up at
3:30 a.m., but after 500 feet Riggs
collapsed with numbed fingers and
nausea.
George Bell joined Harrah the
next aay, and they traversed a mile
of the face before finding a natural
tent platform at 20,500 feet at the
top of a 60-degree snowslope that
dropped 3,000 feet to the glacier.
From this camp they could see
the Pacific via the Cordillera
Klanca and Iluascaran to the be
ginning of the Amazon jungles.
Ilarrah made a list of the exqui
site sky colors that ranged from
green-gold to purple.
Bell became too sick to continue,

and Jim Maxwell joined Harrah to
complete the team that made the
top.
They spent one day acclimatiz
ing, eating four cubic inches of
dried peaches, raisins, lemon drops,
and compressed cereal with sugar
and hot water. Harrah said the only
thing that kept him from going mad
from nervous tension and monotony
was the book, "The Revolt of the
Masses," that he was able to read
at this time.
Limited food supply forced the
two to start the climb the last day
of July at 10:30 a.m. Their objec
tive was lost above a fluid cloud
bank. By noon they were 1,500
feet from the summit, and by 3
p.m. they were at the base of the
summit ridge buttress.
At 5:30 Harrah and Maxwell took
turns standing on the summit, a
narrow snow projection that fell
away a sheer 4,000 feet. Harrah
said they were filled with a sense
of deep loneliness and isolation.
At that moment the ciouds rolled
away to give the pair a breathless
panoramic view of the world be
low, from a peak where no man

had stood before them.
On descent a hundred fert
down the ridge they paused for a
picture, when Harrah heard a
crack and saw the snow open be- i
tween his feet. He lunged head
downward amid snow blocks on
the way to what he momentarily i
believed to be sure death.
Suddenly he jerked to a stop in
mid-air at the end of 120 feet of
elastic nylon rope. Maxwell had
thrown himself down on the six
foot ridge and dug his ice axe into
the snow preparing for the terrific
jolt that followed when the rope
between them jerked taut.
Maxwell was unable to assist
Harrah, who claims he spent the
best years of his youth clawing
his way back up the 75-degree ice
slope.
Lacking the strength to make
high camp that night, they spent
the next 10 hours at the back of
an ice cave at 21,000 feet.
Harrah's boots were filled with
mushy snow, and he tried to thaw
his toes over a candle flame. At 10 !
a.m. they were at Camp 5, where
they brewed some hot lemonade
and relapsed into a stupor.

From there the descent was pain
ful, but they were aided by the
rest of the party who joined them
below Camp 5.
By Autf. (>, Harrah and Crush
had begun the three - day mule
and taxi trip to the Lima hospital,
where Harrah lost all his toes
from severe frost-bite. lie spent
the next five weeks recuperating
in Lima before returning to his
home in Seattle and his senior
year at Stanford.
In an account of the expedition
for a mountaineers' guide, Harrah
concluded his account thus:
"The Conqueror of Yerupaja rode
away from his mountain tied to a
cushioned saddle, tearfully grateful
for the heat of a tropical sun, and
nearly choked with joy to sec be
fore him, hour after hour, nothing
but a sky of serene blue, and ridge
after ridge of brown, brown hills."
