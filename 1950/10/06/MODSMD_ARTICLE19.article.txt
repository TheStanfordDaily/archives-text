# Two Freed At Council
## 
### 
Three traffic cases were appealed
before Men's Council last night as
the group held its first meeting of i
the fall quarter in the Excom room. |
Appeal was granted to a student
who had received a ticket for park- |
ing in a new pavement zone near I
Encina. Barricades which blocked |
off the zone had been moved aside
by unknown persons and traffic was
passing along the road previous to
the time that the student had
parked.
A new student who was ticketed j
for parking in the reserved area
near the Geology corner had his
appeal denied by the Council.
Appeal on a third parking viola
tion was granted by the Council.
