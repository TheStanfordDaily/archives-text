# Indians Invade Beavers' Land
## Cloudy Weather, Soggy Field Cut Card Odds at Corvallis 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Marchie Schwartz and his 37-strong Indian grid squad, with
Roses in their eyes and a vow on their lips, soar into the misty
Northland this morning to settle a 28-year-old score.
Their destination is water-soaked Bell Field at Corvallis, where
a Stanford team hasn't won a football game since way back in 1922.

Their vow, of course, is to shatter
Oregon State's mystic home - field
superiority which so often in the
past has doused the Pasadena gleam
in Indian eyes.
Cloudy skies and mudf'y lurf
are predicted by the weatherman
for tomorrow's conference open
er for both teams. And while he
could be wrong about Ihc cloudy
skies, the muddy field is almost a
certainty; fev Corvallis has been
receiving a merciless dousing
from the elements all week long,
and the rain has lon.-r since soaked
deep ;nlo the Bell Field pastures.

Just how the slow field will affect
the game's outcome is a debatable
issue. The oddsmakers have estab
lished the Marchiemen as two
touchdown favorites; but Schwartz,
conservative as always, objects to
this view.
The Farm headman, when inter
viewed last night, opined that the
wet weather, coupled with the fact
that the game is being played on
the Beaver home grounds, should
just about even up the odds.
In addition, the game tomorrow
celebrates Oregon State's home
coming, so the Beavers should be
right mentally for the battle.
The Staters have only one game
under their belts this season, a
.'5B to 13 pasting at the hands of
Michigan State (wo weeks ago.
They came out of that o-.v
iated, but unseathed: and, wan
two weeks to prepare for Stan
ford and the homecoming opener,
they should be at their peak.
The Taylormen operate from a
Michigan-inspired single wing, with
just enough T-formation plays to
spice their ofTense and keep the de
fense hopping.
If the Indians are to smash the
ancient jinx tomorrow, they'll have
to stop first and foremost a 175-
pound junior quarterback named
Gene Morrow. Morrow is one oi
the top passers on the Coast, a keen
signal-caller, and a dangerous safe
| ty man. If the weather allows him
| to pass, Morrow has two very ca
pable receivers in wingrnen John
1 Thomas and Don Niblett.
Other Beaver vets who will
j carry much of the load arc Cap
tain Arvid Niemi, 205 pounds of
speedy tackle; halfback Gene,
Taft, who hopes to make the
| home folks forget about Ken Car
penter; and the Clark brothers,
Jim and Herm, the mainstays of
the right side of the Orange line
at guard and tackle respectively.
Stanford, after two lopsided win
at home, will invade the Beaver
i camp less the services of only jne
player, guard Norm Mnnoogian.
| The sophomore lineman suffered a
knee injury against USF last Sat
| urday and will be replaced by ei
: ther Ted Taylor or Don Lucas. Oth
erwise, Schwartz's starting lineup
will be the same as the one which
opened against the Dons.
The Stanford squad will depart
from Mills Field at 9 a.m. in their
chartered airliner. They'll be ho
teled in Salem, 30 miles from Cor
vallis, where they'll work out thi ;
afternoon on the local high school
field.
Completing the trip complement,
in addition to the 37 players and
j three coaches, were the team doc
i tor, team trainer, and two mana
gers.

Marchie Schwartz and his 37-strong Indian grid squad, with
Roses in their eyes and a vow on their lips, soar into the misty
Northland this morning to settle a 28-year-old score.
Their destination is water-soaked Bell Field at Corvallis, where
a Stanford team hasn't won a football game since way back in 1922.

Their vow, of course, is to shatter
Oregon State's mystic home - field
superiority which so often in the
past has doused the Pasadena gleam
in Indian eyes.
Cloudy skies and mudf'y lurf
are predicted by the weatherman
for tomorrow's conference open
er for both teams. And while he
could be wrong about Ihc cloudy
skies, the muddy field is almost a
certainty; fev Corvallis has been
receiving a merciless dousing
from the elements all week long,
and the rain has lon.-r since soaked
deep ;nlo the Bell Field pastures.

Just how the slow field will affect
the game's outcome is a debatable
issue. The oddsmakers have estab
lished the Marchiemen as two
touchdown favorites; but Schwartz,
conservative as always, objects to
this view.
The Farm headman, when inter
viewed last night, opined that the
wet weather, coupled with the fact
that the game is being played on
the Beaver home grounds, should
just about even up the odds.
In addition, the game tomorrow
celebrates Oregon State's home
coming, so the Beavers should be
right mentally for the battle.
The Staters have only one game
under their belts this season, a
.'5B to 13 pasting at the hands of
Michigan State (wo weeks ago.
They came out of that o-.v
iated, but unseathed: and, wan
two weeks to prepare for Stan
ford and the homecoming opener,
they should be at their peak.
The Taylormen operate from a
Michigan-inspired single wing, with
just enough T-formation plays to
spice their ofTense and keep the de
fense hopping.
If the Indians are to smash the
ancient jinx tomorrow, they'll have
to stop first and foremost a 175-
pound junior quarterback named
Gene Morrow. Morrow is one oi
the top passers on the Coast, a keen
signal-caller, and a dangerous safe
| ty man. If the weather allows him
| to pass, Morrow has two very ca
pable receivers in wingrnen John
1 Thomas and Don Niblett.
Other Beaver vets who will
j carry much of the load arc Cap
tain Arvid Niemi, 205 pounds of
speedy tackle; halfback Gene,
Taft, who hopes to make the
| home folks forget about Ken Car
penter; and the Clark brothers,
Jim and Herm, the mainstays of
the right side of the Orange line
at guard and tackle respectively.
Stanford, after two lopsided win
at home, will invade the Beaver
i camp less the services of only jne
player, guard Norm Mnnoogian.
