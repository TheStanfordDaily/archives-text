# You Can Ring the Freedom Bell
## 
### 
This weekend Stanlord students have a
chance to help pull the rope which will ring
the Freedom Bell symbol of the Crusade for
1 'reedom.
The bell is not one which clangs cross com
munities, or elates, or continents; it is a bell
which is destined to ring around the world—
in teams of truth, individual liberty, and na
tional independence.
Locuily students can sign the Freedom Scroll,
placed in front of the Cellar, and add some
i wins too, if they feel the desire.
However, in something like a Crusade for
I'lcedcrn, coins are only pebbles in a guarry.
It ifi the moral backing, the desire for discusson
ai.d education among all peoples that is the
;.:ound measuring stick.
American leaders, since the beginning of
the international crisis, have realized the need
fci an education of truth to fight the vicious
propaganda of the Soviet regime.
TJie Crusade for Freedom, led by Eisenhow
fi:., l arleys, and Crews, is an attempt to give
I/uiope n look at itself over the radio network.
Since July 4, Radio Free Europe has broadcast
ihe truth behind the Iron Curtain. Its mission
t.\ to augment the Voice of America.
The broadcasts tell the captive peoples the
truth about what is going on in their own
countries, things their puppet governments are
ahuid to talk about.
The cry for "freedom talks" has come from
the Communist-terrorized peoples of Europe.

In answer to this cry, the Crusade for Free
dom, launched on Labor Day, is pointing toward
a goal of moral backing and financial support
from the American public.
Colleges and universities have an important
role as the leading exponents of education in
democratic America. The Stanford Foreign
Scholarship program brings the Crusade for
Freedom even closer to our hearts.
Klaus Vollmer, the ASSU-sponsored student
from the Free University of Berlin, will tell you
how he and his friends had to fight off Red
demonstrators with clubs when the Commu
nists tried to damage the university's buildings.
Klaus knows the value of education in bring
ing true freedom to his people—and people just
like thom throughout the world.
Drew Pearson and oher columnists have la
beled the Crusade for Freedom as only a means
for political ends. For our money, any leader
who can put over a program which will edu
cate the world in the ideals of freedom deserves
political support.
We believe the words on the scroll sound a
sincere note for the new freedom bell. Here
they are:
"I believe in the sacredness and dignity oi
the individual.
"1 believe that all men derive their right to
freedom ec/ually from God.
"1 pledge to resist aggression and tyranny
wherever they appear on earth."

We believe the words on the scroll sound a
sincere note for the new freedom bell. Here
they are:
"I believe in the sacredness and dignity oi
the individual.
"1 believe that all men derive their right to
freedom ec/ually from God.
"1 pledge to resist aggression and tyranny
wherever they appear on earth."
This weekend Stanlord students have a
chance to help pull the rope which will ring
the Freedom Bell symbol of the Crusade for
1 'reedom.
The bell is not one which clangs cross com
munities, or elates, or continents; it is a bell
which is destined to ring around the world—
in teams of truth, individual liberty, and na
tional independence.
Locuily students can sign the Freedom Scroll,
placed in front of the Cellar, and add some
i wins too, if they feel the desire.
However, in something like a Crusade for
I'lcedcrn, coins are only pebbles in a guarry.
It ifi the moral backing, the desire for discusson
ai.d education among all peoples that is the
;.:ound measuring stick.
American leaders, since the beginning of
the international crisis, have realized the need
fci an education of truth to fight the vicious
propaganda of the Soviet regime.
TJie Crusade for Freedom, led by Eisenhow
fi:., l arleys, and Crews, is an attempt to give
I/uiope n look at itself over the radio network.
Since July 4, Radio Free Europe has broadcast
ihe truth behind the Iron Curtain. Its mission
t.\ to augment the Voice of America.
The broadcasts tell the captive peoples the
truth about what is going on in their own
countries, things their puppet governments are
ahuid to talk about.
The cry for "freedom talks" has come from
the Communist-terrorized peoples of Europe.

In answer to this cry, the Crusade for Free
dom, launched on Labor Day, is pointing toward
a goal of moral backing and financial support
from the American public.
Colleges and universities have an important
role as the leading exponents of education in
democratic America. The Stanford Foreign
Scholarship program brings the Crusade for
Freedom even closer to our hearts.
Klaus Vollmer, the ASSU-sponsored student
from the Free University of Berlin, will tell you
how he and his friends had to fight off Red
demonstrators with clubs when the Commu
nists tried to damage the university's buildings.
Klaus knows the value of education in bring
ing true freedom to his people—and people just
like thom throughout the world.
Drew Pearson and oher columnists have la
beled the Crusade for Freedom as only a means
for political ends. For our money, any leader
who can put over a program which will edu
cate the world in the ideals of freedom deserves
political support.
