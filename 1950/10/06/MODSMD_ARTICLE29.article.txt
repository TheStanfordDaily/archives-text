# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
Bull Sessionists from time immemorial have each
had their own little crusade—a thought which, put into
< ffect, would greatly benefit our wonderful and be
loved University. Jawn Hall, for example, wanted the
Hoover Tower open on Sundays. Others have wanted
l eer on campus. Others have wanted a new basketball
Pavilion.
But likt 1 all great philosophers throughout the ages,
the picas','the warnings, and the stable advice of the
!>reat list of Bull Sessioners have <jone unnoticed by the
University Fathers, who have been too preoccupied in
the gathering of money to pay heed to the more im
portant and more altruistic matters.
Today I would like to launch my own crusade. A
worthy one, I assure you, but one which will like
wise he trampled over in the mad, sad rush for the
almighty dollar.
1 would like to suggest some improvements on the
Inner Quad. New roofs are not enough. First of all, I
would like to have the inscription on Memorial Church
< hanged so that the word "God" is at least the same
• i/e as that of the word ' Stanford." But this is a minor
i.hange, arid my opponents can well argue, "Just who
is this church dedicated to anyway?"
My main course of action is one from which I antici
j.. te no opposition from the students. Perhaps it may
Lr stifled by the more short-sighted faculty members,
but these 1 am gracious to say are few and far between.
The Inner Quad, you will recall, is composed of
asphalt and concrete, with the concrete forming a
lacing of sidewalk across the rectangle. It is a singu
larly hideous sight. My suggestion is that we simply
tear up the asphalt, leaving the concrete, and put in an
eii'ht-fcot-deep swimming pool, or series of swimming
pools, in the place where the asphalt now dulls the
University's great beauty.
Once having accomplished this, and filled the Quad
with clear blue water, the additional possibilities are
unlimited. We could place gondolas,' ala Venice, on
c;y< h of the four huge pools to transfer students to and
from Inner Quad classes and to the various Quad
islands.

These gondolas would lie rather picturesquely
manned hy members of the now defunct Romanic
Languages Department. The air of tile Quad could
then ring with the pleasant slapping of paddles and
the nostalgic hum of Spanish, French, and Italian
ballads.
It would be beautiful, especially at ni«*ht with a big
harvest moon reflecting yellow and blue lights off the
water.
The islands on the Quad would, of course, be covered
with clean white sand and populated with beach chairs,
blankets, lovers, and especially imported nightingales.
Picnickers, dogs, and small children would be either
barred or forced to ride continuously in a special gon
dola piloted by Professor Francis Xavier, who would
woo them with Alsatian lullabies.
Naturally, there would be some type of heating ap
paratus to keep the water at a tepid 74 degrees in the
spring and fall, while the whole thing could be frozen
during December, January, and February for ice skat
ing enthusiasts. In line with the latter, a ski jump
could be constructed against the front of the Church,
with the skiers zipping through Memorial Court and
ending up somewhere in the direction of Palo Alto.
These winter arrangements, due to the Univer
sity's tight financial condition, would have to come
gradually. But there is no reason why the pool con
struction should not start tomorrow. Nay, today!
I estimate that the total cost of this magnificent proj
ect would cost around fifteen and a half million dollars.
This is only slightly more than the United States paid
for Alaska, and would be infinitely more valuable to
the student than is Seward's Folly.
A good name for the project would be "Sterling's
Success." I wish to claim none of the fame for this
modern colossus myself.
It would be enough for me, that this plan should go
into effect. Some day, as an old grad, I will come back
and view with inner pride and joy the happy sun
burned faces of the'lndians, and tell myself, "This is
my heritage."

modern colossus myself.
It would be enough for me, that this plan should go

burned faces of the'lndians, and tell myself, "This is

Bull Sessionists from time immemorial have each
had their own little crusade—a thought which, put into
< ffect, would greatly benefit our wonderful and be
loved University. Jawn Hall, for example, wanted the
Hoover Tower open on Sundays. Others have wanted
l eer on campus. Others have wanted a new basketball
Pavilion.
But likt 1 all great philosophers throughout the ages,
the picas','the warnings, and the stable advice of the
!>reat list of Bull Sessioners have <jone unnoticed by the
University Fathers, who have been too preoccupied in
the gathering of money to pay heed to the more im
portant and more altruistic matters.
Today I would like to launch my own crusade. A
worthy one, I assure you, but one which will like
wise he trampled over in the mad, sad rush for the
almighty dollar.
1 would like to suggest some improvements on the
Inner Quad. New roofs are not enough. First of all, I
would like to have the inscription on Memorial Church
< hanged so that the word "God" is at least the same
• i/e as that of the word ' Stanford." But this is a minor
i.hange, arid my opponents can well argue, "Just who
is this church dedicated to anyway?"
My main course of action is one from which I antici
j.. te no opposition from the students. Perhaps it may
Lr stifled by the more short-sighted faculty members,
but these 1 am gracious to say are few and far between.
The Inner Quad, you will recall, is composed of
asphalt and concrete, with the concrete forming a
lacing of sidewalk across the rectangle. It is a singu
larly hideous sight. My suggestion is that we simply
tear up the asphalt, leaving the concrete, and put in an
eii'ht-fcot-deep swimming pool, or series of swimming
pools, in the place where the asphalt now dulls the
University's great beauty.
Once having accomplished this, and filled the Quad
with clear blue water, the additional possibilities are
unlimited. We could place gondolas,' ala Venice, on
c;y< h of the four huge pools to transfer students to and
from Inner Quad classes and to the various Quad
islands.

These gondolas would lie rather picturesquely
manned hy members of the now defunct Romanic
Languages Department. The air of tile Quad could
then ring with the pleasant slapping of paddles and
the nostalgic hum of Spanish, French, and Italian
ballads.
It would be beautiful, especially at ni«*ht with a big
harvest moon reflecting yellow and blue lights off the
water.
The islands on the Quad would, of course, be covered
with clean white sand and populated with beach chairs,
blankets, lovers, and especially imported nightingales.
Picnickers, dogs, and small children would be either
barred or forced to ride continuously in a special gon
dola piloted by Professor Francis Xavier, who would
woo them with Alsatian lullabies.
Naturally, there would be some type of heating ap
paratus to keep the water at a tepid 74 degrees in the
spring and fall, while the whole thing could be frozen
during December, January, and February for ice skat
ing enthusiasts. In line with the latter, a ski jump
could be constructed against the front of the Church,
with the skiers zipping through Memorial Court and
ending up somewhere in the direction of Palo Alto.
These winter arrangements, due to the Univer
sity's tight financial condition, would have to come
gradually. But there is no reason why the pool con
struction should not start tomorrow. Nay, today!
I estimate that the total cost of this magnificent proj
ect would cost around fifteen and a half million dollars.
This is only slightly more than the United States paid
for Alaska, and would be infinitely more valuable to
the student than is Seward's Folly.
A good name for the project would be "Sterling's
Success." I wish to claim none of the fame for this
modern colossus myself.
