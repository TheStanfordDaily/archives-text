# Vienna Strikes End
## 
### 
VIENNA â€” Austrian Communists
today called off their general strike
and pulled down the barricades that
had paralyzed traffic into Vienna
after the government appealed to
the Big Four ocupation powers to
help maintain order in the country.
Club - wielding Communists had
severed or blockaded most of the
road and rail outlets between the
capital and the Western zones since
dawn yesterday and seized a num
ber of public buildings. Allied traf
fic, however, was not affected by
the blockade.
The Austrian cabinet last night
accused the Russians of actively
supporting Communist lawlessness
and helping the Reds to occupy a
post office and telephone building
in the Soviet zone.
