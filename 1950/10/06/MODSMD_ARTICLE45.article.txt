# Beavers Will Play Host In Cards' First PCC Tilt
## 
### BY BOB BERNSTEIN 
Coach Kip Taylor, now in his second year as headman of the
Oregon Slate footballing Beavers, will field an almost exclusively
junior team tomorrow when the Big Orange plays host to Stan
ford's Rose-minded Indians.
Taylor's probable starting offensive eleven will feature eigh*

third-year performers, while only
two of the first-line ale seniors.
Heading the list of junior standouts
are pitching quarterback Gene Mor
row and his two favorite targets,
wingmen Don Niblett and John
Thomas.
It was this trio that put the match
to the Beavers' scoring fireworks
against Michigan State two weeks
ago. And although the Big Tenners
eventually doused the flames rather
effectively, 38 to 13, the work of these
three lads was nevertheless a source
of joy in Beaverland.
Thomas Shines
Thomas is the brightest light of end
coach Pete Elliott's power-laden
wingmen—another of the multi-PCC
wingmen being currently boomed for
Ail-American honors. He's big (G ft.
3 in.), beefy (220 pounds), and owns a
pair of huge mitts that simply love
to arrest a football from its flight.
And, if that isn't enough, consider the
fact that he was voted the outstand
ing downfield blocker on the team
last year. Oh. yes—he plays defense
too.
Niblett, at 185, is smaller and less
rugged than his running mate, but is
also blessed with sticky digits. Don
confines most of his activities to the
offensive side of the ledger, but is
used on defense occasionally.
Morrow, a near-sensation as a
sophomore last season, is expected to
blossom into Oregon State's greatest
passer of all time. He ranked as the
11th best tosser on the Coast last
year with 615 yards to his credit on
33 completions. He's a brainy one,
too, regarded by Taylor as a top
notch strategist.
Beavers May Have Sleepers
As stated, the above trio has
claimed most of the headlines to date;
but at least two other Beavers de
serve mention as possible standouts
in tomorrow's first conference battle
for both teams.
One of these, tackle Arvid Niemi,
took over the OSC captaincy after
captain-elect Stan McGuire met a
tragic death in a toboggan accident
last winter. Niemi, a 205-pounder
who is unusually fast for a tackle,
glows particularly at his offensive
duties. He's a two-year letter winner
and a sure-fire All-American, ac
cording to the Beaver press releases.
The lad who has assumed the
mighty responsibility of replacing the
legendary Ken Carpenter at halfback
is a former Taft JC star named, coin
cidentally, Gene Taft. Gene scored
one of the two TD's against Michigan
State and is a constant breakaway
threat. He's a junior, of course.
They've got a few other ball play
ers at Corvallis; but if the Indian
Pasadena Special is to be derailed to
morrow, the five mentioned above
will assume the main switchman du
ties.

Coach Kip Taylor, now in his second year as headman of the
Oregon Slate footballing Beavers, will field an almost exclusively
junior team tomorrow when the Big Orange plays host to Stan
ford's Rose-minded Indians.
Taylor's probable starting offensive eleven will feature eigh*

third-year performers, while only
two of the first-line ale seniors.
Heading the list of junior standouts
are pitching quarterback Gene Mor
row and his two favorite targets,
wingmen Don Niblett and John
Thomas.
It was this trio that put the match
to the Beavers' scoring fireworks
against Michigan State two weeks
ago. And although the Big Tenners
eventually doused the flames rather
effectively, 38 to 13, the work of these
three lads was nevertheless a source
of joy in Beaverland.
Thomas Shines
Thomas is the brightest light of end
coach Pete Elliott's power-laden
wingmen—another of the multi-PCC
wingmen being currently boomed for
Ail-American honors. He's big (G ft.
3 in.), beefy (220 pounds), and owns a
pair of huge mitts that simply love
to arrest a football from its flight.
And, if that isn't enough, consider the
fact that he was voted the outstand
ing downfield blocker on the team
last year. Oh. yes—he plays defense
too.
Niblett, at 185, is smaller and less
rugged than his running mate, but is
also blessed with sticky digits. Don
confines most of his activities to the
offensive side of the ledger, but is
used on defense occasionally.
Morrow, a near-sensation as a
sophomore last season, is expected to
blossom into Oregon State's greatest
passer of all time. He ranked as the
11th best tosser on the Coast last
year with 615 yards to his credit on
33 completions. He's a brainy one,
too, regarded by Taylor as a top
notch strategist.
Beavers May Have Sleepers
As stated, the above trio has
claimed most of the headlines to date;
but at least two other Beavers de
serve mention as possible standouts
in tomorrow's first conference battle
for both teams.
One of these, tackle Arvid Niemi,
took over the OSC captaincy after
captain-elect Stan McGuire met a
tragic death in a toboggan accident
last winter. Niemi, a 205-pounder
who is unusually fast for a tackle,
glows particularly at his offensive
duties. He's a two-year letter winner
and a sure-fire All-American, ac
cording to the Beaver press releases.
The lad who has assumed the
mighty responsibility of replacing the
legendary Ken Carpenter at halfback
is a former Taft JC star named, coin
cidentally, Gene Taft. Gene scored
one of the two TD's against Michigan
State and is a constant breakaway
threat. He's a junior, of course.
They've got a few other ball play
ers at Corvallis; but if the Indian
Pasadena Special is to be derailed to
morrow, the five mentioned above
will assume the main switchman du
ties.
