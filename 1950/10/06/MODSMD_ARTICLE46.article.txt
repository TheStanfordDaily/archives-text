# Card Yearlings Vie for Spots
## 
### 
The race for the 11 frosh football
starting positions reaches its climax
next week as the gridders prep for
the curtain raiser with Santa Clara
frosh next Saturday.
Headman Bbb Ghilotti has been
scrimmaging his men all week in an
effort to find out the best combina
tion. In Wednesday's scrum the
yearlings more than held their own
with the jayvees. Their pass pro
tection and defense was sharp, but
the Papooses were still ragged in
offensive blocking.
'ihe fight for end position seems
to be between Sam Morley, Dudley
Herschback, and John Steinberg.
Harry Fancher, another leading
candidate, is shelved with an ankle
hurt and may miss the Bronco
opener.
Sratching for the first - string
tackle slot are Santa Barbarans
Marshall Howe and Don Harcourt.
and Covina's Dick Gant. The latter
was All-CIF last year.
Sparring for the guard positions
are Jim Ward. Frank Druhan, and
Larry Webstery, while-trying for
most - likely - to - succeed at center
are Jack McKenna, Dick Steere,
and Ed Tanner. A 1 Robertson, con
sidered a f'ood prospect for middle
man duties, is out for several weeks
with mononucleasis.
Don Day, who broke for 50 yards
in the jayvee scrimmage, Pete Lar
mer, fend Bud Coon are jockeying
for I hp fullback spot. The prospects
for the all-important halfback spot
are Ron Cook, Frank Taherello, Bill
Andeijson, and Bill Schiedecker, a
convetted end. Of these, Cook, a
170 - pound scooter from Redondo
Beach, seems to be the best pros
pect for future varsity use.
Fighting for the quarterback po-

sition are Bob Garrett, Doug Col
lins, Ray Swarts, and Henry Guil
len. Garrett, a second-string Ail-
American prep selection with South
Pasadena last year, drew words of
praise from Pasadena sports editor
Rube Samuelson. Samuelson de
scribes Garrett as the best South
land plum since Glenn Davis.
Coach Ghilotti, not so exuberant,
qualifies this by saying, "He's got
a lot of potential, but still needs
work."
