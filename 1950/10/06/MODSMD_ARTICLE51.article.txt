# 28 Year OSC Hex On Block
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
When the Indians go Beaver
hunting tomorrow, they will not
only be out to win their first con
ference game but also to shatter a
jinx that Oregon State has held
over the locals for the past 28 years.
History shows that the last time
an invading Card team tripped OSC
was way back in 1922 when the In
dians, led by Dud DeGroot, won a
hard-fought 6 to 0 contest.
Since then Stanford has played
four games at Corvallis and has yet
to win. The Indians did gain a 0
to 0 tie in 1946. Meanwhile, Oregon
State has only one win and one
tie in 16 Palo Alto appearances.
Two-fold Triumph
A win tomorrow would be a two
fold triumph for the Injuns. Oregon
State would be one hurdle removed
from the Rose Bowl race, and at the
same time a mental hazard, which
has dampened invading Card
squads, would be lifted.
It seems that Oregon State's sta
dium is one of the finest in the
country—for the home team. Poor
drainage coupled with the wet
northern weather gives the Beavers
a tremendous advantage. .
An opponent from the sunny
south often meets a powerful home
inspired OSC eleven plus poor cli«
matic conditions.
The sum of these factors means
that a potentially great Card team
may be forced to put out more than
expected to win Saturday.
The most recent northern inva
sion was in 1946, when a strong
Stanford squad, headed by Lloyd
Merriman, was held to a scoreless
tie.
Indian speed was reduced to a
minimum by a damp field. Several
long marches were halted inches
from pay dirt by a big Beaver for
ward wall.
The 1941 trek also proved a dis
appointment. Headed by Frankie
Albert, a Card team fresh out of the
Rose Bowl was looking for its first
conference win. Instead they re
ceived a 10 to 0 setback which put
them out of contention for the Pas
adena affair.
Only Home Loss
The only loss Stanford has suf
fered at home against OSC was in
1947 when the Beavers scored a 13

to 7 win. This was the year in
which the Indians went down nine
times without a win.
On the brighter side is last year's
27 to 7 lackadaisical win over a
Beaver crew in Stanford Stadium.
The year 1942 saw the Indians
hang a 49 to 13 pasting, the worst
in the series history, on the hap
less orange and black men from
Corvallis.
Stanford finished the conferencc
third that year, sparked by players
Banducci, Norberg, Lindskog, Vuci
nich, and Taylor, all veterans from
the '40 Bowl squad.
The 1940 squad cinched the Rose
Bowl bid when they scored three
touchdowns in the third quarter to
"dam the Eeavers" 28 to 14.
Oregon State's big years came
from 1937 through 1939, when the
Beavers racked up three shutouts,
while gaining two wins and a score
less tie.
Briefly going back, there have
been 20 games played. Stanford has
won 14, OSC four, and two have
ended in deadlocks. The Cards have
gathered 333 points to the Beavers'
139.
There's the story. Tomorrow will
either see the OSC home game jinx
broken or it will see an Indian team
once more destined to be a runner
up in Coast circles.

"dam the Eeavers" 28 to 14.
Oregon State's big years came
from 1937 through 1939, when the
Beavers racked up three shutouts,
while gaining two wins and a score
less tie.
Briefly going back, there have
been 20 games played. Stanford has
won 14, OSC four, and two have
ended in deadlocks. The Cards have
gathered 333 points to the Beavers'
139.
There's the story. Tomorrow will
either see the OSC home game jinx
broken or it will see an Indian team
once more destined to be a runner
up in Coast circles.
When the Indians go Beaver
hunting tomorrow, they will not
only be out to win their first con
ference game but also to shatter a
jinx that Oregon State has held
over the locals for the past 28 years.
History shows that the last time
an invading Card team tripped OSC
was way back in 1922 when the In
dians, led by Dud DeGroot, won a
hard-fought 6 to 0 contest.
Since then Stanford has played
four games at Corvallis and has yet
to win. The Indians did gain a 0
to 0 tie in 1946. Meanwhile, Oregon
State has only one win and one
tie in 16 Palo Alto appearances.
Two-fold Triumph
A win tomorrow would be a two
fold triumph for the Injuns. Oregon
State would be one hurdle removed
from the Rose Bowl race, and at the
same time a mental hazard, which
has dampened invading Card
squads, would be lifted.
It seems that Oregon State's sta
dium is one of the finest in the
country—for the home team. Poor
drainage coupled with the wet
northern weather gives the Beavers
a tremendous advantage. .
An opponent from the sunny
south often meets a powerful home
inspired OSC eleven plus poor cli«
matic conditions.
The sum of these factors means
that a potentially great Card team
may be forced to put out more than
expected to win Saturday.
The most recent northern inva
sion was in 1946, when a strong
Stanford squad, headed by Lloyd
Merriman, was held to a scoreless
tie.
Indian speed was reduced to a
minimum by a damp field. Several
long marches were halted inches
from pay dirt by a big Beaver for
ward wall.
The 1941 trek also proved a dis
appointment. Headed by Frankie
Albert, a Card team fresh out of the
Rose Bowl was looking for its first
conference win. Instead they re
ceived a 10 to 0 setback which put
them out of contention for the Pas
adena affair.
Only Home Loss
The only loss Stanford has suf
fered at home against OSC was in
1947 when the Beavers scored a 13

to 7 win. This was the year in
which the Indians went down nine
times without a win.
On the brighter side is last year's
27 to 7 lackadaisical win over a
Beaver crew in Stanford Stadium.
The year 1942 saw the Indians
hang a 49 to 13 pasting, the worst
in the series history, on the hap
less orange and black men from
Corvallis.
Stanford finished the conferencc
third that year, sparked by players
Banducci, Norberg, Lindskog, Vuci
nich, and Taylor, all veterans from
the '40 Bowl squad.
The 1940 squad cinched the Rose
Bowl bid when they scored three
touchdowns in the third quarter to
"dam the Eeavers" 28 to 14.
