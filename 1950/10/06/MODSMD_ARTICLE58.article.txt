Bud McCorcl, last year's sopho
more class president, has been
stricken with malaria according to
i Palo Alto Hospital doctors. Al-
I though the test results are not final,
: the hospital is quite sure he has
contracted the disease.
Mfc Cord was sent to the hospital
yesterday after spending three days
in the Men's Rest Home. He had
been sick the week before.
Hospital authorities said McCord
may have been exposed to the dis-
I ease this summer when he stepped
