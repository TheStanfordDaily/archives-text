# Student Reaction Is Varied As Carillon Concerts Begin
## 
### 
It was strictly a case of mixed stu
dent reaction yesterday as the naif
hour Sunday carillon concert got
underway at 3 p.m.
For some, the bells, bells, BELLS,
were too much to take. One student,
perched rather disconsolately on a
table in the Main Libe lobby, re
marked:
"Sure it's a great idea—he's prob
ably one of the finest bell-ringers in
the country—but have you ever tried
to study with a constant ringing in
your ears?"
For others, the bells provided a

welcome Sunday afternoon diversion.
One graduate student made a spccial
trip to campus with his wife just to
park in front of Hoover Libe and
"listen to the carillon."
But the gripers seemed to pre
dominate. ""Remember when we
were in Encina?" one senior re
marked. "If your room faced the
tower, the reverberations used to
rattle the very window panes—and
the effect is just as bad today at
Stern, Crothers, and Toyon. I think
I 11 write a letter to the Editor of the
Daily."
