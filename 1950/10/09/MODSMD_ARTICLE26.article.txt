# 'Now Boys' Spoil Beaver Homecoming; Win Conference Opener at Corvallis
## Cards Smash 22-Year Jinx By 21-0 Count 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's gridiron warriors
shattered a 28-year-old jinx Sat
urday by turning back Oregon
State's scrappy Beavers 21 to 0
at Bell Field in Corvallis. The
last time an Indian sguad turned
the trick on the Beavers' .home
grounds was back in 1922 when
they took the Orangemen 6 to 0.
An Oregon State homecoming
crowd of lfi.ooo watched the
Cards hit pay-dirt twice in the
first period and once in the third
to get a good start in the right
direction in this year's race for
the Roses.
Old Man Weather crossed up the
experts by clearing Oregon skies
of black rain clouds that had been
drenching the state since Monday.
Coach Marchle Schwartz and his
charges had fully expected to play
in a downpour and on a muddy
field. However, Saturday morning's
sun put the Bell Field turf in near
perfect shape by game time. Only
the high humidity bothered the
Card gridders to any extent.
Stanford won the toss and elected
to receive. Harry Hugasian gath
ered in the bali on the Stanford 12-
yard line and returned 15 yards to
the 27. five plays later the T ndians
had a first down on the OSC 22,
and it looked like the rout was on.
Bobby White picked up six
more to the 1« on a trap play
up the middle. On the next play
Gary Kerkorian pitchcd out to
White running wide to the right,
hut the ball hit Bobby's helmet
and fell harmlessly to the ground.
The Cards huddled for the next
play, under the impression that the
pitchout was an incompleted for
ward pass. But alert Beaver half
back Bob Redkey pounced on the
loose ball, and OSC was given pos
session on the 20 as the pitchout
was ruled a lateral pass.
After three plays had netted the
Staters exactly nothing, Don Brad
ley dropped back into punt forma
tion. As Bradley got his kick away,
Jack Rye came charging in from his
left end post and partially deflected
the ball. The pigskin whirled craz
ily across the field to the OSC 37-
yard marker, where Bobby Whkte
picked it out of the air, cut diago
nally to his left, and raced across
the goal line.
Kerkorian kicked the conversion
with Hugasian holding to make the
scorc 7 to 0 in favor of the invading
Indians five and a half minutes
after the opening whistle.
The Beavers were held f:»r
downs again after the kickofT and
were forced to kick, llugasian
returned the kick to Stanford's
42; Boyd Benson picked up nine
yards in two cracks; and Kerko
rian took the hall for a first down
on the Beaver 47.
Benson fumbled on the next play.

but Card center Dick Abraham fell
on the ball for a four-yard gain.
Kerkorian was dumped on the mid
field stripe, attempting to pass.
Then Bill McColl shook himself
out into the open, and Kerkorian
hit him on the OSC 13 with a per
fect pitch. McColl snared the ball
and easily rambled the remaining
distance. Kerkorian again convert-

pitchout was an incompleted for
ward pass. But alert Beaver half
back Bob Redkey pounced on the
loose ball, and OSC was given pos
session on the 20 as the pitchout
was ruled a lateral pass.
After three plays had netted the
Staters exactly nothing, Don Brad
ley dropped back into punt forma
tion. As Bradley got his kick away,
Jack Rye came charging in from his
left end post and partially deflected
the ball. The pigskin whirled craz
ily across the field to the OSC 37-
yard marker, where Bobby Whkte
picked it out of the air, cut diago
nally to his left, and raced across
the goal line.
Kerkorian kicked the conversion
with Hugasian holding to make the
scorc 7 to 0 in favor of the invading
Indians five and a half minutes
after the opening whistle.
The Beavers were held f:»r
downs again after the kickofT and
were forced to kick, llugasian
returned the kick to Stanford's
42; Boyd Benson picked up nine
yards in two cracks; and Kerko

on the Beaver 47.
Benson fumbled on the next play.

but Card center Dick Abraham fell
on the ball for a four-yard gain.
Kerkorian was dumped on the mid
field stripe, attempting to pass.
Then Bill McColl shook himself
out into the open, and Kerkorian
hit him on the OSC 13 with a per

OREGON'S BEAVER
—He got the axe
Stanford's gridiron warriors
shattered a 28-year-old jinx Sat
urday by turning back Oregon
State's scrappy Beavers 21 to 0
at Bell Field in Corvallis. The
last time an Indian sguad turned
the trick on the Beavers' .home
grounds was back in 1922 when
they took the Orangemen 6 to 0.
An Oregon State homecoming
crowd of lfi.ooo watched the
Cards hit pay-dirt twice in the
first period and once in the third
to get a good start in the right
direction in this year's race for
the Roses.
Old Man Weather crossed up the
experts by clearing Oregon skies
of black rain clouds that had been
drenching the state since Monday.
Coach Marchle Schwartz and his
charges had fully expected to play
in a downpour and on a muddy
field. However, Saturday morning's
sun put the Bell Field turf in near
perfect shape by game time. Only
the high humidity bothered the
Card gridders to any extent.
Stanford won the toss and elected
to receive. Harry Hugasian gath
ered in the bali on the Stanford 12-
yard line and returned 15 yards to
the 27. five plays later the T ndians
had a first down on the OSC 22,
and it looked like the rout was on.
Bobby White picked up six
more to the 1« on a trap play
up the middle. On the next play
Gary Kerkorian pitchcd out to
White running wide to the right,
hut the ball hit Bobby's helmet
and fell harmlessly to the ground.
