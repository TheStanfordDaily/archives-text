Lust year 4,000 cars were registered on cam
pus, and with 877 new cars signed up the first
week of school, it seems likely that this year's
totui will equal or surpass 1949. But there are
not enough parking spaces around Quad for
4,000 cars.
A small lot at each of the four corners of the
Quad is reserved for professoro and physically

handicapped students. Assistants, instructors,
and off - campus students must park on the
street, behind the library, or opposite the Health
Service—if they can find space. Unfortunately
they often can't, because many campus stu
dents work on a superjet schedule —dress, grab
a cup of coffee, and get to class via automobile
in ten minutes.
There is no magic wand we can use to double
our parking area, but most of our parking prob
lems can be solved without magic by setting
the alarm ten minutes earlier and walking to
class.—A. M. L.
