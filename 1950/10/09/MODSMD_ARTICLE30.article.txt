### VIC PALMIERI 
I; ee where everyone from Louella Parsons to Andrei
Vishinsky is claiming that he originated the term,
"Now Boys." Weil, alter several long minutes of ex-

ItnsiveTesearch in the Hoover Libe I
to clear up the whole matter once ||
and lor all. ||
First of all, let me state that If
have a reputation in the History |
Iji partmerit for research second
only to that of Kathleen Winsor
. . . in fact, my file of old mid- ||
terms compares favorably with ||
Joel Kupperman's.

Thus, when this "Now Boy"
controversy arose, it was only natural that the Amer
ican Historical Society should request me to shed some
light on the matter, all respect to Miss Ranley and Mr.
Breier . . . the dirty liars.
Searching through my documents I came upon the
l« rin first in the log book of the Mayflower where it
was credited to Bennett Cerf. It seems he appeared
vitli a bottle of the Captain's favorite Port just as the
ship nudged Plymouth Kock and jumped ashore
shouting, "Now Boys, try and stop me . . .!"
Knowing, however, that he was an anthologist at
heart, I worked on, determined to discover the original
source. And sure enough, panting through the me
moirs of Marie Antoinette, I came upon a passage
where she rebuked two fresh courtiers who caught her
in her ante chamber, keeping them at arm's length
with a hatpin and saying . . . "now boys . . . now
boys . . ." (it turned out later their ante wasn't high
enough).
Still 1 wasn't satisfied, and I set out for Egypt in
search of new material (following in some degree the
suggestion of many "Daily" readers). There in Alex
andria among the shadows of the Ptolomies I burned
the midnight oil pursuing my researches (it turned out
someone switched cans on me—probably Little Lulu—
and I burned lighter fluid instead . . . which explains
what happened tb the Library of Alexandria).
Searching through King Tut's tomb I made my most
important discovery. There on the back of a Campbell
Soup;: label (it was the custom in ancient Egypt to bury
food along with the dead . . . preferably canned
goods, of course) I found an office memo from Cleo

patra's social chairman. It seems they had sent out
invitations for a great feast to honor the Roman am
bassador, Count Ciano, and were worried sick because
everyone was staying home to see Milton Berle instead
(it was a Tuesday night).
So out went tins office memo to all the state com
mittee chairmen, saying . . . "Now is the time for
all good men to come to the aid of the party. . . ."
And those who showed up were thereafter called
"Now Boys."
I always felt sorry for that poor social chairman
though. He went to all that trouble to cook up a good
party only to have Cleopatra make a complete fool of
herself when the Romans arrived.
Next I visited that famous oracle, Phil Delphi, in
the sacred grove at Shibe Park. "Phil," I said, "my
name is Vic Palmieri."
"Any relation to Vic Raschi?" he growled, reach
ing for another mouthful of popcorn.
"I just want lo know who originated the term, "Now
Boys," I begged.
By this time, however, he was back to his Sporting
News, weeping over the box scores, and all I heard him
say was . . . "All right, Lippy, look in the Dippy" . . .
(in Philadelphia nearly everybody reads the "Daily").
Now I smelled my game, and I followed the scent
across the North Sea to Italy, where I plunged into the
catacombs smack into a group of martyrs who were
huddled in a tunnel witnessing a showing of "Strom
boli" to prove their ability to undergo any hardship.
Upon giving the password—"Beat Cal," I was al
lowed to proceed to the archives of the ancient Chris
tians who had died rescuing the Big Game Banner,
and there I found it . . . Volume 115 of the Stanford
Daily . . . dated 1948.
There in that holy relic, which had been microfilmed
by St. Peter himself, was a series of stories on the 1948
championship freshman football team . . . referring to
them throughout as the "Now Boys," and written by
the suspected author of the first three books of the Old
Testament, Vic Palmieri, who now admits that he got
the idea from the guy who was then writing this col
umn, one Bill Dailey . . . who together wish to say
the hell with Miss Ranley and Mr. Breier, and all
other impostors.
Like they say in Russia . . . it's the truth that's im
portant. . . .

championship freshman football team . . . referring to
them throughout as the "Now Boys," and written by
the suspected author of the first three books of the Old
Testament, Vic Palmieri, who now admits that he got
the idea from the guy who was then writing this col
umn, one Bill Dailey . . . who together wish to say
the hell with Miss Ranley and Mr. Breier, and all
other impostors.
Like they say in Russia . . . it's the truth that's im
portant. . . .

I; ee where everyone from Louella Parsons to Andrei
Vishinsky is claiming that he originated the term,
"Now Boys." Weil, alter several long minutes of ex-

ItnsiveTesearch in the Hoover Libe I
to clear up the whole matter once ||
and lor all. ||
First of all, let me state that If
have a reputation in the History |
Iji partmerit for research second
only to that of Kathleen Winsor
. . . in fact, my file of old mid- ||
terms compares favorably with ||
Joel Kupperman's.

Thus, when this "Now Boy"
controversy arose, it was only natural that the Amer
ican Historical Society should request me to shed some
light on the matter, all respect to Miss Ranley and Mr.
Breier . . . the dirty liars.
Searching through my documents I came upon the
l« rin first in the log book of the Mayflower where it
was credited to Bennett Cerf. It seems he appeared
vitli a bottle of the Captain's favorite Port just as the
ship nudged Plymouth Kock and jumped ashore
shouting, "Now Boys, try and stop me . . .!"
Knowing, however, that he was an anthologist at
heart, I worked on, determined to discover the original
source. And sure enough, panting through the me
moirs of Marie Antoinette, I came upon a passage
where she rebuked two fresh courtiers who caught her
in her ante chamber, keeping them at arm's length
with a hatpin and saying . . . "now boys . . . now
boys . . ." (it turned out later their ante wasn't high
enough).
Still 1 wasn't satisfied, and I set out for Egypt in
search of new material (following in some degree the
suggestion of many "Daily" readers). There in Alex
andria among the shadows of the Ptolomies I burned
the midnight oil pursuing my researches (it turned out
someone switched cans on me—probably Little Lulu—
and I burned lighter fluid instead . . . which explains
what happened tb the Library of Alexandria).
Searching through King Tut's tomb I made my most
important discovery. There on the back of a Campbell
Soup;: label (it was the custom in ancient Egypt to bury
food along with the dead . . . preferably canned
goods, of course) I found an office memo from Cleo

patra's social chairman. It seems they had sent out
invitations for a great feast to honor the Roman am
bassador, Count Ciano, and were worried sick because
everyone was staying home to see Milton Berle instead
(it was a Tuesday night).
So out went tins office memo to all the state com
mittee chairmen, saying . . . "Now is the time for
all good men to come to the aid of the party. . . ."
And those who showed up were thereafter called
"Now Boys."
I always felt sorry for that poor social chairman
though. He went to all that trouble to cook up a good
party only to have Cleopatra make a complete fool of
herself when the Romans arrived.
Next I visited that famous oracle, Phil Delphi, in
the sacred grove at Shibe Park. "Phil," I said, "my
name is Vic Palmieri."
"Any relation to Vic Raschi?" he growled, reach
ing for another mouthful of popcorn.
"I just want lo know who originated the term, "Now
Boys," I begged.
By this time, however, he was back to his Sporting
News, weeping over the box scores, and all I heard him
say was . . . "All right, Lippy, look in the Dippy" . . .
(in Philadelphia nearly everybody reads the "Daily").
Now I smelled my game, and I followed the scent
across the North Sea to Italy, where I plunged into the
catacombs smack into a group of martyrs who were
huddled in a tunnel witnessing a showing of "Strom
boli" to prove their ability to undergo any hardship.
Upon giving the password—"Beat Cal," I was al
lowed to proceed to the archives of the ancient Chris
tians who had died rescuing the Big Game Banner,
and there I found it . . . Volume 115 of the Stanford
Daily . . . dated 1948.

catacombs smack into a group of martyrs who were
huddled in a tunnel witnessing a showing of "Strom
boli" to prove their ability to undergo any hardship.
Upon giving the password—"Beat Cal," I was al
lowed to proceed to the archives of the ancient Chris
tians who had died rescuing the Big Game Banner,
and there I found it . . . Volume 115 of the Stanford
Daily . . . dated 1948.
There in that holy relic, which had been microfilmed
by St. Peter himself, was a series of stories on the 1948
championship freshman football team . . . referring to
them throughout as the "Now Boys," and written by
the suspected author of the first three books of the Old
Testament, Vic Palmieri, who now admits that he got
the idea from the guy who was then writing this col
umn, one Bill Dailey . . . who together wish to say
the hell with Miss Ranley and Mr. Breier, and all
other impostors.
Like they say in Russia . . . it's the truth that's im
portant. . . .
