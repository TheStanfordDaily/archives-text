## Racial Segregation 
### 
To thr Editor:
Racial intermarriage is seldom discussed openly;
however, it is so closely related to certain modern
social problems that it cannot be ignored. I do not
propose in this letter to discuss the merits or demerits
of racial intermarriage, but rather to present it as the
mcr'oj reason for the existence of racial segregation in
certain areas of the United States.
The prevention of racial intermarriage is the chief
purpose of racial segregation. Some will argue that
iacini intermarriage is not harmful, but society gen
ially rejects it, and for the purposes of this discussion,
so must we. '
The tendency in modern thinking is that there is
on!'/ one solution to the racial problem, namely, that
racial segregation, where it exists as a fundamental
■ ocial institution, is an evil which should be eliminated.
How much more honest, though, is segregation than
private "gentlemen's agreements," restrictions, and so
forth. In a segregated society, the members of each
race know exactly their status; there is not the frus
tration of knowing what to do and what not to do, of
what would look right and what would not.
In a non-segregated society, there are frequently
riot; which arise from racial tensions. If we be real

istic, we shall recognize lliat no amount of federal leg
islation and no amount of exposition on the "brother
hood of man - ' is going to alter the thinking of the per
sons who engaged in the riot.
I do not believe that segregation, in itself, is respon
sible for hindering the progress of any racial group.
Factual evidence shows that it is not segregation which
has impoverished some of the Negroes in certain
Southern States.
I favor segregation, and I Relieve that the solution
oi the racial question does not lie in tearing down a
social structure which has lasted for many years, but
rather in making available more economic opportuni
ties through greater individual freedom and less gov
ernmental interference, in providing adequate housing
where slums now exist, and in improving and making
more efifiicent the educational system of our land.
