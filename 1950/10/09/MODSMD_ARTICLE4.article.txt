WASHINGTON — The inflation
outlook darkened today in the face
of threatened price increases, high
er wage demands by steel and rail
way unions, and Army disclosures
that it has stepped up purchase of
some key items by 500 per cent as
a result of the Korean war.
But President Truman's top eco
nomic advisers still are not ready
to recommend imposition of price
and wage controls. They hope that
forthcoming tighter credit curbs,
higher taxes, and "courageous" use
of industrial materials allocations
will check the inflationary spiral
before punitive action bccomcs
necessary.
