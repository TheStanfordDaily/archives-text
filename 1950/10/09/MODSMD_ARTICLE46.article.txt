# RUSSIAN STUDENT SPEAKS
## IIR Views Russian Problem On â€˜Danger Spots' Tonight 
### 
"Danger Spots" will focus the
first of its weekly broadcasts on the
USSR tonight at 7:30 over KZSU
with an interview of a Stanford
student from Russia, Herman Er
moleav.
Ermoleav, a native of the Rostov-
Don in southern Russia, was im
prisoned by the Germans in the last
war, while a member of the Rus
sian home guard. He escaped and
fought with the Soviet army as it
pushed westward toward Berlin.
When the Russians halted their
offensive, Ermoleav left the army
for Austria, where he attended a
university for two years. He came
to America a year ago, and is now
a member of the Stanford foreign
scholarship program.
Objecting to what he indicates
are the terrorist methods and un
workable ends of Soviet power, Er
moleav says he intends to slay out
of Russia.
His interview tonight will be the
first of eight such programs, each
of which will concentrate on a "po
tential starting point" of a possible
World War 111. Jim Jennings, ra
dio director of the lIR. will super
vise the show.
Rounding out the program, Jay

J Inwood will present predictions to
come as seen by members of the
Stanford Political Science Depart
ment, while highlights of Russia's
geographical and historical back-
I ground will be covered by Stu
| Handmaker.
