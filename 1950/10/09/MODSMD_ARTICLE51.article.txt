## 
### MARGARET STEVENS 
The Stanford YWCA, whose 710-girl membership last year
made it one of the largest women's organizations on campus, will
begin a five-day membership drive today, announced President
Shirley Hill.
The "Y" has a varied program open to girls of all races and

: creeds. Its membership last year
included girls from 24 different '
: churches—including all the major j
' branches of Christian churches as
well as other faiths.
Ine YWCA p;o:*ram ranges from
J studies of current issues such as
I health insurance, slum clearance,
I and present elections to community
service work with the Red Cross,
the Kindergarten for Blind Chil
dren, the Girl Scouts, and the Con
valescent Home. "Y" members ar
range for student - faculty dinners,
and prepare talks on subjects like
hosteling, camping, housekeeping,
j and cooking.
Just one year younger than the
University, the YWCA is now in its
| 59th year on the campus. The or
ganization has always been impor
j tant in campus life. It was the "Y,"
: for example, which initiated the
| idea — later backed by the entire
student body — of bringing foreign
students to the campus at student
body expense.
YWCA leaders point out that it
! was the "Y" which organized the
women's conference which later
evolved into the present AWS. It
was also the "Y" which spurred in
terest in and raised funds for the
| construction of the Women's Club
! house, where, on the third floor, the
1 association has its offices.
This same organization also origi
• ] nated the ideas of the Pre-Reg and
> J sponsor systems, foreign relief work
• on campus, the AWS vocational
i program, and the Student Work
| shop.
, | The YWCA program is financed
| by the dollar membership fee col
' lected from each member, while the
director's salary and all other ex
penses are paid by the Palo Alto
Comunity Youth Fund, local ver
sion of the Community Chest.
During the coming week, every
girl on campus will be personally

contacted by her respective YWCA i
representative. Off - campus girls
will be contacted by or should see
Margaret Christianson, Los Altos;
those in the Village should see Jan
ice Jaques.
