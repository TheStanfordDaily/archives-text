## Huskies, WSC Jolt Invaders 
### 
Stanford's future football oppo
nents were involved Saturday in
some of the mo&t spine - tingling
contests in PCC gridiron history,
the results of which have caused at
least one reversal in Rose Bowl
rankings.
The most significant contests on
the day's fare were played at Seat
tle, where Washington shaded UC
LA 21 to 20. and-at Pullman, where
Washington State's surprising Cou
gars battled USC to a 20 to 20 tie.
In the eyes of most Coast fans, the
Huskies have now replaced the
Floundering Herd in the sacred
circle of Bowl contenders.
Washington did it the hard way,
winning in the final two minutes
when Hugh McElhcnny plunged
over from one yard out and Jim
Rosenzweig booted his third extra
point ol the day, to the everlasting
joy of some 35,000 frenzied Husky
taris.
The Cougars, on the other hand,

weren't so happy with the Pullman
upset; for they led 20 to 0 until
three fourth - quarter USC scores,
the last one with 80 seconds re
maining, spoiled the Cougar
dreams. The Trojans were indeed
lucky; but they'll have to develop
a long way if they're to keep alive
their title hopes. Not to mention
keeping their coach.
Another mild surprise was regis
tered at San Jose, where Bob Bron
zan's Spartans downed Santa Clara
14 to 10 for their first win over the
Broncos. Santa Clara is Stanford's
next foe.
The Berkeley Bears, after giving
promi: i in the first half of winning
by a big margin, were throttled by
