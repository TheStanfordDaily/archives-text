After the kickofff the Beavers put
together a drive that carried to the
Stanford 10-yard line before Bill
McColl intercepted a pass in the
end zone to end the threat. The
'.oneest gainer of the OSC drive was
a 37-yard pass play froni Gene
Morrow to Jack Hoxie, when only
a shoestring tackle by Bobby White
on the Stanford 13 prevented Hoxie
from going all the way
Stanford threatened once attain
in the first half, moving to the
OSC 13; but a fumble at that
point upset the drive.
The Beavers came roaring back
in the second half and for a while
looked like they were going to get
right back in the ball game. They
took the kickofT on the eight and
marched to a first down on the
Stanford 34 in eight plays with
Gene Taft doing most of the ball
toting.
A seven - yard smash down the
middle carried the Staters to a sec
ond and three on the 27. The Stan
ford line dug in, and led by Russ
Pomeroy held the Beavers to only
two yards in three tries.
The alert Staters pounced on an
other Stanford fumble a short time
later on the Card 47. The Beavers
rolled to the 27 before they ran out
of steam, as Bruce Van Alstyne
,iust did get to a Bill Sheffold pass
in time to deflect it out of the arms
of an OSC receiver.
With two and a half minutes re
maining in the thircj period OSC's
Glen Kach punted from his own
30, but the ball slithered off his
foot. As a whole host of would-be
OSC tacklers converged on safety
man Bob Bryan, Van Alstyne
picked off the ball near the sideline
on the State 43 and went the dis
tance to the end zone, while most
of the Beavers were still wondering
what had become of the ball. Ker
korian once again converted to
bring the score to 21 to 0, where it
remained.
Stanford's big All-American end
candidate. Bill McColl, was without
doubt the outstanding player on the
field as he added playing safety to
his already oversized bag of tricks.
McColl was a giant thorn in the side

| of the Beavers, both offensively and
defensively, all afternoon long. Or
egon State head man Kip Taylor
stated empnatically that McColl
was the finest football player he
had seen in the past two years.
Schwartz was at a loss for an
explanation of the severe case of
fumbleitis which hit the Card
hall carriers. His hoys played
drop the football nine times, los
ing the hall on six of the occa
sions.
The Cards' only injury, in addi
tion to the normal amount of bumps
and bruises, was the reinjury of
! Gordy White's ankle.

'.oneest gainer of the OSC drive was
a 37-yard pass play froni Gene
Morrow to Jack Hoxie, when only
a shoestring tackle by Bobby White
on the Stanford 13 prevented Hoxie
from going all the way
Stanford threatened once attain
in the first half, moving to the
OSC 13; but a fumble at that
point upset the drive.
The Beavers came roaring back
in the second half and for a while
looked like they were going to get
right back in the ball game. They
took the kickofT on the eight and
marched to a first down on the
Stanford 34 in eight plays with
Gene Taft doing most of the ball
toting.
A seven - yard smash down the
middle carried the Staters to a sec
ond and three on the 27. The Stan
ford line dug in, and led by Russ
Pomeroy held the Beavers to only
two yards in three tries.
The alert Staters pounced on an
other Stanford fumble a short time
later on the Card 47. The Beavers
rolled to the 27 before they ran out
of steam, as Bruce Van Alstyne
,iust did get to a Bill Sheffold pass
in time to deflect it out of the arms
of an OSC receiver.
With two and a half minutes re
maining in the thircj period OSC's
Glen Kach punted from his own
30, but the ball slithered off his
foot. As a whole host of would-be
OSC tacklers converged on safety
man Bob Bryan, Van Alstyne
picked off the ball near the sideline
on the State 43 and went the dis
tance to the end zone, while most
of the Beavers were still wondering
what had become of the ball. Ker
korian once again converted to
bring the score to 21 to 0, where it
remained.
Stanford's big All-American end
candidate. Bill McColl, was without
doubt the outstanding player on the
field as he added playing safety to
his already oversized bag of tricks.
McColl was a giant thorn in the side

| of the Beavers, both offensively and
defensively, all afternoon long. Or
egon State head man Kip Taylor
stated empnatically that McColl
was the finest football player he
had seen in the past two years.
Schwartz was at a loss for an
explanation of the severe case of
fumbleitis which hit the Card
hall carriers. His hoys played
drop the football nine times, los
ing the hall on six of the occa
sions.
The Cards' only injury, in addi
tion to the normal amount of bumps
and bruises, was the reinjury of
! Gordy White's ankle.
