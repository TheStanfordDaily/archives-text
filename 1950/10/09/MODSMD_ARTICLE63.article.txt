FIVE UN DIVISIONS are working toward a vast enveloping
movement stretching from northwest of Seoul (1) to the Red
strong point of Wonsan (2) on the east coast. Large Red tank and
supply columns (shaded arrows) were reported moving down
from the Manchurian border toward Pyonghyang and Wonsan.
Some Red units were reported moving north and west out of
Wonsan. Unconfirmed North Korean reports said UN amphi
bious landings had been made at Kangnung (3) and Chang
jon (4). â€”Acme telephoto
