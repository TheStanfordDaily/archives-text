The Freedom Bell, now making a
tour of key American cities, shows a
laurel of peace around the top with

torch of freedom. The lower rim
bears the inscription, "That this
world, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom"—a paraphrase of

Gen. Lucius D. Clay, chairman of
(he Crusade for Freedom committee,
has predicted that "Behind the Iron
Curtain liberty-seeking men and
women will use the symbol of the
bell as the"V" symbol was used
against Nazi tyranny."
"You know that what men believe
to he true has been as important as
the truth itself in determining human
events," Gen. Clay stated in a mes
sage to university students, urging
their participation in the Freedom
Crusade. "If we are ever to achieve
a secure and lasting peace, the other
peoples of the world must know the
truth."
