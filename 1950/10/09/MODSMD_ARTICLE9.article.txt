# U.S. Starts Struggle To Strengthen UN

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y. (UP) —A momentous United Nations de
bate will open today on the revolutionary American plan to em
power the UN to deal with future aggression despite a veto.
John Foster Dulles, Republican foreign policy expert, will launch
the West's fight for the Soviet-opposed plan with a straight-punch-

•Hng speech warning that the best de
j fense against war is vigorous action
| now to strengthen the UN.
In a statement issued yesterday,
Dulles gave a preview of this coun
try's reasoning by saying:
"Adoption of these proposals will
strengthen the ability of the UN to
suppress acts of aggression. But they
will do more than that. They will
greatly discourage potential aggres
sors. They will decrease the risk of
little wars that lead to wholesale con
| flict. They are a roadblock in the
path of aggression. Through them we
will be effectively uniting for peace."
Dulles said the Korean crisis had
taught the lesson that the "UN should
not have to improvise the organiza
tion of its police power after an act
of aggression has occurred."
The American plan, sponsored
jointly with six other nations, would
call on UN members to earmark na
tional troop units for UN use. It
would empower the 60-nation Gen
eral Assembly to meet in emergency
session on 24 hours' notice if a veto
barred the Security Council from
acting against aggression.
