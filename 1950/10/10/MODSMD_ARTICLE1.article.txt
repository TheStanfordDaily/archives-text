## National Troops Opposed by Russia 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 9
(UP) â€” The United States today
urged the United Nations to apply
the lesson of Korea and adopt the
American plan to earmark national
troops that could be used to keep
peace by the veto-free General As
sembly.
Russia, adopting a more concilia
tory tone than expected, said it
found some good points in the revo
lutionary U.S. plan but opposed the
"general tendency" of the measure.
This almost certainly meant Russia
opposed the key provision that
would allow the General Assembly
to meet in 24 hours and act against
aggression if a veto paralyzed the
Security Council.
