# Excom Says Campus Group May Be Illegal
## 
### 
I The American Civil Liberties
Union, whose charter was approved
last week at the Excom meeting, may
be an illegal student organization
under the ASSU Constitution, it was
revealed late yesterday.
An investigating committee from
Excom discovered that the charter
had been signed by a number of men
who are not registered this quarter in
the University. The ASSU Consti
tution in Article 7, Section 1, provides
that "any group of registered students
which desires to function as an or
ganization" must submit its charter
for Excom approval.
The Excom members were prepar
ing yesterday to recommend that the
charter be revoked at tomorrow
night's meeting. They said that this
docs not bar the group from reapply
ing later through proper channels.
There was some feeling that the
group ''had not acted in good faith"
since they did not go through these
proper channels in bringing up their
charter on the Excom agenda for ap
proval.
The object of the Civil Liberties
Union, as stated in the charter, is "to
maintain the rights of free speech,
free press, free assemblage, and other
civil rights and to take all legitimate
I action in furtherance of such pur
poses."
The Stanford chapter of the Union
grew out of a National Students As
sociation committee which was set up
I last May after a panel discussion on
the University of California loyalty
oath controversy. The panel went on
record as opposing the oath require
ment.
KZSU IMPROVEMENTS
Toyon and Branner residents who
have hitherto been unable to hear
KZSU because of transmission dif
ficulties may now tunc in to 880
on the dial and pick up the campus
station. The transmitter systems
1 were repaired early this week.
