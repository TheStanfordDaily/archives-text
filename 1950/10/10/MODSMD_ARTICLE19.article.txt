# FIRE PREVENTION WEEK
## 'Clean Storage Spaces, Grounds Chief Marston 
### 
"Good housekeeping will eliminate fire hazards," said Stanford
University Fire Chief John Marston yesterday as the second day
of Fire Prevention Week ended.
"Cleaning out attics and storage spaces and cleaning up grounds
adjacent to buildings will do much to eliminate fires," he stated.

The purpose of Chief Marston's
campaign on the campus during Fire
Prevention Week will be to impress
on the students the chief causes of
fires and how they can be guarded
against.
He asserted that carelessness plus
man-made fire hazards were respon
sible for most fires. To careless smok
ers he attributed the major cause of
fires in buildings. Other causes arc
overloading electrical fixtures and
handling inflammables without cau
tion.
Statistics disclosed by Chief Mar
stonishowed that the per capita fire
loss at Stanford during the 1949-50
year amounted to 59.7 cents. This
compared favorably to the $4.64 per
capita average for the nation during
the same period.
Marston credited the low fire loss
to the generous support of the stu
dent body as a whole. It is still too
high though, he claimed.
Of 136 alarms turned in to the fire
department during 1949-50, 31 were
building fires, 34 grass fires, 9 auto,
6 gas and electric. 7 rubbish, 7 street,
6 smoke investigation, 18 emergency
and first aid, and 18 false alarms. The
total loss of property for the period
was valued at $5,974.79.
