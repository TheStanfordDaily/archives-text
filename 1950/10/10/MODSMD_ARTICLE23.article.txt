# Davis Cautions Ticket Violators
## 
### 
Several parking lags have been
issued by the police department,
but recipients of the tickets have
failed to report to headquarters,
Chief of Police Gordy Davis said
yesterday.
Failure to report tags within the
required time will result in the
fine being boosted from $2 to $3,
Davis warned. Recipients of tags
should report within three days of
receiving the tags.
After the lapse of three days, a
week's grace period is extended be
fore adding the delinquency charge.
