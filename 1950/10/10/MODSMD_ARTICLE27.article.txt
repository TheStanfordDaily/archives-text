Stanford has had its share of fires this year,
'ihn almost complete destruction of "Alpha
Gi'l," sending more than a dozen students to
another home, is but a small example of what
could happen to many of Stanford's old build
ings and living areas.
Fire Prevention Week got off to a smoky start
Sunday with a short-lived fire at the Delta Chi
House.
Warnings have been issued in the past, with
liitle or no precaution being taken. With open
houses, How carnivals, and fraternity parties
being planned for the fall social calendar, fire
hazards grow.
Chief among these are the very inflammable
party decorations. Regulations require that all
decorations be made fire-proof. Smoking
uround decorations only adds to the danger.
Fire Prevention Week represents a yellow
light for caution to students as they plan fo^
their day-to-day activities.

Taxi service is one of those luxuries which
becomes nearly a necessity for some dates in
the Palo Alto area.
The burden of taxi fees was not eased this
fall when all city taxis switched from zone rates
to meters —on a ruling last spring from the Palo
Alto City Council.
Briefly, the rates from Palo Alto to campus
living areas now vary from 50 to 90 cents in
comparison with a flat 50-cent rate last year.
The change was based on higher operating
costs and a desire to have what the city be
lieved would bring more equitable rates for
each rider.
The Palo Alto City Council can't directly af

fect Stanford life, but the meter provision indi
rectly hits the Stanford student, who often
needs cheap taxi service.
And by the way, it may be the same Stanford
student who is taking a taxi into Palo Alto to
buy goods from Palo Alto stores —increasing
the town's business immeasurably.

Few people realize the importance of the
chairman of the committee on foreign students'
scholarships. Last week Phil Nielsen put his
budget figures down in black and white before
Excom, along with much of the color behind
this ASSU program.
The campus owes Phil a vote of thanks for
entertaining the foreign students during the
summer and traveling with them all over the
country as a Stanford welcoming party.

We were disappointed to learn that the idea
of producing some of the "Messiah" choruses
during the summer season, was given up last
week when it was felt the Handel oratorio could
not be handled without an orchestra. Choir
and chorus director Harold Schmidt said it
would be too hard to combine rehearsals of
both the orchestral and vocal groups during
fall quarter.
The Stanford Music Department is growing,
but in our mind it v/ill not attain its full stature
until Handel's well-known "Messiah" becomes
a regular Christmas program as it was during
pre-war years.

Mother Nature seems to control one Stanford
tradition that will never be changed. The bees
are still buzzing at the Cellar.
