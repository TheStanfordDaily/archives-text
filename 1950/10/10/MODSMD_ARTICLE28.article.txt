# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
For a long time now we've heard a lot of shouting
about tradition on this campus. From your first wing
meeting in Encina to that last little get-together in
Frost Amphitheater, all you hear is "tradition." "Tra
dition is the bond that unites the Stanford Family." ,

You hear about the Doodles
Weaver Tradition, and the. No
Butts on Quad Tradition, the Lit
tle Dog on the Football Field Tra
dition, and the Never Give the
Axe Yeii Tradition.
There's the Say Hello to Every
body Tradition, the Reg Dances
Are Lousy Tradition, and the Nine
Out of Ten Girls in the State Are

Good Looking and the Tenth One Goes to Stanford
Tradition.
Nothing but people making speeches about tradi
tion, people working on Traditions Week, people work
ing to avoid Traditions Week . . . AND YET YOU
NEVER HEAR A WORD ABOUT THE GREATEST
TRADITION OF ALL!! â€ž . . the one that has made
Stanford what it is today (bankrupt) . . . the one that
has always rent Stanford Men to the front (St. Mihiel,
I wo Jima, Korea) ... the BIG (JAIME NIGHT IS
DUTCH TRADITION!!!
Being that Big Game Night is now exactly one month
away, and being that I'm a real wheel around here
(I'm the only guy that's ever been rejected by Rally
Com seven different times), I now proclaim the time
iron] October 11 to November 11 shall henceforth be
celebrated with lasting and prayer as SEGDOGD
Month . . . (She Either Goes Dutch Or Gets Ditched).
Only ry-krisp and Bach Beer shall be eaten during
1 hi period in honor of the Stanford men of yesteryear
who cave their lives to start this holy tradition.
Don't fail them, men!
I,<t's make SEGDOGD Month a success and show
the world we respect our Stanford heritage, and its
sacred traditions.
Speaking of traditions, I notice Stanford women are
taking their annual beating. Every year when school

opens and the roughs come back sleek and fat from
their green home pastures, it's the same story . . .
"geez! what spooks we got around here!"
Walk into any tong on the Row and you'll think
you've stumbled on a bunch of 4H Clubbers, the way
the conversation runs to "pigs!" But the worst are
the freshmen. They moan so loud the first few
weeks, you'd think they were trapped in a monastery.
But it always tickles an old-timer like me to hear how
their tune changes about the middle of the quarter.
About that time, of course, the malcontents are begin
ning to resemble unicorns. Their summer recollctions
don't make such good company on Saturday nights
any more, and the stock of Stanford women starts a
steady soar that lasts till June.
Of course, by the time you've been here a decade or
so nothing matters. You stand at Engineering Corner
when you're a freshman and watch them go by and
you'll swear there aren't five cute ones in the school.
Then as a sophomore, you're surprised to see quite a
few winsome little numbers go by. By the time you're
a junior 50 per cent look good to you, and when you're
a senior they all look beautiful.
Naturally though, the date situation around here
never had any terrors for me. That's because I'm the
guy all the Ruble sponsors try to get for blind dates
(they made a mistake and got me one who could set;
one night, and she's still being treated for hysteria).
I had a date with a girl who was really cute once
though. I wouldn't say she was built, but she had to
have a stack permit to walk around Quad. But I liked
her 'cause she was intelligent: in fact, she had a straight
"A" all through college (of course, she only took
classes where they graded on the curve).
Enough of this tripe . . . remember, men, you've
nothing to lose but the woman vou love . . . observe
SEGDOGD Month.
THOUGHT FOR TODAY
I've never been a Stanford Woman
I never hope to be one.
But I'll tell you anyhow,
I'd rather be than see one.
