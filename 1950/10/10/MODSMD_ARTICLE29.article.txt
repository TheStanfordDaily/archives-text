## In Answer to Donald E. Close 
### 
To Iht Editor:
Mi. Close's letter on the subject of racial segregation
is characteristic of a spineless set of attitudes which
jjievail in this day of interracial tensions—even in a
University where freedom is the very first requisite of
inquiry and research. Mr. Close and others like him
who have given up any attempt to work through the
multitudinous problems of our social milieu are
abridging the freedoms that are the very strength of
this country.
Mr. Close is to be commended, however, for making
a forthright statement of his views instead of relying
upon the insidious whispers and sly remarks that are
the means of expression of the herd in regard to this
ir.sue.
But Mr. Close might well have examined some of
the assumptions which he closes down over his mind
like iron curtains. "The prevention of racial inter
marriage is the chief purpose of racial segregation."
Mr. Close, aren't you waving a rather archaic red
flag to rationalize the fact that an economic system was
built up in the southern states which fathered in the
Ne< ro race a slave or servant class extremely valuable
to its convenience and pleasure?
The fact that the political structure of the Soith was
changed suggests that no social structure is absolute if
it makes harriers to the constructive ambitions of a
group of people. And Mr. Close, you cannot solve the
problems by those worthy aims at the end of your
letter IF YOU ACCEPT SEGREGATION AS YOUR
GUIDING PRINCIPLE!
You are in effect saying, "More economic opportuni
ties through greater individual freedom and less gov
ernmental interference (but only within the strict
limits of the Louisiana bayous or of Little Tokyo, L.A.),
in providing adequate housing where slums now exist

(but be sure the housing stays rijiht in the same place
where the slums now exist and not in the better resi
dential areas where property values would immedi
ately drop!) and in improving and making more effi
cient the educational system of our land (but let thein
keep to their own schools where there won't be any
chance of their mixing with our women!)."
Mr. Close, I favor your aims but v/ithout segregation.
My philosophy of history embraces the belief that the
greatest progress has come when men conceded to
work together in larger and more representative
groups for the solution of their mutual problems. And
I believe that the contributions of Carver, Brandeis,
Medina, Bunche, Einstein and many others support
that conviction.

marriage is the chief purpose of racial segregation."
Mr. Close, aren't you waving a rather archaic red
flag to rationalize the fact that an economic system was
built up in the southern states which fathered in the
Ne< ro race a slave or servant class extremely valuable
to its convenience and pleasure?
The fact that the political structure of the Soith was
changed suggests that no social structure is absolute if
it makes harriers to the constructive ambitions of a
group of people. And Mr. Close, you cannot solve the
problems by those worthy aims at the end of your
letter IF YOU ACCEPT SEGREGATION AS YOUR
GUIDING PRINCIPLE!
You are in effect saying, "More economic opportuni
ties through greater individual freedom and less gov
ernmental interference (but only within the strict
limits of the Louisiana bayous or of Little Tokyo, L.A.),
in providing adequate housing where slums now exist

(but be sure the housing stays rijiht in the same place
where the slums now exist and not in the better resi
dential areas where property values would immedi
ately drop!) and in improving and making more effi
cient the educational system of our land (but let thein
keep to their own schools where there won't be any
chance of their mixing with our women!)."
Mr. Close, I favor your aims but v/ithout segregation.
My philosophy of history embraces the belief that the
greatest progress has come when men conceded to
work together in larger and more representative
groups for the solution of their mutual problems. And
I believe that the contributions of Carver, Brandeis,
Medina, Bunche, Einstein and many others support
that conviction.
