# Card-Santa Clara Game Renews 36 Year Rivalry
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Come Saturday, Santa Clara's not
so bucking Broncos ride into Stan
lord Stadium to decide the mythical
Peninsula championship for the
thirty-second time.
In past years, with San State
only a second-rater, the annual vic
tor of the neighborhood battle was
crowned Peninsula champion.
Raiders Rise
Now, with the rise of San Jose
State's Golden Raiders from just a
small schedule breather to a big
time college team, the annual Pe
ninsula battle takes on new color.
As it stands now, Stanford holds
the strong advantage of coming out
on top. But of course if the Broncos
manage to throw the Injuns this
â€¢weekend the tri-duel will end in
confusion. Because of Stanford's
win over San Jose State, Stanford's
theoretical loss to the Broncos, and
the Spartans' recent decisive win
over Santa Clara, there would not
be a team that could claim the title
of Prune Belt champ.
Looking at the record, it seems
highly improbable that a Santa
Clara team defeated in three starts
is going to upset a Card team that
has three impressive wins in as
many goes.
With USF's lopsided G6 - 7 win
over Nevada Sunday and San Jose's
eurprise victory over the Broncos
the night before, the high - riding
Indians are being made to look good
by comparative scores.
Cards Lead, 1 fl to 10
In the past, with the Peninsula
duel strictly between Stanford and
Santa Clara, the Cards have won
19 contests while the Broncos have
galloped to 10 wins. Only two
games have ended in ties during the
history of the series which got un
der way back in 1914.
In the last two years the Cards
have gotten off miserable efforts
against the spirited Bronco teams.

It was just a brief year ago that
Stanford handed a tie to Santa
Clara on a silver platter by fum
bling.
Last year Stanford had an early
7-0 lead thanks to Kerkorian's
quarterback sneak from the three.
Then the fourth quarter saw a
costly Card error give the Broncos
the equalizer with Hall Haynes
leading the way.
Fumbles, Fumbles
The previous year, 1948, saw eight
Stanford fumbles and a pass de
tense which was non-existent pre
sent Santa Clara another win which
was far from earned. Three rapid
touchdowns following the intermis
sion provided the winning margin.
All Bronco scores were engineered
as a direct result of Indian miscues.
The 13 to 7 setback handed the
Indians in 1947 was just one in a
long line of defeats during a dis
astrous year.
Stanford Stadium felt .the impact
of a great offensive battle in 1946.
Stanford came out on the long end
of a 33 to 27 see-saw battle which
saw backs run with frightening
speed and power through suppos
edly strong lines.
Cards Bounce Back
In 1942, Stanford's last year of

Play in the Fall Mixed Doubles
Tournament will begin this week.
The tournament draw is posted
in both the Men's and Women's
Gym. All first - round matches
must he played by Oct. 15.
The Stanford Tennis Club will
hold a meeting today at 5 p.m. in
the lounge of the Women's Gym
to discuss plans for the autumn
quarter.

competition before the war, the
Broncos measured the Injuns 14 to
G in an early-season contest. After
three opening losses the Cards
came back to win six out of their

last seven games, including a Big
Game win.
The extended series started in
1914, when rugby was still being
played. Stanford took three out of
four rugby games.
Turning to American football, the
Cards racked up six straight wins
over the little Peninsula neighbor
to the south. During this string of
wins Stanford drubbed the Broncos
to the tune of 55 to 6 in 1923, the
largest history score. Jim Lawson,
now a San Francisco Forty-Niner
coach, and Murray Cuddeback were
sparkplugs of that memorable rout.
Four Shutouts
Through the years 1930 to '33
Stanford racked up four consecu
tive shutouts In 1933 the Brancos
weer favorites for the first time in
the series, but an inspired Red team
headed by Bobby Grayson upset the
odds and Santa Clara 7 to 0.
The years from '34 to 1941 saw
the teams evenly matched, with
Santa Clara winning four games
and Stanford three, with one game
a deadlock.
Stanford, with two losses and a
tie in the last three games against
the Broncos, will go into Saturday's
game boasting a record that doesn't
seem destined to be stopped by a
Bronco that will be riding high to
upset its neighbor.
