## 
### 
PULLMAN, Wash., Oct. 8 (UP)â€”
Coach Evashevski of Washington
State College said today his team's
lack of line reserves permitted the
Southern California team to salvage
a 20-20 tie in their football game
Saturday.
"Our first line played 57 minutes
and just had nothing left when they
went out," the Cougar coach said.
"Southern Cal had plenty of re
placements and just wore us down
in the fourth quarter."
