# Manoogian Out of Bronco, Bruin Tilts With Bad Knee
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity was treated
to its weekly cinema last night
when movies were shown of Satur
day's fumble fiesta against Oregon
State College.
The gridders, forsaking heavy
practice as is the Monday custom,
also listened to the scouting reports
of the Santa Clara-San Jose game
played Saturday night. The Broncos
were upset 14 to 10 in that one,
which somewhat dulled this Sat
urday's Stadium prospects.
Trainer Connie Jarvis stated that
the only new injury resulting from
the Corvallis contest, in addition to
a host of charley horses, is a back
muscie injury suffered bv Chuck

Essegian. The soph fullback should,
however, he ready for action Sat
urday.
As far as old injuries are con
cerned. Jarvis mixed good news
with bad On the more joyous side
of the ledger is the prediction that
Gordy White will definitely play
against the Broncos, his twisted an
kle having responded to treatment.
But Norm Manoogian. who hasn't
practiced since tearing a knee liga
ment against USF. is definitely out
of this week's action and possibly
will not be ready for UCLA the fol
lowing week. The big guard was
fitted for a leg brace hist Friday
and will receive it sometime this
week.
