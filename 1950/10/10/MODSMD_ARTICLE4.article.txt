SAIGON, French Indn - China â€”
Superior rebel Viet Minh forces,
believed to have been armed and
trained in Communist China,
smashed two French columns of
several battalions today, almost
within sight of the frontier fortress
town of Thatkhe.
A French military spokesman
said the battle was the most "vio
lent" of the four - year - old Indo-
China guerrilla war and could only
be described as a "hard reverse" for
the French. He said the French
were outnumbered 10 to 1.
