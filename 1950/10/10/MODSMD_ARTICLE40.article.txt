# Monachino, Olszewski Shine in Bear Victory
## 
### AL McCOMBS 
(Ed. note: McComhs, managing
editor of The Daily, witnessed the
Cal - Penn contest last Saturday
and covered it for The Daily.)
Two California backfield stand
outs, numbered 35 and 36 respec
tively, proved Saturday against
Penn that they will give the Cards
plenty of rough competition at Big
Game time.
They are 185-pound Jim Mona
chino, the 5-foot-10 senior package
of dynamite from Redondo Beach,
and John Olszewski, 185-pound, 5-
foot-11 sophomore from Long
Beach.
Monachino will be no surprise to
Stanford rooters who saw him in
the last Big Game. His younger
teammate, Olszewski, is just as
good, or bad. Both these hard
pounding backfield men continu
ally ripped the Penn lines to shreds
—Olszewski for an average of 8.4
yards on 16 tries, and Monachino
G.7 yards on 20 attempts at the line.
Neither was held for more than
four 'yards lost.
Pre-T Formation Score
Both Cal and Penn played a
ground game, and the final score
reminded spectators of the pre-T
formation days. What passes Penn
tried during the first half went wide
of their mark, leaving the impres
sion that the Cal backfield was
strong on pass defense.
However, the Penn throwers pen
etrated this defense network when
they returned to the field, showing
that Cal could be passed through
with relative ease.
Just how good is Cal? It's still
hard to say, since they haven't met
any tough Coast teams. However,
there is no doubt about the fact that
Cal is strong in the block and tackle
department. "Pappy" Waldorf has
always been a disciple of the hit
'em-hard school, and Ca! does just
that.
One of the key men in this field
is Les Richter, l ight guard with 225
pounds of brawn well distributed
around his G-foot-3 frame. Richter
is the McColl-Pomcroy type, and
more than once he brought a Penn
drive to a snappy halt in Cal ter
ritory.


JIM MONACHINO, California's candidate for All-American honors, slices through the Penn line
for a seven-yard gain. Bear guard Les Richter, a nominee for similar honors, is blocking Ed
Bell, the outstanding en don the field, to spring Monachino loose.

tively, proved Saturday against
Penn that they will give the Cards
plenty of rough competition at Big
Game time.
They are 185-pound Jim Mona
chino, the 5-foot-10 senior package
of dynamite from Redondo Beach,
and John Olszewski, 185-pound, 5-
foot-11 sophomore from Long
Beach.
Monachino will be no surprise to
Stanford rooters who saw him in
the last Big Game. His younger
teammate, Olszewski, is just as
good, or bad. Both these hard
pounding backfield men continu
ally ripped the Penn lines to shreds
—Olszewski for an average of 8.4
yards on 16 tries, and Monachino
G.7 yards on 20 attempts at the line.
Neither was held for more than
four 'yards lost.
Pre-T Formation Score
Both Cal and Penn played a
ground game, and the final score
reminded spectators of the pre-T
formation days. What passes Penn
tried during the first half went wide
of their mark, leaving the impres
sion that the Cal backfield was
strong on pass defense.
However, the Penn throwers pen
etrated this defense network when
they returned to the field, showing
that Cal could be passed through
with relative ease.
Just how good is Cal? It's still
hard to say, since they haven't met
any tough Coast teams. However,
there is no doubt about the fact that
Cal is strong in the block and tackle
department. "Pappy" Waldorf has
always been a disciple of the hit
'em-hard school, and Ca! does just
that.
One of the key men in this field
is Les Richter, l ight guard with 225
pounds of brawn well distributed
around his G-foot-3 frame. Richter
is the McColl-Pomcroy type, and
more than once he brought a Penn
drive to a snappy halt in Cal ter
ritory.


JIM MONACHINO, California's candidate for All-American honors, slices through the Penn line
for a seven-yard gain. Bear guard Les Richter, a nominee for similar honors, is blocking Ed
Bell, the outstanding en don the field, to spring Monachino loose.
