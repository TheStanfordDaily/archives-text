# Quarterback Problem
## 
### 
As for Cal's offense, their mair
problem is quarterbacking. Sopho

more Dick Lee and junior Brent
Ogden carried the load Saturday.
Both need experience, and both of
them put together would hardly
equal Celeri. Lee passed seven
times without success, while Ogden
connected with one out of four, the
only one Cal completed all after
noon
The Bears-travel to Troyland next
week, an undertaking which should
show if they have something big.
Their greatest feeling of security
toward the Big Game is the fact
that they play with USF on Nov. 18
while Stanford and Army bruise it
out.
