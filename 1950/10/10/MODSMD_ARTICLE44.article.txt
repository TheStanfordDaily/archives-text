# First Two Beaver Quarterbacks Out
## 
### 
Oregon State's Kip Taylor was
faced with quarterback troubles
following Saturday's 20 to 0 loss to
Stanford.
Ace junior quarterback Gene
Morrow will probably be out for
the rest of the season.
Taylor's second string quarter
back, Cub Houck, will miss this
week's contest with Washington.
Houck had an appendectomy two
weeks ago.
Gene Taft may get the nod off
his performance in the Stanford
game, where he completed three for
nine for 32 yards from his left half-
I back slot.
