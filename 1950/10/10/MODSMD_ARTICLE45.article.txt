(See photograph on page 1.)

Stanford 12, San Francisco 7
Stanford 11, Central Valley (»
Stanford 22. Presidio Turf Club 2
Stanford (», University Club
Stanford 5, Sacramento I
Led by Captain Bill Decker, the
Indian polo squad proved invincible
even when playing the highly rated
Sun Francisco polo team whose
players have a National Polo Asso
ciation rating of 11 goals.
Allen Ross, Stanford equestrian
instructor who looks after the Red
Barn for the University, coached
the Redskin willow - wallopers
throughout the season last year.
The varsity squad developed from
a team with only a limited amount
of experience last fall to a highly
developed working organization
displaying great teamwork.
Allan Seherer, the most experi
enced player on the squad, play#
ing in the key No. position, was
high scorer for the year, and un
doubtedly was a major reason for
the team's over-all success He
is the only Redskin player with a
rating from the National Polo As
sociation, and was chosen for the
West Coast all - star team which
traveled to Hawaii and won
a tournament in the Pineapple
Bowl last summer.
Without the sharpshooting of
Mickey Seeley in the No. 1 slot,

| and Lynn Madlencr's skillful mal
j let-handling as No. 2 man, Scher
er's play - developing activities
would not have been as successful.
Captain Decker's defensive playing
1 at No. 4 was also invaluable to the
| squad's efforts.
Each player was awarded with an
! individual cup and four more cups
were given alternates Bill Ross,
1 Tom Shartle, Martin Perlberger,
| and Dean Eyre.
Paul Verdier, who donated the
trophy given to the Redskins, ex
plained its history and why he do
nated it to West Coast polo circles.
"I am an old polo player my
self. he said, "and I donated the
trophy because I want polo to
become a popular sport in Cali
fornia, nut essentially a sport of
the wealthy as it is in France and
England.
"The trophy was made in London.
; England, of solid sterling silver. It
is an exact copy of the trophy given
to the winner of "The Derby" in
t England, now held by the Royal
! Scots Greys."
The names of the Redskin play
ers will be engraved on the trophy,
which will be perpetual until won
three times in succession by any
one team. The Indian polo squad
hopes the trophy will eventually
find a permanent resting place on
the Farm.
Stanford's varsity polo squad has
already played its opening game ol
I the new season in a round robin ex
hibition match against San Fran
! Cisco and the Presidio Turf Club.
It split this doubleheader in Golden
Gate Park last weekend.

order to keep alive their chances of
