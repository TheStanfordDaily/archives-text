### 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C.—Presidents
of two of the nation's top universi
ties split on the question of loyalty
oaths for professors today in
speeches before educators gathered
for the inauguration of former
Army Secretary Gordon Gray as
president of the University of North
Carolina.
"There is danger that we may . . .
sacrifice our freedom in our fight
to preserve it," warned President
1., A. Dußridgc of the California
Institute of Technology.
President George D. Stoddard of
the University of Illinois endorsed
loyalty oaths on grounds that oaths
arc required for most government
jobs and "what is asked of so many,
should not arouse suspicion in the
few."
