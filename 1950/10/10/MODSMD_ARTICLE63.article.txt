# Radio Club Admits First Woman 'Ham'
## 
### 
Stanford's Radio Club, previously
an all-male organization, last year
admitted its first woman to mem
bership. Carol Barnes, a junior
majoring in journalism, is a licensed
radio amateur, previously known to
club members only as WBETL. Her
specialty is code transmission.
The Radio Club will meet for the
first time this year tonight at 7:30
in Room 283. After the meeting,
members will hold an open house
at their station near the Ryan Lab
oratory, at which time the newly
constructed 1,0000-watt short-wave
transmitter will be demonstrated.
