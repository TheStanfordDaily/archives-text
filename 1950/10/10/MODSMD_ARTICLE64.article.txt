THE STANFORD FOOTBALL TEAM weren t the only ones who
expected rain at Corvallis Saturday. The Farm yell leaders had
also practiced all week for performance under wet skies. The
weather turned up sunny; so, not to be outdone, head yell
leader Pete Henderson showers as Jim Scott, on Dave Dorward's
shoulders, provides the rain. â€”Daily photo by Don Dapelo
