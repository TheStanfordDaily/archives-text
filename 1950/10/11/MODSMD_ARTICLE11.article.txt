# Eating Clubs Will Solicit Building Funds
## 
### 
A new plan for raising funds for
the Eating Club building was dis
cussed at an Inter-Club Council
meeting held yesterday afternoon.
Hal RosofT, Inter-Club representa
tive from El Toro, suggested the
seven individual clubs pool their ef
forts and ideas info a unified money
raising program. This would speed
achievement of the $35,000 goal they
must reach to fulfill their agreement
with the University. The University
Trustees have already appropriated
$165,000 for the building at a meeting
last June.
After passage of the motion pro
posed by RosofT, Lee Kelson, Inter-
Club Council president said, "This
move has consolidated our efforts to
raise building funds." It was stressed
that unification of fund-raising ef
forts and ideas did not mean that all
donations received would be grouped
into a single overall fund, but rather
that ideas for soliciting funds from
alumni would be exchanged.
In line with lhe program initiated
to achieve greater working coopera
tion among the clubs, Nov. 10 was
chosen as a tentative date for an all
club party. It was thought this would
encourage friendliness between indi
vidual members of the clubs.
