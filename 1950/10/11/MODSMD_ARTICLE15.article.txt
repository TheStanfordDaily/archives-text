# Oregon Game Film Slated for Tonight
## 
### 
The Cardinals will show movies
of the Stanford-Oregon State foot
ball game this evening at. 7:15. The
movies will be shown in Memorial
Auditorium instead of Cubberley
Auditorium due to the larger-than
usual attendance expected after the
played-away game.
As usual, Head Coach Marchic
Schwartz will be there to give a
play-by-play commentary on the
game.
