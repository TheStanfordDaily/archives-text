# Turnbull Praises Newton

"Isaac Newton's work in scicncc i
was one of the supreme contributions j
to world knowledge," Herbert W.
Turnbull, visiting professor from St. j
Andrews University in Edinburgh,
Scotland, told a Tuesday Evening
Scries audicncc last night.
"He lias not even been superseded
by Einstein today," Professor Turn
bull said, recounting the many phases
of the seventeenth century genius's
work. "Newton was a man in his
early twenties when he began his im
portant discoveries which led to what
is now called differential and integral
calculus. This was the razor-edged
tool by which the science of mathe
matical analysis was advanced."
Finds Newton's Scribblings
The lecturer himself has shed new 1
light on the activities of Newton |
through his scholarly research among
old letters and manuscripts. At Stan
ford yesterday, examining a sheet of
paper on which Newton had made
some notes on alchemy, Professor
rurnbul! found a marginal scribbling
vhich Newton apparently had made |

when he wits on the verge of arriving
at his theories on calculus.
"Newton was a celebrity in his day,
a dynamic public figure, even active

for a time as Warden of the Mint,,"
Turnbull informed his audience.
"Newton claimed he owed his success
to 'standing on giants.' The giants,
of course, were Descartes, his own
English associates, and scientists like
Leibniz from all of Europe."
That Famous Apple
The speaker verified the story of
the falling apple and Newton's sub
sequent work on the law of universal
gravitation. "This was typical of his
approach. He observed, worked back
to theories, while the other scientists
of his day began with theories and
worked down to particulars."
When Newton's greatest work, the
Principia, appeared, it was under
stood by only a few men. "It took 30
years for science to recognize the im
portance of his contributions."
Professor Turnbull ended with a
pica for greater moral understanding
in the world. He has hopes that some
modern giant will, like Newton, re
discover "some forgotten factor that
will restore sanity to the world."
