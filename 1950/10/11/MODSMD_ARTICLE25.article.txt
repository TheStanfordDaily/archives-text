The message from Communist Pre

desperation. Although he called for a
continuation of the war, in defiance

tums, the premier indicated North
Korea is short of arms, ammunition,
and food for the troops.
He admitted the Allies have erip
plcd North Korean railroads and
communications.

broadcast by the North Korean ra
dio, the Red capital of Pyongyang
was threatened from two direc
tions.
To the east, 92 miles from Pyong
yang, the South Koreans have cap
tured the big port of Wonsan at the
end of the only main cast-west high
way to the North Korean capital.
To the south, less than 80 miles
from Pyongyang, American troops
were hammering up the main north
south highway to the capital.
The Reds, fighting with h new
frenzy, were clinging desperately to
their defenses against the U.S. Ist
Cavalry on the Pyongyang highway
north of Kaesong.
Two South Korean divisions, who
had an easier time takinn Wonsan
yesterday, attacked early today to
ciear the Reds out of hills and ridges
