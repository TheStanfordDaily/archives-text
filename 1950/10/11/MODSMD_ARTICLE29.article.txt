# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
Last Saturday I made like Richard Halliburton, who
before his untimely death—specialized in doing mad,
impossible and dangerous things such as swimming in
the Taj Mahal pools and kicking cows in the streets of

Calcutta. Last Saturday J was
more daring and steadfast than
111 own Dave Harrah, who scaled
the unscalable "Butcher of the
Andes" this summer. Last Satur
day 1 was as courageous as Colin
Kelly, as daring as Simon Tem
plar, and as brave as Custer at
Lull Run.
Last Saturday I sal in the Cal

rooting section.
There may be some frosh among you who are not
acquainted with the Berkeley rah-rah section. Thus,
you cannot possibly appreciate the magnificence of
my feat.
The Bear rootejs, Dr. Sproul announced last week,
have averaged 8,001) casualties per game, due to stu
dents being rolled, wrecked, and ruined, and other
wise disposed of during the course of the gridiron
thrillers. I do not like to contemplate what would have
been my fate had the seething mass of roaring prole
tarians around me discovered that I was Stanford, and
hated Bob Celeri, Jack Jenson, and the North Koreans.
1 remember when we beat them in footba'l in 194(5
and they tore up the bleacher seats in their own sta
dium. 1 remember when they beat us in 1947 and tore
up our seats. I remember when they robbed us in 1948
and again tore up their own stadium seats.
But best of all I remember last year when we
couldn't catch Monachino or Swaner. The Cal root
ing section, with unusual kindliness, turned to the

press box behind them and shouted at one of the SF
sports editors who bail picked Stanford to win: "Leiser
lias no father." They yelled it over and over again, ig
noring the biological impossibility of their assertion as
well as any semblance of good taste.
Do you wonder that even my staunch frame shud
dered a little at the daring of my feat? (For an account
of the game, see sports.) I won't go into the game here;
needless to say, 1 sat iri a stunned daze at the horrible
orgy around rne.
The chap had the score of the last Bi" Game written
on his rooter's cap and tattooed in a prominent place
on his forehead. He was reading a copy of Das Kapital
(he was using a copy of the loyalty oath as a book
mark) and sang the Internationale instead of the alma
mater. He was a keen guy. and his comments on the
game weie extremely interesting, and I'm very sorry
that the Daily style guide does not-allow his comments
to appear here.
I did very well disguising myself as an (ugh) Cal
man (I'm not in very good shape anyway) until the
end of the game, when the yell leader told everyone
to stand up to sing the alma mater. I stood, and was
promptly trampled by the surge of Californians seek
ing the exit.
When I had finally recovered, and brushed the last
heel mark off my spine and consumed a handful of
straight bourbon (and not much else) old fashioneds
at a marvelous place called Bertola's in Berkeley, I
staggered home to receive the kindest cut of all.
A colleague of mine on the Daily had come out
claiming the credit for the name "Now Boys." He can't
get away with it. It is common knowledge among the
pledges in my house that I invented the name in 1897
while writing editorials for Hearst under the name of
Ambrose Bierce.

Calcutta. Last Saturday J was
more daring and steadfast than
111 own Dave Harrah, who scaled
the unscalable "Butcher of the
Andes" this summer. Last Satur
day 1 was as courageous as Colin
Kelly, as daring as Simon Tem
plar, and as brave as Custer at
Lull Run.
Last Saturday I sal in the Cal

rooting section.
There may be some frosh among you who are not
acquainted with the Berkeley rah-rah section. Thus,
you cannot possibly appreciate the magnificence of
my feat.
The Bear rootejs, Dr. Sproul announced last week,
have averaged 8,001) casualties per game, due to stu
dents being rolled, wrecked, and ruined, and other
wise disposed of during the course of the gridiron
thrillers. I do not like to contemplate what would have
been my fate had the seething mass of roaring prole
tarians around me discovered that I was Stanford, and
hated Bob Celeri, Jack Jenson, and the North Koreans.
1 remember when we beat them in footba'l in 194(5
and they tore up the bleacher seats in their own sta
dium. 1 remember when they beat us in 1947 and tore
up our seats. I remember when they robbed us in 1948
and again tore up their own stadium seats.
But best of all I remember last year when we
couldn't catch Monachino or Swaner. The Cal root
ing section, with unusual kindliness, turned to the

press box behind them and shouted at one of the SF
sports editors who bail picked Stanford to win: "Leiser
lias no father." They yelled it over and over again, ig
noring the biological impossibility of their assertion as
well as any semblance of good taste.
Do you wonder that even my staunch frame shud
dered a little at the daring of my feat? (For an account
of the game, see sports.) I won't go into the game here;
needless to say, 1 sat iri a stunned daze at the horrible
orgy around rne.
The chap had the score of the last Bi" Game written
on his rooter's cap and tattooed in a prominent place
on his forehead. He was reading a copy of Das Kapital
(he was using a copy of the loyalty oath as a book
mark) and sang the Internationale instead of the alma
mater. He was a keen guy. and his comments on the
game weie extremely interesting, and I'm very sorry
that the Daily style guide does not-allow his comments
to appear here.
I did very well disguising myself as an (ugh) Cal
man (I'm not in very good shape anyway) until the
end of the game, when the yell leader told everyone
to stand up to sing the alma mater. I stood, and was
promptly trampled by the surge of Californians seek
ing the exit.
When I had finally recovered, and brushed the last
heel mark off my spine and consumed a handful of
straight bourbon (and not much else) old fashioneds
at a marvelous place called Bertola's in Berkeley, I
staggered home to receive the kindest cut of all.
A colleague of mine on the Daily had come out
claiming the credit for the name "Now Boys." He can't
get away with it. It is common knowledge among the
pledges in my house that I invented the name in 1897
while writing editorials for Hearst under the name of
Ambrose Bierce.

Last Saturday I made like Richard Halliburton, who
before his untimely death—specialized in doing mad,
impossible and dangerous things such as swimming in
the Taj Mahal pools and kicking cows in the streets of

Calcutta. Last Saturday J was
more daring and steadfast than
111 own Dave Harrah, who scaled
the unscalable "Butcher of the
