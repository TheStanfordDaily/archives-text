## More on Racial Segregation 
### 
To the Editor:
It was with great interest that I read the letter by
Mr. Close printed in yesterday's Daily.
Certain basic allegations seem to underlie this un
fortunate failure to grant recognition to the advances
o! sociology both in practice und in theory that most
people, I feel, consider not only desirable but essential
to the proper and fair functioning of the community in
which we live.
The old arguments on either side of the relative su
periority or inferiority of races theory have been too
often advanced to require restatement or refutation
here.
What we must accept, if the question of racial segra
gation v. non-segregation is to be answered satisfac
torily and to the best interests of the community at
luige, is that there happens to exist in this country
more than one color of skin.
It is true, beyond dispute, that the nature of man is
to fear and even hate that which is not like himself or
that he does not understand. This would seem to indi
cate that ignorance may be the basis ol much of those
inter-racial difficulties that seem to be at issue.
Certainly the best cure for the immediate problem
would be absolute and unconditional segregation.
This, of course, could most easily be accomplished by
establishing a separate nation for whites and blacksâ€”
probaLly wit!) a buffer state between of part-white and
part-black.
As may readily be seen, struggle for control of this
>tate as a satellite would immediately begin. Both
sides would consider its friendliness as essential to
national security.
Once again a simple solution to the problem may be
had. It is merely necessary, as with conflicting ideolo
gies, that conflicting skin colors engage in a nicely or
ganized and regulated war to determine the question
of absolute superiority and preclude the possibility of
minor border skirmishes continuing over the years.
No longer would it be necessary to cope with the
white and black problem on a personal level. Inde
pendent thinking and/or action would be absolutely
unnecessary and the individual citizen could concen
trate his energies on more important matters than hu
man relations."
'1 herefore I propose the removal of all white citizens
from the area west of the Rocky Mountains, and the
removal of all Negro citizens from the area east there
of. The resulting nations and their mighty conflict
may then begin to confound history students of the
future.
