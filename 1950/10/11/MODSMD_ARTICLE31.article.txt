Mi. Donald Close's letter on racial segregation is a
good example of the excuses that are made, either de
liberately or in good faith, to hide the real purpose of
segregation.
1 he proponents of the "separate, but equal" theory
ignore 01 do not realize the fact that segregation in
it' ell implies inequality. Mr. Close's own words: "In a
segregated society, the members of each race know
exactly their .status"; illustrates this point.
With equality, there is no need to know exactly your
tatus it is the same for all. Segregation is used to
impose a special status on a minority group, a.sit is
thus easier to l.riny various forms of economic oppres
: ion to bear upon that group. When groups are not
allowed to contact each other and discover that there
i no basic difference between them, they come to ac
< ept disci iminalion against the minority a.s the right of
the "superior" over the "inferior."
And one of the favorite rea.jons used bv the sup
porters of segregation to justify the policy is that it
will prevent racial intermarriage. They thus take ad
vantage nl a basic socially-developed human charac
teii.tic that of considering those superficially unlike
you as somehow inferior. It might be pointed out that
< ven il U.S. society generally rejects racial intermar
i iaj »\ many other important countries accept it, reject
ing segregation and do not have "race" riots, either.
The fact that a social structure has been accepted for
many years does not make it correct, and it is up to
the people to change an incorrect social policy. Ol
course, an end to segregation is but a small step toward
tli(' olulion o| the problem. Further laws, such as Pair
I.inployment Practices, and general education of the
people should accompany it.
If we are willing to lesrn and act upon our learning,
