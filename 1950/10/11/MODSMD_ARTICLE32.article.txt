To the Editor:
Blood typing is seldom discussed openly; however,
it is so closely related to certain modern social prob
lems that it cannot be ignored. We believe that Mr.
Close's fundamental principles of segregation are bas
ically sound, but he treats this important social prob
lem much too mildly. Is racial segregation enough?
Think of it, Fellow Americans, how would you like
to have your children growing up next door to a Blood
Type - 'AB" family? The time to act is now!
Let's send the Type "O" specimens, obviously in
ferior, back to where they came from, above the 38th
parallel, before our modern civilization is eventually
destroyed!
We leave it to you, Stanford Students, to protect the
ideals and blood types upon which this country was
founded! And, in closing, we remind you that it is your
duty not to overlook the "Rh" factor.
