To the Editor:
Mr. Close stated in his letter that segregation in itself
is not the cause for the impoverishment of "some" of
the Negroes in "certain" sections of the South. This
obviously leaves a great number, the majority in fact,
untouched by his rather flippant generalizations.
The fact of the matter is that Mr. Close is asking us
all to continue piling excuse upon excuse, to absolve
ourselves of blame for a situation which we created
and, through selfish interest, have maintained.
He speaks quite righteously about "greater individ
ual freedom" and other patsy phrases, yet advocates a
policy of restricting free exchange of ideas between
the races by complete segregation. This is no solution
to the problem, but only a hypocritical pretense at
.solution through ignoring the problem.
Mr. Close refuses to deal with the individual Negro
who is entitled to live the same life as we do, but rather
puts him ofl in his own little camp with the excuse that
"he will be happier there."
Okay, Mr. Close, put on your halter and blinders
and continue to pull the Great White Milk Wagon, all
the while munching the swill of bigotry which oblivi
ates you to positive action, but don't expect me to ride
the milk wagon with you.
