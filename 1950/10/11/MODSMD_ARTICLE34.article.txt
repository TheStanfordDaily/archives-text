To the Editor:
]n regard to Tuesday's editorial we would like to ask
the editor why he considers a yearly performance of
Handel's "Messiah"' a criterion of stature of a music
department. We are sorry that the editor has failed
thus lar to see the accomplishments of this relatively
new department.
Just in the past three years there have been such
large scale performances as "Peter Grimes," "Schwan
da the Bagpiper," the Contemporary Music Festival,
the Bach B Minor Mass, and the 14 other concerts
which made up the Bach Festival. In one year the
orchestra itself has »rown in size and proficiency, giv
ing at least three concerts a year; each quarter several
chamber music concerts are given by the students and
are of a top quality of performance.
One reason, perhaps, for the Daily's ignorance of
the scope of activity in this department is their con
tinued attitude of indifference in publicity and lack of
accuracy in reviewing. The department is a proud one
not only because of it.s activity in performance but also
because of it.s large number of courses, excellent stalf,
and programs of study leading to various academic
degrees. We hope that this year we will not longer Le
regarded as a mere appendage to the University but
as an integral part of University activity and study.

(Editor's Note.—The Daily as well as the student
body as a whole have appreciated the rise of the
Music Department in strength as typified by its well
received programs. However, we feel that there is
still something to be added which would increase
even more the prestige of Stanford. This something
is the singing of Handel's "Messiah." ,
(The blame for poor reviews in previous volumes
of the Daily rests squarely on the paper's shoulders.
This is one sphere of our writing which we hope to
improve this year by assigning the reviews to spe
cialized staff writers )
