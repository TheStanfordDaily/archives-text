# Mills Draws Mass Migration from Farm

### DAVE MEEK 
Stanford men have proven once
again their reputation for taking
advantage of an opportunity.
'lhe Mills College Fireside invi
tation to all Stanford men was a
scene of mass confusion last Sat
urday night Frantic hostesses in
the overcrowded halls were bewil
dered by the "unexpected response"
from Stanford bachelors.
Their estimate that approximate
ly ten Stanford men appeared for
every available Mills, girl seems
conservative. Some of the fellows
claimed that the ratio was much
higher. Whatever it was, cars filled
with eager young Stanford men
kept streaming in from 8:30 to mid
night.
Frenzied Hostess
One frenzied hostess put her hand
to her forehead and desperately
tried to explain to each new group
of well-dressed hopefuls, "We've
sent out invitations like this before,
but never since I've been here has
there been anything like this!"
Another remark heard over and
over again was, "Wot a mob!" From
out of the buzzing conversation at
one of the halls a delightful femi
nine voice broke out, "Why, every
unmarried Stanford man must be
here."
Those who didn't try to buck the
crowds sat in their cars and con
templated where they might go
where it wasn't so crowded.

The excited confusion crept into
the morning hours before it grad
ually died away. Peace returned to
the refined halls once more and one
of the weary, unbelieving hostesses
was heard to remark, "There will
never be anything like it again."
