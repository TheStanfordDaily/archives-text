# Russia Blasts U.S. Plan
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, Oct. 10â€”Russia
warned today that adoption of the
American plan to boost the power
of the veto - free United Nations
General Assembly might be
"fraught with very dire conse
quences for the peace of the world."
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Y. Vishinsky rejected the proposal
to earmark national troop units that
could be used by the Assembly if a
veto blocked Security Council ac
tion.
Instead, he told the Assembly's
main political committee that his
government would propose formal
ly a Big Five conference to map
steps t<! keep world peace. One of
the main tasks of such a parley, he
said, would be to carry out UN
charter provisions for creation of a
UN police force.
