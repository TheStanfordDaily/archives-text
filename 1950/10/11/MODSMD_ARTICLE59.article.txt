# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry

Dink Templeton, in our opinion the Bay Area's best sports columnist,
blasted out a column last night for the Palo Alto Times. Dink, whose col
umns are usually worth reprinting, has made some good points about the
Big Red and, since at Stanford nearly nobody reads the Times, we are lending
our space today to what you probably didn't see yesterday.
"Now let us not have a lot of baloney about how Santa Clara always make#
it tough for Stanford and this is going to be a close, tough battle next Satur
day."
The Dink goes on to point out that the Independents on the Coast have
been pushed into nothing by trying to observe PCC rules that they have
nothing to do with. "What high school star, given a choice between a Con
ference college and an independent, is going to choose the latter?" He goes j
on to suggest that the independents "could have a very swell Conference ,
of their own. Santa Clara, St. Mary's, USF, San Jose State, Pacific, Fresno j
State, and Loyola, with their own rules."
All of which is immaterial to this column, lie gets back to Stanford
with: "Stanford is a team which has no right losing more than one game
this season, and Santa Clara is at its lowest ebb. having lost almost its
entire team of last season and having little or nothing to replace it with.
Dick Gallagher has a long rebuilding job ahead of him, but he knew, and
was prepared for it, that he had to take his lumps this year.
"The Broncs are pretty well-loved enemies of the Indians, but that is no
excuse for a letdown, a taking-it-easy, a kidding of themselves that it's going
to be a tough buttle, mother, and being satisfied with a two-touchdown win. ;
"Not that (lie score counts, but how they get it does. Stanford has a date
along about six weeks from now with a team that plays to kill 'em on
every play. That's Army, and the sooner the boys get it through their
heads they haven't too long to go before getting brains knocked out of
those heads, the better chance they'll have of coming out of battle with
out cashing in their insurance.
"The USF game was a start on preparation for Army. The San Jose game
certainly was not, and from all I can gather they reverted to good natured
sporting on the green for that Oregon State win last Saturday.
"I can see little determination to be ready for Army and the tactics they
are krtown to use and get away with. But unless they start playing that kind
of football and stick with it, they are going to get their season ruined, and j
1 do mean ruined, the last two Saturdays of the schedule, no matter how |
badly they've outclassed all opponents.
"They can play Army like little gentlemen, and there won't be any
thing left to hold off that Cal power in the Big Game. Or they can come
through like Bull Driscoll and Robeskie did in '28 and be far more ready
for Cal than any easy game could make them.
"That '28 Stanford line got the shock of its life when it discovered how
Army played football back in Yankee Stadium. The boys had no warning of
it, and Dynie Post was out of the game. But it didn't take them long to get
onto it, and what Bull and Don did to the bully boys of West Point could
have earned 'em a treason trial.
"Next year West Point came out here and the boys were well prepared
for them. There are still thousands of people around who recall the tackle
ordinarily mild-mannered Lud Frentrup made on Red Cagle. It was out in
the open, a good clean blast that rocked the great Ail-American clean out
of the game in the first quarter. And he didn't come back. That's the kind
of tackling necessary to keep Stanford from going into the Big Game crippled
up and beaten before they start."
Thanks, Dink, and you can write columns for us any time.
By the way, we call out on our weekly prediction this time, and pick
the Stanford Indians to beat the Santa Clara Broncos by five touchdowns.
Wheel mommy, pass the bourbon.
