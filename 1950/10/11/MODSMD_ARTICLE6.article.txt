# Draft Proposal May Hit Houses
## Winbigler Warns Fraternity Men Against Stepped-up Induction Plan 
### 
More than 60 Stanford fraternity men gathered at Dr. Sterling's
home last night to hear Dean of Students Donald Winbigler warn
them against losing 'up to three-fourths of their members by next
September if draft legislation increases."
Dean Winbigler indicated that a "new deferment proposal"

was now being considered in top gov
ernment circles that might take as
many as one-half the number of
sophomores, two-thirds the number
of juniors, and three-fourths the
number of seniors from University
life in the immediate years to come.
As a result of such a stepped-up
draft program, the Dean said,
"there is a real reason for you to be
concerned about the stability of
your houses—especially as to grade
point averages."
In addition. Winbigler stated that
the houses with the "highest morale
and spirit" would be the ones most
likely to survive such a drastic mea
sure, which he indicated was a defi
nite possibility.
Following the Dean's informal talk,
President Sterling said it was the
self-same opinion he issued upon
coming to the University 18 months
ago. He said:
"As far as Stanford fraternities
arc concerned, we need them—but
only so long as they continue to
serve the University. I would say
the same thing in regard to any
campus living group."
Presiding at last night's meeting
was Interfraternity Council president
Dave Larimer. Following Dr. Ster
ling's words, Larimer exhorted all
fraternity officers present to "take
back what you have heard here and
pass it on to your men."
Other speakers at the meeting
were Head Veil Leader Pete "Red
dog" Henderson, who outlined a
program now underway to build up
the Resident Assistant program
within fraternities; Mr. Sterling
Silver, Stanford Village commis
sary manager; and Mr. Fred
Glover, University director of in
formation.

more than a little interested in "getting my picture taken." —photo by Russ Lapham
