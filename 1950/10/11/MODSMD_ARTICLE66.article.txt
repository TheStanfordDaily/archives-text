# Farm Coed Reveals Mysteries of T-Ball
## 
### SADIE PODUNK 
Football has always been for me
one of life's greatest mysteries. Like
many another coed, my under
standing of the game had been lim
ited to such basic concepts as
touchdowns, huddles, pompoms, and
"Give 'em the Axe!"
Although I knew that there were
11 men on each team (as distin
guished by their matched uniforms
in sharply contrasting shades with
highly stylized shoulder pads to
give that new wasp-waist look), I
had no idea of who did what or
why. Not, that is, until the other
night.
The Awakening
I was having coffee at the Cellar
the other night with my boy friend.
And I thought that was a good op
portunity to ask him to explain
football to me a little more fully.
Ten cups and an hour and a half
later, my confusion was gone and I
was a reasonably competent expert
on at least one all-important phase
of the offensive line-up, the famous
T-zone.
The T-formation is one in which
none of the members of the team is
at all unbalanced. That is, the for
mation is the same on both sides of
the same team. In the line (which
is the line opposite the enemy line,
both of which lie to one side of and
parallel with the scrimmage line),
there are seven linemen. In the
center is the center. At each end is
an end. Simple so far? And several
guards and a couple of tackles stand
here and there between them.
Moving back from the line, di
rectly behind the center we find the
quarterback. This term by no
means implies a physical deformity.
It simply means that he is one
quarter of the way back from
where the linemen are to where the
backfield isn't.
"Things Get Confusing"
Each halfback (there are two of
them) stands beside the fullback
and waits for the center to pass the
ball to the quarterback. Now is

when things get confusing. Because
now the quarter either keeps the
ball or passes it to one of the other
three backs (or various fractions
thereof) or hands it to one of the
ends who has meanwhile run from
his place in the line to behind
where the center was before the
other team piled on top of him.
And whoever has the pigskin has
doubtless been tackled meanwhile.
So after the umpire gets the ball
carrier out from under seven or
eight members of the opposition
who have fallen on top of him, we
call it a second down.
This process is repeated approxi
mately four times until one team
gains ten or more yards, or until
someone smashes through the line
and breaks away for a tremendous
sprint to the end zone for a touch
down. In case the other team
snatches the ball away from the
carrier, this is called a fumble. If
the first team doesn't recover from
it, then they become quite defen
sive, while the other side becomes
very offensive about the whole
thing.
And that sums up briefly for the
uninformed what is known in sta
dium vernacular as the T-forma
tion. See you at the game Saturday!
