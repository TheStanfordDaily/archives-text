# Board to Consider Rain-Making Plan
## 
### 
The Santa Clara C-junty Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to
spend $3,250 to study the feasibility
of rain-making for the county next
winter and spring.
The Water Resources Develop
ment Corporation of Pasadena, the
firm selected to make the survey,
was attempting to obtain a billion
dollar liability policy. The policy is
to insure the county against any
damage suit arising from increased
precipitation.
The billion - dollar policy would
provide insurance against claims for
too much rain falling and against
suits from neighboring areas that
felt their precipitation had been
"stolen."
