The answers to the questions in the Shish-
Kebab ad of last week s DAILY are the
following.
1. Shish in Turkish means skewer. Kebab is a meat
broiled over a charcoal fire.
2. The meat of lamb is used because it is a religious
belief among Mohammedans not to eat pork. They
choose lamb because of its tender meat. Today lead
ing physicians in various hospitals recommend a lamb
chop to their patients as they claim it is the only anti
acid meat.
