### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. II (UP) —
Secretary of State Dean Achcson
reaffirmed today the American plan
t<» include a fully armed German
force in the projected Western Eu
ropean army as French authorities,
who are opposed to the proposal,
arrived here for official talks.
Acheson told a press conference
the plan is as sound now as when
he laid it before the Big Three For
eign Ministers and the North At
lantic Pact Council in New York
last month. He said it is based on
the theory that Western Germans
are ready to take part in the fight
against Communism.
On other foreign policy issues,
Achcson said that no consideration
js being given to sending U.S.
troops to Indo-China to help the
French fight Communist armies
there. He said aid already is being
sent under the military assistance
program.
