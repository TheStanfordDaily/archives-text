# ROAD PLAN
## May Ease Farm Car Difficulties 
### 
The campus car problem—which
consists of "just too many cars"—
may soon be alleviated, thanks to a
changeover in University policy an
nounced by Business Manager Alf
Brandin last night.
Speaking before the Menlo Park
city councilors, Brandin said the
University is now "open-minded" to
the development of a major east
west road crossing the campus and
paralleling San Francisquito Creek.
Brandin was called before the
council at the last minute after the
town fathers had been presented
with a map of a new subdivision
planned for the old Hopkins estate
lying adjacent to San Francisquito
Creek.
Willow Road Extension
Among other things, the subdivi
sion plans call for the extension of
Willow Road (which now runs from
Bayshorc to Middlefietd Road) to
El Camino Real.
Further, ban Mateo County plan
ners have long been considering
extension of Willow Road to a junc
tion with Portola Road or Sand Hill
Road to make it a major east-west
highway from the coast to the Bay.
Such a thoroughfare would pre
sumably cross University property.
Brandin last night agreed to a
60-day moratorium on the Willow
Road construction in order to study
the problem more fully and con
duct an "over-all land study."
Take I-oad Off Campus
He said today construction of the
artery would take the load off the
campus car problem, in so far as
many residents living behind Menlo
Park and Stanford now drive
through the campus to reach El
Camino and points cast.
He said the University has op
posed the development for 25 years
because it felt there was insufficient
business and population in the area
to warrant construction.
Both an overpass and underpass
have been suggested as a means of
effecting the projected Willow
Road-El Camino Real crossing.
