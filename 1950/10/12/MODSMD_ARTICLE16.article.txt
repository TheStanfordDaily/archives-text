## Stanford's Land to Be Subdivided 
### 
Stanford land, the last great hold- j
ing on the Peninsula, will be subdi- |
vided for industrial Mid residential :
purposes.
President Wallace Sterling an
nounced yesterday that the San j
Francisco firm of Punnett-Parez &
Hutchinson, nationally-known plan
ning engineering firm, has been en
gaged to advise the University on
plans for the development of Stanford
lands. He cautioned that this step is
part of a long-range program and
that no immediate construction is
contemplated except possibly in two
small sections of the 7,000 acres of
undeveloped University lands sur
rounding the 1,800-acre campus.
Approach
The president said that the plan
will be approached from the stand
point of determining how the Uni
versity lands will best fit into the
| pattern of development of the Palo
Alto area. The master plan will in
! dicate the engineers' views on which
areas are most suitable for residen
tial, commercial, recreational, agri
cultural, light industrial, and other
types of development.
It will take from six months to a
year to complete the master plan, al
though certain areas, such as a sec
tion south of Palo Alto and another
along San Francisquito Creek, in
San Mateo County, may be devel
oped before the overall plan is com
pleted.
Plan Industry
Light industrial development is
planned for the 40-acre section which
lies west of El Camino Heal and
south of the Los Gatos branch of the
Southern Pacific below South Palo
Alto. Residential development is
planned for 14 acres of another 24-
acrc section on the San Mateo County
| side of San Francisquito Creek just
across the creek from the fourth tee
of the Stanford golf course; the re
maining 10 acres of this section will
be used as a site for a new school.
Dr. Sterling pointed out that Stan
ford has long contemplated develop
ment of its large acreage as one of the
University's major assets; but "World
War 11, uncertainty in construction
costs, and the need to plan such a
vast undertaking carefully, with the
interests of neighboring communities
in mind, have always delayed action
on the program.
