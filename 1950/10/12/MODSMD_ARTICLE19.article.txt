# Li'l Injun To Sport New Name At Bronco Game
## 64 Entries As Contest Ends 
### 
Stanford's favorite and only
mascot is destined to make a
grand appearance at the Santa
Clara game Saturday, but no
one, not even the obsolescent
Oskie up at Berkeley, is sure
what name ho will be sporting.
For as the paper goes to press, a
committee of Rally Com members
headed by Yell Leader Pete Hen
derson is mulling over the (54 en
tries submitted in the "re-name the
Li'l Injun contest" which closed
yesterday. Henderson promises the
judging will go through the night, if
necessary, and the Christian name
of the imitation Indian will defi
nitely be announced in tomorrow's
Daily.
As things stand now, Stanford's
8,000 rooters may end up Saturday
giving the Big Six for anything

The first all-freshman activity of
the quarter will take place tonight
when the freshman class rallies on
the steps of Emilia Hall at 7:30.
The rally, under the direction of
Derek Bok. is in honor of the fresh
man football team which goes
against the Santa Clara frosh Sat
urday..

from "Chief Yoo-hoo" to "Money
haha." Ahose were two of the M
names submitted.
One student, presumably a frus
trated Chappie fan, suggested
"Warren G. Wampum." Another
thought the Indian should answer
to tbe call of "Axford." Probably
the most intellectual title was that
of "Nimi-Oroc"; the entrant went
on to say that in the Constantanoan
Indian vernacular, "nimi" means
bear and "oroc" means killer; the
result—bear killer.
The word "red" seems to be a
favorite with the students. About
a dozen names included the color—
"Little Red," "Big Fed," "Red
Chief," "Red Axe," "Red Bluff,"
"Red Pepper," ad infinitum and ad
nauseam.
All of the suggestions were origi
nal, and most were humorous. Oth
ers which the judges must choose
from are "Wampum - Stompum,"
"Tommy Tom - Tom," "Drofnats,"
"Scal-a-pum," "Smokey," "Win
dian," and just plain "Stanley."
Henderson said the committee, in
choosing a name, would keep in
mind its applicability for yells.
Guess maybe that might rule this
one out—"Ugh!"


THE LI'L INJUN, whose new name will be revealed in tomor
row's Daily, is shown practicing his horsemanship ability. He
will be out to break the Santa Clara Bronco at Saturday after
noon's game. —Daily photo by Jerry Schwab
