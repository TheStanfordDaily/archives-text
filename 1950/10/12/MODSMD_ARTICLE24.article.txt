# Student Help Needed To Set Up Farm YMCA
## 
### 
Stanford may soon have a YMCA.
A proposal to organize a campus YMCA was presented last
night to the Church Committee meeting by a student group
which has worked toward the formation of such an organization.
At present no such men's organization exists on campus to carry

out the many functions that such a
group can do.
The chairman of this group, Paul
Watson, announced that a meeting
will be held Oct. 19 at 7:30 p.m.
when ways and means of sett! up
the organization as soon as possible
will be discussed. He emphasized
that student participation and ideas
wi ! i be vitally needed at this meet
ing. since at present only a small
nucleus exists and a large number
of students will be required to
start a YMCA.
The general objectives of this
group will be those of all YMCA
organizations — development of
spirit, mind, and body. More spe
cifically, there are present needs
which this organization can fit),
such as the formation of student -
faculty discussion groups for Kn
cina frosh and other living
groups.
Another need is the teaching of
Village Sunday school groups. U is
hoped suggestions for other func
tions will be presented by students
at the coming meeting.
Flans far x> YMCA have been
studied since last year when a
committee of .'{o was selected to
discuss the setting up of a reli
gious group on campus After
several meetings, it was decided
thai a specific men's organization
was needed.
Although a women's YWCA ex
isted, there was no corresponding
! organization for men. A subc»»rn
-1 mittee of Paul WaU:on, Dad K>ri
j worthy, Ken West, and Paul Mot -
| row proposed the organization of a
I YMCA to fill the existing student
I needs.
This quarter Jim Mansfield and
Pete Barney joined the group.
