# In Defense of the Golfers...

The Stanford golf course i9 recognized as
one of the finest —if not the toughest—lB-hole
layouts in this area. Moreover, many Stanford
students are dyed-in-the-wool divot diggers.
Nevertheless, many of the many are discour
aged from playing golf at Stanford simply be
cause they have to stand around twiddling their
sticks for hours at a time before being given an
opportunity to tee off.
These students of the game feel part of the
delay is due to maladministration of the course
a "crowded" condition that is more artificial
than it is actual.
In the first place, on supposedly "crowded"
days, twosomes, threesomes, and even single
players are given separate starting times —all
cl which aggravates the delay.
by v/ay of a remedy, we'd suggest that the
person in charge of starting times pair up two
somes, add onesomes to threesomes, and other
wise make certain that all teeing off is done
in groups of four. This practice has been
proven a time - saver and is used by many
courses afflicted with overcrowdedness.
Secondly, many golfers have fallen into
the habit of signing only one name opposite a

starting time, regardless of how big their party
is. This practice should be eliminated so that
the starter will know definitely how many are
signed up and therefore how many he (or she)
sUtrsild include frcm another group to make up
a foursome.
Thirdly, an increasingly large number of
overanxious golfers have been signing their
names to starting times, then illegally taking off
for the second nine without so much as cross
ing their names from the starter's list.
Such students only add to the confusion al
ready present and at the same time commit
themselves to an act punishable by expulsion
from the course.
Golf at Stanford is growing in popularity.
Courses of instruction in the game are increas
ing in enrollment while more and more men
and women are taking up divot-digging as a
weekly pastime.
To keep pace with the high interest, we'd
suggest that those in charge of the home course
take a look-see into their administrative short
comings and make a concerted effort to im
prove the situation.
It can be done!—R. R.
