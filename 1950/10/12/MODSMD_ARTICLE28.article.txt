Somewhere in the Sierra Nevadas
OPEN LETTER lO STANFORD WOMEN
Dear Girls:
You are wasting your time. I am a man not easily
frightened . . . except, of course, when my mother's
not around. The threats which you have showered
upon me since my proclamation of SEGDOGD Month

will get you nowhere. So far, in
fact, they have only gotten me to
the Sierra Nevadas.
And 1 can't say too little about
your paying Otis Chandler to
throw me to Korea ... I convinced
him in a minute that he'd make
more money by having his date
pay her own way Big Game Night
(actually, he got a letter from the

AAU saying they wouldn't allow the record even it ne
did toss me that far, since I'm several ounces under
the official shotput weight).
No, girls, as Apollo said to Venus when she turned
up in full attire, you don't show me much. What's
more, us social chairman of the old SX Frat & Diner,
I've been getting the full scoop on just how much it's
gonna cost Big Game Night, and, girls—oh, I just love
telling you—you can count on about twelve (12) bucks
to cover your part in the festivities . . . What was that
remark? Girls, remember, we don't have that kind of
talk here. . . .
It pains me to think that a few of you—only a few,
I know—don't welcome the opportunity to share the
financial burden for this gala occasion with your escort.
But then, of course, I realize that Stanford Oil stock
has gone down a full point in the past three years, and
father's financial situation really can't stand any fur
ther strain . . . what with the cost of yachts and all.
And just because your date is putting himself

through college is no reason why you should go with
out that cute frock you saw in the window at Kelsey's
. . . of course, it is the fifth you've bought this quarter,
but it was only $591.95 and it will look so chic when
you come down to Sunday breakfast after the party.
But just so you won't feel too sorry for yourselves,
girls, the ATO's are throwing a nice party Saturday
night at Mangini's just for you ... in fact, it's dedi
cated to you . . . the HOG WALLOW, they call it.
And I know you're all going to enjoy it so because it
won't cost you a single cent.
Of course, your evening will probably be ruined
when you find it won't cost your date anything either
. . . but you can always tell him the Barn's too hot or
too crowded or something, and have him take you to
Rosott's and BUY you a beer (oh, I see, Milady, the
fashionable thing is to get a buzz on at L'Ommie's first
and then come up and watch the peasants, is it? Well,
remind me to whisper something to you when I'm
finished, will you?)
Now, girls, I think we all know where each Stanford
Woman and each Stanford Man stands on this subject,
so you can see you really haven't much choice. And
we don't want you to think we feel bitter or that we
think your attitude is poor, because, of course, we do.
Remember the slogan for Nov. 25, SEGDOGD . . .
She Either Goes Dutch Or Gets Ditched! And just in
case you don't think it's being taken seriously, I know
of several guys who've sent their girls wooden shoes
this week.
See you at the bank,
Your humble & obedient servant,
VIC (The Student Chintz) PALMIERI
THOUGHT FOR TODAY
If she don't act nice
When you tell her the price,
Take my advice . . . ditch the witch.

through college is no reason why you should go with
out that cute frock you saw in the window at Kelsey's
. . . of course, it is the fifth you've bought this quarter,
but it was only $591.95 and it will look so chic when
you come down to Sunday breakfast after the party.
But just so you won't feel too sorry for yourselves,
girls, the ATO's are throwing a nice party Saturday
night at Mangini's just for you ... in fact, it's dedi
cated to you . . . the HOG WALLOW, they call it.
And I know you're all going to enjoy it so because it
won't cost you a single cent.
Of course, your evening will probably be ruined
when you find it won't cost your date anything either
. . . but you can always tell him the Barn's too hot or
too crowded or something, and have him take you to
Rosott's and BUY you a beer (oh, I see, Milady, the
fashionable thing is to get a buzz on at L'Ommie's first
and then come up and watch the peasants, is it? Well,
remind me to whisper something to you when I'm
finished, will you?)
Now, girls, I think we all know where each Stanford
Woman and each Stanford Man stands on this subject,
so you can see you really haven't much choice. And
we don't want you to think we feel bitter or that we
think your attitude is poor, because, of course, we do.
Remember the slogan for Nov. 25, SEGDOGD . . .
She Either Goes Dutch Or Gets Ditched! And just in
case you don't think it's being taken seriously, I know
of several guys who've sent their girls wooden shoes
this week.
See you at the bank,
Your humble & obedient servant,

If she don't act nice
When you tell her the price,
Take my advice . . . ditch the witch.

Somewhere in the Sierra Nevadas
OPEN LETTER lO STANFORD WOMEN
Dear Girls:
You are wasting your time. I am a man not easily
frightened . . . except, of course, when my mother's
not around. The threats which you have showered
upon me since my proclamation of SEGDOGD Month

will get you nowhere. So far, in
fact, they have only gotten me to
the Sierra Nevadas.
And 1 can't say too little about
your paying Otis Chandler to
throw me to Korea ... I convinced
him in a minute that he'd make
more money by having his date
pay her own way Big Game Night
(actually, he got a letter from the

AAU saying they wouldn't allow the record even it ne
did toss me that far, since I'm several ounces under
the official shotput weight).
No, girls, as Apollo said to Venus when she turned
up in full attire, you don't show me much. What's
more, us social chairman of the old SX Frat & Diner,
I've been getting the full scoop on just how much it's
gonna cost Big Game Night, and, girls—oh, I just love
telling you—you can count on about twelve (12) bucks
to cover your part in the festivities . . . What was that
remark? Girls, remember, we don't have that kind of
talk here. . . .
It pains me to think that a few of you—only a few,
I know—don't welcome the opportunity to share the
financial burden for this gala occasion with your escort.
But then, of course, I realize that Stanford Oil stock
has gone down a full point in the past three years, and
father's financial situation really can't stand any fur
ther strain . . . what with the cost of yachts and all.
And just because your date is putting himself

through college is no reason why you should go with
out that cute frock you saw in the window at Kelsey's
. . . of course, it is the fifth you've bought this quarter,
but it was only $591.95 and it will look so chic when
