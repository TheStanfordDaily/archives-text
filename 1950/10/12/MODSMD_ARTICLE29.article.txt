# CAMPUS OPINION
## You Rum, Palmieri!

To the Bull Sessionists:
I'm sick und tired of hearing and reading about Stan
ford "pigs." We've all heard of the female Stanford
pij/! What, then, is a Stanford male?
We imply that since we are all members of the Stan
ford "Family" and "Farm," that Stanford men are na
turally the male of swine, a boar! Or is it spelled bore?
Or perhaps boor?
K is logical to conclude from the above statement
that we are all members of the swine family. That is
to '.ay, we are either sows or boars, respectively!
Now, at last, we have established the nature of u
Stanford man. Let us go farther in a description of
the beast.
/\ Loar is primarily, "a wild hog or male swine." A
l.ore is also, "a tiresome person or thing." And if you
prefer to pronounce it differently, "a boor is, "a peas
ant: a rude, clownish person." These may be valid
descriptions, and all seem to fit.
This idea of a Pork Student Body, howover, doesn't
appeal to me. May I offer an alternative? Let is all
make believe we are homo sapiens instead of swine.
Itt member, that for every "pig" there is a "boar."

Ami for every MAN at Stanford there is at least
one-third of a woman who is no worse, no better,
(jut equivalent to his looks and character!
