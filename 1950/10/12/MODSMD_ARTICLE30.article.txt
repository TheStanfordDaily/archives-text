I certainly appreciate the compliment you paid me
in your column regarding the work of ASSU's Foreign
Scholarship Committee. But for the sake of exactness,
it is only fitting to give credit where it is justly de
served. I ain referring to the work performed by the
other co-chairman of the committee, Earl Hagadorn.
Without his efforts this summer i;: arranging the
travel plans of all of the foreign students, our program
could never have succeeded D 3 it did. Probably the
most difficult part of the vv.iolt progiam wus his job—
the hectic jockeying and praying which is necessary
to get all of the stcrk-ots to SU.moi i in lime lor orien
tation.
Our program is actually a vulture »vhich requires
the co-operation of all Ssnr.loH students to make it
a concrete step toward greater world understanding.
