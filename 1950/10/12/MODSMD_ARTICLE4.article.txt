SAIGON, Indo - China â€” The
United States promised today that
arms will be delivered "as fast as
possible" for the Viet-Namese and
French forces who have suffered
setbacks from the Communists in
the last few days.
French officials admitted that
their forces had taken a drastic
beating from the well-trained Viet-
Minh Communists north of That
kbe. They said they had no further
news about some 3,000 French
troops trapped in the mountainous
jungles near the Chinese border.
