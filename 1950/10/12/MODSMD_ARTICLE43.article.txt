COMICS WEAKLY, a new Thursday night comedy feature on
KZSU, will be aired for the second time tonight at 7:45. On hand
each week will be Dick Cox and Kip Todd, who, with the aid of
a pretty guest star, will dramatize the following Sunday's San
Francisco Eximiner section in advance. Cutting up above (left
to right) are Cox, Pat Currier, this week's guest, and To^d.
