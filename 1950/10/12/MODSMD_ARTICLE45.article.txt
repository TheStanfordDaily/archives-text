# Fire Causes On Display
## 
### 
As a special feature of Fire Pre
vention Week, the Bookstore is now
displaying a collection of articles
commonly known to start fires. The
display will continue until Satur
day.
The charred, twisted wiring and
a partly melted electric iron
shown in the window started fires
in campus living groups. The wir
ing was overloaded with five t'lec
tical fixtures attached to it, while
the electric iron had not been
turned off.
Also on display are posters and
photographs of objects which are
weÂ»-known fire-starters.
In advancing a list of fire pre
ventative measures to be taken by
everyone on or off campus, Fire
Chief John Marston put good
housekeeping at the top. Clean liv
ing quarters and grounds will do
more than any other single item to
eliminate fire hazards, he said.
Other methods of fire prevention
recommended were regular inspec
tion of chimneys, use of correct
fuses, avoiding misuse of inflam
mables, and precaution against
overloading electrical circuits.
Commenting on amateur "iixits,"
Marston said any changes or addi
tions to electrical circuits should
not be done with pliers and screw
drivers. A qualified electrician
should be called in to do the job, the
fire chief concluded.
