## Cardinals Sweat Out Theme, 'Axe' Slogan for Big Game 
### 
Cardinals did some tall thinking Tuesday night and after a two
hour skull session came out of the smoke-blue haze of the Excom
room with a theme and slogan for Big Game.
"Thanksgiving Injun out for BIG GAME," suggested by Steve
Barnett, was the theme finally chosen for the Friday night float

parade, Nov. 24. ,
For a Big Game slogan, Cardinals
went 'round and 'round before de
ciding on "Bear Devastation Brings |
Axe Celebration."
"We believe this combination of j
theme and slogan is general enough |
to provide unlimited ideas for i
floats, and yet is specific enough to ,
connect Big Game with Thanksgiv- !
ing and vacation motifs," Ted Hin- |
shaw, Cardinals president, said.
The general theme on the Berke
ley campus this year will be "UC j
Our Golden Future."
Routine business was rapidly dis- !
posed of before Cardinals busied j
itself over consideration of the i
theme and slogan.
