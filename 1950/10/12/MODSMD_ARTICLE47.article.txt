# Two Foreign Films Fall Below Average

### ROY HEMMING 
The talents of a great French
movie-maker on the decline and a
rising Italian director in his early
stages of development are being
shown together this week at San
Francisco's State Theater: Jacques
Feyder's "Back Streets of Paris"
and Giuseppe di Santis' "Woman
Hunt."
The Feyder film, originally called
"Macadam" in France, is certainly

no match for
such earlier
works of his as
"Carnival in
Flanders" or
"Poi trait of a
Woman" â€” even
though it has

the same excellent star as the oth
ers in Feyder's wife, Franqoise Ro
say. She turns in, as always, an in
teresting performance as a shady
Parisian hotel-keeper who keeps
trying to "acquire" a briefcase full
of francs from an old friend who
manages to get out of jail every
time she frames him into one.
Weak Material
But neither the Rosay perform
ance, nor the presence of Simone
Signoret as a particularly wayward
wfcnch, nor the "blunt realism"
technique of photography can raise
the trivial material into anything
even remotely resembling the qual
ity usually forthcoming from a
Feyder-Rosay collaboration. It's a
particular shame since Feyder's
death last year means that his only
postwar effort showed him in weak
form.
"Woman Hunt" (or as it was
called in its Eastern showings,
"Tragic Hunt") is the work of writ
er-director Giuseppe di Santis and
is in the neo-realistic manner of
such postwar Italians as di Sica,
Zampa, and Rosselini.
New Talent
As in his more recent "Bitter
Rice," di Santis throws in a good
deal of sociological commentary on
agrarian reforms to give a new
slant to some conventional melo
dramatics. Although the device
frequency shows its shallow seams,
the picture nonetheless reveals a
provocative new film talent from
which even more worthwhile work
can be expected.
The story of "Woman Hunt" con

cerns a group of peasants whose
government subsidy money is sto
len by a gang of ex-Fascists and
how the peasants organize to re
trieve their loss. Massimo Girotti,
the current Italian heart - throb,
spearheads the peasant activity.
