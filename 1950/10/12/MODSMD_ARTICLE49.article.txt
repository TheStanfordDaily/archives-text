While this is being written, Stanford boxing coach Ray Lunny is under
going the rigors of a Navy physical exam at Treasure Island. If the blue
jacket medicos find Lunny a fit specimen of American manhood, and there's
no reason to believe they won't, the dapper lightweight aspirant will be
sworn into active duty immediately. And Stanford's Athletic Department
will simultaneously lose one of its most colorful and well-liked member.?.
Whether or not Hay is accepted for Naval service, the time is ripe for
a few words of tribute to u man who has gained lite respect and admira
tion of all who knew him during his three-year tenure as mentor of the
Farm beak-busters. A man who has spent the better part of his life in
one of the toughest, most looked-down-on professions of our society, but
whose capabilities and character prompted Don Liehendorfcr to describe
him yesterday as a "fine person, a »rand coach, and a valued member of
• lie coaching staff."
Liebendorfer went on to say, "I know that I speak the sincere sentiments
of the whole staff in saying that we very much regret losing Ray and that
we look forward with pleasure to his return."
You've heard so many times the old bromide about sportsmanship being
more important than winning games that I won't press the subject in regard
to Lunny's coaching. It is sufficient to say that, although his teams never
set the world afire, none of the boys who served under him failed to gain
something from his training. And that something was a judiciously propor
tioned combination of ring wisdom, will to win, and those personal charac
teristics which we group under the head of "sportsmanship."
In further regard to his coaching record, it is well to remember that Stan
ford's potentialities in the sport ure hardly of the highest order; in spite of
this, Lunny's teams usually managed to win as many as they lost.
Hay was a fiery and colorful performer during his fighting days,
which came to an untimely end in 1943 when bad hands forced bis
retirement from the ring. And the energy which carried him to the Cali
fornia state lightweight championship and contention for the world title
is still apparent in his alert, quick-motioned mannerisms.
Otherwise, Ray bears little resemblance to the popular conception of a
"demand dose guy" (to quote his own expression). In fact, his greatest fear
is that people might judge him by their pre-conceived notions concerning
the fight game and its members.
J recall an instance when, in a story concerning the boxing team, I un
thinkingly inserted the word "damn" into a quotation from Ray in order to
color the statement for journalistic purposes. Ray read the story at 8. had
me on the phone at 8:02, and had extracted my promise of more accurate
reporting by 8:04. " You made me sound just like a "demand dose guy',"
lie complained.
More accurately, Kay Lunny is a grand guy. One of whom Stanford
has been justifiiably proud. And one who leaves behind Itiin a mighty
large collection of friends and admirers.
