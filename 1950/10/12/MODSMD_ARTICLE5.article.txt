LONDON, Thursday, Oct. 12 â€”
Russian Premier Josef Stalin
wished the North Koreans success
today in their "struggle for inde
pendence" as United Nations forces
battered their way north of the 38th
parallel in a drive on the North
Korean capital.
Stalin addressed his message to
North Korean Premier Kim II Sung
who has ignored Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur's "last" surrender demand
and ordered his Communist troops
to fight to the finish against the
United Nations forces.
