# Cards Prep For Broncos
## 
### 
Stanford's offensive and defensive
varsity units went through an ex
tended speed workout last night in
preparation for Saturday's Stadium
battle with Santa Clara.
Jack Rye, stellar defensive end,
missed the mid-week practice be
cause of a heavy cold which placed
him in the Rest Home yesterday. It
is hoped, however, that Rye will be
ready for the Broncos Saturday.
Fullback Chuck Essegian, guard
Norm Manoogian, and fullback Wes
Laubscher were limited to jogging
around the practice field yesterday.
Essegian, who has a pulled back
muscle, and Laubscher, who slight
ly injured his knee in practice
Tuesday, will probably be ready to
see action against Santa Clara.
However, Manoogian, who is sup
porting a knee brace, will probably
miss Saturday's game.
