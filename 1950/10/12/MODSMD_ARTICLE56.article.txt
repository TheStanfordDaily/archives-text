# Frosh Gridders Prepare for Bronco Opener
## 
### 
The curtain rings up on the Stan
ford frosh football season this Sat
urday when Coach Bob Ghilotti
will unveil his 1950 team against
the Santa Clara yearlings. The
game will be the 11 a.m. prelimi
nary for the varsity struggle.
Stanford freshman teams have
gone three years in a row without
a defeat, but may be hard pressed
this year to beat the Bronco Colts,

who are reputed to have a good
team. Santa Clara's line averages
over 200 pounds a man and will
outweigh the Indian forwards.
