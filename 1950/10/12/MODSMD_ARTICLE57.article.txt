THIRTY-FIVE ATO'S NOSES wrinkled last night when Peaches
111, the porker that's been running around campus advertising
the Hog Wallow, was discovered last night on the house's sleep
ing porch. The potential ham —unseen, unheard, but smelled
—was sneaked onto the porch soon after the boys had gone to
bed by the two ATO's who had greased him with bacon grease.
A late ancestor of Peaches, who is now probably reduced to
sausage and bacon, is shown above.
