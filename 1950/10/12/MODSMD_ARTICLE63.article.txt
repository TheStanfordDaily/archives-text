"The Preachcr and the Slave," a
new novel by Wallace Stegner, pro
fessor of English, has recently been
published by the Houghton Mifflin
Company of Boston.
The book tells the story of Joe
Hill, a leader of laboring men in
the days when unions were first or
ganizing, and the legend which
grew up after his execution in the
International Workers of the World.
Stegner believes -- that probably
neither the reactionary Right nor
the partisan Left will thoroughly
approve the portrait he has drawn
of Joe Hill. What be hoped to do in
the book was to pose in dramatic
terms the quarrel between the way
of violence and the way of peace.
Stegner, who is director of the
Stanford Writing Center, is now on
his way to India, the Philippines,
and Japan, on a Rockefeller Foun
dation grant, to discuss contempo
rary American writing with literary
groups in those countries.
