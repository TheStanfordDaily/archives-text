## Truman-MacArthur to Discuss Korea 
### 
FAIRFIELD-SUISUN AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., Oct. 12 (UP)â€”President
Truman arrived here tonight cn route on a flying trip to a Wake Island
conference with Gen. Douglas Mac-Arthur on the clean-up of the Korean
campaign and methods of halting further Communist aggression in the Far
East.
The Chief Executive was intent on what he hopes will be "some contribu
tion to the peace of the world."
Informed sources in Washington, however, said his trip coincides with a
"serious" military situation in Indo-China where Communists have won
important military victories over French colonial forces.
At the same time, informants in Tokyo said Mac-Arthur is expected to
urge the President to "draw the line" against Communist aggression in the
Far East.
MacAt thur is said to feel that the United States must prevent Indo-China,
Formosa, arid other non-Communist areas fiom falling into the Red orbit.
