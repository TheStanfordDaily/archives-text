# 18-Year-Old Draft Seen; Medics Hit by New Law
## 
### 
WASHiNGTON, Oct. 12 (UP)â€”Maj. Gen. Lev/is B. Hershey, na- 1
tional Selective Service director, said today the question of asking
Congress to lower the draft age to 18 is being "seriously con-1

' ldered.
He made the statement soon after
President Trumna issued strict new
draft regulations for doctors, den
tists, and veterinarians. They are
aimed to guarantee minimum health
standards for civilians and put
younger medics in uniform first.
In a speech before the Washington
chapter of the American Veterans
Committee, Hershey said World War
II veterans could be "wholly" ex
cepted if draft boards were allowed
to tap the "very rich source of man
power" represented by 18-year-olds.
Under present draft regulations,
men 18 through 25 must register for
the draft but only those 19 or above
may be inducted.
Ecprmamcnt Rate Inadequate
Gen. Omar N. Bradley warned to
night that the rate of rearmament is
inadequate and that his joint chiefs
of staff soon will hand President Tru
man a stepped-up mobilization plan.
Bradley, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs, appeared on Columbia Broad
casting System's radio program, "One
Nation Indivisible.'' He said the
threat posed by Communist aggres
sion will require more men and
money than present plans call for.
Korea Taxed War Resources
He said the "local war" in Korea
taxed this country's then existing
military resources to the breaking
point. He added that Congress has
provided for vastly larger armed
forces since then, but even they
would not be enough to cope with a
major Red assault.
