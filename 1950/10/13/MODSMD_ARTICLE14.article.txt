## Hugasian or Griffin to Start at Fullback, Schwartz Says; Santa Clarans Plagued by Injuries, Coach Invalided 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Santa Clara s youthful uroncos, who are still seeking their first 1950 gridiron victory, will enter
Stanford Stadium tomorrow as 21-point underdogs when they clash with Coach Marchie Schwartz 3
undefeated Indians.
This year s injury-riddled Santa Clara eleven, w.th only two veterans in the starting lineup, *s a far
cry from the loaded 1949 Orange Bowl aggregation that rallied to tie Stanford 7 to 7.

And to make matters worse for the
Bronco cause, S nt.a Clara's new head
coach, Dick Gallagher, lias been out
ior two weeks with a serious thy
roid ailment.
Nevertheless. Stanford, who hasn't
come back with a Bronc scalp since
l!,4f>, will not be taking the tradi
tional game lightly.
Coach Schwartz, who has had full
back injury problems all week, an
nounced yesterday that either Bob
Griffin or Harry Hu-jasian would get
the starting call at the all-important
fullback sf.ot.
Hugasian Shifts
Soph fullbacks Chuck Essegian and
Wfcs Laubscher missed practice this
past week, which necessitated the
.hifting of Hugasian over from his
usual left half position.
Essegian is recovering from a
strained back, while Laubscher is
out temporarily with a banged-up
knee.
Rugged first .string guard, Owen
Powell, who received a knee injury
similar to that of Norm Manoogian
in practice Wednesday, won't see ac
tion tomorrow. Ron Garner, a stal
wart 201-pound JC transfer, will
start in Powell's place.
Rye Has Cold
Slated for limited action only
against Santa Clara is defensive ace
Jack Rye, who is recovering from a
severe cold. Rye, who has been mak
ing more tackles every Saturday, did
not suit up for practice during the
latter part of the week.
Heading the Santa Clara injury
list are guards John Justice and Joe
Ramona. The Broncos are extremely
weak in the center of the line, and
the two guard losses will hurt them
severely.
Ready and raring for an upset are
veteran quarterback John Pasco and
fullback Saxon Wraith, both of whom
started against the Indians last year.
If Pasco's passes start clicking, the
dormant Bronco offense might begin
to realize its potential.
140-Pound Half
In addition, the Broncos have
scrappy Marte Formico, a 140-pound
right half, the lightest gridder on the
Pacific Coast. Formico is tops on de
tense.
Rounding out the Santa Clara
backfield will be left half Ron Vogel,
who like Wraith, is a powerful run
ner.
For Stanford, T formation general
Gary Kerkorian will again lead the
attack with left half Boyd Benson
and right half Bob White doing most
of the pigskin carrying.
McColl A Linebacker
Ends Bill McColl and Bruce Van
Alstyne of the Indians are slated for
defensive linebacking duty as well as
pass snagging. Both men played a
great defensive game against Oregon
State last Saturday, and will play a
full 60 minutes tomorrow if neces
sary.
At the defensive halfback position,
Schwartz may choose between Hu
gasian, White, Joe St. Geme, and Bob
Meyers, all of whom contributed
greatly to the Beaver shutout.
Soph Skip Crist also gained valu
able experience as a linebacker last
Saturday and may again get the call
this week. *

Coach Schwartz, who has had full
back injury problems all week, an
nounced yesterday that either Bob
Griffin or Harry Hu-jasian would get
the starting call at the all-important
fullback sf.ot.
Hugasian Shifts
Soph fullbacks Chuck Essegian and
Wfcs Laubscher missed practice this
past week, which necessitated the
.hifting of Hugasian over from his
usual left half position.
Essegian is recovering from a
strained back, while Laubscher is
out temporarily with a banged-up
knee.
Rugged first .string guard, Owen
Powell, who received a knee injury
similar to that of Norm Manoogian
in practice Wednesday, won't see ac
tion tomorrow. Ron Garner, a stal
wart 201-pound JC transfer, will
start in Powell's place.
Rye Has Cold
Slated for limited action only
against Santa Clara is defensive ace
Jack Rye, who is recovering from a
severe cold. Rye, who has been mak
ing more tackles every Saturday, did
not suit up for practice during the
latter part of the week.
Heading the Santa Clara injury
list are guards John Justice and Joe
Ramona. The Broncos are extremely
weak in the center of the line, and
the two guard losses will hurt them
severely.
Ready and raring for an upset are
veteran quarterback John Pasco and
fullback Saxon Wraith, both of whom
started against the Indians last year.
If Pasco's passes start clicking, the
dormant Bronco offense might begin
to realize its potential.
140-Pound Half
In addition, the Broncos have
scrappy Marte Formico, a 140-pound
right half, the lightest gridder on the
Pacific Coast. Formico is tops on de
tense.
Rounding out the Santa Clara
backfield will be left half Ron Vogel,
who like Wraith, is a powerful run
ner.
For Stanford, T formation general
Gary Kerkorian will again lead the
attack with left half Boyd Benson
and right half Bob White doing most
of the pigskin carrying.
McColl A Linebacker
Ends Bill McColl and Bruce Van
Alstyne of the Indians are slated for
defensive linebacking duty as well as
pass snagging. Both men played a
great defensive game against Oregon
State last Saturday, and will play a
full 60 minutes tomorrow if neces
sary.
At the defensive halfback position,
Schwartz may choose between Hu
gasian, White, Joe St. Geme, and Bob
Meyers, all of whom contributed
greatly to the Beaver shutout.
Soph Skip Crist also gained valu
able experience as a linebacker last
Saturday and may again get the call
this week. *
