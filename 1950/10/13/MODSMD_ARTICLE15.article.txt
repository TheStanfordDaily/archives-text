# Stanford Injun Gets New Name--Li'l Ugh
## 
### 
Li 1 Ugh is the new, formal, and official name for Stanford's two
week-old mascot, which is set to perform before the grid fans the
rest of the season.
A committee of Rally Com members, after deliberating over al
most 50 names until midnight last night, finally chose the name

submitted by Nancy Ei win, Lagunita.
The name replaces the temporary
title, "Li'l Injun."
Miss Lrwin will win Ivvo goner*l
admission tickets to the Army game
for her winning entry.
Besides wearing a new name for
tomorrow's game, the mascot will
also be attired in a now costume,
which may or not be permanent.
| Beneath the old plaster of Paris head,
which will see its !■ ,t action tomor
row, the Indian will sport a white
shirt with a large red S on the front
and back and white slacks with red
■ringe on the sides and cutis. Chris
Carr has designed and made the cos
tume.
"We will trade in hLs old head for a
new one by the UCLA game," Hen
derson said. His face will bo on the
order of a caricature and will be
topped by real (hemp) hair instead
of mere black paint. In place of the
plaster of Paris complexion, the nnw
lace will be made of papier-mache.
Henderson said it was a case of
cither getting a new head or finding
a different student to perform under
the old head each Saturday.
He explained that the plaster of
aPris had melted during the USF
?ame, dripped down on the late "Li'l
injun s' real face, and dried there.
The mascot, by then quite a paleface,
was unable to open his mouth and
becamc thirsty. It took the com
bined efforts of all the yell leaders
to force some water between the In
dian's chalked lips to to finally re
nove the plaster.
