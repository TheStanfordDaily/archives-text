TOKYO, Friday, Oct. 13 (LP)â€”
South Korean ground forces have
driven to the outskirts of Ichon, 34
air miles north of the 38th parallel
and 12 miles beyond their last re
ported position, the Far East Air
Force said today.
Naval forces have softened up
North Korean defenses with an ar
mada of 37 ships which poured
hundreds of tons of shells itno the
port of Chongjin, 49 miles from
Russia.
The battleship Missouri led the
bombardment of Chongjin, which
was the biggest east coast naval
strike since the start of the war.
The gigantic naval strike was
made as U.S. troops drove north
ward from the 38th parallel to with
in f>s miles of the North Korean
capita! of Pyongyang.
The strike was the northernmost
naval attack "in force" since the
North Koreans opened the invasion
on June 25. It was of the devastat
ion type which might precede an
amphibious invasion.
