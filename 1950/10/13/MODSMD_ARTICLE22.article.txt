# A
						Dramatic Right Arm
## 
### 
With the passing of new by-laws for Ram's
Head Board this week, Stanford students have
another right arm available. Ram's Head is
nciw more than just an honorary club estab
lished only for the benefit of a select group
of ? tirama students.
Since last March, the group has been classi
fied as one of the administrative boards under
thfe jurisdiction of the ASSU and the Executive
Committee.
For the first time Ram s Head is now ready
to serve the students in advisory, technical, or
directorial capacities. Drama specialists will
help classes, organizations, or living groups
plan special assemblies, talent shows, and
many forms of skits.
Chief addition to the administrative board is
the Reviewing Committee, composed of three
voting members elected by the Ram's Head
Board.
Undc-r the by-law any group desiring to pro
duce a theatrical or dramatic production must
petition to the Reviewing Committee just as
ihey did to the ASSU vice-president in times
past. If the petition is disapproved, the group
can extend their plea to Excom.
A petitioning organization's first tendency is
to look suspiciously at this new reviewing
committee. But the reasons for its formation
are really quite valid. A review of the date,
place, and type of entertainment is necessary
to avoid conflicts with other major dramatic
endeavors on campus and to space similar pro
ductions so the drawing power of each is not
reduced.
In addition to its coordinating function the

group will screen many things which would
come up before the Committee on Public Ex
ercises or the Speech and Drama Department
at a later date.
As a group which is technically proficient,
Ram's Head has the resources and the know
how to make itself useful to the student body
after portioning groups have made known
their dramatic plans.
Groups not associated with drama, such as
the Stanford Band and Rally Com, have already
asked for and received aid or advice from the
board.
With machinery now set up for furthering
ASSU dramatic activities in a much broader
field, the Ram's Head Board becomes even
closer to the student body, than just a group
of actors beyond the orchestra pit.
First, and probably one of the Board's most
important projects, is the completion of a tal
ent file, in which all students trying out for
shows, plays, or skits will list their qualifica
tions in the entertainment field.
Then when organizations need performers
for skits, carnivals, or parties, they can obtain
quick results from the Ram's Head files.
The Debate Board has a duty to the siudent
body to air campus issues. The Concert Series
Board is obliged to present prominent musical
artists on campus. The Activities Board has a
responsibility for feeling the pulse of social
trends on campus and encouraging more on
campus parties.
To complete the picture, Ram's Head now
takes on a role of promoting and coordinating
dramatic activity on the Farm.
