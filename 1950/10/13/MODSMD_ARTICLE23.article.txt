# CAMPUS OPINION
## From One Who Knows A 						Poet's Version 
### 
To: Lisa Thacker, c/o Daily
Stanford, California
Dear Miss Thacker:
1 read your letter in yesterday's Daily with mixed
feelings. I quite agree with you that Palmieri is a
shmoe, and I am just as sick and tired as you are of
hearing and reading about Stanford "pigs."
Having once visited the campus, in fact, as a guest
of the ATO's, I have seen Stanford women, and they
definitely don't deserve the name of "pigs." Please
know that I am contacting the legal counsel of SPCA
and recommending that we file suit against the Daily
for slander.
Hoping we can stop this ruttin' business,
Very truly yours,
HENRIETTA 111

To "Dutch Uncle" Palmieri:
VERSE I
There's highland Dutch and lowland Dutch,
But Stanford Women know
Palmieri quotes the Dutch too much,
Highland . . . ? lieck, he's low!
VEKSE II
He insults us coeds.
Claims we're all a mess.
If this guy wants a checkmate,
He can go play chess.

(Editor's Note.—After several years (if debate in
the columns of this paper, the Daily now considers
the problem of Stanford men, women, pigs, and
hoars a sullied of the past. Let ail rest in peace.)
