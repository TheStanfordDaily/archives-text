Students are not conscious of the
fact that many things thev do are
part of Stanford public relations, said
Frederic O. Glovei, University di
rector of information, Wednesday
night.
Talking at a meeting of men's and
women's Row social chairmen at the
Sigma Chi House, Glover declared,
"Students are an important part of
Stanford public relations. What they
do and say are part of the Univer
sity."
He praised such thin >s as the Stan
lord Crew and the foreign scholar
ship program. "Most students do a
swell job," he explained. "That's why
we sit here and cringe when some
thing happens to throw a bad light on
the student body."
It's the bad things that get the
most publicity, Glover continued. He
said many worthwhile student
achievements are never known be
cause most students don't think of
their actions in relation to Stanford
prestige.
Richard L. Balch, chief counselor
for men, discussed the liquor prob
lem. He urged the men's and wom
en's houses to use mature judgment

j in planning parties, and pointed out
J that liquor regulations 112 are set up
both by the state and the University, i
Balch advised the men's and worn- |
en's Row houses to solve many gf
j their own problems rather than bring
, them to the dean's office. If student
| leaders all did their jobs, he said, his
] would be merely one of "con- J
1 tinuity."'
A permanent association of Row
j social chairmen was formed at the
meeting. The group elected Pete
Baldwin, Phi Delta Theta, president,
j and Mitzi Reichling, Guthrie House,
secretary.
