# Band Plans Welcome for Santa Clara; To Toast 'Frontier Days' Next Week
## 
### GORDON McKIBBEN 
Bands, like football teams, tomo
tims look ahead to big games.
That's what the Stanford band is
doing this week.
With the UCLA game on'y one
Saturday away, the Cardinal musi
cians arc doiii* extra work on
stunts to be presented at half-time
in the Coliseum next week.
Stanford's band will pattern it;
enlire show around the Bruin home
coming theme of "Frontier Days."
Jack Blumberg and Mike Gregg are
handling the stunts, and have
cooked up snappy executions rang
ing from a covered wagon with
moving wheels to a rocking chair—
that rocks!
The Santa Clara battle is not be
ing entirely overlooked because of
the Los Angeles invasion, however.
Gridders, please note.
Tomorrow the bandsmen will try
a radical change in their marching
between halves. They will move
down the turf in diamond forma
tion, and will salute the two schools
by spelling out "Bronco" and "In
juns."
Raucous help will be given by the
rooting sections if plans work out.
The students will shout each letter
of the two names, thus setting off
the signals for the marchers to ma
neuver.

A new twist in loud «'nd brassy
fun fares will bo started, too. Fcrde
Grofe, noted contemporary com
poser, wrote the fanfare to be used
tf moi row whon he was here last
sprint? to conduct his "Aviation
Suit?" at the annual concert.
Direr tor Julius Shuchs.t also
had news about other bands to tell
his men.

er in the Northwest, Glamorous
Gloria, will fly here for the Card-
Husky battle Oct. 28.
The Husky band has never before
appeared in Stanford Stadium, ac
cord ng to old-times on the campus.
The trp was made possible bee?use
last October the Stanford Band flew
to Seattle. This year the Huskies
wanted to return the compliment.
High-steppint, fast-twirling Glo
ria nearly stole the show from the
Card musicians in Seattle last fall.
Seattle sportswriters, headed hy
Roval Brougham of the Post-In
telligencer, have pounded out many
a story about the fabulous major
ette.

Bands, like football teams, tomo
tims look ahead to big games.
That's what the Stanford band is
doing this week.
With the UCLA game on'y one
Saturday away, the Cardinal musi
cians arc doiii* extra work on
stunts to be presented at half-time
in the Coliseum next week.
Stanford's band will pattern it;
enlire show around the Bruin home
coming theme of "Frontier Days."
Jack Blumberg and Mike Gregg are
handling the stunts, and have
cooked up snappy executions rang
ing from a covered wagon with
moving wheels to a rocking chair—
that rocks!
The Santa Clara battle is not be
ing entirely overlooked because of
the Los Angeles invasion, however.
Gridders, please note.
Tomorrow the bandsmen will try
a radical change in their marching
between halves. They will move
down the turf in diamond forma
tion, and will salute the two schools
by spelling out "Bronco" and "In
juns."
Raucous help will be given by the
rooting sections if plans work out.
The students will shout each letter
of the two names, thus setting off
the signals for the marchers to ma
neuver.

A new twist in loud «'nd brassy
fun fares will bo started, too. Fcrde

poser, wrote the fanfare to be used
