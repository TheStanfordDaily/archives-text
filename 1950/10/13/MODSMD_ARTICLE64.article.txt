SAN MATEO, Oct. 12 (UP)â€”An
offer of $100,000 was wired to Ez
zard Charles today to defend his
world heavyweight crown against
light - heavyweight champion Joe
Maxim in San Francisco's Kezar
Stadium on Washington's Birthday,
j Feb. 22.
Promoter William P. Kyne made
the offer in a telegram to Jake
Mintz, Charles' manager.
Charles fought for Kyne last year
here when he defended his NBA
| crown against Pat Valentino before
an indoor crowd of 21,000 in the
San Francisco Cow Palace.
If Charles accepts the terms,
Kyne said he hoped that he would
i be able to sell every seat in the
60,000-capacity stadium.
Jack Kearns, manager of Maxim,
here for a visit, said that the public
j was demanding a fight between his
boy and Charles.
"Maxim hasn't lost a fight since
he was beaten in a split decision by
Charles two years ago," Kearns said.
"In that fight every newspaperman
at the ringside had Maxim ahead
on points.
"I know Maxim can beat Charles
if they meet again."
