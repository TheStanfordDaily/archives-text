## FOOTBALL Training Rundown UCLA 
### 
Coach Henry (Red) Sanders sent
his UCLA Bruins through a light
signal drill yesterday and then
called off practice because of the
heat, 99 degrees.
The taciturn Bruin coach said his
team was ready for its game tonight
in Memorial Coliseum against Illi
nois. Sanders refused to make any
prediction, but said the Bruins
would give a good account of them
selves. '
