NEW YORK, Oct. 12 (UP)—Joe
DiMaggio said today that he might
not be back with the New York
Yankees in 1951.
But he added he probably would
not make up his mind until next
spring.
The great Yankee outfielder also
revealed that he had spoken to owner
Dan Topping in July and August
about the possibility that the 1950
season would be his last.
"I have two different points of
view on next year," DiMaggio said.
"I told Topping in July and August
that 1 didn't know if my aches and
pains could take it another year.
Then I felt like a two-year-old dur
ing the World Series and 1 never
felt better all season than 1 do now."
DiMaggio said he had no plans to
talk with Topping or general man
ager George Weiss about a renewal
of his $100,0U0 contract.
"I'm sure I won't confer with them
about my contract in the immediate
future," he said. "There is nothing
to talk about now as far as 1 can see,"
DiMaggio said he planned to stay
in New York "only a few more days
to complete a series of television pro
grams." He said he would return to
his home in San Francisco after the
Series w»is finished und would remain
there all .winter.
It was understood the Yankee brass
would postpone a salary conference
with Joe until next February. Man
ager Casey Stengel and other Yankee
officials will le in the far west then
to supervise the special "talent
school" at Phoenix, Arizona.
Behind DiMaggio's indecision is
his own desire "to go out while
still on top." DiMaggio has numer
ous contacts in television and radio
and would prefer to jump immedi
ately into that field -rather than
struggle through another season.
