# Stanford Frosh Out to Protect Win Streak Against Santa Clara
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Inheriting a string of 16 straight wins without a defeat, Stan
fords 1950 frosh footballers will try to continue what their prede
cessors started when they lock horns with the Santa Clara frosh
here tomorrow. The 11 a.m. contest will be a preliminary for the
varsity game.
Passing, passing, passing—that's what onlookers can expect

from the Cardbebes tomorrow.
Quarterback Bob Garrett, rated by
Pasadena sports editor Rube Sam
uelscn as the best Southland prospect
since Army's Glenn Davis and Cut's
John Olszewski, knows how to thread
the proverbial needle. Garrett won't
be bashful about cocking his arm
back and throwing things at ends
Sam Morely, Dud Hersehback, Tom
Ilowell, or Harry Fancher, if the lat
ter is recovered from an ankle in
jury.
Top Passing l'air
The :;ix-loot, three-inch Morely, a
teammate o! Garrett's at South Pasa
dena High School, will be the blond
quarterback's favorite target. An
other version of Kerkorian to MeColl,
junior grade.
Garrett will get offensive assistance
from Don Day, a 190-pound fullback
from San Diego's Hoover High;
Bill Scheidecker, a 185-pound end
converted to right halfback from
Analy High School; and Frank Ten
erello, a compact, five-foot, eight
inch, 170-pound power runner from
Chicago at left half. Ron Cook, orig
inally slated for first string left half,
may have to sit the game out with
an injured foot.
Starting lineman for the Papooses
are Morely and Herschback, ends;
Dick Gant and Marshall Howe, tack
les; Jim Ward and Frank Druhati,
guards; and Fran McKenna, center.
In case McKenna can't start, he being
the victim of a bad knee, it will be a
toss-up among Tom Allen, Eric Mack,
and Dick Steere. When the Card
babes switch to defense, Don liar
court will go in at right tackle. Bud
Coon will (ill in at left half, and John
Gilmore will play safety.
Bronc Weight Edge
The Bronco Colts, yet to experience
a postwar win over Stanford, aren't
calculated to roll over and play dea l
when the Cardbabes show up for
game time tomorrow. Santa Clara
v.'ill field a line that averages 204
pounds a man about 1(1 more pounds
of beef per man than the Papooses
can muster.
Quarterback Joe Clark, a former
teammate of Gary Kerkorian at In
glewood High, will pilot the invaders
from his quarterback position. His
key target will be George Mont
gomery, a rangy end from Hawaii.
Left hall Bob Draklich and right hall
Bill Gil are known for their yard
gaining talents.
The game will be broadcast over
KIBE, 1220 on the dial. Handling the
sportcasting will be Ray Hammed,
former Stanford backfield coach,
Funnyman Dean Borba, last year's
unforgettable cheerleader, will do
the color.

The :;ix-loot, three-inch Morely, a
teammate o! Garrett's at South Pasa
dena High School, will be the blond
quarterback's favorite target. An
other version of Kerkorian to MeColl,
junior grade.
Garrett will get offensive assistance
from Don Day, a 190-pound fullback
from San Diego's Hoover High;
Bill Scheidecker, a 185-pound end
converted to right halfback from
Analy High School; and Frank Ten
erello, a compact, five-foot, eight
inch, 170-pound power runner from
Chicago at left half. Ron Cook, orig
inally slated for first string left half,
may have to sit the game out with
an injured foot.
Starting lineman for the Papooses
are Morely and Herschback, ends;
Dick Gant and Marshall Howe, tack
les; Jim Ward and Frank Druhati,
guards; and Fran McKenna, center.
In case McKenna can't start, he being
the victim of a bad knee, it will be a
toss-up among Tom Allen, Eric Mack,
and Dick Steere. When the Card
babes switch to defense, Don liar
court will go in at right tackle. Bud
Coon will (ill in at left half, and John
Gilmore will play safety.
Bronc Weight Edge
The Bronco Colts, yet to experience
a postwar win over Stanford, aren't
calculated to roll over and play dea l
when the Cardbabes show up for
game time tomorrow. Santa Clara
v.'ill field a line that averages 204
pounds a man about 1(1 more pounds
of beef per man than the Papooses
can muster.
Quarterback Joe Clark, a former
teammate of Gary Kerkorian at In
glewood High, will pilot the invaders
from his quarterback position. His
key target will be George Mont
gomery, a rangy end from Hawaii.
Left hall Bob Draklich and right hall
Bill Gil are known for their yard
gaining talents.
The game will be broadcast over
KIBE, 1220 on the dial. Handling the
sportcasting will be Ray Hammed,
former Stanford backfield coach,
Funnyman Dean Borba, last year's
unforgettable cheerleader, will do
the color.
Inheriting a string of 16 straight wins without a defeat, Stan
fords 1950 frosh footballers will try to continue what their prede
cessors started when they lock horns with the Santa Clara frosh
here tomorrow. The 11 a.m. contest will be a preliminary for the
varsity game.
Passing, passing, passing—that's what onlookers can expect

from the Cardbebes tomorrow.
