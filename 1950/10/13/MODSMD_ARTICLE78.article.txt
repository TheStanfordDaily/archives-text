## Nod May Go To Marinos 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 12 (UP)—
Jim Marinos, a third-string quarter
back who can toss a pass with some
thing resembling accuracy, may get
the call to start for the California
Bears in their grid titanic with USC
at Los Angeles Saturday.
Coach Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf
can't say who his starter will be, but
it is known that he is dissatisfied
with the aerial results compiled by
Brent Ogden and Dick Lee.
The tip-off comes with the an
nouncement that Marinos, who has
seen very little action so far this
year, will be captain of the team for
the battle against the Trojans.
Passing's A Joke
Last week against Pertn the aerial
attack against the Quakers was so
ineffective that the fans laughed—
and Coach George Munger pulled in
all his pass defenders to plug the
line in the second half. The result
was that the Easterners held Cali
fornia scoreless in the third and
fourth quarters.
It Coach Jell Cravath of USC has
any visions of doing that too, then
Waldorf may be prepared by sending
in Marinos to toss a few aerials.
The Bears have the men to catch,
the tosses if they go in the right di
rection. They also have three of the
finest running backs in captivity in
Jim Monachino, Johnny Olszewski
and Pete Schabarum.
As a result, they enter the fray
against the Trojans seven to eight
points favorites.
Has SC Jelled?
El Trojan has played eight quar
ters of football this year—and in oidy
one period did the team look like it
would live up to its potentialities.
That was against Washington State
in Pullman last week. Trailing, 0 to
20, quarterback Slick Giffiord piloted
the team to three touchdowns and a
final 20 to 20 tie in the last period.
"Maybe that's when the team
jelled," says Waldorf. "And it may
be we are in for a very tough after
noon. I rate the game a toss-up."
