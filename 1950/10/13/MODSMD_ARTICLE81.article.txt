# Santa Clara Faces Dismal Season
## Broncs Winless In Three Games 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Only two returning starters form
the nucleus of Headman Dick Galla
gher's 11)50 Santa Clara grid squad
for what promises to be the Broncos'
sorriest stason in many a year.
Gallagher came from the Cleve
land Browns this season and devel
oped an almost completely new
squad, but the lower Peninsula
eleven has suffered three consecutive
defeats to date. Last Saturday they
were downed, 14 to 10, by San Jose
State. This reversal of form has
clumped the lid of pessimism over
the Bronc camp.
Consider also the fact that Galla
gher will be absent from the bench ,
for the second week in a row, due to
a serious thyroid gland condition, |
and you have the essence of Santa j
Clara's .sad plight.
I'usco and Wraith
What little experienced talent re
mains is concentrated in the back- (
field, including quarterback John !
Pasco and fullback Saxon Wraith, the j
two starters from the 1949 team. \
Pasco does the parsing, Wraith the
plunging.
Other mcnogrammed backs are j
Abe Dung, the Hawaiian flash who
switched from halfback to quarter
back this year; left half Bernie Vo- j
gel; Len Napolitano, another quar
terback; and right hall's Del Rasmus- I
sen and Marte Formico. These per- I
formers, particularly Dung, have '
been known to display spurts of j
brilliance in the past; but none of i
them have been able to adequately j
fill the one big gap left by gradua- |
tion—the left halfback slot vacated 1
by the fabulous foot. Hall Haynes.
Haynes, Record Punter
Haynes twice shattered existing i
national punting marks and was a j
great all-around performer for Santa
Clara until his sheepskin came J
through last year.
Dung has assumed the punting du- j
ties and will also be utilized as de- ;
tensive safety man.
Gallagher's forward wall isn't even
one-deep with returning squadmen. |
Probably the outstanding lineman is |
"Ready Eddie" Rotticci, who is a cen
ter and net a wine. Eddie is only a 1
junior, but he showed to good ad- j
vantage in the Orange Bowl last year
and has turned in some vicious per
formances this season.
Incidc ntally, Santa Clara uses the ;
platoon system; their publicity re
leases li. t both an offensive and a
defensive eleven. But there's a hitch
—only one position differs between
the two lineup.:: quarterback, where
Dung is officially first string defense
and Pasco the offensive starter.


HARD-DRIVING SAXON WRAITH, Santa Clara fullback and
one of the two returning first-string lettermen on the Bronco
team, prepares for the Cards. In last year's 7 to 7 debacle, his
power thrusts and vicious line backing were a continual thorn
in the side of the Indians.
