Three important rule changes, if
noted, will greatly enhance the
spectators' view of the game t'lis

scored much as in basketballâ€”four,
and the offending player is ejected
from the game.
(2) When t";e referee blows his
whistle for a personal or technical
foul, all the players except those
involved in the offense may keep
moving; formerly all motion ceased.
(3) No man may attempt a shot
from within the four-yard line un
less he dribbles the ball in; under
the old rule, (he limit was (he two
yard line.
