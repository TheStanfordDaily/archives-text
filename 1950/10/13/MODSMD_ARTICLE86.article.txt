# SAE, Fijis Outscore Betas, Chi Psi in Mural Football
## 
### 
Starting their intramural season
on the right foot, tne Fiji I's and the
SAE I's toppled their opening op
ponents yesterday, as the Chi Psi's
fell before "the Fiji's, 7 to 6, while
the SAE's outscored the Beta's, 13
to 6.
The first game was dominated by
passing, with both teams scoring on
long passes. The Chi Psi's taliied
first when Bud Warner passed to
Jack Golenor on a play good for 54
yards. The conversion attempt failed
when Warner's pass was completed
out of the end zone.
The Fiji's struck back just before
the end of the first half when Bob
Mathias snagged a pass from Mike
Murphy and outsped the secondary
to the goal line. Then Mathias
switched roles and passed to Mark
Scott for the game-winning conver
sion. Neither team threatened se
riously in the second half as both of
fenses bogged down cn fumbles and
incompleted passes and the game
ended, 7 to G.
Some dazzling offensive playing by
the SAE's was displayed in the 5
o'clock battle. The victors were
sparked by the bullet passing and
sprinting of tailback Frank Casella,
who personally accounted for over
190 yards. A Casella to Brett pass
brought the first TD and the extra
point attempt was good when Casella
passed to Darrell Kreitz in the end
zone. Only seconds later, Brett
scored again when he intercepted
Beta tailback A 1 Yates' pass, but the
conversion attempt failed and the
first half ended with the SAE's lead
ing, 13 to 0.
The second half started as the first
had ended and it looked like an SAE
rout was in the making. A touch
down called back because of holding
and another threat stopped on a pass
interception seemed only temporary
delays of another score. The clos
ing minutes, however, found the
Betas playing like a different team
as they scored once on a pass from
Dick Gargiulo to Jack Rivenburgh
and were threatening to score again
just as the game ended.
