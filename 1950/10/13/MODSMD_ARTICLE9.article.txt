# Seminar Hears A-Bomb Talk
## 
### 
High air atomic blasts prove to be
much more destructive than under
water detonations, declared Com
mander H. S. Etter, USN-MC, at a
medical seminar on the "Medical
Aspects of Atomic Warfare" Tues
day afternoon in the Physiology
Building.
First- and second - year medical
students heard the naval radiation
expert describe the conditions of
casualties from blast, thermal ra
diation, and gamma radiation of the
bomb. A movie, "Medical Effects of
the Atomic Bomb," was also shown.
Commander Etter pointed out
that while no contamination of the
bombed area lasts after nine sec
onds following a high air blast, the
blast, heat., and gamma radiation
damage is extensive. This blast pro
vides a maximum destruction.
The underwater blast does little
heat, shock, or immediate radiation
damage, but the water spray con
taminates the area for years. The
commander was a member of the
resurvey crew which studied the
Bikini Atoll a year after the atomic
experiment Ihcre.
