The tires on your car right now may
have cords of Cordura* High Tenac
ity Rayon yarn. If so, you benefit
from one of the most important con
tributions that Du Pont scientists
have made through the years to the
automotive industry.
"Cordura" High Tenacity Rayon
is comparable to structural steel in
tensile strength. It makes possible
tires that are at once lighter, stronger
and safer than pre-war tires. Unlike
natural fibers, the qualities of this
product of chemical science are al
ways uniform.
UNDIES TO TIRES
At first, rayon was used mainly in
making articlesof clothing. However,
with an improved tire cord in mind,
l)u Pont scientists set out to produce
a tougher rayon than any previously
known. The problem was given to j

skilled team whose members included
organic, physical and analytical
chemists, physicists, and chemical
and mechanical engineers.
One of their first discoveries was
that strength could he increased by
using cotton 1 inters as the source of
cellulose, in place of wood pulp. It
was found, also, that the viscose solu
tion had to be prepared and handled
with extreme care. Perhaps the most
important lesson was one which the
silkworm had taught centuries be
fore: stretching increases strength. The
Du Pont experimenters stretched the
new yarn and made rayon with a ten
sile strength of about 70,000 pounds
to the square inch—more than twice
the strength of textile rayon then
being produced.
TRIED AND PROVED
With the ctM»peration of tire maim

facturcrs, "Cordura" was tested in
heavy-duty tires on baking-hot des
ert roads. During the war it proved
itself on command cars, trucks and
jeeps. Today, rayon-cord tires are
widely used on trucks and buses,
and leading manufacturers use
Du Pont "Cordura" in tires they
make for passenger cars.
The combination of lightness and
strength offered by "Cordura" has
also earned it a welcome from makers
of conveyor belts, V-belts and hose
for domestic, agricultural and indus
trial uses. It is used to reinforce lam
inated kraft paper, to tie wires to
electrical switchboards and as a chain
warp in carpets to bind the wool
tufts firmly in place. One of the
newest uses is in plastic clotheslines.
The Du Pont Company makes none
of these articles. But because
Du Pont scientists had an idea and
the facilities and funds to develop
it, many businesses can nowoffcryou
better products to make life safer and
more enjoyable.
