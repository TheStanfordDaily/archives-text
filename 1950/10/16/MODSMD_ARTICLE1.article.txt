## French Prepare For New Attacks 
### 
SAIGON, French Indo-China, Oct.
15 (IJI*) â€”French ti >ops driven back
with heavy losses from their chain
of fortresses facing Communist China
prepared today for a renewal of the
I fed attacks that have given France
its worst military defeat since World
War If.
In the past month, the Communist
led Indo-Chinese troops have
knocked the French from the 225-
mile defence wall along the Red Chi
nese border. Officials here said that
new Vict Minh blows "may be ex
pected."
Only a path of broken bodies and
broken fortresses now marks what
once were the strongest links in the
French bulwark along the border.
How many French troops died in the
fierce hand-to-hand fighting on the
northern frontier is not yet known.
