# WATERBAGGING
## Stern Man May Lose Use of Eye 
### 
Roy T. Sakai, Stanford stu
dent, is threatened with the loss
of his sight in one eye because
someone threw a water bag Fri
day night.
He was admitted to Palo Alto Hos
pital that night about 8 with cuts
about his right eye and one across
the cornea. Physicians arc doubtful
whether they can save the eye. He
was reported "comfortable" yester
day afternoon.
Sakai and three friends — Ray
Hcimbcck, Don Willivcr, and Brad
ley Dewey—had followed the band
on its way to the Santa Clara rally
down Escondido road to the Beta
House. When they reached Cublw
ley, they decided to return to their
residence, Stern Hall.

Police Chief Gordon Davis asks
(hat any witnesses to the incident,
especially Band members, report
immediately any details they may
remember. He is particularly anx
ious to obtain an accurate descrip
tion of the car from which the
water bag was thrown, the three
cars following, or any of the occu
pants.

I As they walked past (he large
parking lot between 7 and 7:1.">,
four cars came past them going
toward Quad. The lead car had no
lights; so the men yelled "lights"
at it.
The next the four knew, there was
a splash, and they were all liberally
showered. Sakai doubled over,
moaning.
The water hag—later determined
to have been a balloon—hit him
| squarely on the right eye, break
ing the right lens of his glasses and
causing the lacerations.
Sakai's friends helped him back to
Stern and then to Palo Alto Hospital
l emergency room. A clinic specialist
there reported that the cornea of his
I right eye was severely injured.
Hcimbeck identified the lead car
of the four as a 1045) Chevrolet with
a torpedo rear. He thought it was
gray green, but some of the band
members who saw it as it passed
through, said it was blue.
Miss Patricia Davidson, director of
1 Stern Hall, stated that the men at the
i house are "very upset" over the affair
and that they want very badly to do
{ something about it.
According to Hcimbeck. the main
cansensus of opinion anion l : Stern
i residents whs "Why did it have to
I happen to Roy?"
j Hospital officials have allowed no
! visitors except Miss Davidson and
i some of Sakai's close friends, al
though many of the men have been
j in to see him.
A junior from Las Animas, Colo.,
he was active in Stern intramural
football and basketball and house
social affairs.

Roy T. Sakai, Stanford stu
dent, is threatened with the loss
of his sight in one eye because
someone threw a water bag Fri
day night.
He was admitted to Palo Alto Hos
pital that night about 8 with cuts
about his right eye and one across
the cornea. Physicians arc doubtful
whether they can save the eye. He
was reported "comfortable" yester
day afternoon.
Sakai and three friends — Ray
Hcimbcck, Don Willivcr, and Brad
ley Dewey—had followed the band
on its way to the Santa Clara rally
down Escondido road to the Beta
House. When they reached Cublw
ley, they decided to return to their
residence, Stern Hall.

Police Chief Gordon Davis asks
(hat any witnesses to the incident,
especially Band members, report
immediately any details they may
remember. He is particularly anx
ious to obtain an accurate descrip
tion of the car from which the
water bag was thrown, the three
cars following, or any of the occu
pants.

I As they walked past (he large
parking lot between 7 and 7:1.">,
four cars came past them going
toward Quad. The lead car had no
lights; so the men yelled "lights"
at it.
The next the four knew, there was
a splash, and they were all liberally
showered. Sakai doubled over,
moaning.
The water hag—later determined
to have been a balloon—hit him
| squarely on the right eye, break
ing the right lens of his glasses and
causing the lacerations.
Sakai's friends helped him back to
Stern and then to Palo Alto Hospital
l emergency room. A clinic specialist
there reported that the cornea of his
I right eye was severely injured.
Hcimbeck identified the lead car
of the four as a 1045) Chevrolet with
a torpedo rear. He thought it was
gray green, but some of the band
members who saw it as it passed
through, said it was blue.
Miss Patricia Davidson, director of
1 Stern Hall, stated that the men at the
i house are "very upset" over the affair
and that they want very badly to do
{ something about it.
According to Hcimbeck. the main
cansensus of opinion anion l : Stern
i residents whs "Why did it have to
I happen to Roy?"
j Hospital officials have allowed no
! visitors except Miss Davidson and
i some of Sakai's close friends, al
though many of the men have been
j in to see him.
A junior from Las Animas, Colo.,
he was active in Stern intramural
football and basketball and house
social affairs.
