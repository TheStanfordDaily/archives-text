## Vacated Temporary Buildings Will Serve as Labs, Libraries 
### 
Today will be moving day at Stanford as several Administration
officers move into newly remodeled facilities on the Inner Quad.
The move—first of a series which will shift the Daan of Students'
and Registrar's offices out of temporary buildings into three re
modeled Inner Quad buildings—will place the Committee on Pub-

lie Exerciscs, the Placement Service,
and the Student Employment Office
in Building 1, former Law School
Library.
The deans of Humanities and Sci- !
ences and of Graduate Study, who |
were former occupants of Buildinc!
110 but who have had temporary j
quarters during the summer, will
also move into Building 1.
Seraphim Post of the business
offire staff said that this phase of
•he move will be completed by
Wednesday at the latest.
The move of the other offices to
Building 110 (adjoining Memorial
Court) and Building 100 (formerly a
large lecture room used largely for
law classes) will not be made until
reconstruction of the buildings is
completed, which is not expected un
til after Nov. 1.
The remodeling project, which will
cost $225,000, including reroofing, re
