# Geologist Speaks On Tests Proving Recent Hypothesis
## 
### 
A possible answer to one of the
mysteries of why oi! accumulates in
some areas and does not in others
will be given today at Stanford in
a talk before the School of Mineral
Sciences Journal Club.
The speaker, G. A. Hill, who is
working toward a doctoral degree
in geology, will outline a hypothesis
he has recently developed on the
mechanism of petroleum migration
in sediments, how oil particles
move within sand grains, and what
makes it possible for them to do so.
The lecture will be delivered at
4:15 p.m. in Room 320 of the Geol
ogy Building.
Mr. Hill will describe research lie
is doing to test this hypothesis,
which may throw new light on a
subject of which little is known.
