# An Expanding Farm
## 
### 
The Administration announced recently that
they have engaged a planning engineering firm
to advise the University on plans to develop
Stanford land. The action means that Stanford
is ready to develop plans tliat have been in the
minds of its officials for many years. It also
means that one of the last great land holdings
on the Peninsula is giving way to the march of
civilization.
The University will move slowly and care
fully in its development project. The fact that
engineers have been employed to get devel
opment plans rolling does not mean that steam
shovels and bulldozers are going to begin dig
ging into the rolling foothills tomorrow.
There is much to be done before the first de
velopment begins â€” planning that may take
three or four years. Engineers, planning com
missions, landscapers, and just plain citizens
must be consulted. The University wants to
make the new development as satisfying as
possible to the Peninsula community.
The stress in the development will be on resi
dential subdivision carefully laid out and exe
cuted. Just how the land will be leased or
rented has yet to be decided. A few units of
light industry in the development will be con
fined to the highway, where noiseless, smoke
less and inoffensive units will be constructed
on attractive locations.
1 he announcement of the University's plans
may have come as a disappointment to Stan
ford's friends who have come to love the vast

openness of the unpopulated University lands.
Nevertheless, these 7,000 acres constitute one
ot the University's most valuable assets, and if
would be senseless to allow them to lie idle
when the need for expanding room is so great
around us.
These persons may be consoled in knowing
that every attempt will be made by the Univer
sity to retain the natural beauty surrounding the
campus, while building it into a useful com
munity. A.M.
