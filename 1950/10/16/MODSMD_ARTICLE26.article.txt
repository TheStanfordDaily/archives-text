# Let's Think First
## 
### 
Roy Sakai, a Stanford junior, is in the Palo
Alto Hospital today waiting to learn if he will
lose the sight of one eye, when he should be
worrying over nothing more serious than his
next midterm.
The persons who waterbagged Roy from
their automobile Friday night did not think of
the possible consequences. The driver of that
car would never have thought of ramming his
automobile into Roy's bicycle for a joke; but his
unthinking prank has injured Roy just as seri
ously.
We do not ask Stanford students to stop hav
ing fun. But there is a time to rip up the goal
posts on the football field and a time to weigh
the consequences of a prank. We only ask the
Stanford students to differentiate between
these two situations. â€”A.M.L.
