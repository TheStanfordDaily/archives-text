# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
Stanford women certainly did themselves proud
with the Row Carnival Friday night. It was far and
away the best since the war. Of course we haven't
had many Row Carnivals since the Korean war started,

tut I'm proud of the girls none
theless.
What impressed me most was
the way every single girl on the
Row pitched in to make the thing
a success. In fact, I've never seen
women work harder to spend their
dates' money in my life. But I
didn't mind, because it was all for
such a good cause . . . after all,
there isn't actually any reason
...1... U„ .1 IJ_U

why every Row woman shouldn't have a new cash
mere.
Mr. Winbigler's auction was the hit of the evening
though. Especially with my girl. But I did think she
£ot a little carried away when she donated my car . . .
what difference did 10 bucks make, one way or the
other?
1 understand, however, the affair could have made
a lot more money, but the Dean's wile wouldn't let
Madrono buy him.
Lathrop's revue was as fast and funny a show as
I ever hope to see. ! understand they had four per
formances during the evening and packed the house
for every one. Of course, it was probably only a
drop in the bucket compared to Russell's contribu
tion . . . what with two di.ne telescopes in the house
and fraternity houses on either side.
Yeah it was a fine evening . . . too bad the next
afternoon didn't measure up. For four years now I've
been praying for the day when Stanford would up and
hang one on Santa Clara to the tune of 50 or 60 points.
In fact, even as the "hoopla" spirit began to die in me
along about my sophomore year, and I had trouble
getting excited about one game after the other, my
passion to beat Santa Clara never waned.
Now it looks like I've had it permanently as far as
ever seeing the Big Red ever really stomp on our
little friends from down the Peninsula, and I may as
well tell why it's such a heartbreaker.
Way back in the Dark Ages when I was a fresh
man at Encina things got pretty wild around football
season. We didn't have non-aggression pacts with all
our nvals then and it was the custom to muss up each
other's campus the night before the game.
Well, the night before the Santa Clara game we

came out of the dining hall alter dinner to find a hi#
SC blazing brightly on the lawn in front of Encina
. . . and being pretty clever little rascals we figured
it wat Bronco dirtywork, if you know what I mean.
Before you could say Johnny Olszewski lliere
were Stanford cars gunning down the highway,
loaded with red hot freshmen and gallons of paint.
And ytah, I was in one of those cars.
It didn't take us long after we arrived at Santa
Clara to find out that they were waiting for us in a
big way ... in fact, we made a rush at one of the
gates and got a barrage of boulders between the eyes.
We regrouped and found our strength had dwindled
. . . every car except ours had taken off for Stanford.
We weren't built like heroes so we climbed in and
headed home too, but then fate struck.
As we drove past the Santa Clara campus along a
dark little side street, we spotted a break in the high
shrubbery that looked like a perfect setup for a quick
sortie.
I remember Wes Fry handing me the paint bucket
and taking the brush himself ... I asked him if he
didn't think he had too much to carry . . . and the
two of us inching our way through the shrubbery
toward a beautiful white building a few yards inside
that was just crying to have STANFORD painted in
big red letters on its side.
I also remember prying off the lid of the paint can
and hearing someone ask if I was enjoying myself,
and watching Wes do as pretty a piece of broken field
running through that crowd of Santa Clara boys as
you'd ever hope to see, and 1 remember the surprised
look on their faces when 1 let them have it with a full
gallon of bright red paint . . . but the rest I've tried
awful hard to forget.
Suffice it (o say I got on a Greyhound bus the next
morning at the Santa Clara depot . . . and it was
three months before 1 could appear on campus with
out a turban.
Ever since I've hoped and prayed and waited for
the day we'd slaughter them . . . because, you see,
that JiiM ht I did an awful lot of talking about how
Stanford was going to crucify their so-called football
team the next day . . . and that was in 1947 . . . re
member?
THOUGHT FOR TODAY
Rcmeinher, girls, if you will
For the 25th there'll be a bill . . .
And pity it, mind you, without a peep.
Or else be known us an awful creep.
