Ever since 1933 the German
woman has been told her place
was in the home. With 100
women to every 36 men in the
Germany cf today she will have
to adjust to a new role, and it can
be a decisive role to promote or
retard her country's democratic
development.
Dr. Helga Kreuger, Women's Af
fairs Consultant for the German High
Commissioner, believes her country
women are realists and can learn to
be citizens. However, they are up
against an unemployment total of
1,300,000 and a tradition that gives
preference to men in all forms of
work.
Miss Kreuger has been in this
country for five months studying
methods of vocational placement and
training for women under a pro
gram administered by the U.S. De
partment of Labor Women's Bureau.
She visited the Stanford campus
over the weekend as part of her tour
of United States universities. She
hopes, as a journalist, through radio
and through the women's pages of
newspapers, to relay to the German
women badly needed vocational
guidance.
The need for guidance becomes
greater as woman attorneys through
out Germany militate to reform

clauses in the Civic Code unfavorable
to women. There are clauses con
cerning marriage, family, and work
ing conditions that negate the equal
.'•tatus for women granted in the new
German constitution.
Since the possibility of marriage has
dwindled and the desire for children
has not, German law must one day
account for the legal status of unwed
mothers, Miss Kreuger explained.
She spoke of the provision of hous
ing and children for the single wom
en as major problems in their read
justment to postwar Germany.
Miss Kreuger is more concerned
for the coming generation of German
students than she is for the last.
Even is a high quality of university
professors is achieved, only .00 per
cent of the people can reach the uni
versities. It is on the lower educa
tional levels that teaching is most

influential anil the teachers on this
level were largely reared in the na
tionalistic tradition of militant Ger
many.
She expressed hope in the ex
change of students between contin
nents.
