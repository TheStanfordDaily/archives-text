# CONVERSION BREAKS WIN STREAK
## Santa Clara Frosh Beats Card Papooses, 13 to 14 
### PETE GROTHE 
The margin of a blocked kick snapped a Stanford frosh streak
of 16 games without a defeat as Santa Clara's impertinent yearlings
.squeaked past the Indian frosh, 14 to 13, last Saturday.
As could be expected of an opening game, the contest was
marred by an unceasing string of fumbles and penalties. Fifteen

times the ball slipped from the
grasp of its bearer while the refer
ees' red finery was hugging the
grass most of the game. Yet it was
an exciting game that saw the
Bronco Colts score with cobra-like
suddenness and the Card babes
make their touchdowns with me
thodical, painstaking drives.
Card halfback Frank Tenerello
initiated the second quarter by
scooting from his own 40 to the
Santa Clara 30 for 24 yards gained.
On the next play, however, Santa
Clara end Con Kelly pounced on a
loose Stanford lateral for a Santa
Clara first down on their own 44.
Halfback Billy Gil picked up three,
and on the next play tackle Mar
shall Howe intercepted a Joe Clark
pass to give the Papooses new life
on the Santa Clara 40. This rapid
exchange of the ball was indicative
of the see-saw nature of the game.
Morely Scores
Ron Cook, a real star on Satur
day, swept for 10 yards, aided by
a Captain Marsh Howe block.
Next, Cook picked up four at his
own right tackle, second and 21
yards to go for a TD. Sam More
ly, the rangy end from South
Pasadena, headed straight for the
goal, cut sharply to his left, and
accepted a beautifully timed pass
from quarterback Bob Garrett for
the score.
Garrett tried the conversion,
but guard Sam French broke
through and stopped what would
have been the game-tying point.
With nine minutes remaining in
the second quarter, Santa Clara's
Clark wheeled back to his own 30
and pitched to Gil, who received it
on the Card 30. Gil raced near the
sideline for the remaining yardage.
Phil Russell added the point.
Anderson Breaks Away
The Cardbabes went ahead again
in the third quarter. On the Indian
47, quarterback Doug Collins slip
ped the ball to fullback Bill An
derson who hit off - tackle, followed
his interference nicely, and broke
all the way to the Santa Clara nine.
An off-side penalty took the ball
to the four and Cook, through the
center, added two. Fullback Don
Day. at the same place, cracked for
a foot, and a pitch-out to half Bill
Scheidecker made nothing. Fourth
and two, with the Bronco yearlings
getting very stubborn indeed. On
lourth, however, Cook found day
light at left tackle and pistoled
through for the score. This time,
Garrett added the extra point.
Santa Clara struck quicklike
again as another Clark pass to Gil
carried the ball from the Bronco 40
to the Card 29. On the next play,
Clark hurled to end Ted Connelly
who inched over from the four.
Russell again made the point good,
and that was it.
Cards Have Potential
Actually, the Cards showed
more in defeat than the Broncos
did in victory. Their offense was
more stable, even though it is in
desperate need of timing. They
have the potential, though. Cook
will he a great addition to the
varsity next year, and Scheideck
er is a quick-starting half who
can go all the way at any time.
Garrett showed he liatf the poten
tial and Collins showed he can
piece together a drive. Looking
tremendous in the line were
II owe, M orely, and end John
Steinberg.
Next week it's UCLA and an
other chance.
