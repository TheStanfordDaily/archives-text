# Water Poloists Stop Spartans
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo team
completely overwhelmed a hapless
San Jose State squad Friday after
noon, 8 to 0.
Five men figured in the rout. Er
win Johnson led the way with three
scores in five attempts. Co-captain
Hub Stokely added a pair of coun
ters; and co-captain Don Weeden,
Pete Cole, and Bob Frojen each con
tributed a successful shot.
In the meantime, Jim Gaughram,
with five goals, and Jim Lee, with
four, spearheaded the frosh water
poloists to an 11 to 2 victory over the
San Jose State frosh.
