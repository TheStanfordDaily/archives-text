# Korean Atrocity
## 
### 
YONGHUNG, Korco â€” The muti
lated bodies of more than 500 South
Korean soldiers who were prisoners
of the Communists were found here
on the cast coast today, and a strong
armed scout patrol raced westward
in an attempt to save an estimated
1,000 American GI prisoners from
the same fate.
