# Scarry: McColl All-American!
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Stanford's great aU-purpose end,
Bill McColl, received nothing but
praise from Santa Clara's coaching
staff in the Bronco dressing room
| after Saturday's ckser-than-cx
pected game.
I "McCoii is an Ail-American if
I've ever seen one," remarked as
! sistant coat h Mike Scarry, who was
directing the Bronco forces Satur
day in place of bed-ridden Dick
s Gallagher.
"We tried everything we could
to stop McColl. We even doubled
I up on him part of the time, but he
still caught passes. How are you
going to stop a man like that?"
Scarry praised the efforts of little
142-pound Marte Formico, who had
the impossible task of guarding the
giant Stanford end. "There isn't a
pass defender in the country who
could cover him," Scarry said. As
; for the Broncos, the Santa Clara

coach singled out haltback Jack Kap
lan, who nearly ran the Cards to ;
death, and soph Marv Giegory, who j
played a great defensive game for j
the Broncos at end.
In the Stanford dressing room, I
Coach Marchie Schwartz was very i
much relieved that the game was un- ]
der Stanford's belt. '"Santa Clara was I
tremendously high for the game as
they have been in the past. When
they stopped our first drive, I knew
that we might be in for a rough
afternoon."
Stanford was stopped twice within !
the 5-yard line, "When your op- j
ponent puts on goal line stands like !

that, then you know that they must
be playing good football."
Schwartz admitted that his full
hack problem was far from solved.
"Ilugasian's timing was off, hut
what can you exepct after only
four practices at the new position? "
Bob Griffin ha* the power hut
lacks the necessary speed for
pitchouts. Schwartz remarked
later that sopohomore Boh Myers,
who performed so well in (he
fourth quarter, may be the answer
to the fullback problem.
