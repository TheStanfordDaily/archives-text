### 
BERLIN — More than 12,000,000
East Germans voted today in a forced
single-list election and Communist
officials claimed a 95 per cent turn
out.
The East Germans were escorted to
the polls and told to vote publicly if
they were in favor of peace and
to "go to the booth" if they were
"against peace."
Voters were routed out of their
homes and factories by the hundreds
and herded to the polls by blue
shirted Communist youths. Soviet
soldiers and Soviet-zone police stood
by to watch the balloting.
