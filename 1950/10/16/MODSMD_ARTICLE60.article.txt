# Stanford Wives Are Active In ‘Dames' As Husbands Study
## 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN 
Wives of Stanford students
:an be not only the traditional
Stanford women — but Stanford
Dames as well.
So that these wives of future
Einsteins, lawyers, doctors, and
morticians can get away from it
ill while hubby beats the books,
ihe Stanford Dames were
formed.
While hubby tramps about the
Quad, the Dames are by no means
merely busy caring for Stanford
Rough Jr. or planning meals. They
are busy thinking up activities that
can be carried out in the various sec
tions of their organization: the bridge
group, or the classes in child care
and home arts and crafts.
Of the 1,400 wives of Stanford
students, one-fourth are active Stan
ford Dames. The majority have chil
dren. Many faculty wives also be
long to the club. The organization,
founded in 1921, provides a common
meeting ground outside the wives'
usual routines.
Child Health
One of the Dames' annual practices
is to sponsor a Well-Baby Confer
ence on the first three Wednesdays
of each month. Children of Stanford
students currently enrolled who live
in San Mateo County arc given free
health checu-ups.
The fee for doctor and nurse in
charge of the physicals is donated
by San Mateo County. The Stanford
Dames assist the doctor and raise
money to buy new equipment for
their health service, which is con
ducted at Stanford Village.
Varied Lectures
On their agenda for November is
a fashion show to be sponsored in
conjunction with the Stanford Vil
lage Council.
In the home arts and crafts section,
the women hear lectures on how to
keep up their personal appearance
and lift their gardens' "faces." Lec
tures also deal with cooking and
sewing.
On the social side (when husbands
dodge midterms for party time), the
Dames hold an annual Christmas
party after caroling at the Palo Alto
Hospital. A spring dinner dance and
firesides are also on their social cal
endar.
Monthly Meetings
The Dames hold a monthly general
meeting; sections meet weekly. All
the meetings are held in the Women's
Clubhouse except the fine arts group,
which meets in faculty members'
homes.
The group's current officers are:
Mrs. Helen Brazil, president; Mes
dames Mary Dcich, Nancy Bailey,
Regina Rohde, vice-presidents; Mrs.
Barbara Meeks, corresponding secre
tary; Mrs. Donna Knowlton, record
ing secretary; and Mrs. Jean Bishop,
treasurer.

Wives of Stanford students
:an be not only the traditional
Stanford women — but Stanford
Dames as well.
So that these wives of future
Einsteins, lawyers, doctors, and
morticians can get away from it
ill while hubby beats the books,
ihe Stanford Dames were
formed.
While hubby tramps about the
Quad, the Dames are by no means
merely busy caring for Stanford
Rough Jr. or planning meals. They
are busy thinking up activities that
can be carried out in the various sec
tions of their organization: the bridge
group, or the classes in child care
and home arts and crafts.
Of the 1,400 wives of Stanford
students, one-fourth are active Stan
ford Dames. The majority have chil
dren. Many faculty wives also be
long to the club. The organization,
founded in 1921, provides a common
meeting ground outside the wives'
usual routines.
Child Health
One of the Dames' annual practices
is to sponsor a Well-Baby Confer
ence on the first three Wednesdays
of each month. Children of Stanford
students currently enrolled who live
in San Mateo County arc given free
health checu-ups.
The fee for doctor and nurse in
charge of the physicals is donated
by San Mateo County. The Stanford
Dames assist the doctor and raise
money to buy new equipment for
their health service, which is con
ducted at Stanford Village.
Varied Lectures
On their agenda for November is
a fashion show to be sponsored in
conjunction with the Stanford Vil
lage Council.
In the home arts and crafts section,
the women hear lectures on how to
keep up their personal appearance
and lift their gardens' "faces." Lec
tures also deal with cooking and
sewing.
On the social side (when husbands
dodge midterms for party time), the
Dames hold an annual Christmas
party after caroling at the Palo Alto
Hospital. A spring dinner dance and
firesides are also on their social cal
endar.
Monthly Meetings
The Dames hold a monthly general
meeting; sections meet weekly. All
the meetings are held in the Women's
Clubhouse except the fine arts group,
which meets in faculty members'
homes.
The group's current officers are:
Mrs. Helen Brazil, president; Mes
dames Mary Dcich, Nancy Bailey,
Regina Rohde, vice-presidents; Mrs.
Barbara Meeks, corresponding secre
tary; Mrs. Donna Knowlton, record
ing secretary; and Mrs. Jean Bishop,
treasurer.
