# Delay of Professors and Students By Fog Causes Coast Guard Worries
## 
### 
Heavy fog delayed the arrival of
a boat-load of Stanford professors
and students and caused apprehen
sion on the part of Monterey Coast
Guard officials Thursday morning.
The Stanford men, two professors
and four students, sailed aboard the
40-foot fishing boat Tange Wednes
day afternoon to collect specimens
for the Hopkins Marine Station
Laboratory in Pacific' Grove.
When the Tange failed to report
back on time Thursday morning an
83 - foot patrol boat and several
smaller craft were dispatched to
search the area.
The Tange was safely docked by
6:45 p.m., however, and members of
the party disclosed that they were
not lost, but had decided to wait
until the fog lifted before heading
back to Monterey.
Because the Tange carried no ra
dio, the Coast Guard could not be
advised of fhe party's decision.

The Stanford group consisted of
,Dr. Rolf Bolin, assistant director of
the Marine Station; Donald Abbot,
his assistant; and students Thomas
Fast, Harold O'Connell, Robert
Aughtry, and Russel Eversole.
Two other members of the party
were Fast's father and Gilbert Vla
mik, a mechanic from the Monterey
Navy research department.
