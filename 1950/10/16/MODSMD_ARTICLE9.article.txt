# Indians Get Rough Battle From Scrapping Broncos
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Santa Clara exploded Jack
Kaplan, a secret v/eapon of near
atomic proportions in Stanford
Stadium Saturday afternoon,
and Stanford's outland\shly-fa
vored Indians can thank the
whims of a smiling fate for a 23
to 13 non-Conference victory
over a rejuvenated Bronco team.
Kaplan, of course, wasn't the only
Bronc surprise of the day. Much of
the credit for the unexpected upris
ing is due their hard-charging,
vicious-tackling line, which had
showed up as so much jello in Santa
Clara's previous games. And to an
alert secondary which stopped every- !
thing that came its way except Bill j
McColl.
Rut the Indians won, and this
time it's the other team that had to
he content with a moral victory.
Just three minutes and 15 seconds
into the opening frame, Dick Horn
boomed a long punt into the end
zone and the arms of Marte Formico
who reversed it to Abe Dung. Dung,
probably the most surprised person
on the field, tried valiantly to get out
of the trap; but one big arm of Bill
McColl cut him down directly in
front of the goal posts, and still in
the end zone. Stanford, 2 to 0.
So Santa Clara kicked off from
its own 20; and Stanford, still be
lieving the form charts, came
storming hack as if they meant to
blast the Broncos all the way to
San Jose. Harry Hugasian re
turned the kick 18 yards to the
Card 48, from \yhere line smashes
by Hugasian and Boh White, punc
tuated with a 15-yard Kerkorian
to McColl aerial, moved the In
dians to the Santa Clara nine.
With the scoreboard showing first
and goal to go, the Bronco line made
the first of many heroic stands.
White carried to the two in two at
tempts, but a pitchout from Ker
knrian to Boyd Benson on: thi'rd
down was smashed for a six-yard
loss, and Kerkorian's last-ditch heave
[ to Bruce Van Alstyne was batted
! down in the end zone.
Two exchanges later the elusive
Kaplan took a pitchout from Bronco
quarterback John Pasco and streaked
around the Indian left end for the
longest gainer of the day. Track
man Bill Storum finally caught up
with him on the four, but Kaplan had
j churned 71 yards.
For three plays, in which Santa
Clara netted one yard lost, it looked
| as though the Indians might dupli
j cate the Broncos' goal line stand,
i The quarter ended with fourth and
j five coming up, thereby setting the
j stage 112» r some lon 4 distance play
| calling that should claim some sort
of record.
While the teams made the long
| trek to the other end of the field,
Bronc coach Dick Gallagher utilized
the direct phone connection from his
San Jose sick bed to the Santa Clara
| bench, instructing acting-headman
Mike Scarry as to what, to do next.
It was the right thing to do—a
beautifully executed pass play in
| which Pasco fired inches above the
outstretched arms of defender Bob
! White, and about the same distance
' inside the left sideline, into the arms
of end Gern Nagler for a TD. John
Daly converted and the Indians were
behind for the first time this season,
7 to 2.
The terms fought on even terms
the remainder of the half, except for
the final half-minute.
With 30 seconds showing 011 the
Associated timepiece, Dick Horn
took over as engineer of the Red
Nf.tohine on the Card nod h>
(In time ll»e seeoiid hand had spun

20 more notches, Stanford was
ahead to stay, 9 to 7.
First Horn pitched to Benson, who
was outstanding all day, for a 12-yard
gain. He missed Bob Seott, but con
nected with Bob White for 15. That
made it a first down on the 18, where
Horn threw his fourth straight aerial,
this time to McColl.
Bill gobbled it in the end zone,
and Kerkorian made good on his
first extra point try of the day.
Midway in the third period, with
Horn again at the controls, the In
dians put together a 45-yard drive
to pay dirt. And again McColl fig
ured in the big ones, taking a pair of
Horn tosses for 14 and 10 yards.
But it was Bob Griffin who put on
the clincher with a short blast at left
guard from two yards out for 16 to 7.
Bronco right end Marv Gregory
set up the final Santa Clara tally by
blocking Dick Horn's attempted punt
in the fourth period and recovering
on the Stanford seven.
Kaplan, around left end, blazed
into the end zone standing up. That
made it 16 to 13 when Daly missed
the uprights.
The final Indian score, with seven
minutes left, was something of a
freak. The Cards moved 715 yards
from their own 27, mostly on the
ground with Benson and White
packing the mail, only to lose pos
session on the one-inch line.
Hilarity reigned on the sunny side

again, and that was the ball game.

plaudits for the Stanford win. But
j don't forget the heady generalship
and accurate tossing of Horn, Ben-

sterling defensive work of such stal

beat was a strong one, if only for this
one afternoon.
Santa Clara exploded Jack
Kaplan, a secret v/eapon of near
atomic proportions in Stanford
Stadium Saturday afternoon,
and Stanford's outland\shly-fa
vored Indians can thank the
whims of a smiling fate for a 23
to 13 non-Conference victory
over a rejuvenated Bronco team.
Kaplan, of course, wasn't the only
Bronc surprise of the day. Much of
the credit for the unexpected upris
ing is due their hard-charging,
vicious-tackling line, which had
showed up as so much jello in Santa
Clara's previous games. And to an
alert secondary which stopped every- !
thing that came its way except Bill j
McColl.
Rut the Indians won, and this
time it's the other team that had to
he content with a moral victory.
Just three minutes and 15 seconds
into the opening frame, Dick Horn
boomed a long punt into the end
zone and the arms of Marte Formico
who reversed it to Abe Dung. Dung,
probably the most surprised person
on the field, tried valiantly to get out
of the trap; but one big arm of Bill
McColl cut him down directly in
front of the goal posts, and still in
the end zone. Stanford, 2 to 0.
So Santa Clara kicked off from
its own 20; and Stanford, still be
lieving the form charts, came
storming hack as if they meant to
blast the Broncos all the way to
San Jose. Harry Hugasian re
turned the kick 18 yards to the
Card 48, from \yhere line smashes
by Hugasian and Boh White, punc
tuated with a 15-yard Kerkorian
to McColl aerial, moved the In
dians to the Santa Clara nine.
With the scoreboard showing first
and goal to go, the Bronco line made
the first of many heroic stands.
White carried to the two in two at
tempts, but a pitchout from Ker
knrian to Boyd Benson on: thi'rd
down was smashed for a six-yard
loss, and Kerkorian's last-ditch heave
[ to Bruce Van Alstyne was batted
! down in the end zone.
Two exchanges later the elusive
Kaplan took a pitchout from Bronco
quarterback John Pasco and streaked
around the Indian left end for the
longest gainer of the day. Track
man Bill Storum finally caught up
with him on the four, but Kaplan had
j churned 71 yards.
For three plays, in which Santa
Clara netted one yard lost, it looked
| as though the Indians might dupli
j cate the Broncos' goal line stand,
i The quarter ended with fourth and
j five coming up, thereby setting the
j stage 112» r some lon 4 distance play
| calling that should claim some sort
of record.
While the teams made the long
| trek to the other end of the field,
Bronc coach Dick Gallagher utilized
the direct phone connection from his
San Jose sick bed to the Santa Clara
| bench, instructing acting-headman
Mike Scarry as to what, to do next.
It was the right thing to do—a
beautifully executed pass play in
| which Pasco fired inches above the
outstretched arms of defender Bob
! White, and about the same distance
' inside the left sideline, into the arms
of end Gern Nagler for a TD. John
Daly converted and the Indians were
behind for the first time this season,
7 to 2.
The terms fought on even terms
the remainder of the half, except for
the final half-minute.
With 30 seconds showing 011 the
Associated timepiece, Dick Horn
took over as engineer of the Red
Nf.tohine on the Card nod h>
(In time ll»e seeoiid hand had spun

20 more notches, Stanford was
ahead to stay, 9 to 7.
First Horn pitched to Benson, who
was outstanding all day, for a 12-yard
gain. He missed Bob Seott, but con
nected with Bob White for 15. That
made it a first down on the 18, where
Horn threw his fourth straight aerial,
this time to McColl.
Bill gobbled it in the end zone,
and Kerkorian made good on his
first extra point try of the day.
Midway in the third period, with
Horn again at the controls, the In
dians put together a 45-yard drive
to pay dirt. And again McColl fig
ured in the big ones, taking a pair of
Horn tosses for 14 and 10 yards.
But it was Bob Griffin who put on
the clincher with a short blast at left
guard from two yards out for 16 to 7.
Bronco right end Marv Gregory
set up the final Santa Clara tally by
blocking Dick Horn's attempted punt
in the fourth period and recovering
on the Stanford seven.
Kaplan, around left end, blazed
into the end zone standing up. That
made it 16 to 13 when Daly missed
the uprights.
The final Indian score, with seven
minutes left, was something of a
freak. The Cards moved 715 yards
from their own 27, mostly on the
ground with Benson and White
packing the mail, only to lose pos
session on the one-inch line.
Hilarity reigned on the sunny side

—Stanford played a good game of
football Saturday. The team they
beat was a strong one, if only for this
one afternoon.
Santa Clara exploded Jack
Kaplan, a secret v/eapon of near
atomic proportions in Stanford
Stadium Saturday afternoon,
and Stanford's outland\shly-fa
vored Indians can thank the
whims of a smiling fate for a 23
to 13 non-Conference victory
over a rejuvenated Bronco team.
Kaplan, of course, wasn't the only
Bronc surprise of the day. Much of
the credit for the unexpected upris
ing is due their hard-charging,
vicious-tackling line, which had
showed up as so much jello in Santa
Clara's previous games. And to an
alert secondary which stopped every- !
thing that came its way except Bill j
McColl.
Rut the Indians won, and this
time it's the other team that had to
he content with a moral victory.
Just three minutes and 15 seconds
into the opening frame, Dick Horn
boomed a long punt into the end
zone and the arms of Marte Formico
who reversed it to Abe Dung. Dung,
probably the most surprised person
on the field, tried valiantly to get out
of the trap; but one big arm of Bill
McColl cut him down directly in
front of the goal posts, and still in
the end zone. Stanford, 2 to 0.
So Santa Clara kicked off from
its own 20; and Stanford, still be
lieving the form charts, came
storming hack as if they meant to
blast the Broncos all the way to
San Jose. Harry Hugasian re
turned the kick 18 yards to the
Card 48, from \yhere line smashes
by Hugasian and Boh White, punc
tuated with a 15-yard Kerkorian
to McColl aerial, moved the In
dians to the Santa Clara nine.
With the scoreboard showing first
and goal to go, the Bronco line made
the first of many heroic stands.
White carried to the two in two at
tempts, but a pitchout from Ker
knrian to Boyd Benson on: thi'rd
down was smashed for a six-yard
loss, and Kerkorian's last-ditch heave
[ to Bruce Van Alstyne was batted
! down in the end zone.
Two exchanges later the elusive
Kaplan took a pitchout from Bronco
quarterback John Pasco and streaked
around the Indian left end for the
longest gainer of the day. Track
man Bill Storum finally caught up
with him on the four, but Kaplan had
j churned 71 yards.
For three plays, in which Santa
Clara netted one yard lost, it looked
| as though the Indians might dupli
j cate the Broncos' goal line stand,
i The quarter ended with fourth and
j five coming up, thereby setting the
j stage 112» r some lon 4 distance play
| calling that should claim some sort
of record.
While the teams made the long
| trek to the other end of the field,
Bronc coach Dick Gallagher utilized
the direct phone connection from his
San Jose sick bed to the Santa Clara
| bench, instructing acting-headman
Mike Scarry as to what, to do next.
It was the right thing to do—a
beautifully executed pass play in
| which Pasco fired inches above the
outstretched arms of defender Bob
! White, and about the same distance
' inside the left sideline, into the arms
of end Gern Nagler for a TD. John
Daly converted and the Indians were
behind for the first time this season,
7 to 2.
The terms fought on even terms
the remainder of the half, except for
the final half-minute.
With 30 seconds showing 011 the
Associated timepiece, Dick Horn
took over as engineer of the Red
Nf.tohine on the Card nod h>
(In time ll»e seeoiid hand had spun

20 more notches, Stanford was
ahead to stay, 9 to 7.
First Horn pitched to Benson, who
was outstanding all day, for a 12-yard
gain. He missed Bob Seott, but con
nected with Bob White for 15. That
made it a first down on the 18, where
Horn threw his fourth straight aerial,
this time to McColl.
Bill gobbled it in the end zone,
and Kerkorian made good on his
first extra point try of the day.
Midway in the third period, with
Horn again at the controls, the In
dians put together a 45-yard drive
to pay dirt. And again McColl fig
ured in the big ones, taking a pair of
Horn tosses for 14 and 10 yards.
But it was Bob Griffin who put on
the clincher with a short blast at left
guard from two yards out for 16 to 7.
Bronco right end Marv Gregory
set up the final Santa Clara tally by
blocking Dick Horn's attempted punt
in the fourth period and recovering
on the Stanford seven.
Kaplan, around left end, blazed
into the end zone standing up. That
made it 16 to 13 when Daly missed
the uprights.
The final Indian score, with seven
minutes left, was something of a
freak. The Cards moved 715 yards
from their own 27, mostly on the
ground with Benson and White
packing the mail, only to lose pos
session on the one-inch line.
Hilarity reigned on the sunny side
