WHAT'S
YOUR
GUESS?
As a topnotch expert in the
field of "Pigskinology" we're
asking your advice. Who is
going to do it to who this
Saturday and by how much?
Guess Right
Get Gas Free
If your prediction is correct
—100 gallons of free gaso
line is yours: That is IF you
drive into the Dividend Self
Serve Station at Forest and
Ernerso.i Sts., Palo Alto, be
fore the deadline Saturday
noon, October the 21st and
fill out an "Official Dividend
Scorecard."
One winner gets the entire
100 gallons. Two winners
gc-t 50 gallons each, & etc.;
but EVERY WINNER gets at
least 10 gallons each, even if
the whole campus guesses
right—so drive in now and
fill out a card—you do not
have to buy a thing.
