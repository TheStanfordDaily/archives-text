# Asked About Name, Li'l Injun Says 'Ugh!'
## 
### 
"By the shores of Lagunita; by
•the waving, swaying palm trees . . ."
dwells a dissatisfied Injun — Li'l
Ugh. Not that he isn't proud and
honored about being chosen from
all the rest of his tribe to be the
chcrished mascot for the Stanford
braves; it's just that he doesn't like
his name.
He's so unhappy about it, in
fact, that life has bccome almost
unbearable for him, and ever
since the official christening last
Friday the scrappy little charac
ter has lain on his deer skins,
weak from hunger and sick at
heart.
Maybe to some people this dis
like of a name might seem like a
trivial reason for becoming disillu
sioned with the world, but they are
probably satisfied with their Chris
tian names or, if not, have a distinc
tive nickname. "But," to quote the
Li'l Injun, "what kind of a nick
name could you make out of Li'l
Ugh?
Yell leader Red Dog Henderson,
hearing of the Injun's plight and
touched by the heart-rending story,
made a trip down to the secluded
reservation of the mascot (a place
kept secret from roving Bears) to
see the tribe witch doctor.
The word was that Li'l Indian
won't make the trip to Los An
geles for the UCLA tilt unless "he
gets heap better," said the local
medic, Dr. Bear Axe.
Going into the little fellow's te
pee, Red Dog said Li'l Injun raised
his head weakly and begged Red
Dog to find him a new name. Hen
derson promised the Injun that he
would find him another name and
the Li'l Injun, upon hearing this,
seemed to brighten immediately in
spirit and said he would try and
gather strength for his tangle with
the Bruin this coming Saturday.
Not only did the little Injun him
self request a change in his name,
but student sentiment at the prc
game rally last Friday night and
at the game Saturday made it c'rar
that they agreed with him in want
ing another name. A new title will
be found for the Li'l Injun by Sat
urday's game.


LI'L NAMELESS
