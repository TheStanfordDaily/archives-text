# Men to Try For Rhodes Scholarship
## 
### 
Men students interested in compet
ing for Rhodes Scholarships should
meet tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 p.m.
in the West Memorial Library in the
Political Science Department, ac
cording to Prof. Philip Buck, chair
man of the Stanford choosing com
mittee.
Students eligible to compete for
the scholarship must be in their
sophomore year. The applicants must
be 10 years old by October, 11)51, and
they must not have passed the age
of 25.
Each year 32 United States stu
dents under the Rhodes Scholarship
are given the opportunity to study
at Oxford University, England. The
two- oi three-year scholarship give.
500 pounds a year, which covers liv
ing expenses and travel on the Con
tinent.
Competition Selective
Rhodes Scholars arc chosen on the
basis of scholarship, personal quali
ties, physical fitness, and willingness
to engage in sports.
The system for choosing candidates
for the scholarship is complex. First,
the Stanford committee proposes
candidates to cither the student's
home state or to the committee of
the state in which he is attending
school. Six states compose a ragion
and to each region arc sent the names
of 12 candidates, two from each state.
Four out of the 12 candidates arc
selected from each of the eight re
gions in the United States, thus mak
ing a total of 32 candidates for the
entire nation.
Since each state has the same quota
for candidates, the competition is
much greater in California than in
Oregon, Nevada, or New Mexico,
where there are fewer universities.
For this reason, the Stanford com
mittee can, and is very willing to
nominate students to their home
states, says Professor Buck.
Stanford Represented
Stanford has had at least one
Rhodes Scholar each year during the
last 10 years. In 1950, Joseph An
thony, an English major, was nomi
nated by his home state, Montana,
and was selected.
Students unable to attend the
Wednesday meeting should contact
Buck by Friday noon.
The Rhodes Scholarships were es
tablished by Cecil Rhodes in 1904 and
are given to students in the United
States, British Dominions, and Ger
many.
