# Met Soprano Wins Praise

### ROY HEMMING 
Nadine Conner got the 1950-51
Concert Scries of the Associated
Students of Stanford University off
to a fine start last evening in Me
morial Hall. The Metropolitan Op
era soprano gave ample evidence
that she is not only one of the most
eye-filling of grand opera's stars,
but also the possessor of one of its
most pleasant lyric voices.
Miss Conner's singing was distin
guished by the effortless manner in
which she presented each work. Her
tones were clear and unforced, and
she showed an excellent command
of tonal nuance throughout. There
was, however, a noticeable lack of
real warmth in her voice in all but
the last group of songs ("Cockles
and Mussels," "Wee Hughie," "Corn
in' Through the Rye," and "I'll See
You Again"). For the greater part
of the program she stood fairly
stiffly next to the piano, and many
of her interpretations seemed al
most as stiff as her posture.
That is not to say that such a
manner did not fit a good portion
of her program. Miss Conner was
at her best — which means very
good indeed—in the impressionistic
"Clair de Lune" by Szule, and in
Dvorak's "Song to the Moon" and
Strauss's "Heimkohr." These were
works to which her tranquil lyri
cism was perfectly suited, and
therefore perfectly projected. It
seemed surprising that she did not
include songs by Ravel or Debussy
for which this quality of her voice
is admirably suited.
Galen Lurwick contributed com
mendable piano accompaniment to
help make Miss Conner's concert a
praiseworthy start of the new con
cert season.
