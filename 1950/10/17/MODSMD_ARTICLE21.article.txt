dramatic meeting with the Allied
Korean commander in a radio spee( h
over the four major networks at 8:30
p.m., PST. tonight from the stage of
the San Francisco War Memorial
j Opera House.
White House sources said the
president probably will not proclaim
any new U.S. policy toward Asia. It,
is more likely, they said, that he will
merely restate the existing U.S. at
titude toward the Communist men
ace in the Far East.
It is possible that the Mac Arthur
meeting may be mentioned only
briefly in ( the President's foreign
policy statements, these sources said.
