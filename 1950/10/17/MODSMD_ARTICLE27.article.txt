The success of any student leader or organ
ization is judged not only by outward showings
but also by less noticeable organizational abil
ity.
Rally Corn is one of those groups which has
fallen short on the latter score at different times.
Their most recent faux pas was their failure to
coordinate a simple yell with the band stunts
at the football game Saturday.
The yell leaders had been told to stop the
card stunts for about half a minute and lead a
yell which would fit into the band formations
on the field. However, after a wait of several
minutes, the band went on without the yell,
much to the embarrassment of all concerned.
The band on several occasions has made
extra efforts to contribute to the success of ral
lies put on by the yell leaders. A little more
planning and cooperation between student or
ganizations will go a long way.
Li'l Ugh was one of those names that just
didn't click. Out of 7,500 Stanford students,
there must be some middle name that would
fit the little Indian.
* * *
Several people walked out of the Sunday
Evening Movies in disgust this week as the cat
calls continued into "Intermezzo," one of the
better movies put on by the weekly series.
Faculty and outsiders have often said that
the Stanford students' worst fault lies in their
sense of humor.
When the movie manager offers two serial
chapters plus a comedy it might seem that the
audience would have gotten the kicks out of

their systems and been able to settle down to
a high class film.

Accidents like the one which seriously in
jured two students on the curvy roads toward
Rossotti's make us think twice when we see
the speedometer turning red.

When you can't find parking space north of
the Union you have to continue on the one-way
street way around the Corporation Yard and the
Post Office.
If parking were prohibited in a few narrow
spots on Panama Street, two-way traffic could
travel along this street. The whole problem was
created when the Corporation Yard closed off
the street east of the yard.
That ever-recurring problem of whether or
not Hoover Tower should be open to visitors
was brought up again last weekend, as over 100
friends of Stanford visited the Farm especially
to tour the famous tower.
A small staff of guides could handle the
crowd easily—at least during the afternoon. If
there is no room in the budget for these extra
salaries, a small charge, similar to the one made
at Cal's Campanile, would be a good solution.
Stanford's public relations will improve im
mensely if the Library staff shows "active" in
terest in opening the Tower.

better movies put on by the weekly series.
Faculty and outsiders have often said that
the Stanford students' worst fault lies in their
sense of humor.
When the movie manager offers two serial
chapters plus a comedy it might seem that the
audience would have gotten the kicks out of

their systems and been able to settle down to
a high class film.

Accidents like the one which seriously in
jured two students on the curvy roads toward
Rossotti's make us think twice when we see
the speedometer turning red.

When you can't find parking space north of
the Union you have to continue on the one-way
street way around the Corporation Yard and the
Post Office.
If parking were prohibited in a few narrow
spots on Panama Street, two-way traffic could
travel along this street. The whole problem was
created when the Corporation Yard closed off
the street east of the yard.
That ever-recurring problem of whether or
not Hoover Tower should be open to visitors
was brought up again last weekend, as over 100
friends of Stanford visited the Farm especially
to tour the famous tower.
A small staff of guides could handle the
crowd easily—at least during the afternoon. If
there is no room in the budget for these extra
salaries, a small charge, similar to the one made
at Cal's Campanile, would be a good solution.
Stanford's public relations will improve im
mensely if the Library staff shows "active" in
terest in opening the Tower.

The success of any student leader or organ
ization is judged not only by outward showings
but also by less noticeable organizational abil
ity.
Rally Corn is one of those groups which has
fallen short on the latter score at different times.
Their most recent faux pas was their failure to
coordinate a simple yell with the band stunts
at the football game Saturday.
The yell leaders had been told to stop the
card stunts for about half a minute and lead a
yell which would fit into the band formations
on the field. However, after a wait of several
minutes, the band went on without the yell,
much to the embarrassment of all concerned.
The band on several occasions has made
extra efforts to contribute to the success of ral
lies put on by the yell leaders. A little more
planning and cooperation between student or
ganizations will go a long way.
Li'l Ugh was one of those names that just
didn't click. Out of 7,500 Stanford students,
there must be some middle name that would
fit the little Indian.
