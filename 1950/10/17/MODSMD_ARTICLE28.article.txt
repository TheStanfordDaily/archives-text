# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL KERRY 
I have been to the Stanford Health Service.
It wasn't nearly so bad as sitting in the Cal rooting
section, but it took longer. That is the reason, dear
avid reader (don't worry, mom, I'm OK now), my

spicy pieces of neo-wit have not '
appeared the last few days. Pal- â€¢
mieri ran through his last type- '
writer ribbon and his last Big j
Came date prospect yesterday, so \
1 got out in the nick of time.
Admittedly, five days is a very j
long time, even by our Health
Si rvice standards, to wait to see .
a doctor, but by the time you do |

get in you are either sick enough to really need one,
lully recovered, or ready for the undertaker who
works in close conjunction with the organization.
I don't want to complain, but I was in that waiting
room so long that the bros. had to have my mail trans
ferred over. Got two copies of Time magazine while
1 was theie. Contrary to the mags over there, Dewey
did not win the election.
By the way, Mr. Vucinich, that's why I've kindu
ihj( been at your 10 o'clock the last few weeks.
No nted for me to go to classes now, I was over
behind the Women's Gym for so long that I m gradu
ating in December as a pre-med student.
Along about Monday, after shaving with an old scal
pel, I asked the pretty yirl at the desk how much
longer 1 would have to wait. "I can't give you any

information," she said, "you'll have to ask the doctor."
1 coughed in her face, just lor spite.
I'm probably the only guy on record to get bed
sores from a waiting room chair. If I owned a fast
bicycle, I could have seen a friend of mine who is a
butcher in Kansas City sooner than I saw that doctor.
Oh yes, I did get to see the Doc at long last. A very
nice, efficient man, almost worth the wait. The only
bind was that by the time I saw him I had forgotten
what was the matter with me.
"You need penicillin," he said sagely.
Oh, brother, the places they put penicillin these
days! The nurse, likewise, was very kind, and I de
cided that the next time I had a month off, I would
drop over to the Health Service again. Then she
slipped me the needle.
This is the first time I have ever worn a hand-aid
on the place where I am now wearing a band-aid.
It doesn't show, except when I pull out my wallet.
I don't want to give the impression that everyone has
to wail as long as I did. One gurl, who came in 20
minutes after I did, saw a doctor in exactly nine
minutes. One chap, who was obviously lonesome,
waited for fifteen. I began to feel like a Philadelphia
shortstop, or Jeff Cravath at an alumni luncheon. Un
loved.
I've got to go back and get another shot tomorrow,
but this time I'm taking a box-lunch and a complete
works of Shakespeare. I think I'll go over there after
my 10 o'clock, however. I'd like to see if Mr. Vucinich
has changed much since the last time I saw him.
