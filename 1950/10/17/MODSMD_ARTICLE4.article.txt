# Tidelands Decision
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme
Court today upheld the federal
government's claim to submerged
lands off the coasts of Texas and
Louisiana which are estimated to
contain 5.000.000.000 to 10,000,000,-
000 barrels of oil.
II finally settled the 18-month-old
tidelands dispute by refusing to
reconsider the decision it handed
down last June. The tribunal ruled
then that the government, not the
states, has "paramount rights" to
the Gulf of Mexico lands.
