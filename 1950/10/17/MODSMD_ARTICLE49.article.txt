### 
The alien exclusion measures an
nounced last Friday seriously en
danger the whole student exchange
program with Europe, Werner
Kubsch told an opening panel of
(he WSSF conference here- Satur
day.
Kubsch, who arrived in this
country two weeks ago from the
University of Munich, called for a
petition to revoke the law affecting
German and Italian students who
were given no choice but to join
the totalitarian youth parties dur
ing the last war.
No Politics
Speaking for the students of West
Germany, he said, "We don't want
any political movements in our
universities. We want to be free."
The migration of many students
like himself from Eastern Germany
to find freedom created an immense
need for employment, housing, and
other material. The enrollment in
the University of Munich has dou
bled since before the war, the
speaker said, in spite of the fact
that 40 per cent of the university
was destroyed during the war.

Kubsch described, in contrast, the
Eastern zone where, since all uni
versities are political, students en
joy government subsidy. He said
conditions are such that West Ger
man students can be invited into
the Russian zone to study without
expenses.
George Cvikevic, a Russian po
litical refugee, spoke of the 15,000
or 20,000 DP students who over
flowed into Germany, Austria, and
Italy from the East. They were not
always warmly welcomed by their
former enemies, he said, and there
remain 4,000 DP's waiting to get out
of Germany to study.
