# INTRAMURAL FOOTBALL
## Firehouse Boys Shut Out Phi Delta Phi 20 to 0 
### BOB SPIELMANN 
In a game that ended in almost
total darkness, nearly machine
perfect Firehou.se team cooled off
Phi Delta Phi. 20 to 0, yesterday
afternoon. The Firehouse hoys led,
7 to 0, iit the half.
Controlling the ball for almost the
entire game the boys from the Fire
house ran through and passed over
the Phi Delt's, who were never once
able to work the ball over the mid
field stripe.
Alter the opening kickoff both

teams stalled and exchanged punts.
Phi Delta Phi then obtained posses
sion of the ball and started moving as
Bob Jansen's passes clicked, but an
interception by Monte Pfyl put out
the fire and the fraternity boys were
never in contention after that.
First Score
On a beautiful fake play Pfyl raced
for 30 yards and a first down on the
Phi Delta Phi 35-yard line. A pass
from Pfyl to Jones was nullified be
cause of a clipping penalty. On the
next play Dude Anguis took another
Pfyl pass and rambled all the way
for a TD. Pfyl passed to Bob Zeike
for the extra point.
After receiving the kickoff, the
Phi Delt's went nowhere. The Fire
house took over and had moved the
ball to the Phi Delt 9-yard line as the
half ended.
Firehouse Rolls
The Firehouse received the kickoff
in the second half and started moving
the ball with monotonous regularity,
Monte Pfyl passing to Jones and
Frank Pfyl. The drive stalled on the
9-yard line, however, with Shemway
making a great save for Phi Delt's by
knocking down a pass in the end
zone.
Four plays later Anguis intercepted
a pass and returned it to the Phi Delt
12-yard line. Monte Pfyl then passed
to Zeike for the TD.
With time running out Monte Pfyl
intercepted a desperation pass on his
own 30 and returned it 60 yards to
the Phi Delta Phi 10-yard line. The
Firehouse boys then presented a
brother act as Monte Pfyl passed to
Frank for the TD and then lor the
extra point.
At this point the game ended with
no one being able to see the ball any
more, anyway.
Dud Wright was outstanding for
Phi Delta on defense, while for the
Firehouse Monte Pfyl did everything
with the ball except swallow it. Bob
Morris did a fine job of quarterback
ing also.

urday's 23 to 13 victory. For the afternoon's work McColl caught
seven passes, one of which netted a touchdown.
In a game that ended in almost
total darkness, nearly machine
perfect Firehou.se team cooled off
Phi Delta Phi. 20 to 0, yesterday
afternoon. The Firehouse hoys led,
7 to 0, iit the half.
Controlling the ball for almost the
entire game the boys from the Fire
house ran through and passed over
the Phi Delt's, who were never once
able to work the ball over the mid
field stripe.
Alter the opening kickoff both

teams stalled and exchanged punts.
Phi Delta Phi then obtained posses
sion of the ball and started moving as
Bob Jansen's passes clicked, but an
interception by Monte Pfyl put out
the fire and the fraternity boys were
never in contention after that.
First Score
On a beautiful fake play Pfyl raced
for 30 yards and a first down on the
Phi Delta Phi 35-yard line. A pass
from Pfyl to Jones was nullified be
cause of a clipping penalty. On the
next play Dude Anguis took another
Pfyl pass and rambled all the way
for a TD. Pfyl passed to Bob Zeike
for the extra point.
After receiving the kickoff, the
Phi Delt's went nowhere. The Fire
house took over and had moved the
ball to the Phi Delt 9-yard line as the
half ended.
Firehouse Rolls
The Firehouse received the kickoff
in the second half and started moving
the ball with monotonous regularity,
Monte Pfyl passing to Jones and
Frank Pfyl. The drive stalled on the
9-yard line, however, with Shemway
making a great save for Phi Delt's by
knocking down a pass in the end
zone.
Four plays later Anguis intercepted
a pass and returned it to the Phi Delt
12-yard line. Monte Pfyl then passed
to Zeike for the TD.
With time running out Monte Pfyl
intercepted a desperation pass on his
own 30 and returned it 60 yards to
the Phi Delta Phi 10-yard line. The
Firehouse boys then presented a
brother act as Monte Pfyl passed to
Frank for the TD and then lor the
extra point.
At this point the game ended with
no one being able to see the ball any
more, anyway.
Dud Wright was outstanding for
Phi Delta on defense, while for the
Firehouse Monte Pfyl did everything
with the ball except swallow it. Bob
Morris did a fine job of quarterback
ing also.
