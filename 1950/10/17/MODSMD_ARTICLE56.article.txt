# Rolling Red Meets Bruin; Past Habit Faces Ruin
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's Indians, known to play
inspired football in the Coliseum,
invade Smogland this week to meet
UCLA, past disbelievex-s of Card
rave notices. This will mark the
twenty-first game between the ri
vals. %
The powder blue boys from
Westwood have had a bad habit of
upsetting Stanford Rose Bowl hopes
in two of the last four meetings.
The Indians are out to break the
bad habit and to win their second
conference start.
It was only last year that, after
sustaining a defeat at the hands of
powerful Michigan, Stanford met
the Bruins in Stanford' Stadium.
Cards Pushed Bruins
Favorites, the Indians pushed the
gaudy-clad Uclans all over the Sta
dium's green floor, only to end up
on the short end of a 14 to 7 count.
Johnson's number 17 jersey was
all over the field as he ran, passed,
and literally shoved Stanford's
Bowl hopes down the rooters'
throats in the opening conference
game.
Spoiler Role
In 1946 the Bruins were once
again spoilers. Meeting the West
wooders in the massive LA. Bowl
before 90,000, the Indians returning
to the gridiron wars after a war
lay-off, were even money to cap
ture their second conference game.
The Bruins paid little attention to
Merriman & Co. and their clippings,
but proceeded to overwhelm the
Cards 2H to 6. The Uclans replaced
the Injuns in the Rose Bow!—mer
ciful football gods!—and got turned
on the backs of their laps by Illi
nois 45 tq 14.
The Wcstwooders trampled Stan
ford 39 to 6 in that winless 1947.
Stanford started its excellent
football campaign in the Coliseum in

1948 when, led by Bobby White, the
Indians chalked up their first con
ference win since 1946 by upsetting
a good Bruin eleven 34 to 13.
Pre-War Upsets
Going back to pre-war days, the
Uclans have come up with their
share of victories, but most of them
have been by the way of upset. The
most notable Was in 1935, when an
upstart Bruin team came to town.
Meeting the Vow Boys, then annual
choice for the Pasadena affair, the
Blue and Gold upset the dope and
the Cards to take home a 7 to 6 win.
In 20 meetings Stanford has had
12 wins, UCLA seven. One ended
in a deadlock.
