# Van Alstyne Will Miss UCLA Tilt
## 
### 
Bruce Van Alstyne, Stanford's j
end injured in Saturday's Santa |
Clara contest, is definitely out of
the UCLA game. The announce
ment was made late yesterday af
ternoon by team physician Stanley
Lourdeaux and trainer Connie Jar
vis after an inspection of X-rays of
Van Alstyne's knee.
The injury to the ligament and
cartilage of Van Alstyne's knee is
probably not serious enough, how
ever, to prevent his return to ac
tion against Washington the follow
ing week.
There was some good news, too,
from the Card training camp last
evening. Norm Manoogian and
Owen Powell, the damaged guards
who have missed the last two In
dian outings, have "good possibili
ties" of playing against the Bruins,
according to Jarvis.
The same holds true for Bob
Scott, another wingman, who hurt
his ankle in the Bronco fray. Scott's
chances of appearing in the Coli
seum were described as "very
good."
Tackle Leon King, another ankle
victim, will definitely be ready by
game time Saturday.
The Stanford squad went through
only a light workout yesterday,
knocking off early for a showing of
the Santa Clara game pictures. In
addition, they listened to scouting
reports last night of the UCLA-Illi
nois game. Illinois edged the Bruins
Friday night, 14 to 7.
Meanwhile, reports drifting up
from the Southland quoted West
wood mentor Henry "Red" Sanders
as stating that this year's Stanford
team is the Cards' finest in ten
years. Sanders is basing his estima
tion on the reports of his scouts.
