# Coeds Demand Swap Stern For Branner in Fight Song
## 
### 
There's a new fight song on the I
campus, and it's not "Roll You Big
Red Machine." It's the Branner girls' |
fight gong, and the first line goes j
something likeâ€”"We want Stern, We j
want Stern. Hi-O-the-Merry-O. We
want Stern."
Origin of the song is unknown, but :
it is rapidly replacing "Goodnight,
Irene" 1 on the coed hit parade.
It,seems that the spark that lit the
flame that may put the Big Game
bonfire to shame was the Stern Open
House two weeks ago. Most Branner
girls had never been in Stern before
and took advantage of the opportun
ity to inspect the four large lounges
and the fluorescent lighting and the
modern dining rooms.
It was just about that time that j
tHe Branner girls began to feel that
it'was a shame that they had taken
Bvanne-r away from the men.
-It's really too bad," said one coed.
"After all, Branner was built to be
sdjr't of a companion hall to Toyon. \
and I'm sure the men would be more
than happy to have it back."
"I like Branner. This is my second
year here, and I think it's wonderful,"
srajys her roommate. "But I still feel
sort of creepy when I walk through
the lobby at night and look up and
see John Branner staring down at
me from over the fireplace. And I
guess it's just as silly for men to live
in Lucie Stern Hall that's named for
a woman. I guess the only thing for

us to do is to trade halls with the
men who live there."
And most of her corridor-mates
agree. There are long discussions
lasting far into the night discussing
the attack. And when 190 girls get
an idea in their heads, you'd better
watch out.
Maybe its just as well the archi
tects decided not to put a tile roof
on Stern.
It might be blown off in the coming
fight.
