## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Society
of Chemical Engineers heard a talk
concerning the function of their or
ganization by Dr. Ralph R. Paxton,
associate professor of chemistry, at
their first meeting last Thursday in
the Chemistry Building.
Dr. Paxton explained that the or
ganization's aim was to help to
build up the reputation of the de
partment and to improve the pro
fessional standing of students grad
uated from the School of Chemical
Engineering.
