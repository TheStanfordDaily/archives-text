# Prof Reports Greek Turmoil
## 
### 
All is not well in Greece, despite
surface appearances to the con
trary, is the report of Dr. Hazel D.
Hansen, classics professor, back at
Stanford after 15 months in Greece, j
There is a terrific contrast, she (
said, between Athens, where there i
is an abundance of food and other
goods, including luxuries, and the
back country. Inflated prices, lack
of transportation, and shortage of
basic food supplies and clothing
create critical problems for Greek (
peasantry in these areas.
The shadow of war still hangs I
c'osely over the country. Sporadic I
fighting is still going on in the
mountain areas, where small bands
of rebel troops hold out and raid
isolated villages, so the Greek army i
is still in the field despite the end
of large-scalc hostilities.
From the scholarly viewpoint,
Dr. Hansen's chief accomplishment
was the work she did on the con
tents of five graves of wealthy citi
zens who lived on the island of
Skyros in the Iron Age, roughly
1000 years B.C.
