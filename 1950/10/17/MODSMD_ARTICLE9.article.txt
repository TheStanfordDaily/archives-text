### 
Among his former employers
George Kerr, an authority on Far
Eastern affairs who will address
the public tonight at 7:30 in Me
morial Auditorium, can name
the Empire of Japan.
For five years before World War II
| Professor Kerr taught and studied in \
| government schools in Japan and
I Formosa, then a Japanese colony, i
I 'Even in acadcmic occupations we
felt the increasing restrictions Japan j
; was imposing on foreigners after the
so-called 'Chinese incident' in 193 V' |
' he recalled.
"I went to Formosa, alter two years j
| in Japan, to finish a paper I was writ
j ing, originally planning to stay six
months. I stayed to teach and work
there for three years," he said.
During this time he had the oppor
tunity to travel widely on the stra
! tcgic island and less intensively
throughout the rest of the Far East,
including Korea.

President Ilarry S. Truman's San
Francisco specch will be broadcast
over the loudspeaker in Memorial
Auditorium following the Tuesday
Evening talk, the Committee on
Public Exercises announced yes
terday.

Professor Kerr was general direc
tor of a research project concerning
Formosa for part of the war. "For a
lime it was thought that the invasion
of Japan would begin by taking For
mosa. Consequently about 2,000 men
were trained for an occupation that
never materialized."
Kerr supervised at that time the
preparation of 12 books for Gl's cov
ering different aspects of Formosan
culture and life. Last summer he
lectured at the University of Cali
fornia and now is conducting a semi
nar at Stanford on current problems

in Formosa and doing additional re- i
search work besides.
"The Hoover Library hero has one J
of the few outstanding collections of I
information on Formosa in the |
United States," Professor Kerr re- j
marked. "An interest in China,
Japan, and the Orient generally j
seems to characterize the West
Coast. It is entirely natural that this I
should be, since Far Eastern prob- I
lems have always had a good deal of {
immediacy in this region."
In his talk tonight, Professor Kerr !
will trace the attempts of the For- j
mosan people to achieve self-gov- j
ernment witfhin the regime, without I
Hie support of Chiang or of the Com
munists.

search work besides.
"The Hoover Library hero has one J
of the few outstanding collections of I
information on Formosa in the |
United States," Professor Kerr re- j
marked. "An interest in China,
Japan, and the Orient generally j
seems to characterize the West
Coast. It is entirely natural that this I
should be, since Far Eastern prob- I
lems have always had a good deal of {
immediacy in this region."
In his talk tonight, Professor Kerr !

Among his former employers
George Kerr, an authority on Far
Eastern affairs who will address
the public tonight at 7:30 in Me
morial Auditorium, can name
the Empire of Japan.
For five years before World War II
| Professor Kerr taught and studied in \
| government schools in Japan and
I Formosa, then a Japanese colony, i
I 'Even in acadcmic occupations we
felt the increasing restrictions Japan j
; was imposing on foreigners after the
so-called 'Chinese incident' in 193 V' |
' he recalled.
"I went to Formosa, alter two years j
| in Japan, to finish a paper I was writ
j ing, originally planning to stay six
months. I stayed to teach and work
there for three years," he said.
During this time he had the oppor
tunity to travel widely on the stra
! tcgic island and less intensively
throughout the rest of the Far East,
including Korea.

President Ilarry S. Truman's San
Francisco specch will be broadcast
over the loudspeaker in Memorial
Auditorium following the Tuesday
Evening talk, the Committee on
Public Exercises announced yes
terday.

Professor Kerr was general direc
tor of a research project concerning
Formosa for part of the war. "For a
lime it was thought that the invasion
of Japan would begin by taking For
mosa. Consequently about 2,000 men
were trained for an occupation that
never materialized."
Kerr supervised at that time the
preparation of 12 books for Gl's cov
ering different aspects of Formosan
culture and life. Last summer he
lectured at the University of Cali
fornia and now is conducting a semi
nar at Stanford on current problems

in Formosa and doing additional re- i
search work besides.
