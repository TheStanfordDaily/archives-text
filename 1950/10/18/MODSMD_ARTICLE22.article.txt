### AL McCOMBS Managing Editor, The Daily 
SAN FRANCISCO WAR MEMORIAL OPERA HOUSE, Oct. 17—
President Harry S. Truman tonight offered the people of Ar.ia a
"partnership of peace," and told the United States that recent suc
cesses in Korea would bring no letup in defense preparations.
The President had nothing startlingly new to offer his listeners,

but he did stand firm in the con
viction that the tactics of the So
viet Union were directed against
world pcace, and that the United
States, in defense of its ideals of
freedom and independence, must be
strong enough to meet the Commu
nist aggression.
He put the entire blame for the
disrupted peace on Russia, and said,
"The Soviet Union and its colonial
satellites are maintaining armed
forces of great size and strength. In
both Europe and Asia, their vast
armies pose a constant threat to
world peace.
"So long as they persist in main
taining these forces and in using
them to intimidate other countries,
the free men of the world have but
one choice if they are to remain
free. They must oppose strength
with strength."
"The only victory we seek is the
victory of peace," Mr. Truman said.
Ho emphasized that the Unite#
States seeks "no territory or spe
cial privilege in Korea or any
where."
He said the United States is ready
to help the nations of Asia, but
only if they want it.
"What we want," he said, "is a
partnership with all the world,"
and emphasiz' I that by its defense
against Communist aggression, the
United States would help to expand
the work of aiding human progress,
in co-operation with the United
Nations.
Mr. Truman declared that the
United Nations, as a result of the
Korean struggle, "is stronger than
it ever has been,"and 'ie reiterated
j his faith in the international body
| as the authority to maintain world
j peace.
"The international Communist
movement, far from being revolu
tionary, is the most reactionary
[ movement in the world today," 'Mr.
| Truman declared.
He said that if Russia really
1 wanted pcace it would prove it (1)
by living up to the principles of
i the United Nations charter, (2) by
| joining the rest of the United Na
tions in calling upon the North Ko
! rcans to lay down their arms, (.>)
by lifting the iron curtain to per
mit the free exchange of informa
tion and ideas, and (1) by joining
the United Nations in working ou 4
a system of collective security, on?
which will permit the elimination
of the atom bomb and drastic re
duction and regulation of arms.
The President, dressed in a coti
' servative blue suit, told the packed

Korea had already begun. He paid
tribute to General Mac Arthur and
informed his listening public that
at Wake Island the general had as

SAN FRANCISCO WAR MEMORIAL OPERA HOUSE, Oct. 17—
President Harry S. Truman tonight offered the people of Ar.ia a
"partnership of peace," and told the United States that recent suc
cesses in Korea would bring no letup in defense preparations.
The President had nothing startlingly new to offer his listeners,

but he did stand firm in the con
viction that the tactics of the So
viet Union were directed against
world pcace, and that the United
States, in defense of its ideals of
freedom and independence, must be
strong enough to meet the Commu
nist aggression.
He put the entire blame for the
disrupted peace on Russia, and said,
"The Soviet Union and its colonial
satellites are maintaining armed
forces of great size and strength. In
both Europe and Asia, their vast
armies pose a constant threat to
world peace.
"So long as they persist in main
taining these forces and in using
them to intimidate other countries,
the free men of the world have but
one choice if they are to remain
free. They must oppose strength
with strength."
