# Amplification of Rushing Rules
## 
### 
fraternity rushing rules fit into the category
of regulations which must be rigid so that no
loopholes exist. However, there is one point
which it is only fair to clarify or at least amplify
for freshman men, who are directly affected.
The general rule as set up by Interfraternity
Council states that there must be "no social con
tact" between fraternity men and first - year
men.
This is one rule that has many overtones
which must be sounded out according to the
individual case. This is one rule for which
strict rushing rules do not and cannot control.
Numerous cases can be cited in which frater
nity men mingle among freshmen just as cer
tainly as they do at a scheduled rushing func
tion.
What is to prevent the men from happening
to sit next to each other at the game, or attend
ing a Lagunita open house at the same time, or
even getting into a game of football at the
beach?
These are normal social functions at which
Row or Encinamen are identified not according
to their affiliations, but rather just as "guys who
happen to be around."
By the same token, why should a freshman
man be kept away from an all-campus dance—
such as the ATO Hog Wallow—which is spon
sored by one of the Greek-letter groups. It is
easy to see that rushing rules must definitely
turn thumbs down on freshmen's participation

in all - campus functions held at a fraternity
house.
For here the location itself presents the prob
lem of social contact. The hosts are identified
as fraternity men, and the freshmen form defi
nite opinions about the house.
However, because of the ruling, which IFC
President Dave Larimer has interpreted as
merely discouraging freshman men from at
tending any fraternity-sponsored function dur
ing fall quarter, freshmen are put at a disadvan
tage when it comes to planning dates.
Row houses, believing that the letter of the
law has been set down, save their parties for the
latter part of the year, and the fall social calen
dar is left comparatively empty of all-campus
parties —either on or off-campus.
The situation would take care of itself if the
Women's How houses accepted their responsi
bility of putting on one large scale all-campus
party a year.
However, during the past several years the
burden has fallen on the fraternities and the
men's and women's dormitories.
The rushing rules must be interpreted, we be
lieve, so freshman men can feel welcome at all
campus functions, other than those in fraternity
houses, during fall quarter.
If such an amplification of the rules were in
stituted, the responsibility would lie with the
fraternities in keeping the off - campus parties
identified as "all-campus" and not pushing their
privilege to the point where there is real "social
contact.''

Women's How houses accepted their responsi
bility of putting on one large scale all-campus
party a year.
However, during the past several years the
burden has fallen on the fraternities and the
men's and women's dormitories.
The rushing rules must be interpreted, we be
lieve, so freshman men can feel welcome at all
campus functions, other than those in fraternity
houses, during fall quarter.
If such an amplification of the rules were in
stituted, the responsibility would lie with the
fraternities in keeping the off - campus parties
identified as "all-campus" and not pushing their
privilege to the point where there is real "social
contact.''
fraternity rushing rules fit into the category
of regulations which must be rigid so that no
loopholes exist. However, there is one point
which it is only fair to clarify or at least amplify
for freshman men, who are directly affected.
The general rule as set up by Interfraternity
Council states that there must be "no social con
tact" between fraternity men and first - year
men.
This is one rule that has many overtones
which must be sounded out according to the
individual case. This is one rule for which
strict rushing rules do not and cannot control.
Numerous cases can be cited in which frater
nity men mingle among freshmen just as cer
tainly as they do at a scheduled rushing func
tion.
What is to prevent the men from happening
to sit next to each other at the game, or attend
ing a Lagunita open house at the same time, or
even getting into a game of football at the
beach?
These are normal social functions at which
Row or Encinamen are identified not according
to their affiliations, but rather just as "guys who
happen to be around."
By the same token, why should a freshman
man be kept away from an all-campus dance—
such as the ATO Hog Wallow—which is spon
sored by one of the Greek-letter groups. It is
easy to see that rushing rules must definitely
turn thumbs down on freshmen's participation

in all - campus functions held at a fraternity
house.
For here the location itself presents the prob
lem of social contact. The hosts are identified
as fraternity men, and the freshmen form defi
nite opinions about the house.
However, because of the ruling, which IFC
President Dave Larimer has interpreted as
merely discouraging freshman men from at
tending any fraternity-sponsored function dur
ing fall quarter, freshmen are put at a disadvan
tage when it comes to planning dates.
Row houses, believing that the letter of the
law has been set down, save their parties for the
latter part of the year, and the fall social calen
dar is left comparatively empty of all-campus
parties —either on or off-campus.
The situation would take care of itself if the
