WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 —Presi-
dent Truman has been asked to
clear the way for drafting a broad
new universal service program
under which all youths would be
trained to meet the twin threats of
war and atomic attack.
The plan, which would include
even the physically unfit, goes
much farther than administration
proposals for compulsory military
training. In addition to providing
soldiers, it would guarantee a re
serve of defense employees and
civil defense workers.
