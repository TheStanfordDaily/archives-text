# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
From what I hear, the road to Westwood this week
end will witness the greatest mass movement since
Mohammed went to Mecca in 1932 (if it hadn't been for
the depression, he'd still be with us). So far I know

of exactly three people around
here who aren't making the trip—
me and the two brothers who run
Kossott's.
1 asked them why they weren't
going and they told me they
couldn't afford it . .. seems they've
already spent my next month's
allowance. But we figure if we
start in on that keg early enough

Saturday morning, by gametime we'll float into the
Coliseum (yeah, the gag sunk, I know).
Anyway, for the benefit of those poor Drofnats who
hail lrom the dreary wastes and icy blasts of the
Northwest, and who have yet to taste the enchant
ment of a weekend in the land of milk and honey, here
are a few tips from an old commuter.
The first nine holes of the course stretch from
campus through Gilroy and Salinas to Paso Robles
. . . par, about three hours and 15 minutes. Now that
Bayshore bypasses San Jose this part is a breeze, but I
remember when San Jose cops had it in for journeying
Stanford students to the point where you held out
youi driver's license the moment you crossed the city
limits and they handed you a little pink carbon good
for at least ten bucks or ten days.
They were so dependable I think their mothers
were scared by the toll gates on the Bay Bridge.
Outside San Jose fairway runs broad and smooth
acroSh the hills and it's clear sailing except for a nasty
hazard known as a speed trap around a hole in the
road called San Juan Bautista. The cops all bring
dates and park in the eucalyptus groves till you blaze
hy.
Oh yeah, the old sturgeon who plays the siren in
Morgan Hill was driving a maroon 1949 Mercury
sedan the last time we talked. Now that I think of it
they must have a "Vic Palmieri Memorial Shingle"
in every city hull between here and LA.

Now for the back nine. The drive across the central
valley inland is one of the most scenic routes in
America. The wooded hills, the green rolling meadows
dotted with herds of oil wells, and the quaint thatched
huts of the Scandinavian villages that line the way
create an impression of pastoral serenity unequalled
this side'of the Swiss Alps.
Eut the most breathtaking vista of all . . . the sight
that will take your breath away if the smell hasn't
done so already . . . comes when you sight from afar
the gleaming alabaster towers of that city in the sky
. . . Blackwell's Coiners.
Here is one of the lev/ remaining agricultural com
munities of our land ... so agricultural, in fact,
they've been thinking of plowing it under. I don't
want to call it rustic, but they couldn't even get their
rest rooms registered.
Climax of the trip south is the treacherous, tortuous
trail over the Southern Andes known as the Grapevine.
This of course is where the famous Donner Party
was caught by a terrific snowstorm which brought
100-foot drifts into the pass. Legend has it the storm
ruined the party but nobody minded because they dis
covered they could make a fortune selling snow cones
to the Indians.
Once over the hump you emerge onto the broad,
fertile plain of the San Fernando Valley . . . that is
if you're a peasant and don't live in Pasadena. You
are now practically in the city limits of Los Angeles
so at least half of the journey is over.
Remember, lrorn here on in there are only two
things on a car . . . the horn and the accelerator . . .
just lean on both and go, or your life won't be worth
a plugged nickel in L.A.
Thas all, chillun . . . drive carefully, cheer like
mad, and shed a tear lor the three of us whom you've
left holding the fort with nothing to do but drink . . .
heh, heh, heh. . . .
THOUGHT FOR BIG GAME NIGHT
C'mon, write that check,
And remember, honey,
What the heck . . .
It's only money.

was caught by a terrific snowstorm which brought
100-foot drifts into the pass. Legend has it the storm
ruined the party but nobody minded because they dis
covered they could make a fortune selling snow cones
to the Indians.
Once over the hump you emerge onto the broad,
fertile plain of the San Fernando Valley . . . that is
if you're a peasant and don't live in Pasadena. You
are now practically in the city limits of Los Angeles
so at least half of the journey is over.
Remember, lrorn here on in there are only two
things on a car . . . the horn and the accelerator . . .
just lean on both and go, or your life won't be worth
a plugged nickel in L.A.
Thas all, chillun . . . drive carefully, cheer like
mad, and shed a tear lor the three of us whom you've
left holding the fort with nothing to do but drink . . .

THOUGHT FOR BIG GAME NIGHT
C'mon, write that check,
And remember, honey,
What the heck . . .
It's only money.

From what I hear, the road to Westwood this week
end will witness the greatest mass movement since
Mohammed went to Mecca in 1932 (if it hadn't been for
the depression, he'd still be with us). So far I know

of exactly three people around
here who aren't making the trip—
me and the two brothers who run
Kossott's.
1 asked them why they weren't
going and they told me they
couldn't afford it . .. seems they've
already spent my next month's
allowance. But we figure if we
start in on that keg early enough

Saturday morning, by gametime we'll float into the
Coliseum (yeah, the gag sunk, I know).
Anyway, for the benefit of those poor Drofnats who
hail lrom the dreary wastes and icy blasts of the
Northwest, and who have yet to taste the enchant
ment of a weekend in the land of milk and honey, here
are a few tips from an old commuter.
The first nine holes of the course stretch from
campus through Gilroy and Salinas to Paso Robles
. . . par, about three hours and 15 minutes. Now that
Bayshore bypasses San Jose this part is a breeze, but I
remember when San Jose cops had it in for journeying
Stanford students to the point where you held out
youi driver's license the moment you crossed the city
limits and they handed you a little pink carbon good
for at least ten bucks or ten days.
They were so dependable I think their mothers
were scared by the toll gates on the Bay Bridge.
Outside San Jose fairway runs broad and smooth
acroSh the hills and it's clear sailing except for a nasty
hazard known as a speed trap around a hole in the
road called San Juan Bautista. The cops all bring
dates and park in the eucalyptus groves till you blaze
hy.
Oh yeah, the old sturgeon who plays the siren in
Morgan Hill was driving a maroon 1949 Mercury
sedan the last time we talked. Now that I think of it
they must have a "Vic Palmieri Memorial Shingle"
in every city hull between here and LA.

Now for the back nine. The drive across the central
valley inland is one of the most scenic routes in
America. The wooded hills, the green rolling meadows
dotted with herds of oil wells, and the quaint thatched
huts of the Scandinavian villages that line the way
create an impression of pastoral serenity unequalled
this side'of the Swiss Alps.
Eut the most breathtaking vista of all . . . the sight
that will take your breath away if the smell hasn't
done so already . . . comes when you sight from afar
the gleaming alabaster towers of that city in the sky
. . . Blackwell's Coiners.
Here is one of the lev/ remaining agricultural com
munities of our land ... so agricultural, in fact,
they've been thinking of plowing it under. I don't
want to call it rustic, but they couldn't even get their
rest rooms registered.
Climax of the trip south is the treacherous, tortuous
trail over the Southern Andes known as the Grapevine.
This of course is where the famous Donner Party
was caught by a terrific snowstorm which brought
100-foot drifts into the pass. Legend has it the storm
