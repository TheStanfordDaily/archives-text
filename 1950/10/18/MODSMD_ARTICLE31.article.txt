# CAMPUS OPINION
## No More 'Ugh' 
### 
To the Editor,
Now, before it is too late, I wish to express what I
believe to be an almost unanimous Stanford senti
ment in recommending that "Li'l Ugh's" next stunt
Le an immediate and permanent vanishing act. He
could do nothing more gratifying.
Daily publicity efforts notwithstanding, I think it
i lear that Ugh is not, in any way, an "answer to
Oskie." He is rather an obvious and ineffectual mimic
ol Oskie; even his misguided progenitors must have
winced a bit at Saturday's studied, amateurish simu
lation of the Berkeley Bear. Ugh's hapless antics are
far more a tribute than an answer to Cal's Oskie.
The Daily has said, too, that Ugh is a "leader of
student spirit." He is not that, either. The only student
reactions to Ugh's Saturday imitations were apathy
or comment such as, "Oh God, not again!!"
Ugh stands to do Stanford prestige considerable
harm. Witness the example of Cal and the theft of
the Axe Yell. No one respects Cal for having appro
priated the yell —and the theft has boomeranged in
that Cal's rooting section is made to appear second
rate to Stanford's whenever the yell is given.
We have just as obviously stolen the Oskie idea.
I sincerely request that Ugh deface no more Stan
ford football games.
