To the Editor:
We were happy to note at the game with Santa Clara
Saturday, that the Stanford rooters did not "boo" the

referee when we received a 15-yard penalty for offen
s.ive holding in the fourth quarter, as did the Santa
Clara rooters when they received the same penalty
for the same offense.
However, we wonder if our side might not have
booed louder il we had been behind as was Santa
Clara. Why do we wonder? Because we were both
astounded and disgusted to see college men acting like
grammar school kids.
If there is any doubt as to what we refer, let it be
known that we, the undersigned, consider the throw
ing of paper containers and lids childish and imma
ture, and exceedingly inconsiderate of those who were
interested in watching the game which was in progress
at the time.
Presumably this form of entertainment was started
by the Palo Alto grammar school children, who were
somehow allowed to infiltrate into the front rows of
the rooting section, but it was speedily taken up by
the very persons who should have been an example
of conduct to the younger generation, and to our
alumni and our guests from Santa Clara as well.
It might be well if the University put a little more
emphasis on social development in the entrance re
quirements, and a little less on scholastic achieve
ment. It might also be a good thing if the grammar
school children were kept out of the rooting section for
the good of the college students who seem to be so
susceptible to suggestion.
