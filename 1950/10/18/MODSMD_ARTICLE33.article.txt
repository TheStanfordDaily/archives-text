DRIVE ON RED CAPITALâ€”The UN's multipronged drive on
Pyongyang (1). Red capital, rolled toward a climax. One Repub
lic of Korea spearhead reached Suan (2), just 38 miles from
Pyongyang. To the south, the U.S. Ist Cavalry pushed two miles
past Namchonjom, as U.S. 24th Division, reported in action for
the first time in the new offensive, captured Yonan (3), and drove
toward Haeju. On the east coast, the ROK 3rd Division reached
Chowon (4), about 20 miles from important industrial cities of
Hungnam and Hamhung. From Yonghung, a U.S.-led taik force
drove west in an effort to save an estimated 1,000 American war
prisoners last reported in a railroad tunnel near Inhung (4).
