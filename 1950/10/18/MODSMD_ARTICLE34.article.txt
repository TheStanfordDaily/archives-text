# CARS ON CAMPUS
## Parking Situation Is Critical, Says Davis 
### 
"There are just too many cars on
the campus," said Police Chief Gor
don Davis yesterday. He was ex
plaining what he termed "the ex
tremely critical parking situation."
He listed several underlying
causes that contributed to the sit
uation. First he discussed the peo
ple who drive to class when they
live close enough to walk. If these
people walked to classes, persons
driving from out of town would
have more space to park, he pointed
out.
Late risers also contribute to the
problem, he said. These are the
people who cut the time so closely
they have to park right next to the
Quad to make class on time.
By the time the late riser gets to
school, all the parking spaces near
the Quad are taken, so he parks
illegally, hoping he can get away
with it.
The third contributing reason ad
vanced by Davis was that too many
persons are ignorant of parking
regulations. One student fined for
parking in a reserved parking area
complained he didn't know what
"reserved parking" meant. He paid
the customary $2 fine.
Reserved parking areas are for
persons who have reserved parking
permits.
A common violation is parking on
the street running from the Engi
neering corner to the Geology cor
ner. This area is closed to all but
emergency traffic from Monday
through Saturday noon, including
nights.
Students are misled into parking
there because the center post has
been removed, Davis said. He ex
plained that crippled people have
special authorization to drive with
in the area and that the center post
is left out because these persons
could not get out of their cars and
remove the post.
Parking near a painted curbing
is another violation which com

monly occurs. A red zone means no
; parking at any time. A white zone
! means that passengers may be dis
; charged or picked up there, but the
! driver cannot leave the car.
Davis listed speeding as the most
! serious violation that occurs on the
campus. Campus speed limit is 20
miles per hour, and on roads lead
! ing to the campus, 25 miles per
hour.
The heavy fines levied on speed
ing are necessary to prevent acci
dents, Davis claimed. Because of
the high fine, 50 cents per mile in
excess of the speed limit for the
first offense, speeding has been
! curbed and accidents reduced.
Penalty for the second offense is
75 cents a mile, $1 for the third of
j fense, and on the fourth offense the
auto is banned from the campus.
As a tribute to the high fine pol-
I'icy, Davis said that few people are
1 guilty of a second offense.


WHAT'S THAT?
—Two dollars, please

! driver cannot leave the car.
Davis listed speeding as the most
! serious violation that occurs on the
campus. Campus speed limit is 20
miles per hour, and on roads lead
! ing to the campus, 25 miles per
hour.
The heavy fines levied on speed
ing are necessary to prevent acci
dents, Davis claimed. Because of
the high fine, 50 cents per mile in
excess of the speed limit for the
first offense, speeding has been
! curbed and accidents reduced.
Penalty for the second offense is
75 cents a mile, $1 for the third of
j fense, and on the fourth offense the
auto is banned from the campus.
As a tribute to the high fine pol-
I'icy, Davis said that few people are
1 guilty of a second offense.


WHAT'S THAT?
—Two dollars, please
"There are just too many cars on
the campus," said Police Chief Gor
don Davis yesterday. He was ex
plaining what he termed "the ex
tremely critical parking situation."
He listed several underlying
causes that contributed to the sit
uation. First he discussed the peo
ple who drive to class when they
live close enough to walk. If these
people walked to classes, persons
driving from out of town would
have more space to park, he pointed
out.
Late risers also contribute to the
problem, he said. These are the
people who cut the time so closely
they have to park right next to the
Quad to make class on time.
By the time the late riser gets to
school, all the parking spaces near
the Quad are taken, so he parks
illegally, hoping he can get away
with it.
The third contributing reason ad
vanced by Davis was that too many
persons are ignorant of parking
regulations. One student fined for
parking in a reserved parking area
complained he didn't know what
"reserved parking" meant. He paid
the customary $2 fine.
Reserved parking areas are for
persons who have reserved parking
permits.
A common violation is parking on
the street running from the Engi
neering corner to the Geology cor
ner. This area is closed to all but
emergency traffic from Monday
through Saturday noon, including
nights.
Students are misled into parking
there because the center post has
been removed, Davis said. He ex
plained that crippled people have
special authorization to drive with
in the area and that the center post
is left out because these persons
could not get out of their cars and
remove the post.
Parking near a painted curbing
is another violation which com

monly occurs. A red zone means no
; parking at any time. A white zone
! means that passengers may be dis
; charged or picked up there, but the
! driver cannot leave the car.
