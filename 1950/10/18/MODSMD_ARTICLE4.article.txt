# Ike for President
## 
### 
NEW YORKâ€”Nearly half of the
Republican state chairmen across
the nation would like to sec Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower run for
President in 1952, a survey showed
today.
The state chairmen made it clear
that they "like Ike" even though
many think it's still too early to be
worrying about 1952. None came
out against Eisenhower, but many
refused comment.
