# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry

### 
Hold onto your hats, kids, here we go. The Big Red Machine, unbeaten,
untied, and untried, takes the big plunge Saturday afternoon in Smog
town, USA. It has been a nice quiet trip so far this season—like the first
minute on a roller-coaster ride. Well, we've been towed to the brink and
now the fug starts.
The obvious truth of the matter is that neither you nor I nor the team
nor the coaches KNOW whether or not Stanford has a football team this
year. Granted, there are some indications that lead us to BELIEVE that
we do. Saturday we find out for sure.
UCLA those baby blue things-that-Truman-called-Pearson—are a good
club. However, they dashed off the last two weeks and booted a pair of
bull games to Washington and Illinois, also tv/o very good ball teams. The
Washington game was anybody's ballgame, Stanford scout Dutch Feliring
tells me. It happened that the Huskies won it (by the margin of an after
point, 21-20). Had the game been a lew minutes longer cr a few shorter,
(he Bruins might have won. It was that tight and—with due respect to you
north landers—there is no reason to suspect that UCLA is any worse a foot
ball team than is Washington.
Against the lllini last week the roof fell in on Br'er Bruin. In three
pr< v i<iiis tangles (Oregon, 28-0, Washington State, 42-0, and Washing
ton) the Bruins had neither fumbled (when it hurt them) or had a pass
intercepted. Against the midwesterners Friday night the healthy lads
ol Hank Sanders fumbled six times into the arms of the invaders from
( hicagoland, and had three passes intercepted. Thus, the Bruin offense
was stymied no less than nine times because of such mishaps.
Admittedly Illinois is a very fine aggregation, as is Stanford (we think).
But the point is that Stanford cannot count on Bruin aid next Saturday
when it ccmes to interchanging the football.
The difference in the Stanford-UCLA game, to my way of thinking, will
iyj in which team wants to win the most. The Bruins, in order to have any
kind of a season this year, will have to beat Stanford. They've dropped a
couple of tough ones, and now they've got to come back. If they can take
us, they'll be back on the Rose Bowl train. If they don't, they will be out
ol the winners' circle until the next time around. They know it, and so to
them THIS is the big one. The turning point of their season.
Stanford, 011 the other hand, has even more reason to play football—
I mean real football. First of all, our season, likewise, hinges 011 Satur
day's lilt. We haven't heat anybody yet, so—in more ways than one—
this is our opener. The kids have been nice, now we face a football team
that likes to rock and sock. If we don't beat the Bruins, facing Wash
ington. USC, and Cal—not to mention Woo-Poo's man-eaters—will be
a decidedly gloomy prospect.
Secondly, the guys with the red shirts are, and well should be, still wear
ing red faces after the 14-7 licking the Uclans administered to us last year.
We outplayed them, outran them, and outpassed them in the Stanford Sta
dium last season. UCLA made more touchdowns. And, remember, the
Bruins had 14 points against us before they allowed us to tally our pitiful 7.
Stanford was pretty badly humiliated by deah ol' Red Sanders in 1949. It
was the only thing that kept us from having a good season. The 37-man
LA travel squad can't, shouldn't, and better not forget that there is an old
score to settle.
Another good reason for the Injuns' playing their best ball Saturday, is
that more than half of them are playing in front of a "hometown" crowd
lor the first time this year. Their folks and friends have been given the im
pression (perhaps erroneous) that Stee-an-ford-dee has a great bunch of
'ootball players. They will find out Saturday.
Frankly, nice people, this UCLA tilt scares me to death. I want us to
beat those bal>y-blue-ba Bruins so badly, I can taste it. Somehow,
this week, I've developed an intense mad-011 for the Westwooders. I
think the team feels the same way. The stakes are 011 the table. But I
won't buy that "we always do K ood in the Coliseum" stuff. The word
"always" simply doesn't apply in football. The kids have got to blast.
They've got to "kill 'em" every play. And for Gawd's sake, won't some
body please block!
Excuse me if this sounds like a pep talk, or a Dick Hylanc! special. I'm
just irked at UCLA. Baby blue. Baby blue. Baby blue. Nerts. I think the
team has long since decided that they are going to have a little blast-time
i.i Smogtown next week. They think they are a good football team, and I
think they'll prove it Saturday.
And. while I'll settle for a one-point victory, this week's Stanford predic
tion calls for the Schwartzmen to do a mangle job on the Bruins to the tune
ol 21 points. I would like to make it 121, because I just don't like baby blue.
But 1 II settle for one—twenty-one.
