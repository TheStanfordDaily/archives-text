# Cards Prep For Bruins
## 
### 
The lights were on last night at
the varsity practice field as the
Indians went through light contact
work and signal drills in prepara
tion for Saturday's conference game
at the Los Angeles Coliseum against
UCLA.
Assistant Coaches Dutch Fehring
and Mai El ward tutored the Card
defensive unit as the jayvee squad
ran Bruin single - wing patterns.
Pass defense was stressed, with
Jack Bickel doing the tossing for
the JV's.
On the other side of the field the
offensive units were put through
a signal drill by Head Coach
Schwartz and Line Coach Phil
Bengtson. This was strictly no-con
tact work, with the accent on tim
ing of running plays.
The Indians' second conference
outing, as announced yesterday,
will find wingman Bruce Van Al
styne on the sidelines with an in
jured knee. Van Alstyne will be
fitted for a leg brace today but is
not expected to practice until some
time next week. He will, in all
probability, be ready to go by the
time Stanford meets Washington
next week.
No new injuries were reported in
the Card camp. Norm Manoogian
and Owen Powell, out the last two
weeks, both took part in yester
day's signal drill and expect to see
at least part-time action in the Col
iseum.
Bob Scott is still regarded as a
probable starter Saturday; and both
Bob White and Leon King, injured
slightly against Santa Clara, have
been given definite green lights for
action this week.
