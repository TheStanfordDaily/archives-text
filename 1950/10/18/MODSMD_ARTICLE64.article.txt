About noon yesterday I wandered
into one of the barber shops in Palo
Aito. Sitting in the first chair hav- ;
ing his hair cut was an old gentle- !
man.
"I was rooting ror Stanford Sat- |
urday but I took Santa Clara and j
that 21 points," he said. "Hot ri
valry like that, a nian'd be crazy
not to. By the way, who're the In- !
dians playing this week?"
"UCLA," I answered.
"Should be a good game," he said.

"Remember that Cal game last year.
Thought Stanford was going to
whip 'em. I guess the Indians just
ran out of gas, though. That's go
ing to be some game this year.
Fur'll be flying all over the place!"
The man paid the barber, walked
out, got into a 1950 Cadillac and
drove away.
That man was Raymond Tyrus
Cobb, the greatest baseball player
of all time.
