# STUNNED!
## Foreign Students Hit Farm 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
llow are you going to get them
back to Puree after they've seen the
Farm?
For Stanford's seven foreign
scholarship students their first
three weeks on the Farm have been
something new ;tn<i different in the
way of college life.
Hans Rossi, political economy
Stud en t from Switzerland, ex
plained that since the majority of
European universities have no
campuses and nu student resi
dences, there are no integrated stu
dent activities associated with the
university.
Living in student dormitories and
fraternities was rated by the stu
dents as one of their most unique
experiences, after attending colleges
abroad in the heart of such cities
as Paris, Zurich, or Tokyo.
For Francisco Goitia Benet, a so
ciology major from Madrid, the
present fraternity initiations re
mind him of similar escapades that
students at the Beaux-Arts School
in Paris go through, although he
considered the latter not quite so
rough.
Differences in Education
Francisco and Jeanne Marie Vi 1 —
lar, of France, who have both stud
ied in Paris, pointed out some of
the differences between the Ameri
can and European systems of get
ting an education.
Students in Europe are complete
ly on their own. Whether you at
tend classes, read the assigned texts,
or turn in papers is entirely up to
you. There are no tests given dur
ing semesters, but your whole
grade depends 011 the examination
given at the end of each year.
Some students, according to
Francisco, don't begin to work until
the last few months, which makes
life quite haggard before taking
that year-full exam. Jeanne Mario
added that most of the students
arc supporting themselves through
school and have to keep up their
grades if they wish to remain. Thus
•there is less time-out for play than
in our three-quarter system.
Lectures and professors at Euro
pean universities present another
striking difference. There are al
most no class discussions, and if a
student misses a word during the
lecture he can't interrupt the pro
fessor to find out what it's all about.
To consult the professor after class
is not a very popular tradition.
Typical Classroom
Jeanne Marie described a scene
in a typical classroom — 500 stu
dents crammed into a lecture hall;

if you come in late and sit in the
back, you strain your ears trying
to catch the professor's words while
chattering classmates beside you
contribute their share of distrac
tion.
A European student must also be
self - sufficient when it comes 10
making out his program, since there
are no advisers. When you attain
the higher ranks of knowledge and
show outstanding ability, the fac
ulty might become interested in
you, but as for the undergraduate,
he is completely on his own.
On their second day at Stanford,
the students witnessed something
new in the way of sports—a foot
ball game. The girls were com
pletely bewildered. Reiko Ishikawa,
from Japan, confessed that she was

dazed by the flying pom-poms . . .
that she never thought girls could
yell so loudly. But soon she and
Jeanne were shouting, "C'mon, you
Indians!" Reiko was relieved when
she learned that football only lasted
one season. She added that at home
in Tokyo baseball was the current
rage.
Football and Bull Fights
Francisco decided, that football
was similar to a bull fight when it
came to activity in the grandstands
. . . on the field the only difference
was that there was a ball instead
of a bull.
Karl Kisler. a former student at
the University of Vienna, related
some unusual experiences he had
during his first week at Stanford.
Each time he would meet one of

the boys from the fraternity house
where he was staying, this same
boy would ask, "How are you, !
Karl?" This confused Karl, espe
cially when the question was re- !
peated throughout the day. He tried |
to give his well-wishing friend a j
complete answer, as it is customary J
to do in Austria, but before he |
could finish the boy had gone away. |
Karl was also amazed when he j
saw a number of students walking I
around in bright - colored shirts,
which he thought were pajama
tops. So wishing to join in the in- i
formal attire, he donned a pair of j
shorts (the usual outfit for men in
Austria) which attracted a great j
deal of attention on Quad. (Ameri- j
can girls who were traveling in Eu- [
rope this summer received the same i

look when they wore pedal-push- j
ers.)
Stanford Women
As for American women, Stan
ford women in particular, Claes
Henrik de la Chapelle from Fin
land said that it was the opinion in
Europe that American women are
spoiled, but Stanford has done
much to change his opinion. Claes j
is amazed by the multitude of cars. I
and wishes he were among the j
lucky ones.
Klaus Vollmer rushed in as the
meeting was ending, dressed in the
Bavarian outfit of lederhosen
(leather pants). He just had time
to say that Stanford was great,
which seemed to be the general
consensus of opinion.

to catch the professor's words while
chattering classmates beside you
contribute their share of distrac
tion.
A European student must also be
self - sufficient when it comes 10
making out his program, since there
are no advisers. When you attain
the higher ranks of knowledge and
show outstanding ability, the fac
ulty might become interested in
you, but as for the undergraduate,
he is completely on his own.
On their second day at Stanford,
the students witnessed something
new in the way of sports—a foot
ball game. The girls were com
pletely bewildered. Reiko Ishikawa,
from Japan, confessed that she was

dazed by the flying pom-poms . . .
that she never thought girls could
yell so loudly. But soon she and
Jeanne were shouting, "C'mon, you
Indians!" Reiko was relieved when
she learned that football only lasted
one season. She added that at home
in Tokyo baseball was the current
rage.
Football and Bull Fights
Francisco decided, that football
was similar to a bull fight when it
came to activity in the grandstands
. . . on the field the only difference
was that there was a ball instead
of a bull.
Karl Kisler. a former student at
the University of Vienna, related
some unusual experiences he had
during his first week at Stanford.
Each time he would meet one of

the boys from the fraternity house
where he was staying, this same
boy would ask, "How are you, !
Karl?" This confused Karl, espe
cially when the question was re- !
peated throughout the day. He tried |
to give his well-wishing friend a j
complete answer, as it is customary J
to do in Austria, but before he |
could finish the boy had gone away. |
Karl was also amazed when he j
saw a number of students walking I
around in bright - colored shirts,
which he thought were pajama
tops. So wishing to join in the in- i
formal attire, he donned a pair of j
shorts (the usual outfit for men in
Austria) which attracted a great j
deal of attention on Quad. (Ameri- j
can girls who were traveling in Eu- [
rope this summer received the same i

look when they wore pedal-push- j
ers.)
Stanford Women
As for American women, Stan
ford women in particular, Claes
Henrik de la Chapelle from Fin
land said that it was the opinion in
Europe that American women are
spoiled, but Stanford has done
much to change his opinion. Claes j
is amazed by the multitude of cars. I
and wishes he were among the j
lucky ones.
Klaus Vollmer rushed in as the
meeting was ending, dressed in the
Bavarian outfit of lederhosen
(leather pants). He just had time
to say that Stanford was great,
which seemed to be the general
consensus of opinion.

Farm?
For Stanford's seven foreign
scholarship students their first
three weeks on the Farm have been
something new ;tn<i different in the
way of college life.
Hans Rossi, political economy
Stud en t from Switzerland, ex
plained that since the majority of
European universities have no
campuses and nu student resi
dences, there are no integrated stu
dent activities associated with the
university.
Living in student dormitories and
fraternities was rated by the stu
dents as one of their most unique
experiences, after attending colleges
abroad in the heart of such cities
as Paris, Zurich, or Tokyo.
For Francisco Goitia Benet, a so
ciology major from Madrid, the
present fraternity initiations re
mind him of similar escapades that
students at the Beaux-Arts School
in Paris go through, although he
considered the latter not quite so
rough.
Differences in Education
Francisco and Jeanne Marie Vi 1 —
lar, of France, who have both stud
ied in Paris, pointed out some of
the differences between the Ameri
can and European systems of get
ting an education.
Students in Europe are complete
ly on their own. Whether you at
tend classes, read the assigned texts,
or turn in papers is entirely up to
you. There are no tests given dur
ing semesters, but your whole
grade depends 011 the examination
given at the end of each year.
Some students, according to
Francisco, don't begin to work until
the last few months, which makes
life quite haggard before taking
that year-full exam. Jeanne Mario
added that most of the students
arc supporting themselves through
school and have to keep up their
grades if they wish to remain. Thus
•there is less time-out for play than
in our three-quarter system.
Lectures and professors at Euro
pean universities present another
striking difference. There are al
most no class discussions, and if a
student misses a word during the
lecture he can't interrupt the pro
fessor to find out what it's all about.
To consult the professor after class
is not a very popular tradition.
Typical Classroom
Jeanne Marie described a scene
in a typical classroom — 500 stu
dents crammed into a lecture hall;

if you come in late and sit in the
back, you strain your ears trying
to catch the professor's words while
chattering classmates beside you
contribute their share of distrac

consensus of opinion.

llow are you going to get them
back to Puree after they've seen the
Farm?
For Stanford's seven foreign
scholarship students their first
three weeks on the Farm have been
something new ;tn<i different in the
way of college life.
Hans Rossi, political economy
Stud en t from Switzerland, ex
plained that since the majority of
European universities have no
campuses and nu student resi
dences, there are no integrated stu
dent activities associated with the
university.
Living in student dormitories and
fraternities was rated by the stu
dents as one of their most unique
experiences, after attending colleges
abroad in the heart of such cities
as Paris, Zurich, or Tokyo.
For Francisco Goitia Benet, a so
ciology major from Madrid, the
present fraternity initiations re
mind him of similar escapades that
students at the Beaux-Arts School
in Paris go through, although he
considered the latter not quite so
rough.
Differences in Education
Francisco and Jeanne Marie Vi 1 —
lar, of France, who have both stud
ied in Paris, pointed out some of
the differences between the Ameri
can and European systems of get
ting an education.
Students in Europe are complete
ly on their own. Whether you at
tend classes, read the assigned texts,
or turn in papers is entirely up to
you. There are no tests given dur
ing semesters, but your whole
grade depends 011 the examination
given at the end of each year.
Some students, according to
Francisco, don't begin to work until
the last few months, which makes
life quite haggard before taking
that year-full exam. Jeanne Mario
added that most of the students
arc supporting themselves through
school and have to keep up their
grades if they wish to remain. Thus
•there is less time-out for play than
in our three-quarter system.
Lectures and professors at Euro
pean universities present another
striking difference. There are al
most no class discussions, and if a
student misses a word during the
lecture he can't interrupt the pro
fessor to find out what it's all about.
To consult the professor after class
is not a very popular tradition.
Typical Classroom
Jeanne Marie described a scene
in a typical classroom — 500 stu
dents crammed into a lecture hall;

if you come in late and sit in the
back, you strain your ears trying
to catch the professor's words while
chattering classmates beside you
contribute their share of distrac
tion.
A European student must also be
self - sufficient when it comes 10
making out his program, since there
are no advisers. When you attain
the higher ranks of knowledge and
show outstanding ability, the fac
ulty might become interested in
you, but as for the undergraduate,
he is completely on his own.
On their second day at Stanford,
the students witnessed something
new in the way of sports—a foot
ball game. The girls were com
pletely bewildered. Reiko Ishikawa,
from Japan, confessed that she was

dazed by the flying pom-poms . . .
that she never thought girls could
yell so loudly. But soon she and
Jeanne were shouting, "C'mon, you
Indians!" Reiko was relieved when
she learned that football only lasted
one season. She added that at home
in Tokyo baseball was the current
rage.
Football and Bull Fights
Francisco decided, that football
was similar to a bull fight when it
came to activity in the grandstands
. . . on the field the only difference
was that there was a ball instead
of a bull.
Karl Kisler. a former student at
the University of Vienna, related
some unusual experiences he had
during his first week at Stanford.
Each time he would meet one of

the boys from the fraternity house
where he was staying, this same
boy would ask, "How are you, !
Karl?" This confused Karl, espe
cially when the question was re- !
peated throughout the day. He tried |
to give his well-wishing friend a j
complete answer, as it is customary J
to do in Austria, but before he |
could finish the boy had gone away. |
Karl was also amazed when he j
saw a number of students walking I
around in bright - colored shirts,
which he thought were pajama
tops. So wishing to join in the in- i
formal attire, he donned a pair of j
shorts (the usual outfit for men in
Austria) which attracted a great j
deal of attention on Quad. (Ameri- j
can girls who were traveling in Eu- [
rope this summer received the same i

look when they wore pedal-push- j
ers.)
Stanford Women

ford women in particular, Claes
Henrik de la Chapelle from Fin
