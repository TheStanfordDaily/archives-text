## Kerr Urges Formosa Investigation by UN 
### 
Ending his talk last night on the currcnt position of Formosa in
world politics, George Kerr urged the United States support of a
UN investigation of the Chinese Nationalist stronghold.
"One voice is missing from discussions of what to do with For
mosa, and that is what do the Formosan-Chinese people them-

selves think of all this," said Profes
sor Kerr, after tracing the three ma
jor stages of Formosan history, each
representing a phase of subjugation
or period of limited self-government.
The Formosan-Chinese, according
to Professor Kerr, want neither the
Peking Communists nor Generalis
simo Chiang Kai-Shek. "Across the
hundred-mile moat of channel wa
ters, the Chinese Communists claim
the right to liberate the Formosan
people from wicked American im
perialist and capitalist aggression,"
he said. *
' The Generalissimo expresses con
fidence that if we just give him a year
or two. more gold, and more ammuni
tion, he will retake the whole of Con
tinental China. From this distance
this bold claim looks something like
a tail attempting earnestly to wag a
dog."
The lecturer stressed the fact that
the Formosans themselves look to
ward the United States lor inspira
tion and help. They are tired, he
said, of being treated as "peripheral,
sccond-class, conquered subjects."
Professor Kerr also cited the Na
tionalist "economic pillage in 194fi"
after the surrender of Japan. Japa
nese defeat was entirely the work of
the United States, the Formosans are
convinced, he remarked.
Reviewing past history of the
island, which has now been turned
into a strong military base, Kerr told
of the period of Chinese colonization,
Japanese "police government," and
finally the Nationalist regime. The
Formosans have consistently pressed
for equal footing with the mother
I country.
