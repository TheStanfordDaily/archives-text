## UN 						Approves New U.S. Military Plan 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, Oct. 18 (UP)â€”
The United Nations' top political
committee today approved the rev
olutionary American plan to ear
mark national troops for use by the
veto - free General Assembly to
meet aggression.
The vote on the key paragraph
was 48-5, with six abstentions.
This assured final passage by the
full General Assembly, since it was
far more than the two-thirds ma
jority needed.
The American-designed plan, co
sponsored by six other nations,
would enable the 60-nation General
Assembly to meet on 24 hours'
notice and dispatch armed force
against an aggressor if a big-power
veto barred action by the 11-nation
Security Council.
The consensus here was that the
program to bolster the Assembly
will radically change the nature of
the UN and enable the organi
zation to Heal swiftly and vigorous
ly with any future "Korea."
