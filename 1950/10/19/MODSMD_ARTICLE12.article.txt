# 'Red' Band Southbound
## 
### 
It's Ret-away day on the Farm to
day, and getting away with the first
of the southbound rooters will be the
Stanford Band.
Eighty-eight bandsmen leave at 8
p.m. tonight from Palo Alto via a
special three-car section of the Star
light. Arrival time in Los Angeles is
8 a.m. tomorrow.
A fast-paced weekend will test the
endurance and lung capacities of the
Card music makers. Three appear
ances tomorrow and two on Saturday
plus a practice period make up the
schedule.
Tomorrow morning the Band will
represent Stanford at the coronation
of the UCLA homecoming queen.
The Stanfordites will lead ofT the sec
ond section of the extravagant parade
in Westwood tomorrow night, and
afterward they will appear at the
Bruin bonfire rally.
Saturday's half-time salute to the
"Frontier Days" theme of the UCLA
homecoming has been taking shape
here on the Farm for the past two
weeks under the direction of con
ductor Julius Shuchat and manager
Jack Blum berg. After Tuesday's
practice period, at least one thing
was definite. The gigantic human
rocking chair will make one healthy
and distinct five-yard rock.
For the finale of the nine-minute
performance, the bandsmen have
called on outside talent in the per
son of the lasso-tossing yell leader,
Jim Scott. Jim will bust through a
band-formed corall and tame a pesky
Bruin with his well-trained rope.
Saturday noon before the ball game
the Band will make their annual visit
to Clifton's Cafeteria in Los Angeles.
Here, in exchange for a few martial
tunes, the doors of the eating place
will be thrown open to the uni
formed bandsmen.
Band members not living in the
Los Angeles area will stay at UCLA
fraternities Friday night, but will
move downtown to the Alexandria
Hotel Saturday.—Gordon McKibbcn.
