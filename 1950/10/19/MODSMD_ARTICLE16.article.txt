# 'What Price Glory?'--A Production Challenge
## Problems in Casting, Sets, Costuming Told by Director 
### PAUL HARRIS 
(Editor's note: Paul Harris, whose production of "What Price
Glory?" will open the Stanford Players' fall season next week,
here explains some of the problems that the director rm:,l lacc
before the curtain goes up on opening night.)
"What Price Glory?" is a fascinating show to watch and to di
rect. It is an extremely challenging play to produce, for there are

many inherent problems which are
not immediately apparent to the
audience.
First of all, the director must
face the task of casting the play.
That is no easy job. There arc 27
characters in "What Price Glory?'"
and each one is strictly an indi
vidual.
Upon first thought it would seem
easy to cast 27 parts from the more
than 80 students who tried out.
Yet requirements such as contrasts
in voice quality, height, weight,
acting experience, and that intan
gible something called stage pres
ence had to be considered.
There were many questions to
be answered in the casting of this
particular play. Was it possible to
find a student who could play a
mocking, sarcastic, yet when the
occasion arises. gentle Captain
Flngg? Could we find a Sergeant
Quirt who could be effectively pit
ted against the "magnificently en
dowed" Flagg? And what about
casting just the right French peas
ant girl, Charmaine? These parts
be east to lend the play an air of
as well as the many others had to
truth.
Once the easting was completed,

wo began to encounter Hie many
technical problems involved in pro
ducing this World War 1 comedy.
Costumes and properties have been
the number one obstacles, since the
play will be kept in the period of
the War. Because the plot deals with
Marino Corps life, research on the
j "well-dressod gyrcnc" had to ho in
itiated in order to add authentic
flavor to the play.
It was necessary for .John Stevens
i and his production stafT to break
down all possible costume routers for
World War I uniforms, as well as
| such properties as guns, bayonets,
j tin helmets, hats, and first-aid equip
ment of World War I vintage.
In addition to these hurdles, the
play is a throe-set show, which uses
| interiors of a French manor, wine
! cellar, and tavern. In building this
i highly intricate ret. Stevens whs
faced with the problem of finding
doors, tables, and windows in au
thentic French peasant style.
A week before opening night,
most of these problems have been
solved, but not until the curtain
has pone down on the first show
' will we know the final outcome of
I our efforts.

"What Price Glory?" is a fascinating show to watch and to di
rect. It is an extremely challenging play to produce, for there are

many inherent problems which are
not immediately apparent to the
audience.
First of all, the director must
face the task of casting the play.
That is no easy job. There arc 27
characters in "What Price Glory?'"
and each one is strictly an indi
vidual.
Upon first thought it would seem
easy to cast 27 parts from the more
than 80 students who tried out.
Yet requirements such as contrasts
in voice quality, height, weight,
acting experience, and that intan
gible something called stage pres
ence had to be considered.
There were many questions to
be answered in the casting of this
particular play. Was it possible to
find a student who could play a
mocking, sarcastic, yet when the
occasion arises. gentle Captain
Flngg? Could we find a Sergeant
Quirt who could be effectively pit
ted against the "magnificently en
dowed" Flagg? And what about
casting just the right French peas
ant girl, Charmaine? These parts
be east to lend the play an air of
as well as the many others had to
truth.
Once the easting was completed,

wo began to encounter Hie many
technical problems involved in pro
ducing this World War 1 comedy.
