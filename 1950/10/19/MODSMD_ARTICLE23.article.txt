# Toynbee—Another Stanford Scoop
## 
### 
Once again, Stanford's alert faculty and ad
ministration have registered a scoop. Thanks
to their timely action and the prestige that is
Stanford, British Historian Arnold J. Toynbee
will speak to students today at 11 at Memorial
Auditorium. It will be one of the Englishman's
few appearances on the Pacific Coast before
turning eastward for Princeton next week.
Toynboe's appeal is unique, both to the stu
dent of history and the non-student.
His most famous work—"A Study of History"
—was not only a best-seller, but received top
Book of the Month Club honors. Other Toynbee
books, "Civilization on Trial," and "Civilization
and War," have earned similar receptions.
The administration has not forgotten the stu
dent body and its interest in the noted historian.
President Sterling's first wish upon learning of
Professor Toynbee's acceptance was that he
talk to the students first.
As a consequence, at 11 this morning, classes
will be dismissed, offices will be closed, and
ever / one of us will get a chance to troupe over
to Mem Aud. With tongue in cheek (because

we understand there may not be enough space
to accommodate all those who wish to attend),
we suggest you make the most of the oppor
tunity. —R.R.
