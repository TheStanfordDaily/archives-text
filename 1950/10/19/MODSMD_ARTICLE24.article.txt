# Take It Easy
## 
### 
With more and more students boarding the
Big Red Machine for the invasion of the sunny
Southland, the need for a bit of caution becomes
more and more apparent.
One or two highways, filled with about 1,000
more cars during the same 24-hour period might
put a somber note on the big weekend if driv
ers don't "play it safe."
That extra half-hour you might spend driving
55 instead of 60 miles an hour might be the dif
ference â€”the difference between your getting
back to Stanford on Monday or landing in a hos
pital in Los Angeles for several weeks.
Celebrations, parties, and dancing mix well
together but drinks, tired eyes, and heavy traf
fic form a deadly combination.
