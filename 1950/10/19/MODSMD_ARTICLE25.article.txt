# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
I left yesterday for Los Angeles. This will be the
first Session 1 have written without getting sneers
along with my Cellar-coffee breakfast. They don't
read bull Session in Los Angeles, poor unenlightened

people. And as 1 said, I'm now in
Lor Angeles. They love me in Los
Angeles. (Mother lives in Los
Angeles.)
Hie reason I left so early for the
city limits of the city without any,
is that I'm expecting a crowd for
the UCLA game, and I want to get
to the Coliseum in time to get a
good seat.

Don't worry about the first paragraph of this col
umn— Dwight Wilbur, a devout San Franciscan
(Friscoian, as we say in LA), bet me a dime I couldn't
get the big city's name in the lead five times.
Now. where were we? Oh, yes. I'm in Los Ang—
down south, and I was about to recommend to you
deah, deah people (we always use a southern accent in
LA) where to go in the Big Town, in case you decide
to skip the football game. I
First of all, there is a wonderful place to park in the
Hollywood Hills. Nice view overlooking Sunset Blvd.,
and the nicest thing about it is that it is right on
Hollywood Blvd. You go up Hollywood to Laurel
Canyon, and there it appears to end. Ah, but don't be
fooled. It doesn't.
'1 here is, on the far side of Laurel, a road that goes
up and to the left. That is Hollywood. Stay on it. It
tries to lose you a couple of times, but if you stay on it
ior a mile or two (mostly going uphill), you get to a
wide parking place on the left.
It is fairly easy to find, because it is the first wide
space to the left of the road and there are always five
i,i .six cars there before you. Mine is a blue Chevy
club couoe. Don't be bashful with all the people
around. The view is great, if you're interested. The
ma : of proletarians around you keep the mugger
bu''tfirs away. And besides all the people up there are
gtu ranteed to Ijc* doing exactly the same thing you are.
K ptcially i t commended after dark with a gurl.
ft you should be so unfortunate as to be unaccom
p. nittl by females (Stanford or otherwise) remember

that the Burbank and the Follies are strictly for peas
ants. (I'm the bald guy in the front row.) Instead,
hit the outskirts of town. There is a place called the
Colony Club and it's about 15,000 blocks out on West
ern in Gardena.
Just drive out Western, until you come to it on the
right hand side of the road. It seems like you're about
to drive into the ocean, but just keep on going; you
can't miss the blonde on the neon sign.
The Colony Club features moderately high prices
(you get robbed), very poor likker, masses of USC stu
dents, arid five naked wimmin. No Admission. Give
my best to Ginger who is the red-head.
If you are in a rah-rah-rah mood, as I will be in,
you might take in the LA Stanford Club's shindig at
the Beverly Hills Hotel. Essentials: one dollar, no
reservations, G to 9:30 Friday night. Doc Sterling and
Marchie Schwartz will be there to speak. Personally,
I think you'll prefer Ginger, but just thought I would
throw it in.
For dinner for you and the fem? Say, you ARE a
spender. Try the Santa Ynez Inn about a half-mile
from the beach out Sunset. There are easier and
quicker ways, but the safest is to just meander out
Sunset through the Indian country until you get there.
Great seafood, great steaks, great.
Also might try the La Cienega strip: Lowry's (Prime
Ribs only), Tail of the Cock, The Elbow Room, Dell's,
oi the Ready Room.
Personally, I'm drinking my supper at the Bantam
Cock, just a bit further down the road.
On the Sunset Strip (oh, you rich, rich people)
there is always Giro's, Mocambo, etc. If Malu Gatica
is still at the Mocambo, it might be worth the invest
ment. Great singer. But still I think you'd prefer
Ginger.
For eating on the Strip, try Bublinskis or Bit of
Sweden. I'm the guy at the counter at Schwab's
Drugstore.
Me? I'm going to see Virginia at Larry Potter's
Alibi Room on Ventura Blvd. in the Valley. Either
that or the party the bros. are giving. Could take in
the Coconut Grove if I'm in a high-schoolish mood
and the Gurl brings her mad money. And, then,
there's Ginger.
See ya at the game.
