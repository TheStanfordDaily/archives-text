Dear Mr. Raymond:
Ear.y, easy, babe! Don't get so excited! I'm having a
hard enough time. Please don't mention me in the
:aiutr sentence with that "Berpeley" Bear, it gives me
Indicngestion.
I'll admit that paunchy little cave-dweller came out
of hibernation before I came off the reservation. And
il you are going to compare us directly this year, that

makes liirn better. But remember "it takes a heap."
Give rue a chance- the road to Rossott's wasn't built
in a day.
And what's all this stuff about being an "answer to
Oskie," I'll be damned if I'll answer to him for any
thing. Even if 1 don't get a name by the end of the
reason I'll be out there as the Little Injun to lead the
"Big Ked" as far as it wants to go. (I hope I have a
chance to spend New Year's with my relatives in the
land of the "sky blue smog," along the Arroyo Seco.)
LITTLE INJUN
