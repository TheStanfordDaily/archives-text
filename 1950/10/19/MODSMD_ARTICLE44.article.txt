## 
### 
The president of a Philippine uni
versity with an enrollment of 13,000
students was a visitor on the Stan
ford campus this week*.
He is Dr. Francisco Dalupan,
head of the four-year-old Univer
| sity of the East in Manila, who is
visiting the United States, as he
| says, "to gather information about
American academic standards. My
purpose is to get the University of
the East accredited on a par with
American universities, so that its
graduates may be accepted for
postgraduate work here, and to de
termine standards for rating Phil
ippine colleges."
Dr. Dalupan's university, whose
I modern architecture was inspired
i by that of the University of Miami
I in Florida, was chartered this year
! on July 4, the fourth anniversary
of Philippine independence. It is
; supported partly by state funds and
j partly by private investment.
