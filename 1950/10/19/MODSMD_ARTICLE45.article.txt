# Bees Bombed; Cellar Cleared
## 
### 
With a DDT bomb in his right
hand, Don McGiliis inched his way
forward through the puddles of cof
fee and discarded sweet rolls out
side the Cellar yesterday morning.
Without giving the bees a chance
to escape, he threw â€” and when
the mushrooming clouds of white
smoke disappeared scores of bees
had gone to the final resting place.
Don, a member of the Grotto
Group, which was organized last
spring by ardent coffee drinkers
and bee haters, was assisted by
Nancy Keogh. Both had qualms
about the moral problem involved
in "the bomb" but felt that the
benefit to Stanford students out
weighed the terrifying precedent
they had set.
