## Midweek Musings Something New Under the Sun— It's the Cardinals on Paper by 91 
### 
If you don't like numbers, I suggest you stop reading this column now—
its jammed with figures and statistics. I'm not much of a lover of statistics
myself. But everything about Bill McColl has already been written, so
what's a guy gonna do?
Anyway, I picked up a copy of the Sporting News yesterday and idled
away a few spare moments practicing the ancient art of score-comparison.
People with an impractical bent of mind have been making comparisons
since before the days of the Inquisition and History 10; and it's popular
knowledge that they're absolutely worthless as measurements of the tom
j arative ability of football teams.
Nevertheless, saic! results are sometimes very amusing. When Notre
Dame hail its fancy win streak turned inside out by Purdue, for example,
it cleared the way for a flock of interesting statistical prognostications.
On the basis of these comparative scores, we discovered that such teams
as Duquesne, Citadel, Davidson, Furman, and Presbyterian would all be
rated above the Irish. Some of them by hefty score, too; Presbyterian, to
j ame one, figures out as 32 points better than Notre Dame.
But our favorites are a couple of schools called St. Vincent and Scranton
The former institution, which Is located in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, fields a
team which tops the Irish on paper by 3 points; Scranton has an edge of
1(5 points.
The kicker is yet to come. For our very own Indians, by this wonder
ful process, liguie to be exactly !I1 points ahead of Knute Rockne's alma
mater. If you're still with me and interested, it works like Ibis:
Purdue licked Notre Dame by 14. Miami beat the Boilermakers by 6,
limning the tutal to 20. Miami beat Villanova by six, but the subtraction
still leaves Villanova 14 ahead of Notre Dame. And Tulsa beat Villanova
by 20, DSP topped Tulsa by 9, and Stanford trampled the Dons by 48
Add 'em up—ill lying points.
Huskies Hold Longest Record
We have some more statistics:
Contrary to popular belief, the 39-game no-loss Irish streak which was
so rudely snapped by Purdue was not the longest in collegiate history. The
record actually roosts here on the Coast with Washington teams of 1007 to
19)7. During that period the Huskies won 59 and tied four without losing
once.
I'aul McM'ijrtry, big USC guard who is said to be the brains of the
Troy varsity, has replaced Michigan's Alvin Wistert as the daddy of
collegiate gridders. McMurtry is 30, first started playing high school
football way back in 1933. . . .
Of 180 major collegiate teams covered in a recent survey, 142 were dis
covered to use the T formation. Score one for Stanford and then-coach
C lark Shaugnessy, who revived the "Model-T' on the Farm in 1940.
