## 
### 
Eating club intramural rivalry |
was high yesterday as an underdog (
El Capitan squad came from behind [
to sink an El Toro powerhouse, 9-2. :
In the opening minutes of the first !
half, the "Bulls" sparked by agile j
quarterback Larry Cahn drove j
downfield toward points but were j
unable to continue the drive. El
Capitan took over and then things
began to happen: El Cap's offense
| bogged down and they were forced
i to kick—Toro blocked the kick—
I Capitan recovered—and on the next
: play Capinan and quarterback Phil
Gill was pinned behind his own
! goal line for a two - point Toro
safety.
The pigskin see-sawed back and
! forth for the remainder of the half
| as neither squad could muster the
backfield strength to overcome the
i other's intensive line play.
Well into the second half, the
Toro backfield fumbled a pitchout
and then mass confusion took place
as a Toro man ran the ball back of
his own goal line to give El Capi

tan two points and even up the
game at 2-2.
The tied score had a decided ef
fect on both teams as they took to
the air with spectacular intercep
tions and receptions. El Cap came
to life, steered by quarterback Phil
Gill, and began to drive toward pay
dirt with a strong air offensive. Gill
was sprung loose on a reverse and,
picking up beautiful down - field
blocking from Capmen El Shiman,
Nick Ziegler, and Chuck Trask, ran
60 yards for the game's only touch
down. Gill ran over for the con
version to make the tally El Capi
tan 9, El Toro 2.
Toro took to the air in a con
centrated come - back drive with
pin-point passes going from Cahn
to Skip Irving, Bill Dickenson, Bob
Powsner, and Marsh Pearlman.
Bill Cloughley, El Cap safety,
broke up the air attack by the Toro
aggregation as he intercepted on
his own 35. Capitan couldn't get up
offensive power and the ball again
moved into the Bullmen's hands.
Cahn captained his team upfield
only to again have a possible 30-
yard Toro TD pass intercepted by
Capman Wayne Estill as the final
whistle blew.
In another 4 o'clock game, Phi
Psi quarterback Elb Puckett tossed
three TD passes in the first half to
lead Phi Psi's first squad to an 18-0
victory over Fiji I.

Eating club intramural rivalry |
was high yesterday as an underdog (
El Capitan squad came from behind [
to sink an El Toro powerhouse, 9-2. :
In the opening minutes of the first !
half, the "Bulls" sparked by agile j
quarterback Larry Cahn drove j
downfield toward points but were j
unable to continue the drive. El
Capitan took over and then things
began to happen: El Cap's offense
| bogged down and they were forced
i to kick—Toro blocked the kick—
I Capitan recovered—and on the next
: play Capinan and quarterback Phil
Gill was pinned behind his own
! goal line for a two - point Toro
safety.
The pigskin see-sawed back and
! forth for the remainder of the half
| as neither squad could muster the
backfield strength to overcome the
i other's intensive line play.
Well into the second half, the
Toro backfield fumbled a pitchout
and then mass confusion took place
as a Toro man ran the ball back of
his own goal line to give El Capi

tan two points and even up the
game at 2-2.
The tied score had a decided ef
fect on both teams as they took to
the air with spectacular intercep
tions and receptions. El Cap came
to life, steered by quarterback Phil
Gill, and began to drive toward pay
dirt with a strong air offensive. Gill
was sprung loose on a reverse and,
picking up beautiful down - field
blocking from Capmen El Shiman,
Nick Ziegler, and Chuck Trask, ran
60 yards for the game's only touch
down. Gill ran over for the con
version to make the tally El Capi
tan 9, El Toro 2.
