# Connie Mack Retires
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 18 (UP)â€” j
Connie Mack ended his golden ju
bilee year with the Philadelphia
Athletics today by retiring as man
ager of the team.
In a personal message to a press
luncheon, the 87-year-old pilot an
nounced the appointment of Jimmy
Dykes as manager and Arthur H.
Ehlers, farm system head, as gen
eral manager.
Mack, tall and erect with just a
hint of moisture in his eyes, talked
with the pauses familiar in his
speech when he .said:
"I am retiring from baseball. I

am retiring as manager of the I
baseball club."
It was only under questioning
after the luncheon that he added
I that he was not giving up baseball
I entirely.
He will remain as club president,
and will travel with the team next
I season.
"While I travel with the team
j from town to town and from city
: to city, I know I will be welcome
with the new manager," Mack said
|in his well - known faltering ca
, dence.
Mack's announcement followed
the reorganization of the team after
its purchase by his sons, Hoy and
Earle Mack, last August.
