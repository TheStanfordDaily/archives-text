### 
Stanford's Braves, twice winners, I

j night when they meet California
Poly at San Luis Obispo under the j
arcs at 8.
Cal Poly, coached by former
Menlo JC mentor Ron Hughes, is
Stanford's major game prior to the
tangle with the Cal Rumbelrs.
With first - string quarterback |
| Steve Mitchell sidelined for at least
| ten days with a hip pointer, Coach
j Kimberly is not optimistic about the
| outcome of the game.
Kimberly definitely rates the
contest a toss-up and says,"The
team that gets the breaks and takes
advantage of them will win it." He
adds, "Cal Poly's offensive team will
test a Brave first defensive unit
which has yet to give up a score."
