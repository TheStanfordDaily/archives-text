The controversial personage of Gregory Rasputin has again
been brought to the screen, this time in an engrossing French film,
''Rasputin, the Mad Monk," now at San Francisco's State Theater.
The late Harry Baur creates an unforgettable characterization of
the strange monk who dominated the court of Nicholas II in the

; French film, Marcel Pagnol's ''Nais"
(or "The Country Gill") based on
the Emile Zola story. While not a
great picture like Pagnol's "The Ba
ker's Wife" nor as perceptive as his
Marius trilogy, "Nais" is a poignant
account of how a hunchback helps
the peasant girl he loves in an affair
with the city boy she loves.
Fernandel is especially good as
the hunchback, although the screen
play unfortunately lets most of his
character come out by long
speeches rather than by the sort of
action and visual expression that
Fernandel is so expert at handling.
"Nais" is often slow, too talkative,
and lacking in genuine subtlety—
but Marcel Pagnol still has a knack
of presenting human beings behav
ing very humanly—a knack that re

today's movie makers.
