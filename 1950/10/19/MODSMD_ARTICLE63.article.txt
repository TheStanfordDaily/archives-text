# Farm YMCA Organizers Meet Tonight
## 
### 
The first public meeting to organ- j
ize a YMCA on campus will be held i
tonight at 7:30 on the third floor of |
the Women's Clubhouse. Working i
committees will be elected.
All men interested in the estab
lishment of the men's "Y," which
will function similarly to the local
YWCA, are urged to attend, said
Paul Watson. Watson is the chair
man of a subcommittee which
evolved last spring from a religious
study group. *
Watson said that the organization |
"of and for campus men" is being
established so that fraternity men,
members of eating clubs, students
from the Village, and men living in i
dorms could have a common meet- I
ing ground. Service activities, fel
lowship, and discussions leading to
action are to be on the club's agen
da as soon as it starts to function.
Other members of the founding
subcommittee are John Morrow,
Rick West, and Pete Barney.
