# Virtue Triumphs In Frosh Heart
## 
### 
Glaring from the 4 West wing
bulletin hoard at Kncina last Sun
day, an announcement proclaimed
the following information: "Found
â€”one $5 bill. Who lost it?"
the bill was found in the 4 West
wing corridor last Saturday night
and tin-ned in to the wing's spon
sor. The notice Sunday morning
gave rise to at least one frank
statement from a freshman.
"I'm not so sure I'd be that
honest." he said. "I'd have to run
into it first."
Many of the freshmen, aware of
the battle that must have been
waged, commended the honest
deed. Ted Hinshaw, owner of
Lincoln's portrait, extended his
thanks to the anonymous repre
sentative of the 4 - Westerners'
code of honor.
