# Anti-Red Bill Called Hasty By McGrath
## 
### 
Attorney General J. Howard Mc-
Grath told Stanford law students yes
terday that the anti-subversive leu
islation rushed through Congress this
fall was "passed in haste and was
unwise legislation."
'"Nevertheless, the Department of
Justice will do everything in its
power to carry out the bill's pro
visions," he said. He added that the
department has a list of over 100 or
ganizations that are either Commu
nist action or Communist front
groups, and that proceedings would
soon be filed against them.
McGrath was a guest of the Stan
ford law school. He is on a West
Coast trip, and appeared on the stage
of the San Francisco Opera House
with -President Truman Tuesday
night.
The former Rhode Island Senator
and national chairman of the Demo
cratic Party had a solemn warning to
cive his audience concerning anti-
Communist legislation.
"It is the philosophy behind the
McCarran Act and other such legisla
tion which makes it most dangerous,"
he said.
He remarked that he thought Con
gress was persuaded by hysteria to
do something "tough" about the
Commies before going home to face
elections. He pointed out that Con
gress had always refused to consider
such legislation in the past.
"There is a danger concerning the
Communist Party in this country," he
conceded, "but the danger of hys
teria is also present. If our represen
tatives in Congress cannot resist this
hysteria, then unorthodoxy in re
ligion, politics, in any phase of our
lives is in danger," he emphasized.
McGrath explained to the students
how the enforcement of certain fea
tures of the subversive control legis
lation would work in actual practice.
He said that an already overbur
dened Circuit Court of Appeals
would have to handle the majority of
the proceedings dealing with sub
versive organizations, and that this
I would necessarily delay prosecution.
He also criticized the provision
making the Justice Department prove
its case by a preponderance of law.
"Because of this aspect of the bill,
I we will be forced to divulge informa-
I tion that has always been considered
j confidential," he said.
