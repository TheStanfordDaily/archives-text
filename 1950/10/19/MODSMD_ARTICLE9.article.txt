# Excom Okays ACLU Charter
## 'Stanford' Name Under Question As Members Reverse Decision 
### 
Excom ended three weeks of indecision last night when it unani
mously passed the charter of the Stanford Chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
After first passing and then suspending the charter on succes
sive meeting nights, representatives put their heads together last

•night, clarified the relationship be
tween the ACLU and the name
"Stanford," and gave the organiza
tion the official go-ahcad signal.
According to Farm ACLU repre
sentatives Carl Stover and Laurose
Becker, the organization on campus
will concern itself with action of "an
educative, non-partisan nature, e.g.
discussion groups with student and
faculty participation, investigation of
the legal procedures involved in the
protection of civil liberties, and gen
eral education in the nature of civil
liberties."
In other words, commented Stover,
all matters involving direct legal ac
tion in the courts will be taken in
the name of the Northern California
chapter of ACLU, not the Stanford
Chapter.
"Our chief aim on campus," Stover
emphasized, "would be educative."
The ACLU representative also
mentioned that the chapter will con
sider as one of its subsidiary objec
tives that of referring to the regional
chapter cases wherein Stanford stu
dents are arrested without appropri
ate warrants.

The proposal to bring a mobile
I. loud bank on campus for student
donations was vetoed by necessity
as Excoin members heard a report
from ASSU Vice President Jo
Lyon that such units "must be set
up indirectly by the government,
which has as yet taken no decisive
action."
Excoin. however, went 011 rccord
as favoring the mobile bank pro
posal, should it bccomc a possibil
ity.

In other business last night, Excom
approved three sets of all-campus
election dates, one for each quarter
of the current school year. They arc
as follows:
Autumn Quarter
Nov. l-:s—nominations arc open
Nov. 4—declinations

action."
Excoin. however, went 011 rccord
as favoring the mobile bank pro

Excom ended three weeks of indecision last night when it unani
mously passed the charter of the Stanford Chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
After first passing and then suspending the charter on succes
sive meeting nights, representatives put their heads together last

•night, clarified the relationship be
tween the ACLU and the name
"Stanford," and gave the organiza
tion the official go-ahcad signal.
According to Farm ACLU repre
sentatives Carl Stover and Laurose
Becker, the organization on campus
will concern itself with action of "an
educative, non-partisan nature, e.g.
discussion groups with student and
faculty participation, investigation of
the legal procedures involved in the
protection of civil liberties, and gen
eral education in the nature of civil
liberties."
In other words, commented Stover,
all matters involving direct legal ac
tion in the courts will be taken in
the name of the Northern California
chapter of ACLU, not the Stanford
Chapter.
"Our chief aim on campus," Stover
emphasized, "would be educative."
The ACLU representative also
mentioned that the chapter will con
sider as one of its subsidiary objec
tives that of referring to the regional
chapter cases wherein Stanford stu
dents are arrested without appropri
ate warrants.
