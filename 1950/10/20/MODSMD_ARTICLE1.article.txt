History makes sense, Profes
sor Arnold I. Toynbee told 2,500
attentive listeners who packed
Memorial Hall yesterday to hear
the noted British historian an
swer the question "Does History
Make Sense?"
He cited examples of clearly de
fined cycles in history that form a
definite pattern from which the stu
dent of natural science can find much
that is sensible.
He compared the thought of this
.school with the school of the his
torian which, Professor Toynbee

said, interprets the facts for what
they arc and makes no attempt to
relate one event in history with an
other.
"I believe the modern Western
historians are mistaken—at my own
peril—in saying history Is sense
less" he declared.
In the past, there was no question
at all whether or not history made
sense, according to the professor.
History was considered the working
of the will of God. This classical
view of history prevailed until the
end of the 18th century, when it be
came such a caricature of itself that
it was rejected by the Western world
and replaced by a secular viewpoint,
with two schools of thought.

Students of the school of natural
law who previously had only logic,
the science of the intellect, devel
oped many studies related to hu
man science — anthropology, eco
nomics, and then sociology.
By applying the principles of these
sciences to the facts of history, they
showed that there is a sensible rela
tionship between historical events.
"Modern historians, forming the
second school of thought, say his
tory does not repeat itself; that
history does not make sense," he
said. "I believe that historians arc
wrong in denying the existence of
many of the uniformities in history
found in the human sciences."
Professor Toynbee went on to

Professor Arnold J. Toynbee's
address, "The Political Future of
the Western Community," will be
broadcast directly from the stage
of Memorial Auditorium tonight
at 7:30 over KZSU.
"Does History Make Sense?"
the speech Toynbee delivered
yesterday morning, has been re
corded on tape and will l>e aired
on KZSU next week. Day and
time will be announced in The
Daily on Monday.

mention cycles in business. "On the
basis of the last centui-y and a half
since the Industrial Revolutions,

economic scientists have worked
out a series of cycles well estab
lished in alternating prosperity and
depression."
The cycles of war and peace
have also been worked out, ac
cording to Professor Toynbee.
The cycle begins with a world
war. followed by a peace of ex
haustion. Then come secondary,
subordinate wars fought to settle
issues brought up by the first
war. Then follows a lull of peace
and another world war.
The professor warned, how
ever, that because the cycle had
been repeated in the past, it did
not necessarily have to be re
peated in the future.

"The rhythm cycle has been bro- |
ken by two World Wars in our life
time," Professor Toynbee pointed
out. "That is why we are so
alarmed about the possibility of a I
third."
Here Professor Toynbee drew the
parallel between non-human and
human cycles. "Cycles of civiliza
tion are to some degree uniform. I
Look at psychology. It takes about
three generations for people to
change their nationalities. This
rule can be applied also to a re
ligious or social scale."
The same order applies to civil
izations as well as individuals,
said the professcr. "Breakdowns
of civilizations take the form of

more and more wars, resulting in
final conquering by one nation
and universal empire. This proc
ess takes about three or four cen
turies.
"What does this mean? It means
it has taken people about 400 years
to realize that they must abandon
local and national gods and uproot
national sovereignty from their
hearts in order to band together for
world government.
"When we've found all explana
tion in human history, will we have
all the answers? 1 believe that
modern Western historians are mis
taken when they say history is
senseless. They would be more
correct if they said that after we've

found all explanation in human his
tory, there is something left over,
some residue, that cannot be ex
plained.
"Does this residue make sense,
j sense of a different kind? This
brings us back to the old concept,
the view of the will of Cod. But
the Christian idea of God today
is not of a God Who imposes His
will but is rather one of a God
Who gives man the freedom to
choose what he wants.
"We in the West today feel this
responsibility of choice weighing
upon us. If God imposed His will
upon us, we would not have this
I feeling of responsibility. . .
