## Salvatierra House to Be Torn Down 
### 
The '"Alpha Salvatierra" house,
Salvacitrra, will be razed today
because of a fire which damaged
the building beyond repair.
The home blazed away while its
14 Stanford student residents were
attending the San Jose State game
September 23. The fire was only
discovered when flames burst
through the roof, and the fire de
partment wasn't notified until it
was too late to save the building.
The building was termed a "total
loss" by Dr. Anna Barnett, who
handles the business details for the
owner, Miss Helen Sutliffe. Esti
mated damage was $10,000, and Dr.
Barnett decided the building wasn't
worth repairing. It was insured for
$4,000.
The damage to personal property
owned by the student residents was
heavy. Rod Mead, fifth-year Staf
ford student and three-year resi
dent of the building, said he lost
about $1,000 worth of property. All
he saved was the jeans and jacket
he wore to the football game.
The 14 residents are spread out
around the community now. Six
live at. the Kappa Alpha house, two
in downtown Palo Alto, and one at
the Delta Chi house.
No new construction is contem
plated on the site at present.
