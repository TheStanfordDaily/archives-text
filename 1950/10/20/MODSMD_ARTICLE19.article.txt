# Big Red After Big Bad Bruin
## UCLA Is Toughest Foe Yet; Game May Answer Rose Bowl Questions 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The chips will be down tomorrow afternoon in the Los Angelor;
Coliseum when Stanford's grid Indians will draw for five of a kind
against Red Sanders' hard-luck UCLA Bruins.
Tomorrow's silver-anniversary contest of the Farm-Westwood
rivalry will mark the first true test of the season for Marchio

Schwartz's four-time winners, and
should go a long way toward an
swering the question uppermost in
the minds of Indian fans. To wit,
do the Indians really hold a Rose
Bowl hand in 1950, or wiil the
Bruins expose it as nothing but ;i
sportswriters' bluff?
The Cardinals were tabbed lonr*
before the season opened as .sure
fire Pasadena material, and to date
nothing has happened either lo
prove or to disprove the crystal
gazers' contentions. San Jose State,
Oregon State, Santa Clara, and USF
were all admittedly teams of no
better than mediocre caliber on the
days they played in the Stadium.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
were not too highly rated on (he
pre - season charts. But they
opened the season by scoring 70
points while blanking Oregon and
Washington State, before drop
ping two tough ones to Washing
ton and Illinois.

The Stanford-UCLA gajne will
he broadcast over a public ad
dress system at Rossotti's Satur
day afternoon for everyone not
making the trek south. A large
scoreboard will be set up to posl
scores, and loudspeakers will be
stationed all over Hie grounds.

The Huskies won out by one
point, while the Illini were handed
their victory on a platter of fum
bles and intercepted passes.
Those two losses, both of the
freak variety, can pretty well be
discounted when figuring the
Bruins' chances tomorrow. Except
for the fact that they have doubt
lessly instilled in the southerner:;
some extra will to win.
The oddsmakers favor Stanford
by seven points. Several develop
ments of the past week have, how
ever, definitely lowered the Indian
stock, prompting Schwartz to state
yesterday that he could not sincere
ly rate his team as better than even
money against its Southland hosts.
Reasons:
1. The loss by injuries of both
Bruce Van Alstyne and bis re
placement at right end. Bob Scot I.
2. The announcement (bat guard
Owen Powell will be shelved for
the third straight week. Powell
suffered an injured ankle against
USF.
.1. The still somewhat shaky
condition of Norm Manooqian.
The sophomore guard, like Pow
ell, hasn't seen action since the
Don contest and has not bad time
to return to top condition.
4. Schwartz's personal cstimn
tion that "UCLA has a very fine
team," after the Card headman
scouted the Bruins' losing battle
against Illinois last Friday night.
In regard to the last item.
Schwartz feels that the Bruins are
"100 per csnt improver! over las'
year, notwithstanding the loss of
Ernie Johnson."
Johnson was the spearhead in la .1
year's Stadium upset in which the
Westwooders, outgained and out
played by the Cards, took advantage
of two Stanford miscues to win
14 to 7.
"Sanders has four very good tail
backs to take Ernie's place,"
Schwartz continued, "and they're
all top-flight passers. And remem
ber that UCLA is leading the con
ference defensively and is second
offensively, ahead of us. That means
a well-balanced team."
Of the four tailbacks mentioned
by Schwartz, it appears likely
that sophomore Johnny Florence
will take first at leading
Sanders' single wing attack.
Southland reports indicate that

Bi»b Moore, usual starter at the
position, will be hampered by in
juries, as well as second-stringtv
Joe Marvin; but they'll probably
see some action.
Moore is the leading passer in
the conference right now.
One very important aspect of the
game from the fans' viewpoint will
be the personal duel between Stan
ford's Bill McColl and West wood
j idol Bob Wilkinson, the leading
Coast contenders for Ail-American
wingman recognition.
Many critics have maintained
that McColl is the reason the In
dians are undefeated to date—that
without Big Bill Stanford would be
just another team.
Well, Bill will get an excellent
chance to prove himself tomor
row. Not only will he be facing
comparison with another top end
in Wilkinson; but also, the ab
sence of both Van Alstyne and
Scott will throw an additional
weighty burden on his capable
| shoulders.
McColl's running mate in the
Coliseum will be Wilbur Taylor,
who, though new to the business of
| starting, has picked up a lot of ex
perience in two years with the var
sity. Wilbur is a junior, C ft. 3 in.
tall, and a trackman during the off-
I season.
The only other important lineup
change will be at fullback, where
Bob Meyers will open for the first
time this season. A sophomore who
performed exclusively on defense
for Pasadena JC last year, Meyers
has been developing well on offense
| all season. He's an excellent block
er and a speedy ball - toter and
could be the stopgap in Schwartz's
serious fullback shortage.
Bob Griffin will be on hand to
spell Meyers, along with Chuck Es
segian. Essegian was used on de
fense only last week because of a
back injury, but he'll see some of
fensive duty tomorrow.
Co-captains Russ Pomeroy and
Gordon White will get the usual
call at tackles. Dick Lucas and
Rod Garner are slated to open at
guards, with Manoogian being re
served for part - time defensive
work. Dick Abraham will be at
center.
In the backfield, Gary Kerkorian
will bark the signals; Bob White
and Harry Hugasian will start at
halfbacks; and Boyd Benson will be
on quick call.
The Card squad will bed down
tonight at the Huntington, then
move to the Biltmore tomorrow.
They'll work out this afternoon on
a high school field in Pasadena.

before the season opened as .sure
fire Pasadena material, and to date
nothing has happened either lo
prove or to disprove the crystal
gazers' contentions. San Jose State,
Oregon State, Santa Clara, and USF
were all admittedly teams of no
better than mediocre caliber on the
days they played in the Stadium.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
were not too highly rated on (he
pre - season charts. But they
opened the season by scoring 70
points while blanking Oregon and
Washington State, before drop
ping two tough ones to Washing
ton and Illinois.

The Stanford-UCLA gajne will
he broadcast over a public ad
dress system at Rossotti's Satur
day afternoon for everyone not
making the trek south. A large
scoreboard will be set up to posl
scores, and loudspeakers will be
stationed all over Hie grounds.

The Huskies won out by one
point, while the Illini were handed
their victory on a platter of fum
bles and intercepted passes.
Those two losses, both of the
freak variety, can pretty well be
discounted when figuring the
Bruins' chances tomorrow. Except
for the fact that they have doubt
lessly instilled in the southerner:;
some extra will to win.
The oddsmakers favor Stanford
by seven points. Several develop
ments of the past week have, how
ever, definitely lowered the Indian
stock, prompting Schwartz to state
yesterday that he could not sincere
ly rate his team as better than even
money against its Southland hosts.
Reasons:
1. The loss by injuries of both
Bruce Van Alstyne and bis re
placement at right end. Bob Scot I.
2. The announcement (bat guard
Owen Powell will be shelved for
the third straight week. Powell
suffered an injured ankle against
USF.
.1. The still somewhat shaky
condition of Norm Manooqian.
The sophomore guard, like Pow
ell, hasn't seen action since the
Don contest and has not bad time
to return to top condition.
4. Schwartz's personal cstimn
tion that "UCLA has a very fine
team," after the Card headman
scouted the Bruins' losing battle
against Illinois last Friday night.
In regard to the last item.
Schwartz feels that the Bruins are
"100 per csnt improver! over las'
year, notwithstanding the loss of
Ernie Johnson."
Johnson was the spearhead in la .1
year's Stadium upset in which the
Westwooders, outgained and out
played by the Cards, took advantage
of two Stanford miscues to win
14 to 7.
"Sanders has four very good tail
backs to take Ernie's place,"
Schwartz continued, "and they're
all top-flight passers. And remem
ber that UCLA is leading the con
ference defensively and is second
offensively, ahead of us. That means
a well-balanced team."
Of the four tailbacks mentioned
by Schwartz, it appears likely
that sophomore Johnny Florence
will take first at leading
Sanders' single wing attack.
Southland reports indicate that

Bi»b Moore, usual starter at the
position, will be hampered by in
juries, as well as second-stringtv
Joe Marvin; but they'll probably
see some action.
Moore is the leading passer in
the conference right now.
One very important aspect of the
game from the fans' viewpoint will
be the personal duel between Stan
ford's Bill McColl and West wood
j idol Bob Wilkinson, the leading
Coast contenders for Ail-American
wingman recognition.
Many critics have maintained
that McColl is the reason the In
dians are undefeated to date—that
without Big Bill Stanford would be
just another team.
Well, Bill will get an excellent
chance to prove himself tomor
row. Not only will he be facing
comparison with another top end
in Wilkinson; but also, the ab
sence of both Van Alstyne and
Scott will throw an additional
weighty burden on his capable
| shoulders.
McColl's running mate in the
Coliseum will be Wilbur Taylor,
who, though new to the business of
| starting, has picked up a lot of ex
perience in two years with the var
sity. Wilbur is a junior, C ft. 3 in.
tall, and a trackman during the off-
I season.
The only other important lineup
change will be at fullback, where
Bob Meyers will open for the first
time this season. A sophomore who
performed exclusively on defense
for Pasadena JC last year, Meyers
has been developing well on offense
| all season. He's an excellent block
er and a speedy ball - toter and
could be the stopgap in Schwartz's
serious fullback shortage.
Bob Griffin will be on hand to
spell Meyers, along with Chuck Es
segian. Essegian was used on de
fense only last week because of a
back injury, but he'll see some of
fensive duty tomorrow.
Co-captains Russ Pomeroy and
Gordon White will get the usual
call at tackles. Dick Lucas and
Rod Garner are slated to open at
guards, with Manoogian being re
served for part - time defensive
work. Dick Abraham will be at
center.
In the backfield, Gary Kerkorian
will bark the signals; Bob White
and Harry Hugasian will start at
halfbacks; and Boyd Benson will be
on quick call.
The Card squad will bed down
tonight at the Huntington, then
move to the Biltmore tomorrow.
They'll work out this afternoon on
a high school field in Pasadena.
Departure from Mills Field is
1 scheduled for 12:15 p.m. today.
The chips will be down tomorrow afternoon in the Los Angelor;
Coliseum when Stanford's grid Indians will draw for five of a kind
against Red Sanders' hard-luck UCLA Bruins.
Tomorrow's silver-anniversary contest of the Farm-Westwood
rivalry will mark the first true test of the season for Marchio

Schwartz's four-time winners, and
should go a long way toward an
swering the question uppermost in
the minds of Indian fans. To wit,
do the Indians really hold a Rose
Bowl hand in 1950, or wiil the
Bruins expose it as nothing but ;i
sportswriters' bluff?

making the trek south. A large
scoreboard will be set up to posl
scores, and loudspeakers will be
stationed all over Hie grounds.

The Huskies won out by one
point, while the Illini were handed
their victory on a platter of fum
bles and intercepted passes.
Those two losses, both of the
freak variety, can pretty well be
discounted when figuring the
Bruins' chances tomorrow. Except
for the fact that they have doubt
lessly instilled in the southerner:;
some extra will to win.
The oddsmakers favor Stanford
by seven points. Several develop
ments of the past week have, how
ever, definitely lowered the Indian
stock, prompting Schwartz to state
yesterday that he could not sincere
ly rate his team as better than even
money against its Southland hosts.
Reasons:
1. The loss by injuries of both
Bruce Van Alstyne and bis re
placement at right end. Bob Scot I.
2. The announcement (bat guard
Owen Powell will be shelved for
the third straight week. Powell
suffered an injured ankle against
USF.
.1. The still somewhat shaky
condition of Norm Manooqian.
The sophomore guard, like Pow
ell, hasn't seen action since the
Don contest and has not bad time
to return to top condition.
4. Schwartz's personal cstimn
tion that "UCLA has a very fine
team," after the Card headman
scouted the Bruins' losing battle
against Illinois last Friday night.
In regard to the last item.
Schwartz feels that the Bruins are
"100 per csnt improver! over las'
year, notwithstanding the loss of
Ernie Johnson."
Johnson was the spearhead in la .1
year's Stadium upset in which the
Westwooders, outgained and out
played by the Cards, took advantage
of two Stanford miscues to win
14 to 7.
"Sanders has four very good tail
backs to take Ernie's place,"
Schwartz continued, "and they're
all top-flight passers. And remem
ber that UCLA is leading the con
ference defensively and is second
offensively, ahead of us. That means
a well-balanced team."
Of the four tailbacks mentioned
by Schwartz, it appears likely
that sophomore Johnny Florence
will take first at leading
Sanders' single wing attack.
Southland reports indicate that

Bi»b Moore, usual starter at the
position, will be hampered by in
juries, as well as second-stringtv
Joe Marvin; but they'll probably
see some action.
Moore is the leading passer in
the conference right now.
One very important aspect of the
game from the fans' viewpoint will
be the personal duel between Stan
ford's Bill McColl and West wood
j idol Bob Wilkinson, the leading
Coast contenders for Ail-American
wingman recognition.
Many critics have maintained
that McColl is the reason the In
dians are undefeated to date—that
without Big Bill Stanford would be
just another team.
Well, Bill will get an excellent
chance to prove himself tomor
row. Not only will he be facing
comparison with another top end
in Wilkinson; but also, the ab
sence of both Van Alstyne and
Scott will throw an additional
weighty burden on his capable
| shoulders.
McColl's running mate in the
Coliseum will be Wilbur Taylor,
who, though new to the business of
| starting, has picked up a lot of ex
perience in two years with the var
sity. Wilbur is a junior, C ft. 3 in.
tall, and a trackman during the off-
I season.
The only other important lineup
change will be at fullback, where
Bob Meyers will open for the first
time this season. A sophomore who
performed exclusively on defense
for Pasadena JC last year, Meyers
has been developing well on offense
| all season. He's an excellent block
er and a speedy ball - toter and
could be the stopgap in Schwartz's
serious fullback shortage.
Bob Griffin will be on hand to
spell Meyers, along with Chuck Es
segian. Essegian was used on de
fense only last week because of a
back injury, but he'll see some of
fensive duty tomorrow.
Co-captains Russ Pomeroy and
Gordon White will get the usual
call at tackles. Dick Lucas and
Rod Garner are slated to open at
guards, with Manoogian being re
served for part - time defensive
work. Dick Abraham will be at
center.
In the backfield, Gary Kerkorian
will bark the signals; Bob White
and Harry Hugasian will start at
halfbacks; and Boyd Benson will be
on quick call.
The Card squad will bed down
tonight at the Huntington, then
move to the Biltmore tomorrow.
They'll work out this afternoon on
a high school field in Pasadena.
Departure from Mills Field is
1 scheduled for 12:15 p.m. today.
The chips will be down tomorrow afternoon in the Los Angelor;
Coliseum when Stanford's grid Indians will draw for five of a kind
against Red Sanders' hard-luck UCLA Bruins.
Tomorrow's silver-anniversary contest of the Farm-Westwood
rivalry will mark the first true test of the season for Marchio

Schwartz's four-time winners, and
should go a long way toward an
swering the question uppermost in
the minds of Indian fans. To wit,
do the Indians really hold a Rose
Bowl hand in 1950, or wiil the
Bruins expose it as nothing but ;i
sportswriters' bluff?
The Cardinals were tabbed lonr*
before the season opened as .sure
fire Pasadena material, and to date
nothing has happened either lo
prove or to disprove the crystal
gazers' contentions. San Jose State,
Oregon State, Santa Clara, and USF
were all admittedly teams of no
better than mediocre caliber on the
days they played in the Stadium.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
were not too highly rated on (he
pre - season charts. But they
opened the season by scoring 70
points while blanking Oregon and
Washington State, before drop
ping two tough ones to Washing
ton and Illinois.
