# Big Red After Big Bad Bruin
## UCLA Is Toughest Foe Yet; Game May Answer Rose Bowl Questions 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The chips will be down tomorrow afternoon in the Los Angelor;
Coliseum when Stanford's grid Indians will draw for five of a kind
against Red Sanders' hard-luck UCLA Bruins.
Tomorrow's silver-anniversary contest of the Farm-Westwood
rivalry will mark the first true test of the season for Marchio

Schwartz's four-time winners, and
should go a long way toward an
swering the question uppermost in
the minds of Indian fans. To wit,
do the Indians really hold a Rose
Bowl hand in 1950, or wiil the
Bruins expose it as nothing but ;i
sportswriters' bluff?
The Cardinals were tabbed lonr*
before the season opened as .sure
fire Pasadena material, and to date
nothing has happened either lo
prove or to disprove the crystal
gazers' contentions. San Jose State,
Oregon State, Santa Clara, and USF
were all admittedly teams of no
better than mediocre caliber on the
days they played in the Stadium.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
were not too highly rated on (he
pre - season charts. But they
opened the season by scoring 70
points while blanking Oregon and
Washington State, before drop
ping two tough ones to Washing
ton and Illinois.

The Stanford-UCLA gajne will
he broadcast over a public ad
dress system at Rossotti's Satur
day afternoon for everyone not
making the trek south. A large
scoreboard will be set up to posl
scores, and loudspeakers will be
stationed all over Hie grounds.

The Huskies won out by one
point, while the Illini were handed
their victory on a platter of fum
bles and intercepted passes.
Those two losses, both of the
freak variety, can pretty well be
discounted when figuring the
Bruins' chances tomorrow. Except
for the fact that they have doubt
lessly instilled in the southerner:;
some extra will to win.
The oddsmakers favor Stanford
by seven points. Several develop
ments of the past week have, how
ever, definitely lowered the Indian
stock, prompting Schwartz to state
yesterday that he could not sincere
ly rate his team as better than even
money against its Southland hosts.
Reasons:
1. The loss by injuries of both
Bruce Van Alstyne and bis re
placement at right end. Bob Scot I.
2. The announcement (bat guard
Owen Powell will be shelved for
the third straight week. Powell
suffered an injured ankle against
USF.
.1. The still somewhat shaky
condition of Norm Manooqian.
The sophomore guard, like Pow
ell, hasn't seen action since the
Don contest and has not bad time
to return to top condition.
4. Schwartz's personal cstimn
tion that "UCLA has a very fine
team," after the Card headman
scouted the Bruins' losing battle
against Illinois last Friday night.
In regard to the last item.
Schwartz feels that the Bruins are
"100 per csnt improver! over las'
year, notwithstanding the loss of
Ernie Johnson."
Johnson was the spearhead in la .1
