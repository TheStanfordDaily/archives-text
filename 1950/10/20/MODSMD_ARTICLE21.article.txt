# YMCA Enters the Picture
## 
### 
Plans started taking form last night for the
definite organization of a YMCA on campus.
With these plans comes a potentially great ad
dition to the religious, recreational, and social
life of every Stanford man.
The "Y" last had a place on the Farm before
the first World War. However interest propped,
and the group was disbanded as more and more
men left college.
After several guarters at the drawing board,
the men who have been making plans for a re
turn of the "Y" are now ready to put the pro
gram into operation.
The "Y" program is familiar to nearly every
one. Many freshmen have started in at Stan
ford with a background of Hi-Y work in their
respective high schools.
However, at Stanford they found a blank
space between completely religious organiza
tions and regular social life. The women had
their group, the men did not.
With the reinstitution of the "Y," that facet of
a college man's life can be filled.
The name YMCA has several aspects which
must be recognized by the group if it is to suc

ceed and be of service to Stanford. The first
function and by far the most important if any
group is going to justify its existence—is serv
ice.
Service through the YMCA can come from
various channels. Student-faculty discussions,
weekend work projects, social and relief work
—all have their place in the program.
As indicated by its name, the YMCA has a
religious purpose. This must be clarified in the
minds of many men before they will accept the
organization.
The "Y," as planned by the student commit
tee, will not be connected with the Memorial
Church or with the Church Committee. It aims
toward a practical application of religious prin
ciples in student affairs.
The religious phase of the YMCA program is
concentrated not on religion as such, but rather
on the development of a philosophy of life by
its members.
With the right kind of backing, the men's
"Y" will become an important link in the lives
of many who are not yet anchored on solid
ground.
