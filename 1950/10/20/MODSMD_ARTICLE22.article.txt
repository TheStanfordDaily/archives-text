# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
I went to hear Professor Toynbee yesterday and it
was quite an experience. Before I explain what he
;:aid, ltl me compliment the Stanford student body on
their attendance ... a fitting tribute to this great

scholar who has contributed so
much to the field of human knowl
edge. Previously, of course, he
has gained greatest distinction
with his "Study of History," but
his visit to Stanford qualifies him
a? a true immortal—it's the only
time since the great earthquake
that the Administration has dis
missed classes.

1 took one look at the hordes pouring down from
the Quad after their 10 o'clocks and ran for a bucket
... I thought it was an all-University fire drill. By
10:30 every seat in the house as well as every square
loot of standing room was filled. I understand Pro
f< ::sor Toynbee noticed how the joint was packed and
almost changed his subject to "The Decline and Fall
ol the Mem Aud." It was the greatest Stanford turn
out since they showed "Ecstasy" at the Sunday night
Hick.
Being a scholar of some note myself (I got my last
paper back with the comment ". . . this is a hell of
a note"), I was especially interested in his remarks
on the appearance of cyclical trends in all aspects of
history—no wonder Schwinn has made such a fortune
in the bicycle business. Seriously though, this prin
ciple of recurring cycles has great utility outside the
realm of historical abstraction ... in fact, I've spent
most ol my time since the lecture applying it to my
racing iorm. I'm not the only one, though. Rumor has

it that the Professor's real objective in visiting this
area was the Bay Meadows meeting.
One thing about affairs of this kind that never fails
to upset me, however, is the sheer and obvious hypoc
risy of half the women in the audience—the knitters.
Now any psychologist will tell you that it is utterly
impossible to perform an operation that depends not
only on digital dexterity but on mathematical pre
ciseness as well and listen with any degree of com
prehension to a lecture at the same time. But doggone
if they don't sit there with their hands going a mile
a minute, manipulating three needles and 14 rolls of
yarn, and look like they not only understand every
thing that's being said, but probably could improve on
at least half of it.
The reason it bothers me so much is that knitting
itself fascinates me. I didn't master the art of tying
my shoelaces till I was 17, and so when I spot one of
these human looms I can't keep my eyes oft' their
woik. I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't have to
copy their lecture notes afterwards every time. But
yesterday was particularly disastrous because I had a
l'umbltfinger sitting next to me, and when that hap
pens even a Yogi couldn't concentrate. . . . "knit . . .
click . . . knit . . . damn! knit . . . click . . . knit
click . . . damn!" Now I ask you, with that chorus
in your ears, could you tell whatinell Professor Toyn
bee had to say about Stanford's chance for the Rose
Bowl?
THOUGHT FOR BIG GAME NIGHT
A man without a woman is like a ship without a sail,
is like a horse without his hay . . .
But if there's one thing worse in this universe—
it's a gal who won't pay her own way.
