To the Editor:
Reverend Small of Sun Jose was a guest speaker
la.st '1 ue.sday night at a meeting of the Stanford Inter
val :.ity Christian Fellowship, where he delivered a
talk on the degenerate state of affairs in the Arab East
in general and Egypt in particular, and the glorious
return of the Israelis, exactly as prophesied in the Old
Testament.
1. In his sincere effort to prove the infallibility of
the Prophecies (which it is his right to believe in), he
: lipped into unjustified generalizations and dramatic
ally reached for examples from present Egyptian life
that in many cases, couldn't fit until altered.
2. liy so doing, he immersed himself into ticklish
political questions about which he obviously was not
well informed.
His "unkind" reference to Islam is alien to a true

and tolerant Christian faith. Many American mis
sionaries and educators in the Arab East would un
hesitatingly condemn such an attitude.
4. The devastating implication, as if with a feeling
of a just settlement, that the peasants of Egypt are
wretched, diseased, and starved because they are the
descendants of their cursed ancestors, is not only un
true, hut unChristian and undemocratic.
Equally undemocratic (to use a very mild word), is
the implication that justifies foreign domination of
the Arab East on the ground of Scriptural Prophecies.
5. Finally, in his sincere effort to uphold the Old
Testament and demonstrate its up-to-dateness, Rev
erend Small has imparted a body of misinformation to
some hundred innocent Stanford students, most of
whom have no access to Near Eastern affairs through
any other channels.
