# Williams Leads Bruins; Wilkinson vs. McColl
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Let's meet the Bruins.
Coach Red Sanders has some pretty rugged gridders hiding under those
pale blue uniforms. If past performances hold up and if LA scribes prove
right for a change, Stanford rooters will be remembering the names of
Wilkinson, Williams, Marvin, Moore, Hansen, and MacLachlan.

These are the gridders who figure
to give the Indians the most trouble
tomorrow in the Coliseum. They are
the ones who must produce if Coach
Sanders is to get his men back on
the victory road.
Wilkinson. Ail-American?
According to pre-season forecasts
and the UCLA prospectus, Bob Wil
kinson, a two-year letterman end,
was West's real hope for national
honors. So far, Bob, who set eight
records last year, has failed to play
up to expectations. He will be out for
a good performance tomorrow, and
hopes to show Bill McColl how a
flankman performs. Is he kidding?
Top offensive weapon the Bruins
have mustered so far is burly Dave
Williams. A pile-driving fullback,
Williams has been able to tear oft
yardage through the middle most all
the time. The Indians must be right
if they plan to bottle him up.
Joe Marvin and Bob Moore have
been fighting out for the key tailback
spot. Both are on the Westwood in
jury list. Card circles feel that this
is just some rumor talk. Marvin has
another year of eligibility and looks
like an eventual replacement for
Ernie Johnson. Moore is a Compton
JC transfer, big, fast, and rugged.
If both are hampered by in
juries, either Johnny Florence or
Ted Narleski could step in. Flor
ence returns to the Westwood cam
pus after a three-year absence.
Narleski is up from the frosh, and
is a nifty passer.
Hansen Is Consistent
Howie Hansen is playing his third
year of Varsity ball. Last year he
led all Bruins in minutes played
(342 in nine games). He carried the
ball 59 times for 321 yards and 5.45
average. He scored one touchdown.
Hansen is capably backed up by Ike
Jones, a former battery mate of Dick
Horn at Santa Monica High.
Bruce MacLachlan, a 5 ft. 10 in.

senior guard with two numerals, is
the mainstay of the UCLA line. I
Bruce is fast, aggressive, and smart.
In the '49 campaign, Bruce got plenty
of play for All-Coast honors. The
same will go for this season, too.
Other solid linemen are Donn
Moomaw, who moved from end to
center for this year; Breck Stro
schein, at both offensive and defen
sive right tackle; and Bob Watson, |
made-over end.
