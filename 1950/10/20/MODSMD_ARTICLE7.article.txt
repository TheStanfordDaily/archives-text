# Toynbee To Discuss Future Tonight; Says Orient, Africa Control Conflict
## Korea Holds Future's Key 
### DIANE JESSEN 
The Orientals and Africans
will ultimately decide the con
flict between Russia and the
United States.
Arnold J. Toynbee, consid
ered one of the foremost histo
rians of the twentieth century,
expressed this opinion at a press
conference just before he spoke
to Stanford faculty and students
yesterday in Memorial Audito
rium.
'"The Orientals and Africans will
have the last word. The important
thing is," he warned, "how will they
react?"
Professor Toynbee said that as we
fight in Korea today we must real
ize that the government we set up
there will be a large factor in deter
mining how the Orientals and Afri
cans will feel toward the Western
countries. These two large masses
cf peoples have a choice between
Communism or Western philoso
phies, and the side they choose will
decide which is to predominate.
Allowing self-rule, he feels, is
the best weapon the Western
countries have against the ad
vance of Communism. Lashing
out against any other choice. Pro
fessor Toynbee said, "I feel cer
tain that a puppet .government
cannot he kept in any country
now. I can't believe that's what
we're fighting for."
Citing Indo-China as an example,
he said that here the people had
only two choices offered to them—
French rule or Communism. He in
ferred that this situation could have
been prevented if Indo-China had
been allowed to have its own gov
ernment.
"I feel sure that if Britain had
not given India its independence,
we would have the same situation
there today," he said.
"We arc now farther from
World War 111 than ever before,"
he maintains. He sees in each
Western victory of the cold war—
first the Berlin airlift, then the
Greek civil war, and finally the
Korean struggle—events that put
the time of a major conflict far
ther and farther away. In his
opinion, the Korean war will re
main localized, as will possible
conflicts in Europe for some time
to come, before we will the
conflagration of another World
War.
Professor Toynbee considers cur
rent history as a light illuminating
ways of interpreting past history.
As a historian ho is noted for his
sweeping survey of the patterns of
21 different civilizations, and his
method of combining religion and
history into one. He is presently
working on his ninth volume of "A
Study of Historv," which is rated by
the London "Nation" as belonging
in the same class with Gibbon's
"Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire" and Spenglcr's "Decline of
the West."
"The West must not push China
into the arms of Russia." Profcs

sor Toynbee emphasized. He be
lieves we should uphold the re
mains of the Formosan govern
ment as a possible open door for
the return of Chiang Kai-shek,
or some other representative of a
genuine Chinese government.
The real issue between Commu
nism and the West is not material
but spiritual, Professor Toynbec
believes. He points out that the
economic scale of capitalism, so
cialism, and Communism is one of
gradation. He ventured to add with
a broad smile that "even in Rus
sia a man might be able to consider
his toothbrush his own."
'"The real issue is how we feel
about the human soul," he said.
"The struggle between Commu
nism and the West is essentially
that of the Christian concept of
the value of the soul and that of
the Communist substitute for re
ligion— a worship of the martyr,
the collective group, state 'wel
fare' as they see it.
"The real question for us is to
know just what our religion is. This
is the biggest question Russia raises
for us."
Asked about Russia's future ex
pansion, he said we could expect
her to assimilate countries on her
far eastern fringe and in the Cau
casus area. These more backward
countries look to Russia for their
culture. He does not feel, however,
that Russia will be able to marshal
such countries as Czechoslovakia,
Turkey, and others, which have
well-defined cultures of their own.
The United Nations can be an
effective agency only as it fur
nishes the constitutional forum
for dealing with Russia, Professor
Toynbec believes. For this rea
son. he hopes that Russia will re
main in the UN. If Russia will
not co-opcrate in the UN, then
the UN's principal use will he in
providing a framework within
which the Western powers can
build up a close alliance.
When the skies have cleared and
the paramount issues between Rus
sia and the Western countries have
been decided, Professor Toynbec
believes history will find two re
sults that the challenge of Commu
nism to the West brought forth:
1. A quickening of the establish
ment of some sort of world govern
ment.
2. A sharing of the "good things
of the world" with the less fortu
nate peoples, including Orientals
and Africans. This will, he con
cludes, be a bond of common human
effort for the betterment of ali.

son. he hopes that Russia will re

not co-opcrate in the UN, then
the UN's principal use will he in
providing a framework within
which the Western powers can

When the skies have cleared and
the paramount issues between Rus
sia and the Western countries have
been decided, Professor Toynbec
believes history will find two re
sults that the challenge of Commu
nism to the West brought forth:
1. A quickening of the establish
ment of some sort of world govern
ment.
2. A sharing of the "good things
of the world" with the less fortu
nate peoples, including Orientals
and Africans. This will, he con
cludes, be a bond of common human
effort for the betterment of ali.
The Orientals and Africans
will ultimately decide the con
flict between Russia and the
United States.
Arnold J. Toynbee, consid
ered one of the foremost histo
rians of the twentieth century,
expressed this opinion at a press
conference just before he spoke
to Stanford faculty and students
yesterday in Memorial Audito
rium.
'"The Orientals and Africans will
have the last word. The important
thing is," he warned, "how will they
react?"
Professor Toynbee said that as we
fight in Korea today we must real
ize that the government we set up
there will be a large factor in deter
mining how the Orientals and Afri
cans will feel toward the Western
countries. These two large masses
cf peoples have a choice between
Communism or Western philoso
phies, and the side they choose will
decide which is to predominate.
Allowing self-rule, he feels, is
the best weapon the Western
countries have against the ad
vance of Communism. Lashing
out against any other choice. Pro
fessor Toynbee said, "I feel cer
tain that a puppet .government
cannot he kept in any country
now. I can't believe that's what
we're fighting for."
Citing Indo-China as an example,
he said that here the people had
only two choices offered to them—
French rule or Communism. He in
ferred that this situation could have
been prevented if Indo-China had
been allowed to have its own gov
ernment.
"I feel sure that if Britain had
not given India its independence,
we would have the same situation
there today," he said.
"We arc now farther from
World War 111 than ever before,"
he maintains. He sees in each
Western victory of the cold war—
first the Berlin airlift, then the
Greek civil war, and finally the
Korean struggle—events that put
the time of a major conflict far
ther and farther away. In his
opinion, the Korean war will re
main localized, as will possible
conflicts in Europe for some time
to come, before we will the
conflagration of another World
War.
Professor Toynbee considers cur
rent history as a light illuminating
ways of interpreting past history.
As a historian ho is noted for his
sweeping survey of the patterns of
21 different civilizations, and his
method of combining religion and
history into one. He is presently
working on his ninth volume of "A
Study of Historv," which is rated by
the London "Nation" as belonging
in the same class with Gibbon's
"Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire" and Spenglcr's "Decline of
the West."

lieves we should uphold the re
mains of the Formosan govern
ment as a possible open door for
the return of Chiang Kai-shek,
or some other representative of a
genuine Chinese government.
The real issue between Commu
nism and the West is not material
but spiritual, Professor Toynbec
believes. He points out that the
economic scale of capitalism, so
cialism, and Communism is one of
gradation. He ventured to add with
a broad smile that "even in Rus
sia a man might be able to consider
his toothbrush his own."
'"The real issue is how we feel
about the human soul," he said.
"The struggle between Commu
nism and the West is essentially
that of the Christian concept of
the value of the soul and that of
the Communist substitute for re
ligion— a worship of the martyr,
the collective group, state 'wel
fare' as they see it.
"The real question for us is to
know just what our religion is. This
is the biggest question Russia raises
for us."
Asked about Russia's future ex
pansion, he said we could expect
her to assimilate countries on her
far eastern fringe and in the Cau
casus area. These more backward
countries look to Russia for their
culture. He does not feel, however,
that Russia will be able to marshal
such countries as Czechoslovakia,
Turkey, and others, which have
well-defined cultures of their own.

Allowing self-rule, he feels, is
the best weapon the Western
countries have against the ad
vance of Communism. Lashing
out against any other choice. Pro
fessor Toynbee said, "I feel cer
tain that a puppet .government
cannot he kept in any country
now. I can't believe that's what
we're fighting for."
Citing Indo-China as an example,
he said that here the people had
only two choices offered to them—
French rule or Communism. He in
ferred that this situation could have
been prevented if Indo-China had
been allowed to have its own gov
ernment.
"I feel sure that if Britain had
not given India its independence,
we would have the same situation
there today," he said.
"We arc now farther from
World War 111 than ever before,"
he maintains. He sees in each
Western victory of the cold war—
first the Berlin airlift, then the
Greek civil war, and finally the
Korean struggle—events that put
the time of a major conflict far
ther and farther away. In his
opinion, the Korean war will re
main localized, as will possible
conflicts in Europe for some time
to come, before we will the
conflagration of another World
War.
Professor Toynbee considers cur

sweeping survey of the patterns of
21 different civilizations, and his
method of combining religion and
history into one. He is presently
working on his ninth volume of "A

the London "Nation" as belonging
in the same class with Gibbon's
"Decline and Fall of the Roman

sor Toynbee emphasized. He be
lieves we should uphold the re
mains of the Formosan govern
ment as a possible open door for
the return of Chiang Kai-shek,
or some other representative of a
genuine Chinese government.
The real issue between Commu
nism and the West is not material
but spiritual, Professor Toynbec
believes. He points out that the
economic scale of capitalism, so
cialism, and Communism is one of
gradation. He ventured to add with
a broad smile that "even in Rus
sia a man might be able to consider
his toothbrush his own."
'"The real issue is how we feel
about the human soul," he said.
"The struggle between Commu
nism and the West is essentially
that of the Christian concept of
the value of the soul and that of
the Communist substitute for re
ligion— a worship of the martyr,
the collective group, state 'wel
fare' as they see it.
"The real question for us is to
know just what our religion is. This
is the biggest question Russia raises
for us."
Asked about Russia's future ex
pansion, he said we could expect
her to assimilate countries on her
far eastern fringe and in the Cau
casus area. These more backward
countries look to Russia for their
culture. He does not feel, however,
that Russia will be able to marshal
such countries as Czechoslovakia,
Turkey, and others, which have
well-defined cultures of their own.
The United Nations can be an
effective agency only as it fur
nishes the constitutional forum
for dealing with Russia, Professor
Toynbec believes. For this rea
son. he hopes that Russia will re
main in the UN. If Russia will
not co-opcrate in the UN, then
the UN's principal use will he in
providing a framework within
which the Western powers can
build up a close alliance.
When the skies have cleared and
the paramount issues between Rus
sia and the Western countries have
been decided, Professor Toynbec
believes history will find two re
sults that the challenge of Commu
nism to the West brought forth:
1. A quickening of the establish
ment of some sort of world govern
ment.
2. A sharing of the "good things
of the world" with the less fortu
nate peoples, including Orientals
and Africans. This will, he con

effort for the betterment of ali.

The Orientals and Africans
will ultimately decide the con
flict between Russia and the
United States.
Arnold J. Toynbee, consid
ered one of the foremost histo
rians of the twentieth century,
expressed this opinion at a press
conference just before he spoke
to Stanford faculty and students
yesterday in Memorial Audito
rium.
'"The Orientals and Africans will
have the last word. The important
thing is," he warned, "how will they
react?"
Professor Toynbee said that as we
fight in Korea today we must real
ize that the government we set up
there will be a large factor in deter
mining how the Orientals and Afri
cans will feel toward the Western
countries. These two large masses
cf peoples have a choice between
Communism or Western philoso
phies, and the side they choose will
decide which is to predominate.
