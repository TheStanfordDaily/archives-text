# Toynbee To Discuss Future Tonight; Says Orient, Africa Control Conflict
## Korea Holds Future's Key 
### DIANE JESSEN 
The Orientals and Africans
will ultimately decide the con
flict between Russia and the
United States.
Arnold J. Toynbee, consid
ered one of the foremost histo
rians of the twentieth century,
expressed this opinion at a press
conference just before he spoke
to Stanford faculty and students
yesterday in Memorial Audito
rium.
'"The Orientals and Africans will
have the last word. The important
thing is," he warned, "how will they
react?"
Professor Toynbee said that as we
fight in Korea today we must real
ize that the government we set up
there will be a large factor in deter
mining how the Orientals and Afri
cans will feel toward the Western
countries. These two large masses
cf peoples have a choice between
Communism or Western philoso
phies, and the side they choose will
decide which is to predominate.
Allowing self-rule, he feels, is
the best weapon the Western
countries have against the ad
vance of Communism. Lashing
out against any other choice. Pro
fessor Toynbee said, "I feel cer
tain that a puppet .government
cannot he kept in any country
now. I can't believe that's what
we're fighting for."
Citing Indo-China as an example,
he said that here the people had
only two choices offered to them—
French rule or Communism. He in
ferred that this situation could have
been prevented if Indo-China had
been allowed to have its own gov
ernment.
"I feel sure that if Britain had
not given India its independence,
we would have the same situation
there today," he said.
"We arc now farther from
World War 111 than ever before,"
he maintains. He sees in each
Western victory of the cold war—
first the Berlin airlift, then the
Greek civil war, and finally the
Korean struggle—events that put
the time of a major conflict far
ther and farther away. In his
opinion, the Korean war will re
main localized, as will possible
conflicts in Europe for some time
to come, before we will the
conflagration of another World
War.
Professor Toynbee considers cur
rent history as a light illuminating
ways of interpreting past history.
As a historian ho is noted for his
sweeping survey of the patterns of
21 different civilizations, and his
method of combining religion and
history into one. He is presently
working on his ninth volume of "A
Study of Historv," which is rated by
the London "Nation" as belonging
in the same class with Gibbon's
"Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire" and Spenglcr's "Decline of
the West."
"The West must not push China
into the arms of Russia." Profcs
