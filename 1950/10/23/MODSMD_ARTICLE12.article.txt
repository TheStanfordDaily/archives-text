TOKYO, Monday, Oct. 23 (UP)—
American airmen reported today
that South Korean troops have
passed Huichon in their race north
and arc driving on Kanggye, 20
miles south of the Manchurian bor
der.
The South Korean advance is
bearing down on Kanggye so fast
that the Reds are fleeing the city
toward the frontier 20 miles north,
a reconnaissance pilot reported.
Flights of B-26 light bombers were
ordered to attack the Reds.
Communist troops cut off behind

the swift - moving United Nations
spearheads were surrendering in
droves, with some even waving
white surrender flags at airlift
planes ferrying in supplies for
American paratroopers.
While the South Koreans drove
for Kanggye, the U.S. 24th Division
and British troops were heading for
Sinanju, a key rail and highway
junction 39 miles north of Pyong
yang. The Americans are rushing
to save 150 Gl's on a stalled train
in a tunnel north of Pyongyang.


ONLY MOP-UP REMAlNS—Americans driving north of Pyong
yang have linked up with paratroopers who dropped on Sun
chon and Sukchon (parachute symbols) to trap North Koreans
fleeing from their capital. Rescue columns were sent after U.S.
prisoners still being held in rail tunnel (X) 40 miles north of
Pyongyang. Yanks at Sunchon joined ROK forces who speared
west from Wonsan (1) area in race for Manchurian border only
85 miles away. North of Wonsan, ROK forces took Hongwon (2)
and were only 90 miles from Manchurian border. Only the
mop-up remained as some 36,000 panicky Reds fled north across
Korea toward the frontier. —Acme telephoto
