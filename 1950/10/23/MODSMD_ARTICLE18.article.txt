# Vandals Set 'C' Afire On Farm Grass
## 
### 
Big Game rivalry flared up mo
! mentarily on the Stanford campus
yesterday for the first time this
quarter.
At 3 p.m., a group of six assailants
' —believed to be Cal students—
burned a 10-foot "C" in the grass
at the Stanford end of Palm Drive.
At the same time, a carload of
j three Stanford women spotted two
| of the arsonists scramble up the
I bank from the burning "C," jump
! into a car, and speed off down Palm
Drive toward Palo Alto.
The trio gave chase, but lost the
escapees, "who were going at least
| 40 miles an hour," when the latter
i disregarded the stop sign at the
| end of the Drive and turned north
on El Camino Real.
The coeds — Nancy Norton, Lpe
| Calhoun, and Marydee Tinley, all
of Lagunita Court—said there were
three boys and one girl waiting in
the parked car while their two co
horts engaged in engraving the big
"C."
They said the occupants '"looked
; more like college students than high
! school pranksters."
The license number of the escap
ing car, they reported, was 2985799.
Miss Norton said the auto was a
'49 Chevrolet sedan of a "Grecian
gray" color.
A check with the State Depart
' ment of Motor Vehicles in Sacra
mento by Stanford police revealed
no record of such a license number
| to date.
Cal police officials told The Daily
they could not immediately identify
ownership of ( the car—but would
"keep on the looltout for it."
Another big "C," similar to the
one burned yesterday, was set into
; the same patch of lawn last year
during the weeks preceding the Big
Game.
