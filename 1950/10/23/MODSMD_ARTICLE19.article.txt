# Veteran Mailer Given a Party
## 
### 
A man who has a sharp memory
for details but a bad one for years
got a big surprise at Stanford last
week.
He is Jack Goesle, supervisor of
mailing in the University's records
bureau — the man who mails out
football applications, the Alumni
Review, Stanford Today, and anv
other mailing on the University's
addressograph plates.
He had forgotten what others re
membered—that this was his 25th
year at Stanford.
So Thursday evening some 4ft of
his friends, header! bv Dean of Stu
dents Donald Winbieler, met at Ra
mor Oaks to give a surprise party
for Goesle, who was lured to the
party under elaborate pretenses.
Goesle was presented with a
portable radio as a token of thanks
from all his friends for his long
service to Stanford.
Goesle worked for the Alumni
Association from 1925 until 1914.
when the University took over op
oration of the records bureau.
