# For a Stronger UN...

### 
With the Korean situation adding to the im
portance and the strength of the United Nations,
observance of United Nations Week takes on
greater significance than ever for Stanford stu
dents who face the very strong possibility of
joining UN troops in Korea.
Just five years ago, representatives of 59 na
tions gathered at Lake Success to sign the
United Nations Charter to bring to life the or
ganization which is now being given the su
preme test on the Korean battlefront.
The strength of the UN has been shown in
its decisive action against the North Korean at
tack. Whether or not the five-year-old UN will
continue to grow in strength will be dependent
on the final political outcome of the Korean
war.
The machinery of the United Nations is not
yet perfected, but its strength lies in the fact
(hat it can grow and change to meet the require
ments of gaining and maintaining world peace.
Perhaps the greatest impasse in UN action has

been the use of the "Veto Power" in the Se
curity Council. If the proposals to overcome
the effect of the veto are adopted, the UN will
be materially strengthened as a democratic or
ganization to cope with problems of interna
tional importance.
In the fields of economic and social aid, the
United Nations has progressed a long way
since its beginning. The many auionomous
agencies under the Economic and Social Coun
cil have agricultural, economic, and material
aid to needy peoples throughout the world.
Official commemoration of United Nations
Day will take place throughout the United
States tomorrow and the carillon will ring out
with the United Nations Hymn, reminding us
all that it is our responsibility to back the United
Nations in bringing peace to the world.
The United Nations is meeting a supreme test
on its fifth anniversary. Through intelligent
and open-minded interest, v/e may be in a posi
tion to celebrate future anniversaries of the UN
in a peaceful world. M.M.
