of Roble. The trio bought the an
cient auto in Berkeley last summer

Hobart has a reputation for being
perennially A group of Cal
students stole the car before its own
ers could get it out of Berkeley. Then
again the other night it disappeared.
Whin the Roble girls left the hall in

the morning, they found the vener
able sedan blocking their path.
"Hobart has several features which
keep the people who take him from
getting very far," Thorpe explained.
But the car is in good shape, he added.
"The motor runs like a top."
Hobart's exterior features smooth,
frictionless tires, and a recessed crank
case. The windshield rolls up—mak
ing it partially convertible, Thorpe
said. Inside, the sedan is upholstered
in green plush. A small patch of
fungus grows along the side.
The three owners chose the name
"Hobart" because "it conveys a feel
ing of decayed elegance."—Dorothy
