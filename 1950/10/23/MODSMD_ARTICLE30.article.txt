# CHAMBER MUSIC
## Ratner's Work Praised 
### 
The first of a series of chamber
music recitals was presented yes
terday afternoon by the Stanford
Music Department under the di
rection of Sandor Salgo, assisted by
Putnam Aldrich.
The program opened witli Johann
Rosenmuller's setting of Psalm 134
for Contralto, Strings and Harpsi
chord, followed by a first perform
once of Leonard Ratner's Diver
tissement for Oboe, Horn, and Bas
soon. Mozart's Quintet for Clari
net and Strings, in A Major, K. 581
concluded the offering.
The outstanding work of the re
cital, in content and performance,
was Ratner's delightful Divertisse
ment. Composing for a difficult
combination of instruments, Mr.
Ratner contrived to blend them ex
cellently, keeping the ensemble at
all times balanced. In the five brief
movements, the composer succeed
ed in bringing out the intended
quality of each instrument, but re
tained the integration of a chamber
group.
The work is a refreshing addi
tion to the repertoire, and should
be repeated often in the future.
In keeping with the standard of

the composition, the performance
by Bruce Allen, bassoon; Irving |
Crawford, horn; and George Houle, !
oboe, was excellent. Houle, with !
his usual flawless technique, car
ried the work's melody,with clarity j
and tone.
The Rosenmuller work was al
most entirely a piece for contralto
and harpsichord, the strings having ,
little to do. Rather elementary in
construction, the work was repeti
tious and monotonous. Aside from
historical interest, it added little to !
the program except for the oppor
tunity of hearing, at Stanford, the
harpsichord, which was well played !
by Putnam Aldrich.
The Mozart Quintet was per
formed with competence, but the
performers were handicapped by !
the work itself, which is not as in
teresting or varied, from an audi- J
ence's standpoint, as most other
Mozart chamber works.
The musicianship throughout, was !
noteworthy, indicating that the
next recital, Nov. 5, should be of
even greater interest, when the per- \
formers will not have the burden i
of such works as the Rosenmuller
and the Mozart Quintet of yester
day's program.â€”Norman McKown
