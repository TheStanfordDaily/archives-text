# National Champs Have Too Much Sock for Cards
## 
### 
An improving Stanford soccer
team lost its second game in a week
Saturday morning to national
champion USF 5 to 0. The score be
lies the battle as it was a hard fight
all the 1 way with the aggressive
Dons leading only 1 to 0 at the
half.
In the final quarter Stanford was
finally able to start somewhat of an
offensive of its own. With Louie
Lane, who had been transferred
to center forward from his usual
center halfback position, Jeff Mors
head, and Ildvilio leading the at
tack, the Indians were finally able
to puncture USF's defense late in
the period with a goal by Havilio.
The counter was called back,
however, when the referee spotted
a twelfth and extra Cardinal on the
field. Jim Sacerdote, who had been
substituted for, was not able to get
off the field before the play oc
curred.
Previously, on last Wednesday
evening, the Indians lost a heart
breaker to San Francisco City Col
lege 3 to 2.
