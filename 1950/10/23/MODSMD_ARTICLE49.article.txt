## JV's Pressed In 15-14 Win Over Cal Poly 
### 
Stanford's Braves, pressed for the
first time this season, squeezed to a
15 to 14 win over a strong California
Poly team Saturday night at San
Luis Obispo.
Cal Poly scored first in the open
ing period when a Brave aerial was
picked off and run back for a
touchdown.
The JV's bounced back quickly,
scoring on a 15-yard pass play from
quarterback Warner, playing for
the injured Steve Mitchell, to end
Doug Pinto. Chuck Hokanson
missed the try for point, giving the
Polymen a one-point bulge.
With seconds running out in the
first half, a fumbled pitchout in the
Poly end zone gave the Braves a
safety and an intermission lead of
8 to 7.
The JV's opened strongly in the
second half and drove to a score.
Halfback Bill McKay plunged into
the end zone following a sustained
downfield drive. Hokanson kicked
the all-important conversion which
proved the eventual winning mar
gin.
Cal Poly scored late in the con
test after driving the length of the
field.
