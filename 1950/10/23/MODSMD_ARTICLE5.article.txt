MOSCOW — President Truman's
San Francisco challenge to Russia
to change its policy if it really
wants peace was called hypocritical,
impudent, amusing, and nonsensical
today by Pravda, the newspaper
organ of the Communist party.
Discussing the President's invi
tation to Russia to lift the Iron
Curtain, permit the free exchange
of information and ideas, and join
a collective security organization
which will lead to disarmament and
the outlawing of atomic weapons,
Pravda said:
"Such an impudent and amusing
demand could have been conceived
only in the head of a war monger.
It is the United States that should
change its policy—a country which
forged the aggressive North Atlan
tic bloc, erected naval and air bases
in all corners of the earth, infringed
the national sovereignty and eco
nomic independence of the Mar
shallized countries, and is waging
bloody war in Korea."
