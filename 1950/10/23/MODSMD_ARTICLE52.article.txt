# Sail the Seas in Indian Style; Join Crew Today

### HILL WOOD 
If you are a young man of rea
sonable physical attributes and
have a hitherto suppressed desire
to sail the sea with an organization
second only to the United States
N;ivy, enlist now in the Stanford
crew.
The oarsmen, who last year won
a disputed third place at the Na
tional Intercollegiate Regatta at
Marietta, Ohio, are holding daily
afternoon workouts on the Palo
Alto estuary.
Varsity crew coach Jim Beggs
says that in spite of the fact that
five of last year's varsity lettermen
have returned to the fold, no defi
nite assignments will be made to
shells until all candidates have had
a chance to show their ability.
And, judging from the improve
ment shown by many of last year's
JV oarsmen, the race for first-shell
positions should be a close one.
Not to be overlooked in survey

ing crew prospects are the many
promising hopefuls of the freshman
crew. So far, frosh drills have been
confined to practicing fundamentals
in the rowing barge, but soon they
will get their first taste of the open
water in shells.
There is also a particular need in
the crew for launch drivers. And
for those with interests in nautical
mechanics, there -are openings for
shell maintenance men. All men
interested should get in touch with
Frank Jamison at the Phi Dclt
house.
A plan is now before the BAC
which would give the crew partial
support by the University — some
thing which they have done without
in previous years.
