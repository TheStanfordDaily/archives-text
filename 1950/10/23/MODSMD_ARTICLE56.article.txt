# Indian Horsehiders Prepare to Defend Baseball Championship This Spring
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Flying the mythical CIBA cham
pionship flag high over the Sunken
Diamond, Stanford's baseballers are
hard at it in preparation for a title
defense come spring.
Looking over new material,
working with battery units, and
getting back to fundamentals have
been the objectives of the abbre
viated fall workouts.
Everett Dean, head man for his
second diamond campaign, antici
pates a successful season only if the
new outfield and infield combina
tions, brought about by graduation
losses, perform up to potential. The
loss of nine veterans off last sea
son's championship club seriously
threatens the Injuns' hopes of re
taining the hard-won title.
Clegg, Shaw Back
The only infielder not returning
is Dave Melton, now signed up with
the San Francisco Seals, the Big
City's entry in the Pacific Coast
League. However, the loss of out
fielders Bud Klein, Charley Cole,
Bob Larson, and John Claypool has

necessitated the moving of first
baseman Dick Clegg and possibly
Tom Shaw to the outer gardens.
Right fielder Jim Trabucco might
be sidelined due to studies.
In the hurling department, Dave
Stott and Jack Heinen are out fac
ing the cold, cruel world. Their
duties should be handled quite ca
pably by the return of Joe Chez
and Roger Osenbaugh.
Chez was the mainstay of the
Card pitching staff, gathering a
season record of nine wins and one
loss, that at the hands of Washing
ton State in the northern playoffs.
Osenbaugh was injured and saw
little action. Bolstering the mound
corps will be prospects from last
year's freshman team, Bob Murphy
and Ron Boyer. Newcomers Jack
Alexander, Tony Stellar, and Glen
dale transfer Lloyd Westphal will
add needed insurance.
On the receiving end, the squad
is well off with the return of Dick
Corzine and Bill Herron, both vet
eran catchers. Jack Shepard, out
standing freshman catcher, will do
a bit of catching, but more prob
ably will aid the depleted group of
outfielders.
Walsh for Clegg
Looking at the inner defenses, the
initial bag is held down by Jim
Walsh, who now seems the logical

I choice to replace Clegg, who has
I been shifted to the outfield. Behind
Walsh will be Harold Hennesey
from Harbor JC.
At second, in the event football
| ing Tom Shaw moves to the out
field, will be either Art Abramson
or John Knoeppel. If these men
fail to show ejiough, Shaw will
move back to the position he han
dled well last spring.
Hot corner candidates are Bruce
, Iverson and Dick Cole, frosh short -
! stop sensation.
At shortstop will be Bruce Cam
] eron, a fugitive from third. Iverson
■ is also working out at the short
I patch.
Outfield Unknown
The outfield, usually the home of
the hitting power, /will be a com-
I pletely unknown quantity. Now the
i three outer posts are wide open.
The leading prospects to fill the
vacated positions are Clegg, Shep
ard, Dave Rozenkrastz, a Menlo
transfer, Harold Skillman, and Al
| Stellar.

Flying the mythical CIBA cham
pionship flag high over the Sunken
Diamond, Stanford's baseballers are
hard at it in preparation for a title
defense come spring.
Looking over new material,
working with battery units, and
getting back to fundamentals have
been the objectives of the abbre
viated fall workouts.
Everett Dean, head man for his
second diamond campaign, antici
pates a successful season only if the
new outfield and infield combina
tions, brought about by graduation
losses, perform up to potential. The
loss of nine veterans off last sea
son's championship club seriously
threatens the Injuns' hopes of re
taining the hard-won title.
Clegg, Shaw Back
The only infielder not returning
is Dave Melton, now signed up with
the San Francisco Seals, the Big
City's entry in the Pacific Coast
League. However, the loss of out
fielders Bud Klein, Charley Cole,
Bob Larson, and John Claypool has

necessitated the moving of first
baseman Dick Clegg and possibly
Tom Shaw to the outer gardens.
Right fielder Jim Trabucco might
be sidelined due to studies.
In the hurling department, Dave
Stott and Jack Heinen are out fac
ing the cold, cruel world. Their
duties should be handled quite ca
pably by the return of Joe Chez
and Roger Osenbaugh.
Chez was the mainstay of the
Card pitching staff, gathering a
season record of nine wins and one
loss, that at the hands of Washing
ton State in the northern playoffs.
Osenbaugh was injured and saw
little action. Bolstering the mound
corps will be prospects from last
year's freshman team, Bob Murphy
and Ron Boyer. Newcomers Jack
Alexander, Tony Stellar, and Glen
dale transfer Lloyd Westphal will
add needed insurance.
On the receiving end, the squad
is well off with the return of Dick
Corzine and Bill Herron, both vet
eran catchers. Jack Shepard, out
standing freshman catcher, will do
a bit of catching, but more prob
ably will aid the depleted group of
outfielders.
Walsh for Clegg
Looking at the inner defenses, the
initial bag is held down by Jim
Walsh, who now seems the logical

I choice to replace Clegg, who has
I been shifted to the outfield. Behind
Walsh will be Harold Hennesey
from Harbor JC.
At second, in the event football
| ing Tom Shaw moves to the out
field, will be either Art Abramson
or John Knoeppel. If these men
fail to show ejiough, Shaw will
move back to the position he han
dled well last spring.
Hot corner candidates are Bruce
, Iverson and Dick Cole, frosh short -
! stop sensation.
At shortstop will be Bruce Cam
] eron, a fugitive from third. Iverson
■ is also working out at the short
I patch.
Outfield Unknown
The outfield, usually the home of
the hitting power, /will be a com-
I pletely unknown quantity. Now the
i three outer posts are wide open.
The leading prospects to fill the
vacated positions are Clegg, Shep
ard, Dave Rozenkrastz, a Menlo
transfer, Harold Skillman, and Al
| Stellar.
