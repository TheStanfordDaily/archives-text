# Traffic Appeals Judged by Council
## 
### 
Two appeals on traffic violations
were the main topics on the Men's
Council agenda at its meeting last
Thursday night in thQ Excom room.
The appeal of a student who had
parked in a no-parking area near
the Village dining halls was grant
ed. His appeal was based on the
fact that there were no signs in the
area Jit the time prohibiting park
ing.
A second student appealed a
ticket for parking on the street in
back of Memorial Church on a
week night. The student stated
that one of the posts at the entrance
of the stx-cet was out when he en
tered.
The Council decided that the
presence of the white posts should
imply that the street is not open
to the public.
