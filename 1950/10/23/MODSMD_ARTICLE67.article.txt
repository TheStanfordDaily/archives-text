# Historian Asks West To Unite
## 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Smiling, .white-haired Arnold J.
Toynbee got down to cases last Fri
day night before 2,200 silent spec
tators who crammed Mem Aud, the
Little Theater, and the west patio
of Memorial Auditorium.
Speaking little of the "rediscov
ery of religion" he had emphasized
in a previous address that noon to
members of San Francisco's Com
monwealth Club, the wiry British
historian told his audience in rela
tively practical terms how the West
might unite to defeat Communism
by forming a common state.
Attired in a typically English,
conservative dark suit which con
trasted sharply with his flashing
smile and snow-white crest, Pro
fessor Toynbee advanced the opin
ion that only a "strong concentra
tion of political and military power
is the answer to the stopping of a
third world war."
"But," the learned historian
questioned, "will that center he
loeated in the United States or in
Russia? Further, will it he ac
complished with or without a
world war?"
Historian Toynbee took the view
of the optimistic Westerner. He in
dicated that a third world war (in
which space and time would mean
little) could be averted if Western
nations would unite in what he
called "a supra - national govern
ment . . . including parliamentary
control over all members." He said
such a government "must be situ
ated in North America."
Then the speaker explained what
lie meant by "supra-national."
First, by of example, he said
we could learn a lesson from Au
gustus Caesar, who brought about
a 400-year period of peace by com
promising the nationalistic tenden
cies of conquered lands with the
dominant ends of the Roman state.
Second, he said there is an area
of "edged truths" which have
caused supposedly "united" nations
eventually to dissolve their part
nership. Such truths, he said, must
be worked out "on a federal basis"
to insure harmony.
Finally Dr. Toynbee told his au
dience that it is a matter of urgency
that "we find a middle way that
does not scrap our national pasts—
but that will rather subordinate
those pasts and translate them into
common Western democratic ac
tion . . .
"I believe that a union around
the United States cannot be . . .
healthy . . . unless we face this
problem of creating some type of
common federal government for
the Western community as a
whole."
Later, he said "we must unite in
a way that is least painful to na
tional feelings."
Nary a cough could be heard
from the 1,700 persons seated in
Mem Aud as the learned historian
passed swiftly from one point to
the next in the course of his 42-
minute address, titled "The Politi
cal Future of the Western Commu
nity."
Speaking from notes which he
had scanned hastily during Stan
ford Professor Edgar E. Robinson's
introduction, Dr. Toynbee said an
army of Western nations would
soon be formed to "protect our
beachhcad in Western Europe."
But he returned to the theme of
his talk when he indicated that
such an army would fail in its pur
pose if it were not backed up by
a supra - national government in
which certain nationalistic ends and
sovereign powers are sacrificed.
He said the West no longer has
an unchallenged future—as it had
after the Mohammedan invasions
and the Crusades.
He said right now the Western
community is "groping for com
mon institutions and actions with
which to unite . .
Dr. Toynbee's talk was broadcast
throughout the campus via station
KZSU. In addition, it will be
brought into the home of at least
one enthusiast who had remem
bered to bring his movie camera
and record parts of the memorable
appcarance on celluloid.

in a previous address that noon to
members of San Francisco's Com
monwealth Club, the wiry British
historian told his audience in rela
tively practical terms how the West
might unite to defeat Communism
by forming a common state.
Attired in a typically English,
conservative dark suit which con
trasted sharply with his flashing
smile and snow-white crest, Pro
fessor Toynbee advanced the opin
ion that only a "strong concentra
tion of political and military power
is the answer to the stopping of a
third world war."
"But," the learned historian
questioned, "will that center he
loeated in the United States or in
Russia? Further, will it he ac
complished with or without a
world war?"
Historian Toynbee took the view
of the optimistic Westerner. He in
dicated that a third world war (in
which space and time would mean
little) could be averted if Western
nations would unite in what he
called "a supra - national govern
ment . . . including parliamentary
control over all members." He said
such a government "must be situ
ated in North America."
Then the speaker explained what
lie meant by "supra-national."
First, by of example, he said
we could learn a lesson from Au
gustus Caesar, who brought about
a 400-year period of peace by com
promising the nationalistic tenden
cies of conquered lands with the
dominant ends of the Roman state.
Second, he said there is an area
of "edged truths" which have
caused supposedly "united" nations
eventually to dissolve their part
nership. Such truths, he said, must
be worked out "on a federal basis"
to insure harmony.
Finally Dr. Toynbee told his au
dience that it is a matter of urgency
that "we find a middle way that
does not scrap our national pasts—
but that will rather subordinate
those pasts and translate them into
common Western democratic ac
tion . . .
"I believe that a union around
the United States cannot be . . .
healthy . . . unless we face this
problem of creating some type of
common federal government for
the Western community as a
whole."
Later, he said "we must unite in
a way that is least painful to na
tional feelings."
Nary a cough could be heard
from the 1,700 persons seated in
Mem Aud as the learned historian
passed swiftly from one point to
the next in the course of his 42-
minute address, titled "The Politi
cal Future of the Western Commu
nity."
Speaking from notes which he
had scanned hastily during Stan
ford Professor Edgar E. Robinson's
introduction, Dr. Toynbee said an
army of Western nations would
soon be formed to "protect our
beachhcad in Western Europe."
But he returned to the theme of
his talk when he indicated that
such an army would fail in its pur
pose if it were not backed up by
a supra - national government in
which certain nationalistic ends and
sovereign powers are sacrificed.
He said the West no longer has
an unchallenged future—as it had
after the Mohammedan invasions
and the Crusades.
He said right now the Western
community is "groping for com
mon institutions and actions with
which to unite . .
Dr. Toynbee's talk was broadcast
throughout the campus via station
KZSU. In addition, it will be
brought into the home of at least
one enthusiast who had remem
bered to bring his movie camera
and record parts of the memorable
appcarance on celluloid.
Professor Toynbee took ofT for
Princeton yesterday morning.
Smiling, .white-haired Arnold J.
Toynbee got down to cases last Fri
day night before 2,200 silent spec
tators who crammed Mem Aud, the
Little Theater, and the west patio
of Memorial Auditorium.
