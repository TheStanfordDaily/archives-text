# Theme Is Unification Of World
## 
### GEORGE BUCKLEY ROY HEMMING 
Professor Arnold Toynbee con
cluded his busy three-day visit to
Stanford by leading a round-table
discussion at the 11th Conference
of the Institute of American History
in Cubbcrley Auditorium on Satur
day afternoon.
The Pacific Coast historians and
Dr. Toynbee used as their theme
the unification of the world by the
West as the key to modern history.
Professor David Harris moderated
the discussion, with Professor Ed
gar E. Robinson presiding as chair
man.
Dr. Toynbee presented his thesis
that Westerners do not look at the
local history of the Western com
munity from the point of view of
mankind as a whole, but by looking
inward and studying the non-West
only in its relations with the West.
If we would choose the first ap
proach, he argued, we would rec
ognize that our civilization will
be remembered in history for the
effect we have had in unifying
the world through our technical
achievements — a unity that will
last as the only alternative to
man's self-destruction.
But technology, said Dr. Toyn
bee, is only busk of our civili
zation, and cannot fill the spiritual
vacuum. It provides the material
framewcr)'. for unifying the world,
but cannot contribute any positive
spiritual ideal.
Professor Merrill Spaulding of
the Hoover Institute challenged Dr.
Toynbee's thesis on the grounds
that the movement for human
emancipation also was a great con
tribution of the West. Spaulding
said that faith in man's progress as
exemplified by the West was a posi
tive force in the world and would
be significant as such in our his
tory.
Listing the outstanding land
marks in modern Western history,
Dr. Toynbee cited the invention of
ocean-going ships, the adoption of
military discipline, the change to
religious toleration, the rise of na
tionalism as a new religion, the ac
celeration of technical progress, and
most recently the rise of Commu
nism as a Western heresy.
He emphasized that the great
figures of our Western history
will be those who have taken part
in the unification process — not
Louis XIV or William 111. but
Peter the Great, Ghandi, Kemal,
Lenin, and Plutarco Calles.
Professor Carl Brand, however,
defended the right of contemporary
historians to study and teach paro
chial cultures within the West it
self.
Professor Robinson, in concluding
the meeting, suggested that the di
vergences of opinion reflected in
the round-table were centered in
the relationship between the tra
ditional religion of Christian civili
zation and the technological prog
ress of Western civilization.
