## Farm Drops Tough One To Bruins 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The Stanford "dream team" bub
ble was cruelly punctured Satur
day afternoon by an alert band of
UCLA Bruins that capitalized on
every break to capture a 21 to 7
homecoming upset over the previ
ously unbeaten Indians in the Los
Angeles Coliseum.
The Bruins scored twice in the
second quarter and once in the
third, all via the air route, before
allowing Stanford a consolation
tally late in the last period.
The win was UCLA's third of the
season against two losses and
bounced the Bruins back into Rose
Bowl contention after their chances
had been dimmed two weeks ago by
a one-point loss to Washington.
The Westwooders scored twice in
the second quarter and once in the
third, all via the airlanes, before
allowing Stanford a consolation
tally late in the final period.
Tom Shaw was the spearhead
of that lone Indian -bright spot.
He took over on the Stanford 21,
after the tossing of both G»ry
Kerkorian and Dick Horn had
proved totally ineffective through
out the contest, and completed
six of eight passes in the march
to pay dirt.
Eric Southwood got the touch
down after a ten-yard pass from
Shaw to Wilbur Taylor and a UCLA
penalty for having 12 men on the
field had moved the pigskin to the
Bruin two.
For the hosts, it was the passing
of sophomore reserve tailback Ted
Narleski which hit the jackpot for
all three tallies.
The fh'st was a six-yard heave to
6-ft. 5-in. Ernie Stockert with 13
minutes left in the first half; the
second, 11 minutes later and again
to Stockert, covered a total of 39
yards; and the third — when the
3,500 - strong Farm rooting contin
gent realized for sure that they
were backing a losing cause—was
a 22 - yard dipsy - doo affair that
Coach Red Sanders had been sav
ing all day.
It started as a forward to Boh
Wilkinson on the 15; but the
Southland idol latcralcd to Dave
Williams, and the big fullback,
never breaking his full - speed
stride, stormed past Russ Pom
emy and into the end zone.
The favored Indians were simply
not in the ball game after the first
three minutes. The statistics tell
us that Stanford netted more yard
ago, both on the ground and in the
air, than did the victors.
The Bruins not only capitalized
on the breaks — they made their
own. Or, perhaps more accurately,
t'-rir limping first - string tailback
Bob Moore, who appeared only to
handle the punting chores, made
the breaks —with a scries of boom
ing kicks that forced the Marchie
men to operate most of the after
noon from the wrong end of the
field.
The first Bruin touchdown re
sulted from a combination of a
Moore punt and an untimely fum
ble, Standing on his own 3ft, Moore
lifted a lofty boot that rolled dead
"n the Stanford eight, 53 yards from
the lino of scrimmage. On the first
play, Stanford fullback Bob Meyers
fumbled at the line of scrimmage,
the elusive pellet bounding all the
way to the 24 before Brock Stro
schoin recovered for UCLA.
That was the first real break,
and the Bruins didn't fail to cash
in. One pass to Bob Wilkinson
and two to Stockert did the trick,
putting the Indians in a hole they
never climbed out of.
With just two minutes of the half
remaining, it was a 25-yard gain
on an exchange of punts that moved
UCLA to the Stanford 39 and set
the stage for the second Narleski
to Stockert tally. The outsizod
Bruin end took the pass on the 25
1 _1 l_.l ll A. 1.1 - 11

and eluded three tncklcrs to go all
the way.
Then in the third quarter, Moore
kicked dead on the Indian two on a
punt that sailed all the way from
