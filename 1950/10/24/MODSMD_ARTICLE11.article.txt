# KOREA WAR
## Hope Fades For Rescue Of Captives 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 24 (UP) â€”
The South Korean 6th Division has
picked up the trail of a large num
ber of American prisoners of war
near the Manchurian border and is
trying to find them, American mili
tary advisers said today.
Two other United Nations spear
hads drove at will toward the Man
churian border today while others
fanned out through North Korea
in a fast-fading hope of rescuing
150 Americans from the hands of
Communist captors.
On both the east and west of the
Korean peninsula, United Nations
forces were within two days' mareh
of the Yalu River border with Man
churia.
Marine pilots reported to 10th
Corps headquarters at Wonsan that
one prong of the hard-driving, ten
nis - shoed South Korean Capitol
Division had pushed on beyond Cho
Ri on the east coast, 62 miles from
the Manchurian border.
British Push Ahead
Two other South Korean divi
sions were within 45 miles of the
border in their mid - peninsular
drive past Huichon toward Kangyc,
a possible refuge of Red Premier
Kim II Sung and his fleeing gen
erals.
On the west coast, British Com
monwealth forces crossed the
Chongchon River near Sinanju on
Monday and held a bridgehead for
advancing American armor 65 miles
from the Manchurian frontier.
Hopes of overtaking the infamous
prison train carrying about 150
American captives of murderous
Communist guards were fading. A
task force of the First South Korean
Division apparently had failed to
gain on the train, and officers here
feared that the American war pris
oners might already have met the
same fate as the 70 executed near
a railroad tunnel 40 miles north of
Pyongyang.
Reds Surrender
.So many thousands of Commu
nists were surrendering daily that
their captors no longer had an ac
curate count. However, the num
ber was known to have passed
120,000.
Allied operations above captured
Pyongyang took on the form of a
great, triangular wedge whose point
was above Uichon, 48 miles or less
from the Manchurian border, and
whose base rested at the key rail
and highway junctions of Sinanju
and Kukchang.
