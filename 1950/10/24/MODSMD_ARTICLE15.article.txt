# Chappie Gag Debut Slated
## 
### 
Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of the Old Boy!
His October Chaparral comes out
tomorrow, and it. will cost a mere 30
cents on any of the corners of the
Quad, or even the Cellar or the
Post Office, to secure your giant
copy of the Vocational Guidance
issue.
This first of the year's purport
edly mirthful magazines will hit the
stands replete with a vocational
guidance test, a job barometer, and
many yuks, boffos, smirks, and
chuckles to console you in case you
don't want to be vocationally guid
ed.
And the Old Boy advises you to
come early and be sure of a copy
of the new, big, funny, Wednesday
Chappie.
