the witness, the teacher who cor
rected the papers, and the students
involved.
The witness to the incident not
iced the students conferring at length
during an exam last week and felt
\hat they were comparing papers and
helping each other.
The report of the teacher who cor

there were a few similarities in the
three papers but not enough to draw
the conclusion that they were copied.

ousness of Honor Code violations to
the students and the severity of the
penalties attached to conviction.
