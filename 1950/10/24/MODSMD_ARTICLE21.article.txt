# Farm Coed Hurt In Highway Pileup
## 
### 
A Stanford coed was slightly in
jured Sunday night in a rear-end
collision involving five cars on Bay
shore Highway near San Mateo.
Jean Evans, Cubbcrley, received
a sprained ankle when the car in
which she was riding was hit from
behind by a Cadillac traveling at
high sneed. The student's car,
driven by Jack Golenor, Chi Psi,
had stopped at the end of a line
of stalled cars, and the driver of
the Cadillac apparently did not see
that they had stopped,
Golenor's car was badly damaged.
Four other persons were also in
jured in the accident.
