### 
One of Stanford's most generous benefactors—Judge George E.

two 40-student wings which will soon be added to Crothers Hall.
Passed by the Board of Trustees at its regular meeting last Thurs
day afternoon, the $348,000 dual-wing project will get underway a

week from Wednesday. The wings

tinez, the same firm that constructed
the original Crothers Hall two years
ago. Architects are University Plan
ning Director Eldridgc T. Spencer
and William C. Ambrose.

school dormitory into a U-shaped
building. Each will accommodate 40
students in 20 two-man rooms. The
