We always learn something new on the an
nual trip to the football game in Los Angeles.
This year we learned our team was not invinci
ble; we learned Los Angeles heat couldn t last
forever; and we learned it helps your perspec
tive to go off campus for a weekend and see
how the other schools operate.
V/hat we're referring to is the wonderful hos
pitality shown by the UCLA student body.
From the moment the band stepped off the train
Friday morning until the kickoff Friday after
noon, the Bruins were perfect hosts.

They furnished buses to transport the Stan
ford Band out to the West wood campus, arid
then led the band two meals on Friday. In ad
dition to that, they provided rooms for the band
and gave them a free swim in the men's pool.
Then on Friday night the UCLA campus
opened the doors of the rally barn dance to
Stanford students.

The great reception Stanford received from
UCLA meant a lot to us, but the question comes
up, "What did we learn from it?" This weekend
Washington will bring its band down to the
Stanford game, just as the Stanford Band flew
to Seattle last year.
The following Saturday rooters, bandsmen,
and just about everyone else from USC will in
vade the Farm.
The ASSU has a duty to fulfill in entertaining,
housing, and feeding these guests. Naturally
we don't have the financial resources which a
state university such as UCLA has. But with

some hard work and additional planning on the
part of special committees, space can be found
in dormitories, fraternities, and private rooms
for our visitors.
A committee to take care of the Washington
and USC students when they come to the foot
ball games is every bit as important as a
smoothly-operating pre-reg committee.

As far as we know, the students who drove
to the game were back in class this morning
with no broken arms or legs.
It's a praiseworthy feat when several stu
dents can make a trip south en masse and not
be involved in any serious auto accidents.

Around the campus, almost as many people
ride bicycles as operate cars. These people
plan their schedules on the basis of knowing
they will have a bike handy when they want to
go from one class to another.
When some thoughtless person "borrows" a
bike, it means someone else's plans will be de
layed, or he may be late to a lecture. It
shouldn't be necessary to lock a bicycle every
time you walk out of sight. It all fits into that
problem of how far the honor system should go.
One of the foreign students, whose bicycle
was stolen, said it is something which would
never happen in his country.
Little things like bicycles being taken for sev
eral days or even several hours create bad im
pressions which our exchange students take
back to their countries. They'd rather remem
ber the good things about Stanford.
