# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
We had a party Saturday night. Or maybe it was
three or four parties. I wouldn't know, and —believe
me—the following information is second hand. All I
know is what people have told me, but the general
consensus is that we (the Queen and I) had a party

Saturday night.
First place we went after what
we laughingly called "the game" •
was the Sigma Louie shindig out
at Bob Meyer's pleasant little
noith-of-Tarzana bungalow. It
was a BYOL job. Everybody was
drinking Old Forester, Bottled in
Bond, but me. I was guzzling Old
Maggipunto, Bottled in Clam

Shells. It was really good stuff —made out of slowly
fermented hydrochloric acid.
I'm still in the midst of my hang-over, which goes
to show that it was the greatest party of all time.
Tuesday, and I'm still about to die, with no relief in
sight.
Never did get to see Ginger, but oh the fems at Bob's
party. Don't know where the brothers found them,
but lead me there and toss my shoes away.
The pay-off to the Sigma Louie party was when I
bobbled up to this familiar looking chap (obviously
Stanford) and struck up a conversation. Since nobody
was talking football Saturday night (except in whis
pers), I—being very smooth —found out the guy was
interested in tennis.
So, being an old sports editor, I spent the next half
hour checking the kid out on the tennis game, of
which —naturally—I know nothing about. I told him

how great Larson and Sedgeman were and mentioned
that I was a pretty fair netter myself (in junior high
school).
I could tell the guy was interested; he wasn't exactly
taking notes, but he was impressed. So after a few
more drinks, I decided to introduce myself and really
give the kid a thrill. I thrust out a bourbon-drenched
hand, "My name is Al Berry," I bragged.
"I'm very glad to meet you," he smiled, "my name
is Ted Schroeder."
After that we went over to the Theta Wotsit brawl
in the Bev Hills home of one John Marin (Stanford,
'50). We got there early, about one, and John greeted
us with, "Nice to see you, you're the 89th and 90th
persons to come by." Poor John, he only invited 15
people.
It was a great party there, too. The Sigma Louies'
party, as I said, was BYO'L. John's was GGIMB.
Which means, "Get Greased, It's Marin's Bottle."
Lotsa nice people there, too, I'm told. Roy and Dick
Roberts and I did a threesome on the piano. But we
had to stop—it's so crowded dancing on the piano.
Had a long talk with Ann Cravath, who will be up
here this winter. That was really a joyful conversa
tion. Her father's team had just been blasted by win
less Navy, and her team (Stanford) had . . . Well,
we were gloom personified. I poured her a drink that
would have knocked out a mule, and the clever gurl
switched glasses on me.
I feel swell today.
By the way, how did the game turn out?
Oh, yes.
Well, I'll see you at the Egg tonight.
