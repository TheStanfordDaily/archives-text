# CAMPUS OPINION
## No Offense Intended 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to Philip Nasrallah's letter which you
printed under the heading of "Misleading Talk at
SCF," the Stanford Christian Fellowship apologizes
to Philip Nasrallah, because he was offended while a
guest at our meeting Tuesday night. It is not the
policy of Stanford Christian Fellowship to' speak
derogatorily of any creed or faith; we regret that
Philip felt that the speaker, Rev. Dwight Small, had
made "unkind references to Islam," because any such
statements, as Philip said, would be "alien to a true
and tolerant Christian faith."
Rather, it is the purpose of SCF' to present Jesus
Christ as Savior and Lord and the Christian faith in a
positive way, emphasizing their reality and validity,
knowing that the facts will speak for themselves.
We have not cross-checked Rev. Small's references,
nor have we asked him to defend his position.
We well recognize that it is quite possible that Rev.
Small's statements concerning "the degenerate state
of affairs in the Arab East in general and Egypt in
particular" were unsound, but we are confident that
he did not mean to be intolerant or derogatory, but
that he acted in good faith in presenting the facts as
his references stated them.
If any of the talk at SCF has been misleading in the
least, I know thaf Rev. Small is anxious to join with
Stanford Christian Fellowship in offering our sincere
apologies to Philip Nasrallah and to the other guests
and members who heard him speak lost Tuesday eve
ning.
