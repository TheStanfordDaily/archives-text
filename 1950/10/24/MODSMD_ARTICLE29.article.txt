# Extending the 'Standard'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
For the third time in the last two quarters at Stan
ford my bicycle has been illicitly borrowed, to put it
euphemistically. The inconvenience it causes in itself
is considerable, but it is even more distressing to ]>e

confronted with manifestation of such a disregard of
private property, especially here at Stanford.
Perhaps it is not a case of deliberate felony, but
when the bicycle is abandoned where it cannot be
found by police or the owner, it might as well be.
In connection with this I was struck by an article in
tlu October 1950 Header's Digest on "The Honor Sys
tem Works at Virginia"—the following paragraphs in
particular:
"University honor extends beyond the pure aca
demic. The three violations of it are cheating, stealing,
and lying.
"One of the warmest feelings the honor system gave
me was related to the lack of stealing. If a student is
carrying a load of valuable textbooks and decides he
wants to stroll over to the Corner—a cluster of shops
serving the University—he puts the books down, and
they 3tay whre he puts them. If he forgets a coat on
a hook outside the classroom, he can stop by for it
later with no anxiety as to its safety."
When will our Fundamental Standard be so uni
versally honored?
