To the Editor:
Just a word of praise for the Stanford Band whose
outstanding performance was the one bright spot of
the UCLA weekend.
At the Homecoming Parade, at the rally, and at the
game their snappy maneuvers and sharp playing
brought cheers of admiration from both student bodies.
Particularly noteworthy was the rocking chair that
rocked—the most spectacular stunt they have per
formed in the past several years.
This is just to assure all the rooters who remained
at home that their Stanford Band really gave the
southern alumni something to look at, and turned in
the only All-American performance of the weekend.
