# CONNECTICUT U.
## Sentiment For Negro Pledge Rises 
### 
The problem of race discrimina
tion was hit from two angles in a
recent edition of the University of
Connecticut's newspaper, Connecti
cut Campus.
A story broke on Phi Epsilon Pi
fraternity's attempt to break a
clause in its constitution regarding
the barring of Negroes from its or
ganization. During rushing season
the fraternity pledged A 1 Rogers,
Negro, freshman class president and
member of the varsity football
team.
The fraternity then notified its
national officers that it would with
draw from the national organization
if not permitted to initiate Rogers.
The national ruling body of Phi Ep
silon Pi sustained a blackball of
Rogers' name.
Ultimatum
The local chapter issued a two
week ultimatum to national head
quarters, promising withdrawal if
the blackball was not removed. The
action of the University of Connec
ticut chapter was supported by
chapters at several other colleges.
The university itself had issued
an earlier statement that no frater
nity or sorority could occupy uni
versity-owned buildings on univer
sity property if its constitution or
by - laws contained discriminatory
clauses on the basis of race, reli
gion, or country or national origin.
This was followed by student body
approval of an anti - discrimination
resolution.
Reconsideration
The Grand Council, ruling body
of the fraternity, decided to recon
sider A 1 Rogers' case.
In the same issue of the Connec
ticut Campus the formation of a
new fraternity, Beta Sigma Tau,
was announced. Its purpose was
stated as "doing away with discrim
ination," with "social life only sec
ondary."
The fraternity stated it would
permit no blackballs, only simple
majority vote in case of dissension.
They hope to "set the pace" for oth
er campus fraternities.
The fraternity exists only on pa
per at the present time, with 30
members signed up. Other chap
ters already exist and are particu
larly strong in the Midwest.
