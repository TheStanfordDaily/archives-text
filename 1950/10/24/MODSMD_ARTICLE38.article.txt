# Rank's Murder Film Clever But Shallow
## 
### GEORGE BUCKLEY ROY HEMMING 
The British studios of J. Arthur Rank have come up with a pro
vocative comedy in "Kind Hearts and Coronets," now at the Guild
in Menlo Park.
That it contains some clever tongue-in-cheek dialogue, many
unique touches, and fine performances from Alec Guinness, Joan

Greenwood, and Valerie Hobson is
not to be denied. But beyond that,
it falls considerably short of being
the brilliant satire it might have
been.
"Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a
story of murder—systematic mur-

de r — through
which a young
English
man (Denis
Price) places
himself directly
in line for a
dukedom. This
modern Richard
finds a dozen

persons ahead of him in entitle
ment, and so carefully plots the
removal of each.
Since the family to whose head
the "hero" aspires is composed of
a bunch of real characters (all of
them played by Guinness), comedy
—and not murder melodrama—be
comes the primary element in the
picture.
Though murder is a serious social
matter, it can be used to good comic
effect when it follows through with
an inherent indictment of the insti
tutions or personages who are the
subject of a satire—as Chaplin did
in "Monsieur Verdoux."
It might have shown that the
outcast son was really destroying
the thing he sought by the methods
he was using to achieve it.
The tone of the picture indicates,
however, that its writers conceived
of it only as entertainment; they do
not purport to carry any message.
The hero is a little too smug and
vitriolic to be the central figure in
a real comedy. His role, as written,
is so one-dimensional that it limits
an effective interplay between the
murderer and his victims, as Ver
doux did (to again use that exam
ple).
There are, to be sure, many
splendid parts. The cast does an
uncommonly good job, with Guin
ness having an acting field day with
eight roles, and Joan ' Greenwood
displaying a sophisticated sexiness.
In general the production is so
well done that it glosses over the
fact that the screen play really only
scratches the surface of its mate
rial. It is a clever but shallow
entertainment with a tremendous
potential lying dormant in its
framework.
