WASHINGTON â€” Chairman Carl i
Vinson revealed today that his
House Armed Services Committee j
is considering extending the draft j
from 21 months to two years and j
said it probably will be necessary to.
call men who arc now draft-proof, j
He also said Congress might be |
fooling itself if it enacts universal i
military service, because there may ,
not be enough men to fuel both the
draft and UMT. The best thing, he
said, would be to call up youths for j
two years' service when they turn
19.
