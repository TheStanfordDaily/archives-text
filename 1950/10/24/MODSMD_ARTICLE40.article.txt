## The 						Sporting Line

There were plenty of songs and good old-fashioned rah-rah spirit all the
way down on the airplane. It was a Stanford special headed for the UCLA
weekend. You could tell it by the red ties, the red cashmeres, the red skirts, 1
rooters' caps, pom-pons, and the songs. It was Stanford roughs and their |
gals whooping it up on their way to a big weekend. A sort of pre-Big Game j
bender and getting set for another Southern jaunt around 1951 time. The l
Big Red Machine was really ready, Marchie had the team all fired up for
their first big crucial, the alums rolled out the carpet (it was red, too), and
almost all the sports scribes had Stanford pegged for the favorite role. We
weren't heavily favored, but had just the stuff to hang a nice defeat on the
Baby Elue Bruins. Westbrook Pegler came back from the Army-Michigan
game with reports that Eastern writers were all set to come to Palo Alto on |
Nov. 18 and see Army have its only test against the power of the West— j
the Now Boys.
The trip back was rough. The heavens even joined in on the unhappi
iiesr. and let loose with the first big rain of the year. The Farm was
drenched with wet on Monday morning. There was only mumbling and
quiet whispers, no singing. There was disappointment and discontent.
There was even a law student who had waited six years for the BIG
YEAR; this was his last chance to see a winner, and now he had his
doubts.
What happened in between those plane trips is something a lot of us would
like to know. That wasn't a spirited Big Red Machine on the Coliseum turf.
They seemed to be lackadaisical, half-hearted in their attack. Sure they
;>te up yardage in the opening series. But from the beginning they dogged
it back to the huddles. They lacked hustle. And this was the time-consum
ing tactics that kept them from having enough time for a come-back, if one
could have been generated, at the end. The pass-receivers would miss, some
what complacently, and shuffle back to the huddles. Where was the snap
and fir?
This was the game that we were all pointing for, the game that half
the student hody went south for. Sure, the Bruins were all fired-up, but
we knew they would be. They always are. Our quarterbacking was off.
I'he vaunted passes were missing their mark. With one of the nation's
highly touted aerial games, the Stanford didn't have a completion until
well into the third period. Only a couple of half-hearted tosses to an
All-American receiver in the whole first half. The plays weren't mixed
up well; the timing was off. Tackling was better than it had ever been
this season, and the middle of the line stopped 'em cold. The Bruins !
gained only nine yards on the ground in the first half. There were the
things that were question marks before, but the Cards showed they had
the stuff. Never returning punts kept us in the hole all afternoon. The
safety man never had a chance with four or five Bruins around him
every time. What happened to the downfield blocking?
We all expected the Cards to roar back after halftime. But they didn't.
Still no fire. The Bruins scored on a play that everybody knew about. The
Brubabes had used it in the prelim, and an L.A. columnist had written about
it Friday. Even though our tackling was good most of the time, it was absent
at the crucial times. The team seemed to be waiting for the breaks. They
didn't come, and the ball game was over. The rooting section still couldn't
believe what they saw —on the scoreboard and on the field. What had hap
pened to the spirit, the will-to-win that the Reds came down to L.A. with?
There were two sharp-looking touts in those loud check jackets stand
ing by gate six as I walked out. They were talking about next Satur- {
day's Washington-Stanford game. Seems they were trying to figure out
the price.
"I don't think they can do it. Notre Dame didn't, so how can can you
expect those guys to. It won't even be close against Washington."
I disagree. We all know that the Big Red Machine has the stuff to win.
It all depends on whether they want to play ball next week.
