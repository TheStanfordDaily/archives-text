# Japanese Expert Fears Future Military Revival
## 
### JOAN SEAVER 
Militarism in Japan is not dead; its
possible resurgence is the greatest
tear of Japanese democrats who see
in the event of world conflict that
there will be no "neutrality" and no
"non-involvement" for any nation.
The Korean war taught the Japa
nese the urgency of national defense,
explained Dr. Nobutaka Ike, curator
ot the Hoover Library Japanese col
lection, last night in a United Nations
Day speech in Cubberley Audito
rium.

"The Japanese were greatly im
pressed by tiic United Nations action
in Korea; but they were also im
pressed by the military power of the
North Koreans. They know that
from now on armies of Asiatic satel
lite countries arc not going to be
pushovers," Dr. Ike said.
Since Korea, the people of Japan
are growing more and more toward
the belief that their defense problems
must be solved in the United Nations,
he added. By avoiding unilateral ac
tion. the United States can refute
Soviet propaganda that this coun
try is bent on reducing Japan to a
semi-colony.
"Selling the occupation to the
Japanese was like seiiing a cowboy
suit to a 6-year-old," Dr. Ike said.
"The impact of American civilization
is found everywhere—from drive-ins
to the Reader's Digest."
American Influence
Much of their enthusiasm for
Americanism is genuine, he believes,
but it cannot be expected to last for
ever. A desire for independence and
full-fledged membership in the world
community explains the eagerness
with which rumors of an impending
peace treaty are greeted in Japan.
Dr. Ike said that the Japanese may
1 have an exaggerated confidence in
1 the UN as a result of Korea. How
] ever, he expressed conviction that we
j have only to gain by attempting to
j solve through the United Nations the
I riddle of Japanese peace and dc
j fense.
