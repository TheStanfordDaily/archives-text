# Grotto Members Fail to Find Course of Underground River
## 
### PAULINE KUNZ 
Unlike the 3,500 Stanford fans
who trekked south to sec a football
game, nine members of the Stan
ford Grotto spent the weekend
looking for an underground river
near Santa Cruz.
The group attempted to trace the
disappearance of a river which
flowed into a limestone cave, called
the "Cave of the Dancing Spiders,"
for 40 feet and then disappeared
through an impassable aperture.
The cave explorers attempted to re
locate the stream by descending a
mine shaft, which they hoped inter
cepted the caverns and the stream
at a considerable depth. They de
scended 100 feet vertically and at
a 60-dcgree angle for another 100
feet. At this point, they ran out
of rope.
Never ones to be discouraged, the
men arc planning to return with a
1,000-foot rope and continue their
explorations of the subterranean
depths. They also plan to bring re
ceptacles to hold the seven-inch
long crickets that they found in the
"Cave of the Dancing Spiders."
The Grotto is presenting an il
lustrative report of their first two
years of cave explorations on the
second floor of the main library.
This exhibit, which is probably the
first comprehensive exhibit on Cali
fornia caves, will be on display for
two weeks.
