# Stanford Graduates Predict Success of World Federation
## 
### JOAN SEAVER 
Several Stanford students speak
from experience when they claim
the birth of the United Nations
merits this week of celebration.
From those who worked within,
and those who observed the United
Nations organization operate this
year, the consensus was this:
Despite national obstacles and or
ganizational faults, the UN will suc
ceed because it has no other choice.
Three winners of the United Na
tions Internship program within the
past two years were Stanford grad
uates.
David Chan, former president of
the Institute of International Rela
tions, held the single opening for an
intern last summer in the office of
Secretary-General Trygvc Lie. Don
Toussaint, '47, after two years at
the University of Peking, returned
to the Social Affairs Department of
the UN Secretariat.
Americans have a wildly unreal
istic attitude toward the UN, Tous
saint observed. They have either an
exaggerated confidence in the UN
or none at all.
The UN is expected to perform
miracles in international politics,
Toussaint said. The surprising fact
is the immense social and economic
progress the UN has made despite
meager financial backing, he added.
Toussaint worked in the collec
tion of material on welfare activi
ties of every country in the world.
When Iran, for instance, wrote in
with a plan to set up a social secu
rity system, it would have access to
development plans in the other
backward countries. Advisory ex
perts would be sent to Iran on re
quest. This is the work that goes
on, in spite of political turmoil, that
cannot bo overlooked.
There is no better place to locate
our confidence for the world's fu
ture, he said. But he discouraged a
blind faith that the UN can accom
plish the impossible with its pres
ent support.
Nancy LaMontagne, a Stanford
student in political science, watched
the UN in action one week before
the Korean war, when the College
Council for the United Nations held
its annual conference in New York.
She attended Trusteeship Council
meetings and heard interim
speeches by Security Council dele
gates.
The attitude she observed among
the workers and delegates in the

United Nations was one of confi
dence. So much had come out of j
the non-politica! work, they could j
not help believing in the future of
the organization even as it stepped
more decisively into the hazards of
international politics.
