HOLD THAT BEAR—Although Stanford yell leaders got the UCLA Bruin lassoed for a short time
during last Saturday's game, they didn't tie the knot hard enough. Left to right are Dave Dorwood
(slightly wounded by the Bruin's claws), Art Reidel, Ross Wilkey, and Jim Scott.

HEAP BIG SMOKE—But no fire. The Stanford Indian, card stunt styl<=, puffs at his peace pipe
during half time at the UCLA game. This particular stunt brought loud applause from the Bruin
rooting section and from fans on the opposite side of the Coliseum. It was one of 14 staged by
the Farm rooters. —Daily photo by Russ Lapham
