# Public Mourns Al Jolson
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 24 (UP)-AI
Jol son came home today to a
mourning show business world that
agreed the strain of entertaining
troops in Korea hastened his death.
The famous mammy singer died
last night of a heart attack in a
San Francisco hotel room, and to
the lost he quipped proudly about
his September tour of the battle
fronts to sing "April Showers" and
"Swance' 7 for the boys.
That trip, his mourners in Holly
wood said, quickened the death of
the man who for 50 years had been
"the world's greatest entertainer."
"A Ileal Patriot"
"Jolson was basically a real pa
triot. That means giving your life
to your country," his attorney, M.
D. Silverberg, said.
"He felt so deeply about this war.
It meant so much to him.
"His wife, Erie, his manager, Lou
Epstein, all his friends know Korea
did it."
The chartered plane bearing the
body of the dean of popular singers
landed at the Los Angeles Interna
tional Airport at .1:20 p.m. The
funeral was planned tentatively for
Thursday at Temple Israel in Hol
lywood.
His fourth wife the beautiful
Erie Galbraith, stayed grief-strick
en in seclusion at the Jolson ranch
home in Encino.

Silvcrbcrg said Jolson was sick
when ho returned from singing 43
exhausting shows, dodging sniper
bullets, and trampine through Ko
rean mud. He was the first star to
entertain in that war zone.
He was "pretty worn out and
complained of feeling badly," the
attorney said.
Harry Cohn, president of Co
lumbia Pictures where "The Jolson
Story'' broueht Al his brilliant
comeback, said the singer's "last
heroic effort in Korea was probably
his undoing."
Died "in Action"
"He died as he always lived—'in
action'," said Cohn. "With his death
passes a glamorous facet of show
business."
When Jolson returned from Ko
rea. he said his trip had been "a
helluva lot tougher" than his First
and Sccond World War junkets.
"I'm still jittery from a couple
of close shaves." he said then. "I
hopped from place to place in a
holicopfcr. I picked up* a bad cold,
too."
Rut at each stop Jolson spread
out his arms, dropped to one knee,
and hold his audience spellbound
with "Mamrny," just as he had since
he first sani? it at New York's Win
ter Garden in 1927.
Was to llrst
The man with the bij< grin and
twinklina eyes told friends he

would take a long rest this month.
Instead, he worked for four weeks
with producer Jerry Wald on a
movie about his famed battlcfront
tours that cost him his life.
"It would have been a great pic
ture, said Wald. "Al always gave
al! he had to anyone who needed it.
The Gl's know that better than
anybody. . .
Jolson then went to San Fran
cisco to appear on Bing Crosby's
radio show. After dinner and a re
hearsal, the singer and two old
friends, Harry Akst and Martin
Fried, were playing pin rummy in
Jolson's hotel room. At 9:30 p.m.
Jolson complained of "indigestion."
His friends persuaded him to lie
down in bed.
"Looks I>ike the End"
"Well, this looks like the end,"
Jo'son said, and smiled.
"Pull up some chairs. I've got
some stories to tell you."
"Hell, Truman had only one hour
with MaeArthur," lie grinned. "I
had two!"
Show business was stunned by
Jolson's death.
Hollywood was glad that before
his death he experienced the most
famous comeback in entertainment
history, that brought him more
fame than his triumphant lirst ca
reer in Broadway shows like "Won
der Bar" and "Sinhad."

HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 24 (UP)-AI
Jol son came home today to a
mourning show business world that
agreed the strain of entertaining
troops in Korea hastened his death.
The famous mammy singer died
last night of a heart attack in a
San Francisco hotel room, and to
the lost he quipped proudly about
his September tour of the battle
fronts to sing "April Showers" and
"Swance' 7 for the boys.
That trip, his mourners in Holly
wood said, quickened the death of
the man who for 50 years had been
"the world's greatest entertainer."
"A Ileal Patriot"
"Jolson was basically a real pa
triot. That means giving your life
to your country," his attorney, M.
D. Silverberg, said.
"He felt so deeply about this war.
It meant so much to him.
"His wife, Erie, his manager, Lou
Epstein, all his friends know Korea
did it."
The chartered plane bearing the
body of the dean of popular singers
landed at the Los Angeles Interna
tional Airport at .1:20 p.m. The
funeral was planned tentatively for
Thursday at Temple Israel in Hol
lywood.
His fourth wife the beautiful
Erie Galbraith, stayed grief-strick
en in seclusion at the Jolson ranch
home in Encino.

Silvcrbcrg said Jolson was sick
when ho returned from singing 43
exhausting shows, dodging sniper
bullets, and trampine through Ko
rean mud. He was the first star to
entertain in that war zone.
He was "pretty worn out and
complained of feeling badly," the
attorney said.
Harry Cohn, president of Co
lumbia Pictures where "The Jolson
Story'' broueht Al his brilliant
comeback, said the singer's "last
heroic effort in Korea was probably
his undoing."
Died "in Action"
"He died as he always lived—'in
action'," said Cohn. "With his death
passes a glamorous facet of show
business."
When Jolson returned from Ko
rea. he said his trip had been "a
helluva lot tougher" than his First
and Sccond World War junkets.
"I'm still jittery from a couple
of close shaves." he said then. "I
hopped from place to place in a
holicopfcr. I picked up* a bad cold,
too."
Rut at each stop Jolson spread
out his arms, dropped to one knee,
and hold his audience spellbound
with "Mamrny," just as he had since
he first sani? it at New York's Win
ter Garden in 1927.
Was to llrst
The man with the bij< grin and
twinklina eyes told friends he

would take a long rest this month.
Instead, he worked for four weeks
with producer Jerry Wald on a
movie about his famed battlcfront
tours that cost him his life.
"It would have been a great pic
ture, said Wald. "Al always gave
al! he had to anyone who needed it.
The Gl's know that better than
anybody. . .
Jolson then went to San Fran
cisco to appear on Bing Crosby's
radio show. After dinner and a re
