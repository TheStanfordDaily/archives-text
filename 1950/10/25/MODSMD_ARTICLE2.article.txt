PYONGYANG, Korea, Oct. 2iâ€”
The grim secrets of Pyongyang
prison were bared today when for
mer inmates, now guards, said they
believed that possibly 1,500 political
prisoners had been murdered and
buried there, some of them buried
alive.
American prisoner of war teams
entered the nates for the first time
Monday and found evidence of
more Communist atrocities. The
prison now holds more than 5,000
North Korean prisoners of war and
their numbers arc swelling.
