A new student committee w.ts
created at Stanford last night.
In a surprise move ASSU Pres
ident Ted Buttner, working with
Cardinals, created a Hospitality
Committee or Public Relations
group to handle Stanford's rela
tions with visiting schools for
the remainder of the 1950 foot
ball season.
Chairman of the new body i;
Cardinals member Marion Brum
mel. Other members of the six-man
board are ASSU Vicc-Prcsidcnt .J<>
Lyon, Rally Com Chairman Hicks
Williams, and Band Manager Jat k
Blumberg. Representatives from the
fraternities and the women's How
houses arc yet to be named.
Buttner stated that the new
group was a direct outgrow'h of
yesterday's Daily editorial calling
for a spccial committee to lake
care of Washington and USC stu
dents expccted here with their foot
ball teams.
The need for a show of more hos
pitality to visiting students was
discussed in the regular Cardinal;
meeting and Marion Brummcl was
appointed public relations chair
man. In an informal session with
Buttner following the Cardinals
meeting the new Hospitality Com
mittee was organized.
"The idea of a committee of this
type has been in mind for some
time. Student reaction to the fin'
treatment received at UCLA and
the Daily editorial brought things
to a head tonight," Buttner said.
At present, the committee is tem
porary and will function only dur
ing the present football season.
"However," said Buttner, "the
framework is set up and we arc
hoping to make this a permanent
addition to the student organiza
tion."
Talks with Fred Glover, Stanford
publicity director, are in the offing
to get his advice on the organiza
tion of a permanent student com -
mittee on public relations.
