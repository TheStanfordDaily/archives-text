# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
I see where Life has devoted an entire issue to a
discussion of U.S. education. Seems only fair what
with U.S. education spending most of its time discus
sing Life.
But it is gratilying to see that our great magazines

are interested in promoting the
cause of American education, even
it it does seem like journalistic
hara-kiri . . . someone ought to
tell thrni, the more people in this
country they gel educated, the less
readers they'll have.
They must know they've got
nothing to worry about around
here, though . . . Stanford's got

the only college bookstore in the country that sells
hound editions of Life. In fact, 1 hear the Ed Dept. is
making it a required text for visual aids . . . that's
the course where illiteracy is the only prerequisite.
I was very young when I came under the influence
of Life . . . with a rolled-up copy in her hand mother
could hit like a mule. And I remember every Sunday
morning the whole family used to put on its best
clothes and gather in the parlor where father would
stretch out his prayer rug and chant to us from the
latest issue.
But 1 was a sensitive child and those periodic ar
ticles on anatomy or medicine with their full-page
colored plates had a strong effect on me. One day I
was idly thumbing through an issue looking to see
how many pictures of pretty automobiles I could find
when 1 turned the page and found myself smack-dab
in somebody's stomach . . . the shock was so great I
went around for two years thinking I was an undi
gested watermelon seed.
But, getting back to that article on education, it was

interesting to note how seriously Life took its subject
. . . they had three full pages on curricula, teaching
standards, facilities, etc., and only forty-seven on
various aspects of college football. They seemed to
feel U.S. education is facing its biggest crisis since the
Scopes Monkey Trial, what with the rising cost of
good football players.
All I got *ay is somebody sure lost his head
around here when all that money was spent for the
new Law School . . . that new lounge in the base
ment alone cost us two tackles and a halfback.
But losing them because we don't have the money
is one thing, and losing them because we won't take
their girl friends is another ... I hear when Steve
Turner and friend wound up at Cal the sororities
found out she'd been refused by Stanford and gave
her the biggest rush in history.
One interesting feature of Life's article was the poll
they took of public opinion in regard to education.
Seems a good many people l feel our schools don't
teach us to think ... I ask you, isn't that silly? How
many times have you seen a 'teen-age Drofnat with
six beers in him whip out his old Cub Scout member
ship card and convince the B. of E. he stood beside
Lincoln at Gettysburg? II that isn't thinking, what is?
Life made a mistake, though, when they polled my
father . . . they found out he'd been sending his son
to college for the past 10 years and asked him what he
thought of U.S. education. We live in a quiet com
munityâ€”they gave him 10 days for disturbing the
peace.
THOUGHT FOR BIG GAME NIGHT
Hear and Bruin, we are told,
Come from one same family fold . . .
So when it comes time to play the other,
Pray like mad he's the idiot brother.
