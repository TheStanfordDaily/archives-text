# CAMPUS OPINION
## Condemning the 'Loyalty Oath' 
### 
To the Editor:
I have been asked by some of my off-campus con
stituents to present to Excom tonight the following
petition:
We, the undersigned, registered students and faculty
of Stanford University, hereby request the ASSU
Excom to pass the following resolution:
Resolved: The Stanford Executive Committee of
ASSU, being the elected representatives of the stu
dent body of Stanford University, condemns the
Loyalty Oath of the University of California re
quired by its Board of Regents as a violation of aca
demic freedom and as a threat to the advancement
«»f knowledge and truth.
As students of a university in a tree country we
feel it is our duty to condemn any infringement on
the light of any scholar, student, or teacher, to the
free pursuit of knowledge, especially when such an
iniringenient occurs in an institution so closely re
lated to ours. Realizing that there is an obvious
limitation to compromise, we pledge our support and
sympathy in safeguarding the democratic principles
which we so cherish.
r l lie response to the signing of this petition has been
varied. It has ranged from "It's none of our business"
to "What good will it do?" to "It's a tremendous idea."
In essence the purpose ol this resolution is clearly
one of affirming a moral principle. Aside from those
students who favor loyalty oaths in universities and
those who are just apathetic, there are many stu
<h lit ', mysell among them, who leel that there is noth
ing more worthwhile fighting for and maintaining than
academic freedom and free expression of ideas.
'1 he argument that a violation of academic freedom
;.t Cal is none ol our business is at first absurd, after
.•cine reflection, very serious. I am supporting this
levolution because I believe that it is our responsi
bility to other students and the community as a v/hole
to : tiite our beliels on this issue. A denial ol our re
sponsibility to others (in any sphere) is undiluted
stlfi hness (and possibly in keeping with a segment of
the "Stanford tradition."
The academic arguments against a loyalty oath in a
university need not be advanced here. They are con

sistent with democratic ideals. The question is whether
we, as Stanford students, have a role to play outside
the cloistered walls of Stanford; i.e., whether we are
going to permit ourselves to be prepared for the ac
ceptance of the responsibilities of a citizen now and
alter we graduate.
One thing more—Remember what they said at Cal?
They said: "It can't happen here!" It did. It can hap
pen at Stanford, 100, or any other place where we take
our democratic principles for granted, get carried
away in a period of hysteria, and fall asleep at the
wheel.

the "Stanford tradition."
The academic arguments against a loyalty oath in a
university need not be advanced here. They are con

sistent with democratic ideals. The question is whether
we, as Stanford students, have a role to play outside
the cloistered walls of Stanford; i.e., whether we are
going to permit ourselves to be prepared for the ac
ceptance of the responsibilities of a citizen now and
alter we graduate.
One thing more—Remember what they said at Cal?
They said: "It can't happen here!" It did. It can hap
pen at Stanford, 100, or any other place where we take
our democratic principles for granted, get carried
away in a period of hysteria, and fall asleep at the
wheel.

To the Editor:
I have been asked by some of my off-campus con
stituents to present to Excom tonight the following
petition:
We, the undersigned, registered students and faculty
of Stanford University, hereby request the ASSU
Excom to pass the following resolution:
Resolved: The Stanford Executive Committee of
ASSU, being the elected representatives of the stu
dent body of Stanford University, condemns the
Loyalty Oath of the University of California re
quired by its Board of Regents as a violation of aca
demic freedom and as a threat to the advancement
«»f knowledge and truth.
As students of a university in a tree country we
feel it is our duty to condemn any infringement on
the light of any scholar, student, or teacher, to the
free pursuit of knowledge, especially when such an
iniringenient occurs in an institution so closely re
lated to ours. Realizing that there is an obvious
limitation to compromise, we pledge our support and
sympathy in safeguarding the democratic principles
which we so cherish.
r l lie response to the signing of this petition has been
varied. It has ranged from "It's none of our business"
to "What good will it do?" to "It's a tremendous idea."
In essence the purpose ol this resolution is clearly
one of affirming a moral principle. Aside from those
students who favor loyalty oaths in universities and
those who are just apathetic, there are many stu
<h lit ', mysell among them, who leel that there is noth
ing more worthwhile fighting for and maintaining than
academic freedom and free expression of ideas.
'1 he argument that a violation of academic freedom
;.t Cal is none ol our business is at first absurd, after
.•cine reflection, very serious. I am supporting this
levolution because I believe that it is our responsi
bility to other students and the community as a v/hole
to : tiite our beliels on this issue. A denial ol our re
sponsibility to others (in any sphere) is undiluted
stlfi hness (and possibly in keeping with a segment of
the "Stanford tradition."
