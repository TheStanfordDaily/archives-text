# The Atlantic Union Cause

### 
To the Editor:
In discussing "The Political Future of the Western
Community" last Friday night, Professor Toynbee
made clear his belief that liberty and progress depend
upon the forging of a more perfect union among the
democratic peoples of the world.
ATLANTIC UNION is an organization of citizens
who are working for that goal. Toynbee used the
phrase "Atlantic Union' only once or twice during his
address, but it was very evident that he ardently be
lieves in the cause for which Atlantic Unionists are
striving. As he was leaving Memorial Auditorium
alter his lecture, one of us put to him the question,
"Do you l'avor the Atlantic Union proposal?" His
answer was prompt i;nd emphatic. "Most assuredly,"
lie said.
The Stanford Chapter of ATLANTIC UNION wel
comes into membership all students who are willing
to help build thi j foundations of enduring peace,
through a union of the free democracies. Our program
is wholly consistent with the United Nations, as well
as with the. preservation of our national traditions and
culture. Wo work for a union with those peoples whose
values and goals, like our own, mean dignity and de
cency in living, 'his part ol our destiny we hold in
our hands. Uhited, we can hold it securely.
