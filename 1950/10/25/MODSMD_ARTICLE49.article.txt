# Architect Displays On Exhibit
## 
### 
"Architects of the Bay Region" is
the current exhibit at the Stanford
Art Gallery. The whole exhibit was
last shown at the San Francisco
Museum of Art.
The featured display is Ranchito
La Sonadora, a Mexican dream
house called a "cloud castle." The
name Sonadora is Spanish for the
word dreamer.
Each of the 10 separate displays,
including La Sonadora and nine
modern homes in the San Francisco
Bay Region, has a detailed house
plan and several large photographs
of the setting and main rooms. In
formation with each display tells of
the problems faced by the architect,
as to the owner's requirements, site,
climate, and family size, and how
he successfully arrived at a solu
tion.
A San Francisco business man
about to retire, the owner of the
Mexican dream home, several years
ago asked two San Francisco archi
tects to design the home he had in
mind.
The setting was a lush hill high
above a valley in Mexico watered
by a river from an underground
cave. The combination of new ar
chitecture and old tradition that
resulted took a crew of 50 crafts
men and peons three years to com
plete, using the same techniques of
Btone-cutting and tile-setting that
were used to raise the Indian tem
ples.
Among problems faced by archi
tects of the nine Bay Area homes
were a beach cottage for a family
of four, a spacious San Francisco
home on a flat, narrow lot 30 feet
wide, and an expandable house
which could in time be doubled or
even tripled in space.
