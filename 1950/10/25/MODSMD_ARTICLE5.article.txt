F LUSHING, N.Y.â€”President
Truman today called for "revital
ized" United Nations disarmament
talks but warned that the West will
continue to arm until a "fool-proof"
disarmament pact is signed.
In a major foreign policy pro
nouncement, Mr. Truman suggested
the creation of a "new and con
solidated disarmament commission"
which could discuss the reduction
of both atomic and non - atomic
weapons.
Mr. Truman, addressing a spe
cial session of the General Assem
bly marking the fifth anniversary
of the organization, emphasized
that any disarmament pact "must
include all kinds of weapons."
