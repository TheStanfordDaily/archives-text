### 
Among the rooters who trav
eled south last weekend, prob
ably none were more daring than
Charles Newman and Bob Legge
who covered the 900 miles in
Newman's colorful, top'ess '2G
Buick roadster.
The yellow, green, and black
relic was "Hawless in perform
ance'' the entire journey, said
Newman. The only mishap was a
flat tire on a Los Angeles boule
vard. "The lack of any trouble
was almost boring," claimed the
owner.
The interesting part of the trip,
according to Newman, was going
down Friday afternoon. "Students
who passed us about 50 miles out
just grinned and thought we were
kidding. Around 100 miles, some
scratched their heads in wonder
ment.
"After 150 miles, though," he
concluded, "they started cheering
and honking their horns."
