OK, now about the UCLA game.
I've cheered for a lot of Stanford teams that didn't look like they had any
material. I've cheered for a lot of Stanford teams that were loaded but lost
to better teams. Last Saturday I had the dubious distinction of trying to
cheer ior a Stanford team that didn't seem to care.
I don't to sxy that all of the grid guys spent the clay admiring the blue
LA skies, or trying to see that their numbers were always prominent
for (be television cameras. That's not true. A half dozen or so guys
played their guts out, and were hitting just as hard the last play of the
game as they were the first. I won't try to enumerate all of then? because
1 haven't seen the pictures and if I tried to tell you all the guys who were
magnificent, I would undoubtedly leave someone out—even though it is
a remarkably small list. Poineroy, Manoogian, and Cone were three who
Come to mind. There are others.
Then there were a bunch of Indians who literally stunk up the Coliseum,
not because they weren't trying but because they had a bad day or because
tl.ey tied up in the clutch. These men deserve credit for their "heart" and
"desire," but not much can be said about their dependability.
Then there are the rest of the boys.
Well, I'll drop this line now. The guys without the desire should be suf
ficiently ashamed and humiliated by what the Baby Bluers did, and they
don't need a hack writer to rub it in. The others, mostly in the defensive
line, have nothing to be ashamed 01. It wasn't their fault that their team
mates let them down.
Technically, here is what happened Saturday.
1. UCLA merely went out and kicked hell out of us. Their punting kept
us in a hole that a completely miserable Stanford offense couldn't get out of.
2. Stanford's vaunted offense simply wasn't there. This is due partly io
exceedingly poor quarterbacking from a couple of guys who I think are fine
QBs. r l hey called the wrong plays at the right time, and their passing was the
worst I've seen on the Farm in four years of anguished Saturday afternoons.
But the quarterbacks can, and probably are, being given too much of the
blame. Some of our more outstanding halfbacks, the guys I've always con
sidered to be Stanford's greatest "come-through" men, didn't quit—they
didn't do anything to quit from.
Having Jack Rye. Bruce Van Alstyne (especially), Owen Powell,
and Bob Scott injured hurt us tremendously. They didn't hurt us so
much that we should have lost, but their absence was a very bad break.
4. Our offensive line couldn't or wouldn't block anybody. Nice, huh?
5. The Bruins played a fine defensive game. They played the odds and
waited for the breaks. They won, 21 to 7.
For those of you who want to compare this last UCLA game with the
lid!) affair, there is some similarity. The Bruins played the same kind of
an effective, hard-hitting, waiting game. There is one big difference,
however. In 1949, Stanford out-hit, out-fought, and out-played UCLA
even in defeat. Last Saturday there was never any question which was
the better TEAM on the field. Forget that first-downs and yards-gained
on -the-ground stuff. It was UCLA's ball game from start to finish and
they never let us forget it. On paper (the game wasn't played on paper)
the Cards had the Bruins, in spite of injuries; the Indians are better, man
for man, in nearly every position. We didn't play them man for man;
football is a team game.
Oh, to hell with it. It's a damn silly schoolboy game anyway. I guess I'm
mad and very disappointed. I thought our guys were great. They didn't look
it Saturday. They are sorry. I'm sorry. The coaches are sorry. Everybody
is sorry. Except UCLA. They beat us, 21 to 7.
As for the Washington game next week: Van Alstyne will still be out, and
Tex White is sporting a cast. Pomeroy, Cone, and Manoogian and a few
others will still play their hearts out. But Washington, with a fine passing
attack and a great ground game, has proved themselves to be a wonderful
looiball team. Stanford hasn't. Washington: by 14 points.
