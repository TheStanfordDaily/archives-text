# Tex White Out As Cards Prep
## 
### 
Stanford's injury situation took a
turn for the worse and then for the
better yesterday.
Gordy "Tex" White, first - string
tackle, is hobbling around with a
cast on his ankle. The ankle, though
not broken, is not responding to
treatment, so the medics put on the
cast for precautionary measures. He
will definitely miss this Saturday's
Washington tilt. How much longer
the big co-captain will be incapaci
tated is anybody's guess.
On the other side of the ledger,
Owen Powell, stellar guard, scrim
maged for the first time yesterday,
and is all set for the Huskies. Bob
Scott may also see action.
The Indians ran through a spir
ited defensive and offensive scrim
mage under the lights yesterday.
The offense, with Harry Hugasian
especially noticeable, scored at will
against the frosh, while the defen
sive team hustled against the jayvee
offense.
Passing was particularly stressed.
