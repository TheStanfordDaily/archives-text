# L.A. GAME
## Farm Fans Frustrated 
### PETE GROTHE 
The several thousand Stanford
students who listened *o the UCLA
game on the radio last Saturday
probably wished that Marconi had
stood in bed when he considered
inventing the wireless.
It wasn't that the Card supporters
didn't want to hear the results,
either good or bad—it was the man
ner in which the game was broad
cast. The announcer, one Ken Pe
ters, got so carried away when
UCLA sparkled and showed so
little concern when Stanford made
a gain that students from the
heights of Hoover Tower to the
depths of the Cellar have been com
plaining about the shabby radio
treatment the Farm kids received.
Following are two of the many
faux pas that the poor man's Bill
Stern pulled: "UCLA has the
ball on their own 25-yard line.
Howard Hansen takes the ball
around right end; he's got the
whole Stanford defense outfoxed,
and he's ALL the way up to the
27-yard line on a BEAUTIFUL
run by Howie Hansen!!!"
Another one: "Stanford's ball
on their own 32, first and 10 to
go. Gary Kerkorian calling sig
nals; he gives the ball to Bobby
White, and White's SNOWED un
der by the WHOLE Bruin line.
Now it will be second and five
for—
Peters screeched like he had just
witnessed the explosion at Bikini
when Hansen made nine yards to
the 50. (It didn't even go for a first
down.)
On the other hand, when Harry
Hugasian accepted a reverse from
Kerkorian and scooted some 30-odd
yards, Peters made it sound like a
fullback for the YMCA Class D
Pygmy League had made a yard
through the middle.
All during the first half he
stressed that Stanford was going
nowhere against the stiff UCLA de
fense and that the Bruin offense
was going wild.
Oh, yes, the rushing statistics
were sheepishly announced at half
time — Stanford, 117 yards, and
UCLA? UCLA made nine (9!).
