SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 24 (UP)-
The University ol Washington, al
ready crippled by loss of four reg
ulars, was further burdened by a
heavy downpour of rain today as
the Huskies prepared for Satur
day's game against Stanford in nor
mally dry Palo Alto.
Coach Howie Odell said line
backer Bill Peterson would be out
of the Stanford game with injuries
and that tackle Jim Mangan would
see little, if any action. Odell also
suspended regular end Fritz Apking
one week for breaking training and
said defensive quarterback Anse
McCullough has been asked to give
up football because he "appears to
be ill."
