## Dean Trims Varsity to Twenty 
### 
The varsity basketball squad was
cut to 20 members yesterday by
Head Coach Everett Dean.
Survivors of Dean's final cage
trimming include 10 men from last
year's varsity and junior varsity,
four JC transfers, and six players
up from the frosh.
Heading Stanford's veterans are
first-stringers Jim Ramstead, cen
ter; Jim Walsh, forward; and Jack
O'Sullivan, forward. Other return
ing varsity men are Bruce Iverson,
Ron Garver, Gary Andrews. Paul
Watson, Dan Evans, Carl Davis,
and Sid Hasler.
Dean expects plenty of help this
season from junior college transfers
Ed Tucker (Compton), George Goto
(Placer), Ray Franceschini (Las
sen), and Tom Dufour (Santa
Rosa).
Up from Coach Bob Burnett's
1950 freshman team are Fritz Fen

ster, George Zaninovich, Wade Mc-
Cluyky, Paul Johnson, Dan Wil
bur, and Bill Stevenson.
This year's Card varsity, which
can be rated no more than a dark
horse for the PCC title, will take
an extended Eastern trip during the
Christmas holidays. The Indians'
opponents will include Michigan,
NYU, Cornell, Penn, and Utah.
