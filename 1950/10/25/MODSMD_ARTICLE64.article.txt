# 'Old Boy' Hammers Out Fifty Years of Humor for Chaparral
## 
### CORNELIA LITTLE 
A small silver hammer tapped us gently on the shoulder the
other day, and a cheerful voice said, "Remember me?"
"Of course we remember you," we said, turning and speaking to
the familiar figure in the red jester's outfit. "You are the Creaking
One, the hammer-wielder, the Old Boy, the Stanford Chaparral

itself, and you have just turned fifty
one."
"That's right," he said smugly.
"The fourth oldest college humor
magazine in the country, consistently
rated by impartial observers, includ
ing the Foolish Child himself, as one
of the three best; the only—"
"Oh, come on, we've heard all that,"
we cut him off.
Remember When?
"I see," he chortled, "you want
reminiscences from the Ancient Rep
robate." And before we had time to
agree, he continued:
"I was young in the days when the
University was young—in the days
when enrollment was so small the
Chaparral could afford to give all
campus beer parties—in the chival
rous time of sentimental rondels,
Gibson-type girls, the junior plug—"
"The junior plug?"
"An old, battered plug hat that
was regulation for members of the
junior class. It was a sad day for
Stanford when the junior plug was
abolished, and the Chappies wore 'cm
in protest for years afterward."
Chivalry
"And chivalry," we said. "Are you
sure?" And pulling out a copy of the
Chaparral, Volume One, No. One, we
l reminded him of a typical 1899 Chap
j pie joke that went something like
J this:
"He: Troffler is a queer fellow.
Said he would kiss every girl in
Roble before the year was out.
"She: How could he think of such
a thing?
"He: Sense of charity, I suppose."
"Wc used to have a Women's Edi
tion though," said tlic Ancient One.
"Did you know that Margery Bailey
of the English Department and Edith
Mirriclecs of the 'Pacific Spectator'
were among our —"
"Old girls?" we inquired.
"Chapitas. But you know, there
are perils in this humor business. Do
you realize that there was a time
when a Chaparral editor was booted
| from school every other year or so?"
"I suppose the University didn't sec
things your way."
"Gratis By Request"
"Some of those 'graduates by re
quest' did quite well for themselves
later, too. Take the Irwins, for cx
j Jiinple. Wallace, one of our Old Boys,
! was finally expelled on a rigged-up
charge. He's the one who coined that
phrase 'graduates by request.' Used
it in one of his many successful
poems. His brother, Will, was a
Chappie, too; legend has it that he
was kicked out for stealing some of
President Jordan's prize hens and
then serving the President a chicken
dinner. He became a newspaperman,
j won the Pulitzer Prize for his report
ing of the San Francisco earthquake.
And, of course, there's Winstead
Weaver, another well-known Chap
pie, who never exactly received a
Stanford diploma."
"Winstead Weaver?" we inquired.
"Better known as Doodles," he ex
plained. "Ah, we've had a colorful
history — rum-running, persecuting
the 'Doily,' jumping in the Union

Court fountain—"
"Tell me just one thing," we said.
"How did you ever find time to put
out a magazine?"
"Well, I'm not quite sure myself,"
he said, "but wo always come
through. As a matter of fact, the
first Chaparral of this year is due
Wednesday, and will be sold on Quad
for the disgustingly low price of 30
cents."
"Glad to hear it," we began—but
he was already off, hopping merrily
across the Quad, using his hammer
for a pogo stick.

"Winstead Weaver?" we inquired.

the 'Doily,' jumping in the Union

"Tell me just one thing," we said.
"How did you ever find time to put
out a magazine?"

he said, "but wo always come

for the disgustingly low price of 30
cents."
"Glad to hear it," we began—but
he was already off, hopping merrily
across the Quad, using his hammer
for a pogo stick.

A small silver hammer tapped us gently on the shoulder the
other day, and a cheerful voice said, "Remember me?"
"Of course we remember you," we said, turning and speaking to
the familiar figure in the red jester's outfit. "You are the Creaking
One, the hammer-wielder, the Old Boy, the Stanford Chaparral

itself, and you have just turned fifty

"I see," he chortled, "you want
reminiscences from the Ancient Rep

when enrollment was so small the
Chaparral could afford to give all

"An old, battered plug hat that

Stanford when the junior plug was

in protest for years afterward."

"And chivalry," we said. "Are you

Chaparral, Volume One, No. One, we

J this:
"He: Troffler is a queer fellow.
