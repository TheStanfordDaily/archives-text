# Folk Arts Called Source Of World Understanding
## Mrs. Lidster Demonstrates Progress Of Dance in Tuesday Series Lecture 
### 
"Exploration of the folk arts will bring a more complete under
standing between all nations and all peoples," declared Mrs. Mir
iam Lidster last night in her lecture-demonstration on folk-dancing.
In presenting an over-all picture of the dance, Mrs. Lidster
showed that all patterns, styles, and figures developed in the first

few decades of primitive times.
"Although the motives behind the
dances have changcd, the patterns
have remained essentially the
same."
Mrs. Lidster stressed the fact that
folk-dancing is again coming into
its own after 10,000 years of being
overshadowed by other forms of
the dance.
Now theaters are reaching out
into the realm of folk - dancing.
Many of today's popular plays, such
as ' Oklahoma," are based on folk
material. The popular dances of the
lf)2o's, like the Charleston and the
Black Bottom, go back to the
"whirling dervish" type of primi
tive dance. Even the fox-trot is
based on a primitive animal dance.
Mrs. Lidster piontcd out that
originally man danced as a means
of communication. The dance was
a greeting, an indication of fear, an
expression of religious feeling.
The use of "singing games" in
many religious communities where
dancing is prohibited can be traced
to the time when dancing was
banned by the Roman Church. Also,
the aphorism that "dancing is the
work of the devil" is literally true,
for the only person who danced
during the Middle Ages was the
"devil" in the mystery plays.
Mrs. Lidster showed the changing
motives behind the dances. She
motives behind the dances. She
gave as examples the "serpentine,"
which is now used at football ral
lies but which had its origin in
a primitive folk dance denoting
brotherhood. The Bavarian Schuh
platter, which has now evolved into
a couple dance, was originally a
fertility dance in which the men
wore animal masks in imitation of
cock fighting.
