# Tibet Yields To China Reds

### 
HONG KONG, Oct. 25 (UP)—
The remote little theocracy of
Tibet, on the roof of the Hima
layan Mountains, has decided to
surrender to the Chinese Com
munists and will start negotia
tions soon in hope of keeping as
much of its prized autonomy as
possible, dispatches said to
night.
A press dispatch from Peking, the
Communist capital, said that the men
who rule Tibet for the 'teen-age
"Living Buddha" had agreed to send
a delegation there at once "to nego
tiate a basis upon which Tibet will
accept Chinese Communist sover
eignty."
The negotiations will be conducted
within the framework of proposals
which the Communist government
sent to Lhasa three days ago—before
the Peking announcement that a
powerful Red army had been or
dered to invade the country—the dis
patch said.
(A United Press London dispatch
said that advices indicated the Ti
betan government had abandoned
hope of successful resistance to the
Reds and would seek only to get the
best terms it could. Private telegrams
received in London from Takdhag
Pandit Hothoktu, the regent who
rules for the boy Buddha, indicated
that he felt Tibet had been deserted
by the Western Powers, the dispatch
said. Takdhag months ago appealed
for Western support to keep out the
Reds.)
Tonight, the Peking Dispatch—re
ceived by the Hong Kong leftist
newspaper Takungpao — said that
after receipt of the Communist pro
posals the Tibetan government had
ordered a delegation to proceed to
Peking at once.
