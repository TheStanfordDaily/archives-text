# Play Well in Hand As Marines Land
## 
### MAGGIE BERNT 
The Marines landed in the Little Theater of Memorial Hall last
night, and considering the reception they got from the opening
night audience, the situation was well in hand.
The Stanford Players production of "What Price Glory?" intro
duced to Stanford audiences two fighting Marines, Sergeant Quirt

Sand Captain Flagg and their crew of
I Leathernecks in some of the roughest,
j toughest language heard in these
parts in quite a spell.
Bill Oyler, as the Captain, led the
well-cast players through the fast
moving thre*; acts, dominating every
scene he appeared in. Tight-lipped,
hoarse-voiced Sergeant Quirt, played
excellently by Art Levinson, was
perfect foil for him.
Romantic interest as well as the
central point of conflict in the story
was supplied by Rcva Feldman
whose performance as Charmaine
was one of the high spots of the
evening. Her honest portrayal of
the French peasant girl added
greatly to the effect of the play as
did the understanding perform
ances of the supporting cast, head
ed by John Moore. Don Henry,
Jack Perry, and Art Fischer.

Hal Burdick Jr. as a general be-

hind his men (far behind) and Ber
nard Blum berg as a French peasant
were bright spots in the sometimes
somber affair of fighting a war. Ned
Hutchinson as tough but God-fearing
Lipinsky was excellent.
A special word of praise goes to
technical director John Stevens, re
sponsible for the most elaborate sets
seen by Little Theater audiences in
seasons. Equally effective were the
authentic uniforms and equipment,
and the off-stage sound effects, all of
which gave the play a rare air of
realism.
All in all, the Stanford Players
have opened the fall season with a
bang and will have to work hard to
keep the caliber of future produc
tions up to the standard shown by
director Harris 1 "What Pricc
Glory?"
The play will run through Satur
day night.
