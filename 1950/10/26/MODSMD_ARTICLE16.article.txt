# King Weather Hits Farm, S.F.
## 
### 
King Weather turned his spigots
on the PeninsuVx yesterday—long
and hard. All in all, it was one of
the heaviest October rainfalls re
corded in recent years.
San Francisco was the chief target
on the King's list. Between tho hours
of 3 and 4 p.m. yesterday in that city,
.64 inches of rain literally poured
down on the streets.
The .64 inches in one hour repre
sented better than twice as much
rain as Stanford recorded in eight
and one-half hours, and accounted
for more than half the rainfall that
fell in San Francisco all day.
Total rainfall for the day in the big
city (up until 4 p.m.) was .97 inches
—the heaviest downpour since Jan.
21.
Stanford's rainfall was the heaviest
so far this season and easily topped
anything King Weather had to offer
last October. At 4:30 p.m. it meas
ured a dripping .25 inches—and, ac
cording to Assistant Engineer Carl
Meier, "would probably measure an
other .05 inches, at least, during the
night."
As a result of all this steady rain,
Stanford's total precipitation for the
current season was boosted to .48
inches, .12 inches of which fell on
the campus Sunday night and all day
Monday.
In another part of the West Coast,
Los Angeles reported fairly clear
weather.
