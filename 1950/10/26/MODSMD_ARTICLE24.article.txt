# SC Guest Rules Set
## 
### 
Women will be allowed to double
up in their rooms during the SC
weekend, Nov. 3-5, in order to ac
commodate guests for the game fes
tivities.
The decision of how many addi
tional women may be housed in
each residence will rest with the
house mother, according to Pat
Penny, chairman of Women's Coun
cil. The house mother will deter
mine the number of guests who can
safely be accommodated in accord
ance with fire regulations.
Women desiring to double up
may check with their house mother
to see what the policy in their resi
dence will be.
Women's Council alsp issued a
reminder yesterday that women are
allowed to sign out only before
closing hours. Penalty for viola
tion of this rule is lockout minutes
from closing hours until time of
return, plus an offense.
