# Excom Selects Recipients For Charity Drive
## 
### 
Excom revamped its charity drive
schedule last night and named the
Palo Alto Youth Fund, the cancer
fund, foreign relief, and the float
i ing fund as the recipients of the
fall charity drive. In other major
action, the group approved a high
school day at Stanford.
The final decision was a partial
about-face from the original charity
plan, which called for cancer and
foreign relief to share the proceeds
of a winter drive.
Excom learned last night that
j Red Cross regulations, set forth by
their national and international
| charters, prohibit that organization
from lending its name to a drive
which includes other charities or
delegates a subsidiary organization
to administer the drive.
Student body Vice-President Jo
Lyon explained to the group that
these regulations are backcd by
Congress and a Geneva conference,
I and are not pure whims of the Red
Cross.
