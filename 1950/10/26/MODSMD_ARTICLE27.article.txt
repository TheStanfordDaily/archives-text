# Loyalty Oath Petition Leads to Excom Row
## Jonas, Saeta, Close Argue Pros, Cons of Condemning Oath Here 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
A petition by 98 students to have Excom condemn the California
Loyalty Oath or to allow the student body to condemn it was
tabled after sharp debate last night. Gil Jonas, who was several
times called to order by ASSU President Ted Buttner, dissented.
Jonas, who presented the petition, was in favor of a campus-widc

referendum to discover student opin
ion.
Phil Saeta disagreed, arguing thai
a referendum would be unnecessary
expense. If enough of the students
are interested, he said, and five per
cent of the student body sign it, Ex
com is ordered by the ASSU consti
tution to act on the petition or submit
it to referendum. He added after
ward. "We were not elected to dis
cuss issues like this one."
"I beg your pardon, hut I ran on
this issue," Jonas broke in. "and I
probably served 15 hours in the Con
Home for my opinion."
Most of the debate centered around
whether the loyalty oath was a polit
ical issue.
ASSU President Ted Buttner w;<\
afraid outsiders would consider
Stanford "radical" if the petition w;<
signed and requested that the motion
be tabled until he could get the opin
ion of the Administration on the L
sue.
Donald B. Close, an interested stu
dent, argued that "it is clearly a po
litical issue." A referendum would
set a bad precedent, he said. "A ma
jority of students would vote against
the oath and then radical group;
could claim that Stanford University
held communistic views."
"Academic freedom can never be
a partisan issue," Jonas answered
Close. "The right of a man to ex
press himself in a university is
necessary and to tie this up with
the hysteria that is now sweeping
California is not right."
Excom member Carol Penny
sounded a milder note. "Since this
issue does seem to be involved in
California politics," she said, "we
should see if the Administration con
siders this a partisan issue before we
vote."
Chris Keith, Fritjof Thygcson, and
William (Bud) McCord, former
sophomore class president, argued for
the petition. All three felt that Ex
com should not decide for the student
body but should let the students dis
cuss the issue, preferably by a refer
endum.
Keith said that "ilie issue is not
whether the loyalty oath is good oi
bad. but whether wc should discuss
it. I feel that our liberties arc being
quietly kicked downstairs if an issue
like this one passes without disc us -
I sion."
