# We Can Fumble Too
## 
### 
Tor the first time in four years Stanford is on
the verge of defeat —not necessarily on the
gridiron but defeat in the sense of a declining
Stanford Spirit. Broken bones, sprained ankles,
and dislocated knees heal, but spirit is some
thing which can not be taken out of a cast and
injected into a rooting section or a student body
that has lost it.
The team, shaken but still standing with a
lecord of four wins and one off day defeat, will
not lose the spirit after beiny knocked down
once.
The student body in 1547 did not lose the
spirit even after nine straight losses. There was
not a man wearing a red rooting cap who
didn't think for a minute that the Big Red would
lise up and knock down the Bear across the Bay.
We saw a 21 to 18 defeat, a 7 to 6 squeeze,
and a 33 to 14 upset, but they didn't faze Stan
ford. The Daily headline and the Cellar coffee
dririkers said "Maybe Next Year."
This fall the pressure was on coach, team, and
the student body as a whole. Now that we're

well into the football grind, the time has come to
forget about the pre-season dope sheets and
concentrate on each and every game as a sep
arate challenge not only to the Big Red Machine
but to the Stanford Spirit as well.
Undeniably, ou» team and its coach have
faced and will continue to face each challenge
as well as they know how; it shouldn't be too
hard for some students to discard their appar
ent "who cares'' attitude and do the same.
When we were down during those other
years, the spirit was sky-high. Now we're up (or
close to the top) we've started sliding. There's
been a committee formed to help our public
relations with visiting students and teams, Will
this enthusiasm extend to the Stanford Spirit?
Are a partially-salvaged rally, a rooting sec
tion without card stunts, and a Quad full of long
faces all that we have to maintain that "will to
win?"
We're primed for a steady climb. Maybe it
won't be to the Rose Bowl. Maybe not even to
a Big Game triumph. But for the sake of Stan
ford, let's recover that fumbled spirit.
