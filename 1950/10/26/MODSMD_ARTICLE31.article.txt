### LISA THACKER 
Have you ever gotten your Christmas presents in
October when the stores start pushing this "'so many
shopping days until Christmas" routine? And after the
presents have been sitting in your closet for months,
do they ever seem as much fun when you present
them on Christmas morning as the ones you frantically
purchase on the last shopping day?
1 would like to compare getting Big Game dates with
this business of Christmas shopping. At first this may
seem ridiculous, but allow me to develop my point.
Let me depict two minor tragedies that could occur
from this fad of asking for dates for Big Game months
and weeks in advance. It may be all very well to say
you want to be sure of getting a date, but—here's what
might happen.
Case No. 1: Mr. E. Gurr has just met lovely tanned
Miss G. Surr on the island of Catalina and as the palm
trees whisper in the soft summer night's breeze, he
whispers in her ear: "How about a date for Big Game?"
She giggles with excitement then demurely answers,
"Oh, all right, I guess so."
Fine! Everything is set. But as the sun tans fade
and Mr. Not-So-E. Gurr now, begins to realize that
Miss A-Little-Too Surr is not the girl for him, he
dreads even the thought of spending one cent on Big

Game weekend. What can he do? NOTHING! He's
stuck.
Case No. 2: Miss K. Ute is very pretty. So on the
very first day of school she is swamped with requests
for dates for the Big Game. And, out of necessity
perhaps, she refuses the first week's requests since
the person she likes best at this point hasn't asked
her. But on the second week no one asks her, nor on
the third, or the fourth, or the fifth and so on until,
by the week before the BIG Game, she becomes panic
stricken. "What has happened?" she wails. This is it!
Everyone thought she was so popular and pretty
that after the first week there was no point in asking
for a date since she undoubtedly had one by that
time. And no one called on the week before the B.G.
for they figured if she didn't have a date by then there
must be something mighty wrong with her. So much
for the plight of poor Miss K. Ute.
Now suppose everybody waited sanely until the
week or so before Big Game before asking for dates.
Ey then Mr. Gurr could see that the Beauty he had
met in a sun-stroked daze, had faded and he could
ask Miss K. Ute who, by the way, would be so thrilled
to go she would INSIST, untoitured, that the date be
Dutch treat!

this business of Christmas shopping. At first this may
seem ridiculous, but allow me to develop my point.
Let me depict two minor tragedies that could occur
from this fad of asking for dates for Big Game months
and weeks in advance. It may be all very well to say
you want to be sure of getting a date, but—here's what
might happen.
Case No. 1: Mr. E. Gurr has just met lovely tanned
Miss G. Surr on the island of Catalina and as the palm
trees whisper in the soft summer night's breeze, he
whispers in her ear: "How about a date for Big Game?"
She giggles with excitement then demurely answers,
"Oh, all right, I guess so."
Fine! Everything is set. But as the sun tans fade
and Mr. Not-So-E. Gurr now, begins to realize that
Miss A-Little-Too Surr is not the girl for him, he
dreads even the thought of spending one cent on Big

Game weekend. What can he do? NOTHING! He's
stuck.
Case No. 2: Miss K. Ute is very pretty. So on the
very first day of school she is swamped with requests
for dates for the Big Game. And, out of necessity
perhaps, she refuses the first week's requests since
the person she likes best at this point hasn't asked
her. But on the second week no one asks her, nor on
the third, or the fourth, or the fifth and so on until,
by the week before the BIG Game, she becomes panic
stricken. "What has happened?" she wails. This is it!
Everyone thought she was so popular and pretty
that after the first week there was no point in asking
for a date since she undoubtedly had one by that
time. And no one called on the week before the B.G.
for they figured if she didn't have a date by then there
must be something mighty wrong with her. So much
for the plight of poor Miss K. Ute.
Now suppose everybody waited sanely until the
week or so before Big Game before asking for dates.
Ey then Mr. Gurr could see that the Beauty he had
met in a sun-stroked daze, had faded and he could
ask Miss K. Ute who, by the way, would be so thrilled
to go she would INSIST, untoitured, that the date be
Dutch treat!
Have you ever gotten your Christmas presents in
October when the stores start pushing this "'so many
shopping days until Christmas" routine? And after the
presents have been sitting in your closet for months,
do they ever seem as much fun when you present
them on Christmas morning as the ones you frantically
purchase on the last shopping day?
1 would like to compare getting Big Game dates with
this business of Christmas shopping. At first this may
seem ridiculous, but allow me to develop my point.
