# CAMPUS OPINION
## Defense of Cal Oath 
### 
To the Editor:
There appeared in the "Stanford Daily" a very dan
pejous "Campus Opinion" which was filled with im
pressive phrases such as "democratic ideals," "in
fringement on rights," "academic freedom," and "free
expression oi ideas." Needless to say, the author was
in favor of all these!
Specifically, I refer to an article by Gil Jonas con
cerning the "loyalty oath" at Cal.
According to Mr. Jonas the educational system of
the country is in dire peril because the Board of Re
gents at the University of California had the foresight
and wisdom to demand that the professors at their
institution do not indoctrinate their students with
pteudo and dangerous philosophies of "anti-Ameri
canism" and "hail comrade Joe-ism."
At one point in his very well-written article, Mr.
Jonas intimated that this oath hindered the pursuit
of knowledge. Nothing could be further from the pur
pose of effect of this oath. In what way does this oath
keep anyone, who has professed to be a non-Commu
nist, f#om mixing all the chemicals he wants, extract
inp all the cube roots he can possibly extract, or read
ing all the books he wantsâ€”yea, even the Communist
Manifesto?
At one point, the author states that there is a group
of students, in which he numbers himself, "who," I
quote from his article, "feel that there is nothing more
worthwhile fighting for and maintaining than aca
demic freedom and free expression of ideas." Won
derful! 1 agree!
And certainly everyone must agree that "academic
freedom" and "free expression of ideas" are not ad
vocated in the Communist philosophy; yet, Mr. Jonas
would allow Communists to go right on teaching this
anti-freedom philosophy of their without restraint.
Indeed, those ill-fated and much abused professors
at Cal would have far less freedom 10 years from now
if the principles of former "Red" professors at that
university were not kept out by the prompt and wise
action oi the Board of Regents.
In short, the so-called tyranny imposed by the Cal
Board of Regents is, in the long run, a far "lesser evil"
than that tyranny which would be imposed by Com
munists and their fellow travelers if they were allowed
to continue leaching their tyrannical doctrines of anti
freedom and hate.
Before closing, I would like to say that I agree with
Mr. Jonas concerning the need of Stanford students'
interest in the affairs of other universities, such as
Cal. We at Stanford should be so interested as to ini
tiate a similar oath here at Stanford rather than trying
to tear down the good work done at other schools.
