# Wrong Slant on Review

To the Editor:
The movie "Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a great
comedy and a tender tragedy. For the sake of justice
let not the movie, but its review in the Daily, be called
"shallow entertainment." To Stanford movie critics
George Buckley and Roy Hemming -the element of
t message in "Kind Hearts and Coronets," which

helps make it a threat movie, is much the some as
Charlie Chaplin's "Monsieur Verdoux."
But you missed it; the plot is the individual's chal
lenge of the authorities' sole moral right over life and
death. This is the tragic madness of Raskolnikov in
so "shallow" a masterpiece as "Crime and Punish
ment.' Arid this is the message of Alec Guiness in
"Kind Hearts and Coronets."
lie is convinced the dukedom is rightfully his, and
challenges the sole right of the authorities over life
and death by liquidating his relatives.
Fine comedy there is, too, but Messrs. Buckley and
Hemming failed to describe it, possibly because they
didn't know what it was. Killing in American films,
in keeping with the pragmatic culture, is always por
trayed as a means to an end. t The British film "Kind
Hearts and Coronets," what with a dozen murders and
all the paraphernalia of a Dick Tracy ccmic strip, has
a great time spoofing such a poor melodramatic theme.
But our Daily critics, reared in the American film
tradition of murder-with-a-purpose, see their cus
tomary serious theme laughed at, can't see what's so
iunny about it and eventually decide the movie is
"shallow entertainment" because the murders serve
no purpose, merely entertainment. Gentlemen, the
entertainment, comedy, and jokes are on you!
