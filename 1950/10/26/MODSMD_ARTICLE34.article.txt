# Toynbee Misunderstood
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I believe it would be a serious mistake to allow
Cynlhia TroxelPs letter of yesterday morning to go
unanswered. Though Toynbee never made his views
explicit, it is obvious that her interpretation danger
ously distorts Toynbee's emphasis. There is good rea
son to believe, especially in the light of his other
statements, that he was not familiar with the specific
Atlantic Union proposal Cynthia had in mind when
she received his apparent endorsement.
Toynbee's basic thesis was that we must "uproot
national sovereignty" and "band together for world
government." The great question is to which pole will
the people of the world gravitate—the West or the
East.
We must orient ourselves to the rest of the world
and consider their needs and how our actions appear
to them, rather than forcing them into the arms of
Russia. He added, "I believe that a union around the
United States cannot be . . . healthy . . . unless we
face this problem of creating some type of common
federal government for the Western community as a
whole." RICHARD O'CONNELL
