# OPINION POLL
## Reds Lead War of Words In Asia, Stanfordites Think 
### 
Russia is winning the propa
ganda war in Asia, while the
United States still holds the
moral lead in Europe, said the
majority of foreign and Ameri
can students at Stanford, inter
viewed last week by a survey
committee of the Institute of In
ternational Relations.
Reiko Ishakawa, ASSU scholarship
student from Japan, added that
counter-attack by propaganda, and
not by direct suppression of Com
munist uprisings is our # only hope
against Communism in the Far East.
Direct action outside the UN would
generate greater danger among the
Japanese who are depending for
guidance on the American model of
democracy.
Miss Ishakawa was among the two
student groups, foreign and Ameri
can, questioned in the first of peri
odic polls conducted by the lIR to
t/auge trends in student opinion on
current world issues.
In response to the question, "Do
you think the UN wiil in time prove
an effective and enduring organ of
world peace?" three-fourths of both
groups answered favorably.
Whether or not the United States
should take direct action to suppress
Communist uprisings was the only
question to put a real gap between
foreign and American student opin
ion. Like Reiko Ishakawa, G4 per

cent of the foreign students said no;
less than 40 per cent of the Ameri
cans asked were opposed.
Germany *is considered a more
serious friction point than any coun
try of the Far East, according to the
consensus. Thirty-eight per cent of
the Americans and 50 per cent of the
foreign students questioned consid
ered Germany the most probable
starting point for a third world war.
