# Cardinals Outline New Board Rules
## 
### 
Cardinals Tuesday night outlined
regulations for the use of the bulle
tin boards at History and Engineer- *
ing corners.
Wayne Williams, in charge of the
boards, presented rules designed to
keep them neat and up to date.
The use of 3x5 or 4x6 cards has
been specified. All notices must be |
dated and cannot remain posted for j
longer than two weeks unless re- i
newed. Cards may be renewed by
redating. Nothing may be posted
on the frames except along the bot
tom border.
"Cardinals has assumed the re
sponsibility of the two boards and
we will see that all notices not
complying with the rules are torn
down," Williams said.

ciate professor of history, will speak
