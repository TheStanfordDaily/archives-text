# Band Stunt Ribs Army
## 
### 
The Harvard sense of humor was
well protected from the blow suf
fered by its football team in last
week's game with Army.
"Substitutions Unlimited." a par
ody on the two - platoon football
system, was performed by the Har- j
vard band. The stunt took two
years' preparation, according to the
Harvard Crimson.
An offensive and defensive band, I
each composed of 75 men and 35
substitutes, trotted on and off the
field in an attempt to out-platoon
the Army football team.
Ine Harvard band had free rein
during half-time, since Army can
celed plans to send its band, as 1
well as the whole Cadet Corps, to
the game.
