# Card-Washington Rivalry Marked by Farm Shutouts
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
The Washington Huskies, huskier
this year than usual, ride herd into
Stanford Sadium Saturday to meet
a "do or die" Cardinal eleven. The
game will mark the twenty-seventh
renewal of the Stanford-Washing
ton rivalry.
The Indians, who left their weap
ons home when the invaded the
Bruin lair, must scalp the Husky or
see a dimming Rose Bowl flame die
out completely.
The last two years have seen the
Big Red Machine roll over helpless
Washington clubs.
Flying to the land of the big
trees and the wet earth last year,
the Indians swept the Huskies
completely off their home field,
40 to 0. This marked the tenth
contest in which the Huskies have
been held scoreless.
When Washington came to Palo
Alto in 1948, the Cards made the
welcome mat from Husky pelts.
Paced by Bill DeYoung's lightning
GO-yard touchdown sprint up the
center of the field, the Injuns
lacked up another shutout, this
time 20 to 0.
Stanford, traveling to Seattle in
1947, hacl the door slammed in its
face, and returned to the reserva
tion with a 25 to 0 set-back.
Washington was forced to come
from behind in 194G to beat a Lloyd
Merriman and Bob Anderson - led

Card squad, 13 to 7.
Before the Indians called it
quits for the war period, Stanford
measured Washington 13 to 7 in
1941 and 20 to 7 in 1942. Most of
j the work was done by leftovers
from the '40 Bowl squad.
The '42 triumph is notable be
cause of the game's location. The
contest, originally scheduled for
Palo Alto, was switched to Kezar
Stadium in the heart of Golden
Gate Park in San Francisco. War
time gas rationing made Peninsula
! attendance drop, therefore necessi
; ta f ing the change.
On?! of the most important
games ever played in the series
was the memorable game of 1940.
With the Rose Bowl bid in the
balance, an undefeated Washing
ton team came to town to meet
the undefeated Albert and Co.
Wow Boys.
The Indians, getting off to a slow
start, trailed at the intermission 10
to 0; but coming back strongly in
the second half, the Cards scored
: three times to win 20 to 10 and
earn an invitation to the Pasadena
I affair.
The series started in 1893. Stan
ford's second year of football com
petition. The Cards chalked up a
i 40 to 0 win. The next meeting was
in 1920 when Dink Templeton
kicked a 25-yard field goal to give
Stanford a 3 to 0 win.
