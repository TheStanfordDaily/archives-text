# Track Squad Put Through Fall Training
## 
### 
A trackless track team and the
problem of replacing several key
men from the, 1949 aggregation con
front Coach Jack Weiershauser as
he puts his charges through their
paces in the fall practice session.
Gone from the team that placed
second in the NCAA meet are such
standouts* as Otis Chandler, Gay
Bryan, and Bud He'd. To replace
them, however. Coach Weiershau
ser has several promising prospects
from last year's freshman team.
Bob Mathias, Tulare Olympic
champion who is up from the frosh,
will give up the decathlon this year
to concentrate on the shot put, dis
cus, and high hurdles. Bob Simon,
miler; Norman Jiles, high jumper;
Duke Johnson, pole vaulter; and
Chuck Renfro, discus, are some of
the other sophomores.
Reed from Australia
From Australia comes lan Reed,
British Commonwealth champion in
the discus with a 158-foot throw.
Lew Davis, veteran of last year's
team, is a good bet for the shot put
tit?e in the NCAA this year.
Bob Bryan, who placed second in
the low hurdles in the nationals,
will be out to better that record. In
the combination of Bryan, Ronnie
Buck, Bill Storum, and Wilbur Tay
lor the Indians should again have
one of the top 440 relay teams.
Old campaigners like Merritt Van
Sant, who has done 24 feet in the
broad jump, Darrell Kreitz, who
has navigated the high hurdles in
14.3 seconds, and Buck, a 9.7-sec
ond sprinter in the hundred, will
give the Cards a well - rounded
team.
Track Resurfaced
At the present time the track is
being resurfaced so Coach Weiers
hauser has had little opportunity to
evaluate the performances of the
individual members, especially the
new ones. However, he has a great
er number of men to work with
than ever before and is optimistic
about his team's chances.
