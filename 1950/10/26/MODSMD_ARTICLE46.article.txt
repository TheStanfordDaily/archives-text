LOS ANGELES. Oct. 25 (UP) â€”
Washington's Huskies lead the Pa
cific Coast Conference in offense
while Stanford leads in defense at
the halfway point of the 1950 foot
ball season, the Conference Com
missioner's office disclosed tonight.
Team statistics, which excluded
the Washington-Illinois game, show
the Huskies have run up 1,(574 yards
in four games for an average of
418 yards per game.
Washington also led the confer
ence in passing, chiefly due to the
work of quarterback Don Heinrich.
