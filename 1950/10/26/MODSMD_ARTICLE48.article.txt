## Report From Seattle Spotter Tells of Husky Determination 
### BOB SPIELMANN 
With permission from Marchie
Schwartz we're quoting excerpts
from a letter written by a Stanford
grad who has been scouting Wash
ington these past few weeks. As
you will see, this gent knows the
Huskies like McColl knows his
pigskin.
"This will be no ordinary foot
ball game. There is no school in
the country that Washington wants
to beat more than Stanford. Just
plainly, 'they want to knock you
fellows' teeth down your throats.'
'♦They will try to win at all
costs and will try to give you the
most miserable afternoon in the
Indians' football history. Up here
in Seattle you hear just one thing
—Beat Stanford!
"After last year's 40 to 0 Stanford
victory they will be out to anni
hilate you.
"This will be no 40- or 50-minute
ball game. It will be 60 minutes
going full steam all the way. They
are pointing for you like no school
evet- pointed for a football game
before.
"If each and every Card will
just go into that game with the
feeling that every fellow on that
Washington team wants to give
you the real business, and treat
them accordingly, you can't lose.

"Washington is an explosive team.
You can't relax for a second or they
are gone. They must be constantly
beaten down and beaten down
again.
"In other words, fellows, they
just plain don't care for Stanford.
"If I could only get across to
you the feeling that exists up
he-re, you would get so damn mad
there would be no containing you.
"You can't prepare mentally for
the game on Friday afternoon or
Saturday morning. You must start
Monday and keep going till you hit
a peak Saturday. Football is only
fun when you win, but you have
to be mentally ready to beat a
strong football team, and that's just
what Washington is."
