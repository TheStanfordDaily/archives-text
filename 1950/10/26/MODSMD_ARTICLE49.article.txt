# Bravesâ€™ Schedule Bare Until Nov. 18
## 
### 
Stanford's Braves, resting on the
laurels of a three - game winning
streak, do not return to the gridiron
wars until Nov. 18 when they meet
the Presidio of San Francisco squad
in a prelim to the Army - Stanford
game.
The junior varsity has been hard
at it, however. In addition to prac
ticing for their coming tilt, the
Braves have been testing varsity de
fenses with the plays of coming op
ponents.
Following the Presidio game, the
Braves tangle with the always rug
ged California Ramblers on Big
Game Day, Nov. 25.
