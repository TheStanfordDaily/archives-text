# Have Changed, But Spirit Of Red Barn Is Revived
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
Senator Leland Stanford would
never recognize his 64 acres of stock
farm. The old corral is still down
on the Farm, but there the resem
blance to '76 ends.
The Red Barn stil! houses horses,
but not the champion racers and
trotters in the country as it did in
yesteryear. In the Senator's clay, a
horse had to have a speed record
before he was entitled to room and
board in the Red Barn.
Eighty Employees
It would be lonesome for the
Senator and one of his old horses
today. Long ago, the stock farm had
more than 75 horses in training
daily, over 20 stallions, and 300
mares. Eighty men wtfre employed,
not counting blacksmiths, Chinese
laborers, harness - makers, and
ranch hands. The land was dotted
with training corrals, jumping bar
riers, sawdust-filled arenas, and a
"colt kindergarten" where yearlings
were trained to a harness and run
to develop speed.
Senator Stanford had a keen in
terest in horses, especially in racers.
He purchased the territory espe
cially for breeding and training fast
horses, long before the town of
Palo Alto emerged on the Penin
sula. The Senator had his own sci
entific ideas on breeding and be
came well known in racing circles
through his work and articles.
Muybridge Photos
Few landmarks of the original
Stanford Farm remain. The Red
Barn, one of the oldest buildings on
campus, is only one of the four
original barns. It was in the loft of
the Red Barn that the famous
Muybridge photographs were first
shown, an event which produced an
effect similar to today's movies.
These photos were made because
of Senator Stanford's curiosity
about the position of a horse's legs
in action. He maintained that all
four legs of a galloping horse are
off the ground at the same time.
A battery of 24 cameras with
electro-shutters were arranged to
take continuous exposures of a gal
loping horse. The Senator proved

his point, at the same time aiding |
in the development of the motion j
picture. A plaque now commemo- I
rates the exact spot of the experi
ment.
Horse Cemetery
Another of the old barns, a brick i
one, that once housed work horses
and was nicknamed "The Ship," is |
now used as a tool shed. A statue i
of Sherwood, on,e of Senator Stan- !
ford's horses, marks the area of the
old horse cemetery. Only the best
horses were laid to rest there, each
grave marked with a plaque telling ,
the name, record, and birth and
death dates of the particular horse.
In 1946 riding was revived on the
Farm when the Red Barn was
painted and remodeled to double
its capacity. This was mainly due '

|to the efforts of Dr. Donald B.
! Tresiddcr and friends' who donated
| money. The previous riding estab
i lishment was under ROTC manage
j ment and was discontinued at the
; coming of the war.
Riding Courses
Under the management of Mr.
and Mrs. Allan Ross, the Red Barn
is now headquarters for a regular
gym course in riding. Horses are
also rented to the polo team, stu-
J dents, and faculty. About 75 stu
j dents take the riding course every
; quarter. This consists of two two
hour periods a week. English and
Western on three skill levels, plus
| polo and jumping, are offered. The
barn houses 35 school horses and
' boards 30 others.

looks the pastures (now the golf course) of the Stanford Stock
Farm.
