# 'Salt to the Devil’ Realistic, But Dulled by Weight of Ideas
## 
### GEORGE BUCKLEY 
The story of a young Italian family
struggling to free itself from the cold
machinery of a large and impersonal
American city — namely, New York

City —is grimly
told in "Salt to
the Devil," now
playing at the
Vogue in San
Francisco.
As adapted
from the novel
l _J:

"Christ in Concrete" by Pietro di
Donato. it is a very realistic film,
but perhaps a little too heavily
done. The story, as filmed, is dulled
by the weight of its idea.
Acting Lacks Depth
The situation it portrays is cer
tainly very believable, but the
manner in which it is presented on
the screen is one-dimensional. The
chief reason for this is the lack of
depth in almost all of the character
izations. Too little is shown of these
people for them to be really con
vincing. They lack subtlety and
completeness.
The actors, therefore, are forced
to express but a part of the human

being inherent in their roles. They
Seem to act them out and not to
make them live. Sam Wanamaker,
in the lead role, especially lacks
feeling. #
The rest of the cast is little more
than adequate, except for Lea Pa
do van i who, by contrast, is magnifi
cent as the wife. She conveys the
feeling as well as the appearance of
her role.
Situations Artificial
Furthermore, despite the realistic
approach of director Edward Dmyr
ryk, much of the film's situation
seems contrived, as, for example,
the arrangement — so artificial —by
which the family has to wait for its
long-cherished home.
Nevertheless, these weaknesses,
although important, do not destroy
the film's value. "Salt to the Devil"
brings to the screen a thoroughly
worthwhile subject matter. The
over-all effect of its theme is very
powerful, forcing its audience to
think about the ruthless oppression
of those many people who come
hopefully to the "land of freedom"
fiut who still arc not free.
