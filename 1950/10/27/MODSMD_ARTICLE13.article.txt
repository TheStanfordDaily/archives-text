THIS FRANKENSTEIN-LIKE duo have been spooking around
campus recently in order to publicize the '52--'54 get-together
which will be held tonight from 8:30 to 12 in the Women's Gym.
Here they're trying to push George Denny off Hoover Tower.
Spook movies and hoiror-type acts have been planned for the
jamboree. â€”Daily photo by Don Dapelo
