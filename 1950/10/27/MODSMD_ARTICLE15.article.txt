# Record Winds Blast S.F.; Storm Drenches Campus
## 
### 
Windows rattled, doors slammed, lights went out, roofs leaked,
and even the Marchie-men stayed inside yesterday, but Stanford
was lucky. At least the Hoover Tower was still in one piece.
Not so lucky was another educational institution situated some
<5 miles away on the other side of the Bay from the Farm. Yester-

day's storm blew a 100-pound slab of
marble off the University of Cali
fornia's historic Campanile.
Meanwhile, San Francisco was hit
by the highest winds on record. The
gale hit a velocity of 42 miles per
hour, exceeding by two miles the pre
vious recorded high of Oct. 9, 1926.
A quarter of an inch of rain fell in
10 minutes in the City as plate glass
windows were smashed and televi
sion aerials were blown down.
Urgent Calls
At Stanford, scores of phone calls
reporting damage and inconvenience
were received by the Corporation
Yard and Police Department.
Campus policc were summoned to
the BOTC barracks at the height of
the storm when a falling tree dis
lodged a live wire which sparked and
sputtered in the rain. Guards were
posted and the roads blocked off. No
injuries were reported.

Falling trees also blockcd Salva
tierra street and the entrance to the
Con Home, but police officers re
moved the obstructions before any
serious traffic problem occurred.
Corporation Yard workers were
called to sandbag manholes cover
ing the steam pipes around the Me
morial Auditorium when water
threatened to seep into the pipes.
Extensive Damage
Numerous leaky roofs and base
ments were reported. The Health
Service called to say that water was
bubbling up through its floors. Wa
ter leaked into the basement of the
Law Building, and tiles blew off its
roof. Rain dripped into top-floor
rooms in Toyon when the wind blew
oil the tin cover of a skylight.
Students seeking refuge in the
shelter of the Bookstore discovered
water seeping through so-called
scaled windows on three sides of the
building.
Corporation Yard officials took a
long enough rest from their hectic day
to offer a few campus weather sta
tistics: .36 inches of rain fell be
tween 4 p.m. Wednesday and 8 a.m.
yesterday morning. From 8 until 4
yesterday another .55 inches
drenched the campus, making a 24-
hour total of .511 inches.
Jump In Statistics
So far this year, Stanford has re
ceived 1.59 inches as compared to .4
inches for the same period last year.
Most humorous call of the busy
afternoon came from the Philosophy
Dcpai tment on Inner Qund asking for
a worker to rearrange the pots and
pans in the departments attic to
catch falling lain drops. The yard
was unable to send a man.

threatened to seep into the pipes.
Extensive Damage
Numerous leaky roofs and base
ments were reported. The Health
Service called to say that water was
bubbling up through its floors. Wa
ter leaked into the basement of the
Law Building, and tiles blew off its
roof. Rain dripped into top-floor
rooms in Toyon when the wind blew
oil the tin cover of a skylight.
Students seeking refuge in the
shelter of the Bookstore discovered
water seeping through so-called
scaled windows on three sides of the
building.
Corporation Yard officials took a
long enough rest from their hectic day
to offer a few campus weather sta
tistics: .36 inches of rain fell be
tween 4 p.m. Wednesday and 8 a.m.
yesterday morning. From 8 until 4
yesterday another .55 inches
drenched the campus, making a 24-
hour total of .511 inches.
Jump In Statistics
So far this year, Stanford has re
ceived 1.59 inches as compared to .4
inches for the same period last year.
Most humorous call of the busy
afternoon came from the Philosophy
Dcpai tment on Inner Qund asking for
a worker to rearrange the pots and
pans in the departments attic to
catch falling lain drops. The yard
was unable to send a man.
Windows rattled, doors slammed, lights went out, roofs leaked,
and even the Marchie-men stayed inside yesterday, but Stanford
was lucky. At least the Hoover Tower was still in one piece.
Not so lucky was another educational institution situated some
<5 miles away on the other side of the Bay from the Farm. Yester-

day's storm blew a 100-pound slab of
marble off the University of Cali
fornia's historic Campanile.
Meanwhile, San Francisco was hit
by the highest winds on record. The
gale hit a velocity of 42 miles per
hour, exceeding by two miles the pre
vious recorded high of Oct. 9, 1926.
A quarter of an inch of rain fell in
10 minutes in the City as plate glass
windows were smashed and televi
sion aerials were blown down.
Urgent Calls
At Stanford, scores of phone calls
reporting damage and inconvenience
were received by the Corporation
Yard and Police Department.
Campus policc were summoned to
the BOTC barracks at the height of
the storm when a falling tree dis
lodged a live wire which sparked and
sputtered in the rain. Guards were
posted and the roads blocked off. No
injuries were reported.

Falling trees also blockcd Salva
tierra street and the entrance to the
Con Home, but police officers re
moved the obstructions before any
serious traffic problem occurred.
Corporation Yard workers were
called to sandbag manholes cover
ing the steam pipes around the Me
morial Auditorium when water
threatened to seep into the pipes.
