# Stanford, Washington To Battle on Wet Turf
## Passing Game May Be Slow 
### DWIGHT WILBUR Daily Sports Editor 
Washington's once-defeated Hus
kies, the top offensive team of the Pa
cific Coast, and Stanford's once-de
feated Indians, the Coast's top defen
sive eleven, will clash tomorrow in a
PCC "crucial" on the muddy Stanford
Stadium turf. Kickoff time is 2:30.
The Huskies and the Indians, both
high-powered passing teams, will be
definitely slowed down by the wet
weather. The two top quarterbacks
of the Pacific Coast, Don Heinrich of
the Huskies and Gary Kerkorian of
the Indians, may be forced to stick to
the ground instead of showering the
the turf with their accurate tosses.
Coaches Howie Odcll of Wash
ington and Marchic Schwartz, of
Stanford have been plagued with
bad weather all week. Schwartz
managed to get in a short scrim
mage for the Stanfords on Wednes
day, but had to he satisfied with
only a chalk talk yesterday because
of torrential rains.
The Huskies will probably go into
the all-important contest minus the
full-time services of at least three
first stringers. It is unlikely that Jim
Mangan's knee will permit him to sec
much duty at tackle, and the status
of end Bill Peterson and substitute
fullback Dick Sprague is doubtful.
Sprague missed the Illinois game,
which the Huskies lost, 20 to 13, be
cause of a back injury, and Peter
son suffered a dislocated bone in his
left foot against the Illini.
Heading the Stanford injury list
are end Bruce Van Alstyne, tackle
Gordy White, and end Jack Rye, all
of whom are definitely out of tomor
row's crucial.
In addition, halfback Boyd Benson,
who has a severe charlcy horse, end
Bob Scott, who has a bad ankle, and

toward the clouds and wonder if they are going to
be able to stage a rally tonight. —Daily photo by Don Dapelo
halfback Eric Southwood, who has a
pulled leg muscle, are slated for lim
ited action only.
Co-captain Kuss Pomeroy, who
turned in an All-American per
formance against UCLA last Satur
day. will play on defense only in the
game tomorrow because of a
banged-up leg which he received in
the rough Bruin fracas.
Veteran Wes Poulson will start at
offensive right tackle in place of
Pomeroy, and Don Endberg will begin
at offensive right end for Van Al
styne.
Coach Schwartz is undecided as to
whom he will open at the all-impor
tant quarterback spot—Gary Ker
korian, Dick Horn, or Tom Shaw.
Coach Odell will start his ace passer,
Don Heinrich, who has completed 58
out of 98 tries for 84G yards so far
this season.

Despite their first 1950 setback at
the hands of a rough Illinois team
last week, Washington proved itself
able to penetrate the Illini defense
which was the third best in the na
tion. This may give the Indian de
fense something to worry about.
The Huskies ground out 1575
yards rushing and passing against
a team which had yielded but 42X
yards in three previous contests,
one of which was with UCLA.
Heinrich and Hugh McElhenny,
Washington's hard-driving fullback,
completed 12 passes against pre

viously tough Illinois aerial defense.
Unless the turf is too muddy, Stan
ford is expected to employ a wide
open attack. The Washington pass
defense has much room for improve
ment, and the Huskies have yet to
meet a team this season with a top
rate passer.

The Huskies and the Indians, both
high-powered passing teams, will be
definitely slowed down by the wet
weather. The two top quarterbacks
of the Pacific Coast, Don Heinrich of
the Huskies and Gary Kerkorian of
the Indians, may be forced to stick to
the ground instead of showering the
the turf with their accurate tosses.
Coaches Howie Odcll of Wash

bad weather all week. Schwartz

of torrential rains.
The Huskies will probably go into
the all-important contest minus the
full-time services of at least three
first stringers. It is unlikely that Jim
Mangan's knee will permit him to sec

of end Bill Peterson and substitute
fullback Dick Sprague is doubtful.
Sprague missed the Illinois game,
which the Huskies lost, 20 to 13, be

Heading the Stanford injury list
are end Bruce Van Alstyne, tackle

Co-captain Kuss Pomeroy, who
turned in an All-American per

Despite their first 1950 setback at
the hands of a rough Illinois team
last week, Washington proved itself
able to penetrate the Illini defense
which was the third best in the na
tion. This may give the Indian de
fense something to worry about.
The Huskies ground out 1575
yards rushing and passing against
a team which had yielded but 42X
yards in three previous contests,
one of which was with UCLA.

completed 12 passes against pre

viously tough Illinois aerial defense.

ford is expected to employ a wide

defense has much room for improve
