# Stanford, Washington To Battle on Wet Turf
## Passing Game May Be Slow 
### DWIGHT WILBUR Daily Sports Editor 
Washington's once-defeated Hus
kies, the top offensive team of the Pa
cific Coast, and Stanford's once-de
feated Indians, the Coast's top defen
sive eleven, will clash tomorrow in a
PCC "crucial" on the muddy Stanford
Stadium turf. Kickoff time is 2:30.
The Huskies and the Indians, both
high-powered passing teams, will be
definitely slowed down by the wet
weather. The two top quarterbacks
of the Pacific Coast, Don Heinrich of
the Huskies and Gary Kerkorian of
the Indians, may be forced to stick to
the ground instead of showering the
the turf with their accurate tosses.
Coaches Howie Odcll of Wash
ington and Marchic Schwartz, of
Stanford have been plagued with
bad weather all week. Schwartz
managed to get in a short scrim
mage for the Stanfords on Wednes
day, but had to he satisfied with
only a chalk talk yesterday because
of torrential rains.
The Huskies will probably go into
the all-important contest minus the
full-time services of at least three
first stringers. It is unlikely that Jim
Mangan's knee will permit him to sec
much duty at tackle, and the status
of end Bill Peterson and substitute
fullback Dick Sprague is doubtful.
Sprague missed the Illinois game,
which the Huskies lost, 20 to 13, be
cause of a back injury, and Peter
son suffered a dislocated bone in his
left foot against the Illini.
Heading the Stanford injury list
are end Bruce Van Alstyne, tackle
Gordy White, and end Jack Rye, all
of whom are definitely out of tomor
row's crucial.
In addition, halfback Boyd Benson,
who has a severe charlcy horse, end
Bob Scott, who has a bad ankle, and

toward the clouds and wonder if they are going to
be able to stage a rally tonight. —Daily photo by Don Dapelo
