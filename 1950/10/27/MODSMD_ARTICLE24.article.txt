# Rejuvenated Frosh Team Will Meet San Jose State
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford s Papooses, who sal
vaged what otherwise would have
been a completely disastrous week
end against UCLA, by humbling
the Bruinhahes. 34 to 7. romp into
Stanford Stadium to do battle with
the San Jose State Frosh tomor
row. The game will be the 11:30
preliminary for the varsity encoun
ter.
The Cardbabe team that performs
tomorrow should be an entirely dif
ferent crew than the one students
saw against Santa Clara. Stanford
showed they had the potential against
the Broncos, but their timing was
miserably off; they fumbled, they
missed blocks, and were set back by
numerous penalties. Thus, the 14 to
13 loss.
It was a different team that tri
umphed over UCLA last Saturday
—they only fumbled once, their
signal calling was improved, they
passed better and blocked better.
I?i short. Boh (ihilotti's team had
"idled."
San Jose, though they have lost
both starts, aren't any pushovers.
They dropped a 20 to 13 contest to
Santa Clara in the last 40 seconds of
play.
Also, all isn't rosy on the Stanford
side of the ledger. Two very valuable
boys, cud Harry Fancher and full
back Bill Anderson, have divided
that book-l'arnin' is not for them and
'l opped school this week. Fancher is
going to take up agriculture, while

j Anderson heard the call of "Anchor-.
J A weigh," and is going to join the
Navy. Jim W;ird. first string guard
: may miss the game because of ;i l:ad
ankle.
Stanford will probably : tart Hud
Hirschback and John Steinberg at
ends. Marsh Howe and Dick Gant at
tackles, Frank Druhan and Larry
Webster at guards, Dick Steere at
center, Bob Garrett at quarterback,
Ron Cook and Bill Scheidecker at
halves, and Don Day at full.
The offense will center around
the deadly passing of Garrett and
the power running of Cook and
Scheidecker. Cook is rated the best
thing in frosh knickerbockers since
Harry Ilugasian was cavorting for
the frosh.
Ghilotti and assistants Ken Rose,
A 1 Rau, Jim Cactagnoli, and Rock
Campbell have been scrimmaging the
froshers against the varsity this week,
The weather? A new storm is
predicted as coming in from Wash
ington. If that stuff that everyone
talks about hut does nothing about
continues, it may curb Stanford's
passing game. Only tomorrow will
tell how good the Papooses are as
mudders.
May he the team that will put to
gether the most mudpies will win.

Stanford s Papooses, who sal
vaged what otherwise would have
been a completely disastrous week
end against UCLA, by humbling
the Bruinhahes. 34 to 7. romp into
Stanford Stadium to do battle with
the San Jose State Frosh tomor
row. The game will be the 11:30
preliminary for the varsity encoun
ter.
The Cardbabe team that performs
tomorrow should be an entirely dif
ferent crew than the one students
saw against Santa Clara. Stanford
showed they had the potential against
the Broncos, but their timing was
miserably off; they fumbled, they
missed blocks, and were set back by
numerous penalties. Thus, the 14 to
13 loss.
It was a different team that tri
umphed over UCLA last Saturday
—they only fumbled once, their
signal calling was improved, they
passed better and blocked better.
I?i short. Boh (ihilotti's team had
"idled."
San Jose, though they have lost
both starts, aren't any pushovers.
They dropped a 20 to 13 contest to
Santa Clara in the last 40 seconds of
play.
Also, all isn't rosy on the Stanford
side of the ledger. Two very valuable
boys, cud Harry Fancher and full
back Bill Anderson, have divided
that book-l'arnin' is not for them and
'l opped school this week. Fancher is
going to take up agriculture, while

j Anderson heard the call of "Anchor-.

Hirschback and John Steinberg at
ends. Marsh Howe and Dick Gant at
tackles, Frank Druhan and Larry
Webster at guards, Dick Steere at
center, Bob Garrett at quarterback,
Ron Cook and Bill Scheidecker at
halves, and Don Day at full.
The offense will center around
the deadly passing of Garrett and
the power running of Cook and
Scheidecker. Cook is rated the best
thing in frosh knickerbockers since
Harry Ilugasian was cavorting for
the frosh.
