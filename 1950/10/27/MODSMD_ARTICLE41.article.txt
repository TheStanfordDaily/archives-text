### VIC PALMIERI 
1 see where Excorn let the soap box orators get out
ol hand the other night. This campus needs a loyalty
oath like it needs student politicians. Awfully con
siderate of uy to adopt Cal's illegitimate children, I'd

*:ay . . . pretty stupid, too.
What's all this shouting about
academic freedom, anyway? Let's
lace it . . . how free can you get
on someone else's dough? One
quote from that story on the meet
ing interested me, though. The
principal incendiary was heard to
it mark: "I probably served fifteen
hours in trie Con Home for my

opinion ... sounds a little like the guys mother was
s-.-ared Ly the Sacco-Vanzetti case. And I wonder what
he meant by "probably" . . . the kid sounds a little
vague about his past to me. . . .
Anyway, when all this came up, we immediately
held a little referendum of our own among the more
i.olitically aware minds on campus, and the result was
enlightening, to say the least (I bet I can say the least
in the most words of anyone I know).
Our first interview took place at Hustlebut, with
lovely Ncnne Deil, pride of Rally Com.
"Miss Deil," we asked, "what's your opinion on the
controversy in Excom?"
"Well, I iust want to say that if people around here
sp« nt a little less time on Excom and a little more

time on card stunts this campus would he a lot better
off."
Next we encountered big wheel Upping McKnee
putting up another sign across the street in front of
the Union.
"What do you think of Jonas' idea?" we asked.
"If a whale couldn't swallow him, how can I?" was
all wc got out of Upping.
Just then we spotted well known coed Can Nornell.
and a:-ked for her opinion on the loyalty oath.
"I don't approve of swearing! I think the whole
thing is a violation of the Fundamental Standard!"
was her reply.
Last on our list was political science Professor
P( ppington Blowhard.
"Professor," we said, "would you give us your views,
as an authority on this question?"
"Obviously," he replied, "it's a hoax. The consul
ate at Seattle informs me (Ins is all part of a conspir
acy by the Washington Rally Coin to draw our at
tention and interest from Saturday's game. I'm not
worried about academic freedom anyway, but if we
don't win tomorrow, I'll lose my shirt."
All this, I think, points very clearly to the fact that
Drofnats, Inc., have more important things to worry
about than the problems of the Cretan colony across
the Bay.
Down with Calophiles! Down with politics! Down
with this bottle and we'll have another. . . .

Our first interview took place at Hustlebut, with
lovely Ncnne Deil, pride of Rally Com.
"Miss Deil," we asked, "what's your opinion on the
controversy in Excom?"
"Well, I iust want to say that if people around here
sp« nt a little less time on Excom and a little more

time on card stunts this campus would he a lot better
off."
Next we encountered big wheel Upping McKnee
putting up another sign across the street in front of
the Union.
"What do you think of Jonas' idea?" we asked.
"If a whale couldn't swallow him, how can I?" was
all wc got out of Upping.
Just then we spotted well known coed Can Nornell.
and a:-ked for her opinion on the loyalty oath.
"I don't approve of swearing! I think the whole
thing is a violation of the Fundamental Standard!"
was her reply.
Last on our list was political science Professor
P( ppington Blowhard.
"Professor," we said, "would you give us your views,
as an authority on this question?"
"Obviously," he replied, "it's a hoax. The consul
ate at Seattle informs me (Ins is all part of a conspir
acy by the Washington Rally Coin to draw our at
tention and interest from Saturday's game. I'm not
worried about academic freedom anyway, but if we
don't win tomorrow, I'll lose my shirt."
All this, I think, points very clearly to the fact that
Drofnats, Inc., have more important things to worry
about than the problems of the Cretan colony across
the Bay.
Down with Calophiles! Down with politics! Down
with this bottle and we'll have another. . . .

1 see where Excorn let the soap box orators get out
ol hand the other night. This campus needs a loyalty
oath like it needs student politicians. Awfully con
siderate of uy to adopt Cal's illegitimate children, I'd

*:ay . . . pretty stupid, too.
What's all this shouting about
academic freedom, anyway? Let's
lace it . . . how free can you get
on someone else's dough? One
quote from that story on the meet
ing interested me, though. The
principal incendiary was heard to
it mark: "I probably served fifteen
hours in trie Con Home for my

opinion ... sounds a little like the guys mother was
s-.-ared Ly the Sacco-Vanzetti case. And I wonder what
he meant by "probably" . . . the kid sounds a little
vague about his past to me. . . .
Anyway, when all this came up, we immediately
held a little referendum of our own among the more
i.olitically aware minds on campus, and the result was
enlightening, to say the least (I bet I can say the least
in the most words of anyone I know).
