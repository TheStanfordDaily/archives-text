# McElhenny, Heinrich, Seth Will Lead Husky Machine

### POB BERNSTEIN 
A review of the 1950 Washington
roster tells at a glance why Coach
Howie Odell's charges are making
their first spirited bid for the PCC
banner since their failure of 1940.
The invaders from the north were
bolstered this year by not less
than two returning lettermen at
every position. Included among the
26 monogram - winners are sevm
halfbacks, five ends, and five guards
who saw action in 1949.
In addition, Odell has added 21
promising sophomores to his Se
attle gridiron mixture. That the
concoction has proven explosive
can be attested to by Kansas State,
Minnesota. Oregon State, and UC
LA — all blasted by the Odellmen
prior to last week's ill-fated junket
to the Midwest, where the Huskies
lost to Illinois 20 to 13.
Position by position, the invaders
stack up like this:
ENDS: Lots of ends. But there'll
be one less than usual making this
weekend's trip. He's Fritz Apking,
reportedly suspended by Ode!l for
breaking training.
He'll probably be replaced by
Bud Olsen, another letterman who
played halfback last year. Olsen is
6 ft. 2 in. and weighs 193 pounds.
At the other wing will be "Li'l
Joe" Cloidt, this week's candidate
for the "better than Bill McColl"
designation. People up Puget Sound
way are unanimous in tabbing the
184-pound Husky co-captain as the
finest all-around end on the Coast.
TACKLES: A couple of relative
youngsters, football - wise, are the
expected opening choices here.
Louie Yourkowski, 205 pounds and
still growing, is a sophomore who
didn't even make the first frosh
eleven in '49 but has displayed
amazing improvement this season.
The other starter, junior Gene
Norton, is another converted half
back, where he lettered last year.
He's 21, weighs 206.
CENTER: Albanian - born Mike
Michael will open, as he's been do
ing since his sophomore year. He's
a senior now — speedy, a strong
blocker, and a great competitor.
With Cloidt, he captains the Husky
varsity.
GUARDS: J. R. (just call him
by his initials) Savage and Bryan

| Zurek, bot* leltermen, are the of
fensive starters—but both can han
dle defensive assignments if called
upon.
BACKS: The crux of the Indians'
plight. They're known as '"The
Fearsome Foursome," and nobody's
kidding nobody.
Fullback Hugh McElhenny was
All - American JC with Compton's
national champions of two years
ago. He specializes in long break
aways, such as his 97-yard kickoff
return against Minnesota in 1949
and a 91-yard romp against Kansas
State in this year's opener. Hugh,
a 196-pound junior, was averaging
better than eight yard per carry
before running into the Illini last
week.
Currently number four among
j the nation's passers, quarterback
j Don Heinrich makes good use of
I his corps of talented receivers.
The Husky halfbacks, Jack Seth
and Roland Kirby, are both senior
veterans. Both Kirby and his un
derstudy, Bill Earley, are capable
pass receivers, while Kirby and
Seth can both bost of nearly four
yards-per-carry rushing averages.
