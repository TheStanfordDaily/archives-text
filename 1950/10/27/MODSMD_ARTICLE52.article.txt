# "DIGGER" O'DELL
## Coffin Corner 
### 
I think I started something! At least that's what it looks like. Every
one around campus is getting morbid about our "Now Boys."
Well, tor those who saw the celluloid Indians play the celluloid Bruins
Wednesday night b> courtesy of the Cardinals, all is not lost! 0.K.. so
our passing and blocking did stink a little; does that mean that it's going
to be that way for the rest of the season? Does it mean that we can throw
up our hands and say, "Oh well, it was nice while it lasted?" Heck, no,
and the students who saw the lilins (there were surprisingly few) will
probably agree with me.
Sure, the final score was 21 to 7 for the Uclans, but if we look at the slow
motion films of the game, we find that:
1. Our first string defensive line stopped the Bruins cold.
2. Our passers had time to pass, although not as much time as the Bruins
had.
3. Our running plays were definitely clicking. With a few more passes
mixed in, they would have gone further.
4. The plays directly preceding the last UCLA touchdowns were passes
and both came so close to being intercepted by Harry Hugasian and Bob
White, respectively, that it was pitiful.
5. Three very important passes were dropped where Bruce Van Alstyne
would have been if he hadn't been injured.
G. Contrary to Bill Leiser, Chronicle sportswriter, who must have had
dust on his binoculars, Ron Eadie played a great defensive game at left end.
Maybe he wasn't in on all the tackles, but he took mighty good care of the
interference every time they came within shouting distance of him. As I
recall, only two plays went around him, because he forced most of them to
cut in over tackle,
7. Without the aid of Donn Moomaw (or Mawmoo as Marchie kept calling
him at the movies) the Westwood line would very probably have been torn
to shreds in the first quarter.
Add all of these up and you get a different picture of our team, I don't
think I need reiterate concerning Russ Pomeroy and Bob Moore. It's my
opinion that they both played Ail-American ball that game in their re
spective fields and as a result probably cancelled each other out in
regard to the help they gave their teams.
With all of these points I don't mean to imply that we played a good ball
game last Saturday. Our pass defense was still lousy, our blocking was
practically non-existent, and Gawd only knows what happened to our pass
ing. But I'm not trying to build up the team's spirit—Berry made 'em mad,
and it's about time they were getting that gentlemanly polish off—l'm only
trying to keep the stands from being completely empty this Saturday.
Anyway, I'm putting myself out on the twig—Stanford, by 14.

7. Without the aid of Donn Moomaw (or Mawmoo as Marchie kept calling
him at the movies) the Westwood line would very probably have been torn
to shreds in the first quarter.
Add all of these up and you get a different picture of our team, I don't
think I need reiterate concerning Russ Pomeroy and Bob Moore. It's my
opinion that they both played Ail-American ball that game in their re
spective fields and as a result probably cancelled each other out in
regard to the help they gave their teams.
With all of these points I don't mean to imply that we played a good ball
game last Saturday. Our pass defense was still lousy, our blocking was
practically non-existent, and Gawd only knows what happened to our pass
ing. But I'm not trying to build up the team's spirit—Berry made 'em mad,
and it's about time they were getting that gentlemanly polish off—l'm only
trying to keep the stands from being completely empty this Saturday.
Anyway, I'm putting myself out on the twig—Stanford, by 14.
I think I started something! At least that's what it looks like. Every
one around campus is getting morbid about our "Now Boys."
Well, tor those who saw the celluloid Indians play the celluloid Bruins
Wednesday night b> courtesy of the Cardinals, all is not lost! 0.K.. so
our passing and blocking did stink a little; does that mean that it's going
to be that way for the rest of the season? Does it mean that we can throw
up our hands and say, "Oh well, it was nice while it lasted?" Heck, no,
and the students who saw the lilins (there were surprisingly few) will
probably agree with me.
Sure, the final score was 21 to 7 for the Uclans, but if we look at the slow
motion films of the game, we find that:
1. Our first string defensive line stopped the Bruins cold.
2. Our passers had time to pass, although not as much time as the Bruins
had.
3. Our running plays were definitely clicking. With a few more passes
mixed in, they would have gone further.
4. The plays directly preceding the last UCLA touchdowns were passes
and both came so close to being intercepted by Harry Hugasian and Bob
White, respectively, that it was pitiful.
5. Three very important passes were dropped where Bruce Van Alstyne
would have been if he hadn't been injured.
G. Contrary to Bill Leiser, Chronicle sportswriter, who must have had
dust on his binoculars, Ron Eadie played a great defensive game at left end.
Maybe he wasn't in on all the tackles, but he took mighty good care of the
interference every time they came within shouting distance of him. As I
recall, only two plays went around him, because he forced most of them to
cut in over tackle,
