## 
### 
Coach Tom Haynie's water polo
team looks forward to killing two
birds with one stone tomorrow
morning when it tangles with Cal's
invading Berkeley Badmen at 11 in
the Encina Pool.
First: the squad, currently resid
ing in the PCC cellar after drop
ping two contests down south last
weekend, is out to score its first
conference victory. Second: it
wants to administer a first install
ment of revenge for its double de
feat at the hands of the Bears last
year.
After practicing "rain or shine"
this week, Haynie plans no changes
in his starting personnel for the
aquatic version of the Big Game.
Guards will be Ernie Polte, Bob
Frojen, and Erwin Johnson; for
wards, Hub Stokeley, Don Weeden,
and Bob Wycoff; and goalie, Russ
Latelle. ,
The Bears, who managed to win
one of their two games on their
jaunt south, beating UCLA 5 to 3,
will be slight favorites to dunk the
Cards.
The Indian Papooses, currently
working in a three - game win
streak, will tackle the Cal frosh in
a 10 a.m. prelim to the varsity game.
Yesterday the Card frosh shut
out Paly High 5 to 0 for their
third straight victory. Today they
host Sequoia High in an attempt to
make it four.
As added interest, Olympic Games
diving champion Bruce Harlan,

who now coaches freshman swim
ming for Stanford, will give an
exhibition of his diving tomorrow

and varsity contests.
