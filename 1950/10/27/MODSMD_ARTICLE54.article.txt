# Bear soccermen Invade Stanford
## 
### 
California's Golden Bear soccer
men invade Stanford tomoiTow
morning at 10 in an attempt to ex
tend the Indians' current season
win drought to four games.
Although given a fortunate bye
in its crowded schedule last Wed
nesday, the soccer team has been
rained out of all but Tuesday's
practice this week.
In that one day, much concen
trition was given to developing a
co-ordinated offense. Coach Gra
ham also gave his men needed
practice in penalty shots, since
missed penalty shots have cost the
Cards one win and one tie thus far
this year.
Both Cal and Stanford have
dropped close contests to CCSF
and have been soundly defeated by
USF. However, Coatfh Graham be
lieves his men rate a fighting chance
to "beat Cal," if the week's layoff
has not hurt physical condition too
much.
