By hitting 25 right while missing
17 last week the professors are
ahead in the race of prognosis by a
proboscis, having outfoxed The
Daily's wizards by one game. The
faculty leads with 108 correct picks
and 65 misses to the sports' scribes'
107 right and 6G wrong.
All of the crystal gazers missed
the UCLA game by picking the In
dians (we was jinxed), while only
Balch read his cards close enough
to see the Middies were going to
give the Trojans a wooden horse.
All six of the experts were able
to get together on only five correct

picks. They all figured California,
Ohio State, Cornell, SMU, and USF
to win, which they did.
Elward pulled one out of the hat
when he picked Indiana over Notre
Dame, but the whole crew went
on the blink when they chose Ore
gon over St. Mary's. (They must
have thought it was duck weather.)
In the race for individual honors,
master - mind Wilbur retains the
lead with 40 hits and only 16 misses.
Long-shot Berry, in a mad rush to
the wire, now brings up the rear
only nine lengths behind.
