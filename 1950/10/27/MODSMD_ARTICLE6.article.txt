SAN FRANCISCO â€”One of the
most violent storms in years lashed
the Pacific Coast from Washington
to Santa Barbara today.
Throughout Northern California,
trees were uprooted and felled,
power lines were down, communi
cations and shipping were dis
rupted.
In San Francisco, whole areas of
the city were blacked out for min
utes at a time. On the Waldo ap
proach of the Golden Gate Bridge,
the rains loosened huge boulders
and sent them hurtling down on
the highway.
The Weather Bureau said by 11
p.m. that the storm center had
moved up off the Washington state
coast. However, the bureau said a
new storm is forming about 1,209
miles off Vancouver, but it was too
early at that hour to tell when it
would hit California and the North
west.
