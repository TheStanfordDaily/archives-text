# Frosh Paint 'C' as Pact Drawn Up
## 
### 
ASSU President Ted Buttner met
with University of California offi
cials at Berkeley yesterday, and the
representatives formally signed the
annual pledge of non - aggression
between the two schools during the
weeks preceding the Big Game.
But even while the pcace-makers
had been making pians for yester
day's conference, six Encina fresh
men were making plans of a con
trary nature. This carload of frosh
trekked to the Cal campus early
Friday morning and proceeded to
paint the big cement "C" overloik
mg the university a bright red.
Meeting no opposition, the men
calmly signatured their handiwork
with a red "54" at the bottom.
The sextet of painters were
avenging an earlier raid by as
sumed Cal students who burned a
large "C" in the lawn in front of
the Quad a week ago.
The only trouble the frosh en
countered was on the trip home
when they were halted by a Berke
ley policeman for going through a
red traffic light. But when the pa
trolman noticed the painting para
phernalia in the car, and learned of
its use, he only congratulated the
men for their work.
The pact which the Stanford and
California delegates signed yester
day to prohibit any such events in
the future read as follows:
""In order to avoid any occur
rence that might endanger the
friendly relations that have existed
between our universities for so
many years, and in order to
maintain the fine sportsmanship
that has been the tradition of our
"Bvj Game," we, the representa
tives of our student bodies, do
hereby resolve:
"a) That there shall lie no "inva
sions" by the students of ci
ther university of the campus
of the other, and that students
participating in such viola
tions will be subject to severe
discipline.
"b) That each student body will
undertake to educate its mem
bers in the weeks preceding
the "Big Game" to observe the
spirit of the foregoing resolu
tion, and to exercise every
possible measure to prevent
any incident arising that may
lead to its violation."
The document was signed for
California by Pete Goldschmidt,
ASUC president, and Chaffee E.
Hall Jr., assistant dean of students.
Buttner and Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler signed for Stan
ford.
Buttner reminded students that
raids on the Cal campus arc for
bidden by the ASSU constitution,
and "may be punished by expulsion
from the University for the quarter
in which the act occurs, or by other
disciplinary measures."
