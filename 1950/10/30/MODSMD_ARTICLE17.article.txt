# Sakai's Condition Is Still Uncertain
## 
### 
The condition of Roy Sakai is con
siderably improved, according to Dr.
Ralph Tanner, Palo Alto Clinic eye
specialist.
He said it was the most serious eye
injury caused by broken glasses that
he had ever seen, and although Sa
kai's eye is improving, the possibility
of unknown injuries within the eye
makes prediction of the final out
come impossible.
"It is one of those cases where all
we can do is wait," Dr. Tanner said.
