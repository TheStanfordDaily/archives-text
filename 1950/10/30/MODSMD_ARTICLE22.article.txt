PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 29 (UP) —
Flash floods touched off by a four-day
series of gale-driven rainstorms to
night forced thousands of persons to
evacuate their homes in central Ore
gon, isolated a score of communities
and inflicted a mounting toil of dam
age and lives.
Highway travel was virtually
drowned out in Oregon.
At least nine persons were dead
and five missing as the fourth storm
in a week—a. baby compared to the
Earlier ones—lashed the northern
Pacific seaboard.
High winds have buffeted the
coastal area, damaging property,
communications, and shipping, since
Wednesday. Conservative estimates
of the damage rose to $1,500,000. Ore
gon reports said damage to clover and
potato crops was "extremely high."
Storm warnings along the Oregon,
Washington, and north California
coast were hoisted as new low pics
sure areas gathered force over the
ocean.
The storm accounted for a number
of highway accidents which claimed
five lives. Three men drowned and
one wis killed when hit by a wind
felled sapling.
Meanwhile, snow squalls in the
high mountain areas approached
blizzard force.
The U.S. Weather Bureau at San
Francisco issued a special storm
warning, announcing winds of 60
mph were expected from Sacramento
north to the Oregon border and 40
mph south as far as Merced.
Four Air Force men, missing in a
C-47 transport since Thursday, were
feared dead. Planes criss-crossed the
rugged Sierra area without finding
a trace of the plane which was en
route from Ogden, Utah, to McClel
land Field, near Sacramento.
