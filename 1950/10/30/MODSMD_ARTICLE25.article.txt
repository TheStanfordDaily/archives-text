# Heinrich Leads Huskies To 21 to 7 Grid Victory
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Daily Sports Editor
A cool, rifle-armed quarterback named Don Heinrich, the great
est passer in Washington history, literally picked Stanford's weak
aerial defense to pieces as he led his mates to a 21 to 7 win over
Stanford.
Heinrich, in completing 19 out of 24 tosses for 243 yards against

the Indians, broke three all-time
Husky throwing records—most com
pletions in one season, 77; most yard
age gained in one season, 1.0KI); and
most completions in one game, 10.
With superb help from halfback
Roland Kirkby and fullback Hugh
McElhenny, Heinrich thereby set tlv
stage for the Rose Bowl battle to he
held in Seattle Saturday, with the
rampaging Huskies meeting Califor
nia's undefeated Bears.
Scoreless Deadlock
Stanford, with every break in its
favor, put up a great defensive fitjhl
in the first half, and the usually high
scoring Huskies had to be satisfied
with a scoreless deadlock at the end
of the first 30 minutes of play.
However, Coach Howie Odel Is
stalwarts roared back after the inter
mission and scored a TD before tin
stunned Stanfords knew what had hit
them.
Hugh McElhenny, the 200-pound
Husky speedster, took Bob Bryan's
opening second-half kickoff deep in
the end zone and carried the ball back
all the way the Indians' 38.
50 Seconds
After halfback Kirkby had picked
up a quick nine yards, Heinrich
threw a beautiful 31-yard touchdown
pass to end Joe Cloidt, who had
drifted behind Stanford defender Joe
St. Geme. It took only 50 seconds to
produce Washington's initial score.
After a Stanford interception, an
Indian fumble, and a Husky pun>,
quarterback Gary Kerkorian finally
got the Stanford offense rolling
Kerkorian passed to end Hill
Storum for 12 yards to the Washing
ton 44-yard line. Then, quick as a
flash, halfback Bob Bryan ran 37
yards off left guard to the Hu: ky 7,
and one play later fullback Bob
Meyers hit the same spot for an Jn
dian touchdown.
Kerkorian kicked the tying point,
and many of the 36,000 spectator.,
sensed an Indian comeback.
Offense Bogged Down
But after Stanford's spirited de
fensive line had stopped thr Huskies
cold, the Indians' offense bogged
down, and Stanford did not hit pay
dirt again.
The second Husky marker was el
up by the ever-present Kirkby, whn
made a great catch over the nut -
stretched arms of defender Bill Mc-
Coll on the Stanford 4.
Then the Indians put on a hi il -
liant. goal line stand before yielding
Washington's second touchdown.
After three quarterback sneaks had
netted only three yards, Heinrich
handed the ball to halfback Jack


HEINRICH TO EARLEY—Stanford's defensive halfback Bob White, 66, drags Bill Earley, 19, out
of bounds on the Indian 32-yard line after a 15-yard pass play from ace Husky quarterback Don
Heinrich. Marv Tennefoss, Card end, 38, is coming up from the secondary.
Seth, who was hit almost Immediately
by Indian guards Norm Manoogian i
! and Jess Cone.
However, the referee rul£d that the
ball had just crossed the final stripe,
I for a Washington touchdown though
! it appeared from the stands that Seth
J had been stopped.
From that point on, the game was
| all Washington's, and the Huskies
added another touchdown late in the i
| final stanza.
ine tirst half was a case of fumbles,
pnalties, and crucial stops by the In
dians. The Huskies looked like a
powerhouse between the 20-yard
lines, but could not punch across a
iscore.
Inuian defensive ends Ron Eadie,
who replaced Stanford's ailing Jack |
Rye. and Marv Tennefoss turned in
| great performances. They repeatedly

charged in and rushed Heinrich, es
pecially in the scoreless first half,
and olten dumped the Husky ace for
huge losses.
However, both Eadie and Tenne
foss received slight injuries in the
game. Eadie is suffering from a
wrenched ankle, and Tennefoss broke
a small bone in his hand.
With Bruce Van Alstyne and Bob
Scott both recovering from previous
injuries, Stanford has a critical situ
ation at the end position.
Other Indians injured in the game
were Boyd Benson, who is suffering
from a cracked rib. and tackle Dick
Gaedtke, who will have his face
X-rayed for a possible injury.

A cool, rifle-armed quarterback named Don Heinrich, the great
est passer in Washington history, literally picked Stanford's weak
aerial defense to pieces as he led his mates to a 21 to 7 win over
Stanford.
Heinrich, in completing 19 out of 24 tosses for 243 yards against

the Indians, broke three all-time
Husky throwing records—most com
pletions in one season, 77; most yard
age gained in one season, 1.0KI); and
most completions in one game, 10.
With superb help from halfback
Roland Kirkby and fullback Hugh
McElhenny, Heinrich thereby set tlv
stage for the Rose Bowl battle to he
held in Seattle Saturday, with the
rampaging Huskies meeting Califor
nia's undefeated Bears.
Scoreless Deadlock
Stanford, with every break in its
favor, put up a great defensive fitjhl
in the first half, and the usually high
scoring Huskies had to be satisfied
with a scoreless deadlock at the end
of the first 30 minutes of play.
However, Coach Howie Odel Is
stalwarts roared back after the inter
mission and scored a TD before tin
stunned Stanfords knew what had hit
them.
Hugh McElhenny, the 200-pound
Husky speedster, took Bob Bryan's
opening second-half kickoff deep in
the end zone and carried the ball back
all the way the Indians' 38.
50 Seconds
After halfback Kirkby had picked
up a quick nine yards, Heinrich
threw a beautiful 31-yard touchdown
pass to end Joe Cloidt, who had
drifted behind Stanford defender Joe
St. Geme. It took only 50 seconds to
produce Washington's initial score.
After a Stanford interception, an
Indian fumble, and a Husky pun>,
quarterback Gary Kerkorian finally
got the Stanford offense rolling
Kerkorian passed to end Hill
Storum for 12 yards to the Washing
ton 44-yard line. Then, quick as a
flash, halfback Bob Bryan ran 37
yards off left guard to the Hu: ky 7,
and one play later fullback Bob
Meyers hit the same spot for an Jn
dian touchdown.
Kerkorian kicked the tying point,
and many of the 36,000 spectator.,
sensed an Indian comeback.
Offense Bogged Down
But after Stanford's spirited de
fensive line had stopped thr Huskies
cold, the Indians' offense bogged
down, and Stanford did not hit pay
dirt again.
The second Husky marker was el
up by the ever-present Kirkby, whn
made a great catch over the nut -
stretched arms of defender Bill Mc-
Coll on the Stanford 4.
Then the Indians put on a hi il -
liant. goal line stand before yielding
Washington's second touchdown.
After three quarterback sneaks had
netted only three yards, Heinrich
handed the ball to halfback Jack


HEINRICH TO EARLEY—Stanford's defensive halfback Bob White, 66, drags Bill Earley, 19, out
of bounds on the Indian 32-yard line after a 15-yard pass play from ace Husky quarterback Don
Heinrich. Marv Tennefoss, Card end, 38, is coming up from the secondary.

by Indian guards Norm Manoogian i
