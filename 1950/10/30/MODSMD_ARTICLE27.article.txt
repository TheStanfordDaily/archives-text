# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
Yeah, we had another party after the game.
(Stop that infernal racket! What are you doing,
sandblaEting the Hoor? Oh, you're tying your shoes.

Well, don't be so noisy about it!)
Didn't go to the Egg because the
Queen and I doubled with Vic and
lita. Vic had been there Friday
night following the 1947 custom of
celebrating the game a day early.
So we went down to Chez Yvonne.
They put us in the back room with
a bunch of loaded ATOs, who in
sisted on singing (in terrible four
part) "In the Evening By the
Moonlight."

I don't know what I was in the mood for, but I know
what I wasn't in the mood for. (The Queen keeps me
prttty well checked out on that.) It was not "In the
Evening by the Moonlight."
OI course it was better than what we were singing.
Oh yes, we were singing—in a strictly Old Fashioned
way. We were with a gang from the University of
Washington. You probably know them, they were a
bunch ol turn-tail Stanfordites: Bartow Fite, Annie
London, and Chuck Donahoe, etc. They were sing
ing "Heaven Help the Foes of Washington, they're
trembling at the feet of mighty Washington . .
It was peachy-keen.
Annie was in rare form last night. She was wear
ing a purple dress (very Washingtonish) and Hexing
her muscles like a Huskie hound-dawg. My, thesfe.
Washington gurls have muscles. Great shades of the
Daily's cartoon. Kept knocking my drink over. Which
was doubly unfortunate because I didn't have enough
gold for replacements.
Yeah, I went and did it. I bet on Stanford. Friday
night, after a somewhat roaring Daily party (Reb led
us in the Axe Yell, and I went around telling all the

little female tryoutees that Addison was really Vic
Palrnieri), Denny Tuffanelli gave me Stanford and
1/1000 of a point and 1 jumped at it.
(Heaven help the foes of Washington . . .)
Had some long talks with the Washington fellas
about their splendid football team. One of the backs
hates football (who doesn't) but can't quit. He's got a
wife and two kids to support. Jim Castle, the son of
the athletic director, told me that McElhenny did not
get paid and was earning—all by hisself— a high C
plus grade average. I told him I could match that and
that I didn't even play ball at the U.
Vic decided to head for home about oneish (Tita
wasn't paying her share), and he very graciously
loaned the Queen and I his auto. We went back to
the Egg where Annie was still singing, accompanied
by a flock of Stanfordites. She was still flexing.
Then they started singing an unkind version of
"Irene, Good Night." I still wasn't in the mood, so
we went home. The Queen wasn't in the mood either.
Swell evening.
By the way, from where I was sitting during the
game, the most hated man on the field was neither
Heinrich nor Kirby. It was one of the Stanford junior
football managers who insisted on walking around
with his hands in his pockets and talking to the other
people on the field while the band was playing the
Star Spangled Banner. Looked really swell. Hey,
George, how about shaping those guys up.
It was a good game, in spite of the Berkeley-like
Scotch Tissue-tossers, and again it was up to Palmieri
to come up with the choice comment. (This will ruin
his Tuesday's column, but why should you have to
wait 'til every other day for something priceless?)
"As Gertrude Stein once wrote, 'A bowl, is a bowl, is
a bowl'...
Pass the aspirin and "Heaven help the foes of Wash
ington . . ."

Annie was in rare form last night. She was wear
ing a purple dress (very Washingtonish) and Hexing
her muscles like a Huskie hound-dawg. My, thesfe.
Washington gurls have muscles. Great shades of the
Daily's cartoon. Kept knocking my drink over. Which
was doubly unfortunate because I didn't have enough
gold for replacements.
Yeah, I went and did it. I bet on Stanford. Friday
night, after a somewhat roaring Daily party (Reb led
us in the Axe Yell, and I went around telling all the

little female tryoutees that Addison was really Vic
Palrnieri), Denny Tuffanelli gave me Stanford and
1/1000 of a point and 1 jumped at it.
(Heaven help the foes of Washington . . .)
Had some long talks with the Washington fellas
about their splendid football team. One of the backs
hates football (who doesn't) but can't quit. He's got a
wife and two kids to support. Jim Castle, the son of
the athletic director, told me that McElhenny did not
get paid and was earning—all by hisself— a high C
plus grade average. I told him I could match that and
that I didn't even play ball at the U.
Vic decided to head for home about oneish (Tita
wasn't paying her share), and he very graciously
loaned the Queen and I his auto. We went back to
the Egg where Annie was still singing, accompanied
by a flock of Stanfordites. She was still flexing.
Then they started singing an unkind version of
"Irene, Good Night." I still wasn't in the mood, so
we went home. The Queen wasn't in the mood either.
Swell evening.
By the way, from where I was sitting during the
game, the most hated man on the field was neither
Heinrich nor Kirby. It was one of the Stanford junior
football managers who insisted on walking around
with his hands in his pockets and talking to the other
people on the field while the band was playing the
Star Spangled Banner. Looked really swell. Hey,
George, how about shaping those guys up.
It was a good game, in spite of the Berkeley-like
Scotch Tissue-tossers, and again it was up to Palmieri
to come up with the choice comment. (This will ruin
his Tuesday's column, but why should you have to
wait 'til every other day for something priceless?)
"As Gertrude Stein once wrote, 'A bowl, is a bowl, is
a bowl'...
Pass the aspirin and "Heaven help the foes of Wash
ington . . ."

Yeah, we had another party after the game.
(Stop that infernal racket! What are you doing,
sandblaEting the Hoor? Oh, you're tying your shoes.

Well, don't be so noisy about it!)
Didn't go to the Egg because the
Queen and I doubled with Vic and
lita. Vic had been there Friday
night following the 1947 custom of
celebrating the game a day early.
So we went down to Chez Yvonne.
They put us in the back room with
a bunch of loaded ATOs, who in
sisted on singing (in terrible four
part) "In the Evening By the
Moonlight."

I don't know what I was in the mood for, but I know
what I wasn't in the mood for. (The Queen keeps me
prttty well checked out on that.) It was not "In the
Evening by the Moonlight."
OI course it was better than what we were singing.
Oh yes, we were singing—in a strictly Old Fashioned
way. We were with a gang from the University of
Washington. You probably know them, they were a
bunch ol turn-tail Stanfordites: Bartow Fite, Annie
London, and Chuck Donahoe, etc. They were sing
ing "Heaven Help the Foes of Washington, they're
trembling at the feet of mighty Washington . .
It was peachy-keen.
