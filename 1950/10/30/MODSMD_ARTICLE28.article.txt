## The 						Oath Controversy 
### 
To the Editor:
Mr. Buckles' letter on loyalty oaths is an excellent
example of the perverse type of thinking which leads
to the inauguration of them in the first place. He
starts out by saying that of course he is in favor of
freedom of thought and expression but goes on to
qualify it as only that thought and expression which
is "American." But the whole concept becomes abso
lutely meaningless unless it refers to minority opin
ions.
Surely Mr. Buckles knows that students in this
country have been thoroughly indoctrinated with the
glories of free enterprise and intense "Americanism"
from the time they first set foot in kindergarten. They
should certainly have the background to hear differ
ing ideas by the time they reach college.
The fact that Communism does not allow for political
dissent would seem to be irrelevant. If we abandon our
guarantees of freedom the moral issue between the two
ideologies is about equated. And we are abandoning
this freedom by denying Communists the right to work
at the job they are best fitted just as surely as if we
were to throw them in jail.
And why are we having this hysterical abundance of
loyalty oaths, smear campaigns, McCarthyism? The
Communist Party in this country spends most of its
time pointing out that one-third of the nation is ill
housed, that minority groups are the objects of the
most flagrant abuses and inequities in many parts of
the country, that medical care for law-income groups
i.<; lacking, that police brutality against minorities and
poor people is in many places rampant. This kind of
needling is very embarrassing because it's true.
The Communists say it is inherent in the system,
and we haven't proved that it isn't! But instead of
attacking these basic deficiencies thereby weakening
their position, we are trying to fight the Communists
l.y smear and coercion.
If we would spend more time fighting the inequali
ties in this country and strengthening the freedom we
profess to believe in, our position against the Commu
nists both at home and abroad would be much n.ore
secure.
