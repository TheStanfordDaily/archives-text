To the Editor:
There seems to be little doubt in the minds of most
people that the ideals of Americanism are being
trueatened. The differences lie in locating the threats.
Present Communist hysteria has made location diffi
cult, lor it has reached such a level that it is obscuring
other evils.
While combating Communism as a totalitarian idea
we are falling into the use of the very same techniques
which we have so heartily condemned.
If men are guilty of deeds of treason, let them be
punished by law. But if men are guilty of erroneous
thought, let their error be exposed to the punishment
ol reason in the minds of intelligent men.
The oLvious inspiration of this letter is the Cal loy
alty oath, but this is not the only sore spot. Political
opportunists (and many well-meaning citizens) have
plagued the innocent as well as the guilty with care
less use of the term "Communist."
Even Gil Jonas' opinion on the oath has been
branded as "very dangerous" and many readers will
undoubtedly confuse opposition to the oath with an
outright defense of Communism.
r I he role of Stanford in this controversy is important
in adding one more concerted expression of opinion to
those already made, just as a single letter to a con
gies.sman adds to the v/eight of similar letters.
Perhaps such a letter could induce a careful exam
ination of the underlying reasons for the opinion and
thus provide a basis for the reshaping of their own
opinions. The issue might be clarified by adding to
Jonas' resolution a definite condemnation of totali
tarian Communism, making it clear that the opposi
tion is to the method employed, not to the object
against which the method is directed.
