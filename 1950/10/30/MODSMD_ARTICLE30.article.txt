To the Editor:
The letter from R. H. Buckles which appeared in
"Campus Opinion" in defense of the Cal loyalty oath
is an unfortunate example of the fuzzy, befuddled
reason that ii; all too prevalent among Americans on
matters touching upon "patriotism."
All that is needed to gain the support of a large
poition of the American populace for any proposal,
however at variance with our ideals, is to include in
its title such words as "Americanism," "democratic,"
"freedom," or "loyalty." Once such a title has been

adopted, the proponents can count on the support of
all those well-meaning people who are too busy to
read the fine print.
One point especially surprised me in R. H. Buckles'
letter; that was his reference to the dismissed profes
sors are "reds." Even the supporters of the loyalty
oath have never intimated that these professors were
dismissed for being "reds." They were dismissed for
refusing to sign a document which was abhorrent to
them in principle.
The effects of the Cal loyalty oath upon academic
freedom may be open to debate. However, the facts
which a little research make quite clear are that the
loyalty oath is unnecessary, unjust, and ineffective.
It is unnecessary because as State employees, the
Cal professors are required to swear allegiance to the
Federal and State Constitutions.
If Communism is defined as seeking the forceful
overthrow of our government, swearing allegiance to
the Constitution should suffice to show non-Commu
nist intentions.
tl is unjust in that those professors who refused to
sign the oath were dismissed, not for any Communist
affiliations, but for failing to obey the orders of the
Board of Regents. This is clearly a flagrant violation
of the principle of tenure.
It is ineffective because the only dismissal of a Uni
versity of California employee on Communist charges
was that of a teaching assistant in the physics depart
ment, and he was one of the first to sign the oath.
