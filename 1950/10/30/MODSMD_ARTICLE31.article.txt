To ihe Editor:
It is time that the undercurrent came out into the
open. Many say wait, wait until the season is over.
We waited last year and opportunity slipped away;
interest flagged. We got nowhere. This year the con
sequences of our folly are evident. The Rose Bowl is
gone, snatched from the fingers of a bunch of lads
who could very easily have gone.
We have given Mr. Schwartz a chance, a lot of
chances. We have listened to his excuses, we have
tried to see his point of view. But how about giving
the team a chance, how about giving us all a chance?
The difference between Washington and Stanford
was plain to see. It was the difference between a
clenched fist and an open hand. Who tightened the
fist? A good coach. Did you see him before the game
started?—hitting one player jovially, passing a joke,
getting a friendly laugh, and then telling them to do
what they had been so well trained to do—"Give Stan
ford Hell!"
What did we do? We went out on the field, a bunch
of individuals who could really go places if they were
welded into a team. A bunch of players who didn't
have the real feeling of working together, players al
ready infected with that tinge of dissension that could
ruin a team of soiid Ail-Americans.
Is it Marchie's staff? Obviously it is Marchie's staff.
But it is Marchie's job to pick his staff, a job he has
done badly. He is a smooth talker, and he is a gentle
man. These are qualities admirable in any man and a
credit to the school he represents, but they are not the
qualities that are most essential to a good football
coach.
Football is a modified kind of war and it takes a
man with guts to play it. It also takes a man to run
it who knows how to inspire men to get tough, and
to create in them the rather ruthless 'ove of victory.
Marchie is not that sort of man.
How much longer do we have to watch this miser
able squandering of our football reputation?
