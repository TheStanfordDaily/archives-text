# Former Old Vic Actor To Play 'Caesar' Here
## 
### MARIEL MURTON 
There is one young man on the Stanford Farm whom the Univer
sity made considerable effort to bring here—and for reasons other
than football,
He is John Brebner, British actor and director, soon to portray
the title role in the Stanford Players' "Julius Caesar."
Formerly connected with the famous Old Vic company of Lon-

don, Brebner came to this country as
a foreign exchange student in the
Drama Department. John Ferrer and
Sally Cassell are former Stanford
students studying in England now
under this exchange plan.

Although this is his first visit to
the United States, Brebner is no
stranger to travel. He toured the
U.S.-German service zone with the
London Theatre Company's produc
tion of "Gaslight," and acted as stage
manager for the Young Vic Players'
year-long tour of Scotland.
Actors are better off in England
than in the United States, Brebner
believes.
"The British repertory system pro
vides entertainment and employment
all over the country, while here the
theatre is concentrated on Broad
way," he said.
Asked about the United States, the
young actor replied, "I was pretty fa
miliar with America before I came
here, through the movies. I thought
the high standard of living protrayed
in the films was exaggerated, but
now I find, that it wasn't."
Having already found out about

"Cal," Brebner says that similar com
petition is waged between his alma
mater, King's College in London, and
their rival, University College.
"Instead of the Axe, we had a life
size wooden statue of a Highlander
called Phineas," he laughed. "We
raided each other's campuses, too.
When they attempted to storm our
gates, a soot-flour battle usually en
sued. We repulsed them with hoses
and turned the hydrants on them."
Chose Stanford
Stanford was Brebner's first choice
when he was offered the opportunity
to study in Ajnerica. The Stanford
Drama Department's unusual physi
cal facilities give students an oppor
tunity to experiment in lighting and
quick scene changes.
"I am honored to be chosen to play
Caesar," said Brebner, "and hope I
do not inject a too-British influence
among the American voices of the
rest of the cast."
Rehearsals, however, are proving
that all influences, British and Amer
ican, are working together harmo
niously.
