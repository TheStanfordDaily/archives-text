I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT LOVE â– 
By NANCY ERWIN
I want to know about the mistletoe.
Want to live up on the Row,
1 want some fast elucidation
On romantic education.
I want to know about love.
1 want to know what makes a Toni Wave,
Know what makes an Injun Brave,
Because I want to be enlightened
On the things that are excitin'
1 want to know about love,
I want to know about that "second look."
Know about the Kinsey book.
1 want to know, if you will pardon,
What goes on in the Cactus Garden.
I want to know about love.
