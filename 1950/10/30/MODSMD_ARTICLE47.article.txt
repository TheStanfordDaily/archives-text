### DICK KLEIN 
It took the opportunity - wise
Bruins to burst the bubble a week
ago, and now Washington went and
put out the fire. Things could have
worseâ€”there are lew teams
that have suffered more bad breaks
than the Huskies and still come out
on top.
Since neither Coach Odell nor
Schwartz had much to say after
the game, we would like to offer a
lew from ether sources.
Ran into an old high school coach
before Saturday's game. He now
puts on the official's garb each Sat
urday and does a little whistle
tooting. The first question he pops
at me is:
"How'd the UCLA game come
out?"
Told him that tRe score ended
20-G in favor of the Bruins, and
that the Westwooders had stalled
off'a couple of Purdue drives in the
fourth period.
"Those Bruins sure play heads
up football," he countered. "That's
the way they beat you."
We asked him what he thought
about our poor showing in the Coli
seum. He replied that we have not
been playing GO minutes of football
in each game. He went on to say
that maybe we are Jacking that
certain something.
Just then, the fire truck came
roaring up the road in answer to
the honking of the fire horn. The
department could have been more
useful in putting out the fire that
was roaring all afternoon in the
stadium.
Sat next to the old Farm faithful,
Dink Templeton. When the Cards
made that desperation rally right
before the half ended, Dink finally
perked up and showed some inter
est. The drive ended on the five
yard marker with Marchie sending
in the kicking gimmick for a field
goal attempt.
It was then that many old tim
ers turned and nodded to Dink,
remembering how he had won a
Washington - Stanford game with
a field goal. That score was 3-0
in 1925. "We won that one with
nothing hut prayers," mumbled
the Dink.
"Watch Marchie come up with
some real tricks in this next half.
This will be our half."
About a half - hour later Mr.
Tempetoii left the press box.
There were still four minutes to
go in the game, and Dink seldom
leaves before the final play.
Seems that Dink had lost all hope
and was plenty disgusted because
of the lack of Card quarterback -
irig.
It was Howie Odell's boys that
came up with the tricks all day
long, and especially the long pass
that allowed Captain Cloidt to score
his first PCC touchdown right at
the beginning of the second half.
After the game, we headed to
ward the dressing room. On the
way out, we overheard some alums.
" T -isten to those students. There
sure will be some fur flying this
week."
Met/the man in black-and-white
at the locker room. He must re
main unnamed as he told me not
to quote him. "Bad for officials to
comment on games they work."
"It's the same thing. They lack
the zip. On a fumble, they'll be
a step behind. They don't get
the jump that a winning team
does."
Asked if he felt that the Big Red
Machine had the parts, he replied,
"In spots they really showed the
stuff. But never long enough, or
often enough."
"You play SC next week, don't
you?" he asked.
We were sure of that, and told
him so.
"It should be a good game. Good
luck!"
We began hoping that we would
n't need luck, because you just
can't rely on the old Lady.
