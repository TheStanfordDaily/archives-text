# Frosh Gridders Turn In Effortless Victory Over San Jose State, 28 to 7
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's frosh footballers, ap
pearing as if they wanted to start |
another win streak, ho - hummed
their vvay to an effortless 28 to 7
triumph over the San Jose State
yearlings on Saturday.
Stanford frosh teams had won 16
in a row up to this year. Then the
Papooses dropped their first game
to Santa Clara by the margin of an
amoeba's eyelash, 14 to 13. After
that they humbled UCLA, 34 to 7,
and continued with their victory
march on Saturday.
Actually, San Jose was never in
the ball game. After the first five
minutes, it was as certain as Whirl
away in the stretch that the Card
babes would win. Only when Stan
ford flocked reserves into the game
in the final quarter could San Jose
generate enough power to score.
Scheidecker Caps Drive
Stanford scored early as half Bill
Scheidecker capped a long drive by
plunging over for the score. Bob
Garrett, who kicks with his left
foot and throws with his right arm,
added the extra point.
Penalties stalled the two teams'
attacks for the rest of the first half,
the only tally being a safety scored
by Stanford. Halfback Bob Hamil
ton was smeared in the end zone by 1

a group of Redshirts led by end
Dud Ilerschback.
Stanford scored three times in
the final half, thanks to a reserve
half by the name of Hank Guilen.
Guillen bobbed and weaved all
over the field as he spearheaded
two drives ajid climaxed both by
knifing oft- tackle for the scores.
All the Way
The last Papoose touchdown was
scored in sensational fashion. Bill
Scheidecker gathered in a San Jose
punt on the midfield stripe, and
proceeded to do a tight rope act
down the sidelines. Sprung loose
by beautiful downfield blocking, he
boomed into the end zone to chalk
up the twenty-eighth point.
San Jose countered their one and
only marker on a pass from quar
terback Maurice Duncan to full
back Bill Kennedy.
Stanford's victory was not with
out its costs. Dick Gant, the big
tackle, wrenched an ankle while
Andy Thompson, also a tackle, re
injured his leg.
Looking good for Coach Bob Ghi
lotti's crew were halfbacks Schei
decker, Guillen, and Cook, quarter
backs Doug Collins and Garrett,
center Dick Steele, tackle Barry
Smith, and end Tom Howell.
Next week, USC's Trojans come
to town to do battle with Stanford's
rollicking Papooses.
