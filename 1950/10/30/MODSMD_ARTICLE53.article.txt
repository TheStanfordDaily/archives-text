### 
After outfighting and outplaying
the Bears most of the way, Stan

breaker to Cal in the last four min
utes of play Saturday.
The Indians took the lead only
25 seconds after the opening kick
off when Leo Weinstein scored.
The Bears then came from behind
to knot the couni with a goal by
Phil Arnott.

most of the first half, but there was
no more scoring until midway in
the third period. At this point Ar
nott kicked his second goal of the
contest for the Bears. The Cards

Stark tying the score only a minute
later.
Indians Take Lead
Shortly after the fourth quarter
opened the Indians went into the
lead, Stark scoring again after a
nice assist from the Cal fullback.
But Cal again came from behind,
and Aly Kocaman tied the score
with a tricky shot into the corner
of the net.
Both teams then pressed for the
winning goal, but it was the Card
defense which failed. Joe Barbero
broke through to score the decisive
counter for Cal only three minutes
before the final whistle.
Play Best Game
Even though they lost, Coach
Graham thought his men played
"their best soccer of the year."
Typical of their inspired play was
the action of John Sentous midway
through the final period. He was
the only man with a chance to stop
the Cal right wing who had a clear
shot at the goal. Making a desper
ate leap, he saved the goal, though
he sprained his ankle badly in do
ing so.
