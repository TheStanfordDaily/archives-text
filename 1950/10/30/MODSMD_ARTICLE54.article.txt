## WATER POLO Indians Whip Bears 7 to 5 
### 
Saturday morning in the Encina
Pool the Stanford water polo team
came from behind in at free-fouling
contest to defeat Cal 7 to 5.
Five Bears and six Indians were
ejected via the foul route and a
total of 66 personal fouls were
called, as the game at times threat
ened to become almost as much of
a farce as Olympic champion Dick
Harlan's comedy diving routine.
Stanford started slowly, and the
Bears, with Waldo Cook scoring
twice, boasted a 2 to 1 lead at the
close of the first quarter.
In the second period a pair of
Indian goals by Bob Frojen, who
with Cal's Cook was the outstand
ing player in the pool, only matched
another braec by the latter; and
the Indians climbed from the tank
at half-time on the short end of a
4 to 2 count.

Dick Harlan's diving after the
game, both serious and comic,
drew much praise and laughter
from an appreciative audience.
His appearance added so much
to the attendance and interest at
the game that Coach Tom Haynie
has promised further exhibitions
in the future.

However, midway thi-ough the
third quarter, after Herb Steiner
added Cal's fifth and last point,
Stanford suddenly exploded.
Hub Stokely countered to start
the rally. Then Don Weeden
counted twice to tie the score. The
second came on a beautiful inter
ception, as Weeden reached high
into the air for a pass thrown by
Jim Lindquist, the Cal goalie, and
then slammed it almost down his
throat.
In the opening seconds of the
final quarter Frojen scored a nice
pass from Ash Jones to send the
Indians into a lead they never re
linquished. Weeden then iced the
game with his third goal of the day.
