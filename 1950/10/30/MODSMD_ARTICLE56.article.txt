# '53 Mermen Dunk Cal Frosh, 7 to 0
## 
### 
Scoring their third win and sec
ond shut-out in the last three days,
the high-flying Indian frosh water
polo team shut out a weak Cal
frosh seven Saturday morning 7
to 0.
In a game only about one-half
as rough as their elder brothers',
the yearlings scored once in each
of the first three periods, then fin
ished with a flood of three goals
in the final quarter.
In other games last week the
frosh routed Sequoia High 12 to 4
on Friday, and blanked Paly High
5 to 0 on Thursday.
