## 
### 
Stanford firemen were called to .
put out two small blazes—a hay fire
Saturday morning and a rubbish fire
early Sunday morning — following
close on the heels of the five-day
rainy period.
The hay fire occurred at the Aguira
Ranch on Foothill road shortly after
2 p.m. Saturdtty.
The top of a pile of hay bales caught !
fire, endangering the whole stack oi !
hay which jammed a 50 by 100 foot |
I nrn. The Stanford Fire Department,
responding with two trucks carrying !
I,i!00 gallons of water, used only 50 1
gallons to subdue the fire.
The small amount of water was
used Jo keep the hay as dry as possi
ble and reduce the chance for spon
taneous combustion.
As the fire was put out on each
bale, the hay was rolled outside the
bain. Damage was estimated at a
dozen bales ol partially-burnt hay.
Cause of the fire was unknown.
The second fire, involving used
lumber and rubbish, sent a truck
and three men to Intcrdale about 1
a.m. Sunday morning.
The fire proved stubborn and GOO j
gallons of water and an hour's time !
were necessary to put it out. There |
was no damage reported. The cause j
was unknown.


HEY, HAY—Firemen rolled the bales out of the barn as soon as
the fire was put out on each one. The fire occurred on the Aguira
Ranch on Foothill road shortly before the Stanford-Washington
football game Saturday. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson
