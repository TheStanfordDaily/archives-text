# More Accurate Light Speed Set by Stanford Physicists
## 
### 
Stanford University physi
| cists, using new microwave
techniques, have measured the
speed of light with a precision
believed to be 10 to 20 times that
of previous methods.
The accomplishment, of vital inter- J
est to many branches of science and
offering military applications in the
use of radar and loran, was an- |
nounced yesterday in a letter to the i
editor of the current issue of the |
Physical Review.
< The announcement, climaxing
five years of research, set the new
figure for the speed of light at 186-
280 miles per second, plus or minus
.0002 per cent, instead of the gen
erally accepted figure of 186,272
miles per second, drawn from av- j
rages computed by many scientists
over a period of 25 years.
Most of the earlier computations ;
were made by direct methods—meas- |
uring visible or near visible light
waves, generally over a long dis
tance.
The Stanford figure was arrived
at by measuring in an enclosed
■ cylinder the characteristics of radi >
j waves which have the some speed j
as light waves.
This technique, while requiring j
! complicated controls for precision 1
measurements, is so relatively simple,
Stanford scientists said, that first-
I year graduate students in a regular
! three-hour laboratory period meas
ure the speed of light with accuracy
comparable to the best results se
cured by A. A. Michelson in the ex
! periments which won him the 1907
| Nobel prize in physics.
To get further accuracy, hov/cver,
requires rigidly precise controls, in
| finite pains, measurements accurate
j to a millionth of an inch, and tedious
! calculations which occupy an expert
j mathematician for a month or more. !
The idea of determining the
speed of light by measuring (he
j characteristics of radio waves in an
enclosed space was originated by
Dr. William W. Hansen, Stanford
physicist who died in May, 1940.
Dr. Edward Ginzton, Stanford pro
fessor of physics and director of Iho '
I University's Microwave Laboratory, ;
i assisted Dr. Hansen in the dcvelop
] ;ncnt of experimental techniques lor
j the research and has supervised the
| research since Hansen's death.
The major part of the research,
I which was financed by the Sperry
I Gyroscope Company, was done bv

Dr. Kees 80l of Palo Alto and Dr.
William J. Barclay of Portland, Ore.,
both graduate students in physics at
Stanford. Dr. 80l did most of the
precision measurement work.
While the theory behind the dis
covery is relatively simple, the exe
cution is so complex, that it took
five years and the full-time efforts
of two men over the entire period.
What is the value of the new figure
for the speed of light?
First, and most important to sci
entists, the speed of light is one of
the most fundamental constants of
nature and as such is of value to
physicists, astronomers, and engi
neers, who use it as a factor in many
basic formulae.
II is also of importance in radar
and loran, where calculations using
the speed of radio waves—which
arc the same as that of light—de
termine the distance of targets,
ships, or points of land.
Stanford physicists are currently
running a new series of experiments,
results of which will not be available
for five or six months. They expect
these results to be even more precise
than their current figure.


DR. EDWARD GINZTON, left, Stanford physicist, and Arthur W.
Hornig, research associate, prepare to measure the interior of the
cylinder used in Stanford experiments to get a new and more
precise measurement of the speed of light. The measuring de
vice, which enables the cavity interior to be measured to an ac
curacy of a millionth of an inch, played an important role in
making the experiment a success. The speed of light is deter
mined by measuring the characteristics of radio waves in this
cylinder.
