# Sakai to See; Police Seek Pranksters
## 
### 
Roy Sakai will see with his right
eye.
Dr. George Houck, director of the
Stanford Health Service, announced
yesterday that the eye will be saved
and that partial vision will be re
stored.
It was feared for the past weeks
since Sakai was injured that it
might be impossible to save his eye
at all. The cornea and other parts
of the eye were severely damaged
when a water bag hit Saaki in the
face and broke his glasses.
The incident occurred almost
three weeks ago. Sakai was walk
ing back toward Stern with three
friends after following the band
down the Row toward the Santa
Clara rally.
Walking past the parking lot
across from Stern, they hollered at
a car going past to turn on its lights.
For reply, a vtater bag, later found
to be a balloon filled with water,
was thrown at them.
The. other men got wet. Sakai
took the full impact of the missile
on his right eye and has' spent the
ensuing time in Palo Alto Hospital.
Dr. Houck stated that Sakai is one
is one of the most cheerful patients
he has ever encountered. Other
doctors attending him and his
friends have commented on his
cheerful frame of mind and outlook
throughout the ordeal.
Police have not yet made a posi
tive identification of the car from
which the waterbag was thrown or
the persons in the car.
