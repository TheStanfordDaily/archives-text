# Professor Inspects Active Volcanoes
## 
### TOM NEVILLE 
Modest Dr. Konrad Krauskopf, professor of geochemistry in
Stanford's Mineral Sciences Department, claims that "volcanoes
are only a sideline" with him. The professor will speak at 7:30
tonight in Memorial Auditorium on the Tuesday Evening Series
program.
Because of this self-styled hobby, he was asked in 1945 by the

United States Geological Survey in
Washington to study the infant Mexi
can volcano, Paricutin, which as
tounded the volcanic world during
the war by suddenly arising out of a
flat plain.
In 1 !»47 the same bureau sent Dr.
Krauskopf to Japan as Chief of the
United States Geographical Survey
in Tokyo. He signed a contract with
the Army Intelligence for two
years, after which lie received a ci
tation for meritorious civilian serv
ice. "I used to spend my week
ends looking for volcanoes over
there," he recalled.
These weekend excursions in the
Orient and the four months lie spent
in Mexico have produced a scries of
colored slides, which Dr. Krauskopf
will show tonight.
"Paricutin made a lot of noise
while we worked around it, but il
wasn't dangerous. The lava flows
moved slowly, and you could even go
up and poke a stick into them," he
remarked. "Volcanoes aren't nearly
as bad as the nswspapers would ha Vie
you believe."
Describing the procedure used in
investigating a live volcano, Dr.
Krauskopf said that anything you
CPn record is of use, for instance
type and amount of gases, earth
quake tremors, amount of lava and
ash. "Even with this information,
we don't get too far."
Dr. Krauskopf is currently doii:.;
research work on the origin of phos -
phate deposits and the character of
vein-forming solutions. His main in
terest is in the field of geochemistry.
In fact, he can't understand why he
is "labeled a volcanologist." He in -
sists he hardly knows anything about
volcanoes at all.


ASHES AND LAVA—Dr. Konrad Krauskopf, whose hobby is
volcanoes, will give an illustrated lecture tonight. A geology
professor, he took the slides in his spare time while he worked
and studied in Mexico and Japan.
