Campus and national elections always sneak
up oji us, and we discover there is only a week
before we have to decide on some candidate or
issue.
Students eligible to vote in the national elec
tions must apply for an absentee ballot by
Thursday. Although your one vote may seem
like a small thing when you start thinking
about obtaining an application blank from your
county clerk, the election results this year may
be crucial. International policy as well as mat
ters of national concern such as the various
draft proposals may be focused on the ballot.
For students with campus political aspira
tions, the class and living group positions offer
opportunity for leadership training. You don't
have to be a political science sparkplug to file
lor nomination in a Stanford election.
In the past, some of the best officers and
representatives have been those who pos
sessed a will to work rather than a profound
knowledge of political clockwork around the
Quad.

Rivalry between Cal and Stanford seems to
have appeared for its dress rehearsal even
earlier this year than in past years. With the
burning of a "C ' on Stanford lawns and the
painting of the big "C" inside the Berkeley

stomping grounds, all the students' attention
is directed toward the Big Game.
As usual the student and administrative
leaders of both schools have put their heads
together for a truce lest property be damaged
on one or both campuses.
Before arming themselves with atom bombs
and heading for the enemy camp, Stanford
"bear-busters" should consider the easy target
our own Hoover Tower furnishes for the oppo
sition.
Perhaps some enterprising Indians can
dream up an idea which will humble Cal with
out leaving a trail of property damage and a
broken non-aggression pledge.
Dr. William Bark and his student committee
which has interviewed well over 50 applicants
for Grants-in-Aid are to be commended for
their interest and time-consuming efforts.
Were it not for Stanford's outstanding pro
gram of Grants-in-Aid, many deserving stu
dents would not be able to handle the high
tuition.

We understand some of the Palo Alto chil
dren will not be asking for the usual treats to
night, but instead v/ill seek buttons, thread,
etc., for charity use. It will be interesting to
see if the Branner women celebrate Halloween
with their usual tricks and treats.
