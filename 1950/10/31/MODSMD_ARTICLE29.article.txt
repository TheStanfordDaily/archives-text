# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
I see where A 1 Berry, Stanford's own Cholly Knick
orLocker, is making a real bid for immortality . . .
or didn't you notice he started my biography in yester
day's Bull Session? Well, his mother told me once

] was Al's childhood ideal, and so
l guess I should give the kid a
!.i < ak and let him use my name in
In: column. He isn't the first
youngster I've helped, by any
means.
Why, if I've heard Laurence
Olivier say it once, I've heard him
;:ay it a thousand times . . ."I'd
be nobody today if it hadn't been

lor Old Vic" . . . Anyhow, if Berry keeps this up
I swear I'll make him First Lady of the Farm and he
can call his column "My Night" instead of Bull Ses
sion.
Did you read last week in Life where the Supreme
Court has finally handed down a decision on the
tamous Swett case in Oklahoma, ending the dispute
ever .segregation in Southern universities? 'Course
why they wanted to segregate people just because
they perspiied in class is beyond me . . . must be
uncommon sensitive down there. Personally though,
1 think we should practice a little segregation right
litiH at Stanford. I'm in favor ol segregating all people
v. ho write letters to the Daily about segregation.
I ve wondered about that Supreme Court of ours
< ver since I took Poly Sci I. Just think of those nine
men spending all their time putting things so they'll
coriiu-jij as many people as possible, lake those
: 'ai'gbtei house cases, lor instance . . . they settled
« v* .• > i hin-j irom counterfeiting rebates to stealing bi
<yil».. in Quad but they've got about as much to Jo
with :lauj liter houses as George Bernard Shaw. And
how about McCulloch v. Maryland? 'Ihey make such
.. whoop-de-do about the thing and I'll be doggorjed
il 1 ei n ;«i what poor old McCulloch ever did to Mary
land to deserve such treatment.
Hue at Stanford we've got one of the finest law

schools in the country, I hear tell. 'Course it's the
only school I know of where they send you a box of
sleeping tablets instead of a cinch notice. I don't want
to say those guys study a lot, but I notice they buy
their books by the pound.
1 heard they had a Polish foreign student there last
year, but he must have gotten homesick because he
applied for transfer back to Dachau.
I would have been a lawyer myself but I couldn't
make it past the bar and wound up an alcoholic
instead. I even took the lav,- aptitude test and must
have done pretty well because Dean Spaeth called
me in and told me he was convinced my future lay
in crime.
If you ever want a laugh, drop into one of those
law classes. It's a must for history majors, in fact. The
methods those law profs use come straight from the
Spanish Inquisition. Best of all is the way they run
down the seating chart, mumbling the names out loud,
trying to decide who to call on.
I saw one prof keep it up for a full five minutes until
the poor devil in the back row finally broke and
screamed: "all right, I'm unprepared ... go ahead,
call on me . . . you know you will!!!" They led him
ofl still hysterical, and the class broke into the "Ballad
of Roger Young."
What I want to know though is who designed (he
new Law School Building. He was either a practical
joker 01 a physical culture addict, what with the libe
on (he third Hoor and the john in the basement.
Those guys will all be Paavo Nurmis by (he time
(hey get out af(er running up and down three fligh(s
of stairs five or 10 times a day.
Having been brought up in a family of lawyers (my
lavorjte sport as a child was sliding down barristers)
I leel qualified to pass on this piece of advice to all
undergradu; tes —freshmen especially—who are plan
ning on law school: think twice men, remember Ein
stein would never have discovered relativity if he
hadn t flunked out of Stanlord Law "School.
Times have changed—it's the haberdashers who
make the presidents nowadays.
