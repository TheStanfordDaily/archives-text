### 
NEW DELHI, India â€” The boy
Dalai Lama of Tibet appealed to
India for diplomatic help today, and
was reported preparing to flee to
this country for refuge as Chinese
Communist spearheads thrust with
in 200 miles of his capital of Lhasa.
Official Indian government re
ports, which finally reached here
after days of uncertainty, left no
doubt that the Communists were
well started on a full-scale inva
sion. They have passed disputed
border territory and are inside Ti
bet proper, it was indicated.
The possibility was discussed
here that Tibet might appeal di
rect to the United Nations for help.
But late reports indicated that
the invasion was moving too fast to
permit effective diplomatic action.
