# Personal Property, Education Proposals Seen as Crucials on Next Week's Ballot
## 
### CORNELIA LITTLE Political Editor, The Daily 
(Editor's Note.—This is the first of a series of
a; thief, on the constitutional issues which will face
California voters at (lie polls Nov. 7. Cornelia Little,
Daily political editor, has attempted to present both
sides < 112 each amendment proposal so that Stanford
ve.ters will have a clear idea of what the issues are.)
Personal property" means much more than arm
chair.l: or automobiles.
Proposition 1 on the California ballot for November,
labeled as repeal ol personal property taxation," is
actually a measure designed largely to lighten the tax
load on business, railroads, and public utilities. For,
in the "lolklore of capitalism" (thank you, Thurman
Ai nold), a business or a corporation is a person, and its
equipment, machinery, and inventories are its per
sonal property.
Proponents of this initiative constitutional amend
nif nt, which comes before the voters next Tuesday,
( lain, thai it will give California industry a shot in the
a tin and will benefit the consumer as well. Business
i'j carrying too much of the tax load, they say, and
they point to the- states of New York and Delaware in
which there is no personal property tax. (Five other
state* do not collect personal properly taxes on house
hold 'joods, which is somewhat of a different matter.)
They also point out that taxes on producers are passed
on to the consumer in the form of higher prices.
Now for some figures. (Source: Transactions of the
Commonwealth Club of California.) Proposition I
would, il passed, save the homeowner and renter the
tax on his household goods and probably that on his
automobile. It would also mean a savjng, to tele-
I hone companies, of .">5 per cent of the taxes the*y now
pay; to railroads, a saving of 27.0 per cent, to corpora
tions, a saving of 37 per cent. The state and local gov
ernment would lose approximately $300,000,000.
Obviously, this loss woulel have to he made tip by
increasing taxes in other fields. Real estate taxes
could he tipped; income taxes could he increased; so
could sales taxes.

Proposition I does not provide for these compensa
tory increases; fui thermore, it takes effect immediately
upon passage in the middle ol both the fiscal and
school years which may force immediate action and
economy, but wiil leave state and local taxing units
high and dry particularly school districts. School;,
could lose approximately $54,000,000, or 21 to 33per
cent ol their present local tax income—and it is pre
dicted that il this happened many districts might have
to close before June.
A group known as the United Taxpayers of Cali
fornia is the principal proponent of this amendment;
xanged against it are representatives of such groups as
the California Congress of Parents and Teachers, the
Scate Chamber of Commerce, the Farm Bureau Fed
eration, the AP'L, the California State Teachers Asso
ciation, and the Board of Equalization.
Among the less controversial measures to he sub
mitted to the people of California next week are
Propositions Sand W. These too are amendments to
the poor old California Constitution, the first having
originated in the Assembly and the second in the
Senate.
Proposition 8 would remove the existing consti
tional stipulation that salaries of certain local officials
may not be ini reased during their terms of office. This
violates a long-established principle of democratic
government, hut it was proposed to demedy an exist
ing situation wherein members of a county board of
supervisors receive different rates of compensation be
cause of overlapping terms of office.
Proposition !) would exempt from the state civil
service system two classes of temporary employees
who are employed only part-time during one season
ol the year.
1 hese are employees of the district agricultural
as.se r iations, which hold district fairs for a few weeks
ent of the yerr, and employers of the California
More Racing Hoard who arc taken on only for the
racing seasons. | lie amendment also other
loopholes in tin- pre -ent civil service provisions.
