# Student Tells Excom About Free Berlin U.
## 
### 
A brief sketch of student life at the Free University of Berlin was
given Excom members last week by Claus Vollmer, foreign schol- j
arship student from Germany. At the same time, Vollmer thanked
the ASSU for the opportunity to attend Stanford.
The movement to create the Free University of Berlin in the

Western Zone grew out of Commu
nist domination over the age - old
University of Berlin, Vollmer told
the student representatives.
After the war, according to his
story, there was little left of the
university, which had been badly
damaged by bombs. At first, classes
were conducted in other buildings
and the students made use of any
books they could find.
Russians Step In
The first post-war student gov
ernment was freely elected, but the
Russians soon began imposing their
will, such as requiring that Red
flags be flown. This met with the
opposition of the students, and the
student body president and two
others were arrested. The three
havfen't been heard of since, Voll
mer said.
When the Russians began to re
strict the University for the use of

Communists, 2,000 students assem
bled to seek a free university in
Western Berlin, a university where
there would be freedom of teaching
and no fear of arrest. From this
movement, the Free University of
Berlin was born.
Faculty Bars Communists
Hardened against Communism by
their experience, the 5,000 students
of the Free University refuse to al -
low any Communist to teach there.
Likewise, Fascists are barred from
the faculty.
Forty per cent of the students are
from East Berlin, Vollmer said, and
many cannot afford the tuition of ■
3GO marks ($80) a year. Their tui- |
tion, and the money to run the uni- \
versity, is provided by the city gov- i
ernment, the U.S. military occupa- j
tion government, and several pri
vate institutions.
