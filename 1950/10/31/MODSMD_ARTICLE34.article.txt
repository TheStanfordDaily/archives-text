## Cardinal Close-ups 
### 
Last night, we received word from Dr. Stanley Lourdeaux, Stanford team
physician, that end Ron Eadie, who played such a marvelous defensive game
against Washington last Saturday, had to have a cast put on his ankle which
was injured in the Husky game.
Eadie, thereby, joined the long list of injured Card players, just as he was
beginning to come into his own. Halfback Boyd Benson, tackle Dick
Gaedtke, and end Marv Tennefoss also received injuries in last Saturday's
game, although the Huskies aren't generally considered to be an unusually
rough tam.
Let us for a minute review the ever-growing Indian injury list, which
u> the present time, looks something like this:
Gordy Whit'j—The big tackle has a recurrent sprained ankle injury
which, as yet, hasn't responded to treatment.
Kuss Pcmeroy—Russ has a hemorrhage in the muscle of his power leg.
He probably will not work out until Thursday, but may be able to play
against the Trojans on Saturday.
Hol> Scott The rangy end got a bone separation in his ankle during the
Santa Clara gi;me, end has been unable to play since. He is on the question
mark list for this Saturday.
Eric Southward—Eric's present injury is a pulled muscle on the inside of
his thigh. Previously he suffered lrom a sprained ankle, and a bad outside
thigh muscle.
Boyd Benson The hard-running halfback received a cracked rib in the
Hu.sky fracas, and, in addition, he has been slewed down by a severe charley
horse.
Chuck Esscgian—Chuck has a strained ligament and a questionable carti
lage in his knee. He might be able to play Saturday.
Bruce Van Alstyne—Bruce, who saw action for a few plays against the
Huskies, is still wearing a knee brace, and will be slated for limited action
only this week.
Owen INiwell — Owen has a strained ligament in his knee, but it is im
proving.
Jack Itye—The sterling defensive end has had a battle with mononucleosis.
He's still in a weakened condition, and probably will be out of the Trojan
game.
Norm Manoogian—Norm, who missed a couple of games earlier this season,
will probably be in better shape Saturday, but still needs to get his injured
knee in top condition.
Dick Gaedtke—Dick had X-rays taken of his face, which was smashed in
the Hu.sky game, but there is no report as yet. There were injuries incurred
on his eye and cheekbone.
Dick Horn—Dick has his left hand bandaged because of a thumb injury.
iWarv TcniH'ioss—The much-improved end has his hand in a splint because
of a broken bone received in the Washington game.
As you may notice, every one of Stanford's first string offensive line ex
cept lot end Bill McColl and center Dick Abraham, has been hurt sometime
during this season. You can't find two better tackles on the Pacific Coast
than Russ Pomeroy and Gordy White, if they were playing in top shape.
Rugged guards Norm Manoogian and Owen Powell would be hard to leave
oil any first team, if they weren't slowed down by injuries. And, of course,
end Bruce Van Alstyne, who played such an outstanding game against Ore
gon State, would be invaluable both as a pass receiver and a linebacker if he
c ould get his wrenched knee into shape.
It's a credit to the team that, with all these injuries, Stanford still had a
7 to 7 tie with a powerful Washington eleven, even as late as the end of the
third quarter.
What is the reason for this unprecedented number of injuries? This ques
tion is a hard one to answer, and it probably is due to a combination of fac
tors. It might be due to "hard luck"; however, multiple injuries have
plagued the Indians for several seasons. It might be due to excessive rough
play by Stanford's opponents, though we haven't witnessed too much rough
ness tills season. It also might be due to the conditioning of the Card play
ers, which is so important to a team that has few available reserves.
* * *
Several people have asked why Stanford did not call time out in the last
few seconds of the first half when the Indians were on the Washington 5-yard
line, and had a golden opportunity for a quick touchdown.
The 1950 NCAA Rule Eook says: "After a team's five free time outs are
exhausted, subsequent requests by its field captain may be granted only for
the benefit of £ designated injured player."
It alsi states hat "the referee may order the game clock started or stopped
whenever, in hit' opinion, cither team is trying to conserve or consume play
ing time by tactics obviously unfair."

game, although the Huskies aren't generally considered to be an unusually
rough tam.
Let us for a minute review the ever-growing Indian injury list, which
u> the present time, looks something like this:
Gordy Whit'j—The big tackle has a recurrent sprained ankle injury
which, as yet, hasn't responded to treatment.
Kuss Pcmeroy—Russ has a hemorrhage in the muscle of his power leg.
He probably will not work out until Thursday, but may be able to play
against the Trojans on Saturday.
Hol> Scott The rangy end got a bone separation in his ankle during the
Santa Clara gi;me, end has been unable to play since. He is on the question
mark list for this Saturday.
Eric Southward—Eric's present injury is a pulled muscle on the inside of
his thigh. Previously he suffered lrom a sprained ankle, and a bad outside
thigh muscle.
Boyd Benson The hard-running halfback received a cracked rib in the
Hu.sky fracas, and, in addition, he has been slewed down by a severe charley
horse.
Chuck Esscgian—Chuck has a strained ligament and a questionable carti
lage in his knee. He might be able to play Saturday.
Bruce Van Alstyne—Bruce, who saw action for a few plays against the
Huskies, is still wearing a knee brace, and will be slated for limited action
only this week.
Owen INiwell — Owen has a strained ligament in his knee, but it is im
proving.
Jack Itye—The sterling defensive end has had a battle with mononucleosis.
He's still in a weakened condition, and probably will be out of the Trojan
game.
Norm Manoogian—Norm, who missed a couple of games earlier this season,
will probably be in better shape Saturday, but still needs to get his injured
knee in top condition.
Dick Gaedtke—Dick had X-rays taken of his face, which was smashed in
the Hu.sky game, but there is no report as yet. There were injuries incurred
on his eye and cheekbone.
Dick Horn—Dick has his left hand bandaged because of a thumb injury.
iWarv TcniH'ioss—The much-improved end has his hand in a splint because
of a broken bone received in the Washington game.
As you may notice, every one of Stanford's first string offensive line ex
cept lot end Bill McColl and center Dick Abraham, has been hurt sometime
during this season. You can't find two better tackles on the Pacific Coast
than Russ Pomeroy and Gordy White, if they were playing in top shape.
Rugged guards Norm Manoogian and Owen Powell would be hard to leave
oil any first team, if they weren't slowed down by injuries. And, of course,
end Bruce Van Alstyne, who played such an outstanding game against Ore
gon State, would be invaluable both as a pass receiver and a linebacker if he
c ould get his wrenched knee into shape.
It's a credit to the team that, with all these injuries, Stanford still had a
7 to 7 tie with a powerful Washington eleven, even as late as the end of the
third quarter.
What is the reason for this unprecedented number of injuries? This ques
tion is a hard one to answer, and it probably is due to a combination of fac
tors. It might be due to "hard luck"; however, multiple injuries have
plagued the Indians for several seasons. It might be due to excessive rough
play by Stanford's opponents, though we haven't witnessed too much rough
ness tills season. It also might be due to the conditioning of the Card play
ers, which is so important to a team that has few available reserves.
* * *
Several people have asked why Stanford did not call time out in the last
few seconds of the first half when the Indians were on the Washington 5-yard
line, and had a golden opportunity for a quick touchdown.
The 1950 NCAA Rule Eook says: "After a team's five free time outs are
exhausted, subsequent requests by its field captain may be granted only for
the benefit of £ designated injured player."
It alsi states hat "the referee may order the game clock started or stopped
whenever, in hit' opinion, cither team is trying to conserve or consume play
ing time by tactics obviously unfair."
Last night, we received word from Dr. Stanley Lourdeaux, Stanford team
physician, that end Ron Eadie, who played such a marvelous defensive game
against Washington last Saturday, had to have a cast put on his ankle which
was injured in the Husky game.
Eadie, thereby, joined the long list of injured Card players, just as he was
beginning to come into his own. Halfback Boyd Benson, tackle Dick
Gaedtke, and end Marv Tennefoss also received injuries in last Saturday's
game, although the Huskies aren't generally considered to be an unusually
