## 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
Despite the loss of several stand
out trackmen who had been tabbed
for Stanford, Frosh Coach Ray
Dean still is looking forward to
having a very good yearling team
next spring.
The squad, with its greatest
strength in the middle distances,
will he built around Glendale's
SCIF 880 champ, Warren San
born, and high hurdler Jerry
Wood of La Joila. Sanborn's best
competitive mark is 1.57; Wood
has a 14.4 clocking in the highs.
Other promising newcomers are:
pole vaulters Marv Miller of
Claremont and Jim Mcindoe of
Burlingame, who have marks of
12 ft. 9 in. and 12 ft. 1 in. respec
tively; Sequoia's Larry Broeren,
who has paced the half in 2:00.1;
hurdler Johnny Steinberg from
Mill burn High in New Jersey, who
nabbed all-state in the highs and
third in the lows; quarter - milers
Bob Bly of Santa Cruz and Fred
George and Don Carlson, team
mates from Lowell. Their respective
bests are 50.8, 49.9, and 50.8.
George also has a 22.5 furlong to
his credit.
Irwin Holton from Tamalpais
looks like the top sprinter in a small
group of dash candidates. His prep
marks were 10.2 and 22.2. High
jumper Dave Epperson of Wood
land, with a leap of 5 ft. 11% in.,
and shot putter Barry Smith of In
glewood, with a heave of 52 ft. BV2
in., appear to be best men in their
fields.
Bob Bethke of Appleton, Wiscon
sin, who has sped the high hurdles

in 14.8, and weightman Don Har
court from Webb Prep of Southern
California, who has put the shot 51
ft. 6 in. and tossed the discus 130
