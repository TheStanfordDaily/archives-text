# Marchie To Use Platoons

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 30 (UP)
— Marchie Schwartz, a long time
against the platoon system, suc
cumbed to the modern improve
ment today as he announced that in
the future all Stanford games will
be played with separate units for
offense and defense.
"As much as I hate to play it that
way, and as much as I'm against
platoon systems," Schwartz said to
day, "the Washington game con
vinced me that the platoon system
is the only way to play the present
day football."
Ir. the Washington game. Stan
ford and the Huskies were tied 0-0
at the half-time; but the Indians
ran out of gas and Washington won,
27-7.
"Our fellows played good foot
ball, but they just get fagged out
trying to go the full distance against
fresh players," said Schwartz. The
coach said that his players are in
good condition—but in the present
day game where there are 118 plays,
as there were last Saturday — one
man can't go at full speed that dis
tance.
"I believe that our Bill McColl
probably is in the best physical
condition of any footbal player in
America. He doesn't smoke nor
drink, and he gets plenty of sleep.
Still, when playing a full game, he
tires in the last half."
"I'm going to put 22 men on the
defensive squad and 22 on the of
fensive roster," he said. "And that's
the way they are going to stay. It
may be that our defense will fce
weakened a bit, but I'm sure we'll
get more ball control from our fresh
offensive team this way."
