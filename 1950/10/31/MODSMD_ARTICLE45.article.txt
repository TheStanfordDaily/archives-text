# Mysterious Frenchman Left Farm Towers, Scores of Legends,
## 
### BEV BOCK 
An old brick tower stands on
Page Mill Road.
Beside Frenchman's Road there is
a picturesque stone bridge which
now spans nothing but weeds.
Nearby is a boarded-up cave and
several old entrances to partially
built tunnels.
And on Escondido stands an old
wooden house, now occupied by Dr.
William C. Bark, which was named
Escondite (Hide-away) Cottage by
Dr. David Starr Jordan, who lived
there for two years before the Uni
versity president's home was com
pleted.
These are the historical remain
ders of Peter Coutts, the "mystery"
Frenchman who once owned 1,400
acres of land which he sold to Sen
ator Stanford for his University.
Fact and fable have constantly sur
rounded this Frenchman since his
fight-year stay here from 1874 to
1882.
Traveled Under Alias
Peter Coutts' real name was Pau
lin Caporone. He got his alias from
a cousin, the Viscount Peter Coutts
of Switzerland, from whom he ob
tained passports and identification
papers. He arrived in Mayfield by
train in 1874. bringing with him his
two children and their governess.
$>ome accounts say he also brought
his invalid wife. He bought 1.400
acres of land where Stanford now
}sand, calling it Ayreshire Farm
(after a breed of cattle), raised fine
cattle. In 1882 he returned to
France, taking his family with him.
Opposed Napoleon 111
Why Coutts left his native France
and came to this country under an
alias is not known for sure, but two
reasonable explanations have been
suggested. According to Mrs. Mar
guerite Berlin, his granddaughter,
he was forced to flee France after
opposing the policies of Napoleon
111. He was editor of the paper La
Liberte, in which he went so far
as to oppose France's entrance into
the Franco-Prussian War.
Another explanation offered is
that the mysterious Frenchman left
his country to avoid payment of
bank debts during the financial

panic which followed the fall of the
French army to Prussia.
While here the Frenchman, who
was very wealthy, developed an ex
tensive farm. He constructed sev
eral large red barns and other
buildings for his cows. He began
building a great irrigation system.
Included in this system were a
small artificial lake, several tunnels
which were never completed, some
small streams, a stone bridge, and
the old tower. There have been
many tales about the remains of the
tunnels, Frenchman's Cave, and the
tower, but they all apparently were
to be part of the immense water
system.
Legendary Tower
The most persistent rumors con
cern the tower. This doorless, cir
cular bricjt structure has been the
object of such legends as that he
built it for a hideout or a lookout.
If he had wanted a lookout, the
tower on the library was much bet
ter situated, and the hideout theory
has been generally discredited by
the few facts known about him. It
seems positive that the tower was
built to house a water tank.
On Escondido Road Coutts built
a chalet resembling Marie Antoi
nette's Petit Trianon in the forests
of Versailles. Across from this cot
tage he erected a tower which
housed his office and library, con
taining a collection of rare books.
Both these buildings still stand.
Coutts the man has also been the
subject of much talk, based both on
guesses and fact. Hp was appar
ently about 5 feet 7 inches tall,
weighed about 180 pounds, and was
broad - shouldered, white - haired,
and 64 years of age when he came
to California. He loved animals,
beauty, and France.
Mysterious Departure
Coutts and his family left Ayre
shire Farm in 1882 and were not
heard from here again. His leaving
was the subject of more mystery,
some accounts saying he fled in the
middle of the night or that he and
his family hid in a cave (now
Frenchman's Cave on Frenchman's
Hill) and, finding their exit blocked,
died there. However, it has been

established that they left in broad
daylight.
If Coutts left France for political
reasons, which he probably did,
then he most likely returned to
that country after being pardoned
by the successors of Napoleon Ill's
regime. According to his grand
daughter, he died in 1889, soon af
ter the death of his 14 - year - old
daughter.
Whatever the exact details of the
story of Paulin Caperone, his stay
here as Peter Coutts was not sur
rounded with as much mystery as
story-tellers at first made out. The
absurd tales of his purposes in
building the tower and of his dig
ging a hideout cave with his bare
hands are no longer told. Yet there
is still enough mystery about him,
and he left enough picturesque
beauty in the area which is now
Stanford, that he will never cease
to be the object of awe and wonder.


BYGONE LAKE—Now filled in is the area where this artificial lake built by Peter Coutts once
stood. It adjoins Frenchman's road between Mayfield and Foothill. He constructed it as part of
the immense water system he had planned to supply his large farm.


FRENCHMAN'S BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN—This bridge
didn't always span weeds as it does now. It was built by the
Frenchman over one of the small streams which ran through his
property and into his artificial lake. Nearby is the boarded-up
Frenchman's Cave and several mysterious tunnel entrances.

was the subject of more mystery,
some accounts saying he fled in the
middle of the night or that he and
his family hid in a cave (now
Frenchman's Cave on Frenchman's
Hill) and, finding their exit blocked,
died there. However, it has been

established that they left in broad
daylight.
If Coutts left France for political
reasons, which he probably did,
then he most likely returned to
that country after being pardoned
by the successors of Napoleon Ill's
regime. According to his grand
daughter, he died in 1889, soon af
ter the death of his 14 - year - old
daughter.
Whatever the exact details of the
story of Paulin Caperone, his stay
here as Peter Coutts was not sur
rounded with as much mystery as
story-tellers at first made out. The
absurd tales of his purposes in
building the tower and of his dig
ging a hideout cave with his bare
hands are no longer told. Yet there
is still enough mystery about him,
and he left enough picturesque
beauty in the area which is now
Stanford, that he will never cease
to be the object of awe and wonder.


BYGONE LAKE—Now filled in is the area where this artificial lake built by Peter Coutts once
stood. It adjoins Frenchman's road between Mayfield and Foothill. He constructed it as part of
the immense water system he had planned to supply his large farm.


FRENCHMAN'S BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN—This bridge
didn't always span weeds as it does now. It was built by the
Frenchman over one of the small streams which ran through his
property and into his artificial lake. Nearby is the boarded-up
Frenchman's Cave and several mysterious tunnel entrances.
An old brick tower stands on
Page Mill Road.
Beside Frenchman's Road there is
a picturesque stone bridge which
now spans nothing but weeds.
Nearby is a boarded-up cave and
several old entrances to partially
built tunnels.
And on Escondido stands an old
wooden house, now occupied by Dr.
William C. Bark, which was named
Escondite (Hide-away) Cottage by
Dr. David Starr Jordan, who lived
there for two years before the Uni
versity president's home was com
pleted.
These are the historical remain
ders of Peter Coutts, the "mystery"
Frenchman who once owned 1,400
acres of land which he sold to Sen
ator Stanford for his University.
Fact and fable have constantly sur
rounded this Frenchman since his
fight-year stay here from 1874 to
1882.
Traveled Under Alias
Peter Coutts' real name was Pau
lin Caporone. He got his alias from
a cousin, the Viscount Peter Coutts
of Switzerland, from whom he ob
tained passports and identification
papers. He arrived in Mayfield by
train in 1874. bringing with him his
two children and their governess.
$>ome accounts say he also brought
his invalid wife. He bought 1.400
acres of land where Stanford now
}sand, calling it Ayreshire Farm
(after a breed of cattle), raised fine
cattle. In 1882 he returned to
France, taking his family with him.
Opposed Napoleon 111
Why Coutts left his native France
and came to this country under an
alias is not known for sure, but two
reasonable explanations have been
suggested. According to Mrs. Mar
guerite Berlin, his granddaughter,
he was forced to flee France after
opposing the policies of Napoleon
111. He was editor of the paper La
Liberte, in which he went so far
as to oppose France's entrance into
the Franco-Prussian War.
Another explanation offered is
that the mysterious Frenchman left
his country to avoid payment of
bank debts during the financial

panic which followed the fall of the
French army to Prussia.
While here the Frenchman, who
was very wealthy, developed an ex
tensive farm. He constructed sev
eral large red barns and other
buildings for his cows. He began
building a great irrigation system.
Included in this system were a
small artificial lake, several tunnels
which were never completed, some
small streams, a stone bridge, and
the old tower. There have been
many tales about the remains of the
tunnels, Frenchman's Cave, and the
tower, but they all apparently were
to be part of the immense water
system.
Legendary Tower
The most persistent rumors con
cern the tower. This doorless, cir
cular bricjt structure has been the
object of such legends as that he
built it for a hideout or a lookout.
If he had wanted a lookout, the
tower on the library was much bet
ter situated, and the hideout theory
has been generally discredited by
the few facts known about him. It
seems positive that the tower was
built to house a water tank.
On Escondido Road Coutts built
a chalet resembling Marie Antoi
nette's Petit Trianon in the forests
of Versailles. Across from this cot
tage he erected a tower which
housed his office and library, con
taining a collection of rare books.
Both these buildings still stand.
Coutts the man has also been the
subject of much talk, based both on
guesses and fact. Hp was appar
ently about 5 feet 7 inches tall,
weighed about 180 pounds, and was
broad - shouldered, white - haired,
and 64 years of age when he came
to California. He loved animals,
beauty, and France.

eral large red barns and other
buildings for his cows. He began
building a great irrigation system.
Included in this system were a
small artificial lake, several tunnels
which were never completed, some
small streams, a stone bridge, and
the old tower. There have been
many tales about the remains of the
tunnels, Frenchman's Cave, and the
tower, but they all apparently were
to be part of the immense water
system.
Legendary Tower
The most persistent rumors con
cern the tower. This doorless, cir
cular bricjt structure has been the
object of such legends as that he
built it for a hideout or a lookout.
If he had wanted a lookout, the
tower on the library was much bet
ter situated, and the hideout theory
has been generally discredited by
the few facts known about him. It
seems positive that the tower was
built to house a water tank.
On Escondido Road Coutts built
a chalet resembling Marie Antoi
nette's Petit Trianon in the forests
of Versailles. Across from this cot
tage he erected a tower which
housed his office and library, con
taining a collection of rare books.
Both these buildings still stand.
Coutts the man has also been the
subject of much talk, based both on
guesses and fact. Hp was appar
ently about 5 feet 7 inches tall,
weighed about 180 pounds, and was
broad - shouldered, white - haired,
and 64 years of age when he came
to California. He loved animals,
beauty, and France.
Mysterious Departure
Coutts and his family left Ayre
shire Farm in 1882 and were not
heard from here again. His leaving
was the subject of more mystery,
some accounts saying he fled in the
middle of the night or that he and
his family hid in a cave (now
Frenchman's Cave on Frenchman's
Hill) and, finding their exit blocked,
died there. However, it has been

established that they left in broad
daylight.
If Coutts left France for political
reasons, which he probably did,
then he most likely returned to
that country after being pardoned
by the successors of Napoleon Ill's
regime. According to his grand
daughter, he died in 1889, soon af
ter the death of his 14 - year - old
daughter.
Whatever the exact details of the
story of Paulin Caperone, his stay
here as Peter Coutts was not sur
rounded with as much mystery as
story-tellers at first made out. The
absurd tales of his purposes in
building the tower and of his dig
ging a hideout cave with his bare
hands are no longer told. Yet there
is still enough mystery about him,
and he left enough picturesque
beauty in the area which is now
Stanford, that he will never cease
to be the object of awe and wonder.


BYGONE LAKE—Now filled in is the area where this artificial lake built by Peter Coutts once
stood. It adjoins Frenchman's road between Mayfield and Foothill. He constructed it as part of
the immense water system he had planned to supply his large farm.


FRENCHMAN'S BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN—This bridge
didn't always span weeds as it does now. It was built by the
Frenchman over one of the small streams which ran through his
property and into his artificial lake. Nearby is the boarded-up
Frenchman's Cave and several mysterious tunnel entrances.
An old brick tower stands on
Page Mill Road.
Beside Frenchman's Road there is
a picturesque stone bridge which
now spans nothing but weeds.
Nearby is a boarded-up cave and
several old entrances to partially
built tunnels.
And on Escondido stands an old
wooden house, now occupied by Dr.
William C. Bark, which was named
Escondite (Hide-away) Cottage by
Dr. David Starr Jordan, who lived
there for two years before the Uni
versity president's home was com
pleted.
These are the historical remain
ders of Peter Coutts, the "mystery"
Frenchman who once owned 1,400
acres of land which he sold to Sen
ator Stanford for his University.
Fact and fable have constantly sur
rounded this Frenchman since his
fight-year stay here from 1874 to
1882.
Traveled Under Alias
Peter Coutts' real name was Pau
lin Caporone. He got his alias from
a cousin, the Viscount Peter Coutts
of Switzerland, from whom he ob
tained passports and identification
papers. He arrived in Mayfield by
train in 1874. bringing with him his
two children and their governess.
$>ome accounts say he also brought
his invalid wife. He bought 1.400
acres of land where Stanford now
}sand, calling it Ayreshire Farm
(after a breed of cattle), raised fine
cattle. In 1882 he returned to
France, taking his family with him.
Opposed Napoleon 111
Why Coutts left his native France
and came to this country under an
alias is not known for sure, but two
reasonable explanations have been
suggested. According to Mrs. Mar
guerite Berlin, his granddaughter,
he was forced to flee France after
opposing the policies of Napoleon
111. He was editor of the paper La
Liberte, in which he went so far
as to oppose France's entrance into
the Franco-Prussian War.
Another explanation offered is
that the mysterious Frenchman left
his country to avoid payment of
bank debts during the financial

panic which followed the fall of the
French army to Prussia.
While here the Frenchman, who
was very wealthy, developed an ex
tensive farm. He constructed sev
eral large red barns and other
buildings for his cows. He began
