## Excom to Face Oath Question 
### 
Excom will come face to face with
the loyalty oath controversy tonight
as Representative Gil Jonas is ex
pected to submit some 40 petition
lists advocating addition of the fol
lowing proposition to the fall election
ballot:
"Academic freedom is a neces
sity in a democratic society. Dis
criminatory loyalty oaths in any
university or school are a direct in
fringement of academic freedom.
Although we actively oppose to
talitarianism in any form we be
lieve that the use of such oaths is
an employment of the methods of
totalitarianism itself. We believe
that such loyalty oaths arc an in
effective and unwise means of com
batting totalitarianism.
Therefore, be it resolved that
the ASSU condemn any discrimi
natory loyalty oath in a university
or school as a direct infringement
of academic freedom."
Should those signing the petition
number five per cent of the student
body or better, Excom will be obli
gated either to act 011 the question cr
submit it to Ihe voters in the foim
