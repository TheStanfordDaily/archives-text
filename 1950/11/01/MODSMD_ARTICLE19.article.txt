## Krauskopf Describes Volcanology 
### TOM NEVILLE 
Defining the "descriptive sci
ence" of volcanology, Dr. Kon
rad Krauskopf, last night's Tues
day Evening Series speaker,
told his audience that volcanoes
keep most of tiieir secrets to
themselves.
"It is a primitive science com
pared to something like electron
ics," he emphasized, "since most of
the significant data lie innaccessible
underground. You can't bring a
volcano into the laboratory."
Scientists like Dr. Krauskopf find
it difficult to discover "patterns of
behavior" or to draw geneaaliza
tions from the information which
can be derived from just looking at
a volcano. "There are many hy
potheses, but most arc not much
more than probabilities."
Mexican Volcano
The first part of the talk covered
Dr. Krauskopf's study of Paricutin
volcano in Mexico. Colored slides
revealed spectacular night shots of
fiery lava flows and smoky black
eruption clouds. Daylight pictures
showed huge foaming steam mists
arising from the crater.
The latter half of his lecture Dr.
Krauskopf devoted to slides of Jap
anese volcanoes, all of which were
dormant while he was there. One
photograph pictured a volcano that
at the end of the last century had
"blown one of its sides out." A mass
of debris was scattered over the
floor of an uninhabited valley. At
the time residents of Tokyo, one
hundred miles away, claimed they
heard the blast.
. . at Its Worst"
"This was a volcano at its worst,"
he remarked.
But there may be one valuable
service volcanoes perform for life
on earth. Dr. Krauskopf said that
the balance of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere is constantly being
reduced. If this were to go on for
300 years, all .life would vanish.
'The main gas which volcanoes
give off is carbon dioxide, thereby
re-establishing the necessary life
balance," he concluded. "Perhaps,
after all, they should be regarded
as beneficent spirits rather than evil
ones."
