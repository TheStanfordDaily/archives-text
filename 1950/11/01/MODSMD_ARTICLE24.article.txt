# U.S.-French Deadlock On Forces for Defense
## Agreement Expected Soon On German Troop Conflict 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 31. (UP)—The 12 North Atlantic Pact do
fense ministers postponed creation of a unified Western European
defense force tonight after France and the United States dead
locked on the issue of including German troops.
The military chiefs were hopeful, however, that the stalemate

would be only temporary and ,
would not delay establishment of a
strong land army, backed by a
powerful air and sea armada, to !
protect Western Europe from pos- j
siblc aggression.
U.S. Defense Secretary George
C. Marshall said he hoped agree
ment on the German issue could
be reached in a "very few weeks."
But he said the United States is
insisting: on a "realistic" defense
plan and the question "has to be
settled."
President Truman is expected to i
appoint Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower ,
as supreme commander once the i
pact leaders settle their differences. I
The defense ministers, who have !
been meeting here for the past three
days, referred the German question !
back to its military committee and
the Council of Deputies for a re- !
newed settlement effort. The two ;
groups met separately tonight and I
may meet jointly tomorrow.
While in disagreement on Ger
many, the defense chiefs did agree
on the size and type of military
forces to be provided by each of the
Western democracies. These rec
ommendations will be submitted to !
the Council of Foreign Ministers
and then to the individual govern
ments.
No details were made public,
but informed sources have said
the unified force will consist of
about 50 ground divisions, com
pared with the 180 Russia is able
to muster in the. West, supported
by powerful navy fleets and a
huge air armada.
The fleets would be based in the >
Atlantic and the Mediterranean. !
Strong air bases would be estab
lished both in Britain and on the ;
continent. French support is essen
tial since they will supply by far

the largest share of the propose!
! ground forces.
The United States would supply
j large naval units and would bo ul
most wholly responsible for si rate
j gic bombing. Britain also would
provide important fleet units and
| tactical air support. Other pat I.
: members would contribute land
forces and specialized units to th<
! limit of their ability.
French opposition to including
German troops in the combined
force stems from that country':
traditional fear of Germany. The
United States believes, however,
that strategic considerations, in
; ch'Hing Russia's huge reservoir of
j manpower, override any such con
siderations.


GEN. EISENHOWER
—may lead Western forces
