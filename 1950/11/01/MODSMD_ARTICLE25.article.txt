## Local Chapter Wins Fight To End Anti-Negro Clause 
### WALT MENNINGER 
Culminating a three-year campaign, the Stanford chapter of the
Phi Alpha Delta legal fraternity has won the battle for removal of
an anti-Negro clause from its national membership qualifications,
Bill Keogh, local chapter president, said yesterday.
The national charter of the social-professional fraternity pre

viously restricted membership to i
"Caucasian males," and was only I
revised at the September national |
convention under pressure from j
Palo Alto.
The Stanford chapter's campaign
consisted in organizing favorable [
sentiment in prc-convcntion meet- j
ings, and, according to delegates i
Irving JafTe and Gene Cannon, '
careful planning and persuasive ap- j
peals on the convention oflor.
As a result, sufficient support
was rallied to have the clause re
moved. Included in tliis support
were a few Southern chapters
which were persuaded to join the
anti-discrimination group.
"This action becomes even more
significant in light of the recent
flare-up against a fraternity dis- !
crimination clause by the Univer
sity of Connecticut's Phi Epsilon Pi
social fraternity," said President ;
Kcogh.
"Our local chapter of Phi Alpha j
Delta," commented Kcogh. "does |
not have a living group, and there- :
by would not be affected by the j
action as would other social frater
nities. However, some of the 72
affiliated PAD chapters do run
houses."
The original reform movement |
was started here several years
ago by Law School students
George Brunn, Melvin Swift, and
Warren Christopher, who is now
law secretary to Supreme Court
Justice William (). Douglas.
Their proposal was discussed and
bitterly contested at the 1948 na
tional convention before being de
feated, largely by the Southern
chapters.
Following that convention,
many Stanford members were in
favor of going inactive- or dissas
sociating from the national chap
ter. Yet on the premise that bet
ter results could he achieved h.v
challenging the discriminatory
clause within the national organ
ization. rather than by threaten
ing secession, the local chapter
remained active.
In preparation for this last
month's national convention, the
Stanford chapter, rallied during the

summer session by Marshall Small
and Norman Coliver, held several
meetings, raised extra funds, and
contacted other chapters.
"It would seem then," said Col
ivcr when questioned, "that it is
a more positive approach to work
in the organization with con
structive arguments to change the
viewpoints of those who disagree
on questions of discrimination."
However, as pointed out l>y i
Law School student, the Stanford
Law School at present has no Negro
students. This situation is not. due
to discrimination, for applications
in no way reveal racial or religion',
affiliations, and in many cases no
interviews are held.
One of the Phi Alpha Delta mem
hers explained. "Negro studrnl -
just haven't applied to the school
Possibly they mistakenly believe
they won't be accepted bccausc of
their color."
