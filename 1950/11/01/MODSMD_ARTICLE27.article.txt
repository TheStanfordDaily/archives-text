# Legal Fraternity Leads the Way
## 
### 
Racial discrimination among both social and
honorary fraternities has made headlines in col
lege newspapers throughout the nation during
the past month or two. Leading one of the cam
paigns for abolishing discriminatory constitu
tions has been the Stanford chapter of Phi
Alpha Delta, en honorary-professional legal fra
ternity.
Dae to the group's praiseworthy and success
ful efforts this summer, the national Phi Alpha
Delta fraternity now has no restrictions on race,
color, or creed.
Significantly, the local chapter's action sug
gests a point often overlooked by fraternities in
general when they seek racial equality within
their ranks.
This concept relates specifically to the meth
ods adopted in achieving the goal of non-dis
crimination. The Stanford law fraternity, after
losing the argument when it was first discussed
at a national convention two years ago, almost
tipped the boat by seceding from the national
organization.
Nothing would have been gained by such ac
tion. Discrimination is something which cannot
be fought when you yourself are outside the
select group. Immediately you are labeled
"one of those cranks."
A crusader must retain his identity within the
circle and concentrate his efforts on challeng
ing, arguing, and tearing down opposing theo
ries:

The value of this approach is illustrated by
the Phi Alpha Delta campaign which was ac
cepted by chapters throughout the nation, in
cluding those in the deep South.
The problem of racial discrimination appears
to be sweeping all parts of the United States,
and it also seems likely that the battle may be
decided in colleges, fraternities, and other edu
cational organizations.
For if the Negro striving for education and a
chance to lead his race and others is not ac
cepted, non-discriminatory action cannot be ex
pected to extend to the large share of the popu
lace which some have classified as "followers."
Stanford, by virtue of a recent report to the
NAACP announcing that all Negroes who ap
plied to Stanford this year were accepted, takes
its place as one of the liberal leaders in the
move for racial equality.
The action of the law fraternity at Stanford
emphasizes this trend, and it is plausible and
certainly desirable for other groups to help
minority races receive recognition on college
campuses.
As we have mentioned, the successful move
will not come from stubborn secession or with
drawals from national organizations or fraternal
chapters, but rather from discussion and cam
paigning on the part of those who seek changes
within the fold.
