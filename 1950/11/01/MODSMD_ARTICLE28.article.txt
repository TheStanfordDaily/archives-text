# BULL SESSION
## 
### AL BERRY 
As of Friday the Row Houses will begin to break out
i:ito a rash of Homecoming house decorations, indus
triously carved out of the fetid imaginations of campus.
In order that Bull Session may present another first in
the field ol journalism, today we will «dve a "reviey

of what you will see as you make
your pilgrimage down the Row
this weekend.
First of all, my tong—the Sigma
l.ouies—is composed of highly in
dustrious, hard-wdrking, and me
i hanically magnificent chaps, and
after much nocturnal diplomacy in
the orange fields south of San
Joje, they have assembled no less
than 57 smudge pots.

These, placed in ragged rows on the front lawn and
: iinultaneously fired will, it is believed, effectively
black out the front of the house. A small sign in front
of the pots will simply proclaim: "Los Angeles City
Limits."
The fact that a daytime blackout may occur in the
area * xtending from Mills College to Victorville, and
the (act that everything and every building within
this insignificant area will be the dyed and dismal
(uloi of a mule's bedroom, has been seriously con
tidered. But after all, this is homecoming at Stee-an
tord-dee.
The Delta Kappa Whoopsilons have come up with
what we think is one of the more novel ideas. They
plan < n planting their numerous pledges in the front
lawn with only their heads protruding. The pledges
will be buried in the form of a gigantic "S." Between
the heads, and over the heads, keeping the "J5" pat
ti/n, thy will pour honey. Then several million red
ants will be loosed. It is believed that the ants will
follow the'pattern on the honey, this presenting a con
stantly moving "S."
It should, at least, present an interesting time and
motion study.
The firmly planted and rapidly diminishing pledges
will add a service to the school, other than that of sheer

beauty. They will give time checks every 15 minutes
during the day.
The Phi Belt House will, we are told, attempt to win
the "theme" prize. The theme, in case somebody is
interested, is "The Indian and the Odyssey." From a
rock pile on their front lawn—they intend to add a
half dozen or so rocks to their already splendid col
lection—they will place a half dozen or so carefully
rented harpies. These young ladies will, at regular
intervals during the day, descend from the -rocks and
attempt to lure any and all males who bear lesem
blance to a Greek. 0
Many of you have no doubt wondered why the gurls
at Stirey House have been painting their front lawn a
bright blue. This is to signify the ocean that Ulysses
and his men had to cross after the sack of Troy.
In the middle ot the lawn (i.e., ocean) a wonderfully
modern touch will be added with the appearance of a
giant periscope. The submarine, supposedly manned
by the wrathful God of the Seas, will shoot water bags
through a cleverly rigged trap door at all those non-
Gieeks who are rejected by the harpies at the Phi
Belt House.
There is another house, the name escapes me, which
is building a boat with a dart board constructed on
the side. Rumors have it that they intend to put both
Marchie and Jefl Cravath together in thv same boat.
At the Fuju House, where they are wondering what
John Motheral did with his pin, they intend to build
a track field. Ten of their pledges, cleverly disguised
as Trojans, will compete with Bob Mitheris, and of
course be trounced, in the old Greek decathlon-game.
The interesting twist to this is that the eleventh
Trojan will be a banjo player who will accompany
the whole proceedings with "The World Is Waiting
for the Sunrise," followed by "Where Oh Where Has
My Little Dog Gone."
At Lateroump House, the girls all plan to appear on
their balcony, reading Homer (the theme), anil dressed
in their best Shakespearean attire. They will then
attempt to make like Juliet to the thoroughly drenched
rejects from Stirey and Phi Belt.
See ya Friday in front of the rockpile.

At the Fuju House, where they are wondering what
John Motheral did with his pin, they intend to build
a track field. Ten of their pledges, cleverly disguised
as Trojans, will compete with Bob Mitheris, and of
course be trounced, in the old Greek decathlon-game.
The interesting twist to this is that the eleventh
Trojan will be a banjo player who will accompany
the whole proceedings with "The World Is Waiting
for the Sunrise," followed by "Where Oh Where Has
My Little Dog Gone."
At Lateroump House, the girls all plan to appear on
their balcony, reading Homer (the theme), anil dressed
in their best Shakespearean attire. They will then
attempt to make like Juliet to the thoroughly drenched
rejects from Stirey and Phi Belt.
See ya Friday in front of the rockpile.

As of Friday the Row Houses will begin to break out
i:ito a rash of Homecoming house decorations, indus
triously carved out of the fetid imaginations of campus.
In order that Bull Session may present another first in
the field ol journalism, today we will «dve a "reviey

of what you will see as you make
your pilgrimage down the Row
this weekend.
First of all, my tong—the Sigma
l.ouies—is composed of highly in
dustrious, hard-wdrking, and me
i hanically magnificent chaps, and
after much nocturnal diplomacy in
the orange fields south of San
Joje, they have assembled no less
than 57 smudge pots.

These, placed in ragged rows on the front lawn and
: iinultaneously fired will, it is believed, effectively
black out the front of the house. A small sign in front
of the pots will simply proclaim: "Los Angeles City
Limits."
The fact that a daytime blackout may occur in the
area * xtending from Mills College to Victorville, and
the (act that everything and every building within
this insignificant area will be the dyed and dismal
(uloi of a mule's bedroom, has been seriously con
tidered. But after all, this is homecoming at Stee-an
tord-dee.
The Delta Kappa Whoopsilons have come up with
what we think is one of the more novel ideas. They
plan < n planting their numerous pledges in the front
lawn with only their heads protruding. The pledges
will be buried in the form of a gigantic "S." Between
the heads, and over the heads, keeping the "J5" pat
ti/n, thy will pour honey. Then several million red
ants will be loosed. It is believed that the ants will
follow the'pattern on the honey, this presenting a con
stantly moving "S."
It should, at least, present an interesting time and
motion study.
The firmly planted and rapidly diminishing pledges
will add a service to the school, other than that of sheer

beauty. They will give time checks every 15 minutes
during the day.
The Phi Belt House will, we are told, attempt to win
the "theme" prize. The theme, in case somebody is
interested, is "The Indian and the Odyssey." From a
rock pile on their front lawn—they intend to add a
half dozen or so rocks to their already splendid col
lection—they will place a half dozen or so carefully
rented harpies. These young ladies will, at regular
intervals during the day, descend from the -rocks and
attempt to lure any and all males who bear lesem
blance to a Greek. 0
Many of you have no doubt wondered why the gurls
at Stirey House have been painting their front lawn a
bright blue. This is to signify the ocean that Ulysses
and his men had to cross after the sack of Troy.
In the middle ot the lawn (i.e., ocean) a wonderfully
modern touch will be added with the appearance of a
giant periscope. The submarine, supposedly manned
by the wrathful God of the Seas, will shoot water bags
through a cleverly rigged trap door at all those non-
Gieeks who are rejected by the harpies at the Phi
Belt House.
There is another house, the name escapes me, which
is building a boat with a dart board constructed on
the side. Rumors have it that they intend to put both
Marchie and Jefl Cravath together in thv same boat.
