# Proposition 6—Legalized Gambling
## 
### CORNELIA LITTLE Political Editor, The Daily 
T he authors of this initiative constitutional amend
ment ( all it the "Pensions and Welfare Funding Act."
And its first provision is to provide that the revenue
it raises is to go into a fund for old age and blind pen
sions.
The"Attorney General gives it the title of a measure
"legalizing and Licensing Gambling."
The chairman of the State Board of Equalization,
George R. Reilly, goes so far as to dub it: "An Act to
lv tahlish a Gambling Monopoly in California."
So perhaps we'd better just refer to it as Proposition
another one of the measures that will face Cali
fornia vot' rs Tuesday.
What the act does is to set up a state commission to
license, supervise, and "in its discretion" operate
gambling establishments of all kinds, except for horse
racing which is already covered by the California
Horse Racing Law. The measure sets up the license
fees and the percentages that will go to the state and
to the pension and welfare fund.
The first objection, of course, is that of the people
who are agin' sin. To them, the proponents of the
bill reply that gambling has never been successfully
outlawed, and that at present bookmakers and gam
blers in ••ffect operate tax-free, while necessities are
taxed instead.
The next argument is probably more serious; it is
that of the people who point to the structure of the
proposed commission. The first five commissioners
arc named in the amendment they are the five pro-

moters of the initiative—and they are given unlimited
power over gambling; $10,000 salaries; a large budget
(up to 5 per cent of an estimated take of $350,000,000
a year, or $17,500,000); and power to hire a staff with
out civil service regulations, this staff to include what
the bill's opponents call a secret police organization.
You could call this "undesirable administrative prac
tices," as does the San Francisco League of Women
Voters, or you could even go so far as to call it dicta
torial, a racket itself, and a scheme that would open
California to other racketeers as well. That's the kind
of names that most other prominent individuals and
groups within the state, have been calling it.
On the same ballot with this Proposition 6, which
names its first five commissioners, is an assembly
originated constitutional amendment which would
prohibit any amendment or law which named an indi
vidual to an office. That's Proposition 2. Another
measure in this general field is Proposition 5, a senate
constitutional amendment which says that Senators or
Assemblymen may serve on boards or commissions
"created to apportion or allocate state, funds to other
state or local agencies."
The Constitution specifies now that no member of
the legislature may during his term of office accept
any other state office except the one to which he is
elected. Previously, such boards and commissioners
often have legislators as advisers; this would allow
legislators to be voting members of these boards. Both
proponents and opponents of the measure claim the
separation of executive and legislative branches on
their side, the proponents maintaining that allocation
of state funds* is a legislative function.
