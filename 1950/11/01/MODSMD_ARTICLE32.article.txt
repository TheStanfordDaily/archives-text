## 
### 
A report on the Washington con
vention of Student World Federal
ists, which provided for new func
tions oi the organization, was given
at Monday night's meeting of the
Stanford chapter.
â€¢ The report from the Washington
convention restated the present be
liefs of student federalist that the
best way to sell democracy to the
world is through world government.
It was agreed that in view of the
present world crisis, now is the
time that governments would be
I ready to accept proposals for a
world government.
The Stanford delegation was pri
j marily impressed by the enthusiasm
of students from all over the coun
try, who discussed proposals for the
UWF stand for five days and five
1 nights without rest.
Changes in the organization and
function of the Student World Fed
eralists, formulated during their
national convention in Washington,
D.C., were their main concern.
On the student level, the new
I structure provides for real integra
tion with the adult division and es
tablishes former student chapters
on the same level as adult ones, the
Stanford delegation reported.
Nationally, the UWF has more
completely accepted its responsibil
ity to work through the United Na
tions by supporting American for
eign policy, the chapter announced.
Although hardly known on the
West Coast, the prestige of UWF in
Washington has grown greatly and
it is now considered the most im
i portant and effective foreign policy
| organization in the country, accord
| ing to the Stanford chapter. The
1 State Department now depends on
i UWF for aid and advice.
