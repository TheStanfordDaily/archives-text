# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry

OK, the Washington game.
At least we learned something from running into the buzz saw of the
great Northland. The main reason they beat us, in case no one has noticed,
is that the well-fed, and well-paid northmen simply had a
better football team than we did.
The more curious of you may wonder why. Wouldn't it be fun if 1 knew?
Technically, here is part of the reason.
First of all, Bill McColl, Harry Hugasian, and Bobby White have been
overworked, each putting in on the far side of 50 minutes against the
Huskies. The lads are healthy, but they aren't healthy enough to go the
distance and still compare favorably to men nearly as good as they are
who are fresh and fully rested.
Take, for example, Hugh ''My leg hurts me because the going is ruff" Mc-
Elhenny. After a nice 30-yard runback of a punt, Big Hugh simply took
himself out of the game for a breather. It's fine, but it gives him a decided
edge on the likes of Hugasian and White who have been breaking their necks
for 45 minutes or so.
This trouble will be cured to the best of our manpower ability next Satur
day vs. the Trojans. The Red Shirts will play straight platoon system foot
ball, with Hugasian, White, McColl, and Manoogian playing offense only.
This, probably, will do severe damage to our fine defense, but the coaches
hope that the gained ball control will more than make up for the weakening
of the defensive club.
And—if the gods are willing—the defensive club won't be too mangled.
Dick Horn, Blondy Broome, and Bill Storum will take over the defensive
backfield duties —providing Bruce Vpn Alstyne can go the distance on of
fense. If not, a replacement for Storum must be discovered, so he can play
offensive end. If Eric Southwood can shake.his somewhat painful groin
injury, he will see much action at defensive safety.
But back to the Washington game. Our big—and perhaps our only—
trouble was in the deficiency of our ground game. We not only didn't
have an effective land attack, we didn't even have the threa: of an ef
fective land attack.
This in turn murdered our passing game. Heinrich looked superb passing
short bullet-jobs. Gary Kerkorian looked mediocre pitching long. Admit
ting that Heinrich is a better qb than Gary, he isn't that much better a passer.
The difference is in the length of the passes.
"Well, why," asks the logical mind, "didn't we pass short passes?"
A good question, even if I did pose it myself. The reason is that we
couldn't.
With no threat of a ground attack, the Huskies played us for passing—
especially short passing. Kerkorian and Shaw couldn't throw short because
the short man was either always covered, or there was one of the Huskies'
four or five line backers in the path of the ball. A short pass, of necessity,
has to be a fairly low bullet. If someone is between the passer and the re
ceiver, the ball will either be intercepted (a disagreeable thing) or knocked
down (likewise disagreeable).
The quarterbacks passed long, then, with only a moderate degree of suc
cess.
Why could Heinrich pass short? Easy. We couldn't play for his passing
attack because the linebackers had their hands crowded with the thundering
ground game of Kirkby, Earley, and What'shisname.
Now we go for $64. Why no ground game. This one is easy to diagnose,
difficult to correct. First of all, as mentioned, our best offensive backs—
White and Hugasian—were tired from too much football against fresh
men. Thai's not all of it.
The big bind was that our offensive line wasn't able to open holes in the
Husky (and in the second half, Bruin) lines. The platoon system to be used
against the Trojans Saturday is an attempt at a solution, although the only
position being really strengthened is one of the guards With the addition of
Norm Manoogian. We are still weak at tackles offensively, and will be until
the present lads we have improve enough to make us strong there. There is,
at this point, little hope of Pomeroy and White coming back into the offen
sive lineup. Pomeroy, injured, is too good a line backer (easily one of the
three best in the country) to put on offense, and it looks very much like
Tex White will be nursing his ankle until Big Game time.
I have two predictions this week. Don't bet on either. Washington to
the Rose Bowl by 14 points over California. Stanford to the victor's
circle by 7 points over Jeff Cravath's hapless Trojans.
