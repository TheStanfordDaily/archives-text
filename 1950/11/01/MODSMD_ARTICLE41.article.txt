# McColl, White, Hugasian Allowed Rest in SC Game
## 
### 
Coach Marchie Schwartz con
firmed yesterday the earlier report
that Stanford's grid Indians, who
host USC this Saturday, will bow
to the exigencies of modern foot
ball by adopting the platoon sys
tem for their remaining games this
season.
"Looking at the pictures of the
Washington game convinced me of
the necessity of the change,"
Schwartz said. "For example, Harry
Hugasian and Bob White were defi
nitely faltering in the latter stages
at plays they used to execute beau
tifully.
"Bill McColl must have run 200
yards on offense—leading pass pat
terns, decoying, and so on; it's too
much to ask him to play a full game
at defense, too."
While present plans call for a 22-
man offensive unit and a separate
defensive corps of the same size,
the Cards' manpower shortage will
force some doubling-up of duties.
Dick Horn, heretofore a strict of
fensive specialist, will be called on
for safety work. So will Gary Ker

korian, but the top offensive quar
terback will also perform at eithrr ,
defensive h 3 'fback when needed.
Others who are slated for some !
defensive duty, though officially |
members of the offensive platoon, !
are such men as Hugasian, Bob
Bryan, McColl, and Bob White; but
their use as defenders is expected
to be limited.
