# Excom Votes To Reject Oath Petition
## 
### 
Excom needed a bigger room
last night. At least 60 persons—
including 15 Excom members—
crammed Stanford's ASSU con
ference room to hash out Rep
resentative Gil Jonas' petition
signed by 400 students advocat
ing submission of the loyalty
oath to a vote of the students.
When it was all over, 11 of Ex
com's 12 voitng members decided
against Jonas' petition. Only its
initiator voted yes.
Then everyone — except the Ex
comers (who probably wanted to) —
walked out.
Actually, what the motion meant
was that the whole matter of the
petition as an official action was
outside ASSU's authority. And the

Positive action on the loyalty
oath controversy in another di
rection was taken by Excom last
night when members passed the
following motion submitted by
Representative Ed Fleischer:
"A special committee of three
members from the student body
at larjge (not Excom members) be
appointed to supervise and co-or
dinate the discussion, statement,
and publication of the issues in
volved in a loyalty oath for the
specific purpose of supplying in
formation to the student body." i

representatives, in a closed session I
following the open debate, put this !
contention down in black and white
when they passed the following j
motion, submitted by Phil Saeta: I
. . the petition for referendum
is not a matter for referendum 1
ballot as it is not within the scope
of this association's authority as i
set down in the ASSU constitu
tion. . .
Earlier in the meeting, Buttner
cited Dean of Students Donald Win
bigler, who said the Academic
Council of the faculty has felt it in
appropriate to take a stand on what
amounted to an internal issue at
the University of California.
In csscnce, Buttner put the self
same question before Excom last
night, and he got a variety of an
swers.
Four Excom members — repre
sentatives of the Villace, senior
and junior classes, and the Wom
en's Row—said their constitucn- |
cics were not in favor of puiting j
the loyalty oath to a vote of the
student body.
Jonas, who was supported by Al
berta Engvall, an interested stu
dent, contended that the petition
asking for a referendum was within
the scope of Excom's powers.
Miss Engvall said Columbia
University, Harvard, and the
University of Chicago had all i
conie out against the oath, and
that "it is to deny a function of i

government — even student gov
ernment—not to take a stand on
such an issue,"
On the opposing side, Jim Jen
nings, another student speaking
from the floor, said any ASSU con
demnation of the loyalty oath would
not only "go against" a compromise
dictum on the matter by the Cal
alumni last spring, but would also
hinder future endowments to Stan
ford.
Representatives clarified the point
that any number of students can
sign their own petitions opposing
the oath and go on record as such.
