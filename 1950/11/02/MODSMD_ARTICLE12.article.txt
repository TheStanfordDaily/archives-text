# G.B. Shaw, Irish Playwright Dies At Home At Age of 94
## Shaw Believed to Have Chosen Death To Life as Invalid; Great Era Ends 
### 
AYOT ST. LAWRENCE, England, Thursday, Nov. 2 (UP) —
George Bernard Shaw, one of the greatest playwrights of all time,
died early today at the age of 94.
The long and incredible drama of his life came to its close in
his red brick Victorian mansion, "Shaw's Corners," some seven

weeks after he slipped on the pebbly
border of his garden and fractured
"his thieh.
His housekeeper, Mrs. Alice Ladon
came to the gate and told waiting
newsmen "Shaw is dead."
She said death came at 4:59 a.m.
(11:50 p.m. Wednesday, EST).
Ironically it was not the fracture
suffered Sept. 11 that caused his
death. Astounding his doctors,
Shaw's "brittle bones," as he called
them, knit perfectly after an opera
tion despite his great age.
But the shock of his fall stirred
into fatal activity a latent kidney
bladder injection that might other
wise have lain dormant for years.
Alter an operation on his thigh he
underwent two operations for his
kidney bladder. With the infection
and its discomfort went much of the
indomitable will to live that carried
Shaw through the earlier crises in his
career.
Although he was never told, he
knew even in the hospital that he
could exist only as an invalid, un
able to walk. lie complained to
visitors, among them American
born Lady Astor, that he would
rather die than have to he carried
about his beloved Hertfordshire
countryside.
Shaw's breathing became heavier
during the night, and more labored.
It stopped finally after he had been
unconscious for 26 hours. Shaw had
hoped to live to be 100, but his death
came at 94 when many considered
him still to be near his prime. He was
writing a play when the accident oc
curred.
After his death t'le light that had
burned night long in his room was
switched off.
Shaw could have afforded any spe
cialist in the land, but he preferred
Dr. Thomas C. Probyn and the stafT
of Luton Dunstable Hospital and he
congratulated them on keeping him
alive as long as they did,
"I am old and fragile," he said, "and
a little puff of wind can blow out the
old flame."
Virtually to the very end, Shaw
retained the sharp tongue and ready
wit which made him one of the most
celebrated and certainly the most dis
cussed author and playwright of the
century.
Soon after his arrival at the hos
pital for the operation on his frac
tured thighbone, the Irish-born sage
snapped at his young nurse as she
sponged him:
"The nursing profession rcckons to
kill its patients by washing them."
Shaw alternately shocked and de
lighted the world with his perverse
opinions on every subject under the
sun for nearly three-quarters of a
century.
"I am an Irishman, a vegetarian,
an atheist, a teetotaller, a fanatic, a
humorist, a fluent liar, a Social
Democrat, a lecturer and debater,
a lover of music, a fierce opponent
of the present status of women, and
an insistcr on the seriousness of
art." That was how Shaw once
summed himself up.
