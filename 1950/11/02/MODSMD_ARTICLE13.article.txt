# NEW UNION
## Planning Com Has No Voice, Says Report 
### 
The ASSU Union Planning Com
mittee should be abandoned be
cause of the lack of co-operation
given it by the Administration, ac
cording to the committee's report
outlined to Excom last night.
The recommendation was made
by Dan Stone, chairman of the Un
ion Planning Committee last year. I
Stone wrote that his committee
had the most trouble in getting the j
co-operation of the University Di
rector of Planning, Eldridge T. !
Spencer. He recommended that the
committee be abandoned and the |
problem be given the personal at
tention of the ASSU president.
Stone did not criticize the Presi
dent's office or the Dean of Stu
dents. He said he believed Presi- !
dent Wallace Sterling was sympa- â– 
thetic to the "cause of the union" !
and that he would give considera
tion to the student side of the ques
tion. Former Dean Lawrence A. !
Kimpton was "constantly offering
friendly and helpful advice," Stone
wrote.
Reports Disinterest
Stone wrote in his report:
"The most difficult task in work
ing on the Tresiddcr Union was in
the relations with the office of Mr. j
Spencer, the University 'Director of
Planning.' . . .
"Mr. Spcncer and his office at all
times were courteous and willing
to listen to problems that arose; ,
but he was never able to give a
definite answer, nor could he be
countcd on to produce of his own
volition any plans or drawings, even j
if promised."
Stone further said that he could J
obtain from the University no defi- '
nite master plan into which the !
proposed Union could fit. Instead, !
he said, there was only a planning
report on ideas, and he could not j
get access to these, although he i
knew that parts of these were in
the hands of various engineering !
students.
Ceased to Serve Function
He said he was prepared to make j
an issue of this point, but kept
quiet at the request of Student
Manager John Lilienthal and ASSU
President Hank Rosin. Since the
Union Planning Commission did not
have a voice in the planning, but
could only listen to what the Ad
ministration told it, Stone said, it
had ceased to serve its function.
Student Manager Dave Elliott
told Excom that the actual building
was a long way off, and was in the
hands of a Board of Trustees' Un
ion committee. He said students
can be called upon by this commit
tee to present their point of view, j
and that it was the suggestion of
former ASSU President Rosin that
the ASSU be represented on the |
committee.
It was Rosin's desire also that the
student body be kept fully informed
as to the progress of the Union ,
planning, since $1 per student per
quarter is going to finance the pro.j- I
ect. Elliott said $250,000 of a neces
sary one million dollars had been j
collected for the Union, indicating j
that actual construction is still a
long way off.
