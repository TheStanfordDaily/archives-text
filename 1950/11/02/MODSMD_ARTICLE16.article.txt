### 
FLUSHING, N.Y., Nov. 1 (UP)
The United Nat ions General As
sembly today extended Trygve Lie's
term as Secretary-General for three
years in the face of a Russian threat
that it "will not deal with him."
The vote was 46 in favor, the fiva
riation Soviet bloc against, and eight,
abstentions (six Arab states plus
China and Australia).
Russia had vetoed re-election of
Lie and the United States had
threatened to veto anyone else;.
Lie, who had remained discreetly
absent during the day and a half of
debate, returned after his over
whelming vote of confidence to .say:
"There must be steady, persist
ent, continuous effort to brine about
a reconciliation, one by one, of the
conflicting interests that divide tlv:
world. I have worked hard during
the last five years for conciliation
of these conflicting interests. I shall
continue to do so."
The one-time Norwegian Foreign
Minister indirectly reaffirmed his
support of UN action against Korea
—the action that apparently pre
cipitated Russia's veto and Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vj
shinsky's denunciation of him as
"one - sided," "two - faced," and a
"stooge" of the United States.
Vishinsky announced at a new:,
confcrence Monday, and repeated
to the Assembly Tuesday, 'that in
case Lie is continued in any term,
Russia will not deal with him and
will not recognize him as Secretary-
General of the UN." But he made
clear to newsmen that Russia had
no intention of walking out of the
UN.
