# Farm Won't Appeal Fees
## 
### 
Business Manager Alf Brandin
said yesterday that Stanford will
i not appeal a Santa Clara County
| ruling issued earlier this week re
quiring the University to pay build
ing fees, "if it is official."
Brandin said he had received no
definite word on County Counsel
1 Howard W. Campen's statement last
j Monday to the effect that, even
| though Stanford is an educational
I institution and maintains a corps of
j engineers and architects, it must be
considered just like any other coun
ty school or business firm.
University officials previously had
! asked the Board of Supervisors to
I exempt the school from filing con
struction fees. lliey maintained
j that Stanford has a staff of highly
' skilled engineers capable of pre
paring and executing any type of
j building plan up to standard.
Catnpcn told the board. "I can
find no reason why we should re
lieve Stanford University any more
1 than any large corporation that has
| a staff of engineers."
The building fees issue has been
hanging in the balance for at least
four months, Brandin said yester
day. At first, he indicated, a county
official had exempted the Univer
sity from paying fees for all gen
eral contracting but had specified
payment for all subcontracting
| work.
However, the business manager
j said, more recently "the county in
formed us that this ruling was un
official, and that we would have to
; pay inspectors' fees for all building
' w;Â»i k on the campus."
That's when the real argument
! started. If Counsel Campen's words
I last Monday can betaken as final,
j the University will* have lost the
I battle.
