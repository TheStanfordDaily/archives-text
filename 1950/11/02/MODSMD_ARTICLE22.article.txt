						Tight Ticket Problem
## 
### 
The distribution of Big Game tickets is al
ways a sore spot during football season, espe
cially when alumni start getting rejection
notices on their applications for the priceless
ducats.
Each year the problem increases proportion
ately with the number of alumni, Buck of the
Month Club members, Block S men, and fac
ulty. Unfortunately the amount of space in both
Berkeley and Stanford Stadiums remains con
stant.
To set up the fairest system possible, the Ath
letic Council, after consultation with the
Alumni Association last year, divided the avail
able tickets into six categories according to the
status of each ticket-seeker.
Life members and annual members of the
Alumni Association are included in Class 6A
and 68. They obtain application blanks about
the middle of July, and are given until Sept. 1
to return the blank and money.
However by the last of July all the tickets set
aside for alumni were sold, and some people
missed out. Money was refunded to these
people last week, and of course many plans
had to be changed and reservations cancelled.
The Athletic Department, we feel, is han
dling the ticket situation the best way possible
under the present situation. No alumnus was
promised or "assured" as Mr. Drake said, of a

ticket by either the Department of Athletics or
the Alumni Association.
Alumni Director Jack Shoup emphasized the
fact that tickets are not guaranteed for alumni,
although they do have priority in obtaining ap
plications for tickets.
Another misconception in the minds of some
alumni was caused when some persons in the
first five ticket classifications received their
tickets although their applications were sub
mitted nearly a month after the alumni appli
cations.
This can be explained by the fact that Big
Game tickets for the first five classes are actu
ally mailed before any of the alumni tickets are
considered. Hence the competition is not be
tween alumni and Block "S," Buck of the Month
members, or Stadium subscribers, but rather
among alumni in the same group.
Although there is criticism aimed at the
ticket distribution to those within the six classi
fications, there should be nothing but commen
dation for the Athletic Department's handling
of the 1000 tickets placed on sale for parents of
Stanford students who could not apply for the
valuable ducats under any other category.
Stanford's public relations were improved
considerably this fall as the parents received
prompt attention from the BAC ticket depart
ment.
