# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
Something tells me we've lost a couple of ball games
. . . at least I notice every Cellar dweller I know has
.suddenly turned into an authority on football. You
can't share your breakfast with the bees any more
without hearing some redhot explain what's wrong

with Stanford's team in ten or fif
teen thousand ill-chosen words
. . . as if they knew a single wing
from a biplane.
Well, I got news for these
gnomes who think the answer to
Stanford's grid troubles is to jack
up the coaching staff and slide a
ntw one under it. . . . I'll tell you
how the Big Red lost its chance.

It was a dark day for Stanford that bleak September
afternoon when they cut Crazylegs Palmieri from the
i quad. I remember the assistant manager posting the
cut list and laughing as he pointed out my name . . .
and I remember laughing my own gay laugh as I
swung my leg and left him screaming on the floor.
I flew to the coach. He greeted me in his usual
good Matured, gruff way, smashing me in the face
with a length of chain.
"I told you not to Hap your arms in the hall that
way!" he said, "it makes me nervous."
"Coach! ' I screamed (he loved to be called "coach"
it gave him a sense of security) "tell me it isn't true!
. . . tell me you haven't cut your Crazylegs!"
So it was true! Crazylegs Palmieri had been cut
from the team! What of my dreams for gridiron
glory? What of the Block S sweater I had promised
my mother she could wear? Oh how many times
f had pictured myself as a football hero. . . .
How many times have I seen myself in the dressing
room before the Big Game . . . listening as the coach
explains to me how to put on my uniform; feeling the
tension and excitment mount through the room as
someone at the bridge table attempts a finesse; breath
ing the warm, happy comradeship of the locker loom

as my teammates tie me to a bench and sharpen their
cleats on my teeth.
Alas, no more now will 1 thunder out on the field
to the roar of the crowd, and thrill to know that I am
one of this stalwart Stanford team. Then Cal's team
conies out. . . . I note their size and quietly join my girl
friend in the stands. She greets me with love in her
eyes and sol'tly shrieks . . . "You dirty stinking cow
ard!"
"I only wanted a Gremlin," I reply, and hurry back
to my place on the bench. But now the game is on
and back and forth the tide of battle surges. I sit
calmly carving my initials on the bench in Arabic (my
end of the bench compares favorably with the Rosetta
Stone), knowing the coach will put me in when the
right time comes.
I should have known how he felt about me when I
heard him tell the line coach at halftime . . . "you
realize we only have eleven men left? We might
have to use Palmieri!" But I finally got the idea
when one of our hoys crawled over to the sidelines
with a broken leg and I saw the coach wave him
hack into the game with an automatic in his hand.
Yes, my football hopes were shattered finally when
they cut me from the team, but for Stanford it was
athletic suicide. Why, I can still remember when the
school board paid off my father and I left high school
. . . Big Jim Reynolds heard 1 was thinking of coming
to Stanford and called me up.
'"Son," he said (everyone called me "son" but my
father), "son, I've seen you play ball." I blushed.
"And son, we're willing to give you tuition, board,
room, books, a new tire for your bicycle and 50 new
marbles a month if you'll go to USC."
"Geeminy whilakers!" I thought to myself (I had
a ribald tongue as a lad), "if I can get all that by
going to USC, if I come to Stanford they'll give me
the Hoover Tower!"
And now that 1 think of it, as I sit here by my win
dow and gaze out at that great concrete shaft towering
over the campus, that's just what I got . . . figura
tively speaking.
