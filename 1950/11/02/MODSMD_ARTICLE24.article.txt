## What's Wrong With Stanford? 
### 
To the Editor:
What's happened to Stanford football? Where are
Stanford teams like the one which in 1924 after five
years of straight Cal victories could hold the greatest
of the wonder teams to a tie? Where are the coaches
who like Pop Warner could vow that Cal was not
g'.ing to win another one for a long time and keep
that vow? Are those days gone never to return? It
ha;; been 10 years since Stanford has won a Coast
victory, three years since a Big Game triumph. Will
Stanford »-vei' win again? Never before, since 1923,
has Stanford dune so poorly. Never before has Stan
foid been willing to tolerate such a long string of
losses. Under Pop Warner Stanford won 70 games,
lost 18, tied 8. Under Tiny Thornhill Stanford won 34,
lo'.t 25, and tied 8. Under Clark Shaughnessy the
-core was 10 wins and 3 losses. But, under Schwartz,
Stanford, for the first time since Warner came to Palo
Alto, failed to win over half its games: won 25, lost 27,
tied 3.
What's wrong with Stanford? Is it our alumni who
toured the Southland to send the cream of Southern
California's crop of football players to Stanford? Is it
our student body which has win or lose never failed to
c heer on our teams and which has caused sportswriters
to wi itt so highly of "Stanford Spirit?" Or, is it our
coaches? Stanford has never before permitted a coach
to stay as long as Schwartz has and lose. Tiny Thorn
hi'l, who produced three Rose Bowl teams in a row,
was released quickly after four bad years. We, a new
generation have kept Schwartz—the gentleman—be
cause we seem to prefer to lose and say "better luck
next year."
The time has come for action! We need a new coach.
A school which has had such all time greats as Walter
Camp, Andrew Kerr, Fielding Yost, Glenn S. Warner,
and Clark Shaughnessy, should be able to get one of
the top coaches in the nation.
We've got the material, we've got the spirit, so what
are we waiting for? Let's get a coach and go out and
j;et REVENGE for the last 10 years. Next year, let's
come back with Stanford's grentest team of all time
the REVENGE TEAM
