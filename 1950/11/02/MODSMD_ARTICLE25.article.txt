# Big Game Tickets...
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Applications submitted by Life Member Alumni
(class GA) for 1950 Big Game tickets were due not
later than Sept. 1, 1950. While at Stanford last August,
I submitted my application (in class OA) for Big Game
tickets.
At that time, I inquired both at the Alumni office
and at the Department of Athletics if alumni members
were assured of Big Game tickets. 1 was assured of
receiving at least one tickct by both offices. Being as
sured of a ticket, I made the plans that all out-of
towners make when anticipating a trip to the Bay
Area to see the Big Game.
Today, two months after the dead-line for all appli
cations, I received a refund for my application.
I am probably not the only alumnus to be disap
pointed by a refund. However, the disappointment
would be considerably less if one was not incon
venienced by the lateness of its arrival. There must
be some way thai the Athletic Department can inform
applicants earlier so that they will know if they should
make definite plans to attend the game or listen to it
over the radio at home. Also, in fairness, I hope that
the Department of Athletics and the Alumni Associa
tion won't "assure" any more tickets.
