# Reggie, Not Phineas
## 
### 
To the Editor:
As a student from University College, London, per
haps I may correct an error which appeared in an arti
cle ahout Mr. John Brebner in Monday's issue of the
Daily. The life-sized wooden statue of the highlander
named Phineas McLino which was mentioned is the
mascot of University College, and not of Kings College
as stated.
There they idolize a red tin lion called Reggie, a
I en.'t so frail that he invuriably got flattened in the
skirmishes associated with his frequent capture, until
recently when his owners filled him with concrete in
oidi-i hi impart some solidity. . . .
