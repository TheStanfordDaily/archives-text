CAR MOVERS—Village pranksters were on the loose on Hal
loween with the above results. Some fellows from Village 119
decided to have some fun and find a new parking place for the
car, a French Renault. So they simply picked it up and deposited


it in the lobby of Village 121, which is the women's dorm at
the Village. The girls seem to be enjoying the new addition to
their building. —Photos by Malcolm McWhorter
