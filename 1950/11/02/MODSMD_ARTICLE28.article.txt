# Proposition 10 Says Public Can Vote Low-Rent Homes
## 
### CORNELIA LITTLE 
Proposition 10 on the California referendum ballot this fall is
the third major, tricky, and highly controversial initiative constitu
tional amendment.
This one says that before any public body can establish a low
rent housing project it must be submitted to the voters of the

county or city in which the project
is to be located.
It is hailed as an advance for pop
ular democratic government. When
such a housing project is planned,
the federal and state governments
contribute the cost, but the local
authorities contribute through tax
exemption and other forms of as
sistance. In other words, say the
proponents of this proposition, the
voters are paying for this project,
and they have a right to say "no"
to it.
There is now a California stat
ute which says that no low-rent
housing uroject can be underta
ken until the governing body of
the city or county approves it.
Apparently the framers of Prop
osition 10 distrust democratically
elected municipal governments.
In other words, say their oppo- j
nents, they don't believe in rep- j
•resentative government.
Then there's the cost of a special J
election, in case the proposed hous- j
ing project had the bad mariners to 112
turn up when it couldn't be put on j
a regular election ballot.
And finally there's the serious ac- ,
cusation that the anti-10 campaign- '
ers make: that the proposition is j
intended to kill federal housing. 1
And certainly the machinery i
set up by the amendment could
(1) delay the beginning of any
project, and (2) give the oppo
nents of public housing a chance
to fight and defeat those projects.
Builders and real estate men usu- j
ally don't like low-rent housing, j
They seem to like Proposition 10.
Among those who don't like the
proposition are California's Gover
nor and Attorney General, the ma
jor veterans' organizations, and all
of organized labor. The non-parti- I
sun League of Women Voters and
the American Association of Uni
versity Women have opposed it; on
the other hand, the impartial Com
monwealth Club of California has
gone on record for the proposition.
Warren's objection is that it
would hold up civilan defense if
an emergency made special hous
ing necessary. The proposition's
advocates deny that "emergency
housing" falls under the category
of "low-rent housing." For the
record, "low-rent housing" is de
fined in the bill as developments
for persons who do not have the
income to enable them (o live in
"decent, safe, and sanitary dwell
ings."
Proposition 7 is a Legislature- [

sponsored amendment to the Chiro
practic Initiative Act of 1922. This
amendment provides that no blind
person may be denied admittance to
or graduation from a school of chi
ropractic. The consensus of opinion
on this measure seems to be that
it's very nice to do anything pos
sible to make life easy for the blind,
but that a blind man would be
hampered in making diagnoses,
since they involve visual observa
tion and interpretation of symp
toms. On the pro-7 side it is also
claimed that in California many
blind persons are now successful
chiropractors.

would hold up civilan defense if
an emergency made special hous
ing necessary. The proposition's
advocates deny that "emergency
housing" falls under the category
of "low-rent housing." For the
record, "low-rent housing" is de
fined in the bill as developments
for persons who do not have the
income to enable them (o live in
"decent, safe, and sanitary dwell
ings."
Proposition 7 is a Legislature- [

sponsored amendment to the Chiro
practic Initiative Act of 1922. This
amendment provides that no blind
person may be denied admittance to
or graduation from a school of chi
ropractic. The consensus of opinion
on this measure seems to be that
it's very nice to do anything pos
sible to make life easy for the blind,
but that a blind man would be
hampered in making diagnoses,
since they involve visual observa
tion and interpretation of symp
toms. On the pro-7 side it is also
claimed that in California many
blind persons are now successful
chiropractors.
Proposition 10 on the California referendum ballot this fall is
the third major, tricky, and highly controversial initiative constitu
tional amendment.
This one says that before any public body can establish a low
rent housing project it must be submitted to the voters of the

county or city in which the project
is to be located.
It is hailed as an advance for pop
ular democratic government. When
such a housing project is planned,
the federal and state governments
contribute the cost, but the local
authorities contribute through tax
exemption and other forms of as
sistance. In other words, say the
proponents of this proposition, the
voters are paying for this project,
and they have a right to say "no"
to it.
There is now a California stat
ute which says that no low-rent
housing uroject can be underta
ken until the governing body of
the city or county approves it.
Apparently the framers of Prop
osition 10 distrust democratically
elected municipal governments.
In other words, say their oppo- j
nents, they don't believe in rep- j
•resentative government.
Then there's the cost of a special J
election, in case the proposed hous- j
ing project had the bad mariners to 112
turn up when it couldn't be put on j
a regular election ballot.
And finally there's the serious ac- ,
cusation that the anti-10 campaign- '
ers make: that the proposition is j
intended to kill federal housing. 1
And certainly the machinery i
set up by the amendment could
(1) delay the beginning of any
project, and (2) give the oppo
nents of public housing a chance
to fight and defeat those projects.
Builders and real estate men usu- j
ally don't like low-rent housing, j
They seem to like Proposition 10.
Among those who don't like the
proposition are California's Gover
nor and Attorney General, the ma
jor veterans' organizations, and all
of organized labor. The non-parti- I
sun League of Women Voters and
the American Association of Uni
versity Women have opposed it; on
the other hand, the impartial Com
monwealth Club of California has
gone on record for the proposition.

would hold up civilan defense if
