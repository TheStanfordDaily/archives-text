## Midweek Musings 
### 
The grid year 1950 has not, to put it mildly, proved a fruitful one for those
pie-season swum is sometimes laughingly referred to as the nation's football
experts. Battered and shattered by many a week of startling upsets, the
crystal balls of these well-meaning gentlemen have long since been dis
carded into the same rubbish pile containing such relics as last Saturday's
bottle and last month's Injun-to-the-Bowl tie.
Nevertheless, it lias been pointed out, with some irony it is true, that at
least one of the prognostications of yester-month has indeed jelled into
reality..
We refer to the prediction which stated that the identity of the Pacific
Coast Rose Bowl entrant would be decided on Nov. 4. The reference, of
course, was to the Stanford Stadium battle of that date between the Indians
and USC, reputedly the top powers of PCC circles.
Well, the date was right; the setting some 900 miles wrong. For the game
of the year will be played Saturday in Seattle when California and Wash
ington match their two superb backfields before the largest football throng i
ever to assemble in the Northwest.

Prospects are that the 50,000 some-odd fans jamming the Huskies' new J
stadium will not be disappointed in what they see. It's the kind of set-up >
Mr. Average Fan dreams about, a backfield battle de luxe.
Washington's passing game is a delight to behold. In Don Heinrich, the J
Huskies can boast of a quarterback who is probably the best in 1950 col- !
legiate circles; certainly he's the top passer, ball-handler, and signal-caller ;
or. the Coast. And the lads who bear the brunt of Washington's ground j
game—McElhenny, Seth, and Kirkby—could hardly be called green hands
at the game. All of which totals to a nicely-rounded attack.
'J he Bears, on the other hand, are still searching in vain for a passer and j
quarterback. But, and what a but it is, California's running game is ad
mittedly more dangerous than that of their hosts.
They'll tell you at Berkeley that Jim Monaehino, Pete Schabarum, and
Johnny Olszewski have made the Cal backfield the best to cavort in Me
morial Stadium for many a year. The statement is made in full recognition
of the absence of a passer and quarterback worthy ol note. In other words,
Messrs. Monaehino, Schabarum, and Olszewski are so good that nobody
worries very much about the Bears' aerial shortcomings.
In any event, Mr. Average Fan —who is not too interested in watching
outstanding line play, but who would hock his grandmother for a chance to
see a shifty halfback or a daring passing attack—will get a rare treat in
Seattle. Add the ball-toting abilities of McElhenny to those of the Berkeley
trio, throw in the accurate arm of Heinrich and his corps of capable receiv
ers, and you have the ingredients of a very, very interesting ball game.
Who will win? We're riding with the Huskies on the contention that their ;
more varied attack can outlast Cal in a high-scoring contest—and it will be j
mighty surprising if at least seven touchdowns aren't scored.
Heinrieli, MeElheimy Hard to Stop
Perhaps we're leaning too heavily on what we saw in the Stadium last
week. But we don't believe Cal can stop both Heinrich's passing and Me-
Elhenny's running for any length of time. Stanford did it for a half; but
you'll have to give the referees—and a green Husky lineman who wasn't ]
very certain of the holding rules —a big assist on that.
Coach Odell confided after the game that his charges weren't "fired up"
before the game as they should have been. That is unlikely to happen j
against California.
Again, Washington will be considerably stronger this Saturday than last. [
Ace linebacker Bill Petersen has returned to action, as has Fritz Apking, !
the recalcitrant end who was suspended last week for breaking training j
rules. First-string tackle Jim Mangan, who played only a few minutes i
against Stanford, will be available for much heavier duty Saturday.
Apking, incidentally, had received more passes than any other Husky up
to the time of his suspension. The lad who broke our back on those short
bullet tosses from Heinrich, name of Phil Gillis, is merely a sophomore re
placement for Apking.
Add 'em up, and we get the Huskies by at least one touchdown.

mittedly more dangerous than that of their hosts.
They'll tell you at Berkeley that Jim Monaehino, Pete Schabarum, and
Johnny Olszewski have made the Cal backfield the best to cavort in Me
morial Stadium for many a year. The statement is made in full recognition
of the absence of a passer and quarterback worthy ol note. In other words,
Messrs. Monaehino, Schabarum, and Olszewski are so good that nobody
worries very much about the Bears' aerial shortcomings.
In any event, Mr. Average Fan —who is not too interested in watching
outstanding line play, but who would hock his grandmother for a chance to
see a shifty halfback or a daring passing attack—will get a rare treat in
Seattle. Add the ball-toting abilities of McElhenny to those of the Berkeley
trio, throw in the accurate arm of Heinrich and his corps of capable receiv
ers, and you have the ingredients of a very, very interesting ball game.
Who will win? We're riding with the Huskies on the contention that their ;
more varied attack can outlast Cal in a high-scoring contest—and it will be j
mighty surprising if at least seven touchdowns aren't scored.
Heinrieli, MeElheimy Hard to Stop
Perhaps we're leaning too heavily on what we saw in the Stadium last
week. But we don't believe Cal can stop both Heinrich's passing and Me-
Elhenny's running for any length of time. Stanford did it for a half; but
you'll have to give the referees—and a green Husky lineman who wasn't ]
very certain of the holding rules —a big assist on that.
Coach Odell confided after the game that his charges weren't "fired up"
before the game as they should have been. That is unlikely to happen j
against California.
Again, Washington will be considerably stronger this Saturday than last. [
Ace linebacker Bill Petersen has returned to action, as has Fritz Apking, !
the recalcitrant end who was suspended last week for breaking training j
rules. First-string tackle Jim Mangan, who played only a few minutes i
against Stanford, will be available for much heavier duty Saturday.
Apking, incidentally, had received more passes than any other Husky up
to the time of his suspension. The lad who broke our back on those short
bullet tosses from Heinrich, name of Phil Gillis, is merely a sophomore re
placement for Apking.

ington match their two superb backfields before the largest football throng i
