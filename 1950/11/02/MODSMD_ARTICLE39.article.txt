## Upsets, Thrillers Mark Card-SC Grid History 
### LARRY CAHN 
Meeting a Trojan war horse,
which isn't what it used to be,
Stanford's once-proud Indians will
j attempt Saturday to even a rivalry
, which started in 1905. Over a 45-
j year period, in which 30 games have
been played, Stanford has won 14
J games, USC 15, and one contest has
! ended deadlocked.
With all Rose Bowl hopes gone, a
! successful Stanford season now de
! pends upon a win Saturday and a
win against California.
As it looks now, the chances for
a win against USC are far greater
than those for a Big Game triumph.
However, the advantage of added
Stanford spirit due to Homecoming
activities is equalized by the spir
ited USC student migration to the
north and the desire of the Trojan
team itself to fare well in its only
1950 Bay Area appearance.
Series Full of Upsets
The Southern California-Stanford
series is full of upsets, thrillers, and
inspired battles. Past performances
can be discarded in an attempt to
evaluate the outcome of Saturday's
game. The last four games should
substantiate this.
Last year, a win - hungry, six
point - underdog Cardinal eleven
traveled to- Los Angeles to meet
SC's thundering herd. Playing great
ball on the Coliseum turf, the In
dians swept over, past, and through
the Trojans to bring a 34 to 13 win
back to Palo Alto,
A missed try for point, following
Stanford's lone touchdown in 1948,
j cost the Indians at least a tie with
the visiting team from the south.
Being pressed the entire game, USC
was more than satisfied to return to
' Smogland with a hard-earned 7 to
1 6 win. Stanford also dropped the
Rig Game by an identical score.
Inspired Indians *
Going south in 1947, a winless
Stanford squad was made a four
to five-touchdown underdog. Play-
I ing one of the most inspired games
in the annals of Stanford football
history, the cards held the eventual
PCC champions to a two - touch
; down, 14 to 0 win. 9
A surprise Indian squad of 1946
, entertained USC at Palo Alto. The
i Trojans, rated a slight favorite,
1 were brushed off their feet by Stan
ford's early show of speed and de
ception. But, as has been the sad
story more than once, Stanford
lacked the horses, and a powerful,
never say die USC eleven overcame
a three-TD handicap and pushed a
tired Injun team to defeat, 28 to 20.
Going back to 1940, '41, and '42,
j Stanford was successful in three
j starts. In 1940 the Indians knocked
I a determined Troy out of the Rose
Bowl race with a decisive 21 to 7

win at Palo Alto. The Cards hung
a 13 to 0 whitewash on the Trojans
in '41.
Taylor Steals Ball
Chuck Taylor proved that crime
does pay when the All-American
guard stole the ball from USC back
Mickey McCardle to race to the
game-winning touchdowg in Stan
ford's 14 to 6 victory over SC in
1941. The game was played in San
Francisco's Kezar Stadium.
In 1931 and '32 the Trojans had
the greatest football team in the
country. Amassing 27 victories in a
three-year period, it was the goal
of every team to upset the power
ful Thundering Herd.
After their alma mater suffered
two shutouts at the hands of SC in
'31 and '32, a group of sophomores
took it upon themselves never to
lose to USC. A seemingly ridicu
lous vow was realized when the
three-time winners of the Confer
ence waltzed through USC in 1933,
'34, and '35.
Monk Moscrip's field goal with
only 30 seconds remaining pulled
the '35 game out of the fire, and
provided a dream ending for the
Vowing Sophomores.
There have been 15 shutouts in 30
games played; however, Stanford
has been on the long end of the
score only five times. The 1927 game
saw the only tie, that a 13 to 13
deadlock.
Through the years, Stanford has
accumulated 2GO points, while the
Trojans have totaled 318.

which isn't what it used to be,
Stanford's once-proud Indians will
j attempt Saturday to even a rivalry
, which started in 1905. Over a 45-
j year period, in which 30 games have
been played, Stanford has won 14
J games, USC 15, and one contest has
! ended deadlocked.
With all Rose Bowl hopes gone, a
! successful Stanford season now de
! pends upon a win Saturday and a
win against California.
As it looks now, the chances for
a win against USC are far greater
than those for a Big Game triumph.
However, the advantage of added
Stanford spirit due to Homecoming
activities is equalized by the spir
ited USC student migration to the
north and the desire of the Trojan
team itself to fare well in its only
1950 Bay Area appearance.
Series Full of Upsets
The Southern California-Stanford
series is full of upsets, thrillers, and
inspired battles. Past performances
can be discarded in an attempt to
evaluate the outcome of Saturday's
game. The last four games should
substantiate this.
Last year, a win - hungry, six
point - underdog Cardinal eleven
traveled to- Los Angeles to meet
SC's thundering herd. Playing great
ball on the Coliseum turf, the In
dians swept over, past, and through
the Trojans to bring a 34 to 13 win
back to Palo Alto,
A missed try for point, following
Stanford's lone touchdown in 1948,
j cost the Indians at least a tie with
the visiting team from the south.
Being pressed the entire game, USC
was more than satisfied to return to
' Smogland with a hard-earned 7 to
1 6 win. Stanford also dropped the
Rig Game by an identical score.
Inspired Indians *
Going south in 1947, a winless
Stanford squad was made a four
to five-touchdown underdog. Play-
I ing one of the most inspired games
in the annals of Stanford football
history, the cards held the eventual
PCC champions to a two - touch
; down, 14 to 0 win. 9
A surprise Indian squad of 1946
, entertained USC at Palo Alto. The
i Trojans, rated a slight favorite,
1 were brushed off their feet by Stan
ford's early show of speed and de
ception. But, as has been the sad
story more than once, Stanford
lacked the horses, and a powerful,
never say die USC eleven overcame
a three-TD handicap and pushed a
tired Injun team to defeat, 28 to 20.
Going back to 1940, '41, and '42,
j Stanford was successful in three
j starts. In 1940 the Indians knocked
I a determined Troy out of the Rose
Bowl race with a decisive 21 to 7

win at Palo Alto. The Cards hung
a 13 to 0 whitewash on the Trojans
in '41.
Taylor Steals Ball
Chuck Taylor proved that crime
does pay when the All-American
guard stole the ball from USC back
Mickey McCardle to race to the
game-winning touchdowg in Stan
ford's 14 to 6 victory over SC in
1941. The game was played in San
Francisco's Kezar Stadium.
In 1931 and '32 the Trojans had
the greatest football team in the
country. Amassing 27 victories in a
three-year period, it was the goal
of every team to upset the power
ful Thundering Herd.
After their alma mater suffered
two shutouts at the hands of SC in
'31 and '32, a group of sophomores
took it upon themselves never to
lose to USC. A seemingly ridicu
lous vow was realized when the
three-time winners of the Confer
ence waltzed through USC in 1933,
'34, and '35.
Monk Moscrip's field goal with
only 30 seconds remaining pulled
the '35 game out of the fire, and
provided a dream ending for the
Vowing Sophomores.
There have been 15 shutouts in 30
games played; however, Stanford
has been on the long end of the
score only five times. The 1927 game
saw the only tie, that a 13 to 13
deadlock.
