# Varsity Works Against JV's; Eadie, White Out
## 
### 
Back on the hopeful road to re- |
covery, the Stanford Indians held
scrimmages last night for both of- i
lensive and defensive teams in |
preparation for the coming USC [
game Saturday.
Coach Marchie Schwartz
worked the boys hard on offense, j
particularly un pass plays of the
short, medium, and long variety. |
Meanwhile, down at the other end
of the field, the defensive squad,
under the tutelage of Pete Kniet
ovic and Mai Elward, ran through
their defensive assignments j
against USC plays run off by the i
JV's.
On the offensive side of the pic- j
ture, Bruce Van Alstyne and Bob j
Scott are still bothered by their in- i
juries, but are expected to see a

lot of action agains the Trojans.
The defensive lineup finds some
new men in both hte line and the
backfield. Bill Storum takes over
safety position for Big Bill McColl,
while Dick Broome and Dick Horn
will give relief to Harry Hugasian
and Bob White. In the line Leon
King takes over a guard spot, and
Jack Rye and Don Enberg work at'
ends with Marv Tennesfoss reliev
ing.
The only two men who definitely j
will be out for the Trojan battle '
are Gordy White and Ron Eadie.
