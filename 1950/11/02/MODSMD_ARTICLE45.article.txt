# Freshman Wins Jumpers' Stake
## 
### 
Marilyn Swan, a Roble freshman,
mounted her horse Topper Trouble
at San Francisco's Cow Palace last
weekend and rode off with the
$1,000 Championship Jumpers'
Stake.
Miss Swan was invited to partici
pate in an international competition
at Madison Square Gardens this fall
in preparation for the 1952 Olym
pics at Helsinki. She turned down
this offer in order to come to Stan
ford this year, but that didn't stop
her from entering the Jumpers'
Stake at the Grand National Live
stock Exhibition.
The course included 12 obstacles
varying in height from four and a
half to five feet. After completing
it the first time, Miss Swan and one
other were chosen from the 12 con
testants for a jump-off to determine
first price. Miss Swan won this
also, thereby securing the prize.
