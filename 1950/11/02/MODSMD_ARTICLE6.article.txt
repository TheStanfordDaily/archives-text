this afternoon.
The President escaped possible assassination by minutes today

▼ wncn two ruerto mean revolution
aries were brought down in a wild
gun battle on his Blair House door
step.
One of the would-be assassins and
a White House guard were killed in
I the shooting. The other assailant was
i wounded but was expected to live.
Mr. Truman was rudely awa
| kened from an after - lunch nap
when (he gun battle broke out un
der his second-floor bedroom win
dow at about 2:15 p.m. EST. He
rushed to the window to watch
| until guards shouted for him to "get
I back."
Later, apparently unruffled by
the first direct attempt on his life,
| he kept a scheduled appointment at
! an outdoor memorial service in Ar
lington National Cemetery.
Oscar Collazo and Grisclio Torre
sola, the assailants, rushed at the
Blair House entrance on Pennsyl
vania Avenue with blazing pistols
just a few minutes before the Pres
ident had been expected to leave
for the Arlington trip.
Secret Service Chief U. E. Baugh
man said both men were natives of
Puerto RiOo, and members of the
Communist - infiltrated Nationalist
party which staged a bloody upris
ing in the U.S. island territory ear
lier this week. The Blair House at
tack occurred almost simultancous
! ly with an ineffective bombing of
the Puerto Rican government of
fices in New York.
Collazo confessed that "we came
here with the purpose of shooting
the President."
Mrs. Rosa Collazo said she and
, her husband were ardent Puerto
j Rican Nationalists and felt Prcsi
| dent Truman "could have given
Puerto Rico its freedom if he want
| ed to."
The Collazos live in a tenement
I in the "melting pot" section popu
! lated by Italians, Puerto Ricans,
j Spaniards, and Negroes of the East
. Bronx, an area sometimes referred
j to as "the dumps."
When Mr. Truman went to Ar
; lington he left Blair House by an
: alley to escape the confusion. Wh.cn
he returned, he went directly to the
! White House and back to official
j business.
"I never saw a calmer man in
i my life," White House Press Sccrc
! tary Charles G. Ross said.
