# Brazilians 'Critically Friendly' Toward U.S., Says Dr. Siegel
## 
### DONN BYRNE 
You may someday ride a creak
ing little coal - burning train
through the Brazilian state of Baia
and right down the main street of
the village of Nazare.
When you step off that little train,
you will see the quaint little build
ings hanging out over the street,
which extends two feet on either
side of the track. Your eye will
catch the color of a Brazilian mar
ket day as observed by the de
scendants of Negro slaves, now
speaking Portuguese with a mix
ture of African terms. Your nose
may catch a few things, too.
This, you may say to yourself, is
a part of the Brazil of the travel
posters. These people are interest
ing and unusual. You may decide
they arc as completely different
from Americans as they possibly
could be.
You'll be wrong.
According to Dr. Bernard J. Sie
gel, professor of anthropology, who
just returned from a year of study
in Brazil, the Brazilian and the
American arc quite similar. Indi
viduality and pei»onal freedom aie
characteristics ingrained deeply :n
both peoples. In fact, in Brazi'
there are n6 largj clubs or other
collective activities. There is, no
large medical association, r.nthropo
logical association, or even strong
labor unions, except those run by
the government.
Communism in Brazil, therefore,
has a rather loug'i time. There are
many Communist party members
and sypathizers, many more than in
the United States, but any efforts
at strong organized movements
have only limited success.
Toward the U.S., the Brazilians
seem to be "critically friendly," he
said. They aren't excited about such
things as the Russian - American
crisis. Changing coffee prices shared
the headlines with the Korean war.
Bars, serving both coffee una
liquor, are the center of Brazilian
social life. Here, at any hour of the
day, men congregate and drink cof
fee or sugar brandy while discuss
ing current affairs.
One important social outlet is the
American movie. Dr. Siegel reports
that almost every little village, no
matter how remote, has its movie
house. The most popular movies
are not invariably Westerns and
other action pictures. The sophisti
cated picture is often the one that
is most popular. The only way the
natives have of understanding the
picture is by reading the Portu
guese subtitles. Thour'h many of
them can't read, movies such as
"Laura" are a big hit.
Dr. Siegel was interested in t'.e
changes brought to rural commu
nities in Itapacerica dc Serra. aboul
200 miles south of Rio de Janeiro,
by the advent of the first good roads
that those people had ever .seen.
This linking with civilization
brought a big shift from agriculture
to commerce, in the form of the
charcoal business. Big money was
not made by the old residents of

the communities. It was the new- j
comers who had the initiative.
Children in Brazil must attend
school for four years; after that it
is up to them. As a matter of fact,
higher education is very difficult to
attain. Only the small group of
professional men are really we'i
educated. Thus, the vast majority
of Brazilians arc merely equipped
to read, but are given no incentive
to do so.
While in Brazil Dr. Sicgel .stud
ied under a Social Science Research
Council scholarship.


RETURNED FROM BRAZIL—Dr. Bernard J. Siegel, anthropolo
gist, finds that Brazilians share with Americans a love for indi
vidual freedom and a liking for American movies.
