# SJ State Students Operate Lottery
## 
### 
Football lotteries are again opcr- ;
ating on the San Jose State campus.
Last year the lotteries were con
ducted through underground meth
ods. This year the illegal racket
has apparently been accepted by
most students as a part of college
life, according to the Spartan Daily.
Only a few students have registered
complaints on the matter.
Such activities are illegal, accord
ing to the California Penal Code.
Persons participating in the lottery
are guilty of a misdemeanor, usu
ally punishable by six months in
the county jail, $500 fine, or both.
Records have indicated that lot
teries are a good business around
colleges. The Stanford campus
faced the problem of football lot
teries in 1948, but was able to solve
it.
