# Farm Grad Buries Diploma in Korea
## 
### 
When Korean war veteran
Charles M. Hunter says he'll have
to "dig up" his diploma to prove
he s a college graduate, he means it.
Hunter, a 23-year-old Army lieu
! tenant, graduated from Stanford
last January and was sent by the
Army to Japan.
After commencement exercises in
June, the University sent him his
diploma, which caught up to him on
! the Korean front lines.
I Limited in what he could carry,
he buried the document two feet
underground along the Naktong
River, noting the position before he
j moved on with his troops.
Now with the Korean fighting
nearly ended, Hunter, back in Ja
| pan, wonders if he'll ever be able
j to dig up his diploma.
