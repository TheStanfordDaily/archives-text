SAN JUAN, P.R., Nov. 1 (UP)â€”
Gov. Luis Munoz Marin said tonight
that Puerto Rican Nationalists were
being used by the Communists both
in the attempt to assassinate Presi
dent Truman and in the abortive
revolt here.
"The people are profoundly
shocked at the dastardly and luna
tic attempt on President Truman.
We would all feel ashamed of being
Puerto Ricans if the two felons in
volved were not members of the
Nationalist gang of terrorists who
number less than 500 in the whole
island," the Governor said.
A crack-down by the FBI on Na
tionalist party leaders was believed
imminent, and the arrest of party
president Pedro Albizu Campos
was expected momentarily.
Mass arrests of Nationalists were
ordered even before news of the
assassination attempt was received
from Washington.
