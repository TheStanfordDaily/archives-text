WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
Students at the American Institute for Foreign Trade can
answer this question. They are preparing themselves for
careers overseas with American business firms or govern
ment agencies. Under the guidance of distinguished men
who have served abroad, they plan successful careers in
foreign trade. The intensive course of study is designed
for mature students doing upper-level college work. It
is a dynamic new idea in education that teaches not only
business techniques, fluency in foreign languages, but
understanding of the world outside.
