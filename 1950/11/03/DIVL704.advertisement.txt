112 Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests 112
\ Number 6...THE TURTLE 112
They had our slow-moving brother moving ;it too f;i>t
a pace with those quick-trick cigarette tests! A fast puff ... a swift sniff. . .
a quick inhale ... a rapid exhale. Terrapin's head was spinning —
didn't know if he was coming or going! But he slowed down to his own
speed — decided there was no need to rush. After all, he figured,

simply asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke—
on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap
judgments needed. After you've enjoyed Camels — and only < i
Camels — for 30 days in your "T-Zone" (T for Throat,
T for Taste) we believe you'll know why . . .
More People Smoke Camels \
than any other cigarette I :*j
