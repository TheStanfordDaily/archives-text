# Cards to Face Troy In 'Comebacks’ Tussle
## 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's down-trodden Indians will meet the up and coming
IJSC Trojans in the local Stadium tomorrow in a game which was
tagged by pre-season experts as the who-goes-to-the-Rose Bowl
game, but which is now being played for fun.
Smarting under two consecutive defeats at the hands of UCLA

i and Washington, the red-shirted"
Farmhands go into this battle as one
j touchdown favorites.
On the other hand, El Trojan,
winding up in the winner's circle for
the first time this season after beat
ing Oregon, 30 to 21, aren't likely to
want to lose their one-game win
ning streak. Also to be considered is
the old revenge motive, and SC has
plenty of it after taking a licking from
an underdog Cardinal team last year
| to the tune of 34 to 13.
Both the Indians and the Trojans
j have been plagued with injuries all
I season, but will take to the field to
i morrow with nearly a full comple
ment. Stanford takes the short end

KickofT lime for the Stanford
l SC tilt is set at 2 p.m. Saturday.
Previously games have started at
2:30 p.m., but due to the fast
falling autumn sun, kickoffs will
take place earlier.

->112 thi; point, missing the services of
Clordy (Tex) White, tackle, and Ron
Iliad le, end. The Southlanders will be
helped a great deal with the return
of Fat Cannamela, ace Trojan line
backer.
Returning to the lineup for the In
li'ins will be right end Bruce Van
Alstyne, who was looking in good
hare in practice last night, Jack Rye,
defensive end who will probably only
make a limited appearance, and Bob
Scott, another end who will help the
Lai dinal cause.
As all things must give way to
112 ro ress, so must the Stanford 60-
•niriutc player. After watching men
like Bill McColl, Bob White, and
Harry Hugasian tire under the stress
and strain of modern football, Mar
- hit Schwartz has decided to try out
a platoon system. It won't be a pcr
cll system, however; the Stanford
1 ench just isn't that long, so offen
ive members, McColl, Kerkorian,
und Horn will probably be asked to
j lay defense also, but they will only
go ri when it's necessary,
Here's how they'll line up under
the two platoon system Saturday.
Offensive
Left ends — Bill McColl, Doug
Pinto.
Lelt tackles — Dick Gaedtke, Ted
Taylor.
Left guards — Norman Manoogian,
Dick Lucas.
Centers — Dick Abraham, Doug
Thamer, and Don Tobin.
Right guards — Owen Powell, Tom
Romano.
L'ight tackles — Wes Poulson, Ted
Taylor.
Right ends — Bruce Van Alstyne,
Wilbur Taylor, Bob Scott.
Quarterback — Gary Kerkorian,
Tom Shaw, Dick Horn.
Fullback—Bob Myers, Bob Griffin,
Chuck Essegian.
Right halfbacks—Bob White, Boyd
Benson.
Left halfbacks — Harry Huga»sian,
Bob Bryan.
Defensive
Left ends—Jack Rye, Wilbur Tay
lor.
Left tackles — Jim Vick, Chuck
Hokanson.
Left guard—Jesse Cone, Joe Jacob.
Right guards — Leon King, Rod
Garner.
Right tackles — John Broderick,
Hayden Leason, Leonard Kaprielian.
Right ends — Marvin Tennefoss,
John Bonetti.
Line backers—Russ Pomeroy, Tsar
Calfee, Frank (Skip) Crist, Loren
Hinkleman.
Left halfbacks—Joe St. Geme, Bill
Storum.
Right halfbacks — Dick Broome,
Bob Hoegh.

Safety man—Dick Horn, Gary Ker
korian.
On the Southern Cal side of the
picture, reports from way down
South indicate that speed burner A 1
Carmichael is the man to stop. Last
Saturday in the Oregon game, Car
michael suddenly "developed" and
covered 161 yards worth of turf, the
most yardage in one game for an SC
man since Ted Tannehill, El Trojan's
all-Coast contribution for 1945. Com
bined with the passing of quarter
back Wilbur Robertson, who is usu
ally more effective as a runner than
a passer, and line plunger Ralph
Pucci at fullback, USC could quite
easily turn on the heat for the In
dians.
Defensively, the Southerners have
much the same problems that Stan
ford has. They're forced to use as
many, if not more, offensive men on
defense, too. Bob Downs, a standout

Hospitality Committee chair
man Marion Bruinniel has asked
students to join Rally Com and
the Stanford Band and meet the
USC rooters' train arriving in
Palo Alto at 9:20 a.m. Saturday.

in the Navy game and again against
Oregon has evidently taken the left
guard spot both offensively and de
fensively away from Elmer Wilhoite,
pre-season favorite. Tackle Volney
Peters and end Dan Zimmerman will
also share offensive and defensive
duties as will Pucci, who will back
up the line.
The Cravathmen, like the Marchie
men, are relatively weak at pass de
fense which will help the local boys
a great deal and give Big Bill McColl
a chance to up his average.
At any rate, the Stanford Stadium
with the green turf trimmed in faded
Rose promises to hold a great game.
They haven't forgotten Stanford from

last year, and the Indians never for
get the Trojans.

Offensive
Left ends — Bill McColl, Doug

Lelt tackles — Dick Gaedtke, Ted

Left guards — Norman Manoogian,
Dick Lucas.
Centers — Dick Abraham, Doug
Thamer, and Don Tobin.
Right guards — Owen Powell, Tom

Right halfbacks—Bob White, Boyd
Benson.
Left halfbacks — Harry Huga»sian,

Defensive
Left ends—Jack Rye, Wilbur Tay

Right halfbacks — Dick Broome,

Safety man—Dick Horn, Gary Ker

On the Southern Cal side of the
picture, reports from way down
South indicate that speed burner A 1
Carmichael is the man to stop. Last
Saturday in the Oregon game, Car
michael suddenly "developed" and
covered 161 yards worth of turf, the
most yardage in one game for an SC
man since Ted Tannehill, El Trojan's
all-Coast contribution for 1945. Com
bined with the passing of quarter
back Wilbur Robertson, who is usu
ally more effective as a runner than
a passer, and line plunger Ralph
Pucci at fullback, USC could quite
easily turn on the heat for the In
dians.
Defensively, the Southerners have
much the same problems that Stan
ford has. They're forced to use as
many, if not more, offensive men on
defense, too. Bob Downs, a standout

Hospitality Committee chair
man Marion Bruinniel has asked
students to join Rally Com and
the Stanford Band and meet the
USC rooters' train arriving in
Palo Alto at 9:20 a.m. Saturday.

in the Navy game and again against
Oregon has evidently taken the left
guard spot both offensively and de
fensively away from Elmer Wilhoite,
pre-season favorite. Tackle Volney
Peters and end Dan Zimmerman will
also share offensive and defensive
duties as will Pucci, who will back
up the line.
The Cravathmen, like the Marchie
men, are relatively weak at pass de
fense which will help the local boys
a great deal and give Big Bill McColl
a chance to up his average.
At any rate, the Stanford Stadium
with the green turf trimmed in faded
Rose promises to hold a great game.
They haven't forgotten Stanford from

last year, and the Indians never for
