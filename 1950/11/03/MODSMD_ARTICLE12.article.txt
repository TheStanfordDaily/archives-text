# Cards to Face Troy In 'Comebacks’ Tussle
## 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's down-trodden Indians will meet the up and coming
IJSC Trojans in the local Stadium tomorrow in a game which was
tagged by pre-season experts as the who-goes-to-the-Rose Bowl
game, but which is now being played for fun.
Smarting under two consecutive defeats at the hands of UCLA

i and Washington, the red-shirted"
Farmhands go into this battle as one
j touchdown favorites.
On the other hand, El Trojan,
winding up in the winner's circle for
the first time this season after beat
ing Oregon, 30 to 21, aren't likely to
want to lose their one-game win
ning streak. Also to be considered is
the old revenge motive, and SC has
plenty of it after taking a licking from
an underdog Cardinal team last year
| to the tune of 34 to 13.
Both the Indians and the Trojans
j have been plagued with injuries all
I season, but will take to the field to
i morrow with nearly a full comple
ment. Stanford takes the short end

KickofT lime for the Stanford
l SC tilt is set at 2 p.m. Saturday.
Previously games have started at
2:30 p.m., but due to the fast
falling autumn sun, kickoffs will
take place earlier.

->112 thi; point, missing the services of
Clordy (Tex) White, tackle, and Ron
Iliad le, end. The Southlanders will be
helped a great deal with the return
of Fat Cannamela, ace Trojan line
backer.
Returning to the lineup for the In
li'ins will be right end Bruce Van
Alstyne, who was looking in good
hare in practice last night, Jack Rye,
defensive end who will probably only
make a limited appearance, and Bob
Scott, another end who will help the
Lai dinal cause.
As all things must give way to
112 ro ress, so must the Stanford 60-
•niriutc player. After watching men
like Bill McColl, Bob White, and
Harry Hugasian tire under the stress
and strain of modern football, Mar
- hit Schwartz has decided to try out
a platoon system. It won't be a pcr
cll system, however; the Stanford
1 ench just isn't that long, so offen
ive members, McColl, Kerkorian,
und Horn will probably be asked to
j lay defense also, but they will only
go ri when it's necessary,
Here's how they'll line up under
the two platoon system Saturday.

Pinto.
