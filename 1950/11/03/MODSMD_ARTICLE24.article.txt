### 
Going to tomorrow's football game?
Here's how to invite robbery while
you're gone, says Police Chief Gor
don Davis.
All you have to Ho is make sure
no one is left in your living quar
ters during the game. Then the
chances arc pretty Rood that some
one will ransack the place, quoth
the wizened Mr. Davis.
By way of a remedy, however,
Chief Davis recommends that game
goers "slip the cook a couple of
bucks" or make arrangements for
someone else to stay in the building
during game hours.
Robbers don't usually enter a
house if they know someone's there,
smiled the Chief.
Having someone on the premises
also seems to be good fire protec
tion. Both Davis and Fire Chief John
J. Marston said that if someone had
stayed in "Alpha Salvatierra" dur
ing the Sail Jose contest, the fire
probably would have been discov
ered in time to save the two-story
building, now being torn down.
In conclusion, Davis said a few dol
lars or a little cfTort to arrange for
a guard will pay high dividend;, in
property saved.
