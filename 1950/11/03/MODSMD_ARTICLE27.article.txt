To tfie Editor:
We art' in abject disagreement with Mr. Moore's un
wariiariUd chastisement of our unexcelled coaching
stafiji The record speaks for itself. We are quite sure
that<jeveryone agrees from the "capable" Al Masters
on i|p, that no other coach in Stanford history has
(lomji .i more admirable job than that turned in by
( oa«h Marchmont "Marchie" Schwartz.
'I fit- record begins in the post-war year of 194G. Not
a great ytaj- to be sure, but a good one. Alter all, it
was r t!ie first year back in the business. It was cer-
too much to expect to go to the Hose Bowl with
vetefcan-ixiotball players, most of whom had only about
two years' experience (pre-war Stanford and semi
pro j*n-v+ee teams combined). The "lesser lights" on the
teain included Jim Cox and Lloyd Merriman.

'1 pe year of 1947, ("the year of great expectations")
a year of no material, too lew "horses" and a "will to
v in,'" brought to Stanford undreamed-of notoriety.
"A coach who loses every game in big league football
andSgets a new contract and a raise."

1348 was a year of "Don't expect too much." The
teaifi v/as composed of too many ball players in the
process of development, who by 1949 would either be
plajjing better iootball or have graduated. Notable in
tin Lsport headlines of that year was the $3,500 fine
levitd against Stanford for proselyting football players.

l's49 was the year of an up-and-coming ball club,
composed mainly of sophomores of whom one couldn't
expfcet too much during their first ye&r of big time
football. This was the year Bill Leistr (a San Fran
ci;c6 sport's: writer) dubbed as the year of "too lew
hoiaes up front." It is also worth noticing that this
yea| was the end of the era of unbeaten and ufttied
lre.sj: man football teams, thanks to a fair job of coach
ing 'by a feuy named Chuck Taylor. It was also the
yt aii of the amazing feat whereby the ranks of a soph

fore Stanford was not to be expected to go far in 1950.
1949 Box Score: 7—l5 —1
1950. The Rose Bowl year. Stanford had come into
its own. The experts had picked Stanlord ulmost
with unanimity, as "Marchie" could now capably
merge Taylor's three undefeated and untied freshman
teams into an overwhelming "Big Red Machine." Also
the thorough drubbing of USC in 1949 indicated the
potential powerhouse of 1950. However, it must be
noted that "Marchie" cautiously warned us in Fresno
last spring that Stanford lacked depth. This statement
brought a great deal ol unwarranted criticism from
overzealous alumni (and a flood of JC transfers).
Box Score to date: 4—2 —o
Predictions: your choice
Anyone who has the audacity to contend that' Mar
chie's" record is not to be marvelled at, simply has
failed to understand what big-time football is really
like. It is rough even in the lowly Pacific Coast Con
ference. No other coach in Stanford's history can
boast of such a record, despite the "lack of material":
1. A total of 21 games won to date; two ties; and only
213 losses in four and one-half seasons. The win column
notably includes such giants as University of Hawaii,
Idaho, Montana, Harvard, San Jose State, Washington
State College, Santa Clara, USF, etc.
2. The largest fine in Stanford's history for "en
couraging" football players to attend this institution.
3. A bronze plaque for losing every game in the
season and never losing the "will to win."
4. An article in a national magazine depicting the
genius of a modern coach "who loses and they love
him."
We are quite certain that in view of such an excel
lent record, sport fans can understand why there is
now talk of a new five year contract and a raise for
"Marchie." Congratulations, Marchmont—Cinderella
Coach of America!
From those of us who have never lost faith.
