To the Editor:
It seems time, in the name of decency, fair play,
loyalty, and "Stanford Spirit," that a "I like Marchie
and his coaching staff" club should be organized.
People speak and write glibly of "Stanford Spirit" in
terms of cheering at the games. Cheering when the
team is ahead is one small part of "Stanford Spirit" as
I see it. What is meant by "win or lose never failed
to cheer on our team?"
Except for brief moments in the Washington game
il appeared to me that the only sustained attempt at
sincere cheering came from "Red Dog" and his co
horts and even they became more interested in the
announcements of the "open houses" and cheering
for Gloria. I liked Gloria, too!
The alumni has been excused on the basis of scour
ing the Southland for the cream of southern Califor
nia's football crop—very admirable but hardly ade
quate. 1-oys like Hugasion, Kerkorian, Broome, Brod
« i it k, Bryan, Essegian, Horn, Lucas, Rye, St. Genie,
Mid mo.A of the rest of the squad are good college ball
players who are playing up to their ability and yet
they can not repeatedly and consistently play beyond
their physiological limits.
McColl, Pomeroy, Manoogian, Van Alstyne, and pos
sibly others would make any ball club, but they can't
do it alone, particularly when hampered by injuries.
What's the difference between good and great? This is
not a criticism of any Stanford player, but compare
t ,i following: Kerkorian and Heinrich, Meyers and
McF.lhcnny, Kirby and White, McColl and any other
end on the Coast.
Other analogies could be drawn from Saturday's
came:
1 One foot was all that frustrated McColl's gallant
ifToi't to knock down the TD pass thrown to Cloidt —
t!i( effort war, the more remarkable since Cloidt had
successfully eluded another defensive back, and Bill
I'ttcmpted to cover up.
2 If our defensive back had been one step faster he
could have defended successfully against the TD pass
caught by Kirkby.
!l. I! the tackles had slowed Gillis by as much as one
or iwo steps Ileinrich would not have completed those
i nnoying quick passes.
4. If a couple of tackles had been a little surer,
Washin gton would not have scored the third TD one
foot, on* step, a few defensive blocks, a few
: harper tackle:: and Washington might not have scored,
'i hot's the measure for firing Marchie.
I am sure that Marchie and his very fine staff have
attempted time after time to impress the squad with
the importance of that one foot, that one step, the
defensive maneuvers to knock down an end, and
they certainly have emphasized lepeadtcdly better
tackling than was demonstrated on several occasions.

Andy Kerr, Fielding H. Yost, Pop Warner, Clark
Shaughnessy, liny Thornhill, and Marchie Schwartz
are or were all great coaches. They have all had great
success while winning and losing ball games, and inci
dentally, Kerr, Yost, Warner, and Shaughnessy have
had some lousy seasons.
Would Stanlord be keeping her standards high with
someone less gentlemanly than Schwartz and players
less scholarly than the boys on the squad at the pres
ent time? Or should we win at all costs?
Let's get "Stanford Spirit" which includes loyalty
and l'orget about getting revenge.
