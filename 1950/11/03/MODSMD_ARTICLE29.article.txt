# Trials of Reggie
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Needless to say I am grateful to University College,
London, student Peter Broadhurst for correcting the
erroneous impression that Kings College was in any
way connected with the disreputable character known
as Phi near, McLino.
When I read the article about my part in "Julius
Caesar" I was horrified at the error but choked back
my rage, kept a stiff upper lip, etc.. as I am given to
understand all true Englishmen are expected to do in
times of great emotional stress.
I would like to reassure readers that Reggie, our
noble lion, in spite of several major surgical opera
tions in the last few years, is still in good shape and
looks as young and virile as ever.
It will no doubt help Stanford students to realise
what a bunch of hooligans Reggie and his loyal band
have to contend with when it is pointed out that Uni
versity College lias the same initials as University
of California.
