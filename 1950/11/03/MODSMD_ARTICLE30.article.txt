# Athletic Probe

To the Editor:
Two years ago I wrote "The time is overripe for an
investigation of the athletic situation at Stanford."
This means not alone the football coaches, but the
whole athletic setup and the allotment of funds (There
has been an improvement since we got a new presi
dent), and should include general student knowledge
of, and interest in sports.
For example, does the team want to play competition
of the caliber of Army? Would the student body accept
a small fraction of the self-discipline that the team
mustâ€”if they are to play on even terms, with say,
Army?
Do the rooters know what the game is all about?
Do they care to know?
