# California, Ohio, New York Crucial States As Election Campaigns Wind Up Tuesday
## 
### CORNELIA LITTLE Daily Political Editor 
Tuesday evening will mark the wind-up of 1952's hard-fought
off-year political campaign. The Republican party is bidding for
Control of Congress, on a platform of opposition to "Democratic
socialism" and "red tape, red ink, and Red Communism," in in the
words of GOP National Chairman Guy G. Gabrielson.

The Democrats are standing on
such strong political advantages as
continued national prosperity, vic
-1 tories in Korea, and the support of
organized labor.
A gain of 42 seats in the House
could give the GOP control there;
I seven more Republican Senators
would mean a Republican Senate
as well. There £.* e 36 Senate se;>ls
at stake, 23 of which are held by
i Democrats and 13 by Republicans.
Twenty of these are labeled as
| "crucial" by political observers;
they are the ones in which the vote
' could go either way. Gubernatorial
elections are also being held in 32
| of the 48 states.
In most quarters, the Republi
j cans are expected to gain ground
to remain in control. Both parties
| in this election, and the Democrats
\ are campaigning desperately to get
i out their vote, the Democrats in
particular believing that a total na
\ tional turnout of 40,000,000 or more
I will insure a Democratic gain in
! both houses.
Among the crucial Senate scats
J at stake is that of California
I Democrat Sheridan Downey, for
which Helen Gahagan Douglas
and Republican Richard Nixon
i are waging a touch-and-go battle.
Prominent Administration figures
| from practically every part of the
! country except California have
thrown their influence into the fight
on Mrs. Douglas' side, while Nixon,
a leader in the outs' attack on Com
munism in Truman's government, is
running on his opponent's voting
record in Congress as well as his
I own.

Another state where the senato- j
rial race is a 50-50 bet is Ohio,
where organized labor is fighting to
oust "Mr. Republican," incumbent
Robert A. Taft, and replace him
with Joseph Ferguson.
The Democrats made consider
able gains against Taft in the last
election, and a victory for them this
time would be a major setback to
a man who is a possible contender
lor the GCP presidential bid in
1952.
At stake in New York is the
future of another important Re
publican figure, Thomas E. Dew
ey, whose chances of being re
elected Governtv of New York
took an unexpected turn recently
with the publication of the "Han
ley letter." His political stock has
been considerably lowered by this
piece of evidence suggesting that ;
present Lieutenant Governor Joe
Ilanley was "bought off" by Dew
ey when the latter decided to run
arain for Governor.
Hanley had been Dewey's only
opponent for the Republican guber
natorial nomination. This affair,
which is now being investigated by
a Senate committee, has given the
Democrats a real issue, and some
j observers believe that if their can
didate, Walter 11. Lynch, defeats
Dewey, the latter will be faced with
a revolt within the party in New
; York.
Other races worth keeping an eye
i on:
In Illinois, Senate Majority Lead
er Scott W. Lucas is expected to
maintain his seat against Everett
Dirksen in an election that Demo
crats and Republicans agree t is "a
referendum on the Truman admin
| istrption."
In Pennsylvania, anti - machine
i Governor James H. Duff is running
for the Senate and is expecated to
unseat Democratic whip Francis J.
i Myers. And a Democrat who also
has an excellent anti-machine rec
ord, Richardson Dilworth, is ex
! pected to make a good showing
agains John S. Fine in the guber
! natorial election.
In Connecticut, Chester Howies

and William Benton are waging
a razz-ma-tazz campaign to keep
their jobs as Governor and Sena
tor against strong Republican
competition. Democratic Senator
Brien McMahon (of the Atomic
Energy Committee ol Congress)
is also up for re-election.
More than $3,000,000 is being
! spent on this campaign by the two
' parties and by the CIO Political
Action Committee and the* AFL
| League for Political Education. Fi
! nal reports, say observers, may set
i a new record for off-year elections.

Tuesday evening will mark the wind-up of 1952's hard-fought
off-year political campaign. The Republican party is bidding for
Control of Congress, on a platform of opposition to "Democratic
socialism" and "red tape, red ink, and Red Communism," in in the
words of GOP National Chairman Guy G. Gabrielson.

The Democrats are standing on
such strong political advantages as
continued national prosperity, vic
-1 tories in Korea, and the support of
organized labor.
A gain of 42 seats in the House
could give the GOP control there;
I seven more Republican Senators
would mean a Republican Senate
as well. There £.* e 36 Senate se;>ls
at stake, 23 of which are held by
i Democrats and 13 by Republicans.
Twenty of these are labeled as
| "crucial" by political observers;
they are the ones in which the vote
' could go either way. Gubernatorial
elections are also being held in 32
| of the 48 states.
In most quarters, the Republi
j cans are expected to gain ground
to remain in control. Both parties
| in this election, and the Democrats
\ are campaigning desperately to get
i out their vote, the Democrats in
particular believing that a total na
\ tional turnout of 40,000,000 or more
I will insure a Democratic gain in
! both houses.
Among the crucial Senate scats
J at stake is that of California
I Democrat Sheridan Downey, for
which Helen Gahagan Douglas
and Republican Richard Nixon
i are waging a touch-and-go battle.
Prominent Administration figures
| from practically every part of the
! country except California have
thrown their influence into the fight
on Mrs. Douglas' side, while Nixon,
a leader in the outs' attack on Com
munism in Truman's government, is
running on his opponent's voting
record in Congress as well as his
I own.

Another state where the senato- j
rial race is a 50-50 bet is Ohio,
where organized labor is fighting to
oust "Mr. Republican," incumbent
Robert A. Taft, and replace him
with Joseph Ferguson.
The Democrats made consider
able gains against Taft in the last
election, and a victory for them this
time would be a major setback to
a man who is a possible contender
lor the GCP presidential bid in
1952.
At stake in New York is the
future of another important Re
publican figure, Thomas E. Dew
ey, whose chances of being re
elected Governtv of New York
took an unexpected turn recently
with the publication of the "Han
ley letter." His political stock has
been considerably lowered by this
piece of evidence suggesting that ;
present Lieutenant Governor Joe
Ilanley was "bought off" by Dew
ey when the latter decided to run
arain for Governor.
Hanley had been Dewey's only
opponent for the Republican guber
natorial nomination. This affair,
which is now being investigated by
a Senate committee, has given the
Democrats a real issue, and some
j observers believe that if their can
didate, Walter 11. Lynch, defeats
Dewey, the latter will be faced with
a revolt within the party in New
; York.
Other races worth keeping an eye
i on:
In Illinois, Senate Majority Lead
er Scott W. Lucas is expected to
maintain his seat against Everett
Dirksen in an election that Demo
crats and Republicans agree t is "a
referendum on the Truman admin
| istrption."
In Pennsylvania, anti - machine
i Governor James H. Duff is running
for the Senate and is expecated to
unseat Democratic whip Francis J.
i Myers. And a Democrat who also
has an excellent anti-machine rec
ord, Richardson Dilworth, is ex
! pected to make a good showing
agains John S. Fine in the guber
! natorial election.
In Connecticut, Chester Howies

and William Benton are waging
a razz-ma-tazz campaign to keep
their jobs as Governor and Sena
tor against strong Republican
competition. Democratic Senator
Brien McMahon (of the Atomic
Energy Committee ol Congress)
is also up for re-election.
More than $3,000,000 is being
! spent on this campaign by the two
' parties and by the CIO Political
Action Committee and the* AFL
| League for Political Education. Fi
! nal reports, say observers, may set
i a new record for off-year elections.
