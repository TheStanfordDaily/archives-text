# SHAKESPEARE
## Costuming For 'Caesar' Is Functional 
### MAGGIE BERNT 
Costuming a large cast on a limited
budget is never easy, but costuming
for "Julyjs Caesar" presented par
ticularly difficult problems for Vir
ginia Opsvig. Stanford Players cos
tume director.
First matter to be solved was the
decision as to which era the costumes
would represent. The play which
takes place in Rome during the age |
of Julius Caesar, was first presented i
in London in the late sixteenth cen- i
tury. Costuming for the production, I
as was the custom, was in the regu- ;
lar Elizabethan style of the audience i
with perhaps a few suggest.ons ol
Reman dress.
Past Styles Varied
The Roman toga bus been used
mainly in later presentations, al- j
though a recent production of the |
play used modern dress exclusively
in an attempt to dramatize the paral
lel of modern day events to situations
found in the Shakespearean tragedy. |
I:i order to decide which costumes j
would be most effection to their pro
duction, Miss Opsvig met with Di- !
rector A. Nicholas Vardac and set
designer Wendell Cole at the end oi
summer quarter. They realized that
the type oi costume they used would
be especially important since the
general effect of the play would be
influenced by the era in which the
action was set.
Timclessness E nphasized
Their decision was not to pin down
the problems of the play age or lo
cation by use of a stylized costume,
but rather to use a functional cos
tume to emphasize the timelersness
of the situation.
Roman boots, tights and modern
tunics form the basis of the designs.
Colors have been used by Miss Ops
vig and her nine-member costume
crew as well as her costuming class
have done the work on most of the
80-odd costumes required by the pro
duction, which opens next Wednes
day night in Memorial Auditorium.
When "Julius Caesar" is over, Miss
Opsvig who, in her four years with
' the Stanford Players has designed
| everything from medieval gowns to
uniforms, will start to work on the
; next Stanford Players' production,
and she knows from experience that
I that assignment may mean anything.
