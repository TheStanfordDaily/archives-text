# Radio Performer Can't Stand Farm Pace; Transfers to Cal
## 
### 
The Stanford Family ended a running conflict with "One Man's
Family" this week when Father Barber's Mickey Rooneyish
grandson, Pinky, came home and announced that he planned to
go to Cal.
It was the Dean's office that had the last word, according to the

script of Miles' Labortory's 8 p.m.
daily program. Before he left, how
ever, the obstinate William "Pinky''
Murray left a few more gray hairs
around the University, from the Di
rector of Information to the Presi
dent's office.
It all started this summer when
Pinky was accepted (on the radio)
at Stanford. Following his sup
posed registration, he wrote home
a stream of disparaging letters
about Stanford that upset the
morale of real-life members of the
Stanford faculty and aluinni. The
criticism of the Farm that rolled
off Pinky's letters into the homes
of thousands of radio listeners
throughout the country was too i
much for the Administration.

A complaint was registered with
the National Broadcasting Company,
outlet for the program, and the reply
came back that Stanford's ruffled
feelings were about to be smoothed
out. Pinky, who didn't even eet a
chance to take a final, was getting a
note from the dean.
"He never could have gotten into
Stanford in the first place," said Di
-1 rector of Information Frederick 0.
| Glover.
The payoff was that Pinky's model
brother, Hank, was writing glowing
j praises home about Cal, where he
; chose to go.
Pinky's main trouble at Stanford
seemed to be Economics. Through
; some quirk in requirements, the

script writers permitted him to take
econ in his first year. It was the
red-faced Economics Department
that uttered the loudest yelps after
the program.
Pinky referred to the econ pro
fessors as "'bookworms that couldn't 1
make a living outride the Univer- i
sity." Due to his dislike of economics |
he decided to switch his major to j
forestry. There being no such de- ;
partrnent at Stanford, he decided on
Cal.
Underneath it all was a $250 debt,
mysteriously contracted. When
Hazel, Pinky's mother, phoned his
dorm one night to lind out about
it, she was told he had "checked
out."
"Impossible," said Glover. "We al
ways keep track of our students
They can't check out like that."
NBC was cordial in its reply, and
said that if the University official
knew Pinky like the listeners do, they
wouldn't worry about Stanford's
reputation.
