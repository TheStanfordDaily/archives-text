# Songs of Josh White Heard in Concert
## 
### MAGGIE BERNT 
Josh White, carrying his guitar under his arm, walked out onto
the empty stage of the Palo Alto Communty Theater Wednesday
night and began to sing.
He sang old English ballads such as "The Riddle Song" and
spirituals, like "There's a Man Taking Names." He sang songs

like "Frankic and Johnny" that
everyone knew and songs such as
"Jerry" that few in the audience had
ever heard. He even sang "One Meat
Ball."
Each of his songs had a depth of
feeling and sincerity not often heard
today. The audicnce was carried
away by the emotions of the dark
skinned man on the stage, often join
ing in with him in familiar verses.
If there was a person there who left
the theater without humming a mel
ody, he must have been deaf—or
dumb.
Not a small part of praise for Josh
White's performance goes to his gui
tar playing. If there was anything
missing in his voice, it was well-sup
plied by the instrument which com
plemented his clear, low voice so well
that often it was difficult to distin
guish between the guitar and the
voice.
The instrument laughed when he
laughed, cried when he cried, and
shouted when he shouted. It was
especially effective in the sad, some
what eerie "Molly Malone," and the
slightly raucous "Where Were You
When My Heart Went Out?"
White was hampered during the
first part of the program by a micro
phone which limited his vocal power,
but after discarding it to the delight
of the audience, the full impact of his
voice reached everyone.
When the program was completed,
White was recalled to the stage for
half a dozen encores, and the audi
ence was asking for still another
when the house lights went on.
After listening to Josh White sing,
it seems certain that he will be en
joyed as long as there are folksongs
to sing, and folksongs will live as
long as there are men like Josh White
to sing them.
