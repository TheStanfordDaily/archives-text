# Russian Studies Slogans To Predict Red Policies

### CORNELIA LITTLE 
"Quite a few things come across my desk."
That is the way Serge Yakobson, Russian-hern historii.n now doing
research work at the Hoover Library, describes his job as chicf of the
Foreign AlTairs section of (he Library of Congress' legislative Reference
Service.
In Washington Dr. Yakobson heads a stall' of 12, along with four or (ive
senior specialists, for giving legislators whatever information they may
desire or need about any aspect of foreign affairs, inlii national ri lations,
or International trade.
To illustrate the scope of division's j

work, he explains that with the Ko
rean situation, the accent has been on
the Far East; also, work has to be
done on the Japanese peace treaties,
and German rearmament is still an
other problem on which Congress
must know all the fact, the pros, and
the cons—"They will not let us be
idle for a long time," he concludes.
In addition to these responsibilities
the section is consulted on questions
involving national defense and sup
plies information to other govern
mental agencies as well.
Dr. Yakobson's own specialty is
Russia, and he has reported to Con
gressional committees on such sub
jects as the strategy and tactics of
world Communism, trends in Russian
foreign policy, and the Communist
movement in other countries.
Required to lie on hand in
Washington whenever Congress is
in session. Dr. Yakobson is now on
pnnual leave with a grant from the
Rockefellers, and is to he found in
a cubicle of Mr. Hoover's tower,
expanding his study of the fluctua
tions of the Communist Party line
as expressed in its May Day slo
gans.
"Nothing is left to chance," he says
of the Soviets' propaganda slogans.
Each year the slogans are rewritten,
and Dr. Yakobson has found that a
close study of the changes in their
emphasis, wording, and content
makes possible forecasting the Reds'
future line of propaganda and action
—taking the pulse of the Cominform,
in fact. Particularly marked through
the years has been the see-sawing
between the theme of international
revolution and that of domestic se
curity. (The latter was dominant
during the war, for instance, and the
former is now back in the ascendant.)

The technique used in these studies,
the first part of which has been pub
lished in a collection of public opin
ion studies entitled The Language of
Politics, is one that Dr. Yakobson
has developed himself. It involves
both a "quantitative" analysis
comparisons of word frequencies—
and a "qualitative" one. "I never
know whether the two are going to
jibe," say Dr. Yakobson, "but so far
I've always had the same results
from both methods."
The march of events has brought
him a long way from his native
country of Russia, which he left in
1919. He attended the University of
Berlin and worked in the German
Archives department until he was
dismissed by Hitler in 1933. From
1933 to 1940 he was a professor of
Russian history at London Univer
sity, and it was then that some of his
studies were published by the Toyn
bee Institute.
For the past 10 years Dr. Yakobson
has been working for the United
States government in Washington, in
addition to lecturing and teaching at
summer sessions.
Asked what he thought of Stan
ford, Dr. Yakobson's first comment
was, "I don't know if I am more
impressed by the number of stu
dents of the number of cars."
More seriously, he added that he
was particularly impressed by the
quantity and variety of intellectual
and cultural activity on the campus,
and by the fact that "Palo Alto and
Stanford live together" and share
that activity, each community being
an important factor in the lile of the
other, to an extent that is not found
in city universities.
