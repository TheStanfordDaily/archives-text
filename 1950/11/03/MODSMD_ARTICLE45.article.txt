# SIRO Gets Okay on Winter Benefit Show
## 
### 
SIRO, Stanford International Relief Organization, will stage a
benefit concert sometime winter quarter in an effort to boost what
president A 1 Nichols called a "50 per cent cut in this year's funds,"
at Wednesday's Excom meeting.
Excom approved SIRO's petition for the benefit concert, possi-

bly featuring Nelson Eddy, at the
meeting.
Nichols told representatives that j
SIRO "will come nowhere near get
ting the $2,300 it received via the
winter quarter relief drive last year.
He said the fact that Excom decided
to hold the IIR drive during fall quar
ter this year accounts for the dif
ference in revenues.
President Nichols set Feb. 25 as the
j probable date of the concert. Speak
ing in his behalf, Concert Series
Manager Pat Beverly said SIRO
"can't lose money on the project, in
so far as the principal attraction will
appear on a percentage basis."
In other action Wednesday night,
the Executive Committee approved
]an election by-law revision sub
mitted by Chairman Jack Hunter
raising the unit requirement of all
! students running for soph, junior, and
j senior class representatives by 15
j units.
Hunter said the change was neces-
J sitated by the fact that class repre
sentatives are now being elected fall
quarter instead of spring quarter, as
previously specified.
By way of appointments, Excom
I appproved the selection of Fletcher
| Taylor and Joan Isheim as co-chair
| men of Iligh School Day, scheduled
j for late winter or early spring quar
| ter.
Guest speaker at meeting was for
! student Reiko Ishikawa, who, in
a word, told those present that "it's so
wonderful to be in America."
Miss Ishikawa indicated she would
like to stay in this country two years
instead of one, but that she felt a
"great responsibility to tell everyone
at home about the American way of
i life. It's so wonderful . . ."
