# Wilber Leads With 50 Wins
## 
### 
The "Peerless Pickers" haven't
produced a peerless picker yet,
though a few weeks ago Sports Ed
itor Dwight Wilbur almost had a
perfect slate when he picked 14
games correct.
In last week's merry-go-round A 1
Berry came out on top, hitting 11
out of 13 games and two ties. With
that great spurt of speed by the
tail-ender, the sports scribes went
ahead of the profs 140 to 136, the
first time this season that the
scribes have led.
Wilbur continues to hold indi
vidual honors with 50 right and 19
wrong, increasing his lead over the
nearest competitor to five games.
Berry still brings up the rear but
is now only two lengths behind the
pack.
Only one of the pickers had the
astuteness—is that what you call
it?—to pick Washington over Stan
ford, and that was—you guessed it
—A 1 Berry.
In the upset department Berry
again was the man of the hour as
he chose Princeton over Cornell
and Fordham over USF. On the
latter pick Prof-picker Balch con
curred and got himself a hole in
one.
All of the experts made 100 per
cent on the Cal-St. Mary's, USC-
Oregon, Illinois - Indiana, Penn-
Navy, and Texas-Rice games.
