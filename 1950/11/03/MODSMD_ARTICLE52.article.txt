# Mermen Face SC, Fullerton
## 
### 
Coach Tom Haynie's water polo
team faces a pair of tough oppo
nents in the local pool this week
end.
This afternoon at 3:30 the Cardi
nal mermen will take the water
with the always formidable South
land squad from Fullerton JC, and
tomorrow at 11 a.m. they will have
another go at the University of
Southern California.
In the first meeting of the Indians
with the Trojans, the Redmen came
out on the short end of a 6 to 3
score. But the locals have more
than revenge as a motive in wanting
to win this one. They need a win
in tomorrow's splash to get them
selves out of the league cellar which
they currently share with Califor
nia.
An added highlight in tomorrow's
affair will be an exhibition of div
ing staged by Olympic ace Bruce
Harlan who now coaches the Stan
ford frosh.
Here are the lineups for the
weekend's games as they were an
nounced yesterday by Haynie:
Cf, Bob Froien; If, Hub Stokely;
rf. Bob Wycoff; cb, Don Weeden;
g, Ernie Polte; g, Jerry Smith;
goal, Marsh Pearlman.
