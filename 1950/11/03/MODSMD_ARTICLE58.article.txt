# Trojans Will Display Their Faltering Talent
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Jeff Cravath's Floundering Herd, wallowing painfully through
its most dismal season in many years, will display in Stanford Sta
dium tomorrow the talent that was supposed to provide USC with j
a sure-fire Bowl contender, but has managed instead to place Mr.
Cravath squarely on the well-known spot.
Seventeen lettermen, 15 sophomores, and 12 outstanding junior

College transfers make up the bulk ,
of the Troy squad that has won but
one game all season. Perhaps the
sheer weight of numbers has con
fused headman Cravath; in any
event, his starting lineup has sel
dom resembled that of the week be
fore.
The backfield in particular has
sported a different cast each Satur
day. But USC finally won one last
week aaginst hapless Oregon; and
for the first time, the Figueroa
mentor has announced his starting
backfield in the middle of the week.
But more about the backs later.
Let's take a look, position by po
sition, at the battered and begrimed
Trojans who hope to remove some
of the muck from their 1950 record
when they invade the Stadium to
morrow:
ENDS: Top man is Hal Hatfield,
a long-time fixture with the Troy
men, currently putting in his third
year as a regular. Stanford fans
will remember him as the receiver
of a 63-yard touchdown pass play
which scored one of USC's two
touchdowns aqainst the Cards last
year. Hal stands 6 ft. 1 in.,t weighs
better than 200 pounds.
At the other flank it'll be either
Dan Zimmerman and Bill Jessup.
Jessup sports by far the fancier
record of the two — he was Troy's
leading aerial gainer last year —but
Zimmerman got the call against
Oregon last week. Both are letter
men, Jessup with two monograms
to his credit, and between them
they racked up nearly 40 points for
USC in 1949.
TACKLES: The two starters at
tackle represent the extremes in
experience. Senior Volney Peters
spent one year making All-Amer

ican JC with Compton, the last j
three as a first-stringer under Cra- 1
vath. Peters reached his peak dur
ing his sophomore year when his
savage play was a big factor in
USC's stunning 14 to 14 upset tie
with Notre Dame.
GUARDS: Lots of experience
here. Paul McMurtry, 225 - pound
bruiser from the Lone Star State,
is another of the Trojans' six
double - monogrammed performers.
' Paul is not only the oldest man in
collegiate football this year (he's
30), he's also one of the ablest. Of
fense or deefnse. Paul is the stand
out of the Troy forward wall.
Bob Downs, who gets the other
starting call, will miss the distinc
tion of becoming a three - letter
winner by the margin of a leg in
jury which kept him out of action
last season. Bob weighs 210 and,
with McMurtry, gives the center of
the USC line much-needed heft.
CENTERS: Lou "Rattlesnake"'
Welsh, 195-pound soph, has started
much of the time. A good all
around player, Lou is happiest
when performing as a linebacker.
| Also seeing plenty of action at the
center slot will be Gene Beck who,
like Downs, lettered in '48 but was
injured most of '49. Bob is com
paratively light for the position, 180
j pounds, but makes it up with ex
-1 ceptional speed.
QUARTERBACKS: Cravath is

loaded here, but so far hasn't quite
figured out what to do about it. j
Frank GifTord, Wilbur Robertson, ,
and Ed Demirjian have all taken a
turn at the first - string job, and
have all showed something less j
than sensational.
Robertson will get the call Sat
urday, Cravath says, but all three
are expected to work before the
final gun. Wilbur and Gifford are i
both holdovers from last year, when j
they played behind the very able ;
Jim "Mystic" Powers. Nevertheless, I
Demirjian has grabbed most of the
publicity, due mostly to his sensa
tional record with Muir JC last
season.
I HALFBACKS: Another unhappy
i situation developed here this sea
, son; but Troy supporters are confi
dent that A 1 Carmichael has now
| solved their running worries. An
other JC Ail-American last year,
with Santa Ana, Carmichael started
! slow this season, reached his own
last week against Oregon. Indica
| tions are that A 1 is the boy to stop
Saturday. Against the Ducks, he ,
! broke loose for a 67-yard pay-dirt
! jaunt.
FULLBACK: Ralph Pucci has
taken over the dock vacated by
Batt eship Bill Martin. Ralph
weighs 175, is known as "the Canton
Bulldog.'' A deadly tackier, he had
i been used mainly on defense until
I this season, but earned his letter in
both '48 and '49.
