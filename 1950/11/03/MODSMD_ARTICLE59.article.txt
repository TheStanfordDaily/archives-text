# Undefeated, Well-stocked Trobabes to Face Frosh
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
A Stanford frosh team that has finally "jelled" will lock horns
with its toughest foe to dale, USC's yearlings, at 11 a.m. tomorrow
in Stanford's big brown bowl.
After being nipped by Santa Clara, 14 to 13, in the opener, the
Papooses came roaring back with decisive wins over UCLA (34 to

7) and San Jo;e State (28 to 7). The 4,
froshers have not forgotten that t.'.eir '
predecessors knocked over 16 op- j
pontnts in a row, and they would like
to start a little spree oi' their own.
USC, 27 to 20 winners over Cul
frosh last week, may have ideas of
their own about any win streak,
'lheir io.;ter includes a faliulojs
number of high school plums. Take
for example, Chuck Weeks, an All-
American High School tackle, or
quarterback Jim Contralto, se
lected Southern California CD
Player-of-the- Year.
Then there are end Tom Weber, I
All-State from Ohio; center Jim Reid,
and halt Bill Casler, all GIF first team
members; center Art Paul, end Syl
van Berrie, and halt Dale Dull, All-
Stute players from Oregon, fi that is
not enough, there is fullback Ken
Thompson, All-State from Arizona;
half Desmond Koch, All-State from
Washington; and All-Northern Cali
fornia tackle John Skocko. There are
21 high school captains on t'.ie squad.
USC's press clippings, however,
which outweigh Stanford's four to
one, won't have any effect on the
outcome of the game. Realizing this,
the Cardbabes have been sharpening
| their running attack the first part ol
i the week. Yesterday, Coach Bob
Ghilotti had his team run through a
S passing scrimmage.
1 'ihe Papooses, however, won't go
j into tomorrow's game at full
strength. Dick Gant, a strong
tackle, will probably miss the con
test with an ankle hurt. Andy
Thompson, another stellar lineman,
has a broken bone in his leg. lie's
out for the season.
Don Harcourt will fill in for Gant
j on offense with Ron Buffi taking the
1 defensive stint. Other starters in
clude John Steinberg and Dud
Herschback, ends; Marsh Howe,
tackle; Larry Webster and Frank
Druhan, guards; Dick Steele, center;
Bob Garrett, quarterback; Ron Cook
| and Bill Scheidecker, halves; Don
Day, fullback.
One of the high points of last
week's game was the come-through
performance of end Tom Howell
and half Hank Gillen. They will see
I plenty of action tomorrow. Also
; slated for heavy duty is quarter
back Doug Collins, an excellent
j field general.
The Trobnbes hold two non-Con
| ference wins over Chaffey College,
' 43 to 12, and Sanla Ana JC 27 to 20

21 high school captains on t'.ie squad.
USC's press clippings, however,
which outweigh Stanford's four to
one, won't have any effect on the

the Cardbabes have been sharpening

i the week. Yesterday, Coach Bob
Ghilotti had his team run through a
S passing scrimmage.
1 'ihe Papooses, however, won't go
j into tomorrow's game at full
strength. Dick Gant, a strong
tackle, will probably miss the con
test with an ankle hurt. Andy

out for the season.
Don Harcourt will fill in for Gant

A Stanford frosh team that has finally "jelled" will lock horns
with its toughest foe to dale, USC's yearlings, at 11 a.m. tomorrow
in Stanford's big brown bowl.
After being nipped by Santa Clara, 14 to 13, in the opener, the
Papooses came roaring back with decisive wins over UCLA (34 to

7) and San Jo;e State (28 to 7). The 4,
froshers have not forgotten that t.'.eir '
predecessors knocked over 16 op- j
pontnts in a row, and they would like
to start a little spree oi' their own.
USC, 27 to 20 winners over Cul
frosh last week, may have ideas of
their own about any win streak,
'lheir io.;ter includes a faliulojs
number of high school plums. Take
for example, Chuck Weeks, an All-
American High School tackle, or
quarterback Jim Contralto, se
lected Southern California CD
Player-of-the- Year.
Then there are end Tom Weber, I
All-State from Ohio; center Jim Reid,
and halt Bill Casler, all GIF first team
members; center Art Paul, end Syl
van Berrie, and halt Dale Dull, All-
Stute players from Oregon, fi that is
not enough, there is fullback Ken
Thompson, All-State from Arizona;
half Desmond Koch, All-State from
Washington; and All-Northern Cali
