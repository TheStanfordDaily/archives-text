LOS AUGELES, Nov. 1 (UP) â€”
Washington's brilliant quarterback,
Don Heinrich, is well on his way to
ward setting new records for pass
ing and total offense, Pacific Coast
Conference statistics showed to
night.
Heinrich leads the conference in
i all passing departments, and his
yardage from passing is sufficient
to-give him a lead of more than
400 yards over his nearest rival in
total offense.
Stanford's Bill McColl, although
slowed down in his last two games,
still led the conference in pass re
ceiving, with 20 catches for 515
yards and three touchdowns.
