# USC Game
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” A football
game between Stanford and USC
that used to draw at least 70,000
fans will be watched by only about
3.1,000 this Saturday.
That's the conservative estimate
on the attendance for the game at.
Stanford and is blamed on two fac
tors: (1) both teams have been
knocked out of the Rose Bowl race;
(2) television.
