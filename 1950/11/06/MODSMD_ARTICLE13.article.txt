# Sweepstakes Won by Chi Psi And Cubberley
## 
### 
Cubberley - Chi Psi took the
Homccoming liou.se decorations
sweepstakes prize Friday night,
edging out runner-up Jordan-Sig
ma Nu by one point.
Judges Herman F. Frankel and
Raymond D. Harriman of the Clas
sics Department and L'Omelette's
Andre Frelier deliberated almost
an hour on the sweepstakes deci
sion.
Cubberley-Chi Psi's "black light"
depiction of the Indian forcing the
Trojan on the Hoover Tower rocks
was considered closer to the "Indian
and the Odyssey" theme of Home
coming than Jordan - Sigma Nu's
Indian Tantalus holding out a foot
ball to a clutching Trojan in Hades.
And that was the margin of differ
ence.
Decorations were judged on a
point basis, using five criteria â€”
originality, theme, group participa
tion, color, and general effectiveness.
The Women's Division trophy went
to Jordan-Sigma Nu; runner-up was
the Lathrop-Theta Chi entry.
Best of the Men's Division was
the ATO-Ventura entry picturing an
Indian cyclops defending his lair
from a Trojan. Runners-up were
Betas-Roth and Delta Chi.
Theme prize went to the Phi Sigs
for their depiction of Ulysses and the
giants Scylla and Charybdis, with the
SAE entry as runner-up.
The trophy for the Most Original
entry was won by the SAE's. This
was the third prize-winning year in
a row for SAE Stan Norton. In 1948
Norton designed the Village 210 Big
Game float that won Sweepstakes
honors, and last year it was the Nor
ton-designed SAE entry that carried
away the Sweepstakes trophy in the
house decorations competition.
Runner - up in the Most Original
Division was the Russell-AKL two
headed monster.
Sigma Chi's portrayal of a canoe
ing Indian bringing down the "Odd
SC" won top honors in the Most Hu
morous Division. Runner -up was
Theta Xi.
