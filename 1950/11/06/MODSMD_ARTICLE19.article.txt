# Indians Tie Trojans In Frustration Game
## Officiating Costs Cards a Touchdown; USC Scores on Deceptive Pass Play 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's "Frustration Bowl" game turned out to be very frus
trating Saturday, as the Indians, after being rushed off their feet
in the first half by USC, came roaring back in the closing minutes
to tie the fired-up Trojans, 7 to 7.
It could have been called the "forgetful game," for (1) Stanford

forgot that they were supposed to
, win by eight points, (2) USC forgot
j that they arc traditionally a team
1 that doesn't start fighting until the
second half, and (3), according to
| many observers, the officials forgot
j the rules of the game.
No sooner had Bob Bryan lifted
the first kickofl than the Trojans
i opened up with an attack that had-
I n't been seen all season, with the
I possible exception of the USC-Cal
[ game.
Before the first quarter was half
I over, USC put seven points on the
I board and made it look so easy that
j the 40,000 people in the stands be
i gan to think that the oncc-victot i-
I ious Trojans had been grossly un
i dcrestimated.
SC Trick Flay Scores
The Trojans scored on a never
j before-used play that may never
I work again, hut it nevertheless
! served its purpose. Quarterback
j Wilbur Robertson pitched out left
! handed to halfback John Williams,
I who headed for the l ight sideline,
pulled up to a stop, and passed
diagonally to halfback Jim Sears
standing all by himself in the left
corner of the end /.one.
A few moments before SC's score,
however, the cards pulled a TD of
| their own out of the nag, but it was
called back on a backfield-in-mo
tion penalty. It was also of the
pitchout variety, as halfback Bob
White accepted the ball from qb
Gary Kerkorian in the fiat and
tossed a beautiful 40-yard pass to
Big Bill McColl, who pranced
remaining 10 yards.
Card TD's Called Bark
Again in the second period the
Cards went over, but it appears that
a referee had blown his whistle
declaring that the forward motion
had stopped. Neeiiess to say, the
I Stanford side didn't like it.
Two other plays in the first half
I might have set up Card touch -
j flowns, had they cone differently:
[ one, a pass from Kerkorian to Mr
! Coll in front of the Stanford root-
I ing section which went incomplete
j (Big Bill was momentarily wrapped
up with a Trojan defender), and
another lony pass by Kerkorian,
| this time to Bruce Van Alstyne who
j just did miss it.
Indian Drive Stopped
After an offside penalty against
j the Trojans in the kickoff opening
the second half, Bryan carried the
second kick back to the Indians'
| 27-yard line, and it looked as if
Marchie had said a lot during inter
! mission.
Kerkorian passed to Van Alstyne
i for 18. then he passed to Harry Hu
j tfasinn for three more. Bob Meyers
' hit left tackle for five. Gary then

hit McColl for six yards and .1 first
down.
Hugasian fumbled a lateral, but it
was rccovercd. The next, play found
Harry over left end for one yard
and Boyd Benson hit renter for
three yards.
Then came the most controvc ;i-d
play of the game. A Kerkorian j>
to McColl on the 10 was gathered
in by both McColl and Frank (iil
ford, the SC defender. According to
the rules of the game, if both men
had possession of the ball, il should
have gone to the* offensive t
(Stanford), but Field Judge Pet';
Lcnz ruled that Clifford po • e . ■'<
more of the ball than McColl and
USC took over on an interruption,

Stanford's "Frustration Bowl" game turned out to be very frus
trating Saturday, as the Indians, after being rushed off their feet
in the first half by USC, came roaring back in the closing minutes
to tie the fired-up Trojans, 7 to 7.
It could have been called the "forgetful game," for (1) Stanford

forgot that they were supposed to
, win by eight points, (2) USC forgot
j that they arc traditionally a team
1 that doesn't start fighting until the
second half, and (3), according to
| many observers, the officials forgot
j the rules of the game.
No sooner had Bob Bryan lifted
the first kickofl than the Trojans
i opened up with an attack that had-
I n't been seen all season, with the
I possible exception of the USC-Cal
[ game.
Before the first quarter was half
I over, USC put seven points on the
I board and made it look so easy that
j the 40,000 people in the stands be
i gan to think that the oncc-victot i-
I ious Trojans had been grossly un
i dcrestimated.
SC Trick Flay Scores
The Trojans scored on a never
j before-used play that may never
I work again, hut it nevertheless
! served its purpose. Quarterback
j Wilbur Robertson pitched out left
! handed to halfback John Williams,
I who headed for the l ight sideline,
pulled up to a stop, and passed
diagonally to halfback Jim Sears
standing all by himself in the left
corner of the end /.one.
A few moments before SC's score,
however, the cards pulled a TD of
| their own out of the nag, but it was
called back on a backfield-in-mo
tion penalty. It was also of the
pitchout variety, as halfback Bob
White accepted the ball from qb
Gary Kerkorian in the fiat and
tossed a beautiful 40-yard pass to
Big Bill McColl, who pranced
remaining 10 yards.
Card TD's Called Bark
Again in the second period the
Cards went over, but it appears that
a referee had blown his whistle
declaring that the forward motion
had stopped. Neeiiess to say, the
I Stanford side didn't like it.
Two other plays in the first half
I might have set up Card touch -
j flowns, had they cone differently:
[ one, a pass from Kerkorian to Mr
! Coll in front of the Stanford root-
I ing section which went incomplete
j (Big Bill was momentarily wrapped
up with a Trojan defender), and
another lony pass by Kerkorian,
| this time to Bruce Van Alstyne who
j just did miss it.
Indian Drive Stopped
After an offside penalty against
j the Trojans in the kickoff opening
the second half, Bryan carried the
second kick back to the Indians'
| 27-yard line, and it looked as if
Marchie had said a lot during inter
! mission.
Kerkorian passed to Van Alstyne
i for 18. then he passed to Harry Hu
j tfasinn for three more. Bob Meyers
' hit left tackle for five. Gary then

hit McColl for six yards and .1 first
down.
Hugasian fumbled a lateral, but it
was rccovercd. The next, play found
Harry over left end for one yard
