# A 						Referendum for the Ballot
## 
### 
The question of how far Excom's jurisdiction
should extend has been focused on a problem
which is not local in fact but certainly local in
interest.
The specific problem is whether a decision
on the loyalty oath referendum lies within the
scope or the authority of the Associated Stu
dents.
The loyalty oath appears at first glance to be
one of those matters which is fajr outside the ivy
covered wall of Stanlord. However it has a
definite hookup with student interests on the
•Farm. The oath has become a major factor in
modern day education. It has appeared not
only at the University of California but also in
ether colleges throughout the United States.
The oath actually represents an educational
theory. Stanford students study other theories
such as different forms of democracy or parti
san politics. They express opinions on these
theories on the ballot.
Moreover, those who believe the referendum
is not something to be considered on the Stan
ford ballot might take a look at another phase
of ASSU activity—the lIR program.
Here v/e are concerning ourselves with for
eign students or with foreign relief programs or
with educational programs which improve rela
tions with people from other countries.
Isn't the oath just as close to our line of inter

est as the Free University of Berlin?
We are not marking an X either in favor of
the oath or opposing the oath at this time. How
ever we are concerned with getting the oath
referendum on the fall ballot, for we feel it is a
matter within the scope of the ASSU to decide.
Some opponents of the proposal fear the con
sequences of publicizing the oath referendum
as coming from the ASSU. "We don't want to
be attached in this all-inclusive terminology,"
they say.
Although the results of such a referendum
might not'represent a unanimous opinion of the
student body, the action would be described as
stemming from a majority vote of the Stanford
student body.
As has been pointed out previously, the stu
dents at the University of California and at the
University of Chicago have felt no qualms
about attacking a loyalty oath affecting educa
tion. Faculties at Harvard, Columbia, and Chi
cago, as well as those at other institutions have
gone on record as opposing the oath.
The Stanford student body should at least
have the chance to decide whether they want to
state their disapproval of the oath. Respect for
the student's right to express his opinion on a
referendum petitioned by 400 fellow students
is certainly essential for the cause of democratic
student government.

•Farm. The oath has become a major factor in
modern day education. It has appeared not
only at the University of California but also in
ether colleges throughout the United States.
The oath actually represents an educational
theory. Stanford students study other theories
such as different forms of democracy or parti
san politics. They express opinions on these
theories on the ballot.
Moreover, those who believe the referendum
is not something to be considered on the Stan
ford ballot might take a look at another phase
of ASSU activity—the lIR program.
Here v/e are concerning ourselves with for
eign students or with foreign relief programs or
with educational programs which improve rela
tions with people from other countries.
Isn't the oath just as close to our line of inter

est as the Free University of Berlin?
We are not marking an X either in favor of
the oath or opposing the oath at this time. How
ever we are concerned with getting the oath
referendum on the fall ballot, for we feel it is a
matter within the scope of the ASSU to decide.
Some opponents of the proposal fear the con
sequences of publicizing the oath referendum
as coming from the ASSU. "We don't want to
be attached in this all-inclusive terminology,"
they say.
Although the results of such a referendum
might not'represent a unanimous opinion of the
student body, the action would be described as
stemming from a majority vote of the Stanford
student body.
As has been pointed out previously, the stu
dents at the University of California and at the
University of Chicago have felt no qualms
about attacking a loyalty oath affecting educa
tion. Faculties at Harvard, Columbia, and Chi
cago, as well as those at other institutions have
gone on record as opposing the oath.
The Stanford student body should at least
have the chance to decide whether they want to
state their disapproval of the oath. Respect for
the student's right to express his opinion on a
referendum petitioned by 400 fellow students
is certainly essential for the cause of democratic
student government.
