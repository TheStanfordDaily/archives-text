# Housing Com—A Compromise
## 
### 
"Why don't they change the room drawing
system?" has long been the cry of over half the
women students, who dislike the freshman
bulge in the drawing ratio each spring.
A plan to change the system will be pre
sented to all campus women tonight by Hous
ing Committee.
Housing Corn's plan is a compromise—and
like most compromises is innocuous and not
very inspired. The present system in the spring
drawing allocates the vacancies on the Row and
in Union Units in proportion to the number of
women drawing from each class. Housing
Corn's plan is a balance between this and the
system of senior preference which v/as voted
clown last spring. The plan is as follows:
1. The basic ratio is:
a. Up to one-half of the total number of
women in each house may be seniors.
L. One-fourth of the total number of
women should be juniors.
c. The remainina one-fourth should be

sophomores.
2. If the above distribution does not fill a
house, the remaining vacancies will be
filled by class preference. In no case may
over one-half of the total number of women
be seniors.
The advantages of this plan are: (1) that it
makes the drawing system uniform for all three
quarters; (2) that a larger number of seniors will
be placed on the Row; (3) that the system is less
complicated and easier to understand.
This is the best plan that Housing Com could
agree upon, but the committee does not con
sider it the only plan possible. Any woman
who has a plan that she feels is an improvement
on this one is asked to submit it to her AWS
representative. No plan will suit everyone, but
we will have more chance of getting a work
able drawing system only if a dozen or more al
ternative plans are submitted. —A.M.L.
(Editor's Note. Senior preference will be
discussed in tomorrow's Daily.)
