### VIC PALMIERI 
Deer Nefu—
1 reckon as gittin a litter from us folks kud make a
body plumb unstrung . . . but there aint nobody died,
boy, so dorft start frettin. Its just yur ant n me
had curselve .sich a surpassin fine time avisitin yuh
the whole we ken if that we figjjered to write yuh this

ht-ie thankee note.
r ] hat farm o'yourn sure is one
nice stick o land, boy. Course
yuh kinda I he pasture all clut
tered up with sheds and sich, but
1 reckon I never set eyes on a
liner silo than thet one of Mr.
Hoover's. Now I know where
them Republicans get all that
silage they been feedin us lately.

liut how in tarnation kin yuh run a farm with a
water hole like thet thar Lagunita? Dryer than yur
Ant Polly's cornbread it looked to me. Course you
merrhuned that thar warnt on drinking on campus
but what about washin? Reckon I understand now
wl.y yuh spend so darn much o'yer time up at ihet
water hole in the hills you call Rossatt's . . •. yuh
always was a great one for keepin yerself clean, boy.
I jest got one more question bout thet Farm o yourn
. . . Yuh got that nice big stretch a good grazin land
up in back thar . . . yu know, where them people is
always walking around with them bags full a different
size sticks and beatng at them little white balls and
spending mo.st a their time cussin around in the
bushes . . . and I notice yuh plenty a good sized
hay barns . . . like thet thar Russell House . . . but
I ain't never seen any cattle round that farm . . .
how come, boy?
Only thing I kind figure from areadin the Daily and
thet magazine yur ant makes me read in the smoke
house ... I fern it the name . . . you know, the one
thet collects stuff writ on rest room walls? . . . well,
Ikie I say, only thing I kin ftgger is that the price
a'eorn must be darn near rock bottom round there
abouts, so yur concentrating on hog feedin.
3ut gittin back to this weekend, boy . . . ah sure
was impressed with thet Frosty ampheetheater where
yuh all had thet prayer meetin Friday ni"ht. Fart is,

tween the frost and thet wet grass I won't be doin no J
sittin till the spring thaw. And thet thar Red Hound j
o'yourn ... I have to tell yuh, boy . . . yer ant an me i
was powerful stirred with his preachin . . . way he J
leads thet Hymn puts Billy Grdham plumb to shame.
And we sure got a kick outa them house decorashuns i
up thar on the Row . . . jest tween us I liked thet
jug o'4 Roses best myself, but ant was kinda partial
to thet fancy oni cross the street from thet Post office
... It was purty all right, but I jest plain couldn't
understand it. Nice to know, though, thet all thet
money its cost in yer folks to send ye to this farmin'
school aint going to waste ... I notice you are ig
norant as ever but I guess yore gonna be bout the
fastest man in the county with a bale paper
when you come home.
And thet sure was a fancy feed you fellers threw
Saturday afore the game. Yer*ant and me like t'eat
ourselves ('death, till we found it was costin us ten
dollars a plate. Nice bunch o'boys yuh got up there, j
but yet ant is still badgering me to tell 'er who them
were she seen chained up in thet closet when she went !
t'hang up her coat. And she was sure tickled with the i
the way yuh had everything fixed up so nice ler the
ladies . . . course she kinda got rattled by the sight |
o'them goldfish.
Now bout thet game with them snappy fellers from
LA . . . them Trojans ... I still wanta know jest one j
thing. Why in tarnation did some o'them USC boys J
have different uniforms than t'others? Leastways I
noticed where them what worked hardest against
Stanford were all fussed up in striped shirts and knee
britches . . I dont know much bout thet thar game
a'foothall, but does strike me kinda unfair for Stan
ford to have eleven players and USC 15. ... in yore
own darn corral too. Looks to me like thar a little too
smart fer yuh Farm boys.
Wei! boy . . . time fer milkin bout now so yet ant 1
and me set this here litter out for old Pete to [
pick up in the morn in' . . . you'll be a hearing from j
us more regular like now on. We gotta use up some a
thet fraternity stationery you sold us last year . . .
its stacked up so hiph in the Barn we aint got no
room fer cows.
