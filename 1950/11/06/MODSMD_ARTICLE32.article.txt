# Cardbabes Upset Troy In Thrill-Packed Battle
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's frosh footballers calmly read the Trobabes' press
clippings and then proceeded to beat them 21 to 19 at Stanford
Stadium last Saturday in one of those games you read about but
seldom see.
Flashy plays, breakaway runs, and long passes had the spec-

tutors jumping to their feet every'
jther minute.
The Trobabes took the opening
kickolT, lnit couldn't move any
where so kicked back to Stanford,
anil halfback Eton Cook took the
ball to his own 21. A Bob Garrett
to Dud Hers eh back pass took the
oval to the 35.
At this point halfback John
Gilmore, a real star Saturday,
took a handoff from Garrett and
scampered O yards to the USC
three-yard stripe. He was aided
in his journey by on Harcourt's
and Frank Druhan's key blocks.
Don Guillen squeezed out a half
yard, and fullback Don Day, find
ing daylight at left guard, barreled
over for the score. Garrett neatly
added the extra point, as he was
to do on two subsequent occasions.
The Trobabes, whose high-school
stars had been undefeated in three
games, scored in explosive style a
tew moments later .Desmond Koch,
a two-time all-state prepster from
Washington, scooted 40 yards
his own 20 to the Stanford 40.
Not feeling like doing any more
running, Koch wheeled back on the
next play and dropped a 40-yard
touchdown pass into the anxious
arms of end Sylvan Berrie. The
conversion was missed.
Midway in the second quarter,
the Papooses made it 14 to (i. They
drove all the way from their 22,

touchdown pass from Garrett to
high-school teammate Sam More
ly-
The Trobabes scored right at the
beginning of the second half as
quarterback Jim Contratto accepted
a Garrett punt on the 50 and zipped
all the way to the end zone, shak
ing oil at least five Redshirts on his
trtk.
After the ball had changed hands
several times, guard Larry Webster
fell on a Trobabe fumble on the SC
31. It was the third bobble that
Webster had recovered.
It was at this point that Coach
Bol) Ghilotti's team pulled a play
that will have tongues wagging
for a long time. Garrett handed
the ball to Guillen on what ap
peared to be a garden variety line
play. Guillen, however, leaped
high in the air and bulleted the
ball to Morely on the 15. Con
tratto tackled Morely, but More
ly hit end Tom Howell with a
long lateral pass and Howell bar
reled down the sidelines to the
four — razzle-dazzle at its best.
Guillen then rammed through the
befuddled Trobabes for the game
< linching TD.
