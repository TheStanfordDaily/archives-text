# WATER POLO
## Cards Win 3; Gain 2nd Place 
### 
Stanford's water polo team, which
had beaten San Jose State Thurs
day 12 to 9 and Fullerton JC Friday
5 to 2, completed a successful week
end Saturday by downing the
mighty mermen of Troy 4 to 1.
Bob Frojen opened the scoring
midway in the first period, Hub
Stokely added a pair in the second,
and Bob Wycoff came back after

the SC goal with the clincher late
in the fourth.
With their win the Cards climbed
into second place in the PCC stand
ings behind the Trojans and re
tained a mathematical chance to
win the championship.
Transportation difficulties caused
the late arrival of part of the Ful
lerton team and postponement of
the start of the game for 40 min
utes, but when the game did open
Bob Frojen got the Indians off to
their quick lead with a brace of
goals.
The Spartan contest was a com
plete rout with the second string
starting the game, the third string
playing the second quarter, the first
string in for only the third period,
and the second playing again in the
fourth.
