THE HIPSTER RAMBLES—On Stanford's first scrimmage play Saturday Harry Hugasian breaks
loose for five yards before Pat Cannamela (42) coming up from the right, can dump him. In the
left background Booming Bob Myers (19) has laid the key block on Trojan left end Hal Hatfield.
Troy tackle Volney Peters (77), also dumped, falls on his back.
