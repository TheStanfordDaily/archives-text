# SC's Best Ties Indians; Cutri Impresses Marchie
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
"USC has some great backsâ€”l
think they've found themselves."
Thus did Stanford Coach Marchie j
Schwartz laud the Trojan team '
which had just surprised the odds- I
makers by battling Schwartz's fa- i
vored Indians to a 7 to 7 tie in Stan- I
ford Stadium.
Schwartz was particularly im
pressed with the running of Cosimo
Cutri, lightning - fast Trojan half
back who amassed the highest
yardage of the day on sweeps j
around and through the right side j
of the Card line.
Defense Satisfies Schwartz
Was Schwartz satisfied with the
performance of his defensive line,
operating for the first time under
the platoon system?
"Definitely," was the quick reply.
"I thought our defensive line did
a good job. Certainly USC made i
yardage, but they're going to do
that from now on."
Questioned in regard to Tom
Shaw's fourth - down pass with I

Stanford in possession on the one
yard line in the fourth quarter,
Schwartz commented:
"It was just one of those things
that looked good at the time, but
backfired on us. With USC using
an 11-man line, Van Alstyne had
found himself wide open on the
three previous plays, and the jump
pass looked like the smart thing to
do. As luck would have it, Van
was bumped and held up for the
first time on the fourth down."
Marchie was understandably
singing the "White" blues alter the
contest. Bobby White was disquali
fied by the referees the entire sec
ond half, and "we missed his run
ning very much."
Outstanding Trojans
Individual praise was reserved by
Schwartz for the line play of Tro
jans Volney Peters and Bob Downs,
whose defensive work plagued his
Cards all day, and for the entire
Troy backfield.
On the Stanford side, Marchie
thought Boyd Benson did "a whale
of a job under the circumstances."
The circumstances referred to were
the chest cage protecting Boyd's
broken ribs and a muscle cramp
that bothered him most of the day.
Cravath Praises Blocking
On the far side of the training
quarters, Troy headman Cravath
disclosed the opinion that the of
fensive blocking of his charges had
been the best of the year, better
even than against California.
Cravath praised Indians Bye,
Cone, and Pomeroy for their defen
sive work.
For Pomeroy Cravath emitted a
long, low whistle and a simple, re
spectful exclamation. "That guy!"
