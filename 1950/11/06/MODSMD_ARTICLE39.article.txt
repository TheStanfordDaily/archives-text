they actually did, but lor there- !
maining part of the third period it
was all Cosimo Cutri, right half for
the Trojans. After gaining one yard
over center, Cutri started working !
on the right side of the Card line, j
He made lots of yardage, but, as |
Schwartz later put it,"He didn't
hurt us."
With Tom Shaw in at quarterback
for the Cards in the fourth quarter,
the Big Red Machine started to I
roll.
Dick Horn's 70-yard kick in the j
early minutes of the last period put j
the Southlanders in a hole that they |
never came out of. Starting on !
Southern Cal's 4]-yard line, Shaw,
with the invaluable aid of Boyd
Benson and Bob Bryan, engineered
the team down to the Trojan five
yard line in eight plays.
After three tries at the center
of the SC line, Shaw was informed
by Van Alstyne in the huddle that
he was getting out into the open,
and Shaw decided on a quick pass
over center. But, on fourth down,
the Trojans put up an 11-man line,
Bruce was bumped, and he couldn't
get there in time.
Cards Finally Tie Score
Southern Cal then took over and
after three short plunges at center,
kicked to Dick Broome on the SC
42 - yard line. Broome brought it
back to the 30 and again the Indians
were on the way, this time to a
score. Benson plunged over right
tackle for the TD with less than
three minutes of the game remain
ing. Kerkorian converted to tie the
score, and a sigh of relief by
the Stanford rooters was heard
throughout the stadium.
