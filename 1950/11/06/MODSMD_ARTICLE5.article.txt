SKA ISLAND. Ga. â€” A four-year
time-table for diverting a steady
flow of raw materials and produc
tive capacity from civilian goods to
military equipment is being com
pleted by Secretary of Defense
George C. Marshall, it was learned
today.
The program will call for a con
sistent level of military spending
designed to avoid peak loads of
orders which might later result in
unemployment and wasted produc
tion facilities.
