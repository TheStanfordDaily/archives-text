# New Loyalty Oath Petition Will Demand Referendum
## Four Hundred Signatures Necessary To Force Excom Action on Measure 
### 
A new referendum petition concerning the loyalty oath is cir
culating this morning in preparation for new student action at
Excom Wednesday night.
As in the first petition, which made the rounds last week, 400
names will be necessary before official action is required by the

ASSU. The new proposal states:
"Resolved, that a policy statement
on academic freedom and loyalty
oath:; for faculty members is a mat
ter for referendum ballot and is
within the scope of our association's
authority as set down in the ASSU
Constitution."
The new referendum is an answer
to the action taken by the ASSU Ex
ecutive Committee last week declar
ing the loyalty oath referendum out
side the st o|>e of the student body's
authority, according to Carl Stover,
Stanford Forum chairman, who is
pushing the petition.
This referendum merely requires
thai I' xeom art on the new petition
or place it on the fall election bal
lot, Stover said.
If t'le Indents should decide the
oue-.tion i, within the scope of their
Hi i dir. ion to consider the loyalty
"ath a:: such, then the ASSU would
I e required to hold a special election
<~>n the o'd referendum.
New int rest, in the prospects of a
second referendum was aroused over
the weekend as some students felt
the problem was not thoroughly un
derstood by some Excom represen
tatives and their constituents last
week.
Alberta Engvall, who spoke in fa
vor of the initial referendum at last
week's Excom meeting, caid it
seemed likely that the 400 names
could be obtained on the petition in
time for the meeting Wednesday.
