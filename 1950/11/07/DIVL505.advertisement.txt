AN OPEN LETTER TO GRADUATE STUDENTS
In the representational reapportionment decreed by
the ASSU Executive Committee last Spring, the graduate
student body was given an additional representative on
Excom, doubling the number of graduates now sitting on
that committee. This increase was given in due recog
nition of the large enrollment of graduate students, but
by no means does it in any way approach proportional
representation. It is felt, wrongly I believe, that gradu
ate students are: ( 1 ) not affected by ASSU decisions, and
(2) not interested in student activities. On the contrary,
such subjects as the campus parking problem, the loyalty
oath, and campus cultural activities are of special import
—and interest to all graduate students. It is my wish to
present these matters to Excom from a graduate's point
of view, increased Excom interest in the problems of the
graduate students, coupled with greater graduate partici
pation in student affairs will establish rapport between the
graduate student and his University with multiple bene
fits to both parties. Tomorrow's election for our second
seat on Excom will show the entire University our willing
ness to contribute our share. Let's all vote!
