## Russian Fighters Attack in Korea 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 7 (UP)â€”
Four Russian-built jet fighters, at
least one from the "privileged
sanctuary" of Manchurian bases,
briefly challenged United Nations
air supremacy over North Korea
Monday but ground fighting settled
into an ominous, uneasy lull.
Lt. Gen. Walton H. Walker seized
advantage of the lull to send the
U.S. Second Infantry Division stink
ing east across the narrow waist of
North Korea to establish an un
broken defense line against an ex
pected new Communist assault.
In central and eastern Korea
three United Nations spearheads
still were fighting their way to
ward the Manchurian border.
