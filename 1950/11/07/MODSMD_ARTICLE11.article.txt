# MILLIKAN, NOBEL WINNER, TO SPEAK
## Series Topic: Science, Religion 
### 
Nobel prize winner Dr. Robert
A. Millikan will lecture this eve
ning at 7:.'50 in Memorial Hall au
ditorium on the subject "Two Su
preme Forces in Human Progress."
Best known for his isolation and
measurement of the electron and
his photoelectric research, Dr. Mil
likan is recognized also for investi
gation of cosmic rays, which origi
nate new heavier atoms from light
er elements.
Planned to Re Athlete
The 82-year-old scientist began
his career by a chance incident
during his undergraduate days at
Oberlin College. Until his junior
year, young Millikan's main inter
est centered around Obcrlin's ath
letic department. After competing
successfully in the 100- and 220-
yard dashes, he continued working
his way through school as a stu
dent assistant in gymnasium classes.
Then in his third year, a profes
sor asked him to teach a class in
physics. The need for additional
money drove him to accept the job,
although he had no knowledge of
the subject at all.
His plans to become a gym in
structor were quickly abandoned.
From the start Millikan became so
absorbed in his new job that he
whs determined to be a physicist.
Wins Nohel Prize
The scientist believes that this
creation of new elements is evi
dence that a Creator has provided
for the continuance of the uni
verse. The fusion of religion and
science will be the theme of his
talk.
Dr. Millikan retired in 1946 as

j administrative head of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology, where
lie had taught and done research
1 since ID2I. He won the Nobel Prize
in 1f,23 for work he had previously
conducted at the University of Chi
cago.
He has also studied at Columbia
University and the Universities of
Berlin and Goettingen. During
| World War I he was vice-chairman
and executive officcc, ( of the National
Research Council.
Dr. Millikan enn look back over

his life's work and count 20 honors
from nine countries and 17 books,
plus his autobiography.
This list of triumphs was largely
the result of working from l(i to 20
hours a day. He pushed his en
durance capacity up to the maxi
mum by performing his experi
ments and research while standing
at a c'e.sk especially designed for
this purpose. He claims he "could
n't fall asleep while standing."
Religion and Science Related
As for sciencc today, Dr. Millikan
believes that there is a close asso
ciation between it and religion. This
fusion will be the theme of his talk
tonight.
"One value of the study of sci
ence." he has said, "was in learning
to differentiate between right and
wrong — what is correct and what
is incorrect. Everyone who studies
sciencc finds tliei*' is a right track
and a wrong track."
His past work helped lead to the
fission of the atom, but he is not
yet convinced that the much-dis
cussed hydrogen bomb will be able
to explode the earth out of the
universe.
"I'm si ill skeptical. I think it
would take a warmer lady than
Mother Earth to make such a hor
ror possible," he maintains.
Dr. Wallace Sterling will intro
duce Dr. Millikan, a former col
league at Cal Tech.
Dr. Millikan will arrive on cam
pus this afternoon. Dr. and Mis.
Sterling will entertain him at a
small dinner party this evening be
fore the lecture.

durance capacity up to the maxi
mum by performing his experi
ments and research while standing
at a c'e.sk especially designed for
this purpose. He claims he "could
n't fall asleep while standing."
Religion and Science Related
As for sciencc today, Dr. Millikan
believes that there is a close asso
ciation between it and religion. This
fusion will be the theme of his talk
tonight.
"One value of the study of sci
ence." he has said, "was in learning
to differentiate between right and
wrong — what is correct and what
is incorrect. Everyone who studies
sciencc finds tliei*' is a right track
and a wrong track."
His past work helped lead to the
fission of the atom, but he is not
yet convinced that the much-dis
cussed hydrogen bomb will be able
to explode the earth out of the
universe.
"I'm si ill skeptical. I think it
would take a warmer lady than
Mother Earth to make such a hor
ror possible," he maintains.
Dr. Wallace Sterling will intro
duce Dr. Millikan, a former col
league at Cal Tech.
Dr. Millikan will arrive on cam

Sterling will entertain him at a
small dinner party this evening be
fore the lecture.


ATOM SMASHER — Dr. Robert
A. Millikan, Nobel Prize-winner
in will speak at Stanford to
night.
Nobel prize winner Dr. Robert
A. Millikan will lecture this eve
ning at 7:.'50 in Memorial Hall au
ditorium on the subject "Two Su
preme Forces in Human Progress."
Best known for his isolation and
measurement of the electron and
his photoelectric research, Dr. Mil
likan is recognized also for investi
gation of cosmic rays, which origi
nate new heavier atoms from light
er elements.
Planned to Re Athlete
The 82-year-old scientist began
his career by a chance incident
during his undergraduate days at
Oberlin College. Until his junior
year, young Millikan's main inter
est centered around Obcrlin's ath
letic department. After competing
successfully in the 100- and 220-
yard dashes, he continued working
his way through school as a stu
dent assistant in gymnasium classes.
Then in his third year, a profes
sor asked him to teach a class in
physics. The need for additional
money drove him to accept the job,
although he had no knowledge of
the subject at all.
His plans to become a gym in
structor were quickly abandoned.
From the start Millikan became so
absorbed in his new job that he
whs determined to be a physicist.
Wins Nohel Prize
The scientist believes that this
creation of new elements is evi
dence that a Creator has provided
for the continuance of the uni
verse. The fusion of religion and
science will be the theme of his
talk.
Dr. Millikan retired in 1946 as

j administrative head of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology, where
lie had taught and done research
1 since ID2I. He won the Nobel Prize
in 1f,23 for work he had previously
conducted at the University of Chi
cago.
He has also studied at Columbia
University and the Universities of
Berlin and Goettingen. During
| World War I he was vice-chairman
and executive officcc, ( of the National
Research Council.
Dr. Millikan enn look back over

his life's work and count 20 honors
from nine countries and 17 books,
plus his autobiography.
This list of triumphs was largely
the result of working from l(i to 20
hours a day. He pushed his en
