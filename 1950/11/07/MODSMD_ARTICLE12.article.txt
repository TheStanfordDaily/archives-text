# RHODES GRANTS
## 6 Students Nominated 
### 
Six Stanford students have been
nominated by a faculty committee
for consideration by state selection
committees as possible candidates
for Rhodes Scholarships.
Three of the men were recom
mended to the California State
Committee of Selections.
They are William P. Slusser, John
B. Blinks, and Roper Schwartz.
Slusser is a history major; Blinks,
biology; and Schwartz, international
relations.
The Stanford faculty committee
made the following further nomina
tions:
To the Oregon State Committee
of Selection, Thomas A. Bartlett,
political science major. To the Ne
braska Committee of Selection,
John E. Merriam, history major. To
the Oklahoma Committee of Selec
tion, Frederick A. F. Berry, who
received his B.S. degree in geology
from Stanford last year and is now
doing graduate work at Yale.
Professor Philip W. Buck, chair
man of the Stanford Committee on
Selections, explained that the se
lection of Rhodes Scholars is done
on a regional basis. Six states com
pose a region. Regional committees
meet 12 candidates, two from each
state.
Four out of the 12 candidates arc
selected from each of eight regions
in the U.S., making a total of 32
successful candidates each year
from the entire nation.
