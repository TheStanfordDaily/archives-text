# Douglas-Nixon and Warren-Roosevelt Races Will End Today
## Nitery Open During Voting 
### CORNELIA LITTLE 
California goes to the polls
today.
Its voters will help determine
whether the Democrats maintain
their control of Congress for the
next two years.
In California as in many other
states the fate of prominent or prom
ising figures in national politics will
be decided.
Large Turnout In Sight
And an expected turnout of 4,000,-
000 voters will choose state and local
officials and pass on the merits of
state and local referendum proposals.
The most exciting of the statewide
races promises to he that of Richard
Nixon and Helen Gahagan Douglas,
both California members of the
House of Representatives, for a scat
in the Senate.
Whether Earl Warren will hold the
governorship for his third term will
also be decided, though the odds are
that he will defeat Democratic nom
inee James Roosevelt with no trouble.
Warren, sure of the Republicans, has
been waging an energetic campaign
to take and keep Democratic and
labor votes away from the Demo
cratic candidate. His hard-to-beat
record as governor is expected to
help him retain the office.
Goodwin Knight, who is nominated
on both major party tickets, is unop
posed for re-election as lieutenant
governor.
The other major state racc is for the
attorney generalship. Democrat Ed
mund '"Pat," Brown, San Francisco
district attorney, and former Repub
lican state chairman Edward Shat
tuck, arc generally rated equal in in
tegrity and ability, though observers
say that chances are Shattuck will be
elected along with the rest of the
Republican state ticket.
Eleven Referendum Issues
Eleven statewide referendum pro
posals will be voted on; those most
intensely campaigned for, and the

ones that demand the most careful
reading and interpretation are No. 1,
to repeal the personal property tax;
No. 6, legalizing gambling and setting
up a powerful gambling commission;
and No. 10, requiring a referendum
in any area where a federal housing
project is planned.
Among the other propositions, and
not previously covered in the Daily,
arc No. 3, directing the reorganiza
tion of inferior courts; No. 4, stating
that persons may vote in the precinct
or county from which they moved if
they moved to another precinct or
county within a ccrtain time before
the election; and No. 11, making a
change in a little-used land regis
tration procedure.
Nixon-Douglas Baffle
The Nixon-Douglas campaign is
hot hut no hotter than many other
such contests throughout the coun
try, and as in many of the others,
the Democratic candidate is standing
on the principles and pointing to the
achievements of the Truman admin
istration,
Nixon claims, however, that Com
munism is the issue, pointing to his
activities on the House Un-American
Committee and Mrs. Douglas' "weak
record on opposing Communism."

Polls will he set up today in the
Nitery for voters registered in the
Stanford precinct of Santa Clara
County. The room will he reserved
for voting between 7 a.m. and 7
p.m.


PERSONAL TOUCH—James Roosevelt, Democratic candidate
for governor of California, lends a personal touch to his cam
paigning at El Monte, Calif., as he listens to questions and opinions
of Joseph P. Cantin (left) regarding pensions.

state and local referendum proposals.
The most exciting of the statewide
races promises to he that of Richard
Nixon and Helen Gahagan Douglas,
both California members of the
House of Representatives, for a scat
in the Senate.
Whether Earl Warren will hold the
governorship for his third term will
also be decided, though the odds are
that he will defeat Democratic nom
inee James Roosevelt with no trouble.
Warren, sure of the Republicans, has
been waging an energetic campaign
to take and keep Democratic and
labor votes away from the Demo
cratic candidate. His hard-to-beat
record as governor is expected to
help him retain the office.
Goodwin Knight, who is nominated
on both major party tickets, is unop
posed for re-election as lieutenant
governor.
The other major state racc is for the
attorney generalship. Democrat Ed
mund '"Pat," Brown, San Francisco
district attorney, and former Repub
lican state chairman Edward Shat
tuck, arc generally rated equal in in
tegrity and ability, though observers
say that chances are Shattuck will be
elected along with the rest of the
Republican state ticket.
Eleven Referendum Issues
Eleven statewide referendum pro
posals will be voted on; those most

ones that demand the most careful

up a powerful gambling commission;
and No. 10, requiring a referendum
in any area where a federal housing
project is planned.
Among the other propositions, and
not previously covered in the Daily,
arc No. 3, directing the reorganiza
tion of inferior courts; No. 4, stating
that persons may vote in the precinct
or county from which they moved if
they moved to another precinct or
county within a ccrtain time before
the election; and No. 11, making a
change in a little-used land regis
tration procedure.
Nixon-Douglas Baffle
The Nixon-Douglas campaign is
hot hut no hotter than many other
such contests throughout the coun
try, and as in many of the others,
the Democratic candidate is standing
on the principles and pointing to the
achievements of the Truman admin
istration,
Nixon claims, however, that Com
munism is the issue, pointing to his
activities on the House Un-American
Committee and Mrs. Douglas' "weak
record on opposing Communism."
