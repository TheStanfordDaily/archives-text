# The
						Surprise Contract

The news of a new contract for Coach
Marchie Schwartz came as a definite surprise to
most Stanford students and alumni.
His record of wins and losses while on the
Farm has not been sparkling; in fact to most
people it has been very discouraging.
However several factors must be considered
in making value judgments of the Athletic
Board's recommendation of the five year con
tract.
Marchie has been handicapped in some
ways. He has not received the necessary funds
to build up a giant football machine as have
many of our competitors in the Pacific Coast
Conference.
The junior varsity program has been terribly
weak. Lack of money and the necessary full
time staff has been the main cause for this situa
tion. It is certain that the Athletic Board's rec
ommendation of an accelerated junior varsity
program must be achieved before the varsity
team will be strong enough in bench power to
withstand the platoon systems of such teams as
Cal, USC, and Army.
With an expanded financial program, which
seems forthcoming from the SAB action, Mar
chie will have funds available for developing a
top-level coaching staff. It is essential that he
scour the country for additional assistants or
coaching replacements and not "spare the
horses."
Marchie's very strength as a gentleman and a
friend to all his associates make it doubly hard
for him to change his staff to producc a winning
football program. But to get the support and
confidence of prospective high school players,
present football players, and the student body,
he must build a solid groundwork for a win
ning team.
Secondly Marchie has been handicapped by
too great a buildup in the press and national
magazines. With the pressure of the "team to
beat" sign hanging around your neck and
alumni agitators beating their drums, it is very
difficult for any man to concentrate on building
a team up to its potential.
Look at USC. They, with Stanford, were

picked to win on the Cotfet by the pre-season
crystal ball gazers.
Thirdly Marchie is stymied by the very na
ture of Stanford itself. It is hard on a coach to
see athlete after athlete walk away from the
Registrar's office with a grade average just a
point or two below par on the Stanford course.
However Marchie has seemingly had the
material. The "horses" are there. It is a ques
tion of mental preparation of the team as much
as technical preparation.
The rough and tough football of today re
quires more of the "rock-'em, sock-'em" dis
cipline — a fighting spirit which Schwartz's
teams have not all had.
The Athletic Board wants Stanford victories
just as much as the students do. The SAB mem
bers expect Marchie to keep Stanford in the top
bracket consistently and on the top rung on the
ladder every four or five years.
This may mean we will win two or three
years in a row and then have a victory famine
for seven more. In any case the Athletic Board
feels that such a won and lost cycle is "in the
cards" if Stanford places its faith and fortunes
in the hands of Marchie.
Monday morning quarterbacking is easy for
those outside the huddle, but the fact remains
the play has been called. It is now up to Stan
ford to make the play work and keep the Uni
versity in the top ten.
