# For Senior Preference
## 
### 
The words "senior preference" have tradi
tionally acted as a red flag to non-senior Stan
ford women. Almost automatically they raise
the traditional objections—
(1) All the seniors will rush with their bags
onto the Row, crowding the sophomores into
Lagunita and Branner. (2) There will be no con
tinuity in each house from year to year since
most of the house will graduate each June. (3)
House unity will disintegrate. Sophomores will
be outvoted by the seniors and will feel out of
place. (4) The duties—wakeup, telephone, etc.
will fall onto the upper classmen.
We are in favor of senior preference, with
juniors and sophomores fighting for the vacan
cies that are left.
There are many seniors who do not wish to
live on the Row, who do not want the forced
group activity necessary in Row houses. With
senior preference, we do not believe the prob
lem of lux at the end of the year will be much
greater than it is now.

This year, for example, most seniors who
wished to live on the Row were placed there,
and yet the sophomores have not been crowded
off. Nor do we feel that house unity depends
on whether women are juniors or seniors. Liv
ing in a house together creates its own unity.
Allowing a senior to live where she chooses
her last year on the Farm is to us important—
more important than giving the bulge in the
ratio to sophomores.
An easy way to make sure that no one house
is composed of all seniors is to give the seniors
preference, but to spread them evenly over all
the Row houses.
It is the freshmen who have most often been
opposed to senior preference. But each fresh
man should remember that if she is not lucky
enough to draw where she wishes for iier
sophomore year, she will probably want some
system to insure satisfactory housing by her
senior year. —A.M.L.
