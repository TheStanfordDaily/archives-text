## Reaction Against Schwartz 
### 
To the Editor:
A maximum of 20 per cent of the student body is in
favor of retaining our present football coach. The re
mainder are energetically opposed to him or have
been reduced to a level of disinterest because of the
degredation heaped on football under his alleged
leadership.
'J he widespread opposition to the present coach has
realized that to express fully its disgust in mid-season
would only heighten team dissension and lower
morale.
Now is not the time lo have ail all-out campaign
against Schwartz.
Neither is it the time for awarding a new contract.
Hut the sudden inopportune announcement of contract
plans may inspire demonstrations by those who ;;till
hope lor a healthy Stanford football reputation.
Let's stop Stanford's biggest charity.
