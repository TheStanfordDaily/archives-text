# Not Red-Faced
## 
### 
Dear Sir:
It is not clear whether the Daily was being factual
or funny when it wrote in Friday's edition "It was
the red-facpd Economics Department that uttered the
loudest yelps after the programs."
It may be that the Department would have yelped
if it liad been red-faced. It might have been red
faced if it had listened to the program. Hut it did not
listen to the program.
Sincerply,
E. S. SHAW
Executive Head
