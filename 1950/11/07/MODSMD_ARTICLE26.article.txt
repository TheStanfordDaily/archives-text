# Not a Politician
## 
### 
To the Editor:
1 have just read with great interest Wednesday's ac
count ol Plii Alpha Delta's successful effort to remove
the Caucasian limitation on membership from its con
stitution. Ol particular interest was the following
statement attributed to me in part; viz., ". . . and ac
cording to delegates Irving JalTe and Gene Cannon,
careful planning and persuasive appeals on the con
vention floor."
While not professing any intimacy with the opera
tions of your profession it would seem to me that or
dinary courtesy (if not journalistic accuracy) would
require that "quoted one" be sought out and his per
mission obtained. Thus, you can imagine my surprise
when in oint ol fact (a) I never met your reporter,
(b) I never made such a statement, and (c) I did not
make a "persuasive appeal" on the floor of the con
vention.
Although, I'm sure your writer meant to he com
plimentary, resort to such "speech making" tactics
probably reflects on my abilities as a politician. For
the record, let me state that my activity was largely
confined to an intimate presentation of views before
hand.
With boundless good wishes for the continued suc
cess of your pupblication, I am,
Your most ob't. servant,
IHVING JAFTE
