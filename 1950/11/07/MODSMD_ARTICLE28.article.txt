# Burier of Diploma Returns to Front
## 
### 
Lieutenant Charles M. Hunter, the 23-year-old Army officer who
buried his Stanford diploma in Korea, is back in the middle of the
war again. Hunter is now an artillery observer, having graduated
from the cavalry. He returned to the front after a brief "rest" since
August in a hospital in Japan.
Hunter graduated from Stanford and the ROTC in December,

1949. By April he was in Japan,
and, like other servidfcmen, wrote
home glowing accounts of the easy
life there.
Two months later he was in the
thick of battle, leading a platoon
for the First Cavalry Division. In
a letter to a Stanford friend, Mar
tin Katz, Hunter writes of the
grimness of war he has experi
enced in Korea. The letter, dated
Oct. 27, was received here four
days later:
"You ascertain correctly, my fel
low, that this hoy has been busy.
First arrived in Korea on 18 July
with First Cavalry Division at Po
hang, east coast.
"Moved by rail to south of Taejon
for the bloody July days. We were
always outnumbered 10 to 1 and
suffered terrific casualties. We had
no replacements, food, or good wa
ter. All my friends were killed. Of
our group of six in Japan, I am sole
survivor.
"Had an outpost of one platoon
when fiot surrounded by 250 or so
Reds. In two days' battle, was al
most only one to get out alive.
"Managed to last until early

August when got carried out to
Japan hospital. Got fixed rapidly
and came back for round two
on Inchon invasion. Switched
branches and became an artillery
air observer. Had enough infan
try close combat.
"Having a bit easier time this
trip, in that artillery is better—we
ride. Ride in back seat of air liai
son plane and direct 155-mm. how
itzer fire and also do some work
behind lines. Carry machine gun
in my lap, and hand grenades to
throw out the window!
"Have picked up a Russian
"burp" gun from Red I captured
who was posing as a South Korean.
We were in direct support of the
First Marine Division in Inchon in
vasion—went to Seoul and north to
38th parallel.
"Were pulled out of lines and
sent south overland to Pusan. Was
a nightmare of a drive with snipers,
infiltration, and mortar fire. One
shell landed in back of a C xG truck
loaded with personnel.
"Traveled down HEARTBREAK
HIGHWAY where last July we
lost so many valiant men. Got
on boats at Pusan in a tremen
dous convoy, with ships as far as
you could see. Moved into this
G.I). North Korea, soon will move
to Manchuria border. Weather
only 20 degrees Fahrenheit now,
but prepared vehicles fcv winter
of minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
Won't be fun. Marty: guess the
job must be done."
Hunter finished his letter by say
ing with true American (and Stan
ford) spirit: "Let us now talk about
something more pleasant than war
and the mud houses of Korea.
Know no better subject than wom
en. God bless them and save them
till I get home again."
Hunter's diploma was sent him
by the University last June. He
buried it along the Naktong River
so he wouldn't have to carry it
through the fighting. When the
fighting ends, he hopes to go back
and unearth it.
