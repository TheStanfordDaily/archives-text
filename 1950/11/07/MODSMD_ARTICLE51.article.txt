# TV Is Cutting Attendance At Conference Grid Games
## Southland Suffers Largest Cut With 770,000 Sets in Area 
### LARRY CAHN 
Television, the latest menace to football attendance, has taken
its toll of Stanford gate receipts, according to Don Liebendorfer,
Stanford Director of Publicity.
Although Stanford crowds have dropped off, the decrease can
not begin to compare with the decline in Southern California at-

tendance. Of course there are 770,000
television sets in the south, while
the Bay Area has only 65,000 re
ceivers.
The ratio of TV sets in the south
to those in this locale is better than
ten to one. This possibly accounts
for the tremendous attendance drop
n Smogland as compared with the
meager Bay Area decline.
Three-Million Potential
It is estimated that five persons
per set view a television program
On this basis, a potential three mil
lion may watch a Stanford game or
TV. What is more probable is that
a portion of this viewing audienct
would be in actual attendance if the
game were not being televised.
Liebendorfer says that there are
no concrete figures available, bul
obviously television hurt attend
ance at the Washington and USC
games.
Stanford's new policy of reduced
non-reserved end zone ticket sales
also substantiates this. That is, all
non-reserved end zone seats are not
put on sale until game day. There
fore, individuals contemplating at
tending the game, but who during
the week are dubious because of
weather, illness, or other domestic
problems, are able to obtain good
end zone seats on the day of the
game on a first come, first served
basis.
No End Zone Sales
However, even with this policy,
there were no end zone sales at the
Washington or USC games. Al
though bad weather threatened for
the Husky game, normally there
would have been crowds of 60,000
instead of 35,000 for both the Wash
ington and the USC games.
The. UCLA-Stanford game ordi
narily would have drawn 90,000 but
only attracted 58,000, still the big
gest crowd to fill the Coliseum this
year. Liebendorfer estimates that
gate receipts from the Bruin game
fell off $90,000 from previous non
televised UCLA games.
It was expressed by the Los An
geles press that a crowd of 58,000
was remarkable. This can be at
tributed to the excellent job done
in the southern area by Stanford's
publicity vtaff the week prior to the
game. Incidentally, as comparison,
the UCLA-Oregon State game last
Saturday drew 15,000.
Complex Problem
The problem of television is
complex one. Primarily, football at
Stanford, as at almost every other
institution of learning, bears the
burden of the costs of all the other
University athletics. Stanford does
not make money in any sport but
football. Therefore, unless money
is made from football gate receipts,
the athletic budget will show red.
Another problem is that of play
ing in an empty stadium. Even if
the University is subsidized for a
loss in gate receipts, would it be
worth while playing to a sparsely
filled stadium? What would happen
to the spirit, the bands, the rooting
sections, the vendors, and every

thing else that goes to make college
football the colorful game that it
is? Only time will tell.
Stanford has always been 100 per
cent for television, assured Lieben
dorfer. He says, "Stanford was the
first school on the Coast to assume
a full home-game television sched
ule, and it is our sincerest desire tc
bring our games into the homes
of alumni, shut-ins, and Stanford
friends." But he adds, "We can
only continue to televise the games
as long as it doesn't cut our life
line" (gate receipts).
Conference Decides
However, it is the Pacific Coast
Conference as a whole which de
cides whether or not games will
continue to be televised. This year
the sponsors, Admiral and Hoffman,
only wanted to telecast games in
:his and the Los Angeles areas, ex
cluding games played in the north.
But the Conference demanded a
oackage deal and that is what cur
rently is being done.
There are several possible solu
tions to the problem. One is pre
senting post-game telecasts. That
is, game movies would be televised
on the Monday following the game.
Another possible solution is for the
sponsors to subsidize the Univer
sity for a percentage of the loss in
gate receipts. \
Follow Pattern of Radio
In the opinion of Liebendorfer,
television will no doubt follow the
same general pattern as radio. The
individual's interest in a team or a
player will motivate that individual
to going to a game to see his team
or favorite star in action.
But after seeing that team or
player once or twice, when a con
flict arises, such as weather, traffic
snarls, or other engagements, indi
viduals instead of bucking such
problems prefer to remain in the
comfort of their homes. That has
occurred in the past with radio, and
now with the addition of sight to
sound the situation will increase,
but to what extent is uncertain.
As far as next year goes? Well,
that is up to a Conference decision
which will be forthcoming at the
end of this season when all figures
have been accounted.
