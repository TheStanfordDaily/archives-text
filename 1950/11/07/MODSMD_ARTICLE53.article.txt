WHO'S GOT THE PIGSKIN?—This was the that caused such controversy in Saturday's 7
to 7 tie game between Stanford and USC. A third-quarter pass from Indian quarterback, Gary
Kerkorian, to Bill McColl (center) came down on the USC 10-yard line with both McColl and
Trojan Frank Gifford (left) fighting for possession, while John Williams (29) came up to assist.
Field Judge Pete Lenz gave the ball to USC, ruling that McColl never had possession.
