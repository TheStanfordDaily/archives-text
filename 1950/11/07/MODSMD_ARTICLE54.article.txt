# Pappy Quakes, Thinking Of The Big9 Bad Bruins

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8 (UP)â€”
UCLA will be tougher for the Cali
fornia Bears to hurdle this Satur
day than Washington was last,
Coach Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf
warned today.
Looking ahead to the important
clash that could knock the Bears
out of the Rose Bowl, the portly
coach said the game could be rated
no better than a toss-up.
"UCLA will be tougher for us
than Washington," Waldorf said.
"The Bruins have the toughest
defense on the West Coast and
one of the best in the nation.
We've got a lot of respect for that
club.
"They have a well-knit line and
have wonderful organization. They
will be exceptionally hard for us to
gain against.
"Besides that they have the best
kicking game in the West.
"It looks like an extremely tough,
even game and we'll have to play
up to the Washington game to get
an even break."
Waldorf pointed out that his own
team had "reached maturity" in
the Washington battle and that the
unit "had jelled." He especially
lauded his defensive unit that bot

tied up the Husky offense most of
the time.
The coach looks for a great
battle with UCLA, and the game
probably will draw close to a ca
pacity crowd of 80,000 fans to the
Berkeley Memorial Stadium. Nor
rie West, California athletic pub
licity director, said that there still
were 20,000 tickets for sale, how
ever.
Meanwhile, Coach Red Sanders
of UCLA sent word north that his
club would be in fine condition for
the tilt.
"We have a most confusing team,"
said Sanders, via Vic Kelly, his
publicity man. "At the start of the
season we expected a good back
field, not much of a line. Now we
have one of the very best lines.
"If I only had Les Richter, the
California linebacker, to go with
our own Donn Moomaw, I would be
able to coach the team from a rock
ing chair."
California has to win both this
game and the one against Stanford
on Nov. 25 to win the Rose Bowl
race. A loss in either game, while
Washington wins its remaining
tilts, still would put the Huskies
into the Pasadena classic.
