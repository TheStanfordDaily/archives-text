# Betas Dump ATO 18 to 6
## 
### 
The Beta II hoys turned out en
masse yesterday to play and win
one of the few intramural football
contests (five were forfeited)
against the ATO II's by an 18 to 6
score.
The Betas pushed over two tallies
early in the first half on passes from
quarterback Duke Johnson to half
back Bill Kneass. Both conversion
attempts failed and the Betas led
12 to 0.
The Betas' opening second - half'
attack was sparked by the pass-re
ceiving of Sam Young and Jack Ten
Eyke. Ten Eyke set up the third
Beta TD when he charged through
the ATO wall to block a punt. A
poss to Harlow Rothert was good
for six Beta points and the B-boys
led 18 to 6.
Late in the final half, the fourth
Beta drive was broken up as
George Kamerer intercepted a pos
sible Beta scoring pass on his own
five-yard line. The final score:
Beta II 18, ATO II 6.
In the only other game of the
day, Stern III came from behind to
trounce a hard-hitting Stern II ag
gregation, 27 to 19. Ray Heinbeck,
Stern II quarterback, led his boys
to a 19 to 7 half-time lead, only to
be defeated in the final half by the
brilliant passing attack of Tom
Glikbarg, who tossed three TD
passes and ran 70 yards to score the
other Stern III tally, making the
final score Stern III 27, Stern II 19.
