# Italian 'Faust and Devil' Has American Touches
## 
### ROY HEMMING 
"Faust and the Devil," noW playing at the Guild in Menlo Park,
is one of the best screen adaptations that has yet been made by the
Italians of a popular opera.
Somewhat ironically, it is not one of their pwn Italian operas,
but a Frenchman's musical setting of a German legend (Gounod

and Goethe, of course).
To make it even more interna
tional, the picture was made in
Rome by Gregor Rabinovitch with
help from the U.S.'s Columbia Pic
tures. An underlying American

slant is obvious
in the editing,
as well as in the
care and taste
of the produc
tion.
The sound
track is one of
the film's best
features, repro-

ducing the opera voices and Rome's
St. Cecilia Orchestra (formerly Di
Sabata's Augusteo Symphony) with
much more fidelity than Italian pic
tures have in the past. ,
Italo Tajo, of the San Francisco
and Metropolitan Operas, is physi
cally and vocally fine as the Devil,
although his role requires him to
be more restrained and less beguil
ing a Devil than most popular con
ceptions depict.
Gino Mattera and Nelly Corradi,
who suffered together through Ra
binovitch's "Lost One" ("La Tra
viata"), play Faust and Marghe
rita somewhat artificially—but ac
tually little else can be expected
when they have to burst into arias
with every other line.
As with most opera adaptations,
much of "Faust and the Devil"
tends to be static. But to those who
like good music presented without
overstuffed tenors and sopranos, the
Guild's new attraction will provide
good entertainment.
