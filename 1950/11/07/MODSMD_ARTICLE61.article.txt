# Appeals Granted By Men's Council
## 
### 
Two appeals on traffic tickets
were granted at the Thursday night
meeting of Men's Council.
The students involved were
parked on the road behind Encina
Commons. The thoroughfare is us
ually blocked to all but official cars,
but because of road construction
the posts at both entrances were
removed.
The Council, basing its judgment
on the fact that there was no fair
warning of the restriction, allowed
the appeal.
It was stressed, however, that
parking on roads normally blocked
by posts, even if they should be
temporarily removed, is illegal.
