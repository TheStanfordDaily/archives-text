"The death of George Bernard
Shaw Wednesday cut the last great
link with the 19th century." This
is the opinion of Professor William
Irvine of the English Department,
whose book "The Universe of GBS"
was published last year.
According to Irvine, Shaw lived
so long that people were in the
habit of his permanence. Although
literary men usually live to an old
age, few have left such a large fol
lowing as Shaw. Irvine commented
that although Shaw's death was a
very sad event, solemnity is inap
propriate.
Shaw himself said that a man past
60 should be shot. On the other
hand, the modern British humorist
believed that a man would never be
good until he reached the age of
300.
"The death of Shaw is the death
of a great man," said Irvine. Shaw
believed that a man should want to
be mourned by others besides his
next of kin. Today Shaw is being
mourned by people all over the
world.
