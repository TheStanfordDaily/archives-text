# Marchie to Head West Team Jan. 1
## 
### 
BULLETIN
Coach Marchie Schwartz will be head coach of the West team in the
East-West game in San Francisco on New Year's Day. This announce
ment was made by Bill CofTman, director of the annual Shriners' classic,
yesterday morning. The news was generally made known here on
campus only late last night.

A pleased head coach said yesterday that he was "very happy
to accept the contract" offered him by the Stanford Athletic Board
and President Wallace Sterling.
At the same time, student reaction to Marchie Schwartz's new
five-year contract was one of disapproval. Dissatisfaction with the

coaching staff itself and the time at
which the contract was offered was
expressed by many students through
out the day.
The dissenters appeared to be in
the majority among the students, but
this feeling was not shared by the
alumni and sports writers.
Last night several fraternities were
planning definite action in an attempt
to resist Schwartz's new contract.
However, with the exception of a
few so-called "red hots" among Stan
ford sports fans outside the student
body, the majority of the alumni and
friends of the team gave the contract
their blessing, according to Stanford
officials in contact with these people.
Sports writers to whom the story
was released late Sunday evening
were unanimous in their approval,
according to Athletic Information Di
rector Don Liebendorfer. Another
source said that feeling in Palo Alto
among Stanford fans appeared to be
90 per cent in favor of the contract.
Meanwhile, talk of petitions to the
Board of Trustees and the SAB was
evident among the members of the

student body. No concerted action to
have the contract voided was in cvi
dancc, however.
Most of the grumbling was based
upon the team's past record, particu
larly in this season when Stanford
was heralded to be one of the Coast's
best. Some of the critics complained
that the SAB passed upon the con
tract in too much haste.
President Sterling, back from a
two weeks' trip through the East, put
aside the pile of business that had
accumulated during this period to
hear student opinion on the contract.
At the end of the afternoon he said
he had nothing more to add to his
statement made Sunday evening,
when he said, "I take pleasure in ap
proving this recommendation and
shall he proud to submit it to the
Board of Trustees."
The action of the Board of Trustees
on the contract is cxpccted to be in
complete accord with the President
and the SAB.
At practice yesterday, Schwartz
said, "I'm very happy with the con
tract and delighted to work with this
swell bunch of boys."
(For editorial comment, sec page
2.)

A disorganized hand of about
200 students gathered at the Post
Office at 10 last night and chanted
"Down with Marchie!" in re
sponse to anonymous phone calls
made to campus living units.
Before long, embittered observ
ers. including members of the
varsity team, shoved their way
into the crowd and defended the
coach with hot language. Said
one player, "Why don't you go
and talk to the football players?
You can't tell anything from the
stands."

East-West game in San Francisco on New Year's Day. This announce
ment was made by Bill CofTman, director of the annual Shriners' classic,
yesterday morning. The news was generally made known here on
campus only late last night.

A pleased head coach said yesterday that he was "very happy
to accept the contract" offered him by the Stanford Athletic Board
and President Wallace Sterling.
At the same time, student reaction to Marchie Schwartz's new
five-year contract was one of disapproval. Dissatisfaction with the

coaching staff itself and the time at
which the contract was offered was
expressed by many students through
out the day.
The dissenters appeared to be in
the majority among the students, but
this feeling was not shared by the
alumni and sports writers.
Last night several fraternities were
planning definite action in an attempt
to resist Schwartz's new contract.
However, with the exception of a
few so-called "red hots" among Stan
ford sports fans outside the student
body, the majority of the alumni and
friends of the team gave the contract
their blessing, according to Stanford
officials in contact with these people.
Sports writers to whom the story
was released late Sunday evening
were unanimous in their approval,
according to Athletic Information Di
rector Don Liebendorfer. Another
source said that feeling in Palo Alto
among Stanford fans appeared to be
90 per cent in favor of the contract.
Meanwhile, talk of petitions to the
Board of Trustees and the SAB was
evident among the members of the

student body. No concerted action to
have the contract voided was in cvi
dancc, however.
Most of the grumbling was based
upon the team's past record, particu
larly in this season when Stanford
was heralded to be one of the Coast's
best. Some of the critics complained
that the SAB passed upon the con
tract in too much haste.
President Sterling, back from a
two weeks' trip through the East, put
aside the pile of business that had
accumulated during this period to
hear student opinion on the contract.
At the end of the afternoon he said
he had nothing more to add to his
statement made Sunday evening,
when he said, "I take pleasure in ap
proving this recommendation and
shall he proud to submit it to the
Board of Trustees."
The action of the Board of Trustees
on the contract is cxpccted to be in
complete accord with the President
and the SAB.
At practice yesterday, Schwartz
said, "I'm very happy with the con
tract and delighted to work with this
swell bunch of boys."

A disorganized hand of about
200 students gathered at the Post
Office at 10 last night and chanted
"Down with Marchie!" in re
sponse to anonymous phone calls
made to campus living units.
Before long, embittered observ
ers. including members of the
varsity team, shoved their way
into the crowd and defended the
coach with hot language. Said
one player, "Why don't you go
and talk to the football players?
You can't tell anything from the
stands."
