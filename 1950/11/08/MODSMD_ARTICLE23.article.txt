The appointment oI Coach Marchie Schwartz
as head coach of the West squad for the Shrine
game on New Year's Day came at a very sig
nificant time. As a postscript to the renewal of
Marchie's contract, the action by the East-West
Game committee shows that others in the foot
ball business have faith in the Stanford coach.
Whether or not the campus is in accord with
the earlier SAB move, there can be nothing but
congratulations to Marchie on his newest ap
pointment a real honor.

We v/ere amazed at the large turnout for last
week's Excom meeting. It is encouraging to
know that over 60 students have active interest
in student government.
it is interesting to hear some of the arguments
which students present from the floor as the stu
dent council considers a difficult problem. Stu
dents can learn a great deal by attending Excom
meetings and expressing their opinions.
One student observed that Stanford has not

won a football game since Li'l Ugh stopped his
antics in front of the rooting section. Maybe
there was something to that Injun fellow.
Stanford police have been warning fraterni
ties to keep someone in their houses when
everyone goes to the football game. Every year
at least one house is robbed before the sugges
tion is followed.
Paying the cook a few extra dollars seems
like good insurance to stop losses to the stu
dents.

Women are still complaining about the little
kids who swipe pompons and red feathers at the
games. Even worse are the "bigger kids" who
ruii ( off with the hats belonging to the visiting
band members. One of those Trojan band hats
was probably worth about 20 rooters' caps in
dollars and cents, plus a lot of poor relations be
tween USC and Stanford students.
