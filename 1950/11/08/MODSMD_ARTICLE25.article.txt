# CAMPUS OPINION
## Do We Want a Winning Team? 
### 
To the Editor:
We wish to express our disapproval of the procedure
of the Sunday Athletic Board in calling its quickie
meeting to extend a five-year contract to a head coach
who lias not produced a winning football team in Jive
years. We believe that his record, and student-alumni
opinion, both extremely important, should have been
fiven more consideration.
It will be pointed out that students and alumni, as
well as faculty, are represented on the SAB; but it
would be difficult to find large segments of these
gioups who feel that they were in fact represented at
the Sunday meeting. We feel that the decision of the
beard doe;: not represent student-alumni opinion, and
that little was done to ascertain that opinion.
Stanford Spirit, often mentioned lightly, cannot be
completely ignored. Stanford Spirit, 'it will be agreed,
â€¢ manates at least partially from the students and
alumni, who actually contribute a good part to support
Stanford football. This spirit can hardly be maintained
il it is given voice only when led by Red Dog Hender
son.
We question the procedures of the SAB, and we
question its motives as well. If the board wishes to
He-emphasize football, we think it has taken the right
course. If il wishes to produce winning teams in the
next five years, we think it has taken the wrong course.
The University of Chicago plays no football. A long
tring ol lor.ses neither produced sufficient income, nor
built sufficient character to warrant meeting schools
If/at itill played football.
I.et Stanford not become the Chicago of the West.
