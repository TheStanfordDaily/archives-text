# Representation on SAB
## 
### 
7'o the Editor:
We understand that last year the old SAC was re
placed with a new athletic board (SAB) in order to
give the students, faculty, and alumni an equal voice
in dt-ti i mining athletic policy.
And we recognize that, as students, we have no influ
ence with the faculty or alumni members of the board;
however, we feel that our opinions and the opinions of
the student body as a whole on important questions
should be made knov/n to or solicited by the student
' representatives" on the Board.
Therefore, in connection with this, we should like
to know (I) who the three student representatives are;
{'I) how they voted on Schwartz's contract; and (3) if
they voted for a continuation of the contract, did they
feel they were really acting as representatives of the
opinion held by the majority of the student body?
We wonder.
