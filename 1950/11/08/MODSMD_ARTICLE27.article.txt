# Varsity Jackets

### 
To the Editor:
Concerning your story on the front page of Monday's
paper, "Cal Games Fans Hear Bad News," I believe
that the $1,100 which has been allocated for "jackets
lor members of the varsity football team" could be
better invested in the great amount of "athletic prop
erty which needs repairs."
I believe that by so doing, this money would serve a
greater number of students in a more useful way.
I may have misunderstood what you have called
"jackets." I am in favor of giving the varsity the
usual block "S" sweaters, but I think it unnecessary
to spend additional money for what I understand to be
a special varsity football jacket.
