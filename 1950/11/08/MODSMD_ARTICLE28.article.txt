# Homecoming Judging???
## 
### 
To the Editor:
How ludicrous can a judging panel be? The an
nouncement Saturday night of the victorious house
decorations was about the worst miscarriage of justice
we ever had the misfortune of witnessing!
Now, we have no gripe against the Chi Psi and Cub
berley Houses as such but we do have one against the
basis (if any) of judging. How some painted cardboard
can win Sweepstakes over some of the really beautiful
decorations displayed Friday evening is beyond com
prehension.
To the campus as a whole, three house decorations
stood head and shoulders above the rest as top con
tenders for the Sweepstakes award. On the basis of
originality, execution, application of theme, and over
all appeal, the SAE's, Russell, and Hurlburt had no
serious competition. The SAE decoration, as most
everyone will allow, was a sight to behold and as a
result it was a show-stopper all night. Russell's two
headed monster had one and all in stitches while Hurl
buit's siren-baited Trojan trap had everyone gaping.
We don't know, maybe the judges caught a glimpse
of some ethereal beauty "bursting" forth from the
macabre affair which eventually won. Or maybe the
Homecoming house decoration chairman (who was a
member of one of the winning houses) pointed out
some hidden beauty the judges had missed.
Regardless of what the judges saw here, the point is
that the campus as a whole failed to concur. We would
appieciate it if someone would inform us of any justi
fiable criterion for the judges' decision and if none is
forthcoming inaybe it would be a good idea in the
future to let the Student Body express their opinion in
u more constructive way than belated gripes via "Let
ters to the Editor."
