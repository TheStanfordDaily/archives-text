# FOREIGN ENROLLMENT
## Farm's Foreign Students Represent 48 Countries 
### 
By SUE GOODSTEIN
Along with the current trend
in the United States to have an
ever increasing number of for
eign students enrolled in Amer- j
ican universities, Stanford now
has the largest total in its his
iory with 281 students represent
ing 48 countries throughout the
world.
Canada, China, England, and !
Germany have the largest repre- j
sentation this year, which is a slight
deviation from previous years when
India and Turkey ranked next to
Canada and China in the number
of students.
Most of the students are financed
by their families, home govern
ments, or private agencies.
Financial Difficulties
Because of the recent devaluation
of currencies in many countries, it ;
was expected that the number of i
foreign students would decrease, I
according to Willard M. Waterous, j
Foreign Students' Adviser. Last
year, the Student International Re
lief Organization of the lIR contrib
uted $500 to students who had suf
fered financially due to the devalu
ation. Others remedied the situa
tion by seeking part-time employ- i
ment.
The Chinese Emergency Aid Pro
gram has been set up in universities
by the U.S. government to pay the
expenses of those Chinese students
who have been cut off from their
homes in Communist China.
These students can be found in j
every University department, with
a majority studying engineering.
There are 191 graduate students and

90 undergraduates. The ratio is
strongly reinforced by our friends
j from abroad with 24'.', men to 38
j women.
Foreign students are distributed
|in residences in about the same
â–  proportion as other students. There
; are 37 students living in University
| residences, which include dormito
ries, fraternities, Tamarack Lodge,
and the Chinese Clubhouse; 92 in
: Stanford Village, and 152 off cam
; pus.
Social Life
A social program is especially
provided for the students, with
dances at the"I" Club, to which the
entire student body is invited, in
' addition to visits to the Cal and
Mills campuses.
When the students arrive at
Stanford for the first time, they are
\ greeted by a group of American
| students who serve as hosts and
hostesses. There were about 50 stu
[ dents this year who served on the
i hostessing committee, helping the
I students in registration and in other
j orientations.
Stanford welcomes this large to
tal of foreign students into its stu
| dent body and their participation in
campus activities. Mr. Waterous re
lated how one of the students re
marked that he was gratified to be
j treated as an individual rather than
j a representative of his country dur
ing his years on the Farm.
