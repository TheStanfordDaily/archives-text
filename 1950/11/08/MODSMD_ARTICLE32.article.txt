# 'Caesar' Chronology Presents Problems
## 
### MAGGIE BERNT 
"Julius Caesar," the play that
opens tomorrow night in Memo
rial Auditorium, has been a par
ticular problem to theater histo
rians who have tried to place
it chronologically in Shake
speare's cycle of plays.
Several early commentators have
proposed IGO7 as the date of the
composition. In the death of Queen
Elizabeth in IGO3 they find a paral
lel to the political upheaval Shake
. peare describes after the murder
of Caesar.
Later critics, however, favor an
earlier date, about IGOI, for the
play, pointing out that not Eliza
beth's death but the restlessness of
the nation during the last years of
her 45-year reign may have been
the inspiration for the play.
Material from Plutarch
Shakespeare, himself, turned to
the historian Plutarch for material
dealing with the period of the play
| from Caesar's entry into Rome, 45
8.C., to the battle of Philippi, three
years later.
Shakespeare's attitude toward
the happenings, however, is his own

and has been vigorously criticized
by historians. He sought in "Julius
Caesar" to bring out the tragedy of I
Brutus, the trusted friend of Cae- '
sar who joined his enemies to plot
his murder, instead of focusing his
attention on the tragedy of Caesar
himself.
Original Theme Presented
The production of the tragedy the
Stanford Players are presenting has
made no departures from Shake
speare's original theme. In the mat
ter of production, costuming, set
ting, and lighting have been
planned in accordance with staging
conditions Shakespeare had in mind
when he wrote the play.
Director A. Nicholas Vardac has
used all the modern means at his
disposal to present to Stanford au
diences a production of "Julius
Caesar" true to the theme of the
original.
Tickets for the production are
still on sale at the box office of Me
morial Hall. Admission is 90 cents
for all three performances, Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday nights.
Curtain time is 8:15.
