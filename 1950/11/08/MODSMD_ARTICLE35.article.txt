# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry

Stanford s iootball controversy has taken all the aspects of a Civil War,
i-iid with this has assumed all the ugliness and filth that goes with such a
••onflict. Both sides want but one thing: The Best For Stanford. They dis
agiee on what is Best for Stanford, and thus the anti-Schwartz element,
which is losing, has used every dirty trick in the book to win their point,
without realizing that in doing so they are destroying most of the wonderful
things about the school which they love.
1 hings have happened at Stanford the last two weeks which have dis
gusted und revolted me to an extreme. OK. so Marciiie Schwartz has a
renewal of his five-year contract. OK, so we've lost two football games
and there is every indication we will lose more. So What?
1-et s for one wonderful moment oi sanity look not at Los Angeles or A 1
Masters or the win-loss record. Let's look at us. Let's look at that "'great
and wonderful Stanford student body." We stink.
I here was a time, dear freshmen and sophs (you may not remember)
when it was a pretty fine feeling to be a member of the Stanford student
body. It was a distinction because—as a mass—we behaved with taste and
decency, the same way we behaved as individuals. We scorned the rabble
at Cal for their lack of manners and for their boisterous ill taste.
We lost then—gosh, how we lost—but (excuse the old line) we lost with
something akin to glory. I was very proud of us then.
Today I am ashamed of us, and maybe just a little sick to my stomach.
And that is a pretty tough way for a graduating senior to feel.
Look at us. We let the gutless wonders in the hack row at rallies (the
Homecoming rally) and the football movies make snide remarks about
our coach and our team. We let these fools, incompetents, and cowards
make the vilest remarks about these men—not as coaches and players,
but as men. With our particular set of coaches, and our particular set of
players, who are (in my mind) the greatest guys on campus, this kind of
stuff makes me want to fight; something I rarely have an inclination
lo do.
Then there was that splendid showing on the Row last night, with the
funny boys marching down the Row—not giving a damn how the guys who
i<rc* playing the game feel. Just making noise and being an ugly rabble. But
worst of all it was on the Stanford campus, composed of Stanford students—
some guys from the Village and a band from some of the local athletic clubs:
the AKLs and the Phi Kaps. To the outside, it looks like just Stanford doing
it, rather than a bunch of guys who don't have the vaguest notion of what
goes on in a football game, on a football team, in a dressing room, or a chalk
talk.
Please don't think I'm trying to defend the coaching staff or the contract.
I'm not, and if I were I would say so bluntly.
What I am saying is that the student body—yeah, you—has failed not only
Ihe coaches and the team, but yourselves. When team members tell me that
they didn't play their guts out so much last week to beat USC, but to show
the student body that they could win without them, then there is something
the matter with the student body.
Marchie Schwartz has been offered a five-year contract. Ifc will accept
it and it will be oked by the Board of Trustees. I won't pretend to be in
favor of it. There are good reasons for it that I am not permitted to dis
close. but which I can tell you assume a national scope.
We are going to build a great athletic plant at Stanford, and we are

going to have better football teams, j
I am not convinced that the prin- j
cipal reason for not having better i
tsams now is entirely the blame of '
the coaches. If I were, this column
would have an entirely different ring j
to it. Much of the blame belongs to |
the rotten conditions that modern
collegiate football is today. We are
one of the few major schools that are j
abiding by the code, that still be
lieve in some sort of decency in this
"win or else" brand of modern foot
hall. We are going to continue that
w.iy.

So, instead of being proud of our [
University's stand, we behave like j
Berkeley at its worst. Oh, we're a
great bunch.
Fortunately, there are some j
alumni who are big enough to over
ride their views for the good of
Stanford. Among those who were
opposed to Marchie Schwartz was
Jim Reynolds. It was Big Jim who
led—sources tell ine—the notorious
L.A. faction. It was Big Jim who
lought the most bitter battle against
the present coaching staff.
At the announcement that the SAB
had voted to extend Schwartz's con- j
tract, it was Jim Reynolds who
proved himself to be—indeed—a very
big man. Big in stature. Big in mind, i
Reynolds said:
"If that is what the school wants, j
then that is the way it should be.
"I don't deny I have been disap- I
pointed at times. I recently sat in a i
pool of tears watching the Indians !
bow to UCLA. But I am loyal to my !
school—and so is every Stanford man. |
Schwartz can count on my help."
That's the way the ball bounces, j
I'm not sure I like the way it has
bounced. But I am sure that I would j
like to be proud of the Stanford Stu- \
dent Body again. What's the old say- |
ing? "Splendid in victory, magnifi- 1
cent in defeat!"
Now we've got the ball, the stands
aire watching. Do we fumble or do
we score. It's up to you.
