# Cards, WSC Scrimmage
## 
### 
Both Stanford and
State ran through dummy scrim
mages yesterday in preparation for
their football tussle this Saturday
afternoon.
It was too cold and rainy for the
Cougars to practice outside, so they
went into their field house and
worked out with the frosh. WSC
j incurred no injuries in the Oregon
game.
Meanwhile, at Stanford practice,
Gordy White, the lame tackle, was
I running around and practicing
| blocking. He will probably be in
I shape for Saturday's game.
The only two missingi from prac
tice were end Ron Eadie and half
Eric Southwood. Eadie has a bad
ankle and Southwood a groin in
jury. Both are on the "maybe" list.
Blondie Broome, stellar defensive
halfback, has shaken off his ankle
injury.
