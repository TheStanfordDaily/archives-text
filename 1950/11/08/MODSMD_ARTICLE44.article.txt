# Korea Fighting Front
## 
### 

RED STRENGTH GROWSâ€”The fighting was heaviest in north
west Korea as growing Chinese Red forces forced the Allies back
four miles and captured the former west coast anchor town of
Pakchon (1). Some five to 10 miles east of Pakchon, U.S. 24th
Division troops pulled back almost a mile as Communists began
an end run around the Americans' right flank. Intelligence re
ports said other Chinese reinforcements (tank symbols) were
pouring into Unsan (2) and Huichon (3) as the Reds readied for a
new attack (brokeii arrow) on the Chongchon River line (jagged
symbol), the last natural barrier before their capital Pyongyang.
