Paintings by Morris Graves arc
the featured attraction at the new
show at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Flower arrangements by Jack Dan
iels and Edd Kincaid and Japanese
prints complete the current exhibit.
Graves is one of the foremost
opaque watercolor artists in the
Northwest. His paintings were done
in 1944 during the war. They deal
with such subject matter as birds,
snakes, trees, water, and the moon.
He creates through his subjective
painting a mood which defies de
scription. Using many dark shades,
he gives little attention to detail.
The arrangements feature unusu
al combinations of materials, colors,
and shapes. Flowers, leaves, rocks,
glass, and dead wood are all used
to create artistic and dramatic ef
fects. For the most part the ar
rangements arc surprising in their
simplicity.
The Japanese color prints show
scenes from plays and portraits of
the actors.
Sunday is the last day to see the
Morris Graves paintings and the
flower arrangements. Gallery hours
are 10 to 5 Tuesday through Sat
urday, and 12 to 4 Sunday.—Shir
