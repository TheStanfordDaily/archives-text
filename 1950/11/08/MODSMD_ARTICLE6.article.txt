# Lawyers Will Report On Oath Question
## 
### 
A report from the Stanford'
Law School discussing the con
stitutionality of holding an all
campus referendum to decide
whether a policy statement on
the loyalty oath "is within the
scope of Excom's authority" will
be read to Excom representa
tives tonight by President Ted
Buttner.
Buttner requested the interpre
tation late last week and received
it yesterday. According to the AS
SU constitution, the President is
empowered to "request from the
Dean of the Law School such an in
terpretation when he deems it nec
essary. 1 "
Buttner's action was brought
about by a petition drawn up and
circulated tbis week by Excom
Forum group chairman Carl Sto
ver and student Alberta Engvall.
Their petition reads:
"Resolved, that a policy statement
on academic freedom and loyalty
oaths for faculty members is a mat
ter for referendum ballot and is
within the scope of our association's
authority as set down in the ASSU
constitution."
Last week, a petition advocating
direct submission of the loyalty
oarii to a vote of the students was
vetoed by Excom members, who
subsequently went on record as
putting the matter outside the scope
of the body's authority. Hence the
current referendum, which pur
portedly asks the students—not Ex
com —to decide on the "scope"
question.
Other items on the Excom agenda
are as follows:
1. Roll, minutes, dates
2. Report of Student Manager
3. Thanks to Homecoming Com
mittee
4. Reports:
a) Foreign student—Karl Kis
ler
b) Campus parking situation
r) Stanford symbol
5. Question of referendum legal
ity regarding loyalty oath
question
ft. Minutes of organizations
The meeting, which is open to all
students, will begin at 7:30.
