## 
### GEORGE BUCKLEY ROY HEMMINNG 
The French have come up
with one of the year's most en-'
tertaining musicals: "The Paris
Waltz," now playing exclusive
engagements at the Larkin and
Clay in San Francisco •(with ex
cellent English titles, we might
add).
Although the composer Jacques
Offenbach and his singing star Hor
tense Schneider are the central fig
ures in the plot, "The Paris Waltz"

is not a serious
biography. Th e
encyclo
pedic facts of
their lives are
left in the back
ground; the film
offers, rather, a
segment of their
lives nnlv — as

* — it vLa oiiiy — as
well as a spirited portrayal of what
must have been the prevailing at
mosphere of the light-hearted Paris
in which they lived.
Offenbach must certainly have
found the source of his music in a
Paris such as is shown in this pic
ture —a city with the gaiety and
spark that was caught in such oper
ettas as "La Vie Parisienne," '"Or
pheus in Hades," and "La Belle He
lene."

Pierre Fresnay, the versatile star
of "M. Vincent" and "Grand Illu
sion," plays the near-sighted Offen
bach superbly; his physical appear
ance and wispy mannerisms seem
unusually faithful to the historical
accounts.
