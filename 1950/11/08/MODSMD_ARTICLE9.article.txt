# TUESDAY EVENING SERIES
## Both Science and Religion Essential, Millikan Asserts 
### TOM NEVILLE 
"Never in history has man
been forced to ask himself so
persistently 'How can I make a
better world?' " Dr. Robert A.
Millikan told a packed Tuesday
Evening Series audience in Me
morial Hall last night.
Looking to scicncc and religion
for an answer, Dr. Millikan said
neither one can give a suitable re
ply by itsell.
Scicncc, he claims, is inclined to
underrate what Alfred Whitehead
I called "world loyalty" (religion),
I and religious leaders aic prone to
| say that if "men's hearts" arc right
the world will necessarily be right,
j "Roth arc wrong," the 82-year-old
j Nobel Prize-winner said.
Hearts and Heads
Good hearts with bad heads are
J as incorrect as bad hearts with
I good heads, he continued. Science
; will lend knowledge and religion
will lend spirit to mankind, and to
; gcther "they will provide the sole
i basis for intelligent living."
"Tliey arc the two great sister
forces which have pulled and are
pulling mankind upward," Dr. Mil-
I likan stated. He identified God with
[ conscience and added that "One's
I attitude toward God is reflected in
his treatment of his fellow man."
Definition of Srienre
The speaker gave a broad defini
tion of scicncc, extending its mean
ing to all knowledge in general.
"What is best for the world is a
question for scicncc and knowledge,
pure and simple." This knowledge,

i for instance, gives us warning of
| such things as the "Malthusian hell"
!of overpopulation. If left un
| cheekcH, in this case religion will
i stifle itself by interfering with
| "world loyalty."
'Man has always been able to
! admit his ignorance," Dr. Millikan
I concluded. "Only the fool says there
is no God."
