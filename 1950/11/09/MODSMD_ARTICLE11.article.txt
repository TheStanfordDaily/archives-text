## Demos Retain Shaky Margin In Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 (UP)
—A Republican election sweep
of surprising size left the Demo
crats in shaky control of Con
gress today but definitely put
President Truman's "Fair Deal"
program on ice for at least two
years.
The Republicans also threw Demo
crats out of five governorships and
claimed a sixth victory today as elec
tion returns gave the Dewey-Warren
national ticket of 1948 a new and
stronger grip on key Statehousc
strongholds.
The Democrats came out of Tues
day's balloting with a paper-thin
majority for the 82nd Congress which
meets Jan. 3.
The indicated lineup is:
Senate—49 Democrats; 47 Repub
licans. A net gain of five for the
GOP. It takes a minimum of 49 to
win control.
House—234 Democrats; 200 Repub-

Governor Earl Warren collect
ed lf>2 votes to 57 for Roosevelt
at the three Stanford precincts
Tuesday.
Other results were:
Attorney General—Edward Shat

Senator — Richard Nixon, 310;
Helen Douglas, 198
Proposition I—Yes, 54; No, 413
Proposition 6—Yes, 27; No, 187
Proposition 10—Yes, 121; No, 372
The results printed in yester
day's Daily were incomplete.

licans; 1 independent. A net gain of
31 for the GOP. It takes 218 for a
bare majority.
The Senate battle for control was
so close that even the thin Demo
cratic margin was threatened. Sen.
William E. Benton was clected in
Connecticut over Republican Prcs
cott Bush by just 352 votes and a
recount seems almost certain. If Bush
won, it would throw the Senate into
a 18-48 tic for the first time in 70
years.
