# LOYALTY OATH REFERENDUM
## Excom Turns Down Poll Of Student Body on Policy 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
The referendum on loyalty
oaths was batted into the air
again last night by Excom, and
when it fell few of the 40 stu
dents present were completely
unconfused.
Excom's final decision was that ;
no poll "on whether a policy state
ment on academic freedom and loy
alty oaths for faculty members is j
within the scope of Excom's author
ity" would be placed on the ballot
in this election or any subsequent
election. The motion was the care
fully nursed brainchild of Phil Sae
ta, men's halls representative, and
was passed by Excom 9 to 2, with
Chuck Silver berg, sophomore class,
and Gil Jonas, ofl-campus, dissent
ing.
The battcrered referendum peti
tion, which had 171 signatures, was
replaced by a poll after five minutes
of discussion. Carl Stover, special
committee member, ,submitted the
change at the request of ASSU
President Ted Buttner after Butt
ncr read an interpretation of the
ASSU constitution by the Stanford
Law School.
The Law ricliool statement said
that "an ASSU-sponsored student
referendum on the subject of loy
alty oaths in universities is not
within the scope of the Associa
tion's authority . w
Since the ASSU Excom has the
power to decide the extent of its
authority, the statement, also : aid,
a student referendum "on whether
i a policy statement on the subject
of loyalty oaths is within the As
sociation's authority" woidd be un
constitutional since it would be le
gally binding.
Stover said that a poll of stu
dents would not he legally binding
and added that the Law School
agreed with him. Excom followed
Stover's statement with a half-hour
discussion of whether such a poll
would be morally binding and
should be submitted to the vot/v: .
The consensus of opinion was that
it would be morally binding. If the
majority of students polled ap
proved of a policy statement on
loyalty oaths, Dorothy Thomas,
women's halls, among other Excom
members, feit that she would be
morally bound to make such a
statement. Making such a state
ment, however, would reverse Ex
com's previous decision that such a
statement is not within the scope
of its authority.
Bill Betlike, men's How, also
objected to a poll. "Unfortuivde
j ly," he said, "Fxcom is both a
j judicial and a legislative body.
As a judicial body we should not
] let the students ratify or veto our
decisions.*' lie felt that in a poll
I the students Mould be ralif>iry
cr vetoing Excom's decisions.
John Traina, interested student,
said he agreed that a policy state-
I mcnt on loyalty oaths was not with
j in the scope of Excom's authority.
However, he suggested that an
amendment to the ASSU constitu
| tion was possible to put such a
j statement within Excom's author

Stover said that a poll of stu
dents would not he legally binding
and added that the Law School
agreed with him. Excom followed
Stover's statement with a half-hour
discussion of whether such a poll
would be morally binding and
should be submitted to the vot/v: .
The consensus of opinion was that
it would be morally binding. If the
majority of students polled ap
proved of a policy statement on
loyalty oaths, Dorothy Thomas,
women's halls, among other Excom
members, feit that she would be
morally bound to make such a
statement. Making such a state
ment, however, would reverse Ex
com's previous decision that such a
statement is not within the scope
of its authority.
Bill Betlike, men's How, also
objected to a poll. "Unfortuivde
j ly," he said, "Fxcom is both a
j judicial and a legislative body.
As a judicial body we should not
] let the students ratify or veto our
decisions.*' lie felt that in a poll
I the students Mould be ralif>iry
cr vetoing Excom's decisions.
John Traina, interested student,
said he agreed that a policy state-
I mcnt on loyalty oaths was not with
j in the scope of Excom's authority.
However, he suggested that an
amendment to the ASSU constitu
| tion was possible to put such a
j statement within Excom's author
ity.
The referendum on loyalty
oaths was batted into the air
again last night by Excom, and
when it fell few of the 40 stu
dents present were completely
unconfused.
Excom's final decision was that ;
no poll "on whether a policy state
ment on academic freedom and loy
alty oaths for faculty members is j
within the scope of Excom's author
ity" would be placed on the ballot
in this election or any subsequent
election. The motion was the care
fully nursed brainchild of Phil Sae
ta, men's halls representative, and
was passed by Excom 9 to 2, with
Chuck Silver berg, sophomore class,
and Gil Jonas, ofl-campus, dissent
ing.
The battcrered referendum peti
tion, which had 171 signatures, was
replaced by a poll after five minutes
of discussion. Carl Stover, special
committee member, ,submitted the
change at the request of ASSU
President Ted Buttner after Butt
ncr read an interpretation of the
ASSU constitution by the Stanford
Law School.
The Law ricliool statement said
