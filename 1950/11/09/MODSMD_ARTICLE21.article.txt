petition signed by 98 .students to the Excom for action. Excom labeled
the petition which condemned the Loyalty Oath of the University of
California as a violation of academic freedom and a threat to the ad
vancement of knowledge and truth.
Nov. 2—Excom voted 11 to 1 against another petition submitted by
Jonas and signed by 400 students. This petition advocated that the
Loyalty Oath issue fcc submitted to a vote of the students.
The majority of Excom felt that the petition for referendum was not a
matter for referendum ballot and not within the scope of the ASSU

vise and co-ordinate student discussion of issues such as the Loyalty
Oath.

statement on academic freedom and loyalty oaths for faculty members
is a matter for referendum ballot and is within the scope of the ASSU's
authority.

authority?" I
