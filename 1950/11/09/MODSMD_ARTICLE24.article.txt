# Fraternity Initiations
## 
### 
Stanford's top fraternity watchdogs -the IFB
and IFC—have decided to enforce a set of in
formal initiation rules which have been on the
books since 1939.
Specifically, we would like to take issue with
their decision to enforce Rule No. 3 of the set.
This rule reads:
"Informal initiation practices will be confined
to the house and grounds of the fraternity con
cerned."
By way of definition, "informal initiation prac
tices" are those which usually take place during
"hell week"—the week preceding formal initia
tion. Requiring pledges to wear distinctive
headgear on campus, sending them on "quests"
or "searches" of one kind or another —all are
traditional, and, in most cases, harmless parts
of informal initiations.
Unfortunately, Rule No. 3 has been in hiding
since the war's end. For the first time this year,
Interfraternity Council has brought it out of the
lule book and asked the house presidents what
they would like to do about it.
Informally, the presidents have agreed to its
enforcement. In stronger tones, the Interfrater
nity Eoard seconded the motion. Without the
rule, indicate members, Stanford leaves itself
open to the very type of incident that happened
at Cal last month: a fraternity pledge is struck
down and killed by a car while walking along a
road in Contra Costa County. The explanation?
The pledge was told to "get back to campus as
best he could."
Certainly we don't want that kind of thing
happening here. Nevertheless, we fsel Rule No.
3 is definitely NOT the right kind of msdicine
with which to prevent such incidents. More
over, the very fact that Cal DOES have a rule
similar to No. 3 doesn't seem to have lessened

the number of "informal" initiation pranks
there.
Already it is apparent that a number of cam
pus fraternities are definitely opposed to Rule
No. 3. Its very existence consists of an invita
tion to fraternities to go out and break the rule —
simply because they feel it is unfair and a
denial of their basic rights.
As a matter of fact, many houses can be justly
proud of their off-campus pre-initiation cere
monies; so much so, that a blanket enforcement
of the rule seems not at all justified.
By way of a recommendation, we would like
to see IFC get together and repe&l Rule No. 3.
In its place, we would further recommend a
brand of real and responsible leadership within
the houses, a proposal strongly supported by
Men's Counselor Richard Balch.
In commenting on the rule last Monday,
Balch indicated that "leadership—not rules" is
the key to a fraternity's success. If we were to
define that type of leadership, we would say it
was the kind that transforms every fraternity
into its own watchdog, the same kind of leader
ship that builds floats, sponsors all-campus
dances, and otheiwise makes the fraternity sys
tem a credit to the University.
While the presidents are attempting to boast
of the enforcement of a rule, they are at the
same time opening their doors to what might
easily become a rash of premeditated violations
of that rule—violations are always more "harm
ful" than the accidental ones.
Both fraternities — and their presidents —
should have nothing to be ashamed of when it
comes to initiating their members. A tongue in
cheek attitude or an attempt to "put up a good
publicity front" definitely has no place within
the fraternity circle—if that circle wants to re
main an integral part of Stanford life. —R.R.
