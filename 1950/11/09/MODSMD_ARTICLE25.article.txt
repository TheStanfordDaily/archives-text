### AL BERRY 
With the pink Chinese-fellas bursting into Korea, I
huve decided, in view of impending disaster, to scrap
n:y aims for Quad improvement—i.e., swimming pools,
gondolas, etc. Instead I will now propose a plan, which
1 am sure will be immediately snatched up by our

founding fathers, which will be
more in keeping with the current
international emergencies.
Underneath the Quad, the ugli
ness of which will be somewhat
concealed by the strategic placing
of several hundred thousand sand-
Lays, we will build the greatest
bomb-proof shelter the world has
known. It will dwarf McCor-

rnick's and make the Carlsbad Caverns look like a
gopher hole.
'J he fir: t step in this project is, as you might suspect,
to dig. Every male Stanford student will start today,
armtd witli a trowel, a spade, or a piece of window
fcla;.s. We will start digging in one of the Quad islands,
imd upon reaching 1.000 feet down we will start tun
neling toward the center of the Quad. By a constant
process of expanding both left and right as well as
forwaid, the cavern should—in no time at all—reach
gigantic size.
The dirt from these diggings will, of course, be used
to bury the Hoover Tower, thus protecting it from
anything but a direct atom bomb strike.
'I he female students, being too likely to revert to
type il they start grubbing around, will be used more
or If; s in an artistic sense. They will spend their time
decorating, in pleasant shades of pastel, the sandbags
covering the Quad. Faces could be sketched on them
in lipstick; snow men (or rather sand men) could be
constructed, and with the help of crepe paper even
niivdit make the front of our beloved church a hand
seme sight. 1 think, in regard to the church (which
m.uk think is already beautiful from the outside) that

a Russell House-type of two-headed monster would j
look particularly interesting.
Cnce the lads —and a few aurls—with particularly ,
sharp fingernails—had expanded the bomb-shelter to j
a satisfactory size, the bare-pocketed Administration
would be obligated to add the finishings. They could
take some of the men who are around constantly lous
ing up the roads, and put them to work putting in the
concrete finishing.
Once this is done, the shelter would be furnished
via the donation route by the various living residences
and agencies of the University. The lighting system
in the Library could be donated without sizable loss,
the furnishings from the now submerged Hoover
Tower could be thrown in, and each of the living resi
dences could donate one stick of furniture. After that, i
a mere two-million-dollar donation would probably
lix up the other details.
Plumbing fixtures of course would have to be put
in, but I think it would be all right—and in fine tradi
tion to have the most available sets of plumbing la- j
beled "For Faculty Only." Thus the combined dona
tion of these gentlemen would probably be enough to
take care of this most essential matter.
All in all, it would be a great and magnificent thing
for the University. Parents could send their offspring
to Stanford with utter confidence, that should the
Kremlin decide to destroy all forms of Titoism, that
the Stanford Red is, at least, prepared.
Iri the event that the whole war-scare should blow
over, the bomb shelter would still be very useful. We
could take several of our esteemed professors in the
Econ and Romanic Languages Departments. (You
know, the ones like Mr. M. who wear a big watch
chain with a Phi Pete key on one end and no watch
on the other.) 'I hen we could bury the whole lot in
the bomb .shelter next to the "Faculty Only" sign.
Well, it's a thought. We should get to v/ork on it
right away. Don't just stand there—DlG!

gigantic size.
The dirt from these diggings will, of course, be used
to bury the Hoover Tower, thus protecting it from
anything but a direct atom bomb strike.
'I he female students, being too likely to revert to
type il they start grubbing around, will be used more
or If; s in an artistic sense. They will spend their time
decorating, in pleasant shades of pastel, the sandbags
covering the Quad. Faces could be sketched on them
in lipstick; snow men (or rather sand men) could be
constructed, and with the help of crepe paper even
niivdit make the front of our beloved church a hand
seme sight. 1 think, in regard to the church (which
m.uk think is already beautiful from the outside) that

a Russell House-type of two-headed monster would j
look particularly interesting.
Cnce the lads —and a few aurls—with particularly ,
sharp fingernails—had expanded the bomb-shelter to j
a satisfactory size, the bare-pocketed Administration
would be obligated to add the finishings. They could
take some of the men who are around constantly lous
ing up the roads, and put them to work putting in the
concrete finishing.
Once this is done, the shelter would be furnished
via the donation route by the various living residences
and agencies of the University. The lighting system
in the Library could be donated without sizable loss,
the furnishings from the now submerged Hoover
Tower could be thrown in, and each of the living resi
dences could donate one stick of furniture. After that, i
a mere two-million-dollar donation would probably
lix up the other details.
Plumbing fixtures of course would have to be put
in, but I think it would be all right—and in fine tradi
tion to have the most available sets of plumbing la- j
beled "For Faculty Only." Thus the combined dona
tion of these gentlemen would probably be enough to
take care of this most essential matter.
All in all, it would be a great and magnificent thing
for the University. Parents could send their offspring
to Stanford with utter confidence, that should the
Kremlin decide to destroy all forms of Titoism, that
the Stanford Red is, at least, prepared.
Iri the event that the whole war-scare should blow
over, the bomb shelter would still be very useful. We
could take several of our esteemed professors in the
Econ and Romanic Languages Departments. (You
know, the ones like Mr. M. who wear a big watch
chain with a Phi Pete key on one end and no watch
on the other.) 'I hen we could bury the whole lot in
the bomb .shelter next to the "Faculty Only" sign.

With the pink Chinese-fellas bursting into Korea, I
huve decided, in view of impending disaster, to scrap
n:y aims for Quad improvement—i.e., swimming pools,
gondolas, etc. Instead I will now propose a plan, which
1 am sure will be immediately snatched up by our

founding fathers, which will be
more in keeping with the current
international emergencies.
Underneath the Quad, the ugli
ness of which will be somewhat
concealed by the strategic placing
of several hundred thousand sand-
Lays, we will build the greatest
bomb-proof shelter the world has
known. It will dwarf McCor-

rnick's and make the Carlsbad Caverns look like a
gopher hole.
'J he fir: t step in this project is, as you might suspect,
to dig. Every male Stanford student will start today,
armtd witli a trowel, a spade, or a piece of window
fcla;.s. We will start digging in one of the Quad islands,
imd upon reaching 1.000 feet down we will start tun
neling toward the center of the Quad. By a constant
process of expanding both left and right as well as
forwaid, the cavern should—in no time at all—reach
gigantic size.
