# Bad Taste
## 
### 
To the Editor:
As a graduate student from the University of Cali

fornia, which muny still consider one of the world's
greatest universities despite the loyalty oath, I take
exception to certain remarks of Al Berry, the Daily's
sportswriter. His references to the "rabble at Cal"
are in poor taste and do not have quite the right ring
in keeping wilh the tone of his article.
If the much-lauded Stanford spirit is enhanced by
such an uncalled-for smear of the Cal student body,
one wonders if decency is one of its characteristics.
Fortunately Berry's bad taste seems to be shared by a
minority of the students at Stanford.
