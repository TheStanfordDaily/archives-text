# UN Invites China Reds

### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Nov. Xâ€”
The United States demanded today
that the United Nations Security
Council order Chinese Communist
troops out of Korea. But American
Delegate Warren R. Austin voted
with the majority as the Council in
vited the Peking regime to rush
representatives here to join the de
bate.
It was the first time in the 10-
rnonth - old East - West fight over
Chinese credentials that the United
Statos voted to allow Chinese Com
munists to come here and argue
their case.
In debate, Austin warned that
Chinese intervention in the Korean
war raised "a grave danger" of a
new World War, and told the Coun
cil that the Chinese Communists
should be "summoned" rather than
"invited" to explain intervention
charges made by Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur this week.
