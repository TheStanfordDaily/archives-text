All of the lawyers will argue the
same problem, which concerns a
dispute over "unlawful search and

Bill Widens.
The three judges for the trials
will include one third - year Law
School student, one faculty mem

from the Bay Area.
They will decide which of the
eight contestants will have the
privilege of competing for the $100
first prize and a $50 runner -up

the remaining two finalists.
