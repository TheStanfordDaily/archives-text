# WSC Leads Cards 5-4 In Gridiron Victories
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford, seeking its second Con
ference win, goes against a Wash
ington State team Saturday which
has shown little this year.
In six games the Cougars have
three wins, one loss, and two ties.
However, their wins have been at
the expense of Montana, Oregon,
and Utah State. Stanford and WSC
have both played USC, each gain
ing a tie. From this it looks as
though the two clubs battling Sat
urday are evenly matched, but in
a season such as this, comparative
scores mean nothinc.
As strange a sit may seem, the
Cougar-Indian series is the rough
est Stanford has maintained over
the years. It must be taken into
consideration that the rivalry with
the northern school started only 14
years ago in lD.'tfi. Therefore Stan

ford opened the series with WSC
when the school was well estab
lished and well matured in the
world of athletics. Washington State
is the only Conference school, with
the exception of USC, which has
won a majority of the games played
against Stanford.
One-Game Edge
That majority is only one scant
game. In the nine years played to
date, the Cougars have copped five.
The last time the schools met in
gridiron warfare was in 1948, when
Stanford traveled to Pullman. Get
ting oti' to a poor start on a slow
turf, the Indians gave up 14 quick
points. A Card rally in the fourth
period picked up one touchdown
which was not enough. Final score:
Stanford 7, WSC 14.
Stanford Stadium was the site of
the 1946 battle. It was a see-saw
thriller with Stanford the eventual
winner, 27-26. Going into the last
quarter, the Indians led 21 to 20. A
Cougar TD gave them a 26 to 21
lead and it wasn't until Ainslie Bell
threw to Bob Anderson for the final
goal crossing with two minutes to
go that Stanford insured victory.
Washington State has edged the
Cards 14 to 13 in two meetings.
The first game of the series was
played at Pullman in 1936. The
' Cougars got off to a fast 14-point
I lead, but the visiting Injuns scored
! twice and had one TD called back
:in the last 20 minutes. However, it
j was not enough and the score ended
J 14 to 13.
'41 Cougar Upset
In 1941, paced by a pair of the
finest ends ever turned out in foot
ball circles, Nick Suseoff and Dale
Gentry, the Cougars upset a Card
team fresh from the Rose Bowl. The
end play, which forced Frankie Al
bert to pass hurriedly, pinched end
runs, and blocked kicks, was the
difference in the WSC 14 to 13 tri
umph.
In 1937 and 1938, Stanford scored
two shut-out wins, 23 to 0 and S
to 0 respectively. Pete Faye, Card
halfback, sparked both victories
with long breakaway runs. The 23
to 0 game marked the highest dif
ference in score during the series.
A poor, colorless Card team went
doyn to defeat in 1939, 7 to 0. Next
year saw Albert and Co. roll up a
26 to 24 win after trailing 7 to 0.
In the nine-game series Stanford
has amassed 117 points, WSC 95.

has shown little this year.
In six games the Cougars have
three wins, one loss, and two ties.
However, their wins have been at
the expense of Montana, Oregon,
and Utah State. Stanford and WSC
have both played USC, each gain
ing a tie. From this it looks as
though the two clubs battling Sat
urday are evenly matched, but in
a season such as this, comparative
scores mean nothinc.
As strange a sit may seem, the
Cougar-Indian series is the rough
est Stanford has maintained over
the years. It must be taken into
consideration that the rivalry with
the northern school started only 14
years ago in lD.'tfi. Therefore Stan

ford opened the series with WSC
when the school was well estab
lished and well matured in the
world of athletics. Washington State
is the only Conference school, with
the exception of USC, which has
won a majority of the games played
against Stanford.
One-Game Edge
That majority is only one scant
game. In the nine years played to
date, the Cougars have copped five.
The last time the schools met in
gridiron warfare was in 1948, when
Stanford traveled to Pullman. Get
ting oti' to a poor start on a slow
turf, the Indians gave up 14 quick
points. A Card rally in the fourth
period picked up one touchdown
which was not enough. Final score:
Stanford 7, WSC 14.
Stanford Stadium was the site of
the 1946 battle. It was a see-saw
thriller with Stanford the eventual
winner, 27-26. Going into the last
quarter, the Indians led 21 to 20. A
Cougar TD gave them a 26 to 21
lead and it wasn't until Ainslie Bell
threw to Bob Anderson for the final
goal crossing with two minutes to
go that Stanford insured victory.
Washington State has edged the
Cards 14 to 13 in two meetings.
The first game of the series was
played at Pullman in 1936. The
' Cougars got off to a fast 14-point
I lead, but the visiting Injuns scored
! twice and had one TD called back
:in the last 20 minutes. However, it
j was not enough and the score ended
J 14 to 13.
'41 Cougar Upset
In 1941, paced by a pair of the
finest ends ever turned out in foot
ball circles, Nick Suseoff and Dale
Gentry, the Cougars upset a Card
team fresh from the Rose Bowl. The
end play, which forced Frankie Al
bert to pass hurriedly, pinched end
runs, and blocked kicks, was the
difference in the WSC 14 to 13 tri
umph.
In 1937 and 1938, Stanford scored
two shut-out wins, 23 to 0 and S
to 0 respectively. Pete Faye, Card
halfback, sparked both victories
with long breakaway runs. The 23
to 0 game marked the highest dif
ference in score during the series.
A poor, colorless Card team went
doyn to defeat in 1939, 7 to 0. Next
year saw Albert and Co. roll up a
26 to 24 win after trailing 7 to 0.
In the nine-game series Stanford
has amassed 117 points, WSC 95.
Stanford, seeking its second Con
ference win, goes against a Wash
