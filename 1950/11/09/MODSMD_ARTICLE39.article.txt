# Gridders Up For Cougars
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity footballers ran
1 through a spirited scrimmage yes
| terday in preparation for this Sat
â€¢ urday's tussle with Washington
I State.
It was obvious that the gridders
weren't looking forward to Army or
Cal this week; it is WSC they want
to beat. ,
The scrum was highlighted by the
jarring runs of Bobby White and
Boyd Benson and the sharp long
| passes from Gary Kerkorian to Bill
McColl and Bruce Van Alstyne.
The most spectacular run of the day

i was turned in by reserve back Billy
! Heilbron, who spun and weaved his
way through the whole defensive
; team.
The injury situation was also
looking up. Co - captain Gordy
White was scrimmaging for the first
time in weeks, and will be a definite
i participant in Saturday's game. Half
Eric Southwood, shelved for several
\ weeks, was running without pads
and showed no signs of a groin in
! jury that has been plaguing him
lately.
Only Ron Eadie, the lame end,
j appeared to be a doubtful player in
I the Cougar contest.


TOMMY SHAW, senior quarter
back, may start Saturday's game
with Washington State's Cougars.
