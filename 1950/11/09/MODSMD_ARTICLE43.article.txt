rounded off five weeks of intensive
practice with a pair of intra-squad
games last week

ett Dean devoted much of the time
to rebuilding for the coming sea

Clegg Shifted
With the shift of last year's first
sacker, Dick Clegg, to the outfield,
hard-hitting Jim Walsh, up from
last season's junior varsity, and

Harbor JC transfer Harold Hen
nacy have been sharing duties
around the initial sack.
While Tom Shaw, second base
man last season, is devoting his ef
forts to the gridiron wars, veteran
Art Abrahamson has taken over the
keystone chores.
Last year's outstanding third
baseman, Bruce Cameron, has
moved into the vacancy at short
stop caused by the graduation of
Melton. Bruce Iversen, up from the
junior varsity, and sophomore Dick
Cole have both been working out
at third base.
Outfield Suffers
Clegg was shifted to the outfield
to add hitting power in the outer
gardens, which have suffered the
severest losses. Co-captain Charlie
Cole, Bud Klein, John Claypool, and
Bob Larson were all lost, when they
received their sheepskins last June.

In addition, regular outfielder Jim
Trabucco is a large question mark,
Trabuceo, in his first year of Law
School, very possibly may not be
able to find time to devote to base- !
ball.
Catcher Jack Shepard, who led ;
the frosh in bitting lagt spring, has |
also been moved to the outfield. |
Harry Hugasian, Hal Skillman, and
Dave Rosenkrantz head the list of

I four baseball monograms in mod- i
j ern times, were all lost to the

j was out most of last season with a
sore arm, has ransferred to the
University of Kansas.
Leading the list of returning
hurlers is Joe Chez, voted the most
valuable player award by last year's

squad. Chez was instrumental in j
the Cards' successful fight for the J
CIBA crown last year, as he |
chalked up a nine-won and one- I
I lost record for his sophomore year. ]
Jim Claypool, Roger Osenbaugh,
■ Jack Alexander, Lloyd Westphal,
j and converted outfielder Tuny Stel
| lar also return for another year of
