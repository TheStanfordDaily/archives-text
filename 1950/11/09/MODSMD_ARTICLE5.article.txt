### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
State Dean Acheson said today he
will not resign becausc of the elec
tion results, which Republicans
called a protest against his Far
Eastern policies and alleged cod
dling of Communists at home.
Acheson was a main GOP target
in the campaign. Republican can
didates rode to victory in Maryland.
Illinois, California, and other key
states partly on the basis of charges
by Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R.,
Wis., that Acheson failed to clear
Communists out of the State De
partment.
