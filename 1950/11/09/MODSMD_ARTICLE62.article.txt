# Bailey Finishes Messenger Talks
## 
### 
Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
history, has recently returned from
Cornell University where he deliv
ered six lecturcs on the Messenger
Foundation. The lectures were con
cerned with historical and current
aspects of Russian-American rela
tions, and will be published in the
spring by the Cornell University
I Press.
The Messenger Series was inaug
urated in 1923 as a consequence of
! a gift of Hiram J. Messenger, who
I stipulated that a course of lecturcs
be given annually at Cornell for the
i purpose "of raising the standard of
I our political and social life."
