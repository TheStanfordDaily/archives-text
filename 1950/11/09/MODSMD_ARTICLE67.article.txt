# Polo Squad Faces Crucial Test Against New Mexico
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity polo team clashes with New Mexico Military
Institute from Roswell this weekend. The campus polo field bor
dering on El Camino Real east of the football stadium will thunder
to the beat of horses' hooves at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow as the Redskin
quartet opens its first intercollegiate match of the autumn quarter.

Friday's tilt is a crucial one for
Captain Scherer's squad because
the fate of a trophy hangs in the
balance. The trophy, donated joint
ly by the two squads, will become a
permanent possession of NMMI if
that team wins Friday's game, by
virtue of an agreement stipulating
that the first team to win three
consecutive games would retain it.

l their match last fall but New Mex
j ico won each of two games last
i spring by a one-goal margin. The
| first game was won only in an over
j time chukker.
