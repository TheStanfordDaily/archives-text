## Nation's Phone Workers Strike 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. » (UP)—More
than 8,000 telephone workers left
their jobs today in strikes which
disrupted the nation's communica
tions system, and day-long attempts
to restore normal service ended in
failure.
The government was watching
the situation closely, but there were
no plans at present for seizure of
the sprawling system.
Hope for an end to the strike
lies in collective bargaining, Wash
ington officials said. Shortly after
federal mediators in New York
broke off their efforts to end the
strike, mediators scheduled new
meetings tomorrow morning.
However, a spokesman for the
Communications Workers of Amer
ica (CIO) said that in some parts
of the country members were being
ordered back to work because the
number of strikers available there
was inadequate to picket telephone
exchanges effectively.
