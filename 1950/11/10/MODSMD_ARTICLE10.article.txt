# 'Li'l Injun' Will Perform Tomorrow at WSC Game
## 
### 
"Li'l Injun," Stanford's nameless mascot, will lie out in front of the
stands at the Washington State game tomorrow, sporting a new head
and costume.
His absence at (lie lasl two games, which was considered as a definite
jinx by many, was necessary because of certain repairs that had lo be
mrdc.
The top of "Li'l Injun's" suit, which Chris Karr bad made for him,
was stolen at the UCLA game, and another one bad to be sewn. Then,
"Chips" Ward painted a new paper-mache head as the old one was ten
heavy and did not have enough ventilation.
But the sprightly little fellow, despite his recent misfortunes, will be
•nit in full dress tomorrow to skin the Washington Cougar.
