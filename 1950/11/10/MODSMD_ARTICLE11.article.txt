### 
A year and a half of petty thefts and
other crimes on ihe campus may end

Alto juveniles.
The youths were picked up
Wednesday, one by Stanford Police
and one by the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office. Both hoys are now
in the custody of the sheriff's office.
They confessed to a number of
thefts going back to 1948. Among the
things they have admitted stealing
are car covers, radios, auto robes,
tires, wheels, field glasses, gloves, and
sweaters.
They also admitted knocking two
girls down near Roble Hall a year ago
and snatching their purses. Also a
year ago, they confessed to the steal
ing of a new motor scooter, which
they took to the dump, dismantled
and scattered around the area.
Police Chief Gordy Davis said the
youths couldn't remember all the
things they had stolen nor what had
become of many of the articles.
The crimes seem to have no pat
tern, Davis said, and the two boys
appear to have stolen "just to be
doing something."
The youths will come before juve
nile court for a hearing sometime
