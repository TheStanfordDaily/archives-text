# Win-Starved Cards Ready For Cougars
## Schwartz Announces 'Surprise' Back field Of Shaw, Bryan, Benson, and Meyers 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's victory-malnutritioned gridders will be scratching for their first victory in four games
when they lock horns with a Washington State outfit that has only lost one game this season at
2 p.m. tomorrow in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
The Indians, this past week in practice, have acted like a fierce, underfed lion. They've missed
their meal the past few Saturdays, and are anxious for a feast tomorrow. The spirit was so high in

Wednesday's scrimmage that
backlield coach Pete Kmetovic
was prompted to say, "It was
one of the best workouts of the
year."
The Indians are anxious to erase
from memory the outcome of the
last three tussles. Granted, they
deserved to lose the Washington af
fair, but they feel that they de
served a better shake in the UCLA
and USC games. Scratch off the
latter; had the zebra-shirted men
been on their toes, it would have
been Stanford 21 to 7.
Surprise Barkfield
Sideline observers feel that Stan
ford is due to explode tomorrow. If
they are going to, it had better be
tomorrow, because nobody yet has
exploded against the likes of Army
and Cal, the Indians' next two play
mates.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has
tentatively announced several
surprise changes in the starting
barkfield. Only one member of
last week's starting quartet will
face the opening kickoff tomor
row, fullback Bob Mevers who
led last week's ground gainers
with a 5.3 average.
Tom Shaw, the come-through
man, will probably get the open
ing call at quarterback. Bobby
Bryan, he of the winded heels,
will open at left half, and Boyd
Benson will start at right half.
Benson, the Army - bound half
back who received a six-month
student deferment, earned his
first-string job by virtue of his
performance against IJSC and in
practice. Thanks, Uncle Sam.
Bobby White and Harry Huga
sian will probably start at defen
sive halfbacks. Later Joe St. Gcme
and Bill Storum will fill in for them,
so they can see offensive duty.
White Is Back
The brightest note of this week's
practice has been the return to ac
tion of tackle Gordy White. The
big co-captain has finally shaken
off an ankle injury, and will be used
tnainly on defense.
Marv Tennefoss, Jack Rye, and
Bruce Van Alstyne, recuperating
ends, should be nearer peak effi
ciency this week than they were
last. Halfback Dick Broome and
