# Win-Starved Cards Ready For Cougars
## Schwartz Announces 'Surprise' Back field Of Shaw, Bryan, Benson, and Meyers 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's victory-malnutritioned gridders will be scratching for their first victory in four games
when they lock horns with a Washington State outfit that has only lost one game this season at
2 p.m. tomorrow in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
The Indians, this past week in practice, have acted like a fierce, underfed lion. They've missed
their meal the past few Saturdays, and are anxious for a feast tomorrow. The spirit was so high in

Wednesday's scrimmage that
backlield coach Pete Kmetovic
was prompted to say, "It was
one of the best workouts of the
year."
The Indians are anxious to erase
from memory the outcome of the
last three tussles. Granted, they
deserved to lose the Washington af
fair, but they feel that they de
served a better shake in the UCLA
and USC games. Scratch off the
latter; had the zebra-shirted men
been on their toes, it would have
been Stanford 21 to 7.
Surprise Barkfield
Sideline observers feel that Stan
ford is due to explode tomorrow. If
they are going to, it had better be
tomorrow, because nobody yet has
exploded against the likes of Army
and Cal, the Indians' next two play
mates.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has
tentatively announced several
surprise changes in the starting
barkfield. Only one member of
last week's starting quartet will
face the opening kickoff tomor
row, fullback Bob Mevers who
led last week's ground gainers
with a 5.3 average.
Tom Shaw, the come-through
man, will probably get the open
ing call at quarterback. Bobby
Bryan, he of the winded heels,
will open at left half, and Boyd
Benson will start at right half.
Benson, the Army - bound half
back who received a six-month
student deferment, earned his
first-string job by virtue of his
performance against IJSC and in
practice. Thanks, Uncle Sam.
Bobby White and Harry Huga
sian will probably start at defen
sive halfbacks. Later Joe St. Gcme
and Bill Storum will fill in for them,
so they can see offensive duty.
White Is Back
The brightest note of this week's
practice has been the return to ac
tion of tackle Gordy White. The
big co-captain has finally shaken
off an ankle injury, and will be used
tnainly on defense.
Marv Tennefoss, Jack Rye, and
Bruce Van Alstyne, recuperating
ends, should be nearer peak effi
ciency this week than they were
last. Halfback Dick Broome and
end Ron Eadie appear to be tin
only doubtful participants.
Wednesday's scrum was spec
tacular in so far as Ihe passing
was concerned. Bill McColl, who
is close to a PCC pass-catching
record, and Bruce Van Alstyne
were Ihe main targets of hull's

, eye long passes from Shaw and
Gary Kerkorian.
Kmetovic hinted, however, that
the Cougars may see a lot of run
ning this Saturday. The Injuns,
in an effort to improve their in
[ consistent ground game, will give
the halfbacks and fullbacks a
chance to strut their stuff. Be
sides those already mentioned,
Bob Griffin, Skip Crist, Wes
Laubscher, and Billy Ileilhron
will probably see offensive back
field duty. Ileilhron, the Hawai
ian scooter, was dazzling in prac
tice this week and is rated a defi
i nite "comer." Erie Southwood,
the fancy stepping half, is ready
to go now after being out wilh
injuries most of the season. That
will mean a lot to the Cards.
Cougars No Pushovers
Although the Farm fellows are
rated two-touchdown favorites, the
Cougars from Pullman way aren't
any pushovers. The fact that the
1 Stanfords realize this was summed
| up by Lino Coach Dutch Fehring.
When asked whether the recuper
ating Gordy White could be saved
for the Army game, Fehring an
swered, "Not on your life. The game
against Washington State won't be
easy, and we'll need Gordy."
WSC, surprisingly enough, has
lost only one game this year, that
to UCLA (42 to 0) in the opener.
After that, the Cougars recovered
and bowled over Utah State, Mon
tana, and Oregon. Although every
body and his brother .Zeke are
beating those teams, WSC,tied USC,

20 to 20. A Stanfordite doesn't have
to think very far back to realize
that the Cards also tied the Trojans.
Coach Forrest Evashevski, the
former blocking back for Tommy
Harmon at Michigan, has installed
a "T" with the Michigan buck
laterals. The Cougar style of play
features power on the ground, an
aerial attack, and plenty of de
ception. Spinners, handofTs, and
passing in Evashevski's system
should provide plenty of spectator
interest.
The Cougars adhere to the two
platoon system and aren't short of
men, as they have offensive men
who play strictly offense and defen
sive men who play strictly defense.
No GO-minute men.
Captain LaVern Torgeson will
lead the line from his center post,
while quarterback Bob Gambold
will mastermind the offense from
his quarterback position. Gambold
and Torgeson are the only two sen
iors on the starting lineup. Gambold
has completed nearly half his passes
and is wicked on the short ones.
Washington State's running game
will be aptly taken care of by right
half Byron Bailey, the workhorse of
the team, and fullbacks Ray Hobbs
and Dick Bower. Scout reports
show that these three men are to
be feared.

Tom Shaw, the come-through

Bryan, he of the winded heels,
will open at left half, and Boyd
Benson will start at right half.
Benson, the Army - bound half
back who received a six-month
student deferment, earned his
first-string job by virtue of his
performance against IJSC and in
practice. Thanks, Uncle Sam.
Bobby White and Harry Huga
sian will probably start at defen
sive halfbacks. Later Joe St. Gcme
and Bill Storum will fill in for them,
so they can see offensive duty.
White Is Back
The brightest note of this week's
practice has been the return to ac
tion of tackle Gordy White. The
big co-captain has finally shaken
off an ankle injury, and will be used
tnainly on defense.
Marv Tennefoss, Jack Rye, and
Bruce Van Alstyne, recuperating
ends, should be nearer peak effi
ciency this week than they were
last. Halfback Dick Broome and
end Ron Eadie appear to be tin
only doubtful participants.
Wednesday's scrum was spec
tacular in so far as Ihe passing
was concerned. Bill McColl, who
is close to a PCC pass-catching
record, and Bruce Van Alstyne
were Ihe main targets of hull's

, eye long passes from Shaw and
Gary Kerkorian.
Kmetovic hinted, however, that
the Cougars may see a lot of run
ning this Saturday. The Injuns,
in an effort to improve their in
[ consistent ground game, will give
the halfbacks and fullbacks a
chance to strut their stuff. Be
sides those already mentioned,
Bob Griffin, Skip Crist, Wes
Laubscher, and Billy Ileilhron
will probably see offensive back
field duty. Ileilhron, the Hawai
ian scooter, was dazzling in prac
tice this week and is rated a defi
i nite "comer." Erie Southwood,
the fancy stepping half, is ready
to go now after being out wilh
injuries most of the season. That
will mean a lot to the Cards.
Cougars No Pushovers
Although the Farm fellows are
rated two-touchdown favorites, the
Cougars from Pullman way aren't
any pushovers. The fact that the
1 Stanfords realize this was summed
| up by Lino Coach Dutch Fehring.
When asked whether the recuper
ating Gordy White could be saved
for the Army game, Fehring an
swered, "Not on your life. The game
against Washington State won't be
easy, and we'll need Gordy."
WSC, surprisingly enough, has
lost only one game this year, that
to UCLA (42 to 0) in the opener.
After that, the Cougars recovered
and bowled over Utah State, Mon
tana, and Oregon. Although every
body and his brother .Zeke are
beating those teams, WSC,tied USC,

20 to 20. A Stanfordite doesn't have
to think very far back to realize
that the Cards also tied the Trojans.
Coach Forrest Evashevski, the
former blocking back for Tommy
Harmon at Michigan, has installed
a "T" with the Michigan buck
laterals. The Cougar style of play
features power on the ground, an
aerial attack, and plenty of de
ception. Spinners, handofTs, and
passing in Evashevski's system
should provide plenty of spectator
interest.
The Cougars adhere to the two
platoon system and aren't short of
men, as they have offensive men
who play strictly offense and defen
sive men who play strictly defense.
No GO-minute men.
Captain LaVern Torgeson will
lead the line from his center post,
while quarterback Bob Gambold
will mastermind the offense from
his quarterback position. Gambold
and Torgeson are the only two sen
iors on the starting lineup. Gambold
has completed nearly half his passes
and is wicked on the short ones.
Washington State's running game
will be aptly taken care of by right
half Byron Bailey, the workhorse of

Stanford's victory-malnutritioned gridders will be scratching for their first victory in four games
when they lock horns with a Washington State outfit that has only lost one game this season at
2 p.m. tomorrow in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
The Indians, this past week in practice, have acted like a fierce, underfed lion. They've missed
their meal the past few Saturdays, and are anxious for a feast tomorrow. The spirit was so high in

Wednesday's scrimmage that
backlield coach Pete Kmetovic

Kmetovic hinted, however, that
the Cougars may see a lot of run
ning this Saturday. The Injuns,
in an effort to improve their in
[ consistent ground game, will give
the halfbacks and fullbacks a
chance to strut their stuff. Be
sides those already mentioned,
Bob Griffin, Skip Crist, Wes
Laubscher, and Billy Ileilhron
will probably see offensive back
field duty. Ileilhron, the Hawai
ian scooter, was dazzling in prac
tice this week and is rated a defi
i nite "comer." Erie Southwood,
the fancy stepping half, is ready
to go now after being out wilh
injuries most of the season. That
will mean a lot to the Cards.
Cougars No Pushovers
Although the Farm fellows are
rated two-touchdown favorites, the
Cougars from Pullman way aren't
any pushovers. The fact that the
1 Stanfords realize this was summed
| up by Lino Coach Dutch Fehring.
When asked whether the recuper
ating Gordy White could be saved
for the Army game, Fehring an
swered, "Not on your life. The game
against Washington State won't be
easy, and we'll need Gordy."
WSC, surprisingly enough, has
lost only one game this year, that
to UCLA (42 to 0) in the opener.
After that, the Cougars recovered
and bowled over Utah State, Mon
tana, and Oregon. Although every
body and his brother .Zeke are
beating those teams, WSC,tied USC,

20 to 20. A Stanfordite doesn't have
to think very far back to realize
that the Cards also tied the Trojans.
Coach Forrest Evashevski, the
former blocking back for Tommy
Harmon at Michigan, has installed
a "T" with the Michigan buck
laterals. The Cougar style of play
features power on the ground, an
aerial attack, and plenty of de
ception. Spinners, handofTs, and
passing in Evashevski's system
should provide plenty of spectator
interest.
The Cougars adhere to the two
platoon system and aren't short of
men, as they have offensive men
who play strictly offense and defen
sive men who play strictly defense.
No GO-minute men.
Captain LaVern Torgeson will
lead the line from his center post,
while quarterback Bob Gambold
will mastermind the offense from
his quarterback position. Gambold
and Torgeson are the only two sen
iors on the starting lineup. Gambold
has completed nearly half his passes
and is wicked on the short ones.
Washington State's running game
will be aptly taken care of by right
half Byron Bailey, the workhorse of
the team, and fullbacks Ray Hobbs
and Dick Bower. Scout reports
show that these three men are to
be feared.
Following are the starting offen
sive lineups:

Stanford's victory-malnutritioned gridders will be scratching for their first victory in four games
when they lock horns with a Washington State outfit that has only lost one game this season at
2 p.m. tomorrow in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.
The Indians, this past week in practice, have acted like a fierce, underfed lion. They've missed
their meal the past few Saturdays, and are anxious for a feast tomorrow. The spirit was so high in

Wednesday's scrimmage that
backlield coach Pete Kmetovic
was prompted to say, "It was
one of the best workouts of the
year."
The Indians are anxious to erase
from memory the outcome of the
last three tussles. Granted, they
deserved to lose the Washington af
fair, but they feel that they de
served a better shake in the UCLA
and USC games. Scratch off the
latter; had the zebra-shirted men
been on their toes, it would have
been Stanford 21 to 7.
Surprise Barkfield
Sideline observers feel that Stan
ford is due to explode tomorrow. If
they are going to, it had better be
tomorrow, because nobody yet has
exploded against the likes of Army
and Cal, the Indians' next two play
mates.
Coach Marchie Schwartz has
tentatively announced several
surprise changes in the starting
barkfield. Only one member of
last week's starting quartet will
face the opening kickoff tomor
row, fullback Bob Mevers who
led last week's ground gainers
with a 5.3 average.
Tom Shaw, the come-through
man, will probably get the open
ing call at quarterback. Bobby
Bryan, he of the winded heels,
will open at left half, and Boyd
Benson will start at right half.
Benson, the Army - bound half
back who received a six-month
student deferment, earned his
first-string job by virtue of his
performance against IJSC and in
practice. Thanks, Uncle Sam.
Bobby White and Harry Huga
sian will probably start at defen
sive halfbacks. Later Joe St. Gcme
and Bill Storum will fill in for them,
so they can see offensive duty.
White Is Back
The brightest note of this week's
practice has been the return to ac
tion of tackle Gordy White. The
big co-captain has finally shaken
off an ankle injury, and will be used
tnainly on defense.
Marv Tennefoss, Jack Rye, and
Bruce Van Alstyne, recuperating
ends, should be nearer peak effi
ciency this week than they were
last. Halfback Dick Broome and
Stanford's victory-malnutritioned gridders will be scratching for their first victory in four games
when they lock horns with a Washington State outfit that has only lost one game this season at
2 p.m. tomorrow in Stanford's Big Brown Bowl.

only doubtful participants.
Wednesday's scrum was spec
tacular in so far as Ihe passing
was concerned. Bill McColl, who
is close to a PCC pass-catching
record, and Bruce Van Alstyne
were Ihe main targets of hull's

, eye long passes from Shaw and
Gary Kerkorian.
Kmetovic hinted, however, that
the Cougars may see a lot of run
ning this Saturday. The Injuns,
in an effort to improve their in
[ consistent ground game, will give
the halfbacks and fullbacks a
chance to strut their stuff. Be
sides those already mentioned,
Bob Griffin, Skip Crist, Wes
Laubscher, and Billy Ileilhron
will probably see offensive back
field duty. Ileilhron, the Hawai
ian scooter, was dazzling in prac
tice this week and is rated a defi
i nite "comer." Erie Southwood,
the fancy stepping half, is ready
to go now after being out wilh
injuries most of the season. That
will mean a lot to the Cards.
Cougars No Pushovers
Although the Farm fellows are
rated two-touchdown favorites, the
Cougars from Pullman way aren't
any pushovers. The fact that the

When asked whether the recuper

20 to 20. A Stanfordite doesn't have
to think very far back to realize
that the Cards also tied the Trojans.
Coach Forrest Evashevski, the
former blocking back for Tommy
Harmon at Michigan, has installed
a "T" with the Michigan buck
laterals. The Cougar style of play
features power on the ground, an
aerial attack, and plenty of de
ception. Spinners, handofTs, and

should provide plenty of spectator
