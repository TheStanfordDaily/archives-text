# Julius Caesar Proves Top Crowd Pleaser
## 
### MAGGIE BERNT 
The blaze of a Roman fanfare !
heralded in "Julius Caesar," the
first major production of the
year for the Stanford Players, !
which opened a three-night run
in Memorial Auditorium last
night.
Featuring everything from spark- !
flashing sword fights to a chase se- [
quence the Lone Ranger would be
proud of, the .100-year-old classic
kept the audience on edge with the
unfortunate exception of a balcony
full of giggly high school students
who should have stayed at home.
Well-paced performances of Don
Campbell, whose portrayal of Bru
tus gained momentum in every
scene, and John Brehner whose
Caesar was played with rare un
derstanding, the large cast pre
sented a nrar-perfect first night
production, speaking their lines
with a near-miraculous projection
that for the most part reached the
last row of the balcony.
Edward Linck as Antony and Mau
rice Argent and Don Russell as the
scheming cohorts of Brutus headed
the supporting cast with full and
honest acting demanded throughout
by Director A. Nicholas Vardac.
The effc?t of the production was
accentuated to the last degree by the
lighting of O. G. Brockett and the
set design of Wendell Cole. Cole
utilized a large unit set on which all
scenes were player, giving the action
continuity from start to finish.
The lighting effects, which
transformed the settings time and
time again as well as pacing the
| moods of the scenes, used shad
ows and darkness and at times
brilliant red, to climax the action.
The one feature of last night's
production that spoiled its effect
was the behavior of a large group
of high school students in the bal
cony. Arriving at the play in school
buses, obviously for the purpose of
learning something from the per
formance, the students did nothing
but spoil the evening for the rest
of the audience.
