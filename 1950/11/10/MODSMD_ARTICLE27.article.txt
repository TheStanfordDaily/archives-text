Thfc Daily has received many requests for an
explanation of the reasoning behind the Stan
ford Athletic Board's decision in offering Coach
Marchie Schwartz a new five-year contract.
Although there are many personal ideas,
theories, and arguments which certainly en
tered! into the over-all decision, the following
reasops, in general, form the basis of the
board's decision:
1. Marchie is a good football coach, and he
will dlo a good job with the material which is
available.
2. He is a fine representative for the Univer
sity both as a public relations man and as a
gentleman in his profession.
3. He is the type of man the University wants
to direct Stanford students and athletes.
4. future of Stanford football is just as
safe in Coach Schwartz's hands as in the hands
of any other coach given the handicaps of high
tuition, high scholarship requirements, and rig
orous entrance requirements.
5. Stanford football teams under Schwartz

are expected to win their share of games and
appear in the winner's circle every five or six
years.
G. Before firing any faculty member, em
ployee, or administrator, there should be no
doubt but that he is unfit for the job.
7. A five-year contract is necessary because
a coach must have the security of knowing he
will have time to install a top football program.
It would be difficult to get coaches in the future
if they felt Stanford lacked enough faith to hire
them for at least a five-year period.
Aside from small factors, the vote of the rep
resentatives, and irrelevant material these are
the facts which are not "off the record" as an
alyzed by us in our contacts with the Board's
action.
We consider the matter closed as far as stu
dent expression through letters to the editor,
because further discussion would only result
in low morale among team members, students,
and all concerned with Stanford.
