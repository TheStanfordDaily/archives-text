# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
The time has come for Stanford gents
To tell their dates this much . . .
That Big Game Night is two weeks hence,
And Eig Game Night is dutch!

And wise up, men, if you're
thinkin' |
That Roble girls won't share the
drinkin'
They'll ask for doubles, I swear |
they will,
So why not make them share <
the bill?

So wear a smile, my Stanford beauty,
When he asks you for the dough;
And pleasantly perform your duty,'
Or, by God, you won't go!
Okay, men, synchronize your watches . . . it's D-
Night minus 15. 11' you haven't collected from your
date by the end of this week you've had it. And just
in case any of you are in doubt about the proper way
to approach the subject (you gotta be careful . . . last
year when I asked her she put her hand in my eye
instead of in her wallet) . . . here are a few tips from
your ole dad.
Approach No. I.—(Pathetic)
"You know, honey, things are pretty tight this year
.. . I mean with mom's having that operation, and
dad drinking again . . . well, I don't really mind going
without meals twice a week so we can go out Big Game
Night, but it sure would help if . . . what I mean is,
my mother needs medicine and ... if you could
. . . (she can . . . she did . . . she got herself another
date).

Approach No. 2.—(Hinting)
"Say, baby, did you read that column of Palmieri's
this morning? Hysterical, wasn't it? Heh, heh! He
sure can write poetry, too, can't he? Heh, heh! What
did you think about it . . . heh, heh . . . ?" (Be ready
to duck on this one.)
Approach No. 3.—(Poly Sci major)
"Dear, in light of the events of Nov. 25 our present
status quo is becoming untenable. Our relationship
has been promulgated on the basis of a Lilateral en
joyment with a purely unilateral financial responsi
bility. Therefore, 1 propose a modus vivendi accord
ing to the terms of the Palmieri Doctrine." (Shove
off, creep, or she'll kick your in your causus belli.)
Approach No. 4.—(A Note)
$ Dear PenelopeS
Where have you beenS You are never home when
I calls I just wanted to remind you of Big Game Nights
Big Game Night will be funs It will also be expensive?
Our social chairman wants me to hear from you soons
Passionatelys
HOMER
(This isn't worth much if you don't enclose a self
addressed, stamped envelope.)
Approach No. s.—(Aggressive)
"Look, sister, I don't wanta have to ask you again
. . . are you going to give me the dough or do I have
to smash you in the teeth? (This is used only by law
students.)
Approach No. G.—(Rational)
Well, honestly, darling, I really can't understand
your putting up an argument. After all it stands to
reason if some girl is actually going to pay half to go
cut with a creature like this Palmieri, you should be
willing to pay the whole thing to go out with me.
(Obviously a boor.)

"Say, baby, did you read that column of Palmieri's
this morning? Hysterical, wasn't it? Heh, heh! He
sure can write poetry, too, can't he? Heh, heh! What
did you think about it . . . heh, heh . . . ?" (Be ready
to duck on this one.)
Approach No. 3.—(Poly Sci major)
"Dear, in light of the events of Nov. 25 our present
status quo is becoming untenable. Our relationship
has been promulgated on the basis of a Lilateral en
joyment with a purely unilateral financial responsi
bility. Therefore, 1 propose a modus vivendi accord
ing to the terms of the Palmieri Doctrine." (Shove
off, creep, or she'll kick your in your causus belli.)
Approach No. 4.—(A Note)
$ Dear PenelopeS
Where have you beenS You are never home when
I calls I just wanted to remind you of Big Game Nights
Big Game Night will be funs It will also be expensive?
Our social chairman wants me to hear from you soons
Passionatelys
HOMER
(This isn't worth much if you don't enclose a self
addressed, stamped envelope.)
Approach No. s.—(Aggressive)
"Look, sister, I don't wanta have to ask you again
. . . are you going to give me the dough or do I have
to smash you in the teeth? (This is used only by law
students.)
Approach No. G.—(Rational)
Well, honestly, darling, I really can't understand
your putting up an argument. After all it stands to
reason if some girl is actually going to pay half to go
cut with a creature like this Palmieri, you should be
willing to pay the whole thing to go out with me.
(Obviously a boor.)

The time has come for Stanford gents
To tell their dates this much . . .
That Big Game Night is two weeks hence,
And Eig Game Night is dutch!

And wise up, men, if you're
thinkin' |
That Roble girls won't share the
drinkin'
They'll ask for doubles, I swear |
they will,
So why not make them share <
the bill?

So wear a smile, my Stanford beauty,
When he asks you for the dough;
And pleasantly perform your duty,'
Or, by God, you won't go!
Okay, men, synchronize your watches . . . it's D-
Night minus 15. 11' you haven't collected from your
date by the end of this week you've had it. And just
in case any of you are in doubt about the proper way
to approach the subject (you gotta be careful . . . last
year when I asked her she put her hand in my eye
instead of in her wallet) . . . here are a few tips from
your ole dad.
Approach No. I.—(Pathetic)
"You know, honey, things are pretty tight this year
.. . I mean with mom's having that operation, and
dad drinking again . . . well, I don't really mind going
without meals twice a week so we can go out Big Game
Night, but it sure would help if . . . what I mean is,
my mother needs medicine and ... if you could
. . . (she can . . . she did . . . she got herself another
date).

Approach No. 2.—(Hinting)
