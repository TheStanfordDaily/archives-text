## Excom Explains Its Position 
### 
To the Editor:
We wis!i to clarify the Executive Committee's stand
on the referendum petitions oi' Nov. 1 and Nov. b.
Excom voted down these two petitions for the follow
ing reasons: .
1. These petitions are not within the scope of the
authority ol the Associated Students, because as .stated
in the ASSU Constitution, Article VIII. Section 2, ref
erendums must be a "proposition for action or legis
lation. ' These referendums did not call for any action
or legislation.
2. A majority vote is applicable only to matters of
action, but when used in conjunction with matters of
OPINION it allows for no expression of the minority,
i<nd misrepresents its viewpoint.
3. The Law School has upheld our decisions on these
itsues.
4. Excom agrees that this is a matter of student in
t"iest, but that it is not a matter for ASSOCIATED
STUDENT action. With this in mind Excom estab
lished a committee to encourage discussion and fur
ther understanding of the loyalty oath issues.
5. The ASSU Constitution, as pointed out by the
Law School, gives to Excom alone the power to de
tide which matters lie within ASSU jurisdiction.
