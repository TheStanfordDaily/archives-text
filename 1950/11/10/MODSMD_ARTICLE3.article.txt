TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 10â€”Ameri
can fighters and bombers roared
over North Korea again today in
the third day of an all-out air of
fensive to isolate the invading Chi
nese Communists from their Man
churian bases.
The air assault by land-based and
carrier planes followed up a full
scale assault Thursday in which pi
lots claimed to have wrecked five
bridges on the Communists' supply
routes into North Korea. Four Rus
sian-made fighters were destroyed.
Despite the air attacks, Chinese
reinforcements continued to pour
into the North Korean battle area,
amid suggestions that they planned
to create a "buffer state" on the
Korean side of the border.
