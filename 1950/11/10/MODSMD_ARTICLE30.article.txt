# In Response to Al Berry

To the Editor:
In response to Al Berry's article in Wednesday's
Daily, I agree that the real casualties in this "Civil
War" are members of the football team, and that
Stanford School Spirit is "lousy." However, I have
some different ideas as to "why" and "what should
be done."
I litlieve that school spirit depends upon confi
dence—confidence that the team is giving its very
Inst in an effort to win. School spirit at Stanford
"stinks" because the student body lias lost confidence
in the team and its coach.
Why don't we think the team is playing the game of
which it is capable? 'Ihe coach, some reply, or maybe
the junior vanity is too small. What are we going to
do about it. everybody asks? Nothing, says Al Berry,
because we're ladies and gentlemen at Stanford.
I think the student body ought to be presented with
as many facts as possible concerning this problem.
How about some reliuble, authoritative information on
Marchie's ability as a leader?
The players have a legitimate gripe when they say
the students can't tell anything from the stands, but
can you tell any more by asking the players or the
coach?
(»o ahead and ask a member of the varsity what he
thinks is the trouble with the team—ask him for
publication; what could he say?—except maybe lack
material, poor spirit, etc. If lie said be thought

Murchie was incapable ol' inspiring his players to
their best efforts, he would not only lose any chance
of starting against Washington State, he would ef
fectively demolish what spirit the team has left.
So maybe you'll have to divulge your "reasons of
national scope," Al, but in any case, we better make
some effort to get this ' rotten situation" out in the
open before it is too late.
I'm not stating flatly that Marchie ought to be re
tired especially without investigation, but I think
strenuous efforts should be made now, to clear the
air of vicious rumors of coach-team tension.
