To the Editor:
C.chids to Al Eerry! It leaves a little better taste in
our mouths to see that someone at The Daily has the
guts to put the blame for our miserable showing where
it belongs—on us, the students of Stanford. Every
person that has taken part in the recent "spontaneous"
demonstrations ought to realize that he has helped do
more harm to his school than Cal could ever dream
of doing.
You've started something worthwhile, Al. Keep it
going!
