To the Editor:
Some system is needed to curb the effusive and rau
cous exhibitionism of the numerous representatives of
of th" league of puerility attending the Sunday Eve
ning Movies.
'1 litre are a number of alternativesâ€”(l) Segregate
and extei minute them, (2) Encourage intra-high
school association as h stimulus to maturity, (3) Lavish
them with toys to compensate for deprivation during
earlier youth. In time basic ethical discriminations
could be introduced and some could be expected to
advance to moral puberty.
The rest could continue clapping, yelling, and whis
tling to gain some small happiness in life by giving
others an audible recognition of their existence.
Those responsible for management of the movie
might do well to put the comedy and serial after the
main feature. An acute perception characteristic of
the forementioned group invariably discovers tinges
of romanticism and triteness in the serial. The trump
eted discovery excites an exuberance that could bet
ter aspire as soliloquy after the show.
Other methods failing, the movie could either be
stopped following ample warning or persisent exhibi
tionists could be guided to a view of the moon to con
tinue their "sound and fury, signifying nothing."
