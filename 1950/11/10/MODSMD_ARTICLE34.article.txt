Vera Caspery's "Three Husbands,"
now in a premiere engagement at j
the Park in Menlo, is an entertain
ing variation on the Caspery-Man
kiewicz "Letter to Three Wives." |
This time it's the husbands who get
a note.
Although noticeably lacking the '
brilliant Mankiewicz dialogue and i
direction, "Three Husbands" shows

Their :%cne in a foreign-film thea
; ter, with every other line of a
Trench love scene being translated
; and with interspersed audeince

in "Three Wives."
"Three Husbands" unfortunately
i slips with each successive episode,
; so that the final part with Eve Ar
' den and Howard da Silva as "nou
| veaux riches" is particularly dis- j
| appointing.
Yet there are individual scenes i
which will stand among the fun
i niest and most clever of the year. |
