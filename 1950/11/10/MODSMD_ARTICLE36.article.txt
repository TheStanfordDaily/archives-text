# Finland Keeps Neutrality-- Says Exchange Student

### SUE GOODSTEIN 
"Every other American I meet wants to know if 1 was in Finland
when the Russians took over—Henrik de la Chapelle shook his
head emphatically, protesting that Finland is an independent coun
try and has not been occupied by any foreign power.
After the war Finland ceded certain territories to the Russians.

Today she is in the peculiar situation
of maintaining good relations with
the East and the West.
Finland's independent and neutral
position was emphasized by Henrik:
There are no restrictions imposed
upon the people they can read pa
pers from any country and are free
to travel. Finland is also one of the
few European countries that ex
changes athletic competitions with
countries in Western Europe as well
as with those behind the Iron Curtain.
The 1952 Olympic Games to be held
in Finland should also strengthen her
neutral status.
Henrik is doing graduate work in
the Business School as one <if Stan
ford's foreign scholarship students,
lie is a graduate of the Institute of
Technology in Helsinki, and studied
at the School for Advanced Cnm
mercial Studies in Paris.
Working in a Finnish paper mill
and in the exporting business, he has
furthered his interest in industrial
economy and management. Henrik
was rated by the Finnish committee
on selection as the "coming man" in
Finnish industry.
As a result of the war, Finland lost
about 25 per cent of her pulp indus
try, but she still holds an important
position in the world market as one
of the biggset exporters of pulp. In
flation was inevitable during the war
and has continued because of the ex
cessive rise in wages. Henrik attrib
utes this to the labor unions, which
have exerted tremendous power in
raising wages at least twice each year.
The biggest problem that faces Fin
land today is paying off her repara
tions debt to Russia. This is not pay
able in natural products such as pulp,
but in completely equipped paper
machines, which were not made in
Finland. For this reason Finland has
been forced to build new industries,
such as steel, which are not founded
on natural resources.
"If we can't find markets for
these products we'll have, to face
unemployment," Henrik explained.
He added that there is no actual
unemployment in Finland just now,
but with an increase in wages and
no markets for the new industries,
there is a danger of unemployment
next winter.
A large trade agreement was signed
with Russia this year so that when
the reparations arc paid, Russia will
pay for the machines Finland pro
duces, and so become one of her best
customers, along with Great Britain
and other Western powers. Although
this does not guarantee Finland's
success in this competitive field when
she has to import resources for ma
chines, it, does assert her indepen
dence from Russia.
In answer to the important question
of what "ism" is dominating Finland
economically and politically, Henrik
said it was the general opinion that

Finland is moving toward something
like Swedish socialism. According to
Henrik, who speaks for the conserva
tive element, Finland can't afford the
same type oJ a welfare state as
Sweden in the very near future.
Economic difficulties can already be
seen in tremendous amounts of social
expense.
Henrik emphasized that there has
been no socialization of industries,
but that the state owns those indus
tries which it has founded.
Finland's economic position is
good with a standard of living much
higher than in most European
countries, though lower than that
«if Sweden or Switzerland.
The structure of life in Finland is
similar to that of other Scandinavian
countries and shows a heritage of
Western influence. Henrik says that
for this reason, he and other Finnish
students find America a very easy
place to get along in.


A DREAM ON WHEELS—Henrik de la Chapelle, foreign scholarship student from Finland, has
finally realized his big ambition since his arrival at Stanford—to own a car. With the recent pur
chase of his '36 Chevy, he has explored San Francisco and Berkeley. He finds the traffic a bit
difficult, but the Chevy seems to be wearing quite well. —Daily photo by Don Dapelo
