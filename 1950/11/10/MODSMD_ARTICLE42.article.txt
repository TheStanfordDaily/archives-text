# UWF Proposes Membership Drive
## 
### 
A drive to get 1,000 new mem
bers for the Stanford Student Fed
eralists was proposed at the organi
zation's meeting Monday night.
The drive was-suggested by Frit
jof Thygeson, who explained that
he felt enough people were inter
ested and the cause was deserving
enough to make a 1,000-person goal
feasible. He recommended that the
Stanford group work more closely
with chapters in other schools.
