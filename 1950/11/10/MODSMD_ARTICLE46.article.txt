# Fearless Pickers Go on Rampage
## Pick Winless New Mexico Over Army 
### 
Suffering from "upsetitis," our j
peerless pickers come straggling ;
around the far turn with Sports Ed- |
itor Dwight Wilbur taking a com- |
manding seven-length lead.
Three unanimous choices — Yale, j
: SMU, and Cornell—all fell before j
j their respective opponents to leave
our crystal gazers holding not the !
ball, but the bag.
Wilbur, however, managed to j
i pick all the other games correct to {
wind up with 11 right and three j
wrong.
In the greatest mismatch since
Oshkosh took on the University of
Michigan and Centre played Geor
gia Tech (Georgia Tech won 222 to
0), Army plays host to New Mex
ico this week.
New Mexico so far this year has
lost to Arizona (Tempe) State 41 to
(5, West Texas State 45 to 6, Texas
Western 48 to 111, Wyoming 41 to 0,
and Arizona 38 to 0.
Possibly having received a flash I
over the Daily grapevine that the j
situation in Korea had become so
critical that the whole Army team
was to be shipped out there, Ihe
pickers put their heads together and
came up with New Mexico.

Three unanimous choices — Yale, j

Wilbur, however, managed to j

In the greatest mismatch since
Oshkosh took on the University of
Michigan and Centre played Geor
gia Tech (Georgia Tech won 222 to

New Mexico so far this year has
lost to Arizona (Tempe) State 41 to

pickers put their heads together and
