# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Enginners At Work AT DU PONT THEY FIGURE IMPORTANTLY IN MANY FIELDS 
### 
I~\ EC A USE Du Pont is a chemical
I company, you might, expect most
of its technical men to be chemists.
Actually, there are more engineers
than chemists at Du Pont. In each of
the ten manufacturing departments
there is important work for men
trained in chemical, mechanical,
electrical, metallurgical and other
branches of engineering.
These departments operate much
as independent units with their own
research, development, production
;ind sales staffs. In their respective
fields, they do fundamental and ap
plied research on both processes and
products. Sometimes engineers par
ticipate in the early stages of a proj
ect. More often, however, they enter
the picture when the project has
moved to the point where commer
cial production is considered. They
see it through the pilot plant and
J,CiUi works stages and assemble data

necessary for the full-scale plant.
Even after manufacturing has be
gun, development work is continued
to standardize and improve the proc
ess. Normally, engineers whose main
interest is production and plant op
eration take over when the works
stage is reached.
Engineers on the technical sales
staffs help maintain contact between
Du Pont and its customers. They
present data on new products and
guide customers in process develop
ment and similar problems. They
also ust; their technical knowledge in
making surveys of possible markets
for the Company's products.
In addition to the manufacturing
groups, the Du Pont Engineering
Department—a central staff organi
zation—requires engineers with many
types of training. This Department
carries on its own progrum of funda
mental and applied research. It also

makes site investigations, lays out
and designs new plants and labora
tories for the manufacturing depart
ments. It serves them in research on
process development, on materials
of construction and on methods of
measurement and control.
Yes, engineers figure importantly
at Du Pont. Through their teamwork
with chemists, physicists and other
trained p< rsonnel,the Du Pont Com
pany produces its "Better Things for
Better Living...through Chemistry."
