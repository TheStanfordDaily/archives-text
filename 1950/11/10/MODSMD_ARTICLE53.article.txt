# Five Sophs To Start For Washington State
## Cougars Match Indians With Loss To UCLA, USC Tie 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The Stanford varsity, very much
in need of a breather before round
ing out its season against the Big
Two, Army and Cal, are very apt
to discover tomorrow that Forrest
Evashevski's Washington State
Cougars do not fulfill the necessary
qualifications.
For the Cougars, sparked by 20
lettermen, have the necessary man
power to turn the tables on any
Coast team. Discounting their dis
mal opening game performance
against UCLA, the Staters have
shown great disdain for defeat.
They've been tied twice, by USC
and Idaho, but the Bruin reversal
remains the only loss on their 1950
schedule.
WSC's starting lineup contains
but two seniors, while five sopho
mores have been established in the
first rank. The five neophytes are
the top dogs of 26 — count 'em —
sophs who are numbered among
this year's varsity. However, only
hall of the newcomers will journey
to Palo Alto with the traveling
squad.
Posiion by position, the northern
ers stack up something like this:
ENDS: Height and youth are the
keynotes at the wing positions. Ed
Barker is (i ft. 3 in., only 18 years
old. Hal Lokovsek is 19, the same
height, but 10 pounds heavier than
Barker's 190. Both are sophomores
and comparative newcomers to the
game; but they've been dependable
performers all year. Evashevski
looks for big things from this pair
in the years to come.
Another sophomore, also G ft. 3
in., named Don Steinbrunner will
see plenty of action at end, has even
started twice in place of Lokovsek.
Don is a converted tackle, at which
position he was all - Washington
while in high school.
TACKLES: Jim Landy, 230-pound
bruiser of Indian descent, is the boy
to watch here. Jim is big and
rough, particularly hard to handle
when he's on the defense. He's a
junior, 19 years of age.
The other tackle slot is a toss-up
between Elmer Messenger and Bill
Bowen. Both lads top G feet and 200
pounds, but are lacking in experi
ence. Messenger is a sophomore,
Bowen a junior.

i GUAR! IS: Roosting place of the
team's "1 ttle" boys. Gil Diethelm
I and Gene Reiger get the nod; both
. weigh in tie low 180's. Reiser is
the one to keep your eyes on to
morrow.
He's a h ifctler and mighty rug
ged—"pounc. for pound the toughest
player on tl e squad,"' according to
Evashevski. Gene also claims an
other distinction: at 23 he'., the
granddaddy of the team.
CENTERS: At last — a senior!
, Captain LaVern Torgeson is Mr.
I Big of the Cougar forward wall.
I Now in his third year as a starting
center, Torgeson is Pullman's entry
in the Ail-American handicap, has
j long been recognized as one of the
finest pivotmen on the Coast. He's
21, weighs 205, specializes in line
backing.
QUARTERBACKS: Bob Gambold
is the second starting senior. He's
exceptionally big for a quarterback,
(j It. 3 in. and 200 pounds. Passing
is his favorite sport, but northern
reports claim Bob's blocking is also
greatly improved this season.
An all-around athlete, Gambold
played first-string forward with last
year's Northern Division hoop
champs.
He'll be spelled by 18-year-old
Bruce Smith, who played the posi
tion for the first time as a frosh last
year.
HALFBACKS: Byron Bailey, who
totes the ball or blocks for others
with equal precision, is being tout
ed for All-Coast consideration. A
guard in high school play, Bailey
has made the switch to the backfield
a profitable one by producing such
! efforts as last year's 84-yard TD
ramble against UCLA. He's a con
stant threat, loves to roll with kick
off returns.
The fifth starting soph, Dwight
Pool, is Bailey's running mate. D
Pool, is Bailey's running mate.
Dwight hasn't reached his full ca
pabilities as yet; but he's big (fi ft.
! 2 in.), rugged, and fast.
FULLBACKS: Ray Hobbs is the
starter, but the ex-Wyoming prep
standout will be spelled often by
China-born A 1 Charleton.
Hobbs has been the better block
i er of the two; Charleton prefers
running with the ball.
