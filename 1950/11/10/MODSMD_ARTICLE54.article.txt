SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 9 (UP)—
The greatest crop of All-America
candidates ever to perform on a
West Coast field since pre-war davs
will he battling for the spotlight
Saturday when the. Rose Bowl
bound Calilo riia Bears "entertain"
little brother Bruin from UCLA.
While Coach Lynn Waldorf of
Cal and Red Sanders of UCLA
hurled charge and counter charge
on whether the Bears "beat the
ball" in the line, and who should
wear what color jerseys, the public
appeared to be more interested in
possible stand-out performances by
these men:
Donn Moomaw, 225-pound soph
more linebacker for the Bruins,
who has been a positive standout in
nearly every game this year. He
has been described by scouts and
opposing players as one of the fin
est linebackers in college football—
a fellow who just loves to ram
head-on into an opponent.
Lts Richter, 225 - pound junior
linebacker for the Bears, who has
starred in nearly every game the
Waldorm wonders have played in
for two years. Richter is so valu
able that Waldorf ofttimes has to
use him on both offense (as a
guard) and the defense. A great
play diagnostician.
Bob Wilkinson, UCLA end, who
is rated as one of the finest pass
catchers in Western football his
tory, already holds a flock of PCC
records. Also, he's an all-around
football player whom Sanders used
as a safety man.
