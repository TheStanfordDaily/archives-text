# INTRA MURALS
## Men Are Separated From the Boys As Footballers Enter Home Stretch 
### LLOYD ROSENFELD 
As the last half of the quarter rolls
along, several kell-knit, sharp-look
in;? touch football squads are shaping
up a.s pennant contenders for the final
mural playoffs.
The marks of this handful of po
tential champions are evident in their
consistent blocking, well-oiled plays,
and flexible defense.
Ten divisions make up the mural
football league. Out of fairness,
groups of equal strength are sup
josedly matched together in the re
spective divisions. The leaders in
each division are as follows:
DIVISION 1
In Division 1 the Deke first team
ha;, earned a shutout record of four
wms. Fighting to overtake the
Dekes are Sterling Clayton, an Al
bert-type quarterback, and his
crcw of Kappa Sig I's.
DIVISION 2
The second division team to heat
is the mighty Firehouse — last
year's football champs. Firechaser
Monte Pfyl is the team's sparkplug.
His running and passing keeps the
Firehouse stock pretty high. Also
adding to the Firehouse winning
streak is the end who just keeps
pulling in the aerials: Dude Anguis.
Close behind the hook and ladder
engineers is the Phi Psi I aggregation
led by Elb Puckett. Puckett has
shown much talent in the art of non
chalantly flipping touchdowns.
DIVISION
Last year the SAE bunch came out
second best in the mural scramble. So
fa)' this annum they are leading the
pack with six wins. Partial credit
must be given the SAE running,
kicking, passing tailback Frank Cas
sela and brother Jim Brett, ball-

I hawk superb. The Delts are trailing
! the "dormers," but are not consid
ered especially dangerous.
DIVISION 4
Pre-season practice ied by Spon
sor Fred Chez helped organize the
frosh mural teams. Recently En
ema 2YV broke their tie with the
Basement by losing for the second
time. From here it looks like it's
the Basement in Division •!.
DIVISION 5
Toyon (Rogers) has pulled up to a
! level with the strong Encina 3E.
DIVISION <;
The Frosh Med School is pacing Di
i vision 6 with a perfect box score, four
! wins. However, Village 310 is still in
; the running, receiving two wins, one
! loss, and a tie.
DIVISION 7
Village 306 is leading the pack in I
Division 7.
DIVISION X
El Capitan's strong seven, after a j
much-protested loss, lead Division 8
[scoring four wins and one lie. Quar-
I terback Phil Gill combined with
Wayne Estill, agile end and defensive
safety, have put over many an El Cap |
touchdown.
Positioned behind rough El Capitan 1
linemen Heinzelman, Ziegler, and
Blaine, is talented pass-defender Bill
Cloughley.
Sceond-place Breakers, with one
loss is the team that may possibly
j pull victory from tin- Capitans.
Breakers standouts are Don Lie
haidorfer, hackfield aces Wally
Marks, star lineman.
DIVISION 112)
Delta Upsilon II and Sigma Chi II
have deadlocked in Division 9 with
four wins each. Both groups are

powerful. The winner will be on the !
long end of a lucky break.
DIVISION 10
The second Beta team winds up the j
league in the Division 10 high spot '
sporting four wins and one loss. More i
than average competition has pre
dominated in this division. Neverthe
less, several key Beta pass comple
tions have kept them in the league
scoring position.
Now that the good mural clubs
have pulled away from the pack, the
crucial games show deception, new
plays, better blocking, and real spirit.
It may be interesting lo turn out and
watch several of the title contenders
on the field.
