### 
FRESNO, Nov. 9 (UP) â€” Fresno ;
| State College ended 29 years ol grid
iron rivalry with the College of Pa
| cific today when officials disclosed |
j the Stockton Bengals had been j
dropped irom next year's schedule.
Loren Tuttle, director of FSC ath
i letics, explained that it was decided
to break football relations with COP
I because the teams now are "too un
| equal." He indicated Occidental Col
j lege may replace the Bengals on i
| Fresno's schedule.
The athletic director stressed that
, relations with the Stockton school al
! ways have been of the "highest" qual- i
| ity, and said he hoped competition
can be resumed when Fresno ha>
completed a "sound rebuilding pro- j
| gram" in football.
Pacific romped over the Bulldogs
I 52 to 7, earlier this season in what
Coach Duke Jacobs described as a
"terrific physical beating."
In 29 games, Fresno has won 1G and j
COP 12, while one contest ended in
a tie. General feeling here that the
Bulldogs were out of their clasj re- I
suited from four successive losses to I
Pacific, including 55 to 0 and 45 to 0 I
trourcings in 1948 and 1949.
