TOKYO, Monday, Nov. 13 (UP)—
South Korean troops counterat
tacked today along the Kunrui-
Tokchon highway in North Central
Korea a few hours after Chinese
Communists struck into the heart
of the Allied line for gains up to
five miles.
In the northeast sector, the
American Seventh Division — con
stituting the United Nations troops
nearest the Manchurian border—
dug in along the Ungi River and
fanned out eastward and westward
toward the flanks of Communist
forces resisting U.S. Marines and
South Koreans.
