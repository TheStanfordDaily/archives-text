## Kickoff for the Charity Goal 
### 
With the fall quarter charity drive getting
under way this morning, Stanford students can
chalk up another mark on the progress chart. It
was only last year that the problems of reoc
curring requests for charity donations brought
scores of complaints.
Since then, an Excom committee polled the
students' reaction to the significant charities,
and set up a schedule so only one major contri
bution would be sought each quarter.
Small changes have affected the original
plan, but the big fall drive, which includes can
cer, foreign relief, the Palo Alto Youth Fund,
and a floating fund, seems a definite improve
ment over the old system.
In reaching down into their pockets to help
meat the $4,500 goal, students must remember
the individual charities are taking somewhat of
a loss by being mixed into one melting pot. If
separate drives were to be held by the Youth
Fund, SIRO, or the Cancer Society, the aggre
gate of the individual goals might total $6,000.
But for the convenience of students, Cardi
nals who is sponsoring the drive, is reducing
the number of collections to one this quarter.
Hence a substantial contribution is desired from
everyone.
To give one example of the problem, the for
eign relief fund whiclj will receive only 30 per
cent, or about $1,500 of the total funds, normally

has obligations close to $2,500. If the drive falls
short, the promised funds will have to be
squeezed out by other benefit projects.
Some may say "Why should Stanford stu
dents be expected to contribute to the Palo Alto
Youth Fund?" We can only call your attention
to the $5,700 the campus YWCA gets from this
charity fund, in comparison with the $2,000
which Stanford tries to raise for the Youth drive
each year.
Stanford men as well as "Y" members benefit
from the student-faculty discussions and the
student workshop — both "Y"-sponsored proj
ects.
The local implications of the cancer drive are
certainly evidenced by the research conducted
by Stanford scientists in the field of cancer con
trol.
The floating fund, v/hich consists of 10 per
cent of the fall relief drive, is distributed by
the Excom according to requests from special
charities during the year, such as the Crippled
Children's Fund, Negro scholarships, the North
west flood emergency, and the Ecuador earth
quake tragedy.
The fall charity drive, unified for the first
time, is a definite improvement over last year's
SIRO failure.
With the support of the student body, the
kickoff on a new charity drive system will cer
tainly bring the goal—s4,soo.
