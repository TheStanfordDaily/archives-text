# Vandals Burn 2nd 'C' on Campus Turf
## 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
Another "C" was burnt on Stan
ford lawns over the weekend.
The latest act in Big Gatne ri
valry occurred at 1:20 a.m. Friday.
An unidentified person rang the
alarm box outside Hoover Tower
and the fire department, thinking
the tower was afire, sent three
trucks to the scene.
The fire turned out to be another
"C," this time on the lawn in front
of the tower. The "C" measured
about 15 feet square, while a large
"period" burnt another five square
feet of grass.
Although no one has reported
seeing the arsonists, close investiga
tion of the scene disclosed that they
were both backward and block
heads.
They were backward because the
period was misplaced in back of the
"C" instead of in front of it.
They were blockheads because
the "C," instead of being its usual
curvaceous self, had squared cor
ners and an extended lower lip.
The last "C" was burnt on cam
pus grass Sunday afternoon, Oct.
22. The automobile in which the
firebugs escaped on this occasion
was described and its license num
ber reported to the police.
The number was recently issued

to an owner, as yet unidentified,
living in the Bay Area.
