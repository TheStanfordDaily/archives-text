### AL BERRY 
In the light of current events, it seems amazing to
rne that Stanford University—our Stanford! —has been
able to survive the constant crash of the outside world
for lo long without the bolstering and all-helplul aid

of some sort of loyalty oath.
Now I don't mean that we
should make like Cal (rabble, rab
ble, rabble) and force our profs
to alfix their names to a document
which states that they hav.en't and
they won't and if they do they are
only kidding, " V/e of Stanford
should go further faster than our
Berkeley brethren.

The students must take the lead and move the move
ment. But we must, or should, advance subtly on this
thing. In order to quell objections which may be forth
coming from the people who have actually been tq an
Fxcom meeting, we shall take insidious, but neverthe
less effective steps.
First of all, a simple arrangement with the priifter
who makes out test blue-books will settle most of
the "How To Get Students To Sign" problem. Where
the blue books now require you to sign a small petition
thai you didn't peak, didn't sneak, and the poop didn't
leak, we will simply insert the magic and all-wonder
-1 u 1 words "I have not and will never be a member of
a political party." Since nobody reads it —with 15
liours of writing to do in 50 minutes, who's going to
do pleasure leading—all students who take midterms
and finals will, after a brief scratching of the pen, be
accredited and loyal citizens of the U.S., California,
Siinta Clara County, and Local 114.
It's so simple: Excom doesn't have to tree itself. The

Jonasites have nothing to martyr themselves for. And
the vast student body can go back to worrying about
the exploits of Prince Valiant.
There are, of course, people who don't take finals,
and possibly a segment who for some hideous reason
do not sign what they think is the Honor Code on
the te«t booklet. We've got to get these people in on
the deal. This is a closed shop proposition. We can't
have anyone unloyal running around the Farm.
Thus, we must call in the campus coppers (officers
to you). These able, industrious gentlemen, so far this
year, have given 270,059 packing tickets to Stanford
students. Again—in the process of ticketing—a sig
nature should be forthcoming. Ha-do you follow me?
Instead of pleading guilty to the heinous offense of
overtime standing, the new tickets will have the of
fender doing something worthwhile.
The tickets will say: "I am not and will not be some
thing that is bad to see. But I parked my car too long,
so I admit I was so wrong. But as a patriot I am no
vixen. Down with Stalin, up with Nixon. Hah, rah,
Free Enterprise. Down with everybody left of me."
Thus, all traffic violators on the Stanford campus
would have to sign a version of the California Loyalty
Oath.
Not only will this bring us closer to our fine, friendly
rival across the Bay, but Stanford, our Stanford, would
then be fully protected against Reds, Communists, and
spies. Then the Army football team, arriving this
week, will realize that we are fine, upstanding, loyal
boosters of the U.S. Army, and as such we should be
treated as allies, not like the Germans in Tunisia.
Or, maybe we had better get to work on that bomb
shelter under the Quad.

The students must take the lead and move the move
ment. But we must, or should, advance subtly on this
thing. In order to quell objections which may be forth
coming from the people who have actually been tq an
Fxcom meeting, we shall take insidious, but neverthe
less effective steps.
First of all, a simple arrangement with the priifter
who makes out test blue-books will settle most of
the "How To Get Students To Sign" problem. Where
the blue books now require you to sign a small petition
thai you didn't peak, didn't sneak, and the poop didn't
leak, we will simply insert the magic and all-wonder
-1 u 1 words "I have not and will never be a member of
a political party." Since nobody reads it —with 15
liours of writing to do in 50 minutes, who's going to
do pleasure leading—all students who take midterms
and finals will, after a brief scratching of the pen, be
accredited and loyal citizens of the U.S., California,
Siinta Clara County, and Local 114.
It's so simple: Excom doesn't have to tree itself. The

Jonasites have nothing to martyr themselves for. And
the vast student body can go back to worrying about
the exploits of Prince Valiant.
There are, of course, people who don't take finals,
and possibly a segment who for some hideous reason
do not sign what they think is the Honor Code on
the te«t booklet. We've got to get these people in on
the deal. This is a closed shop proposition. We can't
have anyone unloyal running around the Farm.
Thus, we must call in the campus coppers (officers
to you). These able, industrious gentlemen, so far this
year, have given 270,059 packing tickets to Stanford
students. Again—in the process of ticketing—a sig
nature should be forthcoming. Ha-do you follow me?
Instead of pleading guilty to the heinous offense of
overtime standing, the new tickets will have the of
fender doing something worthwhile.
The tickets will say: "I am not and will not be some
thing that is bad to see. But I parked my car too long,
so I admit I was so wrong. But as a patriot I am no
vixen. Down with Stalin, up with Nixon. Hah, rah,
Free Enterprise. Down with everybody left of me."
Thus, all traffic violators on the Stanford campus
would have to sign a version of the California Loyalty
Oath.
Not only will this bring us closer to our fine, friendly
rival across the Bay, but Stanford, our Stanford, would
then be fully protected against Reds, Communists, and
spies. Then the Army football team, arriving this
week, will realize that we are fine, upstanding, loyal
boosters of the U.S. Army, and as such we should be
treated as allies, not like the Germans in Tunisia.
Or, maybe we had better get to work on that bomb
shelter under the Quad.

In the light of current events, it seems amazing to
rne that Stanford University—our Stanford! —has been
able to survive the constant crash of the outside world
for lo long without the bolstering and all-helplul aid

of some sort of loyalty oath.
Now I don't mean that we
should make like Cal (rabble, rab
ble, rabble) and force our profs
to alfix their names to a document
which states that they hav.en't and
they won't and if they do they are
only kidding, " V/e of Stanford
should go further faster than our
Berkeley brethren.
