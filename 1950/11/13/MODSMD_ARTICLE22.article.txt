(Editor's Note.—Last Friday, the Daily announced
editorially that the Marchie Schwartz five-year
contract issue was henceforth closed to student opin
ion through letters to the editor.
(This policy was dictated by the fact that we had
been receiving a large number of letters—both pro
and con—that, for the most part, repeated them
selves. In short, it was our feeling that further pub
lication of letters in toto would not only result in low
morale among team members, students, and all con
cerned wit'll Stanford, but would also constitute an
unnecessary use of valuable'newspaper space.
(As •; consequence, we hereby present excerpts
from many letters that have as yet gone unpub
lished. Most of the letters were received prior to
last Friday's editorial.
(In (he future, of course, we will welcome any fur
ther correspondence that in our judgment is ger
mane to the question and discusses points not al
ready mentioned.)
