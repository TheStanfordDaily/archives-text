To the Editor:
Football talk in recent weeks has centered around
the regaining of Stanford's pre-war glory. Yet we
hove failed to realize that there is something at stake
a lot more important than glory: Money, lots of it.
... If we survive, we must resolve to be among the
top five or six teams in the nation, year after year. Any
lesser goal will only lead to athletic and financial em
banassment. In short, if we're going to dirty our hands
with this football racket, we are going to have to go
all the way.
This means:
1. Better coaches at bigger salaries.
2. More athletic scholarships— two platoon ball calls
for longer benches.
:j. A stricter training program.
A. A better recruiting system.
!». More indirect "rewards"-to our gridiron stars .. .

... A great part of the University's income is de
lived from lootball receipts. In the last five years these
receipts have been far less than they would have been
il we had had a coach better adapted to teaching such
intricacies of football as blocking, tackling, and pass
defense.
. . . two tuition raises in three years seem to show a
need for every dollar. It therefore behooves the Uni
versity to do something about the football situation.
Tin University Athletic Board, everyone is happy to
learn, has done just that—they rehired the man who
for five years has caused this situation.
