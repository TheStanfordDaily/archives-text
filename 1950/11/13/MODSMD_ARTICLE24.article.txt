# An Issue with "Mr. Berry"
## 
### 
To the Editor:
My main quarrel with Mr. Berry ... (is that) . . .
hi would have us believe that those favoring a new
coach "make the vilest remarks about these men (the
coach and team members) â€”not as coaches and play
ers but as men." . . . The issue is coaching ability,
Mr. Berry, let's not try to change it to personality.
