# Stanford Critique

To the Editor:
. . . Old bromides .such as "Stanford, Where the
Winds of Freedom Blow," and "student government"
have been wiven concrete meaning through example.
It is now clear that what they mean is thi.s: you can
say v/hat you want at Stanford; you can gather a ma
jority of students believing as you do; you might even
j-et all ol the students believing as you do—and it
doesn't make a . . . bit of difference as far as what
happens around here goes.
... at Stanford the winds of student freedom blow
but . . . they move nothing the Administration
hasn't already planned to move.
(then) . . . there is the idea that a university sacri
fices immeasurable esteem when it replaces an unsuc

cessful football coach. . . . any student who doubts
the validity of the reasoning behind the idea need only
observe the tremendous ill-favor and disrepute which
have come to the University of California since the
students of that university ousted Frank Wickhorst in
favor of Pappy Waldorf. . . .
