To the Editor (also to Alumni Association):
"I am replying to your request for donations to the
Stanford Fund; unfortunately, I cannot possibly con
tribute due to the sums of money I have lost wagering
on our "Big Red Machine" this season. I will be more
than happy to do my share as soon as we field a win
ning football team or one that lives up to its potential.
As I see it, this will only be possible when we replace
Marchie Schwartz with a football coach. . . .

To the Editor:
(My wife and I, both alumni) have planned to budget
a certain portion of our money each year to be used
for athletic purposes. However, you will notice no
check is enclosed. .
... in my memory span never have I seen a Stan
ford team with more good, big, physically equipped
talent than this year. The 1940 team, as great as they
were, didn't have over 20 really good football players
on it. . . . The Stanford Frosh haven't lost but one
game in four years. You figure it out.
... As of now you may scratch me and my wife
from your contribution mailing list.

P.S. As of this writing I know at least five "Buck
of the Month" members who will not be sending in
their yearly dues in the future.
