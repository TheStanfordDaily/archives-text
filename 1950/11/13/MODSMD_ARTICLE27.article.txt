To the Editor:
. . . Maybe we do need a new coach! We would
welcome renewed fire in our football team—we would
like to win games. But it is so easy to blame one indi
vidual entirely—when the trouble could be caused
from so many factors.
. . . It's not Marchie we're against, but the.fact that
our dream of roses is nof coming true.. . . Alter five
years of good work, on the part of Marchie's coaching
. . ~ we'd sincerely like to see him as Director of
Athletics instead. . . .
