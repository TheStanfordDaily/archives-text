# On Airing Band Stunts
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I am a loyal supporter of the band and I take a
great interest in its stunts and music during half time
at each Saturday's game. I marvel at the way the band
quickly forms its intricate patterns and then plays
appropriate music.
1 do have one criticism to make, however, but not
about the band itself. I would like to suggest that each
stunt be announced over the public address system as
it is performed. It would be a great help in deciphering
the stunts, especially to the rooters and fans on the
Stanford side who have to see the formations upside
down.
1 he UCLA band stunts were announced down at
the Coliseum in the southland and I really appre
ciated knowing what they were even when they were
i ight side up for the Stanford side.
Let's have the band stunts announced for the Armv
game!

director, has explained that commentary on the
loudspeaker of the band's lialftime stunts is not
X'v< ii, because his office feels (he crowd would
rather lie relieved from the extra noise. The Uni
versity of Washington and both UCLA and USC
have used the public address system effectively to
describe the band formations.)
