# Constitution 'Rescued' In New Book
## 
### JOY HAAS 
A very important book goes
on sale today. "Your Rugged
Constitution," published by the
Stanford University Press, is a
graphic blueprint of the United
States Constitution.
It rescues the Constitution from
scholarly oblivion and the forbidding
language of lawyers, and returns it
to the American public.
"Your Rugged Constitution" pic
tu res the federal government as
the builder commissioned by "we
the people," to erect and maintain
<jur House of Freedom.
The President is the executive con
tractor who enforces the laws- Con
gress operates the mills that furnish
legislative materials, and the Su
preme Court inspects the work. Us
ing this symbolism, the book pre
sents the Constitution as a working
model for good government.
This I ook is the first of the Stan
ford American Ideals Series, con
ceived as a constructive answer to
the charge that American colleges are
teaching Communism and do nothing
about teaching Americanism. The
series is financed by a gift of $80,000
from Mr. and Mrs. Gordon B. Crary
and Mr. and Mrs. Allan H. Crary,
all of Los Angeles.
Richard Dawson, California artist
and Stanford graduate, hitches his
sense of humor to his paint brush,
then gives the team free rein for
drawing modern Constitutional in
terpretations. For example, he pic
tures the nine executive departments
as occupying drawers in a cabinet.
"Your Rugged Constitution" and
other hooks in the series to explain
American ideals are the product of
research and writing by 30 indi
viduals, including Dean John
Bartky of Stanford School of Edu
cation and John C. Almack. pro
fessor of education emeritus.
Already a large audience is antici
pating an enthusiastic public recep
tion of this book. It is expected to
be involved in patriotic ventures
such as the Voice of America and
may get viewed on television.
The attractive red, white, and blue
publication is now on sale at the
campus Bookstore for $3. It is in
dexed for easy reference, and writ
ten for an entertaining understand
ing of "Your Rugged Constitution."
