# Nitrogen Mustards Aid In Cancer Studies Here
## 
### HARRY GLAZE 
One of the many major proj
ects being carried out in the field
of cancer research at Stanford is
the study of the nitrogen mus
tards and their effect on living
tissues.
Thirty per cent of the money j
collected from this week's cancer
drive will go toward financing re
search here at the University, and
will enable projects such as this to
continue.
Working on this study are Dr. E. [
L. Tatum, professor of biological
sciences; Dr. A. Clark Griffin, as- i
sistant professor oi chemistry; and .
Miss Genie Brandt, graduate stu
dent in biochemistry.
Basic Causes
In seeking methods by which
cancer may be cured, scientists j
have been attempting to determine I
the basic causes of this group of >
diseases called cancer. Many theo- i
ries as to the causes of cancer have 1
been proposed. One of these is that
the production oi cancer is the re
sult of a certain change, or muta
tion, in the cells ol the organism af
fected.
Since the nitrogen mustards are
very active in bringing about such
changes, the Stanford scientists
have attempted to determine
whether these compounds would
induce cancer in experimental ani
mals.
Cellular Changes
"I think we have proved conclu
sively that the nitrogen mustards
do bring about these cellular
changes that lead to cancer," said
Dr. Griffin. "Our research thus far
has been successful," he continued,
"and I believe that further studies
with these interesting compounds
will add greatly to our knowledge
( of the cancerous diseases."
Nitrogen mustards are similar in
chemical structure to the mustard
gas used in World War. They were
developed by German scientists
during the second World War as
potential war gases. Here in the
5 United States, however, the widest
application of research with these
compounds has been in connection
| with the treatment of leukemia and
| other forms of cancer.
For the past year Dr. Tatum, Dr.
j Griffin, and Miss Brandt have been
! injecting the nitrogen mustards into
! mice and rats. Three different types
' of injections were given. Some ani
j inals received one injection, while
j others received many extending

over a period of several months.
Results of these experiments
showed that a high incidence of
cancer developed in the mice and
rats. This demonstrated an impor
tant property of the nitrogen mus
tards and also produced additional
evidence for the theory of cell
changes in cancer. The Stanford
scientists also observed that even a
single injection into an animal
would produce highly malignant
tumors.

These findings have recently been
published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
Dr. Griffin, while attending the
Fifth International Cancer Congress
held at Paris in July, learned that
workers in the Royal Cancer Hos
pital in London were conducting
research with the nitrogen mus
tards similar to that being done at
Stanford. Their findings were in
substantial agreement with the
Stanford studies.

money goes! Working with the nitrogen mustards in an attempt
to solve the problem of cancer are Miss Genie Brandt and Dr. A.
Clark Griffin. These Stanford scientists have observed that the
•compounds will produce cancer in experimental animals.

One of the many major proj
ects being carried out in the field
of cancer research at Stanford is
the study of the nitrogen mus
tards and their effect on living
tissues.
Thirty per cent of the money j
collected from this week's cancer
drive will go toward financing re
search here at the University, and
will enable projects such as this to
continue.
Working on this study are Dr. E. [
L. Tatum, professor of biological
sciences; Dr. A. Clark Griffin, as- i
sistant professor oi chemistry; and .
Miss Genie Brandt, graduate stu
dent in biochemistry.
Basic Causes
In seeking methods by which
cancer may be cured, scientists j
have been attempting to determine I
the basic causes of this group of >
diseases called cancer. Many theo- i
ries as to the causes of cancer have 1
been proposed. One of these is that
the production oi cancer is the re
sult of a certain change, or muta
tion, in the cells ol the organism af
fected.
Since the nitrogen mustards are
very active in bringing about such
changes, the Stanford scientists
have attempted to determine
whether these compounds would
induce cancer in experimental ani
mals.
Cellular Changes
"I think we have proved conclu
sively that the nitrogen mustards
do bring about these cellular
changes that lead to cancer," said
Dr. Griffin. "Our research thus far
has been successful," he continued,
"and I believe that further studies
with these interesting compounds
will add greatly to our knowledge
( of the cancerous diseases."
Nitrogen mustards are similar in
chemical structure to the mustard
gas used in World War. They were
developed by German scientists
during the second World War as
potential war gases. Here in the
5 United States, however, the widest
application of research with these
compounds has been in connection
| with the treatment of leukemia and
| other forms of cancer.
For the past year Dr. Tatum, Dr.
j Griffin, and Miss Brandt have been
! injecting the nitrogen mustards into
! mice and rats. Three different types
' of injections were given. Some ani
j inals received one injection, while
j others received many extending

over a period of several months.
Results of these experiments
showed that a high incidence of
cancer developed in the mice and
rats. This demonstrated an impor
tant property of the nitrogen mus
tards and also produced additional
evidence for the theory of cell
changes in cancer. The Stanford
scientists also observed that even a
single injection into an animal
would produce highly malignant
tumors.

These findings have recently been
published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
Dr. Griffin, while attending the
Fifth International Cancer Congress
held at Paris in July, learned that
workers in the Royal Cancer Hos
pital in London were conducting
research with the nitrogen mus
tards similar to that being done at
Stanford. Their findings were in
substantial agreement with the
Stanford studies.
