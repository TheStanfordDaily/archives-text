# The 						Sporting Line

### DICK KLEIN 
While Cal snapped up the head
lines by drubbing UCLA, Army
quietly and effectively rolled over
weak New Mexico. The Army boys
were so concerned over their 27th
victim that backs Gil Stephenson
and Jim Cain forgot to suit up and
Coach Earl Blaik took off for the
Navy-Tulane game. To say that the
Cadets took the game in easy stride
is like underestimating their actual
ability. Anyway, they won going
away, 51 to 0.
Meanwhile, Army's a d van c e
guard for the highly effective
Black Knights took note of Stan
ford grid offerings. Their scouts
were at work. For the fourth
Saturday, Coach Paul Amen of
the West Point staff failed to see
much. He has now witnessed the
UCLA, Washington, Southern Cal.
and Washington State football
farces. "There's a lot of potential
on that Stanford team, but they
don't always show it."
Amen (whose name is not pro
nounced like the end of a prayer,
but might as well be as far as Stan
lord's football future is concerned)
has been on Blaik's staff all during
the war. And ii that's not enough
of a recommendation, take a look
at what's happened to a low of the
Cadet wartime assistants. Gustafson
is head coach at undefeated Miami,
Hickman is boss at Yale, and Stu
Holcomb has done all right with the
Boilermakers of Purdue.
During the week, the tall, well
built Amen puts Dan Foldberg and
Co. through their paces. Then on
weekends he planes out to see
Stanford. Helping with the scouting
Ibis weekend were Army's head
statistician and also Cliff Thomp
son, former Nebraska quarterback
on the '41 Rose Bowl team. Thomp
son, who served as a scout and as
sistant coach at the Point during the
war, has given up the coaching pro
fession. He is working for a Ph.D.
in physics at Berkeley.
Together they formed one of the
smoothest - functioning scouting
units we have ever witenssed.
Amen, sitting in the middle, had a
neatly mimeographed booklet with
a chart for every offensive Stanford
play. And enough pages for all sorts
of Card defensive alignments. As
each play unfolded, the three would
work their pencils in unison. Amen
tabbed the ball-carrier and inter
ference, Thompson mapped the line
play, and the ether diagrammed the
path of the cfrds and men-in-mo
tion.
The co - ordinated effort was a
to behold. Those six eyes
rrissed hardly a thing. The trio
even made notes on who got in
jured and how badly. They com
mented on how Bryan had slowed
up from previous weeks.
As for the Stanford picture in
general, some of the comments
proved interesting. "Bryan is the
best back; he is fast and drives
fairly hard." "There is plenty of
lightning speed oli the team. But
there is little blocking and tack
ling."
In answer to a query about Stan
ford's poor performances on several
Saturdays, the Armymen all agreed
that "Stanford has not played near
potential because of a lack of those
doubtful intangibles." Such an ab
sence might be attributed to team
dissension, they thought, but none
seemed able to put their finger on
the exact trouble.
McColl and Pomeroy both rated
high in their opinions. "Those two
could play on almost any team."
McColl continually displays his
ability as an All-American, and
his grid savvy on the spectacular
touchdown play demonstrated his
"one out of 50 good football play
ers" talent.
For the blond powerhouse, they
mentioned Pomeroy's uncanny abil
ity to sense a play and then "throw
himself into a hole and plug up a
play." That action is less spectacu
lar but just as important as his nu
merous tackles.
Throwing a little light on the
current Farm controversy, the
Army scouts considered Marchie
Schwartz a capable coach. They
pointed out that Marchie's ability
has never been questioned in any
circle where people are close to
the game of football.
As Amen closed up his scouting
book and relaxed for the first time
in several hours, he countered with
the idea that he would expect a
lot of new stuff from Stanford next
Saturday. "Any coach of Marchie's
caliber should come up with a bag
ful of tricks for us."

don't always show it."
Amen (whose name is not pro
nounced like the end of a prayer,
but might as well be as far as Stan
lord's football future is concerned)
has been on Blaik's staff all during
the war. And ii that's not enough
of a recommendation, take a look
at what's happened to a low of the
Cadet wartime assistants. Gustafson
is head coach at undefeated Miami,
Hickman is boss at Yale, and Stu
Holcomb has done all right with the
Boilermakers of Purdue.
During the week, the tall, well
built Amen puts Dan Foldberg and
Co. through their paces. Then on
weekends he planes out to see
Stanford. Helping with the scouting
Ibis weekend were Army's head
statistician and also Cliff Thomp
son, former Nebraska quarterback
on the '41 Rose Bowl team. Thomp
son, who served as a scout and as
sistant coach at the Point during the
war, has given up the coaching pro
fession. He is working for a Ph.D.
in physics at Berkeley.
Together they formed one of the
smoothest - functioning scouting
units we have ever witenssed.
Amen, sitting in the middle, had a
neatly mimeographed booklet with
a chart for every offensive Stanford
play. And enough pages for all sorts
of Card defensive alignments. As
each play unfolded, the three would
work their pencils in unison. Amen
tabbed the ball-carrier and inter
ference, Thompson mapped the line
play, and the ether diagrammed the
path of the cfrds and men-in-mo
tion.
The co - ordinated effort was a
to behold. Those six eyes
rrissed hardly a thing. The trio
even made notes on who got in
jured and how badly. They com
mented on how Bryan had slowed
up from previous weeks.
As for the Stanford picture in
general, some of the comments
proved interesting. "Bryan is the
best back; he is fast and drives
fairly hard." "There is plenty of
lightning speed oli the team. But
there is little blocking and tack
ling."
In answer to a query about Stan
ford's poor performances on several
Saturdays, the Armymen all agreed
that "Stanford has not played near
potential because of a lack of those
doubtful intangibles." Such an ab
sence might be attributed to team
dissension, they thought, but none
seemed able to put their finger on
the exact trouble.
McColl and Pomeroy both rated
high in their opinions. "Those two
could play on almost any team."
McColl continually displays his
ability as an All-American, and
his grid savvy on the spectacular
touchdown play demonstrated his
"one out of 50 good football play
ers" talent.
For the blond powerhouse, they
mentioned Pomeroy's uncanny abil
ity to sense a play and then "throw
himself into a hole and plug up a
play." That action is less spectacu
lar but just as important as his nu
merous tackles.
Throwing a little light on the
current Farm controversy, the
Army scouts considered Marchie
Schwartz a capable coach. They
pointed out that Marchie's ability
has never been questioned in any
circle where people are close to
the game of football.
As Amen closed up his scouting
book and relaxed for the first time
in several hours, he countered with
the idea that he would expect a
lot of new stuff from Stanford next
Saturday. "Any coach of Marchie's
caliber should come up with a bag
ful of tricks for us."
While Cal snapped up the head
lines by drubbing UCLA, Army
quietly and effectively rolled over
weak New Mexico. The Army boys
were so concerned over their 27th
victim that backs Gil Stephenson
and Jim Cain forgot to suit up and
Coach Earl Blaik took off for the
Navy-Tulane game. To say that the
Cadets took the game in easy stride
is like underestimating their actual
ability. Anyway, they won going
away, 51 to 0.
Meanwhile, Army's a d van c e
guard for the highly effective
Black Knights took note of Stan
ford grid offerings. Their scouts
were at work. For the fourth
Saturday, Coach Paul Amen of
the West Point staff failed to see
much. He has now witnessed the
UCLA, Washington, Southern Cal.
and Washington State football
farces. "There's a lot of potential
on that Stanford team, but they
