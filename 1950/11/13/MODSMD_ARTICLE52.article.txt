# Braves Win; Beat SFSC By 41 to 19
## 
### 
The Stanford Braves raised their
tomahawk high and brought it
down hard on the head of San
Francisco State's junior varsity to
the tune of 41 to 19, Saturday.
Scoring was fast and furious as
the Braves brought home their
fourth scalp in as many outings.
Getting off to a quick .start, the
JV's left the field at half time ahead
34 to 0. Coach Max Kimberly sent
numerous first - stringers to the
showers early in an attempt to hold
down the score. Field goals were
tried several times instead of going
for six points when in striking dis
tance.
These are the men who scored for
the Braves: John Baker tallied
twice on runs of 15 and 20 yards.
Bob French went over from 1.5
yards out. Bill Heilbron scored
itwice, on a breakaway sprint of 50
and one from closer in which net
ted 20. Bill McKay added another
with a 10-yard pay-dirt jaunt.
French and McKay added two
conversions apiece with Baker
picking up the other.
Brilliant line play by Whitey
Pyle, Dick Borda, and Don Lucas
had a great deal to do with the
Braves' sustained drives and
breakaways.
As far as State it was a story
of too little too late. The junior
Gators opened their scoring in the
third period when Mike Franconi
picked off a Steve Mitchell flat
pass and ran it back 30 yards to a
TD. George Camoratta converted.
Late in the fourth period, playing
against second and third Brave de
fensive units, the State JV's scored
twice.
Next week the Braves meet the
Presidio of San Francisco. Looks
lrt<e Army Day on the Farm.
