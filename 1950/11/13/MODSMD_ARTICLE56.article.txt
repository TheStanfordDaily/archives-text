# Card Water Poloists Triumph Twice
## 
### 
Stanford's red - hot water polo
team clinched at least second spot
I in the PCC by trouncing UCLA
Friday afternoon, G to 1. The win
j was the fifth in a row for the In
dians, and they added their sixth
j Saturday over the Olympic Club,
! 3 to 1.
Friday's game started ovx to be
; a tightly played contest. At half-
I time the Indians had only a 2 to 0
lead, accumulated on a first-period
| goal by Hub Stokeley and a beau
j tiful second-quarter .shot by Don
Weeden.
j Stanford plunked in three more
goals, including a beautiful driving
j in shot by Erwin Johnson; and the
Bruins fought back in the closing

minutes to score their lone point as
Coach Tom Haynie did everything
but clear the bench.
Saturday's contest was a much
less decisive affair. The Cards had
let down somewhat from their
pitch of Friday, but were still able
to generate a 2 to 0 lead in the
first quarter. Co-captains Stokeley
and Weeden were the point-mak
ers.

There was no more goal-cage ac
tivity until the last period.
