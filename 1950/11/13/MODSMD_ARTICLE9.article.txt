# Cards Come from Behind to Whip Cougars
## Weird TD Play Cinches Contest 
### PETE GROTHE 
A stunned Red Indian looked up at the scoreboard last Saturday,
and finding himself 12 points in the hole, fought back for a 28 to 18
triumph over a surprisingly potent Washington State team.
Stanford, in its victory, was hot and cold, showing sensational
scoring punch one moment and ineptness the next. It was good

experience for the Cards, since they"
may have to do some coming from
behind in their next two games
(Army and Cal).
The game also gave Stanford
rooters the feeling that there may
he a spark of hope against Army.
Observers saw that the Indians did
their scoring in wide-open style,
and that if they play it wide open
next week, there may he a chance.
The Cards' game-clinching touch
down was a result of such wide open
play. In fact old-timers can't remem
ber when they a play that com
bined more comedy and artistry than
the Kerkorian to McColl to Benson
scorcher.
With Stanford on lis own 42, Ker
korian wheeled hack and hit Mc-
Coll with an accurate heave 011 the
27. McColl, with three WSC de
fenders on the verge of making a
tackle, faked a lateral to half Boyd
Benson. The Cougars gave chase to
Benson, and McColl rumbled live
more yards before the WSCcrs saw
that McColl had never gotten rid
of the oval.
They plowed into McColl, but this
time Big Bill threw to Benson, who
ran laterally to his right. Benson
found himself trapped at the right
sidelines, so he circled back to the
left and then boomed straight up
the middle for the score, leaving a
maze of goggle-eyed Washington
defenders sprawling 011 the ground.
The Cougars from Pullman way
were the first to sample the end zone.
They took the ball on their own 39
and drove the remaining distance in
eight plays. The payoif came when
Bob Gambold, Washington's excel
lent quarterback, found end Ed Bar
ker in the end zone lor a 13-yard pass.
Bobby Bryan returned the ensuing
kickofl 41 yatds and wasn t tot) far
from going the whole way. He fum
bled, however, and the Cougars were
given new life. They took advantage
of their good fortune, as a few min
utes later the same Gambold hit the
same Barker in the same end zone
for a score, 12 to 0.
But here was where tiie Red In
dian looked at the scoreboard, and
didn't like what he saw.
Gary Kerkorian, who completed
five out of his hist live passes, re
covered a WSC fumble 011 the Card
41, and the Indians were off. McColl,
who set a new PCC record in pass
receiving, acccpted a Kerkorian
bullet 011 the opponent 44. Ker
korian then handed to Bobby White,
who raced straight up the middle
for the whole distance.
Stanford held the Cougars and then
look over on tn u' own 44. Benson,
end Bob Scott, and then McColl took
the ball to the !) where it was fourth
down and three yards to go. It was a


RAZZLE DAZZLE AT ITS BEST—Boyd Benson, Stan
ford's yardage gobbling right half, is shown putting
on the finishing touches of a much-talked-about 58-
yard scoring play. Kerkorian passed 33 yards to

McColl, who faked a lateral, ran, and then lateraled
to Benson. Benson ran to the right sideline, then cut
to his left, and scampered straight up the middle for
the score, leaving a wake of befuddled Cougar de-

fenders. This picture, which reveals 17 of the 22
players, shows Indians McColl (3), Bob Scott (23),
Bob Meyers (19), and Dick Gaedtke (29).
