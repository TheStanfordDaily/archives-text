# Dr. Goheen to Discuss William James Tonight
## 
### 
The Philosophy Department's new
i chairman, Dr. John D. Gohccn, who
i began his Stanford career I wo
: months ago, will Iccturc tonight at
j 7:?>0 in Memorial Hall on another
! Stanford philosopher, who left in
' 1006 when an earthquake made the
j campus look like an overturned
! wastebasket.
This brief period in the lifr» of
Pragmatist philosopher and scien
tist William James and the relation
between his personality and his
work is tho topic of Dr. Goheen's
talk, a feature of the regular Tucs
| day Evening Scries.
Tokyo Seminar
"My first job with Stanford took
! place in Japan last summer," Dr.
Goheen recalled, before he had even
taught a class here. He was one of
the five Farm professors chosen to
conduct seminars in the Orient, a
project sponsored by Stanford and
the Tokyo National University un
der a grant from the Rockefeller
Foundation.
"I gave several lectures over
there in which James figured prom
inently," Dr. Gohccn .said, but he
has never altogether specialized in
j "the most striking and controversial
figure in the history of Pragma
| tism."
Experiment
Pragmatism under the influence

of James and later under John
Dewey led to the development of
the experimental approach in pro
gressive education, morality, and
religion. "These derivatives of
James's work arc currently under
1 attack by the more dogmatic points
j of view," he remarked.
' Pragmatism attracted many bril
liant persons who gave the move
ment vitality and strength," he said,
adding that this characteristic was
due in a large degree to James
himself.
Brothers Contrast
The contrast between William
James (who rjied in 1010) and his
long - sentenced novelist brother
Ilenry was great. They held in com
mon, according to tonight's speaker,
only "an extraordinarily keen sen
sitivity to the whole range of hu
-1 man experience."
Dr. Goheen hopes some day to
finish two "continuing" works of
his own. Already nearing comple
tion is a book on "The Development
of Western Philosophy." A second
book is tentatively entitled "A
Critical Study of the Philosophy of
Aristotle."
Swamped with the unfamiliar du
ties of his new job. Dr. Gohccn is
worried about his two infant works.
"They may not even sec the light
i of day,"he explained cautiously.

Brothers Contrast
The contrast between William
James (who rjied in 1010) and his
long - sentenced novelist brother

Tokyo Seminar
"My first job with Stanford took
! place in Japan last summer," Dr.
Goheen recalled, before he had even
taught a class here. He was one of
the five Farm professors chosen to
conduct seminars in the Orient, a
project sponsored by Stanford and
the Tokyo National University un
der a grant from the Rockefeller
Foundation.

Pragmatism under the influence

of James and later under John
Dewey led to the development of
the experimental approach in pro
gressive education, morality, and
religion. "These derivatives of
James's work arc currently under
