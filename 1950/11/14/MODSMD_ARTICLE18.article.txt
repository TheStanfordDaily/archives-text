# WELFARE DRIVE
## Comic Tags Sell Today 
### 
Autumn quarter's four -in - one
charity drive goes into its second
day today as some two dozen wom
en will be selling dime tags at the
History and Engineering corners
and at the Cellar from 8 a.m. to
noon.
"I gave, so leave me alone!" will
be inscribed on the paper tags, as
Cardinals, sponsors of the welfare
campaign, continue to emphasize
the fact that this will be the only
campus solicitation of the quarter.
At the same time, solicitors are
still canvassing each campus living
group, and will continue to do so
through the week. Off-campus stu
dents will have their opportunity to
contribute to the drive at booths to
be set up by the "Y"' on Quad to
morrow. The campaign's quota has
been set at $4,500.
Four Charities
Four charities will divide the
proceeds: the American Cancer So
riety. the Palo Alto-Stanford Youth
Fund, Foreign Relief, and the Stan
ford Floating Fund.
Tlw? foreign relief share will go to
the Stanford Internatioanl Relief
Organization for continuance of its
sending of material supplies to stu
dents throughout the world.
SIROf a branch of lIR. is present
ly considering affiliation with a uni
versity abroad for the coming year,
according to Pat Terry, SIRO offi
cer. The lIR has contacted various
organizations, such as the World
Student Service Fund and UNES
CO, asking for lists of various for
eign universities in need of assist
ance.
Aid to University
The lIR may then choose a uni
versity and either send it money or
such material relief as books and
clotihng. Such an association be
tween Stanford and a foreign school
could lead to an exchange of stu
dents between the two universities,
Miss Terry said.
In addition to this possibility,
SIRO will continue its aid program
to the schools it has already assist
ed, such as the Free University of
Berlin, with the money it receives
from this week's drive.
