LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y.. Nov. 13
(UP) â€”The United Nations today
received an impassioned appeal
from the Himalayan kingdom of ;
Tibet to save it from conquest by
j the Chinese Communists.
The 1,500-ward appeal said. "Ti- j
j bet will not go down without a
j fight, though there is little hope of
' a nation dedicated to peace resist- I
ing the brutal effort of men trained j
j to war."
Then it added in a tone of des
| perate hope:
' "But we understand the United
Nations have decided to stop ag- J
I gression wherever it takes place." j
The message said the 16-year-old
Dalai Lama had approved the move
j to "entrust the problem of Tibet in
I this emergency to the ultimate de
cision of the UN." It was signed by
the Kashag (the Tibetan cabinet)
i and the National Assembly of Tibet.
There is no sign here yet that j
any UN member will call for action
on the Tibetan appeal, (hough Na
j tionalist China was reported con- !
| sidering such a move.
