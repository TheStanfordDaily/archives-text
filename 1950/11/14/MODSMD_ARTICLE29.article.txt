# Scratchin's From the Editor's Pen

About tfiis time of year, we start missing that
Stanford bible- the "Bawlout." It is interesting
to dream of what might happen if and when the
students get their copies of the directory of stu
dents.
The men would at last discover where their
"flames" of last year are now living. Men and
women could look at their dates' grade aver
ages of last year and predict the kind of date
they'll have this weekend. Unknown changes
in marital status would become apparent along
with new academic interests.
It lias always seemed to us that if a news
paper can get out on time under pressure, the
Registrar's office ought to be able to publish the
bawlout early in fall quarter.
Last year's bawlout circulation date, Nov. 22,
seerns about three weeks later than necessary,
but it appears thai this year's Bawlout will fol
low the precedent of past editions. By next
week we may have a guide to the who, what,
end why of the Stanford family.

V/e have been wondering for several years
why the band stunts periorrned at the halftime

were not described on the public Address Sys
tem. Athletic News Director Don Liebendorfer
told us the spectators appreciate relief from the
blaring loud speaker.
Few people have indicaied to him that they
favor such a plan, and apparently until they do,
there will be no commentary.
The use of the loud speaker in the Coliseum
and at the University of Washington adds con
siderably to the success of the band formations
we feel. What do the students think?

The Little Injun still has the victory magic in
his plastic face. But we won't be satisfied until
he is waving the real Axe not a cardboard sub
stitute.
The "cleanup campaign" of the Union Board
of Governors in today's Campus Opinion is a
cause which every student should take to heart.
Probably the problem is one which could be ap
plied to other spots on campus.
Scraps of paper, wind-blown copies of the
Daily, and cigarette stubs are conspicuous eye
sores and certainly result in extra janitorial ex
pense.
