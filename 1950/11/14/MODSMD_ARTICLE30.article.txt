# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
I see where Army has had scouts at every one of
Stanford's last lour games. ... I wondered who those
two Hiiys were, playing cribbage up in the press box
• very Saturday. I'm glad to hear they were there
though. It .should make our strategy a complete i>uc-

eess ... or didn't you know that
the whole point of Stanford's last
lour games was to make Army
overconfident? I don't know if
they are overconfident or not, but
1 hear Blaik is planning to use
hi.v wife at quarterback instead of
his son.
But I've got scouts, too, and
they tell me the West Pointers are

undergoing elaborate preparations for this weekend.
Every night in fact Blaik gets his team together and
runs movies of the Indians . . . Red River, Drums
Along the Mohawk, The Plainsman. I guess it's all
part of a psychological buildup . . . can't you see
some Army back plunging across the Stanford goal
line shouting: "This one's for Custer"
But there's hope for the Big Red yet. According to
my reports all this stuff you hear about life at the
Point being so tough for football players is true . . .
what with the constant round of parades, formal dress
ball.'., saber drills, salutes . . . they're just liable to be
all tuckered out by the time they get here. Ju: ; t to
prove it, here's a breakdown on a typical day in the
life of an Army football player.
10:30 a.m.—lCeveille (that brisk early morning air
is good for the lungs)

11 a.m.—Breakfast (served in bed by two plebes)
11:45a.m.—Class (having been dressed first, of
course, by three plebes)
12—Lunch (served on a terrace overlooking the
Hudson by four plebes)
1 p.m.—Class (unless there's a game the following
Saturday in which case the player can take a nap if
he seifds five plebes in his place)
1:05 to 8 p.m.—Football Practice
8:30 p.m.—Dinner (served on the Hudson over
looking a Terrace by six plebes)
9 p.m.—Taps (blown ever so softly so as not to
wake any of the poor babies who have dropped off
earlier)
Yeah, it's rough for ballplayers at the Point, but you
have to hand it to them . . . they know how to play
football. You can always look in the paper Sunday
morning and tell who played Army the day before by
the statistics . . . for most teams it reads AYG (aver
age yards gained), YGP (yards gained passing), and
YGR (yards gained rushing) ... if the team played
Army they have K (killed), W (wounded), and MIA
(missing in action).
I remember during the war, our high school locker
room had a big poster plastered over the door, with
a group of youngsters playing football and these words
. . . "Upon these fields of friendly strife are sown the
seeds, that in other times, on other fields, will bear the
112 ruits of victory."
Know who wrote that? General Mac Arthur, one
time superintendent of West Point. This Saturday
we ll see how ripe those fruits are.

have to hand it to them . . . they know how to play
football. You can always look in the paper Sunday
morning and tell who played Army the day before by
the statistics . . . for most teams it reads AYG (aver
age yards gained), YGP (yards gained passing), and
YGR (yards gained rushing) ... if the team played
Army they have K (killed), W (wounded), and MIA
(missing in action).
I remember during the war, our high school locker
room had a big poster plastered over the door, with
a group of youngsters playing football and these words
. . . "Upon these fields of friendly strife are sown the
seeds, that in other times, on other fields, will bear the
112 ruits of victory."
Know who wrote that? General Mac Arthur, one
time superintendent of West Point. This Saturday
we ll see how ripe those fruits are.

I see where Army has had scouts at every one of
Stanford's last lour games. ... I wondered who those
two Hiiys were, playing cribbage up in the press box
• very Saturday. I'm glad to hear they were there
though. It .should make our strategy a complete i>uc-

eess ... or didn't you know that
the whole point of Stanford's last
lour games was to make Army
overconfident? I don't know if
they are overconfident or not, but
1 hear Blaik is planning to use
hi.v wife at quarterback instead of
his son.
But I've got scouts, too, and
they tell me the West Pointers are

undergoing elaborate preparations for this weekend.
Every night in fact Blaik gets his team together and
runs movies of the Indians . . . Red River, Drums
Along the Mohawk, The Plainsman. I guess it's all
part of a psychological buildup . . . can't you see
some Army back plunging across the Stanford goal
line shouting: "This one's for Custer"
But there's hope for the Big Red yet. According to
my reports all this stuff you hear about life at the
Point being so tough for football players is true . . .
what with the constant round of parades, formal dress
ball.'., saber drills, salutes . . . they're just liable to be
all tuckered out by the time they get here. Ju: ; t to
prove it, here's a breakdown on a typical day in the
life of an Army football player.
10:30 a.m.—lCeveille (that brisk early morning air
is good for the lungs)

11 a.m.—Breakfast (served in bed by two plebes)
11:45a.m.—Class (having been dressed first, of
course, by three plebes)
12—Lunch (served on a terrace overlooking the
Hudson by four plebes)
1 p.m.—Class (unless there's a game the following
Saturday in which case the player can take a nap if
he seifds five plebes in his place)
1:05 to 8 p.m.—Football Practice
8:30 p.m.—Dinner (served on the Hudson over
looking a Terrace by six plebes)
9 p.m.—Taps (blown ever so softly so as not to
wake any of the poor babies who have dropped off
earlier)
