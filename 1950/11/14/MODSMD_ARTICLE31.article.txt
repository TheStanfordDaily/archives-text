To the Editor:
The inescapable conclusion from the published re
-1 oris of Excom's action on an expression of opinion on
loyalty oaths and academic freedom is that they do
not want to take a stand on a controversial issue, or
allow the student body to do so by democratic means.
Such an attitude can easily lead to the evaporation of
the very freedom for which this country stands. It is
our ('uty as citizens to form opinions on fundamental
ivut .• aiid express them so they may be heard.
If we are afraid to take a definite stand on a vital
i ut- concerning the principles of democracy, merely
I ♦ < au:.e someone might call us a nasty name (perhaps
"Communist '), we are asking every demagogue to
stand up and tell us how to think and act. This is a
much easier way to lose freedom than by external
< onquest.
It we as students do not recognize academic freedom
as essential to democracy, who will? Oaths are a tactic.
The tratepy is encompassment of academic freedom,
l erhaps this is necessary. But we, students, who have
a responsibility to tomorrow as well as today, should
l.av j chance to express ourselves us a group on an
i'. u< that so vitally affects our future as a group.
II Fxcom wantecf an expression of opinion it could

opinion. Apparently they do not want it. I do.

To the Editor:
Yuu don't notice the difference that picking up your ]
room as you go along makes until you let it go for a
lew days. If the janitorial service at the Cellar and
around the snack bar were to be stopped even for a |
few hours, a difference certainly would be apparent.
If you had to pay someone 75 cents an hour to pick
up your room ( very day, you might soon develop the i
habit of neatness and save the money. At the present !
time ASSU i: paying 75 cents or more an hour to two ;
porters for eight hours a day, two students for at least
an hour a day, and janitors for spot clean-ups as well j
as regular service at night and early in the morning.
Some of this is the routine cleaning of garbage cans
and general sweeping out, but so much of it is picking
up those coffee cups that didn't make the "cauldron"
and undoing the handiwork of "paper pitchers."
II only two hours could be cut from the clean-up
time each day, we could save at least $10 a week or
more th&n $100 a quarter. This is the kind of needless
expense resulting from carelessness that could lead to
a rise in the tuition. It might even persuade the Cel
lar to make that 5 cent cup of coffee a dime!

Yuu don't notice the difference that picking up your ]
room as you go along makes until you let it go for a
lew days. If the janitorial service at the Cellar and
around the snack bar were to be stopped even for a |
few hours, a difference certainly would be apparent.
If you had to pay someone 75 cents an hour to pick
up your room ( very day, you might soon develop the i
habit of neatness and save the money. At the present !
time ASSU i: paying 75 cents or more an hour to two ;
porters for eight hours a day, two students for at least
an hour a day, and janitors for spot clean-ups as well j
as regular service at night and early in the morning.
Some of this is the routine cleaning of garbage cans
and general sweeping out, but so much of it is picking
up those coffee cups that didn't make the "cauldron"
and undoing the handiwork of "paper pitchers."
II only two hours could be cut from the clean-up
time each day, we could save at least $10 a week or
more th&n $100 a quarter. This is the kind of needless
expense resulting from carelessness that could lead to
a rise in the tuition. It might even persuade the Cel
lar to make that 5 cent cup of coffee a dime!

To the Editor:
The inescapable conclusion from the published re
-1 oris of Excom's action on an expression of opinion on
loyalty oaths and academic freedom is that they do
not want to take a stand on a controversial issue, or
allow the student body to do so by democratic means.
Such an attitude can easily lead to the evaporation of
the very freedom for which this country stands. It is
our ('uty as citizens to form opinions on fundamental
ivut .• aiid express them so they may be heard.
If we are afraid to take a definite stand on a vital
i ut- concerning the principles of democracy, merely
I ♦ < au:.e someone might call us a nasty name (perhaps
"Communist '), we are asking every demagogue to
stand up and tell us how to think and act. This is a
much easier way to lose freedom than by external
< onquest.
It we as students do not recognize academic freedom
as essential to democracy, who will? Oaths are a tactic.
The tratepy is encompassment of academic freedom,
l erhaps this is necessary. But we, students, who have
a responsibility to tomorrow as well as today, should
l.av j chance to express ourselves us a group on an
i'. u< that so vitally affects our future as a group.
