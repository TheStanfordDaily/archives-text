DECOYSâ€”Bobby White, Cardinal halfback, completed a 24-yard touchdown play as ends Bruce
Van Alstyne and Bill McColl drew Washington State defenders their way. On this particular
play, Gary Kerkorian found White standing by himself on the 17 and hit him with a short lob.
White trotted over untouched. This photo was taken by Daily photographer Jerry Schwab, who
took yesterday's front-page football shot from the roof of the Stadium.
