# Cadets Invade Farm; Seek to Even Series
## Stanford Out to Stop Win Streak Of Big, Bad, Black Knights at 27 
### LARRY CAHN 
It could be the 1950 version of the Last of the Mohicans when the
big, bad, Black Knights of the Hudson march on the Farm Indians
Saturday.
The Cadets will be seeking their twenty-eighth consecutive vic
tory at the hands of a Cardinal team boasting, not too proudly, a

five-win, two-loss, one-tie seasonal
record.
Army will bring a form of rock and
sock football that Farm eyes haven't
seen, praise the Lord, since Michifan
manhandled the locals last year, 27
to 7.
Saturday the Academy has a score
to settle with Stanford. That is, in
three .previous meetings the Injuns
have made the Pointers surrender
twice. Bat that was way back in '28
and '29. Incidentally, Army's colors
are grey, gold, black, and blue. The
latter two shades perhaps are an
omen. Oh well, forward march!
It was on a cold November day in
1948 that the Big Red Machine rolled
into New York to play the rampaging
Cadets. A crowd of 53.000 ventured
to Yankee Stadium to see the "sched
ule replacement" for Notre Dame.
Not a good substitute for the Irish,
but a good breather for Army, was
Stanford that afternoon. The Indians
were buried, 43 to 0.
The Cadets paraded the length of
the field to score after eight minutes
of play. On the succeeding kickoff,
Card fullback Emery Mitchell was
taken from the field with torn knee
ligaments. With him went the heart
of the Cardinal attack and defense,
but not the will to win.
Led by quarterbacks Don Camp
bell, Tom Shaw, and Aubrey Devine,
the Cards put together drives, but
they all ran out of gas near pay dirt.
Army with a brilliant running
game and an aerial display put on
by Arnold Galiffa, just had too much
lor Stanford. Breakaway runs by
Oil Stephenson, Jack Stuart, and

Rudy Costenino, pius Army's platoon
system of play drove the Indians into
submission.
Stanford actually had 12 first downs
to the Cadets' 11, but in yards gained
it was Army G95, Stanford 15G.
Getting to more pleasant games, we
turn back to 1928 and '29. Stanford
won both of these, 34 to 14 and 28
to 6, respectively.
In 1928 under Pop Warner the In
dians traveled to New York City and
shocked the East by trimming the Ca
dets 34 to 14. In a return battle in
'29 the Pointers led by AIl-American
Chris Cagle, were buried in Stanford
Stadium turf, 28 to 6. Cagle was com
pletely bottled up and with him went
the Army offense.
Warner's razzle-dazzle teams of
those two years, which were na
tionally renowned, were sparked by
Lud Frentrup, Eli Post, All-American
guard, Walter Heineike, center, and
halfback Herb Fleishhacker, who all
played a large part in Stanford's
dumping of Army.
Saturday Army will be venturing
to the Coast for the first time since
1929. The large earthen Stanford
Bowl should be bulging at its seams
when the power of the East and the
nation meets the ???? of the West.
