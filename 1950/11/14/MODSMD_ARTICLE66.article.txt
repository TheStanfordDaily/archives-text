## 
### 
So you think there have been
; surprises in the football world this
year? Wait till you sec the No
vember Chaparral. Rumor has it
that the Chappies' football issue,
due to hit the campus tomorrow,
' will he the greatest shock in an up
: set-ful season.
Anyway, the issue will include
some research work on Rally Com,
!an account of a Black Friday in
college football, and Chappie's
choices for this year's All-Ameri
! cans.
All this and a multitude of yuks,
cartoons, and laffs tooâ€”all for 30
cents on the open market. The open
market will consist, as usual, of
, stands on the four corners of Quad,
the Cellar, and the Post Office.
