# Spaeth Describes Position of India
## 
### 
"The Indian people fear and
will resist every action which, in :
using them to promote Western
ands, operates to restore the
power and domination from
which they have so recently
been liberated."
With these words, Dean Carl B. !
Spaeth of the Law School, explained J
India's neutral position in world af- |
fairs last night at a public Stanford
Law Forum meeting in Cubberley
Auditorium.
"If the Western people under
stand our position," said Spaeth
speaking as if he were an Indian
official, "they will also begin to !
understand our determination not
to be used as means or tools for the 1
West in its struggle against the |
Soviet Union."
At the forum meeting, Spaeth re- i
ported on the recent Institute of Pa
cific Relations Conference at Luck- j
now, India, which he attended. "At ;
the conference, free of protocol and
the limitations that often compel re- j
serve by government spokesmen," the i
Dean pointed out, "there was a full j
and healthy exchange of views."
In bis talk. Dean Spaeth gave the
essence of the Inrlian and Eastern
position as he understood it at
Lurk now, his analysis of that posi- !
(ion. and his suggestions for the
lines of policy the United States
should follow.
Analyzing India's stand of neu
trality today, lie mentioned that "it
was only a little more than 10 years
ago that we were the great leaders ]
of a neutral bloc ourselves."
"And it should not be surprising,"
he explained that in 1949-50 Indians ]
are reluctant to join an alliance |
which includes nations from which J
Eastern independence has been so j
recently won."
The major tasks of the United
States today, urged Spaeth, are
military preparedness and the con
tinuation of our battle on the ceo
nomic front, including the Marshall
Plan and Point IV Program.
