# Coed Caller Ruling May Be Altered
## 
### 
Writing of a tentative rule to rc- |
place the women's social regulation [
on women visiting men's residences ;
was continued yesterday by the |
Fundamental Standard Committee. !
The rule which the committee
j recommends he changed reads:
"It is not considered acceptable
under the Fundamental Standard
J for a woman to he in a man's resi-
I dence, fraternity, or apartment, on i
or off campus, save in the company
of at least one other woman."
Strengthen trr Repeal
The committee decided earlier
this month that the rule was weak
I and should cither be strengthened i
j or repealed. A definite need for the j
| rule was seen, so the group is now j
writing a rule which it will propose
| as a substitute for the present one.
AWS yesterday considered the
Fundamental Standard Committee's
i proposed case for and against the
j rule as it now stands.
Nuisance Value
Nuisance value was the rule's
main weakness, the committee de
! cided. For example, it requires a
j gii* to wait outside while her es
cort goes into his rsidence for a
coat. Again, a girl may not enter a
man's residence alone to perform a
I simple errand like putting up a
poster.
It was also suggested that the vio
j lations the rule is designed to pre
! vent are already covered by the
j Fundamental Standard.
