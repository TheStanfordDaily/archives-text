Dr. John D. Goheen, recently ap
pointed head of Stanford's Philoso
phy Department, lectured on "Wil
liam James and His Philosophy of
Pragmatism" last night in Memorial
Hall.
One of the highlights of Dr. Go
heen's appraisal of the man came
when he quoted an astute if amus
ing description of Stanford Univer
sity contained in a letter James
wrote to a famous French philoso-

plicr. The letter was dated Fcbvu- 1
ary 0, 1906, at which time James !
was serving on the Stanford faculty, j
". . . you ought to see this extra- ,
ordinary little University. It was
founded only fourteen years ago in j
absolute wilderness, by a pair of |
rich Californians. . . (It is) endowed
j with I know not how many square
miles of land, which some day will i
come into the market and yield a
big income. . . .
"The whole thing might be Uto- '
pian; it is only half-Utopian. . . .
But the half success is great enough
to make one sec the great advan
tages that come to this country from
encouraging public - spirited mil
lionaires to indulge their freaks,
however eccentric.
"In what the Stanfords have al
ready done, there is an assured po
• tentiality of great things of some
; sort for all future time."
In discussing the philosophy of
■ Pragmatism, Gohecn said it was not
i a new philosophy, but rather "a
new emphasis on orientation of out
look. James tried to design a phi
losophy which would fit common
sense and common experience."
