A proposed ASSU constitutional |
amendment to correct the difficul
ties met by anti-loyalty oath reso
lution proponents at Excom has
been submitted to the University
president's office for approval.
At the same time a group of "in
terested students," authors of the
amendment, met to seek a charter
from Excom for a poll committee to
co-operate with the Debate Soci
ety and the Forum Committee in
sounding out student opinion.
These two actions were the latest
outcome of a student move to have
the Associated Students pass a reso
lution condemning anti-Communis
tic loyalty oaths.
The amendment would permit
the students, as members of the
ASSU, to adopt statements ex
pressing student opinion. It would
also require that Excom submit to
a student election any statement
of student opinion contained in a
petition bearing names of 10 per
cent of the student body.
The amendment has been ap
proved in form by the Political Sci
ence Department and the Law
School, according to Tom Lupher,
spokesman for the group. It must
be approved in content by the
Board of Trustees, which meets to
morrow. •
As an alternative to the amend
ment, should it be vetoed by the
Board of Trustees, Excom will be
asked to charter the poll committee.
The Board of Trustees must ap
prove all amendments to the ASSU
constitution because this constitu
tion must conform to the deed of
trust under which Stanford is run
as a University.
Excom recently turned down a
request, to submit the issue to a
student vote on the grounds that,
under the ASSU constitution, such
j action was not within the scope of
the Associated Students.
The amendment reads:
"111, 1, h. Limitations — The
members of the Association have
the power to adopt statements ex
pressing student opinion, subject
to the provisions of this constitu
tion and the regulations of the
University.
"VIII. Expression of student
opinion — Any proposal for a
statement expressing student
opinion may be presented to the
Executive Committee by the peti
tion of 10 per cent of the members
of the Association, filed in the As
sociation office. The Executive
Committee shall submit the state
ment in proper form to a vote of
the members of the Association.
Such election, shall be held at such
time and under such regulations
as are provided in this article for
j election on petition to amend the
| by-laws.
"The statement shall be adopt
i ed if it receives the majority of
the vote east at such election."

constitution because this constitu
tion must conform to the deed of
trust under which Stanford is run
as a University.
Excom recently turned down a
request, to submit the issue to a
student vote on the grounds that,
under the ASSU constitution, such
j action was not within the scope of
the Associated Students.
The amendment reads:
"111, 1, h. Limitations — The
members of the Association have
the power to adopt statements ex
pressing student opinion, subject
to the provisions of this constitu
tion and the regulations of the
University.
"VIII. Expression of student
opinion — Any proposal for a
statement expressing student
opinion may be presented to the
Executive Committee by the peti
tion of 10 per cent of the members
of the Association, filed in the As
sociation office. The Executive
Committee shall submit the state
ment in proper form to a vote of
the members of the Association.
Such election, shall be held at such
time and under such regulations
as are provided in this article for
j election on petition to amend the
| by-laws.
"The statement shall be adopt
i ed if it receives the majority of
the vote east at such election."
A proposed ASSU constitutional |
amendment to correct the difficul
ties met by anti-loyalty oath reso
lution proponents at Excom has
been submitted to the University
president's office for approval.
At the same time a group of "in
terested students," authors of the
amendment, met to seek a charter
from Excom for a poll committee to
co-operate with the Debate Soci
ety and the Forum Committee in
sounding out student opinion.
These two actions were the latest
outcome of a student move to have
the Associated Students pass a reso
lution condemning anti-Communis
tic loyalty oaths.
The amendment would permit
the students, as members of the
ASSU, to adopt statements ex
pressing student opinion. It would
also require that Excom submit to
a student election any statement
of student opinion contained in a
petition bearing names of 10 per
cent of the student body.
The amendment has been ap
proved in form by the Political Sci
ence Department and the Law
School, according to Tom Lupher,
spokesman for the group. It must
be approved in content by the
Board of Trustees, which meets to
morrow. •
As an alternative to the amend
ment, should it be vetoed by the
Board of Trustees, Excom will be
asked to charter the poll committee.
The Board of Trustees must ap
prove all amendments to the ASSU
constitution because this constitu
tion must conform to the deed of
trust under which Stanford is run
as a University.
