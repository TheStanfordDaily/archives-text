# Your Money—And Your Vote
## 
### 
We've said it belore, and we'll say it again:
GET OUT AND VOTE!
Last week, at the primaries, the student body
made one of its poorest showings in many a
year. Twenty-one per cent of over 8,000 eli
gible voters showed up at the polls to cast their
ballots for nine student government offices.
Four of those offices were elected finally; for
lack of a majority, the remaining five will be
contested today. They are freshman class presi
dent, secretary-treasurer, and excom represen
tative, senior class excom representative, and
member of Men's Council.
Why is it important that you vote? There are
a lot of reasons, and not all of them can be right
fully explained by the simple, over-used
phrase, "your most treasured privilege—the
right to vote."
At Stanford, right now, at least 55,400 over
flows the coffers of the sophomore, junior, and
senior classes. Still to be collected from the
freshman are class dues, which will probably
raise the total at least another three to four
thousand dollars.
But that's not even half the financial picture.
Another $34,000 constitutes the expected '50 -
'51 income of the ASSU. Every penny of that

money, including the thousands of dollars in
the class treasuries, is administered by Excom
and class officers who are elected by you, the
students.
As a matter of fact, you the students are the
ones that give the money in the first place.
Frosh dues may go as high as $5 per man this
year, while every student pays 51.25 of his
tuition money every guarter to support the
ASSU.
In part, then, the act of voting boils down to
the guestion of just where you want your
money to go. What kind of dances and rallies
do you want, what kind of foreign scholarship
program suits you best, what do you think
should be emphasized during Big Game week,
during half-time at Saturday's football games?
We could go on almost indefinitely—and still
we would be covering only one of the functions
of student government: the spending of the Al
mighty Dollar.
Through the people you elect to office today
are transferred your ideas about student gov
ernment. Let those of you who think "student
government is a farce," or "forget" to vote, or
"are too busy" to vote, take a second look at
what the "voting franchise" actually means.
