# BULL SESSION

### AL BERRY 
liave you ever been chained to the revolving door
ol the St. Francis Hotel?
In posing the above question, we again set iorth on
another stirring chapter in the Adventures ol' A 1
Berry, hoy Prince Valiant. Well, it started out thy;

way. I was kinda minding my own
business Monday afternoon and
had, in a sudden unexplainable
burst oi' energy, started off toward
my 1 o'clock. I was accompanied
Ly a pledge in the organization
which boards and feeds me, whose
name is now Mud.
Well, Mud and I had just gotten
to the BAC where the class was

wlien I was surnounded by pledges—all of whom are
now named Mud. It immediately became apparent
that our usually submissive house Loys had gotten
completely out of hand.
1 was never really worried—l knew the tremendous
respect (almost akin to fear) that these people felt
for my person, so I, in a charming intimate manner,
impressed upon them the consequences that would
certainly follow if they attempted to go through with
their dastardly act. They trembled in fright and shame
before my overpowering personality.
Ninety-two seconds later, I was firmly trussed in
about 20 ieet ol boat-docking hawser (rope, to you)
and we were on our way to parts and places unknown.
With someone's slightly used sweatshirt pasted around
my overpowering stare, the rope wrapped around and
around my copious body, I felt like the Normandie
docking in the fog in Harlem. Anil I'm told that there
was some little resemblance.
The other abductees on this little jaunt were Terry
mouse, Reidbombabe, and an unidentified brother
njMied Stork. The kids were occasionally unkind to
Reidbombabe and Stork because they insisted on
answering all questions with short, unpleasant, and
wholly accurate Anglo-Saxon words—the definitions
of which have an interesting but totally unprintable
connotation.

Terrymouse was in the other car, l.ut I managed to
keep up a show for these lowly creatures who dared
to attack a noble and worthy (no Letters to the Editor,
please) active. With a firm set of my jaw, and a snarl
on my face, I listened to their puny threats, inter
rupting occasionally with a soft-spoken "Our Father
who art in . . ~" and "Help" or "Mother," and a few
other well chosen and witty words.
Upon reaching the city, laughingly known as Bag
dad on the Bay Rum, we went to the Shadows, where
the pledges—finally realizing that they would have to
come home sometime—treated the four of us to din
ner, and a small drink before. Terrymouse and I sat
together at dinner and immediately went for that big
steak, informing the waiter that we wanted the gour
met size and that price was no object. The dollar-shy
pledges blanched, but were brave.
Then the Terrymouse ordered a large bottle of
claret with two glasses for he and I. Mud, the pledge
class president, changed his order to a light salad.
They drew the line when we asked for a special order
of crepes-suzette for dessert, but on the whole it was
a good meal.
Then the pledges paid for it and the four actives paid
for the pledges paying for it.
With hands chained and padlocked behind us and
the same uncouth treatment being extended to our
feet, we arrived and were duly padlocked to the re
volving door of the Post street entrance of the St.
Francis. Ah. this gay, collegiate life.
An hour later, with the help of the house detective,
the hotel engineer, the hotel electrician, and three
hacksaws, were were free. The brothers (who are also
named Mud) finally came up and drove us home, com
plaining all the way that we had interrupted a party
they were having with the gurls from Madrono.
"Here we bring the girls all the way up here to see
you chained," said Mac—er Mud—and you have to go
and get loose." Stork and and Reidbombabe started
thinking Anglo-Saxon words again, but we dropped
the girls before they used them.
