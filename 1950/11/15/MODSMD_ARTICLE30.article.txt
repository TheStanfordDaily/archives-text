# CAMPUS OPINION
## Belated Additions to Coach Problem 
### 
To the Editor:
Alter reading Campus Opinion today I am convinced
that Stanford has failed somewhere along the line. If
Stanford Alumni are willing to contribute to the Stan
lord Fund only when we have a winning football team,
then our students and alumni must have a mistaken
idea of the reasons for the existence of a university.
11 football is going to become so important that we
are not able to receive help when we have an average
team then it might be better to have Stanford fulfill
only ihe functions of a University and not take on
the:-e side activities. The University of Chicago has
not damaged its reputation as a university by giving up
football. If we, as students and alumni (I am both),
have laileil to see that our help is needed at Stanford
in many ways other than football, and if it is this
major emphasis on football that has caused our true
floats to be obscured, then let us eliminate this minor
side issue.
1 personally hope it is only an unimportant few who
have spent four years at Stanford and not seen our
ti ue fcoals. I hope we can still have a competent team
and an excellent University but if u choice must be
made then I vote foi the excellent University.
