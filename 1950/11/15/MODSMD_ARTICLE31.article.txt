To the Editor:
I hi:, is a delayed reaction to A 1 Berry's column of
Nov. h, in which Berry attacked the student Ixjdy for
certain actions:
Berry leads us to believe it is subversive and un-
Starifordian to oppose the reemployment of Schwartz.
II this is so, what are we who sincerely believe that
Schwartz is a poor coach—albeit a gentleman and mag
nificent public relations specialist —to do?
Are we branded "poor losers," "bleacher coaches,"
"the underhanded anti-Schwartz element," and "Cal
hke rabble" simply because we differ in our opinions?
Need we incur the vilification of Berry and others,
because we dure to disagree with them? Is slander
and ridicule the penalty we must pay for expressing
an honest opinion?
II is intimated that we wish to have Schwartz re
moved lor personal reasons; that we care little or
nothing about Stanford; that we are merely "agin" the
coach. 'Ibis, of course, is nonsense.
And. Mr. Berry, I don't think the "selfish minority"
i> planning on bombing thp BAC forget the shelter
in the Quad.
