To the Editor:
In Maggie Bernt's saccharine review of the Stanford
Players' recent production of "Julius Caesar," she
frowned understandably at the balcony section of
"giggly high school students" who, by their laughter,
disrupted several serious scenes on opening night.
While one cannot help but ieer annoyed along with
Miss Bernt at the ebullient playgoers, it occurs to one
that instead of spending two precious paragraphs chas
tising the audience, your reviewer would have done
better to analyze the cause of the mirth.
The role of Caesar doc.* not provoke mirth unless
it is so directed. By allowing John Brehncr to appear
as a neurotic, spasmic, petty Caesar, Director A.
Nicholas Vardac left little of the needed dignity in
this character, and Caesar fell ready prey to the
laughter of the more untrained members of the audi
ence.
Nor was a similar quality of vulgarity missing in
other aspects of the production. The octoputic em
brace of B >tus and Portia, for one thing, was dramati
cally most improbable, and seemed more the product
of a Hollywood sound stage than an advanced univer
sity theater.
The acting was kept too regularly at a biceps and
bravado pitch; Brutus was portrayed as less ideal
istic than naive; the steep-pitched set obtruded art
lessly by causing real apprehension in the audience
for the safety of the actors; action too often shifted to
center stage; and the costumes, notably the football
pants-type uniform of some soldiers, and all of the
helmets, were painfully self-conscious.
Granted that both space and time conspire against
the Stanford Daily drama reviewer, is it still necessary
for her to observe campus productions through Polly
anna lenses? Must Daily reviews be limited to mere
listing of names, with blurred adjectives interspersed?
(What, for example, is "lull" acting?) Our Speech and
Drama Department has an ambitious schedule this
year and promising personnel; they de.erve to have
their back scratched when they do well, but they al:;o
need to be told when they could have done better.
Your headline proclaimed that "Julius Caesar" was a
"top crowd pleaser," whereas there were at least three
in that crowd who felt that Shakespeare's "Caesar"
was produced more as if il were "Tarzan of the Apes."
