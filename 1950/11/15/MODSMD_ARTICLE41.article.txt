### SHIRLEY ELLSWORTH 
"Domestic Art in Mass Production" is the title of the new show
at the Stanford Art Gallery. The display includes articles of furni
ture and various utensils and household accessories indicative of
the modern trend in art. The id'ea of the exhibit is to show that
utility, originality, and attractiveness need not be sacrificed by
mass production techniques.

Lithographs by Jean Chariot com- j
pltte the show. His pictures concern
Hawaiian, natives.
In the domestic art exhibit there is
a variety of chairs and stools, some
of which are immediately recognized I
as objects on which to sit, some of '
which are not. Interesting materials
and utilitarian features of strength |
and lightness combine to achieve un
usual effects. The tables also are light
ind mobile.
Shows Adjustable Lamps
The lamps, whether wall fixtures
or floor or table lamps, have simple
lines and plain colors. The floor lamp
is adjustable to accommodate either
direct or indirect lighting.
Decorative wooden floor screens
are either solid colors or natural
! wood with a thread of color running
through them to form a pattern.
1 These screens serve to set off articles
of furniture dramatically.
The samples of wall paper are ab
| stract and combine color with un
usual shapes. Drape textiles are like—
! wise splashed with color. Whereas
the furnishings are basically in plain
' subdued colors, the wall paper and
| textiles alone provide the real color
t accents.
Knohs Tell The Time
The most unusual modern clock on
display has no numbers, just 12
wooden knobs projecting out around
I a metal box to which are attached
| two bold black hands. Such a clock,
j while highly unconventional, is dec-
I orative and utilitarian without being
obtrusive. It culls little attention to
j itself, displayed as it is against, a
| wooden wall, yet is easily, read.
The current art show is thought
; provoking certainly. It holds factors
I of interest for everyone.
