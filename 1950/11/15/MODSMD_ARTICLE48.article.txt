# ON THE BENCH WITH Al Berry

Re: last week's column: Retractions and apologies to the two fraternities
mentioned therein as being the top dogs in uncouth Row proceedings. First
of all, the Bench's sources misinformed as to the extent these houses par
ticipated, and—secondly—the Bench was wrong and ill-advised to use the
names. It was an error which we don't make very often, and we shan't
make again. As for the content of the column itself: we thought we were
right in writing it last week; we still think so.
Now, back to this week's column. Army!
I can see little use in devoting time, space, and energy to extolling on
the individual manpower of Woo-Poo's tenderloin toughies. They are first
in the nation and quite probably deserve to be there. Whether they will he
there next week is in the realm of speculation. The betting folk are currently
speculating to the tune of 21 points.
But one of the interesting aspects of the game will be Army's game psy
chology. I think they will try to crack us. They will try to beat our guys
into the ground, and njake them think that Army is the roughest, toughest,
nastiest team of all times. And then to beat us by 150 points, if they can.
Army is not a power team—in the way that California, lor example, is a
power team. They don't grind out touchdowns 10 yards at a tiniy. For
four, eight or 16 plays they won't make a nickel, then they explode! Stev
enson, Pollard, Martin, Cain, or pass-catcher Foldberg will ramble 50, GO,
or 99 yards and the six.
'I hey do that a couple of times, and the team they are playing—by now a
little groggy from too many fists in the face—begin to think that these Army
guys aren t human and they'd best go hide somewhere. This is the basis of
the Cadets' Strategy of Terror. It is one of their prime weapons: Be rough,
platoon-'em-to-death, get 'em tired and scared. And then comes the touch
down parade. Murder.
The big job of the Big Red this Saturday, or so thinks the Bench, will be
to keep these Army-guys in their proper perspective. They are very good
and very tough, but they eat, sleep, bathe, and like girls, just like every
body else.
Army is much (much, much, much) deeper than Stanford, and they are
strong in position that we are weak in. But they do not have any ball-players
that are better than Bill McColl, or Russ Pomeroy, or Jesse Cone, or Gary
Kerkorian, or a half-dozen other lads I could name. On paper they are better
than we are, but as I may have mentioned earlier this season, the game
won't be played on'paper.
It all boils down to the old basic principle of the "will to win." Desire
isn't everything—far from it—but great football teams like Army are upset
every year—every month—by teams with less natural material, but with
much more desire to win. This is where the Cards have a chance. This is
what makes football (and basketball, and baseball, etc.) interesting.
The Cards will throw things at the Cadets that they haven't seen us use
before, we will try to exploit some of the things we think might be weaker
in the Army defense. But Stanford—and each man on the Stanford team
will have to play the best football he has ever played in his life to make it
effective. One campus expert, whose opinions I respect, thinks that there is
about one chance in 10 that the Cards will be able to accomplish this.
I think the chances are good that they will play their best ball, and the odds
are less than one in five that it will be good enough to whip the Cadets.
Maybe this week's prognostication proves that sports .writers never learn,
but I'm picking Stanford over Army by 7 points.

power team. They don't grind out touchdowns 10 yards at a tiniy. For
four, eight or 16 plays they won't make a nickel, then they explode! Stev
enson, Pollard, Martin, Cain, or pass-catcher Foldberg will ramble 50, GO,
or 99 yards and the six.
'I hey do that a couple of times, and the team they are playing—by now a
little groggy from too many fists in the face—begin to think that these Army
guys aren t human and they'd best go hide somewhere. This is the basis of
the Cadets' Strategy of Terror. It is one of their prime weapons: Be rough,
platoon-'em-to-death, get 'em tired and scared. And then comes the touch
down parade. Murder.
The big job of the Big Red this Saturday, or so thinks the Bench, will be
to keep these Army-guys in their proper perspective. They are very good
and very tough, but they eat, sleep, bathe, and like girls, just like every
body else.
Army is much (much, much, much) deeper than Stanford, and they are
strong in position that we are weak in. But they do not have any ball-players
that are better than Bill McColl, or Russ Pomeroy, or Jesse Cone, or Gary
Kerkorian, or a half-dozen other lads I could name. On paper they are better
than we are, but as I may have mentioned earlier this season, the game
won't be played on'paper.
It all boils down to the old basic principle of the "will to win." Desire
isn't everything—far from it—but great football teams like Army are upset
every year—every month—by teams with less natural material, but with
much more desire to win. This is where the Cards have a chance. This is
what makes football (and basketball, and baseball, etc.) interesting.
The Cards will throw things at the Cadets that they haven't seen us use
before, we will try to exploit some of the things we think might be weaker
in the Army defense. But Stanford—and each man on the Stanford team
will have to play the best football he has ever played in his life to make it
effective. One campus expert, whose opinions I respect, thinks that there is
about one chance in 10 that the Cards will be able to accomplish this.
I think the chances are good that they will play their best ball, and the odds
are less than one in five that it will be good enough to whip the Cadets.
Maybe this week's prognostication proves that sports .writers never learn,
but I'm picking Stanford over Army by 7 points.

Re: last week's column: Retractions and apologies to the two fraternities
mentioned therein as being the top dogs in uncouth Row proceedings. First
of all, the Bench's sources misinformed as to the extent these houses par
ticipated, and—secondly—the Bench was wrong and ill-advised to use the
names. It was an error which we don't make very often, and we shan't
make again. As for the content of the column itself: we thought we were
right in writing it last week; we still think so.
Now, back to this week's column. Army!
I can see little use in devoting time, space, and energy to extolling on
the individual manpower of Woo-Poo's tenderloin toughies. They are first
in the nation and quite probably deserve to be there. Whether they will he
there next week is in the realm of speculation. The betting folk are currently
speculating to the tune of 21 points.
But one of the interesting aspects of the game will be Army's game psy
chology. I think they will try to crack us. They will try to beat our guys
into the ground, and njake them think that Army is the roughest, toughest,
nastiest team of all times. And then to beat us by 150 points, if they can.
