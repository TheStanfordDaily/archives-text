In Saturday's game at Golden
Gate Park, Stanford's teamwork
improved to such an extent that it
kept the ball in New Mexico terri
tory most of the game. The Red

goal than the visitors, but lack of
accuracy and bad luck prevented
them from scoring as many tallies.

In the words of New Mexico's j
Coach Dan Thompson, Scherer was j
lucky to come out alive after he had
a collision with his teammate Alex !
Echavaria in the second chukker.
When the two horses crashed to- i
gether at a full gallop, Echavaria ;
was thrown clear. Scherer's foot
caught in the stirrup and his horse
rolled on top of him. As his foot
fell free, his frightened horse strug
gling to its feet planted one of its
hoofs squarely on Scherer's stom
ach.
Dazed by the force of his fall,
Scherer stopped long enough to j
have his wrist taped, remounted his {
horse, and played the remaining ;
four chukkers of the game.
