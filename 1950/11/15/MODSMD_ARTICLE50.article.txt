# Biz Boys Shaded By Frosh Medics
## 
### 
The Frosh Medics and the Biz
Boys tangled in a defensive game
yesterday afternoon and the Medics ,
retained their unbeaten, unscored
upon record by grabbing a (> to 0 '
victory.
Early in the second half, after
neither team had been able to gen
erate a scoring punch in the first,
Bennie Richards, Medic quarter
back, intercepted a pass on the mid
field stripe. On the next play he
passed to John Scanlon on the 20,
and Scanlon went over the goal un
touched for the day's only TD.
