## 
### 
Intramural Director Elwyn Bugge
. announced yesterday afternoon that
! all scheduled matches in table ten
nis, handball, and horseshoes must
be played off by this coming Satur
day.
Since the three sports are run on
a tournament basis under the in
tramural program, all future pair
ings depend upon the results of
these scheduled matches.
For this reason, Bcgge explained.

it will be necessary to scratch any
teams which do not complete these
matches—and turn in the results—
before Saturday.
