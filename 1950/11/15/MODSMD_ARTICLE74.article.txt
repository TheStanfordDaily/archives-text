### GEORGE BUCKLEY 
At the Curran Theatre in San
; Francisco this week, Gian Carlo
i Menotti's delightful farce about
love vs. "The Telephone," and
the suspenseful melodrama
"The Medium," are proving that
opera is far from a dead art.
| "The Telephone" leads off the pro
gram with some wonderfully light
comedy. Although comparatively
short, it cleverly depicts the struggle
of a young man to beat a telephone to
his loquacious girl friend's heart.
Maria d'Attili and Lorcn Welch play
the only two roles very spiritedly.
"The Medium," on the other hand,
j is a gripping thriller about a charla
j tan who is driven to insanity and
I murder from a fear of the super
] natural she formerly faked.
Just one of its many original fea
tures is Menotti's use of a mute in
! a major role. The love story between
this young gypsy and the medium's
daughter is especially forceful.
Menotti's integration of story and

music in both these operas is ex
pertly handled. He shows that mod
ern music ;md a first-rate sense of
theater can be combined to provoke
laughter or chill the spine in a
thoroughly memorable, always en
tertaining way.
