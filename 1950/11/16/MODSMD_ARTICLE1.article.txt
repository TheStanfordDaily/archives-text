TOKYO, Thursday, Nov. Ifi (UP)
â€” Parka - clad American troops
fought through 20 - below - zero
weather in northeast Korea today to
the approaches of Kapsan, 20 miles
from the Manchurian border.
The Communists had fallen back
from prepared defenses all across
Korea. The withdrawal amounted
I<> 10 miles in some sectors, and
possibly more in others. Wary of
a ruse, Allied forces moved ahead
cautiously in their wake on nearly
all fronts.
The U.S. Marines reached the
sprawling Cosin reservoir. The ba
sin and hyrlroclccti ic system, which
before the war supplied most of Ko
rea's power, was one of the richest
prizes of the war and ready for the
taking.
