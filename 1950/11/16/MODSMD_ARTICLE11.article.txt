# Union Women to Car-Wash For Welfare Drive Today
## 
### 
A car wash by women of Ventura and the Union Units is today's'
event in Cardinals' four-in-one relief drive. The women, armed
with buckets, sponges, and chamois, will be on hand at the Phi
Delta Theta House from 1 to 6 p.m., and the SI charge will go en
tirely to the charity campaign.
After three days of soliciting, including a Tag Day, Dime Din-

ncrs, and housc-to-housc canvassing,
the drive has amassed a total of $285. j
I his sum represents 6 per cent of the j
$4,500 quota. Since not all of the liv
ing group solicitors have turned in
their collections each clay, the actual
total of donations is somewhat higher. I
Campaign Slogan
Mary Lou Sheehan, chairman of J
the drive, called attention to the huge
amount yet to be collected to reach
the quota and reminded students of
the campaign's slogan, "Give once for
all, enough for all." She pointed out.
that Stanford has always contributed
generously to relief drives and should
not fail now.
Miss Sheehan also urged house so- !
licitors to turn in donations to the
ASSU Office as soon as possible.
Contributions to the drive, which j
ends tomorrow, will be divided :
among the Palo Alto-Stanford Youth j
Fund, the ASSU Floating Fund, the j
American Cancer Society, and For- j
eign Relief.
Stanford "Y" Benefits
The Youth Fund's share will be re
turned to the Stanford YWCA as part
of the more than $5,000 which the "Y" |
expects 1o rcceive from the Fund. |
The Youth Fund campaign, cur- .
••pnt.lv under way, seeks to raise $84,- j
000 from Palo Alto and campus resi
dents for various youth activities in
the area.
The Stanford "Y" is financed partly j
by (he small membership fee, but ;
mainly owes its existence to the Palo j
Alto Youth Fund. The campus "Y" j
is now in its fifty-ninth year.
Open to women of all different
faiths, the "Y" regularly offers many
services to the school. These services
include the Student-Faculty Com- j
mittce, the Student Workshop, the 1
Con Home Drive's Strawberry j
Brunch, ihc "Marriage and the
Hume'' s"iics, personal counseling,
and the much-in-demand mimco- j
/raph machine which is one of the ■
few on campus that may be used by
any gioup.
Cancer Research Grant
The share of contributions which ■
goes to the American Cancer Society |
will similarly be returned to Stan- j
ford to support cancer research ac- |
livitio... The University's projects,

cently awarded a grant of $;}7,367 by j
