## 
### 
A giant syringe with moving
plunger, a salute to painful mem
ories of GI vaccinations, will be a
mid-field feature of the Stanford
Band's half-time show Saturday.
The band, led by drum major
Ray Williams, will present a music
on-thc-march version of a typical
Army man's day. The performance
will begin with the lively "Reveille"
call, and will end with the sound
ing of "Taps."
Before the kickofT the Card
bandsmen will perform two quick
stunts, then combine forces with the
Sixth Army Band from the Presidio
in San Francisco lor the National
Anthem.

Hand members are to report to
the band house at <i:45 p.m. to
morrow for the Army game rally.
Band manager Jack Blumberg
said bandsmen should wear white
shirts and levis.

The 77-pieee Presidio Band, rep
resenting the West Pointers, will
not march at half-time, but the sol
diers are also bringing a 20-man
bagpipe band.
Don Liebendorfer, Athletic News
Service Director, said yesterday
that the public address system will
be used to explain the stunts be
tween halves.
Instead of the usual stunt-by
stunt explanations, used in most
stadiums, Liebendorfer will read a
short summary explanation of all
stunts before the bandsmen take
the field.
