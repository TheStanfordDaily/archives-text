## Okays Air Attack On Bear's Lair 
### 
For what is believed to be the
first time in history, the ASSU
will officially support an air
borne, pre-Big Game propa
ganda campaign directed at the
University of California some
time next Friday or Saturday.
In assuming a function previously
exerciscd by the now-defunct Stan
ford Flying Club, Excom last night
approved a proposal by the Big Game
Committee to solicit $75 from stu
dents to fly a banner over the Berke
ley campus for one and one-half
hours.
The proposal was submitted by
committee chairman Phil Ncilson.
Neilson said the undertaking had
the Administration's blessing, so
long as it did not include bombard
ing the enemy camp with leaflets.
Leaflet-bombing, Neilson revealed,
involves flying "pretty low*' and thus
violates a Berkeley city ordinance.
The chairman also stated that Berke
ley has an ordinance relating to "clut
tering up the streets."
However, lie said. C'al intends to
bomb us with lenflels sometime
next week.
Ncilson said the committee had
first considered using a helicopter to
tow the sign or a zeppelin complete
with "flashing neon lights." Both pro
posals, however, are too expensive, he
told representatives.
In other business last night, Excom
decided to go ahead with an investi
gation of some sort of Stanford sym
bol which would be a fair target for
invading students from other uni
versities.
Members approved the formation
of a special survey committee, oper
ating under Excom, to poll student
opinion on matters of student or pub
lic interest. John Traina was ap
pointed chairman.
It was also agreed that administra
tive boards and committees of ASSU
may request the aid of the survey
committee when they consider it de
sirable.
ICxcom approved a proposal sub
mitted by Stanford's fraternities t«»
solicit within their houses for
'I hanksgiving charity baskets,
which will be presented to needy
mothers attending the Redwood
City Child Care Center.
ASSU President Ted Buttncr
named representative Phil Sacta to
investigate the possibility of opening
the Stanford Museum periodically for
tours for Stanford students and the
general public. Sacta will also in
vestigate the much-discusscd pro
posal to open Hoover Tower on Sun
days.
