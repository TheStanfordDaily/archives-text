# Unchartered Alumni Ass'n Anti-Marchie
## 
### 
A new angle appeared yesterday
in the jumbled puzzle which has
surrounded the contract of Marchie
Schwartz as mimeographed petition
blanks were distributed in living
groups for students to sign and send
to the Board of Trustees, to the
Stanford Athletic Board, and to The
Daily.
The blanks were prepared by a
group called the "Executive Com
mittee, The Stanford Jr. Alumni
Ass'n of San Francisco."
However, after investigation by
the Stanford Alumni Oflicc it was
learned that there is "no such or
ganization in the records of the
Alumni Association." What's more,
the Alumni Office said there has
been no notice of the group ever
having been formed.
Along with the piles of blanks
which were left in living groups
were several copies of a letter ex
plaining the reasons for the "Junior
Alumni Association" opposing
Schwartz' contract.
The printed forms stated: "Head
Football Coach M arch mi nt
Schwartz has been offered a new
five-year contract at Stanford.
We feel that this action is un
wise and uncalled-for due to bis
past record, and is also unpopular
with the majority of the Stanford
family."
The statement which was pre
pared for students to send to The
Daily said, "As you are the recog
nized voice of Stanford, I would
to bring 1o your attention that T
am one dissatisfied member of the
Stanford Family who feels that the
new five-year contract for Mr.
Schwartz is a mistake,"
"I further feel that scvious con
sideration should be ,liven to the
selection of a new bead football
coach and staff."
A letter was sent to The Daily
this weekend introducing the pe
tition which was to follow this
week. It was signed for the Execu
tive Committee, Stanford Jr. Alum
ni Association of San Francisco, by
John D. Wecden, '50, and Norma
Raymond, MB.
Twenty-one petitions were re
ceived by The Daily yesterday in
the first day's mail.
