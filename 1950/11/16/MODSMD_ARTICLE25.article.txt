### VIC PALMIERI 
Sure is a lot of alarming talk going round about
lhis big Lad Army team that's coming out to play (?)
In rt Satuiday. Seems like all the local football ex
perts are working up a very mild hysteria at the
thought of our poor kid:- going up against those mean

in* n from Pest Point.
Well, myself, I've got nothing
but contempt for such talk, be
cause I know about a little group
i,n this campus with a football
team that would make pure mince
111«•:»t of Blaik's black Nights.
. . . yeah, that's right, I mean the
Firehouse boys.

like talk about the legendary teams of old . . .
lilt' l our Horsemen, the Vow Boys, the Wonder
'iVauis . . . believe me, this Firehouse bunch could
take Vm all on at the same time and not get up a
sweat.
You hear about Notre Dame winning 36 games in
a tow without a loss . . . you hear about Washington
winning every game for six straight years . . . The
Stanford Firehouse hasn't.won a fame by less than .'JO
points since 18911!
1 would very much like to see that Army team meet
our local smoke eaters. They'd wish they were back at

Valley Forge. These Firehouse kids play the roughest
. . . hardest, meanest brand of football this side of
the Atlantic.
Take it from the Pah) Alto Hospital they pay
a man iust to warn them when the Firehouse has a
game so they can get the place ready for the rush.
It's hard to understand how they can turn out such
fabulous intramural teams there, and still find time
to put out a few fires.
Course they practice a lot . . . in fact, I noticed that
house on Salvatierra start burning that morning but I
was afraid to turn in an alarm ... I knew what would
happen to me if 1 interrupted intramural practice at
the Firehouse.
Actually, (lie explanation lies in the fact that
they've got the greatest recruiting system since West
Point started drafting football players.
Every year in fact they grab three or four of Mar
chie's best prospects. No wonder their brand of ball
makes the Big Jted look like it ought to play between
halves.
So don't give me any of this "Army's too rough for
Stanford" stuff ... I notice Marchie's been spending
a lot of time around that Firehouse lately. He just
might have those boys suit up against Army Satur
day and cripple America's war effort for the next
five years. 1

Stanford Firehouse hasn't.won a fame by less than .'JO
points since 18911!
1 would very much like to see that Army team meet
our local smoke eaters. They'd wish they were back at

Valley Forge. These Firehouse kids play the roughest
. . . hardest, meanest brand of football this side of
the Atlantic.
Take it from the Pah) Alto Hospital they pay
a man iust to warn them when the Firehouse has a
game so they can get the place ready for the rush.
It's hard to understand how they can turn out such
fabulous intramural teams there, and still find time
to put out a few fires.
Course they practice a lot . . . in fact, I noticed that
house on Salvatierra start burning that morning but I
was afraid to turn in an alarm ... I knew what would
happen to me if 1 interrupted intramural practice at
the Firehouse.
Actually, (lie explanation lies in the fact that
they've got the greatest recruiting system since West
Point started drafting football players.
Every year in fact they grab three or four of Mar
chie's best prospects. No wonder their brand of ball
makes the Big Jted look like it ought to play between
halves.
So don't give me any of this "Army's too rough for
Stanford" stuff ... I notice Marchie's been spending
a lot of time around that Firehouse lately. He just
might have those boys suit up against Army Satur
day and cripple America's war effort for the next
five years. 1

Sure is a lot of alarming talk going round about
lhis big Lad Army team that's coming out to play (?)
In rt Satuiday. Seems like all the local football ex
perts are working up a very mild hysteria at the
thought of our poor kid:- going up against those mean

in* n from Pest Point.
Well, myself, I've got nothing
but contempt for such talk, be
cause I know about a little group
i,n this campus with a football
team that would make pure mince
111«•:»t of Blaik's black Nights.
. . . yeah, that's right, I mean the
Firehouse boys.

like talk about the legendary teams of old . . .
lilt' l our Horsemen, the Vow Boys, the Wonder
'iVauis . . . believe me, this Firehouse bunch could
take Vm all on at the same time and not get up a
sweat.
You hear about Notre Dame winning 36 games in
a tow without a loss . . . you hear about Washington
winning every game for six straight years . . . The
