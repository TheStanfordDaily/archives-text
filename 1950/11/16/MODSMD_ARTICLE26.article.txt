# Branner's Dateless Ones Cast Evil Spell Over Head of Daily Columnist

Allrightallrightallright . . . blame it on the sunspots
or the price of eggs in Denmark, but according to the
'1 (Otter Poll, operating on the underground grapevine
that extends from the lower Koble caverns to the
Branner-Toyon tunnel, approximately V2 (that is a .5
ratio, Dean Winbigler) of the female members of the
.Stanford Family do not have dates on Big Game Night.
Not all of the blame can be thrown on the stoop,
ing shoulders of Vic Palmieri, the little Dutch buy
who lei his finger out of the dike to let loose a Hood
<if co-ed complaints with all this Dutch Treat busi
ness.
(Ignore the rumor that Queen Juliana has bestowed
the Grand Order of the Dutch Duchy on the youth for
bravery above and beyond the call of duty. That medal
you see 011 Palmieri happens to be the Purple Heart,
token of an encounter on a dark night with a date-
It..s junior transfer.)
Some of the blame goes to the men whose brains
were corrupted during their first weeks at Encina by
tiny loudspeakers concealed beneath their pillows that
r';;.Â»eated all night, "Ratio, ratio, three to one; find a
girl off-campus if you want to have fun."

The loudspeakers were discovered to have been
placed there by a delegation from a San Jose State
sorority and have since been removed by the Admin
istration. Some of them have been converted and
are now being used to teach plays to the football
team.
But it was too late. For these are the men who are
so busy trying to find dates from Paly, Sequoia, and
Dogpateh High that ihey ignore the queens in their
own classes. (Hence the expression "Queens Are Al
ways Greener 011 the Other Side of the Fence.")
But the point of all this is that there are hundreds
of girls without dates, and perhaps the twain shall
never meet. But if the situation is not improved,
AWS may sponsor another Tag Day . . . for a dime
contribution for a funeral pyre, each girl will be able
to wear a tag reading ... I DON'T HAVE A DATE
EITHER, SO LET ME AT VIC PALMIERI.
REMEMBER . . .
Big Game Night is the twenty-fifth,
Thanksgiving's the twenty-third,
If we don't have dates on Saturday night,
Palmieri's a roasted bird.
