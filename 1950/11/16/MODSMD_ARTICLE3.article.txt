### 
WASIIINGTONâ€”Secretary of the
Treasury John W. Snyder urged
Congress today to levy a $4-billion
a - year supertax on business to
combat inflation and help finance
defense" spending.
He said the proposed business tax
would increase federal revenue to
about $47 billion a year.
While that would keep the gov
ernment in the black during the
current fiscal year, when total
.spending is estimated at $45 billion,
Snyder warned that the full cost of
the defense program is yet to be
felt.
Manly Fleischmann, general
counsel of the National Production
authority, told reporters today that
defense spending alone may jump
$50 billion or $60 billion next year.
