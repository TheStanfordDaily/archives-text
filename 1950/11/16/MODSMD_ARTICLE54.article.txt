# Aggies Sow Oats at TU
## 
### 
Here's a tip for enterprising Stan
ford students, with an agricultural
background, who hope to stir up
Big Game rivalry in the near fu
ture.
The Texas Aggies made their
mark on the rival Texas University
campus without paint or brush,
merely wild oats. They sowed their
oats in the form of a big "A&M" in
the middle of the Texas Memorial
Stadium.
The oat shoots stretched from the
north 30-yard line to the south 35-
yard line. The Aggie "planters"
sneaked into the stadium one Sat
urday while most of the Texas stu
dent body was at a game played
away from home The layer of oats
was discovered by the grounds
foreman, but attempts to remove it
failed.
"The Aggies couldn't have picked ;
a better lime to plant," one of the
Texans said. "Friday we spread
commercial fertilizer on the field in
preparation for the Arkansas game, ;
and we had to water it after that
even though we knew the oats were
there."
