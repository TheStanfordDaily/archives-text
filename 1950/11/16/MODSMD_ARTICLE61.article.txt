## Midweek Musings 
### 
For the first time in four years of loyal rooting for the Big Red, we missed
a Farm home football game last Saturday. Reason: an excursion into the
Strawberry Canyon lair of the Berkeley Bear to watch Pappy's crew against
the southern cousin. What we saw, to the tune of 35 to 0, was so impressive
that we're going to pass over the subject of Earl Blaik's panzer division and
look ahead to next week's 53rd Big Game.
First, for a moment, let's combine the topics of Cal and Army. It's been
suggested that, were the Cadets to face the Bears this Saturday ir stead of
Stanford, the result might well determine the mythical championship of
these here states. Others have scoffed at any such significance, pointing out
that the West Pointers simply do not play football of the college variety,
are in another class altogether. Perhaps, but we're convinced that the type
of ball displayed by Cal last Saturday would rate them at least a close
match against the country's finest.
Bears Reach Potential
Admittedly, their performance against UCLA was their best of the year.
But what is more logical than to assume that California, which started the
season with a predominance of untried material, is just now reaching its
fullest potentialities. The Bears didn't give the appearance of fired-up
collegians playing over their heads. They looked like a football team,
through and through.
11 nothing else, Cal disproved the old notion that they're always "just
good enough to win, no better." They did it, not against a breather oppo
nent, but against the team that had been considered as the only other likely
contender for the trip to Pasadena.
Whether or not UCLA is capable of more than they produced in Berkeley
is, as usual, a moot question. Last Saturday they simply didn't get the chance
to show ,what they have. The Cal line, sparked by one Les Richter, mur
dered every running attempt at the line of scrimmage, spilled the Bruin
passers consistently before they could get the ball away.
But even when the Bruins were able to get a pass away, the attempt was
useless against the impregnable Bear pass defense. You might recall that
these were the same pass patterns that had Stanford reeling all afternoon
during the Coliseum clambake last month.
Offensively, Cal could have scored liO points instead of 35 had Pappy been
disposed to allow his first-stringers to run out the game. But the titanic trio
of Schabarum, Monachino, and Olszewski needs no further publicity at this
juncture. Suffice it to say that they were magnificent as usual.
However, it is interesting to note that Schabarum, who sports the lowest
running average of the three, was the outstanding member of the trio from
where we sat Saturday. Excluding, of course, sophomore Olszewski's 73-yard
ti ind lor the fourth TD, Schabarum was the lad who got the yardage when
it was really needed.
Pile-drivin' Pete isn't as deceptive or speedy as Olszewski, hut against the
Brqins at least he was a harder hitter, more obstinate scrapper than the
more Hashy newcomer.
Marines Solves yB and Passer Problem
Two more ex-notions were dispelled by the Beais when it was proven that
(J) Cut has a quarterback and (2) Cal has a passer. They're both named
Jim Marinos, and therein lies an interesting tale of the whims of fate.
The quarterback position caused Pappy more sleepless nights this year
than the rest of the team combined, until Marinos arose out of the fifth
string depths to save the day and Pappy's disposition.
But Pappy can claim little credit for the discovery. It was the California
team as a whole who, alter Marinos hadn't even suited up the week before,
insured the popular senior a chance to show his stuff against USC by elect
ing him team captain for the Coliseum engagement. Jim performed well,
though not spectacularly, in that one and began the steady rise which cul
minated with his 60-minute performance against UCLA.
Marinos is a clever ball-handler, a dependable signal-caller; and while
the need for passing doesn't arise very often where Cal is concerned, Jim is
capable of a professional aerial job when required. Witness his .633 comple
tion average, currently the highest in the Conference. In two games, he's
completed enough passes (19) to rate him tenth in the PCC in that depart
ment on the total season's records.
One more time while we're discussing the Cal backfield. Don't look for
their runners to make their yardage through gaping holes in the Stanford
line. Half an inch for half a second and one of the terrible three will be in the
Card secondary.
An interesting development occurred in the waning stages of the UCLA
fi ay which, had the score been closer, might have caused an awful stink.
During the course of the Bruin threat against the Cal reserves, tailback
Arceneaux tossed one into the flat on the Bear 19. His receiver, whose back
was to the rest of the players and all the referees, juggled the ball, dropped
It, then fell on it with a Cal defender on his back. The pass was ruled com
plete, as indeed it must have seemed to the ref; and not more than 40,000
spectators could call him wrong.

to show ,what they have. The Cal line, sparked by one Les Richter, mur
dered every running attempt at the line of scrimmage, spilled the Bruin
passers consistently before they could get the ball away.
But even when the Bruins were able to get a pass away, the attempt was
useless against the impregnable Bear pass defense. You might recall that
these were the same pass patterns that had Stanford reeling all afternoon
during the Coliseum clambake last month.
Offensively, Cal could have scored liO points instead of 35 had Pappy been
disposed to allow his first-stringers to run out the game. But the titanic trio
of Schabarum, Monachino, and Olszewski needs no further publicity at this
juncture. Suffice it to say that they were magnificent as usual.
However, it is interesting to note that Schabarum, who sports the lowest
running average of the three, was the outstanding member of the trio from
where we sat Saturday. Excluding, of course, sophomore Olszewski's 73-yard
ti ind lor the fourth TD, Schabarum was the lad who got the yardage when
it was really needed.
Pile-drivin' Pete isn't as deceptive or speedy as Olszewski, hut against the
Brqins at least he was a harder hitter, more obstinate scrapper than the
more Hashy newcomer.
Marines Solves yB and Passer Problem
Two more ex-notions were dispelled by the Beais when it was proven that
(J) Cut has a quarterback and (2) Cal has a passer. They're both named
Jim Marinos, and therein lies an interesting tale of the whims of fate.
The quarterback position caused Pappy more sleepless nights this year
than the rest of the team combined, until Marinos arose out of the fifth
string depths to save the day and Pappy's disposition.
But Pappy can claim little credit for the discovery. It was the California
team as a whole who, alter Marinos hadn't even suited up the week before,
insured the popular senior a chance to show his stuff against USC by elect
ing him team captain for the Coliseum engagement. Jim performed well,
though not spectacularly, in that one and began the steady rise which cul
minated with his 60-minute performance against UCLA.
Marinos is a clever ball-handler, a dependable signal-caller; and while
the need for passing doesn't arise very often where Cal is concerned, Jim is
capable of a professional aerial job when required. Witness his .633 comple
tion average, currently the highest in the Conference. In two games, he's
completed enough passes (19) to rate him tenth in the PCC in that depart
ment on the total season's records.
One more time while we're discussing the Cal backfield. Don't look for
their runners to make their yardage through gaping holes in the Stanford
line. Half an inch for half a second and one of the terrible three will be in the
Card secondary.
An interesting development occurred in the waning stages of the UCLA
fi ay which, had the score been closer, might have caused an awful stink.
During the course of the Bruin threat against the Cal reserves, tailback
Arceneaux tossed one into the flat on the Bear 19. His receiver, whose back
was to the rest of the players and all the referees, juggled the ball, dropped
It, then fell on it with a Cal defender on his back. The pass was ruled com
plete, as indeed it must have seemed to the ref; and not more than 40,000
spectators could call him wrong.
For the first time in four years of loyal rooting for the Big Red, we missed
a Farm home football game last Saturday. Reason: an excursion into the
Strawberry Canyon lair of the Berkeley Bear to watch Pappy's crew against
the southern cousin. What we saw, to the tune of 35 to 0, was so impressive
that we're going to pass over the subject of Earl Blaik's panzer division and
look ahead to next week's 53rd Big Game.
First, for a moment, let's combine the topics of Cal and Army. It's been
suggested that, were the Cadets to face the Bears this Saturday ir stead of
Stanford, the result might well determine the mythical championship of
these here states. Others have scoffed at any such significance, pointing out
that the West Pointers simply do not play football of the college variety,
are in another class altogether. Perhaps, but we're convinced that the type
of ball displayed by Cal last Saturday would rate them at least a close
match against the country's finest.
Bears Reach Potential
Admittedly, their performance against UCLA was their best of the year.
But what is more logical than to assume that California, which started the
season with a predominance of untried material, is just now reaching its
fullest potentialities. The Bears didn't give the appearance of fired-up
collegians playing over their heads. They looked like a football team,
through and through.
11 nothing else, Cal disproved the old notion that they're always "just
good enough to win, no better." They did it, not against a breather oppo
nent, but against the team that had been considered as the only other likely
contender for the trip to Pasadena.

string depths to save the day and Pappy's disposition.
But Pappy can claim little credit for the discovery. It was the California
team as a whole who, alter Marinos hadn't even suited up the week before,
insured the popular senior a chance to show his stuff against USC by elect
ing him team captain for the Coliseum engagement. Jim performed well,
though not spectacularly, in that one and began the steady rise which cul
minated with his 60-minute performance against UCLA.
Marinos is a clever ball-handler, a dependable signal-caller; and while
the need for passing doesn't arise very often where Cal is concerned, Jim is
capable of a professional aerial job when required. Witness his .633 comple
tion average, currently the highest in the Conference. In two games, he's
completed enough passes (19) to rate him tenth in the PCC in that depart
ment on the total season's records.
One more time while we're discussing the Cal backfield. Don't look for
their runners to make their yardage through gaping holes in the Stanford
line. Half an inch for half a second and one of the terrible three will be in the
Card secondary.
An interesting development occurred in the waning stages of the UCLA
fi ay which, had the score been closer, might have caused an awful stink.
During the course of the Bruin threat against the Cal reserves, tailback
Arceneaux tossed one into the flat on the Bear 19. His receiver, whose back
was to the rest of the players and all the referees, juggled the ball, dropped
It, then fell on it with a Cal defender on his back. The pass was ruled com
plete, as indeed it must have seemed to the ref; and not more than 40,000
spectators could call him wrong.
For the first time in four years of loyal rooting for the Big Red, we missed
a Farm home football game last Saturday. Reason: an excursion into the
Strawberry Canyon lair of the Berkeley Bear to watch Pappy's crew against
the southern cousin. What we saw, to the tune of 35 to 0, was so impressive
that we're going to pass over the subject of Earl Blaik's panzer division and
look ahead to next week's 53rd Big Game.
First, for a moment, let's combine the topics of Cal and Army. It's been
suggested that, were the Cadets to face the Bears this Saturday ir stead of
Stanford, the result might well determine the mythical championship of
these here states. Others have scoffed at any such significance, pointing out
that the West Pointers simply do not play football of the college variety,
are in another class altogether. Perhaps, but we're convinced that the type
of ball displayed by Cal last Saturday would rate them at least a close
match against the country's finest.
Bears Reach Potential
Admittedly, their performance against UCLA was their best of the year.
But what is more logical than to assume that California, which started the
season with a predominance of untried material, is just now reaching its
fullest potentialities. The Bears didn't give the appearance of fired-up
collegians playing over their heads. They looked like a football team,
through and through.
11 nothing else, Cal disproved the old notion that they're always "just
good enough to win, no better." They did it, not against a breather oppo
nent, but against the team that had been considered as the only other likely
contender for the trip to Pasadena.
Whether or not UCLA is capable of more than they produced in Berkeley
is, as usual, a moot question. Last Saturday they simply didn't get the chance
to show ,what they have. The Cal line, sparked by one Les Richter, mur
dered every running attempt at the line of scrimmage, spilled the Bruin
passers consistently before they could get the ball away.
But even when the Bruins were able to get a pass away, the attempt was
useless against the impregnable Bear pass defense. You might recall that
these were the same pass patterns that had Stanford reeling all afternoon
during the Coliseum clambake last month.
Offensively, Cal could have scored liO points instead of 35 had Pappy been
disposed to allow his first-stringers to run out the game. But the titanic trio
of Schabarum, Monachino, and Olszewski needs no further publicity at this
juncture. Suffice it to say that they were magnificent as usual.
However, it is interesting to note that Schabarum, who sports the lowest
running average of the three, was the outstanding member of the trio from
where we sat Saturday. Excluding, of course, sophomore Olszewski's 73-yard
ti ind lor the fourth TD, Schabarum was the lad who got the yardage when
it was really needed.
Pile-drivin' Pete isn't as deceptive or speedy as Olszewski, hut against the
Brqins at least he was a harder hitter, more obstinate scrapper than the
more Hashy newcomer.
Marines Solves yB and Passer Problem
Two more ex-notions were dispelled by the Beais when it was proven that
(J) Cut has a quarterback and (2) Cal has a passer. They're both named
Jim Marinos, and therein lies an interesting tale of the whims of fate.
