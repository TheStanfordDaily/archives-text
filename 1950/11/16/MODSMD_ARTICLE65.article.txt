# Undefeated Kaydets Show Explosive Wins
## Season's Victims Total Six in Row 
### AL BERRY 
Army, whose very healthy foot
ball team has not savored the bitter
taste of defeat since 1947 when they
met a fantastically passing Colum
bia team, will visit the Farm Satur
day with a fair-to-middlin' season's
record.
The Kaydets opened against a
highly rated, but to date only fairly
effective, Colgate eleven at West
Point. The Colgates, who later lost
to Princeton 45-7, were scored on
once in every period to come out
on the sad end of a 28-0 drubbing.
A 94-yard run by halfback Vic.Pol
lock. a 55-yarder by fullback Gil
Stevenson, a 47-yard sprint by full
back A 1 Pollard accounted for most
of the Kaydets' damage.
The next week the West Pointers,
the papers said, started slow and
hail to wait until the second quar
ter before getting 4 into the scoring
column against Penn State. They
got into it nicely, however, via two
touchdown passes—Blaik to Fold
berg — in the second stanza and
went on to nail a pair of the mark
ers in each of the remaining quar
ters. Final score: Army 41, Penn
State 7. Incidental touchdowns were
by Stevenson, Filipski, Martin, and
Pollock.
Over the Ilunip, Michigan
The next week Army met the
team that was "to make or break
them." Or so thought the 70,000
who crowded into the Yankee Sta
dium to see the Midwesterners pull
an upset. For 15 happy minutes it
looked like Michigan might do it—
they led at the end of the first pe
riod and Army could only tie up the
contest by half-time, as Vic Pol
lock trampled over from the one
after a 52-yard march.
In the second half the Blaikmen
closed the door with a 30 - yard
pass to end John Weaver and then
again with a 32-yarder to halfback
Martin in the end zone. Then Pol
lock got around to scoring again
for the 27 to C final. >
Harvard: A Record Score
Then Army played Harvard and
afterpoint man A 1 Pollard convert
ed seven for seven. Touchdowns,
for those interested, were scored by
Pollard (2), Pollock, Stephenson,
Foldberg, Fischl, and Martin. The
final score, 49-0, was the worst de
feat the Crimson has ever suffered,
shading the 40-0 job the Stanford
Indians handed the Easterners last
year. It was the 13th consecutive
Army win over Harvard.
On Oct. 29. Army played what the
papers described as a "plucky Co
lumbia eleven." Final score, 34-0.
Pollock went for three tallies and
was followed up by Pollard and
Martin. A 1 Pollard got the first
touchdown on a small 67-yard run,
and after that it was easy for the

military science men visiting New
York.
Penn: Another Tough'e Down
The next week the Kaydets met
tough Pennsylvania and went for
their 26th consecutive win. Penn
trailed 7 to 6 throughout the first
half. Then Coach Blaik must have
mentioned something at half-time:
the third quarter saw quarterback
Blaik pitch a strike to Weaver, and
a 29-yard run by Filipski. Cadet
Filipski wound up the afternoon
for Army with a 78-yard TD trip.
Final: 28-13.
As it must to all men, death came
last week to the University of New
Mexico football team. 51-0. at West
Point, New York. Among those not
present to view the disaster were
Coach Blaik (who was scouting
Navy), and players Stephenson and
Cain who didn't bother to put on
their suits for the dull contest.
Saturday, West Point plays Stan
ford at Stanford. Time: 2 p.m.


INSPIRING REMEMBRANCES — Walt Heinedke, outstanding
center on the fighting Card team of 1928 which upset Army 26
to 0, relates the thrilling story of that game to Dick Abraham,
veteran pivotman on the 1950 version of the Big Red Machine.

went on to nail a pair of the mark
ers in each of the remaining quar
ters. Final score: Army 41, Penn
State 7. Incidental touchdowns were
by Stevenson, Filipski, Martin, and
Pollock.
Over the Ilunip, Michigan
The next week Army met the
team that was "to make or break
them." Or so thought the 70,000
who crowded into the Yankee Sta
dium to see the Midwesterners pull
an upset. For 15 happy minutes it
looked like Michigan might do it—
they led at the end of the first pe
riod and Army could only tie up the
contest by half-time, as Vic Pol
lock trampled over from the one
after a 52-yard march.
In the second half the Blaikmen
closed the door with a 30 - yard
pass to end John Weaver and then
again with a 32-yarder to halfback
Martin in the end zone. Then Pol
lock got around to scoring again
for the 27 to C final. >
Harvard: A Record Score
Then Army played Harvard and
afterpoint man A 1 Pollard convert
ed seven for seven. Touchdowns,
for those interested, were scored by
Pollard (2), Pollock, Stephenson,
Foldberg, Fischl, and Martin. The
final score, 49-0, was the worst de
feat the Crimson has ever suffered,
shading the 40-0 job the Stanford
Indians handed the Easterners last
year. It was the 13th consecutive
Army win over Harvard.
On Oct. 29. Army played what the
papers described as a "plucky Co
lumbia eleven." Final score, 34-0.
Pollock went for three tallies and
was followed up by Pollard and
Martin. A 1 Pollard got the first
touchdown on a small 67-yard run,
and after that it was easy for the

military science men visiting New
York.
Penn: Another Tough'e Down
The next week the Kaydets met
tough Pennsylvania and went for
their 26th consecutive win. Penn
trailed 7 to 6 throughout the first
half. Then Coach Blaik must have
mentioned something at half-time:
the third quarter saw quarterback
Blaik pitch a strike to Weaver, and
a 29-yard run by Filipski. Cadet
Filipski wound up the afternoon
for Army with a 78-yard TD trip.
Final: 28-13.
As it must to all men, death came
last week to the University of New
Mexico football team. 51-0. at West
Point, New York. Among those not
present to view the disaster were
Coach Blaik (who was scouting
Navy), and players Stephenson and
Cain who didn't bother to put on
their suits for the dull contest.
Saturday, West Point plays Stan
ford at Stanford. Time: 2 p.m.


INSPIRING REMEMBRANCES — Walt Heinedke, outstanding
center on the fighting Card team of 1928 which upset Army 26
to 0, relates the thrilling story of that game to Dick Abraham,
veteran pivotman on the 1950 version of the Big Red Machine.

Army, whose very healthy foot
ball team has not savored the bitter
taste of defeat since 1947 when they
met a fantastically passing Colum
bia team, will visit the Farm Satur
day with a fair-to-middlin' season's
record.
The Kaydets opened against a
highly rated, but to date only fairly
effective, Colgate eleven at West
Point. The Colgates, who later lost
to Princeton 45-7, were scored on
once in every period to come out
on the sad end of a 28-0 drubbing.
A 94-yard run by halfback Vic.Pol
lock. a 55-yarder by fullback Gil
Stevenson, a 47-yard sprint by full
back A 1 Pollard accounted for most
of the Kaydets' damage.
The next week the West Pointers,
the papers said, started slow and
hail to wait until the second quar
ter before getting 4 into the scoring
column against Penn State. They
got into it nicely, however, via two
touchdown passes—Blaik to Fold
berg — in the second stanza and
went on to nail a pair of the mark
ers in each of the remaining quar
ters. Final score: Army 41, Penn
