# Underdog Indians Dumped Army in '28
## Walt Heinecke Recalls Upset 
### 
Walt Heinecke, manager of the
campus Shell service station, well
remembers another day when Stan
ford was supposed to be run into
the ground by a thundering herd of
Cadets from V/est Point. He has
good reason to remember that day,
tor he played center on the 1928
Card team that stunned the East
by smashing the Army juggernaut
26 to 0.
Army, powerhouse of the East,
went into the game a two- to three
touchdown favorite with the only
blemish on its record a one-touch
down loss to Notre Dame. On the
other hand, the men of Pop War
ner had had an up-and-down sea
son, losing to USC and tying Cal
on the last play of the game.
The Indian squad boarded a train
for New York Saturday evening,
arriving in the big city the follow
ing Wednesday. According to Hei
necke, the odds against them didn't
worry the team at all. They all
felt that they were going to put to
gether a good game that season, and
the Army game had to be it.
On Saturday, Dec. 1, the Cards
took the field before a packed house
of 86,000 fans in Yankee Stadium.
Most of the fans had come out to
see their All-American candidate,
Chris Cable, run wild against the
lads from the Far West.
Heinecke said, "We got them on
the run right away, and kept them
there all day." He added, "We knew
we had them before the end of the
first quarter."
The Associated Press had this to
say after the game: "New York, and
especially Army Coach Biff Jones,
will long remember the play of the
Stanford line. With tiny Walt Hei
necke madder and better than ever
at center, the Cardinal defense re
mained cool, calm, and unsullied,
meanwhile ripping to shreds any
Army plays that came near and
ploughing huge holes through which
which the Card backs could carry
footballs, drive hearses, or do most
anything."
