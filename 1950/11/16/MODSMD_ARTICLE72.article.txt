# Tragic Comedy on Farm
## Beer Brings Fun, Problems 
### HOLBROOK TETER 
Nestled in the rolling foothills,
by a flowing stream, is a pic
turesque garden where Stanford
students are wont to gather on a
Friday afternoon to consume 816
quarts of beer.
"And this doesn't include draft or
shorties," added Leo Mandoli, co
owner of Rossotti's, as he .surveyed
the eases of bottles emptied last Fri
day.
Students who like hot, spicy tacos
with their beer travel farther down
Alpine boulevard to Mama Garcia's.
While those to whom the dangers of
Alpine or Arastradero loom large get
their beer and garlic bread at Car
lun's.
But as students munch hard
boiled eggs and wipe ofl the foam,
they little realize the long, turbulent,
and even bloody relationship of
Stanford and beer which they are
perpetuating.
Palo Alto has always been dry as
a result of clauscs in property deeds.
At the turn ol the century on the
.-acred, initialed tables of the Char
ley Mayer saloon in Mayficld, stu
dents .spilled their beer. When May-
Held went dry, extracurricular ac
tivities were moved to Menlo Park.
Mile and a Half
The University, finding local action
impossible, transferred its problem to
the state legislature. There in 1909,
the famous "mile and a half" law was
passed.
Continuing liquor troubles for the
administration, especially increased
drinking on campus, were climaxed
when an intoxicated student entered
the wrong house in Paly and was shot
to death as a burglar.
A strict discipline was imposed
leading to penalties and finally sus
pensions. Three hundred angry stu
dents protested in a disorderly pa
rade. As a consequence, several of
the demonstrators were suspended.
Hoping to force their reinstatement,
247 students signed a statement say
ing that they had taken part in the

parade and ought to receive the |
same punishment.
41 Suspended
The Committee on Student Affairs j
obliged the signers by reviewing ;
their cases. It suspended a total of j
41, and assigned other punishments.
With this, student action fizzled out,
the air was cleared, and better rela
tions restored.
A new twist was introduced in 1933
when the Roosevelt "administration I
declared 3.2 beer to be non-alcoholic.
Paly restaurateurs timidly began to
sell beer with meals only. And Stan
ford students more aggressively de- !
bated the virtues of a doughnut as a ;
meal. The movement, however, was
stamped out.
"Campus" Proper?
The University, in the meantime,
was having legal battles over the
"mile and a half" law. Was the sale
of liquor to be prohibited within a
mile and a hall of the Quad (as the
state legislature maintained) or of the
extensive boundaries of Stanford
property (as the University de
clared).' A Board of Equalization!

ruling stilted that the distance was to
!be measured from the "campus" i
; proper.
Today the transportation problem, j
j posed by the mile and a half law, is i
| of little significance to the student. j
A much more real difficulty is that of
identification. A 1 Mandoli spoke for
his Tellow businessmen when he ex
plained that he had to check the ID s
and be on the lookout for any false
j ones.
"We're over the barrel," he said.
Mike Balocca, who with his brother
! Emile owns Carlun's, added that "it's !
j not us that makes the rules."
Stanford Women
When questioned about Stanford
i women, these friends of the student
gave diverse answers. Mama Garcia
(who prefers the wine of her native
Castile, Spain) said she likes them, ;
and they like beer with their Mexican j
food. A 1 Mandoli said they have a
"large capacity—and how!"
Mike Balocca agreed, and added
that "when they're here you sure ;
know they're here. The men can't j
I hold a candle to them."
The general consensus of opinion !
was the Stanford people are fine, and I
"we like to have them around."

Mile and a Half
The University, finding local action
impossible, transferred its problem to
the state legislature. There in 1909,
the famous "mile and a half" law was
passed.
Continuing liquor troubles for the
administration, especially increased
drinking on campus, were climaxed
when an intoxicated student entered
the wrong house in Paly and was shot
to death as a burglar.
A strict discipline was imposed
leading to penalties and finally sus
pensions. Three hundred angry stu
dents protested in a disorderly pa
rade. As a consequence, several of
the demonstrators were suspended.
Hoping to force their reinstatement,
247 students signed a statement say
ing that they had taken part in the

parade and ought to receive the |
same punishment.
41 Suspended
The Committee on Student Affairs j
obliged the signers by reviewing ;
their cases. It suspended a total of j
41, and assigned other punishments.
With this, student action fizzled out,
the air was cleared, and better rela
tions restored.
A new twist was introduced in 1933
when the Roosevelt "administration I
declared 3.2 beer to be non-alcoholic.
Paly restaurateurs timidly began to
sell beer with meals only. And Stan
ford students more aggressively de- !
bated the virtues of a doughnut as a ;
meal. The movement, however, was
stamped out.
"Campus" Proper?
The University, in the meantime,
was having legal battles over the
"mile and a half" law. Was the sale
of liquor to be prohibited within a
mile and a hall of the Quad (as the
state legislature maintained) or of the
extensive boundaries of Stanford
property (as the University de
clared).' A Board of Equalization!

!be measured from the "campus" i

Stanford Women

i women, these friends of the student
gave diverse answers. Mama Garcia
(who prefers the wine of her native
Castile, Spain) said she likes them, ;
and they like beer with their Mexican j
food. A 1 Mandoli said they have a
