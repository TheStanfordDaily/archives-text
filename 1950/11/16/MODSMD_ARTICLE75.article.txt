The Daily wishes to correct an
error in yesterday's paper in tlie
article on the Tuesday Evening Sc
ries when Dr. John D. Goheen
quoted William James as saying of
Stanford:
"The whole thing might he Uto
pian; it is only half-Utopian. . . .
But the half success is great enough
to make one see the great advan
tages that come to this country from
encouraging public - spirited mil
lionaires to indulge their griefs,
however eccentric." The word
griefs appeared mistakenly as the
word freaks.
