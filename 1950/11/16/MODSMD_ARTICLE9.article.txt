One-third of the money contrib

made possible up to 1,500 used
books and four tons of clothing each
year for .student communities
working to pull an educational sys

SIRO's purpose, beyond mate
rial aid. is a world-wide unity
of university students in which
Stanford will participate. The re
sults of foreign relief can partly
be seen in letters sent to SIRO
from abroad.

heart of every Filipino," writes a
director of the Lopez .Jaena Memo
rial College in the Philippines.

a real understanding between our
countries."
