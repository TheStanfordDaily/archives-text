# Welfare Drive Closes Today
## 
### 
The welfare drive goes into its fifth and final day today with a
Y Cake Sale scheduled for from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in front of the
Cellar.
The pastries will sell for 10 cents. Should it rain, the "Y" will
move its wares inside the Cellar and the sale will continue as
scheduled.
The downpour caused the cancellation of the planned Car Wash.

♦If skies clear, the women from
Ventura and the Union units will
be on hand at the Phi Delta Thcta
house from 1 to 6 this afternoon to
wash autos for $1. Proceeds will go
| to the drive.
As of last night, four (lavs of
living group solicitations, a I)iinc
Dinner, collection booths, and a
Tag Day had produced a total of
$170. This sum is barely 10 per
cent of the campaign's quota of
$4,500.
Solicitors will turn in their col
lections at the ASSU office between
3:30 and 4:30 this afternoon and
; from 8 to 10 tomorrow morning.
This solicitation is the only one of
the quarter and was so planned as
ito allow students to donate their
j money to four charities at one time.
Dr. -A. Clark GrifTin, assistant
| professor of chemistry, and one of
i the Farm's cancer researchers, said,
'Our research thus far has been
j successful, and I believe that fur
ther studies . . . will add greatly
to our knowledge of the cancerous
' diseases."
Twenty - five per cent of the
funds collected this week will go
to the American Cancer Society,
which in turn supports the cancer
research activities at Stanford.
Miss Elva Fay Brown, Chief
i Counselor of Women, says,"The
i campus YWCA makes a unique
contribution 1o tb-> University's life
■ by providing a laboratory for stu
dent projects, by offering opportu
nities for directed discussions, and
I by providing a working relationship
of student;; and community."
Forty per rent of the drive's
money will be given to the Palo
Alto-Stanford Youth Fund, which
in turn is almost the sole support
of the campus "Y."
A director of the Lope/. Jacna
Memorial College in the Philippines
writes, "You (Stanford students)
are writing your name in letters of
golfl in the heart of every student
of the school."
Twenty-five per cent of Stan
ford students' donations goes to
SII'O, which supports such uni
versities as the above Philippine
school.
The floating fund receives 10 per
cent of the drive's proceeds.
