# Inspired Cards Up For Knights' Raid
## 
### AL BERRY 
Rain or shine tomorrow, the Stanford football team will keep an interesting appointment with
Army's famed Black Knights of the Hudson, in -the Stanford Stadium at 2 p.m.
A crowd of some 70,000 people is expected to elbow its way into the local oval to watch the
heavily favored Cadets make their first West Coast appearance since a likewise underdog Indian
team pummeled the Hudson's finest, 28 to 6, in 1 929.
Coach Earl Blaik's charges have not been beaten since a Columbia team. 21-point underdogs, out-

passed them in 1947, and will be after *
their 28th consecutive win tomorrow.
The amazing win streak, one of
modern football's longest, has been
marred only by a fighting, never
say-die Navy eleven in 1948. The
Middies were behind 21 to 14 with
five minutes to go when a pint-sized
battleship named Hawkins blasted
into military paydirt. The final, for
the record, was 21 to 21.
1950 Cadets Best
Many experts, however, arc quick 1
to point out that the 1950 aggregation
is !he best that the Cadets have ever
fielded. Michigan Athletic Director
F i itz Crisler, who watched the
Knights stage a last-half blasting of
his teani, said: "The 1950 Army team
has greater depth, more backs in ag
progatc, and I think it is better than j
thr war-spawned Cadets which fea
tured Doc Blanchard and Glenn
Davis."
The Pointers will start a backfield i
composed entirely of All-America
candidates: Fullback Gil Stephenson,
All-American last year, who scored
two of the six touchdowns that hum
bled Stanford in 1948.
Quarterback Bob Blaik, the coach's ;
ron, who is reputed to be a brilliant 1
field general, a good short passer, and
"an adequate replacement" for last !
year's qb, Arnold Galifia.
A T*) Per Game
The 'tarting offensive halfbacks
will be Vic Pollock and Jack Martin. ,
Pollock, so far this season, has been i
Army's best back. He has averaged j
at least one TD per game, and has 94. j
54. and 38-yard touchdown runs to
his credit. Martin is backed by
sprinter Frank Fisehl and Gene Fi
lipski who tallied twice against Penn
sylvania—one on a 78-yard ramble.
And what Army write-up would be !
complete without mention of.offense j
end, team captain. All-American Dan
f oldberg. Foldbcrg, the brother of
Hank Foldherg who All-Americaned I
at. the Point during the war, is rated j
the best football player on the Army :
squad. Which may very well make |
him tho best in the nation.
