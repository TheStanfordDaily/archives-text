# Inspired Cards Up For Knights' Raid
## 
### AL BERRY 
Rain or shine tomorrow, the Stanford football team will keep an interesting appointment with
Army's famed Black Knights of the Hudson, in -the Stanford Stadium at 2 p.m.
A crowd of some 70,000 people is expected to elbow its way into the local oval to watch the
heavily favored Cadets make their first West Coast appearance since a likewise underdog Indian
team pummeled the Hudson's finest, 28 to 6, in 1 929.
Coach Earl Blaik's charges have not been beaten since a Columbia team. 21-point underdogs, out-

passed them in 1947, and will be after *
their 28th consecutive win tomorrow.
The amazing win streak, one of
modern football's longest, has been
marred only by a fighting, never
say-die Navy eleven in 1948. The
Middies were behind 21 to 14 with
five minutes to go when a pint-sized
battleship named Hawkins blasted
into military paydirt. The final, for
the record, was 21 to 21.
1950 Cadets Best
Many experts, however, arc quick 1
to point out that the 1950 aggregation
is !he best that the Cadets have ever
fielded. Michigan Athletic Director
F i itz Crisler, who watched the
Knights stage a last-half blasting of
his teani, said: "The 1950 Army team
has greater depth, more backs in ag
progatc, and I think it is better than j
thr war-spawned Cadets which fea
tured Doc Blanchard and Glenn
Davis."
The Pointers will start a backfield i
composed entirely of All-America
candidates: Fullback Gil Stephenson,
All-American last year, who scored
two of the six touchdowns that hum
bled Stanford in 1948.
Quarterback Bob Blaik, the coach's ;
ron, who is reputed to be a brilliant 1
field general, a good short passer, and
"an adequate replacement" for last !
year's qb, Arnold Galifia.
A T*) Per Game
The 'tarting offensive halfbacks
will be Vic Pollock and Jack Martin. ,
Pollock, so far this season, has been i
Army's best back. He has averaged j
at least one TD per game, and has 94. j
54. and 38-yard touchdown runs to
his credit. Martin is backed by
sprinter Frank Fisehl and Gene Fi
lipski who tallied twice against Penn
sylvania—one on a 78-yard ramble.
And what Army write-up would be !
complete without mention of.offense j
end, team captain. All-American Dan
f oldberg. Foldbcrg, the brother of
Hank Foldherg who All-Americaned I
at. the Point during the war, is rated j
the best football player on the Army :
squad. Which may very well make |
him tho best in the nation.
Foldherg broke a collar-bone j
against Stanford in the last meeting,
and may fce out to show the Indians
just what he can do when he is in
one piece.
Spirited Practice
The Stanford team, on the other
hand feels that they are going to beat
Army, which is at least one good sign
to the Indian rooters. After a week
ol spirited and, according to Coach
Marchie Schwartz, "very satisfactory
practice,' the Cards are, they hope,
leady to surprise the military visi
tors.
The biggest blow to the Cards' vic
tory chances, which were never enor
mous, came yesterday when team
physician Stanley Lourdeaux an
nounced that starting right end Bruce
Van Alstyne would definitely not see
action in tomorrow's tussle.
Van Alstyne. who has had bad luck
with injuries all season, pulled a
trunk nerve in his neck in the Wash
ington State game last week, leaving
his left arm useless for gridiron pur
poses.
Likewise missing from the field of
battle will be tackle Dick Gaedtke
with a WSC-twisted knee, and
guard Joe Jacobs, who suffered a se

verely gashed hand in the 28 to 18
-.truggle last week.
Good Health
With the exception of these three
men, the Indians will—barring unex
pected disaster—go into the Army
game in the best health since the
Santa Clara win.
The Indians are scheduled to start
a backtield composed of Gary Ker
korian, who exploded in the WSC
game with five consecutive com
pleted passes, halfbacks Bob White
and Boyd Benson, and fullback Bob
Meyers.
1 here may, however, be a change in
the fullback spot. Second-stringer
Bob Griffin, who has been bothered
by a mid-season slump, blossomed
back to his pre-season form this
week in practice and may open the
game at full in place of Meyers, who
nas been the Indians' leading ground
gainer the last thi'ee tilts.

—Tough Cadet hack
Rain or shine tomorrow, the Stanford football team will keep an interesting appointment with
Army's famed Black Knights of the Hudson, in -the Stanford Stadium at 2 p.m.
A crowd of some 70,000 people is expected to elbow its way into the local oval to watch the
heavily favored Cadets make their first West Coast appearance since a likewise underdog Indian
team pummeled the Hudson's finest, 28 to 6, in 1 929.
Coach Earl Blaik's charges have not been beaten since a Columbia team. 21-point underdogs, out-

passed them in 1947, and will be after *
their 28th consecutive win tomorrow.
The amazing win streak, one of
modern football's longest, has been
marred only by a fighting, never
say-die Navy eleven in 1948. The
Middies were behind 21 to 14 with
five minutes to go when a pint-sized
battleship named Hawkins blasted
into military paydirt. The final, for
the record, was 21 to 21.
1950 Cadets Best
Many experts, however, arc quick 1
to point out that the 1950 aggregation
is !he best that the Cadets have ever
fielded. Michigan Athletic Director
F i itz Crisler, who watched the
Knights stage a last-half blasting of
his teani, said: "The 1950 Army team
has greater depth, more backs in ag
progatc, and I think it is better than j
thr war-spawned Cadets which fea
tured Doc Blanchard and Glenn
Davis."
The Pointers will start a backfield i
composed entirely of All-America
candidates: Fullback Gil Stephenson,
All-American last year, who scored
two of the six touchdowns that hum
bled Stanford in 1948.
Quarterback Bob Blaik, the coach's ;
ron, who is reputed to be a brilliant 1
field general, a good short passer, and
"an adequate replacement" for last !
year's qb, Arnold Galifia.
A T*) Per Game
The 'tarting offensive halfbacks
will be Vic Pollock and Jack Martin. ,
Pollock, so far this season, has been i
Army's best back. He has averaged j
at least one TD per game, and has 94. j
54. and 38-yard touchdown runs to
his credit. Martin is backed by
sprinter Frank Fisehl and Gene Fi
lipski who tallied twice against Penn
sylvania—one on a 78-yard ramble.
And what Army write-up would be !
complete without mention of.offense j
end, team captain. All-American Dan
f oldberg. Foldbcrg, the brother of
Hank Foldherg who All-Americaned I
at. the Point during the war, is rated j
the best football player on the Army :
squad. Which may very well make |
him tho best in the nation.
Foldherg broke a collar-bone j
against Stanford in the last meeting,
and may fce out to show the Indians
just what he can do when he is in
one piece.
Spirited Practice
The Stanford team, on the other
hand feels that they are going to beat
Army, which is at least one good sign
to the Indian rooters. After a week
ol spirited and, according to Coach
Marchie Schwartz, "very satisfactory
practice,' the Cards are, they hope,
leady to surprise the military visi
tors.
The biggest blow to the Cards' vic
tory chances, which were never enor
mous, came yesterday when team
physician Stanley Lourdeaux an
nounced that starting right end Bruce
Van Alstyne would definitely not see
action in tomorrow's tussle.
Van Alstyne. who has had bad luck
with injuries all season, pulled a
trunk nerve in his neck in the Wash
ington State game last week, leaving
his left arm useless for gridiron pur
poses.
Likewise missing from the field of
battle will be tackle Dick Gaedtke
with a WSC-twisted knee, and
guard Joe Jacobs, who suffered a se

verely gashed hand in the 28 to 18
-.truggle last week.
Good Health
With the exception of these three
men, the Indians will—barring unex
pected disaster—go into the Army
game in the best health since the
Santa Clara win.
The Indians are scheduled to start
a backtield composed of Gary Ker
korian, who exploded in the WSC
game with five consecutive com
pleted passes, halfbacks Bob White
and Boyd Benson, and fullback Bob
Meyers.
1 here may, however, be a change in
the fullback spot. Second-stringer
Bob Griffin, who has been bothered
by a mid-season slump, blossomed
back to his pre-season form this
week in practice and may open the
game at full in place of Meyers, who
nas been the Indians' leading ground
gainer the last thi'ee tilts.

A T*) Per Game
The 'tarting offensive halfbacks
will be Vic Pollock and Jack Martin. ,
Pollock, so far this season, has been i
Army's best back. He has averaged j
at least one TD per game, and has 94. j
54. and 38-yard touchdown runs to
his credit. Martin is backed by
sprinter Frank Fisehl and Gene Fi
lipski who tallied twice against Penn
sylvania—one on a 78-yard ramble.
And what Army write-up would be !
complete without mention of.offense j
end, team captain. All-American Dan
f oldberg. Foldbcrg, the brother of
Hank Foldherg who All-Americaned I
at. the Point during the war, is rated j
the best football player on the Army :
squad. Which may very well make |
him tho best in the nation.
Foldherg broke a collar-bone j
against Stanford in the last meeting,
and may fce out to show the Indians
just what he can do when he is in
one piece.
Spirited Practice
The Stanford team, on the other
hand feels that they are going to beat
Army, which is at least one good sign
to the Indian rooters. After a week
ol spirited and, according to Coach
Marchie Schwartz, "very satisfactory
practice,' the Cards are, they hope,
leady to surprise the military visi
tors.
The biggest blow to the Cards' vic
tory chances, which were never enor
mous, came yesterday when team
physician Stanley Lourdeaux an
nounced that starting right end Bruce
Van Alstyne would definitely not see
action in tomorrow's tussle.
Van Alstyne. who has had bad luck
with injuries all season, pulled a
trunk nerve in his neck in the Wash
ington State game last week, leaving
his left arm useless for gridiron pur
poses.
Likewise missing from the field of
battle will be tackle Dick Gaedtke
with a WSC-twisted knee, and
guard Joe Jacobs, who suffered a se

verely gashed hand in the 28 to 18
-.truggle last week.
Good Health
With the exception of these three
men, the Indians will—barring unex
pected disaster—go into the Army
game in the best health since the
Santa Clara win.
The Indians are scheduled to start
a backtield composed of Gary Ker
korian, who exploded in the WSC
game with five consecutive com
pleted passes, halfbacks Bob White
and Boyd Benson, and fullback Bob
Meyers.
1 here may, however, be a change in
the fullback spot. Second-stringer
Bob Griffin, who has been bothered
by a mid-season slump, blossomed
back to his pre-season form this
week in practice and may open the
game at full in place of Meyers, who
nas been the Indians' leading ground
gainer the last thi'ee tilts.

—Tough Cadet hack
Rain or shine tomorrow, the Stanford football team will keep an interesting appointment with
Army's famed Black Knights of the Hudson, in -the Stanford Stadium at 2 p.m.
A crowd of some 70,000 people is expected to elbow its way into the local oval to watch the
heavily favored Cadets make their first West Coast appearance since a likewise underdog Indian
team pummeled the Hudson's finest, 28 to 6, in 1 929.
Coach Earl Blaik's charges have not been beaten since a Columbia team. 21-point underdogs, out-

passed them in 1947, and will be after *
their 28th consecutive win tomorrow.
The amazing win streak, one of
modern football's longest, has been
marred only by a fighting, never
say-die Navy eleven in 1948. The
Middies were behind 21 to 14 with
five minutes to go when a pint-sized
battleship named Hawkins blasted
into military paydirt. The final, for
the record, was 21 to 21.
1950 Cadets Best
Many experts, however, arc quick 1
to point out that the 1950 aggregation
is !he best that the Cadets have ever
fielded. Michigan Athletic Director
F i itz Crisler, who watched the
Knights stage a last-half blasting of
his teani, said: "The 1950 Army team
has greater depth, more backs in ag
progatc, and I think it is better than j
thr war-spawned Cadets which fea
tured Doc Blanchard and Glenn
Davis."
The Pointers will start a backfield i
composed entirely of All-America
candidates: Fullback Gil Stephenson,
All-American last year, who scored
two of the six touchdowns that hum
bled Stanford in 1948.
Quarterback Bob Blaik, the coach's ;
ron, who is reputed to be a brilliant 1
field general, a good short passer, and
"an adequate replacement" for last !
year's qb, Arnold Galifia.
