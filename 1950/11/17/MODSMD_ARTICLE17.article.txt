# Board Gives Marchie OK On Contract
## 
### 
Stanford moved one step closer
to the signing of Coach Marchie
j Schwartz for a five-year contract as
i the Board of Trustees approved
j the earlier recommendation of the
j Stanford Athletic Board and Presi-
I dent Sterling for the contract,
j Schwartz has yet to sign the con-
I tract.
Ihe decision was made at yes
terdays regular monthly meeting
of the board in San Francisco de
! spite pressure on both the Board
of Trustees and the Athletic
Board by alumni and student pe
titioners.
The proposed ASSU amendment,
| which would permit students as
! members of the student body to
: adopt statements expressing student
| opinion, was not. discussed at the
j Trustees' meeting.
The amendment had been 'sp
j proved in form by the Political Sci
ence Department and the Law
School but has to be approved by
| the Trustees as conforming to Uni
{ versity policy. Those closest to the
j scene felt sure the amendment
j would appear on the Trustees' De
| comber agenda.
The Board's statement, issued
by Board President Paul C. Ed
i wards, said:
"At a regular meeting today, in
San Francisco, the Board of Trus
| tees approved the recommendation
of the Stanford Athletic Board and
! President Sterling that Marchmont
i Schwartz be offered a renewal of
I his contract as director of football
j for five years from Sept. 1, 1951.
"The Board also re-endorsed the
i recommendation of the Athletic-
Board and the president for exten
; sion of the junior varsity athletic
j program."
While the Trustees were acting
on Marchie's contract, a minority
of students and alumni continued
to send petition blanks to the
Trustees, the SAB, and The Daily.
Sixteen blanks were received by
The Daily yesterday, bringing the
total to 37.
| No further developments were
reported by the Alumni Office after
their statement Wednesday which
assured The Daily that there is no
such group as the Stanford Junior
Alumni Association of San Fran
cisco, which was allegedly sponsor
ing the anti-Schwartz petitions.
