# BULL SESSION

### AL BERRY 
Most of us, for the entire extent of our 20 some-odd
yt ai's (I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt un-ala
fcOE), have been greatly concerned about the state
of ihe world.
v.'i bavt never lived when the world was not fuceg)

with :ome sort of terrible catas
trophe. We were born right before
m during the world's worst de
i.m' ioii since the Dark Ages, we
have worried about and fought
with the hated Japanazis, and
have been ripping long slivers of
hngeinail off every day in anti
cipation of nastiness from the
K i emlin.

And on top of this, we have to play Army Saturday,
ami nobody will go out with the Branner gurls Big
< Jame Night.
{be Session's advice to you today, is not to worry.
We have a solution. A solution which, if carried out
(o the last ultimate detail, will solve all of the world's
problems. I.ike a double play: from War to Army
(o Brtiliner.
'I iie trouble, dear readers (I use the plural optimis
ts ;.!ly,j, is not with the world, but rather with the
pi ople who are currently populating this mUch-ma
lii. aed sphere.
Therefore, we simply eliminate the people, and the
v."ji l«l return}; to its happy natural slate. No more will
the <00l brisk autumn air reverberate to the ugly roar
of airplane engines; no more will the lonely insect be
lapped at as he buzzes gracefully through the weeds
id the beat ol summer; no more will the calmness of
a dark winter's eve be blasted by the screech of tires
ou a wet pavement or the snarling crunch of an ack
. > k gun; no more will he graciousness of springtime be
(i, u itd by a lire-black stained forest or the choking
:iioh of I.os Angeles.
Sounds wonderful, doesn't it? And the whole thing
can be very easily accomplished by the quiet de
• (ruction of one useless little organism laughingly
l< tie wn as man.
i\ow, we ask you, what better place to take the lead
in this magnificent •process of self-elimination than
light heic at Stanford. What a beautiful thing: Stan
ford once more takes the lead in saving the world
11 ( i.i ti e horrors of war! And naturally, once Stanford
had taken the lead, the movement would spread to
other universities.
And soon very soon—the entire world would hear
fo the idea and it would (nay, will) spread like wild-

fire. And soon, with the bones of the despicable hu
man beings acting as fertilizer for the spring flowers,
the world would be a wonderful place.
Now, the method. We think that the method of
tell-destruction should lie left entirely to the discre
tion of the individual. After all, the Winds of Free
dom and so on.
However, we would like to venture a few sugges
tions on what we think would he a noble and inter
esting way to do your part in world salvation. There
will lie some who will leap off of the Hoover Tower,
l>ut this is strictly for peasants and shows a decided
lack of imagination. Besides, the constant splat
spiat-splat on the pavement would unnecessarily
disturb those students who are trying to glean a last
bit of knowledge before . . .
First of all, we recommend that Excom set up a
free guillotine in front of the Callar, with a small han
dle attachment where the individual can cut loose the
knife himself. The braver souls and campus wheels
would, of course, be expected to stick their heads in
the blocks face-up. This would characterize the no
bility and honor of the whole thing.
What a beautiful picture: Student A finishes off his
cup of Cellar coffee, carefully deposits his cup in the
container provided, flips his cigarette into the bushes,
takes ofie last hasty look at the Stanford Daily, care
fully bends over, and—swish! The world is one step
closer to perfection.
This would be the accepted way of world evacua
tion, but for those who prefer privacy, we would
recommend a hat-pin persisently jabbed into the left
ear. Since a hat-pin is round, there would he com
paratively no gooey mess, and aim would be reached.
Poison, slashed wrists, bullets, and reckless driving
are also recommended, but lack the beauty of the pre
vious two suggestions.
There will, we shamefully suppose, be some selfish
ptople in the world, who would hesitate to make
this small sacrifice for the good of the earth. But we
are quite sure that these will be few and far between,
and could easily be goaded to action by the scornful
looks of their diminishing friends, and an occasional
editorial in the Stanford Daily.
So, my friends, I ask you. Act today. Don't wait to
be one of the last to go. The time is now. Remember,
no. last brave words are necessary. Just quiet action.
The action must come immediately, because if we
hesitate we might be too late. If we fail in this the
world might soon be embroiled in another terrible
world war. And nobody wants that.

Therefore, we simply eliminate the people, and the

the <00l brisk autumn air reverberate to the ugly roar
of airplane engines; no more will the lonely insect be
lapped at as he buzzes gracefully through the weeds

Sounds wonderful, doesn't it? And the whole thing
can be very easily accomplished by the quiet de
• (ruction of one useless little organism laughingly

i\ow, we ask you, what better place to take the lead
in this magnificent •process of self-elimination than
light heic at Stanford. What a beautiful thing: Stan
ford once more takes the lead in saving the world
11 ( i.i ti e horrors of war! And naturally, once Stanford
had taken the lead, the movement would spread to
other universities.
And soon very soon—the entire world would hear
fo the idea and it would (nay, will) spread like wild-

fire. And soon, with the bones of the despicable hu
man beings acting as fertilizer for the spring flowers,
the world would be a wonderful place.
Now, the method. We think that the method of
tell-destruction should lie left entirely to the discre
tion of the individual. After all, the Winds of Free
dom and so on.
However, we would like to venture a few sugges
tions on what we think would he a noble and inter
esting way to do your part in world salvation. There
will lie some who will leap off of the Hoover Tower,
l>ut this is strictly for peasants and shows a decided
lack of imagination. Besides, the constant splat
spiat-splat on the pavement would unnecessarily
disturb those students who are trying to glean a last
bit of knowledge before . . .
First of all, we recommend that Excom set up a
free guillotine in front of the Callar, with a small han
dle attachment where the individual can cut loose the
knife himself. The braver souls and campus wheels
would, of course, be expected to stick their heads in
the blocks face-up. This would characterize the no
bility and honor of the whole thing.
What a beautiful picture: Student A finishes off his
cup of Cellar coffee, carefully deposits his cup in the
container provided, flips his cigarette into the bushes,
takes ofie last hasty look at the Stanford Daily, care
fully bends over, and—swish! The world is one step
closer to perfection.
This would be the accepted way of world evacua
tion, but for those who prefer privacy, we would
recommend a hat-pin persisently jabbed into the left
ear. Since a hat-pin is round, there would he com
paratively no gooey mess, and aim would be reached.
Poison, slashed wrists, bullets, and reckless driving
are also recommended, but lack the beauty of the pre
vious two suggestions.
There will, we shamefully suppose, be some selfish
ptople in the world, who would hesitate to make
this small sacrifice for the good of the earth. But we
are quite sure that these will be few and far between,
and could easily be goaded to action by the scornful
looks of their diminishing friends, and an occasional
editorial in the Stanford Daily.
So, my friends, I ask you. Act today. Don't wait to
be one of the last to go. The time is now. Remember,
no. last brave words are necessary. Just quiet action.
The action must come immediately, because if we
hesitate we might be too late. If we fail in this the
world might soon be embroiled in another terrible
world war. And nobody wants that.

11 ( i.i ti e horrors of war! And naturally, once Stanford
had taken the lead, the movement would spread to
other universities.
And soon very soon—the entire world would hear
fo the idea and it would (nay, will) spread like wild-

fire. And soon, with the bones of the despicable hu
man beings acting as fertilizer for the spring flowers,
the world would be a wonderful place.
Now, the method. We think that the method of
tell-destruction should lie left entirely to the discre
tion of the individual. After all, the Winds of Free
dom and so on.
However, we would like to venture a few sugges
tions on what we think would he a noble and inter
esting way to do your part in world salvation. There
will lie some who will leap off of the Hoover Tower,
l>ut this is strictly for peasants and shows a decided
lack of imagination. Besides, the constant splat
spiat-splat on the pavement would unnecessarily
disturb those students who are trying to glean a last
bit of knowledge before . . .
First of all, we recommend that Excom set up a
free guillotine in front of the Callar, with a small han
dle attachment where the individual can cut loose the
knife himself. The braver souls and campus wheels
would, of course, be expected to stick their heads in
the blocks face-up. This would characterize the no
bility and honor of the whole thing.
What a beautiful picture: Student A finishes off his
cup of Cellar coffee, carefully deposits his cup in the
container provided, flips his cigarette into the bushes,
takes ofie last hasty look at the Stanford Daily, care
fully bends over, and—swish! The world is one step
closer to perfection.
This would be the accepted way of world evacua
tion, but for those who prefer privacy, we would
recommend a hat-pin persisently jabbed into the left
ear. Since a hat-pin is round, there would he com
paratively no gooey mess, and aim would be reached.
Poison, slashed wrists, bullets, and reckless driving
are also recommended, but lack the beauty of the pre
vious two suggestions.
There will, we shamefully suppose, be some selfish
ptople in the world, who would hesitate to make
this small sacrifice for the good of the earth. But we
are quite sure that these will be few and far between,
and could easily be goaded to action by the scornful
looks of their diminishing friends, and an occasional
editorial in the Stanford Daily.
So, my friends, I ask you. Act today. Don't wait to
be one of the last to go. The time is now. Remember,
no. last brave words are necessary. Just quiet action.
The action must come immediately, because if we
hesitate we might be too late. If we fail in this the
world might soon be embroiled in another terrible
world war. And nobody wants that.

Most of us, for the entire extent of our 20 some-odd
yt ai's (I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt un-ala
fcOE), have been greatly concerned about the state
of ihe world.
v.'i bavt never lived when the world was not fuceg)

with :ome sort of terrible catas
trophe. We were born right before
m during the world's worst de
i.m' ioii since the Dark Ages, we
have worried about and fought
with the hated Japanazis, and
have been ripping long slivers of
hngeinail off every day in anti
cipation of nastiness from the
K i emlin.

And on top of this, we have to play Army Saturday,
ami nobody will go out with the Branner gurls Big
< Jame Night.
{be Session's advice to you today, is not to worry.
We have a solution. A solution which, if carried out
(o the last ultimate detail, will solve all of the world's
problems. I.ike a double play: from War to Army
(o Brtiliner.
'I iie trouble, dear readers (I use the plural optimis
ts ;.!ly,j, is not with the world, but rather with the
pi ople who are currently populating this mUch-ma
lii. aed sphere.
Therefore, we simply eliminate the people, and the
v."ji l«l return}; to its happy natural slate. No more will
the <00l brisk autumn air reverberate to the ugly roar
of airplane engines; no more will the lonely insect be
lapped at as he buzzes gracefully through the weeds
id the beat ol summer; no more will the calmness of
a dark winter's eve be blasted by the screech of tires
ou a wet pavement or the snarling crunch of an ack
. > k gun; no more will he graciousness of springtime be
(i, u itd by a lire-black stained forest or the choking
:iioh of I.os Angeles.
Sounds wonderful, doesn't it? And the whole thing
can be very easily accomplished by the quiet de
• (ruction of one useless little organism laughingly
l< tie wn as man.
i\ow, we ask you, what better place to take the lead
in this magnificent •process of self-elimination than
light heic at Stanford. What a beautiful thing: Stan
