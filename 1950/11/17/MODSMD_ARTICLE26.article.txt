# CAMPUS OPINION
## Do Classes Count? 
### 
To the Editor:
We wonder if something can't be done about Ihe
apathy of students towards certain classes. No one
I' ally benefits from a course in which he learns rna
t'-rial only well enough to repeat it parrot-fashion on
I u- final examination. Although it is often the stu
d» ill f;nilt for not taking advantage of his oppor
tunities, sometimes, perhaps, the instructor is to blame.
We feel that the teacher should stimulate a student's
intellectual curiosity so that he will thing for himself
am: look fur further information voluntarily. Can it
I < that our instructors just do not realize, for lack of
contact with us, that we aren't getting from our edu
cation what we should?
'I in vocation of students is to learn,*and learning
i' after all, not brought about by activity on the part
o! the in;;ti uctor alone.
W« would like to see, therefore, the Student-Fac
ility Committee tackle the problem of providing for
mon discussion in lecture courses, especially in the
social science classes.
