# Shady Tactics

### 
To the Editor:
The tactics used by the "Stanford Jr. Alumni Asso
ciation" in its drive to unseat Marchie Schwartz, are
j'Oirig to boomerang, not only on the Association, but
on all of us who want a full and proper inquiry re
garding Stanford football.
'I he Association seems to be nothing more than an
anti-Marchie club. Its use of a pompously official
sounding title, after the fashion of a "front" organiza
tion, can only discredit it in the eyes of those who seek
the answer to Stanford's gridiron troubles. This sort
of strategy, plus such Guatemala-style demonstrations
as the campus recently witnessed, impede more than
any other thing the finding of some straight answers
to our problem.
To explain everything in t«rms of a single factor—
the head coach—is simply not realistic. Only a full
scale legitimately sponsored inquiry into all factors—
Marchie, his assistants, athletic funds, material, etc.—
can get results. Undercover pressure-group fights over
just one of the factors can only make bad matters
worse.
