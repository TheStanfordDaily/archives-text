# Davis, Baxter Shine In "All About Eve"
## 
### AIJEAN LEVIN 
A comedy in which sophistication
collects in every highball glass and
is exhaled in every conversation, '
"All About Eve" is a delightful two
hours and 20 minutes of Bette Da
vis, epigrams, and naughty dia
logue.
In telling the story of a gold- ,
| plated little witch who wants to
i become a Broadway star, the film

shines up an old j
star which has j
become tar
nished in the 1
past few years— 11
Bette Davis.
Miss Davis;
may be likened
to the child in
the nursery

j rhyme who "when she was good
! she was very very good and when.
I she was bad she was horrid." In her
• 1
I last pictures Miss Davis has been
! horrid. In "All About Eve" she is
more than very good. She is Margo
Channing, At;iny Broadway Star,
i and when she drinks a cocktail,
; throws a tantrum, or drunkenly
| asks a pianist to play "Liebes
j traum," the picture is all hers.
Her closest competition is Anne
Baxter. As Eve who climbs over
her friends to reach stardom and
I prefers to wear their lovers instead

i of sable in the winter, Miss Baxter
has a more difficult part. She must
, convince her co-stars that she is
' sweet and innocent and sincere and
convince the audience that she is
not; and she succeeds without en
tangling her character in taffy
sweetness.
The rest of the actors are at least
1 two cocktails behind. George San
| ders, as an acid columnist, has the
1 best lines to play and delivers them
!in his unbeatable sarcastic style.
| Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, and
[.Hugh Marlowe must be almost col
orless to counteract the Fourth of
July effect of Miss Davis, and they
| perform more than adequately.
The film i:s innately tulky and the
j action slow, but only once or twice
! does this appear obvious. Write
director Joseph Munkiewiez has
hidden these weak spots beneath a
blanket of dialogue that is well
i timed, well-spoken, and sharp as
[ a piece of broken glass.
The picture i.s now playing at the
1 Stanford Theater.
