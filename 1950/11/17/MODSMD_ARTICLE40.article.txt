# SIGS WIN. 7 TO 6
## 
### 
In a close mural football game
played on a sloppy field, Sigma Chi
I defeated Beta 1 7 to 6 yesterday.
All of the scoring came in the
second half. Beta tallied after the
intermission when they recovered
their kickofT in the SX end zone.
The Sigs struck back and scored on
a pass from Denny Tuffanelli to
Bob Slobe. A Tuffanelli to Tony
Swanson pass put on the clincher.
