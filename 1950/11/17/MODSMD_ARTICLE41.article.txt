# Profs Gain On Scribes
## 
### 
Coming into the home stretch it's
I developing into a neck-and-neck
battle between the profs and the
sport scribes, with the scribes hold
ing on to a slim one-game lead.
Last week was the pickers' best
week so far, the favorites romping
i in pretty much according to plan.
Discounting the Army-New Mexico
| farce, three of the pickers missed a
perfect slate by only one game.
Professor Balch tripped up by
picking Navy over Tulane, and Pro
fessors El ward and Grommon did
likewise by favoring Vanderbilt
j over LSU. Strangely enough,
; Dwight Wilbur, the consistent lead-
I er all season, came out last for the
i week as he missed three of the
games.
He continues to hold an edge in
the total picks, however, with 72
correct. His nearest competitors,
Elward and Grommon, each have
1 G7.
