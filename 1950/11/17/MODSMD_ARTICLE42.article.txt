# Poloists Eye Cal Crucial
## 
### 
Seeking to extend their current
win streak, sweep the Cal series,
unci assure themselves of a possible
tie for first place in the PCC, the
Stanford varsity water polomen in
vade Berkeley tomorrow at 10 a.m.
after hosting the Cal Aggies in a
warm-up this afternoon at 3:30.
The Cards have won their last six
games, starting the string with a 7
to 5 victory over these self-same
Bears three weeks ago. Although
Coach Tom Haynie privately ex
pects the squad to repeat its win at
Berkeley, it is a Big Game so any
thing can happen.
Haynie will probably start Bob
Frojen. Bob Wycoff, and co-captain
Hub Stokeley at forwards; Don
Weeden, the other co-captain, Ernie
Poke, and Jerry Smith at guards;
and Marsh Pearlman at goal.
Traveling with the varsity tomor
row will be the frosh waver polo
team, who will be attempting to
complete their season undefeated
with a repeat win over a week
Bearcub septet.
