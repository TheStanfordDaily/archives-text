# Rain May Affect Field Conditions
## 
### 
Old Man Weather has been kind
to Bay Area football this fall, but it
looks like he's giving the grid game
the brush this weekend as rain
threatened skies perciÂ«< over al
ready dampened turf.
Stanford's unprotected sod may i
turn into a slippery mess when in
vading Army tackles the Indians.
On the Berkeley campus, Coach
"Pappy" Waldorf is all smiles,
knowing that when his- Golden
Bears go after their 33rd consecu
tive regular - season victory with
USF, the tilt will be played on a
dry field. The Memorial Stadium
greensward has been covered by a
huge canvas this week, but chances
for slips and slides are still possible.
