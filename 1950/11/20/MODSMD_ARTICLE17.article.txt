# Nine Roughs Caught at Cal Burning Lawn
## 
### 
Nino Stanford students were
caught last week by university po
lice on the Berkeley campus burn
ing "S's" in lawns. Their names
were sent to Stanford school au
thorities for subsequent trial by
Men's Council.
ASSU President Ted Buttncr said
yesterday that he wanted to remind
the student body that it is pledged
by a pact signed by himself and
Dean Winbigler with the Cal Ad
ministration.
Part a, section 7, of the ASSU
By-laws, entitled Disciplinary Reg
ulations, states, "As a result of the
existing intercollegiate agreement
between Stanford and the Univer
sity of California, . . . any deface
ment of property on the University
of California campus, by Stanford
! students, is prohibited and may be
punished by expulsion from the
University for the quarter in which
I the act occurs . .
This pact is designed to suppress
any kind of vandalism against the
property of either university.
Furthermore, in the past, in ac
cord with the ASSU By-law, stu
dents have been expelled for such
activities, Buttncr said.
