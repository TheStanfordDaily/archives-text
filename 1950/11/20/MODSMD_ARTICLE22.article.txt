# Almost But Not Quite---Cards Battle Nation's Best to 7 to 0
## Blaik-to-Foldberg Pass Only Score In Mud-Spattered Intersectional Tilt 
### AL BERRY 
With their only offensive hope—passing—washed away by the
constant downpour, a vicious, valiant Stanford team constructed
their battlements in the mud Saturday, and for nearly 45 minutes
played the nation's top football team —the Army—on equal terms.
The break in the 7 to 0 ballgame came with but six seconds to

go in the third quarter. The Cadet;-;,
after putting the Indians in the hole
with a beautiful punt by quarterback
Bob Blaik, marched down the field
gaining two first downs on fourth
play attempts by a matter of inches.
Then, with second down and 11
to go on the Indians' 2S, Blaik
reared back and did the impossible.
Holding the soggy ball like a shot
putter, the Army coach's very ablo
offspring heaved the heavy torpedo
into the arms of All-American end
Dan Foldberg on the Stanford five.
Foldberg went over standing up.
But by the time the gun bad gone
off at the 0 to 0 halftimc, Stanford
had already written football his
tory.

defensive line that had time and
again stopped the best that the Point
could muster. It was a ball game in
which the underdog Indians could
have won at any minute, thus pull
ing one of the biggest upsets in the
history of the game.
Three times Stanford's mighty Bill
MeColl attempted a field goal, but
the unstable footing and the leaden
ball would not pierce the uprights,
and the Cards were doomed to a
goose egg.
The real hero of the day, in the
eyes of many, was reserve quarter
back Dick Horn. It was Horn's
brilliant punting (82.8 average for
J.I kicks), as well as the sturdy
junior's fine defensive work, that
kept the hard-hitting Indians in
the ball game.
But Horn was far from alone on
the field. The defensive line—from
end to end—blasted the brilliance of
Pollock, Pollard. Stephenson, Fisehel,
and Filipj-ki, to their worst all-time
day on the ground. In the eyes of
press-box observer Grantland Rice
it was MeColl and big. blond Russ
Pomeroy who did the most damage to
the Army cause.
Colonel Blaik. the Army's Mae-
Arthur-like mentor, could not point
out the names of the Stanford play
ers who nearly shamed him. "If y&i
could tell who was out there in that
I mud." the Colonel smiled. "You were
t doing better than I could. The only
, one I kept seeing was that No. 5—
Cone. He gave us a lot of trouble."
Other names that cannot go un
mentioned for the Cards were offen
sive spark plugs Bob Griffin. Boyd
Benson, and Bobby White. It was
Griffin's kind of a day: he's not a fast
back, but he likes to blast. He blasted
j the Army Saturday.
Benson and White, who prefer a
fast, drv track, had to change their
game, and did so admirably. Soph
omore Skip Crist, another Indian
plunger, took up wlv re Griffin left
off with a .'1.2 average through the
center of the West Point line.
Defensive giants? Stanford was
loaded with them. Co-captain Gordy
j White, crippled all season, was heroic
at tackle, as was sophomore John
Broderick. Defensive ends Jack Rye
and Marv Tennefoss, and guards
Norm Manoogian, Leon King, and
Jack Bonetti also gave the Cadets all
the defense they could handle.
This reporter, like Colonel Blaik,
doesn't know whether to rate Stan
ford guard Jesse Cone as part of the
Indian defensive line, or part of the
Army offensive backfield— where he
spent most of the afternoon.
Army offensive guard, Cadet Mala
vasi, moaned after the game, "It was
lhat No. 5, I just couldn't block him.
I'd go up to hit him, and then he
wasn't there." Colonel Blaik noticed
where he was.
It was a gooey, mud-splashed bat
tle. The weather undoubtedly hurt
the visitors' offense tremendously.
Stanford was able to use what
amounted to a nine-man line, be
cause the Army couldn't pass as fre
quently as they normally would.
Their backs, the fast, slashing type,
could not break away from the cling
ing turf and the gang-tackle-in
clined Cardinals.
But Stanford, as some wag pointed
out, was playing on the same field as
the Cadets, and their main—only—
forte was passing. The passing game,
for both sides, went with the weather
man.
Army, most think, had the
better football team. There will be
few to quarrel with that—they are
national champions. But the impor
tant thing, to those wonderful 40,000
rooters who braved the unbelievably
bad weather, was that Stanford rose
up from the depths and played their
greatest ball game. They hit the Ca
dets with such fury that even the ex
perienced press-box hands were
wincing. Their tackles, generally,
were not made by one man but by
six or seven. It was a hard, clean,
murderous football game.
Army won it, and no one's com
plaining. But Stanford, which has
often looked magnificent in defeat,
left the field without disgrace, and—
perhaps — with something akin to
glory.

But Horn was far from alone on
the field. The defensive line—from
end to end—blasted the brilliance of
Pollock, Pollard. Stephenson, Fisehel,
and Filipj-ki, to their worst all-time
day on the ground. In the eyes of
press-box observer Grantland Rice
it was MeColl and big. blond Russ
Pomeroy who did the most damage to
the Army cause.
Colonel Blaik. the Army's Mae-
Arthur-like mentor, could not point
out the names of the Stanford play
ers who nearly shamed him. "If y&i
could tell who was out there in that
I mud." the Colonel smiled. "You were
t doing better than I could. The only
, one I kept seeing was that No. 5—
Cone. He gave us a lot of trouble."
Other names that cannot go un
mentioned for the Cards were offen
sive spark plugs Bob Griffin. Boyd
Benson, and Bobby White. It was
Griffin's kind of a day: he's not a fast
back, but he likes to blast. He blasted
j the Army Saturday.
Benson and White, who prefer a
fast, drv track, had to change their
game, and did so admirably. Soph
omore Skip Crist, another Indian
plunger, took up wlv re Griffin left
off with a .'1.2 average through the
center of the West Point line.
Defensive giants? Stanford was
loaded with them. Co-captain Gordy
j White, crippled all season, was heroic
at tackle, as was sophomore John
Broderick. Defensive ends Jack Rye
and Marv Tennefoss, and guards
Norm Manoogian, Leon King, and
Jack Bonetti also gave the Cadets all
the defense they could handle.
This reporter, like Colonel Blaik,
doesn't know whether to rate Stan
ford guard Jesse Cone as part of the
Indian defensive line, or part of the
Army offensive backfield— where he
spent most of the afternoon.
Army offensive guard, Cadet Mala
vasi, moaned after the game, "It was
lhat No. 5, I just couldn't block him.
I'd go up to hit him, and then he
wasn't there." Colonel Blaik noticed
where he was.
It was a gooey, mud-splashed bat
tle. The weather undoubtedly hurt
the visitors' offense tremendously.
Stanford was able to use what
amounted to a nine-man line, be
cause the Army couldn't pass as fre
quently as they normally would.
Their backs, the fast, slashing type,
could not break away from the cling
ing turf and the gang-tackle-in
clined Cardinals.
But Stanford, as some wag pointed
out, was playing on the same field as
the Cadets, and their main—only—
forte was passing. The passing game,
for both sides, went with the weather
man.
Army, most think, had the
better football team. There will be
few to quarrel with that—they are
national champions. But the impor
tant thing, to those wonderful 40,000
rooters who braved the unbelievably
bad weather, was that Stanford rose
up from the depths and played their
greatest ball game. They hit the Ca
dets with such fury that even the ex
perienced press-box hands were
wincing. Their tackles, generally,
were not made by one man but by
six or seven. It was a hard, clean,
murderous football game.
Army won it, and no one's com
plaining. But Stanford, which has
often looked magnificent in defeat,
left the field without disgrace, and—
perhaps — with something akin to
glory.

ARMY GAlN—Fullback Gil Stephenson is shown be'ng stopped
by Bill McColl after picking up six for Army in the third quar
ter.
With their only offensive hope—passing—washed away by the
constant downpour, a vicious, valiant Stanford team constructed
their battlements in the mud Saturday, and for nearly 45 minutes
played the nation's top football team —the Army—on equal terms.
The break in the 7 to 0 ballgame came with but six seconds to

go in the third quarter. The Cadet;-;,
after putting the Indians in the hole
with a beautiful punt by quarterback
Bob Blaik, marched down the field
gaining two first downs on fourth
play attempts by a matter of inches.
Then, with second down and 11
to go on the Indians' 2S, Blaik
reared back and did the impossible.
Holding the soggy ball like a shot
putter, the Army coach's very ablo
offspring heaved the heavy torpedo
into the arms of All-American end
Dan Foldberg on the Stanford five.
Foldberg went over standing up.
But by the time the gun bad gone

had already written football his

the unstable footing and the leaden

the visitors' offense tremendously.
Stanford was able to use what
amounted to a nine-man line, be
cause the Army couldn't pass as fre
quently as they normally would.
Their backs, the fast, slashing type,
could not break away from the cling
ing turf and the gang-tackle-in
clined Cardinals.
But Stanford, as some wag pointed
out, was playing on the same field as
the Cadets, and their main—only—
forte was passing. The passing game,
for both sides, went with the weather
man.
Army, most think, had the
better football team. There will be
few to quarrel with that—they are
national champions. But the impor
tant thing, to those wonderful 40,000
rooters who braved the unbelievably
bad weather, was that Stanford rose
up from the depths and played their
greatest ball game. They hit the Ca
dets with such fury that even the ex
perienced press-box hands were
wincing. Their tackles, generally,
were not made by one man but by
six or seven. It was a hard, clean,
murderous football game.
Army won it, and no one's com
plaining. But Stanford, which has
often looked magnificent in defeat,
left the field without disgrace, and—
perhaps — with something akin to
glory.
Next week: Super-Cal!


ARMY GAlN—Fullback Gil Stephenson is shown be'ng stopped
by Bill McColl after picking up six for Army in the third quar
ter.
With their only offensive hope—passing—washed away by the
constant downpour, a vicious, valiant Stanford team constructed
their battlements in the mud Saturday, and for nearly 45 minutes
played the nation's top football team —the Army—on equal terms.
The break in the 7 to 0 ballgame came with but six seconds to

go in the third quarter. The Cadet;-;,
after putting the Indians in the hole
with a beautiful punt by quarterback
Bob Blaik, marched down the field
gaining two first downs on fourth
play attempts by a matter of inches.
Then, with second down and 11
to go on the Indians' 2S, Blaik
reared back and did the impossible.
Holding the soggy ball like a shot
putter, the Army coach's very ablo
offspring heaved the heavy torpedo
into the arms of All-American end
Dan Foldberg on the Stanford five.
Foldberg went over standing up.
But by the time the gun bad gone
off at the 0 to 0 halftimc, Stanford
had already written football his
tory.

defensive line that had time and
again stopped the best that the Point
could muster. It was a ball game in
which the underdog Indians could
have won at any minute, thus pull
ing one of the biggest upsets in the
history of the game.
Three times Stanford's mighty Bill
MeColl attempted a field goal, but
the unstable footing and the leaden
ball would not pierce the uprights,
and the Cards were doomed to a
goose egg.
The real hero of the day, in the
eyes of many, was reserve quarter
back Dick Horn. It was Horn's
brilliant punting (82.8 average for
J.I kicks), as well as the sturdy
junior's fine defensive work, that
kept the hard-hitting Indians in
the ball game.
But Horn was far from alone on
the field. The defensive line—from
end to end—blasted the brilliance of
Pollock, Pollard. Stephenson, Fisehel,
and Filipj-ki, to their worst all-time
day on the ground. In the eyes of
press-box observer Grantland Rice
it was MeColl and big. blond Russ
Pomeroy who did the most damage to
the Army cause.
Colonel Blaik. the Army's Mae-
Arthur-like mentor, could not point
out the names of the Stanford play
ers who nearly shamed him. "If y&i
could tell who was out there in that
I mud." the Colonel smiled. "You were
t doing better than I could. The only
, one I kept seeing was that No. 5—
Cone. He gave us a lot of trouble."
Other names that cannot go un
mentioned for the Cards were offen
sive spark plugs Bob Griffin. Boyd
Benson, and Bobby White. It was
Griffin's kind of a day: he's not a fast
back, but he likes to blast. He blasted
j the Army Saturday.
Benson and White, who prefer a
fast, drv track, had to change their
game, and did so admirably. Soph
omore Skip Crist, another Indian
plunger, took up wlv re Griffin left

at tackle, as was sophomore John

Norm Manoogian, Leon King, and
Jack Bonetti also gave the Cadets all
the defense they could handle.
This reporter, like Colonel Blaik,
doesn't know whether to rate Stan
ford guard Jesse Cone as part of the

spent most of the afternoon.
