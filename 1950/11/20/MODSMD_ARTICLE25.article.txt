# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
OK, so Army won the Big Swim ... so the week
end's over ... so my underwear is almost dry . . .
to none ol it's funny.
OK, !-<• the weather was £ood for a million . . .
1 could say Army made two first downs rushing and
1(J floating ... 1 could gay if Marchie suited up the
water polo team we would have won. ...

I could say it was no wonder
our backs couldn't get loose . . .
they all had water on the knee
. . or . . . Billy Rose saw the
game and tried to sign up both
squads for his Aquacade.
II someone mentions the refs, I
could say they were all wet ... 1
could say there was so much wa
ter on the field it looked like a

bunch of Chinese fighting over a rice paddy.
Or the Band ... 1 could say their efforts at half
time despite the storm represented the greatest mass
heroism since the Scottish Bagpipers marched straight
into the German machine guns to lead the break
through in North Africa.
Or the rooting section ... I could say it was rain
ing so hard, every time there was a cheer six people
drowned from swallowing too much water. Or Rally
Com was sore because everyone forgot to wear white
raincoats ... or some couples came prepared with a
television set and a tarpaulin . . . and stayed 'til Sun

day when the janitors told them the game was over.
1 could go on and on ... I could say there are going
to be so many snifflers lining up for penicillin at the
Health Service today, the nurses have been practicing
on dart boards all weekend . . . and when they get
through with the back of Stanford's collective lap,
it'll be Standing Room Only in every classroom on
campus. . , .
Or the game again ... I could say if we'd had
Bobyb Anderson back we could have crawled to
victory ... or it was the only football game ever
played with six officials—five referees and a life
guard ... or I could say it was almost the biggest
naval upset since the defeat of the Spanish Armada
. . . in 1898.
Sure, I could say all those things ... or I could
say what I really feel . . . that our gang met the No. 1
team in the nation Saturday and sent them flying
home with a prayer on their lips. . . .
And I could all that after five years of it, seeing
another big "ALMOST" written across Stanford's
football ledger makes me pretty sick inside. . . .
And I think of our guys walking slowly off that field
Saturday, the cold rain streaking their muddy, beat up
faces . . . the hurt and weariness of their bodiee
showing through their black, soggy uniforms . . .
and I know there's never been a team who wanted to
win more than our boys did Saturday . . . that's why
none of it is funny.
