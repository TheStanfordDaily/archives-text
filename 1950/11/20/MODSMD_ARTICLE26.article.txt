# CAMPUS OPINION
## Case of Joe Wardlaw 
### 
To the Editor:
This is a letter from a frustrated Alum who would
like to see a Stanford football team go to the Rose
Bowl sometime within the next five years. I feel that
it is time for a little col logical analysis of the situa
tion down on the Farm.
One example of how Coach Schwartz recognizes and
develops talent. In 1948 a fellow by the name of Joe
Wardlaw registered at Stanford. He was a JC transfer
from Vallejo where he made All-Northern California
JC guard for two consecutive years. He turned out
for football at Stanford, scrimmaged the varsity faith
fully during most of the season, and was never allowed
by Schwartz to suit up for a varsity game.
1 don't know whether Schwartz thought he wasn't
good enough or whether he just got on Schwartz's
well-known list. Regardless of what it was. he did not
play and became dissatisfied. So in 1949 he went to
Cal. and, because of eligibility rules, when changing
schools he was forced to give up football for a year.
This year at Cal, Joe Wardlaw turned out for football
as a senior. Did Pappy tail to recognize the poten
tiality ol this player? NO! Pappy went to work and
by the time the Cal-SC game were here, Joe Wardlaw
was ready to go. In the Cal-SC game Wardlaw won
himsell a first-string berth as defensive guard on the
greatest Cal team since the war. Now, here was a
playei who enrolled at Stanford in 1948 and went out
lor football. He somehow became disgusted with the
football situation at Stanford and in 1950 he is playing
fii'Lt-string defensive guard for a university which, al
though it had no better talent on its freshman teams
than did Stanford, has our varsity beat ten different
ways.
For my money, I leel Schwartz should voluntarily
give up his coaching position at Stanford and relieve
all his friends of a very embarrassing situation.
