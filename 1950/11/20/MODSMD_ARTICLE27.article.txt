# Junior Alumni Explain
## 
### 
To the Editor:
John Bush's "Shady tactics" letter in lust Friday's
Daily was well written and contained some sound
criticism. That he is uninformed on two points (our
01 yanization and our aims) is our fault and not his.
The Stanford Junior Alumni Association of San
Francisco has been in existence and has used that
name for over six months. It is a loose and informal

organization that was formed to perform the social
functions that the inactive San Francisco Alumni As
sociation does not perform. Our mailing list contains
over 400 names of Stanford Alumni (Classes '40-'5O)
that live or work in San Francisco, and there were
over 150 present at the last of three successful parties
that we have sponsored so far.
Our present drive is an attempt to poll Stanford
opinion and to prove to the University that there is
much dissatisfaction among Stanford students and
alumni. This dissatisfaction is a disease that is killing
school spirit, alumni support, and monetary income.
It is a disease that will not be cured by ignoring it or
by offering a new five-year contract.
We feel that this poll is fair and certainly not biased
in our favor. A person that is merely unhappy or dis
gruntled will not bother to address and mail three
envelopes. Only thase who sincerely feel that a mis
take has been made will overcome inertia and cast
their vote by mailing in the mimeographed letters that
we are distributing.
We agree with M. Bush that an inquiry into the
entire Athletic and Alumni setup at Stanford should
be made. Our drive to oust Mr. Schwartz is an at
tempt to correct one of the many factors concerned and
to point up the need and provide the opportunity for a
complete check-up and overhaul of Stanford's badly
run down Athletic organization.
