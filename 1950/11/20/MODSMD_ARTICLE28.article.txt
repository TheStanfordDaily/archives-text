Alumni—senior or junior—who attempt over-riding
Stanford President and Athletic Board in choosing a
football coach must conceded it is a job for experts.
An expert sholuld pass an ex.
Have you played varsity-caliber football? Have
you coached? Been a professional sportswriter?
Do you check every Stanford football game? Do
you watch each weekly movie? Know each player by
position, number, and name? Each coach? Ever seen
football practice? Know who is injured, and how?
Know the length of the Stanford bench? Know the
records of others teams? Know the records of earlier
Stanford coaches, and their encounters with alumni
"wolves"? Know what university presidents—nation
wide—are thinking these days about over-pressures
on football teams, and its cures?
Which interests you most, the score or the game?
Would you be satisfied is another sector of alumni
hired and fired coaches? Would you hold them re
sponsible for mistakes? How?
II a small group of alumni chose a coach, and fired
him by the scoreboard, do you think any first class
coach would come to Stanford?
