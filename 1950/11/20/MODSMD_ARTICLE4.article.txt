# German Socialists Win
## 
### 
FRANKFURT, Germany — The
Socialist party, bitterly opposed to
the rearmament of Germany, won
two important state elections in the
Western Zone today—one of them
by an absolute majority.
The voting was viewed as an un
official ballot on whether German
soldiers should shoulder arms to
help Western Europe.
Official final results in the Ameri
can-occupied states of Wuerttem
berg-Baden and Hesse gave the So
cialists victory over Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer's Christian Dem
ocrats —the strongest advocates of
Germany's participation in West
ern Europe defense.
The Socialists made the rearma
ment issue the highlight of their
campaign. They opposed it unless
heavy American troop reinforce
ments were sent to Europe.
