# Elm Cottage Twelve Aim for Recognition
## 
### SHIRLEY ELDER 
The slogan "Obscurity is no maidenly virtue" is being revived
by 12 apparently forgotten, but still determined young campus
women.
Their home is Elm Cottage, 520 Salvatierra, tucked away be
tween the Chinese Club and the SAE's wide-eyed windows. The

undergraduate residents have start- .
ed a campaign to make this home I
known on the Farm.
Elm's chief claim to recognition, (
so some oi her residents insist, is
that she must have provided the j
inspiration for the spooky and
weird tumble - down homes of
Charles Addams' "New Yorker"
cartoons. Or perhaps Elm's archi
tect was influenced by Addams.
Variously misconstrued as a res- t
idence for graduate women, trans
fer students, or miscellaneous fac- j
ulty, Elm has for 20 years been |
primarily a residence for under- j
graduate women. Until this fall, it \
housed a majority of. transfer stu- !
dents.
The organist, Warren D. Allen. |
lived in Elm before it became an
official University residence in 1933.
Union Residence and Mariposa also
joined the University family that
year, when enrollment finally
passed the "famous 500" and 750
women entered Stanford.
Along with tlie residents of the
other Union units —Mariposa, Ma
drono, Manzanita, Casa Espanola,
and Maison Francaise —Elm retains
the advantages of a small house
with the opportunity of meeting all
the women of the Union area
through a central dining arrange
ment.
Elm, like the other Union units, ,
has a graduate HA.
A yard and trees and noisy kids j
across the street who wake up
early on Sunday mornings help
provide a neighborhood touch to
the Cottage. The sprinkler for the
down-trodden lawn is no new-fan
gled gadget, but just a plain old
sprinkler that doesn't require an
engineer to turn it on and off.
Inside, a good healthy yell is the
substitute for a buzzer system, and |

the "homey" atmosphere is un
marred by such unheard-of things
as ultra - modern furniture and
plush carpets.
Elm residents are threatening to
go into the road map business if
their obscurity doesn't vanish. But
for the moment they might settle
for a neon sign pointing to the first
yellow cracker box on the right
hand side of one-way Salvatierra.

steps of their too-long-overlooked cottage on Salvatierra street.
