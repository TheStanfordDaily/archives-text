# LOCKER ROOM
## Blaik Blames Jupe Pluvius 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Coach Earl Blaik, fashionably at
tired in a pair of waterproof "slick
er pants' still glistening from the
effects of his half-mile wade from
Stanford Stadium to the Army
dressing room, refused Saturday to
make a single concession to the In
dian varsity that had just held his
West Pointers to their narrowest
victory margin in over a year.
The thin-haived ex-Army colo
nel told a tfroup of dampened
(and less fortunately dressed) re
porters that (1) what had just
taken place in the Stadium could,
liy no stretch of the imagination,
he likened to a football game, (2)
rut decisions or comparisons could
he drawn under such conditions,
and (.'I) he was very, very happy
to win by any score on such a
day.
While he didn't say so, at least
to the reporters, Blaik gave the im
pression that he considered Stan
lord's surprise showing due entirely
to the freakish whims oi the ele
ments. He didn't offer this view
for direct quotation.
But only a few moments earlier,
the headman oi the Black Knights
was overheard telling his charges
I bat it would have been "seven
times seven" had the rain gone
away and come another day.
"Stanford's nine, man line was
definitely a smart defense today,"
he commented, "l>ut they couldn't
net away with it any other time.
No team in the country could
make any headway against such
a defense today."
Would he care to compare Stan
ford witli the likes of Michigan or
Pennsylvania?
"Definitely not. Because of the
weather, there is no basis for any
â€¢mil comparison."
Was. the colonel prepared to

name the Stanford players he con
sidered outstanding?
Once again the reply was in the
negative as Blaik implied that lie
wouldn'thave recognized his own
brother in the Stadium mire, much
less the Stanford players.
Then he added a moment later:
"Yes, I did think Cone was out
standing. And their defensive
tackles (Tex White and John
liroderick) did a line job."
On the other side of the building
Card mentor Marchie Schwartz was
asked if he was satisfied with the
outcbme of the game, which could
he looked upon as an upset of sorts.
"Certainly not. We wanted to win
this one," Schwartz replied em
phatically.
Marchie praised the efforts of his
defensive performers, particularly
liill McColl, Dick Horn, and Jack
Bonetti.
He also expressed his amaze
ment at the touchdown pass
thrown by Bob Blaik that told the
(ale of the game.
"We haven't yet been able to
figure how anyone could throw that
far in this weather. Gary (Kerko
rian) and Tom (Shaw) just couldn't
pass today. No, they weren't under
orders to stay on the ground. Pass
ing just wouldn't work."
Then the inevitable question was
raised. How about Cal?
"Don't ask. 112 want to relax to
night. Tomorrow I'll think about
Cal."
