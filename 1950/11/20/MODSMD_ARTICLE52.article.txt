# Waterpoloists in Double Win
## Cards Drown Cal To End Season 
### JIM MADISON 
Water polo was right in style in
the downpour Saturday morning,
and Stanford's varsity squad rose
to the occasion by whipping Berke
ley's Golden Bears 3 to 1.
Stanford got an early jump on ;
the Berkeleyites, scoring twice in
the first period. Bob Wycoff
plunked in the first of the two
scores, and Bob Frojen added the
second.
Cal came back in the second
quarter to pull up to 2 to 1. The
score remained 2 to 1 through the
rest of the second period, the third,
and most of the fourth period with
the Cards in control of the contest
all the way.
With one minute to go at the end
of the last quarter, co-captain Don
Weeden slipped the Cards' third,
last, and clinching goal past Hod
Lindquist, Cal's 1949 All - Coast
goalie.
The game marked the close of
1 the season for Stanford, since Coach
Tom Haynie has decided not to en
| ter the Pacific Association Tourna
ment to be held at the Olympic
Club on Nov. 29, 30, and Dec. 1.
By their victory the Cards were
assured of at least second spot in
the PCC. It is not known whether
UCLA managed to upset USC down
south on Saturday, but if they did
Stanford would be tied with the
Trojans for the conference cham
! pionship.
Only a double loss, to the Bruins
and to SC, on their southern inva
; sion marred the Cards' record for
1950, but these two losses may cost
] the Cards their championship. One
of SC's two losses was to a non
conference team, Fullerton JC.
