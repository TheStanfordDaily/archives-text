# LITTLE BIG GAME
## Broncos Whip St. Mary's 9-0 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1» (UP)
—Their running attack stalled by
the mud, Suntu Clara's Broncos
took to the airlunes to whip St.
Mary's 9 to 0 in their annual ''Little
Big Game" today before a slim
crowd of 15,000 i'ans at Kezar Sta
dium.
In a wild game, marred by pen
alties that nullified three touch- |
downs, the Broncos dominated the
game all thy way through — and
took advantage of the breaks to win
the game.
Len Napolitano, who along with
fullback Saxon Wraith was voted
the most valuable player of the
game, set up all the points with his
sharp passing. Alter Bill Payne had
recovered a St. Mary's fumble on
the Gaels' 25, Napolitano passed into
the end zone to Gern Nagler for the
first touchdown in the second quar
1 ter.
( The other three points came in
1 the final stanza on a field goal by
John Daly from the 14. This coun
! ter, too, was set up when Napoli
1 tano passed to halfback Ben Moran
for 41 yards to the Gael 16.
Earlier in the battle on the mud
| dy field, the Gaels had what looked
J like two touchdowns called back.
] In the first quarter Frank Cassara
' ran 1G yjy ds to the Bronco two, but
! the Gaels were penalized for hold
! ing. In the third frame Cassara
| went around end 35 yards into the
end zone. But this was also nullified
I by an off-side penalty.
Napolitano had passed 42 yards to
! Del Rasmussen early in the fourth,
J but Santa Clara was off-side and a
i touchdown was called back.

Cal's win over USF Saturday was
the Golden Bears' thirty-third con
secutive regular season win since
they were last beaten by USC in the
season of 1947.
