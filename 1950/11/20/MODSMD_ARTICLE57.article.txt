# Braves Keep Slate Clean, Outslush Presidio 14 to 0
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's Braves came of! the
reservation Saturday and proved
that there are still Indians in the
West who can handle tthe Army.
Playiny in ankle - oeen muH, tne
JV's forced the Presidio of San
Francisco to surrender 14 to 0.
Capitalizing on a fumble and a
blocked kick, the Braves picked up
two first-quarter touchdowns. In so
doing the Braves hung up their fifth
scalp in as many outings and go
against the Cal Ramblers boasting
an undefeated record.
The JV's scoied first when, fol
lowing a recovered Presidio fumble
on the two, quarterback Steve
Mitchell sneaked over. Fullback
Wes Laubscher drove over guard
for the extra point.
A blocked Army kick gave the
JV's their second scoring opportu
nity late in the initial period. Laub
scher picked out a hole in the Pre
sidio line and plunged through the
gap to register the second tally from

five yards out. Halfback Bill Mc-
Kay ran over for the point after
touchdown.
That was all the scoring for the
day, as neither team could move
on a field which prevented cutting,
passing, or wide play. The Presidio,
although rugged on defense, could
not sustain a drive and never
threatened. There were numerous
fumbles by both parties, and only
one pass, that by the Army.
Couch Kimberly praised the work
of his "m udders," who he said
"played well under miserable con
ditions."
