# Murray on Defense
## 
### 
CHICAGO—CIO President Philip
Murray today pledged full support
of his organization to the defense
program, but accused Congress of
"flagrant catering'' to special in
terests in preparing the nation for
mobilization.
The new Defense Production Act,
he charged, fails as a safeguard
against inflation and "only tends to
weaken the mobilization effort."
Murray declared that Congress
"ignored" rent control and an ex
cess profits tax and hit hardest at
low-income groups with its interim
tax bill.
