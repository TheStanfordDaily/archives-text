# Engineers Needed; Field Not Crowded, Skilling Says
## 
### 
There is no surplus of your.g engineers, and there isn't going to
be for many years. In fact there is going to be a great shortage.
This was the warning given Friday by Dr. Hugh H. Skilling, head
of the Stanford University Electrical Engineering Department.
Speaking to a dinner meeting of the Northern California section

of the American Institute of Electri
cal Engineers, Dr. Skilling said that
the widely heard and erroneous talk
that engineering is an overcrowded
field is is responsible for a situation
which he described as already dam
agin to the nation and threatens
to become a critical problem if engi
neering students arc drafted.
"I have a bit of bad news for those
of you who are looking forward to
employing young engineers: there
aren't going to be enough to go
around," he told the A.I.E.E. section.
No Surplus
"The total crop of engineering stu
dents graduating last June, taking
the country as a whole, was the
largest in history. But there was no
surplus. They all found jobs as
promptly as could be expected. Of
course there was the usual percent
age who didn't go into engineering
work at all, but that always happens,
and will in the future.
"Now, for the future, the numbers
run like this. These are official fig
ures, nationwide, collected by the
Monpowcr Committee of the Ameri
can Society for Engineering Educa
tion in cooperation with the Bureau
of Labor Statistics and the National
Research Council," Skilling said.
"Take the size of last June's gradu
ating class as 100. That was June
of 1950.
Less in '51
"Next year's class, 1951, will be
only 70, or about 30 per cent less.
"The following year, 1952, will he
50—down 50 per cent.
"In 1953, the number will be only
40, actually 60 per ccnt. off.
"These are not guesses; these arc
facts. These are the boys now in col
lege. all over the country. You can
count them. Nothing whatever can
increase their numbers, for engineer
ing is a four-year course," Skilling
concluded.
