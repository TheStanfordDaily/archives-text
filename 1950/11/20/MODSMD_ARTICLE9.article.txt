# WEEKEND STORMS
## Dorm Basements, Autos Suffer From Downpour 
### 
The heavy rains that lashed the campus over the weekend left
a wake of flooded basements, fallen trees, mud-anchored cars,
minor traffic accidents, and general inconveniences on the cam
pus.
Crothers, Stern, and Encina Halls all reported flooded base-

ments, the most serious at Stern, I
where a storm sewer clogged causing
the watei® to back up. In places the j
depth reached two feet in the base
ment.
Rugs stored in the Stern base
ment were soaked, but otherwise
lift damage was reported.
Four large Caterpillar tractors and [
several dozen cars bogged down and
stuck in the muddy parking areas [
around the Stadium Saturday, forc
ing many owners to abandon their
cars there.
George Greene, foreman of the
Corporation Yard ground crew, re- 1
ported pulling several dozen cars
from the mire with a winch truck
Sunday morning. The back wheels of j
many of the cars were almost com
pletely submerged.
Rains partially flooded the bed of
Lake Lagunita, normally dry in the
fall, and threatened the Rig Game
pyre, already waterlogged.
Greene reported attempts were j
made Saturday and yesterday morn- j
ing to stop the flow in the Lagunita I
flume, which carries water front
Searsville Lake into Lake Lagunita.
but that the attempts were not com
pletely successful.
Ernest Bransten, operator of Scars- j
ville Lake, said that water was over
flowing the top of Searsviile Dam
yesterday, despite opening of the 300
square-foot spillway at the dam's top.
Bransten called Scarsvillc's water
level rise the greatest in a 48-hour
period he has seen in 27 years. From
Friday to Sunday morning the levrl
rose 8.(51 inches bringing the sea
son's total rise to approximately 10.1)
inches.
Street drainage was generally good,
but some three feet of water collected
between the circle of Palm Drive and
Lasucn street across from History
Corner.
Rain water reached a depth of ap
pioximately two feet in the under
pass just ofT the campus on Embar
cadero road. Cars attempted to single
file through the tunnel after Satur
day's game, but a tow truck pulled
many stalled cars out.
Damage to cars resulted, but there
were no injuries.
Delight Kolar, secretary ol the
I sophomore class, was slightly injured

when the car in which she was riding
skidded and struck a telephone pole
near the Palo Alto City Library early
Saturday afternoon.
Numerous inconveniences were
reported during the storm—power
stoppages, blown-over trees, and
numerous leaky roofs and base
ments.
Rainfall figures recorded by the
weather bureau at Mills Field
showed a total of 1.77 inches of pre
cipitation from 4:.'10 a.m. Friday to
t:'-0 p.m. yesterday. This brings the
season's total to 4.39 inches, almost
three times the figure recorded at
this time last year, 1.69 inches.
