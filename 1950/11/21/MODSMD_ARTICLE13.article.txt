SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20— The Weatherman reported tonight

Sierra Nevada Mountains, with at least one point registering 22.55

inches in the eight-day period. San

ing the same period.
Weather Forecaster E. H. Chap
pell predicted tonight that the rain
was expected to "taper off" some
what tonight, but occasional rain
would continue through tomorrow.
The rains were caused by a "large
and vigorous" storm" which lies al
most stationary about 800 miles off
the Washington coast, sending "ac
tive disturbances" whistling down
on 500 miles of Northern California
coastline in almost unbroken suc
cession.
Chappell reported that baromet
ric pressure was rising all over the
northern part of the state, indicat
ing a storm front 400 miles at sea off
San Francisco was weakening.
Meanwhile, reclamation officials
and water masters today heralded
the end of a five-year drought in
the San Joaquin Valley, despite
flood losses running 'in millions of
dollars.
The rampaging Truckee River
spilled over its banks tonight at one
place and moved toward the center
of Reno.
