## Mud Bogs Tractor 
### 
A Palo Alto city post-hole dig
ging truck and a large Corpora
tion Yard Caterpillar tractor
bogged down and stuck in the
deep mud in Lake Lagunita yes
terday afternoon and wero
pulled out after an hour - long
battle by two Palo Alto city
winch trucks.
The post-hole digging truck stuck
while attempting to dig holes for
the 40 - foot stilts that encompass
the Big Game Bonfire. The Corpo
ration Yard "cat" Â«tried to pull the
truck out and in turn became mired
down in the slush.
The winch trucks that finally
accomplished the "rescuc" ex
tended cables out from Foothill
Road approximately 400 feet from
(he bogged-down trucks, accord
ing to Carroll L. Blacker, su
perintendent of buildings and
grounds.
The Palo Alto post-hole dinging
truck was called after the heavy
weekend rains had covered holes
dug by P. G. & E. trucks, which
traditionally dig the holes. The
P. G. & E. trucks had been sent to
Sacramento over the weekend.
Blacker also reported that the
Felt Lake flume was cleared by
Corporation Yard workers yester
day, after tree stumps and branches
knocked down by wind and rain
had clogged the stream.
Much water- was lost while the
flume was clogged that normally
would flow into Felt Lake, a storage
reservoir that irrigates the golf
course and surrounding areas dur
ing the summer months, Blacker
said.
Blacker said several cars of fhc
estimated thousand stuck Satur
day arc still anchored in the mud
around the Stadium.
The week-end rains broke all ex
isting rainfall records for a similar
period in the area.
A total of 5.02 inches of pre
cipitation was recorded by the
Corporation Yard between Fri
day and yesterday morning, most
of it recorded Saturday. This
boosts the season's tofal to B.oft
inches, a figure far above the 40-
year average of 1.90 inches to
Nov. 20.
With additional rains threatening
this week, the figure could pass last
year's total of 13.47 inches, which
includes precipitation from August
of 1949 to last August.
