Each night next week prior to the
trials, a dinner will be held at
Rickey's for the judges and their
families and the contestants.
At the trials, all contestants will
argue the same problem, which
deals with a dispute over "unlaw
ful search and seizure." The plain
tiff in the case is suing two FBI
agents for what he considers un
lawful search and seizure under the
Fourth and Fifth Amendments to
the U.S. Constitution.
All arrangements for the Moot
Court competition have been made
by the Moot Court Board of the
Law School. Headed by Bennett,
the Board is composed of Robert
Blatt, treasurer; Mrs. Green, .secre
tary; Butler, Ehrlichman, Jansen,
Harvey Himmel, Henry Witcover,
and Willens.
