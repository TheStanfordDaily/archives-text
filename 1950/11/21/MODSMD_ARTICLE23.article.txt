### 
The Big Game Float Parade has been cancelled. It was docidod
last night at a joint meeting of Cardinals and Rally Com that tho
parade would have to be called off because of the continuing rain.
"The bonfire, however, will burn Thursday night no matter what
the weather may be," Ted Hinshaw, President of Cardinals an-

nounced. More wood is being piled
on the pyre and there will be enough
Diesel oil on it to make a blaze, even
if the foundation is in a few feet of
water.
The locale of the bonfire and the
rally has been switched from the
Boathouse to the more elevated part
of Lake Lag. The road in back of the
lake, Foothill boulevard, will be
blocked off from the golf course to
Frenchman's road, and students can
stand in the road or in the part of the
lake which is not submerged in water.
The rally, which will begin at 7:15,

the bonfire and a display of fireworks.

held in the Pavilion and from there
students will trek to the lake to set
