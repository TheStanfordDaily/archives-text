# The 						Sixth Failure
## 
### 
The Relief Drive ended Friday with $1,800
collected toward a $4,500 goal and scant hope
of a substantial increase from late contribu
tions. It marked the sixth straight failure for
Stanford in not meeting a single fall relief or
Rod Cross drive in the past three years.
Not only that, but the failures are becoming
v/orse. Last year's Relief Drive, heralded as
phenomenally bad, netted $3,900, more than
twice the amount given this year.
Why has Stanford missed every community
and national charity mark since 1947?
We are three years further away from the
last war now, and the need for such things as
foreign relief perhaps does not seem so vital to
us as it once did.
Tuition and prices sky-rocketed, and stu
dents have each year reached more gingerly
into wallets for donations. Moreover, most stu
dents do not consider Stanford their home, and
it requires more persuasion to arouse their
sen so of civic duty here than in Toonyville.
Hone of these considerations, however, can
explain the failure of a charity drive. They are
merely conditions which must be taken into
accQuni when setting the goal and charting the
campaign.
Was a $4,500 goal too high? No. This meant
SI from every on-carnpus students. Off-campus
cannot be contacted personally and
therefore cannot be counted on as definite pros
pective contributors in a drive. If the private
homes on campus had been canvassed, which
they weren't, these contributions plus some
from off-campus students could have been
reasonably expected to make up for the small
percentage of students who will not give.
Was the drive handled in such a way that
students were kept constantly aware of it?
Emphatically, no. Every drive chairman real
izes that the backbone of any drive on campus
is the solicitors in each living group. As a re
sult, drives during the past three years have
leaned very heavily on the solicitor, with the
traditional tag day and cake sale thrown in for
good measure. From a publicity point of view,
this type of drive is, to say the least, quiet.
One of the mainstays of successful drives at

Stanford in the 1947 era was the so-called in- j
spirational rally with a prominent speaker'
whose topic was interesting, whether or not it
was connected with the drive. One such rally
featured a Danish newspaper editor who had
published underground during the war.
Such a rally gives a charity some sort of
"news peg" on which it can hang the well
worn hat it has been passing for years. Other
ways could be found to accomplish the same
purpose.
There is no reason why Stanford cannot go
over the top in the Red Cross drive next quarter .
if it does not let the Red Cross re-play its old i
trick of insisting on counting off-campus stu
dents for full donations when the quota is set.
Cardinals has charge of that drive, as it had
charge of this last one. Between now and the
middle of February, Cardinals can plan a well
timed and well-managed drive.
If it does not plan such a drive, Stanford will
come into the seventh inning for another lost
game. â€”D.J.
