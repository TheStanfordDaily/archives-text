# Observe the Pact
## 
### 
Fifteen Stanford freshmen were appre
hended over the weekend for damaging Cal
property during a pre-Big Game raid. Their
pranks were probably not serious as individual
incidents, but the results are considerably more
than unpleasant when you consider the snow
balling effect of one raid.
It is merely an invitation for retaliation from
the Berkeley camp. It is also an invitation for
Cal raiders to disfigure the Hoover Tower.
Both universities have attempted to curb
property-damaging activity by signing a "non
aggression pact."
Upperclassmen who have furnished fresh
men with paint and equipment only encourage
the breaking of this agreement.
It is also up to the students to cooperate with
the freshman campus guards this week by not
running through the road blocks. It is hard
enough to ward off rain and Cal students with
out extra trouble from Stanford students.
