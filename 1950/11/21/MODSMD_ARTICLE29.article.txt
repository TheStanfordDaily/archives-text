### AL BERRY 
Big Game time, and a few ideas on how to make the
party-time the most successful since the money-mad
nator provided for a Romanic Languages Depart
ment.
Several ideas, I'm told, are already well underway.
All the pubs on the wonderful drinkers' row are "'<»•

to be featuring a vodka and gren- |
odine solution known as a Bear-
I U' ter. I suggest that the Stanford *
v/omi-n feature something of the
jott themselves, hut I doubt if
they will lollow my splendid ad- j
vice.
With the present somewhat
rruj'gy atmospheric conditions, the a
bonfire is going to be a problem. I

Rumors have it that Com-Com, in conjunction with the
class of '54 will present a substitute for the fire. They
will explode a depth charge underneath Lake Lag's
tranquil waters, and the lovely Nonna Deal—cleverly
disguised as a mermaid—will ride to the top of the
ensuing waterspout waving two burning pompons.
Well, it's just a rumor.
More in the concrete line of reasoning is the plan
to set up a 120-loot bar at the edge of the lake and
tell hot buttered rum and raincoats. The bonfire, if

televised, will feature the first television cameras
with automatic windshield wipers on the front. TV
viewers will think the rapidly moving black lines are
nothing but automobile static.
If Corn-Coin's depth charge doesn't work out they
had planned on being modern and using an A-bomb,
but the Russians wouldn't release the patents—we are
faced with the wettest fire in Stanford history.
The bonfire is now being constructed on a pontoon
bridge made out of upside-down fraternity canoes,
which is the customary springtime position of the fra
ternity canoes.
The Hoat parade, Friday night, should really be a
spectacle. If the rain continues —and why shouldn't it?
—I've got the greatest for a sure winner. Pop Warner
is going to be one of the judges. So? Well, you get
eleven beach umbrellas, and sail down the road m
them upside down in the pattern of a double wing
formation. Or even a single wing. You'll get Pop's
vote.
Float Judge Mrs. Sumner, an old sweetheart of
Sigma Louis, will be right at home, what with the
good old California sun coming down in water-bags.
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of their party.
See ya at the game.
