# UN and Peace Plan
## 
### 
FLUSHING, N.Y. â€” The United
Nations General Assembly today
endorsed Secretary-General Trygve
Lie's 20-year peace program after
the burly Norwegian dramatically
took the floor to deny Russian
charges that his plan was written in
Washington.
The Assembly rejected Russia's
latest "peace" package, with its key
demand that the Chinese Commu
nists be admitted to the UN.
