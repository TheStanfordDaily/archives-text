AERIAL COLLISION AFTERMATH—Charred remains of two Air Force bombers, a B-29 and a
B-50, are scattered over the desert floor after the planes collided in the air and crashed down on
the desolate Papago Indian Reservation near Tucson, Ariz. A full-scale investigation of the air
collision was launched when the 10 surviving crewmen failed to explain the crash in which 13
airmen died. —Acme Telephoto
