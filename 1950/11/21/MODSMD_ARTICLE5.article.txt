### 
LONDONâ€”Great Britain refused
today an Egyptian demand that
British troops be withdrawn from
the Suez Canal, the life-line to the
Far East where Tommies have stood
guard for 83 years.
Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin
told a cheering House of Commons
that Suez meant safety and inde
pendence for free countries around
the world and that the British gov
ernment has "no intention of taking
steps . . . which would leave the
Middle East defenseless."
