# San Francisco Bankers Hear Faville Predict Short Deflation Period Soon
## 
### 
Credit controls, materials cut
backs, and increased taxes will cre
ate a short period of deflation with
in the next few months. This rever
sal from our present "dangerously
inflationary economy" will continue
until defense expenditures can be
sizeably increased.
This was the view expressed by
David E. Faville, Stanford professor
of Marketing, who spoke yesterday
on "The Outlook for Business and
Prices" before an audience of San
Francisco bankers. The meeting
was the ninth session of a ten-lec
ture series on "Banking and Pre
paredness in 1950," sponsored by
the American Institute of Banking.
The speaker pointed out that
Regulations Wand X have already
slowed sales of real estate, automo
biles, refrigerators, and furniture.
With hiqhVr personal taxes and ris
ing prices further retarding sales,
the problem ahead for distributors
will not be "Where can we get the
product to sell?" but "Wfcere can
we find the customer?"
Professor Faville cited the excess

profits tax as "good in principle but
bad in practical application." The
aim of the tax, the speaker said, "is
to drain off excessive profits to in
dustry resulting from the war, but
it tends to undermine our economy
and is inflationary in that it encour
ages waste and extravagance.
