# Farm Blockade Run by Cal Men

### C. OSKIE BEAR 
BERKELEY, Nov. 20—It was simple enough getting onto the
Stanford campus Sunday night. El Camino to Palm Drive, via
Paly Hospital. Then we parked just above Geology Corner. About
10 frosh were standing in front of Memorial Church when we wan
dered onto Quad to reconnoiter.
I came out into the open first. Our second man was about 20

yards behind me. They stopped our
third and -last colleague.
He told them that he changed his
pants, leaving his student body card
in the old ones which were wet
from the rain.
"Well, ya got pants on now,
ain'tcha?"
True. The real scoop was that he
had just dropped his date of! at La
gunita. It's 11 o'clock—too late for
that, they argued.
"OK, hoys, I'll level with you," he
said. "I came out to bring you some
coffee and doughnuts."
Figuring he was a "wise guy," the
freshmen sent him on. The three of
us met in the center of Quad, and
thinking that maybe the guards were
suspicious, we started to run.
That did it. They were sure now,
and took up the chase. Two of us
raced into the History Building.
The third disappeared outside. We
haven't heard from him yet. And
don't know whether he was caught
and shaved, or drowned under a
bush somewhere.
I was getting worried. I whizzed
past a stairway, fell down, got up,
ran back, and climbed to the third
floor. After trying all the doors, I
hid in the remotest, darkest corridor
I could find.
Shouting voices and pounding foot
steps resounded on the first two
floors. Then they decided to search
the third. Dazed and breathing hard,
I huddled closer to the floor and
stared blankly in front of me when
three flashlights glared down at me.
"Stand up," one of the frosh or

dered, and 1 knew it was all over.
I could almost see Gloria. Swan
son's point of view as they escorted
me down the narrow stairs to the
crowd of frosh waiting below.
I felt better, though, when I saw
one of my cohorts down there, also
trapped. Rut when he began asking
if I had my student body card, what
my name was, and what I was doing,
I realized that I had been betrayed.
He told me later that he had run into
a john on the second floor, and when
he came out, nobody questioned him.
I produced a borrowed student
body card, and told them I was writ
ing a feature for the Daily. When
asked what I was doing gathering
information for a feature of the His
tory Building at 11 o'clock at night
by sitting in a dark corner, I ex
plained that the article was to be on
the campus guard.
When they got me hack to my
car, they wanted to know why there
was no sticker on it. I explained
that the car really belonged to my
sister who lived in Menlo . . . yes,
it was registered under my father's

j even so, we smugly noticed, as guards
I waved us through the blockade, that
j they had moved it to cover the Paly
Hospital road too late.

name ... no, not mv step-father ,
. . . no, there was no registration
card because it was an Illinois car.
After finding no paint in the trunk, '
they decided to make one last test
and take me up to the Daily Shack
to be identified. There was some
blond babe there, and I whispered
something sweet into her ear. She
laughed, but swore that she had
never seen me before, and that I
didn't work on the Daily.
By this time the freshmen were
convinced that I \vas a Stanford man.
They refused to give their names for
my story, preferring to remain "un
sung heroes of the campus guard."
My traitor pal, who had been in
on all the proceedings and had asked
me more questions than the rest, re
mained behind. Our unopened paint
cans rattled under the back seat as
we drove down Palm Drive. But

After finding no paint in the trunk, '
they decided to make one last test
and take me up to the Daily Shack
to be identified. There was some
blond babe there, and I whispered
something sweet into her ear. She
laughed, but swore that she had
never seen me before, and that I
didn't work on the Daily.
By this time the freshmen were
convinced that I \vas a Stanford man.
They refused to give their names for
my story, preferring to remain "un
sung heroes of the campus guard."
My traitor pal, who had been in

me more questions than the rest, re

cans rattled under the back seat as
we drove down Palm Drive. But
BERKELEY, Nov. 20—It was simple enough getting onto the
Stanford campus Sunday night. El Camino to Palm Drive, via
Paly Hospital. Then we parked just above Geology Corner. About
10 frosh were standing in front of Memorial Church when we wan
dered onto Quad to reconnoiter.
I came out into the open first. Our second man was about 20

yards behind me. They stopped our
third and -last colleague.
He told them that he changed his
pants, leaving his student body card
in the old ones which were wet
from the rain.
"Well, ya got pants on now,
ain'tcha?"
True. The real scoop was that he
had just dropped his date of! at La
gunita. It's 11 o'clock—too late for
that, they argued.
"OK, hoys, I'll level with you," he
said. "I came out to bring you some
coffee and doughnuts."
Figuring he was a "wise guy," the
freshmen sent him on. The three of
us met in the center of Quad, and
thinking that maybe the guards were
suspicious, we started to run.
That did it. They were sure now,
and took up the chase. Two of us
raced into the History Building.
The third disappeared outside. We
haven't heard from him yet. And
don't know whether he was caught
and shaved, or drowned under a
bush somewhere.
I was getting worried. I whizzed
past a stairway, fell down, got up,
ran back, and climbed to the third
floor. After trying all the doors, I
hid in the remotest, darkest corridor
I could find.
Shouting voices and pounding foot
steps resounded on the first two
floors. Then they decided to search
the third. Dazed and breathing hard,
I huddled closer to the floor and
stared blankly in front of me when
three flashlights glared down at me.
"Stand up," one of the frosh or

dered, and 1 knew it was all over.
I could almost see Gloria. Swan
son's point of view as they escorted
me down the narrow stairs to the
crowd of frosh waiting below.
I felt better, though, when I saw
one of my cohorts down there, also
trapped. Rut when he began asking
if I had my student body card, what
my name was, and what I was doing,
I realized that I had been betrayed.
He told me later that he had run into
a john on the second floor, and when
he came out, nobody questioned him.
I produced a borrowed student
body card, and told them I was writ
ing a feature for the Daily. When
asked what I was doing gathering
information for a feature of the His
tory Building at 11 o'clock at night
by sitting in a dark corner, I ex
plained that the article was to be on
the campus guard.
