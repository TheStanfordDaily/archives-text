# Russian Lies Exposed in Slanderous Cartoons
## Red Press Prejudiced 
### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
(The following feature is written
and coinpiled by former Daily stall
writer, George Velliotes. It is one
of the results of a year's research
in the Hoover Library files on Sov
iet visual propaganda.—lid.)
Russia has a diamond which
the Kremlin hopes will dazzle
the onlooking world with its
brilliance. But, there is a catch
to this diamond, it is a zircon—
phoney to the core.
This rotten stone of falsification is
called by the Politburo "truth." It is
one of Communism's chief weapons in
today's shuddering political world
wherein a police state displays its
marijuana of "peace."
The zircon has many facets: on
one is mirrored Stalin's interviews
with Americans stating his love of
peace was greater than for his adu
lation in his press.
On another facet we see the Rus
sians in the UN stating support of
atomic energy controls with nothing
else to show than the hot air ex
panded in the statement.
On another facet we see Vishinsky
answering questions indicating that
the Kremlin was ready to play ball
for the full nine innings. On other
facets we see the Ked leaders' state
ments on the "peaceful co-habita
tion" theme.
But even a zircon has a bottom to
its setting. There, with its base in
side the USSR, if one takes the
trouble—the painful trouble — to
look, we see the true long-range
thinking of the Kremlinites. These
facets are dull and dirty and mo
notonously vapid in the eyes of
truth.
Note the examples, below, of Soviet
propaganda to the Russian people and
to other foreign Cornumnists; ex
amples told in print, on the ether,
and in drawings. (These have been
selected out bf the Hoover Library's
collection of thousands of examples
of anti-American Soviet visual pro
paganda items.)
No phase of American life is too
obscure to vilify in the Russian press.
Such procedure, even to the obdurate
mind, seems too extreme for just a ro
bust demonstration of ideological
competition and fervor.
In plain Americanese, the Red
Bosses are moving their people to
"hate our guts."
This propaganda, in its totality, in
dicates frank, sardonic, willful, mur
derous, long-range intent towards a
whole cultural civilization —ours.
