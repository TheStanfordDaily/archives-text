# Bruins vs. USC; Sanders Shears Al Carmichael
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20 (UP)~
University of Southern California's
fast - improving football team will
provide UCLA with its toughest op
ponent of the season, Coach Henry
R. (Red) Sanders said today.
UCLA has lost only two con
ference games, to California and
Washington, and Southern Califor
nia has won only one, against Ore
gon. But Sanders said the game the
Trojans played against Washington
last Saturday was the tipoff on
Southern California's strength.
"1 never saw backs run better
than Jim Sears and Al Carmichael,'
Sanders said. "And that Harold
Hatfield is one of the best ends in
the business."
Sanders [jointed out to Southern
California football writers that he
still was forced to depend upon a
fourth - string sophomore tailback, j
Ted Narleski, because of injuries to |
others ahead of him in that key
position.
Coach Jeff Cravath said that aside
from mistakes his players made
against Washington he was pleased I
with their performance. With the !
Bruins and Trojans both injured at
fullback, Cravath suggested the i
possibility that both teams play ten
men.
Southern California also is hard !
hit in it:; defensive halfback posi
tions, Cravath said, because both j
Frank Gifford and Dean Schneider ;
were injured Saturday.
Cravath disclosed that Washing
ton's failure to change its defense {
all year gave his team an early ad- j
vantage last Saturday until Husky
Coach Howie Odell made a quick ■
shift in defensive tactics.
Coach Jordan Olivar, whose Loy- j
ola Lions meet Santa Clara Satur- ;
day, quipped that Bronco coaches j
have a clause in their contracts that j
they have to upset one team each !
year and this year his squad ap- !
peared to be the victim.
He pointed out that Santa Clara, j
despite its won-lost record, has not j
looked bad in a single game and [
was a versatile club that could be
expected to come up with unusual
formations.
Undefeated Loyola, however, has '
beaten Santa Clara only once in the j
14 times they met and the Lions j
were expected to be high for the
game, Olivar agreed.
