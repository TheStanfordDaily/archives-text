Stanford's football practice yester
day consisted of "mental prepara
tion" for this Saturday's Big Game. I
The Card gridders saw movies of
lit Army game, listened to chalk j
talks, and reviewed Marehie j
Schwartz's thorough scout reports on j
Cal. Stanford has scouted every I
Bear game this year.
Luckily, the Indians didn't incur
any lasting injuries from Army's
rough gridders. Quarterback Gary
Kerkorian received a hip pointer, but
is okay now. Bob Griffin, with the
same ailment, should also be ready
for the Bears. Joe St. Geme, defen
sive halfback, was shaken up in the

Army tussle, but will be in top shape
Saturday.
Bob Brynn, who went at partial
efficiency against Army, will have his
full speed against Cal. Likewise,
Eric Southwood, the long-ailing half
back, who starred in the Cal game
last year.
Tackle Dick Gaedtke, who missed
the Army encounter with a bad knee,
will also be on hand for the Big one.
r fhe only doubtful participant is
Bruce Van Alstyne, the ailing end.
Schwartz has still to receive the
neurologist's report on Van Alstyne's
bad arm.
