## Dutch Says Cal is Best 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20 (UP)—
Assistant Coach Dutch Fehring of
Stanford, who has scouted University
of California all season, today said
the Bears have been the "best team
j I ever saw."
As Stanford's Indians prepared to
mett California in their annual "Big
Game" before 81,000 in Berkeley
Saturday, Fehring reported to Head
; Couch Marchie Schwartz that Cali
fornia was "great."
"This California team has the best
defensive I've seen," Fehring re
ported. "It probably has the best
safety man in the country in Carl
1 Van Heuit; and the three backs,
Johnny Olszewski, Jim Monachino,
und Pete Schabarum make the best
' all-around threesome in a backfield
' in the country."
Schwartz pointed out that Fehring
! hasn't seen all the teams in the coun
try, but that usually he is quite con
i servative in his scouting reports.
"I do know," said the head coach,
: "that California has the best all
j around football team we've faced in
my 10 years on the West Coast.
"The Bears have depth; they are
[ steady; they get dependable, not
j flashy, quarterbacking from Jim Ma-
J rinos; their rushing offense is sound;
; and their backs can go straight
J ahead up the middle or around the
| ends with equal excellence.
"Fehring told me that nearly every
game California has won this year
has been on brute strength—nothing
fancy," said Schwartz.
However, he didn't give up on the
game. This traditional is always a
close contest and on the basis of the
Stanford showing against Army last
Saturday the Bears, despite an un
defeated record, will be bare fa
j vorites.
"We were at the highest emotional
pitch I've ever seen for the Army
game, and that 7 to 0 loss didn't hurt
J our morale," said Schwartz.
"Army has a tremendous team and
our fellows had been talking about
I winning that one since 'way last
spring.
"It may be that we'll have a hard
time getting as 'high' again for the
California game, but we'll be in good
physical condition."
