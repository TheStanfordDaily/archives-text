# Best Bet; Bears Against Illini in Rose Bowl Classic
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 19 (UP)
—Two big "ifs" were all that stood
in the way today of California and
Illinois meeting in the annual Rose
Bowl classic in Pasadena on New
Year's Day.
While the big bad Bears of Cali
fornia rolled along to their ninth j
straight triumph ol the season Sat- |
urday with a close 13-7 win over
the University of San Francisco, Il
linois got into No. 1 spot in the
Big Ten bowl battle by upsetting
favored Ohio State, 14-7.
Those victories, pieced together,
made the Bowl picture like this:
1. California still must defeat
Stanford on Saturday to get to Pas- i
adena for the third year in a row. j
A defeat for Cal in this game prob
ably would result in Washington,
loser only to the Bears inside the
conference, going to the Bowl, be
cause California has be«'n there the

last two holidays. Stanford looked
very tough in bowing to unbeaten
Army, 7-0, and easily could provide
the upset. Washington must beat
Washington State in the finale to
keep its chances alive.
2. Illinois has to get by thrice
beaten but still rug feu Northwest
ern. The Illini, having lost only to
Wisconsin (C-7) this year, would
win the Bowl bid because Ohio
State, which also has lost only one
Big Ten game, is ineligible because
it played in the Bowl last year.
Another posibility is that, if Illinois
loses to Northwestern and Wiscon
sin beats Minnesota, the Badgers
may win the bid because of having
played more Big Ten games.
However, both Illinois and Cali
fornia will be heavy favorites to
make the Bowl—and if they meet,
the game certainly will rate as a
toss-up. California is working on

a string of nine straight wins this
season and 33 in a row in regular
season play. Their only defeats in
three years have been in the New
Year's classic.
California, in the Bowl for the
194!i and 19T»U games, was beaten re
spectively by Northwestern, 2'J-14
and Ohio State, 17-14.
The last time Illinois came to the
Bowl, on New Year's Day, 1i)47, it
administered a 45-14 shellacking to
UCLA.
Since signing the Pacific Coasv :
Conference-Big Ten Bowl pact, the
PCC hasn't won a game and this is
the last year of the contract.
Illinois already has beaten two
representative PCC clubs this sea
son UCLA, 14-U; and Washington,
20-13. California also whipped these
two teams, thumping UCLA, 35-0, l
and ekini* out a 14-7 win over the !
Huskies.
