# Farm AUC Pleads For Atlantic Union Now To Avoid War
## 
### WALT MENNINGER 
On campus today, 20 students are
forwarding the idea that in order
to prevent World War HI, the ftee
peoples of the original Atlantic Pact
nations should form a federal un
ion, an Atlantic Union.
These students, members of the i
Stanford chapter of the Atlantic
Union Committee, are working to- I
ward this goal by publicizing the
aims and purposes of Atlantic Un
ion.
The chapter plans to bring to
Stanford this year such speakers as
U.S. Senator Estes Kefauvcr of
Tennessee, Congresswoman PMrn
Gahagan Douglas, and Herbert
Agar, statesman and writer.
"Other elements of tne local
education program," said Cynthia
Troxcll, acting chairman, "include
future panel discussions, similar to
one held last spring, and the main
tenance ol a booth at the Pavi'ion
on registration days. A student de
bate on Atlantic Union is also under
consideration."
The secondary aim of the Stan
ford chapter, which was formed last
May 10, is to write to Congressional
representatives urging passage of a
resolution now in committee re
questing the President to call a
convention of the representative
nations to explore the possibilities
of forming a Union.
"The representative nations," ex
plained Miss Troxell, "would in
clude those free peoples who de
sire membership and have demo

cratic governments, such us Aus- i
tialia, New Zealand, and Switzer
land, besides the original Atlantic I
Pact nations."
The proponents declare that the I _
proposed Union would prove both I
militarily and economically benefi- j
cial to all the nations involved, as j
it would consolijate the Western I
bloc.
Since itn fourffling last spring, the 1
Stanford chapter has doubled its I
original membership and co-oper- |
ated with the Palo Alto chapter, 1
headed by Eliot Black welder, emer- '
itus professor of geology.
Among the student members are
Derek Bok, head sponsor of Encins j
Hall; David Elliott, student mana- I
ger; Chuck Getchell, senior class |
president; Kay Wold, Poble spon
sor; and Bud Lake, summer quarter
student manager.
Inturcsted students may contact I
Miss Troxell at Lagunita, or write
the Atlantic Union Committee, |
; Stanford Chapter, (>B4 Mirada Ave- j
nue, Campus, for further informa- I
i tion.
