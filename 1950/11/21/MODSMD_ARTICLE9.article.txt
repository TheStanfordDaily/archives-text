# TUESDAY SERIES
## Bolander To Narrate Own Movie 
### 
A hobby in photography has de
veloped a wide knowledge of the po
litical and social environments of
North American, European, and Af
rican countries for Dr. Lewis Bolan
der, speaker on the Tuesday Evening
Series program tonight at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Dr. Bolander, who is head physi
cian at a hospital and clinic in Van
Nuys, will narrate a film, taken en
tirely by himself, entitled "From
Savage Medicine to Historic Shrines."
In pursuing his hobby, the doctor
has traveled widely over the world,
including trips through France, Swe
den, Mexico, South Africa, Egypt,
and the Holy Land.
Many of the pictures of the life in
African native villages to be shown
tonight were taken by Dr. Bolander
a year ago in Nigeria. At that time he
was in charge of a missionary hos
pital during his two months' summer
vacation while the resident physician
was on leave.
Included in the film are shots of
the United Nations Headquarters at
Lake Success, New York; Westmin
ster Abbey in England; and Victoria
Falls in South Africa.
