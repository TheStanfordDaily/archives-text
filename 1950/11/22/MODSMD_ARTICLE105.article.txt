# Time to Win--Big Game
## 
### JOY HAAS 
And then it's tim 3 BIG
GAME!
Tho cl ; max to weeks of talk,
thought, pi mini lg, v/oiry, and
laughs.
It's the battle of the Ax ', and t he
Axe Yell, of corsages, anfl pompons,
of two teams playing their hearts
out, while their fans yell themselves
hoarse. It's a great day!
The theme of this year's Big Game
card stunts is "In The Cards." The
symbolic playing dcck will feature
the Indian as Ace, Marchie as the
trump, the bid is the Rose Bowl, the
A?:e is the stake, and the score is
anybody's guess; but Rally Com has
devised a way to ila.sh the hall-time
score.
Half-Time Score
The worm n'.s section will serve as
•n ei')'• r ;it"d crrd section, and the
big red locomotive, with Li'l Injun at
inc lurottic, wiii ;i ovo :ic i 'o<s both
sections with vocal "choo-choo"
sound eflccts.
(' tn bas decided to chop the
traditional tree out of the block "S,"
and instead wi!l outline it with root
ers' caps.
To sit in the cheering section, in
addition to tickets, men will be re
quired to wear rooters' caps, and
wemen must have pompons and wear
red feathers. All students should
wear white.
Batons, Music
Aleng with the colorful activities
of the two rooting sections, card
stunts, and the Big Game itself will
be the flashing of batons and brilliant
uniforms of tho two marching bands.
Stanford's 88-piece marching band,
clad in cardinal military uniforms,
will tell a gridiron story of tho holi
days of the year. Seven intricate
stunts ending with the Thanksgiving
"turkey finale"' have been prepared
by Jack Blumberg, band manager,
and the fast stepping bandsmen.
