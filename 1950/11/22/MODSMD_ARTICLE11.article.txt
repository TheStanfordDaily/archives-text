### DWIGHT WILBUR Daily Sports Editor 
Kor the fourth consecutive year, Stanford's upset-minded gridders will assume the much sought
after underdog's role when they crash headon with California 3 undefeated hsar.s oaiurday at 1.30
in tlio 53rd annual "Big Game.''
More than 00,000 partisan gridiron fans will pack every corner of California's huge Memorial
Stadium to see Coach Pappy Waldorf's Bowl-bound Bears battle Coach Marchie Schwartz's deter
mined Indians, who are rated two-touchdown underdogs. _ _

And unless the weatherman makes a sudden about face, 1o j
answer th° prayers of both Marchie and Pappy, the two teams are
scheduled lo pl*y on a waier-soaked Berkeley turf.
According to latest reports, the Memorial Stadium field will re
quire at least two full days of sunshine in order to be in good
shap" for the ensuing Big Game battle.
Whethei the wet turf will hinder the hard-driving Bears more;
than tlio pa;;s-minded Indians is a question that the football ex
perls" have been baiting around all work.
In tho Stanford Stadium mire lar-t week, an inspired Indian de j
Icnnive line hold a powerful Army team to a mere 102 yards net
in the air and on the ground.
But the Cards never did get to show th«> 40,000 drenched on
lookers their planned aerial show, which was all but inuDorsible
to put en because of the muddy field. w
On llir California side of the ledger, the Bears' highly regarded
• ffenne seemed to be boqged down considerably by the slow
Beikeley turf and the Waldorf crew could muster but two touch
downs against a lowly-regarded USF eleven.
Previously, on dry turfs, the Bears rolled over 3uch formidable
able opponents as UCLA, Washington, and Pennsylvania.
Coming into the Big Game. Stanford will be supporting a 5 3 1
record, n mark which has left the Indians in a tie v.'ith Washington
