# The 						Double Celebration
## 
### 
It is seldom thkt Stanford students can cele
brate Thanksgiving and Big Game on the same
weekend. At first glance they seem like to
tally unrelated occasions. But perhaps there is
a correlation between them.
Thanksgiving has always been billed as a
flay on which people throughout the nation
give thanks. It may be even more than that. It
may be a time for confused people to stop and
collect their thoughts or for always-busy stu
dents to pause and analyze their own Stanford
family.
During the years, an education at Stanford
has represented years of planning and saving
for many students. For their families it may
have meant a few sacrifices.
And for Stanford it's meant the growth of a
spirit which will always be famous and for
which all its students and alumni will be thank
ful.
They'll sense this feeling as they go to the
game Saturday; they'll sense it tomorrow as
they celebrate Thanksgiving.
Members of this University community ewe
mere than thankfulness. For as we said, there
is a need for all of us to slow down a minute
and carry our share of loyalty, faith, and re

sponsibility which have traditionally been
ours.
Dissension is inevitable within any group of
people. Although the atmosphere has been
clouded with an unsuccessful charity drive, op
position to a coaching contract, and protests
against student government, it seems likely
that some cooling breeze may relieve the situa
tion.
To us, that relief comes in the form of a joint
Thanksgiving and Big Gameâ€”a chance to re
live again the Stanford Spirit.
