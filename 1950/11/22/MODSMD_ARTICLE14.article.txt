# Our Biggest Pictorial
## 
### 
Today's 16-page Daily is the largest pictorial
Big Game edition in the 51-year history of the
paper. The picture features have been made
possible by The Daily's Fairchild engraving
machine which enables members of the staff to
engrave photographs as soon as they come out
of the photographer's dark room.
With a Big Game Daily in hand, a delicious
turkey dinner under our belts, and Stanford
spirit in our minds and hearts, we'll meet you
on the Cal side of the field Saturday to help
carry home The Axeâ€”Stanford's own.
