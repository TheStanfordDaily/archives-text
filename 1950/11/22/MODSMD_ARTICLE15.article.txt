### VIC PALMIERI 
'Twas the night before Big Game, and all through
the lair,
Not a creature was stirring, not one little bear.
The team was all nestled all sung in their beds,
While visions of roses danced in their heads.
An Pappy gave his staff a chance for a nap, *
Because victory, he figured, was right in his lap.
When all of a sudden on the roof came a patter,
Which Pappy heard and stopped growing fatter,
For to his ears there can s a refrain,
That spelled the arrival of more damn rain.
"Gad!"' yelled Pappy, his face all ruddy,
"Stanford's a terror when the going is muddy!"

Away to the phone he proceeded to lumber
And quick as a Hash dialed the number,
"Quick men!" he shouted, "sound the alarm,
"Call Richter, Monachino, and Schabarum!
"Wake Marinos, wake Laster, wake Van Huit . . .
Hurry, by God, or I swear you'll rue it!"
Now what happened afterward, I leave to your brain,
The point is that Pappy is scared of the rain.
For both he and Blaik nearly lost their busties,
In last week's grubby little tussles.
So pray for the storm, pray for the wet . . .
And know there's hope for the Big Red yet.
