# The
						Parking Problem -- Good Luck
## 
### 
When Farm rooters roll their ja- i
lopies into Beartown this Saturday :
they can expect to find a parking
situation which is not only deplor
able but which will be wholly for
< in to them after their experiences
in the tire-worn tree-covered ex- j
pauses of Senator Stanford's Acres.
Unless conditions have changed
immeasureably since the Cal-UCLA 1
fiasco of week before last, Reds' '
proMtm will be twofold: (1) to find
a : pot along the street unhauntcd by
I < ncil-happy, ticket-passing law
hawks, or (2) to find a vacant lot or
back yard where the fee is com
parable to that for an evening's fes
tivities at the Fairmont.
The California Memorial Stadium

I is situated above and to the right of
the campus in a neighborhood where
' most of the fraternities, sororities,
i and living groups are located. No
; where has there been any allowance
for a public parking area, and due
I to the high concentration of resident
autos in the vicinity there is little
: chance for out-of-town patrons to
I have a parking place along a public
thoroughfare.
As early as 11:30 a.m. it was diffi
| cult to find a legal parking place
within seven blocks of the Berkeley
' oval on the day of the aforementioned
Bruin affair. A great many places
that are potential slots have the time
limit posted because they are nearly
into ths shopping area.
The alternative to street parking is

to submit one's fenders to be crushed
in a private baci; yard or vacant lot
for a liberal sum. For these places
the vulture-like citizens have been
bringing in $2.50 this year at loca
tions up to five blocks away. Antes
h;ive been as high as five dollars in
J the shadow of the towl.
By way of comparison, at the Coli
eum this season, 50-cent places can
be hatl two or three blocks from the
scene, and there are vt-ry few going
fcr less than 75 cents or a dollar.
1 be always crowded driving condi
tion.". Ac ross trie Bay Bridge and along
the Eastshore, of course, are worse
on game days. So the most desirable
course is to get there early this
Saturday.
