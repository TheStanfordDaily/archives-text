# 'Quake Relic Stars in Utah
## 
### 
A relic of the 15)00 earthquake at
Stanford made news on the Utah
State College campus at Logan,
Utah, this month by appearing in
the dramatic presentation of Ferenc
Molnar's "Liliom."
The relic was the head of the
apostle Paul, once part of a statue
which stood in the apse of Memorial
Church. This statue, like several
others in the church, was damaged
when the quake shook it off its
pedestal.
A Palo Alto monument builder
salvaged several of the broken
marble statues for use as grave
stones. The head was never used
for this purpose, however, and
when the monument builder died
his wife gave St. Paul to an em
ployee, Nephi J. Bott.
Bott moved to Utah several years
later, taking it with him. For a time
it was used in various activities,
often for Halloween stunts. Later
it was given to the art department
at Utah State.
Here a student, Ruben Reynolds,
found it while seeking for a
scene depicting paradise for the
play. Reynolds photographed the
statue and reproduced it as a slide.
Don Marshall, a writer for the Utah
State Student Life, the campus
newspaper, traced the history of the
marble St. Paul back to the Stan
ford Memorial Church.
