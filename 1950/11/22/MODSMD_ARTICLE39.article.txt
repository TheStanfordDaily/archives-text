THE SAFETY VALVE—AII the work doesn't lie in building the
bonfire. This is also the season for the Berkeleyite raiders. With
scout cars likes this one manned by Bob Volk, Bruce Blake, and
Clarke Nelson, the Farm protects its bonfire. Last year more thrin
six Cal students were caught, and their heads shaved in the
Encina lounge. Weapons like this baseball bat are seldom
brought into use. —Daily photo by Don Dapelo
