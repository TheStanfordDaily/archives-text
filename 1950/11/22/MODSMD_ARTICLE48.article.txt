# Unbeaten Card JV's Play Cal
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's undefeated Braves take
to the war path again Saturday
when they gallop herd into Berke
ley Memorial Stadium to meet a
high-riding California squad in the
10:30 a.m. preliminary to the "Big
Go."
The Braves bring with them a
record of five scalps and no de
feats. To. counter the Baby Bears
boast a four-win, one-loss seasonal
record. However, the teams' rec
ords are difficult to compare be
cause of the diversity of the two
schedules.
Against the one opponent the
teams have played in common, the
Presidio of San Francisco, the Ram
blers rate the game edge on the
basis of their impressive 67 to 0
trouncing of the Army men. In
comparison, Stanford splashed over
the Presidio 14 to 0 last Saturday.
Actually these scores mean nothing
due to the difference in weather
when the games were played.
Team Records
The Ramblers have trounced the
Presidio, Yuba College, Navy Sub

Rase, and Alameda NAS. Their
only loss was to the Airpacs. The
locals on the other hand have
waltzed through the Cal Aggies, Cal
Poly, Treasure Island, S.F. State JV,
and the Presidio.
The Braves, after absorbing var
sity blows for two months, are up
and waiting for their turn to go on
the"of Tense." There is no doubt
that the junior varsity has gained
valuable experience from its daily
offensive and defensive scrimmages
with the "big boys."
Brave Coach Max Kimberly, for
mer head line coach of Michigan
State, announced the following
opening lineup: ends, Jack Lauder
baugh and Fred Nelson; tackles,
Don Lucas and Whitcy Pyle;
guards, Dick Borda and Don Muel
ler; center, Bill Barnes. In the back
field will be Steve Mitchell at
quarterback, Bob French and Scot
ty McKay at the halfs, and Paul
Warner at fullback. Guards How
ard Standerfer and Bill Ford will
see only limited action due to in
juries.
Prospccts for next year's Stanford

| varsity are numerous but Kimberly
especially singles out the following
to watch in Saturday's struggle: 1
Pyle, Borda, Nelson, and French.
McKay has some varsity ball under |
| his belt already.

Due to the climatic conditions,
the Brave - Rambler preliminary,
originally scheduled for Berkeley
Memorial Stadium at 10:30 a.m.,
may be canceled, postponed, or
switched to another field.

Under the coaching of "Zeb"
! Chaney, the Ramblers arc a well
| coached, big, fast, powerful squad.
1 The Ramblers' starting eleven is
| yet unnamed and depends upon the !
| men the Bear varsity presses into
■ action.
"Going after an undefeated sea
son Saturday, the boys should look
the part of a good football team,"
Kimberly said, adding, "However,
! the Ramblers are a fine, co-ordi
nated ball club, and the game looks
to be a toss-up. Defense is the
strongest part of our game, but
with the determination the boys |

( have shown our offense should go."
Braves Win East Two
Similar to the varsity games, the
JV struggles have had their share
of upsets and thrillers. In the past
two seasons the Braves have upset
the Ramblers. Last year an early
game crowd saw Stanford come
from behind to whip the Berkeley
Boys 33 to 27 in the final two min
utes. The year before it was th?
same story but the stage was Ber
| keley.
Now it is 1050, and the squads will
be going at it again on Memorial
Stadium's carpet turf Saturday in
the lid-lifter to the Big One.
Take your pick as to the winner.
From here it looks like a toss-up.
but the witch-doctor tolls us that
i the Braves will bring their sixth
scalp back to the reservation by
seven points.
In five games played by each
team this year, the Braves have to
taled 11C and the Ramblers IS 8.
Forty-five points have been tallied
against the Red while 39 have been
pushed over against the Blue and
Gold.

Similar to the varsity games, the
JV struggles have had their share
of upsets and thrillers. In the past
two seasons the Braves have upset
the Ramblers. Last year an early
game crowd saw Stanford come
from behind to whip the Berkeley
Boys 33 to 27 in the final two min

same story but the stage was Ber

Now it is 1050, and the squads will

Forty-five points have been tallied
