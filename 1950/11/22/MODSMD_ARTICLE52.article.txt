# This Frosh Gang Beat Cal
## HELP FOR MARCHIE Gant, Garrett, Cook Lead Papoose Varsity Aspirants 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's U'liO frosh football team
followed the example of its last three
predecessors by winning the PCC
Southern Division championship. As
has hi en the case the last three years,
the l!). r >o yearling team will present
several players of championship cali
ber for varsity inspection next year.
One of those considered most- j
likely to-succeed is tackle Dick
(.hint, a 200-pounder from Covina.
; Gant, who should grow by next fall,
I is unlike most tackles in that he is
j agile and very quick reacting. Frosh
coach Bob Ghilotti predicts that he
| will break in on the starting lineup
j next fall.
Other tackles who have a chance
: of breaking in ail' Barry Smith and
Hon Buffi (defensive) and Don Har
! court (offensive).
Garrett Top Passer
The most highly-touted prospect
I on the Papoose team this year was
quarter! nek Bob Garrett, selected on
the All-American prep team. Gar
rett was such a flash in high school
that Pasadena sports editor Rube
Samuelson tabbed him as the best
Southland propspect since Army's
Glenn Davis and Cal's John Ols
zewski.
Garrett has lived up to his notices
as far as passing and defense are con
cerned. His passing, both long and
short, has been beautiful to behold.
Also, lie has consistently booted kicks
lor 40 yards or more. He still needs
work on bail handling and field gen- i
eralship, but he has the potential.
Since Gary Kerkorian and Dick I

Horn will have the quarterback job
sewed up next year, Marchie
Schwartz hinted that Garrett may be
utilized as a defensive man.
Cook Power Kit tint r
The top running back on the frosh
team was Ron Cook, a 170-pound
power runner from Redondo Beach.
Cook is a runner of the Boyd Ben
son type, powerful and hard to bring
down. He definitely should fit into
Schwartz's plans next year.
Marshall Howe and Captain F.d
Tanner were tops as linebackers this
year, and should help to fill the ele
phant-sized hole left by the gradua
tion of Russ Pomeroy.
Diek Steele should be tops as an
offensive center and that goes for
Larry Wabster at guard. Guards
Frank Druhan and Jim Ward are
only a step behind.
Steinberg, Morley Lead Ends
End Coach Ken Rose has tutored
four top ends in John Steinberg, Dud
Hersehback, Sam Morley, and Tom
Howell. Steinberg and Herschback
are the defensive specialists, and the
former has been a whiz at throwing
enemy quarterbacks for sizeable
losses.
Morley has great natural ability in
pass-snagging while Howell is very
astute in knowing what to do after
he has caught the porker. Both need
practice in downfield blocking.
Besides Cook, halfbacks John Gil
more, Hank Guillen, Frank Tene
rello, and Bill Scheidccker bear
watching. The first three are scat
backs, while Scheidecker is an ideal

right hull big, strung, fast, and good
on defense.
Collins One for Shift
Quarterback Doug Collins was
overshadowed by Garrett at times,
but he should find some use on the
varsity. He may play defense or he
may shift to halfback. A halfback
who can pass is always useful.
Don Day, a good blocker and power
runner, and Pete Larmer are the top
frosh prospects for future varsity
fullback duty.
Other froshers who may help out
are half Bud Coon, lull Bill Ander
son, center Tom Allen, guard Bob
Armstrong, center Eric Mack, center
Jack McKenna, and tackle Andy
Thompson.

No little bit of the Golden Bears'
success on the gridiron can probably
be attributed to their fine practice
facilities. At C;il the football team
practices on a field equipped with
lights for afterdai'k workouts and
big enough for three concurrent game
style scrimmages.

losses.
Morley has great natural ability in
pass-snagging while Howell is very
astute in knowing what to do after
he has caught the porker. Both need
practice in downfield blocking.
Besides Cook, halfbacks John Gil
more, Hank Guillen, Frank Tene
rello, and Bill Scheidccker bear
watching. The first three are scat
backs, while Scheidecker is an ideal

right hull big, strung, fast, and good
on defense.
Collins One for Shift
Quarterback Doug Collins was
overshadowed by Garrett at times,
but he should find some use on the
varsity. He may play defense or he
may shift to halfback. A halfback
who can pass is always useful.
Don Day, a good blocker and power
runner, and Pete Larmer are the top
frosh prospects for future varsity
fullback duty.
Other froshers who may help out
are half Bud Coon, lull Bill Ander
son, center Tom Allen, guard Bob
Armstrong, center Eric Mack, center
Jack McKenna, and tackle Andy
Thompson.

No little bit of the Golden Bears'
success on the gridiron can probably
be attributed to their fine practice
facilities. At C;il the football team
practices on a field equipped with
lights for afterdai'k workouts and
big enough for three concurrent game
style scrimmages.

Stanford's U'liO frosh football team
followed the example of its last three
predecessors by winning the PCC
Southern Division championship. As
has hi en the case the last three years,
the l!). r >o yearling team will present
several players of championship cali
ber for varsity inspection next year.
One of those considered most- j
likely to-succeed is tackle Dick
(.hint, a 200-pounder from Covina.
; Gant, who should grow by next fall,
I is unlike most tackles in that he is
j agile and very quick reacting. Frosh
coach Bob Ghilotti predicts that he
| will break in on the starting lineup
j next fall.
Other tackles who have a chance
: of breaking in ail' Barry Smith and
Hon Buffi (defensive) and Don Har
! court (offensive).
Garrett Top Passer
The most highly-touted prospect
I on the Papoose team this year was
quarter! nek Bob Garrett, selected on
the All-American prep team. Gar
rett was such a flash in high school
that Pasadena sports editor Rube
Samuelson tabbed him as the best
Southland propspect since Army's
Glenn Davis and Cal's John Ols
zewski.
Garrett has lived up to his notices
as far as passing and defense are con
cerned. His passing, both long and
short, has been beautiful to behold.
Also, lie has consistently booted kicks
lor 40 yards or more. He still needs
work on bail handling and field gen- i
eralship, but he has the potential.
Since Gary Kerkorian and Dick I

Horn will have the quarterback job
sewed up next year, Marchie
Schwartz hinted that Garrett may be
utilized as a defensive man.
Cook Power Kit tint r
The top running back on the frosh
team was Ron Cook, a 170-pound
power runner from Redondo Beach.
Cook is a runner of the Boyd Ben
son type, powerful and hard to bring
down. He definitely should fit into
Schwartz's plans next year.
Marshall Howe and Captain F.d
Tanner were tops as linebackers this
year, and should help to fill the ele
phant-sized hole left by the gradua
tion of Russ Pomeroy.
Diek Steele should be tops as an
offensive center and that goes for
Larry Wabster at guard. Guards
Frank Druhan and Jim Ward are
only a step behind.
Steinberg, Morley Lead Ends
End Coach Ken Rose has tutored
four top ends in John Steinberg, Dud
Hersehback, Sam Morley, and Tom
Howell. Steinberg and Herschback
are the defensive specialists, and the
former has been a whiz at throwing
enemy quarterbacks for sizeable
losses.
Morley has great natural ability in
pass-snagging while Howell is very
astute in knowing what to do after
he has caught the porker. Both need
practice in downfield blocking.
Besides Cook, halfbacks John Gil
more, Hank Guillen, Frank Tene
