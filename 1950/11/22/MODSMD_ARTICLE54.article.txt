## USF Battle Washed Out 
### 
A soggy field lias caused the soc
cer game between USF and Stan
ford, scheduled for tonight in the
City, to be postponed indefinitely.
In a telephone conference yes
terday between Coach Graham of
Stanford and the USF coach, the
latter reported his field unusable,
and it was decided to postpone the
contest. A new date, however, was
not set.
Stanford is still scheduled to
tackle California's Golden Bear:; in
its Big Game Saturday morning at
10 on the Bear field. Unless there is
more rain, the field should be dry
enough to play on by. Saturday.
Stanford must come through
against Cal Saturday to keep alive
its hopes of beating them out for
second place. The Bears hold an
early - season victory over the
Cards, coming through in the last
few minutes of the game to eke out
a 4 to 3 victory.
But the Cards, who seem to have
finally found themselves, winning
two of their last three games after
a three-game losing streak, stand
better than an even chance of
whipping the Bears in this outing.
Coach Graham has brought his
charges along very well. He found
himself equipped with a good goal
ie, Dick Bishop, who learned his
soccer in England.
