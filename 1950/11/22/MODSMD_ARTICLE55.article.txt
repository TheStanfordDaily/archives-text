ABKAIIAM 213 (1-2 C <1-1 2(10 HARRIS
Abraham, once a good Card linebacker, has heen reduced to olVensixe
action only due to a knee injury. Almost perfect as a center, Abraham has
been restricted in his blocking this year due to the injury.
Chuck Harris is one of Pappy Waldorf's Junior Varsit,\ wonders -he played

POWELL 191 5-8 RGL 6-0 200 L ASTER
Owen Powell, a freshman standout, took a year to develop into a good
varsity player. He spent that year with the JVs last season, and is now one
of Stanford's best offensive linemen. Not fast, but quick and hard-hilling.
Wally Laster is a senior who spent most of last season playing behind two
year All-American Rod Fran/.. He is a fast aggressive guard with a great
deal ol football know-how. All iu all, a tvpical California lineman.
Edge: CALIFORNIA.
POMEROY 208 6-0 RTL (5-1 200 KARPE
Co-captain Russ Pomeroy has been the defensive standout for the Stan
lords for two seasons. Is probably the Coast's (maybe the c,>unlr.\\) best
linebacker and a good ollensive guard. May be iu for some national raliuv,.
Bob Karpe, a big, aggressive sophomore, is one ol the Golden Beats' better
linemen. Was particularly outstanding in the UCLA game. With two more
years of ball under his belt he may be great.
Edge: STANFORD.
SCOTT 192 0-4 REL (J-2 195 MI N ft HEN
Bob Scott, a JVer last year, will probably start in the injury-absence of
regular Bruce Van Alstyne. Scott, a tall, rangy wingman, can be an exolhni
pass receiver, but has had some bad days. A fair blocker, he is ver.\ good
going down under punts. Fast, aggressive.
Bob Minahen is playing his second year of varsity football, lie stepped
into the starting berth with the injury of Norm Pressley last year a ul has
been there ever since. Minahen is having his best season with the Bear.

Edge: CALIFORNIA.
KERKORIAN 180 5-11 QB 5-11 IS7 MARINOS
Kerkorian, hailed as great at the start of the season, has bad a disappointing
year. Showing flashes of sheer brilliance, Kerkorian has also had pei iods <.l
doldrums. Nevertheless, he is one of the best (JBs on the Co;.si llii-, year.
Can be a great passer on a dry day.
Marinos has heen over at Cal for four years and it wasn't until the USC
game this year that he got into a ball game. His teammates elected him game
captain for that fray. He has been the Bears' regular ever since. As a passei
he is just another thrower, but he is an excellent signal-caller.
Edge: STANFORD.
BENSON 165 5-11 LHR 5-11 185 SCHABARUM
Boyd Benson has shown himself, this year, to be Stanford's best running
back. Not equipped with too much speed, Benson is a great runner who -.els
up his blocks well, and hits like a man twice his size. Aggressive, and a good
blocker.
Pete Schabarum faced Benson in his yearling season at Cal and 111- two
provided one of tlhe most exciting fr«sh games of all times. Kchubarii'ti is
a fast, hard-hitting, straight-away runner who can, and has. gone all the

B. WHITE 177 5-11 RIIL 5-10 190 MONACHINO

field. Is probably Stanford's best back this year. A line runner, ami ;«■ id
blocker, White is also a good passer and can pass right-handed while numin ;
either way.
Jim Monachino is the lad who combined with Jack Swain r to kiii the
Stunfords in the '49 Big Game. A brilliant blocker, am! a better runner,
Monachino is California's best hack. Possibly he is (he Coast's mo out

MEYERS 190 6-1 F 5-11 105 OLSZEWSKI
Bob Meyers is playing his lirst year at Stanford and is a transfei from l.n-

consistent ground gainer. If Meyers does not start, big (20li) hurd-lettiii".
Bob Griflin will. Grillin, after an early-season slump, can.e Jj ; ck last week
against the Army with murderous efficiency.
Olszewski is the top sophomore find in the nation. lie is a »,r:-;i 1 l>! »ckei,

Monachino and Schabarum—in the Cal lineup. A hard plunger in the eent. r

ABKAIIAM 213 (1-2 C <1-1 2(10 HARRIS
Abraham, once a good Card linebacker, has heen reduced to olVensixe
action only due to a knee injury. Almost perfect as a center, Abraham has
been restricted in his blocking this year due to the injury.
Chuck Harris is one of Pappy Waldorf's Junior Varsit,\ wonders -he played
bul II minutes last season. Fair blocker, good center, should be excellent
his senior year.
Edge: EVEN.
POWELL 191 5-8 RGL 6-0 200 L ASTER
Owen Powell, a freshman standout, took a year to develop into a good
varsity player. He spent that year with the JVs last season, and is now one
of Stanford's best offensive linemen. Not fast, but quick and hard-hilling.
Wally Laster is a senior who spent most of last season playing behind two
year All-American Rod Fran/.. He is a fast aggressive guard with a great
deal ol football know-how. All iu all, a tvpical California lineman.
Edge: CALIFORNIA.
POMEROY 208 6-0 RTL (5-1 200 KARPE
Co-captain Russ Pomeroy has been the defensive standout for the Stan
lords for two seasons. Is probably the Coast's (maybe the c,>unlr.\\) best
linebacker and a good ollensive guard. May be iu for some national raliuv,.
Bob Karpe, a big, aggressive sophomore, is one ol the Golden Beats' better
linemen. Was particularly outstanding in the UCLA game. With two more
years of ball under his belt he may be great.
Edge: STANFORD.
SCOTT 192 0-4 REL (J-2 195 MI N ft HEN
Bob Scott, a JVer last year, will probably start in the injury-absence of
regular Bruce Van Alstyne. Scott, a tall, rangy wingman, can be an exolhni
pass receiver, but has had some bad days. A fair blocker, he is ver.\ good
going down under punts. Fast, aggressive.
Bob Minahen is playing his second year of varsity football, lie stepped
into the starting berth with the injury of Norm Pressley last year a ul has
been there ever since. Minahen is having his best season with the Bear.
this year.
If Van Alstyne should play, the edge is Stanford, but the way il looks now:
Edge: CALIFORNIA.
KERKORIAN 180 5-11 QB 5-11 IS7 MARINOS
Kerkorian, hailed as great at the start of the season, has bad a disappointing
year. Showing flashes of sheer brilliance, Kerkorian has also had pei iods <.l
doldrums. Nevertheless, he is one of the best (JBs on the Co;.si llii-, year.
Can be a great passer on a dry day.
Marinos has heen over at Cal for four years and it wasn't until the USC
game this year that he got into a ball game. His teammates elected him game
captain for that fray. He has been the Bears' regular ever since. As a passei
he is just another thrower, but he is an excellent signal-caller.
Edge: STANFORD.
BENSON 165 5-11 LHR 5-11 185 SCHABARUM
Boyd Benson has shown himself, this year, to be Stanford's best running
back. Not equipped with too much speed, Benson is a great runner who -.els
up his blocks well, and hits like a man twice his size. Aggressive, and a good
blocker.
Pete Schabarum faced Benson in his yearling season at Cal and 111- two
provided one of tlhe most exciting fr«sh games of all times. Kchubarii'ti is
a fast, hard-hitting, straight-away runner who can, and has. gone all the
way. Excellent blocker and good team man. Can pass with either rbdit >i
left hand.
Edge: CALIFORNIA.
B. WHITE 177 5-11 RIIL 5-10 190 MONACHINO
Bobby White, in tough games, has a tendency to be the lust bar!, on the
field. Is probably Stanford's best back this year. A line runner, ami ;«■ id
blocker, White is also a good passer and can pass right-handed while numin ;
either way.
Jim Monachino is the lad who combined with Jack Swain r to kiii the
Stunfords in the '49 Big Game. A brilliant blocker, am! a better runner,
Monachino is California's best hack. Possibly he is (he Coast's mo out
standing back. Like Schabarum, Monachino tan, and i hs. , cue ;;l! ;:'.e v..>\
on numerous occasions.
Edge: CALIFORNIA.
MEYERS 190 6-1 F 5-11 105 OLSZEWSKI
Bob Meyers is playing his lirst year at Stanford and is a transfei from l.n-
Angeles Valley Junior College. A good blocker, fast and an cM-clleut not
consistent ground gainer. If Meyers does not start, big (20li) hurd-lettiii".
Bob Griflin will. Grillin, after an early-season slump, can.e Jj ; ck last week
against the Army with murderous efficiency.
Olszewski is the top sophomore find in the nation. lie is a »,r:-;i 1 l>! »ckei,
