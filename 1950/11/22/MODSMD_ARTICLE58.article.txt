A hopeful Indian meets a confident
Bear Saturday in a game which be
cause of its color, spirit, upsets, thril
ling moments, and the unusual has
been dubbed the Big Game, a mon
icker synonymous with Stan.ord v:
California.
When the squads meet for the .Tin 1
time on the turf of Berkeley Me
morial Stadium, past records can be
discarded, form charts can be burnt d,
and football filberts can expect an
afternoon filled with surprises.
Turning back the pages ol time
faster than we Hip textbook pages, wc
arrive back at the 1892 game. It
started back in 1891 when a boast by
Herbert Hoover, then a student, to a
group of California braggarts, that
Stanford could lick the Bears pro
duced such hilarity on the California
campus, that Hoover took it upon
himself to see that his boast was
completed.
Odds of 25 to 1 were offered on the
big football noise of the West, Cali
fornia, that March 14, 1892. A curi
ous crowd of 7,000 came out to the
San Francisco Ball Park to watch an
upsiart Stanford team upset a proud
California, 14 to 10.
1921. The 20 to 20 tie is marked by
many as the greatest of all Big
Games. One hundred thousand
crowded Berkeley Memorial Stadium
and the surrounding hills to witness
the first meeting between Pop War
ner, master of razzle dazzle, and
Andy Smith, creator of the Wonder
Teams.
The Bears, working on a five
game win streak over the Cards,
were leading 20 to G with 10 minutes
to go. And then Ted Shipkey made
a sensational catch in the end zone.
Murray Cuddeback added another
six points on a pay-dirt pass comple
tion as the clock s hands pointed
straight up. Cuddeback added the
20th point before a hushed, standing
stadium.
1947. Inspired by the play of
George Quist, the winless Indians
rose from 10 to 1 underdogs to lead
18 to 14 with three minutes to go.
A Jack Jenson to Paul Keckley
prayer pass paid off and Cal was in,
21 to 18, saving the Bears' pride and
a heap of gamblers money. However,
in so doing they set Stanford down
with her greatest moral victory in a
season which saw nine defeats.
1949. It was Rose Bowl talk again.
The Big Game would decide it. And
it did. Cal showed too much power
and ran through, over, and past an
injury riddled Cardinal to win, 33
to 14.
To date Stanford has totaled 572
points to the Bears' 594.
