State for iourth place in the PCC
standings.
Tile highly-favored Bears, on tin
other hand, boast a pi rUvt iJ-li season
rtcord, and are r; ted loui Ui in ttu
nation by some observers.
Leading the Bears' offensive pla
toon will be three hard-driving Lack:
Jim Monachino, a laugh Big (Jam.
veteran, Johnny Olszewski, a hard
running sophomore fullback, ant.
Pete Schatarum, one of the top .scor
ers on the Pacific Coast. Jim Ma
linos will be handling the Bear con
trols at quarterback.
An outstanding defensive platoon
is led by All-American candidate Li'.
Richter, who backs up a solid Cali
fornia forward wall.
The Indians, however, can boast ol
a few stars of their own. Big Bib
McColl, also a strong candidate loi
All-American honors, has already set
a new Conference pass catching rec
ordâ€”:J4 completions in one season.
Rugged linebacker Russ Pomeroy
the key to the Cardinal defense, has
been outstanding for the Indians al.
season, and should turn in a great
game Saturday.
Quarterback Gary Kerkorian, who
has had some rough spots this season
seemed to have iound his passing eye
again in the Washington State game.
Kerkorian is second only to Wash
ington's Don Heinrich in PCC total
offense.
Dick Horn, ace Card punter, could
keep the Bears in a hole throughout
the game with his magnificent kick
ing.
The Bears will be in perfect shape
physically for Saturday's traditional
contest.
The Indians can't boast that per
fect record. Gary Kerkorian, 801.
Griffin, and Joe St. Genie all re
ceived minor injuries in the Army
contest, but will all be ready in time
for the rugged game.
Good news was received in Stan
ford quarters when it was learnfo
that end Bruce Van Alstyne might bt
able to play. In practice yesterday,
Van Alstyne was catching a good
percetnage of quarterback Tommy
Shaw's accurate passes.
The Big Game record now standi,
at 23 wins lor Stanford and 21 loi
the favored Bears. The Indians,
starved of a Big Game victory since
15)46, will go all out to win this one
