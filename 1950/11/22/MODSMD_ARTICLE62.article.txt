| stunned and shocked.
Kichter Goat
The came was more than a missed
conversion. The Cards played des
j neratcly, even valiantly, but at no
j time did they appear a match for the
methodical, powerful Bears. But they
j ' ushed in on every break and went
home with the axe. The Cards could
not he denied today. This was THEIR
SATURDAY.

downs. Other Stanford scores were

made by Bobby Bryan and Captain
Russ Pomeroy.
Down to Bear iS

only one pass and that was dropped.
Every yard was gained by the charges
of Johnny Olszewski, Pete Scha

had seen the Rear power overwhelm
the Indians completely.
Horn Kicks To Bears

moved for one first down on a short
pass from Horn to McColl that col
lected the necessary yardage. Then

o completely that the closeness of
'he score was surprising, even ridicu
lous.
'i he Cards took the second half
kick-off and failed to do anything
with the ball. One pass play clicked
but faitied only five yards. The Reds
kicked and the Bears got hold of the
ball. The Red forward wall fought

to kick.
