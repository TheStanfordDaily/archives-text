# Coaches, Other Experts Pick Saturday Winner
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Although Webster has strong
ly considered taking the word
'expert" out of his dictionary
;ince the last presidential elec
tion, still every year people
want to hear how the various
"experts" predict outcomc
of the Big Game.
The two men who can speak with
the most authority on the two teams |
| involved in the fracas are Coaches
Mi.'.xhie Schwartz and Pappy Wal
dorf. Although they will be pulling
all stops in this Saturday's encoun- j
tcr, a pre-game interview showed J
that they have formed a mutual i
admiration society.
The portly, bass - voiced Wal
dorf had this to say: "We've al
ways had a great respect for
Stanford, not just since the Army
game. The Army game just means
that they have reached their
peak.
"Who would I pick out as top
Stanford players? Well, McColl is
an outstanding hoy. A true All- !
American. Russ Pomeroy is as good |
| a linebacker as there is on the
Coast. Maybe the best. Stanford
has very fine halfbacks—Hugasian,
White, Benson, Bryan, and South- j
wood. And the fullbacks have come
! along very fast — Meyers, Griffin,
i arH this boy Crist
"We have a healthy respect for
your three quarterbacks — Kerko
rian, Horn, and Shaw. Alto, Stan-
I ford has a strong defensive line—
j Cone, Manoogian, White, Broderick,
| and others.
"Fortunately, we're in top physi
cal shape for this game, and we'll
| have a new slant or two worked up
for Stanford. We'll go with the
same offensive and defensive line
ups we've started in the last two
I games.
"The field is pretty wet right j
j now, and I think a muddy fie'd I
would impede us both equally. This
is a traditional football game and
anything can happen; it will be SO
SO."
M a r c hi e Schwartz, Stanford's
handsome bea'l man, had this
licht to shed upon the came: "We i
were very high mentally for the j
Army game, and if we can keep
that same pitch, we might come
I'ltHHfh. Our sc'Mits toll us. how- '
ever, that Cal is even better than
A i my.
"Good as our players are, they I
have three for every one that, we
can musler. They aren't noted for
I ' a< sing, and yet their two top pass- ;
itig quarterbacks, Marinos and !
Mais, have completed 28 out of 43.
[ the best, average on the coart.
"I don't think any team in the
country has three better hacks than
Monachino, Olzsewski, and Scha- !
| barum.
"If there wasn't, the factor of spir-
I it, there wouldn't be a m;>n in
IJnitel States who woiijd pick
Stanford, and, unfortunately, we
don't have a monopoly on spirit.
We've got a few new plays cooked
up for Cal, however.
"The game could be very close.
I or it could break wide open."
In response to the question, "Who
is going to win the Big Game, by
what score, and why?" the follow
ing sports scribes, radio announcers,"
I and assorted "experts" had this to
say:
Ira Blue, KOO sports comment a
l»r and forecaster: "The only game
I've picked right all year is the P?t
aluma Leghorns' game, but I think
if it's muddy, Cal will win 27 t'» 0
I say that for this reason: Cal has
had the opportunity to play in the
; mud twice, and I think thev played
j under wraps against USF. They
will have a tremendous advantage

in the mud because of the straight
ahead power of their three great
running backs.
"If the field is not muddy, I would
say Cal 21 to 14. Stanford could use
their speed and great passing po
tential in dry conditions."
Bill Loiser, sports editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle and for
mer editor of The Stanford Daily:
"Cal, 21 to 17. T ni> man*' running
backs. Too many platoons."
Dink Tcmplcton, former Card
track and football star, track
coach, and now a syndicated writ
er and sports commentator: "Go
ing on the assumption that it will
be a bum field, it will he Cal 11
to 10. They have a powerful line
and an offense that is designed f«.r
a muddy field.
"If they change the weather, it
might be a different story. In fact
we might murder 'em."
Prescott Sullivan, San Francisco
Examiner sports columnist: "Cal by
two touchdowns. If it's muddy, I'd
say 0 to 0. Everything in the form
book shows Cal to be the better
team."
Ilarry Hayward. Examiner sports
writer: "Cal by one touchdown.
But this is the Big Game. Underdog
Stanford teams have done it before.
They can r'o it again."
Roger Williams, San Frs ncisco
News writer: "Cal, 21 to 14. The
Bears have a shade, because of their
terrific line charge. Stanford will
definitely be in the scoring; that
Bryan could break up the ball
game any time."
Mary Ann Kcrnns, Stanford
pom-pom girl: "Stanford, 7 to (I.
Because of the game we played

against Army and Yu/ «p tHe*
spirit." (Note: The Daily also
wants th r female "intuition"
viewpoint.)
Ann Smith. Cal coed: "Califor
nia by 7 points, because of » su
perior line."
Dick Friemllich, San Francisco
Chronicle: "Cal, 21 to 14. Sip'-rioi
reserves will pull it out in thn
fourth quarter."
Harvey Rockwell, San Francisco
News: "California, 21 to 7. Then
tremendous running, terrific line
charge."
Art Uosenhaum, San Francisco
Chronicic: "Stanford v/ill win 2K
to 14. Why? Because 1 like to pick
'em wrong." (Note: Mr. Rosen -
baum's system is to pick the loser
to win, such as New Mexico over
Army.)
Art Johnson, San Francisco
Chronicle: "It's the Bears, 2U to
7. Superior depth and more of
fensive continuity will win fur the
Bcrkeleyites."
Walt Gamage, sj.orts editor of
the Palo Alto Times and Exami
ner writer: "Stanford 21, Califor
nia 14. Stanford gained the confi
dence it needed in its inspired
fight against Army, and will go on
to do what no other team has
done in three yej.vs."
Jack McDonald, sports editor of
the San Francisco Call-Bulletin: 'if
it's a wet field, Cal 14 to 0. If t>
going is dry, then 1 would say Cal
14 to 10. I pick California becau ••
!of their superior running game. A
dry field would give Stanford a
| wonderful chance for an upset,
j since then the Cards could put their
passing to work."
