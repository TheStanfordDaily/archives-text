# CAL'S 1950 TEAM--GREATEST OF ALL?
## Bears Out For 23rd PCC Victory 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
They said in August that the year of our Lord 1950 wasn't Cali
forrva's years.
Bu l , oh Lord, what a team California came up with in 1950.
CXily 15 lettermevi were on hand for Pappy Waldorf's first prac-!
lice this season, i hree positions, both tackles and the quarter-

back .slot, not a veteran re
turned from the 1049 monogram win
ners.
Bit. fate provides for a school with
20,000 students and a coach of Pappy's
wizardry, and while Cal's bench is
not as long perhaps as in years past,
its efficiency speaks for itself.
But enough of generalities. Our
prevent purpose is to introduce to you
tho.e burly golden Bears who com
prise, so say many, the finest foot
fall team in California's history. So
let's meet the Bears:
ENDS: B'ive iettermm make the
"'in :.s Pappy's strongest position from
the standpoint of depth. The bit?
names are those of Bob Minahen and
Eoh Cummings, both excellent pass
catchers who haven't been called on
much in a year in which Cal's ground
i ame has been predominant, But
they'll be ready, and exceedingly
cr.j abe, whenever quarterback Ma
i inos decides to mix 'em up.
The other lettcrmen who will see
plenty of action, primarily on de
ft nse, are Ed Bartlctt and Dick Le-
Mon. But watch out for a couple of
heretofore unknowns named Bob
Fitzgerald and Paul Andrew, ofTen
sive and defensive stars respectively
in Cal's 35 to 0 waltz against UCLA
two weeks ago.
Andrew is the lad who stole most
of the rave notices that day from
the heartily ballyhooed duo of Les
Pichtcr and Donn Mnomaw. He's
mad" to order for stopping Stanford's
sweeping end runs. Fitzgerald tal

j the Btuins on a Ifl-yard Marines
I pitch.
I TACKMS: Inexperience was the
| keynote here ;i) the hnginnint; of the
j season, hut sophomores Ralph Krue-
I ger and Bob Karpc have learned fast,
adequately filled in the spots vacated
last year by the .Jarrin' Jims, Turner
and Cu'lom.
Kreuger and Karp, literally the
bulk of the Cnl line, will field 44D
pounds, split evenly, between I he two
of them.
Defensively, Pappy will throw two
more hulking .sophomores at the
Cards. Don Curran is (5 ft. 2 in.,
pushes the pointer to 217, while run
ning mate Glenn Ciulvin is a compar
ative slringbc an, packing 200 pounds
on a 6 ft. 4 in. frame.
(«UA|{|>S: Les Rirhter is li. tod at
I this position when he plays ofTense,
I though his main claim to fame is at
defensive linchacker. But we'll talk
about him here, then try to forget,
(he subject.
Nineteen-year-old Les is almost a
J cinch All-American choice this year,
| deserves the honor. He's earned the
| reward mainly by an uncanny ability
| to diagnose opponents' plays and plug
the gaps. OfTense or defense, he's
i the led voted most likely to cause
Stanford not to succeed Saturday
j afternoon.
The California press book, pub
i lishd at the beginning of th * season.
' states of the guard position, "depth

lacking." Hah! What a difference a
few months make.
In addition to Richtcr, Pappy still
has Ray Solari around, plus a host of
sophs and juniors who have eradi
cated his center-of-the-line worries.
Wally Laster and Bob Bagley are two
of the standouts whose names you'll
be hearing over the P.A. system Sat
urday. They've both had some pre
vious experience, but developed pri
marily in Cal's first few games this
season.
CENTERS: The press book com
ment here was "fair." This time we
agree. Center is the only Cal posi
tion not buried helmet-deep in head
line material.
Nevertheless, the available talent
named Dick Groger and Charles
Harris, are dependable performers
capable of making almost anybody's
football team. Dependable enough,
incidentally, that they both lettered
last year. But, they're not All-Ameri
cans, which from one point of view
makes them the standouts of the Cal
team.
QUARTERBACKS: A sore subject
with Pappy for approximately half
the season, this position was respon
sible for more sleepless nights than
the rest, of the team combined. Then
out of the fifth-string depths arose
Jim Marines to save the day and
Pappy's disposition.
Marinos really arrived in the UCLA
game, when his hand-ofT magic and
generalship sparked the northern
branch to their lopsided victory. Also
the Bear arm, Marinos was leading
the conference prior to the USF con
test with a .completion average.
If the going gets rough, praise God,
Marinos probably won't be replaced.
Otherwise, Pappy can call on any one
of three second-string signal callers
of apparntly equal ability. Their

names arc Brent Ogden, Bill Mais,
and Dick Lee; their records, prac
tically non-existent. A fifth quarter
back, Carl VanHeuit, will play de
fensive safety, hasn't received much
oflensive call.
HALFBACKS: Curb! They're
named Jim Monachina and Pete
Sehabarum, as if you didn't know.
As of Cal's eighth game this season,
they had averaged nearly seven and
six yards respectively every time
they carried the oval. In addi
tion, Sehabarum is the leading scorc r
in the PCC.
Both boys have gained permanent
spots in the memories of Indian root

ers for their performance in p»st Big
Games. Monachino in particular was
a rot gh one to hanellc last year, when
he exploded for 80 yards on one oc
casion, snared a long touchdown pass
on another.
For relief. Cal has Johnny Pappa
and Gene West. Junior Pappa has
himself entered his bid for stardom on
the few instances that he's been al
lowed to replace one of the fabulous
first -stringers.
FULLBACK: Double ouch, and
again unnecessary to name the start
er. But we will anyway, just to get
'•orl to the sound. Name: Johnny
Olszewski. Record: a startling fl 7

yards running average. Pro. |
All-American, if not this sea <,n

tho.e burly golden Bears who com

let's meet the Bears:

The other lettcrmen who will see

heretofore unknowns named Bob

in Cal's 35 to 0 waltz against UCLA

In addition to Richtcr, Pappy still
has Ray Solari around, plus a host of
sophs and juniors who have eradi
cated his center-of-the-line worries.
Wally Laster and Bob Bagley are two
of the standouts whose names you'll
be hearing over the P.A. system Sat
urday. They've both had some pre
vious experience, but developed pri
marily in Cal's first few games this
season.
CENTERS: The press book com
ment here was "fair." This time we
agree. Center is the only Cal posi
tion not buried helmet-deep in head
line material.
Nevertheless, the available talent
named Dick Groger and Charles
Harris, are dependable performers
capable of making almost anybody's
football team. Dependable enough,
incidentally, that they both lettered
last year. But, they're not All-Ameri
cans, which from one point of view
makes them the standouts of the Cal
team.
QUARTERBACKS: A sore subject
with Pappy for approximately half
the season, this position was respon
sible for more sleepless nights than
the rest, of the team combined. Then
out of the fifth-string depths arose
Jim Marines to save the day and
Pappy's disposition.
Marinos really arrived in the UCLA
game, when his hand-ofT magic and
generalship sparked the northern
branch to their lopsided victory. Also
the Bear arm, Marinos was leading
the conference prior to the USF con
test with a .completion average.
If the going gets rough, praise God,
Marinos probably won't be replaced.
Otherwise, Pappy can call on any one
of three second-string signal callers
of apparntly equal ability. Their

names arc Brent Ogden, Bill Mais,
and Dick Lee; their records, prac
tically non-existent. A fifth quarter
back, Carl VanHeuit, will play de
fensive safety, hasn't received much
oflensive call.
HALFBACKS: Curb! They're
named Jim Monachina and Pete
Sehabarum, as if you didn't know.
As of Cal's eighth game this season,
they had averaged nearly seven and
six yards respectively every time
they carried the oval. In addi
tion, Sehabarum is the leading scorc r
in the PCC.
Both boys have gained permanent
spots in the memories of Indian root

ers for their performance in p»st Big
Games. Monachino in particular was
a rot gh one to hanellc last year, when
he exploded for 80 yards on one oc
casion, snared a long touchdown pass
on another.
For relief. Cal has Johnny Pappa
and Gene West. Junior Pappa has
himself entered his bid for stardom on
the few instances that he's been al
lowed to replace one of the fabulous
first -stringers.

But enough of generalities. Our
prevent purpose is to introduce to you
tho.e burly golden Bears who com

fall team in California's history. So
let's meet the Bears:
ENDS: B'ive iettermm make the

cr.j abe, whenever quarterback Ma

The other lettcrmen who will see
plenty of action, primarily on de

Mon. But watch out for a couple of
heretofore unknowns named Bob
Fitzgerald and Paul Andrew, ofTen
sive and defensive stars respectively
in Cal's 35 to 0 waltz against UCLA

Kreuger and Karp, literally the

Defensively, Pappy will throw two

lacking." Hah! What a difference a
few months make.
In addition to Richtcr, Pappy still
has Ray Solari around, plus a host of
sophs and juniors who have eradi
cated his center-of-the-line worries.
Wally Laster and Bob Bagley are two
of the standouts whose names you'll
be hearing over the P.A. system Sat
urday. They've both had some pre
vious experience, but developed pri
marily in Cal's first few games this
season.
CENTERS: The press book com
ment here was "fair." This time we
agree. Center is the only Cal posi
tion not buried helmet-deep in head
line material.
Nevertheless, the available talent
named Dick Groger and Charles
Harris, are dependable performers
capable of making almost anybody's
football team. Dependable enough,
incidentally, that they both lettered
last year. But, they're not All-Ameri
cans, which from one point of view
makes them the standouts of the Cal
team.
QUARTERBACKS: A sore subject
with Pappy for approximately half
the season, this position was respon
sible for more sleepless nights than
the rest, of the team combined. Then
out of the fifth-string depths arose
Jim Marines to save the day and
Pappy's disposition.
Marinos really arrived in the UCLA
game, when his hand-ofT magic and
generalship sparked the northern
branch to their lopsided victory. Also
the Bear arm, Marinos was leading
the conference prior to the USF con
test with a .completion average.
If the going gets rough, praise God,
Marinos probably won't be replaced.
Otherwise, Pappy can call on any one
of three second-string signal callers
of apparntly equal ability. Their

names arc Brent Ogden, Bill Mais,
and Dick Lee; their records, prac
tically non-existent. A fifth quarter
back, Carl VanHeuit, will play de
fensive safety, hasn't received much
oflensive call.
HALFBACKS: Curb! They're
named Jim Monachina and Pete
Sehabarum, as if you didn't know.
As of Cal's eighth game this season,
they had averaged nearly seven and
six yards respectively every time
they carried the oval. In addi
tion, Sehabarum is the leading scorc r
in the PCC.
Both boys have gained permanent
spots in the memories of Indian root

ers for their performance in p»st Big
Games. Monachino in particular was
a rot gh one to hanellc last year, when
he exploded for 80 yards on one oc
casion, snared a long touchdown pass
on another.
For relief. Cal has Johnny Pappa
and Gene West. Junior Pappa has
himself entered his bid for stardom on
the few instances that he's been al
lowed to replace one of the fabulous
first -stringers.

CXily 15 lettermevi were on hand for Pappy Waldorf's first prac-!
lice this season, i hree positions, both tackles and the quarter-

back .slot, not a veteran re
turned from the 1049 monogram win
ners.
Bit. fate provides for a school with
20,000 students and a coach of Pappy's
wizardry, and while Cal's bench is
not as long perhaps as in years past,
its efficiency speaks for itself.
But enough of generalities. Our
prevent purpose is to introduce to you
tho.e burly golden Bears who com
prise, so say many, the finest foot
fall team in California's history. So
let's meet the Bears:
ENDS: B'ive iettermm make the
"'in :.s Pappy's strongest position from
the standpoint of depth. The bit?
names are those of Bob Minahen and
Eoh Cummings, both excellent pass
catchers who haven't been called on
much in a year in which Cal's ground
i ame has been predominant, But
they'll be ready, and exceedingly
cr.j abe, whenever quarterback Ma
i inos decides to mix 'em up.
The other lettcrmen who will see
plenty of action, primarily on de
ft nse, are Ed Bartlctt and Dick Le-
Mon. But watch out for a couple of
heretofore unknowns named Bob
Fitzgerald and Paul Andrew, ofTen
sive and defensive stars respectively
in Cal's 35 to 0 waltz against UCLA
two weeks ago.
Andrew is the lad who stole most
of the rave notices that day from
the heartily ballyhooed duo of Les
Pichtcr and Donn Mnomaw. He's
mad" to order for stopping Stanford's
sweeping end runs. Fitzgerald tal

I TACKMS: Inexperience was the
| keynote here ;i) the hnginnint; of the
j season, hut sophomores Ralph Krue-
I ger and Bob Karpc have learned fast,
adequately filled in the spots vacated
last year by the .Jarrin' Jims, Turner
and Cu'lom.
Kreuger and Karp, literally the
bulk of the Cnl line, will field 44D
pounds, split evenly, between I he two
of them.
Defensively, Pappy will throw two
more hulking .sophomores at the
Cards. Don Curran is (5 ft. 2 in.,
pushes the pointer to 217, while run
ning mate Glenn Ciulvin is a compar
ative slringbc an, packing 200 pounds
on a 6 ft. 4 in. frame.
(«UA|{|>S: Les Rirhter is li. tod at
I this position when he plays ofTense,
I though his main claim to fame is at
defensive linchacker. But we'll talk
about him here, then try to forget,

Nineteen-year-old Les is almost a

| reward mainly by an uncanny ability
| to diagnose opponents' plays and plug
the gaps. OfTense or defense, he's

Stanford not to succeed Saturday
j afternoon.
The California press book, pub
i lishd at the beginning of th * season.
' states of the guard position, "depth

lacking." Hah! What a difference a
few months make.
In addition to Richtcr, Pappy still
has Ray Solari around, plus a host of
sophs and juniors who have eradi
cated his center-of-the-line worries.
Wally Laster and Bob Bagley are two
of the standouts whose names you'll
be hearing over the P.A. system Sat
urday. They've both had some pre
vious experience, but developed pri
marily in Cal's first few games this
season.
CENTERS: The press book com
ment here was "fair." This time we
agree. Center is the only Cal posi
tion not buried helmet-deep in head
line material.
Nevertheless, the available talent
named Dick Groger and Charles
Harris, are dependable performers
capable of making almost anybody's
football team. Dependable enough,
incidentally, that they both lettered
last year. But, they're not All-Ameri
cans, which from one point of view
makes them the standouts of the Cal
team.
QUARTERBACKS: A sore subject
with Pappy for approximately half
the season, this position was respon
sible for more sleepless nights than
the rest, of the team combined. Then
out of the fifth-string depths arose
Jim Marines to save the day and
Pappy's disposition.
Marinos really arrived in the UCLA
game, when his hand-ofT magic and
generalship sparked the northern
branch to their lopsided victory. Also
the Bear arm, Marinos was leading
the conference prior to the USF con
test with a .completion average.
If the going gets rough, praise God,
Marinos probably won't be replaced.
Otherwise, Pappy can call on any one
of three second-string signal callers
of apparntly equal ability. Their

names arc Brent Ogden, Bill Mais,
and Dick Lee; their records, prac
tically non-existent. A fifth quarter
back, Carl VanHeuit, will play de
fensive safety, hasn't received much
oflensive call.
HALFBACKS: Curb! They're
named Jim Monachina and Pete
Sehabarum, as if you didn't know.
As of Cal's eighth game this season,
they had averaged nearly seven and
six yards respectively every time
they carried the oval. In addi
tion, Sehabarum is the leading scorc r
in the PCC.
Both boys have gained permanent
spots in the memories of Indian root

ers for their performance in p»st Big
Games. Monachino in particular was
a rot gh one to hanellc last year, when
he exploded for 80 yards on one oc
casion, snared a long touchdown pass
on another.
For relief. Cal has Johnny Pappa
and Gene West. Junior Pappa has
himself entered his bid for stardom on
the few instances that he's been al
lowed to replace one of the fabulous
first -stringers.
FULLBACK: Double ouch, and
again unnecessary to name the start
er. But we will anyway, just to get
'•orl to the sound. Name: Johnny
Olszewski. Record: a startling fl 7

yards running average. Pro. |
All-American, if not this sea <,n

season game, and two Rose Bowl games in his past three years.
