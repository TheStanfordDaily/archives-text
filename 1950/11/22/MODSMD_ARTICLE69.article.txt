# Stanford on Short End Of Comparative Scores
## 
### 
Comparatively speaking, Stanford's
! riendly foes from across the Bay,
j California, are far out in front of the
1 1950 Indian team.
In the season's opener,'Cal tripped
up Santa Clara, 27 to 9. The Broncos
tallied in the first period holding the
Bears scoreless. Remembering their
Rose Bowl chances in the second
i quarter, California roared back and
I started the scoring parade.
When Santa Clara met Stanford on
Oct. 14, the Indians had their hands
j ull in downing an inspired Bronco
; team, 23 to 13. Scores came hard for
the Cards that day.
Narrow Escape
On that same Saturday, Cal had a
narrow escape in Los Angeles as USC
; narrowly missed a possible last
j minute tie or win from the Bears,
j The final scoreboard reading was
California 13, Southern California 7.
When SC trekked north for their
traditional with Stanford, the Trojans
had the fresh taste of victory after a
long string of defeats. One of the
hardest-fought games on the Coast
ensued as touchdowns wer.e kept to a
bare minimum. A carefully planned
running attack engineered by quar

tei back Tom Shaw in the waning
minutes of the game gave the Indians
a 7 to 7 tie.
Stanford blanked Oregon State, 21
to 0 en the Beavers' home ground
Several weeks later, Cal knocked
OSC. 27 to 0.
As far as the scoring went, both
teams played almost opposite ball
against Oregon State. Stanford
started strong and coasted in for the
win.
Cal had a slow time in getting their
touchdowns in order, and turned out
to be a second-half team against the
Beavers.
Bruin Turns Tide
UCLA turned the tide on the pre
season publicized Stanfords. In Me
morial Coliseum, the Uclan home
coming theme of "Frontier Bruin
Brings Injun Ruin," came true, 21
to 7. It wasn't the smog that made
our eyes run that day.
On the other handy the powerful
California grid machine bowled over
a supposedly strong Bruin eleven,
35 to 0. Billed as the "Battle for the
Rose Bowl." the game turned into a
one-sided Bear victory. The big win
placed Coach Waldorf's powerhouse
on top of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence heap.
The Pacific Coast Conference first
touchdown race for the Rose Bowl
found Cal and dark horse Washing
ton battling in Seattle on Nov. 4. Cal
won another, 14 to 7, before 50,000
persens, and everyone said it would
be three consecutive years in Pasa
dena for the Golden Bears.
When Stanford met the hard
charging Huskies, the Cardinals still
had a faint spark of life leit for the
Pores. Washington blew out the fire
with a 21 to 7 rout, with hard-slinging
Don Heinrich paving the way.

a supposedly strong Bruin eleven,
35 to 0. Billed as the "Battle for the
Rose Bowl." the game turned into a
one-sided Bear victory. The big win
placed Coach Waldorf's powerhouse
on top of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence heap.
The Pacific Coast Conference first
touchdown race for the Rose Bowl
found Cal and dark horse Washing
ton battling in Seattle on Nov. 4. Cal
won another, 14 to 7, before 50,000
persens, and everyone said it would
be three consecutive years in Pasa
dena for the Golden Bears.
When Stanford met the hard
charging Huskies, the Cardinals still
had a faint spark of life leit for the
Pores. Washington blew out the fire
with a 21 to 7 rout, with hard-slinging
Don Heinrich paving the way.

Comparatively speaking, Stanford's
! riendly foes from across the Bay,
j California, are far out in front of the
1 1950 Indian team.
In the season's opener,'Cal tripped
up Santa Clara, 27 to 9. The Broncos
tallied in the first period holding the
Bears scoreless. Remembering their
Rose Bowl chances in the second
i quarter, California roared back and
I started the scoring parade.
When Santa Clara met Stanford on
Oct. 14, the Indians had their hands
j ull in downing an inspired Bronco
; team, 23 to 13. Scores came hard for
the Cards that day.
Narrow Escape

narrow escape in Los Angeles as USC
; narrowly missed a possible last
j minute tie or win from the Bears,
j The final scoreboard reading was
California 13, Southern California 7.
When SC trekked north for their
traditional with Stanford, the Trojans
had the fresh taste of victory after a
long string of defeats. One of the
hardest-fought games on the Coast
ensued as touchdowns wer.e kept to a
bare minimum. A carefully planned
running attack engineered by quar

tei back Tom Shaw in the waning
minutes of the game gave the Indians
a 7 to 7 tie.
Stanford blanked Oregon State, 21
to 0 en the Beavers' home ground
Several weeks later, Cal knocked
OSC. 27 to 0.
As far as the scoring went, both
teams played almost opposite ball
against Oregon State. Stanford
started strong and coasted in for the
win.
Cal had a slow time in getting their
touchdowns in order, and turned out
to be a second-half team against the
Beavers.
Bruin Turns Tide
UCLA turned the tide on the pre
season publicized Stanfords. In Me
morial Coliseum, the Uclan home
coming theme of "Frontier Bruin
Brings Injun Ruin," came true, 21
to 7. It wasn't the smog that made
our eyes run that day.
