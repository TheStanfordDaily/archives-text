# Yea, the Game Has Changed Since 1900, But Not the California Golden Bear

### BOB SPIELMANN 
Football 50 years ago war
quite a bit different from the of
snsive-minded, platoon system
:>otball of today.
Befom 1895 it was fashionable to
have eight men in the line and only
three men in the backfield. Witmn
the next lew years, however, the
guards were sometimes moved in tne
backfield, and then the tackles also.
This sometimes resulted in bavin"
10 men in the backfield and leaving
the center holding the ball.
In 1903 it became a rule to have
seven men in the line. If the bail hap
pened to be within the 25-yard line,
that is.
To compensate for this disadvan
tage, the quarterback was allowed to
carry the ball for the first time. Pro
viding it was in midfield, he did not
cross the line of scrimmage further
than five yards from the center.
L«, the poor '1 -iormation!
Six Backs in '04
In 1904 somebody changed his mind
again and half a dozen men were al
lowed to roam around the backfield.
However, all extra men had to have
both feet outside their outside line-
Tian. 1! their outside lineman hap
pened to be the center this wasn't
lard to do.
It was still bewailed that with such
a set-up only one end could be run
around at a time. It seems that in
some circles it had been common to
use two balls and see around which
of the ends you could make the most
yardage.
If you are now thoroughly con
fused, we'll let it go at that.
Jiui them war the good old days.
Cows In Rose l!owl
Of course the Rose Bowl was iust a
ow pasture then, and those Michigan
Wolverines sure acted like a bunch of
mad bulls. Beat us 49 to 0.
'1 hat was a dirty trick. After steal
ing our coach from us, too.
But let's go back a year to the 1900.
season. The Cardinal was rolling
Lhen. "Hurry Up" Yost was pushing
•.he boys. To show what a team we
'iad, we beat Reliance not once but
three times. This is the mark of a
powerhouse!
In the same general category, such
teams as the Celtics, the Olympic, and
he Barbarians (doubtlessly a team
from the regions of Siberia) were met
and sometimes beaten. The Olympics,
though, were addicted to a disturb
ing habit of beating the Indinns.
In 1900 we had sense enough not
to play them.
Instead we plastered San Jose

twice, 35 to 0 and 24 fco 0. The second
time some members of the student
body and alumni were greatly dis
turbed because the score wasn't
higher.
Alums IJeat Varsity
The Alumni decided they could
,>luy better ball than that and next
week proved it by beating the varsity
14 to 0.
It was an on and off season with
the tc:am looking good at times, and
not so hot at others. Hopes improved
as the squad had little trouble in
taking Oregon 34 to 0. It was ex
xcted that the Indians would give
.Sievi'da, one of the top teams in the
West at the time, a good workout.
Tiny did, but lost just the same.
The score was (j to 0.
Because of this a variety of people
became disgruntled and v/anted to
throw out the coach. It looked like
Fielding Yost was on his way to
Michigan.
Ibis brings us and the team up to
the Big Game on Nov. 29. The team
had won six games and lost two, and
was considered to be a flashy outfit
which could win a game but might
just as easily throw it away. Cali
fornia had started slowly, but was
improving steadily.
(Does this sound familiar?)
The Stanford spirit was high. The
Indians won the toss and chose the
north goal. This gave cause for a
resounding cheer. (It is said some
people feared that this would be their
only opportunity.)
Litt e did they know! During the
first half the players seemed to have
some mistaken idea that the field was
only 20 yards long. The 20 yards
starting at the Stanford goal line.
'1 he ball stayed there, with California
bavin* possession most of the time.
Kicker Cross-Eyed
The Bears tried four field goals,

but the kicker was cross-eyed, a de
i ficiency which was not discovered
until alter tlie game. All the attempts
failed.
Stanford came off the field at half
| time without having had possession
of the i.all outside their 50-yard lin:;,
j or having made a first down.
An interesting sidelight was that
| by the middle of the first hall so many
j players had been ejected for siug
j ging they had to start using the 1 resit-
I men.
The second half began like the firt t,
and after a couple of more field goal
tries by the cross-eyed fellow had
i failed, the Indians got their chance
! by blocking one, and recovering the
; bail at midfield. Here the Indians
started rolling, and a fellow by the
name of E. A. Smith who played a
I simply dashing game (that's what the
Quad says), reeled oil the longest run
j of the day.
It went ior five yards.
Drop Kick Wins (iuine
After ti>e Cards had worked the
j ball down to the Cal 30-yard line
| Traeger dropped back and kicked a
J perfect field goal. That was the game.
It is mentioned in passing that
i Raitt's work was not* up to expecta
tions as he was hurt early in the game
and was unable to use his head.
What kind of football were they
playing?
Alter the game there was great
; celebration and a good deal of toast
ing of the coach, and otherwise. It
was said that there was a good chance
that the Stanford spirit, which hail
been buried some years before, would
i be revived.
Yost went to Michigan anyway.
He came back to the Coast to visit
the next year, but after it was all
over the Indians wished he'd stayed
back at Ann Arbor. That was the
game in which a Stanford guard by
the name of Roosevelt played for 10
minutes with a broken leg.
