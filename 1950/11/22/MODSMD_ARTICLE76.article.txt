# Pappy Completes Fourth Year at Cal
## 
### 
California's hulking, happy head
mentor, Lynn Waldorf, v/ill wind up
his fourth regular season at the helm
of Bear grid fortunes when his !
charges meet Stanford in Saturday's j
Big Game.
They've Icen outrageously suc
cessful years for the ex-Northwest
ern coach. During the regular season, |
Pappy's Berkeley teams have lost but
one game—and that one loss, to USC
in 1947, kept California out of the j
Pasadtna classic for the only time i
during his reign.

Waldorf was hired by the East Bay
institution following a student body
demonstration against then-coach
Frank Wickhorst, the flareup oocur
ing on the occasion of Stanford's 25
to (j Big Game victory in the 1946
classic.
Pappy is 47, father of two daugh
ters, and claims Clifton Springs, N.Y.,
as his birthplace. He played three
years of college football for Syracuse
University where he starred at—you
guessed it —the tackle position.
