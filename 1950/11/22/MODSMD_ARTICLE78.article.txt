# "Box" Coordinates Big Game Activities
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
High above the tuff of Memorial
Stadium, where the stalwart sons ol
Blue and Red will collide for the s'srd
time tomorrow afternoon, another
group of toiler;; will be plying their
multifarious trades in that unique
American institution known as the
press box.
And they won't be working a mere
GU-minute day such as the gridders
below. The press box day starts
early in the morning, when the lirst
crews ol technicians arrive to per
form the mysterious tasks which
make possible the afternoon radio
casts and telecasts.
It will end only when the Berkeley
dusk throws a blanket over the last
sheet of copy in the last typewriter.
In between times "the box" will be
humming with an intensity rivaling
thut on the field itself. Though the
bodily contact might be missing,
there are no times-out, no substitu
tions, in the press box.
Writers from every paper in the
area, plus representatives of the
major wire services, will be on hand
to record the events on the gridiron.
'lheir typewriters will be clattering
incessantly from long before game
time till long after, busy at the work
of producing Sunday's headline
stories.
Western Union Heady
From the typewriters the reams of
copy will be delivered to a long line

of Western Union operators, thence
over the wires and onto the presses
all in an amazingly short time after
the actual action on the field.
Then there'll be the men with the
head sets, taking advantage of their
bird's-eye view to diagnose the play
below arid telephone crisp instruc
tions to their respective benches.
Games have been won and lost in the
press box in just such a manner. .
The scouts of future opponents
won't I>♦ * lacking, either.
experts from the Big Ten will chart
Cal's every move; and if the game
were being played earlier in the sea-*
son, these diagnosticians would lie
nearly as numerous as the represen
tatives of the press.
Statisticians Important
Another important job will be that
of the statisticians who not only re
cord, compute, and tabulate the grid
goings-on, but who also deliver the

completed and already - mimeo
graphed statistics to the writers with
in a few minutes after the end of each
quarter.
There will also lie some wonderful
people who will distribute sand
wiches, cokes, and hot coffee at half
time.
Lord of the press box manor at
Memorial Stadium is Norrie West,
Cal's director of publicity, who will
act as official host to the writers, ra
dio men, visiting scouts, and just
plain guests.
West is also the master organizer
who integrates the many functions
of the press box into a single,
.smoothly-functioning unit.
So when you hear the game broad
cast, view the telecast, or read Sun
day's newsprint account of the 1950
Big Game, you can grant a silent vote
of thanks to Cal's Mr. West.

experts from the Big Ten will chart
Cal's every move; and if the game
were being played earlier in the sea-*
son, these diagnosticians would lie
nearly as numerous as the represen
tatives of the press.
Statisticians Important
Another important job will be that
of the statisticians who not only re
cord, compute, and tabulate the grid
goings-on, but who also deliver the

completed and already - mimeo
graphed statistics to the writers with
in a few minutes after the end of each
quarter.
There will also lie some wonderful
people who will distribute sand
wiches, cokes, and hot coffee at half
time.
Lord of the press box manor at
Memorial Stadium is Norrie West,
Cal's director of publicity, who will
act as official host to the writers, ra
dio men, visiting scouts, and just
plain guests.
West is also the master organizer
who integrates the many functions
of the press box into a single,
.smoothly-functioning unit.
So when you hear the game broad
cast, view the telecast, or read Sun
day's newsprint account of the 1950
Big Game, you can grant a silent vote
of thanks to Cal's Mr. West.
High above the tuff of Memorial
Stadium, where the stalwart sons ol
Blue and Red will collide for the s'srd
time tomorrow afternoon, another
group of toiler;; will be plying their
multifarious trades in that unique
American institution known as the
press box.
And they won't be working a mere
GU-minute day such as the gridders
below. The press box day starts
early in the morning, when the lirst
crews ol technicians arrive to per
form the mysterious tasks which
make possible the afternoon radio
casts and telecasts.
It will end only when the Berkeley
dusk throws a blanket over the last
sheet of copy in the last typewriter.
In between times "the box" will be
humming with an intensity rivaling
thut on the field itself. Though the
bodily contact might be missing,
there are no times-out, no substitu
tions, in the press box.
Writers from every paper in the
area, plus representatives of the
major wire services, will be on hand
to record the events on the gridiron.
'lheir typewriters will be clattering
incessantly from long before game
time till long after, busy at the work
of producing Sunday's headline
stories.
Western Union Heady
From the typewriters the reams of
copy will be delivered to a long line

of Western Union operators, thence
over the wires and onto the presses
all in an amazingly short time after
the actual action on the field.
Then there'll be the men with the
head sets, taking advantage of their
bird's-eye view to diagnose the play
below arid telephone crisp instruc
tions to their respective benches.
Games have been won and lost in the
press box in just such a manner. .
