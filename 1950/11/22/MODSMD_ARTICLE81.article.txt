# Eleven Varsity Standouts Will Battle California For Final Time in Memorial Stadium Saturday
## 
### EARL ODELL 
For some of them, there'll be an
other chance after Saturday. They
can tel'h themselves, "If w<• don't win
this time, we're sure to get 'em next
year."
For others, this is it! Guys that
have played against Cal until they
were ready to drop. Guys that liavt*
gone into a game here in the bowl
or over at Berkeley with so much
spirit that it made them sick to lose
by so little. These are the guys who
are going to hit the Berkeley turf
Saturday with a "Now or never"
phrase on their lips that has mean
ing.
We could list their names, give

them a pat on the back, and say,
"Good luck, fellows; this is your last
game, so get in there and fight." But
we don't think that would make men
like Russ Pomeroy, Gordy White,
Bob White, or Bruce Van Alstyne
play any harder.
They know this is it, the last
chace to walk away from a Bear
with that ole win feeling.
Gordy White will probably never
forget the fumble he fell on in the
'48 Big Game; we'll lay a small wager
that Bobby White isn't likely to for
get some of those runs he made
against those "untouchable" Bears;
and Russ Pomeroy undoubtedly re
members the big, bad Cal lines.
They've all got memories even if
they're only from sitting on the bench
and watching the boys stagger in and
out and wishing they could give them
some of their energy.

Maybe this sounds like a tear
jerker. Maybe it is a tear-jerker;
but if you don't believe us, just ask
some of the boys how they feel. They
might not tell you, but they're doing
a lot of thinking nevertheless.
Your list of "last chance" men
isn't complete without the names of
Tom Shaw, Dick Abraham, Boyd
Benson, Dick Broome, Don En berg,
Wes Foulson, and Bob Scott. Some
of the eleven departees haven't
seen a lot of Big Game action, but
they lived them just like the rest,
and they feel the same way about
Saturday's game.
Not being a senior and not having
played football for Stanford, much
less played in a Big Game, it's diffi
cult. to say, but it's our theory that
these seniors are going into the 53rd
Big Game with the feeling ol seeking

a last reprieve, not from the student
body but from themselves. It would
probably be tough to watch the next
Big Game from the stands, knowing
they'll never have another chance.
What are we going to say to the
boys? We know it's their last oppor
tunity, but they are no doubt well
aware of that fact. As for the pat on
the back, we don't think that is going
to apur the boys to greater heights.
We don't think the boys are going
to need those little touches—they've
got all the reason they need to hit
'em harder.
For some of them, there'll be an
other chance after Saturday. They
can tel'h themselves, "If w<• don't win
this time, we're sure to get 'em next
year."

'48 Big Game; we'll lay a small wager
that Bobby White isn't likely to for
get some of those runs he made
against those "untouchable" Bears;
and Russ Pomeroy undoubtedly re
members the big, bad Cal lines.
They've all got memories even if
they're only from sitting on the bench
and watching the boys stagger in and
out and wishing they could give them
some of their energy.

Maybe this sounds like a tear
jerker. Maybe it is a tear-jerker;
but if you don't believe us, just ask
some of the boys how they feel. They
might not tell you, but they're doing
a lot of thinking nevertheless.
Your list of "last chance" men
isn't complete without the names of
Tom Shaw, Dick Abraham, Boyd
Benson, Dick Broome, Don En berg,
Wes Foulson, and Bob Scott. Some
of the eleven departees haven't
seen a lot of Big Game action, but
they lived them just like the rest,
and they feel the same way about
Saturday's game.
Not being a senior and not having
played football for Stanford, much
less played in a Big Game, it's diffi
cult. to say, but it's our theory that
these seniors are going into the 53rd
Big Game with the feeling ol seeking

a last reprieve, not from the student
body but from themselves. It would
probably be tough to watch the next
Big Game from the stands, knowing
they'll never have another chance.
What are we going to say to the
boys? We know it's their last oppor
tunity, but they are no doubt well
aware of that fact. As for the pat on
the back, we don't think that is going
to apur the boys to greater heights.
We don't think the boys are going
to need those little touches—they've
got all the reason they need to hit
'em harder.
For some of them, there'll be an
other chance after Saturday. They
can tel'h themselves, "If w<• don't win
this time, we're sure to get 'em next
year."
For others, this is it! Guys that
have played against Cal until they
were ready to drop. Guys that liavt*
gone into a game here in the bowl
or over at Berkeley with so much
spirit that it made them sick to lose
by so little. These are the guys who
are going to hit the Berkeley turf
Saturday with a "Now or never"
phrase on their lips that has mean
ing.
We could list their names, give

them a pat on the back, and say,
"Good luck, fellows; this is your last
game, so get in there and fight." But
we don't think that would make men
like Russ Pomeroy, Gordy White,
Bob White, or Bruce Van Alstyne
play any harder.
They know this is it, the last
chace to walk away from a Bear
with that ole win feeling.
Gordy White will probably never
forget the fumble he fell on in the
'48 Big Game; we'll lay a small wager
that Bobby White isn't likely to for
get some of those runs he made
against those "untouchable" Bears;
and Russ Pomeroy undoubtedly re
members the big, bad Cal lines.
