# Axe Sharpened for Turkey and Oskie
## 
### RALPH HANDY 
It's been a long, long time
since Big Game and Thanksgiv
ing were stewed together in the
Farm kettle. But this year stu
dents will still be digesting tur
key as they head for the Berke
ley stadium.
The last time was hack in the
Phoney War days of 1939. Frankie
Albert was an obscure single-wing
half. Draft talk was in the air, and
FDR had done Herbert Hoover one
better and given the country not only
a chicken but two turkeys in every
pot. It was the year the Democrats
had their Thanksgiving early. Re
publicans had theirs a week later.
Elephant Beats Donkey
Big Game came on Saturday fol
lowing the Democrats' Nov. 23 ver
sion of Thanksgiving. But Stanford,
a hotbed of conservatism and the Re
publicans' Peninsula stronghold,
celebrated Thanksgiving in the old
established manner one week later
and didn't let this early "New Deal
Thanksgiving" gum up the Big Game
works.
But things arc different on the
Farm this Thanksgiving. Republi
cans and Democrats have agreed on
the calendar, if nothing else, and this
year Big Game won't find any GOP
Thanksgiving to hide behind.
"It just happened," was the way
Director of Athletics A 1 Masters ex
pressed the coincidence of Big Game
and Thanksgiving.
Schedule Three Years Old
"These schedules were made up
three and a half years ago at a meet
ing of Coast Conference represen
tatives and there's nothing we can do
about it now," Masters said.
The conflict between Big Game and
Thanksgiving has created numerous
problems for Cardinals, the organiza
tion in charge of Big Game prepara
tions. The program may read "Stan
ford versus Cal," but Cardinals is
lighting a game of its own—Big Game
activities versus family Thanksgiv
ings.
Such divided loyalties were ap
parently no problem at the turn of
the century, when the Big Game was
played on Thanksgiving Day itself.
The Axe Yell had already been
coined and the Axe stolen, but float
parades, Gaieties, and lakebed ral
lies were unheard-of. And the co
incidencc of two of the biggest events
of the fall season caused no more
than a passing comment back in the
days when a field goal counted for
five points and 17,000 attendance at
a football game was a crowd.


WHO'S GOT THE AXE?—The boys from the Farm haven't
quite been able to get their hands on it since the '47 Big Game.
Above, Cal claims the Axe, which she has kept for three years
straight.


WHO'S GONNA GET IT?—lt's anybody's guess in the game
where the famed causus belli is at stake. Maybe this year the
Axe will be returned to its original home, where, in the spring
of 1899, the Axe Yell was born. Above, Governor Earl Warren
hands the trophy to Stanford at the end of the '46 battle. The
vicious symbol was introduced in the course of baseball ri
valry with the school across the Bay.


THE VAGRANT AXE—Palo Alto police sergeant Dale Atwood holds the Axe and the plaque on
which it is now mounted following its return in October 1946 after one of the many thefts of the
trophy. The head of the Axe was detachcd from the handle the first time the instrument was pur
loined in 1899, when Cal men had it cut off to make it easier to hide. Stealing the Axo is now
punishable by expulsion and is no longer the honorable achievement it was then and in tho days
of the Immortal 21 who finally, in 1930, rescued il from Berkeley.


RESTING PLACE—Stanfordites mill about the site on which the Axe rests in a showcase when it
is on the Farm. It was from this spot in the Cellar that the Berkeleyites last took the symbol of
school rivalry.

Such divided loyalties were ap
parently no problem at the turn of
the century, when the Big Game was
played on Thanksgiving Day itself.
The Axe Yell had already been
coined and the Axe stolen, but float
parades, Gaieties, and lakebed ral
lies were unheard-of. And the co
incidencc of two of the biggest events
of the fall season caused no more
than a passing comment back in the
days when a field goal counted for
five points and 17,000 attendance at
a football game was a crowd.


WHO'S GOT THE AXE?—The boys from the Farm haven't
quite been able to get their hands on it since the '47 Big Game.
Above, Cal claims the Axe, which she has kept for three years
straight.


WHO'S GONNA GET IT?—lt's anybody's guess in the game
where the famed causus belli is at stake. Maybe this year the
Axe will be returned to its original home, where, in the spring
of 1899, the Axe Yell was born. Above, Governor Earl Warren
hands the trophy to Stanford at the end of the '46 battle. The
vicious symbol was introduced in the course of baseball ri
valry with the school across the Bay.


THE VAGRANT AXE—Palo Alto police sergeant Dale Atwood holds the Axe and the plaque on
which it is now mounted following its return in October 1946 after one of the many thefts of the
trophy. The head of the Axe was detachcd from the handle the first time the instrument was pur
loined in 1899, when Cal men had it cut off to make it easier to hide. Stealing the Axo is now
punishable by expulsion and is no longer the honorable achievement it was then and in tho days
of the Immortal 21 who finally, in 1930, rescued il from Berkeley.


RESTING PLACE—Stanfordites mill about the site on which the Axe rests in a showcase when it
is on the Farm. It was from this spot in the Cellar that the Berkeleyites last took the symbol of
school rivalry.
It's been a long, long time
since Big Game and Thanksgiv
ing were stewed together in the
Farm kettle. But this year stu

Phoney War days of 1939. Frankie
Albert was an obscure single-wing

a chicken but two turkeys in every

Elephant Beats Donkey
Big Game came on Saturday fol
lowing the Democrats' Nov. 23 ver
sion of Thanksgiving. But Stanford,
a hotbed of conservatism and the Re
publicans' Peninsula stronghold,
celebrated Thanksgiving in the old
established manner one week later
and didn't let this early "New Deal
Thanksgiving" gum up the Big Game
works.
But things arc different on the
Farm this Thanksgiving. Republi
cans and Democrats have agreed on
the calendar, if nothing else, and this
year Big Game won't find any GOP
Thanksgiving to hide behind.

Director of Athletics A 1 Masters ex
pressed the coincidence of Big Game
and Thanksgiving.

"These schedules were made up
three and a half years ago at a meet

about it now," Masters said.
The conflict between Big Game and
Thanksgiving has created numerous
problems for Cardinals, the organiza
