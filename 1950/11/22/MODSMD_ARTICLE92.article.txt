# Bonfire Rally to Let Off Big Game Heat
## 
### DONN BYRNE 
Fifty-two years ago the girls of
Roble, the old Roble, were hav
ing the Big Game rally in their
living room.
It was in the midst of those jolly
festivities of 1898, that students de
cided the room was too small and
the rally should be moved outside.
Once outside, the girls were still not
satisfied; they were so-o-o-o cold.
To the rescue came a few Zetes, piled
up some barrels, and started a bon
fire.
The oldest Big Game tradition was
begun.
l!)0ft Turkey Scramble
This tradition grew with the years.
In 1900 there was a Thanksgiving
game, just like this year. The rally
was held with the men and women
seated separately. Then they "ad
journed to the baseball field" for the
bonfire, gayly singing "Rush the Ball
Along" and "For Dear Old Stanford."
Cal's Big "C" Fence was turned in
the fire in '04 in retaliation for the
Axe theft of five years before. Inner
Quad was the scene of the blaze in
11.
In both '25 and '28 the pile was set
off prematurely by raiders from the
north. Each time classes were dis
missed, and the entire student body
pitched in to build it back from
scratch. Those were the days the old
timers refer to as real Stanford spirit.
Wood and Flu
Depression was the keynote of 1932
and wood was scarce Influenza
struck the freshman class. In spite
of all these troubles, the student body
managed to have a bonfire rally as
spirited as ever.
There wasn't a fire in '33. It seems
there was too much excitement down
in San Jose, where a crowd of 20,000
lynched two slayers.
The Axe was at the rally for the
first time in '35. Doodles Weaver was
in his prime, and 10,000 rooters saw
the fire. In '36 a Cal time bomb plot
was thwarted. In '39 the old Paly-
Stanford Toonerville Trolley was
burned by the excited students.
Service was "discontinued."
IVorchant Marine, Fire
Even without a Big Game, the war
years saw bonfire rallies. One was
held before the Stanford-Merchant
Marine game.
Last year we saw a model Cam
panile burn atop the 65-foot pyre that
was reputed to be the biggest bon
fire of all. Elaborate guarding sys
tems have been set up to keep out
the marauding sons of California, and
last year the campus was protected by
walkie-talkies, road blocks, patrol
cars, and frosh guards on duty at all
times. This year those precautions
are being repeated. •
Thursday night at Lake Lagunita
there will be Stanford songs, and
yells, and speeches. There'll be the
Stanford team, and the Band, and
rooters of all ages. Then as the cere
monies draw to a close, a torch will
ignite the huge pile of wood. And
for the fifty-second time Stanford
spirit will soar as the Big Game Bon
fire blazes!


THE GAME PYRE BURNS—The big moment of the Big Game
rally comes as thousands of heads turn to see the towering
flames. Behind the fire, colorful Roman candles stream against
the sky. Stanford spirit soars with the flames as the Dirty Golden
Bear sizzles in effigy. It's a great night for the Cardinal.


BEACON IN THE NIGHT—The bonfire which illumines the
Lagunita lakebed can be seen from the Berkeley hills on a clear
night. The Big Game rally fire on the California campus is held
in the outdoor Greek Theater.


THE BiG NIGHT ARRIVES—The bonfire is completed. Crowds
fill the dry lakebed of Lagunita. The Stanford varsity is intro
duced, the band plays, the speeches are made, the Axe Yell is
given.


'54 DOES THE WORK—The enormous stacks ot patiently-gathered wood soon dwindle as the
lads of the frosh class begin to throw the wood, piece by piece, on the pyre. They work day and
night to make a fitting crematorium for Brother Bear. Wood was taken from the destroyed Alpha
Salvatierra House, Safeway Stores, and any other available source. Long lines of boys lead up the
slanting sides as countless slats and boards and limbs pass from hand to hand and on up to the top.
Last year the top was 65 feet from the ground. Frosh are alert for cries of "Watch out for the
nails!" or "Here comes a big one!"


STOP-INSPECTION!—During the days preceding the Big
Game, no one barrels onto the campus without undergoing the
close scrutiny of the freshman watchdogs. It isn't a good idea to
be caught without a student body card or to carry blue paint in
your car. And heaven help the Oskie lover who just happens to
wander down the Peninsula. The main goal of the invaders is
the bonfire. Only a few times in past, in '25 and '28, for instance,
have they been able to set off the blaze early. The class of '54
is determined not to add this year to the fatality list.
