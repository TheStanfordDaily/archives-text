# BOMBS MISSED BONFIRE
## 
### 
Probably one of the most drastic
attempts Cal has made to set off
Stanford's bonfire prematurely was
in 1921 when two California air
planes tried unsuccessfully to bomb
the pile of wood the day before the
game.
The planes, each having a large
red "S" painted on it, circled the
campus several times late in the
afternoon and then proceeded to
the bonfire site, where they dropped
two bombs, both of which landed
within 50 feet of the target.
One of the bombs burst into
flames, but the fire was extin
guished.
