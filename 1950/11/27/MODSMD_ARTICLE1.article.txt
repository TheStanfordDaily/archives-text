# INDIANS BLAST 'SUPER-CAL' MYTH, 7-7
## 
### 

GOODBYE JIM AND PETE—The California rooting section paid
tribute to their departing captains Jim Monachino and Pete Scha
barum in a half-time card stunt Saturday. This was one of many
outstanding stunts performed during the afternoon. A Cal ac
tion stunt showed a Bear beside a cannon. Some C cards be
came flashes of red and orange and then a jubilant Oskie began
jumping over a prostrate Indian. Then came a grinning Injun
with a gold feather in his hair; Oskie bending over a fallen In
dian; and a Christmas seal of red and green. They climaxed, the
performance with a poem, "Roses are red and Stanford is too,
We Win Big Cames, What about you?" Stanford started with a
big "S," a 'Big Game 1950," a red axe in a field of blue, and the
score of the game at the half.


HE'S OVER—On the first play of the fourth, after an Axe Yell,'
Gary Kerkorian neatly dropped a flat pass into the arms of Boyd
Benson (12), after which the latter scored Stanford's lone TD.

Vainly attempting to stop him was Dick LemMon (89), while Les
Richter (67), Joe Wardlaw (68), and Bob Forbes (26) of Cal, and
Card Skip Crist (21) looked on.


OUCHli!—This pre-game live tackling practice by the Stanford
Indians was an indication of the savageness which the Big Red
Machine later exhibited in holding the vaunted Cal running at
tack to only one touchdown. It was reminiscent of a similar ex
hibition by Army when they drubbed Stanford in 1948. This is
one of the first live practice drills the Stanford team has ever
shown the student body. Card linemen Cone, Manoogian, and
White showed the effects of the drill as they smashed the Cal
offensive backfield.
