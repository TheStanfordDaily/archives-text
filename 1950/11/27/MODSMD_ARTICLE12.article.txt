### 
A banquet of real bear meat will |
climax Big Game celebrations to- i
night when the team and coaches i
meet in the Papagayo Room of San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel for what |
could be called a "moral victory" !
dinner.
The team isn't too happy about j
the moral victory label. They feel
they should have won Saturday's i
Came. Bill McColl, who played one
of the finest games of his career
against the Bears, thought he spoke |
for the team when he said just that
and described the atmosphere in |
Stanford's post-game dressing room i
as far from jubilant.
Others Are Ilapp.v
But among rooters, alumni, and
Stanford boosters there was rrjoic- j
ing and joyous celebration for un
derdog Stanford's showing against I
California.
Co-captain Russ Pomcroy got the j
game ball. He emerged from the j
group of players who had tracked
down Cal's final play, running for !
the dressing room, the ball tucked
under his arm.
Benson (lets Smacked
Meanwhile, Boyd Benson, who I
scored Stanford's lone touchdown, |
posed obligingly for photographers, j
embracing a Stanford coed, and
Rally Com girls kissed yell leaders
and roughs.
Many rooters and the Stanford
band remained on the field for a
half-hour or more after the game. '
and then broke up for living group
parties scattered over the area to
continue the merry-making.
The parties, as elaborate as any
in past years, included one in Car
mrl, from and to which the party
goers were transported by plane.
Celebration Reaches Peak
The celebrating, which reached
its peak Saturday night, climaxed a
week of Big Game actvities. The
freshmen, after several false starts,
lit the traditional bonfire Thursday
night at Lake Lagunita.
Bob Scobey and his "Alexander's
Jazz Band" entertained at the rally.
Ernie Nevcrs, former Stanford
Ail-American fullback, then spoke
and came pretty close to the final
score when he predicted a seven to
six Stanford victory.
Shortage at Rosso! (is
The crowd at Rosotti's for the
' rally Friday afternoon was so large
that the proprietors ran out of re
freshments. The Phi Dclt umi DU
bands were on hand with their
music.
The Stanford band, R. r > strong in
| full uniform, plus five yell leaders,
' made their traditional trip to Sati
Francisco Friday night, where they
I interrupted floor shows and radio
] broadcasts at the Fairmont and
J Mark Hopkins Hotels with their
j music and yells.
Then the panic, the celebrations,
I and the morning after.
