### 
TOKYO, Monday, Nov. 27 (UP) â€”
A Communist counterattack that
drove 14 miles through United Na
tions lines stalled Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur's end-the-war offensive
in Korea today, but United States
Marines rushed westward from the
Chosin reservoir to stem the enemy
assault.
Simultaneously air reconnaissance
reports said Chinese Reds were
streaming across the Manchurian
border into North Korea in at least
one area.
A late dispatch from the front
sector said the Communists tore a
gap more than seven miles wide in
the center of the Allied line yester
day and were pouring southward.
