Coach Pappy Waldorf's "Super-Cal" gridiron myth, which car
ried the Bears through 22 straight Pacific Coast Conference vic
tories, was ended abruptly Saturday by a fighting, determined
Stanford team that refused to be beaten.
On a turf that was still soft from more than a week of rain, Stan-

ford's aerial-minded Indians played
the highly-favored Californians to a
7 to 7 draw before an overflow crowd
of 81,000 persons in Berkeley's Me
morial Stadium.
The 53rd Stanford-California grid
brittle wan one of the greatest in Big
Game history and the sellout crowd
was kept on its feet throughout most
of the thrilling contest.
Nobody Happy
Neither team seemed happy with
the outcome of the game.
Tlie embarrassed Bears, called the
greatest California tram of them all
by some observers, were disappointed
in their showing, while the underdog
Indians, tired of moral victories, fig
ured that they had actually outplayed
the supposedly powerful California
team.
And if it wore not for a couple of
bad breaks, â€¢ the inspired Cardinal
team would have had a scoreboard
victory.
Midway in the third quarter. Staf
ford had the ball 3 down and 7 yards
to go on the California 28-yard line.
Quarterback Gary Kerkorian, who
had a magnificent day, faded back
and lofted a beautiful touchdown pass
to Halfback Bob White, who caught it
easily in the end zone.
