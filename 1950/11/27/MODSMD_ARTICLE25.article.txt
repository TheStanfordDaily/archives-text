# A 						Game to Talk About
## 
### 
They'll be talkir ibout that one for a long
lime. They'll be talking about the fearless '50
team that had the Army and Cal shaking in
their collective pants.
They'll be talking about the way Jess Cone,
187 pound guard, brushed through giant line
men, threw Cal quarterback Jim Marinos for
loss after loss.
They'll be talking about the way Cal's three
musketeers limped to their feet after being hit
Ly dynamic Russ Pomeroy.
A'td most of all they'll be talking about All-
American Bill McColl's one-handed snag of a
i'/t foot high pass and his "60-yard plus" pass
which must be a record of some kind or an
olhc.r even though it wasn't caught.
They'll be talking about Stanford's celebrat
ing students who Friday night made the Cal
undergrade look like losers before the game
even started, as they yelled from one San Fran
cisco hotel to another.
They'll also try to tell you it was a moral vic
tory for Stanford. This is not true. The score
was a tie, and the team members will tell you
they were not satisfied with the tie, but wanted
the victory.
Bat the Big Game was a victory for Stanford

in a different sense. The fans sensed the ex
cellent coaching that prompted our linemen to
charge defensively from a different spot â€”
throwing off the Cal blocking angles. The stu
dents saw an assortment of pass patterns work
because of a physically fit set of pass receivers
who have missed many games.
The saw a Stanford line play fc equal to or
better than a California line which was hitherto
called "best in the nation."
In short the Stanford Family won a victory of
confidence in their team, coach, and in them
selves.
Any high school football star who sat in the
stands watching the Big Red outfight the Berke
ley Bear shouldn't have any trouble deciding
which university he wants to play football for.
Any alumnus, who could hold back dona
tions which he had planned for the Stanford
Fund, on the basis of malcontent with the
coaching staff, would have to hang his head
after he saw our men giving everything for
their coach and for Stanford.
Yes, they'll be talking about this Big Game
and this Stanford team with the great teams in
the history of the Big Game.
