(SPECIAL TO THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRON
ICLE: Attn.: Bill Lie-ser.
A red hot, fighting California football team, unques
tionably the best eleven in (1) the Coast, (2), the
country, (3) in California history, of all tin-";-

was plagued by bad breaks today
in the annual Big Game and, thus,
was tied by a spiritless, inept, band
of Stanford Indians.
The Indians, trembling before
the mighty, invincible power of
liit' great, great, great SUPER-Cal
organization—coached by the man
whom many consider to be the
n( xi President of the United States

the Indians had all the breaks and all the officiat
ing in the game.
Cal's scores came as the result of a roaring passing
attack led by Cal's All-American quarterback Jim
:Vf»rinos. The Brilliant Marinos—using a carefully re
hearsed play—worked his team to a first down on the
Stanlord ill. by the clever method of having a Stanford
back fumble. This, contrary to popular opinion, was
T'ot a "break" (the greatest team in California history
.shuns su -h things) but rather a carefully executed
pi jy.
Maiinos th<.n led his team into the Card end-zone
h; hi'iidinv, the- ball off to All-American Pete Scha
haium.
With C'al. then, rightfully ahead, the Indians got
another one of the amazingly lucky breaks that kept
lhem i;i the ballgame ail afternoon. All-American
Srhaharum, thinking the play was over, handed the
hall to an unidentified Stanford lineman, and the
i efertt as always pro-Stanford—railed it a fum
!>U and gave the Indians the ball.
'flic Indians, with only 3(i yards to go to the Bears'
ind z: ne, were somehow able to score after the tre
r.i ndous Pappy Waldorf (an all-time All-American)
bad in :> fit. of kindness—inserted the third string

Rambler squad. It was one on some kind of pass
play from an unidentified Stanford quarterback to an
ineligible Card receiver, whose name we didn't catch.
The officials, after conferring with Waldorf, de
cided to let Stanford have the TD, because Cali
fornia is noted for being such fine sports.
Thus the game was tied up. We didn't catch the final
score, but the greatest team in Cal history was cer
tainly robbed today.
Led by all-time Ail-American Les Richter, who
would have done better if he hadn't been hurt all
season, and All-American Jim Monachino, the Bears
were superb. They may have been a little off their
game today and certainly had all the bad breaks.
By the way. Stanford did have a touchdown called
hack in the third quarter, but this—if it had been
allowed—would have had no bearing on the game's
outcome, as the great, great, great, great, great, great,
great, great, great, great Super-Cal machine would
have undoubtedly scored some more if the occasion
had detnandt d it.

Hull Session has voted Chronicle Sports Editor Bill
Lie-ser the Saceky Award as being "unquestionably
the most incompetent sports writer in America today
(high school writers excepted.)" Mr. Lie-ser be

the title in yesterday's Chron.
(Having won the award in If) 48 (for his Big Game
story), in 194!) (for his Big Game story), and again
this year, Mr. Lie-ser now retains permanent posses

sportswriter I'rescott Sullivan's Big Game storj—
probably one of trie better stories ever written.
(In fact, we think, Sullivan's story has been sur
passed. on the Coast, by only one game story: Sulli

Lie-ser will find time for study of the document.)

ICLE: Attn.: Bill Lie-ser.
A red hot, fighting California football team, unques
tionably the best eleven in (1) the Coast, (2), the
country, (3) in California history, of all tin-";-

was plagued by bad breaks today
in the annual Big Game and, thus,
was tied by a spiritless, inept, band
of Stanford Indians.
The Indians, trembling before
the mighty, invincible power of
liit' great, great, great SUPER-Cal
organization—coached by the man
whom many consider to be the
n( xi President of the United States

the Indians had all the breaks and all the officiat
ing in the game.
Cal's scores came as the result of a roaring passing
attack led by Cal's All-American quarterback Jim
:Vf»rinos. The Brilliant Marinos—using a carefully re
hearsed play—worked his team to a first down on the
Stanlord ill. by the clever method of having a Stanford
back fumble. This, contrary to popular opinion, was
T'ot a "break" (the greatest team in California history
.shuns su -h things) but rather a carefully executed
pi jy.
Maiinos th<.n led his team into the Card end-zone
h; hi'iidinv, the- ball off to All-American Pete Scha
haium.
With C'al. then, rightfully ahead, the Indians got
another one of the amazingly lucky breaks that kept
lhem i;i the ballgame ail afternoon. All-American
Srhaharum, thinking the play was over, handed the
hall to an unidentified Stanford lineman, and the
i efertt as always pro-Stanford—railed it a fum
!>U and gave the Indians the ball.
'flic Indians, with only 3(i yards to go to the Bears'
ind z: ne, were somehow able to score after the tre
r.i ndous Pappy Waldorf (an all-time All-American)
bad in :> fit. of kindness—inserted the third string

Rambler squad. It was one on some kind of pass
play from an unidentified Stanford quarterback to an
ineligible Card receiver, whose name we didn't catch.
The officials, after conferring with Waldorf, de
cided to let Stanford have the TD, because Cali
fornia is noted for being such fine sports.
Thus the game was tied up. We didn't catch the final
score, but the greatest team in Cal history was cer
tainly robbed today.
Led by all-time Ail-American Les Richter, who
would have done better if he hadn't been hurt all
season, and All-American Jim Monachino, the Bears
were superb. They may have been a little off their
game today and certainly had all the bad breaks.
By the way. Stanford did have a touchdown called
hack in the third quarter, but this—if it had been
allowed—would have had no bearing on the game's
outcome, as the great, great, great, great, great, great,
great, great, great, great Super-Cal machine would
have undoubtedly scored some more if the occasion
had detnandt d it.
