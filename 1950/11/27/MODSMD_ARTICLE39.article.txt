# Pre-Medical Students Meet Competitors in Fraternity
## 
### SHIRLEY GABBERT 
Believe it or not, there is one time
when Stanford pre-meds gather in
a spirit of friendliness rather than
one of cut-throat competition.
Mutual animosity as contestants
for the all-too-few places in first
yeÂ«.r medical classes is relaxed and
common interests shared when stu
dents meet at functions of Stan
ford's pre-medical fraternity, Sigma
Pi Sigma.
Until this fall, the group was
known as "Skulls." Recent reor
ganization and re-activation, in
cluding re-writing of the constitu
tion, has made Sigma Pi Sigma
emerge as a ful-fledged Greek-let
ter honorary.
Lectures and Movies
The organizaton sponsors lectures
and movies on subjects of interest
to pre-medical students. Often the
speaker is one of the doctors from
the Stanford Medical School, whose
subject might be anything from the
latest theory for the cause of hard
ening of the arteries to how an
electro-cardiograph machine works.
This year Sigma Pi Sigma has al
ready sponsored one meeting pri
marily for lower division pre-meds.
Dr. David L. Bassett, anatomy in
structor for the first-year medical
class, gave the students a brief idea
of what that far-off goal of medical
school is like. He also answered
many questions about what an ad
missions board will consider impor
tant when it selects the members of
the first-year class.
Put Out Handbook
The group plans to put out a
handbook of "tips" for freshman
and sophomore pre-meds, with the
main emphasis on class program
planning. Often a lower division
pre-med will have as his adviser a
member of the Education or His
tory Department, who is unfamiliar
with the courses required of pre

j meds. Because of this perhaps as
| much as because of his own lack
'of foresight, the unlucky student
| sometimes ends up in his junior
j year taking organic chemistry,
quantitative analysis, and embryol
ogy all at the same time.
Sigma Pi Sigma hopes the pro
i posed handbook will help eliminate
I this, and other difficulties for pre
! meds.
Membership Limited
Membership in the. group is lim
ited to 65, and selection is on the
basis of grade-point averages and
interest shown in the organization.
A student must have attended Stan
lord for at least one quarter before
he is eligible for membership.
A list of all pre-meds is kept for
| mailing information and for mem
! bership purposes. However, it is
impossible to compile a complete
list because upper division pre-
I meds are often listed as psychology
; or history majors rather than as
j pre-meds.
For this reason, students.interest
ed in learning more about Sigma Pi
Sigma should contact some member
I of the group personally. Don Stew
| art, president, can be reached at
j Stern Hall.
