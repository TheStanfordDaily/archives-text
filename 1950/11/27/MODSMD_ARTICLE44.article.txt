# Indians Jubilant, Bears Not, After Tie
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Officially there was no winner, no loser, in Saturday's thrilling
53rd Big Game. And logically, a tie score is supposed to mean
that one team has as much to cheer about as the other.
Not so at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium, where Stanford's under
dog Indians—showing the effects of some superb coaching and a

roster unimpaired for the first time
by injuries — had just matched
points with a California team rated
by many as the greatest in Berke
ley history.
The atmosphere of gloom on the
Bears' side hung heavy and hard.
The gridders went mechanically
about the task of changing into their
street clothes, and managed only
feeble grins for Coach Pappy Wal
dorf as the portly mentor made the
rounds congratulating his individ
ual performers.
Deathly Silence
There was plenty of noise outside,
though, where thousands of Cal
rooters had gathered to cheer for
Pappy, team captains Jim Mona
chino and Pete Schabarum, and to
give a big twelve for the Bear var
sity. The racket only accentuated
the lack of enthusiasm inside the
dressing room.
The Bears, who voted unani
mously a few moments after the
game to accept a Rose Bowl bid if
proferred, were likewise unani
mous in their praise of the Stanford
team. Quarterback Jim Marinos
spoke for the team when he sug
gested that the Indians had not
played over their heads in their
surprising showing.
Up to Potential
"Stanford simply played the game
it was capable of. And that was
plenty good."
Pappy, meanwhile, accepted the
congratulations of Cal's President
Sproul ("I'm with you, sir. You
were fine!") by telling the stately
head of the world's largest univer
sity that the credit belonged to the
boys.
Then Pappy too praised the Stan
ford team. Pie tabbed the Indians
as the finest team Cal has met all
year and the only one seriously to
penetrate Cal's pass defense.
'A Million Passes'
"They must have thrown a mil
lion passes. And I don't remember
anyone getting behind Dick Lem-
Mon before. That McColl must have
jumped six feet in the air to catch
one pass in front of the bench. We
have probably played better ball
this year; but we're willing to give
Stanford all the credit. It was a
fine ball game."
Pappy wouldn't admit either that
the loss of safety man Cal Van
Heuitt might have impaired the
Bear defenders. But he did say he
wouldn't trade his linebacker Les
Richter for Stanford's Russ Pom

eroy. ("I'd like to have both of \
them.")
On the south rim of the stadium, I
Stanford's dressing room was key- j
noted by horseplay, back-slapping, j
and general good humor as the |
gridders were unable to contain |
their justifiable pride in a game
well conceived and well played.
'Had to Gamble'
Coach Marchie Schwartz said
simply, "We knew we couldn't run
against the Cal defense. We had to
gamble and it worked."
.Quarterback Gary Kerkorian,
who completed 17 for 31 passes in
playing his finest game, echoed
Marchie's sentiments.
"We couldn't run either side of j
the Cal line. It was pass or noth- |
ing."
. In answer to a question, Kerko
rian confided that the 60-yard pass
thrown by Bill McColl to Bobby j
Bryan, which came within inches of
winning for the Indians, had been
called from the bench.
Pomeroy, incidentally, captured I
the game ball from the referee fol
lowing the final gun.
