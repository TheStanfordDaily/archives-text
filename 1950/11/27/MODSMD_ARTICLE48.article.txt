# Ramblers Dump JV's In First Half Splurge
## 
### 
Stanford's only undefeated foot
ball team finally bit the dust Sat
urday as the Braves were trampled
on by the once-defeated Cal Ram- j
i biers, 20-7.
The first half of the battle was all '
Cal, which rolled to three touch
downs while blanking the Junior
! Cards.
The Ramblers struck quickly I
I when halfback Lukie Phillips scoot- !
ed over from the {our following a
j 7G-yard punt return by Henry Al- j
: fane, and QB Pat Gelardi con- I
I verted.
Alter stopping the Brave offense
' cold, the Ramblers scored again in
j the second when halfback Gary j
Radcliff gathered in a flat pass from
quarterback Chris Markey, cut di- |
! agonally across the field, and, be- 1
i hind beautiful blocking, raced 40

yards for the TD. Gelardi again
converted.
The Ramblers' final score came
in the final minutes of the first
half. They took control of the ball
from the Braves when Bill Thom
son recovered John Baker's fumble
on the Brave 34-yard line. Then,
with typical Cal power smashes, the
Berkeleyites moved the necessary
distance to the goal line,* being
stalled only momentarily when they
reached the lour - yard line. The
conversion attempt v/as no good.
The Braves' lone tally came fol
lowing the recovery of a Rambler
fumble when halfback Seotty Mc-
Kay hit pay dirt. Baker kicked the
extra point.
