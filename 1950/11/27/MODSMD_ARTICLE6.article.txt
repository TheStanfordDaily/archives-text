happened so fast he didn't know
exactly what happened. Steven
son was knocked unconscious

car on the highway and sent for
an ambulance.
Chandler and Boycr were taken
to Doctors' Hospital in San Jose,
but Stevenson was released.

shattered the windshield with their
heads, receiving fractured jaws,
broken noses, facial lacerations, and
losing several teeth.
