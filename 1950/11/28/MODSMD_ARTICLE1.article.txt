## Malik Backs China Communists in UN 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Nov. 27
(CP) â€” The Chinese Communists
took seats at the Unitdd Nations Se
ruritl Council for the first time to
day after that group decided, over
Russian objections, to lump debate
on Korea and Formosa.
Gen. Wu Hsiu-Chuan joined the
U-nation group at the end of the
horseshoe tahle after a two-and-a
half-hour debate in which Soviet
Defecate Jacob A. Malik tried in
vain to limit the agenda to Peking's
charges of American "aggression"
against Formosa.
The Council adjourned until to
morrow morning without solving
the issue, and Wu probably will
.speak sometime during the day.
