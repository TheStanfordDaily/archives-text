## 
### 
Bryan Green, famed evangelist from Birming
ham, England, will speak in Memorial Church
tomorrow as part of the week-long evangelistic
mission which he is conducting this week at
Grace Cathedral in San Francisco and Bay Area

♦•Episcopal Churches.
The dynamic, 48-year-old, Lon
don-born missioner is fresh from
missions in New York, Boston, Wash
ington, and Houston. He lias at
tracted record-breaking crowds
wherever he has spoken. In New
York for only seven days, he drew
42,000 enthusiastic listeners.
Conversion and Mission
Bryan Green, who is seldom called
Rev. or Mr., was converted at 16 and
conducted his first mission at 19. This
is the fifth time that Green has left
his own St. Martins in the Bull Ring
at Birmingham to come to speak in
, North America.
On previous trips, he has preached
in Canada, the Midwest, and has lec
tured to our troops in Germany. He
i specializes in work among high school
! and university students.
Luncheon and Tea
At Stanford, Green will be honored
at a luncheon and a tea. The tea will
be given by the Canterbury Club to
morrow afternoon at 3 at the home of
Professor and Mrs. E. T. Coman. The
luncheon will be Wednesday noon in
j the Garden Room at the Union Din
ing Hall. Anyone may come to either
1 the luncheon or the tea, but it neces
! sary that persons who wish to come
check in at the Church Vestry.
Green, considered England's top
| evangelist, Is in America "to help
people become Christians." He has
j said, "I cannot say there is a great
seeking toward religion in America.
! but I do believe there is a very real
turning toward faith."
Passionate and Contemptuous
Much of Green's success is due to
j his boundless energy. On the opening
■ day of his New York mission, he
preached seven times in six different
churches. His sermons arc alter
[ natcly relaxed and chatty and then
! passionate and contemptuous of
! "easy-going Christianity."
