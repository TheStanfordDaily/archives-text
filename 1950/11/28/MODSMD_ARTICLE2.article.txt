WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme
Court refused today to postpone ar
gument on the conspiracy convic
tion of 11 U.S. Communist party
leaders, but granted them permis
sion to employ a British lawyer.
The 11 had asked a delay in the
schedvdcd Dec. 4 hearing so D. N.
Pritt, former leftist member of the
House of Commons, would have
time to get to this country and help
argue their case.
