U.S. BTH ARMY HQ. KOREA,
Tuesday, Nov. 28 (UP) —United
Nations forces faced a major
military disaster in Korea today.
Military observers wore facing up
to the conclusion that China appar- |
entlv is prepared to pour in as much ,
of her inexhaustible supply of man- i
power as is necessary to keep the Al- i
lies from winning a decisive victory.
They estimated that 125,000 Chinese
Communist troops, not all of them
committed to the battle so far, had
reversed the biggest Allied offen
sive in Korea. And in so doing the
Communists were fighting without j
air support and a minimum of tank j
and artillery support.
"They're not afraid to die, and they |
are in no hurry to get home by i
Christmas," one officer at Bth Army j
headquarters commented bitterly.
The observers believed that, the |
only alternatives to what looked like
an endless sec-saw struggle in Ko- j
rea were a full-scale war against i
China—and the attendant possibility j
of touching off a third World War—
a withdrawal from the peninsula or a
"deal" at Lake Success, where Chi
nese Communist representatives
were appearing.
