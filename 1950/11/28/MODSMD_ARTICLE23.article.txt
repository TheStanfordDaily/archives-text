# Tie Means Cal Will Keep the Axe
## 
### 
"Cal will keep the Axe," Ted
Buttner said yesterday. Accord
ing to an agreement signed be
tween the two schools in 1934, "in
j rase of a tie the Axe remains with
the srhool that won the prered-
J ing game." Stanford lost the Axe |
in 1947 when Cal won a close vie- I
| tory by 21 to 18.
