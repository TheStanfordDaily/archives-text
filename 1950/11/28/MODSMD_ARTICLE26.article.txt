# Frosh to Hear Rushing Plans
## 
### 
Stanford's 24 fraternity presidents j
will visit Encina Hall tonight to ac- j
quaint freshmen with the Farm's ;
rushing program, which begins next
quarter.
Breaking down into groups of ]
four, the presidents will speak to
each wing and answer questions, j
This year's interfratemity magazine I
will be distributed to freshmen later 1
this week.
"We want to stress several impor- |
tant points," said Dave Larimer, â– 
president of Irtterfraternity Coun
cil. Foremost of these, he said, is,
"Be careful. When a man pledges,
he should be sure he's pledging the
right house. We want to cut down
on 'pledge jumping'."
Larimer pointed out that a fresh
man doesn't have to "panic" as soon
as he is asked to pledge. If a house
wants a man, he said, it will hold
the bid open until he makes up his
mind.
