# Crew Seeks Help In Moving Shells
## 
### 
Stanford crewmen have issued a
call to students who live in the
state of Washington for help in
transporting two new shells from
their birthplace in Seattle to the
Stanford campus for use during the
coming season.
Crew Captain Jim Fifer has asked
j students from Washington who are
| going home for Christmas by train
jto forego cheeking their baggage
I and turn the space over to the crew,
j which has established a "space ac
count" \oith the Southern Pacific
I Company.
Fifer said yesterday that baggage
| fees for the two shells amount to
J $400, the equivalent of the baggage
of approximately 27 students who
are willing to carry their bags in
stead of checking them.
He indicated that the space saved
would enable the SP to turn over a
portion of a baggage car to the
crew for shipping the boats here
! from Seattle.
Most of the $P>,200 required to
j build the shells was donated by the
! Stanford Club of Spokane and last
I year's senior class.
Interested students may contact
: Fifer at DA 3-8848 or Joan Wilson
jat Lagunita, if they have not al
| ready been seen by living group
I representatives.
