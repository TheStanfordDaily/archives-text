Stanford Sadie put away her
traditional slinky gown and be
came Stanford coed June Living
ston last night, as KZSU's sultry
siren went off the air for the
last time this guarter.
"The Sadie role has been an edu
cation in itself." said June, a junior
transfer from Nrw York now living
at Casa Ventura and majoring in
spcech and drama. "When I came
In Stanford in September I was
more the Bostonian type. Now I'd
probably be banned in Boston."
Miss Livingston, a brown - eyed
brunette standing about five feel
two inches tall, has played the part
of Stanford Sadie every Monday
night from 10:30 to 11 on KZSU
since the first autumn quarter
broadcast in October. Until now,
her identity has been kept a secret.
Each quarter a new Sadie is chosen
from the large number of women
auditioning for the part.
The nearest discovery of her
identity came one night when a
group of freshmen crowded into the
KZSU studios in Mrmorial Audi
torium"* June quickly exchanged
places with the radio station's offi
cer on duty, however, and her se
cret was preserved.
"The only other hint that I was
Sadie." said June, "was that I was
conspicuously absent from Ventura
house meetings every Monday
night."
June was selected as Sadie
through n mix-up at KZSU, where

j she had come to try out for radio ,
script writing. Before she knew
what was happening, however, she
found herself before a microphonc
auditioning. After that, the part
! was hers.
"And I had never even heard of
I Sadie at that time.' said June in
| a low. husky voice that left little '
doubt why she hf d been chosen to
read the low. husky lines of Sadie, j
Actually, Miss Livingston contin- |

lied, radio acting was not her prin
cipal interest. Iler chief ambition
lies in writing for radio, television,
movies, and the Broadway musical
stage. At Tufts College, from which
. be transferred to Stanford, she was
vice-president of the United World
Federalists group and co-editor of
I the college paper. Before that she
i wrote award-winning dramatic and
I news scripts lor radio station
| WNYC in New York.


SPILLED THE BEANS lune Livingston has revealed that she is
Stanford morale booster number oneâ€”that is, none other than
Stanford Sadie.
