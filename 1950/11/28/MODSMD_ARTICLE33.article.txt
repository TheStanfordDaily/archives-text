# Scratchin's From the Editor's Pen

The frosh guards apparently were very ef
fective until Thursday and Friday nights when
the blockades were abandoned and Cal raiders
l«lt their marks.
To be sure, the added traffic and Peninsula
spectators at the bonfire and rally necessitated
some relaxing of the guard during the early
hours of the evening, but after midnight there
was no excuse for sparing the manpower.
There was every reason to believe that with
Big Game only one or two days off, the time
would be ripe for a full-sc-ile painting party
from Cal. That's what Stanford got.
Parts of Hoover Library and Memorial Audi
toiium will again have to be sanded, all be
cause of sleepy-eyed, would-be guards.
Regarding college football as a character
building sport, The San Francisco Chronicle
had this to say editorially:
"There is some evidence that the idea is tak
ing hold here and there. We were glad to see
that Stanford elected to renew Marchie
Schwartz's contract'for five years even though
he isn't going to the Rose Bowl this year, and
v/e have heard that the alumni, after some ini
tial shock, were not too hard to reconcile.
"We're not trying to say that what a coach
knows about the T-formation is unimportant;
only that what h*. and can get across
about sportsmanship and citizenship is more
so, and should be so rated in deference to com
mon sense."
Perhaps the idea of football as a game and
not as a factory has not been lost after all.

One of the finest traditions at Stanford—and
cue which is called to the students' attention

when they first read the Frosh Bible—is the
"share a ride" tradition.
That is, by sitting on the bench under the oak
tree across from History Corner or by standing
on the corner of Wilson's in Palo Alto, a stu
dent can reasonably expect a ride offer from
some fellow student driving between the cam
pus and Palo Alto."
Because of the twenty minute wait between
bus runs, a friendly voice saying, "Going into
Paly?" is a welcome greeting.
It's also a subtle and easy way of meeting
new Stanford Sadies.

The problem of catching a ride home for
Christmas vacation is not as easy as a hop into
Palo Alto, but chances are good—thanks to the
Alpha Phi Omega "ride box" at the main li
brary. Students driving back to Chicago or St.
Louis can easily find riders to share the ex
penses by referring to the box.
The service fraternity's program is appre
ciated by car owners and prospective riders
alike, as they plan for the trip home.

All Washington students who will travel to
and from Washington on the train this vacation,
can share in a very worthwhile Christmas pres
ent for the Stanford Crew.
By using their allotted baggage space for the
hauling of two new shells from Seattle, stu
dents can save the crew up to $400 in freight
charges.
A little cooperation now will lessen the bur
den on the overworked crew budget when the
time comes for financing the trip to the national
regatta in the East.

Because of the twenty minute wait between
bus runs, a friendly voice saying, "Going into
Paly?" is a welcome greeting.
It's also a subtle and easy way of meeting
new Stanford Sadies.

The problem of catching a ride home for
Christmas vacation is not as easy as a hop into
Palo Alto, but chances are good—thanks to the
Alpha Phi Omega "ride box" at the main li
brary. Students driving back to Chicago or St.
Louis can easily find riders to share the ex
penses by referring to the box.
The service fraternity's program is appre
ciated by car owners and prospective riders
alike, as they plan for the trip home.

All Washington students who will travel to
and from Washington on the train this vacation,
can share in a very worthwhile Christmas pres
ent for the Stanford Crew.
By using their allotted baggage space for the
hauling of two new shells from Seattle, stu
dents can save the crew up to $400 in freight
charges.
A little cooperation now will lessen the bur
den on the overworked crew budget when the
time comes for financing the trip to the national
regatta in the East.
The frosh guards apparently were very ef
fective until Thursday and Friday nights when
the blockades were abandoned and Cal raiders
l«lt their marks.
To be sure, the added traffic and Peninsula
spectators at the bonfire and rally necessitated
some relaxing of the guard during the early
hours of the evening, but after midnight there
was no excuse for sparing the manpower.
There was every reason to believe that with
Big Game only one or two days off, the time
would be ripe for a full-sc-ile painting party
from Cal. That's what Stanford got.
Parts of Hoover Library and Memorial Audi
toiium will again have to be sanded, all be
cause of sleepy-eyed, would-be guards.
Regarding college football as a character
building sport, The San Francisco Chronicle
had this to say editorially:
"There is some evidence that the idea is tak
ing hold here and there. We were glad to see
that Stanford elected to renew Marchie
Schwartz's contract'for five years even though
he isn't going to the Rose Bowl this year, and
v/e have heard that the alumni, after some ini
tial shock, were not too hard to reconcile.
"We're not trying to say that what a coach
knows about the T-formation is unimportant;
only that what h*. and can get across
about sportsmanship and citizenship is more
so, and should be so rated in deference to com
mon sense."
Perhaps the idea of football as a game and
not as a factory has not been lost after all.

One of the finest traditions at Stanford—and
cue which is called to the students' attention

when they first read the Frosh Bible—is the
"share a ride" tradition.
That is, by sitting on the bench under the oak
tree across from History Corner or by standing
on the corner of Wilson's in Palo Alto, a stu
dent can reasonably expect a ride offer from
some fellow student driving between the cam
pus and Palo Alto."
