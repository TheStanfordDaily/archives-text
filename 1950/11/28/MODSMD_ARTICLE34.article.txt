### VIC PALMIERI 
lIIINGS I'LL NEVER FORGET ABOUT BIG GAME
. . . The way Boh by White hit Cal's safety man,
Ro bison, on our first punt play oi' the game'. . . White
drove him so far into the turf Robison could have
â€¢old himsell to the Boy Scouts as a tent pole.

. . . McColl's unbelievable catch
in the first quarter . . . the way
he went up into the air for that
Lull I figured the refs would search
him for a Jato unit in his pants.
.. . Gordy White, after he'd
dumped two successive Cal plays
lor a loss, standing at the line of
scrimmage grinning from ear to
ear at the two Cal linemen who
were trying to doubleteam him.

. . . IjOs Richter giving one of the great theatrical
performances of the year . . . clutching his wounds
and shouting his anguish after each play, it looked
Hke he was doing the fourth act from King Lear.
. . . Jack Rye making the single greatest defensive
nid play I have ever seen in my life when the Big
'] hree loader around his end on a wide sweep midway
through the second quarter. . . . Rye gave Schabarum
the foot, went under Olszewski, and put the blast on
JVJonachino for a three-yard loss . . . made'em all look
like puttycats, he did.
. . . Marchie "discussing" that disputed call with

referee Cain ... if that was only a discussion I sure
don't ever want to get into an argument with Mr.
Schwartz. I won't say his words were heated, but by
the time he was through Cain's hair had turned pure
white.
. . . Bob Bryan leaping up to shield Marchie from
the photographers during the rhubarb on the field.
The minute the ruckus started every flashbulb on the
lield was popping, but I noticed none of the papers got
a picture of the verbal manslaughter . . . bet they
got enough pictures of Bryan to last them all through
next track season though.
. . . Tommy Shaw, who has been Stanford's best
QB all season but realized it just wasn't his turn Sat
urday, speaking to each player as they went on and
off the field . . . encouraging, praising, lending heart
to our boys who were playing theirs out.
. . . Russ Pomeroy, who spent the afternoon stack
ing up the vaunted Bear offense all over the field,
making his fastest move of the day to capture the game
ball at the final gun.
. . . The way I felt hearing the final hymn. Maybe
some day I'll think it's all kid stuff, the excitement and
the shouting . . . only a game after all. But along
with a lot of other people, I think, I'll never forget
how I ielt during that hymn, and how doggone glad
I was that I went to Stanford.
