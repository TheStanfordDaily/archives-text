## Senior Pictures Urgent 
### 
To the Editor:
I waul to urge all members of the Class of '51 who
hcve not yet done so to take a lew minutes out thus
w-ek to have their pictures taken for Quad.
This if- one ol those things which never seem as im
portant right now as they will in June —when it's too
lute to do anything about them.
B< in» photographed now is desirable not only for
"the record" and for the success ol the yearbook. It is
uUaa good chance to get a negative on file for the iden
tity,'ition pictures we'll need next year as post-grads,
job hunters or travelers.
The Q..ad stair has extended its Senior Class dead
l<u* twicv because of the heavy rain and the activities
ol l.iu week, but they uie still 500 pictures short.
REMEMBER FINAL DEADLINE: THIS
WEDNESDAY. HOURS: 10-12. 1-5. PLACE: QUAD
SoACK.
