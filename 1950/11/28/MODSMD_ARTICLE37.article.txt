# Raise Ticket Prices
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In the old days, alumni could expect to get a pair
of tickets to the Big Game, and students could get two
tickets in addition to their rooters' tickets.
Before the war, the Buck of the Month Club was a
small organization, but now it has expanded, and I
understand that over a thousand of its members never
even went to Stanford. I understand that the Buck
of the Month Club gets priority over paid-up alumni
on about six thousand tickets.
The price of tickets (before the tax) is the same five
dollars that it has been for a long time. The price of
most everything else has about doubled since the
'thirties.
We have just had a demonstration that demand far
outruns supply. Our coaches of other sports are
greatly underpaid. Our physical athletic facilities are
lar from adequate, so why not increase the price of
Big fÂ»ame tickets to ten dollars and increase Buck ol
the Month dues to $25 per one ticket preference.
Also it .seems as though Calilornia gets a bigger
ticket allotment than Stanford, but that the gate is
split even. So, il ticket prices are raised, Californians,
will "de facto," be conti ibuting to Stanford.
In summary, w< need athletic revenues and seem
committed lo a policy of commercialism; let us obtain
a good price lor our virtue.
