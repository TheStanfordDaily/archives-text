# IPR CONFERENCE
## North, Fisher Give Impressions of Asia 
### CORNELIA LITTLE 
"The general impression I got
in my trip through the Far East
was one of a seething of discon
tent."
Thus Robert fto'rth, Hoover Li
brary research assistant, summed
up his tour of crucial points in
southern and eastern Asia follow
ing the annual October conference
of the Institute of Pacific Relations.
North, who represented Stanford
and the IPR at the conference,
heard shooting and bombing only a
few miles away in Burma and Sin
gapore, and even in points such as
Thailand and Manila where the
governments are relatively secure,
saw the unrest which has been
brought on by economic disequi
librium ant! rising nationalism.
Anti-French Rebellion
In French Indo-China, where the
fighting is most serious, North found
long-run forces working against
Communism in spite of the fact that
now the Reds are much stronger.
The rebellion, he reports, is anti-
French and nationalist rather than
Communist in character. The Chi
nese Communists are making the
most of this nationalist feeling, but
their interference is resented by the
Indo - Chinese, who like neither
Communism nor the Chinese, who
they suspect, with some justifica
tion, have imperialist designs on
Indo-China.
Many Indo-Chinese feel, reports
North, that the problem might be
solved by the French "publishing a
schedule of independence" — grant
ing independence not immediately
but step by step.
The Chinese are also a problem in
Singapore, where they are few but
well organized, and, while they are
not actually Communist, they have
a new-found pride in the strength
of their homeland under Red rule.
Though Thailand and Burma* are
poor like the other nations of
Southeast Asia, it is said there that
"their poverty is opulent"—at least
by comparison. But even there
there is unrest and even fighting,
North said.
Attended Conference
Dr. Harold Fisher, another mem
ber of the Hoover Library group,
found a contrast in the Middle East
where there is as much poverty and
despair but "much less ferment."
There in particular there is a great
problem with displaced persons,
particularly relugees to and from
Israel.
Fisher attended the IPH confer
ence in Lucknow as a representa
tive of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. He was chair
man of the American delegation
there, and described some of his im
pressions of the conference for The
Daily along with North.
Dr. Tisher described one of the
main values of the conference as
ence. To India, where the press is
being one of education and influ
government - controlled, the other
delegations brought different points
of view, and their discussions were
reported in the press.
India Suspicious
The Americans found the Indians
unable to understand why the U.S.
"blocked" Red China in the UN, for
example. India is more suspicious
of Western imperialism than of

Russian Communism, and "by their
own experience, not because of
propaganda," Fisher explains.
He added that the Americans
found it necessary to explain "the
Knowland point of view" at the
conference in order to show the In
dians that the present U.S. Far
Eastern policy could be, from In
dia's point of view, worse.
Dr. Fisher emphasized that, like
most of the other nations of south
eastern Asia, India is not pro-Com
munist, though it has its small
groups of well-organized Reds.
One last point about Asia made
by Dr. Fisher was the critical
shortage of skillet! people, of libra
ries and laboratories, and of initia
tive. At the same time, due to a
static social and industrial system,
skilled college graduates can't get
jobs—a tragic paradox.
"The old system has been upset,"
he explains, "and the new one has
not yet developed." He adds that
this is one of the many problems of
the Far East that the United States
must try to solve.
