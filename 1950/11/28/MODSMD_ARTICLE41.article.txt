## Stanford's Gardeners Have Their Troubles, Too 
### PAULINE KUNZ 
Where the rolling foothills rise is the scene ol Dirk Schroder's
all-year battle against beetles, caterpillars, mildew, weeds—and
students.
The stocky Dutchman with brown hair and blue eyes is Stan
ford's head gardener. He admits that students do not pick flowers.

But he deplores the propensity of
hungry or absent-minded ones
| pick leaves and twigs from bushes.
The odd-shaped boxwood bushes
j along Lasuen Street in front of the
Union are some of the obvious re
sults of the students' befuddled
fondness for greenery. Many of the
campus lawns have to be continu
ally reseeded because the students
perennially would rather walk on
i the soft green lawns than on the
well - worn, conventional trails
called sidewalks.
Water Supply
Students may annually worry
over the water in Lake Lagunita,
; but to Schroder the long dry sea
i son ol the Santa Clara Valley makes
j watefr a year - round problem.
Plants, trees, and shrubs are care
: fully selected and irrigation con
trolled to stretch the inadequate
supply of water.
Twenty men work full time to
care for the grass, lawns, shrubs,
and flowers on the 1,500 acres of the
campus proper. One gardener can
| cut all the campus lawns in three
days, but it takes three months fqr
one worker to clip all the campus
J hedges, even with the aid of elec
tric trimmers.
'Obsolete' Insecticides
A never-ceasing battle is waged
i on the Farm to control the killers
of plant life. "DDT" is used for a
j lew trees, but host trees are sprayed
I with effective insecticides. Schro
der linds that "DDT - ' has lost its
effectiveness because many insects
become immune to the poison after
six generations. In fact, most in
i secticides are "obsolete" after three
' years because more effective ones
are constantly being developed.
Once a year the "Fijis" help the
! regular staff of gardeners by clip—
; ping the dead fronds of the palm
I trees, which they use as decora
j tions for their annual "South Seas"
j party.
Campus Flowers
Flowers for the campus are
grown in a nursery behind the Mu
seum. They are selected by the

never - varying formula: Which
flowers can be grown with the least
amount of care?
The beds of petunias and pansies
are a familiar sight to the stu
dents congregating on the steps of
the History corner. The nursery
sells surplus plants to campus resi
dents and University employees at
cost. As a holiday service, the nur
sery sells Christmas wreaths and
trees to the dormitories.
