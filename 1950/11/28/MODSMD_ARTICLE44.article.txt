SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 28 (UP)
—For the first time in history, three
sophomores made the United Press
1950 All - Pacific Coast Conference
football team announced today.
The club, selected" with the aid of
West Coast sports writers, had on it
three men each from California and
Washington, two each from UCLA
and Stanford, and one from South
ern California.
The sophomores named to the
squad are center Don Moomaw,
UCLA; guard Ted Holzknecht,
Washington; and fullback Johnny
Olszewski of California.
However, the standouts in the
balloting were big end Bill McColl
of Stanford, a junior, who was
named on every ballot; Les Hichter,
California's fine linebacker guard;
and Don Heinrich, Washington
quarterback, who was named on
every ballot except one.
Completing the backfield were
Hugh McElhenny, Washington, who
barely edged out California's Pete
Schabarum, and Jim Monachino, the
third member of the Bears' "Ter
rible Trio." \
Bob Wilkinson, UCLA's fine pass
catching end, was an easy second in
the balloting for a wing-post; while
Russ Pomeroy, Stanford, was a run
away victor in the balloting for
tackles. The second tackle spot
went to Volney Peters of USC, who
edged out Breck Stroschein of
UCLA..
The club is made up of three
sophomores, four juniors, and four
seniors.
On the second team, surprisingly
enough, there are 10 seniors. A
sophomore, Sam Baker, Oregon

State fullback, filled in the other
spot. Paul McMurtry, veteran USC
guard, was the oldest man on either
squad, being listed as 31. Moomaw,
at 18, was the youngest.
