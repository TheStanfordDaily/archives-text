# Firehouse, Phi Kaps, Dekes, And SAE Rout Gridiron Foes
## 
### 
Yesterday's mural football play
offs saw the strong slaughter the
week in four badly-matched games.
Firehouse rolled over El Captian,
38 to 0; Deke I beat Beta 11, 31 to
0; SAE I slaughtered Village 306,
33 to 0; and Phi Kap I mauled Lee's
Marauders, 28 to C.
In the Firehouse-El Capitan rout,
it was the smoke-eaters all the way
throughout the first half. The Fire
house scored the first time it laid
hands on the pigskin, with tailback
Monty Pfyl running over for the
initial score.
Despite the rough playing of the

smoke-eaters, Capitan held them to
one tally in the last half.
It was the Dekes all the way as
the pin - point passing of Merritt
Van Sant brought home a 31 to 0
victory over the Beta ll's. Besides
running over six points, Van Sant
passed to Jack Heinen for two
scores, to Charlie Brazil for another
TD, and to Hut Taylor for the last
one.
Phi Kap's sparkling quarterback
Lloyd Kelly passed to Dave Kur
bach, Tom Randolph, and Ed Askey
for Phi Kap points. Randolph ran
over one TD late in the game. Lee's
Marauders came to life and chalked
up a TD on a pass from Dick Long
to Grant Duncan.
The highly rated SAE squad
moved closer to the finals as Frank
Casella passed them to a 33 to 0
win over Village 30G. Scoring passes
were completed to Jim Britt, Dar
rell Kreitz, and Jack Favors.
