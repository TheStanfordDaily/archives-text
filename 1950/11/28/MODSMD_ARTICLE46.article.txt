## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 27 (UP)â€”Two
of the nation's great powerhouse
football teams, California and Mich
igan, were voted into the Rose Bowl
today and will meet in the Pasadena
classic on Jan. 1 in the fifth renewal
of the Big Ten-Pacific Coast Con
i ference clash.
While the Bears and the Wolver
ines won their conference crowns
in Saturday's clashes, it wasn't until
today that members of the loop
made the Rose Bowl bids official by
secret ballot.
It was the third straight trip to
the New Year's Day game for Coach
Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf and his
boys, and it was the second time
I in four years for the Wolverines.
