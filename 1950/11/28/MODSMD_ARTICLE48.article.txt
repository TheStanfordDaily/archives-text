# Four Past Card Gridders in Pro Ball; '49er Albert Leads Play for Pay Boys
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Only four former Stanford Big
Game players remain in the ranks of
professional football. All four of
these men were in the starting line
up when Stanford's last undefeated
team defeated Nebraska, 21 to 13, in
the Rose Bowl, Jan. 1, 1941.
Frankie Albert, quarterback of the
1940 "Wow Boys," heads the list of
Farm notables in the play-for-pay
game. Albert returned from the
Navy in 1946 to join the San Fran-

Cisco '49ers, the Bay city's first entry
in Major League football.
Now in his fifth season of calling
signals for the '49ers, the little T
wizard is still going strong.
Albert's biggest year was 1948
when the '49ers were edged out in a
nip-and-tuck race for All-America
Conference crown by the mighty
Cleveland Browns. That season he
surpassed Sid Luckman's all-time
major league mark of 27 touchdown
passes in a season by throwing for 29
6-pointers.
Two more of Albert's Stanford
teammates, Norm Standlee and
Bruno Banducci, are still with him
on the '49er squad. Standlee moved
right into the starting berth at full
back for the National League power
house, the Chicago Bears, upon his
graduation from the Farm in '41.
The "Big Chief" burned up the
league his first year, but was called
away to war before another season
rolled around. After the war he re
turned to join the '49ers in 1946.
Banducci, another charter member
of the '49ers, was a sensation his first
two years out, being tagged "Mr.
Guard" by sports scribes throughout
the league. However, a shoulder in
jury has slowed him down consider
ably, in the past few years, and he is

used mostly in relief roles now.
Vic Lindskog is the only other
Stanford grad still playing for the I
pros. Lindskog is the pivot man in
the Philadelphia Eagles' strong line.j
He spends some of his time helping
the new talent learn the ropes of the ;
pro game, and is on the payroll as a
player-coach.
Four other members of the "Wow i
Boys" eleven spent time in the pro
fessional ranks. Halfback Hugh Gal
lerneau went with Standlee to the '
Chicago Boars, who used the same
type of T-formation that Clark
Shaugnessy introduced at Stanford.
Gallarneau quickly moved into the
front line attack. After the war he i
returned to an administrative post
with the Bears.
The fourth member of Stanford's
1940 backfield, Pete Kmetovic, played
with the Detroit Lions until he took
up coaching. He returned to the 1
Farm this year in the capacity of
backfield coach.
Chuck Taylor played a year of
guard for the Miami Seahawks in
1946, before returning to coach the
Stanford frosh to undefeated sea
sons in 1947, '48, and '49. This year :
the '49ers grabbed him for their line !
coach.
