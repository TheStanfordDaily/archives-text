# Czech Flights Barred
## 
### 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia â€” The
United States banned some Czecho
slovak air line flights over the
American zone of Germany today
and restricted others as a reprisal
for "disgraceful' violation of air
regulations.
The stern action was taken on the
ground that Czechoslovak planes
deliberately violated air regulations
by flying delegates to a Communist
sponsored "peace congress" from
England to Warsaw, Poland, over
the American occupation zone
without notification.
