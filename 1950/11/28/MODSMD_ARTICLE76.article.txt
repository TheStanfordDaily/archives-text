# THE
						DU PONT DIGEST
## The
						Teflon* Problem: Given a plastic for which there is no known solvent, how would you turn it into a coating? 
### 
Some time ago Du Pont research dis
covered a new plastic—"Teflon" tet
rafluoroethylene resin. It had tem
perature resistance beyond the range
ofany previous plastic, excellent elec
trical characteristics, and the highest
degree of chemical inertness among
commercial plastics.
Hut tough-guy "Teflon" was
almost too tough. It wouldn't melt
and (low like other plastics. Hence,
it could be molded only in simple
shapes. There was no existing tech
nique by which it could be made into
thin coatings. Unless this difficulty
could be overcome, the very proper
ties that made "Teflon" so promis
ing narrowed its usefulness.
"Teflon" Won't Dissolve
In the past, problems like this have
been handled by dissolving plastics
in a suitable solvent and using them
as the base for enamels and similar
coatings. But "Teflon" will not dis
solve in any solvent yet known. It
even stands up to nitric acid.
At this point Du Pont physical
chemists suggested dispersions
minute particles suspended in a liq
uid —as the answer. After much
study, scientists of the Polychcmicals
Department learned how to suspend
"Teflon" particles about 1/125,000
of an inch in diameter. Aided by the
fundamental studies of Chemical
Department scientists, they devised
today's commercial scale process.

Meanwhile Du Pont'a Fabrics and
Finishes Department, was keeping
pace with the development. Their
contributions to formulating the new
products did much to establish "Tef
lon" polytctrafluoroethylcnc coat
ings and wire enamels in many
special uses.
In electric motors, for instance,
these enamels are used on wire so
the motor can be operated at higher
temperatures and will deliver more
power per unitof weight.Such motors
are more compact and sometimes
cost less.
Other uses include non-sticking
coatings that cut costs when applied
to bakery rolls, rubber molds, heat
sealing machinery and similar equip
ment. Corrosion-resistant "Teflon"
coatings for special uses are currently
being investigated.
Product of Teamwork
"Teflon" finishes are a typical fruit
of the close teamwork of Du Pont
technical rnen ofd i verse back grounds.
Organic and physical chemists played
a major role. Physicists participated
by developing fundamental informa
tion on the nature of the dispersion.
Chemical and mechanical engineers
designed the manufacturing appara
tus. Working together,they made pos
sible this new and important addi
tion to the Du Pont family of "Better
Things for Better Living ... through
Chemistry." •n««. n. s. iwnt onr.
