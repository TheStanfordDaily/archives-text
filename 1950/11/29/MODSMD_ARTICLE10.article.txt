# Sex Offense Laws Failing, Doctor Says
## 
### 
"Present - day social legislation
for sexual offenders is not achiev
ing its purpose; it is instead ob
scuring the real elements of the
problem,' declared Dr. Manfred
Guttmacher, Baltimore psychiatrist,
last night.
Addressing a â€¢ Tuesday Evening
Series audience of 1,000 in Mem
Aud, Dr. Guttmacher discussed
"The Sexual Offender" us one of the
Jacob Gitnbcl Lectures on Sex Psy
chology.
The psychiatrist, chief medical of
ficer for the Supreme Bench of
Baltimore, revealed that in studies
of criminals convicted of rape, it
was discovered that none were pre
vious sexual offenders, and burg
lary was related more to the vio
lent sex crime than minor sex mis
demeanors.
"Further studies have pointed
nut." said Dr. Guttmacher, "that the
sexual psychopath laws designed to
put minor sexual offenders in insti
tutions arc not hastening us to our
goal."
"In order to work toward a .solu
tion of this problem." urged the
medical-legal expert, "wo, must be
tolerant toward sex offenders while
not necessarily condoning the of
fenses."
He recommended the establish
ment of more court clinics like
those now existing in Baltimore and
five other major cities in the United
States. Such clinics give psychiatric,
psychological, and social examina
tions, and, acting as neutral agents,
advise the sentencing judge about
the man with whom he's dealing.
"In working toward a solution,"
Dr. Guttmachcr concluded, "the
problem of sexual offenders and of
fenses should be studied in univer
sities, not in legislatures, with the
pooling of sociologists, anthropolo
gists, psychologists, psychiatrists,
and lawyers."
