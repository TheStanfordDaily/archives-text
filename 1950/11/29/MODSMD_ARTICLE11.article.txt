Fifth Visit to U.S.
Green, an Anglican rector of Bir- I
mingham, England, is in the United
States for the fifth time "to help |
people become Christians."
He has said of Protestantism in
the United States: "'lt's no good hav- i
ing a nut that is ail shell and no j
kernel. ... In America you have a i
vague liberal kind of Protestantism j
which jettisons the Christ of the j
Gospels . . . you put the Church 1
before Jesus; you put. the body be
fore the head. . . . You will never
make people Christians until you
confront them with Christ."
Spiritual Basis
Green has previously preached in
Canada and the Midwestern United j
States as well as in New York. He
has also spoken to our occupation j
troops in Germany.
This week in San Francisco, ex- |
plaining one of the aims of his mis
sion, Green said, "Most sensible
people ... see ... a crisis in world I
history. The real issue of that crisis '
is the need to get the world back
on a spiritual basis.
"Thoughtful people realize thai j
you can t beat. Communism with j
armed forces. You need faith, sound !
Christian faith. We have not the i
least chance of keeping Communism 1
out. of any country now unless that j
country has real loyalty. Such loy- i
ally can only be engendered if that '
nation has a good Christian spirit."
