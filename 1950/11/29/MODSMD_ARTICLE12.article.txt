# World Union Is Necessary, Joyce Warns
## 
### 
"Either wc construct a world
government or there is no hope and
we must suffer the consccjiiences,"
James Avery Joyce warned yester
day at the Women's Clubhouse in a
talk spor ored by the Stanford Stu
dent Federalists.
"This government must not be
a status quo. It must be dynamic
and take into account problems as
soon as they arise," he declared.
He referred to a conference of
psychologists and psychiatrists who
generally agreed that we must have
a world government if only for the
mental health of mankind. "The
atomic bomb and other scientific
mctho s of warfare have placed a
heavy weight over our heads."
Joyce's opinion of foreign policy
in general is that nations today are
too much centered on their own in
ternal regimes and thus make a
foreign policy subsidiary to their
domestic problems.
"States .h their own way have
brought an end to war, but their
biggest problem is to win the
peace." w;>s his feeling toward the
problem of war.
Joyce also mentioned a pro
posed World Constituent Assem
bly in New Delhi laic in 1051.
"'I his may he the starling point
of world government," he de
clared.
