# QUIET AT CROTHERS? NOT WITH TRUCKS, COMPRESSORS, AIR HAMMERS
## Crothers' Wings Sprout Amid Ear-Splitting Bedlam 
### 
Pandemonium has broken out
around usually quiet Crothers Hall,
the Stanford graduate law dorm.
The reccnt gift by Judge George E.
Crothers of funds for two new
wings has brought, air hammers,
compressors, and other ear-splitting
equipment to work at both ends of
the building.
All day lone both ends of the
building arc in a constant bedlam,
while the center is a little quieter.
Noise is so great in the end rooms
j that it is necessary to shout or even
to touch a person to get his atten
tion.
Most of the students with end
rooms have given up trying to study
in their rooms and have retreated
to the law libe. A Jew valiant . ouls
in the middle are trying to study
but admit: "It's plenty rough."
The greatest offenders to study
are the air hammers which are be
ing used to knock ofT the balconies
at the ends of the buildings. Hopes
are running high that when this is
finished there may be a little peace.
However, some of the neccssary
evil will probably go on, since the
building will not be finished until
the end of the school year.- Mark

MORE UNIVERSITY BUILDING Students watch as workmen begin laying the foundations for
Crothers Hall's two new $348,000 wings that were donated by Judge George E. Crothers this
summer. More than a few roughs from nearby living groups have been heard to complain of
the noise coincident with the building project. â€”Daily photo by Tom Peterson
