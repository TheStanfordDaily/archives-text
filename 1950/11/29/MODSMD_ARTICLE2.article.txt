LONDON' — A well-informed
source said today that Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur, aware of the danger
that the Chinese Communists might
throw their full weight into the Ko
rean war, asked permission more
than six weeks ago to bomb Rod
war bases in Manchuria.
The British government objected
to thr proposal in the strongest
lerms, the informant said, and ap
parently it was shelved.
However, the informant said, the
present almost desperate situation
in Korea made it seem almost cer
tain that Mac Arthur would make a
second request—and an authorita
tive source said that if he did so
the British government again would
oppose it adamantly.
