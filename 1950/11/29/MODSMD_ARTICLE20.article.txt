# Employees Here May Get Social Security Benefits
## 
### 
1 or the first time in Stanford s history—thanks to a congres- !
sional amendment passed last August in Washington—every Uni
versity employee may soon become eligible for national Social j
Security benefits.
At their regular meeting last week, the Board of Trustees offi- j

waived Stanford's tax exempt
• status in order to include the Univer- j
i sity in the new setup, which makes
I non-profit educational institutions
eligible for Social Security. Accep- j
I lance is now contingent upon a two
thirds vote of Farm employees.
Assistant to the President Thomas
Spragens said last night that vot
ing sheets will probably go out to
employees sometime early next
week. Along with them, he stated,
would go University-prepared
booklets explaining the benefits
that accrue from membership in
the Social Security program.
At present, many Stanford em- j
ployees — both acadcmic and non
academic—are participating in pri- j
vato old age insurance programs. If I
the new proposal passes, Spragens j
j said, non-faculty employees would j
i pay a total of one per cent less than j
they now pay under their present in
surance program—and still receive j
benefits both from the private plan
: and the government. Total benefits
would go up, he stated.
Faculty employees, on the other
hand, who arc now covered by the !
TIAA (Teachers' Insurance and An
nuity Association), will pay the same
J as before—in so far as the insurance \
i company will lower its premiums by
• an amount corresponding to the social
security tax (now one and one-half
, per cent).
"Students who work for the Uni
versity." Spragens said, "are not
eligible under the program and
consequently will not have to pay
Social Security taxes."
Should two-thirds of the employees
desire Social Security and the re
mainder oppo.se it, Spragens com
j mentcd, the latter will not be re- i
| quired to join.
