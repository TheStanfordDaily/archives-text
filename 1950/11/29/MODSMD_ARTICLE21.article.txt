# Red Chinese Troops Attacking in 'New War'
## UN 						Everywhere on Defense as Commies Near Link-up With Powerful Guerrilla Forces Operating in Rear 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Nov. 29 (UP)—Chinese Communist hordes cut down the Allied Chongchon
River bridgehead to a precarious 30-mile length today as they hit the crumbling UN front with
wave after wave of fanatic troops.
The savage assault showed no indication of a letup as the Chinese ignored fantastic losses.
They overran several important towns and road junctions.
As Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur charged that the Chinese had created an "entirely new war,"

mounted Chinese cavalrymen
pouring through a breach in the
lines neared a linkup with a
; powerful guerrilla force in the rear of
the U.S. Bth Army.
Miles From Pyongyang
Field reports indicated that the
, Chinese already had penetrated
j southward to within 30 miles of the
! foimor North Korean capital of
i Pyongyang to join up with guerrillas
| in the Songchon area.
United Press correspondent Joe
Quinn reported from Bth Army head
i quarters that the American, South
Korean, British, and Turkish troops
battling to save the? stricken right
flank of the UN Army in Korea were
; "shooting until their guns are too hot
to hold, hut the Reds roll in like the
oceansidc surf."
"Human Sea" Tactics
The "human sea" tactics of the
Communists, gorv warfare common
! to the Chinese civil war, saw the rnr
i my charging in wave after wave, re
gardless of losses, until the objective
was overwhelmed by sheer weipht of
! numbers.
Such a surf of frenzied Communists
i was reported streaming southward
I through the hole knocked in the
1 middle of the Allied lino by the first
| impact of the Chinese offensive,
i The Chinese had smashed through
, the Allied' line within less than 20
miles of an estimated two to three
divisions of guerrillas assembled
i ome 40 miles above Pyongyang.
J A linkup would enable the Com
munists to strike westward in a bid to
I slash to the sea and bottle up the
! whole Allied army fin the northwest
ern front. Already some units had
turned to the west to feel out the
; defenses behind the Bth Army front.


REDS COUNTER-ATTACK—Reds counter-attacked savagely
(shaded arrow), ripped 8 to 12 miles through gap eight miles
wide in Allied line near Tokchon. U.S. Marines were ordered
to strike west (broken arrow) against flank of attacking Reds
from west bank of Chosin Reservoir (2). Marines, trying to
establish east-west line across Korea, attempt to stop enemy
from linking with guerrillas near Sokchon (3), thus establishing
north-south line. In northwest, unopposed Yanks halted to pro
tect flanks after advancing past Congju (4). On west coast,
Gl's met little opposition as they drove north of Chongjin to
point 50 miles from border. —Acme Telephoto
