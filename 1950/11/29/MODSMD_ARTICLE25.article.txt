Ah -you lucky, lucky people—once again we.em
bark upo:. tiie of the thrilling real-life adventures of
A 1 Hi-ny L'oy Prince Valiant.
We had our Big Game party ai the Lo- Murales Inn
in Carmtl. It would have been a ve»; ' n : i« aUuir .n-

cept for the fact that someone —as
yet unidentified— brought a bottle
of some kind of fiery liquid. Hav
ing been to only four Big Game
parties, 1 was as yet unacquainted
with the terrible stuff, and I think
1 should relate at this time, the
dangers involved if ever you
should allow the putrified grape
squeezings to touch the purity of

your lips.
Soon after arriving at the Inn, someone handed
me the brown-glass bottle, and being naturally
curious I allowed myself—in a lit of exultation over
the game—to take a sip. It burned; my eyes watered.
1 gasped. "What is it?" 1 asked timidly.
"It's Scotch, yu jerk," one of the more lovable broth
ers replied. "Have another snort."
"A snort?" I questioned. "What is that!" I was shown
very graphically the meaning of the uncouth term,
and was soon—after great and heroic resistance on my
part was persuaded to let a few more drops of this
strange and unfamiliar liquid trickle down my in
flamed throat. Soon—l blush with shame —I was im
bibing more and more of the nectar of the Devil, and
to my horror I observed that the Queen was likewise
tasting of the yellow liquid known as "Scotch."
Soon 1 began to feel a slight tingling feeling spread
ing" o"er the ample bulk of my manly form. The tingle
scon went away leaving nothing but a dull numb feel
in;; in all parts of my body. Strange to report, the feel
ing was not as unpleasant as I had expected. 1 was
feeling somewhat gay. I laughed. Ha! And was even
/Moved to kiss a young gurl—who had been drinking,
1 m told upon the front tooth. Now I was even gayer,
a master among men. 1 roared like a lion and chased

imaginary rabbits, cleverly disguised as Super-Cal,
around the room.
Now I was in the plush lounge of the Inn. I knew
I was having hallucinations because I saw pretty
girls leaping like a painting of Spring (more amply
clothed, however) around the room. Another was
standing on the top ol a coffee table doing ballet
steps. With this, I remembered what my father
vividly described to me about the DTs.
"Oh no!" I cried, "This could not be happening to
me." With that I dashed over to a group of the broth
ers, who were obviously in the same repentant mood
that I was in, for they were singing an old Negro spir
itual. I joined in: "There was a friar of great re
nown. . . "
When the beating of my tiny heart had slowed some
what, 1 returned to the lounge, only to meet with the
same strange sight—the gil ls, the dancing, the laugh
ter. Naturally I was shocked, but was relieved to per
ceive that the dancing was actually going on.
"What has the world come to?" I wept. I groped
blindly for a glass of water to quell the trembling in my
throat. Somehow I must have grabbed at the wrong
glass, for once more the fiery liquid, known as
"Scotch," poured down my surprised palate.
After that the party seemed to be even gayer, and
I slowly accustomed myself to the bizarre actions of
my companions. It actually seemed all right to drink
and smoke and dance and laugh. I stayed up with the
party and slowly became one of them. The liquid
known as "Scotch" had completely stifled my will
to resist.
So, there it is. 'My confession. I hope now that it is
presented to you, you will take measures to prevent
your falling into the evil ways that I have. As 1 write
this there is a sharp razor near my elbow, and as soon
as the last word is written I will dispatch myself from
this world. I can't go on with the knowledge that I
have "drank" hanging over me. Save yourself, sin
ners, before it is too late.

I was having hallucinations because I saw pretty
girls leaping like a painting of Spring (more amply
clothed, however) around the room. Another was
standing on the top ol a coffee table doing ballet
steps. With this, I remembered what my father
vividly described to me about the DTs.
"Oh no!" I cried, "This could not be happening to
me." With that I dashed over to a group of the broth
ers, who were obviously in the same repentant mood
that I was in, for they were singing an old Negro spir
itual. I joined in: "There was a friar of great re
nown. . . "
When the beating of my tiny heart had slowed some
what, 1 returned to the lounge, only to meet with the
same strange sight—the gil ls, the dancing, the laugh
ter. Naturally I was shocked, but was relieved to per
ceive that the dancing was actually going on.
"What has the world come to?" I wept. I groped
blindly for a glass of water to quell the trembling in my
throat. Somehow I must have grabbed at the wrong
glass, for once more the fiery liquid, known as
"Scotch," poured down my surprised palate.
After that the party seemed to be even gayer, and
I slowly accustomed myself to the bizarre actions of
my companions. It actually seemed all right to drink
and smoke and dance and laugh. I stayed up with the
party and slowly became one of them. The liquid
known as "Scotch" had completely stifled my will
to resist.
So, there it is. 'My confession. I hope now that it is
presented to you, you will take measures to prevent
your falling into the evil ways that I have. As 1 write
this there is a sharp razor near my elbow, and as soon
as the last word is written I will dispatch myself from
this world. I can't go on with the knowledge that I
have "drank" hanging over me. Save yourself, sin
ners, before it is too late.

Ah -you lucky, lucky people—once again we.em
bark upo:. tiie of the thrilling real-life adventures of
A 1 Hi-ny L'oy Prince Valiant.
We had our Big Game party ai the Lo- Murales Inn
in Carmtl. It would have been a ve»; ' n : i« aUuir .n-

cept for the fact that someone —as
yet unidentified— brought a bottle
of some kind of fiery liquid. Hav
ing been to only four Big Game
parties, 1 was as yet unacquainted
with the terrible stuff, and I think
1 should relate at this time, the
dangers involved if ever you
should allow the putrified grape
squeezings to touch the purity of

your lips.
Soon after arriving at the Inn, someone handed
me the brown-glass bottle, and being naturally
curious I allowed myself—in a lit of exultation over
the game—to take a sip. It burned; my eyes watered.
1 gasped. "What is it?" 1 asked timidly.
"It's Scotch, yu jerk," one of the more lovable broth
ers replied. "Have another snort."
"A snort?" I questioned. "What is that!" I was shown
very graphically the meaning of the uncouth term,
and was soon—after great and heroic resistance on my
part was persuaded to let a few more drops of this
strange and unfamiliar liquid trickle down my in
flamed throat. Soon—l blush with shame —I was im
bibing more and more of the nectar of the Devil, and
to my horror I observed that the Queen was likewise
tasting of the yellow liquid known as "Scotch."
Soon 1 began to feel a slight tingling feeling spread
ing" o"er the ample bulk of my manly form. The tingle
scon went away leaving nothing but a dull numb feel
in;; in all parts of my body. Strange to report, the feel
ing was not as unpleasant as I had expected. 1 was
feeling somewhat gay. I laughed. Ha! And was even
/Moved to kiss a young gurl—who had been drinking,
1 m told upon the front tooth. Now I was even gayer,
a master among men. 1 roared like a lion and chased

imaginary rabbits, cleverly disguised as Super-Cal,
around the room.
Now I was in the plush lounge of the Inn. I knew
I was having hallucinations because I saw pretty
girls leaping like a painting of Spring (more amply
clothed, however) around the room. Another was
