# CAMPUS OPINION
## Socialized Health Service 
### 
To the Editor:
1 he American people have lately become conscious
i-i the dire threat presented by communism abroad, but
""trv/ hirvp'T .me to realize the graver menace presented
Ly comtnunhm and socialism at home. . . .
On this campus, we have, hiding under the thin dis
guise of the Stanford Public Health Sei vice, a social
i:,tic outfit.
1 he so-called Public Health Service is supported by
equal contributions from every student regardless of
race, color, creed, or status be they black or white,
Catholic, Protestant, or Christian Scientist. The con

scientious objections of students of contrary religious
beliefs is entirely ignored. Those who never use the
services of this socialized medicine outfit are not ex
empt from payment.
On the other hand, students who have had occasion
to use the service have found that individual attention
received is a minimum. They have also observed the
excessive red-tape attendant on their visit, diagnosis,
and treatment.
It we are to be consistent in our opposition to com
munism. we should insist upon immediate discontinu
ance of socialized medicine on the Stanford campus.
