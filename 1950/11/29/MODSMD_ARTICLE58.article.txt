# Cagers Crab Spotlight; Season Opens December 1
## 'Fastest Fast Breaks Since the War' To Start Against the Stanford Alumni 
### EARL ODELL 
Styles will change this Friday night and the campus spotlight
will switch from padded shoulders to short pants as the put-the
ball-through-the-hoop boys take to the court against the Stanford
alumni in the Pavilion.
Another switch will occur when Coach Everett Dean finds

I George Yurdley, the Cards' contri
[ bution to All-American honors last
I year, playing, not tor him, but
j against him.
Opening a 26 - game schedule,
headman Dean announces that he
will pull out of his bag of tricks the
j fastest break since before the war,
but will be faced with the same
problem Marchie Schwartz had —
lack of depth. However, Dean will
! know more of that when the team
[ returns from its Eastern campaign
after facing the likes of NYU at
New York and Pennsylvania (inci
dentally, coached by Howie Dallmar,
a Stanford great of yesteryear) at
Philadelphia.
Npw Addition to Lineup
The most promising addition to
the Card lineup, aside from the re
| turn of the stalwarts of last year,
j is forward Ed Tucker, junior trans
fer from Compton JC. While at
! Compton, Eddie managed to grab
junior college All-American honors
and received the most valuable
player award in a Southern Cali
fornia tournament. "Tucker will be
a fine addition to the Stanford
squad," said Dean. "He has lots of
speed, cleverness, a good eye, and
has fine competitive spirit."
Besides Tucker, the court will be
filled with Jim Ramstead, 6-ft. 5-in.
center, who has come into his own
this year after playing stand-in for
Yardley last year much of the time;
Jack O'Sullivan, a fighting Irishman
if there ever was one, playing lot
ward; Jim Walsh and Bruce Iver
son, guards, who measure 6 ft. 3 in.
and 6 ft. 2 in. respectively without
the use of sox; and Harry Huga
siiih. a guard and holdover from the
football season. Harry feels equally
at home on boards and grass.
Before the season is finished more
names will appear, but for the pres
it it looks like these six take the
lead\
Early Attendance Urged
Don Liebendorfer, Athletic News
Director, urges that those who plan
|to attend the first three games,
j Stanford Alumni, Santa Clara, and
[ San Jose State, come early and
avoid the possibility of being turned
j away. Last year trouble of this sort
j resulted when large numbers of
| rooters from both Santa Clara and
i San Jose State showed up.
Since both the Broncos and the
j Spartans are regarded by many as
the top independents on the Coast
this year, a large turnout is ex
| pected.
