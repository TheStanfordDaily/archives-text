# Pappy at the Bat
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
It looked extremely rocky for the Berkeley squad that day;
The score stood 0 to 0. with but one half to play.
All day long the fearsome Bear had acted very tame,
A fact which wreathed the features of Cal patrons of the game.
"But, wait, wait!!!" shouted Pappy, his voice extremely hoarse.
"Somehow, somewhere, there must be a mistakeâ€”of course!!
"Obviously there can be no confiiction.-
"It's us by two touchdowns in Leiser's prediction."
So when Bryan took the kickolT to the Stanford twenty-four.
The Cal rooting section cried, "For the Indians, no more!''
The plea came true as the Red Indian fumbled,
And Pete Schabarum for the Stanford goal rtimldcd.
When Richter kicked the extra point out of Lee's hand,
The Bear backs shouted, "Hey, we're the best in the land.
"We've won every game in four years.
"A big six, locomotive, and fifteen cheers."
But Stanford came roaring back as Gary spotted White,
And let the ball whiz away in its long trajectory (light.
Bobby easily took the ball for a Stanford score,
And Reddog and his rooters were alive once moid.
Across the way, Cal let up a moaning cry,
And Pappy, fat Pappy, dabbed a hankie to his eye.
Bui, wait, wait! Referee Cain had something (o say,
"Stanford can't score a touchdow'n in that way."
"For that I'll have to penalize Stanford twice.
"Why? 'Cause Pappy paid me off so nice."
"Thataway," shouted the bay-windowed headman;
"Thataway to stop the upstart Redman."
From the benches black with people came up a muffled roar
Like the beating of the storm waves on a stern and distant shorn.
"Kill him, kill the ref," shouted someone hi the stand,
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Pappy raised his hand
Well-mannered Marchie was really getting mad,
And he shouted to Gary, "California must be had!"
So Gary, mighty Gary, threw a bullet to McColl
And laded back again, and again tossed Bill the Ball.
The quarter ended with the Axe Yell refrain,
And no one could doubt that Stanford would cross that goal again.
So when Gary put his hand upon the bladder,
Pappy, ponderous Pappy, knew something was the matter.
Gary cocked his arm and let the bladder fly
And it made its historic course across the Berkeley sky.
Benson neatly took the ball and crossed the Bear.ville goal
As the eighty thousand people shook the massive Berkeley Bowl.

Then Pappy, hetty Pappy, gave out a sobbing shrill
That echoed through the stadium and bounced off Tightwad Hill.
It bent the grass on that muddy, sodden field,
And knocked a piece of plaster off the crumbling Campanile.
Oh. everywhere on this favored Farm the sun is shining bright,
The Cellar "roughs" are happy, and Quad hearts are ilight,
And at Rickey's and at L'O'mmie's, Stanford fratmeri sin,
But there is no joy in Berkeley, mighty Pappy didn't win.
