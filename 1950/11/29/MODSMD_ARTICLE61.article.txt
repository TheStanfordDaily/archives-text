thrice handicapped. Two first
string backs, Sam Thornton, left
full, and Louie Lane, left half, have
labs they cannot make up.

their last game has caused some let- I
down on the team, and the lack of 1
practice due to rain and the Big
Game weekend has left the squad j
somewhat out of shape. *
However, the team boards a bus
for Berkeley today at 1 p.m. "in
high spirits and with the coach's
fingers crossed," according to Coach
Graham.
