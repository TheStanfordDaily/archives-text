# Manless Stanford--Like a Boat Without a Rudder?
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Spring quarter, 1943: A girl named Janet McClanahan becomes
the first woman president in ASSU history. For the first time a
woman sits at the Daily's editor's desk. Chairwomen lead the j
major campus organizations and committees.
What was happening? Where were the men? Well, some

were in the Army, some were in the
Navy, some in the Marine Corps. . . .
There was a war on.
The World War II draft stripped
Stanford of nearly all of its civilian
men. No one can say if that's going
to happen again. But this quarter
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler told fraternity representatives
that a "new deferment program" is
being considered in government cir- j
clcs, which, if it goes into effect, '
would take one-half of Stanford's
sophomores, two-thirds of its juniors,
and three-fourths of its seniors.
Suppose this did happen. What
would a manless Stanford be like?
Here's what it was like last time:
After Pearl Harbor, the ratio
started falling. By winter quarter, J
1012, each Stanford woman had
only 1.94 men. A year later the ra
tio had dropped to 1.15. And the
depths were still ahead. In April.
I!>4.'{. the Army took Stanford's En
listed Reserve Corps. The ratio
then: 10 girls to one man. But sol- j
diers later brought to the campus
lifted the ratio.
Minus the men, Stanford women I
started taking over. Girls broke pre- |
cedents to become ASSU president ; j
Daily editor; and Gaieties director. \
A girl headed the War Board, the i
committee which co-ordinated the
entire campus war effort.
But the Farm just wasn't designed
to he a women's world. At registra- j
lion, the women's lines stretched oul |
in front of two windows. The men j
had four. In 19411 ASSU president
•Jack Reynolds was drafted. But he- j
fore a woman could take his place, a j
constitutional amendment had to be |
p.issed.
Girls on the Row started serving
their own meals. The Cellar and the
Union Dining cut down their
open hours. Not enough hashers!
Social lives began to suffer. At
tempting to snare workers, the
Daily pointed out:
"Women can bolster their morale,
falling with the ratio, by a few
nights at the Daily Shack, where
the telephone rings all the time."
Football fell by the wayside in '43,
and a few months later Stanford
withdrew from other major sports.
The time came when the Daily .sports
page featured a story headlined "Golf
Prospects Fine."
To battle the argument that col
lege was frivolous in wartime, the
Administration revamped the cur
riculum. Courses like aircraft draft
ing and map-making were added.
Girls were offered stenography and
social service courses. There was
even an applied nutrition class, where
girls who didn't know that apple peel
keeps cauliflower white could find it
out.
The male civilian exodus changed
the campus residence set-up. The
draft-emptied fraternity houses
were made civilian residence halls.
Their Greek names were turned
presidential—to titles like "Harri
son Hall." The Navy took over
Brainier, and the Army moved into
Encina.
Quad looked different, too. All
street signs were taken down (they
might help enemy invaders.) Uni
fomed platoons marched from class to
class.
And if the wartime freshmen
looked younger, many of them were.
High school seniors who could pass
the other entrance requirements were
admitted after they'd completed three
months of their final high school
year.
