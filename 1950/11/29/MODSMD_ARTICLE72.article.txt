# Stanford Grotto Members Explore Subterranean Lake
## 
### 
Stanford Grotto members. George
Moore and Edward Danhey con
firmed the existence of a subterra
i nean emerald lake in Pinnacle
Point Cave in their cave explora
tions over the Thanksgiving vaca
tion.
The students descended the cave
passages 75 feet, often crawling
through passages barely large
enough for their rubber raft. After
finding the subterranean lake, they
were soon forced to abandon the
boat and swim through narrow,
low - roofed passages to outlying |
caverns.
The two explorers, roaming Cala
veras and Tuolumne counties, dis
covered four new caves in lime
stone bluffs overlooking the Stanis
i laus River.
• Another Stanford Grotto group
composed of Neil Bostick, Jack

Jacobus, Art Lange, and George
Mowat, investigated caves in Men
docino, Trinity, and Shasta coun
ties.
Although a day of search failed
to uncover the extensive Rock Fault
Cave, the party was able to row
across Shasta Reservoir to complete
exploration of Baird Cave. As this
! was late last Friday, the party held
j an impromptu Big Game rally in
j the boat.
The Grotto first explored Baird
j Cave last September. It is consid
ered to be the largest in California.
The Group also located Potter
! Creek Cave, from which Dr. J. C.
Merriam of the Carnegie Institu
tion took a large fossil collection in
I 1903. The excavations were still ev
! ident, the paleontologists and ar
| cheologists having dug 13 feet deep
| into the floor of the main room.
