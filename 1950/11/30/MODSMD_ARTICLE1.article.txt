LAKE SUCCESS, U.Y., Nov. 2!>
(UP) —The United States today de
manded the "earliest possible vote"
on a resolution ordering the Chi
nese Communists out of Korea.
The U.S. pressed its charges I
against Communist China at the
meeting of the United Nations Sc
eurity Council. Ambassador War- j
rrn R. Austin, American delegate
t<> Iho Security Council, branded |
yesterday's charges of U.S. "aggres
sion" by Gen. Wn Hsui-Chuan. Pe- I
king envoy to the UN, as "distor- I
tions, slanders, half-truths, and out- '
right lies."
Austin, taking the floor for the
st cond straight day, called for a I
quick vote ordering tine Chinese j
Rods out of Korea, but said he j
would not press for a decision to
night because some delegations still {
awaited instructions from their I
governments.
He ripped into the belligerent
speech in which Wu charged yes- I
terday that the U.S. "aggression" j
against Korea and Formosa was de- j
signed to pave the way for more j
attacks on China and "stir up a
Third World War."
Austin started off by repeating his j
portentous question of yesterday:
"Will there he peace or war in the |
Far East?"
