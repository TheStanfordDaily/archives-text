TOKYO, Thursday, Nov. 30 (UP) —The U.S. Second Infantry
and First Cavalry Divisions battled hordes of Chinese Commu
nists with bayonets and hand grenades throughout the night, and
battlefield dispatches today said the "front" no longer existed.
American Army divisions on the northwest front fought a sav-

"age hand-to-hand rearguard action
with bayonets and hand grenades
that enabled most of the United
Nations army to ficc an enemy trap
in hopes of setting up a new defen
sive line north and northeast of
Pyongyang.
The attack by Chinese armed with
rifles, machineguns, and mortars
climaxed smaller attacks that began
at 'i p.m. Wednesday from the
northeast and at midnight, from the
west. The enemy 'lias an estimated
five divisions — 50,000 men —in the
area.
The Communists attacking un
ceasingly drove most of the United
Nations armies southward in full
retreat toward threatened Pyong
yang. Some Communist units were
reported operating 10 miles from
the former North Korean capital.
The Turkish troops after two days
under constant attack were using
fists, rocks, and anything they could
find against the Chinese.
Two battalions of the Second Di
vision's 38th Regiment were over
run as they rushed to the aid of
the embattled Turks, Ixit at 3 a.m.
today the enemy was forced to
withdraw.
The 23rd Regiment succeeded in
forming a defensive line through
which the 38th and the Turks could
retreat and were poised for another
bloody hand-to-hand struggle with
the onrushing Reds.
Twenty-seven miles to the south
in the vicinity of Sunchon, 20 miles
above Pyongyang, First Cavalry
men slaughtered more than 500
j Communists but the enemy kept
sending in never ending waves of
fresh troops to shove them back.
The Air Force literally was rain
ing fire on enemy cavalry and foot
troops. Fighter - bombers hurled
flaming napalm bombs and R-20's
and R-2fi\s, which dropped 500 tons
of incendiaries yesterday, were out
I in force this morning.
