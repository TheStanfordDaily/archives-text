Football Team.

pass - catching end and defensive"*
star Bill McColl and Rose Bowl- i
bound California's fine linebacker
guard Les Richter. McColl, a 20- .
year - old junior from San Diego, |
broke all PCC pass-catching rec
ords during the 1050 season. Mc-
Coll and Richter were the only two
Westerners named on the first two
AU-American teams.
It marked the first time in years
that either the Midwest or East
hasn't dominated the mythical all
star team which this season was
chosen by ballots from 352 sports
writers and football broadcasters
from all sections of. the country.
Two players from the undefeated
and untied Oklahoma Sooners and
one each from Texas and Southern j
Methodist cave the Southwest the j
sectional honors among the players j
chosen as the finest at their posi- |
tions this year,
Oklahoma contributed its great
tackle, Jim Wcathcrall, and its ex
plosive back, Leon Heath; Texas
guard Lewis (Bud) MeFadin and
SMU its giant-killer ofTensic star,
Kyle (The Killer) Rote.
From I lie Midwest, came center
Jerry Groom and back Bobby Wil
liams of once-mighty Notre Dame
and Vic: Janowicz, the touchdown
scoring wizard of Ohio State. Guard
Les Richter and end Bill McColl
rcprcsenterl the Far West with end
Dan Foldberg of Army and tackle
Bob Gain of Kentucky selected
from the East and South, respec
tively.
It is a mighty eleven averaging
,220 pounds to a man in the line and
ISO pounds per player in the back
field. Il is the coach's dream for a
defensive rock of Gibraltar and an
offensive geared to the modern
high-scoring type of football.
There is nothing lacking in bal
ance. The majority of the players
play on both defensive and offen
j sive platoons and those who spe
| cializc in one branch or the otlicr
! do so at a coach's direction and not
I because they lack ability.
There is, for instance. Foldberg
jof Army, generally acclaimed as
I one of the greatest ends college foo
j one of the greatest ends college
j football ever lias produced.

because ho is the finest defensive
j lineman on my squad." Coach Earl
I (Red) Blaik of Army said. "But he
■ plays with such abandon, I know
lie would bust himself up if I kept
j him out there all the time."
Blaik went even further and for
i the first time in his coaching career
I at West Point — which included the
j World Waf II glory years of Doc
Blanchard and Glenn Davis — sin
gled out his star end as the most
valuable player on the squad. Be
fore that, he was content to apply
his laurels to his players- never to
any individual.
Foldberg led the linemen in bal
: loting. scoring a total of 2.. r >lo points.
Janowicz. however, was the out
: standing player on a point system,
scoring 3,041 out of a possible 3.872
| points.
Except for the fourth spot in the
backlield, which Williams won to
become the only repeater from the
I United Press 1010 All - America
team, no contest for an all - star
berth was close.
Williams nosed out Vic Parilli,
the passing ace of Kentucky, by ti2
points—l,473 against 1,411 —for the
fourth backfield spot.
The next closest race was for cen
ter where Groom, the iron man and
captain of Notre Dame, defeated Irv
Holdash of North Carolina by 342
points.
The Midwest dominated the sec
ond team, winning six berths with
the South getting three and the East
two.
Ends Bob Carey of Michigan
State and Don Stonesifer of North
western, tackles Bill Trautwein of
Ohio State and A 1 Wahl of Michi
gan, and backs Bobby Reynolds of
Nebraska and Everett Grandelius of
Michigan State came from the Mid
west football lands.
In addition to Holdash, the South
representatives and the mythical
eleven were Parilli and Bob Ward,
Maryland's hard-hitting guard. Both
of the second-team East nominees
I came from Pennsylvania — guard

Bernie Lemonick and backfield star
Francis (Reds) Bagnell.
Of the first team, six are seniors.
Foldberg, Richter, Weatherall, Mc-
Coll and Janowicz are juniors and
will be back on the nation's grid
irons next season.

NEW YORK, Nov. 29 (UP) —Four players from the Southwest,
three from the Midwest, two from the Far West and one each
from the East and South were chosen today as the finest college
football players in the land—the 1950 United Press All-America
Football Team.
The two Far-western footballers named were Stanford's groat

pass - catching end and defensive"*
star Bill McColl and Rose Bowl- i
bound California's fine linebacker
guard Les Richter. McColl, a 20- .
year - old junior from San Diego, |
broke all PCC pass-catching rec
ords during the 1050 season. Mc-
Coll and Richter were the only two
Westerners named on the first two
AU-American teams.
It marked the first time in years
that either the Midwest or East
hasn't dominated the mythical all
star team which this season was
chosen by ballots from 352 sports
writers and football broadcasters
from all sections of. the country.
Two players from the undefeated
and untied Oklahoma Sooners and
one each from Texas and Southern j
Methodist cave the Southwest the j
sectional honors among the players j
chosen as the finest at their posi- |
tions this year,
Oklahoma contributed its great
tackle, Jim Wcathcrall, and its ex
plosive back, Leon Heath; Texas
guard Lewis (Bud) MeFadin and
SMU its giant-killer ofTensic star,
Kyle (The Killer) Rote.
From I lie Midwest, came center
Jerry Groom and back Bobby Wil
liams of once-mighty Notre Dame
and Vic: Janowicz, the touchdown
scoring wizard of Ohio State. Guard
Les Richter and end Bill McColl
rcprcsenterl the Far West with end
Dan Foldberg of Army and tackle
Bob Gain of Kentucky selected
from the East and South, respec
tively.
It is a mighty eleven averaging
,220 pounds to a man in the line and
ISO pounds per player in the back
field. Il is the coach's dream for a
defensive rock of Gibraltar and an
offensive geared to the modern
high-scoring type of football.
There is nothing lacking in bal
ance. The majority of the players
play on both defensive and offen
j sive platoons and those who spe
| cializc in one branch or the otlicr
! do so at a coach's direction and not
I because they lack ability.
There is, for instance. Foldberg
jof Army, generally acclaimed as
I one of the greatest ends college foo
j one of the greatest ends college
j football ever lias produced.
1 know his potential on dcfen.r,
because ho is the finest defensive
j lineman on my squad." Coach Earl
I (Red) Blaik of Army said. "But he
■ plays with such abandon, I know
lie would bust himself up if I kept
j him out there all the time."
Blaik went even further and for
i the first time in his coaching career
I at West Point — which included the
j World Waf II glory years of Doc
Blanchard and Glenn Davis — sin
gled out his star end as the most
valuable player on the squad. Be
fore that, he was content to apply
his laurels to his players- never to
any individual.
Foldberg led the linemen in bal
: loting. scoring a total of 2.. r >lo points.
Janowicz. however, was the out
: standing player on a point system,
scoring 3,041 out of a possible 3.872
| points.
Except for the fourth spot in the
backlield, which Williams won to
become the only repeater from the
I United Press 1010 All - America
team, no contest for an all - star
berth was close.
Williams nosed out Vic Parilli,
the passing ace of Kentucky, by ti2
points—l,473 against 1,411 —for the
fourth backfield spot.
The next closest race was for cen
ter where Groom, the iron man and
captain of Notre Dame, defeated Irv
Holdash of North Carolina by 342
points.
The Midwest dominated the sec
ond team, winning six berths with
the South getting three and the East
two.
Ends Bob Carey of Michigan
State and Don Stonesifer of North
western, tackles Bill Trautwein of
Ohio State and A 1 Wahl of Michi
gan, and backs Bobby Reynolds of
Nebraska and Everett Grandelius of
Michigan State came from the Mid
west football lands.
In addition to Holdash, the South
representatives and the mythical
eleven were Parilli and Bob Ward,
Maryland's hard-hitting guard. Both
of the second-team East nominees
I came from Pennsylvania — guard

Bernie Lemonick and backfield star
Francis (Reds) Bagnell.
Of the first team, six are seniors.
Foldberg, Richter, Weatherall, Mc-
Coll and Janowicz are juniors and
will be back on the nation's grid
irons next season.
