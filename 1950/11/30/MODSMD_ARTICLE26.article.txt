# Workshop Planning
## 
### 
Representatives of campus organizations
will meet today to map out plans lor the sec
ond annual Student Workshop to be held next
quarter. These workshops, sponsored by the
YWCA, are planned to give student organiza
tions ari opportunity to discuss problems of
student life and to channel suggestions to the
organizations best equipped to carry them out.
Several concrete activities were set in mo
tion as a result of "he discussions in the "Y"-
sponsored workshop last year. The re-estab
lishment of the YMCA on campu; this fall, the
otganization of quarterly relief drives under
the sponsorship of Cardinals, and the setting
up of a forum to co-ordinate the activities of
rarnpus clubs are the major results of last
year's v/orkshop to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of student action.
V/ith constantly changing campus problems,

the 1951 Student Workshop can again provide
the necessary sounding board lor new plans.
Here organizations can come to give sugges
tions that they cannot carry out themselves and
leave with new ideas for club projects.
The "Y" committee sponsoring the Work
shop has sent letters to all organizations on
campus asking them to send representatives
to the planning conference this afternoon. This
planning committee can set the ball rolling for
a repetition of the success of the initial Stu
dent Workshop with action on constantly
changing campus problems.
The YWCA is pioneering again in sponsor
ing an organization that has the potential to
develop into an independent organization, as
did the sponsoring system and the Institute
of International Relations which were origi
nated under the auspices of the YWCA.â€”
