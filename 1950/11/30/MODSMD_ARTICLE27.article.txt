### VIC PALMIERI 
I see where the new time schedules are out. Some
day I'm going to find the guy who draws those babies
up. I'm going to get him a new job. Anyone who can
tin 11 out such works oi s'heer genius year alter year
should be spending his time discovering relativity or

something . . . not making up class
Ethed ules.
Because the Stanford Time
Schedule represents the highest
achievement of the human mind
Since Newton discovered apples.
How else can so many classes be
arranged so that not one of some
2,000 students can possibly take
the particular course he needs or

wants? Think of the incredible intelligence required
to invent a system that anticipates every possible
preference on the part of each student and frustrates
every one!
Every quarter when the new schedule comes out I
discover one class that I really want to take midst the
welter oi major requirements and minor requirements
and prerequisites . . . one little class that could light
a spark of interest among the dead ashes in my mental
incinerator. And I'll be doggoned if every single time

they don't have that schedule fixed so the only way I
can take that one little class is to go without breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.
But even if you do decide you don't really mind
taking Anatomy 141 (Dissection of the Human Body)
instead of English Poets of the Renaissance, you still
need a Rosetta Stone, to figure out when, where, and
by whom the course is being given. The guy who
makes up the schedule must be a Shriner, there are
so many secret symbols in the thing. For instance:
*340. Mineralogy of Sediments. TTh (Lab. (1) MW 3-5
&dhr (Pebblehead, 21pe) (3).
Now you tell me what they're talking about. I could
do better with the hieroglyphics on Kin Tut's tomb.
What does mean? . . . for men only? , And how
about dhr . . . sounds pretty loose to me. And all
those numbers . . . my father took one look at it and
gave me five buck to put up on Near East in the Fifth
with Vucinich up. (I told him the only window they've
got at this track is the $220 one.)
I wouldn't mind so much but it gets pretty expensive
sending back every quarter to have the Harvard Cal
culator work out my schedule. Of Course, that was
only a last resort. I wanted to be a history major and
I kept winding up in classes at the Hopkins Marine
Station.

do better with the hieroglyphics on Kin Tut's tomb.
What does mean? . . . for men only? , And how
about dhr . . . sounds pretty loose to me. And all
those numbers . . . my father took one look at it and
gave me five buck to put up on Near East in the Fifth
with Vucinich up. (I told him the only window they've
got at this track is the $220 one.)
I wouldn't mind so much but it gets pretty expensive
sending back every quarter to have the Harvard Cal
culator work out my schedule. Of Course, that was
only a last resort. I wanted to be a history major and
I kept winding up in classes at the Hopkins Marine
Station.

I see where the new time schedules are out. Some
day I'm going to find the guy who draws those babies
up. I'm going to get him a new job. Anyone who can
tin 11 out such works oi s'heer genius year alter year
should be spending his time discovering relativity or

something . . . not making up class
Ethed ules.
Because the Stanford Time
Schedule represents the highest
achievement of the human mind
Since Newton discovered apples.
How else can so many classes be
arranged so that not one of some
2,000 students can possibly take
the particular course he needs or

wants? Think of the incredible intelligence required
to invent a system that anticipates every possible
preference on the part of each student and frustrates
every one!
Every quarter when the new schedule comes out I
discover one class that I really want to take midst the
welter oi major requirements and minor requirements
and prerequisites . . . one little class that could light
a spark of interest among the dead ashes in my mental
incinerator. And I'll be doggoned if every single time

they don't have that schedule fixed so the only way I
can take that one little class is to go without breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.
But even if you do decide you don't really mind
taking Anatomy 141 (Dissection of the Human Body)
instead of English Poets of the Renaissance, you still
need a Rosetta Stone, to figure out when, where, and
by whom the course is being given. The guy who
makes up the schedule must be a Shriner, there are
so many secret symbols in the thing. For instance:
*340. Mineralogy of Sediments. TTh (Lab. (1) MW 3-5
&dhr (Pebblehead, 21pe) (3).
Now you tell me what they're talking about. I could
do better with the hieroglyphics on Kin Tut's tomb.
