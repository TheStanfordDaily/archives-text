# CAMPUS OPINION
## Answering Donald E. Close 
### 
To the Editor:
Don Close's comments on the Stanford Health Ser\»*-
ice hardly warrant reply. However, for the record:
1. Ihe quality of the medical services offered by the
Health Service is on a par with that available any
where in the world.
'ii ut\ those suffering from the common cold may
have to wait lor service, but those who are really sick
;;et prompt and specialized care.
2. 'Ihe Stanford Health Service is neither socialistic
nor communistic. The University is a private institu
tion offering two services—instruction and medical—
in a "package deal" at $220.00 per quarter.
This situation is exactly analogous to the policy of
those hotels which offer room and board in a "package
deal."
r l hose people who don't like "package deals" are free
to leave hotels or universities which offer them.

To liit- Editor:
I am in sympathy with Donald E. Close and his ex
pix vi <<i concern over the spreading of communism and
socialism here at home.
What troubles me, however, is why he should train
his guns upon a small outfit like the Stanford Public
Health Service inoculates and indoctrinates but
8,000-odd students, n he really wishes to get to the
loots of communist breeding in the USA, why doesn't
he expose a domestic institution wh'.:h is 100 per cent
communistic—the family.
Ah, the family, there is a communistic cell, a tyran
nical one, at that! A child is brought into his family
without having a voice in the matter.
His color, be it brown, white, or yellow, as well as
his religious upbringing are foisted upon him. And
where else but within the family is the communistic
slogan, "from each according to his ability, to each ac
cording to his needs,' more closely lollowed?
Father earns the money, and although he may never
u.;e Stanford facilities, he pays the tuition and ex
penses. Even the most naive person can see what a
pieiedent for communism this practice sets.
II w< are to be consistent in our opposition to com
munism, we should insist upon immediate discon
tinuance <.112 the "thinly disguised" communist experi
ment. the family.

To the Editor:
I am unsure as to whether Mr. Close's contribution
to Reaction at Stanford was intended as a dubious
satire, a i.id for local immortality of a sort, or a sincere
defense of what is a scarcely defensible position.
However, if Mr. Close intends his remarks to be
taken seriously, I beg to point out to him that the
presence on this campus of a public service, supported
by "every student, regardless of race, color, creed, or
status" and operated for the benefit of all who with to
partake of its facilities is essentially democratic.
Does Mr. Close mean to imply that inefficiencies at
tendant upon the operation of this service are inherent j
in any thinly disguised "socialistic" enterprise? This
is an implication usually reserved for our most purely
democratic institutions.
If Mr. Close wishes to be consistent in his opposition
to communism, he would do better to support those
facilities on this campus which are most democratic—
such as the Student Health Service—and contain his
remai ks to such areas where they might not appear so
ridiculous.
LAUROSEBECKER JANIS HUBNER

To the Editor:
In his letter to the Daily opposing the Health Serv
ice. which he believes to be a form of socialism, Mr.
Donald E. Close emphasizes the importance of con
sistency.
I disagree with Mr. Close on many issues, but I agree
with him that consistency is a virtue.
Therefore, 1 respectfully suggest to Mr. Close that
he, inorder to be consistent in his opposition to any
form of socialism, public or private, forego collecting
his share ol the Bookstore rebates, refrain from using
the U.S. Postal Service, and discontinue using the
government-financed public highways.

To the Editor:
I/.t never be said that Stanford is not up with na
tional events. Washington lias its McCarthy, Sacra
mento has it.vTcnney, and Stanford points with PRIDE
to its own Donald E. Close!
