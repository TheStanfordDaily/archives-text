# On The Bench With Al Berry
## 
### 
With the grid-game giving way to Everett Dean's hoopsters tomorrow
night, the time for Ail-American picking, wild praises, and warm memories
is now at hand.
Stanford, in the person ol Bill McColl, has its first .All-American since
Chuck lay lor and one of its finest Ail-Americans of all time. Earlier in j
the week McColl made the defensive squau of Hearst's INS Ail-American. j
Today (see page one) Big Bill has been named on the United Press's very |
important All-American squad. Tomorrow, my sources tell me, McColl will
be named on Collier's All-USA squad, and after that the Look, Saturday
Evening Post, and Associated Press Ail-American.
liill, the sources say, is the only Pacilic Coast }*ridder to make the Col
lier's team. lii short, the big, likeable, average-raiser is pretty much a
unanimous choice all over the country. He has even made the all-all
teams of several Eastern newspapers—the Boston Globe for one.
This, needless to say, is a great thing lor McColl, and it is even a greater
thirifi for Stanford. Stanford has been in the agony of rebuilding its foot
ball might after the Dark Age of World War II and the insidious lootball
tactics of the late lamented Dr. Don Tresidder. As last season demonstrated,
Stanford has not yet achieved her goal—the renaissance is not yet at hand.
But having an All-American on the squad—especially an All-American ol
the caliber and character of Bill McColl —is going to give our grid program
a tremendous boost.
Today—just for laughs—we are going to pick an All-Coast team. It won t
help bring any aspiring frosh football players to Stanford, because some
Indians are on it, but it is a way the Bench can pay tribute to eleven or
so guys who gave us some thrills and some fine memories ol the 1950 joot
ball season.
We feel that we are as qualified as any to make this selection—after all we
were the ones who, at the start ol the season, picked USC to go to the Rose
Bowl. Here goes:
ENDS: McColl (Stanford), Cloidt (Washington).
TACKLES: Poineroy (Stanford), Stroschein (UCLA).
GUARDS: Richter (California), Cone (Stanford).
• CENTER: Moomaw (UCLA).
QUARTERBACK: Heinrich (Washington).
HALFBACKS: Monachino (California), Schabarum (Calif.).
FULLBACK: Olszewski (California).
Now, if that doesn't meet with your approval, we have another all-team
today. This is one which nobody has yet picked, and we think it is more
exciting to pick a new type of all-all team, than to go out and name a bunch
of All-Americans. So, today we give you an all-Stanford team since the war.
These men are chosen for their ability to play both offense and defense,
and if we could have this'team in one piece, even Stanford might go lo the
Rose Bowl.
ENDS: McColl (1!)50), Rose (1949).
TACKLES: Poineroy (1950), Cox (1946).
GUARDS: Hachton (194(5), Cone (1950).
CENTER: Castagnoli (1949).
QUARTERBACK: Kerkorian (November 25, 1950).
HALFBACKS: Quist (1947). White (1950).
FULLBACK: Merriman (194(5).
For depth, we could use the likes ol Dick Madigan (1940), Fred Boensch
(1946), A 1 Rau (1949), Bruce Van Alstyne (1950), and—blazes—White, Ma
noogian, Benson, Hugasian, Eller, and Don Fix. It's a nice thing to speculate
over.
This'is the last "On The Bench" that will appear in the Stanford Daily.
We've been pounding out the Bench for going on three years now, and—like
all good things—it has come to an end. We started to make this a long, sad
farewell to sports, but just couldn't do it. Because there has been no sad
ness involved in writing it. I—Al Berry, the guy—have gained an awful lot
by being able to talk sports with you once a week. I hope that you, too, have
been able to glean some bit of pleasure, information, or enthusiasm from my
column.
1 want to thank so many people for making this effort on my part possible,
but space does not permit a full list of names. I should mention such people
as Jawn Hall, my first sports editor, John Breier, with whom I often quar
reled and with whom I more often drank beer. To the men of the Athletic
Department: Don Liebendorfer, Chuck Taylor, the greatest guy of all times.
To the coaches: Dutch, Phil, Mai, Marchie, Pete, Ray Hammett, Ray Lunny,
and Ray Dean. To Smiling Jack Weiershauser, one of the best trackmen in
the business, and Everett Dean and Bob Burnett. To Dr. Sterling and . . .
Well, I could go on forever.
There are so many people who have made this column possible, and I can t
mention you all or thank you all enough.
Now before I start to cry all over my copy paper, we'll say the traditional
"thirty," good-bye, and good luck.
By the way, anybody know of any good jobs outside of the newspaper
mcket that are open for an ex-sportswriter with expensive tastes?

mcket that are open for an ex-sportswriter with expensive tastes?
With the grid-game giving way to Everett Dean's hoopsters tomorrow
night, the time for Ail-American picking, wild praises, and warm memories
is now at hand.
Stanford, in the person ol Bill McColl, has its first .All-American since
Chuck lay lor and one of its finest Ail-Americans of all time. Earlier in j
the week McColl made the defensive squau of Hearst's INS Ail-American. j
Today (see page one) Big Bill has been named on the United Press's very |
important All-American squad. Tomorrow, my sources tell me, McColl will
be named on Collier's All-USA squad, and after that the Look, Saturday
Evening Post, and Associated Press Ail-American.
liill, the sources say, is the only Pacilic Coast }*ridder to make the Col
lier's team. lii short, the big, likeable, average-raiser is pretty much a
unanimous choice all over the country. He has even made the all-all
teams of several Eastern newspapers—the Boston Globe for one.
This, needless to say, is a great thing lor McColl, and it is even a greater
thirifi for Stanford. Stanford has been in the agony of rebuilding its foot
ball might after the Dark Age of World War II and the insidious lootball
tactics of the late lamented Dr. Don Tresidder. As last season demonstrated,
Stanford has not yet achieved her goal—the renaissance is not yet at hand.
But having an All-American on the squad—especially an All-American ol
the caliber and character of Bill McColl —is going to give our grid program
a tremendous boost.
Today—just for laughs—we are going to pick an All-Coast team. It won t
help bring any aspiring frosh football players to Stanford, because some
Indians are on it, but it is a way the Bench can pay tribute to eleven or
so guys who gave us some thrills and some fine memories ol the 1950 joot
ball season.
We feel that we are as qualified as any to make this selection—after all we
were the ones who, at the start ol the season, picked USC to go to the Rose
Bowl. Here goes:
ENDS: McColl (Stanford), Cloidt (Washington).
TACKLES: Poineroy (Stanford), Stroschein (UCLA).
GUARDS: Richter (California), Cone (Stanford).
• CENTER: Moomaw (UCLA).
QUARTERBACK: Heinrich (Washington).
HALFBACKS: Monachino (California), Schabarum (Calif.).
FULLBACK: Olszewski (California).
Now, if that doesn't meet with your approval, we have another all-team
today. This is one which nobody has yet picked, and we think it is more
exciting to pick a new type of all-all team, than to go out and name a bunch
of All-Americans. So, today we give you an all-Stanford team since the war.
These men are chosen for their ability to play both offense and defense,
and if we could have this'team in one piece, even Stanford might go lo the
Rose Bowl.
ENDS: McColl (1!)50), Rose (1949).
TACKLES: Poineroy (1950), Cox (1946).
GUARDS: Hachton (194(5), Cone (1950).
CENTER: Castagnoli (1949).
QUARTERBACK: Kerkorian (November 25, 1950).
HALFBACKS: Quist (1947). White (1950).
FULLBACK: Merriman (194(5).
For depth, we could use the likes ol Dick Madigan (1940), Fred Boensch
(1946), A 1 Rau (1949), Bruce Van Alstyne (1950), and—blazes—White, Ma
noogian, Benson, Hugasian, Eller, and Don Fix. It's a nice thing to speculate
over.
This'is the last "On The Bench" that will appear in the Stanford Daily.
We've been pounding out the Bench for going on three years now, and—like
all good things—it has come to an end. We started to make this a long, sad
farewell to sports, but just couldn't do it. Because there has been no sad
ness involved in writing it. I—Al Berry, the guy—have gained an awful lot
by being able to talk sports with you once a week. I hope that you, too, have
been able to glean some bit of pleasure, information, or enthusiasm from my
column.
1 want to thank so many people for making this effort on my part possible,
but space does not permit a full list of names. I should mention such people
as Jawn Hall, my first sports editor, John Breier, with whom I often quar
reled and with whom I more often drank beer. To the men of the Athletic
Department: Don Liebendorfer, Chuck Taylor, the greatest guy of all times.
To the coaches: Dutch, Phil, Mai, Marchie, Pete, Ray Hammett, Ray Lunny,
and Ray Dean. To Smiling Jack Weiershauser, one of the best trackmen in
the business, and Everett Dean and Bob Burnett. To Dr. Sterling and . . .
Well, I could go on forever.
There are so many people who have made this column possible, and I can t
mention you all or thank you all enough.
Now before I start to cry all over my copy paper, we'll say the traditional
"thirty," good-bye, and good luck.

"thirty," good-bye, and good luck.
By the way, anybody know of any good jobs outside of the newspaper
mcket that are open for an ex-sportswriter with expensive tastes?
With the grid-game giving way to Everett Dean's hoopsters tomorrow
night, the time for Ail-American picking, wild praises, and warm memories
is now at hand.
Stanford, in the person ol Bill McColl, has its first .All-American since
Chuck lay lor and one of its finest Ail-Americans of all time. Earlier in j
the week McColl made the defensive squau of Hearst's INS Ail-American. j
Today (see page one) Big Bill has been named on the United Press's very |
important All-American squad. Tomorrow, my sources tell me, McColl will
be named on Collier's All-USA squad, and after that the Look, Saturday
Evening Post, and Associated Press Ail-American.
liill, the sources say, is the only Pacilic Coast }*ridder to make the Col
lier's team. lii short, the big, likeable, average-raiser is pretty much a
unanimous choice all over the country. He has even made the all-all
teams of several Eastern newspapers—the Boston Globe for one.
This, needless to say, is a great thing lor McColl, and it is even a greater
thirifi for Stanford. Stanford has been in the agony of rebuilding its foot
ball might after the Dark Age of World War II and the insidious lootball
tactics of the late lamented Dr. Don Tresidder. As last season demonstrated,
Stanford has not yet achieved her goal—the renaissance is not yet at hand.
But having an All-American on the squad—especially an All-American ol
the caliber and character of Bill McColl —is going to give our grid program
a tremendous boost.
Today—just for laughs—we are going to pick an All-Coast team. It won t
help bring any aspiring frosh football players to Stanford, because some
Indians are on it, but it is a way the Bench can pay tribute to eleven or
so guys who gave us some thrills and some fine memories ol the 1950 joot
ball season.
We feel that we are as qualified as any to make this selection—after all we
were the ones who, at the start ol the season, picked USC to go to the Rose
Bowl. Here goes:
ENDS: McColl (Stanford), Cloidt (Washington).
TACKLES: Poineroy (Stanford), Stroschein (UCLA).
GUARDS: Richter (California), Cone (Stanford).
• CENTER: Moomaw (UCLA).
QUARTERBACK: Heinrich (Washington).
HALFBACKS: Monachino (California), Schabarum (Calif.).
FULLBACK: Olszewski (California).
Now, if that doesn't meet with your approval, we have another all-team
today. This is one which nobody has yet picked, and we think it is more
exciting to pick a new type of all-all team, than to go out and name a bunch
of All-Americans. So, today we give you an all-Stanford team since the war.
These men are chosen for their ability to play both offense and defense,
and if we could have this'team in one piece, even Stanford might go lo the
Rose Bowl.
ENDS: McColl (1!)50), Rose (1949).
TACKLES: Poineroy (1950), Cox (1946).
GUARDS: Hachton (194(5), Cone (1950).
CENTER: Castagnoli (1949).
QUARTERBACK: Kerkorian (November 25, 1950).
HALFBACKS: Quist (1947). White (1950).
FULLBACK: Merriman (194(5).
For depth, we could use the likes ol Dick Madigan (1940), Fred Boensch
(1946), A 1 Rau (1949), Bruce Van Alstyne (1950), and—blazes—White, Ma
noogian, Benson, Hugasian, Eller, and Don Fix. It's a nice thing to speculate
over.
This'is the last "On The Bench" that will appear in the Stanford Daily.
We've been pounding out the Bench for going on three years now, and—like
all good things—it has come to an end. We started to make this a long, sad
farewell to sports, but just couldn't do it. Because there has been no sad
ness involved in writing it. I—Al Berry, the guy—have gained an awful lot
by being able to talk sports with you once a week. I hope that you, too, have
been able to glean some bit of pleasure, information, or enthusiasm from my
column.
1 want to thank so many people for making this effort on my part possible,
but space does not permit a full list of names. I should mention such people
as Jawn Hall, my first sports editor, John Breier, with whom I often quar
reled and with whom I more often drank beer. To the men of the Athletic
Department: Don Liebendorfer, Chuck Taylor, the greatest guy of all times.
To the coaches: Dutch, Phil, Mai, Marchie, Pete, Ray Hammett, Ray Lunny,
and Ray Dean. To Smiling Jack Weiershauser, one of the best trackmen in
the business, and Everett Dean and Bob Burnett. To Dr. Sterling and . . .
Well, I could go on forever.
