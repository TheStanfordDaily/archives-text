# Flashy Freshman Cagers Open Against Antioch High Tomorrow
## 
### 
Coach Bob Burnett will take off
the wraps of what may be one of
Stanford's greatest frosh basketball
teams tomorrow afternoon against
Antioch High School at the Encina
Gym.
Starting for the Papooses will be
forwards Don DeLong (6 ft. 2 in.)
and Hal Ellis (6 ft. 3 in.), center
Dave Epperson (6 ft. 6 in.), and
guards Don Carlson (6 ft. 4 in.) and
Oleg Suzdaleff (5 ft. 11 in.).
Other players who bear watching
are center Graham (Grande (6 ft.
5 in.), forwards Dennis Dickson,
Vincent Alliotti, and guard Tom
Green.
Late arrivals Sam Morley, Ray
Swartz, and Jack Gebbert have

traded their football gear for the
light basketball raiment. Morley,
especially, looks like a "comer."
