# Big Climb Replaces Big Game For Stanford's Alpine Club
## 
### 
When the Big Game kick-off went sailing through the air last
Saturday, 12 Stanford Alpiners were starting down from their
mass ascent of snow-covered Mt. Shasta in Northern California.
Jim Moore, A 1 Baxter, Dwight Crowder, Betsy Crowder, Karl
Stauffer, Jim Lee, Gail Fleming, Carol Teren, Mort Yelton, Jack

Maling, Steve Cowie, and Chet
Wrucke left three cars five miles
out of Mt. Shasta City where snow
blockcd the road.
From there they hiked to Horse
Camp, eight miles in eight hours,
where they celebrated Thanksgiv
ing with a 15-pound turkey. Leav
ing early Thursday it took the party
eight hours, climbing over snow and
ice, to reach their 13,000-foot camp
on Konwakiton Glacier.
During the night, the tempera
ture dropped to 10 degrees below
freezing. They left at 8:15 a.m. for
the 14,161-foot summit. The last
hundred feet the group encoun
tered 25 - degree temperature and
violent winds charged with snow
and ice.
The register at the peak was*
buried under three feet of ice and
snow. So the group left the top
after a few minutes to return to
their glacier camp by noon.
Last year, four members of the
Alpine Club were defeated in their
try for the top of Shasta by a storm
which kept them in a two-man tent
at 12,500 feet for 18 hours.
