# Chappie's Holiday Issue Coming Out
## 
### 
Practically any aid and assistance
any Stanford student needs this
Christmas is supplied, we are told,
by the December Chaparral, which
will go on sale Wednesday.
There's a gift section in case you
don't know what to present to your
relatives, a survey of Christmas
parties, and a Christmas • play-de
signed for fraternity parties, as well
as the usual yuks, cartoons, and
Queen —none -other, this time, than
Winsome Winnie Ainsworth.'
And a holiday fantasy for those
who, like the Chappie staff, haven't
grown up yet.
