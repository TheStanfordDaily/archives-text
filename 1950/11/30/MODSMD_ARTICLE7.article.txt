ALL-AMERICAN ANTICS—Above are three Stanford
Daily photos of the Indians' first All-American since
the "fabulous days of Forty." The first picture shows
McColl (3) leading halfback Harry "the Hipster" Hu
gasian (25) around the left end of the Oregon Stato
Beavers at Corvallis. The play was good for 28 yards.


Looking on is Card offensive center Dick Abraham (30)
The second photo shows the huge Stanford wingman
leaping for one of the passes that set up a Cardinal
touchdown near the end of the first half against Santa
Clara. As the referee looks blindly on, the Broncos'
frustrated but able defensive halfback Marie Formico

has grabbed hold of McColl's left elbow. McColl
caugjit the pass anyway. The pass was thrown by
quarterback Dick Horn. The third picture is one of
typical Big Game tenseness. McColl has just nabbed
a 20-yard pass from the arm of Gary Kerkorian. The
California rooting section is on its feet as defensive


halfback Dick LemMon leaps on McColl's back with
right hand tries to wrestle the ball from the Card All-
American. McColl dragged LemMon forward until hit
by Cal's great safetyman Don Robison (33). Golden
Bear halfback Joe Hibbs is rushing up to pile on. For
more on McColl, see sports.
