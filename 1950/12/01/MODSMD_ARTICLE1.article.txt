WASHINGTON, Nov. J» (UP) —
President Truman startled the
world today with a news confer
ence remark that the United States
is actively considering use of the
atom bomb to put down Communist
aggression in Korea.
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's bomb
er command is prepared to use the
atomic bomb within hours after
President Truman makes any such
'last resort" decision, the United
Press learned today.
However, it seemed apparent that
actually American military leaders
were no nearer using the dread
weapon than they were before the
intervention of the .Chinese Reds
forced United Nations forces into
headlong retreat.
