# BULL SESSION

### AL BERRY 
Another nostalgic, sentimental, slightly gooey fare
v < II column from a graduating Bull Sossionist. Bear
y/ith me. kids, it's my last.
That first year in Encina . . . the water-bags . . .
that last bloody pajamarino ... no football wins , . .

tl ii- unbelievable heart-choking
t-[jiiit of the winless Card rooting
section. The awesomenes of sit—
tint' in my Encina room and look
ing out the window at the Hoover
Tower iind realizing again and
again that I was at Stanford.
'1 hen fraternity life. The vivid
sensation of life on the Row —be-
fore I discovered it was in style to

be casual. Looking out my window at the lush green
of the Knoll and the field surrounding it—marred
only by the little brown path that the Zetes have cut
through years of trespassing.
The football—a real live manager for two years.-
.'I lie warm glow of sophomoric pride when I thought
•hack to high school days and recalled how I won
"dered what the "big time" football players at Stan
ford were like.
And then the wonderful realization that some of
thein were my friends. The sheer, breath-taking
beauty of the trees around the practice field at sunset
— signt that only a manager has time to appreciate.
'[he 1948 Big Game, and the ghastly, sickening l'eel
iiis> when Rock got hurt, and the absolute, unreason
able fury when Davy Field, 148 pounds of sheer guts,
robbed out of the winning touchdown. It was
wcrte than the '47 loss. The USC game in 1949. show
fha that teams can win on courage and desire and a
blocking fullback.
Winter quarter—any winter quarter—too many
parlies and not enough fun. Hut basketball. For
mats, nice things and no memories except the wet

and the cold and the wonderful realization that it I
will soon he spring.
Spring—the lake and the brown girls, looking very '
un-Stanfordish in one-piece bathing suits. The
Sweetheart Dance, and another gurl each year—three
of the best—the very best. Too much champagne,
baseball games in the hot sun. Track meets. Picnics,
pai ties, and balls. The beauty of the wtirm sunshine.
The pleasant blouses. The Cellar coffee time—after
four years the stuff doesn't taste bad, and the conver- I
sation gets better.
The senior year and the Girl. Then you forget about
the lake and the and the trees and see only '
the brown eyes. And wonder why you didn't notice !
things like that sooner.
The Daily. Oh. yes, the Daily. The never-ending
deadlines and the satisfaction that wells over yon
when you write something you think Is good. Even
though it really isn't very. The guys and gals of the
staff. So many of them. Yon can see them all swim- |
niing before your eyes—working, drinking, laugh
ing. Mostly laughing.
You remember Breier and Hall best. And before
that Farkas, Endsley, and Norton. It's good to remem
ber these people—and a dozen or so more.
The constant fights with Breier and the memory of
how he tried to knife you. Also the memory of how ;
you probably knifed him first. And the startling real
ization that you will have to go a long way to find a
better friend. Jawn Hall, good guy, is indelibly
sketched 011 the train. Dinah's and the Egg and the
Daily. "What did you learn at college, kid?"
You wonder how you can be expected to write
about four years of Stanford in iust one column, and
then you realize that you aren't expected to, and get
ready to hang it up.
Thanks for listening and '"Holy cow, let's have it
around the infield just one more time."
