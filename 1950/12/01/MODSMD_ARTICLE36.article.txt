# CAMPUS OPINION
## Red Menace Over Stanford! 
### 
To the Editor:
We the undersigned, after due discussion and con
siderable consideration, wish to offer our hearty con
gratulations to Mr. Donald E. Close for his insightful
analysis of "the Stanford Public Health Service, a so
cialized outfit." We are glad to see that there is at least
one enlightened man on the Stanford campus.
Wc should like, however, to call the attention of
Mr. Close—and all other red-l>looded American stu
dctits—that lurking in the shadows of Hoover Tower,
there are graver menaces to our well-being "sup
ported by equal contributions from every student re
gardless cif race, color, creed, or status, be they black
or white, Catholic, Protestant, or Christian Scien
list."
We, who have never had a fire, deplore the use of
our fathers' hard-ear-«>d capital for the maintenance
of the glittering RL.j fire engines. Furthermore, as
majors in Arabian metaphysics, we wish to protest the
use of out fathers' hard-earned capita by the pseudo
scientists (biologists, chemists, psychologists — you
I;now the type) who seem to be intent upon confusing
what all of us know to be true, for example, the su
periority of the Nordic race.
We could type all night pointing up such un-
American institutions as the Post Office, the schol
arship system, the campus police—yes, even the
Stanford Daily.
"II we are to be consistent in our opposition to com
munism, we should insist upon the discontinuance

of . . . (not only) . . . socialized medicine on the
Stanford campus" but of the University itself.
