# Health Service a Benefit
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I have had the opportunity of living under a system
of "Socialized Medicine" in Great Britain, and can
only say that I found the community far from being
communistically-minded. On the whole I believe that
a Public Health Service not only benefits those who
are unable to afford medical attention, but it also
serves to satisfy the "people" who might otherwise
seek a different governmental system.
A Health Service is a benefit that should be available
to all of us, regardless of religious beliefs or race. I do
not think that any truly religious person (no matter
what denomination) would deny healing to the sick.
My husband has lately undergone an operation
here, and the costs which we would not have been able
to pay for ourselves, were borne by the Stanford
Health Service. He found the Service efficient and
helpful and cannot remember having had to undergo
any undue red tape.
