WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 —Presi-
dent Truman today announced a
"rapid" buildup of the armed forces
and the atomic energy program to
defeat the Chinese Communists in
Korea and guard against the threat
of Red aggression elsewhere.
Congress immediately promised
swift action on the program, which
is expected to call for an increase
in the number of active Army di
visions. Such a program inevitably
would mean accelerated draft calls
and* probably would force a tighten
ing of Selective Service regulations.
