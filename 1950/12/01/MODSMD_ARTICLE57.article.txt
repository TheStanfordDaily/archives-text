### DEAN MATUCHA 
"The personal relations in my life have meant more to me than
anything else. ... A belief in a personal being or force behind
the reality of the universe has made my life more meaningful."
Canon Bryan Green of Birmingham, England, speaking before a
near-capacity audience in Cubberley Auditorium yesterday, af-

♦firmed his belief that, of the three
"insights of faith," atheism, agnos
ticism, and theism, theisfti is "to me
the most reasonable."
Green, in his talk on "Religion
and the Modern Mind," emphasized
that "every serious man must dedi
cate himself to what he believes is
the essential reality behind the uni
i verse."
"I am not a Communist," Green
said. "I loathe their theory of dia
lectical materialism. But I have the
utmost respect for my Communist
friends . . . because they are so
utterly dedicated to what they be
lieve."
Speaking with a cultured English
| accent, Green informed his audi
j ence, I have no use for a Christian
who has no reasons. I would not
advise any man to become a Chris
tian lightly. The Christian insight
ol faith carries with it the greatest
: moral responsibility of all faiths.
. Christians must dedicate their
lives to goodness."
Green stated that people must
! "place themselves in categories."
| "We all have the same data about
the ultimate reality," he said. "We
I all perform an act of faith when we
j decide whether or not there is a
i personal being behind the universe.
I Atheistic beliefs are based on faith,
not on fact, as some claim."
Concluding ironically, Green said.
"Some atheists seem not to want
anyone else to become atheists. I
j can't think why."
