### DIGGER ODELL 
Time staggers on!
The 1950 football season is now in the record books, and we feel that the
few billion words written about it will suffice, so without further howdydo
we now turn indoors for a look-see at basketball.
People already are asking about Stanford's chances on the court this
year, and after perusing the situation, we are now prepared to expound
on what the Cards will do during the coining season.
Since football is still fresh in your minds, we'll start by comparing the
Indian cagers to the Indian gridders, because, interestingly enough, we find
the same—shall we say, problems.
Like football, the cagers play two of the top teams in the country this
year. We refer to San Jose State and Bradley, rated by many experts as
among the top 10 in the nation. The Spartan game will be played in the
local Pavilion next Tuesday, while Bradley will play us on Feb. .'5 in the
Cow Palace in San Francisco.
Also like football, the Redskin hoopsters will be one of the fastest quin
tets on the Coast this season, if not the fastest, but, again like the pig
skinners, Coach Everett Dean's problem will be to develop the squad so
that the Cards will be deep enough to play it the speedy way.
To wind up our comparison with football, we have discovered that, as
usual, the sport magazines are backwards. Before football season they
picked Stanford and USC as the teams to heat (so they got beat!), and
now, before basketball season, the Stanford and UCLA cagers are picked
by many as the teams to beat (let's hope the comparison ends there).
The truth of the matter, however, is that Cal and USC will be the teams
to beat. Just goes to show you!
Well, we've already said that the Cards are going to have a faster break
offense this year than last year, in fact since before the war, but we're also
going to have a smaller team in regards to height. However, as Dean puts it,
"When you have little men, you play a little man's game," and that means
speed. If the boys are fast enough, it may easily offset the lack of height.
George Yardley, last year's Stanford Ail-American, is going to be missed
tremendously this season, but the time is not for reminiscing. We've got
some good men this year, many of whom were sophomores last year. How
ever, we're going to play it conservative for now and hold it down to "possi
bilities" until we have seen a few games.
We will say this, though, and it's dependent on a few "ifs." If the ball
handling is up to par with last year's performance; plus one season's expe
rience; if the team's speed is as fast as it's said to be; if Coach Dean can de
velop some depth in the squad so that substitutions can be made in a game
without affecting the play; and if the Cards can handle the backboards with
their lack of height, then the Indians will have a fairly successful season.
Just how successful, we can't say right now.
At any rate the Cardinal 1950-51 team is going to provide some interesting
tilts with their speed and cleverness.

tets on the Coast this season, if not the fastest, but, again like the pig
skinners, Coach Everett Dean's problem will be to develop the squad so
that the Cards will be deep enough to play it the speedy way.
To wind up our comparison with football, we have discovered that, as
usual, the sport magazines are backwards. Before football season they
picked Stanford and USC as the teams to heat (so they got beat!), and
now, before basketball season, the Stanford and UCLA cagers are picked
by many as the teams to beat (let's hope the comparison ends there).
The truth of the matter, however, is that Cal and USC will be the teams
to beat. Just goes to show you!
Well, we've already said that the Cards are going to have a faster break
offense this year than last year, in fact since before the war, but we're also
going to have a smaller team in regards to height. However, as Dean puts it,
"When you have little men, you play a little man's game," and that means
speed. If the boys are fast enough, it may easily offset the lack of height.
George Yardley, last year's Stanford Ail-American, is going to be missed
tremendously this season, but the time is not for reminiscing. We've got
some good men this year, many of whom were sophomores last year. How
ever, we're going to play it conservative for now and hold it down to "possi
bilities" until we have seen a few games.
We will say this, though, and it's dependent on a few "ifs." If the ball
handling is up to par with last year's performance; plus one season's expe
rience; if the team's speed is as fast as it's said to be; if Coach Dean can de
velop some depth in the squad so that substitutions can be made in a game
without affecting the play; and if the Cards can handle the backboards with
their lack of height, then the Indians will have a fairly successful season.
Just how successful, we can't say right now.
At any rate the Cardinal 1950-51 team is going to provide some interesting
tilts with their speed and cleverness.
Time staggers on!
The 1950 football season is now in the record books, and we feel that the
few billion words written about it will suffice, so without further howdydo
we now turn indoors for a look-see at basketball.
People already are asking about Stanford's chances on the court this
year, and after perusing the situation, we are now prepared to expound
on what the Cards will do during the coining season.
Since football is still fresh in your minds, we'll start by comparing the
Indian cagers to the Indian gridders, because, interestingly enough, we find
the same—shall we say, problems.
Like football, the cagers play two of the top teams in the country this
year. We refer to San Jose State and Bradley, rated by many experts as
among the top 10 in the nation. The Spartan game will be played in the
local Pavilion next Tuesday, while Bradley will play us on Feb. .'5 in the
Cow Palace in San Francisco.
Also like football, the Redskin hoopsters will be one of the fastest quin
tets on the Coast this season, if not the fastest, but, again like the pig
skinners, Coach Everett Dean's problem will be to develop the squad so
that the Cards will be deep enough to play it the speedy way.
