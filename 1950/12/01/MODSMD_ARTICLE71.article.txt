# Wilbur Tops Grid Pickers
## 
### 
Comes the end of the football sea
son and all the prognostics tors
gently take out their dirty hand
kerchiefs and gingerly wipe off the
gallons of sweat from their brows.
Ours are no exception, and it is
with a sigh of relief that they have
for the last time attempted to pre
dict the sometimes strange flight of
that errant oval known as a pigskin.
Final results, excluding the
Army-Navy game, show the scribes
coming in by a count of 245 to '238
over the professors.
Individual honors go to Dwight
Wilbur, whose 86 right and 37
wrong top the field. Second place
in the race goes to another scribe,
Bob Bernstein, who achieved that
honor by a strong finish and had a
season record of 83 right and 40
wrong, while behind him were
Professors A) Grommon, Mai El
ward, Richard Balch, and scribe Al
Berry in that order.
Although at first glance the rec
ord of the pickers might not seem
impressive, nearly all of the games
they had to choose the winning
team from might have been consid
ered as toss-ups.
