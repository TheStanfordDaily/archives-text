# Bennett Winner In Moot Tourney
## 
### 
Bob Bennett, third-year Law School student, emerged from the
semi-final rounds of the 1950-51 Stanford University Law School
Moot Court Competition yesterday with top honors.
Bennett and three other competing law students reached the
finals during two nights of hearings in which eight top-ranking

student lawyers argued a mock*
case involving a suit of search and j
seizure of private papers by fed- i
eral agents.
Sec6nd-place honors in the semi- j
finals, held before a panel of judges I
in the Moot Court room of the new
Law School Building, went to John !
McElrath. Lewis Butler and John
Ehrlichman tied for third place and
the remaining finalist positions.
The four will compete in the
Moot Court finals to be held during
winter quarter.
The competitors were judged on
their individual briefs, legal team
work, oral presentation, and on the
manner in which they answered
questions asked by the judges, who
represented the U.S. Court of Ap
peals.
On both nights, the court decided
that there was an unreasonable
search and seizure of papers by the
federal agents, but that the court
could not award civil damages for
the action.
