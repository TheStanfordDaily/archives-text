# Reason in China To Triumph--Hu
## 
### 
Reason will always triumph over political power. With these
words of a Chinese philosopher, written in the terroristic days of
the Ming Dynasty, Dr. Hu Shih summed up the "spirit of China's
fight for freedom."
Speaking to a large audience in Memorial Auditorium yesterday

afternoon, the Chinese statesman and
scholar traced the valiant struggle for
freedom during 3.000 years of re
corded Chinese history.
In the classical age of the early
centuries, creative thought blossomed
in the philosophies of Lao-Tsc, Con
fucius. and many others. This was at
a time of comparatively great polit
ical freedom.
But during the succeeding 21 cen
turies of the unified Empire, freedom
was very often under severe attack
by the government. Dr. Hu read a
"Memorial to the Burning of Books"
which he said could well have been
written by modern dictators.
In spite of the great persecutions
(for example, forced labor on the
frontier — very near Siberia) the
struggle was never stopped. And it
is to the great glory of the Chinese
people, said Dr. Hu,. that throughout
the centuries they have maintained
high standards of freedom of thought
and creation.
