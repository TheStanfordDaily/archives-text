## Chinese Reds Fight For Korean Capital 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 3 (UI»)
— The Eighth Army announced a
general withdrawal all along the
140 - mile front in Korea today as
Chinese Communists smashed to
within eight miles of Seoul behind a
shield of refugees.
United Press correspondent Rob
ert Vermillion, with the 25th Divi
sion northwest of Seoul, said a Brit
ish battalion counter-attacked and
retook some positions within eight
miles of the capital where a company
of Ulster Rifles was wiped out.
The Chinese were infiltrating UN
positions by mixing with the refu
gees and a high-ranking front-line
officer noted that they "are attack
ing Americans frontally for the first
time."
The grave new threat to Seoul
made the government decide to
evacuate the city, menaced by a
twin-pronged attack from the north
and northwest. The city itself was a
mad-house of panic-stricken South
Koreans fleeing toward the Han
River.
Correspondents at Eighth Army
headquarters said the situation along
the central and eastern end of the
old defense line along the 38th par
allel was possibly more serious than
that immediately above Seoul. The
Chinese and North Koreans were
swinging into position there to cre
ate a huge pincers around Seoul—
and trap UN forces there —or to
slash down into South Korea.
