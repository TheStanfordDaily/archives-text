# Marchie Is Top News Of Vacation
## 
### 
With the Big Game and Thanks
giving over, Stanford settled down
to a dull routine in finishing out the
old year last month. Yet, the year
ended Saturday with one of the big
gest stories of the half - year — the
resignation of Marchie Schwartz as
head coach.
Otherwise, the Christmas month
brought normal news items about
the activities of students and faculty
on their vacation. A touch of trag
edy prevailed as the fall quarter dre
drew to an end when an automobile
driven by law sudent Judge D. Fin
ley, 22, crashed into another in San
Jose Dec. 2, killing five persons and
sending Finlcy to the hospital with
serious injuries.
Killed were four Navy men from
MofTett Field, and Hilmar Oehlmann
Jr., 21-year-old law student, a pas
senger in Finley's car. Finley faces
manslaughter charges. He was re
leased on $10,000 bail.
An accident also took the life of
Stanford alumnus Alexander F.
"Sandy" Banks, 29, of San Gabriel.
Banks piloted a plane carrying three
merchant seamen to San Francisco
for the New Year. The craft crashed
into a salt pond cast of San Carlos
early Friday morning, killing all
four. Banks graduated in 1945. He
operated the Rosemead airport at
San Gabriel.
Time Features
A brighter note was the national
recognition given the Education De
partment's School Plant Planning
Department, when Time magazine
reviewed the work of Associate
Dean James D. MacConncll in his
"laboratory" of school construction
and equipment.
Time, in an article on the draft
headaches of college men Jan. 1, also
featured a statement by Men's
Counselor Richard L. Balch, saying
that the students arc suffering from
"draft neurosis."
The painting of "SJS" in yellow
paint on Hoover Tower caused a
flurry of letters between Stanford
and San Jose State as the cayc
I season opened. At San Jose, the stu
dent officers reprimanded the un
i known culprits and the incident was
( smoothed over with a word of warn
; inc, followed by good feelings on the
part of both schools.
