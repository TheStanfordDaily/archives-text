# UN 						and Korea

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 2 â€”
The United Nations' top committee
today was summoned to meet to
morrow morning as the United
States held "intensive consultations"
with other UN members on possible
new action to deal with the Chinese
Communist drive into South Korea.
The expectation here was that, at
a minimum, any new resolution
would formally brand Mao Tse
tung's government as an aggressor.
It may also call for a general UN
economic boycott of Communist
China and for diplomatic sanctions.
