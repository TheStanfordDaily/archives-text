# Farm's Civilian Defense Program Well Under Way
## 
### 
Stanford's own civilian defense program, which had its in
ception last September when Business Manager Alf Brandin sent
eight Stanfordites to a six-weeks course on the effects of a bomb
ing attack, moved one step closer to completion during the Christ
mas holiday.
Although university officials have practically ruled out the

possibility of an A-bomb dropping in
the immediate area, preliminary
plans for immediate action in the '
event of an airborne assault have
gone steadily ahead arid are now j
about half-way completed.
The farm's master Civil Defense j
plan calls for six separate units, each j
one commanded by a full time uni- |
versity employe.
The units include fire, police, med
ical, housing and feeding, public |
utilities, and control center. They j
will be commanded, respectively, by j
Fire Chief John J. Marston, Police
Chief Gordy Davis, Health Service
head Dr. George Houck. Director of
Housing Anastasia Doyle, Director of j
University dining halls Cristine j
Rieker, Superintendent of Buildings ;
and Grounds Carroll Blacker, and
Philip Duffy, University purchasing
agent.
Brandin Coordinates
Business Manager Brandin is the
overall Coordinator. Since comple
tion oV the master plan last month,
Brandin's division heads have been
busy lining up volunteers as well as
university employes to go to work in
the event of an emergency.
"We want each man to have a spe
cific job," Brandin said yesterday,
"so there will be no overlapping.
What we arc shooting for is a pro
gram which is as streamlined and
efficient as possible."
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds Blacker said work on an air
raid warning siren at the fire house
will begin sometime before the
week's end. Later, a "control center"
I will be set up at the same place, and
J will serve as a central nervous sys-
J tcm, informing the various depart-
I ment heads of impending attack and
; coordinating their activities in the
| field.
Few Students Used
Brandin said only as few students
as are absolutely necessary will be
used in the civilian defense work be
cause they arc liable to graduate or
j be drafted before an emergency oc-
I curs.
Once the individual units are fully
j organized, he said, each will hold a
I "dry run" to practice techniques and
! iron nut flaws. When these are com
| plcted, the entire corps will go into
j action in a full-scale mock attack.
Brandin said lie expected the de
i fensc program to he "ready to go" by
the end of Winter Quarter. He said
i the last-minute "dry runs" will not
entail a siren warnine. but will pred
' icate their action on a yellow, or
warning signal.

I will be set up at the same place, and
J will serve as a central nervous sys-
J tcm, informing the various depart-

Few Students Used
Brandin said only as few students
as are absolutely necessary will be
used in the civilian defense work be
cause they arc liable to graduate or
j be drafted before an emergency oc-
I curs.
Once the individual units are fully
j organized, he said, each will hold a
I "dry run" to practice techniques and
! iron nut flaws. When these are com
| plcted, the entire corps will go into
j action in a full-scale mock attack.
Brandin said lie expected the de
i fensc program to he "ready to go" by
the end of Winter Quarter. He said
i the last-minute "dry runs" will not
entail a siren warnine. but will pred
' icate their action on a yellow, or
warning signal.
Stanford's own civilian defense program, which had its in
ception last September when Business Manager Alf Brandin sent
eight Stanfordites to a six-weeks course on the effects of a bomb
ing attack, moved one step closer to completion during the Christ
mas holiday.
Although university officials have practically ruled out the

possibility of an A-bomb dropping in
the immediate area, preliminary
plans for immediate action in the '
event of an airborne assault have
gone steadily ahead arid are now j
about half-way completed.
The farm's master Civil Defense j
plan calls for six separate units, each j
one commanded by a full time uni- |
versity employe.
The units include fire, police, med
ical, housing and feeding, public |
utilities, and control center. They j
will be commanded, respectively, by j
Fire Chief John J. Marston, Police
Chief Gordy Davis, Health Service
head Dr. George Houck. Director of
Housing Anastasia Doyle, Director of j
University dining halls Cristine j
Rieker, Superintendent of Buildings ;
and Grounds Carroll Blacker, and
Philip Duffy, University purchasing
agent.
Brandin Coordinates
Business Manager Brandin is the
overall Coordinator. Since comple
tion oV the master plan last month,
Brandin's division heads have been
busy lining up volunteers as well as
university employes to go to work in
the event of an emergency.
"We want each man to have a spe
cific job," Brandin said yesterday,
"so there will be no overlapping.
What we arc shooting for is a pro
gram which is as streamlined and
efficient as possible."
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds Blacker said work on an air
raid warning siren at the fire house
will begin sometime before the
