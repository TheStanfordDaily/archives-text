# Coach Marchie Ends Football Career With Brilliant Victory
## Surprise Resignation Comes After West's 16-7 Triumph 
### 
The West's 16-7 win over the East in this year's Shrine classic
in San Francisco last Saturday was a triumphant victory for Stan
ford's Coach Marchie Schwartz, and it also appeared to be his last.
The Card mentor announced after the game that he had resigned
his post at Stanford to enter private business.
Schwartz's decision was made known several days before to

Athlctic Director A 1 Masters and'*'
President Sterling, but was not gen
erally publicized until after the pop
ular coach stepped into the locker
room and said, ' This was my last
job coaching a football team. I feel
like I have gone as far as I can go."
Stanford's Marchie could not have
ended his coaching carecr on a
sweeter note, for his well-coached
West squad literally blasted the
Easterners off the field. Television
announcers and numerous football
experts pointed out the quick open
ers and clever pass patterns con
coctcd by Schwartz for the West's
attack.
The 41-year-old coach, who has
held the top post at Stanford since
1945, said he had not decided on any
! particular kind of work but that he
will definitely stay in the San Fran
cisco Bay Area.
Potential Successors
Since Schwartz's resignation, stu
dents, alumni, and Stanford enthu
siasts in this area have been whis
pering the names of at least half a
dozen possible successors.
Among those mentioned were
Chuck Taylor, who coached three
undefeated Stanford freshman ms |
j before taking over as San Francisco
, '49er line coach this year; Clark
1 Shaughnessy, who led the Indians to
! the Rose Bowl in 1940 with the aid
of Schwartz, his backfield coach; and
I Frankie Albert, ace quarterback of
| the '49crs, who has helped tutor the
| current crop of qb's at Stanford.
Albert has told reporters he defi
nitely is not in the market for the
job.

Others Mentioned
Some observers have added Dud
DeGroot, head coach at New Mex
ico; Bernie Bierman, ex-Minnesota
coach; Jim Lawson, San Francisco
'49er backfield coach, who was to
be head coach in 1942 but who went
fnto the service before he got to han
dle the team; and Phil Bengtson,
present line coach.
Following rumors that Marchic's
entire staff might resign, Bengtson
said, "I would like to take the chance
that Marchic's successor will re
tain me as line coach."
A 1 Masters, approached by news
men in Piisadcna, denied rumors
that he might also resign as athletic
director. He said he was surprised
to hear of Schwartz's resignation.
Over a week ago the coach was be
lieved to have accepted his new five
year contract which caused so much
| controversy last quarter.
Not Available
Dr. Sterling, Schwartz, and Mas
ters were all out of town yesterday
! and could not be reached for statc-
I mcnts. The latter two attended the
| Rose Bowl game.
Stanford's coach said after the
Shrine game that he would "take a
i couple of weeks off and then start
! looking for a job." Although he has
a law degree from Notre Dame, he
j lias indicated he would not practice
I law.
Masters will attend the Pacific
Coast Conference meetings in South
ern California this week and will
represent Stanford at the NCAA
. meeting in Dallas, Tex., next week.
Those closest to the scene did not
expect the Athletic Board to con
sider applicants for the job of head
coach until after Masters' return,
! However, some reporters anticipate
I conferences between Masters and
various eligible coaches at the NCAA
sessions.
Also in the market for a new head
i coach is Southern California, which
very unceremoniously ushered Jefi
Cravath out of the coaching slot just
before Christmas. Top coaching po
j sit ions at Minncosta, Texas, and
I Ohio State arc also open.
