# Stores Warned Of Bad Checks
## 
### 
Stanford authorities have warned
local merchants that bad checks
have been passed in several Palo
Alto stores by individuals represent
ing themselves, apparently falsely,
as Stanford students.
In one case a young man presented
a registration card as identification,
but it turned out later to have been
a card which had been stolen and
which, in fact, was out of date at the
time.
In two other instances the indi
viduals were not asked for identifi
cation by flic merchants.
The local incidents seem to be
part of a national pattern in which
bad check operators seek to pass
themselves ofT as university stu
dents in college towns, it was point
ed out by Chief Counselor for Men
Richard L. Buleh.
