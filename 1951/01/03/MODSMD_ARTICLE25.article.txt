# A 						Resolution for All of Us
## 
### 
When the time comes to make a New Year's
resolution, we have often been stumped. For
ufter all, what's the use of concocting some res
olution which you know can't be swallowed in
its entire form.
This year there is a chance and a need for
everyone to make a resolution which can be
come a part of his everyday life —a pledge for
a philosophy of optimism.
This is the kind of resolution which wins vic
tories. It represents the late General Walker's
"We will retreat no more," President Roose
velt's "I shall walk again," and Monty Stat
ion's "I shall pitch again"—all rolled into one.
These resolutions were made silently or pub
licly by men who had every reason to resolve
themselves to deefat, but who instead looked
at the "sunny side of the street" where the dim
hope of victory beckoned.
Men and women in universities throughout
Ihe United States can shake their heads as news
of defeats in Korea, increased draft guotas, and
job shortages make headlines in the daily
newspapers.
They can consider their life in college as
merely a deferment, a fuse which will even
tually burn out and explode in the;r faces as
soon as school is dismissed.

Students may lose their incentive to pass
courses essential for professional training in
later life. An education may seem like merely
a chance to have that last bit of "party time"
before Uncle Sam drives his wedge into college
enrollment, shifting the ratio back to war-time
standards.
It is with much concern that we read H. A.
Overstreet's book, "The Mature Mind," which
condemns the American press for emphasizing
the black side of the news. However, this is
perhaps only a reflection of the American pub
lic's pessimistic outlook on a disturbing world
situation.
It may be not only the press, but also the
people, the students, the leaders, and the poli
ticians, who should move ahead with the phi
losophy of: "Real progress will come when
people expect and work for the good to come
rather than concentrating on repelling the bad."
If, on the other hand, students fall back in
anticipation of the worst, the inertia of a move
ment toward unhappiness and destruction is
increased, and defeat comes closer to reality.
Vague as this philosophy may seem, we see
it as a necessary resolution for all college men
and women who want to get the most out of
future lives.

hope of victory beckoned.
Men and women in universities throughout
Ihe United States can shake their heads as news
of defeats in Korea, increased draft guotas, and
job shortages make headlines in the daily
newspapers.
They can consider their life in college as
merely a deferment, a fuse which will even
tually burn out and explode in the;r faces as
soon as school is dismissed.

Students may lose their incentive to pass
courses essential for professional training in
later life. An education may seem like merely
a chance to have that last bit of "party time"
before Uncle Sam drives his wedge into college
enrollment, shifting the ratio back to war-time
standards.
It is with much concern that we read H. A.
Overstreet's book, "The Mature Mind," which
condemns the American press for emphasizing
the black side of the news. However, this is
perhaps only a reflection of the American pub
lic's pessimistic outlook on a disturbing world
situation.
It may be not only the press, but also the
people, the students, the leaders, and the poli
ticians, who should move ahead with the phi
losophy of: "Real progress will come when
people expect and work for the good to come
rather than concentrating on repelling the bad."
If, on the other hand, students fall back in
anticipation of the worst, the inertia of a move
ment toward unhappiness and destruction is
increased, and defeat comes closer to reality.
Vague as this philosophy may seem, we see
it as a necessary resolution for all college men
and women who want to get the most out of
future lives.
When the time comes to make a New Year's
resolution, we have often been stumped. For
ufter all, what's the use of concocting some res
olution which you know can't be swallowed in
its entire form.
This year there is a chance and a need for
everyone to make a resolution which can be
come a part of his everyday life —a pledge for
a philosophy of optimism.
This is the kind of resolution which wins vic
tories. It represents the late General Walker's
"We will retreat no more," President Roose
velt's "I shall walk again," and Monty Stat
ion's "I shall pitch again"—all rolled into one.
These resolutions were made silently or pub
licly by men who had every reason to resolve
themselves to deefat, but who instead looked
at the "sunny side of the street" where the dim
hope of victory beckoned.
