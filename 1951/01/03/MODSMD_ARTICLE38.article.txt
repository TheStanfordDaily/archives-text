Christmas turkey or the blight
lights of Madison Square Garden

a temporary one - point lead, but
Cornell came roaring back with two
buckets to ice the game.

breaker the following night to the
University of Pennsylvania, 59 to 58.

in the Cornell game, didn't play
against the Quakers. Ramstead led
the Card scorers with 19.

had a clean slate before making their"
Eastern trip. They defeated two in
tersectional foes in the Cow Palace

University, which put up a good
battle all the way. With the score
GO all and only a few seconds re
