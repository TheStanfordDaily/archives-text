### 
RIVERSIDE. Jan. 2 (UP)—The
Pacific Coast Conference and the Big
Ten said today they are "hopeful" of
coining to an agreement on a new
five-year deal to send their cham
pions to the Rose Bowl.
Officials said the only obstacles are I
the Big Ten's demands for more ■
Rose Bowl tickets and the West's de
mand to get the Midwest champion
in the Bowl every year.
"Our group already has gone on
record favoring renewal of the pact."
Commissioner Kenneth (Tug) Wil
son of the Big Ten said. "About the j
only objectiorf we have to the pres
ent contract is the allotment of tick
ets."
The Big Ten now gets 14.500 seats
out of 99.800. Wilson didn't say how
many more he wanted.
Vic Schmidt of the PCC said there
had been discussion of a proposal to
have the Big Ten send its champion
every year but no action had been j
taken. Under present rules, no Big j
Ten team may appear more than j
once in three years.
It was possible that they would
compromise on a rule allowing -
teams in either conference to appear
every other year.
"Both leagues are in favor of uni
form rules governing the teams go
ina to the Rose Bowl." Wilson said. I
