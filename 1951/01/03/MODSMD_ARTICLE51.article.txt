# Time-Tested Lloyd Style Still Makes good Comedy
## 
### ROY HEMMING 
When Chaplin's "City Lights" was revived at the Guild early ;
last quarter, there were many comments that '.'talkie" comedies
■| just didn't have the spirit and fun of the silent ones.
But Harold Lloyd—who used to make our parents roll in the
' aisles—has come out of retirement to show us how some of the

r ' classic slapstick situations of the old
■ days can be adapted to today's sound
. techniques.
So, you'll presently find Lloyd on
the screen of the Park Theater in

Menlo dangling
dangerously on a
skyscraper win
dow ledge, emit
ting the call of
the wild with his
> first drink, and
1 having a wild
• chase with a lion
on the loose.

It's all part of a collaboration be
tween Lloyd and Preston Sturges
j called "Mad Wednesday," which isn't
quite so mad as some of the other
farces these men have produced but
j which nonetheless has some of the
i funniest individual scenes since the
| last Marx Brothers revival,
j On the same program is a British
i dud called "Appointment with
Crime" which will provide the U.S.
i ; with a ready - made response the
j next time the English start blasting
j our gangster films.
