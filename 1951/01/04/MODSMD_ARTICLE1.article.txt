LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 3
(UP) â€” The United States declared
today it intends to "fight on in Ko
rea," but is ready to negotiate with
Peking "at an appropriate time."
American Delegate Warren R.
Austin told the United Nations'
main political committee that Com
munist China's drive across the 33th
parallel "compounds the original ag
gression" committed when its troops
crossed the Manchurian border into
Korea.
While carefully holding open the
door to negotiation "of an honorable
solution," Austin served notice that
the U.S. would push discussions with
other UN members on "what the
free world must do next" to deal
with the new Chinese offensive.
