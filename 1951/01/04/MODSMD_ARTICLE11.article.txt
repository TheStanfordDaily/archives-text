# Water Level Holds at Lag
## 
### 
The water level in Lagunita is be
ing kept at its present level, approx
imately 15 feet, by the Corporation ;
Yard to prevent heavy rains from !
overflowing the lake.
The lake reached its present level
on Dec. 15, according to Carrol L.
Blacker, superintendent of buildings
and grounds. The level is approxi
mately one foot from the top.
Blacker characterized the Christ- j
mas holidays as the Corporation I
Yard's busiest season. Though no
major projects were undertaken. '
workers weer kept busy with roof
repairs and interior paint work in
women's living groups.
All but a few of the pepper trees in
the Roblc Woods were cut down
when it was discovered they were j
sapping strength from the redwood j
trees there.
