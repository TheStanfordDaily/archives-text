TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 4.—(UP) ;
—United Nations troops streamed
southward from the doomed city of
Seoul today as U.S. warships and
transports massed off Korea's west j
coast for a possible allied sea with- 1
drawal.
The vanguard of the powerful
Chinese Communist army menaced i
the burning South Korean capital ;
from the north, and other Red forces I
were reported fighting as far as 40
miles south of the 38th Parallel some
40 miles west of Seoul.
A. U.S. Bth Army spokesman said |
the United Nations withdrawal from ;
Seoul proceeded "in an orderly man- i
ner, on schedule . . . according to a 1
prearranged plan."
Counterattacks
He said UN rearguards were still
north of the city, screening the with
drawal and launching limited coun- I
terattacks at some points.
The spokesman said fighting was |
"still in progress" on the central front I
but that the situation there was I
"vague."
United Press War Correspondent
William Burson reported later from
Bth Army headquarters that organ
ized fighting was raging eight to 18 ,
miles southeast and southwest of
Hongchon, a town 20 miles south of
the Parallel and 50 miles west-north
west of Seoul.
Censorship presumably prevented
more precise location of the fighting.
A strong enemy force southwest of i
Hongchon could cut in behind the
main allied army withdrawing below
Seoul.
Naval Task Force
The Bth Army briefing officer said :
that, as of 6 a.m. today (4 p.m. Wed- )
nesday EST), UN troops were with
drawing to prepared positions all
along the central and western fronts. !
"with some enemy action reported,
by friendly elements covering the
withdrawal."
Burson reported that a UN brigade I
counterattacked with tanks and in
fantry an unspecified distance north !
and northwest of Seoul, killing 200 |
Communists and capturing one Chi
nese and nine North Korean soldiers. |
A sizeable naval task force, headed
by the U.S. heavy cruiser Rochester,
was lying off the big port of Inchon
•—which serves Seoul—and navy
transports and chartered merchant
ships were massing off the west coast.
