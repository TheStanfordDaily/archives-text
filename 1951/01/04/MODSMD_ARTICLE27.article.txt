# The 						Unfilled Shoes

### 
Stanford has lost two men during the past
year who are unreplaceable. They are former
Dean of Students Lawrence A. Kimpton and
Head Football Coach Marchie Schwartz.
Both men might soon be forgotten were it not
for their personal qualities over and above nor
mal administrative and organizational ability.
These qualities make Coach Marchie and Dean
Kimpton unreplaceable.
With the resignation of Marchie, Stanford
finds itself in a precarious position. The loot
ball machine on the Farm could sputter or stop
should the large-scale draft make a dent in the
grid ranks.
To keep the football setup in running order,
Stanford's Athletic Board must obtain a coach
that comes near meeting the high standards of
Schwartz and also of Kimpton, who played a
prominent role in boosting athletics when he
served as dean.
Some have feared that with the end of the
Schwartz chapter of the Stanford story there
might be a definite trend away from "gentle
man coaching" to the machine-like organiza
tion cf Notre Dame, Army, and other perennial
grid giants.
However, we have not been swayed by such
a suggestion. Stanford has learned much from
Marchie Schwartz. The University has devel
oped a spirit all its own as the student body
stood side by side with each year's team—win

or lose.
In addition to spirit, Stanford has accepted
the theory that football is important, not solely
as a competitive sport in a commercial field, but
as a character-builder for the men who partici
pate.
That is why it is hard to replace men like Mar
chie Schwartz —men who have meant more to
the school than the average football tactician.
Everyone at Stanford can be proud of the
way a ticklish football situation was handled
here. We have only to look at Southern Cali
fornia, where a group of win-hungry alumni
with dollar bills as mouthpieces forced Coach
Jeff Cravath to resign. His team, like Stanford's,
was probably overranked and overpublicized
at the beginning of the season as the "toast of
the Coast."
However, on the local front, Stanford's coach
at the end of the season was riding on the crest
of a wave which had crashed in to shore undis
turbed by cross-currents from Army, Cal, and
a favored East team. Schwartz proved to him
self and to the football world that he is still one
of the top men in the field—both as a football
strategist and as a gentleman. •
His record as a public relations expert should
earn him equal prestige in the business world,
and perhaps he can sometime return to Stan
ford in another capacity to fill the shoes that
no one else can ever fill.
