# New Cashier's Office on Inner Quad

### 

"BIG MOVE" RESULTS - Above is the new cashier's office for student accounts, recently
moved from the Encina Lounge to the first floor of Building 1 to the left of the center arch
in the Inner Quad. It is expected that the new office will greatly facilitate student financial
transactions. Long lines filled the office yesterday as students paid fines before receiving
registration books.â€”Daily photo
