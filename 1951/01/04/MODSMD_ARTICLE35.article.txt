# Berlin University Fights Against Reds
## 
### ANN NORTON 
"Communism," said the earn
est gentleman behind the desk,
"has never been at such a low
ebb in Germany. The Free Uni
versity of Berlin was founded in
protest against Communist cen
sorship and control. It stands as
a fortress of free thought in the
divided country."
The.so were the words of Dr. Fritz
'I. Epstein, Curator of Central and
East European Collections in the
I louver Library, who returned re
cently Irom a spring and summer of
teaching at the German university.
The Free University of Berlin was
"adopted" by Stanford after (tie war
as the foreign group to which the
Farm would send donations of cloth
ing,. food, and books." Great grati
tude was expressed to Dr. Epstein by
; Indents and administration of the
University and the American Divis
ion officials for this help.
The students there are for the most
part studying in humanities and want
to become teachers or journalists.
Many teachers between 50 and (JO
years ol age were called back from
retirement and there is a great need
lor young teachers, according to Dr.
Epstein.
Majority Speak Russian
Wanting to finish school as quickly
as possible, the students do not take
time to have fun. "You cannot
imagine how hard they work," said
Dr. Epstein, "Thty are extremely

eager and industi ious."
Many are married, and the aver
age age is between 25 and 30. In a j
seminar on Russian History con- j
ducted by Dr. Epstein, 17 out of 21 j
could speak Russian because they I
had either been prisoners of war in j
Russia or had come from a school in j
the Soviet Zone where the students
are obliged to study the Russian j
language.
"Student self government." Dr. I
Epstein said, "has made strides in
German universities in the west,
especially the free universities." In |
fact, students are included on the
Board of Admissions. The board is |
made up of one representative of j
public opinion, one teacher, and one j
student who interview applicants and
made recommendations.

Founded two years ago, the uni- [
versity has grown to an enrollment
of from five to six thousand. More
than one-third of the students are j
from the Soviet Zone. The university
in the Russian sector, the old Uni- j
versity of Berlin, is under the au- I
thority of the Ministry of Education
of the Soviet Zone. Thyre the stu
dents are greatly handicapped if they j
are not of peasant stock. Children
of ministers, doctors, and other mem
bers of the middle or upper classes
are not likely to be accepted in the
old university.

I The students of the Free Uni
versity of Berlin work under many
J handicaps. As a result of the destruc
tion of libraries during the Nazi
j regime they find it difficult to get
j access to the books they need. Hous
j ing and health conditions are bad as a
result of the bombing. The first
dormitory, a women's residcyice, has
i just been built on the campus. Most
1 of the students live scattered through
the city and thus do not have a
centralized campus life.
I The Free University of Berlin is
in Dahlem, a suburb which is also
the scat of the American government
|in Berlin. The university receives
j strong material and moral backing
from the education division of the
office of the High Commissioner in
j Berlin.

j also included lectures at the uni
versities of Goettingen, and Kiel in
| the British Zone, and participation
i in the Amsterdam Conference on
World War II in the West. He was
in Europe from Apiil to September.
"There is still a great need among

Enrollment .'>.ooo or (>.OOO
Founded two years ago, the uni- [
versity has grown to an enrollment
of from five to six thousand. More
than one-third of the students are j
from the Soviet Zone. The university
in the Russian sector, the old Uni- j
versity of Berlin, is under the au- I
thority of the Ministry of Education
of the Soviet Zone. Thyre the stu
dents are greatly handicapped if they j
are not of peasant stock. Children
of ministers, doctors, and other mem
bers of the middle or upper classes
are not likely to be accepted in the
old university.

I The students of the Free Uni
versity of Berlin work under many
J handicaps. As a result of the destruc
tion of libraries during the Nazi
j regime they find it difficult to get
j access to the books they need. Hous
j ing and health conditions are bad as a
result of the bombing. The first
dormitory, a women's residcyice, has
i just been built on the campus. Most
1 of the students live scattered through
the city and thus do not have a
centralized campus life.
I The Free University of Berlin is
in Dahlem, a suburb which is also
the scat of the American government
|in Berlin. The university receives
j strong material and moral backing
from the education division of the
office of the High Commissioner in
j Berlin.
Part of Program
Dr. Epstein joined the faculty of
the university on an exchange pro
gram of the State Department, teach
! ing modern Russian history and ex-
J perienees between the two world
wars of the string of states between
the Baltic and Black Sea. His work
j also included lectures at the uni
versities of Goettingen, and Kiel in
| the British Zone, and participation
i in the Amsterdam Conference on
World War II in the West. He was
in Europe from Apiil to September.
"There is still a great need among
the Free University students for any
kind of wearing apparel or shoes," he
said, "and any further help which
may be given by Stanford students
will be deeply appreciated."
