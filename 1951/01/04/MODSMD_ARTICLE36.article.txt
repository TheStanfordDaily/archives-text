# MARCHIE
## Students Regret Departure 
### PETE GROTHE 
"Didja hefcr about Schwartz re
signing? It sure was a surprise,
wasftt it?"
Marchie Schwartz's sudden but
graceful bow-out seemed to be the
| main topic of conversation in yes
terday's elongated registration lines.
The general student attitude seemed
; to be a mixture of surprise and re
j gret.
Some termed it "a smart move,"
j and others, mostly seniors, were
happy about the resignation. No
one, however, put the blame for
Stanford's football misfortunes
; squarely on Schwartz's shoulders.
| 'those who favored his resignation
Â« did so for the sake of school spirit,
i One student summed it up by say
ing, "Maybe he is a good coach, but
I think that a coach should have the
| full support of the student body.
| School spirit is poor when student
opinion is split."
It is interesting that more upper
classmen favored the two-time All -
American's quitting than did lower
classmen. Their Rose Bowl hopes
| had been frustrated more times.
Quarterback Gary Kerkorian
summed up the team's reaction by
saying, "I think it was a shock to
all of us, and we are all sorry to
see him leave. Stanford is losing
a good man."
Most of the students thought that
i it was too bad that the ex-Notre
Dame fullback had to leave. They
| regretted that so much importance
| was placed on a won-lost record.
More girls pined over Marchie's
loss than boys. The women; less
| versed in football, put more stress on
I the looks of the debonair, dapper,
| well-mannered Schwartz.
There was one point, though,
with which no one could argue.
Ami that was that Schwartz had
the last laugh over his mid-season
critics. He ended the season in a
| virtual blast of glory, whipping
WSC, holding Army and Cal, and
coaching the West to a 'resound
ing victory over the favored East.
At the conclusion of the season,
his wolves were dead silent; and he
! left the coaching scene a bigger man
i than any one of his critics.
