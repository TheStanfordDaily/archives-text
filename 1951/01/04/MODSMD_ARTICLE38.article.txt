## Rose Bowl End Discussed By Heads of PCC 
### 
RIVERSIDE, Dec. 3 (UP)-The
possibility of abandoning the
annual Rose Bowl clash between
championship teams in favor of
an all-star game between play
ers from the Big Ten and the Pa
cific Coast Conference was dis
cussed here today by PCC rep
resentatives.
No official announcements ol the
discussion was forthcoming, but it was
understood that the NCAA meeting
in Dallas, Tex., next week, may level
a blast to eliminate all bowl games for
NCAA members. An all-star game
would get around that edict.
It was reported that many of the
coaches in both the PCC and the Big
Ten are opposed to bowl games and
that an all-star clash would get
around coach and team pressure ev-

ery fall. Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf, Cal
ifornia coach, has taken a terrific
blasting from Los Angeles writers for
Cal's loss to Michigan in the recent
Rose Bowl clash.
While all the meetings here were
"in secret," it also wa.' reported that,
if the Rose Bowl pact was renewed
with the Big Ten, it probably would
be substantially as it now stands.
The university presidents and fac
ulty representatives also discussed
plans today aimed at the curtailment
of alumni activities in the recruiting
of athletes.
Much of the work so far in the ses
sions has been aimed at lining up
proposals for future discussion at the
NCAA meet.
It is believed by some that a report
to be heard on the "bowl situation"
in the Dallas meeting may result in
curtailment for virtual elimination of
curtailment or virtual elimination of
"Many believed that post-season
bowl games are the major evil in
American football today," said a
school representative.
