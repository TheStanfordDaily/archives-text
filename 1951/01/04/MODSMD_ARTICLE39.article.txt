# PCC Bowl Action Independent of NCAA
## 
### 
RIVERSIDE, Jan. :i (UP)â€”The
Pacific Coast Conference's deci
sion possibly to withdraw from the
Rose Bowl has nothing to do with
any future actions the NCAA may
take. Professor Hugh C. Willett,
USC. NCAA president, said today.
Willett said that the PCC action
was completely independent and
could not possibly hinge on what
happens at the NCAA meeting in
Dallas next week.
President 11. P. Everest of the
PCC earlier announced that the
Conference would delav final ac
tion on whether to continue play
in the Rose Bowl until after the
NCAA meeting. That statement
gave rise to speculation that the
decision hinged on NCAA action.
