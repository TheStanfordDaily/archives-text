# Card Casaba Squad Preps For Bruins
## 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's 12-man cage squad planed in yesterday morning
from Salt Lake City to be faced with a huge registration line and
thoughts of the pair of tilts with the UCLA Bruins Friday and Sat
urday nights in the home Pavilion.
Tired from their long journey, the Cards held no formal practice

yesterday, but wul take to the court
today tor a strenuous workout in
preparation for the Bruin games.
UCLA, a dark horse in the
PCC race, has average 7(1 oints per
game thus far thi.s season, and is ex- J
pected to give the Indians a last race
for their money.
Led by Eddie Sheldrake, the only
returning first stringer, the Bruins
present a super-fast break designed
to wind their opponents as soon as
possible.
Early rising hours, constant travel,
and irregular meals accounted in part i
for the four defeats the Cards sufi
fered during their eastern trip over
the holidays. Ahead in the early min
utes of their games, the Indiana )
seemed to tire more and more as each i
game progressed.
Eddie Tucker, stellar forward for
the Farm cagers, injured his ankle in
the Cornell game and was unable to
play in the Penn game. Back in the
Utah tilt, Tucker scored 12 points
to lead his team. Ed will see a lot
of action in the UCLA games, al
though his ankle may not be ready
for top speed.
Those who made the trip east were:
centers; Jim Ramstead and Gary An
drews; forwards; Jack O'Sullivan,
Eddie Tucker, Paul Watson, Paul
Johnson, and Tom DeFou'r; guards; |
Jim Walsh, Bruce Iverson, Sid Hasler, j
George Goto, and George Zaninovich.
