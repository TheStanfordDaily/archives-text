bout at 2:48 ol the fourth when Be
shore's face was covered with blood
from a bad cut over his left e\ t*.
A crowd of 1:;.()% saw the stream
lined Louis, locking much like the
Brown Bomber of old, pound the
game but outclav-ed llurrisburtf,
Penn., younj' iter with stinging left
hooks and punishing rights through
out the bitterly battled four rounds.
The leaner and faster - puniehing
Brown Bomber, weighing a trim

| would stop the rough, tough Be
i shore in quick order, but he could
j not floor dead - game Freddie de
spite a number of solid blows.
