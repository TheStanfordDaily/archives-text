# Fraternities Anticipate More Pledges in 1951
## 
### 
More men will pledge fraternities at Stanford this year than in
any other year since World War 11, Dave Larimer, Interfraternity
Council president, predicted yesterday.
His statement came as a kickoff to the Farm's rushing program,
which will get into full swing next week with five nights of open

houses, beginning Monday. Before
j this quarter, no contact between
i fraternity men and freshman men i
was allowed, with the exception of !
I Christmas vacation.
Larimer said that fraternities will j
be anxious to fill their rosters to j
counteract the expected drain on j
membership caused by the draft.
Already, he pointed out, members of
i several houses have enlisted or have
been ealld into active service from
the reserves.
His words echoed those of Dean of
Students Donald Winbigler, who
warned last October that fraterni
ties may lose "up to three-fourths 1
of their members by next September Jit
| it draft legislation increases."
Larimer said, "Each house will |
probably try to pledge about 20 men. j
This is good from the standpoint of 1
the ireshmen.' He added, however, j
that houses do not usually get as
many pledges as they expect.
The open houses which begin
Monday will give Farm frosh men |
their first chance to inspect Stanford [
fraternity houses.
Under a new system, fraternities |
on the Upper Row will hold open
house Monday, Wednesday, and Fri
day from 7:15 to 9:15 p.m. Lower
Row fraternities will greet the frosh
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday at
| the same hours.
"The open houses are a prelimi- |
nary introduction to the whole fra- J
ternity set-up," the IFC president
explained. He said freshmen have a '
much better opportunity to examine I
and compare fraternities at the open
houses than they have later, during
formal rushing, when actvities arc ,
confined to individual houses.

He urged freshmen to visit every
fraternity during open houses. "It's
best to start out with a completely
open mind to the whole rushing set
up," he advised. "Don't feel tied to
any house before you have had a
chance to examine them all."
Formal rushing season, during
which unlimited social contact is
permitted, begins Friday, Jan. 12, at
9:15 p.m., and continues through
Monday, Jan. 22, at 6 p.m. Pledge
cards will be signed that night.
