## No Bombs Planned For Red China Yet 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. I (UP) -
President Truman said today the
United States has no present inten
tion of bombing Communist China
because it might bring on an all-out
war in A.sia which this country still
hopes to avoid.
Truman declined to comment on
the military situation in Korea. But
ho was emphatic in saying that U.S.
air forces will not attack Chinese
territory without a go-ahead from
the United Nations, and that he is
not considering asking the UN for
that permission.
His statement clashed head -on
with new demands from Republican
Congressmen that Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur be granted authority to
launch air attacks against the Chi
nese Communist enemy's homeland.
