# DRAFT
## Induction Age Limit May Rise 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP)—
Rep. Carl Vinson, D., Ga., said
today it is "fairly definite" the
draft will be extended to 27
months and disclosed that Con
gress may raise the top induc
tion age to 28 for single men and
childless husbands.
Vinson also said after a closed
dcor meeting that the House Armed
Services Committee is considering
lowering the draft age to 18 and will
make a "complete re-study" of men
who have been deferred for physical
reasons or to continue their educa
tion.
But he said he has advised the De
fense Department it will "get no
where" with Congress if it proposes
drafting World War II veterans.
Veterans now are deferred by law
and fathers by Presidential order,
but Congress could order a fathers'
draft.
Both Vinson and Draft Director
Lewis B. Hershey have said that
President Truman's goal of an
armed force of 3,500,000 men prob
ably will make it necessary to draft
18 - year - olds. They are now re
quired to register but arc not taken
into service until they are 19.
But Vinson's statement that his
committee is "considering" raising
the top induction age from 25 to 28
was the first indication that older
men may be needed. The Army has
asked for 240,000 draftees in the
January-February-March period.
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said
today that men called to military
service involuntarily — under the
draft, for example—should get little
if any pay because they are fulfilling
an obligation to the state.
He told a news conference that
men who undertake a military ca
reer should be paid "along profes
sional lines." But the government's
only concern for those who are sim
ply discharging their citizenship re
sponsibilites should be to take care
of dependents and disabilities, he
said. *
"You don't pay a person to go to
school," Eisenhower said. "You don't
pay a person to work out his poll
taxes. As far as I am concerned, it
is an obligation to the state."
Former Army Secretary Gordon
Gray recently expressed a similar
view. Advocating universal military
service, Gray said that youths in
ducted into uniform should be given
only "pocket money."

into service until they are 19.
But Vinson's statement that his
committee is "considering" raising
the top induction age from 25 to 28
was the first indication that older
men may be needed. The Army has
asked for 240,000 draftees in the
January-February-March period.
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said
today that men called to military
service involuntarily — under the
draft, for example—should get little
if any pay because they are fulfilling
an obligation to the state.
He told a news conference that
men who undertake a military ca
reer should be paid "along profes
sional lines." But the government's
only concern for those who are sim
ply discharging their citizenship re
sponsibilites should be to take care
of dependents and disabilities, he
said. *
"You don't pay a person to go to
school," Eisenhower said. "You don't
pay a person to work out his poll
taxes. As far as I am concerned, it
is an obligation to the state."
Former Army Secretary Gordon
Gray recently expressed a similar
view. Advocating universal military
service, Gray said that youths in
ducted into uniform should be given
only "pocket money."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP)—
Rep. Carl Vinson, D., Ga., said
today it is "fairly definite" the
draft will be extended to 27
months and disclosed that Con
gress may raise the top induc
tion age to 28 for single men and
childless husbands.
Vinson also said after a closed
dcor meeting that the House Armed
Services Committee is considering
lowering the draft age to 18 and will
make a "complete re-study" of men
who have been deferred for physical
reasons or to continue their educa
tion.
But he said he has advised the De
fense Department it will "get no
where" with Congress if it proposes
drafting World War II veterans.
Veterans now are deferred by law
and fathers by Presidential order,
but Congress could order a fathers'
draft.
Both Vinson and Draft Director
Lewis B. Hershey have said that
President Truman's goal of an
armed force of 3,500,000 men prob
ably will make it necessary to draft
18 - year - olds. They are now re
quired to register but arc not taken
into service until they are 19.
