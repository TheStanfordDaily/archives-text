# Bruins, Cards To Vie Tonight
## Cagers Open PCC Race in Pavilion; Frosh Meet Sequoia in Preliminary 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's low-flying Indians, riding on the crest of four straight
defeats, get a crack at the Pacific Coast Conference, Southern Di
vision champs, as they tackle the Bruins of UCLA tonight at 8 p.m.
in the local Pavilion. The preliminary game will feature the Stan
ford Frosh and Seguoia High School.
Hot off a plane from an eastern trip that netted them one win

against four losses, the Cards will
enter the game in good shape. For
ward Eddie Tucker, who injured his
ankle in the Cornell game, is still
taped up, but it is hoped that.he
will be at top speed against the
VVestwooders.
Big Jim Ramstcad will hold
down the pivot spot and in his
hands will rest Stanford's chances
of hall control under the hoards.
To date Ramstcad has hem out
standing in the cirrle with his fur
l-caching arms and high - flying
legs. In the scoring department,
Big Jim has scored over 10 points
in every game this season except
against I. tali, when lie scored
eight points.
Opening at one of the forward
posts will be Jack O'Sullivan, a
jump-shot artist whose speed more
than makes up for hia height —or
lack of height. He stands five feet
eight.
Enough has been said and written
about the other Card forward, Ed
die Tucker, to fill quite a few scrap
books, but none of it has been in
vain. A transfer from Compton JC
where he made JC All - American,
Eddie has been high point man in
four of the six games that he
has played under Stanford colors.
Standing a little over six feet, he
runs like a scared jackrabbit.
Jim Walsh and Bruce Ivcrscn
will start at the guard positions.
Thus far this season, Walsh has
been the sparkphi,? of the team
with his hard-charging, aggressive
play and sharp eve. Against Bay
lor in the Cow Palace over the hol
idays, Jim scored 20 points to be
come a member of the elite Cow
Palace "21 Club."
Although not as deadly in the
scoring column as Walsh, Iverscn
has proved his worth with his defen
sive ball hawking and his great team
play.
Coach John Wooden's Bruin cag
ers are currently averaging 7'.). A
points'per game, but, like the £ards,
have six wins out of ten starts in
prc-season play.
Leading the Uclans is forward
Dick Ridgway, sophomore flash who
has potted 146 points in 10 games for
a nifty 14.6 average. Close behind
Ridgway in the scoring column come
Jerry Norman, veteran forward, and
Don Johnson, Fullerton JC transfer
who has taken over for the departed
George Stanich at guard. Norman
is averaging 12.8 points a game
while Johnson has an 11.1 average
per contest.
Captain Eddie Sheldrake, the
only holdover from last year's first
string varsity and the ringleader
of Wooden's fast - breaking crew,
hasn't been shooting too much yet
but he still is averaging o.:{ points
a game. Gene Williams, ccntcr, is
next with a 6.3 average.
Although the Bruins rate them
j selves pretty low in the Conference,
they have looked potent in their
pre - season contests and figure to
give the Indians a tough, fast game.
Card Coach Everett Dean would say
only that "the team with the best
hitting percentage will win."
