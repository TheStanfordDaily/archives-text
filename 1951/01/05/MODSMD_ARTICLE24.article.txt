A grant of $41/180 in March of j
Dimes funds will enable Stanford |
University scientists in San Fran- I
cisco to chart the spread of damage ]
| produced in the body by the polio ]
virus.
This was announced jointly by
Basil O'Connor, president of the i
National Foundation for Infantile i
Paralysis, and Dr. Wallace Sterling,
i president of Stanford.
; Heading the work which has been
i carried on at Stanford's Medical
School in San Francisco since 1940
j with National Foundation support,
are Dr. John A. Anderson, professor
of pediatrics, and Dr. Harold K. Fa
ber, professor emeritus of pediatrics.
Under the terms of the new grant
I the Stanford scientists will trace the
detailed route of the virus through
the central nervous system—where
it docs its major damage—and its
path of exit from the body. Such
detailed knowledge of the virus's
I travel and the damage it produces
may provide scientists with a clue to
a defense against not only the infec
tion but also the paralytic disease it
I may produce.
Considerable evidence has already
been gathered by the scientists and
their associates to indicate that the
polio virus generally enters the body
from m"cous membrane surfaces by
way of the sensory nerves.
