vacation. "Log of the Yankee" will appear as an
editorial column feature.)
Al last a lifetime's wildest dream is being realized.
The brigantine Yankee has completed her first lap of
I id' trip around the globe, and I am one of the 23 for
tunate people to serve on her crew.
A year ago it hardly seemed possible that anyone

could live a life of nonchalance
amid Such excitement and adven
ture; yet here there is the normal
amount of griping, horseplay,
chiding, joking, and low moments
as in any walk of life.
Skipper Johnson, who has made
four voyages on 'the Yankee, has
aboard three experienced seamen
and a crew of apprentices, green

■us the waters of the Caribbean through which we will
tail.
Skipper and Exy, as a husband and wife team, in
• ure stability and cohesion on the voyage, for their
experience from previous cruises and their magnetic
personalities will guide us over any "shoal waters."
The rest of the crew you will meet as we .share the
"Log of the Yankee" together.
Nearly every youth aboard has special interests
which should add to the well-being of the entire com
pany as we sail from shore to shore. Among us are
interpreters, chefs, photographers, navigators, elec-

trical engineers, and WOMEN.
Taking dictation, sewing, sailmakiug, handling
lines and helping in the galley are just a few of Dot
tie Sclnneck's duties besides looking pleasing to the
eye. Then there's Julie I'yle, a quick-witted Smith
College grad. and Madelein Shipman. who has the
name, if not the ability to be an apprentice's first
mate.
Nor is age a limiting factor in our company for Ar
thur Johnson, 15-year-old son of the skipper, and his
buddy Ranny Duncan, were among the first to hustle
up the gangplank. Both can be found in the highest
and most inaccessible parts of the ship as they try to
elude the teacher-mother, Exy.
Promptly at 2 o'clock on the 29th (Oct.) the Yankee
cast ofi her last mooring line and began nosing her
way out ol Gloucester harbor amid a terrific din of
whistles, horns, and sirens from the many small boats
carrying hundreds of friends of the crew.
Most of us stood around the deck like so much dead
wood until the three motes led us to the right line or
halyard, since the rows of pintails meant nothing more
to us than just a tidy way of fastening ropes.
Although the sky was overcast, the first night was
calm and warm. We had been warned of the mis
erable experiences of a landlubber's first night at
sea.
Those who were destined to be seasick soon dis
covered their condition as they perched on the stools
beside the swinging table in the main cabin. There
were some like Doc who claimed they weren't sea
sick but were "kind of nervous watching that crazy
damned table."
And that was the first day out.
