### 
WASHINGTON — Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower said today he can de
fend Western Europe from Russian
attack if other Atlantic Pact nations
will "match" American sacrifices in
raising a unified military force un
der his command.
"I don't believe it is possible for
100,000,000 backward people to con
quer the great Western civilization,"'
said the five - star general, who
leaves for Paris Saturdav to take
over as supreme commander of Pact
forces.
Eisenhower's statement of confi
rlcnce in the success of his mission
was made as President Truman told
a news conference he does not need
Congressional permission to send
more America troops to Europe.
Truman's statement, in effect, re
jected Republican demands that he
consult Congress before going
through with the promised assign
ment of several U.S. divisions to Ei
senhower's unified command.
But Eisenhower's statements, at a
news conference and later at a Cap
itol Hill luncheon, fell in line with
another Congressional demand —
that the United States bring pres
sure on its Pact allies to do their
full share in the common defense
program.
