Oh, it's good to be back on the old Farm. Good old
Stanford! Good old LSJU! Good old deferment!
Please, nobody ask me how my vacation was. Only
guys with two'wives, a crippled grandmother, and six
or seven children can possibly enjoy vacations any

more. For young, healthy* unat
tached draftbait like myself
they're nothing but tense.
At least they're tense when
you've got a draft board like mine.
Selective Service Board Local No.
K8 does not understand vacations.
They seem to think that just be
cause I am home for a few weeks
that 1 am available to the organ-

ization they represent. This is obviously not true.
Uke I told them, I am home only for a short rest be
fore resuming my researches at Stanford University
researches which are absolutely essential to Amer
ica's war effort.

But they made idc go to their little "pre-induction"
party anyway. It was very depressing and I am suspi
cious because they refuse to deal with you unless you
are absolutely in the nude. Being at such an obvious
disadvantage, I had a very difficult time making them
understand.
Anyway, from now on I think I'll just pass up the
vacations. Sweating out that 1A classification showed
me very clearly just how much dear old Stanford
really means to me. They are very unpleasant people
at that drait board and I would just as soon not have
anything further to do with them, nude or otherwise.
Speaking of unpleasant people, Los Angeles had the
distinction of being the drunkest town on Christmas
Eve since V.J Night in San Francisco. The tipoff to
just how bad it gets down there comes from the Cath
olic Church, which has discontinued midnight Mass
all over the city because the drunks kept breaking up
the service. Nice town. Nice people.
