# Unscheduled Refueling Dents Students' Billfolds
## Las Vegas Gets Richer

News item—Slot machine man
ufacturers claim bankruptcy as
President Truman si,rns hill pro
hibiting interstate shipment of
slot machines.
When the pilot of a special Stan
ford-bound flight of HI students an
nounced that he was stopping at Los
Angeles to refuel, the passengers let
up a terrific howl. So they stopped
at Las Vegas.
When the flight got under way 35
minutes later, there was nothing but
grumbling. The souvenir and trinket
counter of the shop nearby was $16
richer, but the one-armed bandits
claimed more than $30.
Daily staff member Tom Peterson
reports that the net gain among the
group was 50 cents, won by one coed
who was smart enough to quit when
she was ahead. The rest couldn't
resist the temptation, and dumped
their winnings right back into the
slot.
The whir of the machines broke
the dull silence of the shop soon
after the plane landed at 10:30 p.m.
Tuesday. Minutes later, the dull
tinkle of silver was falling into the
trays on machines from the dollar
machine to the nickel bandit, only
to be fed back in.
Once the quarter machine poured

out $3.50, only to be fed back the
same amount. But the stingiest ma
chine was a small one that claimed
to be for the purpose of giving
changfc. It proved to be a one-way

bank, giving up nothing.
There were many bitter memo
ries of Black Tuesday in Las Vegas
when it came time to pay tuition the
next day.


AND GOOD RIDDANCE—A plane-load of Stanford students
who were cleaned out by Las Vegas slot machines at a stopover
on the way to the campus will be glad to see these one-armed
bandits walking the plank. Not so glad were the personnel of
Bay Area military establishments from which these machines
were removed on federal order. Sad to say, the Las Vegas ma
chines, full of Stanford coins, are still there.
