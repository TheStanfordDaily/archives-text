# Punts and Pitches

### PETE GROTHE 
By now the last battered helmet
and perspiration - drenched jersey
has been stored away; but football
talk is hotter than a Hoble girl who
lias been locked out for coming in
"lie second after 10:30. Thus, we feel
justified in adding a few post-mor
tems before 1930 football is put to
bed for good.
Naturally, the big talk is the sud
den resignation of Marchie Schwartz,
but reams of copy have already been
knocked out on that subject, so we
won't dwell on it. Most students
seem to think that Frankie Albert
and Chuck Taylor would make
a perfect coaching team. Clark
•Shuughnessy's name has also been
mentioned.
Wrong Colors
We witnessed the East-West game,
and congratulations go to Schwartz,
Kuss Pomeroy, and Bruce Van Al
.ityne, Stanford's representatives in
tht* Shrine tussle. It was Schwartz
who plotted the tricky offense which
beat the favored East. Marchie's
hefty opponent from across the bay
wasn't as successful in thwarting the
Eastern challenge.
Pomeroy and Van Alstyne turned
in excellent games for the West, al
though Southern Methodist's Kyle
Rote deservedly received the out
standing player award.
VV\* feel confident that one of our
boys might have copped the "most
valuable" award, were it not for the
color of their uniforms. Blue and
gold. Ugh! What made it worse was
that the gridballers from east of the
Mississippi were vested in red and
white suits.
The colors should have been re
versed. Our boys were naturally re
served about crashing full force into
a gridder with red and white rai
ment. Especially when they were
wearing the foreign blue and gold.
The colors inhibited them. They had
been .rained to do their best wear
ing different hues.
Don't get us mistaken. Van Al
styne and Pomeroy both played su
perb, workmanlike games. Only the
color of their uniforms prevented
them from grabbing the "most valu
able" title.
All-Opponent Jawbreaker Team
Nowadays, anyone who sits down
at a typewriter selects an All-Amer
ican or All - Everything team. It's
the fad. Not wanting to be out of
style, we have chosen a Stanford
All - Opponent Jawbreaker team.
The term "jawbreaker" means hard
to pronounce. The reciting of this
team is calculated to send professors
of speech and drama into uncontrol
lable spells of stuttering. Demosthe
nes would break under the strain,
find—Samuel Nirolopopulous (Or
egon State)

End— Monte Brethaucr (Orcein
State)
Tackle — Joe Cziginuth (Southern
California)
Tackle — Gerry Mosltofsky (Ore
gon State)
Guard— Donald Zaronski (Wash
ington State)
(iuard — Ted Hol/knecht (Wash
ington)
Center—Adolph L u 1> a in e r s k v

Quarter — Leo 11 a r d Napolitano
(Santa Clara)
Half — Jack Gihil isco (Oregon
State)
Hall — Arch ie Chagoniinii (San
Jose State)
Full—John Olszewski (California)
'ihi? award for the most musical
name goes to our own Joseph St.
Geme. As the Chronicle's Will Con
nolly put it, it's straight out of a
Kathleen Windsor novel. Though, of
course, Joe is a well-heeled boy and
wouldn't do the things that people
in Kathleen Windsor novels do.
The award for the most unearthly
name is Cosimo Cutri, a hard-run
ning halfback from Southern Cal.
The name Cosimo Cutri sounds like
he just dropped from Mars or a
comet or something. Against Stan
ford he ran hard enough to warrant
such a belief.
COACH DEPT.: Bill Leiser, in
yesterday's Chronicle, built a very
j.'ood case for Paul Brown as Stan
ford's next coach.
PREDICTION DEPT.: Watch for
liennie Oosterbaan, Michigan's Rose
Bowling coach, to quit.
CAR-SMASHER
Around Stanford, they make foot
ball players strong.
Jim Castagnoli, an All-Coast cen
ter last year and a coaching assistant
this season, was playing catch in
front ol the Phi Delt house. He ran

out for a long pass and came danger
ously close to a new convertible that
Was parked.
Gordy Rice, another grid center,
shouted, "Turn around!" But, alas,
it was too late. Cas went smashing
into the car. One arm went clean
through the top of the convertible;
the other arm rudely made its way
through the back window: and his
knee created a dent in the fender.
Cas, who went away chuckling,
received only a few cuts and bruises.
As we said, around Stanford, they
make football players strong.
