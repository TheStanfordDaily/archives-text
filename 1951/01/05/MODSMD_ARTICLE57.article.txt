# PCC May Cut Out Football Televising
## 
### 
RIVERSIDE, Jan. 4 (UP)—Tele
vision joined the Rose Bowl today
on the list of things the Pacific Coast
Conference may not want when the
1951 football season rolls around.
Still bristling after their stunning
announcement yesterday that the
PCC was "considering the modifica
tion or discontinuance" of Rose
Bowl play, the athletic directors and
faculty representatives took a whack
today at television.
"A survey shows that our attend
ance is down," said Commissioner
Victor O. Schmidt, "and television
may be the answer."
The organization that televised 30
games last season for UCLA, Stan
ford, USC, California, and Washing
ton admitted that it cost $50,000. of
which more than $300,000 went to
the colleges to make up gate deficits.
The contract called for the tele
vising firm (Hoffman Corp.) to make
up i.ny gate losses up to 20 per cent
below the anticipated revenue.
The biggest single loss was for the
Notre Dame-USC game, which cost
the company approximately $50,000.
Schmidt said 21 games fell below
the estimates of receipts guaranteed
by the agreement and in 13 of the 21,

the deficit resulted in uncompen
sated losses to the schools.
Schmidt said that probably no
other conference in the country per
mitted its football games to be tele
vised as extensively as did the PCC.
"According to a survey, the Far
Western area showed the highest
percentage loss in football attend
ance during the 1950 season," he
pointed out.
"The only two areas showing gains
were the Midwest, where the Big
Ten did not televise, and the South
west, in which the Southwest Con
ference televised sell - out games
only."
For the schools televising games,
the figures went like this:
California—Attendance down 11.1
per cent from 1949 and 14.0 per cent
from 1948, the year before television
started.
UCLA — Attendance down 20.5
per cent from 1949 and 49.3 per cent
from 1947, the year before television
started.
Washington — Attendance up 24.5
cent from 1949 (stadium enlarged).
USC—Attendance down 22.8 per
cent from 1949 and 37.9 per cent
down from 1947, the year before tel
evising started.
Stanford — Attendance clown 31.4
per cent from 1949.
