## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baskptbailers,
i rated by observers an outstanding
team, will no before public scrutiny
this evening in the 6:15 preliminary
| to the varsity till The opponent is
! a strong Sequoia Hit»h School team.
The yearlings have already
slaughtered their first two oppo
nents, and Coach Bob Burnett said,
[ "This is the best freshman basket
ball team since I came here in 1937."
Burnett will start Harold Ellis and
Don DeLong at forwards, Dave Ep
person at center, and Don Carlson
j and Oleg SuzdalefT at guards. The
j six-foot, six-inch Epperson has been
i the chief point-maker so far, tank
ing 17 points in one game.
Ellis is a good shot and smooth
floor man. The six-foot-two DeLong
has a remarkable physical asset in
j his unusually long forearms. It's the
same as two inches of added height
| and it allows DeLong to flick the ball
j out of an opponent's hand when he
' least suspects it. •
I The six - loot - four Carlson is a
' coach's dream. He is big, fast, and
strong, and has the body that a

coach of any .sport would want on an
athlete.
Suzdaleff is the playmaker of the
squad and is an excellent floor man.
This year's frosh squad is rich in
depth, and such players as center
Graham Grande, forwards Dennis
Dickson and Vincent Aliotti, and
! guard Tom Green will probably see
' action.
