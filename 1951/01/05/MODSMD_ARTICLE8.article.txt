### 
TOKYO, Friday, Jan. 5 (UP) â€”
United Nations troops abandoned
the big port city of Inchon on the
west coast of Korea today after
evacuating thousands of civilians
and wounded soldiers while naval
gunfire held approaching Commu
nist forces at bay.
Inchon was abandoned as Com
munist troops, moving southward to
cut off the main body of the with
drawing U.S. Eighth Army, engaged
in "heavy fighting" with UN troops
in the vicinity of Hongchon, 50 miles
east-northeast of Seoul.
An Eighth Army spokesman said
Hongchon, a key road center, still
was in Allied hands, but that Com
munist attacks continued in the area
and that heavy fighting was in prog
ress.
A pooled dispatch from Eighth
Army headquarters said American
units continued to fall back all along
the line to "predetermined posi
tions."
Communist units closing in on the
Korean west coast were reported at
burned-out Kimpo Airfield in bat
talion strength. It was the first time
since the evacuation of Seoul that
enemy troops were reported in
strength south of the Han River.
United Press correspondent Peter
Kalischer reported from Fifth Air
Force headquarters that F-80 jet
fighters strafed an estimated battal
ion of Communist troops at Kimpo
at 10 a.m. Friday.
The abandonment of Inchon was
completed shortly after midnight
Thursday. Harbor facilities were
blown up and all other useful instal
lations destroyed before the final UN
units pulled out. Communist forces
were expected to occupy the city
later today.
In central and cast central Korea,
UN patrols reported "two large
groups of Chinese" movine south
along the Chunchon-Scoul highway,
cieht miles south of Kapyong and 25
miles northeast of Seoul.
UN forces engaged enemy troops
as far south as 35 miles east-south
east of Chunchon and 45 miles below
the :18th parallel.
The situation on the east coast was
reported "unchanged with no con
tact" following the limited UN with
| drawal disclosed yesterday.
An Air Force communique said
UN fighters and bombers inflicted
M5O casualties on Communist forces
during the past 24 hours, mostly by
strafing columns sighted along roads
leading into Seoul.
