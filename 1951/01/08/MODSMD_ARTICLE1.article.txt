# RUSHING OPEN HOUSES BEGIN TONIGHT
## Freshmen Will Visit Upper Row 
### 
Twelve of Stanford's 24 na
tional fraternities will open their
doors at 7:15 tonight to the men
of the class of '54, beginning a
full week of Row open houses.
Under »a system inaugurated this
year, half of the fraternities, consti
tuting the Upper Row, will hold open
houses tonight, Wednesday, and Fri
day from 7.15 to 9:15 p.m. Lower
Row houses will greet the frosh to
morrow night, Thursday, and Friday.
In line with Stanford's delayed
rushing program, this will be the first
chance for freshmen to visit frater
nity houses and have any social con
tact with fraternity men. However,
contact will he limited to the ooen
houses until 9:15 p.m. Friday, when
formal rushing season begins, to con
tinue through Jan. 22, when pledge

cards will be signed. Men may pledge
at any time afterwards.
Sport Clothes or Suits
Row open houses consist of some
refreshments and a chance to inspect
the fraternities and fraternity life in
general. Freshmen may wear sport I
clothes or suits.
Dave Larimer, Interfraternity 1
Council president, in pointing out
that fraternities will be endeavoring j
to pledge more men this year than in |
any other year since World War 11, j
advised the frosh not to be discour- I
aged by the present national emer
gency and its resultant confusion, and j
to go ahead with their fraternity
plans on the assumption that every
thing won't fold up.
Larimer went on to offer sugges
tions to freshmen touring the frater- j
nities during the week:
"1. Be as natural as you can.
"2. Don't hesitate to ask questions |
about the house, as to its manage- j
ment. house bills, etc.
"3. Visit as many houses and talk J
to as many men in each house as pos- ;
sible; don't just stick with one or two
men."
Sophomore Pledges
The Interfraternity Council presi
dent stated that many houses will be j
seeking sophomore pledges to move i
in right away and take the place of j
men who have left school to enlist in j
the Armed Forces. He also urged j
freshmen who don't intend to pledge |
a fraternity to attend this week's 1
open houses regardless, if only to see!
what fraternities arc like.

Alpha Delta Phi. Alpha Tau Ome
ga. Delta Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon.
