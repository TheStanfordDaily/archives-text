# Athletic Board Refuses Crew Financial Help
## Budget Picture 'Gloomy' 
### 
Stanford Crew's request for
formal recognition in the form of
$5000 support from the Stanford
Athletic Board was refused by
the nine-man board at its Janu
ary meeting here Saturday
morning.
The Board's decision came after a
three months' discussion and investi
gation which included a personal ap
pearance by various members of the
Crew Association at an earlier meet
ing of the SAB.
Although the council was sympa
thetic with the "orphan crew's" re
quests, the board members had only
to turn to the Athletic Department';
overstrained pocketbook to come up
with an answer.
Finances Determine
General consensus of opinion was
expressed by the Board's statement:
"Because of financial inability to
handle the crew, we will have to turn
down the crew's request."
The group considered the effect the
additional $5000 expenditure might
have on the year's $524,800 budget.
All board members agreed that to cut
into the budgets of other sports or
into gift funds of the University
"would be disastrous."
Crew representatives had pre
viously told the Board the spoil
would need a budget of from $15,00')
to $17,000 to carry on a complete
schedule.
Gloomy Picture
The crew proposal was closely tied
in with the financial picture de
scribed by Athletic Director A 1 Mas
ters as "gloomy."
In his report to the Athletic Board,
Masters said football expenditures
have already jumped $5000 above
budget expectations.
Of the gate receipts computed as of
this weekend, only two games, the
Washington and Army contests,
brought in more money than was ex
pected on the budget. The UCLA
and California gates have not been
compiled yet, but may be slightly
above the budget estimates, Masters
indicated.
Not All Budgeted
The athletic director said the foot
ball budget will be even further off
when spring football expenses begin.
In addition, no allowances have
been budgeted for team representa
tion at NCAA playoffs or meets thr,
spring. Additional funds might have
to- be allocated for such competition
in swimming, golf, tennis, track, and
baseball, Masters emphasized to the
Board.
The building committee oi' the SAB
had previously reported the necessity
of painting the gym and shower
rooms. No place has been found for
this item on the budget as yet, •
though the committee said il i:. a
"must"' on the repair list.
Painting Stadium
Summer quarter, the Stadium ha ;
to be painted—placing an additional
burden on the athletic funds it was
also pointed out.
Final consideration on the Boarc';
agenda, and most important, to nif.l
observers, was the vacancy in the
head football coach's position. There
was general discussion of a number
of possible candidates, none of whom
were revealed.
The Board indicated further study
