# Why No Crew Money?
## 
### 
The Stanford Athletic Board turned down the
crew's request for 55.000 Saturday morning.
With expectations of operating "in the red" for
another year, the SAB could in no wise justify
giving less than one-hundredth of its $525,000
annual budget money to the oarsmen.
In the light of present conditions, the SAB's
decision was probably a wise one. Reports
from the inner circle say that board members
were at least sympathetic with the crew's un
predictable financial picture. But football, be
cause it supports Stanford's athletic program
almost entirely, will continue to hold budget
priority and take the lion's share of available
funds.
For another year, the crew Will have to de
pend upon its generous alurnni benefactors,
students, and others who have shown an inter
est in putting Stanford's shells on the nation's
sports pages.
For another year, crew members, managers,
coaches, and students in the Crew Auxiliary
will donate their time and energies to raise
enough ready cash to send the crew to Wash
ington (for their first dual meet with that uni
versity), Southern California, and, finally, Mari
etta.
But with it all, even if the hard-pressed oars
men collect as much as they did last year (ap
proximately $5,000), they will probably not
have enough outside aid.
Crew members will still be paying for their
own transportation on some trips, their own
away - from - home living expenses, and may
well lack the money to develop a seven-shell
outfit by the season's mid-point.
It is not our purpose to condemn the SAB for
its decision to refuse once again an appropria
tion which it has never seen fit to budget. We

assume that Board members, because they real
ize the value of the crew to Stanford's athletic
prestige, have examined every budget item in
an effort to trim here and there and give the
crew at least a modicum of official help. For,
in a monetary comparison with football, the
crew needs very little in the financial way to
put itself over the top.
What we do look for, however, are the basic
causes that underlie such an action. If college
football is ever to return to a strict, character
building basis, and if competition of a profes
sional character will ever cease to force insti- j
tutions of learning to spend large sums of
money subsidizing top-flight football players,
then such "minor" sports as crew may have a
real chance.
This is not to say that Stanford "buys" its
players. Dr. Sterling himself has flatly denied
any such accusation. But we do know that most
of the Buck of the Month Club money, for in
stance, goes for football scholarships, equip
ment ,etc. In the final analysis, w6 would like
to think of our alums and friends, who contrib
ute these funds, as contributors to the whole
athletic program —not just the football part.
If we want character-building sports that give
as many students as desire it a chance to better
themselves physically and morally—then we
know of no better sport than crew. In short, we
would like to see the Farm's 50 or 60 crew
members have the same kind of organizational
advantages that their brothers on the gridiron
enjoy.
Until the Pacific Coast Conference's athletic
departments, coaches, alumni, and friends see
athletics in this light—and so long as Stanford
remains a private institution without the bVaces
of state aid —we see no real hope for such
"unprofitable" institutions as the crew—R. R.

giving less than one-hundredth of its $525,000
annual budget money to the oarsmen.
In the light of present conditions, the SAB's
decision was probably a wise one. Reports
from the inner circle say that board members
were at least sympathetic with the crew's un
predictable financial picture. But football, be
cause it supports Stanford's athletic program
almost entirely, will continue to hold budget
priority and take the lion's share of available
funds.
For another year, the crew Will have to de
pend upon its generous alurnni benefactors,
students, and others who have shown an inter
est in putting Stanford's shells on the nation's
sports pages.
For another year, crew members, managers,
coaches, and students in the Crew Auxiliary
will donate their time and energies to raise
enough ready cash to send the crew to Wash
ington (for their first dual meet with that uni
versity), Southern California, and, finally, Mari
etta.
But with it all, even if the hard-pressed oars
men collect as much as they did last year (ap
proximately $5,000), they will probably not
have enough outside aid.
Crew members will still be paying for their
own transportation on some trips, their own
away - from - home living expenses, and may
well lack the money to develop a seven-shell
outfit by the season's mid-point.
It is not our purpose to condemn the SAB for
its decision to refuse once again an appropria
tion which it has never seen fit to budget. We

assume that Board members, because they real
ize the value of the crew to Stanford's athletic
prestige, have examined every budget item in
an effort to trim here and there and give the
crew at least a modicum of official help. For,
in a monetary comparison with football, the
crew needs very little in the financial way to
put itself over the top.
What we do look for, however, are the basic
causes that underlie such an action. If college
football is ever to return to a strict, character
building basis, and if competition of a profes
sional character will ever cease to force insti- j
tutions of learning to spend large sums of
money subsidizing top-flight football players,
then such "minor" sports as crew may have a
real chance.
This is not to say that Stanford "buys" its
players. Dr. Sterling himself has flatly denied
any such accusation. But we do know that most
of the Buck of the Month Club money, for in
stance, goes for football scholarships, equip
ment ,etc. In the final analysis, w6 would like
to think of our alums and friends, who contrib
ute these funds, as contributors to the whole
athletic program —not just the football part.
If we want character-building sports that give
as many students as desire it a chance to better
themselves physically and morally—then we
know of no better sport than crew. In short, we
would like to see the Farm's 50 or 60 crew
members have the same kind of organizational
advantages that their brothers on the gridiron
enjoy.
Until the Pacific Coast Conference's athletic
departments, coaches, alumni, and friends see
athletics in this light—and so long as Stanford
remains a private institution without the bVaces
of state aid —we see no real hope for such
"unprofitable" institutions as the crew—R. R.
The Stanford Athletic Board turned down the
crew's request for 55.000 Saturday morning.
With expectations of operating "in the red" for
another year, the SAB could in no wise justify
giving less than one-hundredth of its $525,000
