# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
I am waiting very anxiously for the day when my
little son decides what he wants to be when he grows
up. 01 course, if I had a son, I'd be waiting very anx
iously for the trial. But someday I will have a little
.-on. and I know the time will come when he'll sav,

"Daddy, you know what I want to
be when I get out of the Army?"
And I'll set him on my knee and
gaze at him tenderly and say,
"What, son?" And if he answers
brightly "a G-Man" or a "fire
man" or "a garbage man," I'll pat
him tenderly, take back the wallet
he's lifted out of my breast pocket,
and buy him a new Hopalong
Cassidy outfit.

But if he tell.s me he wants to be either football coach
or a basketball referee I know I will tenderly beat him
to death on the spot, without the slightest hesitation.
I'm sure if Lloyd Leith's father were in the stands Fri
day or Saturday he wished he'd gone in for a
little mercy killing some time ago.
As far as I know, the only person in history (with
the possible exception of a certain Missouri music
lover) who has had as much abuse heaped upon him
as Lloyd Leith, is Eleanor Roosevelt. Which reminds
me I'u better make certain also that my little.son
doesn t have his heart set on becoming the wife of a
President.
But while football poaches d<#h't get theirs at quite
doesnt have his heart set on becoming the wife of a
to lake mu t be even harder to swallow. Since men
like Pegltr made slander a profession, people in this

country have gotten very used to constant and indis
eliminate vilification of public personalities. Maybe
that's why the coaching business has become the farce
it is today. Or have you noticed the Chronicle now i
runs a daily form chart on the race for coaching jobs j
just as they do for Santa Anita?
The sad thing is that it had to happen here. Person- j
ally, I'm glad that Marchie quit. I'm glad for Marchie, |
not for Stanford. I'd hate to see as fine a man as he is j
go 011 taking the kind of abuse that they dish out for j
the football coach who doesn't win 'em all.
I don't know how good a coach Marchie was. I never j
played for him, and I'm frank to admit I don't know j
enough about the game to tell from the stands. I do i
know that he was admired and respected by many 1
members of his own profession. And I have had a !
great many people who do know something about the
game, including many of his players, tell me that those
who blamed him so heavily for our losses didn't know
what they were talking about.
The point is that Marchie was the kind of a man
you just couldn't help feeling it was an honor to know.
So here's where I go on record as a complete square.
Because I don't think all the Conference Champion
ships and Rose Bowl games for the next hundred years
are worth the price of the reputation and pride and
self respect of a man like that.
For my dough, and there isn't much of it, college
football has had it anyway . . . pretty soon people
are going to discover what a colossal bore it has be
come.
I've said it, and I'm glad. So, take it away, red hots.
You bore me, too.
