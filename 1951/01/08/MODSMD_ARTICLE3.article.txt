# Dean Squelches Press Rumors Of Unlimited University Draft
## Winbigler Clarifies Major Selective Service Proposals 
### GORDON ADDISON Editor, The Daily 
Weekend scuttlebutt of a possible all-out draft of college men
brought up scores of questions among Stanford students yester
day as they tried to figure out how they stand with their individual
draft boards.
Many of the worries generated by stories appearing in the San

Francisco papers arc unfounded, 1
Dean of Students Donald Winbigler |
said, as he tried to clarify the draft j
situation for men on campus.
ft is highly unlikely, he indi
cated, that such a drastic cancella
tion of collcgc deferments or 2-A
ratings will develop before June
unless the international situation
takes a definite turn for the worse.
Winbigler said first hearings on a
new draft bill in Congress will not
be heard by the Congressional com
mittees until Jan. 18. The various
draft proposals might be tossed (
around the committee room for a
month before a bill can be drawn up
and sent to the Senate and House for
debate, the Dean added.
Winbigler's statement threw cold I
water on a_ quotation by Martin
Poss, chairman of Board 57 in San ,
Mateo County. Poss's crystal - ball |
analysis, as printed in the San Fran- >
cisco Examiner, went like this:
"I wouldn't he surprised to see j
the ban on college •students lifted '
—the possibility is that it might
come in a day or so. But I want to
stress that we have had no direc
tive of changes, at this point, for
college students."
Much of the confusion in the draft
picture, Cbief Counselor for Men
Richard Balch said, has come about
because draft-eligible men between
19 and 25 years old know only one
side of the picture.
"They know just where they will
stand if they enlist," Balch said, "but
few understand what might happen j
if they stay in school without en- ;
listing."
He blamed the winter quarter rcg- |
istration drop on this misunder
standing among college men. Ap
proximately 200 to 300 Stanford men
enlisted during Christmas vacation
because they were not sure of what i
their military status might be when
school is dismissed.
Any male students who arc 19 and
have completed at least one academ
ic year, Balch said, are eligible for
and should apply for 2-A classifica
tion if they are in the upper half of
their respective classes. The class
averages for the last academic year
are as follows:
Class of '53 2.4.1
Class of '52 2.52
Class of '51 2. fit)
Class of '50 (grad.) 2.f>9
Men who are not sure of their j
status should contact Balch in his
office in Building 100.
Dean Winbigler and Balch, in an
alyzing the possible draft setup. |
which will be under study in Con- |
gress next week, pointed out three
proposed plans which have been
publicized by different national au- ,
thorities.
Most observers anticipate a com
promise among several plans, al- j
though the draft proposal as sum- I
marized bv Earl J. McGrath, U.S.
Commissioner of Education, has re
ceived strong backing in most cir
cles.
By his plan, approximately 100,000
of the top high-school graduates, se
lected on the basis of special tests. :
would be allowed to attend colleges
for specialized and advanced train
ing before being subjected to mili
tary duty. Other high-school stu- j
dents would be inducted after grad- |
uation.
Those selected for college training j
would be allowed to remain in col
lege the normal time required for
obtaining a degree. i
The McGrath proposal would
allow men already in colleges to
continue until graduation on (he
basis of some selection process
equivalent to that used on the
high-school graduates. An addi
tional feature would let seniors,
doing satisfactory work, complete
their year's work for a degree.
Although the machinery of such a
draft setup is not given in detail by
McGrath, many of its provisions im- j
ply that some selective method, such j
as the one drawn up by the Tritten j
commit lei would be used. This'

group has been serving Selective
Service Director Maj. Gen. Lewis B.
Hershey in an advisory capacity.
The committee, this summer, set
up a plan of "gradual attrition"
whereby men in the lower scholastic
brackets of each college class would
eventually be inducted.
Specifically, at the end of the
freshman year, men in the top 50
per cent of the class would be al
lowed to continue. Of those re
maining at the end of the sopho
more year, men in the upper two
thirds of the class could continue.
Of these, men in the upper 75 per
cent of the class at the end of the
junior year could continue. If the
registrant is enrolled in the first
year of a graduate school lie would
be allowed to continue if he is in
the upper half of his class.
This system of predictable attri
tion may be replaced by a setup in
which Gen. Hershey is given blan
ket power to establish the percent
age of men who can remain in col
lege. The draft head would base his
selective percentages on the basis of
shifting manpower demands which
fluctuate with the •international
emergency.
Another draft plan representing
the Association of American Uni
versities, and influenced largely by
Dr. James Conant, president of Har
vard, would require all men to go
into military service upon gradua
tion from high school unless a man
has extreme physical handicaps.
Those with some physical de
fects would he placed in a Defense
Service Corps; which would be
trained mainly for non - combat
jobs.
Conant's plan calls for an extend
ed 27 months' scrvicc. However, he
does leave room for a selected group
to undergo college training under
ROTC controls. Although these
men would get a college education,
they would have to serve two extra
years after completion of the ad
vanced course.
The latter draft proposal would
provide for men in college now to
be deferred or inducted according
to the Tryttcn committee's "gradual
attrition."
