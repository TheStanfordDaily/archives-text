Stanford's seven eating clubs will launch their informal rush
ing program Thursday evening at 7:30 in the main lobby of Toyon
Hall with their annual open house.
The first of two open house affairs planned by Interclub Council
for January, Thursday's event will give freshmen and other inter-

ested students a chance to meet
members of all ihe clubs and an op
portunity to decide whether they arc 1
interested in joining one of them.
Besides the opportunity to meet '
' members of the clubs, and inquire I
otout every facet of eating club life. |
freshmen interested in a further in
sight into eating club activities may :
J arrange to cat with any club they de-
I sire.
Le Kelson, president of Interclub
Council, states that trie clubs hope to
enroll between 75 and 100 new mem
bers this year to bring each group up
! to its full prewar strength averaging
iibout 40 members a club. 'Ihis is in
anticipation of plans to begin con
struction of a new building within
| the very near future.
Kelson also said that Interclub
Council was sending a letter to each
! Stanford freshman early this week.
| Among other advantages offered by
I an eating club, Kelson explains, "An
eating club offers the advantages of
| personal freedom combined with
enough informal organization to en
joy group functions such as social ac
tivities and sports."
"Scholastically, all of the eating
I clubs had higher grade averages last
year than the all-men's average, in
spite of social emphasis," says Kelson.

It is exactly 50 years since the first
eating club, Los Arcos, was formed
at Stanford. In 1912, Breakers, El
Campo, and El Toro built the "Little
Quad," a set of clubrooms and kitch
ens situated until the outbreak of
World War II where the Toyon park
ing lot by the tennis courts is now
located. Los Arcos, El Capitan, El
Cuadro, and El Tigre each had an
individual clubroom in Encina Com
mons.
