# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## On the road and in the laboratory, Du Pont scientists are writing The 						Inside Story of Engine Deposits 
### 
Engineers have long known that de
posits which accumulate in gasoline
engines have a direct bearing on en
gine performance. Even now, how
ever, no way has been found to elim
inate these deposits or their effects.
As a manufacturer of chemicals
used by the petroleum industry, the
Du Pont Company has a particular
interest in this problem. It is cur
rently the subject of a comprehensive
research project, conducted both on
the road and in the laboratory.
When Du Pont engineers began
their studies, some aspects of the re
lationships between engine, fuel, lu
bricant, operating conditions and de
posits were known. But to understand
how and why deposits form and to
develop corrective measures, they
needed additional information.
Engineers take to the road
To get these facts, Du Pont engi
neers are supervising tests in a fleet
of passenger cars and trucks that
travel hundreds of thousands of miles
yearly under carefully controlled con
ditions. The effects of deposits on
octane number requirement, valve
performance, spark plug condition
and other performance characteris
tics are measured. After each test,
the deposits are weighed and ex
amined physically and chemically.
In the laboratory, other engineers
study the effects of the same vari
ables on multicylinder engines. Ilere,
where closer control of (he engines is
possible, greater attention can be
paid to specific fuel or engine oper.it
ing effects. Performance factors, such
as power output, can Ik; more con
veniently measured.

A third group of Du Pont engineers
uses single cylinder engines in lab
oratory studies of deposit formation,
adhesion, removal and harm. Explor
ing new fields, these men had to de
sign complex instrumentation for
measuring factors such as surface
condition and deposit thickness.
Chemists synthesize deposits
Chemists, too, have an important
place in this research. They study
the chemical and physical character
isticsof en gi nil deposits. Amongother
things, they devise ways 0f synthe
sizing, in fired engines, deposits con
sisting almost entirely of a single
chemical compound in order to study
its effect on engine performance.
The results of this comprehensive
research program are not yet con
clusive, although the relationships
Ixjtween engine, fuel, lubricant, op
erating condition and deposit forma
tion and harm are much better un
derstood. In the past Du Pont scien
tists have licked even more difficult
problems. Working as a team, they
will persist in their effort to provide
the motorist with improved engine
performance through better fuels.
