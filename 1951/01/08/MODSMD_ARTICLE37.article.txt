UP FOR THE REBOUND —In a tangle of arms Stanford's two "big" men, Jim Ramstead (No. 10)
and Jim Walsh, are up off the floor in the midst of three UCLA cagers. Bruin center, Gene Wil
liams (No. 22), is waiting for the ball to come down. The G-ft. 4-in. height of Ramstead and Walsh
was a major factor in coping with the long reach of the Bruin team.
