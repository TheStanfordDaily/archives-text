# Indian Cagers Break Losing Streak With 74 to 71 Win Over Bruin Quint
## 
### EARL ODELL 
It was a great night for Stanford Saturday in the local Pavilion,
as the whizzing Cards broke a five-game losing streak to defeat
the UCLA Bruins, 74 to 71. The Indians had lost their fifth con
secutive game to the same outfit Friday night by a score of 78 to 73.
It looked like the fans were watching a tennis match, as they

snapped their necks back anil forth
trying to watch the two quints flash J
down the »the court. What appeared
lo be full speed for both teams in the
the first half, however, turned out to,
be a walk compared with the second;
period when the Indians exploded j
with lour quick buckets within the •
first two minutes to lengthen their |
37 to 33 halftime lead to 45 to 33.
The not-to-be-denied Westwood
ers, the fastest team to meet the
Cards thus fur this season, were far,
from through, though, and Jerry!
Norman, Bruin high scorer for the;
evening with 20 points, came roaring
back with the 35th point for UCLA.
A Nip and Tucker Battle
After thiit, it was nip and Tucker,
and truly it was an Eddie Tuckerj
show. Eddie was high-point man
with 20 points. Everywhere you
looked Eddie was there or had been j
there within the previous second.
UCLA never did catch on to his long
stride and quick change of pace, as !
Tucker raced down the court with a j
long bouncing step only lo zoom j
away when a Bruin approached.
After scoring 23 points in Friday
night's game and 14 points in the lust
half of Saturday's game, Dick Ridg- j
way, the highly touted, high-scoring ;
forward from the Southland, was j
held to it mere 5 points. From there j
on Jerry Norman and Don Johnson
carried the ball, so to speak, match- j
ing the Cards almost point for point. |
In the last minute of the game, the
Indians took control of the ball and

refused to relinquish it, even when
faced with a small free-for-all in
which Bobby Pounds, Negro forward
for the Bruins, entered the fray in the
last two minutes and almost fouled
out diving for the ball and whoever
was holding it.
Bruins Once
Only once were ti.e Bruins ahead
and that was in the first 30 seconds
when Jerry Norman dumped a
bucket for the first two points of tho
game. However, the Cards came right
back with a 25-foot shot by Bruce
Iversen, Indian guard, to tie the game
up at 2-ull with less than a minute
gone. The Cards followed with a foul
shot by Iversen and a one-handed
push shot by Tucker before the
Woodenmen scored again.
Four minutes out, Gene Williams,
UCLA center, dumped one in to tie
the game at 9 to 9, but it was broken
when Jim Ramstead jumped up for
what everyone thought was a long
shot by Iversen and for that matter

might actually have been, but Ram- ;
stead got it, jumped again and
dumped it to leave it at 11 to 9.
Once more halfway through the |
first period the score was tied, 18 to
18, with a shot by Bruin Dick Ridg
way, but it was quickly broken by a
foul shot by Iversen and a minute j
later Jim Walsh lengthened it to 21 I
