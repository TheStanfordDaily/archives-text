# Kisler Says Austrian Want Independence, UN Membership
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
"The Germans live to work;
the Austrians work to live."
This is the way Karl Kisler,
Austrian foreign scholarship
student now at Stanford, sums
up the difference between the
Germans and the people of his
own country.
Although culturally tied to Ger
many because the' same language is
spoken, Austiia has no desire to be
politically united with her neighbor.
In fact, Karl points out, Austrians
have more family ties with Czecho
slovakia, Italy, and Hungary as a
result of the old Austrian Empire.
Undaunted by four United Na
tions' refusals for admittance,
caused by the Russian veto,
Austria is still anxious to join the
UN, according to Karl.
Karl is past president of the Aca
demic Association for Foreign Pol
icy, a section of the major UN asso
ciation set up by the Austrian peo
ple. This organization prepares stu
dents for foreign diplomacy, inter
national commerce, and law in addi
tion to keeping the people informed
on UN activities.

One »if the believe-it-or-nots of
the Cold War is the International
Forum held by this organization
each winter. Here Russian politi
cal representatives of Eastern
states and representatives of
Western powers come together
and teach the student members
political and economic problems
of their respective countries. Ac
cording to Karl, this is the only
place in the world today where
this type of work is done.
Karl explained that his people
have great faith in the UN, but they
feel that the veto power exercised
by the great powers is an obstacle to
any concrete action. Like other Eu
ropean countries, Austria puts it this
way:
Austria, caught between East
and West, wants to re - establish
her independence through the
signing of the state treaty. Austria
is now occupied by four countries,
but her government is free to act,
advised by the four commission
ers. Karl feels Austria's vital lo
cation in the middle of Europe will
extend the occupation longer than
the people would like.
Because of her precarious loca
tion and position as a small nation,
Karl feels Austrians are much more

concerned with world events than !
Americans. He also offered the I
opinion that Austrian newspapers
are better read because they are
smaller and thinner so that people
have time to read them thoroughly.
Vienna, Karl claims, is almost as
gay as in pre-war days. The great
balls and music festivals have re
turned. At the Salzburg festival
Karl says he heard more people
speaking English, Swedish, and
French than the native Austrian
dialect.
Austria is now the cheapest coun- j
try for tourists, according to Karl.
A favorable rate of exchange and
terminaton of the black market have i
hiked the American dollar value.
As for American movies, Karl says
that Vienna was almost the only city j
where "The Third Man" was not a
success. The citizens of Vienna, lor I
cale of the picture, just couldn't see '
how an audience could listen to a j
zither throughout an entire movie, j
Milk — "the baby food," as he i
terms it—was a disappointment of- J
fered him by his fraternity mates at j
the Sigma Chi house. He would !
rather keep the situation as it is in |
Austria—milk for babies and (
for everyone else.

smaller and thinner so that people
have time to read them thoroughly.
Vienna, Karl claims, is almost as
gay as in pre-war days. The great
balls and music festivals have re
turned. At the Salzburg festival
Karl says he heard more people
speaking English, Swedish, and
French than the native Austrian
dialect.
Austria is now the cheapest coun- j
try for tourists, according to Karl.
A favorable rate of exchange and
terminaton of the black market have i
hiked the American dollar value.
As for American movies, Karl says
that Vienna was almost the only city j
where "The Third Man" was not a
success. The citizens of Vienna, lor I

how an audience could listen to a j
zither throughout an entire movie, j

for everyone else.
"The Germans live to work;
the Austrians work to live."
This is the way Karl Kisler,
Austrian foreign scholarship
student now at Stanford, sums
up the difference between the
Germans and the people of his
own country.
Although culturally tied to Ger
many because the' same language is
spoken, Austiia has no desire to be
politically united with her neighbor.
In fact, Karl points out, Austrians
have more family ties with Czecho
slovakia, Italy, and Hungary as a
result of the old Austrian Empire.
Undaunted by four United Na
tions' refusals for admittance,
caused by the Russian veto,
Austria is still anxious to join the
UN, according to Karl.
Karl is past president of the Aca
demic Association for Foreign Pol
icy, a section of the major UN asso
ciation set up by the Austrian peo
ple. This organization prepares stu
dents for foreign diplomacy, inter
national commerce, and law in addi
tion to keeping the people informed
on UN activities.

One »if the believe-it-or-nots of
the Cold War is the International
Forum held by this organization
each winter. Here Russian politi
cal representatives of Eastern
states and representatives of
Western powers come together
and teach the student members
political and economic problems
of their respective countries. Ac
cording to Karl, this is the only
place in the world today where
this type of work is done.
Karl explained that his people
have great faith in the UN, but they
feel that the veto power exercised
by the great powers is an obstacle to
any concrete action. Like other Eu
ropean countries, Austria puts it this
way:
Austria, caught between East
and West, wants to re - establish
her independence through the
signing of the state treaty. Austria
is now occupied by four countries,
but her government is free to act,
advised by the four commission
ers. Karl feels Austria's vital lo
cation in the middle of Europe will
extend the occupation longer than
the people would like.
Because of her precarious loca
tion and position as a small nation,
Karl feels Austrians are much more

concerned with world events than !
Americans. He also offered the I
opinion that Austrian newspapers
are better read because they are
smaller and thinner so that people
have time to read them thoroughly.
