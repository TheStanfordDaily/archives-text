## Deferments Essential 
### 
The prospect of unlimited drafting of college men was sug
gested and supported by several city newspapers and the Daily
Californian over the weekend as registrars in the Bay Area re
ported enrollment had dropped considerably and enlistments
were becoming more and more prevalent among college 1-A's.
The idea of stopping deferment of all college men corrects only
one condition—a manpower shortage. Although the President I
has called for 3'/2 million men by July, the public must not be
oblivious to the demands for educated men—scientists, mathema- j
ticians, and other specialized students who are even more crucial
to the nation's over-all effort.
A Long-Term Crisis
Were the present emergency likely to be merely a two-year
uprising, the nation could afford to force all men between 19 and
25 years of age into the service. Men could leave college and
return in a few years.
But Congressmen are thinking in terms of 10-year draft laws.
They don't anticipate a change in Russia's world-conquering
ideas.
Hence, men trained with a college education can not be thrown
into the conflict with complete abandon. There is a need for a
continuous flow of trained personnel in the future.
The Trytten Committee, which favors deferment of some col- j
lege students says, "Our nation is already suffering from a serious
shortage of scientific, professional, specialized personnel, and
leaders, resulting from constrictions applied during World War
II."
In addition to this, many men leaving college for the army
would never return to college to complete their professional edu- '
cation.
Lark of Leaders
Historians and statesmen have been guick to point out the prob-1
lems inherent in the rehabilitation of Europe after both World !
Wars. One of the basic problems was a lack of trained and edu-!
cated leaders—men who could pick their nations out of defeat and
assume the task of reconstruction.
The editorial in the Cal paper states:
"Somehow it doesn't seem fair that a certain group who, be
cause of their ability to pay tuition at a college by some means, :
honest or otherwise, or are capable of maintaining numerical
standing in a class average, should be exempted from the horrors
of war."
We aren't trying to establish rationale for excusing college stu
dents from what the Cal flag-wavers call "the tortures a war can in-1
flict on the human body."
Instead we are looking at the long-run picture of a nation which
could be left without educated leaders in future years.
Finaneial Waste
It is amazing that a land-grant school such as Cal, financed by
the California taxpayers, should suggest the drafting of all college
men. This would be a waste of state buildings, eguipment, re- 1
search facilities, and personnel.
Why should the government pull young men out of an institu- j
tion already functioning and place them in camps, which would
have to be entirely reorganized at great expense?
In addition to this, Cal has a compulsory ROTC program which
represents a logical system for other schools during a period of
national er For while qualified men are learning the
more specialized and essential skills in liberal arts and the sci
ences, they are also instructed in the application of their knowl
edge in positions of military leadership.
The question of who should be allowed to continue this type of
education is immediately asked.
A Question of Merit
The process of screening potential college students should be
based on strict aptitude tests. This flow of trained personnel must
continue.
The Trytten Committee has pointed out that there are two cut
off points at which unsatisfactory students' so-called deferments
can be discontinued and they can be tossed straight into boot
camp.
These standards are the aptitude test for entrance into the col- j
lege training and the individual's scholastic record according to
class averages. The weakest men in each class would fall by the
wayside by a process of "gradual attrition."
Some say. "why can't the deferred group be limited to essen
tial fields such as chemistry, engineering, and medicine?"
However, who can say what the essential fields may be. At
first of the last war a Japanese teacher would probably have been
considered unessential, yet who could be more valuable in the
military intelligence department during the Pacific campaigns?
Hence the draft picture, which was seen by the Daily Cali
fornian, The News, and many observers as something which
should be solved with impulsive thrusts into the ranks of college
students, looks more and more different as it is eyed with long
term perspective.
