of the Foreign Scholarship Committee, is now underway with a
proposal from the Free University of Berlin.
This program will bring a student from a foreign university to
study at Stanford for an academic year in exchange for a Farm

foreign students attending Stanford.
The Committee has applied to 11
countries — Germany, France, Italy,
