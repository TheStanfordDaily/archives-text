### 
Stanford's civilian defense pro
gram advanced another half-step to
word completion late last week with
the return of Fire Chief John J. Mar
ston from a three-day conference on
defense preparedness in Sacramento.
Praising the State's Civil Defense
and Disaster Relief setup and its full- s
' time director, Ma.j. Gen. Walter M.
I Robertson, the Stanford chief came
! home Friday loaded with multi
j paged booklets, pamphlets, and
j charts outlining emergency fire, j
| health, and disaster techniques.
But he was skeptical when asked if
| the state's program would see a rapid j
| conclusion.
"Everybody's waiting on the fed
eral government in Washington,"
Marston commented, "both for
money appropriations and further
organizational directives."
Commenting on the Stanford scene, I
the Fire Chief announced that this
j University's two warning sirens — |
held over from the last war—have
j been checked and are ready for in
| stallation. The sirens are expected to
I be mounted by the Corporation Yard
j "sometime this week," according to
Carroll Blacker, chief of the Public
! Utilities Division of the Civilian De
| fense program here.
I Marston said the communications
facilities now located in the fire
house "could serve as a control
; center in case of an attack." Uni
versity plans, however, call for a
more elaborate setup with which to
control and co-ordinate the six di
j visions integrated in Stanford's
| civil defense program — should
there be an emergency.
Commenting on the Sacramento
| conference, which was attended by
I representatives from local communi
ties and counties throughout the
i state, Marston said that present plans
; call for a force of 1.500,000 state vol
-1 unteer workers.
He said the keynote of the three-
I day session was "standardization"—
! wherein each separate civilian de
fense grouping (municipality, county,
j and region) would he organized on an
| identical basis with common objec
| tives in mind.
The Fire Chief said there was lit
j tie talk of an A-bomb attack as
separate from "any kind of disas
ter." He said that present plans,
which are in the organizational
, stage only, envision preparedness
in the event of any kind of general
disaster.
Marston also commented that there
| was "nothing said" of the erection of
{ bomb shelters. He said the state plan
j ners were waiting on Washington for
j action on a three-billion-dollar bill
which is expected to include a shelter
directive.

j University's two warning sirens — |
held over from the last war—have
j been checked and are ready for in

I be mounted by the Corporation Yard
j "sometime this week," according to
Carroll Blacker, chief of the Public
! Utilities Division of the Civilian De
| fense program here.
I Marston said the communications
facilities now located in the fire
house "could serve as a control
; center in case of an attack." Uni
versity plans, however, call for a
more elaborate setup with which to
control and co-ordinate the six di
j visions integrated in Stanford's
| civil defense program — should
there be an emergency.
Commenting on the Sacramento
| conference, which was attended by
I representatives from local communi
ties and counties throughout the
i state, Marston said that present plans
; call for a force of 1.500,000 state vol
-1 unteer workers.
He said the keynote of the three-
I day session was "standardization"—
! wherein each separate civilian de
fense grouping (municipality, county,
j and region) would he organized on an
| identical basis with common objec
| tives in mind.
The Fire Chief said there was lit
j tie talk of an A-bomb attack as
separate from "any kind of disas
ter." He said that present plans,
which are in the organizational
, stage only, envision preparedness
in the event of any kind of general
disaster.
Marston also commented that there
| was "nothing said" of the erection of
{ bomb shelters. He said the state plan
j ners were waiting on Washington for
j action on a three-billion-dollar bill
which is expected to include a shelter
directive.
Stanford's civilian defense pro
gram advanced another half-step to
word completion late last week with
the return of Fire Chief John J. Mar
ston from a three-day conference on
defense preparedness in Sacramento.

and Disaster Relief setup and its full- s

I Robertson, the Stanford chief came
! home Friday loaded with multi
j paged booklets, pamphlets, and
j charts outlining emergency fire, j
| health, and disaster techniques.
But he was skeptical when asked if
| the state's program would see a rapid j
| conclusion.
"Everybody's waiting on the fed
eral government in Washington,"
Marston commented, "both for
money appropriations and further
organizational directives."
