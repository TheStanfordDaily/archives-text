# Fraternity Open Houses Enter Second Day
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
Fraternities on the Lower Row will host hundreds of curious
and eager freshmentfrom 7:15 to 9:15 tonight as the week of fra
ternity open houses goes into its second day.
Last night the 12 Upper Row houses and more than 75 percent
of the men of '54 exchanged best feet forward for two crowded

i hours, and though a few fraternal |
i faux pas were reported, all the
' freshmen returned home safely and |
I the houses were preparinc for an- j
j other round of introductions tomor- ]
| row night.
Derek Bok, head sponsor of En
cina, reported that more than threc
i fourths of the hall was emptied as
I the frosh embarked for their first
[ look - sec at Stanford's fraternity
houses.
High Turnout
Claude Rosenberg, resident assist
i ant at Toyon, estimated that at least ]
!)0 per cent of the Toyon freshmen
! went house-calling last night—just i
about everybody but the one poor
individual who didn't get his suit
back from the cleaners yet.
Virtually all of the houses re- |
ported a much better turnout of !
rushees this year than last, particu
larly the houses far up the Row.
Some Greek - letter domiciles fig- \
tired their doors swung open to more [
than 100 hopefuls within the first
! hour.
The members of at least one fra
ternity were still upstairs putting on
their best bib and tuck when the
vanguard of newlv shaven frosh
tapped at the front door promptly at
7:15. Before long, each of the 12
houses was a conglomeration of ci
1 der, doughnuts, tired shaking hands, j
and forgotten names.
Runs Smoothly
Both freshmen and actives seemed j
to think everything came off |
smoothly, and several frosh were
heard to remark that the house
members appeared eager to have
them stay all night. %
There were the inevitable woebe
gone souls who in a rash of forget
fulness used the word "frat," but in
most cases a weak "-ernity" fol
lowed as an afterthought. Too, there
wj.;. also the ease of the student who
"just wanted to a house mem-

ber" but got caught by the arm, led
through the house, and wined and
dined before he could sec his buddy.
Some of the aspirants appeared a
bit nervous as thev visited their first
fraternity, but then so did many of
the actives. By 7:30, both sides were
relaxed. By 9:15, both were tired.
When the freshmen begin clasping
hands with the men of the Lower
Row tonight, they will be two-hour
rushing veterans, but the main con
versat.on-opencr will probably still
be, "Nice house you have here."
Lower Row houses that will have
their turn with the rushees tonight
