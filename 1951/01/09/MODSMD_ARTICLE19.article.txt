# Truman Asks 10-Point Plan of New Congress
## 'Preparing for Total Mobilization Only Hope For Peace'; Reply Given to GOP Criticism 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP) —President Truman told Congress today that Russian lust for world
conquest threatens "full scale war" and the only hope for peace lies in preparing for total mobiliza
tion "on very short notice."
In a somber State of the Union message, delivered in person to a joint session of the new House
and Senate, he laid down a 10-point legislative program in which his "Fair Deal" measures were all

but buried in favor of a massive de-+
fen.se effort.
"We are preparing for full wartime
mobilization if that should be neces
sary," he said. "If we build our
strength—and wc are building it—
the Soviet rulers may face the facts
and lay aside their plans to take over
the world."
"We will fight if fight we must, to
keep our freedom and prevent justice '
from being destroyed."
Higher Taxes
Reserving details for later mes
sages, Mr. Truman announced he will
seek many more billions for the
armed forces, "a major increase in
taxes," tougher draft legislation, con
tinued military and economic aid to
other free nations and broader pow
ers to control wages, prices, and rents.
He promised an all-out production
drive that will give American indus
try the capacity to turn out up to 50,-
000 combat planes and 35,000 tanks a
year. And he warned that will mean
"shortages of various consumer
goods" for the home front.
Replies to GOP
Mr. Truman did not refer directly |
to recent speeches by former Presi- !
dent Herbert Hoover, Sen. Robert A.
Taft, R., 0., and other GOP leaders
who oppose sending more American
troops to Western Europe. But he of- j
fered a point-by-point reply to many
of their arguments for a new foreign
policy.
To Mr. Hoover's proposal that the '
United States withdraw into a West
ern Hemisphere "Gibraltar," the,
President replied:
"Our own national security is
| deeply involved with that of other
| free nations. While they need our ,
] support, we equally need theirs. No
: one nation can find protection in a
| selfish search for a safe haven from ■
j the storm."
In obvious response to Taft's warn
-1 ing that the United States will be
i courting military disaster if it com
mits a large ground army to Wcst-
I ern Europe, Mr. Truman said:
"If Western Europe were to fall to
j Soviet hands, it would double the
Soviet supply of coal and triple the
Soviet supply of steel. If the free na
tions of Asia and Africa should fall to
; Soviet Russia we would lose the
j sources of many of our most vital raw
materials, including uranium, which
is the basis of our atomic power."
Congressmen Applaud
"The Soviet Union does not have to
! attack the United States to secure
j domination of the world," he said. "It
can achieve its ends by isolating us
I and swallowing up all our Allies."
Congressmen generally applauded
Mr. Truman's blunt notice that the
United States will get ready to fight
if necessary against Russian impe
rialism. But their reaction showed
that some details of his program will
be sharply contested.
Details of the President's program
will be given out in his annual eco
nomic report, which goes to Congress
later this week, and in his budget
message, which will be submitted
next Monday.
He is expected to propose a de
: fense-hcavy budget ranging upwards
of $75,000,000,000. by far the largest
i in peacetime history, and to ask for
i tax increases possibly ranging up to
; $10,000,000,000 a year.
The draft law revision which be
I said he will request probably will
J provide for induction of 18-year
| olds and extend the service period
from 21 to 27 or 30 months.
