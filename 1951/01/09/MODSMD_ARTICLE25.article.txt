# The 						Real Threat
## 
### 
Last night, Stanford's newest crop of fresh
men took their first look into the houses of one
half of Stanford's 24 Greek-letter fraternities.
Tonight they will open the doors to the remain
ing twelve.
In previous years, as rushing season has got
ten under way, freshmen as well as fraternity
men have donned their best Sunday smiles in
an effort to make the appropriate impressions.
This year, due to an ever-tightening draft pro
gram that has already taken more than a few
How men, the balancing scales are expected to
be somewhat unbalanced. The Grecians, most
ol them under orders from national offices to
"pledge as many men as possible," will be
preying heavily on the frosh. Their end of the
scales will be laden with the burdens of self
preservation that have come from war in Korea.
War—or the possibility of war—has much
Ihw same effect on fraternities as it has on uni
versities. This University, as evidenced by
Dean Donald Winbigler's recent explanation of
the draft and its relation to Stanford, is plainly
concerned about making ends meet as it faces
the very real possibility of having its ranks
decimated within the space of two or three
schools months.
And while Stanford can theoretically fill its
empty rolls with students of the opposite sex,
each fraternity — with or without members —
inusi still pay the rent, keep up the house, and
support the national office.
All of which means a "real rush" these first
two weeks—and probably for some time after
that. But in the spirit of it all, and because we
do not feel that fraternity men or rushees
should lower their selective standards either to
gaiti members or become members, we would
oflter a word of caution.

Stanford fraternities will not die as a result
of the war. The Army may take over the houses
temporarily, but, as happened last time, the
Greeks are almost a sure bet to return once
the conflict is ended.
The one thing that sticks out as a real threat
to the existence of the 24 houses—a factor
which President Sterling has reiterated time
and time again—is the possibility of the fra
ternities failing to make a real and constant
contribution to the life, honor ,and prestige
of the University.
We are confident that the goals of every fra
ternity at Stanford are of the highest caliber. j
However, as the fraternities assume a larger
percentage of Stanford's male population, as
they are sure to do, their responsibilities to the
University will grow. There will no longer be
"another chance" when fraternities attach their
names to what some newspapers have labeled
"wild parties resulting in banishment from the
campus."
In our opinion, the fraternities will have, to
Jive up to their highest ideals both during the
ensuing rushing period and throughout the
years to come if they are to withstand the real !
threat to their existence.
Meanwhile, the houses will have a chance to
contribute a great deal both to the University
and to themselves. As a group they can donate
blood, lend their services to the Farm's civilian
defense program which is already under way,
and, as always, boom for higher grades within
fraternity ranks.
Let's realize just where the threat lies when
speaking of "dying" fraternities. It lies with
the caliber of the members themselves —
whether their number be large or small.—R. R.

However, as the fraternities assume a larger
percentage of Stanford's male population, as
they are sure to do, their responsibilities to the
University will grow. There will no longer be
"another chance" when fraternities attach their
names to what some newspapers have labeled
"wild parties resulting in banishment from the
campus."
In our opinion, the fraternities will have, to
Jive up to their highest ideals both during the
ensuing rushing period and throughout the
years to come if they are to withstand the real !
threat to their existence.
Meanwhile, the houses will have a chance to
contribute a great deal both to the University
and to themselves. As a group they can donate
blood, lend their services to the Farm's civilian
defense program which is already under way,
and, as always, boom for higher grades within
fraternity ranks.
Let's realize just where the threat lies when
speaking of "dying" fraternities. It lies with
the caliber of the members themselves —
whether their number be large or small.—R. R.
Last night, Stanford's newest crop of fresh
men took their first look into the houses of one
half of Stanford's 24 Greek-letter fraternities.
Tonight they will open the doors to the remain
ing twelve.
In previous years, as rushing season has got
ten under way, freshmen as well as fraternity
men have donned their best Sunday smiles in
an effort to make the appropriate impressions.
This year, due to an ever-tightening draft pro
gram that has already taken more than a few
How men, the balancing scales are expected to
be somewhat unbalanced. The Grecians, most
ol them under orders from national offices to
"pledge as many men as possible," will be
preying heavily on the frosh. Their end of the
scales will be laden with the burdens of self
preservation that have come from war in Korea.
War—or the possibility of war—has much
Ihw same effect on fraternities as it has on uni
versities. This University, as evidenced by
Dean Donald Winbigler's recent explanation of
the draft and its relation to Stanford, is plainly
concerned about making ends meet as it faces
the very real possibility of having its ranks
decimated within the space of two or three
schools months.
And while Stanford can theoretically fill its
empty rolls with students of the opposite sex,
each fraternity — with or without members —
inusi still pay the rent, keep up the house, and
support the national office.
All of which means a "real rush" these first
two weeks—and probably for some time after
that. But in the spirit of it all, and because we
do not feel that fraternity men or rushees
should lower their selective standards either to
gaiti members or become members, we would
oflter a word of caution.

Stanford fraternities will not die as a result
of the war. The Army may take over the houses
temporarily, but, as happened last time, the
Greeks are almost a sure bet to return once
the conflict is ended.
The one thing that sticks out as a real threat
to the existence of the 24 houses—a factor
which President Sterling has reiterated time
and time again—is the possibility of the fra
ternities failing to make a real and constant
contribution to the life, honor ,and prestige
of the University.
We are confident that the goals of every fra
ternity at Stanford are of the highest caliber. j
