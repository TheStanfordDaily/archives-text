# 'I' Week—A New Venture
## 
### 
The lIR is inaugurating another plan which
may become an annual affair, the International
Week opening tonight. This can follow the
precedent of the "Mock UN Assembly," which
will be held for the third time this spring, only
if we, as members of the student community,
participate in making it a success.
The lIR has laid the groundwork, and will
continue its work in conducting the program.
It is-up to us to follow through.
Admiral Chester A. Nimitz will keynote the
week's activities tonight at 7:30 in Memorial
Auditorium with a talk on "The United Nations
cind Korea." A top-command leader of the last
war's Pacific campaign, the Admiral is in a po
sition to contribute valuable insight to the prob
lems facing the UN in its present Far Eastern
battle.
The purpose of "I" Week is twofold:
1. To give us an. opportunity to become bet

ter acquainted with the international work of
the IIR; and
2. To give us an opportunity to bring forth
opinions on international questions via the
panel discussions Thursday night.
The general topic for the panel discussions,
"World War lll—Can We Avoid It?" is a sub
ject of vital importance to every college stu
dent, with the specter of the draft looming ever
larger on the horizon.
Although we cannot erase the world prob
lems that are affecting our lives, we can come
to a clearer understanding of the basic issues
through open discussion of our views and
through studying the ways of other peoples.
The lIR works throughout the year to fur
ther international understanding on the cam
pus, and with this week's international program
it aims to give the entire student body a chance
to participate in its work.—M. M.
