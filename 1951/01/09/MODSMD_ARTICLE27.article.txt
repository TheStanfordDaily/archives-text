### GEORGE STEWART 
At (ir.st the sea was suspiciously good to us, and we
went tin deck in shorts in latitudes above New York.
'J lie seventh day out the wind churned the sea into
waves that sent us sprawling in the passageways when
we walked.
The next day we downed the mains'l, a sail which

doesn't come down for a small
breeze. Alter considering the con
dition of t!ie seas, Skipper felt that
with several people seasick and
others uncomfortable from buffet
ing, it would be easier to drop an
chor until the storm was over.
So for the rest of the day we
:;pent deck watches lazily seeing
that the wheel remained lashed in
position.

At 12:: HI the next night we were awakened to the
sound of "All hands tin deck. Bring your oilskins and
sou'wester." On deck, the effect of the oilskins il
luininated hy an overhead light was decidedly eerie.

and 20 deckhands seemed to be shapeless masses of
grey.
The only persons Skipper could recognize were Bob
and Gay because they wore glasses, and Jay because
he had left his sou'wester below; consequently orders
were given to individuals pointed out as "You."
The rain weighted sail, the slick decks eluded our
bare feet, and the oilskins made us awkward and
heavy. But the storm was almost over.
After we had all become soaked in the scramble to
set the mainsail, five of us grabbed some bars of soap
and decided to take a shower in the pouring rain
near the bow. It was our first shower in 10 days.
When we were all soapy and struggling to get under
the stream of water below the fore staysail, Skipper
flooded the deck with illumination from the deck
lights.
The naked bathers were exposed to the helm where
we thought Madelein was steering. Actually Skipper
had sent her below before throwing the switch. â–  We
scrambled over each other trying to hide behind sails,
while he stood on the deck and laughed, and the
Yankee again set sail.
