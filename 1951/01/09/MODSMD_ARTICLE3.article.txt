WASHINGTON â€” Economic Sta
bilizer Alan Valentine said today the
government will make a "big try'
soon at controlling meat prices and
should be ready to enforce an over
all wage-price freeze by March 1.
But he added that most packers
believe meat controls would have to
Ije accompanied by rationing and
perhaps government subsidies.
Simultaneously, John L. Lewis,
president of the United Mine Work
ers, was named as the lead-off wit
ness at the government's three-day
hearing on emergency wage controls
which opens Wednesday. The Wage
Stabilization Board is trying to work
out an overall wage policy.
