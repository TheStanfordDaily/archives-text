LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y. — Britain
warned today that the United Na
tions might soon have to make a
'final break" with Communist
China, but urged a "last efTort" to
negotiate a settlement in Korea.
British Delegate Sir Gladwyn
Jebb told the General Assembly's
main political committee it was a
good principle to 'think before you
leap and, if we leap, we all leap to
gether."
In line with this plea for one more
try at negotiation before the West
united for a "final break" with Pe
king, Jebb indicated support for an
Israeli plan for a cense - fire and
progressive withdrawal of foreign
troops—UN and Chinese.
