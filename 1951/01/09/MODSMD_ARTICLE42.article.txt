It used to be that foreign - film
fans went to the French imports for
earthy realism and to the Italians
for romance.
But the work of two rapidly rising
European writer-directors current
ly on view in San Francisco indi-

cates that the
Italians have
taken over the
"neo - realistic"
school while the
French are in
' clining more and
more toward
'. tender love af
fairs.

Giuseppe Di Santis' "Bitter Rice"
at the Larkin might better be titled
"Sex in the Rice Patch" since its
prime assets are (1) a realistic back
ground of "mondines" and other
women workers in the Po Valley
rice fields, and (2) the introductioin
of Sylvana Magnano in some of the
warmest footage since Hayworth's
"Gilda."

As in his recent "Tragic Hunt," Di
Santis too often lets his melodrama
get out of hand, but he has a chal
lenging way with a camera, espe
cially when Magnano's within its
focus.
Jacques Becker's "Antoine and
Antoinette"at the Bridge is a really
wonderful comedy about a young
Parisian couple who lose a winning
lottery ticket.
