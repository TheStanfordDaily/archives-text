Tu the average Stanford student .
I the international program this week |
| intans a chance to hear Admiral
| Chester W. Nimitz, panel discussions
! on world affairs, and to see a talent
show.
But the international progj'am at
Stanford is much more than just an
extra-curricular activity or a degree
to collect dust. Out of the Institute
of International Relations here have
come, in the recent past, many grad
! uates who are actively engaged in
the international field.
David Chan and Robert von Pa
j genhardt are still in contact with the
i IIR as "ambassadors abroad." They
| travel extensively, checking on use
of foreign relief sent from Stanford.
They also gather information con-
I cerning travel conditions and alumni
living abroad. Much t)f this informa
! tion is contained in the lIR Travel
Handbook. Chan had a UN Intern
| ship, while Von Pagenhardt has an
, extended Full bright Scholarship.
Clifford Forster is a public affairs
j editor of the U.S. Information Serv
| ice in the Philippines. His wife.
Nancy Keeney Forster, who was also
j active in the 11R, is teaching at Min
danao Colleges.
Paul Bethel, William Roth, and
| Edward Chambers are all working
in the State Department. Howard
Lockwood, who formerly had a UN
I Internship and worked lor the U.S.
| Displaced Persons Commission, is
| now working for UNESCO in New
York City.
William Gottfried Kin
! dermann, and Marge Bacon are more
j Stanford graduates who have had
j UN Internships. Hay den now has a
"Rotary International Scholarship,
and Miss Bacon is also studying on
a scholarship in Paris. Kindermann
has returned to his native Austria.
Other alumni who are studying in
foreign lands on scholarships and
who are planning for similar careers
are Barbara Jean Denning, Joan
Witzman, Richard Kelton, and Rob-
I ert Butow.
Erskine Childers, a recently nat
uralized American citizen, is now in
the Army. He was formerly the
vice-president for international re
lations activities in the National
Student Association.
