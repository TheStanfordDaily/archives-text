SACRAMENTO — The California
Legislature opened its 1931 session
and a second century of statehood
today amid a warning by Gov. Earl
Warren that it met "under the shad
ow" of "a probable third world war."
"The zero hour may be rapidly ap
proaching," Warren told a joint as
sembly of the lawmakers after he
was sworn in for an unprecedented
third term. If war comes, he said, it
will "make the blitzkrieg seem a
sham battle by comparison."
