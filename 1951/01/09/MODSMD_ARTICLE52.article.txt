# Crew Takes Decision In Stride
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Disappointed but no hard feelings.
.That was the way the Stanford
:iew reacted to the Stanford Ath
etic Board's refusal to allocate
unds for crew use.
Jim Fifer, crew captain, summed
t up by 'saying, "We're naturally
lisappointed that we will not be able
â€¢o receive any support, but we feel
that it is just an unfortunate circum
stance that no one can do anything
ibout. We haj a very good hearing
with the SAB, and 1 think they gave
die proposal every consideration and
really wanted to help the crew."
SAB Did Best
Bill Meyer, vice - captain, said,
" r l he board obviously did their best.
They considered the proposal we
submitted. We had reached the po
sition where we felt we should be
recognized as a Stanford University
sport; but we feel the board would
have recognized us if they weren't
in such a tight financial fix."
Tom Shaw, one of the three stu
dent members of the board, said,
"The board took its action with a
great deal of reluctance, but we
couldn't help but arrive at that deci
sion. There's not enough money to
30 around. Ted Buttner, Jesse Cone,
and I all felt badly, because we think
that the crew is deserving of finan
cial help."
No Money
Professor John Fox, another
member ol the SAB, said, "Everyone
on the board was in favor of sup
porting the crew, but the decreased
attendance at football games and the
prospect of smaller enrollment next
year made us change. We wish we
could have helped them, but there
was just no money."
Despite the fact that the crew
won't receive monetary support,
they will go ahead with their sched
uled meets. They plan trips to Se
attle to meet the Washington Hus
kies, Los Angeles to face UCLA, and
the annual Marietta regatta. They
play host to Cal in May.
New Shells
The Indian crew is rated one of
the five best in the world by virtue
of their fourth in last year's Marietta
regatta.
It will take approximately $4,500
to support the crew this year, with
Coach Jim Beggs on a volunteer
basis.
Two new shells, valued at $4,000,
.will arrive at Stanford this week.
They are gifts of the Class of '50 and
the alumni.
