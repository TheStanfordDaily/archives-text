## Hoopmen Take Rest 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Everett Dean's reserveless Indian 1
basketeers, fresh from a two-game
split with UCLA which included j
Stanford's first win over the Bruins |
since 1949, took a day off from the '
rigors ol the hardwood yesterday.
The Cards will return to practice
this afternoon in preparation for this j
weekend's doubleheader against
Cal's two - time conference losers, j
The first clash of the twin offering i
will take place at Berkeley Friday
night, the arch rivals crossing the
Bay for Saturday night's renewal in
the Farm's pint-sized Pavilion.
Bear Sophs
Berkeley's soph - laden entry j
opened its conference chase with a j
disastrous invasion of the Southland !
last weekend by absorbing two j
monstrous shellackings at the hands
of USC's favored Trojans. But the
Bears, whose roster includes no less
than ten talented and rangy sopho
mores, should have a much health
ier future in store once the newcom
ers gain a little experience.
Carets Ready
Stanford, physical - wise, is well
primed for the local series. Ed
Tucker's injured ankle, the season's
only casualty to date, has been pro
nounced fully recovered from a
slight sprain
Nevertheless, yesterday's vaca
tion from the practice court was
heartily welcomed by the Indian
hoopsters, who only last week re
turned from an extended and tiring
Eastern invasion.
USC, by virtue of last week's re
sults, is now entrenched in the top
spot in the Southern Division. Stan
lord and UCLA are tied for second,
with Cal reposing in the cellar.
