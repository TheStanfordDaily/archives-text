# Farm's Radio Club Well Equipped; Broadcasts to Russian Amateurs

Postcards bearing a pastel-col
ored picture of the Kremlin are
among the acknowledgments of
contact which the Stanford Ra- ;
dio Club receives regularly I
from all over the world.
Although quick to sign ofT at the j
first mention of politics, Russian raj
dio amateurs discuss technical mat
ters freely and send out QSL's —radio
talk for cards which acknowledge a
contact with another amateur —to
their brother hams.
Stanford has one of the best
equipped radio clubs of any univer
sity in the nation. The main trans
mitter, W6YX, is located on a hill
southeast of the campus, near the
Ryan High Voltage Laboratory. Be
sides having an unobstructed horizon
in most directions, it is far enough
from any dwellings to avoid interfer
ence with television sets. At 1000
watts, it has the highest power at
which amateur stations are permitted
to operate by the Federal Communi
cations Commission.
Most universities are doing well to
have one amateur station. The Stan
ford club has a second, relatively
small station, W6TZE, upstairs in the
electronics buildings, next to the
clock tower. Because of a lower
power of 200 watts and a shortage of
room for antennas, this transmitter is
not used as often as the larger one.
Hoover A Member
Dr. Frederick Terman, now dean of
the School of Engineering, and sev
eral friends built equipment for the
Start of a radio club during World
War I. For a time in the early 'twen
ties Herbert Hoover Jr. was a mem
ber of this group, and last year Her
bert Hoover 111 was in the present
club.
Today's club, founded around 1928,
became temporarily inactive about 10
years later. In 1939 Oswald G. Villard
and Cameron Pierce, two graduate
students in the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, constructed a build
ing to house the equipment in back
of the Ryan Laboratory, and the club
was revived.
During the last war amateur sta
tions were ordered off the air so that
the air lanes would be clear for war
information use by the armed forces.
The club's equipment was used to re
ceive and record Japanese propagan
da broadcasts. These were analyzed
I by staff members of the Hoover Li
! brary, operating under a grant from
j the Rockefeller Foundation.
Late in 1942 the government took

over monitoring Japanese broadcasts
and the Radio Club's building was of
fered to the National Defense Re
search Committee to house equip
ment for the study of the lonosphere.
This is one of the upper layers of the
earth's atmosphere, and long distance
radio reception can te predicted from
a study of its condition.
The old building is still being used
for this purpose by the Central Radio
Propagation Laboratory of the Na
tional Bureau of Standards.
Ban Lifted
In the summer of 194G the ban on
amateur radio was lifted, but the club
was homeless until a portable, pre
fabricated building was set up near
the old building. Villard, returning
from war work, became a professor
of electrical engineering, and faculty
advisor to the club.
During the first years after the war,
in 1946 and 1947, much of the club's
work consisted of relaying messages
between servicemen on the islands of
the Pacific and their families, wives,
or sweethearts at home. Often the

messages were urgent, telling of a |
dpath or serious illness in a much!
shorter time than would otherwise be I
required.
At the same time club members
began experimenting with several
new developments. The klystron
tube, used for radar during the war,
was used by club members to set a
new long distance record for trans
mission of ultra high-frequency
waves about 10 centimeters in length.
One station was set up on Mount
Hamilton and another at Stanford, an
airline distance of 31 miles. Less [
power was used than is needed to j
light a dim flashlight. The feat was ,
reported in papers as far away as !
Florida, and the record was soon j
broken again by others.
Simp 1 ificd Transmitter
The club's most spectacular j
achievements have been in the field j
of single sideband transmission. This j
method was originally used and de- j
velopcd by the Bell Telephone Labo
ratories but required too much com- !
plicated equipment for amateur use. j

The club developed a simplified |
transmitter with which they held the ■
first two-way amateur talks over .sin
gle sideband.
The advantages of the system are !
that it uses only one-third the power i
needed by a conventional transmit- j
ter, enables the operators to listen
and speak at the same time, and uses
only half the band width that con
ventional transmitters use. This last
advantage is the most important, for
it enables twice as many amateurs to
hold conversations at the same time
on the narrow bands allotted to them i
by the FCC.
Today the club has arnund 20 !
members, including the first co-ed in j
its history, Carol Barnes. Besides the 1
faculty advisor. Dr. Villard, officers of !
the club include Bill Rorden, presi- I
dent; Jose Diaz, vice-president and j
secretary; Bob Whitehurst, treasurer; |
and Brad Wyatt, in charge of sending j
and receiving QSL cards.
