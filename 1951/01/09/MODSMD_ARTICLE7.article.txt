# Construction On Law Dorm Starts Again
## 
### 
Full-scale work on the Crothers
Hall $348,000 dual wing construc
tion project was resumed yesterday
morning. The work had been de
layed by heavy rains last quarter
and during vaeatoin.
Basement floor foundation
trenches caved in by the rains have
now been reshaped.
Footings or foundation cement
should be poured this week in hoth
wings, according to Bill Roth of the
construction firm of Wagner and
Martinez.
Following completion of *he foun
dation work, construction will con
tinue full scale regardless of weath
er. The plan at present is to com
plete one wing first, probably the
south, and then add to the founda
tion of the north wing.
Work on the project began early
in November and resulted from a
donation by Judge George E. Croth
ers, Stanford graduate in the pio
neer class of 1895.
The wing project calls for con
struction of two wings on the north
and south ends of Crothers Hall,
which will transform the dormitory
into a U-shaped building.
Each, wing will accommodate 40
students in 20 two - man rooms,
which will boost total capacity to
143. Construction should be com
pleted and the wings ready for oc
cupancy by next fall.
