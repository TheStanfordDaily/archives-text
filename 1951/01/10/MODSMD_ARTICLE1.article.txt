italled a massive Communist drive ,
through central Korea to cut the ;
withdrawal route of the Eighth

fighting at dusk carried the dough- j
l>oys and their cohorts to the summit
of high hills only two miles from
Wonju.
The Allied counter-attack, the
first of its size since the collapse of
the ill - fated home - by - Christmas
