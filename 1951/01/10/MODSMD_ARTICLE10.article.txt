# RUMORS FALSE
## No Roughs Yet Drafted From Farm 
### 
Despite campus rumors to the
contrary, no Stanford men have
been drafted out of school, Chief
Counselor for Men Richard
Balch said yesterday.
Balch made the statement while
discussing "draft neurosis," a term he
used in a recent article in Time mag
azine about the college draft situa
tion.
Under the terms of the Selective
Scrvicc Act, no full-time student who
is doing satisfactory work in school
can be drafted into the Army during
the academic year, Balch explained.
An estimated 200 to .'5OO students
have enlisted, feeling they would
be better ofT to "heat" the draft,
Balch said. More complete figures
on the number of enlistees, as well
as a complete check of each stu
dent's selective service status, will
he revealed when the University
finishes filing the military status
cards filled out at registration.
The so-called draft neurosis, Balch
emphasized, is simply a form of be
wilderment which results because tho
student can not be sure of where he
stands with his local board.
lie cited as an example the 2-A
classification for occupational de
ferment. All students who are 10,
have completed at least one aca
demic year, and are in the upper
half of their class are eligible for
this rating.
However, certain states—including
Oregon, Wyoming, Montana, and
Arizina—will not give this classifica
tion. Also certain draft boards in
California do not issue this rating.
Further complicating the picture
are the numerous draft classifica
tions. Ratings which students may
hold include the following:
1-A—available for service
1-A-P—postponement until end
of academic year
1-4)— member of reserve compo
nent or student taking military
t raining
2-A—occupation deferment
.'i-A—deferred becausc of de
pendents
4-A—registrant who has com
pleted military service require
ments; sole surviving son of fam
ily which has lost a son in military
service
4-C—aliens
1-F—unfit for military service
V-A—registrant over-age
