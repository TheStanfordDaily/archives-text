# Fire, Police Departments To Train Defense Force
## 
### 
The Stanford Police and Fire
Departments are recruiting aux-1
iliary members today in the first
concrete civilian defense step
beyond the planning stage.
The move was decided at a Stan- i
ford Civilian Defense meeting yes- [
terday morning. Alf E. Brandin, !
campus civilian defense head, pre- j
sided.
The two departments are seeking
volunteers in this first organizational
move. Only staff members and as
sistants who reside on the campus
will be accepted.
Fire Chief John Marston said the j
department needs 40 auxiliary fire- !

men to asist the regular force in case ]
of a disaster.
The police department needs an
auxiliary police force and zone war- |
dens. Police Chief Gordon Davis de
clined to quote a number because, he |
said he needs "all the men he can 1
get."
Applicants should contact which
ever department they arc interested i
in or send a card or letter nivinq |
name, address, age, and phone num- !
ber.
Problems the auxiliary force would
have to face are:
1. Cope with a disaster here.
2. Send help to a nearby disaster
area.
â€¢5. Maintain order and safety here
in case there is a wave of immi
grants from a nearby disaster area.
Auxiliary firemen will be trained
in fire fighting and first aid, Marston
said. In addition, a disaster training
program is being formed by the state, j
he said, and should be completed
within 30 days.
As soon as auxiliary police and
zone wardens are recruited, Davis i
said, a meeting would be called and ,
training started.
Both Davis and Marston empha
sized the fact that students would not
be used in the primary organization.
Their transitory position on campus I
and the fact that many are gone dur
ing part of the year, would make the
organization too impermanent, they
said.
