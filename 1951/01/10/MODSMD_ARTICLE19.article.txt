# Admiral Nimitz Calls for Confidence in UN To Stop New War
## First Talk Packs Hall 
### 
Fleet Admiral Chester W.
Nimitz warned that we "must not
lose faith in the United Nations"
in his Tuesday Evening Series
address, which officially open
ed International Week on cam
pus.
"We must maintain the UN and
maintain the of the UN or we
will stand isolated in the event of a
third World War," Nimitz told an
estimated audience of 2,530 which
overflowed tne Memorial Auditorium
ancT filled the adjacent Little Theater.
An estimated 1,200 persons were
turned away, in one of the largest
crowds in Tuesday Evening Series
history.
The distinguished, white-haired
admiral pointed to the fact that (lie
United States is meeting serious re
versals in Korea and that this
country now faces "its most dan
gerous situation in history," hut
that to become daunted by setbacks
would be suicide internationally.
Though Admiral Nimitz failed to
take a stand on the much-debated
question of the UN withdrawal from
Korea, he said he considered the de
fense of the European Theater more
critical from a military standpoint
than the Far East.
He said Russian conquest in Europe
would gain control of heavy industry
and shipbuilding, which he consid
ered more important than the oil and
steel resources mentioned in Presi
dent Truman's recent speech.
The gain to Russia in Asia would
be manpower, the admiral said, but
the European resources are of ma
jor importance since they could
contribute to an "almost invincible
Red fighting machine."
The former U.S. Chief of Naval
Operations reviewed the history of
the United Nations, and told of its
non-political functions, such as Euro
pean social and educational aid. He
pointed to these as further proof that
the UN should not be abandoned.
Before the Korean crisis, the UN
took action in Iran, Pakistan, and
Kashmir, (where the admiral served
as administrator designate for the
UN). Nimitz said the UN reached the
height of its prestige when it decided
in tavor of intervention in Korea.
He criticized the rapid military
demobilization which followed
World War 11. during which a U.S.
Navy of million men was cut to
less than a half-million. The de
mobilization occurred throughout
the world cxccpt in Russia, and
"invited aggression," Nimitz said.
; "In war we must be prepared for
| reversals. Now the tide in Korea has
I definitely turned against us," the ad

miral said, but to abandon the UN
now would isolate us.
Though the United States is bear
ing the brunt of the Korean battle,
the potential manpower and re
sources of 50 of the UN's 60 member
nations are "on our side." These lost, j
the United States would face prob- i
ably insurmountable odds, the ad- j
miral stated.
In explaining the internal si rue- I
tnre of the UN, Nimitz said that the
United States is contributing 3!) !
per cent of the organization's sup
port. This amounted to SIX miilion
in 1949, the last year complete fig- 1
ures were available. "No better in- ;
vestment could be made," Nimitz j
said.
The admiral, almost elbow deep in j
gold stripes, pointed to recent resolu- '
tions strengthening the UN internally j
as further encouragement for sup
port.
lie praised the resolution intro
duced by Secretary of State I)ean
Achcson which eliminated the veto
power «:f the Security Council and
called for member nations to ear
mark a portion of their resources
for the United Nations.
Throughout the remainder of In
