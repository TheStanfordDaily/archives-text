# SWIMMING AND BOATING THIS OUARTER?
## Lake Lag Full, May Open in February 
### MICHAEL HUDSON 
Lake Lagunita may be opened for I
swimming and boating during Feb
ruary.
The lake, which filled during De- j
comber for the first time in its his
tory, will be opened if the weather
warms up and if life guards can be j
secured, according to Miss Ima Jean i
Acton, ASSU secretary.
Heavy rains swelled the; lake to ;
full capacity early in December, '
breaking all previous records. On i
Dec. 15 01 ey Killingsworth and Carl ;
Meier, campus engineers, declared j
the lake officially full. The previous
record, Jan. 19, was made in 1934-35.
Last year the lake did not fill until i
March 7.
The water in the lake is now 14 1 >
feet deep. The depth is maintained
approximately two feet below the
maximum the lake will hold by the
flume at the end of the lake.
The seasonal fall of 13.7 inches of
rain together with the overflow from |
Searsvillc Dam, which normally !
feeds the lake, have put over 100
million gallons of water in the lake. !
Approximately two million gallons j
of water a day flow through the var- ;
ions man-made structures designed j
to hold the lake together.
The lake was originally used only I
hs a reservoir. Back in the early J
'HO's, when the Farm was really a |
farm. Senator Lei and Stanford was j
having trouble catching water for
his alfalfa crop before the water i
seeped through the ground. The so
lution was the lake, a hole dug in I
the ground and the liottom covered
with clay. A herd of sheep was used
to stamp over the lake and pack j
flown the clay.
But by 1920 members of the crew !
were sneaking over the fence toj
practice rowing on the lake. A little
later, answering the clamor of stu
dents. the Af's'ocinted Students built
a huge lw»athouse and opened the |

lake for boating and swimming.
Stanford's "lake resort" got olf t<

set when the lake opens to students in February.

BUT, BABY, IT'S CCLD OUTSIDE It is now, but last spring students swam and boated under
the sun in the water of Lake Lagunita, which was full for the second year in a row. This year the
lake has broken the all-time record by filling early. If plans go through, another record may be
set when the lake opens to students in February.
Lake Lagunita may be opened for I
swimming and boating during Feb
ruary.
The lake, which filled during De- j
comber for the first time in its his
tory, will be opened if the weather
warms up and if life guards can be j
secured, according to Miss Ima Jean i
Acton, ASSU secretary.
Heavy rains swelled the; lake to ;
full capacity early in December, '
breaking all previous records. On i
Dec. 15 01 ey Killingsworth and Carl ;
Meier, campus engineers, declared j
the lake officially full. The previous
record, Jan. 19, was made in 1934-35.
Last year the lake did not fill until i
March 7.
The water in the lake is now 14 1 >
feet deep. The depth is maintained
approximately two feet below the
maximum the lake will hold by the
flume at the end of the lake.
The seasonal fall of 13.7 inches of
rain together with the overflow from |
Searsvillc Dam, which normally !
feeds the lake, have put over 100
million gallons of water in the lake. !
Approximately two million gallons j
of water a day flow through the var- ;
ions man-made structures designed j
to hold the lake together.
The lake was originally used only I
hs a reservoir. Back in the early J
'HO's, when the Farm was really a |
farm. Senator Lei and Stanford was j
having trouble catching water for
his alfalfa crop before the water i
seeped through the ground. The so
lution was the lake, a hole dug in I
the ground and the liottom covered
with clay. A herd of sheep was used
to stamp over the lake and pack j
flown the clay.
But by 1920 members of the crew !
were sneaking over the fence toj
practice rowing on the lake. A little
