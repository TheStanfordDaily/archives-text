# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
11it hing has started again unci I'm so glad. Not that
I enjoy rushing, because the smell of mothballs gives
me sinus, and the third-floor closet is always lull of
mothballs.
But rushing is the one time of year when my rocm-

mate puts away his weights. He
puts them away because the house
does not like to have rushees com
ing into our room and wrinkling
their noses and thinking that we
are a lot of .sweaty boys. My
roommate is quite powerful, but
after he lifts weights for a few
days, our room is a lot more pow
t-rlul than he is.

1 do not understand why my roommate lifts weights.
I tell him I have numerous articles which are lighter
anil handier il he feels he has to go on lilting things,
hut he oidy looks at me with contempt when I make
such suggestions. I think he must be trying to prove
something to himself, like how much he can make
hi.s body make up for his mind.
Anyway, I am very happy that he cannot lift his
weights for the next two weeks. It. is very difficult to
concentrate when he is staggering around the room

holding three or four hundred pounds up in the air.
I am afraid he may trip, as he did last year, and then
we will have to put up another "thin ice" sign on the
rug.
Also the boys in the room below have become aw
fully jittery. What with the ceiling the way it is, they
leel they are living on borrowed time. Of course, they
are both IA, so nobody worries much.
Last week we had a mother's club meeting, and they
asked us to provide some entertainment. My room
mate was very anxious to display his special talents,
and talked the house president into letting him give
an exhibition. I understand it went fine till he ran
out of weights and tried to lift somebody's mother.
We are now trying to form a father's club.
My roommate does have remarkable muscular de
velopment. Only it is too bad that he can no longer
lilt his arms over his head because I now spend most
of my time getting things for him off his closet shelf.
However, if he keeps lifting his weights, pretty soon
he won't be able to raise his arms at all. That's what
I'm waiting for.
I'll beat him to death with my dictionary and spend
the rest of my time writing articles for Strength and
Health . . . without illustrations.
