# Philippine Girl Praises Stanford After Year of Study for M.A.
## 
### 
(Lilia A. Villa came to Stanford
for her M.A. degree in English two
ye: . s ago through a Fulbright
travel r;rant, a fellowship from her
native University of the Philip
pines, and a Cap and Gown schol
arship from Stanford.
Miss Villa is now teaching Eng
lish at the University of the Phil
ippines after obtaining an M.A.
degree in her year til study at
Stanford.
'I he following are portions of a
storj written by Miss Villa which
appeared in the Education News
letter, a gift publication of the
I nited States Information Service
to the teachers of the Philippines.)
Stanford University in Cali
fornia is a cluster of beautiful
buildings in well-kept gardens
surrounded by hills that are
brown in summer and green in
winter.
It is populated by the kindest
and most charming group of
Americans I met in the United
States. With a Fulbright travel
grant, a fellowship from the
University of the Philippines,
and a scholarship from Stanford,
I was enrolled there for my M.A.
in English.
I was assigned to live in Stanford
Village, two miles from campus, in
the least attractive of Stanford's res
i idential units. It is a group of quon
' sets and "temporary" buildings, for
merly a veterans' hospital and now
the* residence of Stanford's over
flowing graduate students.
It was not till summer quarter
that I was able to get a room in one
of the little mansions on the cam
pus which are reserved during the
regular school term for under
graduates. I heard another foreign
student remark when he saw his
quarters in the Village. "I did not
realize I was traveling all the way
from Cairo to come to a place like
this!''
However, the aesthetic shortcom
ings of my dormitory were more
than compensated for by my pretty,
lood-natured roommate from Texas

and the pleasant three thousand
other residents in the Village, among
whom were wives and children of
married students.
On my first evening I was a total
stranger; but next day I found
friends to show me to the post office,
the grocery store, the laundry shop,
and the dining hall. There were so
many of them who looked after me
that I forgot to attend the orienta
tion program for new foreign stu
dents.
Two weeks after classes had be
gun, a new girl from a Midwestern
state and I compared notes on our
reception at Stanford. She was rath
er disappointed about not getting as
much attention as she had expected
as a newcomer to the University.
On the other hand, I raved about
how helpful and attentive everyone
was to me so that I never felt home
sick at all.
"I guess they couldn't tell I'm new
here," she said. "But they can spot
you right away."
That was to my advantage.
When I left Manila. I brought with
me quite a few worries about my
brown skin, but as soon as I ar
rived at Stanford. I lost these wor
ries: I found out that my looking
different from the majority of stu
dents nsrt only distinguished me
but also helped me.
It is a great privilege to be a for
eign student in America. One finds
himself a welcome guest in the land,
the center of attention —and ques
tions. Invitations to teas, lunches,

dinners, and meetings came my way.
I showed off my Filipino dress,
sang Philippine folk songs, gave a
few informal talks about the Philip
pines, its history, geography, people,
languages, etc. I then wished I knew
more about my country.
I also danced Filipino folk dances.
For lack of Filipino boys in Stan
ford. two American boys obligingly
clapped the bamboo poles for me
when I danced the "Tinikling."
Americans have as tremendous a
capacity for work as for relaxation
and entertainment. Relaxation in
the Philippines connotes sitting back
in an easy chair with a fan or lyint;
in a hammock under a shady tree.
In America it means motoring to
mountains, lakes, beaches, cities, or
skiing, mountain - climbing, fishing,
dining, and dancing till hours after
midnight.
It was not long before I found
myself caivjht by the date rush in
Stanford, where there is only one
girl for every three or four boys.
Living in America had me breath
less many times, but it was lots
of fun. The absence of chaperons
in American social life did not
worry me: the Stanford boy is a
gentleman.
On weekends and vacations I vis
ited places off campus. Wherever I
was, I introduced myself as "a Stan
ford student from the Philippines"
and this worked like magic.
I attracted attention and curiosity,
and received many courtesies in the
Greyhound buses and on trains, in
the Wool worth stores, in the offices
of the Department of English in the
University of Cincinnati, in the the
aters of San Francisco, in the homes
of civic-spirited clubwomen in Palo
Alto, in the Gray Line tours in
Washington, D.C., and Boston.
Sometimes I wondered if the
public had not been briefed on
how to talk to and what to do with
foreign students so that they may
carry home with them beautiful
impressions and memories of
America. But I could not doubt
that the warmth was spontaneous
and the kindness sincere.
I am back home with my degree.
But honestly, it is not the M.A. I
treasure so much as the friendships
I made and the lessons in interna
tional friendship that I learned.
