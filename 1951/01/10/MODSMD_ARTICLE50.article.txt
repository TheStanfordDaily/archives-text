# Australian Discus Star To Perform for Stanford
## 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
Stanford's only foreign athlete in a major sport, potential NCAA
champ and candidate for the 1952 Olympics—that's lan Heed, an
Australian discus thrower who will wear the scanties of the Card

track team this spring.
Look for Reed, who stands 6 ft
to make a lot of head lines next truck
season. He comes to Stanford tear
ing a highly impressive record,
topped by the British Empire Games
championship. He also holds the
Australian title and record at 132 it.
2 1 in.
Although he has attended six
years <»l night school, lan will only
Ite a sophomore by the time the cin
der season rolls around. So, he fig
ures to he a mainstay on Card spike
squads during the next three years,
llis best unolliciul toss—l(>s ft.—is
better than most college discus
throwers do at the ends of their ca
reers.
Among Top Five in College
1 feed's new coach, Stanford's Jack
Weiershauser, ranks him among the
top live college discus throwers to
day. He goes on to say that Reed
ought to throw over 160 feet this
spring.
Weiershauser has nothing but
praise for Reed.
"He is a great boy to work with; he
lias lots of ability, desire, and the
championship spirit that goes to make
a winner," says the head coach.
About the possibility of using Reed
as a shut putter as well as a discus
man, Weiershauser said, "We don't
expect to use him in the shot too
much this year. We do plan to work
with him in the event, however, and
•.'room his as an eventual replacement
for Lew Chandler who graduates this
June." lan didn't work with the shot
while in Australia.
"It's Wonderful
About the United States and the
tieatinent he's getting here lan says.
'It's wonderful." He likens the cam
pus to his home town of Melbourne
because of its Eucalyptus trees.
Iteed came to the United State to
get a "fuller education." He al
ready possesses a degree in applied
chemistry which he earned during
a six-year period when he worked
days and went to school at night.
It was during these six years that
the lad from the continent "down

and weighs 13 1 la stone (1911b5.),

under" became interested in the plat
ter-spinning art. Since he was work- I
ing days, he couldn't £0 out for any
team sport; thus he had to find an in- i
dividual event. As it was, he often
had to do his discus practicing after '
dark.
Although badly hampered by the
rainy weather last quarter, Reed did
very well in fall track. A" couple of
tosses hit in the 155-IGO ft. region.
IVlathias Best
During many of his workouts lan
keeps at his side a series of action
shots of Fortune Gordien, world rec- I
ord holder in the discus. But lan |
claims that the best discus thrower ;
he's ever seen is Stanford's own Bob
Mathias.
Here's more good news lor track
fans—Keed, because of bis Austra
lian citizenship, is not eligible for
our draft. Furthermore, since they
don't yet have a selective service ,
system in his homeland, his athletic
career seems pretty safe — that is
unless Stanford abandons its ath
letic program as it did in the last
war.
Lan came to Stanford on the recom
mendation of an exchange pre-med
student from—of all places—Cal.
