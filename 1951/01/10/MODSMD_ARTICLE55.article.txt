# Deanmen Schedule Heavy Practice for Cal Series
## 
### 
Aji abbreviated Stanford varsity
basketball squad, polishing their
brand now fast bleak offense in
preparation for this weekend's
doubleheader against California's
blue - clads, went through a short
workout yesterday afternoon after a
Monday vacation from practice rou
tine.
Only eight members of the var
sity were on hand for the brief
workout, the remainder of the
squad being otherwise engaged in
the Jayvee - IYlenlo JC contest
played last night on the latter's
court.
Headman Everett Dean plans the
heavy practice of the week for this
afternoon's session, which will in
clude a long scrimmage. Tomorrow
afternoon another light workout is
planned as the Cards taper off for
the first contest of the twin bill to

be played at Berkeley Friday night.
Saturday night the Bay rivals will
move into the Stanford Pavilion.
Most of the excitement over the
weekend battles will stem from the
bitter school rivalry rather than any
strong championship expectations
on the part of either team. Both
squads boast of potential power. But
Stanford is handicapped by lack of
depth, the Bears by the greenness
of their predominantly sophomore
lineup.
Three of the first-year men will
probably he in the starting lineup
for Cal. Larry Horan, 0-ft. 4-in.
Oakland product, is an ambidex
trous forward who specializes in
side-court shots.
His running mate will be John
Ricksen, a playmaking 18-year-old
from Berkeley. And holding down
one guard spot on the first five is
Rupe Ricksen, John's twin, whose
dimensions ((! ft. 3 in., 185 pounds)
are identical to his brother's.
