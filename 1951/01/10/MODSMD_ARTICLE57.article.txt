## CIBA Spartans May Replace Gaels 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
The decision of St. Mary's Col
lege officials tu drop collegiate base
ball lor the duration of the national
emergency leaves a big vacancy to
he filled in the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association, of
which Stanford is one of the six
members.
As yet only suggestions have been
made as to a possible replacement
lor the Gaels, and at this date it ap
peals that San Jose State lias the
inside track.
The Spartans have been trying for
a number of years to break into the
last CIBA circuit, and the with
drawal of St. Mary's gives them a
long - waited break. Other possible
candidates are Santa Barbara State,
University of San Francisco, College
of the Pacific, and Fresno State Col
lege.
All of these teams have done well
against CIBA competition, with
Fresno State being the most out
standing. Coached by the well
known Pete Beiden, Fresno defeated
Stanford in their only encounter last
year.
Speaking on this subject. Baseball
Coach Everett Dean stated, " r l he
logical move is to admit some school
of good standing into the league."
As yet Athletic Director Al
Masters has 110 had time to confer
with representatives of other
CIBA schools — California, I'SC,
I'CLA. and Santa Clara. Hut be
fore league play opens in March,
it is probable that a replacement
for St. Marv's will be found.
Another Jaetor in St. Mary's de
parture i.s that the Gaels were con
sidered a definite threat to Stan
ford's attempt to win CIBA honors
for two years in succession.
St. Mary's had a strong team last
year, leading the league during the
early weeks, and since most of the
players were sophomores and jun
iors, big things were, predicted for
the Gaels.
Their only serious loss was pitcher
Carroll Canfield, and his graduation
was expected to be offset by a large
number of good frosh players com
ing up to the varsity.
With St. Mary's out of the race
Stanford's chances for a second
CIBA pennant are considerably
brightened, but any of the possible
substitutes can be counted 011 to
adequately fill the vacancy. Last
year Stanford and San Jose split
a two game series, as did Stanford
with both USF and Santa Barbara.

sidered a definite threat to Stan
ford's attempt to win CIBA honors
for two years in succession.
St. Mary's had a strong team last
year, leading the league during the
early weeks, and since most of the
players were sophomores and jun
iors, big things were, predicted for
the Gaels.
Their only serious loss was pitcher
Carroll Canfield, and his graduation
was expected to be offset by a large
number of good frosh players com
ing up to the varsity.
With St. Mary's out of the race
Stanford's chances for a second
CIBA pennant are considerably
brightened, but any of the possible
substitutes can be counted 011 to
adequately fill the vacancy. Last
year Stanford and San Jose split
a two game series, as did Stanford
with both USF and Santa Barbara.
The decision of St. Mary's Col
lege officials tu drop collegiate base
ball lor the duration of the national
emergency leaves a big vacancy to
he filled in the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association, of
which Stanford is one of the six
members.
As yet only suggestions have been
made as to a possible replacement
lor the Gaels, and at this date it ap
peals that San Jose State lias the
inside track.
The Spartans have been trying for
a number of years to break into the
last CIBA circuit, and the with
drawal of St. Mary's gives them a
long - waited break. Other possible
candidates are Santa Barbara State,
University of San Francisco, College
of the Pacific, and Fresno State Col
lege.
All of these teams have done well
against CIBA competition, with
Fresno State being the most out
standing. Coached by the well
known Pete Beiden, Fresno defeated
Stanford in their only encounter last
year.
Speaking on this subject. Baseball
Coach Everett Dean stated, " r l he
logical move is to admit some school
of good standing into the league."
As yet Athletic Director Al
Masters has 110 had time to confer
with representatives of other
CIBA schools — California, I'SC,
I'CLA. and Santa Clara. Hut be
fore league play opens in March,
it is probable that a replacement
for St. Marv's will be found.
