# Little Difference In Eastern Reffing

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9 (UP)—
Basketball officiating is just about
the same in all parts of the country—
despite the complaining of a few
coaches, Bub Ferrick, former pro
fessional star and now coach at Santa
Clara, said today.
"I haven't seen any difference in
the East or West," said Ferrick, who
last year was player-coach of the
Washington Capitols of the National
Professional Basketball League.
Everett Dean, veteran Stanford
coach, was of the same opinion. He
just returned from a five-game tour
of the East with his club, on which
his team won only one game and lost
four. But he had no fault to find
with the officials.
