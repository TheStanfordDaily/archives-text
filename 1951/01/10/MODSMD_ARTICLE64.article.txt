# IIR Works Toward Unified World

### MARY MASSEY 
This week marks the second
time that lIR has put on a pro
gram designed for Stanford stu
dents not actively participating
in the international program. "I"
Week this year hopes to dupli
cate the success of the "UN and
You" week held in February,
1948.
"UN and You" Week promoted
student understanding of the United
Nations and scheduled Warren Aus
tin, U.S. delegate to the UN, to ap
pear. However, at the last minute
Austin was unable to attend. John
Rofl', then general deputy to the U.S.
representative to the UN, took his
place.
lIR putting on conferences
less than a year after it was
founded. In November, 1947, Stan
ford's lIR hosted the first Western
College Conference to which 32 col
leges sent delegates.
The first IJI? model UN general as
sembly for Stanford students took
place in 1945). Dr. Yakob Malik, then
chief of the Lebanon delegation to the
UN, presided over the model assem
bly as secretary-general. The second
Stanford model assembly was held
last year.
This year's assembly will be in
the spring and will be expanded to
include various western colleges.
The colleges will compete as differ
ent countries in the assembly ses
sions. The 1951 UN model assembly
will be put on by lIK and backed
by the World Affairs Council and
the American Association for the
United Nations.
lIR hopes to make the inter-college
model assembly as successful as the
western college conference in 1947.
Besides these conferences of inter
est to college student bodies at large,
llR's conference committee, headed
by Conrad von Bibra, has a full
schedule of more specialized confer
ences throughout the year. This year
lIR hosted the Northern California-
Nevada Regional Conference to
WSSF—the World Students Service
Fund.
One of the highlights of these con
ferences is the UNESCO High School
Conference, which was at Stanford in
December. Pat Terry was chairman
of the conference.
The purpose of this conference is
twofold:
Not only does lIR try to give high
school students a world outlook,
but lIR also tries to interest the
outstanding students of various
high schools in attending Stanford.
These students arc selected by their
principals or elected by their stu
dent bodies to come to the confer
ence.
One of these delegates is awarded
one tuition-free year at Stanford on
the basks of discussion participation
in the conference, personal inter
views, grades, and recommendations.
The last such conference turned
into a comedy of errors. While lIR
members were showing the 172 high
schoolers the fascinations of the
Farm, an unexpected downpour
drenched all the tourists.
On top of this, housing problems
suddenly appeared, and most of the
high school boys had to bunk in the

isolation hospital, while the girls
were literally packed oIT to the Vil
lage with their belongings hanging
out of the bus windows. How many
of them will ever enroll in Stanford
is now a moot point.
The next conference on the con
ference committee's agenda is the
Northern California - Nevada Re
gion of International Relations
Club of Carnegie Endowment 011
Jan. 27-2 S. Ah.n Nichols of Stan
ford is the regional president.
All lIR confidences are self-sup
porting, being financed out of regis
tration fees. Conferences only for
Stanford students are paid for out of
an ASSU budget of approximately
$800.

lIR putting on conferences
less than a year after it was
founded. In November, 1947, Stan
ford's lIR hosted the first Western
College Conference to which 32 col
leges sent delegates.
The first IJI? model UN general as
sembly for Stanford students took
place in 1945). Dr. Yakob Malik, then
chief of the Lebanon delegation to the
UN, presided over the model assem
bly as secretary-general. The second
Stanford model assembly was held
last year.
This year's assembly will be in
the spring and will be expanded to
include various western colleges.
The colleges will compete as differ
ent countries in the assembly ses
sions. The 1951 UN model assembly
will be put on by lIK and backed
by the World Affairs Council and
the American Association for the
United Nations.
lIR hopes to make the inter-college
model assembly as successful as the
western college conference in 1947.
Besides these conferences of inter
est to college student bodies at large,
llR's conference committee, headed
by Conrad von Bibra, has a full
schedule of more specialized confer
ences throughout the year. This year
lIR hosted the Northern California-
Nevada Regional Conference to
WSSF—the World Students Service
Fund.
One of the highlights of these con
ferences is the UNESCO High School
Conference, which was at Stanford in
December. Pat Terry was chairman
of the conference.
The purpose of this conference is
twofold:
Not only does lIR try to give high
school students a world outlook,
but lIR also tries to interest the
outstanding students of various
high schools in attending Stanford.
These students arc selected by their
principals or elected by their stu
dent bodies to come to the confer
ence.
One of these delegates is awarded
one tuition-free year at Stanford on
the basks of discussion participation
in the conference, personal inter
views, grades, and recommendations.
The last such conference turned
into a comedy of errors. While lIR
members were showing the 172 high
schoolers the fascinations of the
Farm, an unexpected downpour
drenched all the tourists.
On top of this, housing problems
suddenly appeared, and most of the
high school boys had to bunk in the

isolation hospital, while the girls
were literally packed oIT to the Vil
lage with their belongings hanging
out of the bus windows. How many
of them will ever enroll in Stanford
is now a moot point.
The next conference on the con
ference committee's agenda is the
Northern California - Nevada Re
gion of International Relations
Club of Carnegie Endowment 011
Jan. 27-2 S. Ah.n Nichols of Stan
ford is the regional president.
All lIR confidences are self-sup
porting, being financed out of regis
tration fees. Conferences only for
Stanford students are paid for out of
an ASSU budget of approximately
$800.
