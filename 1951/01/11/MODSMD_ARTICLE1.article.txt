## Marshall Requests Draft-UMT Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UP) — '
Defense Secretary George C. Mar
shall asked Congress today for a j
sweeping draft - universal military i
training program making 18-year
olds liable for 27 months' active ]
service followed by three to six
years in the reserves.
Immediate effect of the plan would
be to put about 450,000 18-year-olds
in uniform this year and extend the
draft from 21 to 27 months for all
inductees, including older men. But !
it would take the heat off veterans, j
husbands, and fathers of draft age.
An as yet undetermined number
of youths would be permitted to go
to college after four months' train- i
ing, but "work assignments" prob- j
ably would be given those unfit for j
military duty. Only a very small j
portion of the 1,000,000 or so youths
reaching 18 each year would be ex
cused completely.
