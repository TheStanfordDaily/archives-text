# Lower Row Open Tonight
## 
### 
Men of '54 will exchange pleasan
tries with Lower Row fraternity
men again tonight in the fourth eve
ning of Row open houses. Tomorrow
night all 24 fraternities will be offer
ing free cider, doughnuts, and tours
to conclude this first week of rush
ing.
Dave Larimer, Interfraternity
Council president, urges the fresh
men to use their last two nights of
open houses to complete their in
spection of all the fraternities, and
not revisit houses they have toured
previously.
The nightly two - hour immigra
tion of the Row has not diminished
noticeably in recent nights, accord
ing to house estimates, with roughly
75 per cent of Toyon and Encina be
ing emptied at 7:15 each evening. In
fact, some houses have been hosts to
more rushees at one time than they
could properly feed and escort.
Although freshmen cannot pledge
until after 9:15 p.m. tomorrow, Lari
mer asked rushees to be certain
their choice of a house is final when
they accept a pledge pin. Broken
pledges can sometimes lead to hard
feelings, he said.
Lower Row houses open from 7:15
to 9:15 tonight are Alpha Kappa
Lambda, Alpha Sigma Phi, Beta
Thcta Pi, Chi Psi, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Sigma Chi, Theta Chi, and Zcta Psi.
