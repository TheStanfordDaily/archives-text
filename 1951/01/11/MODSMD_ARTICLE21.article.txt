# THE
						ROW FIRST
## Honor Code Plan Okayed By Excom 
### 
A proposal by the Honor Code
Committee to "reorientate" the
entire student body concerning
its obligations to the Stanford
Honor Code system was given
unanimous approval and
"hearty endorsement" last night
by Excom at its first meeting of
the quarter.
Labeling the fraternities as the
"worst violators" of the Code, Com
mittee Chairman Wayne Alley said
his group would probably start with
the Row in its reorientation pro
gram, which would begin in "six,
seven, or eight weeks."
Alley said the Honor Code Com
mittee would act as a nucleus in or
ganizing the campaign, and would
follow its work on the Row with a
reorientation program in the wom
en's living groups and men's dorms.
He laid down a three-point re
orientation program for the Row, as
follows:
1. A meeting of IFC "about two |
weeks" after rushin,g season.
2. The appointmcn of an Honor
Code speaker from each house.
.1. The orientation of cach
speaker by the Honor Code Com
mittee, to be followed by speeches
in each of the 24 houses.
Alley said he would like to rotate |
the system to allow speakers to talk j
at houses not their own.
Citing the success of the program
just completed in reorientating this
quarter's crop of new students, Al
ley commented that "if the proposed
campaign eliminates even one Honor 1
Code violation during the coming j
term, I would consider it a success."
He said there have been three !
cases of violations already this week, j
In other business last night Ex
com representative Phil Saeta said
the University would be willing to
reopen the Stanford Museum to the
public at a cost of $3-5,000, if it
were assured that there would be
sufficient attendance."
Saeta indicated that upkeep costs j
would be relatively small once the j
museum was reopened, and sug
gested that the University start out
with a schedule of one open day a [
week.
Excom, however, agreed to defer J
action on the proposal for one week, j
pending further information as to the
number of students and outsiders j
who would be willing to visit the |
museum.
Excom also appointed two repre
sentatives to fill its depleted ranks. ]
Dick O'Connell was named to replace !
former junior representative Jerry
Smith, while Elliott Schrier was ap
pointed to fill in for Tom Sutter, for
mer graduate member, until elections
on Jan. 31.
Joyce Graybiel, Milt Johnson, and i
Elyse McKown were appointed to j
student representative positions on
the Union Planning Committee, and
Margery Bauer was named as an as
sistant manager on the Concert Se
ries, to he unpaid this quarter and 1
paid spring quarter.
