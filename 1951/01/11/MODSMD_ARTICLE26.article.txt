# Eating Clubs Rush Freshmen Tonight at Toyon Open House
## Clubs Celebrate Fiftieth Year With New Facilities in Sight 
### 
Even as University officials iron out last-minute details concern*
ing construction of their long-awaited building, Stanford's seven
eating clubs will roll out the welcome mat to the men of '54 tonight
at 7:30 in the main lobby of Toyon Hall.
The annual open house at Toyon tonight marks the beginning of

the clubs' informal rushing
Freshmen, and others interested in
any or all of the eating clubs will be 1
able to meet the officers and mem- I
bers and question them about every !
phase of club activities.
Each of the clubs will have a table
in the lobby displaying trophies, pic- j
turcs, and information about its ac
tivities. Those men desiring further
insight into a club will be able to sign
a list and thus be invited for a meal
with the club or clubs of their choice, i
New Building
Refreshments will be served to- !
night, and a second open house Ls
planned by Interclub Council for Jan.
17. In past years some of the clubs
have also held separate rushing ac- j
tivities of their own.
Meanwhile, just 50 years since the i
founding of the Farm's first eating j
club, an official announcement from j
the University heralding actual con- 1
struction of a separate club building ;
is expected any day.
The Stanford Board of Trustees has
already tentatively approved a loan
of $165,000 for the building pending
completion of arrangements on the
part of the clubs. The clubs have
completed these arrangements and
await only final approval of the trus
tees befox-e awarding the contract.
They are currently raising $35,000
from friends and alumni to pay for
furnishings and equipment.
Seven separate dining rooms and
kitchens besides a central lounge and
office are included in the building
plans. The site of the proposed build
ing would be the parking lot between
Toyon Hall and the tennis courts.
Three of the clubs occupied their own
building previously, but it was torn
down at the outbreak of World War I
11.
Eating Club Advantages
Le Kelson, president of Interclub
Council, points out several advan- ;
tages to freshmen interested in join
ing a club. "An eating club offers the
advantages of personal freedom com
bined with enough informal organ
ization for enjoyment of group func- '
tions such as social activities and
sports."
"Scholastically, all of the eating i
clubs had higher grade averages last, j
year than the all-men's average, in |
spite of social emphasis." The clubs j
are allotted a certain percentage of
Toyon vacancies every year. This
fall, only a small percentage of last 1
year's eating club freshmen failed to |
find quarters in Toyon.
The seven clubs include: Los Arcos, j
Breakers, El Campo, El Capitan, El j
Cuadro, EI Tigre, and El Toro. Their
current membership totals close to 1
180 men and they plan to expand .
their membership by from 75 to 10" 1
men this year to bring each club up '
to its prewar average of approxi
mately 40.

have also held separate rushing ac- j

Meanwhile, just 50 years since the i
founding of the Farm's first eating j
club, an official announcement from j
the University heralding actual con- 1
struction of a separate club building ;
is expected any day.
The Stanford Board of Trustees has
already tentatively approved a loan
of $165,000 for the building pending
completion of arrangements on the
part of the clubs. The clubs have
completed these arrangements and
await only final approval of the trus
tees befox-e awarding the contract.
They are currently raising $35,000
from friends and alumni to pay for
furnishings and equipment.
Seven separate dining rooms and
kitchens besides a central lounge and
office are included in the building
plans. The site of the proposed build
ing would be the parking lot between
Toyon Hall and the tennis courts.
Three of the clubs occupied their own
building previously, but it was torn
down at the outbreak of World War I

Eating Club Advantages
Le Kelson, president of Interclub
Council, points out several advan- ;
tages to freshmen interested in join
ing a club. "An eating club offers the
advantages of personal freedom com
bined with enough informal organ
ization for enjoyment of group func- '
tions such as social activities and
sports."
"Scholastically, all of the eating i
clubs had higher grade averages last, j
year than the all-men's average, in |
spite of social emphasis." The clubs j
are allotted a certain percentage of
Toyon vacancies every year. This
fall, only a small percentage of last 1
year's eating club freshmen failed to |
find quarters in Toyon.
The seven clubs include: Los Arcos, j
Breakers, El Campo, El Capitan, El j
Cuadro, EI Tigre, and El Toro. Their
current membership totals close to 1
180 men and they plan to expand .
their membership by from 75 to 10" 1
men this year to bring each club up '
to its prewar average of approxi
mately 40.
Even as University officials iron out last-minute details concern*
ing construction of their long-awaited building, Stanford's seven
eating clubs will roll out the welcome mat to the men of '54 tonight
at 7:30 in the main lobby of Toyon Hall.
