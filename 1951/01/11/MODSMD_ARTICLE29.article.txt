# GUILTY
## Five Men Suspended By Council 
### 
Five students were convicted and
two acquitted of charges of violating
the Honor Code at recent joint meet
ings of Men's and Women's Councils.
; After another joint meeting nt the
end of last quarter one girl was sus
' pended, and another acquitted in a
; case involving the same charge.
On Monday, Jan. 8. the Councils,
acting as the Council for Student
l Control, first reviewed the case of
I four students accused of cheating on
an Economics final. The students, all
! men. pleaded guilty. A penalty of one
i quarter suspension was recom
mended. The Council followed a
policy of leniency in determining the
i sentence in view of the fact that the
! students admitted guilt.
Knew Regulations
The men involved thought that a
; word from the professor before the
examination would have made them
i think twice before cheating. But they
! said that they were aware of Honor
| Code regulations, and that freshmen
j orientation on the subject was suffi â€¢
; cient.
On the same evening the Council
reviewed the case of two students ac
cused of cheating on a final in Naval
Science. A character witness ap
j peared for one student and the pro
j fessor gave testimony, pointing out
I similarities in the examination pa
| pers.
Insufficient Evidence
The Council members thought,
however, that the evidence was Ln
sufficient for a conviction. But they
felt that it was necessary to repri
mand one of the students on his atti
tude toward the Honor Code.
On Tuesday night the Council con
! sidered the case of a student accused
of cheating on a laboratory final and
j also on a lecture final in the Biology
Department.
After reading the thorough evi
' dence submitted by the professor, and
hearing the testimony of the student,
the members found little doubt of
guilt. They recommended suspension
for three quarters (including sum
mer quarter).
At the meeting last quarter, the
Council found one girl guilt-" of
1 cheating on a mathematics quiz. She
was suspended for winter quarter.
, The other girl involved was ac
! quitted.
