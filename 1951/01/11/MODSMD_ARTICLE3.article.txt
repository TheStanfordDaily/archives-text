# No Wage-Price Freeze
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jap. 10 â€” Eco
nomic Stabilizer Alan Valentine to
day overruled Price Administrator
Michael V. DiSalle's plan for a tem
porary wage - price freeze and said
the government has no present plan
for across-the-board ceilings.
DiSalle sat glumly by while Val
entine told a news conference he
killed the proposed 30 - day freeze
because his agency does not have
the stall to enforce it.
