If the crowd at Admiral Nimitz's speech Tues
day night is any indication of student interest
in international affairs, "I" Week should be a
great success.
The University is to be commended for bring
ing top flight speakers to the campus at a time
when both students and the general public are
looking for possible answers to international
problems.
People place a great deal of confidence in
leaders' statements such as Nimitz's closing
prediction that there will not be a third world
v/ar.
However, many of the students who were
turned away from the Auditorium because of
the capacity crov/d would probably have ap
preciated a chance to hear, if not see, the speak
er. Before the next important lecture the Com
mittee on Public Exercises should arrange for
seating space in Cubberley Auditorium where
the speech could be transmitted by a public ad
dress system.
In line with International Week, one person
noted that the seven foreign scholarship stu
dents at Stanford are feted royally at teas, spe
cial meetings, and banquets.
However, many forget there are more than
seven foreign students at Stanford. Over 300
students from foreign countries are registered.
The presence of these ambitious visitors
gives us ample opportunity to understand the
interests, ideas, and problems of our friends
abroad.

As interest increases in basketball at Stan
ford, more and more fans look with pride at
the freshman and junior varsity teams which
someday will provide material for the varsity
quintet.
Hence, it wasn't at all unusual last weekend
when the spectators who hurried to the Pavilion
for the preliminary game were disappointed on
not having the frosh squad listed on the pro
gram. One man didn't even know who the op
posing team was.
As well as providing the lineups for the Cal-
Stanford freshman games, the Athletic Depart
ment should follow the same practice for the
Papoose contests with near-by high schools.
Freshmen who reserved fall quarter for ori
entation and studies should now consider join
ing the various activities on campus. By par
ticipating in extra-curricular functions, students
make new acquaintances and develop the lead
ership qualities which are often more important
than book knowledge.
There are always places open for energetic
freshmen in drama, publications, intramurals,
church groups, music groups, and countless
other activities.
What could be truer than the "grass is al
ways greener" axiom? Several years ago we
raved about the dilapidated wooden steps at
Geology Corner until they were repiaced by
metal steps. Now they seem like a liability as
people slip down the steps on rainy days.

posing team was.
As well as providing the lineups for the Cal-
Stanford freshman games, the Athletic Depart
ment should follow the same practice for the
Papoose contests with near-by high schools.
Freshmen who reserved fall quarter for ori
entation and studies should now consider join
ing the various activities on campus. By par
ticipating in extra-curricular functions, students
make new acquaintances and develop the lead
ership qualities which are often more important
than book knowledge.
There are always places open for energetic
freshmen in drama, publications, intramurals,
church groups, music groups, and countless
other activities.
What could be truer than the "grass is al
ways greener" axiom? Several years ago we
raved about the dilapidated wooden steps at
Geology Corner until they were repiaced by
metal steps. Now they seem like a liability as
people slip down the steps on rainy days.
If the crowd at Admiral Nimitz's speech Tues
day night is any indication of student interest
in international affairs, "I" Week should be a
great success.
The University is to be commended for bring
ing top flight speakers to the campus at a time
when both students and the general public are
looking for possible answers to international
problems.
People place a great deal of confidence in
leaders' statements such as Nimitz's closing
prediction that there will not be a third world
v/ar.
However, many of the students who were
turned away from the Auditorium because of
the capacity crov/d would probably have ap
preciated a chance to hear, if not see, the speak
er. Before the next important lecture the Com
mittee on Public Exercises should arrange for
seating space in Cubberley Auditorium where
the speech could be transmitted by a public ad
dress system.
In line with International Week, one person
noted that the seven foreign scholarship stu
dents at Stanford are feted royally at teas, spe
cial meetings, and banquets.
However, many forget there are more than
seven foreign students at Stanford. Over 300
students from foreign countries are registered.
The presence of these ambitious visitors
gives us ample opportunity to understand the
interests, ideas, and problems of our friends
abroad.

As interest increases in basketball at Stan
ford, more and more fans look with pride at
the freshman and junior varsity teams which
someday will provide material for the varsity
quintet.
Hence, it wasn't at all unusual last weekend
when the spectators who hurried to the Pavilion
for the preliminary game were disappointed on
not having the frosh squad listed on the pro
gram. One man didn't even know who the op
posing team was.
