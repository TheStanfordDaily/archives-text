Twtlve days alter our departure
from Gloucester we sighted land—
Turks Island. It is a low, Hat coral
isle six feet above sea level, and
nothing will grow in its barren sa
line soil. All of the food and water
required to supply its 700 inhabi- |
t.nits must be brought by boat from i
Jamaica.
'1 tie only industry on Turks Is- j
land is the collection of sea salt j
which supplies all of the British col
onies in the Western Hemisphere.
Armed with 20 cameras we low
tied the dinyy over the side and set j
out to visit the island.
.Here we drank our first cold |
I'epsi - Cola and saw our first
. newspaper. Already nine days old.
it told of the attempt on the Presi
dent's life. For the next seventeen
months any newspaper we find
will startle us, I suppose.
A day and a half from Turks Is
--kind we sighted the rugged coastline j
~of mountainous Haiti. Still a mile (
out to s;ea we could make out the j
Citadel of Henri Chrlstophe, a small j
speck on one of the highest moun- i
. tains, and thought what a gigantic
--structure it must be for us to rec
ognize it at that distance.
In the unimaginative. Cap Hai
ti* ii. where we landed, is a dirty.

poverty - ridden village inhabited
l»y dirty, poverty-ridden Negroes

whose onlv ambition seems to he
existing with the least possible ef
j fort.
The sewage running in open
ditches and domestic animals wan
dering through the houses and
streets make the smell of the town
overpowering. Yet there is a crude
beauty in the crumbling, pastel
colored architecture.
The people, since the overthrow of
I Christophe's rule, have tried to es
| tablish a democracy. But their iner
i tia and their refusal to allow trad
j ing agreements lor their tropical
j fruits and sugar cane with foreign
companies have mired progress.
They fear that foreign fruit and
shipping companies in Haiti would
begin a white colony in their Negro
j country, and they fought too bloody
a war for independence to admit the
| descendants of their former masters.
That evening when four of us
returned from a thorough investi
gation of the town the skipper was
having a devil of a time trying to
keep the anchor from dragging
because of the high wind which
blows fiercely after dark.
It took a half-hour of backing and
forward motions before the anchor
held, and we were able to get some
sleep in preparation for the all-day
' trip up to the Citadel 15 miles away.

It took a half-hour of backing and
forward motions before the anchor
held, and we were able to get some
sleep in preparation for the all-day

Twtlve days alter our departure
from Gloucester we sighted land—
Turks Island. It is a low, Hat coral
isle six feet above sea level, and
nothing will grow in its barren sa
line soil. All of the food and water
required to supply its 700 inhabi- |
t.nits must be brought by boat from i
Jamaica.
'1 tie only industry on Turks Is- j
land is the collection of sea salt j
which supplies all of the British col
onies in the Western Hemisphere.
Armed with 20 cameras we low
tied the dinyy over the side and set j
out to visit the island.
.Here we drank our first cold |
I'epsi - Cola and saw our first
. newspaper. Already nine days old.
it told of the attempt on the Presi
dent's life. For the next seventeen
months any newspaper we find
will startle us, I suppose.
A day and a half from Turks Is
--kind we sighted the rugged coastline j
~of mountainous Haiti. Still a mile (
out to s;ea we could make out the j
Citadel of Henri Chrlstophe, a small j
speck on one of the highest moun- i
. tains, and thought what a gigantic
--structure it must be for us to rec
ognize it at that distance.
In the unimaginative. Cap Hai

poverty - ridden village inhabited
l»y dirty, poverty-ridden Negroes

whose onlv ambition seems to he
existing with the least possible ef
j fort.
The sewage running in open
ditches and domestic animals wan
dering through the houses and
streets make the smell of the town
overpowering. Yet there is a crude
beauty in the crumbling, pastel
colored architecture.
The people, since the overthrow of
I Christophe's rule, have tried to es

i tia and their refusal to allow trad
j ing agreements lor their tropical
j fruits and sugar cane with foreign
companies have mired progress.
They fear that foreign fruit and
shipping companies in Haiti would
begin a white colony in their Negro
j country, and they fought too bloody
a war for independence to admit the
| descendants of their former masters.
That evening when four of us
returned from a thorough investi
gation of the town the skipper was
having a devil of a time trying to
keep the anchor from dragging
because of the high wind which
blows fiercely after dark.
It took a half-hour of backing and
forward motions before the anchor
