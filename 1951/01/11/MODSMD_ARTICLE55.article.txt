# Stanford Scientist To Leave for Arctic
## 
### HARRY GLAZE 
Dr. Ira L. Wiggins, professor of biology, will go to Point Barrow,
Alaska, Feb. 4, to continue his duties as director of the Arctic Re
search Institute there.
He v/ill remain in Alaska until Sept. 1, but there is a possibility
that he will be at Stanford for the June commencement.

Before leaving for Point Barrow, ♦
Dr. Wiggins will attend a meeting of
the Advisory Board in Washington, |
D.C.. during the last week in Janu- |
ary.
The meeting is being held to evalu
ate proposals for new contracts con
cerning research to be done in the 1
next year. Also decision will be made
as to the personnel who will be work j
ing in the laboratory.
"Reports say that the weather up j
there has been quite mild so far this j
winter," commented Dr. Wiggins. '
"Up to the end of December the low
est temperature was —23 .
"Of course, it gets colder in Janu
ary and February,'" he said. "If the
mild weather continues, it will
mean a longer open season, so that
we can carry on more research.
"Many of the projects being carried j
out have no immediate defense appli- I
cation, but some are definitely con
nected with the Navy. We are trying j
to discover the degree of human en
durance at low temperatures and
solve the problems of transporting j
heavy equipment in the Arctic re- '
gions. Gur research thus tar has been j
basic, not applied," he explained.
"There are usually oidy about four j
scientists working at the Institute |
during the winter; but there are as j
many as 25 or 30 during the summer, J
which begins during the first part of
June," Wiggins said.
"The snow clears about June 1, and j
the ic* breaks about June 15. The
lowest temperature last winter was
—58 F, however the January and
February mean was only —23 F."
Point Barrow is the northernmost I
point of the Alaskan coast. It is ac
cessible only by plane. r lhe commu
nity has about 200 inhabitants. Any
one wishing to go there must secure j
permission from the Navy Depart
ment.
Physiologists there have been
trying to determine whether Arc
tic animals have a higher rate of
metabolism than those in more
temperate climates.
"It was thought that the Eskimos, I
since they consumed more fats, would J
have higher metabolic rates, but it
would be very difficult to use human j
subjects," commented Dr. Wiggins, j
"We have been using fish and keep
ing them at different temperatures." I
