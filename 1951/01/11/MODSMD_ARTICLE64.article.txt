• iif feeling sorry for Marchie
Schwartz, the dethroned (by his
own wish) head coach. Why feel
.sorry for Marchie? He went out at
the top. He'll get a job that'll pay
more and be less frustrating. As the
cigarette ad says, "He's satisfied."
No, the real objects of pity should
bo the assistant coaches. More often
than not, when a new mentor steps
in, ho brings his own assistants with
him. Foreigners might step in.
That means, ol course, that the pres
ent coaches may get the gate.
This, then, is more or less an open
letter to the next head coach, im
ploring him to consider the merits of
the present flock of hirelings.
One of the assistants we'd hate
most to see Stanford lose is Dutch
Fell ring, the genial assistant line
coach and scout. In Stanford's
greatest victory of the past several
years (the 33 to I I mutilating of
hated L'SC) the team awarded the
game loothall to Fehring, because
they thought his brilliant scouting
played the biggest part in their
victory. A coach can't receive a
higher compliment than the game
football.
Head Liipo Coach Phil Bengtson's
record speaks for itself. Both this
year and last, the up-front men of
Bengtson didn't allow more than
two or three touchdowns to be scored
through the line. Only Cal's line
has had a better defensive record
lor tin- past two seasons.
Pete Kmetovic is' highly re
spected by all the team, having been
a great left hall for the '41 champs
and a professional two years. Prac
tice sessions are always kept alive by
Pete's chatter.
To iudge how good an end coach
M;d Elward is, look at some ol bis
proteges. Bill MeColl, Ken Rose,
Bruce Van Alstyne, and Jack Rye, to
name a few.
Likeable Bob Ghilotti. in his
first vc:.v at the helm as frosh
coach, won the championship.
NnfV said.
Credit should also go to Jim Cox.
the fireball line coach, who is going
into the Alameda District Attorney's
oflice next year; Max Kimberly of
the Braves; and assistants Emery
Mitchell, Vic Conde, Rock Campbell,
Jim Casta,enoli, Al Rau, and Ken
Ros'\
'lhcse talented assistants are the
ones who should receive the pity,
not Marchie. I think it was an as
sistant coach who once prompted
William Shakespeare to say,
"There, but for the grace of God,
go I."

Pete Kmetovic is' highly re
spected by all the team, having been
a great left hall for the '41 champs
and a professional two years. Prac
tice sessions are always kept alive by
Pete's chatter.
To iudge how good an end coach
M;d Elward is, look at some ol bis
proteges. Bill MeColl, Ken Rose,
Bruce Van Alstyne, and Jack Rye, to
name a few.

'lhcse talented assistants are the

• iif feeling sorry for Marchie
Schwartz, the dethroned (by his
own wish) head coach. Why feel
.sorry for Marchie? He went out at
the top. He'll get a job that'll pay
more and be less frustrating. As the
cigarette ad says, "He's satisfied."
No, the real objects of pity should
bo the assistant coaches. More often
than not, when a new mentor steps
in, ho brings his own assistants with
him. Foreigners might step in.
That means, ol course, that the pres
ent coaches may get the gate.
This, then, is more or less an open
letter to the next head coach, im
ploring him to consider the merits of
the present flock of hirelings.
One of the assistants we'd hate
most to see Stanford lose is Dutch
Fell ring, the genial assistant line
coach and scout. In Stanford's
greatest victory of the past several
years (the 33 to I I mutilating of
hated L'SC) the team awarded the
game loothall to Fehring, because
they thought his brilliant scouting
played the biggest part in their
victory. A coach can't receive a
higher compliment than the game
football.
Head Liipo Coach Phil Bengtson's
record speaks for itself. Both this
year and last, the up-front men of
Bengtson didn't allow more than
two or three touchdowns to be scored
through the line. Only Cal's line
has had a better defensive record
lor tin- past two seasons.
