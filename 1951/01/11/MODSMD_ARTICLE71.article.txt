### 
Stanford's wrestling squad goes 1
i into action against the California |
Bears at Berkeley tonight, with good
J prospects for a successful season.
In the Berkeiey fray the Indians
| will be handicapped because they
j have had only three days of practice,
! the team not being informed that
I the contest had been scheduled until
j the first of the week.
i The Cards' main weakness lies in
; the 123- and 130-pound classes. In
the 123 - pound class Dave Wong, !
who is hampered by a lack of expe
rience, will the load, but in the j
130-pound class the Indians can put
; no contestant at all into the field |
I and will have to forfeit the match.
1 In the 137-pound class Ted Hariton
i will be the man to watch.
Since the Bears' main strength is
\ expected to be in the lower weight
divisions, an Indian victory will
, probably depend on whether the
! strong men in the higher weight
I brackets can come through.
These are: Don Williams, 147
pounds, captain of last year's team;
either Dick Price or Rollin Rose, 157
pounds; and letterman Bob Harmon, !
167 pounds; Dick DeWitt. 177 1
pounds; and Steve Garst, heavy- !
weight.
Jack Ogelsby, who caught pneu- j
i monia during the holidays, is direct
ins; the team but will not be able to
: wrestle himself.
