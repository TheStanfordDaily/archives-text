# NCAA Flans Bitter Battle Over Sanity Code Violators
## Baseball Coaches Recommend Frosh for Varsity Competition 
### 
DALLAS, Tex., Jan. 10 (UP) —Roberts' Rules of Order, a staid
book covering parliamentary procedure, moved tonight in the
limelight of the NCAA's promised bitter battle over a move to
suspend seven schools accused of violating the controversial
sanity code.
References to that guide book may determine whether or not it ;

will require a simple or two-thirds
majority vote of the delegates to the
45th annual NCAA Convention to
suspend the institutions.
The all-powerful 17-man Council
of the Association became embroiled
in a discussion of the vote require
ments and of whether it had the ri'_>ht
under the NCAA constitution and
executive regulations to recommend
suspension rather than expulsion of
the accused schools.
Question Raised
The question was raised within the
council as to that body's right to sus
pend a school, when no such pro
vision is listed in the constitution. In
the same vein, a question was raised
on the matter of whether it would
take a two-third vote to suspend tin
schools.
The list of potential offenders was
narrowed from 10 to seven today
when the council accepted a compli
ance committee report that three of
four "problematical violators" had
gotten their slates clean.
The council also refused to disclose
the names of the three schools which
had gained clean bills.
Meanwhile, the council was au
thoritatively reported ready to put a
stamp of approval on one of several
proposed amendments to the contro
versial code.
(Jrants-in-Aid
This amendment would permit
grants-in-aid to athletes on the basis
of need, rather than the present basis
of tuition and fees with the athlete
working at "commensurate" wages
lor board and room.
The council is made up of President
Hugh C. Willett of Southern Califor
nia, Secretary Kenneth L. (Tug)
Watson of the F3ig Ten, eight vice
presidents, anil seven members at
large. To gain the support of this
group would he a major victory for
the determined proponents of sanity
code liberalization.
Regulatory Power
Two other proposed amendments
would wipe out the NCAA's regula
tory power in addition to granting aid
on the basis of need. These were
sponsored by the Southwest and
Southern Conferences, who planned
an "informal caucus tomorrow for
supporters of their almost identical
measures.
Earlier today, the American Asso

ciation of Baseball Coaches endorsed
a recommendation to be presented to
the NCAA calling for participation of
freshmen in all sports in varsity com
petition beginning with the spring se
mester.
The NCAA as a whole could only
approve such a recommendation and
pass it along as a suggestion to its
various conference affiliates for their
individual action.

Earlier today, the American Asso

ciation of Baseball Coaches endorsed
a recommendation to be presented to
the NCAA calling for participation of
freshmen in all sports in varsity com
petition beginning with the spring se
mester.
The NCAA as a whole could only
approve such a recommendation and
pass it along as a suggestion to its
various conference affiliates for their
individual action.
DALLAS, Tex., Jan. 10 (UP) —Roberts' Rules of Order, a staid
book covering parliamentary procedure, moved tonight in the
limelight of the NCAA's promised bitter battle over a move to
suspend seven schools accused of violating the controversial
sanity code.
References to that guide book may determine whether or not it ;

will require a simple or two-thirds
majority vote of the delegates to the
45th annual NCAA Convention to
suspend the institutions.
The all-powerful 17-man Council
of the Association became embroiled
in a discussion of the vote require
ments and of whether it had the ri'_>ht
under the NCAA constitution and
executive regulations to recommend
suspension rather than expulsion of
the accused schools.
Question Raised
The question was raised within the
council as to that body's right to sus
pend a school, when no such pro
vision is listed in the constitution. In
the same vein, a question was raised
on the matter of whether it would
take a two-third vote to suspend tin
schools.
The list of potential offenders was
narrowed from 10 to seven today
when the council accepted a compli
ance committee report that three of
four "problematical violators" had
gotten their slates clean.
The council also refused to disclose
the names of the three schools which
had gained clean bills.
Meanwhile, the council was au
thoritatively reported ready to put a
stamp of approval on one of several
proposed amendments to the contro
versial code.
(Jrants-in-Aid
This amendment would permit
grants-in-aid to athletes on the basis
of need, rather than the present basis
of tuition and fees with the athlete
working at "commensurate" wages
lor board and room.
The council is made up of President
Hugh C. Willett of Southern Califor
nia, Secretary Kenneth L. (Tug)
Watson of the F3ig Ten, eight vice
presidents, anil seven members at
large. To gain the support of this
group would he a major victory for
the determined proponents of sanity
code liberalization.
Regulatory Power
Two other proposed amendments
would wipe out the NCAA's regula
tory power in addition to granting aid
on the basis of need. These were
sponsored by the Southwest and
Southern Conferences, who planned
an "informal caucus tomorrow for
supporters of their almost identical
measures.
