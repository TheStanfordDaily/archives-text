## 
### FLO ANN PERKINS 
In just eight years the international program at Stanford has
grown from two men working through YWCA to an organization
with over 85 active members.
One of Stanford's newer organizations, the Institute for Interna
tional Relations began in 1947. Today every Stanford student is

theoretically a member of lIR. The
organization is entirely student-fi
nanced from tuition money.
After the war, veterans Bop Pagcn
hart and Howard Lockwood set up
the first group still in existence called
the Stanford International Relations
Organization. In its first year, SIRO
conducted a drive that raised ap
proximately $13,000 to help rejuve
nate the library at the University of
Naples. It is now called Stanford Li
brary.
Since then Stanford has also
"adopted" the student-run Univer
sity of Berlin for various forms of aid.
The university claims that without
the help, of the lIR. it would not be
going today. Books and clothing have
also been sent to universities in Ger
many, Italy, France, Finland, Japan,
Burma, and the Philippines.
The lIR has six branches:
1. SIRO sends food, clothing, and
books overseas.
2. A committee for United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization committee (UNESCO)
is the work-travel-study group.
3. United Nations Education Cen
ter acts as the distributing point for
information regarding the United
Nations.
4. Conference Committee branch

ferences every year of groups inter
ested in international problems.

the region. Stanford will be host for

the Western Colleges' Model United
Nations during spring quarter.
5. Survey Committee includes
opinion polls of Stanford students on
topics of international interest.
6. "I" Club acts as the host com
mittee for Stanford's 250 or more for
eign students. Through the"I" Club,
foreign students meet American stu
dents, and take tours of campuses and
industries in the vicinity.

tional functions of Stanford Univer
sity. It has three main objectives:

standing through support of the
United Nations.

the first group still in existence called
the Stanford International Relations
Organization. In its first year, SIRO
conducted a drive that raised ap
proximately $13,000 to help rejuve
nate the library at the University of
Naples. It is now called Stanford Li

The university claims that without
the help, of the lIR. it would not be
going today. Books and clothing have
also been sent to universities in Ger
many, Italy, France, Finland, Japan,
Burma, and the Philippines.
The lIR has six branches:
1. SIRO sends food, clothing, and
books overseas.

Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization committee (UNESCO)

5. Survey Committee includes
opinion polls of Stanford students on
topics of international interest.
6. "I" Club acts as the host com
mittee for Stanford's 250 or more for

In just eight years the international program at Stanford has
grown from two men working through YWCA to an organization
with over 85 active members.
One of Stanford's newer organizations, the Institute for Interna
tional Relations began in 1947. Today every Stanford student is

theoretically a member of lIR. The
organization is entirely student-fi
nanced from tuition money.
