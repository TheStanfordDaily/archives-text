# Eating Clubs Greet Frosh
## 
### 
An estimated 75 or 80 freshmen
made the rounds at the annual open
house sponsored by Stanford's eat
ing clubs in Toyon's lobby last night;
no one knows how many hand
shakes, introductions, and greetings
were exchanged between the time
when the first freshman appeared at
7:30 and the last one left about 0:45.
Officers and members of six of the
clubs gathered around tables chat
ting with the rushees, showing them
trophies, pictures, and club records
while the seventh had a small table
situated in the center of the room
inviting all those interested to meet
its members elsewhere later in the
evening. At least one other club also
had a separate party planned after
the open house.
While some club members expect
ed a larger crowd, many others
thought more men would turn out
on Jan. 17 when there was no conflict
with Row activities. The number of
frosh increased considerably toward
the latter part of the evening as men
of the class of '54 drifted in from
various parts of the campus.
