# Cards, Bears Battle In Conference Twin Bill
## Home-and-Home Scries Marks First Meetings of 1951 Season 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The first Big Game cage series of the year will get under way
at 8:30 tonight at California's men's gymnasium when Stanford's
depthless Indians encounter the heavily manned but inexperi
enced crew of veteran mentor Nibs Price.
Few championship hopes have been voiced this year, either

♦on the Farm or in Berkeley, but the
traditional rivalry of the Bay schools
is expected to attract the Cal arena's
full quota of 7,000 fans.
The SRO sign will be out again
i tomorrow evening when the same
I contenders will vie in ihe Stanford
j Pavilion.
i, The Indians, by virtue of a two
game split with the Woodcnmen of
I UCLA last week while Cal was
! suffering a double disaster at the
! hands of USC, are currently pacing
i the Bears by one full game and rate
as slight favorites for tonight's con

veterans and no less than ten
promising sophomores.
, Given a little more time to find the
proper combination, and to allow
his youngsters to come of hardwojd

age, Price could conceivably develop
his team into the terror of the South
ern Division.
The starting five for California has
thus far this season featured three
sophomores — the hustling Ricksen
twins, John and Rupe, and ambidex
trous Larry Horan. Billy Hagler, al
ready the second highest scorer in
all Berkeley history, has been han
dling the pivot spot, with former
USF Don Bob See handling the final
guard post.
However, Price has intimated
that he'll start veteran Bill Thomp
son at Rupe Ricksen's guard posi
tion in nn effort to find his best com
bination. It's also possible that he'll
shift Hagler to forward and open
with 6-ft. 4 - in. Earle Gibbons, a
two-year veteran, at center.
Look, too, for considerable action
by 6-ft. 7-in. Clay Gray, whose 299
points as a freshman last, year led
the efforts of the undefeated 1950
Cubs. Gray has been hampered by
illness much of this season, but
many Bear observers predict that
