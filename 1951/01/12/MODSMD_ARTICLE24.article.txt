# Cards, Bears Battle In Conference Twin Bill
## Home-and-Home Scries Marks First Meetings of 1951 Season 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
The first Big Game cage series of the year will get under way
at 8:30 tonight at California's men's gymnasium when Stanford's
depthless Indians encounter the heavily manned but inexperi
enced crew of veteran mentor Nibs Price.
Few championship hopes have been voiced this year, either

♦on the Farm or in Berkeley, but the
traditional rivalry of the Bay schools
is expected to attract the Cal arena's
full quota of 7,000 fans.
The SRO sign will be out again
i tomorrow evening when the same
I contenders will vie in ihe Stanford
j Pavilion.
i, The Indians, by virtue of a two
game split with the Woodcnmen of
I UCLA last week while Cal was
! suffering a double disaster at the
! hands of USC, are currently pacing
i the Bears by one full game and rate
as slight favorites for tonight's con
test.
But the caliber of the Berkeley
squad is not to lie judged t" »
harshly by last week's result*, 'lis
Nibs is loac'ed with potential pow
er, including three dependable
veterans and no less than ten
promising sophomores.
, Given a little more time to find the
proper combination, and to allow
his youngsters to come of hardwojd

age, Price could conceivably develop
his team into the terror of the South
ern Division.
The starting five for California has
thus far this season featured three
sophomores — the hustling Ricksen
twins, John and Rupe, and ambidex
trous Larry Horan. Billy Hagler, al
ready the second highest scorer in
all Berkeley history, has been han
dling the pivot spot, with former
USF Don Bob See handling the final
guard post.
However, Price has intimated
that he'll start veteran Bill Thomp
son at Rupe Ricksen's guard posi
tion in nn effort to find his best com
bination. It's also possible that he'll
shift Hagler to forward and open
with 6-ft. 4 - in. Earle Gibbons, a
two-year veteran, at center.
Look, too, for considerable action
by 6-ft. 7-in. Clay Gray, whose 299
points as a freshman last, year led
the efforts of the undefeated 1950
Cubs. Gray has been hampered by
illness much of this season, but
many Bear observers predict that
1 towering Clay will develop into (he
i school's top all-time center.
Everett Mean faces quite a dif
i ferent problem than does Price.
Dean's lirst five is well estahlished
and consists of dependable, rela
tively experienced hands.
Jim Ramstead at center, whose 6
! ft. 5 in. should rate hiry the honor
| of being the tallest starter on the
| floor, has amassed the highest sea
! sonal point total of all the Cards and
I is sccond to Ed Tucker in average
points per game. His scoring po
tency and rebound ability rate Ram
stead as the logical early - season
choice for all-Division center.
At the guards Dean will ofler Jim
Walsh and Bruce Iverson, both
members of the first five last year.
Both are hustlers, dependable on the
boards, and made to order for the
fast-break offense expected frorft the

Cards. Walsh is also a heavy scorer, i
his 172 ranking him but one market
behind Ramslead.
Jump-shut artist Jack O'Sulli
van, the only senior on Ihe Stan
find starting crew, will open at his
usual forward position. And his

running mate, of course, will l>e
panther-like Ed Tucker, currently
the hottest item in Coast basket
ball.
Tucker, although he missed tin
first four games of the season, ha;
looped 147 points through the buck
et for a phenomenal average of 18.'
per game. In addition, his 44 point:
against the Bruins have given hin
the lead for individual loop honors
All of which means that Stan
ford's first five compares favorably
with any on the Coast. But Dean'
bench is woefully weak and, shouk
the going get tough, it is unlikel;
that more than six or seven Indian
will see any action at all.
Gary Andrews, a G-ft. 4-in. jun
ior who cavorts at both center and
forward, tiny hustler Sid Ilasler,
and veteran Paul Watson form the
Cards' replacement covps. .An
drews performed ably in both
1 Bruin contests and has been gen
j erally conceded t» have taken
over the number six spot.
Tip-off time for tomorrow night
i local contest will be 8. Both game
1 will be broadcast by Tidewater As
| sociated Oil Co., tunight via KSFC
i tomorrow over KROW.

The first Big Game cage series of the year will get under way
at 8:30 tonight at California's men's gymnasium when Stanford's
depthless Indians encounter the heavily manned but inexperi
enced crew of veteran mentor Nibs Price.
Few championship hopes have been voiced this year, either

♦on the Farm or in Berkeley, but the
traditional rivalry of the Bay schools
is expected to attract the Cal arena's
full quota of 7,000 fans.
The SRO sign will be out again
i tomorrow evening when the same
I contenders will vie in ihe Stanford
j Pavilion.
i, The Indians, by virtue of a two
game split with the Woodcnmen of
I UCLA last week while Cal was
! suffering a double disaster at the
! hands of USC, are currently pacing
i the Bears by one full game and rate
as slight favorites for tonight's con
test.
But the caliber of the Berkeley
squad is not to lie judged t" »
harshly by last week's result*, 'lis
Nibs is loac'ed with potential pow
er, including three dependable
veterans and no less than ten
promising sophomores.
, Given a little more time to find the
proper combination, and to allow
his youngsters to come of hardwojd

age, Price could conceivably develop
his team into the terror of the South
ern Division.
The starting five for California has
thus far this season featured three
sophomores — the hustling Ricksen
twins, John and Rupe, and ambidex
trous Larry Horan. Billy Hagler, al
ready the second highest scorer in
all Berkeley history, has been han
dling the pivot spot, with former
USF Don Bob See handling the final
guard post.
However, Price has intimated
that he'll start veteran Bill Thomp
son at Rupe Ricksen's guard posi
tion in nn effort to find his best com
bination. It's also possible that he'll
shift Hagler to forward and open
with 6-ft. 4 - in. Earle Gibbons, a
two-year veteran, at center.
Look, too, for considerable action
by 6-ft. 7-in. Clay Gray, whose 299
points as a freshman last, year led
the efforts of the undefeated 1950
Cubs. Gray has been hampered by
illness much of this season, but

! ft. 5 in. should rate hiry the honor
| of being the tallest starter on the
| floor, has amassed the highest sea
! sonal point total of all the Cards and
I is sccond to Ed Tucker in average
points per game. His scoring po
tency and rebound ability rate Ram
stead as the logical early - season
choice for all-Division center.
At the guards Dean will ofler Jim
Walsh and Bruce Iverson, both
members of the first five last year.
Both are hustlers, dependable on the
boards, and made to order for the
fast-break offense expected frorft the

Cards. Walsh is also a heavy scorer, i
his 172 ranking him but one market
behind Ramslead.
Jump-shut artist Jack O'Sulli
van, the only senior on Ihe Stan
find starting crew, will open at his
usual forward position. And his

running mate, of course, will l>e
panther-like Ed Tucker, currently
the hottest item in Coast basket
ball.
Tucker, although he missed tin
first four games of the season, ha;
looped 147 points through the buck
et for a phenomenal average of 18.'
per game. In addition, his 44 point:
against the Bruins have given hin
the lead for individual loop honors
All of which means that Stan
ford's first five compares favorably
with any on the Coast. But Dean'
bench is woefully weak and, shouk
the going get tough, it is unlikel;
that more than six or seven Indian
will see any action at all.
Gary Andrews, a G-ft. 4-in. jun

The first Big Game cage series of the year will get under way
at 8:30 tonight at California's men's gymnasium when Stanford's
depthless Indians encounter the heavily manned but inexperi
enced crew of veteran mentor Nibs Price.
Few championship hopes have been voiced this year, either

♦on the Farm or in Berkeley, but the
traditional rivalry of the Bay schools
is expected to attract the Cal arena's
full quota of 7,000 fans.
The SRO sign will be out again
i tomorrow evening when the same
I contenders will vie in ihe Stanford
j Pavilion.
i, The Indians, by virtue of a two
game split with the Woodcnmen of
I UCLA last week while Cal was
! suffering a double disaster at the
! hands of USC, are currently pacing
i the Bears by one full game and rate
as slight favorites for tonight's con
test.
But the caliber of the Berkeley
squad is not to lie judged t" »
harshly by last week's result*, 'lis
Nibs is loac'ed with potential pow
er, including three dependable
veterans and no less than ten
promising sophomores.
, Given a little more time to find the
proper combination, and to allow
his youngsters to come of hardwojd

age, Price could conceivably develop
his team into the terror of the South
ern Division.
The starting five for California has
thus far this season featured three
sophomores — the hustling Ricksen
twins, John and Rupe, and ambidex
trous Larry Horan. Billy Hagler, al
ready the second highest scorer in
all Berkeley history, has been han
dling the pivot spot, with former
USF Don Bob See handling the final
guard post.
However, Price has intimated
that he'll start veteran Bill Thomp
son at Rupe Ricksen's guard posi
tion in nn effort to find his best com
bination. It's also possible that he'll
shift Hagler to forward and open
with 6-ft. 4 - in. Earle Gibbons, a
two-year veteran, at center.
Look, too, for considerable action
by 6-ft. 7-in. Clay Gray, whose 299
points as a freshman last, year led
the efforts of the undefeated 1950
Cubs. Gray has been hampered by
illness much of this season, but
many Bear observers predict that
1 towering Clay will develop into (he
i school's top all-time center.
Everett Mean faces quite a dif
i ferent problem than does Price.
Dean's lirst five is well estahlished
and consists of dependable, rela
tively experienced hands.
