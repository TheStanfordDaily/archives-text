# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
Hot dog! I just talked to our intramural manager
and lie promised me I could play on cne of the house
basketball teams this quarter.
Jit- says the first live teams are already filled up but
he will enter another one if he can talk the cook arid
hi\ wile into nbivinv. I know.' I enn because the cook's

in>, wn» uiiu jjiayuiy. i Know i can
wife had a crush on Georue Yard
ley last quarter, and I will tell her
lie's sure to hear of her if she plays
on our team. Which is true.
Hut I love basketball. It's so
much like keep-away. First one
player has the ball, then another.
Then he throws it to someone else.
Nobody seems to want the ball.
Everyone runs around the court

trying to find somebody else to pive the ball to until
.someone finally gets desperate and throws it into the
basket. Then the other team has to take the ball. I
um d to think the team that had the ball when the game
i-nded lost.
Anyway, I should lie a very good basketball player

1
because I used to lie good at musical chairs.
Hut sometimes I wonder about that intramural man
ager of ours. He never puts me on a team though I'm i
always the first guy to sign the list. He just says I'm j
more valuable as a coach. My roommate has a better j
explanation though. He says I'm in a class by myself.
I like my roommate. He thinks a lot of me.
Hut I went to an lIK meeting the ether night, and
now I know I've got to do my part whether the intra
mural manager wants me to or not. The issue is
simply bigger than both of us.
After all, people are always talking about how fra
ternities are undemocratic (which is silly, of course, !
because nobody but Republicans could pay our house I
bills anyway) and this is the way to show them that it j
isn't so. Because anyone who saw me playing basket- j
ball for the house team would know right away that |
we let nothing stand in the way of tolerance.
Sometimes when I read this column I think the edi
tor is right. He tells me, "Bill Dailey has gone to war. J
Al Berry has gone to work. And you have gone to the
dogs." N'est-ce pas?

Hut I went to an lIK meeting the ether night, and
now I know I've got to do my part whether the intra
mural manager wants me to or not. The issue is
simply bigger than both of us.
After all, people are always talking about how fra
ternities are undemocratic (which is silly, of course, !
because nobody but Republicans could pay our house I
bills anyway) and this is the way to show them that it j
isn't so. Because anyone who saw me playing basket- j
ball for the house team would know right away that |
we let nothing stand in the way of tolerance.
Sometimes when I read this column I think the edi
tor is right. He tells me, "Bill Dailey has gone to war. J
Al Berry has gone to work. And you have gone to the
dogs." N'est-ce pas?

Hot dog! I just talked to our intramural manager
and lie promised me I could play on cne of the house
basketball teams this quarter.
Jit- says the first live teams are already filled up but
he will enter another one if he can talk the cook arid
hi\ wile into nbivinv. I know.' I enn because the cook's

in>, wn» uiiu jjiayuiy. i Know i can
wife had a crush on Georue Yard
ley last quarter, and I will tell her
lie's sure to hear of her if she plays
on our team. Which is true.
Hut I love basketball. It's so
much like keep-away. First one
player has the ball, then another.
Then he throws it to someone else.
Nobody seems to want the ball.
Everyone runs around the court

trying to find somebody else to pive the ball to until
.someone finally gets desperate and throws it into the
basket. Then the other team has to take the ball. I
um d to think the team that had the ball when the game
i-nded lost.
Anyway, I should lie a very good basketball player

1
because I used to lie good at musical chairs.
Hut sometimes I wonder about that intramural man
ager of ours. He never puts me on a team though I'm i
always the first guy to sign the list. He just says I'm j
more valuable as a coach. My roommate has a better j
explanation though. He says I'm in a class by myself.
I like my roommate. He thinks a lot of me.
