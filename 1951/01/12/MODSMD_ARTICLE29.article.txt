### GEORGE STEWART 
At in the morning 22 Yankees boarded the Cap
I laitkn bvus for Sans Souci, the ruins of Henry Chris
tuphe's French palace at the base of the mountain of,
the citadel.
We rode over rutted, unpaved roads in that spring
less bus, past sisal plantations (for making rope) and

mud huts. The peasants seemed
less starved than the Cap Haitiens.
The palace of Sans Souci is roof
less and crumbling â€” but still
beautiful. It was here that the
half-paralyzed Christophe, realiz
ing that his reign was over, put a
golden bullet through his head
minutes before a mob broke into
the palace to execute him.

I lis queen and daughters with a few loyal men
drugged his body up the writhing trail to the citadel
three thousand feet above the palace. The body was
thrown into an open pit of liquid mortar prepared for
the Unfinished citadel. The body rusts there today.
At Sans Souci we started up the trail to the citadel
on horseback, each horse followed by a small boy hired
to beat it. Along the trail natives would pop out of the
green verdure to sell us bananas and su"ar cane for v.
I< w pennies and then slip back into the brush.

The citadel is well preserved for its 140 years of
neglect. Although the fortress lias been torn apart
by fortune hunters, the stone work hasn't crumbled.
Most of the wood and ironwork in the citadel has dis-'
integrated, however.
At one side the fortress stands 10 stories high with
hundreds of gunports in the wall. Most of the gun
batteries have been knocked over and rest on their
sides, but anyone could pave the winding trail to the ,
citadel with the thousands of cannon balls littering the j
hallways and neatly stacked into the arsenal behind |
the fort.
It is hard to conceive of the immensity of the fort.
When I stood on the top of one tower to take photo
graphs. my companions who climbed other parts of the |
fortress seemed the size and shape of ants.
The trip back to Sans Souci was worse than the
ascent. I cculdn't convince my boy that the shaley i
slope was not a race track and he did a thorough
job of beating my horse.
Just before we sailed the next day. Exy went ashore j
for fruit. With grapefruit and oranges three for a I
penny and avocados a nickel apiece, we couldn't corn
plain about the high cost of living. .For the first time '
in my life, I almost got tired of avocados.
