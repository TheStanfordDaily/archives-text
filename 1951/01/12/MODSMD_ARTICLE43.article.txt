# Foreign University Pleads for Texts
## 
### 
The Stanford International Relief
Organization is hunting for copies of
the general biology textbook "Ma
chinery of the Body" by Carlson, in
response to a plea from the Univer
sity of Azerbaijan in Tabriz, Iran.
The texts are urgently needed by
the foreign university. All students
who have copies of the book which
they do not want may leave them at
the lIR shack within the ntxt few
days.
