# IIR POLL SHOWS
## Student Confidence In UN Diminishing 
### 
World developments in the past two months have pushed down
the level of students' confidence in the United Nations by over
one-third, an lIR-conducted survey of Stanford opinion revealed
yesterday.
Belief in the future effectiveness of the UN has dropped to under

, 50 per cent of the students inter- |
i viewed from the 75 per cent level of j
I confidence shown by a similar poll !
| taken in November.
The results of the survey came in
; to the lIK as Admiral Chester Nim- !
itz was urging continued faith in the |
' UN as the alternative to interna
! tional suicide.
The lIK conducted its second
campus survey this week to meas- i
lire stiu'ent opinion on questions
tiiat will l>e up for the decision of
the foreign ministers and Con
gressional leaders in the next few
months.
The statistics indicated student t
j sentiment against the Hoover propo
sal of a hemispheric Gibraltar. The
j consensus seemed to favor rather j
the maintenance of a solid European
frontier of defense.
Asked "Are you in favor of send
! ing United States combat divisions
| to Europe now to help form the nu
! cleus of European defense?" GO per
j cent said yes, 33 per cent were op-
I posed, and the remainder were un- ,
decided.
Student opinion we.s weighted in
j the same Way in response to a ques-
I tion as to whether or not Western
; Germany should be fully rearmed,
j Around GO per cent answered afTir
-1 matively. Since the complete rosto
! ration of Germany's sovereignty
: may be the condition for German re
armament, students were asked the
! following question:
"Do you think Western Ger
many should he restored to po
litical and economic equality with

| the sovereign nations of the
world?" In favor were (57 per cent,
while a fourth of those iliter
viewed said no.
The wisdom of crossing the Ko-
I lean 38th parallel in the first place
divided the students evenly. Half of
: those polled considered it a mistake.
! The other half still maintained it was
j the right decision.
