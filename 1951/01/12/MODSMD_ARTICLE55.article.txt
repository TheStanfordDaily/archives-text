# Big Game Series Opens at Berkeley Tonight
## FROSH, TOO Freshman Basketball Team To Tangle With Bear Cubs 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's undefeated, virtu
ally untouched frosh basket
ballers get down to serious busi
ness tonight when they travel to
Berkeley to meet the Cal frosh
cagemen in the preliminary to
the varsity tiff.
The Papooses trade* punches with
Cal again tomorrow, the locale being
the Stanford Pavilion. Starting time
i.s (> p.m.
Although the Bear Cults don't
have the unblemished record that
Stanford does, the loss of center
Dave Epperson and guard Turn
Careen will he a definite handicap
to the Papooses.
Both have a touch of the Hu and
may or may not be available for the
festivities. The loss of the six-foot
six Epperson would particularly hurt.
Epperson is the team's leadng scorer
i'

and his height has been an important
factor in Stanford's successes to date.
In case Epperson is unable to go,
muscular Don Carlson*, a 6 ft. 4 in.
j-'iiurd, will move to the pivot position.
Hal Ellis, the lanky sharpshooter,
will open at one foiVard position
with Don DeLong holding down the
oilier forward slot.
The star of the two-game series
may well lie Oleg Suzdaleff, the di
minutive guard from San Fran
cisco. Su/.dalelY has been sinking
baskets with torrid consistency in
practice this week, and his running
side-court shots have drawn many
noiis Mid ahhs from observers.
The probable starter at the other
:uard position is Marshall Freeman,
who is strong on the boards. Others
who are being primed for action are
footballers Sam Morley and Ray
Swartz.
Cal will field the team of Dick
Turn berg and Bob Kardell at for
wards, Jerry Anderson and Gene
Dais and Harry Mock at guards.
Tamberg and Anderson are rated
standouts.
Coach Bob Burnett has been prim
ing the the fast-break offense this
past week in practice.

Stanford's floor game.

BRUCE TAKES AlM—Hustling guard Bruce Iverson will be in
the backcourt for the Cards at Berkeley's Men's Gymnasium to
night. Blond Bruce, playing his second year on Everett Dean's
first string, is a scrappy, hustling ball-hawk and sparkplug of
Stanford's floor game.
Stanford's undefeated, virtu
ally untouched frosh basket
ballers get down to serious busi
ness tonight when they travel to
Berkeley to meet the Cal frosh
cagemen in the preliminary to
the varsity tiff.
The Papooses trade* punches with
Cal again tomorrow, the locale being
the Stanford Pavilion. Starting time
i.s (> p.m.
Although the Bear Cults don't
have the unblemished record that
Stanford does, the loss of center
Dave Epperson and guard Turn
Careen will he a definite handicap
to the Papooses.
Both have a touch of the Hu and
may or may not be available for the
festivities. The loss of the six-foot
six Epperson would particularly hurt.
Epperson is the team's leadng scorer
i'

and his height has been an important
factor in Stanford's successes to date.
In case Epperson is unable to go,
muscular Don Carlson*, a 6 ft. 4 in.
j-'iiurd, will move to the pivot position.
Hal Ellis, the lanky sharpshooter,
will open at one foiVard position
with Don DeLong holding down the
oilier forward slot.
The star of the two-game series
may well lie Oleg Suzdaleff, the di
minutive guard from San Fran
cisco. Su/.dalelY has been sinking
baskets with torrid consistency in
practice this week, and his running
side-court shots have drawn many
noiis Mid ahhs from observers.
The probable starter at the other
:uard position is Marshall Freeman,
who is strong on the boards. Others
who are being primed for action are
footballers Sam Morley and Ray
Swartz.
Cal will field the team of Dick
Turn berg and Bob Kardell at for
wards, Jerry Anderson and Gene
Dais and Harry Mock at guards.
Tamberg and Anderson are rated
standouts.
