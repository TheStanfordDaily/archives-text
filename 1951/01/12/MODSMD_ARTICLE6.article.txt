WASHINGTONâ€” Sen. Robert A.
Taft, K., 0., demanded yesterday
that President Truman remove the
"shackles" from Chiang Kai-shek
and permit his Nationalist fqrees on
Formosa to invade the Chinese
mainland.
At the same time. Sen. Pat McCar
ran, D., Nev., introduced a hill to
provide $1,000,000,000 in military aid
to help Chiang establish a "second
front"' in China. This, he said, would
relieve the "overburdening pres
sure" on U.S. forces in Korea.
