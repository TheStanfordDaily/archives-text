SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11 (UP)
â€” Northern California skiers will
have some of the best snow condi
tions of the young season for the
coming weekend, the California
State Chamber of Commerce report
ed today.
During the past two days, the
Sierra was blanketed by 24 inches of
powdered snow at all winter sports
areas from Mt. Shasta to Yosemite
and as far south as the Tehachapi
Mountains.
The chamber said the best skiing
will be above the (i.OOO-foot level,
but added there will be limited ski
ing on many cleared slopes to 5.000
feet. Total snow depths now range
from three to seven feet and more at
the higher elevations.
At Echo Summit, the upper slopes
of Squaw Valley and Sugar Bowl,
and at Mt. Lassen and Mt. Shasta,
skiiers can expect excellent powder
skiing on three- to five-foot packed
slopes.
Donner Summit has 12 to 14 inches
of new snow, raising the snow pack
on the ground to two feet and more
on th eslopes. Highway 50 ski cen
ters report new snow for pood ski
ing from Strawberry to Echo Sum
mit.
