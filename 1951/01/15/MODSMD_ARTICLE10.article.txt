Women's Clubhouse.
P'raternities held many informal
yet-together* with freshmen over the
weekend, and will invite ru.shees up
for dinner through the week. Al
ready, the conventional effects of
full-scale rushing — less sleep than
usual for the rushees, still less for the
actives, and almost none at all for
the rushing chairmen — are in evi
dence.
Dave Larimer, Interfraternity
Council president, estimates that
"quite a few" men have already been
pledged by the fraternities. But he
urges freshmen not to feel panicky
ai;out accepting a pledge pin. f, nd
.said that once a fraternity asks a
man to pledge, the offer generally re
mains open.
