# ‘Go to Hell’ View Caused By Draft; Stanford Calm
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 14 (UP) —War jitters have hit coilege campuses
across the nation and many students are adopting a "go to hell"
attitude because of the uncertainty of the world and their own
futures, a survey showed today.
Morale has grown worse since the Christmas holidays, schools

reported, because of U.S. losses in,
Korea and the consultations students j
had with their draft boards at Christ
mas. Since then, authorities said,
many students seem to have taken a 1
"what's the use" view.
The typical bitter attitude of soon
to-be-drafted students was summed
up this way by Larry Kaufmann, a
non-vet senior at the University ol
Oklahoma: "Why study to be a sol
dier."
Appeal To Students
Officials at many schools said they
have made direct appeals to ;l.udcii<s
to "live as usual from day i'> day and
try not to worry."
But some admitted privately they
"don't blame" students for being it
tery. whefi their draft statuses an
so hazy.
At Stanford, administration offi
cials did not go along with the ra
tional "war hysteria" report as far as 1
men here arc conccrned.
