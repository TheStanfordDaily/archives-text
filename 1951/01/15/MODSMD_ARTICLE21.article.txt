# Cards Bounce Back to Knock Bears After First Game Loss
## Hagler, Tucker High Scorers 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
In the greatest reversal of
form since the Russians at Stalin
grad, Stanford's basketballers
rebounded from a 72 to 42 Fri
day night hurnil'ation from Cali
fornia on the latter's court lo
shade the same Bears, 64 lo CO.
at the Pavilion Saturday eve
ning.
The jump shot artistry of Stan
ford's Ed Tucker, which accounted
for 21 points, sparked the Indian
comeback. But some rejuvenated
board work by Jim Ramstead, Jim
Walsh, and Bruce Iversen — barely
perceptible during the Berkeley in;. -
sacrc—was another important factor
in the Saturday win.
The victory, coupled with UCLA's
surprise win the same night over the
potent USC Trojans, left the South
ern Division standings in the same
condition as before the weekend fir
ing. The Trojans are in front with a
one-game advantage over deadlocked
Stanford and UCLA, with Cal trailing
by another one-game margin.
At Berkeley Friday night, while
the Bears were hitting an amazing
hi per cent of their shots from the
flour, Stanford turned in one of the
most inept performances in I*(JU
annals.
Ihere were no redeeming factors
in the lethargic Indian showing—
they couldn't rebound, couh'n't hit.
couldn't hold the hall, ami their
shifting man-to-man defense was
totally ineffective against the red
hot hosts.
Cal center Bill Ilagler gave the stn -
prisingly sparse crowd of 5,000 tho
to shout about as he tanker) 2:)
points to set a new one-game Califor
nia standard. But he was afcly as
sisted by the bustling floor game and
23-point-output of guard Bob Sec
and some timely left-handed set shots
by sophomore forward Larry Horan.
Haglcr outflanked Card defender
Jim Ramstcad time and again in run
; ning up his record-breaking total
; with a varied assortment of lay-ins,
j tips, and set shots that were seem
ingly unstoppable.
The vaunted Indian fast break
j didn't even get an opportunity to
show. The Bears controlled both
boards with ridiculous ease and
completely bottled Stanford's run
ning game.
California pulled away steadily,
hut comparatively slowly as Haglcr
and Horan provided the impetus to
a .'ift to 21) Bear lead with 12 minutes
of the first half gone.
Then Bob See caught fire, stealing
t.he ball from Bruce Iversen for one
two-pointer, hit two long sets over
the drawn-in Card defense, and
added a free throw for good measure.
Horan and Haglcr joined the fun
with a jump shot apiece, and tl e
scoreboard read II to 20 hcforc (he
dazed Indians were able to dent the
netting again.
They did manage to pull it up to
26-41 before the half ended, on a
hook by Ramsteadd, a corner set by
Gary Andrews, and an off-halaneo
push effort by Ed Tuekev; hut the
j issue was clearly settled. t'.:e si/o of
the Bear victory margin remaining
the only qu" to he answered by

With the exception of t .vo field
