# Imagination in Financing
## 
### 
Last spring the ASSU Executive Committee
went into budget session one Thursday eve
ning, and by the time the smoke and bitter
words had cleared away, it was Friday morn
ing.
Group alter group ol students took the floor
and requested lunds lor their organizations.
However, too many ol the propositions repre
sented only one-way bargaining.
The ASSU was asked to allocate anywhere
Irom $25 to S5OO to organizations which seem
ingly had no other source of financial support.
In return, the individual groups offered nebu
lous things like "good publicity lor Stanford,"
"another e'ducational activity," and "co-opera
tion with the ASSU."
What this amounted to was a request for an
outright gift from the ASSU. That is as far as
many students' imaginations went.
However, the lIR, which was represented at
that budget session, has prove'd to be one of
the exceptions. The money this group received
from Excom v/as far under what it requested.
Nor was the share the Stanford International
Relief Organization received from the fall re
lief up to its expectations.
To make up for a sad deficiency in funds
lrom the budget and the charity drive. lIR de
veloped the idea of a concert starring Nelson
Eddy, to be presented Feb. 28. Profits from this

program should fulfill the llR's obligations in
other countries.
Friday night, the same group, utilizing the
talents of many of the University's foreign stu
dents, organized a variety show which not only
filled a "service requirement" for the student
body, but also supported the International
Week activities.
The lIR* has proved that they are resource
ful and that they can operate if their requests
are not met at the ASSU budget sessions. They
have also proved that they are willing and anx
ious to serve other students.
What of the other groups who argued long
and hard at the same budget meetingâ€”but who
have not produced?
If these organizations are to expect slices out
of next year's ASSU budget, they should pre
sent their cases, not in long-winded speeches
at Excom, but in the form of action and contri
butions to the entire student body.
Some functions such as debates, Men's Glee
Club concerts, and AWS Vocom meetings are
lorthcoming. However, the question this spring
will still hinge on the amount of money each
organization should receive from the ASSU.
The answer should come from Excom on the
basis of "what each activity has offered to the
student body and what each has done to sup
port itself." .
