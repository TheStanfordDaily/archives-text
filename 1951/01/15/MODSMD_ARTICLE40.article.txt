The ads say "it will never play Boston"—and it's a safe bet that
the Guild's new movie "A French Scandfd" won't get by in lots
of other very sensitive towns too.
But don't let that mislead you: To be sure, the picture—based
on Gabriel Chavellier's novel "Scandals of Clochemerle"—is defi-

j nitely low comedy. Its humor is 10- |
j bust and obvious, and frequently on |
i the gross side. But it's more than j
just that.
"A French Scandal" is also a first
rate satire on social progress. It tells j

what happens in j
a small French ;
town about 1900
when the repub
licans decide to ,
build a monu- i
merit in the vil- i
lage square but,,
unlike their roy
alist predeces- !

sors. to make their monument mod
ern and practical.
When they unveil what the Eng
lish titles call a "comfort station." all
sorts of complications arise. The
army, the church, "even the national
government become involved in the
controversy — sometimes for moral,
religious, or political reasons ridicu
lously stemming from the con&lruc-
I tion, sometimes because ol funny
' coincidences wholly unrelated to the
i monument itself!
A superb French cast plays it to
| the hilt, presenting an assortment of
; some of the funniest caricatures that
i even the uninhibited French have
i yet put on the screen.
Some persons may object to points
I of the satire, others to an occasional
matter of taste. But it's a choice en
' tertainment, and far from barren.
