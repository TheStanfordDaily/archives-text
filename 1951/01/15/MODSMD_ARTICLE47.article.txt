♦nights as he tanked 18 points the first
j night and 17 the second.
The twin killings gave further
confirmation to the statement of
1 Coach Boh Burnett, when at the be
ginning of the season he said, "This
| is the best frosh team since I came
here in 1937."
In both contests the Papooses
showed flashes of brilliance and then
! ineptness, but the brilliance pre
dominated, and the frosh maintained
i a steady lead throughout both con
-1 tests.
On Friday, the Card babes sal-
I vaged what otherwise would have
! been a disastrous night for Stanford.

j the Stanford scoring column on Sat
! urday with 14 markers. Ellis had 12,
and Carlson 8.
On both nights Stanford operated
without the services of its 6-foot 6-
