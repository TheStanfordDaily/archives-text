### 
To former Daily Sports Editor .
John Hall goes the distinction of be- ;
ing one of the first newspaper col- I
umnists in the nation to predict that
Marchie Schwartz would not return
as head coach of the Stanford foot
ball team.
Writing for the Hollywood Citizen
News, Hall "scooped" other sports
writers when on Saturday, Dec. lfl, j
he wrote, "It is now definitely known
that Marchie Schwartz will not be '
back at Stanford next football sea
son."
It was not until two weeks later
that Schwartz startled the nation by
resigning as football coach even af- !
ter he had accepted a new five-year !
contract.
Hall went on to say in his column i
"For the Record" that Schwartz
would go into business and that j
Stanford would not rush into hiring
a big-name coach until the position
of football and the national emer
gency were made more clear. So far.
Hall has been right on both counts.
While on The Daily last year Hall, I
in addition to his sports editorship,
Was also well known for his "Bull
Sessions" and handling of baseball
and basketball stories.
