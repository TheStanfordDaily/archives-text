# Revitalized Indians Bop Bears

during that interval, while See and !
guard Bill Thompson moved the j
Bears into a 6 to 0 lead.
Then .lack O'Sullivan broke the
ice with a one-handed jump from
the foul line, Bruce Iversen potted
a free throw and a driving lay-in. i
and for the first time in two nights
Stanford found itself in a hall game.
The fact wasn't too apparent during '
the following 10 minutes as Hagler ;
and Horan took over the scoring bur- \
den for Cal and shot the Bears into a i
24 to 11 lead with five minutes to go. |
But Stanford was hustling with j
Ramstead, Walsh, and Iversen per- j
forming admirably under the boards,
and it was here that the Cards finally j
caught fire.
Iversen scored on a lay-in, Ram
stead garnered a two-point tip, Walsh
added two free throws and Iversen a-1
third before Cal scored again. It was
then 26 to 18.
With Tucker and Ramstead leading !
the way, Stanford narrowed the gap
to two points at 29 to 151 before the
half ended.
Starting the second half, Tucker
tallied seven quick ones which, along ;
with a beautiful driving lay-in by j
Walsh, shot the Indians into the fore |
for the first time at 38 to 34.
From that point the lead changed
hands three times until Iversen and
Tucker bucketed a shot apiece with

j four minutes left to give Stanford a |
I commanding 61 to 53 lead. They
j managed to stall it out and stave off
j a last-ditch desperation drive
which saw substitute forward Jerry
i Peterson leading the Bears.
Peterson tallied all of his 11 points
I in the last 10 minutes. His second- '
; half efforts were surpassed only by
! Ed Tucker, who enjoyed a 14-point
| spurt in the final frame.
Ed's one-handed push shots netted 1
j him 33 points for the weekend's work
I in his race for the Southern Division ;
! scoring title. However, UCLA's Dick
j Ridgway tallied 36 in the Bruins' split ;
j with USC and now leads leaping Ed ;
by one point. Tucker has 77, Ridg- i
j way 78.
i Following Tucker in the Stanford
scoring parade were Ramstead and j
Iversen. with 13 each. Jim Walsh j
1 tanked 11 mainly by virtue of a per

| feet evening ;it the free throw line
on seven chances.
Such free throw artistry, incident
j ally, was the statistical difference in
the Pavilion contest. Both the Bears
and Indians netted 23 field goals, the
Stanford margin being provided by
an 18 to 14 charity toss advantage.

HE RAMS ONE HOME—Jim Ramstead leaps high in the air over the outstretched arm of Cal's
Bill Hagler to score a bucket for the Indians in the first half Saturday night. Ready for the re
bound are Ed Tucker (9) of Stanford and Larry Horan (22) of the Bears. Ramstead's much-im
proved work off the backboards was one of the big differences between Friday and Saturday
night's tiffs with Cal. —Daily photo by Dick Fairell
