SAN JOSE. Jar.. 14â€”Military in
roads on San Jose State athletic
manpower were felt more acutely
last week with the announcement
that several outstanding athletes
had volunteered oi- been drafted for
military duty.
Track Coach Bud Winter said that
star quartermiler Owen Moore, jav
elinist Lynn Greene, and sophoomre
sprinter Frank Buxton had not re
turned to school because of entrance
or imminent induction into one of
the armed services.
The loss of Moore will be a sore
blow to the Spartan cinder squad.
A sleeper' last year after transferring
from San Francisco City College,
Moore was one of the West's out
standing 440 men and was credited
with a best time*of 47.5 in sprint and
47.3 in starting a relay.

Moore. Don Davis, Bobby Crowe,
and Bob Nicolai.
