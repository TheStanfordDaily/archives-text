# Coaches Urge Rule Changes
## 
### 
The rules committee of the Amer
ican Football Coaches' Association
recommended that the fair catch be
reinstated and that the present sub
stitution rule be left unchanged.
The committee, which prepared a
report later submitted to the asso
ciation, also announced the result of
a poll of association members which
ovewhelmingly blamed television
for a drop in attendance last season.
The recommendations, which a
general session of the AFC A ap
proved, will be presented to the Na
tional Football Rules Committee at
its meeting in Galveston, Tex., this
week, They arc not binding on the
committee.
