B-29S RAID REDS—Japan-based B-29s smashed at Communist
troops massed at Wonju and U.S. troops battered to within 2,000
yards of the city from their narrow defense line (jagged sym
bol). Red troops, however cut across the Chungju-Tanyang
axis (1), threatening the Bth Army's withdrawal (black arrows)
toward Taegu (2). Ominous enemy buildup was reported
around Osan (3), where North Koreans and Chinese were under
around-the-clock Allied air assault. —Acme Telephoto
