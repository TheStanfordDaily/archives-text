# Power Classes Dark
## 
### 
The lights went out on the Stan
ford campus at 9:50 a.m. yesterday.
Full power was restored at all cam
pus points at 12:20 p.m.
The '"blackout" is believed to have
been caused either by the burning
out of the large motor at the Gov

ernor's Avenue well, which serves
the campus, or by the fact that
power was close to capacity on one
of the primary feeds.
A factor in the "blackout" also
may have been that more power is
used on dark, rainy days.
