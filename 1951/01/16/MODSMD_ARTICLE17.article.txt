# Truman 'Brink of War' Budget Hikes Taxes to 'Pay-as-We-Go'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP)—President Truman sent Congress
a $71,594,000,000 "brink of war" budget today and called for a
$16,500,000,000 tax boost to put the huge preparedness program
on a pay-as-we-go basis.
Congressional reaction indicated he will get billions for defense

against Russian aggression. But his
tax and other proposals face rough
going. Some legislators accused him
oi asking his ' Fair Deal" proposals
as emergency legislation.
Record High Taxes
Federal tax rates already are near
the record high of World War II and
Mr. Truman's proposals would push
them about 30 per cent above pres
ent levels. They also would force
Congress to add several million more
persons to the tax rolls.
The program would mean bigger

levies on both individuals and cor
porations, sharply increased excise
taxes and perhaps a sales tax. Some
congressmen questioned whether the
gap between federal income and
spending can be closed without
wrecking the economy.
Higher Spending
The President disagreed. He told
a news conference defense spending
may go still higher and require a tax
increase up to $20,000,000,000 to keep
the government from plunging
deeper into the red.
He said the rate of spending prob
ably will be much higher in the next
two years when the defense buildup
hits full stride. It might reach $80,-
000.000,000 or $00,000,000,000.
The present record is $95,315,000,-
000, set in 1944 when World War II
was going full blast.
"Security" High
The budget submitted today is for
the 1952 fiscal year which begins
July 1. It contemplated:
Receipts (from present taxes) $55,-
138,000,000
Spending (mostly defense) $71,-
594,000,000
Dcfiicit (without new taxes) $16,-
456,000,000
It allocated $52,500,000,000 for "se
curity" — nearly $41,500,000,000 for
the U.S. armed forces and the rest
for such related programs as military
and economic aid to non-Communist
allies; atomic development and ci
vilian defense.

two years when the defense buildup
hits full stride. It might reach $80,-
000.000,000 or $00,000,000,000.
The present record is $95,315,000,-
000, set in 1944 when World War II
was going full blast.
"Security" High
The budget submitted today is for
the 1952 fiscal year which begins
July 1. It contemplated:
Receipts (from present taxes) $55,-
138,000,000
Spending (mostly defense) $71,-
594,000,000
Dcfiicit (without new taxes) $16,-
456,000,000
It allocated $52,500,000,000 for "se
curity" — nearly $41,500,000,000 for
the U.S. armed forces and the rest
for such related programs as military
and economic aid to non-Communist
allies; atomic development and ci
vilian defense.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP)—President Truman sent Congress
a $71,594,000,000 "brink of war" budget today and called for a
$16,500,000,000 tax boost to put the huge preparedness program
on a pay-as-we-go basis.
Congressional reaction indicated he will get billions for defense

against Russian aggression. But his
tax and other proposals face rough
going. Some legislators accused him
oi asking his ' Fair Deal" proposals
as emergency legislation.
Record High Taxes
Federal tax rates already are near
the record high of World War II and
Mr. Truman's proposals would push
them about 30 per cent above pres
ent levels. They also would force
Congress to add several million more
persons to the tax rolls.
The program would mean bigger

levies on both individuals and cor
porations, sharply increased excise
taxes and perhaps a sales tax. Some
congressmen questioned whether the
gap between federal income and
spending can be closed without
wrecking the economy.
Higher Spending
The President disagreed. He told
a news conference defense spending
may go still higher and require a tax
increase up to $20,000,000,000 to keep
the government from plunging
deeper into the red.
He said the rate of spending prob
ably will be much higher in the next
two years when the defense buildup
hits full stride. It might reach $80,-
000.000,000 or $00,000,000,000.
