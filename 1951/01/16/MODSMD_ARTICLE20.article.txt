# Italy Gaining Fast, Farm Linquist Says
## 
### 
Italy shows more signs of getting back on its feet from the effects
of v/ar than other western European countries.
This was the report made today at Stanford by Dr. Roberto
Benaglia Sangiorgi, professor of Romanic Languages who has
returned to the campus after six months of research work in Italy,
France, Holland, and England. i

His research, which completed
work on a book on the published and
unpublished dramas of Giam Bat
tista Casti, 18th century Italian
scholar, poet, adviser —and critic— j
of kings and queens, also produced
material for a second book on the
life of Casti and possibly a third vol
ume on his correspondence.

Professor Sangiorgi is currently
offering a course in Dante .and a
course in modern drama. These
courses are open to all students
regardless of whether or not they
have a masterv of Italian.

In commenting on current condi
' tions in Italy, Dr. Sangiorgi said,
"You don't sec many scars of war
in Italy now, compared to what you
see in France, Holland, or England,
I "With reconstruction well in hand.
! the country's real troubles lie in
j overpopulation, emigration prob-
I lems, and lack of work for the great
j masses of people.
"Italian families are very large,
and the overpopulation problem
has been made worse by loss of
Italy's colonies and the fact that
the I'iiitcd Slates and other coun
tries which in the past have re
ceived large numbers of Italian
emigrants now have very small
quotas for Italian emigrants."
The Stanford scholar had praise
for Italian Premier de Gasperi, with
whom he had an interview.
"The premier, who has been under
heavy l eft Win*' attack for his pol
icy nn agrarian reforms, is doing the

host that is humanly possible under
difficult conditions," Dr. Sangiorgi
commented.
'it is impossible to hand over a
large amount of land, which is not
very fertile in the first place, to
peasants who lack tools, machin
ery, and seeds which the govern
ment cannot afford to buy for
them." he explained, pointing out
that the situation is comparable to
that in Mexico where peons could
not take care of -the land awarded
them bv the government.
Dr. Sangiorgi's book on Casti will
be pilhlished by the Laterza Pub
lishing Company in Bari, Italy, one
of Italy's largest publishing firms.

This was the report made today at Stanford by Dr. Roberto
Benaglia Sangiorgi, professor of Romanic Languages who has
returned to the campus after six months of research work in Italy,
France, Holland, and England. i

His research, which completed
work on a book on the published and
unpublished dramas of Giam Bat
tista Casti, 18th century Italian
scholar, poet, adviser —and critic— j
of kings and queens, also produced
material for a second book on the
life of Casti and possibly a third vol
ume on his correspondence.

Professor Sangiorgi is currently
offering a course in Dante .and a
course in modern drama. These
courses are open to all students
regardless of whether or not they
have a masterv of Italian.

In commenting on current condi
' tions in Italy, Dr. Sangiorgi said,
"You don't sec many scars of war
in Italy now, compared to what you
see in France, Holland, or England,
I "With reconstruction well in hand.
! the country's real troubles lie in
j overpopulation, emigration prob-
I lems, and lack of work for the great
j masses of people.
"Italian families are very large,
and the overpopulation problem
has been made worse by loss of
Italy's colonies and the fact that
the I'iiitcd Slates and other coun
tries which in the past have re
ceived large numbers of Italian
emigrants now have very small
quotas for Italian emigrants."
The Stanford scholar had praise
for Italian Premier de Gasperi, with
whom he had an interview.
"The premier, who has been under
heavy l eft Win*' attack for his pol
icy nn agrarian reforms, is doing the

host that is humanly possible under
difficult conditions," Dr. Sangiorgi
commented.
'it is impossible to hand over a
large amount of land, which is not
very fertile in the first place, to
peasants who lack tools, machin
ery, and seeds which the govern
ment cannot afford to buy for
them." he explained, pointing out
that the situation is comparable to
that in Mexico where peons could
not take care of -the land awarded
them bv the government.
Dr. Sangiorgi's book on Casti will
be pilhlished by the Laterza Pub
lishing Company in Bari, Italy, one
of Italy's largest publishing firms.
Italy shows more signs of getting back on its feet from the effects
of v/ar than other western European countries.
