# Eating Club Building Construction to Begin
## Clubs' Long Campaign Ends With $183,000 Structure 
### 
Construction is expected to begin next week on a new $183,000
home for Stanford's seven Eating Clubs, it was announced today
by President Wallace Sterling.
The clubs, a traditional part of Stanford life since 1912, will be
housed in a "L"-shaped buildinq located beside Tovon Hall and

xw J wll iiaii ajiu
across the street from Encina Hall.
Each club will have its own dining
room, kitchen and cook's quarters,
and there will he a common lounge
and storage room.
The building, of contemporary
design and rustic appearance, will
he finished in redwood on the e\-
tenior. A covered pasageway on
the front of the building will face
onto a landscaped area. There will
be adjoining parking facilities, and
driveways in the rear of the build
ing will provide easy access to the
loading area and storage room.
Construction of the building cli
maxes a four and one-half-year
study by the Inter-Club Council of
mains to erect a new home for t-he
Eating Clubs and insure preservation
of the traditional balance at Staiiford
between non-fraternity and frater
nity men.
War conditions forced closing of
the clubs in 194:5 for the duration of
the war, and two years later, the Lit
tle Quad, which housed Breakers, El
Campo, and El Torn was condemned
and removed. The other club*. Los
Arcos, El Capitan, El Cuadro, and El
Tigre, had had quarters in Encina
Commons.
The clubs resumed operations hi
but by then enrollment was
too high to permit separate dining
rooms in Encina Commons, and all
clubs have used the same dining
hall there since that time.
Despite this handicap, they have
maintained their membership and a
record of both above-average schol
arship and student leadership, it was
pointed out by Dr. Sterling.
Vance M. Brown of Palo Alto, Inv/
bidder on the contract, will build t'le
$135,000 building. Architects' fees,
landscaping, utilities, curbs, and
walks will bring the total cost to the
$183,000 figure, which does not. in
clude kitchen equipment, dishes,
utensils, and fui uttire.
Eating Club lenders hope to raise
$35,000 for this equipment. To date
their drive for funds among alumni
and students has raised $10000.
tost of the building will be homo
by the University and amortized
through long-term leases with the
Eating Clubs.

student in law, is the current chair
