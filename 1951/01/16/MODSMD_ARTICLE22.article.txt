# Summer Law Class Possible
## 
### 
Stanford, as a convenience to vet
| erans, may offer a course for begin -
j ning law students during the sum
mer of 1951.
While the course would be de
| signed primarily for veterans, who
\ must begin their law studies prior to
July 25 in order to qualify for GI
Bill of Rights benefits, it would also
be open to other beginning students,
i it was announced by Dean Carl B.
! Spaeth of the Stanford Law School.
Dean Spaeth said that a final deci
j sion as to whether the course will be
j offered will depend upon student
I interest in the proposal.
He contemplates that two of the
! regular first-year law courses would
i be offered to beginning law students
i registering at Stanford for the sum
! mer quarter, which begins June 21.
Applications and inquiries should
; be directed to the Office of the Dean.
