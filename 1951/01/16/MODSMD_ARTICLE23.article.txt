# Coeds Guilty Of Drinking in Rooms
## 
### 
Two women, a senior and a j-unior,
were put on strict social probation
by Women's Council for drinking
liquor in their rooms.
The women, who turned them
selves in, received what the Council
felt was a lenient sentence in view
of the serious nature of the offense.
The penalty was based on tho class
year with restrictions on the num
ber of late leaves allowed. Social
probation can range from no restric
tion of late leaves to complete with
drawal of all late leaves.
