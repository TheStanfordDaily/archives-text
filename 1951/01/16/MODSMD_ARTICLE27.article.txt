# A 						Sincere Rushing Program
## 
### 
The- never-ending rush for fraternity pledges
seems to increase in intensity each successive
year. And with the competition among Staf
ford's 24 fraternities comes a certain amount of
pressure on the freshmen.
How far the rushing chairmen and actives go
in applying this pressure is a problem for each
fraternity.
However fraternities might well analyze their
rushing methods as they seek large pledge
classes. The value of rushing, whether it be
eating club or fraternity, is in allowing both
actives and rushees to meet each other in a na
tural and sincere way.
Fraternities don't have to throw gala ban
quets, formal dances, and large-scale beer par
ties. Nor do the Row men have to monopolize
all the freshmen's study, sleeping, and eating
hours.
Fraternities which make the best impression
on the potential pledges are those which con
centrate on showing the first-year men what it

would be like to live "up at the house" any day
during the year.
If the house does nothing but have beer par
ties during the school year, then the rushing
program might as weil be heavily saturated
with such activity. On the other hand, if the
house is known as a 24-hour-a-day volleyball
club, or bridge club, the freshmen—for their
own good as well as that of the fraternity—
should discover this before pledge day.
Fraternities who scrape the bottoms of their
bank accounts with out-of-the-ordinary parties
are not playing ball with the freshmen. If the
house's likes .and dislikes are well-balanced—
as most of Stanford's are—there is no need to
toss a golden platter at the rushees.
Whether large or small, a pledge class which
is enthusiastic for its fraternity, can be obtained
by a sincere approach from the Greek-letter
men.
And a man who takes a pledge pin while in a
state of drunkenness isn't a good gamble for
formal pledging on Jan. 22.
