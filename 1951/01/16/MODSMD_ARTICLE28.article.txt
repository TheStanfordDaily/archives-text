## Opening Day Speech October 1,1891 
### 
- Friday is the one hundredth birthday anni
versary of Stanford's foremost educator and
!ir.tit president, David Starr Jordan. Dr. Jordan
was a teacher unexcelled, and an administrator
whose work was a cornerstone upon which our
present-day education here is built. His words
are a reflection of the great man's philosophy
and thinking. They might well be made re
quired reading for all men who come to teach
here and all students who come to study.
In his opening day address, Dr. Jordan leaves
with the University a goal, a policy, and a bless
ing. The Daily, believing that no sounder
words are to be found among the annals of the
University's history, brings to its readers this
address in four parts, each worth a few mo
ments' reflection. Without being idealistic, we
hope Dr. Jordan's # words will cause each
teacher to re-examine his purpose for teaching,
and each student to re-examine his purpose for
studying here. And may they be an inspiration
to those whose untiring work makes this Uni
versity run, and those who have learned and
graduated, and who are faced with great things
to build.
