# Ours Is the Humbler Task
## 
### 
We come together today for the first time as
teachers and students. With this relation, the
life of Leland Stanford, Junior, University be
gins. It is such personal contact of young men
and young women with scholars and investiga
tors which constitutes the life of the University.
It is for us, as teachers and as students in the
University's first year, to lay the foundations of
a school which may last as long as human
civilization. Ours is the youngest of the uni
versities, but it is heir to the wisdom of all the

ages, and with this inheritance, it has the prom
ise of a rapid and sturdy growth.
Our University has no history to fall back on;
no memories of great teachers haunt its corri
dors; in none of the rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has lived or
worked. No tender associations cling ivy-like
to its fresh, new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions; it is hampered by none. Its finger posts
all point forward. To the Twentieth Century is
carried the message of the Nineteenth. Tradi
tions and associations it is ours to make. From
our work, the future of the University will grow,
as a splendid lily from a modest bulb.
But the future, with its glories and its respon
sibilities, will be in other hands. It is ours, at the
beginning, to give the University its form, its
tendencies, its customs.
The power of precedent will cause to be re
peated, over and over again, everything we do
—our errors, as well as our wisdom. It becomes
us then, to work modestly, as under the eye of
the coming ages. We must lay the foundation
broad and firm, so as to give full support to
whatever edifice the future may build. Ours
is the humbler task, but not the least in im
portance, and our work will not be in vain, if
all that we do is done with sincerity.
As sound as the rocks from which these walls
are hewn, should be the work of every teacher
who comes within them. To the extent that this
is true, will the University be successful. Un
less its work be thus "wrought in sad sincerity,"
nothing can redeem it from failure.
In this feeling, and realizing too that only the
help we give to the men and women whose
lives we reach can justify our presence here,
we are ready to begin our work.

The power of precedent will cause to be re
peated, over and over again, everything we do
—our errors, as well as our wisdom. It becomes
us then, to work modestly, as under the eye of
the coming ages. We must lay the foundation
broad and firm, so as to give full support to
whatever edifice the future may build. Ours
is the humbler task, but not the least in im
portance, and our work will not be in vain, if
all that we do is done with sincerity.
As sound as the rocks from which these walls
are hewn, should be the work of every teacher

In this feeling, and realizing too that only the
help we give to the men and women whose
lives we reach can justify our presence here,
we are ready to begin our work.

We come together today for the first time as
teachers and students. With this relation, the
life of Leland Stanford, Junior, University be
gins. It is such personal contact of young men
and young women with scholars and investiga
tors which constitutes the life of the University.
It is for us, as teachers and as students in the
University's first year, to lay the foundations of
a school which may last as long as human
civilization. Ours is the youngest of the uni
versities, but it is heir to the wisdom of all the

ages, and with this inheritance, it has the prom
ise of a rapid and sturdy growth.
Our University has no history to fall back on;
no memories of great teachers haunt its corri
dors; in none of the rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has lived or
worked. No tender associations cling ivy-like
to its fresh, new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions; it is hampered by none. Its finger posts
all point forward. To the Twentieth Century is
carried the message of the Nineteenth. Tradi
tions and associations it is ours to make. From
our work, the future of the University will grow,
as a splendid lily from a modest bulb.
But the future, with its glories and its respon
sibilities, will be in other hands. It is ours, at the
beginning, to give the University its form, its
tendencies, its customs.
The power of precedent will cause to be re
peated, over and over again, everything we do
