# MY PRIVATE LIFE
## 
### PVT. BILL DAILEY 
I lie minute I picked up my mail that morning I felt
that all was not right with my world. From within I
heard a small voice say: "Don't open those letters, you
lnol! IJvit I lauvhed at my childish fears. "After all,"
I assured myself, "today is the day after Christmas,
December 26, 195 U. What harm could possibly occur
•in such a day as this? What harm indeed?"
'liie first envelope I opened did nothing to further
lay .'unexplainafcle fears. It contained only a late
CliiiMnias card fiom a cultural center in Los Angeles
named. "Dolly's Bowery."
In one long sentence the management wished me a
Merry Christmas, informed me that "Jeanie. the Dres
den Doll" was now once ag*in headlining their girlie
•how, and implored "would I please come by and pick
up my roommate, who had been taking up space under
a chf.'ce table since late November."
"Set, I chidtd myself, "there's nothing dangerous
in that letter. What are you so nervous about?"
The second letter I opened was a warning from
Stanford University that if I did not return my fall
quarter shower towel to the Men's Gym immedi
ately, I would not be allowed to enter the upper di
vision in Winter Quarter. Since I graduated from
Stanford in June. 1!»50, this message did not arouse
any great fear within me. I was beginning to feel
better.
But then I saw IT. Yes. IT! THE THING! It was a
long, white envelope, and it stared up at me through
its beady -little postmark. In the upper left corner were
the words "Selective Service."
'Who is this i'uy Selective Service?" I asked myself.
"Probably somebody else to whom I should have sent
a ( hiLstinas card. Maybe he's a relative of Robert

Service, who wrote "The Shooting of Dan Magrew,"
and oilier Elizabethan verses. Oh well, so I didn't
send him a card. Mayl>e he'll forget by next year.''
1 opened the envelope.
I was right. It was clearly a Christmas card, fuf at
the top of the plain white paper was the traditional
Christmas salutation: "GREETINGS." I read on.
"Why bless my soul," I exclaimed, upon closer ex
amination. "This Christmas card is from Tlje Presi
dent. Imagine The President taking time out to write
a letter to little old me who has never even heard
Margaret sing!"
And then was no denying it. This was unmistak
ably a yuletide card from Mr. Truman. It said: "The
President of the United States to William Francis!
Dailey, 4-515-28-1816 Sylvan Circle, San Leandro.
California. GREETINGS: Having submitted yourself
to a local board of your neighbors for the purpose o!
determining your availability for service in the armed
forces of the United States, you are hereby ordered to
report to . . ."
"Egad,' I shouted, "this is no Christmas card! It's a '
trap I'VE BEEN DRAFTED!"
"No. No." I cried. "Not me! They can't do this to
me! I'm a Stanford man. A Republican. They can't
do it. I won't go! Do you hear me? I won't go! I
won't. I won't. I won't!"
And as I finish writing this paragraph, an army bus
is pulling into Fort Grd, near Monterey. And who do!
you think is on it?
Oh, well. I've only myself to blame. I should have
known this was going to happen when I read that
irrivertiserncnt. How well I remember those words:
"There's a I'ort in Your Future."
