# Price Jump Creates Headaches As Consumer Digs Ever Deeper
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
When Joe Rough came back from Christmas vacation, he found
he had to dig into his levis for two extra pennies to pay bus fare to
Paly.
Suzy Coed wanted to buy a new typewriter, and they told her
at the Bookstore that the prices on metal articles had gone up.

This week Stanford students,
along wilh Americans all over the
country, were feeling the pressure of
higher prices. Coffee, meat, paper
itertis—all were costing more.
As far as food costs are concerned,
'the University is weathering the
storm," Christine Ricker, Di
rector of Dining Halls, declares. No
1 raise in board and loom is being
contemplated as the Administration
wafts to see what will happen. As
unsure as anyone what the nation's
economic future is going to be, the
persons who plan the University's
meals are eyeing climbing prices ap
prehensively but making no imme
j cliate changes in menu or buying
| policy.
Food Prices
I The sharp jump in food prices late
j last month did not have a great im-
I pact on Stanford because of the
Christmas holidays, Miss Ricker ex
plained. When egg prices shot up 20
| cents a dozen, the school had no
dorms full of students to feed. Now
j egg prices are descending because of
! government intervention.
Meat and milk prices have become
a big headache. The Associated Press
reported advances in beef from one
to six' cents a pound during the first
; week of 1951. And the Agriculture
Department predicted Tuesday that
; meat prices will go still higher in

I the next few months when consum
ers start getting fatter defense pay
( checks. Tnc Cellar reflected this cost
climb last fall when hamburgers
went up from 25 to 30 Cents.
But sharp and sudden effects of
price rises on the University's food
bills are hard to find, Miss Ricker
' explained, because of food stocks on
hand. HoweveV, replacement costs
1 lor such things as canned foods are
high.
Cellar Coffee
Five - cent Cellar coffee is now
more highly subsidized than ever,
Miss Ricker said. Laughing, she
commented that the local low-priced
brew was highly unique: five - cent
coffee is now almost extinct.
High coffee prices have caused
, Russell House to serve coffee in
I small demitasse cups. Housewives
also are being harassed by the cost
| climb: last week bag-packed coffee
was raised two ccnts a pound, fol
lowing a canned-coffee price hike
last month.
Another December price rise came
in l&cal bus fares. On Dec. 5. the cost
ot a ride in to Paly was lifted from
11 to 13 cents. Rumor predicted a
subsequent raise later this year but
no application for a fare increase has
been made, according to Worth
Prine, general manager of the Pe
ninsula Transit Company. He cited

increased operation costs as the rea
son for the tare boost.
Rising paper prices are another
probltm affecting, the Farm. Crepe
paper went up 10 per cent in Sep
tember and was hoisted another 12
per cent Dec. 1. perported stationers.
Students will feel the price increases
in notebooks and other paper sup
plies later on, as stocks are filled
with high-cost replacements.
Paper cups, spoons, napkin; —all
such equipment used by the Cellar
will become more expensive as the
government takes over paper sup
plies, Miss Ricker predicts. These
items may be hard to yet.
Metal equipment may also become
a problem, Miss Ricker said. Slv
asked students to keep this in minJ
and take care of University prop
erty.
"It would be nice if we could keep
Cellar spoons," she commented.
The Bookstore also reported price
hikes in typewriters, filing equip
ment, and oilier metal items.

I pact on Stanford because of the
Christmas holidays, Miss Ricker ex
plained. When egg prices shot up 20
| cents a dozen, the school had no
dorms full of students to feed. Now
j egg prices are descending because of
! government intervention.
Meat and milk prices have become
a big headache. The Associated Press
reported advances in beef from one
to six' cents a pound during the first
; week of 1951. And the Agriculture
Department predicted Tuesday that
; meat prices will go still higher in

I the next few months when consum
ers start getting fatter defense pay
( checks. Tnc Cellar reflected this cost
climb last fall when hamburgers
went up from 25 to 30 Cents.
But sharp and sudden effects of
price rises on the University's food
bills are hard to find, Miss Ricker
' explained, because of food stocks on
hand. HoweveV, replacement costs
1 lor such things as canned foods are
high.
Cellar Coffee
Five - cent Cellar coffee is now
more highly subsidized than ever,
Miss Ricker said. Laughing, she
commented that the local low-priced
brew was highly unique: five - cent
coffee is now almost extinct.
High coffee prices have caused
, Russell House to serve coffee in
I small demitasse cups. Housewives
also are being harassed by the cost
| climb: last week bag-packed coffee
was raised two ccnts a pound, fol
lowing a canned-coffee price hike
last month.
Another December price rise came
in l&cal bus fares. On Dec. 5. the cost
ot a ride in to Paly was lifted from
11 to 13 cents. Rumor predicted a
subsequent raise later this year but
no application for a fare increase has
been made, according to Worth
Prine, general manager of the Pe
ninsula Transit Company. He cited

increased operation costs as the rea
son for the tare boost.
Rising paper prices are another
probltm affecting, the Farm. Crepe
paper went up 10 per cent in Sep
tember and was hoisted another 12
per cent Dec. 1. perported stationers.
Students will feel the price increases
in notebooks and other paper sup
plies later on, as stocks are filled
with high-cost replacements.
Paper cups, spoons, napkin; —all
such equipment used by the Cellar
will become more expensive as the
government takes over paper sup
plies, Miss Ricker predicts. These
items may be hard to yet.
Metal equipment may also become
a problem, Miss Ricker said. Slv
asked students to keep this in minJ
and take care of University prop
erty.
"It would be nice if we could keep
Cellar spoons," she commented.
The Bookstore also reported price
hikes in typewriters, filing equip
ment, and oilier metal items.
When Joe Rough came back from Christmas vacation, he found
he had to dig into his levis for two extra pennies to pay bus fare to
Paly.
Suzy Coed wanted to buy a new typewriter, and they told her
at the Bookstore that the prices on metal articles had gone up.

This week Stanford students,
along wilh Americans all over the
country, were feeling the pressure of
higher prices. Coffee, meat, paper
itertis—all were costing more.
As far as food costs are concerned,
'the University is weathering the
storm," Christine Ricker, Di
rector of Dining Halls, declares. No
1 raise in board and loom is being
contemplated as the Administration
wafts to see what will happen. As
unsure as anyone what the nation's
economic future is going to be, the
persons who plan the University's
meals are eyeing climbing prices ap
prehensively but making no imme
j cliate changes in menu or buying
