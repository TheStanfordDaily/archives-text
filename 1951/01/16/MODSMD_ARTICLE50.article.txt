# Derek Bok Scores 22 as Phi Kaps Defeat Zetes in First Mural Game
## 
### 
The intramural basketball season
started its heavy schedule off with a
resounding bang last night as a
powerful Phi Kap five trounced the
Zetes, .58 to 26, in the Pavilion.
Dorek led the PK's to victory
with a brilliant backboard and floor
which included a few 20- and
30-foot shots. Bole, who last year
along with Phi Kap Tom Randolph
played for Dinah's Shack in the PAA
meet at the Cow Palace, scored 22
points as game high-point man. Bill
McColl was the Zetes' top scorer
with 14.
In the SAE-Beta tilt, Mike Moran
(Beta) and Bob Sanguinetti (SAE)
tied for the high - point spot at 10
each, as the SAE's out - rebounded
the Betas 38 to 29. Most of Moran's

baskets were chopped from beyond
the 10-loot mark, while Sanguinetti
tallied on hard-charging set-ups.
Theta Chi II defeated Chi Psi 11,
2G to 19.
