# Haynie-—Swimmers Third Best in Country
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
Stanford's swimming team is go
[ ing to be the third best team in the
i country this year.
That's the opinion of Tom Haynie.
i who coaches the team.
I
Haynie, who was the nation's out
| standing collegiate swimmer in 1937.
I representing Michigan, admits thai
| he has been building with an eye to
' ncxt year, '52. but the draft situation
' lias changed his plans somewhat.
Haynie figures that Yale and
j Ohio Stale will be fight'ng for the
tup spot in the meet, to be held in
late March, Imt that Stanford can
i sneak in with enough fourths and
1 fifths, plus points in both relays, to
beat the oilier teams entered.
Ohio State won the meet last year,
j paced by two sophomores, Jack
1 Taylor, who won two races, and Bill
I Sonner, who got a lirst and a sec
ond, and Bruce Harlan, who won
both diving titles. Harlan is now
coaching Stanford's divers.
Yale's varsity was second in the
NCAA last year, and in the Na
tional A A I' meet their freshman
I team took first place, beating Ohio
i State's varsity. Yale has John
j Marshall. 440-yard American rec
' ord holder; Jimmy McLane, 1948
j U.S. Olympic team member: and
Roger lladlich. ranking diver, to
lead the way.
Haynie has 12 men for the nucleus
| of his squad, plus more reserve

strcii' ( : i than lit* has ever Jiad bo
-1 tore. He plans to go after the Amer
ican mile sprinting record this
spring. Jn this event, 17 men swim
100 yards, as in a regular relay, and
i one man finishes up with the iasi 60
(yards. The record is held by Yals,
whose team averaged 54 seconds
plus per man. Stanford has 1!) swim
mers V/ho can break 55 seconds, and
Ilaynie iecls that he can average in
the low 54's. #
Counted on for points in the PCC
meet and the NCAA meet are the
lollowing swimmers, with their rec
| ords and best times.
l'ete Cole, lanky junior from San
ta Monica, is one of the best distance
fjeestylers in America, bis best race
being the 1,500 meters, metric equiv
; alent of a mile. Pete was in the
j shadow of national champion Ralph
Sala last year, but looks to he the
VVt'st's best threat to John Marshall
I and Yale's ilashy sophomores in the
longer races. His best times are 4:45
for 440 yards freestyle and 19:09 for
i 1.500 meters.
Bob Frojen, also a junior, is a
j triple-threat man, but will see most
action in the breaststroke. Coach
Haynie expects this solidly built
Southern California product to
break (>0 seconds in the 100 breast
; stroke, something only three swim
mers have ever done. Bob is a good
freestyle sprinter, and has a very
good time for the individual medley,
a race swum only in the Nationals

and the PCC. His best times are
1:01.8 for 100 breaststroke, 515 sec
onds for 100 freestyle, and 1:33 for
150-yard indivdual medley.
Bruce Putnam, a tall, blond na
tive of Redlands, is considered a
good bet to place in the NCAA 100
backstroke. Bruce started to roll at

the end of last season, ami is ex
pected to break a minute in his race
this year, along with Frojen. He is
one of the best freestyle sprinters on
the squad, and is also very good in
the individual medley. Bruce, an
other junior, has done 52.9 for the
100 freestyle, and 1:33 for the 150 in
dividual medley.
Ernie Polte, one of the few seniors
on the team, swims breaststroke and
distance freestyle. Although Ernie
has done 2:21 for a 200 breaststroke,
he may swim mostly freestyle this
season. He was third in the PCC
440 freestyle last year, behind Sala
and Cole, but ahead of USC's Wall.v
Wolf. His best times are 2:24 for the
200 breaststroke, 53 seconds for the
100 freestyle, and 2:15 for the 200-
yard freestyle.
Hobby Thompson, who swam for
Fullerton JC last spring, will carry
Stanford's hopes in the middle dis
tance freestyle races. Thompson, a
soph, has done 53 seconds for a 100-
yard freestyle, and 2:13 for 220
yards.
Bert Holiday, a soph, Chuck Kelly.
t senior, and Bob WycolY and Phil
Chapman, juniors, form the nucleus

The swimming team may host
the University of Texas in the
Stanford pools in a dual meet on
Friday, Feb. 2. Texas is paced by
Skippy Browning, who as a soph
last year took second to Bruce
Ilarlan in the NCAA diving.
The team's biff meet, the NCAA
meet, will be held at Austin, Tex
as. home of the U. of Texas, on the
last weekend of March. A tliree
dav meet, it will be Thursday, Fri
day. and Saturday, March 2!l to ,'»1.

for Haynie's excellent sprint corps.
Holiday, who can best be described
as "huge," is good for any distance
freestyle, and has a best time of 52.(1
for 100 yards. Chapman took fifth in
the PCC 100 last year; his best is 53
seconds. Kelly and Wycoff special
ize in the short 50-yard sprint. Kelly
put a blazing finish on an otherwise
uneventful season last year by tak
ing third in the PCC 50. Wycoff
showed great promise as a freshman,
but lied up in the lace of more ex
perienced competition last year.
Wycoff hit in the low 23's as a fresh
man, but he and Kelly finished last
season nearer 23.8.
Bill (ilathe, junior transfer from
New Mexico, may be Stanford's first
consistently good diver since the

war. Couched by Olympic champion
Bvuce Harlan. Glathe. who like-, tbf
10-metor (34-foot) tower better than
the springboard, is counted upon to
give Southern Cal's divers a run for
their money this year. C.lathe is Pa
cific Associat'ion champ.
Rounding out the list of probable
individual stars are Ashley Jones
and l!ob Grisemtw Jones, a quiet
young sophomore transfer from
Giendale JC, is predicted bv I laynie
to wind up the season a:? one of the
best breaststrokers in the West, il
not in the country. Griscmer, senior
sprinter, didn't swim varsity last
year, but while tuning up for the
intramurals stoppc d Haynie's watch
at 23.8 three times.

Haynie figures that Yale and

tup spot in the meet, to be held in
late March, Imt that Stanford can
i sneak in with enough fourths and
1 fifths, plus points in both relays, to

Ohio State won the meet last year,

I Sonner, who got a lirst and a sec

both diving titles. Harlan is now
coaching Stanford's divers.
Yale's varsity was second in the
NCAA last year, and in the Na

i State's varsity. Yale has John

Haynie has 12 men for the nucleus

whose team averaged 54 seconds

Ilaynie iecls that he can average in

Counted on for points in the PCC

l'ete Cole, lanky junior from San

Bruce Putnam, a tall, blond na

I
Haynie, who was the nation's out
| standing collegiate swimmer in 1937.
I representing Michigan, admits thai
| he has been building with an eye to
' ncxt year, '52. but the draft situation
' lias changed his plans somewhat.
Haynie figures that Yale and
j Ohio Stale will be fight'ng for the
tup spot in the meet, to be held in
late March, Imt that Stanford can
i sneak in with enough fourths and
1 fifths, plus points in both relays, to
beat the oilier teams entered.
Ohio State won the meet last year,
j paced by two sophomores, Jack
1 Taylor, who won two races, and Bill
I Sonner, who got a lirst and a sec

both diving titles. Harlan is now
coaching Stanford's divers.
Yale's varsity was second in the
NCAA last year, and in the Na

i State's varsity. Yale has John
j Marshall. 440-yard American rec

Haynie has 12 men for the nucleus

whose team averaged 54 seconds
plus per man. Stanford has 1!) swim
mers V/ho can break 55 seconds, and
Ilaynie iecls that he can average in

Counted on for points in the PCC

lollowing swimmers, with their rec

l'ete Cole, lanky junior from San

150-yard indivdual medley.
Bruce Putnam, a tall, blond na

good bet to place in the NCAA 100
backstroke. Bruce started to roll at

the end of last season, ami is ex

this year, along with Frojen. He is
one of the best freestyle sprinters on
the squad, and is also very good in
the individual medley. Bruce, an
other junior, has done 52.9 for the
100 freestyle, and 1:33 for the 150 in

Ernie Polte, one of the few seniors
