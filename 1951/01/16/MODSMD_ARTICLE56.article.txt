### 
Butch Boucher, captain of last
year's ski squad, whirled down the
rutted giant slalom course in two
minutes, 12.2 seconds to capure the
Class B crown at the DUO (Down
Hill Only) races last Saturday at the
Sugar Bowl. Set by Bill Klein on
the rugged Donald Duck and Eagle
runs, the mile and a quarter course
presented rough racing conditions to
the competitors after the recent
two-foot snowfall.
Irving Thalberg, the Sanfovd

i slalom specialist, toured the course
in two minues, 30 seconds to gain
fifth in the Class B races; and Stan
Pyron, the third Farm skier to'
I compete, placed fifth in the Class A
group, with a time of 2:15.2.
With the new snowfall adding
from two to five feet to the Sierra
snowpack, this coming weekend
should be an excellent opportunity
for the ski team to practice for the
coming meets with Cal, COP. Ne
vada U., and UCLA.
