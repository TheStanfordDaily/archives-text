which centered around the theme !
"The Struggle for Power, Creative j
and ' Destructive Alternatives for j
Action." Noted for his friendly man- I

a significant contribution to the I
World Student Service Fund pre- |

poor conditions of the students in his
native land.

nine other students who went to the |
conference and took part in a friend- j

The money saved at this meal was
given to WSSF to aid students
