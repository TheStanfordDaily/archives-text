## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 15 (UP) —President Truman today author
ized draft-age men to volunteer for 21 months—the same period
they would serve if they waited to be called for induction. Volun
teers formerly have had to enlist for-three years in the Army,
Navy, and Marines and four in the Air Force.

Other mobilization developments: *
1. The Defense Department an
nounced that it will ask Congress for
authority to extend for one year all
regular enlistments expiring before
June 30, 1953. It already has such
authority for enlistments expiring
before next June 30.
2. National Commander Erie
Cocke, Jr., of the American Legion, j
urged a House armed services sub- j
committee to approve the Defense\
Department's plan to combine the I
draft with a form of universal mili- I
tary training by lowering the age to ;
18 and extending the period of serv
ice to 27 months. Men 19 through 25
are now liable for 21 months' draft
service.
3. Military planners were warned
today that they may jeopardize con
gressional approval of an 18-year
old draft unless they agree to a flat
ban on sending such youths overseas
before they are 19.
4. Assistant Defense Secretary
Anna M. Rosenberg told the Senate
Preparedness Committee that few, if
any, 18-year-olds would be shipped
out of this country under the de
partment's plans. But she recalled (
Defense Secretary George C. Mar
shall's plea that Congress not tie his
hands in the matter.
