# Building Plans Go On Despite Federal Ban
## 
### 
The University will continue with
building plans for the Crothers Hall
additions and the new eating club
i building despite a recent govern
i ment ban on commercial building.
! The University will proceed on the
grounds that the buildings are not
for commercial use, byt for educa
! tion.
The federal construction ban,
which was announced Monday, puts
a halt to all commcrcial building for
! one month "for defense purposes."
Alf E. Brandin, University busi
ness manager, said that the new
| buildings here were for educational
purposes and not commercial. This
is based on the fact that revenue
collected from the students for room
[ and board in connection with the
: buildings is non-taxable because it
is all tied in with the educational
! processes.
