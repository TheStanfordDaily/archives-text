# Eating Clubs Welcome Rush-Weary Freshmen
## Toyon to Hold Open House Tonight at 7:30 in Lounge 
### 
The open house to end open houses for rush-weary roughs of
the class of '54 will get underway at 7:30 tonight in Toyon's main
lounge.
The second and final open house to be sponsored by Stanford's
eating clubs during the current rushing season, tonight's activity

may well be the last such affair toH
be held in Toyon Hall for many
years. With construction of their
long-awaited building assured yes
terday, the seven clubs will probably
hold* all future open house parties in
their new quarters.
The purpose of the open house to
night is to give those freshmen un
able to attend last Thursday's func
tion a chance to meet the men in the
clubs and to inquire about their ac
tivities.
"This does not mean we arc only
inviting those freshmen who did not
come to our first open house,"
stressed Le Kelson, president of In
terclub Council. "We hope every
man interested in any or all of the
clubs will come to the open house to
night."
Cider, doughnuts, and coffee will
be served from 7:30 until 9:30 tonight.
Following the open house, several of
the clubs will hold separate off-cam
pus parties of their own.
Some freshmen have already
pledged one of the clubs, while oth
ers have been carefully weighing the
various factors involved before com
mitting themselves to one or another
of the seven organizations. Since
there is no formal rushing period,
there is no deadline for frosh to meet
in deciding which club they will
pledge.
i All seven of the eating organiza-
I tions will be represented at the open
1 house tonight, including Los Arcos,
Breakers, El Campo, El Capitan, El
Cuadro, El Tigrc, and El Toro.
