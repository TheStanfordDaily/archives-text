# Business Ability Was Important Part of Hoover's Life on Farm
## 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
A confused American public, !
searching for some answer to
the critical world situation, last
month turned to a man who has
been prominent in world affairs
since the turn of the century.
That man is Herbert Hoover, Stan
ford's most distinguished graduate.
A traveling professor and a passion
; for geology turned Hoover's foot
j steps toward Stanford. Professor j
Swain was traveling around the
■ country in 1891 recruiting students I
for Stanford's first quarter. Hearing
that Swain was in Portland, Ore.,
j Hoover, who was also in Oregon at
the time, went, to Portland to take j
j entrance exams.
Difficulties with math and English j
I led Swain to advise Hoover to study j
J during the summer and come to j
{ Stanford early to take another exam j
' before the quarter started.
Hoover, then 16, arrived here in I
| September. He passed the math but
| flunked the English, so was accepted
j provisionally until he had mastered
j the language.
The business ability, that later was
to make him famous, supported j
Hoover through his Stanford days.
There was no tuition at the time, so
all he had to worry about was food,
clothing, and a roof over his head.
He organized a laundry delivery |
I service, managed a concert bureau ;
; which brought music to the Farm,
1 and became an assistant to Dr. Bran
; ner in the Geology Department. Geo
logical trips to the Sierra kept him
busy during tile summers.
Hoover carried his business acu- !
men into student afTairs. As the first
i ASSU treasurer, he inherited a I
$1,200 deficit when he took office in
April, 1894. By October he was able
to report the ASSU .solvent for the j
first time.
The treasurer's duties must have I
been demanding, for when Hoover
helped draw up the first ASSU con - \
stitntion, he recommended the trcas

urcr be paid a salary.
The idea was accepted, hut
throughout his tenure as treasurer,
Hoover refused to accept a salary,
because he had helped draft the con
stitution.
Though he never played. Hoover
wound up in the football hall of fame.
Hie election was due to his work in
helping to arrange the first football
game Stanford ever played.
That game, incidentally, was a Big
Game, and the first Rig Red Machine
measured a Berkeley Bear to the
tune of 14 to 10.
Stanford's first four-year graduat
ing class, the Class of '95, found
Hoover within its ranks. A geology
major, he graduated with an AB in
engineering, but that was far from
the end of his Stanford career.

Ho bccame a trustee in 1012 ami
still holds the position. Later he con
tributed funds for building the Stu
dent Union and helped raise the
money for the library which was
subsequently dedicated to him.
After his wife's death in 1944,
Hoover pave his campus home to the
University to be used by Stanford's
presidents.
Though he never returned as a stu
dent. Hoover's two sons. Herbert. Jr.,
and Allen, as well as his grandson,
Herbert Hoover 111, attended the
University.
Herbert Hoover was encaged, had
$40 in his pocket, and a diploma un
der his arm when he left Stanford.
Thirty-three years later he moved
into the White House. Today, at 7fi,
he --till helps lead the nation.
