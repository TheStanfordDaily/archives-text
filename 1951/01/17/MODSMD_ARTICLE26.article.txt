ASSU representatives on Excom spend your
money. They serve on committees to investi
gate parking problems, forum programs, and
constitution changes.
Students have won seats on the governing
body because they had the interest and ambi
tion to petition and campaign for election.
Petitioning for nomination is not something
which must be suggested and promoted by
your friends. If you desire and are eligible for
a place on Excom or on Men's or Women's
Councils, it is your privilege to circulate a
nomination blank.
Besides, there is always room on Excom for
a stiff-spined representative who can look at a
proposal in relation to its merit and content,
lather than in relation to its proponents.

Successful events or series of events like the
JlH's International Week are seldom forgotten.
The idea of concentrating on international un
derstanding during a short period of time has
been picked up by the University of California.
The program will be extended to a full month
celebration in the near future.
Cal's acceptance of our llR's program is both
a feather in the local group's cap and is indica
tive of the way American colleges strive for
progress when new ideas are introduced.

Spectator sports, rather than slow individual
sports, often find their way into the news col
umns because of the team competition which
is built up and because of the crowd reactions
which is always good copy. .
Teh kind of copy we'd hate to see newspa
pers have to carry, however, would be com
ments on the fans' booing while opposing play
ers are taking their shots from the free throw
line after unpopular decisions by referees.
Loud protests from the spectators are ex
pected as part of many athletic contests, but
in the interest of respect for both teams, it is
only fair that the jeers and cheers stop during
free throws.

Part of the color of the basketball games
comes from the appearance of both the yell
leaders and the band.
Let's hope the former doesn't miss the boat
the next time Stanford plays in Berkeley. Al
though relatively few students made the trip
last Friday night, alumni followers in the Bay
Area were surprised—and rightly so—when
the Red Dog and his four pups didn't show.
The bandstand at the end of the Pavilion was
also much too empty during the second Cal
game. We're hoping the band comes through
with its usual swing numbers and school songs
tc r the remaining local games.

sports, often find their way into the news col
umns because of the team competition which
is built up and because of the crowd reactions
which is always good copy. .
Teh kind of copy we'd hate to see newspa
pers have to carry, however, would be com
ments on the fans' booing while opposing play
ers are taking their shots from the free throw
line after unpopular decisions by referees.
Loud protests from the spectators are ex
pected as part of many athletic contests, but
in the interest of respect for both teams, it is
only fair that the jeers and cheers stop during
free throws.

Part of the color of the basketball games
comes from the appearance of both the yell
leaders and the band.
Let's hope the former doesn't miss the boat
the next time Stanford plays in Berkeley. Al
though relatively few students made the trip
last Friday night, alumni followers in the Bay
Area were surprised—and rightly so—when
the Red Dog and his four pups didn't show.
The bandstand at the end of the Pavilion was
also much too empty during the second Cal
game. We're hoping the band comes through
with its usual swing numbers and school songs
tc r the remaining local games.
ASSU representatives on Excom spend your
money. They serve on committees to investi
gate parking problems, forum programs, and
constitution changes.
Students have won seats on the governing
body because they had the interest and ambi
tion to petition and campaign for election.
Petitioning for nomination is not something
which must be suggested and promoted by
your friends. If you desire and are eligible for
a place on Excom or on Men's or Women's
Councils, it is your privilege to circulate a
nomination blank.
Besides, there is always room on Excom for
a stiff-spined representative who can look at a
proposal in relation to its merit and content,
lather than in relation to its proponents.

Successful events or series of events like the
JlH's International Week are seldom forgotten.
The idea of concentrating on international un
derstanding during a short period of time has
been picked up by the University of California.
The program will be extended to a full month
celebration in the near future.
Cal's acceptance of our llR's program is both
a feather in the local group's cap and is indica
tive of the way American colleges strive for
progress when new ideas are introduced.

Spectator sports, rather than slow individual
sports, often find their way into the news col
