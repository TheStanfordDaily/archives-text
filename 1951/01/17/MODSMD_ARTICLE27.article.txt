II â€”Our Purpose
We hope to give our students the priceless
legacy of the educated man, the power of know
ing what really is. The higher education
should bring men into direct contact with
truth. It should help free them from the dead
hands of old traditions, and to enable them to
form opinions worthy of the new evidence each
day brings before them.
An educated man should not be the slave of
the past, not a copy of men who have gone
before him. He must be in some degree the
founder of a new intellectual dynasty, for each
new thinker is a new type of man. Whatever
is true, is the truest thing in the universe, and
mental and moral strength come alike from
our contact with it. Every influence which goes
out from these walls should emphasize the
value of truth.
1 he essence of scholarship is to know some
thing which is absolutely true; to have, in the
words of Huxley, "some knowledge the cer
tainty of which no authority could add or take
away, and to which the tradition of a thousand
years is but as the hearsay of yesterday." The
scholar, as once was said by our great chemist,
Benjamin Silliman. must have faith in truth as
truth, faith that there is a power in the universe
good enough to make truth-telling safe, and
utrong enough to make truth-telling effective.
lhe personal influence of genuineness, as
embodied in the life of a teacher, is one of the

strongest moral forces which the school can
bring to its aid, for moral training comes not
mainly by precept, but by practice. We may
teach the value of truth to our students, by
showing that we value it ourselves.
In like manner, the value of right living can
be taught by right examples. In the words of
Professor Bryan, "Science knows no source of
life. The teacher is one of the accredited dele
gates of civilization. In Heine's phrase, he is a
Knight of the Holy Ghost. If virtue and integ
rity are to be propagated, they must be propa
gated by the people who possess them.
If the child world about us that we know and
love is to grow into righteous manhood and
womanhood, it must have a chance to see how
righteousness looks when it is lived. That this
may be so, what task have we but to garrison
our State with men and women? If we can do
that, if we can have in every square mile in
our country a man or woman whose total influ
ence is a civilizing power, we shall get from
our education system all that we can desire."
So we may hope that this new school will do
its part in the work of civilization, side by side
with her elder sister, the University of the State,
and in perfect harmony with every agency
which makes for right thinking and right liv
ing. The harvest is bounteous, but tools and
workmen are still all too few. For a generous
education should be the birthright of every
man and woman in America.
