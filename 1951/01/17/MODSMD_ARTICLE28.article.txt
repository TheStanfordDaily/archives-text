luiiny how you tab memo fits for future referenca.
I've -ot one put away right now that 112 know I'll use
a luL in time to come. I'd like- to have you meet the
two characters it involves.
You've probably seen these two walking around

campus together, or maybe you've
had a class with them.
Out is a dark, heavy-sit ex-
Ivlariue, whose serious mouth and
ill♦ ivj led. low toned voice tell
yon he's not an idea in his head
lor every minute of the day. He
wear?: dark glasses because lie's
quite blind ... a souvenir of
('on e ■ idor and Santo Tomas . . .

niayl.e you remember the names. But you know by
the way he carries himself that he'd be a good man
to have on your side.
'111-- other is a large, greyish white pup which might
In part Shepherd and part saint . . . the type God
must have had in mind when he let mankind go to
the dogs.
i fir.-t met the two in a philosophy class we had to
• ether. 1 used to take notes and have this guy explain
to me after class what they meant. He'd read all the
hooks I'll never heard of, which includes most of the
world literature, and he'd argue anything with
anyone. He loved to talk and trade ideas, and I loved
t > watch his dog when he got staited.
The pup would lie there, taking it all in very pa
tiently until .she decided her master had said quite
t nough. Then invariably she would let out a loud,
long-drawn yawn and simply lead him away. 1 could
never decide whether the dog had heard it all before,
or knew it all anyway, but she obviously had more
important things in mind for the two of them to do.
They're the greatest team in the world, self suflTi

cient unto themselves in a way that makes you and I
look helpless by comparison. But the most wonderfui
thing about them is that they are both such distinct
personalities. The guy very intense, voluble, very
much at the mercy of his nerves, and the dog calm and
steady, inspiring the kind of admiration and confidence
that you leel lor a good doctor.
One night we met at a professor's home for one of
those rare evenings of good conversation and better
co/lte that you liml advertised in Stanford circulars
Um.vith tlu pictures of sailboats ion Lake Lagunita.
\\ lien it came time to go. or rather the prof's wife
came in in her pajamas and asked us if she should
make another pot ol eoflee. I offered these two eh:.raf
ters a ride home.
We hadn t "one three blocks when the guy turned to
me to say that we were going the wrong way. Oi
course, I knew we weren't, but after he pointed out
in detail just where the campus lay in relation to our
course, and on what street we n;u«t be traveling, 1
thoii' ht I'd humor him and have a look at the street
sign. Yeah, he was right . . . and I've never quite
gotten over it.
I realized then that sight as well as blindness is very
much a state of mind.
I see the two very seldom nowadajra. I understand
they are going to Law School, which doesn't surprise
me. I only wish I could handle my classes the way
they can.
But I miss the sight of them, especially 011 these
bleak, wit winter days when life can look so grey . . .
what with headlines, and house bills, and homework.
But sometimes when I'm walking down Quad thinking
there must be an easier way not to earn a living, I see
them striding along side by side without a care for
the world to see. And somehow I always feel better
after that.
That s why 1 d like to have you meet them.
