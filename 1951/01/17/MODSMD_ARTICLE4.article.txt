# New Atomic Weapons
## 
### 
WASHINGTON —Joseph Volpc Jr.
suggested today that the dread H
bomb—even if it can be made —may
be less valuable to U.S. security than
new atomic weapons capable of
stopping _ Russia's huge ground
armies.
Volpe retired yesterday as general
counsel of the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission. He voiced the personal
view that "our best bet is in diversi
fication of atomic weapons"—devel
oping such things as atomic artillery
shells, guided missiles with atomic
warheads, and other variations of
existing A-bombs which could be
used tactically against enemy armies.
