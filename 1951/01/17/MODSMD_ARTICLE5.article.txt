### 
LONDONâ€”Gen. Dwlght D. Eisen
hower, commander of the new army
of democracy, said today that isola
tion was impossible for any free
country and that all must stick to
gether in a common alliance against
Soviet imperialism.
Eisenhower's statement constitut
ed an emphatic rejection of the
views of former President Herbert
Hoover and Sen. Robert A. Taft. R.,
Ohio, on limitation of America's role
in defense of freedom.
Meanwhile, Italy's Communists,
defying a stern government ban, or
dered their 2,000.000 followers to
night to hold "strong" demonstra
tions against the general tomorrow
when he arrives to discuss his new
army of democracy.
The Communist party secretariat
sent orders to Reds throughout the
country to mass for the demonstra
tions, and protest strikes were called
in Milan, Florence, and Naples.
