# Santa Clara Grid Greats Are Enrolled As Grads at Stanford
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Three Santa Clara football greats.
Vern Sterling, George House, and
Joe "The Toe" Vargas, who gave
Stanford many a rough afternoon on
the gridiron, have returned to the
Farm once again but this time to the
ciassroom.
Sterling, who won All-Coast hon
ors in 1948 and 1949 and was Players'
Selection All-American in his sen
ior year, is now a graduate student
in the School of Education as is Var
gas, whose conversion in 1949 en
abled the Broncos to come from be
hind and tie the Indians at seven all.
House, now a graduate in the De
partment of History, was one of the
finest guards in Santa Clara history
but was repeatedly held back by
various injuries.
All three of this Bronco trio played
on the Santa Clara eleven of 1948
which was the last team to beat
Oklahoma until Kentucky stopped
their ;)2 - game win streak at this
year's Sugar Bowl. It was Vargr.s
conversion which clinched the 1950
Orange Bowl contest against the
Kentucky Wildcats when he pat
Santa Clara ahead 14 to 13. Santa
Clara went on to win 21 to 13, with
Sterling and House tearing big holes
in the vaunted Wildcat line.
Sterling Came Close to Stanford
Ot the three, Sterling came the
closest to entering Stanford, and
was all set to bring with him quar
terback Billy Sheridan, tackle Tor
Spindler, and center Bill Renna.
This quartet had played together at
iVlenlo JC and were on their way to
Stanford when an entrance delay
caused a sudden switch to Santa
Clara. Renna in addition to being
an All-Coast selection at center was
also an outstanding baseballer, be
ing signed by the New York Yan
kees.
Two other prominent athletes from
other schools are boxers Julie Me
nendez and Jim Nutt from San Jose
State. These two likewise are in the
School of Education and coach on
the side at Santa Clara and San Jose
respectively.
Menendez Won Golden Gloves
In 1946 Menendez won the Na
tional Golden Gloves Championship
in the welterweight division, and as
a professional defeated Charlie Snlas
who has beaten Ike Williams, cur
rent lightweight champion.
Menendez also decisioned Charlie
Davey, who as a collegian never lost
a (ii'lit in four years and was colle
giate champion of the United States
in three different divisions.
Nutt while with the Spartans won
the 145-pound division of the Cali
lornia Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion. and was a three-year perform
er lor San Jose, which has been
rated as one ot the top five boxing
schools durh.tr the last few years.
Both Nutt and Menendez are work
ins* lor Masters' degrees.
It seems that great players have a
habit of coming back to Stanford
when its too late to do us any good

athletically. It was in 1947 that a 1
substitute halfback named Paul
Keckley took a desperation pass from
Jackie Jensen and raced over (50 j
yards to give California a last-min- |
ute 21 to 18 victory over the Indians, i
In 1949 this same Paul Keckley came j
back to haunt Stanford by enrolling !
here—as a graduate student.

Clara's greatest grid stars, has turned to Stanford for graduate
work. Winner of All-Coast honors in 1948 and 1949 and Player's
Selection A.ll-American, Vern gave the Cards more than one
rough afternoon when he played under the Bronco colors.

It seems that great players have a
habit of coming back to Stanford
when its too late to do us any good

athletically. It was in 1947 that a 1
substitute halfback named Paul
Keckley took a desperation pass from
Jackie Jensen and raced over (50 j
yards to give California a last-min- |
ute 21 to 18 victory over the Indians, i
In 1949 this same Paul Keckley came j

here—as a graduate student.


A STANFORD ROJGH NOW-—Vern Sterling, one of Santa
Clara's greatest grid stars, has turned to Stanford for graduate
work. Winner of All-Coast honors in 1948 and 1949 and Player's

which was the last team to beat
Oklahoma until Kentucky stopped
their ;)2 - game win streak at this

in the vaunted Wildcat line.
Sterling Came Close to Stanford

closest to entering Stanford, and
was all set to bring with him quar
terback Billy Sheridan, tackle Tor
Spindler, and center Bill Renna.
This quartet had played together at
iVlenlo JC and were on their way to
Stanford when an entrance delay
caused a sudden switch to Santa
Clara. Renna in addition to being
an All-Coast selection at center was
also an outstanding baseballer, be
ing signed by the New York Yan
kees.
Two other prominent athletes from
other schools are boxers Julie Me
nendez and Jim Nutt from San Jose
State. These two likewise are in the
School of Education and coach on
the side at Santa Clara and San Jose
respectively.
