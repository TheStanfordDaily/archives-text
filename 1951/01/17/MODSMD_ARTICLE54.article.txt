# Breakers Nip El Campo In a Hard-Fought Game
## 
### 
In a tight and hard-fought game,
the Breakers' blazing bucketmen !
edged out El Campo last night. 22 to I
l(i. The scoring was well distributed i
with Breaker captain Jus Capin j
sinking six to grab a tie for high |
point honors with El Campo's Bob j
Carter. The Breakers never trailed '
and although the game was a close
one, the outcome was never in doubt.
Pass, shoot, and miss seemed to be
the pattern of the game as neither
team seemed able to hit a high per- j
centage on their field goal attempts. I
The score was low, but nevertheless j
there was some fine floor play ex
hibited. The Breakers' Don Lieben-

dorler and A 1 Sieroty, who each tal
lied four points, played superbly and
greatly contributed to their team's
win.
In a faster and more free-scoring
game, Encina 4-W defeated Encina
3-E 33 to 22. Creighton Mills and
Joe Miller proved to be the pace
setters for 4-W as they tallied 11 and
nine points respectively. Despite
Dick La Framboise's eight points,
the boys from M-E were not able to
match the fast - breaking 4-W at
tack.
Ken Kelly scored 27 points to lead
the Sigma Chill's to a 46 to 36 vic
tory over the Deke ll's Monday
night.
