## Cards in Condition For Weekend at Cow Palace 
### 
Stanford's varsity cagers, fresh
from their four - point victory over
California last Saturday, held an in
formal practice yesterday in prepa
ration for their weekend Cow Palace
meetings with Santa Clara and USF.
two of the top independent Bay Area
quintets.
The Indians, who are currently
tied with UCLA for second place in
the league, will get a jump this week
on their semester school rivals, who
will be tied up in final examinations.
The team seems to be in nearly top
physical condition. High - scoring
forward Ed Tucker, who has been
slightly hampered by a sore ankle
incurred in the Penn game, is the
only Card who cannot go at full
speed throughout the entire fast
break game.
Independents Inspired
However, Coach Everett Dean
warned of Stanford overconfidence.
"The Bay Area independents usu
ally point toward Stanford and turn
in inspired performances," Dean
said.
Dean also said that he expected
Coach Bob Feerick's Santa Clara
Broncos to explode one of these
weekends, but the Card mentor
hopes, of course, that they don't get
hot against Stanford.
The Indians already have defeated
the Broncos 00 to 43 in the Stanford
Pavilion before Christmas.
Dons Remember
USF's Dons, a hot and cold team,
will oppose the Cards Saturday
night in the Cow Palace. The Dons
remember only too well the 55 to 45
pasting at the hands of Stanford two
years ago when they went on to win
the NIT at New York.
Six Stanford varsity players, most
of them from the Bay Area, went up
to San Francisco last night to attend
Hank Luisetti's basketball lor gram
mar and junior high school cagc
players. The Stanford men were Jim
Ramstead. Jim Walsh, Bill Steven
son, Ed Tucker, Dan Wilbur, and
Fritz Fenster.
