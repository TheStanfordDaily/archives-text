# Braves to Vie With Menlo JC
## 
### 
Attempting to avenge last week's
76 to 71 shellacking at the hands of
Menlo Junior College, Stanford's
Braves invade the Oak gym tonight
at 8 in a return battle.
The locals will be out to win their
fourth game. In so doing they must
stop Menlo's high - scoring guards
Roy Van Den Hueual and Bill Caras,

who racked up 18 and 15 points re
spectively in the last encounter.
Paul Johnson, the Braves' leading
scorer, has spent the past two days
in the Rest Home. It is doubtful
whether he will see action. Paul
Watson, a varsity veteran, will fill in
at Johnson's forward spot.
Stanford's starting lineup:
F—Paul Watson
I l ' —Dan Evans
('—Bill Stevenson
<;—(leorge Zaninovirli
<«—Tom DuPou!-
