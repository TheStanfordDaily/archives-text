# Stanford Freshman Leaps To Triumph With Topper
## 
### DIXIE BOOTH 
There is a good chance that a
Stanford woman may be on the U.S.
civilian jumping team at the '52
Olympics.
Marilyn Swan, Roblc freshman
from Long Beach, owns and rides
one of the top open jumpers on the
West Coast, Topper Trouble.
Last August she received an in
vitation to compete in the Zone 10
Olympic trials held in Sacramento
Sept. 12, but a burned-out engine on
the "Grapevine" north of L.A. made
the trip impossible.
"I might not have come to Stan
ford if we'd gotten to Sacramento
that night," reflects Marilyn. "I was
all set to go East with the team if I
qualified."
She'd had no trouble qualifying at
the Olympic trials in Flintridge in
1948. and besides had an outstanding
show circuit record.
At the Sacramento trials, a place

j on the 1950 jumping team was j
awarded Norma Mathews of Sacra
mento by the International Eques- |
trian Competitions Corp. The lECC i
! was organized last fall to produce a j
civilian successor to the U.S. Army !
team, disbanded after the 1948 ■
j Olympics.
j The '50 team, composed of two j
women and one man, represented I
the United States at Harrisburg, Pa.,
Madison Square Garden, and the
' Toronto Royal Winter Fair.
Shortly after Marilyn entered
Stanford fall quarter, she had her
i big (16-3) bay gelding shipped |
north, and, determined not to let j
school interfere with her jumping, ;
entered him in the $1,000 Jumper I
Championship Stake at the San 1
Francisco Grand National.
"Winning that class was one of j
the biggest thrills of my life," beams
17-year-old Marilyn. "Topper nev- ;
1 er even had a warmup—we got to J

the Cow Palace just in time to go in
the ring that Sunday night."
j Four of the 12 in the stake were
. women. Marilyn was the youngest
| and also the smallest (4 ft. 11 in.) in
j the class. After tying for first with
a horse named O'Malley, Topper
won handily in the final jumpoff.
The win skyrocketed Topper
Trouble's future Olympic standing.
During the four and a half
Marilyn has owned Topper, they
have competed in almost 500 shows,
gaining over 300 blues at the Los
Angeles National, the Los Angeles
; County Fair, San Diego Bar Oak,
Santa Barbara National, and others.
Last year the lofty jumper made
his highest mark when in competi
, tion he clcared 7Va feet. He has gone
over triple bars measuring up to 32
j feet wide.


UP AND OVER —Marilyn Swan, Roble freshman, springs over an obstacle on the back of her
prize-winning jumping horse, Topper Trouble. Marilyn and Topper have a good chance to
make the '52 Olympic jumping team.
