# Asia Revolt Used by Reds, Is Misunderstood by West
## 
### 
A revolt is sweeping the Far*
East that has been utilized and
harnessed by Russia and com-;
pletely misunderstood by the i
i United States, leaving the West
in Asia bewildered and suspect.
This was the opinion advanced by
j Dean Carl B. Spaeth, Robert Carver
I North, and Dr. Harold Fisher at their
j panel forum discussion of "Asia and
j the United States" at last night's
Tuesday Evening Series program.
The revolution is not Russian-en-
I gineered or inspired and would have
I occurred even had the Czarist regime
| not collapsed; the revolt is in part a
| manifestation of an intense Far
Eastern nationalism and the fierce
i determination of Asian masses to end
their present misery and squalor.
"But for 30 years, Russia has
studied this Far Eastern revolution
and set about to influence and har
ness the revolt to hasten a Soviet
! world," North said.
Russia Behind Reforms
"For her own Machiavellian pur- i
' poses, Russia is squarely behind what
i most Asiatics want—national inde
, pendence and social and economic'
reforms," Spaeth reported.
In our non-recognition of China,!
I our continued support of Chiang, and
our aid to France in Indo-China, the
Far East finds evidence of Western
resistance to this revolt. The West,
I has seemed to support the very evils j
\ the Far Eastern revolt is trying to j
i overcome.
; In resisting the revolt, the U.S. is [
! seeint; a Russian behind every Na- (
i tionalist.
U.S. Mistake
| "Consequently," Fisher stated,
! "Thinking Russia behind the revolt,
| we hurriedly support any anti-Red
j organization we find, regardless of its
1 politics. This gives Asians the im
| pression we are either hypocritcs or}
! liars."
"To get Asia on our side, we musl
! help Asia for Asia's sake, rather than
' just to battle Communism. We must
I apply to Asia our own principle of;
! all men created equal and endowed
j by their creator with certain inalien
; able rights," Fisher said.
