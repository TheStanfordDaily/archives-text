WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP) â€”
Defense Mohilizcr Charles E. Wil
son announced tonight that manda
tory wage-price controls will be im
posed with all possible speed, and
hifjh government sources said some
scarce items may have to be ra
tioned within months.
Wilson flashed the go - ahead on
jinti-inflation curbs with teeth in a
speech in Philadelphia as auto mak
ers said they will cut 1951 produc
tion 20 to 30 per cent below last year.
This would mean 5,600,000 to 6,400,-
000 cars and trucks compared with
8,000.000 in 1950.
In another mobilization move,
President Truman warned that
manpower controls will be ordered
into effect if necessary to carry out
the defense program. He said work
ers must be ready to go where they
are needed and employers must get
along with as few men as possible.
