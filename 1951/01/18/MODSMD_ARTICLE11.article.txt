# Rome Trip Is Tabled By Excom
## 
### 
Excom last night decided it
could not adequately discuss
sending a delegate to the Rome
Congress this April without
more facts on the Congress and
the expense.
President Ted Buttner appointed
Gil Jonas, off - campus representa
tive; Dick O'Connell, junior class
representative; and Gordon Camp
bell, senior class, to look up the facts.
The Rome Congress will meet to
discuss specific proposals for a world
government. The list of those who
will attend includes Robert Hutch
ins, James Avery Joyce, and Pandit
Nehru.
Donald E. Close, interested stu
dent, violently opposed Excom's
consideration of the sub'cct be
cause of what he termed "the ex
cessive cost." To send a delegate
from New York to the Congress
will cost $550 to $600. Close also
said that "illusionary schcmes of
world government" have no place
in the United States today. "This
is not a time to weaken our na
tionalism," he added, and said we
should not identify ourselves with
radical groups such as the Univer
sities of Chicago and California
which arc considering sending del
egates.
Dick O'Connell, newly appointed
representative, answered Close by
quoting from a speech of Stanford's
first president, David Starr Jordan.
"As sure as feudalism gave place to
nationalism, so nationalism will give
place to federalism," O'Connell said.
In regard to opening the museum,
Excom felt that most students would
like to visit the museum once—but
only once. Excom therefore recom
mended that the museum be opened
one day this quarter, if it could be
done without great expense.
Excom also discussed the failure
of the last three fall relief drives to
reach their quotas — and consensus
of opinion placed the blame on poor
organization and poor soliciting. Phil
Saeta, men's halls representative,
suggested emphasizing soliciting
within campus and Village livng
groups and ignoring those special
events which have proved failures in
the past.
Excom appropriated $90 to the
High School Day budget for Corpo
ration Yard fees, printing charges,
and other minor details; and $130 for
a new ASSU typewriter.

like to visit the museum once—but
only once. Excom therefore recom
mended that the museum be opened
one day this quarter, if it could be
done without great expense.
Excom also discussed the failure
of the last three fall relief drives to
reach their quotas — and consensus
of opinion placed the blame on poor
organization and poor soliciting. Phil
Saeta, men's halls representative,
suggested emphasizing soliciting
within campus and Village livng
groups and ignoring those special
events which have proved failures in
the past.
Excom appropriated $90 to the
High School Day budget for Corpo
ration Yard fees, printing charges,
and other minor details; and $130 for
a new ASSU typewriter.
