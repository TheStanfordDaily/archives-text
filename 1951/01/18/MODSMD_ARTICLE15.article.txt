EATING CLUBS TO-DINE IN STYLE -Here is
the proposed plan for the $183,000 home for
Stanford's seven Eatinq Clubs. The "L"-
shaped building will be located beside Toyon

Hall, across the street from Encina Hall. The
building, of contemporary design and rustic
appearance, will be finished in redwood on
the exterior. Each club will have its own din-

ing room, kitchen and cook's guarters, and
there will be a common lounge and storage
room. The clubs need to raise $25,000 more
to furnish and equip the building.
