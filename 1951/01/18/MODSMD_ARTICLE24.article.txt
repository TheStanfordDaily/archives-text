# An Artery to Korea
## 
### 
On lan. 31 a Red Cross mobile blood unit
will be on the campus. We are asked to give
our blood the easy way —to take the place of
blood that has been given in Korea the hard
v/ay.
The Army needs a minimum of 90,000 pints
of blood a month. It needs blood so badly that
Type "O" blood, which can be given to any
body, will be shipped whole to Korea the day
after Stanford students donate it. It needs blood
fjo badly that soldiers have been asked to do
nate before they go to the front so that doctors
will have enough for shock cases after the bat
tle.

The quota set for San Francisco is 300 pints a
day.
All over the country donations are falling
short of the quota set. We are asked to give
200 pints of blood. If we're frightened of a
needle, or too lazy, or if 45 minutes of our time
is too valuable—nobody will force us to give
blood. But if we don't reach this small quota
the busy mobile unit will not return. We won't
have another chance.
There are 7,415 students registered at Stan
ford this quarter —103,810 pints of blood.
Surely we can spare 200 of those pints.
