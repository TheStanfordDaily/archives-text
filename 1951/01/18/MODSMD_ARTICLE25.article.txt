## Opening Day Speech, October 1,1891 III-Greatness of Teachers 
### 
I shall not try today to give you our ideal of
what a university should be. If our work is suc
cessful, our ideals will appear in the daily life
of the school. In a school, as in a fortress, it is
not the form of the building but the strength of
the materials which determines its effective
ness. With a garrison of hearts of oak, it may
not even matter whether there be a fortress.
Whatever its form or its organization or its pre
tensions, the character of the university is fixed
by the men who teach.
"Have a university in shanties, nay in tents,"
Cardinal Newman has said, "but have great
teachers in it." The university spirit flows out
from these teachers, and its organization serves
plainly to bring them together. "The univer
sity, " to use Emerson's words, "should bring
every ray of light to its hospitable walls, that
their combined influence may set the heart of
the youth in flame."
Strong men make universities strong. A
great man never fails to leave a great mark on
every youth with whom he comes in contact.
Too much emphasis cannot be laid on this, that
the real purpose of a university organization is
to produce a university atmosphere, such an
atmosphere that gathered itself around Arnold
at Rugby, around Dollinger at Munich, around
Linnaeus at Upsala, around Werner at Freiberg,
around Agassiz at Cambridge, around Mark
Hopkins at Williamstown, around White at
■Ithaca, around all great teachers everywhere. I
. A professor to whom original investigation
js not known should have no place in a uni
versity. Men of common-place or second-hand
scholarship are of necessity men of low ideals,
however much the fact may be disguised. A
man of high ideals must be an investigator. He
must know and think for himself. Only such
pS do this can be really great as teachers.
Some day our universities will recognize
that their most important professors may be
hien who teach no classes, devoting their time

and strength wholly to advanced research.
Their presence and example will be perhaps
worth more to the student body, a hundred-fold,
than the precepts and the drill of the others.
They set high standards of thought. They help
create the university spirit without which any
college is but a grammar school of little high
pretensions.
And, above and beyond all learning is the
subtle influence of character, the impulse to
virtue and pfety which comes from men whose
lives show that virtue and piety really exist.
For the life of the most exalted, as well as the
humblest of men, there can be no nobler motto
than that inscribed by the great scholar of the
last century, over his home at Hammarby: "In
nocue Vivito; numen adest." Live blameless,
God is near.
This," said Linnaeus, "is the wisdom of my
life." Every advance which we make toward
the realization of the truth of the permanence
and imminence of law brings us nearer to Him
who is the great First Cause of all law and all
phenomena.
But while the work of teachers must make the
kernel of the University, we must rejoice that
here at Palo Alto, even the husks are beautiful.
Beauty and fitness are the great forces in edu
cation. Every object with which the young
man comes in contact leaves on it its trace.
Nothing is unimportant in the life of man, and
the least feature of our surroundings has its in
fluence, greater or less.
"There was a child went forth every day,"
Walt Whitman tells us, "and the first object that
it looked upon, that object it became." It may
be for a moment, or an hour, or "for changing
cycles of years."
The essence of civilization is exposure to hu
manizing and refining influences. "A dollar in
a University, Emerson tells us, "is worth more
than a dollar in a jail," and every dollar spent
in making a University beautiful will be repaid
with interest in enriching of the students' lives.

I shall not try today to give you our ideal of
what a university should be. If our work is suc
cessful, our ideals will appear in the daily life
of the school. In a school, as in a fortress, it is
not the form of the building but the strength of
the materials which determines its effective
ness. With a garrison of hearts of oak, it may
not even matter whether there be a fortress.
Whatever its form or its organization or its pre
tensions, the character of the university is fixed
by the men who teach.
"Have a university in shanties, nay in tents,"
Cardinal Newman has said, "but have great
teachers in it." The university spirit flows out
from these teachers, and its organization serves
plainly to bring them together. "The univer
sity, " to use Emerson's words, "should bring
every ray of light to its hospitable walls, that
their combined influence may set the heart of
the youth in flame."
Strong men make universities strong. A
great man never fails to leave a great mark on
every youth with whom he comes in contact.
