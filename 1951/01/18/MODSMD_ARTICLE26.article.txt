# MY PRIVATE LIFE
## 
### PVT. BILL DAILEY 
I am afraid "My Private Life" is going to be a short
"ne. Tuesday's column was my first; today's will be
the last at least temporarily. The reason is simple:
J the next six weeks I'm going to be too busy in basic
training to do much writing.
One thing I can do in this column for you fellows

who face the draft is give you an
idea what to expect in your new
"career."
II you are inducted into the
Army on the West Coast, you will
probably be sent to Fort Ord,
near Monterey, for four days of
"processing."
The first day you will be issued
uniforms, or at least as much of a
uniform as they can find for you.
I was lucky and received every
thing.

You will also receive an orientation lecture on Army
life, during the initial day of processing.
You will spend all of the second day taking It) classi
fication tests. The first three determine whether you
will be allowed to take the Officers' Candidate School
test later in the day.

These three tests cover arithmetic reasoning, read
ing and comprehension, and mechanical aptitude. If
you score a total of 110 points on these three quizzes,
you are given an OCS test, but not until you have
taken six or seven other exams on your knowledge of
electricity, automobile mechanics, radio, radio code,
general shop problems, and basic physics".
The third day. you learn the results of your previous
day's examination. You also get your first hint of the
branch of the Army to which you will be assigned after
basic training. Even if you pass the OCS test with
Hying colors, your chances of going to OCS are slim
at present: except in an infantry-line outfit or possibly
the artillery.
The last day of processing is spent in listening to
the Articles of War. in final preparation for moving
out to basic. Some men arc staying at Fort Old for
basic. Others are going down to Camp Roberts near
Paso Rubles or to Camp Cook at Santa Barbara.
Good advice? Heck, I don't know enough about this
racket yet to be giving any advice except the old
standards:
1. Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
2. Do your darndest to stay out of the infnntrv.
GOOD LUCK!
