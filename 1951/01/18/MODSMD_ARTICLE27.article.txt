OFF OF CUBA—We set a new record for the Yan
kee 21G miles in 24 hours. It was 24 hours of continu
ous battling with the wind, starting us we sailed the
Windward Passage by Tortugas and the .shores of
Cuba.

On the Yankee's last trip
through the passage a .squall had
lipped off her topmast, and now
wo h.iw several squalls building
up to windward. By the time the
ei;;lit-to-12 watch came on deck
it curtain-like cloud of black was
beat in«i down on us. An hour
later the squall hit, shoving our
Jet ward rail with treat force.

Bob and the Skipper had to work together to turn
.the wheel, and B<>1» muttered gratefully, "We've still
jot a topmast." The topmast and everything else held,
and we rode out the squall at full speed.
The light* of firand Cayman Island appeared off
our starlmard bow about midnight of Nov. 18. We
spent the rest of the night sailing up and down a
hundred yards from shore, wailing for the port au
thorities to come on duty.

At 7:!!0 they appeared, and we went ashore. What a
contrast this British colony is to Cap Haitien, The
house* are clean and the people ambitious. Threa
lourths ol tlie men are sea captains—active or retired.
Skipper lound an old squnre-ijgger captain who
mended our large foresail.
Cayman lias an abundance of beautiful white
beaches, clear, blue water, exotic coral reefs—and
barracudas.
It was at Cayman that I swam with my first barra
cuda. Curious rd.out an old wreck, I swam away from
the rest of the crew and dived alone around a coral
reel. 1 recognized the barracuda from his long, thin
snout, and I froze with fenrl But he didn't pay any
attention to me and didn't look so vicious, so I swam
slowly after him.
Then lie turned, ami bis narrow law, which bris
tled with nccdlc-likc teeth, <>|M>iicd and closed
rhythmically. I swam back to the ship as quickly
as I could. Near the ship I looked through the hub
bies in my wake to see if I was being charged by hii
open mouth, but there was nothing but blue still -
nesh in the water.

It was at Cayman that I swam with my first barra

the rest of the crew and dived alone around a coral
reel. 1 recognized the barracuda from his long, thin
snout, and I froze with fenrl But he didn't pay any

slowly after him.

OFF OF CUBA—We set a new record for the Yan
kee 21G miles in 24 hours. It was 24 hours of continu
ous battling with the wind, starting us we sailed the
Windward Passage by Tortugas and the .shores of
Cuba.

On the Yankee's last trip
through the passage a .squall had
lipped off her topmast, and now
wo h.iw several squalls building
up to windward. By the time the
ei;;lit-to-12 watch came on deck
it curtain-like cloud of black was
beat in«i down on us. An hour
later the squall hit, shoving our
Jet ward rail with treat force.

Bob and the Skipper had to work together to turn
.the wheel, and B<>1» muttered gratefully, "We've still
jot a topmast." The topmast and everything else held,
and we rode out the squall at full speed.
The light* of firand Cayman Island appeared off
our starlmard bow about midnight of Nov. 18. We
spent the rest of the night sailing up and down a
hundred yards from shore, wailing for the port au
thorities to come on duty.

At 7:!!0 they appeared, and we went ashore. What a
