# 'Down Memory Lane' Brings Back 'Oldies'
## 
### ROY HEMMING GEORGE BUCKLEY 
It the present movie crop isn't much to brag about, we can at
least thank the Guild and Park Theaters in Menlo lor taking some
good "oldies" out of the vaults Irom time to time.
This week the Park has on view an opus called "Down Memory
Lane." It's a compilation by Mack Sennett ol sequences from some

ol his early pictures with the Key
stone Cops, Ben Turpin, Gloria
Swanson, Bing Crosby, and W. C
Fields.
It may not be the best of the cur
rent revivals, but the Keystone Cops

can still make
your sides ache
lro m laughter
and W. C. Fields
is shown at the
peak of his form.
The Crosby
scenes may dis-

appoint some, but Bing ha? been
stcond-rate in 1950 as well as in
1932—and even second-best Crosby
is entertaining.
Actually "Down Melody Lane" is
listed as the co - feature for "The
Miniver Story"—which someone has
called MGM's biggest mistake of the
year. Such understatement!
Those of you who left the original
"Mrs. Miniver" with handkerchiefs
at your eyes will probably leave its
sequel with your handkerchiefs in a
shghtly lower position.
We can't help but hope that the

I death of Mrs. Miniver in this film
will also mean the death of that
seemingly endless parade of over
sentimental, maudlin, tear - jerking
soap-operas of which Greer Garson
| and Walter Pidgeon have unfortu
j nately become the symbols since the
success of "Mrs. Miniver."
"Movies are better than ever"—
j ugh! The Park has two answers for
that one this week.
