# Jordan Sought to Build A New Kind of University
## 
### JOY HAAS 
Just as David Starr Jordan's
j Puritan ancestors came from
Devon and London to build a
fortune in the New World, so
young Jordan left the East to
help build a new kind of uni
versity in California.
At Stanford he found freedom from :
tradition and English precedent.
Here he had an opportunity to
achieve his dream of creating a j
. school for Research, invention, and
! character building.
Dr. Jordan was born Jan. 19. 1850.
in an old brown farmhouse one mile
northeast of Gainesville, N.Y. The!
house, was left unpainted to tave !
money for the education of the Jor
i dan children. Vines grew so pro- I
fusely over the front of the house i
that Jordan used to say, "I became:
a botanist in self-defense."
Aptitude for Astronomy
He was well named Starr, for early
in life he showed a remarkable apti
tude for astronomy. While huskin/
corn on autumn evenings, he became
j curious its to the names and signifi
cance of the stars. At 13. he had com-
I pleted a series of maps of all visible
| stars, indicating their magnitudes
and the boundaries of the consteila
| tions.
A lew years alter his graduation
i from Cornell; Dr. Jordan came west
I on an assignment for the federal yov-

eminent. He was in charge of listing
the various species of fishes and other
marine animals tound in waters ad
jtcent to every post office wittnn tive
miles of the coast in California, Ore
gon, and Washington.
Later he became Professor of Zo
ology at Indiana University. In the
spring of 18IJ1, he was returning to
Bloomington from a speech-making
trip when he met a man who said.
•"Ihe governor of California is over
at the National Hotel an;l wants to
see you."
Impression of Stanford
Dr. Jordan writes that his first im
pression of Leland Stanford was "ex
tremely favorable.' The governor's
hope o! developing in California a
University where students should be
trained lor "usefulness in life" corre
sponded with Jordan's own ideas on
education.
Alter consulting his wile. Dr. Jor
dan decided to accept Stanford' of
fer to become the first president of
the University at a yearly salary of
$10,000 "despite two apparents risks":
One. that California was the most
individual of the states and still life
with discordant elements. '1 wo, the
new institution was to be "personally
conducted," its sole trustee a business
man who was active in political life.
But in Jordan's own words, "The
possibilities were so challenging to
one of my temperament that I could
not decline."
Reaction to Encina
When he reached the University in
IS!)], the Inner Quad was finished
except lor doors and windows. He
writes that Encina Hall represents,
on a large scale, a finely situated ho
tel at Silva Plana in the Swiss Erica
dine where the Stanfords once spent
a happy holiday.

Alter the opening day ceremonies
of Oct. 1, 1891, many people in Cali
fornia were surprised to learn that
Stanlord had attracted students
from all over the Lnited States. In
stead of just taking students away
from the University at Berkeley, as
was first feared, both institutions in
creased in enrollment each year.
California boosters had another
surprise when the "kidlets" from
'"Dr. Jordan's school" won the first
Big Game. 14 to 10.
.\l«de World Tours
Stanford's first president traveled
all over the world collecting scientific
data. T&day, one drawer in the Uni
versity Library card file is devoted to
Jordan's writings, which include sci
ence, theories on world peace and
government, lectures, poems, ami
fairy tales written for his children.
Dr. Jordan was an unusual com
bination ol idealism and practicality.
He recognized that, "You cannot fas
ten a $2,000 education to a 50c boy"
and that "toi the 1001, the dude, and
the shirk, the colle;o can do nothing.''
Yet, he sincerely believed that "It
i.s the noblest mission of higher edu
cation to fill the mind of youth with
noble ideals of manhood, o! woik, of
life. It should help him to be'.i ve
that love and friendship and faith
and devotion are things that really
exist and are embodied in men and
women."
