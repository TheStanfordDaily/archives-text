## Midweek Musings A 						New Popularity king for Farm Fans 
### 
Stanford basketball fans who were fortunate enough to be in the Pavilion
the night of Jan. 6 were treated to two unusual performances. The first was
enacted by the Stanford team, which defeated UCLA for the first time in
two years and eight games. The second was executed by the fans themselves
when they delivered a prolonged standing ovation for a player whom they
had seen play but twice.
The player was Ed Tucker, currently the hottest item in Coast hoop
circles. Ed has captured the imagination of local followers of the game
as perhaps no other player since Hank Luisetti.
Which is not to say that Ed's court ability is of the caliber of the fabulous
Hank's. Tucker is a very good player, but has not as yet been compared
to the all-time greats.
Nevertheless, personable Ed has become the idol of the Farm looting
section. Whether this has happened because of his cage artistry, of th£ fans'
respect for his unassuming and workmanlike manner, or the fact that Tucker
i.-J Stanlord's first Negro athlete, or because of a combination of all these
factors, Ed has undeniably fallen heir to the Farm popularity crown worn
in past years by the likes of Luisetti, Pollard, and George Yardley.
Didn't Flail to Flay Ball
Ed's career as a headline performer is of rather recent origin. When the
easy-going Oklahoman first enrolled at Compton JC two years ago. he didn't
even intend to turn out for the sport.
He had played basketball for his Haskell, Okla., high school; but, with
admission to med school his primary object, Ed planned to concentrate on
hi* college studies and get his exercise via a P.E. swimming class.
Here fate, in the foim of an eye irritation, took a hand in Tucker's—and
Stanlord's—future. Forced to drop his swimming course because of the eye
trouble, Ed decided to play the cage game instead. He was strictly an un
known quantity to the Compton coaching staff and as such was immediately
relegated to the Jayvee squad.
There he stayed for approximately half the season. Finally lie was
promoted to the varsity. But as far as playing was concerned, as Ed rue
fully puis it, ''My only chance was that someone would he injured."
Someone finally was injured, a first-string guard who wrenched his knee
just before the game with Long Beach City College to decide which school
would represent tiie West Coast in the national JC tournament in Hutchin
fon, Kansas. Ed replaced his stricken teammate, scored 2G points as Comp
ton won. He also won a permanent first-team berth that evening.
In Hutchinson Ec! continued to find the bucket with sterling regularity.
He averaged 17.5 points per game for four games in leading Compton to
third place among the nation's JC teams. And at the conclusion of the tour
ney he was awarded a position on the official Ail-American Junior College
five.
'1 luis it was that Tucker made the phenomenal jump from Jayvee to
All-American in something less than two months.
Trailing by a Foint
Ed has switched to forward at Stanford, but it hasn't impaired his aim any.
At this writing, he's one point behind UCLA's Dick Ridgeway in the race for
individual Southern Division scoring honors. He led Ridgeway after the
first week's firing; but a mere (for Ed) 12-point output at Berkeley last Fri
day dropped him behind the Bruin ace. At that. Ed's Berkeley efforts led
the Stanford scoring in one of the most humiliating Indian showings in
recent history.
Most of the Tucker points are scored on an awkward-looking one
handed push shot from iust outside the keyhole, over which Ed appears
to have perfect control, even when off-balance.
The 6 ft. 1 in., 175-pound forward developed his favorite shot while in
high school. Ed explains that he was the long-shot artist of the prep squad
and that these "long-shots" in the cramped high school gym were of neces
sity from the edge of the key. Thus it is still more natural for him to shoot
from this spot than any other on the court.
Loose Like the Goose
Probably the outstanding factor in Ed's court success, however, is his un
canny ability to relax, to "stay loose." This invaluable trait allows him to
finish a game nearly as fresh as at the start. It's also the reason for his bril
liant second-half spurts. Against UCLA, for example, Ed scored 20 of his
24 points in the final frame; last Saturday against Cal. 14 of his 21 total were
bucketed in the last half.
Ed was persuaded to attend Stanford by Farm alumnus Bill Hooper, al
though Ed will confide that "it didn't take much persuasion" after he was
granted a Stanford scholarship. The scholarship was awarded him on the
basis of his high scholastic standing at Compton.
Was he disappointed with the Farm? "Not at all," Ed says."I never
thought I'd>get the opportunity to attend a school of this caliber; and I
can't think of any I'd rather go to."
It was with the Stanford team that Ed last month attained his life-long
desire to play in Madison Square Garden. The fulfillment of his dream,
however, was somewhat marred when NYU pasted an 84 to 70 defeat on the
Cards in the Garden showing.
The Draft Winds Blow
Ed s med school prospects are rather clouded right now by the fact that
he was recently classified 1-A by his draft board. If he's allowed to return
to school next year, he'll appiy to med school at that time. A junior this year,
bt lacks a few courses necessary to immediate application.
Although an older brother is a dentist in I>os Angeles, Ed prefers a
medical career to dentistry. "I cay't think of anything more fascinating,"
is the explanation of his desire.
Ed is 20, was horn in l!):)l in Haskell. Oklahoma. He played track and
baseball with the local high school (enrollment 250) in addition to han
dling his basketball chores.
After graduating magna cum laude at the age of IG. he was visiting his
brother in Los Angeles during the ensuing summer vacation when the latter
persuaded him to stay and attend Compton.
Like the later decision to attend Stanford, "I didn't need much persuasion."
