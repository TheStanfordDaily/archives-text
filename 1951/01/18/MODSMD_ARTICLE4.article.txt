WASHINGTON. Jan. 17—Defense
Secretary George C. Marshall for
mally asked Cargress for an 18-
year-old draft today and promised
that none of the youths would be
sent into combat until they are 19
"except in a dire emergency."
In a letter accompanying the 18-
y car-old draft bill, which also would
increase the draft term from 21 to
27 months, Marshall assured Con
gress that no youth under 19 would
be s'ent overseas except on "training
duty" unless he first had four months
training.
But he added that he feared writ
ing a specific ban on sending 18-
year-olds abroad —as some Con
gressmen had demanded — would
"cripple the services in meeting a
sudden, ruthless, and violent action
by our possible enemy."
