## DAILY Sports 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
USF's up-and-down Dons, Stan
ford's opponents Saturday in the
Cow Palace, have gained national
recognition for Bay Area basketball
during the past two seasons, but as
yet have failed to show top-flight
baskctb.aU form this year.
Under their new coach, Phil Wool
pert, the Dons have compiled a me
diocre record so far this season, los
ing to such teams as California, USC,
Washington State, and St. John's,
and beating the quintets of Loyola.
Georgia Tech, Baylor, and Santa
Clara.
The Dons lost all live of last
year's starting team which repre
sented the West Coast in the NIT
at Madison Square Garden — All-
American forward Don Loffcvan,
Frank Kuzara. Don Giesen. Ross
Giudire, and Rene Herrerias.
Unfortunately, loj, the Don cause.
USF di'tw CCNY, the eventual NIT
champ, in the first round of the tour
nament last year. In 1949. USF's
Cinderella team surprised everyone
by. Capturing the NIT title.
Only lour veterens returned from
last year's team which won 19 out of
26 games—gaurds Cappy Lavin and
Milan Metikosh and forwards Frank
Sobek and Jerry Mickey;
a junior, is a master at
and an excellent floor
man. His dribbling exhibition in
USF's rout of Southern California
last year had Trov's Ail-American
forward Bill Sharinan running
around in a-daze. Sharinan, who
tried to guard Lavin. fouled out
midway in the second half, and the
Dons \yent on to win 55 to 41.
Forward Hickey, a two-year re
serve letterman. was the fourth lead
ing Don scofer- last season. The G-ft.
1-in, veteran is one'of. the few sen
iors on this year's squad, and is an
excellent rebo Cinder for his height.
One of the Don-;' top scorers this
seas:on is forward Frank Sobek. who
has a good eye with a two-handed
set shot from the side,court. Sobek.
who hails from Hammond, Indiana,
is an aggressive ball-hawk.
Guard Phil Vukicevich. a soph
omore, has beaten out veteran Mi
lan Metikosli for the Dons' second
guard position. The left - handed
Vukicevich is a good rebounder
and a steady Hoor man.
The Dons are weakest at the cen
ter position,, although they have two
eager 6-ft. 6-in. prospects in Dick

Jensen and Pat Boyle. Both men are
rapidly improving, but neither, so
far this season, has been a scoring
threat.
Experienced substitutes include
guard Milan Metikosh and forward
Walter Mehl.

TWO BODIES, SIX ARMS—Opposing centers Jim Ramstead (21) and Bill Hagler (15). plus an
unidentified Card who is practically blotted from view except for his grasping arms, are shown
battling over a second-half rebound in last Saturday's Stanford-California game. Ed Tucker (9),
the game's high scorer with 21 points, can be seen poised beneath the jumpers. Stanford won the
game, 64 to GO. Hagler and Ramstead each bucketed 13 as the Indians gained revenge for the 72
to 42 pasting handed them the previous night by the Bears.
