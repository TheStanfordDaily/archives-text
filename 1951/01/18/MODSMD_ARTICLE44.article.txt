### 
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 17 (UP) â€”
Only a group of alumni holding out
for a coach of Paul Brown's stature
today stood between Ray Eliot and
the job as head football coach at the
University of Southern California.
The Illinois coach was said to be
favored by the school's administra
tion, which wants a man who can fil
in the faculty and its pay scale as
well as be a topnotch coach.
But still on the Brown bandwagon
were a number of prominent alumni
who stubbornly maintain only the
Cleveland pro coach can restore
Southern California's gridiron pres
tige.
