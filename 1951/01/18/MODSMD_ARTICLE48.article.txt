# Roble Campus Zoo Features 'The Thing'
## 
### FLO ANN PERKINS 
The closest approximation to a
zoo at Stanford can be seen at Roble
Hall this week, where a pet show of
stuffed animals is in progress for the
benefit of the Roble scholarship
fund.
One room has been set aside for
the annual event. In it can be found
almost any kind of animal mention
able from large fuzzy teddy-bears to
little china worms. There are musi

cal animals, a pair of fleas dressed as
a bride and groom, twin monkeys,
squirrels, frogs, tigers, sleepy dogs
and cats, an abstract ceramic dog,
pigs, kangaroos, and a white, lumpy
affair, called "the thing" for lack of
a better name.
Roble women entered their stuffed
pets for five cents a head, and vot
ing takes place with pennies placed
appropriately in envelopes before
the entries. Voting is open to the
campus.
Prizes are awarded for the cutest,
most collegiate, most beautiful, larg
est, smallest, and, oddest pets. Win
ners will be announced Sunday
night at dinner, with voting closing
Sunday at noon.
