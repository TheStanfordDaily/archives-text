# Character Roles Spark 'You Touched Me' Debut
## 
### MARY LODMELL 
In true Tennessee Williams fashion, "You Touched Me" is
1 crammed with extreme character types. Any one of his plays is
■ e "big hunk" of drama to bite off.
The Stanford Players bit off the hunk, chewed it, digested it,
and presented it to a full house last night, opening night.

An enthusiastic audience chuckled
through intermission in obvious j
praise of the entire cast.
Captain Rockley was a favorite
even before he appeared on stage.
1 The audience was startled out of the
I dimly lit opening by such baccha- j
nalian braying as has probably never
! been heard in the Little Theater.
When he finally appeared, he was
exactly what the audience expected
—a blustering, slouching (congratu
lations to Hal Burdick for two hours j
of back-breaking stoop!) old sea- J
man, fantastically enamored of liq- !
I uor.
Mary Marks handled the hateful
Emmie splendidly. "Being a well
bred woman," she very decorously
vamped the prim, slow-witted Rev
erend Melton (John Brebner, com
plete with black umbrella and high,
j stiff collar), to the roaring amuse
i ment of the audience.
The romantic plot with its ups and |
downs was well interpreted by Janis j
Williams as Matilda and John Moore
in the part of Hadrian.
Miss Williams had a difficult part,
i that of the out-of-the-world, dream-
I ing girl, afraid of everything.
She didn't quite reach her audi
i cncc with her lines, but her intense
facial expressions were well under- ;
i stood.
Mr. Moore was superb. His part
was the only one not in caricature; 1

instead, he played a real human be
ing and played it. with understand
ing.
Wonderful Phoebe!
Vivian Russell spent her minutes
j on the stage butterflying and wind
milling about in her well-interpreted
part of a witless cockney maid.
A professional production, pre
sented again tonight through Satur
' day.
