# David Jordan Sought Truth
## 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
Dr. David Starr Jordan was a j
seeker of truth, but not the truth of '
a minute, a day, or a generation. He ,
sought eternal truth, truth that
would live as long as mankind lived.
When Dr. Jordan died 20 years
ago, the truth he pursued and found
did not die with him. It lives in the |
more than fi,ooo books and pam- i
phlets he wrote during, his active !
life.
During the crisis and aftermath of j
the first World War, Dr. Jordan
sought a formula lor peace. He
found (he formula, and it is as eter
nal as the truth he searched for.
A federation of nations is the road )
to peace, Dr. Jordan believed, but ;
all great nations must accept world |
government wholeheartedly. Free
dom and justice between nations is |
the purpose of a federation, and i
without them, lie believed, peace is j
impossible.
There were two systems of life for j
Dr. Jordan, the war system and the j
pcace system. The war system he j
characterized as traditionally dynas- !
tic and ruling through force and j
' conquest. The peace system he saw j
as the culmination of voluntary as- |
! sociation.

Paraphrasing Lincoln, Dr. Jordan j
j said the modern world could not en- j
dure "half-slave, half-free."
Force was not the only road block |
Dr. Jordan saw in the way of pcace. I
The myth of nationalism and a false ;
patriotism were other hazards.
The welfare of the world must j
! come before the welfare of nations, |
Dr. Jordan believed. Only then
could the individual reap the bar- 1
vest of peace and progress.
A world of nations governed by
| wisdom must come, Dr. Jordan
I wrote in 1907, "if civilization isn't to
j end in a blind sac and a pool of
blood."
Dr. Jordan's philosophy of life, his
| ideas on peace, and many of his
speeches and scientific works arc
' preserved in the Stanford Libraiv,
J which has the largest collection of
; Jordana in the world.
