The inspiration that prompted Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
to place the destiny of their young University in the hands of

of eminence among the educational institutions of the nation, his

eloguen voices raised in behalf of universal peace long before the
League of Nations came into being.
Teh indelible stamp of integrity and excellence he placed upon
the University, the direction he gave to the careers of thousands
of young mn and women seeking education, the inspiration of his
idealism upon the people of his time throughout the world consti
tute a heritage which has been and is dearly prized, and will be
prized by generations yet to come.
Upon this, the eve of the one hundredth anniversary of his birth,
in loving appreciation of his incalculable contribution to education
and the welfare of mankind, the Board of Trustr->s r ."solves that
