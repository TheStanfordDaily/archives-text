# France Supports U.S.
## 
### 
I, (> N I) O N â€” France tonight be
came the first European nation to
support the United States proposal
that Communist China be branded
an "aggressor" in Korea.
The French position became
known after Great Britain declared
that the UN has "gone the limit' in
trying to meet the Chinese Commu
nist point of view in Korea. A Brit
ish spokesman declined to say, how
ever. whether Britain would back
the American plan to label Red
China an aggressor nation.
