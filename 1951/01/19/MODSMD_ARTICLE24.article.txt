# Law School Criticizes Accreditation Plan
## 
### 
Proposals introduced Monday in
the California State Legislature to
relax the state's accreditation rulct
for law schools received unfavorable
comment here yesterday from Stan
ford Law School authorities.
The proposals, which would lower
from RO to 50 the percentage of
graduates a school must have to pass
the Stale Bar Examinations to re
main accredited, were criticized for
being "a dilution of present rules" by
a rpokesman for the Law School.
The proposed measures would al-'o
put a school "on probation" for three
years if the figure dropped helow tiie
r.O p~r cent mark, instead of imme
diate disaccrcditation which i: re
curred by the existing rules.
The con;fnsus of Stanford authori
ties was that the present rule is goo'l
and should remain in cfTect until a
bolter rule comes up. Any dilution
of the present measures of accredi
tation are definitely opposed.
One faculty member exnlained thai
the Law School was in favor of the
retention of the present rule because
'the stiict measures keep the law
schools on their toes, and operate to
work improvmcnts in the legal edu
cation in the state."
Tiie introduction of the proposal
to the state legislature comes on the
heels of the recent state bar exami
nation report which listed three
schools which are now accredited as
falling below the 00 percentage ao
cr? dit ition require inent.
Th«> report also listed Stanford .is
the leading law school in tin state in
terms of percentage of graduates pas
sing the exams. During the l.>t
thn • -y ;n period upon which the

{sccreditalion rule is l ased for this
year. 87.6 per cent of the Stanford
graduates have passed th» exam.
The University of California at
Berkeley and Southern California
were second and third on the report,
with 8.1.\ and 84.. r > per cent respec
tively. Of the 16 law schools in the
.state, only six still have the neces
sary percentage of passing graduates
to remain accredited.
