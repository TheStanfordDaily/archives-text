# Our Jordan Heritage
## 
### 
A:, v/c commemorate the 100 th birthday of
Di. Ddvid Starr Jordan, first president of Stan
ford, we can do well to consider the heritage
of integrity and high ideals which he left to
Stanford.
Setting the pace for the new-born University
in J 891. Dr. Jordan made a clear statement of
the standards which are the foundation of
Stanford. In his opening day speech, he said
We hope to give our students the priceless
legacy of the educated man. the power of
knowing what really is." This ideal remained
wilh Dr. Joidun as he led Stanford from a doubt
ful experiment to a place of eminence among
Amei ican universities.
A true leader. Dr. Jordan did not wait for
others to prove the validity of an idea, but de
veloped his own beliefs on theories old and
new. In his mind "An educated man should
not be the slave of the past, not a copy of men
who have gone before him. He must be in
some degree the founder of a new intellectual

dynasty." Dr. Jordan was such a man and he
worked to give Stanford men and women a
similar education.
The untried experiment that was Stanford in
1891 was a challenge to Dr. Jordan's adven
turous spirit. He took the chance and went on
to prove the workability of Leland Stanford's
"foolish dream" of a university to make higher
education available to young men and women
of high caliber.
He considered it the duty of learned men to
contribute their knowledge to the future, and
he did not shirk his duty.
. . If we can have in every square mile of
our country a man or woman whose total in- 1
fluence is a civilizing power, we shall get from
our education system all that we can desire."
This was the goal which Dr. Jordan worked for.
Dr. Jordan's influence is still felt on the cam- ;
pus through his suggestion of the Fundamental
Standard which has become an integral part of
Stanford life, and through the high educational
standards set during his presidency.â€”M.M.
