## Opening Day Speech, October 1,1891 IV—The Golden Age 
### 
It has been a reproach of America that for the
best cf her sons and daughters she has done
the least. She has built places lor the lunatics,
idiots, crippled, and blind, nay, even for crim
inals and paupers.
But the college students, "the young men of
sound mind and earnest purpose, the noblest
tieasures of the state," to quote the words of
President White, she has housed in "vile bar
racks." The student has no need for luxury.
Plain living has ever gone with high thinking.
But grace and fitness have an educative power
too often forgotten in this utilitarian age.
These long corridors with their stately pil
lars, these circles of waving palms, will have
their parts in the students' training, as surely
as the chemical laboratory or the seminary
room. Each stone in the quadrangle shall teach
its lesson of grace and genuineness, and this
valley of Santa Clara, the valley of holy clear
ness, shall occupy a warm place in every stu
dent's heart. Pictures of this fair region will
cling to his memory amid the figures of the
draughting room.
Ho will not forget the fine waves of our two
mountain ranges, over-arched by the soft blue
Grecian sky, nor the ancient oak trees, nor the
'gently-sloping fields, changing from vivid
green to richest yellow, as the seasons change.
The noble pillars of the gallery of art, its rich
treasures the choicest remains of the ideals of
past ages: all these, and a hundred other things
which each one will find out for himself, shall
iill his mind with bright pictures, never to be
rubbed out in the wear of life. Thus, in the char
actor of every student shall be left some im
perishable trace of the beauty of Palo Alto.
Agassiz once said, "The physical suffering
of humanity, the wants of the poor, the craving
of the hungry and the naked, appeal to the sym
pathy of every one who has a human heart.
But there are necessities which only the desti
tute student knows.
"There is a hunger and thirst which only the
highest charity can understand and relieve;
and on this solemn occasion, let me say that
every dollar given for higher education, in
whatever department of knowledge, is likely
to have greater influence on the future charac
ter of our nation than even the thousands, hun

dred thousands, and millions which we have
spent, or are spending, to raise the many to
material ease and comfort."
I need not recall to you the history of the
foundation of the Leland Stanford, Junior, Uni
versity. It had its origin in the shadow of a great
sorrow, and its purpose in the wish to satisfy
for the coming generations, the hunger and
thirst after knowledge—that underlying curi
osity—which is the best gift of God to man.
The influence of the boy to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford, Junior,
University is a tribute and a remembrance, will
never be lost in our country. To him we owe
the inspiration which led the founders to de
vote the earnings of the successful ventures of
a busy life, to the work of higher education.
Six years ago, in one of our California jour
nals, these words were used with reference to
the v/ork which we begin today: "Greater than
the achievement of lasting honor among one's
fellow-men of later generations is it to become
a loving power among them forever. It rarely
happens to one man and woman, to have both
the power and the skill to thus live after death
working and shaping beneficially in the minds
of many—not of tens, nor of hundreds, but of
thousands and tens of thousands, as the gen
erations follow on.
"Herein is the wisdom of money spent in edu
cation, that each recipient of influence becomes
in his time a center to transmit the same in
every direction, so that it multiplies forever in
geometric ratio. This power to mold unborn
generations for good, to keep one's hands
mightily on human affairs after the flesh has
been dust for years seems not only more than
mortal, but more than man. Thus does man be
come co-worker with God' in shaping the shap
ing of the world to a gooo outcome."
The Golden Age of California begins when
its gold is used for purposes like this. From
such deeds must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the California of the
gold seeker and the adventurer, but the abode
of high minded men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages and imbued with the love of
nature, the love of man. and the love of God,
and bright indeed will be the future of our
State, if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders shall
be realized.

State, if, in the usefulness of the University,

It has been a reproach of America that for the
best cf her sons and daughters she has done
the least. She has built places lor the lunatics,
idiots, crippled, and blind, nay, even for crim
inals and paupers.
But the college students, "the young men of
sound mind and earnest purpose, the noblest
tieasures of the state," to quote the words of
President White, she has housed in "vile bar
racks." The student has no need for luxury.
Plain living has ever gone with high thinking.
But grace and fitness have an educative power
too often forgotten in this utilitarian age.
These long corridors with their stately pil
lars, these circles of waving palms, will have
their parts in the students' training, as surely
as the chemical laboratory or the seminary
room. Each stone in the quadrangle shall teach
its lesson of grace and genuineness, and this
valley of Santa Clara, the valley of holy clear
ness, shall occupy a warm place in every stu
dent's heart. Pictures of this fair region will
cling to his memory amid the figures of the
draughting room.
Ho will not forget the fine waves of our two
mountain ranges, over-arched by the soft blue
Grecian sky, nor the ancient oak trees, nor the
'gently-sloping fields, changing from vivid
green to richest yellow, as the seasons change.
The noble pillars of the gallery of art, its rich
treasures the choicest remains of the ideals of
past ages: all these, and a hundred other things
which each one will find out for himself, shall
iill his mind with bright pictures, never to be
rubbed out in the wear of life. Thus, in the char
actor of every student shall be left some im
perishable trace of the beauty of Palo Alto.
Agassiz once said, "The physical suffering
of humanity, the wants of the poor, the craving
of the hungry and the naked, appeal to the sym
pathy of every one who has a human heart.
But there are necessities which only the desti
tute student knows.
"There is a hunger and thirst which only the
highest charity can understand and relieve;
and on this solemn occasion, let me say that
every dollar given for higher education, in
whatever department of knowledge, is likely
to have greater influence on the future charac
ter of our nation than even the thousands, hun

dred thousands, and millions which we have
spent, or are spending, to raise the many to
material ease and comfort."
I need not recall to you the history of the
foundation of the Leland Stanford, Junior, Uni
versity. It had its origin in the shadow of a great
sorrow, and its purpose in the wish to satisfy
for the coming generations, the hunger and
thirst after knowledge—that underlying curi
osity—which is the best gift of God to man.
The influence of the boy to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford, Junior,
University is a tribute and a remembrance, will
never be lost in our country. To him we owe
the inspiration which led the founders to de
vote the earnings of the successful ventures of
a busy life, to the work of higher education.
Six years ago, in one of our California jour
nals, these words were used with reference to
the v/ork which we begin today: "Greater than
the achievement of lasting honor among one's
fellow-men of later generations is it to become
a loving power among them forever. It rarely
happens to one man and woman, to have both
the power and the skill to thus live after death
working and shaping beneficially in the minds
of many—not of tens, nor of hundreds, but of
thousands and tens of thousands, as the gen
erations follow on.
"Herein is the wisdom of money spent in edu
cation, that each recipient of influence becomes
in his time a center to transmit the same in
every direction, so that it multiplies forever in
geometric ratio. This power to mold unborn
generations for good, to keep one's hands
mightily on human affairs after the flesh has
been dust for years seems not only more than
mortal, but more than man. Thus does man be
come co-worker with God' in shaping the shap
ing of the world to a gooo outcome."
The Golden Age of California begins when
its gold is used for purposes like this. From
such deeds must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the California of the
gold seeker and the adventurer, but the abode
of high minded men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages and imbued with the love of

wisdom of the ages and imbued with the love of
nature, the love of man. and the love of God,
and bright indeed will be the future of our
State, if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders shall
be realized.
It has been a reproach of America that for the
best cf her sons and daughters she has done
the least. She has built places lor the lunatics,
idiots, crippled, and blind, nay, even for crim
inals and paupers.
But the college students, "the young men of
sound mind and earnest purpose, the noblest
tieasures of the state," to quote the words of
President White, she has housed in "vile bar
racks." The student has no need for luxury.
Plain living has ever gone with high thinking.
But grace and fitness have an educative power
too often forgotten in this utilitarian age.
These long corridors with their stately pil
lars, these circles of waving palms, will have
their parts in the students' training, as surely
as the chemical laboratory or the seminary
room. Each stone in the quadrangle shall teach
its lesson of grace and genuineness, and this
valley of Santa Clara, the valley of holy clear
ness, shall occupy a warm place in every stu
dent's heart. Pictures of this fair region will
cling to his memory amid the figures of the
draughting room.
Ho will not forget the fine waves of our two
mountain ranges, over-arched by the soft blue
Grecian sky, nor the ancient oak trees, nor the
'gently-sloping fields, changing from vivid
green to richest yellow, as the seasons change.
The noble pillars of the gallery of art, its rich
treasures the choicest remains of the ideals of
past ages: all these, and a hundred other things
which each one will find out for himself, shall
iill his mind with bright pictures, never to be
rubbed out in the wear of life. Thus, in the char
actor of every student shall be left some im
perishable trace of the beauty of Palo Alto.
Agassiz once said, "The physical suffering
of humanity, the wants of the poor, the craving
of the hungry and the naked, appeal to the sym
pathy of every one who has a human heart.
But there are necessities which only the desti
tute student knows.
"There is a hunger and thirst which only the
highest charity can understand and relieve;
and on this solemn occasion, let me say that
every dollar given for higher education, in
whatever department of knowledge, is likely
to have greater influence on the future charac
ter of our nation than even the thousands, hun

dred thousands, and millions which we have
spent, or are spending, to raise the many to
material ease and comfort."
I need not recall to you the history of the
foundation of the Leland Stanford, Junior, Uni
versity. It had its origin in the shadow of a great
sorrow, and its purpose in the wish to satisfy
for the coming generations, the hunger and
thirst after knowledge—that underlying curi
osity—which is the best gift of God to man.
The influence of the boy to the nobility of
whose short life the Leland Stanford, Junior,
University is a tribute and a remembrance, will
never be lost in our country. To him we owe
the inspiration which led the founders to de
vote the earnings of the successful ventures of
a busy life, to the work of higher education.
Six years ago, in one of our California jour
nals, these words were used with reference to
the v/ork which we begin today: "Greater than
the achievement of lasting honor among one's
fellow-men of later generations is it to become
a loving power among them forever. It rarely
happens to one man and woman, to have both
the power and the skill to thus live after death
working and shaping beneficially in the minds
of many—not of tens, nor of hundreds, but of
thousands and tens of thousands, as the gen
erations follow on.
"Herein is the wisdom of money spent in edu
cation, that each recipient of influence becomes
in his time a center to transmit the same in
every direction, so that it multiplies forever in
geometric ratio. This power to mold unborn
generations for good, to keep one's hands
mightily on human affairs after the flesh has
been dust for years seems not only more than
mortal, but more than man. Thus does man be
come co-worker with God' in shaping the shap
ing of the world to a gooo outcome."
The Golden Age of California begins when
its gold is used for purposes like this. From
such deeds must rise the new California of the
coming century, no longer the California of the
gold seeker and the adventurer, but the abode
of high minded men and women, trained in the
wisdom of the ages and imbued with the love of
nature, the love of man. and the love of God,
and bright indeed will be the future of our
State, if, in the usefulness of the University,
every hope and prayer of the founders shall
be realized.
