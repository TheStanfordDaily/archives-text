Our (.utic Team Is a Dark ttorsr
Before our basketball team played it- first i>ame, we prophetically nu
nc, u need (with a Llaie of trumpets in the background), "Tab the Indians as
a d?rk horse!'' We said it not becau.-e we wholeheartedly believed it;
t:ill for the reason that if you can't say a team should be favored ft>i a
championship, you can always call it a dark horse.
But, lo and'behold, the Deanmen are just that. A dark horse. After four
names in Southern Division competition, they stand a chance (admittedly
an outside chance, but still a chance) of copping the gonfalon.
Most (including me) thought that the loss of the magnificent George
Yardloy would be too much of a handicap to overcome, but then most people
cijdn t realize that Ed Tucker would come through the way he has. And
i :osl didn't consider that last year's unpredictable sophomores would be
come this year's steady juniors- Ramstead, lversen, Walsh.
['lie problem of reserves of course is a headache. A fasi break attack
iiei ds good substitutes. Hut the replacement of tiring regulars Gary An
drews Paul Watson, and Paul Johnson miglil solve the problem. Watson,
although be hasn't seen as much action as be did at the beginning of the
season, is ideal lor the last break. His speed, accuracy in shooting, and
guarding abilit > makes him valuable iu any championship plans Stanford
ought entertain.
I he Indians have had a serious ploblem insular as condition is concerned,
it )io secret that the eastern swing was physically enervating. Just yester
('■•y, ( oacli Everett Dean told us. "The Stanford basketball team is slowly
recovering Irom its Eastern jaunt. Immediately upon returning home they
were i idled upon to lace one ol their toughest opponents in the UCLA
iiiiiin . At that time the team was weak and under par physically, which
made iheir showing against the Bruins all the more outstanding. Those two
mes were the fastest played in the Pavilion in the memory of local fans,
'1 hi.» playei's lon ol their weary condition and punished themselves to make
. i'. editable showing to open the Conference .season. The coaches are proud
••! ! heir performance to date."
( .i .inlod the only consistent thing about our club has been their iiicon-
M.slency in winning, they slill have shown eye-pleasing potential. And
it the\ can play like they did against Cul on Saturday, they might p«»s
sibl>—. Well, as we say they're a dark horse.
Shades of Jack licnuy
We don't know il Jack Benny gives out the rules to the gatekeepers at ath
i< lie events, but il he did we couldn't he any more pinch-penny than we
• t re now. Consider these examples:
H;»nk Luisetti was Stanford's iinest all-time athlete. Many consider him
l}u greatest basketball player ever to put two feet on the hardwood. And
yel Luisetti went to a game at the Pavilion last year, and he had to pay
t . get in!
Want more? Okay, remember Harry Wolter? He was Stanford's baseball
coach for a number of years. The venerable and distinguished Wolter was
respected by all, so respected that two years ago when lie retired they held
a "day lor him. They set aside a game at the Sunken Diamond, and they
calln! it llarry Wolter Day.' Last year, Wolter went to the Diamond to see
lii old team in action. He had to pay to get in.
Ibis reminds us of an incident that John Hall. Bull Sessioner and good
guy brought out last year. A gentleman brought his infant son to a base
ball game last year, and he had to pay the regular price for (he baby.
Now the baby didn't know the difference between a baseball and A 1 Mas
ter,' noggin and probably wouldn't for a few years to come, and still his
lather had to whip out a few shekels for him!
t . ,e not reusing the gatekeepers. They get their orders from someone
riighi r up, and whoever it is who gives those orders could teach Jack Bennv
a lew things about penny-pinching.
I U Cck's Wash Dent.
Jim Ramstead and Tom DuFour, who engage in a sport which requires
virtual jumps into the stratosphere, found that the stratosphere didn't quite
jß'iee with them on the trip east; thus, when the plane stopped for 20 min
utes at Omaha, Rammer and Tom decided to get out and get something to
cut. To ease the butterflies.
Later, when the plane started taxiing for the take-off the stewardess
| l: w ' lelV are those two sick-looking boys who were on the plane
■efore. Lho e two sick-looking boys" were in the control booth fran
tically trying to get the operator to tell that consarned pilot to stop that con
traption. Gosh and gee, they didn't want to be left behind.
The jtory ended happily as the pilot discovered that his plane was two
basket hull players light, and he went back and picked up the now sicker
tlian-ever Ramstead and DuFour.
FI'NMFST SIGHT ON THE TRIP—The most amusing thing to the bas
. . s wa.snt one of the Broadway shows they saw or any other of the
"<t-,.ties—hut the sight of George Zaninovieh sticking half his body out of
; moving I us. looking up at the skyscrapers.
11 was all quite new to George, who comes from the tmvn of Delano,
where the chickens and roosters outnumber the people and where the
highest object is the lightning rod on the top of Farmer Brow n's barn

Connie Jarvis, Stanford s amiable trainer, was expounding on the psycho-

Using the platoon system as n example, Jarvis said. "Now when our boys
Mr 'an into the platoon system against Army in 19-18 and Michigan in '47
it lad tremendous psychological effect. Why, when those Army and Michi
yan boys jumped oft the bench when the ball changed hands, it looked like
mere were three men coming on for every position."
