Showing surprising strength, the
San Jose matmcn put a stranglehold
on the Indians last night and*won a
sweeping 2(5 to (i victory.
Even Stanford's o u t s t a n d in g
heavyweight, Sieve Garst, who had
not lost ;i match in two years, fell
before the onslaught and was deei
sioncd by Jean Snyder .'5 to 0.
Only two Indians to survive the
avalanche were Ted Hariton, in
the 137 - pound class, and Dick
Price in the 147. Hariton deci
sioned Lou Calvetti 15 to (I, and
Price took Bill Wardrup by the
same score to earn the Cards their
only points of the evening.
Stanford had to forfeit the 1 .'JO—
pound Match, although Oliver
Lyons, a freshman, put on an exhi
bition with San Jose's Bennie Ichi
kawa. Ichikawa. third ranked in his
class on the coast, was decisioned by-
Lyons, who is an outstanding pros
pect for next year's varsity.
In the 107-pound class, Indian Don
Williams wrestled the Spartan co
captain, who had a 15-pound weight
advantage. Williams forged ahead
on points, but his disadvantage in

weight began to tell late in the match
and he was pinned by Jordan.
At the 123 - pound level David
Wong was pinned by K. Toyota, and
at 157 pounds Felix Knauth fell be
fore Frank Waxham.
Gaining some measure of re
venge for the varsity defeat, the
Card JV - I'rosli combination won
an unexpected 18 to 13 victory
over the Spartan freshmen.
Especially promising were George
Russell, who pinned Ko Nagarada in
the 137-pound class; Lloyd Feitus,
147 pounds, who defeated Gerald
Boyd: Kenny James, 167 pounds,
who gained a decision over Claude
Bolender; and Rod Garner, heavy
weight. who was impressive in pin
ning Dale Maynard.
Injuries proved costly to the In
dians, as neither Dick DeWitt nor
Rollin Rose was able to wrestle for
the varsity. This resulted in the shilt
which necessitated Don Williams
wrestling in a class above his weight,
and Felix Knauth substituting for
Rose.
Next week Stanford meets the
Olympic Club here on the Farm.
And on Jan. 31 there will be a re
match with the San Jose Spartans.

Card JV - I'rosli combination won
an unexpected 18 to 13 victory
over the Spartan freshmen.
Especially promising were George
Russell, who pinned Ko Nagarada in
the 137-pound class; Lloyd Feitus,
147 pounds, who defeated Gerald
Boyd: Kenny James, 167 pounds,
who gained a decision over Claude
Bolender; and Rod Garner, heavy
weight. who was impressive in pin
ning Dale Maynard.
Injuries proved costly to the In
dians, as neither Dick DeWitt nor
Rollin Rose was able to wrestle for
the varsity. This resulted in the shilt
which necessitated Don Williams
wrestling in a class above his weight,
and Felix Knauth substituting for
Rose.
Next week Stanford meets the
Olympic Club here on the Farm.
And on Jan. 31 there will be a re
match with the San Jose Spartans.
