# Second Haft Spurt Routs Menlo 65-46
## 
### 
| Stanford's Braves, shooting as
; though they owned the baskets,
I routed Menlo Junior College 65 to 46
Wednesday night in the Oaks' gym.
Dan Evans paced the Stanford
j bucket brigade by pouring through
18 points, (ieorge Zaninovich fol
! lowed with 12.
At the outset the lead see-sawed,
and the Braves left the court at hall
, time with a scant two-point, 28 to 26
i lead.
Following the intermission, FriU
Fenster and Paul Watson started hit
ting the hoop and the locals picked
up a commanding lead.
In Menlo's worst defeat of the
current campaign, the only bright
spot of the evening for the Oaks
was the shooting of forward Carlos
Bea, who scored 18 points to tie for
hiuh scoring honors with Evaus.
Stanford's win evened the two
game series with the Oaks and
i avenged last week's 76 to 71 defeat
I at their hands.
The Braves will rest on the laurels
of their four-win, three-loss record,
|at least for this weekend. On tap
lor the middle of next week is a go
I against the Indian frosh, which could
i prove very interesting.
