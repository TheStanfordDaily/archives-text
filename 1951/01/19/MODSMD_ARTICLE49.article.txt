, undeleted Ireshman basketballers,
jits Galileo Hi. and Galileo romps
onto-the Pavilion at *2:150 p.m. today
to try to do what no team has done
yet—beat the Papooses.
i Monterey will provide competi
tion for the yearlings here at 2 p.m.
tomorrow.
; Galileo has compiled an excellent
I record thus iar, and it boasts an out
; standing player in center Don Bragg.
Sid Phclan, Washington High
Coach, said. "He is the best opera
tor the league has seen in modern
times, and (hat includes Jim Itam
steail, Ken Flower, Giiio (imoni,
and the whole winks."
Bragg s coach, Tom DeNike, said,
; "He is the closest approach to Hank
Luisetti 1 have ever seen."
The Card babes, fresh from a twin
killing ol Cal, will' be at greater
strength than they were last week.
Dave Epperson, the elongated cen
ter, has won his light with the flu
bug and is all set to give the visitors
I from the city a dose of his deadly
; hook shots.
Tom Green, a siv - foot guard,
lias definitely shown thai he is the
number six man on the team.
Coach Bob Burnett described
Green as a hoopster "who is ex
cellent on the back board, a good
long shot, and a good man in the
fast break.
The starting lineup remains Hal
Ellis and Don DeLong at forwards.
Epperson at center, and Ollie Suzda
lefl and Don Carlson at guards.
Carlson filled in for Epperson at
j center last week, but now is back at
I his old guard spot.
j Others who are sure to see action
: are forwards Sam Morley and Kay
Swarts and guard Marshall Free
; man.
I The Cal series showed that Suz
' daleff was a come - through per
former. With Epperson missing
and Carlson out part of the time
with an injury, little Ollie took
command of things and scored .'55
points in the two games.
Ellis also sparkled in the Cal tift's,
and should carry a large load of the
I scoring punch today.
