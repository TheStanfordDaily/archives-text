# Cards Seek Double Victory Against Local Opponents
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Coach Everett Dean's red
shirted varsity carjers, led by
iheir newly elected captain Jack
O'Sullivan, will invade San
Francisco's Cow Palace tonight
and tomorrow night for games
with tv/o of the top Bay Area
guintets, Santa Clara and USF.
Starting time is 9:15.
The high-scoring Indians, who will
not return to conference play until

the sfecond week in February, will
oppose Santa Clara's much - im
proved Broncos tonight, and then
; return tomorrow night to meet
USF's ball-hawking Dons.
The Broncos, who were beaten by

the Cards (»o to 43 last December,
created a minor upset Wednesday
nis;ht when tliey beat a highly re
garded College of Pacific live ($2 to
60. Under their new coach, former
all - pro center Bub Ferrick, Santa
Clara has been improving all season
and could conceivably turn the
tables on Stanford's fast - breaking
sharpshooters.
Furoue Is Sharp
The deadeye of the dangerous
Bronco quintet is left-handed Frank
F;Vone, a 5-ft. 10-in. guard who
went on a 14 - point scoring spree
against the Cards' in the Broncos'
first outing. Most of Farone's buck
ets were from way out.
Six - foot four - inch center Jack
Nalty possibly is the mo&t improved
player on the Santa Clara squad. A
good defensive man, Nalty lias beer
perfecting his deadly hook shot, all
season, and might give the Cards

There will lie an important
meeting of all students out for
golf on Tuesday iri ihe pro shop
on the golf course at 5:15 p.m.

plenty ol trouble on the pivot post.
Other Bronco starters will in
. elude veteran forwards Andy Col
lins and Bob Peters and rugged
, guard Tom Guerin.
Cards After Revenge
USF, always a thorn in the side of
the Indians, will present its weakest
team in the past three years, and the
Cards will be out to avenge last
| year's drubbing at the hands of the
i Dons.
The Hilltoppers, however, are
fairly well balanced in having all
five starters as practically equal
scoring threats.
Coach Everett Dean announced
j yesterday that he would start the
same lineup that opened last week's
games aaginst California — forwards
Jack O'Sullivan and Ed Tucker, cen-
I ter Jim Ramstead, and guards Jirn
