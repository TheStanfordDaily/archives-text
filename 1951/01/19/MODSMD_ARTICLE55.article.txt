# Farm ACLU Forum Discusses State Loyalty Oath Problems
## 
### HOLBROOK TETER 
"The chances of this nation ;
avoiding falling under Commu
nist slavery are less than 50-
50." With this opinion, Dr. ,
Abram V. Martin of San Jose,
defended the state loyalty oath
at a forum sponsored by the
Stanford chapter of the Ameri-;
can Civil Liberties Union held in I
the Women's Clubhouse Wed-!
nesday night.
"Unless you're willing to com-!
promise on some of the freedoms." !
Dr. Martin continued, "you won't be
able to preserve any of them." He ;
cited the draft as a serious curtail- [
ment of liberty in the interests of the (
nation.
His views were opposed by Herbert
Blau of San Francisco State and Dr.
A. Eason Monroe, who was recently !
removed from his position as chair- j
man of the Division of Language Arts
at Sati Francisco State because he
would not sign the oath.
Dr. Monroe said that "we do not
compel loyalty, we earn it. The law !
(The Levering Act) does not advance
security."
In fact, Dr. Monroe maintained, it i
has four bad effects. It tears the base :
from under teacher tenure; it estab
lishes a "quasi-military control" I
over state employees; "it invites in- I
timidation and fear in public em
ployees"; and finally, it lays the basis j
for further legislation of the same 1
kind.
Both Dr. Monroe and Blau ob
jected to the Levering Act on the

basis that it is a "conspiracy" against
freedom of speech. The second para
graph of the oath, against which their
objections were particularly directed,
reads as follows:
"And I do further swear (or af
firm) that I do not advocate, nor am
I a member of any party or organi
sation, political or otherwise, that
now advocates the overthrow of
the Government of the United
States or of the State of California
by force or violence or other un
lawful means; that within the five
years immediately preceding the
taking of this oath (or affirmation)
I have not. been a member of any
party or organization, political or
otherwise, that advocated the ov
erthrow of the Government of the
United States or of the State of
California by force or violence or
other unlawful means except as
follows: (List names) and that
during such, time as I am a mem

ber or employee of the (name of
public agcncy) I will not advocate i
nor become a member of any party
or organization, political or other- ;
wise, that advocates the overthrow
of the Government of the United !
States or of the State of California
by force or violence or other un
lawful means."
Blau. who signed the oath, said he
did so because he felt he could ac- !
complish more by continuing his ;
teaching. By doing this he would be i
treating "the general disease." which
is apathy—especially of the students.;
The average student knows little |
about the act, and cares less, Blau '
stated. The average student "could
not defend capitalistic democracy
(and) doesn't believe anything."
Dr. Paul Kirkpatrick moderated
the discussion period which followed
the forum. Nancy Lupher, president
of the Stanford ACLU, opened and
closed the meeting.

FORUM SPEAKERS —"The Levering Act: Pro and Con" was the subject of discussion Wednes
day night by Professor Abram V. Martin (left), San Jose State; Dr. A. Eason Monroe; Dr. Paul
Kirkpatrick of Stanford, moderator; and Herbert Blau, San Francisco State. The discussion was
sponsored by the Stanford chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
"The chances of this nation ;
avoiding falling under Commu
nist slavery are less than 50-
50." With this opinion, Dr. ,
Abram V. Martin of San Jose,
defended the state loyalty oath
at a forum sponsored by the
Stanford chapter of the Ameri-;
can Civil Liberties Union held in I
the Women's Clubhouse Wed-!
nesday night.
"Unless you're willing to com-!
promise on some of the freedoms." !
Dr. Martin continued, "you won't be
able to preserve any of them." He ;
cited the draft as a serious curtail- [
ment of liberty in the interests of the (
nation.
His views were opposed by Herbert
Blau of San Francisco State and Dr.
A. Eason Monroe, who was recently !
removed from his position as chair- j
man of the Division of Language Arts
at Sati Francisco State because he
would not sign the oath.
Dr. Monroe said that "we do not
compel loyalty, we earn it. The law !
(The Levering Act) does not advance
security."
In fact, Dr. Monroe maintained, it i
has four bad effects. It tears the base :
from under teacher tenure; it estab
lishes a "quasi-military control" I
over state employees; "it invites in- I
timidation and fear in public em
ployees"; and finally, it lays the basis j
for further legislation of the same 1
kind.
Both Dr. Monroe and Blau ob
jected to the Levering Act on the

basis that it is a "conspiracy" against
freedom of speech. The second para
graph of the oath, against which their
objections were particularly directed,
reads as follows:
"And I do further swear (or af
firm) that I do not advocate, nor am
I a member of any party or organi
sation, political or otherwise, that
now advocates the overthrow of
the Government of the United
States or of the State of California
by force or violence or other un
lawful means; that within the five
years immediately preceding the
taking of this oath (or affirmation)
I have not. been a member of any
party or organization, political or
otherwise, that advocated the ov
erthrow of the Government of the
United States or of the State of
California by force or violence or
other unlawful means except as
follows: (List names) and that
during such, time as I am a mem

ber or employee of the (name of
public agcncy) I will not advocate i
nor become a member of any party
or organization, political or other- ;
wise, that advocates the overthrow
of the Government of the United !
States or of the State of California
by force or violence or other un
lawful means."
Blau. who signed the oath, said he
did so because he felt he could ac- !
complish more by continuing his ;
teaching. By doing this he would be i
treating "the general disease." which
is apathy—especially of the students.;
The average student knows little |
about the act, and cares less, Blau '
stated. The average student "could
not defend capitalistic democracy
(and) doesn't believe anything."
