# Lower Division Requirements Revised; 1st Change in 30 Years
## 
### 
The first major revision of Stan
ford's lower division curriculum in
30 years is expccted to be presented
before the Faculty Acadsmic Council
by the end of winter quarter.
The new program which is the re
sult of two and one-half years of
study and preparation by the Lower
Division Committee at Stanford will
reformulate the lower division re
quirements to render them more ef
fective in giving each Stanford stu
dent a basic general education in his
first two years, according to Clarence
H. Faust, Dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences and co-chair
man of the committee.
Changes contemplated by the com
mittee include a modification' of the
foreign language requirements and
inclusion of a requirement in the hu
manities, literature, and philosophy
fields of study.
The committee proposes the mcas
: uring of the work in the lower divi
sion by a group of achievement tests
in fields such as the natural sciences,
j humanities, history, and English.
The new program would probably

give some students the opportunity j
to gain credit for certain courses by j
doing individual study and then j
passing the achievement tests in the |
respective fields.
The revised plan, if approved by j
the Academic Council, will probably j
not be put into operation until au
tumn quarter of 1952, because many j
details will have to be worked out.
The purposes of the committee j
were to review the entire lower di- I
vision curriculum at Stanford on the j
basis of what the aims are and how
they can be achieved.
To clo a good job the committee
felt that it was necessary to do two '
things—first, to examine the educa
tional philosophy, the purposes and
aims of the University; and second.!
to determine bow the lower division I
program was carrying out these aims'
and what improvements could be
made.
First of all the committee deter
mined to survey what faculty and 1
student opinion on the present pro- j
gram was.
In that connection the committee. J
gave the Graduate Record Exam to
the members of the class of '51 in
the fall of 1040. The exam is used j
in many eastern universities as a \
basis for admission of students at the !
graduate level.
A second test, given to approxi- I
mately 375 members of the junior
class last spring quarter, was drawn
up at Stanford to test the students by |
Stanford's own standards.
The results of these two tests,;
which have only recently been fully j
tabulated, formed an important basis i
for the proposed revision o fthe pro- I
j gram.
The basic principles of the present
lower division program were set tip
in 1021 under the leadership of the
late Arthur M. Cathcart, professor
iof law, emeritus, at Stanford. The
i program was set up at this time be
! cause it was felt among faculty fno j
students that the major department
plan which was then in operation was
inadequate in providing a genera!
! education for Stanford students.
Under the latter program, a stu
dent had little opportunity for a gen
! era! education, since the major de
; pertinents required nearly all of the
j student's courses to be of a special
ized nature.
Students were thus given little
i training in fields outside their major,
basic English composition being the
only course required of all students
by the University.

The purposes of the committee j
were to review the entire lower di- I
vision curriculum at Stanford on the j
basis of what the aims are and how
they can be achieved.
To clo a good job the committee
felt that it was necessary to do two '
things—first, to examine the educa
tional philosophy, the purposes and
aims of the University; and second.!
to determine bow the lower division I
program was carrying out these aims'
and what improvements could be
made.
First of all the committee deter
mined to survey what faculty and 1
student opinion on the present pro- j
gram was.
In that connection the committee. J
gave the Graduate Record Exam to
the members of the class of '51 in
the fall of 1040. The exam is used j
in many eastern universities as a \
basis for admission of students at the !
graduate level.
A second test, given to approxi- I
mately 375 members of the junior
class last spring quarter, was drawn
up at Stanford to test the students by |
Stanford's own standards.
The results of these two tests,;
which have only recently been fully j
tabulated, formed an important basis i
for the proposed revision o fthe pro- I
j gram.
The basic principles of the present
lower division program were set tip
in 1021 under the leadership of the
late Arthur M. Cathcart, professor
iof law, emeritus, at Stanford. The
i program was set up at this time be
! cause it was felt among faculty fno j
students that the major department
plan which was then in operation was
inadequate in providing a genera!
! education for Stanford students.
Under the latter program, a stu
dent had little opportunity for a gen
! era! education, since the major de
; pertinents required nearly all of the
j student's courses to be of a special
ized nature.
Students were thus given little
i training in fields outside their major,
basic English composition being the
only course required of all students
by the University.
The first major revision of Stan
ford's lower division curriculum in
30 years is expccted to be presented
before the Faculty Acadsmic Council
by the end of winter quarter.
The new program which is the re
sult of two and one-half years of
study and preparation by the Lower
Division Committee at Stanford will
reformulate the lower division re
quirements to render them more ef
fective in giving each Stanford stu
dent a basic general education in his
first two years, according to Clarence
H. Faust, Dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences and co-chair
man of the committee.
Changes contemplated by the com
mittee include a modification' of the
foreign language requirements and
inclusion of a requirement in the hu
manities, literature, and philosophy
fields of study.
The committee proposes the mcas
: uring of the work in the lower divi
sion by a group of achievement tests
in fields such as the natural sciences,
j humanities, history, and English.
The new program would probably

give some students the opportunity j
to gain credit for certain courses by j
doing individual study and then j
passing the achievement tests in the |
respective fields.
