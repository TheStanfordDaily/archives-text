# New Rule Allows Roughs Choice of Service Branch
## Status of Classified Students Is Unknown 
### 
Good news for draft-worried students broke over the weekend
when tly Defense Department released a new order giving stu
dents the right lo volunteer for the armed service of their choice.
The new ruling does not specifically say whether or not stu
dents who are already classified or who have already taken physi
cal examinations arc included. ♦

However, Stanford Chief Coun
selor for Men Richard L. Balch .said
yesterday that the order presumably \
did cover the alrcady-clasjiified stu
dents. He is attempting to yet clad
fication from the Defense Depart- |
merit.
The new ruling goes into efTert im
mediately. It allows students to wait '
until near the end of the college year
before making a choice. Specifically,
enlistments will be accepted in the
two months prior to the last month j
of the quarter.
Thus, if a Stanford student gets a !
draft notice today, he may volunteer
for any branch of the service he
chooses during March or April.
The new ruling does not in any
way affect the deferment of students.
All men are given an automatic de
ferment until the end of the academic
year, regardless of their class stand
ing, if they are doing passing work.
Under the old ruling, students
who received notice of physical ex
aminations automatically lost all
light of enlistment in a branch cf
their choice.
The result was that an estimated
100 men dropped out of school after
fall quarter to enlist n the Air Force
and Navy.
Seniors on campus were especially
pleased with the new ruling, be
cause many of them will have to join
the armed services this summer
after they graduate.
A check of the military status cards
fdled out during registration this
quarter shows that of the mon plan
ning to return next fall, over 1,000
have not been classified yet. They
will definite'"/ be albe to choose their
own branch when they must join the
service.
In addition, about 900 men now
classified 1-A, 1-A-P, and 2-A will
be free to enlist if the new ruling is
retroactive, as Balch believes it is.
