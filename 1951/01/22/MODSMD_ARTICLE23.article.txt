# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
I used to enjoy the rain. Time was when wet
weather spelled sheer delight to my young heart, and
the d; rk clouds of winter sent my spirits soaring.
1 loved to frolic in the storm or take lon<j walks in
11 i<i downpour through the dripping countryside.

But that was before I got my
iifw raincoat.
Now the siyht of a storm cloud
.strikes terror into my heart. At
the lirst drop on the windowpane
1 feel just like the third giraffe
must have felt when Noah told
liirn there were already two gir
affes aboard. Each morning now I
t an the weather reports clesper-

' i"*- *v. jyvj i wo uvopvi ~
aiely, hoping . . . hoping against rain.
All because of my new raincoat.
Not that my new raincoat isn't a fine raincoat, be
cause it is. In fact, I doubt if there is a finer raincoat
in the whole world . . . when it is unfolded.
That's the trouble, you see. It's a folding raincoat.
And when one doesn't have it on. one is supposed to
fold it up and put it in its handy plastic package. The
handy plastic package makes it very easy to carry

around, and thus one can never be caught unprepared j
in cases of sudden necessity, like a Hash Hood in the j
Reserve Book Room.
But the handy plastic package is exactly eiyht inches I
square. I don't know whether you have ever tried to
fold several yards of thick plasilc material into an
eight-inch square, but us a time-consuming operation
it compares favorably with the creation of the Grand
Canyon.
That's why it's now a tossup whether 1 have my I
nervous breakdown before or after I Hunk out. Be
cause. with the weather we've been having lately, I |
find myself spending most of my time folding my rain- '
coat. I've even had to buy a table so I'd have some
place to stretch my raincoat when I take it off and I
have to put it br.ck in its handy plastic package.
So I no longer enjoy the rain, because the moment 1
it comes and I have to put on my new raincoat. 1 know
my prospects for the day are shot to hell. Nowadays
I'm even lucky to get my meals, what with all the '
folding I have to do.
There's just one consolation . . . what a parachute
packer I'm going to make.
