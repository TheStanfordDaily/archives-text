# Ten Men and a Ball
## Friday Night Jinx Strikes Again As Indians Split in Cow Palace Cards Bounce Back in Second Half To Top Dons 69 to 61 in Rough Tilt 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Stanford's "Saturday night" varsity cagers, led by long-shot
artist Jim Walsh, scored a 69 to 61 in win in the Cow Palace over
USF's rough and tumble Dons, Saturday, after bowing to an in
spired Santa Clara guintet, 65 to 55, the night before.
The hot-and-cold Indians, who have not won a Friday night

game since the 02 to 00 Colorado
thriller in mid-December, chalked
up three quick field goals in the final
20 seconds to sew up the ever-so
elfise USF contest.
With less than a minute to go, the
Cards, who were leading'the Dons by
a slim G3 to 01 margin, went into a
stall. Stanford's high scoring for
ward Erl Tucker was forced into a
held ball, but on the jump, he tipped
the ball to center Jim Ramstead who
dribbled in unmolested for an easy
lay-in.
Anothei quick lay-in by Captain
Jack O'Sullivan and a 20-foot push
• hot at tin- final buzzer by Tucker
finished oil the disappointed Dons,

Walsh Is Hero
However, the real Card hero was
none other than guard Jim Walsh,
whose three 30-foot buckets midway
in the second half, put Stanford out
in front for good.
Walsh, who scored 23 points for the
112 ecning, was also invaluable to the
Cards on the backboards, where
USF'js Jerry Mickey had a virtual
monopoly in the first half.
As it is so often in basketball, the
Indians won the game on the foul
line, making good in 21 freethrows
iitil of 28 attempts. Against Santa
Clara, however, the Cards could cash
in on but 15 out of 32 tries.
All USF
The first half was all USF, with
Dons Cappy Lavin and Jerry Hiekey
hitting consistently from far out.
Two 25-foot shots and a driving lay
in by Lavin gave the Dons a com
manding, 25 tf> 19 lead, which was
subsequently extended to a nine
point margin, 31 to 22. The Indians
dosed the gap. but the Dons led at
the half, 34 to 30.
The reverse was true in Friday
night's contest with Coach Bob Fee
lick's fighting Bronco five. The In
dians led most of the way through
the first half, and succumbed to a
tkivin#; Santa Clara rally in the final
tunza.
Although the 01 fouls committed
w.'is a new Cow Palace record, the
;-ame was actually much cleaner than
the rough USF contest. Most of the
mishaps in the Bronco game were

flue to awkwardness rather than in
tentional fouling.
Watson Scores
Forward Paul Watson's three rapid
fire field goals in the closing minutes
of tlie first half helped give the Cards
a 33 to 29 half-time advantage.
But the Broncos were not to be
outdone. Forward Bob Peters took
advantage of Stanford's non-switch
ing man-to-man defense and drove
in for several lay-ins.
The Cards brought the score up to
within one point of the victorious
Broncos, but could not forge ahead.
With three minutes remaining, Santa
Clara assumed a 59 to 49 lead to ice
the game. Paul Watson was the high
scorer for the Indians with 11, and
Bob Peters of the Broncs tallied the
same.
The Card varsity will take a
breather this weekend, but will meet
the high-flying Stewart Chevrolets a
week from Thursday, in the Pavilion.
