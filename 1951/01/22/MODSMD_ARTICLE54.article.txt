# Freshman Cagers Stretch Win Streak to 8 Straight
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's freshman basketballers
won their seventh and eighth ron-
I secutive games as they downed
highly touted Galileo Hith School of
; San Francisco 56 to 30 Friday and
knocked off Monterey High School
78 to 45 Saturday in the Pavilion.
The two - game series was espe
i cially pleasing in so far as reserves
were concerned. The Papoose at
tack lost nothing when the starting
; five left the court, and numerous
j substitutes poured in.
The yearlings had complete back
board control in both games and
were never pressed, save for the first
lew minutes of the Galileo affair.
Galileo had a 5 to 4 lead in the first
few minutes fo the game, but a long
push shot by forward Dun DeLong
and a hook shot by forward Harold
Ellis gave Stanford a lead it never
relinquished. The Cardbabes left the
court with a 23 to .13 half-time ad
! vantage. ?
The Monterey titr was equally ef
fortless us the Stanfords built up a
33 to 15 half-time bulge.
The weekend marked the return
i to action of center Dave Epperson,

who scored 23 points in the two
games.
