# Card Rugby Team Wins
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team, the Big
Red Machine minus pads, won an in
glorious 5 to 0 victory over Clark
Congdon's Menlo Park Rangers last
Saturday afternoon on the Stanford
rugby Held. Pete Kmetovic's charges
scrimmaged as though rugby was
the winter form of football, and the
scrum was merely a vicious line
charge.
The only scoring was made early
in the game, when during one of the
more confusing mix-ups Bob Stan
ley ran the ball into the end zone.
The try was made by Russ Latham
and added two points to the Stanford
goal. Highlights of the afternoon in
cluded a near score by hard-running
scrum Norm Manoogian, who once
he got his hands on the oversized
football refused to let it go.
All - American Bill McColl terri
fied the hard-breathing Rangers by
running helter-skelter through their
backs. His attempts at kicking goals
werb unsuccessful, but 50 yards is
not the best kicking distance.
were completely at home with the
English sport, and that their forth
coming game with the Olympic Club
in San Francisco this Saturday will
be an interesting brawl.
