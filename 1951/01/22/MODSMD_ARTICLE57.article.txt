ball team, should be the one hired to
replace JefT Cravath, who resigned
! under pressure last month.
Denny Gless, last year's president
of the Trojan Club, an alumni group,
indicated that some alumni organi
zations would be reluctant to help in
i the rushing program — recruiting of
athletes—if Eliot gets the job. Uni
versity officials have termed the
alumni outbursts "a tempest in a
teapot."

ant at Illinois, also eatne here and it
is believed the Trojans offered Eliot
i and Ingwcrsen a "package deal."
