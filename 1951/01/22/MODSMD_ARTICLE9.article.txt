nist League, will speak tonight at 8 p.m. in the Palo Alto High
School Auditorium under the sponsorship of Stanford student,
Donald E. Close.
Close, a member of the Los Angeles Anti-Communist League,

hit back at local criticism of Swift by ,
, saying, "Dr. Swift is the victim of an j
1 organized smear campaign."
The Executive Committee of the
j Stanford Chapter of the American
I Civil Liberties Union prepared a
statement this weekend calling at
tention to Swift's background. Their
report stated;
' "Mr. Swift is closely connected
with Gerald L. K. Smith, well-known
! anti-Semite and leader of the hate
l spreading 'Christian Nationalist Cru
! sadc.'
"Mr. Swift has admitted publicly
his membership in the Ku Klux
Klan, the anti-Negro, anti-Catho
lic organization well known for its
burning crosses and white hoods.
"We do nnt question Mr. Swift's
right to speak, but we feci that this
information should he brought to
the attention of the public."
According to Close, "The Amcri
; can Civil Liberties Union was cited ,
in the Fifth Report of the California
State Un-American Activities Com
j mittee as a Communist front organ- |
! ization.
i "This group has attempted to pcr
-1 pctuate a campaign of malice and
! smear to destroy the reputation of an
j innocent man and a patriotic Ameri
j can," Close said.
Swift, who claims to have a D.D.
degree from Columbia, received at
tention in Arnold Forster's "A Mca
i sure of Freedom," the Anti-Defama
| tion League report published this
year by Doubleday. According to
| this report:
"1949 was also a profitable year for
I Wesley Swift, the smooth-talking
i missionary for the 'Anglo-Saxon
! brand of theology. The Reverend
Mr. Swift contends that Anglo Sax
ons are the true descendants of the
len Lost Tribes of Israel and, there
fore, entitled to be known as Israel
ite; the Jews arc impostors.
I "This nonsense was worth $10,000
| through such West Coast outfits as
: the Great Pyramid Club, the Anglo
-1 Saxon Christian Congregation, and
' the Anglo-American Bible Study
Group, all of them served by Swift
j as spiritual and financial leader. His
j meetings were well attended."
* According tr» Close, Swift has
j ,ius( returned from Washington
I where he testified before the Un-
American Activities Committee in
support of a bill introduced liy
John E. Rankin (I)., Miss.), railing
for the outlawing of the Anti-De
famation League,
Hie Stanford sophomore arranged
for Swift to speak in Palo Alto dur
ing Christmas vacation when he
learned that. Swift was coming to the
Marines Auditorium in San Fran
cisco on Jan. 2').
Close secured the Palo Alto High
j School auditorium under th<* pro
vision of the State Educational Code
which permits the use of state school
facilities for political meetings if not
l in use by educational groups.
Palo Alto High School Business
Manager 11. F. Koeitig said law
prohibits investigation of speakers
if proper arrangements are made
for the use of the building.
The subject of Swift's address is,
"Sccret Government in America."
Close .believes that lie may discuss
the appointment of Mrs. Anna Ros
enberg to assistant secretary of de
fense. since he was an instrumental
figure in obtaining an investigation of
Mrs. Rosenberg.

nist League, will speak tonight at 8 p.m. in the Palo Alto High
School Auditorium under the sponsorship of Stanford student,

Close, a member of the Los Angeles Anti-Communist League,

hit back at local criticism of Swift by ,
, saying, "Dr. Swift is the victim of an j
1 organized smear campaign."
The Executive Committee of the
j Stanford Chapter of the American
I Civil Liberties Union prepared a
statement this weekend calling at
tention to Swift's background. Their
report stated;
' "Mr. Swift is closely connected
with Gerald L. K. Smith, well-known
! anti-Semite and leader of the hate
l spreading 'Christian Nationalist Cru
! sadc.'
"Mr. Swift has admitted publicly
his membership in the Ku Klux
Klan, the anti-Negro, anti-Catho
lic organization well known for its
burning crosses and white hoods.
"We do nnt question Mr. Swift's
right to speak, but we feci that this
information should he brought to
the attention of the public."
According to Close, "The Amcri
; can Civil Liberties Union was cited ,
in the Fifth Report of the California
State Un-American Activities Com
j mittee as a Communist front organ- |
! ization.
i "This group has attempted to pcr
-1 pctuate a campaign of malice and
! smear to destroy the reputation of an
j innocent man and a patriotic Ameri
j can," Close said.
Swift, who claims to have a D.D.
degree from Columbia, received at
tention in Arnold Forster's "A Mca
i sure of Freedom," the Anti-Defama
| tion League report published this
year by Doubleday. According to
| this report:
"1949 was also a profitable year for
I Wesley Swift, the smooth-talking
i missionary for the 'Anglo-Saxon
! brand of theology. The Reverend
Mr. Swift contends that Anglo Sax
ons are the true descendants of the
len Lost Tribes of Israel and, there
fore, entitled to be known as Israel
ite; the Jews arc impostors.
I "This nonsense was worth $10,000
| through such West Coast outfits as
: the Great Pyramid Club, the Anglo
-1 Saxon Christian Congregation, and
' the Anglo-American Bible Study
Group, all of them served by Swift
j as spiritual and financial leader. His

* According tr» Close, Swift has
j ,ius( returned from Washington

support of a bill introduced liy
John E. Rankin (I)., Miss.), railing
for the outlawing of the Anti-De
