# China Reds Agree To Cease-fire, But-
## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 22 (UP) Communist China has ac
cepted the United Nations proposal for a cease-fire in Korea at the
opening of a conference on the Far East, but has left a barrier to
peace in its demand for admission to the UN, India disclosed today.
India told tho UN that Red China insisted on a time limit to the

cease-fire order.
By its surprise move Peking ap
peared to have removed one ol the
main harriers blocking earlier efforts
to reach a Korean truce, but another
important stumbling block Red
China's demand for admission to the
UN—remained.
Return To China
In another maneuver, the Chinese
Communists formally announced
they would "assume the responsi
bility to advise thChinese volun
teers to return to China" il the prin
ciple of withdrawal of foreign troops
is put into effect.
The new stand by Mao Tze-tung's
government seemed almost certain to
postpone for some time passage of the
American proposal to brand Peking
an aggressor and to consider im
mediately the imposition of punitive
measures.
Much Skepticism
; The new Chinese Communist
policy statement was greeted with
considerable skepticism here, not
only because of the continued de
mand for admission to the UN, but
also because of the phrasing ol the
demand for discussion of Formosa.
It called for negotiation "in order to
reach agreement upon . . . the with
drawal of the United States armed
forces from Taiwan (Formosa . . ."
The new message l'rom Peking was
surprising but it quickly became ap
parent that several snags still stand
in Jhe way of a Korean cease-fire:
1. Peking's demand that its "legiti
mate status" in the UN "must be en
sured."
2. The United States' stand—made
crystal clear yesterday — that Na
tionalist China must have its say in
any negotiations on the future of
Formosa.
3. Peking's condition that there
must be a time-limit on a cease-fire.
4. The United States' understand
ing, again made clear in yesterday's
statement by UN Delegate Ernest A.
Gross, that withdrawal of foreign
troops must also mean withdrawal of
North Korean troops from south of
the 38th parallel.
