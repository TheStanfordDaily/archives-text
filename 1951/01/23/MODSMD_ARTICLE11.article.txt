# Questions, Jeers Rout Dr. Swift
## 
### JOY HAAS 
Dr. Wesley A. Swift, state direc
tor of the California Anti-Commu
nist League, left the platform of the
Palo Alto High School auditorium
twice in one hour last night, the final
time after students demanded that
j he answer their questions from the
floor.
More than 400 Stanfordites
swarmed into the auditorium to
challenge Swift's statements about
"The Secret Government of Amer
ica."
As students successively hissed,
heckled, and filed out (a few
garbed in improvised Ku Klux
Klan masks), Swift accused the
crowd of being the "most discour
teous" he bad ever met. With
that, he stalked off the stage.
Ihe burly, explosive Swift
■ charged the local American Civil
! Liberties Union, which prepared a
I statement this week exposing his Ku
Klux Klan and anti-Semitic affilia
tions, with "seeing that wrong facts
are sowed in this community."
Many local citizens condemned
, the student actions. Some of the
[ comments overheard were:
"There's nothing funny this.
It. is the most disgraceful thing I've
; ever heard."
"I'm not going to send my kids to
college if that's the way they act."
When unfavorable student reac
tion drove Swift off the stage the first
time, ACLU member and temporary
junior Excom representative Dick
O'Connell quieted the crowd and re
minded them that Swift had a right
to speak and receive courteous at
tention whether or not the audience
jgreed with his views.
Swift, who was sponsored by
Stanford student Donald E. Close,
returned to bis podium, placed
midway between the Mar of the
I'uiled States and the California
stale flag, and declined a student
request to discuss Communis! in
filtrations into U.S. school systems.
However, Swift, did sav that he
believed there were many social sci
entists and socialist planners planted
in tho schools.
Get this if you don't get anything
else," Swift, said, shaking a fist at the
audience, "20 per cent of the world,
composed mostly of Christian na
tions," produces S3 per cent of the
world wealth. The nucleus of the
'secret government," Felix Frank
furter, Henry Morgenthau, Senator
Herbert Lehman, threatens to re
| duce us to .'lO per cent of our present
J living standard in order to equalize
♦ his wraith over the world, Swift
[ trumpeted.
A student interrupted Swift's al
ienations that the Dumbarton Oaks
I and Bret ton Woods monetary agree
i ments were entered into without the
' knowledge or consent of Congress.
The student asked how it was pos
j ;ible for Congress to be kept in such
j ignorance if they had to appropriate
all funds paid out of the Treasury.
Close came to the front and re
ndu ed the audience that ques
tion* were out of order for the
mei I :ig, and Swift's enly answer
before he left the staye for the last
time was:
"TonV;hi we arc talking about

[ comments overheard were:
"There's nothing funny this.
It. is the most disgraceful thing I've
; ever heard."
"I'm not going to send my kids to
college if that's the way they act."
When unfavorable student reac
tion drove Swift off the stage the first
time, ACLU member and temporary
junior Excom representative Dick
O'Connell quieted the crowd and re
minded them that Swift had a right
to speak and receive courteous at
tention whether or not the audience
jgreed with his views.
Swift, who was sponsored by
Stanford student Donald E. Close,
returned to bis podium, placed
midway between the Mar of the
I'uiled States and the California
stale flag, and declined a student
request to discuss Communis! in
filtrations into U.S. school systems.
However, Swift, did sav that he
believed there were many social sci
entists and socialist planners planted
in tho schools.
Get this if you don't get anything
else," Swift, said, shaking a fist at the
audience, "20 per cent of the world,
composed mostly of Christian na
tions," produces S3 per cent of the
world wealth. The nucleus of the
'secret government," Felix Frank
furter, Henry Morgenthau, Senator
Herbert Lehman, threatens to re
| duce us to .'lO per cent of our present
J living standard in order to equalize
♦ his wraith over the world, Swift
[ trumpeted.
A student interrupted Swift's al
ienations that the Dumbarton Oaks
I and Bret ton Woods monetary agree
i ments were entered into without the
' knowledge or consent of Congress.
The student asked how it was pos
j ;ible for Congress to be kept in such
j ignorance if they had to appropriate
all funds paid out of the Treasury.
Close came to the front and re
ndu ed the audience that ques
tion* were out of order for the
mei I :ig, and Swift's enly answer
before he left the staye for the last
time was:
"TonV;hi we arc talking about
the Secret Government."
Dr. Wesley A. Swift, state direc
tor of the California Anti-Commu
nist League, left the platform of the
Palo Alto High School auditorium
twice in one hour last night, the final
time after students demanded that
j he answer their questions from the
floor.
More than 400 Stanfordites
swarmed into the auditorium to
challenge Swift's statements about
"The Secret Government of Amer
ica."
As students successively hissed,
heckled, and filed out (a few
garbed in improvised Ku Klux
Klan masks), Swift accused the
crowd of being the "most discour
teous" he bad ever met. With
that, he stalked off the stage.
Ihe burly, explosive Swift
■ charged the local American Civil
! Liberties Union, which prepared a
I statement this week exposing his Ku
Klux Klan and anti-Semitic affilia
tions, with "seeing that wrong facts
are sowed in this community."
Many local citizens condemned
, the student actions. Some of the
[ comments overheard were:
