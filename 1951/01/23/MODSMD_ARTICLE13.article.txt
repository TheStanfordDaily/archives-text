# 379-BIGGEST PLEDGE CLASS IN HISTORY!
## Fraternities Average 16 Pledges Apiece 
### BOB BATLIN 
The largest pledge class in
Stanford's history, all 379 of
them, filled the Women's Club
house for three-quarters of an
hour last night as its members
signed formal pledge cards.
An average of 16 men pledged
each of the 24 fraternities. Sigma Chi
had the largest class, 28 men. Al
pha Tau Omega and Phi Delta Gam
ma were second and third with 26
and 25, respectively. The smallest
class was that of Phi Kappa Psi, with
four.
Up to now, the largest class ever
pledged had totaled 335 in 1947. Even
though this year's group of fledg
lings is a record number, two weeks
ago, at the start of rushing, fraterni
ties had hoped to pledge about 425.
Dave Larimer, Interfraternity
Council president, accredited the
decline to the fact that many men
were hesitant about pledging in
these troubled times. He believed
that the total would rise to 400 with
in a week, however.
About 7 last night, the men liegan
lininc up on the Women's Clubhouse
steps, having just left preference
dinners at the various houses. At
7:30 they moved up to the several
desks where Interfraternity Council
officers witnessed the signing of
their pledge cards.
Beta Theta Pi was the last house
to enroll en masse, waiting till the
last rush of rushing had subsided at
8:20. By 8:30, an estimated half of
the 24 rushing chairmen were back
in their rooms, sleeping their first
sound sleep in recent weeks.
A 3 p.m. approximation by rush
ing chairmen placed the total of
pledges at 389. Between then and
7:30, The Daily was rushed with calls
from virtually all 24 of the houses
reporting last - minute catches and
losses. The additions lost pace with
the subtractions, and when the last
card was counted in the Women's
Clubhouse, the sum was 379.
After the pledae card formality
was over, the general attitude of both
was over, the general attitude of
both rusher and rushee was, "Thank
Gorl that's over!" But then, as one
pledge looked at rushing, "at least it
meant good dinners."


RUSHING FINALE—The Climax of rushing activities came last
night with the signing of pledge cards in the lower lounge of
the Women's Clubhouse. Shown (left to right) from Theta Xi
are Earl Edmunds, Interfraternity Council member, R.indy
Wilde, Pete Bates, Skip Fortson, Dick Yeo, and Stewart Ledbet
ter. All but Edmunds and Bates are pledges.

the subtractions, and when the last
card was counted in the Women's
Clubhouse, the sum was 379.
After the pledae card formality
was over, the general attitude of both
was over, the general attitude of
both rusher and rushee was, "Thank
Gorl that's over!" But then, as one
pledge looked at rushing, "at least it
meant good dinners."


RUSHING FINALE—The Climax of rushing activities came last
night with the signing of pledge cards in the lower lounge of
the Women's Clubhouse. Shown (left to right) from Theta Xi

The largest pledge class in
Stanford's history, all 379 of
them, filled the Women's Club
house for three-quarters of an
hour last night as its members
signed formal pledge cards.
An average of 16 men pledged
each of the 24 fraternities. Sigma Chi
had the largest class, 28 men. Al
pha Tau Omega and Phi Delta Gam
ma were second and third with 26
and 25, respectively. The smallest
class was that of Phi Kappa Psi, with
four.
Up to now, the largest class ever
pledged had totaled 335 in 1947. Even
though this year's group of fledg
lings is a record number, two weeks
ago, at the start of rushing, fraterni
ties had hoped to pledge about 425.
Dave Larimer, Interfraternity
Council president, accredited the
decline to the fact that many men
were hesitant about pledging in
these troubled times. He believed
that the total would rise to 400 with
in a week, however.
About 7 last night, the men liegan
lininc up on the Women's Clubhouse
steps, having just left preference
dinners at the various houses. At
7:30 they moved up to the several
desks where Interfraternity Council
officers witnessed the signing of
their pledge cards.
Beta Theta Pi was the last house
to enroll en masse, waiting till the
last rush of rushing had subsided at
8:20. By 8:30, an estimated half of
the 24 rushing chairmen were back
in their rooms, sleeping their first
sound sleep in recent weeks.
A 3 p.m. approximation by rush
ing chairmen placed the total of
pledges at 389. Between then and
7:30, The Daily was rushed with calls
from virtually all 24 of the houses
reporting last - minute catches and
losses. The additions lost pace with
the subtractions, and when the last
card was counted in the Women's
Clubhouse, the sum was 379.
After the pledae card formality
was over, the general attitude of both
was over, the general attitude of
both rusher and rushee was, "Thank
Gorl that's over!" But then, as one
pledge looked at rushing, "at least it
meant good dinners."
