# Fraternities Still Have Vacancies, Larimer Says
## 
### 
Interfraternity Council President I
Dave Larimer estimates there re- 1
main an average of approximately
four vacancies per house after the j
close of formal rushing season.
The figure is based on the pre- j
rushing estimate of 20 pledges per
house.
Many houses will attempt to fill
those vacancies throughout the year. |
especially since the armed forces |
threaten to deplete Stanford frater
nities.

"It is important to remember th it
rushing does not end at thr clor,c <>l
the formal rushing period," im. r
reminded.
Rushing will continue wintri and
spring quarters, though the two
week period that ended last night i.
more concentrated.
Pledging after the formal rushing
season offers advantages both to fra
ternities and to rushees, Larimer
said, since later judgments are more
likely to be realistic.
