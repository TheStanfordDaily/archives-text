House, graduate women's resi
dence in the home of Mrs. El
wood P. Cubberley, widow of j
the former dean of education,
has been renamed Cubberley
House.
In changing the names of <lie two
houses the University paid honor I
to two pioneer Stanford names.
The change came as a surprise to
the women in the Row house, who
heard the news after dinner. Still
man House is named after the late
Professor and Mrs. John Maxson
Stillman and their three daughters.
The house was formerly the
Kappa Alpha Theta House, to which
Professor and Mrs. Stillman were |

longed.
In informing Mrs. Cubberley of the
change in name of "Hilltop House" to j
"Cubberley House," President Wal
lace Sterling of Stanford wrote: "]» is j
most fitting that the Cubberley name
should be attached to the house
which was for so many years your l
home with Dr. Cubberley. and which !
you now share with a fortunate group j
of graduate women students."
Dr. Cubherley, one of the most dis- j
tinguished figures in the history of j
American education, joined the Stan
ford faculty in IROFt and was dean of
the School of Education from the i
time of its establishment in 11)17 until
his retirement in 1033.
Mrs. Cubberley, since her hus
band's death in 1041, has given their
home, "Hilltop House," to the Uni
versity as a residence for graduate
women. But more than that, she has
made the residence a real home for
her "eirls" and kept in close touch
with them not only while they were
in school but after they have left
the University and gone to all parts
of the world.
Mrs. Cubberley, with her hus
band, was co-donor of the Stan
ford School of Education Building,
