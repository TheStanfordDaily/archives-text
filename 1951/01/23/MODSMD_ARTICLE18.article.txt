Sfhifts in the morale of college men and wom
en pccuj almost daily as they read and consider
Pleases from Washington and from
around the world. Immediately following
Chiistmas vacation students had reason to look
pessimistically at their futures.
Several beds were vacant at fraternity houses
from which men had enlisted because of this
»
serious disease—"draft jitters." We proposed
that t&e.entire campus consider, as a resolu
tion for the New Year, a more healthy—call it
optimistic—look at the future.
Two men who have worked hardest to inter
pret and clarify the draft situation both as to its
overall implications and its individual problems
are Dean of Students Donald Winbigler and
Chief Counselor for Men Richard Balch.
Each male student's draft status meant sev
eral things to the administrators. Could the
man be encouraged to stay in school even
though he might lose his opportunity to enlist
after being called for a physical examination?
Could the man's hopes for continuing his edu
cation until graduation, whether it be this year
or two years from now, be cushioned against
the confused scuttlebutt tossed around by "po-

I
litical experts?"
After reading Monday morning's headlines,
we are even more cognizant of the fine work
Dr. Winbigler and Mr. Balch have done. For
now students can enlist at the end of the year
even though they may have taken physical ex
aminations. Many men who followed the ad
visers' suggestions now are in the fine position
of still being in school—with a chance to enlist
at the end of the school year.
Stanford basketball coach Everett Dean con
tributed many dollars of good-will in the form
of appreciation from Bay Area basketball fans
when he agreed to move one of the scheduled
games with California to the Cow Palace from
the cracker-box Pavilion.
Among sports experts, Stanford has for
feited anything from five to 10 points by elim
inating the home court advantage.
It would be too much to expect UC, which
has ample seating capacity, to make a com
promise out of the Stanford offer by shifting
the Berkeley game to the midway Cow Palace.
However, the situation serves as another re
minder of the ever-occurring dream of a new
Pavilion.

After reading Monday morning's headlines,
we are even more cognizant of the fine work
Dr. Winbigler and Mr. Balch have done. For

Stanford basketball coach Everett Dean con
tributed many dollars of good-will in the form
of appreciation from Bay Area basketball fans
when he agreed to move one of the scheduled
games with California to the Cow Palace from

has ample seating capacity, to make a com
promise out of the Stanford offer by shifting
the Berkeley game to the midway Cow Palace.
However, the situation serves as another re
minder of the ever-occurring dream of a new
Pavilion.
