COLON HARBOR—GATEWAY TO THE PANAMA
CANAL—The crew of the YANKEE was more than
overjoyed to lay anchor in the harbor off Colon.
For one thing, it meant an end to the awful rolling
and pitching which leit everyone completely ex-
Krtlicfnrl C\ 11

hausted when the sea finally
calmed down one night away from
port. For another. Colon meant
mail from families and friends
telling of local news at home.
After a brief half-hour ashore,
Gay appeared in the dinghy with
a big sackful of mail for all of us.
But instead of a gracious and sub
missive ciowd to welcome him,

poor Gay was subjected to a horrible mauling and
trampling as the \ankees assaulted him, each t one dig
ging around for his own mail. But for the certain
young lady corresponding with Gay, I don't think he •
could be found taking the job of letter courier again.
In Cristobal, most of us confined our activities to
buying French perfumes to bring home. Tliere per--
lume costs only one-quarter as much as it does in
the States. »
But it was a short stay, and early next morning—
about 6 a.m.—the pilot came aboard and we hoisted
anchor to begin passage through the canal. '
At this time of year, the Caribbean side is in the
throes of one of its rainiest seasons in history; 24

hours of rain a day. I became so exasperated with my
wet clothes that I started the transit working on deck
clad only in a bathing suit. It was too cold, however— i
very unusual for the torrid Canal Zone—so I wound
up back in warmer clothes and oilskins.
The pilot, Mac, seemed to form an unusual attach
ment for the YANKEE and her crew. There being no j
sheltered pilot house to steer from, he became wet to
the skin before the second lock, but got a terrific
kick out of rolling up his pants and doffing his shoes
in true YANKEE style. The attachment grew so
strong that Mac later took many of us on side trips
around the zone in his automobile.
NEWS, although only in trickles, is coming to us
now of the reverses the UN has suffered in the Orient.
Frorti now until our arrival in Honolulu in March,
the jyrew and cruise will be overshadowed by war.
The most we can hope for is to complete the voy
age up to that'point without having anyone called
Isack to the States. Nonetheless, some of us still will
be able to accomplish one of the best and most beau
■* tifttl-parts of the cruise before considering our roles
in total mobilization.
Ahead lie the Galapagos Islands. Pitcairn, where
we dive on the skeleton of the H.M.S. Bounty, the
South Seas, and Tahiti. So. for a while yet, our plans
still may reap good harvests.
