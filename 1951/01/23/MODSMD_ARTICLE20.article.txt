## Time Out to Think 
### 
To the Editor:
Just a word of thanks for the article on "Dr." Swift.
Our country and our democratic ideals are just as
tiong as the things we do and the methods we use.
No matter how we may personally feel, the article on
the Anti-Communist League made each of us take
a moment of our time to think.

i
The article didn't rant, the article didn't slander
(the way Mr. Swift and the Commies so often do).
Instead the article presented both sides of the story.
Each of us could make up our own minds after we had
read the facts.
I hanks to Miss Joy Haas and the editorial staff of
The Stanford Daily for showing us the strength of de
mocracy and the responsibility of the American'FÃŸEE
press.
