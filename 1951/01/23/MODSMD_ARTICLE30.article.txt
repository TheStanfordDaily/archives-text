## 
### 
The Red Cross Mobile Blood Unit
of Sah Jose will come to Stanford
on January 31 with a minimum col
lection goal of 200 pints for the day.
Students can moke appointments to i
donate blood Friday.
Military surgeons have identified
blood plasma as the major cause of
the low death rate among wounded
American servicemen. The highest
recovery record in military history
was reached in the last war when 97
per cent of the wounded survived.
Last July, former Defense Secre
tary Louis Johnson asked General
George C. Marshall, president of the
American Red Cross, to increase Ihe
output of the National Blood Pro*
gram to provide the armed services
with the blood that increased casu
alties would require.
Since then. 35 Regional Blood
Centers in major cities ali over the
United States and 46 Mobile Unit:
have been operating in a stepped-up
program to collect blood. Blood is ;
now being collected at the rate of
over 90,000 pints a month. To meet
the new demands of the Korean war, I
the Red Cross will have to increase
present collections by nearly 100
per cent.
All types of blood can be turned
into plasma and stored for a num
ber of years. Type O blood is espe

cially valuable as it is preserved as
whole blood, refrigerated, and flown
to byttle stations. All blood is sent
daily from the 35 regional collection
centers to the processing laborato- j
ries in Philadelphia. San Francisco,
and Los Angeles.
The blood donated here Jan. 31
will be transported to San Jose in the
late afternoon, where the whole
