# Fraternities, Freshmen Laud Delayed Rushing

The 24 Stanford fraternities and some 750 freshmen men turned again lo their books and a more
or less regular life today, after last night's formal fraternity pledging that climaxed a two-week round
of open houses, parties, and other rushing activities.
For the roughly 400 men who signed pledge cards, an important decision had been made; one
that will affect their lives as long as they remain in Stanford.
Dave Larimer, Inetrfraternity Council president, expressed the general fraternity attitude when

he said he was "pleased" with the<
way rushing activities were handled
And this seemed the general con
sensus of freshmen, who almost
unanimously praised Stanford's sys
tem Â«>(' deferred rushing and the open
houses that preceded the period of
unlimited contact between fraternity
men and rushees.
"Any rushing system is hound to
have imperfections in which im
portant decisions arc made in such
a shot ! period of time and where
the decisions are often necessarily
based on early and sometimes
artificial impressions," Larimer
said.
lie said he noticed a definite tend
ency to pledge relatively late in the
rushing period. He attributed this in
part to the campaign of Interfratern
ity Council and Encina and Toyon
sponsors who stressed the import
ance of a wise decision regarding
pledging.
In view of this, Larimer believed
there would be less breaking of
pledges this year than has occurred
in past years.
(Until signing of pledge cards last
night, pledges were not binding. If
a man breaks his pledge now, he may
not pledge another house until next
autumn quarter. If the fraternity
breaks his pledge, he may pledge an
other house at any time.)
Though most freshmen thought
rushing activities were well hand
led, there were some criticisms of
the fast pace that rushing took.
One suggestion voiced by several
fro.sh was that one night be set aside
in the middle of rushing period on
which no invitations could be is
sued.
Such a night, freshmen suggested,
would enable frosh who had lagged
behind to catch up on studying, and
in general "get their hearings" and
a better perspective on the entire
rushing procedure.
