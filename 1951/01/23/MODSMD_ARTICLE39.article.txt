# Row Houses to Face Second Draft Crisis
## 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
America's mobilization plans arc
forcing the second crisis in a decadc
upon Stanfords' fraternities, hut bar
ring all-out war, the fraternities ex
pect to weather the storm.
The imminent crisis under the cur
rent draft legislation is how to keep
the fraternities operating in the face
of diminishing memberships.
The problem is even more compli
cated because no one knows for sure
how many men will be drafted from
the campus.
0(1(1 Fraternity Men
Approximately 000 men inhabit the
2\ campus fraternity houses, accord
ing to Richard Balch, Chief Counselor
for men. Of these, he estimates,
about 20 per cent will be drafted next
year.
A fraternity can pay operating ex
penses and run a kitchen with about
30 members. When membership falls
j below that, it gets harder.
ff a fraternity closes up the kitchen
Balch said, it could operate with
few as 10 members.
One problem to be ironed out ii
the future is whether or not to com
bine kitchens, thus having two oi
more houses eating in one kitchen
Another problem that may have tc
be faced is that of combining houses
If this happens, some of the house;
will have to be given up, and tha
opens up a whole new series of prob
lems.
Houses At War
During World War 11, all frater
nity houses were turned over to th<
University to be used in the war ef
J foa t. When the fraternites rcorgan
ized in 1946, members found ther

buildings depreciated. Consequent
ly many are saddled with mortgages
of thousands of dollars, after bor
rowing to remodel and repair.
A formula, fixing the University's
obligation to the fraternities will
have to be worked out, in case some
of the houses are relinquished. The
formula will have to include main
tenance and upkeep.
Important Pledge Class
The 400 pledges garnered through
the intensive rushing period will
play a vital role in the future of
Stanfords' fraternities, Balch said,
for most of them should return next
autumn.
The fraternities fill an important
need for the close association of men
with similar interests. They are good
for the members and healthy for the
University.

need for the close association of men
with similar interests. They are good
for the members and healthy for the
University.
America's mobilization plans arc
forcing the second crisis in a decadc
upon Stanfords' fraternities, hut bar
ring all-out war, the fraternities ex
pect to weather the storm.
The imminent crisis under the cur
rent draft legislation is how to keep
the fraternities operating in the face
of diminishing memberships.
The problem is even more compli
cated because no one knows for sure
how many men will be drafted from
the campus.
0(1(1 Fraternity Men
Approximately 000 men inhabit the
2\ campus fraternity houses, accord
ing to Richard Balch, Chief Counselor
for men. Of these, he estimates,
about 20 per cent will be drafted next
year.
A fraternity can pay operating ex
penses and run a kitchen with about
30 members. When membership falls
j below that, it gets harder.
ff a fraternity closes up the kitchen
Balch said, it could operate with
few as 10 members.
One problem to be ironed out ii
the future is whether or not to com
bine kitchens, thus having two oi
more houses eating in one kitchen
Another problem that may have tc
be faced is that of combining houses
If this happens, some of the house;
will have to be given up, and tha
opens up a whole new series of prob
lems.
Houses At War
During World War 11, all frater
nity houses were turned over to th<
University to be used in the war ef
J foa t. When the fraternites rcorgan
ized in 1946, members found ther

buildings depreciated. Consequent
ly many are saddled with mortgages
of thousands of dollars, after bor
rowing to remodel and repair.
A formula, fixing the University's
obligation to the fraternities will
have to be worked out, in case some
of the houses are relinquished. The
formula will have to include main
tenance and upkeep.
Important Pledge Class
The 400 pledges garnered through
the intensive rushing period will
play a vital role in the future of
Stanfords' fraternities, Balch said,
for most of them should return next
autumn.
The fraternities fill an important
need for the close association of men
with similar interests. They are good
for the members and healthy for the
University.
