# Eating Clubs Will Rush Men Until At Pre-War Strength
## 
### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs will continue to pledge new members through the year until they
reach their quota of approximately 40 members each, a total of about 80 or 90 new men.
The eating clubs' rushing program received added impetus last week when Stanford President
Wallace J. Sterling announced that the clubs' long -awaited building would soon become a reality.
Construction on the 5183,000 structure will begin this week, or as soon as weather permits, and

should be completed in four months.
The clubs will open the doors to
their individual dining rooms in the
fall.
Le Kelson, Interclub president,
considers the building the signal
for the clubs to rise to their pre
war status. "It will offer room and
facilities to carry on an expanded
social program," he said.

The seven clubs — Los Arcos, El
Toro, Ei Cuadro, El Tigre, El Campo,
El Capitan, and Breakers — held
combined open houses at Toyon Jan.
11 and 17. On these nights, frosh met
club members and signed up for din
ners with the respective groups.
Freshmen who did not put their
names on dinner lists l>ut wish to
he invited to a club dinner may
so arrange with their sponsors.
Clubs are loosely organized groups
which offer companionship and so
cial activities without the more rigid
ties of fraternities. In addition to
eating together, the members join in
dances, intramural sports, beach
parties, and similar events.
The clubs are regularly allowed
priorities on Toyon vacancies, and
last fall virtually all members were
assigned rooms in the dormitory.

Eating club history dates back
to 1901, when Los Arcos was
formed. Eleven .years later. Break
ers, El Campo, and El Toro came
along to build their own kitchens
and club-rooms across from En
cina. When Encina Commons was
built, Los Arcos, El Capitan, El
Cuadro. and El Tigre each had one
of the small dining rooms for a
cluhroom.
Because of the war, the clubs sus
pended operations in 1943, but came
back in 194G. In the meantime, the
"Little Quad" of kitchens and din
ing rooms was destroyed, and the
clubrooms in Encina were taken
over by the Commons. Consequent
ly, the seven clubs are all currently
eating in one dining hall in Encina.

without all the ties of fraternities.
