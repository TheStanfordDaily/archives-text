Born within loudspeaker range of
Lb bet Is liel ', acting fresh coach
"Brooklyn Hill" Alhouse brings
professional knowhow with u new
accent to the Stanford baseball
scene.
Alhouse, a 25-year-old graduate
student in the School of Education,
lascinated varsity infielders last fall
with a skilful blond of inside tips and
running commentaries on the ways
of pro ball, delivered in rapid Brook
lyne.se.
Nothing New
Handling ballplayers is not a new
experience for the young ex-Santa
Barbara Dodger second baseman.
Last summer lie managed the Class
D Gustonia, N.C., team to a last
place fini h.
In fairness to Bill, it should be in
serted that the team was dead last
when he took it over, arid was com
mitted to a money-saving policy of ,
playing local talent fresh out of high
school.
"This is the bett break I've had in
baseball," says Bill of his Stanford
job. Quite a break for Farm base- ■
bailers, too, it might be added, in |
getting the benefit of his recent pro j
experience.
The slightjy-built Alhouse started
his baseball career a A a catcher at
Stonybrook Prep, Long Island. He !
went on to Ho hart College for a se- !
mester before transferring to St. '
Mary's in the Navy Pre-flight pro
gram. Later he served at sea in the j
Pacific. While Bill was in the Navy, |
the Philadelphia Phillies' Cy Per
kins converted him to a shortstop.
Tripped Troy
Alhouse picked lip enough credits |
in the service to enter Santa Bar
bara College as a sophomore and win
the second base spot on the 1947 j
Gaucho outfit that embarrassed
mighty USC.
The Trojans that year had
amassed an imposing winning streak
against all comers, including several
major league teams in California for |
spring training, and breezed conde
scendingly into Santa Barbara for a
night game that promised little more
than a workout. The Gauchos were
high for the game, got ofr to a fast
start, and held off a desperate USC
rally to win.
"SC Coaches Barry and Dedeaux
sat on the bench with their eyes pop- I
ping out," chuckles Alhouse. "Alter
the game the Trojans walked around
dazed until they came up with the
excuse that the lights bothered |
them. A few days later a package
containing 18 sun glasses was deliv
ered to the SC dressing room, com
pliments of Santa Barbara College." ]
Signed with Dodgers
Alhouse signed a Dodger contract t
in the summer of 1947 and held down
the keystone job with Santa Barbara
in the California State League
through the season of 1948. In 1949
he advanced to Class B ball at An
derson, S.C., where he hit . 2(55 and
was near the top of the league in
fielding.
His greatest day in baseball?
"That's easy," Alhouse passes off
modestly. "It was my first game as a
pro, and I was so nervous I forgot to
put my belt on. I was shaking in
my shoes at shortstop and threw two
of three balls over the first base
man's head early in the game, but I
was feeling steadier as the innings
rolled by.
"Then it happened. In the fifth in
ning I bent over for a grounder and
stepped toward second to start a
double play. My pants fell down
around rny knees, the second base
man stood on the bag laughing, and
I just stood there holding the ball."

"That's easy," Alhouse passes off
modestly. "It was my first game as a
pro, and I was so nervous I forgot to
put my belt on. I was shaking in
my shoes at shortstop and threw two
of three balls over the first base
man's head early in the game, but I
was feeling steadier as the innings
rolled by.
"Then it happened. In the fifth in
ning I bent over for a grounder and
stepped toward second to start a
double play. My pants fell down
around rny knees, the second base
man stood on the bag laughing, and
I just stood there holding the ball."

Nothing New
Handling ballplayers is not a new
experience for the young ex-Santa
Barbara Dodger second baseman.
Last summer lie managed the Class
D Gustonia, N.C., team to a last
place fini h.
In fairness to Bill, it should be in
serted that the team was dead last
when he took it over, arid was com
mitted to a money-saving policy of ,
playing local talent fresh out of high
school.
"This is the bett break I've had in
baseball," says Bill of his Stanford
job. Quite a break for Farm base- ■
bailers, too, it might be added, in |
getting the benefit of his recent pro j
experience.
The slightjy-built Alhouse started
his baseball career a A a catcher at
Stonybrook Prep, Long Island. He !
went on to Ho hart College for a se- !
mester before transferring to St. '
Mary's in the Navy Pre-flight pro
gram. Later he served at sea in the j
Pacific. While Bill was in the Navy, |
the Philadelphia Phillies' Cy Per
kins converted him to a shortstop.
Tripped Troy
Alhouse picked lip enough credits |
in the service to enter Santa Bar
bara College as a sophomore and win
the second base spot on the 1947 j
Gaucho outfit that embarrassed
mighty USC.
The Trojans that year had
amassed an imposing winning streak
against all comers, including several
major league teams in California for |
spring training, and breezed conde
scendingly into Santa Barbara for a
night game that promised little more
than a workout. The Gauchos were
high for the game, got ofr to a fast
start, and held off a desperate USC
rally to win.
"SC Coaches Barry and Dedeaux
sat on the bench with their eyes pop- I
ping out," chuckles Alhouse. "Alter
the game the Trojans walked around
dazed until they came up with the
excuse that the lights bothered |
them. A few days later a package
containing 18 sun glasses was deliv
ered to the SC dressing room, com
pliments of Santa Barbara College." ]
