DONS OUTNUMBERED—Four Stanford players are ready to take this high rebound in Satur
day night's Cow Palace game with USF. Jim Ramstead (10) seems to be the best bet to get the
ball, although SF's Cappy Lavin (10) may lift Jack O'Sullivan high enough to get the ball. In the
background are Stanford's Eddy Tucker (9), and a somewhat obscured Jim Walsh (with knee
pads). —Daily photo by Tom Peterson
