# COACHING DERBY
## Eliot Turns Down SC Job 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22 (UP) â€”
Ray Eliot of Illinois turned down the
football coaching job at Southern
California today, as the breach be
tween alumni and the university's
administration widened.
Eliot announced at Champaign,
111., that he had decided to remain
with the Big Ten school. The husky
Illinois coach said he was prompted
to turn down Southern California's
offer by a deluge of appeals that he
stay at Champaign.
There was little question that the
attitude of Trojan alumni, bitter
over the school's failure to make a
substantial offer to Paul Brown of
the Cleveland Browns, entered into
Eliot's consideration.
