# McElyea Number One As Golfers Head Into Season
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanlord s 1951 golt team will be
strong anil stands a chance of again '
winning the Pacific Coast Confer
| ence championship.
That was the opinion expressed by
Bud Finger, popular Stanford golf
coach and top - Hight professional
golfer.
Finger admits, however, that this
year's tetm will not be as good as
that of last year. The 1950 team won
the PCC title and was ranked third
nationally. Gone are Bud Moe, Bob
Crozier, and John Wallace, num- 1
bers one, four, and live respectively.
It was Moe, as vou recall, who
teamed up with professional Ralph
Bloomquist to tie for lirst place in
the pro - amateur division of last
year s bing Crosby Invitational Golf
! Tournament.
This spring, the following may be
j counted on to see plenty of action: »
Dick McElyea, a junior from Palo
Alto, will operate in the number one

,
| spot. McElyea .started out slowly last i
year anil was number three man for
most of the season, lie improved
rapidly, however, and by the end ol i
! the season lie was number one. He
went on to become Pacific Coast
j Conference champion and should
duplicate that performance this
| year.
Number two man will be Jack
Knoshcr, a senior from Naperville,
Illinois. Jack was number two on 1
last year's team and was ranked
third nationally.
Keith Beekman, a junior, will ;
1 probably be number three man.
Beekman was on the varsity last
year and was second only to McEl
yea on the 1949 freshman team.
In the number four spot will be
John Klliut. who was also a member
j of the 1950 varsity. As a junior lust j
year John ably filled in for Boh Cro- !
zier when Crozier was injured.

Number five nmn will be Kolanri
Conl'. 1 in. A sophomore, Koland was
number one man on last year's fresh
man team and is considered an out
standing prospect.
There is a four - way tie for the
number six spot. Bob Teitswovth, a
junior; Cully Ingrain, a soph; Paul
Palmquist, a junior, and Art Sell roe
<U'i\ a >60ph, will all be fighting lor
that spot,
Perhaps the key to Stanford's 1951
goll fortunes could be Dick Taylor,
a junior from Mc nlo JC. Taylor is
waiting for a conference ruling to
decide whether or not he will be
eligible this spring. Dick comes from
Arizona and was rated as one of the
greatest amateur golfers in the
Southwest.
The schedule is not definite yet
but two meets with Cal, two with
San Jose State, and one with USC.
UCLA, and the San Francisco Police
Department are certain. Tentative
meets include one with the Olympic-
Club and one with either Oregon or
Oregon State.
The San Francisco Police Depart
ment team may provide the stiflest
competition. Playing for them is

Ken Towns, former national cham
pion. They also have the runner-up
to Towns, twice national Public
Links champion and once San Fran
| cisco city champion.
UC LA will be the team for Stan
ford to beat in the PCC this year.
Number one golfer lor them is l(ay
Steelsmith, who was runner-lip in
last year's Southern California
Amateur Championship 'lotirna
; ment.
Dark horse will be USC, which
boasts two top-flight collegiate golf
ers in Roliert Davits and Holt Pa'stni.
Cal shouldn't be too tough, al
though they have Ted Hugs return
ing. Last year, as a soph, Ted was
defeated by McElyea in the finals of
j the PCC championship.
1 he Staniord yolf season wij], be
gin either in the last twn weeks ol
this quarter «>r during the spiin"
vacation.
Stanford has an eve to the fit-lure.
Ibis year's freshman team Intiy
prove to be one of the most juit
: .standing in the school's history.
Cvant Spaeth from Palo Afto and
Otis Winters from Oklahoma, at one
time two of the greatest junior ".oil
ers in the nation, will be numbers
one and two. Also rating top berths
will be John Roberts from Indiana,
Stewart Ledhetter, Oliver Thornton!
and Bob Sims, who is the son of a
I former Stanford football great. „
All Stanford goliers are now at a
j terrific handicap since the recent
j rainy weather has forced the Stan
ford course to temporarily 'c4o.se
down. Even the elementary iolf
I classes are being held indoors.

Stanlord s 1951 golt team will be
strong anil stands a chance of again '
winning the Pacific Coast Confer
| ence championship.
That was the opinion expressed by
Bud Finger, popular Stanford golf
coach and top - Hight professional
golfer.
Finger admits, however, that this
year's tetm will not be as good as
that of last year. The 1950 team won
the PCC title and was ranked third
nationally. Gone are Bud Moe, Bob
Crozier, and John Wallace, num- 1
bers one, four, and live respectively.
It was Moe, as vou recall, who
teamed up with professional Ralph
Bloomquist to tie for lirst place in
the pro - amateur division of last
year s bing Crosby Invitational Golf
! Tournament.
This spring, the following may be
j counted on to see plenty of action: »
Dick McElyea, a junior from Palo
Alto, will operate in the number one

,
| spot. McElyea .started out slowly last i
year anil was number three man for
most of the season, lie improved
rapidly, however, and by the end ol i
! the season lie was number one. He
went on to become Pacific Coast
j Conference champion and should
duplicate that performance this
| year.
Number two man will be Jack
Knoshcr, a senior from Naperville,
Illinois. Jack was number two on 1
last year's team and was ranked
third nationally.
Keith Beekman, a junior, will ;
1 probably be number three man.
Beekman was on the varsity last
year and was second only to McEl
yea on the 1949 freshman team.
In the number four spot will be
John Klliut. who was also a member
j of the 1950 varsity. As a junior lust j
year John ably filled in for Boh Cro- !
zier when Crozier was injured.

Number five nmn will be Kolanri
Conl'. 1 in. A sophomore, Koland was
number one man on last year's fresh
man team and is considered an out
standing prospect.
There is a four - way tie for the
number six spot. Bob Teitswovth, a
junior; Cully Ingrain, a soph; Paul
Palmquist, a junior, and Art Sell roe
<U'i\ a >60ph, will all be fighting lor
that spot,
Perhaps the key to Stanford's 1951
goll fortunes could be Dick Taylor,
a junior from Mc nlo JC. Taylor is
waiting for a conference ruling to
decide whether or not he will be
eligible this spring. Dick comes from
Arizona and was rated as one of the
greatest amateur golfers in the
Southwest.
The schedule is not definite yet
but two meets with Cal, two with
San Jose State, and one with USC.
UCLA, and the San Francisco Police
Department are certain. Tentative
meets include one with the Olympic-
Club and one with either Oregon or
Oregon State.
The San Francisco Police Depart
ment team may provide the stiflest
competition. Playing for them is

Ken Towns, former national cham
pion. They also have the runner-up

Beekman was on the varsity last
year and was second only to McEl
yea on the 1949 freshman team.
In the number four spot will be
John Klliut. who was also a member
j of the 1950 varsity. As a junior lust j
year John ably filled in for Boh Cro- !
zier when Crozier was injured.

Number five nmn will be Kolanri
Conl'. 1 in. A sophomore, Koland was
number one man on last year's fresh
man team and is considered an out
standing prospect.
There is a four - way tie for the
number six spot. Bob Teitswovth, a
junior; Cully Ingrain, a soph; Paul
Palmquist, a junior, and Art Sell roe
<U'i\ a >60ph, will all be fighting lor
that spot,
Perhaps the key to Stanford's 1951
goll fortunes could be Dick Taylor,
a junior from Mc nlo JC. Taylor is
waiting for a conference ruling to
decide whether or not he will be
eligible this spring. Dick comes from
Arizona and was rated as one of the
greatest amateur golfers in the
Southwest.
The schedule is not definite yet
but two meets with Cal, two with
San Jose State, and one with USC.
UCLA, and the San Francisco Police
Department are certain. Tentative
meets include one with the Olympic-
Club and one with either Oregon or
Oregon State.
The San Francisco Police Depart
ment team may provide the stiflest
competition. Playing for them is

Ken Towns, former national cham
pion. They also have the runner-up
to Towns, twice national Public
Links champion and once San Fran

UC LA will be the team for Stan
ford to beat in the PCC this year.
Number one golfer lor them is l(ay

last year's Southern California
Amateur Championship 'lotirna

Dark horse will be USC, which
boasts two top-flight collegiate golf
ers in Roliert Davits and Holt Pa'stni.

Stanlord s 1951 golt team will be
strong anil stands a chance of again '
winning the Pacific Coast Confer
| ence championship.
That was the opinion expressed by
Bud Finger, popular Stanford golf
coach and top - Hight professional
golfer.
Finger admits, however, that this
year's tetm will not be as good as
that of last year. The 1950 team won
the PCC title and was ranked third
nationally. Gone are Bud Moe, Bob
Crozier, and John Wallace, num- 1
bers one, four, and live respectively.
It was Moe, as vou recall, who
teamed up with professional Ralph
Bloomquist to tie for lirst place in
the pro - amateur division of last
year s bing Crosby Invitational Golf
! Tournament.
This spring, the following may be
j counted on to see plenty of action: »
Dick McElyea, a junior from Palo
Alto, will operate in the number one

,
| spot. McElyea .started out slowly last i
year anil was number three man for
most of the season, lie improved
rapidly, however, and by the end ol i
! the season lie was number one. He
went on to become Pacific Coast
j Conference champion and should
duplicate that performance this
| year.
Number two man will be Jack
Knoshcr, a senior from Naperville,
Illinois. Jack was number two on 1
last year's team and was ranked
third nationally.
Keith Beekman, a junior, will ;
1 probably be number three man.
Beekman was on the varsity last
year and was second only to McEl
yea on the 1949 freshman team.
