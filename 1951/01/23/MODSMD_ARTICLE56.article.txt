# Materials Shortage Hits Biz School Industrial Lab
## 
### 
One of the nation's smallest
! factories has been hit by one of
the nation's biggert problems.
Ihe Industrial Laboratory of Ihc
I Stanford Graduate School of Busi-
I ness, a going manufacturing conccrn
| which tuins out a new product each
i school year, has run afoul of stratc-
I gic materials shortages. The class,
direct -d by Frank K. Shallcnberner,
protestor of industrial management,
j is learning the hard way of today's
conversion problems of the mall
! manufacturer.
Unique among business schools in
j the country, the laboratory is plan- i
ned to provide practical training in j
I production processes, time studies, j
| methods improvement, and produc
tion management. It recreates in two
j small rooms, jammed with machinery
I and crammed into a corner of the
| Stanford campus, a realistic manu- j
I facturing plant atmosphere where :
future plant managers learn by do
ing. y
Last year, the class designed and
put into production 50 circular saws j
! on a "pilot-line" basis.
This year, skyrocketing costs of I
Alnico permanent magnets, widely
| used in electronics and in aircraft I
| equipment, have forced a cutback to j
i 250 in the laboratory's current proj- '
| ect of 500 tiny electric motors.
Each class manufacturing patent '
| is financed and consumed by the i
i students themselves.
These "pilot-line" projects expose '
j tudenls to production "bugs" famil- i
iar to businessmen. A student-dc
| veloped domestic food chopper was
[ abandoned when they found it in
fringed on patents held by a manu
facturer of restaurant equipment.
| Other classes in the Graduate \
School of Business also operate on
varied aspects of the laboratory's
manufacturing projects. They plan
the marketing, financing, and per- '
sonncl aspects. At this point, their
! similarity with commercial enter- i
j prise ends, for the production is j
! bought by the students themselves I
and there is no competition with
outside producers.
