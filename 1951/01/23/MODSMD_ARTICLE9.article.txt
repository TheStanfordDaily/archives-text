# Winbigler Is Optimistic About Draft Situation for Stanford Undergraduates
## 
### 
Draft-jittery students have an ex
ccllent chance to complete their un-
Jcrgraduate studies before induc
lion into the service, Dean of Stu
dents 11. Don Winhigler said last
week.
Winhigler, outlining the last
moving developments bearing on the
draft problem, said he thought the
chances that all potential 1-A men
would be allowed to finish school
were increasing rather than decreas
ing.
IMnrh depends, however, on the
outcome of the 18-year-old i raft
proposal now before the SenHte
Armed Services Committee,'' Win
biglcr cautioned.
"If the Army starts taking 18-
year-olds, it simply won't have room
for large numbers of college men.
Some 900,000 18-year-olds would be
come eligible under the Pentagon
plan.
"But if the proposal should fail, it
would be another story. The present
19-25 age group would have to sup
ply the men, and that would mean a
great many students would be draft
ed this summer," he said.
Winhigler remarked that he

thought at least a roinjv omise
form of the 18-vear-old draft plan
would become law.
" iding out the present crisis by
laying in school would certainly
eem the widest. course for men anx~
ous to finish their schooling," the
Dean said.
Much of Winhigler's optimism
concerning the chances for a com
pleted education stems from what lie
rails 'he near - universal agreement
immv' the nation's leaders that the
re:-e*it crisis is a long-term one,
that trie country must look ahead.
"All the many proposals for in
creasing the* nation's manpower are
based on the supposition that the
(low of technical and intellectual
leadership must not be cut off.
"In a long-term crisis, the strong
est possible force must necessarily
provide for a continuous flow of
skilled technicians, scientists, teach
ers, and other leaders. Only the uni
versity s can provide these men."
'Ibis, said Winhigler, is atrreed
by all. The difTcretire of opinion is
on bow the ideal is to be achieved.
Under the Pentagon plan now un
der considet ation, 75,000 18-year

)lds would be chosen for college
tucly after four months <>112 basic
training. In addition, ;Â»r> Ot'O men
would be chosen each year for
tOTC and NHOTC training
All of these programs would op"f
itc on an around - the - calendar
chedule, no lime out for summer
vacation.
Winhiglcr .'.aid he was oTten asked
whether o? not draft ofTicials would
make any distinction between stu-
Icnts in scientific and technical
fields and those in non - scientific
studies.
"Owe again I refer to the lang
ti in aspect cf the emergency," the
Dean said.
"On the undergraduate level, it
would seem extremely unwise to
make deferments solely on the basis
of major feld. Abo. it. is difficult to
know whr.t type of college - trained
specialist may be in demand during
war-time "
Winbigler said that the same view
is held by most educators. He added
that a recommendation to that effect
had been included in the Trytten
Committee report to Selective Serv
ice Director Lewis TV Hot hew
