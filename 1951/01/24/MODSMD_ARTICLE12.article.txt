"I HATE MY DRAFT BOARD" These were the words of farewell from David R. Jacobson, grad
uate student, as he boarded a train for Fort Ord Monday night. The first resident of Stanfoid
Village to receive the call to arms via selective service, he was given a sendoff by a small group of
friends as he got on the train at Menlo Park. Jacobson, whose home is Jackson Fleights, N.Y.,
received his physical lard September, but was able to secure a postponement while he was d oing
graduate work in creative writing. He did not enroll in Stanford winter quarter because of lack
of funds, thus giving the army a chance to call him up. Daily Photo by Tom Peterson.
