# 'No More Meetings,' Says Close; ACLU Raps Student Actions
## 
### JOY HAAS 
Donald E. Close told the Daily last night that he "did not pro
pose to sponsor any further meetings."
In a letter to the editor (see page 2) regarding the meeting be
sponsored in Palo Alto Monday night, Close stated that he did
not subscribe to "any doctrine of racial or religious persecution,"

and he said that he had insisted that
Dr. Wesley Swift omit any attacks on
racial or religious groups.
In a statement from the Stanford
Chapter of the American Civil Lib
erties Union, which was responsible
for the lackground material on
Swift, the Executive Committee
stated:
"The Stanford Chapter of ACLU
would like again to reiterate their
basic policy that any person, no mat
ter what his political opinions, has
the right to the public platform.
"We would further like to register
our disapproval of the action of some
Stanford students at Monday night's
meeting in encouraging action that
was disruptive. We would add, how
ever, that Mr. Swift did no't fulfill his
part of the democratic contract when

he refused to answer questions at the
meeting, or to guarantee that ques
tions would ho permitted later,"
There seemed to he a consensus by
many who attended Swift's sporadic
talk on "Secret Government in
America" that the Sunday Evening
Movie crowd had moved flown "en
masse."
A few observations from people at
tending the meeting are as follows:
George Cowgill, Toyon, sophomore
-"My personal impression was that
during the first half of the meeting,
students were not making too con
structive criticisms. However, it
Swift really had the facts to hack up
his statements, he would have surely
been able to answer student ques
t ions."
Mrs. Ellene Sumner, Encina Resi
dence director "Had Swift had any
thing constructive to present, he
could have held his audience. His
talk, was not on the level that the
tudents could appreciate. Some of
the actions were perhaps regrettable
but they were understandable."
Don KautTman, graduate student.
Village—'"My personal opinion is that
the students were pretty hepped on
the idea that they were going In
heckle the speaker. He really didn't
gel a chance to commit himself, I
would like to hear him again,
frankly.
"It wasn't Dr. Swift that sent those
kids there. It was the name Donald
Close."
Dave Workman. Stern, junior "I
dcn'l think that the audience reac
tion indicates their true views on
Swift s subject. Most of them were
from Stanford which is conservative.
Just one look at the election polls
which indicate that the students arc
anti-administration."

the right to the public platform.
"We would further like to register
our disapproval of the action of some
Stanford students at Monday night's
meeting in encouraging action that
was disruptive. We would add, how
ever, that Mr. Swift did no't fulfill his
part of the democratic contract when

he refused to answer questions at the
meeting, or to guarantee that ques
tions would ho permitted later,"
There seemed to he a consensus by
many who attended Swift's sporadic
talk on "Secret Government in
America" that the Sunday Evening
Movie crowd had moved flown "en
masse."
A few observations from people at
tending the meeting are as follows:
George Cowgill, Toyon, sophomore
-"My personal impression was that
during the first half of the meeting,
students were not making too con
structive criticisms. However, it
Swift really had the facts to hack up
his statements, he would have surely
been able to answer student ques
t ions."
Mrs. Ellene Sumner, Encina Resi
dence director "Had Swift had any
thing constructive to present, he
could have held his audience. His
talk, was not on the level that the
tudents could appreciate. Some of
the actions were perhaps regrettable
but they were understandable."
Don KautTman, graduate student.
Village—'"My personal opinion is that
the students were pretty hepped on
the idea that they were going In
heckle the speaker. He really didn't
gel a chance to commit himself, I
would like to hear him again,
frankly.
"It wasn't Dr. Swift that sent those
kids there. It was the name Donald
Close."
Dave Workman. Stern, junior "I
dcn'l think that the audience reac
tion indicates their true views on
Swift s subject. Most of them were
from Stanford which is conservative.
Just one look at the election polls
which indicate that the students arc
anti-administration."
Donald E. Close told the Daily last night that he "did not pro
pose to sponsor any further meetings."
In a letter to the editor (see page 2) regarding the meeting be
sponsored in Palo Alto Monday night, Close stated that he did
not subscribe to "any doctrine of racial or religious persecution,"

and he said that he had insisted that
Dr. Wesley Swift omit any attacks on
racial or religious groups.
In a statement from the Stanford
Chapter of the American Civil Lib
erties Union, which was responsible
for the lackground material on
Swift, the Executive Committee
stated:
