# Students May Enlist Until Induction Police Received
## 
### 
Students may now enlist in a service of their choice, or in a
branch which is open, at any time before they receive their actual
induction notice.
If a student has already received his induction order, ho is
longer free to volunteer for an open service branch, regardless

of his deferment status. ♦
This clarification of the new Do- i
fensc Department ruling published \
in Monday's Daily was marie known
yesterday by Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler and Chief Coun
selor for Men Richard L. Balch.
The ruling published Monday
.stated that students were eligible to
enlist iu a branch of their choice in
the two months prior to the last
month of the quarter, but did not
say whether or not the ruling was
retroactive and applicable to men
already classified.
Induction Notice
In view of the clarification Dean
Winbigler and Balch received from
the Defense Department yesterday,
the now critical point governing the
student's right to volunteer centers
around the actual induction notice,
the order to report for duty.
Prior to this week, anyone getting
his pre-induction notice—the order
to report for a physical examination
—was no longer able to select his
branch of the service.
Thus a new and extended length
of time during which men are free
to enlist is created. Students may
even pass their physicals and still be
free to enlist, provided they have
not received their induction no
tices.
Washington Phone Call
Dean Winbigler was able to get
the clarification after phoning the
office of the Secretary of Defense in
Washington. The office said that the
new order, made by Secretary of
Defense Marshall, voiced the old
ruling which had been an intcr
; service agreement not to r.cccpt en
listments.
Balch spoke earlier with the Se
lective Service headquarters in
Washington, but was told that the
i Selective Service 1 office had nothing
to do with the new.ruling.
Balch pointed mil that local draff
board policy, in some cases, would
now be Hie deciding factor.
"The crtiical question is whether
or not the boards will send out in
duction notices." he aid.
' Any iMan now enrolled in the
University who rorehes the age of
in should request a letter from the
Counseling Office certifying his at
tendance in school." Balch said.
Santa Clara County draft co-ordi
nator Mrs. Lillian Krigbaum siir!
ye terday that she thought hoard
would be "very lenient" toward col
lege students and would permit
them to choose their own branch of
»crvic?.
A Few l\\amplrs
Balch listerl several examples of
how the new ruling works. Students
with the following st ttuses would h<
eligible to enlist:
1- A Enrollment certificate, no
phy ical taken.
I-A-P Passed ph; .ical and given
rating without induction papers
Students with these statuses would
not he eligible:

ceivcd induction pap- r . then "0'
