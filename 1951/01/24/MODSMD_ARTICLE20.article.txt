# A 						Delegate to Rome

### 
People who opposu the idea of the -ASSU
sending a delegate to the Rome peace congress
"ire quick to produce the "John Pool folly" out
of the back of their thinking caps.
It was in April, 1949 that Excom approved a
BSQO appropriation from the Daily funds so Stu
ient Manager Pool could hop back to Yale and
nvestigate a mysterious new printing device
.•mown as the varitype idea. The SSOC was
3pent, and there was much criticism from the
student body. t
However in the Rome proposal slated lor Ex
:om's consideration tonight, there is a worth
while cause- much different from the Pool
Folly. It deserves some, if not complete fi
nancial support.
Pool's trip was a shot in the dark. There was
only an outside chance that the Daily might be
tible to use the new varitype.
However the Rome congress represents an
attempt by educators and students to work for
peace through a world government and con
stitution. It is a good gamble for our student
ibody, as well as for all American students, be
cause much is to be gained if high-class dele
•tj.ites can delve into world problems from a
fresh angle.
* Pool's plan turned into a free trip for one
man.
The current proposal should be accompanied
by a recommendation from Excom that some
student be chosen by ballot to serve as dele
xja-te.
Pool s idea was pulled out of thin air with no
particular basis or precedent to back it up.

If Excom should decide in favor of sending
a delegate, Stanford would be continuing its
favorable attitude toward international under
standing, and lIR activity.
Hence the decision hinges, not on Stanford's
interest in the congress as such, but rather on
the financial strings attached.
Only $425 of the budgeted S3lOO ASSU Con
tingency Fund has been allocated so far. How
ever, before Excom can take a S6OO slice out of
the remaining piece of pie, there are some
things to be considered.
First, would the Stanford students benefit as
much from $600 applied to the expenses of the
Rome trip, as they would from $600 added to
the lIR, Rally Com, Cardinals, or AWS pro
grams?
There is great value in sending a representa
tive to the Rome Congress. It would prove to
foreign students at the congress that American
students and universities are interested in more
than this side of the world. It would convince
other nations that there is more behind our
CARE packages than mere gifts and money.
When the delegate returns to Stanford in
April, his information could furnish valuable
material for Stanford forums.
However it is possible that Excom will not
consider these benefits valuable enough to
merit an appropriation of $600. They might
well consider a compromise allocation of $300-
400 with a recommendation for some sponsor
ing group to raise the remainder by benefit
programs.

sending a delegate to the Rome peace congress
"ire quick to produce the "John Pool folly" out
of the back of their thinking caps.
It was in April, 1949 that Excom approved a
BSQO appropriation from the Daily funds so Stu
ient Manager Pool could hop back to Yale and
nvestigate a mysterious new printing device
.•mown as the varitype idea. The SSOC was
3pent, and there was much criticism from the
student body. t
However in the Rome proposal slated lor Ex
:om's consideration tonight, there is a worth
while cause- much different from the Pool
Folly. It deserves some, if not complete fi
nancial support.
Pool's trip was a shot in the dark. There was
only an outside chance that the Daily might be
tible to use the new varitype.
However the Rome congress represents an
attempt by educators and students to work for
peace through a world government and con
stitution. It is a good gamble for our student
ibody, as well as for all American students, be
cause much is to be gained if high-class dele
•tj.ites can delve into world problems from a
fresh angle.
* Pool's plan turned into a free trip for one
man.
The current proposal should be accompanied
by a recommendation from Excom that some
student be chosen by ballot to serve as dele
xja-te.
Pool s idea was pulled out of thin air with no
particular basis or precedent to back it up.

If Excom should decide in favor of sending
a delegate, Stanford would be continuing its
favorable attitude toward international under
standing, and lIR activity.
Hence the decision hinges, not on Stanford's
interest in the congress as such, but rather on
the financial strings attached.
Only $425 of the budgeted S3lOO ASSU Con
tingency Fund has been allocated so far. How
ever, before Excom can take a S6OO slice out of
the remaining piece of pie, there are some
things to be considered.
First, would the Stanford students benefit as
much from $600 applied to the expenses of the
Rome trip, as they would from $600 added to
the lIR, Rally Com, Cardinals, or AWS pro
grams?
There is great value in sending a representa
tive to the Rome Congress. It would prove to
foreign students at the congress that American
students and universities are interested in more
than this side of the world. It would convince
other nations that there is more behind our
CARE packages than mere gifts and money.
When the delegate returns to Stanford in
April, his information could furnish valuable
material for Stanford forums.
However it is possible that Excom will not
consider these benefits valuable enough to
merit an appropriation of $600. They might
well consider a compromise allocation of $300-
400 with a recommendation for some sponsor
ing group to raise the remainder by benefit
programs.
