# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
Lite was very depressng until yesterday. The rain
was depressing . . . the .draft was depressing
. . . classes were depressing ... I couldn't even get
a luck out of writing my own* name ovar and over.
Then, Donald E. Close came into my life, Suddenly

thole was something to talk about,
something to laugh about. Life
h.irt new meaning. I no longer
wanted to commit suicide by
! it kin : up isolationist posters in
th<*llH office.
Yes, Donald has become very
dear to nit. I wish to hear no
unkind words ,sljout Donald. In
ruy book he's the greatest thing to

hit this campus since Marvin O. Adams stopped writ
ing letters to tiie editor.
O! course, Donald didn't win my heart overnight.
His name first began to have a ulad ring in my ears
â€¢' onie time ago. when he demonstrated so convincingly
tht- Mibvernive nature of the Health Service. This is
too wonderful, I thought. I!' he keeps this up I'll stay
ii college indefinitely.
Then a couple oi Excomers came up with something
new. It seems Donald had pu: in his usual appearance
;t a Wedne-d .y ni"ht meetini- in his role as watchdog
of the people. Cardinals had just announced their
; ;real coming atti action, and for these two clowns the
temptation was just to great to resist.

They cornered him after the meeting. "Donald,"
they asked, "have you heard that Cardinals is spon
soring a so-called Louis Armstrong to appear in the
Pavilion?" And that they are paying him out of ASSU
funds tor the benefit of a certain clearly defined mi
nority?"
"Why. I haven't heard of this Louis Armstrong,"
came the excited reply.
"Don t you think the whole thin;* ought to be inves
tigated?" they asked.
"It certainly should Donald said. "I'll look into the
matter immediately."
Well, it's things like that that bring a touch of glad
ness to young bov s heart, and I began to cherish
Donald with all my heart.
And now, just when I needed something so badly to
kill the pain of that next tuition payment, what hap
pens? Donald sponsors a meeting!
Well, you see what I mean. Where would I be with
out Donald Where could I find something to brighten
these cold, dreary midwinter days like Donald can?
What will happen to me if he changes his attitude ail I
quiets down?
No. Donald, please. Don't give up. The watchdog of
the people can not givt up. So the meeting wasn't a
success. There are plenty of other things wrong
around here. How about this name-changing deal for
Cu'oberley? Stillman House? Don't I recall the
maiden name of Lenin's mother was StillovichV Get
on it. Donald. For my sake.
