To I!h Editor:
In .hi effort to end a situation which has assumed
latin, r unpleasant if not dangerous proportions, I sub
in; i the following statement:
1. In iward to my letter ol hut year concerning the
Stanford Health Service, upon further investigation, I
l« <• I that I was wrong in the conclusions reached. The
Health Serv ice is a type of insurance for the student
body, exactly the type of thing that will prevent so
l iali/.ition of the medical profession.
2. lit garding the meeting which I sponsored in Palo
Alto on Monday. I invited Dr. Swift to talk on the
question of Communism. I do not subscribe to any
doctiine of racial or relieious persecution, and I in
si ted that Dr. Swift omit from his speech any attacks
in racial or religious groups.
I fed ihat racial or religious prejudice is entirely
in< (insistent with the spirit of the founders of Amer
ica.
ii. As lai as Swift's lit injj ;> member of tlie Ku
i\.iu> Klan or hmv other Midi organization. I investi
gated that iiefore inviting him here to speak.
IJi Swift denied such affiliations and I found no evi
dence to support them. With this letter goes my most
profound hope that any who have been offended by
any effort which I have undertaken will find it within
their hearts to forgive me.
