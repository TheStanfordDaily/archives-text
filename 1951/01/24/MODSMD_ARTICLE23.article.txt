To the Editor:
Stud nt 1 - are expected to show both within and
without Ihe University such respect to order, morality
pf i ■ <>n.il honor, and the rights of others as is demand* d
ol : (,od citizens." Blandly we refer to this a.- the
Kuitolumental Standard.
feu students who heard VVeslej A. Swift Mondn>
nl<(h( evprcted to a(i'«r with his opinions. They got
what they looked for—his speech wits killed, a vic
tim of premeditated murder, and the rights of others
mentioned l»v Dr. David Starr Jordan in the Funda
mental Standard were ridiculed in rounds of Imis-
Xcrous Intighte.r.
Doubtl-'ss Edward Mi Nail Hums would not have
u <1 Mr. Swift't ideas even in his History of Western
t 'ivili/at ions

Bui when students whom Mr. Swot termed "the
most discourteous" he had ever addressed, cheered this
statement. they openly ridiculed our "Fundamental
Standard."
We heartily disagree with Mr. Swilt's views, hut
we were ashamed to think that such ridicule demon
strated student attitude toward the Fundamental
Standard that night.
Sincerely.
