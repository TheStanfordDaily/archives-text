'I o Mr. Clo: e:
For the past two years you have enjoyed the five
dum of our picas and (he unlimited power of the
spoken word here at Stanford University for the pur
pose of expressing your opinions and views on racial,
economic, and governmental problems. I shall not call
your theories those of the Fascists, as others have done,
for I know not whether they are indeed Fuscistic in na
ture.
In fact, though several attempts have been made on
your personal safety, and though there have been sev
eral contradictory and defamatory replies to your
statements which attempted to create a name for your
self here at Stanford, they have nevertheless been
nothing more than futil attempts.
The reasonâ€”not because people are afraid of you
or your ideas, hut because we all know only too well
that such attacks only make you a martyr to your
nwn cause. Hut Mr. Close, people sometimes lose
their sense of balance and ferget themselves, so I
suggest that you do either one of two things.
1. Leavt this University in search of a habitat where
you may practice your theories among peaceful acqui
escent friends, (or)
2. That you put aside your theories of racial preju
dice. one people inheriting all that is best in the world,
and study quietly and sincerely all that learning
which you must have missed essentially, the Itible.
Learn to love Lhv neighbor and more presentable theo
ries on the improvement of modern clay life.
