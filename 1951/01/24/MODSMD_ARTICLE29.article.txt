# IFC Prexy, Balch Greet Pledge Class
## 
### 
To the New Pledges of Fraternities:
You have joined a fraternity dur
ing a period of uncertain times.
There is much that you will be able
to contribute to the group with whom
you will presumably be living for
the next four years.
Merely accepting the pledge pin is
not a tulfillment of vour obligation
as a member of a fraternity living
group. At the time of accepting a
pledge, you accept the challenge to
make the particular house you have
joined one of the outstanding, if no I
the outstanding, living group on tht
campus. 11 your fraternity does not
contribute generally to the welfare
of Stanford University as an educa
tional institution, you have not met
the challenge that you accept as a
potential member.
I look forward to working with you
and helping you in any wii" I can to
make your contribution both to the
living group and to Stanford Uni
vtrsity an outstanding one.
RICHARD L. BALCH. '
Chief Counselor for Men
' I'd like to congratulate each one
of you new pledges on your choice
of a fraternity. There are many ad
vantages to be enjoyed in a small
living group, and I'm sure you will
be able to profit a great deal from
your fraternity experience.
"Your pledge class is one of the
largest and most important in Stan
| ford fraternity history. Because of
the present uncertain world situa
tion your class will have to assume
a lot of responsibility in the various
houses. It is up to you to assume
this responsibility conscientiously,
and to face the problems that will
; arise scjuarely, in order to maintain
1 fraternities as an integral part of
Stanford life."
