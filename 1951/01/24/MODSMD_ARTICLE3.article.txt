I,,\KE SI'CCKSS. N.Y., Jan. 21!
The Asian - Arab bloc decided to
night to put before the United Na
tions a resolution calling for a con
ference to iron out difficulties bar
rjng a cease-fire in Korea.
Informed sources said the resolu
tion would be circulated to delega
tions outside the 12 - nation Asian
group tomorrow morning for their
comment.
The move came as the United
States and Britain seemed headed
for a showdown on the American
demand that the UN immediately
find the Chinese Communists guilty
of aggression.
