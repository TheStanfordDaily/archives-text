Although Stanford": basketball teams have not been too impressive of late,
the Indian-, were the last PCC team and the only one evef 1 from the Southern
Division to win an NCAA crown. They accomplished this feat in 1942 by
defeating Oregon State in the FCC playoffs, then going on the whip Hice
53 to 47, Colorado 4(! to 3.), and Dartmouth 53 to 38. Their over-all season
record was 27 wins, 4 losses. . . Only other PCC ever to win the national
championship was Oregon in 1939.

There have keen mighty few three-time All Americans. In basketball
they're almost as rare as the duck-billed platypus. Only one ever to make
ii from the Pacific Coast was—you guessed it—Stanford's Hank Luisetti. He
received the honors in 1930, 1937. and 1938. Although most of the records
that he set have now been broken, at the end of his playing days in 1938
he owned nearly every basketball mark then in existence.

There have been many'stories told about fabulous Hank, but one of the
most typical as well as the best is that of how he was tricked into scoring
50 points against Duquesne one night. Hank was never a glory hound, and
though he was an excellent shot would rather pass the ball to one of his
teammates driving in under the basket than shoot it himself.
The afternoan before the Duquesm? game Hank's teammates got to
gether and decided they would fix him once and for all. So that night as
the Indians came roaring down the floor Luisetti passed the ball to Art
Slo ■ft n, the Card center. Stoefen promptly passed it back to llank.
Thinking that Stoefen had been guarded too well to take a shot, Luisetti
dribbled a couple of times, then passed the ball back to him. But Stoefen
was not to be so easily taken and spun the ball into Hank's mitts again.
This ho disconcerted Luisetti that he dropped a hook shot* in a for a field
goal.
The next time the Cards gained possession of the ball the same thing hap
pened. Luisetti fed the ball to Howie Turner, and Turner gave it back to
Hank, who in the sheer interest of self-preservation was finally forced to
shoot.
Alter a few minutes of this with Luisetti amassing more and more points
he called time cut and protested, "Hey, fellers, cut it out!" but it was too late.
They had Hank on the hook and helpless, and every time he passed the
ball they passed it rght back to him. By the end of the evening he had
scored 50 points and set a new record, the most reluctant record ever made
by a ballplayer.
♦ * *
Sudden thought . . . With the controversy between the wide open game
and control-style basketball flaring anew, wonder how many people know
it was the "Laughing Boys'' of Hank Luisetti's era who first broke the ice.
Control was then considered to be the prime essence of the game, and scores
in the 2()'s and 30's were the rule rather than the exception. But that was
before Hank and the boys went east to Madison Square Garden to meet LIU.
Long Island, working on a 44-game winning streak, was heavily favored.
They used the conventional Eastern two-handed set shot, at that time con
sidered to be the only proper one. Well, Hank and the boys, working out of
Ihe predecessor of what is now the fast break, showed them a few one
handed shots, and by the time it was all over another one of sport's great
upsets had been registered/ The score was Stanford 49. LIU 43. The next
night after the Indians swamped another top eastern team, CCNY. 49 to 35.
control-style basketball was on its way out. and the two-handed set shot
was as dead as the dodo.

Around the circuit . . When Kentucky downed Tennessee, 70 to 45, a
couple of night ago, it was the 93rd consecutive victory without defeat for
the Wildcats on their home court in Lexington. LlU's Blackbirds, which
make an appearance at the Cow Palace this weekend, have a streak of 129
on their home grounds, but they haven't met the caliber of opposition the
Kentuckians have. . , .
And if you think a lot of fouls are being called these days on the Pa
cific Coast, how about the 72 that were whistled in the game between
Notre Dame and Loyola of Chicago? If that still doesn't impress you,
when the Oklahoma Ags defeated Drake. 72 to 70. in three overtime pe
riods. all live starters on both sides—lo men in all—fouled out.

Strange happenings on the courts ... A couple of years ago Harvard was
playing Trinity in Hartford, Conn. The game proceeded normally enough
but then . . . the gun went off, and the game had apparently .ended with
Harvard ahead by a score of 47 to 45. Yet there was an overtime period, and
when that overtime period began Trinity was the team ahead, 48 to 47.
Here's how it happened. With one second to go in the regulation
period, a Trinity player drove in for a shot, and was fouled in the act of
shooting. The referee awarded him 2 shots, and he made both. This tied
the core at 47-all, and the teams returned to the lloar for the overtime
period. I iien. before it had a chance to start, the Harvard coach made
cci tail: choice remarks about the referee's ability, eyesight, and ancestry,
and the harassed official called a technical foul on him. The Trinity
player made the shot, and the score became 48 for Trinity, and 17 for
Harvard.
As if that wen not enough, with time running out in the overtime period,
Trintv was ahead 55 to 54. The seconds ticked off, the time-keeper pulled
the trigger on the gun to signalize the end of the game, and nothing hap
pened. A Harvard player drove in for a field goal, the ball went through the
basket; score, Harvard 50. Trinity 55. The time-keeper pulled the trigger
again, and the gun went off, and everyone thought that Harvard had won.
But wait! Actually the game had ended before the goal was made. There
was a hurried consultation between the officials. Trinity was declared the
winner, 55 to 54.
The people in Hartford are still shaking their heads.

There have keen mighty few three-time All Americans. In basketball
they're almost as rare as the duck-billed platypus. Only one ever to make
ii from the Pacific Coast was—you guessed it—Stanford's Hank Luisetti. He
received the honors in 1930, 1937. and 1938. Although most of the records
that he set have now been broken, at the end of his playing days in 1938
he owned nearly every basketball mark then in existence.

There have been many'stories told about fabulous Hank, but one of the
most typical as well as the best is that of how he was tricked into scoring
50 points against Duquesne one night. Hank was never a glory hound, and
though he was an excellent shot would rather pass the ball to one of his
teammates driving in under the basket than shoot it himself.
The afternoan before the Duquesm? game Hank's teammates got to
gether and decided they would fix him once and for all. So that night as
the Indians came roaring down the floor Luisetti passed the ball to Art
Slo ■ft n, the Card center. Stoefen promptly passed it back to llank.
Thinking that Stoefen had been guarded too well to take a shot, Luisetti
dribbled a couple of times, then passed the ball back to him. But Stoefen
was not to be so easily taken and spun the ball into Hank's mitts again.
This ho disconcerted Luisetti that he dropped a hook shot* in a for a field
goal.
The next time the Cards gained possession of the ball the same thing hap
pened. Luisetti fed the ball to Howie Turner, and Turner gave it back to
Hank, who in the sheer interest of self-preservation was finally forced to
shoot.
Alter a few minutes of this with Luisetti amassing more and more points
he called time cut and protested, "Hey, fellers, cut it out!" but it was too late.
They had Hank on the hook and helpless, and every time he passed the
ball they passed it rght back to him. By the end of the evening he had
scored 50 points and set a new record, the most reluctant record ever made
by a ballplayer.

it was the "Laughing Boys'' of Hank Luisetti's era who first broke the ice.

in the 2()'s and 30's were the rule rather than the exception. But that was

Strange happenings on the courts ... A couple of years ago Harvard was
playing Trinity in Hartford, Conn. The game proceeded normally enough
but then . . . the gun went off, and the game had apparently .ended with
Harvard ahead by a score of 47 to 45. Yet there was an overtime period, and
when that overtime period began Trinity was the team ahead, 48 to 47.
Here's how it happened. With one second to go in the regulation
period, a Trinity player drove in for a shot, and was fouled in the act of
shooting. The referee awarded him 2 shots, and he made both. This tied
the core at 47-all, and the teams returned to the lloar for the overtime
period. I iien. before it had a chance to start, the Harvard coach made
cci tail: choice remarks about the referee's ability, eyesight, and ancestry,
and the harassed official called a technical foul on him. The Trinity
player made the shot, and the score became 48 for Trinity, and 17 for
Harvard.
As if that wen not enough, with time running out in the overtime period,
Trintv was ahead 55 to 54. The seconds ticked off, the time-keeper pulled
the trigger on the gun to signalize the end of the game, and nothing hap
pened. A Harvard player drove in for a field goal, the ball went through the
basket; score, Harvard 50. Trinity 55. The time-keeper pulled the trigger
again, and the gun went off, and everyone thought that Harvard had won.
But wait! Actually the game had ended before the goal was made. There
was a hurried consultation between the officials. Trinity was declared the
winner, 55 to 54.
The people in Hartford are still shaking their heads.

There have keen mighty few three-time All Americans. In basketball
they're almost as rare as the duck-billed platypus. Only one ever to make
ii from the Pacific Coast was—you guessed it—Stanford's Hank Luisetti. He
received the honors in 1930, 1937. and 1938. Although most of the records
that he set have now been broken, at the end of his playing days in 1938
he owned nearly every basketball mark then in existence.

There have been many'stories told about fabulous Hank, but one of the
most typical as well as the best is that of how he was tricked into scoring
50 points against Duquesne one night. Hank was never a glory hound, and
though he was an excellent shot would rather pass the ball to one of his
teammates driving in under the basket than shoot it himself.
The afternoan before the Duquesm? game Hank's teammates got to
gether and decided they would fix him once and for all. So that night as
the Indians came roaring down the floor Luisetti passed the ball to Art
Slo ■ft n, the Card center. Stoefen promptly passed it back to llank.
Thinking that Stoefen had been guarded too well to take a shot, Luisetti
dribbled a couple of times, then passed the ball back to him. But Stoefen
was not to be so easily taken and spun the ball into Hank's mitts again.
This ho disconcerted Luisetti that he dropped a hook shot* in a for a field
goal.
The next time the Cards gained possession of the ball the same thing hap
pened. Luisetti fed the ball to Howie Turner, and Turner gave it back to
Hank, who in the sheer interest of self-preservation was finally forced to
shoot.
Alter a few minutes of this with Luisetti amassing more and more points
he called time cut and protested, "Hey, fellers, cut it out!" but it was too late.
They had Hank on the hook and helpless, and every time he passed the
ball they passed it rght back to him. By the end of the evening he had
scored 50 points and set a new record, the most reluctant record ever made
by a ballplayer.

Sudden thought . . . With the controversy between the wide open game
and control-style basketball flaring anew, wonder how many people know
it was the "Laughing Boys'' of Hank Luisetti's era who first broke the ice.

in the 2()'s and 30's were the rule rather than the exception. But that was

Strange happenings on the courts ... A couple of years ago Harvard was
playing Trinity in Hartford, Conn. The game proceeded normally enough
but then . . . the gun went off, and the game had apparently .ended with
Harvard ahead by a score of 47 to 45. Yet there was an overtime period, and
when that overtime period began Trinity was the team ahead, 48 to 47.
Here's how it happened. With one second to go in the regulation
period, a Trinity player drove in for a shot, and was fouled in the act of
shooting. The referee awarded him 2 shots, and he made both. This tied
the core at 47-all, and the teams returned to the lloar for the overtime
period. I iien. before it had a chance to start, the Harvard coach made
cci tail: choice remarks about the referee's ability, eyesight, and ancestry,
and the harassed official called a technical foul on him. The Trinity
player made the shot, and the score became 48 for Trinity, and 17 for
Harvard.
As if that wen not enough, with time running out in the overtime period,
Trintv was ahead 55 to 54. The seconds ticked off, the time-keeper pulled
the trigger on the gun to signalize the end of the game, and nothing hap
pened. A Harvard player drove in for a field goal, the ball went through the
basket; score, Harvard 50. Trinity 55. The time-keeper pulled the trigger
again, and the gun went off, and everyone thought that Harvard had won.
But wait! Actually the game had ended before the goal was made. There
was a hurried consultation between the officials. Trinity was declared the
winner, 55 to 54.
The people in Hartford are still shaking their heads.
