# PAVILION CLASH
## J.V.'s to Tangle With Unbeaten Frosh Today 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's basketballing Braves
take to the war path again this af
ternoon, when they tangle with their
younger brothers, the Papooses, in
the Pavilion at 4. The game will be
official in every capacity.
Today's game has worked up more
interest among students and players
alike than many previous junior var
sity and frosh encounters against
outside opponents. To put it bluntly,
the frosh are out to teach the JV's a
lesson in basketball fundamentals.
The Braves, for obvious reasons, will
attempt to squelch a successful year
ling uprising.
The brilliant, undefeated frosh
confidently place their eight - win
record on the block against a Brave
squad with a mediocre record. The
proud Braves are likewise confident
of a win. However, their confidence
is not based on the merit of their
four - win, three - loss record, but
rather on that ancient criterion, ex
perience.
The Braves find their experience
in men such as Dan Evans, George
Zaninovich, Fritz Fenster, Bill Ste
venson, Paul Johnson, Tom DuFour,
and Dan Wilbur.
The well-rounded frosh squad is
going after a win, which would give
the '54's more satisfaction than any
other seasonal victory, with the pos
sible exception of the Cal frosh tri
umphs.
Following the mid-week encoun
ter, the Braves meet a Hamilton
Field five in the Pavilion Saturday
afternoon. The frosh return to th jir
high school schedule, tangling with
Lincoln High School of San Fran
cisco on Friday and Alameda High
on Saturday.
Probable starting lineup:
BRAVES FROSH
Dan Evans 112 Don DeLong
Paul Johnson 112 Hal Ellis
Bill Stevenson c Dave Epperson
Fritz Fenster g Oleg Suzdaleflf
Geo. Zaninovich g Don Carlson
