# Legal Frat Wins 64 to 7
## 
### 
Delta Theta Phi, led by Dave Me- ;
nary, proved more than a match for i
Village 308 last night winning by a
lopsided score of 04 to 7 in the Stan- !
ford Pavilion.
With no reserves, the Villagers j
were forced to play their starting 1
five the entire game, but couldn't
keep up with the fast pace set by the
legal-beagles. An average of four j
inches taller per man was another I
disadvantage that the 308's could not
overcome.
The Delta Theta Phi's kept their
center, Conrad Gullixson, under the
bucket most of the game, where he
took a decisive command of the
backboards, scoring a total of 16
points.
Throughout the entire game the i
Village team had little chance to
score because the attorneys - to-be
controlled the ball with a remark
ably efficient offense. Mennry led
the Delta Theta Phi's with 30 points, !
and Bill Hollingsworth scored 14.
In a typically fast - break game,
Toyon I downed Encina Center, 48
to 26.
