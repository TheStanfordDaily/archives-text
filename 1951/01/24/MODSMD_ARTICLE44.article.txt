WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UP) â€”
The era of the 4-F athlete who was
, largely responsible for keeping pro
-1 fessional sports in operation
throughout World War II may be
coming to an end, Defense Secretary
George C. Marshall disclosed today,
i Marshall made it plain in a discus
! sion before the House Armed Serv
ices Committee that athletes healthy
j enough to participate in sports
events no longer are likely to be

deferred because of physical defects.
Kep. Charles H. Elston, R., Ohio,
commented that in the past many
players in professional baseball and
football had been ruled out of the
military draft because of limited
physical disabilities and wondered it'
the same situation would prevail
again.
"I don't think there wiil be any
repetition of that," Marshall said.
Witnesses of the Defense Depart
ment will make a specific report la
ter on what steps they will take to
put 4-F athletes into limited military
.service, Marshall said.
