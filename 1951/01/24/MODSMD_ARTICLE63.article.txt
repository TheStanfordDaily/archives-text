# Leland Stanford's Experiment Leads to Modern-Day 'Movie'
## 
### HARRY GLAZE 
Attending Sunday night movies is a Farm tradition. Yet few
students realize that the movie industry in a sense had its inception
at Stanford.
It all started because Senator Leland Stanford had a theory.
He believed that during a horse's stride, all four of the animal's

feet were off the ground at the same
time—and he proceeded to prove it.
j Senator Stanford's experiments
with photography are generally con
ceded to be the basis for present-day
i motion pictures.
The Senator had bought a fine trot-
I ting horse named Occident in July of
j 1870. Two years later he hired Ead
t ward J. Muybridge, a photographer,
to help him prove his theory by tak
ing pictures of the horse as it was
' going at full stride.
During the earlier experiments the
| "instantaneous exposure" of the
j camera was one-twelfth of a second.
L The pictures registered only as blurs;
' and the idea was dropped until five
years later, when Muybridge was
| able to get exposures at a speed of
j approximately one-thousandth of n
1 second. The movie camera of today,
however, takes exposures of one
i thrteth of a second.
Theory Proved
The success of these later pictures
; pleased the Senator greatly. Besides
j proving his theory, it gave him the
j idea of obtaining a series of pictures
showing the horse in various stages
'of the stride.
I Deeididng to carry the project

| further, Senator Stanford callcd in
[ John D. Isaacs, a mechanical engi
f neer, to devise a method to set oil the
j shutters of a large number of cam
eras in sequence; and a studio was
set up with a battery of 24.
The first method attempted for
j taking the pictures was to stretch a
series of threads across the track.
As the horse broke each thread, a
j shutter controlled by rubber bands
would open and close.
Improvements
An improvement was later made
by having the threads close electrical
I circuits. A still later device in
volved a weighted clock that would
| snap the shutters at pre-arranged in

tervals, thus eliminating the threads j
across the track.
Muyfcridgc photographed many
other animals in motion and wrote a ;
book on his "movies" in which he
preferred to forget that Senator
Stanford had originated the idea.
Meanwhile, Senator Stanford had j
assigned Dr. J. D. B. Skillman the
job of analyzing the pictures and ex
perimenting further. He also gave
the doctor two of his horses for dis- •
section to complete the research.
May 8, 1929, a ceremony was held \
at Stanford commemorating the work '
done under the auspices of Senator
Stanford. Several important motion
picture officials were present, and a i
plaque was put up in Memorial
Court. In multiple Hollywood style,
another plaque was placed in the Red
Barn, where Leland Stanford was j
probably the first "movie" director.


FIRST MOVIES- Here are the results of Senator Leland Stanford's early experiments concern
ing the movement of horses. He hired Eadward I. Muybridge, photographer," to take pictures
that would prove that all four of a trotting horse's feet were off the ground at the same time during
one stage of the stride. The whole series of 24 pictures, projected on the wall in scguence, is
credited with being the first "motion picture."
