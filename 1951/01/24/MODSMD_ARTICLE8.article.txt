## 
### 
"Folk sonys a. e a live, active. over
changing force capable of infinite
vai icty of influences, which arc a joy
to the hearer and a delight. to the
sinner."
Dr. Archibald Thompson Davison,
professor of music at Harvard Uni
versity, thus described a country's
mtive .'ones at last night's Tuesday
Evening Series.
Speaking in conjunction with the
music education week which opened
with his talk last night, Dr. Davison
quoted Cecil Sharp's essay, "Folk
Singing in School," in saying that
Ibis tvpc of song is not like art muse,
that is. the conscious work of an in
dividual. Il is rather a growth than
a composition.
Dr. Davison went on to explain
that there are two popular theories
on the development of folk songs,
The first theory is that the song. 4
originated in a community and
liould he fashioned by successive
general : ons. The other point of view
is tii;:l the son<?s were written bv in
dividuals and any change is plpyiar
isâ€¢ n. The speaker held the formct
view.
Dr. Davison pointed out that Eng
lish folk on have been influenced
in various dccres by England's man,\
invaders such as the Normans an.'i
Celts.
