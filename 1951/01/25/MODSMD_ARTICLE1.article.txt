## West Asks Russia To Talk on Peace 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (I P)
The United States, Britain, and
France have asked Russia to agree to
a meeting of the Bit; Four deputies
in Paris to map a full-dress foreign
ministers' conference on "all prob
lems likely to threaten world peace."
The moderately worded note, de
livered in Moscow yesterday and
made public here tonight, rejected
Russia's suggestion that the talks be
limited to German rearmament. The
Western powers said it would b'Â»
"inadequate and unreal" to rule out
"other causes of international ten
sion."
