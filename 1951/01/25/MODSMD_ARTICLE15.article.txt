# Police Ask Return Of Missing Signal
## 
### 
The Police Department said today
that they would like the party who
removed the stop sijjn from the
Toyon-Branner-Stcrn corner to re
turn it to the place.
At the moment there is no other
stop sign in the Corporation Yard,
and the loss of that one is causing
considerable misunderstanding to
the cars meeting at this crossing.
