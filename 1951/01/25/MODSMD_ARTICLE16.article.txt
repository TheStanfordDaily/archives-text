# ROME CONGRESS
## Excommers Longwinded But Stymied 
### 
Excom went into its second
week of lengthy discussion last
night on the question of sending
a delegate to the seven - day
Rome Peace Congress, April 2
to 9. And still there were no
conclusions reached.
At. 10:30 p.m., discussion was ta
bled ponding a special mooting
scheduled for next Monday at 4 p.m. 1
For more than one and one-half j
hours, representatives and students
from the floor considered principally I
the following questions:
1. Can Exeom allow a student to ,
use the Stanford name in attending a
conference whose purpose is to pro
vide an "impetus to the movement
for a world constitutional govern- j
ment"?
2. Are the character and aims of I
the peace congress — those of pro
moting a federal government i
throughout the world—in agreement
with student opinion?
.1. Would a Stanford delegate to
the congress he allowed the right to
vole.' Is there any precedent at
tached to sending delegates to such
away - from - school conventions as
the one in question?
4. Is there any criterion for jus
tifying an expense of a minimum
of $450 to pav a delegate's ex- j
penses? Arc there other campus
organizations which could better
use the money?
In answer to these queries, many
nf which remained unanswered, Dick
O'Connell, junior class Excom rop
; resentative and member of the com
mittee named last week to investi- j
gate the problem, said that delegates
to the congress "would work as in- j
dividuals and not as governments."
He said the main value of the
congress would be tbal of "educat
ing" the Stanford student body on
possible solutions to the problems
of world peace.
Committeeman Oil Jonas, ofT
j campus representative, said that the
1 potential of having a Stanford stu
dent attend such a meeting is "un
i limited."
Jonas outlined a six - point pro
j gram in support of the proposal to
I send a delegate. Among his points
j were those of a campus-wide elec-
I tion, a preliminary '"campaign" fea
turing the views and qualifications
of the nominees, a scries of articles
emanating from the conference and
printed in The Daily, and a program
j of "follow-up" talks in and around
i the campus once the delegate has rc
-1 turned.
Jonas asked representatives if
"the stakes were worth the gamble."
; He cited various ASSU budgetary
expenses such as those for card
; stunts, rallies, and dances, and indi
j catod that money for a peace con
gress delegate held "relative prc-
I eminence" over such items.
He also cited the present expected
I surplus of $2.(180 in the ASSU con
[ tingency fund as a source of finan
cial backing.
Speaking from the audience, stu
dent John B. Wejdler asked Excom
| to consider whether or not "Stan
ford, by sending a delegate, would
| commit its name to such principles
as world federalism . . . and limited
! sovereignty . . ."
Wcidlcr sai l the University ad
ministration hoijld first be cheeked
before further discussion of the
[ question.
Senior class representative Gordy
j Campbell, who is also a member of
the investigating group, said "there
' is no indication at all that the con

press has any connection with a
Communist front organization." He
eiterl three previous occasions when
ASSU funds were appropriated by
Excom tf> .send delegates to conven
tions of national, state, and world
character.
At least three affirmative replie:
were hoard around the conference
table when graduate member Elliott
Schricr asked if anyone "is opposed
to a conference on world federal
ism."
Ironically enough, men: ball:
representative Phil Saeta summed
up the long-winded rounds of de
bate when he spouted forth, "Thi;.
may even be THE problem of the
q uartcr!"

Excom went into its second
week of lengthy discussion last
night on the question of sending
a delegate to the seven - day
Rome Peace Congress, April 2
to 9. And still there were no
conclusions reached.
At. 10:30 p.m., discussion was ta
bled ponding a special mooting
scheduled for next Monday at 4 p.m. 1
For more than one and one-half j
hours, representatives and students
from the floor considered principally I
the following questions:
1. Can Exeom allow a student to ,
use the Stanford name in attending a
conference whose purpose is to pro
vide an "impetus to the movement
for a world constitutional govern- j
ment"?
2. Are the character and aims of I
the peace congress — those of pro
moting a federal government i
throughout the world—in agreement
with student opinion?
.1. Would a Stanford delegate to
the congress he allowed the right to
vole.' Is there any precedent at
tached to sending delegates to such
away - from - school conventions as
the one in question?
4. Is there any criterion for jus
tifying an expense of a minimum
of $450 to pav a delegate's ex- j
penses? Arc there other campus
organizations which could better
use the money?
In answer to these queries, many
nf which remained unanswered, Dick
O'Connell, junior class Excom rop
; resentative and member of the com
mittee named last week to investi- j
gate the problem, said that delegates
to the congress "would work as in- j
dividuals and not as governments."
He said the main value of the
congress would be tbal of "educat
ing" the Stanford student body on
possible solutions to the problems
of world peace.
Committeeman Oil Jonas, ofT
j campus representative, said that the
1 potential of having a Stanford stu
dent attend such a meeting is "un
i limited."
Jonas outlined a six - point pro
j gram in support of the proposal to
I send a delegate. Among his points
j were those of a campus-wide elec-
I tion, a preliminary '"campaign" fea
turing the views and qualifications
of the nominees, a scries of articles
emanating from the conference and
printed in The Daily, and a program
j of "follow-up" talks in and around
i the campus once the delegate has rc
-1 turned.
Jonas asked representatives if
"the stakes were worth the gamble."
; He cited various ASSU budgetary
expenses such as those for card
; stunts, rallies, and dances, and indi
j catod that money for a peace con
gress delegate held "relative prc-
I eminence" over such items.
He also cited the present expected
I surplus of $2.(180 in the ASSU con
[ tingency fund as a source of finan
cial backing.
Speaking from the audience, stu
dent John B. Wejdler asked Excom

ford, by sending a delegate, would

as world federalism . . . and limited
! sovereignty . . ."

Senior class representative Gordy
