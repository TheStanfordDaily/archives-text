# Dissension Dims Chances for Faculty Rating System; Educational Group Fails to Approve Single Plan
## 
### 
The chances of a faculty rating
system being approved and put
into operation by the Student-
Faculty Educational Commis
sion seem very slim, Alberta
F.ngvall, chairman of the joint
committee, said yesterday.
She said tHo group, composed of
five students and five faculty mem
ber-. hiwl di cussed the proposed
ratina system only briefly, largely
because of wide disagreement It- ;
twecn Indent and faculty view
points. "I think we would have
reaeh< d {in impasse if we'd rorttinued
to discuss it." Miss Engvall added.
Ilu' faculty will agree to an al
ternate propositi, the chairman
said, which would provide student-,
faculty conferences in specific
courses. A croup of students, for
cxrmplc. who had taken Sociology
I might hold a "hull session" with
the instiuctors — interchanging
ideas on how the students could
get more out of the course.
There would he considerable value
in this type of conference, Mis.- Kng
vall .said.
1 lie faculty rating system was pro
mised a year ago last fall and experi

mental questionnaires were used in a
♦ow classes. Students were to answei
anonymously whether the organiza
tion ot lectures t< stbooks, and tin

course as -i whole was effective:
whether (he material whs being pre
sented ton fa. I or in the right order;
whether the right type of tests and
exercises were being given; unci
whether the students were actually
assimilating tlir material.
In addition to the questions there
whs roOni for the students to add
critical comments which might help
tlie in. tructor improve the" enurse for
future students.
One of the main criticisms of the
rutins churls used a yen - ago wa«
that the questions did not fit each
course.

ult,\ latin? would he used would
he voluntary. Miss l\ngvall empha

the rating blanks and criticisms
would he the teacher giving the
course.
Dcnn of Student" Donahl Win
hijiler spoke highly of the possibili
ties of ueh a faculty rating system.
The only opposition that Dr. Win
higler could anticipate for the pro
posal would come as a result of:
1. A misunderstanding on the part
of the (acuity ot what the plan i-.
2. An old-time feeling on the part

of the profe ;,;or that he has nothing
to gain from Indent criticism and
that he is "king of his own elass
rpom."
The dean doubted if there were
many Stanford teachers in the sec
ond category.

Humanities and Sciences Depart

students experience education they
know what they nrd,"

might rate the teacher on too nur-h
i>f a one. two, three basis.
Dr. Graham DnShane, of the Biol
ogy Department and a member of
the Student - Faculty Fducational
Commission, said he would have "no
objection to such a system" if it were
kept mi a constitutive hnsis. (<n two
occasions, his department has used
short questionnaires to ascertain

which type of Ji|.ijrly materials the
students favor.

was ranked low oh (lie fpiestion

Dr. John Mothersbcad. a ssoeiato
professor of philosophy, who also has

The chances of a faculty rating
system being approved and put
into operation by the Student-
Faculty Educational Commis
sion seem very slim, Alberta

committee, said yesterday.
She said tHo group, composed of
five students and five faculty mem
ber-. hiwl di cussed the proposed
ratina system only briefly, largely
because of wide disagreement It- ;
twecn Indent and faculty view
points. "I think we would have
reaeh< d {in impasse if we'd rorttinued
to discuss it." Miss Engvall added.
Ilu' faculty will agree to an al
ternate propositi, the chairman
said, which would provide student-,
faculty conferences in specific
courses. A croup of students, for
cxrmplc. who had taken Sociology
I might hold a "hull session" with
the instiuctors — interchanging
ideas on how the students could
get more out of the course.
There would he considerable value
in this type of conference, Mis.- Kng

mental questionnaires were used in a

whether the students were actually
