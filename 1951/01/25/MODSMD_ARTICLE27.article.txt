# Faculty Rating—A Critical Aid
## 
### 
Stanford students are consumers and pur
chasers just as much as the housewife who mar
<ets at the neighborhood grocery store.
However, the housewife is buying food and
nousehold supplies, and the students are buy
.)kj education. In fact we are buying education
.it the rate of $220 per quarter —at least under
. uflalion conditions.
As a consuir.er we have the right to select
he products we want in exchange for our
noney. Whether we want a basketful of social
science courses or whether we have nothing on
our list cxcept specialized engineering courses,
iw have a right to select the "educational
goods" we want.
One of the best ways to get a fair exchange
7/ould be through the formation of a workable,
/oluntary faculty-rating system, similar to the
one suggested last year.
We had hoped the Student-Faculty Educa
tional Commission would focus its attention on
his proposal the first thing this fall and that a
rating system would be in operation by winter
quarter. However, the faculty rating system is
still in the form of an idea.
What is this idea?

Under the faculty rating system, students
would have the chance to evaluate the study
materials, the instructor's methods, and the
course as a whole. Specially prepared ques
tionnaires would be filled out anonymously by
the students, handed to the teacher, and used
as a "helpful hint" for the future.
flow can a teacher afford to miss this oppor
tunity? No course is perfect in every way. It
is a chance for a teacher to analyze his meth
ods in relation to what the students want to
learn and what they are learning.
Few faculty members have training in edu
cation courses outside of their specialized de
grees. That is, a very brilliant research man or
author of many textbooks may be teaching
classes and lecturing without the benefit of a
background in teaching procedure and meth
ods.
A system in which students could criticize
the organization of the course and the study
materials used would add to the teacher's ex
perience and ability.
And most important is the student's right to
know he is receiving the best possible educa
tion for the money.
