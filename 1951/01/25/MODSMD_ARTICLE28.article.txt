# Clubs and Fraternities Side by Side
## 
### 
Ground breaking ceremonies were held this
week for the Eating Clubs' new 5183,000 build
ing.
Besides being merely "a wonderful thing,"
construction of the new seven-club structure
represents a situation which is truly unigue
>among major universities in the nation.
Amazingly enough, Stanford University is
the only "big" university in the country that
can boast of eating clubs and fraternities —both
of them strong in their own right and both of
them living side by side.
Princeton, Harvard, and Yale have all ruled
out fraternities. As a result, eating clubs at
those schools have taken on the characteristics
of fraternities, and the vacancies left by the
less-demanding clubs has been left unfilled.
Here at Stanford, inspiration for the new Eat
ing Club building came from two prime
sources: the clubs themselves and the univer
sity's administration. For the past four and one
half years unselfish club members have spent
long hours of their time gathering together

funds, plans, and support for the biggest ven
ture they have ever undertaken.
And when Building Committee Chairman Bill
McPherson and his cohorts were ready to take
action early last year, the Board of Trustees
stood solidly behind him. Approval of a Uni
versity loan was granted to the club on March
16, to which President Sterling later flashed his
smile of "hearty approval."
We have nothing but praise for such men as
McPherson, Le Kelson, Dan Stone, Brook Tau
ser, Sarge Littlehale, Ted Norton, and their fel
low clubbers who dreamed of the new building
and will soon see that dream become a reality.
Certainly they have shown the way to some
fraternity men who are understandably worried
about possible extinction and problems of re
vivifcation "after the war."
As Men's Counselor Richard Balch puts it,
"Strong and healthy eating clubs help to make
for strong and healthy fraternities." Moreover,
as the Eating Clubs at Stanford have proven,
the reverse can be just as true.R. R.
