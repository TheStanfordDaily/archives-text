# CAMPUS OPINION
## Use the Silent Treatment 
### 
To the Editor:
J .shall not address myself to Donald E. Close. He
has already exposed himself in this column. His pre
viou comments on the Health Service are outclassed,
as an example of lack of understanding of America
or of Stanford, only by his recent sponsorship of the
Swift meeting at the Palo Alto High School audi
torium. Mr. Close, of course, may speak his mind
wherever and whenever, he choses.
The comment which I wish to make 3s directed to
The Daily, which gave as much space to the article
announcing the Swift meeting as it has given, in a
single reporting, to any of the major campus activi
ties during the year. I do not believe that this should
have been done; the activity was not Stanford -
sponsored and in no way concerned Stanford.
I understand, from the editors, that the publicity
was given to this meeting because "whatever else we
may think of Mr. Close, he is newsworthy." That is
certainly true; anyone advocating an extreme position
on any issue is "newsworthy.'" But the American press
has generally agreed, in recent years, that other cri

teria must be applied to the choice of news features.
The Daily should be aware that the modern tech
nique for dealing with those who would spread preju
dice is to ignore them, it having been found that lack
of publicity soon causes the hate organizations to fold
up for lack of audience or income. Witness the decay
of the organization sponsoring Gerald L. K. Smith's
speeches.
The same technique should be applied, on the Stan
ford campus, to Donald Close. Let him rant in private,
without publicity. And let The Daily go on with its
usually excellent coverage of constructive campus
activities.
MORTON K. BLAUSTEIN
(Editor's Note. —The Daily's coverage on Dr. Swift
was based on the fact that a very newsworthy Stan
ford student and a very active campus group, ACLU,
were involved in a controversy in direct relation to
Dr. Swift's appearance in Palo Alto. We believe in
bringing the facts out in the open and letting the
public squelch the undesirable conditions. Is this not
better than allowing potential fires to burn in some
dark corner, where they may later burst out and
burn someone?)

MORTON K. BLAUSTEIN
(Editor's Note. —The Daily's coverage on Dr. Swift
was based on the fact that a very newsworthy Stan
ford student and a very active campus group, ACLU,
were involved in a controversy in direct relation to
Dr. Swift's appearance in Palo Alto. We believe in
bringing the facts out in the open and letting the
public squelch the undesirable conditions. Is this not
better than allowing potential fires to burn in some
dark corner, where they may later burst out and
burn someone?)
