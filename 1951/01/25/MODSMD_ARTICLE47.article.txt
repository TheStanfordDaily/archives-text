# Counseling Service An Aid to Students
## 
### JANET WOHLGEMUTH 
Eehind the newly painted
door of Building 100 in Inner
Quad is one of the finest coun
seling and testing centers in.the
West.
Open to all students free of charge,
the Center tries to help the student
view himself objectively. The Cen
ter does not try to give the student
a solution to his problem; it tries to
help the student himself find the
solution.
Two main types of problems are
handled here—vocational and per
sonal. These include problems con
cerning courtship and marriage,
studies and draft, family, adjust
ment to parents, anxiety over moral
standards, inability to concentrate
on studies, and social adjustment.
, Aids Deans
. The Counseling and Testing Cen
ter is not to be confused with the
work done by the Dean of Men and
the Dean of Women. The Center is
an aid to them. If they have a stu
dent who they feel needs more time
and help than they can give, they
will send him to the Counseling and
Testing Center.
A minimum of three hours of
counseling is done with a student.
More complex problems are handled
by the Center. However, a student
may go directly to the Center; he
does not need to go to the Dean of
Men or Women first.
The student first makes an a p

pointment with one of the five coun
selors. The counselor endeavors to j
get to know the student through |
finding out about his interests, fam- j
ily, books he reads, and thinks he
does and does not like to do.
If he feels that the student needs
it, he may recommend that some
tests be taken.
These tests may include the j
Strong Vocational Interest lest, j
which compares your interests with j
those of people in certain vocations, j
Some tests are designed to measure j
reading efficiency, the speed and I
level of comprehension, and vocab- j
ulary adequacy.
Others compare the student's
■study habits with those which have
been found to give good results.
There is a scholastic aptitude test
which, according to the authors, has
been "widely used as a prediction of
academic success in college."
Vocation File
In addition to these generalized
tests, tests in specific fields are given,
j such as in art or clerical work.
After the tests have been given.
| more counseling is done with the
| student. He may want to refer to the
j Center's library, which has a file of
! vocations covering more than 540 job
fields. It also has an up-to-date file
of college catalogues.
The Cnter sponsors groups work
ing in educational skills, such as re
medial reading. There are 10 groups
of 12 students each, meeting two
I hours a week. These students work
to improve such skills as reading
