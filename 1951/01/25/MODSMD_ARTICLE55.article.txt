# 'Farm' Prof Wins Honor

### 
The first variable-pitch propeller,j
developed at Stanford in 1918 by Dr.
William F. Durand. retired Stanford
professor, is now being added to the
National Air Museum of the Smith
sonian Institution in Washington, 1
D.C.
The propeller, which was the fore
runner of the modern, highly-effi
cient aircraft propellers, is being sent
to the museum by Dr. Durand at the â– 
request of Dr. Paul E. Garber, cura
tor of fhe Smithsonian Institution.
The model will join the collection i
of significant aeronautical inventions j
in the National Air Museum. Pro
peller construction was revolution
ized when the model was built and
tested in a Stanford wind tunnel 33
years ago by Dr. Durand, now 91-
year-old dean of America's aeronau- ,
tical engineers, and the late Proles- ,
sor Everett P. Lesley.
Before its construction, propellei
blades had a permanent pitch or an- ;
gle. The Durand model was built so |
the blades could be varied in pitch
to give full power for specific flight !
demands.
This development opened the way ;
for the propeller with automatic'
pitch variation now used on all but j
jet types of military and transport
planes.
Dr. Durand, for his aeronautical
work, was awarded the first Wright
Brothers Memorial Trophy and also
the Meda'l of Merit for directing the
nation's World War II jet aircraft de
velopment program.
