# Hello, This Is Cub--Stillman'
## 
### 
Officers from Stillman House vis- j
ited Mrs. Elwood P. Cubberley on
Tuesday afternoon and presented i
her with a note from the girls in the j
house, a corsage, and Cubberley sta
tionery.
At Hilltop House reaction to the
change of name was favorable. "We
always felt that the house should be
named Cubberley," said one of the
girls, "and hoped that we'd be the
group living in the house when it
happened."
Surprise was the reaction at Still- !
man. The news was announced by j
Miss Elva Fay Brown, Chief Coun
selor for Women, at their house !
meeting Monday night.
