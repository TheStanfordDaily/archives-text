# 'DUTCH' FEHRING
## Versatile Aide Has Played, Coached in Three Sports 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Jack oi all the athletic trades and master ol all—that's W. P.
"Dutch" Fehring, Stanford's assistant football and baseball coach.
Proving that the versatile player can also make the versatile
coach, Dutch was just about Mr. Everything at Purdue where he
played football, baseball, and basketball.
As a tackle, he was twice all-Big Ten, honorary captain of that

team once, and second - team All—
American; us a basketball center he
was also All-Bin Ten; and as a base
ball catcher he was voted the team's
most valuable player in his senior
year. He didn't make the All-Big
'Ion team in baseball—there wasn't
any.
(hades, Too
Not all of his attributes, however,
were to be found on the athletic
field. Scholastic-ally he was on the

Distinguished Students' list, a mem
ber of the Blue Key scholastic fra
ternity, and won the Big Ten medal
fot "combined athletic and scholastic
prowess."
At present he holds three degrees
and is working for his doctorate,
writing a dissertation on football
scouting, a subject about which he Is
well informed since that has been
one of his many functions here at
Stanford.
After graduation in 191J4, the Chi
cago White Sox grabbed Dutch and
ho joined the team in Washington,
riding all the way with veteran Luke
Appling who gave him his first base
ball baptism.
Biggest Thrill
"My biggest baseball thrill," says
Dutch, "came in Yankee Stadium.
Called from the bull pen to go in
and catch, I was as nervous as a
rookie would be in such a spot, and

[ was twice as much so when I got up j
to bat.
"The catcher was Bill Dickey, and
i lit must have seen my shakiness. He
looked up and said, 'It'll be right
down in there, kid." And it was, but
I didn't believe him.
"Before the next pitch, he said it
again; but I still didn't believe him
I even though they were ahead 13 to :
j 2. Again it came right in, and when
he said it the third time, I was ready.
But it was a little outside, and I
swung and —missed. I'll always re- |
member that day and the great
catcher who tried to help a nervous
j kid."
Buck to Purdue
In 11)34 Fehring returned to Pur
j due as head i'rosh football and bas
! ketball coach. The next year he was
j promoted to the head line coach job, j
j and in 1937 took over the varsity
j baseball reins which he held until j
11)43 when he went into the Navy.
He was assistant football coach at
lowa Pre-fiight, working with Don
Faurot, Jim 'latum, and Bud Wil
kinson of split-T fame, and went
j from there to Oklahoma following
j the war. Nineteen forty-eight saw
j him at UCLA, and the following year
jhe came here to aid Marchie
' Schwartz in football and Everett
Dean in baseball.
While still a high school star at
Columbus. Indiana, the head bas
j ketball and baseball coach of In
diana University came over to Feh
ring's home to see about getting him
to go to Indiana.
This coach wanted the Dutchman
! so badly that he let his coat behind
j so badly that he left his coat behind
' back a secontl time to give Dutch
[ more Hqosier salesmanship. But
Dutch went on to Purdue not know
ing the persistency of that Indiana
coach, who 20 years later got his
man.
You see, that coach was—Everett
Dean.

Jack oi all the athletic trades and master ol all—that's W. P.
"Dutch" Fehring, Stanford's assistant football and baseball coach.
Proving that the versatile player can also make the versatile
coach, Dutch was just about Mr. Everything at Purdue where he
played football, baseball, and basketball.
As a tackle, he was twice all-Big Ten, honorary captain of that

team once, and second - team All—
American; us a basketball center he
was also All-Bin Ten; and as a base
ball catcher he was voted the team's
most valuable player in his senior
year. He didn't make the All-Big
'Ion team in baseball—there wasn't
any.
(hades, Too
Not all of his attributes, however,
were to be found on the athletic
field. Scholastic-ally he was on the

Distinguished Students' list, a mem
ber of the Blue Key scholastic fra
ternity, and won the Big Ten medal
fot "combined athletic and scholastic
prowess."
At present he holds three degrees
and is working for his doctorate,
writing a dissertation on football
scouting, a subject about which he Is
well informed since that has been
one of his many functions here at
Stanford.
After graduation in 191J4, the Chi
cago White Sox grabbed Dutch and
ho joined the team in Washington,
riding all the way with veteran Luke
Appling who gave him his first base
ball baptism.
