# Jayvees Nip Freshmen
## CAGE THRILLER Johnson Star Of 61 to 60 Go 
### PETE GROTHE 
Real, stark, civil war broke
out on the Pavilion floor yester
day afternoon as Stanford's
Jayvees squeaked past Stan
ford's upstart freshmen, 61 to 60.
Approximately 100 onlookers
yelled themselves hoarse as the
Braves accumulated a comfortable
lead and then hung on real tight
around the corners to pant in with
the narrow victory.
With the jayvees leading, 58 to 49
with four minutes remaining, the
yearlings started to cut down the
margin. A graceful tip-in by guard
Don Carlson, a push shot from the
edge of the key by Olie SuzdalefT,
and a free throw by forward Hal
Ellis choped the Brave margin down

| to a scant four points, 58 to 54.
1 Guard Tom DuFojJr of the Braves
I tanked a set shot to temporarily dis
| courage the Cardbabes. But they
1 came raging back again as a push
shot by Don DeLong, the .same by
Zuzdalefl', and a free shot by Tom
I Green made it 00 to 59; and pande
| monium was breaking loose among
j the frosh partisan crowd.
Forward Paul Johnson meshed
, a free shot with a minute remain -
i in«* to give the JV's a til to 5!) lead.
I hut DeLong of the vearlings did
likewise to make it (il to 00.
The frosh desperately tried for an
j other basket, but the Braves' de
fense came through when it was
needed most.
A highlight of the contest was

the sensational scoring perform
ances of several of* the players.
Johnson was superb as the front
man on the Brave fast break, and
he accounted for 2'» points. Du-
Four was also an important cog in
the victory, as he hit »or 14. mostly
on long shots.
DeLong led the l'rosh with 20 j
points, sinking six out of his first i
nine attempts. Carlson, with 17, and
Dave Epperson, with 11, were next ]
in line. Carlson was particularly ef- ;
fective with tip-ins.
It marked the lirst time in nine
games that the frosh had sue- j
cumbed; but since it was an all-
Stanl'ord affair, it won't count on
their record.

PAUL JOHNSON
—Twenty-six big ones
Real, stark, civil war broke
out on the Pavilion floor yester
day afternoon as Stanford's
Jayvees squeaked past Stan
ford's upstart freshmen, 61 to 60.
Approximately 100 onlookers
yelled themselves hoarse as the
Braves accumulated a comfortable
lead and then hung on real tight
around the corners to pant in with
the narrow victory.
With the jayvees leading, 58 to 49
with four minutes remaining, the
yearlings started to cut down the
margin. A graceful tip-in by guard
Don Carlson, a push shot from the
edge of the key by Olie SuzdalefT,
and a free throw by forward Hal
Ellis choped the Brave margin down

| to a scant four points, 58 to 54.
1 Guard Tom DuFojJr of the Braves
I tanked a set shot to temporarily dis
| courage the Cardbabes. But they
1 came raging back again as a push
shot by Don DeLong, the .same by
Zuzdalefl', and a free shot by Tom
I Green made it 00 to 59; and pande
| monium was breaking loose among
j the frosh partisan crowd.
Forward Paul Johnson meshed
, a free shot with a minute remain -
i in«* to give the JV's a til to 5!) lead.
I hut DeLong of the vearlings did
likewise to make it (il to 00.
The frosh desperately tried for an
j other basket, but the Braves' de
fense came through when it was
needed most.
A highlight of the contest was

the sensational scoring perform
ances of several of* the players.
Johnson was superb as the front
man on the Brave fast break, and
he accounted for 2'» points. Du-
Four was also an important cog in
the victory, as he hit »or 14. mostly
on long shots.
DeLong led the l'rosh with 20 j
points, sinking six out of his first i
nine attempts. Carlson, with 17, and
Dave Epperson, with 11, were next ]
in line. Carlson was particularly ef- ;
fective with tip-ins.
It marked the lirst time in nine
games that the frosh had sue- j
cumbed; but since it was an all-
Stanl'ord affair, it won't count on
their record.
