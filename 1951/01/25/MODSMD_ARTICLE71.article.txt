# Stanford Wants Game Protection
## 
### 
Stanford has applied to the State
| Fish and Game Commission to be
| reclassified as a state came refuge.
Last year the commission declared
I the 7,000-acre area "open" despite
strong protests from Stanford au
thorities.
Reasons why the area should again
j be a game refuge, which would close
j the property to hunters, will be giv
en by Stanford attorneys this week
I at a meeting of the state commission.
