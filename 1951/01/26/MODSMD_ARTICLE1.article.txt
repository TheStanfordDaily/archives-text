## Rau Hints Chinese Await Instructions 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y.. Jan. 25
â€”India threw out a strong hint in
the United Nations today that Chi
nese Communist troops in Korea
may be avoiding contact with Allied
forces on instructions to await diplo
matic negotiations.
Sir Benegal Rau, whose govern
ment maintains close contact with
Chinese Communist representatives
in New Delhi, said the lull in Korean
fighting "may not be without signifi
cance."
Rau, who is the chief helmsman of
UN efforts to bring about a cease
fire in Korea, made the statement in
the political committee of the Gen
eral Assembly.
Soviet Delegate Semyon Tsarap
kin told the committee later that
Russia favored a seven-nation con
ference to settle the Korean ques
tion, but did not agree with an
Asian - Arab proposal because it
failed to include certain points de
manded by the Chinese.
Informed sources at Lake Success
and in London said the Chinese
Communists would accept the
Asian - Arab proposal, which calls
for the seven-nation parley to nego
tiate a cease-fire as its first order of
business.
