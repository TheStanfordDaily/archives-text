## 
### EMILY McKOWN 
The world renowned London String Quartet demonstrated the
basis of their fame Wednesday night in Memorial Auditorium be
fore a well-rewarded, enthusiastic audience.
Performing with a perfection that is rare, even among better
known artists, the ensemble consistently maintained the inte-

gration. intonation, artistry, and in
terpretation that could come from
only the finest of musicians.
The Brahms Quartet Op. 51 No. 2 in
A minor opened the program a ma
ture work that is demanding of depth
I and understanding. It was played
1 with these qualities to a fine degree,
and became richer, more fully satis
' fying than when played by lesser
j groups. Hugo Wolf's Serenade fol
lowed and, while not complex, was
full of character and refreshment.
The familiar Beethoven Quartet
i Gp. 59, No. 2 in E minor closed the
program and gave the quartet the op
portunity to bring out the distinction
and beauty that Beethoven is when

in the hands of such excellent musi
cians.
• The ovation following the perform
ance was one of the most demonstra
tive and enthusiastic ever heard in
the Memorial Auditorium and to the
relief of the audienvc, the quartet re
turned for an encore with Haydn's
Serenade for solo violin with pizzi
cato accompaniment.
In response to continued cheering
and ovation the quartet announced,
'We will now have a contrast, and
you guess it!" Our guess it that it
was Anthony Collins' arrangement of
Camptown Races. And our regret is,
with the entire audience, that it was
the last encore.
