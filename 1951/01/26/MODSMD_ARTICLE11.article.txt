# Draft Edict Is Clarified
## Students Can End Year, Still Enlist 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP) —
The Defense Department and Selec
tive Service tonight put into effect a
new program which will give college
students a better chance of being as
signed to the military service of their
own choice.
Under the new policy, originally
disclosed last Friday, college students
will be able to complete their aca
demic year and still enlist in the
branch of their choice, provided
openings are available.
Defense Secretary George C. Mar
shall had said the plan would enable
college students to take pre-induc
tion physicals, receive induction or
ders, and then enlist in the service
of their choice within 90 to 30 days
before the end of the school year.
The new policy will take advantage
of a section of the law which permits
Selective Service to reopen the cases
of college students who want to
complete their academic year. This
automatically cancels their induction
order and gives them a right to en
list.
Meanwhile Assistant Defense Sec
retary Anna M. Rosenberg disclosed
today that the armed services are
lowering their mental and physical
standards to raise an extra 150,000
draftees—including many now classi
fied 4-F.
She said some of the 799,000 men
now in 4-F will be taken as "full
members" of the armed forccs, and
"we hope" to put others in limited
service jobs.
