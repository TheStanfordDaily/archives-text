# Blood Donors' Appointments Can Be Made
## At Least 250 Needed to Pledge Wednesday Plasma Contribution 
### 
Appointments for blood donations on Wednesday can be made
any time today at the booth in front of the Cellar. John Gallagher
and Joan Wilson, co-chairmen of campus recruiting, stressed that
everyone under 21 will have to hand in his permission slip before
an appointment can be made.
The Mobile Red Cross unit from San Jose will be here Wednes-

day, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and will"
set up its station at the Women's
Clubhouse. Appointments will take
about 45 minutes.
The minimum goal is set at 200
pints, and because of unexpected re
jections or missed appointments, at
least 250 donors must sign up.
Prospective donors must weigh
at least 110 pounds, be in good gen
eral health, and cannot have been a
blood donor within three months.
Students having the following con
ditions are automatically disquali
fied as donors: Active tuberculosis,
diabetes, infectious jaundice at any
time, acute colds, sulfa drugs within
two weeks of donation, organic heart
disease, tooth extraction within two

weeks of donation, bleeding tenden
cies, brucellosis, vaccination within
four weeks of donation, other immu
nizations within two weeks (rabies
accepted five years after last treat
ment), filariasis, major surgery or se
rious illness within three months,
mononucleosis, pregnancy at present
or terminating at any stage within
past nine months. Malaria, however,
does not rule a donor out.
The blood that is collected here
will be taken to San Jose in the late
afternoon, processed into plasma
and flown directly to Korea. Type
i ''O" blood is preserved vfhole and
flown in refrigerated containers to
1 battle stations.
Last December, the National Red
Cross was asked to increase its blood
donor program by 100 per cent, be
| cause of the large number of casual
ties in the Korean war. The impor
tance of plasma has been stressed
many times by American military
surgeons, who credited it with sav
ing 97 per cent of the wounded in
the last war.
