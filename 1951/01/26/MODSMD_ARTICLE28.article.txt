### BILL MATTSON 
(Editor's note.—When freshman William 11. Matt
son 111 drew a nice round goose egg on a recent
Western Civ quiz, his professor commented at the
tml of his 290-word essay, "Why don't you write
Hull Session for the Daily!"
(Student Mattson took the prof's words to heart.
The following is a reprint (word for word) of his
answer to the question, "Identify and discuss the
significance of the Thomistie synthesis in the feudal
civilization.")
Waal, it could be a religious order that changed the
order of things or more likely it is some sort of political
theory that influenced the Feudal system of civiliza
tion.
It was probably put forth by some guy with a name
.stich as Thomas. I have no idea what his last name or
family connections might be. It does not make much
difference because we're interested in what he did and
not who he was.
This Thomistie synthesis probably influenced the
Feudal Age at that time greatly. Its significance in

I
history must not be overlooked. It was probably the
most influencing influence that had risen to that time.
I know that there were several orders of monks that
had sprung up. but they were nothing as compared
to the Thomistie synthesis.
Any student of Medieval history knows about the
Thomistie synthesis and it is greatly expanded upon
in countless history books; much more than I can
ever hope to do and far beyond my poor power to
add or detract.
1 suggest that anyone interested in learning more
about the Thomistie synthesis look in any reliable his
tory of" the Feudal Ages.
P.S. It is not mentioned in King Arthur's Court and
Knights of the Roundtable, so don't look there.

NOTE!—I have tried* to follow instructions. I have
used two pages or less, discussed k through rather
disgustingly, and made an attempt at identification.
Yours truly,
