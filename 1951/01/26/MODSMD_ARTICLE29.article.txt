# THROUGH 'HOT' WARS AND A 'COLD' ONE
## Farm Presidents Caution Against "Draft Excesses" 
### 
Stanford presidents in times of great national crisis
—two hot wars and the present "cold" one—have
pledged full support in defense of the country. But,
also, they have warned against draft excesses which
would deprive the United States of the continuing How
of trained specialists.
Dr. Donald H. YVinbigler, dean of students at Stan- «
ford, noted today that current uncertainties in the
minds of many draft eligibles had pointed lip the atti
tudes of three Stanford presidents.
I)r. Wallace Sterling, president of the University
today, has pointed out that even "if every young
man should jump at the opportunity to hear arms
for his country" thus obviating the need for con
scription, "indiscriminate patriotism can be costly."
"If the nation is to attain the optimum result from
partial or total mobilization of its manpower," Dr.
Sterling has written, "the talent, skill, and energy of
this power must be applied selectively. In a recent
issue of the Alumni Review, he urged that students
should "get on with their education as far and as
rapidly as their country's needs permit."
Dean Winbigler recalled that prior to the first World
War, Stanford's then-president Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur pledged the University's support to the nation.
The Bo.ard of Trustees on April 9, 1917, said:
"Every element of Stanford—faculty, alumni, under
graduates, and trustees—is united in support of the
President of the nation in the prosecution of the war."
Hut Dr. Wilbur in his annual report of 1917 went
on to say:
"Ft w ill be more than ever desirable for the uni
versities to stand for those subjects and that type
of education which are vital to the best mental
growth and to community and national develop
ment. The intense practicality of war and its needs
must not throw our universities out of balance."
Dr. Wilbur continued in office past the outbreak of

World War II and faced a problem similar to that
facing Dr. Sterling today.
In August of 1941. Dr. Wilbur announced the Uni
versity had accepted the "responsibility of presenting
the need of trained men in modern warfare."
"Our brain pool," Dr. Wilbur said then, "must not
only be maintained but constantly replenished by a
• steady flow of trained experts."
"Every student," he continued, "with enough brains
to get into a university and work particularly in such
fields as biology, chemistry, physics, geology, meteo
rology, medicine, and so on down the line, must do
so and should not put on a uniform and go off to do
something that other people can do, and often can
do better. '
Dr. Wilbur asked for no exemptions. "We have in
sisted," he added, however, "that they be given oppor
tunity for the training that they require if they are to
do a good job, and that the nation requires if it is to
meet its very pressing and manifold responsibilities."
Stanford's fourth president—and Dr. Sterling's
predecessor — was Dr. Donald B. Tresidder who
served but five years. But those years were from
194,'1 to 1948, the perciod in which the United States
reached the zenith of its military strength and in
which, also, it experienced its historic demobilization
ami disarmament.
Late in November, 1945, Dr. Tresidder, with Presi
dent James B. Conant of Harvard and the presidents
of 32 other American colleges and universities, sup
ported a four-point statement on military service.
It suggested limiting draftee service to 15 months
with extension of the selective service act on a year
to-year basis; all-out encouragement of voluntary en
listments; the establishment of a National Defense
Commission to study the whole problem of national
defense and finally, the postponement of any decision
on Universal Military Training until the' Commission
had fully studied the subject.
