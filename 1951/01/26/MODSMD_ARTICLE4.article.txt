WASHINGTONâ€”Sweeping wage
price orders bringing most of the
nation's economy under government
control won final approval today and
were set for issuance tomorrow.
The cabinet-level Defense Mobili
zation Board headed by Charles E.
Wilson approved the broad terms of
the orders prepared by Price Con
troller Michael V. DiSalle and Wage
Stabilizer Cyrus S. Ching.
DiSalle's order, described as "all
ready to go," is expected to roll back
nearly all prices to Jan. 2 levels. The
wage formula will be more flexible,
aiming generally at pegging the
wage scale 10 per cent higher than
January, 1950.
