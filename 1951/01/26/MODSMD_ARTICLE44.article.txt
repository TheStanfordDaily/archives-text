# Revolt Tension Is Detected in Saigon
## 
### DAVID WONG 
The noonday sun was blazing out of an azure sky as the 12,000-
ton Champollion wormed its way up the muddy waters of Saigon
River. On board I was singing "Aupres de ma Blonde" with a
group of French soldiers.
As the ship sailed slowly along the sixty miles of river which

led to Saigon, our song was occa- j
sionally interrupted by the staccato ,
sound of gunfire coming from the
wild greenlands which fianked the !
river. That was early in 1947.
Upon arrival in Saigon, I found it
to be a compact little town which i
looked like a bit of France trans
planted to Oriental soil. I was struck
by its neat, modern shops, its wide, |
tree-lined boulevards, and above all,
by its beautiful Annamite women.
An occasional soldier walking by
with a girl on one arm and a sub
machine gun in the other was a re

minder that a revolution was taking
place out in the jungles and the
paddy-fields.
With the end of the World War, the
native population of Indo-China had
expected to receive independence
along with Burma, Indonesia, and
the Philippines. When that failed
to materialize, the people rallied
around Communist leader Ho Chi
Minh and thv fighting began in
deadly earnest.
Not Communistic
It would be a mistake, however, to
label the revolution as being wholly
or even mainly Communistic. It was
nationalistic more than anything
else. A great majority of the people
were genuinely interested in seeing
the French Indo-China.
In the fighting that followed, the
rebels gained control of the country
side while the French held the cities
and towns. But even in the urban
areas, Vietminh bombs and grenades
exploded with great frequency. The
unfortunate part was that innocent
women and children were often
among the dead.
Weak Leadership
Later, the French set up a native
government under the former Em
peror Bao Dai. Though that govern
ment received the "recognition of
Britain and the United States, it
drew little support from the people.
Bao Dai lacked the ability and the
wisdom to lead his people through
the difficult transitional period from
colonial status to independence.
The French and Vietnam forces
have met with some military suc
cesses recently, but their position is
still a precarious one. Ironically, it
was a famous Frenchman who once
said that if a people were really dis
satisfied with a ruler, then no force
of arms could maintain that rule.
