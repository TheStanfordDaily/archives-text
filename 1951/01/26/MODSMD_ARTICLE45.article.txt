# British Films Play at Park
## 
### ROY HEMMING AND GEORGE BUCKLEY 
British accents prevail this week
on the screen of the Park Theater
in Menlo in the form of a costume
melodrama and a romantic comedy
— both with stars who are fairly
well known in American movies too.
."Madeleine," featuring England's
leading contender in the Stone Face
Derby—Ann Todd—is a slow but in
teresting film about a wench who
breaks the strict codes of her Vic
torian family environment by ac
cepting a secret lover. He comes to

see her only at
night after the
family has gone
to bed—and be
ing British, the
family goes to
bed conveniently
early.

Then the lover suddenly dies of
arsenic poisoning, and the girl is
blamed. The rest of the picture tries
to present the case for both the pros
ecution and the defense—with the
novel twist of making you (the au
dience) become the jury.
The atmosphere of the Victorian
age, with its hard and fast mores, its
lack of human warmth, and its basic
hypocrisies, has been very effective
ly captured by director David Lean
(who made "Great Expectations").
And the way he integrates camera
motion with William Alwyn's music
score deserves some kind of a special
award.
The second feature, '"Aclam and
Evalyn," is a lightweight, meander
ing comedy about a gambler who
must decide between his game and a
pretty girl. Jean Simmons and Stew
art Granger manage to inject con
siderable charm into some familiar
situations.
