Its" Cotxl to Have a Centleman Basketball Coach
Thank the good Lord that we have a gentleman for a basketball coach.
Coach Everett Dean, besides being an expert technician in the sport of
bounce, is the epitome of composure and dignity at games. As well he
should be. We never realized how commendable these traits were until we
.saw three other local coaches in action â€”Tom DeNike of Galileo High
School, Bob Feerick of Santa Clara, and Red Foley of St. Mary's, to be
specific.
These coaches generally create more disturbance than one finds at a
Donald E. Close get-together.
It"s Stupid to Tell a Player He's Stupid
For example, take DeNike of Galileo: DeNike is a short, squat man who
has a habit of bellowing when his team is losing. Which was 95) per cent of
the time when Galileo met our frosh last week.
At one juncture DeNike beckoned a pudgy finger at one of his floundering
playefs and intoned these tender sentiments into his ear: "Now, listen,!
, dammit, all 1 want you to do is to stand in that right corner and
don't move out of that territory, even if the ball comes to you. Even you
should be able to grasp that. I hope it's simple enough for you. 1 '
Granted that DeNike's underling didn't appear the Phi Bete type, still 1
the* coach didn't have to tell him in so many words that he was a complete
idiot. Wee fail to see how such tactics can incite confidence in a player.
Feerick of Santa Clara Kicks Benches
Feerick of Santa Clara is another basketball tutor who should be taken
aside by Emily Post. Poor old Bob just can't control himself. At the Santa
Clara-Colorado game, he was swearing at his players, bawling out the refs, 1
jumping up on the floor, and generally acting like a high schooler on his
first drunk.
When a Bronco guard failed to watch a Colorado forward, the blood
rushed to Feerick's fate, he jumped up, and kicked over the bench he
was sitting on. Two bug-eyed Santa Clara substitutes found themselves
sitting on their imagination as their support was rudely thrust from
beneath them.
The lii ligest ( loan Is Foley of St. Maty's
Tlie biggest riot of them all is Coach Red Foley, St. Mary's red-thatched,
tomato-faced clown. The slightest failing, such as a narrowly-missed free
shot, will send him into a virtual convulsion, with three attendants rushing
to his side, lest he suffer a heart attack. Sometimes the hot-tempered Foley
will get so ired that he refuses to talk to his team.
It's easy to win gracefully, but the real sport knows how to lose grace
fully. That's another Foley shortcoming. When a coach loses the game, it's
the custom to congratulate the winning mentor. This Foley did in the San
Jose State game, but he grimaced, turned his head the other way, and shook
hands. As il he were shooting a prize race horse that had just broken its leg.

"Whatta Runner Said Cas
At the frosh football banquet at Dinah's the other night, frosh backfield
coach Rock Campbell got off a goodie about line coach Jim Castagnoli.
In 1948, Stanford generally played a seven-man line with Castagnoli as
linebacker behind the center. One Saturday, however, Marchie ordered a
shift to a five-man line with Cas playing linebacker on the left side. The
All-Coast center's special instructions were to watch the halfback on a
swing play to the left. To make a long story short, the play developed, and
the halfback scooted for a touchdown.
Cas was immediately jerked from the game, and Marchie asked,
"What's the matter? Didn't 1 tell you to watch the halfback on the
swing around end?"
Cas answered. "I did watch him. Coach. lie sum can run like hell, '
can't he?"
