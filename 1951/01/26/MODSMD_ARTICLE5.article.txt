homes in the belief they were being
bombed.
The University of California re

ning at 1:00.21 p.m., with the center
of the disturbance about 12 miles

Leandro area.
Official telephone switchboards in
Oakland, San Leandro, and Castro

12-mile radius of Berkeley, were
flooded with calls from anxious citi
zens.
