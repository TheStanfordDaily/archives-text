### 
HONG KONG, Jan. 25 (UP) —Basketball "fixing" has gone global, the
Chinese complained today, and the way a touring team of Russians has de
veloped the technique it makes the"tin horns" at Madison Square Garden
look like rank amateurs.
The Russians, they say, not only brought in their own referees, but had

their own set of rules, introduced a |
heavier ball, and a new type back- i
board.
That made it pretty tough on the !
: home clubs who suffered a terrific
j "loss of face," the Chinese official
news agency reported today. It tried
to explain that the Russians invari
ably were the winners because of
| these advantages and also because
they were taller, faster, and had bet
i ter team work.
But what was the unkindest cut of !
i all came when after rolling up the j
kind of scores Kentucky would j
against Grassy Gulch High School,
the Russians told the Chinese how
the game should be played.
The Chinese always have played
under American rules, which gen- '
' erally are accepted throughout the [
world. However, the Russians intro- i
duced what they called "Interna- '
tional Rules. The Soviet regulations |
included the heavier ball and new j
backbpard. The Chinese accepted the
backboard and balked at the heavier '
ball, but the Russian officials made
up for the difference.
The games originally were ar- !
ranged so the Chinese could learn j
from their "Soviet brothers." The;
Chinese cited as an example of the
Russian referees' decisions an in
stance where one of the Chinese
players sprained his ankle. The ref
eree made him stay in the game to
show that "it was not the Russians'
fault."
