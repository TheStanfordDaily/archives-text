# It's Spring in January for The Baseballers As 44 Work Out
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Spring in January is the theme for
44 varsity baseballers now working |
out at the Sunken Diamond in order .
to get an early jump on the weather ;
and their defense of the CIBA cham
pionship. %
With head mentor Everett Dean j
still at the basketball controls, the j
warm-up sessions are being handled l
by Coach Dutch 'Fehring and Stu- 1
dent Coach Bob Larson, who played
outfield for last season's pennant
winners.
Biggest vacancies to lie filled are i
those left by the "Big Three" of
J the batting order — Dave Melton,
Bud Klein, and Charlie Cole—and
two first-line pitchers—Dave Stott
and Jack Heincn.
Possession is nine-tenths of the
'law, anil the law (school) possesses
nine-tenths of outfielder Jim Tra
j bucco's time, and so far he has de
cided against coming out this year,
i Unless Jim changes his mnid, it
' means that Coach Dean will have to
find replacements for all five of his
starting outfielders of last year —
I Klein, Cole, Larson, Trabuceo, and
i John "Boards" Claypool, winner of
! last season's final Cal game.
In order to strengthen this weak
: ness, hard-hitting Dick Clegg will be
! switched to the outer gardens from

his first-base spot, which he never
liked anyway. Lefty Hal Skillman,
Dave Rosenkrantz, Gene Shirley, A 1
i Stellar, Jim Agar, Chuck Essegian,
; and Harry Hugasian are the other
top candidates.
Skillman, Rosenkrantz, and Hu
j gasian had some varsity exeprience
last year, while Shirley, Agar, and
) Stellar are up from the frosh. Esse
-1 yian, varsity fullback, is a Menlo JC
! transfer.
The inliold ftets a complete turn
over with the mighty muscleman,
I Bruce Cameron, moving from
third to short, Tom Shaw shifting
, to third, and Art Ahrahamson tak
ing up Shaw's vacancy at second.
Backing up this trio are Dick Cole
(Charlie's brother) and Jim Har
ding, from Bobby Burnetts fresh-
J man team.
At first it's court ace Jim Walsh in
the lead, backed up by Hal Hennacy
and Jim Castagnoli. Hennacy, a
port - sider, is one of the fanciest
glove men seen here since Don Me-
Comber in 1947. Because of an arm
injury Castagnoli is experimenting
: at first instead of catching, but his
real value will probably lie in his
1 juinch-hitting abiLijy, at which he
j had no peer last year.
Lettermen Dick Corzine and Bill
| Herron return to the tools of igno

ranee—the catcher's glove and mask,
and Ed Miles of the frosh it in re
serve.
Iron man Joe Chez leads the pitch
ing staff of Tony Stellar, Roger
Osenhaugh, Jim Claypool. Lloyd
I Westphal, Jack Alexander, Kon
Boyer, Bob Murphy, George Goto,
] and Jim Powell.
Stellar. Murphy, and Of;enbaugh
are curve-bailers who need only to
control themselves and their pitches
| to be big winners. Claypool, a two
l year veteran, should he a good re
| lief man along with some of the other
hurling prospects.
That leaves the man without a
position, last year's frosli captain
| and battling phenom Jack Shep
! hard. A catcher by trade, Jii/.k
finds the position overcrowded,
' and coach Dean is busy looking
for other possibilities.
