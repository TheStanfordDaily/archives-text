# Dr. Houck Urges Protective Shots Against Typhoid
## Women Are Primary Target; Shots Free and Voluntary 
### 
Voluntary tetanus and typhoid immunization will be extended
to the whole campus next month, Dr. George Houck, head of the
Stanford Health Service, announced yesterday.
Stanford women are the primary target of the campaign, which
was formulated by Dr. Houck and the Student Health Committee.

Men who are not going into the"
armed services within the next eight
months are also asked to take the
series of shots. Houck told men who
are going into the service "not to
bother," as the Army will immunize
them again after their induction.
Immunization, which is highly I
rccommcnded by California Civil
Defense authorities as a precau
tionary measure, will begin Feb.
14, 15, and 16 and continue every
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
afternoon until the end of spring
quarter. The shots are free.
The three tetanus shots should be
taken at intervals of three weeks,
although as much as six weeks can
occur between shots. The series of
typhoid shots will take 15 days—
each shot taken one week after the
preceding shot.
Houck said that "not more than

five students in a thousand should
be sick enough from the effect of the
shots to stay in bed."
Joan Isham, chairman of the Stu
dent Health Committee, said that
booster shot:? will be given to veter
ans and students who traveled to
Europe last year and took the series
then.
The program is being delayed
until Feb. 14 bccause of the high
number of respiratory infections
on the campus now. Houck said,
however, that "colds" reached
their peak Tuesday and have been
declining the last two days.
Houck said that In normal times
there is little danger of typhoid at
Stanford. However, in case of war
damage to water supplies, typhoid
would cause many deaths. He said
that tetanus is dangerous now, as the
bacterium, which is carried in the
intestines of animals, can get into
any cut.
At the present time all Stanford
basketball players are required to
have tetanus shots because of the
manure-laden straw of the Cow Pal
ace. During a war, civilian iniurics
and the dangers of tetanus would in
crease.
The Health Scrvlcc: director
urged students to begin the scries
in February because active immu
nity from tetanus is not reliable
until five months after the series
has been completed. Active im
munity from typhoid occurs a few
weeks after the series.

Europe last year and took the series
then.
The program is being delayed
until Feb. 14 bccause of the high
number of respiratory infections
on the campus now. Houck said,
however, that "colds" reached
their peak Tuesday and have been
declining the last two days.
Houck said that In normal times
there is little danger of typhoid at
Stanford. However, in case of war
damage to water supplies, typhoid
would cause many deaths. He said
that tetanus is dangerous now, as the
bacterium, which is carried in the
intestines of animals, can get into
any cut.
At the present time all Stanford
basketball players are required to
have tetanus shots because of the
manure-laden straw of the Cow Pal
ace. During a war, civilian iniurics
and the dangers of tetanus would in
crease.
The Health Scrvlcc: director
urged students to begin the scries
in February because active immu
nity from tetanus is not reliable
until five months after the series
has been completed. Active im
munity from typhoid occurs a few
weeks after the series.

Voluntary tetanus and typhoid immunization will be extended
to the whole campus next month, Dr. George Houck, head of the
Stanford Health Service, announced yesterday.
Stanford women are the primary target of the campaign, which
was formulated by Dr. Houck and the Student Health Committee.

Men who are not going into the"
armed services within the next eight
months are also asked to take the
series of shots. Houck told men who
are going into the service "not to
bother," as the Army will immunize
them again after their induction.
Immunization, which is highly I
rccommcnded by California Civil
Defense authorities as a precau
tionary measure, will begin Feb.
14, 15, and 16 and continue every
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
afternoon until the end of spring
quarter. The shots are free.
The three tetanus shots should be
taken at intervals of three weeks,
although as much as six weeks can
occur between shots. The series of
typhoid shots will take 15 days—
each shot taken one week after the
preceding shot.
Houck said that "not more than

five students in a thousand should
be sick enough from the effect of the
shots to stay in bed."
Joan Isham, chairman of the Stu
dent Health Committee, said that
booster shot:? will be given to veter
ans and students who traveled to
Europe last year and took the series
then.
