# It Used to Be 'The Grippe'
## 
### 
The expected early-winter-quar
ter peak of respiratory infections hit,
the campus just two weeks later this
year than previous years, according
to Dr. George Houck, director of the
Health Service.
Rest homes last weekend and this
week have been full, with some
cases overflowing to Paly hospital.
Dr. Houck stated that the hospital
f-ases were not really severe enough
to be confined to the hospital, but
they were sent there when the rest
homes filled to capacity.
The "colds," which were on the
downgrade at the end of the week,
were what Dr. Houck called pharyn
gitis. ("Grandma, bless her soul,
called it the grippe!" he added.)
Symptoms reported were sore
throat, slight fever, and malaise.
