# Draft Order Given Final Clarification
## 
### 
A final clarification of the
draft ruling allowing students to
volunteer for a service of their
choice was released Friday by
the Defense Department and the
Office of Selective Service.
The revised ruling now provides
for the following program.
A student who receives his induc
tion notice may be deferred for the
rest of the school year. This has al
ways been the rule.
However, during the last month
of the school year, the student's
classification may be reopened by
his draft board. During this final
month the student may volunteer
for a service of his choice.
Thus, a student may pass his physi
cal exam, receive his induction pa
pers and get his deferment, generally
a 1-A-P classification under these
circumstances. But under the new
ruling, the same student may have
his case reopened during the last
month of the school year and then
enlist in a service of his choice.
The Defense Department stressed
that each service would accept en
listment only to the extent that places
were open for those who desired to
enlist.
Under the original plan an
nounced Jan. 19, student enlist
ments would have been accepted
only in the two months prior to the
final month of the academic year.
The original plan also said no stu
dents who had received their in
duction notices would be allowed to
volunteer.
Chief Counselor for Men Richard
Balch said that he hoped the clari
fications announced Friday would be
the final changes made in the ruling.
The changes were made to eliminate
conflicts with the Selective Service
law, and smooth out different inter
pretations of the ruling held by the
Defense Department and Selective
Service officials.
