# TUESDAY EVENING SERIES
## Farm Classics Professor To Give Talk on Greece 
### 
A report on Greece by a Stanford professor who recently re
turned from a 15-month stay in the Balkan country —recognized as
one of the world's trouble spots —will be presented by Dr. Hazel
D. Hansen, professor of classics, at the regular Tuesday Evening
Series lecture at 7:30 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.

Dr. Hansen's address will be a con
tinuing report on affairs in Greece.
The expert on Greek archaeology and
honorary citizen of that country gave
a series lecture on "The Greek Di
lemma" in May, 1948, after returning
from a six months' stay in that coun
try.
The Stanford professor spent 15
more months in Greece during 1949-
50 and her talk tomorrow night will
cover what has happened in the
country in the way of reconstruction
and political development since her
1947 visit.
Dr. Hansen spent much of her last
stay at the American School of Clas
sical Studies in Athens and on the
Island of Skyros. She also toured
other parts of the country, observing
economic and political conditions and

sitting in on parliamentary sessions.
She will be introduced tomorrow
evening by Prof. Herbert Dougall of
the Graduate School of Business,
chairman of the Committee on Public
Exercises.
Dr. Hansen will appear on KRON,
the Chronicle's television station, on
"Exclusively Yours," from 4 to 5 p.m.
today. She will be interviewed on
the same subject as her Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture.
