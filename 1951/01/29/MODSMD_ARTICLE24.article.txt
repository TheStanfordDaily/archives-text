! that Uncle Don had a hard time see
! ing them through his mask which
| kept slipping. They didn't mind the

; the long tail of the six-foot animal,
j .spinning him around and around.
The children, who are all recuper
ating from operations and serious
| illness, were not at all shy with the
j hopping kangaroo. They willingly

| told him their names and addresses,
wihle he pretended to be very dis
appointed that no one knew where

One boy, suffering from rheumatic
j heart disease, turned to a playmate
| and said, "He's even better than
| Easter."
