# 'Budget Criteria' and the Rome Congress
## 
### 
Excom's current word battle over the pro
posal to send a delegate to the Rome peace
congress brings up the oft-forgotten question
of criteria by which student officials budget
money to ASSU-sponsored projects.
As we see it, Excom's decision of whether or
lot to subsidize such a delegate hinges almost
entirely on the"budget criteria" question. Is
.he Rome congress what the students want for
.heir money—or would they rather finance ac
tivities that result in what some have called
'more concrete ends?"
In the final analysis, the Rome decision is
one that Excom, as executor of a "student trust
:und" must make for the good of all of us.
If the group is to be guided by "noble" sen
timents—sentiments which are not necessarily
'hose of 7,400 Farm students — then we feel
t would be abrogating its true representative
function.
But what DO the students want? Certainly
they cannot expect "concrete" results from one
delegate sent to a congress of over 500 people
from 35 nations to discuss such a baffling prob
lem as world peace. \
Even those v/ho are pushing the Rome pro
posal do not foresee the showering of "any
thing material" on Stanford students as a re
sult of a delegate. As off-campus representa
tive Gil Jonas put it last Wednesday, "The gain
would be by way of individual satisfaction . . .
and the knowledge that we are contributing
our share to the formulation of world peace."
Certainly a noble end—and one that we do

not deny. But the question remains: Do the stu
dents want to translate what they MAY feel
about a Rome peace congress into a grant of at
least $450.
As former student manager John L. Cobbs
said in his annual report of 1940, "It is clear
that the only fair allocation of these general
(student) funds is that one which provides the
maximum benefit for all students."
Nevertheless, the ex-student manager went
on to say that it is necessary to "grant eligi
bility" to various intangibles such as "credit
to Stanford's reputation" when considering
"budget criteria."
Let's face it: the Rome question is loaded
with "intangibles." As we see it, the issue is
so "intangible" and so far from being clear-cut
that the student body as a whole will have to
come to Excom's rescue before a decision is
made.
Today at 4 p.m. Excom and all interested
students will meet in the Nitery to discuss the
question. If possible, why dont' YOU make it
a point to be there?
Following today's special session and at
Wednesday's regular Excom meeting, we'd
like to see the formulation of a real program of
pan-student forums, discussions, and debates
on the Rome proposal.
If our representatives are really interested in
this thing —as they seem to be —let them start
the ball rolling and find out how the students
feel. After all, you and I are the best "budget
criteria" at Stanford.—R. R.

our share to the formulation of world peace."
Certainly a noble end—and one that we do

not deny. But the question remains: Do the stu
dents want to translate what they MAY feel
about a Rome peace congress into a grant of at
least $450.
As former student manager John L. Cobbs
said in his annual report of 1940, "It is clear
that the only fair allocation of these general
(student) funds is that one which provides the
maximum benefit for all students."
Nevertheless, the ex-student manager went
on to say that it is necessary to "grant eligi
bility" to various intangibles such as "credit
to Stanford's reputation" when considering
"budget criteria."
Let's face it: the Rome question is loaded
with "intangibles." As we see it, the issue is
so "intangible" and so far from being clear-cut
that the student body as a whole will have to
come to Excom's rescue before a decision is
made.
Today at 4 p.m. Excom and all interested
students will meet in the Nitery to discuss the
question. If possible, why dont' YOU make it
a point to be there?
Following today's special session and at
Wednesday's regular Excom meeting, we'd
like to see the formulation of a real program of
pan-student forums, discussions, and debates
on the Rome proposal.
If our representatives are really interested in
this thing —as they seem to be —let them start
the ball rolling and find out how the students
feel. After all, you and I are the best "budget
criteria" at Stanford.—R. R.
Excom's current word battle over the pro
posal to send a delegate to the Rome peace
congress brings up the oft-forgotten question
of criteria by which student officials budget
money to ASSU-sponsored projects.
As we see it, Excom's decision of whether or
lot to subsidize such a delegate hinges almost
entirely on the"budget criteria" question. Is
.he Rome congress what the students want for
.heir money—or would they rather finance ac
tivities that result in what some have called
'more concrete ends?"
In the final analysis, the Rome decision is
one that Excom, as executor of a "student trust
:und" must make for the good of all of us.
If the group is to be guided by "noble" sen
timents—sentiments which are not necessarily
'hose of 7,400 Farm students — then we feel
t would be abrogating its true representative
function.
But what DO the students want? Certainly
they cannot expect "concrete" results from one
delegate sent to a congress of over 500 people
from 35 nations to discuss such a baffling prob
lem as world peace. \
Even those v/ho are pushing the Rome pro
posal do not foresee the showering of "any
thing material" on Stanford students as a re
sult of a delegate. As off-campus representa
tive Gil Jonas put it last Wednesday, "The gain
would be by way of individual satisfaction . . .
and the knowledge that we are contributing
our share to the formulation of world peace."
