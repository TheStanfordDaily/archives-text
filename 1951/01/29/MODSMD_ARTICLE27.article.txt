### BILL MATTSON 
I see where a new t'ad has hit the campus. Ski racks.
Everybody's riding around with ski racks. You're just
not with it around here any more without a ski rack.
Time was when you had to have a ukelele in your
hip pocket the get along' in collegiate circles. I thought

lhat was bad. Now I find you're a
square il' you don't have 40 or 50
pounds of scrap metal sitting on
t<>!p of your car at all times.
iWhat you're supposed to do if
you can't afford a car, I don't
kiiow. If being in the swing of
things means what it should to
you, I suppose you could carry the
whole thing around on your back.

If might eventually mean curvature of the spine, but
the social prestige would be incalculable. Further
more, you'd be invaluable at cocktail parties as a con
versation piece. Of course, there's always the danger
that some freshman might mistake you for Rocket
Man, in which case you'd have the whole freshman
class on your back.
liut the fact remains that one must have his ski
ruck, or'biie just doesn't exist, socially speaking. The
implications of not having a ski rack are obvious,
of course".
In the first place, it means that you are not ready
to leave immediately for the "slopes." This may
seem absurd—after all. where else could one wish to
be than the "slopes"—hut. the suspicion is always
there.

In connection with this, it's important that one never
drives about with his ski rack loaded with skis. This
would defeat the whole psychology of ski racks. The
empty ski rack gives the necessary "casual sports
man" impression. Furthermore, people are more care
ful in their dealings with you. They realize that you
are ready to leave for the "slopes" at a moment's
notice, and that one cross word and you may load
your ski rack and zoom away.
Of course, the most damning implication of being
without a ski rack is that you do not enjoy skiing.
Don't get excited. I know you do. But some people
are just malicious.
After all, who could help enjoying' a sport that in
volves going broke, breaking your neck, and flunk
ing out? Who hut a fool would not enjoy getting up
at 4 in the morning and driving 200 miles along icy
mountain roads in sub-zero temperatures to slide
down a hill?
Who could be insensible to the joy of spending an
afternoon digging oneself out of a glacier, and then,
bruised and wet and frozen, driving for hours and
hours through the cold night back to campus? All
for as little as $27.50 a day!
No, my friends, you love it as I do, I know. That is
why I am so anxious that you should not suffer from
the shame of not having a ski rack. And just think! I
happen to have a beautiful ski rack that you can buy
right now for the paltry sum of $10 (ten stones). Don't
ask me why I'm selling. I told you. I love skiing.

In the first place, it means that you are not ready
to leave immediately for the "slopes." This may
seem absurd—after all. where else could one wish to
be than the "slopes"—hut. the suspicion is always
there.

In connection with this, it's important that one never
drives about with his ski rack loaded with skis. This
would defeat the whole psychology of ski racks. The
empty ski rack gives the necessary "casual sports
man" impression. Furthermore, people are more care
ful in their dealings with you. They realize that you
are ready to leave for the "slopes" at a moment's
notice, and that one cross word and you may load
your ski rack and zoom away.
Of course, the most damning implication of being
without a ski rack is that you do not enjoy skiing.
Don't get excited. I know you do. But some people
are just malicious.
After all, who could help enjoying' a sport that in
volves going broke, breaking your neck, and flunk
ing out? Who hut a fool would not enjoy getting up
at 4 in the morning and driving 200 miles along icy
mountain roads in sub-zero temperatures to slide
down a hill?
Who could be insensible to the joy of spending an
afternoon digging oneself out of a glacier, and then,
bruised and wet and frozen, driving for hours and
hours through the cold night back to campus? All
for as little as $27.50 a day!
No, my friends, you love it as I do, I know. That is
why I am so anxious that you should not suffer from
the shame of not having a ski rack. And just think! I
happen to have a beautiful ski rack that you can buy
right now for the paltry sum of $10 (ten stones). Don't
ask me why I'm selling. I told you. I love skiing.

I see where a new t'ad has hit the campus. Ski racks.
Everybody's riding around with ski racks. You're just
not with it around here any more without a ski rack.
Time was when you had to have a ukelele in your
hip pocket the get along' in collegiate circles. I thought

lhat was bad. Now I find you're a
square il' you don't have 40 or 50
pounds of scrap metal sitting on
t<>!p of your car at all times.
iWhat you're supposed to do if
you can't afford a car, I don't
kiiow. If being in the swing of
things means what it should to
you, I suppose you could carry the
whole thing around on your back.

If might eventually mean curvature of the spine, but
the social prestige would be incalculable. Further
more, you'd be invaluable at cocktail parties as a con
versation piece. Of course, there's always the danger
that some freshman might mistake you for Rocket
Man, in which case you'd have the whole freshman
class on your back.

ruck, or'biie just doesn't exist, socially speaking. The
