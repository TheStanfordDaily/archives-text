w . . . Not a Peace Congress'

(Editor's Note.—The following is an open letter to
Ex corn l»y Stanford student Bill Jarvis, taking issue
with the Rome Congress proposal. The letter will be
presented before excom by ASSU President Ted
Buttner.)
Before Excom sends a delegate to the Rome "Peace
Congress," it should make certain that the students of
Stanford know what the congress is all about. Too
often such affairs have concealed hidden allegiances
and have provided opportunities for the exploitation
of innocent people.
First of all, it is not a peace congress, and does not
portend to be such; it is a "World Federation" congress
which was called to complete the job of rubber-stamp
ing a world constitution, the substance of which was
agreed upon at the Paris Conference of last June.
The Congress is supposedly representative of the
people of the world rather than their governments.
Therefore, a Stanford delegate should be sent only in
accordance with a student referendum which should
consist of two parts:
1. Do you desire that Stanford participate in a
World Federation movement?
2. Which delegate do you vote for?
It may be significant to point out, in connection with
the first proposal, that EVERYBODY is not auto
matically in favor of just any World Federation. In
fact, when most Americans discover what a World

Federation would really mean, they all of a sudden
lose interest. Instead of going through another League
of Nations debacle, perhaps we had better face the
awful truth ahead of time. Otherwise, participating in
the conference would be a form of escapism; either we
face the realities of the world or we don't play games
at a Rome Congress for World Federation.
For example, the prepared draft of the World Con
stitution is largely the result of Robert M. Hutchins'
"Chicago Plan," which provides for one representa
tive for each one million population. With our seven
per cent of the world population, we couldn't run the
new World Federation as we now run the United Na
tions. Considering the fact that one major rebuff to
the United States from the UN might actually alien
ate our whole participation in that organization, how
long would we be content with our new seven per
cent voice in the new World Federation?
Let's face it: the rulers of the World Federation
would l»e men like Pandit Nehru and Mao Tse-tung;
they represent the populace centers of the world.
This is to say nothing of J. M. Stalin, for the Congress
is naively ignoring the Russian problem. Let us not
get mixed up in this madness of escapism; we will
never gain anything except a loss of prestige.
The best thing for the United States to do is to recog
nize that we are now in a position to offer leadership
to the free world. Let us first give careful thought to
giving constructive leadership rather than abandoning
our prerogative to an illusory World Federation.
