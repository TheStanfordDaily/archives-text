# UNDER ASSU SPONSORSHIP IN '47
## Law Students Tour Europe 
### 
Two Stanford students visited En- I
rope during the summer of 1947 un
der the sponsorship and financial
barking of the ASSU, though their
purposes differed from the proposed i
Stanford delegate to the Home peace
congress.
The two Law School students, !
Lawrence Grunnis and Bill Farrer,
toured five European countries j
through a program organized by
the International Survey Commit*
tee, a subcommittee of the lift.
Conducting interviews and discus- !
sion.s on a student-to-student level,
their object was to discover and re- 1
port to the student body on European
.Indent life and academic, socii.l, and

political trends in England, Franco.
Holland, Belgium, and Spain.
The two were chosen from 850 ap
plicants by a board of University of
ficials that included the ASSU presi
dent and vice-president. Grannis and
Farrer were selected for "excep
tional undergraduate records in aca
demic and student activities fields."
Their student body report con
sisted of a week-long series in the
Daily, student assemblies and for
ums. and a detailed written report.
They tried to present a picture of
"the thoughts, the sympathies, the
wants, and the trends" of a post
war Europe that faced many of the
problems that today are still un

solved, and that the Rome Confer
ence will consider.
Paralleling the purpose on which
Excom is considering the Rome dele- :
gation proposal, the main value of the
1947 trip was educating students on I
possible solutions to the problems oi 1
world peace, according to Excom
members then in office.
Donald B. Tresidder, then Uni
versity president, said on the stu
dents' arrival at Stanford in the
fall of 1947:
"... I hope that the reports . . . j
will stimulate earnest thought on the
part of each of us to help clarify our â€¢
thinking on the problems of ti/day."
