### 
Because of her "great political sta- ]
bility," Uruguay has been able to |
concentrate on development without S
war and bloodshed, and is now the !
most politically and economically ad- i
vanced country in South America,
Stanford professor Dr. Karl Brandt
told a Little Theater audience last
Thursday night.
Professor of Agricultural Eco
nomics in the Food Research Depart
ment. Dr. Brandt has just returned
from several months in Uruguay with
a 10-man mission sponsored jointly

] by the International Bank for Recon-
I struction and Development and the
; UN.
His lecture was one of Stanford's
I Hispanic Series talks, organized by
I Professor Ronald Hilton of the Ro-
I manic Languages Department.
Describing Uruguay as primarily
an agricultural country, Dr. Brandt
named cattle and sheep-raising as the
! chief income producers.
He said the United States has done
an increased amount of trading with
Uruguay ever since Great Britain
1 closed her markets there.
