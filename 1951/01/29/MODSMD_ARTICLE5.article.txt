WASHINGTON — Senate farm
leaders are considering a blistering
report which puts much of the re
sponsibility for price "mark-ups' on
the middlemen, the food processors,
it was learned today.
The food price spiral, which began
with the start of hostilities in Korea,
has provided "little or no increase"
in prices for most of the farmers who
produce the food products, the re
port says.
"There is not so much need for
freezing the prices of meats," it says,
"as there k; for rolling back the mar
gins of the meat packers and the re
tailers to those existing prior to the
war in Korea.''
