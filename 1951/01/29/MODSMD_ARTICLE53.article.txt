# Braves Down Hamilton Field Flyers, 80 to 55
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's rampaging Braves, us
ing the last break to the utmost, j
routed a Hamilton Field five 80 to
53 Saturday in the Pavilion. The win i
marked the JV's third consecutive
victory.
The Braves literally "shot down" j
the Flyers through their excellent
sharp shooting from both in close
and out far.
Big Bill Stevenson had a day for

himself at the center spot, pouring j
home 21 points to lead the winners, j
fie had 17 in the first half. How
ever, airman Jesse Coffee copped the
day's individual scoring honors with

Braves Lead Early
The Braves jumped off to an early :
sturt and had a* commanding lead J
midway through the first period !
which was never threatened by the j
service team.
Forwards Dan Evans and Paul j
Johnson were on the shooting end of
a fast break which raced past the j
Hamilton Field defense time alter ;
time.
When Johnson and Evans weren't
in for set-ups, Fritz Fenster and j
George Zaninovich were meshing
buckets from their guard spots. All
this, coupled with the hooks and tips
of Stevenson, was too much for the
Flyers.
JV's Stronger in Second Half
Following an intermission lead of
!!T to 25, the Braves roared back J
stronger than ever to more than |
double their score while holding the I
airmen to 00.
Dick Schutte, former Brave cen- i
ter. was at one center post for the
Flyers, who used a double post of
fense, but was held to eight points |
by a tight Stanford defense.
What scoring punch the airmen '
did have was lost to them midway
through the second half when G-f't.
6-in. center Coffee fouled out. The i

Braves lost two of their seven-man
squad, Zaninovich and Tom DuFour,
j by the foul route. This necessitated
moving center Dan Wilbur to a for
i ward spot where he hit for six points.
