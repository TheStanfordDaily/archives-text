# NATIONAL BASKETBALL
## Bears Tumble LIU To Feature Weekend 
### 
|
Basketball standings went out of the window, and the PCC re- '
gained some of the prestige lost by UCLA and Stanford on their !
disastrous Eastern trips, a£ Cal bumped LIU 69 to 67 Saturday |
night on the Cow Palace floor.
The Easterners, ranked second in the nation, were obviously not j

used to Bears' running game, and
time and time again Larry Horan and
Billy Hagler outsprinted the Black
birds; and found themselves all alone ,
under the basket lor easy lay-ups.
LIU went ahead early in the game
on the towering performances of 6-ft. j
7-in. Sherman White and 6-ft. 10-in. '
Ray Felix. With seven or eight min
utes remaining in the first half, how
ever, the Bears, hitting well from the
outside and driving in through glar- j
ing holes in the Blackbird defense,

shot into the lead and were never i
headed.
Leading 28 to 26 at half-time, Cali- j
fornia spurted into a 42 to 32 ad- i
vantage in the early minutes of the |
second half, and the violently parti
san crowd began yelling for a rout.
However, Clair Bee, the Blackbird
coach, then held a hasty conference
with his players. And LIU, changing I
both its defensive and offensive, pat- !
torn, closed the gap to 51-49. and '
was within one point of the Bears at |
58-57 and 64-63.
But each time California again }
pulled ahead, and the Bears had a <
6S) to (55 advantage with only 20 sec- ]
onds remaining.
A Narrow Finish
Then, in a strange and torrid fin
ish, LlU's Belopolsky sank a field
goal just as the buzzer sounded, and
was fouled in the act. With the time
keeper ruling that one-half second
remained in the game, % the Black- j
birds elected to take the'ball out of |
bounds to try for another goal.
As the ball was in the air on the i
in-bounds pass, the game ended.
The win was all the more remark- !
able for the fact that only on the j
night before the Bears had dropped j
a 53 to 52 decision to Santa Clara's I
upset-bucking Broncos.
In the opener of Saturday night's i
double bill, San Francisco showed !
the effects of having kept up wtih !
LIU point for point on the previous j
night, when they had faded only in j
the late minutes to lose 58 to 52.
UCLA Plows USF
They gave the most inept per- j
formance of the season on the Cow ;
Palace floor, as UCLA plowed them !
under 75 to 42.
The Uclans had little trouble in I
defeating Arizona, which was ranked
among the nation's top teams with a I
13-2 record and counted among its j
victims CCNY, last year's national j
champions.
The Arizonans gained some meas- !
ure of revenge on Saturday night, j
downing the San Jose Spartans G2 to j
55. Earlier in the evening on the j
same Hoor the St. Mary's cagers I
turned the tables on the Santa Clara !
Broncos, upsetting themd 60 to 59.
Northern PCC Play
Although there was no conference j
competition in the PCC Southern I
Division over the weekend, the j
Northern Division race became still
more scrambled.
Washington, the pre-season favor- j
ite, dropped another contest, this !
time to Idaho 60 to 55. and now has I
only an outside chance to cop the j
title.
In the meantime unheralded Ore
gon climbed into a first-place tie J
with Washington State by drubbing
Oregon St:ite twice, 62 to 53 and 66
to 47.
In what may turn out to have been 1
the game of the year, the Bradley !
Braves, Stanford's foes in the Cow
Palace this Saturday, dropped a 1
heart-breaking 49 to 48 decision to j
the Oklahoma Ags Friday night in
Peoria, 111.
The game was tied up at 48-all at ,
the end of the regular period, and in l
the overtime period both teams went j
into a stall. Then, with only three j
seconds remaining in the overtime i
period, the Aggies scored the win- !
ning point on a free throw.
