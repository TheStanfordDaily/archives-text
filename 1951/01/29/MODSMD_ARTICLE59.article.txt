What makes a winner?
Well, its far as pitcher Joe Chez
is concerned, it's condition. And in
: Joe's case, it must be admitted that
condition paid oft for him last year,
t Not only did the sophomore ace lead
the champion Indian mound staff
but he also was league high with
j seven wins and no defeats.
If you care to equal Joe's condi
tioning routine, it goes something
| like this:
Run out from the gym to the Sun
ken Diamond and take two laps
1 around. Then jog over to the Sta
| dium and run up the 72 Stadium
j seats five times. When you have this
i mastered, try skipping every other
| row just to make it harder. Run
back to the Sunken Diamond and do
nine 50 - yard wind sprints. Then
race back to the gym and work out
on the weights and pulleys.
If there's time left, finish up with
a game of basketball, take a shower
I (cold preferably), and ride a bike
i home.
Says Joe, "I haven't been running
I the Stadium steps as much as I used
j to. There's such a thing as overdo-
I >"git."
