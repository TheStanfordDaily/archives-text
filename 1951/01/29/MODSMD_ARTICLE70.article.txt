# Set Changes Make 'Trial' Real Trial
## 
### 
''The Trial," the Stanford Plavcrs'
presentation which opens in the Me
morial Auditorium Thursday night,
would have been produced at San
Jose State but for the limited stage
facilities there that proved inade
quate for the complex, multi-scene
Andre Gide play.
The play contains 17 scene
changes, many of which have sub
scenes within them. Stanford's set
designer Wendell Cole has hanr'led
this problem by building two pedes
tals, one on each side of the stage,
which swing in when thev are to be
used, in action comparable to that
of a jackknife.
The difficult staging is directed by
F. Cowles Strickland. He was asked
to take on the job by James Clancy,
Iromer Stanford student now teach
ing drama at San Jose State, who
plays the central role of Joseph K.
The play will run Thursday
through Saturday nights. Tickets
sell for 90 cents and may be pur
chased at the Memorial Auditorium
box office. For reservations call DA
3-0665.
