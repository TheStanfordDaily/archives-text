## 
### 
Three top University officials
| — President Wallace Sterling,
Chairman of the Hoover Insti
tute Harold Fisher, and Dean
Carl Spaeth of the LaW School—
were reported yesterday after
noon as unopposed to sending a
student delegate to the Rome
Congress in April as some 25
students met with Excom in a
special open session.
Representatives, however, spent
the better part of twp hours debating
whether or not the student body is
"for" the two-week-old proposal,
which aims to send a Farm student to
the "Fourth Annual Congress of the
Movement for World Federal Gov
ernment," April 2-9.
In a one-sentence statement is
sued earlier in the day to off-cam
pus representative Gil Jonas, Presi
dent Sterling reportedly wrote,
"the University does not oppose
this (the Rome delegate proposal)."
Chairman Fisher also stated that he
knew "no reason why a real contri
bution cannot be made ... if a
competent delegate is chosen," Jonas
asserted.
Junior Class representative Dick
O'Connell, in an interview with
Law School Dean Spaeth, said the
latter was "definitely for the con
gress."
O'Connell, who is a member of a
three - man Excom subcommittee
named to investigate the congress,
I said "it appears the Stanford delegate
would get a vote at the congress.
However, he said he could not yet
give a definite ruling on the point.
Questioning student body reac
tion to the proposal, Men's Halls
representative Phil Saeta asked the
body whether a majority of stu
dents arc for world government.
Saeta indicated he doubted the
amount of student reaction to the
reports of a delegate ence he had
returned from the confab. "Does
all this 'ustify the expense?" Saeta
concluded.
Countering, Jonas said "we should
do something to promote student
| opinion on world government." He
,said the Rome congress presents one
of the best answers to world organ
ization found thus far.
Interested student Bill Jarvis, la
beling the purpose of the congress as
one of world federation, doubted
whether federalism is the answer to
world peace. He said the congress
will act to "rubber stamp" a federal
! ist constitution prepared by ex-Uni
versity of Chicago President Robert
Hutchins and passed at a Paris con
vention last June.
Representative O'Connell, how
ever, took issue with Jarvis, assert
ing that the congress is "certainly
not a rubber stamp," and would
encompass a delegation "larger
m and much different" from (hat at
tending the Paris convention.
Senior class representative Gordy
Campbell, also a member of the in
vestigating committee, stated "I don't
think we should send a delegate un
less this organization (ASSU) is
sponsoring world federal govern-
J ment."
Excom's newest member, Graduate
representative Harry Rowe, named
Russia as the "biggest problem in
world peace today." He indicated
that a "world peace" conference
would do little to change the opin
ions of that country and her satel
lites.

named to investigate the congress,
I said "it appears the Stanford delegate
would get a vote at the congress.
However, he said he could not yet
give a definite ruling on the point.
Questioning student body reac
tion to the proposal, Men's Halls
representative Phil Saeta asked the
body whether a majority of stu
dents arc for world government.
Saeta indicated he doubted the
amount of student reaction to the
reports of a delegate ence he had

all this 'ustify the expense?" Saeta
concluded.
Countering, Jonas said "we should
do something to promote student

of the best answers to world organ
ization found thus far.
Interested student Bill Jarvis, la
beling the purpose of the congress as
one of world federation, doubted

versity of Chicago President Robert
Hutchins and passed at a Paris con
vention last June.
Representative O'Connell, how

ing that the congress is "certainly
not a rubber stamp," and would
encompass a delegation "larger

student delegate to the Rome
Congress in April as some 25

whether or not the student body is

In a one-sentence statement is

knew "no reason why a real contri

competent delegate is chosen," Jonas
asserted.
