# Theta Chi Remodeling Is Finished

### WALLY WHITE 
All's quiet on the Theta Chi front.
The cement mixer is gone, the
buzz saws have departed, and only
the bull sessions of the brothers arc
to be heard.
When the foreman for the R. L.
Wilson Co. of San Francisco left the
job last week, it marked the end of
a nine-month reconstruction on the
front of the house, costing more than
$62,000.
Long Planning
The large, tile - roofed Spanish
building at Arguello Street and Al
varado Row is the result of many
years of planning and waiting, said
Art Brown, Theta Chi president. Re
construction of the original Theta
Chi house began in 1935, when the
rear half was rebuilt and enlarged
at a cost of $28,000.
Then came years of gathering
money and consulting with architect
Will B. Corlett of Oakland. Last
May, negotiations were completed
with the contractor, and workmen
began tearing down the white clap
board front of the house.
To the Rear
The brothers were pushed to the
rear of the building. "All last quar
ter we were without a living room
or athletic area," Brown said. "Three
men were living in two-man rooms.
We had six fellows in the game room
and six more in the chapter room."
Now, except for two light fixtures,
the house is completed. One of the
largest houses on campus, it accom
modates up to 50 men. Furnishing of
the new living room and library was
handled by the Theta Chi Mothers'
Club and active Fred Koenig, who
worked with a Palo Alto decorator.
The white stucco fraternity house
is a far cry from the original struc

turc. A gabled, white frame house,
the building was erected in Mayfield
aruond the turn of the century. It
was later moved to a site near Bran
ner Hall and finally to its present lo
cation.
It has becti in the possession of
Sigma Nu, Alpha Sigma Phi, and
finally' Theta Chi.
