# Adjustment to Enrollment Drops
## 
### 
The prospect of a sweeping enrollment drop
by next fall causes us to consider daily the ad
justments which faculty, administration, and
students will have to make. Outwardly, the
registration decrease from 7,400 to 5,t>00 re
solves itself to a financial problem.
To the University a slide of 1,800 in enroll
ment figures means $1,188,000 less annual in
come, and to the ASSU it means a $27,000 drop.
The items demanding expenses on both the
University and the ASSU budgets are not as
lexible as the income side of the ledger is.
:or example, the University has a certain fixed
oost for faculty salaries, which cannot drop
nuch without weakening the whole curricu
lum. However, the income from tuition is al
ready skidding fast as fewer and fewer return
o register.
To decrease the salary expenditures, some
:aculty cuts will be necessary. The University
Operates on a tenure system which provides
tife tenure for professors, five-year tenure for
associate professors, three-year tenure for as
sistant professors, and one year for instructors.
The term "acting" before a professorial rank
criminates any tenure provision.
If some men without tenure are cut froiji the
staff, higher ranking faculty members may be
required to teach freshman and elementary
courses in the various departments. This phase
rjf the readjustment seems like a real benefit.
In considering the effects of the enrollment
drop on the ASSU budget it becomes apparent
that the student representatives are headed for
a hot and heavy budget session.
An example which hits us close to home, is
the-Daily subsidy which is dependent on one
fifth of the ASSU income. Although there
might well be over $5,000 less coming to the
Daily as a result of the enrollment drop, the
fixed cost of putting out a paper remains about
the same whether you print 5,500 or 7,500
papers.
Perhaps the answer to the financial problems
is to operate at somewhat of a deficitâ€”dipping
into University or student body reserve funds,
as the case might be. Although the enrollment
cut seems rather drastic at the time, the Ad
ministration has indicated that within three
years the registration figures might be stabil

ized at a level closer to the present totals.
Dean Winbigler has suggested that by next
year at this time many war veterans will have
served their 21 months and will be ready to
return to college, thereby compensating for the
draft attrition hitting colleges now.
Although draft legislation is still uncertain,
we must assume that some class or age group
will be hit harder than others.
For instance, should an 18-year-old draft
order go into effect, next year's freshman class
would be hit.
However, it seems likely that a good-sized,
well-qualified class of '55 could be enrolled.
Some men will not become 18 until after the fall
term opens, while some 18-year-olds would not
be called because it would take most of the
summer for the government to get the lower-,
age and induction procedure in operation.
If instead of an 18-year-old draft law. Con
gress decides to banish deferments for some
college students in order to fill defense quotas,
next year's sophomore class woyld be the most
susceptible.
Because of this possible sophomore attrition
Stanford is very fortunate in having the largest
freshman class this year in its history.
There is a definite correlation between our
analysis of the draft proposals and the prob
lems presented by an enrollment drop.
Although the financial "bind" is the main
problem a* first glance, there are even more
considerations attached to enrollment figures.
Should the enrollment cuts occur among
lower division students, lower division curricu
lum studies, freshman sponsoring, and fresh
man advisory committees would no longer be
the center of attention. Instead, Excom would
have to concentrate on upper division and
graduate activities and the administration
would be concerned more with seminars and
independent study courses at the advanced
academic level.
The most important consideration in this
period of enrollment adjustment is that stu
dents and faculty anticipate the changes which
will be necessary. The changes will involve
long-term thinking* at the Excom budget ses
sions, at Student-Faculty Education Commis
sion meetings, and in faculty staff meetings.
