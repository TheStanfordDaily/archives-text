### GEORGE STEWART 
THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL—We moored at
Balboa dock after only one incident of note coming
through the locks.
In the last one, the YANKEE almost found herself
jammed into the lock sideways. The combination of

v '
an unmanageable current arising
lrom the preceding lock and a
doped-up dock worker who
couldn't seem to find time to put
our starboard bow line on the bol
lard at the side of the lock, almost
proved disastrous.
The following day, Bob LoomLs
arrange a tour through Gatun
Locks conducted by the lock su
porintendent.

1" rorn the control tower we watched a ship going
down to the Caribbean. It is a fact that the lock boys
don't dare put their fingers over the edge of the ob
servation platform rail when an Essex class carrier

is making the transit. - The danger of losing or smash
ing fingers between the rail and gun turrets on the
carrier's side is not to be laughed at.
By way of example, the "Big Mo," in her rush to
get to Korea, slammed through the locks at night
with only six inches to spare on each side.
Next we went inside the tower and down the inner
ladders to view the lock machinery. What surprised
us most was the fact that everything—every piece of
machinery and control apparatus—is the same equip
ment as went into operation in 1913 when the locks
first opened.

Most of us felt a tinge of remorse at sailing from
Balboa Island on Nov. 28. It meant the end of the
government-run clubhouse, our source of free show
ers, a swimming pool. American movies, States-side
beer, ice cream, and up-to-date newspapers.
But sailors' restlessness got the better of us, and we
were driven on by the urge of new and different ports.
