## On Donald Close... 
### 
To the E<litor:
I have twice seen Mr. Donald E. Close threatened
with bodily harm by a student here at Stanford. This
student, whoever he is, seems to be either guided by
a distorted sense of patriotism or feels he has been
personally insulted and perhaps harmfully affected by
Mr. Close s outspoken philosophy.
Close's right to express his views is hardly debat
able. It seems to me that an American ought to be
'eady to delend Mr. Closes rights ol free speech and

thought rather than persecute him for exercising
those rights.

To the Editor:
After reading the recent "Bull Session" expose of
Donald E. Close by our local nemesis of discrimination,
we wonder how many of Mr. Palmieri's fraternity
brothers are Negroes. Orientals, and Jews.
