# Grotto Club Explores Mother Lode Caves
## 
### PAULINE KUNZ 
Five intrepid Farm roughs of the Stanford Cave Club spent a
recent weekend exploring the most difficult underground terrain
that they have yet encountered.
The Black Chasm Volcano, located near the village of Volcano,
a "thriving ghost town" in the Mother Lode country near Jack-

son, was the scene of their explora
tions. Volcano is an old mining town
famous for the surrounding caves, of
which Black Chasm is apparently
the largest.
The chasm itself is a limestone
cavern consisting primarily of one
fissure 180 feet deep. Since there are
no foot or hand holds for the first 120
feet, the explorers had to depend en
tirely on their rope ladders. In addi
; lion, a heavy mist filled the chasm
and limited the visibility to a max
imum of 20 feet. The mist, which
soon turned into rain, increased the
difficulty of the descent, the rope
ladders becoming covered with mud
and tangled together.
When the club members finally
reached the bottom of the chasm,
they found a limestone cavern of
grotesque proportions. In one cave,
which the Stanford Indians appro
priately named the "Scalp Room,"
they found long tresses of cave li
chen ranging up to 15 feet hanging
| from the ceiling.
Of the 12 hours spent in the cave,
! four hours were devoted to descend
j inii, six to ascending, and only two
| hours to actual exploring and col
] iecting. The Stanfordites found it
| necessary to sacrifice 90 feet of
I climbing rope and 70 feet of rope
| ladder—s2o worth of equipment.
Cave Club members Ray Bennet.
i Chuck Moller, Jack Weicker, Jack
Jacobus, and Art Lange are unani
mous in one determination. They
j are going to wait for the next
drought before venturing to explore
the Black Chasm Volcano again.
