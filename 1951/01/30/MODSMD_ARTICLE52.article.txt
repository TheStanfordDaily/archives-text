# Card Varsity Prepping For Stewart Chevvies, Bradley
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baskctballers
will return to the cage wars with a
vengeance this weekend when they
emerge from a two-week hiberna
tion to take part in a doublebeader
fraught with national significance.
First on the docket is a Thursday
evening get-together in the Pavilion
with Hank Luisetti's tiilcnt - laden
Stewart Chevv s es. Saturday they
move to San Francisco's Cow Palace
for the week's headline intersec
tiofial with Bradley University.
It's a pretty tall order for one
week's competition. The Chevvies
are currently running second in the
powerful AAU National Industrial
League, second onlv to the legen
dary Oilers of Bartlesville. And the
Peoria Braves rank fourth among
thu nation's college teams on the
basis of an 18 and 3 record.
Loss number three, incidentally,
was recorded only Saturday night
when the Braves dropped an eyelash
decision to Oklahoma A&M, 49 to 48.
another contender for the national
crown.
Physical condition of the Indians,

an all - important factor in view of
Everett Dean's woefully short bench,
should be the best of the year for the
week's important activities. A light
practice schedule last week, followed
by an idle weekend, provided the
team with its first real relaxation
after a hectic Eastern trip and con
ference openers.

While Dean won't admit it, it J
would appear safe to assume that
Stanford's preparations this week
will be concentrated primarily on |
the Saturday show. A win over the j
Stewarts would naturally be appre- |
dated; but a good ileal more national
prestige could be had by knocking !
