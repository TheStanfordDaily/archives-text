No Pressure osi SAB for Crid (loach;
Choice May lie Made This Saturday
*
People are beginning to wonder what's happening around the Farm. No '
noise about what football coach Stanford must get. No one jumping up and '
down screaming. "We don't want anybody but Paul Brown." No petitions ,
floating around campus for a particular coach, "no matter what the cost."
You ask why?
Well, it's this way: the Stanford Athletic Board, like the Marines, have
the situation well in hand. It seems that we've been very fortunate in that j
there have been no pressure groups, alumni or otherwise, telling the Board |
who to choose and who not to choose. This leaves the SAB. composed of
three students, three alumni, and three members of the faculty, free to sit
down quietly and consider the merits of each prospective coach without j
someone breathing down their necks.
The fact that the three group.-; have equal representation on the Board is !
& not her reason why the selection of Marchie Schwartz's replacement is I
being made without a lot of luss. At USC. for instance, the athletic board is :
controlled mainly by the faculty. That's one of the causes of all the hula- j
baloo down there these days. We're not sure about Cal at present, but in |
BW (Before Waldorf) the board was, on the other hand, under student con- 1
trol.
This led to the selection ol five football coaches in four years before '
Pappy popped up. As far as SC is concerned the faculty has riled the alumni :
so much that their yelling has floated over ev\ny goal post in the country. I
The way things look now, a man'rl he fool to coach El Troj, because, unless i
he's just come down out of the mountains, he's going to realize that he's !
about 14th best, at least on the SC alumni list.
Marchie Wasn't Pushed
Another reason why cool heads prevail at the table of the Stanford Board !
is the fact that, while Jell' Cravath got the old bum's rush down South, j
Marchie walked out on the tail of a great victory in the East-West game |
and at the beginning of a brand new five-year contract. He even told AJ j
Masters ho would keep his eye out for good football material and would ■
de his best to head them in the direction of the Farm. In other words—and I
this is to impress those very, very few who think they were responsible for :
Marc hie s exit—Mr. Schwartz went out of his own free will and with nothing
but the friendliest of feelings all the way around.
The situation at present is this: the Stanford Board has under considera- :
tion a list of approximately !!() prospective men for the position of Head
Footbal Coach. Although a few names have been bandied about, in thd
form ol rumors, particularly Chuck Taylor, ex-frosh coach and presently
line coach with the San Francisco '49ers, the Athletic Board is releasing j
no names officially yet for two simple reasons:
1. A few people might not even be interested in the job, and it might
prove embarrassing for them at their present locations if their names
were published.
2. If a person were named as a possibility and then later was not offered
the position of Stanford's next coach, his friends and co-workers might
wonder why he didn't get the job.
You can easily see that this is not only good public relations, but it makes '
it easier for a man, perhaps a "name" coach, to ask to be considered for the
post without undue publicity.
Race Still Open
At the last meeting of the-Stanford Board two weeks ago, the members, '
working as a screening committee, extracted for the 30-odd candidates five
or six names as first to be considered. This in no way implies that the race j
is narrowed to those half-dozen men. The position of head football coach is, .
still wide open, and if a coach from Lonesome Pines U. in Addlebrain, Mis
souri, shows up, he'll be considered.
Rumors have it that Stanford is going to lie low for the duration of this i
Korean situation, and we'd like to take it upon ourselves to straighten out 1
that matter.
In selecting the replacement for Marchie Schwartz, the Stanford Athletic !
Board must consider two things. The first, naturally, is the world situation.
You can't get away from it. And the second is finances.
If the world situation doesn't take a turn for the worse between now and
next fall, and we can't find anyone to guarantee that. Stanford will field
a football team. That's been assured by reliable sources. However, one
never knows what's going to happen tomorrow, does one? But the Athletic
Board is going on the assumption that football will continue at Stanford !
next year, and therefore, they are not thinking in terms of just any coach.
The financial situation crops up, though. Stanford, the school for the
"sons of the wealthy few" doesn't seem to have a limitless athletic coffer.
And. unlike Ohio State or USC. we can't find anyone willing to scrape up
an extra 40 or 50 thousand and an added inducement. We are, however,
about average, financially speaking, for a university of our reputation and j
size and are in a position of offer the right price to a good coach. And rest 1
assured, we will have a good coach, no matter who it might be.
PCC Schools in One Bout
One other point should be brought out. During the last war, the schools
on the Coast who continued their football programs were those who had
Navy units enrolled. The Navy permitted their men to play for the schools. |
Stanford, at the time, had only an Army unit, whose men were not allowed 1
to play. But today with the Army-Navy unification plan in effect, no one
knows what effect it will have on the athletic set-up. With a Naval Reserve
program at Stanford now, it looks like we're all in the same boat at ldast. j
Only time will tell.
This Saturday, Feb. .'S, the Stanford Athletic Board will meet again. At
this time it is highly possible, if not probably that out of this meeting will
come the name of Stanford's next football coach. „
Particularly interested in the outcome will be the Cards' present coaching
staff. They are well aware that their future on the Farm is entirely de
pendent on the man who replaces Marchie Schwartz.

BW (Before Waldorf) the board was, on the other hand, under student con- 1
trol.
This led to the selection ol five football coaches in four years before '
Pappy popped up. As far as SC is concerned the faculty has riled the alumni :
so much that their yelling has floated over ev\ny goal post in the country. I
The way things look now, a man'rl he fool to coach El Troj, because, unless i
he's just come down out of the mountains, he's going to realize that he's !
about 14th best, at least on the SC alumni list.
Marchie Wasn't Pushed
Another reason why cool heads prevail at the table of the Stanford Board !
is the fact that, while Jell' Cravath got the old bum's rush down South, j
Marchie walked out on the tail of a great victory in the East-West game |
and at the beginning of a brand new five-year contract. He even told AJ j
Masters ho would keep his eye out for good football material and would ■
de his best to head them in the direction of the Farm. In other words—and I
this is to impress those very, very few who think they were responsible for :
Marc hie s exit—Mr. Schwartz went out of his own free will and with nothing
but the friendliest of feelings all the way around.
The situation at present is this: the Stanford Board has under considera- :
tion a list of approximately !!() prospective men for the position of Head
Footbal Coach. Although a few names have been bandied about, in thd
form ol rumors, particularly Chuck Taylor, ex-frosh coach and presently
line coach with the San Francisco '49ers, the Athletic Board is releasing j
no names officially yet for two simple reasons:
1. A few people might not even be interested in the job, and it might
prove embarrassing for them at their present locations if their names
were published.
2. If a person were named as a possibility and then later was not offered
the position of Stanford's next coach, his friends and co-workers might
wonder why he didn't get the job.
You can easily see that this is not only good public relations, but it makes '
it easier for a man, perhaps a "name" coach, to ask to be considered for the
post without undue publicity.
Race Still Open
At the last meeting of the-Stanford Board two weeks ago, the members, '
working as a screening committee, extracted for the 30-odd candidates five
or six names as first to be considered. This in no way implies that the race j
is narrowed to those half-dozen men. The position of head football coach is, .
still wide open, and if a coach from Lonesome Pines U. in Addlebrain, Mis
souri, shows up, he'll be considered.
Rumors have it that Stanford is going to lie low for the duration of this i
Korean situation, and we'd like to take it upon ourselves to straighten out 1
that matter.
In selecting the replacement for Marchie Schwartz, the Stanford Athletic !
Board must consider two things. The first, naturally, is the world situation.
You can't get away from it. And the second is finances.
If the world situation doesn't take a turn for the worse between now and
next fall, and we can't find anyone to guarantee that. Stanford will field
a football team. That's been assured by reliable sources. However, one
never knows what's going to happen tomorrow, does one? But the Athletic
Board is going on the assumption that football will continue at Stanford !
next year, and therefore, they are not thinking in terms of just any coach.
The financial situation crops up, though. Stanford, the school for the
"sons of the wealthy few" doesn't seem to have a limitless athletic coffer.
And. unlike Ohio State or USC. we can't find anyone willing to scrape up
an extra 40 or 50 thousand and an added inducement. We are, however,
about average, financially speaking, for a university of our reputation and j
size and are in a position of offer the right price to a good coach. And rest 1
assured, we will have a good coach, no matter who it might be.
PCC Schools in One Bout
One other point should be brought out. During the last war, the schools
on the Coast who continued their football programs were those who had
Navy units enrolled. The Navy permitted their men to play for the schools. |
Stanford, at the time, had only an Army unit, whose men were not allowed 1
to play. But today with the Army-Navy unification plan in effect, no one
knows what effect it will have on the athletic set-up. With a Naval Reserve
program at Stanford now, it looks like we're all in the same boat at ldast. j
Only time will tell.
This Saturday, Feb. .'S, the Stanford Athletic Board will meet again. At
this time it is highly possible, if not probably that out of this meeting will
come the name of Stanford's next football coach. „
Particularly interested in the outcome will be the Cards' present coaching
staff. They are well aware that their future on the Farm is entirely de
pendent on the man who replaces Marchie Schwartz.

People are beginning to wonder what's happening around the Farm. No '
noise about what football coach Stanford must get. No one jumping up and '
down screaming. "We don't want anybody but Paul Brown." No petitions ,
floating around campus for a particular coach, "no matter what the cost."
You ask why?
Well, it's this way: the Stanford Athletic Board, like the Marines, have
the situation well in hand. It seems that we've been very fortunate in that j
there have been no pressure groups, alumni or otherwise, telling the Board |
who to choose and who not to choose. This leaves the SAB. composed of
three students, three alumni, and three members of the faculty, free to sit
down quietly and consider the merits of each prospective coach without j
someone breathing down their necks.

Marc hie s exit—Mr. Schwartz went out of his own free will and with nothing
but the friendliest of feelings all the way around.
The situation at present is this: the Stanford Board has under considera- :
tion a list of approximately !!() prospective men for the position of Head
Footbal Coach. Although a few names have been bandied about, in thd
form ol rumors, particularly Chuck Taylor, ex-frosh coach and presently
line coach with the San Francisco '49ers, the Athletic Board is releasing j
no names officially yet for two simple reasons:
1. A few people might not even be interested in the job, and it might
prove embarrassing for them at their present locations if their names
were published.
2. If a person were named as a possibility and then later was not offered
the position of Stanford's next coach, his friends and co-workers might
wonder why he didn't get the job.
You can easily see that this is not only good public relations, but it makes '
it easier for a man, perhaps a "name" coach, to ask to be considered for the
post without undue publicity.
Race Still Open
At the last meeting of the-Stanford Board two weeks ago, the members, '
working as a screening committee, extracted for the 30-odd candidates five
or six names as first to be considered. This in no way implies that the race j
is narrowed to those half-dozen men. The position of head football coach is, .
still wide open, and if a coach from Lonesome Pines U. in Addlebrain, Mis
souri, shows up, he'll be considered.
Rumors have it that Stanford is going to lie low for the duration of this i
Korean situation, and we'd like to take it upon ourselves to straighten out 1
that matter.
In selecting the replacement for Marchie Schwartz, the Stanford Athletic !
Board must consider two things. The first, naturally, is the world situation.
You can't get away from it. And the second is finances.
If the world situation doesn't take a turn for the worse between now and
next fall, and we can't find anyone to guarantee that. Stanford will field
a football team. That's been assured by reliable sources. However, one
never knows what's going to happen tomorrow, does one? But the Athletic
Board is going on the assumption that football will continue at Stanford !
next year, and therefore, they are not thinking in terms of just any coach.
The financial situation crops up, though. Stanford, the school for the
"sons of the wealthy few" doesn't seem to have a limitless athletic coffer.
And. unlike Ohio State or USC. we can't find anyone willing to scrape up
an extra 40 or 50 thousand and an added inducement. We are, however,
about average, financially speaking, for a university of our reputation and j
size and are in a position of offer the right price to a good coach. And rest 1
assured, we will have a good coach, no matter who it might be.
PCC Schools in One Bout
One other point should be brought out. During the last war, the schools
on the Coast who continued their football programs were those who had
Navy units enrolled. The Navy permitted their men to play for the schools. |
Stanford, at the time, had only an Army unit, whose men were not allowed 1
to play. But today with the Army-Navy unification plan in effect, no one
knows what effect it will have on the athletic set-up. With a Naval Reserve
program at Stanford now, it looks like we're all in the same boat at ldast. j
Only time will tell.
This Saturday, Feb. .'S, the Stanford Athletic Board will meet again. At
this time it is highly possible, if not probably that out of this meeting will
come the name of Stanford's next football coach. „
Particularly interested in the outcome will be the Cards' present coaching
staff. They are well aware that their future on the Farm is entirely de
pendent on the man who replaces Marchie Schwartz.
No Pressure osi SAB for Crid (loach;
Choice May lie Made This Saturday
*
People are beginning to wonder what's happening around the Farm. No '
noise about what football coach Stanford must get. No one jumping up and '
down screaming. "We don't want anybody but Paul Brown." No petitions ,
floating around campus for a particular coach, "no matter what the cost."
You ask why?
Well, it's this way: the Stanford Athletic Board, like the Marines, have
the situation well in hand. It seems that we've been very fortunate in that j
there have been no pressure groups, alumni or otherwise, telling the Board |
who to choose and who not to choose. This leaves the SAB. composed of
three students, three alumni, and three members of the faculty, free to sit
down quietly and consider the merits of each prospective coach without j
someone breathing down their necks.
The fact that the three group.-; have equal representation on the Board is !
& not her reason why the selection of Marchie Schwartz's replacement is I
being made without a lot of luss. At USC. for instance, the athletic board is :
controlled mainly by the faculty. That's one of the causes of all the hula- j
baloo down there these days. We're not sure about Cal at present, but in |
BW (Before Waldorf) the board was, on the other hand, under student con- 1
trol.
This led to the selection ol five football coaches in four years before '
Pappy popped up. As far as SC is concerned the faculty has riled the alumni :
so much that their yelling has floated over ev\ny goal post in the country. I
The way things look now, a man'rl he fool to coach El Troj, because, unless i
he's just come down out of the mountains, he's going to realize that he's !
about 14th best, at least on the SC alumni list.
Marchie Wasn't Pushed
Another reason why cool heads prevail at the table of the Stanford Board !
is the fact that, while Jell' Cravath got the old bum's rush down South, j
Marchie walked out on the tail of a great victory in the East-West game |
and at the beginning of a brand new five-year contract. He even told AJ j
Masters ho would keep his eye out for good football material and would ■
de his best to head them in the direction of the Farm. In other words—and I
this is to impress those very, very few who think they were responsible for :
Marc hie s exit—Mr. Schwartz went out of his own free will and with nothing
