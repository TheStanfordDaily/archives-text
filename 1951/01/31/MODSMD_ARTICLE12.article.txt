# Marshall Plan Aids Greek Recovery, Asserts Hansen

"Twice before I have appeared on
this platform and presented a grim
picture of a Greece torn by civil war.
Tonight, I can say that the black
picture of two years ago has now
changed to an uncertain grey," Dr.
Hazel D. Hansen told a Tuesday
Evening Series audience last night.
Marshall Plan aid has accounted
for a great deal of progress in Greece
since its introduction 1947, Dr.
Hansen reported.
Transportation has improved both
on the ground and in the air with
scheduled trains running and airlines
operating efficiently.
Civil war havoc is being repaired.
Half of the 700,000 homeless one
tenth of Greece's population has been
re-housed, given a mule, $35 per
month, and three bread rations per
day.
Hospitals and medical stations have
been set up by Marshall Plan aid
and are caring for people who have
never before had medical attention.

But there are still unsolved prob
lems.
"The United States considers the
creation of a dynamic government
the major political problem," Dr.
Hansen said.
Dr. Hansen termed the Greeks
"children, politically." She said that
the August 1947 cabinet crisis in
which Greece was for three weeks
without a government made the
United States realize that it had to
take a strong stand on Greek polit
ical problems if Marshall Plan aid
was to be at all effective.
The result was a cumbersome,
slow-moving. U.S.-sponsored coali
tion of Rights and Populists that
lasted only two years. In spite of
itself, the United States found itself
a part of the only properly function
ing body of the government, the De
fense Council, Dr. Hansen stated.
"The United Spates has long wanted
a broad coalition government cap
able of handling U.S. aid, but it re
mains to seen if the present Lib
eral-Rightist-Social Democrat coali
tion elected in September will satisfy
that hope," Dr. Hansen asserted.
A vital factor in the rehabilitation
of Greece is whether or not she can
set up a stable government. Since
1946, there have been 20 different
governments, 7 in the past year," Dr.
Hansen reported.
"We have done and are doing a
good job," Dr. Hansen concluded,
"but we must do more. Spirtually
and mentally we have contributed
nothing."

the major political problem," Dr.
Hansen said.
Dr. Hansen termed the Greeks
"children, politically." She said that
the August 1947 cabinet crisis in
which Greece was for three weeks
without a government made the
United States realize that it had to
take a strong stand on Greek polit
ical problems if Marshall Plan aid
was to be at all effective.
The result was a cumbersome,
slow-moving. U.S.-sponsored coali
tion of Rights and Populists that
lasted only two years. In spite of
itself, the United States found itself
a part of the only properly function
ing body of the government, the De
fense Council, Dr. Hansen stated.
"The United Spates has long wanted
a broad coalition government cap
able of handling U.S. aid, but it re
mains to seen if the present Lib
eral-Rightist-Social Democrat coali
tion elected in September will satisfy
that hope," Dr. Hansen asserted.
A vital factor in the rehabilitation
of Greece is whether or not she can
set up a stable government. Since
1946, there have been 20 different
governments, 7 in the past year," Dr.
Hansen reported.
"We have done and are doing a
good job," Dr. Hansen concluded,
"but we must do more. Spirtually
and mentally we have contributed
nothing."
"Twice before I have appeared on
this platform and presented a grim
picture of a Greece torn by civil war.
Tonight, I can say that the black
picture of two years ago has now
changed to an uncertain grey," Dr.
Hazel D. Hansen told a Tuesday
Evening Series audience last night.
Marshall Plan aid has accounted
for a great deal of progress in Greece
since its introduction 1947, Dr.
Hansen reported.
Transportation has improved both
on the ground and in the air with
scheduled trains running and airlines
operating efficiently.
Civil war havoc is being repaired.
Half of the 700,000 homeless one
tenth of Greece's population has been
re-housed, given a mule, $35 per
month, and three bread rations per
day.
Hospitals and medical stations have
been set up by Marshall Plan aid
and are caring for people who have
never before had medical attention.

But there are still unsolved prob
lems.
"The United States considers the
creation of a dynamic government
the major political problem," Dr.
Hansen said.
