TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 31 â€”
United Nations land, sea, and air
forces hammered the Communists
back up to six miles on the Seoul
front and all across Korea yesterday
in a general offensive now blazing up
on the east coast.
Western front dispatches disclosed
that the Eighth Army had battled to
positions nine miles northwest of
Suwon, although the toughest re
sistance of the six-day drive slowed
the pace directly south of Seoul.
Some units advanced up to six miles
along the west coast.
