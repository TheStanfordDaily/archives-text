# Student Polls Opinion On Rome Delegate War
## 
### 
The red hot controversy over send
ing a delegate to the Rome Peace
Conference April 2-J) still has the
campus in a rash. Another battle will
be waged tonight when Excom meets
to consider the problem.
To help students understand and
evaluate the issues involved, Harvey
Wagner, ASSU debate manager,
polled the opinions of persons sup
porting and opposing the proposal.
Wagner discovered little agreement
between the two factions. The only
major issue without strong opposition
is the method of selecting a delegate.
Both sides agree on a student refer
endum after sufficient publicity has
been given.
No More Compromises
From there on, there is no com
promise. Proponents say the con
gress' purpose is to promote world
federal government for a just peace,
whle opponents claim the congress is
a rubber stamp supporting world
government.
Supporters say a Stanford delegate
would contribute to the congress and
its panels, while the "anti" camp
maintains he would only be'able to
vote on issues already settled.
Stanford will assume college lead
ership in international affairs and
will combat the hopelessness and
apathy prevalent on college cam
puses by sending a delegate, sup
porters claim.
The opposition says the $761 cost

could be used to better advantage by
sponsoring peace and world co-oper
ation through other activities. The
opposition also claims the students
would gain no information about
world peace other than the ideas and
impediments faced by one group, the
World Federalists who are sponsor
ing the congress.
Those in favor of sending a dele
gate say students would receive edu
cational benefits in the form of in
struction on steps toward peace.
Campus groups backing the pro
posal are the lIR, Atlantic Union,
Student Federalists, and NAACP.
Aligned against the proposal are
the Interfraternity Council and Row
Excom.
