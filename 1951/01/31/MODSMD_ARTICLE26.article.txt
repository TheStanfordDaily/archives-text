# Scratchin's From the Editor's Pen
## 
### 
When a person starts looking at the prob-
Vrns and controversies at other colleges, he
can't help but think how fortunate Stanford is.
&S the results of the semi-annual Daily election
iiake headlines today, we are aware of the un
pleasant situation at UCLA, where the student
council is storming around their chambers be
cause of a disputed vacancy in the editorship
of the Daily Bruin.
The Bruin staff and the publications board
have recommended one of the experienced
lews editors for the top position on the staff,
iowever, certain council members have
frowned because they disliked one editorial
//ritten by the leading candidate.
Here at Stanford, the editor is elected by the
staff—which after all has the best opportunity
to know a candidate's gualities—and Publica
lions Board and Excom approval are merely a
rubber stamp.
If an editor were disgualified at Stanford be
cause of an editorial opinion, one of the main
Dutlets for criticism and analysis of student
government would be blocked.
While we are on the general subject of the
press and public relations it seems appropriate
to commend the ASSU for considering the
creation of an office for a public relations co
ordinator.

Such a plan was presented to Excom last
week for future consideration. Integrating stu
dent body activities with The Daily and the
University Director of Information would be
only one of the functions of the new office.
Promotion campaigns, hospitality committee
activities, and survey committees might be in
cluded also.
Although many students are eager to work
on individual projects and committees, few
have the background for putting their program
over to the public. A competent public rela
tions co-ordinator might even provide the an
swer to charity drive and elections problems.
There's a spirit of friendly co-operation
among the three campus publications except
when they clash in athletic contests.
You will read in today's Chappie an account
of the Daily-Chappie football game held in the
Consolation Bowl. The gag mag's account of
the proceedings is faked. The legitimate game
played with a live referee was won by
the Daily, 14 to 6.
The post-game action, reported by the Chap
pie as the varsity game, took place at Rossotti's.
The 7-0 Chappie score came after seven passes
— seven Chappie men passed out. "
