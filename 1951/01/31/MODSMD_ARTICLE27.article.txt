# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
Ever drop in on an Excom meeting? They're always
good for laughs, but sometimes you can learn a lot, too.
They had one the other day to discuss this proposal
to send a delegate to the Home Peace Conference in
April. I was hanging around the Union hiding from

my books at the time, so 1 decided
to sit in at the meeting. It's warm
in the Excom room and the chairs
are comfortable.
The usual crowd was there —
student body officers, committee
members, interested and disinter
ested onlookers—all busy puffing,
cigarettes, putting them out, and
lighting new ones.

The talk started out the usuul way—the intense voices
of the speakers following one another in eager suc
cession, Buttner striving patiently to keep the discus
sion to the point, the argument jogging along back and
lorth, rising suddenly to a sharp, sarcastic pitch, and
then subsiding again in softer tones.
The question was whether the student body favored
sending a student delegate to this conference in Rome,
and whether Stanford would profit by doing so. Some
of the speakers seemed to know what they were talk
ing about, and there were good arguments on both
sides. ,
But what impressed me was the amount of work
with which these people had backed up their interest
in the proposal, either pro or con. The major partici
pants all had reams of material to which they referred
during the argument, coming up time and time again

with facts that spelled hours of research, and inter
viewing.
1 don't know . . . maybe this is all stupid naivete
on my part. Maybe you've known all along about all
the people there are on this campus working hard at
things that no one ever hears about. But like I say, j
I was impressed.
I couldn't say, furthermore, even after having at
tended the meeting, whether it would be a good idea
for Stanford to send the delegate or not. I'm not sure,
either, how much of a difference it would make, one
way or the other.
But I think I learned one thing for sure from that
meeting. And it was something no one said, or anyone
agreed on. Raflier, the scene tselj," kind of spoke its j
own piece to me. Because as I sat there and watched |
. . . listening to the Excom members debating the is- I
sue and the kid from the lIR office offering the services
of his organization, and the adamant onlooker passing
his evidence around the council table ... I suddenly
realized that, regardless of the outcome, it was all
worthwhile.
I admit it. I didn't know it before. I was one of the
wise guys who thought they sat around up there in
that Excom room for looks, or laughs, or so they'd get j
their picture in the Quad in the "notables" section.
Not that I'm convinced now that it'll all make his
tory. But at le;ist they were people interested enough j
in something to work ;it it and believe in it . . . some- j
thing, by the way. that might even, in time to come, do
a little good in the world.
And. brother, that's more than you and I are doing, i
Isn't it?
