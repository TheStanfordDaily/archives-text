# Newly-weds in Draft

WASHINGTON â€” Draft-age men
were warned today that a marriage
since the Korean war started is no
guarantee against induction into the
armed forces.
The statement was made by Se
lective Service officials as the De
fense Department rejected Congres
sional proposals to raise the top draft
age from 25 to 30 to avoid an imme
diate 18-year-old draft.
The warning that draft-age men
who have married since June 25,
1950, legally can be classified 1-A
and ordered into uniform followed
reports that some local boards across
the country already are taking such
action.
