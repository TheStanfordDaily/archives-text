# Pomeroy Receives Pop Warner Award
## 
### 
"Russ Pomeroy, an outstanding
football player and inspirational
leader" â€” these were the words of
Glenn S. "Pop" Warner as he pre
sented the Stanford co-captain and
tackle with the Warner Award for
being the outstanding football senior
on the Coast during 1950.
The presentation was made last
night at the PALO Club's fifth an
nual "Million Dollar" Banquet and
was aired across the nation over the
Liberty Broadcasting System.
The blond, 205-pound lineman re
ceived the award on the vote of 350
California spot tswriters.
Said Pomeroy, who received a
wrist watch in addition to the gold
football trophy, "This is really a great
honor and.l'd like to thank Mr. War
ner and all those who made it pos
sible."
Warner, a famous lineman himself
and coach of Carlisle and Stanford
went on to add that he thought it a
double honor for a tackle and defen
sive player to win the award over
a backfield man.
Other comments on Pomeroy were:
Coach Lynn Waldorf: "A very fine
football player and young man."
Ail-American Bill McColl: "We all
knew before the season started when
we elected Russ captain that he
would be the team's most valuable
player."
A senior and honor student in geol
ogy, Pomeroy will not go on into pro
fessional football. He was a unani
mous All-Coast selection and par
ticipated as a linebacker in the East-
West Shrine game.
