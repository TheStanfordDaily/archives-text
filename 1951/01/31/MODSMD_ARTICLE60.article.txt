# Kluga Wins In All-University Golf Tourney
## 
### 
Jibhn Kluga blasted out three
birdies yesterday afternoon to beat
Kappa Sig Keith Beekrnan two up
in the final round of the All-Univer
sity golf tournament.
Kluga, a graduate student who
won top honors in the same tourney
last year, got off to a fast start taking
the first three holes and maintianed
his lead with some classy putting.
After taking a birdie on the par
three fourteenth, Kluga played
steady golf and cinched the victory
after Beekman missed a four - foot
putt to split on the seventeenth.
The linksmen closed out the four
hour match by posting scores of 76
and 7!) respectively.
Beekman, whose putting was not
up to par all afternoon, has been
number one man on the golf ladder.
Although Kluga has never carried
the Cardinal colors as a playing
member of the team, he won a letter
last year as senior manager.
The tournament, which opened
last quarter, was open *to all stu
dents.
