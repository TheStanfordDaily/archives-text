# Stanford's Ruggers Meet Paly Ramblers
## 
### 
Stanford's 1951 rugby team, last
year's Pacific Const champions, will
officially begin their season next
Saturday on the varsity football
practice field against the Palo Alto
Ramblers.
The ruggers, minus the services
of ten of last year's first team, are
under a brand new coach. Pete
Kmetovic, who coached Stanford
backs last fall, i:s the man filling
Chuck Taylor's shoes. Here's the
way the team will probably line up
on Saturday.
The front rank will be filled by
Norm Manoogian, Dave Anderson,
and Jack Bonetti. Manoogian and
Bonetti, both varsity football guards,
will be counted on heavily. Manoo
gian was second string last year be
hind captain Mike Spiro. Bonetti
has never played rugby before.
Anderson Key Man
Dave Anderson, the third man in
the front rank, has lots of experience
and will be the key man in the
scrum.
A 1 Kirkland and Walt Watters will
man the second rank. Kirkland is a
transfer from USC where he played

freshman football. He was not eli
gible for football last fall but he
worked out with the Braves at de
j fensive end. Watters is a holdover
I from last year's team and will see
J plenty of action.
I Bub SCanley will be back again as
I IoL-k. He was first string last year,
has plenty of experience, and is re
garded as an excellent dribbler.
Rice and tone Start
j At the breakaway positions, Jesse
i Cone and Gordy Rice will probably
| be the starters. Both played varsity
football. Cone was a member of last
year's rugby team and will be one
of the key men. Rice, who suffered a
! broken leg in the 1949 Cal game, and
I did not play football last season, will
I be counted upon to supply power.
! Close behind him is Ron Eadie who
j was a defensive end on the 1950 foot
ball team. He lacks experience but
is coming along very fast and will
play quite a bit. #
In the backfield, Jim Bradshaw
I wiil man the all - important scrum
| half position. It was Bradshaw who
! scored a penalty kick in the closing
| seconds of last year's Cal game that
! enabled Stanford to win.
i First and second five will be filled
' by John Banks and Bill deYoung,
both ex-varsity gridders, and first
I string on hv. t year's rugby team.
Last year Banks made a.trip-to Eng
land and got a chance to thoroughly
| study the game.
Latham Is Outstanding
Russ Latham will be third five and
! probably the key man on this year's
! team. Latham played for British Co
lumbia last year and scored 14 out
of the 17 pr»>nts the Canadians scored
; against Stt nford in the second meet
ing. Latha n is an excellent kicker
and probah y one of the most out
• standing ruggers in America today.
The wings will be Joe St. Geme,
j first-string defensive grid back, and
j Sam Thornton who played rugby
j last year. At the fullback spot will
j be Vance Sheffey, who was injured
I last season. Vance is a fine punter
i and defensive star.
| Bill McColl. a star of last year's
' team, has been hampered by a cold
1 and probably won't start on Satur
; day. He is a fine long kicker and
1 runner and will see plenty of action.
| The schedule already made out
j includes two games with British
| Columbia and one with UCLA, Cal,
; the Olympic Club, Petaluma, the
j University Club, and the Palo Alto
| Ramblers.
