## 
### 
The Stanford varsby cage corps
will taper off this afternoon with a
light workout, following extensive
practice, sessions the last two eve
nings in preparation for tomorrow's
Pavilion battle against the Stewart
Chevrolets and a Saturday night
date with the Bradley Braves.
Tomorrow's affair, which will get
under way at 8 p.m., will be featured
by the first local appearance this
year of ex - Card George Yardley.
Jumping Jorge, the fair-haired boy
of the Stanford rooting section for
three seasons before his eligibility
ran out last year, is the leading scor
er of the Luisetti - coached AAU
team.
Last season Yardley surpassed
Luisetti's 11-year-old Southern Di
vision scoring mark, but finished
one point behind Trojan Bill Shar
man in the hottest, wildest individ
ual race in PCC annals.
Sharman finished the season (a
half-hour after Yardley) with a to
tal of 238 points. George had 237 as
against Luisetti's former record of
232.
Stanford coach Everett Dean has
termed the Chevs "one of the finest
collection of individual stars in this
part of the country." However. Dean
added hastily, "But we have more
speed. You can be sure they'll know
they've been in a ball game."
