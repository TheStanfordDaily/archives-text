# 'The Trial' Begins Run Tomorrow
## Tickets on Sale At Box Office 
### 
Good tickets for "The Trial,"
to be presented Feb. 1, 2, and 3
at the Memorial Auditorium, are
available for tomorrow night.
A report from the Mem Aud
box office said that tickets have been
selling "very well" and that choice
seats for Friday and Saturday per
formances are practically gone.
The play is a dramatization by
Andre Gide from Franz Kafka's
novel, published posthumously and
contrary to the author's explicit in
structions that it should be burned.
Three year's ago Gide's play was
produced in France and won wide
acclaim. Life magazine did a spread
on it, but the play h&s had no pro
fessional production in this country,
because of the high expense involved
in producing a 17-set play on the
professional stage.
Director F. Cowles Strickland was
already familiar with the script be
cause it had been sent to him with
the idea that he might dircct it in a
Broadway production, which never
materialized.
Long negotiations with theatrical
agents finally disclosed the fact that
the commercial rights to the psycho
logical melodrama are not held by
anyone; so amateur rights were
available, except that all the scripts
were lost.
Strickland, who had received
copies of the script, had been negli
gent in sending theirl back. So the
safe in the Stanford Players' office
holds two missing scripts.
Admission to the Stanford Players'
production may be purchased at the
Memorial Auditorium I.ox office for
90 cents. For reservations, call DA 3-
06(35.

Clancy in the leading role of Joseph K. is talking to the hunch
back bailiff, Homer T. Bower. The bailiff's laundress wife, The
resia Reimers, is being carried off by the student Ronald Hayes.
