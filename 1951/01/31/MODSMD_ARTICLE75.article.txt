# Singapore of 1946 Hid Four Years of Suffering
## Adversity Aids Unity 
### DAVID WONG 
As the M.V. Gordon docked
at Singapore in April,- 1946, I
stood on the promenade deck
wondering how much Malaya
had changed since I last saw it.
Only four years before, the
same ship had taken me out
of Singapore amid Japanese
bombs to the safety of Australia.
Superficially, except for a few
ruined buildings, things ap
peared much the same.
Singapore's polyglot population
was on hand to meet the ship; and I
once again heard the familiar mix
ture of English, Malay, Chinese, and
Tamil being spoken. The stifling
heat of the tropical sun together with
the gay, colorful Malayan sarongs
made me feel at home.
But actually things had changed.
The tanned faces of my friends ap
peared thinner, older, wiser. I lis
tened to their stories of the occupa
tion—the beriberi, the tortures, and
the guerrilla bands.
Other things had also changed.
Life brought more worries. Apart
from the complete disruption of the
country's economy, tuberculosis and
other diseases were more prevalent;
the price of food was 20 times higher

than pre - war, and robberies were
much more frequent.
But out of all that, some good
came. The adversity was welding
the Malayan people into a single
people, regardless of race, color, or
creed. Together they started on the
long road to rehabilitation and even
tual self-government.
When I left Malaya at the end of
the year, the futux-e looked promis
ing. The cost of living had gone
down somewhat, and the people
were returning to their normal
peaceful life.. As of old, they went

swimming in the clear waters of Pa-
I sir Panjan and held picnics beneath
i the leafy fingers of cocoanut palms,
j They dined and danced once more in
j the cozy half-light of Prince's and
, Raffle's. Tourists again invaded the
: cool heights of Cameron Highlands
I and the ancient temples of Pcnang.
But all hopes of recovery and sta
j bility were shattered when Commu-
I nist guerrillas started a campaign of
: violence and terrorism early in 1947.
They burned the rubber factories
and the tin - mining camps which
J formed the backbone of Malaya's
i economy.
| The battle against the Commu
; nists has gone on for four years, with
j as yet no end in sight. And all the
j time the economic situation steadily
grew worse, and the people plunged
| into new depths of despair.
Last week, in a letter to me, a Ma
layan educator wrote:
''Apart from the Communists, our
greatest problem is the inflation. The
rich are rolling in wealth, and the
poor are very poor and miserable.
Socialism can do a lot of good for us
here. I think that alone will save
! this country from Communism."


MOSQUE AT ALOR STAR—Such mosques abound in Malaya
for the Malays are Mohammedan in faith. However, Buddhist
shrines, Hindu temples, and Christian churches are found in
equal profusion for the rest of Malaya's mixed population.

Life brought more worries. Apart
from the complete disruption of the
country's economy, tuberculosis and
other diseases were more prevalent;
the price of food was 20 times higher

than pre - war, and robberies were
much more frequent.

came. The adversity was welding
the Malayan people into a single
people, regardless of race, color, or
creed. Together they started on the
long road to rehabilitation and even
tual self-government.

the year, the futux-e looked promis

As the M.V. Gordon docked
at Singapore in April,- 1946, I
stood on the promenade deck
wondering how much Malaya
had changed since I last saw it.
Only four years before, the
same ship had taken me out
of Singapore amid Japanese
bombs to the safety of Australia.
Superficially, except for a few
ruined buildings, things ap
peared much the same.
Singapore's polyglot population
was on hand to meet the ship; and I
once again heard the familiar mix
ture of English, Malay, Chinese, and
Tamil being spoken. The stifling
heat of the tropical sun together with
the gay, colorful Malayan sarongs
made me feel at home.
But actually things had changed.
The tanned faces of my friends ap
peared thinner, older, wiser. I lis
tened to their stories of the occupa
tion—the beriberi, the tortures, and
the guerrilla bands.
