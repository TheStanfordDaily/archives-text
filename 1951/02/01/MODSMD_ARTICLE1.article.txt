CHICAGO, Jan. 11l (UP) — A
spreading strike of railroad switch
men crippled freight, mail, and pas
senger service at key rail hubs from
coast to coast today and the De
fense Transportation Administration
ordered an embargo.
At least 35 railroads at more than
a dozen cities were hit by the walk

strategy of reporting "sick" that they
employed in a similar strike last
month.
Government attorneys here de
manded in federal court that a con
tempt citation be issued against the
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen

an injunction issued in the previous
strike.
