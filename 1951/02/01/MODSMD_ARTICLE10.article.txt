# Stanford Falls Six Short Of 200-Pint Blood Quota
## 
### 
One hundred ninety-four pints of blood were donated by Stan
ford students yesterday when the Red Cross conducted its first
drive on campus. The drive fell short of its 200-pint quota because
37 students were rejected for acute colds or physical reasons.
Of the 250 donors who signed up, only 17 failed to keep their

appointments. A few, who were un
able to come because of illness, sent
substitutes.
Of the 194 donors, 60 were veterans,
and seven of these had actually re
ceived plasma while in the last war.
Other donors included 26 members
of the NROTC unit, three from
ROTC, five from the Air ROTC, two
from the Navy and one from the
Army.
Mainly Students
Five foreign students and 86 wom
en were among the donors. There
were also a few donations from fac
ulty and staff members, hut this
drive was directed mainly toward
student recruiting. Two sets of hus
bands and wives donated together.
The unit arrived at the Women's
Clubhouse about 8 a.m. and set up
12 beds and all their equipment in
an hour. A doctor and 12 nurses
came with the unit. The Palo Alto
Red Cross chapter furnished about
30 volunteers, and seven Stanford
women assisted as Junior Gray La
dies. ,
When students appeared for their
appointments, Gray Ladies greeted
them, and ushered them to the ap
pointment desk, where they were
checked off and sent into the lounge.
There, staff aides registered them on
permanent record cards. Then nurses
took their temperatures, blood pres
sures, and weight; gave them a
hemoglobin test; typed their blood;
and checked their medical histories.
From there, they went to beds pre
paratory to blood donation.
Coffee and Doughnuts
After relaxing for a few minutes,
donors were served coflee and
doughnuts by aides at the canteen.
When they left, they received a blood
donor pin and also signed the Red
Cross roll of honor as blood donors.
A certificate with blood type and
notices of positive or negative Rh
factor will be mailed to each one
later.

One hundred ninety-four pints of blood were donated by Stan
ford students yesterday when the Red Cross conducted its first
drive on campus. The drive fell short of its 200-pint quota because
37 students were rejected for acute colds or physical reasons.
Of the 250 donors who signed up, only 17 failed to keep their

appointments. A few, who were un
able to come because of illness, sent
substitutes.
Of the 194 donors, 60 were veterans,
and seven of these had actually re
ceived plasma while in the last war.
Other donors included 26 members
of the NROTC unit, three from
ROTC, five from the Air ROTC, two
from the Navy and one from the
Army.
Mainly Students
Five foreign students and 86 wom
en were among the donors. There
were also a few donations from fac
ulty and staff members, hut this
drive was directed mainly toward
student recruiting. Two sets of hus
bands and wives donated together.
The unit arrived at the Women's
Clubhouse about 8 a.m. and set up
12 beds and all their equipment in
an hour. A doctor and 12 nurses
came with the unit. The Palo Alto
Red Cross chapter furnished about
30 volunteers, and seven Stanford
women assisted as Junior Gray La
dies. ,
When students appeared for their
appointments, Gray Ladies greeted
them, and ushered them to the ap
pointment desk, where they were
checked off and sent into the lounge.
There, staff aides registered them on
permanent record cards. Then nurses
took their temperatures, blood pres
sures, and weight; gave them a
hemoglobin test; typed their blood;
and checked their medical histories.
From there, they went to beds pre
paratory to blood donation.
Coffee and Doughnuts
After relaxing for a few minutes,
donors were served coflee and
doughnuts by aides at the canteen.
When they left, they received a blood
donor pin and also signed the Red
Cross roll of honor as blood donors.
A certificate with blood type and
notices of positive or negative Rh
factor will be mailed to each one
later.
