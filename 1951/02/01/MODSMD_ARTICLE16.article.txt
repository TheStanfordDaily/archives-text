# Farm Civilian Defense Program Moves Ahead
## Mock Assault Operation Is Set for Feb. 
### 
Stanford's three military re
serve arms — ROTC, NROTC,
and Air ROTC—will go into ac
tion to assist the police, fire,
and public utilities divisions of
the Farm's Civilian Defense pro
gram, in that order, in the event
of a disaster here, University
Business Manager Alf Brandin
revealed yesterday.
Brandin also announced the ap
pointment of Capt. Lloyd W. Goep
pert, Stanford ROTC instructor, to
the position of liaison officer between
the Stanford Civil Defense program
and its military reserve contingent.
Capt. Gocppert will also coordinate
the activities of the six divisions on
campus—fire, police, public utilities,
medical, housing, and feeding—from
a control center in the local Fire
house. He will be in communication
with county-wide and state-wide di
rectives in the event of an emergency.
Following a meeting yesterday
afternoon between Brandin and the
six division heads, the business man
ager announced that "the organiza
tion of each separate unit is complete
and the requisite positions filled."
Follow-up Work
Follow-up work, Brandin said, will
consist of "indoctrination" and "co
ordination between the divisions,"
and will take place in February.
Within the next 10 days, he said, a
joint meeting of all personnel con
cerned with Civilian Defense will be
held. At that time, he said, directors
will explain "the overall picture," in
cluding Stanford's obligation to the
county, state, and federal govern
ment.
The following week, Brandin
stated, each division will carry out a
"dry run" to test operations under
simulated disaster conditions.
"Dry Run"
Finally, during the last week in J
February, an overall "dry run" will
be staged to determine the effective
ness of the six divisions—plus the
control center—working as a group
to neutralize the effects of an attack.
Brandin estimated that between
300 and 500 people make up the
campus Civil Defense force and will i
be involved in the mock assault.
He said the three military units,
consisting of students enrolled in re
serve programs here, will assemble
in one place yet undetermined)
in the event of a warning signal, and
await instructions from Capt. Gocp
pert. Students may be called to fight
fires, direct traffic, fill in bomb
craters and the like, Brandin indi
cated.
Remaining Divisions
The decision to strengthen the Ci
vilian Defense program with the al
ready-organized reserve units came
as a form of relief to Chiefs Gordon
Davis and John Marston of the Police
and Fire divisions, insofar as they
had reported "trouble" in recruiting
student help to do the job.
Heading the l'emaining divisions
are Dr. George Houck (Medical),
•Carroll Blacker (public utilities),
Miss Anastasia Doyle (housing), Miss
Cristine Ricker (feeding), and Philip
Duffy (control center).


CAUGHT IN THE ACT—Peeking around the corner at an oppor
tune time is landlady, Mrs. Gruback, played by Janet Kara
hadian. Caught in en embrace are lames Clancy, star of "The
Trial," and Jean Leonard as Miss Burstner. The melodrama
opens tonight at 8:15.

Stanford's three military re
serve arms — ROTC, NROTC,
and Air ROTC—will go into ac
tion to assist the police, fire,
and public utilities divisions of
the Farm's Civilian Defense pro
gram, in that order, in the event
of a disaster here, University
Business Manager Alf Brandin
revealed yesterday.
Brandin also announced the ap
pointment of Capt. Lloyd W. Goep
pert, Stanford ROTC instructor, to
the position of liaison officer between
the Stanford Civil Defense program
and its military reserve contingent.
Capt. Gocppert will also coordinate
the activities of the six divisions on
campus—fire, police, public utilities,
medical, housing, and feeding—from
a control center in the local Fire
house. He will be in communication
with county-wide and state-wide di
rectives in the event of an emergency.
Following a meeting yesterday
afternoon between Brandin and the
six division heads, the business man
ager announced that "the organiza
tion of each separate unit is complete
and the requisite positions filled."
Follow-up Work
Follow-up work, Brandin said, will
consist of "indoctrination" and "co
ordination between the divisions,"
and will take place in February.
Within the next 10 days, he said, a
joint meeting of all personnel con
cerned with Civilian Defense will be
held. At that time, he said, directors
will explain "the overall picture," in
cluding Stanford's obligation to the
county, state, and federal govern
ment.
The following week, Brandin
stated, each division will carry out a
"dry run" to test operations under
simulated disaster conditions.
"Dry Run"
Finally, during the last week in J
February, an overall "dry run" will
be staged to determine the effective
ness of the six divisions—plus the
control center—working as a group
to neutralize the effects of an attack.
Brandin estimated that between
300 and 500 people make up the
campus Civil Defense force and will i
be involved in the mock assault.
He said the three military units,
consisting of students enrolled in re
serve programs here, will assemble
in one place yet undetermined)
in the event of a warning signal, and
await instructions from Capt. Gocp
pert. Students may be called to fight
fires, direct traffic, fill in bomb
craters and the like, Brandin indi
cated.
Remaining Divisions
The decision to strengthen the Ci
vilian Defense program with the al
ready-organized reserve units came
as a form of relief to Chiefs Gordon
Davis and John Marston of the Police
and Fire divisions, insofar as they
had reported "trouble" in recruiting
student help to do the job.
