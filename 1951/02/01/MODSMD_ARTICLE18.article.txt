# INFLATION
## Mobilization Economy Plan Devised Here 
### 
A new plan devised by Stanford
economists to prevent inflation in a
wartime mobilizing economy was
outlined yesterday by Professor Ti
bor Scitovsky, in a lecture to the
public on "Economic Problems of
Mobilization."
"Our present economy needs a
mobilization policy surpassing ortho
dox economic policies used during
World War II," Professor Scitovsky
said. To produce as large a national
product as possible for military con
sumption and maintain an equitable
distribution of civilian output, great
er strength in economic controls is
necessary, he said.
However, today, he said, mobiliza
tion promises to continue much
longer, ihe people are less willing to
save and rationing may cause infla
tion and black market operations.
High taxation, as was practiced in
Britain during the last war. he con
tinued, is liable to destroy incentive.
To meet this problem of reducing
consumer expenditures during war
time. Stanford economists have de
vised an alternative scheme which
includes:
1. Expenditure rationing, ba:-ed on
individual family income. Each fam
ily would be rationed according to
the amount of money it spent, rather
than the amount of commodities it
bought. The free price system would
be retained.
2. Issuing of savings bonds with
out accumulated interest. Consum
ers would be urged to invest in
bonds which, at the end of mobiliza
tion, would return the original cost
plus an additional sum to be deter
mined by the economic situation at
