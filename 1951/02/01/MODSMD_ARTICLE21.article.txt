# MY PRIVATE LIFE
## 
### PVT. BILL DAILEY 
(Editor's Note.—The following is former Bull Ses
sions Kill Ilailey's third column on army life at
Fort Ord. near Monterey, Calif.)
For some unknown reason I seem to have a lew
spare minute.; tonight before lights out. so perhaps
•his is a good time to scribble out a few lines for the
(Stanford Gang.
The main stimulus for my knoeking out this article

vonight is to pass on the bunch at
he Farm the rapidly growing
lumber of Stanfordites who are
. urning up here at beautiful,
:,cenic, picturesque (all right,
laarge, let go of my arm!) Fort
Ord.
In the three week I've been here
have seen no less than 10 men
",vho attended Stanford during this
ast year. Included in this happy
•roup are Bob Crozier and Gene

\yer (Sigma Chi), and Dave Lamson and Jim Watkin
!.on from the DU House. Also on deck are Skip
Athearn and Jack Voodt of Theta Xi, Fiji Pete Willett,
Mm Kurfess from the Delta Chi House, Pat Ryan from
.he Speech and Drama Department, and Dan Stone,
of Stern Hall. These are fellows whom I have actually
seen. There are undoubtedly many more Stanford
":ioys (soon to be men) running around this glorious
spot.
Aside from that warm glow (no, not alcohol.
Mother) which I got when I ran into the above-named
Stanfordites, the most interesting part of this basic
'raining thus far has been the fun I've had getting to
know the wide assortment of characters who share a
cozy 50-bed suite with me.
And when I say "characters" that's exactly what

I mean. The range in intelligence and education in
my barracks runs all the way from one boy* who
spells "each other"—"eechother" (0.k., Dailey, quit
looking over his shoulder when he's writing his
girl), to a civil engineer from Yale.
We've a young Negro Baptist minister, a Nevada
rancher who gets letters from his common-law wife,
a conscientious objector who carries no rifle, and a
former bass player with Dave Brubeck's combo. Yes- I
ser. quite a bunch.
As far as the training itself is concerned, it is still
the same old Army, the M-l rifle is still your best j
friend, the haircuts are short, the V-D lectures are i
hilarious, the KP is 16 hours at a stretch, and the day
starts at 4:30 a.m.
That last one is the killer. You boys who have
trouble making your 11 o'clock classes will really
love that 4:30 reveille. Actually it isn't too bad. At
times it's funny as hell. If it Were not for the un
pleasant possibility that you might be shipped to
Korea at the end of basic training, the whole thing
wouldn't be too hard to take.
Next time I get a chance to write, I will try to in
clude a detailed outline of the type of training we are j
actually getting. In the meanwhile, if any of you fel- !
lows have any questions about the Army that a rough
old three-week man like yours truly could answer,
drop me a line and I'll be glad to try.
For that matter, the word from any of my cronies
would be a very welcome addition to my private
life. The address is Pvt. William Dailey, U.S.
56053691, Co. 11., 63rd Inf. Keg., Fort Ord. Calif.
Time to hit the sack (that's Army talk, men, heh!).
There's just time enough left before lights out to say
a short prayer for a 36-hour pass this weekend. I
wonder how long it will take me to get from Fort Ord
to Lagunita Court?
