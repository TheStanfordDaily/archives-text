## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Picture a sidewalk cafe in ihe
Latin Quarter where students
areiseated in small groups dis
cussing the problems of life
ever a cup of coffee.
The street is probably "Boul Mich"
( boulevard St. Michel), focal point
0 student life in Paris, Jeanne Marie
\ illru' explains. Although there is no
c mpus, and hence no campus life as
v e know it in the United States, stu
<'• nts are bound together by these
d uly meetings at the cafe.
In one group are the political sci
nce majors hushing over France's
uresent diplomatic policy: in an
ither are the art majors discussing
he merits of a current exhibition.
Their conversation is usually a car
ry-over from the previous class or
a heated opinion on the day's news.
Jeanne Marie, a vivacious and
1 :irk - haired French foreign schol
; snhip student doing graduate work
i 1 political science at Stanford, said
l rot since the war a strong interna
t onal feeling has been growing
; mong the students. In their discus
f onfc they express a fervent hope for
lutoipean reconstruction and unity.
"The students want to see a
United Europe first, as a healthy
basis for an eventual world
government," Jeanne Marie ex
plained.
Jctinne Marie said that in these
: tudjfnt-filled cafes you can find ev
«ly type of individual. One of the
leasflns why students from all over
the world come to study in Paris is
ihe .intellectual stimulation arising
t . orrr these informal discussions.
Frt'nch students are particularly
• ttracted to Paris because there they
i an find social and intellectual free
dom, which is more rigidly con
trolled in their homes.
I it French society young girls
are limited to friendships within
their own family's acquaintances.
Hut at the university. Jeanne Ma
rie explained, there are no social
ranks and students choose their
friends on an individual basis.
Jeanne Marie points out (hat stu

dent life is more tense on an intel
lectual plane than in the United
States — there is an intense desire
for learning and an acute awareness
of Europe's present problems.
But the scene of these intellec
tual confabs, the Latin Quarter, is
always full of life and student an
tics are a common occurrence. One
is the "monomc." in which stu
dents from one of the graduate
schools form a huge serpentine
and whirl through the streets,
circling around an innocent pe
destrian until he removes his hat,
or a pretty girl until she parts with
a kiss. ,
At the Institut des Etudes Poli
tiques in Paris, where she was grad
uated last year. Jeanne Marie was a
member of an organization which
aims at furthering international un
derstanding through personal con

tacts with foreign students. During
the school year the organization en
gages in current political studies.
In the summer this French
group plays host to students from
various countries at a castle which
they own, located on a small is
land in the Mediterranean. There
the students combine studying
with fishing and swimming — and
most important. Jeanne Marie
points out, "we learn a great deal
about our respective countries
through each other."
The French students were, in turn,
invited to spend their Christmas and
spring vacations in Germany and
Italy.
Jeanne Marie, who lives at Du
rand, is working toward a diplo
matic career and hopes to visit Ger
many and other countries on her re
turn to Paris.
