# Reds Not Behind Attack On Truman, Says Report
## 
### 
Were Communists behind last October's attempt on President
Truman's life?
It does not look that way, according to an* authoritative report
just published.
The Hispanic American Report, monthly publication now in its

fourth year as a production of Stan
ford University's Hispanic World Af
fairs Seminar, said in its January is
sue:
"One is unable to find in the lists .
of the accused the name of any
known main Communist leader in
Puerto Rico."
The report declared rather that the I
real responsibility rests with the Na
tionalist Party of Puerto Rico whose
leaders face trial for attempted vio
lent overthrow of the government,
and some of whom face murder
charges.
The Communst Party, with barely
500 members, "lacks good leadership
and propaganda" and "their political
influence so far has been negligible," I
the Report continued.
"In the last 20 years," the Report
said, the Nationalists meanwhile
"have resorted to political assassina
tions several times in an effort to em- j
barrass insular and American gov
ernments and to arouse public opin
ion throughout the world and in
Latin America particularly to see the |
plight of Puerto Rico 'under the
chains of U.S. imperialism'."
The report is based on a study of
publications throughout the Hispanic
world, interviews with informants J
recently returned from the area and '

on correspondence with observers
throughout the Spanish- and Portu
guese-speaking world.
The University of Liverpool Bulle
tin of Hispanic Studies recently re
ported. "To all interested in Hispanic
politics, this unique publication is
indispensable.''
