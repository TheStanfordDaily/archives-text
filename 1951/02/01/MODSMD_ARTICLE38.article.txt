### 
An exhibit of Watercolor paintings '
of Paris and the French Riviera by i
Professor Daniel Mendelowitz, many
| of them being shown for the first j
time, is now on display in the Stan
ford Art Gallery.
The paintings were done last year
by the Stanford Art Department
professor during a sabbatical leave
spent in Europe. They range in sub
ject from classical buildings and
bridges of Paris to the rubble of war >
ruins in the French countryside.
Many of the paintings were exhib- j
itecl at the Kenneth Slaughter Gal
leries in San Francisco last fall, but
most have not yet been shown to the
public.
The foyer of the Stanford Gallery
has a display of paintings in gouache
—opaque watercolors—by Paul Ter
rence Feeley, a professor at Ben
nington College, Bennington, Vt.,
now spending a leave on the Monte
rey Peninsula.
* The gallery .is also showing a col
lection of T'ang and Sung dynasty
i porcelains and art pieces representa
tive of the Middle Ages.
The gallery is open to the public
without charge Tuesday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
on Sunday from 12 noon to 4 p.m.
