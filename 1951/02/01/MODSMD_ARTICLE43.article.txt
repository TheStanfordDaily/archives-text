# PETE GROTHE
## Punts and Pitches Everyone Wants It, So Let's Renew The Annual Gurls' Grid Game 
### 
Load my double-barreled shotgun, Maw, this morning I'm on a crusade.
I'm on a crusade for what could be the most exciting event since the
Encina 2E boys locked a cop in the head last year. Or since the ratio
dropped from 3 to 1 to 2.6 to 1. Or since Donald E. sponsored a meeting.
Yes, it could be nothing but the annual Freshman Gurls vs. Sophomore
Gurls Football Game. "Annual," Until last year, that is—until someone
muttered something about "Stanford Tradition" or "not in keeping with
the dignity of the Stanford women" or some such excuse, and the game
was junked.
"Who wants the game?" cries a voice from the gallery. We've made exten
sive inquiries about this event that used to be part of the Frosh-Soph
Jamboree, and everyone wants it. The lemmes in the pictures below want
it. Women want it. Everyone wants it. So, let's have it.
But htjre comes that voice from the gallery again: "Okay, so everyone

does want the game, but won't the Administration object, because it's not
in keeping with 'Stanford Tradition'?"
We realize that the Administration, more specifically the women's coun
selor and Women's Physical Education Department, have to weigh the mat
ter seriously, but we fail to see how "Stanford Tradition" can be a pitfall.
We are among the first to revere traditions here on the Farm, but when
traditions are sanctified to the extent that they prevent good, honest fun,
then it's time to re-define those traditions. It would be a game that would
provide enjoyment for all (3.000 watched it in 1949. whereas only I! 00 watched
the boys' game), and it wouldn't injure anyone's reputation.
Ah, but the voice in the gallery again: "What about the girls getting
injured?"
The chances of that are very remote in a touch-tackle rather than a
tackle game. We maintain that the girls are more interested keeping their
mascara intact and their fingernails unbroken than they are racking up

touchdowns. A black eye on a girl on a Saturday night date doesn't look
too appealing, whereas a scratch or two will distinguish the countenance
of a male footballer. Battle-scars glamorize the menfolks. Not so with the
femmes.
Also, we might compare the game to skiing. The neophyte skier rarely
injures himself, because he knows his limits and takes it easy. We believe
the amateurish girls would also take it easy.
If the University can take the risk of 75 brutish footballers banging skulls
every day for three months, it can take the risk of 22 females playing touch
tackle for one hour.
But the voice in the gallery has one more thing to say: "Okay, so you
have the game, but I bet the girls won't be cute."
Not cute? Look at the pictures! With these gurls playing, the centers
will be the centers of attraction! The guards will be worth guarding! The
game will have many angles. And the pass receivers will be plenty expe
rienced. So we .say. let's have the game. Everyone wants it, it won't iniufe
anyone's reputation, and no one will get hurt.
So if we do have the game, let's everyone jump for joy! Let's get in prac
tice now. Everybody ready? All right, one, two. three, all together now,
JUMP!!!

WE'VE GOT ALL THE ANGLES—So say the sturdy sophs, as
they get into battle position Making up the All-Star contingent
are Diana Huston, left end; Julie Holway, left tackle; Marilyn
Hand, left guard; Jill Nisbet, center; Marilyn Kay, right guard;
Jane Draper, right tackle; and Jeanne Fox, right end. The deter

Pictured here are: Virginia Burns, left end; Anna Kovaleff, left

selor and Women's Physical Education Department, have to weigh the mat
ter seriously, but we fail to see how "Stanford Tradition" can be a pitfall.
We are among the first to revere traditions here on the Farm, but when
traditions are sanctified to the extent that they prevent good, honest fun,
then it's time to re-define those traditions. It would be a game that would
provide enjoyment for all (3.000 watched it in 1949. whereas only I! 00 watched
the boys' game), and it wouldn't injure anyone's reputation.
Ah, but the voice in the gallery again: "What about the girls getting
injured?"
The chances of that are very remote in a touch-tackle rather than a
tackle game. We maintain that the girls are more interested keeping their
mascara intact and their fingernails unbroken than they are racking up

touchdowns. A black eye on a girl on a Saturday night date doesn't look
too appealing, whereas a scratch or two will distinguish the countenance
of a male footballer. Battle-scars glamorize the menfolks. Not so with the
femmes.
Also, we might compare the game to skiing. The neophyte skier rarely
injures himself, because he knows his limits and takes it easy. We believe
the amateurish girls would also take it easy.
If the University can take the risk of 75 brutish footballers banging skulls
every day for three months, it can take the risk of 22 females playing touch
tackle for one hour.
But the voice in the gallery has one more thing to say: "Okay, so you
have the game, but I bet the girls won't be cute."
Not cute? Look at the pictures! With these gurls playing, the centers
will be the centers of attraction! The guards will be worth guarding! The
game will have many angles. And the pass receivers will be plenty expe
rienced. So we .say. let's have the game. Everyone wants it, it won't iniufe
anyone's reputation, and no one will get hurt.
So if we do have the game, let's everyone jump for joy! Let's get in prac
tice now. Everybody ready? All right, one, two. three, all together now,
JUMP!!!

WE'VE GOT ALL THE ANGLES—So say the sturdy sophs, as
they get into battle position Making up the All-Star contingent
are Diana Huston, left end; Julie Holway, left tackle; Marilyn
Hand, left guard; Jill Nisbet, center; Marilyn Kay, right guard;
Jane Draper, right tackle; and Jeanne Fox, right end. The deter
mined-looking backfield is: Jean French, left half; Cinnie Bar
rick, fullback; Joyce Engblom, quarterback; and Mary Sievers,
right half.


CRRRRRR—The freshman femmes are lined up and ready to go!
Pictured here are: Virginia Burns, left end; Anna Kovaleff, left
tackle; Berneice Achenbach, left guard; Nancie Brown, center;
Reva Berger, right guard; Mary Bladholm, left tackle; and Marty
Lewis, left end. The fearsome foursome in the backfield are
(from left to right): Monica Verdurmen, left half; Marlene Bogel,
fullback; Chloe Nye, guarterback; and Pat Sumner, right half.
Load my double-barreled shotgun, Maw, this morning I'm on a crusade.
I'm on a crusade for what could be the most exciting event since the
Encina 2E boys locked a cop in the head last year. Or since the ratio
dropped from 3 to 1 to 2.6 to 1. Or since Donald E. sponsored a meeting.
Yes, it could be nothing but the annual Freshman Gurls vs. Sophomore
Gurls Football Game. "Annual," Until last year, that is—until someone
muttered something about "Stanford Tradition" or "not in keeping with
the dignity of the Stanford women" or some such excuse, and the game
was junked.
"Who wants the game?" cries a voice from the gallery. We've made exten
sive inquiries about this event that used to be part of the Frosh-Soph
Jamboree, and everyone wants it. The lemmes in the pictures below want
it. Women want it. Everyone wants it. So, let's have it.
But htjre comes that voice from the gallery again: "Okay, so everyone

does want the game, but won't the Administration object, because it's not
in keeping with 'Stanford Tradition'?"
We realize that the Administration, more specifically the women's coun
selor and Women's Physical Education Department, have to weigh the mat
ter seriously, but we fail to see how "Stanford Tradition" can be a pitfall.

every day for three months, it can take the risk of 22 females playing touch
tackle for one hour.
But the voice in the gallery has one more thing to say: "Okay, so you
have the game, but I bet the girls won't be cute."
Not cute? Look at the pictures! With these gurls playing, the centers
will be the centers of attraction! The guards will be worth guarding! The
game will have many angles. And the pass receivers will be plenty expe
rienced. So we .say. let's have the game. Everyone wants it, it won't iniufe
anyone's reputation, and no one will get hurt.
So if we do have the game, let's everyone jump for joy! Let's get in prac
tice now. Everybody ready? All right, one, two. three, all together now,
JUMP!!!
