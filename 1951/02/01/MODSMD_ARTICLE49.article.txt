### IRWIN JOHNSON 
The University of Texas Long
horns will meet the Stanford
swimming team in a dual meet to
morrow afternoon at 3:30 in the
Encina Pools.
It will be the wintlup of a Texas
barnstorming tour, and the fourth
meet in five days for the Long
horns. Texas is bringing in a 12-
man traveling squad tonight, led
Ly Eddie Gilbert and Skippy
Browning.
(ail Gallops
Gilbert, who swam freestyle on
the '-18 Olympic team, will prob
ably swim the 220- and 100-yard
freestyle races. Early this week,
against a group of Southern Cali
fornia high school boys, Gilbert
did 2:12 for the 220, and 53.7 for
the 100.
Swimming against him in the
furlong will be soph Bert Holiday
and junior Pete Cole for the In
dians. Holiday has been burning
up the pool in practice in the last
week; Tuesday afternoon he went
1:5!).8 for 200 yards.
According to Coach Tom Hay
nie, a swimmer in top shape usu
ally finishes the last 20 yards in 13
seconds or under. This would have
Holiday doing the equivalent of
: 12.8. With a good possibility of
Holiday getting inspired for the
race against Gilbert, spectators
are in for a great race.
Third-Place Battle
Cole and Texas' Wynant Wilson
will be fighting for the third-place
spot, in all probability. Cole, who

was third in the NCAA 1,500-me
ter freestyle last year, should be
able to take the Lone Star junior.
Usually the best event from the
spectators' standpoint, the diving
has the added attraction of the na
tion's best collegiate diver, Texas'
Browning.
The small junior, who was sec
ond to Bruce Harlan in the NCAA
meet last year, is the odds-on fa
vorite to beat out Bill Glathe,
Stanford junior. Glathe, who was
an ineligible transfer last year, is
being coached by Harlan, and is
iust about assured of second place
in this event.
