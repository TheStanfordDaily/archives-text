# Red Line Stiffens

TOKYO, Thursday, Feb. 1 (UP)â€”
The U.S. Eighth Army battled today
to get its West Korean offensive roll
ing again in the face of Chinese re
sistance stiffened by thousands of
reinforcements fresh from Manchu
ria.
The American First and Ninth
Corps, including troops of 10 nations,
hacked out small gains in furious
fighting at some points along the 50-
mile front below Seoul yesterday.
But the Chinese checked the week
old push nearly everywhere.
