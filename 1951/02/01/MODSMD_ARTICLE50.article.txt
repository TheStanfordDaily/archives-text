# Cards Meet Chevvies In Pavilion Go Tonight
## BRADLEY SATURDAY Ex-Indian Stars to Return With Powerful AAU Squad 
### 
The two top scorers of Stanford basketball history will returr
to the Pavilion this evening when the Stewart Chevvies of Sar
Francisco clash with the Stanford varsity cagers.
One of the duo, legendary Hank Luisetti, is coach of the National
Industrial League contender. The second, George Yardley, is

currently Hank's leading pointmak
er on the Stewart squad.
Little will be at stake in the mid
week clash, but a packed house is
expected to greet the 8 p.m. tipoflf. !
Yardley's appearance is the major
factor behind the local interest in the
contest; but the Chewy roster in- i

The Stanford freshmen will play
the St. Mary's frosh at 6:15 tonight j
in a preliminary to the Varsity -
Stewart main event.

eludes a host of individual stars
stars whose names contribute great
ly to the attractiveness of the occa
sion.
For one, the fans will see Frank
Kuzara, the former USF Don who
has been one of the hottest per
formers in the fast AAU circuit the
past few weeks.
A member of the Hilltopper squad
which won the coveted National In
vitational crown in 1049, Frank spe
cializes in a long two-handed set
shot, though he's also n ball-han
dler and hustler in the best USF tra
dition.
Another Stewart crowd pleaser is
Cliff Crnndall, ex - Oregon great.
Crandall the Cat is the backbone of
the Chewy defense and a ball-han
dling magician on offense.
Last year's Cal pivotman, now
with with Luisetti's crew, Don Hen
drickson is also a well-known item
to local fans.
Card mentor Everett Dean plans
to counterbalance this impressive
array of Stewart talent with a speed
attack featuring the Indians' new
found firehouse fast break. If the
locals are to master the talented city
five, Dean reasons wisely, they must
rely on superior speed and condi
tion.
Dean will open with the same
five that have started for Stanford
all year. That means that Ed
Tuckev and captain Jack O'Stilli
van will be at forwards: Jim Ram
stead will get the pivot call: and
Hrucc Ivevsen and Jim Walsh will
open at guard.
The long - shot artistry displayed

by Walsh in the Indians' last outing
against USF. if continued in future
games, could provide the Cards with
a welcome addition to their not-too
varied attack. With Walsh continu
ing to hit long, the close-in work of
Tucker, Eamstead, and O'Sullivan
would also be considerably more ef
fective than in games past.
Walsh, incidentally, replaced Jim
Ramstead as the team's leading scor
er by dint of his 23 - point effort
against the Dons. Walsh has 219
points in 16 games, one point ahead
of Ramstead. Ed Tucker continues
to boast the highest average per
game, however, with 203 points for
12 games, an average of 17 per show
ing.
In spite of the caliber of their foes
tonight, the Card cagers presum
ably regard the Pavilion exercise as
a warmup for Saturday night's Cow
Palace intersectioanl against Brad
ley University's Braves.
A win over the Braves would
provide a considerable boost in
the Indians' national stature, and
that's the game they've been
thinking about in practice this
week.

stars whose names contribute great
ly to the attractiveness of the occa
sion.
For one, the fans will see Frank
Kuzara, the former USF Don who
has been one of the hottest per
formers in the fast AAU circuit the
past few weeks.
A member of the Hilltopper squad
which won the coveted National In
vitational crown in 1049, Frank spe
cializes in a long two-handed set
shot, though he's also n ball-han
dler and hustler in the best USF tra
dition.
Another Stewart crowd pleaser is
Cliff Crnndall, ex - Oregon great.
Crandall the Cat is the backbone of
the Chewy defense and a ball-han
dling magician on offense.
Last year's Cal pivotman, now
with with Luisetti's crew, Don Hen
drickson is also a well-known item
to local fans.
Card mentor Everett Dean plans
to counterbalance this impressive
array of Stewart talent with a speed
attack featuring the Indians' new
found firehouse fast break. If the
locals are to master the talented city
five, Dean reasons wisely, they must
rely on superior speed and condi
tion.
Dean will open with the same
five that have started for Stanford
all year. That means that Ed
Tuckev and captain Jack O'Stilli
van will be at forwards: Jim Ram
stead will get the pivot call: and
Hrucc Ivevsen and Jim Walsh will
open at guard.
The long - shot artistry displayed

by Walsh in the Indians' last outing
against USF. if continued in future
games, could provide the Cards with
a welcome addition to their not-too
varied attack. With Walsh continu
ing to hit long, the close-in work of
Tucker, Eamstead, and O'Sullivan
would also be considerably more ef
fective than in games past.
Walsh, incidentally, replaced Jim
Ramstead as the team's leading scor
er by dint of his 23 - point effort
against the Dons. Walsh has 219
points in 16 games, one point ahead
of Ramstead. Ed Tucker continues
to boast the highest average per
game, however, with 203 points for
12 games, an average of 17 per show
ing.
In spite of the caliber of their foes
tonight, the Card cagers presum
ably regard the Pavilion exercise as
a warmup for Saturday night's Cow
Palace intersectioanl against Brad
ley University's Braves.
A win over the Braves would
provide a considerable boost in
the Indians' national stature, and
that's the game they've been
thinking about in practice this
week.
