# Rome Delegate Refused
## 8 to 6 Vote By Excom Is Clincher 
### 
After nearly two hours of de
bate last night, Excom voted, 8
to 6, not to send an official dele- i
gate to the Rome Congress. The
dissenters — Excom representa
tives Carol Penney, Dorothy
Thomas, Phil Saeta, Gil Jonas,
Dick O'Connell, and Chuck Sil
verberg—who wished to send a
delegate, lost by two votes.
Excom then passed a motion by
Dorothy Thomas to investigate the
possibility of sending an unofficial
observer to the Congress. The mo
tion was passed 13 to 1, with Bill
Bcthke, men's row, dissenting. Pre
sumably this observer would be a
former Stanford student already in
Europe or a qualified Stanford stu
dent who would travel at his own ex
pense.
Most of the debate on the Rome
Congress, which will be held April
2 to 9, was concerned with its value
to the average Stanford student.
Harry Rowe, graduate Excom
representative, said that a Stanford
representative wouldn't contact the
majority of representatives and
would probably be relegated to com
mittee work and learn little he could
report back.
Dorothy Thomas, women's halls,
said that a "lot of misunderstand
ing, internationally speaking, can
come from people who go over to
Europe for only five days."
Phil Saeta, men's halls, added that
a movement like this was good, but
its real value came only if students
would go to hear the delegate speak
when he returned. Saeta doubted
that enough students would hear the
delegate to justify "the excessive
cost" involved.
Gil Jonas answered Saeta by saying
that only a small percentage of the
student body would go to the Louis
Armstrong dance, yet we should have
dances as functions.
'•That's entirely different," Bill
Fundenberg, freshman representa
tive said. "I wouldn't go to hear
Louis Armstrong because I don't
have $2>40 and I can't dance to his
kind of music." Then he added that
he was in favor of holding a dance
anyway and so arc the other non
daijcing members of the ASSU.
A foreign woman student from
Czechoslovakia, who refused to give
her name for publication, said that
Stanford should consider other things
besides the advantage to Stanford
students. "A Stanford delegate at
this conference would be a person
ality," she said and would give Eu
ropean students help, would show
them America is interested in them.
Bill Jarvis, another interested stu
dent, stated, that we would prove
ourselves in favor of world govern
ment if we sent a delegate.
Five or six Excom members re
minded him that many groups op
posed to world government—includ
ing the Atlantic Union and the state
of Tennessee—would be represent
ed.
Bill Fundenberg then said wc
would be "implying" wc were in fa
vor of world federalism. "We'd be
placing the name of Stanford in dan
gerous waters."
Earlier in the evening Excom vot
ed to decide the issue itself rather
than ask for a poll or referendum of
the students.
Although Gil Jonas said that even
Excom didn't adequately understand
the issue yet, most of the members
felt that it had been adequately pub
licized. Bcthke asked if you had to
"beat people on the head'' to get
them to understand or take an in
terest.
