# Top Average Wins Trophy For Francaise
## 
### 
The French House was awarded
the Scholarship Cup yesterday at
AWS for the highest women's grade
average of 3.07 during fall quarter.
Casa of Lagunita took
second-place honors with 2.98. Casa
Granada, also of Lagunita, last year's
first-place winner with 3.05, drop
ped down to third place this year
with 2.97.
Casa Espariola dropped from sec
ond to fourth place with 2.96.
Averages for the other houses are
as follows:
Union Residence, 2.86; Eucalypto
(Lagunita), 2.80; Durand, 2.79; Elm
Cottage, 2.77; Guthrie, 2.76; Naran
ia (Lagunita), 2.73; Ventura, 2.73;
Madrono, 2.73; Lathrop, 2.73; Rus
sell, 2.73; Hurlburt, 2.70; and Sto
rey, 2.69.
Jordan, 2.66; Roth, 2.64; Olivo,
2.64; Roblc, 2.60; Branncr, 2.55;
Stillinan, 2.54; Mariposa, 2.47; Man
zanita, 2.45; and Adelfa, 2.38.
The Roblc average is inaccurate
at this time, because the grades for
women on Independent Study were
not computed. All students on the
Independent Study program have a
B average or better, so the revised
average for Roble is expected to be
higher.
The grade-point system for com
puting the above averages is one
point for each unit of D, two for each
unit of C, three for each unit of B,
and four for each unit of A.
