# Athletic Board May Select Football Coach Tomorrow
## 
### 
The all-important $64 question,
"Who will he the nc\t Stanford
football coach?" may be answered
at 10 a.m. tomorrow when the
Stanford Athlctic Board meets in
the Board of Trustees room to
consider the issue.
During the last week screening
has been done by Reg Caughey,
Tom Shaw, and John Hiirlburt of
the staff committee. They have
narrowed the field down to about
five candidates.
Should a decision he reached
tomorrow, it will not be an

nounced publicly until the recom
mendation has been made to Pres
ident Wallace Sterling. Following
his approval, the selection is given
to Ihe Board of Trustees for final
passage.
The general consensus is that
Chuck Taylor, who left Stanford
as frosh coach last year, will re
turn to the Farm in the role of
head varsity mentor.
Some observers have also men
tioned the names of Dutch Feh
ring, Mai Elward, Phil Bengtson,
and Clark Shauglinessy as other
possible candidates.
