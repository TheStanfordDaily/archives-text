# IT'S LONG UNDIES TIME
## Mercury Dips to 29 As Cold Spell Hits Farm 
### 
Out-of-state Stanford students were donning their long under
wear, and natives trying hard to deny California's coldest wave of
the winter, as temperatures this week dipped to below freezing
levels.
But the heavy coats, gloves, and scarfs seen on Quad were proof

that even native Californians thought I
the 31 degrees recorded by the Steam '
Plant at 8 a.m. yesterday was cold.!
The figure rose from the week's
low of 29 degrees recorded Wednes
day morning.
Snow was reported in South Palo
Alto and the Los Altos foothills j
Wednesday, though there was none
on Skyline Boulevard. Three
inches of powdery snow was re
ported on nearby Mt. Hamilton.
Dave Elliott, ASSU business man
ager, said the onslaught of cold j
weather will probably not delay the I
opening of Lake Lagunita.
The lake will probably open some
time after Washington's birthday, de
pending on the decision of Excom
with advice from the Boathouse, El
liot said. The lake opened Feb. 12
last year and March 19 in 1949.
Local weather conditions were in |
line with those throughout the na
tion, which has been lashed with
double-barreled blows of heavy i
snow and ice storms since Satur- j
day.
A United Press survey shows the

week-long stoms have already cost
189 lives.
Temperatures at Searsviile Lake
dropped to 7 degrees yesterday, 23
degrees Wednesday, according to
Ernest M. Brandsten, who operates
the lake.
Slightly warmer, but continued
cold is predicted today, with local
supplies of anti-freezes dwindling.
