mo himself asked Chang (o sit in for
a couple of numbers tonight, the
young trumpet player was set. "I'm
not even nervous," he confided.

Palo Alto Times carrier that he
was a ":a:sz genius" after Chang
sat in with him for a couple of
numbers in San Francisco two
weeks ago.
It was Chang's first experience
with night club life and he was a
bit taken back to discover that cokes
cost "85 cents APIECE!"
Chang went up to Pafael's to hear
Armstrong with Virginia Teale, who
was doing an interview for the Palo
Alto Times. Chang said, "I didn't
dream of ever talking to him, much
less playing in his band." Chang
played Jack Sheedy's trumpet after
Sheedy wandered in from across the
street for a iam session about 1 a.m.
When Satchmo learned that
Chang lived in Palo Alto, he in
vited him to sit in at his Stanford

else." Satchmo said. "And the only
good way to piny is with your
heart."
