# Cards Bid for National Rating
## 6th Ranked Bradley Is Indian Foe 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford hoop fans will get a
glimpse of one of the nation's
finest collegiate teams tomor
row night when the 18 and 3
Braves of Bradley University
move into the Cow Palace for a
9 p.m. engagement with the
men of Coach Everett Dean.
The occasion will mark the second
time in three nights that the Indians
have done battle with a team coached
b ya former Stanford hoop ace. The
Bradleys are mentored by Fordy
Anderson, an all-Conference per
former under Dean in 1941.
Last night the Cards met the Lui
setti-coached Stewart Chevrolets in
Stanford Pavilion. (See sports for
story.)
The Braves will he gunning for
their third straight win over Stan
ford in the brief interseetional se
ries. As in the first two contests,
the speedsters from Peoria, 111., will
rate odds-on favorites.
Bradley won in 1947 by 56 to 51. In
1948 they just did live up to the fa
vorite's role, 46 to 45, when diminu
tive fireball Gene Melchiorre robbed
the ball from Babe Higgins, dunked
the clincher a few seconds before the
final whistle.
Except fro the setting, tomorrow's
renewal is remarkably comparable to
the 1949 setting. Although Mel
choirre will be the only participant
who saw action on that memorable
evening, the current records of the
two teams render tomorrow s meet
ing exceedingly reminiscent of the
earlier Pavilion outing.
The Braves, once again come to
the Coast, with an enviable record
establishing them as a strong con
tender for the mythical national
crown. And Stanford, as in '49, must
rely on being "up" and performing
to the hilt of its capabilities if they
intend to hold their own against the
fast-breaking Midwesterners.
Just how enviable is the record of
Andersons crew is revealed by a
quick glance at the latest nation sta
tistics:
1. In winning 18 of their 21 games
to date, almost exclusively against
top-flight competition. Bradley has
compiled an impressive 75.6-point
average. That's the fourth highest
in the country, Cincinnati pacing
the pack with 79.8 per.
2. The Braves won their first 15
games of the year before being up
set by St. John's and the icy Madi
son Square Garden atmosphere.
And they haven't lost on their home
court all season.
15. Anderson's squad is now
ranked sixth in the nation, after
holding down the top spot the first
part of the season.
Although Melchoirre is admittedly


THE BIRD SCORES AGAlN—George "Bird" Yardley, rangy
Stewart Chevrolet forward, dumps in another effortless bucket
over the outstretched arms of three Stanford would-be guards—
Bruce Iversen (6), Jim Walsh (4), and Jack O'Sulivan (23). Jump
ing George set a new Pavilion individual scoring record of 33
points, as he led the Stewarts to a 80 to 64 victory.
