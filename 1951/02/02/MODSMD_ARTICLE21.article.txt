# Progress and Decisions
## 
### 
Hidden under the cloaks of student contro
versy and University problems are two quali
fies— right and wrong. Students frequently
analyze an issue from two viewpoints, pro and
:on, but seldom do they consider the possi
bility that the right or wrong decision may be
relative only to the overall goal of both par
ies.
Daring the past volume, you and I have seen
md analyzed local situations through the news
j.nd editorial columns of The Daily.
Looking over the topics of most interest. I
mmediately review the arguments connected
with the rehiring of Marchie Schwartz as head
iootball coach. Here, there probably was no
ibsolute right or wrong.
The SAB's decision had elements of both, de
pending on whether you felt the decision was
'lasly and unrealistic or whether you were
gratified that Stanford was assuming a posi
tion of leadership among other colleges by
stressing the character-building functions of a
head coach.
And by the same token, ASSU politics fur
nishes no absolute right or wrong. There exists
- and there always will exist — conservative
and liberal groups. Which is majority and
which is minority matters little. The important
thing is that in all decisions, the Executive
Committee must consider the relative argu
ments of both in terms of the overall policy de
sired.
The Daily, in this volume, has tried to pre
sent first, objective reports through the news
columns, and second, analyses and opinions
through editorials. I believe it is healthy for
Excom and the campus to consider the rela
tivity of right and wrong as well as to attack

problems with the liberal viewpoint so neces
sary for progress in government.
Nearly every organizaiton was once only a
"shot-in-the-dark" experiment. However, some
leaders foresaw the potential value in pushing
the idea until it moved from the also-ran class
to the front of the pack.
Stanford has progressed because enough
liberal thinkers have overcome the traditional
conservatism in special fields.
Education may assume more progressive
characteristics with a faculty rating system, a
revised lower division curriculum, and senior
evaluation conferences.
All-campus social life may be reactivated by
contributions from the few inert living groups.
The eating club building may soon raise fra
ternities to an even higher level of responsi
bility and achievement.
On a more altruistic level is Stanford's inter
national program which has progressed more
rapidly than any other phase of campus life.
Some day, students may see fit to consider
resolutions concerning matters of national im
portance such as the draft and educational loy
alty oaths.
Excom's intelligent discussion of the pro
posed representation at the Rome Peace Con
gress is indicative of the students' shift toward
a progressive attitude. During the debate, most
Excom members demonstrated interest in both
sides of the question—which three years ago
might have been tossed aside as something
unbecoming to the dignity of Stanfords' staid
personality.
This liberal attitude is the key to what the
staff and I have tried to give our readers.
