# The 						History of a Cartoon
## 
### 
"As far as the newspaper business is con
cerned, most cartoons die when the reader's
eye passes over them. But this dusty engraving
has even more significance today than it had a
year ago; perhaps it is wishful thinking for us
to hope that a year from now the cartoon on this
page will have a new interpretation —a mean
ing that would imply that all nations turned left
on the constructive road to peace."
So wrote a Daily editor on Oct. 11, 1948,
when The Daily printed the above cartoon for
the second time. At that time, the China Civil
war seemed "localized" around Canton, where
the Communists were knocking at the gates, of
the city. U.S. attention was toward Europe,
where East Germany was in the spotlight. The
Army and the Navy were still carrying on their
private feud and President Truman said that
the nation's defenses were adequate. At that
time, it looked as though the college man could
start down the left road as The Daily editor
had hoped.
Today, it looks like the student will take the
road to the right. His view wa3 changed for
him on June 25. 1950, when the North Koreans
crossed the 38th parallel. Three days later the
House of Representatives passed the one-year
draft bill. As the months passed, U.S. troops
fighting the United Nations' battle were pushed
into the Pusan pocket, and fought their way out
again to within sight of China border. Mean
while the draft was extended to 21 months.
Then the China Communists began their "vol
untary" action, and the UN forces were once
again pushed south of the South Korean capital
of Seoul, where they are now fighting.
The draft, universal military training, and

mobilization are on the minds of all students,
whether freshmen or seniors. A glance back to
April 12, 1948, when the above cartoon was
first printed, with the caption "Which Way?",
shows that the present senior class was once
faced with the same worries, at that time be
cause of increased tension in the occupied
zones of Germany and Berlin.
For an insight into our present concern as
college students, I reprint below portions of
the editorial I wrote for Freshman Edition
on that day in spring, 1948, six months before
the next Daily writer had such good hopes that
the student could take the road to the left:
"Today, the freshman class of '51 is in the
spotlight, both on campus and universally.
"Today, members of the class are busily en
gaged in studying history, to determine what
has been done in the past. Tomorrow, they
will make history.
"As the national and international situation
stands, the future is unpredictable to the frosh.
Talk of draft and universal military training
mingles with discussion of vocations and occu
pations. Freshman men nearing or at the age
of 19 don't know whether they will enter their
sophomore year next fall or three years from
now.
"Accompanying discussion on the possibili
ties of draft or UMT is the discussion on the
need for such measures. Can peace be ob
tained through armed or unarmed preparation?
"These are serious thoughts for a class of
which the majority was fortunate enough to
escape fighting in World War II."
History seems to have answered my ques
tion for the present. Let us hope a bettpr an
swer is to be found.- A 1 McCombs.

Then the China Communists began their "vol
untary" action, and the UN forces were once
again pushed south of the South Korean capital
of Seoul, where they are now fighting.
The draft, universal military training, and

mobilization are on the minds of all students,
whether freshmen or seniors. A glance back to
April 12, 1948, when the above cartoon was
first printed, with the caption "Which Way?",
shows that the present senior class was once
faced with the same worries, at that time be
cause of increased tension in the occupied
zones of Germany and Berlin.
For an insight into our present concern as
college students, I reprint below portions of
the editorial I wrote for Freshman Edition
on that day in spring, 1948, six months before
the next Daily writer had such good hopes that
the student could take the road to the left:
"Today, the freshman class of '51 is in the
spotlight, both on campus and universally.
"Today, members of the class are busily en
gaged in studying history, to determine what
has been done in the past. Tomorrow, they
will make history.
"As the national and international situation
stands, the future is unpredictable to the frosh.
Talk of draft and universal military training
mingles with discussion of vocations and occu
pations. Freshman men nearing or at the age
of 19 don't know whether they will enter their
sophomore year next fall or three years from
now.
"Accompanying discussion on the possibili
ties of draft or UMT is the discussion on the
need for such measures. Can peace be ob
tained through armed or unarmed preparation?
"These are serious thoughts for a class of
which the majority was fortunate enough to
escape fighting in World War II."
History seems to have answered my ques
tion for the present. Let us hope a bettpr an
swer is to be found.- A 1 McCombs.

"As far as the newspaper business is con
cerned, most cartoons die when the reader's
eye passes over them. But this dusty engraving
has even more significance today than it had a
year ago; perhaps it is wishful thinking for us
to hope that a year from now the cartoon on this
page will have a new interpretation —a mean
ing that would imply that all nations turned left
on the constructive road to peace."
So wrote a Daily editor on Oct. 11, 1948,
when The Daily printed the above cartoon for
the second time. At that time, the China Civil
war seemed "localized" around Canton, where
the Communists were knocking at the gates, of
the city. U.S. attention was toward Europe,
where East Germany was in the spotlight. The
Army and the Navy were still carrying on their
private feud and President Truman said that
the nation's defenses were adequate. At that
time, it looked as though the college man could
start down the left road as The Daily editor
had hoped.
Today, it looks like the student will take the
road to the right. His view wa3 changed for
him on June 25. 1950, when the North Koreans
crossed the 38th parallel. Three days later the
House of Representatives passed the one-year
draft bill. As the months passed, U.S. troops
fighting the United Nations' battle were pushed
into the Pusan pocket, and fought their way out
again to within sight of China border. Mean
while the draft was extended to 21 months.
