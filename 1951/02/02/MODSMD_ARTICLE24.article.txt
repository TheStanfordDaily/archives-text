# 'Canton--Mother Of Revolutions'

### DAVID WONG 
Brown terraced hills and native villages passed by as the train
rumbled its way along the 90 miles separating Kowloon and Can
ton. It was the winter of 1947, and the cold north wind was howling
out from the center of China. I was getting my first look at China
in 12 years.
The China I saw was not a China seen from a soft upholstered

seat in the first-class compartment.
Nor was it a China seen while en
joying the modest comforts of a sec
ond-class seat. What I saw was the
real China, a China seen from a
hard wooden bench in a dirty,
smoke - filled, third - class compart
ment.
The people in the compartment
were the hard-working but down
trodden peasants and workers, who
formed 90 per cent of the population.
Ttheir nut-brown faces looked un
der - nourished, and their garments
looked worn.
They filled the seats, the aisle,
and the floor. Every remaining
nook and crevice housed some ar
ticle of personal belonging, and
overhead a shaky rack groaned
under the accumulated weight of
more boxes, baskets, and bundles.
Before the journey was half over,
the train had to stop. There had been
a delay farther up the line, a delay
which lasted three hours. During
that time, some military policemen
pushed their way into tHe compart
ment and demanded an inspection of
all luggage.
The scene was chaotic as the pas
sengers scrambled for their posses
sions. After they had left the lug
gage of half a dozen passengers in a
disordered mess, the military police
men gave up the inspection and left.
Some of the male passengers cursed.
IVly experiences on the train

gave me an all too accurate pic
ture of what to expect in Canton.
In the months that followed I saw
| the same milling humanity, the
I same governmental inefficiency,
and the same arrogance of petty
officials stuffed with self - impor
tance.
Canton was a sprawling city of
' more than a million people. In many
places bombed - out buildings still
I stood like skeletons against the sky,
with a mushroom growth of wooden
j huts springing up in their shadows.
With currency becoming more
I worthless by the hour and more and
i more people living on the verge of
! starvation, Canton, the Mother of
Revolutions, seemed ripe for anoth
er one.
As I watched ignorant urchins
1 shivering in the cold, and destitute
i adults dying in the streets. I
I thought: Perhaps good govern
ment is needed more urgently than
•'representative'' government.
Then the Communists came. They
j brought greater efficiency, but they
also brought greater regimentation
jof thought and action. Taxes went
up, but the basic problems still re
mained unsolved.
Whether Canton, the Mother of
• Revloutions, harbors hi her skirts
i the heartbeats of another uprising
remains to be seen.

remains to be seen.
Brown terraced hills and native villages passed by as the train
rumbled its way along the 90 miles separating Kowloon and Can
ton. It was the winter of 1947, and the cold north wind was howling
out from the center of China. I was getting my first look at China
in 12 years.
The China I saw was not a China seen from a soft upholstered

seat in the first-class compartment.
Nor was it a China seen while en
joying the modest comforts of a sec
ond-class seat. What I saw was the
real China, a China seen from a
hard wooden bench in a dirty,
smoke - filled, third - class compart
ment.
The people in the compartment
were the hard-working but down
trodden peasants and workers, who
formed 90 per cent of the population.
Ttheir nut-brown faces looked un
der - nourished, and their garments
looked worn.
They filled the seats, the aisle,
and the floor. Every remaining
nook and crevice housed some ar
ticle of personal belonging, and
overhead a shaky rack groaned
under the accumulated weight of
more boxes, baskets, and bundles.
Before the journey was half over,
the train had to stop. There had been
a delay farther up the line, a delay
which lasted three hours. During
that time, some military policemen
pushed their way into tHe compart
ment and demanded an inspection of
all luggage.
The scene was chaotic as the pas
sengers scrambled for their posses
sions. After they had left the lug
gage of half a dozen passengers in a
disordered mess, the military police
men gave up the inspection and left.
Some of the male passengers cursed.
IVly experiences on the train

gave me an all too accurate pic
ture of what to expect in Canton.
In the months that followed I saw
| the same milling humanity, the
I same governmental inefficiency,
and the same arrogance of petty
officials stuffed with self - impor
tance.
Canton was a sprawling city of
' more than a million people. In many
places bombed - out buildings still
I stood like skeletons against the sky,
with a mushroom growth of wooden
j huts springing up in their shadows.
With currency becoming more
I worthless by the hour and more and
i more people living on the verge of
! starvation, Canton, the Mother of
Revolutions, seemed ripe for anoth
er one.
As I watched ignorant urchins
1 shivering in the cold, and destitute
i adults dying in the streets. I
I thought: Perhaps good govern
ment is needed more urgently than
•'representative'' government.
Then the Communists came. They
j brought greater efficiency, but they
also brought greater regimentation
jof thought and action. Taxes went
up, but the basic problems still re
mained unsolved.
Whether Canton, the Mother of
• Revloutions, harbors hi her skirts
i the heartbeats of another uprising
remains to be seen.
