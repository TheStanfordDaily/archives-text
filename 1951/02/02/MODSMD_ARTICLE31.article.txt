## LEAGUE OPENER Ruggers Go Against PA 
### 
Tomorrow at 2:30 Pete Kmetovic's
Stanford rugby team will meet the
Palo Alto Ramblers at the JV prac
tice field, marking the first official
league game for the ruggers. They
have won two practice games al
ready, one against the Ramblers, 5
to 0, and against the Olympic Club.
11 to 8.
The Palo Alto team, composed
mainly of former San Jose State ath
letes, boasts one of the finest kickers
in the Bay Area, 200-pound Howie
Sonnicksen.
They have a fine, well-balanced
team with plenty of heft in the scrum.
Former gridders include Bruce Hal
laday, 202; Jim Wheelahan, 227;
Keith Carpenter, 230; Hoy Poznikoff,
185; and Roy Giorgi, 200,' who played
for USF.
Footballers Bill McColl and Johnny
Banks, both potential starters, will
probably see no action because of
colds.
