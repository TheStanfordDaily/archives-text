# Chevs Whip Cards; Bradley Next
## Yardley Hot; Hits for 33 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's basketeers tried hard in
the Pavilion last night, but class and
George Yardley proved too much
as the Stewart Chevrolet AAUers
romped to an 80 to 64 victory.
Blond George, who only last year
broke Hank Luisetti's "Southern Di
vision scoring record while playing
for the Cards, registered a new Pa
vilion mark by tanking 33 points
against his old teammates.
Yardley counted his record total
on a varied assortment of set shots,
jumps, and tips, 14 in ail. plus nine
markers from the free throw line.
His first 29 points were scored in 27
minutes,
George Walker and Yardley com
bined to give the Stewarts an early
1(> to 9 lead, and the issue was never
in doubt after that.
But the Cards did manage to keep
the score in sight, 40 to 32, at rest
time, mainly on the strength of some
superb work under both backboards
by Indian center Jim Rainstead.
Ramstead tanked six baskets the
first 10 minutes, managing also to
steal a few rebounds from Stewart
big boys Don Hendricksen. Walker,
and Yardley.
With the opening of the second
frame, however, Yardley really
caught fire and brought the surpris
ingly sparse crowd to its feet for the
first time in the evening. The Bird,
who had scored 15 points the first
half, nearly doubled that output in
the first seven minutes of the sec
ond on a rapid barrage of six goals
and two charity tosses.
That set the score at 65 to 41 and
removed all doubt of the outcome.
Gary Andrews and Jack O'Sulli
van managed to close the gap in the
waning moments with two baskets
each, and Sid Hasler connected at
the whistle with the two - point
finale.
Ramstead was high for the hosts,
scoring 18 points on seven field goals
and four free throws. He was fol
lowed by Ed Tucker with three bas
kets. nine charities, and 15 points.
For the victors, Don Hendricksen
connected six times from the floor
nad George Walker sank five.
But tell the tale of Yardley and
you've told the tale of the ball game.


SO CLOSE—Stanford's Ed Tucker (9) leaps high into the air for
a tip that just missed the bucket in the first half action against
the Stewart Chevrolets last night. Guarding Tucker very
closely is Stewart's Bob Walker (17). Other players pictured
above are Stanford's Jim Ramstead (10) and Jack O'Sullivan (23),
and Stewart's Don Hendricksen (16) and Frank Kuzara (5).
