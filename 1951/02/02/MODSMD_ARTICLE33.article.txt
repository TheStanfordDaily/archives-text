# Frosh Trounce Saint Mary's
## 
### 
Stanford's Papooses, showing their
best form ot' the season, dumped the
highly-touted St. Mary's freshman
squad, 79 to 54, last night.
With Dave Epperson controlling
both backboards, and Harold Ellis
and Don DeLong leading the fast
break, the Papooses had little trouble
gaining their eleventh triumph of the
season.
The Cardbabes started fast and ran
the legs off the Gael frosh to pile tip
a 41 to 29 halftime advantage. Had it
not been for forward Bill Bagley's
sensational shooting during this pe
riod, the Gaels would not even have
been in hailing distance at the half.
Epperson, with a great all-around
performance, hooped 28 points to cop
the night's scoring honors. It was his
shooting which kept the Gaels at a
distance when they put on a belated
second-half rally to close the gap to
12 points. The Cards then put on a
rally of their own, and at the finish
were pulling ever farther ahead.
