# 'Intense Cold' Halts Ascent Of Sierra Peak
## 
### 
Last weekend four Stanford Al
piners attempted to make the first
winter ascent of Mt. Ritter, 13,162-
foot peak in the Sierra Nevadas.
The group drove to Silver Lake,
situated in the region south of Mono
Lake, arriving there about 5 p.m.
Friday. Carrying "light" packs
weighing only 25 pounds, the adven
turers skied cross country in the
moonlight.
They skied all day Saturday and
camped that night in a crevass above
the timberline. The cold was so in
tense that their air mattress became
brittle and broke.
The Stanfordites got up at three
in the morning and climbed the sad
dle between Mt. Ritter and Mt. Ban
ner. The icy slopes of Mt. Ritter
made further. ascent impossible, so
the climbers, protecting themselves
as best they could from the intense
cold, waited for the sun to come up.
According to reports, the pre
dawn darkness was broken by the
fiery glow of what was believed to
be the atomic bomb blast in Nevada.
Although the light was momentarily
intense, the men heai'd no sound.
When the sun rose, the group de
cided to climb Mt. Banner (12,963
feet), since their lack of time pre
vented climbing the higher peak.
The Alpiners, A 1 Baxter, Jim Moore,
Cliff Hopson, and Carl Stauffer, de
scended the mountain in record time
and skied the 10 miles back to Sil
ver Lake. They are unanimous in
one determination: not to sleep again
above the timberline without a tent.
