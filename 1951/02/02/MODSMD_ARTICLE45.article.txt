# 'Lone Woman' Rule May Be Changed
## 
### 
Fundamental Standard Committee
this week reviewed a report from
Interfraternity Council favoring al
teration of the "lone woman" rul
ing in women's social regulations.
The alteration proposal is also
scheduled for presentation to the
AWS Board, whose cabinet has al
ready approved it.
The regulation in question re
stricts a woman from entering a
man's living group without at least
one other woman. The Fundamental
Standard Committee hopes to alter
the ruling to allow a lone woman to
enter certain areas of a living group
during certain times of day.
