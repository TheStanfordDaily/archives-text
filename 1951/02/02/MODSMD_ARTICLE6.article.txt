# PLAYGOER JURY PUZZLED
## 'The Trial' Closes On Mixed Verdict 
### MARY LODMELL 
"The Trial" went on trial last night before a playgoer jury. By
intermission there were puzzled expressions, diverse criticisms,
but by the last curtain —a hung jury, with a psychological hang
over.
An exceptionally large cast — approximately 40 — presented

their case and defended it well.
The supporting cast, the pre
scribed, automaton - like, haunted
faces, and three wicked little girls
were excellent. The cast's men in
general surpassed the women irt the
major parts, and James Clancy, the
lead, did a magnificent job in com
manding audience identification.
Jean Leonard, as Miss Burstner,
was perhaps too young and sweet
for her sordid environment; Mrs.

I Gruback, played by Janet Karaha
. dian, may have overdone her direct
ed gestures; Theresia Reimers, the
laundress, need not have exagger
ated her sultriness (all one had to do
was look at her!); but they were well
enough backed up by the "stronger
j sex."
Special mention to the lawyer,
Block, played hy M. Nicholas Gilroy,
| and to the bailiff, Homer T. Bower.
Fantastic stage effects, a night
marish quality, the sadistic noncha
lance of the actors, good crowd
j scenes, a severe criticism of society
by Kafka, the maze of court proce
' dures, and a moral besides—all can
! best describe "The Trial."
Probably no one in the audience
went away with the same "verdict."
It was agreed that the sets were
magnificent, timing was good, parts
were generally well played—but as
to the "hangover"—decide for your-
I self tonight or tomorrow.
