## UN Troops Halted By Suicide Forces 
### 
TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 5 (UP)—
Chinese Communist suicide forces
stalled the United Nations advance
toward Seoul Sunday but their fa
natical resistance cost them more
than 12,000 casualties in two days.
The UN troops were closing in on
the Korean capital along an eight- to
nine-mile arc in the rugged moun
tains below Seoul under crushing
artillery and air attacks that left the
enemy shell-shocked in their forti
fied bunkers..
Patrols earlier were reported
within seven miles of Seoul but
front dispatches left no doubt the
main Allied forces were eight to nine
miles away from the Communist
held capital.
Communist artillery batteries —
many of them firing captured Amer
ican howitzers — blasted the Allied
lines nine to 12 miles south of Seoul
with the heaviest barrage yet in the
stubborn Red defensive stand.
