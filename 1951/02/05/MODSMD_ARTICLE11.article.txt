# Frosh Back Vandal Plan
## 
### 
Three freshmen appeared Thurs
day before Men's Council to pre
sent a program for the prevention of
vandalism between Stanford and
California ddring the pre-Big Game
week.
An outgrowth of the cases of 15
frosh who were brought before the
Council last quarter for vandalism
on the Berkeley campus, the pro
gram was drawn up instead of hours
at the Con Home by the convicted
men.
The men had been given sentences
ranging from 25 to 35 hours, 15 of
which were suspended by the Coun
cil with the reservation that the men
draw up a program to indoctrinate
next fall's freshmen on the non-ag
gression pact with Cal.
To bring the plan into operation,
the program includes provisions for
articles in The Daily, revision of the
section on the pact in the Frosh
Bible, a discussion in the frosh Fun
damental Standard talk, and other
means of advertising the pact.
The committee of 15 has the re
sponsibility of carrying out the plan
in the fall under the supervision of
Men's Council.
In carrying out the program the
committee intends to stress that the
vandalism is a violation of the Fun
damental Standard and offenders
arc subject to expulsion.
