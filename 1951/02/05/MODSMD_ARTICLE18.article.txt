recommended Taylor's appointment
to the board, announced that Taylor
would have "complete freedom in

"We have canvassed the field
very carefully and arrived at the
unanimous decision that Chuck
Taylor is the best man for the head
football coaching position at Stan

coach, will do a splendid job for
us, and it is a pleasure to welcome
him back to the st'dT."
Final SAB decision to appoint
Taylor, former Indian frosh coach
from 1947 to 1949, came after a short,
discussion period in which every
member of the board expressed en
thusiasm over his nomination.
Masters said Taylor's name was
selected out of a list of some 30 to
35 applicants, "many of whom we
were considering."
Taylor, who said he had the ap
proval of Tony Morabito, owner of
the San Francisco '49ers, "to termi
nate my employment at any time,"
indicated that he "would stick to the
T-tormation at Stanford with our
own little variations of it."

Taylor said Ghilotti. last year's
freshman coach, might coach a com
bined frosh-jayvee team if the PCC

allows freshmen to play varsity ball.
Masters said the chances were
"five to one" that freshmen would be
allowed to play on varsity teams
next September.
Besides Ghilotti, Taylor said he
would appoint four assistant varsity
coaches—two line coaches, offensive
and defensive, and an offensive and
defensive backfield coach. The coach
said he would tutor the quarterbacks
and ends himself.
Taylor, who was 31 years old

and has the ability to judge a man's
qualifications very well . . ."
