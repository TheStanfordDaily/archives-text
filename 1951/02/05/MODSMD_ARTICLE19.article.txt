# Farm Will Join Texas Water Meet

### 
Stanford's Athletic Board agreed
last Saturday to send a "representa
tive swimming team" to the NCAA
swimming meet in Austin, Tex.,
March 22-24.
The action came after Athletic Di
rector Ai Masters pointed out that
Stanford has participated regularly
in NCAA competition in swimming,
golf, tennis, and track. He said tho
trip would cost an estimated $2,000.
In other business, Masters assertc d
that the Board has already gone
$4,000 "in the red" due to a loss of
$1,387 on games played thus far in
the Cow Paalce, and a "bad break"
when the Indians played in Madison
Square Garden during the Christ
mas holiday. The deficit, however, i:;
exclusive of Big Game receipts,
which have yet to be totaled, Mas
ters said.
The "bad break" came as a result
of a New York snowstorm which re -
portedly dissuaded many from at
tending the game.
The Board voted to spend $s,■•')')
this summer to paint the stadium,
but decided to tack the expense onto
next year's budget because of press
ing financial obligations this year.
The Board voted to pay Marrhi"
Schwartz through March 1, and also
agreed to change the effective dates
of coaching contracts hereafter from
Sept. 1-Aug. 31 to Feb. 1-Jan. Mi.
