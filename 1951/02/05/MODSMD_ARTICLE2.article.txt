WASHINGTON, Feb. i (UP) â€”
Associate Supreme Court Justice
Harold H. Burton tonight denied a
last-chance appeal to stay the exe
cution of three Negroes scheduled to
die Monday at Richmond, Va., for
raping a white woman.
Burton lsitened to pleas by de
fense attorneys in an extraordinary
Sunday night hearing in his cham
bers at the Supreme Court.
His ruling was similar to one made
early Friday by Chief Justice Fred
M. Vinson of the Supreme Court.
Vinson denied an appeal on behalf
of all seven of the Martinsville, Va.,
Negroes convicted of raping the
woman some two years ago. Four of
the men were executed later Friday.
