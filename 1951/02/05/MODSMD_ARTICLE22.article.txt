# Working Together on a New Coach
## 
### 
We feel praise is due the Stanford Athletic
Board for the expeditious, thorough, and sensi
ble way in which it handled the appointment
of Chuck Taylor to the head coaching position.
First aware of the Marchie Schwartz resigna
tion barely one month ago, the Board went
.right to work screening and interviewing top
candidates for the job. All told, the Board's
representative, Al Masters, canvassed approxi
mately 35 men. some of whom had applied for
Ihe job and others who had not.
Most gratifying aspect of the month-long ac
tivities, however, was the high degree of en
thusiasm exhibited by each board member last
Saturday morning when Taylor's name was
proposed. Alumni, faculty, and student repre
sentatives alike agreed that "Chuck" would do
a fine job. Moreover, Taylor himself feels he
can do the trick.
The smoothness with which the selection
was handled may serve, in part, to give us a
better appreciation of what goes on "behind
the scenes" at Stanford. At USC, in the recent
consideration of a new head coach, there is no
such thing as student representation on the
"Faculty Committee on Athletics."

Trojan students are justifiably up in arms
about their lack of representation. They point
to the fact that students at Stanford, UCLA, Cal,
and Washington all have a voice in determin
ing athletic policy. Editorials in the Daily Tro
jan have emphasized the need for student rep
resentation "to please a great number of stu
dents who believe that the administration and
faculty have student welfare at heart, but who
have to be shown some proof occasionally."
Proof of the pudding was certainly in evi
dence last Saturday morning. Stanford stu
dents did have a voice in the selection of
Chuck Taylor. All you have to do is poll stu
dent opinion on the subject.
To our minds, one of the greatest indications
of the kind of feeling that will surround
Coach Taylor during his stay on campus took
place Saturday morning when former Taylor
ites Tom Shaw and Jess Cone congratulated
the red-haired ex-All-American after confirma
tion of his appointment.
Putting his arm on Taylor's shoulder, guarter
back Shaw said something like this: "It's swell,
Chuck; I know you'll do a great job."
How many of us feel the same way!
