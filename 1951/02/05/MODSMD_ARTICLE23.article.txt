# A 						Word About News Policy
## 
### 
Volume 119 of The Stanford Daily begins to
day. Frankly we are scared. We will cover
the campus as well as we can—but we will
make mistakes. We apologize for those future
mistakes—for not covering your speech, for
spelling your name wrong.
But there are times when we mast use our
news judgment and relegate your story to the
bottom of the page instead of playing it "top."
We will not apologize for those times. It is the
function of a newspaper to report news objec
tively. We must choose the news we think is
important.
Cardinals last week protested to Excom
about "the lack of publicity" given to the Louis
Armstrong dance. In the minutes of a meeting

Cardinals stated that there were four pictures of
the blood campaign in the Daily and only a
short story on the dance. Cardinals neglected
to mention that the dance was given two front
page pictures a few days before.
We feel we gave consistent, more than ample
space to the dance for a period of two weeks.
If Cardinals had come to us first with their ob
jections. instead of airing them via their min
utes, we feel an understanding on the matter
could have been reached.
What is news and what is not news is a de
cision The Daily must make for itself. More
over we promise to continue to make the fairest
and most objective decision within our powers.
