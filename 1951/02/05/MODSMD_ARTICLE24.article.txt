# Verdict Questioned
## CAMPUS OPINION 
### 
To the Editor:
As one read Mary Lodmell's review of "The Trial"
in Friday's Daily, it became obvious that she did not
•jiiite know what she was writing about.
Miss Lodmell refers to the play as a psychological
one. It is, rather, philosophical and theological. The
Daily also called it a melodrama, which it is not. If
one were to pigeon-hole its technique, there are argu
ments for calling it expressionistic and surrealistic,
but "melodramatic" seems a misrepresentation.
Miss Lodmell furthermore reported that the audi
ence was puzzled by "The Trial." Apparently bewil
dered herself, she was unable to tell us why. As a
critic, she should have pinntd down the reason for
confusion—told us what the play was attempting to
say and evaluated the success or failure of the Stan
ford Players in interpreting thi.s message. Miss Lod
mell's criticism of the acting seemed good until one
realized that it was invalid because she did not under
stand the play and consequently was not in a position
to judge the interpretation of the roles.
Block, incidentally, is not the lawyer, as Miss Lod
inell says in her review, but the perpetual defendant

all they might like to say.— The Editors.)
