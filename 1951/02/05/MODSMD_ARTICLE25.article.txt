# Swift and the 'Standard'
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In all the shouting about the Wesley Swift affair,
one very important issue has been obscured—the vio
lation of the Fundamental Standard.
Every student agrees to uphold it when he enrolls
in Stanford, and violation can be grounds for expul
sion. The Fundamental Standard includes "respect for
the rights of others" as was pointed out in this column
last week.
Now. there is no question that Dr. Swift's constitu
tional rights were not respected by those students who
.shouted, hissed, and finally forced him to stop speak
ing. These students have broken their word to Stan
ford, to say nothing of discrediting all Stanford stu
dents in the eyes of the rest of the audience.
Therefore, they should apologize:
1. To I)r. Sterling and the Fundamental Standard
Committee,*
and
2. To Dr. Swift for their un-American behavior
as well as their total lack of common courtesy.
Lastly, we should like to inquire why the Funda
mental Standard Committee has not seen fit to take
a definite stand on this affair.
As we see it.the Fundamental Standard must be
t nlorced before it becomes a mockery and a farce.
