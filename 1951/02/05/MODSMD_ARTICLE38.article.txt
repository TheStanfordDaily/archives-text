# Cards Almost Upset Braves, Edged 61-58
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Bradley University's Braves, who make a habit of winning bas
ketball games in the final minute, repeated their favorite stunt
Saturday night to capture a 61 to 53 decision over Stanford in one
of the most hectic windups in recent Cow Palace history.
The Braves' Charley Grover, whose 22 points were high for the

evening, added the clincher from
the free throw line with 17 seconds
left in the game. That broke a 58 to
58 tie and gave Bradley the lead for
the first time since the first two min
utes of play.
Gene "Squeaky" Melchiorre added
a gift lay-in 10 seconds later, but
this- contribution was unnecessary
insurance to the Braves' thrilling
comeback and ultimate victory.
Stanford was for the inter
sectional battle and turned in its
finest performance of the year in
blazing to an early commanding lead
and almost protecting it all the way.
Cards Grab Big Lead
Alter a Grover jump shot and a
Melchiorre free throw gave Bradley
a 3 to 1 lead in the first minutes,
Stanford stormed back with a rapid
barrage of goals by Jim Ramstead,
Jim Walsh, Captain Jack O'Sullivan,
and Eddie Tucker to gain an irripres
sive 22 to (i edge over the surprised
Midwesterners midway through the
lirst half.
The Braves were admittedly ice
cold during this period, hitting some
thing under 20 per cent of their at
tempts from the floor.
But take nothing away from the
men of Everett Dean. With Ram
stead, Walsh, and Bruce Iversen
gaining almost complete control over
both boards, the Indians' offense hit
Ihis season's peak those first 10 min
utes.
Bradley Recovers
The final 10 minutes of the first half
was fought on more even terms as
the Braves began to recover from
their initial shock and, with Grover
and Fred Schlictman combining to
close the big gap, regained some of
the smooth-working form that has
won them 20 games while dropping
but three this season.
On the Stanford side of the ledger
Tucker, Iversen, and reserve Gary
Andrews took over the scoring re
sponsibility, hitting a pair of goals
each that allowed the Indians to leave
the court with an 11-point budge, 37
to 20, at the rest period.
Braves Close Gap
The final "frame found Bradley
creeping up relentlessly on the now
desperate Cards; but it wasn't until
the clocked showed four minutes left
that they were finally able, by vir
tue of a lightning seven-point out
burst by Grover and Schlihctman. to
pull up even at 58-all.
The set-shot accuracy of Schlict
man proved to be the telling factor.in
Bradley's comeback. The clever
Brave forward hit live long goals
Irom as far out as 40 feet, finally
forcing Stanford to abandon its pre
viously effective zone for a .shifting
man-to-man defense.
With the score tied, the four min
utes preceding Glover's all-impor
tant charity effort were played with
extreme caution and deliberation on
both sides.
Finally, with the second hand
making its final sweep and Stanford
in possession, the Indians made their
bid for victory.
Stanford Attempt Fails
O'Sullivan bounced to Ramstead
on the post, who pivoted, hooked, and
missed while the 10,298 fans, largest
of the season for the Palace, groaned
with disappointment.
The groans turned to cries of sheer
anguish when, with the clock reading
17 seconds, Iversen fouled Grover in
the light for the rebound of Ram
stead's shot.
Alter the Braves called a time-out
period, Grover returned to sink the
free throw, and Stanford roared
down court for the final effort.
Again Ramstead missed, was lied
up by Jim Kelly on the rebound. The
ensuing jump ball was batted toward
iho Bradley basket where it was cap
tured by Buzz Ott of the invaders.
Ott fired to Melchoirre, Squeaky
dropped it through the'net. and the
final buzzer sounded.
112 hat was it, (> 1 to 58. and Bradley's
recoid was undamaged by the top
Stanford performance of the year.
