# Public Favors Taylor Pick
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Public opinion appeared to be 100
per cent behind Chuck Taylor and
his selection as head football coach
at Stanford. Everywhere the feeling
was that the youthful, red - haired
ex-guard was the only wise choice
that the Stanford Athletic Board
could make.
Campus comments went like this:
Bill McColl — "The selection of
Chuck Taylor is a wise and natural
choice."
Dick Clcgg— "The best possible
choice for Stanford, including all the
possible choices in the country."
Coach Everett S. Dean — "Swell!
Chuck, being a Stanford man, knows
the situation here, and he knows the
alumni. All in all, a very happy
selection."
Dr. Stanley Lourdeaux, team phy
sician—"l'm glad to see the organi
zation stay intact. If the service
'doesn't break up the team, we have
the nucleus of a good outfit. Chuck
knows the personnel, and he knows
the rest of the athletic setup and can
fit right in."
Jack Alexander—"l think Chuck's
a great guy, and it's a good deal for
him. He's sure a fine coach."
Bill Alhouse, frosh baseball coach
• —"They couldn't have made a bet
ter move."
Mr. Leonard Nelson of Palo Alto—
"I've adopted Stanford, and if I'd
been selecting, he'd have been my
man. Chuck Taylor is a 100 per cent
choice."
Tom Shaw — "It's good to have
Chuck back in the Stanford family
again. I think that he's an excellent
man for us."'
Mr. Louie Brown. ATO cook and
football follower — "Well, I think

he'll make an especially good coach.
He did well with .the frosh team, and
that's what we need — a coach in
whom we have plenty of confi
dence."
Frank Tencrello — "I think the
will really work hard for
him and prove that he's a good
coach."
Dave Stott, alumnus and now in
the U.S. Navy—"Taylor is a wonder
ful guy, and I think that his choice
is great for Stanford. I'd be glad to
go and watch Stanford even if they
lost with that guy coaching."
Bob Murphy —"I don't see how
they can help but have a winning
spirit with three members of the
1941 Rose Bowl team—Taylor, Lind
skog, and Kmetovic —as coaches."
Jim Castagnoli. assistant frosh
football coach - "The only choice
they had a good man and excellent
selection."
The only big problem seemed to
be, "How about the draft? Will we
have a team?" But they let it be
known that if Stanford does have a
football team this vear, Chuck Tay
lor is the man they want to coach it.
