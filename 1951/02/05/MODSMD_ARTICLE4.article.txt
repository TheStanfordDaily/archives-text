# Price Control Fight
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”A surprise move
by the Justice Department to take
over all price control enforcement
touched off a top-level power fight
today that threatened to upset the
whole controls program.
High government sources said Mi-,
chael V. DiSalle's price control agen
cy, caught fiat-footed by the sudden
grab at its powers, has stopped hir
ing agents to enforce the 10-day-old
price freeze until the issue is settled.
In the meantime, they said, pricc,
controls are practically unenforce
able.
