### 
TUCSON, Ariz., Feb. 4 (UP)-A
lame neck and a game back proved
no handicap for dapper Lloyd Man
grum, Chicago, today as he won his
second $10,000 Tucson Open with a
four-day score of 269.
It was ailing Mangrum's second
Tucson victory in three years. He
established a course record of 263 in
winning top money in 1949. Last
year the Tucson event was named in
his honor after he was temporarily
disabled in an auto accident.
