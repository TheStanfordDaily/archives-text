## Cards Win Relay To Beat Invading Texas 
### 
Tom Haynie's Stanford swimming
team beat the University of Texas
44 to 31 Friday afternoon before a
near capacity crowd in the Encina
Pools.
Stanford had to win the last race,
the 400-yard freestyle relay, to win
the meet. Phil Chapman started off
for the Cards and picked up about
three yards on his man. and Bert
Holiday and Bruce Putnam in
creased the lead to 12 yards.
Bobby Thompson and Texas'
Olympic swimmer Eddie Gilbert
swam the last lap: Thompson went
53.0 to stave off Gilbert's fine last
lap. and Stanford won the race by 10
yards, and the meet by 13 points.
Outstanding performances of the
day were, those of distance swimmer
Pete Cole for the Indians. Cole, un
impressed with Gilbert's reputation,
passed him on the lost length of the
220 to win in the good time of 2:24.
The crowd got a thrill out of the
spectacular diving performances of
Skip Browning and Milton Davis for
Texas and the Cards' Bill Glathe.
Browning, who goes into the water
at any angle v/ith no splash, won
with 421 points, and Davis edged
Glathe for second, 337 to 324.
The other winners for Stanford
were Putnam, by a hair, in the back
stroke and the medley relay team of
Putnam, Ash Jones, and Thompson.
The team entered the Letterman
Hospital Open Meet Friday night in
San Francisco. Putnam took second

in the individual medley and third in
the 100 freestyle. Thompson got sec
ond in the 100. and Glathe was sec- J
ond in the Pacific Association AAU ,
low board diving.
