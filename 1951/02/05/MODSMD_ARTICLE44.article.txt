## Ruggers Rout PA Ramblers; Latham Stars 
### 
Displaying awesome power and
pin - point precision, the Stanford
rugby team steamrollered over the
Palo Alto Ramblers 41-115 Saturday
afternoon in their first 1951 league
game.
The ruggers got off to an early
lead when Sam Thornton booted a
penalty kirk from 30 yards out. With
the score 3-0. Al Kirkland lateraled
to Jesse Cone who scored. Sam
Thornton converted and the score
was 8-0 with two minutes gone in
the game. Then the rout began.
Russ Latham scored on a beautiful
20-yard broken field run. Norm Ma
noogian fell on the ball in the end
zone three minutes later, and with
five mintues left in the half Fred
Nelson ran the ball five yards for a
score. After each "try" Sam Thorn
ton converted and by the end of the
first half Stanford had piled up a
23-8 lead.
Stanford showed the same form in
the second half; within 20 minutes
they scored an additional 18 points.
Bob Stanley, Gordy Rice, Jack Bo
netti, and Bernie Tokarcz all carried
the ball over for scores, Thornton
converting on every one but the last.
Probably the outstanding per
formance of the afternoon was
turned in by Russ Latham, a star for
British Columbia in 1950. It was La
tham's brilliant running and all
around play that accounted for prac
tically all of Stanford's scoring op
portunities. Dave Anderson, a front
ranker, showed exceptional play in
the scrum.
