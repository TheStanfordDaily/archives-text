## 
### 
The Southern Pacific Railroad
announced last night that 17
small commuter trains were set
to make the Peninsula run from
San Jose to San Francisco this
morning if yardmen in San Jose
reported to work at midnight.
Commuter trains will return from
San Francisco to San Jose in the eve
ning, officials said, only if San Fran
cisco yard crews report to work today
for the 8 a.m. shift.
All Peninsula commuter trains
out-bound from San Francisco were
halted at 4:20 Saturday afternoon and
remained idle yesterday when 64
switchmen crews of a normal 70
walked ofT the job.
Scrvicc from San Jose to San
Francisco continued yesterday, but
trains were bottling up in San
Francisco.
Failure of the switchmen to report
came in defiance of an order by a San
Francisco union official that* the SP
trainmen end their "unauthorized
work stoppage." Striking switchmen
arc on "sick" leave.
Roy A. Clapes, chief clerk at
the Palo Alto SP office, said ap
proximately 12,000 Peninsula
week-day commuters are affected,
and that ticket sales have fallen
off by 75 per cent.
Local SP officials met yesterday to
discuss operation of the 28 Peninsula
commuter trains under strike con
ditions, according to Clapes.
A Sixth Army spokesman said the
walkout has caused "a definite re
tarding of the movement of military
supplies" to the Far East command.
He said while the situation is "not
critical," promised delivery dates to
overseas installations probably can
not be met.
Railway Express shipments from
(he Palo Alto office for points cast
of Chicago were not being accepted
Friday, and other shipments were
being taken "subject to delay."
Seven employees of the local office
;:tand to lose their jobs temporarily
today barring immediate settlement
of the strike, according to Agent
James P. Mannix.
Anxious commuters flooded the
Palo Alto SP office with 400 phone
calls beginning at 5 a.m. Friday.
Southern Pacific announced that
for the duration of the strike "our
first efforts will lie directed to the
service of the country in the na
tional emergency."
The company's next immediate
concern will be to try to "serve the
need of our commuters and other
customers here at home."
Nationally, the strike by 10,000
members of the Rrothcrhood of
Railroad Trainmen has thrown
170,000 men out of work, brought
on one of the most drastic mail em -
bargocs in history, and struck nt
the heart of the defense program
by rinsing steel mills, automotive
plants, and other factories.

Nationally, the strike by 10,000
members of the Rrothcrhood of
Railroad Trainmen has thrown
170,000 men out of work, brought

bargocs in history, and struck nt

plants, and other factories.
The Southern Pacific Railroad
announced last night that 17
small commuter trains were set
to make the Peninsula run from
San Jose to San Francisco this

Commuter trains will return from
San Francisco to San Jose in the eve
ning, officials said, only if San Fran
cisco yard crews report to work today
for the 8 a.m. shift.

out-bound from San Francisco were
halted at 4:20 Saturday afternoon and
remained idle yesterday when 64
switchmen crews of a normal 70
walked ofT the job.
Scrvicc from San Jose to San
Francisco continued yesterday, but
trains were bottling up in San
Francisco.
Failure of the switchmen to report
came in defiance of an order by a San
Francisco union official that* the SP
trainmen end their "unauthorized
work stoppage." Striking switchmen
arc on "sick" leave.

the Palo Alto SP office, said ap
proximately 12,000 Peninsula
week-day commuters are affected,

off by 75 per cent.
Local SP officials met yesterday to
discuss operation of the 28 Peninsula
commuter trains under strike con
ditions, according to Clapes.

overseas installations probably can
not be met.
Railway Express shipments from
(he Palo Alto office for points cast

first efforts will lie directed to the
service of the country in the na
tional emergency."

concern will be to try to "serve the
need of our commuters and other
customers here at home."
