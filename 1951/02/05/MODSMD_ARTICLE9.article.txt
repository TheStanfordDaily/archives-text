The three plays to be presented
are "Any Number Will Do," "Angel
of the Lord," and "One Hundred
Acres and a Man."
"Angel of the Lord" was writ
ten by Peter Emmet and will be di
rected by Ed Linck, seen this week
end as the lawyer Huld in "The
Trial." The play is a poetic satire on
super-sophisticated people. It tells
of the cocktail party encounter of a
college - age man of deep - rooted
moral convictions with a crowd of
superficial and false socialites, and
his subsequent disillusionment.
"Any Number Will Do," by Ray
Barrett, a graduate student in the
Speech and Drama Department, is
by contrast a light comedy. It will
be directed by John Brebner. The
sequence of events that occurs when
a bored young girl picks up the
telephone and dials an invented
phone number in order to get a date
is humorously described in this play.
Rounding out the production will
be a farce on hillbillies in the Chero
kee territory, "One Hundred Acres
and a Man." Author is Keith Fisk,
who graduated last quarter from
Stanford. Roy Benjamin will direct
this play, described by the author as
"Being a Gentle Farce of the Chero
kee Strip, Contrived for the Amuse
ment and Edification of the Whole
Family, and Containing Sin, Sex, and
Song, for Those Interested in Such,
and a Rendition from the HOLY
BIBLE for Those Who Are Not."
