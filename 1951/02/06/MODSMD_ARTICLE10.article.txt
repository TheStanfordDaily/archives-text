### ROY HEMMING 
Robert Casadesus, perform
ing last night in the Memorial
Auditorium, presented an im
pressive display of technical
skill and interpretive insight
into a varied program of piano
music.
The sheer virtuosity of his per
formance would in itself have mer
ited the enthusiasm he evoked
among a capacity audience.
Mr. Casadesus opened his pro
gram with Rameau's "Gavotte Va
riee," then played Bach's "Italian
Concerto," turning next to the con
trasting moods of Schumann's "Car
naval."
In all of these works he showed
Competition
that he can alter a rhythm with the
same subtlety that he can color a
tone.
In the Andante of the Bach con
certo Mr. Casadesus had consid
erable competition from several
coughing members of the audience
who did little to muffle their dis
turbances.
Once started, the coughing seemed
to move like a chain reaction
throughout orchestra and balcony—
and thereby almost completely mar
red hearing of the soloist's superb
playing. ,
When he came to three short
works by Chopin, Mr. Casadesus in
jected considerable feeling and sen
timent into them, but always main
tained proportion and good taste—
something one does not always hear
with Chopin.
Sensitivity
But it was in Ravel's "Jeux d'eau,"
"Forlane," and "Toccata" that Mr.
Casadesus brought forth tho most
memorable sounds of the evening.
He played these pieces with sensi
tive gradations and nuances, all pos
sible tone color, and, when required,
the greatest of speed and accuracy.
For encores, Mr. Casadesus offered
two Debussy works, "Puerta del
Vino" and "General Laviene Eccen
trique."
Alter the concert Mr. Casadesus
said, in answer to a question as to
how he pronounces his name, that
there are about six or seven ways
but that they all should come out
like "Casa-day-su."
