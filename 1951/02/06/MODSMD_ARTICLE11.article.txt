# Mechanical Snake Counts Cars

### 

THE MECHANICAL AGE—The Palo Alto police station's mechanical traffic counter seems to
be doing a better job than the above Stanford student when it comes to counting cars. The me
chanical counter was used yesterday at Palm Drive where a traffic float check was conducted.
The check was authorized by the City Engineer's office and was conducted at other Palo Alto
I intersections. The data gathered is for statistical use. — Daily photo by John Thompson
