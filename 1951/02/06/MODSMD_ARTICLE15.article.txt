### DIANE JESSEN 
"I can't imagine leaving Stan
ford for any other university."
This was the sentiment Dr.
Clarence H. Faust expressed as
his resignation as Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences was an
nounced to the campus today.
Dr. Faust smiled as he fingered a
cigarette and leaned back in his
brown leather chair.
"Stanford's opportunities as a
great private university on the West
Coast are almost boundless. And I've
found if is an extremely happy placc
not only to be in, but to work in," he
continued.
Dr. Faust explained he was leav
ing Stanford because his post in the
educational field with Ford Founda
tion is a challenge to meet the pres
ent educational crisis on a larger
scale.
"The present strain on manpower
and resources and the necessity of
rapid specialization is an educational
problem," he said. He reached over
to light the cigarette, and asked:
Educational Squeeze?
"Will we be squeezing out liberal
or general education?"
Those who have worker! with Dr.
Faust in revising the lower division
program well know he considers both
specialized know-how and general
curriculum important for long-term,
health in a democracy.
Dr. Faust said the lower division
curriculum committee, which has
been studying the present program
for two years, will make its final
report on suggested revisions this
quarter.
Hefoinmendntions of the commit
tee, which are expected to broaden
the scope of the present program,
will will be voted on by the Faculty
Council. The Council is composed of
all faculty members holding an as
sistant professorship or above.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of stu
dents and co-chairman of the com
mittee, will continue to head the
committee after Dr. Faust leaves.
The committee's entire objective
in revising the lower division pro
gram has been to widen general ed
ucation so students will have an in
telligent understanding of social and
political problems and appreciation
of our heritage in art and literature.
"This is the kind of education ev
ery citizen in a democracy ought to

have," Dr. Faust declared. "It is the
broad base education ought to pro
vide, regardless of the particular
area in which the student will spe
cialize."
Faust Approves Rating
Dr. Faust also expressed approval
of the Student-Faculty Rating Com
mittee. He believes the rating sheets
will be helpful on a voluntary basis
if the instructor and committee can
discuss problems without forcing
opinions on the professor or devel
oping a popularity contest.
He contended that while the fac
ulty has competence in the subject
matter of a course, students know
what, goes on and can contribute to
procedural methods.
Dr. Faust thinks the rating com
mittee can be used as a channel to
help smooth functioning of the new
lower division program when it goes
into effect, probably a year from this
fall.
He declined to give details of the
revision at this time.
