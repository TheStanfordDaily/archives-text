# Dean Faust and the Students
## 
### 
For the second time in 10 months, Stanford
•students will lose one of their best friends.
Last June, Dean of Students Lawrence A.
"Cirnpton left the Stanford Family for the Uni
versity of Chicago. In the short, three-year
.span of his administration here, Dean Kimpton
did an outstanding job of "bridging the gap"
between students and administration.
Because he did such a fine job, the Dean's
onds and ideas did not depart with him. As
students from the Men's and Women's Rows,
he eating clubs, the dorms, and student gov
ernment will tell you, the Dean is very much
ilive today in the persons of his own former
issistants—Mr. Richard Balch and Miss Adele
Btrogen, Men's and Women's Counselors.
Jn a little more than a month, Clarence A.
?aust, Dean of Humanities and Sciences, will
Leave for the Ford Foundation's main office in
Pasadena. There he will work for "the further
development of university resources for re
search in individual behavior and human rela
tions."
What the Dean has started here at Stanford
we know he will further to even greater heights
with the Foundation. More than that, what
Dean' Faust has already achieved here at Stan
ford is sure to live after him and bear sweet
!ruit in the immediate years ahead.
What has the Dean tried to do? In his own
field, he has done the same kind of thing that
Dean Kimpton did so successfully. Unlike the
former dean, however, who worked with stu
dents and administration, Dean Faust has con
sistently attempted in his own three years to
bring about a better understanding between
you and I, our professors, and our goals in edu
cation.
A staunch supporter of the Student-Faculty

Education Commission — and activities of a
similar nature—Dean Faust has co-chairmaned,
for over two years, a committee to revise
Lower Division requirements.
And although he agrees wholeheartedly
with the Stanford plan of a broad and general
education in the initial years of college life, the
Dean has not failed to keep up the search for
a worthwhile peg upon which to hang that edu
cation.
Last year, he helped bring to Stanford the
Graduate Record Examinations, which were
taken by every Stanford junior to determine
the degrees of knowledge attained in each of a
wide range of subjects.
Following these tests, he was instrumental in
the formation of a Stanford exam, taken by a
smaller group of juniors, that measured student
attainment along even broader lines, such as
the student's ability to appreciate fine litera
ture, art, and scientific achievement.
This year, working with the revision com
mittee, the Dean has started fitting data-pieces
into the overall goal of preparing better men
and women for life in the democratic state, his
educational "peg."
Using the broad education theme as a foun
dation, the committee has laid plans for build
ing upwards with the powerful blocks of
Graduate Record results, Stanford's own test
results, and those of student-faculty discus
sions and rating systems, just now coming
into their own.
By Fall quarter, 1952, the Dean hopes the re
visions will be underway.
When they are, we would all do well to take
time out to remember the man who helped
"bridge the gap" and make them possible—
Dean Clarence Faust.
