Dear Sir:
This morning I called your office to report a very
regrettable incident which occurred in our place last
Thursday night (Jan. 18) between 12 p.m. and 1 a.m.
(A group of boys) . . . from Stanford University . . .
left about 1 a.m. taking with them a large framed
newspaper clipping which tells my life in show busi
ness. On top of the story was a photograph with my
name. . . .
. . . this document is precious to me (and) is cer
tainly no good to anyone else. If one of these so-called
gentlemen took it as a souvenir. 1 would appreciate
getting it back. . . .
. . . they also did a very bad tiling ... to let the
air out of the tire of the bartender's car . . . this is
not tile first time a bad thing like this has happened
here.
Everything you may do to help me recover this per
onal document will be more than appreciated.

(In her letter. Miss Martine mentioned thiit one of
the reasons for "leaving" with the document might

have been the bartender's refusal to serve "some of
the boys because they looked under age." Regard
less of what the facts are or might be concerning
this matter, Miss Marline is out one framed, senti
mental object which common sense requires be re
turned to her.—the Editor.)
