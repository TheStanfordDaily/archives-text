# A 						Thank You Note

To the Editor:
If the co-operation and consequent success of the
International Dinner last Saturday is any criterion of
the way foreigners and Americans, students and fac
ulty. can work together, then there is hope in these
troubled times.
Special thanks go to Harriot Veltman and the
"cooks" from China, France, Germany, Holland,
India, and' Turkey for the fine food; to Bernd Sandt
and the entertainers for the lively songs and dances;
to Werner Kubsch for decorations; to Ted Collier for
tickets and publicity; and to Dean and Mrs. Waterous
arid Col. and Mrs. Collier for being patrons and pa
tronesses.
At this time we of International Club would like to
remind interested students, from here and abroad,
that they are always invited to I Club affairs.
Thanks again to all contributors.
CAROLYN AIKEN
