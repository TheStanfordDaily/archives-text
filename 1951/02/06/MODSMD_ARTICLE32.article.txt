# Songs, Dances For Con Home
## 
### 
Excom's newest subcommittee —
the Con Home Entertainment Com
mittee, whose members-to-be will
"entertain the kids" monthly at the
Stanford Convalescent Home — will
hold a general meeting tonight at
7:30 in the courtroom of the Worn
i en's Clubhouse.
The announcement was made by
Chairman Fred Chez, who has in
vited all students with singing, act
ing, dancing, or impersonation tal
ents to attend.
"As a matter of fact," Chez com
mented, "we're interested in anyone
i with a flair for putting on a good
j show for 'the kids,' and who is will
ing to spend two hours a month do
ing it."
Chairman Chez said the first en
tertainment program will be held
Friday afternoon, Feb. IG, at the
Home. At that time, and at the re
mainder of the programs, he said,
candy will be given away to the
j convalescents.
The Con Home is supported by
charitable donations from the ASSU,
the University proper, members of
the Stanford Family, and others. Its
j patient list is made up largely of
! bed - ridden youngsters — most of
them under 12 —who cannot afford
the otherwise high costs of recuper
ation from illnesses.
