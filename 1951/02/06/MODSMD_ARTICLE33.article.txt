Three members of the Stanford
faculty have been co-operating for
the past year with the California
Senate Fact-Finding Committee on
Establishing a Port Authority for
San Francisco Bay.
The committee has just recently
submitted a preliminary report sup
porting the introduction of legisla
tion at Sacramento that would es
tablish a temporary Port Develop
ment Commission for the San Fran
cisco Bay Area to work with the
fact-finding committee.
The preliminary report mentions
the "especially helpful" work of
Professor Carl E. McDowell of the
Graduate School of Business, and
the "invaluable service" as research
and editorial assistant of Miss Helen
Gibbs, formerly with the Business
School.
Dr. Paul E. Anderson of the School
of Law also served as a consultant
and adviser to the Senate Committee
and prepared an analysis of the au
thorities and functions of various
port managements in the United
States.
