I With Chuck Taylor becoming the latest link in a long chain of illustrious
j Indian coaches, might be worth while to review who some of the others
were. A run-down of the last sounds like an all-time gridiron Who's Who.
Walter Camp, Fielding "Hurry-Up" Yost, Andy Kerr, Glenn "Pop" Warner.
Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill, and Clark D. Shaughnessy.

01 all of these, "Pop" Warner might well be the greatest. There was the
time when his Carlisle Indians tangled with Alonzo Stagg's Chicago squad.
Carlisle that year had an outstanding passing combination, with Mauser
doing the pitching, and Gardner the catching. .
Stagg figured that if he could put enough men covering Gardner, Chicago
would stop the Carlisle attack. So wherever Gardner went, there were three
Chic ago players climbing up his back.
For a while this worked fine, and Chicago seemed to have done the im
possible by stopping.the mighty Indians. Then "Pop" Warner called time
out and held a hasty consultation with his players. •
A couple of plays later Gardner took off. Cutting to the sidelines with
his three shadows hanging on, he stepped out of bounds and kept right on
running. Luring his pursuers along, he raced behind the Chicago bench.
And while the slightly startled Chicago players were falling all over each
other and their teammates, Gardner cut back onto the field, caught Hau
ler's pass, and went over the goal line with nobody near him.
''Pop" Warner came to Stanford in 1924. On Jan. 1. 1925. the Indians took
their first official trio to the Rose Bowl. They were beaten by Notre Dame,
27 to 10, but gave the Irish a game that they've still not forgotten. With
Ernie Nevers and Jim Lawson leading the way, the Cards outplayed and
out-distanced Knute Rockne's famed Four Horsemen. But the breaks were
against them and they couldn't win. The turning point came when the
Indians were stopped 4 inches short of the Notre Dame goal line, after
having taken an early lead.
But "Pop" was far from through, and Stanford went back to the Rose
Bowl in 1927 and in 1928, tying Alabama, 7 to 7, and beating Pittsburgh,
7 to (5. to bring the Indians the national stature that they've kept to this day.

Ai •oniid the circuit .. . Score of the basketball game in S.F. Examiner:
Knox 00, Chicago Si. No doubt that game was thrown. Cheapest bas
ketball fix in history . . . Highest score of the year came down in Texas
as Rio Grande College beat Wilberforce Church U., 118 to 116 . . . But it'll
be a long time before any team beats the score racked up by Georgia Tech
one afternoon. 222 points against Centre. And they were only playing foot
ball! . . . Largest number of overtime periods this season was registered
in a game between the New York Knickerbockers and Rochster, as the pros
needed four extra stanzas to settle the issue . . . NCAA statistics show that
in basketball the home teams win 70 per cent of the games . . . And two
nights after Oklahoma upset Okla. A&M. 44 to 40, in basketball, the Sooners i
did it again against the Aggies, this time in wrestling. It was the first
wrestling meet Okla. A&M had lost in 14 years of competition. Beat that
for a streak!

''Pop" Warner came to Stanford in 1924. On Jan. 1. 1925. the Indians took
their first official trio to the Rose Bowl. They were beaten by Notre Dame,
27 to 10, but gave the Irish a game that they've still not forgotten. With
Ernie Nevers and Jim Lawson leading the way, the Cards outplayed and
out-distanced Knute Rockne's famed Four Horsemen. But the breaks were
against them and they couldn't win. The turning point came when the
Indians were stopped 4 inches short of the Notre Dame goal line, after
having taken an early lead.
But "Pop" was far from through, and Stanford went back to the Rose
Bowl in 1927 and in 1928, tying Alabama, 7 to 7, and beating Pittsburgh,
7 to (5. to bring the Indians the national stature that they've kept to this day.

Ai •oniid the circuit .. . Score of the basketball game in S.F. Examiner:
Knox 00, Chicago Si. No doubt that game was thrown. Cheapest bas
ketball fix in history . . . Highest score of the year came down in Texas
as Rio Grande College beat Wilberforce Church U., 118 to 116 . . . But it'll
be a long time before any team beats the score racked up by Georgia Tech
one afternoon. 222 points against Centre. And they were only playing foot
ball! . . . Largest number of overtime periods this season was registered
in a game between the New York Knickerbockers and Rochster, as the pros
needed four extra stanzas to settle the issue . . . NCAA statistics show that
in basketball the home teams win 70 per cent of the games . . . And two
nights after Oklahoma upset Okla. A&M. 44 to 40, in basketball, the Sooners i
did it again against the Aggies, this time in wrestling. It was the first
wrestling meet Okla. A&M had lost in 14 years of competition. Beat that
for a streak!
I With Chuck Taylor becoming the latest link in a long chain of illustrious
j Indian coaches, might be worth while to review who some of the others
were. A run-down of the last sounds like an all-time gridiron Who's Who.
Walter Camp, Fielding "Hurry-Up" Yost, Andy Kerr, Glenn "Pop" Warner.
Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill, and Clark D. Shaughnessy.

01 all of these, "Pop" Warner might well be the greatest. There was the
time when his Carlisle Indians tangled with Alonzo Stagg's Chicago squad.
Carlisle that year had an outstanding passing combination, with Mauser
doing the pitching, and Gardner the catching. .
Stagg figured that if he could put enough men covering Gardner, Chicago
would stop the Carlisle attack. So wherever Gardner went, there were three
Chic ago players climbing up his back.
For a while this worked fine, and Chicago seemed to have done the im
possible by stopping.the mighty Indians. Then "Pop" Warner called time
out and held a hasty consultation with his players. •
A couple of plays later Gardner took off. Cutting to the sidelines with
his three shadows hanging on, he stepped out of bounds and kept right on
running. Luring his pursuers along, he raced behind the Chicago bench.
And while the slightly startled Chicago players were falling all over each
other and their teammates, Gardner cut back onto the field, caught Hau
ler's pass, and went over the goal line with nobody near him.
