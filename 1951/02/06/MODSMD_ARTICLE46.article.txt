THAT PARALLEL AGAIN—United Nations forces drove within
seven air miles of Seoul (1) and Allied troops were cheered by
Washington reports that they had been ordered to retake the
former capital, then push to the 38th parallel, where a defense
line would be set up. East of Seoul, a French-American combat
team was rescued from Red encirclement (cross mark) about
12 miles north of Yoju (2). Other Reds were beaten off in
counter-attacks above Suwon. —Acme Telephoto
