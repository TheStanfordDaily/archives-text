# President Wilbur, Wacs, Boarders Were Former Occupants of Knoll
## Music Staff Now at Knoll 
### 
By SHARLENE HOFFMAN
It's a long hike to the Knoll, as
anyone who has had a music
course can testify. But there's a
reason for it.
The reason is symmetry.
When the University built the
Knoll back in ll>l7 as a home for
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, the
site was carefully chosen so that the
large house would be symmetrical
with the Quad. Looking toward the
Quad from Palm Drive, the chim
neys of the building balance square
ly on each side behind the Memo
rial Church.
Opinions as to the beauty of the
Knoll range all the way from com
ments on the "architectural mon
strosity" to "distinguished looking."
But whatever your personal view,
Architect Louis Mullgardt designed
the Knoll in predominantly Spanish
Renaissance style because of old
Spanish traditions of California. The
style involves emphasis of surface
details, which Mullgardt achieved
with stucco and concrete poured and
colored to show new texture and
special effects.
But the ivy, now a prominent part
of the Knoll's appearance, was not
planned on by the designer. It just
"growed."
No Classes Till '4fi
The Knoll was not used for classes
until 1946, and many a tea-goer, faci
ulty member, and boarder preceded
the music student hiker on the well
trodden Knoll path.
President and Mrs. Wilbur regu
larly opened their home to students
and faculty. Receptions were infor
mal, in the Stanford tradition, and
guests gathered on the second-floor
back yard, where the French doors
opened into the house.
After Herbert Hoover gave his
home as a residence for the Univer

sity president, the Knoll was used to
house military personnel. The oc
casion was World War II and its ac
companying housing shortage. First
occupants were 40 WACs receiving
physical therapy training. After
their departure, Army officers
moved in. Still later, graduate wom
en moved in as boarders.
Boarding House, Too
The Music Department made its
first step into the Knoll in the fall
of 1946, But they were far from co
cupying the large portion of it that
they do now. The third fiooor was
still a boarding house, so the Music
Department was confined to the
second floor and part of the first.
The department had to remodel a
cloak room into a classroom, a stor
age room into a rehearsal room, and
the servants' bedrooms and the
laundry room into practice rooms.
When boarders finally left the
Knoll, the Math and Geography De
partments moved in. This quarter
these departments moved to the
temporary buildings, enabling the
Music Department to spread to the
top floor.
The Speech Clinic and the Music
Department are now the sole posses
sors of the Knoll. The Speech Clinic
does remedial work with Stanford

students, and holds teacher-training
classes in corrective speech.
Construction of the Music Listen
ing Room in the Main Library ex
tended the facilities of the Music De
partment beyond the boundaries of
the Knoll. They have also taken over
Woodpecker Lodge for chorus and
orchestra use, and this autumn a
practice organ and two pianos were
installed there. The choir room of
Memorial Church is used for chorus
rehearsals and classes.
Kuilding Remodeled
The Music Department undertook
extensive remodeling of the Knoll
this quarter. The teachers' offices
and the central departmental office
were transferred to the third floor.
A music library and a listening room
on the second floor replaced the for
mer dining and reception rooms. On
the first floor Edward E. Colby, mu
sic librarian, moved his office into an
ex-butler's pantry. A former kitch
en was converted into a graduate

study and seminar room, and the
ballroom is now a large classroom.
In the future, the Music Depart
ment hopes for one building in
which to consolidate all its activities.
Long - range University planning
schemes tentatively call for a music
building, possibly beside the Memo
rial Auditorium on the side facing
the BAC Building.
The building would contain a the
ater seating approximately 800 per
sons and could be used for concerts,
operas, and as a rehearsal hall for
large musical organizations. There
would also be classrooms and offices.
But at the present time, this build
ing is only a dream. When and if it
is built it will be a part of the gen
eral University expansion program
and will be built with University
funds.


HOUSE OF ALL TRADES—The Knoll was originally built in 1917 as a home for former Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. It has since served as a boarding house for graduate students, a
WAC dormitory, headquarters of the Math and Geography Departments, and finally, as the
home of the Music Department.

Long - range University planning

HOUSE OF ALL TRADES—The Knoll was originally built in 1917 as a home for former Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. It has since served as a boarding house for graduate students, a
WAC dormitory, headquarters of the Math and Geography Departments, and finally, as the
home of the Music Department.
By SHARLENE HOFFMAN
It's a long hike to the Knoll, as
anyone who has had a music
course can testify. But there's a
reason for it.
The reason is symmetry.
When the University built the
Knoll back in ll>l7 as a home for
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, the
site was carefully chosen so that the
large house would be symmetrical
with the Quad. Looking toward the
Quad from Palm Drive, the chim
neys of the building balance square
ly on each side behind the Memo
rial Church.
Opinions as to the beauty of the
Knoll range all the way from com
ments on the "architectural mon
strosity" to "distinguished looking."
But whatever your personal view,
Architect Louis Mullgardt designed
the Knoll in predominantly Spanish
Renaissance style because of old
Spanish traditions of California. The
style involves emphasis of surface
details, which Mullgardt achieved
with stucco and concrete poured and
colored to show new texture and
special effects.
But the ivy, now a prominent part
of the Knoll's appearance, was not
planned on by the designer. It just
"growed."
No Classes Till '4fi
The Knoll was not used for classes
until 1946, and many a tea-goer, faci
ulty member, and boarder preceded
the music student hiker on the well
trodden Knoll path.
President and Mrs. Wilbur regu
larly opened their home to students
and faculty. Receptions were infor
mal, in the Stanford tradition, and
guests gathered on the second-floor
back yard, where the French doors
opened into the house.
After Herbert Hoover gave his
home as a residence for the Univer

sity president, the Knoll was used to
house military personnel. The oc
casion was World War II and its ac
companying housing shortage. First
occupants were 40 WACs receiving
physical therapy training. After
their departure, Army officers
moved in. Still later, graduate wom
en moved in as boarders.
Boarding House, Too
The Music Department made its
first step into the Knoll in the fall
of 1946, But they were far from co
cupying the large portion of it that
they do now. The third fiooor was
still a boarding house, so the Music
Department was confined to the
second floor and part of the first.
The department had to remodel a
cloak room into a classroom, a stor
age room into a rehearsal room, and
the servants' bedrooms and the
laundry room into practice rooms.
When boarders finally left the
Knoll, the Math and Geography De
partments moved in. This quarter
these departments moved to the
temporary buildings, enabling the
Music Department to spread to the
top floor.
The Speech Clinic and the Music
Department are now the sole posses
sors of the Knoll. The Speech Clinic
does remedial work with Stanford

students, and holds teacher-training
classes in corrective speech.
Construction of the Music Listen
ing Room in the Main Library ex
tended the facilities of the Music De
partment beyond the boundaries of
the Knoll. They have also taken over
Woodpecker Lodge for chorus and
orchestra use, and this autumn a
practice organ and two pianos were
installed there. The choir room of
Memorial Church is used for chorus
rehearsals and classes.
Kuilding Remodeled
The Music Department undertook
extensive remodeling of the Knoll
this quarter. The teachers' offices
and the central departmental office
were transferred to the third floor.
A music library and a listening room
on the second floor replaced the for
mer dining and reception rooms. On

does remedial work with Stanford

students, and holds teacher-training
classes in corrective speech.
Construction of the Music Listen
ing Room in the Main Library ex
tended the facilities of the Music De
partment beyond the boundaries of
the Knoll. They have also taken over
Woodpecker Lodge for chorus and
orchestra use, and this autumn a
practice organ and two pianos were
installed there. The choir room of
Memorial Church is used for chorus
rehearsals and classes.
Kuilding Remodeled
The Music Department undertook
extensive remodeling of the Knoll
this quarter. The teachers' offices
and the central departmental office
were transferred to the third floor.
A music library and a listening room
on the second floor replaced the for
mer dining and reception rooms. On
the first floor Edward E. Colby, mu
sic librarian, moved his office into an
ex-butler's pantry. A former kitch
en was converted into a graduate

study and seminar room, and the
ballroom is now a large classroom.
In the future, the Music Depart
ment hopes for one building in
which to consolidate all its activities.
Long - range University planning
schemes tentatively call for a music
building, possibly beside the Memo
rial Auditorium on the side facing
the BAC Building.
The building would contain a the
ater seating approximately 800 per
sons and could be used for concerts,
operas, and as a rehearsal hall for
large musical organizations. There
would also be classrooms and offices.
But at the present time, this build
ing is only a dream. When and if it
is built it will be a part of the gen
eral University expansion program
and will be built with University
funds.


HOUSE OF ALL TRADES—The Knoll was originally built in 1917 as a home for former Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. It has since served as a boarding house for graduate students, a
WAC dormitory, headquarters of the Math and Geography Departments, and finally, as the
home of the Music Department.
By SHARLENE HOFFMAN
It's a long hike to the Knoll, as
anyone who has had a music
course can testify. But there's a
reason for it.
The reason is symmetry.
When the University built the
Knoll back in ll>l7 as a home for
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, the
site was carefully chosen so that the
large house would be symmetrical
with the Quad. Looking toward the
Quad from Palm Drive, the chim
neys of the building balance square
ly on each side behind the Memo
rial Church.
Opinions as to the beauty of the
Knoll range all the way from com
ments on the "architectural mon
strosity" to "distinguished looking."
But whatever your personal view,
Architect Louis Mullgardt designed
the Knoll in predominantly Spanish
Renaissance style because of old
Spanish traditions of California. The
style involves emphasis of surface
details, which Mullgardt achieved
with stucco and concrete poured and
colored to show new texture and
special effects.
But the ivy, now a prominent part
of the Knoll's appearance, was not
planned on by the designer. It just
"growed."
No Classes Till '4fi
The Knoll was not used for classes
until 1946, and many a tea-goer, faci
ulty member, and boarder preceded
the music student hiker on the well
trodden Knoll path.
President and Mrs. Wilbur regu
larly opened their home to students
and faculty. Receptions were infor
mal, in the Stanford tradition, and
guests gathered on the second-floor
back yard, where the French doors
opened into the house.
After Herbert Hoover gave his
home as a residence for the Univer

sity president, the Knoll was used to
house military personnel. The oc
casion was World War II and its ac
companying housing shortage. First
occupants were 40 WACs receiving
physical therapy training. After
their departure, Army officers
moved in. Still later, graduate wom
en moved in as boarders.
Boarding House, Too
The Music Department made its
first step into the Knoll in the fall
of 1946, But they were far from co
cupying the large portion of it that
they do now. The third fiooor was
still a boarding house, so the Music
Department was confined to the
second floor and part of the first.
The department had to remodel a
cloak room into a classroom, a stor
age room into a rehearsal room, and
the servants' bedrooms and the
laundry room into practice rooms.
When boarders finally left the
Knoll, the Math and Geography De
partments moved in. This quarter
these departments moved to the
temporary buildings, enabling the
Music Department to spread to the
top floor.
