# Advising System For LD Changed
## Poll Shows Students Are Unhappy With Set-Up Now 
### 
The Student-Faculty Educational Commission has approved a
series of recommendations on changes to be made in the Lower
Division Advising system.
The recommendations were drawn up last week by a sub-com
mittee on Lower Division advising on the basis of a poll taken

last December. The Educational
Commission appointed four students,
Fred Firestone, Joan Fish, Buff Har
ris, and Hal Rogers, to assist Dr. Har
vey Hall in carrying out the details
of the program throughout the year.
Dr. Hall is University Registrar.
The first suggestion made by the
committee was that a pamphlet of in
formation on advising be prepared
for the faculty. The poll, which cov
ered a random five per cent of the
student body, showed that 60 per
cent of those interviewed felt that
faculty advisors were not well
enough informed on Lower Division
courses.

Clarify Functions

A second recommendation was
that the aims and functions of ad
vising be clarified for the students.

This could be done through the
"Frosh Bible," the sponsors, and a
more infoxmative Announcement of
Courses. The committee also felt
that special publicity should be given
to the fact that students may change
advisers at any time, said Bud Mc-
Cord, chairman.
A resolution was passed that "spe- j
cial care should be exercised in selec
tion of advisers." The committee
realized that faculty members
achieve promotion and prominence
mainly through research work, and j
that advising consumes much time. I
Nevertheless it believes "that the i
pressing need of younger students for
friendly counsel" should be recog
nized and supported.
Non-scholastic Problems
Fifty-two per cent of the students
polled thought advisors lack in
terest in the student's problems.
Forty per cent specified that they j
want advice on non-scholastic prob
lems. A recommendation was there
fore made that more emphasis be '
placed on career and personal prob
lems.
A fifth suggestion, supported by 95
per cent in the poll, states that stu
dents should get advisers in their
field of interest. This is a mechanical
problem that will be tackled by hav
ing the freshmen state their probable i
major and their general field of in- |
terest (science, humanities, etc.).
Although the committee unani
mously voted down a proposal to re
quire two student-adviser meetings i
per quarter, it definitely felt that ad
visers should actively encourage stu
dents to come with any problem at I
any time. The poll showed that 53
per cent want more than one confer
ence in a quarter.
Revaluation Committee
Finally the committee recom- i
j mended that freshmen should be
j given academic information earlier !
in the orientation week, and that a
revaluation committee be set up next j
i year. This committee would review
the above suggestions and study the |
improvements made in the advising !
system.
The students interviewed in the
poll were selected at random from
the Directory and were in both Upper
; and Lower Division. In a* general
| judgment on the Lower Division ad
vising system at present, 40 per cent
j thought it fair, while 34 per cent
I thought it very poor.
The remaining percentage was di
| vidod between excellent and poor.
i The students felt that the defects
I were not inherent in the system it
self, but were rather the fault of
I individual advisors.
