# Pioneering Success In S.E. Asia Told
## 
### 
Dr. E. H. G. Dobby presented the "success story" of Southeast
Asia to a Tuesday Evening Series audience last night, likening
the pioneer spirit of that area during the past century and its im
pact on Asia, to the United States' position in the Wesern world.
"Raher than wring your hearts with a sob story of penury, I'm

going to speak of the successful
meeting of a challenge," Dr. Dobby
said in introduction.
Localizing his discussion of South
east Asia on Malaya, Dr. Dobby out
lined the foreign development of
that area under British rule.
Dr. Dobby cited the rubber tree,
sugar, and coffee as prime examples
of the introduction of foreign agri
culture and techniques to Asia.
A "bonanza" that had later politi
cal and social repercussions was the
discovery of readily accessible tin
ore and the resulting "Tin Rush" of
1850.
"By 1950, the Chinese looked to
Malaya as the United States did to
the Klondike in the 'Nineties," Dr.
Dobby said.
Another form of pioneering in Ma
laya has taken the form of political
experimentation with the introduc
tion of elected constitutional gov
ernments, a completely foreign con
ception, according to Dr. Dobby.
"The story of Malaya is a remark
able success story that is an inevi
table and natural extension of the
new economic and agricultural tech
niques and political conceptions in
troduced by the West," Dr. Dobby
stated.
"I sec Malaya as one of the few
places in Asia with a stake in the
.Western world. One may think of
Malaya as a British colony adminis
tratively but as an American colony
economically. Dr. Dobby concluded.
