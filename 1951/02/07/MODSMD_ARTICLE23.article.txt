TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 7
(UP) â€”Groggy Chinese Commu
nists defending Seoul have fal
len back five and one-half miles
under withering United Nations
blows, it was disclosed today, as
American armor speared to
within six miles of the city.
The enemy forces dug in for a final
stand less than six miles from the
Han River, which flows through the
south edge of Seoul, after withdraw
ing before a solid wall of blasting
tanks and artillery. Their new de
fense positions were in the mountain
area just below the city.
80-Mile Front
UN forces rammed forward as far
as four miles on their 80-mile front
yesterday, and an Bth Army spokes
man said they had inflicted an esti
mated 7,137 casualties during the day.
As the Allied offensive entered its
14th day the spokesman said the
Chinese definitely had been knocked
out of their main line of resistance.
But he said they intend to make a
determined defense of Seoul.
On the east edge of the western
sector 11 miles northeast of Inchon
air observers reported a "general
mass movement" of enemy troops to
ward the Han River. The Commu
nists were withdrawing in groups of
from 10 to 20, apparently to avoid
devastating Allied air attacks.
Han River Stand
The Army spokesman said the
Communists had bolstered their po
sitions along the Han River with the
intention of making a determined
stand to defend Seoul.
Earlier reports said U.S. Armored
Forces rolled back the hard fighting
Communist flank four miles yester
day in the area southwest of Seoul to
straighten the Allied line.
The communique said that 109 ene
my dead and 256 fresh graves were
found after the UN forces seized Hill
431. The hill was taken without op
position, but earlier an estimated
enemy battalion has repulsed efforts
to capture it.
