# BULL SESSION

### VIC PALMIERI 
I see where they're having the Student-Faculty
Talent Show Friday night. This is a Stanford tradi
tion but deserves to be supported nonetheless. Where
else can you laugh at a professor and not be called
on to recite?
Oddly enough, 1 wasn't asked to perform. This

lurts . . . especially after all the
ime I spent tuning my Casadesus.
But I guess talent shows just
iien't in my line. I've got talent,
but it doesn't show.
1 understand they have some
very fine acts lined up, however.
For instance, one of my profs is
.',oirig to do the mad scene from
King Lear. He should be very

pood. He volunteered right after reading my last
paper.
Another faculty group will present a takeoff on
Orehesis. This should be very interesting. How much
of a takeoff can you do in those costumes?
But what I'm really looking forward to most is hear-

ing my favorite prof tell some of his funny stories. (He
really isn't my favorite prof, and his stories aren't
really funny, but the more he tells Friday night, the
less he'll have lgi't to tell in class.)
This show will have everything . . . juggling, danc
ing. singing . . . which reminds me of the one about
the music critic who took seasick pills to the Mar
garet Truman concert ... he was afraid he'd get ill
when she hit the high seas (. . . that's my own ... I
made it up! Hah, hah . . . what a joke!)
Obviously, however, the whole point of a show like
Ibis is to present to the campus tflfe proposition that
professors are human. Anyone who won't pay one
buck to see that proved is obviously either an edu
cation major or jus) plumb uncurious.
And don't tell me you don't have one buck. After
all. we are STANFORD STUDENTS, and we do come
from well-heeled, Republican families . . . (if you
hear someone sobbing in the background, it's my
father).
But I'm still sore they didn't give me a chance to
perform. I'm actually a terrific entertainer. Ask my
girl. She says I'm always making a scene.

But what I'm really looking forward to most is hear-

ing my favorite prof tell some of his funny stories. (He
really isn't my favorite prof, and his stories aren't
really funny, but the more he tells Friday night, the
less he'll have lgi't to tell in class.)
This show will have everything . . . juggling, danc
ing. singing . . . which reminds me of the one about
the music critic who took seasick pills to the Mar
garet Truman concert ... he was afraid he'd get ill
when she hit the high seas (. . . that's my own ... I
made it up! Hah, hah . . . what a joke!)
Obviously, however, the whole point of a show like
Ibis is to present to the campus tflfe proposition that
professors are human. Anyone who won't pay one
buck to see that proved is obviously either an edu
cation major or jus) plumb uncurious.
And don't tell me you don't have one buck. After
all. we are STANFORD STUDENTS, and we do come
from well-heeled, Republican families . . . (if you
hear someone sobbing in the background, it's my
father).
But I'm still sore they didn't give me a chance to
perform. I'm actually a terrific entertainer. Ask my
girl. She says I'm always making a scene.
