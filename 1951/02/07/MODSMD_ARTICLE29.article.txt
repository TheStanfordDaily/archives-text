### GEORGE STEWART 
ONWARD TO BUENAVENTURA, COLOMBIA—
All sails were set and drawing admirably as wo raced
along out of the channel propelled by the last furious
.spurt of the Caribbean Trades, doomed to die in the
Pacific.
It was at this point that an incident occurred which

could have ended the cruise in
tragedy—all because of the inat
tention and thoughtlessnes of one
person. This is roughly the order
of events:
"It looks like a ship out there
off our starboard bow, Skipper."
• ailed the watchstander.
"'And coming our way," added
Skipper. "Break out the spot-

light, Jay, and we'll give him a blast just in case he
doesn't realize we're under sail."
(1 should mention that all ships under sail have
the right of way under international "rules of the
road." This is because sailing vessels can't change
course suddenly without damage to their own sailing
gear. Sudden changes in wind pressure would carry
away the sails and possibly the top mast.)
But the spotlight didn't do any good. First it was
beamed on the approaching ship, then on our own
.sails—and still the vessel bore down upon us, crossing
from our starboard to port side. Most alarming was

the fact that as the ship got closer and closer, its
bearing from us didn't change—a sure sign of a col
lision course.
"Shine that thing on those fools again," ordered
Skipper, in more agitated tones. Now the ship was
about 100 yards away, its red port running light
practically illuminating our sails in the darkness.
"Quickly, Steve, find the Hare gun in the after deck
house. Someone's asleep at the wheel on that thing."
By this time we could recognize the menacing
freighter as one belonging to the United Fruit Com
pany, which has a large business in the Caribbean.
Sudenly, when a scant 200 feet of water stood
hetween us and a collision, brain cells in the freight
er's wheelhouse made a snap decision—the wrong
one. The big ship started veering starply to star
hoard instead of port. The big white vessel de
scribed an arc across our bow and slithered by our
bowsprit with but yards to spare.
In exasperation, Skipper yelled up to the bridge now
towering above us, "Where the hell do you think
you're going." No answer.
If Steve had gotten the flare gun out in tune,
Skipper swears he would've fired it at the wheel
house instead of across the vessel's bow.)
But now that it was all over, everyone not on watch
hurried below to add this latest piece of adventure
to his personal records of the voyage, leaving Skipper
sputtering on deck.

It was at this point that an incident occurred which

could have ended the cruise in
tragedy—all because of the inat
tention and thoughtlessnes of one
person. This is roughly the order
of events:
"It looks like a ship out there
off our starboard bow, Skipper."
• ailed the watchstander.
"'And coming our way," added
Skipper. "Break out the spot-

light, Jay, and we'll give him a blast just in case he
doesn't realize we're under sail."
(1 should mention that all ships under sail have
the right of way under international "rules of the
road." This is because sailing vessels can't change
course suddenly without damage to their own sailing
gear. Sudden changes in wind pressure would carry
away the sails and possibly the top mast.)
But the spotlight didn't do any good. First it was
beamed on the approaching ship, then on our own
.sails—and still the vessel bore down upon us, crossing
from our starboard to port side. Most alarming was

the fact that as the ship got closer and closer, its
bearing from us didn't change—a sure sign of a col
lision course.
"Shine that thing on those fools again," ordered
Skipper, in more agitated tones. Now the ship was
about 100 yards away, its red port running light
practically illuminating our sails in the darkness.
"Quickly, Steve, find the Hare gun in the after deck
house. Someone's asleep at the wheel on that thing."
By this time we could recognize the menacing
freighter as one belonging to the United Fruit Com
pany, which has a large business in the Caribbean.
Sudenly, when a scant 200 feet of water stood
hetween us and a collision, brain cells in the freight
er's wheelhouse made a snap decision—the wrong
one. The big ship started veering starply to star
hoard instead of port. The big white vessel de
scribed an arc across our bow and slithered by our
bowsprit with but yards to spare.
In exasperation, Skipper yelled up to the bridge now
towering above us, "Where the hell do you think
you're going." No answer.
If Steve had gotten the flare gun out in tune,
Skipper swears he would've fired it at the wheel
house instead of across the vessel's bow.)
But now that it was all over, everyone not on watch
hurried below to add this latest piece of adventure
to his personal records of the voyage, leaving Skipper
sputtering on deck.

ONWARD TO BUENAVENTURA, COLOMBIA—
All sails were set and drawing admirably as wo raced
along out of the channel propelled by the last furious
.spurt of the Caribbean Trades, doomed to die in the
Pacific.
