PARIS, Wednesday, Feb. 7 â€” A
Russian note delivered to the West
ern Allied powers Monday calls for
an early Big Four foreign ministers'
conference but bitterly denounces
the Allies for rearming Western
Germany, it was disclosed today.
The text of the Soviet note, handed
to the diplomatic envoys of the Unit
ed Stales, France, and Great Britain,
was made public early today by the
French Foreign Ministry.
The Russian note emphasizes that
the demilitarization of Germany is
the biggest problem in the world
crisis. It agrees that some other
questions may be discussed as side
issues. But it rules out flatly any
discussion of Far Eastern problems,
including Korea, unless Communist
China is represented.
