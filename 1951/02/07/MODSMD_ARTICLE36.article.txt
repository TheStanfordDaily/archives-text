# Jazz Dance Loses $900
## 
### 
Despite a crowd of 1,150 at the
Louis Armstrong dance Saturday
| night at the Pavilion, Cardinals an
nounced that they have lost approxi
! mately $800-$9OO on the dance. This
' is $300 more than they expected to
lose.
Cardinalsyexpected to sell 700 bids,
but sold only 540. They had planned
to subsidize from $500 to $050 on the
dance out of their fund for all-cam
pus activities.
Though all bills are not in yet, Ted
Hinshaw, Cardinals president, said
they would have to subsidize from
$800 to $900. This means that Car
dinals will probably have to cancel
any other planned student functions
for the quarter.
