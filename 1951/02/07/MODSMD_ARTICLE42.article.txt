# Doodles' Antics Grow With Each Retelling
## 
### JOY HAAS 
"Stanford didn't lose a game when I werjt to school there, so
Marchie thinks I might be a good omen for the team."
That's what Doodles Weaver said at the half of a football game
last guarter. His school loyalty is still unmistakable. The freck
led, elongated Doodles looked Hollywood-ish with his long, au-

| burn hair combed straight back and j
his glasses horn-rimmed. But he
| wore a white sweater with a big red
| "S" and sat in the third row of the
j Farm rooting section'.
Winstead Sheffield Weaver gradu
! ated from Stanford back in 1937 with
a Bachelor of Philosophy degree and
I a long list of pranks to his credit. '
i His raucous college' career has be
come an unofficial Stanford tradition.
During his sporadic college life he
j was a great cheerleader with one foot
! in hot water most of the time. In a 1
"Music Depreciation Week" in San '
Francisco, one critic wrote that i
Weaver was so funny it was hard to :
believe that he ever went to Stan
ford.
There's the time he put on a blond
wig and appropriate unmentionables j
i and hung out of a window of the old
Beta House at high noon yelling,
' Help—help, I'm being attacked."
Even back in Doodles' days, Stan
ford speedsters had trouble with
Menlo cops, or vice versa. Weaver '
led them on a merry chase one night |
when they tried to stop him for
speeding. Ho got them on a square
- and finally ended up chasing the po
lice. <j>
Weaver used to get himself out on
! a limb—literally. Some unsuspecting

friend would come into his room for
I a friendly chat until Doodles would
| pretend to be insulted by an inno
! cent remark. He would shout, "All
I right, if that's the way you feel about
it, I'm going to end it all."
With a dramatic fling of the arms,
ihe would run to the window and
throw himself out, apparently to be
dashed to the ground below. But in
stead he would always grab'a certain
| limb.
I Then one of his buddies sawed the
i limb off, and the next time he ran*
[ through his routine and threw him
; self out of the window—splat!
Even at home he was enterprising.
| One time his parents took an ex
tended trip abroad. While they were
j gone young Weaver painted their
house black and white, and turned
it into a popular and profitable
speak-easy.
i But there's a moral to these stories.
Doodles Weaver, with all his extra
curricular activities, managed to
I graduate plus 54.

"Stanford didn't lose a game when I werjt to school there, so
Marchie thinks I might be a good omen for the team."
That's what Doodles Weaver said at the half of a football game
last guarter. His school loyalty is still unmistakable. The freck
led, elongated Doodles looked Hollywood-ish with his long, au-

| burn hair combed straight back and j
his glasses horn-rimmed. But he

Winstead Sheffield Weaver gradu

a Bachelor of Philosophy degree and
I a long list of pranks to his credit. '
i His raucous college' career has be
come an unofficial Stanford tradition.
During his sporadic college life he
j was a great cheerleader with one foot
! in hot water most of the time. In a 1
"Music Depreciation Week" in San '
Francisco, one critic wrote that i
Weaver was so funny it was hard to :
believe that he ever went to Stan
ford.
There's the time he put on a blond
wig and appropriate unmentionables j
i and hung out of a window of the old
Beta House at high noon yelling,
' Help—help, I'm being attacked."
Even back in Doodles' days, Stan
ford speedsters had trouble with
Menlo cops, or vice versa. Weaver '
led them on a merry chase one night |
when they tried to stop him for
speeding. Ho got them on a square
- and finally ended up chasing the po
lice. <j>
Weaver used to get himself out on
! a limb—literally. Some unsuspecting

friend would come into his room for
I a friendly chat until Doodles would
| pretend to be insulted by an inno
! cent remark. He would shout, "All
I right, if that's the way you feel about
it, I'm going to end it all."
With a dramatic fling of the arms,
ihe would run to the window and
throw himself out, apparently to be
dashed to the ground below. But in
stead he would always grab'a certain
| limb.

i limb off, and the next time he ran*
