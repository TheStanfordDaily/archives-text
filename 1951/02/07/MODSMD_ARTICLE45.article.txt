(Jmck I uylor, the New Headman
You just can't help liking Chuck Taylor.
We button-holed the new headman at 5 p.m. Monday, just as he was mov
ing into his new green office in the BAC with the name MARCHMONT
SCHWARTZ on the door. We allowed as to how he must be a busy man
and that we make our interview short and sweet. But he broke out in a
broad, infectious grin, and said, "That's all right, you take as much time
as you want to, Pete. I've got plenty of time."
He immediately noticed a marked contrast between Taylor and his
predecessor. Marchie is well-mannered, debonair, dapper, a television
cameraman's delight, and always a hit reserved. Taylor, on the other
hand, looks like a big kid who iust got off the farm—very approachable
and very easy to meet. Probably the thing that impressed us most was
the deep sincerity he showed in wanting to do a good job at Stanford.
Taylor's record leaves little doubt about his coaching ability. He men
toi'ed three undefeated Stanford freshman teams to championships, before
accepting a berth as line co«\ch with tlit; pro '49ers. Red-headed Chuck
did an excellent job with the San Franciscans, although the '49ers didn't
have a winning year. As the Chronicle's Will Connolly said, Taylor had the
horses, but not the elephants. And in pro ball you need elephants. A 230-
pound tackle is considered a midget, an undersized fish that should be
thrown back in the river.

There'll He Some Changes Made
Taylor, a mere adolescent in the head coaching profession at 31, said, "I
have profited by my experience in professional football, because in pro ball 1
you experiment a lot and you find out what will and what will not work.
In college you don't have much opportunity to do that."
Chuck received the full blessing of his former owner, Tony Morabito
of the '49ers. Morabito told Chuck that be could count on him for any
help he wanted. That, however, presumably didn't include the farming
out of Albert, Standlee, and Nomellini to the Indians.
Concerning his immediate plans, Taylor said, "I plan to get my office in
order and look into the prospect of establishing the players in the ROTC
program. Starting next week, I am going to have a personal talk with each
one of the team members. The next month will be devoted to all the non
technical aspects of football. I plan to confer with the alumni, do public
relations work, get acquainted with the newspapers, and generally find out
all the aspects connected with my coaching position here.
"Spring practice is tentatively set for the middle of April, and it will last I
for :!0 days. I will make some changes in our offense, but nothing earth- ■
shaking—just a difference in the approach."
No One Will Leave Chuck Alone
Taylor's home life of late has been hectic—to pose an understatement.
The Taylor home in Menlo Park, where Chuck lives with his wife Margaret
and his two small children, has been thrown in an uproar by a flood of tele
phone calls and a troop of well-wishers and photogs streaming in and out. :
A 1 Masters has considered placing a special patrol around the Menlo Park
residence, lest the newly-hired coach make some rash attempt at suicide. 1
No one will leave the poor guy alone.
Regarding his appointment, Chuck said, "I naturally feel very happy,
and with the efforts of the staff which we are gathering together. I feel
that Stanford is going to be a very enjoyable place to coach. I think that
the ballplayers will also enjoy their association with the staff."
We are sure of one thing, and that is that the ballplayers will enjoy then
association with Chuck, because as we said, you just can't help liking the
fjuy. Yes, and he knows how to coach.
