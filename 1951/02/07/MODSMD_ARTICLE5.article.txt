# Draft Controversy
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”Key members of
the House Armed Services Commit
tee accused the Defense Department
today of "wasting" manpower and
served notice on military leaders
that they have failed to prove the
need for an 18-year-old draft.
Simultaneously, the committee
ordered the department to report on
how many men in the National
Guard and reserves are eligible for
the draft now. It indicated it wanted
them drafted and replaced in the
Guard and reserves by veterans who
served less than 27 months.
