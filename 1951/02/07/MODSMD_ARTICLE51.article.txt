# Cake Walk Artist Struts Again
## White Dances 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
William White not only ad
mits being in vaudeville lor 30
years, but he claims he helped
kill it.
Students will have an oppor
tunity to judge the validity of
this claim Friday night when
Mr. White puts on an old-time
song-and-dance routine for the
Red Crocs Student-Faculty Tal
ent Show. The show starts at
7:30 p.m. in Cubberley Audito
rium. Tickets are $1.
White got into show business the
easy way, by simply being born into
it. That was 44 years ago when his
parents owned one of the largest
Negro road shows in the country.
One of his first big acts was a cake
walk which he did at the age of
seven.
When the movies came in, he de
cided to break away from show busi
ness but on the first break he could
get no farther- away from the stage
than the orchestra pit.
For three years he led the orches
tra in Chicago's Regal Theater.
From the pit he jumped back on
the stage, but this time in therole of
theatrical producer. This also lasted
three years.
At the age of 30, White finally
made the break from show business.
Among other things he became a
mechanic, and prior to coming to
Stanford a year ago, he was head
mechanic for Safeway. Since he has
been here, White has worked in the
stacks in the main library.
His Friday night routine will con
sist of bits from the repertoires of
vaudeville greats, including Bert
Williams, Eddie Leonard, Pat Roo
ney, and Eddie Cantor.
White, who does the booking in
the family, has booked his wife, Mrs.
Gertrude White, in the show. Mrs.
White, who objected at first, is now
wondering, "How did I get into
this?"
Mrs. White also works in the main
library where she is clerical assistant
in the circulation division. She has
been here for three years.
No stranger to show business, Mrs.
White for many years led an orches
tra which toured the country.
She is accomplished in the piano,
French horn, clarinet, trumpet, gui
tar, and other instruments which Mr.
White couldn't remember off-hand.
She is at home with either jazz or
classical music.
The Whites were engaged in a
friendly family quarrel late yester
day afternoon over Mr. White book
ing her for the show. He says she
will play the trumpet, but she feebly
shakes her head, meaning she won't
even be in the show.
Friday night should hold the an
swer.


VAUDEVILLE TROUPER — Bill White was a vaudeville per
former in "the good old days." White will dance and sing in the
Friday night Talent Show. "In the old days," says White, "if
you toid them you could sing, they asked if you could stand on
your ear."


COMBINES BOOKS WITH MUSIC — Gertrude White, cler
ical assistant in the Main Library, toots the horn she may blow
in Friday night's Red Cross Student-Faculty Talent Show. It's
still problematical whether or not she'll toot. Husband Bill White
says she will. She says no.
