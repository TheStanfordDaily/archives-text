## Rail Operations Slowly Resuming 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (UP) â€”
White House intervention in the
railroad strike has apparently been
forestalled by a steady back-to
work movement, particularly in
Chicago and St. Louis, authoritative
sources here said tonight.
They said railroad operations have
returned to 50-95 per cent of normal
in some parts of the country.
Meanwhile, San Francisco post of
fice authorities authorized resump
tion of mail service today between
Pacific Coast cities as railroad
switchmen showed some signs of
ending their "sickness' strike.
Commute service on the Southern
Pacific Railroad to Peninsula points
remained suspended, however, until
Brotherhood officials give their as
surance that switching crews will be
on hand to handle the trains, a com
pany spokesman said.
In San Francisco and other North
ern California points the back-to
work movement gained momentum
and the job of unraveling the long
strain of backed-up freight cars and
their cargoes was begun.
