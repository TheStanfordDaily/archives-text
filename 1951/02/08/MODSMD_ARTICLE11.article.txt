# Excom Okays Rome Observer
## $100 Expenses Tentatively Granted; Proposal for SAB Election Tabled 
### 
Excom voted unanimously last night to send an observer to the
Rome World Peace Conference, but reserved the right to choose
the delegate and to decide how much expense money to grant.
ASSU Prsident Ted Buttner said that a tentative limit of $100
would be given the observer for living expenses during the eight-

day conference. The observer will
be chosen from a list of possible dele
gates to be presented to Excom by
the Rome Congress Committee.
Excom also decided to look into
the possibility of electing student
representatives to the Stanford
Athletic Board. The present mem
bers, Tom Shaw and Jesse Cone,
were appointed by Buttner, who
also is an SAB member.
Excom voted to send an observer
to Rome when Tom Bartlett, mem
ber of the Rome Congress Commit

tee, asked that his group be given
further instructions.
Bartlett said several Stanford peo
ple were under consideration, but
that the limited expense money to
be granted by Excom would limit the
choice to someone who could pay his
own transportation expenses to and
from the conference.
Excom also voted, 8 to 4, to appro
priate $285 to send two representa
tives to the AWS convention at Pur
due University during spring vaca
tion. Harry Rowe, Gil Jonas, Ed
Fleischer and Carol Penney voted
against the motion because they felt
that one delegate would provide suf
ficient representation.
Jonas, in explaining (hat he
thought AWS should definitely
have some representation at the
conference, brought up the ques
tion of what criteria should lie set
tip when questions of representa
tion to conferences come before
Excom.
Jonas was a leader in the unsuc
cessful movement to send an official
Stanford delegate, with full expenses
paid, to the Rome Peace Conference.
Excom appeared split into two
camps on the question of the student
body electing student members of the
SAB.
"112 think the members should be
elected because it will make students
more conscious of the fact that one
third of the SAB is comprised of stu
dents. An election would add en
thusiasm and understanding to the
SAB's role here," he said.
Bill Bcthke pointed out the dan
ger of overlooking the best possible
.student members in an election,
because many men would be run
ning for other offices.
Ex-officio members do not have
voting rights, Ted Buttner ruled last
night in re.sponse to a question raised
by former Daily editor Gordon Ad
dison at last week's meeting. He said
that Excom is not an incorporated
body, thus can not give ex-officio
members a vote. Business manager
Dave Elliot and Daily editor Row
land Rebele are present ex-officio
members.
Gordy Campbell was instructed by
Excom to go forward with plans for
a mimeographed pamphlet on cam
pus traffic regulations.
Excom voted unanimously to send
a 'welcome" letter to new football
coach Chuck Taylor and a "thank
you" letter to former coach Marchie
Schwartz.

Ex-officio members do not have
voting rights, Ted Buttner ruled last
night in re.sponse to a question raised
by former Daily editor Gordon Ad
dison at last week's meeting. He said
that Excom is not an incorporated
body, thus can not give ex-officio
members a vote. Business manager
Dave Elliot and Daily editor Row
land Rebele are present ex-officio
members.
Gordy Campbell was instructed by
Excom to go forward with plans for
a mimeographed pamphlet on cam
pus traffic regulations.
Excom voted unanimously to send
a 'welcome" letter to new football
coach Chuck Taylor and a "thank
you" letter to former coach Marchie
Schwartz.
Excom voted unanimously last night to send an observer to the
Rome World Peace Conference, but reserved the right to choose
the delegate and to decide how much expense money to grant.
ASSU Prsident Ted Buttner said that a tentative limit of $100
would be given the observer for living expenses during the eight-

day conference. The observer will
be chosen from a list of possible dele
gates to be presented to Excom by
the Rome Congress Committee.
Excom also decided to look into
the possibility of electing student
representatives to the Stanford
Athletic Board. The present mem
bers, Tom Shaw and Jesse Cone,
were appointed by Buttner, who
also is an SAB member.
Excom voted to send an observer
to Rome when Tom Bartlett, mem
ber of the Rome Congress Commit

tee, asked that his group be given
further instructions.
Bartlett said several Stanford peo
ple were under consideration, but
that the limited expense money to
be granted by Excom would limit the
choice to someone who could pay his
own transportation expenses to and
from the conference.
Excom also voted, 8 to 4, to appro
priate $285 to send two representa
tives to the AWS convention at Pur
due University during spring vaca
tion. Harry Rowe, Gil Jonas, Ed
Fleischer and Carol Penney voted
against the motion because they felt
that one delegate would provide suf
ficient representation.
Jonas, in explaining (hat he
thought AWS should definitely
have some representation at the
conference, brought up the ques
tion of what criteria should lie set
tip when questions of representa
tion to conferences come before
Excom.
Jonas was a leader in the unsuc
cessful movement to send an official
Stanford delegate, with full expenses
paid, to the Rome Peace Conference.
Excom appeared split into two
camps on the question of the student
body electing student members of the
SAB.
"112 think the members should be
elected because it will make students
more conscious of the fact that one
third of the SAB is comprised of stu
dents. An election would add en
thusiasm and understanding to the
SAB's role here," he said.
Bill Bcthke pointed out the dan
ger of overlooking the best possible
.student members in an election,
because many men would be run
