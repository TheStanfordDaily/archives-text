# Student Goal Set at $4,000 By Red Cross
## 
### 
Stanford students will be asked to
contribute $4,000 toward the na
tional goal of $85,000,000 in the Red
Cross drive to be conducted on cam
pus next week.
The Korean war has made the
success of this drive vital. The Red
Cross now has five major programs
under way to meet the increased de
mands of the armed forces and civil
ian defense needs.

There will be a meeting of Red
Cross solicitors today at 4:30 p.m.
in the Women's Clubhouse, Kay
Wold, chairman of the drive, said.
Kits and posters will be handed
out to the representatives.

The Red Cross is giving top prior
ity to procuring blood.
The Red Cross, as part of its role
in civil defense, has been given a
goal of first aid training for at least
one person in every family.
Civil defense plans assign the Red
Cross the responsibility of providing
food, clothing, and shelter for vic
tims of attack. One of the biggest
jobs of the Red Cross is its overseas
program. It must meet the needs of
the SVa-million-raan fighting force
and aid American prisoners of war.
