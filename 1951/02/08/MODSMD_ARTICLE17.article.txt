# Brandin Explains Civilian Defense
## Fire House Blasts to Warn Campus of March 'Dry Run' 
### 
Stanford Business Manager Alf Brandin, commander-in-chief of
campus civilian defense, explained "overall campus civilian de
fense organization" to leaders and assistants of Stanford's seven
divisions last night.
Individual indoctrination of those of the estimated 200 persons

who attended, who have not yet been
indoctrinated, will take place within
the next 10 days, Brandin said.
Stanford has been designated as
zone 22, an unincorporated unit un
der county supervision, Brandin an
nounced.
Warning Signals
Two alert conditions have been es
tablished by Santa Clara County,
yellow and red. Yellow condition,
signaled by a steady one-minute
blast of the firehouse whistle, will set
into motion the "dry run" of indi
vidual divisions within the next 10
days.
Red condition is to be signaled by
an intermittent blast of the whistle
lasting as long as air is available in
the firehouse air tanks—two to three
minutes. The condition will be used
when there is no time to alert per
sonnel for an attack.
A co-ordinated dry run of Stan
ford s seven civil defense divisions
will be held between Mar. 1 and 15.
CD Hierarchy
Explaining campus organization
below the division level, Brandin said
the campus has been organized into
26 areas, with a civilian police head
and assistants assigned to each.
The police will handle problems of
fire, car movements, mass hysteria,
and will be aided by students in an
unofficial capacity.
Brandin explained that students
will not be called upon in official ca
pacities, because of the training
problems presented by the rapid
turnover of students.
Loyalty Oath
Commenting on the loyalty oath
each civilian defense worker will be
asked to sign, Brandin explained that
without the signed oath on file with
the county, workers injured in per
formance of* duty would have no
compensatory rights.
In a question and answer period
following his talk, Brandin said Stan
ford's "target value" is probably low,
hut that the open acreage and espe
cially the golf course have high de
fense value as evacuation areas.
