# For Better Public Relations...
## 
### 
For the past few weeks, the germ of an idea—
one that could conceivably work wonders in
ihe field of public relations at Stanford—has
been batted around, mostly in student govern
ment circles.
The idea calls for the creation of a student
body public relations department. If set up,
ihe department would send speakers to Cali
fornia's high schools, sponsor such programs
as "High School Day," and —most important—
publicize the work of the student body, both
to the outside world and to the students.
Frankly, we think the idea is a gem. From
our standpoint —that of the college newspaper
dealing daily with the publicity problems of
various student organizations—we would wel
come the inclusion of a department which
would function as a central reservoir of knowl
edge, technique, and contacts in the student
jijblic relations field.
We foresee a great demand among the
.seemingly hundreds of campus publicity chair
men for the help and advice that such an or
ganization could offer to bolster publicity cam
paigns and "get the word" to the students,
both through The Daily and otherwise.
However, lucrative as the department
sounds, we feel its success would depend
largely on the student appointed its first "di
rector." To begin with, such a man would have
io know The Daily,, know Stanford, and know
student organizations. Secondly, he would
have to exhibit a genuine interest in the job of
publicizing Stanford to the student body and
the general public. Moreover, he would have
to have some experience in public relations
work.

Finally — and most important — a student
would have to be selected who knows how to
be tactful as well as helpful. When working
with student groups whose members neces
sarily change from year to year, the ideal pub
lic relations man should have something con
crete and effective to offer in order to gain the
confidence of those working with him. If
he knows what the newspapers want, knows
what kind of publicity campaigns are most ef
fective, and has a feeling for what information
is of interest to the students, then he should not
fail.
The only way to real student appreciation of
the work behind our charity drives, lIR proj
ects, foreign student programs, and campus
cfances is through an interesting, active, and
true-to-life account of these things, and what
goes into them. A good public relations man
with a hand-picked group of assistants might
well be able to put many logy activities "over
the top" while generating deserving recogni
tion and student body interest in them at the
same time.
As far as public relations of student activities
with the general public are concerned, the pos
sibilities are unlimited. Working with the Uni
versity Director of Information, Fred Glover,
the alumni clubs, and the high schools, out
siders could learn not only the Stanford story,
bu the Stanford siudent story as well.
In short, the whole idea sounds like a good
one. We'd like to see it go beyond the "germ"
stage. But let's be sure of just what we're going
to do before we do it.
