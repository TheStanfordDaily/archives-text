# MY PRIVATE LIFE
## 
### PVT. BILL DAILEY 
IJ' I am still able to count correctly, (am I. Lieuten
ant? 1 am? Thank you, Sir!), this is installment No.
Four of "My Private Life." I thought I was being
unusual the other night when the PX served as my
"office," but today's location is even a bit more fan
tastic. My body, which answers to U.S. 56053691 these

days, is parked on a concrete
bench in the target line of the M-l
Rifle Range. I'm supposed to be
running targets up and down for
the boys on the firing line but at
the moment the fog from glorious
Monterey Bay is so thick that the
targets are out of sight and so we
waif, and Dailey gets a chance to
write a column, on his Uncle's
time and his own knee.

This rifle practice is right up my alley, but there's
really no need for me to have to brag about my marks
manship ability. Rather let me quote my First Ser
jeant, who just yesterday came over to my firing
spot, smiled fondly at my wind-burned face, patted
me tenderly on the fuzz I once called "hair' - and
chirped:
"Listen, you fatherless soandso—either you start
hitting that target or I'll have you on KP so long
your heard will be dragging in soup."
"Am I to understand, Sergeant," I rejoined, "that
you .would like me to hit a few bullseyes?"
"Never mind" the bull's eye," he erupted. "I know
>oii couldn's hit a bull in the you know what with
a bass fiddle (this man was often given to injecting

colorful imagery in his speech). All I want you to
do is hit the TARGET!"
I decided to reason with him.
"Sergeant, old chap, let's you and I face facts. I
will never be able to hit these targets. I, sir, am a
writer, a raconteur, and if nothing better comes along,
I may spend my Army Career tooting my clarinet in
the Army Band."
"Listen, Artie Shaw," he roared, "if you don't start
hitting that target, you'll spend your Army Career
surrounded by 32 bars and they won't have no notes
on them!"
"Furthermore, Sergeant," I persisted glibly, "I
have been working asiduously for 13 hours already.
We Musicians are paid double-time for all work
over eight hours."
"Oh, you want a little double-time, eh, Dailey?"
(I was flattered that he remembered my name.)
"That's right, Sergeant." It was obvious that I had
won my point.
"All right, wise guy, start double-timing it around
the area here, and when you get tired of that, report to
the cook in the mess hall and get busy on them pota
toes he's got there!"
And so, as the sun settles on the horizon (Special
Regulation 63-203-58; Subject: Sunsets), we leave our
hero gazing into the eyes of a potato, and if we listen
well, we can hear him murmur:
"Ah, darling, your eyes are gorgeous. It's a shame
to have to cut them out! But . . . you've got to realize,
Ida (ho . . .ha?) that I'm a fighting man now, a veri
table savage ... a desperate killer ... so take that,
and that. . .

IJ' I am still able to count correctly, (am I. Lieuten
ant? 1 am? Thank you, Sir!), this is installment No.

you .would like me to hit a few bullseyes?"
"Never mind" the bull's eye," he erupted. "I know
>oii couldn's hit a bull in the you know what with
a bass fiddle (this man was often given to injecting

colorful imagery in his speech). All I want you to
do is hit the TARGET!"
I decided to reason with him.
"Sergeant, old chap, let's you and I face facts. I
will never be able to hit these targets. I, sir, am a
writer, a raconteur, and if nothing better comes along,
I may spend my Army Career tooting my clarinet in
the Army Band."
"Listen, Artie Shaw," he roared, "if you don't start
hitting that target, you'll spend your Army Career
surrounded by 32 bars and they won't have no notes
on them!"
"Furthermore, Sergeant," I persisted glibly, "I
have been working asiduously for 13 hours already.
We Musicians are paid double-time for all work
over eight hours."
"Oh, you want a little double-time, eh, Dailey?"
(I was flattered that he remembered my name.)
"That's right, Sergeant." It was obvious that I had
won my point.
"All right, wise guy, start double-timing it around
the area here, and when you get tired of that, report to
the cook in the mess hall and get busy on them pota
toes he's got there!"
And so, as the sun settles on the horizon (Special
Regulation 63-203-58; Subject: Sunsets), we leave our
hero gazing into the eyes of a potato, and if we listen
well, we can hear him murmur:
"Ah, darling, your eyes are gorgeous. It's a shame
to have to cut them out! But . . . you've got to realize,
Ida (ho . . .ha?) that I'm a fighting man now, a veri
table savage ... a desperate killer ... so take that,
and that. . .

IJ' I am still able to count correctly, (am I. Lieuten
ant? 1 am? Thank you, Sir!), this is installment No.
Four of "My Private Life." I thought I was being
unusual the other night when the PX served as my
"office," but today's location is even a bit more fan
tastic. My body, which answers to U.S. 56053691 these

days, is parked on a concrete
bench in the target line of the M-l
Rifle Range. I'm supposed to be
running targets up and down for
the boys on the firing line but at
the moment the fog from glorious
Monterey Bay is so thick that the
targets are out of sight and so we
waif, and Dailey gets a chance to
write a column, on his Uncle's
time and his own knee.

This rifle practice is right up my alley, but there's
really no need for me to have to brag about my marks
manship ability. Rather let me quote my First Ser
jeant, who just yesterday came over to my firing
spot, smiled fondly at my wind-burned face, patted
me tenderly on the fuzz I once called "hair' - and
chirped:
"Listen, you fatherless soandso—either you start
hitting that target or I'll have you on KP so long
your heard will be dragging in soup."
"Am I to understand, Sergeant," I rejoined, "that
you .would like me to hit a few bullseyes?"
"Never mind" the bull's eye," he erupted. "I know
