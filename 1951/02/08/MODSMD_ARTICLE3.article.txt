# Engineer at Fault

### 
WOODBRIDGE, N.J., Feb. 7â€”A
veteran engineer, who was at the
throttle of the crack "brokers' spe
cial" for the first time, admitted to
day he was racing 50 miles an hour,
twice the speed limit, when the
packed commuter train plunged off
a trestle here, killing 83 persons.
State and county officials investi
gating the country's worst train
wreck in 33 years said tonight that
speed was the "indicated and appar
ent factor" in last night's tragedy
which injured 500.
