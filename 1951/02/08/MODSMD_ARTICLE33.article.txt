# LATEST SWEDISH EXPORT
## Orphans' Hardships Leave Critics Cold 
### HEMMING AND BUCKLEY 
The Theater, which usually
can be relied on for the most distinc
tive film fare around, has on hand
this week a Swedish film, "The Chil
dren," which certainly is distinctive,
but little more.
It is a tediously slow-moving pro
cession of hardships, kindnesses,

hardships, heart
breaks, and more
hardships that
face a group of
orphan s who
wander about
the Swedish
backwoods until

each finds a new home.
The winter backgrounds photo
graph very beautifully, but the
drama is about as cold as the snow is.

Fur some unknown reason, the
Guild's marquee calls this a "Swe
dish fantasy." The only fantasy we
could see was the unvarnished good
behavior of all the children despite
their tribulations.
At points it was so unbelievable
that we jut wished one of the kids
would pick up a rock or something
and Hino it at someone just to liven
up the proceedings a little.
