Our first official chore as sports editor of Volume 111) is a pleasant one,
indeed—that of climbing aboard the Chuck Taylor bandwagon and counting
ourselves among the many well-wishers of the popular, red-thatched grid
mentor.
It had been apparent to us for some time, as we believe to (he rest of
the student body, that Taylor was the only choice available to the Board
of Athletic Control that would have met with the whole-hearted ap
proval of the student body and of the alumni.
So our congratulations are extended both to Taylor and to the board,
along with the sincere hope that world conditions will allow the development
of a new golden era of Stanford athletic history.

The men of Everett Dean will trek to the Southland this weekend for what ,
could easily turn out to be the most important series of the Indian season, j
They'll meet the USC Trojans, currently pacing Stanford by one game in ,
the Southern Division standings, in a Pan-Pacific doubleheader that could
conceivably reverse the positions of the two squads ere the final whistle j
blows.
Not that the prospect appears too likely at this writing. The Trojans, j
overflowing with manpower and heavily favored to cop the Division title.!
ate especially mean customers to subdue in their own garrison. The In- I
dlans, as a matter of record, haven't licked the Figueroa men in Los An
geles since 1947
But in the words of the headman himself, "Anything could happen
this week. If the hoys continue the pace they set against Bradley in the
first half l.ist Saturday, we wouldn't be beaten again this year." Stan- • l
ford led Bradley at half-time. .'»7 to l'(i, lost in the final 15 seconds, (il
to 58.
Dean's contentions were seconded, incidentally, by no other than USC
Coach Forrest Twogood during a half-time radio interview from the Cow
Palace Saturday night.
Said Twogood: "Stanford's fast break tonight is the best I've seen all
season."

And the Troy mentor might well
have viewed some of the country's
outstanding teams and still not be ac
cused of enlarging upon the facts. No ;
team on the Bradley schedule, which
includes the nation's best, has led the 1
Peoria Braves by such margins as j
Stanford held during that glorious i
ten minutes. Even Fordv Anderson, a
former pupil of Coach Dean, must
have found such scoreboard counts
as 22 to 6 and 37 to 24 somewhat hard
to believe.
Dean states ruefully that, had the j
Cards continued the same type of
drive in the second half, "we would
have won without any doubt what
ever."
According to the genial mentor,
Bradley adjusted to the Indian fast
break in the final frame and the fail
ure of his men to drive on their slow j

offense .spelled their ultimate defeat. He describes Stanford's first half 1
exploits as a "super-effort,' difficult to maintain for a long period.
Another happy phase of the Cow Palace outing was the showing of
Paul Johnson, erstwhile jayvee who will go a long way toward solving
Dean's ever-present reserve problem. Johnson played a steady brand of
hall throughout his appearance and brought the record throng to its
ft'et near the close of the first half with a left-handed driving lay-in that
was one of the prettier sights of the evening.
Look, too. for considerable future action from Fritz Fenster. who has been
bothered by a bad knee most of the season but is now rapidly rounding
into top form. Fenster isn't flashy or fast, but is steady, smart, and a con- i
sistent shot. He should be considerable aid in the stretch drive.

have won without any doubt what
ever."
According to the genial mentor,
Bradley adjusted to the Indian fast
break in the final frame and the fail
ure of his men to drive on their slow j

offense .spelled their ultimate defeat. He describes Stanford's first half 1
exploits as a "super-effort,' difficult to maintain for a long period.
Another happy phase of the Cow Palace outing was the showing of
Paul Johnson, erstwhile jayvee who will go a long way toward solving
Dean's ever-present reserve problem. Johnson played a steady brand of
hall throughout his appearance and brought the record throng to its
ft'et near the close of the first half with a left-handed driving lay-in that
was one of the prettier sights of the evening.
Look, too. for considerable future action from Fritz Fenster. who has been
bothered by a bad knee most of the season but is now rapidly rounding
into top form. Fenster isn't flashy or fast, but is steady, smart, and a con- i
sistent shot. He should be considerable aid in the stretch drive.

Our first official chore as sports editor of Volume 111) is a pleasant one,
indeed—that of climbing aboard the Chuck Taylor bandwagon and counting
ourselves among the many well-wishers of the popular, red-thatched grid
mentor.
It had been apparent to us for some time, as we believe to (he rest of
the student body, that Taylor was the only choice available to the Board
of Athletic Control that would have met with the whole-hearted ap
proval of the student body and of the alumni.
So our congratulations are extended both to Taylor and to the board,
along with the sincere hope that world conditions will allow the development
of a new golden era of Stanford athletic history.

The men of Everett Dean will trek to the Southland this weekend for what ,
could easily turn out to be the most important series of the Indian season, j
They'll meet the USC Trojans, currently pacing Stanford by one game in ,
the Southern Division standings, in a Pan-Pacific doubleheader that could
conceivably reverse the positions of the two squads ere the final whistle j
blows.
Not that the prospect appears too likely at this writing. The Trojans, j
overflowing with manpower and heavily favored to cop the Division title.!
ate especially mean customers to subdue in their own garrison. The In- I
dlans, as a matter of record, haven't licked the Figueroa men in Los An
geles since 1947
But in the words of the headman himself, "Anything could happen
this week. If the hoys continue the pace they set against Bradley in the
first half l.ist Saturday, we wouldn't be beaten again this year." Stan- • l
ford led Bradley at half-time. .'»7 to l'(i, lost in the final 15 seconds, (il
to 58.
Dean's contentions were seconded, incidentally, by no other than USC
Coach Forrest Twogood during a half-time radio interview from the Cow
Palace Saturday night.
Said Twogood: "Stanford's fast break tonight is the best I've seen all
season."

And the Troy mentor might well
have viewed some of the country's
outstanding teams and still not be ac
cused of enlarging upon the facts. No ;
team on the Bradley schedule, which
includes the nation's best, has led the 1
Peoria Braves by such margins as j
Stanford held during that glorious i
ten minutes. Even Fordv Anderson, a
former pupil of Coach Dean, must
have found such scoreboard counts
as 22 to 6 and 37 to 24 somewhat hard
to believe.
Dean states ruefully that, had the j
Cards continued the same type of
drive in the second half, "we would
have won without any doubt what
ever."
