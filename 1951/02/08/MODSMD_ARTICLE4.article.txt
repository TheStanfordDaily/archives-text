# Labor Retains Power

LONDON — The Labor govern
mcnt defeated opposition attacks on
its steel nationalization program to
night by the unexpectedly comfor
table margin of 10 votes.
A Conservative motion of censure
intended to halt the scheduled gov
ernment seizure of the steel indus
try was defeated in the House of
Commons by a vote of 308 to 298.
It was the first—and most critical
—of two Conservative efforts this
week to overthrow the government
and force a general election.
