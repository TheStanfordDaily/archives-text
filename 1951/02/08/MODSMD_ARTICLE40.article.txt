# PAN-PACIFIC DOUBLEHEADER
## Cagers Work Overtime In Preparation for Troy 
### 
Coach Everett Dean put his hot
and-cold running Indians through
the paces last night, keeping mural
basketballers waiting as the Cards
poured up and down the court at
top speed searching for weaknesses
in the Trojan defenses and offenses
set up by the second team.
The Indians will play USC Fri
day and Saturday nights in the
Pan - Pacific Auditorium in Los
Angeles, renewing PCC play after
four weeks of practice and non
conference games.
Most of the afternoon and evening
was spent in perfecting a three-two
offense that the Indians used briefly
in the Bradley game last Saturday
night. The set-up consists of having
two guards and a forward working
the ball around the center of the
court, while the center and the other
forward weave through the key.
Jim Ramstead. the Cards' ball
hawking center, works with for
ward Eddie Tucker in the key,
while Jim Walsh, Jack O'Sullivau.
and Bruce Iversen work from the
guard position.
Gary Andrews, "'sixth man" for
the Cards, showed aggressive and
alert play from every spot he played
in the heavy drill last night, and he
played 'em all. Dean reacted to the
showing of Paul Johnson, a deadly
shot from almost any spot on the
ct>urt, by saying. "He has developed
very well, and will see a lot of action
this weekend."
The Indian cage mentor also men
tioned Bill Stevenson, a 6-foot fl
inch center up from last year's frosh,
as a likely prospect for action
against the Southlanders.
Coach Dean named the traveling
squad that will see Los Angeles via
the airlines. Those named are: Jack
O'Sullivan, Ed Tucker, Jim Ram
stead, Jim Walsh, Bruce Iversen,
Gary Andrews, Paul Johnson, Sid
Ilasler, Fritz Fenster, Bill Steven
son, Dan Evans, and Tom DuFour.
