# Club Building Grows, So Does Noise
## First Stage Nearing End 
### 
Late-sleeping students living
in the northern end of Toyon
Hall have been jolted rather
1 abruptly from their slumbers
during the past few mornings.
By the end of spring quarter
they will probably look like rac
coons from the size of the circles
around their eyes.
It's all because of the latest addi
j tion to the Farm. Every morning the
quiet peacefulness of the area is
J shattered when a bulldozer, a trac
tor, and a scraper, not to mention a
half dozen trucks, prepare the ground
north of Toyon for Stanford's new
j eating club building.
After this? Cement mixers. After
them? Hammers.
Meanwhile, work continues on
the building. Six trucks are haul
ing 500 tons of gravel a day from
the old quarry on Page Mill Road.
The rest of the equipment is level
ing off the gravel to make a solid ,
J base for the structure.
Bob Brown, supervising operations
1 for Vance Brown, Palo Alto con-
I tractor, estimates the job of filling j
| and leveling will be completed by
' the end of next week if good weather i
I prevails.
According to Brown, a 10-ton
j roller will probably start working
[ today. Two thousand tons of gravel
; have been hauled to the site with an
other estimated 2,500 needed to com
plete this phase of the work.
The next phase will include the
laying of a nine-inch reinforced
concrete floating slab foundation
and the installation of plumbing
; outlets.
The completed building will be in |
the shape of an "L" with the arms j
I on the north and east sides of the lot. I
The building will be ready for occu- j
! pancy fall quarter of this year.


AS IT WILL BE—This is
a blueprint version of
how the Eating Clubs'
Home will look when it
opens its doors and its
ovens in the fall. The
building adjoins Toyon,
and is being built on
what was a parking lot.


AS IT IS NOW — Half a dozen trucks have been busy the past several days unloading 2,000
tons of gravel as a base for the long-awaited Eating Club Building. Only 2,500 tons more and
the first phase will be over. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson
