• A certain minority in the U. S. seems
to believe big companies should lie
broken up ... even though big com
panies have led the way in helping
provide an unmatched standard of liv
ing and helped keep the nation strong.
The U. S. was very thankful for its big
companies during the last two world

wars... and is again in today's critical
times. This is a big country with big
problems, and it needs both big and
small companies to meet them. You
can be certain we will do everything
we can to continue doing a good, effi
cient, productive job for you and the
nation .;. a good bip job.

John E. Clark, insurance man from San Francisco, California; writes; j
"From all I can gather, the West's oil companies have contributed a lot to our area.

Now there's talk about breaking them up. What I'd like to
know is who wants to upset the West's oil industry now?"

STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA
• plans ahead to serve you better



Do small business men?
Standard of California is a big
customer for small businesses
in the West. Last year, for ex
ample, we spent, more than
$90,000,000 with some 10,000
business firms.


Do customers? Not likely.
Oil companies have turned
out constantly better prod
ucts and services at reason
able prices. Except for taxes, a
gallon of gasoline today costs
about what it did in 1919.



Do stockholders? Surely
not. There has never been a
year when Standard has failed
to pay a dividend. 98,f500 in
dividuals share the earnings
of Standard, depend on the
stability of Standard to as
sure safety for their savings.


Do employees? The average
income of 28,000 Standard
people was $4,447 last yejir.
And Standard Oilers are cov
ered by sickness, free insur
ance, retirement and other
employee benefits.

Do tax collectors? Standard
turns in the taxes you pay
when you buy gasoline and
oil, and we are also taxed, of
course, as a company, lie
cause we ore big, our taxes are
sizeable—last year, for exam
ple, over $9f»,000,000.


Do military men? Planes,
ships, tanks are powered with
oil. Military men naturally
look to the big companies to
supply their big needs. As in
World War 11, Standard's fa
cilities are producing petro
leum products at full speed.
