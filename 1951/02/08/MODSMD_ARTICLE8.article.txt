# TALENT SHOW
## Professors To Star In Juggling Act 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
"Anyone can be a juggler,
but who wants to?"
That's what Richard W. Gable
said yesterday about his num
ber one hobby.
To prove how easy it is, he will
demonstrate his juggling ability at
the Student-Faculty Red Cross Tal
ent Show Friday night. The show
starts at 7:30 p.m. in Cubkerley Au
ditorium. Tickets are $1.
Gable, assistant professor in the
political science department, picked
up juggling (he calls it a "lost art")
in his high school days. That was
about 14 years ago.
Since then he has performed for
club meetings, banquets, dinners, and
other occasions for which his talents
were sought.
Ph.D. at Chicago
Gable came to Stanford last Octo
ber from the University of Chicago
where he was working for his Ph.D.
He took his undergraduate work at
Bradley and was a teacher at Ohio
State for two years.
One of his most interesting stage
experiences happened at the Univer
sity of Chicago in 1939 when the jug
gler was performing at a club meet
ing. He thought his act was going
along swell, but he had misgivings
when he finished, for the president
of the university approached him
with ominous determination.
The president led Gable into the
hall, complimented him on the act,
and took hold of the juggling equip
ment. It turned out that the presi
dent was also a juggler and he merely
wanted to show Gable how he did it.
Patter (iocs With It
The act, Gable says, is more than
juggling. A line of patter goes with
it. To help with the patter, he signed
a partner, Robert A. Walker, to play
the piano for the act.
Walker is an associate professor in
political science. He learned to play
the piano when he was "so high," he
said, waving his hand a couple of feet
from the floor.
He has been playing the piano off
and on for most of his life, but mostly
off, he said.
"I play strictly for pleasure," M;\
Walker pointed out, and added that
the talent show would be his first
stage appearance.
He completed his undergraduate
and graduate work at the University
of Chicago and came to Stanford in
June of 1049.

and on for most of his life, but mostly
off, he said.
"I play strictly for pleasure," M;\
Walker pointed out, and added that
the talent show would be his first
stage appearance.
He completed his undergraduate
and graduate work at the University
of Chicago and came to Stanford in
June of 1049.
"Anyone can be a juggler,
but who wants to?"
That's what Richard W. Gable
said yesterday about his num
ber one hobby.
To prove how easy it is, he will
demonstrate his juggling ability at
the Student-Faculty Red Cross Tal
ent Show Friday night. The show
starts at 7:30 p.m. in Cubkerley Au
ditorium. Tickets are $1.
Gable, assistant professor in the
political science department, picked
up juggling (he calls it a "lost art")
in his high school days. That was
about 14 years ago.
Since then he has performed for
club meetings, banquets, dinners, and
other occasions for which his talents
were sought.
Ph.D. at Chicago
Gable came to Stanford last Octo
ber from the University of Chicago
where he was working for his Ph.D.
He took his undergraduate work at
Bradley and was a teacher at Ohio
State for two years.
One of his most interesting stage
experiences happened at the Univer
sity of Chicago in 1939 when the jug
gler was performing at a club meet
ing. He thought his act was going
along swell, but he had misgivings
when he finished, for the president
of the university approached him
with ominous determination.
The president led Gable into the
hall, complimented him on the act,
and took hold of the juggling equip
ment. It turned out that the presi
dent was also a juggler and he merely
wanted to show Gable how he did it.
Patter (iocs With It
The act, Gable says, is more than
juggling. A line of patter goes with
it. To help with the patter, he signed
a partner, Robert A. Walker, to play
the piano for the act.
Walker is an associate professor in
political science. He learned to play
the piano when he was "so high," he
said, waving his hand a couple of feet
from the floor.
He has been playing the piano off
and on for most of his life, but mostly
off, he said.

Walker pointed out, and added that
