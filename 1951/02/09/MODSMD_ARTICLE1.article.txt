## Railmen Respond To Army Demand 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 8 (UP)â€”Railroad
switchmen trooped back to their
jobs at many remaining strike points
tonight in response to an ultimatur
from the Army to end the costly
walkout or be fired.
The Army said thousands trooped
back at Chicago, the nation's rail
hub, and some roads made plans to
restore full passenger service.
Other workers came back at
Cleveland, Knoxville, Tenn., San
Francisco, San Jose, Pittsburgh, and
Huntington, Ore.
The strikers had mixed reactions
to the Army order, issued at the be
hest of President Truman, who de
plored the strike and said union
leaders had acted like a bunch of
Russians.
(Normal service was resumed on
the Peninsula late yesterday after
noon, according to Roxy Clapcs,
chief clerk in the Palo Alto SP office.
Ho said that ticket sales weren't ex
pected to pick up until today.)
