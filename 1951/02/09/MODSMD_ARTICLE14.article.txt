## 
### 
"Democracy is not a polite em
ployer. The only way out of elective
office is to get sick or die or get
kicked out," Herbert Hoover, former
President of the United States, be
gins his memoirs.
The first installment of his me
moirs appears in the Feb. 17 issue of
Collier's Magazine, on the news
stands today. Included in this issue
of the magazine are Hoover's Stan
ford experiences.
Hoover arranged the first Big
Game. He says that he printed 10,-
')00 tickets and, when 20,000 people
;wamped the field, he had to grab a
wash boiler and dishpan from across
the street to hold the silver and gold
coins. The only detail of the game
Hoover overlooked was the football;
the first Big Game was delayed half
an hour while someone rushed
;lowntown to buy one.
The articles will be continued in
later issues of the magazine.
Tomorrow Mr. Hoover will speak
on foreign affairs in New York. His
talk will be broadcast over KFRC
from 7 to 7:30 p.m., PST.
