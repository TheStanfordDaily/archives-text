# Each Student Asked for $1
## 
### 
Soliciting will begin Monday
on campus for the Red Cross
drive. Stanford's goal is $4,000.
Students will be asked to give at
least $1, but Kay Wold, chair
man of the drive, said, "We
hope students will double that
amount to help the Red Cross
mobilize for defense."
The success of this drive is vital
because of the Korean war, and the
increased need for the services which
the Red Cross performs.
The organization now has five ma
jor programs under way to meet the
demands of the Armed Forces and
the Civil Defense program.
First is procuring blood to sup
• ply the huge need of the lighting
forces. They are now collecting
9ft,000 pints a month but have to
multiply that amount by many
times to build up a stockpile of
plasma.
Although donors give their blood,
and volunteer nurses aides, canteen
workers, and Gray Ladies give their
time, the blood collection activities
involve heavy expenses for equip
ment and professional nurses arid
doctors.
As part of its role in Civil Defense,
the Red Cross has been given a goal
of first aid training for at least one
person in every family. Evening and
day classes are being scheduled, as
well as special instruction in treat
ment of injuries from atomic bomb
attack.
The Red Cross must also train
250.000 nurses aides and thousands
of housewives in home nursing to
meet the critical shortage of pro
fessional nurses. This training pro
gram is being intensified because
professional medical help may not
be available during an emergency.
Tlie national Civil Defense plan as
signs to the Red Cross the responsi
bility of providing care, food, cloth
ing, and shelter for victims of attack.
Athletic Director A 1 Masters is chair
man of the disaster committee for
the local chapter and is working
closely with Civil Defense officials.
One of the most important jobs of
the Red Cross is its overseas program.
It must meet the needs of 3'/ 2 million
fighting men and aid American pris
oners of war.
The Red Cross receives its funds
solely through voluntary contribu
tions and receives no financial aid
from the government. Its accounts
are audited by both the Depart
ment of the Army and by Haskin
& Sells, certified public account
ants. The complete audit is also
forwarded to Congress.
A small paid staff provides con
tinuity, training, and professional
skills not otherwise available. The
present ratio is more than 100 volun
teers to every paid worker, but this
will be even higher after millions of
additional volunteers arc mobilized
to meet defense needs.

As part of its role in Civil Defense,
the Red Cross has been given a goal
of first aid training for at least one
person in every family. Evening and
day classes are being scheduled, as
well as special instruction in treat
ment of injuries from atomic bomb
attack.
The Red Cross must also train
250.000 nurses aides and thousands
of housewives in home nursing to
meet the critical shortage of pro
fessional nurses. This training pro
gram is being intensified because
professional medical help may not
be available during an emergency.

A small paid staff provides con

additional volunteers arc mobilized
to meet defense needs.
Soliciting will begin Monday
on campus for the Red Cross
drive. Stanford's goal is $4,000.
Students will be asked to give at
least $1, but Kay Wold, chair
man of the drive, said, "We
hope students will double that
amount to help the Red Cross
mobilize for defense."
The success of this drive is vital
because of the Korean war, and the
increased need for the services which
the Red Cross performs.

jor programs under way to meet the
demands of the Armed Forces and
the Civil Defense program.
