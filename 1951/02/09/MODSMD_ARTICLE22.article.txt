# Not Too Much to Ask

The Student-Faculty Talent Show tonight
will kick off Stanford's annual Red Cross drive.
Beginning Monday and all next week, repre
sentatives will begin house-to-house solicita
tions as Cardinals seek to collect the Farm's
$4,000 quota.
This year, because of the world situation,
the government has asked the Red Cross to
assume new duties besides its innumerable
regular tasks. The organization is giving top
priority to procuring blood for the fighting
fronts and for Civil Defense requirements.
Even with its many volunteer workers, the Red
Cross must meet the high expenses of financ
ing such mobile blood banks as visited the
campus last week.
In addition, the Red Cross has the responsi
bility of instructing some 20,000,000 persons in
first aid as part of ifs role in Civil Defense; it
must train 250,000 nurses aides and hundreds
ol thousands of housewives in home nursing
to meet the critical shortage of professional
nurses a national emergency would produce; it
must expand its disaster relief program in pre
paration for any attack; it must
serve, in many ways, the needs of the fighting
forces.
All this takes money, and that money must
come from contributions, the Red Cross' only
financial source.

Stanford students have consistently fallen j
short of their own drive quotas in the past few
years; in fact, last fall's combined welfare cam
paign marked the Farm's sixth consecutive
failure to reach its quota in a charity drive.
Possibly with that in mind, the Red Cross has
left this year's drive total at the same level as
that of the past two years, although the Palo
Alto area goal was raised by $8,000.
Past failures have often been attributed to
the drive's poor organization, a lack of pub
licity, faulty timing, or half-hearted solicitation.
Maybe these criticisms were partly justified.
But the Red Cross drive is the only all-campus
drive this quarter. Cardinals have moved the
time ahead to mid-quarter instead of conduct
ing it simultaneously with the National cam
paign in March. This was done to avoid solicit
ing funds at the end of the quarter when stu
dents' pocketbooks are notoriously empty.
The sponsors have made every effort to select
enthusiastic and efficient solicitors.
This time there should be no excuses. If we
fail to meet our quota now, at a time when
contributions are most desperately needed and
when we cannot help but realize the import
ance of giving all we can, the blame will lie
where it belongs —on our own indifference to
a needy call. —8.8.
