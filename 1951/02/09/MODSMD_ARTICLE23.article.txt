# CAMPUS OPINION
## Critics Leave Her Cold 
### 
To the Editor:
Too bud the Daily's "critics," as a pair named Hem
,ming and Buckley were so quaintly dubbed in Thurs
day's paper, were not treated by the Guild Theatre
this past week to some rollicking, roaring French
scandal. Instead they had to sit—their legs undoubt
edly dangling over the seats ahead of them—through
a movie called "The Children," one which throughout
•had the beautiful simplicity of its title, and for a
couple of hours put you in a refreshing world of
'honesty and goodness. '
• One big stupid sneer was all they could utter. May
be they were too wearied by it all to utter more—or
maybe they were too dull-witted to see what the pic
ture offered. Most likely they didn't have the courage
to commend a movie about children and kindness and
living on the grounds that it was more in the
realm of appreciation of some Paly grammar school.
Seems it's a sign of weakness to give credit to any
thing like that once you're in college.
Granted, everyone's more than a little sickened by

gushing sentiment, but there is nothing that is art
less in "The Children." This is Viot simply my own
drummed-up opinion; there are critics—real critics
all over the country on my side.
And who do Hemming and Buckley have on their
side?— Bless them: each other.
