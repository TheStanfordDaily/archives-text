# Where's the Dippy?

To the Editor:
Three days a week at our eight o'clock class there
are no papers on the Engineering Corner. The other
two days they are all gone by nine. What I want to
know is—are there any seven o'clock classes?

P.S. I want a paper!
(Reader PorterJield's problem seems to l>e a fairly
common one. As a result. The Daily, beginning to
day, will channel more of its issues to such "sore
spots" as the Engineering Corner. A crusade to "lock
up the Quad" until S a.m., however, is definitely out
of the question.—The Editor.)
