# One-Act Settings Almost Finished
## 
### 
Amid music cues, lighting wires, and almost-completed sets, re
hearsals for the One-Acts are proceeding smoothly. While actors
and actresses are practicing their speeches, the stage crew is
working on various parts of the three sets to be used.
Technical director for the show, to be presented next Thursday,

Friday, and Saturday nights, is
George Anderson. Larry Yust has
designed all sets. Lighting and spe
cial effects are under direction of Ed
LaPiere. Property head is Milt Cohen
and costume designer is Sally An
derson.
The setting for "One Hundred
Acres and a Man" will reproduce a
temporary camp site in small ra
vine in the prairie country ol' the
Cherokee Strip, near the Kansas
border. Beside the* campfire will be
a covered wagon, temporary home of
the Franck family while they await
the opening of the Cherokee terri
tory.
The wagon was built by the stage
crew from a flat wagon formerly
used by the Corporation Yard for
seeding. Redwood slats were bent to
form the framework, which will be
covered with asbestos curtain.
Many props will be used to aid the
authenticity of the play. Cohen,
prop man, had to get an authentic
Kentucky hunting rifle and a six

, shooter. Costumes will be those of
rural Southerners of the ISilO's, with
the exception of the uniform of a
cavalry sergeant of the U.S. Army.
From a rural scene, "Angel of the
Lord" will take the audience to a
swanky New York apartment. For
this play it was necessary to secure
i an Empire-piece sofa of the early
| lyOO's. Alter much searching, it was
found at Polly and Jake's Antique
I Shop on El Camino Real.
j LaPiere, in charge of lighting, will
I use many special effects on this play
to heighten the emotional and intel
i lectual elements in it. Costumes will
; be modern.
"Any Number Will Do" is using
1 three flats hinged together to a tri
> angular base for its setting. The set
: will rotate, and each side of the tri
! angle will be used foiÂ«v a differenet
J background. Most of the action will
I take place in the heroine's apart
i ment, as she dials "any number" in
! order to find a date.
