# Stanford Boxers to Meet California
## 
### JIM MADISON 
The Stanford boxing squad tan
gles with an invading California ag- !
gregation at 8 p.m. tomorrow in the
Pavilion in the first of two matches ,
between the two teams. General I
admission is 80 cents, with student
body card holders admitted free.
If the past week's practice means
anything, the Cards appear to have
a good chance of copping their lirsl
win of the year against the Bears.
In the training gym Bob Bal
docchi, one of the Indians' two
winners against L r CLA, and Jim
Kerr, who fought ail exhibition
bout last Saturday, have been '
looking especially improved.
Baldocchi hooks up with Hank I
Harvey, a two - year letterman, in ]
what should be the hardest-fought
bout of the evening at 165 pounds.
Both these men enjoy the heavy go
ing and should throw a lot of leather.
Kerr is looking so much improved I
that Coach Emery Mitchell has made
arrangements with the Bears to fight
two bouts at 145 pounds, both ol |
them to count points. Kerr will fight |
one for Stanford and veteran Bob
i Baker the other.
The Indians' other victor in tho
UCLA match. Bob Myers, has been
working this week to sharpen his
punching to combine with the cool
boxing he displayed last Saturday.
Ilis opponent tomorrow night will
he George Peleonis.
Two other men from whom much
| improvement is expected are Bob
| White and Tom Griffiths. White,
1 fighting at 135 pounds, is probably
the cleverest and fastest boxer on
: the team, and in shape he will give
| a good account of himself against the
: Bears.
i Griffiths, 130 - pounder for the
Cards, finally seems to have shaken
off the heavy cold he has been
; plagued with all this season and
I will be ready to go at top speed to
: morrow night.
The question mark appears to be
| John Colton in the 155-pound divi
: sion. Colton was counted on to be
; the mainstay of the team this year,
but so far he has been unimpressive
in drawing one bout and losing a
; second. However, his sparring has
; been vicious this week and tomor
row night may be his time to ex
plode.

; plagued with all this season and
I will be ready to go at top speed to
: morrow night.
The question mark appears to be
| John Colton in the 155-pound divi
: sion. Colton was counted on to be
; the mainstay of the team this year,
but so far he has been unimpressive
in drawing one bout and losing a
; second. However, his sparring has
; been vicious this week and tomor
row night may be his time to ex
plode.

The Stanford boxing squad tan
gles with an invading California ag- !
gregation at 8 p.m. tomorrow in the
Pavilion in the first of two matches ,
between the two teams. General I
admission is 80 cents, with student
body card holders admitted free.
If the past week's practice means
anything, the Cards appear to have
a good chance of copping their lirsl
win of the year against the Bears.
In the training gym Bob Bal
docchi, one of the Indians' two
winners against L r CLA, and Jim
Kerr, who fought ail exhibition
bout last Saturday, have been '
looking especially improved.
Baldocchi hooks up with Hank I
Harvey, a two - year letterman, in ]
what should be the hardest-fought
bout of the evening at 165 pounds.
Both these men enjoy the heavy go
ing and should throw a lot of leather.
Kerr is looking so much improved I
that Coach Emery Mitchell has made
arrangements with the Bears to fight
two bouts at 145 pounds, both ol |
them to count points. Kerr will fight |
one for Stanford and veteran Bob
i Baker the other.
The Indians' other victor in tho
UCLA match. Bob Myers, has been
working this week to sharpen his
punching to combine with the cool
boxing he displayed last Saturday.
Ilis opponent tomorrow night will
he George Peleonis.
Two other men from whom much
| improvement is expected are Bob
| White and Tom Griffiths. White,
1 fighting at 135 pounds, is probably
the cleverest and fastest boxer on
: the team, and in shape he will give
| a good account of himself against the
: Bears.
i Griffiths, 130 - pounder for the
Cards, finally seems to have shaken
off the heavy cold he has been
; plagued with all this season and
I will be ready to go at top speed to
: morrow night.
