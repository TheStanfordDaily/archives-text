# U.S., British Newspapers Compared

"America has many more news
papers than England, but an Eng
lishman has more newspapers to
choose from, in a given locality, than
an American."
This contradictory-sounding state
ment was made by Mr. Patrick
Monkhouse, assistant editor of the
Manchester Guardian, when he
spoke to an attentive audience of
nearly 60 persons Wednesday night
in the Student Union dining room.
The larger English newspapers are
circulated throughout most of Great
Britain, he said, whereas American
newspapers have limited circula
tions.
A morning newspaper printed in
London can be delivered throughout
the country before breakfast time.
Because of this rapid transportation,
Mr. Monkhouse pointed out, an Eng
lishman has 10 or 12 newspapers to
choose from whereas an American
seldom has half that many.
Of course this makes for stronger
competition in England, he contin
ued, for English papers compete with
cach other on a nationwide basis.
Mr. Monkhouse also contrasted
American and British newspapers.
English newspapers arc restricted to
10 or 12 pages becausc of a news
print shortage, he said. Consequent
ly, space is much more precious than
on American papers.
He said advertising lineage occu
pied about 33 per cent of a British
newspaper, compared to about 66 per
cent here.
Mr. Monkhouse's appearance was
sponsored by Theta Sigma Phi,
women's journalism fraternity, and
Sigma Delta Chi, men's journalism
fraternity.
He was itnroduccd by Sigma Delta
Chi president Joe Cusick.
