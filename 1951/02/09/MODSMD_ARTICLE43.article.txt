## 
### 
With the prospect that many
seniors will be in the service
after graduation, the Vocational
Guidance and Placement Serv
ice urges that seniors register
with them even though not seek
ing a job, so that their records
will be on file.
This process will enable Stanford
men to make a quicker return into
the economic picture when their pe
riod of enlistment is over, according
to Eugene Dils, director of the Place
ment Service.
Interview Required
Registration procedure requires
the student to have an interview with
a member of the Placement Service
staff. Training, work experience, ex
tra-curricular activities, interests,
and desired employment are listed.
Next the student gets letters of rec
ommendation from people on the fac
ulty and from past employers.
Since a number of placements arc
made each year by mail, students are
asked to submit seven photographs.
All the information is compiled at
the office and made into portfolios
which are sent to employers upon re
quest. t

branches of the service and subject
to call within a few months, em
ployers are willing to take them into
