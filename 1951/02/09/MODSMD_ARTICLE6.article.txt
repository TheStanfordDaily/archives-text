# Cards Battle SC For League Lead
## 
### EARL ODELL 
Twelve Indian cagers will take to the airways at 9:30 this morn
ing, as they plane to Los Angeles to oppose the league-leading
USC Trojans in Pan Pacific Auditorium tonight and tomorrow
night. Post time for both games is 8:30.
The Trojans, with a three ancl one league record, will try for

their third six-game winning streak
of the season by going for a double
victory over the Cards, tied with
UCLA for second place in the South
ern Division race. By out-defensing
Santa Clara and USF last weekend
at the Cow Palace in San Francisco,
SC ran its current win streak to four
straight.
A good defensive team, an od
dity in these days of high-scoring
games, the Figueroans arc led by
guard Boh Kolf, who is being
pushed for All-American. An ag
gressive ball - hawker under the
boards, Bob also possesses an ac
curate eye and has a nine-point
average going into the weekend
games.
The Trojans' pair of rangy centers,
Jerry Pease and Bob Boyd, are other
sharpshooters on the squad. Pease
in particular is a hard man to stop.
In league competition he has stuffed
in 13 field goals in 28 shots.
Guard Tom Riach is another man
who figures prominently in the SC
defense that has held the opposition
to leSp than 50 points a game—the
best record in the West.
Forwards Bruce Bennett and

Bob Morton have taken over the
major role in Troy's defense. By
ron Van Alstync and Bud I)oty
provide the flr^t- stringers with a
breather now and then and arc
themselves capable of carrying of
fensive chores.
Stanford's brilliant offense, a defi
nite challenge to the Trojan defense,
is geared to the sensational scoring
of forward Ed Tucker. Eddie, a
threat on any team, has been held
down during the past couple of
weeks, but he, along with center Jim
Ramstcad, will have plenty of scor
ing opportunities this weekend as
they take on the offensive duties of
a new Indian offense.
Playing from either side of the
key, Tucker and Ramstead will be
fed the ball from Jim Walsh, Bruce
Iversen, and Jack O'Sullivan at
guard positions. However, with a
stiff Trojan defense, long shots may
be the order of the day, and in that
case Jim Walsh, Cards' long - shot
artist, will find himself in constant |
demand.
At u disadvantage in regard to
height, the one point in Stanford's .
favor is speed. The Indians are
acknowledged to be the fastest
quint on the Coast, but El Troi is
nit slouch, contrary to the opinion
of many who saw SC play Santa
Clara and USF in the Cow Palace
last weekend.
Commenting on the slowness of
the Trojan offense in those games,
Coach Everett Dean of the Indians
j said, "It must he remembered that
the Southern Cal boys just finished
examinations. The fact that Santa
Clara isn't a top team, although they
are better than their record indi
cates, and the fact that UCLA beat
USF 75 to 42 earlier, led the Trojans
to take it easy. Actually they are no
I .slow team."
The matter of Card reserves, a
hindrance since the beginning of the
season, may be solved somewhat by
the excellent showing of Paul John
son, who was a constant high point
{ man for the JV's and who has shown
I great promise in the varsity games
1 in which he has appeared.
Johnson, along with Clary An
drews and possibly Bill Stevenson,
another comer, will add a great
deal to the Indian strength.

However, the Southlanders out - i
point the Cards in the reserve de
partment. They are at least two men I
deep in nearly every position. The
reserve problem could very well j
spell the difference of the final t
scores; but, if the Indians can keep -
up the blistering pace which they j
showed in the first half of the Brad- 1
ley game last Saturday night, there
may be a new league leader come
Sunday morning.
Tentative lineups for the two
games are:
STANFORD USC
O'Sullivan 112 Bennett
Tucker 112 Morton
Kamstead c Pease
Walsh g Kolf
Iversen ff Riach

themselves capable of carrying of
fensive chores.
Stanford's brilliant offense, a defi
nite challenge to the Trojan defense,
is geared to the sensational scoring
of forward Ed Tucker. Eddie, a
threat on any team, has been held
down during the past couple of
weeks, but he, along with center Jim
Ramstcad, will have plenty of scor
ing opportunities this weekend as
they take on the offensive duties of
a new Indian offense.
Playing from either side of the
key, Tucker and Ramstead will be
fed the ball from Jim Walsh, Bruce
Iversen, and Jack O'Sullivan at
guard positions. However, with a
stiff Trojan defense, long shots may
be the order of the day, and in that
case Jim Walsh, Cards' long - shot
artist, will find himself in constant |
demand.
At u disadvantage in regard to
height, the one point in Stanford's .
favor is speed. The Indians are
acknowledged to be the fastest
quint on the Coast, but El Troi is
nit slouch, contrary to the opinion
of many who saw SC play Santa
Clara and USF in the Cow Palace
last weekend.
Commenting on the slowness of
the Trojan offense in those games,
Coach Everett Dean of the Indians
j said, "It must he remembered that
the Southern Cal boys just finished
examinations. The fact that Santa
Clara isn't a top team, although they
are better than their record indi
cates, and the fact that UCLA beat
USF 75 to 42 earlier, led the Trojans
to take it easy. Actually they are no
I .slow team."
The matter of Card reserves, a
hindrance since the beginning of the
season, may be solved somewhat by
the excellent showing of Paul John
son, who was a constant high point
{ man for the JV's and who has shown
I great promise in the varsity games
1 in which he has appeared.
Johnson, along with Clary An
drews and possibly Bill Stevenson,
another comer, will add a great
deal to the Indian strength.

However, the Southlanders out - i
point the Cards in the reserve de
partment. They are at least two men I
deep in nearly every position. The
reserve problem could very well j
spell the difference of the final t
scores; but, if the Indians can keep -
up the blistering pace which they j
showed in the first half of the Brad- 1
ley game last Saturday night, there
may be a new league leader come
Sunday morning.

season, may be solved somewhat by
the excellent showing of Paul John
son, who was a constant high point
{ man for the JV's and who has shown
I great promise in the varsity games
1 in which he has appeared.
Johnson, along with Clary An
drews and possibly Bill Stevenson,
another comer, will add a great
deal to the Indian strength.

However, the Southlanders out - i
point the Cards in the reserve de
partment. They are at least two men I
deep in nearly every position. The
reserve problem could very well j
spell the difference of the final t
scores; but, if the Indians can keep -
up the blistering pace which they j
showed in the first half of the Brad- 1
ley game last Saturday night, there
may be a new league leader come
Sunday morning.
Tentative lineups for the two
games are:
STANFORD USC
O'Sullivan 112 Bennett
Tucker 112 Morton
Kamstead c Pease
Walsh g Kolf
Iversen ff Riach
