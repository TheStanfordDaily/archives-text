# KZSU Elects Herb Seiter New Manager
## 
### 
Herb Seiter rode unopposed into
the top office of KZSU station man
ager in yesterday's stalT elections at
the campus Jradio station. Dick
Lentz. Dick Gross, and Bob Lee were
also winners in the balloting that
will bring into office on Monday the
second-term KZSU staff.
With the new quartet of managers
comes a reorganization of KZSU
which will generally consolidate the
present organization.
Seiter, who has worked on KZSU
for six quarters, began as a writer
and worked his way up through pro
ducer on the Cardinal Classics show,
the office of continuity director, and
is now vacating the position he has
held as program manager. He en
tered Stanford in 1947, was gradu
ated three years later with an A.B.
in biology, and is now working for
an M.A. in speech and drama.
Lee, who steps into Seiter's shoes
as the new program director, began
working on KZSU five quarters ago
as a staff announcer. He was subse
quently a board engineer and pro
duction manager, the position which
he now leaves to replace Seiter. Lee
is majoring in economics and lives at
the Village.
Outgoing station manager Lentz
was elected to business manager
over Dale Caldwell in a very close
race. Lentz, who has worked at
KZSU for five quarters, is a journal
ism major, a member of Sigma Delta
Chi honorary journalism fraternity,
and is an Alpha Sig.
In another close race, Gross won
over incumbent candidate for engi
neering manager Steve Stevens.
Gross is now finishing his term as
recording chief, a position to which
he was appointed after having begun
at the station as a board engineer
five quarters ago.
"We hope to promote a new trend
in policy," said station manager elect
Seiter. "Instead of trying to be a
miniature replica of a big network
station, we hope to make KZSU a
real college station, featuring shows
that have to do with Stanford or
that can only be done at Stanford."
The new staff for the coming term
will be announced at an impromptu
party to be held this afternoon at
Mama Garcia's. The entire campus
is invited to attend.
