# South Koreans Drive Across 38th Parallel

TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 12
(UP}—The South Korean capital
division swept dramatically
across the 38th parallel into
North Korea Sunday.
Aided by strong air and naval sup
port., the South Koreans drove up t.hn
cast coast and captured Yangyang,
five miles north of the old border.
The South Koreans made their

crossing as other United Nations
forces on the west coast drove to the
gates of Seoul and sent patrols into
the battered city. The parallel drives
gave the Allies two steel fingers
thrusting up the Korean coastlines.
However, a serious Communist
counter-offensive was developing in
the central sector above Inchon and
Hocngsong, where heavy fighting be
gan during the night and still was
raging today.
United Press correspondent Joe
Quinn reported from the central
front that Chinese forces—presum
ably some of the 40,000-odd remnants
of a 100.000-man Red army defeated
below Seoul—were believed to be
joining North Korean Communists in
that sector. (See picture on page 2.)
