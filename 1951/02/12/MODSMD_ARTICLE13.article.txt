Stanford students have al
ways been able to join the
Red Cross. They belong to a
country civilized enough to
adhere to humanitarian prin
ciples. They gave the right

training of 250,000 nurses' aides, civil
defense planning, and the develop
ment of Red Cross services to meet
the needs of an increased armed
force.
During the past summer, 35 Red
Cross regional blood centers were in
operation as part of the national
blood program for civilians and with
the war, these immediately went
into action to supply military needs.
They are now collecting more than
90,000 pints of blood a month, ac
cording to the Red Cross.

for taking care of food, clothing, and
shelter for victims of any attack.
This is an extension of the basic

overseas and stateside bases, pro

to others, into the hands of trained, efficient, devoted, unquestioning folk who are in the places
where help is needed.
This year, the chance to join the Red Cross must be a comfort to you. It is already very per
sonal to you, very close. Some of you will needâ€”and receive the services that Red Cross is es
tablished to bring you. You will find it in boot camp, in your training field, perhaps at your
battle station. More important, it might be your visitor in a hospital. It might bring you the
blood you need to stay alive. You may be helping yourself, when you give now to the Red
Cross.
There is something even better. In emergencies you can't reach out and give a hand to your
friends, to the people you love, to those beside you now. But you can stockpile that help in the

Red Cross, sure that no dis
tance, no obstacles will pre
vent its reaching them at the
time they need it, wherever
they are.
The rest of us are touched
to see you taking care of
yourselves and each other
this .week. We are glad you
can. It will make you feel
better and it is your right.
