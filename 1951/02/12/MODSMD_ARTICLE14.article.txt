# Prep Visitors To Tour Farm
## 
### 
Stanford students will be hosts
Saturday to more than 300 students
from 39 high schools in the San
Francisco, East Bay, and Peninsula
areas.
Purpose of the visit is to acquaint
prospective students with the aca
demic offedings and student life at
Stanford, said Ted Buttner, ASSU
president.
The students will be guests for
lunch at various dining halls on the
campus, announced Fletcher Taylor
and Joan Isham, student co-chair
men of "High School Day."
The program will include student
guided tours of various laboratories,
the athletic plant, Hoover Tower,
Memorial Church, and other land
marks on the campus, and presenta
tion of a one-act play.
Each school was asked to select
students who were most likely to be
able to meet Stanford's entrance re
quirements.
The idea grew from last year's
visit to the campus of 250 high school
students from the East Bay area
under the sponsorship of Stanford
alumni.
