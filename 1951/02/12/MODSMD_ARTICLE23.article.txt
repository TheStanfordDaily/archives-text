## 
### 
Voluntary tetanus and typhoid immunization will begin
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoons from 1 to 5 p.m.
and will continue every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at the
same time until the end of spring quarter. All shots are free.
Men who are going into the service should not report for im-

munization, since the Army will im
munize them again after their induc
tion.
In order to facilitate the handling
of students at the Health Service, Dr.
George Houck, head of the Stanford
Health Service, has announced a
schedule according to University
residences as to when the shots may
be taken. If students cannot go at
the appointed time, they are still
urged to come for their shots.

or the Union Units, and men living
at Encina, Stern, Crothers, or

uled. Women from Branncr and
Rolile and off-campus men are
asked to go to the Health Service
Friday afternoon.
The three tetanus shots should be
taken at intervals of three weeks, al
though as much as six weeks can oc

cur between shots. The series of ty
phoid shots will take 15 days—each
shot taken one week after the pre
ceding shot.
Stanford women are the primary
target of the campaign, since the pro
gram is probably the only way they
may be reached for immunization.
Men who are not going into the
armed services within the next eight;
months are also asked to take the
series of shots.
Booster shots, which will rcin
forcc the previous shots, will he

The shots should not affect the stu

weeks after the series.

The three tetanus shots should be
taken at intervals of three weeks, al
though as much as six weeks can oc

cur between shots. The series of ty
phoid shots will take 15 days—each
shot taken one week after the pre
ceding shot.
Stanford women are the primary
target of the campaign, since the pro
gram is probably the only way they
may be reached for immunization.
Men who are not going into the
armed services within the next eight;
months are also asked to take the
series of shots.
Booster shots, which will rcin
forcc the previous shots, will he
given to veterans and students who
traveled to Europe last year and
took the series then.
The shots should not affect the stu
dents in such a way that they will
interfere with daily routine.
Dr. Houck urged students to begin
the series as soon as possible because
active immunity from tetanus is not
reliable until live months after the
series has been completed. Active
immunity from typhoid occurs a few
weeks after the series.
