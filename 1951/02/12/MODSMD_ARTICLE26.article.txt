# One Chapter of the Stanford Story
## 
### 
In the past, student editors have written
reams and reams of copy about the "Stanford
Spirit." In the same light, student readers have
shaken their heads, snorted a little, and flipped
the Daily's pages to something more interest
ing. So of late, we've been soft pedaling the
"Stanford Spirit" routine.
Today we think we've got something to write
about. Call it a part of Stanford Spirit if you
will, but, above all, judge it on its own merits.
We think it's a good precis of what students
and faculty are doing hereabouts, and we want
to tell the story to those of you who don't al
ready know it.
Last Friday night a student group led by Zelle
Letts, John Gallagher, and Fred Bremenkamp
ataged a Student-Faculty Talent Show to kick
off the Red Cross drive which starts today.
The producers recruited top student talent
plus an impressive array of faculty and ad
ministrative performers. They worked hard
and got results.
If you saw the show, you may know what
we're getting at. If you didn't, we won't be
sticking our necks out to comment that it was
one of the finest two and one-half hours of en
ertainment we've ever spent.
Every act—from Professor Gable's juggling
routine to the singing, dancing, and trumpeting
of the Whites (which was the hit of the evening)
- was of professional stamp. Students, faculty,
and administration clapped loud and long,
brought the actors back for curtain calls, and
demanded "seconds" time and again.
If we'd had a campus visitor last Friday and
wanted to show him "how we live at Stanford,"
we'd have taken him to the talent show.
During the half-time intermission, we'd have
introduced him to the faculty players — to
Thomas Spragens of the President's office, to
Jarnes Work of the English Department, to

rangy, bespectacled John Troxell of the Biz
School, and to Fred Glover and Alf Brandin,
two of Stanford's many administrators who
were on hand to laugh a lot and applaud as
hard as the rest.
We would have sat tight—and a little too
proudly, perhaps — when the colored Whites
came out of the wings to do their part for the
Red Cross. Former vaudevillians who toured
the nation both as producers and actors, Wil
liam White sang, joked, and tap-danced his
way to a hundred hearts, while his wife Ger
trude literally amazed those who know her
only as a librarian with triple-tongue work on
the trumpet.
We wouldn't have said a word when the cast
coaxed producer Letts to the center of the stage
at the end of it all and asked her to take a bow,
which she did, "for making the show what it
was." Words couldn't have conveyed the de
sired impression.
Right now, words are inadequate. We can
only hint at the kind, of thing the talent show
indicated: co-operation between students and
faculty to such an extent that the profs can "let
their hair down" and "feel at home" with their
students.
The Talent Show was just another example
of what the students are doing and how the
faculty is lending a hand to put Stanford "over
the top." If the student body ever needed a
public relations man to tell this simple story
by example and not by mere generalizations,
Friday night was the time.
Behind it all —we are convinced—was not
only a desire to contribute time and energy to
a worthwhile cause, the Red Cross. At the bot
tom of all such activities is the "Stanford Spirit"
—call it what you will—a unique bit of some
thing found only "where the rolling foothills
rise. . .
