# ENROLLMENT DROPS, PRICES RISE
## UC Hit by World Impact 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Five-cent "coffee with cream" is now just a memory
at the University of California as an estimated 16,182
.students begin a new and "different" semester.
Enrollment has dropped 3,000, and as the remain
ing s'tudents register, they are handed a pamphlet on
how to survive an atomic attack. Motion pictures and
lectures on the atomic bomb have been scheduled for
the whole student body. Over the January vacation
buildipgs were inspected and some chosen as bomb
shelters.
The Bear's Lair, student cafeteria, luis pulled the
nail* out of its price ceiling. For the first time since
li)ts, prices have gone up. "Coffee with cream" is
7 cents. Sandwiches and grilled hot dogs have risen
five cents, but the sandwiches will now include
"pickle and potato chips," tin- "Daily Californian"
announced in the first paper of the new term.
The-paper refused to editorialize on its usual "Wel
coniv to our happy campus theme." Instead it says
tho.-University of California has the same problems
as other universities throughout the nation.
Professors have complained of the drop in quality of
academic work. Lower enrollment is a serious prob
lem which will eventually cut student funds and stu
dent activities and will increase the "aspirin con

sumption of administration employees," an editorial
says.
The concluding paragraphs in the first editorial of
a bright, new semester follow the pessimistic theme
of all the college newspapers that have crossed (lie
Daily's desks in the past week.
"The international tension which lias built up since
World War II has taken its toll of the faculty, too. In
our fevered search for safety from Communism, we
have allowed ourselves to discard some of the essential
freedoms of a democracy; and the University is one
of the outstanding examples of this. Neither the Re
gents' non-Communist contract nor the state loyalty
oath has gotten rid of any faculty members unfit to
teach; they have caused the loss of some of our most
Valuable personnel. And many of the faculty members
who have remained have acquired a justified fear of
opening their mouths.
"Altogether, this is not the best of times to be going
to school. We have only a little time left, unless the
international situation takes an almost miraculous
turn for the better, to enjoy some remnant of what a
University education should be."

articles describing reactions on other campuses to
the ever-increasing tenseness of the world situa
tion.)
