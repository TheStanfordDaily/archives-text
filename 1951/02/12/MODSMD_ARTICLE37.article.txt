DANCING IN THE DARK—This unique boxing shot shows both Bob Myers of Stanford and
George Peleonis of California with their eyes closed as they trade left jabs. This action took
place in the second round of the l'/5-pound fight at the Pavilion Saturday night. Peleonis won
the decision, as Cal won the match, 5V2 to 2Vi. —Daily photo by John Thompson
