## Trojans Bop Indians In Southland Foray 
### EARL ODELL 
Twelve little Indians dejectedly
returned to the Farm last night after
i a weekend trip to L<>.s Angeles where
| they dropped a pair of games to the
CJSC Trojans Friday and Saturday
nights, t>s to 54 and 72 to 45.
The wins for the Figueroans put
them out in front in the PCC race
by two games over the Bruins of
UCLA. Stanford, at the moment,
rests in the cellar, keeping California
company. With a two-win, four-loss
record.
Friday night the Cards started out
with a spurt that had the Southland
ers worried. Eddie Tucker, sharp*
: shooting forward, appeared to be
back on his game as he tanked 12
points in the first half. At intermis
sion the Indian rooters saw Stanford
| out in front 35 to 30.
It might have been the altitude or
the attitude, but from then on the
weekend was a complete flop. The
Trojans came back in the second half
! with a new lease on life and took
; over the backboards as if they owned
them. Guards Tom Riach and Bob
Kolf proved their worth as they held
the Indians to a mere 19 points. So
effective were they that Tucker
made only one field goal.
Center Bob Boyd of the Southern
i ers walked away with high point
| honors for the evening with 17, fol
lowed by Riach with 12. For the
Indians Tucker and center Jim Ram
stead tallied 14 points; each, and Jim
Walsh scored 13.
i Saturday night there were more
I fouls called against the two teams
than the points on the Stanford side
of the scoreboard. The referees had
a field day as they called 23 personal
! fouls against the Indians and 34 per
sonals against the Trojans. Jack
O'Sullivan and Bruce Iversen eol-
I lected five fouls apiece for a walk
j off, as did Bud Doty and Don Un
-1 derwood of the Southlanders.

Twelve little Indians dejectedly
returned to the Farm last night after
i a weekend trip to L<>.s Angeles where
| they dropped a pair of games to the
CJSC Trojans Friday and Saturday
nights, t>s to 54 and 72 to 45.
The wins for the Figueroans put
them out in front in the PCC race
by two games over the Bruins of
UCLA. Stanford, at the moment,
rests in the cellar, keeping California
company. With a two-win, four-loss
record.
Friday night the Cards started out
with a spurt that had the Southland
ers worried. Eddie Tucker, sharp*
: shooting forward, appeared to be
back on his game as he tanked 12
points in the first half. At intermis
sion the Indian rooters saw Stanford
| out in front 35 to 30.
It might have been the altitude or
the attitude, but from then on the
weekend was a complete flop. The
Trojans came back in the second half
! with a new lease on life and took
; over the backboards as if they owned
them. Guards Tom Riach and Bob
Kolf proved their worth as they held
the Indians to a mere 19 points. So
effective were they that Tucker
made only one field goal.
Center Bob Boyd of the Southern
i ers walked away with high point
| honors for the evening with 17, fol
lowed by Riach with 12. For the
Indians Tucker and center Jim Ram
stead tallied 14 points; each, and Jim
Walsh scored 13.
i Saturday night there were more
I fouls called against the two teams
than the points on the Stanford side
of the scoreboard. The referees had
a field day as they called 23 personal
! fouls against the Indians and 34 per
sonals against the Trojans. Jack
O'Sullivan and Bruce Iversen eol-
I lected five fouls apiece for a walk
j off, as did Bud Doty and Don Un
-1 derwood of the Southlanders.

Kolf proved their worth as they held
the Indians to a mere 19 points. So
effective were they that Tucker
made only one field goal.

Twelve little Indians dejectedly
returned to the Farm last night after
i a weekend trip to L<>.s Angeles where
| they dropped a pair of games to the
CJSC Trojans Friday and Saturday
nights, t>s to 54 and 72 to 45.
The wins for the Figueroans put
them out in front in the PCC race
by two games over the Bruins of
UCLA. Stanford, at the moment,
rests in the cellar, keeping California
company. With a two-win, four-loss
record.
Friday night the Cards started out
with a spurt that had the Southland
ers worried. Eddie Tucker, sharp*
: shooting forward, appeared to be
back on his game as he tanked 12
points in the first half. At intermis
sion the Indian rooters saw Stanford
| out in front 35 to 30.
It might have been the altitude or
the attitude, but from then on the
weekend was a complete flop. The
Trojans came back in the second half
! with a new lease on life and took
; over the backboards as if they owned
them. Guards Tom Riach and Bob
Kolf proved their worth as they held
the Indians to a mere 19 points. So
effective were they that Tucker
made only one field goal.
Center Bob Boyd of the Southern
i ers walked away with high point
