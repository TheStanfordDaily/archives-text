1 game victory streak was snapped by j
i the USF Dons in a hectic 61 to 58 '

The Papooses died fighting. With

j stall to protect a 59-54 lead, but Tom
I Greene and then Olie Suzdaleff stole I
. the ball and went the length of the J
I tloor for lay-ins. Suzdaleff missed j

; to make the score 59-58 with a hall
! minute to go.
| Once again the Dons went into a !

kicked the ball. USF took it in and
added an insurance bucket for the '
win.
The upset was engineered almost j
single - handedly by one Frank
j Evangelho. late lo Fremont High in
| Oakland. Evangelho dunked in 28
! points, controlled both backboards,
j and may well be the boy to le&d
, the Dons back into the national
; limelight in years to come.
. For the Cards, Dave Epperson ltd
the scorers with 17 points, while Don
! Carlson tallied 15.
The Dons got off to a quick lead,
but Epperson almost single-handed
ly brought the score to 15 all. Then
Carlson and Don DeLong tallied to
put the Papooses in the lead, but
with Mr. Evangelho hitting five
' buckets in four minutes, the Dons
i stormed back and retired at half
time with a 35-28 lead.
In the second stanza, the winners ;
hung on to.their lead and were not I
