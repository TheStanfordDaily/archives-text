# Horsehiders Down Alumni
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball squad
got oft on the right loot last Friday
as they chalked up an 8 to 2 practice
win over an alumni aggregation,
most of whom played on last year's
CIBA championship squad. Jim
Claypool, who worked the first three
innings for the varsity, was credited
with the win. The varsity grabbed
a four-run lead in the first frame on
two walks, an error, and a pair of
base knocks. The aiumni were not
able to dent the plate until the sixth
i inning, when they scored their two
; runs.
