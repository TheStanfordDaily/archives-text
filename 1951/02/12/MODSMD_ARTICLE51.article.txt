# Dr. Kreps Retains Contacts With Students, Government

### CARYL HARMS 
If you think you've got
budget - balancing problems,
then this story may cheer you.
Just multiply your budget
worries by some 150 million (for
all of us in the U.S.A.), and you
begin to get an idea of the job
facing Dr. Theodore J. Kreps,
professor in business economics
in the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
Because Dr. Kreps has another
title — Staff Director of the Joint
Committee on the Economic Report.
He has been in Washington. D.C.,
since mid - December and will re
main there until the Economic Re
port, based on the President's budg
et message to Congress, has been
prepared.
At an informal discussion with
students at his home just before lie
left, Dr. Kreps had a few remarks on
the subject of wage and price con
trols.
"The President docs not want to
use such controls," he said, "but
recent wage and price vises may
force him to ask for them in order
to preserve the economic system
itself."
Answering a question from one
veteran, he said that he was "afraid
that controls will increase the de
mand for manpower and so necessi
tate more drastic measures to fill
military quotas."
"And what is most regrettable," he
added, "is that this move must bring
further extension of government
into our society."
A tall, fit man with keen blue
eyes and thinning gray hair, Dr.
Kreps scarcely looks his 53 years.
In casual conversation he still
punctuates his speech with the
"shucks" and "pshaw" of the farm
boy—a term he likes to apply to
himself.
But on serious topics, he speaks
authoritatively and dynamically. In
an argument he will produce statis
tics and facts faster than most peo
ple can muster opinions.
The Sunday night student gct-to
gethers at the Kreps home date back
to 1933 when the professor, his wife,
and the first four of their six chil
dren moved into their large, Span
ish-style house.
"Classes were a good bit smaller
at Stanford then," Dr. Kreps re
calls. "Shucks, we used to barbe
cue steaks for the whole gang in
our back yard. Then we'd sit
around after dinner and do our
talking."
Nowadays the seminar groups
number 40 to 50 students, wives, and
guests. When preliminary introduc
tions and some scrambling around
for chairs have been completed, ev
eryone gets acquainted with inci
dental talk on weather or travel or
mutual friends.
Then someone fires the first

"heavy" question, and the real dis
cussion is on. It may channel into
any field of current interest — into
politics, war, international affairs, or
business.
Kreps is equipped by both his aca
demic background and ins actual ex
perience to be an expert in many
subjects.
His Washington experience goes
back to December, 1934, when he
was appointed chief of the Statis
tics Section of the Research and
Planning Division of the NRA.
This particular job lasted only
until June, 1935, but since then, as
he says, "there hasn't been a year
when 1 haven't been called in to
work with some government or
ganization."
Among the boards and depart
ments for which he has acted as con
sultant and adviser are the OPA, the
Department of Justice, and the
Board of Economic Warfare.
Kreps has also published several
books on business and economics,
the most recent being "Measure
ment of the Social Performance of
Business" (1941).
In spite of the other activities

which press on his time and in
terest, Kreps has insisted on main
taining a close contact with his
students.
"leaching is the most wonderful
job in the world," he says emphati
cally. 'Nothing gives me greater
satisfaction than my association with
the fine young men at the Univer
sity.
'And when they go on to success
in their careers—well, I really get a
kick out of hearing about it. It's the
best feeling I know."
