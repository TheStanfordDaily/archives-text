### 
NEW YORK â€”Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey broke sharply with top Re
publican spokesmen today and said
it would be the "utmost of folly" to
depend upon sea and air power to
protect the United States against
Communist aggression.
Dewey urged that America mobi
lize faster, that more American
troops be sent to Europe immediate
ly, and said that he felt the deploy
ment of troops was no business of
Congress.
