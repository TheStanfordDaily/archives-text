# Food Price Freeze?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President Tru
man appeared today to have aban
doned any notion of asking Congress
for authority to freeze prices of eggs,
potatoes, oranges, or any other foods
at below-parity levels.
Recent statements by top adminis
tration officials arc being taken by
Farm Belt Congressmen as fairly
conclusive evidence that Mr. Tru
man has rejected that idea. They
pointed in particular to Secretary of
Agriculture Charles F. Brannan's
newly voiced defense fo parity pro
tection for farmers.
