### DOROTHY DODGE 
The Whites earned volley after volley of applause Friday night.
The occasion was the Red Cross Student-Faculty Talent Show,
and the act was a combination of singing, dancing, and drum- and
trumpet-playing by Mr. and Mrs. Bill White, Stanford Library em
ployees.
Along with 11 other student and faculty acts, the Whites played

to an enthusiastic audience of over
400 persons. As the opening event in
the annual Red Cross Fund drive,
the program netted $329.26, show
chairmen Zelle Letts and Fred
Bremenkamp reported.
Juggler Richard Gable, assistant
professor in the Political Scicncc
Department, was amnnff the show
stoppers. Weaving humorous pat
ter into his act, he aroused- laugh
ter bv Juggling as an Englishman,
a Scotsman, a timid soul, and a
penny gum machine.
Considerable talent on the student
level was shown by, Bob James,
Gayle Plumber, Jim Hughes, and
Bill Winden, the Sophomore Quar
tet. Smooth harmonizing rated them
an encore.
Perhaps the most uninhibited of
the faculty acts was "The Graham
Cracker Suite" or "Who Let Martha
Out?" starring Miss Adele Sttogon,
Assistant Counselor of Women; Miss
Janet Boyle, director of Ventura
Hall; Miss Helen Schrader, speech

and drama professor; and Richard
Balch, chief counselor for men. The
women cavorted across the stage in
a pseudo - modern dance; shirtless,
shoeless Counselor Balch bounded
in and out; and the audience roared.
Making a reappearance as Pro
fessor Rullivant, the anthropology
professor of 'sft Gaieties fame,
Morgan Stock capably and hu
morously emcecd the show.
Bill White, an experienced per
former from vaudeville days,
brought to the stage a winning com
bination of songs, dances, and hu
mor. He and his wife took turns at
the drums while their young son
Billy looked on â€”to the audience's
delight.
Other outstanding performers
were songstress Judy Rudolph,
Mary Genshlea as the Devoted
Queen in a Roblc Sponsors' skit, and
Mrs. H. Donald Winbigler, who dis
played her usual spirit and charm in
two Spanish dances.
