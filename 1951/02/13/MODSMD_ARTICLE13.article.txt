## Army Man Describes Atom Death 
### 
Stanford's seven civilian de
fense division heads heard de
scriptions of violent destruction
| and saw graphic presentations
of atomic death, as Major Don
ald Herbert of the Sixth Army
spoke on "Organization of a
i Community for Defense Against
Atomic Attack" last night in
| Palo Alto.
The seven were part of an esti
mated 200 Army and WAC reservists
and civilians v/ho heard Herbert's
talk at the regular reserve meeting.
Attempting to estimate realistically
the power of the bomb, Major Herb
ert said while it is a giant bomb, with
tremendous destructive possibilities,
its effects have sometimes been ex
aggerated, especially ils radioactive
powers.
Main Bomb Damage
| Main damage from the bomb comes
from blast and heat which produce
i 85 per cent of the casualties, he said.
Herbert told of a rising ball of fire
I at a temperature of 300,000 degrees
I Centigrade, sufficient to vaporize
j anything in its path.
j He told of an 800 m.p.h. wall of
wind emanating from an A-bomb
blast powerful enough to level build
ings, pick up autos and large tim
bers; but he also told of A-bomb de-
J fense.
Outlining a city defense system on
a departmentalized basis, Herbert
presented a scheme composed of
some 20 units—medical, fire, public
i works, evacuation, among them—un
! der supervision of five deputies, in
turn co-ordinated by a director of
civil defense.
Farm Setup Parallels
The setup is closely paralled on a
| smaller scale by Stanford seven di
visions—fire, feeding, housing, medi
cal, liaison, public utilities — each
I with a division head.
Herbert, using charts and other
visual aids, detailed three aspects of
defense from the manifold effects of
i the bomb—protective, relief, and re
| habilitation, pointing out that the ef
fects of attack do not end with the
actual blast of the bomb, but poten
tial death lingers in radioactive par
t tides.
He named four essentials of an ef
; fective defense program:
1. A dependable warning system;
2. An adequate number of prop
erly constructed shelters;
3. Public education; and
1. Organization and training before
attack.

Herbert, using charts and other
visual aids, detailed three aspects of
defense from the manifold effects of
i the bomb—protective, relief, and re
| habilitation, pointing out that the ef
fects of attack do not end with the
actual blast of the bomb, but poten
tial death lingers in radioactive par
t tides.
He named four essentials of an ef

1. A dependable warning system;

Stanford's seven civilian de
fense division heads heard de
scriptions of violent destruction
| and saw graphic presentations
of atomic death, as Major Don
ald Herbert of the Sixth Army
spoke on "Organization of a
i Community for Defense Against
Atomic Attack" last night in
| Palo Alto.
The seven were part of an esti
mated 200 Army and WAC reservists
and civilians v/ho heard Herbert's
talk at the regular reserve meeting.
Attempting to estimate realistically
the power of the bomb, Major Herb
ert said while it is a giant bomb, with
tremendous destructive possibilities,
its effects have sometimes been ex
aggerated, especially ils radioactive
powers.
Main Bomb Damage
| Main damage from the bomb comes
from blast and heat which produce
i 85 per cent of the casualties, he said.
Herbert told of a rising ball of fire
I at a temperature of 300,000 degrees
I Centigrade, sufficient to vaporize
j anything in its path.
j He told of an 800 m.p.h. wall of
wind emanating from an A-bomb
blast powerful enough to level build
ings, pick up autos and large tim
bers; but he also told of A-bomb de-
J fense.
Outlining a city defense system on
a departmentalized basis, Herbert
presented a scheme composed of
some 20 units—medical, fire, public
i works, evacuation, among them—un
! der supervision of five deputies, in
turn co-ordinated by a director of
civil defense.
