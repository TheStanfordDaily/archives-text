# Spaulding Lauds Red Cross Aid
## Varied Help Given GI's 
### RALPH HANDY 
Women at Lagunita and Union i
got the word on the Red Cross
yesterday from Bill Spaulding, a
graduate student in the Business
School who knows what he's
talking about.
Spaulding was caught up in the
Battle of the Bulge when the 84th
Infantry Division was thrown in to
plug up the gap punched in Ameri
can lines by the counterattacking
Germans.
On Jan. 3, 1945, Spaulding was
scouting ahead of his squad in the
Ardennes Forest when an artillery
bur.it put him out of action with If)
pieces of shrapnel in his legs.
"I was bleeding and I had a shoe
full of blood, but I was still able to
walk," Spaulding said.
Atop a Tank
He was removed from the front
lines to an aid station by hanging on
the top of a tank as it ran a gauntlet
of machine gun fire.
Five operations and nine months
later, Spaulding was out of the hos
pital with a 50 per cent disability !
discharge.
"I'm speaking today because I feel I
that I can never repay the Red Cross
financially for what they did for me. |
I'm trying to pay back some of what
I owe by donating myself, my time,
my money, and my blood," Spaulding j
told his audience.
Spaulding has no exact idea of the j
numerous pints of blood he received
at aid station and hospitals.
Spaulding had high praise for the
Red Cross women who stuck to their !
jobs under V-one fire at evacuation
hospitals in Liege, Belgium.

"Lying flat on our backs, wc could
hear the buzz bombs coming over,
sounding just like washing machines.
As long as the motor was going it
was okay, but when the motor cut
out, you knew they were on their
way down. The 10 seconds between

the silence and the blast were ter
rific."
The army did a fine job healing
men's bodies, but the Red Cross took
care of their minds, Spaulding de
clared.
"The Army is impersonal by na

ture, and the doctors and nurses and
other hospital personnel have more
than they can handle. Especially
overseas, there arc no friends to
lighten the hours, so the Red Cross
provides for a vital need. Books,
j movies, service clubs, personal needs,
j are all taken care of by the Red
j Cross."
Back to the U.S.
Returning from England to the
United States after three months in
English hospitals. Spaulding found
the Red Cross in operation even on
hospital ships.
The Red Cross had charge of rec
reation activities on shipboard just
as in hospitals, and according to
Spaulding set up projectors and
j showed movies to wounded who were
confined to their Bxlo staterooms and
couldn't get to the regular showings.
Rooks and other reading matter
were distributed regularly through
out service hospitals by the Red
Cross also provided for some degree
of occupational therapy to help re
covering patients pass the time.
Servirc Club
'"Let's go down to the Red Cross.'
I heard that so often and said it my
self so often," Spaulding said. He
was referring to the Red Cross-run
; service club that is a feature of the
service hospital.
"Ambulatory patients could 'go
| down to the Rod Cross' for dancing,
I reading, games, or just for loafing. I
danced at the Red Cross before I got
around to walking again," he com
! mcntcd.
Spaulding also credited the high
, percentage of just disability settle
ments to Red Cross help. The Army
provides the forms and the Red Cross
I does the rest, he said.
"The Red Cross has done and is
doing so much for wounded and dis
abled veterans, it deserves all the
help it can get from everyone, espe
cially in these times. The Red Cross
is doing a great job," Spaulding con-
I eluded.
Take it from a guy who knows.
