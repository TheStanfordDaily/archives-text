# Additions Made To Theta Chi Zoo
## 
### JIM MADISON 
The Theta Chi house, perennial
campus zoo, added a sequel Monday
night to last year's episode of the
polecat, goose, and three cats.
At 10:30 p.m. Gail Fraities dis
covered a hen on the sleeping
porch. Just how it got there re
mains a mystery, but the pledges
are suspected.
Fraities put the lien on Wally
White's bed, where she stuck her
head under a wing and settled
down for the night. When White
returned several hours later, he
dumped the bird unceremoniously
onto the floor. Showing a tractable
disposition, she immediately went
back to sleep.
There were no further disrup
tions during the night, although
the hen's appearance in the morn
ing led several of the brothers to
fear DT's.
The Theta Chi hospitality came
to an abrupt end when Mac, the
house chef, killed, cleaned, and
dressed the hen, then bartered it
for five plump ducksâ€”last night's
dinner.
