Women living on the Row, Union Residence and Union Units, and
men from Encina, Stern, Toyon, and Crothers are invited to report
between 1 and 5 p.m. for the first of their series of free tetanus
and typhoid shots.
The shots are offered toall those who wish them as a preparatory

civilian defense measure. Dr. George
Houck, director of the Health Serv
ice, urges all women to take the
shots. He advised men who will be
going into the armed services within
the next few months "not to bother"
—they'd just get a double dose.
Booster shots, which will reinforce
the previous shots, will be given to
veterans and students who traveled
to Europe last year and took the
series then.

Dr. Houck emphaszed that not
more than five students in 1000 should
have a "bad reaction" to the typhoid
shots. Those who do, he said, may
feel a little rocky for a day or two,
but the shots should not aftect the
students in such a way as to inter
fere with daily routine.
The tetanus shots incur no reac
tion.
