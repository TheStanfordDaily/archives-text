# Red Cross Collections At $365 After One Day
## Alpha Sigs Hit 100% Mark As Drive Continues Today 
### 
This morning Stanford's Red Cross drive enters the second day
of its week-long campaign.
Collections through the first day totaled $364.71, according to
Kay Wold, student chairman of the Farm's 1951 campaign. This
figure includes the proceeds from Friday night's Student-Faculty

Talent Show and a donation from
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity repre
senting contributions from 100 per
cent of its membership.
Monday's total fell far short of
$667 daily average necessary if the
Farm is to attain its $4,000 goal by
the end of this week. Meanwhile,
Stanford's campaign is not lying dor
mant.
In a special effort to facilitate do
nations from ofT-campus students, a
booth will be open tomorrow and
Thursday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in
front of the Law School and Business
School on Outer Quad.
Rohle's Part
Tomorrow, 25 Roble women who
have volunteered specially for the
job will canvass married students'
headquarters in the Village in an ef
fort to see that no student group is
overlooked. 4
Stanford's goal of $4,000 is a part
of a $40,983 total requested of the
Palo Alto area. This in turn is a part
of the national Red Cross goal of
$85,000,000.
This year, in response to a request
by the government, war emergency
programs will receive special empha
sis from the Red Cross, but the chari
table organization will also continue
its multiple peacetime activities.
National Work
Stanford has already responded to
some of the other national Red Cross
activities besides the present mone
tary effort. These include blood
collection, civil defense planning,
first aid groups, and similar tasks.
All of these functions are at least
partially dependent on financial
backing, however, and hence the
current drive.
The local campaign is scheduled
currently instead of at the same time
as the national drive beause the lat
ter will be in March when it would
conflict with dead week, finals, and
spring vacation.
Instead of resorting to car washes,
tag days, and similar tactics em
ployed in other years, the 1951 cam
paign at the Farm is based on the
idea of more complete coverage by
means of personal canvassing.
