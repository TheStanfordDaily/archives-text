# BULL SESSION
## Good Saint Valentine Would be Shocked! 
### EARL ODELL 
1 used to like* Valentine's Day. It Wiis real senti
•tientitl. Maybe a little mushy sometimes, but in those
lays when we were just learning how to wink or
Suiter our eyelashes, a little card with a "Roses are
0(J. Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet, And do are you"'

motif was very effective. Some
iines it even meant a chalk-writ
.(n heart and initials on the side
walk. All of which made us walk
on clouds, though we'd never ad
::nit it.
Maybe I'm growing up. I don't
aiow, but Valentine's Day just
isn't the same any more. Now the
poem reads, "Roses are red, Vio-

lets are blue, Orchids cost too much, And youre a
bum, anyway."
If you think differently, just take a look at what
the Stanford Bookstore Is putting out these days in
the way of Valentine cards. On the face of one card
you see, "Did I ever tell you I like you?" You look
inside and its says,"I never will!" Touching.
Then there's the one that says, "Love is like this,
Valentine," and inside it reads, "You never know when
it's going to strike you," but you never get a chance
to read that because a mousetrap in the card breaks
your thumb.
They ought to rename February 14th "Jokers'
I Lit - If a Day." It's real funny to receive a card these
days that has pretty flowers for a border ami the
Words "I love you" on the face and the continuation,
"to stay away from me," on the inside. Funny! Ha!
Ha!
IV* getting so that nowadays if you tell a girl that
you like her, you're immediately investigated for sub
versive activities. Oh. there are some nice little senti
mental ones. Take the one at the Bookstore, for in
stance, that reads, "What makes you think I wooden

spoon?" and on the inside, "Just try me out some
night real soon." You take the person up on it, though,
and you wind up paying hush money.
1 guess it's too late now to change things, but I for
one sure would like to see tlie days return where a
swift kick in the you-know-what didn't mean "Be
my Valentine."
What with all this atomic bomb stuff floating around,
maybe this is the beginning of a Back-to-the-cave
Movement, but I wish somebody would tell me. I
want to know what to send my girl for Valentine's
Day. If I send her a box of candy and a little note
saying. "Please be my Valentine," will she think I'm a
square, or maybe a little odd? Will she immediately
drop me for some lug who sends a Bookstore Valen
tine that reads. "Valentine, my love for you is . . ."
with "true" and "false" all over it.and on the inside
a big "False, lia! Ha!"
Suppose, for example, freshman Joshua Snikle
heimer is hot for Gloria Twinklebody who's in his
Western Civ class. February 14th rolls around and
he wants to make a good impression on her in hopes
of getting a date. So he goes over to the Stanford
Bookstore and buys up the first pretty Valentine card
he sees.
Thi«* one's got a hole in the middle of the outside
cover and a nice mirror peeping through. Cute little
verse on the outside, foo: "If you peek in this mirror,
You'll get a good view—Of the the face that I see—
When Tin looking at you."
Lttle does Josh realize (for what man would read
that mushy stuff on the inside, anyway?) that when
Gloria receives the card and opens it, a monkey ap
pears in the mirror and the inside reads, "Nuts to
you!" The question is, will Josh get the date?
Maybe this is a subversive plot of the Stanford
Bookstore to stop an increase in the world population.
Anyway, please be my Valentine, you erum!

Suiter our eyelashes, a little card with a "Roses are
0(J. Violets are blue, Sugar is sweet, And do are you"'

motif was very effective. Some
iines it even meant a chalk-writ
.(n heart and initials on the side
walk. All of which made us walk
on clouds, though we'd never ad
::nit it.
Maybe I'm growing up. I don't
aiow, but Valentine's Day just
isn't the same any more. Now the
poem reads, "Roses are red, Vio-

lets are blue, Orchids cost too much, And youre a
bum, anyway."
If you think differently, just take a look at what
the Stanford Bookstore Is putting out these days in
the way of Valentine cards. On the face of one card
you see, "Did I ever tell you I like you?" You look
inside and its says,"I never will!" Touching.
Then there's the one that says, "Love is like this,
Valentine," and inside it reads, "You never know when
it's going to strike you," but you never get a chance
to read that because a mousetrap in the card breaks
your thumb.
They ought to rename February 14th "Jokers'
I Lit - If a Day." It's real funny to receive a card these
days that has pretty flowers for a border ami the
Words "I love you" on the face and the continuation,
"to stay away from me," on the inside. Funny! Ha!
Ha!
IV* getting so that nowadays if you tell a girl that
you like her, you're immediately investigated for sub
versive activities. Oh. there are some nice little senti
mental ones. Take the one at the Bookstore, for in
stance, that reads, "What makes you think I wooden

spoon?" and on the inside, "Just try me out some
night real soon." You take the person up on it, though,
and you wind up paying hush money.
1 guess it's too late now to change things, but I for
one sure would like to see tlie days return where a
swift kick in the you-know-what didn't mean "Be
my Valentine."
What with all this atomic bomb stuff floating around,
maybe this is the beginning of a Back-to-the-cave
Movement, but I wish somebody would tell me. I
want to know what to send my girl for Valentine's
Day. If I send her a box of candy and a little note
saying. "Please be my Valentine," will she think I'm a
square, or maybe a little odd? Will she immediately
drop me for some lug who sends a Bookstore Valen
tine that reads. "Valentine, my love for you is . . ."
with "true" and "false" all over it.and on the inside
a big "False, lia! Ha!"
Suppose, for example, freshman Joshua Snikle
heimer is hot for Gloria Twinklebody who's in his
Western Civ class. February 14th rolls around and
he wants to make a good impression on her in hopes
of getting a date. So he goes over to the Stanford
Bookstore and buys up the first pretty Valentine card
he sees.
Thi«* one's got a hole in the middle of the outside
cover and a nice mirror peeping through. Cute little
verse on the outside, foo: "If you peek in this mirror,
You'll get a good view—Of the the face that I see—
When Tin looking at you."
Lttle does Josh realize (for what man would read
that mushy stuff on the inside, anyway?) that when
Gloria receives the card and opens it, a monkey ap
pears in the mirror and the inside reads, "Nuts to
you!" The question is, will Josh get the date?
Maybe this is a subversive plot of the Stanford
Bookstore to stop an increase in the world population.
Anyway, please be my Valentine, you erum!
