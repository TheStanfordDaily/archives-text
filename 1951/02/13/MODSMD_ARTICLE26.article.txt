To the Editor:
In last Thursday's Daily (Feb. 8) your report of a
KZSU foreign-student show mutilated the names of
two French students. One of the girls is called Nicole
Provost by those who knew her. You called her "Co
lette Nical." The other student. Philippe Berthet.
spells his name Philippe Berthet. You wrote it
"Berohter" which, by the way, mean "fresh" in Per
sian.
Yours for future accuracy,
KHODADAD FARMANFARMAIAN
(Misspelling is our commonest fault, and we must
apologize to scores of readers whose names are "mu
tilated. Thanks to reader Farmanfarmaian, how
ever, for his own name, which is the best "test" of
future accuracy we've bad in some time.â€”The Edi
tor.)
