To the Editor:
Contrary to rumor and Daily headline writers,
Buckley and I do not really hate children. Our res
ervations are limited to a particular Swedish picture
about them.
With regard to Allegra Mcßirney's letter in Friday's j
Daily, we appreciate that any article of opinion is 1
subject to serious disagreement—and Miss Mcßirney
has raised some valid points within our area of dis
agreement. But I would be especially interested in :
seeing her cite chapter and verse of other reviewers
(besides the Sun Francisco Chronicle) which reported
favorably on "The Children." I spent a couple of hours
over the weekend tracing newspaper and magazine 1
reviews in the Library, finding no reports to support
her.
Perhaps Buckley and I, as she puts it, do support
each other, tut who besides the Chronicle does Miss
Mcßirney have?
Allegro, Allegra!
