# Professor Pauses Here In 'Round the World Trip
## 
### TOM NEVILLE 
Sir George Bailey Sansom, head of the East Asian Institute at
Columbia University, now spending a short vacation here as the
guest of Stanford's History Department, has just finished an aca
demic tour of Southeastern Asia, a trip that eventually will take
him around the world.
Two months ago Sir George left England, traveled to India,

wound hi.s way through Southeastern
Asia to Japan, and last week arrived
in San Francisco.
"I spent most of my time lecturing
at the University of Tokyo on Far
Eastern history during this trip," the
modest, blue-suited scholar re
marked. Sir George was also the
leader of the United Kingdom dele
gation to the Lucknow Conference in
India last October, which was at
tended by several Stanford profes
l sors.
Pacific Voyage
"I've been at sea for the last two
or three weeks." he said, "and so I'm
not up to date politically. We sailed
Straight across the Pacific from Yo
kohama without stopping. There
were eight of us altogether on a
small United States freighter, the
ideal way to travel."
Sir George's academic duties did
not prevent him from making a few
' observations about the current Japa
nese viewpoint. "They feel helpless,
; that they can do nothing," he com-
I men ted.
"The occupation has served its
I purpose and is now giving diminish
ing returns. Materially Japan is in a
much better condition than it was
three or four years ago. but there is
! obviously in Japan a feeling of anx-
I iety as to the outcome of the hos
tilities in Korea.
Diplomatic Career
"I'm not very optimistic about the
' prospect of a negotiated settlement

I with China," he continued, "although
every effort should be made."
Sir George's education at prepara
tory schools and lycees in England
I and France and his work at the Uni
| versities of Marburg and Giessen in
I Germany subsequently led to a dip
lomatic career which officially ended
i in 1947.
He wys the British Consul in Japan
for 10 years, British Minister at
Washington from 1942 to 1947, and
; the United Kingdom member of the
Far East Commission of the Allied
Body for Control of Japan.
"When I think of the wretched cli
mate my students back East have to
j work in," the British scholar said,
! gazing out the window of Stern Hall's
guest room, "it makes me envy you
here at Stanford. You are extremely
j favored."

Sir George's education at prepara

"When I think of the wretched cli

guest room, "it makes me envy you

j favored."
Sir George Bailey Sansom, head of the East Asian Institute at
Columbia University, now spending a short vacation here as the
guest of Stanford's History Department, has just finished an aca
demic tour of Southeastern Asia, a trip that eventually will take
him around the world.
Two months ago Sir George left England, traveled to India,

wound hi.s way through Southeastern
Asia to Japan, and last week arrived
in San Francisco.
"I spent most of my time lecturing
at the University of Tokyo on Far
Eastern history during this trip," the
modest, blue-suited scholar re
marked. Sir George was also the
leader of the United Kingdom dele
gation to the Lucknow Conference in
India last October, which was at
tended by several Stanford profes
l sors.
Pacific Voyage
"I've been at sea for the last two
or three weeks." he said, "and so I'm
not up to date politically. We sailed
Straight across the Pacific from Yo
kohama without stopping. There
were eight of us altogether on a
small United States freighter, the
ideal way to travel."
Sir George's academic duties did
not prevent him from making a few
' observations about the current Japa
nese viewpoint. "They feel helpless,
; that they can do nothing," he com-
I men ted.
"The occupation has served its
I purpose and is now giving diminish
ing returns. Materially Japan is in a
much better condition than it was
three or four years ago. but there is
! obviously in Japan a feeling of anx-
I iety as to the outcome of the hos
tilities in Korea.
Diplomatic Career
