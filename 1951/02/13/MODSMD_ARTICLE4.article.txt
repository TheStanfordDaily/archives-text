WASHINGTON — President Tru
man strongly urged Congress today
to take "immediate steps" to send
millions of bushels of relief grain to
famine-stricken India in the name of
humanity and to help strengthen
"free institutions" in Asia."
The President said India has spe
cial claim on American sympathies
at this time. Unless help is forth
coming, he said, India's effort to
build a democratic government will
be seriously hampered at a time
when Communist aggression is on
the march over much of Asia.
