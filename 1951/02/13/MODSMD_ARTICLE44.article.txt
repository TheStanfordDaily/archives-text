# Card Trackmen Strong in Weights; Lew Davis Among Best Shot-putters
## 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
Editor's note: This is the first in
a series of articles discussing the
prospects of Stanford's track team
in the earning season. The series !
will he covered hv Dwight Wilbur
and Keith Mulvoouey. Today's
events: shot put and discus.
"This year's track squad has the
greatest weight nien in the country: j
from a standpoint of depth they're i
the best team of all time." These i
Were the words of Head Track Coach :
Jack Weiershauser as he reminisced !
recently about the brilliant pros
pects for his musclemen in the com- I
ini4 season.
They were also the words of a
coach in the enviable position of

having more star performers than he
could use. For NCAA rules allow a
school to enter only three men per
event in a duel meet. Therefore
Weiershauser must choose h.is dis
cus throwers from among four or
possibly five men who he says will
toss better than 150 ft.
In the shot put .his problem is a
little easier—but he isn't suffering
from a short bench in this event
either. The head mentor says three
men will be putting over 50 ft.

The weightmen and their best i
! marks are:
SHOT PUT

Chuck Hokanson ... 50ft. !) :I »in.

lan Heed 158 ft. *4 in.
Bob Mathias 157 ft. !) :l i in. j
Jack Burke 151 ft.
Frank Bradley 141! ft.
Chuck Renfro 142 ft.
No one can really say Weiershau
j ser has the problem of an all-senior
squad either. Three of the discus- ,
tossers, Reed, Mathias. and Renfro,
are only sophomores. Hokanson in
the shot is a junior.
The Indians' greatest competition
in these events will come from SC. ;
which has three 50-ft. shot-putters
and one discus-thrower over 170 ft.
The SC lineup looks like this, some

I of the marks being only approxi-
I mate:
SHOT PUT
Jess Swope s:t ft. 4 in.
Parry O'Brien ! 511 ft. 10 in.
Bob VanDoren 50 ft.
Elmer YVilhoUc 4rtit.
DISCUS

Elmer Wilhoite 144 ft.
Parry O'Brien 1.15.ft.
Against the Trojans the Cards fig
ure to take first and third in the shot
and second and third in the discus,
which would make a score of 10 to 8
in favor of Stanford.
When asked to venture a predic
tion as to how his charges would do
in this year's NCAA championships,
: Weiershauser said, "I can only tell
| you what our boys will do. You
never know what another school
may come up with. Both Reed and

Mathias will throw beyond 160 ft. 1
Davis will throw ft."
Then, relenting a little, he said, |
"We could get two or possibly three
places in the discus: Davis has a good ■
chance lor first in the shot.''
It is noteworthy that these
"mighty musclemen" are carrying
on an old Stanford tradition of hav
ing championship weightmen. Only
last year Stanford set a world's rec
ord by having four shot-putters in
one school bettering 50 ft.
Twice in history Card discus
twirlers have set world's records.
One shot - putter has established a
world mark. Seven times Indian dis- |
cus-throwers have copped the NCAA !
title and live times the AAU crown, j
In the shot, five men have nabbed j
NCAA laurels.
Weiershauser said that, contrary 1
to rumors, Mathias will definitely j
compete lor Stanford this spring, j

No one can really say Weiershau
j ser has the problem of an all-senior
squad either. Three of the discus- ,
tossers, Reed, Mathias. and Renfro,
are only sophomores. Hokanson in
the shot is a junior.
The Indians' greatest competition
in these events will come from SC. ;
which has three 50-ft. shot-putters
and one discus-thrower over 170 ft.
The SC lineup looks like this, some

I of the marks being only approxi-
I mate:
SHOT PUT
Jess Swope s:t ft. 4 in.
Parry O'Brien ! 511 ft. 10 in.
Bob VanDoren 50 ft.
Elmer YVilhoUc 4rtit.
DISCUS
Sim In ess 171 ft.
Elmer Wilhoite 144 ft.
Parry O'Brien 1.15.ft.
Against the Trojans the Cards fig
ure to take first and third in the shot
and second and third in the discus,
which would make a score of 10 to 8
in favor of Stanford.
When asked to venture a predic
tion as to how his charges would do
in this year's NCAA championships,
: Weiershauser said, "I can only tell
| you what our boys will do. You
never know what another school
may come up with. Both Reed and

Mathias will throw beyond 160 ft. 1
Davis will throw ft."
Then, relenting a little, he said, |
"We could get two or possibly three
places in the discus: Davis has a good ■
chance lor first in the shot.''
It is noteworthy that these
"mighty musclemen" are carrying
on an old Stanford tradition of hav
ing championship weightmen. Only
last year Stanford set a world's rec
ord by having four shot-putters in
one school bettering 50 ft.
Twice in history Card discus
twirlers have set world's records.
One shot - putter has established a
world mark. Seven times Indian dis- |
cus-throwers have copped the NCAA !
title and live times the AAU crown, j
In the shot, five men have nabbed j
NCAA laurels.
Weiershauser said that, contrary 1
to rumors, Mathias will definitely j
compete lor Stanford this spring, j


LEW DAVIS
—Best in the country?
