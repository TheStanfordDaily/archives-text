Stanford's varsity basketballers
returned Irom the Southland with
two casualties — their won-and-lost
record and Coach Everett Dean.
Dean was shelved with a touch of
the flu but should be back today to
lead the Indians through the first of
three strenuous workouts.
The Trojans handed the Cards a
double setback, and the Deanmen
return to the Southland again this
week to meet the fast-breaking UC
LA Bruins. Stanford split, with UC
LA when they were here, but the
Westwooders are always hard to
beat in their home territory.
The Bruins will be spearheaded by
sophomore Don Ridge way, who took
the league scoring honors away from
Ed- Tucker several weeks back.
