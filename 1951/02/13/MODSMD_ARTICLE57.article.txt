•
"What should be the responsibility
of the federal government toward
the preservation of harmonious la
bor - management relations?" was
the question discussed at the Bay
Area Debate Conference series of
round-table discussions Friday eve
ning in Cubberley.
Representatives from Cal, COP,
St. Mary's, Santa Clara, USF, and
San Jose State were divided into five
groups of six or seven, each moder
ated by members of the Stanford
Debate Association.
Conclusions of all groups were not
the same; however, ideas of one
sample group reflected the general
train of thought concerning the ex
tent of government intervention,
agreeing that the trend may be to
ward too much intervention in ordi
nary times, although this condition
may be due to increasing centraliza
tion in both industry and govern
ment. In cases of small companies
not affecting large sections of the
economy the government should in
tervene only when requested; it then
should only make recommendations.
In emergencies, unions directly
affecting the economy should be
limited in their right to strike; nev
ertheless the government has a defi
nite responsibility to correct any
abuses. Fact-finding boards should
be set up to make recommendations,
which both labor and management
should be compelled to carry out.
