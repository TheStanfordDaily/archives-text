CINCINNATI, (). â€”Major Alexan
der de Seversky, one of the nation's
foremost air experts, proposed an air
.siege against the North Koreans in
an interview here today.
Seversky said his proposal if car
ried out would "starve the North
Koreans into revolting against their
masters" and end the Korean war.
The air specialist said such a siege
would form a pattern against all
Communist - affected areas and
"eventually against Russia herself."
