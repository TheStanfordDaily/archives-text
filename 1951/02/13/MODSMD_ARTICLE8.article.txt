# TUESDAY EVENING SERIES
## Orchesis Show to Feature Original Student Dances 
### 
Tonight at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium, Orchesis will present
a concert of seven short dance numbers entirely composed and
executed by student members of the society. The program is a
part of the Tuesday Evening Series.
In addition to the regular women's ensemble, tonight's per-

formance will include nine men for
the first time in several years, ac
cording to Mrs. Miriam Lidster, fac
ulty director. "Members of the so
ciety take courses in choreography,
given in Stanford's Department of
Education," Mrs. Lidster commented.
"The first course is given to sopho
mores usually, but any interested |
student can enroll," she explained.
Most of the students have had little
or no experience. "Sometimes the
girls have had some ballet training."
Costumes, scenery, lighting, and
music are all arranged by students ,
majoring in the Art, Speech and |
Drama, or Music Departments. "The j
student-designed costumes often de- !
pend on what we have on hand,"
Mrs. Lidster noted.
Besides music by Virgil Thomson,
Alfred Newman, Jerome Kern, and
Stan Kenton, three of the numbers
were composed by Yncz Lynch and
Alex Horak, music majors. Miss
Lynch has written the music for a
"nonsense dance" choreographed by
Helen Gaylord, student director of
Orchesis. The piece is entitled "Aunt
Petunia and the Abstract."
Horak has written a suite of three
compositions for the opening num
ber, an abstract study. He has also
originated the music for an all-male J
dance choreographed by Terl Munch, j
a military satire called "G.I. Fan- \
tasy."
"Street Scene," with music by Al
fred Newman, was created by Joan
Hunt. It takes place in a crowdcd
quarter of a residential city street
with the interplay of the milkman,
the policeman, mothers and fathers, J
and other urban characters.
John Moore will narrate Virgil 1
Thomson's "7'he Plough Thai Broke
the Plains," with choreography by
Marilyn Sather. The program notes
explain, "Many brave people have
tried to make a living* farming the
Western plains; many have become i
discouraged: others stayed on."
Stan Kenton's "Fugue for Rhythm |
Section" will provide the back
ground for Medha von Essen's and
Sue Kelly's "Force, Counter-Force,"
The dance reveals the effects of rev
olutionary ideas on both "conserva
tive" and "easily persuaded" people, j
The program will end with "Meet
ing Place," described as "a dance of
many moods and many people."

Tuesday Evening Series program. The Art, Speech and Drama, and Music Departments have
collaborated with the dancers on their concert, which is directed by Mrs. Miriam Lidster, Or
chesis' faculty adviser. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson
Tonight at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium, Orchesis will present
a concert of seven short dance numbers entirely composed and
executed by student members of the society. The program is a
part of the Tuesday Evening Series.
In addition to the regular women's ensemble, tonight's per-

formance will include nine men for
the first time in several years, ac
cording to Mrs. Miriam Lidster, fac
ulty director. "Members of the so
ciety take courses in choreography,
given in Stanford's Department of
Education," Mrs. Lidster commented.
"The first course is given to sopho
mores usually, but any interested |
student can enroll," she explained.
Most of the students have had little
or no experience. "Sometimes the
girls have had some ballet training."
Costumes, scenery, lighting, and
music are all arranged by students ,
majoring in the Art, Speech and |
Drama, or Music Departments. "The j
student-designed costumes often de- !
pend on what we have on hand,"
Mrs. Lidster noted.
Besides music by Virgil Thomson,
Alfred Newman, Jerome Kern, and
Stan Kenton, three of the numbers
were composed by Yncz Lynch and
Alex Horak, music majors. Miss
Lynch has written the music for a
"nonsense dance" choreographed by
Helen Gaylord, student director of
Orchesis. The piece is entitled "Aunt
Petunia and the Abstract."
Horak has written a suite of three
compositions for the opening num
ber, an abstract study. He has also
originated the music for an all-male J
dance choreographed by Terl Munch, j
a military satire called "G.I. Fan- \
tasy."
"Street Scene," with music by Al
fred Newman, was created by Joan
Hunt. It takes place in a crowdcd
quarter of a residential city street
with the interplay of the milkman,
the policeman, mothers and fathers, J
and other urban characters.
John Moore will narrate Virgil 1
Thomson's "7'he Plough Thai Broke
the Plains," with choreography by
Marilyn Sather. The program notes
explain, "Many brave people have
tried to make a living* farming the
Western plains; many have become i
discouraged: others stayed on."
Stan Kenton's "Fugue for Rhythm |
Section" will provide the back
ground for Medha von Essen's and
Sue Kelly's "Force, Counter-Force,"
The dance reveals the effects of rev
olutionary ideas on both "conserva
tive" and "easily persuaded" people, j
The program will end with "Meet
ing Place," described as "a dance of
many moods and many people."
