I was |u:.t rlown at that
quaint little shop, RITA ON
RAMONA on Ramona St.
—and even though it's small,
RITA has the most wonder
ful array of clothes, styled
just for you, and priced for
your budget.
With the annual Row
Dance date coming up, you'll
have to drop in at RITA ON
RAMONA and see her excit
ing collection of dresses.
Among them, I saw a beauti
ful nylon marquisette dress
with a tailored waist and an
accordian pleated skirt —
baked in pleats— at that.
The color - the yummy new
orchid shade. A perfect
dress for many occasions.
You won't be able to resist
it. See you down at RITA'S.
