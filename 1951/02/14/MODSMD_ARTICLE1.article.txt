## MacArthur Tells Korea Strategy 
### 
TOKYO, Feb. 13 (UP) â€” Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur said today that
United Nations forces must inflict
"as heavy a punishment upon the
enemy as possible" before even con
sidering a crossing of the 38th paral
lel.
"Talk of crossing the 38th parallel
at the present stage of the campaign,
except by scattered patrol action in
cidental to the tactical situation, is
purely academic," the United Na
tions commander said after an air
and jeep visit to the fighting front
around Seoul.
In another indirect appeal to the
UN for permission to bomb Man
churia, Mac Arthur said his armies
in Korea were handicapped by their
inability to strike the Chinese Com
munist "sanctuary" beyond the
Manchurian border. .
