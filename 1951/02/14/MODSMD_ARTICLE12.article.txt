# New Dances Are Staged By Orchesis
## 
### 
An appreciative audience nearly
filled Memorial Auditorium last
night to view a program of original
modern dance compositions staged
by Orchesis. The program was part
of the Tuesday Evening Series.
The choreography for the pro
gram's sevÂ£n numbers was by Or
chesis members. Choreography rep
resents dancing through signs as
music is represented through notes.
"They Shall Reap the Whirlwind"
and "Aunt Petunia and the Ab
stract" received the greatest ovation
from the audience.
"They Shall Reap the Whirlwind"
was choreographed by Marilyn Sa
ther. John Moore narrated. The
music was from Virgil Thomson's
"The Plough That Broke the Plains."
"Aunt Petunia and the Abstract,"
a nonsense dance, was choreo
graphed by Helen Gaylord. The
music was written by Ynez Lynch,
Stanford student.
Other numbers were "Three to
Make Ready," choreographed by
Orchesis members; "Street Scene,"
choreographed by Joan Hunt? "G.I.
Fantasy," choreographed by Theo
dore Munch; "Force, Counter-
Force," choreographed by Suzanne
Kelly and Medha von Essen; and
"Meeting Place," choreographed by
Helen Gayord.
Costumes, scenery, lighting, and
music were arranged by art, speech,
drama, and music majors.
