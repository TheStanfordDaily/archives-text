# Opossom Fails to Play Possum; Bites Student

"Stanford students must be good to the taste," laughed Dr. George
Houck, director of the Health Service.
"I have had students in here bitten by dogs, cats, rats, mice, local
townspeople, and other students," he continued, "but last week we
topped them all."
One of the male members of the student body ran across an opossum
on campus one evening last week—or maybe the opossum ran across
him—neither party was quite sure how it happened.
This possum was not of the usual aloof variety. He did not feign
sleep according to what Dr, Houck termed the highest and best "ethics
of the opossum family." He bit the boy.
The student subsequently reported to the Health Service, very em
barrassed, where he became the first person treated there for possum
bite.
