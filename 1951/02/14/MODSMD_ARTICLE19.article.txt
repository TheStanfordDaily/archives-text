# Draft Revision Grants Month Induction Delay
## Balch Says Order 'Is Largely a Guess' 
### 
Chief Counselor for Men Richard L. Balch told
The Daily yesterday that the new ruling about
30-day postponements for enlistment was
"merely a suggestion of the conflict now going
on in Congress and is related to the overall

Manpower Mobilization Bill."
Balch emphasized the confusion
and uncertainty surrounding all
manpower problems now.
"Until the 18-year-old draft pro
posal and other mobilization propos
als are definitely settled, such orders
as the Selective Service ruling re-
Carding student enlistment are very
largely guesses," Balch said.
For instance, he pointed to the
many students here with 2-A classi
fications.
"In spile of all the programs
making enlistment possible, I
would advise 2-A men and other
non-seniors with postponements to
wait out the new mobilization act
from Congress," he said.
"By the end of the school year, all
students should have a much r-learÂ°r
idea of just where they stand with
their local board. Then will be the
best time to look into the problem of
enlistment," he added.
Balch did not belittle the signifi
cance of the recent rulings regarding
student enlistment, however.
"This latest ruling is not just an
effort to keep educational institutions
open; it. is an effort, to answer the
specific needs of a government that
has been successful in war becausc
of superior brainpower and not just
massed manpower," he said.
In the same light, he pointed out
the reasons behind the 30-day post
ponement allowing graduating stu
dents to look for jobs in essential
industries.
"The answer is obvious; indus
try is trying to insure against a
shortage of skilled labor supply
later on," he said. "This whole
question can be brought into focus
by consulting the Stanford Place
ment Office where applicants will
find that industry is taking promis
ing young college men despite their
possible call to military duty."
"The Military men as well as in
dustry have agreed upon this plan,"
he emphasized.
Balch once again emphasized the
hazard of trying to write workable
manpower rulings when the man
power policy of the nation is in a
confused state.
Until the Manpower Mobilization
Bill, due out of Congress in March
or April, is definitely settled upon,
piecemeal interpretation of our pres
ent situation will continue, he
stressed.
