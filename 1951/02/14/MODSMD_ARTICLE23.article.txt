# RED CROSS
## Drive Misses Daily Quota 
### 
Stanford's Red Cross drive limped
into its third day with a total re
ported collection of $557.77.
Yesterday's contributions totaled
$182.29, far short of the $667 daily
average necessary to bring the drive
to its $4,000 goal.
Men's residences—Crothers, Stern,
and Toyon—reported $139.46 at 3:30
p.m. yesterday. Women's residences
— Branner and Toyon — showed a
collection of $27.50.
Talent Show
The Student-Faculty Talent Show
last Friday netted the Red Cross
$350.77 and Monday's take was
$14.71, a 100 per cent contribution
from the Alpha Sig house.

Kay Wold, Red Cross drive
chairman, urges all living group
solicitors to turn in their receipts
daily rather than wait until all
students have been contacted.
Receipts should be turned in to
Marian Beaver, Red Cross drive
treasurer, in the Cardinals office
between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. daily.

A booth will be set up today and
tomorrow on the Outer Quad by the
Law and Business schools to receive
contributions from off-campus stu
dents. The booth will be open from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Twenty - five volunteer solicitors
from Roble will canvass married
students' quarters in the Village this
evening.
More Money Later
"More money should come in later
in the week, because solicitors seem
to be waiting until they can bring
their whole collection in at one
time," Kay Wold, Red Cross drive
chairman, said.
According to Miss Wold, this
year's drive is based on the idea of
intensified personal canvassing rath
er than the usual car washings, tag
days, and other tactics of past cam
paigns.
