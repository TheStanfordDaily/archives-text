# Students Allowed Additional 60 Days
## 
### 
The latest of many revisions of the draft law
allowing students to enlist in a service of their
choice was announced in Washington yesterday
by Selective Service.
The new ruling provides a 30-day postpone-

ment of induction following the end
of the school year for students sub
ject to the draft.
Students who have received their
induction notices and would nor
mally be drafted immediately after
finishing out the school year may
now have 30 days after the last day
of school this spring in which to en
list.
The basic change in the rule in
volves a switch in the period during
which students may enlist. For
merly the period was the 30 days
prior to the end of the academic year,
but now the enlistment period has
been set at the 30 days following the
end of the accWemic year.
Selective Service officials changed
the rule because they felt that the
new policy will allow students to
devote the entire final month to
studies without anv enlistment
problems hanging overhead.
Written applications from students
wishing to enlist should be made to
local draft boards, requesting can
cellation of induction orders. How
ever, Chief Counselor for Men Rich
ard L. Balch said yesterday there
was no need to rush letters to boards
yet.
Selective Service Director Lewis
B. Hershey issued the instructions ui
telegrams to all state directors of
Selective Service.
The telegrams summarized and ex
plained the instructions previously
issued regarding the privilege of en
listment order.
The new basic policy was origin
ally intended to apply only to stu
dents finishing their school year next
spring and summer.
Hershey said it was extended
Feb. 7, however, to cover students
now being graduated at mid-term
and thus subject to termination of
their statutory postponement.
Students graduating at the end of
this quarter who apply in writing for
cancellation in order to enlist also
have a 30-day postponement
period.
Enlistments may be in any speci
fied branch of the armed forces, in
cluding the Coast Guard.
The telegrams also explained a re
cent order granting postponement of
inductions to mid-year college grad
uates to enable those with highly
technical skills to find jobs in the de
fense program.
Regarding these students, a 30-day
postponement was ordered Jan. 26.
Hershey said this was because cer
tain jobs in the defense program are
unfilled, and some of the student,
graduating have the skills and spe
cial qualifications for such work.
Hershey said the 30-day post
ponement was ordered to give lo
cal boards authority to reopen all
deserving cases and time to screen
those who have found jobs in es
sential industry.
He added that it must be full-time
work in which the registrant cannot
be replaced, and in which his removal
would cause a material loss of effec
tiveness.
Meanwhile, Sen. Lyndon B.
Johnson, D., Tex., warned the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee to
day that there is a "great and im
mediate" need for an 18-year-old
draft now if Congress wants to
avoid inducting veterans and fath
ers.
Johnson is chairman of the Senate
Preparedness Committee, actually an
armed services subcommittee, which
voted 7 to 1 to draft 18-year-olds for
a minimum of 24 months' service.
