A Wort I of (lautioii . . .
Scattered bits of student, faculty, and admin
istration commentary have moved us to sub
mit a word of caution.
This year's Frosh-Soph Jamboree was unde
.liably a huge success. Mud fights, chameleon
like hair stylings, tree toads in Roble's halls,
and hasty kidnapings topped off a weekend
thai might otherwise have been labeled "strict
ly routine."
In all, there was lots of "tangible spirit" evi
denced by both classes. In many eyes, how
ever, the spirit was almost too tangible.
Harmless" kidnapings can result in serious
njury, note the experienced, while outright
combat might and has ended in broken bones,
in parallel, it is entirely too easy to cite the
recent curtailment of pajamarino activities—
simply because "things got out of hand."
There is no reason for the Frosh-Soph affair
'.o tread beyond common sense boundaries.
And yet it can easily do just that. If it does,
the administration will have a perfect right to
jump on our backs and tell us to quit—for good.
The reasons for such a termination would be
obvious. Still, here's one you may have over
looked. Every incident of Frosh-Soph or
Jamboree wildcatting can and has resulted in
nationwide publicity — printed words that do
damage to the Stanford name. Witness the
1947 Pajamarino fiasco. Headlines, many of
them big and bold, reached practically every
section of the nation, while stories accompany
ing them told of broken windows, broken
bones, mass lootings, etc., etc. ... ad infini
tum.
The Daily will continue to stand behind and
publicize the annual Jamboree. But a word of
caution to this year's frosh class when it be
gins mapping out next year's campaign:

Try to ORGANIZE your activities and set
definite dates and times for carrying them out.
If you tone down the high-pressure publicity
until a day or two before the fun-making and
schedule enough dances, milk-busts, and field
days, the combined effect should help to elim
inate much of the hazings and kidnapings that
have marked this year's event.
Above all, we'd ask you to make common
sense your watchword. It's all too easy to drive
a good thing into the ground.
We SHOULDN'T Fail . . .
It's a little late for plaudits on this one; nev
ertheless, the time is ripe. We're speaking of
the heartwarming success of last month's Red
Cross blood campaign on campus.
When students fall but six pints short of their
200-pint goal, and when a scant 17 out of 250
fail to keep appointments, the co-operation has
to be there. And we're sure the co-operation
, will be just as evident April 25 when the mobile
bank returns.
Right now, we're in the middle of a fund
raising drive for the Red Cross. Collections
are bogging down. An average of $667 per
day has to be realized or the drive will fall short
of its 34,000 goal.
In the first place, we don't think $4,000 is too
much to ask. With the nation's price level at
its present height, it is only fair to remember
that costs are higher for the Red Cross just as
they are for us.
Finally, $4,000 shouldn't be too much to ask
in view of the fact that there are some 7,500
of us here at Stanford. We would ask this ques
tion:
Is 50 cents out of pocket more of a sacrifice
than a half-hour or an hour spent giving blood?
We think not.
