# Special 'Y' Meeting Will Feature Talk on Theology
## 
### 
Stanford's infant YMCA group is coming of age at last, said
temporary planning committee president Jim Mansfield yester
day..
And to prove it, the Y is holding a special meeting tomorrow
night in the YWCA lounge in the Women's Clubhouse, with

i Alexander Miller, new Farm theol
j ogy lecturer, giving a talk on "The
i Relation of the Student 'Y' Move
j ment to the College Campus."
Miller, who is at present the
only lecturer on* theology on the
Stanford faculty, is u recent ar
rival here from New Zealand. He
is the author of "The Christian
Significance of Karl Marx," and
was a speaker at the last National
Assembly of the YMCA, held in
Oxford, Ohio.
Mansfield issued a special invita
tion to all men students interested
in the "Y" to attend the meeting.
After spending most of fall and
winter quarters holding semi-week
ly meetings, Mansfield said, the "Y"
planning committee has come up
with what it feels is a good constitu
tion. Now would be an excellent
time, he added, for new men to come
into the organization.
The planning committee, which
has been directing all "Y" affairs
to date, has decided to hold an
election at the beginning of spring
quarter and to turn all executive
functions over to the officers elect
ed then.
Then, Mansfield said, the "Y" can
begin a real program of activities
centered around the "Y" triangle of
service to the school, the community,
and the members, and the more lei
lows in the group the better.
