# Ferris Tells All Concerning Lice
## 
### 
The habits and hosts of different
species of lice and the effects lice
have on man highlighted Monday's
biology seminar entitled "The Suek
ing Lice," given by Dr. Gordon F.
Ferris, professor of biology.
"Any blood - sucking insect is of
importance in disease," Dr. Ferris
pointed out, "although only a few

known to ho transmitters."
Lice become adjusted to living on
certain species of hosts. In most
cases a sheep louse, for instance, will
never be found on a horse.
Dr. Ferris commented that it is
(lil)icuk to distinguish between some
species lound on man and monkeys
