### "DIGGER" ODELL 
We'd have felt left out if we hadn't made it a point to mosey over to the
BAC the other clay and chitchat with Chuck Taylor, new grid mentor.
Besides, we were wondering just what Chuck meant when he said, "We'll
operate ofi a strict T-formation."
Well, sir, it was just like everyone who's met him has said: there he was

with an outstretched mitt and a grin you could
see from the top of Hoover Tower. He was as
friendly as he could be and even made it a
point to see that he spelled our name correctly
as he wrote it down for future reference.
Right here and now we w&nt to step on the
toes of those who have a secret fear that
Chuck's too young for the job. That's the one
thing that a few people thought put Taylor
at a disadvantage when he accepted the job
as Marchie Schwartz's successor. But after
talking with Chuck for awhile, we believe that
hte 31 years will help him rather than hinder
him.
In the first place, the new headman has

the pep and vitality that no older man would probably have, and the oi'
get-up-and-go is just what's needed at the present time. The organiza
tional matters that Chuck has to deal with at present before he can set
loot on the gridiron would have many an older man—and even most
younger men—moaning. But not Chuck; that red thatch of his has got a
lot of ideas under it.
Taylor's major problem now is to see that the football players who
are now on the Farm don't git their "Greetings." He's seeing to it that
most of them are enrolling in a reserve program. After that's settled,
Chuck's next job will be to get the alumni program set up to get new
material to Stanford. The biggest thing in Taylor's favor is that he's not
new around here. He is well with the right people.
Wanting to know just what Chuck meant by a "strict T-formation," we
did the simplest thing we could think ok—we asked him. And he told us.
Next fall the Stanford Indians will field a T-formation team, but as
Chuck puts it, they'll have a "new look." That is to say. there will be
some variations. The line may shift a little differently, they may spread out
mofe, or they may play it tighter, depending on the situation at hand.
In the backficld. look for the halfbacks and fullback to do a lot of
passing and also more receiving. It will kike a lot of pressure off a guy
likt' Bill M<;Coll if are three or four men out instead of just a
couple of ends.
Another variation will be in the Hankers. Instead of a man-in-motion.
the flanker will probably be sent out from the huddle.
Chuck has also indicated that he is a devout platoon system follower, and
will use his staff for that purpose. His staff will include defensive and
offensive line coaches, and defensive and offensive backfield coaches.
Spring practice next month, according to Taylor, will be devoted to
fundamentals of blocking and tackling, and to experimentation. That
blocking and tackling sure sound good to us. If there's one thing we
can't get too much of, that's it.
Just what the Card grid team will look like next year no one knows, but
Irom this Corner it looks good. Down with the war, up with football!
