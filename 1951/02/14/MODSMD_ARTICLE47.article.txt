# Cards to Go South
## 
### 
Because of some strange doings on
the part of the schedule maker,
Stanford's basketeers will return to
the Southland for the second time
in two weeks â€” this time to meet
UCLA.
The Deanmen suffered a double
setback at the hands of the Trojans
last week and are going through
three strenuous workouts this week
in order to out-fast-break the fast
breaking Bruins.
The Westwooders will be spear
headed by soph sensation Dick
Ridgeway. Ridgeway is the confer
ence's leading scorer, with 123 points
in six games for a 20.5 average per
game.
Stanford, despite the fact that it
occupies the Southern Division cel
lar with Cal, has three representa
tives among the first seven high
scorers.
Eddie Tucker, who had a compar
atively bad time against the Trojans,
is runner -up to Ridgeway with
a 16.5 average. Bill Hagler of Cal is
third, and the Cards' Jim Ramstead
is fourth with a 13.1 average. Guard
Jim Walsh is seventh with 11.1
markers per game.
Stanford, in winning two and los
ing four, has chalked up 352 points
to its opponents' 418. UCLA, on the
other hand, has scored 361 to its op
ponents' 362.
