# STANFORD TRAINER SINCE 1946
## Connie Jarvis Faces Bruise-Filled Spring Season 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Meet that master mender of men,
he of the bow tie. white coat, and
little black bag. Stanford's own D.
Conrad Jarvis—athletic trainer, tier,
and taper.
In the room of whirlpools, infra
red ray lamps, and other training
paraphernalia Conrad alone is king.
To him have come the Yardleys,
Merrinians, Chandlers, and others to
be plastered, painted, and patched.
Emerging from a maze of adhesive
tape and gauze, they are sent out
again to the various fields of ath
letic conflict while their coaches
breathe another word of thanks to
the tireless trainer.
Shrine Game Trainer
Connie knows athletes from all
over America'—not only by name
but by their injuries. As Shrine
Game trainer for the West team, he
has applied his tape and linament to
more than one visiting All-Ameri
can. While Kyle Rote, the great
SMU halfback, was here with the
West team, he amazed Jarvis by los
ing five pounds a day. "Most rugged
guy around," says Connie, "but
Charlie Twogood, Nebraska tackle,
was the most bruised and injured

player I ever treated."
Spring is his most versatile season
when all he is responsible for is
track, baseball, swimming, golf, and

spring football. Oh, yes—tennis. At
this time of the year his training
quarters resemble the waiting room
at Grand Central Station. Strangely

enough, Connie believes tending to
the track team a.s time-consuming as
football. "Endless" is his one-word
: summation of it.
While an undergrad at Washing
| lon State College, Connie served as
assistant to Dr. Wilbur Bohm, now
one of baseball's top trainers. After
graduation in 1939 Connie went to
, Gonzaga University as head trainer.
; The wars came along, however, and
j Jarvis entered the school of aviation
medicine nt Randolph Field, Tex;*
In 194G he came here and went
| right to work on the basketball team.
■ One of his side jobs was caring for
Krankie Albert's flat feet.
Mathias Best Athlete
"Bob says Jarvis, "is the
| be:>t athlete I've seen, but 1 believe
j Larry Hoff showed the most courage
of any athlete when he came from
behind to defeat Wells DeLoach of
| USC in 1948. Larry was in a tre
| mendous amount of pain but ran a
fast 440 which was self-torture all
the way."
Jarvis resides in Menlo Park with
! his wife and two young sons, who he
| hopes someday will become Stan-
I ford athletic greats.
