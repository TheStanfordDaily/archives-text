# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## Bringing Up Alathon* 
### 
Du Pont scientists find
great promise in this young
member of the wax family
One of the most interesting and ver
satile of the new plastics is Du Pont
"Alathon" polythene resin, chemical
cousin of paraffin.
Because of its unusual combination
of properties, it is now being used in
everything from "squeeze-bottles"
for toiletries to cable insulation and
chemical-resistant lining:;.
"Alathon" was born when English
scientists used high-pressure synthe
sis to create polythene, the solid and
gemi-solid polymers of ethylene.
Du Pont scientists and others
added their background in high pres
sure work to the field of ethylene
polymers. This concerted effort pro
duced a greatly expanded range of
uses.
Taking First Steps
The first step of Du Pont chemists
and engineers was to produce poly
thene in the laboratory to confirm
earlier findings. Then the product
was turned over to chemical engi
neers for pilot-plant work. Finally, a
plant for full-scale commercial pro
duction was designed by chemical,
mechanical and electrical engineers
and metallurgists.
Many of the most promising uses

for "Alathon" could not be realized
until technical difficulties were over
come. For example, the chemical in
ertness, which is one of the outstand
ing properties of the material in film
form, also made the casting of film
from solution impractical because it
could not he dissolved in suitable
solvents. In devising a special extru
sion technique to solve this problem,
Du I'ont engineers opened up a whole
now field of possibilities.

Acid-Defying Paper
In film form, "Alathon" lends its
strength, chemical inertness and re
sistance to grease and moisture to
packages for chemicals, foods, metal
parts and moisture-sensitive pow
ders. In still another form in which
these properties are employed, paper
coated with "Alathon" is used as
wrapping for bakery products and
moistureproof containers for chem
icals thai would attack uncoated
paper. (Experimentally, "Alathon"
coated paper has been exposed to con
centrated sulfuric acid for days with
out harm; the same paper, uncoated,
was ruined within a few minutes.)
The protection of "Alathon" was
extended to metal tanks and drums
when Du Pont engineers developed
a spray-flaming coating technique.
In the field of electricity, too,
"Alathon" is proving of great value.
