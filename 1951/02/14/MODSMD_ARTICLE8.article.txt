# Typhoid, Tetanus Shots Start Today
## 
### 
Starting at 1 this afternoon and continuing every Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday afternoons until the end of spring quarter,
the Health Service is offering free typhoid and tetanus immuniza
tion.
This service would ordinarily cost about $15.
Women from the Row, Union Residence and Union Units, and

men from Encina, Stern, Toyon,
and Crothers are scheduled to start
their series of shots this afternoon.
Dr. George Houck and the Stu
dent Health Committee have ar
ranged this schedule by residence
areas in order to facilitate handling
the many students expected effi
ciently. However, students may
start their shots on any of the
three days.
Women students and those men
who will not be in the service
within the next few months are
especially urged to take the shots as
a preparatory civilian defense meas
ure. Men who will be inducted soon
will get the shots anyway.
Dr. Houck emphasized the advis
ability of typhoid immunization in
case of any large-scale disaster
such as might occur in case of war.
Typhoid is one of the worst dan
gers in any situation where the wa
ter supply might be disrupted.
Tetanus is offered as a preparatory
civilian defense measure, especially
because of Stanford's location. Since
it is built on an old horse farm, the
danger of tetanus is high in this area.
The Health Service is also planning
to give booster shots to those students
who have had shots previously in the
armed services or elsewhere.
Dr. Houck urged students to begin
the series as soon as possible because
active immunity from tetanus is not
reliable until five months after the
series has been completed. Active
immunity from typhoid occurs a few
weeks after the series.
Living units scheduled for tomor
row and Friday are:
Tomorrow afternoon — Lagunila,
Casa Ventura, Village, and off
campus women; Row and Village
men.
Friday afternoon — Bran nor and
Koblc women and off-campus men.
