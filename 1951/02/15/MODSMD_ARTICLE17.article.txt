# $1 Per Person Is Needed To Reach Red Cross Goal
## 
### 
Many students don't realize that
the Stanford Red Cross quota is
based on campus population alone,
not total student enrollment, Kay
Wold, drive chairman, said yester
day as the Red Cross drive contin
ued to lag at the end of the third day.
She attributed the so-far meager
support of the drive in part to the
fact that many students have divided
the $4,000 quota into approximately
8,000 students and come up with a
50-cent personal responsibility.
"Off-campus students are not in
cluded in the Stanford quota," Miss
Wold said. "We have less than 4,000
is to be anywhere near a success, the
people on campus, so the individual
quota is slightly over $1. If the drive
average contribution has to be at
least a dollar."
A booth will be open between 10
a.m. and 2 p.m. on Outer Quad by
the Law and Business schools for
off-campus contributions.
Miss Wold further asked solicitors
to intensify their efforts to reach ev
eryone in their living groups as
soon as possible.
Yesterday's total contribution
was $492.26, highest daily total ye)
reported, but still below the $677
daily average necessary to bring
the six-day drive to a successful
conclusion.
The take yesterday swelled the
four-day total to $1,050.03.
The returns to date by living
groups:
Alpha Sic, $14.71; Branncr, $27.80;

Crothers, $33.78; Encina, $19.01;
Fiji, $32; Jordan, $2.75; Lagunita,
$154.38; Madrono, $20.50; Phi Sig,
$25.33; Stern, $104.25; Storey, $17;
Toyon, $55.09; Union, $21; and Vil
lage, $171.6(5. The Student-Faculty

Talent Show netted $350.77.
Fijis with their $32 contribution
are the first living group to actually
hit a 100 per cent contribution, $1
from each of their members, Miss
Wold said.
A letter received recently by
Maryanna Peterson, director of
the Student Employment Service,
from a Red Cross girl now serving
in Korea illustrates the conditions
under which the Red Cross is op
erating in a combat area.
"... I was with an evacuation
hospital at Pusan through the days
when patients were streaming in at
800 per day ... we worked straight
through 24 hours every three days
plus full time the other two days
and snatched sleep when we could,"
the letter read.
"Seems funny to walk across a
bright moonlight field and hear
shooting in the hills," the letter con
tinued. "There was quite a bit of
shooting this afternoon, and there
have been more jets overhead than
usual tonight ... a very welcome
sound ...
"A tent-full of new patients, so
must go give them the good word,
candy, toilet articles, writing mate
rials, etc. So ends my little travel
ogue . . ."
Solicitors are reminded to turn
in their receipts to Red Cross
drive treasurer Marian Beaver in
the Cardinals office between 2:30
and 3:30 p.m. today and tomorrow.

A letter received recently by
Maryanna Peterson, director of
the Student Employment Service,
from a Red Cross girl now serving
in Korea illustrates the conditions
under which the Red Cross is op
erating in a combat area.
"... I was with an evacuation
hospital at Pusan through the days
when patients were streaming in at
800 per day ... we worked straight
through 24 hours every three days
plus full time the other two days
and snatched sleep when we could,"
the letter read.
"Seems funny to walk across a
bright moonlight field and hear
shooting in the hills," the letter con
tinued. "There was quite a bit of
shooting this afternoon, and there
have been more jets overhead than
usual tonight ... a very welcome
sound ...
"A tent-full of new patients, so
must go give them the good word,
candy, toilet articles, writing mate
rials, etc. So ends my little travel
ogue . . ."
Solicitors are reminded to turn
in their receipts to Red Cross
drive treasurer Marian Beaver in

Many students don't realize that
the Stanford Red Cross quota is
based on campus population alone,
not total student enrollment, Kay
Wold, drive chairman, said yester
day as the Red Cross drive contin
ued to lag at the end of the third day.
She attributed the so-far meager
support of the drive in part to the
fact that many students have divided
the $4,000 quota into approximately
8,000 students and come up with a
50-cent personal responsibility.
"Off-campus students are not in
cluded in the Stanford quota," Miss
Wold said. "We have less than 4,000
is to be anywhere near a success, the
people on campus, so the individual
quota is slightly over $1. If the drive
average contribution has to be at
least a dollar."
