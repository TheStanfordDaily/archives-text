# Another Year Added To Ed School Program
## 5-Year Study for Elementary Credential to Start Next Fall 
### 
A new five-year program for majors in elementary education
will be instituted by Stanford's School of Education next fall, Mrs.
Fannie R. Shaftel, sub-chairman of the elementary education pro
gram, announced yesterday.
Graduates under the new program will receive AB and MA de-

grees along with their credentials in
elementary education. Main purpose
of the program will be to provide
prospective teachers with more gen
eral as well as specialized training.
The present four-year program
now gives an AB in Education along
with the credentials. Juniors and
seniors in elementary education now
in the school will not be affected, nor
will those working for other degrees
in Education, said Mrs. Shaftel. At
present there is a required five-year
program for majors in secondary
education.
The present sophomore class will
be the first to be affected.
The announcement was made by
Mrs. Shaftel for Dean of the School
of Education A. John Bartky, who is
at present away on a two-week trip
to attend educational conferences in
San Diego and Atlantic City, N.J.
In adopting the plan, Stanford
will become one of the few schools
in (he country to require the MA ;
degree along with the AB for ele
mentary education degrees. Min
nesota and California now have
similar plans, Minnesota requir- ;
ing five years and Cal four and
one-half.
Impetus for the program has been
provided in large part by the profes
sion, Mrs. Shaftel said. The need for
a "more highly prepared person" at
the elementary level has long been
realized, she said.
The program will emphasize the
need for students in elementary edu
cation to gain experience in fields
other than education. It is proposed
that the students will "get a chance
to rub shoulders with people in busi
ness and industry as part of the gen
eral education program," said Mrs.
Shaftel.
In connection with this it proposed
that students will go to work in vari
ous fields other than education be
tween their fourth and fifth years in
the school.
Along this line of the program,
there arc plans to incorporate sup
plemental courses from other dc-,
partmcnts into the curriculum. At
present the Art and Music Depart
ments offer three courses each,
especally for elementary education
majors.
According to Mrs. Shaftel, the plan
is designed to act as "a pilot program
trying to demonstrate what ought to
go into the education of a skilled ele
mentary teacher."

Committee of the School of Educa
tion, which has participated in draw
ing up the plans for the new pro
gram. is Dr. Lucien B. Kinney, pro

is made up of students working at
the doctoral level.

a "more highly prepared person" at
the elementary level has long been
realized, she said.
The program will emphasize the
need for students in elementary edu
cation to gain experience in fields
other than education. It is proposed
that the students will "get a chance
to rub shoulders with people in busi
ness and industry as part of the gen
eral education program," said Mrs.
Shaftel.
In connection with this it proposed
that students will go to work in vari
ous fields other than education be
tween their fourth and fifth years in
the school.
Along this line of the program,
there arc plans to incorporate sup
plemental courses from other dc-,
partmcnts into the curriculum. At
present the Art and Music Depart
ments offer three courses each,
especally for elementary education
majors.
According to Mrs. Shaftel, the plan
is designed to act as "a pilot program
trying to demonstrate what ought to
go into the education of a skilled ele
mentary teacher."

A new five-year program for majors in elementary education
will be instituted by Stanford's School of Education next fall, Mrs.
Fannie R. Shaftel, sub-chairman of the elementary education pro
gram, announced yesterday.
Graduates under the new program will receive AB and MA de-

grees along with their credentials in
elementary education. Main purpose
of the program will be to provide
prospective teachers with more gen
eral as well as specialized training.
The present four-year program
now gives an AB in Education along
with the credentials. Juniors and
seniors in elementary education now
in the school will not be affected, nor
will those working for other degrees
in Education, said Mrs. Shaftel. At
present there is a required five-year
program for majors in secondary
education.
The present sophomore class will
be the first to be affected.

Mrs. Shaftel for Dean of the School
of Education A. John Bartky, who is

In adopting the plan, Stanford
will become one of the few schools
in (he country to require the MA ;
degree along with the AB for ele
mentary education degrees. Min
nesota and California now have
similar plans, Minnesota requir- ;
ing five years and Cal four and
one-half.
Impetus for the program has been
provided in large part by the profes
sion, Mrs. Shaftel said. The need for
a "more highly prepared person" at
the elementary level has long been
realized, she said.
