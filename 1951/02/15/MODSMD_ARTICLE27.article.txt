### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (UP) —
The Senate Armed Services Com
mittee voted unanimously today to
draft 18-year-olds for 26 months
service but stipulated that no draft
ees—regardless of age —could be
sent overseas without four months'
basic training.
Local draft boards would have to
exhaust their supply of eligible old
er men before inducting 18-year
olds.
The bill also would order draft
boards to call up as many 4-F's as
possible for limited service and
would wipe out present exemptions
for childless husbands and other
men with only one dependent. Vet
erans still would be draft-proof.
The measure gives military offi
cials authority to enlist 25,000 aliens
a year for five years. At the end of
their terms of service the aliens
would be eligible for citizenship.
Even if Congress approves the
bill, it probably will be months be
fore any 18-year-olds are called to
uniform. All draftees would be com
pelled to remain in the reserves for
six years after discharge, and con
scientious objectors could be called
for essential national service.
The bill now goes to the S.enat"
where it will not be considered until
the controversial troops-to-Europe
issue is settled—perhaps a matter of
weeks.
