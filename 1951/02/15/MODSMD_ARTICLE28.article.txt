Tickets for tonight's performance

the Memorial Hall Box Office for 75
| cents. Friday and Saturday nights'
! performances are sold out.
"Any Number Will Do," a comedy
I written by Ray Barrett, will open the j
show. This play, directed by John
j Brebner, tolls the amusing struggles j
of a lonely, but attractive, young girl j
to get a date.
The adventurous Peggy will be I
played by Jill Nishet. Her room
mate, skeptical of her date-getting
I methods, but later persuaded to try |
| them for herself, is played by Mar- j
j garet McKenna.
The date Peggy ultimately gels is j
Curt Hungerford. Others in the cast
are Milt Cohen and Nancy Copeland.
"Angel" Is Next
Peter Emmet's "Angel of the Lord"
j will be next on the program. The
j author has achieved an unusual ef-
I feel by inserting blank verse among
I he prose lines of the play. The ac
tion takes place at a cocktail party
i in a New York apartment. Ed Linck
directs this One-Act.
The host of the party, Dick Jones,
has invited an unsophisticated stu
dent, Roger Morris, to his party in
order to amuse the rest of the guests.
In the play, the callousness and
I falseness of the party-goers arc re
vealed.
Others acting in this play are Mary
i Strickland, Jo Gil berg, Jean Leonard,
Richard Fowler, Tom Fraser, and
Dick Cox.
Cherokee Setting
The action of "One Hundred Acres
I and a Man," bv Keith Kisk. takes

j place in the Cherokee Territory the

Hamilton is the girl who finds land
for herself and her brothers and sis
ter by vamping Slade Tuttle, ser
geant of the cavalry patrol, played
