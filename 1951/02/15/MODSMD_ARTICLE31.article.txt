(Editor's Note: Thanks to the "feudal absolutists,"
FORMERLY of Village 316, for the following.)
With shouts of "freedom from democratic-republi
can oppression," Ravenswood Hal!—formerly Building
!!1(J of Stanford Village—unanimously made itself a
new, independent, sovereign state last night.
Leaders of the new government declared that "all
ancient right of feoffment and tenure held by the gov
ernments of the United States of America and Calif
ornia in the territory of Ravenswood are null and
void for all time, and all bonds of servitude and fealty
Letween citizens thereof and these governments are
hereby dissolved."
Asked why the change had been made, Lord
Chancellor Edgar Daniels replied that the residents
of Ravenswood wished to free themselves from the
•luties of draft and taxation imposed by the Ameri
can governments.

The form of the new state is feudal absolutism. In
a second resolution the members conferred knight
hood upon themselves. They agreed that with this
title would go, in perpetuity, the right to be consti
tuted as a body of Electors in the choice of the Lord
of the Barony and his counsellors.
The resolution ended with the words:
. . and we further decree that all persons not
resident in the Barony of Ravenswood are to be
titled 'peasant' and shall hold that name and title
from this day forward." These resolutions of seces
sion were then communicated to the President of
the United States and the Governor of California.
The Lord Chancellor added that "the Knights of
Ravenswood defy the Americans to try to retake the
area. We will fight to the last man to defend our
liberty'."
