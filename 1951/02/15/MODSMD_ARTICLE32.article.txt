# Red Cross Needs Money to Collect Blood, Carry Out Other Services
## Money Donations Hardest to Collect 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
The American Red Cross is finding
it easier to extract blood from the
public than to get the people to do
nate their hard-earned money.
Such is the case on the Farm
wherf the Red Cross had no diffi
culty collecting a full quota of blood
but where the organization is hav
ing no success in reaching a $4,000
campus goal.
To date about $1,000 lias been
taken in here and the drive ends
tomorrow.
A reason for this phenomenon, the
public's reluctance to part with the
green stuff, has been advanced by the
Red Cross itself.
The organization says its services
are not proximate enough to many
people to make them aware of the
need of such services.'
A short check of services reveals
that the Red Cross faces the greatest
task of its career.
Some of the functions the govern
ment has turned over to the Red
Cross are:
1. Collect 00.000 pints of blood a
month.
2. Train 20 million civilians in first
aid.
Give home nursing instruction
fo 700,000 people.
" 4. Train 100.000 nurses' aides.
5. Offer food and nutrition service
in co-operation with other commu
nity groups.
This is only a partial list of Red
Cross services conducted at the re
quest of the federal government. As
the armed forces expand, these serv
i<' s will also expand.
The Red Cross offers many other
services which will continue during
the emergency. These services range
from visiting veterans' hospitals to
providing relief in disaster areas.
The Red Cross is the first group
to enter flood, earthquake, fire, and
ether disaster/ areas, and in the
present emergency the Red Cross
must expand its membership and
(ruining program to handle civil
ian and service needs.
Stanford's share of the nation's $&;i
million goal is $4,000. Come fire or
high water, the Rpd Cross has got to
have the money. Voluntary contri
bution is the easy way, and if it is
to work on the campus, the money
has to come in much faster.
II the contribution method fails,
the Red Cross will have to plan
omething elsje. The "something
else" is a question for the future,
which the Red Cross hopes won't
have to be answered.
Students wishing to contribute to
the drive may do so today at a booth
at Outer Quad, in front of the Law
.mil Business schools.

to work on the campus, the money
has to come in much faster.

MONEY FOR BLOOD—Blood donations given on campus en
abled soldiers like this in Korea to live. But only through money
donations to the Red Cross will this blood be able to get where
it will do some good.
The American Red Cross is finding
it easier to extract blood from the
public than to get the people to do
nate their hard-earned money.
Such is the case on the Farm
wherf the Red Cross had no diffi
culty collecting a full quota of blood
but where the organization is hav
ing no success in reaching a $4,000
campus goal.
To date about $1,000 lias been
taken in here and the drive ends
tomorrow.
A reason for this phenomenon, the
public's reluctance to part with the
green stuff, has been advanced by the
Red Cross itself.
The organization says its services
are not proximate enough to many
people to make them aware of the
need of such services.'
A short check of services reveals
that the Red Cross faces the greatest
task of its career.
Some of the functions the govern
ment has turned over to the Red
Cross are:
1. Collect 00.000 pints of blood a
month.
2. Train 20 million civilians in first
aid.
Give home nursing instruction
fo 700,000 people.
" 4. Train 100.000 nurses' aides.
5. Offer food and nutrition service
in co-operation with other commu
nity groups.
This is only a partial list of Red
Cross services conducted at the re
quest of the federal government. As
the armed forces expand, these serv
i<' s will also expand.
The Red Cross offers many other
services which will continue during
the emergency. These services range
from visiting veterans' hospitals to
providing relief in disaster areas.
