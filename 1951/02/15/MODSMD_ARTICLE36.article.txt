# Oldest Employee Honored At Special Luncheon Here
## 
### 
Having trouble with those ac
[ counting assignments? Physics lab
getting you down? Maybe you've
bogged down on your mechanical
engineering computations lately?
If you can afford the time, you
might purchase an adding machine;
but if you're in a hurry, better ask
Miss Layes how she does it.
It was 50 years ago last August
when Miss Frances R. Layes began
to work for the Stanford Bookstore
and at the age of 81 she is still going
strong; so strong in fact that even
IBM can't keep up with her. Miss
Layes, who is treasurer of the Book
j store, can still out - add an adding
machine!
"But only on the short sums," she
sighs. "That's just a matter of con
centration and practice. On the long
columns, the machines will catch up
with you and pass you."
Nevertheless, Miss Layes still as
tonishes her fellow employees with
the speed at which she races up a

column of figures, arriving at the
sum virtually on sight.
Miss Layes holds the distinction
of being the oldest employee on the
Stanford campus both in terms of
age and m years of service to the
University. It is in her honor that
a group of 45 people gathered at a
luncheon at the Union Tuesday.
Included among the guests were
present and past members, employ
ees, and directors of the Bookstore.
The affair was arranged by Dean J.
Hugh Jackson of the Graduate
School of Business, who is president
of the store's board of trustees.
During the course of the celebra
tion in her honor, Miss Layes was
presented with a book autographed
by all her guests and friends at the
luncheon. She was also given a
check in recognition of her 50 years
of service with the Stanford Book
store.
Miss Layes recalls that the
Bookstore lias grown considerably
j since she joined the staff in 1900.

: That year the staff of three han
dled $40,000 worth of business in
| three rooms of what is now the
Stanford Press liuilding.
Last year a staff of 20 did almost
$700,000 worth of business in (he
J present building. The building itself
I calls to mind the earthquake of 1906
to Miss Layes, because it was opened
just three weeks before that catas
trophe.
Classes were suspended and the
store closed, says Miss Layes, and it
took $4,000 to repair the cracks and
holes in the Bookstore, which at the
time had not been steel-reinforced.
"I was at home in bed that morn
ing at 5 o'clock," she recalls.
"First the room rocked back and
forth and then it whirled around.
And just as I got to the hall, our
table pitcher and basin crashed down
and doused me.
"We cooked outdoors for a month
I because our fireplace had been dam
aged and from time to time we would
! hear bricks falling down inside."

During the course of the celebra
tion in her honor, Miss Layes was
presented with a book autographed
by all her guests and friends at the
luncheon. She was also given a
check in recognition of her 50 years
of service with the Stanford Book
store.
Miss Layes recalls that the
Bookstore lias grown considerably
j since she joined the staff in 1900.

: That year the staff of three han
dled $40,000 worth of business in
| three rooms of what is now the
Stanford Press liuilding.
Last year a staff of 20 did almost
$700,000 worth of business in (he
J present building. The building itself
I calls to mind the earthquake of 1906
to Miss Layes, because it was opened
just three weeks before that catas
trophe.
Classes were suspended and the
store closed, says Miss Layes, and it
took $4,000 to repair the cracks and
holes in the Bookstore, which at the
time had not been steel-reinforced.
"I was at home in bed that morn
ing at 5 o'clock," she recalls.
"First the room rocked back and
forth and then it whirled around.
And just as I got to the hall, our
table pitcher and basin crashed down
and doused me.
"We cooked outdoors for a month
I because our fireplace had been dam
aged and from time to time we would
! hear bricks falling down inside."

Mrs. Helena Bauchou, left, manager of the store and long-time friend of M-iss Laycs, was among
the officials and friends present to honor Miss Layes at a luncheon held Tuesday at the Stanford
Union.
Having trouble with those ac
[ counting assignments? Physics lab
getting you down? Maybe you've
bogged down on your mechanical
engineering computations lately?
If you can afford the time, you
might purchase an adding machine;
but if you're in a hurry, better ask
Miss Layes how she does it.
It was 50 years ago last August
when Miss Frances R. Layes began
to work for the Stanford Bookstore
and at the age of 81 she is still going
strong; so strong in fact that even
IBM can't keep up with her. Miss
Layes, who is treasurer of the Book
j store, can still out - add an adding
machine!
"But only on the short sums," she
sighs. "That's just a matter of con
centration and practice. On the long
columns, the machines will catch up
with you and pass you."
Nevertheless, Miss Layes still as
tonishes her fellow employees with
the speed at which she races up a

column of figures, arriving at the
sum virtually on sight.
Miss Layes holds the distinction
of being the oldest employee on the
Stanford campus both in terms of
age and m years of service to the
University. It is in her honor that
a group of 45 people gathered at a
luncheon at the Union Tuesday.
Included among the guests were
present and past members, employ
ees, and directors of the Bookstore.
The affair was arranged by Dean J.
Hugh Jackson of the Graduate
School of Business, who is president
of the store's board of trustees.
