## Midweek Musings PCC HEADS TO MEET AGAIN 
### 
N<-xt Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, as the climax to nearly two
months of rumors, counter-rumors, and hedged statements, an important
,i', roup of meetings will take place at the Clift Hotel in San Francisco. Those
are the date set for the annual session of the presidents, athletic directors,
and faculty members of the Coast Conference schools, during which the
thn i groups will gather separately and in joint meetings to decide, among
other thiiii the oflicial PCC stand on the much-debated Rose Bowl situa
tion.
Although the same groups convened in Riverside early last month, that
session was devoted exclusively to discussion purposes. Next week's con
clave. on the other hand, is expected to produce some definite action on the
Pasadena problem.
The whole post-season quandary has been drawn to the fore, of course,
by the expiration ol the live-year Bowl pact with the Big Ten. That agree
ment reached it- inglorious, for the PCC, climax on New Year's Day when
Calilornia dropped it third consecutive Pasadena contest, this time to
underdog, Michigan, hv 1-1 to (J.

The end of the agreement was the 1
signal for every idea mail on tlie j
Coast to come foith wiih his purlieu- ;
lar proposal as t(> what should l>e
done about the post-season classic.
A number of plans were discussed
by the delegates at the Riverside
meeting, and i! is a good bet that one
of the alternatives which emanated
from the Southland confab will he j
adopted officially in San Francisco
next week.
Time to Review
Thus, the time appears ripe for a
review of the alternatives, with the !
attendant problems that will have to |
be solved at the Clilt. The following
is a list of the suggestions that were j
proclaimed most often and with most
emphasis at Riverside:
1. Discontinue post-season games
altogether, at least as a function of
the PCC. This one is unlikely to be
adopted, in view of the financial
benefits the after-hours affairs pro
vide to member schools.
2. Operate the Rose Howl as an all
star game between the top players of
the I'd and I>i« Ten. The primary
drawback is that such a contest
would detract from the annual char
ity-benefiting East-West Shriners'
a truly worthwhile affair.
Move (lie Bowl game to a date
two weeks following the close of the
regular season. Such an action would
remove many of the complaints sur
rounding New Year's games played
more than a month after the close of
the season, but would destroy the
holiday atmosphere, hence a good
portion of the gate, currently asso- j
eiated with the Rose Bowl.
4. Renew the present pact with the
Rig Ten. Lined up against the idea
are those who point to the five I
straight defeats of the Coast repre- |
ventatives as damaging to PCC pres- j
tige; and they re backed up by others
who aren't happy with the conflicting
rules of the two conferences, which
permit the same Coast team to com
pete year after year while barring
a Midwestern school from more than
one appearance every three years. |
•>• Renew the Rig Ten agreement,
hut with ami ndnicnts which would
put the two leagues on equal footing.
This one has a host of sub-alterna
tives, some of which are (a) require
the Dig Ten to withdraw their re
stiii lions on number of appearances,
(b) apply the one-in-three rule to
the PCC, or (e) adopt some compro
mise such as a uniform one-year-in- !
two ruling.
The last two proposals would, of
course, require the sanction of the |
L?i:j Ten, and the state of mind of j
that conference is not too clearly de
fined at present.
Anyway, that's the lineup—an out
sized challenge for the Conference
(Commissars.
