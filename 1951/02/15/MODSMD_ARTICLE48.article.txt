## Card Cagers Fly South For Second Try at UCLA 
### 
Everett Deans' cagers ran through a snappy workout last night
in preparation for their out-of-the-cellar drive against UCLA at
Los Angeles this weekend.
The Cards specialized on basket shooting against opposition,
individual work on how to guard certain UCLA players, and the

techniques of delayed offense and
stalling.
The Indians, who according to
Dean, "have been running very hard
in practice this week," will taper off
in their final workout this evening.
They will leave via Western Air-

lines for the never-never land of
Westwood at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow to
face the Bruins, who are famous for
giving good performances before the
home crowd. They've lost only one
game in the Westwood matchbox in
the last three years.
Johnny Wooden's Bruins will field
a starting lineup of Jerry Norman
and Dick Ridgeway at forwards,
Grover Luchsinger at center, and
Eddie Sheldrake and Don Johnson at
guards.
