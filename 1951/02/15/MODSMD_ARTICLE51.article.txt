### 
Ken Kelly of the Sigma Chill's
I dumped in 14 points to lead his team
to a 34 to 18 triumph over the SAE
ll's in a top mural basketball game
Tuesday night.
With Denny TufTanelli and Kelly
working smoothly to set each other
1 up for countless easy shots, the Sig.s
ran to a 19 to 12 half-time lead, wid
| ened the gap in the early part of the
second half, and coasted in to the
| finish.
Aside from two long shots by Jack
Knosher, all of the Sigma Chi scor
ing was on short set shots and lay
| ins, as six - foot - four Clyde Taylor
j controlled the backboards for them.
The SAE's were led in defeat by

Dick Broome's 14 markers, and the
sterling floor play of Gene Katnick
and Jack Butler.


HARD, BUT APPARENTLY CLEAN PLAY — As Bill Choate of Phi Kap I drove in for a layup last
night again Theta Chi I, he was stopped literally cold by Fred Chez, but no foul was called.
The Phi Kaps went on to win, 37 to 25, their fourth straight victory. —Daily photo
