# San Jose State Is Weak; Swimmers to Race Time
## 
### 
Toin Haynie's varsity swimmers
go against San Jose State tonight, in
what should be their easiest dual
meet of the season, at 7:1)0 in the
Spartan Gym.
High points of the meet will be the
relays. Haynie, looking toward the
NCAA championships, will concen
trate his best men in these events to
| see just what they can do.
Right now, the four-man freestyle
relay team of Bruce JPutnam, Bob
1 Thompson, Beit Holiday, and Bob
Frojen is about the fourth best in
| the country.
Best times at present are Putnam,
l 52.8; Thompson, 53.1; and Frojen
and Holiday, about 511.5. With an -
1 lay start, the times are about five
j tenths better per man.
If they each get their times down
I to about 52.0 for the 100, Haynie
thinks they have a good chance for
! second, behind Yale's record-break
-1 ing foursome.
In the medley relay, Frojen, Put
nam, and Thompson' will double up.
Frojen, PCC 100 - yard breast-stroke
champ, has done 1:01 8 already this
year, while Putnam has done 1:02 !)
j for the backstroke. Ohio State,
Michigan, Purdue, Yale, and Miehi-
J gan State, plus the Indians, will
| probably be in the NCAA finals in
this race.

Pete Cole, Stanford's ranking dis
tance freestyler, will be shooting for
the Spartan pool record of 4:41> in the
440 tonight. San Jose is weak in tins
event like all the others, and tin*
Cards' second man, John Mowat,
will have just finished his pre.;—in
duction physical, so Cole won't have
anyone to pace him.
The record is held by Ralph Sala,
who graduated from Stanford la; t
year. Sala, now a seaman recruit at
San Diego, has been sele< t_'d foi the
Pan America!! Game: men's team.
