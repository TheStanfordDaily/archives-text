# Stanford Directs Huge Polio Research Program
## 
### 
Stanford University has directed
over half a million dollars' worth of
research and education in the field
of infantile paralysis in the past 10
years, a study showed this week.
As the current March of Dimes
campaign closes today, the Univer
sity issued an accounting of how it
has applied $518,418 in March of
Dimes funds since 1940.
Work at present is proceeding on
the latest grant, made seven weeks
ago, of $41,48!) to chart the spread of
damage produced in the body by the
polio virus.
This grant is to be directed by Dr.
John A. Anderson, professor of pe
diatrics, and Dr. Harold K. Faber,
professor emeritus of pediatrics.
Added to $173,984 granted to Dr. Fa
ber since 1940, it brought to $215,473
the amount spent at Stanford for
work on this project.
During the past five years, $147,000
has been devoted to the Stanford Di
vision of Physical Therapy. An epi
demic aid unit which sped to a polio

outbreak in Texas in 1049 has re
ceived $20,875 over the past three
years. Its job is to train workers in
the field on the rudiments of treating
patients during a crisis.
Stanford scientists under their lat
est grant are seeking to trace the
route of the polio virus through the
central nervous system where it does
most damage.
Detailed knowledge of how the vi
rus travels through and leaves the
body, and the damage it does en
route, may provide scientists with
clues leading to defenses against the
infection and possibly against the
paralytic disease resulting.
One result of the researches al
ready has been the gathering of evi
dence by Dr. Faber and Dr. Ander
son indicating that the polio virus
generally enters the body from mu
cous membrane surfaces by way of
sensory nerves.
Dr. Faber has written in one med
ical journal that he believes the
mouth and throat are the likeliest
points of entry.
