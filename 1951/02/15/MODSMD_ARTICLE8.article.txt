# Roble Gets the Bird
## 
### 
A bird came to dine at Roble last
night — but there were no Valcn-
tines left for him.
His feathers preened and his

claws sharpened,
he flew into the
dining room a few
minutes late. And
the least he ex
pected was a place
to sit down and
eat.
Instead, his en
trance brought

cries of fear and hysteria as girls
crawled under the tables to avoid
him. Coffee and strawberry ice
cream garnished the floor as 12
freshmen shoved the hashers in
their haste to leave the dining

room.
The hashers, who were celebrat
ing in red crepe paper bow tics and
large red hearts, stood against the

walls and watched
as the bird circled
the room for 15
minutes.
Then, justifiably
angry over his
rude welcome, be
flew out and back
to his home in one
corner of the lob

oy-
As the girls left, one hasher was
heard to mutter, "If they get this
excited over a bird, what will
happen with an atomic bomb?"
