# Excom Tables Relations Post
## Proposal Sent To Committee 
### 
Excom last night considered a pro
posal submitted by Cardinals presi
dent Ted Hinshaw calling for the
ASSU president to appoint a perma
nent Student Public Relations Direc
tor and provide for the necessary
funds.
After some discussion, Excom
agreed to the appointment of a com- i
mittee to look into the details of the
proposal before any definite action is
taken.
Among other things, the commit
tee was asked to discover if any
other school had a similar official
and also if the University would
assume any share of the costs.
The proposed Student Public Res
lations Director would co-ordinate |
student public relations within and j
without the campus, maintain liaison
between the various media of com
munication and the various student
activities, promote student activities
both to the campus and to the out
side world, and assume other spe
cial duties.
Hinshaw, in making the proposal,
emphasized that the function of the
director would be to help in pro
motion and publicity from an ad
visory position, and that he would
not take over the actual publicity
work.
Rowland Rebcle, editor of The :
Daily, and Ted Buttner, ASSU presi
dent, cited the need for some means
of securing better promotion and
publicity for student activities. Butt
ner called attention to the recent
Louis Armstrong dance, which lost
more money than was expected, as a
possible example of inadequate pro
motion.
Rebele said if a public relations di
rector could be secured who knows
what newspapers want and also what
news angles his organizations pos
sess, a better paper could be put out
and better promotion could be se
cured.
Hinshaw estimated that the capi
tal expenses of providing adequate
facilities for the student director
would total about $263. In addi
tion to these costs, a yearly budget
would approximate $578.
The committee appointed by Butt
ner includes Bill Bothke, Men's Row
representative, Carol Penney, Wom
en's Row, and Ted Hnriton, Village.
These three will work with those
who drew up the proposal, Hinshaw
and former Daily editor Gordon Ad
| dison.
If Excom accepts the proposal,
the director will be chosen after
being interviewed by various of
ficers. The new agency would
probably require some changes in
the ASSU Constitution.
In other action last night, Excom
voted unanimously to continue the
present system of requiring the stu
dent representatives to the Stanford
Athletic Board to be appointed by the
ASSU president. Last week the
question arose of having the dele
gates elected instead.
The vote followed questioning of
i Tom Shaw and Jesse Cone, who with
Buttner are the student SAB repre
sentatives, as to the workings of the
SAB and the qualifications necessary
for the positions.
