chores, Fchring and Ruetz will tutor
the linemen, while Ghilotti will re

mentor. No head backfield or line
coaches will be appointed, all five as
sistants holding equal rank in Tay
lor's organizational scheme.
"I feel that this is a splendidly
balanced staff," Taylor said yester
day."I consider each of these men
to be a top-flight coach and am de
lighted to have such a fine group.
Now we'll roll up our sleeves and
really go to work."
Taylor also said yesterday that
Mai Elward, end coach under
Schwartz, would be retained as head
scout and jayvee coach.
Lynn, the only appointee not well
known to local devotees of the game,
