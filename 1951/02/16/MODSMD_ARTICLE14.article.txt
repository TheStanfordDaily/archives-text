At Wednesday's Excom meeting,
the members voted unanimously to
appropriate $14 from the ASSU Con
tingency Fund to help Stanford's
seven foreign scholarship students
purchase 1951 Quads.
Phil Nielsen, chairman of the for
eign scholarships committee, said
that the Quads would make perma
nent records of Stanford life that the
students could take back to their na
tive countries.
ASSU President Ted Buttncr,
speaking for the Union Board of
Governors, suggested that The Daily
urge students to clean up the area in
front of the Union.
Other Excom members also sug
gested that appropriate signs be
placed about the Cellar and that
trash cans be conspicuously painted
to attract attention.
Also, the Student-Faculty Educa
tion Commission was appropriated
$50 for various paper costs during
the rest of the school year. Excmo
thanked John Trainer, chairman of
the Survey Committee, for his work
on the ASSU Forum poll taken yes
terday.
