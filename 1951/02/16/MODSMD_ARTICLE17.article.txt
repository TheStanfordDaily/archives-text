# Card Cagers Head South To Battle Tough Bruins
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's men of bounce will try to out-fastbreak the UCLA
Bruins as the Los Angeles races get under way at 8 tonight. Both
tonight's and tomorrows' games will be broadcast.
The Westwood Pavilion, even smaller than Stanford's matchbox,
v/ill be the site of what is expected to be one of the liveliest and

fastest double-headers in PCC com
petition. When the two teams split
a pair of games here several weeks
ago, many old-timers swore that it.
was the fastest basketball competi
tion they had ever viewed.
Both squads work ofT the fast
break, and the games will probably
take on the proportions of a tennis
match, what with spectators rubber
ing their heads from side to side..
To win, however, Stanford will
have to do better than last week's
shabby performance. Observers
who saw the twin killing by the
Trojans gave several reasons for
Stanford's downfall. They sav the
USC "long bench" was a primary
factor. Southern Cal has ten subs
whom it can interchange with the
regulars and lose little.
Another reason was USC's obvi
out. dirtiness and the inefficiency of
the refs. The Trojans had 34 fouls
called against them and deserved to
have more, report the observers.
Every time a Stanford player

would try to gel. into Scoring posi
tion, he would be roughed up. Evi
dence of this is the fact, that Stanford
took more foul shots than they did
shots from the floor in the second
half of Saturday night's game. A
basketball rarity.
The Indians led Southern Cal, 35
to 30, at Friday's half-ti me intermis
sion and were better than the score
indicated, but four straight baskets
by Don Eby broke the Cardinals'
back.
UCLA, however, plays an en
tirely different style of basketball
than its cross - citv rivals. The
Bruins arc more potent offensive
ly, but they can be scored against.
They have the leading conference
scorer in soph Dick Ridgeway and
the league's best shooting percent
age of .349, as compared with Stan
ford's .323 average.
Four of Stanford's regulars rate
among the 12 high scorers in the
league. Forward Eddie Tucker is
second with a 16.3 average per game,
Jim Ramstead fourth with 13.2, Jim
Walsh seventh with 11.2, and Jack
O'Sullivan twelfth with 8.0.
Guard Bruce Ivcrsen, although
not a consistent point-getter, has
sparkled with his smooth floor
play and his setting-up shots for
other players.
Making the trip south will be the
starting fiVe plus Paul Johnson, Gary
Andrews, George Zaninovich, Fritz
Fenster, Bill Stevenson, Dan Evans,
Sid Hasler, Coaches Everett Dean
and Bob Burnett, trainer Connie Jar
vis, managers Ray Willion, Dan
Mishell, and this reporter.

Stanford's men of bounce will try to out-fastbreak the UCLA

tonight's and tomorrows' games will be broadcast.

was the fastest basketball competi
tion they had ever viewed.
Both squads work ofT the fast
break, and the games will probably
take on the proportions of a tennis
match, what with spectators rubber
ing their heads from side to side..
To win, however, Stanford will
have to do better than last week's
shabby performance. Observers
who saw the twin killing by the
Trojans gave several reasons for
Stanford's downfall. They sav the
USC "long bench" was a primary
factor. Southern Cal has ten subs
whom it can interchange with the
regulars and lose little.
Another reason was USC's obvi
out. dirtiness and the inefficiency of
the refs. The Trojans had 34 fouls
called against them and deserved to
have more, report the observers.
Every time a Stanford player

would try to gel. into Scoring posi
tion, he would be roughed up. Evi
dence of this is the fact, that Stanford
took more foul shots than they did
shots from the floor in the second
half of Saturday night's game. A
basketball rarity.
The Indians led Southern Cal, 35
to 30, at Friday's half-ti me intermis
sion and were better than the score
indicated, but four straight baskets
by Don Eby broke the Cardinals'
back.
UCLA, however, plays an en
tirely different style of basketball
than its cross - citv rivals. The
Bruins arc more potent offensive
ly, but they can be scored against.
They have the leading conference
scorer in soph Dick Ridgeway and
the league's best shooting percent
age of .349, as compared with Stan
ford's .323 average.
Four of Stanford's regulars rate
among the 12 high scorers in the
league. Forward Eddie Tucker is
second with a 16.3 average per game,
Jim Ramstead fourth with 13.2, Jim
Walsh seventh with 11.2, and Jack
O'Sullivan twelfth with 8.0.
Guard Bruce Ivcrsen, although
not a consistent point-getter, has
sparkled with his smooth floor
play and his setting-up shots for
other players.
