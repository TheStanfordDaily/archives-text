# It's Time for Some Common Sense
## 
### 
There are 4,500 registered automobiles at
Stanford.
There are approximately 3,000 parking
spaces—all of which are never full at any one
time, according to Police Chief Gordy Davis.
What's the problem? Why do students get
parking tickets "all of a sudden" after they've
been parking in the same places for weeks at a
time? Why are there "never enough spaces?"
Believe it or not, there are answers to those
questions and the hundreds like them.
Only part of the answer lies in the distressing
fact that many of us are just too lazy to walk to
Quad and insist on using cars to snarl traffic
and aggravate the parking situation.
Many of the parking gripes are directly at
tributable to those who do insist on using their
cars—but who fail to observe common sense
procedures. We submit the following:
1. Senseless parking methods. Day in and
day out, campus cops observe groups of eight
and 10 cars taking up space enough for twice
as many vehicles.
2. Illegal parking that's altogether unneces
sary. Although there are plenty of spaces ac
tually available within a two-block radius of
Quad, all of them aren't necessarily exactly
adjacent to classes.
Campus drivers leave late for class, then try
to find a space as close as possible to that class.
This doesn't work, so students find themselves
parking in illegal zones, and "taking a chance"
that everything will be O.K. Because of a
shortage of police wardens, a student may not
get ticketed for months at a time.
3. An unrealistic approach. The time wasted
U-turning back and forth in front of Quad can
be time saved by heading immediately for the
Women's Gym lot (which is never full), or the
Stern lot, which is often part empty. You'll get
to class sooner that way—and preserve the
pocket money, too.
To clarify the problem, Excom is pub
lishing a three-page mimeographed pamphlet
outlining campus parking areas and regula
tions. Included will be a full-page map of the
campus showing present parking areas plus
ihose that are proposed. The proposed lots
will be constructed once the long range "circu
lar road plan" gets beyond the blueprint stage
—all of which may take another 20 years.
The only way to solve the problem now—
without waiting 20 years, or charging each car
registrant two or three dollars a year for resur

faced lots, white lines, and other additions that
should be unnecessary at Stanford—is to get
on the ball and use some "common sense"
parking methods. It shouldn't be too much to
ask.

Speaking of common sense, it would appear
we've got another spanking coming.
This week nine of "our guys" were found
guilty of lighting firecrackers in a P.A. movie
house and blazing away at a few local cabs
with high-powered water pistols — or some
such similar weapons.
It seems inconsistent to blow off steam about
"Paly youth vandalism" if we insist on turning
around and doing tit for tat.
Regardless of what the facts may be con
cerning the two cases, we feel that two wrongs
have never made a right.
As a matter of fact, the second wrong usually
serves only to incense the opposition and make
things worse for our own reputation—as well
as that of this University.

A Word of Welcome . . .
Tomorrow, Stanford will play host to some
300 students from 40 Bay Area prep schools
as "High School Day" gets under way.
The high schoolers will take tours, eat
lunches in campus living groups, listen to talks
by ASSU president Ted Buttner, the Men's and
Women's Counselors, and Dr. Rixford Snyder
of the Admissions Office. They'll also see one
of our own One-Act productions.
"High School Day" is one of the few student
sponsored events designed to acquaint future
Stanfordites with the Farm and its varied ways
of life. It's a good idea, one that's meant a lot
of hard work, and one that deserves our sup
port.
To insure the program of even greater suc
cess, we'd suggest you recall one of our own
traditions that has somehow gone out of vogue
in recent years.
A friendly "hello" when you eye a mass of
bewildered expressions will go a long way
toward making our visitors "feel at home." We
think it will also serve to give them a better
picture of the genuine spirit of friendliness that
surrounds the campus.
To start the ball rolling, The Daily would like
to say HELLO and WELCOME to all the HIGH
SCHOOLERS.
