### 
(Editor's Note: This is the first in
;i series on Summer. 1951, Abroad.)
By JOAN SEAVER
Wanderlust has infected the
student body just about three
months later than ordinarily,
this year. But the local travel
agencies agree that it has made
up for lost time in the last three
weeks, bringing with it a tidal
wave of student inquiries about
summer trips abroad.
Tourist class on the major trans
atlantic ships is completely booked
as it is every year at this time. Or
ganized tours, which still have open
ings. offer students almost their only
chance at inexpensive ocean travel.
War jitters and the draft have dis
couraged a few would-!*- traveler;,

bound for Europe and the Western
Hemisphere, but they have only de
layed the plans of most students. Re
lease of international tension plus the
willingness of all reputable lines and
agencies to refund deposits in case
of emergency have started travel
queries rolling again.
Tours Most Popular
The lIR Travel Bureau reports
that conducted tours head the list in
popularity. Varying in price from
$500 to $1800 for two or three months
of travel, the tours include any
where from two to 12 nations in their
itineraries.
A student can explore the Middle
East for $480. Eor less than twice
that price he can visit 11 European
countries from Scandinavia to Italy.
NSA. American Student Travel
A ' ociation, American Youth Abroad,
American Youth Hostels, Inc., Uni

versity Travel Co., and StTA organ
ize some of the more highly recom
mended tours with reason for the
average student income.
Study Tours Supported
The educational globe-trotting
combination is receiving healthy
support from American organiza
tions and from foreign universities.
Study tours difler little in cost or
coverage from the other tours, $750
to $1,000 for tuition plus expenses,
and emphasize some particular area
or subject such as language, art, or
regional history for the selective
tourist. A few universities in this
country offer academic credit to stu
dents entering these programs.
Complete information on possibili
ties for foreign travel and study are
available in the files of the lIR Travel
Bureau open every afternoon of the
week.


TRAVEL PLANS — Members of the Travel Study and Living Abroad Committee of the lIR are
supplying information for student travel in Europe and South America. Pictured from left to

summer trips abroad.

chance at inexpensive ocean travel.

couraged a few would-!*- traveler;,

agencies to refund deposits in case
of emergency have started travel
queries rolling again.
