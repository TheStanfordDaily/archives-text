# MOOT COURT PRELIMS
## Student Lawyers To Begin Trials 
### 
Forty-eight of Stanford's as- j
piring lawyers will go into ac
tion next v/eek as the prelimi
nary round of Moot Court com
petition gets underway Monday
night.
Participating in the competition,
which will last through Feb. 27, will
be second-year students of the Law
School. Three teams of four men
each will argue on one of four theo
retical legal cases. In each argument
of the problem, two students will
represent the plaintiff, and two will
present arguments for the defendant.
Judges Evaluate Lawyers
Three presiding judges will rule at
each session of the court and will
evaluate the participants on the basis I
of their individual briefs, the brief
as a whole, oral presentation, and
their answers to questions from the
Court.
A practicing attorney and two
third-year Law School students who
have previously participated in Moot
Court competition will act as appel
late court judges at the sessions of
the court.
The four problems which will be
tackled by the law students will be
argued as if before an appellate court
â€”that is, on points of law rather than
on the facts of the case itself.
Breach of Contract
The first case, to be argued Mon
day and Tuesday nights, concerns the
appeal of the manager of a noted
singer. The singer has entered into
a contract with him to manage her
bookings, thereby breaking a con
tract with her former manager. The
former manager successfully sues

the present manager in the lower
courts, and the case is now on ap
peal.
The three other cases involve re
spectively the problem of distributing
the liquidated damages of a corpor
ation, a problem concerning the con
tract of a mural painter whose par
tially-finished work is destroyed by
fire, and the case of a man who sends
a libelous or slanderous phonograph
record to an acquaintance.
