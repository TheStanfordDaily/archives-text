# Boxers Face Santa Clara
## 
### 
Stanford's winless boxing squad
will tackle Santa Clara for the sec
ond time tomorrow night at 8 in the
Pavilion.
The fighters face an uphill battle
in their quest for their first win in
four matches. They will have to for
feit one and possibly two bouts to
the Broncos.
John Colton, 155 - pounder, has
been out all week with a badly cut
lip, suffered in the Cal match, and
will not be able to fight tomorrow.
This leaves the Cards down one
point.
The heavy demand of the gymnas
tic team will probably prevent 135-
pound Bob White from fighting any
more this year. Down a probable
second point are the Cards.
In the remaining divisions Coach
Mitchell will start two of the trio—
Tom Griffiths, Bob Neighbor, and
Chuck Mac Clean—in the 125-pound
and 130-pound slots.
Bob Baker, who showed vast im
provement in defeating Ed Griffin of
Cal, will battle at his customary 145
pounds.
Bob Baldocchi, fully recovered
from his defeat last Saturday, will
open at IGS pounds; at 175 will be
Bob Myers; and in the heavyweight
division Dave Oberlin is back after
taking a week's rest to have some
cartilage removed from his nose.
