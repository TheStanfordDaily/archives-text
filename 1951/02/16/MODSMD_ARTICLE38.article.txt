# Stanford's Horsehiders to Meet Palo Alto Oaks; Face Several Former Indians
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
With one unofficial win to their
credit, the Stanford varsity nine will
go for an official one at 2?30 tomor
row afternoon when they lock bats
with the visiting Palo Alto Oaks.
The Oaks, who have forsaken
their usual Sabbath encounter for a
crack at the CIBA champs, are led
by a pair of former Stanford greats,
Dave Dahle and Monte Pfyl, and are
pretty much a "good pitch, no hit"
team.
Dahle, a lefty, is well known to
Stanford fans and is probably the
best port-sided pitcher in Cardi
nal history. lie is now under con
tract to the Oakland Oaks.
It was way back in the l*)4o's that
Pfyl, now better known for his Fire
house five plus two intramural foot
ball playing, was the rage of the
CIBA at shortstop. But he still has
the old come through, and it's been i
said that he never hits until some
one gets on base.
Bespectacled Monte is the playing
manager of the Oaks, whose roster
includes former Cards Doc Mason at
third and Charlie Cole in center, j
Shortstop is held down by Stanford
Frosh Coach Bill Alhouse, and in
left is the wonder boy of Palo Alto
High School, A 1 Talboy, who also
pitches when not giving everybody
in general a bad time.
Bob Morris, who caught for the

Stanford frosh two years ago, will
receive Dahle's slants, and Duane
Crawford, who played for the Ven
tura Yankees, will handle the initial
sack chores.
For the Indians, two sophomores
—Jack Shepard and Chuck Es
stv'.ian — and two seniors — Bruce
Cameron and Dick Clegg — have
been abusing the horsehide some
thing fierce as of late ami are ex
pected to lead the attack on Dahle.
Another feature in tomorrow's
game will be the unveiling of con
verted catcher Jim Castagnoli at
first base.
Roger Osenbaugh, the copper
thatched chucker out of Sacramento,
is expected to break off the first

wrinkle for the varsity and will be
followed immediately, if not sooner,
by Jim Claypool, Joe Chez, and Tony
Stellar.
