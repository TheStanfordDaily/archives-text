### ROY HEMMING GEORGE BUCKLEY 
The names of Marlene Dietrich and Maurice Chevalier have a
unique position in any list of the top personalities in the earliest
days of talking pictures; and this week two Bay Area theaters are
giving us a chance to see both of them up to their old tricks in
their native languages—one a merry "copy," the other a fascinat-

ing "original."
The Guild in Menlo is offering a

physically older
Chevalier spread
ing his old-time
musical comedy
in "A Royal Af
fair." Basically it's
just so much ro
mantic drivel,
about a dime
novel king who

spends his days and nights wooing a
whole assortment of Parisian
wenches while on a supposedly dip
lomatic mission.
But with Chevalier dominating
the proceedings, it becomes agree
ably spirited entertainment, with an
emphasis on bedroom farce and
Chevalier's delightful way with
French songs.
Dietrich Film
The Dietrich film is the famous
"Blue Angel" which the Larkin in
S.F. has revived. This is the film
that literally made Miss Dietrich—
but its interest should be more than
historical since it stands up excep
tionally well as a brilliant study of
moral degradation in Germany in the
prc-Hitler years.
Il is the story of a professor who
gets involved with a cabaret singer,
and shows the late Emil Jannings in
one of his finest characterizations, as
well as exhibiting Miss Dictrich as a
more frowsy frpu than American
audiences have lately seen her—al
though her famous legs and vocal
pipes seem to have a really endur
ing quality.
