# Econ Lecture Summarizes Mobilization
## 
### 
"The ultimate problem in mo
bilization is that of getting peo
ple to do more work while giv
ing them less in goods and
services."
This was Economics Professor Mel
vin Reder's summary of the wage
manpower dilemma. In the fourth in
a series of lectures on economic prob
lems of mobilization, given Wednes
day afternoon, he added that this
situation "Roes against our capitalis
tic culture" and foresaw no imme
diate or practicable solution.
"In fact," he concluded, "I am in
the position of the father who drew
the picture of a bogey-man for his
children, looked at it, and cried
•Help'!"
Stable Wages Difficulty
Reder emphasized the extreme
difficulty, if not impossibility, of
keeping wages down and keeping
men on the job to maintain maximum
production.
One of his suggestions was the use
of high average and low marginal tax
rates—so that additional and over
time pay would not be largely con
sumed by taxes, thus lowering the
incentives to work.
"Treason" Nonsense
"Talk about strikes being treason,
when our boys are fighting in Ko
rea, is nonsense," Reder said, in de
fending labor and labor unions from
charges that they are responsible for
the tremendous upward pressure on
wages.
Labor leaders are as responsible in
their conduct concerning the public
welfare—"in some ways less irre
sponsible" — as representatives of
other special interests in the econ
omy, he said.
Their role in mobilization, which
they performed well in World War 11,
was to "act as the policeman for so
ciety in keeping wages down." Pre
viously they were rewarded with top
policy posts in government. "This is
not done now, and we are going to
have a lot of trouble until it is done,"
Reder commented. —C.L.
