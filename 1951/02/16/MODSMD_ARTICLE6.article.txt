WASHINGTON - Defense Secre
tary George C. Marshall said today
the United States plans to send four
more divisions—about 100,000 ground
troops—to Europe and warned "we'd
be in very serious danger" of inva
sion if Russia overran the Continent.
Appealing to Congress not to im
pose "limitation" on troop shipments,
he said powerful naval - air units
alone could not stop Russia and cau
tioned that American forces may
have to stay in Europe for a decade.
