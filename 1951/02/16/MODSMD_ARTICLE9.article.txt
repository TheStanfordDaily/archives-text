# ‘Angel of the Lord' Proves Too Ambitious in One-Acts Program
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
The curtain went up on the Ram's Head One Acts last night in
the Little Theater and gave a capacity audience three plays that
were at times a? good as they were bad, at others as hackneyed
as they were original.
Curtain-raiser at the proceedings was "Any Number Will Do"

by Pay Barrett. This light comedy
about a lonely girl who gets a date by
dialing numbers at random, is en
tirely successful in its unpretentious
effort to entertain.
Mr. Barrett's neat construction and
diverting new twists on the girl- |
snags-boy theme are nicely abetted j
by John Brebncr's skillful direction
and a highly imaginative set. Jill j
Nisbet is perhaps a bit too sweet as
Peggy, the girl, but Margaret Mc-
Kenna. as her roommate, steals the J
show with her acid delivery.
Peter Emmet's "Angel of the
Lord," the story-in-vcrsc of an
"unsophisticated" boy who finds
himself in the callous wasteland of
a cocktail party, is the most ambi- I
tious of the plays. But the com
parison to T. S. Eliot, who also has
versified over the cocktail shaker,
is unavoidable, and it is as if Mr.
Emmet deliberately stacked the
hors d'oeuvres against himself.
Obviously he can write, but iambic |
pentameter has hampered greater j
men than he, and the limtations of
the verse form lead into a rather j
talky vehicle for his philosophy.
v The main trouble is a miscon- !
ception on Mr. Emmet's part as to
how to satirize affected college stu
dents (certainly ripe material for
such treatment).
It is hard t.o believe these fantastic
young sophisticate', actually leav
bed and bourbon to indulge in the j
banalities of the classroom.
Roger Morris, as the disenchanted '
young man, sing-songs the rhythms j
and stutters too much to hold in
to cM during his long, difficult
speeches. Earl Jones, as the host, is
the only really convincing worldling,
wilh the exception of Tom Fraser,
who, as a guest, is degenerately per
fect. Director Edward Linck might,
have improved matters by being less
obvious in leading his characters to
center front to speak their lines and
then sending them back again.
/\nd one must not be too harsh j
with Mr. Emmet, who at least at- j
tempted something unusual, which
is more than can be said for Keith
l isk. Mis "One Hundred Acres and |
a Man'' delighted the audience— |
and has been doing so for years. !
This farce contains almost all the
cliches associated with hillblilies

from the gun-totin' female (well
played by Virginia Hamilton) who i
gets her man by hitting over thei
head, to the little urchin with a
big name (in this case, not surpris
ingly, Robert E. Lee).
But an excellent set, highly accom
plished direction by Roy Benjamin,
and generally fine acting by the
whole cast manage to pep up an
otherwise pretty unoriginal play.

This farce contains almost all the
cliches associated with hillblilies

gets her man by hitting over thei
head, to the little urchin with a

But an excellent set, highly accom
plished direction by Roy Benjamin,
and generally fine acting by the
whole cast manage to pep up an
otherwise pretty unoriginal play.

Acts now being presented at the Little Theater. Pictured from left to right are Brebner, Curt
Hungerford, Jill Nisbet, and Margaret McKenna. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson

The curtain went up on the Ram's Head One Acts last night in
the Little Theater and gave a capacity audience three plays that
were at times a? good as they were bad, at others as hackneyed
as they were original.
Curtain-raiser at the proceedings was "Any Number Will Do"

by Pay Barrett. This light comedy
about a lonely girl who gets a date by
dialing numbers at random, is en
tirely successful in its unpretentious
effort to entertain.
Mr. Barrett's neat construction and
diverting new twists on the girl- |
snags-boy theme are nicely abetted j
by John Brebncr's skillful direction
and a highly imaginative set. Jill j
Nisbet is perhaps a bit too sweet as
Peggy, the girl, but Margaret Mc-
Kenna. as her roommate, steals the J
show with her acid delivery.
Peter Emmet's "Angel of the
Lord," the story-in-vcrsc of an
"unsophisticated" boy who finds
himself in the callous wasteland of
a cocktail party, is the most ambi- I
tious of the plays. But the com
parison to T. S. Eliot, who also has
versified over the cocktail shaker,
is unavoidable, and it is as if Mr.
Emmet deliberately stacked the
hors d'oeuvres against himself.
Obviously he can write, but iambic |
pentameter has hampered greater j
men than he, and the limtations of
the verse form lead into a rather j
talky vehicle for his philosophy.
v The main trouble is a miscon- !
ception on Mr. Emmet's part as to
how to satirize affected college stu
dents (certainly ripe material for
such treatment).
