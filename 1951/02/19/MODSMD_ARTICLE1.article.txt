## UN Troops Roll On As Reds Withdraw 
### 
TOKYO. Monday, Feb. 19 (LP)—
American and British troops lolled
northward as far as seven miles in
west central Korea Sunday on the
heels of withdrawing Chinese as the
enemy's week-old counter-offensive
collapsed over most of the front.
The Anglo - American units ad
vanced to the hills overlooking the
Han River and eliminated virtually
ail of the Communist pockets in the
area southeast of Seoul.
However, Chinese and North Ko
reans stabbed at the communications
hub of Chechon in the eastern sector
to the right of the United Natoins
central front. There the enemy
probed through storm-swept moun
tains trying to find an opening for a
last-gasp attack against that city—
an important gateway to southeast
Korea.
