## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 —Assist-
ant Defense Secretary Marx Leva
said today it would be 18 months to
two years before the Defense De
partment could draft 18-year-olds,
under the Universal Service bill ap
proved by the Senate Armed Serv
ices Committee.
The measure provides that no 18-
year-olds can be taken until all cli—
gibles in the present 19-through-25
age groups have been inducted. Be
sides, the bill specifics that Selective
Service must comb the ranks of
4-F's to see if any can be used for
"limited service."
