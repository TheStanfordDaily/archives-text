# CCNY Cage Men Named In Scandal
## 
### BOB SPIELMANN 
Nat Holman's CCNY "grand
slam" basketball team yester
day became involved in the sec
ond great scandal in New York
within a month. Probably no
other team in the history of
sports has fallen so far from so
high, so quickly.
Co-captains Ed Roman and Ed
Warner, and star guard A 1 Roth were
named by District Attorney Frank
Hogan as the playex-s who had taken
bribes to throw three games—to Mis
souri, Arizona, and Boston College.
Hogan said all three of the men ad
mitted their guilt.
The "Payoff Man"
Salvatore Tarto Solazo, a 45-year
old jeweler described as the "pay
off man," Edward Gard, captain of
last year's Long Island University
Blackbirds, and Harvey Schaff, a
New York University player, all ad
mitted to charges of either giving or
offering a bribe.
The three CCNY' players were
charged with each receiving $1,000
to throw the season's opener against
Missouri, a game that the Beaver's
lost, 54 to 37, in the year's first big
upset. They supposedly received a
similar amount for their part in los
ing to University of Arizona, 41 to 38.
The third game named in the "fix"
was the Jan. 11 encounter with Bos
ton College in which CCNY was
beaten, 63 to 59. For this Roth and
Roman were assertedly offered $1,500
apiece, but Warner only $500 be
cause he was sick and not expected
to play.
$250 for Extra Efforts
In addition, Hogan said, the players
each received $250 for their "extra
efforts" in the Washington State
game which CCNY won, 59 to *43,
and the game against St. John's
which they lost, 47 to 44.
Since pamblers operate on a "point
spread," that is, they bet that a team
will win or lose by so many points,
this probably means that in these
two games they were betting with
CCNY, and told Roth, Roman, and
Warner to inn the score as high as
possible.
District Attorney Hogan said that
a squad of 20 detectives had been
working 16 hours a day to develop
an anonymous tip into the arrests.
While from Washington comes word
that Senator Estes Kefauver's Crime
Investigating Committee has had ad
vance word of this new fix for some
time.

$250 for Extra Efforts
In addition, Hogan said, the players
each received $250 for their "extra
efforts" in the Washington State
game which CCNY won, 59 to *43,
and the game against St. John's
which they lost, 47 to 44.
Since pamblers operate on a "point
spread," that is, they bet that a team
will win or lose by so many points,
this probably means that in these
two games they were betting with
CCNY, and told Roth, Roman, and
Warner to inn the score as high as
possible.
District Attorney Hogan said that
a squad of 20 detectives had been
working 16 hours a day to develop
an anonymous tip into the arrests.
While from Washington comes word
that Senator Estes Kefauver's Crime
Investigating Committee has had ad
vance word of this new fix for some
time.
Nat Holman's CCNY "grand
slam" basketball team yester
day became involved in the sec
ond great scandal in New York
within a month. Probably no
other team in the history of
sports has fallen so far from so
high, so quickly.
Co-captains Ed Roman and Ed
Warner, and star guard A 1 Roth were
named by District Attorney Frank
Hogan as the playex-s who had taken
bribes to throw three games—to Mis
souri, Arizona, and Boston College.
Hogan said all three of the men ad
mitted their guilt.
The "Payoff Man"
Salvatore Tarto Solazo, a 45-year
old jeweler described as the "pay
off man," Edward Gard, captain of
last year's Long Island University
Blackbirds, and Harvey Schaff, a
New York University player, all ad
mitted to charges of either giving or
offering a bribe.
The three CCNY' players were
charged with each receiving $1,000
to throw the season's opener against
Missouri, a game that the Beaver's
lost, 54 to 37, in the year's first big
upset. They supposedly received a
similar amount for their part in los
ing to University of Arizona, 41 to 38.
The third game named in the "fix"
was the Jan. 11 encounter with Bos
ton College in which CCNY was
beaten, 63 to 59. For this Roth and
Roman were assertedly offered $1,500
apiece, but Warner only $500 be
cause he was sick and not expected
to play.
