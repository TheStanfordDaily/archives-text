# Bruins Topple Indians Twice
## Sheldrake Hits 38; Sets Mark 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's basketballers were
rudely muscled into the dark
confines of the conference cel
lar last weekend by UCLA as
the Los Angeles jinx prevailed
for the fourth time in eight days.
The Bruins, who know every sliv
er of their home court by heart and
who have lost only one game there
in three years, triumphed Friday, 56
to 48, and dittoed on Saturday by the
bloated score of 90 to 67.
Everett Dean's cagers weren't
shoved into the cellar without a
shout of protest, however. On both
days, they led for a good part of the
first half. The Westwooders' supe
rior reserve strength came to the
fore in the second stanzas, and their
fast break went into high gear.
The Cards jumped to an imme
diate advantage on Friday as Jim
Walsh got free for a lay-in and
added a free shot for a 3 to 3 score.
Eddie Tucker meshed a foul shot,
and Walsh followed with another
driving lay-in and a long set shot
to make it 8 to 3.
Coach John Wooden's boys then
whittled down the lead and went
ahead, although the Stanfords were
in hailing distance throughout the
first half.
Walsh was the individual star of
the game as he pocketed seven field
goals and five free shots for 19 points.
Besides being high point man, the
six-foot-three guard was a terror on
the backboards. Also sparkling for
the Farm boys was Tucker, who
gave a free shot exhibition by tank
ing 10 out of 11 attempts.
The Saturday affair was a dupli
cate of the Friday night tiff, only
in exaggerated proportions. The
first half was breathtakingly close,
and the Cards led 35 to 34 with
three minutes remaining until the
intermission.
It was then that Eddie Sheldrake,
the five-foot-nine-inch UCLA cap
tain, decided to set a new conference
scoring record. The blond Bruin
proceeded to sink 15 out of 23 floor
attempts and eight free shots for a
record-shattering 38 points. The old
mark was held by Ralph Vaughn of
USC—36 points set in 1939.
Jim Ramstead, Walsh, and Tucker
were sterling in defeat for Stanford.
Ramstead and Walsh swept the back
boards for the Indians and each
racked up 16 points. Tucker hit for
13 and Captain Jack O'Sullivan
meshed some sensational jump shots.
There was one consolation for the
Deanmen in defeat—they won't havo
to play in Los Angeles again this
year.
