# Honor Code Understanding
## 
### 
In the midst of a quarter marked to a certain
degree by war-caused uncertainties, one of the
most certain and solid of Stanford's traditions
comes up for a bit of airing this week.
Starting tonight, informative talks on the
Honor Code will be given at each living group
on campus. The purpose of these reorientation
talks will be to inform students about the mech
anism of the Honor Code program. No plead
ing, no scolding; just talks based on the
supposition that if Stanford students know
how the Honor Code program works and how
violations are handled, that they will better un
derstand its purpose.
This is an intelligent idea. The Honor Code
reorientation program is a mature approach to
a system which can be successful only in a
mature surrounding.
There has been some question as to how well
the Honor Code system would hold up under
the pressures created by draft-worried students
desperately reaching for high grades. A re
cent outbreak of violations in which five men
were convicted by the Student Council added
to this talk.
But Wayne Alley, Stanford Honor Code

chairman, doesn't see the Honor Code system
in any particular danger. "This is a quarter like
any other quarter as far as the Code is con
cerned," he said. "I don't believe there is a real
increase in violations which can be attributed
to the draft."
The reorientation program is not being
started because of any weakening of student
attitude toward the Honor Code. Alley said it
is designed to fill in the gap between the period
when the student, as a frosh, is told time and
again about the spirit of the Honor Code, and
the period soon reached when he thinks about
it automatically, but with little understanding,
while signing his blue book.
Actually, the program is more of a refresher
course than a reorientation. Few students un
derstand how the student-operated Honor Code
works.
Campus opinion now and always has sup
ported the Honor Code wholeheartedly as one
of the fine "Stanford extras." Few schools have
such a good program in operation. And so the
Honor Code Committee's concept of the reori
entation program might well be this: If the sys
tem is worth having, then it's worth under
standing. â€”G.M.
