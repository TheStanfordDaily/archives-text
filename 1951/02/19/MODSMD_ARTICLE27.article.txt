### VIC PALMIERI 
Why don't the waiters at L'Ommie's wise up?
For my dough, Andre has far and away the best
all around bistro in these parts, and the people he's
got working there in the bar are as nice a crowd as
you'd care to meet. But where did he dig up that gang

of hysterical Frenchmen who wait
on you—if you're lucky—in the
dining room?
Now I can't admit being a
habitue of the L'Omelette chow
line, unfortunately. But every
now and then I do manage to
blackmail my father into treating
me to Child's Plate there, and I
even worked as a bus boy in the

dining room for a week once, until Andre told me he'd
double my salary if I'd quit. So I do have some basis
for my beef.
In the first place, it's never particularly pleasant
to wait 15 or 20 minutes after sitting down at the
table for the waiter to come over and take the order.
Especially if you can't afford another cocktail, and
you can't eat any more French bread. But if the
waiter is obviously too busy, well then you wait,
that's all.
But these birds have a habit of letting you sit and
make hungry conversation while they flutter around,
fawning on a few people whom they have obviously
j»ot staked out as big spenders, some of whom may
have sat down long after you have.
Well, maybe they have to do that to earn a living.
Or maybe they know my name and figure they'll get

a raise if they ignore me. But like I say, how much
French bread can you eat?
When I really start to blow my top, however, is when
one of these frantic Franks finally does come over to
worry you with a few seconds of his time. Now, nerv
ous people aren't pleasant to deal with anytime, as
far as I'm concerned, but at the dinner table especially,
it's nice to have someone who doesn't look like he
might fall down and start chewing the rug at any
moment.
But wait till one of these red-faced characters
swoops down on you, chattering in his carefully nur
tured French accent, and waving the menu in front
of your nose like a checkered flag. The last time one
of them came over to my table I thought the building
was on fire.
It wouldn't matter quite so much, however, if
they'd just give you a chance to order. I realize this
business of telling the waiter precisely what you
would like to have is strictly a provincialism, dis
tinctly out of place in the Continental atmosphere
of the Peninsula's French Restaurant . . . hut at
four bucks a throw, I figure I'm entitled to stand on
my head and whistle Dixie (also a quaint provin
cialism) if I feel like it.
But the way these babies launch into their spiel,
write down half the menu and take off before you've
said "Cocquilles St. Jacque Robinson," you'd think
their mothers were scared by F. E. Boone.
This stuff has got to go. How about it, Andre? Or
is the Egg getting a little chicken? If you know what
I mean.

me to Child's Plate there, and I
even worked as a bus boy in the

dining room for a week once, until Andre told me he'd
double my salary if I'd quit. So I do have some basis
for my beef.
In the first place, it's never particularly pleasant
to wait 15 or 20 minutes after sitting down at the
table for the waiter to come over and take the order.
Especially if you can't afford another cocktail, and
you can't eat any more French bread. But if the
waiter is obviously too busy, well then you wait,
that's all.
But these birds have a habit of letting you sit and
make hungry conversation while they flutter around,
fawning on a few people whom they have obviously
j»ot staked out as big spenders, some of whom may
have sat down long after you have.
Well, maybe they have to do that to earn a living.
Or maybe they know my name and figure they'll get

a raise if they ignore me. But like I say, how much
French bread can you eat?
When I really start to blow my top, however, is when
one of these frantic Franks finally does come over to
worry you with a few seconds of his time. Now, nerv
ous people aren't pleasant to deal with anytime, as
far as I'm concerned, but at the dinner table especially,
it's nice to have someone who doesn't look like he
might fall down and start chewing the rug at any
moment.
But wait till one of these red-faced characters
swoops down on you, chattering in his carefully nur
tured French accent, and waving the menu in front
of your nose like a checkered flag. The last time one
of them came over to my table I thought the building
was on fire.
It wouldn't matter quite so much, however, if
they'd just give you a chance to order. I realize this
business of telling the waiter precisely what you
would like to have is strictly a provincialism, dis
tinctly out of place in the Continental atmosphere
of the Peninsula's French Restaurant . . . hut at
four bucks a throw, I figure I'm entitled to stand on
my head and whistle Dixie (also a quaint provin
cialism) if I feel like it.
But the way these babies launch into their spiel,
write down half the menu and take off before you've
said "Cocquilles St. Jacque Robinson," you'd think
their mothers were scared by F. E. Boone.
This stuff has got to go. How about it, Andre? Or
is the Egg getting a little chicken? If you know what
I mean.

Why don't the waiters at L'Ommie's wise up?
For my dough, Andre has far and away the best
all around bistro in these parts, and the people he's
got working there in the bar are as nice a crowd as
you'd care to meet. But where did he dig up that gang

of hysterical Frenchmen who wait
on you—if you're lucky—in the
dining room?
Now I can't admit being a
habitue of the L'Omelette chow
line, unfortunately. But every
now and then I do manage to
blackmail my father into treating
me to Child's Plate there, and I
even worked as a bus boy in the

dining room for a week once, until Andre told me he'd
double my salary if I'd quit. So I do have some basis
