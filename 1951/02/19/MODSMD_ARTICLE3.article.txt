WASHINGTON — Sen. Robert A.
Taft, R., 0., said today the United
States may end up sending "a mil
lion boys to Europe" unless Congress
limits this nation's contribution to
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's unified
Atlantic Pact defense force.
He made the statement as the Sen
ate Foreign Relations and Armed
Services committees prepared to re-

surne public hearings on the admin
istration's plan to send 100,000 more
troops to Western Europe, where
two U.S. divisions already are sta
tioned.
Taft has led GOP forces demand
ing Congressional curbs on the troop
movement, while Gov. Thomas E.
Dewey has been the leading spokes
man for Republicans who endorse
the plan.
Former President Herbert Hoover,
who opposes sending any troops
whatever at present, declined an in
vitation to testify.
