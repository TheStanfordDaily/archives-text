# Stanford Blanked 2 to 0 By Former Cardinal Ace
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Baseball season officially opened Saturday afternoon in the
Sunken Diamond as Stanford dropped a 2 to 0 decision to the
Palo Alto Oaks.
However, the several hundred Stanford fans, who braved the
chilling wind and threatening skies, were treated to an excellent

pitchers' duel between the Oaks'
Dave Dahle and Stanford's Roger
Osenbaugh, Jim Claypool, and Joe
Chez.
Dahle, former Card ace, kept the
situation under control throughout
the game with his sturdy left arm.
He showed good control all the way,
keeping the Indian batters off bal
ance with an assortment of curves
and change of pace deliveries.
The Cards were able to garner
only three singles off his offerings.
Stanford Threatens
Stanford threatened only once.
Chuck Essegian led off the filth with
a single over second, and Bill Her
ron followed by drawing one of the
two bases on balls that Dahle issued.
Jim Claypool then laid down a
sacrifice bunt to move Essegian and
Herron to third and second with only
one down. However, Dahle bore

down, and got Bruce Cameron and
Art Abrahamson to fly out to Charlie
Cole in center field.
Monte Pfyl and Duane Crawford
teamed up to score both of the Oaks'
runs off starting Stanford hurler
Osenbaugh.
In the first inning, with Pfyl on
second, Crawford dropped a high fly
ball along the third-base line. It fell
between Essegian and Tom Shaw,
and Ply! came around to score the
first run of the game.
In the third frame Crawford laced
a single over second base to score
Pfyl from third with the second and
final run of the game.
Ilurlers Stingy
Claypool and Chez followed Osen
baugh to the mound for three in
nings of work apiece. Both allowed
only one single for their three-in
ning stints, and no Oak advanced
past first base after the third frame.
While the Indians left much to be
desired at the plate, their defensive
play was definitely above par for the
first game of the season.
Converted catcher Jim Castagnoli
looked good in his first appearance
at first base. While he still has a
few of the finer points of playing the
position to learn, Cas is catching on
quickly and should prove to be a
valuable addition in the lineup, not
only for his hitting prowess but for
Ihe constant line of chatter he uses
to keep the infield fired up.
The keystone combination of
Cameron at shortstop and Abraham
son at second base played steady—
at times almost sensational—baJi.

Osenbaugh.
In the first inning, with Pfyl on
second, Crawford dropped a high fly
ball along the third-base line. It fell
between Essegian and Tom Shaw,
and Ply! came around to score the
first run of the game.
In the third frame Crawford laced
a single over second base to score
Pfyl from third with the second and
final run of the game.
Ilurlers Stingy
Claypool and Chez followed Osen
baugh to the mound for three in
nings of work apiece. Both allowed
only one single for their three-in
ning stints, and no Oak advanced
past first base after the third frame.
While the Indians left much to be
desired at the plate, their defensive
play was definitely above par for the
first game of the season.
Converted catcher Jim Castagnoli
looked good in his first appearance
at first base. While he still has a
few of the finer points of playing the
position to learn, Cas is catching on
quickly and should prove to be a
valuable addition in the lineup, not
only for his hitting prowess but for
Ihe constant line of chatter he uses
to keep the infield fired up.
The keystone combination of
Cameron at shortstop and Abraham
son at second base played steady—
at times almost sensational—baJi.

—Pitches one-hit ball
Baseball season officially opened Saturday afternoon in the
Sunken Diamond as Stanford dropped a 2 to 0 decision to the
Palo Alto Oaks.
However, the several hundred Stanford fans, who braved the
chilling wind and threatening skies, were treated to an excellent

pitchers' duel between the Oaks'
Dave Dahle and Stanford's Roger
Osenbaugh, Jim Claypool, and Joe
Chez.
Dahle, former Card ace, kept the
situation under control throughout
the game with his sturdy left arm.
He showed good control all the way,
keeping the Indian batters off bal
ance with an assortment of curves
and change of pace deliveries.
The Cards were able to garner
only three singles off his offerings.
Stanford Threatens
Stanford threatened only once.
Chuck Essegian led off the filth with
a single over second, and Bill Her
ron followed by drawing one of the
two bases on balls that Dahle issued.
Jim Claypool then laid down a
sacrifice bunt to move Essegian and
Herron to third and second with only
one down. However, Dahle bore

down, and got Bruce Cameron and
Art Abrahamson to fly out to Charlie
Cole in center field.
Monte Pfyl and Duane Crawford
teamed up to score both of the Oaks'
runs off starting Stanford hurler
Osenbaugh.
In the first inning, with Pfyl on
second, Crawford dropped a high fly
ball along the third-base line. It fell
between Essegian and Tom Shaw,
