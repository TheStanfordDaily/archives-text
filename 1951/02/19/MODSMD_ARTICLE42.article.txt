The Indian swimming team waxed
a feeble San Jose State team, GG to 9,
in a dual meet at San Jose Thursday
night.
Stanford took first and second in
every race hut the breaststroke,
where the Spartans' excellent
freshman, Howard Hays, beat out
Dayr Peterman for the number
two spot.
Only three of the Card mermen
turned in good times in the slow in
door Spartan pool. Bob Frojen swam
his 100 - yard breaststroke in the
medley relay in 1:01.4, his best time
ever.
Winning easily, Bill Glathe piled
up the most points he has ever got
in the diving. Pierre Hathaway,
number three backstroker, showed
definite promise in the 200 - yard
backstroke as he knocked seven sec
onds off his previous best time in
taking second.
The capacity crowd was thrilled
by the antics of Bruce Harlan in
his comedy diving exhibition.
In the middle of his act, the for
mer NCAA champion diver from
Ohio State fell off the board onto the
concrete, landing on his rear end.
He finished his act and was hustled
to the Palo Alto Hospital for a mor
phine shot.
