# Braves to Play California Blues
## 
### 
Stanford's Braves take up the
court wars again this evening when
they tangle with an invading Cali
fornia Blues squad at G in the Pa
vilion.
In meeting the Blues for the sec
ond time this season, the Braves will
be out to avenge a G3 to 37 shellack
ing handed them by the Berkeley
boys last Jan. 12. In addition, the
junior varsity will be shooting for
its sixth consecutive win.
The last time out the locals es
tablished a Pavilion scoring record
of 92 points when they routed Ala
meda NAS 92 to 57.
The Blues are the tallest team that
the Braves have met this year. Cali
fornia's starting five averages a
"mere" 6 ft. 4'/2 in. It was the shoot
ing of Frank Hoaglund and A 1 Rose,
who got 13 and 12 points respective
ly, that broke the Braves' back in the
last Blue encounter.
