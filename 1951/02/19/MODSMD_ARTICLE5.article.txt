# Student Survives Three-Story Drop
## 
### 
John Stahr, 18-year-old freshman, fell from his third-story En
cina window early Sunday morning as the result of a fraternity
prank.
Stahr, who suffered a compound skull fracture and several
broken ribs, was taken by ambulance to the Palo Alto Hospital. He

is expected to recover.
Stahr and several other AKL
pledges stole all the silver from the
AKL House late Saturday evening
and hid it in Stahr's room. At 12:30
a.m. the other pledges knocked on
Stahr's door.
It had been raining, and, when
Stahr attempted to hide on the win
dow ledge, he slipped. He fell partly
on the sidewalk underneath his win
dow and partly on the ground and
remained there fully conscious until
an ambulance arrived at 1 o'clock.
He was taken to the hospital and his
head was operated on at 3 o'clock.
Dean of Men Richard L. Balch,
when informed of the incident,
stressed the need for judgment about
'"harmless pranks." "Frankly, he said,
"this is a good example of how in
nocent pranks end up in disaster and
death." He said that Stahr was
lucky to be alive.
Stahr's parents, Dr. and Mrs. Row
land Stahr of Reno, flew to Stanford
yesterday to be with their son.
This is the third time someone has
fallen from an upper story Encina
window in the last five years. Shaun
Holman and Douglas White fell also.
