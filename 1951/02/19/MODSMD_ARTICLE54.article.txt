# Fresh Air Classes Herald Springtime
## Lake Full, Libe Bare 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
Stanford students are on the
move — another big move out
doors. The bright sunshine,
which has been appearing in
between cold drizzles of rain
during the past weeks, heralds
the return of spring.
Convertible tops are coming down
and Hawaiian shirts are brightening
up the Quad. The Reserve Book
Room has suddenly become unbear
ably stuffy as eager students take
their books out on the Libe lawn.
Peaceful smiles grace their sleeping
faces.
Beachtimc
Around the living groups, beach
time is the favorite topic of conver
sation as new bathing suits come up
for approval. Every car - owner is
getting highly fastidious, since car-,
washing is a good excuse to bask in
the sun.
Fraternity men are venturing out
on their sun porches bare - chested
and wearing sun glasses, with books
only an incidental part of their
equipment. Spring training is bring
ing back activity to baseball dia
monds, which have lain soggy and
forgotten during the winter.
Lag Full
The weather is already good
enough for the opening of Lake Lag.
Stanford's own swimming pool has
been full for some time, with croak
ing frogs acting as press agents.
The signs of spring are here, and
in a few short weeks the campus will
be subject to a severe epidemic far
beyond the aid of the Health Serv
ice. Spring fever is around the cor
ner, and there's no antitoxin.


ARTIST'S IDEAL—Budding artists all over the campus have
taken advantage of the weather. Doing landscapes is a pleasure
when it means a suntan, too. —Daily photo by A 1 McCombs
