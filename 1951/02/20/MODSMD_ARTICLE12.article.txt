Panel Objectives
There arc three main objectives of
the panel discussion, said Carl Sto
ver, chairman of Forum Committee.
The first is to clarify the aims and
purposes of Stanford education. The
second is to evaluate the manner in
which Stanford's educational pro
gram meets the needs of the student.
Finally, Stover said, the panel
hopes to bring faculty and student
thinking together around the most
vital issues concerning Stanford edu
cation.
The poll, which will be used as a
point of reference in the discussion,
was taken by John Traynor, chair
man of the ASSU Survey Commit
tee. Students were interviewed on
subjects ranging from the general
value of Stanford education to the
merits of the quarter system and the
Stanford curve.
