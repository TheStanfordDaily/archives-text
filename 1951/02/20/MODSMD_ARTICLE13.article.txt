## Contact Made By Radio Club 
### 
Last week Hans Rossi, Stan
ford foreign scholarship student
from Switzerland, spoke to a ra
dio operator in a neighboring
suburb of Zurich through the
Stanford University Radio Club.
Brad Wyatt, who was operating
the station, established contact with
a friend in Greenland, who in turn ,
reached the operator in Goldow,
Switzerland, 40 miles from Hans'
home town.
Hans exhanged a few words with !
the operator in German, who then j
played some Swiss music for Hans.
But the greatest thrill came when
the operator phoned Hans' mother
and told her that her son was now !
spcakinc to him from California.
The intercontinental hook-up last
ed 50 minutes, and the Swiss student
said it was just like talking over the
telephoneâ€”only this was free.
Wyatt explained that it is difficult
for amateur operators to establish ;
I contacts such as this one. The Stan- [
j ford Radio Club has tried several I
' times in the past to get hook-ups for 1
I foreign students with their homes,
