# University to Construct Two Electronics Labs
## Plans $250,000 Outlay for Research, Electrical Engineering Programs 
### 
Tv/o new electronics laboratories, one for applied research and
the other for student electrical engineering activities, will be con
structed at Stanford, it was announced today by President Wallace
Sterling.
The new facilities, to be located between the University's Micro-

••— - — • ——i — —
wave Laboratory and the Wast side
of the Quad, main body of Umiver
sity buildings, will repiosent a $250, -
000 outlay.
At the same time the president an
nounced that the University has re
ceived an Office of Naval Research
contract for a research program in
applied electronics. The grant, sum
of which was not disclosed, supple
ments existing basic research con
tracts held by the University with
ONF, the Air Force, Signal Corps,
the National Bureau of Standards.
Construction of the student clor
trical engineering laboratory,
which will be in the form of a wing
adjoining the applied research cen
ter, was made possible through a
gift from Hewlett-Packard Com
pany of Palo Alto, electronics
equipment manufacturing firm
headed by two Stanford graduates,
William Hewlett and David Pack
ard, both of the class of 1934.
This wing, on the south side of the
applied reseach laboratory, will bn
the center of electronics construction
at the University. It will include
classrooms, laboratories, workshops
where students can work with ra
dios and try out their own ideas in
unsponsored research, a library, nftd
student lounge.
The applied research laboratory
and the student activities wing will
be of contemporary design, with a
wood-framed structure, concretc
floor, exterior walls of concrete
blocks, wood, and glass, and with a
slightly sloping roof, resembling in
general appearance the University's
Microwave Laboratory and the Or
ganic Chemistry Laboratory, both
: constructed in recent years.
Dr. Sterling, who made the an
nouncement of the new buildings
just prior to leaving for a three
week trip East, said the University
will seek bids for the construction
work this week and hopes to begin
construction as soon as possible,
j The buildings will have 13.500
j square feet of floor space and will be
1 about three-quarters as large as the
| Microwave Laboratory, where the
; Universty is constructing a new-type
J atom smasher, the electron linear a r -
j celerator, under another ONR con
tract.
Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard said
that their company's gift to the Uni
• versity was made in appreciation of
! the training they had received at
Stanford, and the opportunity they
J had had to carry on their own expsr
i iments in the old radio laboratory
which is located in the attic of
the present Elcctrical Engineering
Building.

William Hewlett and David Pack
ard, both of the class of 1934.
This wing, on the south side of the
applied reseach laboratory, will bn
the center of electronics construction
at the University. It will include
classrooms, laboratories, workshops
where students can work with ra
dios and try out their own ideas in
unsponsored research, a library, nftd
student lounge.
The applied research laboratory
and the student activities wing will
be of contemporary design, with a
wood-framed structure, concretc
floor, exterior walls of concrete
blocks, wood, and glass, and with a
slightly sloping roof, resembling in
general appearance the University's
Microwave Laboratory and the Or
ganic Chemistry Laboratory, both
: constructed in recent years.
Dr. Sterling, who made the an
nouncement of the new buildings
just prior to leaving for a three
week trip East, said the University
will seek bids for the construction
work this week and hopes to begin
construction as soon as possible,
j The buildings will have 13.500
j square feet of floor space and will be
1 about three-quarters as large as the
| Microwave Laboratory, where the
; Universty is constructing a new-type
J atom smasher, the electron linear a r -
j celerator, under another ONR con
tract.
Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard said
that their company's gift to the Uni
• versity was made in appreciation of
! the training they had received at
Stanford, and the opportunity they
J had had to carry on their own expsr
i iments in the old radio laboratory
which is located in the attic of
the present Elcctrical Engineering
Building.

Tv/o new electronics laboratories, one for applied research and
the other for student electrical engineering activities, will be con
structed at Stanford, it was announced today by President Wallace
Sterling.
The new facilities, to be located between the University's Micro-

At the same time the president an
nounced that the University has re

contract for a research program in
applied electronics. The grant, sum
of which was not disclosed, supple

ONF, the Air Force, Signal Corps,

Construction of the student clor
