# Man Plans Rocket Ship For Moon

### 
POINT MUGU, Calif., Feb. 19
(UP) —To people who would like to
go to the moon and back in a rocket
ship 27 stories high, Arthur V. St.
j Germain, an engineer, says he has
plans for just such a missile—one
that can carry two men.
"We are closer to that event today
than most people realize," St. Ger
main said.
St. Germain is senior test engineer
for the Fairchild Guided Missiles Di
j vision at the Navy's test center here.
His 180-ton rocket would be built
in five stages and would make the
trip to the moon at a speed of 25,000
; miles an hour. Only five pounds of
j uranium would be needed to provide
j enough fuel for the round trip, St.
I Germain said.
Once free of the earth's gravity,
the rocket could coast the rest of the
| way, he claims. It would land on the
! moon stern first so the tail blast
could slow down the moon's gravity
j to permit a gentle landing.
He said on the return trip, the
rockct would speed along at seven
miles a second and would land stern
first or else the cabin would be para
chuted down.
St. Germain's rocket would be
built in five sections, four of which
would be used for propulsion. Each
would be dropped as its fuel was
j consumed.
A complete 100-foot 15-ton finned
! rocket ship housing the cabin and
instruments comprises the fifth sec
tion, St. Germain explained. The five
sections together would be 325 feet
i long.
Although St. Germain displayed a
complete set of blueprints for the
rocket ship, he said he had no imme
i diate plans to construct a workable
! model.
