# MY PRIVATE LIFE
## 
### PVT. BILL DAILEY 
Several "Private Lives" ago I promised to write a
' . t-rious" column about the present army method of
personnel classification and job assignment. Since I
have just completed my own private roundelay with
the classification and assignment office, this seems to

be an opportune time to pass T
along the "word." All you young ,
ladies may now stop reading and
: witch to Palmieri's "Bull Ses
sion." Prospective draftees . . . i
'"Ten-Shun!" . . . Gad what a *
revolting word.)
At the present the procedure t . :
for determining the final place- 112
ment of a draftee is as follows:
1. Upon completion of four or
five days of pre-basic "proces- *

sing," you will be assigned to an infantry company
lor either a 6-week or 14-week cycle of basic training,
fl you are in good physical condition but have no
particular skill or advanced education, you will prob
ably be assigned to the 14-week cycle. Most of the
men assigned to this cycle will eventually become
members of combat infantry, armored, or artillery
units.
ft you are a college graduate, possess a certain trade
• kill (e.g., auto mechanic), or if you have some ohysi
eal defect (e.g., glasses), you will in all probability be
:fMt to the six-week training cycle for basic.
The fundamental difference between the two
cycles is that the men in the six-week cycle are sup
posed to be assigned to an army school at the end
of their basic training. These schools train you as
cooks or bakers, auto mechanics, electricians, code
men. clerks and typists, and many other jobs.
Now I can hear you guys sounding off with two loud
questions: "If I'm drafted, how do I get in Officer Can
didate School?" and, "Will my college diploma help
me to get a break in the army?"
The answer to the question about OCS is that the
trail from an ordinary draft induction notice to an
officer's commission is a long one.
First you must pass the Officer's Candidate Test
when you go through your first week of "processing."
Second, you are required to take 14 weeks of basic
training.

Third, you must attend four weeks of "Leadership
School." a course in the techniques of leadership.
Fourth, you must then work as a "cadre" or assistant
platoon sergeant for a period of from one to three
months, depending upon when an opening for you
occurs at Officer's School.
Fifth, you now attend Officer's Candidate School for
six months. If you receive your commission you must
sign an enlistment for at least two years of active
duty, plus agreeing to hold a reserve commission after
your discharge from active service.
So you can see. men, it ain't easy. (And if you hap
pen to wear glasses, as does yours truly, at present
you won't even be considered for OCS, no matter how
high you are on the* qualification test.
In answer to the question about the value of your
college degree in regard to your service assignment,
the present situation is this:
If you hold or will hold a Bachelor of Science de
gree, especially in some field of engineering, you have
an excellent chance of being assigned to a unit called
Specialized Profession Personnel. All men assigned
to this group are given six months of basic training
and then sent to Fort Meyers, Virginia, for further
classification and assignment, to army work in their
own special field.
Exceptional men have been given direct commis
sions—i.e., without attending OCS—because of their
special knowledge. But most men in this group are
given non-commission grades, along with a job which
is usually quite interesting.
For the legion of you fellows who will graduate
with a Bachelor of Arts degree, it won't do you
much good with the army, unless perhaps it is in
Econ, preferably in accounting.
All of you majors in history, English, political sci
ence, et al, will find army classification as excited over
your degree are they were over mine in speech and
drama, which was practically nil.
That's about the picture as of today. Take it for
what it's worth to you, but remember all of this pres
ent setup may change overnight.

the characters in my outfit, and a few of the laughs
which have emerged from four weeks of basic train
ing.)

men. clerks and typists, and many other jobs.
Now I can hear you guys sounding off with two loud
questions: "If I'm drafted, how do I get in Officer Can
didate School?" and, "Will my college diploma help
me to get a break in the army?"
The answer to the question about OCS is that the
trail from an ordinary draft induction notice to an
officer's commission is a long one.
First you must pass the Officer's Candidate Test
when you go through your first week of "processing."
Second, you are required to take 14 weeks of basic
training.

Third, you must attend four weeks of "Leadership
School." a course in the techniques of leadership.
Fourth, you must then work as a "cadre" or assistant
platoon sergeant for a period of from one to three
months, depending upon when an opening for you
occurs at Officer's School.
Fifth, you now attend Officer's Candidate School for
six months. If you receive your commission you must
sign an enlistment for at least two years of active
duty, plus agreeing to hold a reserve commission after
your discharge from active service.
So you can see. men, it ain't easy. (And if you hap
pen to wear glasses, as does yours truly, at present
you won't even be considered for OCS, no matter how
high you are on the* qualification test.
In answer to the question about the value of your
college degree in regard to your service assignment,
the present situation is this:
If you hold or will hold a Bachelor of Science de
gree, especially in some field of engineering, you have
an excellent chance of being assigned to a unit called
Specialized Profession Personnel. All men assigned
to this group are given six months of basic training
and then sent to Fort Meyers, Virginia, for further
classification and assignment, to army work in their
own special field.
Exceptional men have been given direct commis
sions—i.e., without attending OCS—because of their
special knowledge. But most men in this group are
given non-commission grades, along with a job which
is usually quite interesting.
For the legion of you fellows who will graduate
with a Bachelor of Arts degree, it won't do you
much good with the army, unless perhaps it is in
Econ, preferably in accounting.
All of you majors in history, English, political sci
ence, et al, will find army classification as excited over
your degree are they were over mine in speech and
drama, which was practically nil.
That's about the picture as of today. Take it for
what it's worth to you, but remember all of this pres
ent setup may change overnight.
(Next "Private Life": We take a look at some of
the characters in my outfit, and a few of the laughs
which have emerged from four weeks of basic train
ing.)

Several "Private Lives" ago I promised to write a
' . t-rious" column about the present army method of
personnel classification and job assignment. Since I
have just completed my own private roundelay with
the classification and assignment office, this seems to

be an opportune time to pass T
along the "word." All you young ,
ladies may now stop reading and

sion." Prospective draftees . . . i

revolting word.)
At the present the procedure t . :
for determining the final place- 112
ment of a draftee is as follows:
1. Upon completion of four or
five days of pre-basic "proces- *

sing," you will be assigned to an infantry company
lor either a 6-week or 14-week cycle of basic training,
fl you are in good physical condition but have no
particular skill or advanced education, you will prob
ably be assigned to the 14-week cycle. Most of the
men assigned to this cycle will eventually become
members of combat infantry, armored, or artillery
units.
ft you are a college graduate, possess a certain trade
• kill (e.g., auto mechanic), or if you have some ohysi
eal defect (e.g., glasses), you will in all probability be
:fMt to the six-week training cycle for basic.
The fundamental difference between the two
cycles is that the men in the six-week cycle are sup
posed to be assigned to an army school at the end
of their basic training. These schools train you as
cooks or bakers, auto mechanics, electricians, code

to this group are given six months of basic training
and then sent to Fort Meyers, Virginia, for further
classification and assignment, to army work in their
own special field.
Exceptional men have been given direct commis
sions—i.e., without attending OCS—because of their
special knowledge. But most men in this group are
given non-commission grades, along with a job which
is usually quite interesting.
For the legion of you fellows who will graduate
with a Bachelor of Arts degree, it won't do you
much good with the army, unless perhaps it is in
Econ, preferably in accounting.
All of you majors in history, English, political sci
ence, et al, will find army classification as excited over
your degree are they were over mine in speech and
drama, which was practically nil.
That's about the picture as of today. Take it for
what it's worth to you, but remember all of this pres
ent setup may change overnight.
(Next "Private Life": We take a look at some of
the characters in my outfit, and a few of the laughs
which have emerged from four weeks of basic train
ing.)
