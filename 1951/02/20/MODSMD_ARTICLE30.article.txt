# SIR GEORGE SANSOM, BRITISH DIPLOMAT
## British Author Discusses Japan; Urges New Approach to East 
### 
"This is terrible," Sir George
Sansom said Friday afternoon
as he faced a room full of inter
ested Far East observers from
Stanford and University of Cali
fornia, "I thought I was just
going to sit around a table and
talk to half a dozen people. This
looks like a lecture."
Sir George, author and British dip
lomat in the Far East from 1904 to
19159, gave the group a brief account
of his lectures made before Japanese
students in the University of Tokyo
last December.
His purpose, he said, was to point
out to Japanese academic circles
the advances made by the West in
accumulating a greater store of
knowledge about the Orient.
According to Sir George, the time
has come for a new approach to
Japanese history by Western stu
dents. With a knowledge vastly en
larged and specialized, the first phase,
or narrative approach, should give
way to a descriptive and compara
tive approach. Sir George said.
' We tend to exaggerate Japan's
isolation," Sir George stated. West
( iners accustomed to world travels
often forget that Europe was one iso
lated. It was one of the five distinct
continents, unrelated in world events.
Sir George feels that Western
students can make their greatest
contribution to Japanese historical
studies by comparing and contrast
ing their knowledge of Western
periods to parallel eras in Japanese
history.
"I think we will agree that it is bad
to study 19th century Japan by 20th
century Western standards," Sir
George asserted. "The comparative
method wiil avoid these pitfalls."
Although the West regards the

concept of universalism as natural,
that view is the exception in Japa- I
nese history, Sir George pointed out. '
In the sunny Carnegie Room of |
Hoover Library, Sir George sug
gested several possible topics of fur
ther Western studies to the group of
Far Eastern students.
'Here is work for v specialist,"
Sir George said. To trace the an
alogy between the development of
Christianity in Europe and Budd
hism in Japan, stressing the revo- '

lution of Buddhism as it was sub
jected to Japanese life and thought.
Sir George, attired in a black oin
stripe suit with a grey tie that
matched his hair, repeated his part
ing conversation with the President
of the Japanese University, who
said:
"Ah, you have dropped a bomb, Sir
George."
And with his pleasant wit, the frail
diplomat observed, "Yes, but not
atomic."


FAR EAST EXPERT â€” Sir George Sansom, world-famed au
thority on Japanese history and former British diplomat, inspects
an anonymous gift of 411 volumes of Japanese books of the 17th
and 18th centuries presented to Hoover Library. The gift was in
honor of Sir George's visit here. Nobutake Ike, curator of Japa
nese collections at Stanford, looks over Sir George's shoulder.
