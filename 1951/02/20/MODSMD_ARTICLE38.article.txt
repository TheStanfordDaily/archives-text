It's Up to llu 4 Hooters
This may sound surprising, but the outcome of this week's basketball dou
bleheader with the USC Trojans may depend upon the vocal antics of you,
the Stanford rooter. USC is probably the best team in the PCC Southern
Division, and it is undoubtedly the dirtiest.
Every team commits fouls, but the Trojans are probably the only team
that premeditatedly employs fouls as a defense. They'd much rather have
an opponent get one free shot than let him get in scoring position for a two
pointer.
Consider the fact that Stanford, a fast break team, only once shook a
man loose on the fast break in one of their games against the Trojans.
The thugs from Troy would rather rack up a man than let him break down
the court. Consider also the fact that in the last half of the Saturday game,
Stanford took more shots from the free shot line than they did from the
floor. And things like that don't happen very often—unless you play the
kids from Troy.
Also consider the fact that one SCer (we won't give his name) is probably
the only player in basketball history to have chalked up more fouls than
he has points.
The inept Southland refs, with the partisan Trojan rooters howling in
their ears, neglected to call a lot of fouls they should have. A classic ex
ample of this is the time Jim Walsh got cracked above the eye. Walsh
had to have five stitches put in, and did USC receive a foui? No, Stan
ford was charged with a time out by the Southland zebra-shirts.
Someone may ask, "Why doesn't Stanford play the same way?" First of
all, it would be quite un-Stanlordish (to use an A 1 Berry term) for the In
dian cages to lower themselves to USC's standards. Secondly, boys like
Tucker, Ramstead, Iversen, etc.. aren't evilly-constituted. No doubt they
love their mothers, go to church on Sundays, and pet stray dogs. They want
to win their games cleanly, without resorting to pier six tactics.
Get on 'Em, Gang
The Trojans' fouls are often subtle—stuff like sticking out a hip, getting
hold of an opponent's free hand, sticking out the elbows, or sticking a foot
where it will do the most good. That's where you, the rooter, come in.
When an SCer does an un-nice thing, yell—loud and long. If the refs miss
some of the dirty work, let's let 'em know about it—loud and long. In
short, let's demand a game that is straight and clean—the way a game ought
to be played.
Let's get on 'em, gang.

Look, Fellows, It's Delano!
The whistle-stop town of Delano, George Zaninovich's stamping grounds,
is a standing joke among the basketball team members and George's Delt
fraternity brothers. On the team flight to Los Angeles last week, the plane
was lazily flying over checkered, barren terrain. Suddenly, George jumped
up, "Look, Pete, look, Frit/. (Ftnster), look Bill (Stevenson), there it is,
there it is!!!
"There's what?" we chorused.
'"Down there, don't you see it—Delano!!"
"No," was our disinterested reply.
"Don't you see it?" shouted George. "It's right behind that little mound
over there. I'm telling you, that's Delano!"
We looked down, and all we could see was the same barren, checkered
terrain. "That's all light, George, you just put your head back and go to
sleep. You're a little tired."
George muttered something about his being sure that was Delano, and
the airplane continued its lazy flight over the nondescript countryside.
