## Varsity Cagers Home to Stay; Host USC Twice This Weekend 
### 
Coach Everett Dean gave his
"luckless" Indians the day off yes
terelay, since the Brave-Blue game
was occupying the Pavilion, and an
nounced a heavy workout today in
preparation for the Friday and Sat
urday night tilt.s with USC on the
Farm.
Back home after a pair of defeats
at the hands of the Bruins of UCLA,
Dean stated that the Cards should

have won the first gams Friday
night. They showed their best form
of the season and produced a fine
team game. Main reason for the loss,
Dean exclaimed, was that they blew
too many of the short shots that they
had, and there weer many.
The Card headman also went on
to say, "Saturday night it was just
a case fo too much UCLA and too
much Eddie Sheldrake. But don't
get the idea that the boys just threw

in the sponge. They played just as
hard and as fast in the last 10 se
onds as they did in the first."
This weekend the Indians go
against another southland team, the
Trojans of USC, and will find it
tough sledding, as SC, leading the
PCC race with a six-win, two-loss
record, has already dumped the
Cards twice in their home territory.
The Indians cannot be counted
out, however, and, with their own
court under them, will give the Tro
jans a run for their money.
