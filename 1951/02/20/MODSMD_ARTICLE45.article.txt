# Card Nine Meets Boston Today; Murphy Will Start
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Stanford Indians vs. the Boston
Braves at 3:15 on the Sunken Dia
mond.
That's today's baseball card, but
lest you get any illusions of view
ing John Sain, Warren Spahn, or
Bob Elliot crank up this afternoon,
it must be added that these are the
Boston Brave Rookies, the major
league stars of the future.
Managed by Bill Marshall, one of

the leading Brave scouts in the West
and a former major league shortstop,
the Braves are composed mainly of
the parent club's minor league chat
tels with a sprinkling of Pittsburgh
Pirate farmhands thrown in.
Top men on the Braves' totem pole
are their battery of Red Walsh
pitching and Gene Roselli catching.
Both performed for the Caliofrnia
League pennant winners, the Ven
tura Braves. Throwing to All —
j League catcher Roselli, Walsh post
i ed a 19 and 4 record, and on the
! basis of this performance gets a trial
with Milwaukee this year.
Another Ventura star, Lucky Vi
tal, will start in right field, and will

soon be on his way to spring train
ing with Atlanta fo the Southern
Assoiation.
Frank Nubin of Denver in the
Class A Western Assoiation goes in
enter, and John Worley, a young
prospest out of San Jose, is in left.
Bob Dallas, ex - St. Mary's Hash
and a good sticker, handles second.
Duane Eckert, a converted catcher,
is at first, Sal Campagna at third, and
A 1 Facchini at short. All three for
merly played in the Peninsula
League. Campagna and Eckert are
in the Pirate chain, while Facchini
had a good year with the Class C Eau
Claire Club.
Other hurlers to see possible ac
tion are Frank Auilar, who pitched
in the California State and Far West
circuits last year, and Tom Del Sarto,
a lefty out of Sequoia High School.
For the Indians, Assistant Coach
Dutch Fehring's theme song after
Saturday's loss was "Where, Oh
Where Have My Big Hitters Gone?"
But he hopes to change his tune with
a crescendo of base knocks aimed by
his charges at the Braves' hurlers.
Bespectacled Bob Murphy, who
has more pitches than Heinz has va
rieties, has received Fehring's nomi
nation for opening hill duties. He'll
be throwing to "Yogi" Dick Corzine,
but otherwise the lineup remains the
same.
