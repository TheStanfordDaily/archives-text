Free enterprise provides
America's best hope for so
cially satisfying cities of the fu
ture, Ralph Walker, president of
the American Institute of Archi
tecture, declared yesterday in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Giving the first of a scries of three
talks on the potential American city.

talism and Jheir effects on architec
ture. In talks tomorrow at 4:15 and
Friday at 8 p.m. in Cubberley he
will discuss present trends which
are now shaping the future city and
what the nation must do to analyze
its top architectural, possibilities.
"I believe architects have got to be
trained as missionaries to check the
sprawl of present cities," Walker
said. "'Modern cities arc ugly; the ad
vertising man has had more effect
than the architect."
Blaming a lack of individual en
terprise for housing projcct abuses,
the architect called the buildings
"vast slab-like structures, housing
irresponsible hordes." He stressed
the need for city planning by "will
ing co-operation of intelligent indi
viduals."
Walker urged humanization and
consideration of the spiritual aspect
of building. We need "something
greater than the sticks and stones
from which we build," he said.
Walker was one of the designers of
the United Nations' Lake Success
buildings. He designed the U.S.
Army bases in the Caribbean.
