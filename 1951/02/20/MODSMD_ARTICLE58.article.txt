# Unknown Check-Passer Poses as Stanford Student
## 
### 
A man identifying himself as
Richard C. Olsen, Stanford student,
has been cashing fictitious checks in
Palo Alto.
Stanford University officials said
yesterday they have received re
ports of the presumed Stanford stu
dent. The man uses a Stanford stu
dent body card as a means of identi
fication, but the University has no
student by that name registered.
University authorities believe the
card is a stolen one, with the name
on it changed.
One store said he was wearing a
Stanford jacket, and gave a frater
nity house address and phone num
ber as his residence. However,
checking them yielded no further
information.
Richard L. Balch, Chief Counselor
for Men, said that he and the Uni
versity were anxious to make every
effort to co-operate with Palo Alto
merchants, in order that Stanford
students could continue to cash
checks and carry on other business
transactions satisfactorily in Palo
Alto.
