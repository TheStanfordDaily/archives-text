# RFC Plan Changed

### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Tru
man bowed to Congressional criti
cism today by proposing a reorgani
zation plan which would put the Re
construction Finance Corporation
under a single administrator and
erect strict new "safeguards" around
RFC loans.
His plan, an abrupt about - face
from his previous position, tallies
generally with recommendations by
a Senate Banking subcommittee
which accused the RFC of letting it
self be guided by an influence web
reaching into the White House itself.
