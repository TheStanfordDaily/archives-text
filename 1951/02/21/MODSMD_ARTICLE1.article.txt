### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 21 (UP)—American troops stabbed
forward 10 miles in Korea yesterday under orders to resume the
initiative, and it appeared the enemy was in flight all across the
front.
An Bth Army communique reported "some" enemy resistance

yesterday in the Chechon area below
Wonju but a 10th Corps spokesman
said today there was "evidence of a
hasty enemy withdrawal" in that
area.
Tough American Rangers already
had smashed the last threat of a
wrecked Communist offensive aimed
at ripping through Allied lines into
Central Korea and front dispatches
said the Reds were "routed" above ,
the rail and highway hub of Che- ,
chon.
A 10th Corps spokesman said Al
lied troops were moving forward
against "fading enemy resistance,"
driving northward almost at will in a
follow-up to the big victory to the j
west where the Red counter offensive
was thrown back With bloody losses, i
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur said on
his return from the Korean battle
front that United Nations troops are j
in excellent shape and that "every
thing is going fine."
Mac Arthur returned to Tokyo after
a flying visit to advance positions on j
the Wonju front in Central Korea j
where he directed "a resumption of
the initiative by our forces."


PUSH HIM UP, JOE —These engineers of a Ist Cavalry Divi
sion battalion must have a lot of faith in their work as they stand
under a weakened bridge near Yangzi, Korea, to shore it with
logs. The M-4 tank that caused the structure to sag will sit there
until a tank retriever arrives to remove it.
