# Monteux, Symphony 'Stimulating'
## 
### 
Last night's concert by Pierre
Monteux and the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra in Memorial
Auditorium was a very successful
one. The orchestra was in particu
larly good form, Conductor Mon
teux's direction was powerful and
tasteful, and the fine acoustics of the
hall gave the group a mellow, well
balanced sound.
The program itself offered much
that was stimulating. A recent Con
certo for Orchestra, for instance, by
David Sheinfeld of the Symphony's
first violin section, proved an emi
nently worthwhile and enjoyable
piece, one which reminded us of
Stravinsky and Martinu but has its
own personality.
Colorful Effects
It is characterized by what one
might call a democracy of orchestra
tion in that it treats the orchestra
soloistically, giving many soloists
and sections chances to stand out.
A multitude of colorful, varied ef
fects result. Sheinfeld's adept scor
ing, his fine sense for vital and tricky
rhythms, and his careful and appro
priate use of dissonance (notably for
humor) all gave pleasure to the ear.
One might add, however, that the
piece is rather kaleidoscopic and
over-indulges in climax.
Wagner's Successful
Monteux's other numbers were
three standard works of the Roman
tic period: Berlioz' "Corsair" Over
ture, Schumann's Fourth Symphony,
and "Siegfried's Rhine Journey"
from Wagner's "Gotterdaemmer
ung."
The broad melodic lines and busy
texture of the Berlioz never fail to
arouse our enthusiasm, and the
Schumann, despite its oppressive
thick orchestration and repetition,
revealed again its persuasive pas
j sages of melodic warmth and dy
namic - harmonic excitement. The
j "Rhine Journey" remains one of
| Wagner's most successful pieces.—
