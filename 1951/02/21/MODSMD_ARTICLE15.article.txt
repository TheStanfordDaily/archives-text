University of Illinois, a former pro- j
fessor at Stanford, died Feb. 10 at the ;
age of 87, and a week later made
national news when his will dis

The widely known mathematician, i
who was an associate professor of
mathematics at Stanford from 1901
to 1906, pyramided his small annual I
salary, which never topped $6,000.
into a fortuneâ€”but nobody knows
cxactly how he did it.
The professor was a familiar fig
ure on the Illinois campus. He
dressed plainly and often ate with
the students in the Union cafeteria.

Not even hi.s closest friends knew of
his wealth.
U. A. Manning, professor emeritus
of mathematics at Stanford, who did
hi.s doctoral work under Professor
Miller, believes that the latter was
"one of the finest toachcrs I ever
knew. He thought everything out;
he never left anything to memory
when he presented his lectures."
Professor Miller, who married the
sister of the deceased wife of O. M.
Johnson, professor emeritus of Ro
manic languages, lived very simply
while he was here at Stanford.
Of Pennsylvania Dutch stock, Mil
ler was a student at Muhlenberg
College in Pennsylvania. He stud

| ied in France for a year or two under
j the great. French mathematician Ca
i mille Jordan, and at Leipzig under
I Sophus Lie. One of his fellow class
mates was another famous mathc
j matician. L. E. Dickson.
After doing additional postgradu
j ate work at Cornell, he came to
I Stanford, where he stayed until
! 1906.
Miller was a member of the Amer
ican Academy of Sciences. He was a
| specialist in the theory of groups
| and wrote many papers on that sub
j ject. His collected works were pub
i lishrd by the University of Illinois
! as an honor to the professor when he
retired at the age of 65.
