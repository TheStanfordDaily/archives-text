# Student Poll Will Be Used In Forum on Education
## 
### 
Stanford students have no major objection to education at Stan
ford. But a poll, taken last week by the ASSU Survey Committee,
did reveal dissatisfaction on certain aspects of our educational
system.
This poll will be used as a point of reference at the ASSU Forum

Committee's panel discussion, "Edu
cation at Stanford: An Evaluation,"
to be held at 8 p.m. tonight in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club
house.
Members of the panel are Profes
sor Lawrence Thomas of the Educa
tion Department; Professor William
C. Bark, head of the Western Civil
ization Department; Lloyd W. Din
kelspiel, member of the Board of
Trustees; Alberta Engvall, member
of the Student-Faculty Education
Committee; and Professor John W.
Dodds, head of the special programs
in Humanities.
Good to Excellent
In answer to the question "What is
your spontaneous, frank evaluation
of the education you are receiving at
Stanford?" 90 per cent of those in
terviewed replied good, very good, or
excellent.
The greatest amount of dissatisfac
tion was directed against advising
and counseling. Sixty-four per cent
said that Lower Division advising
fell short of their educational stand
ards. Forty-one per cent were criti
cal of upper division advising, and 37
per cent of graduate advising.
Students also criticized lecture
courses at the lower division and
graduate levels. While upper divi
sion students were not dissatisfied
with their lecture courses, they did
want to have more seminars.
Of the 150 students selected at ran
dom for the poll, 76 per cent sup
; ported a faculty or course rating sys
tem. But many of them commented
that great care would have to be used
to set up such a system properly. A
large minority felt that student-fac
ulty relationship needed improve
ment.
Honor Code Endorsed
Ninety-four per cent preferred the
quarter system to the semester sys
tem, and 78 per cent approved of
testing and grading at Stanford. The
Honor Code was whole-heartedly
endorsed.
Besides considering the opinion®
expressed in the poll, the panel will
discuss liberal education, the im
portance of graduate schools, lower
division requirements, and other
educational issues at Stanford.


EVALUATION OF STANFORD—AIberta Engvall, Carl Stover, and Professors William C. Bark
and Lawrence Thomas discuss plans for the ASSU Forum which will take place tonight.
