# A 						Change in Attitude
## 
### 
Yesterday's sports page carried a column by
Daily sports reporter Pete Grothe in which fans
were asked to "get on" the referees in this
weekend's basketball tilts with the USC Tro
jans.
To begin with, it is not our purpose on the
editorial side to deny Pete the right to say what
he believes. By virtue of his work on the sports
.staff and his previous coverage of basketball
]at Stanford, we feel he is gualified to comment
as he sees fit.
1 In addition, columnist Grothe may well be
correct in his analysis of the USC basketballers
' —("undeniably the dirtiest team in the PCC
Southern Division").
We would take issue with him, however, on
his request to jump on the referees' backs, tac
tics which he implies might clean up the game
and give the Indians an even break against the
Trojans.
There is nothing we would like better than
to see two BASKETBALL games this weekend,
not a pair of slugfests. But upon closer exami
nation of the overall picture, Grothe's "vocal
antics" do not seem to be the solution.
In the first place, concentrated yelling, curs
ing, and catcalling may only serve to make
martyrs out of the Trojan hoopmen. Two years
ago, we jeered Karl Kraushaar, a husky UCLA
center who had been roundly denounced for
"dirty playing" in more than a few Daily sports
columns.
Yet, as the record proves, Kraushaar got no
- cleaner, nor did he lose his point-making and
: rebounding effectiveness as the season pro
gressed. He ended the year among the top 10
: Southern Division scorers and was even men
: tioned for all-loop honors by the Daily sports
pickers themselves.
: To. jingoistic UCLA supporters, Kraushaar
was a martyr. They blamed any dirty-playing
ideas they had had about him on the adverse
'• jeering, and praised him because he was able
• to take the "riding" and bounce back to score
at least as many points as before.
Stanford, on the other hand, came out a dou
ble loser. Most important, we lost basketball
games; but more than that, we disqualified our
selves from gaining prestige that might other
wise have been ours if we had assumed a
sportsmanlike air instead of adopting the direct
opposite.
Kraushaar may have been poor — likewise

Frank Wickhorst and ]eif Cravath—but it was
not our place to figuratively rip up the stands
and yell for the opposers — as Cal and USC
have done in the past—and all to their own
detriment.
Neither is it within our consciences to sanc
tion "vocal antics" aimed at the referees. The
refs are human beings. When they are being
shouted at, slurred, and denounced, it is hard
to imagine their "unbiased" feelings not be
coming deranged. If we persist in being un
sportsmanlike when our opponents are on the
free throw line, the refs can call a technical
foul against us. But more damaging, the men
in stripes can "hold a grudge" against the par
tisan rabble and take it out in fouls called—or
uncalled, as the case may be —at a crucial time
when the chips are down.
Both referees in Friday's and Saturday's con
tests (Lou Batmale and Ken Fagans) have been
approved by Coach Everett Dean, who is al
lowed a number of "peremptory" challenges
against referees at the beginning of each sea
son. Coach Dean has assured us that they are
honest and capable, and will do the best job
possible, under the circumstances.
It would be wrong to suggest that such men
— even though qualified — are impervious to
continued and uncalled-for jeering from the
audience.
To tie down our arguments, we herewith
publish two statements —one from Basketball
Coach Everett Dean, the other from player
captain Jack O'Sullivan — written to the stu
dents last night:
"We appreciate the fine support we have al
ways received from our rooting section. We
shall need that support more than ever this
weekend. However, it is my hope that the Stan
ford student body will show the same sports
manship toward Southern California players
and the officials that our boys display on the
floor. Please remember that visiting squads
and referees are our guests."
EVERETT S. DEAN
"I'm sure I speak for the entire basketball
squad when I say that we want to win these
two games this weekend more than any we
have played this season. I assure you that we
shall go all out, within the bounds of good
sportsmanship, to beat the Trojans. I know we
can count on our rooters to do likewise."

Yesterday's sports page carried a column by
Daily sports reporter Pete Grothe in which fans
were asked to "get on" the referees in this
weekend's basketball tilts with the USC Tro
jans.
To begin with, it is not our purpose on the
editorial side to deny Pete the right to say what
he believes. By virtue of his work on the sports
.staff and his previous coverage of basketball
]at Stanford, we feel he is gualified to comment
as he sees fit.
1 In addition, columnist Grothe may well be
correct in his analysis of the USC basketballers
' —("undeniably the dirtiest team in the PCC
Southern Division").
We would take issue with him, however, on
his request to jump on the referees' backs, tac
tics which he implies might clean up the game
and give the Indians an even break against the
Trojans.
There is nothing we would like better than
to see two BASKETBALL games this weekend,
not a pair of slugfests. But upon closer exami
nation of the overall picture, Grothe's "vocal
antics" do not seem to be the solution.
In the first place, concentrated yelling, curs
ing, and catcalling may only serve to make
martyrs out of the Trojan hoopmen. Two years
ago, we jeered Karl Kraushaar, a husky UCLA
center who had been roundly denounced for
"dirty playing" in more than a few Daily sports
columns.
Yet, as the record proves, Kraushaar got no
- cleaner, nor did he lose his point-making and
: rebounding effectiveness as the season pro
gressed. He ended the year among the top 10
: Southern Division scorers and was even men
: tioned for all-loop honors by the Daily sports
pickers themselves.
: To. jingoistic UCLA supporters, Kraushaar
was a martyr. They blamed any dirty-playing
ideas they had had about him on the adverse
'• jeering, and praised him because he was able
• to take the "riding" and bounce back to score
at least as many points as before.
Stanford, on the other hand, came out a dou
ble loser. Most important, we lost basketball
games; but more than that, we disqualified our
selves from gaining prestige that might other
wise have been ours if we had assumed a
sportsmanlike air instead of adopting the direct
opposite.
Kraushaar may have been poor — likewise

Frank Wickhorst and ]eif Cravath—but it was
not our place to figuratively rip up the stands
and yell for the opposers — as Cal and USC
have done in the past—and all to their own
detriment.
Neither is it within our consciences to sanc
tion "vocal antics" aimed at the referees. The
refs are human beings. When they are being
shouted at, slurred, and denounced, it is hard
to imagine their "unbiased" feelings not be
coming deranged. If we persist in being un
sportsmanlike when our opponents are on the
free throw line, the refs can call a technical
foul against us. But more damaging, the men
in stripes can "hold a grudge" against the par
tisan rabble and take it out in fouls called—or
uncalled, as the case may be —at a crucial time
when the chips are down.
Both referees in Friday's and Saturday's con
tests (Lou Batmale and Ken Fagans) have been
approved by Coach Everett Dean, who is al
lowed a number of "peremptory" challenges
against referees at the beginning of each sea
son. Coach Dean has assured us that they are
honest and capable, and will do the best job
possible, under the circumstances.
It would be wrong to suggest that such men
— even though qualified — are impervious to
continued and uncalled-for jeering from the
audience.
To tie down our arguments, we herewith
publish two statements —one from Basketball
Coach Everett Dean, the other from player
captain Jack O'Sullivan — written to the stu
dents last night:
"We appreciate the fine support we have al
ways received from our rooting section. We
shall need that support more than ever this
weekend. However, it is my hope that the Stan
ford student body will show the same sports
manship toward Southern California players
and the officials that our boys display on the
floor. Please remember that visiting squads
and referees are our guests."

Yesterday's sports page carried a column by
Daily sports reporter Pete Grothe in which fans
were asked to "get on" the referees in this
weekend's basketball tilts with the USC Tro
jans.
To begin with, it is not our purpose on the
editorial side to deny Pete the right to say what
he believes. By virtue of his work on the sports
.staff and his previous coverage of basketball
]at Stanford, we feel he is gualified to comment
as he sees fit.
1 In addition, columnist Grothe may well be
correct in his analysis of the USC basketballers
' —("undeniably the dirtiest team in the PCC
Southern Division").
We would take issue with him, however, on
his request to jump on the referees' backs, tac
tics which he implies might clean up the game
and give the Indians an even break against the
Trojans.
There is nothing we would like better than
to see two BASKETBALL games this weekend,
not a pair of slugfests. But upon closer exami
nation of the overall picture, Grothe's "vocal
antics" do not seem to be the solution.
In the first place, concentrated yelling, curs
ing, and catcalling may only serve to make
martyrs out of the Trojan hoopmen. Two years
ago, we jeered Karl Kraushaar, a husky UCLA
center who had been roundly denounced for
"dirty playing" in more than a few Daily sports
columns.
Yet, as the record proves, Kraushaar got no
- cleaner, nor did he lose his point-making and
: rebounding effectiveness as the season pro
gressed. He ended the year among the top 10
: Southern Division scorers and was even men
: tioned for all-loop honors by the Daily sports
pickers themselves.
: To. jingoistic UCLA supporters, Kraushaar
was a martyr. They blamed any dirty-playing
ideas they had had about him on the adverse
'• jeering, and praised him because he was able
• to take the "riding" and bounce back to score
at least as many points as before.
Stanford, on the other hand, came out a dou
ble loser. Most important, we lost basketball
games; but more than that, we disqualified our
selves from gaining prestige that might other
wise have been ours if we had assumed a
sportsmanlike air instead of adopting the direct
opposite.
Kraushaar may have been poor — likewise

Frank Wickhorst and ]eif Cravath—but it was
not our place to figuratively rip up the stands
and yell for the opposers — as Cal and USC
have done in the past—and all to their own
detriment.
Neither is it within our consciences to sanc
tion "vocal antics" aimed at the referees. The
refs are human beings. When they are being
shouted at, slurred, and denounced, it is hard
to imagine their "unbiased" feelings not be
coming deranged. If we persist in being un
sportsmanlike when our opponents are on the
free throw line, the refs can call a technical
foul against us. But more damaging, the men
in stripes can "hold a grudge" against the par
tisan rabble and take it out in fouls called—or
uncalled, as the case may be —at a crucial time
when the chips are down.
Both referees in Friday's and Saturday's con
tests (Lou Batmale and Ken Fagans) have been
approved by Coach Everett Dean, who is al
lowed a number of "peremptory" challenges
against referees at the beginning of each sea
son. Coach Dean has assured us that they are
honest and capable, and will do the best job
possible, under the circumstances.
It would be wrong to suggest that such men
— even though qualified — are impervious to
continued and uncalled-for jeering from the
audience.
To tie down our arguments, we herewith
publish two statements —one from Basketball
Coach Everett Dean, the other from player
captain Jack O'Sullivan — written to the stu
dents last night:
"We appreciate the fine support we have al
ways received from our rooting section. We
shall need that support more than ever this
weekend. However, it is my hope that the Stan
ford student body will show the same sports
manship toward Southern California players
and the officials that our boys display on the
floor. Please remember that visiting squads
and referees are our guests."
