## 'How to Survive A-Bomb' 
### 
—You can live through an atom bomb raid and you
won't have to have a Geiger counter, protective cloth
ing, or special training to do it—
These words begin "Survival Under Atomic At
tack," a free booklet published by the State Office of
Civil Defense.
Campus Civil Defense Director Alf Brandin lias
requested 4,000 copies of the booklet to be distrib
uted as part of the student faculty orientation pro
gram that is to precede the campus "dry run" alert.
Meanwhile, the State Office has announced it is
distributing the last million of the 3,000,000 copies in
an effort to place one in every California home.
The 31-page pamphlet estimates the dangers of the
bomb, and tells how to minimize injury and property
damage in case of attack.
If a modern A-bomb exploded without warning in
the air over the campus, your calculated chances of
living through the raid would be something like this:
Should you happen to be one of the unlucky
people riyht under the bomb, there is practically no
hope of living through it. In fact, anywhere within
one-half mile of the center of the explosion your
chances of escaping are about one out of 10.
On the other hand, from one-half to one mile away,
you have a 50-50 chance.
From one to one and a half miles away, deaths drop
all the way down to only two or three out of each 100.
Beyond two miles, the explosion will cause prac
tically no deaths at all.
According to the pamphlet, the bomb's main dan
gers result from the blast and burns; injury from
radioactivity has tended to be exaggerated.
To avoid blast injuries, the pamphlet advises to
"fall flat on your face," and bury your face in your
arms.
Flash burns from the A-bomb's light and beat

caused about 30 per cent of the injuries at Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. To those near the center of the burst,
the burns are often fatal. Persons may be seriously
burned more than a mile away, while the heat can
be felt on the bare face and hands at four or five
miles.
To prevent flash burns, try to find shelter where
there is a wall, a high bank, or some other object be
tween you and the bomb, the pamphlet advises.
The booklet takes particular care to knock down,
myths that have grown out of pseudo-scientific fiction
and non-fiction as well as many a rumor inspired
by a mushroom cloud on a movie newsreel screen.
First, the booklet points out, atomic weapons will
not destroy the earth:
Atomic fcombs hold more death and destruction than
man ever before has wrapped in a single package,
but their over-all power still has definite limits. Not
even hydrogen bombs will blow the earth apart or
kill us all by radioactivity.
Second, doubling bomb power does not double de
struction:
Modern A-bombs can cause heavy damage two
miles away, but doubling their power would extend
that range only to two and a half miles. To stretch
the damage range from two to four miles would re
quire a weapon more than eight times the rated
power of present models.
Third, radioactivity is not the bomb's greatest
threat:
Alone, it would account for only a small percentage
of all human deaths and injuries, exccpt in under
ground or underwater explosions.
Fourth, radiation sickness is not always fatal:
In small amounts, radioactivity is seldom harmful.
Even when serious radiation sickness follows a heavy
dosage, there is still a good chance for recovery.
