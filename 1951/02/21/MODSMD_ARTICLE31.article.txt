# Hopscotch Is Part of P.E. Class

Charlie Hokanson, well-mus
cled footballer and trackman,
who can heave the 16-pound
shot 50-some feet, also tosses a
mean hop scotch taw.
Hokanson is one of 97 men and
women enrolled in Physical Educa
tion 157 (Elementary School P.E.),
a course designed to give practical
experience in "playground games
taught on an elementary level," ac
cording to Mrs. Maud L. Knapp, as
sociate professor of education and
physical education. Mrs. Knapp
teaches the course five days a week
in the Women's Gym.
The class, taught principally for
future elementary school teachers,
also includes:
Jesse Cone, football guard; Bob
Griffin, last year's varsity fullback;
former high hurdler Darrell Kreitz;
and Dick Clegg and Bill Herron,
outfielder and catcher respectively
on the Stanford baseball nine.
The class consists of a lecture one
day, games two days a week, and
rhythms—considered by the Physi
cal Education Department the basis
of all physical activity—the remain
ing two.
Do It Yourself
While on the surface the hop
scotch may seem to approach the
ridiculous, the theory is you can't
teach others something you can't do !
yourself.
"Some of the athletes are a little
reluctant to join in the games at !
first," says Mrs. Knapp, "but they
usually find themselves enjoying the j
activities when their early sell'-con
sciousness has been overcome."
The "scotch hoppers" are now at j
the intermediate rhythm stage,
which includes dance steps like
the mazurka, the polka, the Lili
Marlene. In previous rhythm pe- I
riods, class members have simulated j
such animals as seagulls, kangaroos,
frogs, rabbits, and elephants—all to i
music, and with varying individual !
interpretations.
Besides regular 8 o'clock classes,
Mrs. Knapp's assistants hold after
noon lub sections in which students j
get further practical experience by
instructing other class members.
Approximately a third of the class :
wiil teach in elementary schools in )
the area spring quarter, according to ;
Mrs. Knapp.
Though they may resent tempo- '

rary nicknames like "Hopscotch Ho
kanson" and "Kangaroo Clegg," stu
dents in the fclass consider the class
valuable.
Mrs. Knapp tells of a former stu
dent, a burly halfback in his under
graduate days, who told her the
course had proven the most practical
of any he had taken in his physical
education major.
"He had been somewhat skeptical
about the practical benefits of the
course." Mrs. Knapp recalls.
Last summer quarter high school
instructors and even a school super
intendent were enrolled in the class,
in an effort to experience themselves
the physical training their secondary
students had received.
So there must be more to it than
merely "making like a seagull."

Charlie Hokanson will be out
heaving the shot when the spring
track meets roll around. When he
winds up, you can remember he's
also skilled at affecting kangaroo
antics—but for the success of the
track team, let's hope Charlie does
n't.
