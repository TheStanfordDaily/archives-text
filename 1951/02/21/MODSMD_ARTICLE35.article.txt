# 10 TO 7
## Boston Tops Baseballers 
### 
Fourteen men left on base told
most of the story yesterday after
noon as the Stanford baseball squad
lost 10 to 7 to the Boston Brave
Rookies. Three Brave pitchers gave
the Indians many golden opportuni
ties to score as they issued 14 free
passes to first base. However, the
Cards couldn't capitalize, as not one
of their seven runs was driven in by
a base hit.
The Indian nine also fell down in
the fielding department yesterday,
committing five errors.
Sophomore chueker Bob Murphy
looked impressive in Ins first varsity
appearance, giving up one unearned
run and one base hit in the three
innings that he worked. Tony Stel
lar, who worked the last three
frames, walked the first two men to
face him, which led to a pair of runs.
However, he settled down after that,
and didn't allow a Brave past first
base in the final two innings.
Jim Powell, who went in to relieve
Murphy in the fourth frame, ran into
trouble as he hit two batters and
walked a third. Aided by a Card
error and three base hits, the Braves
were able to build up a 6 to 0 lead
by the end of the fourth.
The Cards finally broke into the
scoring column in the sixth inning
as they scored twice on two Brave
errors. Stanford chalked up its five
remaining markers in the seventh as
Brave chucker Lucky Vital ran into
control trouble, walking four men
and hitting another.
