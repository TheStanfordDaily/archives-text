### "DIGGER" ODELL 
Probably the two saddest men in
America today are Nat Holman,
coach of the CCNY cage team, and
Clair Bee, headman at Long Island
University, and quite understand
ably. Their dreams for an entire
year, if not longer, have been shat
tered within the space of a few
hours.
Holman was the first to get it
between the eyes when it was dis
covered a few days back that three
CCNY players, stars of the amaz
ing team that swept to the Na
tional Invitation and NCAA cham
pionships last year for basketball's
first and only "grand slam," were
involved in a basketball "fix."
Named were Ed Roman. Ed War
ner. and A 1 Roth.
A day or so later Bee, who just
recently brought his LIU squad out
West for a few intersectional games,
had his hopes for national recogni
tion clashed to dust. All-American
Sherman White, considered one of
the finest basketball players in the
country, Leroy Smith, and Adolph
Bigos were invloved in this bribe.
It's a crying shame that two such
fine coaches have to be mixed up
in a dirty scandal like this. If
there were ever two men who de
served better treatment, they are
Holman and Cee. As a result of
the filthy business, LIU has can
celed its remaining games for the
season, and CCNY has curtailed
its playing in Madison Square
Garden.
For the sake of the bystanders who
inevitably get caught in the middle
of a mess like this one, if not for the
victims themselves, let's hope this
invasion of college sports by gam
bling interests doesn't continue. .
