# Injured Frosh 'Pretty Good'
## 
### 
The condition of John Stahr, fresh
man who fell from a third-floor win
dow of Encina last week, is "pretty
good," reports Dr. George Houck.
Although he is .suffering from a
compound skull fracture, neither his
brain nor his eyes were injured. His
only discomfort now is that caused
by several broken ribs.
Dr. Houck said that ho will prob
ably be out of the hospital in about
two weeks. Stahr's physician father
returned to Reno yesterday, but his
mother is still st.iying with him.
