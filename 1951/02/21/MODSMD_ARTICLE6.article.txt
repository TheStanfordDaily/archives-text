# Fraternities Can Initiate Before June
## IFC Adopts Rule Because of Draft 
### 
Farm fraternities will be al- !
lowed to initiate pledges next
quarter, thanks to a war-prompt
ed rule passed by Interfrater
nity Council last night.
Under the former rule, fraternities
would have had to wait until fall
quarter. Now the choice of initiation
time rests with each house.
Changes Made
This temporary ruling was part of
a general revision of the Interfrater
nity Code accomplished last night.
In adopting the recommendations of
a four-man committee, the Council
made the following main changes:
1. Allowed initiation spring quar
ter.
2. Allowed informal initiation
practices outside the fraternity
house and grounds if the practices
are approved by a committee of the
IFC in each case.
o. Wiped out the present occu
pancy rule, allowing members on
probation and minus pledges to "live
in" at the discretion of the house
president and resident assistant.
These steps must be approved by
Interfraternity Board of Control be
fore going into effect. However, Dave
Larimer, president of IFC, felt that
approval was virtually certain.
â€¢ Will Work Better"
"The over-all result of the revi
sions is to put more judgment in the
hands of the fraternities," he said.
"I think it will work much better
this way."
The spring quarter initiation rule,
a temporary action, Larimer ex
plained, was passed because it is ex
pected house membership may be
greatly affected by the draft this
summer.
Controversy Settled
The changing of the informal ini
tiation rule clears up a controversy
begun last quarter. At that time IFC
voted to enforce a "dead-letter" rule
forbiding any informal initiation
practices outside fraternity houses
and grounds. Now certain practices
will be allowed if approved by a
committee consisting of the chief
counselor for men, the president of
IFC, and two members of IFC.
Under the foriper occupancy rules,
any member could "live in" if the
house was above the all-men's scho
lastic average. If It was not. no mem
ber on probation or minus pledge
could live in the house.
Now the decision rests with the
president and R.A. of each house.
However, the chief counselor for
men, if he wishes, may object to a
particular member on probation or
minus pledge living in.
