# CIVIL DEFENSE
## Monday Alert Was 'Success' 
### 
The fourth and fifth campus civil
defense units, the command center
and public utilities divisions, were
alerted Monday for test purposes.
Deputy Commander Philip Duffy
started the trial alerts with phone
calls to CD Commander Alf E. Bran
din, who in turn relayed the signal
to division heads.
Division heads and assistants re
ported to the command center—the
Firehouse — where they verbally
went through procedure they would
take in case of attack.
Monday's test alerts as well as the
three last week were mainly per
sonnel checks, Brandin said, adding
that the test alerts are further indoc
trination periods for those serving in
organizational capacities.
Alerts
Monday's yellow alerts were
termed "very successful" by Bran
din, who explained that personnel
responded and were prepared to
perform designated jobs.
Brandin called the public utilities
division alert successful despite the
more numerous personnel involved
and the relative complexity of the
unit, which includes subdivisions of
electricity, plumbing, and transpor
tation.
Silent trial alerts for the two re
maining divisions—liaison and fire—
will take placc today or tomorrow,
according to Brandin, clearing the
way for the co-ordirftited seven-di
vision alert in which students and
faculty will participate.
County Approved
The Stanford business manager
i announced the overall alert was ap
proved by the county Friday.
Division heads will meet with
Brandin Monday to map out and
clarify instructions to students and
faculty as to their role in the mock
| attack alert.
Elaborating on the alert, Brandin
i said it should last approximately 15
! minutes and will include both yel-
I low (preparatory) and red "condi
tions."
Firehouse Whistle
j Both conditions will be included
j to familiarize students with the dif
' ferent whistle signals from the Fire
| house.
Brandin said the campus CD pro
gram is ahead of schedule and the
j overall alert may be held before the
J first week in March when it was
originally scheduled.
