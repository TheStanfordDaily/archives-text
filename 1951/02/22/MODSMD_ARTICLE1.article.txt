## UN Forces Surge Ahead In New Korea Offensive 
### 
TOKYO, Thursday. Feb. 22
(UP) —United Nations troops ex
ploded a new offensive into ac
tion along a 60-mile front in Ko
rea yesterday and surged for
ward six miles or more v/ithout
meeting serious opposition.
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur an
nounced the start of the new offen
sive in a special communique.
Front dispatches, delayed until the
start of the offensive was announced
officially, made it clear the attack
was a major operation extending all
the way across the heart of the pe
ninsula.
The UN offensive jumped off un
der impossible weather conditions
along a front running from the west
central road junction of Yangpyong
to the Pyongchang area in the east.
The Allies caught the Communists
still in pell-mell retreat, throwing
them off balance and paving the way
for further Allied advances toward
the 38th parallel.
Only in western Korea did any
immediate trouble seem in store. An
armored American patrol ran into a
Communist build-up where the Han
and Pukhan rivers join east of Seoul
and was forced back by intense Red
small arms and automatic weapons
fire.
