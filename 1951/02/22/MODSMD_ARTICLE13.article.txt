What is needed at Stanford is
less of the "cafeteria" style of
education, more and better
counseling, and less reaching
down of the tentacles of the pro
fessional schools, said Mr. Lloyd
W. Dinkelspiel, member of the
Board of Trustees.
Mr. Dinkelspiel spoke at the ASSU
Forum on "Education at Stanford: j
An Evaluation," held last night in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club- j
house. Alberta Engvall, member of
the Student-Faculty Education Com
mittee, opened the panel discussion
by presenting what she considered
to be the fundamental issues of edu
cation at Stanford. She criticized the
'"cafeteria" attitude allowed in the
selection of courses.
Snap Courses
Many students just take snap
courses or concentrate on a favor- j
ite subject, she said. Professor John
W. Dodds, head of the special pro
grams in Humanities, felt, however, I
that increased regimentation by the \
University was not the solution.
Carl Stover, chairman of the Forum
Committee and moderator of the dis
cussion, suggested that the problem
might be solved by a more adquate
advising system. He pointed out that
a poll, recently taken to determine
student opinion of Stanford educa- I
tion, showed that a majority were j
dissatisfied with the present advising j
and counseling system.
Student-Faculty Contact
Professor Lawrence Thomas of the
Education Department said that the I
present advising system is an impor
tant means of maintaining student
faculty contact. He therefore dis
agreed with Mr. Dinkelspiel's opin
ion that counseling should be made a
full-time professional job.
In discussing the purpose of edu- I
cation Professor William C. Bark,
head of the Western Civilization i
course, said that understanding is i
what is sought. And in the achieving j
of this understanding the discussion j
method of teaching is of basic im- j
portancc. He stated that our lecture !
system is the result of age-old tradi- j
tion.
