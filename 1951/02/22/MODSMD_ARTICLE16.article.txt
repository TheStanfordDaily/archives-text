# Cards Must Stop Trojans To Climb Out of Cellar
## 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's "scalpless" Indians get another chance at an out-of
the-cellar spot Friday and Saturday nights as they play host to
the Trojans of USC in the Pavilion. Post time lor both games is
8 p.m., and the Card frosh team will play Lowell High School of
San Francisco and Salinas High School at 6 p.m.
Earlier this month the Indians made a trek to the Southland for

an encounter with the Trojans only
to be turned back twice by scores of
65 to 54 and 72 to 45. However, a
basketball has more than one bounce,
and on the local floor it could bouncc
in the Cards' direction.
Deep in reserve strength. Coach
Forrest Twogood will open with
Boh Kolf and Tom Riach at guard
pests. Kolf, a holdover from the
days of Stan Christie and Kill Shar
nifin, is small but potent and han
dles himself well under the hack
hoard. Both he and Riach also have
made names for themselves on of
fense, hitting consistently from 20
and 25 feet out.
Backing these two up will be Ken
Flower, an cx-Menlo JC'er, who can
never be counted out of a ball game.
Against the California Bears last
weekend, Flower captured high
point honors and showed Twogood
that he could be used at any time.
Bruce Bennett and Boh Morton
will probably start at forwards, but
Byron Van Alstyne, Bud Doty, and
Don Lby will he on hand when
duty calls. Every one of these men
is a tough nut to crack and will
bear close watching if they are to
be stopped.
At the center position will be Bob
Boyd and Jerry Pease. Boyd, a six
foot, six-inch, 220-pounder, plays
hard and aggressive under the back
boards and has a deadly eye to match.
Pease, another skyscraper, plays
equally as well and should give the
Cards a rough night or two.
Although they have been losing
rather consistently, the Indians
have some good hall games in them
and appear about "due."
In the first half of the first game
of the Trojan series in Los Angeles,
the Cards showed a decided superior
ity over the Twogooders. If they can
keep up that pace for two consecu
tive halves, they'll come up with the
first win over USC this season.
Coach Everett Dean will keep his
charges on a fast break diet as usual.
Jumpin' Jack O'Sullivan, team cap
tain has been outstanding at his for
ward post in helping the fast break.
On the other side of the court Ed
die Tucker will find himself with the
scoring opportunities on the quick
dash. Tucker has shown greater
drive in the Southland journeys than
he has shown all season and should
be at top form.
At center Jim Ilamstead will find
himself on a triple duty assign
ment. Not only will he be charged
with the jobs of scoring and de

fending his own backboard, but he
will also have to protect himself,
because it gets mighty rough in the
middle of everything and every
body.
Jim Walsh will start at one guard
and cither Bruce Iversen or Gary
Andrews will start at the other post.
Officials for the two games will be
Batmale of San Francisco and Ken
Fagans of Compton JC.
The two preliminary encounters
will be warmups for the double
header to be played against the Cal
frosh next weekend.
Coach Bob Burnett has been drill
ing his men on strict man-to-man
defense this week. He will go with
the regular lineup of Hal Ellis and
Don DeLong at forwards, Dave Ep
person at center, and Olie Suzdaleff
and Don Carlson at guards. The re
serves should spill in later.
