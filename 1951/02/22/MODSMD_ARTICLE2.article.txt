# Draft Dispute
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 â€” Key
members of the House Armed Serv
ices Committee demanded today
that the Defense justify the 18-year
old draft in light of plans to release
some 214.000 National Guardsmen
and reservists.
Rep. Paul J. Kilday, D., Tex., said
the department is repeating the "mis
take" made prior to World War II
when it asked for "a draft law while
refusing to call up reserve compo
nents."
The Army disclosed yesterday that
it hopes to release the Guardsmen
after 24 months' service if the inter
national siutaiton gets no worse. It
also hopes to get by without calling
up "many more" Guardsmen or or
ganized reserve units.
