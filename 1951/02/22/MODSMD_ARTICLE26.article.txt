# Excom Authorizes Committee To Name Rome Meet Delegate
## Publicity Post Is Established 
### 
An official voting delegate
can now be sent by Stanford
University to the Rome World
Peace Conference to be held
April 2-9.
At the request of the Rome Con
gress Committee, a group appointed
by ASSU President Ted Buttner,
Excom voted yesterday afternoon to
give the committee authorization to
select an official delegate.
Excom must approve the com
mittee's choice, and will appro
priate no more than $100 toward
financing the cost of the trip.
Bill Fundcnberg, frosh represen
tative, cast the only vote against the
motion.
The vote marked a quick change
in Excom's position. At the January
meeting Excom voted to authorize
the Rome Congress committee to
send an observer, who would have
had no voting privileges.
However, Gil Jonas, off-campus
representative who has sparked
the forces backing the proposal
since it was first introduced just
after the Christmas holidavs, iold
Excom that the selection com
mittee was handicapped because
of lack of official University back
ing.
Jonas said that the widow of a
University of California professor
had promised to give $100 to start a
memorial fund financing the Rome
trip, if Stanford would definitely
send a delegate.
He added that it would also be
easier to selcct a Stanford represen
tative if Excom would give official
backing. Jonas said he was hopeful
of raising several hundred dollars to
finance the trip.
Excom also voted last night to
set up a Public Relations Co-ort'i
nation Staff, which will co-ordi
nate publicity and other public re
lations projects on campus. Bill
Bethke was appointed Excom rep
resentative on the committee.
Ted Hinshaw, reporting for a
group set up last week to investigate
the idea, said that the members were
unanimous in their approval of the
project.
ASSU President Ted Buttner will
appoint a director to get the project
in operation. Buttner said that a
senior may be chosen even though
he can serve only one quarter, be
cause an experienced man is needed
to establish the program.
Interviews for positions on the
staff and for director will be held
Monday afternoon. The time will
be announced in Monday's Daily.
Excom okayed the appropriation
of $250 of llR's money to go toward
the building of an international
Christian University in Japan.
Harry Rowe, graduate member,
was spokesman for a group of four
who felt that the expenditure was
too high. Rowe felt that a $100 dona
tion would be sufficient.
Tom Griffith, representing lIR,
j told Excom that President Sterling
j is among the many sponsors of the
| idea. Backers are attempting to
; raise $10,000,000 to start the univer
j sity, which will be on a graduate
I level.
