# A 						Difficult Challenge
## 
### 
Tuesday night, IFC took three concrete steps
to revitalize itself and keep up with the chang
ing times. One step in particular was revolu
tionary in scope. It will constitute one of the
toughest challenges the fraternity system has
faced in many a year.
Significantly, the Council revised the pres
ent fraternity occupancy rule and opened fra
ternity doors wider than ever. From now on,
it- mil make no difference whether or not an
active is on probation or a pledge is minus—
both can "live in" provided they have the ap
proval of the fraternity president, and the RA.
As a final check, the Counselor may deny any
such recommendation.
The revision simply means that a great deal
more responsibility is being shifted from the
administration to student-fraternity hands.
If fhe responsibility is ill-used—and men are
allowed to live in houses who will only detract
from fraternity grade averages and prestige —
then it will have been ill-given and the frater
nities will suffer.
That's what we mean by a tough challenge.
Men's Counselor Balch thinks the fraternity
system can and will meet it sguarely.

In a letter today, we are told that "public
pressure aroused by slanted reporting" has re
sulted in more regulation of fraternities at the
University of California.
In fact, the Daily is accused of the same
brand of slanted reporting and singled out as
a contributor to "petty bickering" between
campus fraternity and non-fraternity factions.
We would ask the writers and would-be writ
ers of such letters to take a look at what the
IFC is doing—and all with the co-operation of
the Administration. "Regulation," as it is so
jauntily put, is actually decreasing at Stanford
while the houses are treading on firmer ground
every year.
PRESS and ADMINISTRATION ALIKE stand
behind a balanced University program in
which fraternities have a definite and ever
more solid postion.
Most important, any forecast of "more regu
lation" in the future is out of the question. If
the fraternities face up to their new responsi
bilities—and we think they will—the Adminis
tration's "whip" will continue to get shorter
and shorter.
