### EARL ODELL 
Eridge, anyone?
Beware! The scourge of the age is upon us again!
In a Renewed plague bridge, the rich man's Canasta,
is beginning to take its toll upon the naive, unassum-

ing men on campus. It's even got
me.
It was bad enough when it be
gan in the dim-lit, smoke-filled
room of Branner, Union, and other
women's dorms. How many
times have you poor, lonesome
males phoned up for a date only
to find that "I have a bridge date
at 8. Sorry." Worse still, the gal
U — a J J 1 1-

might have accepted and brought along a deck of
cards—"You've just got to learn how to play."
If the scourge had gone no further, there might have
been hope. We men missed the opportunity of a life
time. Heck, who wants to go out with girls, anyway?
We could have stayed home and studied.
While the gals were busy with their "slams" and
"redoubles" we could have packed the libraries.
We .could have studied hard. We could have raised
the grade average. We could have squeezed the
women out of the top half of the class. We could
Jiave been deferred.
Th? fact is, though, we didn't.
It all started last Sunday as I was lounging around
my girl's dorm (homework on Sunday?). The epitome
ol innocence, I was . . . little suspecting what lay
before me. Well sir, to make a tall story short, before

The Con fession of a Bridge Addict

I could yell "Help!" there I was with a fistful of cards
and a bunch of squealing women trying to see if I had

any honor or something.
It's always been my mother's view that I have honor,
but these gals kept saying that I had only one and a
half honors and that I'd have to wait until somebody
else made a move. Hours later all I could remember
was that someone had "grand slammed" me, "re
doubled" me, and "jumped" my bid. *
The point is, that's all it took. The hug bit me. I
had become a bona fide bridge addict. Now I can't
leave the game alone. I dream about it. The other
night I dreamed I had pulled a hand with 10 spades.
I woke up screaming and spent the rest of the night
trying to figure out how to slough off the other three
cards.
It even worms its way into my studies. I took a
midterm yesterday and one of my answers read like
this: "The chief criticism of the U.S. Government is
that there are too many no trumps. The executive
branch is filled with red hearts, Congress has been
letting too much vulnerable legislation get by, and
the Supreme Court is passing too often."
To those who can still escape, let this be a lesson.
Don't let it happen to you. Don't he a dummy—oops,
there I go again. Stick close to libraries. Don't let
them catch you, and particularly, stay out of wom
en's residences.
I have only one thinq to say in favor of bridge—it
makes for a cheap date?
Fourth for bridge?

women's dorms. How many
times have you poor, lonesome
males phoned up for a date only
to find that "I have a bridge date
at 8. Sorry." Worse still, the gal
U — a J J 1 1-

might have accepted and brought along a deck of
cards—"You've just got to learn how to play."
If the scourge had gone no further, there might have
been hope. We men missed the opportunity of a life
time. Heck, who wants to go out with girls, anyway?
We could have stayed home and studied.
While the gals were busy with their "slams" and
"redoubles" we could have packed the libraries.
We .could have studied hard. We could have raised
the grade average. We could have squeezed the
women out of the top half of the class. We could
Jiave been deferred.
Th? fact is, though, we didn't.
It all started last Sunday as I was lounging around
my girl's dorm (homework on Sunday?). The epitome
ol innocence, I was . . . little suspecting what lay
before me. Well sir, to make a tall story short, before

The Con fession of a Bridge Addict

I could yell "Help!" there I was with a fistful of cards
and a bunch of squealing women trying to see if I had

any honor or something.
It's always been my mother's view that I have honor,
but these gals kept saying that I had only one and a
half honors and that I'd have to wait until somebody
else made a move. Hours later all I could remember
was that someone had "grand slammed" me, "re
doubled" me, and "jumped" my bid. *
The point is, that's all it took. The hug bit me. I
had become a bona fide bridge addict. Now I can't
leave the game alone. I dream about it. The other
night I dreamed I had pulled a hand with 10 spades.
I woke up screaming and spent the rest of the night
trying to figure out how to slough off the other three
cards.
It even worms its way into my studies. I took a
midterm yesterday and one of my answers read like
this: "The chief criticism of the U.S. Government is
that there are too many no trumps. The executive
branch is filled with red hearts, Congress has been
letting too much vulnerable legislation get by, and
the Supreme Court is passing too often."
To those who can still escape, let this be a lesson.
Don't let it happen to you. Don't he a dummy—oops,
there I go again. Stick close to libraries. Don't let
them catch you, and particularly, stay out of wom
en's residences.
I have only one thinq to say in favor of bridge—it
makes for a cheap date?
Fourth for bridge?

Eridge, anyone?
Beware! The scourge of the age is upon us again!
In a Renewed plague bridge, the rich man's Canasta,
is beginning to take its toll upon the naive, unassum-

ing men on campus. It's even got
me.
It was bad enough when it be
gan in the dim-lit, smoke-filled
room of Branner, Union, and other
women's dorms. How many
