# CAMPUS OPINION
## Anti-Fraternity Reporting 
### 
To the Editor:
I'm getting a little tired of the slurs and misaccusa
tions which are so frequently leveled at fraternities in
the press these days. I refer in particular to your
article of Feb. 19, on the Encina student's fall which
labeled this unfortunate accident as "the result of a
fraternity prank." As far as I can see, the student's
fall "resulted" from a lack of common sense (or at
least, surefootedness) on the part of the student, not
to any coercion or "suggestion" by fraternity men. To
blame this accident on fraternity pranksters would
seem to me to be nothing less than an outright slant
ing of the news.
A recent case at Cal, where the accident was due
more to the negligence of the students involved than

to any carelessness by the fraternity men, has re
sulted in more regulation of the fraternities by the
school administration, because of public pressure
aroused by slanted reporting. I frankly think that
such misinforming is not only unfair to the fraternity
system but is a gross violation of good news reporting.
II the press of this school (or indeed, the adminis
tration) wishes to remove fraternities from this cam
pus, okay, but let's be open and aboveboard about it.
Let's face the issue squarely and decide if a fraternity
system is worthwhile or not, and stop this petty bick
ering between the fraternity and non-fraternity fac
tions of the campus which only gives the public a
false impression of university life.
