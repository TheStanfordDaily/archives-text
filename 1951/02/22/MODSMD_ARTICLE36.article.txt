# Hong Kong Scrambles For Wealth, Forsakes Culture
## 
### DAVID WONG 
The British Colony of Hong
Kong, nestling in the southeast
corner of China, means many
things to many people. To the
sailor it means port. To the po
litical refugee it means safety.
To the businessman it means
profit. And to the poor it means
suffering. But to very few
people does Hong Kong mean
home.
Seldom can one find a plate
more beautiful and mere un
wanted than Ilong Hons. The
Chinese looks upon China as his
real home, while the foreigner
looks toward Europe or America.
Both regard Hong Kong as a place
to make a quick fortune and then
leave. Perhaps nowhere in the
world is it more evident that there
is hut one human race — and
everyone in il is running after
money.
The city itself reflects the queer
blending of Western civilization
hall - learned and Chinese culture
half-remembered.
Its activity is accompanied by the
low murmurous roar of men and
machines. Towering buildings look
down upon narrow streets jammed
with buses, trams, lorries, cars, carts,
and rickshaws. Sluggish processions
of over-dressed women and ill-man
nered men block the sidewalks.
With most of its two million in
habitants preoccupied with their
scramblc for wealth or their
struggle for survival, Hong Kong
sees very little in the way of social
or cultural progress.
Though it boasts of a university,
it has no public library, art gallery,
or museum. Education is unavail
able to many thousands of children,
while medical facilities are also lim
ited.
The upper class in Hong Kong is
generally apathetic and Philistine in
outlook. It glories in its dull respec
tability and its tedious orthodoxy.
The midle class is more progres
sive. A couple of years ago a small
group of lawyers, educators, and
journalists banded together to press
for political and social reforms.
Since then they have achieved con
siderable success in stimulating pub

lie interest in the affairs of the com
munity.
'lhe common laborers in Hong
Kong are still in a rather miserable
state, though their lot has im
proved since the war. Trade unions
are gathering strength and their
demands for improved conditions
are beinft partially met.
Recently the problems of Hong
Kong have been further complicated
by a great influx of refugees from
Communist China. Their presence
has made the housing shortage more
acute and has caused food prices to

soar. However, with the Commu
nists at the back door, Hong Kong
appears to many to be only a tempo
rary haven.
Being aware of the danger, the j
Hong Kong government has ordered j
the registration of all British sub
jects for essential services in case o<
emergency. Americans have also
been advised to leave the colony.
Defense lines have been set up
in the New Territories and British
troops are continually out on ma
neuvers. But should the Commu
nists decide to strike, Ilong Kong
cannot be defended for any length
of time.
It is unlikely that the Communists j
will attack in the immediate future. :
however, for oil and other vital ma
terials can still be smuggled to China
through Hong Kong. But one day j
the colony may outlive its useful
ness.

THE HARBOR—The summit of the Peak, where the rich live
like a race of demigods, affords an excellent view of the city of
Victoria, the harbor, the wharfs of Kowloon, and the hills of the
New Territories.
The British Colony of Hong
Kong, nestling in the southeast
corner of China, means many
things to many people. To the
sailor it means port. To the po
litical refugee it means safety.
To the businessman it means
profit. And to the poor it means
suffering. But to very few
people does Hong Kong mean
home.
Seldom can one find a plate
more beautiful and mere un
wanted than Ilong Hons. The
Chinese looks upon China as his
real home, while the foreigner
looks toward Europe or America.
Both regard Hong Kong as a place
to make a quick fortune and then
leave. Perhaps nowhere in the
world is it more evident that there
is hut one human race — and
everyone in il is running after
money.
The city itself reflects the queer
blending of Western civilization
hall - learned and Chinese culture
half-remembered.
Its activity is accompanied by the
low murmurous roar of men and
machines. Towering buildings look
down upon narrow streets jammed
with buses, trams, lorries, cars, carts,
and rickshaws. Sluggish processions
of over-dressed women and ill-man
nered men block the sidewalks.
With most of its two million in
habitants preoccupied with their
scramblc for wealth or their
struggle for survival, Hong Kong
sees very little in the way of social
or cultural progress.
Though it boasts of a university,
it has no public library, art gallery,
or museum. Education is unavail
able to many thousands of children,
while medical facilities are also lim
ited.
The upper class in Hong Kong is
generally apathetic and Philistine in
outlook. It glories in its dull respec
tability and its tedious orthodoxy.
The midle class is more progres
sive. A couple of years ago a small
group of lawyers, educators, and
journalists banded together to press
for political and social reforms.
Since then they have achieved con
siderable success in stimulating pub

lie interest in the affairs of the com
munity.
'lhe common laborers in Hong
Kong are still in a rather miserable
state, though their lot has im
proved since the war. Trade unions
are gathering strength and their
demands for improved conditions
are beinft partially met.
Recently the problems of Hong
Kong have been further complicated
by a great influx of refugees from
Communist China. Their presence
has made the housing shortage more
acute and has caused food prices to

soar. However, with the Commu
nists at the back door, Hong Kong
appears to many to be only a tempo
rary haven.
Being aware of the danger, the j
Hong Kong government has ordered j
the registration of all British sub
jects for essential services in case o<
emergency. Americans have also
been advised to leave the colony.
Defense lines have been set up
in the New Territories and British
troops are continually out on ma
neuvers. But should the Commu
nists decide to strike, Ilong Kong
cannot be defended for any length
of time.
It is unlikely that the Communists j
will attack in the immediate future. :
however, for oil and other vital ma
terials can still be smuggled to China
through Hong Kong. But one day j
the colony may outlive its useful
ness.
