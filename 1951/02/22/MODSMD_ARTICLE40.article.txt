# Indian Nine Seeks First Win
## Chez to Go Against All-Star Moffat Mantecas Saturday 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
"The third time's the charm," they say in baseball, and the
Stanford nine is desperately hoping that the old adage comes true
when they meet the powerful Moffat Mantecas here this Saturday
at 2:30 p.m.
So far, the locals have been rather inept at the plate, and most

of the charming has been done by
the opposition. In their two losing
efforts, Stanford has garnered but
nine hits, which is far from par for
the course. Of this total, outfielder
Chuck Essegian has one-third, and
Art Abrahamson, the man who isn't
supposed to hit, has two. Aside from
this pair, the hitting has been a little
here and a little there, mostly there.
In addition to his hitting, Abra
hamson has been the infield's "'sure
man" so far. Hustling Dick Cole has
also looked good and may give one
of the veterans a run for his money.
The Cards didn't pick any push
overs for the coming encounter, as
the Moffats are more or less regard
ed as the semi-pro Yankees of the
Bay Area.
Their, lineup, reading like a page
out of the Coast League, goes as fol
lows: Brooks Holder (Seals), out
field; Logan Hooper (Seals), out
field; Ted Jennings (Seals), infield;
Leo Thomas (Portland), infield;
Reno De Benedetti (Newark), in
field; Joe Polih (Kansas City), in
field; and Sam Fenech (Oaks),
catcher.
Want more? Well, there's Bud
Gulbourg (Seattle), pitcher; Si Cas
tro (Dodesto), pitcher; and Joe De-
Santi (Bakersfield), another hurler.
Polich, Yankee property, played
most of last year at short with Port
land. Holder was with the Seals in
1950, and has been a veritable Coast
League Columbus, having traveled
from San Francisco to Oakland, to
Hollywood, to Oakland, and back to
San Francisco.
Jennings is one of those baseball
oddities—a "good hit, no field" per
former—but he's not exactly a slouch
at third base either. Thomas can
play any position and is a fine hitter.
Leo had one year up in the majors

with the Browns, but is now back
with Portland. v
And then there's Reno De Bene
detti, turning up like a bad penny as
far as Stanford fans are concerned.
Way back in 1!)47 he was playing for
USF here, and the Stanford rooters
were giving Reno a pretty bad time
for wearing his pants down around
his ankles a la Ted Williams.
So, Reno promptly obliged his
hecklers by becoming the ninth man

in history to hit a home run out of
the Sunken Diamond. But Stanford
fans laughed it off to luck until De
Benedetti came up again and plas
tered a 415-foot triple up against the
boards.
Two years ago the Moffats de
feated Stanford 5 to 2, but last year
the CIBA champs got revenge by
downing the meat packers 10 to 8.
For Stanford, pitchers Joe Chez
and Jim Claypool will attempt the
Frank Buck role against the Moffat
nine, but will definitely need some
help from the hitting department,
which is as overdue as last month's
rent. In fairness to the team, how
ever, it must be realized that the
coaching staff is trying out a lot of
new and inexperienced men in an
effort to find the best starting combo
and available substitutes.


JOE CHEZ—Card rooters are hoping that Joe's big right arm
will again carry the CIBA pennant home to the Farm. Last year
Joe was undefeated in league play. He and lanky Jim Claypool
have been nominated by Assistant Coach Dutch Fehring to try
to quell the powerful Moffatt Mantecas next Saturday in the
Sunken Diamond.
