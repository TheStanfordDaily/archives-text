# Punts and Pitches

### PETE GROTHE 
A word of rebuttal.
Yesterday, Rowland Rebele, the
chief rooster on this paper, wrote an
editorial finding fault with Tues
day's Punts and Pitches. It was a
good editorial, and we agreed with
it in whole. However, we think our
point was misconstrued.
We did not advocate the booing
of the officials. Our point, although
we didn't make it clear, was to
holler, "Watch Boyd on the elbow
ing." if Boyd was committing such
an infraction. Nor did we advo
cate the booing of the Trojans on
the free throw line. There is noth
ing so unsportsmanlike or so un
christian as that. If we called for
booing of the officials and the like,
we should be roundly spanked and
sent to bed without any dinner.
We would, however, like to make
an amendment to our original essay.
We said, "Let's demand a game that
is straight and clean the way a game
ought to be played." That still holds,
but it is evident that jeering the
USCers if they play a dirty game is
poor sportsmanship. Might as well
let the refs take care of the fouls.
The officials call them the way
they see them, and are generally ca
pable, although we stick to our origi
nal statement about the Southland
refs. With the partisan rooters
howling in their ears, they didn't
call all the fouls they should have
against USC (such as Stanford get
ting charged with a timeout when
Walsh had five stitches put in).
Claude Rosenberg, deputy fresh
man coach, pointed out to us yes
terday that the best way to combat
SC fouling is to have the coach speak
to the refs before the game and say,
"Our boys reported that such and
such a player has a habit of hipping,
and would you piease watch that to
night?"
So let's make our rooting posi
tive. Let's YELL when they come
out of the huddle, gang, and let the
refs take care of the thugs from
Troy.
