###

tests, will meet UCLA, the first col
legiate opponent of the season, here
tomorrow. The game will be played
in the stadium at 2:30; admission is

free. On Saturday, the ruggers will
' take on the Olympic Club.
The Bruins, although big and rug
| ged, are not too experienced in the
I game. They have plenty of heft in
i the scrum. Fomer gridders include
Chuck Fraychineaud, 220; Jim
; Thomas, 230; Hal Mitchell, 210; A 1
Raftee, 2015; Dave Owens, 177; Turn
i Bush, 180; and Julie Weisstein, 185.
j The Olympic Club has improved
1 greatly since the very beginning of
the season, when they lost to Cal
6-0 and Stanford 11-8 in non-league
contests. They have an experienced
scrum, Rick Supple, Dave Witter,
and Dave Brown outstanding.
