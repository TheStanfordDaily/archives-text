# False Alarm At Encina
## 
### 
The freshmen at Encina held a
spontaneous fire alarm last night at
7:30 and the confusion was a classic.
Most of the freshmen were certain
that it was routine practice. As one
of the freshmen summed it up,
"What a heck of a time to have a fire
alarm."
The story became different how
ever when the mass spotted the red
fire trucks casting a lurid glow at the
east side of Encina.
"Hey, it is a fire," some of them
shouted, and then the loose mob
converged around the trucks. A
stumbling aggregation of confused
and curious men filed through the
arch and followed one of the trucks
into the court.

It was learned that a false fire
alarm had been turned in and En
cina would have to pay the tra
ditional penalty. The freshmen
streamed back into the wings. One
freshman wrapped in a bathrobe
climbed the stairs muttering inco
herent oaths. He turned to a com
panion and said, "Well, there goes
fifty more bucks."
