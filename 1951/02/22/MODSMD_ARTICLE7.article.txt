# War-Time Restrictions On Food Supply Explained
## 
### 
Full mobilization or all-out war will make necessary decreased
production and consumption of animal products — meat, butter,
and eggs—and increased use of the less palatable foods—grains
and legumes—that are more economical of resources.
This statement was one of the key points in Professor Helen

Farnsworth's analysis of "Food |
Problems in a Period of Mobiliza
tion," given yesterday as the fifth in
the Department of Economics series j
of weekly lectures on mobilization.
Professor Farnsworth, a special
ist in grain problems in Stanford's
Food Research Institute, outlined
some of the waste and inefficiency
caused by rigid World War II grain
and livestock price regulations, i
which by fixing hJfth livestock and
low grain prices encouraged over
production of animal products and
a wasteful draining of grain for
livestock feed that would have had
greater food value if used directly
for human consumption.
Flexibility in stabilization and
price support regulations was one of
Professor Farnsworth's main recom
mendations. She added that "the
basic need—not that I think it will
be done" is to change the attitude of
the major pressure groups, farm, la
bor, and business, that "if sacrifices
arc necessary let them be borne by
others."
As examples of this pampering
of pressure groups she cited the
Defense Production Act of 1950.
which gives stabilization officials
little of the power they would need
to control farm prices and produc- j
tion effectively, and the "sacred
cow of American agriculture," the
parity pricc principle.
She added that full mobilization
would also demand keeping con
sumer morale up by such programs j
of information and education as
were carried on in Great Britain in
the last war, where in spite of strin- !
gent rationing and pricc control |
black markets were almost nonex- i
istcnt.
