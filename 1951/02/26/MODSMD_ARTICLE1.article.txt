## Russia Note Holds Hopes for Talks 
### 
MOSCOW, Feb. 25 (UP) â€”Russia's
new note to Britain was intended to
impress upon the British not only
that the Soviet Union wants to start
talks now to improve relations, but
also that Prime Minister Attlee him
self would be welcome in Moscow,
observers believed today.
In an infrequent step, the Commu
nist party paper Pravda published
the full text of the British diplomatic
note of Feb. 17, charging the Soviet
government with "no real intention
. . . of peaceful collaboration."
Russia offered in the note to enter
into negotiations with Britain for
improving relations between the two
countries, but informed quarters be
lieved the offer was designed in .some
measure for propaganda purposes.
