### 
A Stanford anthropologist, re
cently returned from South America,
will discuss "Themes and Variations
in Brazilian Culture" as the feature
of the Tuesday Evening Series to
morrow night.
Dr. Bernard J. Seigol, who spent a
year doing field woiTc on a rural
community 20 miles from Sao Paulo,
will be heard in a lecture at Memorial
Hall starting at 7:30.
Upon his return from Brazil late
last year, Dr. Siegel reported that
Brazilians are "critically friendly"
toward the United States. They are
giving communism hard going, but
at that time were not excited about
the crisis in Soviet-American rela
tions, he said.
In his studies nf Brazilian rural
communities, he noticed the great
currency of American movies. These,
he said, provide a great social out
let and while many spectators can
not read even the Portuguese sub
titles, let alone understand the Eng
lish, they enjoy them nevertheless.
Dr. Siegel will be introduced by
Professor Richard LaPiere.
