## 
### 
By GEORGE ANDERSON |
Stanford's batting attack fi- i
nallv came to life Saturday after
noon, as ihe Card horsehiders
dumped the powerful semi-pro
Moffat Manteca nine, 6 to 2.
The Indians' nine-hit attack on
Moffatt's two chuckers, Joe De- !
Santi and Cy Castro, was led by !
shortstop Bruce Cameron, who 1
drove in a pair of runs with
three single in five trips to the
plate.
With their attack finally in gear,
the Indians didn't neglect the defen
j sive side of the game for an instant,
as they played errorless ball for the
, second time in three games this year.
Names like Ted Jennings, Brooks
I Holder, Leo Thomas, and Reno De
-1 Benedetti in the Moffatt lineup didn't
have any effect on the Cards' mound
corps as Joe Chez, Jim Claypool, and
Roger Osenbaugh showed that they
were not impressed, by striking out
five batters, and limiting the Mof
i fats to only four hits.
The Cards quickly showed that
1 they had their hitting togs on Satur
j day, when Cameron and Dick Clegß
both singled in the first frame and
i Dick Corzine blasted a 450-foot dou
ble into left center field in the sec
ond.

Stanford scored their first run in
the third inning, when Art Abraham
son led off with a walk, advanced to
second as Chuck Essegian beat out a
slow roller down the third base line,
took third on a passed ball, and came

in as Tom Shaw grounded out.
The Cards pic ked up another tally
in the fourth when Cameron scored
from third as Essegian beat out an
other infield hit. A base on balls and
j a three-base error on the Moffat in

field accounted for another run as
Clegg raced from first base to third
after Moffat first baseman Pete
Longa forgot about the game for a
while as he picked himself off the
turf, where he had been sprawled by
the flying Clcgg.

With the score reading ?> to O.for
Stanford, Dick Cole started the fire
works in the seventh frame by dou
bling to center field. Walks to Hal
Hennacy and Bill Herron loaded the
bags and set the stage for the most
surprising play of the game. Jim
Claypool, who followed Herron to
the plate, laid a perfect bunt down
the third base line to score Cole and
advance the runners.
Cameron followed with his third
hit of the afternoon, a sharp single
over second base, to score Hennacy
and Herron with Stanford's final
runs of the game.
Claypool, who hadn't, allowed
man past first base for three innings
started the ninth by walking the bag. l
full. Sam Fcncch drove in the twr
Moffat runs with a single bctweer
third and shortstop.
Roger Oscnbaugh was rushed ir
from the bull pen, and quickly pu
out the fire by getting the next three
men to fiy out.
The Junior Varsity nine wa:
handed a 7 to 5 defeat by San Mater
JC Thursday afternoon. Saturday

Stanford's batting attack fi- i
nallv came to life Saturday after
noon, as ihe Card horsehiders
dumped the powerful semi-pro
Moffat Manteca nine, 6 to 2.
The Indians' nine-hit attack on
Moffatt's two chuckers, Joe De- !
Santi and Cy Castro, was led by !
shortstop Bruce Cameron, who 1
drove in a pair of runs with
three single in five trips to the
plate.
With their attack finally in gear,
the Indians didn't neglect the defen
j sive side of the game for an instant,
as they played errorless ball for the
, second time in three games this year.
Names like Ted Jennings, Brooks
I Holder, Leo Thomas, and Reno De
-1 Benedetti in the Moffatt lineup didn't
have any effect on the Cards' mound
corps as Joe Chez, Jim Claypool, and
Roger Osenbaugh showed that they
were not impressed, by striking out
five batters, and limiting the Mof
i fats to only four hits.
The Cards quickly showed that
1 they had their hitting togs on Satur
j day, when Cameron and Dick Clegß
both singled in the first frame and
i Dick Corzine blasted a 450-foot dou
ble into left center field in the sec
ond.

Stanford scored their first run in
the third inning, when Art Abraham
son led off with a walk, advanced to
second as Chuck Essegian beat out a
slow roller down the third base line,
took third on a passed ball, and came

in as Tom Shaw grounded out.
The Cards pic ked up another tally
in the fourth when Cameron scored
from third as Essegian beat out an
other infield hit. A base on balls and
j a three-base error on the Moffat in

field accounted for another run as
Clegg raced from first base to third
after Moffat first baseman Pete
Longa forgot about the game for a
while as he picked himself off the
turf, where he had been sprawled by
the flying Clcgg.

With the score reading ?> to O.for
Stanford, Dick Cole started the fire
works in the seventh frame by dou
bling to center field. Walks to Hal
Hennacy and Bill Herron loaded the
bags and set the stage for the most
surprising play of the game. Jim
Claypool, who followed Herron to
the plate, laid a perfect bunt down
the third base line to score Cole and
advance the runners.
Cameron followed with his third
hit of the afternoon, a sharp single
over second base, to score Hennacy
and Herron with Stanford's final
runs of the game.
Claypool, who hadn't, allowed
man past first base for three innings
started the ninth by walking the bag. l
full. Sam Fcncch drove in the twr
Moffat runs with a single bctweer
third and shortstop.
