# Trustee Board Okays Tresidder Union Site
## Long-Range Road, Park Plans Considered at Last Meeting 
### 
The Board of Trustees at its last j
meeting definitely approved the site
of the Tresidder Memorial Union as
the area immediately south of Santa
Teresa Street where Maison Fran
chise is presently located.
The Board also approved the loca
tion of the proposed Alumni House
in the same area. In making these
decisions the Board attempted to co
ordinate the placing of the buildings
with the blueprints of the campus
peripheral road system.
This road system, definitely a long
range proposal, calls for a road to
extend from the corner of Santa Te
resa and Lomita Streets to Arguello
at Lasuen, where Russell House is

| now.
University Business Manager Alf
' Brandin emphasized that none of
these steps were expected to he acted
on in the near future. The main fac
tor in determining whether the Un
ion, the Alumni Building, and the
road will be built next year or 20
years from now is the question of
adequate finances.
Then again, Brandin said, the
Board could change its mind. Also
possible is a change in plans neces
sitated by war conditions.
At any rate, the long-range plans
of the Board's Planning Committee
in charge of Academic Buildings and
Grounds would eventually join the
Tresidder Union with the present
Student Union.
This would mean the closing oft of
at least part of Santa Teresa Street,
from the Post Office to Duena Street.
In Hue time, the Corporation Yard
j and the Firehouse would be moved.
When the road proposed to run in
back of the site is put in, Russell
House will either be moved or razed,
depending upon the condition of the
house when the road is finally com
pleted. Again, Brandin cautioned
Russell residents not to make imme
diate plans for moving, since the en
i tire project will have to await the
necessary money, which may not be
forthcoming for a long time.
The remaining houses between
Russell and the Post Office are
! scheduled to come out later, to be
replaced by a park-like area and a
parking lot. or additional facilities in
connection with the student build
ings.
Sigma Chi, Storey House, Phi
Delta Theta, and a private residence
j arc locat'.'d between Russell and the
Post Office. Their ultimate removal

is even more indefinite than that of
Russell.
The peripheral road project is de
signed to facilitate traffic and pro
vide ample parking on campus in the
future.


DOOMED TO GOâ€”Maison Franqaise, known as The Oaks unitl IV2 years ago, will have to
be moved to make room for the Tresidder Union. The Board of Trustees so decreed at their last
meeting, when they decided the new Union and the Alumni House would be located in the vi
cinity of the French House. The action is not imminent by any means, and will have to await tho
gathering of sufficient funds.
