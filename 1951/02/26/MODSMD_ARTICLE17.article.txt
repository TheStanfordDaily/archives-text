# Six-Room Home Gutted by Flames

A six-room house went up in
smoke yesterday afternoon on Alta

Stanford firemen were called to as
sist Los Altos volunteers to subdue
the flames.

The home, owned by John Garcia,
was a total loss. Garcia was having
the house painted preparatory to
renting it. The cause of the fire was
undetermined, but a neighbor said he
heard an explosion before flames en
veloped the building.
Stanford firemen were called at
5:15. The department's tank truck
was sent as a standby. Smoke from
Garcia's home, which is on a knoll
overlooking the entire valley, could
be seen from miles around.
