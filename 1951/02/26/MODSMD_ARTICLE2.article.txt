ROCKFORD, ll!.â€”Benjamin Fine,
education "editor of the New York
Times, said today the nation's col
leges and universities arc facing "fi
nancial disaster" and may have to
dismiss 25,000 faculty members this
year.
Fine said the defense mobilization
has "demoralized" students who
don't know whether to stay in school
or quit, and collges arc facing a 50
per cent drop in enrollment.
Nearly 50 per cent of olleges and
universities arc operating in the red,
Fine said.
Fine said the dismissal of 25,000
professors would amount to 20 per
ccnt of the entire profession and
would "set back the academic field
of teaching by a century."
