# Toward More Effective Planning
## 
### 
Because of the muddled draft picture, it's dif
ficult to plan ahead this year, difficult for both
the University and students. A story on page 1
of today's Daily, based on information from the
military status cards filled out at winter quar
ter registration, is designed to give students an
idea of what to expect at the end of the school
year when draft boards will reopen student
classifications.
But the conclusion reached from this report
is only an estimate, though a thorough and re
liable one. It is impossible to chart a fool-proof
report, because the entire draft picture will
change when new draft legislation is passed in
March or April.
This very fact that a change in the law is ex
pected soon is the basic reason why all men
will be asked to fill out military status cards
again at spring quarter registration. The reason
is the need for planning.

Planning by students will be made easier.
When the new legislation takes effect, Chief
Counselor for Men Richard L. Balch and others
in the Dean of Student's Office will again com
pile reports letting each man know what to ex
pect and where he stands in relation with other
men. Also, the Dean's office will be strength
ened in its dealings with local boards, as it will
be able to cite definite figures instead of
guesses.
Planning by the University will be made
easier. Officials will be able to estimate how
many students will return next fall, and can
plan accordingly.
The Dean's Office asks only that all men give
their co-operation by filling out the forms care
fully, so that the planning of both students and
school can be on an entirely accurate basis.
