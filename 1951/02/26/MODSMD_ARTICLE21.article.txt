# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Pressure Group of Two 
### 
To the Editor:
Excom is dangerously close to losing faith with the
student body because of the actions of two of its
members who owe their allegiance elsewhere. At the
continued insistence of these two members, Excom
lias been unwillingly led to participation in a highly
doubtful Rome Congress. After publicly voting it
down in January, they now have capriciously re
versed themselves.
It seems that Excom does not have the guts to re
sist the parliamentary maneuvers of two of its mem
bers, who are representing outside groups, Gil Jonas
and Dick O'Connell (president of the Student Federal
ists). This pressure group has imposed its will upon
an unwilling Stanford University. The student body
is not even allowed to approve or disapprove the Ex
com action committing our University to World Fed
eralism. The BIG TWO pressure group is even hand
picking the delegate.
Excom has an unusual grant of power from the Uni
versity, including policy decisions and the manipula
tion of thousands of dollars of tuition money. In order
to preserve the integrity of Excom, the students should
join in demanding of their Excom delegates that the
whole Rome Congress question be referred to the Stu
dent Body. Unlike Mr. Jonas and Mr. O'Connell, we
believe in the ability of the students to do their own
thinking.
