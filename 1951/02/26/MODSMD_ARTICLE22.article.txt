# Fork in the Road

To the Editor:
THIS IS THE FORK IN THE ROAD. Are we get
ting forked? Why isn't Excom abiding by its previous
logical decision concerning the Rome Congress dele
pate?
These are not times to be allying ourselves through
quasi-representation and political boondoggling in
Excom with factions which dream great dreams in
these days of imperative practicality.
The prestige of a great university across the Bay

has already been alarmingly lowered through its stu
dents' affiliations with groups supporting Marxian
poppycock and pipedreams. To date the name of Stan
ford has fortunately not been identified with a bunch
of political crackpots and leftist tendencies.
I do not want the name of Stanford associated with
or represented in such an anachronistic convention as
the Rome Congress. I personally do not wish my ideo
logical Hag dragged into such philosophically unsound
muck.
