# Smoke Screen
## 
### 
To the Editor:
What is this organization called Excom? Does it
represent the students or a small, active clique? An
official delegate to the World Federalism Congress
was voted down after a fair and public airing. One
month later under a smoke screen of verbal hodge
podge a delegate is approved in a "special afternoon
session."
This seems like un-Stanfordian activity. World
Federalism was not a campaign issue when the Excom
representatives were elected. The student body should
be allowed to vote on the resolution: I want to be
represented as a World Federalist.
