# Clean Up at Home
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In regard to Pete Grothe's attitude in Monday's pa
per. I would like to point out that Stanford has taken
a tight hold on the foul leadership by being first in
the number of fouls committed in the league. Of
course, our boys are "nice" when they hack, knee, or
elbow a Trojan, but there we are at the top of the list.
Pete, let's clean up at home first and then start howl
ing at our naughty foes.
