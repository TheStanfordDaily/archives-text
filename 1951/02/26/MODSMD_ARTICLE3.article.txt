# Communist Retreat

EIGHTH ARMY HEADQUAR
TERS. Korea—The Korean war went
into its ninth month today with
United Nations forces driving north
once more in an offensive whose goal
is still uncertain.
The new attack so far has only
two objectives — to kill as many
Communists as possible, and to kill
time until the United Nations de
cides what to do about Communist
China.
Communist forces dropped back
into a wilderness area of central Ko
rea today and Allied officers said
they had cased out of an intended
trap and were regrouping in some
areas for a counterattack.
