# Atomic Energy Research Spreads Around World
## 
### 
The Atomic Age, born on Dec. 2, 1942, in a cramped and impro
vised lab beneath an athletic stadium in Chicago, has now pushed
its frontier outposts to the farthest corners of the world.
The actual number of atomic installations there are today is
veiled in national secrecies. But even the factory-cities and lab-

oratories openly identified as atomic I
energy centers comprise an impres
sive list. In the United States alone
there are 1,300 government and pri
vately owned laboratories, industrial
plants, colleges, and research insti
tutions.
All over the world more nations
are delving into the mystery of the
atom and the fear of an atomic war
could soon be realized.
Communist China is the latest to
announce the establishment of an
atomic research institute—in Pei
ping.
In Canada two nuclear reactors
are in operation at Chalk River, On
tario.
The most famous of England's sev
en atomic centers is at Harwell,
Berkshire, near Oxford, where
"Gleep" and "Bepe"—as the atomic
research piles have been nicknamed
—have been in operation for three
years. 1 ' '' •
France began atomic experiments
in 1948 at Fort de Chatillon in the
Paris suburbs. Atomic centers have
also been established in Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, and Hungary.
Belgium has an atomic labora
tory at Belgium University and
scientists of Western Germany
have applied for permission to set
up their own atomic research de
partment. India too has an Atomic
Energy Commission and plans for
a "factory for atomic research" in
Bombay.
In Argentina, Australia, Japan,
Mexico, New Zealand, and Poland
discoveries of uranium deposits have
brought reports of accelerated atomic
research.
The Iron Curtain of Russia ne
cessitates only speculation on the
extent of their atomic operations.
A decade ago it was known that
laboratories in Moscow and Len
ingrad were producing the most
powerful cyclotrons in Europe.
There is only speculation as to the
site of Russia's "atomgrad," but the
Kremlin's propaganda claims that it
"moved a mountain" with atomic
energy. Because vast amounts of
energy are needed to process ura
nium or plutonium, a suspect area
lies behind the ramparts of Central
Asia, where a big hydroelectric plant
has been built.
Another power project lies on the
western slope of the Urals where
low-grade uranium is known to ex
ist.
In the Siberian wilderness, it has
been guessed, was the site of the
atomic explosion which President
Truman reported to the world on
Sept. 23, 1949. Here was an exper
iment which made the awesome
force of nuclear energy an even
more disturbing factor in world
I affairs.
