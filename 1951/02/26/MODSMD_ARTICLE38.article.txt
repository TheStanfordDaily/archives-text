# Frosh Score Again; Meet Braves Today
## 
### 
The dreadful monotony of it all.
Stanford's freshman basketballers
ho-hummed their way to two effort
less victories last weekend as they
scuttled Lowell High School of San
Francisco 69 to 44 on Friday, and
then prevailed over Salinas High 66
to 46 on Saturday.
The twin killing marked the six
teenth time in 18 trips out of the
barn that the Papooses have been on
the long end of the score.
Lowell jumped to a 1 to 0 lead,
but Stanford's Olie Suzdaleff tanked
a jump shot, and the Papooses were
never headed. The Card babes held a
29 to 16 advantage at half-time and
a 54 to 32 lead at the end of the
third quarter.
Guard Don Carlson, he of the
Greek god body, was instrumental
in turning back his alma mater. He
was high point man with 16. Suzda
leff was next in line with 13 digits.
A friendly spirit prevailed during
the game, probably because Lowell
is the breeding ground for so many
Stanford cagersâ€”Carlson, Bill Ste
venson, Fritz Fenster, and Dan Wil
bur, to name a few.

Stanford met and beat a high
class prep team in Salinas on Sat
urday. The kids from the lettuce
belt, led by 6-foot 6-inch Russ Law
ler at center, turned in a victory over
the Cal frosh recently.
The Saturday night tiff, however,
was practically a carbon copy of the
Lowell game. Stanford didn't take a
deep breath in winning, and the re
serves continued where the regulars
lelt off. Center Dave Epperson was
high with 18, followed by Carlson
with 14.
The frosh cage season comes to a
climax this weekend when the year
lings meet Cal in a pair of games.
This afternoon t!:e frosh will seek
to avenge an earlier defeat when
they tangle with the Braves in the
Pavilion at 4 o'clock. In the first
family quarrel between the two
Farm teams the Braves squeaked by
the frosh 61 to 60.
The yearlings under the coaching
of Bob Burnett have lost only one
game to outside competition, that
being a one-point loss to the USF
frosh.
