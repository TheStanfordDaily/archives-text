# Korean War Enters Ninth Month as Allied Troops Move On
## 
### 
It was eight months ago yesterday
that a strong North Korean Commu
nist army broke across the ''Bth par
allel and the tragic, push-you-pull
me war in Korea got under way.
The war has been eight months of
attacks and counterattacks, victories
and defeats.
And eight months (if uncertainty,
scaled from the basic question of
peace or war, to the less world
shaking query of "Will I be back at
Stanford next fall?"
What kind of a war has it been?
llow has it affected the Stanford stu
dent? A glance at Daily files by
monthly intervals gives you some
idea.

June 25— Communist armies of
North Korea pour across 38th paral
lel. Two days later, Presioent Tru
man makes dramatic decision to send
U.S. military aid to South Korea.
UN voices approval.
July 25—UN forces fall back all
along front. Senator Tydings of
Maryland suys only few men will be
drafted if war is confined to Korea.
Three days later draft call of 100,000
issued.
Aug. 25—UN forces stiffen resist
ance, but still fall back. Revised
military plans sec end of war by
spring, 1951.
Sept. 25—UN forces now on offen
sive, retake Seoul. High enrollment
here indicates few men drafted.
Oct. 25 —UN troops roll on past
Pyongyang, North Korean capital.
Nov. 25—UN troops, spurred on
with "Home by Christmas" declara
tion by Gen. Mac Arthur, near Man
churian border. Four days later,
Chinese Red troops, inactive until
now, stream across Yalu River and
rout UN offensive —"a new war,"
says Mac Arthur.
Dec. 25 — A bleak Christmas, as
UN falls back everywhere. Trapped
Marine regiment fights toward coast
and safety. Some Stanford students
enlist, feeling that draft is inevitable.
Jan. 25 — U.S. Eighth Army says
UN holds initiative for first time
since end of November. Congress
works on 18-year-old draft bill.
Feb. 25 —UN troops push new
counteroffensive, gain ground against
stiff resistance. College men wait for
new draft legislation, due from Con
gress.


POUR IT ON—While one GI observes the results, his buddies pour .50 caliber machniegun fire
at Chinese Communists dug in on a hillside along the Han River. The men belong to Company
C, 19th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Division. —Acme Telephoto


WHERE ARE THE INDIANS?—Looking very m uch like a covered-wacjon caravan circling for
defense against Indian attack, these UN tanks form a battle circle awaiting orders to attack the
Chinese Communists during the latest Allied drive in Korea, just like the unmechanized cavalry
of past years. —Acme Telephoto

It was eight months ago yesterday
that a strong North Korean Commu
nist army broke across the ''Bth par
allel and the tragic, push-you-pull
me war in Korea got under way.
The war has been eight months of
attacks and counterattacks, victories
and defeats.
And eight months (if uncertainty,
scaled from the basic question of
peace or war, to the less world
shaking query of "Will I be back at
Stanford next fall?"
What kind of a war has it been?
llow has it affected the Stanford stu
dent? A glance at Daily files by
monthly intervals gives you some
idea.

June 25— Communist armies of
North Korea pour across 38th paral
lel. Two days later, Presioent Tru
man makes dramatic decision to send
U.S. military aid to South Korea.
UN voices approval.
July 25—UN forces fall back all
along front. Senator Tydings of
Maryland suys only few men will be
drafted if war is confined to Korea.
Three days later draft call of 100,000
issued.
Aug. 25—UN forces stiffen resist
ance, but still fall back. Revised
military plans sec end of war by
spring, 1951.
Sept. 25—UN forces now on offen
sive, retake Seoul. High enrollment
here indicates few men drafted.
Oct. 25 —UN troops roll on past
Pyongyang, North Korean capital.
Nov. 25—UN troops, spurred on
with "Home by Christmas" declara
tion by Gen. Mac Arthur, near Man
churian border. Four days later,
Chinese Red troops, inactive until
now, stream across Yalu River and
rout UN offensive —"a new war,"
says Mac Arthur.
Dec. 25 — A bleak Christmas, as
UN falls back everywhere. Trapped
Marine regiment fights toward coast
and safety. Some Stanford students
enlist, feeling that draft is inevitable.
