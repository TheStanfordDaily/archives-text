### 
WASHINGTON â€” Russia is still
getting critical materials and ma
chinery from the non - Communist
world in spite of all American efforts
to halt the traffic, a survey showed
today.
Rubber, tin, wool, copper, cotton,
and all kinds of industrial machinery
and tools appear to be the main tar
gets for the Russian buyers, and the
trade figures list Great Britain and
Belgium as their principal suppliers,
in that order.
