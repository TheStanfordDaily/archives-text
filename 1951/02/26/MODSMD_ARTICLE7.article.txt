# Cagers Win One, Drop One to USC
## Sully Sparks First Attack; Tucker Sets Scoring Record 
### EARL ODELL 
El Trojan was mighty lucky to go home with half of his scalp!
With two seconds remaining Friday night, Eddie Tucker calmly
stood at the free throw line and pumped through two points to
defeat USC, 73 to 71. Saturday night Tucker went wild, scoring
31 points, breaking the Stanford individual scoring mark set by

Hank Luisetti, but to no avail. With ,
seven minutes to go, Trojan forward I
Bruce Bennett drove in to break a J
58 to 58 tic and Troy went on to win
68 to 65.
It was undoubtedly Captain Jump- i
in' Jack O'Sullivan's night Friday as
he hit for 10 field goals and four free
throws for a total of 24 points. Sully
I lived up to his name that night,
' dumping jump shots from every
conccivable angle.
New Combination
Coach Everett Dean started a new '
combination against the men of Troy
: in an attempt to get more height un- :
der the bucket. He placed Jim Ram
stead and Bill Stevenson around the
foul circle and Ed Tucker, Jack
O'.Sullivan, and Jim Walsh out
deep. The offense consisted of feed
ing "Rammer" or "Steve" and fol- i
lowing around the corners.
Dean's plan worked beautifully, !
| with the Indians hitting from cither
corner and Ramstead working from
under the bucket to the extent of 20
points.
The first, half was a touch-and-go
battle right up to the gun marking
intermission time. Although the
southlanders were never ahead by
more than two points, the Indians
| as well as the local rooters felt the
! pressure. No one knew exactly when
j the Trojans might explode.
Sully Breaks Loose
The USCers never did explode,
| however; instead it was the Cards
j themselves. Opening up the second
| half with the Cards leading by a
j close margin of one point, 44 to 43,
the Indians went berserk. Paul John- j
son pushed one through, followed
quickly by short push shots by
Tucker and Gary Andrews. Then
O'Sullivan, working the fast break
with all the speed that has made him
one of the most respected and feared
' men on the Card quintet, tanked
three field goals in rapid-fire order
to put the Indians out in front, 56
to 45.
The Trojans were not out of the
j picture, though, and with forwards
' Bob Morton and Ken Flower leading
} the way, whittled down the lead.
! With three and a half minutes to go,
j P'lower evened up the score at 60 to
! 60 with an underhand lav-in. The
j Indians followed in quick fashion
j with a hook shot by Ramstead and
then Flower meshed a 35-footcr for
| a 71 to 71 score.
Two Charity Tosses
Time was running out when USC
guard Don Underwood fouled Tuck
er under the bucket as Eddie went
up for a lay-in. Coach Forrest Two
i good of the Figucroans, who had
been jumping up as much as O'Sulli
van all night, quickly hopped over to
the timekeeper to protest that the
game was over but discovered that
; two seconds yet remained. About the
j only cool head in the Pavilion in
I ' those seconds was Tucker watching

his two free throws swish through
for the winning points.
Twogood remarked to Dean after
the game that his boys "played their
best game of the season." Dean, in
turn, stated of his players, *'I was
very proud of their performance
against USC."
Saturday night it looked like a
repeat performance, and if it had
been, it would have been the first
time Stanford had taken two straight
from USC since 1047.
Troy Creeps Up
The Indians, with Tucker at his
best, moved out to ft 14 to 8 lead

Morton (12) and Bobby Kolf (7).
