# 'No Regrets,' Say Skiers, Nursing Injuries
## 
### HOLBROOK TETER 
Sunburnt faces, black - and - blue
bodies, and a few disabled legs and
kneecaps marked an estimated 400
ski enthusiasts as they trekked back
to campus yesterday and Sunday
from the snow regions.
And it had been powder! Powder
snow from the Donner-Tahoe area
to Dodge Ridge, Yosemitc, and Se
quoia National Park. Comments
ranged from "Tremendous" and"The
best I've ever skied in," to "It's not
as soft as it looks, ask me!" and
"Johnnie, if you put any more down
my neck, you won't live long."
Several serious injuries have been
reported. Mort McDonald, senior at
7'oyon, fell on Signal Hill at Donner
Summit. His ski pole went four
inches* into his calf. He pulled it
out himself, and was then transport
ed by toboggan to the Sierra Ski
Lodge.
At the Palo Alto Hospital is Mor
gan Baird, Chi Psi, who broke his leg
while taking a lesson at Squaw Val
ley. Baird saw the bright side of the
misfortune, saying, "At least I'm 4-F
for eight months.
Ilse Sternburg, a Branner sopho
more, broke her ankle at Donner
Summit.
Carolyn Tcren's problem was of a
different nature. Just before she was
to enter the Class B slalom races at
Yosemitc, the Lagunita sophomore
received her Class A rating. This
rating, which meant she was ineli
gible for the race, is a qualification
for competition in the Olympics.
Later on Miss Tcren sprained her
ankle.
There was also a sprinkling of
sprained arms and legs. Of ten
KA's who skied at Strawberry "at
least five came down with wrenched

knees," said Bob Magee, sophomore,
as he hobbled across Quad.
Most skiing groups, however, re
ported good skiing, good fun. and no
mishaps. The .skiing team was at

Squaw Valley, getting advice from
Etnile Allais. Another group, in
cluding Nan Henderson and Bob
Finkle from Stanford, went touring
in Sequoia National Park. They

climbcd a peak over 11,000 feet high
The general reaction to the four
day weekend is that it was "great,"
and most of the skiers would like tr
"get out and do it all over again."
