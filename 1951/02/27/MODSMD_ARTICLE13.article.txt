## Daily Bruin Staff Quits In Protest 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
The Daily UCLA Bruin died
last Friday — after it had been
beaten, compromised, and
kicked around by the Student
Executive Council for two
months.
Martin Browcr, who had been ap
pointed editor by the Council early
Wednesday evening, resigned Fri
day with most of his staff when the
SEC appointed a non-staff member
to the position of feature editor.
The SEC, which wanted to make
sure the new Bruin editor was an
"unbiased" nonentity, voted down
Jerry Schlapik and Brower, the
Bruin's first and second choice for
editor, last semester. Schlapik's
name was sent to the Council and
approved by Publications Council
three times—and voted down for no
stated reason by the Council three
times.
After several midnight sessions,
Brower was finally chosen manag
ing editor. Schlapik drifted along
as acting editor this semester until
last Wednesday when the SEC
finally voted Brower in. At the
same time the SEC voted down
both the Bruin choices for manag
ing editor.
The Bruin staff put up a qualified
six -.semester candidate for feature
editor, Irv Shimer. The SEC passed
him over in favor of Rex Rexrode,
who has never worked on the Bruin,
and Brower resigned.
In his final editorial Martin Brow
er wrote of the compromises it has
taken to keep the Bruin alive for so
many years—of the constant refusals
of the SEC to accept qualified candi
dates, people with minds of their
own. Browcr wrote of his own de
cision too:
"... I publicly resigned the edi
torship with the statement that over
three years of working 30 hours per
week on the Bruin were shot. It was
here, at this instant, that the entire
staff was unified. As I walked from
the council table they crowded
around me, hugging me, shaking my
hands and crying. We were at this
moment once again the staff we had
been three years ago : — mostly new
faces, but the same spirit, the same
principles. . . .
"Originally I intended to leave
everything alone after my resig
nation and try to study for the first
time in years . But not now. Now
we arc going to appeal to the cam
pus, to their sense of fair play. . . .
Many men have experimented
with bringing the dead back to life.
Maybe we can perform this mir
acle with The Daily Bruin."
Until further notice the UCLA
Student Executive Council is pub
lishing and editing the Daily Bruin.
