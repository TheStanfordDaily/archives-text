### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2fi â€” The
government tonight banned or lim
ited the use of natural rubber in
more than 40,000 civilian products,
effective March 1. No natural rub
ber will be allowed in passenger car
and light truck tire tubes.
The order, which will be issued
formally by the National Production
Authority in a day or two, covered
nearly every civilian rubber item
from industrial belts to falsies. The
use of natural rubber was banned in
some and limited severely in others.
Sporting goods were affected.
Officials said the order will not
mean any cut in overall production
of rubber goods, since synthetic rub
ber may be used wherever the use of
natural rubber is banned.
