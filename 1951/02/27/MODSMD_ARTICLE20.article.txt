# Nevada Approval Makes 22nd Amendment Law
## Nation's Presidents Now Limited to Two Terms 
### 
CARSON CITY. Nev., Feb. 26 (UP)—The State of Nevada, 36th
to be admitted to the Union, today passed the 36th ratification of
the Constitutional Amendment limiting Presidents to two terms in
office, automatically making the amendment part of the Constitu
tion.
The Nevada Senate voted 16 to one to pass the resolution rati-

fying the 22nd Amendment at 4:30
p.m. (PST), 30 minutes after the
State of Utah became the 35th to ap
prove the amendment.
Ratification by the two states left
President Truman as the final man
who can aspire to more than two
terms in the nation's largest job.
The new Constitutional Amend
ment. which was originated by the
Republican Party, was passed de
spite earlier Democratic opposition
in the Utah Senate and the Ne
vada Assembly.
The amendment stipulates that
hereafter no person can be elected to
more than two full terms as Presi
dent of the United States. It also
states that any President who serves
more than two years of a predeces
sor's unexpired term, as did Mr.
Truman, can only run once in his
own right.

President Truman is exempted,
however, from limitations of the new
amendment, as he was in office when
the proposition was first submitted to
the states for ratification.
Mr. Truman is under no restric
tion against running in 1952 again
for the presidential ollice and could
possibly run as many times as he
wishes, even though he served
mere than two years of President
Roosevelt's fourth term.
The Nevada Senate had waited
anxiously for more than three hours
for notification of Utah's passage.
When informed by the United Press
of the Utah ratification by a vote of
14 to eight, the Nevada Senate im
mediately went into session and ap
proved by a vote of 16 to one tlx;
limiting amendment.
Passage of the resolution in Utah's
Democratic-controlled upper house
by a 14 to eight margin was assured
with the support of the traditionally
conservative Democratic bloc. The
Utah house, split 30-30, passed the
resolution with a leeway of only
eight votes—3o Republicans and eight
conservative Democrats.
Until the last day or so, ratifica
tion of the 22nd Amendment had
been regarded by many Nevada
lawmakers as part of a state polit
ical issue. The Democrats, who
hold a slim majority in the assem
bly, at one time caucused and
pledged all party members to vote
against ratification.
However, after an appeal from the
floor by Don Crawford, a Democratic
rancher, that "this matter is too vital
for partisan politics," the Democrats
held another caucus today and re
leased the pledges.

anxiously for more than three hours
for notification of Utah's passage.
When informed by the United Press
of the Utah ratification by a vote of
14 to eight, the Nevada Senate im
mediately went into session and ap
proved by a vote of 16 to one tlx;
limiting amendment.
Passage of the resolution in Utah's
Democratic-controlled upper house
by a 14 to eight margin was assured
with the support of the traditionally
conservative Democratic bloc. The
Utah house, split 30-30, passed the
resolution with a leeway of only
eight votes—3o Republicans and eight
conservative Democrats.
Until the last day or so, ratifica
tion of the 22nd Amendment had
been regarded by many Nevada
lawmakers as part of a state polit
ical issue. The Democrats, who
hold a slim majority in the assem
bly, at one time caucused and
pledged all party members to vote
against ratification.
However, after an appeal from the
floor by Don Crawford, a Democratic
rancher, that "this matter is too vital
for partisan politics," the Democrats
held another caucus today and re
leased the pledges.
CARSON CITY. Nev., Feb. 26 (UP)—The State of Nevada, 36th
to be admitted to the Union, today passed the 36th ratification of
the Constitutional Amendment limiting Presidents to two terms in
office, automatically making the amendment part of the Constitu
tion.
The Nevada Senate voted 16 to one to pass the resolution rati-

fying the 22nd Amendment at 4:30
p.m. (PST), 30 minutes after the
State of Utah became the 35th to ap
prove the amendment.
Ratification by the two states left
President Truman as the final man
who can aspire to more than two
terms in the nation's largest job.
The new Constitutional Amend
ment. which was originated by the
Republican Party, was passed de
spite earlier Democratic opposition
in the Utah Senate and the Ne
vada Assembly.
The amendment stipulates that
hereafter no person can be elected to
more than two full terms as Presi
dent of the United States. It also
states that any President who serves
more than two years of a predeces
sor's unexpired term, as did Mr.
Truman, can only run once in his
own right.

President Truman is exempted,
however, from limitations of the new
amendment, as he was in office when
the proposition was first submitted to
the states for ratification.
Mr. Truman is under no restric
tion against running in 1952 again
for the presidential ollice and could
possibly run as many times as he
wishes, even though he served
mere than two years of President
Roosevelt's fourth term.
