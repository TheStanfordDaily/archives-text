Tarnished or shiny, every penny lIR hopes
to collect tomorrow night from the Nelson
Eddy benefit concert will mean tangible re
sults in a country that needs —and wants —an
education in democracy and democratic prin
ciples.
Politics, the UN, and special envoys don't
seem to be the answer in India. On the other
hand, as many of our exchangees from India
tell us time and again, food, clothing, books,
and American know-how can work wonders.
The Institute of International Relations is
steering the latter course. It is making a con
certed effort to pour an estimated $1,500 into
the University at New Delhi and provide hun
dreds of displaced Indian students with better
living conditions, more food, and more books.
It is a tangible course and one well worth
the purchase price of a ticket to the Nelson
Eddy benefit.
There are other reasons why we should sup
port such a concert. If we look at the lIR and
what it is doing along international educational
lines, we find it aiding a total of nine universi
ties throughout the world. Every year, some
120 campus lIR workers help send tons of
clothes, books, and material to needy students
at these institutions.

By staging a top flight concert at price levels
within the reach of most of us, the Institute is
setting an example that many student groups
would do well to follow. In essence, the lIR
is giving its own version of the Student-Faculty
Talent Show—a vehicle intended to entertain
as well as realize a profit for a worthwhile
cause.
However, concert or no concert, we would
sincerely ask every Stanford student to con
tribute to international understanding in a way
we feel is most likely to get results.
To date, the lIR has barely broken even on
expenses as 1,200 tickets have passed over the
counter. From now on, total sales receipts will
go straight to New Delhi.
If the $1,500 goal is to be reached, the plaud
its will have to go to you. To hit the mark, the
lIR has placed its hopes on the Fall Relief
Drive, which netted $500, and the Eddy con
cert. There are still $1,000 big dollars to go.
Furthermore, if you should happen to go to
morrow night, we guarantee you'll receive an
earful of fine music, while giving a fistful of
pennies that will be translated into the most
tangible kind of action any university could
undertake.

The Institute of International Relations is
steering the latter course. It is making a con
certed effort to pour an estimated $1,500 into
the University at New Delhi and provide hun
dreds of displaced Indian students with better
living conditions, more food, and more books.
It is a tangible course and one well worth
the purchase price of a ticket to the Nelson
Eddy benefit.
There are other reasons why we should sup
port such a concert. If we look at the lIR and
what it is doing along international educational
lines, we find it aiding a total of nine universi
ties throughout the world. Every year, some
120 campus lIR workers help send tons of
clothes, books, and material to needy students
at these institutions.

By staging a top flight concert at price levels
within the reach of most of us, the Institute is
setting an example that many student groups
would do well to follow. In essence, the lIR
is giving its own version of the Student-Faculty
Talent Show—a vehicle intended to entertain
as well as realize a profit for a worthwhile
cause.
However, concert or no concert, we would
sincerely ask every Stanford student to con
tribute to international understanding in a way
we feel is most likely to get results.
To date, the lIR has barely broken even on
expenses as 1,200 tickets have passed over the
counter. From now on, total sales receipts will
go straight to New Delhi.
If the $1,500 goal is to be reached, the plaud
its will have to go to you. To hit the mark, the
lIR has placed its hopes on the Fall Relief
Drive, which netted $500, and the Eddy con
cert. There are still $1,000 big dollars to go.
Furthermore, if you should happen to go to
morrow night, we guarantee you'll receive an
earful of fine music, while giving a fistful of
pennies that will be translated into the most
tangible kind of action any university could
undertake.
Tarnished or shiny, every penny lIR hopes
to collect tomorrow night from the Nelson
Eddy benefit concert will mean tangible re
sults in a country that needs —and wants —an
education in democracy and democratic prin
ciples.
Politics, the UN, and special envoys don't
seem to be the answer in India. On the other
hand, as many of our exchangees from India
tell us time and again, food, clothing, books,
and American know-how can work wonders.
