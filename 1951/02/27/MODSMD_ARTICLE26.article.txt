Tii the Editor:
We feel it is time for reform at Stanford. There is in
existence on this campus, thinly disguised as the Uni
versity Library, a social group maliciously designed
to drive from their happy home the bats, mice, li
brarians, and occasional students who avail themselves
of what few facilities this building houses.
This malicious group is composed of freshmen,
sophomores, and other assorted adolescents who
.shriek, call, smoke, chatter, buzz, hum. and laugh
shrilly—their horrible cries penetrating sometimes as
far as the Periodical Room from the lobby they in
habit. It is time that Someone in Authority sweep out
these vermin.
S. H. ROBINSON
BILL BRYAN
(Readers Robinson and Bryan undoubtedly have

How We Use Our Library

a number of valid objections. However, Library of
ficials report they have received practically 110 ob
jections to "malicious social groups" disrupting
peace and quiet, consequently do not contemplate
organized enforcement of Library rules.
(When there is trouble, it is spotty, according to
the librarians. Nevertheless, Stanford students
should be intelligent enough to use their own Li
brary properly without the prodding of "Someone
in Authority."
(It is also possible that readers Robinson and
Bryan are using the Library too infrequently to
justify their words of criticism. To our knowledge,
neither one is now registered as a student, teacher,
administrator, or Library employee of this Univer
sity.—The Editor)
