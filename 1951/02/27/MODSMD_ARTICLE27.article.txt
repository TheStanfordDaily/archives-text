A tew of Stanford's summer pil- |
piims returned from abroad last fall
claiming that you never know a Eu
ropean until you live with him. Oth
ers said that until you have hauled
logs with him or helped him erect a
playground from the rubble of a
caput city you can't even speak his
language.
These are the propagandists of a
new order of tourism. They tell of
their meeting with Europe or Latin
America through the American
Friends Service Committee, the Put
ney Experiment in International
Living, or similar groups which soft
pedal tourism in favor of making real >
friends on a global scale.
The Putney Experiment will
(:ike coeducational groups of 10
students each into 22 different
countries next summer. Hospital
ity of European families has held !
the summer's expense, minus I
trans - Atlantic travel, near $400. I

slightly less than a conducted tour.
Two students from Stanford, who
! have seen France as Experimenters,
j lived for the first month as members
of Bordeaux families, picking up
their French with the port city's lo
cal color.
Their young French hosts joined
them for the rest of the summer,
camping and bicycling through the
Basque country, the peasant festi
vals of Brittany, the historic wealth
of Provence.
Again this June, families in Flor
ence, Bonn, Madrid, Helsinki, or
Calcutta will be introducing Ameri
cans to their countries on the Ex
periment programs.
Co-operative farm work on an Is
j raeli kibbutz, road-building with a
Yugoslav Youth Brigade, and arche
-1 ological excursions out from Beirut
I are the Experiment's newest offer
j ings.
Family contacts made this year
will give Americans personal en
j try into Japan, Yugoslavia. India,
I and Syria-Lebanon as well as the

more well-trodden paths through
Europe, Asia, and the two Ameri
cas.
Applications should be filed as
soon as possible through the lIR
Travel Bureau or Bill Crocker, the
Experiment's representative on this
campus.
The Quakers and similar service
groups maintain that working by the
side of a Dane or a Britisher or an
Algerian builds the most valuable
acquaintances. The AFSC alone will
take 70 students next summer to
their international work camps in
Jamaica, Haiti, and the countries of
Europe.
Americans, in common labor
with students of all nations, will
rebuild the homes, schools, and
spirit of their host country.
About $500 will cover a student's
summer in a European work camp,
including ship's passage. The dead
line for AFSC applicants is March 1.
Necessary forms and information
are -available at the lIR Travel Bu
reau or at the Friends' Center in San
Francisco.

claiming that you never know a Eu
ropean until you live with him. Oth
ers said that until you have hauled
logs with him or helped him erect a
playground from the rubble of a
caput city you can't even speak his
language.
These are the propagandists of a
new order of tourism. They tell of
their meeting with Europe or Latin
America through the American
Friends Service Committee, the Put
ney Experiment in International
Living, or similar groups which soft
pedal tourism in favor of making real >
friends on a global scale.
The Putney Experiment will
(:ike coeducational groups of 10
students each into 22 different
countries next summer. Hospital
ity of European families has held !
the summer's expense, minus I
trans - Atlantic travel, near $400. I

slightly less than a conducted tour.
Two students from Stanford, who
! have seen France as Experimenters,
j lived for the first month as members
of Bordeaux families, picking up
their French with the port city's lo
cal color.
Their young French hosts joined
them for the rest of the summer,
camping and bicycling through the
Basque country, the peasant festi
vals of Brittany, the historic wealth
of Provence.
Again this June, families in Flor
ence, Bonn, Madrid, Helsinki, or
Calcutta will be introducing Ameri
cans to their countries on the Ex
periment programs.
Co-operative farm work on an Is
j raeli kibbutz, road-building with a
Yugoslav Youth Brigade, and arche
-1 ological excursions out from Beirut
I are the Experiment's newest offer
j ings.
Family contacts made this year
will give Americans personal en
j try into Japan, Yugoslavia. India,
I and Syria-Lebanon as well as the

more well-trodden paths through
Europe, Asia, and the two Ameri
cas.
Applications should be filed as
soon as possible through the lIR
Travel Bureau or Bill Crocker, the
Experiment's representative on this
campus.
The Quakers and similar service
groups maintain that working by the
side of a Dane or a Britisher or an
Algerian builds the most valuable
acquaintances. The AFSC alone will
take 70 students next summer to
their international work camps in
Jamaica, Haiti, and the countries of
Europe.
Americans, in common labor
with students of all nations, will
rebuild the homes, schools, and
spirit of their host country.
About $500 will cover a student's
summer in a European work camp,
including ship's passage. The dead
line for AFSC applicants is March 1.
