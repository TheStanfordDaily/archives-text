WASHINGTONâ€”The Senate un
animously approved a $2,358,092,000
atom-age Navy modernization pro
gram today and Gen. Omar N. Brad
ley reluctantly accepted a compro
mise bill to lower the draft induction
age from 19 to 18V2.
The twin actions came shortly af
ter Bradley testified that the United
States now has about 250,000 fighting
men in Korea and that a plan for ro
tating men who have been in combat
six to eight months should be oper
ating on a limited basis "pretty
soon."
The Senate bill, which was ap
proved by voice vote, already had
been cleared by the House and now
goes to President Truman for his sig
nature. It would authorize the Navy
to build a new 57,000-ton super-car
rier capable of handling atom bomb
ers.
