# Foreign Student Says German Incentive Gone
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
While diplomats are debating the touchy question of just how
far Germany should be rearmed, the German people are asking—
what have we to fight for?
According to Klaus Vollmer, former German soldier and Stan- !
ford foreign scholarship student from Berlin, the Germans know

they must fight against Communism,
but as for a positive objective—that
is lacking.
As a result of the last war there
has been a psychological breakdown
among the people: half of the Ger
man homes have lost their fathers;
the women hate war and stemming
from them, there is a widespread re
action against it; former German sol
diers think they have lost their
honor; 18- and 19-year-olds think it
is a crime to be a soldier. The fight
ing spirit that is so necessary in the
Germany army is crushed, Klaus
said; there is no Germany to fight for.
Klaus described the change that
has come about with the introduct
ion of democratic ideals hy the
Allies—the emphasis is on the indi
vidual rather than the nation or
family.
In the elementary schools, the
"push'' that characterized former
German education has been replaced
by the American way. In the old sys
tem, Klaus, who has studied two
years at the Free University of Ber
lin, explained, there was a strong
pressure driving the better students
ahead, and leaving the poorer ones
behind. It was the top of the class
that set the pace, not the average
student.
Today, under the American in
fluence, it is the individual that
counts and the result is that stu
dents are not ready for work at the
universities, where the old system
is still intact;
Turning to his personal experience
as a Boy Scout leader for an illus
tration, Klaus pointed out that even
among the Scouts there has come a
change—hardly any of the boys want
to become soldiers; whereas in the
last war, it was considered an honor
to serve one's country. Little games
such as guessing the distance from
one point to another are frowned
upon and discouraged by the Allies
as being militaristic, Klaus said.
With the emphasis on the indi
vidual, the new goal for the young
German today, Klaus declared, is
to make money.
As in the case of American boys,
Klaus said, German youths have no
desire to be drafted. This is <i sharp
contrast to the attitude that pre
vailed in the last war, when a Ger
man youth desired to be as near the
enemy as possible, in the most dan
gerous job. Today a German draftee
would like the safest job possible, if
he has to fight at all.
Klaus feels that nationalism is no

more in Germany, as is evidenced by I
the failure of nationalistic parties in i
recent elections. Instead there is a j
strong move for a United States of
Europe, sparked by the students.
As for the relative appeals of
democracy and communism, the
former finds its greatest admirers
among the intellectuals who don't
like to be ordered what to think.
For the farmers and workers, com
munism embodies one single idea,
whereas democracy embodies
many, which makes democracy a
bit confusing.
Klaus is taking the NROTC pro
gram at Stanford, because of an in
terest in military science. He finds a J
strong difference between the Ameri
can and German systems of training I
an officer. In his country 20 months
of concentrated training was the
minimum a would-be officer would
have to undergo. Furthermore, there |
was a separation of military life from
education; the combination as it ex- \
ists here would be considered mili
taristic.

to become soldiers; whereas in the
last war, it was considered an honor
to serve one's country. Little games
such as guessing the distance from
one point to another are frowned
upon and discouraged by the Allies
as being militaristic, Klaus said.
With the emphasis on the indi
vidual, the new goal for the young
German today, Klaus declared, is
to make money.
As in the case of American boys,
Klaus said, German youths have no
desire to be drafted. This is <i sharp
contrast to the attitude that pre
vailed in the last war, when a Ger
man youth desired to be as near the
enemy as possible, in the most dan
gerous job. Today a German draftee
would like the safest job possible, if
he has to fight at all.
Klaus feels that nationalism is no

more in Germany, as is evidenced by I
the failure of nationalistic parties in i
recent elections. Instead there is a j
strong move for a United States of
Europe, sparked by the students.
As for the relative appeals of
democracy and communism, the
former finds its greatest admirers
among the intellectuals who don't
like to be ordered what to think.
For the farmers and workers, com
munism embodies one single idea,
whereas democracy embodies
many, which makes democracy a
bit confusing.
Klaus is taking the NROTC pro
gram at Stanford, because of an in
terest in military science. He finds a J
strong difference between the Ameri
can and German systems of training I
an officer. In his country 20 months
of concentrated training was the
minimum a would-be officer would
have to undergo. Furthermore, there |
was a separation of military life from
education; the combination as it ex- \
ists here would be considered mili
taristic.

While diplomats are debating the touchy question of just how
far Germany should be rearmed, the German people are asking—
what have we to fight for?
According to Klaus Vollmer, former German soldier and Stan- !
ford foreign scholarship student from Berlin, the Germans know

they must fight against Communism,
but as for a positive objective—that
is lacking.
As a result of the last war there
has been a psychological breakdown
among the people: half of the Ger
man homes have lost their fathers;
the women hate war and stemming
from them, there is a widespread re
action against it; former German sol
diers think they have lost their
honor; 18- and 19-year-olds think it
is a crime to be a soldier. The fight
ing spirit that is so necessary in the
Germany army is crushed, Klaus
said; there is no Germany to fight for.
Klaus described the change that
has come about with the introduct
ion of democratic ideals hy the
Allies—the emphasis is on the indi
vidual rather than the nation or
family.
In the elementary schools, the
"push'' that characterized former
German education has been replaced
by the American way. In the old sys
tem, Klaus, who has studied two
years at the Free University of Ber
lin, explained, there was a strong
pressure driving the better students
ahead, and leaving the poorer ones
behind. It was the top of the class
that set the pace, not the average
student.
Today, under the American in
fluence, it is the individual that
counts and the result is that stu
dents are not ready for work at the
universities, where the old system
is still intact;
Turning to his personal experience
as a Boy Scout leader for an illus
tration, Klaus pointed out that even
among the Scouts there has come a
change—hardly any of the boys want
to become soldiers; whereas in the
last war, it was considered an honor
to serve one's country. Little games
