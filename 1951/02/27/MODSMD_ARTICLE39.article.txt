### DIGER ODELL 
We aren't going to try to alibi Saturday night's game with the
big, bad men of Troy, but when an official makes such a flagrant
mistake, we feel that it should at least be pointed out.
It happened with about two minutes of play left in the game.
The Trojans led, 63 to 61. The names of the players and the ref in-

volved are long since forgotten, but
the action will remain for some time.
Taking the ball from out of bounds
under his own basket, a Trojan
guard threw a long overhand pass
down court to his right forward.
We're not sure if it was Don Under
wood or not, but the forward, tied
up for the moment by two Indians,
tossed a high looping pass back to
the guard who was not yet over the
center line. The Trojan guard
leaped high into the air and over
the line and caught the pass. Then
he landed on the Indian side of the
court. The point we wish to make is
that the Troy guard had not landed
on the same end of the court from
which the ball had been passed; he
was still in mid-air when he caught
the ball.
According to all rules and regula
tions USC should have lost posses
sion of the ball. A basketball cannot
lie passed BACK over the center line
by the offensive team, and that SC
guard — it was either Bob Kolf or
Tom Riach —technically could not be
over the center line until his feet
touched the floor.
The part that's hard to believe is
that the Trojan was all by himself
in mid-court, catching the ball and
then landing, while not four feet
from him on the sideline stood an
official watching the entire proce
dure. Even the loud cries that broke
from the stands as a few Indian root
ers realized what had happened
failed to wake the ref, who allowed
play to continue.
The result of this official mistake
was that USC managed to have Ram
stcad's fourth foul called on him in
their own inimitable fashion. They
connected on the free throw line to
lead, 64 to 61, and then went into a
stall that eventually spread our de
fense all over the court, thus en
abling the Trojans toscore four more
points.

i As we said before, we're not trying
j to alibi the game. The Cards played
! 35 or 36 minutes of good ball, Tucker
probably played the best ball he's
j ever played in those minutes, but
I after that the whole team fell apart,
j They just didn't have it any more,
i Three bad shots were taken that
i shouldn't have been, and three hor-
J rible passes were made.
That doesn't excuse the matter,
though, or the ref. If the Trojans
hadn't gone into a stall, things
I COULD have wound up differently.

While we're on the subject, where
| did USC dig up that rooting section
that sat on the Trojan players' bench
| Friday and Saturday nights?
There were only a handful of
{ them, but, in our book, they were
the lousiest bunch we've ever seen
on the Coast. They weren't students,
either; they were full-grown adults,
although their actions didn't show it.
Heckling the players is one thing,
but calling them names is going too
J far.
The height of rudeness appeared
when the ball rolled out of bounds
on their side of the court. Jack
O'Sullivan went over to pick up the
ball only to have it kicked from his
outstretched hands by a so - called
lady in the Trojan rooting section.
The tactics used by USC on the
court were bad enough. We can re
member one instance Friday night
when Tucker went up for a lay-in,
and Bob Morton stood under him
and calmly threw his hip out, knock
ing Eddie off balance. The foul was
too obvious not to have been called;
there were others which weren't.
To our way of thinking the Trojan
rooting section reflected the action of
SC on the court, all of which puts
them in a pretty bad light. Some
thing like that can be carried too far.

While we're on the subject, where
| did USC dig up that rooting section
that sat on the Trojan players' bench
| Friday and Saturday nights?
There were only a handful of
{ them, but, in our book, they were
the lousiest bunch we've ever seen
on the Coast. They weren't students,
either; they were full-grown adults,
although their actions didn't show it.
Heckling the players is one thing,
but calling them names is going too
J far.
The height of rudeness appeared
when the ball rolled out of bounds
on their side of the court. Jack
O'Sullivan went over to pick up the
ball only to have it kicked from his
outstretched hands by a so - called
lady in the Trojan rooting section.
The tactics used by USC on the
court were bad enough. We can re
member one instance Friday night
when Tucker went up for a lay-in,
and Bob Morton stood under him
and calmly threw his hip out, knock
ing Eddie off balance. The foul was
too obvious not to have been called;
there were others which weren't.
To our way of thinking the Trojan
rooting section reflected the action of
SC on the court, all of which puts
them in a pretty bad light. Some
thing like that can be carried too far.
We aren't going to try to alibi Saturday night's game with the
big, bad men of Troy, but when an official makes such a flagrant
mistake, we feel that it should at least be pointed out.
It happened with about two minutes of play left in the game.
The Trojans led, 63 to 61. The names of the players and the ref in-

volved are long since forgotten, but
the action will remain for some time.
Taking the ball from out of bounds
under his own basket, a Trojan
guard threw a long overhand pass
down court to his right forward.
We're not sure if it was Don Under
wood or not, but the forward, tied
up for the moment by two Indians,
tossed a high looping pass back to
the guard who was not yet over the
center line. The Trojan guard
leaped high into the air and over
the line and caught the pass. Then
he landed on the Indian side of the
court. The point we wish to make is
that the Troy guard had not landed
on the same end of the court from
which the ball had been passed; he
was still in mid-air when he caught
the ball.
According to all rules and regula
tions USC should have lost posses
sion of the ball. A basketball cannot
lie passed BACK over the center line
by the offensive team, and that SC
guard — it was either Bob Kolf or
Tom Riach —technically could not be
over the center line until his feet
touched the floor.
The part that's hard to believe is
that the Trojan was all by himself
in mid-court, catching the ball and
then landing, while not four feet
from him on the sideline stood an
official watching the entire proce
dure. Even the loud cries that broke
from the stands as a few Indian root
ers realized what had happened
failed to wake the ref, who allowed
play to continue.
The result of this official mistake
was that USC managed to have Ram
stcad's fourth foul called on him in
their own inimitable fashion. They
connected on the free throw line to
lead, 64 to 61, and then went into a
stall that eventually spread our de
fense all over the court, thus en
abling the Trojans toscore four more
points.

i As we said before, we're not trying
j to alibi the game. The Cards played
! 35 or 36 minutes of good ball, Tucker
probably played the best ball he's
j ever played in those minutes, but
I after that the whole team fell apart,
j They just didn't have it any more,
i Three bad shots were taken that
i shouldn't have been, and three hor-
J rible passes were made.
That doesn't excuse the matter,
though, or the ref. If the Trojans
hadn't gone into a stall, things
I COULD have wound up differently.
