## Baseballers Meet S.J.S. 
### 
Stanford's varsity nine drops out
of the baseball stratosphere and
comes down to meet mere college
competition for the first time this
year when they engage the unsus
pecting and untried San Jose State
Spartans here at 3:15 p.m.
Alter holding their own pretty
well against three semi - pro clubs,
with the emphasis on pro, the In
dians ought to be ready and willing
to go against the non-play-for-pay
boys.
Knowing that the Staters will be
out to cut the Cards' one-game win
ning streak shorter than the Holly
wood Stars' new uniforms, Coach
Dutch Fehring has nominated pitch-
I ing ace Rog Osenbaugh to cool off
! any such Spartan aspirations.
Today's lineup will see some new
faces starting for the Cards. Dick
Cole goes at third, Jim Agar in right,
Hal Hennacy opens at first, and the
j veteran Bill Herron will catch.
The rest of the Stanford lineup re
mains the same, with Bruce Cam-
I eron at short, Chuck Essegian in left,
Dick Clegg in center, and Art Abra
; hamson at second.
