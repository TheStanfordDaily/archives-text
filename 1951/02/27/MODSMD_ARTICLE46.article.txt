# Cards, Bears In Cellar Go
## 
### 
The final week's firing in the PCC j
Southern Division basketball chase |
will find the conference spotlight
centered on UCLA's hardwood hide- !
away in Westwood for the Bruins'
pennant - settling series with the
cross-town Trojans; but local inter- |
est will be following the twin ' bill
between Stanford and California to
decide who slides down the cellar j
door.
The Indians and Bears are cur
rently tied for the basement position i
with identical 3 and 7 records fol- |
lowing Stanford's split with USC
and Cal's double loss to UCLA last
weekend. They'll argue it out in the |
Cow Palace Friday night, at Berke- j
ley's Men's Gymnasium Saturday
eve.
For Everett Dean's Redskins,
fresh from their best weekend per
formance of the year, the main prob- |
lem will be that of stopping Bear j
pivotman Bill Hagler. The lanky !
Berkeley veteran is his school's top i
point - maker of all time, having j
passed Andy Wolf's former mark '
several weeks back, and he's deadly j
whether performing at center or for
ward.
Dean disclosed yesterday that his
charges will engage in only light j
workouts this week. They took a ;
complete rest yesterday, turning the 1
Pavilion over to the Braves and
frosh for their second civil war of
the season.
But the Farm headman was reti- j
cent concerning detailed plans for
the cross-bay series. In commenting i
that "California height may influ
ence the Stanford lineup," he did,
however, intimate that such lanky
reserves as Bill Stevenson and
George Zaninovich may got into the
frays.
