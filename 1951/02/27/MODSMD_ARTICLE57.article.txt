# Roll, Records To Be Placed Under Plaque
## 
### 
Last week the Stanford branch of
hte American Society of Mechanical
Engineers puured 150 pounds of mol
! ten brass into the mold of this year's
| senior class plate.
In June the Class of '51 will for
mally lock up its records and sot
; them solidly under the walk in front
of the Memorial Church. The brass
plate just cast will cover the docu
! ments and preserve them from later,
less reverent ages of shoe - sculling
| Farm students.
Since 1892
ASME has been casting molds for
| senior plates since 1892, according to
Donald L. Mason, assistant professor
of mechanical engineering. Mason
j came to Stanford from the Univer
j sity of Oregon ten years ago and has
j been supervising the annual opera
j tion ever since. By the time here
! tires, the line will stretch nearly past
the Mathematics Department.
Each year ASME makes a contract
with the senior class to do the job,
[ saving the new graduates from onc
| half to two - thirds the amount it
j would cost to have the plate made
j commercially.
The plate, under which a small
lead vault safeguards the class doc
uments, is cast in the middle of win
! ter quarter. From then until June
! ASME grinds and polishes it in
| preparation for the formal ceremony
j during Senior Week when the plate
j will be officially set into the ground.
Five in '48
In 1948 five plates were put down
at once, replacing those made of
J concrete used temporarily during
j the war. It takes about one day to
; fill the mold with the 2100 F. brass.
The sacred papers which the Class
i of '51 will seal up will include the
! class will, the senior roll, and old
I Dailies. Chairman of the Plate Com
j mittee is Harry Lott.
When asked what is going to hap
pen when senior plates extend be
! yond the Petrography Lab, Mason
answered uneasily, "We'll just have
i to keep going around the block."
