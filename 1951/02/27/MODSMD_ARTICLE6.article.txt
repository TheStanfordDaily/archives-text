# Siegel to Tell Observations Regarding Brazil's Culture
## 
### 
Dr. Bernard J. Siegel, tonight's
Tuesday Evening Series speak
er, will draw the substance of
his talk, "Themes and Variations
in Brazilian Culture," from mate
rial gathered during a year's
work done in rural Brazilian vil
lages. The lecture begins at 7:30
in Memorial Hall.
Although not primarily concerned
j with politics and economics in the
I course of his research in South
I America, which ended last Septem
ber, Dr. Siegel said "you can't escape
noticing as extra-curricular activi
ties" current governmental trends.
Vargas Election
When the newly-elected President
Vargas was waging his campaign,
I Dr. Siegel was impressed by a vari
j ety of local reactions, ranging from
' the intellectuals who feared open
violence if Vargas were re-elected to
those who felt he didn't have a
chance.
"The political unification of Brazil,"
remarked the Stanford anthropolo
gist, by way of explanation, "and its
power as a nation are related to prob
lems of cultural unification."
Impact of West
Regional identification with a feel
ing of nationality, he went on, usu
ally stems from an economic situa
tion. "The impact of Western insti
! tutions and cultural diversity have
been very imperfectly studied so
j far."
Dr. Siegel teaches, in addition to
his work for the Anthropology De
partment, a few courses in the His
panic American Relations Depart
j mcnt. These now-required courses
deal with Indian and cultural proc
esses in South America.
America
Directly after he obtained his doc
torate, Dr. Siegel, as Co-ordinator of
Inter-American Affairs, was con
cerned with organization and syste
matization of data on the .societies
and cultures of Latin America.
The speaker will be introduced by
Professor Richard LaPiere of the
Stanford Sociology Department.
