# Farm Law Review Reports State Supreme Court Policy
## 
### 
The California State Supreme
Court prefers to hear cases which it !
feels were improperly decided rath- !
er than those involving novel points |
of law, the Stanford Law Review re- |
ported yesterday.
The Review also said American
citizens are being denied a constitu- j
tional guarantee because there are
no clear standards to guide the
State Department in refusing pass
ports.
Failure to provide these safe
guards, it concluded, is clearly a de
nial of due process of law. There
should be a minimum of government
interference in normal human activ- j
ities, the article adds, and no admin
istrative agcncy should bo cmpow- i
ered to prohibit these activities j
without a hearing. The one excep
tion should be public interest.
The Â§tanford Review said, in ref
erence to the cases heard by the
Supreme Court, the vast majority
were those in which the court dis- I
agreed with the District Court of
Appeals.
The editors said this survey should
help lawyers save time and money
by realizing how heavily the Court's
calendar has been weighted on the
side of disagreements on decisions
with the District Court.
