## UN Patrol Enters Seoul; Allies Outnumber Enemy 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 28 (UP) — A. U.S. Third Division
reconnaissance patrol fought its way into the suburbs of Seoul
early today while Allied advances all along the front wiped out the
gains of the abortive Communist counteroffensive.
The 11 Allied divisions totaling more than 160,000 men shattered

the cast end of the Communist dc- i
fense line above Pangnim Tuesday
and in gains ranging from two to
four miles dislodged Communists on
the west end and in the middle of
the 60-mile central Korean front.
The Chinese struck back with a
night attack in the center of the line
where they poured southward two !
weeks ago through South Korean
troops, but the South Koreans this j
time threw back the enemy with the |
help of fast-firing artillery.
For the first time since the Chi
nese entered the Korean war last
fall, the United Nation ground
forces held a slight numerical supe- j
riority over the Communists today, i
Lt. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway's '
Eighth Army in a month of savage
fighting chopped down the enemy j
force until now it outnumbers the i
Chinese and North Korean troops :
below the !iBth parallel, at least for j
the moment.
The estimated number of Commu
nists is a military secret, but the Al
lies have reported 121,868 Red cas- j
ualties.


CLEAN OUT RED HILL—Dug in on side of an embankment, this United Nations gun crew hold
their ears as they let loose a blast at the enemy entrenched on a strategic hill. The hill was
cleaned out and taken as the Allies continued current "killer" drive against the Reds.
