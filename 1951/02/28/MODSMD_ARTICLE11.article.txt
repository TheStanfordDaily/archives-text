"Hut, two, three, four."
Take this cadence in a femi
nine voice, add the beat of one

seersucker skirts, and you have
women training to become re

Marine Corps.
Four Stanford women, Tina Clapp,
Elizabeth Ayrault, Cynthia Holcomb,
-inr! Beverly Bock, attended the
Navy's Reserve Officer Candidate
HOC) six - week training course at
jrcat Lakes, 111., last summer.
Caryl Harms participated in a sim
;lar Marine Corps program at Quan
tico, Va., the Women's Officer Traili
ng Corps (WOCT).

Informative talks on (lie ROC
and WOTC programs will be in
rludrd in (he Women's Vocom
meeting tonight at 7 in tlie lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
Women's opportunities in other
armed and civilian serviecs will
also he discussed.

These two recently established
irograms arc similar in purpose and
irrangement. Upon completion of 12
weeks of training (in two .six-week
neriods) and achievement of a col
'cge degree, the candidate, when 21,
nay become a commissioned reserve
>flTieer (ensign in the Navy, second
icutcnant in the Marines).
She will be on call during national
emergency, but not obligated to
serve unless so called. In addition, a
few of the outstanding WOTC grad
uates arc chosen for regular Marine
Corps commissions.
College women are eligible to both
programs. They must pass a physi
cal and comply with age require
ments of the particular program.
Travel to and from the place of
training is paid for by the service,
md uniforms are provided.
The women arc paid during train
ing at enlisted rates, beginning at
'ihout $!W for the junior course.
The Navy's ROC program for

women corresponds to one of the
same iwmn for men at Newport, R. 1.,
and San Diego. The women's pro
gram w;is established last. year. Be
fore applying for training, women
must .join I lie Naval Reserve, though
they are not required to join an or
ganized drill unit.
About HO women attended the
beginning ROC course last summer.
'I he Marine Corps WOTC was in
stituted two years ago. The male
equivalent, the Platoon Leaders'
School, is also held at Quantico.
Applicants to the Marine program
must fulfil] approximately the same
requirements as for the Navy course.
However, the women arc not re
quired to join the Reserve until they
have been accepted by the WOTC.
Some 50 women are accepted for
the junior class each summer, in
cluding some not in college.
Unlike the Navy ROC program,

where candidates must take the jun
ior and senior courses in separate
summers, the Marine courses are
given consecutively so that women
may take the full 12 weeks in fine
summer.
Full Daily Schedule
The daily schedule for the women
in both programs last summer in
cluded six hours of class work, an
hoilr of drill, and an hour of physical
recreation.
This schedule was modified from
time to time to make room for shots,
field trips, extra drill, and special
events.
Instruction, given by officers of the
two services, included the history,
traditions, customs, and organization
of their service; Naval law. rules
and regulations, leadership, corre
spondence. and personnel classifica
tion and record-keeping.
Added t<» such diversified subjects

was an overall view of women in the 1 c
service, here and abroad, and perti- j
nent information regarding there- j
serves. A survey course in Naval
weapons ,and navigation gave the
ROCs an understanding of the tools |
and language of those fields.
Field Trips Add Variety
Field trips were informative di- |
versions from the regular course of
study. The ROC women attended
demonstrations of large naval guns j i
and electronics equipment on the \
base. Perhaps the highlight of the \
course was a four-hour cruise on j t
Lake Michigan in a destroyer escort. \
Field trips for the WOTC students t
included demonstrations of various ; ,
j aspects of combat, including Marine c
infantry weapons, chemical warfare. ;
i and rifle platoon tactics. I
They were also special guests at I
! the helicopter demonstration Riven i

J for perennial washing, letter-writ- j
' ing, and studying, as well as recrc- i :

could also go tr> the movies, the Fn
j listed Men's Club, where dances
i were held with the Platoon Lead
-1 ers' School, and Quantico in the evc
| nings.
Sports recreation available to the
ROCs during class time and liberty
included swimming, lan ball, vol
] Icyball, and sailing. The WOTC
