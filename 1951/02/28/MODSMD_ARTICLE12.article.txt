# University of Delhi Will Benefit From Tonight's Eddy Concert
## 
### 
The University of Delhi has been chosen as the one to benefit
from the proceeds of the Nelson Eddy concert.
A committee, headed by Kay Chort, met Monday night to make
the final decision on the bases of financial need and cultural ad
vantages to Stanford.
Serving on the committee in an advisory capacity only are the
following faculty members:
Professor Harold Fisher; Robert C. North, research assistant at
the Hoover Institute; Dean Carl Spaeth of the Law School; Dr.
Frederic Spiegelberg, Asiatic and Slavic Studies; Willard Wa
terous, foreign student advisor; and H. Donald Winbigler, Dean
of Men.
Stanford, through lIR, will form an affiliation with the Univer
sity of Delhi. Affiliation, defined by Pat Terry at the meeting, be
gins with an initial grant and builds up to an exchange of students
and professors.
The money, to be channeled through the V/orld Student Service
Fund, will come from funds raised in a drive last fall coupled
with thp receipts of the Eddy concert.
Dick Thomas, a representative of the WSSF, on a recent visit to

India found that in New Delhi, where
there are a great number of refu
gees, they were able to use WSSF
funds to best advantage in the build
ing of student hostels. In a letter to
the lIR, he recommended that Stan
ford's contribution be used for a
similar purpose.
The hostel would serve hundreds
of refugee students through its li
brary and reading room. The funds
raised here at Stanford, if used for l>
hostel, will multiply themselves
many times. The enthusiasm created
in a hostel committee in India would
be channeled into a self-help pro
gram wherein students would go out
among the merchants and towns
people to raise the rest of the funds
to carry on the project.
At Delhi, according to Thomas,
there is sufficient organization to
carry out the plans of the Stanford
group.
"lIR wants to stimulate mutual in
terests, and exchanges of cultural in
! formation through letters and maga
| zines," said Kay Chort. The commit
tee decided that this could best be
accomplished at the University of
Delhi. This university is situated
near the capital of India which would
! possibly have advantages in offer
i ing political ideas of the Indian stu
dents. The lIR has many informative
magazines at their disposal which
could be sent, in exchange, to India.
Tickets will be sold in front of the
! Cellar from 9 to 12 in the morning,
1 to 5 in the Concert Series Office,
! and at the ticket office at 7:30 p.m.
' j They are priced at $3, $2.40, $1.80
