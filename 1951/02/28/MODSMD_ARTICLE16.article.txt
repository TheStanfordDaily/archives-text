# Card Nine Tops San Jose With Controversial Play
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanfords' varsity horsehiders opened their intercollegiate com
petition yesterday afternoon with a controversial 1 to 0 win over
San Jose State. Dave Rosenkrantz, who scored the lone run of
the game, was the center of a lengthy debate between San Jose
coach Walt Williams, Stanford's assistant coach, Dutch Fehring,

and plate umpire, Frank Silvers. I
Rosenkrantz, pinch-hitting for
Tony Stellar, led off the bottom half
of the seventh inning by blasting a
single into left, field. Bruce Cameron
moved him to second with a sacrifice j
bunt along the third base line, and ;
Art Abrahamson followed with a j
single into center field to score Ros- j
enkrantz from second.
The controversy was waged
around the fact that Rosenkrantz
was sent up to pinch-hit for Roger
Osenbaugh in the fourth frame
with two out and Hal Hennacy on
first base. With the count 2 and 1
<in Rosenkrantz, Hennacy was
thrown out, trying to steal second
base, to end the inning.
Coach Feb ring went on the a.s- j
sumption that inasmuch as Hennacy !
was thrown out while Rosenkrantz
was stil! at bat, be not officially en- i
tered the game. When Rosenkrantz (
went in to bat in the seventh inning, !
there was some question on San i
Jose's part, as to whether or not he
could re-enter the game. However, j
after Fehring voiced his contention
that Rosenkrantz bar) not. officially
horn in the game, San Jose let the !
issue drop until the end of the inning, j
Williams and Silvcra came over to j
the Stanford dugout, where they !
discussed the situation to some
length with Fehring. However, since
the inning was over, and the run had j
already scored, the discussion re- !
suited in no further action.
Consultation with the rule hook
after the game showed that Feh
ring had erred, in that nnce a pinch
hitter has announced himself In (he
umpire, he is officially in the game
and can not re-enter the game
after being removed.
Williams' mistake, which cost him I
ihr game, was that he didn't press i
the question when it, was brought up '
after Rosenkrantz had taken the first j
pitch in the seventh inning.
Once again, the strong point of the |
Indians' showing was the perform- j
ance of their three pitchcrs, Roger
Osenbaugh. Tony Stellar, and Bob
Murphy. Osenbaugh, who worked
the first four innings, showed beau
tiful control, staying ahead of the
i.itters all the time, throwing only
11 balls in 45 pitches.
This afternoon the Braves nine will
lake on the San Francisco Marines
<t 3:15 in the Sunken Diamond. Jack
Alexander is slated to pot the start
ing nod on the mound for the Rcd
men. Jim Powell, Lloyd Wcstphal,
Jim Manheimer, and Larry Smith
are also on call for mound duty.
