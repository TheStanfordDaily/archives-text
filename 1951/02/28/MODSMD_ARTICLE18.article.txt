# Advice on That Career Hunt
## 
### 
Not so long ago, a freshman girl dropped in
at the Counselor for Women's office. She had
heard that Women's Vocom was presenting a
program about a profession in which she was
interested.
Would it be all right, she asked, for her to
attend the program, even though she wasn't a
member of Vocom?
Misunderstandings like this apparently have
obscured the purpose of the Women's Voca
tional Committee. This Committee is directly
a part of AWS, and its programs are designed
for all women students at Stanford.
Since the establishment of the Counseling
and Testing Service, Vocom has turned to pro
viding a more general type of program for
women who plan to work after college. Leav
ing to the Testing Service the task of giving
specific career advice, Vocom is stressing
ideas and information that will be helpful to
the woman in any major.
Along with this change has come an in
creased emphasis on the fact that the Commit
ter operates as a two-way proposition. The
Vocom representative from each house brings
information on programs to the women in the
holise. She should also return their ideas and
suggestions to the Committee.
Outstanding women in almost every field
can be found in this vicinity, if Stanford women
indicate an interest in hearing them speak.
However, the program committee cannot ask
these women to donate their time and experi
ence unless the response justifies that dona
tion.
Recently, for example, Vocom arranged a
talk by a Peninsula woman who is an outstand
ing civic leader. An embarrassingly small

group appeared to hear her speak—especially
embarrassing since this woman had cancelled
a civilian defense appointment with Governor
Warren to appear on campus.
Tonight in the Women's Clubhouse the AWS
Vocational Committee will present a program
of information on the women's armed and ci
vilian services. This is not a recruiting pro
gram; it is designed to give straight information
on both the opportunities and drawbacks of
careers with these groups.
So uncertain is the country's future today
that it would seem wise for every woman to
have some knowledge of these services, which
may need her help in the future.
Even if you feel sure that you will never be
a member of the military or of the Red Cross or
USO, we think you can learn a great deal from
hearing and meeting women-.V/ho have proved
their ability and leadership in these careers

Tonight in the Women's Clubhouse the AWS
Vocational Committee will present a program
of information on the women's armed and ci
vilian services. This is not a recruiting pro
gram; it is designed to give straight information
on both the opportunities and drawbacks of
careers with these groups.
So uncertain is the country's future today
that it would seem wise for every woman to
have some knowledge of these services, which
may need her help in the future.
Even if you feel sure that you will never be
a member of the military or of the Red Cross or
USO, we think you can learn a great deal from
hearing and meeting women-.V/ho have proved
their ability and leadership in these careers

Not so long ago, a freshman girl dropped in
at the Counselor for Women's office. She had
heard that Women's Vocom was presenting a
program about a profession in which she was
interested.
Would it be all right, she asked, for her to
attend the program, even though she wasn't a
member of Vocom?
Misunderstandings like this apparently have
obscured the purpose of the Women's Voca
tional Committee. This Committee is directly
a part of AWS, and its programs are designed
for all women students at Stanford.
Since the establishment of the Counseling
and Testing Service, Vocom has turned to pro
viding a more general type of program for
women who plan to work after college. Leav
ing to the Testing Service the task of giving
specific career advice, Vocom is stressing
ideas and information that will be helpful to
the woman in any major.
Along with this change has come an in
creased emphasis on the fact that the Commit
ter operates as a two-way proposition. The
Vocom representative from each house brings
information on programs to the women in the
holise. She should also return their ideas and
suggestions to the Committee.
Outstanding women in almost every field
can be found in this vicinity, if Stanford women
indicate an interest in hearing them speak.
However, the program committee cannot ask
these women to donate their time and experi
ence unless the response justifies that dona
tion.
Recently, for example, Vocom arranged a
talk by a Peninsula woman who is an outstand
ing civic leader. An embarrassingly small

group appeared to hear her speak—especially
embarrassing since this woman had cancelled
a civilian defense appointment with Governor
Warren to appear on campus.
