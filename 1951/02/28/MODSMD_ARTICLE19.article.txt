# A 						Point on Rome
## 
### 
Just a note of clarification.
To go to Rome or not to go still seems to be
a moot guestion. However, if ASSU does send
an "official delegate," Excom has voted to ap
propriate no more than $100 of student funds to
finance the journey. Representatives hope to
budget a lesser amount.
The remaining cost (which will run around
$500 if a student is sent from Palo Alto) will
have to be collected from outside sources.
Although the Daily reported the $100 figure
correctly in last Thursday's issue, it seems
there has been some misunderstanding of the
financial picture among the student body since
that time.
