# CAMPUS OPINION
## Clarifying the Rome Issue 
### 
To the Editor:
Here are a few personal observations which may
help throw light on the "Pressure Group" letters to
the Editor of Monday, Feb. 26: (One should obtain ac
cess to a Monday issue of the Daily to fully under
stand these observations).
I. There is no reason to believe that a conflict of
allegiance exists or need exist between the accused
representatives of the ASSU and some other organ
ization or ideal.
2. It is difficult to see how Excom could have been
"UNWILLINGLY" forced into agreement with Mr.
O'Connell and Mr. Jonas.
3. Stanford University has not been proved either
willing to promote the Rome Congress.
4. The "Bi|* Two presure group" DOES have defin
ite limitations on the choice of a delegate: namely, an
Excom veto.
5. Mr. Jonas and Mr. O'Connell have been con
sistently the two strongest proponents of referen
dum on this issue. (Excom previously voted against
such action.)
G. It is ridiculous to assume that Excom has not the
tight to reverse its position on an issue.
7. The alleged drop in prestige of the "university
across the Bay" was at least as much the fault of a
group of insistent regents as anyone else.
8. Excom could act on very few issues if it were
required to stay within the limits of its election "plat
form."
It seems to me that the only real issues at stake
rue: 1. Should the ASSU help send an official delegate
to the Home Congress; and 2. Should Excom or the
Stanford student body make the decision.
112 am personally in favor of the Rome Congress
delegate. To me the only "imperative practicality"
is that men multiply their efforts in the direction of
realizing (heir "great dreams" of world peace. The
only impracticably is that men refuse to seek other
means than war in the solution of international
problems.
As to the second issue, I feel, although Excom does
have the right to proceed, that in this instance a refer
endum would not only be the most democratic pro
cedure, but would also provide a realistic picture of
Stanford opinion. However, the resolution suggested
by Mr. Carson should be examined since it does not
present the actual alternatives.
