To the Editor:
... I cannot see why Excom changed its mind (on
the Rome proposal). What good does this trip to
Rome do for anybody besides 1) the delegate; and 2)
the Student Federalists?
By this token, Excom should also subsidize a person
from Ram's Head to go to New York, see the plays,
and report on them to the student body.
No action will be taken by our representative.
Stanford would not follow the dictates of the conven
tion in Rome. What good does this expenditure do
for Leland Stanford Junior University?
