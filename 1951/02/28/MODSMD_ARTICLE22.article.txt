# More on Library Noise

To the Editor:
The untimely expose of the debacle in the Main |
Library has shattered my dreams of fortune from a !
popcorn concession. However, with the situation un
covered, it should be pointed out that the way to
check on a report of discipline failure is not by inter
view with those responsible for such discipline.
The most cursory investigation would reveal that
some time between 8 and 9 p.m. the clans begin to
gather in their haunt near the large "Silence" sign
and the water fountain. Suddenly all hell breaks
loose, a circumstance not explainable until one real
izes they are fiercely contending over the latest letters
to the editor and the effect of rubber shortages upon i
the resale value of sweaters.
The editor's reply to the complaint made poor logic; [
if a condition be factual, it becomes not less so when
reported by one who is perhaps not a full-time stu
dent. A cup of coffee to you, Sir, if you find it quiet
for tv/o nights in 10.
WAYNE C. IRWIN
(Reader Irwin, a full-time student, tells us the
condition IS factual—particularly in regard to the
Reserve Book Room, which is within easy earshot
of the 8-9 p.m. clambake in the lobby. Assuming
the noise is there—as it now seems to be—we would
ask those who would "take a break" in the lobby
either to keep the noise down or go outside for the
latest dope on rubber shortages and related items.
