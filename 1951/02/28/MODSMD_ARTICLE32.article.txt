# Student-Faculty Relations Aired
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Student-Fac
ulty Education Committee last Mon
day a proposal to improve social re
lations between students and the
faculty was discussed. The commit
tee recommended that living groups
invite professors to dinner and per
haps a ta>k afterward. This plan
I has worked successfully in several
dorms and fraternities.
It was reported that many students
would like to have some kind of
departmental social functions. The
committee suggested that interested
students take the initiative in start
ing such events.
The committee also discussed its
i senior seminar program, and a coun
| seling proposal. A sub-committee on
student - faculty rating reported on
plans to evaluate sophomore elective
requirements (introductory courses
in sociology, anthropology, econom
ics, political science, etc.).
