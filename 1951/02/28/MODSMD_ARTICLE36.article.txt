## Punts and Pitches The 						Big Move Is On 
### 
r l!iis weekend the Big Move is one—to the Cow Palace on Friday and to
Berkeley on Saturday.
its the 1 asketball version of the Big Game, and although the winner of
the ' t will do nothing more than escape lrom the dank, dark confines of
the conference cellar, the games ought to be pips. Observers and those "in
the know set m to think that Cal will be in for a few surprises, and that
goes for prima donna Billy Hagler, Cal's high-scoring center-forward. He
may find a few human handcuffs on him this weekend.
Stanford played its best ball of the season against USC. As Earl O'dell
pointed out yesterday, Stanford might have had a chance Saturday night
were it not lor a few ill-advised shots, a few bad passes, and referee Ken
Fa fans' wrong call.
Among other things, Coach Everett Dean is working on control of the
backboards thi.s week. The insertion of Bill Stevenson (six foot six) into
the lineup can not be underestimated. Stevenson, along with Jim Ram
■ tead (six foot four), may give the Cards the backboard control they so
desperately need to whip Cal. Also look for some action from Bruce Iver
.sen, who meshed 2" points in the frosh-jayvee game on Monday. He is an
excellent team player and a smooth floor man. Tab George Zaninovich and
Paul Johnson, also.
And so we gaze into our crystal hall (a technicolor one) and look for
Stanford to do some winning (his weekend, .lumping Jack O'Sullivan

in; Walsh will be tanking them from 40 feet out; and Stevenson, An
drew-., and company will be sweeping the backboards.

But if Stanford is to win, it will depend to a large extent on how many
looters mak. the trek to the Cow Palace and Berkeley. When Stanford
consented to shift the Friday game from our matchbox to the more spacious
Cow Palace, it lost a "door advantage" of six to eight points. Sure, it's the
same kind of hardwood, the baskets are the same distance from the floor,
and the rims are the same size on every court, so what's the difference
where they play? The difference is simply that the home team has the
psychological lift of having a supporting rooting section.
Thus, the Dcanmen's chances to win will increase in direct proportion to
ihe number of rabid rooters who ride, fly, swim, walk, or crawl to the two
games.
Coach Dean had this to say yesterday: "There is a recognized floor
advantage of from si\ to eight points. The transfer to the Cow Palace
was made in the interest of basketball—in letting more people, especially
alun.ni, see the classic. We hope Cal will reciprocate by moving their
home game to the Cow Palace next year. It will aid the team a lot to
have a strong rooting section there and at Berkeley on Saturday. A good
rooting section helps the leant more than the rooters realize."
Incidentally, be sure to get to the games early so you can see Stanford's
"best-ever" yearling team take care of the Cal frosh.
And so the Big Move is on. With white saddle shoes held high, banners
waving, and a Rally Com member tucked under each arm, it's off to the
basketball games.
See ya there.

consented to shift the Friday game from our matchbox to the more spacious
Cow Palace, it lost a "door advantage" of six to eight points. Sure, it's the
same kind of hardwood, the baskets are the same distance from the floor,
and the rims are the same size on every court, so what's the difference
where they play? The difference is simply that the home team has the
psychological lift of having a supporting rooting section.
Thus, the Dcanmen's chances to win will increase in direct proportion to
ihe number of rabid rooters who ride, fly, swim, walk, or crawl to the two
games.
Coach Dean had this to say yesterday: "There is a recognized floor
advantage of from si\ to eight points. The transfer to the Cow Palace
was made in the interest of basketball—in letting more people, especially
alun.ni, see the classic. We hope Cal will reciprocate by moving their
home game to the Cow Palace next year. It will aid the team a lot to
have a strong rooting section there and at Berkeley on Saturday. A good
rooting section helps the leant more than the rooters realize."
Incidentally, be sure to get to the games early so you can see Stanford's
"best-ever" yearling team take care of the Cal frosh.
And so the Big Move is on. With white saddle shoes held high, banners
waving, and a Rally Com member tucked under each arm, it's off to the
basketball games.

pointed out yesterday, Stanford might have had a chance Saturday night

Among other things, Coach Everett Dean is working on control of the
backboards thi.s week. The insertion of Bill Stevenson (six foot six) into
the lineup can not be underestimated. Stevenson, along with Jim Ram

desperately need to whip Cal. Also look for some action from Bruce Iver
