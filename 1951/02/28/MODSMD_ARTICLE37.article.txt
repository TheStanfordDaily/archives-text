# Tucker, Hagler Will Vie For Runner-up in Scoring
## 
### 
The runner - up to UCLA's Dick .
Ridge way tor the Southern Division
scoring crown will be determined
during this weekend's cross - bay
hoop series when Stanford's Eddie
'1 ucker and the Bears' Bill Hagler
match shots in the Cow Palace Fri
day and at Berkeley Saturday night.
Tucker, at least, retains some
ch; nee of overhauling the Bruins'
sophomore star for top honors.
Ridgeway is currently pacing the di
vision hot-shots with a total of 186
point . followed by Tucker with 171
and Hi.gler with 159.
Hagler a Threat
The lanky (6-lt. 4-in. and 175
pounds) Hagler is the most consist- |
(nt sc. i ing threat in all Berkeley
In lory. Early last month he dropped ]
point number 1182 to surpass the
former fouivyear record held by leg- |
endary Andy Wolfe. Since then, lie's !
outdistanced the old mark by an ad- I
ditional ti2 points and is now eyeing 1
till another all-time Cal mark held i
by Wolfe.
The latif r is the three-year PCC
irin." K'ord of 495 points. Hagler
i.'l 2 point shy of that one and could
easily u .-'c!) the goal in the week's I
I Hales.
Tucker, on the other hand, can i
hardly < xpect to break any records
iii this;, his first year of play with the !
lied'.kins. But by connecting for 1G I
more against Cal than Ridgeway '
dm against USC, speedy Ed could j
steal t!if year's conference honors
from the L'CLA forward.
[,'!d!e Moves Up
Eddie picked up 14 tallies on
Ridgeway last weekend, mainly by |
virtue of his .'ll -point performance!
Saturday night.
Hagler has tarted at the center ii
■i 'H mo .1 of the year but might he
wil'herl to forward this week to
make loom for outsized sophomore \
(.'lay Gray. If the 6—ft. 7-in. Gray,
v/ho ha< been bothered by illness (
and iii juries all year, is inserted at :
eei, ei . Hagler will join John Rick- i
en at the forwards. John's identical
twin, Rupe, will go at one guard
; long with tricky Bob See.
Stanford mentor Everett Dean has
been ornewhat vague conerning his j
pi tbable starting five. But it seems ;
almo; t certain that the big four of
Jack O'Sullivan, Tucker, Jim Ram
stead, and Ji.n Walsh will get post
call: the final spot could go to any
of three Bruce Iversen, Bill Ste
venson, or Gary Andrews.
Saturday's game will be the final
Stanford appearance for O'Sullivan.

The runner - up to UCLA's Dick .
Ridge way tor the Southern Division
scoring crown will be determined
during this weekend's cross - bay
hoop series when Stanford's Eddie
'1 ucker and the Bears' Bill Hagler
match shots in the Cow Palace Fri
day and at Berkeley Saturday night.
Tucker, at least, retains some
ch; nee of overhauling the Bruins'
sophomore star for top honors.
Ridgeway is currently pacing the di
vision hot-shots with a total of 186
point . followed by Tucker with 171
and Hi.gler with 159.
Hagler a Threat
The lanky (6-lt. 4-in. and 175
pounds) Hagler is the most consist- |
(nt sc. i ing threat in all Berkeley
In lory. Early last month he dropped ]
point number 1182 to surpass the
former fouivyear record held by leg- |
endary Andy Wolfe. Since then, lie's !
outdistanced the old mark by an ad- I
ditional ti2 points and is now eyeing 1
till another all-time Cal mark held i
by Wolfe.
The latif r is the three-year PCC
irin." K'ord of 495 points. Hagler
i.'l 2 point shy of that one and could
easily u .-'c!) the goal in the week's I
I Hales.
Tucker, on the other hand, can i
hardly < xpect to break any records
iii this;, his first year of play with the !
lied'.kins. But by connecting for 1G I
more against Cal than Ridgeway '
dm against USC, speedy Ed could j
steal t!if year's conference honors
from the L'CLA forward.
