For the first time in the post-war
era, Stanford's track squad will field
a deep, well - balanced sprint team
that will rival any other sprint ag
gregation on the Coast.
Led by Ronnie Buck who came into
his own with a 9.7 hundred at Fres
no last season, the Card sprinters
are whipping into shape very fast
this year and will get their first big
test in the Long Beach Relays on
March 10.
Buck Teams Up in Relays
The v/ay it stands now in the 440
relay, Buck will team up with new
comer Maurice Parsons and veter
ans Wilbur Taylor (9.9) and Bob
Bryan (9.9). Parsons, leading frosh
sprinter last season, has improved
greatly in practices so far this year.
Only anchor man Gay Bryan will be
missing from the 440 team that won
a majority of its races last season.
Other leading contenders for
berths on the team include veteran
Jim Pollock, who doubles in the low
hurdles; sophomore Bob Magee, who
showed plenty of promise with Ray
Dean's frosh last year: and Jim Gal
lagher, a transfer from Stockton JC.
Taylor, who ran a very respectable
21.5 in the USC meet last season,
heads the list of 220-yard dashers
who will enter the 880-yard relay at
Long Beach. Buck and Bryan will
again team up with Taylor in this
relay event.
Fourth Spot Undecided
The fourth spot on the teem is as
vet undecided, but footballer Bill

Storum, who won a spot on the mile
relay team as a sophomore last year,
rates a slight edge.
Sophomore Bill Friedrichs, winner
of the thrilling freshman Big Meet
quarter mile, is shaping up fast, and
will give the Cards added strength in

both the furlong and quarter-mile
events.
The competition for the six sprint
starting berths in dual meets this
season looks to be very fierce.
Illy Leads Quarter-Milers
In the quarter-mile, fast-starting
Cas Bly leads a big group of pros
pects. Bly, who has run close to 50
flat already in practice, has an all
time best of 48.8, and from all indi
cations should have a good year.
The Cards will miss Captain Larry
Holf and Pitch Johnson in the 440,
but Bly. Storum, Taylor, and Fried
riehs among others leave Coach Jack
Weiershauser little to worry about
in this all-important event.
Half-milers Drew Terramorse and
Joss Scroggy have also turned in
some excellent times around the 50-
fiat mark in quarter-mile time trials
this season.
A quintet of half-milers, who all
have been timed around the two
minute mark in practice, hope to
make the 880 more than a mediocre
event this season.


TAKING A COUPLE OF LAPS—Ronnie Buck, Wilbur Taylor, and Maurice Parsons go for a
wind sprint as they work themselves into condition for the coming track season. Buck, who did
a 9.7 hundred last year, will team up with Taylor, Parsons, and Bob Bryan in the 440-yard relay.
Taylor has done 9.9 in the hundred and will be a mainstay on the Card track team. Parsons
was an outstanding cinderman on last year's frosh team and promises to bring in some points
for the Indians. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson

this season.

event this season.


TAKING A COUPLE OF LAPS—Ronnie Buck, Wilbur Taylor, and Maurice Parsons go for a
wind sprint as they work themselves into condition for the coming track season. Buck, who did
a 9.7 hundred last year, will team up with Taylor, Parsons, and Bob Bryan in the 440-yard relay.
Taylor has done 9.9 in the hundred and will be a mainstay on the Card track team. Parsons
was an outstanding cinderman on last year's frosh team and promises to bring in some points
for the Indians. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson

By DWIGHT WILBUR
For the first time in the post-war
era, Stanford's track squad will field
a deep, well - balanced sprint team
that will rival any other sprint ag
gregation on the Coast.
Led by Ronnie Buck who came into
his own with a 9.7 hundred at Fres
no last season, the Card sprinters
are whipping into shape very fast
this year and will get their first big
test in the Long Beach Relays on
March 10.
Buck Teams Up in Relays
The v/ay it stands now in the 440
relay, Buck will team up with new
comer Maurice Parsons and veter
ans Wilbur Taylor (9.9) and Bob
Bryan (9.9). Parsons, leading frosh
sprinter last season, has improved
greatly in practices so far this year.
Only anchor man Gay Bryan will be
missing from the 440 team that won
a majority of its races last season.
Other leading contenders for
berths on the team include veteran
Jim Pollock, who doubles in the low
hurdles; sophomore Bob Magee, who
showed plenty of promise with Ray
Dean's frosh last year: and Jim Gal
lagher, a transfer from Stockton JC.
Taylor, who ran a very respectable
21.5 in the USC meet last season,
heads the list of 220-yard dashers
who will enter the 880-yard relay at
Long Beach. Buck and Bryan will
again team up with Taylor in this
relay event.
Fourth Spot Undecided
The fourth spot on the teem is as
vet undecided, but footballer Bill

Storum, who won a spot on the mile
relay team as a sophomore last year,
rates a slight edge.
Sophomore Bill Friedrichs, winner
of the thrilling freshman Big Meet
quarter mile, is shaping up fast, and
will give the Cards added strength in

both the furlong and quarter-mile
events.
The competition for the six sprint
starting berths in dual meets this
season looks to be very fierce.
Illy Leads Quarter-Milers
In the quarter-mile, fast-starting
Cas Bly leads a big group of pros
pects. Bly, who has run close to 50
flat already in practice, has an all
time best of 48.8, and from all indi
cations should have a good year.
The Cards will miss Captain Larry
Holf and Pitch Johnson in the 440,
but Bly. Storum, Taylor, and Fried
riehs among others leave Coach Jack
Weiershauser little to worry about
in this all-important event.
Half-milers Drew Terramorse and
Joss Scroggy have also turned in
some excellent times around the 50-
fiat mark in quarter-mile time trials
this season.
