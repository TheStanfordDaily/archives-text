# Sadie Hawkins Comes to Farm
## 
### 
All the Farm coeds who've been
wondering where that next date is
coming from can take the matter
into their own hands next weekend
when Sadie Hawkins Day hits the
campus.
A girl-ask-boy dancc will be held
Friday, March 9, at Austin's Red
Barn down Bayshore Highway. Ad
mission will cost each Farm Sadie
(Hawkins, not Stanford) 25 cents
plus one penny per pound of girl.
