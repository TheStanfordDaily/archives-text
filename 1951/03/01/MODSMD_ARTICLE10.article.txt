# Lag Tree Trimming Causes Two Alarms
## 
### 
Fire engines responded to two alarms at Lagunita Hall yester
day, one at 10 a.m. and another at about 1:30 p.m., but there were
no fires.
Firemen rushed to the front of Lag at 10 a.m. to answer a false
alarm believed to have been caused when a branch fell against

the call box located there. Tree
trimmers were working nearby, and
the box was probably jarred by a
falling limb, Fire Chief John Marston
said.
The later alarm was set off by
electricians who had repaired a loose
connection in the box and were test
ing it.
False Alarms Risky
Falsc alarms since Jan. 1 now total
eight, Marston reported. This is
compared to 19 alarms of all kinds.
Commenting on the trouble .caused
by the false calls, the fire chief em
phasized the risk involved. 'More
firemen are killed spotting false
alarms than fighting fires, according
to statistics," he said.
Another danger is that a real fire
may break out while firemen arc
busy on a fake alarm. "And every
minute counts in this business,"
Marston added.
Must Clean Equipment
After every call—for a real fire or
not — the firemen must wash the
truck. This is necessary to keep the
equipment in top shape, Marston
explained. For example, their gear
was muddied when they answered
the call in yesterday morning's rain.

call box in front of Lagunita. First they responded when a branch fell against the call box as the
trees were being trimmed; then they came when electricians repairing the box caused a short
