# Baran Talks On Planning, Mobilization
## 
### 
Emergency mobilization tends to
make economic planning more feas
ible—so much so that the contro
versy about planning is becoming
not whether to plan or not, but for
what and by whom the planning will
be done.
These were the conclusions drawn
by Professor Paul A. Baran in yes
terday's lecture on mobilization, the
sixth in a series sponsored by the
Department of Economics.
Professor Baran explained that the
existence of large corporations
makes planning for war or for peace
easier—it is simply the superimpos
ing of central planning over partial
planning.
Big Business Favored
"The War Department cannot deal
with small firms," he said, declaring
that disposal of war assets also fa
vored big business.
Professor Baran analyzed the
cause of resistance to government
direction in World War 11, saying
that it was run by "civil servants and
long - haired professors" who were
"regarded as obnoxious" because
they were "too rational."
Obsolete Question
Appearing, as he said, "as the
apostle of peace," he pointed out that
the methods used in wartime could
be directed to extremely construc
tive rather than destructive ends. In
his opinion, the market-profit mech
anism has broken down; most of the
world now uses the planning meth
od, and soon the question of whether
there is a need or a possibility for
planning will become obsolete.
