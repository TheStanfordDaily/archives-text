# Opinion Poll Is Defeated By Excom
## 
### 
Excom last night voted down
a motion which would call for a
vote seeking student body opin
ion on the top candidates se
lected by the Rome Congress
Committee for Stanford's offi
cial delegate to the Rome Peace
Congress.
The poll, which would also have
sought opinions on whether or not a
delegate should be sent at all, was
defeated by a vote of five to one,
with five members abstaining.
At the same time, Excom approved
the request of Tom Bartlett, chair
man of the Rome Congress Commit
tee, to empower the committee to
solicit funds for financing the dele
gate's trip. The solicitations will be
made of off-campus groups only.
Approved Last Week
Last week, Excom approved the
committee's selecting an official del
egate subject to the approval of Ex
com, providing the cost to the ASSU
be no more than $100 and as long as
the delegate be suitable.
President Ted Buttner emphasized
that the point in sending a delegate
is the educational motive of having
the delegate report the transactions
of the Congress back to the Univer
sity and that Excom has not gone on
record as favoring the Congress it
self.
"Excom's Decision"
In voting down the proposed ref
erendum for student opinion, the
majority of voting members voiced
the opinion that the final decision
would still remain with Excom re
gardless, and for reasons of cost and
possible student misunderstanding
of the issue, the selection of the del
egate should rest solely with Excom.
In other business, Excom approved
unanimously an addition to the Elec
tion By-laws that "All candidates at
the time of their election must in
tend to be enrolled in the University
and to fill the office until the expira
tion of their full term."
This motion was voted on last
week but lacked the necessary three
fourths vote to make it a by-law.
Excom also approved unanimously
a request by Bill Gullickson and Bill
Sanson of Alpha Phi Omega, na
tional service fraternity, to allow A
Phi O to operate a book exchange
beginning next year.
Under the organization's plan, stu
dents would be able to exchange
their second - hand books through
the department to be set up and
manned by an A Phi O member.

Excom last night voted down
a motion which would call for a
vote seeking student body opin
ion on the top candidates se
lected by the Rome Congress
Committee for Stanford's offi
cial delegate to the Rome Peace
Congress.
The poll, which would also have
sought opinions on whether or not a
delegate should be sent at all, was
defeated by a vote of five to one,
with five members abstaining.
At the same time, Excom approved
the request of Tom Bartlett, chair
man of the Rome Congress Commit
tee, to empower the committee to
solicit funds for financing the dele
gate's trip. The solicitations will be
made of off-campus groups only.
Approved Last Week
Last week, Excom approved the
committee's selecting an official del
egate subject to the approval of Ex
com, providing the cost to the ASSU
be no more than $100 and as long as
the delegate be suitable.
President Ted Buttner emphasized
that the point in sending a delegate
is the educational motive of having
the delegate report the transactions
of the Congress back to the Univer
sity and that Excom has not gone on
record as favoring the Congress it
self.
"Excom's Decision"
In voting down the proposed ref
erendum for student opinion, the
majority of voting members voiced
the opinion that the final decision
would still remain with Excom re
gardless, and for reasons of cost and
possible student misunderstanding
of the issue, the selection of the del
egate should rest solely with Excom.
In other business, Excom approved
unanimously an addition to the Elec
tion By-laws that "All candidates at
the time of their election must in
tend to be enrolled in the University
and to fill the office until the expira
tion of their full term."
This motion was voted on last
week but lacked the necessary three
fourths vote to make it a by-law.
Excom also approved unanimously
a request by Bill Gullickson and Bill
Sanson of Alpha Phi Omega, na
tional service fraternity, to allow A
Phi O to operate a book exchange
beginning next year.
Under the organization's plan, stu
dents would be able to exchange
their second - hand books through
the department to be set up and
manned by an A Phi O member.
