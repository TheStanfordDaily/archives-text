# Snow in Foothills Attracts Students
## Some Look, Some Ski 
### 
A slushy snowfall in the foothills |
back of the campus brought a touch
of winter to the Stanford scene yes
terday.
Well over 100 Stanfordites forsook
the cold, driving rain and wind here |
and headed for the high areas around |
the Skyline Boulevard. Most of them I
went to "just look." Some went to j
throw snowballs; a few went to try i
their luck on skis in the one inch of
wet slush.
Four Theta Xi's drove to the hills J
above Saratoga where four to six J
inches of snow made actual skiing ;
possible. The foursome set up a j
small slalom run and built a ski J
jump where they were able to make '
leaps up to "15 feet."
The heaviest snowfall reported j
was 12 inches at the 1,808-foot sum
mit of the Los Gatos - Santa Cruz
hiqhway, some 20 miles southwest of (
campus.

A three-foot snowman even ap
peared here on the Row, but its
builders explained they cot the raw
materials at Skyline and packed it
here.
San Francisco got its first snow
ball-making snowfall since Dec. 31,
1941. It was officially recorded as a
trace, but kids flocked to the parks i
for snowball fights.
The San Francisco Chamber of i
Commerce received a sympathetic
telegram from the Seattle Chamber, i
but the Californians had a quick re- *
ply.
Seattle Sorry
"Scattleitcs deeply touched hy
news of your unusual weathrr. j
Please accept our best wishes. Sun
shining brightly here," rend the Se
attle wire.

"Condolcnccs appreciated but un
necessary. Snow as planned by our
Chamber for All - Industry Frozen
Food Convention now noing on here.
Convention ends tomorrow—so will

snow. Plan usual sunny day from
then on," the San Francisco answer
read.
The snow here was pood news for
skiers, as it heralded an extra long

season at California ski areas. The
Donner Summit Winter Sports Com
mittee predicted that the skiing sea
son would last until early May. New
snow has been falling weekly.


BABY, IT'S COLD—Skier Shirley Elder is trying to find out from Tom Peterson the best possi
ble way to descend to the campus from a hill along the Skyline. Ann Ramsay is waiting for their
decision, but she is also wondering if it would be advisable to try the feat with a skirt on instead
of regular ski pants. Hoover Tower is hidden by the clouds in the background.
