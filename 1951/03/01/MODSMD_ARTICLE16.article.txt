# All-Campus Civilian Defense Test Alert Set for Next Week
## Firehouse Whistle Blast To Give Danger Warning 
### 
An all-campus civilian defense test alert in which normal cam
pus activities will be temporarily disrupted will take place "some
time next week," according to Alf Brandin, commander-in-chief
of Stanford's civilian defense program.
Day and time of the alert are being kept secret to preserve the

surprise element and more closely
approximate a warning under actual
bombing conditions.
All campus traffic will be stopped,
except in the Palo Alto Hospital area,
and class lectures disrupted during
the "red" condition of the alert,
which should last about 15 minutes,
according to Brandin.
The entire alert will take about 25
minutes, the "yellow" (preparatory)
warning lasting approximately the
first 10 minutes.
Yellow Alert—One Long Blast
What will happen: The yellow
warning, which under actual condi
tions would mean unidentified planes
had been detected by radar and were
approaching this general area, will
be signaled by a single sustained
blast of a minute or more duration
from the Firehouse whistle.
During the yellow condition, cam
pus activity will continue normally,
except that traffic will stop.
A specific target area has been
named, where authorities will re
ceive sealed instructions to be opened
when the alert enters red stage,
which under actual conditions would
moan bombing appears imminent.
The instructions will contain the
extent of mock damage, number of
injured, extent of fire, etc., which
will be relayed to the Firehouse,
campus CD command center.
Command Center
Co-ordinators in the command
center will in turn relay the informa
tion to the appropriate departments
in the order of fire, medical, police,
public works, housing, and feeding.
The departments will then dis
patch personnel and equipment—
fire trucks, medical personnel and
stretchers, repair crews—to the tar
get area.
The ROTC will assist the police in
roping off the area, while the NROTC
and Air ROTC will assist the fire and
public utilities divisions respectively.
Housing and feeding divisions will
make plans to take care of "bombed
out" survivors.
Red Alert—Short Blasts
Red condition is to be signaled by
a series of short blasts of the Fire
house whistle repeated for three
minutes.
At this signal, lectures will stop,
faculty and students not connected
with CD are directed to face the
nearest wall away from window
areas.
All clear will be signaled by three
one-minute blasts of the whistle with
two-minute intervals.
What to do:
The following rules have been is
sued by Brandin and his deputies:
Under Yellow Alert
1. All civilian defense personnel
man their posts.
2. Faculty and students not con
nected with civilian defense organ
izations will continue their regu
lar activities.
3. All traffic to stop on campus
(except in Palo Alto Hospital area)
so that roads may he open for
movement of civilian defense per
sonnel.
4. Telephones will be used for
emergency purposes only so that
orders to and from the command

center will not be interrupted.
Under Red Alert
1. If you are inside, Ret away
from window areas and stand fac
ing a wall.
2. Hallways can be used as shel
ters, but a passageway must be
left open for easy exit.
3. Living groups will observe
their regular house rules covering
any type of disaster.
4. If you are outside, pet next to
a building for shielding purposes.
All Clear: Resume normal op
erations.
The rules are designed to apply
closely to actual bombing conditions.
Only differences are that in an ac
tual raid, those inside should lie flat,
face down against a wall, facing away
from outside light, to avoid the ef
fects of the bomb's blast.
Those caught outside should find
some type of shelter, lie flat and
cover exposed parts of the body with
anything available.
The rules were announced Tues
day night at a meeting of the "Big
Four" of campus civilian defense:
Brandin; Phillip G. Duffy, Stanford
purchasing agent; Thomas A. Spra
gens, assistant to the University

Auxiliary firemen are needed for
civilian defense. John Marston,
Stanford fire chief, reiterated the
need for these men and added that
he would like applications from
students living on campus who
would he here for some time, if
possible.

President; and Dr. Donald J. Gray,
professor of anatomy.
The announcement followed the
final division alerts for area wardens
and fire divisions, which took place
late last. week.
Brandin reported 100 per cent re
sponse to the alerts, which were
mainly personnel checks and further
indoctrination periods.
Stanford Village will not partici
pate in next week's alert since it falls
under the jurisdiction of San Mateo
County. The campus is an incor
porated civilian defense sub-division
under Santa Clara County, Brandin
explained.

fects of the bomb's blast.
Those caught outside should find
some type of shelter, lie flat and
cover exposed parts of the body with
anything available.
The rules were announced Tues
day night at a meeting of the "Big
Four" of campus civilian defense:
Brandin; Phillip G. Duffy, Stanford
purchasing agent; Thomas A. Spra
gens, assistant to the University

Auxiliary firemen are needed for
civilian defense. John Marston,
Stanford fire chief, reiterated the
need for these men and added that
he would like applications from
students living on campus who
would he here for some time, if
possible.

President; and Dr. Donald J. Gray,
professor of anatomy.
The announcement followed the
final division alerts for area wardens
and fire divisions, which took place
late last. week.
Brandin reported 100 per cent re
sponse to the alerts, which were
mainly personnel checks and further
indoctrination periods.
Stanford Village will not partici
pate in next week's alert since it falls
under the jurisdiction of San Mateo
County. The campus is an incor
porated civilian defense sub-division
under Santa Clara County, Brandin
explained.
An all-campus civilian defense test alert in which normal cam
pus activities will be temporarily disrupted will take place "some
time next week," according to Alf Brandin, commander-in-chief
of Stanford's civilian defense program.
Day and time of the alert are being kept secret to preserve the

surprise element and more closely
approximate a warning under actual
bombing conditions.
All campus traffic will be stopped,
except in the Palo Alto Hospital area,
and class lectures disrupted during
the "red" condition of the alert,
which should last about 15 minutes,
according to Brandin.
The entire alert will take about 25
minutes, the "yellow" (preparatory)
warning lasting approximately the
first 10 minutes.
Yellow Alert—One Long Blast
What will happen: The yellow
warning, which under actual condi
tions would mean unidentified planes
had been detected by radar and were
approaching this general area, will
be signaled by a single sustained
blast of a minute or more duration
from the Firehouse whistle.
During the yellow condition, cam
pus activity will continue normally,
except that traffic will stop.
A specific target area has been
named, where authorities will re
ceive sealed instructions to be opened
when the alert enters red stage,
which under actual conditions would
moan bombing appears imminent.
The instructions will contain the
extent of mock damage, number of
injured, extent of fire, etc., which
will be relayed to the Firehouse,
campus CD command center.
Command Center
Co-ordinators in the command
center will in turn relay the informa
tion to the appropriate departments
in the order of fire, medical, police,
public works, housing, and feeding.
The departments will then dis
patch personnel and equipment—
fire trucks, medical personnel and
stretchers, repair crews—to the tar
get area.
The ROTC will assist the police in
roping off the area, while the NROTC
and Air ROTC will assist the fire and
public utilities divisions respectively.
Housing and feeding divisions will
make plans to take care of "bombed
out" survivors.
Red Alert—Short Blasts
Red condition is to be signaled by
a series of short blasts of the Fire
house whistle repeated for three
minutes.
At this signal, lectures will stop,
faculty and students not connected
with CD are directed to face the
nearest wall away from window
areas.
All clear will be signaled by three
one-minute blasts of the whistle with
two-minute intervals.
What to do:
The following rules have been is
sued by Brandin and his deputies:
Under Yellow Alert

All campus traffic will be stopped,
except in the Palo Alto Hospital area,
and class lectures disrupted during
the "red" condition of the alert,
which should last about 15 minutes,
according to Brandin.
The entire alert will take about 25
minutes, the "yellow" (preparatory)
warning lasting approximately the
first 10 minutes.
Yellow Alert—One Long Blast
What will happen: The yellow
warning, which under actual condi
tions would mean unidentified planes
had been detected by radar and were
approaching this general area, will
be signaled by a single sustained
blast of a minute or more duration
from the Firehouse whistle.
During the yellow condition, cam
pus activity will continue normally,
except that traffic will stop.
A specific target area has been
named, where authorities will re
ceive sealed instructions to be opened
when the alert enters red stage,
which under actual conditions would
moan bombing appears imminent.
The instructions will contain the
extent of mock damage, number of
injured, extent of fire, etc., which
will be relayed to the Firehouse,
campus CD command center.
Command Center
Co-ordinators in the command
center will in turn relay the informa
tion to the appropriate departments
in the order of fire, medical, police,
public works, housing, and feeding.
The departments will then dis
patch personnel and equipment—
fire trucks, medical personnel and
stretchers, repair crews—to the tar
get area.
The ROTC will assist the police in
roping off the area, while the NROTC
and Air ROTC will assist the fire and
public utilities divisions respectively.
Housing and feeding divisions will
make plans to take care of "bombed
out" survivors.
Red Alert—Short Blasts
Red condition is to be signaled by
a series of short blasts of the Fire
house whistle repeated for three
minutes.
At this signal, lectures will stop,
faculty and students not connected
with CD are directed to face the
nearest wall away from window
areas.
All clear will be signaled by three
one-minute blasts of the whistle with
two-minute intervals.
What to do:
The following rules have been is
sued by Brandin and his deputies:
Under Yellow Alert
1. All civilian defense personnel
man their posts.
2. Faculty and students not con
nected with civilian defense organ
izations will continue their regu
lar activities.
3. All traffic to stop on campus
(except in Palo Alto Hospital area)
so that roads may he open for
movement of civilian defense per
sonnel.
4. Telephones will be used for
emergency purposes only so that
orders to and from the command

center will not be interrupted.
Under Red Alert
1. If you are inside, Ret away
from window areas and stand fac
ing a wall.
2. Hallways can be used as shel
ters, but a passageway must be
left open for easy exit.
3. Living groups will observe
their regular house rules covering
any type of disaster.
4. If you are outside, pet next to
a building for shielding purposes.
All Clear: Resume normal op
erations.
The rules are designed to apply
closely to actual bombing conditions.
Only differences are that in an ac
tual raid, those inside should lie flat,
face down against a wall, facing away
from outside light, to avoid the ef
fects of the bomb's blast.
Those caught outside should find
some type of shelter, lie flat and
cover exposed parts of the body with
anything available.
The rules were announced Tues
day night at a meeting of the "Big
Four" of campus civilian defense:
Brandin; Phillip G. Duffy, Stanford
purchasing agent; Thomas A. Spra
gens, assistant to the University

Auxiliary firemen are needed for
civilian defense. John Marston,
Stanford fire chief, reiterated the
need for these men and added that
he would like applications from
students living on campus who
would he here for some time, if
possible.

President; and Dr. Donald J. Gray,
professor of anatomy.
The announcement followed the
final division alerts for area wardens
and fire divisions, which took place
late last. week.
Brandin reported 100 per cent re
sponse to the alerts, which were
mainly personnel checks and further
indoctrination periods.
Stanford Village will not partici
pate in next week's alert since it falls
under the jurisdiction of San Mateo
County. The campus is an incor
porated civilian defense sub-division
under Santa Clara County, Brandin
explained.
An all-campus civilian defense test alert in which normal cam
pus activities will be temporarily disrupted will take place "some
time next week," according to Alf Brandin, commander-in-chief
of Stanford's civilian defense program.
Day and time of the alert are being kept secret to preserve the

surprise element and more closely
approximate a warning under actual
bombing conditions.
