# To Our Letter-Writers
## 
### 
Whenever a controversial issue such as the
Rome trip hits this campus, a covey of irate,
sarcastic, and unconstructive letter writers
makes a beeline for the Daily Shack loaded
down with bombastic missives.
We don't mind the writers' irate feelings.
The very purpose of "Campus Opinion" is to
air both sides of a question — provided both
sides are propounded in a manner that is
neither libelous, obscene, or unconstructive.
However, in the past week the Daily has seen
fit to cut, edit, and in some cases omit entirely
certain letters we felt were of the unprintable
variety.
In addition, we have purposely neglected to
publish those letters which appeared by
weight of evidence to have been signed fic
titiously. The reasons for this are obvious.
We would like to think that everyone con
nected with Stanford is aware of the meaning

of the term "constructive." To level a verbal
blast at an Excom member or members simply
for the sake of being sarcastic or practicing the
so-called "art" of turning out biting phrase
ology (which means absolutely nothing) is in
fantile.
Accusations, opinions, and statements of
fact are fine —provided an attempt is made to
verify them either through logic (common
sense) or additional facts that can be substan
tiated.
Only if those whose letters appear in "Cam
pus Opinion" will put some effort into their
compositions and make an honest attempt to
know whereof they speak, will the column be
of any service to the student body.
One more thing: In the future, we would ap
preciate letters that are accurately signed and
include, if possible, an address where the
writer can be reached.
