### DICK McLEAN 
My Room Mate ami My Toothbrush

You ask me why I'm carrying my toothbrush in my
pocket. Well, to understand that you have to under
stand my roommate. And that's a real story.
You sec, he's not a bad guy, don't get me wrong,
he's just got his minor flaws like the rest of us. We
call him Nugget because he shot the rapids of the
Yukon River when he "decided to leave" Stanford
after his heroic part in the "Glorious Riot of 1947."
That was the paiamarino that ended pajaniarinos
and there was some business about Nugget invading
itohle single-handed and a student policeman that
got kicked down a flight of stairs and a few other
things. Well anyway, Nugget is my roommate.
Some say that Nug never really left the Yukon. His
usual attire when he got back was an uncombed head
of k hair, a stubble blond beard, a heavy-weave shirt, a
pair of Levis, and bare feet in beat moccasins. Some
say that his values shifted in the land of Dangerous
Dan McGreW and the Lady known as Lou. When Nug
did return to us, he had changed. The great woods
had given him a sense of ruggedness we had never
seen in him before. Well anyway, Nugget is my room
mate.
And what a roommate! No sheets on Nug's bed. He
"likes to feel the hard wool against his body." Often

I find an open, eaten, can of cold beans on my desk.
Nug says they have real nourishment. The ants ap
pear to share Nug's opinion. They come clomping in
late at night and keep both of us awake. Sometimes
they even carry the can off.
Though he is a staunch believer in the capitalistic
system, he practices communism as a roommate.
What was Nug's was mine and vice-versa. If I wanted
to wear his moccasins with the hole in the left instep,
that was okay. If he wanted to wear my white shirts,
T-shirts, socks, or tuxedo, that was okay, too. I pro
vided the hair oil, razor blades, soap, and shaving
brush. Nug provided the toothpaste. Funny, we had
different toothpaste every day.
One morning in the shower, (Nug took showers)
he immortalized himself with the casual remark,
"Who took that blue wash rag that's been in here all
quarter?"
But gosh, I don't know what I'm going to do now.
You see Nug is my roommate and what's mine is his
and vice-versa like I sa>d before. But yesterday
morning Nug's toothbrush fell apart. And he's a real
good guy and he tells good stories about the Yukon
but. . . .
That's why I'm walking around Quad with my
toothbrush in my pocket. You see?

pear to share Nug's opinion. They come clomping in
late at night and keep both of us awake. Sometimes
they even carry the can off.
Though he is a staunch believer in the capitalistic
system, he practices communism as a roommate.
What was Nug's was mine and vice-versa. If I wanted
to wear his moccasins with the hole in the left instep,
that was okay. If he wanted to wear my white shirts,
T-shirts, socks, or tuxedo, that was okay, too. I pro
vided the hair oil, razor blades, soap, and shaving
brush. Nug provided the toothpaste. Funny, we had
different toothpaste every day.
One morning in the shower, (Nug took showers)
he immortalized himself with the casual remark,
"Who took that blue wash rag that's been in here all
quarter?"
But gosh, I don't know what I'm going to do now.
You see Nug is my roommate and what's mine is his
and vice-versa like I sa>d before. But yesterday
morning Nug's toothbrush fell apart. And he's a real
good guy and he tells good stories about the Yukon
but. . . .
That's why I'm walking around Quad with my
toothbrush in my pocket. You see?
My Room Mate ami My Toothbrush

You ask me why I'm carrying my toothbrush in my
pocket. Well, to understand that you have to under
stand my roommate. And that's a real story.
You sec, he's not a bad guy, don't get me wrong,
he's just got his minor flaws like the rest of us. We
call him Nugget because he shot the rapids of the
Yukon River when he "decided to leave" Stanford
after his heroic part in the "Glorious Riot of 1947."
That was the paiamarino that ended pajaniarinos
and there was some business about Nugget invading
itohle single-handed and a student policeman that
got kicked down a flight of stairs and a few other
things. Well anyway, Nugget is my roommate.
Some say that Nug never really left the Yukon. His
usual attire when he got back was an uncombed head
of k hair, a stubble blond beard, a heavy-weave shirt, a
pair of Levis, and bare feet in beat moccasins. Some
say that his values shifted in the land of Dangerous
Dan McGreW and the Lady known as Lou. When Nug
did return to us, he had changed. The great woods
had given him a sense of ruggedness we had never
seen in him before. Well anyway, Nugget is my room
mate.
And what a roommate! No sheets on Nug's bed. He
"likes to feel the hard wool against his body." Often

I find an open, eaten, can of cold beans on my desk.
Nug says they have real nourishment. The ants ap
pear to share Nug's opinion. They come clomping in
late at night and keep both of us awake. Sometimes
they even carry the can off.
