## Shampoo Case Opens Friday

Shampoo" dispute, involving hair

The hearing, which is open to the
public, is expected to result in legal
fireworks according to reports of
counsel for both disputants.
Miss Reilly asserted in a statement
to the press yesterday that she saw
the advertisements of the shampoo
in many leading magazines. These
advertisements displayed a picture
of Miss Lure under the words "Al

letters at the bottom of each page

but was dismissed on a motion from
lawyers for Miss Lure.
