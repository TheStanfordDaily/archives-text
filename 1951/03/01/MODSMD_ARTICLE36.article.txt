# Horsehiders to Battle USF
## Untested Dons Give Cards Chance for Scalping Today 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Those Alphonse and Gaston teams of collegiate baseball—USF |
and Stanford —will attempt once again to give each other the ball
game when they meet this afternoon at 3:15 on the Sunken Dia- |
mond.
Although outwardly they may admit to no such intended gen- j

erosity, Stanford and the Dons have
split more baseball series than An
derson has peas. And last year was
no exception, with each team emerg
ing victorious once from the "You
win this one, I'll take the next one"
act, which is getting to be as annual
an affair as Gaieties.
The Hilltoppers may not have the
best players around, but they cer
tainly have the distinction of having
the hardest names to spell, much less
pronounce. For instance, there's
Scarpelli, Mutto, Rozelle, and Tholl
ander. But get this one, Mr. Printer.

It's none other than Wally Dawid
czick, a pitcher, no less.
One Outing
In their only outing thus far. the
Dons defeated the Boston Braves
Rookies, an aggregation which
pitched an infielder and an outfielder
in defeating the locals. Strong point
for USF is their one-two pitching
punch of Don Townsend and Bob
Thollander, who are expected to
share hurling duties here unless the
Hilltoppers get mad at the scorers
and put in Dawidczick.
Big hitters for the Dons are Len
Karp at first, Gene Jacobs in right,
and Ed Rommel at third. And if past
history means anything, the Dons
won't be frightened by the usually
terrifying distances of the Sunken
Diamond. Right now they have hit
as many out of there as have the I
Stanfords—a whole three.
No Ilain, A Game
Unless Jupe Pluvius turns the field
into something rivaling Lake Lag,
Pitchers Joe Chez and Jim Claypool
will hurl for Stanford. They'll be j
throwing to Bill Herron and Yogi
Corzine, who, like whiskey, is getting I
better with age.
Hal Hennacy, the Arthur Murray i
of the initial sack, and Jim Casta- j
gnoli, of the initial sack, will handle |
first. Of late, Jim Cas has shown ]
more fire than a Mexican hot dog.
Jim Agar and Jack Shepard, a pair j
of hard-hitting sophomores will !
share right-field duties, iand Dick :
Cole and Tom Shaw will see service j
at third.

Those Alphonse and Gaston teams of collegiate baseball—USF |
and Stanford —will attempt once again to give each other the ball
game when they meet this afternoon at 3:15 on the Sunken Dia- |
mond.
Although outwardly they may admit to no such intended gen- j

erosity, Stanford and the Dons have
split more baseball series than An
derson has peas. And last year was
no exception, with each team emerg
ing victorious once from the "You
win this one, I'll take the next one"
act, which is getting to be as annual
an affair as Gaieties.
The Hilltoppers may not have the
best players around, but they cer
tainly have the distinction of having
the hardest names to spell, much less
pronounce. For instance, there's
Scarpelli, Mutto, Rozelle, and Tholl
ander. But get this one, Mr. Printer.

It's none other than Wally Dawid
czick, a pitcher, no less.
One Outing
In their only outing thus far. the
Dons defeated the Boston Braves
Rookies, an aggregation which
pitched an infielder and an outfielder
in defeating the locals. Strong point
for USF is their one-two pitching
punch of Don Townsend and Bob
Thollander, who are expected to
share hurling duties here unless the
Hilltoppers get mad at the scorers
and put in Dawidczick.
Big hitters for the Dons are Len
Karp at first, Gene Jacobs in right,
and Ed Rommel at third. And if past
history means anything, the Dons
won't be frightened by the usually
terrifying distances of the Sunken
Diamond. Right now they have hit
as many out of there as have the I
Stanfords—a whole three.
No Ilain, A Game
Unless Jupe Pluvius turns the field
into something rivaling Lake Lag,
Pitchers Joe Chez and Jim Claypool
will hurl for Stanford. They'll be j
throwing to Bill Herron and Yogi
Corzine, who, like whiskey, is getting I
better with age.
Hal Hennacy, the Arthur Murray i
of the initial sack, and Jim Casta- j
gnoli, of the initial sack, will handle |
first. Of late, Jim Cas has shown ]
more fire than a Mexican hot dog.
Jim Agar and Jack Shepard, a pair j
of hard-hitting sophomores will !
share right-field duties, iand Dick :
Cole and Tom Shaw will see service j
at third.
