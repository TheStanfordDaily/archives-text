## Midweek Musings

Any coach, or spectator for that matter, will confide that one of the most
potent attributes an athelete can possess is the ability to relax, to "stay
loose" during competition. But a yarn which emanated irom last Saturday's
Stanford-Moffat Mantecas baseball game at the Sunken Diamond causes us i
to wonder if this line of thought can't be carried too far.
The tale concerns Ted Jennings, a former San Francisco PCL performer
who currently cavorts at third base for the Mantecas. Jennings, perched
on second base in the filth inning at a time when his team was lour runs
behind and needed tallies desperately, beckoned Card second-sacker Art
Ahrahamson to the base.
Art ambled over, naturally expecting Jennings to make some wry com
ment pertinent to the diamond doings—an epithet for the umpires, perhaps,
or maybe an observation as to the quality of the Stanford pitching.
But when Ahrahamson reached Jenning, he noticed that the ex-Seal was
holding a handful of the Sunken Diamond turf in his hand. Jennings ran
the dirt through his fingers, looked up at Ahrahamson, and said, "Mighty
good soil you have here. Don't know where I could get some for my garden, i
do you?"
A QUICK DASH AROUND THE CIRCUIT . . . Although the only issue j
to be settled by the Indians and Bears in their hoop double-header this I
weekend is the matter of the division cellar occupancy, the twin bill stacks
up as a red-hot attraction from the fans' viewpoint. For one thing, the two
squads are extremely evenly matched; again, both are capable of top-rank
basketball. Witness the Cal-LIU and the Stanford-Bradley melees.
Then add the scoring duel between Eddie Tucker and Bill Ilagler, which
will decide the second place in the division scoring race, and you have the
ingredients of a mighty tasty hardwood dish. . . .
Santa Clara recently picked off one of the ripest fruits of this year's prep
crop when Stockton's Dick Garibaldi registered at the lower Peninsula [
school. As a quarterback Garibaldi was named on the high school All-
American team, the All-Northern California squad, and is a top-Hight bas
keteer at either forward or center. . . .
Chuck Taylor is currently involved in one of the most extensive speaking
series ever undertaken by a Stanford grid coach. Taylor will address alumni
groups all the way from Spokane and Seattle to Los Angeles in a total ol 11
engagements. The tour should inspire more alumni support than the Farm
has ever known—a factor which could be more than a little noticeable on
the turf of the Stanford Stadium in the years to come. . . .
Ever hear of a time and motion study in athletics? Freshman baseball
coach Bill Allhousc is applying the methods of industrial engineering to
diamond play this year, and the results could well be of national import.
It all started when the New York Yankees adopted a new style of fielding
grounders to the outfield. The classic method, for a righthander fielding a ,
ball to his left, is to pivot to the right before pegging to the infield. Then ■
Casey Stengel popped up with the contention that the outfielder could make
a faster, harder throw by pivoting all the way around to the left before
throwing. The Yanks used the new style all year; and it couldn't have done
much harm—they won the World's Champonship.
In any event. Everett Dean and Allhouse decided to conduct a thorough,
scientific investigation of the subject, which they will do starting tomorrow.
Such lads as Dick Clegg. Chuck Essegian; "Jack Shepard, and frosh Joe Miller
will be the subjects. Their throwing times will be clocked with a stop
watch, and the variations in accuracy, power, and distance between the two
styles will be measured.
So, if in passing the Frosh Field, you notice the chalked circles, diagonal
guide lines, and stop-watch timers, and conclude that the field appears
more of a laboratory than a baseball diamond—you'll be right.

Chuck Taylor is currently involved in one of the most extensive speaking
series ever undertaken by a Stanford grid coach. Taylor will address alumni
groups all the way from Spokane and Seattle to Los Angeles in a total ol 11
engagements. The tour should inspire more alumni support than the Farm
has ever known—a factor which could be more than a little noticeable on
the turf of the Stanford Stadium in the years to come. . . .
Ever hear of a time and motion study in athletics? Freshman baseball
coach Bill Allhousc is applying the methods of industrial engineering to
diamond play this year, and the results could well be of national import.
It all started when the New York Yankees adopted a new style of fielding
grounders to the outfield. The classic method, for a righthander fielding a ,
ball to his left, is to pivot to the right before pegging to the infield. Then ■
Casey Stengel popped up with the contention that the outfielder could make
a faster, harder throw by pivoting all the way around to the left before
throwing. The Yanks used the new style all year; and it couldn't have done
much harm—they won the World's Champonship.
In any event. Everett Dean and Allhouse decided to conduct a thorough,
scientific investigation of the subject, which they will do starting tomorrow.
Such lads as Dick Clegg. Chuck Essegian; "Jack Shepard, and frosh Joe Miller
will be the subjects. Their throwing times will be clocked with a stop
watch, and the variations in accuracy, power, and distance between the two
styles will be measured.
So, if in passing the Frosh Field, you notice the chalked circles, diagonal
guide lines, and stop-watch timers, and conclude that the field appears
more of a laboratory than a baseball diamond—you'll be right.
Any coach, or spectator for that matter, will confide that one of the most
potent attributes an athelete can possess is the ability to relax, to "stay
loose" during competition. But a yarn which emanated irom last Saturday's
Stanford-Moffat Mantecas baseball game at the Sunken Diamond causes us i
to wonder if this line of thought can't be carried too far.
The tale concerns Ted Jennings, a former San Francisco PCL performer
who currently cavorts at third base for the Mantecas. Jennings, perched
on second base in the filth inning at a time when his team was lour runs
behind and needed tallies desperately, beckoned Card second-sacker Art
Ahrahamson to the base.
Art ambled over, naturally expecting Jennings to make some wry com
ment pertinent to the diamond doings—an epithet for the umpires, perhaps,
or maybe an observation as to the quality of the Stanford pitching.
But when Ahrahamson reached Jenning, he noticed that the ex-Seal was
holding a handful of the Sunken Diamond turf in his hand. Jennings ran
the dirt through his fingers, looked up at Ahrahamson, and said, "Mighty
good soil you have here. Don't know where I could get some for my garden, i
do you?"
A QUICK DASH AROUND THE CIRCUIT . . . Although the only issue j
to be settled by the Indians and Bears in their hoop double-header this I
weekend is the matter of the division cellar occupancy, the twin bill stacks
up as a red-hot attraction from the fans' viewpoint. For one thing, the two
squads are extremely evenly matched; again, both are capable of top-rank
basketball. Witness the Cal-LIU and the Stanford-Bradley melees.
Then add the scoring duel between Eddie Tucker and Bill Ilagler, which
will decide the second place in the division scoring race, and you have the
ingredients of a mighty tasty hardwood dish. . . .
