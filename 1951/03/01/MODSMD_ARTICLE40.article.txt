## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's undefeated rugby team will meet its toughest oppo
sition of the season, when they tangle with California's undefeated
Bears up at Berkeley this afternoon. Cal boasts a 2-0 record, hav
ing downed the Olympic Club, 6 to 0 and UCLA, 23 to 0.
The Bears are big, rough, and have plenty of experience. Only

j won previous letters in rugby. Big
gun is Max Howell, a star back for ;
the famed Australian Wallabies, now j
playing his second year of rugby for |
Cal.

also be in the backfield. Saines was
first string fullback for the Thunder
birds from British Columbia last year

i
but is currently playing wing for the |
Bears.
For strength in the scrum, the j
Bears will be counting heavily on j
the Witter brothers, Bob and George.
They are of a long line of Witters
who have played football and rugby
at Cal since 1912. Also helping out
will be big Les Richter, Ail-Ameri
can guard, and two-year rugby vet
eran.

sition of the season, when they tangle with California's undefeated
Bears up at Berkeley this afternoon. Cal boasts a 2-0 record, hav
ing downed the Olympic Club, 6 to 0 and UCLA, 23 to 0.
The Bears are big, rough, and have plenty of experience. Only

j won previous letters in rugby. Big
gun is Max Howell, a star back for ;
the famed Australian Wallabies, now j
playing his second year of rugby for |
Cal.
Another transfer, Bill Saines, will '
also be in the backfield. Saines was
first string fullback for the Thunder
birds from British Columbia last year

i
but is currently playing wing for the |
Bears.
For strength in the scrum, the j
Bears will be counting heavily on j
the Witter brothers, Bob and George.
They are of a long line of Witters
who have played football and rugby
at Cal since 1912. Also helping out
will be big Les Richter, Ail-Ameri
can guard, and two-year rugby vet
eran.
