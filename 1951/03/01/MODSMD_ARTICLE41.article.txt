# Cagers Work Light for Cal
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketeers, pre
paring for the season's final week
end of play against California, went
through a very light workout in the
Pavilion yesterday afternoon, Coach
Everett Dean working on the prin
ciple that "if we're not in shape now,
we never will be."
Meanwhile, Cal Coach Nibs Price
announced across the Bay that he
will stick to the lineup that so nearly
upset UCLA in Westwood Saturday
night. That will mean Bill Hagler
will open at center, John Kicksen
and Larry Horan will be at forward,
with Bob See and Rupe P»icksen at
guards.
Friday night's game is slated for
8:30 at the Cow Palace, Saturday's
curtain-dropper for 8:30 p.m. at Ber
keley's Men's Gym.
The two teams have each won
three, lost seven, in Division compe
tition. One of the two will be forced
to make a clean sweep of the double
header in order to gain a clear title
to third place.
