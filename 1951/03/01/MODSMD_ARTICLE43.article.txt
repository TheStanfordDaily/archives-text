# Carillon Honors Herbert Hoover
## $100,000 Bells Given To Stanford by Belgium 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
One hundred thousand dollars' worth of music weighing 18.000
pounds hangs from the top of Hoover Tower. This small fortune
and massive weight comprises Stanford's 35-bell carillon.
Although Europeans have been using them for centuries, ca
rillons are relatively new to American music. The first one in this

country was installed in Gloucester,
Mass., in 1922.
Stanford's carillon was dedicated
June 20, 1941. Given to the Hoover
Library by the Belgian - American
Educational Foundation, it was in
recognition of Herbert Hoover's re
lief work in Belgium during and af
ter the First World War.
The bells were cast by Marcel Mi
chiels in Tournai, Belgium, in 1938.
In New York World's Fair
Before its journey to Stanford, the
carillon was part of the Belgian pa
vilion in the New York World's Fair
of 1939-40.
The largest bell, bearing the in
scription "I ring only for peace,"
weighs 1,500 pounds. The other 34
bells scale down to the smallest,
which weighs an insignificant 12 to
15 pounds.
The bell room, measuring 20 feet
square and about 18 feet in height,
occupies the center of the tower's
sightseeing platform. The bells arc
suspended from beams and arranged
in tiers.
Steel wires, attached to the bell
clappers, run down to the room be
low and hook onto the keyboard.
Distinguished Keyboard
The keyboard is the carillon's most
distinguished feature and looks like
a 300 - year - old version of "The
Thing."
It was built and installed by Ka
miel Lefevere, a world-famous ca
rillonneur, and modeled after a key
board in his native Belgium. Unfor
tunately, the model happened to be
300 years old.
The keyboard consists of two rows
of wooden pegs extending horizon
tally, and a row of foot pedals. Each
of the pegs and pedals is attached to
a steel wire. When a peg is struck,
the wire jerks the clapper against
the bell.
The pegs must be struck with a
closed fist to ring each note, and
striking several notes a second is a
muscle-taxer.
It is on this keyboard that Stan

ford carillonneur Ronald Barnes j
takes his weekly dozen. Each Sun- j
day he ascends the tower and works i
up a sweat between 1:30 and 2 p.m.
Barnes is a graduate student ma
joring in music. He played the ca
rillon in Lincoln, Neb., for two years
before taking a lesson, then he spent
a summer in Ottawa, Canada, study
ing nothing but the carillon.
He has been Stanford's carillon
neur since last September.
Because no two carillons are alike
and the tone of no two bells is alike,
carillon music cannot be bought on
the open market.
Each piece must be arranged by
the player and it can only be played
on the one carillon.
Arrangements are made over a pe
riod of time, Barnes said. Changes
utilizing the special tones of each
bell are made with each playing of
a piece, so that an arrangement may
not become final for weeks or even
months.
500 Arrangements
At present Barnes has about 500
arrangements, all of which he made
himself.
A modern keyboard is not radi
cally different from the one at Stan
ford, according to Barnes.
A new keyboard would have long
er pegs and more distance between
the keyboard and the foot pedals.
Now there is always the chance of
hands and knees getting mixed up in
a general free-for-all.
A new keyboard would also have
felt padding to stop the noise. Each
key wheezes, squeaks, and then
snorts when struck.
Now Being Repaired
Although a new keyboard doesn't
seem likely, the carillon is now get
ting its first set of repairs. New
stainless steel wires arc being in
stalled and the bells are being tight
ened to the beams.
Barnes said he gets almost no re
action from the carillon playing. The
remark he prizes most is one that
was overheard by a friend while
Barnes was sweating at the key
board.
Two roughs stepped out of Encina
while the carillon was playing. After
looking at each other quizzically for
a moment, one remarked:
"It sounds like he got potted last
night and hasn't gotten over it yet."

his knuckles on this keyboard every Sunday. The keyboard, a
musician's version of "The Thing," was modeled after a 300-
year-old keyboard in Belgium. -—Photo by A 1 McCombs
