# Encina Picks Dance Theme
## 
### 
Choosing "Evening in Paris" as
the theme, Encina social chairmen
are laying plans for the freshmen
only Encina Formal to be held
March 10 from 9 to 1 in the Encina
lounge.
Following the French street cafe
motif, the lounge will be transformed
into a Paris street with a fountain in
the center. Along the walls, a row of
shrubbery will separate the dance
floor from small tables. Gaily col
ored awnings will further the effect.
Bob Rodof, president of the social
chairmen, has announced that Bert
Whiting and his orchestra will play
for the dance. Bids for $1 can be
obtained by freshmen through their
wing social chairmen. Toyon, OfT-
Campus, and Village men are to con
tact Gordon Dickie, ticket chairman
at Encina.
