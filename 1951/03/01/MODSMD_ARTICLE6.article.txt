WASHINGTONâ€”The Atomic En
ergy Commission assured Congress
today that the nation's rapidly ex
panding A-bomb plants will get all
the uranium ore they need "for the
next two or three years."
The assurance came as the AEC
moved to increase the long - range
supply of the vital atomic raw mate
rial by offering sharply higher prices
and bonuses of up to $.'35,000 for new
strikes of low-grade domestic ura
nium ores.
