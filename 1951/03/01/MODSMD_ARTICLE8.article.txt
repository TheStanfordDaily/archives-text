# Eddy Concert 'Surprisingly Good,' Varied
## 
### CHRIS KEITH 
Nelson Eddy's benefit concert, held
last night at the Memorial Audito
rium, was surprisingly good. The
program was varied and interesting;
Mr. Eddy sang most of the numbers
quite well.
We were always aware that Mr.
Eddy could sing "Mammy's Little
Baby" with competence, if not dis
tinction. But we were a little skep
tical, until last night, of his abilities
as a concert performer.
He began with "Uditc, udite, o
rustici" from Donizetti's "L'Elisir
d'Amore," and then sang various ex
cellent selections from the classical
composers, in particular Mendels
sohn's beautiful "Auf Flugelcn des
Gesanges," Brahm's "Minnelied,"
and Godard's "L'Amour."
The quality of his voice was a little
nasal throughout these works, but
the performance was nevertheless
quite fine.
Perhaps Mr. Eddy's most effective
pieces were the ones requiring stage
presence and acting ability.
"Fur Funzehn Pfennigc," by Rich
ard Strauss, a humorous song about
a mercenary love affair in which the
man turns out to have only 15 cents;
"The Lord Chancellor's Insomnia,"
by Gilbert and Sullivan; and two of
the encores, a folk song, "The Frog
Went a-Courting" and, as you might
have guessed, "Mammy's Little Baby
Loves Short'ning Bread," were all
delightful, and very well received.
The size of the crowd was disap
pointing, being some four or five
hundred seats short of a sell - out.
The proceeds were to be sent to the
University of Dcllii; but. there is
some doubt whether there will be
any proceeds at all.
But what crowd there was re
ceived Mr, Eddy enthusiastically.
All in all, he received ten encores,
and throughout the performance
stopped many times to talk to the
audience explaining the songs, and
giving personal reminiscences. He
ended his encores with several songs
from his movies, such as "Rose Ma
rie" and "Indian Love Call."
Before the intermission, Theodore
Paxson, Mr. Eddy's accompanist,
played three piano solos, three sel
dom heard works, the best of which
was a Gavotte and Musette by Eu
gen d'Albert.
The concert as a whole was ex
tremely successful. The selections
were unpretentious, but without ex
ception very interesting, as, for ex
ample, the vocal arrangement of
Saint-Saens' "Dance Macabre."
