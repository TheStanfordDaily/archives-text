# Bryan Says Tito-Stalin Break Final
## 
### 
"I think the split between Tito and
Stalin Is a very real one; I do not
believe there will be a renewal of al
legiance between the two."
With these words, Julicn Bryan,
executive director of the Interna
tional Film Foundation in New York,
concluded his film-lecture on "Tito
and Yugoslavia" in Cubbcrley Audi
torium yesterday afternoon.
Shot 15,000 Feet of Film
Bryan returned to this country late
last year after spending seven weeks
in the mountains, cities, factories,
and homes of Yugoslavia, where he
and a crew of three shot 15,000 feet
of color film "and were only ar
rested once."
The documentary film expert, who
has recorded picture-stories of at
least a dozen countries throughout
the world, said the Yugoslav govern
ment was not only favorable to
camera-toting Americans, but "to our
country as a whole."
Yugoslavs Appreciate
Describing a film sequence in
which an elderly Yugoslav couple is
pictured happily receiving a "CARE"
package, Bryan told his audience
that the people in the southern Eu
ropean country "are just like we are
—appreciative, easy to talk to, and
surprisingly free in their criticism of
their own government."
Final scenes in the hour-long
documentary showed close-ups of
Marshal Tito, his seven-man cabinet,
and his military staff in their of
fices. Bryan said he is one of the few
cameramen who makes a practice of
carrying lighting equipment with
him and shooting "indoors as well as
outdoors."
Industrially Ambitious
He said Tito and his people are "al
most. too ambitious industrially," and
have exported food to such an extent
that, without American aid, wide
spread revolution might h. s ve re
sulted from poverty and malnutri
tion.
He said Tito "is on his own and
free of Stalin ... is on the American
side . . . and has one of the toughest
little armies in Europe."
Bryan will turn eastward shortly
to show his documentaries in Car
negie Hall and various eastern uni
versities.
