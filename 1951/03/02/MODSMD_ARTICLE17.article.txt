# SAB to Discuss Budget Tomorrow
## 
### 
A preliminary discussion of the
1951-52 athletic budget will high
light tomorrow's meeting of the
nine-man Stanford Athletic Board
at 10 a.m. in the University Presi
dent's office.
It is expected that next year's final
budget outlay will approximate this
year's figure, which was $525,000.
A probable item on tomorrow's
agenda will be a report by alumni
Board member Reg Caughey on a
revision of the present system of
distributing Big Game tickets to
alumni. Buck of the Month Club
members, and others.
A number of letters were received
following last year's Big Game
charging maldistribution of the tick
etsâ€”especially to members of the
Alumni Association.
