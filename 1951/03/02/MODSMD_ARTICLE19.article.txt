T. A. Spragens and Dr. Donald
Gray, three and four in the chain of
campus civil defense command, will
"run the show" from the campus
command center, the Firehouse, dur
ing next week's mock bombing alert.
This announcement was made by
Alf Brandin, University business
manager and head of civil defense on
campus, who said he and Phillip
Duffy, who would normally take con
trol, will perform district warden
checks and act as general observers
to give Spragens and Gray experi

Spragens is assistant to the Uni

Duffy, civil defense chief of staff,
meanwhile urged students and fac

the rules to be followed during the
alert, and with their districts and
wardens, a list of which will be
printed in Monday's Daily.
A release from the State Office of
Civil Defense reports that a Stanford
