### DEAN HOLMAN 
Not counting birds and air
planes, there are at least 2,280
j tons of chemicals taking to the
; air over Los Angeles daily,
' which are cumulatively well-
I known to the residents of the
I Southern California area as
i smog.
Of the total materials put into the
I air each day. 60 per cent come from
! the activities of the general public.
I All the industries of the county ac
j count for the remaining 40 per cent.
Tlie.sc major conclusions on Los
Angeles smog were announced rc
j cently by the Stanford Research In
| stitute on the completion of a year
long survey in conjunction with its
continuing study of the smog prob
lem, sponsored by the Western Oil
and Gas Association.
Almost two-thirds of the chemicals
i entering the air are organic in na
; turt'. The biggest single source,

household burning of 4,000 tons of
trash daily, alone sends 550 tons of
these organic materials into the air
every 24 hours.
Exhaust fumes from the approxi
mately 2.000,0<)0 automobiles, buses
1 and trucks operated daily in Los An
; geles County, driving an average of
50,000,000 miles a day, contribute an-
I other 350 tons of organic substances,
J as well as 30 tons of eye-irritating
J aldehydes and 40 tons of nitrogen
I oxides.
Approximately at) equal amount of
i gasoline vapor 400 tons—escapes by
evaporation, 250 tons of which ate
lost from refinery operation:, and 150
i from automobile gas tanks and serv
ice stations.
"Beyond a doubt." said Dr. Paul 1..
Magill, technical supervisor of the ait
i pollution research program, "the sur
vey shows that smog is a community
problem. The sources of air pollution
arc many and varied. Any real im
provement in atmospheric condition■.
can be brought about only if all
sources are abated—the small and
the large."
