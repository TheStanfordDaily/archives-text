# 'Battle of The Cellar' Is Theme of Big Game
## Stagier, Tucker Scoring Duel To Highlight Double Feature 
### EARL ODELL 
Stanford's rejuvenated cage team will attempt to save face this
weekend and crawl out of the PCC cellar when it meets its base
ment mate, California, in the Cow Palace Friday night and at
Berkeley Saturday night. Starting time for both games is 8:30.
The Indian freshman team will play 6:30 preliminary games both

nights against the Cal frosh.
The closing contests for the sea- I
son find both the Indians and the
Bears reposing in the bottom half of
the league, each with three wins and
seven losses. UCLA and USC, who
meet in Los Angeles at approxi
mately the same time, are tied for
honors with seven wins
and three Josses.
Besides the team contest, an add
ed attraction will be a scoring duel
between the Cards' high-flying for
ward, Eddie Tucker, and Cal's man
of-the-yeai', Billy Hagler, a 6-foot
4-inch center who may be switched
to forward this weekend to let bean
pole Clay Grey start at the pivot
post. Dick Ridgeway of UCLA pres
ently leads the point race with 186 |
points, followed by Tucker with 171
and Hagler with 159. Of the two,
Eddie and Billy, only Eddie has a
possibility to overtake Ridgeway,
but the chances are that the winner
of the duel will have to settle for
second place.
If Hagler starts at center for the
Bears, that means that John Rick
sen and Larry Horan will open at
forwards. Ricksen has been an
important cog in Coach tfibs
Price's cage machine all season,
while Horan is a hard driver and
jump shot man.
At the guard posts will be Bob
See and Rupe Ricksen, John's twin
brother and the answer to having
numbers on every man's shirt. Rupe
and John look so much alike that
their opponents often don't know
who's playing what position,
j Overlooked because of the star
ring of Hagler, See is nevertheless a
standout guard on the Coast and
will give the Indians more than a
1 little trouble with his long set shots.
Coach Everett Dean has been
: experimenting with his charges
the past two weeks and has come
up with some good combinations.
Bill Stevenson, who played little
until last weekend, started against
the Trojans and combined with
center Jim Ramstead for some
excellent backboard work. An
other backboard man who has
: shown great promise is 6-foot 4-
inch Gary Andrews. Gary will
see more than his share of action
against the Bears.
However, Dean will possibly go
j back to his original five for the final
] games. Besides Ramstead at center,
Tucker will open at one forward
! with Jack O'Sullivan as his mate.

At the guard spots Jim Walsh and
Bruce Iversen will probably start.
Bruce, who sat last weekend's
games on the bench, proved to the
Card mentor that he couldn't be
overlooked by scoring 23 points for
the Braves against the Indian frosh.
He looked particularly outstanding
with his long-distance set shots.
Jumping Jack O'Sullivan will •
be plavine; his last two games for
the Cards this weekend agairvt
Cal. Jack is the captain of the
squad and is a natural floor lead
er. Seldom flustered. Sully has
made a name for himself by over
coming his lack of height (5 ft.
8 in.) with spectacular jump shots.
Last Friday against CSC
Jack was unstoppable as he drove
in from every spot on the floor,
scoring a total of 24 points.
Jim Ramstead, Indians' lanky six
foot five-inch center, can bo counted
on for a lot of backboard control.
The "Rammer" is deadly on a fade
away jump shot and is a constant
threat to his opponents with his tip
ins.
Stanford will be at a disadvan
tage in the final games, playfnff
away from home, but with a large
turnout in the Indian rooting sec
tion the Cards can overcome it.
Cal and Stanford are evenly
matched and it looks like the cage
"Big Game" is a tossup.
Students planning to attend the
games are urged to arrive early to
get tickets and seats.
