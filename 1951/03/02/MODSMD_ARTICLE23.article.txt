Preparing for Communism
Asked if Communism was a sig
nificant force among American col
lege students, Mrs. Luce said that
American students did not expressly
advocate Communism but were being
j prepared for it by forces at work in
1 this country today.
Materialism and a false emphasis
on equality will eventually cause a
"fragmentation of society, resulting
in utter chaos," she stated. After
-such chaos, explained Mrs. Luce, the
people will want order, and such a
condition is a "fertile field for dic
tatorship."
Chapel Donated

cism, Mrs. Luce has written many
articles and several books. One of
her more recent projects is the ad
dition to the Stanford Newman Club
of St. Ann's Chapel, named in mem
ory of her daughter who was killed
while a student here.
According to Mrs. Luce, "We are
engaged in a real military and polit
ical conflict with Soviet Russia, but

we are also engaged in a great ideo
logical conflict. The fundamental
question is concernod with the na
ture of man."
"Only One Choice"
"We have only one choice," she
maintained. "Either we consider
man a mixture of physical and spiri
tual natures, or we consider man
solely animal."
Mrs. Luce urged her audience to
confirm their faith in the spirituality
of man sincc this faith is the only
force capable of saving "our Chris
tian civilization."
"Our affirmation of (this) faith is
the last citadel of reason in this
crumbling world," she concluded.
