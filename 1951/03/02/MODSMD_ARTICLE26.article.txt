# It's Costing YOU Money

In grammar school it was "Keep the school
yard clean!"; in high school it was "Keep the
campus clean!"; now in college it's "Keep the
Cellar clean!" — the same exhortations, the
same people, and, unfortunately, the same poor
results.
By now, the lectured know the lines as well
as the lecturer, so why prattle on about the
whys and wherefores of cleaning-up? The
above picture speaks for itself. The innumer
able paper cups, bags, and napkins are all there
—certainly not making for the most pleasant
and sanitary atmosphere in which to eat, drink,
and be merry.
But there's another angle to this clean-up
problem, possibly of no greater importance
than the sanitary and cleanly considerations,
but one that has been less publicized. The an
gle is a financial one.
The ASSU pays 75 cents or more an hour,
eight hours a day, to two porters, two students
for at least an hour a day, and janitors for spot

clean-ups as well as regular service at night j
and early in the morning. Some of this expense
is for routine cleaning, naturally, but a large j
part of it provides for the perennial picking-up
of papers carelessly abandoned by students.
It just two hours could be cut from the clean
ing time each day, ASSU would benetit $10 a
week and more than $100 a quarter. Those who
concern themselves with the expenses of send
ing an ASSU delegate to certain conferences
would do well to note this fact.
College students should not have to be re
minded to clean up after themselves, but if the
Cellar situation doesn't improve, we suggest j
the posting of proper posters and even, as one
Excom member recommended, the painting of
the garbage cans to make them conspicuous.
We believe the Cellar would cease to take
offense to students' traditional griping about
the guality of the coffee if only they did the
griping while on the way to deposit their
empty cups in the garbage can. —8.8.
