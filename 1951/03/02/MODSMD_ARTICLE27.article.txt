# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Belter Way to Spend Our Money 
### 
To Ihe editor:
It would lie indeed fortunate if the A.S.S.U. had
money enough besides that needed for campus ex
penditures to finance an unlimited number of projects
fbr world peace and international understanding.
The issue regarding the Rome delegate is not: do we
or don't we want to promote international understand
ing. Rather, it should be: is this the most effective
means of using our limited resources in the interest
of international understanding. I submit that it is not.
A delegate without the sincere backing of the group
ho represents is either an inactive appendage to any
convention or is, should he misrepresent his views as
that of the group he "represents," an active but un
desirable member of the convention. Neither case is
satisfactory or worthy of monetary support from.the
group. I suspect that the delegate in question would
not have unified backing here, but a student refer
endum is needed to prove or disprove this supposition.
Furthermore, should the delegate be approved, I feel
that there are better ways to spend our money in the
interests of international understanding. Care pack
ages for people in critical areas and books or mimeo
graph equipment for universities disabled by war are
more tangible and effective ways to express our de
sire for world peace. The $100 and additional solicited
funds would pay a considerable amount of postage for
clothes collected by a student clothes drive. Efforts
ifi these directions exist here and might well be ex
jfcmded.
. Reports on the factual proceedings of the conven
tion can no doubt be obtained. A declaration of good
will could be extended by a letter from the A.S.S.U.
Any advantages other than this to be obtained by
sending a delegate to the Rome Convention should bo
weighed very carefully against more effective ways to
sfaend our money in the interest of international un
(frrstanding.
I.and I am sure many others, would have more
inspect for our student government if, in the light of
considerations such as the above, they v/ould rise
;.Jiove any pressure groups and reverse their decision
t<) send a delegate or, at least, call for a student ref
< j endum.
