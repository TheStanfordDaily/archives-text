# Frosh Social Fiasco

To the Editor:
Where are our freshman dues going? Each fresh
man has paid (or will pay, as soon as it is collected
from him) $4 in freshman dues. This $4. he is told,
v/ill go in part toward a formal dance for each living
group.
rhero are over 500 freshmen living in Encina. Some
portion of the $2000 in flues goes toward the Encina
winter formal. So what happens? First a dance date
is tentatively announced in The Daily last January
for February 2'5. Then the committee changer; this date

to March 10; then it changes it again to March 9, due
to conflicting social activities. Then changes the date
again—back to March 10th, due to a Sadie Hawkins
all-campus dancc.
Now that the bewildered freshman has made a date
to the formal (if there still remain any girls not al
ready dated, due to the infamous "ratio")—FOß THE
SECOND, THIRD, or FOURTH TIME, he relaxes and
makes his plans for attending this winter formal.
"It should be terriffic," he thinks. "Think of all the
money they can spend on the dance." (Probably over
$800). And well should he expect a terrific dance. So
now what happens?
The "dance committee" has waited until a scant
three weeks before the announced date to attempt to
secure a suitable location in which to hold this "spec
tacular winter formal." But of course all the desir
able locations for a large formal have been already
reserved by this time—so the dance is going to be held
in the Encina lounge. Does this represent efficient
planning by the "dance committee?" Does this repre
sent any planning at all? No, it certainly does not!
It is no wonder then, that at the fireside held at En
cina last Saturday night, (which was announced only
Monday before), only thirteen couplos were present.
This is 2.4 per cent of those living at Encina. A pretty
sad state of affairs when only 2 per cent of a living
group will turn out to support their own activities!
Why should Encina men plan on attending an event
which, if they knew about it in time, they are not even
sure will be on the announced date.
Come on. you who consider yourselves to bo a
"dance committee," let's get on the ball.

planning by the "dance committee?" Does this repre
sent any planning at all? No, it certainly does not!
It is no wonder then, that at the fireside held at En
cina last Saturday night, (which was announced only
Monday before), only thirteen couplos were present.
This is 2.4 per cent of those living at Encina. A pretty
sad state of affairs when only 2 per cent of a living
group will turn out to support their own activities!
Why should Encina men plan on attending an event
which, if they knew about it in time, they are not even
sure will be on the announced date.
Come on. you who consider yourselves to bo a
"dance committee," let's get on the ball.

To the Editor:
Where are our freshman dues going? Each fresh
man has paid (or will pay, as soon as it is collected
from him) $4 in freshman dues. This $4. he is told,
v/ill go in part toward a formal dance for each living
group.
rhero are over 500 freshmen living in Encina. Some
portion of the $2000 in flues goes toward the Encina
winter formal. So what happens? First a dance date
is tentatively announced in The Daily last January
for February 2'5. Then the committee changer; this date

to March 10; then it changes it again to March 9, due
to conflicting social activities. Then changes the date
again—back to March 10th, due to a Sadie Hawkins
all-campus dancc.
Now that the bewildered freshman has made a date
to the formal (if there still remain any girls not al
ready dated, due to the infamous "ratio")—FOß THE
SECOND, THIRD, or FOURTH TIME, he relaxes and
makes his plans for attending this winter formal.
"It should be terriffic," he thinks. "Think of all the
money they can spend on the dance." (Probably over
$800). And well should he expect a terrific dance. So
now what happens?
The "dance committee" has waited until a scant
three weeks before the announced date to attempt to
secure a suitable location in which to hold this "spec
tacular winter formal." But of course all the desir
able locations for a large formal have been already
reserved by this time—so the dance is going to be held
in the Encina lounge. Does this represent efficient
planning by the "dance committee?" Does this repre
sent any planning at all? No, it certainly does not!
It is no wonder then, that at the fireside held at En
cina last Saturday night, (which was announced only
Monday before), only thirteen couplos were present.
