# India Students Thank IIR

### 
To the Editor:
The students from India wish to welcome the latest
effort by the IIR toward extending student relations
and relief to a university in India.
The considerable monetary and material support
will go a long way toward helping the student of the
university, but what seems to us to be equn'lv im
portant is the contact between the students of the two
countries which will result from thi.-, gesture. We are
sure that the University of Delhi will justify its choice
by providing an interesting exchange of ideas and
indigenous information.
Those of us who are already a part of Stanford ad
mire the efforts of the lIR and the interest being shown
by the faculty and the students. We take this oppor
tunity to extend our fullest co-operation in nil thee
and similar activities on the Farm.
The lIR has been eloquent in stressing more student
interest in International Relations- we wish to be
equally eloquent in applauding their sincere effort .
