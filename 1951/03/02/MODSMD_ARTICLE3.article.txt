# Big 4 to Meet Monday
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The United
States, Britain, and France agreed
today to meet with Russia in Paris
Monday in an effort to arrange a
full-scale Big Four foreign minis
ters' confcrcncc on East-West prob
lems.
State Department officials were
openly pessimistic, however, about
reaching any real basis for fruitful
talks with the Soviets.
Uncertainty on Russian readiness
to discuss general East-West ten
sions appeared to be the main stum
bling-block in the way of the dep
uties, who are to arrange the agenda
for the later meeting.
