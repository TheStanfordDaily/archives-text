GYMS LOCKED SUNDAYS
The shutdown of Stanford's ath
letic plants on Sundays is an unnec
essary and unfortunate conditioi
that should be remedied. Out of re
spect to Mrs. Stanford's personal de
sire that there be no athletics or
Sundays, the Men's Gym (built it
1915) and the Women's Gym (buil
jn 1931) have been locked on Sun
days, the day that the most peopl<
have the most time to use the fa
cilities.
The apparent reason for Mrs
Stanford's request was her cherishec
belief that Sunday should be devotee
to religious activity, and that then
be no athletic doings. No one ear
dispute her wishes. But today the
plan is inconsistent.
INCONSISTENCY OF CLOSING
Basically the gyms are closed or
Sundays, also the swimming pools
Yet in spring quarter the pools art
often open on Sunday afternoon
Tennis courts are open the yeai
round. The golf course is open or
Sundays. And what's more, basket
ball and volleyball courts are in ful
swing every Sunday at various liv
ing groups.
Mrs. Stanford had only the finest
of intentions. But today, most re
ligious denominations end their
church services at noon, and expeel
their congregations to spend the re
mainder of the day in a manner most
suited to the individual's desires
Furthermore many students have nc
strong feeling against athletic ac
tivity on Sunday, and in fact want it.
If the athletic plants were opened
at noon on Sundays, the decision to
participate in athletic activity would
lie with the individual. It seems only
fair that the facilities be made avail
able for the majority who would use
them.
If there is talk that the plants are
closed because of tradition, let us not
forget that popular desire has bro
ken many of Mrs. Stanford's original
wishes which subsequently became
traditions.
COST WOULD BE SMALL
Perhaps the University's refusal to
open the facilities is due to finan
cial reasons. But the cost of oper
ating the facilities for five added
hours a week (noon to 5 p.m.) would
be small.
The reasons and benefits for open
ing the gyms on Sundays are obvi
ous, but the most important fact is
that the students and faculty want
athletic facilities provided on Sun
days.
Let's open the athletic facilities on

Yet in spring quarter the pools art
often open on Sunday afternoon
Tennis courts are open the yeai
round. The golf course is open or
Sundays. And what's more, basket
ball and volleyball courts are in ful
swing every Sunday at various liv
ing groups.
Mrs. Stanford had only the finest
of intentions. But today, most re
ligious denominations end their
church services at noon, and expeel
their congregations to spend the re
mainder of the day in a manner most
suited to the individual's desires
Furthermore many students have nc
strong feeling against athletic ac
tivity on Sunday, and in fact want it.
If the athletic plants were opened
at noon on Sundays, the decision to
participate in athletic activity would
lie with the individual. It seems only
fair that the facilities be made avail
able for the majority who would use
them.
If there is talk that the plants are
closed because of tradition, let us not
forget that popular desire has bro
ken many of Mrs. Stanford's original
wishes which subsequently became
traditions.
COST WOULD BE SMALL
Perhaps the University's refusal to
open the facilities is due to finan
cial reasons. But the cost of oper
ating the facilities for five added
hours a week (noon to 5 p.m.) would
be small.
The reasons and benefits for open
ing the gyms on Sundays are obvi
ous, but the most important fact is
that the students and faculty want
athletic facilities provided on Sun
days.
Let's open the athletic facilities on
Sundays.
GYMS LOCKED SUNDAYS
The shutdown of Stanford's ath
letic plants on Sundays is an unnec
essary and unfortunate conditioi
that should be remedied. Out of re
spect to Mrs. Stanford's personal de
sire that there be no athletics or
Sundays, the Men's Gym (built it
1915) and the Women's Gym (buil
jn 1931) have been locked on Sun
days, the day that the most peopl<
have the most time to use the fa
cilities.
The apparent reason for Mrs
Stanford's request was her cherishec
belief that Sunday should be devotee
to religious activity, and that then
be no athletic doings. No one ear
dispute her wishes. But today the
plan is inconsistent.
INCONSISTENCY OF CLOSING
Basically the gyms are closed or
Sundays, also the swimming pools
