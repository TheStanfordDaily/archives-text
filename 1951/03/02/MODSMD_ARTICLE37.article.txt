Stanford's swimming team will
host the national JC champions,
Fullerton JC. tomorrow afternoon at
3 in the Encina Pools.
It will be the last home meet be
fore the Indians compete in the
NCAA meet March 29 through 31.
Once again the spotlight will lae on
the relay teams, to see whether they
have the stuff to place in the NCAA
meet.
Hornets Not Too Tough
Stanford probably won't have too
much trouble wilh Fullerton, al
though the Hornets recently beat
UCLA. Fullerton's best swimmer is
Hoy Brown, who won the 100
against the Cards last year in 52.9.
Pete Cole and Ashley Jones will
be swimming with an eye to the Na
tionals. Pete, who was third in the
NCAA 1,500 meters last year, will be
out to chalk up a good time in the
440. in the face of many topnotch
performances all over the country
already.
Cole Betters NCAA Time
In the quarter, Pete has done 4:42
this year in practice, which is better
than the winning time in the NCAA
last year. The joker in this deck is
that five swimmers, three of them
Yale sophomores, have also done
much better.
Jones, who went to Glendale JC
last year, has done 2:25 in the 200-
yard breaststroke. Haynie opines
that he has enough races under his
belt, and is now capable of close to
2:20. which would prboably get him
a place in the Nationals.
Old Home Week
It will be "old home week" for

throe of the Indians' top swimmers;
Ernie Polte. Bob Frojen, and Bobby
Thompson all went to Fullerton be
fore coming to Stanford.
