# RAIN, RAIN, STAY AWAY
## Dons, Bercovich Club Test Indian Baseball Strength 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
At last report, Assistant Baseball
Coach Dutch Fehring was seen gaz
ing out the window at murky skies
and heard muttering phrases from
the old nursery rhyme "Rain, rain,
go to Spain." Providing his wishes
are answered, Stanford's varsity
nine will meet the USF Dons at 3:15
p.m. today and the Bercovich semi
pro club at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow.
Both games are on tap here, and
unless the farmers get to Jupe Plu
vius first, Stanford will have its first
opportunity to get over the .500 per
cent mark. At present they have
captured two decisions and dropped
the same number.
USF has played but one game, that
a 5 to 2 win over the Boston Brave
Rookies. In this game the Hilltop
pers' hurlers gave up but five scat
tered hits, while their teammates
were raking Brave ace Red Walsh
for nine, three of them by Gene Ja
cobs.
Much of the Dons' pitching suc
cess in the last two years can be at
tributed to the fine receiving ability
oi catcher Tim Riordan, hero of the
Dons' 4 to 2 victory over USC last
season. In addition, the USF lineup
is loaded with veterans, as evi
denced by the fact that their star

shortstop of last year, "Dynamite"
Dunn, is currently riding the bench.
The Bercovich club, winners of
the San Francisco semi-pro win
ter league, is supposedly loaded
with star professioals, who are
anxious to get in their last licks
before heading south for spring
training.
Last year the Bercovichs easily si
lenced the CIBA pennant winners,
and had such name stars in their
lineup as Jimmy Moran, Jackie Al
bright, Lil Arnerich, Bob Ballard,
and other professional journeymen.
Opposing the Oakland opponents
will be pitchers Kog Osenbaugh,
Bob Murphy, and Tony Stellar.
Joe Chez and Jim Claypool will be
throwing the strikes against the
Dons.
It is expected that Dave Rosen
krantz. hero of the 1 to 0 win over
San Jose State, may break into the
starting outfield lineup this week
along with lefty Jim Agar. Rosen
krantz, a very determined gentle
man both at the plate and in the out
field, has been doing a good job of
impressing Coach Fehring that he
wants to play every day. At present
Agar has been kept out of the line
up because of the predominance of
left-handed pitchers the opposition
has thrown at the varsity, but he has
looked extremely good the few times
he's been at bat.

At last report, Assistant Baseball
Coach Dutch Fehring was seen gaz
ing out the window at murky skies
and heard muttering phrases from
the old nursery rhyme "Rain, rain,
go to Spain." Providing his wishes
are answered, Stanford's varsity
nine will meet the USF Dons at 3:15
p.m. today and the Bercovich semi
pro club at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow.
Both games are on tap here, and
unless the farmers get to Jupe Plu
vius first, Stanford will have its first
opportunity to get over the .500 per
cent mark. At present they have
captured two decisions and dropped
the same number.
USF has played but one game, that
a 5 to 2 win over the Boston Brave
Rookies. In this game the Hilltop
pers' hurlers gave up but five scat
tered hits, while their teammates
were raking Brave ace Red Walsh
for nine, three of them by Gene Ja
cobs.
Much of the Dons' pitching suc
cess in the last two years can be at
tributed to the fine receiving ability
oi catcher Tim Riordan, hero of the
Dons' 4 to 2 victory over USC last
season. In addition, the USF lineup
is loaded with veterans, as evi
denced by the fact that their star

shortstop of last year, "Dynamite"
Dunn, is currently riding the bench.
The Bercovich club, winners of
the San Francisco semi-pro win
ter league, is supposedly loaded
with star professioals, who are
anxious to get in their last licks
before heading south for spring
training.
Last year the Bercovichs easily si
lenced the CIBA pennant winners,
and had such name stars in their
lineup as Jimmy Moran, Jackie Al
bright, Lil Arnerich, Bob Ballard,
and other professional journeymen.
Opposing the Oakland opponents
will be pitchers Kog Osenbaugh,
Bob Murphy, and Tony Stellar.
Joe Chez and Jim Claypool will be
throwing the strikes against the
Dons.
It is expected that Dave Rosen
krantz. hero of the 1 to 0 win over
San Jose State, may break into the
starting outfield lineup this week
along with lefty Jim Agar. Rosen
krantz, a very determined gentle
man both at the plate and in the out
field, has been doing a good job of
impressing Coach Fehring that he
wants to play every day. At present
Agar has been kept out of the line
up because of the predominance of
left-handed pitchers the opposition
has thrown at the varsity, but he has
looked extremely good the few times
he's been at bat.
