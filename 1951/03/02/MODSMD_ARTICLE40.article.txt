# 'Best-Ever' Frosh to Battle Cubs
## Papooses End Season In Palace, Berkeley 
### PETE GROTHE 
Generalissimo Bob Burnett and his contingent of "best ever"
frosh basketballers troop into the Cow Palace tonight and then re
intrench in Berkeley Saturday night to battle with the Cal frosh.
Tip-off time for both games will be 6:30.
The games, which will be preliminaries for the varsity tilts, will
ring down the curtain on one of the . « i

most productive frosh seasons in
Stanford history. Burnett, at the be
ginning of the season, described the
team as "the best since I came here j
in 1937."
The Cardbabes have ventured out i
of the barn 17 times, and 16 times
they have come back with the oppo- !
sition's scalp, the lone mishap being I
a one basket loss to the USF frosh. j
Cal, however, despite Stanford's
amazing record, is expected to
show up for the hall games.
The Bear Cubs, although lacking j
the press clippings of their adver- !
saries, have a sound team and would i
like nothing better tlhan to upset
Stanford's fast breaking yearlings. J
The Cubs play a free lance type ol j
offense, shifting from a post game to !
fast break to other styles of play.
The last times the two teams met, j
Stanford prevailed, 65 to 55. and 64
to 55.
California will field a team con
sisting of Dick Tamberg and Bob
Kardell at forwards, Jerry Ander
son at center, and Gene Davis and
Harry Mock at guards.
The yearlings this past week have
been working on a man-to-man de
fense, with the result a considerable
improvement in the defense depart
ment.
The starting lineup remains co
captain Don DeLong and Ilal Ellis
at forwards, Dave Epperson at cen
ter, and co-captain Olie Su/.dalelV
and Don Carlson at guards. Ep
person has an average of 13.5 j
points in 15 games, antl Carlson is
a step behind with 10.7 digits in 15
games.
The six-foot, six-inch Epperson is I
a demon on the boards, and has one
of the classiest hook shots in the
business. Carlson is a beautifully co
ordinated athlete, and is amazing on
the boards.
One of the strong points of this j
year's squad is its superior reserve
strength. Forward Sam Morley, stel
lar offensive player, guard Tom !
Green, a smooth and hustling per
former, Jack Gebert, Dennis Dick- i
son, and Ray Swartz are but a few
of Burnett's many capable reserves. I


IT'S FIVE BASKETS—Although the irosh basketball team will be restricted to one casaba when
it meets the California Bear Cubs, the five Papoose starters are getting a little practice. Left to
right, they are Olie Suzdaleff, Hal Ellis, Dave Epperson, Don Carlson, and Don DeLong. These
boys have won 16 out of 1? games. —Daily photo by Tom Peterson
