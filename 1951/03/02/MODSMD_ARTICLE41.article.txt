# Pole Vaulters, Javelin Throwers Weak; Harlow, Johnson Lead Young Hopefuls

### KEITH MULROONEY 
(Editor's note: This is the third
in a series of articles discussing the
prospects of Stanford's track team
in the coming season. Today's
events: javelin and pole vault.)

Two of the biggest tasks that Track
Coach Weiershauser will face this
season are finding a replacement for
a three-time NCAA javelin cham
pion and manufacturing a winning
pole vaulter. At present, his chances
of succeeding in either job seem
rather slim.
Looking over his material, the
coach concludes that Stanford will
send a good, but young crop of pole
vaulters and javelin throwers into
the 1951 track and field wars. In
both events, the Indians will be fac
ing most of the top competitors of
the nation right here on the Pacific

Coast, so they will probably not fare
too well.
lop hope among javelin contend
ers is Chuck Harlow, who did 181 ft.
as a freshman last year. Weiershau
| ser says Chuck will hit 200 ft. this
| year.
Behind Harlow are three juniors.
; Bob Green, Ed Triplett, and Dick
Henigan, all tossing between 175 ft.
and 180 ft.
These boys must face UCLA's Cy
Young, 229 it., Santa Barbara's Delf
Pickerts, 228 ft., and Cal's George
Roseme, 221 ft., all of whom placed
in last year's NCAA finals.
To make the Card hopefuls' task
! seem more difficult, they must step
into the shoes of Bud Held, who won
the NCAA title for Stanford the last
three years.
The ranks of the pole vaulters are
even thinner than those of the spear

tossers. Weiershauser has two 13-ft.
jumpers to work with in this event.
The top vaulter is sophomore Duke
Johnson, who Weiershauser hopes
will do at least 13 ft. G in. The sec
ond is George Van Heusen, who
cleared 13 ft. for the Cards in 1948.
These two must face the likes of
SC's trio of Walt Jensen, 14 ft. 4 in.;
Jack Rowan, 14 It.; and Bob Johnson,
13 ft. 6 in.
The top collegiate vaulter this year
will probably be Don Laz of Illinois,
who has already cleared 14 ft. BV2
in. in indoor meets.
Weiershauser added that both
events could be greatly strengthened
by entering Bob Mathitis, who has
vaulted 13 ft. and tossed the javelin
183. But he said that under present
plans, Mathias will concentrate on
the discus, shot put, and high hur
dles.

will do at least 13 ft. G in. The sec
ond is George Van Heusen, who
cleared 13 ft. for the Cards in 1948.
These two must face the likes of
SC's trio of Walt Jensen, 14 ft. 4 in.;
Jack Rowan, 14 It.; and Bob Johnson,
13 ft. 6 in.
The top collegiate vaulter this year
will probably be Don Laz of Illinois,
who has already cleared 14 ft. BV2
in. in indoor meets.
Weiershauser added that both
events could be greatly strengthened
by entering Bob Mathitis, who has
vaulted 13 ft. and tossed the javelin
183. But he said that under present
plans, Mathias will concentrate on
the discus, shot put, and high hur
dles.
(Editor's note: This is the third
in a series of articles discussing the
prospects of Stanford's track team
in the coming season. Today's
events: javelin and pole vault.)

Two of the biggest tasks that Track
Coach Weiershauser will face this
season are finding a replacement for
a three-time NCAA javelin cham
pion and manufacturing a winning
pole vaulter. At present, his chances
of succeeding in either job seem
rather slim.
Looking over his material, the
coach concludes that Stanford will
send a good, but young crop of pole
vaulters and javelin throwers into
the 1951 track and field wars. In
both events, the Indians will be fac
ing most of the top competitors of
the nation right here on the Pacific

Coast, so they will probably not fare
too well.
lop hope among javelin contend
ers is Chuck Harlow, who did 181 ft.
as a freshman last year. Weiershau
| ser says Chuck will hit 200 ft. this
| year.
Behind Harlow are three juniors.
; Bob Green, Ed Triplett, and Dick
Henigan, all tossing between 175 ft.
and 180 ft.
These boys must face UCLA's Cy
Young, 229 it., Santa Barbara's Delf
Pickerts, 228 ft., and Cal's George
Roseme, 221 ft., all of whom placed
in last year's NCAA finals.
To make the Card hopefuls' task
! seem more difficult, they must step
into the shoes of Bud Held, who won
the NCAA title for Stanford the last
three years.
The ranks of the pole vaulters are
even thinner than those of the spear

tossers. Weiershauser has two 13-ft.
jumpers to work with in this event.
The top vaulter is sophomore Duke
Johnson, who Weiershauser hopes
will do at least 13 ft. G in. The sec
ond is George Van Heusen, who
cleared 13 ft. for the Cards in 1948.
