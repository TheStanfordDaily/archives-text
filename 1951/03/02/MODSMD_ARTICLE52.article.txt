# Cave Explorers Visit Famous Gold Region
## 
### 
Last weekend the Stanford Speleological Society visited caves
in the gold region of California—Calaveras County, the region
made famous by Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and their contemporaries
during the Gold Rush.
The "cavers" explored and took data in the lowest levels known

today of Moaning Cave, a commer
cial cavern in Calaveras County.
Excavations in the main room are
now under way to open up massive
chambers at depths down to 450 feet
which were reported by State Geol
ogist John B. Brask in 1851. These
lower levels were at that time re
ported to contain large numbers of
human skeletons, but later mining
operations scaled up the key pas
sage.
Graveyard 200 Feet Down
Recent discoveries by the Califor
nia Archeological Survey have re
vealed a mass graveyard 200 feet
underground. Vast quantities of
human skeletons, obsidian arrow
points, stone pestles, abalone shell
ornaments, various kinds of beads,
and a few animal bones were found.
The cultural material unearthed ap
peared to be predominantly from the
period between 1500 B.C. and 500
A.D.
One theory as to how hundreds of
corpses came to be at the bottom
of the cave's 200-foot vertical shaft
is that the bodies were thrown into
the chamber from a ledge in the
upper part of the cave.
This theory, however, does not
coincide with known facts about the
Indian tribes that once inhabited the
region. The Sierra Miwok tribe, for
instance, cither cremated or buried
its dead.
Saw Limestone Bridges
The group also visited the little
known Natural Bridges of Cala
veras County. These two bridges are
among the finest examples of lime
stone solution and deposition seen in
California. The bridges, spaced
about half a mile apart, occur on
Coyote Creek, three miles south of
Vallccito.
Each bridge is about 300 feet in

length and is traveled by a sizeable
stream of water. Throughout the
course of each tunnel are found "cu
rious and beauiful formations" —
stalactites and stalagmites, a "rock
cascade," and columns.
Boated Through
The explorers did not have facili
ties available for accurate measure
ments, but they were able to make
out the ceiling of the main room in
the upper bridge by the light of car
bide lamps as they paddled through
in the boat.
The walls of the tunnels are en
tirely coated with flowstone, spouts
of water issue from the walls, and
waterfalls veil the passage at both
entrances.
Stanford Grotto members who
took part in the explorations were
George Mowat, Ralph Beymer, Jack
Jacobus, and Art Lange.

Coyote Creek, three miles south of
Vallccito.
Each bridge is about 300 feet in

length and is traveled by a sizeable
stream of water. Throughout the
course of each tunnel are found "cu
rious and beauiful formations" —
stalactites and stalagmites, a "rock
cascade," and columns.
Boated Through
The explorers did not have facili
ties available for accurate measure
ments, but they were able to make
out the ceiling of the main room in
the upper bridge by the light of car
bide lamps as they paddled through
in the boat.
The walls of the tunnels are en
tirely coated with flowstone, spouts
of water issue from the walls, and
waterfalls veil the passage at both
entrances.
Stanford Grotto members who
took part in the explorations were
George Mowat, Ralph Beymer, Jack
Jacobus, and Art Lange.
Last weekend the Stanford Speleological Society visited caves
in the gold region of California—Calaveras County, the region
made famous by Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and their contemporaries
during the Gold Rush.
The "cavers" explored and took data in the lowest levels known

today of Moaning Cave, a commer
cial cavern in Calaveras County.
Excavations in the main room are
now under way to open up massive
chambers at depths down to 450 feet
which were reported by State Geol
ogist John B. Brask in 1851. These
lower levels were at that time re
ported to contain large numbers of
human skeletons, but later mining
operations scaled up the key pas
sage.
Graveyard 200 Feet Down
Recent discoveries by the Califor
nia Archeological Survey have re
vealed a mass graveyard 200 feet
underground. Vast quantities of
human skeletons, obsidian arrow
points, stone pestles, abalone shell
ornaments, various kinds of beads,
and a few animal bones were found.
The cultural material unearthed ap
peared to be predominantly from the
period between 1500 B.C. and 500
A.D.
One theory as to how hundreds of
corpses came to be at the bottom
of the cave's 200-foot vertical shaft
is that the bodies were thrown into
the chamber from a ledge in the
upper part of the cave.
This theory, however, does not
coincide with known facts about the
Indian tribes that once inhabited the
region. The Sierra Miwok tribe, for
instance, cither cremated or buried
its dead.
Saw Limestone Bridges
The group also visited the little
known Natural Bridges of Cala
veras County. These two bridges are
among the finest examples of lime
stone solution and deposition seen in
California. The bridges, spaced
about half a mile apart, occur on
Coyote Creek, three miles south of
Vallccito.
Each bridge is about 300 feet in

length and is traveled by a sizeable
stream of water. Throughout the
course of each tunnel are found "cu
