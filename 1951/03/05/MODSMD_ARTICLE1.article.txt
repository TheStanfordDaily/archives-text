## Vote on Draft Is Tomorrow 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 1 (LP)—
The Senate votes tomorrow on
whether to draft youths at age 18
or IBV2 to help build the nation's
armed forces to 3,500,000 - man
strength.
Administration forces are confi
dent the vote will show a thumping
majority against an amendment by
Sen. Wayne Morse, R., Ore., to fix
the age limit at 18Va•
But even if Morse's amendment is
defeated, the 18-year-old draft bill
will still be a long way from becom
ing law. There arc at least a dozen
other amendments awaiting Senate
debate and action.
The 18-year-old draft is in even
more trouble in the House. The
House Armed Services Committee is
working on a bill to draft youths at
18Mi, and guarantee that they would
not go into combat before 19.
