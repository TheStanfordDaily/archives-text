# PLANE LOST
## No Sign of Missing Students Found Yet 
### 
The search for an airplane carry
ing two Stanford men and the fian
cee of one of the students, missing
between Fresno and Las Vegas, goes
into its third day today.
Albert Lindaucr, Delta Chi geol
ogy major; Ted Norbury, Sigma Nu
mining engineering grad, and Nor
bury's fiancee, Terry Breck, assist
ant. advertising manager of the Los
Gatos Times, were aboard the plane.
The three took off at 8:30 a.m.
Friday from Santa Clara Valley
Airport in a rented light Stinson Air
Station Wagon bound for Santa Fe.
N.M. The plant was last heard from
at 9:35 that morning when Norbury
radioed Chandler Field in Fresno '
that he planned to take the most
direct route to Las Vegas, where he
would refuel before continuing to
Santa Fc.
The Oakland Airway Traffic Con
trol Center, the agency collecting
reports on the search, said that I
clouds were topping the mountains
of the Sierra Nevada range at the
time the plane would have been I
crossing them.

Thus far, the combined civilian
and Army air search has had no
success. When the plane failed to
report in at, Las Vegas Friday,
planes from Hamilton Air Base,
March Field, Chandler Field, and
the Fresno Civil Air Patrol began
surveying the area between Fresno
and Las Vegas.
It was feared that storm drifting
snows of the High Sierra might cov
er all trace of wreckage until spring
thaws in April.
The Oakland Traffic Control Cen
ter reported that weather was not
satisfactory for continued search
flights yesterday afternoon. Weath
er permitting, the search will re
sume today.
The two Stanford men intended to
return in the plane yesterday while
Miss Breck was to remain in Santa
Fe to complete plans for the couple's
wedding in Santa Fe on March 31.
Norbury served six years as a
Navy pilot and three years as a pilot
with TWA. Lindaucr is a Marine
veteran.
