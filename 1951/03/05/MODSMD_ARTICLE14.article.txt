# Initiation Plan Vetoed; IFH Views Financing Of Foreign Students
## Aid Asked Of ASSU 
### 
A new plan for financing AS
SU foreign scholarship students
whereby the cost of board and
60 per cent of the students'
spending money would be dis
tributed equally among Stan
ford's 24 fraternities, has been
presented to Interfraternity
Council by the Foreign Scholar
ship Committee.
Many fraternities arc expected to
vote on the plan at tonight's house i
meetings.
Under the new plan, each fra
ternity would contribute $:$5 a
quarter, which would cover hoard
and (ift per cent of the spending
money of four scholars per year
who would live on the Row. ASSU
would contribute the remaining V.)
per cent of the spending money,
which totals approximately $2.» per
month.
At the rate of per month, each '
fraternity would be spending $210
every two years to support tho schol
ars on the Row. Under tho existing
setup, according to Foreign Scholar
ship Chairman Phil Nielsen, it costs
each fraternity "about $210" to
wholly support a scholar for one
quarter.
"Under the proposal, if each fra
ternity took a scholar one quarter out
of six, or once every two years," 1
Nielsen stated, "the costs would be
the same as they are now—the only
difference being that the $210 ex
pense would be distributed over a
two-year period instead of falling all
at once."
Nielsen said the committee plans to
house four scholars on the How both
this year and next, subject to frater
nity approval.
He said room expenses under the
new plan would be paid by the fra- ;
ternity actually housing the student. '
and that fraternities would continue
to select the students they wanted,
as under the present program.
The foreign scholarship program
is jointly supported by the ASSU,
which last year budgeted $(>,200 for
eight students; the University,
which donates one-half of all tui
tion costs; the living groups (in
cluding some Men's and Women's
dorms); and. in some cases, the
federal government.
Next year, the committee plans to
bring over seven students — two
women, who will probably live in
women's dorms; four men who will
live on the Row; and one man who \
will live in a men's dorm.
The foreign scholarship committee
has prepared a mimeographed sheet
outlining the new proposal and has
posted it in each fraternity.
