## Big Loss In Budget Hits SAB 
### ROWLAND REBELE Editor, The Daily 
Nine Stanford Athletic Board
members sweating over a hot
budget!
That was the picture Saturday
morning as board members met
for a preliminary discussion of
the 1951-52 athletic budget. The !
tentative tally sheet read $537,- 1
000 in expected revenues and
3569,000 in expected expendi
tures. At present, a deficit of ;
$32,000.
In partial answer to the weighty 1
problem, chairman of the board
Louis Vincenti said there was a
"good chance" of paring $11,000 from
the expense side of the ledger. To
balance the remainder (some $21,-
000), Director of Athletics A 1 Mas
ters indicated he would have to "cut
down all along the exepnse line" to
come out even by May 1, when the
budget must be submitted in final
form to the President's office.
No Action Taken
Although no official slicing was
done yesterday, the Board is ex
pected to take conclusive action at
its final budget meeting April 28 here. !
Masters stated he had been as opti- !
mistic as possible in counting up esti
mated revenue for next year. He
said approximately $450,000 is ex
pected in football gate receipts, a
drop of $35,000 below this year's!
total.
He told representatives the re
mainder of income would come from i
other athletic events, student ath
letic fees, and a "hoped for" $40,000 ;
from the University to subsidize the I
athlctic program.
Rising Prices Add $25,000
Masters also stated this year's esti
mated budget of $524,800 might be
out of balance by as much as $25,000
due to a general increase in mainte- |
nance costs, come double salaries for |
football coaches, and the cost of
sending athletes to NCAA competi- j
tions, all of which wore not budg
eted at the years' beginning.
He indicated expenses would prob
ably rise to even greater heights
next year, while fontball revenues
had been estimated $35,000 lower due
to an expected drop in attendance at
the games.
I lie Board announced it would add
$ 50 to the general admission cost of
•he Oregon State and Washington!
State games next year, but Masters
indicated that any revenue gained
here would be more than offset by
the expected fall in overall attend
ance, especially at non-conference
games.

Cal game had been predicted a sell- j

atid that the UCLA and Washington !
tilts might conceivably exceed esti- '
mated revenue totals.

Vincenti pointed out that "even if a I
frosh team were dropped next season,
it would mean a small drop in ex
penses. Board members considered
cutting training table expenses,
which were $19,000 this year, but
took no definite action.

ures to prove tlie relationship be
tween football revenues and condi
tion of the budget. When football
teams were good and attendance
hiph, surpluses have appeared, he
said, while "in bad years" the sur
pluses have fallen and, iti some cases,
caused expenses to outweigh reve- |

Nine Stanford Athletic Board
members sweating over a hot
budget!
That was the picture Saturday
morning as board members met
for a preliminary discussion of
the 1951-52 athletic budget. The !
tentative tally sheet read $537,- 1
000 in expected revenues and
3569,000 in expected expendi
tures. At present, a deficit of ;
$32,000.
In partial answer to the weighty 1
problem, chairman of the board
Louis Vincenti said there was a
"good chance" of paring $11,000 from
the expense side of the ledger. To
balance the remainder (some $21,-
000), Director of Athletics A 1 Mas
ters indicated he would have to "cut
down all along the exepnse line" to
come out even by May 1, when the
budget must be submitted in final
form to the President's office.
No Action Taken
Although no official slicing was
done yesterday, the Board is ex
pected to take conclusive action at
its final budget meeting April 28 here. !
Masters stated he had been as opti- !
mistic as possible in counting up esti
mated revenue for next year. He
said approximately $450,000 is ex
pected in football gate receipts, a
drop of $35,000 below this year's!
total.
He told representatives the re
mainder of income would come from i
other athletic events, student ath
