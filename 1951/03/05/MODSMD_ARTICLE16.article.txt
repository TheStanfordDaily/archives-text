# IFC Ruling Is Canceled
## 
### 
Interfraternity Board of Con
trol, supreme governing body
of Stanford's national fraterni
ties, vetoed a proposal last week
which would have allowed fra
ternities to conduct informal ini
tiation practices outside their
houses—if such practices were
approved by a committee of the
Interfraternity Council.
The action came almost two weeks
after IFC, made up of each house
president, passed on the proposal
which would have constituted a re
peal of Rule No. 3 of the Fraternity
Code.
Rule No. 3 states that "informal
initiation practices will be confined
to the house and grounds of the
fraternity concerned."
Reaffirm Rule
In its reaffirmation of the rule,
IF B added to it the following:
"In initiation practices the pledge
is to be presented with a positi-e
and constructive program designed
to benefit him and the chapter,
rather than a negative program
which tends to harm physically, or
degrade morally, either the pledge
or the chapter."
In a second addition to the r.'.lc
which will directly affect each o.tin
Farm's fraternities, the IFB stated
that in the future, each house mu«t
submit to the Men's Counseling Of
fice a "notification of initiation" cr.rd
at least one week prior to the start
of the informal initiation.
A committee composed of the
Counselor for Men, the president of
IFC, and two members of IFC will
then meet with the fraternity pres
ident and the pledge trainer to dis
cuss the initiation practices in
volved.
Failure to comply with this rule
will lead to disciplinary action by
the Interfraternity Board.
Agitation Started in Fall
Agitation to repeal Rule No. 3,
which has been on the books since
1938, began last quarter when three
Farm fraternities were fined for
failure to hold informal initiations
within their own property on cam
pus.
According to Dave Larimer, IFC
president and member of IFB, en
forcement of the present ruling
without repeal will require "a lot of
co-operation on the part of all con
cerned —or the whoie thing will
fail."
In retaining the rule, various
members of IFB felt the problem of
enforcement would be too great if
individual fraternities were re
quired to clear through IFC before
holding informal initiations outside
their grounds.
One member of the 12-man board
said "the general rule is to de-em
phasize all unconstructive hell
weeks," and that-Rule No. 3, having
been on the books for 13 years,
seems to be the best method.

The action came almost two weeks
after IFC, made up of each house
president, passed on the proposal
which would have constituted a re
peal of Rule No. 3 of the Fraternity
Code.
Rule No. 3 states that "informal
initiation practices will be confined
to the house and grounds of the
fraternity concerned."
Reaffirm Rule
In its reaffirmation of the rule,
IF B added to it the following:
"In initiation practices the pledge
is to be presented with a positi-e
and constructive program designed
to benefit him and the chapter,
rather than a negative program
which tends to harm physically, or
degrade morally, either the pledge
or the chapter."
In a second addition to the r.'.lc
which will directly affect each o.tin
Farm's fraternities, the IFB stated
that in the future, each house mu«t
submit to the Men's Counseling Of
fice a "notification of initiation" cr.rd
at least one week prior to the start
of the informal initiation.
A committee composed of the
Counselor for Men, the president of
IFC, and two members of IFC will
then meet with the fraternity pres
ident and the pledge trainer to dis
cuss the initiation practices in
volved.
Failure to comply with this rule
will lead to disciplinary action by
the Interfraternity Board.
Agitation Started in Fall
Agitation to repeal Rule No. 3,
which has been on the books since
1938, began last quarter when three
Farm fraternities were fined for
failure to hold informal initiations
within their own property on cam
pus.
According to Dave Larimer, IFC
president and member of IFB, en
forcement of the present ruling
without repeal will require "a lot of
co-operation on the part of all con
cerned —or the whoie thing will
fail."
In retaining the rule, various
members of IFB felt the problem of
enforcement would be too great if
individual fraternities were re
quired to clear through IFC before
holding informal initiations outside
their grounds.
One member of the 12-man board
said "the general rule is to de-em
phasize all unconstructive hell
weeks," and that-Rule No. 3, having
been on the books for 13 years,
seems to be the best method.
Interfraternity Board of Con
trol, supreme governing body
of Stanford's national fraterni
ties, vetoed a proposal last week
which would have allowed fra
ternities to conduct informal ini
tiation practices outside their
houses—if such practices were
approved by a committee of the
Interfraternity Council.
