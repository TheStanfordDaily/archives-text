# BULL SESSION
## Lake Lag a la Waikiki 
### EARL ODELL 
It may seem a bit early for this, but if we're to make
a success of it, we have to start right away.
Lounging around in my red and white long handles
(if that ain't respect for me almo tomato, what is?)
and my mink-trimmed ear muffs the other day, I came

upon the greatest idea since Adam
glimpsed Eve. I haven't the
: lightest doubt that when Excom
hears of this, they will avjard me
a medal for extreme duty in the
face of action.
My Idea is to transform Lake
Lagunita into the Waikiki Beach
of Stanford. For this yet I may
even get a statue. The greatest

part of this idea is that it won't cost anyone a cent—
not one red, capitalistic cent. So, Excom, you can go
ahead and appoint your Rome delegate.
The transformation will, however, take the co-op
eration of every student on campus. It's a big order
and is going to require the work of everyone. You
can't just wish these things to happen.
Here's the way we're going to work it. First of all,
every person who drives to a beach around here, or
anywhere else for that matter, is to bring back at least
one box of sand. Good stuff, not just dirt! Then we
will dump the sand on the south (I still say the east
wing of Encina is south) shore of Lake Lag. This is
where our plan will take shape. If everyone does as
he's told, we may extend the beach to the road at the
back of the Lake, but for now we'll start small.
Next, now here's where we may run into a lot of
work, hut it'll be loads of fun—we'll take all of the
palm trees on Palm Drive and transplant them in
the sand around the "beach." Those trees aren't
doing anybody any good where they are now, and
we need them for atmosphere. If that's not enough,
I've got two out in front of my tong tepee that every
one's achin' to get rid of.
Anticipating the laziness that appears when there's
work to be done, I've hit upon a plan to make this
part of my Idea fun for all. We'll set one day aside,
sort of a holiday, and everyone will get together and
have all kinds of fun laughing and joking and pulling
up trees on the Drive.
After we get all the trees up—it may take all morn-

ing—we'll hold a great parade from Palm Drive
(they'll probably have to rename it Palmless Drive) to
Lake Lag.
I can picture it now; the Indian Band in full uni
form will lead the way, playing the Stanford fight
song, and behind them will he a line of two dozen
fire-engine-red Cadillac convertibles slowly drag
ging the palm trees. All along the way Stanford
students will line the sidewalks, yelling and cheer
ing and waving Stanford banners. Brings tears to
my eyes to think about it.
In the late afternoon, after the parade and when the
trees are all up at Lake Lag, there will be a big plant
ing ceremony.
President Sterling will put the first tree in the
ground while the Band plays the Stanford Hymn and
everyone will pitch in and plant the rest of the trees.
That night in a big celebration fireworks will be set
off all around the Lake while the women's swimming
team performs an aquatic ballet in the middle of the
Lake.
Pretty good Idea, huh? But my Idea doesn't stop
there. We've still got to make the beach Waikikiish,
.so I've come up with a few more bright little plans.'
For the first plan we'll need a couple of dozen
girl volunteers. I will personally take charge of
this, as it is an important cog in the machine. The
girls will be taught the hula, given grass skirts and
doohingies, and then will take turns hulaing beneath
the swaying palm trees every afternoon to the soft
music of ukeleles.
Another plan of mine is to set up a large stand on
the beach where Aloha shirts and ukeleles will be sold.
Free lessons on the uke, too—Hawaiian music only.
Aiso at this stand or perhaps at another one, instead
ol hot dogs, cokes, and candy bars, sliced pineapple,
papaya juice, and fresh shredded coconut will be sold.
I've thought about this Idea for a long time—what
nightmares—and so far as I can see, there's no hitch
to it, unless, of course, we can't get the Cadillacs. But,
believe me, it 11 be a great boon to the campus. Just
think of the money saved in not having to drive all
the way to the ocean. And all the time saved so that
there will be more time for studying.
And just think of those hula girls.

a success of it, we have to start right away.

this, as it is an important cog in the machine. The
girls will be taught the hula, given grass skirts and
doohingies, and then will take turns hulaing beneath
the swaying palm trees every afternoon to the soft
music of ukeleles.
Another plan of mine is to set up a large stand on
the beach where Aloha shirts and ukeleles will be sold.
Free lessons on the uke, too—Hawaiian music only.
Aiso at this stand or perhaps at another one, instead
ol hot dogs, cokes, and candy bars, sliced pineapple,
papaya juice, and fresh shredded coconut will be sold.
I've thought about this Idea for a long time—what
nightmares—and so far as I can see, there's no hitch
to it, unless, of course, we can't get the Cadillacs. But,
believe me, it 11 be a great boon to the campus. Just
think of the money saved in not having to drive all
the way to the ocean. And all the time saved so that
there will be more time for studying.
And just think of those hula girls.

It may seem a bit early for this, but if we're to make
a success of it, we have to start right away.
Lounging around in my red and white long handles
(if that ain't respect for me almo tomato, what is?)
and my mink-trimmed ear muffs the other day, I came

upon the greatest idea since Adam
glimpsed Eve. I haven't the
: lightest doubt that when Excom
hears of this, they will avjard me
a medal for extreme duty in the
face of action.
My Idea is to transform Lake
Lagunita into the Waikiki Beach
of Stanford. For this yet I may
even get a statue. The greatest

part of this idea is that it won't cost anyone a cent—
not one red, capitalistic cent. So, Excom, you can go
ahead and appoint your Rome delegate.
The transformation will, however, take the co-op
eration of every student on campus. It's a big order
and is going to require the work of everyone. You
can't just wish these things to happen.
Here's the way we're going to work it. First of all,
every person who drives to a beach around here, or
anywhere else for that matter, is to bring back at least
one box of sand. Good stuff, not just dirt! Then we
will dump the sand on the south (I still say the east
wing of Encina is south) shore of Lake Lag. This is
where our plan will take shape. If everyone does as
he's told, we may extend the beach to the road at the
back of the Lake, but for now we'll start small.
Next, now here's where we may run into a lot of
work, hut it'll be loads of fun—we'll take all of the
palm trees on Palm Drive and transplant them in
the sand around the "beach." Those trees aren't
doing anybody any good where they are now, and
we need them for atmosphere. If that's not enough,
I've got two out in front of my tong tepee that every
one's achin' to get rid of.
Anticipating the laziness that appears when there's
work to be done, I've hit upon a plan to make this
part of my Idea fun for all. We'll set one day aside,
sort of a holiday, and everyone will get together and
have all kinds of fun laughing and joking and pulling
up trees on the Drive.
After we get all the trees up—it may take all morn-

ing—we'll hold a great parade from Palm Drive
(they'll probably have to rename it Palmless Drive) to
Lake Lag.
I can picture it now; the Indian Band in full uni
form will lead the way, playing the Stanford fight
song, and behind them will he a line of two dozen
fire-engine-red Cadillac convertibles slowly drag
ging the palm trees. All along the way Stanford
students will line the sidewalks, yelling and cheer
ing and waving Stanford banners. Brings tears to
my eyes to think about it.
In the late afternoon, after the parade and when the
trees are all up at Lake Lag, there will be a big plant
ing ceremony.
President Sterling will put the first tree in the
ground while the Band plays the Stanford Hymn and
everyone will pitch in and plant the rest of the trees.
That night in a big celebration fireworks will be set
off all around the Lake while the women's swimming
team performs an aquatic ballet in the middle of the
Lake.
Pretty good Idea, huh? But my Idea doesn't stop
there. We've still got to make the beach Waikikiish,
.so I've come up with a few more bright little plans.'

form will lead the way, playing the Stanford fight
song, and behind them will he a line of two dozen
fire-engine-red Cadillac convertibles slowly drag
ging the palm trees. All along the way Stanford
students will line the sidewalks, yelling and cheer
ing and waving Stanford banners. Brings tears to
my eyes to think about it.
In the late afternoon, after the parade and when the
trees are all up at Lake Lag, there will be a big plant
ing ceremony.
President Sterling will put the first tree in the
ground while the Band plays the Stanford Hymn and
everyone will pitch in and plant the rest of the trees.
That night in a big celebration fireworks will be set
off all around the Lake while the women's swimming
team performs an aquatic ballet in the middle of the
Lake.
Pretty good Idea, huh? But my Idea doesn't stop
there. We've still got to make the beach Waikikiish,
.so I've come up with a few more bright little plans.'
For the first plan we'll need a couple of dozen
girl volunteers. I will personally take charge of
this, as it is an important cog in the machine. The
girls will be taught the hula, given grass skirts and
doohingies, and then will take turns hulaing beneath
the swaying palm trees every afternoon to the soft
music of ukeleles.
Another plan of mine is to set up a large stand on
the beach where Aloha shirts and ukeleles will be sold.
Free lessons on the uke, too—Hawaiian music only.
Aiso at this stand or perhaps at another one, instead
ol hot dogs, cokes, and candy bars, sliced pineapple,
papaya juice, and fresh shredded coconut will be sold.
I've thought about this Idea for a long time—what
nightmares—and so far as I can see, there's no hitch
to it, unless, of course, we can't get the Cadillacs. But,
believe me, it 11 be a great boon to the campus. Just
think of the money saved in not having to drive all
the way to the ocean. And all the time saved so that
there will be more time for studying.
And just think of those hula girls.

It may seem a bit early for this, but if we're to make
a success of it, we have to start right away.
Lounging around in my red and white long handles
(if that ain't respect for me almo tomato, what is?)
and my mink-trimmed ear muffs the other day, I came

upon the greatest idea since Adam
glimpsed Eve. I haven't the
: lightest doubt that when Excom
hears of this, they will avjard me
a medal for extreme duty in the
face of action.
My Idea is to transform Lake
Lagunita into the Waikiki Beach
of Stanford. For this yet I may
even get a statue. The greatest

part of this idea is that it won't cost anyone a cent—
not one red, capitalistic cent. So, Excom, you can go
ahead and appoint your Rome delegate.
The transformation will, however, take the co-op
eration of every student on campus. It's a big order
and is going to require the work of everyone. You
can't just wish these things to happen.
Here's the way we're going to work it. First of all,
every person who drives to a beach around here, or
anywhere else for that matter, is to bring back at least
one box of sand. Good stuff, not just dirt! Then we
will dump the sand on the south (I still say the east
wing of Encina is south) shore of Lake Lag. This is
where our plan will take shape. If everyone does as
he's told, we may extend the beach to the road at the
back of the Lake, but for now we'll start small.
Next, now here's where we may run into a lot of
work, hut it'll be loads of fun—we'll take all of the
palm trees on Palm Drive and transplant them in
the sand around the "beach." Those trees aren't
doing anybody any good where they are now, and
we need them for atmosphere. If that's not enough,
I've got two out in front of my tong tepee that every
one's achin' to get rid of.
Anticipating the laziness that appears when there's
work to be done, I've hit upon a plan to make this
part of my Idea fun for all. We'll set one day aside,
sort of a holiday, and everyone will get together and
have all kinds of fun laughing and joking and pulling
up trees on the Drive.
After we get all the trees up—it may take all morn-

ing—we'll hold a great parade from Palm Drive
(they'll probably have to rename it Palmless Drive) to
Lake Lag.
