## Frosh Social Reply

To the Editor:
In reply to the letter of March 2. 1951, by Bob Weeks
and Mike Markey:
first question is "where are our class dues
; :g3lng?" Simple reasoning explains that every organ
-1 ziation needs finances to conduct its activities; Eneina
TTall and the class of '54 are not exceptions. Encina has
added club dues to your room bill. This money fi
nances wing activities and Encina social functions.
Class dues are being collected by Frosh Excom
Ihrough the wing presidents. This $4 will finance class
activities for our years here at Stanford—the Frosh-
Soph Jamboree, the ''Fifty Forum," our class paper,
and this spring's beach party; these are examples of
this years activities. We still have three years to go.
Have you paid your class dues?
As to your question of "efficient planning" by the
Encina dance committee: the fireside was pur
posely planned on a weekend when many students
would be away. This gave those who would be here
a place to go. At no time was any large crowd ex
pected.
I he Dance Committee has not been haphazard about
planning this formal. Much time was spent to make
• Ins a "spectacular Winter Formal." Encina Lounge
was not chosen as a last resort. The wing chairmen
voted for Encina for many reasons: It can be deco
rated much more effectively, it is easily accessible,
and it cuts rental fees, making tickets less expensive!
Now they feel that they can bring you a better dance.
Remember, the place and the expense of a dance are
not the only things that make it "terrific."
A dance or any other activity has to be supported to
Le successful. Have you planned to support the dance 7
Have you paid your dues? Support these activities
and you will have a fair guarantee that they will be
terrific.

Encina Dance Committee
n,ie r)a,, y deserves a spanking for failing to

check completely on readers Weeks' and Markey's
information as printed in last Friday's paper. After
a belated check, it was found that the dance com
mittee changed the date only once—from Feb. 2.J to
March 10—and not three times as believed by Weeks
and Markey. Moreover, the date was changed bet
ter than a month before March 10.
(Also, it was learned that the band for the dance
was secured seven weeks in advance, and that at
that time the committee began looking for a location
off-campus, which it was subsequently unable to
find. The committee did not wait until three weeks
before dance time, as erroneously reported by
Weeks and Markey.—The Editor)
