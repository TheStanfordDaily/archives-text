To the Editor:
Upon reading the review of the Nelson Eddy con
cert in the Stanford Daily I was struck by the patron
izing air throughout the article. It smacked of a con
descension that was very distasteful to me. I believe
we all have a right to our opinions, right or wrong, but
I am sure there must have been a more gracious way
to express them.
I got the idea thai the writer wanted to convey
tin* impression that he was accustomed only to the
finest, and was mentally comparing Mr. Eddy's pre
sentation to that which might have been given by
a Metropolitan star. Mr. Eddy stands high in his
a concert singer and his audience certainly
appreciated his performance.
II so little was apparently expected of Mr. Eddv I
am surprised that Stanford made the engagement I
myself appreciated and enjoyed the concert immense
y. though Mi\ Eddy gave a very fine presentation
ile was sincere and gracious throughout.
