CONGRATULATIONS, COACH—Frosh cage coach Bob Bur
nett (left) rushes up to congratulate varsity mentor Everett Dean
at the conclusion of Saturday's night's hectic battle. Coach Dean
is shown still reading the scoreboard, which read Stanford 57,
California 56. Burnett, in turn, received congratulations for his
team's 68 to 49 win over the Cal yearlings. In the photo at the


right Stanford's Jim Walsh (4) is shown reaching for the casaba
while Cal's Ricksen twins, Rupe (5) and John (3) close in. This
fast-moving action took place under the Stanford bucket half
way through the second half of Saturday's finale at Berkeley.
