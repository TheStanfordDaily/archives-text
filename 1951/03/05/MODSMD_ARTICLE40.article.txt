The varsity linksnien opened their
season with a 27 to 0 shut-out of
Moffett Field. The Cards' Dick Mc-
Elyea, 1950 PCC champion, turned
in the outstanding performance of
the day, coming from behind in the?
last four holes to win his match. In
so doing, McElyea turned in the low
score of the day, 71.
