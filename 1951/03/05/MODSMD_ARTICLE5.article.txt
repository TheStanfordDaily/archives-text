# Two Victories by Indians Knock Bears to Basement
## Double Win Ends Season 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketeers
added a smashing finale to the
1951 cage drama when they
trampled the California Bears 75
to 57 on the Cow Palace stage
Friday, then hung on for a 57 to
56 decision in Saturday eve's
curtain-dropper in the Berkeley
arena.
The double win gave the Cards
an overall 12 and 14 record for the J
season, and a 5 and 7 Southern Di- j
vision mark which netted them i
third place in the final rankings. I
Cal gained undisputed cellar occu- {
pancy by virtue of the double hu- j
miliation.
It was the supreme effort of the !
year for the hustling but under
manned Redskins. Stanford's top
six men, who rank with any in the 1
Conference, played practically the
entire Cow Palace contest as they j
out-hustled, out-fought, out-re- t
hounded, out-defensed, and best
of all. out-scored the men of Ber- |
keley.
Saturday, playing mostly on nerve j
after the fatiguing Friday effort, ]
Everett Dean's charges battled on j
even terms all night against a fresh- .
cr Cal team that enjoyed the further j
advantage of playing before a mon
strous and noisy home crowd.
These Bear advantages were al
most enough to deny the Cards the j
fruits of their all-out effort. Cali
fornia pulled up to within one point j
when Larry Horan dropped a hook !
with one minute left; and he tried |
another, after stealing the ball from
the stalling Indians, with just three
seconds remaining. But this time it
was no go, and the final Bear hope
for a third-place tie vanished into
the smoke-filled Men's Gym atmos
phere.
Stanford's hi« four of Ed Tuck
er. Jim Ramstcad, Jim Walsh, and
Captain Jack O'Sullivan led the
weekend basket parade for the
victors. In the Cow Palace,
Tuckcr (23), Ramstcad (18), and
O'Sullivan (16) matched the en
tire California output of 57 points.
Walsh was high in Berkeley with
16 points, half on free throws, as j
Tucker netted 15, O'Sullivan 13, and
Ramstcad 12.

USC and UCLA, which split
their two games over the weekend
to finish the regular Southern Di- '
vision season in a first-place tie.
will play off the deadlock in
Westwood tonight. The winner
will meet Washington in Seattle |
this weekend for the conference
championship.

Tucker's 38 points gave him a
confcrcnce total of 200, just eight
behind Division scoring champ Dick
Ridgcway, who tanked 31 as his
team split with USC.
The much-heralded scoring duel
between Tucker and Cal's Bill Hag
ler was won in a walk by the Card
forward. But Hagler, in tallying 13
and 17 in the two nights, did man
age to set four new all-time Califor
nia scoring marks, to the delight of
the howling Berkeley mob.
It was the hard-driving play of
Hagler Saturday night that spelled
the difference between the two eve
nings' scores. Although Jim Ram-

defensive hold of the year on the
lanky Bear, Hagler refused to be
stopped in his final showing before
the home folks.
Forced by the drifting Card de
fense to shoot from farther out than
is his usual custom, Hagler never
theless scored enough points to tie
as the fourth highest scorer in all
time PCC annals (445 over three
years), set a new four-year Cal rec
ord of 1,274, and a new Berkeley
one-season conference mark of 177.
Bob See, the second Bear of the
first five who closed out his colle
giate career did almost
as well as Hagler in his farewell
performance. See, hailed by Stan
ford Coach Everett Dean as the
finest long-shot artist in the con
ference, swished a total of 29 in the
two nights.
O'Sullivan was the only Indian
who wound up his playing days at
Berkeley. He contributed 13 points

for a weekend total of 29.

The much-heralded scoring duel

Friday, then hung on for a 57 to

third place in the final rankings. I
Cal gained undisputed cellar occu- {

Stanford's varsity basketeers
added a smashing finale to the
1951 cage drama when they
trampled the California Bears 75
to 57 on the Cow Palace stage
Friday, then hung on for a 57 to
56 decision in Saturday eve's
curtain-dropper in the Berkeley
arena.
The double win gave the Cards
an overall 12 and 14 record for the J
season, and a 5 and 7 Southern Di- j
vision mark which netted them i
third place in the final rankings. I
Cal gained undisputed cellar occu- {
pancy by virtue of the double hu- j
miliation.
It was the supreme effort of the !
year for the hustling but under
manned Redskins. Stanford's top
six men, who rank with any in the 1
Conference, played practically the
entire Cow Palace contest as they j
out-hustled, out-fought, out-re- t
hounded, out-defensed, and best
of all. out-scored the men of Ber- |
keley.
Saturday, playing mostly on nerve j
after the fatiguing Friday effort, ]
Everett Dean's charges battled on j
even terms all night against a fresh- .
cr Cal team that enjoyed the further j
advantage of playing before a mon
strous and noisy home crowd.
These Bear advantages were al
most enough to deny the Cards the j
fruits of their all-out effort. Cali
fornia pulled up to within one point j
when Larry Horan dropped a hook !
with one minute left; and he tried |
another, after stealing the ball from
the stalling Indians, with just three
seconds remaining. But this time it
was no go, and the final Bear hope
for a third-place tie vanished into
the smoke-filled Men's Gym atmos
phere.
Stanford's hi« four of Ed Tuck
er. Jim Ramstcad, Jim Walsh, and
Captain Jack O'Sullivan led the
weekend basket parade for the
victors. In the Cow Palace,
Tuckcr (23), Ramstcad (18), and
O'Sullivan (16) matched the en
tire California output of 57 points.
Walsh was high in Berkeley with
16 points, half on free throws, as j
Tucker netted 15, O'Sullivan 13, and
Ramstcad 12.

USC and UCLA, which split
their two games over the weekend
to finish the regular Southern Di- '
vision season in a first-place tie.
will play off the deadlock in
Westwood tonight. The winner
will meet Washington in Seattle |
this weekend for the conference
championship.

Tucker's 38 points gave him a
confcrcnce total of 200, just eight
behind Division scoring champ Dick
Ridgcway, who tanked 31 as his
team split with USC.
The much-heralded scoring duel
between Tucker and Cal's Bill Hag
ler was won in a walk by the Card
forward. But Hagler, in tallying 13
and 17 in the two nights, did man
age to set four new all-time Califor
nia scoring marks, to the delight of
the howling Berkeley mob.
It was the hard-driving play of
Hagler Saturday night that spelled

for a third-place tie vanished into
the smoke-filled Men's Gym atmos

Stanford's hi« four of Ed Tuck

Ramstcad 12.

Tucker's 38 points gave him a
confcrcnce total of 200, just eight
behind Division scoring champ Dick
Ridgcway, who tanked 31 as his
team split with USC.
The much-heralded scoring duel
between Tucker and Cal's Bill Hag

forward. But Hagler, in tallying 13
and 17 in the two nights, did man
age to set four new all-time Califor

the howling Berkeley mob.
It was the hard-driving play of
Hagler Saturday night that spelled
the difference between the two eve

Stanford's varsity basketeers
added a smashing finale to the
1951 cage drama when they
trampled the California Bears 75
to 57 on the Cow Palace stage
Friday, then hung on for a 57 to
56 decision in Saturday eve's
curtain-dropper in the Berkeley
arena.
The double win gave the Cards
an overall 12 and 14 record for the J
season, and a 5 and 7 Southern Di- j
vision mark which netted them i
third place in the final rankings. I
Cal gained undisputed cellar occu- {
pancy by virtue of the double hu- j
miliation.
It was the supreme effort of the !
year for the hustling but under
manned Redskins. Stanford's top
six men, who rank with any in the 1
Conference, played practically the
entire Cow Palace contest as they j
out-hustled, out-fought, out-re- t
hounded, out-defensed, and best
of all. out-scored the men of Ber- |
keley.
Saturday, playing mostly on nerve j
after the fatiguing Friday effort, ]
Everett Dean's charges battled on j
even terms all night against a fresh- .
cr Cal team that enjoyed the further j
advantage of playing before a mon
strous and noisy home crowd.
These Bear advantages were al
most enough to deny the Cards the j
fruits of their all-out effort. Cali
fornia pulled up to within one point j
when Larry Horan dropped a hook !
with one minute left; and he tried |
another, after stealing the ball from
the stalling Indians, with just three
seconds remaining. But this time it
was no go, and the final Bear hope
for a third-place tie vanished into
the smoke-filled Men's Gym atmos
phere.
