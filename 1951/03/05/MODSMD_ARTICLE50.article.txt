# Ruggers Edge Bears; Earn Tie for Crown

### 
A last-minute drop kick by Russ
Latham gave Stanford a 12 to 9 rug-

by victory over California Saturday
in the Stadium, gaining Stanford a
tie with Cal for the 1951 Pacific
Soast championship. Cal took a 6
to 3 decision over the Cards Thurs
day up at Berkeley.
Latham's drop kick came with ex
actly one minute and 42 seconds left
in the game. Four minutes before,
a 48-yard penalty kick by Latham
knotted the score at 9 to 9. From
then on it was all Stanford. The
forwards, showing amazing aggres
siveness, kept the ball deep in Cal
territory and it was only the great
kicking of Max Howell that kept the
Cards at bay.
Finally Latham fielded a high
punt by Howell, looked around, and
with two Cal men charging on him,
calmly drop-kicked the ball some 30
yards for the final score.
The Indians started the game with
determination, as they kept the ball

in Bear territory for the first 12
minutes of the game.
