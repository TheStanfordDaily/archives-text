# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## With silica, water and imagination Du Pont scientists have found How to Tame Slippery Floors 
### 
Teen-agers in high schools used to
have great, if hazardous, fun running
and sliding on newly waxed corridor
floors. Of late many of them haven't
been able to do that. For numerous
schools, as well as office buildings
and institutions, are now using waxes
that have been made skid-resistant.
The product that is taming slip
pery floors is "Ludox" colloidal silica
—adapted by Du Pont chemists to
floor wax through cooperative re
•search with the wax industry.
If you mix plain sand with floor
wax, you'll have an anti-slip surface,
but it would be unsightly and thor
oughly impractical. With "Ludox,"
you arc using a water suspension of
invisible colloidal silica particles less
than a millionth of an inch in diam
eter.
A problem child
"Ludox" was quite a problem child
to scientists who developed it. For
instance, research men had to know
how silica would act in the presence
of floor wax. So they turned to the
electron microscope and learned that
the little silica spheres attach them
selves firmly to the surfaces of wax
spheres five times their size.
But it was also necessary to find
out how "Ludox" affects a waxy film

after it is laid down on a floor. While
a polished waxed floor looks smooth
enough, it is actually a series of hills
and valleys and these irregularities
have an important bearing on the
behavior of a surface.
Working with a waxed surface pre
sented difficulties. The electron mi
croscope functions only if electron
beams can pass through the mem
brane upon which the specimen is
placed. And electrons can't "sec
through" a floor!

Study in duplication

Often, problems like this have been
solved by preparing a thin replica or
copy of the surface for examination
in its stead. However, the conven
tional method for making a replica—

the one frequently used in studying
metals —requires solvents. These
would dissolve and ruin a wax surface.

So it became necessary for the
chemists and electron microscopists
to develop an entirely new way to
make a replica of a surface. This they
did, as part of a research program
that lasted several years.
With it some remarkable pictures
were made. They showed that many
"Ludox" particlcs stay at the sur
face of a wax film, even though they
are denser than wax. As you walk on
a floor, your shoe presses the tiny
silica particles down into the wax
spheres that make up the film. This
sets up a snubbing action which keeps
you from slipping.

Much more could be told about
Du Pont research on colloidal silica.
For example, chemical and mechan
ical engineers had to develop manu
facturing equipment, including a spe
cially designed ion exchange column.
Organic and physical chemists used
research findings to formulate better
waxes, as well as silica-containing
adhesives and anti-slip treatments
for rayon fabrics. Like practically all
Du Pont achievements, "Ludox" is
the result of close, continuous team
work of men and women trained in
many fields of science.

it costs more than $10,000 on the average to
provide the tools, machines, tactory space
and working capital for an American worker.
Du Pont's average operating investment per
employee is $17,800.
