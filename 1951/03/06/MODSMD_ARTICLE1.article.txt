# SENATE VOTES 18-YEAR-OLD DRAFT BILL
## Sets 24-Month Service Term 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 5 (UP) â€”The Senate voted in effect today
to draft 18-year-olds for 24 months of service after rejecting a Re
publican proposal which would have fixed the bottom induction
age at ISV2.
The action was both a victory and a defeat for President Truman

and bus top military chiefs who had
wanted fo draft 18-year-old youths
for 27 months in uniform. The draft
term, now pegged at 21 months,
would apply to all draftees.
The 24-months service period was
advanced by Chairman Richard B.
Russell, D., Ga., of the Senate Armed
Services Committee after Senator
Wayne Morse, R., Ore., stood firm on
hLs demand that the draft term be
left at 21 months.
Morse, who also sponsored the IBV2
amendment, promptly conceded he
didn't have the votes to swing his
proposal and accepted the compro
mise. It was adopted by voice vote
after only a brief debate. The cham
ber then rejected another Morse pro
posal which would have limited to
18 months the tour of service of re
servists recalled to uniform.
Morse contended the administra
tion had failed to prove it needs the
youths to meet the President's goal of
bringing 3,500,000 men under arms as
soon after July 1 as possible.
While the administration originally
asked for a 27-months draft, the
Armed Services Committee shaved it
down to 26 months before sending
the measure to the Senate floor. The
Senate's action would fix it at 24
months.
While youths could be inducted at
18 under the Senate bill, they would
have to be given at least 16 weeks'
training before being sent into com
bat. The measure also provides for
a universal military training pro
gi*am after the current emergency.
