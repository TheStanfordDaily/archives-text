# 'Y' STUDENT WORKSHOP
## Counselor Balch Suggests Improvements of Activities 
### 
Fifty students, representing 18
organizations, comprised the
annual YWCA Student Work-;
shop which met last Friday and j
Saturday to analyze problems
faced by the various groups and
presented to the workshop for
discussion.
Richard Raich, Chief Counselor
for Men, principal speaker at the
Friday afternoon session, outlined
his ideas on the six proposals pre- }
sented for discussion.
Concerning the failures of the
relief drives, Balch said thai there
was no "philosophy of giving"
among the students. They felt no
real purpose for giving, and there- j
fore lacked the spirit needed to
make the affair a success.
Raich suggested that the period of I
fall prc-reg he more of an academic
rather than social nature so that j
students would not get an entirely j
wrong idea of college life in their j
first few weeks on campus.
In regards to a proposal that re
ligious groups he organized on cam
pus, he said that he was opposed
because they arc closed groups and
all present organizations are open
to everyone.
He lauded the leadership training i
conferences nnd said that the gen- l
eral education received at Stanford ,

was helping to develop leadership.
Batch expressed his disapproval
of organizations which would du
plicate each other's iohs. These
included the establishment of an
Associated Men Students' organi
zation and the public relations
office.
Ted Ruttner, ASSU president.,
arted as chairman of the final ses
sion held Saturday afternoon when
the recommendations for solution of
the various problems were pre
sented.
It was suggested that the failure
j of such events as the Louis Arm
| strong dance and the Homecoming
Dance to draw more students could
be remedied by having just one big
function a year, preferably ofT cam
pus. This affair should have appeal
to all groups of students, and not be
specialized like the Louis Arm-
I strong affair.
An alternative to this sugges
tion was the idea that Cardinals
subsidize various smaller func
tions and that permanent proper
ties he purchased for the Pavilion
since that is the onlv place on
campus for such activities.
Two, instead of three, elections
per year was the solution offered to
the problem of getting more stu
dents to participate in elections. It
was suggested that students ap
pointed to fill vacated offices serve
for three months instead of one. A
| system for having more seniors on

Men's and Women's Councils was
also presented.
Recommendations for other prob
lems included:
1. Regular standing committee to
be formed by Excom to plan and
execute all relief drives.
2. Daily Ir» give niorc space to
world affairs.
.*». Freshman orientation to con
tinue into winter and spring quar
ters as well as fall.
4. Supplement lo Frosh Bible he
published consisting of a list of or
ganizations and activities.
5. An Inter-Cluh Council to he
; formed lo make the ideas and
plans of each organization known
to all.
6. Off-campus women to have an
cx-officio member on Excom.
7. Better representation of living
groups in Rally Com.
8. Reorganization of Rally Com;
should function all three quarters
and not just during football sea
j son.
D. Yell leaders to speak on sports
manship at living groups to impress
on the student body that it is an
ambassador of Stanford spirit.
In evaluation of the workshop, it
was suggested that the whole work
shop be held in one day, that it
should have more publicit}', and
that more organizations should as
-1 sist the "Y" in planning the work-
I shop.

In evaluation of the workshop, it
was suggested that the whole work
shop be held in one day, that it
should have more publicit}', and
that more organizations should as
-1 sist the "Y" in planning the work-
I shop.
Fifty students, representing 18
organizations, comprised the
annual YWCA Student Work-;
shop which met last Friday and j
Saturday to analyze problems
faced by the various groups and
presented to the workshop for
discussion.
Richard Raich, Chief Counselor
for Men, principal speaker at the
Friday afternoon session, outlined
his ideas on the six proposals pre- }
sented for discussion.
Concerning the failures of the
relief drives, Balch said thai there
was no "philosophy of giving"
among the students. They felt no
real purpose for giving, and there- j
fore lacked the spirit needed to
make the affair a success.
Raich suggested that the period of I
fall prc-reg he more of an academic
rather than social nature so that j
students would not get an entirely j
wrong idea of college life in their j
first few weeks on campus.
In regards to a proposal that re
ligious groups he organized on cam
pus, he said that he was opposed
because they arc closed groups and
all present organizations are open
to everyone.
He lauded the leadership training i
conferences nnd said that the gen- l
eral education received at Stanford ,

was helping to develop leadership.
Batch expressed his disapproval
of organizations which would du
plicate each other's iohs. These
included the establishment of an
Associated Men Students' organi
zation and the public relations
office.
Ted Ruttner, ASSU president.,
arted as chairman of the final ses
sion held Saturday afternoon when
the recommendations for solution of
the various problems were pre
sented.
It was suggested that the failure
j of such events as the Louis Arm
| strong dance and the Homecoming
Dance to draw more students could
be remedied by having just one big
function a year, preferably ofT cam
pus. This affair should have appeal
to all groups of students, and not be
specialized like the Louis Arm-
I strong affair.
An alternative to this sugges
tion was the idea that Cardinals
subsidize various smaller func
tions and that permanent proper
ties he purchased for the Pavilion
since that is the onlv place on
campus for such activities.
Two, instead of three, elections
per year was the solution offered to
the problem of getting more stu
dents to participate in elections. It
was suggested that students ap
pointed to fill vacated offices serve
for three months instead of one. A
| system for having more seniors on

Men's and Women's Councils was
also presented.
Recommendations for other prob
lems included:
1. Regular standing committee to
