tween Fresno, Las Vegas, and
Santa Fe today for any sign of
the missing Stinson Air Station

where they were to refuel and con
tinue their flight on to Santa Fe.
They have not been heard from since
9:35 that same morning when they
checked in by radio at Fresno.
Civil Air Patrol planes from Fres
no, Air Force Reserve craft from Mc-
Clelland Field, and Navy training
planes from Chandler Field in Fresno
searched the area between Las Vegas
and Fresno yesterday.
An Army B-17 from Hamilton
Field patroled the flight lanes from
Las Vegas to Santa Fe to Albuquer
que and back. The Coast Guard also
sent a plane to the area around Mr.
Whitney.
Hamilton Field Air-Sea Rescue is
in charge of the search for the miss
ing craft, and has set up a field of
fice at Fresno.
According to a report received by
the Oakland Airway Traffic Control
Center, Norbury, an experienced
Navy and TWA pilot, had enough
fuel to last until 1:30 Friday after
noon. His estimated time of arrival
in Las Vegas was 12 noon.
Miss Breck was to remain in Santa
Fe to complete plans for her wedding
to Norbury on March 31. The two
men were to return to school Sunday.
