TOKYO, Tuesday, March fi (UP)
â€”The American Seventh Division
routed 6,000 Reds from their Shan
gri-La redoubt in the wilds of east
Korea yesterday and speared into
the nearby ruins of bomb-flattened
Changpyong.
The east wing of the Communist
line sagged back within 25 miles of
the 38th parallel under a rain of
blows by American, South Korean,
and French forces.
