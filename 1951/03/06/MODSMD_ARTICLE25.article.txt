# IFB Sticks to Its Guns
## 
### 
Last week, as announced in yesterday's
Daily, Interfraternity Board of Control killed an
IFC proposal which would have allowed in
formal initiations to be held outside the houses
and grounds of fraternities.
After hearing objections to the disputed
"Rule No. 3," which outlaws off-grounds infor
mal initiations, IFC came up with the proposed
solution that informal initiations outside the
house would be O.K.—if they were first passed
on by an IFC committee.
IFB vetoed the idea. The board's chief rea
sons seem to be these:
1. Unconstructive—lFß, in its experience as
top-dog of interfraternity legislation, does not
feel that any off-house informal initiations are
constructive. The National Interfraternity
Council agrees with this stand, and has so
stated.
We also would agree with IFB when it tells us
that the aim of initiation legislation is to con
fine "hell week" to the "constructive" vein. We
would concur again with its attempt to discour
age any initiations that might end in injury to
the fraternity system and the school.
2. Dangerous—insofar as IFB feels that any
proposed "check" on outside fraternity initia
tions by an IFC committee would be ineffec
tive, it contends that repeal of "Rule No. 3"
would in effect be asking fraternities to expose
themselves to a "bad name."
As one official put it yesterday, even if an
initiation looks good on paper, one irresponsi
ble or unthinking member can easily "go too
far" and everyone will in turn suffer. Such

things have happened too often in the past to
overrule this consideration.
As we see it, then, the only course open to
IFC, if it is to succeed, is to convince IFB that (1)
there ARE informal initiations (such as "quests"
and the like) that are constructive and can be
most effectively held off-campus; and (2) that
an IFC committee (or direct responsibility
within the fraternities themselves) CAN so
safeguard these activities as to make them a
credit and not a blemish on the fraternity rec
ord.
If IFC is really interested in turning over the
decision on informal initiations to those within
its own ranks, then there is nothing preventing
it from further discussion on the matter and re
submittal to IFB.
Personally, we feel there are merits to some
fraternity off-campus initiations. We also feel
that the "no hazing" rule and the disinclination
of fraternities to give themselves a "bad name"
are sufficient means with which to eliminate
those initiations which are damaging.
Above all, we don't want to see individual
fraternities violate "Rule No. 3" because they
feel they are morally justified and think the
rule absurd. Moreover, we don't want to see
them fined for so doing, as happened last quar
ter. Here, too, is an unhealthy state of affairs.
In short, we think there is a solution to the
"Rule No. 3" problem that is satisfying to both
IFC and IFB. But until it's found, we would
support the present ruling to the letter. Work
ing for the fraternities as it is, the board feels
it is steering the truest course.
