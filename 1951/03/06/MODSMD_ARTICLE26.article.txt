# Europe Travel Fever Infects Students; IIR Bureau Helps Make Summer Plans
## 
### JOAN SEAVER 
On an average of five a day,
Stanford students have been
coming to the lIR Travel Bureau
with an afternoon to spend on a
summer air-castle—each with a
tentative budget, a mental pic
ture of Europe, and already the
glint of the American tourist in
his eye.
How to see the most in the least
time for the lowest possible cost is
always the first question. The an
swer seems to be in most cases a
conducted tour—anywhere from a |
well-routed race between cultural
high points to a camper's holiday in
I he Alps and valleys of Europe.
There are some 60 listed student
tours and more are turning up ev- j
ery flay.
Europe by Ford
The"I would like to travel on
my own, but . . ." class of traveler
has inspired plans like the Student
Travel Overseas Program that will :
cover the bulk of Europe in 1851
Fords. Any four students can get '
together with their Scandinavian I
student chauffeur, follow a planned
circuit of the continent, and still
have the freedom of a solo voyage.
For Californians with a continent

to cross before they even start, the
Foreign Travel Council on Cal's
campus has dreamed up an odyssey
of 14 countries. Camel, bus, plane,
private coach, and gondola will
transport GO students from Califor
nia colleges for an average of five
cents a mile.
They will use mostly university
operated facilities abroad to pro
vide the Americans with a meeting
ground with foreign students. A
chartered DC-4 will take the group
from the Oakland airport and back
again in 77 days.
Concentrated Tours
For students with no taste for
marathons which sample a little of
everything everywhere, more con
centrated summers have been pro
posed. American Youth Hostels
plans a bicycle route in Scandinavia
or from the south of France to North
Africa and back to Italy.
The NSA takes groups to the na
tional festivals in Germany. Austria,
Switzerland, and Scotland, operat
ing on the principle that annual
festival crowds offer as cosmopoli
tan a contact as touring 15 coun
tries.
More Women Travelers
The spectacular demand for con
ducted tours this year has one ob
vious cause—more women and few
er men are European bound. But
there are a few advantages aside

from the chaperonage and short
cuts a good guide can offer. Some
countries quote group rates to the
established student organizations.
Except through planned tours, low
cost transoceanic passage is virtu
ally closed for next summer.
The Marshall Plan offices in Paris
say that the days of free ocean
travel working as a stoker or waiter
or musician are almost over. Only
Maritime Union card holders are
working on U.S. ships. One student,
out of a known 2,000, waited for a
month in New York until a last
minute replacement was needed in
the dishwashing department of a
foreign liner. His was rare luck.
Conducted vs. Lone Tours
Alumni of the conducted tours
voice one major objection: Ameri
cans in mass are a hindrance to fa
miliarity with the natives of any
country. With some language abil
ity and a few contacts overseas,
students on their own have been
known to beat the conducted tour
rates, which may be $400 or 1,800.
The lIR will provide any Stanford
traveler with a handbook listing in
dividuals and organizations in Eu
rope and the two Americas who
have said they would welcome stu
dents to their countries. Some of
these have received SIRO aid; many
are alumni of student exchange pro
grams—all good landmarks for a
summer abroad.
