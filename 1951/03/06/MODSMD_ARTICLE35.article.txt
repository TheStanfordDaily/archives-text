# '54 Stanford Frosh Cagers Rank as 'Best Ever'
## Future Varsity Stars Lead '54ers To Seventeen Wins; Four Against Bears 
### PETE GROTHE 
Several weeks ago, Red Foley, St. Mary's basketball coach, ad
dressed the San Francisco Press Club, and said, approximately:
"Today, I'm not going to talk about my varsity. Today I'm just
going to tell you about my frosh. I wouldn't be surprised if we had
the best freshman team in the nation. They haven't lost a game

yet, and, gentlemen, I'm here to tell
you that they are sensational!"'
That night, the St. Mary's frosh,
"the best freshman team in the na
tion," met the Stanford freshman
team. Not only did Stanford mutilate
the undefeated yearlings, 79 to 56, but
they also tied a 35-year-old freshman
record for points scored. One week
later they scored 8(> points and broke
the all-time Stanford frosh record.
At the beginning of the season,
frosh coach Bob Burnett said, "This
is probably the best freshman team
since I came here in 1937." When
the season came to a close last
weekend, he amended bis state
ment: "This definitely IS the best
team since I came here in 1!)37."
Burnett added, "This year's fresh
man basketball team fulfilled in

every respect the advance publicity j
it received.
The Papooses' rccori" backs up
all the nicotics written and said
about them this year. Eighteen
times they ventured out of the
barn, and 17 times they came back
with the opposition scalp. Four of
those wins were against the Cal
frosh.
The Papooses tapped Cai 65 to 55,
(it to 54, (>S to 4M, and 6!) to 50. In
last Saturday's game, the finale of
the season, Cal had a .'l7 to 156 lead
with 14 minutes to go. It was the
first time all year, outside of the
USF game, that Burnett's boys had
been pressed. They were up to the
challenge and scored 32 points in
14 minutes.

One of the prime reasons for the
C'ardbabes' good fortunes was due to
the scoring abilities of Dave Epper- i
son, the six-foot, six-inch center.
! Epperson meshed 228 points in 17
j games for a 13.3 average.
The six foot four, 200-pound Don ;
Carlson is probably rated "most j
likely to succeed" in varsity eompe- '
| tion. Guard Carlson is especially
wicked on the backboards. lie has
J beautiful co-ordination for a big |
| man, and makes seemingly "impos- !
1 sible" shots under the basket.
When Epperson and Carlson were }
ailing or "flat'' it was co-captain Olie
SuzdalefT who pulled the team to- i
gether. His pet tricks are stealing the
ball from an unsuspecting opponent
and sinking on-the-run shots. In !
three of the four Cal games, he !
scored 17, 17, and 18 points.
Co-captain Don DeLong is the
froshs' version of Jack O'Sullivan.
Hal Ellis, DeLong's forward mate,
is not the spectacular type of player,
but he is consistent and a sftiooth
! floor man.

14 minutes.

One of the prime reasons for the
C'ardbabes' good fortunes was due to
the scoring abilities of Dave Epper- i
son, the six-foot, six-inch center.
! Epperson meshed 228 points in 17
j games for a 13.3 average.
The six foot four, 200-pound Don ;
Carlson is probably rated "most j
likely to succeed" in varsity eompe- '
| tion. Guard Carlson is especially
wicked on the backboards. lie has
J beautiful co-ordination for a big |
| man, and makes seemingly "impos- !
1 sible" shots under the basket.
When Epperson and Carlson were }
ailing or "flat'' it was co-captain Olie
SuzdalefT who pulled the team to- i
gether. His pet tricks are stealing the
ball from an unsuspecting opponent
and sinking on-the-run shots. In !
three of the four Cal games, he !
scored 17, 17, and 18 points.
Co-captain Don DeLong is the
froshs' version of Jack O'Sullivan.
Hal Ellis, DeLong's forward mate,
is not the spectacular type of player,

Several weeks ago, Red Foley, St. Mary's basketball coach, ad
dressed the San Francisco Press Club, and said, approximately:
"Today, I'm not going to talk about my varsity. Today I'm just
going to tell you about my frosh. I wouldn't be surprised if we had
the best freshman team in the nation. They haven't lost a game

yet, and, gentlemen, I'm here to tell
you that they are sensational!"'
That night, the St. Mary's frosh,
"the best freshman team in the na
tion," met the Stanford freshman
team. Not only did Stanford mutilate
the undefeated yearlings, 79 to 56, but
they also tied a 35-year-old freshman
record for points scored. One week
later they scored 8(> points and broke
the all-time Stanford frosh record.
At the beginning of the season,
frosh coach Bob Burnett said, "This
is probably the best freshman team
since I came here in 1937." When
the season came to a close last
weekend, he amended bis state
ment: "This definitely IS the best
team since I came here in 1!)37."
Burnett added, "This year's fresh
man basketball team fulfilled in

every respect the advance publicity j
it received.
The Papooses' rccori" backs up
all the nicotics written and said
about them this year. Eighteen
times they ventured out of the
barn, and 17 times they came back
with the opposition scalp. Four of
those wins were against the Cal
frosh.
The Papooses tapped Cai 65 to 55,
(it to 54, (>S to 4M, and 6!) to 50. In
last Saturday's game, the finale of
the season, Cal had a .'l7 to 156 lead

USF game, that Burnett's boys had
been pressed. They were up to the
