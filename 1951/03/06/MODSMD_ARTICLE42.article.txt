# Rugger Russ Latham An All-Time Stanford Great
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
It is always a gratifying experi
ence to witness perfection in an
athlete. Here at Stanford, we have
been fortunate enough to see the
great ones, during the last few
years: George Yardley, Bill McColl,
and Gay Bryan, to name a few.
There is another athlete now per
forming, however, who so domi
nates his sport that one cannot help
including him in the list of Stan
ford all-time greats. He is Russ La
tham. the brilliant three-quarters
back and mainstay of this year's
Pacific Coast co-championship rug
by team.
Russ, a chemical engineering grad
student, is no newcomer to the
game. He played three years of
high school rugby in British Co
lumbia, where rugby is somewhat
of a national sport. After high
school, he played a year for Victoria
College, being chosen for an all
star team, the Victoria Reps.
From there, he went on to letter
for four years at the University of
British Columbia. During his ten
ure, the Thunderbirds lost only one
game out of 40, winning 33 straight.
They won the Canada League Cup
all four years and the World Cup

three years. In the fall of 1950 Russ
came to Stanford.
He turned out for rugby and be
fore long he established himself as
one of the all-time greats in Stan
ford's history.
Against the Palo Alto Ramblers,
Stanford's first 1951 league oppo
nent, Latham scored on a beautiful
23-yard broken field run, and paced
the Cards to a 41-1G victory.
Against Petaluma he scored three
times on runs of 17, 20, and 42 yards.
Against UCLA he put Stanford into
the lead with a running drop-kick
from 35 yards out.
Against Cal up at Berkeley he
scored the lone Stanford tally, a
broken field run of 32 yards through
the mud, and against Cal here Sat
urday he broke a 9-9 tie with a drop
kick from the field 30 vards out. His
kick came with a minute and 42
seconds remaining in the game and
gave Stanford a 12-9 victory and a
tie for the Pacific Coast champion
ship.
Although the rugby season is al
ready over, Russ will be out again
next year, so those of you who like
to see the game played as it truly
should be, come out and watch.

broken field run of 32 yards through
the mud, and against Cal here Sat
urday he broke a 9-9 tie with a drop
kick from the field 30 vards out. His
kick came with a minute and 42
seconds remaining in the game and
gave Stanford a 12-9 victory and a
tie for the Pacific Coast champion
ship.
Although the rugby season is al
ready over, Russ will be out again
next year, so those of you who like
to see the game played as it truly
should be, come out and watch.


RUSS LATHAM
—Outstanding Rugger
It is always a gratifying experi
ence to witness perfection in an
athlete. Here at Stanford, we have
been fortunate enough to see the
great ones, during the last few
years: George Yardley, Bill McColl,
and Gay Bryan, to name a few.
There is another athlete now per
forming, however, who so domi
nates his sport that one cannot help
including him in the list of Stan
ford all-time greats. He is Russ La
tham. the brilliant three-quarters
back and mainstay of this year's
Pacific Coast co-championship rug
by team.
Russ, a chemical engineering grad
student, is no newcomer to the
game. He played three years of
high school rugby in British Co
lumbia, where rugby is somewhat
of a national sport. After high
school, he played a year for Victoria
College, being chosen for an all
star team, the Victoria Reps.
From there, he went on to letter
for four years at the University of
British Columbia. During his ten
ure, the Thunderbirds lost only one
game out of 40, winning 33 straight.
They won the Canada League Cup
all four years and the World Cup

three years. In the fall of 1950 Russ
came to Stanford.
He turned out for rugby and be
fore long he established himself as
one of the all-time greats in Stan
ford's history.
Against the Palo Alto Ramblers,
Stanford's first 1951 league oppo
nent, Latham scored on a beautiful
23-yard broken field run, and paced
the Cards to a 41-1G victory.
Against Petaluma he scored three
times on runs of 17, 20, and 42 yards.
Against UCLA he put Stanford into
the lead with a running drop-kick
from 35 yards out.
Against Cal up at Berkeley he
scored the lone Stanford tally, a
broken field run of 32 yards through
the mud, and against Cal here Sat
urday he broke a 9-9 tie with a drop
kick from the field 30 vards out. His
kick came with a minute and 42
seconds remaining in the game and
gave Stanford a 12-9 victory and a
tie for the Pacific Coast champion
ship.

ready over, Russ will be out again
next year, so those of you who like
