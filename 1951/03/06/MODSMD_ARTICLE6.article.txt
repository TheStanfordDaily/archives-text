# Solutions For Peace Discussed
## 
### 
Solutions ranging from "bat
their ears down" to "disarma
ment and the neutralization of
Germany" were presented last
night to meet the present Rus
sian challenge to peace. At an
ASSU Forum held in Cubberley
Auditorium a panel of four
speakers discussed proposals to
answer the guestion "World Co
operation—How?"
Speaking to an audience of ap
proximately 40, Professor Gordon F.
Ferris of the Biology Department
upheld the views of the Atlantic
Union Committee. He felt that So
viet principles, which conflict with
those of the West, can be opposed
only by force. And sufficient force
will best be achieved through unity
of Western democracies.
Thicrmann Disagrees
Stephen Thiermann, executive
secretary of the American Friends
Scrvice Committee for Northern
California, disagreed with the opin
ions of Professor Ferris. He said
that peace through preparedness is
a myth, and that the United States
"should create new historical condi
tions" in which Communist tenets
can be changed.
Among these "new historical con
ditions" would be neutralization of
Germany, investment to raise world
living standards, and disarmament.
UN Supported
Stanley Weigel, past state presi
dent of the United World Federal
ists, and Charles Allen, representing
the American Association for the
United Nations, agreed to a largt
extent in supporting the UN. Wei
gel said that the UWF advocates
a quick strengthening of the UN
into a partial federation.
In a question period at the end of
the program, moderated by Forum
Committee chairman Carl Stover,
Allen took exception to the disar
mafent proposal. It proved disas
trous, he said, in 1947 and '48.
Professor Ferris denounced his
colleagues as "impractical idealists."
They arc playing into the hands of
the Russians, he said, whose inten
tions are as obvious as those of Hit
ler before World War 11.
