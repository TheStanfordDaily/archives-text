# Draft Situation Brightens for Farm Students
## 
### 
Paradoxically, the possibility of
Stanford men finishing college be
fore being inducted into the service
became increasingly brighter yes
terday as the Senate voted to draft
18-year-olds.
According to Dean of Students
Donald Winbigler, it is not only pos
sible but probable that large num
bers of men classified 2-A and 1-A-
P will be allowed to finish college
before induction—depending in part
on whether or not an 18-year-old
draft of some type comes out of

Congress.
(Yesterday's Senate passage has
yet to be approved by the House
before going to the President for his
signature.)
Quoting a report from the Ameri
can Council of Higher Education,
the Dean said Selective Service will
draft 200,000 university students at
the end of this school year.
Most, if not all, of this quota will
probably come from the estimated
graduating class of 570,000 men stu
dents, he pointed out.

In addition, he said, the total
number of students who have joined
the service, plus the number who
join during the remainder of the
school year and when school ends,
will be subtracted from the 200,000
draft figure.
Considering these facts, plus the
fact that draft quotas may soon be
partly filled by 18-year-olds, Dean
Winbigler pointed out it is "very
likely" that all the 2-A's and 1-A-P's
now enrolled at Stanford will be al
lowed to finish their education.

An 18-year-old draft will affect
Stanford enrollment in another way,
Dean Winbigler said, but not in the
immediate future.
He said the draft will probably re
duce the freshman enrollment but
only by about 7Vs per cent, and that
not for a year or two.
Selective Service will not be able
ito classify and draft graduating high
school seniors in time to keep them
from enrolling next autumn, he said,
and after starting college, the stu
dents will be allowed to finish at

least that year.
A year after that, the students are
no longer 18, he pointed out, so they
might also be allowed to finish their
education, in so far as the 18-year
old draft law would no longer apply.
Men's Counselor Richard Balch,
commenting on next year's enroll
ment, said Stanford expects 600
freshmen as compared to 744 for
autumn, 1950.
Balch attributed this drop to the
low birth rate in the depression year
of 1932.
He said next year's freshmen

would probably swell the ROTC,
NROTC, and Air ROTC units by
300, and might even push the total
up as high as 1,200, as compared
with an enrollment of 744 this year.
Balch said he has repeatedly
urged students to join these pro
grams as a safe measure against be
ing inducted before finishing school.
He complimented Stanford men
for not yielding to the mass hysteria
which hit other colleges, causing
many to quit school and join the
services because of uncertain mili
tary status.

Balch said he has repeatedly
urged students to join these pro
grams as a safe measure against be
ing inducted before finishing school.
He complimented Stanford men
for not yielding to the mass hysteria
which hit other colleges, causing
many to quit school and join the
services because of uncertain mili
tary status.
Paradoxically, the possibility of
Stanford men finishing college be
fore being inducted into the service
became increasingly brighter yes
terday as the Senate voted to draft
18-year-olds.
According to Dean of Students
Donald Winbigler, it is not only pos
sible but probable that large num
bers of men classified 2-A and 1-A-
P will be allowed to finish college
before induction—depending in part
on whether or not an 18-year-old
draft of some type comes out of

Congress.
(Yesterday's Senate passage has
yet to be approved by the House
before going to the President for his
signature.)
Quoting a report from the Ameri
can Council of Higher Education,
the Dean said Selective Service will
draft 200,000 university students at
the end of this school year.
Most, if not all, of this quota will
probably come from the estimated
graduating class of 570,000 men stu
dents, he pointed out.

In addition, he said, the total
number of students who have joined
the service, plus the number who
join during the remainder of the
school year and when school ends,
will be subtracted from the 200,000
draft figure.
Considering these facts, plus the
fact that draft quotas may soon be
partly filled by 18-year-olds, Dean
Winbigler pointed out it is "very
likely" that all the 2-A's and 1-A-P's
now enrolled at Stanford will be al
lowed to finish their education.

An 18-year-old draft will affect
Stanford enrollment in another way,
Dean Winbigler said, but not in the
immediate future.
He said the draft will probably re
duce the freshman enrollment but
only by about 7Vs per cent, and that
not for a year or two.
Selective Service will not be able
ito classify and draft graduating high
school seniors in time to keep them
from enrolling next autumn, he said,
and after starting college, the stu
dents will be allowed to finish at

least that year.
A year after that, the students are
no longer 18, he pointed out, so they
might also be allowed to finish their
education, in so far as the 18-year
old draft law would no longer apply.
Men's Counselor Richard Balch,
commenting on next year's enroll
ment, said Stanford expects 600
freshmen as compared to 744 for
autumn, 1950.
Balch attributed this drop to the
low birth rate in the depression year
of 1932.
He said next year's freshmen

would probably swell the ROTC,
NROTC, and Air ROTC units by
300, and might even push the total
up as high as 1,200, as compared
with an enrollment of 744 this year.
