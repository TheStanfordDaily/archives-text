# Fire Whistle to Begin Civil Defense Alert
## 
### 
The Firehouse whistle—the same one you hear at 5 p.m. and for I
fires—will set this week's civil defense test alert into motion but
may not contain enough air in its tanks to do the job.
The whistle is to blow one long sustained blast of a minute or
more duration to signal the yellow alert, (which under actual con-

ditions would mean unidentified air
craft had been identified approach
ing), requiring in itself more air than
is required by the longest fire signal
blast.
The civil defense alert will also re
quire blasts to signal "red condition"
—a series of short blasts repeated for
three minutes; and an all-clear sig
nal — a series of three one-minute
blasts with two-minute intervals.
Under actual conditions, the red
condition would mean bombing ap
pears imminent.
Firemen said there is no way of
telling how long the air supply will
last; the surprise alert will answer
the question.
Rules for students and faculty to
observe during this week's surprise
civil defense trial alert are reprinted
below. Living groups are urged to
post the rules and the name of their
area wardens.
Alf Brandin, civil defense head,
emphasizes that ALL civil defense
personnel are to man their posts
when the yellow alert sounds. This
would mean interruption of classes
for instructors involved.
The rules:
Yellow alert:
1. All civilian defense personnel
man their posts.
2. Faculty and students not con
nected with civilian defense organ
ization will continue their regular ac
tivities.
3. All traffic to stop on campus
(except in Palo Alto Hospital area)
so that roads may be opened for
movement of CD personnel.
4. Telephones will be used for
emergency purposes only so that or
ders to and from the command cen
ter will not be interrupted.
Red alert:
1. If you are inside a building, get
away from window areas and stand
facing a wall.
2. Hallways can be used as shelters
but a passageway must be left open
for easy exit.
Living groups will observe their
regular house rules covering any
type of disaster.
4. If you are outside, get next to a
building to prevent effects of blast.
All clear: Resume normal opera
tions.

fires—will set this week's civil defense test alert into motion but
may not contain enough air in its tanks to do the job.
The whistle is to blow one long sustained blast of a minute or
more duration to signal the yellow alert, (which under actual con-

ditions would mean unidentified air
craft had been identified approach
ing), requiring in itself more air than
is required by the longest fire signal
blast.
The civil defense alert will also re
quire blasts to signal "red condition"
—a series of short blasts repeated for
three minutes; and an all-clear sig
nal — a series of three one-minute
blasts with two-minute intervals.
Under actual conditions, the red
condition would mean bombing ap
pears imminent.
Firemen said there is no way of
telling how long the air supply will
last; the surprise alert will answer
the question.
Rules for students and faculty to
observe during this week's surprise
civil defense trial alert are reprinted
below. Living groups are urged to
post the rules and the name of their
area wardens.
Alf Brandin, civil defense head,
emphasizes that ALL civil defense
personnel are to man their posts
when the yellow alert sounds. This
would mean interruption of classes
for instructors involved.
The rules:
Yellow alert:
1. All civilian defense personnel
man their posts.
2. Faculty and students not con
nected with civilian defense organ
ization will continue their regular ac
tivities.
3. All traffic to stop on campus
(except in Palo Alto Hospital area)
so that roads may be opened for
movement of CD personnel.
4. Telephones will be used for
emergency purposes only so that or
ders to and from the command cen
ter will not be interrupted.
Red alert:
1. If you are inside a building, get
away from window areas and stand
facing a wall.
2. Hallways can be used as shelters
but a passageway must be left open
for easy exit.
Living groups will observe their
regular house rules covering any
type of disaster.
4. If you are outside, get next to a
building to prevent effects of blast.
All clear: Resume normal opera
tions.
