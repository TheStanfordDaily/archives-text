# 'Jumping Frogs' and 'Devil' Operas Presented at Mem Aud this Week
## 
### SHARLENE HOFFMAN 
From Uncle Henry's saloon in 1
Calaveras County, California, to
the palatial home of the wealthy
New Hampshire farmer, Jabez
Stone, goes the action of the two
folk operas "The Jumping Frog
of Calaveras County" and"The
Devil and Daniel Webster." The
two operas will be presented to
morrow, Friday, and Saturday
nights in Memorial Auditorium.
Thee operas, both taking place in
the mid-nineteenth century, are op
posite as far as subject matter and
setting arc concerned.
The rough-and-tumble life of the
mining town, Angel's Camp, in Cala
vrra.s County, provides ihe atmos
phere for "The Jumping Frog of
Calaveras County." The folk opera,
adapted from Mark Twain's .short
story by Lukas Foss, retains and de
velops the caricature element in it.
especially in the scenes in Uncle
Henry's saloon.
On the other hand, "The Devil and
Daniel Webster" is of a melodramatic
nature, showing what happens when
the Devil comes to a New Hampshire
town to claim the soul of one of its
occupants.
Extremes in Roles
There is much double-casting in
the two operas, despite their diverse
nature. The sweet and innocent
bride of Jabez Stone in "The Devil |
and Daniel Webster" is played by |
Yvonne Chaureau, who also takes the
part of Lulu, the kind-hearted and
popular belle of Calaveras County.

For this role, Miss Stone changes
from a demure bridal gown, replete
with orange blossoms, to a crimson
and satin-trimmed strapless costume.
Satan and Smiley
Lawrence Mason plays Satan in
"The Devil and Daniel Webster" and
Smiley, bragging owner of Calaveras
County's celebrated frog. The Devil
appears as a Boston lawyer, wearing

a formal black coat. As Smiley, lie
wears Levis and a striped plaid shirt.
Other persons taking dual roles are
Richard Hale, Carl Palangi, Warner
Imig, Winther Andersen, and Harold
Schmidt, choral director at Stanford.

operas are Don Campbell, Don Rus

sell. and Hugo Mclchionr.
Besides the singers and actors par
ticipating in the production, a 65-
piece orchestra, under the direction
of Sandor Salgo, is mastering the dif
ficult modern idiom of the two op
eras. Adding to the over-all efTect
will be a chorus of singers, some of
