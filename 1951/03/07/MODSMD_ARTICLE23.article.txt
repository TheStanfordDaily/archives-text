# Chinese Reds Launch New Counteroffensive
## Allied Forces Pushed Back 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, March
7 (UP) — Communist forces at
tacked "in strength" in East
Korea early today and drove
back Allied troops in what front
line officers said might be the
start of a massive enemy coun
teroffensive.
The attacks, coming less than 24
hours after Gn. Douglas Mac Arthur
warned of a brewing offensive by
some 100,000 fresh enemy troops
"penetrated" South Korean lines.
Fighting still raged this morning.
• The Communists also gained at the
west end of the line and a series of
four sharp counterattacks forced U.S.
24th Division units off a hill neai
Yangpyong, 25 miles east of Seoul
The Yanks were fighting today to re
capture the height.
In the center of the line parka
clad American troops forged ahead
one to two miles in a blinding
snowstorm as they knifed into the
fringe of a Communist line bris
tling with signs of an imminent
counteroffensive.
Fifteen miles east of Seoul U.S. 3rd
Division troops crossed the Han
River in assault boats and moved
northward against light resistance
in a Red buildup area.
Official combat reports reaching
Bth Army headquarters obviously
were behind front dispatches and a
briefing officer could not confirm the
front reports of large scale enemy
attacks today.
United Press Correspondent Wil
liam Burson reported from the front
that a strong North Korean counter
attack opened six miles northeast of
Amidong during the night. Amidong
is about eight miles north of Pyong
chang.
Field officers conceded today's
attacks might be the start of the
expected counteroflensive. They
said it also might be a "stubborn
attempt" to relieve pressure on the
road junction at Soksa where the
Kangnung-Hoensong lateral road
crosses the road leading northward
from Pangnim.
However, Lt. Gen. Matthew B.
Ridgway, commander of UN ground
forces, also had warned of the possi
bility of a "sharp" counteroffensive
and said such an attack could be con
tained "at the moment."
