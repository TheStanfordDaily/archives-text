at ths Rome Peace Congress April 2-9.
(Meanwhile, across the Bay, the executive committee of stu

to support a Stanford delegate at the congress.
(The Daily is devoting its editorial columns today to an analy

more than a month of debate on the issue,'and the arguments—
pro and con—that have been put forth by various members of
the student body concerning the question.
(If a delegate is chosen tonight, Stanford will be the only uni

Feature Editor, The Daily
The Rome Peace Congress, which opens April 2, will bring to
gether 500 delegates from 37 nations.
These delegates, representing over 300 million people, will act
as individuals at the congress and will not represent nations.
The purpose of the eongress, according to a 10-page pamphlet issued
by promoters of the congress, is to investigate various proposals for
World government which have been made by peoples and organizations
throughout the world.
Four commissions have been working for a year, studying world govern
ment proposals of all kinds. The commissions are: economic and sobial,
constitutional, cultural, and political action.
The committees, made up of the world's political, economic, and social
leaders, have been learning which proposals are commonly agreed on by
different peoples.
These proposals, which are commonly agreed upon by different peoples
in the world, will be presented to the assembly at the Rome Peace Congress.
Major plans which will be proposed concern:
1. World constitution.
2. Methods of representation in a world legislature.
3. Economic and social relief for distressed peoples. These plans gen
erally attempt to work through the United Nation's agencies.
Prominent delegates to the congress are Prime Minister Pandit Nehru of
India; Albert Einstein; Lord Boyd-Orr, Nobel Peace Prize winner for 1949
and chairman of the United Nations World Health Organization.
Robert Hutchins, trustee of the Ford Foundation; V. E. Orlando of Italy;
and Count Sforza, Premier of Italy.
Less than half the delegates come from groups which promote world
government. Most of the delegates represent towns, states, professional
groups, and other non-political groups.
The pamphlet points out that the delegates to the congress do not repre
sent nations or national interests. The delegates will investigate various pro
posals and endeavor to find common areas of agreement, as individuals and
peoples.
After the congress ends April 9, the delegates will return to their coun
tries to promote the program decided upon by the congress.
This plan has a chance to succeed, the congress believes, because of
the prestige of the delegates and because the proposals come from people
who represent their own beliefs and not those of nations.
What Excom Has Done
Gordy Campbell, in a letter to the editor yesterday, pointed out the action
Excom has so far taken on the Rome Congress.
January 31—Excom voted, 8 to 6, not to send an official delegate to the
congress but appointed a committee to look into the possibility of sending
an observer.
Feb. 2—Excom agreed to appropriate a maximum of $100, to defray
lving expenses at the congress for an unofficial observer.
Feb. 21—Rome investigating committee requested that the delegate's title
be changed from observer to delegate so that several gifts might be received,
solicitation might be undertaken, and reduced rates on transportation be
received.
Campbell, in a letter, explained Excom's actions: "Excom turned
down the initial proposal for an ollicial delegate because it was believed
the conference was not of sufficient importance to students at Stanford
for an expenditure of $800 or more.
"However, it did feel the educational value from sending a member of the
student body would be sufficient to merit the awarding of up to $100 as a
help to any worthy candidate.
"Because we are sending an official delegate," Campbell continued, "we
are not necessarily advocating World Federalism or associating the name
of Stanford with it."
Campus Argues—Pro ami Con
Since Excom, late in January, first discussed the possibility of sending a
delegate to the Rome congress, the campus has been a battlefield where stu
dents fought for and against sending the delegate, as well as for and against
the purpose of the congress itself .
Interested students appeared at Excom meetings to expound their ideas
and the"Letters to the Editor" column in the Daily expanded rapidly.
Some of the arguments against the congress are based on erroneous as
sumptions.
Some students claim the congress would be a world federation parley
which would sponsor a representative legislature based on population.
According to this argument, nations like China, Russia, and India would
dominate world government.
One of the plans, the Hutchins plan, culls for a two-house world legisla
ture, the upper house representing nations and the lower house repre
senting populations. However, this is only one of the plans which will be
studied at the congress.
Another argument is that a Stanford student would not have a vote. Ex
corn recently authorized the Stanford delegate to vote, and is awaiting con
firmation from the congress' organizers.
Another conflict concerns what a Stanford student could contribute to
the congress and what the rest of the ASSU would get out of sending
a delegate.
Opponents answer "nothing" to both questions, but those favoring the plan
have more to say.
Harold Fisher, chairman of the Hoover Institute, said a Stanford dele
gate, if well chosen, would make a real contribution.
Ted Buttner, ASSU president, pointed out to Excom at a recent meeting
that the students at Stanford would benefit educationally from sending a
delegate to Rome. Gil Jonas, Excom member, adds that Stanford students
would also benefit morally and in morale.
Phil Saeta, men's halls representative, asserted that few students
would turn out to hear a Stanford student speak about the Koine con
gress.
Lenglhy Comment from Mr. Close
Donald E. Close, interested student, has objected strenuously to Stanford
sending a delegate to a congress which promotes world government.
Close is strongly against world government and has claimed the majority
of Stanford students are opposed to it.
Portions of a letter written by him last week to President Buttner follow:
"The proponents of this proposal (Rome congress) tell us that instead of
being a peace congress, this gathering in Rome is for the purpose of drafting
a world government.
"There is certainly doubt in my mind that collective security as em
bodied in a world government is the way to preserve peace.
"The basic question is whether this committee, Mr. President, can . . .
undertake to commit the reputation of this great institution to public scorn
and disrepute through endorsing the Rome Peace Congress and world gov
ernment."
