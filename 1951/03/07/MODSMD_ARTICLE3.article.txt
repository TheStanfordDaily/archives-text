WASHINGTON â€” Price Stabilizer
Michael V. DiSalle said today new
price ceilings will be issued "very
shortly" for processed foods, and
union officials agreed with Wage
Stabilizer Cyrus S. Ching that there
is some hope for early settlement
of labor's mobilization dispute.
But in Key West, Flu., Defense
Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson again
aroused labor's wrath. He said after
a talk with President Truman that
he had no idea when labor will end
its boycott of the mobilization pro
gram and made clear that neither
he nor Mr. Truman will back down
in the dispute.
