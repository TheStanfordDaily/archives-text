# BRUINS PLACE TWO
## Tucker and Ridgway Are Named As The Season's Outstanding Performers 
### BOB BERNSTEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Eddie Tucker and Dick Ridgway are the outstanding basketball
players in the Southern Division of the PCC, according to the re
sults of the Daily All-Division selections made yesterday.
Stanford's sensational transfer from Compton JC and the UCLA
Bruins' sophomore whiz, who finished second and first respec-

tively in the division scoring race,
paced the voting which saw Cal's Bill
Hagler, Trojan Tom Riach, and
UCLA's Captain Eddie Sheldrake
join them on the mythical first five.
Actually, reference should be made
to the "first six." For Stanford's Jim
Ramstead missed the first team by
such a narrow margin that his name
cannot be ignored in a discussion of
the division's individual stars.
Others named to the second team
were Indian Jim Walsh, Troy's Bob
Boyd and Bob Morton, and Bear Bob
See.
Tucker and Hagler were the only
unanimous choices. However, a
separate poll was taken for the
"outstanding player" award, and
Tucker and Ridgway finished in a
dead heat for that honor. The only
other player in contention for the
nomination was Tom Riach.
The flashy mythical quintet is
manned by three seniors — Hagler.
Riach, and Sheldrake—who have al
ready fcowed out of division compe
tition. Tucker is a junior, Ridgway
the lone sophomore.
Of the second stringers, only See
will be missing from the hardwood
scene in 1952, unless Uncle Sam takes
a further toll. Walsh, Morton, Boyd,
and Ramstead are all juniors.
Thumbnail sketches of the top six:
TUCKER. Th» hoop attributes of
C-ft. 1-in. Eddie were probably best
summed up by Coach Everett Dean
when the latter stated that "Tucker's
40 per cent shooting average from
the floor, his deceptive ball handling,
great speed, passing ability, and fine
competitive spirit rank Eddie as one
of Stanford's outstanding players of
all time."
Tucker's favorite shot is a one
handed push effort from the key
which accounted for most of his 205)
conference points. Always a threat,
he reached his peak in the final
USC game when he looped through
31 points, a new Pavilion mark for
a Stanford player.
RIDGWAY. T a li (6-ft. 4-in.), solid
(198 lbs.), and fast, Richard Lynn
Ridgway is perhaps the top sopho
more eager in the country. Dick cap
tured the scoring crown with 217
points, an average of better than 18
points per outing, despite a relative
relapse in his final four games.
With two full years of collegiate
play ahead of him, Ridgway could
wt II become an all-time UCLA great.
HAGLER. Blond Billy broke al
most every record in the California
form sheet during his four-year stint
at Berkeley. His four-year output of
1274 topped by 93 the previous Andy
Wolfe mark; his one-season confer
ence total of 177 also eclipsed a for
mer record held by Wolfe; he's tied
for fourth highest scorer in division
history; and the Campanile statisti
cians will doubtlessly be turning up
with additional Hagler records until
next basketball season.
Hagler, at G-ft., 3-in„ divided his
duties between center and forward.

He was at his deadliest around the
post, but also a threat with a one
handed set shot from as far as 35
feet.
RIACH. Hustling Tom gloried in !
the fast break, scoring repeatedly on
driving lay-ins. A typical product of
the USC strongman school, Tom is
rugged and rough as well as fast.
Although Riach ran toward the j
bottom of the top 10 scorers during j
most of the season, he finished with
a 10-plus output per game. His best
performances of the year were in the
Pavilion two weeks ago, when his
30-point two-game barage and his
hustling floor game were instru
mental in Troy's gaining a series \
split.
SHELDRAKE. At s—ft. 9-in., Cap
tain Eddie appears a sure repeater on
the Little Ail-American squad for
players under 5-ft. 9-in. He was the
sixth highest scorer in the league, i
hitting the conference high of 38 in a
West wood massacre of Stanford.
Sheldrake is also an outstanding
floor leader and ranks near the top
in dribbling and ball handling. His
accurate overhead shot, almost im- I
possible to block, reduces his
height disadvantage.
RAMSTEAD. Jim, awarded the
"most improved player" title at the
annual Stanford basketball banquet
last night, was the workhorse of the
1951 Indian squad. His 6-ft. 4-in.
height picked off a majority of the
Stanford rebounds, he handled the
key pivot post on offense, and found
time to tank enough goals to rank
him fourth in conference scoring. \
Needless to say, even greater things
are expected of the lanky San Fran
ciscan in his senior year.
