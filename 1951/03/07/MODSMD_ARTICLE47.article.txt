# Medha von Essen to Give Dance Concert Tonight in Women's Gym
## 
### JAN WOHLGEMUTH 
In India, dance embodies the
spirit of drama, through it can
be expressed mood and sug
gestion.
Medha von Essen of Bombay,
India, will convey this expres
sion in a concert of dances of
India tonight at 7:45 in the mod
ern dance studio of the Wom
en's Gym. The concert is open
to the public.
The program is arranged in the
traditional order in which it would
be presented in a temple.
In India, when a girl is to become
a devadasis, or professional dancer,
she lives in the home of the master,
where she becomes as one of the
family. She studies there until the
master decides she is ready. This
usually means several years of in
tensive training. The dancer's "de
but" is made in a temple where the
grace and form of her dance is judged
by all. After this "debut" she is con
sidered a professional dancer.
Four Dance Styles
There are four styles of dance in
India—the Bharat Natyam, the Mani
pur, the Kathakali, and a court dance
of North India. Mrs. von Essen will
show and interpret several of these
styles in her concert. . .. ..
The Bharat Natyam is the expres
sion of worship of the devotees of
Siva in South .India., Through the
dance, the dancer to arouse aes
thetic emotion, or i-asa, in the heart
and mind of the spectator with the
use of moods and rhythm. This is a
very exact form of dance, with a
fixed technique requiring rigorous
training.
Manipuri Dance
In contrast to this exact form of
dance comes the lyrical Manipuri
dance form of Northeast India. The
movements are softer, and allow the
dancer to put her own feeling and
personality into it.
The Kathakali is a pantomimic
dance-drama from South India. This
is usually done by a group depicting
one of the epics of mythological tales.
It, too, requires long and rigorous
training, as the dancer must have
complete control over all the muscles
of the body.
The court-dance of North India is
confined to a few simple gestui'es.
The interest of the dance is in the
fast footwork, speed, and tempo.
Authentic Music
The first five costumes which Mrs.
von Essen will wear are traditional
costumes. The music used in the con
cert tonight is authentic Indian music
which was recorded by her when
she and her husband visited India
last summer.
Mrs. von Essen has studied dance
since she was eight years old. She is
now working toward her Ph.D. in
bacteriology.

DANCES OF INDlA—Medha von Essen will present a dance concert tonight in the modern
dance studio of the Women's Gym.
In India, dance embodies the
spirit of drama, through it can
be expressed mood and sug
gestion.
Medha von Essen of Bombay,
India, will convey this expres
sion in a concert of dances of
India tonight at 7:45 in the mod
ern dance studio of the Wom
en's Gym. The concert is open
to the public.
The program is arranged in the
traditional order in which it would
be presented in a temple.
In India, when a girl is to become
a devadasis, or professional dancer,
she lives in the home of the master,
where she becomes as one of the
family. She studies there until the
master decides she is ready. This
usually means several years of in
tensive training. The dancer's "de
but" is made in a temple where the
grace and form of her dance is judged
by all. After this "debut" she is con
sidered a professional dancer.
Four Dance Styles
There are four styles of dance in
India—the Bharat Natyam, the Mani
pur, the Kathakali, and a court dance
of North India. Mrs. von Essen will
show and interpret several of these
styles in her concert. . .. ..
The Bharat Natyam is the expres
sion of worship of the devotees of
Siva in South .India., Through the
dance, the dancer to arouse aes
thetic emotion, or i-asa, in the heart
and mind of the spectator with the
use of moods and rhythm. This is a
very exact form of dance, with a
fixed technique requiring rigorous
training.
Manipuri Dance
In contrast to this exact form of
dance comes the lyrical Manipuri
dance form of Northeast India. The
movements are softer, and allow the
dancer to put her own feeling and
personality into it.
The Kathakali is a pantomimic
dance-drama from South India. This
is usually done by a group depicting
one of the epics of mythological tales.
