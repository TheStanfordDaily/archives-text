# Redfield States World Union Historical Idea
## 
### 
World government, according to ;
Dr. Robert Redficld. last night's j
Tuesday Evening Series speaker, i
has on its side the irresistible forco
of a historical idea, an idea destined
to influence powerfully man's po- .
litical thought.
'"World government assumes a j
long-run trend in history," the
careful University of Chicago so- [
ciologist contended. This "creative j
idea" is "universal common respon- !
sibility," involving the realization
that all men arc brothers.
Expanding on Alfred North |
Whitehead's theory that ideas move
events, Dr. Rcdfield is convinced the
conccpt of "one world" and the
growing awareness of economic in
terdependence among the citizens
of all countries are undeniable
proofs of the inevitability of world j
government as a movement. ?
Dr. Redfield pointed out that|
world government is not a |
designed by one man as an instru- j
ment for advancing social criticism
or unrealizable philosophical ideals, i
It has been developed by a group of I
"deadly serious, realistic" men.
