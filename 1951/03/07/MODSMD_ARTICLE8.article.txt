Stanford's unwary males will learn the awful power of the press
Friday night when A 1 Capp's comic strip creation of Sadie Hawkins
Day comes to full bloom.
A costume dance is planned by Cardinals that night down the
Bayshore Highway at Austin's Red Barn from 9 to 1. Head mayors

of Stanford's Dogpatch, Wayne Wil
liams and Marian Brummell, have
suggested that dance-goers show up
resemebling such hillbilly charactcrs
as Earthquake McGoon, Big Barn

McSwine, Lonesome Polecat., Hair
less Joe. Mammy or Pappy Yokum,
Daisy Mae or Li'l Abncr, Wolf Gal,
Available Jones, Joe Btfsplk, or any
other of the inhabitants of Capp's
Dogpatch.
Howard Frcderic and his orches
tra, having been assured that they
would not be molested by over
zealous Stanford Daisies and Sadies,
have agreed to appear and make
music throughout the evening.
Tickets will be on sale for 25 cents
at the ASSU office throughout the
week, and will be sold Friday night
at the dance. An additional door
charge will be made of one penny
for every pound of the girl, or if the
girl chooses, for every pound of the
boy.
Guys with bashful gals or non-
Stanford dates arc urged to volun
teer quietly and step up to the ASSU
office and plunk flown their two bits
like men.
Decorations will he in the hillbilly
theme. "I think there's an old-fash
ioned outhouse involved some
where," Dogpatch publicity director
Louise Burrill reported rcccntly.
