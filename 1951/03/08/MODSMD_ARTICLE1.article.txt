### 
TOKYO. Thursday, March 8 (HP)
â€”Allied troops surged forward to
day in a mighty offensive which
gained up to four miles and inflicted
more than 11,000 casualties on the
Communist enemy in its first day.
The heaviest artillery barrage of
the Korean war paralyzed Chinese
defenses at the western end of the
offensive front where the U.S. 25th
Division pushed northward.
Near the eastern end of the line,
an infantry company of the Seventh
U.S. Division, wielding bayonets,
drove North Korean Reds off a stra
tegic hill west of Amidong.
