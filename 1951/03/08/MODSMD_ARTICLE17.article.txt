# Stanford Physicists Reveal New Electron Technique
## Linear Accelerator Exploited To Count Atomic Particles 
### 
Stanford physicists have de
veloped a new electronic tech
nique which permits counting of
atomic particles in a billionth of
a second.
Tlic new technique is designed to
take advantage of an operating
characteristic of the electron linear
accelerator, Stanford's new type
atom smasher, which runs at very
high voltages for very brief periods
of time. It will also be applicable
to other machines, such as betatrons
and some cyclotrons, which acceler
ate particlcs In pulses.
Measuring an atomic particle in a
billionth of a second is comparable
to flashing the whole U.S. budget
in dollar bills past an electronic
counter in a few seconds and at the
same time sincling out and measur
ing a single bill.
The work, financed by the Oflice
of Naval Research and carried out
by Dr. Richard F. Post,, rcsearcli
associate in the Stanford Microwave
Laboratory, assisted by Mr. Norman
S. Shiren and other physicists at the
University, represents a refinement
in the development of scintillation
counters, aristocratic super-sensi
tive cousins of the well-known Gei
ger counter.

Scintillation counters, on which
oxten:ive research has been carried
out at universities all over the
country, take advantage of the fact
that atomic particles produce fiuo
re cent light flashes when they pass
through certain crystals or liquids.
The individual li√üht flashes arc
I called scintillations because of their
resemblance to sparkles or twin
klings.
As is the case with other scintilla
tion counters, Dr. Post uses a pho
tomultiplicr tube to pick up the
minute flashes caused by particles
striking scintillation material. The
tube iv of a type commercially
available, but the infinitesimal time
it is in operation permits the scien
tist to operate- it at 4,000 volts in
stead of the tube's normal load of
1,000 volts.
Stanford physicists said it is im
possible to say where this and other
advantages in counter techniques
may lead, cither scientifically or
practically.
Hundreds of investigators have
been working in laboratories all
i over the country on applications of
! the scintillation counter technique
to nuclear, elementary particle, and
X-ray physics; to cancer research
and diagnosis; and to military and
I industrial survey instruments.
