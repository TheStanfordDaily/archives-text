# ECON LECTURE
## War Ends Recovery 
### 
The current international crisis
has brought an end to recovery; the
principal international economic
problems now are those of defense
and long-term development.
With this analysis, Professor Ed
ward S. Shaw concluded the sev
enth and last of the Department of
Economics winter lecture series
yesterday. In a talk punctuated oc
casionally by the blast of the civil
defense alert whistle, he outlined
recent developments due to the Ko
rean war and the Subsequent drive
for rearmament by the North Atlan
tic Pact countries.
The 1950 inflation in the United
States, caused by private war scare
and stockpile spending, has spread
to other nations and replaced their
dollar shortage with a dollar sur
plus, Shaw said. Ihis American
originated inflation is the first fac
tor in the most recent of the post
war economic crises; the second,
still in prospect, is that of rearma
ment.
The Western nations of the North
Atlantic alliance are planning to
double their military expenditures,
and, since there is no prospect of
increasing the manpower supply or
the productivity of manpower, other
claims on the economy of these
countries must be slighted.
The /actors due for reduction in
clude reconstruction, consumption,
non-military government spending,
anH colonial development. Britain
and several other countries have re
imposed rationing and other emer
gency controls to meet this prob
lem.
