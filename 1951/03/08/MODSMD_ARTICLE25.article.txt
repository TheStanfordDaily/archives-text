To the Editor:
As has been stated in this column before, the so
< ailed Rome Peace Congress is planned for the purpose
of formulating a system of world federal government,
.ind in that respect, the name, "peace congress," is
misleading. I believe peace is included in the name
because the word "peace" blends well with our colâ€”
le; : ,iate enthusiasm and excites sympathy in the Chris
tion conscience. To illustrate this point, both Commu
nist and Fascist organizations employ the word peace
in their names. A good example is the American Con
"rcss for Peace and Democracy, a Communist organ
ization. I join with others, however, in the belief that
world government is not the road to peace.
The arguments against world government are too
numerous and too lengthy to be restated here.
It has been said before that Stanford is a conserva
tive university. I have never subscribed to that state
ment, however, because the people who seem to do all
I he talking as Stanford representatves are the student
radicals who swallow hook, line, and sinker all the
I .el'tist propaganda which they are fed by a small seg
ment <jf an otherwise outstanding faculty. I feel that
il there aie conservatives at Stanford, they are being
much too conservative whtn they remain silent in the
face of such a huge issue as world federation. The
: itULtion demands that every student, particularly
those who have heretofore remained aloof from such
matters, speak out against sending a delegate to Rome.
If the only means of preventing the Executive
( ommittee from pursuing its highly dangerous
course of sending a delegate to the Rome Congress
is to invoke the referendum power granted by the
student body constitution, then students should be
gin at once to circulate petitions calling for an elec
tion to determine whether or not they support or re
ject world federal government.
