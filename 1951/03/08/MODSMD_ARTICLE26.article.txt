# On Examination Changes

To the Editor:
No longer can a professor and student merely agree
I hut there is a real need for giving an early final to
the student and simply working it out themselves.
Instead, both the professor and the student must ap
peal through the Administration. Often when a prob
lem is removed from the only parties directly con
cerned, the result is useless red tape and lack of sym
pathy. This has been my observation in petitioning
for a filial exam change.

I am being married the day after the last day of ,
finals. My professor is eager to move my final (not
the class') up three days, to give me freedom for
the rehearsal, bachelor dinner, family, visiting rela- [
tives. and all the inevitable details of weddings.
He realizes the conflicts: for instance, the only avail- i
able rehearsal time in the church overlaps my final. [
But the Administration says that finals may not be '
changed "for any personal reasons whatsoever."
Since when are urgent personal reasons not as im- I
portant as academic conflicts! A denial of petition
answers the student's sincere question with one word,
"denied." But my question is not answered. Is the
famous honor system doubted? Would the granting
of my request open the way for every "Tom, Dick,
and Harry?" The University is really making it tough '
for me and I challenge their wisdom.

To "Name Withheld":
On the face of your appeal, you have a valid objec
tion. Upon further investigation, however, the Uni
versity's Committee on Examinations has an argu
ment, too.
In the first place, committee members point out,
an event as important as a marriage should be able
to be scheduled far enough in advance to allow for
possible conflicts—especially examination conflicts.
Exceptions to this rule are made only when the con
flicting event is entirely unpredictable and outside
the student's hands to prevent.
Furthermore, the committee asserts, should a special
examination be allowed in the case of one professor,
students will immediately tab him a "good guy" and
expect other professors to do the same—regardless of
their reasons. All of which the committee is unable
to sanction simply because 200 or 300 students taking
special examinations every quarter would be too great
a burden for the faculty as a whole to assume. It Ls for
this very reason that the majority of faculty members
are opposed to special ex's — except when positive
proof is presented to show that the conflict is BEYOND
THE STUDENT'S CONTROL.
Above all, the five-man examination committee
feels that a student's No. 1 obligation when he signs
up for a course is to attend the scheduled examina
tion. While attendance at regular classes is not man
datory, the latter is—and the University wants to
keep it so.
Most piofessors want to be known as "good guys."
It is for this very reason that an impersonal committee
has been set up to judge student petitions in the light
of objective consideration. —The Editor.
