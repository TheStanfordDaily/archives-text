# Indians, Meet Your New Coaches!
## Lynn Boasts Excellent Past Record 
### BOB SPIELMANN 
Just by talking to George
Lynn, a big guy with a friendly
grin, you could never guess that
his record is one of the most out
standing in football today.
He's more than willing to talk
about the gridiron with you, he'll tell
you what a great team Oklahoma had
last year, but when you ask him
about himself he'll reply:
l 'Oh, I wouldn't know what to
say."
Of course, he could tell you that
he won nine letters in high school,
that he played quarterback at Ohio
State for three years, and that he was
backfleld assistant tp Bud Wilkinson
for two years, but he's too modest
for that.
So you couldn't very well expect
hitn to tell you the rest of the story.
Buckeye Captain
In 1942 he was captain of that Ohio
State team he was quarterbacking,
and the Buckeyes not only won the
Big 10 crown, but were generally
considered to be the national cham
pions.
After graduating from Ohio State
with a B.S. degree in 1943, Lynn
went into the Navy, being released
from active duty with the rank of
lieutenant. In 1946 he went back to
his alma mater as an assistant coach.
For the '47 and '48 seasons he
served as an assistant coach at Kent
State University in Ohio. Then in
1949 he moved to Oklahoma Univer
sity.
Oklahoma Backfield
During the next two years, with

Lynn the backfield mentor, the Soon
ers went on a streak that set a new
record of 30 consecutive wins. In
1950 Oklahoma was both the Sugar
Bowl and National champion.
Not till the first of this year did
Lynn ever see an Oklahoma team
lose. That was in the Sugar Bowl as
Kentucky upset the Sooners, 13 to 7.
The job that Lynn did in develop
ing the 1950 backfield, which in
cluded All-American Leon Heath, is
all the more remarkable considering
the fact that Oklahoma lost five Ail-
Americans off the 1949 roster.
Lynn attributes the success of the
Oklahoma team to two factors—the
split-T formation, and the excellent
conditioning of the athletes. The
backfield was noted for its pass de
fense, one of the best in the nation,
Pass defense has long been an
Achilles heel of Stanford teams.
House Hunting
Married in 1944 to the former Doris
Weiser, Lynn now has two children,
and a problem. No place to live in
or around Palo Alto. He's looking for
a house.
There you have the story. George
Lynn played under Paul Brown and
worked with Bud Wilkinson, and
both coaches have been named
"coach-of-the-year." He played for
Ohio State and the Buckeyes won the
national championship. He went to
Oklahoma and the Sooners won the
national championship. Could be it's
more than a coincidence!

his alma mater as an assistant coach.
For the '47 and '48 seasons he
served as an assistant coach at Kent
State University in Ohio. Then in
1949 he moved to Oklahoma Univer
sity.
Oklahoma Backfield
During the next two years, with

Lynn the backfield mentor, the Soon
ers went on a streak that set a new
record of 30 consecutive wins. In
1950 Oklahoma was both the Sugar
Bowl and National champion.
Not till the first of this year did
Lynn ever see an Oklahoma team
lose. That was in the Sugar Bowl as
Kentucky upset the Sooners, 13 to 7.
The job that Lynn did in develop
ing the 1950 backfield, which in
cluded All-American Leon Heath, is
all the more remarkable considering
the fact that Oklahoma lost five Ail-
Americans off the 1949 roster.
Lynn attributes the success of the
Oklahoma team to two factors—the
split-T formation, and the excellent
conditioning of the athletes. The
backfield was noted for its pass de
fense, one of the best in the nation,
Pass defense has long been an
Achilles heel of Stanford teams.
House Hunting
Married in 1944 to the former Doris
Weiser, Lynn now has two children,
and a problem. No place to live in
or around Palo Alto. He's looking for
a house.
There you have the story. George
Lynn played under Paul Brown and
worked with Bud Wilkinson, and
both coaches have been named
"coach-of-the-year." He played for
Ohio State and the Buckeyes won the
national championship. He went to
Oklahoma and the Sooners won the
national championship. Could be it's
more than a coincidence!


GEORGE LYNN
—Ex-Ohio State great
Just by talking to George
Lynn, a big guy with a friendly
grin, you could never guess that
his record is one of the most out
standing in football today.
He's more than willing to talk
about the gridiron with you, he'll tell
you what a great team Oklahoma had
last year, but when you ask him
about himself he'll reply:
l 'Oh, I wouldn't know what to
say."
Of course, he could tell you that
he won nine letters in high school,
that he played quarterback at Ohio
State for three years, and that he was
backfleld assistant tp Bud Wilkinson
for two years, but he's too modest
for that.
So you couldn't very well expect
hitn to tell you the rest of the story.
Buckeye Captain
In 1942 he was captain of that Ohio
State team he was quarterbacking,
and the Buckeyes not only won the
Big 10 crown, but were generally
considered to be the national cham
pions.
After graduating from Ohio State
with a B.S. degree in 1943, Lynn
went into the Navy, being released
from active duty with the rank of
lieutenant. In 1946 he went back to
his alma mater as an assistant coach.
For the '47 and '48 seasons he
served as an assistant coach at Kent
State University in Ohio. Then in
1949 he moved to Oklahoma Univer
