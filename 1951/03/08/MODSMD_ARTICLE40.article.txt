# Card Mermen Face Broncos
## 
### 
i After a week of come - through
performances by all hands, the
Stanford swimming team will meet
Santa Clara's squad this afternoon
at 4 in the Bronco pool.
During the past seven days, the
varsity beat Fullerton JC 57 to 18,
the freshmen won over Stockton JC
48 to 26, and Tom Haynie's stop
watch has recorded some of the best
times ever done by Card swimmers.
Perhaps the most 'outstanding
times were turned in by Pete Cole,
all junior distance freestyler, who
won the 220 Friday against Fuller
ton in 2:12.7, which is two full sec
onds better than he had ever done
before.
