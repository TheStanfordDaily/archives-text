# Line Coach, Joe Ruetz, Gets Impression of Farm
## 
### JIM MADISON 
He is as yet doing little but "getting acquainted, feeling his way
around, and asking a lot of questions," but Joe Ruetz, Stanford's
new line coach is already very impressed with the Farm and the
"Stanford Family"; and take my word for it, he is a man with
whom Stanford will be mighty impressed in return.

Last season's head coach at St. j
Mary's, he holds a doctorate degree
in Anthropology, but he looks like a
football coach — tall, well-propor
tioned, with a calm, friendly smile
and voice.
And he feels and thinks like a foot
ball coach. "My greatest thrill in
coaching was to have St. Mary's tie
Georgia in 1950, 20 to 20. A grou£ of
undermanned kids put together their
best effort with their share of the
breaks to give me that 'once in a
lifetime' kind of game."
College: Notre Dame
Coach Joe played three years of
college ball at Notre Dame in 1936-
38. He was a guard as a sophomore
and a senior, but in 1937 was a block
ing QB in the famous Notre Dame
box. "It wasn't so different from
running guard and — well — Layden
just needed quarterbacks."
He was an assistant coach at St.
Mary's from 1938 to 1941. It was on
Dec. 6, 1941, that he left on a camp
ing trip from Bladding, Utah, and
did not find out that there was a war
on until 42 days later, when he had
hiked 150 miles back to civilization
through three feet of snow.
In 1942, commissioned an ensign,
USNR, he played on the St. Mary's
Pre-Flight ball team, and met Chuck
Taylor while the Pre-Flighters were
taking a lacing from the 1942 Cards.
In the spring of 1943. Ruetz re
signed his first commission and en
listed as an aviation cadet. In June,
1944, he was commissioned again, as
a second lieutenant, USMCR. He
served overseas as a carrier fighter
pilot, then went on inactive duty in
April, 1946.
Pro Ball, 1946-48
In 1948 the likeable new coach re
turned to St. Mary's as line coach
from the Chicago Rockets where he
had played since '46. "I was too old
at 31, and at only 185 pounds, was
taking a terrific beating in pro line
play."
St. Mary's promoted Ruetz to head
coach in 1950, then abandoned foot
ball at the end of last season. So he
was free to take the line coaching
job when offered it by Chuck Taylor.
Of the ballplayers at St. Mary's
Ruetz says that those whom he feels
could have made the grade at Stan
ford, both athletically and scholastic
ally, were already ticketed for other
schools when he got the job here.
And that's Joe Ruetz, until about
March 15 when he and the rest of the
coaching start start work in earnest
on the organization and plans for the
1951 Big Red Machine and on the
outline for spring practice.

a second lieutenant, USMCR. He
served overseas as a carrier fighter
pilot, then went on inactive duty in
April, 1946.
Pro Ball, 1946-48
In 1948 the likeable new coach re
turned to St. Mary's as line coach
from the Chicago Rockets where he
had played since '46. "I was too old
at 31, and at only 185 pounds, was
taking a terrific beating in pro line
play."
St. Mary's promoted Ruetz to head
coach in 1950, then abandoned foot
ball at the end of last season. So he
was free to take the line coaching
job when offered it by Chuck Taylor.
Of the ballplayers at St. Mary's
Ruetz says that those whom he feels
could have made the grade at Stan
ford, both athletically and scholastic
ally, were already ticketed for other
schools when he got the job here.
And that's Joe Ruetz, until about
March 15 when he and the rest of the
coaching start start work in earnest
on the organization and plans for the
1951 Big Red Machine and on the
outline for spring practice.
He is as yet doing little but "getting acquainted, feeling his way
around, and asking a lot of questions," but Joe Ruetz, Stanford's
new line coach is already very impressed with the Farm and the
"Stanford Family"; and take my word for it, he is a man with
whom Stanford will be mighty impressed in return.

Last season's head coach at St. j
Mary's, he holds a doctorate degree
in Anthropology, but he looks like a
football coach — tall, well-propor
tioned, with a calm, friendly smile
and voice.
And he feels and thinks like a foot
ball coach. "My greatest thrill in
coaching was to have St. Mary's tie
Georgia in 1950, 20 to 20. A grou£ of
undermanned kids put together their
best effort with their share of the
breaks to give me that 'once in a
lifetime' kind of game."
College: Notre Dame
Coach Joe played three years of
college ball at Notre Dame in 1936-
38. He was a guard as a sophomore
and a senior, but in 1937 was a block
ing QB in the famous Notre Dame
box. "It wasn't so different from
running guard and — well — Layden
just needed quarterbacks."
He was an assistant coach at St.
Mary's from 1938 to 1941. It was on
Dec. 6, 1941, that he left on a camp
ing trip from Bladding, Utah, and
did not find out that there was a war
on until 42 days later, when he had
hiked 150 miles back to civilization
through three feet of snow.
In 1942, commissioned an ensign,
USNR, he played on the St. Mary's
Pre-Flight ball team, and met Chuck
Taylor while the Pre-Flighters were
taking a lacing from the 1942 Cards.
In the spring of 1943. Ruetz re
signed his first commission and en
listed as an aviation cadet. In June,
1944, he was commissioned again, as
a second lieutenant, USMCR. He
served overseas as a carrier fighter
pilot, then went on inactive duty in
April, 1946.
