# Mock Raid Is Ignored
## 
### RALPH HANDY 
Stanford's first air raid drill since
the early days of World War II left
the campus with a variety of reac
tions ranging from ''lousy" to "fair
ly successful."
A statement issued by the Farm's
Civil Defense "Big Four." Alf Bran
din, Philip Duffy, Donald Gray, and
Thomas Spragens, expressed their
appreciation "to all personnel of the
Civil Defense organization for their
co-operation in making this first
trial run as successful as it was."
They promised that deficiencies
pointed up in yesterday's mock raid
would be worked on and corrected
at staff meetings of the Civil De
fense Center.
Meanwhile, students seemed to
agree that although the actual Civil
Defense machinery worked relative
ly well, not enough student interest
had been generated with the result
that most individuals took the
whole thing as a "big joke."
Lack of publicity and a lack of
firm instructor leadership were
named as major contributing fac
tors to the mild student reaction.
Reaction to the warning blasts ran
all the way from "deafening" from
students in the Art Department, and
Hoble to "slept right through it"
from afternoon nappcrs in the Bran
ner-Stern-Toyon area.
Murray Swedenborg, Stern junior,
complained, "Nobody did anything.
There wasn't enough interest cre
ated beforehand and naturally when
it came off, everyone was disinter
ested."
Carol Folsom, Roble, thought that
the drill could have been better or
ganized and better publicized. 'I
didn't think it was particularly suc
cessful," she said. "People were
wandering around all the time and
traffic didn't stop at all."
KA Charles Jarvis suggested that
people should have taken the drill
more seriously. "Cars were driving
around and people seemed disinter
ested, but in spite of the lack of
student interest the Civil Defense
people seemed to be doing a good
job," he said.
Margaret Pottenger, Roth, thought
there was "an awful lot of noise."
An art major, she was in class in
the Art Department when the alarm

sounded. "The siren almost deaf
ened us," she said. Class continued
as usual, she reported.
"I think specific directions should
have gone to the instructors," she
declared. "The teachers didn't seem

to know any more about, it than we j
did and they could have stimulated
the proper individual reaction."
Gordon Nordby, Stern junior,
pointed out the need for a "bigger
noise" to sound the alert.



SOME OF THE ROVING KINDâ€”The girls on the left were too anxious to see what was hap
pening to remain in their corridors when they learned that Branner had been the victim of the at
tack. When they saw a photographer snap their picture, they realized their mistake and fled into
their corridor. The girls on the right were folio wing orders; however, they didn't know that they
were standing in the corridor that was supposed to have been hit.


WHA' HOPPIN' The firemen climb up to the second floor of
Branner to peep around and see what damage was done. They
didn't find a fire, but they found a lot of girls sitting in the cor
ridors talking.
