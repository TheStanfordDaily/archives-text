# Bok Named Delegate To Rome Conference
## Excom Goes Into Closed Session; Approves Senior Encina Sponsor 
### 
Senior Derek Bok, Encina head sponsor, was chosen late last
night as Stanford's official delegate to the Rome Peace Congress
April 2 to 9.
Bok was chosen unanimously by Excom members in open ses
sion after a 30-minute closed meeting with Tom Bartlett and Gordon

Addison, representatives of the six
man committee named to screen can
didates for the Rome delegate posi
tion.
Bok was recommended highly by
♦he screening committee and de
scribed by Bartlett as a "very cap
able" person to represent ASSU. His
recommendation came from a list of
20 interviev/ecs, all of whom were
rated "of high caliber."
His selection came after a last
ditch stand against the proposal by
Donald PL Close, who labeled Ex
enm's derision "the most important
in more than (50 years of University
existence."
Close said he doubted whether 20
per cent of the student body would
vote for world government or for
the peace congress.
Close said that "no substantial
Americans are going to the con
gress," and asserted that both Al
bert Einstein and Robert Hutch
ins, two of the delegates from
this country, have "un-American"
leanings.
Rome Delegate Bok is a political
science major, has been in Europe
and South America at various times
during the past three years, and
plans to go into international rela
tions as a graduate next year. He is
a member of Phi Kappa Sigma fra
ternity.
Excom has collected approxi
mately $.'J6O in outside donations to
finance the $700 trip to and from
Rome. This amount; coupled with a
maximum donation of $100 from
ASSU, still leaves $240 to go.
Official voting capacity of the
ASSU delegate is still a moot
question. However, Oil Jonas,
off-campus representative, said he
is now awaiting a reply from Paris
on this point, and indicated it
would be merely a matter of for
mality.
Word has not yet been received
from the University of California
student body executive group,
which was reported to have consid
ered sponsorship of the Stanford
delegate — including financial sup
port—last night.
Excom gave the go-ahead to the
establishment of a special Co-recre
ational Committee to operate under
the ASSU. A constittuion for the
group was approved.
According to ASSU Vice - Presi
dent Jo Lyons, the new committee is
designed to co-ordinate the activi
ties of many campus clubs, such as
Ski Club, Village Folk Dance, and
others.
Clubs may join the committee
or not, according to their wish.
The appointment of Stan Shein
baum as head of the student police
force was approved. Shcinbaum, a
graduate student, will handle the
job during spring quarter at a sal
ary of $90 per quarter.
Excom okayed the Public Rela
tions staff picked by Co-ordinator
Gordon Addison. (See page 2 for

during the past three years, and
plans to go into international rela
tions as a graduate next year. He is
a member of Phi Kappa Sigma fra
ternity.
Excom has collected approxi
mately $.'J6O in outside donations to
finance the $700 trip to and from
Rome. This amount; coupled with a
maximum donation of $100 from
ASSU, still leaves $240 to go.
Official voting capacity of the
ASSU delegate is still a moot
question. However, Oil Jonas,
off-campus representative, said he
is now awaiting a reply from Paris
on this point, and indicated it
would be merely a matter of for
mality.
Word has not yet been received
from the University of California
student body executive group,
which was reported to have consid
ered sponsorship of the Stanford
delegate — including financial sup
port—last night.
Excom gave the go-ahead to the
establishment of a special Co-recre
ational Committee to operate under
the ASSU. A constittuion for the
group was approved.
According to ASSU Vice - Presi
dent Jo Lyons, the new committee is
designed to co-ordinate the activi
ties of many campus clubs, such as
Ski Club, Village Folk Dance, and
others.
Clubs may join the committee
or not, according to their wish.
The appointment of Stan Shein
baum as head of the student police
force was approved. Shcinbaum, a
graduate student, will handle the
job during spring quarter at a sal
ary of $90 per quarter.
Excom okayed the Public Rela
tions staff picked by Co-ordinator
Gordon Addison. (See page 2 for
list of staff members.)


DEREK BOK
—Bound for Rome
Senior Derek Bok, Encina head sponsor, was chosen late last
night as Stanford's official delegate to the Rome Peace Congress
April 2 to 9.
Bok was chosen unanimously by Excom members in open ses
sion after a 30-minute closed meeting with Tom Bartlett and Gordon

Addison, representatives of the six
man committee named to screen can
didates for the Rome delegate posi
tion.
Bok was recommended highly by
♦he screening committee and de
scribed by Bartlett as a "very cap
able" person to represent ASSU. His
recommendation came from a list of
20 interviev/ecs, all of whom were
rated "of high caliber."
His selection came after a last
ditch stand against the proposal by
Donald PL Close, who labeled Ex
enm's derision "the most important
in more than (50 years of University
existence."
Close said he doubted whether 20
per cent of the student body would
vote for world government or for
the peace congress.
Close said that "no substantial
Americans are going to the con
gress," and asserted that both Al
bert Einstein and Robert Hutch
ins, two of the delegates from
this country, have "un-American"
leanings.
Rome Delegate Bok is a political
science major, has been in Europe
and South America at various times
during the past three years, and
plans to go into international rela
tions as a graduate next year. He is
a member of Phi Kappa Sigma fra
ternity.
