# Farm Holds Civil Defense Alert; Branner Attacked
## Alert Pleases Brandin 
### 
"A bomb has hit the south
wing of Branner, inujring 30
girls. Communications have
been knocked out, a fire is rag
ing, and a water main on Escon
dido road has burst."
So read a note from a sealed en
velope opened by Branner Hall Di
rector Mrs. Inslee Flickenger at 4:10
yesterday afternoon.
Twenty minutes later the surprise
civil defense trial alert was over.
But for most students, for one
reason or another (.see story on
page 4) the alert had never hegun.
A yellow alert was signaled by
the Firehouse whistle at 4 p.m., and
Stanford's seven division civil de
fense program swung into action.
Division heads reported to the
command center, the Firehouse, and
district wardens to their respective
areas.
Alf Brandin, campus civil defense
chief, reported 80 per cent of Stan
ford's 28 district wardens responded,
explaining absences by the surprise
nature of the alert, which caught
some wardens off campus.
Three of the Fire Department's
four trucks were dispatched to dif
ferent campus spots on the yellow
alert—one at Mirada and Gerona,
another at the elementary school
on Mayficld avenue, and a third at
Ai»guello and Escondido streets.

The last truck remained at the j
Firehouse unit! further orders.
Ten minutes after the yellow, the
red alert sounded. Sealed envelopes
were opened by Mrs. Flickenger; by !
Miss Pat Davidson, Stern Hall di
rector, telling of a broken water main i
on Escondido near Stern; and hy '
firemen on the truck at Escondido
and Arguello telling of Branncr's
"fire."
The "bomb" had dropped.
The information was radioed to

the command renter; then relayed
to appropriate civil defense depart
ments, where men and equipment
were dispatched to Branner, the
mock attack site.
The Fire Department sent two
trucks in addition to the one .sta
tioned nearby; the Health Service
dispatched a doctor and nurse; pub
lic works crews from the Corporation
Yard went to the emergency scene
and to the site of the "burst" water
pipe.

All had arrived at their destina
( tions by 4:25, 10 minutes after the
red alert had sounded.
NROTC students, who were to
act as auxiliary police, began mus
tering on the yellow alert, hut ar
rived at Branner close to 4:;$0, after
the Fire Department had reported
the fire under control.
Brandin said military reserve
participation in the CD program is
a problem, but "for the most part,
division response was very good."

He said the Firehouse warr'ng
whistle will probably have to be
replaced. Most students at Bn>n
ner, Encina, and other c ormito ;■
at a distance from the Fireho
were unable to hear the warn n
Student response at Branner wa
confused. "Casualties" were re
moved from the south wing, the
lobby cleared, and women in the
safe wings directed to stani lac:n
corridor walls.
Tide-fighting equipment was run
up the south wing and the 'f.re"
estimated under control at 4:22.
Miss Anastasia Doyle and Miss
Christine Kicker, housing and
feeding division heads respective
ly, received details of the mock
attack from the -command center
on the red alert, and made provi
sions to transfer Branner evac
uees to Roble.
Commenting on procedure, Bran
din called it "reasonably successful
for a first alert."
He pointed out two major flaws
in the operation, which will be dis
cussed at a meeting of department
heads next week.
Biggest problem is the warning
system, which he said can be aug
mented by the steam plant whistle
or replaced with sirens used during
World War 11.
He named fraflic, which dimin
ished only slightly during the
alert, as the second maior prob
lem, explaining that police were
directed not to stop traffic for the
test, and many drivers were un
able to hear the signals.
Philip Duffy, University purchas
ing agent and number two in the
campus Civil Defense program, an
alyzed student reaction saying, "The
whole thing seems too far away
for most students to take much di
rect interest."
