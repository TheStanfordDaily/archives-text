# Mason's 'Magnetism’ Sparks Folk Operas
## 
### 
A first-night audience, appreciative as usual, loudly applauded
the Stanford Players' and Department of Music's production of
"Two American Operas" last night. If there isn't actually guite
that much to appreciate, there is at least enough to make a ticket
worth the price.
Lawrence Mason sees to that. It is his performances in both

"The Jumping Frog of Calaveras
County" and 'The Devil and Dan
iel Webster" (hut especially in the
former) that spark the evening.
lie can net, he has a pleasant
voice- hut above all, he has the
magnetism that one finds only in
the best of performers.
One may question his interpreta
tion of the devil (it somehow has
more the gentle tone ol A 1 Jol.son's
father about it ir, n that of Satan),
but as Smiley in "Jumping Frog" he
is unqualifiedly excellent.
Richard Hale, who was imported

from Broadway to do the roles of the
Stranger and of Daniel Webster, is,
unfortunately, exactly what one
might expect a university to import.
For a professional, his voice is grav
elly, and his outrageously overdone
acting in 'Jumping Frog" reminds
one of a marionette.
Yvonne Chauveau is adequate in
both of her roles, though Carl Pa
langi as Jahcz in "Daniel Webster"
is wooden.
Though this is opera, there is no
law forbidding tunes that can be
hummed or whistled. Though tho
music is interesting, and unusually
well executed by the orchestra,
there is not. a single memorable
melody in either opera.
Del ford Brummer's eerie lighting
effects in "Daniel Webster" are par
ticularly outstanding, and the cho
rus sings with gusto.
Special mention should go to
Wendell Cole for his magnificent
settings, and to Virginia Opsvig for
her colorful costumes.—Dick Frc

Stone from the clutches of Mr. Scratch, the Devil himself, in the
