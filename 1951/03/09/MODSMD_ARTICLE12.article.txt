## Tresidder Memorial Will Include Ballroom and Recreation Facilities 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Some clay Stanford students
may dance in the outdoor patio
of a large new ballroom.
Some day the Farm's clubs
and committees may meet in
their own building.
Some day the present Union
Residence may house visiting
dignitaries.
The Student Union Planning Com
mittee hopes so. Working with the
faculty members and officials who
make up the University Plant De
velopment Committee, the student
group helps form the plans which
will someday make a new central
ized Union possible.
Milton Johnson, graduate student
in architecture; Elise McKown, a
jimiot maioring in sociology; and
.Joyce Graybiel, an education senior,
form the committee. They serve in
an advisory capacity, giving the stu
dent viewpoint to the following
school planners:
A If l»randin, University business
manager; Thomas Spracens. assist
ant t'» the President: Kldridge T.
Spencer, director of planning;
George Knoles, associate professor
cf history; Ray Faulkner, professor
of art; James Wells, professor of
civil engineering; Frederick Ter
num. (lean of the School of Engi
neering; and Philip l.cighton, pro
fessor of chemistry.
The wni k these planners have been
doing moved ahead another step last
week, when it was announced that
the Board of Trustees had approved
the area where Maison Franchise is
now located as the site of the Tresid
der Memorial.
Top priority project among new
Union facilities, the Tresidder Me
morial will probably include a ball
room, banquet space, and a recrea
tion an a for bowling, billiards, and
pine-pong.
When will all this he built? The
planners wish I hey knew. Money
is the hit; barrier. For the Univer

until there hit enough funds to pay
for the entire project.
At present tlir Trosidder Memorial
fund eon tains approximately $.'545,-
000 The building is expected to cost
$500,000.
Continually rising costs and mate
rials .shortages caused fcy the Korean
War complicate matters even further.
In fact, the committee considers con
ditions so indefinite that it will not
eve n set an approximate date for be
ginning construction.
It'.it funds for the memorial con

(I) I nion profits; (2) SI per stu

denl from each quarter's tuition;
(I!) private donations.
When the Tresidder unit is paid
for, thee sources Will be channeled
into a fund for the other Union fa
cilities.
In the University's over-all plan
ning tor the future, the new Union
will lit in with a peripheral road
project, closing ofT part of Santa
Teresa street and doing away with
the traffic-jamming Post Office inter
section. The project will also call
for the razing of Russell House and
the construction of a parking area in
back of the Lower Row houses.
But all plans are very tentative.

time it takes to collect money make
it difficult to plan ahead, they pointei

Plans for faculty facilities are
