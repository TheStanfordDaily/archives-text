'il ha 9* no official connection with Stanford Univer
sity, but I should appreciate an opportunity to com
« 15• 111 on a statement made by the Men's Counselor,
IVB\ Richard Balch, which has come to my attention.
Sfu the Stanford Daily (March (i) Mr. Balch was
ijuoted ifls complimenting Stanford men for not
yielding to mass hysteria and leaving school to join
t|»e service, as many other students have done.
CA fine level-headed young man of my acquaintance
recently left the University of California to enlist in
tfye Marine Corps because of a sincere and abiding
< as he stated to me, that he could never be
at 1 ease with himself while other boys of his own aye
were fighting his fight. I am sure that many others
have enlisted as well because they feel as he does and
tljat hysteria played no part in their decision.
Il is a matter of individual conscience for a young
mart to decide whether completion of his college
training will better fit him for doing his part. It is
certainly, however, an injustice to malign the cour
age of a considerable number whose sense of obli
gation to their country and to others of their gen
eration has taken the form of joining lite armed
Sjervice.
