# Rome Congress-Solution?

T}< the Editor:
.'Made up essentially of idealists, Ihe Rome Congress
will not be able to take any measures that will bring
World Federation into being. Only in the way the
(ingress can influence the world's .statesmen and
world public opinion will it contribute any measure
of success.
J History is lull of examples of just such conferences
which started the motion toward a new trend in world
ofder. Our own country was founded on the princi
ples arrived at in a series of conferences and conven
tions starting with the First Continental Congress in
1774. Granted this does not mean that the Rome Con
gress will find a solution to some of the world's prob
lems, but if our knowledge of the past means anything,
this conference has great possibilities.
present world crisis seems to be the result of
the political order now in existence in the world.
National states evidently can't overthrow their na
tional distrust of each other and the result is a feel
ing of insecurity which gives rise to aggression.
The United Nations is too weak to maintain perma
nent order, as its members think in terms of their na
t ional interests before those of the world at large.
A continuation of the present order of governments
offers little hope for the preservation of peace.
The one conceivable solution seems to be the evo
lution of a strong federal government of the world.
At one time this was impractical and unrealistic,
hut as modern advances have come about, the world
has shrunk in size to the point where world govern-,
inent is not only desirable but realistic.
The Rome Congress will try to find a means of
bringing about a world federal government, and
therefore offers hope to us all.
I cannot see how Mr. Close can say the majority of
Stanford students are against the Rome Congress. One
would be closer to the truth to say the majority are
unaware of the Congress.
