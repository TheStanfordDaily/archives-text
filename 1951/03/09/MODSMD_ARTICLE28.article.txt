# Against Mr. Close's Petition
## 
### 
To the Editor:
• • . Petitioning against a delegate to Rome will
show that we're against World Federation, all right,
il thats what the object is. And it will show that we're
not only conservative and near-sighted, but blind.
Most ol all, it will keep our delegate from putting in
hi.s two cents' worth for what we do want. Donald E.
Close should realize that only if we are represented
can we have any way of fighting against the "evils
ol World Federation" and ol coming to a compromise.
