To the Editor:
Prof. Gordon Ferris, advocating the Atlantic Union
stand at the ASSU-sponsored forum Monday night,
admitted that his knowledge of history is limited; he
then went on to criticize Prof. Arnold Toynbee, ad
mittedly a scholar of history, on the grounds that : (1)
he drew upon past events for his analysis of contem
porary trends toward world political unification, and
(2) that he "misinterpreted" these events when he
predicted that a world government is inevitable.
Ferris then proceeded to an extremely oversim
plified and shockingly uncivilized series of analogies
from the past in which he attempted to justify the
cave-man theory that might makes right; i.e., when
someone comes up with an idea that does not agree
with ours, we must "club him down and beat his
brains in" until he sees the light. (He admitted this
policy probably would lead to a totalitarian gov
ernment.)
We might, like the reserved Britisher, term this at
titude "most unscientific" or, like this Britisher's wife,
call it "quite shocking."
We would prefer, instead, to reply to our honorable
scientist's charge that the concept of world federalism
is idealistic by quoting from Gen. Eisenhower's ad
dress of March 23, 1950. Eisenhower said;
"The two requisites to an enduring peace—the
elimination of the deep-seated incitements to strife
and hopelessness, and the elimination of armament
for aggression—are, or should be, within the realm
of feasible attainment Nevertheless, those who
term these twin requisites Utopian and visionary
are cut from the same bolt of cloth as those of an
earlier day who claimed that epidemics were an in
escapable companion to human existence and de
nounced the preachers of sanitation as balkers of
God's will."
Mr. Ferris will undoubtedly label Eisenhower and
any other individual who disagrees with AUC's "hard
realism" an idealist. We are forced, however, to clas
sify Mr. Ferris with those who denounced his scien
tific predecessors—"the preachers of sanitation"—as
"balkers of God's will."
