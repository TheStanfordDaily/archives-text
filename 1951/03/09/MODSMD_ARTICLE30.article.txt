# Campus and Good Friday
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Stanford has always been proud of its chapel and
ol the lact that it is located in the heart of the campus
—for it is supposed to be "the hub of Stanford life in
actuality and in spirit."
How is this principle reconciled to the fact that on
the afternoon of Good Friday, perhaps the most
meaningful of Christian history, students are ex
pected to forego religious devotions in order to take
their final examinations?
To lessen the problem this year, we urge on your
part, a plea to professors to permit students whose
tests conflict with their religious intentions to take
their tests at some other pre-arranged hour. We also
ask that steps be taken to avoid this situation in the
future: either a blanket excusal from exams or classes
of those students who wish to attend religious serv
ices, or, preferably, a formal University observance of
the three hours by lack of any scheduled classes or
exams during that time.

(Students wishing to observe Good Friday may
visit Memorial Church anytime between 12 and 3
p.m. for a service of prayers, devotion, and organ
and choral music. Chaplain Minto has purposely
planned the service to allow students to come in at
any time for any length of time.
(In addition, as far as the University itself is con
cerned, the Church will hold its regular noon prayer
services throughout the week plus a communion
service Thursday night, on the eve of Good Friday.
(Unfortunately, Good Friday is not recognized as
a legal holiday. In addition, "there are just so manv
days in one quarter,' making it nearly impossible
for the University to call off all non-religious activ
ity that afternoon.
(It is our feeling that any student wishing to ob
serve Good Friday may find time to do so without
jeopardizing either his studies or the sanctity of the
day. —The Editor)
