# Jiles, Van Sant Lead Broad, High Jumpers

### KEITH MULROONEY 
Despite the loss of iron man Gay Bryan, Track Coach Jack
Weiershauser will field a strong crop of broad jumpers and high
jumpers this season.
Weiershauser has come up with some excellent substituting
for Bryan in both events.
In the high jump Weiershauser will replace Gay, who cleared

G ft. 5 in., with sophomore standout
Norm Jiles who leaped G ft. 4% in.
as a freshman. Norm was consistent
at G ft. 3 in. last year.
Jiles One of the Coast's Best
The coach believes Jiles has ter
rific potential and predicts he will
be one of the top jumpers in the
PCC this season.
Backing up Jiles are juniors
Clyde Taylor and Ron Allen, each
with marks of G ft. 1 in. Last season
Taylor nabbed second place in both
the California and UCLA meets.
SC has one of the best jumpers in
the nation in Manuel Ronquillo who
topped G ft. 6'/j in. as a freshman

last year. To aid Ronquillo are: Jack
Barnes, G ft. 6M» in.; Dick Brombach,
6 ft. 5 in.; and Jim Kincheloe, G ft.
4% in.
Van Sant Seventh in Nation
In the broad jump the Cards have
good jumpers but they lack depth.
Senior Merritt Van Sant, with a
mark of 24 ft. IV4 in., is one of the
top jumpers on the coast. Van Sant
probably won't equal Bryan's rec
ord of hopping over 25 ft. six times,
but he was good enough to place
seventh in last year's NCAA cham
pionships.
Hopping with Van Sant are soph
omore Pete McKay at 22 ft. 1 in. and
Jeff Macßae, a junior transfer with
no listed mark.
UCLA has just acquired for
mer high school sensation George
Brown, who jumped 25 ft. 2 in as a
prep. SC has Ron Sorgen at 24 ft.
4'/> in. National broad jump cham-

pion Jerome Biffle is back for an
other year of competition at Denver.
Mathias Won't Jump
As in the case of almost all
events, Weiershauser could greatly
strengthen the high jump and broad
jump by entering all-around com
petitor Bob Mathias, who has long
hopped 23 ft. J /4 in. and high jumped
6 ft. 2% in. But the head mentor is
still sticking with his plan to have
Bob concentrate on the disc?us, shot
put, and high hurdles.
