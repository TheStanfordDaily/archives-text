# Hayniemen Coast to 51-24 Win Over Bronc Swimmers
## 
### 
Tom Haynie's swimmers won
their fourth straight dual meet yes
terday, beating a feeble Santa Clara
squad 51 to 24 in the Santa Clara
pool.
Haynie gave his top swimmers a
rest, in order to give the rest of the
team a chance to win a few races.
This and the Bronco pool, an odd
length indoor tank, kept the times
from being sensational.
Big man for the Indians was
Ash Jones, who won the 220 and
440 freestyle races. Jones, who
usually swims breaststroke, did
2:27 and 5:34 for the two events.
George Mowat, I)ayr Peterman,
A1 Marsh, and Bob Grisemer were
the other individual winners for
Stanford. Mowat won the 100
freestyle by four yards in 58.4,
Peterman took the breaststroke
by half a pool length, and Marsh
and Grisemer swam to a dead heat
in the 50 free in 25.0.
Upset of the day was the diving,
where high-flying Bill Glathe came
a cropper. Glathe, one of the best
on the coast on the three - meter
board, dove on a one-meter board
which had little or no spring, and
wound up third. Santa Clara's A1
Cooper won with 226 points, while
Johnny Miller edged into second
with 217. Glathe, who scored 330 on
the high board last week, dropped
down to 204.
Santa Clara's only other winner
was Ajax Hansen in the backstroke.
