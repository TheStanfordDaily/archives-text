# PROGRAM OKAYED
## IFC Votes Scholarship Proposition 
### 
The proposal for refinancing
ASSU foreign scholars among
fraetrnities v/as voted down by
the IFC at last night's meeting.
Instead members of the council
voted unanimously to support
the Foreign Scholarship Pro
gram next year.
Phil Nielsen, co-chairman of the
Foreign Scholarship Committee, said
that the IFC's vote of confidence
showed that Stanford fraternities
believed in continuing the program
in spite of the draft.
The original proposal, whereby
each fraternity would contribute $35
a quarter for room, board, and
â€¢-pending money for a foreign stu
dent, was proposed by the Foreign
Scholarship Committee to help fra
ternities weather the draft situation
and the effect on manpower.
In view of the IFC's vote of confi
dence the Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee will bring over seven scholars
as previously planned. Fraternities
will continue to finance the students
on an individual basis.
Resides fraternities, women's and
men's living groups give room and
hoard to foreign scholarship stu
dents. The University provides one
half the tuition; the ASSU the other
half, and the government provides
travel expenses.
