# Watch Out For Card Hurdlers, Jumpers
## Bryan, Kreitz Pace Strong Hurdle Fielo 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Stanford's 1951 track team will again field a deep, powerfi
hurdle corps that promises to sweep many dual cinder meets.
The Cards' high hurdle hopes were greatly bolstered when
was learned that Darrell Kreitz, who seriously injured his htr.
string muscle in a meet last season, will be able to compete agai

this year.
Kreitz, who has an all-time best
of 14.3 in the 120-yard high hurdles,
is now working mainly on speed,
and hopes to be in good shape when
the season starts.
Sophomore Bob Mathias, world
decathlon champion, plans to com
pete in the high hurdles this coming
season. He is a former state cham
pion in this event, and was credited
with a very respectable 14.5 effort
last season.
Storum Helps Also
Bill Storum, a junior, provides
the one - two - three punch in the
highs. Storum, who doubles as a
relay man, has plenty of speed and
could easily improve on his all-time
mark of 14.8 seconds. Pete Young,
who ran the highs as a freshman
four years ago, will give the Indians
added depth.
Stanford has one of the best col
legiate low hurdlers in the country,
Bob Bryan, who placed second in
the NCAA meet at Baltimore last
year.
Unfortunately, Bryan has con
tacted a mild case of mononucleosis
and will be unable to compete in the
Long Beach Relays tomorrow. How
ever, it is hoped that Bryan will be
ready to go when the regular sea
son starts two weeks from tomor
row.
Bryan Has Help
Backing up Bryan in the lows will
be Storum, Jim Pollock, and Bob
Magee. All three boys are very fast
and should have good seasons.
As it has been for the past few
years, the distance running outlook
can only be described as fair.
Veteran John Woolley and sopho
more Bob Simon lead the mile pros
pects for the coming season. Wool
ley, who has an all-time mark of
4.23, turned in several good races
last year including a close victory
over favored Bruins Fred Beck and
Don Hangen in the UCLA meet.
The long-striding Card miler has
been working mostly on speed so
far this year.
Kaufman, Griffin Handle Two-Mile
Simon, who ran both the mile and
the half-mile as a frosh last year,
has been credited with a 4:25 mile,
and hopes to bring his time down
against varsity competition this sea
son.
John Kaufman, up from San Ma
teo Junior College, and George
Griffin, up from the frosh, are Stan
ford's leading two - mile prospects.
Both have been clocked at around
the 10-minute mark in practice this
year.
