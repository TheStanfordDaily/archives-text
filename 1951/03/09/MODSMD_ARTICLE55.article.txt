# Baseballers Down El Toro Nine
## 
### 
. Stanford's varsity baseball squad
| made it five in a row yesterday
afternoon as they edged the El Toro
Marines 2 to 1. Yesterday's game
was a complete reversal of last 1
year's slugfest between the Marines .
and the Indians, in which 36 runs 1
| were scored on 37 base hits.
Starting chuckers Roger Osen
baugh for the Cards and Ed Tillman
of the Marines pitched tight no-hit
I ball for the first five frames. Osen
baugh put on an impressive demon
stration as he struck out seven men
in a row from the first to the third
inning. Marine right fielder Burt
Kleeves was the only man to reach
first base in the five innings that
Osenbaugh worked. He gained life
in the filth as he was nicked by one
: of Osenbaugh's pitches.
Jack Shepard opened the hitting
as lie doubled into left center field
;in the ; botlom of the sixth. Tom
Shaw advanced him to third, and
Dave Kosenkrantz brought him in
with a .sharp single down the left
field line.
The Marines tied it up in their
half of the seventh, when Joe Ver
banic singled off Bob Murphy and
was forced home as Murphy ran into j
control trouble, walking three men. ]
The Cards came right back in the
bottom of the seventh. Hal Hen
nacy led off by drawing a base on
balls and moved to second on Mur
phy's sacrifice. Hennacy scored
from second with the winning tally
as Marine shortstop Verbanic let
Art Abrahamson's hard-hit ground
er get through his legs.
