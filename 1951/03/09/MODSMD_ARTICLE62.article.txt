Horse Jockey Odds Comment
IUE CARD (Dean) 2-1 Looked good in last. Should repeat.
FAIR IIFAR (Evans) 3-1 On improve. A threat off last.
EL TROJAN (Dedeaux) :i-l Faded badly in last. Top rider.
BROKEN BRONC (Cottrell) 10-1 Tried often. Runs all the way.
RUINED BRUIN (Reichle) 20-1 Appears outclassed in this one.
The twenty-filth running of th CIBA Handicap shapes up as perhaps
the widest open race in its history. We are sticking with THE CARD
because he proved before that he can win the tough ones. Good jockey
will help pull through once again. FAIR BEAR is given the nod for
second place on basis of last years record when come up fast in home
stretch. Has lost a little in some places and gained it elsewhere. EL
TROJAN is always tough with Dedeaux up. A competitor of unques
tioned class. Makes CIBA Handicap winnings a habit, sharing honors
with Fair Bear at 10 each. BROKEN BRONC wins all the top ones, loses
the poor ones. May prove to be giant killer, but isn't what he used to be.
Usually thereabouts, but seldom "there." RUINED BRUIN has only pro
verbial "fighting chance." Hit hard after last one when ran dead last.
Would fill any position below last easily. Likes to run, but has taken
jnly one Handicap.
