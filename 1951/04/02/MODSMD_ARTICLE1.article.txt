## Big Four Deputies Scrap Side Issues 
### 
PARIS, April I (UP) â€”The pros
pects of a preliminary East-West
agreement appeared better today
than at any time since the Big Four
deputies started work here four
weeks ago on the agenda for a full
scale foreign ministers' conference.
Although Western diplomats still
saw little hope that a Big Four
conference could settle the cold war
in Europe, the deputies seemed at
least to be headed for agreement on
the agenda that will make such a
meeting possible.
Soviet Deputy Andrei A. Gro
myko was said to have scrapped his
demand for discussion of the Atlan
tic Pact, alleged American military
bases in the Middle East, alleged
Western violations of the Italian
peace treaty, and the matters of de
nazification and war criminals in
Germany and Austria.
In return, the deputies for the
U.S., Britain, and France dropped
their demand for a discussion of
breaches of the Balkan satellite
peace treaties.
