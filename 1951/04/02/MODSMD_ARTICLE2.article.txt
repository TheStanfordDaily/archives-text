TOKYO, Monday, April 2â€”Amer
ican tanks slashed across the 38th
parallel in another lightning foray
Sunday and inflicted heavy damage
on enemy troops which were mass
ing for what may be a great coun
tcrofTcnsivc.
A second South Korean division
shoved across the border at the cast
end of the line Saturday and front
dispatches Sunday said the republi
can troops field a salient 10 to 15
miles wide extending as far north
as 12 miles above the parallel.
UN planes hammered away at the
enemy buildup area just northeast
of the Uijongbu area above Seoul
and day- and night-flying fighters
and bombers strafed the thousands
of enemy vehicles and columns of
troops moving southward.
There were increasing indications
that the enemy withdrawal was a
breathing spell only and that there
was no let-up in Communist prepa
rations for a spring offensive with
possibly 40 to 45 fresh divisions.
