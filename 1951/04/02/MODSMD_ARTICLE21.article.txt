# About the New Draft Law
## 
### 
Last v/eek, while most of us were taking it
easy in sunny California, the Truman Adminis
tration was busy adding another regulation to
the Selective Service act of 1948.
As a consequence of the newborn regulation
which was turned into law by President Tru
man just two days ago—you and I can register
today with a little more assurance that we'll
be.regging again next fall —if we want to con
tinue school.
Here's the way the new regulation works:
If freshmen, sophomores, and juniors want
to finish out their college educations, they will
have to make a grade of 70 or over on a ''Se
lective Service Qualification Test"—Oß be in
the top half, top two-thirds, or top three-fourths
of their respective classes.
Jf seniors want to qo on to grad school, they
will in turn have to make a grade of 75 or over
on the test, OR be in the top half of their
senior class.
High school seniors will also be given a
chance to take the test. If their grades are 70 or
over, they too, will be assured of a college
education.
The test will be given college men only
once. If, say, a freshman or sophomore makes
better than a 70, he will be allowed to finish his
college education and even go on to grad
school if he desires. It will make no difference
what his subsequent grade point average is—
so long as he can stay in school and meet his
school's scholastic requirements.
If a student refuses to take the test and still
wants to finish college or go to grad school, he
must remain in the required upper bracket of
his class to keep his deferment.
It is percentage, then, to take the exam.
Moreover, because Stanford is recognized as
one of the ''tougher" schools to enter, most
Stanford students should be able to clear the
70 or 75 mark easily.
To some, undoubtedly, the whole test setup
sounds like a soft touch—an easy way to stay
in school and avoid the draft. Actually, how
ever, there's more than a little shrewd reason
ing behind what goes on in the Washington
minds.
The best experts in the capitol city look for

a national emergency that may last as long as
30 years. The reason: we are up against not
only a physical enemy (the Communist state
and its satellites), but also an ideological one
(communism as a government and a way of
life).
To paraphrase Mr. Francis Brown, staff as
sociate of the American Council on Education
who works closely with Gen. Hershey, we will
need not only a powerful force of men to de
feat the communist armies, but also an even
more powerful force of brainpower and ideol
ogy to combat those very persuasive ideas of
our enemies.
That's why the administration is letting us
finish school—all of us, regardless of our ma
jors. Businessmen, politicians, and journalists,
to name only a few, will be just as important in
fighting our long range battle of ideologies as
engineers, doctors, and front-liners are sure to
be.
Stanford University and the Daily have long
been in favor of a constant flow of trained per
sonnel with which to meet our enemies most
effectively. As Men's Counselor Richard
Balch commented yesterday,"the United
States has never won a war by means of its
manpower alone; we have won wars with
brainpower and will continue to do so."
It would be a gross misstatement made in
ignorance of the world situation today to say
that we as college students are "not doing our
part" by failing to join in the current physical
battle. Sooner or later, because the emergency
will most probably be a long-term one, all of
us will be holding down jobs with the army or
one of this nation's essential industries.
The point is that once we do join, or are
forced to join, we will be prepared to serve our
country in the best way possible as college
graduates—whether we be doctors, engineers,
propagandists, supply technicians, or combat
officers.
The long-term aspect of this thing is a
frightening one. It won't be a short war—like
the last one and the one in 1914. If we lose
ideological battle, we are liable to lose the
physical battle, and go down for the full count.
Let's be prepared for both!

one of the ''tougher" schools to enter, most
Stanford students should be able to clear the
70 or 75 mark easily.
To some, undoubtedly, the whole test setup
sounds like a soft touch—an easy way to stay
in school and avoid the draft. Actually, how
ever, there's more than a little shrewd reason
ing behind what goes on in the Washington
minds.
The best experts in the capitol city look for

a national emergency that may last as long as
30 years. The reason: we are up against not
only a physical enemy (the Communist state
and its satellites), but also an ideological one
(communism as a government and a way of
life).
To paraphrase Mr. Francis Brown, staff as
sociate of the American Council on Education
who works closely with Gen. Hershey, we will
need not only a powerful force of men to de
feat the communist armies, but also an even
more powerful force of brainpower and ideol
ogy to combat those very persuasive ideas of
our enemies.
That's why the administration is letting us
finish school—all of us, regardless of our ma
jors. Businessmen, politicians, and journalists,
to name only a few, will be just as important in
fighting our long range battle of ideologies as
engineers, doctors, and front-liners are sure to
be.
Stanford University and the Daily have long
been in favor of a constant flow of trained per
sonnel with which to meet our enemies most
effectively. As Men's Counselor Richard
Balch commented yesterday,"the United
States has never won a war by means of its
manpower alone; we have won wars with
brainpower and will continue to do so."
It would be a gross misstatement made in
ignorance of the world situation today to say
that we as college students are "not doing our
part" by failing to join in the current physical
battle. Sooner or later, because the emergency
will most probably be a long-term one, all of
us will be holding down jobs with the army or
one of this nation's essential industries.
The point is that once we do join, or are
forced to join, we will be prepared to serve our
country in the best way possible as college
graduates—whether we be doctors, engineers,
propagandists, supply technicians, or combat
officers.
The long-term aspect of this thing is a
frightening one. It won't be a short war—like
the last one and the one in 1914. If we lose
ideological battle, we are liable to lose the
physical battle, and go down for the full count.
Let's be prepared for both!
Last v/eek, while most of us were taking it
easy in sunny California, the Truman Adminis
tration was busy adding another regulation to
the Selective Service act of 1948.
As a consequence of the newborn regulation
which was turned into law by President Tru
man just two days ago—you and I can register
today with a little more assurance that we'll
be.regging again next fall —if we want to con
tinue school.
Here's the way the new regulation works:
If freshmen, sophomores, and juniors want
to finish out their college educations, they will
have to make a grade of 70 or over on a ''Se
lective Service Qualification Test"—Oß be in
the top half, top two-thirds, or top three-fourths
of their respective classes.
Jf seniors want to qo on to grad school, they
will in turn have to make a grade of 75 or over
on the test, OR be in the top half of their
senior class.
High school seniors will also be given a
chance to take the test. If their grades are 70 or
over, they too, will be assured of a college
education.
The test will be given college men only
once. If, say, a freshman or sophomore makes
better than a 70, he will be allowed to finish his
college education and even go on to grad
school if he desires. It will make no difference
what his subsequent grade point average is—
so long as he can stay in school and meet his
school's scholastic requirements.
If a student refuses to take the test and still
wants to finish college or go to grad school, he
must remain in the required upper bracket of
his class to keep his deferment.
It is percentage, then, to take the exam.
Moreover, because Stanford is recognized as
one of the ''tougher" schools to enter, most
Stanford students should be able to clear the
70 or 75 mark easily.

that we as college students are "not doing our
part" by failing to join in the current physical
battle. Sooner or later, because the emergency
will most probably be a long-term one, all of
us will be holding down jobs with the army or
one of this nation's essential industries.
The point is that once we do join, or are
forced to join, we will be prepared to serve our
country in the best way possible as college
graduates—whether we be doctors, engineers,
propagandists, supply technicians, or combat
officers.
The long-term aspect of this thing is a
frightening one. It won't be a short war—like
the last one and the one in 1914. If we lose
ideological battle, we are liable to lose the
physical battle, and go down for the full count.
Let's be prepared for both!
