# Biology Men Tell of Trip
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Three Stanford students who
went to Mexico last summer in
search of material for their Masters'
theses in biology came home with
their car full of specimens and their
minds full of memories of a friendly
people.
The students were John Figg-
Hoblyn, Jay Savage, and John La
mont. Their expedition lasted two
months and covered 3,600 miles of
the state of Sonora.
Their collection was described as
the first extensive collection of in
sects, reptiles, and amphibia made
in that area. They were accompa
nied on part of the trip by -Mrs.
Lamont.
Figg-Hoblyn, who was mainly in
terested in insects, collected over
5,000 specimens, of which about ten
or twelve are new species of beetles.
Savage and Lamont gathered
more than 700 specimens of reptiles
and amphibia, including a new spe
cies of toad. As yet all of the speci
mens have not been checked.
The biologists were impressed by
the friendliness and hospitality of
the people.
They said when they ran out of
gas, farmers helped them without
accepting anything in return.
When they visited the village of
Atil, the 500 inhabitants staged a big
dance and celebration in their hon
or. All through dinner, beautiful
girls were brought in and intro
duced to the travelers.
