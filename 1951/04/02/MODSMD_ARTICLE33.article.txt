# CIVIL DEFENSE
## Faculty, Living Group Indoctrination Is Planned 
### 
Plans for indoctrinating all
campus residents "not directly
concerned with civilian defense"
during spring quarter were out
lined yesterday by Alf Brandin,
Stanford's director of civil de
fense defense.
Brandin said his office would issue
directives to every department head
in the University, containing in
structions on "what to do in case of
attack."
He said the department heads
would be asked to indoctrinate their
faculty members, who would then
take charge of their respective
classes in the event of an assault
during class hours.
Students will also be indoctrin
ated indirectly through living group
directors and resident assistants,
Brandin said. Directors and R.A.'s
will meet during the quarter with
Men's Counselor Richard Balch and
Director of Residence Anastasia
Doyle for the necessary instructions,
he added.
Brandin also announced that
classes conducted by the Palo Alto
Area Chapter of the Red Cross will
begin this quarter to teach all cam
pus civilian defense workers first
aid.
Tying down the CD agenda for
this qUarter will be the completion
of signing by civilian defense work
ers of the state (Levering) loyalty
oath. The oath is required of all
state employees — civilian defense
and otherwise — and has already
been signed by members of campus
ROTC units participating in defense
activities.
Brandin announced that the joint
air raid siren test, conducted last
Friday at 7 p.m. by Menlo Park, Los
Altos, Palo Alto, and Stanford, was
a success. He said reception was
good "from all directions."
Both the firehouse whistle and a
similar whistle atop the steam plant
were used to warn the campus,
Brandin stated. The combined

blasts lasted for "about one min
i ute," he concluded.
