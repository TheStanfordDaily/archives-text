# Indians Down Fresno
## Trackmen Also Whip Bears 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
Stanford's sophomore cinder star,
Bob Mathias, sparked his Indian
teammates to a pair of dual meet vic
tories as the Cards crushed a weak
Cal squad in the Big Meet Relays,
' 45 to 15, and downed Fresno State
by 77 2/5 to 53 3/5.
Mathias, who is abandoning his
decathlon activities to concentrate on
i the discus, shot, and hurdles, nabbed
a first in the discus and second in
the shot against the Bears on March
' 24. Against Fresno last Saturday he
scored 13 points in winning the discus
and low hurdles and taking second in
j the shot.
Discus Record Broken
Mathias' 1(50 it 3 5/8 in. discus toss
! in the Fresno set a new meet mark,
breaking the record of 157 ft. 2 1/2 in.
i made by Stanford's Hugh Griggen in
i 1938.
The decathlon champ's 150 ft. 3 1/2
in. throw in the California fray led a
quartet of Card platter tossers to a
new aggregate total of 582 ft. 7 3/4 in.
Marks of the other team members
1 were: Jack Burke, 14G ft. 5 1/2 in.;
lan Reed, 144 ft. 3 in.; Chuck Renfro,
141 ft. 5 in. This mark broke the pre
: vious standard of 555 ft. 10 in. set by
! a Cal foursome in 1940.
Sprinter Wilbur Taylor was also a
double victor for the Indians in the
Fresno spikefest. He took the 100 in
10.1 and won the furlong with an
! excellent 21.3 clocking. The 220 time
: rates as one of the fastest outdoor
I marks in the nation this season.
3:18 Relay Against Bears
Taylor teamed up with BiH Storum,
Friedrichs, and Cass Bly to set a new
Fresno meet record of 3:21.9 in the
mile relay. However, this perform
ance did not equal their time of the
previous week, when the same team
ran 3:18.
Other standouts for the Cards were
sophomore Norm Jiles, who high
■ jumped 6 ft. 3 1/4 in. against Fresno;
! shotputter Lew Davis with a heave
of 51 ft. 5 3/8 in. against Cal; and
Merritt Van Sant who broad jumped
| 23 ft. 5 1/2 in. against Fresno.
In the Cal meet the Stanfordites
, won all running events and three
, field contests, losing only in the jave
lin, broad jump, and pole vault.
s j California's thin-clads, rated as one
~ of the worst Bear squads since 1932,
seem doomed to a very poor season.
Following their defeat at the hands of
. the Indians, they lost another deci-
J sion last Saturday to San Jose State.
