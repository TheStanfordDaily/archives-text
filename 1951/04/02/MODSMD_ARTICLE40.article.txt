## Indian Nine Edged Twice By Trojans 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford's defending champion CIBA baseball team received a
rude jolt this weekend as they opened the current season by
dropping a pair of tight games to USC on the Trojan campus.
USC won Friday's game, 9 to 6, as shortstop Bob Lillis blasted
one out of the park with two outs and two men on base in the

bottom half of the ninth inning. The j
Trojans had to come from behind
with a five-run outburst in the eighth
frame of Saturday's game to nio the
Cards. 10 to 9.
Pitchers Lose Control
Lack of control by Stanford's :
pitchers was the largest factor in the
double loss, as Roger Osenbaugh
gave up nine bases on balls in the
first game and Jim Claypool and Bob
Murphy issued 10 free passes to first
in Saturday's battle.
Troy was able to tap Osenbaugh for
only five hits in Friday's game, how
ever, three of them were home runs,
to account for six of their nine runs.
Stanford opened the game with one
run in the first inning on Art Abra
hamson's triple and Chuck Essegian's

the ball game in the ninth frame as
Essegian led oft' with a walk, Corzine j
sacrificed him to second. Tow Shaw
gained life on an error as Essegian
went to third. Jim Castagnoli at
tempted to squeeze Essegian home.
However, relief hurler Tom Kemp
was able to reach the ball in time to
(ire home and nip Essegian before he
reached the plate. Pinchhitter Dick
Cole grounded out to end the game.
Stanford opened their big week
with a 10 to 6 win over Compcon Col
lege last Saturday. Monday night
they were manhandled, 24 to 16, by
the University of California at Santa
Barbara in a scoring marathon that
lasted four hours. The Cards evened
the Santa Barbara series Tuesday as
they edged the Gauchos, 7 to 5, in
their final game before their CIBA
opener with the Trojans.
The Card nine will take another
crack at CIBA competition this
weekend', when they meet Cal Fri
day, and tangle with Santa Clara in
a double header Saturday.

Saturday the Indians jumped into
an early lead again with two runs in j
the opening frame. USC knotted the
count, 2 to 2. with one run in the first
and third innings. Stanford tallied
once in the fourth, twice in the fifth,
one once more in the sixth to go
ahead, 6 to 4.

I Corzine stepped into Cesca's first de- j

field fence to give the Cards a com

USC picked up one run in the sev- |

eighth. Jim Claypool, who had s
worked the first seven frames on the ]
mound for the Indians, walked lead- j
off batter Tom Riacli, fed a single to
Stan Charnofsky, and passed pinch
hitter Bill Prince to load the bags.

Coach Everett Dean sent sopho
more Bob Murphy in to relieve the
tiring Claypool on the hill. A 1 Karan
blasted Murphy's fifth pitch into left
field for two bases to score Riach and
Charnofsky. Two walks and two

Stanford's defending champion CIBA baseball team received a
rude jolt this weekend as they opened the current season by
dropping a pair of tight games to USC on the Trojan campus.
USC won Friday's game, 9 to 6, as shortstop Bob Lillis blasted
one out of the park with two outs and two men on base in the

bottom half of the ninth inning. The j
Trojans had to come from behind
with a five-run outburst in the eighth
frame of Saturday's game to nio the
Cards. 10 to 9.
Pitchers Lose Control
Lack of control by Stanford's :
pitchers was the largest factor in the
double loss, as Roger Osenbaugh
gave up nine bases on balls in the
first game and Jim Claypool and Bob
Murphy issued 10 free passes to first
in Saturday's battle.
Troy was able to tap Osenbaugh for
only five hits in Friday's game, how
ever, three of them were home runs,
to account for six of their nine runs.
Stanford opened the game with one
run in the first inning on Art Abra
hamson's triple and Chuck Essegian's

the ball game in the ninth frame as
Essegian led oft' with a walk, Corzine j
sacrificed him to second. Tow Shaw
gained life on an error as Essegian
went to third. Jim Castagnoli at
tempted to squeeze Essegian home.
However, relief hurler Tom Kemp
was able to reach the ball in time to
(ire home and nip Essegian before he
reached the plate. Pinchhitter Dick
Cole grounded out to end the game.
Stanford opened their big week
with a 10 to 6 win over Compcon Col
lege last Saturday. Monday night
they were manhandled, 24 to 16, by
the University of California at Santa
Barbara in a scoring marathon that
lasted four hours. The Cards evened
the Santa Barbara series Tuesday as
they edged the Gauchos, 7 to 5, in
their final game before their CIBA
opener with the Trojans.
The Card nine will take another
crack at CIBA competition this
weekend', when they meet Cal Fri
day, and tangle with Santa Clara in
a double header Saturday.
