Graduate students and faculty
members from five California uni
-1 versities and engineers from San
! Francisco Bay Area firms will meet
at Stanford this summer for the
j fourth annual Heat Transfer and
i Fluid Mechanics Institute.
Professor A. L. London of Stan
ford's department of mechanical en
gineering announced today that sev
eral hundred scientists would meet
June 20 to 22 to keep in touch with
| the latest advances in the fields of
heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and
j related subjects.
