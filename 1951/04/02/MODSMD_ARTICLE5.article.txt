# NEW LAW ALTERS DRAFT STATUS
## 
### 
President Truman Saturday au
thorized deferment from the draft of
college students who make good
enough grades or pass an aptitude
test.
The regulation became law with
the President's signature and will
be binding on all the nation's 4,000
draft boards.
The new law m-ovides for au
tomatic deferment of college
freshmen in the upper half of
their class, deferment of spoho
morcs in the upper two-thirds of
their class, juniors in the upper
three-fourths of their class, and
seniors in the upper half of their
class.
This means that half the fresh
men, two-thirds of the sophomores,
three-fourths of the juniors, and

half the seniors in colleges and uni
versities will be automatically de
ferred to continue their schooling.
The second possibility for defer
ment under the new law lies in tak
ing an aptitude test.
This aptitude test, which is
comparable to the Arniv General
Classification Test (AGCT), will
he given to all college students on
May 2<i, June 16, and June 30, The
i test will be given at Stanford Uni
versity for Stanford students.
College students are eligible for
I deferment either by being in the
respective scholastic bracket or by
passing the aptitude test with a
score of 70 or better.
Seniors intending to go into grad
i uate work must either be in the
i upper half of the senior class or

pass the aptitude test with a score
of 70. The test is based on 100 per
cent.
The test will he given by the
Educational Testing Service of
Princeton, N.J. Application blanks
will be available to students April
12. These blanks will enable stu
dents to petition their draft board
for an opportunity to take the ex
amination. There is no chargc for
the test.
Where to obtain blanks and
where the test will be given will
also be announced April 12.
Whether students should petition
their home draft boards or the draft
board nearest the university they
attend is not yet known.
Chief Counselor for Men Rich
ard Balch recommended that all

1 Stanford students subject to draft
take the test. It is #ood insurance,
he pointed out, for if a student
passes the test with 70 percent, he
j is eligible for deferment even if
he falls below the required class
standing for deferment. The test
will be given to each student only
| once.
ROTC, NROTC, and AROTC stu
j dents do not have to take the test
because they are already deferred
until graduation. Balch urged these
students to continue in the reserve
training programs.
Whether or not men passing the
aptitude test will be counted in de
termining the upper part of a class
is not yet known, Balch said, but
will be clarified in the near future.
The basic idea behind the defer

ment of college students was ex
pressed by Francis J. Brown, Wash
! ington representative of the Ameri
can Council on Education, in St.
i Louis last Friday at a conference
of the National Association of Deans
and Advisers of Men.
The idea, Brown said, is this: "We
are now in the initial stages of
what may well be the Thirty Years'
War of the twentieth century, a
continuous period of tension inter
spersed by actual combat.
"If this is true, the welfare of the
nation makes it imperative that we
retain a continuing flow of men and
women of high ability through our
institutions of higher education to
proivde leadership in every area of
i American life and in our relations

with the nations of the world."
What this essentially means, i
Balch said, is that the United States i
needs the leadership and brainpow
er provided by American colleges if
we are to defeat the Communist :
ideology.
Balch pointed out that the de
ferment is only a deferment. Stu
dents may still have to take their
turn at military service, but only
after they have completed college
(provided they meet one of the
two requirements for deferment).
A student can therefore contrib
ute the maximum to the nation's
welfare by finishing his college ed
ucation, Balch added.
The following are some types of j
questions similar to those students <
will face in the aptitude. The ques- j

tions were prepared by the Educa
tional Testing Service which will
| also prepare the aptitude test
One type consists of reading a
passage, then answering questions
concerning the passage. The ques
tions are multiple choice with five
j choices.
Another type consists of a capi
j talized word, then five words iron
I which to choose a word that most
nearly conveys the *ame meaning as
the capitalized word.
A third type consists of simple
mathematical problems. An exam
ple is, "If three pencils cost ten
cents, how many pencils can be
| bought with 30 cents?"

Chief Counselor for Men Rich
ard Balch recommended that all

1 Stanford students subject to draft
take the test. It is #ood insurance,
he pointed out, for if a student
passes the test with 70 percent, he
j is eligible for deferment even if
he falls below the required class
standing for deferment. The test
will be given to each student only
| once.
ROTC, NROTC, and AROTC stu
j dents do not have to take the test
because they are already deferred
until graduation. Balch urged these
students to continue in the reserve
training programs.
Whether or not men passing the
aptitude test will be counted in de
termining the upper part of a class
is not yet known, Balch said, but
will be clarified in the near future.
The basic idea behind the defer

ment of college students was ex
pressed by Francis J. Brown, Wash
! ington representative of the Ameri
can Council on Education, in St.
i Louis last Friday at a conference
of the National Association of Deans
and Advisers of Men.
The idea, Brown said, is this: "We
are now in the initial stages of
what may well be the Thirty Years'
War of the twentieth century, a
continuous period of tension inter
spersed by actual combat.
"If this is true, the welfare of the
nation makes it imperative that we
retain a continuing flow of men and
women of high ability through our
institutions of higher education to
proivde leadership in every area of
i American life and in our relations

with the nations of the world."
What this essentially means, i
Balch said, is that the United States i
needs the leadership and brainpow
er provided by American colleges if
we are to defeat the Communist :
ideology.
Balch pointed out that the de
ferment is only a deferment. Stu
dents may still have to take their
turn at military service, but only
after they have completed college
(provided they meet one of the
two requirements for deferment).
A student can therefore contrib
ute the maximum to the nation's
welfare by finishing his college ed
ucation, Balch added.
The following are some types of j
questions similar to those students <
will face in the aptitude. The ques- j

tions were prepared by the Educa
tional Testing Service which will
| also prepare the aptitude test
One type consists of reading a
passage, then answering questions
concerning the passage. The ques
tions are multiple choice with five
j choices.
Another type consists of a capi
j talized word, then five words iron
I which to choose a word that most
nearly conveys the *ame meaning as
the capitalized word.
A third type consists of simple
mathematical problems. An exam
ple is, "If three pencils cost ten
cents, how many pencils can be
| bought with 30 cents?"

ment.)
President Truman Saturday au
thorized deferment from the draft of
college students who make good
enough grades or pass an aptitude
test.
The regulation became law with
the President's signature and will
be binding on all the nation's 4,000
draft boards.
The new law m-ovides for au
tomatic deferment of college
freshmen in the upper half of
their class, deferment of spoho
morcs in the upper two-thirds of
their class, juniors in the upper
three-fourths of their class, and
seniors in the upper half of their
class.
This means that half the fresh
men, two-thirds of the sophomores,
three-fourths of the juniors, and

half the seniors in colleges and uni
versities will be automatically de
ferred to continue their schooling.
The second possibility for defer
ment under the new law lies in tak
ing an aptitude test.
This aptitude test, which is
comparable to the Arniv General
Classification Test (AGCT), will
he given to all college students on
May 2<i, June 16, and June 30, The
i test will be given at Stanford Uni
versity for Stanford students.
College students are eligible for
I deferment either by being in the
respective scholastic bracket or by
passing the aptitude test with a
score of 70 or better.
Seniors intending to go into grad
i uate work must either be in the
i upper half of the senior class or

pass the aptitude test with a score
of 70. The test is based on 100 per
cent.
The test will he given by the
Educational Testing Service of
Princeton, N.J. Application blanks
will be available to students April
12. These blanks will enable stu
dents to petition their draft board
for an opportunity to take the ex
amination. There is no chargc for
the test.
Where to obtain blanks and
where the test will be given will
also be announced April 12.

welfare by finishing his college ed

The following are some types of j
questions similar to those students <
will face in the aptitude. The ques- j

tions were prepared by the Educa
tional Testing Service which will
| also prepare the aptitude test
One type consists of reading a
passage, then answering questions
concerning the passage. The ques
tions are multiple choice with five
j choices.
Another type consists of a capi
j talized word, then five words iron
I which to choose a word that most
nearly conveys the *ame meaning as
the capitalized word.
A third type consists of simple
mathematical problems. An exam
ple is, "If three pencils cost ten
cents, how many pencils can be
| bought with 30 cents?"

President Truman Saturday au
thorized deferment from the draft of
college students who make good
enough grades or pass an aptitude
test.
The regulation became law with
the President's signature and will
be binding on all the nation's 4,000
draft boards.
The new law m-ovides for au
tomatic deferment of college
freshmen in the upper half of
their class, deferment of spoho
morcs in the upper two-thirds of
their class, juniors in the upper
three-fourths of their class, and
seniors in the upper half of their
class.
This means that half the fresh
men, two-thirds of the sophomores,
three-fourths of the juniors, and

half the seniors in colleges and uni
versities will be automatically de
ferred to continue their schooling.
The second possibility for defer
ment under the new law lies in tak
ing an aptitude test.
This aptitude test, which is
comparable to the Arniv General
Classification Test (AGCT), will
he given to all college students on
May 2<i, June 16, and June 30, The
i test will be given at Stanford Uni
versity for Stanford students.
College students are eligible for
I deferment either by being in the
respective scholastic bracket or by
passing the aptitude test with a
score of 70 or better.
Seniors intending to go into grad
i uate work must either be in the
i upper half of the senior class or

pass the aptitude test with a score
of 70. The test is based on 100 per
cent.
The test will he given by the
Educational Testing Service of
Princeton, N.J. Application blanks
will be available to students April
12. These blanks will enable stu
dents to petition their draft board
for an opportunity to take the ex
amination. There is no chargc for
the test.
Where to obtain blanks and
where the test will be given will
also be announced April 12.
Whether students should petition
their home draft boards or the draft
board nearest the university they
attend is not yet known.
Chief Counselor for Men Rich
ard Balch recommended that all

1 Stanford students subject to draft
take the test. It is #ood insurance,
he pointed out, for if a student
passes the test with 70 percent, he
j is eligible for deferment even if
he falls below the required class
standing for deferment. The test
will be given to each student only
| once.
ROTC, NROTC, and AROTC stu
j dents do not have to take the test
because they are already deferred
until graduation. Balch urged these
students to continue in the reserve
training programs.
Whether or not men passing the
aptitude test will be counted in de
termining the upper part of a class
is not yet known, Balch said, but
will be clarified in the near future.
The basic idea behind the defer

ment of college students was ex
pressed by Francis J. Brown, Wash
! ington representative of the Ameri
can Council on Education, in St.
i Louis last Friday at a conference
of the National Association of Deans
and Advisers of Men.
The idea, Brown said, is this: "We
are now in the initial stages of
what may well be the Thirty Years'
War of the twentieth century, a
continuous period of tension inter
spersed by actual combat.
"If this is true, the welfare of the
nation makes it imperative that we
retain a continuing flow of men and
women of high ability through our
institutions of higher education to
proivde leadership in every area of
i American life and in our relations

with the nations of the world."
What this essentially means, i
Balch said, is that the United States i
needs the leadership and brainpow
er provided by American colleges if
we are to defeat the Communist :
ideology.
Balch pointed out that the de
ferment is only a deferment. Stu
dents may still have to take their
turn at military service, but only
after they have completed college
(provided they meet one of the
two requirements for deferment).
A student can therefore contrib
ute the maximum to the nation's
welfare by finishing his college ed
ucation, Balch added.
