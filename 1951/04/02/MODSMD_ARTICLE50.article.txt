# SENIOR REUNION
## 
### 
The senior class will repeat its
I get-together of last quarter at a
reunion Wednesday night in the
; back room of L'Ommie's.
Entertainment has been planned,
but the major purpose of the affair,
according to Ann Peterson, Senior
Class Excom member, is just to give
the members of the Class of '51 an
opportunity to meet and talk over
old times.
Jan Edwards is in charge of the
program. The reunion will begin at
8:30 and continue until L'Ommie's
closes.
