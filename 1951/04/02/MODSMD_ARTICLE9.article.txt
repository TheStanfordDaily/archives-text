# Bok Will Miss Rome Congress
## No Official Statement Given Yet 
### 
Derek Bok, chosen by Excom j
as Stanford's official delegate to !
the Rome Peace Congress will;
not be in Rome as the Congress j
opens today. Instead he will be
registering at Stanford along
with the rest of the student
body.
As the Daily went to press last
night, neither Bok nor Ted Buttner,
ASSU president, had returned to the j
Farm, so no official explanation for
j Bok's not making the trip was avail
j able.
Bok's appointment as delegate had
I been made subject to the collection
of sufficient funds ($700) to finance
the trip. The former Encina head
sponsor agreed to pay up to $200 from
his own pocket, which would have
been enough provided Air France
j Airlines allowed the delegate a re
duced transportation rate to and from
j the Congress.
Dot Thomas, Excom Women's Halls
( representative, and Buttner con
i tacted the airline during finals week.
The San Francisco office of Air
j France pointed out that a Civil Aero
nautics ruling allows reduced rates
I for students going abroad to study,
and the company postponed an im
| mediate decision which would have
| extended the lower rate to a confer
j encc delegate.
According to Miss Imogen Aten,
j ASSU office manager, Bok waited
until March 23 for word from the air
! line. Two days later, Air France
! came forth with the lower rate, but
I Bok had already made other plans.
The Student. Federalists arc redis
tributing the funds collected to fi
| nance the trip to Rome. A more com-
I plete explanation of this final devel
] opment in the Rome delegate issue
j will appear in tomorrow's Daily.
