## Gen. Mac Arthur Estimates Strength of Korean Reds Enemy Is Geared to Launch 630,000 Man Spring Attack 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, April 3 (UP) — Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur
warned today that the regrouping North Korean and Chinese
enemy has a potential strength of at least 63 divisions—the great
est of any period in the Korean campaign.
At full division strength, that would mean the Communists are

geared to launch a spring offensive I
with up to 630,000 men.
According to Allied officers, the j
Reds apparently are holding up j
their offensive to take advantage of \
the rainy season that will mire Al
lied armor and give an advantage to
"human waves" of Red foot sol- j
diers.
Issuing an implied warning of
more grim days to comc in the Ko
rean fighting, the United Nations i
supreme commander said in a com
munique, "The compensating fac
tors arc the vulnerability of the
Reds' communications and their
limited logistic capacity."
American patrols roamed across |
the 38th parallel almost at will yes
terday, and an Eighth Army spokes- i
man reported that all along the line i
it. was "continued advance against
little or no enemy opposition."
An American tank and infantry
team crossed into North Korea for
the third straight day to test enemy
positions and then withdrew. Foot
soldiers also made frequent "casual"
forays across the border at several
points in the Uijongbu area and re
ported the Communists were mining
Ihe roads to hold back any Allied :
thrust.
But. above Chunchon Red troops
screening the main enemy build-up
area to the north were entrenched
in strength and threw back an Al
lied attack about three miles below
the parallel.


TRAPPED —Engineers ponder the problem of two M-4 tanks that are stuck at a bridge north of
Uijongbu. The rear tank collapsed the bridge while trying to cross, and the forward tank hit a
mine when it tried to pull the first out of its self-made trap. —Acme Telephoto
