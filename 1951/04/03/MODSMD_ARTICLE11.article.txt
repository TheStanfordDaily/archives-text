# Seniors Will Try Course Evaluating
## 
### 
The Student-Faculty Educational
Commission put policy into action
last quarter by sending letters to all
University departments requesting
senior student - faculty conferences.
The conference committee has re
ceived favorable response from al
most all the departments, although
some feel that they are too small as
yet. to participate effectively in the
program.
The conferences will be carried on
in undergraduate departments only.
Because of their longer experience
with Stanford academic life, senior
students have been asked to par
ticipate rather than members of
other classes.
Students with particular criti
cisms as to courses and materials in
them are asked to convey their
opinions to senior students selected
for the discussions.
The letters suggested that five
teachers from the department hold
a round-table discussion with ten
graduating seniors. The purpose of
the discussions is to supply faculty
with impressions and opinions frqm
the students' viewpoint, and to dis
cover general problems and their
bases.
The committee also enclosed a list
of suggested topics to be taken up
in the discussions. They include
questions as to the adequacy of the
teaching in covering material, stress
on parts of the subject, and oppor
tunity for interested students to go
beyond minimum requirements.
Other topics concern amount and
fairness of work required, grading,
testing, and adequacy of textbooks
and department advising programs.
Finally, topics question whether
prerequisite courses prepare stu
dents for following ones, whether
the catalog accurately describes the
courses, and whether time conflicts
in the department, listings arc at a
minimum.
The committee has taken this line
of action because of an experiment
lin the Electrical Engineering De
! partment which was considered
: valuable to both teachers and stu
j dents.
If the studei*-faculty discussions
j prove successful, they will be car
ried on to enable every class to par
ticipate in the program before grad
uating.
Present members of the commit
tee are Dorothy Loekwood. Gordon
Addison, and Dave Diefendcrfer.
