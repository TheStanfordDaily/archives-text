# 6,452 Sign During Calm Reg Day Here
## 
### 
A reg day so quiet that it sqr
prised even Registrar Harvey Hpll
nevertheless sent the expected
number of students fumbling for
grade sheets, fountain pens, and
checkbooks yesterday.
On the basis of reg books collect
ed at Memorial Auditorium, figures
showed that 6,452 students have en
rolled. This marks a drop of 261
under the registration day figure for
last spring quarter. This drop, how

ever, marks no further proportional
decrease than the overall drop for
this year as compared to last.
"Things have gone very smoothly
and quietly," Hall commented with
some surprise late yesterday after
noon. Booths and tables in the Pa
vilion were being removed for the
reg dance even before the 5 o'clock
deadline. Usually there is a last
minute rush.
Hall said, however, that he still
saw no reason to revise his spring
quarter enrollment prediction of
7,000. "I think about 550 people
have decided to add a day or two
to their vacations," he went on.
A breakdown of yesterday's fig
ures showed that 4,642 men and
1,810 women had registered. This
marks an increase of 135 women and
a decrease of 396 men over figures
for registration day last spring
quarter.
A bright spot in the picture for
men is the ratio, which is now hov
ering between 2.5 and 2.6 men to
1 woman, a considerable change
from last spring's ratio of 3 to 1.
