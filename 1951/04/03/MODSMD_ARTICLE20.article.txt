# Rome Fiasco Ascribed To 'Time Lack'
## 
### 
Senior Derek Bok's failure to at
tend the Rome Congress this week
was ascribed to "a lack of time to
make the necessary preparations"
by ASSU President Ted Buttncr last
night.
Buttner, who returned to campus
after yesterday's Daily had gone to
prers, said he and Excom member
Dot Thomas had arranged with Air
France for Bok to take the March 27
plane from New York to Rome—at
a special student rate.
(Bok was unavailable for com
ment last night. He Ls cxpected
back on campus later this week,
having been detained in Los An
geles.)
Confirmation of the availability
of the special student rate (a 30 per
cent discount) was made known to
Bok by a letter from Air France
received on Friday of finals week,
just four days before he was sched- j
uled to enplane in New York.
However, according to Foreign
Scholarship Committee Co - Chair- |
man Phil Nielsen, Bok's travel visa
had not yet been mailed to him from |
New York and the Stanford dele
gate felt it impossible to make the ,
proper connections. He is reported j
to have gone ahead with other !
plans.
Buttner said he and Miss Thomas j
first began to negotiate with the j
airline about two days after Bok ;
j was selected by Excom to make the j
! Rome trip.
During dead week, Buttner stat- '
ed, word was received from the air- I
line that the delegate would have j
to be certified by the University as
a student traveling for educational
j purposes.
Buttner said the certification was j
gained the following week (finals j
week) and sent to Air France, which
promptly sent Bok his travel O.K.
Bok received the O.K. on Friday,!
the last day of finals.
The ASSU president said he had |
♦old Bok some time before Friday j
that he was to leave New York on
the 27th.
I
"But it was more a lack of time
to make the proper transportation
arrangements than anything else
that prevented Bok from going
through with the trip," Buttner told
The Daily yesterday.
Buttner reported ihal enough
money ($700) had been collected to
finance the journey previous to j
making the March 27 reservation.
Outside donations totaled approxi
mately $400, while Excom had con
tributed $100 and Bok himself had
agreed to put up $200.
The money donated is now being
redistributed to donors by mem
bers of the United Movement for
World Federation on campus, who
had volunteered to act as collection
agents during the weeks preceding
the proposed trip.

agreed to put up $200.

Senior Derek Bok's failure to at
tend the Rome Congress this week
was ascribed to "a lack of time to
make the necessary preparations"
by ASSU President Ted Buttncr last
night.
Buttner, who returned to campus
after yesterday's Daily had gone to
prers, said he and Excom member
Dot Thomas had arranged with Air
France for Bok to take the March 27
plane from New York to Rome—at
a special student rate.
(Bok was unavailable for com
ment last night. He Ls cxpected
back on campus later this week,
having been detained in Los An
geles.)
Confirmation of the availability
of the special student rate (a 30 per
cent discount) was made known to
Bok by a letter from Air France
received on Friday of finals week,
just four days before he was sched- j
uled to enplane in New York.
However, according to Foreign
Scholarship Committee Co - Chair- |
man Phil Nielsen, Bok's travel visa
had not yet been mailed to him from |
New York and the Stanford dele
gate felt it impossible to make the ,
proper connections. He is reported j
to have gone ahead with other !
plans.
Buttner said he and Miss Thomas j
first began to negotiate with the j
airline about two days after Bok ;
j was selected by Excom to make the j
! Rome trip.
During dead week, Buttner stat- '
ed, word was received from the air- I
line that the delegate would have j
to be certified by the University as
a student traveling for educational
j purposes.
Buttner said the certification was j
gained the following week (finals j
week) and sent to Air France, which
promptly sent Bok his travel O.K.
Bok received the O.K. on Friday,!
the last day of finals.
The ASSU president said he had |
♦old Bok some time before Friday j
that he was to leave New York on
the 27th.

"But it was more a lack of time
to make the proper transportation
arrangements than anything else
that prevented Bok from going
through with the trip," Buttner told
The Daily yesterday.
Buttner reported ihal enough
money ($700) had been collected to
finance the journey previous to j
making the March 27 reservation.
Outside donations totaled approxi
mately $400, while Excom had con
tributed $100 and Bok himself had
agreed to put up $200.
The money donated is now being
redistributed to donors by mem
bers of the United Movement for
