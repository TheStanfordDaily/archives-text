# Men Advised to Take
## Aptitude tests May 26 Class Standings Are 'Less Reliable' As Deferment Basis, Says Balch 
### 
The college student deferment bill signed by President Truman
Saturday bears further investigation—if students are to take full
advantage of the opportunities offered them.
The law provides for the deferment of college students who
make a grade of 70 on an aptitude test, or deferment of freshmen

in the upper half of their class,
sophomores in the upper two-thirds,
juniors in the upper three-fourths,
and seniors in the upper half.
Richard Balch, chief counselor for
men, pointed out that a passing
grade on the aptitude test (70 for «11
students except seniors entering
graduate work, 75 for them) is more
reliable grounds for deferment than
class standing.
In support of this claim, Balch
explained:
"As a student moves into each
successive year of his college edu
ration, his cla*s standing will be,
re-evaluated.
'"If a student once drops below
the dividing line which gives him
deferment, his deferment is can
celed automatically."
The situation works like this: A
freshman is eligible for deferment
if he is in the upper half of his clasr..
When that half of the class move#
into the sophomore bracket, the up
per two-thirds is eligible for de
ferment.
This means that one-third of th*
freshman class which becomes soph
omores will automatically become
subject to the draft.
When two-thirds of the sopho
more class moves into the junior
bracket, another one-fourth will In
draft - eligible. When what's left
gains senior standing, another half
will be subject to the draft.
If you work it nut mathemati-
I cally—assuming every student re
fused to take the aptitude test —
approximately seven out of ever;,
eight freshmen would become
draft-eligible at some time dm -
| ing the four-year co-liege period.
Only one out of eight would l»«
assured of completing his higher
education.
For this reason Balch recom
mended that all students subject to
the draft take the aptitude test
which will be given on campus May
26, June 16, and June 30. A score of
70 (75 for seniors) entitles students
to deferment until graduation.
Balch also urged students to tak*
the first examination on May 26 to
avoid the possibility of being draft
ed before taking advantage of all
opportunities for deferment.
He said students who fail to
make the prescribed score on the
aptitude test may find themselves
drafted before their class standing
has be#n evaluated by the coun
seling service. This evaluation
work will take up to 30 days to
complete, he said.
To avoid this, Balch urged stu
dents to petition their Jocal draft
boards for 30 days' grace from the
June 17 graduation date at Stanford
In this way men who fail to mak<*
the grade of 70 (75 for seniors plan
ning to enter graduate work) will
have an opportunity for deferment
if they are in the respective clas«
bracket.
Balch explained that the Whi<c\
House «nd Washington officials havo
recognized the advantage of build
ing up a steady flow of leadership
and trained personnel from the na
j tion's colleges.
He said students would rontrib
ute the utmost to the national
| welfare by finishing college before,
entering military service.
After completion of college work,
! students are still subject to military
. : service under the present law, h*
jadded.
Balch said the best way to fulijH
. ! the obligations for training and still
complete a college education is foi
I students to enter one of the ROTC
| programs. These include ROTC,
; NROTC, and AROTC.
Students in reserve programs
are also subject to military duty
upon the completion of their col
lege education, he said, although
all graduates in reserve programs
have not been called. But when
and if called, KOTC students
would enter the service as com
missioned officers.
The regulation signed by Presi
dent Truman Saturday is law and is ,
as binding as a law passed by Con- j
gress. A new law could raise or
lower the academic standards lor
deferment, with only the President's
signature. This possibility points up
another advantage belonging to a
reserve program for deferment, |
Balch indicated.
After the three tests this year, no
more tests will be given to college i
students currently enrolled, Balch
said.
All future tests will be given only
to high school seniors before they
enter college. When the present
freshman class finishes college in
1954, Balch said, all college students
after that time will be either:
1. High school students who
passed the Selective Service
aptitude test just before en
tering college; or
2. Students under KOTC pro
grams; or
.1. Members of the armed forces
attending college under gov
ernment orders; or ,
4. Veterans, 4-F's, men over 2fi,
and other draft-ineligiblcs.
Balch said the draft setup at pros- |
ent calls for students to petition
their home draft boards for an op- j
portunity to take the aptitude test, j
This program is hardly feasible, I
Balch commented, and before April j
12 he said he expected Selective !
Service to turn this job over to the [
testing areas (Stanford will be one).
Balch then indicated that appli- !
cations will be available April 12
for students to petition to take the j
test.

gress. A new law could raise or
lower the academic standards lor
deferment, with only the President's
signature. This possibility points up
another advantage belonging to a
reserve program for deferment, |
Balch indicated.
After the three tests this year, no
more tests will be given to college i
students currently enrolled, Balch
said.
All future tests will be given only
to high school seniors before they
enter college. When the present
freshman class finishes college in
1954, Balch said, all college students
after that time will be either:
1. High school students who
passed the Selective Service
aptitude test just before en
tering college; or
2. Students under KOTC pro
grams; or
.1. Members of the armed forces
attending college under gov
ernment orders; or ,
4. Veterans, 4-F's, men over 2fi,
and other draft-ineligiblcs.

This program is hardly feasible, I
Balch commented, and before April j
12 he said he expected Selective !

The college student deferment bill signed by President Truman
Saturday bears further investigation—if students are to take full
advantage of the opportunities offered them.
The law provides for the deferment of college students who
make a grade of 70 on an aptitude test, or deferment of freshmen

in the upper half of their class,
sophomores in the upper two-thirds,
juniors in the upper three-fourths,
and seniors in the upper half.
Richard Balch, chief counselor for
men, pointed out that a passing
grade on the aptitude test (70 for «11
students except seniors entering
graduate work, 75 for them) is more
reliable grounds for deferment than
class standing.
In support of this claim, Balch
explained:
"As a student moves into each
successive year of his college edu
ration, his cla*s standing will be,
re-evaluated.
'"If a student once drops below
the dividing line which gives him
deferment, his deferment is can
celed automatically."
The situation works like this: A
freshman is eligible for deferment
if he is in the upper half of his clasr..
When that half of the class move#
into the sophomore bracket, the up
per two-thirds is eligible for de
ferment.
This means that one-third of th*
freshman class which becomes soph
omores will automatically become
subject to the draft.
When two-thirds of the sopho
more class moves into the junior
bracket, another one-fourth will In
draft - eligible. When what's left
gains senior standing, another half
will be subject to the draft.
If you work it nut mathemati-
I cally—assuming every student re
fused to take the aptitude test —
approximately seven out of ever;,
eight freshmen would become
draft-eligible at some time dm -
| ing the four-year co-liege period.
Only one out of eight would l»«
assured of completing his higher
education.
For this reason Balch recom
mended that all students subject to
the draft take the aptitude test
which will be given on campus May
26, June 16, and June 30. A score of
70 (75 for seniors) entitles students
to deferment until graduation.
Balch also urged students to tak*
the first examination on May 26 to
avoid the possibility of being draft
ed before taking advantage of all
opportunities for deferment.
He said students who fail to
make the prescribed score on the
aptitude test may find themselves
drafted before their class standing
has be#n evaluated by the coun
seling service. This evaluation
work will take up to 30 days to
complete, he said.
To avoid this, Balch urged stu
dents to petition their Jocal draft
boards for 30 days' grace from the
June 17 graduation date at Stanford
In this way men who fail to mak<*
the grade of 70 (75 for seniors plan
ning to enter graduate work) will
have an opportunity for deferment
if they are in the respective clas«
bracket.
Balch explained that the Whi<c\
House «nd Washington officials havo
recognized the advantage of build
ing up a steady flow of leadership
and trained personnel from the na
j tion's colleges.
He said students would rontrib
ute the utmost to the national
| welfare by finishing college before,
entering military service.
After completion of college work,
! students are still subject to military
. : service under the present law, h*
jadded.
Balch said the best way to fulijH
. ! the obligations for training and still
complete a college education is foi
I students to enter one of the ROTC
| programs. These include ROTC,
; NROTC, and AROTC.
Students in reserve programs
are also subject to military duty
upon the completion of their col
lege education, he said, although
all graduates in reserve programs
have not been called. But when

the first examination on May 26 to
avoid the possibility of being draft
ed before taking advantage of all
opportunities for deferment.
He said students who fail to
make the prescribed score on the
aptitude test may find themselves
drafted before their class standing
has be#n evaluated by the coun
seling service. This evaluation
work will take up to 30 days to
complete, he said.
To avoid this, Balch urged stu
dents to petition their Jocal draft
boards for 30 days' grace from the
June 17 graduation date at Stanford
In this way men who fail to mak<*
the grade of 70 (75 for seniors plan
ning to enter graduate work) will
have an opportunity for deferment
if they are in the respective clas«
bracket.
Balch explained that the Whi<c\
House «nd Washington officials havo
recognized the advantage of build
ing up a steady flow of leadership
and trained personnel from the na
j tion's colleges.
He said students would rontrib
ute the utmost to the national
| welfare by finishing college before,
entering military service.
After completion of college work,
! students are still subject to military
. : service under the present law, h*
jadded.
Balch said the best way to fulijH
. ! the obligations for training and still
complete a college education is foi
I students to enter one of the ROTC
| programs. These include ROTC,
; NROTC, and AROTC.
Students in reserve programs
are also subject to military duty
upon the completion of their col
lege education, he said, although
all graduates in reserve programs
have not been called. But when
and if called, KOTC students
would enter the service as com
missioned officers.
The regulation signed by Presi
dent Truman Saturday is law and is ,
as binding as a law passed by Con- j
gress. A new law could raise or
lower the academic standards lor
deferment, with only the President's
signature. This possibility points up
another advantage belonging to a
reserve program for deferment, |
Balch indicated.
After the three tests this year, no
more tests will be given to college i
students currently enrolled, Balch
said.
All future tests will be given only
to high school seniors before they
enter college. When the present
freshman class finishes college in
1954, Balch said, all college students
after that time will be either:
1. High school students who
passed the Selective Service
aptitude test just before en
tering college; or
2. Students under KOTC pro
grams; or
.1. Members of the armed forces
attending college under gov
ernment orders; or ,
4. Veterans, 4-F's, men over 2fi,
and other draft-ineligiblcs.

Balch commented, and before April j
12 he said he expected Selective !
Service to turn this job over to the [
testing areas (Stanford will be one).
Balch then indicated that appli- !
cations will be available April 12
for students to petition to take the j
test.
The college student deferment bill signed by President Truman
Saturday bears further investigation—if students are to take full
advantage of the opportunities offered them.
The law provides for the deferment of college students who
make a grade of 70 on an aptitude test, or deferment of freshmen

in the upper half of their class,
sophomores in the upper two-thirds,
juniors in the upper three-fourths,
and seniors in the upper half.
Richard Balch, chief counselor for
men, pointed out that a passing
grade on the aptitude test (70 for «11
students except seniors entering
graduate work, 75 for them) is more
reliable grounds for deferment than
class standing.
In support of this claim, Balch
explained:
"As a student moves into each
successive year of his college edu
ration, his cla*s standing will be,
re-evaluated.
'"If a student once drops below
the dividing line which gives him
deferment, his deferment is can
celed automatically."
The situation works like this: A
freshman is eligible for deferment
if he is in the upper half of his clasr..
When that half of the class move#
into the sophomore bracket, the up
per two-thirds is eligible for de
ferment.
This means that one-third of th*
freshman class which becomes soph
omores will automatically become
subject to the draft.
When two-thirds of the sopho
more class moves into the junior
bracket, another one-fourth will In
draft - eligible. When what's left
gains senior standing, another half
will be subject to the draft.
If you work it nut mathemati-
I cally—assuming every student re
fused to take the aptitude test —
approximately seven out of ever;,
eight freshmen would become
draft-eligible at some time dm -
| ing the four-year co-liege period.
Only one out of eight would l»«
assured of completing his higher
education.
For this reason Balch recom
mended that all students subject to
the draft take the aptitude test
which will be given on campus May
26, June 16, and June 30. A score of
70 (75 for seniors) entitles students
to deferment until graduation.
Balch also urged students to tak*
the first examination on May 26 to
