## Aptitude tests May 26 Class Standings Are 'Less Reliable' As Deferment Basis, Says Balch 
### 
The college student deferment bill signed by President Truman
Saturday bears further investigation—if students are to take full
advantage of the opportunities offered them.
The law provides for the deferment of college students who
make a grade of 70 on an aptitude test, or deferment of freshmen

in the upper half of their class,
sophomores in the upper two-thirds,
juniors in the upper three-fourths,
and seniors in the upper half.
Richard Balch, chief counselor for
men, pointed out that a passing
grade on the aptitude test (70 for «11
students except seniors entering
graduate work, 75 for them) is more
reliable grounds for deferment than
class standing.
In support of this claim, Balch
explained:
"As a student moves into each
successive year of his college edu
ration, his cla*s standing will be,
re-evaluated.
'"If a student once drops below
the dividing line which gives him
deferment, his deferment is can
celed automatically."
The situation works like this: A
freshman is eligible for deferment
if he is in the upper half of his clasr..
When that half of the class move#
into the sophomore bracket, the up
per two-thirds is eligible for de
ferment.
This means that one-third of th*
freshman class which becomes soph
omores will automatically become
subject to the draft.
When two-thirds of the sopho
more class moves into the junior
bracket, another one-fourth will In
draft - eligible. When what's left
gains senior standing, another half
will be subject to the draft.
If you work it nut mathemati-
I cally—assuming every student re
fused to take the aptitude test —
approximately seven out of ever;,
eight freshmen would become
draft-eligible at some time dm -
| ing the four-year co-liege period.
Only one out of eight would l»«
assured of completing his higher
education.
For this reason Balch recom
mended that all students subject to
the draft take the aptitude test
which will be given on campus May
26, June 16, and June 30. A score of
70 (75 for seniors) entitles students
to deferment until graduation.
Balch also urged students to tak*
the first examination on May 26 to
avoid the possibility of being draft
ed before taking advantage of all
opportunities for deferment.
He said students who fail to
make the prescribed score on the
aptitude test may find themselves
drafted before their class standing
has be#n evaluated by the coun
seling service. This evaluation
work will take up to 30 days to
complete, he said.
To avoid this, Balch urged stu
dents to petition their Jocal draft
boards for 30 days' grace from the
June 17 graduation date at Stanford
In this way men who fail to mak<*
the grade of 70 (75 for seniors plan
ning to enter graduate work) will
have an opportunity for deferment
if they are in the respective clas«
bracket.
Balch explained that the Whi<c\
House «nd Washington officials havo
recognized the advantage of build
ing up a steady flow of leadership
and trained personnel from the na
j tion's colleges.
He said students would rontrib
ute the utmost to the national
| welfare by finishing college before,
entering military service.
After completion of college work,
! students are still subject to military
. : service under the present law, h*
jadded.
Balch said the best way to fulijH
. ! the obligations for training and still
complete a college education is foi
I students to enter one of the ROTC
| programs. These include ROTC,
; NROTC, and AROTC.
