# Why the Rome Debacle?
## 
### 
. For the first time since the issue of the Rome
Peace Congress became an "Excom dilemma"
and representatives started going round and
round on whether or not to send a delegate
from Stanford, the Daily would like to offer a
v/ord of comment.
Now that the issue is "dead" and delegate
Bok has not gone, it is time for us to explain
why the venture, in our opinion, failed so dis
mally.
To begin with, Excom, to our mind, seemed
only half-hearted in its approval of the Rome
Congress and even less enthusiastic after its
almost unanimous approval that Stanford send
a delegate.
The half-heartedness was proven when those
who had supported the Congress so strongly
at its inception virtually "washed their hands
of the whole affair" once it was "settled" and
declined to follow through on the project.
Transportation arrangements —at least in
formation on what transportation could be ob
tained and when and where it could be real
ized on short notice—was needed. All ol this
could have been done long before a delegate
was named. But only hazy, haphazard infor
mation was received.
When it was finally learned that the informa
tion was sorely incomplete, it was practically
dead week, and a couple of student body offi
cials—who had to study for finals—had to step
into the breach and do the best they could.

Their best—because of a time shortage—
wasn't good enough. Money that had been
donated in faithful support of the congress
and what it might do to further the cause of
world peace—was useless.
Moreover, any reputation — good or bad —
that Stanford had gained by being the first
school in the nation to agree to send a delegate,
was made worse by the fact that those who
thought March 14 was NOT TOO LATE TO
SELECT A DELEGATE AND MAKE ALL NEC
ESSARY ARRANGEMENTS, had either not
known, or were too unimpressed with their own
glowing reports of the Congress to make these
arrangements. » <3$
The lesson to be learned from the Rome
debacle seems to us to be one of improper
organization and co-ordination—based on a
decided lack of interest by the whole body.
It is hard to lay the blame on one or two indi
viduals, even though they may be labeled
scapegoats.
Whether the Congress itself was a good idea
or not \yill probably never be known, at least
for many years to come. But handling a project
such as a trip to Rome is very similar to plan
ning a High School Day. If the interest and sup
port are there —and if competent persons are
delegated to do the job—chances are it will get
done.
Excom—and all of us—can learn a lesson or
two from the Rome issue. Next time we may
do better.

The lesson to be learned from the Rome
debacle seems to us to be one of improper
organization and co-ordination—based on a
decided lack of interest by the whole body.
It is hard to lay the blame on one or two indi
viduals, even though they may be labeled
scapegoats.
Whether the Congress itself was a good idea
or not \yill probably never be known, at least
for many years to come. But handling a project
such as a trip to Rome is very similar to plan
ning a High School Day. If the interest and sup
port are there —and if competent persons are
delegated to do the job—chances are it will get
done.
Excom—and all of us—can learn a lesson or
two from the Rome issue. Next time we may
do better.
. For the first time since the issue of the Rome
Peace Congress became an "Excom dilemma"
and representatives started going round and
round on whether or not to send a delegate
from Stanford, the Daily would like to offer a
v/ord of comment.
Now that the issue is "dead" and delegate
Bok has not gone, it is time for us to explain
why the venture, in our opinion, failed so dis
mally.
To begin with, Excom, to our mind, seemed
only half-hearted in its approval of the Rome
Congress and even less enthusiastic after its
almost unanimous approval that Stanford send
a delegate.
The half-heartedness was proven when those
who had supported the Congress so strongly
at its inception virtually "washed their hands
of the whole affair" once it was "settled" and
declined to follow through on the project.
Transportation arrangements —at least in
formation on what transportation could be ob
tained and when and where it could be real
ized on short notice—was needed. All ol this
could have been done long before a delegate
was named. But only hazy, haphazard infor
mation was received.
When it was finally learned that the informa
tion was sorely incomplete, it was practically
dead week, and a couple of student body offi
cials—who had to study for finals—had to step
into the breach and do the best they could.

Their best—because of a time shortage—
wasn't good enough. Money that had been
donated in faithful support of the congress
and what it might do to further the cause of
world peace—was useless.
Moreover, any reputation — good or bad —
that Stanford had gained by being the first
school in the nation to agree to send a delegate,
was made worse by the fact that those who
thought March 14 was NOT TOO LATE TO
SELECT A DELEGATE AND MAKE ALL NEC
ESSARY ARRANGEMENTS, had either not
known, or were too unimpressed with their own
glowing reports of the Congress to make these
arrangements. » <3$
