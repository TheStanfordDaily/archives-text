# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Spring was bounding forth in all its bright, shiny
newness as I woke up yesterday morning. Things
were going to be like things ought to be to be going—
that is, until I reached for my Chronicle sporting
Ereen.
My eyes wandered to the picture in Bill Leiser's
column. Suddenly I did a second take; I rubbed my
eyes. Could this lie! It was early in the morning, but
this certainly wasn't the same Bill Leiser who morning
alter morning sat perched in the picture frame at the
top of his column. This wasn't the same Leiser who
looked knowingly at you a.s you sipped your morning
coffee.
This Leiser sported a schoolboyish, yes, even impish
grin. And adorning his head was a cap with the letters
C-O-A-C-H inscribed on it.
Gads, was Leiser turning in his typewriter? Was he
becoming a sportswriter turned honest? Too bad. We
had always respected Leiser as a writer and sports
analyst of uncommon ability. But a coach? This was
a new line for him. Secretly, we felt sorry for the
school that employed Leiser as coach.
Endeavoring to find out what team it was that he
was going to tutor, we read on. llmmm, Leiser is
going to coach at Stanford. At Stanford?!! At Stan
ford?!! Where the rolling foothills lie? Where Al
Masters reigns supreme? Heavens!! Stajiford!
That's where I go to school. This is the most re
voltin' development since the freshmen won the
Frosh-Soph Jamboree.
Had Chuck Taylor already thrown in the sponge?
Had the former All-American given up before he
started? And how abouV the assistants? Leiser would

probably be given a free rein there. Poor Joe Ruetz,
who just shuffled in from St. Mary's, wouldn't even
get a chance to settle down. Will Connolly, a quick
man with the adjectives, but not a proven journeyman
cach, would probably replace Ruetz as line mentor.
Leiser would also probably bring Art Rosenbaum,
Dick Friendlich, Art Johnson, and Bobby Stevens with
him. Stevens, whose great passion is baseball, would
be dragged away from his beloved Seals to teach Ker
korian and the rest of the quarterbacks to throw.
These are ali adept men on the typewriter, but as
coaches! Ugh! None of them are Paul Brown.
We read on. Hmmm. There were more switches to
make. Leiser is slated to take over in time for the
May 4 intrasquad game, and Chuck Taylor is supposed
to write the game story for the Chronicle. Wait a
minute! As Stanford sports correspondent for the
Chronicle, it's my job to cover the intrasquad game.
Whooz this guy Taylor who is horning in?
Oh well, it should be an interesting game, any
way. I ran to my notebook and marked down the
date, May 4. And then, muttering something about
reg lines be damned, I jumped into bed to sleep it off.
(Actually, I didn't mean any of the intimations about
Mr. Leiser being a poor coach. I just said that to in
ject humor into the column, and I think Bill Leiser
will make an outstanding coach.)
(Disregard the last paragraph. Mr. Leiser is my boss
up at the Chronicle, and I just inserted the last para
graph so I wouldn't be fired.)
(Fortunately, Mr. Leiser is not our boss. Still, the
Daily disclaims any editorial—or publicity—connec
tion with the above, hopes reporter (i rot he will keep
BOTH his jobs.—The Editor.)

alter morning sat perched in the picture frame at the
top of his column. This wasn't the same Leiser who
looked knowingly at you a.s you sipped your morning
coffee.
This Leiser sported a schoolboyish, yes, even impish
grin. And adorning his head was a cap with the letters
C-O-A-C-H inscribed on it.
Gads, was Leiser turning in his typewriter? Was he
becoming a sportswriter turned honest? Too bad. We
had always respected Leiser as a writer and sports
analyst of uncommon ability. But a coach? This was
a new line for him. Secretly, we felt sorry for the
school that employed Leiser as coach.
Endeavoring to find out what team it was that he
was going to tutor, we read on. llmmm, Leiser is
going to coach at Stanford. At Stanford?!! At Stan
ford?!! Where the rolling foothills lie? Where Al
Masters reigns supreme? Heavens!! Stajiford!
That's where I go to school. This is the most re
voltin' development since the freshmen won the
Frosh-Soph Jamboree.
Had Chuck Taylor already thrown in the sponge?
Had the former All-American given up before he
started? And how abouV the assistants? Leiser would

probably be given a free rein there. Poor Joe Ruetz,
who just shuffled in from St. Mary's, wouldn't even
get a chance to settle down. Will Connolly, a quick
man with the adjectives, but not a proven journeyman
cach, would probably replace Ruetz as line mentor.
Leiser would also probably bring Art Rosenbaum,
Dick Friendlich, Art Johnson, and Bobby Stevens with
him. Stevens, whose great passion is baseball, would
be dragged away from his beloved Seals to teach Ker
korian and the rest of the quarterbacks to throw.
These are ali adept men on the typewriter, but as
coaches! Ugh! None of them are Paul Brown.
We read on. Hmmm. There were more switches to
make. Leiser is slated to take over in time for the
May 4 intrasquad game, and Chuck Taylor is supposed
to write the game story for the Chronicle. Wait a
minute! As Stanford sports correspondent for the
Chronicle, it's my job to cover the intrasquad game.
Whooz this guy Taylor who is horning in?
Oh well, it should be an interesting game, any
way. I ran to my notebook and marked down the
date, May 4. And then, muttering something about
reg lines be damned, I jumped into bed to sleep it off.
(Actually, I didn't mean any of the intimations about
Mr. Leiser being a poor coach. I just said that to in
ject humor into the column, and I think Bill Leiser
will make an outstanding coach.)
(Disregard the last paragraph. Mr. Leiser is my boss
up at the Chronicle, and I just inserted the last para
graph so I wouldn't be fired.)
(Fortunately, Mr. Leiser is not our boss. Still, the
Daily disclaims any editorial—or publicity—connec
tion with the above, hopes reporter (i rot he will keep
BOTH his jobs.—The Editor.)
Spring was bounding forth in all its bright, shiny
newness as I woke up yesterday morning. Things
were going to be like things ought to be to be going—
that is, until I reached for my Chronicle sporting
Ereen.
My eyes wandered to the picture in Bill Leiser's
column. Suddenly I did a second take; I rubbed my
eyes. Could this lie! It was early in the morning, but
this certainly wasn't the same Bill Leiser who morning
