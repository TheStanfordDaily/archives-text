## "The Titan' IS Better 
### 
By ROY HEMMING And GEORGE BUCKLEY
As fine and a.s distinguished u use of the movie me
dium as the Guild is offering this week in "The Titan"
j-ives evidence that some movies are better than ever.
"The Titan" presents no living actors, yet creates
an amazingly vivid picture of the life and times of
Michelangelo through his famous works of art.
Robert Flaherty and his American editors have
taken an original, rambling Swiss film and tightened
it into a fascinating dramatic presentation of paintings
and sculpture that have rarely been equalled by any
artist of any age. Frederic March delivers the concise
commentary.
The picture just won an Academy Award as 1950's
liest documentary—an honor justified, but in some
ways almost inadequate. Short of an actual trip to
Florence or Rome, a visit to the Guild this week will
bring you into vivid contact with some of the greatest
art treasures of the western world.
The qualities of "The Titan" stand out especially in
contrast with its companion feature, Charles Laugh
ton's 1936 "Rembrandt." In typical movie fashion, this

one dramatizes what might have been the artist's in
significant private life, conspicuously leaving out of
view the works of art that made him immortal.
(Laughton and Elsa Lanchester still make it entertain
ing, though wanting.)
Up the street at the Park, beginning Thursday, an
other interesting contrast will unfold. Those of you
whose faith in the Valentino legend was shattered
by that teehnicolored horror of a few weeks back,
can see the original Rudolph romping through a re
vival of "Son of the Sheik."
This time the leer, the stance, the old-time passion
are the real stuff. You may laugh in a few places
where you're not supposed to, but you'll get a better
idea of what Mother swooned over than from that
alleged biography.
And for sheer comedy you'll go far before you beat
Harold Lloyd's "Movie Crazy" which the Park has
also brought hack. Some of the scenes drag a little,
but the funny ones predominate and are twice as
funny as those in "Mad Wednesday"—especially his
screen test and his involvement with a magician's
coat. I^augh?—You'll die!
