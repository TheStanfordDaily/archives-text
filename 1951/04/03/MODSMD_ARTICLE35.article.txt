# Golf Clubs 'Borrowed' From Roble
## 
### 
The resemblance between a set of
i gall clubs and a bicycle is purely
' coincidental, but some people
! around these parts have taken to
j "borrowing" golf clubs as well as
I two-wheeled vehicles.
During spring vacation, a Stan
| ford student stopped to vi.sit a friend
|at Koble, leaving his set of golf
j clubs with seven new balls outside
| the Koble door. He returned after
| live minutes and found them gone.
I This was Friday afternoon, March
i 30.
Sunday morning, after two days
of fruitless searching, the student
found that the golf clubs had been
mysteriously returned to Roble. The
set showed evidence of having been
J used and six of the new golf balls
[ were gone.
The only clue to the mysterious
I return of the clubs was a note at
: tached |o the set that said they had
been lound on the Roble lawn. As
for their disappearance, one can as
t sume from the missing balls that the
I "borrower" must have hit over par.
