# PRO AND CAHN
## 
### LARRY 
Stanford's CIBA defending champion baseball team returns to the dia
mond wars this weekend when the Indians, nearly scalped by USC, cross
bats with California on Friday and Santa Clara in a double header Satur
day.
With spring just about in full swing, Sunken Diamon's wooden stands
should be filled for the coming three games. But we are betting our pile of
copy paper that there will be many empty seats. There are no doubt numer
ous reasons for this wager but the chief one seems to be that the National
Pastime is a waste of time. It is just too slow.
We used to argue this point strongly, but even as loyal as we arc, we
must admit certain weaknesses in the present game of baseball. We can't
go along with the consensus of many, especially the fairer sex, that they
can't understand why old men in long, heavy-gauge stockings and funny
pants, should waste their time throwing a ball, hitting it, and then chasing
it, while others are running circles after each other. We do admit that base
ball is slow and ofttimes boring.
Hasehall, a Dull, liorinjj Game
After first seeing Stanford play, following basketball season, we com
mented upon the slowness of the game. Of course, we attributed the feeling
ol boredom to the rapid change in pace from basketball to baseball, and to
the fact that college baseball just isn't as good or fast as the way the play
for-pay boys indulge.
There have been many suggestions for quickening the pace of the game,
but they all seem impossible to press into use at this time. One is to limit
the game by time instead of innings. But the obvious fault is the great deal
of stalling that would develop by the team ahead. Perhaps another plan is
to eliminate between-inning infield warmup as well as the tease tosss be
tween pitcher and catcher. Players argue that these formalities are neces
sary, but to us they seem a tradition; nothing more.
An even more absurd suggestion at this time is to cut down on the number
jf balls and strikes to each batter; for instance, only two strikes and three
balls. At present the only thing that can be sensibly advocated is for the
umpire, who is the head man, to speed up the game as best he can. And
about the only way he can do this is to encourage more hustle among the
players while offensive and defensive changes take place between innings.
Of course, he could enforce some anti-stalling rules, but that would be too
radical.
New York Yankees, a Disappointment
Following a 2 to 6 final, two Fridays ago, we drove up Bayshore and ar
rived at Seals' Stadium in the heart of San Francisco's Mission District, to
watch the local entry in the Pacific Coast League do battle with the legend
ary team of all baseball, the New York Yankees. To us the American League
champions were somewhat of a disappointment.
The Seals rose to the occasion, in fact way above it, and knocked over
the "idols," 18 to 5, before 20,000 awed spectators. However, the Yanks
avenged Sunday by pasting the arrogant San Franciscans, 10 to 2. But even
in winning the Yanks did not look like the same boys who wore the New
York Hannels last season. They were listless, lacked hustle, and appeared to
be resting on their over-fat laurels. The biggest show was batting practice,
in which Yank after Yank hammered balls into the distant 347 ft. and 350 ft.
left- and right-field bleachers. But against Seal pitching they were inept.
Joe DiMaggio, who received a standing ovation from home-town admirers
got only one hit in two games and was not impressive in his customary
'.•enterfield spot. As far as the other World Champs go, they just looked like
ordinary ball players in heroes uniforms.
In all respect we recognize the fact that "old pros" such as the Yankees
take their time about getting into shape for the Major League season which
doesn't open until April l(j. Moreover, the opposition wasn't one to inspire
championship, all-out type of play.
Incidentally, if you think the Stanford nine has troubles after losing their
opening two conference games, think of the S.F. Seals, who have dropped
their first seven straight.

With spring just about in full swing, Sunken Diamon's wooden stands
should be filled for the coming three games. But we are betting our pile of
copy paper that there will be many empty seats. There are no doubt numer
ous reasons for this wager but the chief one seems to be that the National
Pastime is a waste of time. It is just too slow.
We used to argue this point strongly, but even as loyal as we arc, we
must admit certain weaknesses in the present game of baseball. We can't
go along with the consensus of many, especially the fairer sex, that they
can't understand why old men in long, heavy-gauge stockings and funny
pants, should waste their time throwing a ball, hitting it, and then chasing
it, while others are running circles after each other. We do admit that base
ball is slow and ofttimes boring.
Hasehall, a Dull, liorinjj Game
After first seeing Stanford play, following basketball season, we com
mented upon the slowness of the game. Of course, we attributed the feeling
ol boredom to the rapid change in pace from basketball to baseball, and to
the fact that college baseball just isn't as good or fast as the way the play
for-pay boys indulge.
There have been many suggestions for quickening the pace of the game,
but they all seem impossible to press into use at this time. One is to limit
the game by time instead of innings. But the obvious fault is the great deal
of stalling that would develop by the team ahead. Perhaps another plan is
to eliminate between-inning infield warmup as well as the tease tosss be
tween pitcher and catcher. Players argue that these formalities are neces
sary, but to us they seem a tradition; nothing more.
An even more absurd suggestion at this time is to cut down on the number
jf balls and strikes to each batter; for instance, only two strikes and three
balls. At present the only thing that can be sensibly advocated is for the
umpire, who is the head man, to speed up the game as best he can. And
about the only way he can do this is to encourage more hustle among the
players while offensive and defensive changes take place between innings.
Of course, he could enforce some anti-stalling rules, but that would be too
radical.
New York Yankees, a Disappointment
Following a 2 to 6 final, two Fridays ago, we drove up Bayshore and ar
rived at Seals' Stadium in the heart of San Francisco's Mission District, to
watch the local entry in the Pacific Coast League do battle with the legend
ary team of all baseball, the New York Yankees. To us the American League
champions were somewhat of a disappointment.
The Seals rose to the occasion, in fact way above it, and knocked over
the "idols," 18 to 5, before 20,000 awed spectators. However, the Yanks
avenged Sunday by pasting the arrogant San Franciscans, 10 to 2. But even
in winning the Yanks did not look like the same boys who wore the New
York Hannels last season. They were listless, lacked hustle, and appeared to
be resting on their over-fat laurels. The biggest show was batting practice,
in which Yank after Yank hammered balls into the distant 347 ft. and 350 ft.
left- and right-field bleachers. But against Seal pitching they were inept.
Joe DiMaggio, who received a standing ovation from home-town admirers
got only one hit in two games and was not impressive in his customary
'.•enterfield spot. As far as the other World Champs go, they just looked like
ordinary ball players in heroes uniforms.
In all respect we recognize the fact that "old pros" such as the Yankees
take their time about getting into shape for the Major League season which
doesn't open until April l(j. Moreover, the opposition wasn't one to inspire
championship, all-out type of play.
