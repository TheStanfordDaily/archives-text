## Track Team To Vie at UCLA SHUFFLING THE CARDS 
### 
Stanford's cinder stock took a big
rise yesterday when it was learned
that Bob Bryan, star low hurdler,
will in all probability be ready to
run against the UCLA Bruins at
Westwood Saturday.
Bryan, who dropped out of the
low hurdle race at Fresno with a
pulled muscle, was feared to be out
of action for at least a week. For
tunately the injury was slight, and
the Card ace is expected to run this
weekend.
Darrell Kreitz, number one high
hurdler, and Ronnie Buck, speedy
.sprinter, are expected to return to
action after a week's absence.
Bob Maihias, who scored 13 points
against Fresno last weekend, will
probably enter only two events in
the Bruin meet —the shot put and
'liscus.
Mathias will bypass the high hur
dles again this Saturday, so as not
to aggravate a slight back injury,
but may run the high barriers later
in the season.
Low hurdler Jim Pollock, who
has been bothered with a knot in
Ms leg, is also expected to help the
Indian cause when he returns to
action in Los Angeles Saturday.
As it stands now, there are no
serious injuries on the team, and the
Cards will meet the Bruins Satur
day at full strength.
