# Yardley, Stewart Chevrolet Ace, Stars In AAU Tournament Win
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN Daily Sports Editor 
Local fans have known it ior quite
a while, but last month's national
AAU basketball tournament in Den
ver proved the fact to all of the na
tion's sporting population.
George Yardley is one of the all
time cage greats of the United
States.
The Blond Bomber from Balboa
was the whole show in the Mile
High City festival as he led the
Sttwart Chevrolets to their first na
tional title and etched his name be
sic e those of Hank Luisetti and Jim
Pollard in that section of basket
ball's hall of fame reserved for
Stanford magnificents.
He accomplished the feat by (1)
averaging better than 22 points per
game in the Chevvies' five tourney
outings, (2) outplaying and outscor
ing legendary Bob Kurland in the
Stewarts' hair - raising triple-over
time semi-final win over defending
champion Phillips Oilers, (3) setting
a new tourney mark by bucketing
32 points in the final game against
Colorado A&M's Cinderella Five,
known officially as the Poudre Val
ley Creamery, and (4) augmenting
his scoring efforts with a rebound
ing and defensive excellence that
drew a ralter-shaking ovation from
the highly partisan Colorado crowd.
The Denver press, likewise un
derstandably biased in favor of the
local unknowns who had become
the first unseeded team to reach the
finals in 20 years, were nevertheless

unable to contain their superlatives
in describing George's perform

ances.
Chet Nelson, sports editor of the
Rocky Mountain News, wrote:
"The magnificent George Yard
ley, former Stanford University
ate, personally escorted his mates
into the throne room and firmly
carved his name in the all-time
honor roll of AAU basketball.
"There isn t much this 6-foot,
6-inch poker face can't do. It
wasn't only his twisting, driving
shots, his deft one-handed lofts,
his tip-ins that endeared him to
the deathlv partisan crowd. He
swept the backboards and played
a glove-tight defensive game."
Frank Haraway, Denver Post
sports editor, had this to say con
cerning Yardley's final-game play:
"The limber - legged Stanford
product did everything but mop
the floor between halves and did
it with such ease that he hardly
seemed to be trying."
And when it was all over, the j
sportswriters made it official by !
naming Jumpin' Jorge a unanimous
choice on the Ail-American team.
