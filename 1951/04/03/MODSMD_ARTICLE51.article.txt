# New Booklet Tells Of Germ Warfare
## 
### 
The federal government took the
terror out of germ warfare in an
official booklet received by the State
Office of Civilian Defense, caution- i
ing that common sense cleanliness
is the best protection.
That is not to say, the pamphlet
points out, the nation has nothing to
fear from biological warfare. But
the danger is from new ways of i
spreading disease — not new and
mysterious germs.
