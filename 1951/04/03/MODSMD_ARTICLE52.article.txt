# Stanford 'Flu' Isn't Flu-- Those Were 'Bad Colds'
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
'"Quick, Henry, the Rest Home.
You've got the flu."
With the long list of names re
( corded in Rest Home roll books at
the end of last quarter, Stanford
students are tagging the flu bug
with the blame.
According to student opinion, ev
ery case of nausea, headache, dizzi
! ness, and general cold symptoms is
the flu. But, according to Dr. George
H. Houck of the Stanford Health
] Service, there were only two cases
i of proved flu at Stanford last quar-
I tcr.
No Epidemic
The Rest Homes were filled bc
| cause the expected secondary peak
of colds, which usually arrives dur
ing the first week in January, was
two weeks late last quarter. In oth
er words, the "epidemic" consisted
of a conglomeration of the common
cold, grippe, and a number of other
respiratory diseases which all re
semble the flu.
Flu is a virus, a large non-living
chemical molecule which has the
power to reproduce. There is only
one way to diagnose the illness it
causes. A blood test is taken from
a sick patient. Two weeks later, an
other test is taken from the same
patient.
Blood Test Tells
From the amount and type of an
tibodies in the blood, the physician
can tell whether or not the patient
actually had the flu.
The physician must start his diag
nosis by calling the illness "an acute
respiratory condition" and work
from there.
Vaccines for producing artificial
| immunity to the flu have been de
j veloped. They produce a fairly high

degree of immunity within a two
week period. The efTcct lasts for
five to 10 months.
Vaccine Difficulties
However, there is danger in giv
ing the vaccine to a person sensitive
to egg protein, as the virus is grown
in hen's eggs.
The viruses are divided into A
and B types, but each group in
cludes so many varieties of the
virus that immunization to all is
difficult.
No one knows exactly how many
flu viruses there are. Many exist,
and each can vary in appearance
over a period of time.
Stanford had its own troubles
with vaccination in 1948 and 1940.
Students were vaccinated in the
fall. Between the time of vaccina
tion and Christmas vacation, a new
type of the virus (the FMI), was
isolated at an Army camp in Fort
Monmouth, New Jersey. It was not
included in the Stanford vaccine.
Not Virus X
During vacation a type of flu
called virus X. but really FM 1, was
going around Los Angeles, where a
large number of the vaccinated stu
dents live.
Dr. Houck and his associates ob
tained the FM 1 vaccine and pretty
nearly served as a welcoming com
mittee as this group of students re
turned to campus.
Partly as a result of this experi
ence the Health Service has decider!
lo give up the routine commercial
vaccine until they know an epidem
ic is on the way, they know the ex
act virus involved, and they have
available a good vaccine containing
the virus.

Currently, the incidence of respi
ratory infection is not high within
the student body, said Dr. Ilouck. It
is not more than the expected
amount, and is steadily decreasing.
Mass flu vaccination is not now ad
vised.
Flu can be transmitted only
through infected persons. Public
health authorities say there is little
likelihood of Europe's current influ
enza epidemic spreading to the
United States as a major epidemic.
Localized epidemics appear in the
United States every year at this
season, but only occasionally do
these become widespread.
Pandemic Overdue
Studies made during the last hun
dred years point to the occurrence
of world-wide pandemics (super
epidemics) about three times a cen
tury. The last one was in 1918, and
one is long overdue.
The recent localized epidemics
have had none of the characteris
tics of the 1918 epidemic.
There is an elaborate spy system
of virus laboratories all over the
world watching the progress of in
fluenza and other virus infections.
Blood specimens are exchanged in
all parts of the world to keep tabs

| on viruses in every community.
If an epidemic is on the way this
spy network will be able to catch
it in the early stages, and using
techniques developed since the 1918
epidemic, isolate the particular vi
rus, prepare a vaccine, and prevent
unnecessary loss of life.

the flu. But, according to Dr. George
H. Houck of the Stanford Health
] Service, there were only two cases
i of proved flu at Stanford last quar-
I tcr.
No Epidemic
The Rest Homes were filled bc
| cause the expected secondary peak
of colds, which usually arrives dur
ing the first week in January, was
two weeks late last quarter. In oth
er words, the "epidemic" consisted
of a conglomeration of the common
cold, grippe, and a number of other
respiratory diseases which all re
semble the flu.
Flu is a virus, a large non-living
chemical molecule which has the
power to reproduce. There is only
one way to diagnose the illness it
causes. A blood test is taken from
a sick patient. Two weeks later, an
other test is taken from the same
patient.
Blood Test Tells
From the amount and type of an
tibodies in the blood, the physician
can tell whether or not the patient
actually had the flu.
The physician must start his diag
nosis by calling the illness "an acute
respiratory condition" and work
from there.
Vaccines for producing artificial
| immunity to the flu have been de
j veloped. They produce a fairly high

degree of immunity within a two
week period. The efTcct lasts for
five to 10 months.
Vaccine Difficulties
However, there is danger in giv
ing the vaccine to a person sensitive
to egg protein, as the virus is grown
in hen's eggs.
The viruses are divided into A
and B types, but each group in
cludes so many varieties of the
virus that immunization to all is
difficult.
No one knows exactly how many
flu viruses there are. Many exist,
and each can vary in appearance
over a period of time.
Stanford had its own troubles
with vaccination in 1948 and 1940.
Students were vaccinated in the
fall. Between the time of vaccina
tion and Christmas vacation, a new
type of the virus (the FMI), was
isolated at an Army camp in Fort
Monmouth, New Jersey. It was not
included in the Stanford vaccine.
Not Virus X
During vacation a type of flu
called virus X. but really FM 1, was
going around Los Angeles, where a
large number of the vaccinated stu
dents live.
Dr. Houck and his associates ob
tained the FM 1 vaccine and pretty
nearly served as a welcoming com
mittee as this group of students re
turned to campus.
Partly as a result of this experi
ence the Health Service has decider!
lo give up the routine commercial
vaccine until they know an epidem
ic is on the way, they know the ex
act virus involved, and they have
available a good vaccine containing
the virus.

Currently, the incidence of respi
ratory infection is not high within
the student body, said Dr. Ilouck. It
is not more than the expected
amount, and is steadily decreasing.
Mass flu vaccination is not now ad
vised.
Flu can be transmitted only
through infected persons. Public
health authorities say there is little
likelihood of Europe's current influ
enza epidemic spreading to the
United States as a major epidemic.
Localized epidemics appear in the
United States every year at this
season, but only occasionally do
these become widespread.
Pandemic Overdue
Studies made during the last hun
dred years point to the occurrence
of world-wide pandemics (super
epidemics) about three times a cen
tury. The last one was in 1918, and
one is long overdue.
The recent localized epidemics
have had none of the characteris
tics of the 1918 epidemic.
There is an elaborate spy system
of virus laboratories all over the
world watching the progress of in
fluenza and other virus infections.
Blood specimens are exchanged in
all parts of the world to keep tabs

| on viruses in every community.
If an epidemic is on the way this
spy network will be able to catch
it in the early stages, and using
techniques developed since the 1918
epidemic, isolate the particular vi
rus, prepare a vaccine, and prevent
unnecessary loss of life.

er words, the "epidemic" consisted
of a conglomeration of the common
cold, grippe, and a number of other
respiratory diseases which all re
semble the flu.
Flu is a virus, a large non-living
chemical molecule which has the
power to reproduce. There is only
one way to diagnose the illness it
causes. A blood test is taken from
a sick patient. Two weeks later, an
other test is taken from the same
patient.
Blood Test Tells
From the amount and type of an
tibodies in the blood, the physician
can tell whether or not the patient
actually had the flu.
The physician must start his diag
nosis by calling the illness "an acute
respiratory condition" and work
from there.
Vaccines for producing artificial
| immunity to the flu have been de
j veloped. They produce a fairly high

degree of immunity within a two
week period. The efTcct lasts for
five to 10 months.
Vaccine Difficulties
However, there is danger in giv
ing the vaccine to a person sensitive
to egg protein, as the virus is grown
in hen's eggs.
The viruses are divided into A
and B types, but each group in
cludes so many varieties of the
virus that immunization to all is
difficult.
No one knows exactly how many
flu viruses there are. Many exist,
and each can vary in appearance
over a period of time.
Stanford had its own troubles
with vaccination in 1948 and 1940.
Students were vaccinated in the
fall. Between the time of vaccina
tion and Christmas vacation, a new
type of the virus (the FMI), was
isolated at an Army camp in Fort
Monmouth, New Jersey. It was not
included in the Stanford vaccine.
Not Virus X
During vacation a type of flu
called virus X. but really FM 1, was
going around Los Angeles, where a
large number of the vaccinated stu
dents live.
Dr. Houck and his associates ob
tained the FM 1 vaccine and pretty
nearly served as a welcoming com
mittee as this group of students re
turned to campus.
Partly as a result of this experi
ence the Health Service has decider!
lo give up the routine commercial
vaccine until they know an epidem
ic is on the way, they know the ex
act virus involved, and they have
available a good vaccine containing
the virus.

Currently, the incidence of respi
ratory infection is not high within
the student body, said Dr. Ilouck. It
is not more than the expected
amount, and is steadily decreasing.
Mass flu vaccination is not now ad
vised.
Flu can be transmitted only
through infected persons. Public
health authorities say there is little
likelihood of Europe's current influ
enza epidemic spreading to the
United States as a major epidemic.
Localized epidemics appear in the
United States every year at this
season, but only occasionally do
these become widespread.
Pandemic Overdue
Studies made during the last hun
dred years point to the occurrence
of world-wide pandemics (super
epidemics) about three times a cen
tury. The last one was in 1918, and
one is long overdue.
The recent localized epidemics
have had none of the characteris
tics of the 1918 epidemic.
There is an elaborate spy system
of virus laboratories all over the
world watching the progress of in
fluenza and other virus infections.
Blood specimens are exchanged in
all parts of the world to keep tabs

| on viruses in every community.
If an epidemic is on the way this
spy network will be able to catch
it in the early stages, and using
techniques developed since the 1918
epidemic, isolate the particular vi
rus, prepare a vaccine, and prevent
unnecessary loss of life.
