"The Closing of the Public Do
main" by Dr. E. Louise Peffer, econ
omist at the Stanford Research In
stitute. has just been issued by the
University Press.
Dr. Peffer traces the development
of new public domain policy from
two laws. In 1897 Congress passed
a law for administration and use of
forest reserves, closing these areas
of the domain to entry and settle
ment.
This was followed by the Recla
mation Act of 1902 which provided
for irrigation of subhumid lands of
the West in the interest of promot
ing settlement.
