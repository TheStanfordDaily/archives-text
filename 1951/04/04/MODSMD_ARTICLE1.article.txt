TOKVO. Wednesday, April UUP)
American troops in force drove
more than three miles into North
Korea on a 10-mile front yesterday
and unleashed a mighty artillery
barrage today on Chinese Commu
nists racing to head them off.
The tank - led American Cil's
swarmed across the 38th parallel
above Seoul as Gen. Douglas Mae-
Arthur jeeped 15 miles into North
Korea at the other end of the line
for a front-line visit to South Ko
rean battle stations.
At the extreme western end of the
battle front, Chinese and North Ko
reans opened heavy counterattacks
on South Korean forces and forced
them hack across the Imjin River,
although Allied artillery and air
strikes caught the Reds in the open
and took a heavy toll.
