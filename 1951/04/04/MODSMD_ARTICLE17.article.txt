# TUESDAY SERIES
## Dr. Newell, Paly Mayor Talk on CD 
### 
Two talks about a possible atomic
attack in the Bay Area opened the
spring quarter Tuesday Evening Se
ries last night, in Memorial Hall.
Mayor Walter Caspar of Palo Alto
and Dr. Robert Rcid Newell dis
cussed several phases of civil de
fense and individual protection
against, an atomic disaster.
Dr. Newell, the main speaker of
the evening and a Stanford profes
sor of medicine, summarized the
specific dangers to the individual
citizen. There is no effective de
fense, lie warned, "no military,
physical, medical, chemical" pro
tection which can either stave off
the bomb itself or satisfactorily
eliminate its deadly effects.
Heat rays and the blast, itself will
account for most of the deaths and
severe casualties, he went on. The
highly publicized gamma rays were
responsible for only from 10 to 15
per cent of the Hiroshima fatalities.
Along with the beta rays, which are
just as deadly once they have en
tered the body, they are not a great
problem if thr bomb bursts in the
air.
Far more serious is the explosion
of an A-bomb under water, with a
subsequent radioactive rain. "One
million tons of water would go up
as steam and fall as rain," full of the
products of the fission. This would
be "enormously dangerous," Dr.
Newell emphasized.
Citizens of San Francisco, if they
are planning to. leave the city,
should do so at once, Dr. Newell
advised, in order to enable those
who are going to stay to fight the
inevitable large numbers of fires
and to help take care of the wound
ed efficiently.
Mayor Caspar gave a brief out
line of Palo Alto's position in the
State Civil Defense plan, urging in
creased interact, in t!ic local or
ganizations.
Alf Braudin, head of Stanford's
Civil Defense Program, gave a short
analysis of the University's "trial
runs" last, quarter and the indoc
trination and first aid programs
scheduled for this quarter.
