# 'Aptitude or Grades?' Draft Eligibles Inquire
## Truman Attempts to Define College Students' Standings 
### 
An announcement Monday by the Selective Service office in
Washington. D.C., has put Joe College right back in the same old
quandary. How does he stand in the draft?
That s a question Joe has been trying to get answered for hmi
ever since the present emergency began in the summer of 1950.

Fhe Selective Service announce
ment concerned the new executive
order signed by President Truman
last Saturday.
Not Just Aptitude
The announcement said that the
aptitude scores alone would not
qualify students for occupational
deferment, but aptitude scores plus
the students' class standing, as in
terpreted by the local draft boards,
would determine occupational de
ferment as students.
This announcement again raises
all the problems of the past which
have kept Joe College stewing in an
alphabetical soup of draft classifica
tions.
Students have found themselves
classified 1-A's, l-A-P's, and 2-A's,
at the whim of individual draft
boards. Some boards refused to in
terpret. past Selective Service direc
tives <v> deferring students at all.
The new regulation signed by the
President, which is an executive
order with full force of law, was
expected to eliminate the discrep
ancies in interpretation between in
dividual draft, boards.
70 Passing Score
The regulation provided for occu
pational deferment for students who
passed an aptitude test with a score
of 70 (75 for seniors or graduates) or
deferment of freshmen in the upper
half of their class, sophomores in the
upper two-thirds, juniors in the up
per three-fourths, and seniors in the
upper half.
The important word in the state
ment is OR. It means that by pass
ing the aptitude test OR by being
in the upper bracket in scholastic
class standing a student may qual
ify for deferment until the comple
tion of his education.
What It Will Do
This executive order was expect
ed to do several things.
1. It was exported to let stu
dents know where they stood in
relation to the draft and in rela
tion to the national defense pro
gram.
2. It was expected to stabilize
the over-all draft situation in re
gard to students hy making defi
nite the number of men from col
leges who will he available for
military service when and as
needed.
.'5. It was expected to stabilize the
manpower situation in relation to
students by permitting the gov
ernment to plan effectively for the
utilization of college-trained man
power and brainpower over a pe
riod up to .'lO years.
If local boards are allowed to in
terpret the presidential regulation
as they see fit, the government can
not. know from one year to the next
the nature and amount of manpow
er they can expect from tire nation's
colleges.
The basic problem still remains,
what is Joe College going to do?
Batch States
Cliief Counselor for Men Richard
Balch said he did not think the Se
lective Service announcement was
an accurate statement of the content
of the President's executive order.
He advised all Stanford draft-eli
gibles to apply immediately to their
local boards to take the aptitude test
which will be given on campus May
June 16, and June 30.
He recommended that students
lake the first, test.
Application to take the test will
have to be made by the individual
students, he said, and should be
made by letter to the local draft
board.
Asks Clarification
Balch sent an air mail letter yes
terday to Francis J. Brown in
Washington. D.C., asking for clarifi
cation of Monday's Selective Serv
ice announcement.
Rrown is Washington representa
tive for the American Council on
Education.
Balch said he expected an answer
in a few days.
A copy of the presidential regula
tion shou'd reach the campus in the
next few days.
