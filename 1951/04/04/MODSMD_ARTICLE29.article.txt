# Dr. Sterling and Athletics

### 
How many of us read President Wallace
Sterling's very provocative "From the Inner
Quad" column in last month's Alumni Review?
Therein, Stanford's head man takes a close
look at college iootball, tells his audience that
"proselytizinq and subsidizinq ol players has
become rampant," and repeats his oft-uttered
statement that "it is almost farcical to state that
inteicolleqiate athletics build character."
Our President goes even further. Beaming
his pronouncement to the all-important alumni
arm of the Stanford Family, he writes:
"Something more than lip service must be
rendered to the proposition that colleges and
universities are primarily educational institu
tions in which athletics are valuable but essen
tially extracurricular activities.
"This means that no student participating in
collegiate athletics should enjoy any academic
advantage or special academic privilege: Any
university which permits any such special priv
ilege is culpable and delinguent. It means also
that the public in general and university alumni
in particular must recognize that insofar as they
encourage a student athlete to sell his services
to the highest money bidder they are contrib
uting to the malaise which has produced
"fixed" games.
"There are honest jobs and leqitimate
scholarships available to needy student ath
letes by means ol which they can do much in
tinancinq their hiqher education. These
should suffice . .

We all know what Dr. Sterling means. Still,
he did not go far enough for one San Francisco
sports editor. That writer asked Dr. Sterling
what he called a "natural guestion," namely:
"Do you contemplate any changes in Stanford's
athletic policy?"
We would call the guestion a "natural" one.
If a university president doesn't like his ath
letic setup, it's logical to assume he would use
his power and influence to do something about
it.
However, without havinq talked to Dr.
Sterlinq on the athletic issue, we would say
chances are he himself will do little to chanqe
the Stanford scheme of thinqs.
Quite simply, it is something very close to
bankruptcy for one school in a conference as
large and powerful as the PCC to revise its ath
letic setup without the co-operation and whole
hearted support of its sister schools.
We know that football provides most of the
revenue upon which our Athletic Department
depends. Right now, the SAB is faced with the
problem of paring $32,000 in expenses from
next year's athletic budget to come out even.
If we're going to make enough money to sup
port athletics next year, a big slice of that
money v/ill have to come from football. And

if we aren't on a competing level with other
conference schools, the money—as past expe
rience shows —just won't be there.
That's why the revitalizinq has to be done
on the conference level, and why Dr. Ster
linq —as a sinqle entity from one school—can
do little to revise somethinq that needs re
vision on a much larqer scale.
Still, the sooner the revision comes, the
sooner we're going to have enough money to
finance crew, sailing, skiing, and all the other
college sports that, in the aggregate, attract
many more enthusiasts than football, while of
fering just as much in the way of character
building, enjoyment, and extra-curricular ac
tivity.
One of the ways to achieve the reorganiza
tion is through the influencing of alumni and
friends of PCC schools —those who have much
to say about where the money goes and where
it comes from.
We have learned that members of the Stan
ford "Buck-of-the-Month Club" (not necessarily
Stanford alumni) contribute yearly donations
that go entirely for football scholarships. This
is a fine idea, but if reorganization were brought
about and these members of the Stanford Fam
ily started thinking and donating in terms of
"Stanford Athletics"—not just "Stanford Foot
ball"—some of their money might go to the
other sports besides football that need it so des
perately.
And the Stanford Athletic Board miqht not
have to sweat so when it comes time to bal
ance the budqet!

Last week, over at Cal, a panel made up of
faculty members, Coach Lynn Waldorf, stu
dents, and San Francisco sportswriters came to
the general conclusion that as long as the pri
mary function of a university—education—is
placed above athletics, college sports will con
tinue to be worthwhile.
"Pappy" himself said that athletes should
enter the university on the same basis as other
entering students and maintain the same aca
demic standards while competing in athletics.
It all this is not just "lip service" and we
can assume there are other PCC schools that
feel the same way. a meetinq of faculty, ath
letics, and alumni directors of PCC schools
seems in order.
In his Alumni Review piece, Dr. Sterling
seems to be attempting to lay the groundwork
for such a conference. He presents the alums
with a set of thought-provoking facts and opin
ions—then asks them to think it over.
The Daily seconds this very worthwhile un
dertaking and offers President Sterling its con
tinued support.
