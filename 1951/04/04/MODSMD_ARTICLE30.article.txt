## The
						Evils of Misquoting 
### 
To the Editor:
Jn the Daily of March 9, two students discuss Prof.
Cordon Ferris' remarks given at the forum on inter
national organization. In their letter they have Dr.
Ferris justifying the "might makes l ight" doctrine and
recommending that "when someone comes up with an
idea that does not agree with ours, we must 'club him
down and beat his brains in' until he sees the light."
l)r. Ferris did not say this. He did use a phrase
which. I suppose, his two critics dimly recalled when
they wrote. He was speaking of the threats to man
kind which have come, now and then, from would
be world tyrants—Genghis, Hitler, and perhaps a
contemporary counterpart. He said, of the pests, "I
know of no recourse except to hal their ears hack
until they behave."

Dr. Ferris is not in need of a defender. I am not con
cerned with the impression of the letter upon those
who attended the forum; they are aware that the
meaning of Dr. F'erris' remarks was twisted to fit the
use of opponents of Atlantic Union. I am not an At
lantic Unionist, but I know that it offers no threat to
anyone except international brigands.
I am concerned, however, over the impression which
may well be gathered by those who did not attend the
forum. It is just such misquoting, just such misguided
hostilities toward one or another approach to a single
cause, which leave our people so bewildered and
makes understandable the confusion and defeatism
which prevail. To reverse an old proverb, "When the
righteous quarrel, the devil has his peace."
