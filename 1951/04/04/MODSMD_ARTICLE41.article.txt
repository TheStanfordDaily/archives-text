The record book clearly indicates
that Stanford has had the best of it
in past dual meets with UCLA.
Until 1942 Stanford was undefeated
in track competition with the Bruin.
Alter the Indians resumed ath
letics in 1946, UCLA walked off with
the next three meets. The total rec
ord stands: Stanford, 10 wins; UC
LA, 4. Closest score was the '42
meet, with the Westwooders nip
ping the Cards, 71 to 60. Saturday's
meet should be much closer.
All individual records are held by
Card thinclads except for the hur
dles. In both barriers Craig Dixon
has the top marks. Otis Chandler's
56-ft. %-in. effort in the shot put
and Gay Bryan's 25-ft. 4 :, /4-in. leap
in the broad jump are course rec
ords in Westwood.
