### "DIGGER" ODELL 
THE UCLA TOSSUP

11 past scores mean anything, and
they seldom do, the final score Sat
urday afternoon after the Stanford-
UCLA meet will read something
like this: UCLA, 68; Stanford, 61.
However, according to Coach Jack
Weiershauser of the Indians, with
a live-point difference, anything can
v happen and probably will.
A breakdown of the scores
shows the Curds to be favored in
iht* field events. 111 to 21. If the
torin sheets are correct, Stanford
will sweep the shot put and prob
ably the discus. Lew Davis, Bolt
M Mathias, and Chuck Hokanson
1 will prove too strong an aggre
•jte for the Bruin shot putters,
.id if Mathias, lan Keed. Jack
urke, and Chuck Renfro live up
\ past performances in the discus,
<e Cards should have no trouble
rtere.
Australian Reed, one of the top
discus throwers in the country, has
been suffering from a form of ar
thritis in his knee, but is coming
around rapidly as evidenced by his
157-foot throw at Fresno State last
weekend.
Stanfor 1 in all probability will
also take the high jump, while los
ing in the broad jump, and the jav
elin will be close with UCLA fa
vored by one point.
On the track the Bruins figure
to come out on lop. 47 to 27. How
ever. with the return of Darrell
Kreitz and Ronnie Buck, and if
Bob Bryan and Jim Pollock are
in top shape, the points could be
narrowed.
The Indians are favored to take
the 220 and the high hurdles and the
mile and the are some
thing of a tossup.
At any rate, from the looks of the
dope sheet, this meet promises to be
a heart-stopper for all partisan and
non-partisan observers.

The NCAA swimming champion
ships held last weekend in Austin,
Texas, was another case of the pupil
Seating the teacher. Only this time
it was four pupils.
In the many long years of the
national meet, the University of
Michigan, coached by Matt Mann,
has only once finished below first
or second place and then they
were fourth.
Last week, Michigan met their
swimmers' Waterloo as they fin
ished in twelfth place.
To top it all off, four of the schools
that beat Michigan were coached by
former swimmers for Mann at
Michigan.
Of the four, Charles McCaffree's
Michigan Staters came out on top
with second place, followed by Tom
llaynie of Stanford, who coached
Ills squad into fourth place. Tex
Robertson of (you guessed it) Texas
was fifth, and Dick Papurguth, Pur
due's swim coach, was the last of
the four.
All Mann could say when it was
all over was, "It shows they were

Last week, Michigan met their
swimmers' Waterloo as they fin
ished in twelfth place.
To top it all off, four of the schools
that beat Michigan were coached by
former swimmers for Mann at
Michigan.
Of the four, Charles McCaffree's
Michigan Staters came out on top
with second place, followed by Tom
llaynie of Stanford, who coached
Ills squad into fourth place. Tex
Robertson of (you guessed it) Texas
was fifth, and Dick Papurguth, Pur
due's swim coach, was the last of
the four.
All Mann could say when it was
all over was, "It shows they were
well taught."
THE UCLA TOSSUP

11 past scores mean anything, and
they seldom do, the final score Sat
urday afternoon after the Stanford-
UCLA meet will read something
like this: UCLA, 68; Stanford, 61.
However, according to Coach Jack
Weiershauser of the Indians, with
a live-point difference, anything can
v happen and probably will.
A breakdown of the scores
shows the Curds to be favored in
iht* field events. 111 to 21. If the
torin sheets are correct, Stanford
will sweep the shot put and prob
ably the discus. Lew Davis, Bolt
M Mathias, and Chuck Hokanson
1 will prove too strong an aggre
•jte for the Bruin shot putters,
.id if Mathias, lan Keed. Jack
urke, and Chuck Renfro live up
\ past performances in the discus,
<e Cards should have no trouble
rtere.
Australian Reed, one of the top
discus throwers in the country, has
been suffering from a form of ar
thritis in his knee, but is coming
around rapidly as evidenced by his
157-foot throw at Fresno State last
weekend.
Stanfor 1 in all probability will
also take the high jump, while los
ing in the broad jump, and the jav
elin will be close with UCLA fa
vored by one point.
On the track the Bruins figure
to come out on lop. 47 to 27. How
ever. with the return of Darrell
Kreitz and Ronnie Buck, and if
Bob Bryan and Jim Pollock are
in top shape, the points could be
narrowed.
The Indians are favored to take
the 220 and the high hurdles and the
mile and the are some
thing of a tossup.
At any rate, from the looks of the
dope sheet, this meet promises to be
a heart-stopper for all partisan and
non-partisan observers.
