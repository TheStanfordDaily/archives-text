cause a "severe" tire shortage by
summer.
Testifying before the Senate
Small Business Committee, he
sharply protested an order issued
Monday banning spare tires on new
cars and cutting civilian rubber use
by 5 per cent. Following in an ear
lier 5 per cent. cut. the order will
limit civilian rubber use to about
88.000 tons a month.
Col Iyer, whose firm is one of the
rubber industry's "big four," said
that instead of cutting rubber allo
cations. the government should re
store them at once to 100,000 tons a
month. He also called for a tempo
rary halt to stockpiling of rubber.
