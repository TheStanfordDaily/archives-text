# Cave-Probers Find "Skull" Cavern
## 
### 
During spring vacation the
Stanford Speleological Society
succeeded in rediscovering the
long-lost "Cave of the Skulls" in
the Mother Lode country near
Vallecito.
The story of this cave rocs back a
century to the Gold Rush days of
California. In 1853 a cavern con
taining great numbers of human
skeletons was discovered near Val
lecito. The bones were encrusted
with calcitc and embedded in the
stalagmitie floor of the cavern. Ear
ly visitors named it the "Cave of
the Skulls" and speculated as to the
antiquity and origin of these re
mains.
During the last part of the 1850's
visitors extracted over 65 skulls
from the cave with picks and chis
els, destroyed the formations which
hung from the walls and ceiling,
and permitted a heavy deposit of
earth to bury the original calcitc
floor along with the embedded skel
etons.
The last record of the cave ap
peared in 18(»7 in a report by geolo
gist J. D. Whitney, who found thai
the skeletons were buried too deep
beneath the washed-in earth to en
able him to obtain samples foi
st udy. Since that time, the cave and
its skulls have been forgotten -and
knowledge of its location lost.
Last November, the Stanford cave
explorers undertook research on the
cavern in an effort to discover its
long-forgotten location. One of the
group members, Art Lange, found an
unpublished manuscript nearly 100
years old by Isaac W. Baker, who

had visited the Cave of the Skulls j
in 1853.
Isaac Baker's journal and the ac- |
companying illustrations provided |
the necessary clucs t-> the location
of the cave. Finally, on Easter Sun
day, the Stanford explorers redis
covered the cave, hidden behind
rocks and trees. It fitted the de
scriptions of B;iker and Whitney j
both inside and out.

During spring vacation the
Stanford Speleological Society
succeeded in rediscovering the
long-lost "Cave of the Skulls" in
the Mother Lode country near
Vallecito.
The story of this cave rocs back a
century to the Gold Rush days of
California. In 1853 a cavern con
taining great numbers of human
skeletons was discovered near Val
lecito. The bones were encrusted
with calcitc and embedded in the
stalagmitie floor of the cavern. Ear
ly visitors named it the "Cave of
the Skulls" and speculated as to the
antiquity and origin of these re
mains.
During the last part of the 1850's
visitors extracted over 65 skulls
from the cave with picks and chis
els, destroyed the formations which
hung from the walls and ceiling,
and permitted a heavy deposit of
earth to bury the original calcitc
floor along with the embedded skel
etons.
The last record of the cave ap
peared in 18(»7 in a report by geolo
gist J. D. Whitney, who found thai
the skeletons were buried too deep
beneath the washed-in earth to en
able him to obtain samples foi
st udy. Since that time, the cave and
its skulls have been forgotten -and
knowledge of its location lost.
Last November, the Stanford cave
explorers undertook research on the
cavern in an effort to discover its
long-forgotten location. One of the
group members, Art Lange, found an
unpublished manuscript nearly 100
years old by Isaac W. Baker, who

had visited the Cave of the Skulls j
in 1853.
Isaac Baker's journal and the ac- |
companying illustrations provided |
the necessary clucs t-> the location
of the cave. Finally, on Easter Sun
day, the Stanford explorers redis
covered the cave, hidden behind
rocks and trees. It fitted the de
scriptions of B;iker and Whitney j
both inside and out.
