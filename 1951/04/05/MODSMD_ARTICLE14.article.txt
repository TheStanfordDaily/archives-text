With this theme, the first in a
series of four programs sponsored
by the Senior Vocational Committee
will be presented a week from to
night for the benefit of graduating
seniors.

I Armed Services," "The Financial
j Field," "Business and Government,"
I and "Landing Your Job." The loca
| tion of the sessions is yet undecided.
Vocom chairmen Don Weeden and
j Walt Mcnninger have developed the
j programs, working in conjunction
i with Eugene Dils, director of the
Placement Service.
Not Limited to Seniors
As planned, the scries of Vocom
programs will be aimed toward
those graduating seniors who have
majored in such fields as social
science, English, or history; who
j have thus had no intensified train
j ing for a given job; and who may
or may not have decided on the field
j of activity they wish to enter.
The scries, however, is not limited
j to seniors; and any students, men
| or women, may attend the meetings,
i The first program, "The Armed
Services," will feature an informal
type discussion involving Richard
i Balch, counselor for men; three
1 representatives of the armed scrv
| ices; and Dils.
Topics Listed
On the following Wednesdays, the
second and third programs will each
have three speakers representing
various phases of business. Included
j will be representatives from insur
! ance, banking, investment, mer
j chandising, government, and indus
j try who will advise interested sen
iors about their fields.
The final Vocom session will be
based on "Landing Your Job," with
emphasis placed on the personnel
manager's point of view and the
proper methods of applying for a
