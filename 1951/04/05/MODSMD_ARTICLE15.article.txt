# Trustees To Lease Property
## 
### 
In its first action under the
University's long-pending land
development project, the Board
of Trustees at its last meeting ap
proved two recommendations !
concerning 24 acres of Stanford
land adjoining Menlo Park.
As a result of the Board's author
ization, approximately 16 acres of
Stanford lands lying between Lemon
and Vine streets and bordering San
Francisquito Creek will be developed
into a residental subdivision under a
contract between the University and
the Peninsula Pacific Construction
Company of Menlo Park.
At the same time, the Board agreed i
to a friendly condemnation suit for I
the remaining eight and a half acres
of the tract as a site for a new ele
mentary school.
Condemnation Suit Necessary
The condemnation suit is necessary
for Stanford to be able to sell the
land, since the University's founding I
grant as approved by the state legis
lature prevents Stanford from leasing j
the land for any period longer than :
99 years unless the buyer has the
power of condemnation.
The school board and the Univer
sity will negotiate the price of the j
land within the limits of an official
appraisal of the property's value, I
under which various sections of land ;
were valued at from $3,500 to $4,500 j
per acre.
The Peninsula Pacific Construction
Company, which will lease the 16
acres on a 99-year basis, will pay the
full cash rental in advance. The price j
per acre will he the current market l
price of the land, according to Alf E.
Brandin, Stanford business manager, j
Preference to Stanfordites
The University has asked Harry ,
Arnold, president of the construction j
company and 1927 Farm graduate, to |
give preference to Stanford faculty,
students, and alumni in the residen
tial development.
Engineering problems, filing of
subdivision plans, and other technical
delays will prevent immediate con
struction of homes on the site, Ar
nold said. He estimated that some
homes might be finished before next
winter and he hopes the entire proj
ect will be completed by late 1952.
Koad from Foothills to iVlcnlo Park
Development of this area will per
mit the extension of Searsville Road
to Oak Avenue, offering free access to
Menlo Park from the foothills.
This project, which marks the first
time Stanford lands have been made
available to the public, is part of the
University's land development pro
gram which calls for the eventual use
of about 7,000 acres of undeveloped
property.
Brandin also reported the signing
of a contract with Fairchild Aerial
Surveys Inc. for a topographic survey
of the 8.700-acre campus. The busi
ness manager said it would cost some
$200,000 lo get. such a survey done by
ordinary surveying methods.

99 years unless the buyer has the
power of condemnation.
The school board and the Univer

land within the limits of an official
appraisal of the property's value, I
under which various sections of land ;
were valued at from $3,500 to $4,500 j

The Peninsula Pacific Construction

Preference to Stanfordites
The University has asked Harry ,
Arnold, president of the construction j
company and 1927 Farm graduate, to |
give preference to Stanford faculty,
students, and alumni in the residen
tial development.
Engineering problems, filing of
subdivision plans, and other technical
delays will prevent immediate con
struction of homes on the site, Ar
nold said. He estimated that some
homes might be finished before next
winter and he hopes the entire proj
ect will be completed by late 1952.
Koad from Foothills to iVlcnlo Park
Development of this area will per
mit the extension of Searsville Road
to Oak Avenue, offering free access to
Menlo Park from the foothills.
This project, which marks the first
time Stanford lands have been made
available to the public, is part of the
University's land development pro
gram which calls for the eventual use
of about 7,000 acres of undeveloped
property.
Brandin also reported the signing
of a contract with Fairchild Aerial
Surveys Inc. for a topographic survey
of the 8.700-acre campus. The busi
ness manager said it would cost some
$200,000 lo get. such a survey done by
ordinary surveying methods.
In its first action under the
University's long-pending land
development project, the Board
of Trustees at its last meeting ap
proved two recommendations !
concerning 24 acres of Stanford
land adjoining Menlo Park.
As a result of the Board's author
ization, approximately 16 acres of
Stanford lands lying between Lemon
and Vine streets and bordering San
Francisquito Creek will be developed
into a residental subdivision under a
contract between the University and
the Peninsula Pacific Construction
Company of Menlo Park.
At the same time, the Board agreed i
to a friendly condemnation suit for I
the remaining eight and a half acres
of the tract as a site for a new ele
mentary school.
Condemnation Suit Necessary
The condemnation suit is necessary
for Stanford to be able to sell the
land, since the University's founding I
grant as approved by the state legis
lature prevents Stanford from leasing j
the land for any period longer than :
99 years unless the buyer has the
power of condemnation.
