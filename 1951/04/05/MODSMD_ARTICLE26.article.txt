# Denny Urges Dropping Winter Term Elections
## Rome Issue Mulled Over By Excom 
### 
Excom last night discussed
and then sent to committee a
suggestion that winter quarter
elections be eliminated in an at
tempt to arouse student interest
in the remaining spring and fall
elections.
In other business, the Executive
committee hashed over the Rome
fiasco and also appointed Dick Wei —
mann and Phil Saeta as co-chairmen
of the Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee for next year.
George Denny cited the 13 per cent
turn-out of voters at the polls last
quarter as illustrating the lack of in
terest on the part of candidates,
students, and the Election Board in
fall and winter quarter elections. Ho
believed the students were tired erf
having to vote three times a year.
At, present, candidates for Men's
and Women's Councils vie in tho
winter election, along with any can -
didates for positions vacated sin' «
the previous election. Under Denny's
proposal, two posts for each council
would be filled in the fall and three
in the spring.
Sue Dekker, Union Unit repress- n
tative, inquired as to the possibility
of improving the present system by
looking into the election and cam
paign procedures.
ASSU President Ted Buttner sent
the problem to the Constitution
Committee under Carol Penney,
Women's Row representative, to con
sider all the aspects and report back
to Excom next week. A change in the
number of elections would require a
vote of the student body to amend
the ASSU Constitution.
In other action, Buttner attempted
to explain the reason for the fail n '
of Rome Congress delegate Derek
Bok to make the trip to Rome. He
said the entire project hinged on ac
quiring the student rate from Air
; France, and when the rate v/aa
; granted. Bok had already mado plans
J to meet members of his family for a
birthday celebration.
Buttner said there was just too
short a time to make proper arrangc
j ments.
Daily Editor Rowland Rebele, ex
officio member of Excom, said Excom
"had just not handled the matter
properly and should have organized
further in advance."
Men's Halls representative Phil
Saeta spoke of "indecisiveness" on
the part of Excom in carrying out the
arrangements.
Excom approved the request of Ciil
Jonas, off - campus representative,
that a cablegram be sent to the cur
rent Rome Congress stating that
Stanford's delegate would not be
there.
