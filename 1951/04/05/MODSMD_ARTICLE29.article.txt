# The 						Reg Dance Paradox
## 
### 
Monday night's Reg Dance was a social suc
cess but a financial failure.
The 200 couples who attended were more
than satisfied. The decorations, the band, and
the entertainment combined to make this Reg
Dance one of the best in recent years.
But the eating clubs, who sponsored the
dance in the hope of raising money for their
new building, lost $80.
Not all Reg Dances have followed this pat
tern. 4 Too many in the past have reversed it,
and while the dances have netted nice profits
for the sponsoring groups, they failed to give
the ticket-buyer his money's worth.
Excom has adopted the policy of subsidizing
some all-campus dances in order to encourage
these functions. It has also made it a policy to
award the Reg Dance to an organization in need
of making money.
Experience has shown that the latter policy
tends to lower the quality of the Reg Dances,

and so, in some measure, defeats the purpose
of the former.
The necessity to make money should act as
an incentive for the sponsoring organization to
put on as good a dance as possible so that more
students will be attracted. Unfortunately, how
ever, most people decide to go or not on the
basis of their experience with past Reg Dances,
rather than on a judgment of what this indi
vidual dance may offer.
We are not advocating that Excom undertake
to subsidize the Reg Dances. But we do think
the dances could regain some lost prestige if
the students were guaranteed that each one
would come up to certain standards in the mat
ter of music and decorations.
A situation that tends to penalize those who
provide top-notch dances, while it rewards
those who cut corners even to the point of low
ering quality, needs improvement. The Daily
will welcome any suggestions for such im
provement.—C.H.
