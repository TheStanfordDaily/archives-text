WASHINGTON. April 4 â€” In
formed military sources said tonight
Gen. Douglas Mac-Arthur lias been
authorized to open all-out air at
tacks against Rod airbascs in Man
churia if the Chinese Communists
send their full air power into the
Korean war.
This directive was given to the
United Nations Far Eastern com
mander several weeks ago by the
joint chiefs of staff, it was under
stood. They acted after intelligence
reports located 600 to 800 enemy
warplanes in Manchuria, within
short range of the Korean frontier.
Diplomatic informants said these
instructions do not run counter to
UN aims to confine the war to Ko
rea if possible. The original UN
directive last June authorized Mac-
Arthur to restore peace "in the
general area of Korea."
