Yesterday in the editorial columns we said
that ALL "Buck of the Month Club" money is
turned into football scholarships. That was
how we understood it at the last meeting of the
Stanford Athletic Board.
The statement is not true, according to Don
Liebendorfer and A 1 Masters of the Athletic De
partment.
Actually, our informers tell us, the money is
distributed in the form of full-tuition and part
tuition scholarships to needy members of the
football, track, baseball, swimming, golf, and
tennis teams. Football, because of its impor
tance and large turnouts, receives about one
half to two-thirds of the scholarships.
Another thing: even though the NCAA
dropped its "sanity code" in January, the PCC
has its own brand of "sanity code" that pro
hibits conference schools from giving out any
scholarships that are not strictly of the tuition
variety.
The code also regulates the number of schol
arships each school may offer. Furthermore,
each athlete must live up to the scholastic
standards of his institution before he can even
become eligible for such a scholarship.
The clarifications made yesterday — though
they are most gratifying—serve only to com
plicate a solution to what Dr. Sterling called the
"rampant . . . proselytizing and subsidizing of
players . .

According to Publicity Director Liebendor
fer, the answer lies in the single word, "hon
esty." If every school in the nation—including
those in the PCC—were to observe a "sanity
code" such as we have on the West Coast, the
situation might be improved.
Obviously, this is a lot to ask.
However, as things now stand, high school
athletes are still encouraged to "sell their serv
ices to the highest bidder," and find themselves
accepting "on-the-side" donations to make up
for a lack of "expense" money.
We are told that such things do not exist at
Stanford — that this is one school which ob
serves the laws —both in fact and in spirit. We
do not deny this.
Maybe an answer to the overemphasis on in
tercollegiate football lies in a complete elimi
nation of all athletic scholarships and "gifts" of
one kind and another.
However, Stanford would still fail to attract
more athletes than it does at present. Most
athletes who want to compete in college are in
need of money and would prefer to live at a
less expensive school. So long as Stanford re
mains a private institution without state aid, this
condition will continue to exist.
Still we don't want to cut out athletics en
tirely. Neither does Dr. Sterling. We do want
to compete on an equal basis.
Looks like a stalemate. What do you think?

tuition scholarships to needy members of the
football, track, baseball, swimming, golf, and
tennis teams. Football, because of its impor
tance and large turnouts, receives about one
half to two-thirds of the scholarships.
Another thing: even though the NCAA
dropped its "sanity code" in January, the PCC
has its own brand of "sanity code" that pro
hibits conference schools from giving out any
scholarships that are not strictly of the tuition
variety.
The code also regulates the number of schol
arships each school may offer. Furthermore,
each athlete must live up to the scholastic
standards of his institution before he can even
become eligible for such a scholarship.
The clarifications made yesterday — though
they are most gratifying—serve only to com
plicate a solution to what Dr. Sterling called the
"rampant . . . proselytizing and subsidizing of
players . .

According to Publicity Director Liebendor
fer, the answer lies in the single word, "hon
esty." If every school in the nation—including
those in the PCC—were to observe a "sanity
code" such as we have on the West Coast, the
situation might be improved.
Obviously, this is a lot to ask.
However, as things now stand, high school
athletes are still encouraged to "sell their serv
ices to the highest bidder," and find themselves
accepting "on-the-side" donations to make up
for a lack of "expense" money.
We are told that such things do not exist at
Stanford — that this is one school which ob
serves the laws —both in fact and in spirit. We
do not deny this.
Maybe an answer to the overemphasis on in
tercollegiate football lies in a complete elimi
nation of all athletic scholarships and "gifts" of
one kind and another.
However, Stanford would still fail to attract
more athletes than it does at present. Most
athletes who want to compete in college are in
need of money and would prefer to live at a
less expensive school. So long as Stanford re
mains a private institution without state aid, this
condition will continue to exist.
Still we don't want to cut out athletics en
tirely. Neither does Dr. Sterling. We do want
to compete on an equal basis.
Looks like a stalemate. What do you think?
Yesterday in the editorial columns we said
that ALL "Buck of the Month Club" money is
turned into football scholarships. That was
how we understood it at the last meeting of the
Stanford Athletic Board.
The statement is not true, according to Don
Liebendorfer and A 1 Masters of the Athletic De
partment.
Actually, our informers tell us, the money is
distributed in the form of full-tuition and part
tuition scholarships to needy members of the
football, track, baseball, swimming, golf, and
tennis teams. Football, because of its impor
tance and large turnouts, receives about one
half to two-thirds of the scholarships.
