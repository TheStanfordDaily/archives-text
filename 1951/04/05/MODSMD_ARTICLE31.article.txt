# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'Rules' That Don't Help! 
### 
To the Editor:
There have been times in the past when I huve won
dered how consistent the University is about its desire
to keep track of us girls and help keep us out of trou
ble. Now after my experience this past weekend I
wonder even more.
I happened to be so unfortunate as to have had to
return from my vacation a day earlier than the wom
en's dorms officially opened. Ruble was open for girls
'laying there the entire vacation, and I can understand
the desire not to get out clean linen for me or bother
with registering me for just one night.
hut it also happened that my own dorm had
opened that morning for the girls who had stayed at
Kohle only. When I phoned in and asked for per
mission to enter and sleep in my own bed, I was de
nied it and severely bawled out for having returned
before Sunday noon. I couldn't even put part of my
baggage inside the lobby door for safe-keeping until
the "zero hour" arrived. I had spent my vacation
away from home and found it necessary to return
to campus early.
Since my freshman days I had always believed it
was preferable to return to your own dorm if anything
unavoidable comes up, under any circumstances. Now
: iiu :e when do iron-clad rules come before a girl's com
fort and perhaps her own personal safety? I'm sure
that at least 99 per cent of the girls here at Stanford
have fairly high personal standards and self-respect,
and 1 think it is about time that someone here at the
University looked at the problem of social regulations
ft'om thai positive angle instead of considering a girl
as a probable delinquent. Very few girls purposely
break legitimate social regulations, but the Univer
sity's policy of closing the doors on a girl who happens
to arrive before Sunday noon leaves the road wide
open for anything including possible tragedy.

. . . Their point is that if they had let me in, they
would have had to have let everyone else in, too. The
truth is that more people come back late from vacation
rather than early. My position was that I was back,
obviously from out of town, didn't know anyone
around the Palo Alto area well enough to ask them for
a bed for the night, and didn't have too much cash on
hand.
My suggestion is that the iron-clad policy be re
viewed and that those in charge use their own dis
cretion and their heads on whether to admit the girl
rather than just slamming the door in her face and
forcing her to go out and spend the night alone.
There could be a petition for the girl to fill out for
the hall director concerned.
To keep down the number of girls taking advantage
of a more lenient policy, a substantial but not extrava
gant fee, payable at the first of the coming quarter,
could be charged for this special consideration.
Anything is better than just taking a negative view
and doing nothing about it. I'm sure there must be
some solution to the problem that would still give the
R.A.'s a chance to enjoy a full vacation.

(The request for "their own discretion" seems
well-founded. Surely fraternities — for one — are
more than glad to welcome their residents early, if
only because the early-comers can start cleaning up
their rooms and otherwise getting ready for the new
quarter. If someone in authority is staying at the
women's dorm and it is in livable condition and not
under repair, a little individual responsibility and
discretion used in moving in those who come back
early seems to be worth investigation. Would such
investigation be asking too much, Miss Doyle? I will
be glad to furnish you with the author's name. — The
