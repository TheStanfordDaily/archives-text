# Foreign Students Sightsee, Return To Campus With Tales of Travels
## Far Western Cities Toured 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Out to see a bit of America
beyond Palm Drive, Stanford's
foreign scholarship students
spent a busy and enlightening
spring vacation, absorbing every
bit of scenery along their trav
els.
Hans Rossi of Switzerland, Henrik
j de la Chapt'lle from Finland (both
I ASSU scholars), Hans von Graeve
! nitz from Germany, and Rajendra
! Vikram Singh of India got off to an
! early start, having finished with
! finals on Monday. The international
I foursome drove past Lake Tahoe,
j which reminded Huns of Switzerland,
and made their first stop in Reno.
| Although the boys made the rounds
of the gambling houses, mainly to ob
serve the people, they couldn't resist
trying their own luck. Henrik hit the
jack-pot, while the others bet and
lost a little. Hans felt that Reno was
j a picture of what the old West was
like, and except for the nature of the
activities was quite different from the 1
Riviera casinos.
Las Vegas Pinch
By the time the travelers had
reached Las Vegas, their finances had
! sufficiently decreased to necessitate
! a bit of thrifty living. They figured
that four could share one motel room
j for the price of two. All went well
, until the next morning when the
i owner informed them that each
would have to pay his share. The
boys replied they knew nothing of
this upon taking the room, and the
owner threatened to call the sheriff.
| But the temporary excitement re- i
suited in no call to the sheriff and no !
| paying of the extra two dollars.
As (hey drove along, averaging 300 1
miles a day and trying to see as much
| as they could (they felt it might be
their iast opportunity to see Amer
ica) the boys kept their eyes on the
i scenery and their mouths in motion
! as they engaged in endless political
j bull sessions.
Bryce Canyon
Hans described Bryce Canyon as
the most beautiful part of their trip—
it was almost like the Alps except for
the round rock formations and red
and yeilow colors of the rocks re
flected by the sun.
At the Grand Canyon the four
some was joined by two Swiss boys
and Karl Kisler, ASSU foreign
scholar from Austria who was on his
way to Phoenix. Splitting up into two
groups the international party set off
for a long hike down into the canyon.
Hans' group managed to get three
hours ahead of the others, but they,
1 unfortunately, were not carrying the
food and water.
It was not until six that night, after
j seven hours of thirst and hunger, that

the parched ones found something to
drink. But all their hiking was worth
the magnificent sunset, which Hans
called "Alpengluhen" (when the sun
sets over snow-covered mountains
and everything turns red).
Movie Making
After a day of rest the four set off |
again, stopping at Phoenix for a
night, then on to San Diego and Los j
Angeles. The boys had gotten a pass |
to tour 20th Century-Fox, and saw
Cary Grant in the process of making ;
a movie.
They watched the cameramen I
shoot the same scene five times, when
minor actors had botched a line. The
sixth time all appeared to be going
smoothly when suddenly Mr. Grant
stopped and said, "What the hell is l
my line?"
Cactus Love
Jeanne Marie Villar of France
commented on her week's stay at a
friend's home in Tucson thus—"My |
heart is in Arizona. I have fallen in
love with the cactus."
Jeanne Marie was most impressed
by the giant cacti (for Europeans are
used to seeing cactus as big as a
thumb), the sunsets, the wide i

stretches of land, and the informality
and friendliness of the people. She
was amazed that after miles of noth
ingness a city as big and thriving as
Tucson should suddenly appear.
Jeanne Marie visited Mexico for a
day and described the difference on
each side of the border — on one
people were rushing around, very
businesslike, while on the other
people were sitting in the streets.
Northern California
Klaus Vollmer, ASSU scholar from
Germany, traveled up through
Northern California with another
German student, Werner Kubsch.

Klaus was completely taken in by the
redwoods and remarked that ordi
nary trees will never look good to
him any more. He remembered a
picture in his geology textbook in
Germany of a car going through a
giant redwood, and how he had never
believed it. "Now, I know it's true,"
he said.
Klaus told how people in lumber
camps insisted that he and Werner
eat with them, and how interested
they were in Germany. He said that
this was the best vacation he had
ever had—that traveling was the best
way to learn.
No People, No Houses
Reiko Ishikawa, from Tokyo, ex
perienced her first long train ride on
her wpy to Denver, where she spent
the week at a Stanford student's
home. She was amazed that every
thing was so big, that one could trav
el for miles without seeing people or
houses. In Japan, she explained, no
one would believe this, for every
thing is so small, and every available
space is packed with people.
Reiko spoke for all the students
when she remarked that the oppor
tunity to travel outside of Stanford
and to spend some time in an Ameri
can home, were experiences which
would enrich her memories of the
United States.


REAL PROOF—Klaus Vollmer, German student here on an AS
SU Foreign Scholarship, never believed those stories of trees
big enough to drive cars through, but he's no longer a doubter.
This picture was taken in the redwoods of Northern California,
where Klaus and Werner Kubsch spent spring vacation.
