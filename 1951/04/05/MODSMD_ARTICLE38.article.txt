# Cellar-Dwelling Indians Tackle Bears Tomorrow
## 
### 
Right now the Stanford baseball
team and the San Francisco Seals
have one thing in common—they're
both in the basement.
But Everett Dean's Indians hope
to stage a comeback tomorrow when
they engage the California Bears
here on the Sunken Diamond.
Coached by grouchy Clint Evans
(nine championshpis in 18 years),
the Bears have a veteran team, but
a good share of the veterans are
higher on experience than ability.
The way some of them kicked the
ball around last year, they, and not
the professors, should have taken
the Loyalty Oath.
McNinch and Dodson Good Men
The visitors, however, do boast
two fine prospects in first baseman
Syl McNinch and second baseman
Don Dodson ,who was All-CIBA,
All-Coast, and all over the infield.
Evans thinks so much of McNinch
that he once halted practice to look
for a good-luck trinket that the
agile first - sacker had lost some
where on the diamond.
Twenty-iive-year-old Carl Ana
clerio covers third, and either Jim
Crew or Donnie Monroe will open
at short. Crew was the leading

frosh clubber last year, while Mon
roe was the least hitting regular in
the CIBA with an .086 average.
Crew also plays third when ancient
Carl gets tired.
Pete Corona, .259 last year and
no Charlie Cole in the outfield, Al
Daxies, gridder lom Keough, Cas
Munoz, Hoot Bennett, Ed Milano,
and Hugh Huddleston are all mem
bers of the outfield juggling troupe.
Gil Beck and Bob Henderson do
the receiving for the Bears.
Cal Loaded with Pitchers
It is in the hurling department
that the Berkeleyites are loaded.
Heading the list are righties Bill
Nishita and Andy Stagnaro. Lefties
Bucky Cowan, Ed Mayer, and Bob
McWhirter have also been mean to
opposing batters.
Stanford fans should be sure to
attend tomorrow's Cal game as
Coach Evans alwyas provides a good
show, the best being here in 1948
when he (1) engaged in a 15-min
ute rhubarb, (2) pushed three Stan
ford players off of him, and (3) cli
maxed the fracas by having a verbal
tiff with his pitcher Nino Barnise
who just wouldn't leave the contest
in spite of the Clinter's prolonged
pleadings.
Osenbaugh lo Hurl for Cards
Dean's nomination for starting
hurler will be Rog Osenbaugh. the
man with good stuff when he gets it
over. Unless Big Bill Herron re
placed Dick Corzine behind home
plate, the lineup will be the same
as that which faced the USC Tro
jans.

Crew also plays third when ancient
Carl gets tired.
Pete Corona, .259 last year and
no Charlie Cole in the outfield, Al
Daxies, gridder lom Keough, Cas
Munoz, Hoot Bennett, Ed Milano,
and Hugh Huddleston are all mem
bers of the outfield juggling troupe.
Gil Beck and Bob Henderson do
the receiving for the Bears.
Cal Loaded with Pitchers
It is in the hurling department
that the Berkeleyites are loaded.
Heading the list are righties Bill
Nishita and Andy Stagnaro. Lefties
Bucky Cowan, Ed Mayer, and Bob
McWhirter have also been mean to
opposing batters.
Stanford fans should be sure to
attend tomorrow's Cal game as
Coach Evans alwyas provides a good
show, the best being here in 1948
when he (1) engaged in a 15-min
ute rhubarb, (2) pushed three Stan
ford players off of him, and (3) cli
maxed the fracas by having a verbal
tiff with his pitcher Nino Barnise
who just wouldn't leave the contest
in spite of the Clinter's prolonged
pleadings.
Osenbaugh lo Hurl for Cards
Dean's nomination for starting
hurler will be Rog Osenbaugh. the
man with good stuff when he gets it
over. Unless Big Bill Herron re
placed Dick Corzine behind home
plate, the lineup will be the same
as that which faced the USC Tro
jans.


ANDY STAGNAKO
—Ace Cal pitcher
Right now the Stanford baseball
team and the San Francisco Seals
have one thing in common—they're
both in the basement.
But Everett Dean's Indians hope
to stage a comeback tomorrow when
they engage the California Bears
here on the Sunken Diamond.
Coached by grouchy Clint Evans
(nine championshpis in 18 years),
the Bears have a veteran team, but
a good share of the veterans are
higher on experience than ability.
The way some of them kicked the
ball around last year, they, and not
the professors, should have taken
the Loyalty Oath.
McNinch and Dodson Good Men
The visitors, however, do boast
two fine prospects in first baseman
Syl McNinch and second baseman
Don Dodson ,who was All-CIBA,
All-Coast, and all over the infield.
Evans thinks so much of McNinch
that he once halted practice to look
for a good-luck trinket that the
agile first - sacker had lost some
where on the diamond.
Twenty-iive-year-old Carl Ana
clerio covers third, and either Jim
Crew or Donnie Monroe will open
at short. Crew was the leading

frosh clubber last year, while Mon
roe was the least hitting regular in
the CIBA with an .086 average.
Crew also plays third when ancient
Carl gets tired.
Pete Corona, .259 last year and
no Charlie Cole in the outfield, Al
Daxies, gridder lom Keough, Cas
