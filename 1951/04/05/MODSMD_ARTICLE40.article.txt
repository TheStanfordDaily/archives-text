## BOB BERNSTEIN Midweek Musings A Bagful of Publicity Tricks 
### 
Even the most hard-boiled critics of Marchie Schwartz used to concede :
that as a public relations man the dapper grid mentor had few peers. Now i
comes along Chuck Taylor—red-headed, homespun, and easy-grinning— to i
show Farm fans a few publicity tricks they've never seen before.
Concerning his latest and most novel scheme, the Big Switch Taylor
admits he doesn't even remember where the idea first originated.
Says he:"I think it was a San Francisco sportswriter who first mentioned
that it would be interesting to watch the sports critics actually coach a foot- !
ball team. Then later, the whole idea of the switch-for-a-day popped sud- 1
denly into mind."
But Chuck has forged into the public relations game with a number of !
other maneuvers since taking over the reins some two months ago.
For one thing, the youthful dynamo has done a tremendous job of re
stoking the latent fire of school spirit in alumni groups which had tended
to drift from the alma mammy of late. By the middle of May, he will
have spoken to 11 alumni groups as far separated as Spokane and Los
Angeles; and a goodly portion of each day's vvorktime has been occu
pied with making personal contact with hundreds of prospective Farm
suppportei's.
As if that wouldn't be enough to keep three ordinary men busy, the red
headed one has somehow found time for no little bush beating of the prep
ranges, plus more hours devoted to the myriad organizational chores asso
ciated with the pending spring drills.
During spring quarter, Chuck and his staff will make the luncheon circuit
of the various Farm fraternities and other living groups—a further good
will undertaking, unknown to his predecessors.
Taylor's scouring of the prep circles, incidentally, has already produced
some results. At least five broad-shouldered prospects have already
checked in at the Farm and will be on hand for spring practice.
Included among these newcomers is John Stanton, a 205-pound all-
Wyoming guard, who was personally scouted by Frank Leahy last season.
Stanton practically had his ticket to South Bend when, apparently, he de
cided that he preferred the sunnier clime of the Bay Area. . . .
Where to Use Mathias on the Grid
The unexpected announcement that Bob Mathias will turn out for the
grid game has started a beehive of speculation hereabouts.
Frankie Albeit, on whose television show Bob disclosed his football plans,
has expressed the opinion that Bob's tremendous speed, height, and weight
make him a good running-mate at end for Ail-American Bill McColl.
But Mathias is leaving it up to Taylor to pick out the best spot for him.
A fullback at Kiski (Pa.) prep. Bob played from the single wing and has
no experience with Taylor's T-tactics. Too. he'll encounter some rugged
competition at fullback in the persons of Skip Crist, Bob Griffin, and
Bob Meyer.
In any event, the enigma won't be solved until next fall, since Bob can't
take time out from his current track duties to attend spring practice. . . .
Shades of something-or-other: The Paly High varsity mermen recently
splashed to the 70th consecutive win by drowning Jefferson High, 55 to 20.
Like the Seals, only in reverse. . . .
Pulled leg muscles will someday be known as "Bryan's disease," if the
current state of affairs continues. Bob, who was injured last Saturday
in the Stanford-Fresno dual, now appears able to run at least one race
in the Southland Saturday; but Gay, who would like to contribute his
services to the Olympic Club, is not sure when he'll be in shape.
However, Gaylord, the world traveler whose recent competition in the
Pan-American Games marked his fourth foreign trip in recent years, has
this for consolation: his scheduled (April 14) call to active duty has been
cancelled by the Navy powers-that-be.

has expressed the opinion that Bob's tremendous speed, height, and weight
make him a good running-mate at end for Ail-American Bill McColl.
But Mathias is leaving it up to Taylor to pick out the best spot for him.
A fullback at Kiski (Pa.) prep. Bob played from the single wing and has
no experience with Taylor's T-tactics. Too. he'll encounter some rugged
competition at fullback in the persons of Skip Crist, Bob Griffin, and
Bob Meyer.
In any event, the enigma won't be solved until next fall, since Bob can't
take time out from his current track duties to attend spring practice. . . .
Shades of something-or-other: The Paly High varsity mermen recently
splashed to the 70th consecutive win by drowning Jefferson High, 55 to 20.
Like the Seals, only in reverse. . . .
Pulled leg muscles will someday be known as "Bryan's disease," if the
current state of affairs continues. Bob, who was injured last Saturday
in the Stanford-Fresno dual, now appears able to run at least one race
in the Southland Saturday; but Gay, who would like to contribute his
services to the Olympic Club, is not sure when he'll be in shape.
However, Gaylord, the world traveler whose recent competition in the
Pan-American Games marked his fourth foreign trip in recent years, has
this for consolation: his scheduled (April 14) call to active duty has been
cancelled by the Navy powers-that-be.
Even the most hard-boiled critics of Marchie Schwartz used to concede :
that as a public relations man the dapper grid mentor had few peers. Now i
comes along Chuck Taylor—red-headed, homespun, and easy-grinning— to i
show Farm fans a few publicity tricks they've never seen before.
Concerning his latest and most novel scheme, the Big Switch Taylor
admits he doesn't even remember where the idea first originated.
Says he:"I think it was a San Francisco sportswriter who first mentioned
that it would be interesting to watch the sports critics actually coach a foot- !
ball team. Then later, the whole idea of the switch-for-a-day popped sud- 1
denly into mind."
But Chuck has forged into the public relations game with a number of !
other maneuvers since taking over the reins some two months ago.
For one thing, the youthful dynamo has done a tremendous job of re
stoking the latent fire of school spirit in alumni groups which had tended
to drift from the alma mammy of late. By the middle of May, he will
have spoken to 11 alumni groups as far separated as Spokane and Los
Angeles; and a goodly portion of each day's vvorktime has been occu
pied with making personal contact with hundreds of prospective Farm
suppportei's.
As if that wouldn't be enough to keep three ordinary men busy, the red
headed one has somehow found time for no little bush beating of the prep
ranges, plus more hours devoted to the myriad organizational chores asso
ciated with the pending spring drills.
During spring quarter, Chuck and his staff will make the luncheon circuit
of the various Farm fraternities and other living groups—a further good
will undertaking, unknown to his predecessors.
Taylor's scouring of the prep circles, incidentally, has already produced
some results. At least five broad-shouldered prospects have already
checked in at the Farm and will be on hand for spring practice.
Included among these newcomers is John Stanton, a 205-pound all-
Wyoming guard, who was personally scouted by Frank Leahy last season.
Stanton practically had his ticket to South Bend when, apparently, he de
cided that he preferred the sunnier clime of the Bay Area. . . .
Where to Use Mathias on the Grid
The unexpected announcement that Bob Mathias will turn out for the
grid game has started a beehive of speculation hereabouts.
Frankie Albeit, on whose television show Bob disclosed his football plans,
has expressed the opinion that Bob's tremendous speed, height, and weight
make him a good running-mate at end for Ail-American Bill McColl.
