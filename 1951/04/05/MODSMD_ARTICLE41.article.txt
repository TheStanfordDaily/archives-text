# Frosh Beat Washington For Fifth Straight Win
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh baseballers made
it five straight yesterday, defeating
Washington High School of Sun
Francisco, 9 to 7, on the frosh field.
Cage star Don DeLong made his
debut as a pitcher and went all the
way for the win. DeLong thus joins
what looks to be one of the strongest
mound staffs in Farm frosh history.
DeLong, Phil Page, Jack Goddard,
and John Mauldin have allowed
only 34 hits while striking out 38
batters in their first five games.
Against Washington, the Card
babes scored once in the first when
Joe Miller tripled and scored on a
wild pitch. In the third they tal
lied again with gridster Frank Te
nerello's double doing the damage.
Then in the fourth and fifth the
roof fell in as the Papooses scored
seven runs on three hits and a bevy
of errors.
It was then that Washington
found the range on the tiring De-
Long. who had twirled spectacular
two-hit shutout ball for four in
nings, but by then it was too late,
and what runs Washington made
only amounted to fielding practice
for the frosh.
Today the Papooses will try for
the sixth straight, as they meet Se
quoia High School from Redwood
City on the local frosh field.
