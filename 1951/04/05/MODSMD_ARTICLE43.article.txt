# Netmen Fly South
## 
### 
Opening the Southern Division
PCC tennis race this weekend, the
Stanford racketmen will journey
south tomorrow to meet UCLA and
USC. Friday they will be the guests
of the NCAA champion Bruins, and
Saturday they will take to the Fi
gueroa Street courts to volley with
the PCC champion Trojans.
Making the trip for the Cards are
George Gentry, Charlie Hickox,
Vince Schmieder. Tom Lewyn, Phil
Nielsen, Bob Sibert, and Dean
Brinkman. But Coach Bob Renker

has not announced any assignments I
as yet.
The Trojans and Bruins, unques- 1
tionably the two top teams in col- j
legiate tennis last year, should be
very tough. The Bruins have lost
intercollegiate champ Herb Flam,
along with Gene Garrett and Glen j
Bassett. Top man for the Bruins
this year is Jack Shoemaker, who j
should play a very close match with
Stanford's Gentry.
i
j The Trojans will be extremely
I tugh in the top two singles places
i and at first doubles, where Earl Co
! chell and Hugh Stewart will provide
j the punch: but word has it that they
j are weak lower down. If the fast
j improving Cards can knock over
J either one of these top dogs, they
1 will mark Stanford as a future ten- j
! nis power.
