# Cardinal Swimmers Were Successful In Texas NCAA Championship Meet
## 
### 
Stanford's swimming team re
turned to Palo Alto Sunday night
after a highly successful week at
the NCAA swimming meet at Aus
tin, Texas.
The Cards took fourth place in
the meet with 25 points, behind Yale
(81), Michigan State (GO), and Ohio
State (58), and ahead of Texas (15).
The big news of the meet was the
performances of Yale's John Mar
shall. A sophomore from Australia
(draft exempt), Marshall won three
races, the 220- and 440-yard and the
1,500 - meter freestyle. In two of
[ these races, he broke the existing
world records, and in the third, the
220, he was only a tenth of a second
behind his own world record.
In the quarter-mile and the 220,
Yale scored a sweep, with Marshall
first, Wayne Moore second, and Mc-
Lane third. Cole was fourth in the
440 and fifth in the 220. In the 440,
the first five men were under the
I winning time posted last year by
i Stanford's Ralph Sala.
Bad Break for Stanford
Stanford suffered a bad break
when the coach, Tom Haynie, came
down with a bad attack of tonsilitis,
and was hospitalized for all but one
night of the three-day meet. Bruce
Harlan, who drove down to the
meet, took over the controls, and

was very successful in the impor- j
tant "scratch meetings," which de- >
j termine which lanes the swimmers
swim in, and which heats they are
in. Harlan, 1948 Olympic (living
champ and now the Stanford diving
j coach, was also one <Jf the five div
ing judges.
"Froj" Conies Through
Best individual come-through by
a Stanford man was by team captain
Bob Frojen. "Froj" started out his
races by qualifying for the 200-yard
breast-stroke, which was unexpect
ed, and finishing fifth in 2:22.8, fast
est time ever done by a Stanford
breaststroker. In the 100 - yard
1 breaststroke Saturday, Bob. who
was given Ail-American water polo
honors this year by the AAU, quali-
I fied in the number one spot. In the 1

! finals, however, he was nipped out
! by Princeton's world record holder
Bob Brawner, in the closest race of
| the meet.
In the medley relay, in which
Stanford took third, Frojen was the
main cog. In the heats, he pulled
the team into second position just
behind Ohio State, with a 1:00.3 100.
With the aid of Putnam in the buck
stroke and Bobby Thompson in the
freestyle, the team did 2:54 to qual
ify third. In the finals, Putnam led
of'r with a 1:02.9 100 back, which
I had the team in sixth place. Frojen
, dove in and pulled up to third place
just behind Michigan State, swim
ning the very good time of 59.8 for
his 100. Thompson finished up with
an excellent 51.2. j
