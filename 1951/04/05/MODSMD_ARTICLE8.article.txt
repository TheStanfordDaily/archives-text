WASHINGTON, April 4 (UP) i
— The House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee today listed
Academy Award winners Jose
Ferrer and Judy Holliday as "af
filiated with five to 10 Commu
nist-front organizations."
The two stars who last week won ;
"Oscars" for the best movie perform- >
ances of 1950 were listed by the com- ■
mittee as sponsors of a Communist- }
front "peace" conference held in New
York in March, 1949.
Ferrer was included in a list of 49 I
of the conference sponsors who, the j
committee said, "have given their j
open support to Communist candi- !
! dates in election campaigns." I
Ferrer, who won the Academy |
Award for the putty-nosed 1 itie role i
1 in "Cyrano de Bcrgerac," said in a |
! statement recently that he is not and !
| never has been a Communist, and |
| offered to co-operate with the com
mittee. He has been subpenaed to j
testify April 20 in the committee's |
new communism -in - Hollywood j
hearings.
There has been no announcement !
that Miss Holliday, who won her j
statuette for her role in "Born Ye.s- j
I terday," has been subpenaed.
The committee said the world-wide
I Communist "peace" campaign, in- |
eluding its U.S. organizations, is the
i "most dangerous hoax ever devised !
I by the international Communist con- j
j spiracy."
The "peace" drive, the report said, !
is actually part of a Communist drive
for world conquest.
