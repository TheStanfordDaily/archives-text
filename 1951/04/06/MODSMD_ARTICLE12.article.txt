### JOY HAAS 
We can get away on spring vacations, plan beach parties at
Half Moon Bay, or head for Donner Summit, but sooner or later
we have to come back and face the same old problems and ques
tions, because now they affect us directly. ,
We wonder if we should enlist for four years or wait for the

draft, and why fight the other guy's
war, anyway? We would like to skip
the propaganda and find out if there
are any real possibilities for world
peace.
A few weeks ago a group of stu
dents got together to talk over the

cided that if anyone could help find
the answers, it would be men here

finding answers.
