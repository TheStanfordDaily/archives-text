# Excom Considers Reg Dance, Cellar Trash Problems
## 
### 
The failure of Monday night's rcg
dance on which the sponsors—the
eating clubs—lost $80 has prompted
Excom to seek a way of making fu
ture quarter-opening socials profi
table.
In this case, Excom had failed to
pick a sponsoring organization until
the final meeting of last quarter.
Only one group had applied for the
date at that time. Ted Buttner, AS
SU president, said Wednesday night
that publicity concerning applica
tions ought to be issued earlier in
the quarter preceding the reg dance.
Vice-President Jo Lyon said win
ter and spring quarter dances often
lose money and as a result student
organizations are reluctant to spon
sor them. Chief cause of the poor
turnouts is the fact that, students
return from Christmas and Easter
vacations late on registration day
and are too tired to go to the dance,
said Carol Penney, women's Row
representative. She suggested that
the affairs be scheduled later in the
week.
The matter was sent to Activities
Board and the Public Relations
Committee.
Cellar Untidiness
The problem of untidiness at the
Cellar's "sidewalk cafe" was also met
by Excom Wednesday. Though the
question has come up several times
in the past few months, Ted Buttner
reported that, the situation i.; still
"deplorable."
Bill Bethke, Men's Row represen
tative said students cluster about the
trash cans and discourage their use.
Buttner agreed, hut said that does
not excuse negligence, fie also noted
that the patio will eventually h > ex
fended almost to the sidewalk "n
Lasuen street.
Excom voted $25 for a public ad
dress system to call attention 'o per
sons who fail to use the red trash
barrels.
