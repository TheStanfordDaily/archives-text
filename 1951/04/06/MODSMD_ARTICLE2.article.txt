### 
NEW YORK, April ."> (UP)—The
husband-and-wifc atomic .spy team
of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg wore
sentenced to death today for passing
A - bomb secrets to Russia in a
crime that "altered the course of
history," according to Federal Judge
Irving Kaufman.
Thin, bespectacled Rosenberg, 32,
stood tense. His tiny, 35-year-old
wife turned ashen. Never before in
a civil court of the United States
had native - born spies ever been
sentenced to death. Seldom, if ever,
had a husband and wife been sen
tenced to this for any crime.
"I believe your conduct . . . has
already caused the Communist ag
gression in Korea with the result
ant casualties exceeding 0.000
Americans —and who knows but that
millions more of innocent people
may p;iy the price of your treason,"
Judge Kaufman told the defendants.
