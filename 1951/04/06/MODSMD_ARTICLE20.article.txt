# STANFORD STUDENTS
## ...And The Draft 
### RICHARD L. BALCH Chief Counselor for Men, Stanford University 
There has been much discussion throughout the country in
newspapers and on the radio as to the moral issue facing univer
sity and college students when interpreting the new Selective
Service regulations recently signed by the President of the United
States. In fairness to the questions that have been asked, the fol
lowing statements made by the Association of American Colleges
in the preamble to its Declaration on Manpower, should be quoted:
"The present national emergency is without parallel in our
entire history. It will extend over a long period. It will require
great sacrifice. Both from within and from without, it threatens
our basic heritage of freedom.
The American college and university recognizes the gravity of
the crisis and is actively aware that the national welfare must take
precedence over other considerations. It is recognized that there
is a present and presumably continuing requirement that essen
tially all able-bodied young men give service of a proper length of
time in the nation's military forces. As representatives of higher
education, we recognize the importance of meeting this require
ment to the full. We believe that all young men should sharo
equitably the responsibility of national defense.
Key Is in Use of Manpower
It is our conviction that the key to ultimate national survival 13
the wise use of manpower. In the immediate pressure to have now
the men we need in the places where they seem needed, we must
not lose sight of the long-range importance of providing a constant
flow of trained persons to fill critical places two years, five years,
ten years or more hence. Leadership of all types, political, eco
onmic, military, educational, and religious, will be even more ne
cessary in the years ahead than today. Further, in a democratic na
tion we deal with men as indivdiuals not as units in the mass. No
effective manpower program will treat men in the mass without
concern for their dignity as human beings and their individual dif
ferences. If we lose sight of this truth, the battle with totalitarian
ism has been lost at the start."
Following the new executive order authorizing General Hershey
to defer students enrolled in college on the basis of (1) a nation
wide test, (2) the established academic record, and (3) both test
and or academic record, there has been a great deal of discussion
of the pure moral issue concerning universities as draft evasion
centers. In making moral judgments it is necessary that the public
be fully informed of the action that universities and colleges have
taken in their "Declaration on Manpower." If universities can be
considered draft evasion centers after careful reading of the above
declaration, then the individual making such a moral judgment is
declaring democracy to be a level of mentality. This has never
been the case in this country, and we have progressed only be
cause the opportunity has been presented to those mentally quali
fied to continue their education.
Collegians WILL Have to Serve
It is the moral obliqation of the universities and colleges
throughout the country to aid in the selection of those potentially
able to lead the country. We will not allow a student who is using
a universiy as a safe haven from the draft to continue his educa
tion in a worthless manner. If at any time a Stanford man is not
using his best efforts to acquire the necessary tools to further the
national welfare as an educated man, it will be imperative to report
such a matter to his local draft board so that the privileqe of attend
ing college will be denied him. It will not matter whether a scoro
of 70 on the national test is involved or his academic average in the
University. If he is not pursuing satisfactorily the work he is under
taking, he should not remain in the University.
It should be further pointed out that men deferred in college
by reason of their standing in class or their test score will have a
draft obligation upon completion of their education lor two years,
with another eight years reguired to serve in a reserve capacity.
In the ROTC program the same two years will be required upon
graduation with the important exception that a man trained in col
lege for leadership will be commissioned in the ROTC. A man de
ferred on the basis of a test score or a percentage in class will be
inducted into the draft.
Ail-Around Superiority Needed
There should be little question in the minds of Stanford men
that they have an obligation to the military or to the national wel
fare facing them as citizens of the United States. This obligation
will be a continuing and increasing one. If there are any men now
enrolled in Stanford who do not view realistically the fact that they
will eventually devote some time to the preservation of the national
welfare, they are not deserving of membership in the Stanford
Family. This is not a question of flag-waving patriotism. It is a
realization of the fact that in all probability we are fighting a long
war of ideology in which our superiority cannot be merely in terms
of numbers but must be a superiority brought about by scientific
and technological advancement.

Such h premise implies the abso- i
lute necessity of continuing our uni
versity programs for those men of
high ability.
A < an individual greatly interested
in flic welfare of Stanford students,!
of Stanford University, and the wcl
fare of this nation, it has been a priv
ilege ;md I hope it will continue to
he ;i privilege to commend Stanford
men ,ind women on their acceptance
of a confused national policy. I sin
cerely hope that during the coming
months national policy will be so de
termined that you may plan for the
obligation that you have to preserve
our national welfare. This may come
in the form of our national govern
ment specifically defining your job,
or it may come through your ability
to plan your own future, fitting in
your own particular abilities as the
need arises.
Let me assure you that in mv opin
ion vou are doing the right thing in
continuing to aid this country in the
retention of a continuous flow of
leadership in every area of American
life. We must have this insurance in
order to prevent curtailment of the
technological and intellectual leader
ship that is America.

There should be little question in the minds of Stanford men
that they have an obligation to the military or to the national wel
fare facing them as citizens of the United States. This obligation
will be a continuing and increasing one. If there are any men now
enrolled in Stanford who do not view realistically the fact that they
will eventually devote some time to the preservation of the national
welfare, they are not deserving of membership in the Stanford
Family. This is not a question of flag-waving patriotism. It is a
realization of the fact that in all probability we are fighting a long
war of ideology in which our superiority cannot be merely in terms
of numbers but must be a superiority brought about by scientific
and technological advancement.

Such h premise implies the abso- i
lute necessity of continuing our uni
versity programs for those men of
high ability.
A < an individual greatly interested
in flic welfare of Stanford students,!
of Stanford University, and the wcl
fare of this nation, it has been a priv
ilege ;md I hope it will continue to
he ;i privilege to commend Stanford
men ,ind women on their acceptance
of a confused national policy. I sin
cerely hope that during the coming
months national policy will be so de
termined that you may plan for the
obligation that you have to preserve
our national welfare. This may come
in the form of our national govern
ment specifically defining your job,
or it may come through your ability
to plan your own future, fitting in
your own particular abilities as the
need arises.
Let me assure you that in mv opin
ion vou are doing the right thing in
continuing to aid this country in the
retention of a continuous flow of
leadership in every area of American
life. We must have this insurance in
order to prevent curtailment of the
technological and intellectual leader
ship that is America.
There has been much discussion throughout the country in
newspapers and on the radio as to the moral issue facing univer
sity and college students when interpreting the new Selective
Service regulations recently signed by the President of the United
States. In fairness to the questions that have been asked, the fol
lowing statements made by the Association of American Colleges
in the preamble to its Declaration on Manpower, should be quoted:
"The present national emergency is without parallel in our
entire history. It will extend over a long period. It will require
great sacrifice. Both from within and from without, it threatens
our basic heritage of freedom.
The American college and university recognizes the gravity of
the crisis and is actively aware that the national welfare must take
precedence over other considerations. It is recognized that there
is a present and presumably continuing requirement that essen
tially all able-bodied young men give service of a proper length of
time in the nation's military forces. As representatives of higher
education, we recognize the importance of meeting this require
ment to the full. We believe that all young men should sharo
equitably the responsibility of national defense.
Key Is in Use of Manpower
It is our conviction that the key to ultimate national survival 13
the wise use of manpower. In the immediate pressure to have now
the men we need in the places where they seem needed, we must
not lose sight of the long-range importance of providing a constant
flow of trained persons to fill critical places two years, five years,
ten years or more hence. Leadership of all types, political, eco
onmic, military, educational, and religious, will be even more ne
cessary in the years ahead than today. Further, in a democratic na
tion we deal with men as indivdiuals not as units in the mass. No
effective manpower program will treat men in the mass without
concern for their dignity as human beings and their individual dif
ferences. If we lose sight of this truth, the battle with totalitarian
ism has been lost at the start."
Following the new executive order authorizing General Hershey
to defer students enrolled in college on the basis of (1) a nation
wide test, (2) the established academic record, and (3) both test
and or academic record, there has been a great deal of discussion
of the pure moral issue concerning universities as draft evasion
centers. In making moral judgments it is necessary that the public
be fully informed of the action that universities and colleges have
taken in their "Declaration on Manpower." If universities can be
considered draft evasion centers after careful reading of the above
declaration, then the individual making such a moral judgment is
declaring democracy to be a level of mentality. This has never
been the case in this country, and we have progressed only be
cause the opportunity has been presented to those mentally quali
fied to continue their education.
Collegians WILL Have to Serve
It is the moral obliqation of the universities and colleges
throughout the country to aid in the selection of those potentially
able to lead the country. We will not allow a student who is using
a universiy as a safe haven from the draft to continue his educa
tion in a worthless manner. If at any time a Stanford man is not
using his best efforts to acquire the necessary tools to further the
national welfare as an educated man, it will be imperative to report
such a matter to his local draft board so that the privileqe of attend
ing college will be denied him. It will not matter whether a scoro
of 70 on the national test is involved or his academic average in the
University. If he is not pursuing satisfactorily the work he is under
taking, he should not remain in the University.
It should be further pointed out that men deferred in college
by reason of their standing in class or their test score will have a
draft obligation upon completion of their education lor two years,
with another eight years reguired to serve in a reserve capacity.
In the ROTC program the same two years will be required upon
graduation with the important exception that a man trained in col
lege for leadership will be commissioned in the ROTC. A man de
ferred on the basis of a test score or a percentage in class will be
inducted into the draft.

centers. In making moral judgments it is necessary that the public
be fully informed of the action that universities and colleges have
taken in their "Declaration on Manpower." If universities can be
considered draft evasion centers after careful reading of the above
declaration, then the individual making such a moral judgment is
declaring democracy to be a level of mentality. This has never
been the case in this country, and we have progressed only be
cause the opportunity has been presented to those mentally quali
fied to continue their education.
Collegians WILL Have to Serve
It is the moral obliqation of the universities and colleges
throughout the country to aid in the selection of those potentially
able to lead the country. We will not allow a student who is using
a universiy as a safe haven from the draft to continue his educa
tion in a worthless manner. If at any time a Stanford man is not
using his best efforts to acquire the necessary tools to further the
national welfare as an educated man, it will be imperative to report
such a matter to his local draft board so that the privileqe of attend
ing college will be denied him. It will not matter whether a scoro
of 70 on the national test is involved or his academic average in the
University. If he is not pursuing satisfactorily the work he is under
taking, he should not remain in the University.
It should be further pointed out that men deferred in college
by reason of their standing in class or their test score will have a
draft obligation upon completion of their education lor two years,
with another eight years reguired to serve in a reserve capacity.
In the ROTC program the same two years will be required upon
graduation with the important exception that a man trained in col
lege for leadership will be commissioned in the ROTC. A man de
ferred on the basis of a test score or a percentage in class will be
inducted into the draft.
Ail-Around Superiority Needed
There should be little question in the minds of Stanford men
that they have an obligation to the military or to the national wel
fare facing them as citizens of the United States. This obligation
will be a continuing and increasing one. If there are any men now
enrolled in Stanford who do not view realistically the fact that they
will eventually devote some time to the preservation of the national
welfare, they are not deserving of membership in the Stanford
Family. This is not a question of flag-waving patriotism. It is a
realization of the fact that in all probability we are fighting a long
war of ideology in which our superiority cannot be merely in terms
of numbers but must be a superiority brought about by scientific
and technological advancement.

Such h premise implies the abso- i
lute necessity of continuing our uni
versity programs for those men of
high ability.
A < an individual greatly interested
in flic welfare of Stanford students,!
of Stanford University, and the wcl
fare of this nation, it has been a priv
ilege ;md I hope it will continue to
he ;i privilege to commend Stanford
men ,ind women on their acceptance
of a confused national policy. I sin
cerely hope that during the coming
months national policy will be so de
termined that you may plan for the
obligation that you have to preserve
our national welfare. This may come
in the form of our national govern
ment specifically defining your job,
or it may come through your ability
to plan your own future, fitting in
your own particular abilities as the
need arises.
Let me assure you that in mv opin
ion vou are doing the right thing in
continuing to aid this country in the
retention of a continuous flow of
leadership in every area of American
life. We must have this insurance in
order to prevent curtailment of the
technological and intellectual leader
ship that is America.
There has been much discussion throughout the country in
newspapers and on the radio as to the moral issue facing univer
sity and college students when interpreting the new Selective
Service regulations recently signed by the President of the United
States. In fairness to the questions that have been asked, the fol
lowing statements made by the Association of American Colleges
in the preamble to its Declaration on Manpower, should be quoted:
"The present national emergency is without parallel in our
entire history. It will extend over a long period. It will require
great sacrifice. Both from within and from without, it threatens
our basic heritage of freedom.
The American college and university recognizes the gravity of
the crisis and is actively aware that the national welfare must take
precedence over other considerations. It is recognized that there
is a present and presumably continuing requirement that essen
tially all able-bodied young men give service of a proper length of
time in the nation's military forces. As representatives of higher
education, we recognize the importance of meeting this require
ment to the full. We believe that all young men should sharo
equitably the responsibility of national defense.
Key Is in Use of Manpower
It is our conviction that the key to ultimate national survival 13
the wise use of manpower. In the immediate pressure to have now
the men we need in the places where they seem needed, we must
not lose sight of the long-range importance of providing a constant
flow of trained persons to fill critical places two years, five years,
ten years or more hence. Leadership of all types, political, eco
onmic, military, educational, and religious, will be even more ne
cessary in the years ahead than today. Further, in a democratic na
tion we deal with men as indivdiuals not as units in the mass. No
effective manpower program will treat men in the mass without
concern for their dignity as human beings and their individual dif
ferences. If we lose sight of this truth, the battle with totalitarian
ism has been lost at the start."
Following the new executive order authorizing General Hershey
to defer students enrolled in college on the basis of (1) a nation
wide test, (2) the established academic record, and (3) both test
and or academic record, there has been a great deal of discussion
of the pure moral issue concerning universities as draft evasion
centers. In making moral judgments it is necessary that the public
