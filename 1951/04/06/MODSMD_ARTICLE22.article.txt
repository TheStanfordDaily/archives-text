# A 						Letter from the Phone Company

The following is a copy ot a letter written
recently by Men's Counselor Richard Balch
to A.SSU Student Manager Dave Elliott:
Dear Dave:
For the past three months the Business Office
of the Telephone Company has been in touch
with Stanford regarding misuse of public tele
phones on campus.
It seems there has been a growing fad to
drop 25-cent pieces or nickels into public tele
phones with wire or siring attached, along with
(he spinning of pennies into coin boxes.
If this misuse continues, Stanford will be
without public telephones as it costs the Tele
phone Company more to repair the damage
done by wires and threads left in coin boxes
iJjan they can possibly earn from having the
public telephones established here on the cam
pus.
I suggest that this matter be taken up by
Excom and possibly some appropriate action
taken on the part of ASSU.
I v/ill be glad to meet with you or with Excom
to explain the magnitude of the problem.
Sincerely,
(Signed) RICHARD L. BALCH
Counselor for Men

So it's tunny while if lasts— then not so
funny when they take the phone out and you
can't call Roble, can't call home, can't call the
Administration offices.
It's funny because everyone laughs and
you figure the phone company's got plenty of
money anyway—then the grins disappear
when a bunch of characters in OD coveralls
and wire-cutters hanging out of their pockets
come along and rip out ALL campus public
phones.
But you've heard the story before.
Personally, we don't think Excom itself can
do much in the way of curbing the penny-spin
ners.
You can do a lot more. Just remember: every
time the guy down the hall puts one over on
Mr. Telephone, the chances are increased that
in a week's time or a months' time, there won't
be any campus phones. Then neither of you
will be calling any where.
Think it over. We happen to know that the
phone company — and Mr. Balch — are dead
seiicus about this thing.
