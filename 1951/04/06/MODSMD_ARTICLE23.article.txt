# Remember this Picture?

Last quarter we ran the above picture with an
..editorial. Evidently the edit didn't do much
good, because the ever-present gripe of a
"filthy cellar" was brought up again at Excom
1 ar>t Wednesday night.
New Excom is going to try to put a halt to
â€¢-that messy cellar of which we can he so
proud.
A public address system, no less, is going to
be stationed in the Excom room overlooking the
"filthy cellar." Every time a student fails in his
duty to throw a coffee cup or paper wrapper
into the nearest ashcan, he's going to hear about
it.

Stentorian tones from on high will shout,
"Hey, you, put that cup in the ASH CAN, not
ON THE GROUND." "You" v/ill be singled out
and appropriately embarrassed. If "you" don't
pick up your cup and put it where it belongs,
it's liable to cost "you" a hundred cold stares
and maybe a few unkind words.
At least, that's what Excom's hoping for.
Still, the whole idea sounds a little puerile,
doesn't it?
And yet, how distressingly puerile it is for
"you" to continue cluttering up the Cellar day
after day, when ashcans are there for your
convenience?
Fire with fire, we always say.
