### VIC PALMIERI 
Everybody's talking about CHucl: Taylor's idea for
a switch of duties between the city sports writers and
the Stanford coaching sta/T Seems like a lot of people
around here are looking forward to having a laugh at
the critics' expense.
but why .stop witli the sportswriters? Sure, it'll

be threat to see Leiser and his lads
taking some of their own medi
cine, but how about the Stanford
faculty? The things I've heard
some of them say about college
football would hav« made the
Aour Horsemen switch to don
keys. So why not in the profs
f)h this deal and make the satis
faction complete?

Here's how it would go. The coaches would trade
with the sports writers, according to Chuck's plan,
and the professors would trade with the players.
The only trouble with this idea is that most of the
crowd might flock to the Mem Ami instead to hear
that widely renowned local authority, A. 11, I In -
gasian, lecture on "The Foundations of Marriage,"
or "If She Ain't Clot the Foundation, Why Marry
Her?"
Ilut ol.viously, this plan has tremendous possibilities
for student enjoyment. The sportswiiters would give
the professors hell, the coaches would give the sports
writers heli, and tl. ■ students would give hell to em
all. So. assuming that this idea would meet with cam
pus apf iova! and immediate action on the part of Fx
eom, I have gone to the trouble of selei iini< an All-

Faculty Football learn which will take part in the
t,ame on May 4.

Item No. 2 of the week, in our book, is the latest
word on the Spring Show. They tell me it's all mixed
up with a bottle containing a mysterious fluid which
has a very strange effect on people it makes them
turn blue if they are unchaste.
The dramatic possildltics of this idea intrigue me.
I can see the finale already—a chorus of 50 Kohle
(fit'ls singing, "I Ain't (lot Nuthin' But the Blues."
Better still, "I'm White. Turnin' Blue Over You."
Obviously, this show will be the most successful
Stanford production of all time. They tell me it's all
kinds of fun to work on, too, what with this chastity
test and all. 1 tried out lor it, but they decided 1
didn't have the :lamina. Anyway, they already had u
casting director.

Item No. 2 of the week, in our book, is the latest
word on the Spring Show. They tell me it's all mixed
up with a bottle containing a mysterious fluid which
has a very strange effect on people it makes them
turn blue if they are unchaste.
The dramatic possildltics of this idea intrigue me.
I can see the finale already—a chorus of 50 Kohle
(fit'ls singing, "I Ain't (lot Nuthin' But the Blues."
Better still, "I'm White. Turnin' Blue Over You."
Obviously, this show will be the most successful
Stanford production of all time. They tell me it's all
kinds of fun to work on, too, what with this chastity
test and all. 1 tried out lor it, but they decided 1
didn't have the :lamina. Anyway, they already had u
casting director.

Everybody's talking about CHucl: Taylor's idea for
a switch of duties between the city sports writers and
the Stanford coaching sta/T Seems like a lot of people
around here are looking forward to having a laugh at
the critics' expense.
but why .stop witli the sportswriters? Sure, it'll

be threat to see Leiser and his lads
taking some of their own medi
cine, but how about the Stanford
faculty? The things I've heard
some of them say about college
football would hav« made the
Aour Horsemen switch to don
keys. So why not in the profs
f)h this deal and make the satis
faction complete?

Here's how it would go. The coaches would trade
with the sports writers, according to Chuck's plan,
and the professors would trade with the players.
The only trouble with this idea is that most of the
crowd might flock to the Mem Ami instead to hear
that widely renowned local authority, A. 11, I In -
gasian, lecture on "The Foundations of Marriage,"
or "If She Ain't Clot the Foundation, Why Marry
Her?"
Ilut ol.viously, this plan has tremendous possibilities
for student enjoyment. The sportswiiters would give
the professors hell, the coaches would give the sports
