## Good 'Oldies' Worth Dozen New Pictures 
### ROY HEMMING GEORGE BUCKLEY 
An old-timer traveling along El Camino Real this
week is likely to get a little confused about the date
as he passes the Guild and Park marquees. The pic
tures showing at the two Menlo theaters are as old as
most of the present Stanford student body!
Yet, the Park, with Harold Lloyd's 1932 "Movie
Crazy," and the Guild, with Mttrlene Dietrich's 1929
"Blue Angel." are proving a fact they've already
proved several times last quarter—that a good
"oldie" is worth a dozen or more of today's regular
vintage.
Take "Movie Crazy,"for example. We mentioned in
an earlier column, after a "sneak preview" showing,
that it's hard to beat for sheer laughs. Actually, it's
a comedy that doesn't seem embarrassed to be plain
funny, that puts Harold Lloyd through one slapstick
yituation after another, and —perhaps most significant
of all—that doesn't rely on inane dialogue which
would get lost in the continuous laughter anyway.
The scenes in which Lloyd hops along a gutter try
ing to retrieve a lost shoe, or his attempts to raise the
top of a convertible for a lady in distress, his ridicu
lous movie test, or his involvement with a magician's
coat at a swank party are likely to leave your sides
as limp as Harold Lloyd ever will—which is some
thing by most standards.
Not everything in the picture is hysterical, unfor
tunately. Some of the scenes miss, and Constance

Cummings has learned quite a bit about acting since
1932. Tnere's also a noticeable lack o( background
music, especially in the over-long light scene at the
end. But the good parts make up for these weak
nesses, so we won't quibble.
"The Blue Angel" is a remarkable film in many
ways. Considering its age, it's exceedingly well made
and edited even by today's standards. Marlene Die
trich has slimmed down quite a bit in the intervening
years, but her famous legs and vocal pipes are vividly
there to show how she became an overnight star
through this film. We're also getting a chance to see
the late German actor Emil Jannings (who won the
first Academy Award in 1927) in one of his finest char
acterizations.
These considerations dim, nonetheless, when "The
Blue Angel" is looked at historically. In the per
spective of 1951, the commentary on moral degen
eration in pre-llitler Germany becomes mo;e than
the personal tragedy of the plot's old professor.
On a broader level it shows the dangers involved
when established institutions and traditions fail to ad
just to the times and leave a confused humanity prey
to all sorts of physical cravings—from the sex appeal
of "Lola-Lola" to the superstate of "Der Fuehrer."
You can read a lot more into "The Blue Angel" than
producer von Sternberg or Dietrich or Jannings prob
ably intended in 1929. Maybe that's another reason
why it's such a remarkable picture.

through this film. We're also getting a chance to see
the late German actor Emil Jannings (who won the
first Academy Award in 1927) in one of his finest char
acterizations.
These considerations dim, nonetheless, when "The
Blue Angel" is looked at historically. In the per
spective of 1951, the commentary on moral degen
eration in pre-llitler Germany becomes mo;e than
the personal tragedy of the plot's old professor.
On a broader level it shows the dangers involved
when established institutions and traditions fail to ad
just to the times and leave a confused humanity prey
to all sorts of physical cravings—from the sex appeal
of "Lola-Lola" to the superstate of "Der Fuehrer."
You can read a lot more into "The Blue Angel" than
producer von Sternberg or Dietrich or Jannings prob
ably intended in 1929. Maybe that's another reason
why it's such a remarkable picture.
An old-timer traveling along El Camino Real this
week is likely to get a little confused about the date
as he passes the Guild and Park marquees. The pic
tures showing at the two Menlo theaters are as old as
most of the present Stanford student body!
Yet, the Park, with Harold Lloyd's 1932 "Movie
Crazy," and the Guild, with Mttrlene Dietrich's 1929
"Blue Angel." are proving a fact they've already
proved several times last quarter—that a good
"oldie" is worth a dozen or more of today's regular
vintage.
Take "Movie Crazy,"for example. We mentioned in
an earlier column, after a "sneak preview" showing,
that it's hard to beat for sheer laughs. Actually, it's
a comedy that doesn't seem embarrassed to be plain
funny, that puts Harold Lloyd through one slapstick
yituation after another, and —perhaps most significant
of all—that doesn't rely on inane dialogue which
would get lost in the continuous laughter anyway.
The scenes in which Lloyd hops along a gutter try
ing to retrieve a lost shoe, or his attempts to raise the
top of a convertible for a lady in distress, his ridicu
lous movie test, or his involvement with a magician's
coat at a swank party are likely to leave your sides
as limp as Harold Lloyd ever will—which is some
thing by most standards.
Not everything in the picture is hysterical, unfor
tunately. Some of the scenes miss, and Constance

Cummings has learned quite a bit about acting since
1932. Tnere's also a noticeable lack o( background
music, especially in the over-long light scene at the
end. But the good parts make up for these weak
nesses, so we won't quibble.
"The Blue Angel" is a remarkable film in many
ways. Considering its age, it's exceedingly well made
and edited even by today's standards. Marlene Die
trich has slimmed down quite a bit in the intervening
years, but her famous legs and vocal pipes are vividly
there to show how she became an overnight star
through this film. We're also getting a chance to see
the late German actor Emil Jannings (who won the
first Academy Award in 1927) in one of his finest char
acterizations.
