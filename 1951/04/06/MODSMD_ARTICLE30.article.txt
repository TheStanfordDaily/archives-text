# Enema's Changed Since Army Days
## Ex-GI Recalls War Antics 
### RALPH HANDY 
1 w.<s in Encina yesterday for
line fiist time in almost six years.
There's been quite a change, for
six years ago the Army was in
Encina and I was in the Army
and this is how it was.
Everywhere it was khaki and olive
drab with the little blue and gold
shoulder patches that designated
Uncle Sam's slide-rule Army.
What used to be an orderly room
for "C" Company, SCU 3905, Stan
ford University, is now just another
I dormitory room on the third floor
above the main entrance.
Three youths manage to live there
now iti a comfortable disorder that
would have sent a first lieutenant
named Runyon into nothing less than
a high dudgeon.
"A" Company's lobby orderly room
is now a discarded cashier's office and
bears no trace of the military bustle
that used to be so evident. Miss
Sumner's quarters on the other side
of the lobby were once the offices of
the battalion CO. a likeable young
Armored Force major named Eric
Duckstad.
Only the barber shop and base
ment fountain that used to be a
I'X are still the same.
Encina, Branner, Toyon, and Se
quoia were turned into barracks
when an Army Specialized Training
Program unit was moved into Stan
ford in 1943. ASTP units were com
posed of men taken from the Army
and sent to universities throughout
the country for training as doctors,
linguists, psychologists, and civil,
mechanical, electrical, and Chemical
engineers.
In addition to an accelerated uni
versity curriculum, approximately
tin- equivalent of 2ft units, Army
students were given six hours of
physical training and five hours of
military training per week that in
.eluded a regular Saturday after
noon parade and review in the
Stadium.
The Stanford battalion was broken
down into 12-man academic sections,
and file of soldier-students march
ing to and Irom class were a familiar
sight on Quad.
There was a brighter side, how
ever, for (lie ASTP was a soft touch
and the lucky soldier who got him
self assigned to Stanford found him
self in an institution with better than
three girls to every man.
The Army's weekly all-campus

dances in the Pavilion saw large
groups of stags-in-skirts sizing up
the prospects on the dance floor.
Present civilian high-jinks arc no
more numerous than Army horse
play carried out under far more ad
verse circumstances. Extra-curricu
lar quiet-hour activity always had to
be tuned to a sharply whispered
"Heads up. it's the OD!"
Taking the short-cut up the lire
escape was, then as now, an invita
tion to a dousing, it was great sport
to drop loaded laundry bags down
the stair well, and one group of luck
less Gl's lost their between quarters
seven days' leave when caught by the
officer of the day retrieving a bed
they had dropped out a fourth-floor
window.
There's been quite a change in
timing, too. With the Army, the
early morning welcome rang to a
5:50 whistle blast that meant there
was just 10 minutes to get dressed,
with tie, and be down on what is
now the Encina-Toyon parking lot

for reveille.
Then it was march to breakfast,
and the food got just as many com
plaints as it does now.
By 8, the Army was in class, the
halls had been mopped, rooms
dusted, swept, mopped, extra shoes
shined, and beds made, and Encina
was ready for inspection.
Strictly enforced study hours were
from 7 to 10 p.m. with a 20-minute
break at 8:30 and lights-out at 10:30,
Fridays and Saturdays excepted.
Sign-out sheets were standard pro
cedure and only legitimate campus
destinations were permitted during
study hours.
Not that the rules were always
strictly observed, for the bright
lights of El Camino were always
beckoning. And from the Library
what were a few more steps to the
Cellar?
There's the story of a GI operator
out on a forbidden week night who
took his date to Rossotti's, and

glanced out the window to sec a far
afield OD approaching. Hurriedly
hiding himself in the kitchen, he
watchcd the officer calmly make-out
with the bewildered co-ed.
Following VE-Day, the Army be
gan to curtail its ASTP program. By
autumn quarter, 1945, Encina was the
only dormitory still used by the
Army and the ASTPs had been cut
to 300. Encina found itself split down
the middle with the Army in the east
and civilians in the west end. Two
hundred NROTC midshipmen \vcrc
housed in Toyon.
Continued withdrawals of Army
personnel left only the first two floors
on the west side of Encina to the
Army by November. The last of
Stanford's ASTP trainees left the
campus late in Dec. 1945.
Encina probably heaved a sigh of
relief deep down in its sandstone
heart and gave itself up to its first
love, Joe College. Which is the way
it should he. It's much nicer.


JUST ANOTHER DORMITORYâ€”No longer are strict inspections the routine in Encina as they
were seven years ago. Freshmen are able to live in comfortable disorder, with their beds un
made and their books and papers arranged in numerous piles on their desks with pin-ups above.
