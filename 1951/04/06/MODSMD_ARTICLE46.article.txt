# A 						FIVE-WAY AFFAIR
## Well-rounded Frosh Track Team Opens Season Here 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
Freshman cinder coach 1
Ray Dean will unveil his 1951
track and field squad tomor
row in a five-way meet with
Monterey JC, Menlo JC,
Stockton JC, and Hartnell JC.
The first - year men are fa
vored to win the spikefest,
which will be held on Angell
Field beginning.at 10:30 a.m.
Dean's 33 charges, although
not on a par with last year's
"'greatest ever" frosh team, make
up a well-rounded corps which J
figures to overwhelm most of its I
opposition this season . Biggest
obstacle on the Papooses' victory
trail is the California Bearcub
team, which is the strongest in
history and which could prob
ably give the Berkeley varsity a
stiff battle.
Dean foresees no broken rec
ords this year, but he says that
several of his boys will give a big
boost to the varsity next year.
440 and XXO Tops
The frosh have an excellent
crop of 440 and 880 men. Three
quarter-milers bettered 51 flat as
preps and a trio of half-milers
have hit 2 Hat or better.
Fred George, who sped a 49.8
quarter in practice last week, is
one of the top frosh prospects.
He will be a great help to var
sity coach Jack Weiershauser
next season. George also has a
22.5 220 clocking and will prob
ably try the furlong in some
meets.
Behind George is Bob Bly at
50.8. Basketballer Don Carlson,
who raced a 49.9 440 relay lap
as a high school junior, will
probably limit his activities to
the weights and mile relay.
Watch Out fcr Sanborn
SCIF champ Warren Sanborn
anil Dave Fletcher are the lead
ing half-milers. Sanborn had a
1:57 relay timing in the Comp
ton Invitational last year. Now
recovered from a cold that
plagued him all winter quarter,
he is fast rounding into shape
and should be ready to help out
in either the mile or relay if
needed.
Fletcher, third All - State in
Oregon, has a top mark of 2:00.1,
but looks good for about 1:58 or
better this season. He is also
capable of a 51 440 when called
upon.
Third 880 man is Larry Broe
ren at 2:00.1.

In the weights are Carlson and
footballers Don Harcourt and
Eric Mack. Carlson has a discus
mark of 142 ft. and a shot best of
44 ft. Harcourt has hit 130 ft.
and 45 ft. Mack lias a 134-ft.
discus effort.
Bob Bethke at 14.8 and Gerry
Wood, fourth in last year's SCIF
meet at about 14. G, will handle
high hurdle duties.
Wood, John Steinberg, and
Barry Smith will work the lows.
Erwin Holten, with bests of
10.2 and 22.2, heads a so-so field
of sprinters. Other dash aspir
ants are Doug Rogers, Doug
Glenn, and Karl Vesper.
Bradley, Epperson in Hi»*h Jump
Leading high jump prospects
are Hugh Bradley, 6 ft. Va in.,
and Dave Epperson, 5 ft. 11% in.
Pole vault stock took a big
drop at Christmas time when 12-

ft. 9 - in. jumper Marve Miller
transferred from the Farm to
Pomona. Taking his place will
be Jim Mclndoe at 12 ft. 1 in.
Weakest events seem to be the
mile, two-mile, broad jump, and
javelin, positions where lew if
any candidates have turned out.
Dean has assigned no perma
nent relay team.
