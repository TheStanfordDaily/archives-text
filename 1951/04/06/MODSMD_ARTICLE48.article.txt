# Upset-Minded UCLA Cindermen to Test Gimpy Stanfords in Coliseum Tomorrow
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Stanford's undefeated cinder team, strong in field but weak in
track, will leave for the Southland this morning to meet a much
improved UCLA squad that could easily upset the favored Cards.
Meet Captain Darrell Kreitz, star hurdler, and sophomore sensa
tion, Bob Mathias, will lead the Cards on the windy Westwood

Fred Beck are favored to beat In
dians Drew Terramorse and Joss
Sroggy in the half mile. Mitchell won
last Saturday's triangular meet 880
in 1:57 (i with Deck nut far behind.
Terramorse, who has run I:SU this
year in practice, however, could sur
prise.
The most exciting race of the day
could be in the mile run where
Stanford's John Woolley and
UCLA's Don Hangcn will again Le
pitted against each other. Woollcy
edged Bruins tlangcn and Beck in
a blazing finish in Stanford Sta
dium last year, and the Uclans will
be out for revenge.
Hangen set a new meet record in
the mile run last Saturday when he
toured the four laps in 4:25..

ovul tomorrow afternoon. The versa- I
tile Mathias will enter the shot, dis
cus, and low hurdle events for the |
Indians.
Coach Ducky Drake's Bruins, the j
supposed weak sister of the PCC.
have been improving their marks j
each Saturday, and last week scored
over 100 points and broke several |
meet records in a triangular contest ;
with Santa Barbara and Cal Poly.
The Bruins' upset chances are
greatly enhanced by the fact that
Bob Bryan, Ronnie Buck, Maurice
I'arsons, and George Van lleuscn of
Stanford won't fly south with the
Indians' 26-man traveling squad.
Bryan, Stanford's nationally rated j
low hurdler, still is suffering from a
tore leg, and Coach Jack Weiers
hauser doesn't want to take the
chance of reinsuring his pulled mus
cle in the meet tomorrow.
Sprinter Ronnie Buck, who is in
Law School, and pole vaulter George |
Van Heusen have decided to pass up
the three-day journey in favor of!
their books.
Van Heuscn's absence will leave
Stanford without a single pole vault
entry, since sophomore Duke John- |
son, who cTeared 13 It. last year, is :
ineligible bccause of grades.
It will be interesting to see who j
grabs the third spot in the pole vault, j
since the UCLA prospectus lists only
two Bruin vaulters—Len Eilers and j
Bill Walling.
With sprinter Maurice Parsons un- j
able to make the trip because of sinus
trouble, Stanford is left with but a I
single entry in both sprints—Wilbur |
Taylor.
Because of his 21 . 3-second 220 at |
Fresno last Saturday, Taylor is
slight favorite in the furlong event
over Bruins Boh Work, Rod Rich
ard, and George Brown. On the !
swift Westwood oval. Taylor has an
outside chance of breaking Gay I
Bryan's meet record of 21-Hat set
in 1*149.
In the 100, Taylor may have to take j
a back seat to the swilties Work and
Richard. The Bruin speedsters have J
both been timed at :09.8 already this 1
season, as has tiny Bob Watanabe, j
another strong UCLA sprint entry.
As it stands now, the 440 race is
wide open. Stanford's veteran quar- !
ter miler Cass B!y took only a third j
at Fresno last week while Bruin !
newcomer Jack Sage, a transfer from
Santa Monica City College, won the '
race for UCLA last Saturday in :49 9. j
Sophomore Bill Friedrichs of the In- I
dians and Bill Wright of the Bruins
have both been improving rapidly, J
and cannot be counted out of the j
money.
UCLA veterans Hugh Mitchell and j

In the two-mile, Bruins Marty ;
Donohue with an all-time best ol !
f):-J2.7 is a heavy favorite to take the I
event.
Uclan Jerry Withers and Indians 112
George Griftin and John Kaufman
will light it out l'oi second and third |
[jlaces.
Indian Captain Darrell Kreitz, une j
of the PCC's top hurdlers, is favored ;
to win the high hurdle race over i
teammate Bill Storum and Bruin I
Hugh Wilson. Kreitz was unofficially i
timed at :14.3 in the Biy Meet Relays, I
but did not compete at Fresno last !
Saturday. Wilson's best this year is
: 15.2:
With Bob Bryqn out, Uclan Wilson '
will probably grab first place in the i
lows. Stanford's all-purpose great;
Bob Mathias, who won the lows for !
the Indians at Fresno last Saturday, '

may give Wilson a good battle. Jim
Pollock and Marty Johnson will also
enter for the Indians.
Bruin Coach Ducky Drake can
hope for but a single point in the 1
weight events, and he may have '
trouble getting that point.
Stanford's mighty weight corps
is a virtual "cinch" to sweep the
Khrt with the likes of Lew Davis,
Boh Matliias, and Chuck Hokanson,
uII consistently over 4!) feet.
In the discus, Stanford's Bob Ma
thias (IliO ft. !j v k in.) and lan Reed
(157 ft. 2'/v in.) are far out in front
of the Bruin's best man, footballer
Dave Williams (149 It. 3 in.). Jack
Burke, who has been tossing the
platter consistently in the high 140s,
will be the Indians' third entry.
Since the Cards are limited to three
entries in the PC'C meet, Chuck Ken
fro, who threw 148 ft. G in. at Fresno j
last week, will be unable to make the i
trip.
Stanford's spohomore star Norm
Jiles, at G ft. 3'/4 in., is all by himself
in the high jump. Indians Hon Ailen
(G ft. 1 in.) and Clyde Taylor ((! ft. j
1 in.) will battle with Bruin John
Kalin for second place.
UCLA broad jumper George j
Brown, who broke the national inter
scholastic broad jump record with a
25 ft. 2'.: in. leap two years ago, is 1
favored to beat Stanford's Merrill
Van Sant, who jumped 23 ft. s\j in.
at Fresno last week. Bruin Gerald
Evans and Indian Jeft Macßae have i
identical marks of 22 ft. 3 in. to their
credit.
Stanford's javelin throwers, Dick
Hennigan, Bob Green, and Chuck
Harlow, all hitting around the 170 ft.
murk, may sweep this event for the
Cards. However, Uclan John Sende, i
who hit 178 ft. 3 in. last season, may ;
break his slump this season and sur
prise the Bruins.
