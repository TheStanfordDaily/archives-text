STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA
• plan* ahead to serve you better


Mrs. Henry Lincoln, housewife in Boise, Idaho, asks: "Doyou have to be in
all parts of the oil business? Why don'tyou just produce or refine,andgive other com-

parties a chance to do the transporting, selling, etc?"



Why all parts? Example:
in Oregon, severe winters
used to delay fuel oil deliv
eries. Here was a need.


To meet the need, Standard
looked to the undeveloped
Rangely oil field, fiOO miles
away in Colorado.


(letting crude out of new
wells, refining it, delivering
it to users—called for a fully
integrated operation.


To move the oil, Standard
laid a 182-raile line to Salt
Lake City crossing Uinta
Mts. at. 9,560 feet. Here


A new refinery wiih built.To
keep costs down, it had to
run steadily . . . have con
stant flow of product. So—


Another pipe line who built
into the Northwest to de
liver refined products . . .
plentiful in any weather.


We now serve t his area well.
To do the job Standard
needed all its size, integrat
ed skills and capital.
