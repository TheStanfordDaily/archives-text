# No 'Milk' At Faust Class

### JOHN BUSH 
"There must be some misunder
standing here," tlie professor said.
"We arc NOT going to serve beer in
I his class. Nor will we play Othel
lo."
Professor Henry Blauth has made
a major impact on student philoso
phy—that is beyond argument. He
expcctcd about 40 persons to enroll
in his coursc in Goethe's Faust;
something like !)0 showed up at the
first meeting of the class Wednes
day. Textual criticism is goin:* to
suffer, he feels.
Hcrr Blauth's star has risen stead
ily since he began a scries of semi
quarterly "seminars' at the Bier
garten Rossotti several years ago.
Sponsored by Dcutschcverein — the
German Club • those Rabelaisian
bouts have become famous for song?
from Germany, Shakespeare from
Herr Blauth, and tawny wisdom
from a quart bottle.
It would be unfair to Goethe, the
universal genius, to say without
reservation that his Faust is not the
chief bait on the book of Germanic
Languages, course A-75; indeed, it
would be untrue. But a sense of
realism impels one to make a four
mile trip, westward, to find the full
explanation.
The next seminar will be an~
nounced soon. Furthermore, the
Bookstore has doubled the Goethe
order.
