# Stanford Nine Faces Cal Today
## Broncos Here On Saturday 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Stanford's unpredictable In
dians meet an equally unpre
dictable Cal nine here this after
noon at 3:15 in what will be the
first home league game for the
locals.
So far, the defending CIBA champs
have demonstrated a lot of potential,
and with hurler Joe Chez back in
the breach, the Indians may pick
themselves up of the deck after their
twin KO at USC.
Cal's nine last year acted more like
possums than Bears when meeting
the Cards and dropped three straight.
This year, however, they've picked
themselves to capture the CIBA
crown, and judging from the 8 to 1
mauling they gave a good USF team,
they may do it. Stanford will be their
initial target, as Cal was idle last
weekend.
Oscnhailgh to Pitch
Tog Osenbaugh will throw the first
ball in the general direction of home
plate for the locals, and Bill Nishita
or Andy Stagnaro will do likewise for
the Bears. Nishita, from far-oil Ha
waii, beat Bob Thollander of USF, a
feat which only the Oakland Oaks
could duplicate.. Stagnaro is a junk
baller with good control, but last
year's Indians had little respect for
the veteran righthander and beat
him twice.
Tomorrow at 1:30 the Cards will
take on double trouble in Santa
Clara when they tangle with the
Broncos there in a double header.
Coach Patty Cot troll's visitors have
always been a Stanford nemesis.
Last year all hurler Hal Toso had to
was toss his glove in the ring and the
Stanford's began talking about the
next game. However, Toso, his
brother Harv, and 10 other Bronco
lettermen have departed from the
Mission school, leaving Cottrcll with
a host of green hands.
Few Brnnco Vols
Only veterans left are Andy Har
rington at short, Frank Lico in ri'dit,
