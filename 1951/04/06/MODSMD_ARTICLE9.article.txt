# Stern Unfolds Violin Mastery
## 
### ROY HEMMING 
The advance nolrecs this week ,
: emphasized the"mastery" we could
cxpect from violinist Isaac Stern
at the third concert in this season's <
; ASSU series.
Last night in the Memorial Audi-
I torium, Mr. Stern proved eonclu
j sivcly for local audiences how very j
much he really is the master of his I
j instrument.
For two hours, Mr. Stern brought
forth unusually expressive music—
most of it. primarily romantic,
played with an eloquence and taste
I that was also an index to his genu
ine musicianship.
It seemed to take him most of the
1 first, movement of Brahms' CI Ma-
I jor Sonata to warm up, but from |
there on the melodic line assumed a j
I form not unlike the physical ap
pearance Mr. Stern presented on I
the stage broad yet sensitive.
In the "Recitative" of the Cesar j
Franck Sonata in A Major, Mr. j
Stern's tone readied its finest point l
j in the evening—beautifully shaded
j and colored, filled with all the nu
! ances he desired.
Vieutemps' Concerto No. 5, a ron
i do by Mozart-Kreisler, Szymanow
ski's "La Fontaine d'Arethuse," Sa
rasate's "Caprice Basque," and the
| two encores, "Tschaikovski's "Valse
j Sentimentalc" and the Dinicu-Hei
fetz "Hora S toccata," were all
played with perception, excellent
( tone, and, as said before, complete
I technical mastery.
