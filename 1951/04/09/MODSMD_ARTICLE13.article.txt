# Honor Code Infringers Suspended
## 
### 
After a five-hour smoke-filled
session Thursday night and an
other meeting over the week
end, the Council for Student
Control found three students —
two women and one man —
guilty of violating the honor
code.
The students, who were found
guilty of copying sections of their
final paper in an English literature
course last quarter, were given an
"F" in the course.
They were also suspended for one
quarter, but this part of the sentence
was suspended because of the pecu
liar circumstances in the case. Among
these were the degree of premedita
tion and intent on the part of the stu
dents, and the arrangement of the
coursc.
The violations wore brought to the
Council by the professor. She was
struck by the strangely nineteenth
century style in one paper and traced
sentences back to a. well-known
critic. The professor said she had
thoroughly stressed the fact that no
outside reading was permitted and
that all papers were to be the result
of "original thinking."
The Council placed the paper side
by side with the book and found sen
tences and even lists of adjectives
which were identical.
In the same batch of papers, the
professor found two written on the
sHtnc character in the same play. In
both papers there were parafjraphs
which were almost completely the
same.
Council decided that the papers
were not copied from each other.
Instead, both students had used a
common source—the introduction to
the play in a book that was used as
a textbook by about one-fifth of the
students in the course.
In both papers, a small portion of
the thoughts and language were the
students' own. There were sentences
and phrases which were identical,
word for word, with the introduction.
Large portions of both papers were
paraphrased from the introduction.
At the meeting of the Council for
Student Control, Dick Clegg, chair
man of Men's Council, stressed that
"not following the instructions of a
tcachcr is a violation of the honor
code."
Wayne Alley, honor code chair
man, said the honor code included
"anything used as a basis of grading
in a course." The main things which
this includes, he said, are papers, re
ports, and examinations.
