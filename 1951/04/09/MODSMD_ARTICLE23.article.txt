# Deferring the 'Bright Boys'
## 
### 
Words, words, words—crowding the nation's
editorial pages —and most of them about the
"bright boys" (lately synonymous with
"wealthy sons"), who are going to sit back and
take it easy while those "not so fortunate" fight
«i war.
The new college deferment regulation has
produced a flurry of such biting pronounce
ments.
The only thing is that those who condemn the
collegiate "draft dodgers" so roundly—fail to
tell us what they would do to fill this country's
obvious need for engineers, scientists, doctors,
dentists, trained technicians, and well-educated
men.
Evidently the "experts" would have all of us
go into the army now. Then they would turn
the universities and colleges into army camps
and spend additional millions training draftees
to be engineers, scientists, doctors, etc. Thus,
it would seem, they would transfer to the fed
eral government a function the private and
state institutions have been handling quite effi
ciently up to now—and will continue to handle,
if given the chance.
But even if this were the proposed solution
the "experts" have in mind, they fail to tell us
so.
Rather, they point to what they call the in
consistency between "leadership" and "an
education," informing us, in other words, that
not all well-educated men are, per se, leaders.
They tell us the new deferment program ex
cludes from military service those who have
book-learning ability—but neglects to set up
criteria for deferring those with leadership

ability. 1 , >
To bolster their arguments, many writers
point ape-fashion to four names: Alger Hiss,
Whittaker Chambers, Klaus Fuchs, and Julien
Wadleigh; men who were supposedly well
educated, but who were either convicted or
suspected of betrayal.
How these writers can take iour men —or
even a hundred—out of the thousands who
have graduated from college, and use their
case-histories as indictments against the kind
of leadership-training a man gets in college,
seems beyond the principles of sound rea
soning. The scales are actually so out of bal
ance. the examples so isolated!
Most important of all, the editorial and maga
zine contributors don't say anything about the
duration of the present emergency.
If they feel the conflict with Russia is to be
short-lived—ror if they believe there is no such
thing as a conflict with Russia —then we would
appreciate their telling us so, and we too would
be in favor of drafting everyone NOW to "get
it over with" in Korea.
But if this is to be a long-term emergency —a
30-year war, a war of ideologies as well as guns
—this nation will want and need a constant
flow of trained, technical personnel, person
nel which is right now lacking. Still, the writ
ers fail to include this consideration when talk
ing of the new deferment law.
If they did, they might come to the conclu
sion that all of us, including college men (after
completion of studies), WILL SERVE and BE
OBLIGATED TO SERVE in the armed forces
just like everyone else.

cludes from military service those who have
book-learning ability—but neglects to set up
criteria for deferring those with leadership

ability. 1 , >
To bolster their arguments, many writers
point ape-fashion to four names: Alger Hiss,
Whittaker Chambers, Klaus Fuchs, and Julien
Wadleigh; men who were supposedly well
educated, but who were either convicted or
suspected of betrayal.
How these writers can take iour men —or
even a hundred—out of the thousands who
have graduated from college, and use their
case-histories as indictments against the kind
of leadership-training a man gets in college,
seems beyond the principles of sound rea
soning. The scales are actually so out of bal
ance. the examples so isolated!
Most important of all, the editorial and maga
zine contributors don't say anything about the
duration of the present emergency.
If they feel the conflict with Russia is to be
short-lived—ror if they believe there is no such
thing as a conflict with Russia —then we would
appreciate their telling us so, and we too would
be in favor of drafting everyone NOW to "get
it over with" in Korea.
But if this is to be a long-term emergency —a
30-year war, a war of ideologies as well as guns
—this nation will want and need a constant
flow of trained, technical personnel, person
nel which is right now lacking. Still, the writ
ers fail to include this consideration when talk
ing of the new deferment law.
If they did, they might come to the conclu
sion that all of us, including college men (after
completion of studies), WILL SERVE and BE
OBLIGATED TO SERVE in the armed forces
just like everyone else.
Words, words, words—crowding the nation's
editorial pages —and most of them about the
"bright boys" (lately synonymous with
"wealthy sons"), who are going to sit back and
take it easy while those "not so fortunate" fight
«i war.
The new college deferment regulation has
produced a flurry of such biting pronounce
ments.
The only thing is that those who condemn the
collegiate "draft dodgers" so roundly—fail to
tell us what they would do to fill this country's
obvious need for engineers, scientists, doctors,
dentists, trained technicians, and well-educated
men.
Evidently the "experts" would have all of us
go into the army now. Then they would turn
the universities and colleges into army camps
and spend additional millions training draftees
to be engineers, scientists, doctors, etc. Thus,
it would seem, they would transfer to the fed
eral government a function the private and
state institutions have been handling quite effi
ciently up to now—and will continue to handle,
if given the chance.
But even if this were the proposed solution
the "experts" have in mind, they fail to tell us
so.
Rather, they point to what they call the in
consistency between "leadership" and "an
education," informing us, in other words, that
