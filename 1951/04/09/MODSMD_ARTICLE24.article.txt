It follows a pattern in a way. This foreign language
requirement. When you enter Stanford, you are told
"it is required" that you have a second-year reading
knowledge in some language. You suggest the Eng
lish language. They smile and tell you they have that
trap all arranged with English 1-A, 2-A, and maybe
Bonehead-1. You have your choice of Portuguese,
Russian, Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese, French,
or Chinese. You recall something about having taken
Spanish or a language that sounded like it in high
school. So you take a placement test. It sure seems
funny how much you can forget in a few years or over
a summer. It seems funny how much you didn't learn
in high school.
You tried in the placement test. But . . . well,
anyway you'll KKALLY learn the language this
time.
You start with Spanish 1. The first day of class the
teacher, who speaks broken English and smiles too
much, begins to joke—in Spanish. Half the class is
convulsed with laughter. You wonder what is up until
some fellow behind you (he looks like a junior or
senior) says, "This is really the deal. Flunk that place
ment test and then float through a couple of quarters
of straight 'A'." You wonder what the curve is going
to look like. You consider what your place on the
curve will look like, too. You try.
A language course is a demanding mistress. She
keeps your nose to the books relentlessly. She keeps
you up nights with her nagging. She is the one sub
ject that cannot be denied for just one day, just one
date. So you kiss-off everything and get the Spanish

done.
Every night, sleep or not, you translate mid-Vic
torian stories about gallant heroes and blushing, shel
tered heroines. Once in a while comes a laugh but it
never seems quite as funny at one o'clock in the morn
ing when you had to look it up word-by-word. And
then it's not really funny until you understand the
idiom. In class the next morning the professor laughs
until tears roll down his ruddy cheeks. So do the
question-asking girls who sit in the front row. The
curve climbs even higher. You try.
Five quarters later you emerge from Memorial
Auditorium. The morning sun looks fat and gaudy
to your swollen eyes. "Thank God, I'm through with
Spanish," you say. "Hope I got a 'C'." you add fer
vently.
It's all done. You officially have a second-year
reading knowledge in a foreign language. It might
have taken you five quarters. In money it may cost
you $133.33 just to acquire that knowledge. But it's
all done.
Of course you haven't advanced far enough to
read Spanish novels. Nor do the Spanish newspa
pers particularly interest you. When you get a
Spanish station on the radio, the words just don't
seem to make sense—like the jukes the professor told
the first day of Spanish class. But you're done, all
done. And you set about the pleasurable task of
forgetting, like putting a bad dream out of mind.
It's a pattern in a way, this foreign language re
quirement.
It's kind of funny. And it's kind of .sad, too.
