military training is absolutely in
dispensable for U.S. defense and the
"possible prevention" of World

The adviser to Presidents warned
on the eve of the House vote on a
draft-UMT bill that lasting peace
"becomes impossible" without UMT
and that any delay in enacting it
will "increase the risk of war."
