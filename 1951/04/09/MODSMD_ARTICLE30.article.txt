"Six Characters in Search of an
Author" is a tragedy within a philo
sophical comedy, written by the
Italian Luigi Pirandello. Pirandello
presents the question as to which is
truer reality: human beings or the
personages of an art creation.

The comedy part of the play is
concerned witli a group of actors
rehearsing for a play. Tragedy en
ters with a group of characters who
want their story written down. They
had been created by a playwright
who did not dare to finish their tale,
because of the tragic elements in it.
Pirandello himself believed in the
characters he had created to such
an extent that he held conferences
with them every Sunday morning
from 7 to 10. He believed that after
he created them, his characters dic
tated how he should write their
plots.
