# Papoose Nine Triumphs 11-1
## 
### 
The lrosh baseballers put on their
best show of the season Saturday I
morning as they slaughtered Com- j
merce High, 11 to 1, for their sev
enth straight win.
As usual, the pitching was air
tight, and the defense was spar
kling, but for the first time this
year the frosh showed a little power
at the plate, as they raked the Com
merce pitchers fro 15 hits.
The frosh showed their greatest
offensive splurge of the year in the
sixth when Don De Long, Warren
Goodrich, Clark Nelson, Ray
Swarts, and Bill Moffett smashed |
ringing hits, as six runs trooped
across the plate.
Truckhorse Phil Page notched his
fourth win as he pitched four-hit, |
one-run baseball for five innings. [
Change-up artist Don De Long took
over in the sixth and allowed but |
one more bingle in the final four
frames.
The win was a going-away pres- |
ent to Bill Allhouse, who piloted ;
the yearlings to their early wins.
Allhouse moves over to the varsity
to replace Dutch Fehring who will
help with spring football. It is a
straight player trade with no cash
involved.
Bob Burnett will now guide the
frosh baseballers, who tangle with
Paly High tomorrow across the
road.
