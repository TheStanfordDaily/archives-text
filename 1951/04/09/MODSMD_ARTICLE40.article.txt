# Indian Cinder Squad Upset at Westwood
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
UCLA's upset-minded tracksters, with come-through perform
ances in nearly every track event, outdistanced an "air-groggy"
group of Stanford cindermen, 69 to 61, on the Westwood oval
Saturday.
The victorious Bruins had a one-two punch in every race from

the 100-yard dash to the two-mile,
which was too much for Stanford's
strong field and hurdle corps to
overcome.
The Uclans were led to victory by
Captain Hugh Mitchell, much-im
proved middle distance runner,
whose blazing finish won the 440
in 49.7 and the 880 in 1:56 fiat.
An extended three - hour plane
trip to Los Angeles, which included
an hour's search for the missing
Southwest Airways plane, made
several of the runners sick and hin
dered the Card cause immensely.
The Indians were also without the
services of Bob Bryan, Ronnie Buck,
George Van Heusen, and Maurice
ParsoKs.
However, even in defeat many
Stanford performers turned in
very creditable efforts. Sophomore
Bob Simon, although placing third
in the mile, ran the four laps in
4:23.8, beating his previous best
mark by three seconds.
Powerful running Bill Storum
breezed over the high hurdles in
14.G, his best mark to date this sea
son, and then came roaring back
with a :48.5-second lap in the re
lay.
Veteran broad jumper Merritt
Van Sant, who has been plagued
with a tricky hamstring muscle, had
the best day of his career when he
beat the 24-foot broad jump mark
four times. Despite his efforts, Van
Sant's best jump fell one-half foot

i
short of Uclan George Brown's win
! ning 24-ft. 9%-in. leap.
Sophomore ace Bob Mathias
bettered 50 feet in the shot for the
first time when he heaved the IG
pound ball 50 ft. 4 :i k in. lie also
won the discus with a toss of 15!{
, ft. 10 in. and the low hurdles ill
24 seconds flat.
In the latter race Mathias was
running even with UCLA's arte
"hurdler Bob Wilson when the Bruin
[Took a bad spill on the final barrier.

UCLA's upset-minded tracksters, with come-through perform

group of Stanford cindermen, 69 to 61, on the Westwood oval
Saturday.
The victorious Bruins had a one-two punch in every race from

the 100-yard dash to the two-mile,
which was too much for Stanford's
strong field and hurdle corps to
overcome.
The Uclans were led to victory by
Captain Hugh Mitchell, much-im

UCLA's upset-minded tracksters, with come-through perform
ances in nearly every track event, outdistanced an "air-groggy"
group of Stanford cindermen, 69 to 61, on the Westwood oval
Saturday.
The victorious Bruins had a one-two punch in every race from

the 100-yard dash to the two-mile,
which was too much for Stanford's
strong field and hurdle corps to
overcome.
The Uclans were led to victory by
Captain Hugh Mitchell, much-im
proved middle distance runner,
whose blazing finish won the 440
in 49.7 and the 880 in 1:56 fiat.
An extended three - hour plane
trip to Los Angeles, which included
an hour's search for the missing
Southwest Airways plane, made
several of the runners sick and hin
dered the Card cause immensely.
The Indians were also without the
services of Bob Bryan, Ronnie Buck,
George Van Heusen, and Maurice
ParsoKs.
However, even in defeat many
Stanford performers turned in
very creditable efforts. Sophomore
Bob Simon, although placing third
in the mile, ran the four laps in
4:23.8, beating his previous best
mark by three seconds.
Powerful running Bill Storum
breezed over the high hurdles in
14.G, his best mark to date this sea
son, and then came roaring back
with a :48.5-second lap in the re
lay.
Veteran broad jumper Merritt
Van Sant, who has been plagued
with a tricky hamstring muscle, had
the best day of his career when he
beat the 24-foot broad jump mark
four times. Despite his efforts, Van
Sant's best jump fell one-half foot

i
short of Uclan George Brown's win
! ning 24-ft. 9%-in. leap.
Sophomore ace Bob Mathias
bettered 50 feet in the shot for the
first time when he heaved the IG
pound ball 50 ft. 4 :i k in. lie also
won the discus with a toss of 15!{
, ft. 10 in. and the low hurdles ill
24 seconds flat.
In the latter race Mathias was

"hurdler Bob Wilson when the Bruin
[Took a bad spill on the final barrier.
