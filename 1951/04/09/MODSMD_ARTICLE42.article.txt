# Diplomat Says New Indonesian Nation Stands for World Peace, Conciliation
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo, ambas
sador from Indonesia, asserted
the foreign policy of his country
as an independent stand for
world peace, based on friendly
relations with every country of
the world, at a seminar held Fri
day in Hoover Library.
Speaking hefore a group of about
50 students and professors, the am
bassador explained that the one
year-old republic cannot take sides
in any international conflict if it is
to survive.
After four years of warfare and
another five years of struggle for
independence, Indonesia has just
begun on the road to rehabilitation.
During the fight against the Dutch
for independence, the Indonesians,
said the ambassador, destroyed ev
erything which could he an advan
tage to the enemy, such as factories,
schools, and other material equip
ment. "We have to build them all
over again," he said.
Economic Situation
Behind the problem of rehabili
tation is the peculiar economic sit
uation which faces the new nation.
Because of their rich supply of such
valuable - resources as rubber and
tea, they arc now exporting more
than they are importing.
The ambassador considers thi.s
unfortunate since there is little use
in having money if you can't buy
anything. He explained the diffi
culty in importing consumer goods
that the Indonesians need due to the
present tension in the world.
Indonesia has an agricultural
economy, but the ambassador ex
pressed his -hope for a diversified
economy which would afford the
building up of industries.
Questions Answered
Dr. Sastroamidjojo answered the
questions — some of which were
double - barreled — of the students
and professors frankly and to the
point.
Emphasizing that the prime req
uisite for the successful rehabilita
tion of Indonesia is peace, the am
bassador explained why Indonesia
has joined the neutral policy of the
12 Asiatic and Arabic countries
which believe that a peaceful solu
tion to the East - West conflict «s
possible and necessary.
"If we take sides," the doctor said,
"our dreams of independence would
come to a disastrous end." The am
bassador said that Indonesia's stand
was not one of appeasement; he
believes that it is not too late to
conciliate in a peaceful manner.
In answer to a question of Com

munist infiltration in his counti,>,
the doctor said thai the Indonesians
would never «ivc up their treas
ured independence; that there is a
Communist party as in all of the
South Asian countries, hut that il
ranks far behind the major Islamic
party and the Nationalist and So
cialist parties.
Indo-China Relations
When asked about the trouble in
Indo-China, neighbor of Indonesia,
the ambassador replied that his
country's official stand was one of
neutrality. But he pointed out that
there were factions in Indonesia
which favored the fight against
French colonization, and which
were expressive of the Indonesians'
distaste for colonization of any kind.
In regard to west New Guinea,
which is still under Dutch control
despite continuous attempts by the
Indonesians to incorporate it into
their republic, the ambassador said
there was only one solution west
New Guinea must belong to the re
public for political, not racial rea
sons.
Films Shown
The ambassador answered ques
tions between and following the
showing of two films on Indonesia.
The films showed Indonesia as a
growing and populous group of is
lands, producing 20 per cent of the

world's tin in addition to rubber,
tea, oil, tapioca, sugar cane, and
coconuts.
The one-year-old republic is the
.sixth largest nation in the world, the
third richest in natural resources,
j and the newest member of the UN.
j Dr. Sastroamidjojo described the
| slow but steady progress in the
I building up of educational facilities,
! the development of a national Indo
nesian language, and the rehabilita
tion of the country as a whole.
Accompanying the ambassador
were his wife and a former Stan
ford instructor in Indonesian lan
guagc, Darmanto, who is now on the
ambassador's staff. They have vis
ited the West Coast to inspect a
j squadron of Indonesian flyers being
I trained at Bakcrsfield.

Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo, ambas
sador from Indonesia, asserted
the foreign policy of his country
as an independent stand for
world peace, based on friendly
relations with every country of
the world, at a seminar held Fri
day in Hoover Library.
Speaking hefore a group of about
50 students and professors, the am
bassador explained that the one
year-old republic cannot take sides
in any international conflict if it is
to survive.
After four years of warfare and
another five years of struggle for
independence, Indonesia has just
begun on the road to rehabilitation.
During the fight against the Dutch
for independence, the Indonesians,
said the ambassador, destroyed ev
erything which could he an advan
tage to the enemy, such as factories,
schools, and other material equip
ment. "We have to build them all
over again," he said.
Economic Situation
Behind the problem of rehabili
tation is the peculiar economic sit
uation which faces the new nation.
Because of their rich supply of such
valuable - resources as rubber and
tea, they arc now exporting more
than they are importing.
The ambassador considers thi.s
unfortunate since there is little use
in having money if you can't buy
anything. He explained the diffi
culty in importing consumer goods
that the Indonesians need due to the
present tension in the world.
Indonesia has an agricultural
economy, but the ambassador ex
pressed his -hope for a diversified
economy which would afford the
building up of industries.
Questions Answered
Dr. Sastroamidjojo answered the
questions — some of which were
double - barreled — of the students
and professors frankly and to the
point.
Emphasizing that the prime req
uisite for the successful rehabilita
tion of Indonesia is peace, the am
bassador explained why Indonesia
has joined the neutral policy of the
12 Asiatic and Arabic countries
which believe that a peaceful solu
tion to the East - West conflict «s
possible and necessary.
"If we take sides," the doctor said,
"our dreams of independence would
come to a disastrous end." The am
bassador said that Indonesia's stand
was not one of appeasement; he
believes that it is not too late to
conciliate in a peaceful manner.
In answer to a question of Com

munist infiltration in his counti,>,
the doctor said thai the Indonesians
would never «ivc up their treas
ured independence; that there is a
Communist party as in all of the
South Asian countries, hut that il
ranks far behind the major Islamic
party and the Nationalist and So
cialist parties.
Indo-China Relations
When asked about the trouble in
Indo-China, neighbor of Indonesia,
the ambassador replied that his
country's official stand was one of
neutrality. But he pointed out that
there were factions in Indonesia
which favored the fight against
French colonization, and which
were expressive of the Indonesians'
distaste for colonization of any kind.
In regard to west New Guinea,
which is still under Dutch control
despite continuous attempts by the
Indonesians to incorporate it into
their republic, the ambassador said
there was only one solution west
New Guinea must belong to the re
public for political, not racial rea
sons.
Films Shown
The ambassador answered ques
tions between and following the
showing of two films on Indonesia.
The films showed Indonesia as a
growing and populous group of is
lands, producing 20 per cent of the

world's tin in addition to rubber,
tea, oil, tapioca, sugar cane, and
coconuts.
The one-year-old republic is the
.sixth largest nation in the world, the
third richest in natural resources,
j and the newest member of the UN.
j Dr. Sastroamidjojo described the
| slow but steady progress in the
I building up of educational facilities,
! the development of a national Indo
nesian language, and the rehabilita
tion of the country as a whole.

Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo, ambas
sador from Indonesia, asserted
the foreign policy of his country
as an independent stand for
world peace, based on friendly
relations with every country of
the world, at a seminar held Fri
day in Hoover Library.
Speaking hefore a group of about
50 students and professors, the am
bassador explained that the one
year-old republic cannot take sides
in any international conflict if it is
to survive.
After four years of warfare and
another five years of struggle for
independence, Indonesia has just
begun on the road to rehabilitation.
During the fight against the Dutch
for independence, the Indonesians,
said the ambassador, destroyed ev
erything which could he an advan
tage to the enemy, such as factories,
schools, and other material equip
ment. "We have to build them all
over again," he said.
Economic Situation
Behind the problem of rehabili
tation is the peculiar economic sit
uation which faces the new nation.
Because of their rich supply of such
valuable - resources as rubber and
tea, they arc now exporting more
than they are importing.
The ambassador considers thi.s
unfortunate since there is little use
in having money if you can't buy
anything. He explained the diffi
culty in importing consumer goods
that the Indonesians need due to the
present tension in the world.
Indonesia has an agricultural
economy, but the ambassador ex
pressed his -hope for a diversified
economy which would afford the
building up of industries.
Questions Answered
Dr. Sastroamidjojo answered the
questions — some of which were
double - barreled — of the students
and professors frankly and to the
point.
Emphasizing that the prime req
uisite for the successful rehabilita
tion of Indonesia is peace, the am
bassador explained why Indonesia
has joined the neutral policy of the
12 Asiatic and Arabic countries
which believe that a peaceful solu
tion to the East - West conflict «s
possible and necessary.
"If we take sides," the doctor said,
"our dreams of independence would
come to a disastrous end." The am
bassador said that Indonesia's stand
was not one of appeasement; he
believes that it is not too late to
conciliate in a peaceful manner.
In answer to a question of Com

munist infiltration in his counti,>,
the doctor said thai the Indonesians
would never «ivc up their treas
ured independence; that there is a
Communist party as in all of the
South Asian countries, hut that il
ranks far behind the major Islamic
party and the Nationalist and So
cialist parties.
Indo-China Relations
When asked about the trouble in
Indo-China, neighbor of Indonesia,
the ambassador replied that his
country's official stand was one of
neutrality. But he pointed out that
there were factions in Indonesia
which favored the fight against
French colonization, and which
were expressive of the Indonesians'
distaste for colonization of any kind.
In regard to west New Guinea,
which is still under Dutch control
despite continuous attempts by the
Indonesians to incorporate it into
their republic, the ambassador said
there was only one solution west
New Guinea must belong to the re
public for political, not racial rea
sons.
Films Shown
The ambassador answered ques
tions between and following the
showing of two films on Indonesia.
The films showed Indonesia as a
growing and populous group of is
lands, producing 20 per cent of the

world's tin in addition to rubber,
tea, oil, tapioca, sugar cane, and
coconuts.
The one-year-old republic is the
.sixth largest nation in the world, the
third richest in natural resources,
j and the newest member of the UN.
