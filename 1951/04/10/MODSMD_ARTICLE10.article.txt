# Students to Hear Far East Experts
## 
### 
"U.S. policy makers are hoping for the best and preparing for
the worst," according to Dr. Claude Buss, who spent spring vaca
tion in Washington, D.C. The Far East expert was impressed with
the widespread conviction among the capital crowd that the year
ahead is THE critical year in determining whether we shall have

world war or pcace.
"There is a qreat deal of fire at
present, and too much inflammable
material," Buss stated. He feels that
the danger of war is always immi
nent because it is the small inci
dents and not the great conflicts
of reason that actually start wars.
"We arc proceeding on the as
sumption that present, world inci
dents are steps in a carefully plan
ned Russian time table. Only the
strength of UN resistance can de
termine the pace and scope of their
future plans for the world," Buss
said.
As a speaker in the Friday af
ternoon session of the Stanford
Student Conference Friday and
Saturday, Buss feels that the
Stanford student has done a "trc
mendous iob nf keeping his head
and poise in the crisis."
He points out that we never know
how much tension is normal and
that we will have to get used to
making crisis and tension an ever
present factor in our future plans.
Another Far Fast expert and
foremost authority on Russian
historv and polities. Dr. Harold
Fisher of the Hoover Institute and
Library, will also discuss U.S.
peace policy at the Conference
Friday afternoon.
Dr. Fisher was an officer of the
American Relief Administration fol
lowing World War I, and has a first
hand knowledge of Central and
Eastern Europe and Russia.
He was one of 100 American edu
cators, writers, diplomats, and sci
entists whom the Nazis intended to
arrest and liquidate immediately
after they had defeated the United
States.
In addition to his academic work,
Dr. Fisher has been an editorial
writer for the Washington, D.C.,
Times-Herald and a news analyst
for the Columbia Broadcasting Com
pany and the National Broadcasting
Company.
