# UMT Plans Postponed By House

### 
WASHINGTON, April 9 (UP)
— The House Armed Services
Committee today dropped ef
forts to write a Universal Mili
tary Training Program into law
now and backed away from
plans to defer all "bright" col
lege sudents.
Faced with strong bipartisan oppo
sition to enactment now of a standby
UMT program for use after the pres
ent, crisis, the committee voted unan
imously to support an amendment to
the pending draft bill virtually di
vorcing it from the draft issue.
The action appeared to clear the
way for approval this week of other
provisions of the bill to lower the
draft age from 18 to IBV2, extend the
term of service from 21 to 26 months
and tighten deferments for husbands
without children.
Without taking a vote, the commit
tee also was said to have approved
1 informally an amendment to give
i draft boards the last word on defer-
I ring college students, regardless of
I results of "intelligence tests" ordered
by President Truman.
Under the amendment, Congress
merely would agree to consider
recommendations to be made later
by a five-man UMT commission
composed of three civilians and two
military men.
Congress would be committed to
consider such a commission's recom
mendations, to he made within six
months of its appointment. Rut UMT
woulrl not go into effect until spe
cifically decreed by Congress in a
new and separate law.
Rep. Paul J. Kilday, D.. Tex., who
earlier planned to offer an amend
ment to block the college tests, said
under his revised plan the tests
would go ahead but results would
only he "advisory." In other words
each draft board still would have the
final word on deferment.
Foes of UMT hailed the commis
i sion decision as a victory, but Chair
man Carl Vinson, D., Ga., denied it
means scuttling of the training idea.
"This, in my opinion, absolutely as-
I sures that within a year there will be
; a plan for universal military training
j approved by Congress."
