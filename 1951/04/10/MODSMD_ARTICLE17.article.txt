# Johnny Goes Walking Home

CAMP ROBERTS, April 9 (UP)—
i Fourteen-year-old John J. Sabatini,
who enlisted in the Army because
he "got the itch to do something,"
unhappily accepted an honorable
discharge today.
The six-foot, boy's military career
was cut short, at least for the pres
ent. when his father, John C. Saba
tini, discovered John was taking
basic training here. The elder Sa
hatini flew here Saturday to take
his wandering son home to Engle
| wood, N.J.
Young Sabatini first pleaded for
! a chance to stay in the service.
I When he learned this was impos
| sible, he said:
"I guess I'll follow my dad's ad
| vice and go back to school—to a
military school if I can. Hi en may
be I can get hack into the Army
! when I graduate.
"I like Army life. I want to make
jit my career."
The youngster was considered by
officers and fellow members of the
! Seventh Armored Division's 23rd
Armored Infantry Battalion to be a
I "darned good soldier."
