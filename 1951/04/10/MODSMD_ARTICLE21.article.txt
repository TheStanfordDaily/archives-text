# Birkmeyer to Discuss Raphael In Tonight's Series Program
## 
### TOM NEVILLE 
Dr. Karl Birkmeyer, a special
ist in Renaissance art who began
his career by studying engineer
ing, and a Ph.D. who was a buck
private during the last war in
Germany, will make his first
public appearance before a
Stanford audience tonight.
Dr. Birkmcyer will lecture on
"Raphael: Classicism and Christian
J Art" as a part, of the Tuesday Eve
! ning Series at 7:.'M) in Memorial Hall.
The program is open to the public
without charge.
Before ho came to Stanford last
September, tonight's lecturer held
j the post of curator of an exhibit of
| German paintings which toured the
| United States after the war. The
paintings belonged to collections in
Berlin museums.
"The pictures had been stored dur
| ing the war for protection in salt
mines in Thuringia," Dr. Birkmcyer
I reported. "Afterwards they were

taken into custody by the Amcri
cans."
Two hundred of these paintings ac- '

companied Dr. Birkmeyer over the
United States from April. IH4.S, to
March, 1049. His greatest worry was
to plan in advance for changes in cli
mate. "The pictures react to heal and
humidity and these problems had to
be pre-arranged."
A fellowship from the University
of Chicago later provided for a con
tinuation of his research in art his
tory and art theory. At this time he
also investigated the question of "art
sociology," the role of art in society.
Italian Renaissance art, especial
ly Raphael, i.s Dr. Birkmeyer's spe
cial field of interest. Tonight he will
show slides of 15th century paintings
and some Medieval works. His talk
will deal with bow Raphael tried to
bridge the spiritual dualism between
religion and secularism in his classi
cal works.
Before be began his education in
earnest, he took the preliminary
steps toward a career in engineering,
and soon discovered that he was far
more interested in "humanistic"
studies.
Dr Birkmeyer says he has been
happy ever sincc.
