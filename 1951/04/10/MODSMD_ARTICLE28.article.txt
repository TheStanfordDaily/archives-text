# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
I recently read some essays on microscopic animal
life by the late, beloved Robert Bench ley; and it's my
contention that if Mr. Benchley had ever been 011 the
Stanford Campus he might have written the following
Bull Session:
I am employed by the University as the airwick ad-

justei' in the biology and anatomy
laboratories. Which makes me
very jopular.
I used to lead a humdrum exist
ence, however, until one day I was
inspecting a deficient uirwick bot
tle with a magnifying glass. It was
then that I first saw Charley—a
microscopic animal swimming
coyly over the gentle waves of
uirwick fluid. Apparently, Char
ley didn't want to be half-safe.
J immediately fell in love with

Charley, for he had an engaging way of wrinkling up
his tentacles, which immediately put me at ease.
There 'could be no doubt that this was love at first
sight;.
I picked up my new friend with a pair of tweezers,
whix'h I later found out isn't supposed to be an easy
task. The particular species of which Charley is a
member usually cling together—to produce a coral
bead or to make a fourth for bridge. Or possibly just
for the >ake of goud fellowship. Evidently Charley
and I fiit'it oft' right from the start, for he left his
chums and eagerly climbed upon the tweezers.
I took Charley into the biology office, where several
professors were standing around, pulling black and
white beans out of paper bags.
"Look what I found," I announced.
Charley was placed under a magnifying glass as
all (he professors viewed him carefully. "Well, bless
my chlorophyll," cried one of the profs, "this is a
rare frobiscus. This must be the one that signed out
for the 1:110 late leave last week and never returned."
A 15,-minute demonstration followed, as the profes
sors jumped up and down and clapped their append
ages.^

It was then that I had to explain that Charley and I
were not at all unfriendly, or to put it more succinctly,
that we had fallen in love. I asked that Charley could
be mine, to have and to hold, from this day forward,
and the head of the department, dabbing a sea urchin
to his eye, consented.
In the months that followed, Charley and 1 were
gloriously happy, until one day I noticed that Charley
refused to accept the dab of Encina pimiento that I
offered him for dinner. Understanding why anyone
would refuse Encina pimiento, I gave him a speck of
luscious peanut butter, but he refused that, too. I put
Charley under the magnifying glass, and I noticed that
his body was racking with convulsive sobs.
In an attempt to shake Charley out of his sadness,
I took , him to Encina to watch the waterbags fall,
something which never failed to send him into excited
spasms of giggling. It wouldn't work. I took him to an
Excom meeting, and I let him read a Donald E. Close
lettei to the editor, but even these wouldn't shake
him from his moroseness.
It was then that I found out from a biology instruc
tor that a frobiscus could be either a boy or a girl, a
Charley or a Charlene, depending upon its mood and
how politics were going at the moment. On gray
day* when everything was going wrong, it could cast
itself loose and become a neuter. A frobiscus could
also be the object of its own passion. In short, Char
ley (or Charlene) was utterly, hopelessly, and head
over-heels in love with itself, without even knowing
it.
To get Charley back on his feet again, I took him on
an extended tour of the campus. I showed him the
gorgeous view from Hoover Tower. I took him to Lake
Lagunita to gaze into the azure depths, as blue as
Jack Benny's eyes. And from there to the cactus gar
den, but alas the romantic atmosphere added fuel to
the fire, and Charley gave up the ghost without ever
having declared his love for himself.
I returned to my job adjusting airwick bottles, not
just a little moved by what I had witnessed in nature's
realm of passion.
