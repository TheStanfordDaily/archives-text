TOKYO —United Nations forces
drove today to within one mile of
the huge Hwachon reservoir dam
where the Chinese Communists
opened floodgates yesterday in a
spectacular but futile effort to en

The gamble not only failed to stop
the Allied drive into North Korea
with a rushing torrent of water, but
Eighth Army officers said the Com
munists had lost perhaps for weeks
any chancc they might have had to
stasc a counter - offensive on the
central front.
