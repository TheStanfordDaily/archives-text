# Library Displays Cover Binding, Atomic Energy
## 
### 
Two diverse displays —one on bookbinding and the other on
atomic energy—are now being shown in the lobby of the Main
Library.
The display on bookbinding, a so-called "lost art," is sponsored
by the Farrar and Rinehart Bookbinding Contest.
Farrar & Rinehart are publishers of the Rivers of America Series,

28 books concerned with the princi
pal rivers of the U.S. To stimulate
publishers gave each of 28 binders,
public interest in bookbinding, the
most of them non-commercial, one of
the series of books to bind in suitable
fashion.
The results range from plain leath
er to elaborate bindings decorated
with fanciful designs impounded with
silver and gold leaf. Of particular in
terest to Californians are the volumes
on the Sacramento and Salinas Riv
ers.
The entries, for a limited time on
view in the glass cases of the delivery
court of the Main Library, will be
judged and a winner selected as soon
as their current tour of university
and public libraries throughout the
U.S. is complete. Joseph Belloli, Ref
erence and Humanities Librarian,
said they will not be displayed else
where in this area.
The second display, consisting of a
group of photographs entitled
''Atomie Energy," will remain in the
lobby of the Library until April 15.
The photography is the work of Life
magazine's veteran science photogra
pher, Fritz Goro. It was prepared in
consultation with the United States
Atomic Energy Commission.
