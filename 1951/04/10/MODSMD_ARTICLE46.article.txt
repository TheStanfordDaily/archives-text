## Punts and Pitches 
### 
Missed Out in Ouest for Glory
We missed Halley's comet (which comes around every century or so) but
we almost saw the Seals win their first ball game (which also comes every
century or so).
As it turned out, the O'Douls won their (irst last Sunday after hav
ing uii-nice tilings happen to them in the first 13 bouts; but we went up
to see them Friday night, when they still had a spotless record of un
success. It was a brisk, cold evening, and there was a gathering of 82
sympathizers to watch the goings-on (75 vendors. President Paul Pagan
and bis wife, and five seagulls).
The San Franciscans took the field first, and ran out just like human
beings. Seattle was retired without a run, and then the Seals came to bat.
When the dust had cleared and eyes had been put back in their sockets,
live runs had wandered across the plate, and three home runs had cleared
the fences. Hey! A big six and a locomotive. These weren't the Seals that
had dropped 10 straight. Here was real, stark, athletic prowess.
But, alas, rigor mortis began to set in, and at the end of the ninth, the
count was knotted at 6-all. Inning after inning passed by, with nothing hap
pening, and as tempus went on fugiting we remembered that our date had a
1:30 sign-out. The race was on—between the Seals and the 1:30 sign-out!
Finally, the sign-out won, and we gave up the ghost at the end of the 16th
inning, leaving the Seals to give up the yhost one inning later.
It's too bad the Seals had to win Sunday. They only needed five more
consecutive misfortunes to break the old record of 17. As Will Connolly
pointed out, (hey could have entered the Hall of Fame through the back
door. Sneaking through the servants' entrance, so to speak.
Now they're just an also-ran. Plenty of teams lose 10 or 13 games in a
low, but their records of unproductiveness are lost in the shuffle. As long
as a team loses 13, it might as well go five more and make a name for itself.
Now, the Seals have an ugly .071 percentage. As Connolly also pointed out,
.000 is easier on the eyes. Also easier to remember. Point oh-seven-one
isn't conducive to good vision. Its harsh angles make it offensive.
Pele (iole, the Absent-Minded Professor
Pete Cole, one of the nation's outstanding long-distance swimmers,
played straightinan on the swim team's recent jaunt to the NC2A finals
in Austin, Texas, and generally provided more side-splitting guffaws
than a barrel-full of Hob Hopes.
One day, Pete decided to visit Coach Tom Haynie, who was shelved with
tonsil trouble in the hospital. He hopped into a borrowed Chevy of '39 vin
tage with three Southern Cal swimmers and drove out to the hospital. The
Trojan mermen thought they'd play a trick, so while Cole was in the hospital,
lliey hopped in a nearby parked Cadillac.
When Cole returned, he looked for his three friends, and seeing them in
the Cad, he jumped in and tried to fit his Chevy key into the Cad keyhole,
not realizing that it was a different car. Attempt after attempt failed, so Cole
i an back to Haynie's hospital room, and with knitted brow, asked Haynie if
he had spied a lost key.
In the meantime, the playful Trojans switched back to the Chevy, and
when Cole returned from his futile search, he jumped into the Chevy and
found that the key worked. All the way back he was cussing himself out
for not making the key work in the first place.
* « #
Another time. Cole and several Stanford swimmers were invited to a meal
in a fraternity house at the University of Texas (where the meet was held).
The dishes were all turned upside down with the napkins under them. When
it came Cole's time to help himself to some beef stew, he neglected to turn
the plate right-side-up, and the uncontained eatments splattered all over
places that would embarrass Emily Post.
Another instance lound Cole talking with Michigan State Coach McCaf
frey. Afte McCaffrey had left. Cole put to Haynie (who was now out of the
hospital) this question: "Who does he swim for?"

ing uii-nice tilings happen to them in the first 13 bouts; but we went up
to see them Friday night, when they still had a spotless record of un
success. It was a brisk, cold evening, and there was a gathering of 82
sympathizers to watch the goings-on (75 vendors. President Paul Pagan
and bis wife, and five seagulls).
The San Franciscans took the field first, and ran out just like human
beings. Seattle was retired without a run, and then the Seals came to bat.
When the dust had cleared and eyes had been put back in their sockets,
live runs had wandered across the plate, and three home runs had cleared
the fences. Hey! A big six and a locomotive. These weren't the Seals that
had dropped 10 straight. Here was real, stark, athletic prowess.
But, alas, rigor mortis began to set in, and at the end of the ninth, the
count was knotted at 6-all. Inning after inning passed by, with nothing hap
pening, and as tempus went on fugiting we remembered that our date had a
1:30 sign-out. The race was on—between the Seals and the 1:30 sign-out!
Finally, the sign-out won, and we gave up the ghost at the end of the 16th
inning, leaving the Seals to give up the yhost one inning later.
It's too bad the Seals had to win Sunday. They only needed five more
consecutive misfortunes to break the old record of 17. As Will Connolly
pointed out, (hey could have entered the Hall of Fame through the back
door. Sneaking through the servants' entrance, so to speak.
Now they're just an also-ran. Plenty of teams lose 10 or 13 games in a
low, but their records of unproductiveness are lost in the shuffle. As long
as a team loses 13, it might as well go five more and make a name for itself.
Now, the Seals have an ugly .071 percentage. As Connolly also pointed out,
.000 is easier on the eyes. Also easier to remember. Point oh-seven-one
isn't conducive to good vision. Its harsh angles make it offensive.

Pete Cole, one of the nation's outstanding long-distance swimmers,
played straightinan on the swim team's recent jaunt to the NC2A finals
in Austin, Texas, and generally provided more side-splitting guffaws
than a barrel-full of Hob Hopes.
One day, Pete decided to visit Coach Tom Haynie, who was shelved with
tonsil trouble in the hospital. He hopped into a borrowed Chevy of '39 vin
tage with three Southern Cal swimmers and drove out to the hospital. The
Trojan mermen thought they'd play a trick, so while Cole was in the hospital,
lliey hopped in a nearby parked Cadillac.
When Cole returned, he looked for his three friends, and seeing them in
the Cad, he jumped in and tried to fit his Chevy key into the Cad keyhole,
not realizing that it was a different car. Attempt after attempt failed, so Cole
i an back to Haynie's hospital room, and with knitted brow, asked Haynie if
he had spied a lost key.
In the meantime, the playful Trojans switched back to the Chevy, and
when Cole returned from his futile search, he jumped into the Chevy and
found that the key worked. All the way back he was cussing himself out
for not making the key work in the first place.

Another time. Cole and several Stanford swimmers were invited to a meal
in a fraternity house at the University of Texas (where the meet was held).
The dishes were all turned upside down with the napkins under them. When
it came Cole's time to help himself to some beef stew, he neglected to turn
the plate right-side-up, and the uncontained eatments splattered all over
places that would embarrass Emily Post.
Another instance lound Cole talking with Michigan State Coach McCaf
frey. Afte McCaffrey had left. Cole put to Haynie (who was now out of the
hospital) this question: "Who does he swim for?"

sympathizers to watch the goings-on (75 vendors. President Paul Pagan
and bis wife, and five seagulls).
The San Franciscans took the field first, and ran out just like human
beings. Seattle was retired without a run, and then the Seals came to bat.
When the dust had cleared and eyes had been put back in their sockets,
live runs had wandered across the plate, and three home runs had cleared
the fences. Hey! A big six and a locomotive. These weren't the Seals that
had dropped 10 straight. Here was real, stark, athletic prowess.
But, alas, rigor mortis began to set in, and at the end of the ninth, the
count was knotted at 6-all. Inning after inning passed by, with nothing hap
pening, and as tempus went on fugiting we remembered that our date had a
1:30 sign-out. The race was on—between the Seals and the 1:30 sign-out!
Finally, the sign-out won, and we gave up the ghost at the end of the 16th
inning, leaving the Seals to give up the yhost one inning later.
It's too bad the Seals had to win Sunday. They only needed five more
consecutive misfortunes to break the old record of 17. As Will Connolly
pointed out, (hey could have entered the Hall of Fame through the back
door. Sneaking through the servants' entrance, so to speak.
Now they're just an also-ran. Plenty of teams lose 10 or 13 games in a
low, but their records of unproductiveness are lost in the shuffle. As long
as a team loses 13, it might as well go five more and make a name for itself.
Now, the Seals have an ugly .071 percentage. As Connolly also pointed out,
.000 is easier on the eyes. Also easier to remember. Point oh-seven-one
isn't conducive to good vision. Its harsh angles make it offensive.

Pete Cole, one of the nation's outstanding long-distance swimmers,
played straightinan on the swim team's recent jaunt to the NC2A finals
in Austin, Texas, and generally provided more side-splitting guffaws
than a barrel-full of Hob Hopes.
One day, Pete decided to visit Coach Tom Haynie, who was shelved with
tonsil trouble in the hospital. He hopped into a borrowed Chevy of '39 vin
tage with three Southern Cal swimmers and drove out to the hospital. The
Trojan mermen thought they'd play a trick, so while Cole was in the hospital,
lliey hopped in a nearby parked Cadillac.
When Cole returned, he looked for his three friends, and seeing them in
the Cad, he jumped in and tried to fit his Chevy key into the Cad keyhole,
not realizing that it was a different car. Attempt after attempt failed, so Cole
i an back to Haynie's hospital room, and with knitted brow, asked Haynie if
he had spied a lost key.
In the meantime, the playful Trojans switched back to the Chevy, and
when Cole returned from his futile search, he jumped into the Chevy and
found that the key worked. All the way back he was cussing himself out
for not making the key work in the first place.

Another time. Cole and several Stanford swimmers were invited to a meal
in a fraternity house at the University of Texas (where the meet was held).
The dishes were all turned upside down with the napkins under them. When
it came Cole's time to help himself to some beef stew, he neglected to turn
the plate right-side-up, and the uncontained eatments splattered all over
places that would embarrass Emily Post.
Another instance lound Cole talking with Michigan State Coach McCaf
frey. Afte McCaffrey had left. Cole put to Haynie (who was now out of the
hospital) this question: "Who does he swim for?"

QUOTE OF THE WEEK. Umpire Kay Atkinson got off a goodie at last
Saturday's Santa Clara-Stanford baseball game, nl an effort to get a
stray dog off the field, he hung onto the mutt's collar and led him off,
seeing-eye dog-fashion. His remark? ' Now they know I'm blind!"
