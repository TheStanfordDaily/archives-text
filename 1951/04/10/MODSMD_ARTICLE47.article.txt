DALLAS, Tex., April 9 (UP) —
Manager Casey Stengel of the New
York Yankees was ejected in the
third inning of today's game with
the Boston Braves when he at
tempted to punch Umpire Augie
Donatelli of the National League.
Stengel — who had never before
been thrown out of a game while
manager of the Yankees — became
incensed when Donatelli ruled that
the Braves had completed an in
ning-ending double play before a
potential run had scored from third
base.
