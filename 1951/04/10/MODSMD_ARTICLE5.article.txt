# Cal Loyalty Oath

### 
SACRAMENTO â€” Regents of the
University of California were urged
today in a resolution introduced in
the Senate to appeal the recent ap
pellate court ruling that called the
university's loyalty oath unconsti
tutional.
"The effects of the ruling arc far
reaching and cast, grave doubt as to
the applicability of the state loy
alty oath to other persons employed
by the University of California,' the
resolution read.
