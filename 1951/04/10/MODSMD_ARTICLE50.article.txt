## Cards Slide Into Gators 
### 
Stanford's up-and-coming Indians
take a breather this afternoon when
they meet a visiting San Francisco
State nine at 3:15 on the Sunken
Diamond.
About all the Gators have been
able to do so far this year is to give
several teams, including California,
a scare. Stanford, on the other
hand, got off to a lethargic start at
USC but now appears to be fully
awake. Alter taking two games out
of three last weekend, the Cards ap
pear to be on their way, and the
heavy artillery should really open
up on what offerings the visiting
hurlers choose to toss up.
On the hill for Coach Dean's an
gered troops will be Bob Murphy,
who hopes to get back on the win
ning trail after some rough treat
ment from USC and Santa Barbara.
"Jack be nimble. Jack be quick"
Alexander and Tony Stellar, he of
the big curve ball, will also be on
hand for hill duty.
j Dick Cole, the hustling long-ball
hitter, will take charge of third, Hal
Hennacy or Jim Walsh will open at
first, and the double - play kings,
Bruce Cameron and Art Abraham -
son. will again be at short and sec
j ond.
Lefty Jim Agar, who hit the long
i triple against Santa Clara, gets the
I right-field nod, the veteran Dick
Clegg will handle center, and
"Cracker Jack" Shepanl will round
out the fence-busting outfield crew.
Billy Herron will be on the re
ceiving end of Murphy's tosses.
