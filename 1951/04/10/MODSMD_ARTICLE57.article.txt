The YWCA needs students to cn-

The sophomore "Y" wants Stan
! ford students to read to the chilâ€”
j drcn, play with them in their hack
| yard, and take them to the park.
Interested students may sign up in
| .the "Y" office upstairs in the Worn-
I en's Clubhouse.
The school is located about a mile
I down El Camino, within walking or
bicycling distance.
Hours arc 10 to 12 in the morn
ings and any time from 2 to 5 in
the afternoons.
The "Y" would like to have two

substitutes.
The kindergarten, for children
