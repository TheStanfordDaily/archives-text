The State Senate look steps today
to set up it* own "Little Kcfauver"
Crime Committee.

crime - study commission proposed
by Gov. Earl Warren.
The Senators backing the propo
sal to organize their own crime
study said they could see no reason
why there shouldn't be two com
missions to study organized crime.
Warren already has served no
tice he intends to set up a new
crime commission similar to the one
that made headlines in 1049-50. He
has asked the Legislature for $100.-
000 for its work and to give it the
