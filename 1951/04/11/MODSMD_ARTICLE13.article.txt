# Raphael's Art Called Unique
## 
### 
The works of Raphael, according
to Dr. Karl Birkmeyer of the Stan
ford Art Department, mark "the
unique point in the history of West
ern culture where supernatural re
igious thoughts are adequately rep
resented in natural forms."
Dr. Birkmeyer, addressing a
Tuesday Evening Series audience
in Memorial Hall last night, traced
the development and final recon
ciliation in Renaissance art of the
demands of the church and the de
mands of ordinary existence.
Slides of works by Uccello, del
Castagno, and Pollaiuolo showed
the Renaissance aim "toward the
mastering of physical reality." A
Madonna by Margaritonc illustrated
the stylized, other-worldly Medie
val approach.
Dr. Birkmeyer analyzed several
Raphael Madonnas (including the
Si.st.inc, Ihe Madonna Alba, the Ma
donna of Ihe Meadow, and the Ma
donna of the Goldfinch), a series of
paintings of St. George killing the
dragon, and the Transfiguration of
Christ.
"If we relate again Raphael's
paintings to the problems out of
which they emerged," Dr. Birk
meyer concluded, "they become
more than just pleasing and enjoy
able; they can carry a valuable
message also for the spiritual tur
moil of 20th-century mankind."
