# COMMISSION FOR STUDENT AID SELECTS RECIPIENTS OF FINANCIAL HELP
## Many Are Eligible for Grants-in-Aid 
### 
About 50 students reccivc
several thousand dollars in
grants-in-aid every quarter, de
pending upon how many appli
cations are received.
The Commission for Student Aid,
an ASSU committee, exists to see
that students deserving and requiring
financial aid arc able to complete
their education at Stanford.
Set tip by the Board of Trustees
in co-opcration with the ASSU. the
commission governs the distribution
of grants-in-aid. It is composed of
three student members, a representa
tive of the administration, and a
member of the faculty as permanent
chairman.
The student members usually
serve two quarters or longer. Their
terms arc planned to overlap in

order to promote continuity and sta
bility of policy.
Temporary Aid Only
Grants-in-aid are outright gifts,
not loans. They are intended to re
lieve temporary financial crises
rather than to ofTer continuous as
sistance.
The funds are reserved for needs
of the established members of the
Stanford community who entered
school expecting to pay their own
way.
If such students run into unex
pected financial difficulties, grants
, can be a temporary aid. They are
rarely awarded to students who have
; been at Stanford only a short time.
Grants are most often made for one
or two quarters, rarely for a period !
; of over three. Graduate students arc i
eligible, but undergraduates get
preference if funds are limited.

To obtain a gi ant a needy student
may apply to the commission. Each
applicant is interviewed at least once,
usually by a student member of the
commission. The commission meets
five or six times a quarter to discuss
the many applications and inter
views.
It then decides if the giant is lo he
given, its amount, and its duration.
After the need of the applicant has
been established, other factors are
taken into consideration when it is
necessary to narrow the field.
Factors Considered
These include the contribution and
value of the applicant to the Uni
versity community; seriousness of
purpose as indicated by efforts to
help himself; evidence of careful
thought in program arranging so that
need is temporary; and evidence of
emotional and intellectual capability

to carry through the planned aca
demic program.
Tlir* funds, allocated by the P>oard
of Trustees, tho ASSU, nnd private
individuals, arc at thr disposal of
needy Stanford students who qualify
in all hut academic record for recu
lar scholarships.
In njany cases, recipients <>112 Grants
almost at once raise their averages
after being relieved of financial
strain.
Sometimes they even qualify for
' scholarships after a quarter or two.
