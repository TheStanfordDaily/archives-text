# Honor Code of Behavior
## 
### 
Sunday's action by the Council for Student
Control in adjudging three students guilty of
Honor Code violations brings to mind a phase
of the time-honored code many Stanford stu
dents may tend to forget.
That phase concerns cheating on papers,
criticisms, and reviews of one type and another.
It concerns the failure to observe the code on
individual work done by the student on his own
time.
Because some of us may think only in terms
of examinations when we sign the Honor Code
pledge at the beginning of each quarter, today's
Daily includes on this page a story by staff
writer Walt Menninger covering the rules that
apply to violations of the less publicized—but
equally important—variety.
Unlike examination rules, which are pretty
much standardized throughout the University,
the rules about writing papers are set down by
each individual professor.
Sometimes professors prefer small groups of
students to collaborate on written work, simply
because of the large volume of material which
has to be covered and the short space of time
in which to cover it.
Other times, professors stipulate that there
shall be no collaboration of any sort.
Again, in many cases, professors encourage
students to read background material on plays,
reviewed or criticized for a grade.

In other instances, such formulas are strictly
prohibited.
But it is not our purpose to evaluate teacher
methods. The decision on how a student is to
go about writing a paper lies with the professor
himself, his only duty being to inform his stu
dents in no uncertain terms just what the rules
are, so that no misunderstandings may occur.
Even after the rules about papers are laid
down for all to see, however, it is obvious
that the temptation to "job" a report or copy
parts of a paper from unauthorized sources be
comes very real to some students. On the other
hand, when a student is in a classroom taking a
final with 50 classmates, such a temptation is
only admitted at the risk of being seen by
others.
Cheating in either case, however, is unfair
both to those who competed fairly and to the
Honor Code system as a whole. Professors,
their readers, or students in the classroom who
fail to try and prevent such violations—either
by reporting them or better yet by sitting down
tor a talk with the student concerned—are just
as unmindful of their obligation to the code as
are those who violate it.
"Eternal vigilance," if we may be so trite,
is one of the very foundations upon which our
Honor Code rests. If all of us can couple watch
fulness with a desire to prevent future viola
tions, we are sure the code will remain as
strpng as it has always been, if not stronger.

Other times, professors stipulate that there
shall be no collaboration of any sort.
Again, in many cases, professors encourage
students to read background material on plays,
reviewed or criticized for a grade.

In other instances, such formulas are strictly
prohibited.
But it is not our purpose to evaluate teacher
methods. The decision on how a student is to
go about writing a paper lies with the professor
himself, his only duty being to inform his stu
dents in no uncertain terms just what the rules
are, so that no misunderstandings may occur.
Even after the rules about papers are laid
down for all to see, however, it is obvious
that the temptation to "job" a report or copy
parts of a paper from unauthorized sources be
comes very real to some students. On the other
hand, when a student is in a classroom taking a
final with 50 classmates, such a temptation is
only admitted at the risk of being seen by
others.
Cheating in either case, however, is unfair
both to those who competed fairly and to the
Honor Code system as a whole. Professors,
their readers, or students in the classroom who
fail to try and prevent such violations—either
by reporting them or better yet by sitting down
tor a talk with the student concerned—are just
as unmindful of their obligation to the code as
are those who violate it.
"Eternal vigilance," if we may be so trite,
is one of the very foundations upon which our
Honor Code rests. If all of us can couple watch
fulness with a desire to prevent future viola
tions, we are sure the code will remain as
strpng as it has always been, if not stronger.
Sunday's action by the Council for Student
Control in adjudging three students guilty of
Honor Code violations brings to mind a phase
of the time-honored code many Stanford stu
dents may tend to forget.
That phase concerns cheating on papers,
criticisms, and reviews of one type and another.
It concerns the failure to observe the code on
individual work done by the student on his own
time.
Because some of us may think only in terms
of examinations when we sign the Honor Code
pledge at the beginning of each quarter, today's
Daily includes on this page a story by staff
writer Walt Menninger covering the rules that
apply to violations of the less publicized—but
equally important—variety.
Unlike examination rules, which are pretty
much standardized throughout the University,
the rules about writing papers are set down by
each individual professor.
Sometimes professors prefer small groups of
students to collaborate on written work, simply
because of the large volume of material which
has to be covered and the short space of time
in which to cover it.
Other times, professors stipulate that there
shall be no collaboration of any sort.
