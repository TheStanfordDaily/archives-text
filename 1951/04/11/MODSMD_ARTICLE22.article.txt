# New Life for Reg Dances
## 
### 
Several constructive suggestions have re
sulted from the discussion, by Excom and in
The Daily, of the financial failure of the last
Reg Dance.
It has been generally agreed that Excom
should select the sponsoring organization for
the dances well before the end of the preceding
quarter. Enough publicity should precede this
selection to insure that all interested groups
have time to apply.
Furthermore, each organization that does ap
ply to sponsor the Reg Dance should be re
quired to present to Excom an outline of its
plans for the dance. The final selection should
be based on the quality of these plans as well
as on financial need.
It has also been suggested that the winter
and spring Reg Dances be held on the first
weekend of school, rather than on Reg Day
itself. Since many students arrive to register
at the last possible hour, they are often too tired
for partying. And the boys complain that they
have no time to get dates for that night.
The fall quarter Reg Dance, which is usually
a great financial success, should continue to be
held on the second day of registration. It
draws its largest support from the freshmen,
who have been on campus for four or five days
and are looking for social activity.
Admitting the value of these suggestions for
physical changes in Reg Dance procedure, we
still must consider one more point. It concerns
the intangible factor of attitude.
Fall quarter, as we mentioned, the freshmen

eagerly support the Reg Dance. Winter quarter
very few of them attend. As a matter of fact,
many present upperclassmen admit that they
haven't been to a Reg Dance since they were
first-quarter freshmen.
Why should there be this tremendous falling
off of interest?
It may be because that first dance was not
a good one. Perhaps the sponsoring group
coasted on the knowledge that fall Reg Dances
always get good crowds and put little effort into
its planning.
But more likely the freshmen became aware
of the general attitude on campus toward Reg
Dances. They learned that there is more pres
tige in being seen at small living-group parties
or at favorite spots along the highway than at
the dance. They noticed that the campus lead
ers were seldom seen at Reg Dances.
If the Reg Dances are ever again to be suc
cessful social functions, that attitude must
change. The student body leaders and the
"campus prominents" must support them with
their presence, as well as with their words.
All-campus dances can be an important uni
fying activity at Stanford. They can help re
tain some of the small-school feeling so easily
lost in present expansion.
But they can only do this if everyone—upper
classmen included—is convinced that they're
the place to go, and has learned that it can be
fun to get out and see old friends or make new
ones outside the usual small circle.- C. H.

of the general attitude on campus toward Reg
Dances. They learned that there is more pres
tige in being seen at small living-group parties
or at favorite spots along the highway than at
the dance. They noticed that the campus lead
ers were seldom seen at Reg Dances.
If the Reg Dances are ever again to be suc
cessful social functions, that attitude must
change. The student body leaders and the
"campus prominents" must support them with
their presence, as well as with their words.
All-campus dances can be an important uni
fying activity at Stanford. They can help re
tain some of the small-school feeling so easily
lost in present expansion.
But they can only do this if everyone—upper
classmen included—is convinced that they're
the place to go, and has learned that it can be
fun to get out and see old friends or make new
ones outside the usual small circle.- C. H.
Several constructive suggestions have re
sulted from the discussion, by Excom and in
The Daily, of the financial failure of the last
Reg Dance.
It has been generally agreed that Excom
should select the sponsoring organization for
the dances well before the end of the preceding
quarter. Enough publicity should precede this
selection to insure that all interested groups
have time to apply.
Furthermore, each organization that does ap
ply to sponsor the Reg Dance should be re
quired to present to Excom an outline of its
plans for the dance. The final selection should
be based on the quality of these plans as well
as on financial need.
It has also been suggested that the winter
and spring Reg Dances be held on the first
weekend of school, rather than on Reg Day
itself. Since many students arrive to register
at the last possible hour, they are often too tired
for partying. And the boys complain that they
have no time to get dates for that night.
The fall quarter Reg Dance, which is usually
a great financial success, should continue to be
held on the second day of registration. It
draws its largest support from the freshmen,
who have been on campus for four or five days
and are looking for social activity.
Admitting the value of these suggestions for
physical changes in Reg Dance procedure, we
still must consider one more point. It concerns
the intangible factor of attitude.
Fall quarter, as we mentioned, the freshmen

eagerly support the Reg Dance. Winter quarter
very few of them attend. As a matter of fact,
many present upperclassmen admit that they
haven't been to a Reg Dance since they were
first-quarter freshmen.
Why should there be this tremendous falling
off of interest?
It may be because that first dance was not
a good one. Perhaps the sponsoring group
coasted on the knowledge that fall Reg Dances
always get good crowds and put little effort into
its planning.
But more likely the freshmen became aware
of the general attitude on campus toward Reg
Dances. They learned that there is more pres
tige in being seen at small living-group parties
or at favorite spots along the highway than at
the dance. They noticed that the campus lead
ers were seldom seen at Reg Dances.
