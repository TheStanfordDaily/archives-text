# LITTLE KNOWN, BUT WORTH SOME THOUGHT
## Code Covers Papers, Too! 
### WALT WENNINGER 
With the conviction of three Honor Code violators
this week, the question has again arisen as to just
what Ls the extent of the Honor Code. Everybody
knows that obvious cheating on tests and papers is
against the Code, but where is the line drawn between
legal and illegal procedure?
As explained by the ASSU Constitution, "the Honor
Code is an undertaking of the students, individually
and collectively, pledging:
"Thai they will not give nor receive aid in exami
nations; that they will not give nor receive unper
mitted aid in class work, in the preparation of re
ports, or in any other work that is to he used by the
instructor as the hasis of grading."
In other words, the Honor Code covers anything
and everything that the instructor intends to count
toward the final grade in the course. This fact is com
paratively well known. Hie little regarded conse
quence of it is that, as Honor Code Chairman Wayne
Alley put it, "jobbing papers and (-heating on exams
are equally serious violations. The seriousness of any
violation consists not in the violation itself, but in the
fact that it is a defection of personal honor."
Thus, a little quiz, a final examination, a lab report,
a short theme, and a 100-page paper are all of equal
importance as a violation of the Honor Code. In fact,
upon closer examination, unpermitted plagiarism on a
paper or report appears to be perhaps a more serious
(jffenfce because of the premeditation involved.
Premeditation has been defined as the calculation
of doing aii act before the actual performance of the

act; and in the context of the Honor Code at Stanford,
the making of the decision to cheat before so doing
may be considered premeditation. In this sense, neces
sarily there is more premeditation involved in the
"jobbing" of a paper or laboratory report than in the
cheating on an exam.
Therefore, the Council of Student Control, the
punitive agency for the Honor Code, considers pla
giarism in a paper equally serious to cheating in an
examination.
However, the question of how to draw the line con
cerning the Honor Code remains as an important ques
tion to be answered. Perhaps the best solution to the
problem is offered by Alley. In his words, "The intel
ligence of the Stanford student is high enough that
he himself, with a little reflection, can make the cor
rect decision."
Alley sets forth, as a formula for avoiding Honor
Code difficulties, the following suggestions. "Let rea
son be your guide. Consider the consequences of what
you do. Think it over."
In most courses, the instructors designate just what
is to be the subject of the grading for the course. In
this case, there should be no doubt as to what is and
what is not covered by the Honor Code. In the other
courses where an absolute line cannot be drawn for
the benefit of the student, a little reflection should
provide the answer.
In case of doubt, the student can always avoid
trouble by consulting the instructor.

cheating on an exam.
Therefore, the Council of Student Control, the
punitive agency for the Honor Code, considers pla
giarism in a paper equally serious to cheating in an
examination.
However, the question of how to draw the line con
cerning the Honor Code remains as an important ques
tion to be answered. Perhaps the best solution to the
problem is offered by Alley. In his words, "The intel

he himself, with a little reflection, can make the cor
rect decision."
Alley sets forth, as a formula for avoiding Honor
Code difficulties, the following suggestions. "Let rea
son be your guide. Consider the consequences of what
you do. Think it over."
In most courses, the instructors designate just what
is to be the subject of the grading for the course. In
this case, there should be no doubt as to what is and
what is not covered by the Honor Code. In the other
courses where an absolute line cannot be drawn for
the benefit of the student, a little reflection should
provide the answer.
In case of doubt, the student can always avoid
trouble by consulting the instructor.

With the conviction of three Honor Code violators
this week, the question has again arisen as to just
what Ls the extent of the Honor Code. Everybody
knows that obvious cheating on tests and papers is
against the Code, but where is the line drawn between
legal and illegal procedure?
As explained by the ASSU Constitution, "the Honor
Code is an undertaking of the students, individually
and collectively, pledging:
"Thai they will not give nor receive aid in exami
nations; that they will not give nor receive unper
mitted aid in class work, in the preparation of re
ports, or in any other work that is to he used by the
instructor as the hasis of grading."
In other words, the Honor Code covers anything
and everything that the instructor intends to count
toward the final grade in the course. This fact is com
paratively well known. Hie little regarded conse
quence of it is that, as Honor Code Chairman Wayne
Alley put it, "jobbing papers and (-heating on exams
are equally serious violations. The seriousness of any
violation consists not in the violation itself, but in the
fact that it is a defection of personal honor."
Thus, a little quiz, a final examination, a lab report,
a short theme, and a 100-page paper are all of equal
importance as a violation of the Honor Code. In fact,
upon closer examination, unpermitted plagiarism on a
paper or report appears to be perhaps a more serious
(jffenfce because of the premeditation involved.
Premeditation has been defined as the calculation
of doing aii act before the actual performance of the

act; and in the context of the Honor Code at Stanford,
the making of the decision to cheat before so doing
may be considered premeditation. In this sense, neces
sarily there is more premeditation involved in the
