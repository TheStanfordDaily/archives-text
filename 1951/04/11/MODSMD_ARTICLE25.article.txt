# Four Alpiners Ski, Hike Ninety Miles in Nine Days
## 
### PAULINE KUNZ 
Unlike those Stanfordites who
spent spring vacation at the
beach, four members of the Al
pine Club took to the mountains
â€”skiing and hiking across Se
quoia National Park, a distance
of 90 miles.
The group used Whitney Portal,
12 miles east of Ml. Whitney, as
their "jumping-off place." They
skied past Mt. Whitney, ascending
from 8,000 to 13,500 feet, to Whit
ney Pass, which is only a mile from
the top of the mountain itself. The
ever-present danger of avalanches
made the crossing rather precarious.
In addition, the snow was deep in
the pass and the men were forced to
use a rope to get over.
Snow and Swimming
After pitching camp on the other
side of the pass, the Alpiners de
scended the next day to Kern River
Canyon, which is at an elevation of
0,700 feet. They followed the can
yon for eight miles to Kern Hot
Springs, where they spent the rest
of the day swimming. The next day,
after climbing out of the canyon
and crossing u plateau, they dropped
down into the Big Arroyo Canyon.
The alternating snow and clouds
forced the men to spend two nights
and a day in the canyon.
When the weather cleared up, the
group began the climb to Nine
Lakes Pass, which proved to be the
most beautiful part of the trip. On
the other side of the pass, they
started to follow a canyon along a
creek, but the dense fog compelled
them to pitch camp for the night.
Tamarack Luke
The next morning they reached
Tamarack Lake. They were able to
ski a few miles farther but had to
hike when the snow ran out. They
followed the High Sierra trail for 17
miles until they arrived at the Giant
Forest Ranger Station. Here they
were given a ride to Ash Mountain,
where they had left their car.
Of the 90 miles which they had
covered during the nine days of the
trip, the Alpiners hiked well over 50
miles. Although they carried some
of their food, in addition to sleep
ing bags, tents, and skis, they used
two caches of food which had been
set up by two other Stanford hikers
the summer before. The four Al
piners who took part in the trip
were Rowland Tabor, Malcolm
Clark, Jack Weicker, and Jack
Maling.
