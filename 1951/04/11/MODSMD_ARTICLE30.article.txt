# Crew Readies for South
## Beggs to Set First Boating 
### 
With only one more home
workout left, Coach Jim Beggs
sent his three varsity shells
through heavy training this
morning and yesterday. To
morrow the varsity and jayvees
head south for the Newport Re
gatta which is scheduled for
Saturday.
The workouts have been averaging
about two hours and consist of at
least 12 miles of rowing. By keeping
pace with the earlier rising sun, the
varsity has been able to get in the
longer sessions which now start at 5
a.m. Emphasis has been on building
up a higher stroke, gaining polish on
the starts, and finishing up each
morning with a mile race.

So far, the first shell has been ham
pered by considerable sick-bay trou
ble. Latest blow has been the absence
of big Don Craven, who is still re
covering from pneumonia and will
not make the trip south.
Craven's experience gained in last
year's Nationals will be sorely missed
in the middle of the first shell. Bill
Meyer is still on the mend after being
out for a week with the flu. And
Captain Jim Fifer has not fully re
covered from a bad back.
While Beggs has not made any final
decisions on the first boat, and won't
until later today, competition has
narrowed down to 11 oarsmen. Little
120-lb. Dave Herdeman will handle
the coxswain chores for the varsity.
The peppery junior piloted Stanford

to a disputed third at Marietta last
year.
Four Veteran Oarsmen
Other veterans from last year's Na
tionals are Arend Horstmeyer, Bill
Meyer, Jim Fifer, and Dick Porter.
Horstmeyer is the only man who
came to Stanford with any past expe
rience.
Meyer, a solidly-built guy tabbed
"Moose," transferred to the Farm
from lowa State. Porter rowed bow
last year, and holds the same spot.
Fifer, who was stroke in last season's
campaign, bothered by the ailing
back, is now rowing at No, 2.

junior, Dewey Hecht. Hecht trans
ferred from Menlo last year, and
gained his only experience on the
Jayvees. Bob Farnsworth, up from
the jayvee rows No. 4.

ON THE WATER AT 5 A.M.—Coxswain Dave Herdeman pre
pares to send varsity crewmen (bottom to top) Dewey Hecht,
Bill Meyers, Arend Horstmeyer, Don Craven, Bob Farnsworth,
Bill McCarthy, Captain Jim Fifer, and Dick Porter off on a trial
run.
With only one more home
workout left, Coach Jim Beggs
sent his three varsity shells
through heavy training this
morning and yesterday. To
morrow the varsity and jayvees
head south for the Newport Re
gatta which is scheduled for
Saturday.
The workouts have been averaging
about two hours and consist of at
least 12 miles of rowing. By keeping
pace with the earlier rising sun, the
varsity has been able to get in the
longer sessions which now start at 5
a.m. Emphasis has been on building
up a higher stroke, gaining polish on
the starts, and finishing up each
morning with a mile race.
Illness Cripples Team
So far, the first shell has been ham
pered by considerable sick-bay trou
ble. Latest blow has been the absence
of big Don Craven, who is still re
covering from pneumonia and will
not make the trip south.
Craven's experience gained in last
year's Nationals will be sorely missed
in the middle of the first shell. Bill
Meyer is still on the mend after being
out for a week with the flu. And
Captain Jim Fifer has not fully re
covered from a bad back.
While Beggs has not made any final
decisions on the first boat, and won't
until later today, competition has
narrowed down to 11 oarsmen. Little
120-lb. Dave Herdeman will handle
the coxswain chores for the varsity.
The peppery junior piloted Stanford

to a disputed third at Marietta last
year.
Four Veteran Oarsmen
Other veterans from last year's Na
tionals are Arend Horstmeyer, Bill
Meyer, Jim Fifer, and Dick Porter.
Horstmeyer is the only man who
came to Stanford with any past expe
rience.
Meyer, a solidly-built guy tabbed
"Moose," transferred to the Farm
from lowa State. Porter rowed bow
last year, and holds the same spot.
Fifer, who was stroke in last season's
campaign, bothered by the ailing
back, is now rowing at No, 2.
Holding down stroke it; another
junior, Dewey Hecht. Hecht trans
ferred from Menlo last year, and
gained his only experience on the
Jayvees. Bob Farnsworth, up from
the jayvee rows No. 4.
