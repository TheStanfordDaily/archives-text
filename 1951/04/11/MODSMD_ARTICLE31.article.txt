### DIGGER ODELL 
So many gridders showed up for
the first session of spring practice
Monday that it looked like they had
to dig up the equipment room for
some of the uniforms that appeared.
One helmet that looked like a 1930
vintage was seen in the multitude
of white pants and sweatshirts
trimmed in red, green, blue, and
yellow jerseys. Very scenic.
It was so crowded on the practice
field that we had trouble locating
any of the coaches, especially Chuck
Taylor, who isn't exactly the biggest
guy in the world. Luckily, the
coaches were all wearing red caps,
and every once in a while you'd see
one of them bobbing up and down
in the mass of beef that covered the
gridiron.
As he promised, Chuck had his
charges perspiring within 10 min
utes of their appearance on the field.
One erstwhile gridder later reported
that he lost 16 pounds during the
afternoon. If Taylor doesn't want a
team of midgets, he'd better be
careful.
The first hour of practice was
spent in putting (he gridders
through strenuous, pound - rolling
calisthenics; Chuck and his stair had
them doing everything from the old
push-ups and sit-ups to belly-roll
ing and head-rolling. We hate to
say it, but if it's contortionists Tay
lor is looking for, he's going to be
awfully disappointed.

Joe Chez, Indian star pitcher, lost
his first league game in two years
last Saturday against Santa Clara.
Joe, who just got out of bed from
an attack of pneumonia, pitched
flawless ball for the first five in
nings, allowing only one walk, while
giving up four scattered hits for one
run. After that, though, Chez be
gan to tire.
Earlier in the day, Joe had re
ported a kink in his back, but
thought he could work it out. He
also was under doctor's orders to
pitch only four innings unless he
felt O.K.
Chez, however, isn't the kind of
man who would toss in his glove
with the score all knotted up. Per
haps a more conservative coach
would have replaced him in the fifth
or sixth frame, but then Chez had
done fine so far and, knowing Joe,
he probably said he felt fine, wheth
er or not he actually did. At any
rate, Joe went the distance, and he
almost did it successfully. As it
was, it took the Broncos an extt-a
inning.
When Joe is fully recovered,
we're looking for him to bring the
Cards back to prosperity and happi
ness.
