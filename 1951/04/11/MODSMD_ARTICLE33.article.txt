# Golfers to Host Powerful Bruins
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated golf team j
will face their toughest opposition j
to date when UCLA's power-packed ;
Bruins invade the Farm this Friday. \
The Cards, who have downed |
Moffett Field, Santa Clara, Cal, and
Cal Poly in their first lour outings, j
will field almost the same lineup as I
last Saturday. The only exception
will be Roland Conklin, who was at
Pasatiempo last week playing Ken
Venturi in the finals of the North
ern California Intercollegiates.
For UCLA. Pay Steelsmith, one of
their big guns last year, will prob
ably be in the number one spot.
Close behind him are Dave Banks
and Ben Alyea from last year's
squad and Dave Stanley, a transfer
from Los Angeles City College.
