Civil defense cliirf Alf Brandin
appointed Dr. Donald (bay, profes
sor of anatomy, to issue information
to students and faculty as to what
to do in case of an alert.
Information is to cover especially
cases of students out of class or in j

bead, has already issued instruc
tions to student,s in campus living ;
units.
Miss Doyle ;tnd Dean of Students j
If. Donald Winbigler are to work
out plans for indoctrinating students j
in living groups.
First Aid Teaching
Brandin also announced a pro
gram of first aid instruction in co
operation with the Palo Alto Red
Cross. Police and fire wardens,
command center personnel, mid di
rectors of the bousing atid feeding
civil defense divisions will be re- i
quired to take the instructions.
Brandin said instruction will not
be required for POTC students
since they receive sinular instruc- j
tion in class, and because of the rap
id turnover in the reserve pro
grams.
Administration of the loyalty
oath, required of all civil defense
personnel, was postponed until a list

of subversive organizations prohib
ited by the oath is received from
Pal Brown, California State Attor
ney General.
Inadequate Fire Whistle
Brandin said two Firehou.se sirens
used for alerts in World War II will
be used for warning signals. He
called the inadequacy of the Fire

house* whistle one of the major flaws
In last quarter's alert.
Summing up last quarter's alerts,
Brandin named the warning signal,
confusion of ROTC students aiding
fire and police divisions, and cam
pus traffic, which dimiished only
slightly during the alert, as major
problems.

A. Spragen:. reported operations in
the control center, the Firehousc,
"ran smoothly." He said personnel
j reported 100 per cent, «ind commu
j nications to and from the command
