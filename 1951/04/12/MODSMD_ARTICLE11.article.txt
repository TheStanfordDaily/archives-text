# 'CHARACTERS'
## Search Is Rewarding 
### DICK FREDELL 
Six characters went in search
of an author on the stage of
Memorial Auditorium last night.
Though they didn't find him,
they did find a satisfactory pro
duction, gaining in interest after
a slow first act.
Wo refer, of course, to the Stanford
Studio Players' revival of Luigi
Pirandello's "Six Characters in
Search of an Author," in which a
rehearsal of another Pirandello play
is interrupted hy six characters, who
claim to hp the incomplete, aban
doned creations of the author's
imagination, and demand that they
he allowed to play out the unhappy
domestic drama which was never
written for them but is implied in
their lives.
All this serves as an ideal frame for
Playwright Pirandello's psycho
logical inquiries into the nature of
reality (and incidentally into the
validity of the theatre itself")â€¢ Since
we am constantly changing, we can
not. even know ourselves, much less
know others, yet we persist in classi
fying our fellow man on the basis of
our own incomplete (and conse
quently false) concept, of him.
Bcrai.-: e all of what we call
reality is therefore merely illusion,
the six characters, products of il
lusion, arc no less real than any
body else. It becomes unnecessary,
in this age of misunderstanding and
false concepts, to say that "Six
Characters" is even more timely
now than when first produced in
1921.
In presenting this play, it is essen
tial to draw a sharp distinction be
tween the actors themselves, the six
characters, and the actors when they
portray the characters, since the
point is that no one of these groups
is more real than (bp others. The
Stanford Players achieved this ef
fect. which is largely responsible for
the success of the production.
Addyse Lane brings to her role as
tho Stepdaughter a remarkably well
modulated voice. Always at her com
mand, it." brings nut perfectly the
subtle shadings in mood demanded
by her part.
In the play's most diflicult role,
Hugo Melchione is hard put to keep
his speeches from reading like
philosophical monologues. His ex
cessive gestures and too-quickly
exhausted inflections of voice hyp
notize the audience and draw at
tention from what he is saving.
Jock fie Casasus, as the Son, is
wooden, and Marjnrie Smith, as
Mother, is far too tormented, but F.
Maurice Der, nicely supplemented by
the rest of the Acting Company, gives
tho play balance and vitality.
"Six Characters" depends greatly
"n making thr> audience feel there
has been no striving for effect. Rut
William Oyler's direction never lots
us forget we are eavesdropping, that
be has indeed striven (and mightily
so) for effect. This is perhaps the
chief 112 ault of an otherwise above
average production.
