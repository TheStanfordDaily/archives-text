## 'Must Limit War to Korea' 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 11 (UP)
— President Truman said tonight

Arthur because "the cause of
world peace is much more im
portant than any individual."
In a major radio address, which
held out a new offer of Far East truce
negotiations, the President said this
country's aim is to prevent the Ko
rean fighting from spreading into a 11-
out war in Asia.
"A number of events have mad it
evident that General Mac Arthur did
not agree with that policy." he said.
"I have therefore considered it es.-nn
tial to relieve General MacArthui ,
that there would he no doubt or con -
fusion as to the real purpose and aim
of our policy."
Respect for Mac Arthur
Truman added that he consider ;
Mac Arthur "one of our greatest mili
tary commanders" and dismissed
him "with the deepest personal re
gret."
Truman acknowledged that Ihe
American pubic is asking itself why
the UN forces are not bombing Man
churia and China itself.
In answer, he said that if the demo
cratic forces assisted Chinese Na
tionalist troops in landing on ;'io
mainland of China, they will run a
very grave risk of starting a gene ral
war."
Truman, who was threatened v/ii i
impeachment in Congress for ousting
Mac Arthur, referred specifically 1 >
the general demand's for a free li.m l
to bomb Chinese Communist base in
Manchuria and to use Chiang I
Shek's Nationalist troops to opo.i i
second front on the Red China m. m
land.

"If we were to do these thing, "vr
would be runnng a very grave n !:
of starting a general war," he .id.
He added that nothing would suit ii
Kremlin better "than for our mill-
