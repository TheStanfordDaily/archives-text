# We Think It Will Work

### 
Tonight representatives from Ski Club, Al
pine Club, Hoedowners, and the Polo Associa
tion —4o name only a few—will hold a revival
meeting.
It won't be an old-fashioned revival. Strict
ly of'the constructive, new-tangled variety,
the clubs (there'll be 11 of 'em in all) will set
out to revive a "Co-Recreation Association"
at Stanford.
In years past, Stanford has had a Co-Rec. It's
purpose was to turn all the leisure time clubs
and associations on campus (activities which
involve both men and women) into a solid rec
reational program. In line with this goal, Co-
Rec was supposed to help its clubs with their
finances, their publicity campaigns, and their
membership drives. It was also dedicated to
"bringing out" latent campus interest in activi
ties not already organized, then organize them.
Evidently, it did none of these things to the
satisfaction of anybody.
The new Co-Flec which will be officially
horn tonight will have the same objectives as
its defunct parent. But to insure success
where failure has trod, the infant group has
planned sweeping changes• in its inner hier
archy.
In the past, it is agreed, every club belonging
to Co-Rec tried to get all it could from the or
ganization without contributing anything to its
support.
Today's Co-Rec, conversely, has drafted a
constitution which calls for an "Executive
Board" (the supreme governing body) made up
of eight people interested in the campus-wide
phase of Co-Recreation.
The eight will be: President, Secretary-
Treasurer, and Publicity Director of the Co-Rec
Association; ASSU Vice-President; ASSU Ath
letic Board Representative; Women's Athletic
Association President; Co-Rec's salaried ad
visor; and Chairman of the Co-Rec "Club Coun
cil."
The function of the last two members bears

definition. The former (Co-Rec's salaried ad
visor) is designed to be a college graduate
trained in recreation work. The advisor wil! be
paid to do all the paper work, advising, and a
large part of the co-ordination within the asso
ciation.
He will hold a torch for no one member
club. Quite the opposite, he will help each
club plan new activities, gain new members,
and generally "put itself over."
The latter member of the "executive board"
(Chairman of Co-Rec Council) will be elected
by the member clubs tonight. He will be their
official representative when the executive
board meets, and will toss out ideas and pro
posals that have come to his attention at the
meetings of the"Club Council" (composed of
the presidents of each member club).
That's the set-up. Financially—at least for the
rest of the current school year—Co-Rec should
be pretty well off, even without aid from WAA
and the Men's Athletic Department. (It used to
receive $500 a year from each.) Specifically, it
has $300 left over from the old Co-Rec which
died officially last year.
In addition, Dean of Students Donald Win
bigler has given strong indication that the
Administration will donate the first Co-Rec
paid advisor from its own ranks. This will be
done at no expense to the association.
Overall, the idea of a new, revitalized Co-Rec
has great possibilities. It can encourage the
formation of such new clubs as chess, handi
craft, reading, and ceramics, and even put the
Stanford Sailing Club—already partly formed
—on its list of lucrative prospects.
if you don't think people are
interested in co-recreational clubs at Stanford,
we ask you to look at the record. There are at
present 14 Co-Rec organizations on campus
with a combined membership of 1,165 students.
Believe it or not, that's one-seventh of the stu
dent body!
Aiid that's just a starting point, say the re
vivalists.
