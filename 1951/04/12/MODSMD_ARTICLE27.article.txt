# Coeds Outdo Men In Sleepless Studying
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
"To sleep; perchance to
dream!"
Ay, there's the rub with finals
just a few weeks past.
Sleep is socially proper, a
highly thought-of activity in the
eyes of parents, students, and
professors. But paradoxically
almost nothing is known about
this ancient custom.
Science doesn't know what it is,
! or the exact amount needed to keep
one going.
Speaking as a scientist, Dr.
Houck of the Stanford Health
Service said that people feel better,
J c : o better, and look better (especial
ly the girls) with "a certain
amount" of sleep.
What that certain amount is de
| pends on the individual, yet in the
long run a good night's sleep will
effect a better performance on the
next flay's exam than the usual all
night absorption of knowledge, with
| the aid of coffee and No-doz.
(The latter increases one's ability
to stay awake by increasing one's
! nervous tension. As for the am
phetamine drugs, benzedrine and
dexedrine, Dr. Houck said they
i should not be used.)
Beauty Sleep
There is a tendency, particularly
among women, to get mass hysteria
in the week preceding exams. Get
i ting into a tizzy and staying up all
night over a pile of books usually
j results in inefficiency rather than
physical harm. Dr. Houck added
that besides better marks, a good
| night's sleep would make the girls
look better.
The haggard faces of sleepy-eyed
females present a rather morbid
picture ol Stanford coeds during
finals week.
Men students seem to lead a nor
mal life during and preceding ex
| ams, and are much more sensible,
I commented the doctor.
Girls Worst Offenders
The girls are the worst offenders
j when it comes to giving up sleep
for cramming—in fact, four times as
many girls as boys suffer from lack
of sleep before and during finals.
As a final word to the wise, Dr.
Houck said that the smart student
| doesn't waste his time worrying; he
! gets a normal amount of sleep, and
! doesn't have to tak* drugs or ex
cess amounts of coffee.
Who wanted to study anyway?
Bon soir!

Ay, there's the rub with finals
just a few weeks past.
Sleep is socially proper, a
highly thought-of activity in the
eyes of parents, students, and
professors. But paradoxically
almost nothing is known about
this ancient custom.
Science doesn't know what it is,
! or the exact amount needed to keep
one going.
Speaking as a scientist, Dr.
Houck of the Stanford Health
Service said that people feel better,
J c : o better, and look better (especial
ly the girls) with "a certain
amount" of sleep.
What that certain amount is de
| pends on the individual, yet in the
long run a good night's sleep will
effect a better performance on the
next flay's exam than the usual all
night absorption of knowledge, with
| the aid of coffee and No-doz.
(The latter increases one's ability
to stay awake by increasing one's
! nervous tension. As for the am
phetamine drugs, benzedrine and
dexedrine, Dr. Houck said they
i should not be used.)
Beauty Sleep
There is a tendency, particularly
among women, to get mass hysteria
in the week preceding exams. Get
i ting into a tizzy and staying up all
night over a pile of books usually
j results in inefficiency rather than
physical harm. Dr. Houck added
that besides better marks, a good
| night's sleep would make the girls
look better.
The haggard faces of sleepy-eyed
females present a rather morbid
picture ol Stanford coeds during
finals week.
Men students seem to lead a nor
mal life during and preceding ex
| ams, and are much more sensible,
I commented the doctor.
Girls Worst Offenders
The girls are the worst offenders
j when it comes to giving up sleep
for cramming—in fact, four times as
many girls as boys suffer from lack
of sleep before and during finals.
As a final word to the wise, Dr.
Houck said that the smart student
| doesn't waste his time worrying; he
! gets a normal amount of sleep, and
! doesn't have to tak* drugs or ex
cess amounts of coffee.
Who wanted to study anyway?
Bon soir!
