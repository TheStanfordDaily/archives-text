## 
### 
A plan to eliminate winter
quarter elections for members
of the Council for Student Con
trol was given a green light by
Excom last night.
Approval for the plan, drawn
by the constitutional committee,
calling for the election of two
members each of Men's and
Women's Councils in the fall,
and three in the spring, was
unanimous. The committee will
formally present a constitutional
change allowing for the new
procedure at next week's meet
ing.
The Reason Why
The clod ion changes arc being
made in an attempt to stimulate stu
dent interest in the important Coun
cil races. Winter voting has been
extremely light.
Excom turned down another pro
posal intended to raise interest in
Council races. Phil Saeta, men's
halls representative, sponsored a
motion to includc this quarter's
Council races on the final ballot
April 25. Under the present system.
Council scats are decided on the
primary ballot.
Jack Hunter, Election Board
chairman, explained to Sacta that
experience had proved that greater
interest in Council elections result
ed when they were included in the
primaries.
"This eliminates the chance that
Council elections will be lost in the
shuffle of other ASSU offices which
are decided on the preferential sys
tem in the finals," he said.
Saeta countered by saying the ex
tra week of electioneering would
raise more intense interest on be
half of Council candidates, but he
was voted down, 9-4.
Finis for Rome
The final word on Derek Bok. the
Rome Conference delegate who
never got to Rome, was delivered by
ASSU President Ted Buttner.
"Bok simply couldn't get. his pass
port in time to go|" Buttner said.
Jean Evans was appointed by
Buttner to serve on the Grants-in-
Aid Commission.
Bill Bethke and Bill Fundenbcrg,
Men's Row and frosh representa
tives, respectively, were appointed
to next year's Relief Drive Commit
tee.
