### 
Mayor Elmer E. Robinson of San
Francisco has presented to Stanford
University a two-volume copy on
government treaty paper of the
Charter and Interim Arrangements
printed at the close of the United Na
tions Conference in San Francisco.
The presentation was made to
President Wallace Sterling of Stan
ford and Dr. Nathan van Patten, pro
fessor of bibliography.
The original edition of the publi
cation included 1074 copies, 367 on
rare government treaty paper and 707
on all-rag newspaper. All of these
are rare and only seven of the copies
on government treaty paper exist
out of the archives of the United Na
tions signatory powers. Dr. van Pat
ten feels that it is unlikely that any
will get into private hands.
Of the seven copics, one copy each
was given to Lord Halifax, Andrei
Gromyko, Wellington Koo, and for
mer Secretary of State Edward R.
Stettinius Jr.
Both volumes given to Stanford by
Mayor Robinson are bound in full
dark blue morocco with satin end
sheets and doublures. The copy con
tains the facsimile signatures of the
delegates and the certification of for
mer Secretary of State Stettinius at
the foot of the last page.
In 1940 Mayor Robinson established
at Stanford the Elmer E. Robinson
Collection of material on American
history to which he has made sub
stantial additions, including one of
the largest existing collections of
colonial and early American news
papers, which was acquired partly
with funds provided by him. Mayor
Robinson is honorary curator of
Americana in the Stanford Libraries.
