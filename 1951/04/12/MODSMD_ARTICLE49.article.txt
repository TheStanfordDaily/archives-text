## 
### 
Stanford's gridders got their first
real bumps yesterday afternoon as
Cuuch Chuck Taylor put the team
through a sharp scrimmage session.
Scrimmages will be the daily
menu for the Indians from now on.
Emphasis is being placed on rejuve
nating the Cards' running attack,
which suffered such a sad collapse
laet year, and fans who see the team
in the full-game scrimmages this
spring will probably have to wait
until full to see much of Gary Ker
korian's passing.
in Good Form
Harry Hugasian made several
fine runs, and seems to have re
gained his 1949 form. Among the
newcomers, halfback Bill Schei
deoker looks like he might carve
himself a niche on the '51 varsity.
On the defensive side of the
scrimmage several players from last
year's Papooses and Braves look
promising. Taylor was especially
pleased with the work of guard Dick
Borda and tackle Barry Smith.
A short passing drill was held
during which emphasis was placed
on pass defense, Backfield Coach
George Lynn starting work on lii.s
"back-pedaling" program.
Line Works on Traps
Ip offensive practice the line con
centrated on traps and pullouts, and
the backs on blocking. Several new
plays were introduced, with the ball
handling showing considerable iin-«
provement.
The practice ended with 25-yard
and 100-yard dashes for all players.
Among the linemen, centers Erick
Mack and Gordy Rice, tackles Ken
Downey, Leon King, and Bob La
tham, guard Norm Manoogian, and
end John Steinberg copped the hon
ors. Backfield results in the 100-
yard dash were as follows:
