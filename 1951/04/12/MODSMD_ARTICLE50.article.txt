# Mission Downs Frosh
## 
### 
Thirteen Indians died on the
basepaths as ihe frosh dropped their
first game of the year to powerful
Mission High, 4 to 2.
Mission jumped off to a quick
three-run lead, and the Cards spent
the rest of the game trying to catch
up. They threatened every inning,
but sloppy baserunning and failure
to hit in the clutch cost them the
ball game. • • •
Phil Page wont all the way and
pitched great ball eight-ninths of
the time. However, one Joe Delfino
seemed to have little trouble with
Page's slants as he crashed out two
home runs and a ground rule
double over the fence on four tries.
Page has now won four and lost
one.
Stanford scored in the third with
Olie Suzdaleff's single driving in the
run and in the fifth when Jack Ge
bert's blast drove in Joe Miller.
Today at 3:15 p.m., the frosh tan
gle with Bellarmine High. Don De
Long will hurl for Stanford.
