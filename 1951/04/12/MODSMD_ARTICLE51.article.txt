CHICAGO, April 11 (UP) â€”
Lightweight champion Ike Williams
jabbed holes in the dreams of Ca
nadian Fritzie Pruden for a welter
weight title chance tonight with a
sharply earned unanimous 10-round
decision before 2,897 fans in the
Chicago Stadium.
Williams, 10 pounds over the
lightweight limit at 145Vz pounds,
the same weight as Pruden, con
vinced his Ontario-born opponent
early in the bout that his chances to
win were slim. !
