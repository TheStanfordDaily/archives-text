# Bryan, Van Heusen, Parsons Set To Go

### 
Afterthoughts on last Saturday's
cinder disaster at Los Angeles. Sec
ond-place broad jumper Merrit Van
Sant made the best jump of his ca
reer at 24 ft. 3% in. and was four
times over 24 feet. UCLA's George
Brown passed the 24-foot marker
only once but the 24-ft. 9Vfe-in. ef
fort was enough to win top honors.
Little Drew Terramorse ran his
second fastest 880, a 1:56.8 clocking,
but it was only good for third.
Contrary to the opinion of some
Monday morning quarterbacks, Bob
Mathias couldn't have just grabbed
a pole and vaulted 11 feet or so
to get the empty third place in the
pole vault. The decathlon cham
pion's 205 pounds make him too
heavy for any ordinary pole, and he
had left his special pole at home.
Assistant Varsity Coach Ray Dean
says that three of the spikesters
who missed the UCLA meet will
compete in Saturday's home meet
with San Jose Slate and the Olym
pic Club. Bob Bryan's leg figures to
be healed sufficiently to do some
hurdling. Sprinter Maurice Parsons

and pole vaulter George Van Heu
sen will both see action.
Head Coach Jack Woiershauser
announced Tuesday that he would
send Wifbur Taylor in his first 440
of the season Saturday. Taylor has
confined his activities to the sprints
and relay to date.
Shot putter Lew Davis got off a
52-ft. 10-in. practice heave Monday,
setting the stage for the big "nat
ural" with former teammate Otis
Chandler who now competes for the
Olympic Club. Chandler hit about
52 I't. BV2 in. last weekend against
Cal.
