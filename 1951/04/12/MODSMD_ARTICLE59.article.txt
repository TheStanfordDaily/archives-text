## Midweek Musings Stanford Gains National Recognition 
### 
Stanley Woodward's "Who's Who in Sports" reached the news stands the
other day, and the number of Stanford names gracing the pages of tht
publication was gratifying indeed.
For instance, Woodward liked Bill McColl on his defensive All-American
and among the "best" players of the season (that's his only description 01
this group), he chose Russ Pomeroy, Gordy White, Bruce Van Alstyne, Boyt
Benson, and Gary Kerkorian.
Bob Mathias owns a full page of the magazine, dedicted to his picture anc
a short, but glowing, paragraph of description.
The edition's publication date apparently fell somewhere in mid-bas
ketball season, with the somewhat bizarre results testifying to the inad
visability of picking the season's stars in the heat of battle. Stanford' l "
only invasion of the list of cage stalwarts was in the personage of Ed
Tucker which we approve. But the list omitted such all-Coast perform
ers as Dick Kidgvvay, Jim Kamstead, and Tom Kiach—of which we don't
approve.
And—guffaw of the week—Woodward included the name (and picture) oi
Don Eby, Trojan bad boy who was more renowned for his need of a barbei
than for any outstanding court ability.
He also favored Floyd Layne and Ed Roman of CCNY and LlU's Sher
man White, all sitting behind bars by the time their selection was made
public.
Also, Woodward has apparently devised a new grid system. His All-
American offensive "eleven" has only ten men. Guess the ten are so good
they can do without the added strength.
All of which points on one fact: till u book full of names and pictures o!
athletes, and people will buy it, regardless. Like we did.
Ilolnian Fells His Pari in Cage Fix
CCNY cage-master Nat Ilolnian, in a recent letter to Everett Dean,
has this to say concerning the recent cage scandal: "Many people have
asked me why a person like myself, who has been so close to the game
throughout the years, was unable to recognize what the boys were doing.
My reply is simply this—that the person asking the question certainly
does not know anything about the game of basketball. I doubt whethei
any of us in the field tan detect mistakes and declare that they are
being made liy dishonest youngsters."
Old-timers department: Dave Field, former Card halfback who returned
this week to finish up some graduate work, has an interesting suggestion
He gags that he is thinking of applying to the conference for three mort
years 6f grid eligibility as an offensive player since he performed for Stan
ford three seasons strictly on defense. . . . Bill Larson, the red-head whr
was Stanford's top pole-vaulter for years and years and later served ti/c
Indian gridders as a trainer, is now a platoon leader in a Marine tank outfit,
with shipping-out time drawing nigh.
