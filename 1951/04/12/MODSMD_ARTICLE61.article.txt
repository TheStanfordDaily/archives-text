# Stanford's Pan Am Game Winner Back
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
The band played the Star Spangled
i Banner, and the eye:; of 10,000 Ar
gentines focused on the tall, wil
j lowy figure of a Roble girl.
The occasion was the Pan Ameri
can games in Buenos Aires, and the
subjcct was 17-year-old swim sen
sation Sharon Geary, Stanford's an
swer to legendary Ann Curtis. Sharon
had just churned to victory in the
j 100-meter free style to earn the first
I of three gold medals tnat were to
j come her way. She also spearheaded
the American medley and 400-meter
| relay teams to wins.
The 5 ft., 0 in., 130-pound Stanford
freshman is rated one of the bright
est woman swimming prospects to
come along in several years. Just the
other day, Swim Coach Tom Haynie
j said emphatically, "Bight now, Sha
j ron is as good as Ann Curtis. 1 think
l she has an excellent chance to win
I both the 100-metor free style and the
! back stroke in the 1952 Olympic:".."
Consistently Foster
Dark-eyed Sharon is con i: tcntly
J cutting down her time. At the Wo n
i en's Indoor Championships at Hous
! ton, Texas, last year, Sharon placed
! second to Jackie Lavine in the 100â€”
j meter free style. Her time w.-s 1:10.2.
I The Pan American games found her
I beating the same Jackie Lavinv in
I the time of 1:08.3. Constant im-
I provement like that puts the world
! record of 1:05.8 in jeopardy.
Sharon, a native of Long Beach,
! took her first plunge at the age of
j five. Swimming instructor Thelma
j Payne Sanborn tutored her until sh:
! came to Stanford, when Haynie took
j over. She works out every morning
i under Haynie's careful instruction,
| and swims from three-fourths of a
I mile to a mile a day.
Her oldest sister, Pat. a senior at
j Stanford, used to be a good racer,
hut she gave up mermaiding when
she came to the Farm.
She Snubbed I'cron
j Sharon snubbed the dictator Juan
) Peron while she was at the Pan
j American games, though not inten-
I tionally. In the opening procession,
j the Americans were supposed to face
! Peron when they passed his Lox for

courtesy reasons. All that Sharon
saw, however, was a sea of people,
no Sen or Peron, so when she passed
1 him she didn't even give him a nod. ;>
She was to have another indirect
run-in with the dictator of Argentina.
Sharon, was one of several of the
American group who hired a horse
drawn taxi one night. The entourage
was having a glorious time galloping
down the streets, when suddenly it
was halted by several indignant po
licemen. It seemed that Sharon and ;
her mates had made too much noise
when they passed a certain mansion,
and that it was important that the
dwellers in the mansion shouldn't
be disturbed. Who lived there? Juan
and Evita.
A Modest Girl
It's the rule rather than the ex
ception for femme swimmers to he t
, conceited. Rut not Sharon. Haynie
observed, "She is the most modest
and nicest girl swimmer I have ever
known. She shows real enthusiasm
for her work." I v
Pel low Roblcites will good-natur
edly shout, "Hey, star," or "celeb," J
and Sharon's red-faced reply will be, '
I "Aw, c'mon" or "Stop it."
Sharon, who has been invited to
swim in Hawaii this summer, is now |
competing in the Women's National
Indoor Championships in Texas.
