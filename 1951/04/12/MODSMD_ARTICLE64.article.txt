# Varsity, Frosh Swimmers Face Cal Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's biggest swimming spec- j
taclc will take place tomorrow in |
the Encina Pools, when the fresh- j
man and varsity teams tangle with I
their arch rivals from across the !
bay, the University of California.
'tile meet, which will start at 4 in i
the afternoon, will cost 80 cents for ;
a.iults, 50 cents for Stanford stu- j
dents, 00 cents for high school" and j
junior college .students, and .'JO cents '
for all chilurcn.
'I he Stanford varsity should
rack up its fifth dual meet win in
live starts this year against the
Cal squad, and double Cal's score
at the same time. Cal has its best
team in many years this year, hut
the Indians have what Tom May
nic tails "the best Stanford swim
ming team I've ever seen.'
Cal has tiny A 1 Lauderback in
the 220 and 440 freestyle; lie is Cal's
best distance freestyler since the
war. However, Lauderback, a soph- }
omore, may be brutally pushed
clown to third place in these two
events. Swimming the 220 for Stan
ford will be Pete Cole and Bobby
Thompson, who took fifth and sixth
in the NCAA meet in Austin.
In the quarter-mi!e, Pete Cole is
cxpected to lower his Meet rrc-»
ord of 4:5."] to somewhere around
4:42. Lauderback will have to fight
or second place in this race with
soph Bert Holiday of Stanford. Holi
day did 4:54 against Cal Poly last j
Friday, and the (i-foot 5-inch, 210-
pound soph didn't appear to be puf-ih- (
: ng himself. Lauc'erback's best tirrje
in this race i.s 4:52, done last v/eek |
against the Olympic Club. , j
Cal's Jim floss appears to be the j

only prospect for a first for the Bears
right now. Ross, a tall (6-5), lanky
soph, placed sixth in the NCAA 200-
yard backstroke, in 2:15, and Stan
ford's best in this race is Bruce Put
nam's 2:22. Putnam, according to
Coach Haynie, will not swim the
backstroke, but thr duo of Pierre
Hathaway and Dick Bennett will
attempt to place second and third
ahead of Cal's Brock Clark.
In the breast-stroke, the first three
men are likely to finish under the
Big Meet record, set by Stanford's
Don Hester, of 2:25.7. Bob Frojcn,
rated high among the nation's
brcaststrokcrs, has done 2:22.8, and
may very possibly break into the
2:21 bracket. Cal's Rod Lindquist
did 2:24 in the PCC last year, and
Ashley Jones of Stanford did 2:24
in his first meet.
