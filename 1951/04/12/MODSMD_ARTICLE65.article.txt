By PHIL WILCOX
The debate over the firing of
General Douglas Mac Arthur
from the Far Eastern Command,
which spread yesterday to every
corner of the United States, had
become a hot subject on the
Stanford campus by late eve
ning.
Notwithstanding an Associated j
Press report that newspapers all
over the country were being '
"swamped with telephone calls, the
vast majority backing Mac Arthur,"
the consensus on the Farm appeared
to he in favor of President Truman's
action in relieving Mac Arthur of his
duties.
Over coffee cups at the Cellar, in i
the campus living groups, and in the
classrooms, students and faculty j
members aired their views over !
what has been called the "most con- I
troversial issue in a decade" on the
United Press wire.
Several members of the faculty
contacted by The Daily were unan
imous in supporting Truman's ac
tion.
Professor Thomas A. Bailey of
the History Department stated:
"You can't have two drivers at
the wheel. Mar Arthur was in a
subordinate position to the Presi
dent. but refused to art according
to this position. It was like hav
ing two foreign policies. . . Ho
obviously felt that Asia should
he our first concern. Washington

1 I
j felt otherwise. 1 have faith in the
i American people to hack up the
administration in its 'Europe first'
foreign polirj."
Associate Professor Robert Walk
j er of the Political Science Depart- j
ment said in a similar vein, "From j
| an administrative viewpoint, there j
is no question about Truman's justi- J
fication in firing Mac Arthur. By
i carrying on a public debate, Mac-
Arthur gave the President little
choice unnn the matter. . . . Mac-
Arthur went outside regular chan
: nels in his disagreement."
Robert W. Tucker, also of the
Political Scicnce Department, pre
dicted an extremely bitter party
conflict over the firing. "However,
Tucker said, "there is no particular
principle involved. I think a Re
publican President in the same sit
j uation would have had 'to do the
I same thing."
Visiting Professor Kazuo Kawai
! said, "Spcakin" as a Japanese, I
! think Mac Arthur did a great job
as occupation leafier in Japan. As ?
military leader in Korea lie has at
times been brilliant and at othei
times faulty in his judgment. But I
; feel that he should have voiced hi*
' disagreement with the administra
j tion in the regular way and because
his method was wrong, I think his
firing was justified.
"The Japanese have great con
fidence in him. and this will be a
great f-hoek to them," he said.
The opinions of several students
who were interviewed generally co-
I incided with those of the faculty
| members.
Carl Stover, ASSU Forum Com
| bymittec member, said, "I am en
j couraged by the constructive lead
ership shown by President Truman
j in reaffirming the supremacy of ci
vilian leadership over the military
in matters of foreign policy and
hope the action will provide an op
j portunity for the successful negotia
tion of Far Eastern difficulties !
I through the United Nations."
11R president Tom Bartlett said
j that he was generally in favor of the
move. "The dismissal might have
| been done more discreetly, but defi
i nitely did aid us in our relations
with our allies, especially Great
Britain and France," Bartlett said.
Ted Frame, resident assistant at
Toyon Hall, stated there are

two factors which make him in
favor of the Presidential action.
"First of all," said Frame, "it will
make for a more united front in
the Far Fast. Secondly, the move
is a positive assertion of civilian
power over the military which I
believe is essential to our demo
cratic system," he said.
Carolyn Craig, junior at Union,
was critical of Truman's action. She ,
?aid, "Truman tried to preserve in
ternal discipline by his action . . .
but Mac Arthur is almost the only
man qualified to handle the Far
Eastern military situation,"
ASSU Business Manager Dave [
Elliot said, "The thing that inter
ested me was that this is the first
real positive step Truman has made
since lie has been in office. Only
history will show whether he was
right or wrong."

is a positive assertion of civilian

Carolyn Craig, junior at Union,

The debate over the firing of
General Douglas Mac Arthur
from the Far Eastern Command,
which spread yesterday to every
corner of the United States, had
become a hot subject on the
Stanford campus by late eve

Notwithstanding an Associated j
Press report that newspapers all
over the country were being '
"swamped with telephone calls, the
vast majority backing Mac Arthur,"
the consensus on the Farm appeared
to he in favor of President Truman's
action in relieving Mac Arthur of his
duties.
Over coffee cups at the Cellar, in i
the campus living groups, and in the
classrooms, students and faculty j
members aired their views over !
what has been called the "most con- I
troversial issue in a decade" on the

Tucker said, "there is no particular
principle involved. I think a Re
publican President in the same sit
j uation would have had 'to do the
I same thing."
Visiting Professor Kazuo Kawai
! said, "Spcakin" as a Japanese, I
! think Mac Arthur did a great job
as occupation leafier in Japan. As ?
military leader in Korea lie has at
times been brilliant and at othei
times faulty in his judgment. But I
; feel that he should have voiced hi*
' disagreement with the administra
j tion in the regular way and because
his method was wrong, I think his
firing was justified.
"The Japanese have great con
fidence in him. and this will be a
great f-hoek to them," he said.
The opinions of several students
who were interviewed generally co-
I incided with those of the faculty
| members.
Carl Stover, ASSU Forum Com
| bymittec member, said, "I am en
j couraged by the constructive lead
ership shown by President Truman
j in reaffirming the supremacy of ci
vilian leadership over the military
in matters of foreign policy and
hope the action will provide an op
j portunity for the successful negotia
tion of Far Eastern difficulties !
I through the United Nations."
11R president Tom Bartlett said
j that he was generally in favor of the
move. "The dismissal might have
| been done more discreetly, but defi
i nitely did aid us in our relations
with our allies, especially Great
Britain and France," Bartlett said.
Ted Frame, resident assistant at
Toyon Hall, stated there are

two factors which make him in
favor of the Presidential action.
"First of all," said Frame, "it will
make for a more united front in
the Far Fast. Secondly, the move
is a positive assertion of civilian
power over the military which I
believe is essential to our demo
cratic system," he said.
Carolyn Craig, junior at Union,
was critical of Truman's action. She ,
?aid, "Truman tried to preserve in
ternal discipline by his action . . .
but Mac Arthur is almost the only
man qualified to handle the Far
Eastern military situation,"
ASSU Business Manager Dave [
Elliot said, "The thing that inter
ested me was that this is the first
real positive step Truman has made
since lie has been in office. Only
history will show whether he was
right or wrong."
