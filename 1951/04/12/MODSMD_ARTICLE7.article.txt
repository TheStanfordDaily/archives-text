# Boards 'May' Get Power to Defer
## 
### 
The latest draft developments were interpreted for the more
than 100 students who attended the first Senior Vocational Com
mittee program of the quarter in Cubberley Auditorium at 7:30
last night.
Richard L. Balch, chief counselor for men, explained the presi-

dential executive order signed March
31. Balch only recently received a
copy of the executive order.
Also participating in the program
were Eugene W. Dils, director of the
Stanford Placement Service, and of
ficers from each of the four Stanford
ROTC programs. Don Weeden, Sen
ior Vocom chairman, presided.
Baich said that according to the
wording of the executive order, it
appeared individual draft boards
would have discretion in the inter
pretation and application of defer
ment criteria.
The ambiguity in the executive
order comes from a "may" clause.
The "may" clause implies that indi
vidual draft hoards have the au
thority to defer students on the basis
of the aptitude test, on the basis of
class standing, or on the basis of a
combination of these factors.
Further clarification rests with
Washington, Balch said. Students
must pass the aptitude test with a
score of 70 (75 for graduate students
or seniors entering graduate work),j
or by being in the upper half of the :
freshman class, upper 2/3 of the
sophomore class, upper 3/4 of the
junior class, or upper half of the
senior class.
Balch urged all draft eligiblcs
who intend to continue their edu
cation as graduate or undergradu
ate students to immediately apply
to their looal draft hoards for per
mission to take the May 26 apti
tude test.
Hr said all men in classifications j
1-A, 1-A-P, and 2-A, and ROTC !
students who have not qualified for
their 1-D classification, should apply.
Application to take the test must
be made to the draft board which has '
classified the student. The draft j
board's address is on each student's |
draft card.
The test on May 26 is the first of j
three aptitude tests which will be!
given by the Educational Testing
Service of Princeton, New Jersey, j
The other two tests will be given on !
June 16 and June 30.
According to a testing service
announcement, 500 Stanford stu
dents will he allowed to take the
first test, he said.
Balch said the first 500 to send ap
plications to the testing service will
be allowed to take the first test. Ap- j
plicants who file after that will be !
directed to take the second or third !
test.
The process for applying to take the
test is as follows:
1. Write your individual draft
board requesting permission to take j
the test. The draft hoard will screen
your application to certify that you
are registered in a University.
If students haven't had certification
of their attendance at Stanford sent
to their draft boards, Balch said not
to apply to take the test. Cortifica- ;
tion must be obtained first.
2. After screening, your draft
board will send you an application
form. This Form, a double post card, '
is to he filled out and dropped in the j
mail box. It is already addressed.
Balch said students should indi
cate, on the application, where they I
will be on June 16 and June 30. This
is so the testing service can schedule j
students to take the test near their
residence if they are not at school.

3. The testing service, which will j
receive the application cards, will in- |
dicate where and when the student
will take the test. Half the card will
be detached and returned to the stu- j
dent with this information on it.
The May 26 test will he given in
II rooms of the History Building.
Dr. John Black, head of the Voca
tional Guidance and Testing Serv
ice, will announce room assign
ments and the time of the test prior
to the examination date.
The aptitude test will be a three- j
hour test of the student's ability to j
learn on a college level, a Testing
Service announcement said. There is j
no need to bone up. Most of the test
will be reading and comprehension.
Students who intend to graduate in
June should apply for a 30-day grace J
period for the purpose of entering an I
essential industry or entering the
armed force of their choice, Balch
said.
The grace period is not auto
matic, he said, and students must
apply to their local draft boards to
obtain it.
Balch said men classified 2-A who i
have additional graduate or under
graduate work to complete need not
apply for the grace period until after
they have been reclassified 1-A.
Speakers for the ROTC programs '
were Lt. Col. Clifford Quilici for the j
Marine Corps Reserve program; I
Commander G. F. Gugliotta, execu- j
tive officer of the Stanford NROTC; !
Lt. Col. Robert O. Graham, ROTC; j
and Lt. Col. Charles Moss, ROTC.
All four said service jobs in their [
respective fields were as diversified t
as civilian jobs.
