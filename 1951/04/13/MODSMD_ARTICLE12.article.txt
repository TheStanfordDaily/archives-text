cinder squad, still reeling from
last weekend's "upset" by UC
LA, will go into tomorrow's
three-way meet with San Jose
State and the Olympic Club
facing the possibility of being
"upset" twice again.
The final prep for the next two
weeks' "Biggies" with Occidental and
USC respectively will be run off in

spikesters out for various reasons.
Dash man Ronnie Buck hasn't

suffering from an ear infection and
will probably limit his activity to the
relay.
