Jack Weiershauser's varsity
cinder squad, still reeling from
last weekend's "upset" by UC
LA, will go into tomorrow's
three-way meet with San Jose
State and the Olympic Club
facing the possibility of being
"upset" twice again.
The final prep for the next two
weeks' "Biggies" with Occidental and
USC respectively will be run off in
Stanford Stadium, the field events
beginning at 1:30 and the running
events at 2.
The Indians will still be far from
full strength, with probably five
spikesters out for various reasons.
Dash man Ronnie Buck hasn't
worked out all week and probably
won't compete for some time. Discus
thrower Ian Reed is having a tonsil
lectomy Monday and it is still ques
tionable whether or not he will com
pete. Half miler Joss Scroggy is
suffering from an ear infection and
will probably limit his activity to the
