# While We Wait and Hope...

### 
Atom bombs and 69 cents a pound lor ham
burger, dralt news as permanent as a col
lapsible chair, germ warlare and what the
hell are we lighting lor. A purpose in life,
don't moke me laugh. . . . 1951.
"We can't do anything," the student in the
Cellar said. "We can wait—and the Army'll
put guns in our hands; we can hope — and
.someone will blow us up; we can think —and
everyone will laugh at us. Human dignity in an
atomic age? Like hell!"
The notion that the world was round was
Baloney. The idea that men could fly was Nuts.
The theory that the universe did not revolve
around the earth was Monstrous. The idea that
a human being is a necessary part even of an
atomic age is—possible.
A group of learned men think he is. Leaders

in our University, this afternoon they are going
to discuss the individual and what he can do in
this time of tension. They do not feel the indi
vidual is too weighted down by metal ma
chines, advanced technology, and theories of
radiation to be important.
"Talk," said the student in the Cellar said,
"just talk."
Yet before we can do anything. we must
know what we think. 11 we do not, we are
like a paramecium stabbing forward into
darkness without knowing where we are
going. These men are wise. By tiring ques
tions at them, by arguing with them, we will
think.
Listening and thinking may stabilize values
in this crooked world of 1951.
The student conference is open to you.
