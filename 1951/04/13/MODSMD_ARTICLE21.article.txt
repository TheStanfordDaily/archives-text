### EARL ODELL 
year one Alvin Berry suggested, in this col
umn, that Stanford authorities dig up Inner Quad and
install a swimming pool with equipment to freeze
over the pool in the winter for ice skating.
So what happened? Nothing! A pity, for it indeed

had its merits.
Not so long ago your humble
■ervant (now doesn't that sound
nice?) made a suggestion for
transforming Lake Lagunita into
a Waikiki Beach of Stanford. I
even went so far as to explain in
great detail —people who run uni
versities have to have pictures
drawn for them sometimes —just

what had to be done and how to do it.
So what happened? Immediately, Stanford officials
started jumping. I haven't checked on the details, but
1 suspect that the Board of Trustees jumped all over
President Sterling for being a lunkhead not to have
thought of such a great idea before, and then Mr.
Sterling probably phoned ASSU prexy Ted Buttner
telling him what a blockhead he was, not to have
thought of such ijt great idea before. After which Butt
ner probably tore over to tell ASSU Student Man
ager Dave Elliott what a knucklehead he was not to
have thought of such a great idea and why he didn't
• tart to work on it right away.
The reaction to this great and glorious scheme .sug

gests two possibilities: (1) The power ol the Stanford
Daily is limitless and everyone quakes with fear lest
Donald E. Close become Editor, or (2) I'm a genius.
My mother, bless her soul, is probably the only one
who woidd dare tell the truth.
At any rate plans are now under way to clear a
space on the south side of the Boathouse for a sand
beach. Perhaps they'll put up a statue of me for my
relentless work on this project. However, I'm modest,
so a bust will do.
I wish to remind Elliott and his gang, though, that
putting the sand in doesn't finish the job. If he'll re
call, I put forth the further suggestion that the palm
trees on Palm Drive be transplanted in the sand after
a stupendous ceremony following a parade of two
dozen fire-engine-Cadillacs dragging the trees to the
Lake.
Due to the war emergency, I know how tough it is
to get fire-engine-red Cadillacs these days—I'm the
understanding sort —so, Dave, I want you to know that
it'll be o.k. with me if you use white Oldsmobiles.
It'll give the trees a pure, virgin touch, anyway.
And, Dave, don't forget the hula girls who will be
dancing under the palm trees at all times. I'm going
to get going on that little hula project right away.
In fact, if any girls are interested in learning the hula,
please meet me on Inner Quad at midnight on any
moonlit night. I'll provide the accompaniment.

ager Dave Elliott what a knucklehead he was not to
have thought of such a great idea and why he didn't

The reaction to this great and glorious scheme .sug

gests two possibilities: (1) The power ol the Stanford
Daily is limitless and everyone quakes with fear lest
Donald E. Close become Editor, or (2) I'm a genius.
My mother, bless her soul, is probably the only one
who woidd dare tell the truth.
At any rate plans are now under way to clear a
space on the south side of the Boathouse for a sand
beach. Perhaps they'll put up a statue of me for my
relentless work on this project. However, I'm modest,
so a bust will do.
I wish to remind Elliott and his gang, though, that
putting the sand in doesn't finish the job. If he'll re
call, I put forth the further suggestion that the palm
trees on Palm Drive be transplanted in the sand after
a stupendous ceremony following a parade of two
dozen fire-engine-Cadillacs dragging the trees to the
Lake.
Due to the war emergency, I know how tough it is
to get fire-engine-red Cadillacs these days—I'm the
understanding sort —so, Dave, I want you to know that
it'll be o.k. with me if you use white Oldsmobiles.
It'll give the trees a pure, virgin touch, anyway.
And, Dave, don't forget the hula girls who will be
dancing under the palm trees at all times. I'm going
to get going on that little hula project right away.
In fact, if any girls are interested in learning the hula,
please meet me on Inner Quad at midnight on any
moonlit night. I'll provide the accompaniment.

year one Alvin Berry suggested, in this col
umn, that Stanford authorities dig up Inner Quad and
install a swimming pool with equipment to freeze
over the pool in the winter for ice skating.
So what happened? Nothing! A pity, for it indeed

had its merits.
Not so long ago your humble
■ervant (now doesn't that sound
nice?) made a suggestion for
transforming Lake Lagunita into
a Waikiki Beach of Stanford. I
even went so far as to explain in
great detail —people who run uni
versities have to have pictures
drawn for them sometimes —just

what had to be done and how to do it.
So what happened? Immediately, Stanford officials
started jumping. I haven't checked on the details, but
1 suspect that the Board of Trustees jumped all over
President Sterling for being a lunkhead not to have
thought of such a great idea before, and then Mr.
Sterling probably phoned ASSU prexy Ted Buttner
telling him what a blockhead he was, not to have
thought of such ijt great idea before. After which Butt
