### 
"Six Characters in Search of an
Author," which opened Wednesday
night at Memorial Auditorium, will
run through tonight and tomorrow
night.
The play has been produced and
directed by William Oyler, a grad
uate in the Department of Speech
and Drama at Stanford. He has di
rected it as a project for his Mas
ter's thesis.
Starred in "Six Characters in
Search of an Author" are Hugo
Melchione as the Father; Addyse
Lane, the Stepdaughter; Marjorie
Smith, the Mother; and Maurice
Dee, the Stage Manager.
The play was written by the Ital
ian Luigi Pirandello in 1921. When
first produced in Italy it caused a
riot in the streets because of its
controversial subject matter.
Oyler is presenting his play with
central staging. The audience will
sit upon the stage in a small circle
of tiered seats. The action of the
play will be presented within this
small circle.
