# Honors Program in Humanities Aims at Integration Within Field
## 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
Wednesday night Professor John W. Dodds, chairman of the
Honors Program in Humanities, announced the addition of a new
major in Humanities to the Stanford curriculum.
The Humanities major has grown out of, and is designed to be
parallel to the present Honors Program in Humanities, a little

known program, purpose of which
i.s to give its members directed work
planned to integrate the humanities
field.
To Combat Specialization
This program was inaugurated on
the Farm three years ago to combat
the growing educational trend to
ward specialization. In the words of
Professor Dodds:
"It aims to develop a greater sense
of the interrelatedness of the many
strands that make up our knowl
edge and experience, and to make
the students more aware of basic
valuesâ€” intellectual, aesthetic, so
cial, and ethical."
In the program, students in all
branches of the humanities follow a
course of study which ties in their
major field with other related fields.
Thus, students majoring in English
might take courses in art, music,
philosophy, political science; "and
econ, trying to relate them to Eng
lish.
Program in Two Parts
The program is made up of two
parts: a group of foundation courses
related to the regular lower division
requirements (these include courses,
such as philosophy and line arts,
which are open to everybody, and
others, such as the Humanities Col
loquium, which are open only to
students in the program); and a
more specialized interdepartmental
program growing out of the stu
dent's major, but reaching into re
lated fields.
During his senior year the stu
dent takes a seminar which enables
him to work with students of differ
ent departments.
So that the student may draw to
gether for himself some of the in
terests he has developed in the pro
gram, he writes an essay of ten to
fifteen thousand words during his
senior year.
To complete his study he is given
an oral examination covering the
field of his senior essay.
Students, Faculty Enthusiastic
Students and faculty alike are
enthusiastic about the program.
One course especially, the new
Humanities Colloqium, has aroused

a great deal of interest. Each week '
the class, which is kept small for i
purposes of free discussion, analyzes |
a great document or work of art in !
terms of a general theme for the
quarter.
To help keep the personal ele
ment in the program, students and
the members of the Honors Com
mittee meet about twice a quarter
to discuss some subject of general
interest.
Recently, Professor Davidson of
Harvard, who gave a Tuesday Eve
ning talk, spoke to the humanities
students on "Music in Education."
Fall quarter the Stanford Players
gave a special performance of
Anouilh's "Antigone" for the group.
After the production, play director
John Clark gave a lecture on the
atrical technique, redoing scenes
from the play for demonstration.
These informal meetings are often
held in the home of one of the di
rectors, and doughnuts and coffee
are usually served.
