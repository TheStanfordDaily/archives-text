# Crew Starts Season Against PCC Clubs
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Just how good is this year's
Stanford crew? Tomorrow's sea
son opener, the Newport Regat
ta, against Cal, UCLA, and USC
should provide a fast answer.

The varsity competition starts
at 3:30 p.m., and is preceded by
the junior varsity clash at 2 p.m.
This new addition to Coast row
[ ing will mark the first time college
\ crews have competed at Newport,
j and also the first time the four
j schools have met in the same race.
The course will be 2,000 meters
j alon« the North Lido Channel.
The Trojans and Bruins, only re
cent additions to Pacific rowing, are
not expected to be too tough. Stan
lord defeated both shells last year.
But Cal, under Ky Ebright, has been
a national contender for years. The
Bears were world champions when
they won the 48 Olympics at Hen
! ley. Last year at Marietta, Ebright's
crew placed right behind the win
ning Washington Huskies.
Cal lost several from its first
eight, but with a round of four
tough races in Australia and New
Zealand, the Bears are way ahead
of the usual training schedule. Since
dropping some races in the "Down
Under" lands, Ebright has switched
four new men into the first boating.
For the Indians, Coach Jim Beggs
has had plenty of trouble getting his
first shell set and in shape. Veteran
Don Craven is still missing, having
failed to recover from a recent case
oi pneumonia. Bill Meyer has been
i moved to No. 5 spot to give more
| power in the middle of the shell.
Although the Card time trials
have not been too sensational, Beggs
j has been pleased with the timing
of the first shell and also seems
quite sure the Cards are capable of
real power at the higher strokes.
An indication of the real potential
; should be gained as the Cards chase
( after the Bears over the mile-and-
J a-quarter distance.
■ Regatta officials expect a big
crowd. In order to help the spec
tators, oar tip colors have been as
signed to each school that will
clearly identify each shell. To add
to the general color of the event,
all boats in the harbor will be "lull
i dress ship" for the day.
