# Horsehiders Meet State, Then Alumni
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Ev Dean's nine little Indians, with J
one eye on their own scoreboard j
and one on that of the league-lead
ing USC Trojans, will meet San I
Jose State today and the alumni
team tomorrow. Both games will be
played on home grounds and will
begin at 3:15 p.m..
Needless to say, the Cards will be
playing with their fingers crossed, i
hoping that the Santa Clara Bron- j
cos can knock over the Trojans this
weekend and thus keep the Cards!
in the thick of the fight. But nev- ;
ertheless, the locals can't be caught j
looking too far around the corner j
as both their opponents are sure to
be rugged.
San Jose has dropped two games |
to the Indians, one close and one j
not so close, but there's nothing |
they would rather do than gain [
some measure of revenge in dump- j
ing the Cards in their final outing j
against them.
Leading Coach Walt Williams' I
crew are infielders Joe Bonfiglio at j
third, Captain Walt Johnson at sec
ond, and El Hallberg at first. All
are hitting well over .300. Basket- !
ball star Dean Giles is proving to [
be quite an outfielder along with j
the Spartans' leading hitter, Andy ;
Miller, who's clouting a lusty .389. \
T o m o rrow's opponents, the
alums, will boast a lineup filled
with Stanford diamond greats of
the past, with infielder Bobby
Brown of the New York Yankees
leading the list.
Singing Ray Hammett will return
to his old first base post, Assistant
Varsity Coach Bill Allhouse will be
at second, and Buddy Klein of last
year's CIBA champs will be in left.
Last season Buddy led the Cards in i
just about every hitting department j
and is also quite an outfielder.
Teammate John Claypool will be in
center, and fireballer Jack Heinen.
now pitching for the San Jose Red
Sox, will be on the mound. He'll
throw to Leo Heagerty, who played
quite a bit of pro ball.
Others signed to play by Mana
ger Bob Burnett will be hurler
Cootie Thompson, probably the
greatest collegiate hurler on the
Coast in his day; Ward Walkup, all-
CIBA catcher under Harry Wolter;
Bob Larson and Jim Mason, who
both performed as utility men on
last year's club; Blasting Bob Nava
and George Sloat of the 1048 out
field; and pitchers Dick Armstrong,
Eil Shive, Jack Miller ,and Harry
Dyck. Buddy Gmur and Glenn
Hamilton round out the alumni ros
ter.
During the last week Coach
Dean has been doing more exper
imenting than an atomic chemist,
and whiie there will he no re
placements on a Mac Arthur scale,
some changes may be made. Spe
cial attention has liecn given to
outfichlcr-inficldcr Jim A,;ar, who
can hit a counlvy mile hut is both
ered bv a weak throwing arm.
Dean wants Agar in the lineup,
and with considerable work Agar's
arm is developing.
Baskctballer George Zaninovich
has also been impressive with his
; tremendous throwing ability, and
| the coaching moguls are debating
just what to do with Georgie. Third
baseman Dick Cole also has been
given the hard-work treatment in
an effort to cut down on his fielding

miscues. There's nothing wrong '
with his hitting, as opposing pitch
ers will testify, but recently he's
been a bit loose in the fielding de
partment.
