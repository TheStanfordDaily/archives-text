## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
It will be Stanford against Cal today in what should be the most
entertaining but not the closest dual swimming meet of the home
season. The meet will take place at 4 this afternoon in the Encina
Pools.
Admission will be 80 cents for adults, 60 cents for high school

and junior college students, 50 cents
for Stanford students, and 30 cents
for all children.
Distance Itaces Close
The 220 and 440 freestyle races
will be spotlighted in today's meet.
Cal Coach George Schroth an
nounced yesterday that he will
swim his ace Bill Phillips along with
soph star A1 Lauder back in the 220,
in an attempt to break up the Stan
ford combination of Pete Cole and
Bobby Thompson. In the quarter
mile, Cole and Bert Holiday will vie
against Lauderbaek.
Tom Haynie, Stanford's coach, has
announced that the freshman and
varsity meets will be run off si
multaneously, giving local swim
ming fans two meets for the price
of one.

The Indians have a good chance
to shut out the Bears in both free- !
style sprints. In the 50, Cal's best is |
Jim Chapman, who does about 24.8. I
Haynie will swim Chuck Kelly
(regularly 24.2) and Bob Wycoff
(consistently 24.5).
100 Is Toss-lip
Phillips and Chapman will go for
Cal in the 100, against the duo of
Bruce Putnam and Bobby Thomp
son. Phillips' best is 53.5, while
Putnam has been timed at 52.0 and
Thompson at 52.7 in recent meets.
The only first that California can
count on is big Jim Ross in the 200
backstroke. Ross is 15 seconds bet
ter than Stanford's best, Pierre
Hathaway and Dick Bennett.
In the breaststroke, Stanford's
Bob Frojen must be given the pre
meet edge. Frojen has done 2:22.8,
and is expected to better this time
tomorrow. The race for second
place should be very close between
Cal's Rod Lindquist and the Cards'
Ashley Jones. Both have done 2:24,
but both are doing about 2:27 at
this time.
Glathe Favored
Palo Alto's Bill Glathe, among
the ten best divers in the country, is
given a definite edge over Dick Pol
lock of the Bears in the fancy flips
and turns department. Glathe, one
time Pacific Association men's div
ing champ, scores around 345 points
in all his meets, while Pollock, who
does all the dives but lacks Glathe's
grace and ability in execution, usu
ally hits about 300 points.
Both relays are expected to be
won by the red-suited swimmers.
In the medley relay, the meet rec
ord of 2:57.2 may fall to the team
of Putnam, Frojen, and Holiday.
This team, with the substitution of
Thompson for Holiday, took third
in the NCAA meet at Austin.

Cal, which has five good swim- '
mers and no depth, is weak in the
freestyle relay, and • Stanford's sec-;
ond team of the Mowat brothers, j
John and George, Alan Marsh, and
Phil Chapman is slightly favored
over Cal's aggregation of Phillips, I
Ross, Cook, and Jim Chapman.
Stanford's freshman team, paced
by Jim Caughran, Jim Lee, Lee
Gunnerson, Roger Moore, and Dave
Taylor, is expected to make it a
double win for the Indians.

ord of 2:57.2 may fall to the team
of Putnam, Frojen, and Holiday.
This team, with the substitution of
Thompson for Holiday, took third
in the NCAA meet at Austin.

Cal, which has five good swim- '
mers and no depth, is weak in the
freestyle relay, and • Stanford's sec-;
ond team of the Mowat brothers, j
John and George, Alan Marsh, and
Phil Chapman is slightly favored
over Cal's aggregation of Phillips, I
Ross, Cook, and Jim Chapman.
Stanford's freshman team, paced
by Jim Caughran, Jim Lee, Lee
Gunnerson, Roger Moore, and Dave
Taylor, is expected to make it a
double win for the Indians.
It will be Stanford against Cal today in what should be the most
entertaining but not the closest dual swimming meet of the home
season. The meet will take place at 4 this afternoon in the Encina
Pools.
Admission will be 80 cents for adults, 60 cents for high school

and junior college students, 50 cents
for Stanford students, and 30 cents
for all children.
Distance Itaces Close
The 220 and 440 freestyle races
will be spotlighted in today's meet.
Cal Coach George Schroth an
nounced yesterday that he will
swim his ace Bill Phillips along with
soph star A1 Lauder back in the 220,
in an attempt to break up the Stan
ford combination of Pete Cole and
Bobby Thompson. In the quarter
mile, Cole and Bert Holiday will vie
against Lauderbaek.
Tom Haynie, Stanford's coach, has
announced that the freshman and
varsity meets will be run off si
multaneously, giving local swim
ming fans two meets for the price
of one.

The Indians have a good chance
to shut out the Bears in both free- !
style sprints. In the 50, Cal's best is |
Jim Chapman, who does about 24.8. I
Haynie will swim Chuck Kelly
(regularly 24.2) and Bob Wycoff
(consistently 24.5).
100 Is Toss-lip
Phillips and Chapman will go for
Cal in the 100, against the duo of
Bruce Putnam and Bobby Thomp
son. Phillips' best is 53.5, while
Putnam has been timed at 52.0 and
Thompson at 52.7 in recent meets.
The only first that California can
count on is big Jim Ross in the 200
backstroke. Ross is 15 seconds bet
ter than Stanford's best, Pierre
Hathaway and Dick Bennett.
In the breaststroke, Stanford's
Bob Frojen must be given the pre
meet edge. Frojen has done 2:22.8,
and is expected to better this time
tomorrow. The race for second
place should be very close between
Cal's Rod Lindquist and the Cards'
Ashley Jones. Both have done 2:24,
but both are doing about 2:27 at
this time.
Glathe Favored
Palo Alto's Bill Glathe, among
the ten best divers in the country, is
given a definite edge over Dick Pol
lock of the Bears in the fancy flips
and turns department. Glathe, one
time Pacific Association men's div
ing champ, scores around 345 points
in all his meets, while Pollock, who
does all the dives but lacks Glathe's
grace and ability in execution, usu
ally hits about 300 points.
Both relays are expected to be
won by the red-suited swimmers.

ord of 2:57.2 may fall to the team
