# Blood Tests Show Alcoholic Content
## 
### 
Blood analyses arc a more reliable
indication of intoxication than
chemical tests of a suspcctcd drunk
en driver's breath.
This was the view given here
Wednesday night in a popular med
ical lecture by Dr. Henry W. New
man, Stanford Medical School neu
ro-psychiatrist, who warned, how
ever, that even a blood test should
be supported by other evidence.
'A blood analysis, when done
competently," he continued, "proves
definitely how much alcohol an in
dividual has consumed, and at least
docs away with the standard alibi
so familiar to traffic court judges,
'I just had a couple of beers'."
The talk, on "Alcoholic Intoxica
tion," was the second in a series of
weekly popular medical lectures
during the month of April at Stan
ford Medical School.
