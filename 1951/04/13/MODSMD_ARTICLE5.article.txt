Balch asked students not to rush
cause of the present limited supply
of blanks available.
He said San Mateo had only 100
forms and San Jose 150, but that
San Jose has ordered 8,000 applica
tion blanks and expects to get them
next Tuesday.
Students going to a draft board for
an application must present their
studer/ body cards and evidence of
their age. A driver's license is suf

Balch phoned the selective service
office in Sacramento yesterday and
asked permission to distribute appli
cation blanks on campus for Stanford
students.
The selective service office replied
that the distribution of blanks had
already been made and could not be
changed. It added that an additional
supply of blanks bad been sent to the
San Jose Selective Service Board to
handle the demand in this area.
Between 2,000 and 2,500 students
at Stanford will need test applica
tion blanks. Raich said.
Balch said waiting until San Jose
gets the 8.000 blanks will not jeop
ardize the student's chance of taking
the May 26 test.
Students desiring to take the test
must intend to request, their own
draft board for occupational defer
ments as students, be under 26 at
i the time of the test, be satisfactorily

I loading to a degree, and must not
I previously have taken the test.
The test will be given at Stan
ford at S:!50 a.m. May 26, June 16,
and June 30.

cessary before mailing.
The number of the center where
the student desires to take the test,
must be filled out on the application
form for all three tests dates. Stan
ford's designation is 135.
