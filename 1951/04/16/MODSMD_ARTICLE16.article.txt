Alfred Frankenstein, music critic
for the San Francisco Chronicle,
and Leslie J. Schivo, English horn
ist for the San Francisco Symphony

an informal public discussion Wed
nesday evening sponsored by the
recently revived Stanford Sym
phony Forum.
The discussion will be held on the
second floor of the Knoll at 8:30.
Schivo will perform musical inter
pretations and illustrations, accom
panied by his wife on the piano, and
Frankenstein will discuss the life
of a musician in an orchestra and
explain the English and French
horn.
After the lecture the audience
may ask questions. Refreshments
will be served after the meeting.
The Stanford Symphony Forum
has recently been revived by Mort
Yelton and Joe Hart. AKL. "This
first informal discussion of the year
has been held to get students inter
ested in forming an active Forum, or
organization," said Yelton. "It will
need good student support in order
to insure students of more Forum
activities next year in securing tick
ets to the San Francisco Symphony
Thursday Evening Concert Series
tickets and more discussions with
guest artists."
The new Forum hopes to establish
a ticket pool, sponsor more discus
sions on campus with visiting ar
tists, arrange for more seats and
boxes at the Thursday Concert Se
ries, plan car pools for transporta
tion to concerts, set up a record
lending library, and combine with
the music listening room organiza
tion and help improve the listening
room.
The first San Francisco Symphony
Forum was started at Cal in 1938
when eight students bought a Sat
urday night box to the symphony.
The Symphony Musical Association
encouraged the eight students by
selling them their season box seats
at a special student rate.
In 1940, because of the interest,
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra added another weekly con
cert on Thursday evenings for col
lege students at half price.
At present 21 colleges in the Bay
Area belong to the San Francisco
Symphony Forum.
