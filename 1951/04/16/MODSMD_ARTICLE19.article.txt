WASHINGTON, April 15 (UP)
â€”Selective Service Director Maj.
Gen. Lewis B. Hcrshey said today
that drafting of college students
may have to be delayed until some
time after July to give them time
to take the new aptitude tests.
Hcrshey said the delay is likely
because many students who hope
to score high enough on the forth
coming examinations to win de
ferment will not be taking them
until late in June.
