# Stanford Aids in Tackling India's Education Problem
## 
### JOAN SEAVER 
With only 15 per cent of her peo
ple literate, India today is trying to
spread free compulsory education
throughout a population of 350 mil
lion.
It is a job involving decades. With
a million villages, she will need two
million village schools. This means
colleges to train an unprecedented
number of teachers to educate the
masses of free India.
Several years ago, less than half
the students who applied for gradu
ate study in India could be admit
ted, because of the lack of graduate
schools. Only 189 primary schools
enrolled an average of 52 children
each last year.
Tradition prohibits coeducation on
the lower levels. Even the Indian
intellectuals, who know that, liter
acy is not the same thing as educa
tion, look skeptically at Western
type training. On top of all the
obstacles are the 12 major lan
guages of the country.
Seeing this colossal problem fac
ing the Nehru government, Stanford

chose India for financial assistance
and cultural exchange and, specifi
cally, the University of Delhi.
Founded in 1922, Delhi draws stu
dents and professors from all over
the world. Seven associated colleges
lying as far away from the main
campus as Kashmir magnify the
problem of equipping, staffing, and
financing the university.
A $1,500 check from Stanford's
foreign relief drive and the benefit
concert was sent to, the World Stu
dent Service Fund for Delhi. This
and future contributions from Stan
ford will be used in Delhi toward
the university's goal—a close fed
eration of colleges offering high
level academic instruction in the
humanities and sciences.
The Indian Affiliation Committee,
headed by Kay Cohrt, has begun
to make contacts with student
groups and faculty members at Del
hi. Out of the affiliation, the com
mittee hopes for an exchange of
thought, culture, and eventually
students, to the benefit of Stanford
as well as the Indian university.
