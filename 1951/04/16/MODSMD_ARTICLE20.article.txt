# second PANEL
## ASSU Forum Topic Tonight Is Elections 
### 
Campus elections and lack of in
terest in them will be one of the chief
problems discussed at tonight's stu
dent forum at 7:30 in the lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
Speakers from different fields have
been selected to evaluate Stanford's
activity program. The aim of the
forum, sponsored by the ASSU
Forum Committee, is to find out what
student activity needs are, and
whether or not the existing program
meets those needs.
The speakers are Dr. H. Donald
Winbigler, Dean of Students; Gil
Jonas, member of Excom; Jan Ed
wards, former Union Unit president; !
Gordon Addison, head of the Public
Relations Committee; Jo Lyon, ASSU
vice-president, and Bill McColl, All- I
American football player.
After the talks, the meeting will be
open to general discussion. Campus
organizations are asked to bring j
problems and opinions before the
forum at any time.
Topics such as difficulties in plan
ning a university social program, the j
role of public relations, and the at- j
titude of the administration toward j
the social program will be discussed. I
The forum is an outgrowth of one
held winter quarter which evaluated j
the educational program of the Uni- j
versity.
