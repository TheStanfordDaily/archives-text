## Decision: Crisis Not New 
### 
More than 700 students heard
prominent faculty members discuss
their respective fields and answer
questions in the two-day Student
Conference last weekend.
In a nearly unanimous consensus,
the speakers agreed that "The Cri
sis" is not new. Dr. Tully C. Knoles,
chancellor of the College of the Pa
cific, observed one reason that we
are so acutely aware of a world
crisis is that we are reminded of it
so often by radio, newspapers, and
other publicity media.
Hie ability of freedom and de
mocracy to meet and overcome
challenges in the future, as In the
past, was emphasized by l)r.
James Walkins, bead of the Po
litical Science Department.
Students can contribute to world
understanding by personal contact
and study with people abroad, ac
cording to Dr. Harold Fisher, of
Hoover Library He pointed out in
cidents in which American aid is

feared as a cultural and political in
strument of enslavement, because of
basic misunderstandings of Amcri- 1
j can policy and principles.
Dr. Claude Buss, of the History
Department, summed up the points
of the afternoon and offered the fol-
I lowing suggestions to students:
1. Speak what you believe, think
! as deeply as you can on every occa
! sion until the decision is made, then
j follow the final decision of the ina
! jority.
2. War is not final; it can't stop
the spread of an idea.
3. See beyond the present crisis.
Look out for charged words, such
as Communism, liberal, aggressor,
and consider them in the context
;used.
4. Look at world situations from
j the point of view of others.
President Wallace Sterling sug
gested how the conscientious indi-
I vidual can make decisions by gath- ,

cring all pertinent data he can as
semble, appraising difficulties in
volved, bearing in mind the values
that can best be carried forward,
and having no regrets once the de
cision is made.
Dr. Kreps, professor of economics,
stressed that in periods of inflation
wr must pay as we go, and distrib
ute the tax burden more equitably
by lightening the tax load on lower
income groups.
Richard Baich, Counselor for Men,
stressed nationalism, in that stu
dents must support the larger in
terests of the nation in times of cri
sis. He emphasized that students
who arc deferred for academic rea
•'otis still owe a responsibility to the
draft after graduation. He warned
against taking a persecution atti
tude toward the draft, and said that
those who give their best will re
ceive the most from their military
training.
