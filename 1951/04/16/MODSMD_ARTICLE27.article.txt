''There is only one way to break
through the alliance of politics and
organized crime in the country to
day, and that is through informed
public opinion."
This view was expressed by War
ren Olney. 111, former chief counsel
for the Special California Crime
study Commission on Organized
Crime, at the Stanford Law Forum
Friday.
Olney, a professor of criminal
law at the University of California
at Berkeley, spoke on organized
crime and gave the final reports of
the California Commission along
with some comments no the recent
Kefauver investigations.
"By television." the crime export
said, "the public has had the first op
portunity to sense the extent of crime
and corruption in our time." He
pointed out how the nation-wide
syndicates of organized crime and the
resulting corruption has grown from
the nation-wide wire service which
was first established in 1936 for book
makers.
Organized crime today, he said,
is not a result of any sudden war
horn moral collapse. It is rather
big business carried on by profes
sional criminals, and it has grown
in the post-war era as has all big
business.
The three results of organized
crime, violence, great wealth, and
political corruption, were analyzed
by the UC professor. It all narrows
down to one thing, he said. "Money.
Money is the crux of the whole
problem of organized crime."
Olney reported that, although the*
discrepancies between the incomes
and income tax reports of major
criminals arc obvious, "never has a
major figure of the underworld been
convicted of income tax evasion in
the state of California."
