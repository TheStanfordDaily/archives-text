## Koreans Probe Peace, Yanks Advance

TOKYO. Monday, April 15 (UP)
â€”American tanks and infantry cap
tured wrecked Yanggu, eastern an
chor of the Communists' collapsed
Hwachon Reservoir line, Sunday
and infantrymen knifed behind Chi
nese lines as much as 12 miles north
of the 38th parallel on the west
central front.
At the same time South Korean
monitors reported a broadcast from
Communist North Korea urging the
United Nations to make a "peaceful
settlement" of the Korean war.
The Korean offer was full of such
obviously unacceptable proposals as
the condemnation of the U.S. and
the republic of South Korea for
their aggression against North Ko
rea and for bombings of the Korean
Communist territory. The whole
philosophy of the UN in intervening
in Korea was based on the premise
that it was North Korea, and later
China, which committed aggression.
