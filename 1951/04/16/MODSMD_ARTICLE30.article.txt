# A 						College Man's Dilemma
## 
### 
At a time when most of us have trouble dis
tinguishing plain bunk from fancy bunk, we
owe our professors an expression of apprecia
tion.
Dr. Frederic Strothmann, professor of Ger
man, climaxed the Stanford Student Confer
ence last weekend with a reminder to students
of the bombardment leveled at University fac
ulties to "sell" Americanism. Our teachers are
attacked for standing behind the academic pul
pit and teaching the truth in an objective man
ner, when they should be "indoctrinating"
prospective draftees with v/hat we are fighting
for.
Dr. Strothmann reminded us that we just
don't Jive Jong enough to INHERIT American
ideals. We have to ACCEPT them. And be
fore we can be intellectually honest in this
acceptance, we must analyze and examine
our way ot life impassionately.

Many students can look back over their col
lege careers as a path of broken idols. We see
that our high school history books often were
masterpieces of American propaganda; we are
cautioned to read TIME with reservations; and
isn't it too bad that Dad doesn't understand the
Keynesian theory.
So what do we come out with? Who can we
believe?
The students whom you have trained to de
velop a critical and objective attitude turn to
you—our teachers. We are depending on your
integrity and courage to present to us, in full,
the truths that your lives of study have revealed
to you.
It is the faith that you will continue to shoot
straight with us, and not paint the target red,
white, and blue to please the flag-wavers, that
allows us honestly to accept and defend our
nation's principles. —By Joy Haas.
