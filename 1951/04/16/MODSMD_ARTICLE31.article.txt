# CAMPUS OPINION
## Affiliation With India 
### 
To the Editor:
Because this Monday wll be India Day in celebration
of Stanford affiliation with the University of Delhi,
through the lIR, I should like to bring up several ques
tions which come to my mind.
First of all, I think we need clarification on what
affiliation is, because a number of people who work
on the India Day Committee themselves do not know
what it means. Affiliation is the adoption of a uni
versity through the World Student Service Fund
which receives the "adoptor's" money and transmits
it to the "adoptee." In the process of transmitting the
money, the WSSF slices off 50 per cent of the money to
cover its operating expenses and to build up a fund
to take care of disasters.
It is not the purpose of my letter to criticize what
the WSSF does with its 50 per cent. I feel that its op
erating expenses are kept to a minimum and the
money which is spent for their emergency projects is
money well spent.
I should, however, object to the llR's action in
affiliating through the WSSF. Since it is money of
the Stanford student body which the lIR is contrib
uting, I feel that the Stanford student should be
given whatever benefit that may be in affiliation. In
affiliation through the WSSF the Stanford student
has lost direct contact with the University, because
it is the WSSF that transmits the funds. Much of
the work is done by WSSF personnel—work which
I think could be done just as well by Stanford per
sonnel.
I certainly cannot imagine that the lIR is short of

personnel that could work on this project, as they are
always working on some new project and this, surely,
would be a worthwhile one.
Recently we sent a check for $1,500 to WSSF for
transmission to Delhi, yet of the check Delhi will
only get $750. If the University of Delhi needs that
help which we are offering them, I am sure that they
could use the $750 of the money WSSF is pocketing
and we would get the added pleasure of spending
our money for something tangible.
