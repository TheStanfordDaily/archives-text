# Mac Arthur Welcome
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Tomorrow morning, when General Mac Arthur ar
rives in San Francisco. Americans throughout the land
are planning to herald his return in the most spec
tacular demonstration of devotion in history. An ap
peal has been made that all available noise producing
instruments be employed at the instant he steps from
his plane—to cast across the land an everlasting trib
ute to a great soldier and statesman.
It is urgently suggested that our mighty carillon
atop Hoover Tower join by ringing out its welcome
in a tumultuous acclaim to a great leader—past, pres
ent, and future.
