# THE 						DANCING YEARS'
## Musical Is Second Best 
### ROY HEMMING 
A frightfully British musical has opened at the Park
Theater in Menlo. Everything in "The Dancing Years"
is supposed to happen in and around Vienna in the
days preceding the first World War. But the spirit, the
manner, and particularly the accents are unmistak
ably English. Perhaps a little Old English too.
The overall effect of ''The Dancing Years" is a
musical film which London audiences must have
taken great delight ir« calling "charming." The plot,
unlike most Hollywood musicals, refuses to ooze
with happy cliches or an everything-will-work-out
dandy-by-the-finale attitude. In its very British
way it oozes will all sorts of calculated bad luck
which everyone tries to take as nobly as possible.
Understated emotions and self-sacrificing reserve
may be well adapted to certain types of British dramas.
But when they're applied to a lavishly technicolored
musical, they tend to become a little stuffy. At that
point even a lilting Ivor Novello music score can't
rescue everything—at least not for those of us who
have !:een seduced by the "new type" musical.
In all fairness, it should be said that Mr. Novello—
up to his death a few months ago—enjoyed a unique
popularity in London for the very sort of production
The Dancing Years'' represents. His musicals al
ways tried to recapture a romantic spirit similar to that
of the Viennese operettas before 1914.
Yet, while he was seeking something in the past,
American composers like Richard Rodgers and Leon
ard Bernstein have taken us in new directions and in
troduced us to new. more contemporary techniques.
Perhaps it is not so much critical standards as time
that has made Novello come out second-best.
And since "The Dancing Years" pretends to be more
than a transferred stage production, it is subject to
<*ven more cruel comparisons. Say all you want about
the inanities of most Hollywood musical plots and
we could say some that would never get into print
but that does not excuse the static nature of Novello's
film. Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, and several others
have .shown us what can be done with the musical film
—take the musical sequences in the recent "Royal

Wedding," for example, or on a different level the
British "Red Shoes."
The color and music and a ballerina named Pa
tricia Dainton in "The Dancing Years" are all very
pretty. But in the eventful years that have danced
on since the days of Novello's plot, some of us—in
America at least—have come to expect more from
our musical entertainment.
There is really something of a lesson in the film at
the Park this week.



AS PLAIN AS TIIK NOSES ON THEIR FACES—
Disagreement is evident in the expressions of
Daily reviewers George Buckley and Roy Hem
ming pictured here emerging from a local movie
house. The disagreement applies to "The Dancing
Years," which will lie debated by the two critics
