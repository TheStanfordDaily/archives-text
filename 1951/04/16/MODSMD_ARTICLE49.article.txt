split a pair of non-league weekend
shames, edging San Jose State 7 to (i

13 to 10 Saturday.
Tiie win over San Jose gave the
Indians a clean sweep of their
three-game series with the Spar
tans. Stanford's Roger Osenbaugh
and San Jose's southpaw Jim Col

for five innings as Stanford grabbed
a 2 to 1 lead in the first frame, and
the Spartans tied with one run in
the fourth.
In the sixth inning the Cards
broke loose with a five-hit attack
for five runs and a 7 to 2 lead.
Coach Everett Dean sent Joe Chez
to the mound in the seventh inning,
and Chez, still showing the effects
of his recent attack of pneumonia,
could retire only one man, while
the Spartans were pushing across
four runs.
Murphy Puts Out Fire
Bob Murphy, called in from the
bull-pen, then got Dean Giles to hit
into a double play to end the inning
with the Cards still ahead 7 to G,
where the score remained. Art
Abrahamson led the Stanford at
tack with three singles.
A strong aiumni nine Saturday
handed the varsity their eighth de
feat of the season.
The game was a see-saw battle
all the way, with the alumni going
ahead 3 to 2 at the end of the second
inning. The varsity forged ahead 5
to 3 in the third on three unearned
runs off alumni hurler Jack Heinen.
Tony Stellar went in to relieve
Card pitcher Alexander in the fifth
frame, and the alumni greeted him
with four runs to go ahead 7 to 5.
Game Tied Up

count at 7-all in their half of the
fifth on a single by Dick Clegg, a
pair of walks, and an error. The
alumni then scored one run in the
top of the sixth.

runs in the seventh, two in the
eighth, and one in the ninth to go on
