The Stanford frosh track squad
swept to an easy 85 to 46 victory
over the San Jose State freshmen
Saturday despite the fact that they
were without the services of some
of their best performers.
Indian Jim Mclndoe was high
point man with firsts in the javelin
and broad jump and a tie for first
in the pole vault.
