## 
### 
I Thirty-five heads fell Saturday as
j Coach Chuck Taylor reduced the
I &rid squad to 90, and got ready to
! shift the Big Red Machine into sec
ond gear.
Intensive scrimmages were held
! Friday afternoon and Saturday
j morning, with some improvement
| being shown by the team. Taylor,
| however, voiced concern over the
I spotty character of the line play so
far.
It is here, especially on the de
fensive side, that the Indians sus
tained their biggest losses from the
'50 squad, and the effect is unfortu
nately all too obvious.
On the brighter side, Gary Ker
korian did some sensational pass
ing, and may this year better his
phenomenal 1950 completion aver
age of 52.5 per cent. Bill McColl,
j doing some of the catching, looked
in mid-season form.
But almost equally adept in this
j department was a newcomer, Sam
[ Morley, up from the frosh squad.
All in all, the Indians may develop
! one of the most potent aerial games
ever seen in the PCC.
Another pleasant surprise is the
1 speed shown by the team as a
whole.
