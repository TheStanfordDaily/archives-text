# Chronicle Critic Will 'MC' Forum
## 
### 
The first informal musical dis
cussion, sponsored by the re
| cently revived Stanford Sym
phony Forum, will be held to
morrow night with Alfred Frank
enstein, music critic for the San
i Francisco Chronicle, and Leslie
J. Schivo, English hornist for the
San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, as guest speakers.
The discussion will bo held on the
second floor of the Knoll at 8:30.
i "This discussion," said Joe Plart,
president of the Forum, "will give
| students an opportunity to ask ques
tions about the life of a musician in
an orchestra and any other questions
| concerning music."
Schivo will perform musical in
terpretations and illustrations on the
French horn, accompanied by his
wife at the piano. Frankenstein will
act as master of ceremonies. Re
freshments will be served after the
j meeting.
In the future, if enough interest is
shown in this first meeting, Hart said,
. the Forum can extend its function
beyond the usual selling of half-price
( tickets to the San Francisco Sym
phony Thursday Evening Concert
[ Series.
Some of the aspirations of the
Forum are to establish a ticket pool,
sponsor more discussions on campus
; with visiting artists, arrange for more
seats at the Thursday Concert Scries,
plan car pools for transportation to
concerts, set up a record lending li
brary, and combine with the music
listening room organization to help
improve the listening room.
At present 21 colleges in the Bay
Area belong to the San Francisco
Symphony Forum. The nucleus of
â€¢he Forum, composed of representa
tives of the schools, distribute the
Thursday Evening Series concert,
tickets to school Forums and plan and
organize informal discussions at the
member schools.
The Forums at each school, as at
j Stanford, sell the tickets to the stu
dents and exccute the informal dis-
I cussions with visiting musicians.
