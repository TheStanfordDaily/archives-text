# Army May Cut Draft
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April J6 (UP)â€”!
the Defense Department is expected
to cut its May draft call soon be
cause of a continued spurt in enlist- 1
ments and smaller - than - expected
casualties in Korea, it was disclosed
today.
While no firm decision has yet been
made, the Army has almost reached
its authorized strength of 1,500,000
men and induction of the full 80,000 |
men alerted for the May draft call
likely would push it over its quota.
The Navy and Air Force have not
yet used the draft in the current
emergency since they have been able
to meet their requirements with vol
unteers. They may be forced to do
so later under the new system for as- I
suring the Army a fair share of
brighter recruits.
The Army already has cut its April
draft call from 80,000 to 40,000 men,
explaining that any larger inductions
would overstrain its training l'acili- j
ties and perhaps result in shortages j
of some type of equipment.
