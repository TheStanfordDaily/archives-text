HONOLULUâ€”Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur paid tribute to the fallen
of World War II today, not far from
Pearl Harbor where the crash of
Japanese bombs hurled the United
States into the biggest conflict of its
history.
The general, pausing here on his
way hack home to present his case
to the American people, stood at
salute for a full minute at the base
of the flagpole in National Memorial
Cemetery where 13,000 men lie bur
ied. He placed a wreath of orchids
five feet high at the bottom of the
flagpole, then, in a voice that trem
bled slightly, said: "I did not know
the dignity of their birth, but I do
know the glory of their death."
More than 120,000 persons turned
out to see Mac Arthur today. At
3:21 p.m. (5:21 p.m. PST) a motor
cade left the guest house of Adm.
Arthur W. Radford, commander-in
chief of the Pacific, where the gen
eral and his family had spent the
night.
After leaving the cemetery, the
17-car motorcade proceeded to the
University of Hawaii where 3,000
students and Hawaiian citizens were
waiting to see Mac Arthur receive
the degree of Doctor of Civil Law.
It was awarded to him by mail five
years ago, but this was the first op
portunity for him to receive it in
person.
