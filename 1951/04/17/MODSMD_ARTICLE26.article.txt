# Let's Keep the Symphony

Tonight, for the second and last time this
year, one of the nation's top-flight symphony
orchestras comes to Mem Aud.
Pierre Monteux and the San Francisco Sym
phony are practically institutions hereabouts.
For the past three years they have come to the
campus under the auspices of the Committee
on Public Exercises, while previously — for
many a year—they were sponsored by ASSU.
Conductor Monteux has proven his interest
in beaming classical music to college students
of the Bay Area. During the regular symphonic
season, every Thursday night is "college night"
at the War Memorial Opera House in San Fran
cisco. Students can take in a series of 16 con
certs for virtually half-price.

It is a fact that this program cannot be
equalled anywhere in the United States.
In addition to his San Francisco efforts, Mon
teux goes afield periodically to bring musical
programs to Stanford, Cal, Mills, and other Bay
Area schools.
It is a rare privilege for students to be able to
listen to one of the finest symphony orchestras
in the country that has set up shop practically
in their own backyard.
Still, if students and faculty fail to support
such concerts as the one on tap tonight, we
stand under the shadow of losing the sym
phony concert at Stanford, simply because the
orchestra cannot meet its expenses when play
ing to houses only partly filled.
