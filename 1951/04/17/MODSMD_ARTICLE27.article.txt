SIGNS OF SPRING AND THINGS — One of the
first things you notice about Stanford in the spring is
the overcrowded conditions in the Main Libe. There
are never enough seats, book lines are long, and hold
cards are stacked high. It's about as crowded there as
the Mem Aud is for an 8 o'clock Bio midterm that
doesn't count on a Saturday morning after a big night
at L'Ommie's.
Il seems that the real challenge of spring quarter is
who can study the most without anybody knowing
about it. Why there's one guy wandering around Inner
Quad who's doing such a good job that he hasn't even
looked at his Reg Book yet. . . .
The Time Schedule is another serious challenge to
the Farm mind. Most quarters, the standard procedure
is to grab some good courses and avoid all 8 o'clocks.
But now that spring is here, the whole routine
switches.
First rule—no afternoon classes. The Dean's Office
might as well conserve paper and print the Time
Schedule on half sheets, listing only a.m. courses.
Next, you take a gander at the End-Quarter Exam
section. This eliminates all morning classes that have
late finals. In order to be wound up by the third day of
finals, you can only sign up for an 8, a 10, and an 11
o'clock. Now the problem is to get as many credit
units for as few hours in class as possible. There's one
industrious fellow out at the Village who has spent
eight quarters taking the necessary prerequisites to
set himself up for this spring. He's taking 16 units,
and has only nine hours of classes. The only sore spot
in his schedule is "Malayan Culture from 180.'l to 1822
and Its Effect on the Elasticity Demand Curve," a sem
inar which meets on Monday afternoons. It's his only
afternoon class. . . .
So ;far the weather hasn't been the greatest. As a

matter of fact, it's really been poor. If things don't
improve, those strange folk from down Southern Cali
fornia way will not be so ashamed of their smog. For
sure, the Chamber of Commerce for Redwood City is
really going to have a job juggling the weather sta
tistics if it wants to make hometowners and vacationers
believe that old sign that hangs over the city limits.
"Climate best by government test." It ain't so funny
any more. . . .
Just like last quarter it was the vogue to have ski
racks on the car roof, now the fad is to have no roof
at all. Non-convertible owners are moving to the back
roads. . . .
Then there's always I>ake for quiet diversion.
Even when it's crowded, it is the only place on campus
where the ratio is decent—ten frogs for every person.
Besides frogs, there are always the guys (some call
'em toads) that drip water all over everybody and
everyone. Especially disturbing when one of 'em
ruins a perfectly cold little slam in no-trump.
Real sign of spring is how all the portables are being
put in shape and tried out on the tail-end of the grape
fruit Circuit. Baseball redhots can been seen glued to
their Philcos in the Nitery, at the Lake, and all over.
Best listening bet is Liberty's "Game of the Day," at
11 a.m. each day. It's over KYA on the local dial.

GOOD JOB. WELL DONE—Notice how clean the
Cellar's been iately? Whoever dreamed up the idea
of having a spotter shout at unthinking coffee-timers
deserves a big thanks. The place looks much cleaner
now, and besides the PA system playing records in be
tween reprimands is very pleasant. . . . Now some
body should come up with an idea of how to put a
stop to all the messing around with the pay phones.
