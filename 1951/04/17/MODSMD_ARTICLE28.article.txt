## Graduate Student Questions Draft Interpretation 
### 
To the Editor:
The text of President Truman's executive order re
garding the student draft appears in the New York
Times of Sunday. April 1, on page 35, of section I. Ac
cording to this text, the statement made by Mr. Balch
os quoted in The Daily on Wednesday, April 4, seems
misleading.
The order says:
(Deferment will he granted if) "the registrant is a
full-time graduate student seeking a graduate de
gree and the graduate schools at which he is in at
tendance have certified that he is currently meeting
degree requirements and is expected to attain that
degree."
Mr. Balch said he believed that there was no schol
astic deferment for graduate students and that they
would have to score 75 or higher on the aptitude test
to stay in school. According to President Truman's or
der, do such students really have anything to gain by
taking the test?

(Editor's Note.—ln reply to the above letter, Chief
Counselor for Men Kichard L. Batch told The Daily
that the entire text of the executive order was not
taken into consideration by reader Hoffman. Just
above the passage quoted from the order is a state
ment which says a registrant's activity in study
MAY BE considered to be'necessary to the mainte-

nance of the national health, safety, or interest un
der the following conditions:
(1. Acceptance or enrollment in a professional
school of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine,
osteopathy, or optometry, subject to satisfactory
work.
(2. Full-time graduate work toward a graduate
degree, or admission to a graduate school for the
next class, subject to satisfactory work within such
categories as the Director of Selective Service, with
the approval of the President, may prescribe. This
may be attained by a required scholastic standing, or
by a certain score on a qualification test to be given
all students, or both such standing and score.
(Balch stated that there will be a CONSIDERA
TION for scholastic deferment given to graduate
students who are either in the upper half of their un
dergraduate class in their senior year or who score
75 or higher on the aptitude test.
("Graduate students who are in their second year
of graduate work have a great deal to gain in taking
the new test because it will be up to the discretion
of a local board as to whether a student's activity in
study MAY BE necessary to the maintenance of the
national health, safety, or interest.
("The additional evidence of the test result will
aid the local draft board in a decision that might
otherwise have only the evidence of the fact that he
was satisfactorily pursuing a full-tinie program of
study," Balch explained.)

cording to this text, the statement made by Mr. Balch
os quoted in The Daily on Wednesday, April 4, seems
misleading.
The order says:
(Deferment will he granted if) "the registrant is a
full-time graduate student seeking a graduate de
gree and the graduate schools at which he is in at
tendance have certified that he is currently meeting
degree requirements and is expected to attain that
degree."
Mr. Balch said he believed that there was no schol
astic deferment for graduate students and that they
would have to score 75 or higher on the aptitude test
to stay in school. According to President Truman's or
der, do such students really have anything to gain by
taking the test?

(Editor's Note.—ln reply to the above letter, Chief
Counselor for Men Kichard L. Batch told The Daily
that the entire text of the executive order was not
taken into consideration by reader Hoffman. Just
above the passage quoted from the order is a state
ment which says a registrant's activity in study
MAY BE considered to be'necessary to the mainte-

nance of the national health, safety, or interest un
der the following conditions:
(1. Acceptance or enrollment in a professional
school of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine,
osteopathy, or optometry, subject to satisfactory
work.
(2. Full-time graduate work toward a graduate
degree, or admission to a graduate school for the
next class, subject to satisfactory work within such
categories as the Director of Selective Service, with
the approval of the President, may prescribe. This
may be attained by a required scholastic standing, or
by a certain score on a qualification test to be given
all students, or both such standing and score.
(Balch stated that there will be a CONSIDERA
TION for scholastic deferment given to graduate
students who are either in the upper half of their un
dergraduate class in their senior year or who score
75 or higher on the aptitude test.
("Graduate students who are in their second year
of graduate work have a great deal to gain in taking
the new test because it will be up to the discretion
of a local board as to whether a student's activity in
study MAY BE necessary to the maintenance of the
national health, safety, or interest.
("The additional evidence of the test result will
aid the local draft board in a decision that might
otherwise have only the evidence of the fact that he
was satisfactorily pursuing a full-tinie program of
study," Balch explained.)
