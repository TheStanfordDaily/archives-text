# House Invitation
## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”The House un
animously invited Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur today to address Con
gress Thursday and Senate leaders
agreed to follow up his welcome
with a history-making investigation
of President Truman's Asiatic poli
cies.
Mac Arthur, stripped of his com
mand for bucking those policies,
sent word that he is willing to ap
pear as a star witness in the com
ing hearings on where and how the
United States should put its main
emphasis in combatting Communist
aggression. The administration be
lieves the test will come in Europe;
Mac Arthur says Asia.
