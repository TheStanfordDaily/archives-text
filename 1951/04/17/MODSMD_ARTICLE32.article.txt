# KIMPTON'S STUDENT YEARS
## Athlete, Debater, Hasher Now Chicago Chancellor 
### PHIL WILCOX 
The appointment of Lawrence
A. Kimpton to the post of Chan
cellor of the University of Chi
cago brings to mind many
events of his years at Stanford,
both as a student and as Dean of
Students from 1947 to 1950.
Kimpton's first acquaintance with
Stanford came in 1927 when he ar
rived here as a freshman. He had
a brief tryout with the football team,
then under Coach "Pop" Warner,
but decided to switch his talents to
the debate team. He became vice
president of the Stanford chapter of
Delta Sigma Rho, honorary debate
society.
An interesting aspect of his
undergraduate years at Stanford
was a lesson in finances given him
by his father. In Kimpton's fresh
man year, his father, a Kansas
City lawyer, made his checking
account into a joint one with his
son. Young Kimpton wrote Checks
freely and among other expendi
tures bought a car.
When he returned to Kansas City
for summer vacation, his father
questioned the number of the boy's
canceled checks on the account,
which amounted to approximately
$2,300.
Pointing out that inquiry to the
dean had indicated that such an
amount was more than lavish for a
Stanford student, the senior Kimp
ton announced that he would pay
his son's railroad fare to Palo Alto
in the autumn but would pay no
more of his college expenses.
As a sophomore, therefore,
Kimpton earned his way hashing
at the Union, delivering newspa
pers, working in a sports shop,
and selling for the concessionaire
at football games. After he succ
essfully remained solvent during
the entire year, his father agreed
to pay his expenses once more.
Kimpton graduated from Stanford
in 1931 with great distinction after
having been elected to Phi Beta
Kappa in his junior year. During
his undergraduate years he lived at
Encina, Toyon, and Branner.
He returned to Stanford in 1947
after having worked up in an 11-
year period from a teaching posi
tion at Deep Springs School in Cali
fornia's High Sierras, to vice-presi
dent and dean of faculties at the
University of Chicago.
As dean of students and pro
fessor of philosophy here, Kimp
ton was a popular friend of the
student body. He consistently
stood behind the students in sup
port of the fraternities and a

! strong athletic program, serving
in the iatter connection as the
Stanford faculty representative on
the Pacific Coast Conference.
In the monthly column which he
wrote for the Stanford Alumni Re
view, Kimpton gave a humorous
j resume of his job here. He called
! himself "a sort of a catch-all guy in
charge of everything that concerns
J students outside the classroom. The
I job by definition is, of course, im
possible. Nobody can remain sane
| and be in charge of all this," he
I commented.
Kimpton becomes the sixth chan-
I cellor of the University of Chicago,
j replacing Robert M. Hutchins who
! resigned to become a director of the
multi-million dollar Ford Research
Foundation.

CHANCELLOR KIMPTON
—"With great distinction"
The appointment of Lawrence
A. Kimpton to the post of Chan
cellor of the University of Chi
cago brings to mind many
events of his years at Stanford,
both as a student and as Dean of
Students from 1947 to 1950.
Kimpton's first acquaintance with
Stanford came in 1927 when he ar
rived here as a freshman. He had
a brief tryout with the football team,
then under Coach "Pop" Warner,
but decided to switch his talents to
the debate team. He became vice
president of the Stanford chapter of
Delta Sigma Rho, honorary debate
society.
An interesting aspect of his
undergraduate years at Stanford
was a lesson in finances given him
by his father. In Kimpton's fresh
man year, his father, a Kansas
City lawyer, made his checking
account into a joint one with his
son. Young Kimpton wrote Checks
freely and among other expendi
tures bought a car.
When he returned to Kansas City
for summer vacation, his father
questioned the number of the boy's
canceled checks on the account,
which amounted to approximately
$2,300.
Pointing out that inquiry to the
dean had indicated that such an
amount was more than lavish for a
Stanford student, the senior Kimp
ton announced that he would pay
his son's railroad fare to Palo Alto
in the autumn but would pay no
more of his college expenses.
As a sophomore, therefore,
Kimpton earned his way hashing
at the Union, delivering newspa
pers, working in a sports shop,
and selling for the concessionaire
at football games. After he succ
essfully remained solvent during
the entire year, his father agreed
to pay his expenses once more.
Kimpton graduated from Stanford
in 1931 with great distinction after
having been elected to Phi Beta
Kappa in his junior year. During
his undergraduate years he lived at
Encina, Toyon, and Branner.
He returned to Stanford in 1947
after having worked up in an 11-
year period from a teaching posi
tion at Deep Springs School in Cali
fornia's High Sierras, to vice-presi
dent and dean of faculties at the
University of Chicago.
As dean of students and pro
fessor of philosophy here, Kimp
ton was a popular friend of the
student body. He consistently
stood behind the students in sup
port of the fraternities and a

! strong athletic program, serving
in the iatter connection as the
Stanford faculty representative on
the Pacific Coast Conference.
In the monthly column which he
wrote for the Stanford Alumni Re
view, Kimpton gave a humorous
j resume of his job here. He called
! himself "a sort of a catch-all guy in
charge of everything that concerns
J students outside the classroom. The
I job by definition is, of course, im
possible. Nobody can remain sane
| and be in charge of all this," he
I commented.
Kimpton becomes the sixth chan-
I cellor of the University of Chicago,
j replacing Robert M. Hutchins who
! resigned to become a director of the
multi-million dollar Ford Research
Foundation.
