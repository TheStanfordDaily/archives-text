Orchids, daisies, and chrysanthemums to our "Little Orphan Annie
crew for their second-place finish at the Newport Kegatta last weekend.
The great differences in the first-place Cal crew and the Card crew the
Bears' financial support from the university and their large plant and plenty
of equipment; the early practice that Cal had over Christmas vacation row
ing against New Zealand and Australian crews, against the Indians few
pieces of equipment, no support whatosever, and no outside practice
marks the Stanfords as having made and excellent showing, rhis is con
trary to the opinion of Dink Templeton who, after the race, stated in a radio
broadcast his disappointment that the "orphans" didn t run away with the
race alter all their publicity.
For Dink's information, publicity doesn t make a team. If he 11 stop and
consider the above facts, he may get a different picture.
PREDICTS WIN
We're ready to predict right now. however, that before the season is
through the Stanford crew will beat Cal. They have three more chances,
the first being next May 12 at Seattle against Cal and Washington. The
Cards have a good chance of taking Washington, too, as the Huskies,
perennially strong in the shells, have lost four men out of last year's first
lioat.
A little publicized event after the Regatta last Saturday occurred at the i
.â€¢-wanky Balboa Bay Club where the Indian crew was quartered at the ex- 1
pen.se of the Regatta committee. When the Cards arrived there Friday, the
first thing they did was to run their Stanford crew Hag up the yardarm of
the Club flagpole, as is usually the practice.
After the race, while all of the boys were in the shower with the excep
tion of Ken Lewis, No. 3 man in the varsity boat, and Bill Neff, No. 2 in
the jayvee shell, it was discovered that someone was stealing their flag. )
FRIED TO STOP
Immediately Ken and Bill ran outside to prevent the theft, but they were
a little late. One man had already gotten the flag and was running toward
the Club dock. Two others were in a car nearby.
Ken and Bill started after the man with the flag, but as they headed for
the dock, Bill was clipped from behind by one of the men from the car, in
juring his leg as he fell. Ken, not seeing this, continued on.
When he reached the clock, the man with the Mag, a young fellow, jumped
in a small boat tied up at the end of the wharf. As he pulled away from the
dock, Ken arrived and dove in, catching onto the side of the boat with his
hands.
Ken tried to tip the boat over, but the man started hitting his hands with
an oar. Then Lewis tried to grab the fellow and pull him out of the boat,
but he was unable to do it, as the man kept whaling away with his oar.
Finally, the pain in Ken's hand was too much for him, and he had to let go.
The boat continued on and was soon lost in the maze of boats in the channel.
The crew member reported the incident to the Balboa Chamber of Com- ;
merce, and were promised that the flag would be recovered or replaced I
with a new one.
CAN BE SERIOUS
Just goes to show how serious a playful prank can become. Two men
have been seriously injured by the actions of three young fellows who prob
ably only wanted a souvenir.
We've often wondered when something like this is going to happen when
someone tries to paint the "C" red, or light the Big Game bonfire premat
urely.
