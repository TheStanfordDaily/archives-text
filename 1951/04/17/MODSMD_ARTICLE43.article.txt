# Taylor Stresses Line Play
## 
### 
Coach Chuck Taylor put his grid- j
tiers through more intensive scrim- i
mages yesterday afternoon as spring J
practice huffed and puffed its way j
into the second week of drills.
Line play was emphasized, espe- !
cially defense, as the footballers I

ran through their few basic plays.
Looking very good at the middle
linebacker post was Tsar Calfee,
who last season added considerably
to the Indians' strength in the mid
dle of,the line spelling liuss Pom
eroy, Card All-Coast linebacker, oc

j casionally. Calfee will go a long
! way toward patching up the hole
left by Pomeroy.
Another hole, the center position
vacated by Dick Abraham, may be
! well filled by Don T'obin and Doug
Thamer. Both saw little action last
season, Tobin being out most of the
time with injuries, but from their
scrimmage yesterday, they're go
ing to be rough men to get past.
At the end of scrimmage, Taylor
| ran his men through a number of
! windsprints. A great improvement
I was shown over the first day of
J drills. Almost all of the men can
! make it back to the showers at the
I end of the day.


RUGGED CONTENDERS—Here are three hefty linemen, who have done a lot of work during
Coach Chuck Taylor's hard spring practice sessions. Left to right, Norm Manoogian, a regular
starter at guard during the last season; Dan Tobin, a center showing plenty of promise; and Leon
King, another guard who saw plenty of action toward the end of the past grid campaign. Tobin
missed football this year because of injuries, but played plenty of rugby.
