# Indians Try for Second Victory Over USF Dons
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
To use an old sport cliche, today's baseball game between USF
and Stanford will be the rutfber match. Each club has emerged
victoriously once in the two previous meetings, and today's win
ner will be adjudged the better club.
Game time will be 3:15 p.m., and as usual the encounter will be

played here.
After USF comes USC on Friday
and a double-header at Santa Clara !
on Saturday. This is definitely
make - or - break time for the In
dians, causing Coach Everett Dean
to comment, "With our pitching on
the up-grade, the team is looking
forward to our hardest week of
games."
The hard - working coach has
nominated either Bob Murphy or
Jim Claypool to oppose today's vis
itors. Concerning this pair Dean
said, "Bob Murphy has arrived and
looked effective in his relief work
against San Jose Stale, while Jim
Claypool turned in a great game
against Santa Clara." He added that
Roger Osenbaugh's performance in
winning over Cal was highly pleas
ing, and the lanky right-hander will
probably get the starting call in the
USC game. Ace chucker Joe Chez
lost his first game of the year to the
pneumonia bug, but according to
Dean will be ready sOon.
Today's visitors boast one of the
best independent clubs in the state.
They have two good pitchers in Bob
Thollander and Don Townsend, and
with Ed Rommel and Gene Jacobs
they have some chance of offsetting !

some of the batting power supplied
by Crackerjack Shepard, who has
been the team's Atlas so far, carry
ing most of the hitting weight on his
shoulders. According to Coach
Dtan. Jack's fielding is matching his
effective stickwork.
The Stanford starting lineup will
remain the same as that which lias
! been opening in the league games.
