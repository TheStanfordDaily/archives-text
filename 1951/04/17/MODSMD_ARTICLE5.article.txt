# Forum Finds Excom Representation Bad
## 
### 
Inadequate representation on
ASSU Excom was a main point
brought up in relation to forming
the University extra - curricular
program at the ASSU Forum last
night.
Getting information through to
the individual students and educat
ing them in regard to campus issues
were two major problems found in
trying to plan programs according
to the desires of the students.
Having class representation on Ex
j com seems to result in a dead end
I after issues have been brought be
fore class excon.s, said Jan Edwards.
She also found fault with the sys
tem of representation calling for
only one representative for Roble,
Branner, and Lagunita.
Off-Campus Representation
Representation of off-campus stu
dents was pointed out as another
major failing of the present system
by Gi! Jonas.
Jo Lyon brought out the point
that women have the best opportu
nity to be aware of campus issues
through the AWS, but that men
outnumber them and have the con
trolling vote.
The organization of Associated
Men Students was proposed to com
bat this problem.
The fact that students at Stanford
want to be individualistic, and that
programs should be planned on a
small rather than mob scale was
suggested. Ted Hinshaw said he
believed apathy was not the reason
for lack of interest in programs
planned, but the individualism or
sophistication of Stanford students
was the cause. Another reason given
was that there is not enough educa
tion of the students as to campus
issues and programs.
Social Program
Another point brought out in the
discussion was that a social program
must correlate with changing world
conditions. The Student Conference
held last weekend was given as an
example of changing student inter
est in this respect.
The student in the world situation
is the problem of the day, said Gil
Jonas. He believes students at Stan- i
ford are becoming politically naive
and suggested permission to have
on-campus groups representing the ;
major political parties.
