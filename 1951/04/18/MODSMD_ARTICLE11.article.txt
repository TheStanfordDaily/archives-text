# A 						'Hell Week' Suggestion
## 
### 
With spring quarter's round of fraternity in
itiations just around the corner, the old question
of "what to do during hell week" is in for a sure
lire batting around.
Even if fraternities do decide to eliminate off
grounds initiations (thus abiding by the IFB
ruling), chances are there'll be some heavy
sweating within fraternity walls come pre-initi
alion week.
ffere's a suggestion, reprinted from the Se
attle Post-lntelligencer, that we think would go
a long way toward solving some of those "hell
week" thought twisters:
"Hats ott to the Alpha Beta Phi chapter at
the University ot Washington for recent Ini
tiation Week innovation.
"Instead ot being forced to perform sense
less stunts, pledges were reguired to put in
two nights baling 2 1 /2 tons of clothing which
the American Friends Service Committee
wj.s sending to Korea.

"Thus a wholesome and constructive out
let was piovided lor youthful energy which
would otherwise have been expended in a
completely negative if not positively harm
ful manner.
"Fred Fisher, teaching fellow in physics,
who conceived the project, is to be congrat
ulated on the success ot the experiment.
"If other fraternities follow suit, adopting
similarly worthwhile community projects as
a regular feature of their activities, they will
achieve a great deal ot good."
In these times, there would seem to be an
abundance of "similarly worthwhile" projects
lying around just waiting for action.
Furthermore, the Alpha Beta Phi idea pre
sents a golden opportunity for Stanford's fra
ternities to shoulder some of that "responsibil
ity" the administration has been turning over
to themâ€”a darn good chance to help prove
they're worthy of that responsibility.
