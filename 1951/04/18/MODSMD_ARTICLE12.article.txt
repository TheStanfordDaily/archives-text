# The
						Streets of Stanford
## 
### 
Ah, yes, those roads! It's become too com
mon a saying hereabouts that all roads lead to
Rome, except Stanford roads that lead only to
ruin. Admittedly the University does have a
street problem, but let's look into the whys and
wherefores of the chuckholes in campus thor
oughfares.
Consider, for example, the section of Galvez
Street from Encina to Stern and the part of Es
condido in front of Stern. These blocks were
completely re-laid last summer, and already the
traditional holes have begun to appear here and
there. As each hole gets bigger, student gripes
get louder as to why the University doesn't
spend some money and do a decent job.
Actually, the new road was intended to last
permanently. The University spared no ex
pense in acquiring consulting engineers, coun
ty road experts, and road contractors to assay
the particular soil conditions beneath the street.
It then financed the laying of an even deeper
base than was called for. In short, no money
was spared. But still the pavement, in spots,
has failed in little more than six months.

University Business Manager Alf Brandin at
tributes the failure to the peculiar soil condi
tions which exist in certain areas of the cam
pus. He cites one case in which a troublesome
section of street near the Post Office was ex
cavated to a depth of four feet and filled in with
rocks. In due time, the pavement above the
rocks once more began to wrinkle.
The University annually allocates approxi
mately $20,000 for the maintenance of campus
roads and walks, on the theory that the more
money that is spent for the repair of roads, the
less is available for education. When addition
al funds are available, new and more perma
nent roads are constructed, and several endur
ing roads have been laid in the last five years.
Students should realize that the administra
tion is attempting to make the most of its road
budget. Until more money is available, road
repair will have to consist primarily of an an
nual coating of gravel to fill in the smaller holes
and occasional patchwork. In the meantime,
Stanford's Cadillacs, Plymouths, and Fords will
just have to suffer.—B. B.
