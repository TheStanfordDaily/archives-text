# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOE CUSICK 
HE has returned. Tumult and shouting. Our ears
are attuned; we await the Hoover Carillon to burst
faith in peals ol triumphant welcome. The Beacon of
the Orient has returned to his blessed native land after
14 years of dedicated, self-imposed exile.
Why has this General of the Army, this man become
Legend, returned to the United States? Why has this
Supreme Commander of UN Forces in Korea, this Su
preme Commander for the Allied Powers and Occu
pied Japan returned? The answer: He was fired from
his job(s) by a piano-playing ex-Missouri haber
dasher. Ponder that!
Was he fired because he worked with singular
energy toward democratizing Nippon? Or because
lie drove the enemy out of the Republic of Korea—
after a few false starts and "minor" miscalculations?
Or because war correspondents had to "carrier pi
geon" their dispatches to the I!.S. via Japan?
Naw. None of that. Our pokering friend from Inde
pendence fired him "with regret" because he thought
the Great Man was not .supporting the policies of his
Commander in Chief. What colossal gall! Who knows
best how to fight a war, the commander in the field
or the commander at the desk?
Listen; you can hear the chorus of acclaim for him
rc.il eastward, like the swells of the great Pacific, his
pond. Thousands, millions of throats cry the welcome.
'Die torrent rises, spills over the Sierra, the Rockies,
and Hoods the great heartland. (A confused colonel
stands between two streams, not knowing whether to
bathe or swim.) The foaming crest rushes onward,
and engulfs the East, quenching fires here, developing
high-tension electric power there.
The undertow has already developed. A new word
is added to the Contemporary Charged-Word Vo
cabulary—lmpeachment. It is the new shibboleth
held high by the forces of the Crusade to rid this

nation of the "uninspired leadership" of a grinning
commoner who wears aloha shirts on vacation.
Place the counter-indictments on the balance trays.
The General's record is well-known and easily under
stood. Consider the charges against the politicking
pipsqueak:
1. He upheld the Constitution by removing a gen
eral who had assigned to himself the task of policy
making.
2. He opposed this particular policy which would
begip an ail-out Asian war, a trap long laid by the
Kremlin.
3. He initiated the United Nations challenge to the
North Korean Communist aggression.
4. He formulated a doctrine for aid to Greece and
Turkey, and stayed the advance of Soviet imperialism
in that strategic area.
5. He espoused the Marshall Plan and sponsored the
North Atlantic Treaty.
G. He is for a civil rights program, decent wages
and working conditions, decent housing, improved
education, and better health methods and facilities.
Ecce homo. It that not indictment enough?
Awake! Thou sleeping empire-builders! The scroll
of history awaits the pen stroke. Parallel 38 is today's
Rubicon. Think not of first moral principles, of just
means and ends—that is talk for Jesuits. Remove the
Symbol of Mediocrity from his Pennsylvania Avenue
hotseat. Cast off this sham of inefficient democratic
constitutionalism; it cannot protect us from the Red
Storm. (It is a holey cloak; it leaks; it makes us rely
on our personal vigor too much.)
All America cries for an AU-American Leader; a
Fuhrer, a Duce, must bring order out of fragmentation
and chaos. Down with weak-kneed majority rule,
down with civilian government control of this nation.
Ave Caesar—Ave Imperium Americanum—Ave Mac-
Arthur. (And thanks to Tom Stokes.)

Symbol of Mediocrity from his Pennsylvania Avenue
hotseat. Cast off this sham of inefficient democratic
constitutionalism; it cannot protect us from the Red
Storm. (It is a holey cloak; it leaks; it makes us rely
on our personal vigor too much.)
All America cries for an AU-American Leader; a
Fuhrer, a Duce, must bring order out of fragmentation
and chaos. Down with weak-kneed majority rule,
down with civilian government control of this nation.
Ave Caesar—Ave Imperium Americanum—Ave Mac-
Arthur. (And thanks to Tom Stokes.)
HE has returned. Tumult and shouting. Our ears
are attuned; we await the Hoover Carillon to burst
faith in peals ol triumphant welcome. The Beacon of
the Orient has returned to his blessed native land after
14 years of dedicated, self-imposed exile.
Why has this General of the Army, this man become
Legend, returned to the United States? Why has this
Supreme Commander of UN Forces in Korea, this Su
preme Commander for the Allied Powers and Occu
pied Japan returned? The answer: He was fired from
his job(s) by a piano-playing ex-Missouri haber
dasher. Ponder that!
Was he fired because he worked with singular
energy toward democratizing Nippon? Or because
lie drove the enemy out of the Republic of Korea—
after a few false starts and "minor" miscalculations?
Or because war correspondents had to "carrier pi
geon" their dispatches to the I!.S. via Japan?
Naw. None of that. Our pokering friend from Inde
pendence fired him "with regret" because he thought
the Great Man was not .supporting the policies of his
Commander in Chief. What colossal gall! Who knows
best how to fight a war, the commander in the field
or the commander at the desk?
Listen; you can hear the chorus of acclaim for him
rc.il eastward, like the swells of the great Pacific, his
pond. Thousands, millions of throats cry the welcome.
'Die torrent rises, spills over the Sierra, the Rockies,
and Hoods the great heartland. (A confused colonel
stands between two streams, not knowing whether to
bathe or swim.) The foaming crest rushes onward,
and engulfs the East, quenching fires here, developing
high-tension electric power there.
The undertow has already developed. A new word
is added to the Contemporary Charged-Word Vo
cabulary—lmpeachment. It is the new shibboleth
held high by the forces of the Crusade to rid this

nation of the "uninspired leadership" of a grinning
commoner who wears aloha shirts on vacation.
Place the counter-indictments on the balance trays.
The General's record is well-known and easily under
stood. Consider the charges against the politicking
pipsqueak:
1. He upheld the Constitution by removing a gen
eral who had assigned to himself the task of policy
making.
2. He opposed this particular policy which would
begip an ail-out Asian war, a trap long laid by the
Kremlin.
3. He initiated the United Nations challenge to the
North Korean Communist aggression.
4. He formulated a doctrine for aid to Greece and
Turkey, and stayed the advance of Soviet imperialism
in that strategic area.
5. He espoused the Marshall Plan and sponsored the
North Atlantic Treaty.
G. He is for a civil rights program, decent wages
and working conditions, decent housing, improved
education, and better health methods and facilities.
Ecce homo. It that not indictment enough?
Awake! Thou sleeping empire-builders! The scroll
of history awaits the pen stroke. Parallel 38 is today's
Rubicon. Think not of first moral principles, of just
means and ends—that is talk for Jesuits. Remove the
Symbol of Mediocrity from his Pennsylvania Avenue
hotseat. Cast off this sham of inefficient democratic
constitutionalism; it cannot protect us from the Red
Storm. (It is a holey cloak; it leaks; it makes us rely
