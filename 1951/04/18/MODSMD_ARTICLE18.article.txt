# KZSU to Host Campus At Open House Tonight
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
KZSU is offering students an opportunity to see what makes a
radio station tick tonight when the 109-member student staff holds
an open house from 7 to 10.
The station is inviting students to inspect the offices in the cellar
of the Memorial Auditorium, and then to watch tonight's broad-

casting from the studio upstairs. Re
freshments will be served.
The station will have spot broad
casts of election returns tonight and
Station Manager Herb Seiter prom
ises plenty of action.
Now in its fifth year of operation,
the campus radio station has ex
panded since its first broadcast in
January of 1947.
First Broadcast
The first broadcast went to Roble,
Encina, Branner, Toyon, and Lagu
nita. Since then, the station's range
has been enlarged to include other
campus houses and the Village.
The late president Donald Tresid
der sponsored the founding of KZSU.
The station's purpose was to serve as
a laboratory for the training of stu
dents.
Originally KSU, the station added
the "Z" two years ago to comply with
an FCC ruling requiring all stations
to have four letter names.
Famous programs include Stanford
Sadie and the Tail of the Golden Bear
series, where Stanford students, pos
ing under the banner of the Blue and
Gold, interviewed University of Cali
fornia students.
The station hasn't completed four
years of broadcasting without a few
miscues.
Early Mishaps
Early programs were transcrip
tions of major network shows, and a
transcription for a show was mis
placed one day.
Just as a student was announcing
the cancellation of the program, an
engineer raced in with the missing
transcription.
The flustered announcer came out
with "Due to circumstances beyond
our control, the program now sched
uled will be broadcast."
Tonight's schedule:
7:oo—Music at Seven
7::lo—Bagatelle Basket
B:oo—Card Classics
