# FOUND: A POLE VAULTER
## Meyers Out for Bamboo Leap; 6 Key Men Will Miss Oxy Meet 
### 
Bob Meyers, Stanford's start
ing fullback last fall, came to the
rescue of the Indians' depleted
pole vault corps when he turned
out for the event at Angell Field
yesterday.
Smiles could he .soon on coach Jack
Weiershauser's lace as the former
fullback easily cleared the bar at 12
It.(i in. on three different tries.
Meyers had previously vaulted in
high school and junior college, but
had never turned out for college var
sity competition.
Meanwhile, the rest of the Card
varsity was prepping for their l)ig
tilt with tough Occidental College,
whom they will meet in Los An
geles on Friday night.
The Indian sick and injury lists
are still long. Menitt Van Sant, ace
broad jumper, felt his strained
muscle pulling in the triangular
meet last Saturday, and the team
physician ordered a week's rest.
Two-iniler John Kaufman and
disc us thrower lan Ueed will miss
the Oxy meet because of heavy
colds. Kecd, who was just begin
ning to hit his stride, has, in addi
tion, a tonsil infection.
Low hurdler Bob Bryan, who has
been out for two successive Satur
days, is still on the inactive list with
\i pulled le>-; muscle and will not be
ready for Friday night's meet.
Joss Seroggy, half miler and relay
man, will also be missing from the In
dian traveling squad because he is
recovering from an ear infection.
Bob Mathias, Stanford's all
around track man, may have a try
at the iavclin this weekend, since
Oxy is very weak in this event. The
Indians' regular javelin thrower
Dick llcnigan cannot he counted on
because of a sore elbow.
i'ill Storum, who normally runs the |
high hurdles ancl relay, may take a I
crack at the low barriers. Storum
had plenty of the necessary speed in
a practice luw hurdle run at Angell
Field yesterday.
