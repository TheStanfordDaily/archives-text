Baseball players are funny people.
The various likes and dislikes of baseball players have no more
similarity than the intermittent bounces of a batted ground ball.
For instance, they claim sportswriters often have the wrong slant
but make a bee line for a nev/spaper after having a good day.

During the exhibition season, they
claim the games are a burden, but
jump at a barnstorming chance fol
lowing the season. When quoted they
say there is no substitute for expe
rience, but yet in the team roster they
try to shave a year or two off their
age.
In a ball player's mind, he is never
fat, just hefty. Although insisting
they are in the pink of condition,
they still spend hours on the rub
bing table. All say that the best play
er is the hungry one, but they all eat
like condemned men.
As far as positions go, third base
men think the outfielders have the
life, but the gardners are quick to
reply: "They shouldn't talk." Often
the catcher is praised as the brains
of the team, but his equipment i.s re
ferred to as the tools of ignorance.
Pitchers are the ones. The same
hurlers who complain of hcing
overworked cry in protest when
not allowed to pitch every four
days. They pooh-pooh sentiment,
but the winning pitcher generally
wants posession of the last ball in
play. If a hall is scuffed, a pitcher
will ask for a new one; then if a
pitch gets away from him. he'll
complain the hall was too smooth.
Any ballplayer will tell you that a
walk is as good as a hit, or three
timely singles are better than a home
run, but then they all try and belt
the ball out of the park every time.
They guard their favorite jeal
ously, but then risk breakage by
throwing them disgustedly into the
air after striking out.
Many stay awake at night hoping
for rain to wipe out a game the next
day, and then moan at the double
header that results. On such rainy
days they love to .sit around hotel
lobbies for hours but squawk when
they have to warm the bench.
Autograph hounds bother them,
until they stop coming around.
They claim they'd rather he lucky
than good and then deride a hall
club that gets the lucky breaks.
Every Major Leaguer dreams of
playing in a World Series, and then
moans when his friends ask for tick
ets.
Now with the 1951 campaign just
under way, all ball players are bless
ing their return to action, but toward
September those blessings will turn
to prayers for the season to come to
a rapid close.
Well, anyway, it all goes to prove
that ballplayers are human, too.
