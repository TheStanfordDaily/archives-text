able to hold his own against any
team in the CIBA, thus giving
Coach Everett Dean another top
notch starting pitcher to work with.
Thollander Beats Self
Thollander, who topped the Tribe
6 to 1 lust time the two teams met.
pitched excellent ball, scattering
seven Card hits and staying ahead
of the batters most of the afternoon.
But he was the victim of his own
error in the sixth inning as he gave
the Indians their winning run with
a wide throw to the plate.
Bruce Cameron led off the sixth
with a beautiful drag bunt down the
third base line and beat it out for
an infield single. Art Abrahamson
followed with a sacrifice bunt;
however, Don first baseman Frank
Ratto, who fielded the bunt, fired to
second. Cameron beat the throw to
the bag, and Abrahiamson was on at
first.
