# 45th Anniversary Today Of Earthquake Disaster
## 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
Forty-five years ago today, April 18, 1906, the greatest disaster
in West Coast history struck Stanford. It was the day of the earth
quake.
Two lives were lost, seven were injured, and over 52,800,000
worth of damage was inflicted on campus buildings.

The tremor began a few minutes
after 5 a.m. and lasted 20 seconds.
In that 20 seconds Memorial Arch
fell, Memorial Church was practi
cally demolished and its tower
crashed to the ground, the steel
frame and the dome were all that
remained of the new library, the
new gymnasium was ruined, and
not a campus building escaped
without some damage.
Students slept outdoors on the
night of the 18th, but aside from a
few slight tremors, the great shake
of 1906 was over.
By the following day the damage
was found to be so great that Presi
dent David Starr Jordan suspended
classes for the remainder of the
quarter.
It was soon discovered that a
miracle, too, had hit Stanford.

Dozens of students had miracti
| louslv escaped death. The floors
of Rnhlc fell through and (he
chimney crashed through the roof
and lav straight across the center
of the hall, hut no one was hurt.
Seven were dug from the debris
in Encina but only one life was lost
there.
Not a chimney stood intact after
the quake and outer quad was com
pletely wrecked in spots, hardly
touchcd in others. The University
was a shambles.
Stanford, operating on a tijjht
budget, was in danger of becoming
defunct, but Dr. Jordan had the
answer.
"We have often said that it is
not buildings but men that make
the University," the president
said. "Now is the time for Stan
ford men to show that this is
true."
The t University set out to restore
the quad classrooms so that school
could be opened again in August.
One hundred thousand dollars was
set aside for this.
Stanford was not harassed by fire,
like the one that devastated San
Francisco, but the Stanford family
had much more than that to be
thankful for. Had the earthquake
come a scant few hours later and
caught students in classrooms, the
story would have been much more
tragic.


TWENTY SECONDS OF DISASTER â€” The Memorial Arch
looked like this after the 20-second earthquake of 1906. Total
damage to the campus was estimated at $2,800,000.
