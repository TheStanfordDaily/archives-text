# General MacArthur Returns, Says, 'Thank You For Not Forgetting Us'
## 
### 
Five thousand persons jammed the Pan American International
Airport last night to welcome General Douglas MacArthur.
The general was home after a 14-year absence that spanned two
wars.
The general's personal plane, a four-engined Lockheed Constel-

lation named "Bataan," rolled to a
stop at 8:29 p.m.
An 800-million candlepowcr are
light promptly spotlighted the huge
silver ship and illuminated the brown
letters "Bataan" on a green fiield of
the plane's nose.
The general's pilot, Col. Anthony
Story, was first to appear in the door
of the plane. He was dismayed by
the large number of photographers
and reporters waiting for the general
to alight.
The general's wife Jean was the
first to leave the plane. Dressed in
an air hostess skirt and a combat
jacket with an orchid corsage
pinned to the front, she smiled and
waved her way down the ramp.
The general followed closely be
hind his wife and was recognizable
by his gold-braided cap hut was
wearing an olive-drab raincoat in
stead of his usual khakis and combat,
jacket.
MacArthur told the crowd, "Thank
you for not forgetting us."
He walked between lines of pho
tographers and reporters to the
front of the administration build
ing. One photographer on the ad
building roof called. "Hey, general,
look up here." MacArthur looked
up. smiled and waved, and the pho
tographer had a classic.
MacArtnur went to the review
ing stand, which was in the middle
of a blocked-off space about the size
of two football fields, and twice
toured the 200-man honor guard.
Each time he passed between the
guard and the crowd, he was
cheered.
Pausing before a young soldier,
the general slapped him on the
back and asked, "Have you ever
been in Korea?"
"Yes sir!" was the answer.
Proceeding to the reviewing stand,
MacArthur's jaw muscles bulged in
an effort to control his voice as he
spoke to the crowd.
"I can't tell you how good it is
to be home. Mrs. MacArthur and
I have talked and talked and
talked . . . about coming home.
. . . This marvelous reception
. . . given by the city of San
Francisco . . . has made coming
home seem even more worth
while."
MacArthur stood at stiff attention
and saluted when the first salvo of
a 17-gun salute was fired. A thou
sand waving flags bearing the words
"Hi Mac — Wclcomc Back" were
joined by a "MacArthur for Presi
dent." sign as the general moved to
ward the shiny black closed sedan
that was to take him to the city.
Turning to LI. (Jen. Albert C.
Wcdcmeycr, commander of the
Sixth Armv, MacArthur said,
"Tell them (the people of San
Francisco) thanks very much."
Wedemeyer, with Governor Earl
Warren and Mayor Elmer Robinson,
formed part of the reception com
mittee.
Before entering the car, Mrs. Mac-
Arthur was presented with a bou
quet of roses by a seven-year-old
girl who accompanied a represen
tative of the Korean consul in San
F ranisco.
The general, his wife, and his 13-

year-old son, Arthur, who has never
been in the United States, got into
the car.
People lined the road from the
airport to the highway and cheered
the waving, smiling MacArthur as
an escort of 30 motorcycle police
led his car from the airport at about
9 o'clock. The band played "Cali
fornia, Here I Come."
The crowd was orderly and co-op
erative, and everyone obeyed orders.
There was no repetition of Monday's
Honolulu incident where photogra
phers were roughed up.
The scene outside the Saint Francis
was like a circus. The crowd flowed
across Powell St. and filled Union
Square. Vendors sold peanuts, pop
corn, and hot dogs.
At 10:40 the general arrived at the
hotel. He had switched to an open
car outside the city. The 16-mile trip
had taken close to two hours.
Throngs filled the highways and
streets all the way between the air
port and the city. In town, the gen
eral's car had stopped at every street
corner.
Shouting and applause ripped the
cool spring air as General Mac-
Arthur was ushered into the hotel
amidst the bomburst of (lash bulbs
and a mass of reaching hands.
Minutes later he was striding down
the sixth floor corridor heading for
the presidential suite.
Mrs. MacArthur and her son, es
corted by an aide, reached the hotel
at 10:45. While walking down the
hall to her suite, she turned around
as flash bulbs popped and asked,
"Have you got it, boys?"
Telephone books from the St.
Francis were torn to shreds and
used as confetti. Torn paper and
confetti streamed from the win
dows onto the throngs gathered
before the hotel.

Before entering the car, Mrs. Mac-
Arthur was presented with a bou
quet of roses by a seven-year-old
girl who accompanied a represen
tative of the Korean consul in San
F ranisco.
The general, his wife, and his 13-

year-old son, Arthur, who has never
been in the United States, got into
the car.
People lined the road from the
airport to the highway and cheered
the waving, smiling MacArthur as
an escort of 30 motorcycle police
led his car from the airport at about
9 o'clock. The band played "Cali
fornia, Here I Come."
The crowd was orderly and co-op
erative, and everyone obeyed orders.
There was no repetition of Monday's
Honolulu incident where photogra
phers were roughed up.
The scene outside the Saint Francis
was like a circus. The crowd flowed
across Powell St. and filled Union
Square. Vendors sold peanuts, pop
corn, and hot dogs.
At 10:40 the general arrived at the
hotel. He had switched to an open
car outside the city. The 16-mile trip
had taken close to two hours.
Throngs filled the highways and
streets all the way between the air
port and the city. In town, the gen
eral's car had stopped at every street
corner.
Shouting and applause ripped the
cool spring air as General Mac-
Arthur was ushered into the hotel
amidst the bomburst of (lash bulbs
and a mass of reaching hands.
Minutes later he was striding down
the sixth floor corridor heading for
the presidential suite.
Mrs. MacArthur and her son, es
corted by an aide, reached the hotel
at 10:45. While walking down the
hall to her suite, she turned around
as flash bulbs popped and asked,
"Have you got it, boys?"
Telephone books from the St.
Francis were torn to shreds and
used as confetti. Torn paper and
confetti streamed from the win
dows onto the throngs gathered
before the hotel.

Five thousand persons jammed the Pan American International
Airport last night to welcome General Douglas MacArthur.
The general was home after a 14-year absence that spanned two
wars.
The general's personal plane, a four-engined Lockheed Constel-

lation named "Bataan," rolled to a
stop at 8:29 p.m.
An 800-million candlepowcr are
light promptly spotlighted the huge
silver ship and illuminated the brown
letters "Bataan" on a green fiield of
the plane's nose.
The general's pilot, Col. Anthony
Story, was first to appear in the door
of the plane. He was dismayed by
the large number of photographers
and reporters waiting for the general
to alight.
The general's wife Jean was the
first to leave the plane. Dressed in
an air hostess skirt and a combat
jacket with an orchid corsage
pinned to the front, she smiled and
waved her way down the ramp.
The general followed closely be
hind his wife and was recognizable
by his gold-braided cap hut was
wearing an olive-drab raincoat in
stead of his usual khakis and combat,
jacket.
MacArthur told the crowd, "Thank
you for not forgetting us."
He walked between lines of pho
tographers and reporters to the
front of the administration build
ing. One photographer on the ad
building roof called. "Hey, general,
look up here." MacArthur looked
up. smiled and waved, and the pho
tographer had a classic.
MacArtnur went to the review
ing stand, which was in the middle
of a blocked-off space about the size
of two football fields, and twice
toured the 200-man honor guard.
Each time he passed between the
guard and the crowd, he was
cheered.
Pausing before a young soldier,
the general slapped him on the
back and asked, "Have you ever
been in Korea?"
"Yes sir!" was the answer.
Proceeding to the reviewing stand,
MacArthur's jaw muscles bulged in
an effort to control his voice as he
spoke to the crowd.
"I can't tell you how good it is
to be home. Mrs. MacArthur and
I have talked and talked and
talked . . . about coming home.
. . . This marvelous reception
. . . given by the city of San
Francisco . . . has made coming
home seem even more worth
while."
MacArthur stood at stiff attention
and saluted when the first salvo of
a 17-gun salute was fired. A thou
sand waving flags bearing the words
"Hi Mac — Wclcomc Back" were
joined by a "MacArthur for Presi
dent." sign as the general moved to
ward the shiny black closed sedan
that was to take him to the city.
Turning to LI. (Jen. Albert C.
Wcdcmeycr, commander of the
Sixth Armv, MacArthur said,
"Tell them (the people of San
Francisco) thanks very much."
Wedemeyer, with Governor Earl
Warren and Mayor Elmer Robinson,
formed part of the reception com

silver ship and illuminated the brown
letters "Bataan" on a green fiield of
the plane's nose.
The general's pilot, Col. Anthony
Story, was first to appear in the door
of the plane. He was dismayed by
the large number of photographers
and reporters waiting for the general
to alight.
The general's wife Jean was the
first to leave the plane. Dressed in
an air hostess skirt and a combat
jacket with an orchid corsage
pinned to the front, she smiled and
waved her way down the ramp.
The general followed closely be
hind his wife and was recognizable
by his gold-braided cap hut was
wearing an olive-drab raincoat in
stead of his usual khakis and combat,
jacket.
MacArthur told the crowd, "Thank
you for not forgetting us."
He walked between lines of pho
tographers and reporters to the
front of the administration build
ing. One photographer on the ad
building roof called. "Hey, general,
look up here." MacArthur looked
up. smiled and waved, and the pho
tographer had a classic.
MacArtnur went to the review
ing stand, which was in the middle
of a blocked-off space about the size
of two football fields, and twice
toured the 200-man honor guard.
Each time he passed between the
guard and the crowd, he was
cheered.
Pausing before a young soldier,
the general slapped him on the
back and asked, "Have you ever
been in Korea?"
"Yes sir!" was the answer.
Proceeding to the reviewing stand,
MacArthur's jaw muscles bulged in
an effort to control his voice as he
spoke to the crowd.
"I can't tell you how good it is
to be home. Mrs. MacArthur and
I have talked and talked and
talked . . . about coming home.
. . . This marvelous reception
. . . given by the city of San
Francisco . . . has made coming
home seem even more worth
while."
MacArthur stood at stiff attention
and saluted when the first salvo of
a 17-gun salute was fired. A thou
sand waving flags bearing the words
"Hi Mac — Wclcomc Back" were
joined by a "MacArthur for Presi
dent." sign as the general moved to
ward the shiny black closed sedan
that was to take him to the city.
Turning to LI. (Jen. Albert C.
Wcdcmeycr, commander of the
Sixth Armv, MacArthur said,
"Tell them (the people of San
Francisco) thanks very much."
Wedemeyer, with Governor Earl
Warren and Mayor Elmer Robinson,
formed part of the reception com
mittee.
Before entering the car, Mrs. Mac-
Arthur was presented with a bou
quet of roses by a seven-year-old
girl who accompanied a represen
tative of the Korean consul in San
F ranisco.
The general, his wife, and his 13-

year-old son, Arthur, who has never
been in the United States, got into
the car.
People lined the road from the
airport to the highway and cheered
the waving, smiling MacArthur as
an escort of 30 motorcycle police
led his car from the airport at about
9 o'clock. The band played "Cali
fornia, Here I Come."
The crowd was orderly and co-op
erative, and everyone obeyed orders.
There was no repetition of Monday's
Honolulu incident where photogra
phers were roughed up.
The scene outside the Saint Francis
was like a circus. The crowd flowed
across Powell St. and filled Union
Square. Vendors sold peanuts, pop
corn, and hot dogs.
At 10:40 the general arrived at the
hotel. He had switched to an open
car outside the city. The 16-mile trip
had taken close to two hours.
Throngs filled the highways and
streets all the way between the air
port and the city. In town, the gen
eral's car had stopped at every street
corner.
Shouting and applause ripped the
cool spring air as General Mac-
Arthur was ushered into the hotel
amidst the bomburst of (lash bulbs
and a mass of reaching hands.
Minutes later he was striding down
the sixth floor corridor heading for
the presidential suite.
Mrs. MacArthur and her son, es
corted by an aide, reached the hotel
at 10:45. While walking down the
hall to her suite, she turned around
as flash bulbs popped and asked,
"Have you got it, boys?"
Telephone books from the St.
Francis were torn to shreds and
used as confetti. Torn paper and
confetti streamed from the win
dows onto the throngs gathered
before the hotel.

Five thousand persons jammed the Pan American International
Airport last night to welcome General Douglas MacArthur.
The general was home after a 14-year absence that spanned two
wars.
The general's personal plane, a four-engined Lockheed Constel-
