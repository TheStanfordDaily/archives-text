# S.F. Symphony 'In Fine Form'
## 
### ROY HEMMING 
Pierre Monteux and the San Fr.vi ■
cisco Symphony wore in unusually
fine form last nigh*, in their Memorial
Auditorium concert—oven the horns.
There were some rough edges hoi ■
and there, but for (ho most part thr.
orchestra played admirably, keeping
with the spirit and taste clearly evi
dent in Moriteux's direction.
Mr. Monteux may not be the
world's best conductor, nor the S.F
Symphony the best orchestra in the
U.S. But both of them, working to
gether, seem to do more with th"
music they perform than the more
highly publicized or highly endowed
groups.
Last night's program gave u.\ a
good part of the reason why. First
the setting: a campus auditorium, in
keeping with Monteux's admirable
interest in making good music avail
able to students. Secondly the na
ture of the program, which brought
to the audience a brand new Amer -
ican symphony and a rarely per
formed work from the older rrpei
tory to balance the more conven
tional works.
The new item was Paul Crc.v ton's
second symphony, which Monteux
premiered last month. On s> cond
hearing it impressed even better
Brahms' second symphony and
Strauss' "Rosenkavalier" suite
were both played with such care,
verve, and taste that they seemed
refreshing despite their familiarity,
