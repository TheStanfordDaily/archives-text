Showers -ind Hcndix machines *\
slanford Village wrnl without use
yesterday as residents observed
'Bathlcss Wednesday."
The short water supply was
caused by a shutdown in order to
repair a faulty valve in East Palo
Alto of the Hcteh Hetchy water
system which supplies the Village.
Fortunately for residents, the Vil
lage, as the former Dibble Army
Hospital, was built with an auxiliary
attachment into the California Wa
ter Scrvier System's Hear Gulch
runoff system it) Menlo Park.

"litis attachment was utilized be
ginning at p.m. Tuesday, and the
main supply will be turned back on
at 10 this morning. During the
emergency period yesterday, there
was no noticeable change in the wa
ter supply, and no hardships were
suffered by Villagers other than the
foregoing of the daily bath or
shower.
Hard hit by the water shutofT
were homes in East Palo Alto which
were completely deprived of water
during the shutdown period. The

j it.nl 'if Palo Alio was only partially
nlTecletl since city reserves were
j drawn upon lo maintain normal
j service.
The closing down of the system
was caused by a faulty crossover
valve at the Spring Valley pumping
station near Dumbarton Bridge.
The repair of the valve was ex
pected to be simple, but the time
consuming job was the draining of
thousands of gallons of water from
! the main Hetch Hctchy lines to the
I Bay Area.
