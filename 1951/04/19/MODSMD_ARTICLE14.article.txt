# Olympic Day Once Was Irish Marathon
## 
### 
The present Olympic Day is an
outgrowth of what used to be called
the Irish Marathon, featuring a six
mile relay race between 24 - man
teams representing each class.
The relay gradually expanded to
include novelty races, bicycle races,
and other stunts. But in 1933 the
celebration wheezed to a natural
death and was not, revived until
194.') when it was renamed Olympic
Day and held in conjunction with
Sadie Hawkins Day. The 1945 re
vival had a two - year stand and
collapsed following the 1946 pro
duction.
Don Lucas' 1951 edition of Olym
pic Day is an outgrowth of 1950's
succesful revival of an old tradition
that bids fair to stick around.
