"Back to the Farm Week" celebra
tions have changed little since the
first one in 1040.
For that first celebration, horse
less carriages were advised to
keep to the back alleys; contests,
speeches, and races were held; and
25 vigilantes roamed the ranges
around Quad to jail anyone in the
garb of a city slicker.
"Back to the Farm Week" then
and now meant a return to the
1890's. Levis and old clothes were
required dress, Palm Drive was
closed to autos, the hello tradition

was revived, and exchange dinners
I were sponsored.
"Back to the Farm Week" in 1940,
| then, as now, introduced a new
football coach to the student body,
t Clark Shaughnessy, who was to
l take a pushed-around football team
j and engineer it into the Rose Bowl,
addressed an estimated 2,000 stu
i dents and among other things asked
j them if they wanted "to win some
j football games."
Yesterday, ten years later, found
j Stanford's "Back to the Farm" days
j introducing a new coach to the stu-
I dents. Maybe it's a good omen for
I Chuck Taylor.
