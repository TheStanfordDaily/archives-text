# Modern Music Has Changed
## 
### 
"Modern music isn't modern any
more," said Alfred Frankenstein,
music critic for the San Francisco
Chronicle, at the informal discussion
at the Knoll last night where he and
Leslie J. Schivo, English hornist for
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, were guest speakers.
The discussion, first one of the
year, was sponsored by the newly
revived Stanford Symphony Forum.
"No longer are composers writ
ing music with difficult rhythms and
harmonies as they did 30 years ago,"
Frankenstein stated. "Composers
arc writing more for the public."
The sharp hostility that existed
j between the music scholar and the
| composer's musical creativeness in
the 18th and 19th centuries has dis—
| appeared. The scholar was conserv
ative and tried to hold back the mu
i sician.
Today the picture is different,
j Examples of this change are shown
I in the fact that music is now being
j commissioned for concerts, the large
I number of annual music festivals,
j and the growth of interest in the
! colleges as at Stanford.
"Another development that has
, changed modern music is the fact
that the composer has become a so-
I cial being; he is no longer in an
ivory tower," said Frankenstein.
Schivo played three movements
i from "Suit" in Olden Style" by
Kronke on the oboe and "Chant du
! Soir" by Schmitt.
