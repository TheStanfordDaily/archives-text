# BULL SESSION
## 
### CHUCK GETCHELL 
Mr. Arbuthnot, the cliche expert, is on the Farm
this week. We hope that Mr. Frank Sullivan won't
mind if we call his affable friend to the witness stand
to testify for us on one of the season's major sports:
campus electioneering.
Q. If you don't mind my asking, sir. where did you
g«-l that mean-looking welt over the eye?
A. I was struck by a hat that was being tossed into
the ring. Of course, if it weren't the season for
straws, I wouldn't have picked up such a shiner.
Fall elections are a lot less hazardous for the on
looker.
0. I see. Who was doing the tossing?
A. A candidate —also known as a nominee, aspirant,
or would-be office holder.
Q. Why the hat-tossing?
A. Thiit means a candidate has entered the fray. Mis
John Henry is on the ballot. He's running, giving it a
try, or a fiing.
Q. What is the candidate's first move?
A. He seeks support.
Q. How is this done?
A. Hy making speeches. The nominee sounds-off,
he takes a few minutes.
Q. Of what?
A. Of your time. He just likes to say or point out.
that he is the man (or woman).
Q. For what?
A. For the job, of course.
0. And if your vote is already promised?
A. He makes a hid for second or third-place votes.
They count!
Q. What is a candidate's first big hurdle?
A. The primary. If he's been off the dime, he coasts
or,glides through the primary.
(J. Without what?
A. Without strain or visible pain. He's got the deal
made. He's a shoo-in. On the other h;.nd, he may
barely sneak through.
Q. Then what?
A. I'll give you a clue. It's time to get on the stick,
to hustle, to show a little lire or pepper. His friends
have to really start talking it.

Q. In what direction?
A. Up.
Q. Tell ns a little about election day, Mr. Arbuth
not.
A. O.K. Polls open early. Voters Hock, or some
times. trickle to them. Students exercise at the Post
Office or the History Corner.
Q. Exercise what?
A. Their prerogative as voters.
Q. How?
A. By casting their ballots and recording the public
will.
Q. What happens after 3:30?
A. Polls close. Election Board is swamped. The
Nitery suddenly turns.
Q. Into?
A. A beehive. It's a madhouse, a bedlam, a Babel.
Q. What do Board members do?
A. They work feverishly hut efficiently through—
Q. Thick and thin?
A. —no, through dinner hour. They tally, com
pile, check, and re-check election returns.
Q. What do the results reveal?
A. Landslides, upsets, and close contests. Some
candidates make a clean sweep and walk in. They
sew it up early in the count. Others edge or squeeze
by their foes or adversaries.
Q. By how much?
A. By narrow margins, handfuls of votes. They luck
out.
Q. What happens to their opponents?
A. They get nosed out.
Q. What kind of losers are they?
A. Good losers. They commend the winner on the
quality of his going.
Q. What is this quality?
A. Niceness.
Q. Then what call does everybody answer?
A. Milk call. Winner and loser alike join in a night
cap. They wet the whistle. They quaff a few brews
at L'Omelette.
Q. WHERE?
A. Pardon me. At the Egg.
