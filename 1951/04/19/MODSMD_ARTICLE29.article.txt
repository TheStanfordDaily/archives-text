## Why the Affiliation With WSSF 
### 
To the Editor:
With regard to Tom Grose's letter of April lGlh con
cerning affiliation with the University oi New Delhi,
we leel that some clarification is necessary. Affiliation
doesn t mean "adoption" of the University of New
Delhi in the sense that Stanford doles out relief to that
university.
Rather it implies an association which is designed
to promote greater understanding between our re
spective countries through the students of (>ot!i uni
versities. All groups within these two universities
which have any basis lor exchange or common work
would be brought into contact with each ether.
Since Delhi has a refugee problem requiring mate
rial aid, Stanford is trying to help alleviate the prob
lem. However, the affiliation includes not only mate
rial aid, but also establishes a relatioi flip mutually
l.eneficial lo both schools. In order to carry out this
aim, proposed plans include the exchange of cultural
information Ly the major department:; and student or
ganizations in such fields as the arts, humanities, and
science by the use of printed materials and audio
visual aids.
Aftra very careful study, th lIR found (hut aflilia
tion through the WSSF (World Student Service
I'uiul) rather than being less personal, would be
more direct and personal.
1 he WSSF staff officer - in India is in ;i position to
help us establish direct contacts and will sec that thÂ»*
money is used to the best advantage. I'e is on the spot
to observe where the need is the greatest in co-opera
tion with a Delhi committee.
In this way, WSSF help is invaluable .-is Stanford is
not in a position to have a personal representative
acting in its behalf. Any contribution from Stanford
: ttalents will be presented as such; the WSSF agent
will Simply assist us to carry out the program. WSSF
operates on an administrative cost of 4.2 per cent of
the total budget, one of the lowest of any relief organ
ization. It is recognized by UNESCO and CARE as
their official agent in college level relief work.
Stanford has always had a broad foreign relief
program, and although lIR felt there would he great

value in affiliating witli a particular university, we
didn't feel that Stanford's foreign relief program
should he entirely devoted to one university since
student relief needs all over the world are tremen
dous.
For this reason, when sending the cheek through
WSSF, it was stipulated that only 50 per cent be ear -
marked for use at Delhi. The other 50 per cent will
be used at Stanford's discretion to aid in student emer
gencies.
