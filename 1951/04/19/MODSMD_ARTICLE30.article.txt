To the Editor:
O Harry, keep all your cronies in Washington, D.C.,
Overlook the crooks, the five percenters, (he cor
ruption in RFC,
Hut if against your policies an honest man should dis
agree,
Kick him out posthaste and hope the public will not
see
That if is not intelligence you want but onyl con
formity.
