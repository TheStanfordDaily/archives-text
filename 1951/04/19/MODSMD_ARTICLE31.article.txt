To the Editor:
Congratulations to Joe Cusick for a marvelous Bull
Session. His sarcasm may have added some heat, of
which there is too much in the "Citizen" Truman ver
sus "Emperor" Mac Arthur controversy, but he cer
tainly contributed light to the discussion. He assuredly
demonstrated the lack of logic in the nation's present
emotional binge" by his cursory analy.sis of the Presi
dent's (for those who seem to have forgotten—his
name is Truman) actions.
