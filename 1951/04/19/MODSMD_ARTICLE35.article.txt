# Nanney to Play 19th-Century Organ Music
## 
### 
Organist Herbert B. Nanney will
present a program of 19th-century
organ music at the organ recital in
Memorial Church at 4:15 p.m. today.
The program will include the First
Concerto in G Minor by Handel;
"The Musical Clocks" by Haydn;
and "My Heart Is Filled with Long
ing" and the Fugue in E Flat Major
by Bach.
Haydn's "Musical Clocks" selec
tion includes the Minuet ("Song of
the Quail"), the March, the Andan
tino, the Minuet Allegretto, the
Minuet Presto, the Vivace, and the
Fugue.
These pieces were written in 1792
for a famous clock in Vienna. They
were played automatically on a
small flute organ operated by the
Hute mechanism. The group Nanney
will play was arranged by E. Power
Biggs.
