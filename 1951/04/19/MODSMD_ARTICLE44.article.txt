## ‘Up Front' Not Mauldin-- But Funny Just the Same

Two GI characters named Willie
and Joe are presently on view at
the Varsity Theater in a movie
called "Up Front." But the names
and title are almost as far as the
similarities go with the prize-win
ning cartoons by Bil Mauldin.
That is not to say that the mov
ie is not enjoyable or entertaining.
Tom Kwi'll and David Wayne are
fun to watch as they flounder
from one snafu situation to anoth
er. But there was something more
to Mauldin's original subject mat
ter, and the movie misses it.
During World War 11, Mauldin
was a satirist. He did not merely
poke fun at the Army in Italy, its
system of officers, the chow, etc. The
tone of Mauldin's cartoons was that
of a fighting man more than a little

angry at what he saw. "Up Front"
as a movie misses the satire and in
stead pokes fun.
Mauldin's humor is not of quickly
passing value. He strikes deep—as
his Italian cartoons did—at some
basic human qualities. Like Charles
Addams, he draws his theme from
the brutality, the callousness, the

indifference in men. But, different
from Addams, Mauldin tries to show
the effect of these, rather than the
qualities themselves. His focal point
is the victim rather than the per
petrator.
I speak so seriously because I be
lieve Mauldin's is essentially a se
rious theme, offered to us in a dead
ly serious time in one of the most
pointed of ways—through satire.
Mauldin's vignettes of Italy
were often bitter testimonies to
a military situation many til's
thought unfair or found hard to
accept as really necessary. A
prime example, which lie vividly
depicted, was the treatment ac
corded combat til's on rest leave
in Naples. The movie makes only
a joke of this episode.
In other words, there is something
to say—something which should be
said and which Mauldin originally
DID say—about life in the Army.
Faced as we now seem to be with a
long-term military situation in the
world, Americans need to better un
derstand such aspects of the mili
tary set-up.
The movie "Up Front" had the
basis for this vital lesson as well as
for good entertainment. But unfor
tunately, only the entertainment
comes through.

Two GI characters named Willie
and Joe are presently on view at
the Varsity Theater in a movie
called "Up Front." But the names
and title are almost as far as the
similarities go with the prize-win
ning cartoons by Bil Mauldin.
That is not to say that the mov
ie is not enjoyable or entertaining.
Tom Kwi'll and David Wayne are
fun to watch as they flounder
from one snafu situation to anoth
er. But there was something more
to Mauldin's original subject mat
ter, and the movie misses it.
During World War 11, Mauldin
was a satirist. He did not merely
poke fun at the Army in Italy, its
system of officers, the chow, etc. The
tone of Mauldin's cartoons was that
of a fighting man more than a little

angry at what he saw. "Up Front"
as a movie misses the satire and in
stead pokes fun.
Mauldin's humor is not of quickly
passing value. He strikes deep—as
his Italian cartoons did—at some
basic human qualities. Like Charles
Addams, he draws his theme from
the brutality, the callousness, the

indifference in men. But, different
from Addams, Mauldin tries to show
the effect of these, rather than the
qualities themselves. His focal point
is the victim rather than the per
petrator.
I speak so seriously because I be
lieve Mauldin's is essentially a se
rious theme, offered to us in a dead
ly serious time in one of the most
pointed of ways—through satire.
Mauldin's vignettes of Italy
were often bitter testimonies to
a military situation many til's
thought unfair or found hard to
accept as really necessary. A
prime example, which lie vividly
depicted, was the treatment ac
corded combat til's on rest leave
in Naples. The movie makes only
a joke of this episode.
In other words, there is something
to say—something which should be
said and which Mauldin originally
DID say—about life in the Army.
Faced as we now seem to be with a
long-term military situation in the
world, Americans need to better un
derstand such aspects of the mili
tary set-up.
The movie "Up Front" had the
basis for this vital lesson as well as
for good entertainment. But unfor
tunately, only the entertainment
comes through.
