# Taylor Shifts Backs To Plug Weaknesses in Line
## 
### BOB SPIELMANN 
No discoveries of latent All- i
Americans or backs with hidden ;
breakaway talent, but a slow steady |
improvement. That's how Coach j
Chuck Taylor describes the progress
of the '51 Cards so far.
But Taylor may have a fullback
up his sleeve somewhere, or at least
is satisfied with what he has. For j
three fullback candidates, one of •
them a letterman, have been shifted i
to line positions.
The three are Bob Griffin, who
on last year's varsity had a four
yard average per plunge; Don Day,
up from last year's frosh squad; and
John Ludeke. Griffin and Day have
been shifted to guard, and Ludeke 1
to tackle.
Taylor Pleased
The bolstering of the line seems
to have paid dividends already,
since Taylor was much better
pleased with the line work than he
had been. Special emphasis was
placed on pass protection, tackling, i
and recovering a loose ball.
The squad has now been divided :
into offensive and defensive teams,
and chances are that the players ,
will remain divided as they are.
Biggest problem is the selection
of a good pass-defending defensive j
backfield, and Coach George Lynn |
has a dozen men chasing after the
(lying ball for some 15 minutes each
day.
Hugasian Leads the Way
The halfback positions may well !
turn out to be a headache for Tay
lor. Not because there's any lack of
men for the positions, but because i
there's probably enough material to
fill at least three first strings.
The brigade is led by Harry Hu- j
gasian, with Bob Bryan, Eric South- j
wood, Wes Laubscher, Bill Heilbron, !
Bob Hoegh, and Bill McKay, all
from last year's squad, right behind.
But either one or both of the
slots could go to such newcomers as j
Hon Cook or Frank Tenerello, up 1
from the freshman squad, or Leroy j
Fairman, a transfer from Compton. j
Greatest improvement so far has |
been shown in the ball handling de- j
partment, where the pigkins are
staying put in the arms of the backs
instead of bouncing around.
