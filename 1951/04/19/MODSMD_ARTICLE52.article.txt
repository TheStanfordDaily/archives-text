Short blasts from the spring football firing line:
For a man with four monogrammed fullbacks and a host of frosh hope-
I fuls, Chuck Taylor apparently is finding the position a surprisingly heady
problem right now. We note with interest that the fullback ranks have been j
i depleted by the transfer of three of the ex-plungers to slower-moving line
i duties.
Letterman Bob Griffin and John Ludeke are now guards, while Don Day
is getting his exercise as a tackle.
That leaves Skip Crist and Bob Meyers to battle it out for the fullback !
post. Crist, a home-grown Palo Alto product, rates a slight nod at this time,
Meyers having transferred his springtime affiliations to Jack Weiershauser's |
vaulting pit.
But neither Cri:-*t nor Meyers has previously proven any great shakes
j as a tee-dee breakaway threat. So the fullback plum could lie ripe for
picking by some young man of size and ability who also counts outstand
| ing speed among his attributes. A shoe, it could be added, that might
well fit the Tulare Terror, Boh Mathias. . . .
Two facts have been evident in the drills to date: the universal popu- j
larity of the young staff, and the efficient organization they've introduced to
| spring training. In regard to the latter. Taylor confides that the mapping of [
J each day's workout schedule consumes nearly four hours of each working !
I day. . . .
The coaches are stll looking sharply for a running mate for Bill McColl, j
I and fancy-catching freshman Sam Morley has looked as good as any in the ;
! wingmen's drills. Re the end positions. Taylor points out that the worth of!
I an end who can block as well as snag aerials cannot be overemphasized. !
I "The success of at least 75 per cent of the running plays depends upon the j
ability of an end to block," according to the Card tutor. . . .
({note of the week is attributed to student manager Marsh Meyer who,
noticing the Stanford polo team working out on the grass held adjacent
to the gridders' lair, remarked: "Well, anyway, this year they can't say
that Stanford doesn't have the horses." . . .
Taylor rates the four major spring objectives this way: (1) organization j
| of the over-large squad so as to enable the staff to judge each player, (2)
experimentation with players' positions to determine the best spot for each,
(3) familiarizing the squad with the basic patterns to be used next fall, and j
(4) dividing the men into offensive and defensive teams. . . .
Didja know department: Don Liebendorfer, who is currently in his 27th
year at the post, was the nation's first athletic publicity director. Lieben
dorfer, who held the position on a part-time basis before taking over in
earnest upon his graduation in 1925, arrived on the Stanford scene almost !
coincidentally with Ernie Nevers, Stanford's first Rose Bowl team, and the 1
invasion of big-time football by Pacific Coast teams.

invasion of big-time football by Pacific Coast teams.
Short blasts from the spring football firing line:
For a man with four monogrammed fullbacks and a host of frosh hope-
I fuls, Chuck Taylor apparently is finding the position a surprisingly heady
problem right now. We note with interest that the fullback ranks have been j
i depleted by the transfer of three of the ex-plungers to slower-moving line
i duties.
Letterman Bob Griffin and John Ludeke are now guards, while Don Day
is getting his exercise as a tackle.
That leaves Skip Crist and Bob Meyers to battle it out for the fullback !
post. Crist, a home-grown Palo Alto product, rates a slight nod at this time,
Meyers having transferred his springtime affiliations to Jack Weiershauser's |
vaulting pit.
But neither Cri:-*t nor Meyers has previously proven any great shakes
j as a tee-dee breakaway threat. So the fullback plum could lie ripe for
picking by some young man of size and ability who also counts outstand
| ing speed among his attributes. A shoe, it could be added, that might
well fit the Tulare Terror, Boh Mathias. . . .
Two facts have been evident in the drills to date: the universal popu- j
larity of the young staff, and the efficient organization they've introduced to
| spring training. In regard to the latter. Taylor confides that the mapping of [
J each day's workout schedule consumes nearly four hours of each working !
I day. . . .
The coaches are stll looking sharply for a running mate for Bill McColl, j
I and fancy-catching freshman Sam Morley has looked as good as any in the ;
! wingmen's drills. Re the end positions. Taylor points out that the worth of!
I an end who can block as well as snag aerials cannot be overemphasized. !
I "The success of at least 75 per cent of the running plays depends upon the j
ability of an end to block," according to the Card tutor. . . .
({note of the week is attributed to student manager Marsh Meyer who,
noticing the Stanford polo team working out on the grass held adjacent
to the gridders' lair, remarked: "Well, anyway, this year they can't say
that Stanford doesn't have the horses." . . .
Taylor rates the four major spring objectives this way: (1) organization j
| of the over-large squad so as to enable the staff to judge each player, (2)
experimentation with players' positions to determine the best spot for each,
(3) familiarizing the squad with the basic patterns to be used next fall, and j
(4) dividing the men into offensive and defensive teams. . . .

year at the post, was the nation's first athletic publicity director. Lieben
dorfer, who held the position on a part-time basis before taking over in
earnest upon his graduation in 1925, arrived on the Stanford scene almost !
coincidentally with Ernie Nevers, Stanford's first Rose Bowl team, and the 1
invasion of big-time football by Pacific Coast teams.
