## Indians Will Meet Bruins 
### 
Stanford swimming fans will have
a chance to see the Indians' fourth
| in-the-country paddlers free this
I Saturday morning, when they host
the UCLA Bruins in a conference
| meet in the Encina Pools.
UCLA has two top-notch swim
! mers, Monte Nitzkowski and Jack
Spargo, and after them, nothing.
Nitzkoski and Stanford's Bob Fro
j jen will hook vip in what promises
to be the best breaststroke race of
the dual meet season.
In the NCAA meet, Frojen posted
| his best time of 2:22.8 for the 200-
yard event, and in the past two
i meets he has done 2:22.9 and 2:30.0.
Nitzkowski, on the other hand,
j was just two-tenths of a second too
' slow to qualify in the NCAA 200.
His time there was '2:23.8, and last
week against the Trojans from USC
he did 2:26 in a 33'/i-yard pool.
Any swimmer can go from two to
four seconds faster in a regulation
j 25-yard pool than in the odd-length
i tank at UCLA.
Spargo, a distance freestyler, will
| swim against Pete Cole in the 220
and 440, renewing a rivalry which
j stems from high school days. There
is a good chance that Bobby
Thompson will also swim the 220,
; trying for another PCC record.
I Thompson set the record last week
of 2:10.2, and he has been going
hotter than a firecracker all week in
practice.
