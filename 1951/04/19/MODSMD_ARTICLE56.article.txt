## 
### 
Meeting in the featured contest
yesterday, the Phi Kappa Sigmas
outnit, outfielded, and outpitched a
somewhat bewildered nine from
ATO to the tune of 10-3.
It was Derek Bok on the hill for
the Phi Kap club and he posted his
second intramural triumph. Big
gun at bat for the Kappa boys was
Ed Askey. whose home run and sin
gles led the scoring onslaught.
The ball game progressed some
what like this. The Phi Kaps tallied
I one run in the first frame by corri-
I billing a walk, fielder's choice, and
I an error. In the second stanza,
which incidentally produced seven
[ of the ten markers, the Phi Kap
! boys unleashed seven hits including
a triple and a home run.
In the bottom of the third t'le
! ATO nine cashed in with on. un
earned run to ruin Bok's bid for hL-
I second successive shutout. He de
feated the Sigma Chi's last wt-k
! 2-0. Rallying in the top hall' of the
I same inning the Phi Kaps chalked
I up two more runs on two singles
and numerous errors.
Scoring came to an abrupt halt in
the fourth and final frame with ATO
I making a valiant but short - lived
j stand. They were able, however, to
j muster two more runs on two walks,
I a siiv'lc, and an error.
