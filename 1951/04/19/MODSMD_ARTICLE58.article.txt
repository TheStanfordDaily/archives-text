## Lopat Wins For Yankees 
### 
NEW YORK. April 18 (UP)—Th •
New York Yankees, probably tak
ing note of the fact that it was tl t:
17Gth anniversary of Paul Reveri's
ride through New England, took tlu
Boston Ped Sox for one today when
Lefty Ed Lopat yielded just two hit.:
in a G to 1 triumph.
The Yankees, who in recent ye;,is
have caused as much trouble as the
old British Redcoats did in their
time, thus chalked up their second
straight imposing victory over the
Red Sox and this one just mis ;-d
being a no-hitter.
Not only did Lopat yield no safe
blows until Ted Williams singled
with one out in the seventh, but he
also blasted a two-run homer to
wind up the Yankee scoring in tin
eighth. The Yankees touched oft
their scoring in the fifth against Ped
Sox starter Harry Taylor with four
runs. Lopat figured in that rally,
too. getting one of four singles in
the inning.
Rookie Mickie Mantle, still as re
doubtable as they have built him up
to be, delivered two tallies with one
of the singles, Gene Woodling jin
gled home another, and Johnny
Mize accounted for the fourth with
a tall Hy.
