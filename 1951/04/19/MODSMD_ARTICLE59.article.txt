# Conditions in Spain Described
## Foreign Scholar from Madrid Tells of Resistance to Franco 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
Seventeen students anxiously waited for a verdict that would
acquit them of their "treasonable" action of painting propaganda
posters against the government.
But the jury returned with a 3-to-8-year sentence.
The student syndicate, to which all Spanish students must be-

long, had decided to use this ease as
an example.
This was one of many stories that
Francisco Benet. ASSU foreign
scholar from Madrid, told in de
scribing the suppression and at
tempted resistance of Spanish stu
dents in the Franco - controlled
Spain of today.
These students, classmates of
Francisco, were members of the
FUE (Federation of University Stu
dents), an organization which has
been the focal point of student re
sistance to present and past dicta
torships.
Francisco, a former student, at the
University of Madrid, told how the
FUE was founded in 1927 in oppo
sition to Primo de Rivera, and how
this student group was partly re
sponsible for the dictator's down
fall.
When Franco came into power,
the FUE again went into action.
During the civil war they fought on
the side of the republic, but with
most of the students in the army,
the organization disappeared tem
porarily.
To stop the abuses of Franco's
government, which now included
the exile of professors who taught
liberal, modern, or scientific doc
trines, and the presence of police on
the campus, the FUE came into be
ing aeain in 1944, joining forces with
the anti-Franco resistance.
The FUE was outlawed by the
government, and students who did
not land in jail for their clandestine
activities emigrated to European
and South American countries.
Francisco described the present
Spanish educational system as a
complete suppression of freedom of
expression. Under the dual control
of the church and state, there is an
effective moral and political censor
ship.
Professors cannot teach unless
they are members of a civil order
created by the church — the Opus
Dei.
Students must belong to syndi
cates, just as members of the work
ing class must join labor syndicates.
Francisco pointed out that it is
not only the political suppression or
brutality of the police that is the
paramount concern of the people to
day, but the need for a minimum
standard of living.
After years of civil war and op
pression, the people of Spain are
exhausted. "They do not want an
other civil war in spite of their
desire to do away with the dictato
rial controls," Francisco said.
Economic conditions are so bad
that workers in the mills of Barce
lona can only work three days a
week due to a shortage of light and
heat.
In addition the black market,
which was born from the corruption
of the government, absorbs half the
salary of an average worker. The
black market has such a monopoly

on goods, which could be sold at
normal prices, that the worker has
no choice.
Francisco feels that people in the
United States are misinformed
about conditions in Spain, both po
| litical and economic. Americans
i tend to think that the Communist
J influence in Spain is very strong.
But Francisco pointed out that
unlike France and Italy, the Social
| ist and Republican parties present a
| strong opposition to the Commu
nists—it is to these parties that the
i workers look for opposition to
I Franco.
As for the future of Spain, Fran
| cisco said that if the United States
| docs not make the mistake of sup
porting Franco, perhaps the Spanish
people will realize their ideal of a
free nation.
The Spanish people want to take
their place alongside the free na
tions of the world and be recognized
!as one of them. Francisco added
this was an economic necessity be
sides a fervent hope.

Francisco, were members of the
FUE (Federation of University Stu
dents), an organization which has
been the focal point of student re
sistance to present and past dicta
torships.
Francisco, a former student, at the
University of Madrid, told how the
FUE was founded in 1927 in oppo
sition to Primo de Rivera, and how
this student group was partly re
sponsible for the dictator's down
fall.
When Franco came into power,
the FUE again went into action.
During the civil war they fought on
the side of the republic, but with
most of the students in the army,
the organization disappeared tem
porarily.
To stop the abuses of Franco's
government, which now included
the exile of professors who taught
liberal, modern, or scientific doc
trines, and the presence of police on
the campus, the FUE came into be
ing aeain in 1944, joining forces with
the anti-Franco resistance.
The FUE was outlawed by the
government, and students who did
not land in jail for their clandestine
activities emigrated to European
and South American countries.
Francisco described the present
Spanish educational system as a
complete suppression of freedom of
expression. Under the dual control
of the church and state, there is an
effective moral and political censor
ship.
Professors cannot teach unless
they are members of a civil order
created by the church — the Opus
Dei.
Students must belong to syndi
cates, just as members of the work
ing class must join labor syndicates.
Francisco pointed out that it is
not only the political suppression or
brutality of the police that is the
paramount concern of the people to
day, but the need for a minimum
standard of living.
After years of civil war and op
pression, the people of Spain are
exhausted. "They do not want an
other civil war in spite of their
desire to do away with the dictato
rial controls," Francisco said.
Economic conditions are so bad
that workers in the mills of Barce
lona can only work three days a
week due to a shortage of light and
heat.
In addition the black market,
which was born from the corruption
of the government, absorbs half the
salary of an average worker. The
black market has such a monopoly

on goods, which could be sold at
normal prices, that the worker has
no choice.
Francisco feels that people in the
United States are misinformed
about conditions in Spain, both po
| litical and economic. Americans
i tend to think that the Communist
J influence in Spain is very strong.
But Francisco pointed out that
unlike France and Italy, the Social
| ist and Republican parties present a
| strong opposition to the Commu
nists—it is to these parties that the
i workers look for opposition to
I Franco.
As for the future of Spain, Fran
| cisco said that if the United States
| docs not make the mistake of sup
porting Franco, perhaps the Spanish
people will realize their ideal of a
free nation.
The Spanish people want to take
their place alongside the free na
tions of the world and be recognized
!as one of them. Francisco added
this was an economic necessity be
sides a fervent hope.

the organization disappeared tem
porarily.
To stop the abuses of Franco's
government, which now included
the exile of professors who taught
liberal, modern, or scientific doc
trines, and the presence of police on
the campus, the FUE came into be
ing aeain in 1944, joining forces with
the anti-Franco resistance.
The FUE was outlawed by the
government, and students who did
not land in jail for their clandestine
activities emigrated to European
and South American countries.
Francisco described the present
Spanish educational system as a
complete suppression of freedom of
expression. Under the dual control
of the church and state, there is an
effective moral and political censor
ship.
Professors cannot teach unless
they are members of a civil order
created by the church — the Opus
Dei.
Students must belong to syndi
cates, just as members of the work
ing class must join labor syndicates.
Francisco pointed out that it is
not only the political suppression or
brutality of the police that is the
paramount concern of the people to
day, but the need for a minimum
standard of living.
After years of civil war and op
pression, the people of Spain are
exhausted. "They do not want an
other civil war in spite of their
desire to do away with the dictato
rial controls," Francisco said.
Economic conditions are so bad
that workers in the mills of Barce
lona can only work three days a
week due to a shortage of light and
heat.
In addition the black market,
which was born from the corruption
of the government, absorbs half the
salary of an average worker. The
black market has such a monopoly

on goods, which could be sold at
normal prices, that the worker has
no choice.
Francisco feels that people in the
United States are misinformed
about conditions in Spain, both po
| litical and economic. Americans
i tend to think that the Communist
J influence in Spain is very strong.
But Francisco pointed out that
unlike France and Italy, the Social
| ist and Republican parties present a
| strong opposition to the Commu
nists—it is to these parties that the
i workers look for opposition to
I Franco.
As for the future of Spain, Fran
| cisco said that if the United States
| docs not make the mistake of sup
porting Franco, perhaps the Spanish
people will realize their ideal of a
free nation.
The Spanish people want to take
their place alongside the free na
tions of the world and be recognized
!as one of them. Francisco added
this was an economic necessity be
sides a fervent hope.
