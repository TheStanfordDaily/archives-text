operating budget in which every
ASSU-sponsored organization is al

I cases.
Among other things, Elliott's pro

will pass on the itemized budgets of
| each organization.
In no case will a group be allo

ized budget of any group be less
| than the sum originally allo
! | cated, then Excom may reduce that
I group's total appropriation.
