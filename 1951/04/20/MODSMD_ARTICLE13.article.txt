# Cellar Littering Is Still Problem
## 
### 
Ted Buttner, ASSU president, told
j Excom Wednesday night that the
| Union Board of Governors is pres
ently looking into further means of
! eliminating the littering of the area
i in front of the Cellar.
For the past few weeks, a public
i address system has been used to re
mind students to place their refuse
in the trash can.s, and Buttner says
the situation has improved. The sys
! tcm will be continued in the future.
Posters and an additional trash can
j may be added.
In regard to another campus habit,
tinkering with pay telephones, Ex
com is planning to install signs in
each phone booth reminding students
that such tinkering is a violation of
, the Fundamental Standard.
