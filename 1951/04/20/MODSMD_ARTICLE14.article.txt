# Excom Slaves Over Budget
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
Excom members were still i
bargaining and bickering in an
attempt to balance next year's
ASSU budget of $28,325 as the <
Daily went to press at midnight '
last night. From all signs, it ap- 0
peared the student representa- a
tives has resigned themselves to
a 1 or 2 o'clock session in the
semi-smoke-filled Excom Room. ,
Within an hour after their 7 o'clock j
start, Excom had approved the in- (
come side of Student Manager Dave
Elliott's proposed budget. The 1951- p
52 budget is $5,875 less than the cur- ji
rent one of $34,200. „ j t
Consequently, after settling the in- '
come, the Executive Committee be- | r
gan the long task of cutting next t n
year's expenditures by that $5,875. v
First tackling the job on a tentative « 1
basis, the members undertook straw ' 1
votes on each expense item in El
liott's budget. j-
Additional expenses next year had s
to be accounted for in the form of ;
$1,300 to the ASSU office, which was 1
slated for $7,000 next year, and $475 t
to the newly-formed Public Relations
Committee. 112
Reductions occurred in the case of j *
' Men's Glee Club, which this year re- j v
I ceived $180 and requested no support
next year, in the elimination of $50 r
expense account for the student man- if
ager, and with a reduction from $500 1
to $400 for Election Board. These ad- *
ditions and reductions had been ten- h
I tatively approved by Excom in the
: pre-midnight discussion.
In arriving at. his figures, Elliott (
had plannd on an enrollment of 5,900
' in autumn quarter; 5,700 in winter; 1
5,500 in spring; and 2,500 next sum- 1
j mer. These registrations estimates, i
! representing a decline of about 1,400
| students in each quarter except sum
| mer. were based on the most recent
draft edict from Washington involv
ing the aptitude tests.
The ASSU receives $1.25 from cach |
; student each quarter except summer, ;
! when it gets $1.40. Counting the in- j
j come from the Dividex, the Informer,
j Sunday Evening Movies, and rooter !
| cap sales as constant, Elliott reached
I the total of $28,325 income.
In most cases, Excom accepted j
Elliott's proposals after some dis- i
eussion, but the tired, coffee-drink- {
| ing members did hit a few posers.
Phil Nielsen, Foreign Scholarship j
Committee chairman, spent a good |
j part, of an hour telling Excom mem
bers why his committee needed $500 j
more than Elliott had them slated
| for. He finally settled for the budg
eted $4,500.
With the comment that Excom is
| "stifling Stanford as a intercolle- j
giate debate competitor, Harvey j
! Wagner, Debate Society manager, j
! asked and was denied his 1951-52

budget of $1,700. Excom voted the
society $1,300.
Although the representatives will
have been forced to go over the en
tire budget once more in the wee
hours of the morning to give their j
final approval, Excom will have ap
proved the budeet. The final budget
will appear in Monday's Daily.
Excom will discuss the budget j
once more later in the quarter when
they will have approved the item
ized budget of each organization.
Only in emergency cases will the
sums fixed last night be increased.
By press time last night, Excom
had tentatively approved the follow
ing allocations (this year's allowance j
to each organization appears at the l
right);
