### PETE GROTHE 
The funniest television program of the year, beyond
the shadow of a doubt, was General Mac Arthur's his
toric return to the mainland.
I almost missed the show, too. I waited for hours at
the seashore, before someone told me that Mac-Arthur
wasn't going to wade ashore.

With a cry of "I shall return" on
my lips, I rushed for my smog
with knobs on it, better known as
a TV set, and sat in on the whole
miserable, hilarious proceedings.
Actually, Dugout Doug played
it straight. He carried himself
with dignity and composure. It
was the screaming, goggle-eyed
cast of characters around him that
made the show so funny.
Mac Arthur was clue to arrive at

H p.m., and the TV show started at 7. It was going to
Lc interesting to see how the various announcers were
going to fill in the 60 minutes. And it was interesting.
The men at the mike didn't spare the details. The
leleviewers were taken to Mac's .suite in th St. Francis.
Here we saw the glass he was going to threw his false
teeth in, the papers that were left for him to read, and
the plush bed in which he was going to sleep. Sort of
â€¢a modern-day "George Washington slept here" affair.
Then the televiewers saw the seething, teeming
niol> on (he street outside the hotel. A lady fainted,
and actually couldn't fall down because she was so
lightly packed in. A motorcycle cop ran over an
other lady's toe and received a tongue lashing.

The scene shifted to the Airport. Here, a crew of
nervous-voiced announcers scurried around to find
people to interview to fill in the time gap. Just as it
seemed that the last person who had anything to say
was interviewed, an announcement came that the
General's plane has been delayed a half-hour.
Gad, what a dilemma. Here was real, stark drama.
How were the announcers going to fill in the extra
half-hour? An Airport attendant who hadn't been in
terviewed (all the others had been interviewed) was
found. The mikeman, his voice dripping with curi
osity, asked the attendant what his job was. The at
tendant muttered something about keeping the airport
spic and span, and cleaning out the heads. The an
nouncer cleared his throat, smiled a sickly smile, and
passed on to .someone else.
Finally, the liig moment arived. As Mac Arthur's
plane touched the ground, the announcer shrieked
feverishly, "This is the most exciting moment in my
life!" The lousy ham.
The plane taxied to a stop, the door swung open,
and a uniformed figure stood in the doorway. A tu
multuous cheer went up!!! Upon closer examination it
was just a steward who stood disinterestedly in the
doorway picking his teeth.
To make a long story short, Dugout Doug arrived,
made a speech, and was carted away to the St. Fran
cis.
How do I feel about all this? I'm starting a Mae-
Arthur for President Club. All those who wish to join
the club may meet me in the Cellar phone booth at
2 p.m.
