## Another Viewpoint on Spain Today 
### 
(Editor's Note: Following is a translation of a let -
tor written in Spanish by Senorita Susana Gon
zalez. visiting lecturer in the Romanic Languages
Department. The letter is addressed to Francisco
Ik-net, ASSU foreign scholar from Mad rid, who was
interviewed in yesterday's Daily.)
Dear Mr. Benet:
Permit me to make some observations on yesterday's
article.
In the first place, I note you are anti-Franco. In
the second place, a good many observations you make
about present-day Sp un are incorrect. I do not deny
you the right to oppose Franco; you are entitled to
think what you wish. However, I must regret some
of your allegations because of your lack of true knowl
edge. Furthermore, you unquestionably intend that
the readers of the Daily should be exposed to more
lalse ideas about the truth of our history and native
land. To judge from your method of procedure, it is
not necessary for a person to be a foreigner to be an
enemy of Spain, because there are many Spaniards
who do not deserve to bear that name.
You speak of FUE, a student organization extant be
fore our Civil War. There is undoubtedly a good deal
to be said in regard to some of its activities for the
welfare of the students. I was a student of the Univer
sity of Madrid from 1934-35 and part of the year of
193(1. I know very well what took place in that Uni
versity before and after that date, because from 1942
i was a member of the faculty of that university as a
professor of history.
You speak of the activities that the FUE initiated in
1944. It is certain that you are ill informed about what
happened that particular year. Mr. Benet, tell me
how long it has been since you left Spain?
Tri like fashion you speak of lack of freedom of
speech and expression and of Church and state con
trol of student thinking. None of these allegations
contains a grain of truth. Why don't you make an
effort to verify your information? Be honorable
enough to speak as a Spaniard, and not as an enemy
of Franco.
The maximum expression of all your untruths is
contained in the statement, "Professors cannot teach
unless they are members of the civil order created by

the Churchâ€”the Opus Dei." Let me assure you that I,
holding the academic rank of Professor of History
(Profesora Activa), and many of my colleagues, are
not members of this much-attacked institution. You
should use more discretion, Mr. Benet.
You also speak of the poor living conditions and of
the disgust of workers of Catalonia. I will by-pass the
present and past rebellions in this province; much has
occurred that your Stanford readers do not know of.
I will merely remind you that Catalonia does not rep
resent the feelings of the whole of Spain.
You complain that the U.S. might commit the error
of supporting Franco. With all the gratitude that I
feel toward this wonderful nation, I feel certain that
Spain on its own resources will continue to pave her
own way forward, unaffected by the hegemonies and
political systems of other nations and states.
I regret having to call your attention publicly to
your lack of discretion, but I believe that my remarks
may prove useful to you since you wish to parade your
lack of knowledge. Political resentment or possible
failure of personal achievement may have influenced
your thinking. ; Sea mas leal a su patria y as su nom
bre de espanol!
