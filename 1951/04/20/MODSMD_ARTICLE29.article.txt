# BUSINEES SCHOOL
## New Lounge Built 
### GORDON ADDISON 
The sight of hammers, saws,
arid piles of dusty old books in
the hands of students in Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness these days means more
than the establishment of a new
lounge for the book-weary "Biz
Boys."
The activity of about 75 business
students in the school's basement,
which will house the lounge, indi
cates the degree to which the men
are transforming book learning into
everyday business techniques.
50« Man-Hours
by Jim Parker, second-year
business student, and mythical
"president of a large construction
company," the students recorded a
grand total of 500 man-hours of
work in the project during winter
quarter;
Moreover, for over a year, Par
ker's high planning board has been
making arrangements with the Uni
versity which must handle the funds
for the $5,000 project.
It's been a group project of the
Business School Club, which has
I ing needed a lounge similar to the
new Ixjw School's lounge.
Hi/. B«»ys Donated
Jim Jack, who holds the purse
' trings in Parker's complicated or
ganizational chart, headed a drive
which produced about $1,000 in
' hiding support from 85 per cent of
the Business School students along
with faculty contributions. One stu
dent gave $25.
Donations from Business School
alumni have boosted the project's
;• s( t.i to about $2,100 — enough to
establish the lounge with a mini
mum of equipment.
After this year, co-chairmen of
the furnishings committee Bill

Thorpe and Chuck Stein foresee an
extension of the furnishings prob
lem to future classes in the Busi
ness School, who will receive the
m.iin benefits from the lounge.
Students Ilolp Out
Work so far h;is been conducted
by Don Rohde, whom company
president Parker likes to call his
"works superintendent." During the
past three months Rohde has as
signed work to student volunteers.
Foreman Rohde had his "white
collar Biz Boys" carrying thousands
of volumes of dusty old books up
and down the stairs in the .six tiers
of library slacks. Every book in the
stacks had to be moved at least one
tier up or down.
Alter the basement level was

cleared, the workers started on a
grand reconstruction movement in
an adjoining basement room where
at least 1,500 square feet of new
shelves had to be constructed.
The goal of this student enter
prise by the end of spring quarter
is a 50x30-foot lounge with small
partitions to divide the room into
smaller areas. Decorated in modern
design, the lounge will have plastic
coated screens built into the open
partitions.
Working closely with the project
are L. W. Cutler, director of the
Business School Library; S. F. Post,
jof the University business office;
«nd Jack MinkofT, who will take
! over as chairman of the project next
I year.


BIZ CLUB LOUNGE Biz students Jim Parker, Don Rohde, and
Jack Minkoff make plans for their new $5,000 lounge being built
by student volunteers.
