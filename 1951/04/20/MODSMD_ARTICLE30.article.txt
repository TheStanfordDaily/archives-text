# Then the Axe Wasn't There

### 

TRADITIONS DAYâ€”For a few minutes yesterday the Main Library was a Berkeley bank and the
date was April 3, 1930, as the freshmen staged a re-enactment of the "Immortal 21" in the act of
grabbing the axe from its unsuspecting guardians. This was one of several Farm traditions illus
trated by the freshman class yesterday as their part of Traditions Day.
