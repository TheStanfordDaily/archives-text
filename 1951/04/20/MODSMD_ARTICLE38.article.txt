# Record-Seeking Swimmers To Tangle With Uclans
## 
### 
Stanford will entertain UCLA's
swimming team tomorrow morning
at 11 in the Encina Pools, in what
should be the most entertaining
dual meet of the year.
Entertaining, that is, if you like
to see Stanford win by a large mar
gin and break several PCC records
doing it.
Bobby Thompson swam a prac
tice 220 in 2:09.6 yesterday, and
the Florence, Arizona, lad is a
/(«iod bet to break the PCC record
lie set last week of 2:1(1.2.
Yesterday's practice opened a few
eyes as to the backstroking situa
tion on the varsity. After Bruce
Putnam, who doesn't seem to like
the stroke, the next best man has
been Dick Bennett, who did 2:29 for
tin- 200 yards early in the year.
Bert Holiday toured a 100 back in
1:03.0 yesterday, to give Coach Tom
Haynie a legal excuse to take Put
nam, the team's best freestyle
.sprinter, out of the backstroke.
Bennett timed a 100 in 1:05, and
the two jumped in half an hour
later to swim a 200. Holiday fin
ished in 2:21, the best done by a
Stanford backstrokcr this year, and
Bennett, a Punahou, Hawaii, prod
uct, did. 2:23, cut six seconds off his
previous best time.
Haynie announced yesterday that
Ct-orge Mowat and Bob Grisemer
would swim the sprints tomorrow.
(Jrisemer has a best of 23.7 in the
1)0, while Mowat, has done 24.0 in
this race, and the two have done
54.2 and 53.8 respectively in the
100.
Best chances for PCC records,
after the 220, are in the breast
stroke, the 440, and the four-man
freestyle relay. Bob Froien will
vie against UCLA's Monte Nitz
kowski in the hreaststroke, while
Pete Cole, who did 4:41.5 yester
day, will go in the quarter.


AFTER A RECORD—Pete Cole, from Santa Monica, will go
after the PCC 440 freestyle record tomorrow, in the Stanford-
UCLA swimming meet. Pete's best is 4:40.5, while the record
is 4:43.
