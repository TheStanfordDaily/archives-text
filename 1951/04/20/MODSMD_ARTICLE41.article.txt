## PETE GROTHE Punts and Pitches Sports Quickies

A few weeks back, we wrote a treatise on the cheapness at
Stanford—how Hank Luisetti had to pay to get into a basketball
game, and how former baseball coach Harry Wolter had to shell
ou* to see a baseball contest.
Two weeks ago it happened again. Wolter had to plunk down 80

cents to see the team that he once
joached play Santa Clara. We
wouldn't doubt that it General Mac-
Arthur marched into Stanford with
William Randolph Hearst as a page
boy he'd have to pay to see an ath
letic event. Poor Doug is out of a
job and will have to apply for un
employment insurance soon, but
that wouldn't touch the gatekeep
ers' unbending hearts.
* * *
Insiders say that the two "new
comers" most likely to make first
string next year are tackle Dick
(la.it and end Al Kirklaiul. We
mean "newcomers" in that they
haven't played varsity ball yet.
Kirkland is a transfer from
Southern Cal. He played both of
fensive and defensive end for the
SC frosh before transferring to the
Farm. Since a transfer loses a year
of eligibility, he spent last year
working out with the Braves, but
he couldn't play for them. The 200-
pound Kirkland is a demon on de
fense, and probably will be placed
on the defensive platoon.
Remember the name Dick Gant.
You're going to hear about him for
the next three years. The 205-pound
All-CIF from Covina was a brilliant
tackle on the frosh team last year.
His main assets are that he is amaz
ingly fast and agile for a big man.

Another man who has drawn no
j tiee l'rom Chuck Taylor and Joe
Kuetz is Phil Wilson, a sof.h guard
j who transferred from Los Angeles
| City College. The 203-pound Wil
son is a sharp blocker, something
Stanford needed in the worst pos
sible way last year.

Swimstress Sharon Geary has won
| more laurels.
We did a piece on her last week,
and even as the copy paper was
spilling out of our typewriter, she
was capturing first place in the 200-
yard freestyle in the Women's Na
j tional Championships. Incidentally,
I she also set a record in that event.
Sharon also placed second in the
! 100-yard freestyle and second in
the 100 backstroke. All in a day's
work.

Farm. Since a transfer loses a year
of eligibility, he spent last year
working out with the Braves, but
he couldn't play for them. The 200-
pound Kirkland is a demon on de
fense, and probably will be placed
on the defensive platoon.
Remember the name Dick Gant.
You're going to hear about him for
the next three years. The 205-pound
All-CIF from Covina was a brilliant
tackle on the frosh team last year.
His main assets are that he is amaz
ingly fast and agile for a big man.

Another man who has drawn no
j tiee l'rom Chuck Taylor and Joe
Kuetz is Phil Wilson, a sof.h guard
j who transferred from Los Angeles
| City College. The 203-pound Wil
son is a sharp blocker, something
Stanford needed in the worst pos
sible way last year.

Swimstress Sharon Geary has won
| more laurels.
We did a piece on her last week,
and even as the copy paper was
spilling out of our typewriter, she
was capturing first place in the 200-
yard freestyle in the Women's Na
j tional Championships. Incidentally,
I she also set a record in that event.
Sharon also placed second in the
! 100-yard freestyle and second in
the 100 backstroke. All in a day's
work.

Coed — Why, darling, this is so

A few weeks back, we wrote a treatise on the cheapness at
Stanford—how Hank Luisetti had to pay to get into a basketball
game, and how former baseball coach Harry Wolter had to shell
ou* to see a baseball contest.
Two weeks ago it happened again. Wolter had to plunk down 80

cents to see the team that he once
joached play Santa Clara. We
wouldn't doubt that it General Mac-
Arthur marched into Stanford with
William Randolph Hearst as a page
boy he'd have to pay to see an ath
letic event. Poor Doug is out of a
job and will have to apply for un
employment insurance soon, but
that wouldn't touch the gatekeep
ers' unbending hearts.

Insiders say that the two "new
comers" most likely to make first
string next year are tackle Dick
(la.it and end Al Kirklaiul. We
mean "newcomers" in that they
haven't played varsity ball yet.
Kirkland is a transfer from
Southern Cal. He played both of
fensive and defensive end for the
SC frosh before transferring to the
Farm. Since a transfer loses a year
of eligibility, he spent last year
working out with the Braves, but
he couldn't play for them. The 200-
