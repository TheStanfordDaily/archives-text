## Golfers Face SC 
### 
Stanford's undefeated golf team,
winner of six straight, will be put
|to their severest test when they
j meet San Jose State today at San
j Jose, and the mighty Trojans from
USC here tomorrow morning.
USC, also unbeaten, boasts one of
the finest teams in the school's his
tory. Numbers one and two for the
Trojans probably will be Bob Da
vies and Bob Pastni, two of the out
standing collegiate golfers in the
country. The meet promises to be
an extremely close one, since USC
and Stanford have each defeated
defeated UCLA by the same score.
Today at San Jose State, the
Cards will also have a tough day
in store for them. Number one man
for the Spartans is Ken Venturi,
1950 San Francisco City champion,
and 1951 Northern California Inter
collegiate champion. It was Ven
] turi who edged Stanford's Roland
j Conklin in the finals of that tour
â–  nament. The Venturi - McElyea
match promises to be one of the
top matches of the year.
Stanford will probably have the
following lineup for both days:
number one, Dick McElyea; two,
Jack Knosher; three, Roland Conk
lin; four, John Elliott; five, Art
Schroeder; and six, either Keith
j Beekmna or Cully Ingram.
