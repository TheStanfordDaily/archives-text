# Injury-Riddled Cindermen Enplane for Oxy Fracas
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Hit hard by sickness and in
jury, Coach Jack Weiershauser's
varsity trackmen will fly south
to Los Angeles to meet a slim
but powerful Occidental squad
tonight.
The depleted Card varsity, how
ever, will have new strength in pole
vaulter Bob Meyers, who just
turned out this week, and Wally
McCamant, reconverted quarter
miler, who came from behind to
place third in the 880 last Saturday.
Meyers cleared 12 ft. C in. in (
practice this week and is expected
< to help the Card cause to a great
! extent in the close-matched cinder
i meet.
Oxy'.s chief boast is four "iron
man" runners, John Barnes, Walt
McKiliben, Bob Rupreeht, and
Bob McMillen, who are scheduled
to enter three events each.
McKibben, Oxy's star sprinter,
has run a 9.8 hundred and a 21-flat
220 already this season. His chief

opposition will come from Stan- |
lord's Wilbur Taylor, who has stop- 1
peel the clocks at 21.3 twice this I
season.
Stanford's chief hope lies in the
field events where the Cards hope
to sweep the shot, discus, and jav
elin.
Bob Mathias, in addition to his
shot, discus, and low hurdle du
ties, will probably try the javelin
tonight.
Among the many Card trackmen
! who will not make the trip are:
broad jumper Merritt Van Sant—
1 lame leg; discus thrower lan Reed—
j tonsil infection; low hurdler Bob
Bryan — pulled muscle; javelin
thrower Dick Hennigan — sore el
! bow; half-miler Joss Scroggy—ear
