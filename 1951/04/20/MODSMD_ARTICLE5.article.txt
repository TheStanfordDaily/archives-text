# USC Challenges Vengeful Cards
## Indians Face Broncs Also 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
Those old pros, the collegiate
Yankees, the Southern Califor
nia Trojans, will invade the con
fines of the Sunken Diamond to
day at 3:15 when they take on
the Indians.
Presently riding at the top of the [
CIBA with four victories and no de- j
feats, the Trojans, led by Coach Rod j
Dedaux, boast some of the best glove j
and bat men in collegiate circles.
Tehre's A 1 Karan, the third base- j
man with the rifle arm. There's Bob
Lillis, clever fielding and hard clout- |
ing shortstop.
And there's double trouble in the
diminutive Charnofsky twins, Hal
and Stan, a pair of diamond orators
in addition to being great players at
their right field and second base po
sitions.
Human Needle
Add to this list the name of Pitcher
Tom Lovrich, alias the human needle,
who becomes the invisible man on
the mound when he turns sideways.
Beefy Bill Wills docs the receiving
for Troy, and basketballer Tom Riach
and Boh Hertel, a couple of outfield
acrobats, man the outer garden.
The Trojans bring a real baseball
circus into town, and it's a good one.
This is the club which beat the Pitts
burgh Pirates and the Hollywood
Stars this spring before the Mickey
Mantle-manned New York Yankees
trounced them, 15 to 1. This is the
club which beat Stanford twice, al
though outhit by a wide margin. And
this is the same club which gave
Santa Clara but four hits and one run
in two games.
But this is also the team which
Stanford edged out last year for the
CIBA crown, and it's a team which
plays far better at home than away.
The Trojans admittedly fear the
j Stanford pitching staff and know
what the bats of Dick Clegg, Bruce

Cameron, Jim Castagnoli, and Dick
Corzine can do.
Coach Everett Dean will call on
either Rog Osenbaugh or Joe Chez
to attempt the Trojan-taming job.
Tomorrow the Cards travel to
Santa Clara to meet the Broncos in a
double header which will begin at
1:30. The games will be played in
Washington Park and will be the last
meeting of the teams this year. Big
Jim Claypool and the pitcher who
doesn't work the SC game will hurl
against the Broncos with Bob Mur
phy, who chucked the neat three
hitter against USF, ready for relief.
