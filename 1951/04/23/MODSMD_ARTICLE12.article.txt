# Excom OK's $28,325 ASSU '51-'52 Budget
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
Shortly before 1 a.m. Friday morning, 14 weary Excom members
gave their final approval to an ASSU budget of $28,325 for the
'51—'52 school year.
Acceptance of the budget meant the "tend of almost six hours of
shaving expenses on almost every item and adding expenses in

only four instances. The final bal
anced budget is $5,875 less than the
current year's $34,200. Student man
ager Dave Elliott based his income
estimate for next year on a decline
in enrollment of approximately 1,400
students per quarter.
In every case, Excom abided by
the budget it tentatively approved
the first time around Thursday night
and which was published in Friday's
Daily.
The last item to be debated—
which didn't make the Friday issue
—was the appropriation to the In
stitute of International Relations.
Excom granted the lIR an addi
tional $200 to the $1,800 Elliott had
originally budgeted. Even the in
creased appropriation, however,
failed to meet llß's current year
allocation of $2,305.
A major stumbling block in the
1951-52 budge was the allocation to
Ted Hinshaw, pesident of Cardinals,
who had made several small
cuts in this year's allowance of $3,(540.
He finally deducted $1,000 which this
year had gone to sponsor the Louis
Armstrong dance, and wound up with
a request for $2,675, which was
granted.
Elliott asked, and Excom approved,
that Rally Com he allotted $1,300 next
year as compared with $1,840 this
year. During the discussion on this
allocation, it was suggested that
Rally Com save money over the years
by using plastic cards for card stunts
next year, but the idea was vetoed
by Rally Com representatives. This
year, the cards cost Rally Com $810.
Foreign Scholarship chairman
Phil Nielsen spoke at length on
why his group needed more than
the $4,500 the student manager had
set aside for it. It was estimated
$4,500 would be able to pay, along
with help from dormitories, frater
nities, and the University, all the
expenses except travel of seven
foreign scholars next year. Niel
sen said the committee could not
know how much government aid
would be forthcoming for travel
expenses until later in the quar
ter.
Excom decided to grant the sched
uled $4,500 with the understanding
that it may provide more money if
the emergency arises.
Karl Humiston of Men's Glee Club
interspersed a welcome note in the
proceedings when he told Excom that
his organization did not want any
ASSU help next year.
Ironically enough, it was a request
by this same organization for $180
last April that sent Excom members
into a post-midnight session of budg
et-cutting to provide the club with
funds,
Harvey Wagner of the Debate So
ciety requested $1,700 but received
only $1,300. Other cuts in next year's
budget over this year's wore:
Elections from $500 to S4OO,
Grants-in-aid from $3,000 to $2,000.
summer quarter ASSU from $1,000
to $700. gifts from $100 to $70, As
sociated Women Students from
$1,120 to $040, yell leaders from $200
to $195, and student manager from
$1,250 to $1,200.
Excom justified its reduction of the
elections budget on the theory that
the constitutional amendment elimi
nating the winter elections would be
passed by the voters Wednesday.
They also eliminated $40 sot. aside to
purchase food, for Election Board
mem hers.
The biggest increase in next
year's budget was for the ASSI! of
fice. which is to receive $7,000 in
stead of the $5,300 this year. Elliott
explained the increase was neces
sitated by the removal of the Con

Home bookkeeping job from the of
fice, which had provided a large
source of income.
Another addition was $475 appro
priated to the newly-created Public
Relations Committee. Elliott cut an
additional allowance for a salary for
the director.
After all the money had been ap
propriated, $2,000 was left to form
next year's contingency fund. This
year's Excom had a fund totaling
$3,100.
Thus the completed budget for
1951-52 is as follows:
