LONDON — Minister of Labor
Aneurin Bevan split the British So
cialist cabinet wide open today by
resigning because the government
decided to charge for false teeth and
eye glasses under its National
Health Plan.
Bevan's resignation plunged the
government into a crisis which may
lead to its early fall—possibly this
week—and a general election which
to all indications would put Winston
Churchill and his Conservatives
back in power.
He has been disaffected —as have
other Labor left - wingers — for
months. But the break came when
the cabinet decided to charge people
under its womb-to-tomb National
Health Plan half the cost of the false
teeth and eye glasses they get.
It is the biggest cabinet crisis
since Winston Churchill took the
Prime Ministry from Neville Cham
berlin in 1940 and the biggest Labor
party split since Ramsay Mac Do
nald entered a coalition with the
Conservatives in 1931.'
