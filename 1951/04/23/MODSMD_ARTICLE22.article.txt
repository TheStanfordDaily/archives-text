### 
Three candidates for ASSU
president in last week's primary
were found guilty of violating
electioneering regulations and
sentenced to work at the Con
Home by Election Judgment
Board last Friday.
All three were found guilty of
having campaign posters illegally
put up on Quad. The illegal post
ing was done on History corner, in
the Law Building, and on Physics
corner.
One candidate was given 15 hours
suspended to five; another 15 hours
suspended to ten; and the third 15
suspended to five. Fifteen is the
usual number of hours given vio
lators.
The suspensions were made in
consideration of the placcs where
the posters were put up and the
candidates' complete lack of knowl
edge of the violations. Election
Board chairman Jack Hunter ex
plained.
Election Board, whose function is
to judge electioneering violations, is
made up of Gil Jonas and Dorothy
Thomas, ASSU Excom; Winnie
Ainsworth, Women's Council; and
Jim Hammond, Men's Council.
