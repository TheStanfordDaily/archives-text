Every now and then, as Director of In
formation Fred Glover puts it, Stanford's stu
dent government, its publications, and its
various student groups should be told "what a
terrific job they're doing."
Just who should administer this "pat on the
Lack"—assuming it's deserved —is a touchy
question, however. Excom last quarter decided
a "student body public relations committee"
would help do the trick. We think it will.
Nevertheless, it's always gratifying — and
possibly more valuable—to receive a bouquet
that's thrown in from the outside.
About a week ago, nine student leaders from
the University of Oregon spent a weekend here
studying Stanfords' unique "deferred living" or
"living in" setup.
They talked with ASSU President Ted
Buttner, AWS prexy lane Troxell, and IFC
President Dave Larimer, to mention only a few.
What they wanted was detailed information on
the operation of a "residence" university, such
as Stanford is.
Eventually, the nine-man committee will draft
a report recommending just what could be
done to transform the people at Oregon into a
more closely-knit group.
For us, however, the most significant result
of the Stanford junket was the impression of
homogeneity the Oregonians received from our

own student body and faculty. As one Daily
Emerald columnist reported later, . . the in
teresting thing was that the opinions of these
two groups (student and faculty) were so
similar."
Maybe the reason for the similarity is trace
able to the fact that we ARE a residence uni
versity, with 90 per cent of our students living
on campus and coming into daily contact with
faculty and administration.
Still, we're sure the explanation lies deeper
ihan that. By way of illustration, we point to
student-faculty talent shows, a foreign scholar
ship program in which university, student gov
ernment, and living groups share the expense,
and such outstanding institutions as the Honor
Code and the student-faculty rating system.
All of these are but a few of the student-in
spired activities that have received whole
hearted faculty backing. Surely they are worth
a "pat on the back."
If we were to tell Oregon anything, we
would tell them why our student-faculty pro
gram has been so profitable. We would point
to examples and vouchsafe they could be
emulated almost anywhere. Furthermore,
we would soft pedal the "residence" part.
Although important, it deserves only a small
share of the credit due when speaking of
Stanford's success in the art of living to
gether.
