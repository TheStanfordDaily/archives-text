To the Editor:
When reading last week the declarations of Mr.
Benet about the conditions in Spain published by the
Daily I was really surprised because I am Spanish, I
have been been a student in Spain before and after
the civil war, and I have lived in the most critical
period of modern Spanish history since the last King
Alfonso XIII was expelled from Spain in 1931, before
coming to Stanford in 1949.
I believe I know something about Spain and what I
know happens to be exactly the same as that of Miss
Susana Gonzalez of the Spanish Department who in a
very fine and discreet way and with the very natural
feelings of a patriot who loves her country with all
her heart, gave Mr. Benet a good lesson of historic
truthfulness and dignity.
... During my attendance at Spanish universi
ties nobody compelled me to belong to any political
party. ... I was as happy and free at the Spanish
universities during Franco's regime as I am here
. . . in contrast to the deplorable conditions that ex
isted in Spain before the counter-revolution of 19:50.
1 do not deny that economic conditions in Spain are
not satisfactory on account of the desolation of the
country after the Civil War, the results of World War
11, the enormous increase of the Spanish population
since 1939, and the boycott of the UN due primarily
to pressure from the Soviet Union. . . .
Spain has had bad days increased by unusual
Wrought in the last lew years, all of which decreased
its valuable electric power and made necessary some
restrictions in its supplv. . . .
. . . Mr. Benet is truthful in telling that some indus
tries could not work the whole week, but he does not
say that the workers received the same salary as if
they had done the work. Franco's regime has helped
the workers as no other precding regime has done
before. There is no income tax.
Mr. Benet describes Spain as governed by the dic
tator and the church, both in agreeable friendship.
One of his intellectual brothers. Mr. Andoni de As
tigaraga, describes the anti-Catholocism of the so
called 'crusade (his words) of Franco in a series of
articles published some time ago in Euzko Deya
(Buenos Aires). So what? In Spain the church and
the state are two different organizations and they do
not interfere with each other.
I think Franco is a very good soldier, a great patriot,
and a gentleman. When the boycott came, originated
by the USSR, Franco stood firmly and fearlessly, a
gesture which pleased all the Spanish people and won
l')i him the approbation of,many who were not pre
viously on his side. Among other things, Franco kept
Spain out of the World War II (in spite of foreign pres
suie) with the gratitude of the Spanish people. Per
sonally I am of the opinion that general Franco is
waiting lor Europe to reach normality and he then
will restore the monarchy. ADOLFO G. ABRINES
