# Rebuttal 'Puzzles' Him

To the Editor:
I was very much puzzled by Srtn. Gonzalez Rubio's
rebuttal to Senor Bent's "allegations" to the Daily.
Senor Benet's statements seemed to be of a rational
and reasonably objective nature. . .
He cites conditions and forces acting on the work
ers of Barcelona. He speaks of a black market, of yov
ernment corruption, of lack of power to run plants
and of a war-weary and exhausted people. Srta. Rubio

neatly by-passed the Catalonia issue by saying that
Stanford readers are not acquainted with much of
what has happened there, and that Catalonia does not
represent "the feelings of the whole of Spain." Let me
ask you who represents the feelings of the whole of
Spain, Srta. Rubio, Franco, perhaps?
You grant Senor Benet the freedom of expression,
you say: "I do not deny you the right to oppose Fran
co, you are entitled to think what you wish." Yet
you exhort him to be "honorable enough to speak as a
Spaniard, and not as an enemy of Franco."
And I ask you, how must a Spaniard reconcile these
two most confusing statements? By a jail sentence for
painting propaganda slogans against the government,
or perhaps by being more "discreet?"
Beyond the fact that you taught in the Universidad
de Madrid without belonging to the Opus Dei, I find
that you have proven nothing, you have puzzled me
much. . . .
