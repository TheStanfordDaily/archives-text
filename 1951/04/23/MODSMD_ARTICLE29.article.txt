# ...No Democratic Rights

To the Editor:
In reply to the letter of Dr. Gonzalez regarding
Spain, I would like to make a comment.
Twelve years ago Spain surrendered to Franco. The
workers' movement was crushed. Thousands were
thrown in jail and thousands were executed. Over the
piles of bodies of the working class of Spain, Franco
built the structure of his totalitarian dictatorship.
From that day to this, the workers of Spain have had
no democratic rights whatever. The standard of liv
ing has been reduced below subsistence. Any man or
woman who showed an ounce of resistance to the re
gime was dragged off to prison. The workers, de
prived of the right to unionize, were subjected to the
most intensive exploitation. The general poverty of
the country was increased by the unspeakable cor
ruption which permeated every section of the govern
ment and the economy.
Then on 12 March in Barcelona 250.000 workers
arose in a general strike, the biggest threat to his re
gime that Franco has ever faced. As of 14 March, ac
cording to the POUM (Socialist), aimed troops from
all over Spain, walking the streets of Barcelona in
groups of 14 with riHes cocked, had made over 5,000
arrests, strikes being prohibited in Spain.
It might have helped had the visiting lecturer in
Spanish seen the conditions of the working class in
Spain instead of remaining, evidently, in an ivory
tower. . . .
