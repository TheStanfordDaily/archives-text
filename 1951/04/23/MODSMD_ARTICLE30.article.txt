# Ignores Common People

To the Editor:
Certainly Dr. Gonzalez's views on Spain, whatever
they are, are not shared by most of the Spaniards of
the lower classes.
Evidently she was not in much contact with the
common people, for it she were she would know, e.g.,
the poor consider potatoes a rarity and live mainly on
leeks, beans, etc.
She implies there is freedom of thought and speech.
Why is there no open opposition to Franco? Certainly
a criterion of democracy!
She says Spain will "on its own resources . . . con
tinue to pave her - own way forward.'! Why must the
U.S. supply money and grain? Spain hasn't had a
world war to go through; if it were a politically sound
government, it would be forging into prominence as a
world power by now, not begging aid.
She refers to Catalonians as unrepresentative. Why
then did the enormous general strike in March, of a
quarter million workers, spread to other towns, and
even in lesser force to Madrid?
. . . Why does she refer to Catalonians as rebellious
when Mr. Benet only said Catalonian "workers can
only work three days a week?" Non sequitur!
