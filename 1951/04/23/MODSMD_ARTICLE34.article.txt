# Runners Arrive With Torch; Brave Guards Stave off Attack

### 
The Olympic torch got to Rossot
ti's Friday afternoon and the Olym
pic flame got lit so the "Olympians"
could too in the proper atmosphere;
but it all could never have been
without the unstinting devotion to
duty of torch-bearer Wayne Wil
liams' convoy guardsmen.
Three-fourths of the way across
the Lake Lugunita leg of the route,
the torch-bearers were attacked by
"five or six" marauding canoes bent
on dunking Williams, torch and all.
Williams was carrying the torch
in three canoes lashed together with
a one - canoe escort. Finding the
three canoes an unsinkable unit, the
raiders resorted to splashing tactics
in an attempt to extinguish the
flame. The flame "sputtered once or
twice" according to witnesses, but
kept burning.
Williams' redoubtable defenders,
casting personal safety to the winds,
leaped to his defense and, taking to
the water, proceeded to foil the plot
by quickly upsetting the anti-
Greeks.
Prominent among the routed at
tacking vessels were the Breakers
and Phi Kap canoes.
