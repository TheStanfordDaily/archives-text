# Occidental Blasts Card Track Team 68 to 63
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Despite a valiant anchor relay try
by Stanford's Bill Storum, Occiden
tal College, a new power in colle
giate track, edged an injury-ridden
Indian team 08 to 03 in Los Angeles
Friday night.
The score of the nip-and-tuck
meet was tied at 03 all going into the
mile relay event, and at the end of
three laps Oxy's favored team was
seven yards in front.
Storum took the baton for the In
dians and gained a full five yards
on Oxy's fleet quarter - miler Ted
Ruprecht, but his closing bid for a
Stanford victory fell just two yards
short.
Both Stanford and Occidental
set national records in the excit
ing meet.
For the first timo in collegiate
history, three men from a single
school threw the shot over 51 feet.
The record-setting puts were as fol
lows: Captain Lew Davis, 51 ft. 7%
in.; Bob Mathias, 51 ft. lVa in., and
Chuck Hokanson, 51 ft. 1% in.
Another shot put record may be
set in the USC meet in Stanford
Stadium Saturday where the In
dians could conceivably score only
a third place.
In a triangular meet with Michi
gan and Illinois, Trojan Parry
O'Brien heaved the shot 55 ft. 4[->
in., and teammate Jess Swope threw
51 ft. 2 in.
Oxy's Bob McMillen ran a tor
rid 4:1. 7 mile, to set a new 1951
outdoor record, and then came
roaring back to win the two-mile
in 9:45.5.
Stanford's Bob Simon, in his first
varsity two-mile, toured the gruel
ing eight laps in approximately 9:49
for second place.
Occidental's star dashman Walt
McKibben beat teammate Ruprecht

! and Stanford's Wilbur Taylor to the
wire in the 440, and was clocked at
47.8 seconds, also the nation's fast
est outdoor time to date.
McKibben and Ruprecht came
from behind to shade Card Maurice
Parsons in the 220, after Parsons
! had led all the way. The race, which
;was won in 21.5, was extremely
j close and could have gone either
way.
Earlier in the evening, an Indian
trio composed of Parsons, Pete
McKay. and Jim Pollock surprised
| everyone by sweeping the hun
! died. Parsons' winning time was
9.9.
Stanford's new pole vaulter, Bob
Meyers, was tied up from extensive
midweek practice, and placed third
at 11 feet.
Stanford's Bob Mathias, although
failing to place in the javelin, won
the discus and the low hurdles in
addition to his second place in the
shot.
In the very close low hurdles race,
Mathias won by a scant two yards
over Stanford's Jim Pollock, who
closed fast. Mathias' winning marks
were 24 flat in the low hurdles, and
150 ft. 10% in. in the discus.
Ed Triplett of the Cards got off a
180-ft. '-i-in. heave to win the jave
lin, but Oxy surprised by taking
second and third.
In the high hurdles, the Indians
; grabbed eight big points when
Darrell Kreitz and Storum placed
one-two. Storum was only two
steps behind Kreitz's 14.7 winning
! time.
With the absence of Stanford's
I star broad jumper, Meritt Van Sant,
1 Oxy's Schagel won the event with
22 ft. s'v in. Indians Pete McKay
j and Jeff Mc√üae placed second and
third.
