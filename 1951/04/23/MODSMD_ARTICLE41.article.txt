# Indians Swamp Bruins 64 to 11
## 
### 
With Pete Cole and Bobby
| Thompson setting a new PCC rec
ord in the 220 freestyle, the Card
j swimming team waxed a feeble
UCLA squad, 04 to 11, Saturday
j morning in the Stanford pool.
Cole and Thompson, a junior and
sophomore at Stanford respectively,
1 swpm a thrilling dead heat in the
j furlong in the fastest time ever
j done in West Coast college swim
ming. Even with Thompson at 100
yards, Cole moved out two feet at
150 yards, or six laps, but Thompson
closed the gap at 175 end they swam
stroke for stroke all the rest of the
way.
The time posted by the two In
dians was 2:10.0, just two-tenths of
a second under the record last week
by Thompson against Cal. The
judges' decision gained the approval
of the highly partisan crowd, which
was glad to see both swimmers get
a piece of the record.
The 200-yard breaststroke, billed
as the closest race of the meet, saw
Bob Frojen win by a body-length
over the Bruins' Monte Nitzkowski,
in the time of 2:24.0. Frojen saw
Nitzkowski start to pull up on the
seventh lap, and put on a strong
sprint to win.
Bob Grisemer, Stanford senior,
i won the 50 freestyle in the fastest
j time done in any Stanford meet all
I season, 23.9. Grisemer, who barely
touched out George Mowat, looms
1 as the favorite in the PCC meet 50,
I along with the Indians' three other
I top-notch sprinters, Mowat, Chuck
Kelly, and Bob Wycoff.
Coach Tom Huynie was pleased by
the Stanford divers, Bill Glathe and
John Miller, who swept that event
by taking first and second respec
tively. Glathe has been improving
steadily all season, and is given an
outside chance of beating USC's
great diver, Johnny McCormack,
national AAU tower champ.
