### EARL ODELL 
Coach Chuck Taylor wound up
the second week of spring practice
Saturday with heavy scrimmages
which brought to light many good
performances by various squad
members and the team as a whole.
Blocking and tackling employed
in the scrimmages was of the rock
'em. sock 'em type, and the coaches
were pleased with the results.
Among those who looked particu
larly outstanding in the Saturday
morning drills were:
Big Bill McColl playing his usual
All - American form. Bill grabbed
many a pass during the course of
the morning from among a crowd
of defenders.
Sam Morley, up from last year's
freshman club. Sam, an end, drew
gasps from the 50 - odd spectators
who lined the field with some of his
McColl - like catches. Once during
the scrimmage he jumped high into
the air and with one hand caught a
soit 30-yard throw by quarterback
Dick Ilorn. Morley. it appears, will
take a lot of pressure off McColl

next year and may very well equal
some of Bills' past performances.
Doug Pinto, converted from end
to fullback during the spring ses
sion. Doug was placed at the full
back post mainly because of his
blocking ability, but from the looks
of some of the runs he was making
—on one occasion he broke off
tackle for an 80 - yard touchdown
run—he may be called on for more
than blocking next season.
Tackle Len Kaprelian. all 250
pounds of him. Len, who last sea
son was hindered by his slowness,
surprised everyone Saturday with
his new-found speed. He'll be a
great asset in patching up weak
nesses in the defensive line.
Ted Tanner, a center playing mid
dle linebacker. He and Jesse Cone,
who plays middle guard, teamed up
to make a brick wall over center.
Dave Eldridge, who was ineli
gible last year after playing quar
terback on the '49 frosh squad. Dave
was defensive halfback Saturday
along with Joe St. Geme, another
'49 freshman quarterback.
