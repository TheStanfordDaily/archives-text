# Interfaith Council Aids All Religions

### BILL STOLTZE 
One of the most frequently
quoted quips of Mark Twain is
his observation that "Everybody
talks about the weather, but no
body ever does anything about
it." Were it not for the activities
of a few campus groups, the
same thing might be said about
student apathy toward religion
at Stanford.
If you ask one of the members of
Stanford's Interfaitli Council about
its purpose, he probably won't tell
you in so many words, "Our pur
pose is to do something about stu
dent apathy toward religion." Nev
ertheless, that is what the work of
this group adds up to.
Many Religions
Interfaith Council is a student
group composed of people belong
ing to almost every religious group
on campus.
Baptists, Catholics, Quakers, Jews,
Methodists, Mormons, Christian Sci
entists, Presbyterians, Episcopal
ians. Hindus, Congregationalists,
Unitarians, Lutherans, and others
have sat around the council table
at one time or another.
Many of the religious groups have
regular representatives who are
permanent members of the council.
The group meets about five times a
quarter to discuss common prob
lems and to further religious under
standing.
Pamphlet Printed
The council also compiles infor
mation for the pamphlet, "Religious
Fellowship," which is issued to in
coming freshmen each year.
Ann Livingston, current presi
dent of Interfaith Council, empha
sized that evfcrybne is invited to at
tend the group's meetings whether
or not he is affiliated with any par
ticular religion.
Such topics as concepts of God,
different kinds of faith, immortal
ity, and religious intermarriage
have been discussed in the past.
Besides discussing controversial
issues and hearing talks from vari
ous religious leaders, Interfaith
Council also tries to solve problems
common to the various groups rep
resented.
At present the Council is peti
tioning the University to give vari
ous religious groups the privilege of
meeting in University-owned build
ings.
