# French Gobs Tour Farm
## 
### 
The French navy invaded Stan
ford yesterday and, GO strong, toured
the campus. Escorted by volunteer
girls, many of whom knew no
French, they visited Union Court,
Quad, Hoover Tower, Lake Lag, and
even Rosso til's.
The men, numbering about 15 of
ficers and 45 enlisted men, journeyed
by bus from San Francisco where
they arc stationed to board their
American-made ships before sailing
for duty in the Far East.
The visit was made possible by
the lIR and the French Department.
Mrs. Katherine Peterson of the
French Department; Tom Bartlett,
president of IIR; Marge Witter, so
cial chairman of Maison Francaise;
Jeanne Marie Villar, and Phillippc
Berthet all helper! in the project.
Although the officers spoke Eng
lish, few of the sailors did, and they
listened to explanations with grin
ning shyness. One sailor had heard
that American girls liked gum and,
accordingly, upon arrival, presented
his guide with a pack.
Lake Lag became the scene of
near-casualty when five members of
the touring group took to the water
in a canoe. The boat rocked peri
lously and an alarmed lifeguard fol
lowed in a second boat as shore
spectators began to place bets on the
outcome of the escapade.
Hoover Tower, usually closed to
visitors on Sundays, opened espe
cially yesterday to admit the sail
ors. The tower has not done this in
many years.
After the tours, the navy dined at
Union, Lag, Branner, and several of
the Row houses.
