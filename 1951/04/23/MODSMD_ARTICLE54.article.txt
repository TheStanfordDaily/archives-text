Research aimed at determining
suitability of a number of materials
—some of them standard equipment
in any kitchen—as potential substi
tutes for blood plasma will be done
by Stanford Medical School physi
ologists under a research contract
received by the University from the
Office of Naval Research.
President Wallace Sterling an
nounced that this research, to be

| headed jointly by Dr. J. M. Crismon,
| executive head of the Physiology
Department, and Dr. George A. Fei
gen, instructor in physiology, is part
of a nation-wide program designed
to stock-pile a suitable transfusion
j substitute.
Even at present the Red Cross is
| having difficulty getting sufficient
blood donors to meet the needs of
I United States troops in Korea.
