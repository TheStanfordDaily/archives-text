# MacArthur Dispute Draws Comment From Sterling
## President Cites Insufficient Data At Student Government Assembly 
### 
We do not have sufficient facts on the Mac Arthur situation to
pass judgment, Dr. Wallace Sterling told an audience which only
half-filled Memorial Hall for yesterday's Student Government Day
assembly.
Pointing out that citizens could get two kinds of knowledge

about government—(he scientific or 1
factual, and the artful or humanistic j
—Dr. Sterling cited the Mac Arthur
affair as a contemporary example of ;
the latter. He said:
"With totally insufficient data at
our disposal, in this circumstance we
are being exposed on every hand to
that in government which is artful." |
He mentioned the following mat
ters on which he believed the public
should he further informed:
1. The unpublished report which
Gen. Albert Wedcmeyer made on
conditions in China.
2. The opinions the Joint Chiefs of
Staff gave Mac Arthur on the conduct
of the Korean war.
3. The ideas expressed by Mac-
Arthur in his Wake Island conference
with President Truman last fall.
Candidate Qualification
First emphasizing the importance
of measuring a candidate's intelli
gence and integrity by the way in
which he presents facts, Dr. Sterling
went on to stress that "the individual
has the responsibility of registering
his position." He mentioned non
participation in government as "the
most flagrant of abuses."
Commenting on the Stan/prd scene,
the president, complimented the stu
dent body on its self government, but
added that it was "not so good as to
be beyond improvement." Since
taking office, he said, he had ob
served two things:
1. That when Stanford students
come to grips with a problem and get
a firm grasp of the facts, "their ap-
I praising and judgment are good."
2. "The self-starting interest in

self-government is less than it might
be."
Candidates Introduced
The assembly was the main event
in a day set aside for arousing inter
est in tomorrow's ASSU final elec
tion. ASSU presidential and vice
presidential candidates were intro
duced by Ted Buttner. Elva Bricca,
assistant Election Board chairman,
introduced candidates for other of
fices.
