# Graduates and Student Government
## 
### 
Excom focused its attention on Stanford's
graduate population last Wednesday night and
came up with the decision to poll every gradu
ate student.
Purpose of the poll, which will be conducted
by mail and administered by the Excom polling
committee, is to determine what the grads want
in the way of student government.
Right now, according to many observers, the
farm's 2,800 graduates are not getting a fair
shake for their quarterly contribution of $3,500
to the ASSU coffers.
There are not enough all-graduate dances,
net enough all-graduate forums, and student
faculty relations on the graduate level need
improving, the observers tell us.
If the observers are right—and the poll re
sults bear them out —we'd like to see a graduate
excom formed to declare policy for the grads
<ind administer it.
To finance the venture, a part of the grads'
.'1)3,500 should be budgeted by Excom.

Student government on the ASSU level
would remain the same. The grads would still
send two representatives to Excom, while the
larger portion of graduate monies would re
main earmarked for such functions as Foreign
Scholarships, Rally Com, lIR, Honor Code, and
Election Board—ASSU functions which serve
graduates as well as undergraduates.
We are told that many eastern and mid
western schools do a better job of graduate in
tegration and planning than we do. Still, we
have always felt that those ASSU activities—
social and otherwise—that are open to under
graduates are by the same token open to
graduates.
On the other hand, if the grads tell us the
ASSU social slate is inadequate to meet their
needs, if they conclude that forums, bull-ses
sions, and student-faculty relations are not what
they should be within their individual schools,
then we are all for a grad Excom—or something
similar to it.
