## Benet Answers Critics of Interview 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems in poor taste to maintain such a contro
versy on a personal level, especially when the form of
expression resorts more to the insult than to the aca
demic reserve suitable here.
There has been a definite attempt to confuse anti-
Franco and anti-Spain. This lack of intellectual sin
cerity could be characteristic of the "freedom of ex
pression" which is supposed to reside in Spain today.
To deny anyone the right to speak of his country be
cause a five-year absence would render him unin
formed, is unfair; and—since, after leaving Spain in
1945, I returned once a year until after 1949—un
founded.
My critic seems to have purposely ignored the re
cent affairs in Catalonia under the pretext that this
region is not Spain in its entirety. It is true that
Catalonia does not adequately represent Spain as a
whole; but still it is a part of the whole—a very alive
part, as its recent strikes testify—and therefore not
to be eliminated from a discussion Spanish affairs.
The statement that professors in Spain cannot teach
without belonging to the Opus Dei is only a misin
terpretation of a newspaper interview in which I de
scribed this institution as having vows similar to those
of a religious order. The state could never require
membership in the Opus Dei. because the religious
character of the vows makes membership entirely a
personal matter. Therefore, although my critic is for
mally correct in saying that she and her colleagues
were not members, that is not to deny the tremendous
influence of the Opus Dei in the educational system of
Spain today, an influence impossible to attain without
the full support of the state.
That is also not to deny the suppression of aca
demic freedom in regard to views of the state or
church. The aim of the FUE was the liberation of
higher learning from this suppression.
Being on the side of the opposition, having to make
decisions which will deeply influence the rest of my
life, I have analyzed the situation most carefully and
asked myself more questions than would a contented
mind living the same page of history.
