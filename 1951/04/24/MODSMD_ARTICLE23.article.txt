# Tennis Story Missing
## 
### 
According to pre-season "dope" USC was supposed
to have one of the strongest college teams in the nation.
We had played them earlier this season and were de
feated, 8 to 1. Last Saturday we played a return match
and were nosed out, 5 to 4. with the last match deciding
the issue.
Results were given in San Francisco, San Jose, and
Palo Alto papers. There were more spectators present
than for many events to which The Daily has given a
considerable amount of publicity. Yet, I couldn't find
a thing about the matches in Monday's Daily.
I have been known for some time as one who is not
entirely satisfied with the athletic situation at Stanford
and have used the term "athletic situation" in a very
broad sense, to include non-athletic student attitude.
If Daily policy is to "play down" athletics, the repre
sentatives of the students, who in the final analysis
foot the bills for The Daily, should make an open
declaration of policy.
After all, athletics not alone pay their own way but
produce a surplus to boot and I have yet to hear any
advocate of a "Chicago plan" indicate where even
enough money for intramurals would come from if we
are to adopt their plans of "de-emphasis."
