# MacArthur Articles

To the Editor:
The disgusting display of sarcastic "wit" in regard
to the recent Mac Arthur articles in The Daily only
goes to show that few people can appreciate a forth
right and honest man, whether one agrees with his
opinions or not. Too bad that some of the great "in
tellects'' of Stanford, both students and faculty, can't
appreciate a really magnificent speech when they hear
one. It seems as if a sincere difference of opinion in
our "democracy" must be discouraged in favor of con
formity at all cost, and intelligence must give way to
politics.
Any hall-hearted attempt at a comparison between
the Truman speech of last week, and the Mac-Arthur
speech would show up the vast difference in the capa
bilities of these two men. And if it is true that the
President failed to hear Mac Arthur's address it is
really too bad. Mr. Truman missed a speech of mas
terful organization and dignity of presentation, com
pletely lacking the usual political rot! What a relief!
