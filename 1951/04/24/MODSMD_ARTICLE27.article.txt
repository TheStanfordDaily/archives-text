# Eighteenth-Century Music Rated 'A Delectable Treat'
## 
### 
A very delectable treat was pre
sented ut Cubberley Auditorium
Sunday afternoon when music pro
lessors Sandor Salgo and Putnam
Aldrich gave a recital ol' eighteenth
century music for violin and harp
sichord.
Much variety of musical style can
occur within a hundred years, and
the program took advantage of that
phenomenon.
The Baroque period was repre
sented by two contrasted pieces, the
Sonata in E Major for Violin and
Harpsichord of Bach, with its Ital
ianate coloratura and violinistic
melody, and a relatively unknown
Suite for Harpsichord by the
Frenchman Charles Dieupart — a
work of ornate, noble, and sprightly
dances.
There was a spokesman for the
Classic period too: Mozart's F Ma
jor Sonata for Violin and Harpsi
chord (or piano), attractive because
of its gallant tunefulness and com
pelling depth of lyric, harmonic ex
pression.
Sunday's performances were no
less pleasurable than the music it
self. Salgo played with his custom
ary expert intonation and articula
tion and his beautifully rounded
tone that is rich and yet not over
sweet.
He successfully carried off the not
easy feat of playing the Bach with
the bow held at some distance from
the end, thus producing sound ap
proximating that brought about by
use of the eighteenth-century short
bow. Such a technique served to
lesson the problem of balance that
occurs when a violin plays with the
small-toned harpsichord.
The tone of a harpsichord.may be
small, but there was nothing small
about the quality of Aldrich's han
dling of the instrument.
He brought to the harpsichord
parts a wealth of color and tasteful
embellishment made possible by his
long study of harpsichord music and
performance. His registrations pro
duced a notable textural clarity and
dynamic variety, and his ornamen
tation gave the lines their needed
life.—A. B.
