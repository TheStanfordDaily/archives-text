# April's Chappie: 'Best of the Rest'
## 
### 
You can lead from cover to cover
of the April Chaparral, and you
! won't find anything from the Old
Boy's pen except the editorial and
the ads.
Yes, tomorrow it's Exchange Issue
time again, when the Chappie picks
"the best of the rest" and presents
it to the Farm all in one glorious
issue.
This year the Old Boy's scissors
1 have clipped little gems from the
Yale Record, the Harvard Lampoon,
J and other college humor magazines
i from all over the country, including
| even the Cal Pelican. These "con
| tributions" include cartoons, stories,
! features, and the perennial stolen
1 jokes.
