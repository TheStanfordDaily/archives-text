# PRO AND CAHN
## 
### 
Having nothing better to do last Saturday afternoon we wandered out
to the varsity tennis courts. Hopes of getting a little sun overshadowed
a desire to see USC and Card netsters do battle.
Upon arrival, we were greatly surprised to see the North grandstand, the
only one, almost filled, in fact, a larger attendance than at many local base
hall affairs.
Now, not being completely absent of tennis knowledge or appreciation,
we sat back in the warm sun to enjoy a few matches. Our attention was cen
tered on the far court where George Gentry was matching forehands and
backhands with Earl Blackmore of the visiting Trojans. Gentry had taken
the first set, 6-4, on a judge's questionable line decision.
The second set was under way when we came upon the fierce struggle.
Th games stood even at five-all. Blackmore and Gentry had each won their
respective serves and that's the way it went until the games deadlocked at
seven apiece. The two opponents seemed as evenly matched as the finest
pair of gold cufflinks. Either Gentry or Blackmore needed a two-game mar
gin to cop the set. Gentry wanted to end the whole thing and the SCer
needed the set to force a climactic third and match-deciding set.
George Cracks Opponent's Service
But George would have none of it and broke through Blackmore's service,
and then proceeded to win his own service, the set, 9 to 7, and the match in
two straight sets.
Although the visitor from the Southland rushed the net in a congratula
tory move, all was not milk, honey, and sweetness during the hard-fought
battle. At one point Blackmore stopped the match in order to address a few
well-chosen words in direction of the judge, freshman tennis star, Jim
Cornish. Apparently Blackmore did not like the way Cornish was delaying
1 lis fault calls. In fact, he claimed that he hesitated long enough on some
calls to see whether or not Gentry could make a return.
Of course, Cornish was doing the best job he could, but the visitor was
entitled to a beef due to the bad call that possibly cost him the first set, and
may have caused sufficient mental anguish to cost him the second set;
enough said.
Court Oratory Amusing
Gentry himself, although a perfect court gentleman, expressed his emo
tions quite audibly several times, much to the amusement of the gallery.
Remarks of self-disgust filled the spring air. Such as "I'll be a son-of-a
gun," "Let's get off it,"and many more appropriate to the occasions that
arose. These, coupled with remarks of praise, "Excellent," "Nice shot,"
marked by just the right amount of disgust and sarcasm, directed at Black
more, kept the crowd in good spirits.
Evidently the spectators were well pleased and enthusiastic about the
tennis they were seeing, judging by the bursts of applause following a long
rally, good shots, or a spirited try. Gentry received a standing ovation upon
downing Blackmore.
Not the Uniform That Counts?
It's often said that it isn't the uniform that counts, but what's in it. The
USC squad had nice looking tennis togs. White sweaters with red trim, with
a fancy, red "Trojans" in script. The T-shirts were monogrammed with a
fancy, interwinding SC. Sure looked neat. Stanford showed no distinguish
ing marks at all. You say, "It isn't the uniform that counts?" Just look at the
final match outcomeâ€”USC 5, Stanford 4.
The sun was sure warm, though.
