SAN FRANCISCO. April 23 (UP)
-—The Pacific Coast League swings
into its filth week of competition
today with the tightest battle of re
cent years in the making for the
loop leadership.
Even the lowly San Francisco
Seals, who lost their first 13 games
of the season, have shown signs of
coming to life. They have won 10
out of their last 14 tilts and are only
six and one-half games out of first
place.
The topsy-turvy loop appears to

be about evenly balanced and the
leaders, Portland and San Diego,
took their bumps last week. They'll
try to recover in three-game series
opening tomorrow with the Beavers
entertaining the up - and - coming
Seals, and the Padres visiting third
place Los Angeles.
In the other series, Hollywood
goes to Seattle to take on a Rainier
club that just got through sweeping
a four-tilt series with Portland, and
the Sacramento Solons meet the
Acorns in Oakland.
