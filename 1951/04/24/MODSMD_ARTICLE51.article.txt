# Slugfest Predicted When Horsehiders Battle Powerful Gauchos Here Today
## 
### 
Santa Barbara State's visiting j
baseball team will play a weary I
Stanford nine here today at 3:15.
The Indians, who played three !
tough games in two days last week,
will be in no mood to play another j
24 to 10 marathon as they did the '
last time they met the Gauchos. !
After losing that one, a night game i
which featured home runs into the j
ocean, the Cards evened up these- !
ries the following day before going 1
on to meet USC in Los Angeles.
The visitors are led by slugging !
outfielders Corky Johnson and Bill
Cox, and they never fail to have at I
least one rhubarb when meeting the |
Cards.
For Stanford, Coach Everett Dean '
| will pitch Jim Claypool, Jack Alex- |
i ander, and Tony Stellar. As of late j
| his pitching staff has been like a j
water faucet—hot and cold. And in-
J stead of going to sleep by counting
sheep. Dean has been losing it by \
1 counting bases on balls given up by
his chuckers.
Although the Indians' CIBA rec
! ord at present is only 4 wins and 4
! losses, there is a strong possibility
j that the Santa Clara games will not
i count toward the PCC champion
[ ships, and they may not enter into
the NCAA - playoff choice for this
district. Should this be the case, the '
| Cards are still very much in the j
running as their PCC standing
would be 2 wins and 2 losses yith 1
eight games to go.


808 JOHNSON—The diminutive
Santa Barbara left -bander will
probably see plenty of action to
day when the Gauchos meet Stan
ford at 3:15 p.m. in the Sunken
Diamond.
