### 
Seventy - five sti dents in Stan-j
ford's Graduate School of Business '
are learning now what real life
teaches everyone—one sure way to j
get things done is to do it yourself. I
As a result, they've created a
mythical construction company to
direct the f)00 man-hours of labor
and the $5,000 budget for a new
lounge in the basement of the
school.
All work will be done by the stu
dents and money is being collected !
from the students and alumni. The j
students already have contributed
$1,000, and alumni have given an
additional $1,100.
"President" James Parker, sec- i
ond-ycar business student, reported j
the firm started planninc last year, j
einH three months ago "works su- j
perintendent" Don Rohde began as- j
signing student volunteers to the j
task.
The plan is to proceed with the
basic work. As the money becomes !
available for various refinements, I

these will be incorporated in the
project.
Plans call for a 50x30 area provid
ing 1,500 square feet, or about the
same area as a nice-sized three
bedroom house. Partitions will di
vide the area into conversation
groups. An interior garden motif
will be used in decorations, and an
outdoor patio where students can
cat lunch also is being planned.
