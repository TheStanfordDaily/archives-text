# FOR FARM VISITORS
## Student Guides Contribute To Stanford's Reputation 
### 
The high academic standing ,
of Stanford and the caliber of its
graduates are not alone respon-!
sible for Stanford's high reputa
tion.
A share of the responsibility ;
for this reputation rests securely
in the hands of Stanford's 15-
member Student Guide Service.
How this works is easily illus- i
trated.
A year ago, during a bankers' j
convention in San Francisco, a man
called the University and said eight J
bus loads of bankers would be here j
at noon to take a look at the cam- !
pus.
Into Action
The Student Guide Service swung j
into action, recruited some help
from Cardinals, and was on hand
when the bankers arrived.
The guides answered questions, !
directed a tour of the campus, and j
took the bankers to the particular
places they wanted to see.
Thus the Farm sent eight bus
loads of bankers back to the big city
with an excellent impression of
Stanford.
The guide service does the same j
thing all year long with never a day j
off. It is the front door to the Uni- >
versify, according to Publications j
Editor Walter C. Peterson, who is in |
charge of the servicc.
High school students, casual visi- I
tors, professional groups, .students
from other universities, and groups I
such as the Cub Scouts get their I
first impression of Stanford from
guide service tours, and it is the .job ;
of the guide service to make that
first impression a good one.
Head Guide
Joan Isham is head guide. Her
job is to schedule shifts for the ,
guides, make out the payroll, ar- j
range for special tours, and see that
the offices have the necessary sup- !
plies.
Other guides arc Hal Magarian, j
Nancy Venator, Marilyn LeHeuscn, j
Kay McKenna, Ann Jarrot, Pat
Jones. Johanna Bartky, Nancy Glid- 1
den, Don Williver, Claire Sprague, j
Rae Jean Kelly, Elise McKown, i
Marian Robinson, and Ruth Vories.
Each has guide work from six to
eight hours a week for 75 cents an
i
hour.
Spring and summer are the busy j
seasons for the guides, but in addi- |
tion to conducting an average of j
three tours a week throughout the j
year, the guides operate the two of
fices, an information booth in the j
cell, which is at the entrance to Me- I
morial Court, and in Hoover Li- I
brary, from where trips to the top
of the 285-foot tower are conducted, j
To Get to the Top
To go to the top of the tower, all ;
a person has to do is sign the book j
in the lobby of Hoover Library. Any
number will be conducted to the j
top between 1 and 5 on weekdays

and between 112) and 5 on Saturdays.
The tower is closed Sundays.
At their ccll office, the guides sell
post cards, information pamphlets,
books, maps, and other literature, |
and give information to one and all. !
Besides knowing where the near- ,
est rest room is, the guides must be j
up on conferences and other goings I
on about campus.
Hires the Guides
This information comes to the |
guides from the office of the Direc
tor of Information, which also hires i
the guides.
As qualifications for a guide, Pe- j
terson lists patience, ingenuity, a !
willingness to help, and the ability )
to smile.
The guides are not expected to be
walking encyclopedias, but they arc j
expected to know where to find the j
answers to the questions thrown at i
them.
But there is always someone to !
come along with a complete stumper j
like, "Where did Senator Lcland |
Stanford bury his race horses?"—

The high academic standing ,
of Stanford and the caliber of its
graduates are not alone respon-!
sible for Stanford's high reputa
tion.
A share of the responsibility ;
for this reputation rests securely
in the hands of Stanford's 15-
member Student Guide Service.
How this works is easily illus- i
trated.
A year ago, during a bankers' j
convention in San Francisco, a man
called the University and said eight J
bus loads of bankers would be here j
at noon to take a look at the cam- !
pus.
Into Action
The Student Guide Service swung j
into action, recruited some help
from Cardinals, and was on hand
when the bankers arrived.
The guides answered questions, !
directed a tour of the campus, and j
took the bankers to the particular
places they wanted to see.
Thus the Farm sent eight bus
loads of bankers back to the big city
with an excellent impression of
Stanford.
The guide service does the same j
thing all year long with never a day j
off. It is the front door to the Uni- >
versify, according to Publications j
Editor Walter C. Peterson, who is in |
charge of the servicc.
High school students, casual visi- I
tors, professional groups, .students
from other universities, and groups I
such as the Cub Scouts get their I
first impression of Stanford from
guide service tours, and it is the .job ;
of the guide service to make that
first impression a good one.

job is to schedule shifts for the ,
guides, make out the payroll, ar- j
range for special tours, and see that

Marian Robinson, and Ruth Vories.
Each has guide work from six to
eight hours a week for 75 cents an
i
hour.
Spring and summer are the busy j
seasons for the guides, but in addi- |
tion to conducting an average of j
three tours a week throughout the j
year, the guides operate the two of
fices, an information booth in the j
cell, which is at the entrance to Me- I
morial Court, and in Hoover Li- I
brary, from where trips to the top
of the 285-foot tower are conducted, j

At their ccll office, the guides sell
