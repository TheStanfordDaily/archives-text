# Warren Earns Rich Praise
## 
### DAVID MILSTEIN 
It is rather difficult to find un
hackneyed words for c escribing a
| truly impressive conccrt pcrform-
I ancc. Leonard Warren, for his mag
i nificent. singing in Memorial Hall
last night, merits all the usual cli
| chcs plus many more lines of praise.
Leading off with a group of four
lyric songs by Handel, Monteverdi,
and two Italians, Mr. Warren dis
| played a rich, deep voice of im
j men.se power and range. An appar
! ently effortless flow of alternately
peaceful and rollicking melodies
filled the farthest corners of the
hall.
Nor was # the Warren sonority
marred by any excessive histrionics,
gestures, vibrations, or bellows as
with so many baritones.
A second group of ecstatic love
songs in olden style was followed by
| selections from operas for which
Mr. Warren is justifiably famous. A
rollicking "Toreador Sonq" was
charming, even if not much lik?
Bizet, and the later "Prologue to
PagliHcci" provided a thrilling high
point of the evening.
The program was concluded with
a number of lilting, humorous, mod
ern songs and several similarly
lusty encores, of which "Old Mother
Hubbard" (a parody on Bach and
opera) was especially notable.
The most striking feature of Mr.
Warren's stage manner is his great
sincerity and obvious joy in singing.
This verve made him excel in the
more loving and joyful songs, and
was powerful enough to make one
I minimize the occasional distressing
rasps in an otherwise smooth per
formance.
