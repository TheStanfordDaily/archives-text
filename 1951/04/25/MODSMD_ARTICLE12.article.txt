# Dangers of Inflation Described by Kreps
## 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
Dr. Theodore Kreps last night led
a Tuesday Evening Series crowd of
about 200 persons behind the scenes
in China and showed how inflation
contributed to the downfall of the
Kuomintang and insured the success
of the Communists.
Dr. Kreps, professor of business
economics in the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, speaking in Mem
Aud on "Some Hazards of an Infla
tionary Defense Economy." discussed
three of the hazards, the danger of a
ger of injuring the long-run military
garrison state, inflation, and the dan
efTectiveness of our human resources.
"Wherever Communism has gained
a foothold," Dr. Kreps said, "the way
was prepared by inflation."
He labeled the present congres
sional policy of "inactivity" and "wait
and see" as contributing to inflation
and added "inflation is decreasing
production" at a time when we need
more production.
To combat inflation, Dr. Kreps rec
ommended increased taxation, par

ticularly in the $4,000 to $15,000 in
come group; government economy;
and an overhaul of the military |
budget.
He said the military budget should j
be tailored to fit expected govern- S
mental receipts and added that in- i
stead of deficit spending, "the treas
ury should be running with a surplus
of about $7 billion annually," to curb j
inflation.
