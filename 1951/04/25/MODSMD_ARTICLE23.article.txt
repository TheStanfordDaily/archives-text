# Business Still Wants College Grads
## 
### 
One year ago, employment opportunities
were scarce and Stanford seniors, viewing job
hunting with some dismay, flocked to the
Placement Service where they sought, and
found, employers willing to hire them. Then
came the Korean War, which brought along
with the draft, an ever-increasing demand for
the largest labor force in the nation's history.
Yet paradoxically enough, this year's seniors
seem reluctant to make any effort to get jobs
for themselves.
This apathy toward acquiring employment is
in evidence at the Placement Service, which re
ports a definite decline in the number of sen
iors, particularly those with general education,
registering for employment interviews.
It is quite possible that this lack of interest
on the part of students is a result of the pres
ent draft situation. The too-prevalent attitude
is, "Why should I go out and try to get a job
when I may be drafted at any time, and no
body would want to hire a prospective draftee
anyway?"
But students are neglecting several basic
facts. For one thing, the employers are just as
confused as the students on the matter of who's
going to get drafted and when. The employer
cannot sit around not hiring anybody, since his
business must go on, and his business needs
capable help. Consequently, firms throughout
the country are attempting to employ the gradu
ates they need, and are willing to risk their

being called into service.
Second, even if the student is drafted before
he has earned his first paycheck, a company is
often happy merely to have the employee iden
tified with the firm, having found from World
War II experiences that the employee is more
likely to return after the war.
From the student's point of view, if he is
drafted he will probably welcome the knowl
edge that he has a job waiting for him when
he gets out, at a time when hundreds of thou
sands of other veterans may flood the labor
market. Again, if he has registered in the Place
ment Service, he can count, on that office's as
sistance in acquiring a position. Few students
realize that more than half of the Service's ac
tive registrants are graduates.
As to those men who hesitate to apply for
jobs in non-essential industries in hopes ot
landing a position in a deferable and essential
business, we point out that whether or not a
man may be dratted out of an "essential" in
dustry is as much at the discretion of the local
draft board as college deferment.
We suggest that senior men take advantage
of the fine opportunities offered them now by
the Placement Service and the present labor
demand. And a good way to begin is by attend
ing the last program of the Senior Vocom to
night when professional businessmen outline
today's situation in business and government
positions. -—8.8.

jobs in non-essential industries in hopes ot
landing a position in a deferable and essential
business, we point out that whether or not a
man may be dratted out of an "essential" in
dustry is as much at the discretion of the local
draft board as college deferment.
We suggest that senior men take advantage
of the fine opportunities offered them now by
the Placement Service and the present labor
demand. And a good way to begin is by attend
ing the last program of the Senior Vocom to
night when professional businessmen outline
today's situation in business and government

One year ago, employment opportunities
were scarce and Stanford seniors, viewing job
hunting with some dismay, flocked to the
Placement Service where they sought, and
found, employers willing to hire them. Then
came the Korean War, which brought along
with the draft, an ever-increasing demand for
the largest labor force in the nation's history.
Yet paradoxically enough, this year's seniors
seem reluctant to make any effort to get jobs
for themselves.
This apathy toward acquiring employment is
in evidence at the Placement Service, which re
ports a definite decline in the number of sen
iors, particularly those with general education,
registering for employment interviews.
It is quite possible that this lack of interest
on the part of students is a result of the pres
ent draft situation. The too-prevalent attitude
is, "Why should I go out and try to get a job
when I may be drafted at any time, and no
body would want to hire a prospective draftee
anyway?"
But students are neglecting several basic
facts. For one thing, the employers are just as
confused as the students on the matter of who's
going to get drafted and when. The employer
cannot sit around not hiring anybody, since his
business must go on, and his business needs
capable help. Consequently, firms throughout
the country are attempting to employ the gradu
ates they need, and are willing to risk their

being called into service.
Second, even if the student is drafted before
he has earned his first paycheck, a company is
often happy merely to have the employee iden
tified with the firm, having found from World
War II experiences that the employee is more
likely to return after the war.
From the student's point of view, if he is
drafted he will probably welcome the knowl
edge that he has a job waiting for him when
he gets out, at a time when hundreds of thou
sands of other veterans may flood the labor
market. Again, if he has registered in the Place
ment Service, he can count, on that office's as
sistance in acquiring a position. Few students
realize that more than half of the Service's ac
tive registrants are graduates.
