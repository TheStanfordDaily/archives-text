# Vote 'Yes' on Amendments
## 
### 
We're asking you to vote "yes" today on the
two constitutional amendments proposed by
Excom relating to the elimination of winter
quarter elections. Here are our reasons:
1. If passed, the amendments will save AS
SU up to $75 per year—or the approximate cost
of running a single election for Men's and
Women's Councils.
2. If passed, the amendments are very likely
to insure a greater percentage of votes for the
Councils. Last quarter, operating under the
winter quarter election setup, barely 20 per cent
of the student body found time to cast ballots.
3. If passed, the amendments will make it
easier for you. Instead of voting three times a
year for ASSU offices, you will vote only twice:
once in the fall, once in the spring. Passage of
the amendments will mean less student apathy
all around.

Excom has spent no small amount of time in
vestigating the faulty winter quarter election
setup. For more than a month now, represen
tatives have conferred with Election Board and
Men's and Women's Councils. Both bodies are
in favor of the changes proposed.
Representation on the Councils will remain
virtually unaltered should the amendments
pass. There will still be five members on each
Council, the only difference being that the
junior incumbents on each council (elected fall
quarter) will serve two quarters of their junior
year and one quarter of their senior year, in
stead of the present one quarter as juniors and
two quarters as seniors.
The amendments are a good idea. They've
taken a good deal of time to work out to the
satisfaction of the principals involved. Vote for
their adoption!
