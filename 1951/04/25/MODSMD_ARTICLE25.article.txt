## Benet Advice Is III Advised 
### 
To (he Editor:
In the first four months after the victory of the Rus
;■ ian-inspired Popular Front in Spain in the elections
of February 1936, there were 113 general and 218 par
tial strikes, successful firing of 170 churches, 69 clubs,
and 10 newspaper offices; and attempts to burn 284
other buildings, 251 of which were churches.
In July 1936, Calvo Sotelo, leader of the opposition,
delivered a speech in the Spanish Parliament, to which
Dolores Ibarurri, one of the leaders of the Communist
Party, answered, telling him he would be murdered.
On July 13, government police seized Calvo Sotelo at
his home, shot him in the head and threw the corpse
on a road.
Thus began the last Spanish Civil War. In it,
thousands of priests and tens of thousands of lay
peuple were murdered by the so-called Republicans,
following the well-known Ruvsian pattern. The
bloody foundations of the actual Spanish political
situation are, therefore, much deeper than Mr.
Clark's letter suggests. The blood-stained hands,
however, are rather on the other side.
There are 55,111 schools in Spain (8,000 of them built
under the actual administration), 119 high schools, 12
universities, 65 technical and engineering schools, 120
industrial arts schools, 29 art schools, and some others.
Maybe 0.01 per cent of the professors and teachers are
Opus Dei members. Mr. Benet is wrong. There Is.
however, nothing wrong with the Opus Dei; its mem
bers are outstanding in their specific jobs.
Black market is an offspring of scarcity, not of cor
ruption. Spain is not rich, but the actual administra
tion has built more decent houses for workers than all
the preceding Spanish governments together.
Would the exiled Spanish politicians be willing to
restore to Spain the national treasure (one of the
liiggest of the world, in gold ingots) that they so

carefully retrieved when leaving Spain, the stand
ard of life could be higher still.
I would like to know from Mr. Scheer what are the
views of the Spaniards of the lower classes? Maybe
Miss Gonzalez was not much in contact with the com
mon people (a very difficult achievement!).
Power generation in Spain has more than doubled
in the last 10 years.. Irvl;«strial consumption, how
ever, has increased faster. There is no more govern
ment corruption in Spain than in the most demo
cratic countries, and, of course, infinitely less than
under the Spanish Republican regime.
The standard of living in Spain has not been re
duced below subsistence. Actually, it is higher (for
the average worker, Mr. Clark, not only for the few
rich) than in most Western European countries (not
to speak of behind the iron curtain).
The workers are not compelled to unionize, as is the
case in other countries. They enjoy, however, more
labor rights than in many other countries. There is
no open opposition to Franco; and there are many for
eign interests waiting for the dark forces of revolu
tion to succeed in imposing their own minority will,
as they did once.
The FUE was, in its latest times, a gangster-type
organization of students, directed from Russia.
Mr. Benet's statements about Spain are for the most
part erroneous, but they may prove useful to himself.
There are a lot of people eager to swallow the type of
misinformation he obligingly serves to them. Such
tactics often pay dividends. His fatherly advice to
the American people and government in regard to
their policies about Spain is per haps too ambitious for
such an inexperienced young man. We hope that
people honestly interested in Spanish affairs will find
better sources of information. There is no space in the
Daily "letters' to correct all the distortions other
people can create. MANUEL GOLMAYO
