## 'Rocking Horse' Padded, Uneven 
### ROY HEMMING GEORGE BUCKLEY 
An unusual short-story by D. H. Lawrence provides the frame
work for the current J. Arthur Rank entry at the Guild—"The Rock
ing Horse Winner."
The story is about a boy who develops a mystical relationship
with a wooden rocking-horse that tells him the winners in real

J races.
The boy's phenomenal winnings
are kept secret from his family, yet
' used to help his mother satisfy an
overpowering money madness—until
tragedy results for all concerned.
As a single episode in a movie such
as "Quartet" or "Trio." the Law-
I rence story might have been out
j standing as both entertainment and
as a moral lesson.
But padded as it is in the cur
rent production, it moves along
brilliantly in some parts—then hits
dull stretches upon dull stretches.
Then too, the essential callousness
and morbidity of the treatment he
comes a little overbearing after the
first 45 minutes.
Another significant weakness in the
picture is the actor who plays the
boy. Physically he looks much too
big and too old to be going around
I playing with a rocking horse in the
first place.
On the other hand. Valerie Ilobson
has some very fine scenes as the
mother—especially in her arguments
about money with her weak husband.
John Mills is good as an ex-jockey,
and Hugh Sinclair does the best he
can with the poorly written role of
the father.
While a number of San Fran
cisco theaters have shown a whole
string of line foreign-language
films in recent months—certainly in
the Guild's quality tradition—the
Menlo theater has varied often be
! tween second-rate J. Arthur Rank
and second runs.
On Thursday, for example, the
Guild is bringing back Bergman's
mediocre "Joan of Arc," followed the
next week by Italy's "Bitter Rice"—
which has already played in Palo
Alto.
With such films as the 1950 Acad
| emy winner, "Walls of Malapaga,"
Julien Duvivier's splendid "The Sin
ners, Jean Kenoir's classic satire,
"La Regie du Jeu," or the postwar
! German comedy, "Film Without a
Name," all showing in S.F. but not
in Menlo. we can't help but feel dis
! appointed by the current trend.

An unusual short-story by D. H. Lawrence provides the frame
work for the current J. Arthur Rank entry at the Guild—"The Rock
ing Horse Winner."
The story is about a boy who develops a mystical relationship
with a wooden rocking-horse that tells him the winners in real

J races.
The boy's phenomenal winnings
are kept secret from his family, yet
' used to help his mother satisfy an
overpowering money madness—until
tragedy results for all concerned.
As a single episode in a movie such
as "Quartet" or "Trio." the Law-
I rence story might have been out
j standing as both entertainment and
as a moral lesson.
But padded as it is in the cur
rent production, it moves along
brilliantly in some parts—then hits
dull stretches upon dull stretches.
Then too, the essential callousness
and morbidity of the treatment he
comes a little overbearing after the
first 45 minutes.
Another significant weakness in the
picture is the actor who plays the
boy. Physically he looks much too
big and too old to be going around
I playing with a rocking horse in the
first place.
On the other hand. Valerie Ilobson
has some very fine scenes as the
mother—especially in her arguments
about money with her weak husband.
John Mills is good as an ex-jockey,
and Hugh Sinclair does the best he
can with the poorly written role of
the father.
While a number of San Fran
cisco theaters have shown a whole
string of line foreign-language
films in recent months—certainly in
the Guild's quality tradition—the
Menlo theater has varied often be

and second runs.
On Thursday, for example, the
Guild is bringing back Bergman's
mediocre "Joan of Arc," followed the
next week by Italy's "Bitter Rice"—
which has already played in Palo
Alto.
