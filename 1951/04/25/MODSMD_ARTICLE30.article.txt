# USMC Seeks More Roughs

Stanford's quota of men taking
summer training with the Marine
Corps Platoon Leaders' Class has
been raised from 30 to 50 "and can
go even higher," Lt. Col. Clifford F.
Quilici, associate professor of naval
science, announced yesterday.
Quilici said some G5 have already
tfied out for the class, which ex
tends over two summers, but that
"at least half of them will fail their
physicals."
This means that at least 20 addi
tional openings are now available to
men of freshman, sophomore, or
junior standing, he said.
Quilici urged all those interested
in the program (which requires no
previous military experience and
provides 1-D draft classification) to
see him in the Men's Physical Edu
cation Building.
He said examining doctors will be
on campus next week to give candi
dates their physicals.
Among other requirements, can
didates must have 20-20 vision, un
corrected.
Following two summers with the
Marines and graduation from col
lege, students in the program re
ceive reserve commissions as sec
ond lieutenants.
