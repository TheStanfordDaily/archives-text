# SC Track Juggernaut to Invade Stanford With Enviable Record
## 
### 
A "loaded" USC track team,
defending national champions,
and a perennial power in the
cinder world, v/ill come to Stan
ford Stadium this Saturday to do
battle with Jack Weiershauser's
tottering spikemen.
At present the Troymen are
working on a series of 40 straight
dual meets without defeat. They
were tied by Michigan State in 1949.
More .than that, the southlanders
have a tremendous heritage of track
and field laurels. SC has lost only
three meets to college competition
.since 1930. THE LAST TIME STAN
FORD BEAT 'I HEM WAS 1933.
More still. Under the coaching of
Dean Cromwell and Jess Hill the
Trojans have won the last 10 PCC
championships. Better yet, they
have won the national title 14 times
since 192G, including a string of nine
.straight between 1935 and 1943.
And still more. The Trojans have
accounted for 39 NCAA titles, 10
Olympic crowns, and 19 world rec
ords—all of which proves absolutely
nothing about Saturday's contest
except that those sportsmen who
want to see a good show should be
on hand when the first field events
yet under way at 1:30.
The Indians could put in only a
moderate {workout yesterday be
cause of the rain.


STAR SOPH SHOTPUTTER-SC's Parry O'Brien, who put the
16-pound blob 55 feet 4 l A> inches last weekend against Illinois
and Michigan State, will tangle with the Indians' Lew Davis in a
feature event of this Saturday's encounter with the Trojan horde.
