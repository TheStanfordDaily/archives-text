### BY "DIGGER" ODELL 
Already people are asking about Stanford's chances on the grid this fall. 1
And it's an impossible question to answer. We lost 13 good men from the
1950 squad, we've got a new set of coaches, the Army is stepping in where
professional scouts fear to tread, and anything can happen.
However, forgetting the other PCC schools for a moment and looking at
our gains and losses columns and our coaching staff, the 1951 squad looks
like a good, well-balanced football team. No telling now, but we might even
have a few stars besides McColl.
In the end department, three men have played their last game for the
Indiansâ€”Bruce Van Alstyne, Don Enberg, and Bob Scott. Van Alstyne,
in particular, will be a sad loss lor the Cards. Last season, but for Mc-
Coll, he would easily have been the outstanding Stanford gridder. Those
who saw him in the Big Game, and those who didn't, will agree that he
was of incalculable assistance in the 7 to 7 tie.
For the coming season, however, Chuck Taylor may have found an
able replacement in Sam Morley, up from the frosh. If Morley can learn
to block and does not tie up in battle, the Cards won't suffer in this de
partment.
At defensive end, the Farm will see the return of Jack Rye, who was out :
of order last season recuperating from a broken leg suffered in th 1949 Big 1
Game. Rye will make a good mate for Marv Tennel'oss, who suddenly
sprouted into a lion of defense last season. It was a beautiful sight to watch
Tennefoss dump many an opposing back for a loss.
The Indians have been hard hit at the tackle post. The loss of Russ Pome
roy, Gordy White. Wes Poulson, Ted Taylor, and Dick Gaedtke will be felt.
However, the likes of John Broderick. Leon King, Jim Vick, Len Kaprclian,
and Dick Gant may go a long ways toward patching up the hole.
Stanford's grid team has suffered no losses at the guard spot, but this has I
been a weak hole, anyway, as far as depth is concerned. Jesse Cone, Norm
Manoogian, Owen Powell, and Dick Lucas did a good job last season, but
there it ended. Taylor has been doing a lot of shifting in this department
lately, and it may be strengthened considerably.
From the looks of things now, the Cards' center post will be amply stocked
with Don Tobin. Dick Steere, and Doug Thamer on offense. Tsar Calfee and
Ted Tanner on defense at the middle linebacker post will do a good job, but
depth here is a question mark.
At quarterback the Indians lost a good man in Tom Shaw, who did some
great relief jobs last season, but the return of Jack Bickel, after a season's
layoff, and Bob Garrett, up from the frosh, along with Gary Kerkorian and
Dick Horn may find this department well taken care of. All of these boys
have been looking good in practice.
Stanford will miss the services of Bob White, Boyd Benson, and Dick
Broome at halfback next fall, but here again the Cards are loaded with po
tentials. Whether they will end up on offense or defense is a question, but
Harry llugasian. Joe St. Geme. Bob Bryan, Bob Hoegh, Dave Eldredge. and
Bill Scheidecker will provide a lot of power for the 1951 machine.
In the fullback department there have been no losses and with some shift
ing it will be well taken care of by Skip Crist, Doug Pinto, Chuck Essegian,
and Bob Meyers. Who will get the first nod the first game remains to be seen.
There you have it. You pays your money and you takes your choice.
