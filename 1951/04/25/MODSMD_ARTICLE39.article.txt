## Rain Fails To Halt Practice 
### 
Ruin tried and failed yesterday
afternoon to interrupt spring foot
ball practice. Coach Chuck Taylor's
schedule did not include rain, so
the gridaers ran through their af
ternoon dose of sciimmage despite
it all.
Passing was worked on again, and
a number of up-the-middle running
plays were thrown in to develop
power and to keep the defensive
squads on their toes.
Next Saturday morning's scrim
mage will be the most concen
trated held thus far in this spring
practice. For the workout, which
will be held under as near
conditions as will be used this
spring, the squad has been divided
into two complete teams, com
prising a defensive and an offen
sive unit each.
In the passing practice thus far,
Taylor has been continually pleased
with the catching ability shown by
end Sam Morley, up from the frosh.
However, line coach Joe Ruetz
adds that "while Morley is a real
ball hawk, he is going to have to
learn to block."
The prolonged scrimmage sessions
have produced a rash of injuries.
As of last night the official injury
list numbered 21 men, with wounds
ranging' from fingers to knees.
However, team physician Stanley
Lourdeaux considers three of a
more serious nature. Leading this
list is halfback Eric Southwood,
who is suffering from the same
pulled leg muscle which bothered
him all last season.
Paul Berger, up from the frosh,
and Leroy Fairman, JV halfback
last year, are both suffering from
bad knees.
