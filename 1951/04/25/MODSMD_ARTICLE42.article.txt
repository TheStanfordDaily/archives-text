ber nation. When questions of the
Far East command, the use of Na
! tionalist troops, or the admission of

j country.

Greetings from Taft
t Congratulations and advice on the
; conference have arrived at the lIR
j this week from as far as Rangoon,
I Burma. Senator Robert A. Taft (R..

Ohio) wrote his belief in the edu- ;
cational value of the model UN and j
added: , . j
"I enclose the spcech I made on '
the United Nations Charter when it |
was adopted by the Senate. Unfor- \
tunately, the warnings I Rave there
as to the defects of the Charter have i
been proved correct more rapidly ;
than I would have expected. It |
seems to me your conference should
develop the amendments which
should be adopted in order to meet
these defects."
Chan Cables
David Chan, former lIR president,
cabled that "the peoples of Asia
look forward to a strengthened UN
its the only possible means of estab
lishing a just peace. It is heartening

ganization. May you have increas
ing success in accelerating this mor
al force upon which our future as
fellow men depends."
