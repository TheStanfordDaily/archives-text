To insure that expenditures of the ,
ASSU will benefit more of the stu
dent body and to giva jfou d \ycll
co-ordinated but decentralized ac
tivity program, I propo.se:
(1) To offer greater participation
of smaller organizations in campus i
activities by means of co-spOnsored
events; (2) to initiate an a L^'vc
ASSU bulletin of various organiza
tion programs and personnel needs:
(:i) to effect this co-ordination by
frequent personal consultation with
committee heads.
