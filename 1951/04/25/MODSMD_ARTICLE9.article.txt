# Blood Donors Sought Today
## 
### 
No appointment will be necessary
to give blood today!
In response to a special emer
gency appeal from the United States
armed services, the Red Cross
bloodinobile visiting Stanford today
will handle as many blood donors
as possible.
It is thought that the special ap
peal comes as a direct result of the
big spring offensive which the Reds
launched Sunday in Korea.
Type "O" blood is wanted par
ticularly because, as the universal
donor type, it can be flown to the
front and used immediately in its
whole form. Besides this, it can be
administered to patients of any
blood type.
An individual donation requires
only 45 minutes, and blood may be
civen at, any time throughout the
day between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Although enough people have
signed up to give 200 pints of blood,
â€¢he bloodmobile has collected over
300 pints for one day in Palo Alto,
and it is hoped that enough extra
persons will volunteer today to uti
lize the unit to its maximum ca
pacity.
Due to the urgency of the appeal,
most extra donations will have to
come from students over 21. This is
because minors will not be allowed
to give blood unless they have re
lease slips signed by their parents,
and most Farm students who have
obtained these releases have already
made appointments to donate blood,
A new release slip must, be pre
sented for each donation.
Donors should eat nothing for
four hours previous to their dona
tion. They may drink coffee with
out cream or fruit juices, however.
No one who has had either a ty
phoid or a tetanus shot, within the
past two weeks may t*ive blood
either.
Those who cave blood in January
are able to donate again, and it is
hoped that everyone capable of giv
ing blood today wiil make the nec
essary effort.
