# For Better Sponsors
## 
### 
Right now, the sponsor-choosing committee
is al work selecting women to sponsor fresh
men and transfers next fall and summer. Yet,
even while they screen some 125 applicants for
the 40 sponsor positions, plans are being made
to give the girls chosen improved training for
thei/ jobs.
Those in charge of the sponsor program have
long felt that the girls had too much to learn in
the few short days allotted them before the
freshmen arrive. The sponsors themselves
complained of feeling unprepared to give
needed advice and guidance.
Their solution is the weekend retreat for new
sponsors to be held at the Hidden Villa, a youth
hostel in Los Altos, on May 11-13.
The training during this weekend will be of
the most basic type, to give the girls a strong
general background for sponsoring and a pic
ture of all aspects of University life.
Allowing Friday as a time for the new spon
sors to get acquainted with each other, the of
ficial program will open on Saturday morning
with a letter from President Wallace Sterling.
The rest of that day and Sunday the girls will
hear talks and take part in discussions with
representatives from the Public Relations Of

fice, the Administration, the dormitories, and
student government.
In line with the pre-reg committee's decision
to emphasize the academic side of college life
more, and the social side less during pre-reg
days, the sponsors will also meet with a panel
of Lower Division advisors.
The present sponsor committee is expend
ing a great deal of time and effort so that next
year's freshmen may be better oriented into
Stanford life. They are taking a constructive
step toward strengthening the much-criti
cized Lower Division advising set-up, by es
tablishing closer contact between sponsors
and advisors.
What's more, they are doing all this without
funds from the ASSU. Each girl will pay most
of her own expenses on the weekend. Simple
accommodations and community cooking will
be the rule.
These girls believe that the sponsor program
for freshman women is one of Stanford's out
standing features. They believe that the qual
ity of this program affects every activity on
campus, as the freshmen move into these ac
tivities.
They are backing this belief with hard work
and even financial support. We think they de
serve a lot of credit. —C.H.

to give the girls chosen improved training for
thei/ jobs.
Those in charge of the sponsor program have
long felt that the girls had too much to learn in
the few short days allotted them before the
freshmen arrive. The sponsors themselves
complained of feeling unprepared to give
needed advice and guidance.
Their solution is the weekend retreat for new
sponsors to be held at the Hidden Villa, a youth
hostel in Los Altos, on May 11-13.
The training during this weekend will be of
the most basic type, to give the girls a strong
general background for sponsoring and a pic
ture of all aspects of University life.
Allowing Friday as a time for the new spon
sors to get acquainted with each other, the of
ficial program will open on Saturday morning
with a letter from President Wallace Sterling.
The rest of that day and Sunday the girls will
hear talks and take part in discussions with
representatives from the Public Relations Of

fice, the Administration, the dormitories, and
student government.
In line with the pre-reg committee's decision
to emphasize the academic side of college life
more, and the social side less during pre-reg
days, the sponsors will also meet with a panel
of Lower Division advisors.
The present sponsor committee is expend
ing a great deal of time and effort so that next
year's freshmen may be better oriented into
Stanford life. They are taking a constructive
step toward strengthening the much-criti
cized Lower Division advising set-up, by es
tablishing closer contact between sponsors
and advisors.
What's more, they are doing all this without
funds from the ASSU. Each girl will pay most
of her own expenses on the weekend. Simple
accommodations and community cooking will
be the rule.
These girls believe that the sponsor program
for freshman women is one of Stanford's out
standing features. They believe that the qual
ity of this program affects every activity on
campus, as the freshmen move into these ac
tivities.
They are backing this belief with hard work
and even financial support. We think they de
serve a lot of credit. —C.H.
