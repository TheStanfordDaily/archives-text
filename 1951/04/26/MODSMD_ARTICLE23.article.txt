# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
I was walking down the Quad yesterday, trying to
figure out if Susana Maria Gonzalez Rubio and Mar
vin O. Adams meant anything spelled backwards,
when suddenly a thought struck me.
The world had yet to learn about some of the fabu-

lous miehief that went on in En
cina last year. Horrors, this can't
last. There are too many choice
items for non-'53 residents to wal
luw in ignorance. So I ran to my
special typewriter (my typewriter
is special, because some pens can
write under water, but my type
writer can write Underwood) and
:-:et down the whole unvarnished
story. Now it can be revealed:
SUICIDE SCARE:
A boy up on the fifth floor, who

we'll call Terry, removed the radiator cap or some
such appliance, and his room immediately filled up
with steam. Terry thought he would rest his head on
his desk and relax, as the room was now assuming
the proportions of a Turkish bath. Fine. But another
fifth-floor resident thought he would play a trick on
Terry, so he lifted the phone and contacted Mrs. Sum
ner, Resident Director of Encina and a top-notch
woman to boot. His frantic story was that someone
was committing suicide on the fifth floor.
The first one to respond to this message was the
lcthargic Toyon operator, and for the Toyon operator
to respond to anything is a rarity in itself. The op
erator whipped from Toyon to Encina, scurried up
the five llights of stairs, and burst into the room.
Next came a group of sponsors and Mrs. Sumner.
Imagine the scene that confronted their eyes: Here
was a steam-rilled room with a figure slumped over
the desk. To the astonishment of everyone, the reclin

ing figure came to life. Terry, as surprised as the rest,
remarked, "Hey, what the hell is going on around
here ?"
By this time, he wished he had committed suicide,
for he was receiving a verbal going-over from the re
ception committee. Not only that but the steam was
removing the pictures from the walls and the pleats
from the trousers.
LOCKED-UP COP
Much of the deviltry committed in Encina last year
was focused on the haughty cop who was the night
watchman in the hall. This cop, who imagined himself
Dick Tracy or someone, had a talent for making him
self unpopular.
Some of the Encinaites thought that one reason for
Dick's unfriendly attitude was that he didn't feel at
home without a jail nearby. Consequently, they de
cided to make one in Encina so Dick wouldn't feel
too ill-at-ease. Now a jail isn't of any value without
a prisoner, reasoned the Encina men; and just to
show that they were jolly good sports, they decided
to let Dick be their first.
The trap was baited by one of them who ran clown
to the lounge yelling, "Hey, there's a big water fight
in the 2E head." The cop, hearing this, scrambled up
to the third Hoor in order to sneak in behind the 2E
head.
In the meantime, some of the jailkeepers had re
moved the door handle from the inside of the bath
room and had put a lock on the outside. When the
cop rushed in, all ready to pounce on the imaginary
water-baggers, snap went the lock. Dick's pounding
on the door attracted about 100 students and assorted
well-wishers. It was quite a while until he was res
cued.
Doubtless, Dick forgot his two-way wrist radio.
