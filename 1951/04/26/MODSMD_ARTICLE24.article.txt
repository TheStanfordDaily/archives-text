How do the Russians look at
current world questions? The
answers can be found by spend- ;
ing 15 minutes in the upstairs
lobby of the main libe any day
between now and the first week
in May. There you will see
George Velliotes' current dis- i
play of Russian propaganda.
Chairman of the Russian delega- j
lion to the Model UN Assembly, j
grad student Velliotes calls his dis- !
j,l;.y "probably one oi the largest <
exhibits of Soviet Communist anti- 1
American visual propaagnda ever [
laged in the United States."
Including cartoons, photographs,
and articles from Pravda (truth), <
l/vestia (news), and other Rus
sian publications, the exhibit af
fords insight into official Soviet
policy toward Korea, China. For
mosa. Japan, the United Slates,
the UN, and various European
areas.
Velliotes, who began his study of '
Soviet propaganda two and one-halt |
years ago, sayji he is interested in I
"••ducating the public against the '
pread of Communism."
A part-time radio enthusiast who
co-ordinates the weekly lIR radio
program, "Stanford Scenes," over
KEEN every Sunday at 10:30 a.m..
Velliotes .says he may some day use
Ms propaganda collection as mate
rial for an M.A. or - Ph.D. thesis.
In addition to talilc displays, the
collector lias devoted much time I
to traveling around the country |
giving slide lectures about Soviet '
propaganda.
Sunday he will interview three
•indent-delegates to the Model UN
A sernbly over "Stanford Sceens."
The students are from Stanford, San
Jose State, and Santa Clara.

DIFFERENT KIND OF CARTOON—Yep, this sarcastic gem is
taken from Pravda, official Russian newspaper published in
Moscow. It depicts General Mac Arthur using Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshida as a "bloodhound." The book under Mac's
arm is entitled (in Russian, of course) "Register of Progressive
(Red) Elements," while the cartoon's caption reads "THE MAS
TER AND HIS BLOODHOUND."
