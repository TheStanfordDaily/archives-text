# 'The Shoemaker's Wife' Will Begin Run May 2
## 
### 
Federico Garcia Lorca, author of
"The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife,"
to be presented next weekend in the
Little Theater, was described by a
woman who met him personally as
"the outstanding young poet in
Spain."
Mrs. Lygia Callejo, who resides in
College Terrace, met Lorca when he
was in Cuba in 1930. He had already
achieved recognition as a poet, musi
cian, and playwright.
Tickets on Sale
"The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife"
is being presented by the Stanford
Players May 2, 3, 4, and 5. Tickets
for the production are on sale at the
Memorial Hall Box Office for GO cents.
Mrs. Callejo attested that Lorca
was prominent in the conflict be
tween the republicans and Franco
ists in Spain. Lorca in his writings
showed himself a strong Republican.
He also worked with a Federal tour
ing theater in Spain.
Cause of Death
It was Lorca's political views that
caused his death. He was shot in
1936 by the Falangists, the Franco
party. At the time, the writer was at
a friend's house in his home town of
Granada. He was taken from the
house, carried to a deserted road,
shot, and left there.
Much of Lorca's work was about
the folk-lore of the provinces of
Spain. He gave lectures throughout
Spain, categorizing the songs of
Spain.
Though a modern author, many of
his plays were based on folklore.
"The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife"
is an adaptation of the theme of the
old husband and the new wife, but
Lorca has added a surprise ending to
his tale.
