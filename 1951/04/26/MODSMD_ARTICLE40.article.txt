# Bryan Will Face USC
## Ailing Cindermen Return; Reed Out 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
The Curd track team's stock for
Saturday's cinderfeast with USC
soared yesterday when Coach Jack
Weiershauser announced that hur
dler Bob Bryan and broad jumper
Merritt Van Sant will see action.
However. Van Sant is still troubled
with a pulled muscle and may take
only one or two jumps.
The loss of these and several oth
er performers has crippled the In
dian attack for the last few weeks.
Along with the announcement of
Bryan's and Van Sant's return came
the bad news that discus tosser lan
Reed will not be able to compete,
lie underwent a tonsil operation
Monday and will not be sufficiently
recovered by meet time.
Looking over his long medical
list. Weiershause.* concludes that
his corps will be the closest to
full strength that it has been in
weeks. However, the spikers will
still be far from their potential.
Four other performers who have
been ailing" will compete but will
still be way off form. Joss Scroggy
will go in the hall again; Jeff McKae
will attempt to broad jump, but is
suffering from a sore leg; two-miler
Johnny Kaufman will try either the
mile or the two-mile event; and
Cass Bly will run a relay lap.
In addition, two spikers will
prcJaltly be unable to face the
Trojans. Two-miler (ieorge Kauf
man sprained his ankle when he
fell down a staircase last week
and has missed practice all week.
Spear tosser Dick Hennigan is
having trouble with his arm and
will miss the meet.
The "invincible" Trojan squad in
cludes many of the nation's best
trackmen. Sophomore shot put sen
sation Parry O'Brien is already
among the top 10 putters of all time.
In Art Barnard and Jack Davis,
Troy boasts the greatest hurdle tan
dem ever produced at one institu
tion. Barnard has the best outdoor
high hurdle mark of the collegiate
season, a 14.1 effort.
Davis, only a sophomore, has
rolled over the low barriers in
2.'!. 1, which is also the nation's
best performance.
The southlanders also possess the
ailing distance star Jim Newcomb.
Last year the "Chief" set the cin
ders afire, running a 9:OG two-mile
and a 4:07.7 mile—better than the
NCAA record. This year, however,
Newcomb is in a terrific slump and
has been beaten several times by
his own teammates.
Among the other Trojan stand
outs are a trio of high jumpers who
have consistently cleared G ft. 4 in.
Top man Jack Barnes cleared G ft.
G'v in. as a freshman, anil Manuel
Ronquillo leaped G ft. G'-i in. as a
yearling last year. Dick Brombach
has a best effort of G ft. 5 in.


BACK TO THE BLOCKS—Bob Bryan, Cards' ace hurdler, will
return to action this Saturday to face USC, the nation's strongest
track aggregate. Bryan, who has been out of action the past few
weeks with a bum leg, will aid the Indian cause greatly this
weekend.
