### 
Stanford's undefeated golf team
will try for tneir 10th and 11th
straight when they meet the San
Francisco Police Department tomor
row at 1 p.m. and San Jose State I
Saturday morning at 9. Both 1
matches will be played on the Stan
ford golf course.
The policemen, who make a prac
tice of coming up every year with
one of the finest amateur golf teams
in the country, will provide the
Cards their toughest opposition of
the season. Here is the probable
lineup:
Betger at No. One
Playing in the number one spot
will be Bill Betger. Betger has
plenty of experience as a golfer, and
in 1949 was runner-up for the Unit
ed States Public Links Champion
ship.
Number two man will be Bill Mc-
Cool, who was a member of San
Francisco's National Public Cham
pionship team.
A 1 Birdsall, John Maughan, and
Bill Inglis will be playing numbers
three, four, and five respectively.
Inglis, one of the outstanding golfers
in the Bay Area, captains the team.
Playing in the number six spot
will be Ernie Carli, a former San
Francisco City Champion.
On Saturday, the Cards will again
have a tough time when they tangle
with San Jose State. The Spartans
lost to Stanford last week but
scored points, more than any
other Stanford opponent has scored
this season.
Venturi Has Lowest Score
In the number one spot for them
will be Ken Venturi, 1950 San Fran
cisco Champion and 1951 runner
up. Last month Venturi beat Stan
ford's Roland Conklin in the finals
of the Northern California Inter
\ collegiates, and against Stanford last
Friday he shot a (>7. one of the low
est marks on record at the San Jose
| Country Club.
The rest of the San Jose State
i team will probably line up as fol
i lows:
Number two, Jay Hopkins; three,
Ralph Pagano; four, Bill King; five,
Ernie King; and six, Bill Regan.
For Stanford, number one man
will be Dick McElyea; two, Jack
