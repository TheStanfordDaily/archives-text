# Frosh Blast City College
## 
### 
The frosh baseballers slugged
their way to a 14 to 4 win over a
weak City College ol' San Fran
cisco aggregation in a lengthy tilt
played yesterday on the frosh dia
mond.
The frosh tallied a run in each of
the first two innings ofl nothing
ball pitcher Hog Martin. In the
third they really opened fire as Ron
Tomsic, Jack Gebert, Terry Evans,
and Clark Nelson hit and four runs
scored.
CCSF inserted Manny Tivio at
this juncture, but he failed to hold
the score down as Tomsic's double
led a three - run barrage in the
fourth and Jack Gebert's double and
a multitude of errors brought three
more Papooses home in the fifth.
Joe Miller homered in the seventh
with one on to round out the Stan
ford scoring.
Phil Page went the first six in
nings for Stanford and got crdit
for the win, his fifth against two de
feats. Pat Dougherty pitched the
seventh, and Jack Goddard finished
up. All four tallies came off starter
Page.
The frosh's keystone combination
of Warren Goodrich at short and
Jack Gebert at second continued to
sparkle. Goodrich made perfect
pick-ups of the five grounders that
came his way, although his throw
ing arm and umpire's decision cost
him on two occasions.
