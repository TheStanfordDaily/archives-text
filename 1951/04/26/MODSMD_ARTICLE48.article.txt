# Blocking Is Stressed In Spring Grid Drills
## 
### 
After yesterday's blocking and
running scrimmage. Coach Chuck
Taylor thought that the sprin edi
tion ol the Stanford football squad
looked definitely -sharper than it had
in previous drills.
The session yesterday opened with
blocking practice for the linemen,
worked into a hard scrimmage, and
tapered oft with a short drill on
punting and conversions.
Guards Norm Manoogian and
Jack Bonetti looked especially good
in their blocking assignments, while
end Sam Morley showed much im
provement over his previous efforts
at blocking.
All the past weeks' drills in fun
damentals began to pay oft in the
scrimmage. In addition to the gen
eral improvement, there was some
well - timed down - lield blocking.
Center Don Tobin took out two men
at once on one particular occasion,
and halfback Frank Tenerello laid
a couple of crunchers.
The full-scale scrimmage sched

uled for this Saturday morning at
9:30 on the rugby field will be the
first of three near-game-condition
workouts to be held this spring.
Athletic News Director Don Lie
bendorfer announced yesterday that
programs are beins* printed and that
there will be a public address
system in operation during the
scrimmage. Admission is free.
Taylor has divided the team into
two squads â€” the Keds and the
Whites. These will operate as sepa*-
I rate entities with each having an
offensive and defensive unit. How
ever, tiie coaching staff will work as
a whole directing both squads.
