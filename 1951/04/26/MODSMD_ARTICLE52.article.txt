# Spring Show Underway With Side Burns, Hoops
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
The five o'clock shadow that
you might find wandering
around Mem Aud is not a guy
who has lost his razor, but one
of the male cast members of
the forthcoming .Spring Show,
"Who's Blue?"
By May 17 the unshaven ones
hope to have grown authentic side
burns to fit into the 1852 setting of
a New England sea-town.
Dick Casler and John Stackpolc j
have been busy designing period
costumes in true Victorian fashion,
i with hoop skirts for the women.
Chorus and Sailors
The chorus will make up the i
townspeople of Portsmouth, with
six men taking the parts of sailors
who have just disembarked from j
the S.S. Bazoom (named after the
figurehead on the ship).
The show opens with the arrival
•of the S.S. Bazoom, which has
brought home native sons of the
town including heroes Matt Cart
j wright (Don Campbell) and Chris
| Dawson (George Denny).
The heroes have brought back a
mysterious bottle which contains a
; formula to test a woman's chastity.
With the aid of the bottle and a par- j
i lot, whose constant comment is
| "fornus bornus,' the heroes manage j
to upset the prim New England
town and fall in love, respectively,
: with heroines Kate Scott (Betty
Benson) and Lucinda Finch (Sue
| Alter).
Many Rehearsals
; While crew members have been
i hammering and painting six sets of
! scenes including the movable ship,
the cast has been rehearsing five
nights a week and Saturday morn
ings.
One of the chorus members re
marked that she had never been on
such an extensive tour of the cam
pus as that afforded by rehearsals. !
So far the cast has covered the j
Women s Gym, Woodpecker Lodge, ]
the Little Theater, Mem Aud, the

Ram's Head room, and the Knoll.
For tb'e pdst two and a half weeks
rehearsals have been split up into
three groups—the principals under
director John Moore and assistant
director Sam Miller; the chorus
with Bill Barnes, music director,
and Hal Burdick Jr., assistant di
rector; and the dancers under Joan
Hunt, dance director.
Moore explained that he was us
ing such a system so that, when the
entire cast was put together, each
member would know what he was
doing. As each rehearsal progresses,
the cast is being blocked in addi
tion to learning their lines and
songs.
The vigorous rehearsal schedule

is occasionally extended to a Sun
day rehearsal at the beach, where
cast members get to know each oth
' cr in between a few lines and a few
volleyball games.
Behind the scenes there are about
50 students at work on crew, pro
duction, publicity, costumes, and
I makeup, while (>2 actors comprise
| the cast that will be seen on the
; staec of Mem Aud May 17, 18. and
| 10 when "Who's Blue?" will be prc-
I sentcd.

WHO COULD he blue
looking at Rctty Ren
son, leading lady of
the Spring Show ,
"Who's Rlue?" The
show will he pre
sented in Mem Aud
May 17. IX, and 1!).
The five o'clock shadow that
you might find wandering
around Mem Aud is not a guy
who has lost his razor, but one
of the male cast members of
the forthcoming .Spring Show,
"Who's Blue?"
By May 17 the unshaven ones
hope to have grown authentic side
burns to fit into the 1852 setting of
a New England sea-town.
Dick Casler and John Stackpolc j
have been busy designing period
costumes in true Victorian fashion,
i with hoop skirts for the women.
Chorus and Sailors
The chorus will make up the i
townspeople of Portsmouth, with
six men taking the parts of sailors
who have just disembarked from j
the S.S. Bazoom (named after the
figurehead on the ship).
The show opens with the arrival
•of the S.S. Bazoom, which has
brought home native sons of the
town including heroes Matt Cart
j wright (Don Campbell) and Chris
| Dawson (George Denny).
The heroes have brought back a
mysterious bottle which contains a
; formula to test a woman's chastity.
With the aid of the bottle and a par- j
i lot, whose constant comment is
| "fornus bornus,' the heroes manage j
to upset the prim New England
town and fall in love, respectively,
: with heroines Kate Scott (Betty
Benson) and Lucinda Finch (Sue
| Alter).
Many Rehearsals
; While crew members have been
i hammering and painting six sets of
! scenes including the movable ship,
the cast has been rehearsing five
nights a week and Saturday morn
ings.
One of the chorus members re
marked that she had never been on
such an extensive tour of the cam
pus as that afforded by rehearsals. !
So far the cast has covered the j
Women s Gym, Woodpecker Lodge, ]
the Little Theater, Mem Aud, the

Ram's Head room, and the Knoll.
For tb'e pdst two and a half weeks
rehearsals have been split up into
three groups—the principals under
director John Moore and assistant
director Sam Miller; the chorus
with Bill Barnes, music director,
and Hal Burdick Jr., assistant di
rector; and the dancers under Joan
Hunt, dance director.
Moore explained that he was us
ing such a system so that, when the
entire cast was put together, each
member would know what he was
doing. As each rehearsal progresses,

tion to learning their lines and
