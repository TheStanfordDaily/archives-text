## 
### 
George Knoles, associate pro
fessor of history at Stanford, was
elected to the executive com
mittee of the Mississippi Valley
Historical Association during its
three-day meeting at the Univer
sity of Cincinnati last week.
One of the actions of the associa
tion was to send resolutions to the
University of California's Board of
Regents through Governor Earl
Warren in connection with that
i university's loyalty oath disputes.
| These resolutions urged the regents
! to (1) "restore lcÂ» the University of
| California conditions of tenure pro
ductive of sound teaching and un
trammeled research" and (2) "rec
ognize the validity of the decision
which has denounced test oaths."
Other resolutions included an ex
pression of indebtedness to mem
bers of the University of California's
faculty who have "stood firmly
against the recent threat to academ
ic freedom and faculty tenure at
that institution."
