Dr. Wallace Sterling, in a wel
coming statement to the Model
United Nations issued last night,
said:
"I trust that the delegates will
not overlook the symbolism of the
fact that most of their proceedings
will take place within'the shadow
of the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peaee.
"This library contains the
greatest collection,s in the world
on Communist, Fascist, Nazi, and
Socialist revolutions and their
underground oppositions.
"This is the record of the past.
You will help write that of the
future.
"Your interest in international
relations, as demonstrated by
your presence here, bears bright
promise that our leaders of to
morrow will have deep faith in
the ability of men of all races and
nationalities to settle their dif
ferences by negotiation."
