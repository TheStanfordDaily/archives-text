# Trackmen Play Host To Troy
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Another Southern California
track juggernaut, boasting some
of the nation's outstanding cin
! der competitors, will invade
Stanford Stadium tomorrow to
meet an undermanned Indian
team.
The first field events arc slated
. at 1:30 and the mile will begin at 2.
Student, body card holders will be j
; charged an admission fee of 50 cents.!
!
The well-rounded Trojans, vvno)
j routed Illinois and Michigan in the J
Coliseum last Saturday, are the class I
of the Pacific Coast and will bo fa- j
vored to grab another NCAA title
I again this year.
Unlike most of their meets this j
| season, Stanford expects to pick up!
the majority of its points on the track
where the injury-riddled Indians
have been improving steadily. Photo
finishes arc expected in 100 yard
} dash, 440, and relay events.
Tomorrow fans will witness the
greatest collection of shot putters
in dual meet history. On the basis
of past epprerformanoes, it is pos
sible that a put of 51 feet may take
fifth place.
SC's ace putter Parry O'Brien
heaved the shot 55 ft. 4'/i> in. last week I
and is favored to win the event I
Fighting it out for the remaining
places will be Stanford's Lew Davis \
(51 ft. 7% in.), Bob Mathias (51 ft. j
l'/z in.), and Chuck Hokanson (51 ft.
! 1% in.), and USC's Jess Swopc (51 ft.
6V2 in).
The meet tomorrow will mark the
return of two of Stanford's outstand
ing competitors — Merritt Van Sant, j
! ace broad jumper, and Bob Bryan, I
low hurdler.
Bryan, who has been out for sev- |
eral weeks, is not expected to place
in his favorite event, the low hurdles.
SC's Jack Davis (:23.1) and Art Bar
nard (:23.(>) would be a tough duo
to beat, even if Bryan were in top
shape. Stanford will also enter
sophomore Bob Mathias (:24) and
Jim Pollock (:24.2).
Much of Stanford's hope for
keeping the score down will rest on
the shoulders of sprinter and quar
ter miler Wilbur Taylor. Card cap
tain for the meet.
Taylor may or may not enter the
air-tight quarter mile run, but he is
definitely slated for the 220 and relay
duty.
Since the Trojans are strong in the
high hurdles, Coach Weiershauser
plans to switch relay and hurdle man
Bill Storum (:48.6) to the open quar
ter. Therefore, Captain Taylor may
be saved for just the 220 and relay
races.
John Bradley, converted sprinter,
is the Trojan's chief hope in the quar
ter mile. Bradley who has won his
last two 440s handily, took over for
veteran Norm Stocks, whose pulled
muscle put him out for the season.
Even though world record
breaker Dick Attlesey has gradu
ated. Southern Cal is still ex
tremely strong in the high hurdles.
Art Barnard (: 14.1) has the best
time in the nation, and Jack Davis
(: 14.5) is close behind. With Sto
rum running the quarter, Stanford
will have a single entry in this
event, Darrcll Kreitz (:14.8).
A blanket finish is predicted for the

100 yard dash, now that SC's Mel
Patton has graduated. Trojan vet
eran A 1 Mejia and Stanford's im
proving Maurice Parsons have iden
tical times of :09.9, while Indians
Pete McKay and Jim Pollock, who
placed second and third in the Oxy
meet, may press the favorites.
Some of Southern California's out
standing field men besides shot put
ter O'Brien, include pole vaulter Walt
Jensen (14 ft. 3 7-16 in.), and high
jumper Jack Barnes (6 ft. 6 in.).
USC is favored to sweep the high
jump and pole vault, while the In
dians may shut out mighty Troy in
the discus.
Besides Barnes, the Trojans have
Dick Brombach (G ft. s>/4 in.) and
Manuel Ronquillo (G ft. 4% in.) in the
high jump. Norm Jiles, at 6 ft! 3V4 in.,
will be the Indians' chief hope in this
event.
With Sim Iness ineligible and El
mer Willhoite out for football, Stan
ford, with Mathias, Chuck Renfro and
Frank Bradley, will probably sweep
the discu*.

Unlike most of their meets this j

the majority of its points on the track
where the injury-riddled Indians
have been improving steadily. Photo
finishes arc expected in 100 yard

Tomorrow fans will witness the
greatest collection of shot putters
in dual meet history. On the basis
of past epprerformanoes, it is pos
sible that a put of 51 feet may take
fifth place.
SC's ace putter Parry O'Brien
heaved the shot 55 ft. 4'/i> in. last week I

Fighting it out for the remaining
places will be Stanford's Lew Davis \
(51 ft. 7% in.), Bob Mathias (51 ft. j
l'/z in.), and Chuck Hokanson (51 ft.
! 1% in.), and USC's Jess Swopc (51 ft.

The meet tomorrow will mark the
return of two of Stanford's outstand
ing competitors — Merritt Van Sant, j
! ace broad jumper, and Bob Bryan, I
low hurdler.
Bryan, who has been out for sev- |
eral weeks, is not expected to place
in his favorite event, the low hurdles.
SC's Jack Davis (:23.1) and Art Bar
nard (:23.(>) would be a tough duo
to beat, even if Bryan were in top
shape. Stanford will also enter
sophomore Bob Mathias (:24) and
Jim Pollock (:24.2).
Much of Stanford's hope for
keeping the score down will rest on
the shoulders of sprinter and quar
ter miler Wilbur Taylor. Card cap
tain for the meet.
Taylor may or may not enter the
air-tight quarter mile run, but he is
definitely slated for the 220 and relay
duty.
Since the Trojans are strong in the
high hurdles, Coach Weiershauser
plans to switch relay and hurdle man
Bill Storum (:48.6) to the open quar
ter. Therefore, Captain Taylor may
be saved for just the 220 and relay
races.
John Bradley, converted sprinter,
is the Trojan's chief hope in the quar
ter mile. Bradley who has won his
last two 440s handily, took over for
veteran Norm Stocks, whose pulled
muscle put him out for the season.
Even though world record
breaker Dick Attlesey has gradu
ated. Southern Cal is still ex
tremely strong in the high hurdles.
Art Barnard (: 14.1) has the best
time in the nation, and Jack Davis
(: 14.5) is close behind. With Sto
rum running the quarter, Stanford
will have a single entry in this
event, Darrcll Kreitz (:14.8).
A blanket finish is predicted for the

100 yard dash, now that SC's Mel
Patton has graduated. Trojan vet
eran A 1 Mejia and Stanford's im
proving Maurice Parsons have iden
tical times of :09.9, while Indians
Pete McKay and Jim Pollock, who
placed second and third in the Oxy
meet, may press the favorites.

eran A 1 Mejia and Stanford's im
proving Maurice Parsons have iden
tical times of :09.9, while Indians
Pete McKay and Jim Pollock, who
placed second and third in the Oxy
meet, may press the favorites.
Some of Southern California's out
standing field men besides shot put
ter O'Brien, include pole vaulter Walt
Jensen (14 ft. 3 7-16 in.), and high
jumper Jack Barnes (6 ft. 6 in.).
USC is favored to sweep the high
jump and pole vault, while the In
dians may shut out mighty Troy in
the discus.
Besides Barnes, the Trojans have
Dick Brombach (G ft. s>/4 in.) and
Manuel Ronquillo (G ft. 4% in.) in the
high jump. Norm Jiles, at 6 ft! 3V4 in.,
will be the Indians' chief hope in this
event.
With Sim Iness ineligible and El

Frank Bradley, will probably sweep
the discu*.
Another Southern California
track juggernaut, boasting some
of the nation's outstanding cin
! der competitors, will invade
Stanford Stadium tomorrow to
meet an undermanned Indian
team.
The first field events arc slated
. at 1:30 and the mile will begin at 2.
Student, body card holders will be j
; charged an admission fee of 50 cents.!
!
The well-rounded Trojans, vvno)
j routed Illinois and Michigan in the J
Coliseum last Saturday, are the class I
of the Pacific Coast and will bo fa- j
vored to grab another NCAA title
I again this year.
Unlike most of their meets this j
| season, Stanford expects to pick up!
the majority of its points on the track
where the injury-riddled Indians
have been improving steadily. Photo
finishes arc expected in 100 yard
} dash, 440, and relay events.
Tomorrow fans will witness the
greatest collection of shot putters
in dual meet history. On the basis
of past epprerformanoes, it is pos
sible that a put of 51 feet may take
fifth place.
SC's ace putter Parry O'Brien
heaved the shot 55 ft. 4'/i> in. last week I
and is favored to win the event I
Fighting it out for the remaining
places will be Stanford's Lew Davis \
(51 ft. 7% in.), Bob Mathias (51 ft. j
l'/z in.), and Chuck Hokanson (51 ft.
! 1% in.), and USC's Jess Swopc (51 ft.
6V2 in).
The meet tomorrow will mark the
return of two of Stanford's outstand
ing competitors — Merritt Van Sant, j
! ace broad jumper, and Bob Bryan, I
low hurdler.
Bryan, who has been out for sev- |
eral weeks, is not expected to place
in his favorite event, the low hurdles.
SC's Jack Davis (:23.1) and Art Bar
nard (:23.(>) would be a tough duo
to beat, even if Bryan were in top
shape. Stanford will also enter
sophomore Bob Mathias (:24) and
Jim Pollock (:24.2).
Much of Stanford's hope for
keeping the score down will rest on
the shoulders of sprinter and quar
ter miler Wilbur Taylor. Card cap
tain for the meet.
Taylor may or may not enter the
air-tight quarter mile run, but he is
definitely slated for the 220 and relay
duty.
Since the Trojans are strong in the
high hurdles, Coach Weiershauser
plans to switch relay and hurdle man
Bill Storum (:48.6) to the open quar
ter. Therefore, Captain Taylor may
be saved for just the 220 and relay
races.
John Bradley, converted sprinter,
is the Trojan's chief hope in the quar
ter mile. Bradley who has won his
last two 440s handily, took over for
veteran Norm Stocks, whose pulled
muscle put him out for the season.
Even though world record
breaker Dick Attlesey has gradu
ated. Southern Cal is still ex
tremely strong in the high hurdles.
Art Barnard (: 14.1) has the best
time in the nation, and Jack Davis
(: 14.5) is close behind. With Sto
rum running the quarter, Stanford
will have a single entry in this
event, Darrcll Kreitz (:14.8).
A blanket finish is predicted for the

100 yard dash, now that SC's Mel
Patton has graduated. Trojan vet
