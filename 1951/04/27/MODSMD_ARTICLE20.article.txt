# Realism Keynotes the UN Conference
## 
### 
Stanford's little UN swings into high gear to
day as the over 300 delegates from 59 Western
schools start their second day of oratory, de
bate, and compromise.
Keynote for the first day was realism. Real
ism experienced when "free country" dele
gates saw Russia jump to take a noisy defensive
position against Western-bloc moves; realism
felt by Soviet delegates when they saw them
selves outvoted by the free countries. Realism
experienced by all delegates who saw what a
terrific job faces the Big UN when men of to
tally different philosophies try to solve a joint
problem.
Realism but optimism, too. Optimism from
those who saw encouragement in the very fact
that so many students could get together to dis
cuss Korea and what lies behind and beyond
today's worst trouble spot. Stanford President

Ted Buttner told the delegates that the meeting
was "proof that student still have faith in the
United Nations."
When Dr. Ralph Bunche planes in from New
York today to take over as Secretary-General,
he'll see an encouraging sample of what col
leges and universities can do when they get
together for a real purpose. Long hours of re
search and planning have gone into this con
ference. And those hours have not been
wasted, for delegates and spectators were
unanimous in their praise of the first day's
work.
To the many out-of-town and out-of-state vis
itors, welcome to Stanford and we hope your
experience is valuable. And to the lIR, key
group in sponsoring this meeting, thanks for
proving your value to Stanford by promoting
the year's top campus event. --G.M.
