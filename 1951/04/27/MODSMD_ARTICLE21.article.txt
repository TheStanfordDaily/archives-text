# CAMPUS OPINION
## Art, Literature Students Needed Also 
### 
To the Editor:
It is very disconcerting to note that only students of
the social sciences are being considered for foreign
• xchange scholarships ottered by the ASSU. To be
sure, the art of living peacefully together upon the
earth is today the most important of all; but it is a
mistake to think that this art can be discovered by
what we term the social sciences alone.
Indeed, the whole departmentalization of the
learned disciplines, though necessary for smooth
administration in a university, is deceptive.
Certainly international amity can never be achieved
merely by manipulation of governmental form or even
by the requisite economic and social adjustments, al
though it is a typically American fallacy to assume
that these are the only things necessary and that the
almighty dollar can readily effect them—a most gall
ing assumption to many educated foreigners.
Some time ago a Stanfoid student informed me that
the front of the Russian headquarters in Vienna was
decorated with colossal photographs: on one side, pic
tures of Russian art, the opera and the theater; on the
other, pictures of American tanks and other arms be
ing loaded upon ships.
Now, no propaganda is so effective as that based
oil the truth, as in part this is. and no amount of
mere money spent on radio stations and programs
can counterbalance whatever is true in such charges.
Further, th"se Russian charges only confirm a long
standing prejudice of Europeans towards Americans.
In 1934, when I was a student at the American Acad
emy in Rome, I was invited one Sunday to the Ru
manian Academy. Our group was warmly received,
but after the social amenities had been met, one Ru
manian student—a poet—asked us Americans why we
had come to Rome. He brushed aside our responses
and urged us to go back—immediately— to Detroit and
make cars. This thing Americans could do and do well,
he said, but they had no interest or ability in art and
literature.
1 his prejudice is wide-spread, and like many preju
dices, it endures because it is based partially upon
I act. The decision ol ASSU to send only students of
the social sciences and only students much interested
in extracurricular activities fosters and aggravates
this old prejudice.
The opinion of cultured foreigners towards Amer
icans would definitely be raised by our sending
some very serious students of philosophy, art, and
literature, young poets and artists, to foreign uni
versities. and as many of these as possible should be
masters of the language.
Perhaps nothing is more offensive to a foreigner
than tin* presumption that his language is not worth
looming, and even if he is French, Spanish, or German,
lie very rarely meets any American who can speak his
language decently. Undoubtedly a larger percentage
of any other foieign nationals with whom he comes in
contact speak hi:; language.

Let us hope, then, that ASSU will broaden it poli
cy and accept at least some students from these other
