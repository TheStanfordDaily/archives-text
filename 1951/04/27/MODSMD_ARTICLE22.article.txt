# MacArthur Myth

To the Editor:
In answer to Shirley Prick's confused statement in
regard to the Truman-MacArthur affair, it can be
seen that despite her pleas for objective evaluation of
an individual, she herself goes to the blind extreme of
judging the men on basis of rhetorical ability. Miss
Prick decries conformity, yet she herself conforms to
the almost religious characteristics of Mac Arthur and
to the bizarre emotional fervor which attended to his
return.
I can agree that the general's speech was well
organized and presented, but what he proposed cur
dled my blood, and his obvious appeal to sheer histri
onics at his speech's conclusion merely added fuel to
the overall emotional fervor. One would imagine that
a person soberly evaluating the man would be some
what more concerned with the implications of his
policy and the setting in which it was presented than
with its oratory alone.
We are seeing the shameful spectacle of the Repub
lican leaders in Congress attempting to utilize the
keyed-up sentiment of the public's welcome as a po
litical lever ... at a time when the coolest scrutiny
ol Mac Arthur's policy is essential. I am afraid that
Miss Frick, along with so many others, has fallen prey
to the Mac Arthur myth— too entranced by his pres
ence to determine what he has proposed.
