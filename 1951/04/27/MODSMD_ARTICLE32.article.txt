Stanford's famed "orphan crew," perennially strong in spirit but weak
in cash, may have at long last found a foster parent to assume part of
its financial burdens.
I hose of you who glance at the front page of a newspaper before turning
to the sports section have already read of the proposal placed before Inter-
Jraternity Council last night. A plan which, if adopted by the Farm's 24 '
lraternities, would not only provide financial aid for the orphans, but would
also constitute an invaluable psychological boost to each individual mem
ber of the crew.
Reams ol melodramatic copy have been mass-produced about our crew
in the past lew years. We've all read of their dawn-time workouts in bat
tered and miserable craft; their unpaid student coach; their inability to
gain official administration recognition; their long and wearisome efforts
to raise the wherewithal to compete in such far-away places as Seattle, Los
Angeles, and Marietta. And we've all read of their undaunted spirit in the
lace at these and many more obstacles.
The hell of it is, it's all true.
The other morning, for example, Coach Jim Beggs, the coaching staff,
an extra oarsman, and the launch driver were stranded on a mudflat for
three hours because of the mechanical inadequacies of the coaching
launch. Me we eventually rescued ingloriously by the Harbor Master.
Master.
And last spring, at least three of the crew were lucky to get six hours'
.sleep per night during the three weeks preceding the national competition
at Marietta; they were too busy scraping up the necessary funds to trans
port them to the Ohio city. Somehow they still found enough energy, when
they finally made it, to contribute to Stanford's stirring fourth-place per
formance.
The $4000 or $4500 contributed by the fraternities would not establish the
rrew on a really firm financial footing. But this mony would:
1. Provide, together with alumni and other contributions, a sufficient
amount (o relieve the individual athletes of (he necessity of paying their
own way.
2. Make the crew independent of the "win-or-else" contributions
which currently make up a good portion of their support.
.'l. As a by-product of the above two considerations, remove some of
the psychological barriers which have undoubtedly reduced the crew's
racing efficiency.
Thus, the individual members would no longer be competing under con
stant pressure to win or lose much of their support, nor would they be
forced to contribute time and conditioning to the raising of funds.
The public relations benefits that Stanford has received from the crew's 1
successful participation against the nation's best is clearly evident. The
story of their spirited battle-against-odds has even appeared in such a dis- j
lant and impressive publication as the New York Times.
So any contribution to the crew promises not only to relieve what is 1
at best an embarrassing situation to the school and Administration—it
should provide an attractive return on the investment in the form of <
good-will and beneficial publicity for Stanford.

its financial burdens.
I hose of you who glance at the front page of a newspaper before turning
to the sports section have already read of the proposal placed before Inter-
Jraternity Council last night. A plan which, if adopted by the Farm's 24 '
lraternities, would not only provide financial aid for the orphans, but would
also constitute an invaluable psychological boost to each individual mem
ber of the crew.
Reams ol melodramatic copy have been mass-produced about our crew
in the past lew years. We've all read of their dawn-time workouts in bat
tered and miserable craft; their unpaid student coach; their inability to
gain official administration recognition; their long and wearisome efforts
to raise the wherewithal to compete in such far-away places as Seattle, Los
Angeles, and Marietta. And we've all read of their undaunted spirit in the
lace at these and many more obstacles.
The hell of it is, it's all true.
The other morning, for example, Coach Jim Beggs, the coaching staff,
an extra oarsman, and the launch driver were stranded on a mudflat for
three hours because of the mechanical inadequacies of the coaching
launch. Me we eventually rescued ingloriously by the Harbor Master.
Master.
And last spring, at least three of the crew were lucky to get six hours'
.sleep per night during the three weeks preceding the national competition
at Marietta; they were too busy scraping up the necessary funds to trans
port them to the Ohio city. Somehow they still found enough energy, when
they finally made it, to contribute to Stanford's stirring fourth-place per
formance.
The $4000 or $4500 contributed by the fraternities would not establish the
rrew on a really firm financial footing. But this mony would:
1. Provide, together with alumni and other contributions, a sufficient
amount (o relieve the individual athletes of (he necessity of paying their
own way.
2. Make the crew independent of the "win-or-else" contributions
which currently make up a good portion of their support.
.'l. As a by-product of the above two considerations, remove some of
the psychological barriers which have undoubtedly reduced the crew's
racing efficiency.
Thus, the individual members would no longer be competing under con
stant pressure to win or lose much of their support, nor would they be
forced to contribute time and conditioning to the raising of funds.
The public relations benefits that Stanford has received from the crew's 1
successful participation against the nation's best is clearly evident. The
story of their spirited battle-against-odds has even appeared in such a dis- j
lant and impressive publication as the New York Times.
So any contribution to the crew promises not only to relieve what is 1
at best an embarrassing situation to the school and Administration—it
should provide an attractive return on the investment in the form of <
good-will and beneficial publicity for Stanford.
Stanford's famed "orphan crew," perennially strong in spirit but weak
in cash, may have at long last found a foster parent to assume part of
its financial burdens.
