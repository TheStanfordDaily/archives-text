# Spring Grid Scrum Tomorrow
## Red, White Teams Engage In Football Civil War 
### JIM MADISON 
Tomorrow morning at 9:30 at the rugby field the Stanford Family
will get their first official look at the 1951 Big Red Machine, when
Coach Chuck Taylor and his staff display their charges in the first
of three game-style scrimmages scheduled for this spring.
The team has been divided into two sguads—the Reds vs. the

Whites — for tomorrow's struggle. |
Jerseys are numbered, programs i"
have been printed, there will be a
public address system, and admis
sion is free—all for the convenience
of the spectators.
Game conditions will prevail for
the scrimmage, which is scheduled j
to last two hours, with the excep
tion that there will be no kickoffs. i
After each touchdown the ball will
be given directly to the team scored |
upon.
In addition to the veterans from
last year's team, a number of new- j
comers to the varsity scene will be |
playing in the starting lineups to
morrow.
For the Reds, Dick Gant, frosh
stalwart last season, will open at
the offensive right tackle spot, and
Ron Cook, speedy halfback from
the frosh, will cavort also on of
fense at left half.
On offense for the Whites, A 1 |
Kirkland, who played on the SC
lrosh two years ago, then trans- j
ferred to the Farm to sit out last
fall, will make his first appearance i
in an Indian jersey at left end.
His running mate at right end will
be Dud Hersehback, up from the
frosh. Doug Pinto, a made - over
tackle, will play his first game as i
fullback, providing his pulled thigh i
is in shape.
Newcomers on defense for the
Reds will include Cooky Rarbeau
at left end, Larry Webster at left
tackle, Bob Armstrong at riftht
tackle, Tom Allen at left line
backer, Doug Collins at left half,
and Eric Mack at safety—all up
from last season's frosh. Dick
Borda, who played on the JV's last
fall, will hold down the middle
guard spot.
The White defense squad consists !
mainly of veterans from last fall
with only ex-frosh Ted Tanner at j
middle linebacker and Dave El
dredge, who sat out a year of ineli
gibility, at left half rating' the honor
of first-timers.
Yesterday's practice was confined i
mainly to dummy scrimmage, and !
today's will be more of the same |
with little of the rough stuff, as the j
squad tapers off for their big go
tomorrow.
Gordy Rice, veteran of the '4!)
Indian squad, who was forced to
the sidelines last fall while his leg,
broken in the Bitf Game of '49,
knit sufficiently, will be back to
morrow backing up the right side
of the line for the White squad.
