## Baseballers Enplane For Los Angeles 
### 
Stanford's high - flying base
ball nine will eat breakfast in
Palo Alto today and have lunch
in Los Angeles just before meet
ing the UCLA Bruins at 3 this
afternoon in Westwood.
Twenty players and three coaches
, will fly down to the Southland for
J the all-important two-game series
with the UCLAns. To stay in the
race the Cards must win both games
unless Cal can knock oft USC in
i their game across town on the Bo
| vard diamond.
The big question will be: Can the
Cards overcome the Westwood jinx
which has plagued them for the last
five years? Coach Ev Dean thinks
, they will. He gives a great deal of
I credit to his infield, commenting,
l "Tommy Shaw has made a fine ad
justment at third, and he's certainly
I a great clutch hitter. Over at second
we have the young Charlie Gehrin
ger of the infield in Art Abraham
son. Quiet and unassuming, he gets
the job done and handles balls no
| other second baseman in the league
would reach."
Dean adds that he thinks Bruce
Cameron will take to Bruin pitching
I as he did against Santa Clara, where
! he hit a long double and a home
run over the left field screen. Catch
ers Dick Corzine and Bill Herron
also have drawn the head man's
praise for their handling of pitchers
and good steady performances be
hind the plate.
Rog Osenbaugh (2-1) and Joe
Chez (1-1) will start the two games
in the Southland.
