# Chavalas Hurls Delts to Win
## 
### 
Proving that he is nearly as adept
at softball as he is at basketball,
Stanford's jayvee basketball coach,
Gits Chavalas, handcuffed opposing
batters with only two hits yester
day as he led his undefeated Delt I
teammates to an 11 to 1 intramural
victory over the Fiji I club.
Chavalas' triumph was featured
by no less than 12 strikeouts, three
straight in both the second and third
innings. Not to be outdone by his
batters, Gus also aided his own
cause by driving in two runs.
The Delts scored in every inning,
amassing a grand total of 11 runs
on an equal number of base hits.
The Fiji infield committed nine er
rors during the course of the five
inning contest. Only bright spot on
the Fiji record was the batting of
Dun Evans, who collected both Fiii

hits and drove in the tying run in
the first inning.
The win was the third straight
triumph for both Chavalas and the
Delts.
