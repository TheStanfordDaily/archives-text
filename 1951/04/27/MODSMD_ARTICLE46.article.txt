### MARY MASSEY 
When the Stanford Tokyo Club made news recently by giving
a shell to Stanford's crew, it was news to many students that such
a club existed.
The Stanford Tokyo Club is only one of 66 alumni clubs active
throughout the v/orld.
Active clubs are functioning in Saudi Arabia and London, and

! the Stanford Club at Shanghai has
I been working in Hong Kong since
! the Communists moved into Shang
hai.
A Paris Club is now being
| formed, and new clubs are being
planned through Europe and South
America. Most of the clubs are in
the United States, particularly in
| California.
The Stanford Club program, one
of the biggest single jobs of the

j Alumni Association, has grown
within the past three years from 40
to 06 active clubs and 11 profession
! al groups.
Many Projects
Besides their social functions, the
clubs take part in specific projects.
They provide scholarships and ar
range for prospective students to
come to Stanford.
Movies are taken of Stanford's
| football games and distributed to
1 the clubs. This year 21 clubs saw
every Stanford game within two
weeks after it had been played, and
i the films are still being shown
around the world.
The Alumni Association publishes
! and distributes the Alumni Review
| and clubs sponsor the alumni con
ferences. ,
The Alumni Review, edited by

' mation of interest to alums about

| alums. Last year, the Stanford
Alumni Review, which publishes ten
! issues a year, won more top honors
i in national competition than any
I other magazine of its circulation.

: creased from four to 11 a year with

The Stanford Club sponsors the
| annual conference held at the Uni
versity, and May 10 of this year will
