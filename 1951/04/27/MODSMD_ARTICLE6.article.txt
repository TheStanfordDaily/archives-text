# IFC Support Of Crew Proposed
## 
### 
A proposal whereby each fraternity man would contribute 50
cents a month toward support of Stanford's "orphan crew" came
up for a stormy round of controversy at last night's Interfraternity
Council meeting.
Fifty-cent contributions by Row men would amount to approxi-

mately $4,000 a year and virtual
"adoption of the orphan." A rough
budget of $4,900 a year was pro
posed by supporters of the plan
whereby minimum crew expenses
could be met.
The budget does not include ex
pense of a coach's salary (at pres
ent his time i$ donated).
IFC members, after debating the
plan, decided to take the> proposal
back to their individual houses be
fore voting.
In a mimeographed sheet putting
forth arguments for the plan, sup
porters said:
"It is a shameful situation at best
when a school as rich as Stanford is
reputed to be must require that the
individual participants in a sport
raise the money for their own ac
tivity by begging on street corners.
"Nor is this the administration's
fault; the plain facts in the case are
that there is not enough money to
go around."
The plan calls for contributions
from both pledges and actives in
Stanford's 24 fraternities.
The mimeographed sheet contin
ued: "It is hoped that the fraterni
ties will be the nucleus of a strong
support movement within the stu
dent body itself.
"Eventually the various living
groups which constitute the Stan
ford Family should be able to fol
low up on this plan and furnish
some additional support for the
crew, support which comes from
where it rightfully should, the Stan
ford student body."
Chief objections to the plan cen
tered around the inconvenience to
fraternity men of numerous assess
ments on house bills and the ques
tion of "where to draw the line."
It. was argued thai organizations
of similar status to the crew, such
as the Stanford ski team, could logi
cally ask for IFC support, which
IFC could not logically refuse.
A budget of expenses submitted
by the crew to the SAB for 1950-51
totals $8,000, compared to last year's
operating expenses of $4,700.
The skeleton budget proposed last
night includes $4,000 for traveling
expenses (for trips to Los Angeles.
Seattle, Berkeley, and Marietta);
$.100 for oars; $400 for launch main
tenance; and $200 for shell mainte
nance.

fraternity men of numerous assess
ments on house bills and the ques
tion of "where to draw the line."
It. was argued thai organizations
of similar status to the crew, such
as the Stanford ski team, could logi
cally ask for IFC support, which
IFC could not logically refuse.
A budget of expenses submitted
by the crew to the SAB for 1950-51
totals $8,000, compared to last year's
operating expenses of $4,700.
The skeleton budget proposed last
night includes $4,000 for traveling
expenses (for trips to Los Angeles.
Seattle, Berkeley, and Marietta);
$.100 for oars; $400 for launch main
tenance; and $200 for shell mainte
nance.
A proposal whereby each fraternity man would contribute 50
cents a month toward support of Stanford's "orphan crew" came
up for a stormy round of controversy at last night's Interfraternity
Council meeting.
Fifty-cent contributions by Row men would amount to approxi-

mately $4,000 a year and virtual
"adoption of the orphan." A rough
budget of $4,900 a year was pro
posed by supporters of the plan
whereby minimum crew expenses
could be met.
The budget does not include ex
pense of a coach's salary (at pres
ent his time i$ donated).
IFC members, after debating the
plan, decided to take the> proposal
back to their individual houses be
fore voting.
In a mimeographed sheet putting
forth arguments for the plan, sup
porters said:
"It is a shameful situation at best
when a school as rich as Stanford is
reputed to be must require that the
individual participants in a sport
raise the money for their own ac
tivity by begging on street corners.
"Nor is this the administration's
fault; the plain facts in the case are
that there is not enough money to
go around."
The plan calls for contributions
from both pledges and actives in
Stanford's 24 fraternities.
The mimeographed sheet contin
ued: "It is hoped that the fraterni
ties will be the nucleus of a strong
support movement within the stu
dent body itself.
"Eventually the various living
groups which constitute the Stan
ford Family should be able to fol
low up on this plan and furnish
some additional support for the
crew, support which comes from
where it rightfully should, the Stan
ford student body."
