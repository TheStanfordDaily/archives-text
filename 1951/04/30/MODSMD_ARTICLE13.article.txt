# War Debated By Model UN
## 
### 
Now Communist aggression flared
in the Balkans this weekend and
threw a new challenge in the face
of collective security, as 350 stu
dents turned Stanford into the are
na of the United Nations.
One hundred thousand Bulgarian
troops are massed at their southern
border and launching spearhead at
tacks into Yugoslavia, delegates
were told in an emergency session
of tiie Security Council Friday
night.
Within 18 hours of the cable's aj -
rival, an outraged Assembly Ind
voted a ceasc-fire order, calling for
withdrawal of troops, creation o f r.
UN Good Offices Commission, and,
if negotiation failed, the concerted
action of all member nations again t
Bulgarian aggressors.
The Balkans incident came a. a
surprise to the students of West
ern colleges and universities who
assembled here Thursday as inter
national statesmen working for
peace in Korea. Up to the hour of
adjournment Saturday afternoon,
delegates grouped around the plac
ards of 60 countries transformed
Memorial Auditorium into the As
sembly Hall of the United Nations.
Presiding under the blue and
white banner of the UN, Dr. Ralph

Bunche complimented delegates on
the realism of the conference. He
said later, "We have had heated
debates, acrimonious exchanges,
charges and counter charges. In
other words, we have been acting
very human here, and that, after all,
is the fundamental explanation of
the indispcnsability of the United
Nations in world affairs."
Alan .... Nichols assisted Dr.
Bunche as Secretary-Cieneral and
authority on procedure and sub
stance of the UN Charter.
Saturday's cease - fire order was
passed over strong Soviet demands
that Yugoslavia be branded the ag
gressor. George Velliotes led the
Soviet bloc opposition in true UN
tradition, punctuating debate with
an occasional "Mac Arthur the Giant.
Butcher" or "Marionette Master
Harry Truman."
But dramatic disagreement was
| not the order of the day. Major
; resolutions came out of the two lonr*
| Assembly sessions and will be for
warded to Warren Austin, U.S. del
egate to the real United Nations.
A permanent world police force,
recruited, financed, and trained by
the UN, empowered to inspect the
military power of all member na
tions, was agreed to by an enthusi
astic majority. Agreement was
reached on several phases of post
war reconstruction in Korea.
A year ago Stanford, through the
lIR, decided to tak" on the model
United Nations, the first conference
i of its scope in the country, at the
| request of the Collegiate Council for
| the United Nations. Plans are al
j ready under way to follow up the
[ precedent set here in other colleges
| in coming years.
