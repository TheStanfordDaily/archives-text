# On Two Fraternity Policies
## 
### 
Recent proposals brought before IFC raise
two important questions of general policy for
Stanford fraternities.
At last Thursday's meeting IFC president
Tony Garrett said he felt the proposal for a fra
ternity-supported crew program was right in
line with President Sterling's proclamation that
fraternities must go, once they fail to contribute
to Stanford's welfare.
We are sure Garrett had the best intentions,
but we do not feel that the new measure is the
type of "contribution" that Dr. Sterling had in
mind. Surely the President meant more than
the donation of the mighty dollar.
The houses' contributions lie in participation
in campus activities, in assuring good scholar
ship and providing recreation for their mem
bers, and in teaching men to live together, all
co-operating for the common good. IFC atten
tion should be directed toward fulfilling these
goals rather than issues not related to the fra
ternity system.

As to the second matter of general fraternity
policy: We feel that the IFC doesn't have the
authority to pass any rulings on matters other
than those relating directly to fraternities and
which affect the whole fraternity system. Is
sues such as the maintaining of foreign schol
arship students, should be referred to the indi
vidual houses for settlement, as was done re
cently.
Other issues, such as the plan for crew sup
port, reach even beyond the jurisdiction of the
house and rest completely with the individual.
In the case of the foreign students each fra
ternity man has an interest in the issue AS A
MEMBER OF A HOUSE. He should rightfully
be subjected to the majority rule within his
house, but neither he nor the house should be
bonded by the will of the rest of the fraternities.
In cases such as the new crew proposals, the
issue is entirely independent of the fraternity
man AS A MEMBER OF A HOUSE; thus the
choice should be left to the individual.
