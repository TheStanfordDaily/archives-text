# Will the Class of '54 Be Indifferent?

1950-51: a great Stanford year?
When we came this fall to Stanford as fresh
men, we were welcomed with the glorification
of Stanford ideals and the Stanford tradition.
Now that we are v/ell settled in our new home,
we have begun to accept these ideals and tradi
tions as a part of us, but are they the same ones
that we were so h&ppy to accept at the begin
ning? Are we accepting the true "Stanford tra
dition" or are we only accepting something
that is traditional to accept at Stanford, namely
an attitude of indifference.
What is this indifference? It can best be ex
plained as an attitude of doing what we per
sonally find most pleasing to ourselves. If what
we like to do is in accord with what is best for
the school or current Stanford projects, all well
and good. If it is not, we don't do it, and we are
indifferent to what does happen.
We are happy to attend winning athletic
events but it is no fun to cheer v/hen a team is
losing, so we don't. We like to have dances on
campus ,but usually we don't feel like attending
this or that particular one. We think that bene
fit drives are worthwhile but "don't have the
money now." The student organizations are
"pretty good," but there are so many correc

tions that could be made if we only had the
time.
The examples of the above are seen every
week around campus: Reg dance and all-cam
pus dance financial failures; small crowds of
spectators at varsity baseball games; only fifty
per cent of the students bothering to stop at the
polls and cast their votes for the student leaders
for next year.
Is this indifference the true "Stanford tradi
tion" or is it an attitude that is traditional to de
velop and not to try to change ?
The class of '54 has not at yet fallen prey to
this pseudo tradition, but during these last few
weeks and throughout next year we will likely
fall into the chasms of this attitude. We may
proclaim that we won't, as most Stanfordites
now do, but action has always spoken louder
than words. Watch how many participate fully
in the Con Home drive that will take place next
week. Let the class of '54 be there as one strong
body supporting "Stanford's children," and
demonstrate to the rest of the school that we
accepted the true Stanford tradition.
May the years from 1950-54 be the greatest
that Stanford will ever have because the class
of '54 has not developed an attitude of indif
ference. â€”T.P.
