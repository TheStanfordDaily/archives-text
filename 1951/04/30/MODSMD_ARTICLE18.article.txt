## Bull Sessions 'Sophomoric' 
### 
To ;he Editor:
We deplore the sophoinoric wit displayed by the
Daily Bull Sessions and the heavy sarcasm used by
Mr. Kammen in his letter on the Mac Arthur issue.
Admittedly, there has been a great deal of emotional
fervor shown, which Mr. Kammen would call "bi
zarre"; but this display by the American people is
due, in part, to the lack of consistent leadership shown
here at home. Mac Arthur was a Far-Eastern bulwark
which held the confidence of the people.
We agree with Mr. Kammen that a cool-headed
scrutiny of the Mac Arthur policy is needed. But
neither (he Bull Sessions nor the Daily have at
tempted to examine the real import of the Mac-
Arihur question.
The Bull Sessions have drawn blanket conclusions
where no conclusions run be made, due to the pres
ent lack oi adequate knowledge.
We feel that an honest attitude toward Mac Arthur
should be held by the Daily instead of these impul
sively written Bull Sessions, which stimulated this
heated exchange of letters.

swer both to readers Aldrich and Komig, and to
reader Braxton Braggfi who wrote a similar letter
—not published—The Editor.)
(It is your feeling that there has been a "lack of con

sistent leadership shown here at home . . ."
(Others would agree with you. At the same time,
however, they would support the President's dismis
sal on the grounds that it is a solution to what you call
the problem of "a lack of consistent leadership."
(Bull Sessioner Ctisicli moves to support President
Truman. Evidently, you move in the opposite direc
tion. This very conflict of opinion, which is going on
all across the nation, we feel is sufticient definition
of the "real import" of the Mac Arthur question.
(II you would criticize Mr. Cusick, we wovdd suggest
you criticize what he says, not how he says it. II he
has been a victim of drawing "blanket conclusions,"
v/e would appreciate specific examples of same, cou
pled with constructive rebuttal.
(If you would criticize Mr. Grothe for his Bull
Session, we feel you are very foolish. Writer Gro
the's piece dealt very obviously with the almost pa
thetically humorous situation that faced the TV boys
when they had to "fill-in" for one-half hour due to
Mac's late arrival. Mr. Grothe took no sides on the
MacArthur-Truinan conflict.
(We cannot see how your letter is in any way con
structive, You suggest the Daily is dishonest. You
tell us that Bull Sessions by Cusick and Grothe are
"written impulsively." We submit neither statement
is true.
(From what sources, Mesdames, do you draw YOUR
"blanket conclusions?" —The Editor, R.R.)

To ;he Editor:
We deplore the sophoinoric wit displayed by the
Daily Bull Sessions and the heavy sarcasm used by
Mr. Kammen in his letter on the Mac Arthur issue.
Admittedly, there has been a great deal of emotional
fervor shown, which Mr. Kammen would call "bi
zarre"; but this display by the American people is
due, in part, to the lack of consistent leadership shown
here at home. Mac Arthur was a Far-Eastern bulwark
which held the confidence of the people.
We agree with Mr. Kammen that a cool-headed
scrutiny of the Mac Arthur policy is needed. But
neither (he Bull Sessions nor the Daily have at
tempted to examine the real import of the Mac-
Arihur question.
The Bull Sessions have drawn blanket conclusions
where no conclusions run be made, due to the pres
ent lack oi adequate knowledge.
We feel that an honest attitude toward Mac Arthur
should be held by the Daily instead of these impul
sively written Bull Sessions, which stimulated this
heated exchange of letters.
