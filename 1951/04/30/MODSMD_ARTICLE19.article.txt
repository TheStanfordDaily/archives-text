# The 						Crew's Viewpoint

To 1 he Editor:
Fi iday's announcement in the Daily of the proposal
"whereby each fraternity man would contribute 50
cents u month toward support of Stanford's orphan
crew" rniftht be the beginning of another campus-wide
(ontrovtrsy. Since this is the case, it is therefore ap
parent that the Crew's position be made clear.
YVlien the Crew went Kasf to Poughkeepsie two
years ;>ko. it was the first time in years (hat Stan
foid rowed in the National Kegetta on the Hudson.
The story was new and the students gave us en
thusiastic support.
Lust year our Marietta trip was again partially fi
nanced by the generous contributions of the "drive
weary" members of the Stanford Family. However,
this time the news was not unique and we had more
difficulty in obtaining the necessary funds.
We have realized that Stanford students are
plagued with financial drives all through college and
(hat uh» i spring quarter aiives. the campus has had
enough «l these drives in any shape or form.
Thus, last fall we developed a plan to sell honorary
memberships in the Crew Association. We have been
•» lli«!' honoT;ay memberships to all those who have

helped us in the past—our graduate ex-oarsmen and
the friends and alumni of the Crew. So far our drive
has been fairly successful, but we do not have the
necessary funds to make our Washington trip.
The purpose of this plan was to put an end to the
eampus drives and to play down the sentimental
news releases on the "Orphans of Stanford."
The present proposal that the fraternities under
write the Crtw was as much news to us as to the rest
of the student body. The plan was not conceived and
initiated by the oarsmen but by one of the fraternities.
We had no idea that such a plan was being formulated.
Naturally, we would be very happy to have a steady,
secure budget of $>4000 per year, for it would f;o a
long wny toward solving our most urgent problem.
But it is not our policy to coerce anyone info do
nating to (he Crew.
We wish to thank the originators of this plan and
its supporters for their concern over our financial
status; hut we do not want to see anyone forced into
the position of being an unwilling contributor.

news releases on the "Orphans of Stanford."
The present proposal that the fraternities under
write the Crtw was as much news to us as to the rest
of the student body. The plan was not conceived and
initiated by the oarsmen but by one of the fraternities.
We had no idea that such a plan was being formulated.
Naturally, we would be very happy to have a steady,
secure budget of $>4000 per year, for it would f;o a
long wny toward solving our most urgent problem.
But it is not our policy to coerce anyone info do
nating to (he Crew.
We wish to thank the originators of this plan and
its supporters for their concern over our financial
status; hut we do not want to see anyone forced into
the position of being an unwilling contributor.

To 1 he Editor:
Fi iday's announcement in the Daily of the proposal
"whereby each fraternity man would contribute 50
cents u month toward support of Stanford's orphan
crew" rniftht be the beginning of another campus-wide
(ontrovtrsy. Since this is the case, it is therefore ap
parent that the Crew's position be made clear.
YVlien the Crew went Kasf to Poughkeepsie two
years ;>ko. it was the first time in years (hat Stan
foid rowed in the National Kegetta on the Hudson.
The story was new and the students gave us en
thusiastic support.
Lust year our Marietta trip was again partially fi
nanced by the generous contributions of the "drive
weary" members of the Stanford Family. However,
this time the news was not unique and we had more
difficulty in obtaining the necessary funds.
We have realized that Stanford students are
plagued with financial drives all through college and
(hat uh» i spring quarter aiives. the campus has had
enough «l these drives in any shape or form.
Thus, last fall we developed a plan to sell honorary
memberships in the Crew Association. We have been
•» lli«!' honoT;ay memberships to all those who have

helped us in the past—our graduate ex-oarsmen and
the friends and alumni of the Crew. So far our drive
has been fairly successful, but we do not have the
necessary funds to make our Washington trip.
The purpose of this plan was to put an end to the
eampus drives and to play down the sentimental
news releases on the "Orphans of Stanford."
The present proposal that the fraternities under
write the Crtw was as much news to us as to the rest
of the student body. The plan was not conceived and
initiated by the oarsmen but by one of the fraternities.
We had no idea that such a plan was being formulated.
Naturally, we would be very happy to have a steady,
secure budget of $>4000 per year, for it would f;o a
long wny toward solving our most urgent problem.
But it is not our policy to coerce anyone info do
nating to (he Crew.
We wish to thank the originators of this plan and
its supporters for their concern over our financial
status; hut we do not want to see anyone forced into
the position of being an unwilling contributor.
