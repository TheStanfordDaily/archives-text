### 
TOKYO, Monday, April .10 Unit- ;
od Nations forces dug in all alone j
the Korean battlefront today to i
meet an cxpected Communist May j
Day assault tomorrow, and possibly
the biggest battle of the war loomed
above Seoul.
The Chinese Communists poured
fresh troops and supplies into the j
developing battle for the former
capital â€” new. bristling symbol of 1
UN determination to stay and win
the war in Korea.
The Reds threw probing attacks I
into Aliied lines within four miles '
of Seoul from the northwest, north, j
and northeast, but it appeared that
they were not yet ready to launch j
the main attack. Any chance of the
Communists celebrating May Day
in the wrecked capital already had
gone glimmering.
Allied troops above Seoul waited
nervously through the night for the
Kg assault that would begin the
"second round" of the lied counter- :
offensive.
Allied warplancs ranged from the
Manchurian border to the fighting
lines today under brilliant blue
skies. The planes sighted a record
:5..%0 enemy vehicles during the
night more than half of them in
the western sectors.
Air Force and carrier - based
planes added at least an estimated
1,080 enemy casualties yesterday to
the 70,000 that commander Van
Fleet claimed the Reds had suffered
in the first week of their spring of
fensive.
