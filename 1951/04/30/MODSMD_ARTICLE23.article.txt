# HEIFER SESSION

### SUE WHEAT 
Standing in a pre-reg line las) March I became in
volved in a casual conversation.
"Yes, sir," the junior was saying, "spring quarter is
the quarter. Strictly party time. You know, the beach,
Kossott's. and all that." I didn't know but I smiled and
nodded. "So let me clue you—keep the units down
and by all means avoid afternoon classes."
When I walked out I had stood in each line about
four times had made signatures, erasures, and cross
outs on 8/10 of the class lists and was taking Applied
Air Power, Elementary Japanese, Quantitative Analy
sis, and Systematic Herpetology. But it added up to
only 13 units, and they all came in the morning.
The next little piece of advice came from a dormi
tory mate. She was a wise sophomore, a girl genuinely
interested in my welfare:
"Don't forget to send all your skirts and sweaters
and coats home," she told me. "They'll just be clut
tering up your closet winter quarter. And besides,
we'll be wearing nothing but cottons after vacation.
Look how warm it is even now." I was having a Civ
final that afternoon and I agreed that it was very
warm. I also carefully packed my warm clothes in
moth balls and mailed them home.
In my rainy homeland, spring vacation was a week
of sacred preparation for THE quarter at Stanford
University. "A country club," I told my friends, "nes
tled in the green foothills of sunny California." My
family watched in grim disbelief as I purchased bath
ing suits, shorts, sun-dresses, and tennis shoes. I even
had my tennis racket re-strung.
Come spring quarter I am back on the Farm

equipped for 10 weeks of swimming, golf, tennis,
beaching, and eonvertibiling. (So are 7,166 others.)
So what happens?
The first morning I awake, repel my roommate who I
is beating me into consciousness, unci with a gleeful
cry spring from my lop bunk. Limping in to break
fast I hear a rumor: "The sky is grey."
"How silly," I comment, wiping droplets of dew off
my clean cotton dress, "it couldn't be."
I was late to my 8 o'clock that morning. I won't say
it was foggy but I started out five different times, kept
losing sight of familiar landmarks (such as the Main
Libe and Memorial Church) and each time ended up
in the Guggenheim Aerodynamnies Lab. On my sixth
try I happened to hit the corner of Quad and by run
ning one hand along the wall I finally found my class
—Applied Air Power.
Now, four weeks later, I have only one thing to say:
(I and 7,166 others). FOG FOG FOG! COLD COLD
COLD! Is this Stanford's answer to my 13 units and
re-strung tennis racket? And what about the people
who cut the tops off their cars?
My clothes are tired of being worn in layers, my
sneakers are rotting from disuse, and the interior of j
the Civ Libe is becoming entirely too familiar. Be
sides, the door squeaks worse than ever—(undoubt- !
edly due to the high humidity.)
In short, I'm cold!
Afterthought: If this morning happens to be a warm,
bright, sunny one —be it henceforth known that i
journalistically speaking, I m THROUGH. But it was i
worth it. Donations may be forwarded to Key West i
Fia.
