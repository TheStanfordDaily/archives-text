# FOOTBALL SCRIMMAGE
## Reds Upset By Whites Bob Garrett Sparks Win 
### JIM MADISON 
In Saturday's game-style football j
scrimmage a speedy White squad
rudely upset the coaching staff's i
handicapping by soundly thumping i
its Red opponents, 27-14.
Quarterback Bob Garrett and j
halfs Bill Heilbron and Frank Te- !
nerello were major factors of differ
ence in the two teams, as Head [
Coach Chuck Taylor and his staff
had tried to divide their material as
evenly as possible.
The scoring started when on
fourth down the second time they
had the ball, the White linemen let
practically the whole Red forward
wall through, including Tsar Calfee
who blocked fullback Bob Meyers'
attempted kick.
Cooky Barbeau, who played an
alert game all day at defensive left
end, fell on the ball in the end zone
for six Red points. Quarterback
Dick Horn place-kicked the sev
enth.
The Reds scored again after I
another Meyers punt, which was
almost blocked, gave them the ball
on their own 45-yard line. Left
half Wes Laubseher, who was
everything for the Reds that Heil
brown was for the Whites, made
seven and then twelve on two
quick openers over left tackle.
Ron Cool: ai the other half '
smashed for two; fullback Skip J
Crist was stopped cold. Then on a i
trap play Crist was sprung loose (
over right tackle for twenty all the ]
way to the 14-yard line.
Laubseher skirted right end for
eight; then they had to fight harder
for the rest. Cook picked up two
yards. Laubseher was stopped dead
for only one foot. On fourth down
the Whites were offside, moving the s
ball to the one.
Laubseher again made a foot, and
Skip Crist plunged over left tackle
for the score. Gary Kerkorian, who
had marshaled the 55-yard, 11-play
drive — all on the ground — kicked
the conversion.
With the ball on the Red 40 a
few minutes later, Garrett drop
ped back with beautiful decep
tion, saw right end Dud Hersch
hatli in the clear ten yards behind
the nearest defender, then, while
the 500 spectators gaped, threw
him a perfect strike. Herschbach
loped the few steps into the end
zone for the first of four White
touchdowns. Garrett's attempted
conversion was wide.
The Whites struck again on their I

next series of plays. Tackle Len
Kaprelian broke through to smear
Kerkorian attempting to pass. The
latter fumbled the ball, and Kapre
lian scooped it up on about the
thirty.
On the third play, quarterback
Jack Bickel pitched out to his left
to Heilbron, who skirted partially
blocked right end Maurice Twitch
ell, then shifted into high gear to
outrun the secondary for the touch
down. Garrett made his second con
version attempt a good one,
Half Bob Hoegh. a converted end.
scored the third White TD. bucking
off his own right tackle from the
six-yard line to complete a drive
from midfield. Garrett again con
verted.
On another drive from midfield,

Heilbron plunged the final two
yards for his second touchdown of
the day to complete tha TD parade.
Garrett made it 27-14 with his third
straight conversion.
While the team looked weak in
many respects—notablv blocking
and tackling and co-ordinated line
charge, Taylor remarked that "the
squad began to jell; it was the
first time they played as a team."
For individual performances he
singled out veterans Jess Cone and
Leon King for their defensive line
play; Ron Eadie and Barbeau at
defensive ends; Calfee as lineback
er: Norm Manoogian and Owen
Powell on the offensive lines; and
Laubseher, Heilbron, Tenerello, and
Garrett in the offensive backfields.


HE LOOKS FRIENDLY—But many an opposing lineman will
testify "it ain't so." Norm Manoogian, stellar guard on both of
fense and defense on the '50 Card varsity, was one of the stand
out performers in Saturday's intras q uad scrimmage even though
he was on the losing side. Norm, with still two years of elegi
bility left, is picked by many observers as a probable Ail-Amer
ican choice if he continues to improve.
