Stanford s baseball team stayed m j
the current C1BA pennant race by
j coining back to edge UCLA 5 to 4
I Saturday after dropping a 7 to 2
i decision Friday. USC moved back
i into undisputed possession of first
I place by coming from behind to nip
' Cal 7 to 6 in the final inning of a
j game that ended in a driving rain.
Saturday's Bruin - Indian game
| was halted after six innings by the
! rain. Alter half an hour's wait, in
j which Bruin baseball enthusiast
Joe E. Brown came over to the
I Stanford dug-out to discuss the sit-
I uation, the game was called for good.
S as the rain showed no sign of let
ting up.
Bases on halls were the decid
ing factor in Saturday's game as
Bruin Hurler Warren Ilart gave
up eight free passes over the six
innings, while allowing only two
base hits. Hart opened the game !
by walking the first four men to
face him and forcing across a run
without any of the Card batters
taking a cut at the ball. With the
help of a double play, the Bruins
cut the Indians off with only one
more run in the inning.
Stanford moved ahead 3 to 0 in
| the third frame when Dick Clegg ;
1 walked, stole second, and went to j
third on catcher Kenny Moats' bad
throw to second. Clegg tagged up
and came home after Jack Shepard
flied out to center field.
Joe Chez, who opened on the

mound for Stanford, went through
the first four frames, facing only 12 .
men. The only man to reach first '
' base was Buddy Bachtelle, who sin
; yled in the first inning. Bachtelle
j was promptly wiped out on a double
play.
Stanford built up a it to 1 mar
gin in the first half of the sixth
when Shepard walked and Chuck
Essegian drove him home with
Stanford's first hit of the ball
game, a line triple to left center
field. Bill Herron followed with a
single to right, scoring Essegian
with what proved to be the win
ning run.
The Bruins opened up on Chez
i in their half of the sixth with three
! base hits and a pair of walks to
| bring the count to 5 to 4. Relief
hurler Ray O'Connor was able to :
throw only three pitches to Bruce
1 Cameron in the top of the seventh
before plate umpire Ray Stratton
halted the game.
Friday's game was a tight
pitchers' duel between Stanford's
Roger Osenbaugh and UCLA's
Bob MacNeil for six innings with
the only score being a bases
l empty home rim by lJruin third
sacker Buddy Bachtelle in the
third.
! However, the roof fell in in the
j seventh as the Bruins pushed across
five runs on a pair of base hits and

two errors in the Card infield.
MacNeil, who allowed only two i
base raps by the Cards in the first
eight frames, weakened in the ninth
as Clegg opened the inning with a
triple and Shepard followed with a
1400 - foot home run over the left
center field barrier. With one away,
! Dave Rosenkrantz walked, Casta
gnoli singled, and it looked like the
j Indians might have a rally going.
However, MacNeil bore down to get
! the next two batters to fly out.
