# WASHED OUT
## Track Meet Rescheduled For Tonight 
### 
The Stanford - USC spikemeet,
slated for last Saturday, was post
poned until today because of heavy
rains that Hooded the stadium track.
The rescheduled contest will be a
twilight fray, the field events begin
ning at 5:30 and the running events |
at 6.
The Athletic Department voted
the late afternoon contest so that
Peninsula commuters will be able
to see the meet after returning from
work. The new daylight saving time
will permit plenty of light for com
petitors and spectators. The meet
will be over by 7:30, so it shouldn't
interfere with house meetings.
The Trojans learned of the post
ponement just live minutes before
they were to board the northbound
plane.
Assistant Varsity Coach Ray Dean
said he didn't think the change of
dates would affect the outcome of
the meet. Despite the added time
for rest, ailing Card discus star lan
Reed still won't be sufficiently re
covered from his tonsil operation to
compete.
The Trojans will probably have
the services of their discus ace, El
mer Willhoite, who would have
| missed a Saturday tilt because of
an SC football scrimmage.
Dean further said that the Mon
day meet would not hurt the In-

dians' chances in Saturday's Big
Meet with California.
Barring further rains, the stadium
track should be in pretty good
shape by this afternoon. Workers
drilled holes in the track surface
to let the large puddles of water
drain through the thick gravel sub
soil.
The thinclads went through a
light workout Saturday afternoon to
keep limber.
The Trojan cinderfeast will be the
Indians' last home meet of the sea
son. The Cal contest and a series of
relay meets will follow as build-ups
to the nationals in mid-June.
