# Encina Hall, Cracked Ceilings and All, Will Be Open to Everyone This Sunday
## 
### DAVE MEEK 
Encina Hall will open to all for
the first time in its history. The
Encina freshmen are extending
an invitation to everyone for an
open house to be held on Sun
day, May 6, from 2 to 4.
The Encilfa council, with Ron Mc-
Daniel as chairman of the project, is
; planning to offer guided tours and re
-1 freshments. Dick Shooshan's band
| will offer entertainment in the
\ lounge.
Altogether it is a plan to offer every- >
j one the opportunity to see how the
! freshmen live during their year at
Encina.
Encina was one of those first build
! ings that began as a dream, a vision
j of greatness. The plan for the build
i ing was suggested to Mr. Stanford by j
I a favorite hotel in Austria. Since its j
| inception it has stood by to watch
! Stanford grow to its present height
I as a great university.
Clean, varnished, and brand new, j
it opened it doors to enchanted stu
dents who wrote borne about the
food and service, (he dozens of
Chinese attending to their every

want, and compared it to one of the
finest Fifth Avenue hotels. And all
for only $20 a month. This included
all costs for tuition, room, and
hoard,
Today the words of a former presi
dent of Cornell would ring unfa
miliar, "Encina Hall," he said, "is cer
tainly the most beautiful building in
the United States."
Today Encina offers only four bare
walls and the naked necessities of
life. It is the complete antithesis of
that spectacular image that opened
to Herbert Hoover and the early pio
neers, and a synthesis of the different
generations that have lived in Encina
on their way through Stanford. Rem
nants of the past stand with addi
tions of the later generations and
make a curious hybrid mixture.
Straggling networks of wiring,
webbed by human spiders, connect
lamps, radios, heaters, phonographs,
and irons to an old ancient strand of
twisted cord.
Marred desks, carved woodwork,
haltered dressers and lockers and
broken chairs are there. Broken
lines on the walls and ceiling reveal
the spots where the plaster is re
leasing the place it has held for 5!)
years. The list of perennial com
plaints includes ii.adequate heat
in';, ventilation, and plumbing.
Despite all this, many of the fresh
men try to make the most of it. Fur
niture is artistically arranged and
the walls are invariably covered with
posters, pin-ups and souvenirs. The

more enterprising obtain articles of j
furnishings from home.
But a reckless and careless attitude j
overshadows these attempts to make
it more liveable. At one time the di- j
rector of one of the other dorms rep- |
rimanded the students in a wing for
exploding a firecracker with "I won't s
tolerate the actions and reputation |
that Encina freshmen are noted for." j
Why should Encina have this
reputation? Encina freshmen seem
to he the fulfillment of the maxim,
"If he had a brain, he'd he dan- 1
gerous."
A story familiar at Encina is that \
students once succeeded in slipping
the parts of a dismantled Model T
into one of the rooms, Piece by piece j
they assembled it and then attempted
to ram it through a wall.
There is also the tale that couple |
of freshmen led a bewildered cow
into one of the rooms while every- I
one was on a vacation during the |
school year. There they supplied it
with all the hay it could eat. and
closed the door. When the occupants
of the room returned they discov
ered a cow that had grown too big
for the door. Unfortunately it had
to be shot and dissected.
Enema's repucation today docs
not center in a lack of authority or
leadership. Mrs. Ellenc Sumner, j
resident director of Encina, >s doing
a very commendable job consider
ing unfavorable circumstances j
working against her. The condi
tions at the hall incite a sense of
carelessness and indifference.
