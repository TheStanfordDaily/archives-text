# ATHLETIC FUNDS
## Board Adopts Budget 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Stanford's budget-weary ath
letic board ended two months of
adding and subtracting Satur
day morning by adopting a
budget of 5549,355 for the '51-
'52 school year.
The tally sheet will be sent to j
President Wallace Sterling and the
Board of Trustees immediately for
final approval and possible revisions.
The nine-man hoard had done j
what seemed earlier to be an almost
impossible task — that of balancing
heavy revenues as against expendi
tures that were even heavier.
In what promises to be the largest
yearly budget since the war —and the
second largest in Stanford's athletic
history—members met the challenge
by:
1. Boosting revenues more than i
$!).000 by an increase in membership
fees of the Stanford Golf Course from
$145 to $200. and by jacking up "to i
the near limit" other revenues pre- 1
viousl.v estimated at lower amounts.
2. Slashing expenses $20,000 by
eliminating the Stanford Riding;
School from its long line of subsidy
costs, cutting out. projected stadium
! repairs, and by effecting successively
smaller cuts in other items. It is ex- i
pectcd that the Riding School will be
operated individually under a con
tract basis next year, pending Board
of Trustees' approval.
Co-Rec Shelved
In other action, the board post
i poned decision on a budget, allow
a nee of $250 to the newly-born Co-
Recreation Committee. Granting of
| the money will hinge on addition in- !
formation to "justify the appropria- i
tion."
It was expected that final action on |
this matter would he taken at the
board's next meeting in early June.
A trio of Stanford teams — golf,
track, and tennis — will compete in
NCAA tournaments this year, as the i
board approved the necessary trav
eling and living-away expenses.
Top track competitors from the
Farm will make the trip to Seattle
June 14 and 15, while the golf and
tennis teams will travel to Ohio State
and Northwestern respectively at the
quarter's end for their meets.
Just who will represent Stanford
at the competitions will he un to the
individual coaches and the Director
of Athletics.
"Optimistic View"
Devoting the majority of meeting
time to next year's budget, Board
Chairman Louis Vincenti summed up
the results of the Finance Commit
| tec's budget recommendations when
| he said, "We have taken a very op
! timistic view of income . . ." in order
I to balance the ledger.
The only items which might exceed
revenue expectations are football
gate receipts, which vary with the
success —or failure —of the team.
Vincenti indicated.
The board reversed its previous de
cision to repaint the stadium this
summer, due to high costs and the
"temporary" nature of .such improve
ment "it would have to be done again
in two years."
Crew Talks Going On
Both Vincenti and Athletic Direc
tor A 1 Masters reported they had in
vestigated the situation and discov
ered it. would cast between $"0,000
and $50,000 to sand and repaint the
arena. Two years ago, when re
painting was last undertaken, the
• cost was $12,000.
Vincenti sairl further investigation

of both the stadium and the repair
of the Sunken Diamond grandstand
would be forthcoming.
At present representatives of the
Board are conferring with Dr. Stea
ling on a possible solution t.o the
problem of University supervision
and sponsorship of the Stanford
Crew. Vincenti said a decision on this
matter "would he an important item
on the June agenda meeting."

eling and living-away expenses.

"Optimistic View"
Devoting the majority of meeting
time to next year's budget, Board
Chairman Louis Vincenti summed up
the results of the Finance Commit
| tec's budget recommendations when
| he said, "We have taken a very op
! timistic view of income . . ." in order
I to balance the ledger.
The only items which might exceed
revenue expectations are football
gate receipts, which vary with the
success —or failure —of the team.
Vincenti indicated.
The board reversed its previous de
cision to repaint the stadium this
summer, due to high costs and the
"temporary" nature of .such improve
ment "it would have to be done again
in two years."
Crew Talks Going On
Both Vincenti and Athletic Direc
tor A 1 Masters reported they had in
vestigated the situation and discov
ered it. would cast between $"0,000
and $50,000 to sand and repaint the
arena. Two years ago, when re
painting was last undertaken, the
• cost was $12,000.
Vincenti sairl further investigation

of both the stadium and the repair
of the Sunken Diamond grandstand
would be forthcoming.
At present representatives of the
Board are conferring with Dr. Stea
ling on a possible solution t.o the
problem of University supervision
and sponsorship of the Stanford
Crew. Vincenti said a decision on this
matter "would he an important item
on the June agenda meeting."
Stanford's budget-weary ath
letic board ended two months of
adding and subtracting Satur
day morning by adopting a
budget of 5549,355 for the '51-
'52 school year.
The tally sheet will be sent to j
President Wallace Sterling and the
Board of Trustees immediately for
final approval and possible revisions.
The nine-man hoard had done j
what seemed earlier to be an almost
impossible task — that of balancing
heavy revenues as against expendi
tures that were even heavier.
In what promises to be the largest
yearly budget since the war —and the
second largest in Stanford's athletic
history—members met the challenge
by:
1. Boosting revenues more than i
$!).000 by an increase in membership
fees of the Stanford Golf Course from
$145 to $200. and by jacking up "to i
the near limit" other revenues pre- 1
viousl.v estimated at lower amounts.
2. Slashing expenses $20,000 by
eliminating the Stanford Riding;
School from its long line of subsidy
costs, cutting out. projected stadium
! repairs, and by effecting successively
smaller cuts in other items. It is ex- i
pectcd that the Riding School will be
operated individually under a con
tract basis next year, pending Board
of Trustees' approval.

In other action, the board post
i poned decision on a budget, allow
a nee of $250 to the newly-born Co-
Recreation Committee. Granting of
