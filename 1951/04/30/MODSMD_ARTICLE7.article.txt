# Peace Is Through UN, Says Bunche; Model Assembly Faces Surprise Issue
## UN to Succeed Says Diplomat 
### 
Founding his hope for the future j
on the freedom - loving peoples of j
the world and the potentality of the i
United Nations, Dr. Ralph Bunche j
told the 2,00 ft persons who over- j
flowed Memorial Auditorium Sat- i
urday night that if "there is to be J
security for any peace ... it must J
come through the UN or not at all." ,
The 47-year-old diplomat cau- j
tioncd against appraising the UN on j
the shallow and fickle basis of the
ups and downs of United Nations j
military fortunes in Korea.
Criticizing the advocates of a .
cheap road to security embodied in
neo - isolationism, Dr. Bunche cm- j
phasized that, "security is a matter j
of friends" as well as armaments.
There is no easy road to peace, he
said. It requires patient effort, a j
process of trial and error, sacrifices
on the part of each individual, and j
confidence in the people's organiza- '
tion for peace—the UN.
Television lights flooded the stage :
| and the auditorium overfilled with
delegates to the UN Model Assem- j
blv, Stanford students and faculty, j
as Dr. Bunche pointed out the re
sponsibility of the U.S. to show a
democracy we live by as well as j
| swear by.
"We cannot, have two brands of ]
democracy," he said, " —a pure or
first quality for export, and an im
perfect, factory-second quality for
home consumption."
Dr. Bunche warned that we must
purge ourselves of undemocratic ra
i rial and religious bigotries at home
before we can preach democracy
| abroad.
Emphasizing that "free people
i constitute the best and only insur
ance against war," Dr. Bunche said
i universal human freedom is the
means for world security. "Free
| peoples will fight, if need be, to pro
j tect their freedom, but they will
not, in this enlightened age, initiate

aggressive war.
Dr. Bunche stressed the role of
the United Nations in obtaining a
peaceful world, and the responsibil- !
ity of the U.S. to prove our friend- i
.-hip by accepting and treating all
peoples as equals, throughout his
address.
Assuring the audience that the
UN is doing and will continue to do
everything possible to preserve both
peace and freedom. Dr. Bunche ex
pressed his belief that "the UN can
and will succeed" despite the proph
ets of doom.
Dr. Bunchc's "address climaxed the !
three-day session of the UN Model
Assembly which was held at Stan
ford. At the beginning of his talk,
Dr. Bunche, who presided over the
Model Assembly, complimented the
student delegations for their real
istic and intelligent participation at
the Model Assembly.
