# 'Keep Fighting in Korea Localized' U.N. Military Policy, Declares Bunch
## 
### 
Describing the purpose of UN
troops in Korea as a "holding ac
tion," Dr. Ralph Bunche, director
of the UN Trusteeship Division, told
reporters at a press conference Fri
day that there has been no intent
of an all-out effort in Korea.
Although the political objectives
in Korea have been clearly defined
by the UN, Dr. Bunche explained,
military objectives haven't been
clear. "The whole purpose of the
UN in Korea, if it. couldn't stop the
fighting from breaking out, has been
to keep the fighting localized so that
it. wouldn't expand into a third
World War."
This limited military objective,

which Dr. Bunche termed a "hold
ing action," is difficult for people to
hecome accustomed to — there are
losses without any pparent gain.
Dr. Bunche warned that there
may have to be "holding actions" in
the future, and although such action
is not thrilling, it is the only prac
tical course to keep fighting from
spreading.
Korea Settlement
When asked what the UN would
consider as an honorable settlement
in Korea, Dr. Bunche outlined the
following terms: (1) cease-fire; (2)
negotiations for a united, unified
Korea—north and south; (3) the re
moval of all troops.

As fur the eventuality of such a j
settlement, Dr. Bunche described the ;
attitude in the UN as neither opti
mistic nor pessimistic, but realistic— |
"We .shall keep working patiently as j
we have in other dark situations."
Dr. Bunche emphasized that the
UN did not seek appeasement but j
an end to the war, if possible, j
through negotiations—the UN v/ill 1
continue intervening if peaceful i
means don't succeed.
Korean Problem Different
The Korean situation differs from i
other courses of UN intervention.
Dr. Bunche pointed out. It was the j
first time the UN had to use force, I
since it couldn't get both parties to j
sit down and reach a peaceful set- !
tlement.
If the UN had taken no action on j
Korea, he said, the organization
would now be just an academic sub
ject. without moral foundation.
Dr. Bunche said we have moved I
nearer to a permanent UN force, i
and if such a force had been avail - '
able last June," chances are, there i
would have been no Korean ag- i
gression." As it was, the UN had to J
improvise, and has been improvis- ;
ing ever since.
Mac Arthur Issue
Declining to speak on the Mac A
rthur issue, since he is a representa- j
tive of the UN, and that is "strictly !
an American affair," Dr. Bunche in- j
terjected a hit of humor during the
conference with the following rr- j
ply to a question on the general's ]
removal:
"If you're asking if there was a
sigh of relief, I can only say that
our now Manhattan building has so j
much sway, it's hard to tell whether
(here was a movement of the build
ing from the wind or from a sigh."
Dr. Bunche gave a vigorous "no"
to a question on the reorganization
of the UN excluding Russia. The
Nobel Peace Prize winner said that
such a move would he contrary to
the purpose of the UN, and would
bo the prelude to war.
"The UN was established to pro
vide an avenue for nations with
differences to get together," the
doctor pointed out. By excluding
nations with differences, the pur
pose of the UN would be defeated.
In answer to other pending ques
; l ions such as Formosa and the ad -
mission of Communist China to the
UN, Dr. Bunche said these questions
would he held in abeyance as long
as Chinese Communist, forces re
main in the Korean conflict. Ho ex
plained that the Japanese peace
treaty would not come before the
, UN as it was strictly an American
; proposition.
