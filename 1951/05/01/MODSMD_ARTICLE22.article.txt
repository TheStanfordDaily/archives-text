# History of Charity Drive Dates Back to Year 1923
## 
### RALPH HANDY 
Out near San Francisquito Creek, south of
Menlo and north of the Cactus Garden, there's
a small cluster of buildings that abbreviation
conscious Stanford likes to call its "Con Home."

And that's what all next week's
whoop-te-do is going to he about—
Men's Council labor camp, the Stan
ford Convalescent Home. Tag Day,
tho car washes, the Strawberry
Brunch, the soliciting, the kins? and
queen contest, the Sophomore C ;nni
val—all with one purpose in mind, to
provide the wherewithal to keep four
! Con Home beds for a year at some
j thing better than $5 a day.
Set up in 1920, the Con Home has
operated since that time on a charity
basis, depending on donations from
various groups for its continued op
eration.
In addition to the Stanford contri
bution, the Menlo Circus Cluk, the
San Francisco Community Cher;!, the
Elks Club, Rotary, and various Fen
j insula women's auxiliaries work to
| keep the Con Home going.
Senator Stanford's Home
Part of the Con Home is Senator
Stanford's summer home that ha
I been converted to a three-ward "rf
j cuperation" hospital for needy
! youngsters. There are three other
units that have been donated by
! various benefactors throughout th •
j years.
The Con Home kids are 4-to-1.2-
' year-olds sent from Bay Area clinics
I to the Stanford Farm to convalesce
after bouts with rheumatic fever and
j respiratory infections. The average
stay is eight months to a year.
Patients are divided into two
! groups, the bed unit and the "run
about" unit. "Runabouts" are chil
dren almost ready to go home, and
thf\y are just as their name implies.
The Con Home's 26 acres provide
plenty of elbow room and there is a
' playground with slides and swings, a
j tree house, and a playhouse. Scout
ing is also a part of the Con Home
j program to let the patients grow up
j normally. There are active Brown it
j and an A Phi O-sponsored Cub pack.
School time
But its not all play. Not even in
: the Con Home can the kids escape tho
I schoolmarm. It's four hours a day
j for "runabouts" and bed patients
! alike. And report cards, too. A
! weekly non-denominational Sunday
school is also conducted.
Stanford students first began to
I take a financial interest in the Con
Home 28 years ago. Since then nu
merous fund-raising schemes hav
appeared. In 1933. Bean Day was ini
i tiated; students ate beans and apple
for lunch and the 30 cents per meal
saved was donated to tho Con Home.
This worked two ways, for the Straw
berry Brunch was held in the after
! noon and the Con Home undoubtedly
j benefited again from empty stomachs,
j An air show wa.-; incorporated in
the Con Home drive in 1937.
In 1949, a special Memorial Audi
torium showing of "Gone With the
Wind" swelled the Con Home drive
I treasury.

Senator Stanford's Home
Part of the Con Home is Senator
Stanford's summer home that ha
I been converted to a three-ward "rf
j cuperation" hospital for needy
! youngsters. There are three other
units that have been donated by
! various benefactors throughout th •
j years.
The Con Home kids are 4-to-1.2-
' year-olds sent from Bay Area clinics
I to the Stanford Farm to convalesce
after bouts with rheumatic fever and
j respiratory infections. The average
stay is eight months to a year.
Patients are divided into two
! groups, the bed unit and the "run
about" unit. "Runabouts" are chil
dren almost ready to go home, and
thf\y are just as their name implies.
The Con Home's 26 acres provide
plenty of elbow room and there is a
' playground with slides and swings, a
j tree house, and a playhouse. Scout
ing is also a part of the Con Home
j program to let the patients grow up
j normally. There are active Brown it
j and an A Phi O-sponsored Cub pack.
School time
But its not all play. Not even in
: the Con Home can the kids escape tho
I schoolmarm. It's four hours a day
j for "runabouts" and bed patients
! alike. And report cards, too. A
! weekly non-denominational Sunday
school is also conducted.
Stanford students first began to
I take a financial interest in the Con
Home 28 years ago. Since then nu
merous fund-raising schemes hav
appeared. In 1933. Bean Day was ini
i tiated; students ate beans and apple
for lunch and the 30 cents per meal
saved was donated to tho Con Home.
