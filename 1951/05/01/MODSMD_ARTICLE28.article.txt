# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
it's so very easy to become wrapped up with Stan
lord 'ocial activities, sports, and the like that we often
lose sight of the real reason why we're at college.
I found that out when I attended last week's Model
UN and the recent "Crisis and You" conference.

I though) I might get some good
Hull Session material by taking in
(he UN session. What with Turks,
Russians, Americans, Arabs, and
half a hundred other nationalities
busying around and spitting fire
i ach other, I thought I could
• lean some material at which we
could all laugh. And some funny
things did happen, such as George
Vclliotes, the poor man's Molotov,
refusing to have a photog from a
I fcai'sl paper snap a picture of him,

if(i( from the outset a was evident that the pur
pose for which .'550 delegates from 5!) colleges gath
»-i (1 was a sobering one. It was a serious purpose
in one of the most serious of all times, and mi insig
nificant Bull Sessioner in liis right mind would try
to ,foi;ce humor out of it.
I thought as I watched the interested eyes of the
SUtdfijd students around me that maybe the 220 bucks
tuition that they (and I) had to shell out wasn't
wasted after all. Maybe there was some hope for

this battered old world if students traveled hundreds |
of miles to attend a Model UN and do their share to j
further democracy.
Most of us worry about the draft, about the possi
bility of a third World War, and about the encroach- j
nient on democracy-loving peoples, but we "haven't !
got the time to sit in on some stuffy meeting" and find
out where our responsibility in the world crisis lies.
Maybe all this sounds hackneyed, so hear the in
spiring words of I)r. Kalph Bundle: "We can't em
ploy a first-quality democracy for export and an im
perfect. factory-second quality for home consump
tion. —Democracy is being severely challenged. To !
meet that challenge we must give a convincing dem
onstration of democracy at work: we must show that j
democracy is something we live by as well as swear
by."
1 am reminded of a biting cartoon by Bill Mauldin.
It depicts a dilapidated old shack in a littered, miser
able setting. On the door is a sign saying, "Westside j
Country Club, C°hned Gentlemen Only." From the j
inside come the words, "I unnerstand our congress- !
men are worrying about democracy in the Balkans." j
Those who attended the recently-concluded Mode!
UN "were worrying about democracy in the Balkans," !
but more important they were working toward a
"first-quality democracy for home consumption" as
well as for "export."
