To the Editor:
As one reader who was much impressed with "The
i itK-Jvirig—Horse Winner," ... 1 could not let Messrs.
Hemming and Buckleys review go by unanswered.
My first impression was the perfect job done in por
traying English life, even to the smallest detail. This
skill made enjoyable for me the "dull stretches" men
tioned 4n Wednesday's review.
My other salient impression was the sensitive, fine
performance given by the boy. I li«ed in England
for several months recently in a family with a 12-
year-old boy, and the similarities between the two
children were very marked.
As your reviewers apparently do not know, an Eng
lish boy of about 12 (as I imagine the boy in the film
w;i« meant to be) would certainly be interested in a
rocking horse. At that the age the nursery and its
activities are still an important part of an English boy's
life, a very different life from that of an American hoy
<j| the same age.
Although the picture will now have left Menlo Park,
I hope that another viewpoint may help to persuade
others to see this film if it returns, and to enjoy it as
much as 1 did.
