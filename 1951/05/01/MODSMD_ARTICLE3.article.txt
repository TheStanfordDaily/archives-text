# Hush Investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Senate investi
gators decided today by an almost
straight party line vote to start their
dramatic investigation into Gen.
Douglas Mac-Arthur's ouster as Tar
Eastern commander behind closed
doors.
But they held out the possibility
of public hearings later and Sen.
Richard B. Russell, D., Ga., chairman
of the group, said transcripts of the
hearings will be given newsmen after
all military secrets have been i
screened out.
The key vote was 14 to 9, with Sen.
Charles W. Tobey, R.. N.H., joining a j
solid bloc of Democrats in opposing 1
a Republican resolution demanding I
that the sessions be thrown open to
the public.
