# Encina Broadcasters

To the Editor:
Before the sponsors do pounce on us, let's clear up
a little matter which was reported in Monday's Daily
("Sponsors Stop Frosh Radio"). Derek Bok, the head
sponsor, was in 333 (Encina Hall) for about five min
utes listening to the broadcast and investigating to
determine who was waterbagging our audience gath
ered in the courtyard below.
He made no attempt to halt the broadcast, nor did
any other sponsor. Our announcer, an import from
XEKB, went out of Ins head for a moment. We are
not permanently washed-up as many had thought;
we are temporarily out of business because of an
en masse raid by the Encina cooks and janitors, who
were represented in our program, "Workers Arise
—You Bums."
KZFU will return to the air within the next two
weeks with the blessings of the Encina sponsors, who
are not really as iron-fisted as the article intimated.
