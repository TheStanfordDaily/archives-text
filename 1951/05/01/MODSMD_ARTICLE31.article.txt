# Ninety Per Cent of Farm Men Will Pass Draft Test, Stanford Center Estimates
## 
### 
Close to 90 per cent of Stan
ford undergraduate men should
be able to earn a score of 70 or
above on the forthcoming Selec
tive Service College Qualifica
tion Test, according to informa
tion just compiled by the Stan
ford Counseling and Testing
Center. This means that nine out
of ten Farm roughs who take the
test should win recommenda
tions for deferment.
."Careful estimates indicate that
vii'l u.'illy all Stanford juniors, nine
oul of ten sophomores, and better
Ih.-i.n t ij.;h t out of ten freshmen
luiiild pass the test if tiie informa
tion wt have on it is correct," Di
li* for John D. Black of the Coun

seling Center said.
Estimates were based on Selec
tive Service Director Ilershey's
announcement that scores of 70
on the draft test will equal 'the
average score made by the college I
freshmen who take the A.C.E.
Psychological Examination."
Although the A.C.E. examination
is not routinely administered to J
Stanford students, the Counseling I
Center recently secured and ana
lyzed the scores of a 20 per cent
sample of Stanford freshmen, Black
explained.
Toe Counseling Center study also
indicates that about G5 per cent of
Stanford freshmen should receive;
scores on the Selective Service test j
which qualify them to enter gradu
ate or professional schools under
existing draft recommendations. 1
Percentage of the upper classes re- j

ceiving such scores should be much
higher.
The Counseling Center's study
of the A.C.E. examination was
part of a large-scale research in
vestigation of various psychologi
cal tests appropriate in counseling
Stanford students. Formerly re
stricted to veterans, the Center
began providing vocational and
personal counseling to all students
last fall.
Administration of the Selective
Service College Qualification Test
will begin May 2(5 and will be re
peated June 1(5 and '30. The Coun
seling Center expects to test 1.000
students on each of the tirst two
dates. Men who have not yet ap
plied to take the test were urged to
do so immediately by Richard L.
Balch, Chief Counselor for Men.
Applications are available at the
San Jose draft board.

seling Center expects to test 1.000
students on each of the tirst two

Close to 90 per cent of Stan
ford undergraduate men should
be able to earn a score of 70 or
above on the forthcoming Selec
tive Service College Qualifica
tion Test, according to informa
tion just compiled by the Stan
ford Counseling and Testing
Center. This means that nine out
of ten Farm roughs who take the
test should win recommenda
tions for deferment.
."Careful estimates indicate that
vii'l u.'illy all Stanford juniors, nine
oul of ten sophomores, and better
Ih.-i.n t ij.;h t out of ten freshmen
luiiild pass the test if tiie informa
tion wt have on it is correct," Di
li* for John D. Black of the Coun

seling Center said.
Estimates were based on Selec
tive Service Director Ilershey's
announcement that scores of 70
on the draft test will equal 'the
average score made by the college I
freshmen who take the A.C.E.
Psychological Examination."
Although the A.C.E. examination
is not routinely administered to J
Stanford students, the Counseling I
Center recently secured and ana
lyzed the scores of a 20 per cent
sample of Stanford freshmen, Black
explained.
Toe Counseling Center study also
indicates that about G5 per cent of
Stanford freshmen should receive;
scores on the Selective Service test j
which qualify them to enter gradu
ate or professional schools under
existing draft recommendations. 1
Percentage of the upper classes re- j

ceiving such scores should be much
higher.
The Counseling Center's study
of the A.C.E. examination was
part of a large-scale research in
vestigation of various psychologi
cal tests appropriate in counseling
Stanford students. Formerly re
stricted to veterans, the Center
began providing vocational and
personal counseling to all students
last fall.
