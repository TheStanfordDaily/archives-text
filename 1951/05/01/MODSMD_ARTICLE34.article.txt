## Music Performance 'Charms' Reviewer 
### ART BLOOMFIELD 
The Music Department's chamber
music series continued its' excur
sions into the relatively unknown
reaches of literature when a con
cert of seventeenth-century English
music was given in honor of Richard
Foster Jones Sunday afternoon at
Cubberley Auditorium.
There was much that was charm
ing on the program and nothing
more so than Orlando Gibbons' imi
tative Fantasia 011 "The Cryes of
London," which are the familiar
sounds of street peddlers hawking
their wares.
Tne piece, which is actually based
on Gregorian chant, is a good exam
ple of what secular music can be
come when put in a new context.
It was given a rousing performance
by conductor Sandor Salgo, a string
ensemble, and Herbert Nanney's
University Singers, who distin
guished themselves by their clear
enunciation, good intonation, and
peppy delivery.
Voice Narratives
Another pleasing element on the
program was a performance of songs
by Henry Lawes from a masque,
"Comus," with verse-narrative by
Milton. One was taken, vicariously
at least, into the atmosphere of the
seventeenth century as the work
was presented in the costume of the
time, with comments spoken from

the stage in the seventeenth-cen
tury language.
The participants were soprano
Yvonne Chauveau, who sang with
a pleasing voice and a mostly in
offensive vibrato; Edward Linck,
who inflected Milton's lines in grand
rhetorical style, and Putnam Al
drich, who was his usual authori
tative self at the harpsichord.
Comic Numbers
Miss Chauveau and Mr. Aldrich
were also involved in another West
Coast premiere, that of Henry Pur
cell's last composition, Altisidora's
scene from "Don Quixote," music
which displays the versatile Eng
lishman's lighter nature.
A distinct contrast to this excerpt
from a "comical history, a burlesque
of Cervantes," was Purcell's more
sober and intellectual Fantasia upon
one note (the one note being a C
sustained in one part throughout
the piece), which was given a mel
low sounding performance by Mr.
Salyo and the string ensemble. The
same group also played a quiet,
heartfelt Pavane, "Lachrimae Anti
quae," and a more incisive Galliard
for the King of Denmark.

sustained in one part throughout
the piece), which was given a mel
low sounding performance by Mr.
Salyo and the string ensemble. The
same group also played a quiet,
heartfelt Pavane, "Lachrimae Anti
quae," and a more incisive Galliard
for the King of Denmark.
The Music Department's chamber
music series continued its' excur
sions into the relatively unknown
reaches of literature when a con
cert of seventeenth-century English
music was given in honor of Richard
Foster Jones Sunday afternoon at
Cubberley Auditorium.
There was much that was charm
ing on the program and nothing
more so than Orlando Gibbons' imi
tative Fantasia 011 "The Cryes of
London," which are the familiar
sounds of street peddlers hawking
their wares.
Tne piece, which is actually based
on Gregorian chant, is a good exam
ple of what secular music can be
come when put in a new context.
It was given a rousing performance
by conductor Sandor Salgo, a string
ensemble, and Herbert Nanney's
University Singers, who distin
guished themselves by their clear
enunciation, good intonation, and
peppy delivery.
Voice Narratives
Another pleasing element on the
program was a performance of songs
by Henry Lawes from a masque,
"Comus," with verse-narrative by
Milton. One was taken, vicariously
at least, into the atmosphere of the
seventeenth century as the work
was presented in the costume of the
time, with comments spoken from

the stage in the seventeenth-cen
tury language.
The participants were soprano
Yvonne Chauveau, who sang with
a pleasing voice and a mostly in
offensive vibrato; Edward Linck,
who inflected Milton's lines in grand
rhetorical style, and Putnam Al
drich, who was his usual authori
tative self at the harpsichord.
Comic Numbers
Miss Chauveau and Mr. Aldrich
were also involved in another West
Coast premiere, that of Henry Pur
cell's last composition, Altisidora's
scene from "Don Quixote," music
which displays the versatile Eng
lishman's lighter nature.
A distinct contrast to this excerpt
from a "comical history, a burlesque
of Cervantes," was Purcell's more
sober and intellectual Fantasia upon
one note (the one note being a C
sustained in one part throughout
the piece), which was given a mel
low sounding performance by Mr.
Salyo and the string ensemble. The
same group also played a quiet,
heartfelt Pavane, "Lachrimae Anti
quae," and a more incisive Galliard
for the King of Denmark.
