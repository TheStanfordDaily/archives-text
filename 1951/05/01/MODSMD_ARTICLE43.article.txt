# Cards Rally, But Lose to Troy
## Taylor, Jiles Score Upsets 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
In a cold, windy twilight track [
meet held in spacious Stanford Sta
, dium, Stanford's varsity trackmen
i put up a game light before suc
; cumbing to USC's track horde, 81'j ;
to 49 7,112.
The underdog Indians came with
| in a third of a point of their 50- !
j point "moral victory" goal, and ac- j
! tually outscored the powerful rlro
i jans in the field events by 1 [ /\
| points.
Sprinter Wilbur Taylor and
high jumper Norm Jiles t»f the
Indians scored stunning upsets in
the "icebox" meet. Captain Tay- |
lor came from behind to win the
100-ya.d dash by a chest in 9.9
seconds, and then came roaring
back to take tlie 220 in 22.1.
Troy's favored sprinter A 1 Mejia j
was second in both races.
The amazing Jiles, who wasn't j
figured to score a single point in J
the high jump, won the event at 6 ft, I
in. and then unofficially cleared
6 ft. 4 1 ii in. and G ft. 5 Vis in. for good j
measure. SC's favored high jump j
trio, Jack Barnes, Dick Brombach, i
j and Manuel Ronquillo, each of
whom clears (i ft.'4 in. regularly, had j
to be satisfied with a tie for second
i at 6 ft. 3 in.
Another surprise was Card :
Wally McCumant's fast finish
which earned him second place in I
! a thrilling half-mile. McCamant,
who had barely broken two min
utes on only one occasion this |
I season, was unofficially timed at
1:57. Boh Mitchell of the Trojans
won the race irn 1:56 8.
On his last jump, Stanford's Mer
ritt Van Sant, who has been both- |
ered with a sore leg, forged ahead j
: of Trojan Frank Flores to win the
broad jump. Van Sant's 23-ft. 8-in. j
mark was a scant two inches ahead
of his rival. Pete McKay of the In
dians took third at 22 ft. lIV 2 in.
Indians Bob Mathias, Chuck
Renfro, and Frank Bradley swept
\ ihe discus, but the Trojans came
back to take the relay by two
yards. In the thrilling relay, an
chor man Bill Storum made up
about eight yards on Troy's ace
Verle Sorgen, and was timed in
48.(! seconds for the lap.
In the two - mile, Troy's Jim 1
(Chief) Newcomb loafed through i
the first four laps in 5:01 and then
turned on the gas in the last four [
to win in 9:39. Stanford's Bob Si
mon took second.
