Advice to Chuck Taylor Dept.
Chuck, you may have a potential
All-American halfback in Len Ka
prelian, economy-size tackie.
In last Saturday's intra - squad
scrimmage, big Len picked up a
loose l'umble and earthquaked his
250 pounds to the goal. A 30-yard
jaunt. Fullback Skip Crist, who
j'ave chase, couldn't catch up with
him. Unfortunately, the refs called
back the touchdown romp, because a
defensive man can't pick up a fum
ble and run with it.
Kaprelian made all-conference in
his JC league before transferring to
Stanford last year where he played
reserve tackle. Last „ season, his
playing weight was 2G5 pounds. He
was clued, however, that he didn't
exactly have a girlish figure, so he
went down to 250. A mere shadow
of his former self.
Watch out for this Kaprelian. He's
,"ot atomic possibilities.

Crime Dept. Some thief made a !
nice haul last Saturday.
While the boys were footballing it
up. he got into the locker room and
cleaned out most of the players'
wallets. The only ones to escape I
were the refs, who had their bill
folds in their pockets.
Guard Phil Wilson, who was sep
arated from $30, exclaimed, "That
damn guy didn't even leave me a |
nickel for a phone call."

hauser at practice. Griffin explained i
that he wouldn't be able to go out !
lor practice that day because fie had
a lab. Coach Jack excused him, but
as the two - miler walked away,
Weiershauser asked him, "Say, you

not I."
As soon as George and his friends

Consideration Dept. George Grif
fin, a two-miler on the track team, j
is a considerate guy.
A few weeks back Griffin gave
forth with a stoic performance for
Coach Jack Weiershauser. who at
the time was plagued with injury !
troubles.
Griffin and a friend (who was us- I
ing crutches) approached Weiers
hauser at practice. Griffin explained i
that he wouldn't be able to go out !
lor practice that day because fie had
a lab. Coach Jack excused him, but
as the two - miler walked away,
Weiershauser asked him, "Say, you
aren't limping, are you?"
George replied, "Limping? No, j
not I."
As soon as George and his friends

I
were out of distance, his friend re- j
turned the crutches to their right
ful owner.
Advice to Chuck Taylor Dept.
Chuck, you may have a potential
All-American halfback in Len Ka
prelian, economy-size tackie.
In last Saturday's intra - squad
scrimmage, big Len picked up a
loose l'umble and earthquaked his
250 pounds to the goal. A 30-yard
jaunt. Fullback Skip Crist, who
j'ave chase, couldn't catch up with
him. Unfortunately, the refs called
back the touchdown romp, because a
defensive man can't pick up a fum
ble and run with it.
Kaprelian made all-conference in
his JC league before transferring to
Stanford last year where he played
reserve tackle. Last „ season, his
playing weight was 2G5 pounds. He
was clued, however, that he didn't
exactly have a girlish figure, so he
went down to 250. A mere shadow
of his former self.
Watch out for this Kaprelian. He's
,"ot atomic possibilities.

Crime Dept. Some thief made a !
nice haul last Saturday.
While the boys were footballing it
up. he got into the locker room and
cleaned out most of the players'
wallets. The only ones to escape I
were the refs, who had their bill
folds in their pockets.
Guard Phil Wilson, who was sep
arated from $30, exclaimed, "That
damn guy didn't even leave me a |
nickel for a phone call."
