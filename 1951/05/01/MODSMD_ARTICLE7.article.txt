### JOY HAAS 
"I've signed dozens of oaths since I've been in public office,
! and I'm opposed to these people who refuse to sign loyalty oaths," I
Assemblyman Albert Stewar, (R), Los Angeles, informed a group
of college students who buttonholed him during a recess of the
Assembly in Sacramento yesterday.
A group of students from Stanford joined with 70 other student J

j crusaders from all over the state and
! took their pleas for academic free-
I dom, civil liberties, and teacher ten
j ure to the legislators in person.
High on the list of "must sees." |
drawn up by amateur lobbyists was
' new Assemblyman Charles E. Chapel
) (R), Los Angeles. The students were
! united in their opposition to Chapel's j
j hill AB-2616 which is almost iden
i tical to Senator Jack Tenney's bill
I providing measures for removal of
j any person employed in the public
: school system "for utterance of any
treasonable words or words, or the
! doing of any treasonable act or acts." i
Enforcement
The Chapel bill, however, provides j
| that the enforcement of academic i
; conduct be assumed by tne ?o»te Do-
I partment of Justice, instead of by the
Department of Education as specified
| in the Tenney bill.
When asked to state his position on
! the Levering Act Oath, the present
j law requiring all state employees to
| sign a loyalty oath and declare any
| subversive party affiliations. Chapel
j said he would continue to support
j the Levering Act.
Chapel said he thought the law was
I "all right," that it wouldn't hurt "in
[ nocent people" while it was useful in
| singling out "Commies." He re
minded the delegation, who called ;
him off the floor of the Assembly, j
that war hysteria runs high in critical j
times, pointing out a parallel era
when "a lot of legislat ion was passed
j that, hurt a lot of Germans." How-
I ever, he asserted, in peacetime the
enforcement of these bills is "soft
ened."
Levering Act
Two members of the large Uni- '
versity of California delegation were
former student employees who re
fused to sign the Levering Act Oath
and lost their jobs at the university
as a result.
The group from Cal, in urging re
peal of the Levering Act, stressed |
the recent Appellate Court decision
I ruling the loyalty oath required by
| the Board of Regents as unconstitu
j tional.
When confronted with this decision j
I of unconstitutionality, one assembly
man pointed out that this was just
an Appellate Court decision, and he
was confident that the Supreme
Court would reverse the decision.
The Cal delegation told the assem
blyman from their county, Thomas
j Caldeeott (R), who is supporting the
| Levering Act. that they felt their
j university had suffered much and
| gained little from the loyalty oath j
| issue. They contended that diplomas
! from Cal had lost prestige due to
J blacklisting of the university by vari
i ous academic associations.
Caldeeott, however, expressed his
I faith in the university and said of
the teachers who left the university,
| "They will return."

I providing measures for removal of

j said he would continue to support

Chapel said he thought the law was
I "all right," that it wouldn't hurt "in
[ nocent people" while it was useful in
| singling out "Commies." He re
minded the delegation, who called ;
him off the floor of the Assembly, j
that war hysteria runs high in critical j
times, pointing out a parallel era
when "a lot of legislat ion was passed
j that, hurt a lot of Germans." How-
I ever, he asserted, in peacetime the
enforcement of these bills is "soft
ened."
Levering Act
Two members of the large Uni- '
versity of California delegation were
former student employees who re
fused to sign the Levering Act Oath
and lost their jobs at the university
as a result.
The group from Cal, in urging re
peal of the Levering Act, stressed |
the recent Appellate Court decision
I ruling the loyalty oath required by
| the Board of Regents as unconstitu
j tional.
When confronted with this decision j
I of unconstitutionality, one assembly
man pointed out that this was just
an Appellate Court decision, and he
was confident that the Supreme
Court would reverse the decision.
The Cal delegation told the assem
blyman from their county, Thomas
j Caldeeott (R), who is supporting the
| Levering Act. that they felt their
j university had suffered much and
| gained little from the loyalty oath j
| issue. They contended that diplomas
