# Education Aim Defined By Scholar

### TOM NEVILLE 
Summarizing his talk on "The 1
Essentials of Education," Sir I
Richard Livingstone last night |
urged as a primary educational 1
aim knowledge of what is first
rate in one's vocation, in the in
tellectual and creative achieve
ments of man, and in "the job
of living."
Sir Richard, former head of ;
Corpus Christi College, Oxford, J
speaking on the regular Tuesday
Evening Series in Memorial Hall, em- [
phasized that "the discovery of what I
is best in human nature and conduct" j
is the most important part of educa- ;
tion and the part most often ignored. ;
'"We need," he remarked, "clearer
standards. We need to know the dis
tinction between first- and second- \
rate, good and bad. Ignorance here ;
is written all over our age."
"We have much that is good, but j
good and bad have never been so
mixed," the elderly British educator j
went on. The public, he said, has ]
never been less aware of these dif- j
ferences, citing modern newspapers
and movies as examples of what
forms human attitudes today.
To find these distinctions in one's
vocation is not difficult.. Sir Richard
claimed. Values in art, commonly
considered "the frills of life," need a
restatement, he explained, since they
surround us daily and are part of
existence.
"If they arc 'frills,' why are they
among the few immortal things in
this world? Why are long dead
people like Shakespeare and Plato
remembered today?" he asked.
What Sir Richard regards as the
most crucial aim of education is in
the area of human nature. Distinc
j tions between great and mediocre in
; human life can most easily be found
i in literature. "Here is man talking to
■ himself. We see every thought.
! vision, fancy, emotion that has ever
; passed through the human mind. A
j lifetime cannot give as wide expe
j rience as literature."
Yet literature doesn't always show
! what is good in man, he continued.
1 As in art, distinctions must be made.
Sir Richard illustrated his point by
• saying that "Hemingway and Coward
I are superficial compared to Shaw,
' and Shaw is superficial compared to
j Shakespeare."
Education allows man to meet the
first-rate and to fulfill "the desire
j for excellence," the real motive be
hind going to school or college. "Make
! the acquaintance of those who have
| known the meaning of cxccllence in
| life," he said.
Sir Richard concluded, "How can
we raise ourselves to heights beyond
our capacities? We can raise our
| selves on the shoulders of those per
sonalities who have known what is
j fir; t-ratc in human character."
