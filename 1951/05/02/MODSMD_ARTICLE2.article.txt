# RFC Investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Former Chair
man James L. Fly of the Federal
Communications Commission urged
an investigation of Henry J. Kai
ser's industrial empire on grounds
it received preferential loan treat
ment from the RFC and other gov
ernment agencies. He said nearly
one- third of the RFC's outstanding
loans were to the diversified Kai
ser concerns in late 1940.
Simultaneously, White House aide
Donald S. Dawson agreed today to
testify May 10 before Senate inves
tigators who have named him as a
key man in an RFC "influence
web."
Reluctant to clap a subpena on a
Presidential aide, the subcommittee
has been trying for weeks to get
Dawson for questioning.
