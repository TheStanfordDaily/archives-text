## 
### 
In a change- of plans, Oily Nor
ville, member of the men's spon
sor choosing committee, announced
yesterday that the deadline for ap
plications for next year's sponsors
in freshman men's halls has been
extended to Friday.
He also stated that all inter
views for this Thursday and Friday
have been canceled, and applicants
signed for those times should sign
for a new time next Monday in the
ASSU office.
Applications for the sponsorships
in Eneina, Toyon, or the Village are
available in the ASSU office. Also
to be selected are the jobs of head
sponsor, social chairman, and ath
letic chairman.
The only qualification for the
prospective sponsor is that he be a
junior or a senior next year.
Other members of the sponsor
choosing committee besides Nor
ville, who represents the sponsors,
are Bill Bethke of Excom and
Claude Rosenberg of the resident
assistants.
