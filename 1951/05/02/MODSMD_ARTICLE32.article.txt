# President Had Korea Warning
## War Predicted In 1947 Report 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 1 (UP)
Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer
warned President Truman in
J 947 — three years before the
outbreak of war — that Commu
nist forces would attack South
Korea, it was disclosed today.
The warning was contained in the
long-secret Wedemeyer report on
Korea, which was made public by the
Senate committee investigating Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur's ouster as Far
East commander by President Tru
man.
Wedemeyer correctly predicted
that, the Red assault would come after
U.S. and Russian occupation troop;
were withdrawn from Korea. He
recommended that an American-led
and American - equipped army be
raised in South Korea to cope with
"the threat from the north."
Wedemeyer also said that the
United States "indirectly facilitated"
Russia's Far East program by grant
ing concessions to the Soviet Union
at the 1945 Yalta Conference and by
withholding military aid to National
ist China.
Sen. William F. Knowland. R. Ca!.,
who had demanded publication of the
Wedemeyer report, said it would
have "shocked" the nation into tak
ing effective action if it had been re
leased in time.
Chairman Richard B. Russell, I),
Ga., of the investigating committee
said the Defense Department re
moved the top-secret label from the
. report as his "insistence." Official.-,
said a relatively few paragraphs of
the original report were deleted for
"military security" reasons." At least,
some of this material, it was learned,
was criticism of the South Korean
government.
Wedemeyer, now commander of
! the U.S. Sixth Army with headquar
ters in San Francisco, had "no com
| ment" on the publication of his re-
I port, and directed all questions to the
pentagon in Washington.
Republican senators meantime
called for another secret document
i a report circulated by the Joint
j Chiefs of Staff last Jan. 12. They said
it would fcack up Ma< - Arthur's claim
i that, the Joint Chiefs endorsed his
i proposals for waging limited war on
Red China.
Mac Arthur himself will open the
formal investigation with closed-donr
testimony Thursday. He will be fol
! lowed by Defense Secretary George
C. Marshall, Gen. Omar N. Bradley,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and the Joint Chiefs themselves.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (UP)
Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer
warned President Truman in
J 947 — three years before the
outbreak of war — that Commu
nist forces would attack South
Korea, it was disclosed today.
The warning was contained in the
long-secret Wedemeyer report on
Korea, which was made public by the
Senate committee investigating Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur's ouster as Far
East commander by President Tru
man.
Wedemeyer correctly predicted
that, the Red assault would come after
U.S. and Russian occupation troop;
were withdrawn from Korea. He
recommended that an American-led
and American - equipped army be
raised in South Korea to cope with
"the threat from the north."
Wedemeyer also said that the
United States "indirectly facilitated"
Russia's Far East program by grant
