# BULL SESSION

### EARL ODELL 
The coming Spring Show may be the start of the
greatest commercial enterprise of ail times, and I want
to be in on the ground floor.
The story, written by Jack Nisbet, with music by
Wally White, concerns a bottle containing chastity-

testing vapor. ll' there is such a
vapor, think of the market value.
I'eople would pay a small fortune
for a thimble-full. It might even
replace perfume.
Just imagine! No longer would
you have to rely on those big,
blue, innocent eyes and a de
mure, "Who, me?"

Itumors have it that a lot of research preceded this
show, and knowing Nisbet and White as I do, I sus
pt-( t there is more than a grain of truth to the vapor.
Nisbet is already well Known for his graduate
studies in chastity, in fact, he's written a thesis en
titled, "The Chaste and I."
White, on the other hand, is the naive type. He's so
shy that when they lost the cork to the chastity bottle,
he gave himself chicken pox and lit out for the Isola
tion Hospital.
Casting of the Spring Show proved difficult. Too
many of the tryoutees turned blue when they stepped
on the stage. Something about the vapor affecting cer
tain persons. Not wanting a show full of blue actors

and actresses, the casting director had to test every
one who tried out for a part. Send 10 cents and one
box top for a full list of names, addresses, and tele
phone numbers.
The show almost bogged down at one point when a
girl who was chosen for one of the leads was tested.
Instead of turning blue, she turned pink. This
stumped chastity experts White and Nisbet, but
Wally finally solved the problem by writing a new
song for her. It's entitled, "What Do You Do When
You Don't Know If You've Ever Done It Or Not?"
This didn't end the casting problems, though. The
show called for the casting of a talking parrot. His
lines are simple enough—all he has to say is "For
ms, Bornis," sinrof, sinrub spelled backwards. But
much to the casting director's dismay, the only par
rots in the immediate vicinity were stupid, so he had
to satisfy himself with a stupid parrot and Steve Blum
berg, who has learned his lines quite rapidly.
I understand, however, that recently the parrot
came through—he learned his lines, so Hlumherg
may be out of a job. The parrot is being coached on
his cues now.
At any rate, if I can get hold of a bottle of that chas
tity vapor, I'll become a millionaire. Of course, to
mass-produce it I'll have to have capital, but 1 can get
plenty of money with one whiff of the vapor by black
mailing a Roble girl.
