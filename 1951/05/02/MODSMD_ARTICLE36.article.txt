conference: Hon Hayes, public relations; Nancy la
Montague, registration; Conrad von Bibra, finance;
Kay Cohrt, agenda; Carol Penney, materials; Hal Ro
gers, publicity; Winnie Wylie, housing; Harry Hall
iind Diana Fehrenbach, secretariat; and Jim Roberts,

... and a Word of Thanks
To the Editor:
In an inconspicuous little room in one of the World
War I shacks work a group of shiny-eyed, enthusias
tic Stanford students. They do an awful lot to spread
Stanford's good will throughout the world. They don't
get paid for their work except in satisfaction. These
people are all tired this week. They've been skipping
class, missing tests, sleeping little, and working much.
Don't you think we ought to take time out to give
these folks a word of thanks, not only for the Model
United Nations, but for the thousands of little things
and big things they do year round to improve Stan
lord's share of International Relations?
