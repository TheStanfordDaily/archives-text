### 
A new and annoying epidemic
has struck the campus, according to
Dr. George Houck, director oi' the
Health Service. "Apparently many
Stanford students are unable to rec
ognize one of the most common
plants in this area—poison oak," he
said.
An unusually wet winter has re
sulted in a lush growth of native
flora on and near the campus. As
a consequence numerous students
i have reported to the Health Serv
j ice with complaints of hay fever and
| poison oak.
Dr. Houck suggests that students
take steps to familiarize themselves
j with the appearance of the poison
oak plant before they start out ,on
any hikes and picnics. He feels this
| would be most helpful in lowering
the number of uncomfortable, itch
i ing students in the coming weeks.
