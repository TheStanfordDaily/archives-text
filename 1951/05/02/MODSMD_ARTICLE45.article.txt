# A 						HOME AT LAST
## Eating Clubs Wait Years for Building 
### PHIL WILCOX 
In 1901 the first of Stanford's seven Eating Clubs was organized
on campus. This fall, half a century later, the clubs will embark
on their most ambitious project when they move into the new
$183,000 Eating Club Building, now being constructed near Toyon
Hall.
Financing the equipment and setting the seven clubs up to feed

| more than 250 men in the fall have
; been the problems of the Interclub
president and manager and many
' members of the clubs this past year.
The history of the clubs, com
: mencing with the 1901 organizatoin
| of Los Arcos, has been one of ac
tive participation in all aspects of
student life. Eleven years after the
| formation of the first club, Breakers,
; El Campo, and El Tore clubs were
j organized and built their own
! kitchens and club rooms near the
I site of the new building.
Three "Independents"
The latter three clubs were
I known as the "independents," as
: they operated entirely outside of
the University dining hall sphere.
| When Encina Commons was built
' Los Arcos, El Capitan, El Cuadro,
and El Tigre were formed and each
j maintained a clubroom in one of the
j small dining rooms.

Tomorrow evening (he seven
Stanford eating clubs will be hosts
at Â«m informal open house in (lie
Village Clubhouse.
The open house, which will be
open to Off-campus as well as Vil
lage men, will be held from 7:15
to 9. Refreshments will be served.

In the formation of the clubs, the
main idea stressed was that they
were to be loosely organized groups
which offer the advantages of a so
cial organization and yet allow the
members as much personal freedom
as they desire.
The clubs suspended operations
in 1943, due to the second World
War. At the same time the building
of the three independent clubs was
destroyed, and the clubrooms in En
cina Commons were taken over by
the dining hall.
Resumed in 1946
In IJJ4G the clubs resumed opera
tions and have since then eaten in
one large room of Encina Commons.
Following the reorganization, the
clubs have once again become ac
tive in social programs and intra
mural athletics.
The large portion of the club
membership lives in Toyon Hall,
where a portion of the vacancies are
given to new Eating Club men each
quarter.
