gles man, easily downed Norm
Schlecht of the Broncos, 6-2. 6-1.
While Herb Flam was winning the
men's singles title in the Ojai Invi
tational Tournament over last week
end, Stanford's entrants in the inter
collegiate men's division were faring
much better than expected.
George Gentry lost to Jack Schu
macher of UCLA in the quarter
finals, 13-11, 6-4. Gentry had the !
Bruin 8-7 and 30-love in the first act |

second round to a George Pepperdine
College pair, 6-2, 6-2. The match was
held in a late afternoon haze in which
the weak-eyed Indian combination
had severe difficulty following the
ball.
A promising Cardbabe team of Jim
Cornish and Art Fish went all the
way to the finals of freshman doubles
competition before losing to Stafford I

Off the Indians' performance in the
tournament and against Santa Clara,
Coach Bob Renker rates them over
San Francisco State, and says, "If we
