What would your answer be
to the following two questions:
What's wrong with the Stanford
track team? How come we've
had three years of good frosh
squads after which only a rela
tively few trickle onto the var
sity?
Sounds like a familiar story,
doesn't it. The last time those ques
tions were asked wc wound up with
a new football coach.
Don't for a moment get the idea
that the same answers apply in both
cases. Football and track are two
entirely different sports. Football
requires a great deal of team work,
whereas track, with certain excep
tions, is strictly a matter of indi
vidual participation.
Watching the Stanford-USC meet
Monday night, a few questions came
to mind which, after a checkup,
proved to be on the minds of others
also. Not that we had a chance of
beating Troy, but the Cards could
have picked up a couple of more
points.
Why, for instance, were Indian
runners trying to pass on turns?
Bad judgment on (lie part of the
runners? They lost about five
yards each time thev tried it. Or
was it a coaching fault?
Another example—why was Card
distance man John Kaufman
switched from the two-mile to the
one-mile? He didn't help in the
one-mile, but might have picked up
a third in the two-mile. Poor strat
egy?
To get more general, why wasn't
pole vaulter George Van Heusen
permitted to make the Occidental
trip a couple of weeks ago? He
showed up the morning of depar
ture and was told that the team
already had a pole vaulter (Bob
Meyers). If George had gone along,
Stanford would have won the meet.
Poor attitude?
To carry this thing a little far
ther, why is it that out of the
eight or ten good distance men
that where on last year's frosh
squad, only a coaple are with the
varsity this season? Clash of per-

sonalities with Coach Weiershau
ser?
Stanford's had fairly good track
teams in the past thanks to a few
outstanding men like Gay Bryan, a
natural; Otis Chandler, coached
personally by Dink Templeton; and
Bud Held, coached by Cornelius
Warmerdam.
The point is, we believe Stanford
could be better.

ture and was told that the team
already had a pole vaulter (Bob
Meyers). If George had gone along,
Stanford would have won the meet.
Poor attitude?
To carry this thing a little far
ther, why is it that out of the
eight or ten good distance men
that where on last year's frosh
squad, only a coaple are with the
varsity this season? Clash of per-

sonalities with Coach Weiershau
ser?
Stanford's had fairly good track
teams in the past thanks to a few
outstanding men like Gay Bryan, a
natural; Otis Chandler, coached
personally by Dink Templeton; and
Bud Held, coached by Cornelius
Warmerdam.
The point is, we believe Stanford
could be better.
What would your answer be
to the following two questions:
What's wrong with the Stanford
track team? How come we've
had three years of good frosh
squads after which only a rela
tively few trickle onto the var
sity?
Sounds like a familiar story,
doesn't it. The last time those ques
tions were asked wc wound up with
a new football coach.
Don't for a moment get the idea
that the same answers apply in both
cases. Football and track are two
entirely different sports. Football
requires a great deal of team work,
whereas track, with certain excep
tions, is strictly a matter of indi
vidual participation.
Watching the Stanford-USC meet
Monday night, a few questions came
to mind which, after a checkup,
proved to be on the minds of others
also. Not that we had a chance of
beating Troy, but the Cards could
have picked up a couple of more
points.
Why, for instance, were Indian
runners trying to pass on turns?
Bad judgment on (lie part of the
runners? They lost about five
yards each time thev tried it. Or
was it a coaching fault?
Another example—why was Card
distance man John Kaufman
switched from the two-mile to the
one-mile? He didn't help in the
one-mile, but might have picked up
a third in the two-mile. Poor strat
egy?
To get more general, why wasn't
pole vaulter George Van Heusen
permitted to make the Occidental
trip a couple of weeks ago? He
showed up the morning of depar
ture and was told that the team
already had a pole vaulter (Bob
Meyers). If George had gone along,
Stanford would have won the meet.
