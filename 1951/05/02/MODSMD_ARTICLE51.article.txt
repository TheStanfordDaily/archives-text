# Golfers Follow Winning Pattern
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
In recent years there's been a
name synonymous with cham
pionship collegiate golf — and
that's been Stanford. Since the
organization of the Pacific Coast
Golf Conference in 1938, the
Cards have been league winners
seven times and have produced
five national championship
teams.
In 1938 a team of Art Doering, A 1 j
Hyman, Warren McCanless, Bill j
Boyd, John Cannon, and Bill Rea |
I became the first of many Stanford j
teams to wear the NCAA crown. An
example of their strength is shown
by the results of the USC meet that
year.
Doering and Cannon were each
j five under par with 66's; Boyd shot i
] a 67, McCanless a 68. Hyman a 70, |
and Rea a 72 to sweep the meet and |
I average 68.2 strokes per man.
In 1939, a team of Bud Finger,
Dick Wright, Jack Showalter, Don
Kennedy, Warren Berl, and Doer
ing again won the Nationals; and
in 1941, Bud Finger, Dee Keplogle,
Warren Berl, and Bud Brownell
again turned the trick.
The 1941 team had a total of 580
strokes in the national tournament,

an average of 145 strokes per man
on one of the hardest courses in the
country.
In 1942, Stanford again won the
championship with Bud Brownell,
Sandy Tatum, Frank McCann, and
George Traphagen leading the way.
Tatum was the individual NCAA
champion, and in the same year
Brownell set the Stanford course
record of 64.
After a three-year layoff due to
the war, Stanford, represented by
Frank MrCann, Tom Lambie, Bob
Kosburg, Jack Shuler, and Bob
Cardinal, again became NCAA
titleholders. In the I'CC tourna
ment that year, Stanford finished
37 strokes ahead of California,
their nearest competitor.
Stanford has gone to the Nation
als three times since then, and last
year finished third. This year's team
has gone undefeated, winning their
first 11 matches, and will most prob
ably again be asked to represent the
PCC at the NCAA tournament in
June.
Many experts agree that this
year's team is one of the best-bal
anced outfits in the school's his
tory. It is seldom that one finds
the number 5 and 6 men on a col
lege team averaging 76 strokes
per round on a course such as
Stanford's, but that's what the
case has been so far.

In all probability, here are the
men who will represent us in the
Nationals:
Number one man throughout the
season has been Dick MeElyea, a
junior from Palo Alto. Last year
Dick was the individual PCC cham
pion and he is favored to repeat.
In high school he won the PAL
crown two years in a row and in
1948 he was Santa Clara County
Junior Champion. Dick has an al
most invincible short game, and is
among the five top collegiate golfers
! in the country today.
Number two man John "Stork"
Knosher is one of the longest hit
ters on the team. He attended
Naperville High in Illinois, and in
1949, his iunior year at Stanford,
was medalist in the Southern Cal
ifornia Public Links Tournament.
A pair of sophomores, Roland
Conklin and Art Schroeder, hold
j down the number three and six
spots, respectively. Conklin, who
swings like Sammy Snead, is prob
ably the longest hitter on the coast.
Number four and five men, Keith
Beekman and John Elliott, have a
| habit of coming through when points
are needed most. It is the outstand
ing performances turned in by these
and the four other squad members
time after time that make this year's
| Stanford team one ol the greatest
! »;ver.


1951 CARDS—Pictured (left to right) are golfers Cully Ingraham,
Tom Mcllugh (manager), Roland Conklin, and John Elliott in
the front row; and coach Bud Finger, Art Schroeder, Dick Mc-
Elyea, Keith Beekman, and Jack Knosher in the back. Following
in the tradition set by the '38, '39, '41, '42, and '46 teams, this is
the squad that could carry Stanford to its sixth NCAA golf
championship.
