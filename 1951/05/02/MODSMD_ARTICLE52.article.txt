# McElyea Leads In All-U Golf
## 
### 
Three putts on the 18th green cost
Roland Conklin a would-be victory
for the first 18 holes of the annual
All - University Golf Tournament,
played yesterday at the Stanford
| golf course.
McElyea, who finished one-up for ;
i the first 18 holes, shot a seven-over- j
par 78 to Conklin's 79. His superior j
short game was the difference, since I
Conklin won driving honors on 10 !
out of the 14 long holes.
With the match all even after 17 i
; holes, McElyea sliced his drive into
j some tall grass. His second shot
j from a practically unplayable lie
i put him just past Conklin's 265-yard
j drive. Each golfer then bounced his
| iron shot onto and just off the hard
ened, wind-swept green, McElyea's
I ball, lying a few feet farther away.
McElyea chipped his approach
| shot three feet from the pin, but
! Conklin had no such luck. His ball j
: stopped about six feet past McEl- j
yea's. Dick then hit his putt for a !
one - over - par five, but Conklin j
missed the first and the second |
putts, took a double bogie six on |
j the hole, and went one-down in I
I the match. i
