# Student Liberals Lay Gripes Publicly Before Legislators
## 
### JOY HAAS 
In a little Chinese cafe in Sacramento Sunday night, young labor
unionists and liberals from minority groups joined the student
youth lobby for academic freedom in a dinner meeting to discuss
their beliefs and criticisms of bills before the lawmakers.
A young member of the International Longshoremen's and

Warehousemen's Union stood up and
told the story of his buddy who cir
culated a peace petition among the
crew of the ship he was working on.
According to the unionist, his friend
was screened, charged with subvers- |
ivc activities and fired. A month |
later he was inducted into the Army.
"They say we are disloyal," said
the waterfront worker. "But I say
to whom — our country or our
boss?"
Then a young graduate student
from Cal who lost bus job at the uni
versity for refusing to sign the Lev
ering Act oath told his story. He, and
other Cal students in the same boat,

tried to bring an injunction to col- j
lcct back wages on the grounds that
the Levering Act violated six points
under the constitution.
Kights ''Bombed Out"
The answer that the group received
in the first Superior Court of San
Francisco can be found in the Daily |
Cal newspaper. The Assistant Dis- |
trict Attorney argued that the atom j
bomb had amended the Bill of Rights
out of the Constitution, and main
tained that they no longer mattered
because our country is in vital dan- j
ger.
A young Negro, representing a pro- j
gressive liberal group in Los An
geles, spoke with emotion and con- '
viction against the war in Korea.
"They don't want you to say any
thing," Charles Mosely asserted. "We
just sit bark silent-like, waiting for
a few people to take us away, then
bring us back to what we left. Those
people in Korea don't want a democ
racy that reeks of Jim Crowism."
It is very possible that many of the
examples of discrimination poinied
out at this meeting were stock stories
collected to support one side. How
ever, any question of their validity
doesn't erase the basic point. As long
as the general conditions that breed
the specific examples exist, these
people are going to agitate.
Democracy in Action
The meeting of the California Leg
islative Conference in Sacramento
Sunday afternoon was an example of
democracy in action. Undeniably the
groups represented were liberal, from
one pole to the other, hut regardless
of race, social status, or creed, 600
people cared enough about what they
believed to join forces in Sacramento
| to try to bring about the correction of
their grievances by "due process of
| law " They talked to the lawmakers
j and gave encouragement to one an
i other in their individual group cf
: forts to abolish what they feel is op-
I pressive legislation.
It really brought home to me the
i fact that a myriad of new laws on the
1 books isn't gong to stop these people
from thinking and criticizing our de
' mocracy in operation. They want to
be heard and heeded.

out of the Constitution, and main
tained that they no longer mattered

A young Negro, representing a pro- j
gressive liberal group in Los An

viction against the war in Korea.
"They don't want you to say any
thing," Charles Mosely asserted. "We
just sit bark silent-like, waiting for
a few people to take us away, then
bring us back to what we left. Those
people in Korea don't want a democ
racy that reeks of Jim Crowism."
It is very possible that many of the
examples of discrimination poinied
out at this meeting were stock stories
collected to support one side. How
ever, any question of their validity
doesn't erase the basic point. As long

the specific examples exist, these
people are going to agitate.
Democracy in Action
The meeting of the California Leg
islative Conference in Sacramento
Sunday afternoon was an example of
democracy in action. Undeniably the
groups represented were liberal, from
one pole to the other, hut regardless
of race, social status, or creed, 600
people cared enough about what they
believed to join forces in Sacramento
| to try to bring about the correction of
their grievances by "due process of
| law " They talked to the lawmakers
j and gave encouragement to one an
i other in their individual group cf
: forts to abolish what they feel is op-
I pressive legislation.
It really brought home to me the
i fact that a myriad of new laws on the
1 books isn't gong to stop these people
from thinking and criticizing our de
' mocracy in operation. They want to
be heard and heeded.


FARM COED KIBITZES—A lobbyist for world peace and a Cal
graduate talk as Lois Deimel of Stanford looks on.


LOBBY FOR ACADEMIC FREEDOM—Members of the young
labor unionists and young minority group liberals met for a
lobby session at Sacramento. Attending the meeting were rep
resentatives from several colleges, including Stanford, Califor
nia, and UCLA.
In a little Chinese cafe in Sacramento Sunday night, young labor
unionists and liberals from minority groups joined the student
youth lobby for academic freedom in a dinner meeting to discuss
their beliefs and criticisms of bills before the lawmakers.
A young member of the International Longshoremen's and

Warehousemen's Union stood up and
told the story of his buddy who cir
culated a peace petition among the
crew of the ship he was working on.
According to the unionist, his friend
was screened, charged with subvers- |
ivc activities and fired. A month |
later he was inducted into the Army.
"They say we are disloyal," said
the waterfront worker. "But I say
to whom — our country or our
boss?"
Then a young graduate student
from Cal who lost bus job at the uni
versity for refusing to sign the Lev
ering Act oath told his story. He, and
other Cal students in the same boat,

tried to bring an injunction to col- j
lcct back wages on the grounds that
the Levering Act violated six points
under the constitution.
Kights ''Bombed Out"
The answer that the group received
in the first Superior Court of San
Francisco can be found in the Daily |
Cal newspaper. The Assistant Dis- |
trict Attorney argued that the atom j
bomb had amended the Bill of Rights
out of the Constitution, and main
tained that they no longer mattered
