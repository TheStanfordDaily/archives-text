# Communists Mass For New Attack
## 
### 
TOKYO, Thursday, May 3 (UP) —Allied artillery which helped
turn the Communists' spring offensive into a "great victory" for
the Allies blazed again today on a new Communist troops buildup
northeast of Seoul.
A dispatch from the front between Seoul and Chunchon, 45

miles to the northeast, said the Com- j
munists were massing men and sup- ]
plies for what appeared to* be new
preparations for an attack along that
sector of the 90-mile battle line.
An unidentified aircraft dropped
four bombs on a ridgeline a few
thousand yards in front of United
Nations positions in the Chunchon
area early Thursday morning and
Communist artillery northwest of
Seoul dropped "hundreds" of shells
into the UN defense perimeter.
Allied guns blazed out again
Wednesday night to silence the Red
artillery northwest of Seoul, but
the enemy lire and the new build
up emphasized the warning by 1,1.
Cien. James A. Van Fleet that the
Reds might strike again as bard as
before, or harder.
It was Van Fleet, new commander
of the International 8th Army, who
proclaimed the Allies' "great victory"
in stopping the Chinese offensive far
short of its goal.
The dispatch from the west central
front said the Chinese set off five
green flares in front, of UN positions
southwest of Yongchon - the usual
preparation for an attack. Rut no ac
tion followed.
Allied planes yesterday bombed
and strafed another Chinese troop
and supply buildup in the Chang
gong area along the Seoul-Chun -
rhon road. Two of the targets were
I believed to be regimental and di
visional command posts.
U.S. Patton tanks, in one of the
| largest tank columns of the war,
j probed far north of the Seoul de
fense line through the great No Man's
Land separating the two armies.
They rolled up to the outskirts of Ui
| jongbu. II miles above Seoul, before
finding large groups of enemy troops.
There were unconfirmed reports
the enemy was withdrawing from
! contact on the Seoul front, to prepare
an attack by two North Korean and
I one Chinese division across the Han
| in an outflanking atlark on Seoul, but
r Allied officers received the reports
I with skepticism.

Seoul dropped "hundreds" of shells
into the UN defense perimeter.
Allied guns blazed out again
Wednesday night to silence the Red
artillery northwest of Seoul, but
the enemy lire and the new build
up emphasized the warning by 1,1.
Cien. James A. Van Fleet that the
Reds might strike again as bard as
before, or harder.
It was Van Fleet, new commander
of the International 8th Army, who
proclaimed the Allies' "great victory"
in stopping the Chinese offensive far
short of its goal.
The dispatch from the west central
front said the Chinese set off five
green flares in front, of UN positions
southwest of Yongchon - the usual
preparation for an attack. Rut no ac
tion followed.
Allied planes yesterday bombed
and strafed another Chinese troop
and supply buildup in the Chang
gong area along the Seoul-Chun -
rhon road. Two of the targets were
I believed to be regimental and di
visional command posts.
U.S. Patton tanks, in one of the
| largest tank columns of the war,
j probed far north of the Seoul de
fense line through the great No Man's
Land separating the two armies.
They rolled up to the outskirts of Ui
| jongbu. II miles above Seoul, before
finding large groups of enemy troops.
There were unconfirmed reports
the enemy was withdrawing from
! contact on the Seoul front, to prepare
an attack by two North Korean and
I one Chinese division across the Han
| in an outflanking atlark on Seoul, but
r Allied officers received the reports
I with skepticism.
