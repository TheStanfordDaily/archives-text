# Excom Takes Action On Cardinals, Elections
## Reg Dances Considered 
### 
Excom last night approved two recommendations lo next year's
Election Board and Executive Committee designed to improve the
present ASSU election set-up.
One proposal asked Election Board to schedule nominations for
ASSU elections on Thursda'y and Friday of one week and Monday

and Tuesday of the next, with dec
linations deadline Wednesday and
the primary election the following
Wednesday.
The second recommendation, to
next year's Excom, was that a com
pulsory training program he insti
tuted to acquaint all candidates for
ASSU Excom positions with the
functions of student government.
Iti other business. Excom made |
another recommendation to next
year's officers concerning Reg j
dances and refused to allow four ;
organizations to bold social affairs
on dates already closed.
ASSU Vice - President Jo Lyon
proposed, and Excom unanimously
approved, a recommendation to the
1951-52 Excom that the winter and
I spring Reg dances be held the first
i weekend of the quarter on a trial
j basis.
In making the recommendation, i
| Miss Lyon said that poor attend- |
i ance at. past winter and spring Reg
I dances has demonstrated the neces
j sity for some revision in the present
situation in order to make these
situation in order to make these
j dances money-making affairs.
In regard to the same problem,
| Excom also approved an addition
to the ASSU by-laws concerning
[ social procedure that all groups
applying for sponsorship of a Reg
dance submit their tentative plans
| as to music, decorations, expenses,
etc.. to the Activities Board well
| in advance.
A normally routine procedure, the
j matter of dates for social affairs,
{ provoked controversy when Miss
Lyon brought up five requests by
organizations for closed affairs on
May 5 and May 18, dates which had
j already been closed.
j At last week's meeting, Excom

; had made an exception to the ASSU
Constitution by granting Sigma Chi's
request for a closed Sweetheart Rail
this Saturday night. Toyon Hall
i had previously been granted that
night as a closed date for their for
j mal dance. The members had justi
j fied their exception in Sigma Chi's
: case on special reasons put forward
| by the fraternity.
One of the requests last night,
by Theta Xi. also based its peti
tion on "special reasons." Both
Harry Rowe, graduate student
representative, and Rowland Reb
elc. Daily editor, pointed out that
to deny Theta Xi's request would
be "inconsistent'' with Excom's
stand last week.
Excom members agreed that a
I poor precedent had been set in the
1 Sigma Chi action, but voted down
1 Theta Xi's ieqtip."t, by a 1 to 3 vote.
