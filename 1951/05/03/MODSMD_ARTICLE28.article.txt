# Thievery Under Our Noses
## 
### 
The kampus kleptomaniacs are at it again.
Last Saturday, while members of the Red and
White teams were out tossing the pigskin
around, thieves lifted some $300 from the foot
ballers' lockers.
The victims—some of whom lost as much as
$30 —had failed to lock up before taking off.
Chances are there won't be very many unat
tended lockers in the next few days. The word
has gone out. and the athletes are watching
their step.
If past experience is any indication, however,
the period of lockertight integrity will fade
away after the "few days" are up. The scare
will have worn off.
The alarming thing about campus petty
theft is that it's going on all over the place: at
the Boathouse, on the How, at the Cellar, at
the Gym. and even in the parking lots.
What can you do about it. 3 There's only one
answer; watch your valuables and keep on
watching them. Hide your wallet before going
to bed at night, lock your gym locker, your bi
cycle and your car, glass-in the candy counters
at the Cellar, abolish notion selling in the men's
and women's houses on the Row.
At the Boathouse, where lifeguard Pete Cole
reports numerous locker room thefts, an intelli
gent solution seems in sight.
The Men's Faculty Club has 40 lockers for
sale. According to the latest dope, the double
tiered, wire-and-metal containers will go for
something near $10 apiece.

Before the situation gets worse, we'd re
commend Excom look into their purchase and
installation. There are no such facilities now
existing at the lake.
As Jake Irwin over at the Gym store tells us,
the minute a $1.25 tariff was slapped on towel
rentals, students began locking up and the in
cidence of robberies diminished noticeably.
Up on the Row—where wallets are sifted of
their contents every now and then with discon
certing regularity —the only remedy lies with
the residents themselves. Where money is lost
in the operation of candy counters in the
houses, the counters should go without further
ado.
We've talked too much about "stopping" the
thieves themselves. It's nearly impossible, ex
cept in a few isolated cases where "inside" jobs
are apparent. Preventive medicine seems to be
the only answer and we can apply it by elimi
nating the opportunity —verily, the invitation
to steal.
Paradoxically enough, it's now become our
own fault if we fall victim to the kleptomani
acs.
