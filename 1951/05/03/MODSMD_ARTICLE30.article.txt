## Palo Alto Bans 'Manon' 
### ROY HEMMING GEORGE BUCKLEY 
The much-publicized French film "Manon" was
scheduled to open at the Varsity in Palo Alto this week
but won't. The city's board of censors got an early
look at it, and said No!
Outright suppression is always a dangerous busi
ness. and we have no desire to condone or justify
the ban of ''Manon." But in all honesty it must be
admitted that the picture's taste is pretty low.
The talents of its writer-director, Henri-Georges
Clotfzot, place him unquestionably among the finest
screen technicians in the world today. But some of
his films—such as "The Raven" and his sequence in
"Retour a la Vie"—have pondered excessively over
dreariness and morbidity, often bordering on sadism.
"Manon" pales his previous record.
The Abbe Prevost story of "Manon" has been trans
planted by Clouzot into a modern setting, making her
a wartime collaborationist who latches onto a drifting
Maquis fighter. The film traces the rise and fall of the
young lovers caught in the threads of the postwar
black market.
It is not their environment, however, which trips
them up. Hather it is the >oung and sweet Manon

who drags her young husband's love to the depths of
prostitution, blackmail, and murder. Manon, the story
reveals, wants all of one man and anything possible
from any other; in other words, the wench is a nym
phomaniac.
The real theme of "Manon," then, is not the postwar
struggles of the younger generation as much as a
dramatization of the concept that "passion rules." It
is essentially the story of a girl whose reigning passion
is sex—and Clouzot's treatment pulls no punches on
that point.
For what it reveals of the lovers' difficulties in
finding a stable and healthy livelihood together, the
film is good. Such subjects, even with a liberal dose
of sex, are valid screen subjects. But "Manon" gets
out of hand in its brutal depiction of degeneracy—
which should not, we think, be handled for no more
purpose than just to reveal. The critical point here
is that Clouzot has nothing more to say.
There are, to be sure, many fine touches which show
Clouzot's genuinely gifted film-sense. They become
overshadowed, however, by the other aspects—includ
ing, incidentally, French dialogue that closely resem
bles "The Naked and the Dead," although you might
not realize it fom the English titles.
