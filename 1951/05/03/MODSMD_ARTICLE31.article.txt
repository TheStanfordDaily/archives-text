## As an Old Fossil... 
### 
To The Editor:
StanJord has excelled in the field in comparison with
our performance on the track. A study of the record
will disclo.se that most runners, especially in the "flat"
races, were outstanding runners in high school. These
"nuggets" seem to go to institutions that have many
"scholarships" for track men.
In field events, which are more influenced by coach
ing, one can point with pride to Stanford men havin»
made greater improvement over their previous rec
ords than athletes who have accepted largess else
where. Thus, last Monday our high jumper, coached
in the straight-up style, beat three "superior" men

who have been mis-coached to lean toward;: (he bar
with u belly-roll. >
As an old fossil who finds plenty wrong with pres
ent day Stanford, especially in athletics, oik- can won
der why there are not more men out for track. Also,
why there are not more men out for fencing, boxing,
etc.
II Daily writers would like to do something con
structive, they might take space to second and third
place times and distances. They might go out for track
themselves and learn something about the sport. (They
could learn plenty!)
