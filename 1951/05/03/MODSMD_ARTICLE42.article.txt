# Houck Advises On Poison Oak
## 
### 
What is the best way to avoid
poison oak? Learn to identify the
plant and avoid it, advises Dr.
George Houck, director of the
Health Service.
A very lush growth of the plant
is now in this area. As a result,
there is an unusually large crop of
itching students.
Poison oak, which grows only in
the far Western states, is a low
green shrub. Leaves are small and
shiny with a "scalloped" rather than
"jagged" edge. They grow in groups
of three on the long, slender stem
of the plant. The leaves of an older
or drier plant may have a reddish
tinge.
Colored pictures of poison oak
and some suggestions concerning
precautionary measures are dis
played on the front wall in the
Health Service office.
