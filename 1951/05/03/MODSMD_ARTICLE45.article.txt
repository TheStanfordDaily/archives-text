former Stanford baseball players
and enthusiasts at the Mayfair Ho

The meeting was planned in con

which Stanford played with UCLA
over the weekend in order that
Coach Everett Dean could attend.
Among those who attended the
meeting were Billy McLaine, cap

and first man to wear a Block "S,"
which he made himself.
