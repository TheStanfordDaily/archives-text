It is hard to name the Berkeley

However, Indian Jerry Wood has
sped to times of 15.2 and 24.7 and
could easily upset the Bear great.
The Cardbahes' task looks al
most impossible, for in the In

cubs seem even stronger.
In the 880, where Coach Ray Dean
has four men with marks of 2:00.5
or better, Cal counters with Jack
Nelson at 1:58.4 and a second man
in the l:s9's. Dave Fletcher, with
