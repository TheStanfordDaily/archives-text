# Ex-Stanfordites Crash Past And Present Major Leagues
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Three Farm athletes have played
baseball in the major leagues. Can
| you name them?
Stanford's first participant in the
Big Show was the fabulous Ernie
Nevers. Ernie is considered one of
the two great fullbacks of all time,
but few know that he also tried his
hand at baseball. For several years,
Nevers played football for the Chi
cago Cardinals during the winter
and pitched for the St. Louis
| Browns in the spring and summer.
While Nevers was not outstanding
on the diamond, he still had enough
stuff to last for several years. From
| 192(5 to 1928, Nevers won six and
J lost 12 for the Brownies, who fin
| ished seventh, seventh, and third
i while Nevers hurled for them.
Twenty years later, Stanford add
j ed another name to the big-league
1 rosters, that of Bobby Brown.

Brown Played for Cavils in '45
Brown played for Harry Wolter's
crew in 1945 when they played only
an informal schedule. Brown was a
pre-med student at Stanford.
The Yanks signed him up in 1946
and shipped him to the now-defunct
Newark club. Brown hit .341 for
the Bears and the Yanks brought
him lip toward the end of the sea
son.
Brown stayed with the club
through the next four years and
played on three world championship
teams, in 1947, '49, and '50. Brown's
plugging of the weak third base slot
had much to do with this success.
He hit .288 during his tenure with
the Yanks, but his most remark
able showing was made in World
Series where he sticked .481 in 12
games.
Brown had been interning be
tween seasons and is now a full
fledged doctor. He has quit the
game to become a doctor during
the present emergency.
Merriman in Big Leagues
The most recent Card addition to
the big leagues has been big Lloyd
Merriman. Lloyd gave Stanford its
number one excuse for losing all
its games when he deserted the
gridiron in his senior year to play
baseball.
In 1948 Merriman performed for
Columbia in the South Atlantic
League. His average was an im
pressive .298 and in addition he led
the league in triples and stolen
bases.

i He went to Cincinnati next year
j and has been there ever since. In
| ability to hit left-handed pitching
i has cost Lloyd a permanent starting
berth.. His speed and hustle, how
j ever, have earned him the admira
; tion of the Reds' fans, who have
dubbed hrm "Citation" after the
race-horse who is currently losing
at Bay Meadov/s. Merriman's life
| time average is .'244.
Other Indians Trying
A few. other Stanford lads have
an outside chance of being big
leaguers of the future.
Dave Melton hit well over .300
j during his two-year stay at Yakima.
He was set for a starting berth for
| the San Francisco Seals when the
' dr'Aft caught him.
Dave Dahle twirled spectacular
1 ball for Oakland this spring, but has
! been sent down to Wenatchee for
| seasoning.
Finally, there is the big left
hander Jack Heinen. Heinen was
| overshadowed by Joe Chez last
j year, but the San Jose Red Sox
apparently thought he had the stuff,
j for they signed him up. Heinen
! looked tfppd'winning last Thursday.

Three Farm athletes have played
baseball in the major leagues. Can
| you name them?
Stanford's first participant in the
Big Show was the fabulous Ernie
Nevers. Ernie is considered one of
the two great fullbacks of all time,
but few know that he also tried his
hand at baseball. For several years,
Nevers played football for the Chi
cago Cardinals during the winter
and pitched for the St. Louis
| Browns in the spring and summer.
While Nevers was not outstanding
on the diamond, he still had enough
stuff to last for several years. From
| 192(5 to 1928, Nevers won six and
J lost 12 for the Brownies, who fin
| ished seventh, seventh, and third
i while Nevers hurled for them.
Twenty years later, Stanford add
j ed another name to the big-league
1 rosters, that of Bobby Brown.

Brown Played for Cavils in '45
Brown played for Harry Wolter's
crew in 1945 when they played only
an informal schedule. Brown was a
pre-med student at Stanford.
The Yanks signed him up in 1946
and shipped him to the now-defunct
Newark club. Brown hit .341 for
the Bears and the Yanks brought
him lip toward the end of the sea
son.
Brown stayed with the club
through the next four years and
played on three world championship
teams, in 1947, '49, and '50. Brown's
plugging of the weak third base slot
had much to do with this success.
He hit .288 during his tenure with
the Yanks, but his most remark
able showing was made in World
Series where he sticked .481 in 12
games.
Brown had been interning be
tween seasons and is now a full
fledged doctor. He has quit the
game to become a doctor during
the present emergency.
Merriman in Big Leagues
The most recent Card addition to
the big leagues has been big Lloyd
Merriman. Lloyd gave Stanford its
number one excuse for losing all
its games when he deserted the
gridiron in his senior year to play
baseball.
In 1948 Merriman performed for
Columbia in the South Atlantic
League. His average was an im
pressive .298 and in addition he led
the league in triples and stolen
bases.

i He went to Cincinnati next year
j and has been there ever since. In
| ability to hit left-handed pitching
i has cost Lloyd a permanent starting
berth.. His speed and hustle, how
j ever, have earned him the admira
; tion of the Reds' fans, who have
dubbed hrm "Citation" after the
race-horse who is currently losing
at Bay Meadov/s. Merriman's life
| time average is .'244.
