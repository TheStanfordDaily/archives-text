## McElyea Is All-U Champ 
### 
Dick McElyea, displaying one of
the greatest short games ever seen
on the Stanford course, edged Ro
land Conklin yesterday 3-2 to be
come Stanford's 1951 All-Univer
sity golf champion.
The Palo Alto junior, one-up go
ing into today's half of the 3fi-hole
match, shot a two-under-par 02 for
16 holes, to go three-up for the 34
holes played. Conklin shot a par 64,
close to the best golf of his career,
but it simply wasn't good enough to !
beat McElyea, who took an amazing
six birdies.
Dick Off to Good Start
McElyea got off to a good start,
winning three out of the first four
holes. He lost the fifth, however, as
Conklin got off a spectacular iron
shot from deep in the rough. The
shot traveled some 200 yards and
landed .15 feet from the pin.
On the sixth and seventh holes,
McElyea took two straight birdies,
by virtue of a 15-foot putt and an
iron shot from the rough, that land
ed well on the green. Conklin also
birdied the seventh, but at the end
of seven holes he was four-down.
McElyea won the eighth hole, lost
the ninth, and by the end of the
tenth hole, Conklin appeared to be
completely through. On the 11th
hole, however, Conklin hit a tower
ing drive that carried some 315
yards, placing him about 20 yards
short of the green.
Seven Feet Away
His second shot landed seven feel
from the pin. He hit the putt, took
a birdie on the hole, and was only
three-down with seven holes left
to play.
On the 500 - yard, par - five 16th
! hole Conklin showed that he was
still in the game by chipping his
third shot two feet from the pin. A
birdie was practically conceded.
McElyea's third shot had placed
him five feet off the green, and with
calmness and deliberation he pitched
a 9-iron shot up to and in the pin
for a birdie and the 1951 All-Uni
versity championship.
