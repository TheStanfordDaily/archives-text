# Card Frosh Play SJ Hi
## 
### 
The Stanford frosh baseball team
will meet San Jose High on the
frosh diamond today at 3:15 p.m.
Coaches Bob Burnett and Buddy
Gmur will probably nominate Jack
Goddard (1-1) to do the hurling.
Saturday the frosh meet Cal at
Berkeley.
On Tuesday the Papooses breezed
to an easy 11 to 2 win over a pitch
erless Sequoia High. Don De Long,
who is always almost unhittable
until his arm tires, went all the way
for a change and only allowed four
hits while fanning nine.
