# Campus Sales Need Permit
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
The Student-Faculty Employment Committee stands between
the agile loot of the door-to-door salesman and the Stanford stu
dent.
The committee was established in 1948, after local travel agen
cies had set up card tables on each corner of the Quad and worried

students with their cutthroat offers
of sunny cruises and summers in
Europe.
Now, every student who wishes to
solicit on campus must have a per
mit from the committee. No firms
may solicit unless they have a stu
dent representative. Petitions the
committee has examined this quar
ter include requests to sell encyclo
pedias, hamburgers, women's cloth
ing, and summer cruises.
The committee also acts as a fact
finding and mediating board in cases
where students have disagreements
with their employers. Included here
arc hashing controversies.
If a hasher has tried to settle
a misunderstanding through the
head of his dining hall and
through the Union and still feels
he is being treated unfairly, he
can bring his case to the commit
tee. Before the committee was
formed, hashers had no place to
bring serious problems.
The student - faculty employment
committee is composed of four stu
dents and four faculty members.
One of the students is a representa
tive of ASSU Excom and at least
two of them must have been em
ployed by the University. All four
of the present members—Jim Kerr,
Mary Kilbourne, Aljcan Levin, and
Gordon Campbell—have worked at
Stanford.
Present faculty representatives are

Eugene Dils of the Placement Serv
ice; Adelc Strogcn, assistant coun
selor for women; Carlton Peterson
of the Graduate School of Business;
Dwight Adams, director of the Vil
lage; and non-voting member Mary
anna Petersen of the Placement
Service.
To gel a permit from the com
mittee, a campus representative
must submit a written petition.
The committee checks the need
for the scrvicc and makes sure
that the request breaks no Uni
versity rules.
The permit must be shown to di
rectors or resident assistants of
campus halls or Women's Row
houses before the solicitor is al
lowed in.
All decisions made by the com
mittee arc considered official. How
ever, final appeal may be made to
the president of the University. Not
one case has been appealed in four
years.
