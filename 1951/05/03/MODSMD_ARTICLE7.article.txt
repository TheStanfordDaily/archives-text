# 'Prodigious Wife' Not Up to Name
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Prodigious, in case you didn't know, means marvelous or ex
traordinary, and if these adjectives are somewhat too superlative
for the play that opened in the Little Theater last night, a few of
their less excessive relatives could certainly be applied.
We refer, of course, to the Stanford Players' production of Fede-

Rico Garcia Lorca's "The Shoemaker's
Prodigious Wife," a folk comedy of
the people who inhabit the province
of Andalucia in Spain.
Lorca, however, might not have
recognized his play—or at least not
the new opening the Stanford Play
ers inserted. Deciding, apparently,
that the play alone wouldn't run the
proper number of minutes to satisfy
a paying audience, the Players hired
the Group Andaluz, who duly mo
tored up from Sunnyvale (of all
places) to provide a 30-minute over
ture of Andalusian song, music, and
dance.
Act Diverting
Their act is diverting enough in a
vaudeville sort of way, and might be
excused on grounds of creating ap
propriate atmosphere. But Gibsons
were not served to the audience be
fore performances of "The Cocktail
Party," and the connection between
the Group Andaluz and Lorca is no
closer.
The Group Andaluz serves only to
break the evening into two very dis
tinct lumps, and even steals some of
Lorca's thunder with its hoop-la
Spanish antics. Lorca, we think,

could have gotten along very well
alone.
The Players subtitle the play "a
violent, farce," and act accordingly.
This i.s just as well, for the results are
usually delightful, particularly in the
spirited second act.
The play in Spanish us not nearly
so farcical as it seems in translation,
but this is due to the quality of the
Spanish language, which allows for
an aura of sentimentality, pathos,
and homespun humor that doesn't
seem ludicrous or melodramatic. The
loss is unfortunate, but is the fault of
the English language and the price
of translation.
Morgan Stock turns in a fine per
formance as the Shoemaker, par
ticularly when disguised as the Sto
ryteller. In the title role, Jacque
line Mclvcr is good, though a bit
too much given to dramatic pauses
and poses between lines.
Highly Amusing
Virginia Hamilton, a.s an outraged
townswoman, and Joan Mauritsen
and Janet Karahadian as her bick
ering daughters, are highly amus
ing.
Robert. Hagopinn is a perfect amo
rous Mayor, four - times married,
four-times widowed, and still tear
ing to go in his own slightly pom
pous manner.
The entire cast, in fact, holds to
as high and consistent a standard of
acting as we have seen in these
parts for a long time, though of
course the farcical nature of the
roles is not. particularly demanding.
All of this adds up to an enjoyable
and colorful evening.

four-times widowed, and still tear

The entire cast, in fact, holds to

acting as we have seen in these

course the farcical nature of the
roles is not. particularly demanding.
All of this adds up to an enjoyable
and colorful evening.

Prodigious, in case you didn't know, means marvelous or ex
traordinary, and if these adjectives are somewhat too superlative
for the play that opened in the Little Theater last night, a few of
their less excessive relatives could certainly be applied.
We refer, of course, to the Stanford Players' production of Fede-

Rico Garcia Lorca's "The Shoemaker's
Prodigious Wife," a folk comedy of
the people who inhabit the province
of Andalucia in Spain.
Lorca, however, might not have
recognized his play—or at least not
the new opening the Stanford Play
ers inserted. Deciding, apparently,
that the play alone wouldn't run the
proper number of minutes to satisfy
a paying audience, the Players hired
the Group Andaluz, who duly mo
tored up from Sunnyvale (of all
places) to provide a 30-minute over
ture of Andalusian song, music, and
dance.
Act Diverting
Their act is diverting enough in a
vaudeville sort of way, and might be
excused on grounds of creating ap
propriate atmosphere. But Gibsons
were not served to the audience be
fore performances of "The Cocktail
Party," and the connection between
the Group Andaluz and Lorca is no
closer.
The Group Andaluz serves only to
break the evening into two very dis
tinct lumps, and even steals some of
Lorca's thunder with its hoop-la
Spanish antics. Lorca, we think,

could have gotten along very well
alone.
The Players subtitle the play "a
violent, farce," and act accordingly.
This i.s just as well, for the results are
usually delightful, particularly in the
spirited second act.
The play in Spanish us not nearly
so farcical as it seems in translation,
but this is due to the quality of the
Spanish language, which allows for
an aura of sentimentality, pathos,
and homespun humor that doesn't
seem ludicrous or melodramatic. The
loss is unfortunate, but is the fault of
the English language and the price
of translation.
Morgan Stock turns in a fine per
formance as the Shoemaker, par
ticularly when disguised as the Sto
ryteller. In the title role, Jacque
line Mclvcr is good, though a bit
too much given to dramatic pauses
and poses between lines.
Highly Amusing
Virginia Hamilton, a.s an outraged
townswoman, and Joan Mauritsen
and Janet Karahadian as her bick
ering daughters, are highly amus
