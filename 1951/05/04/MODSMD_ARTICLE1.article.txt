## Mac Arthur Tells Senate His Story 
### 
WASHINGTON. May :J (UP)
(ion. Douglas Mac Arthur told a
Senate investigating committee to
ri ay that events in Korea and Asia
will not affect Russia's overall choice
of peace or wax, although they might
change the Kremlin's timetable of
conquest.
Fie said Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek has about 500.000 "excel
lent' Chinese Nationalist troops on
Formosa who "should he used" to
ease the pressure on United Na
tions forces in Korea.
Mac Arthur urged the United
States to smash Rod China by sea
and air — fighting 'alone if neces
sary"—and angrily accused the ad
ministration of wasting "thousands"
of American lives in Korea by
lighting a "stalemate" war.
The United States should adopt
this battle plan for early victory in
Korea, he said: (1) Bomb Chinese
bases and supply lines in Korea; (2)
put Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist
troops into the field; and (3) block
ade the China coast.
