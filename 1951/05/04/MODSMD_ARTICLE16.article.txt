# Cal To Host Stanford
## Trackmen Tomorrow Favor Cards In Big Meet 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
A victory-starved Indian cin
der team travels to Berkeley to
morrow to face a steadily im
proving California squad. Ti n
Cards will bs slightly favored to
score Stanford's 28th win again: t
25 defeats and two ties in tho
series which extends back to
1893.
The California and Stanford frn:-h
meet will he combined with tin
varsity affair, each frosh race im
mediately preceding its varsity
counterpart, except in the two-mile
which wltl be combined. The mecf
will be held on Cal's Edwards Field,
thr field events beginning at 12:110
and the-running events at 1:50.
The Bear outfit, which was rated
as one of the weakest in the school's
history at the start, of thr* season,
has shown such great improvement,
that it. poses a serious threat to th"
Card thinclads.
The top races of the day should
be the sprint duels between ti- •
Bears' Jim Plessas arid Stanford',
trio of Wilbur Taylor, Maurice Par
sons, and Ronnie Buck. Taylor ha
seasonal bests of 9.9 and 21.3. The
Berkeley ace has clockings of 9 '.)
and 21.8.
Close Races
Parsons turned in a 9.9 century
against Ox.y. Buck, who raced a 0 7
100 last year, hasn't competed much
this campaign but will probably
face the Bears.
Other close races should develop
in the 440 and low hurdles. Card
quarter-miler Bill Storum with a
48.8 relay timing will attempt to
match strides with Jim Hutchm on
who has a 43 flat relay clocking.
In the low barriers Bob Mathi
at 24 will be pitted against Pi ... ,
who sped 23.8 last Saturday. Indian
Bob Bryan ran 24.1 against, tho Tro
j jans in his first race after a loiv< la
I off, and could easily take the even*

A victory-starved Indian cin
