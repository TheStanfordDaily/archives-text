UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., May 3
'J lie United States today pro
posed an arms embargo against
Communist China "so that no sol
dier in Korea should be the target
of a bullet manufactured in the free
world."
The plan was outlined at a private
meeting of the United Nations sanc
tions committee and American Del
egate Ernest A. Gross said it would
be embodied in a formal resolution
early next week. However, it was
reliably reported that there was
considerable opposition among some
of the 12 committee members to
taking such a step against the Pei
ping government at this particular
time.
