# Religious Meetings on Campus
## 
### 
An old controversy is here again the ques
tion o! whether or not to allow denominational
iehgious groups to use University owned build
ings lor meetings.
lnterfaith Council, a group composed of stu
dents of various religions, is now preparing
a petition to the Board ol Trustees asking for a
i (.interpretation of the founding grant so as to
let denominational groups use University
owned buildings.
The founding grant explicitly provides that
the University must be kept entirely free from
all denominational alliances. However, under
a clarifying statement released by the Public
J1 zeroises Committee and the Student Affairs
Committee in 1946, a modification of the found
ing grant was agreed upon.
This modification, representing a liberal in
terpretation ot the founding grant, has the effect
(jf allowing denominational groups to use the
Women's Clubhouse and the Men's Faculty
Clubhouse on campus.
but the Women's Clubhouse is too small to
lake care ol a crammed schedule of meetings,
while the faculty Clubhouse is small and iso
lated. Thus many religious groups must meet
in Palo Alto churches or in homes of members.
fnterfaith Council, acting as a sounding board
for the groups, lists sound reasons in its bid
for a reinterpretation, such as inconvenience
o! having to travel to Palo Alto for meetings

and difficulty in attracting new membeis when
meetings can't be held on campus.
It's not a question of fife or death lor denom
inational groups, but rather a question involv
ing convenience and better group morale.
The intent of the founding grant was for re
ligious needs of the students to be met through
Ihe interdenominational Memorial Church and
the University Chaplain. It was thought by the
founders that students who wanted denomina
tional affiliation could easily use Palo Alto
churches.
However, the very fact that year after year
the same complaint is heard hom the groups
indicates that a real grievance exists.
We feel that the Board of Trustees would be
wise to re-examine the picture, and give consid
eraiion to a reinterpretation allowing the pro
posed change.
Another suggestion worth thinking about is
for Stanford to form some sort of religious foun
dation on campus, such as UCLA and North
western have adopted. This would call for an
enlarged Chaplain's staff, so that the denomina
tional groups would still be under University
supervision.
At any rate.Jnterfaith Council is using a con
structive approach in attempting to solve the
problem of religious meetings on campus.

a petition to the Board ol Trustees asking for a
i (.interpretation of the founding grant so as to
let denominational groups use University
owned buildings.
The founding grant explicitly provides that
the University must be kept entirely free from
all denominational alliances. However, under
a clarifying statement released by the Public
J1 zeroises Committee and the Student Affairs
Committee in 1946, a modification of the found
ing grant was agreed upon.
This modification, representing a liberal in
terpretation ot the founding grant, has the effect
(jf allowing denominational groups to use the
Women's Clubhouse and the Men's Faculty
Clubhouse on campus.
but the Women's Clubhouse is too small to
lake care ol a crammed schedule of meetings,
while the faculty Clubhouse is small and iso
lated. Thus many religious groups must meet
in Palo Alto churches or in homes of members.
fnterfaith Council, acting as a sounding board
for the groups, lists sound reasons in its bid
for a reinterpretation, such as inconvenience
o! having to travel to Palo Alto for meetings

and difficulty in attracting new membeis when
meetings can't be held on campus.
It's not a question of fife or death lor denom
inational groups, but rather a question involv
ing convenience and better group morale.
The intent of the founding grant was for re
ligious needs of the students to be met through
Ihe interdenominational Memorial Church and
the University Chaplain. It was thought by the
founders that students who wanted denomina
tional affiliation could easily use Palo Alto
churches.
However, the very fact that year after year
the same complaint is heard hom the groups
indicates that a real grievance exists.
We feel that the Board of Trustees would be
wise to re-examine the picture, and give consid
eraiion to a reinterpretation allowing the pro
posed change.
Another suggestion worth thinking about is
for Stanford to form some sort of religious foun
dation on campus, such as UCLA and North
western have adopted. This would call for an
enlarged Chaplain's staff, so that the denomina
tional groups would still be under University
supervision.
At any rate.Jnterfaith Council is using a con
structive approach in attempting to solve the
problem of religious meetings on campus.

An old controversy is here again the ques
