# BULL SESSION
## 
### BOB SPIELMANN 
Ah, the sweet, peaceful atmosphere of Stanford's
library in the evening when the sun is setting and
Lag is full of people and Kossott's is lilling. Only
Ihe distracting gnawing of the bookworms as they
noisily chew their way through Plutarch's Lives, di
gesting the knowledge, disturbs the tranquil concen
tration of the scholars —«: 11 two of them.
Being still innocent and trusting, as yet not having
been subjected to the cruel disillusionment of the
world, I guilelessly believed that as tilings were so
lh"v would always remain. And after having had a
hoi I sun bath at the lake, 1 hobbled over to the libe
with the idea of doing some quiet stewing er study
ing.
As I entered on tiptoe, not wishing to cause the
bookworms alarm. I was caught by a sudden gust
ol words and blown back outsde the door. Unde
terred, I made it the second time.
dancing about, I was struck by the large number
of individuals lounging about as if at a tea-party, ex
cept there wasn't any tea. All were holding quite
i nergetic conversation.-', speaking very excitedly and
in rapid jerky motions as if they were afraid someone
might interrupt them before they'd had a chance to
finish what they were saying. Which was obviously
extremely important.
" Vly gosh." I said to myself, "this isn't the library
I've wandered into, 'i 11is is the Stanford Debating
Club."
Hut on further checking I discovered this was in
deed the library. Or what had once been the library,
' inee it didn't have much resemblance to it any more.
'J hen a thought struck me. Perhaps the model UN
had been so successful that they had decided to move
tht real UN to Stanford. This was quite possible.
Andrei (iroinyko had accused the U.S. of trying
it/ turn the heads of the USSIt satellites. 'Die dele
gate from Byelo-Russia had become swaysiok on
the Hist story of the New York UN building. I
groaned. Here it was. 'flic UN on the Stanford

campus for good. The end of all peace. No more
would I be able to hear (he peaceful crunching of
the bookworms.
Deciding to be brave, 112 entered (he reserve book
room, the pleasant musical babble which sounded as
if the tower of Babel had just met its end Moating in
through the open door. Taking out "A Guide to Better
Understanding of the Soap Opera," by Sud.s & Suds,
I began to study my home economics.
Of course the incessant giggles, screams, and rav
ings in the hall did not disturb me. After a while
you get sort of conditioned to them. There's no
doubt but had the racket suddenly stopped, several
of the persons in the room would have screamed,
perhaps become violent. They'd been there too long.
The sudden quiet would have been too much for
their weakened minds.
I was taking notes. They were copious ones. Ad
mittedly this wasn't much use. Usually when 1 go to
refer to them I can't read my own handwriting. My
mind kept wandering. Of course the conversations in
the hall weren't distracting. It was purely my imagi
nation. I did not look at my notes. It's a good thing.
One of them read like this:
"The soap opera has become an integral part of
American life. There is a psychological basis for the
soap opera because you know I met the cutest Alpha
Alpha Kho last night and I think he's a member of
the varsity ping pong team and maybe he'll even give
me his sweater to wear. Isn't it just simply too too
thrilling, 1 don't know why the advertisers are trying
to increase the standards of the soap operas."
That's the story. The unfortunate part is that it's
repeated day after day: the same old gossip, loud
and long, hanging into the ears of a few would-he
students.
I have only one request.
Have a heart, people, for the guys who've got mid
terms in the morning. This is the first lime they've
cracked a book all quarter. Alter all one of them
might be YOU.
