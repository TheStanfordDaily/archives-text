# School Trustees Negotiate for Site
## 
### 
Trustees of the Menlo Park Ele-
J mentary School District are nego-
I tiating with Stanford for purchase
| of a site, in the southwest corner of
' the district, on which to build their
proposed Oak Knoll School.
Price of the site was' discussed
Monday night with E. S. Ervvin,
assistant business manager, and two
proposals were drawn up to be pre
: sen ted to University authorities.
Because of Stanford deed restric
tions, the site must be taken by
! means of a "friendly condemnation"
suit at the price agreed on in the
| current negotiations.
Stanford has leased adjacent land
to a subdivider tor development o!'
a residential area.
