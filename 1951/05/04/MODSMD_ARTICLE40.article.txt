# Indian, Trojan Horsehiders Victims of Jupiter Pluvius
## 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
The rains came.
The fourth and final meeting be
tween Coach Everett Dean's horse
liiders and the rampaging USC Tro
jans, scheduled for this afternoon,
tias been postponed. However, the
Trojans were also slated to meet
Santa Clara in Broncoville in a
double - header Saturday. If the
heavens should clear, USC will Hy
north in time for their Santa Clara
games and meet Stanford either
Monday or Tuesday.
The Cards naturally will he out
for a repeat performance of their
last I!SC outing when Rog Osen
baugh made clowns out of the
Trojan talent and tamed them
nicely C-l. Following this down
lull to their dignity, the Tvojans
blew another to California, hut
still lead the CIBA pack with a
7-2 record. Stanford is currently
at 5-5, with noliodv knowing for
si! re whether the Santa Clara
games count or not.
Unless ringmasters Ev Dean and
Rod Dedeaux decide otherwise, the
.scene will remain the same as the
la.it one, Rog Osenbaugh vs. Tom
Lovrich, and identical starting line
up.s.
The Trojans received an addition
al boost last week when first sacker
AI Lamont returned to action. Bitj
Al was a leading hitter in the CIBA
last year but was sidelined this sea
son with a bad knee. The Trojans
also lost Don Herman and Bill
Prince via the injury route, and
regulars Rudy Regalado, Jack
Schlarb, and Ed Hookstratten were
taken by the armed forces.
Tomorrow the Cards venture up
California way to meet Clint Evans'
Bears, who have lost six out of their
last seven to the Indians.
Big Joe Chez will crank up for
Stanford, opposing either Ed Mayer
or Bill Nishita.
This will be ;\ big baseball
weekend for the Cards, and by
next Monday it will he pretty well
known whether they are still in
the race or not. At present they

have only one .300 hitler, Jack
Shepard, at . in the starting
lineup. Following him conies
pitcher Bob Murphy, with . ;i(>s,
and if things continue, he may
iiml himself and his hig hat out
in the outfield. The same goes for
reserve infielder Dick Cole, who's
clouting a lusty .315. After this
trio, the hatting averages trail off
considerably.
As for the pitching, Joe Chez and
Roger Osenbaugh have done credi
tably but more help is needed. In
contrast, USC has five pitchers with
CIBA victories. If Bob Murphy, Jim
Claypool, or Tony Stellar can step
in to fill the pitching gap. the Cards
might be on their way toward the
PCC pennant which is still far from
lust.


LEADING HITTERâ€”SyI McNinch. the only Cal batter over the .300 mark in CIBA play this years,
stands fifth in the standings with an average of .372. He leads the league in hits with 16. Mc-
was spiked in last weekend's game with USC, however, the lanky first sacker will be back
in the lineup, swinging from his familiar clean-up slot when Stanford meets the Bears for the sec
ond time this season at Berkeley tomorrow afternoon.
