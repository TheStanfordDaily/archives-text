# Notmen Meet Strong Bruins
## 
### 
Weather permitting, Stanford's
varsity netmen, improving but still
winless in PCC competition, will
host the powerful UCLA Bruins at
2 p.m. today on the Indian courts.
The boys in the Baby Blue have
lost their ranking singles star. Herb
Flamm, by graduation, but still
boast a team that is tied for first in
conference play.
Robin Willner, rccent victor in
the intercollegiate division of the
Ojai invitational tournament, will
probably play first singles for the
Bruins.
Willner, who has been improving
consistently, replaces Jack Schu
macher as the top man, and Schu
macher will undoubtedly play in the
second slot.
For Stanford. Coach Bob Renker
will start the same lineup that he
has been using regularly recently.
Charlie Hick-ox, George Gentry,
Tom Lewyn, Bob Sibert, Dean
Brinkman, and Vince Schmieder
will play singles for the Indians, and
Phil Neilsen will substitute for
Brinkman in the doubles.
Stanford's scheduled final tuneup
for today's match, scheduled yester
day with San Francisco State, was
canceled becau.se of wet grounds.
