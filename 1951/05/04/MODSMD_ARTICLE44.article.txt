# Seattle Area Donates To Card Crew
## 
### 
Royal Brougham, sports editor of
the Seattle Post-intelligencer, has
j turned out to be a very good friend
j of the Stanford crew.
Brougham went to work raising
j funds in the Seattle area when he
I heard of the crew's financial plight.
Lack of money would have meant
1 that they would not have been able
; to go to Seattle on May 12 for a
- three-way meet with the Univer
sity of Washington and the Univer
sity of California, the two top shells
I in the country.
Bruogham was able to scrape up
' nearly $1,000 from various inter
j ested parties, including a contribu
| tion from Greater Seattle, Inc., a
I local booster organization. In ud
| dition, Brougham made arrange
; ments with a local hotel in Seattle
j to provide free rooms and meals
j for the Indians.
The money received will enable
I the varsity shell to make the trip,
| and presently the crew is trying to
make arrangements to enable the
frosh boat to go along. The frosh
have a good crew this year, and
; with some racing experience, will
j contribute greatly to the Card var
| sity next year.
Bad weather has prevented the
j Indians from making time trials this
I week.
