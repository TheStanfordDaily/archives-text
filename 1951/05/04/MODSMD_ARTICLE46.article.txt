# Card Swimmers Take On Trojans
## 
### IRWIN JOHNSON 
This afternoon Stanford's best swimming team ever holds its last
i home meet, against USC at 2:30 in the Encina Pools.
The Indian swimmers, fourth in the NCAA this year, are out to
wax the once-mighty Trojans, to gain revenge for the 50 to 25 lacing
they received last year.
The medley relay, first event, will find the team of Bert Holiday,

Bob Frojen, and Bruce Putnam
swimming for Stanford against the
trio of Wally Wolf, Jim Ross, and
A'l Masarik. Holiday should be sec
ond to Wolf by a yard, since the 194S
Olympic swimmer from Troy tours
the 100-yard backstroke in GO sec
onds. Frojen should make up the
difference and more on Ross in the
breast-stroke, and Putnam, whose
best 100 freestyle time is 52.0,
; should beat Masarik by a yard.
I Score five for the Cards.
In the 220, Pete Cole and Bobby
Thompson, co - record - holders at
2:10.0, will go against Frank Tan-
I ner. First and second here give
Stanford 13 points to SC's 1.
Bob Crisemer and Chuck Kelly
will probably swim the 50 for Stan-

; ford, although soph George Mowat
! and Bob Wycoff are both
enough to beat USC's Jim Utter
back. In time trials this week,
Grisemer did 23.0 with a regular
start, Mowat did 23.6. Kelly 23.8.
and Wycoff 23.9.
The diving should be the best
! event, with Bill Glathe, sensational
| Farm junior, vying against National
; AAU tower champ Johnny McCor
-1 mack. Give SC first and third, and
the score stands Stanford 24. USC 8.
The 100 freestyle should be very
| close between Putnam, Phil Chap
! man, and Masarik. Chapman, the
forgotten man on the Stanford
| squad, has been very consistent at
j 52.4-52.9. and might sneak in for
, second place behind Putnam. Give
i him third and it's Stanford 30, USC
j 11.
Wolf should win the backstroke
j hands down over Indians Pierre
Hathaway and Dick Bennett or Don
; Weeden. Wolf's best is 2:14, while
Bennett, who is suffering from the
after effects of his NROTC shots,
has done 2:23. Hathaway has done
2:28 and Weeden 2:27. Stanford 34.
Trojans 16.
| In the breaststroke, Bob Frojen

should get the PCC record of 2:22.4
which he has been shooting for for
the last two meets. Soph Ashley
Jones, a transfer from Glendale JC,
should be able to beat Ross for the
place position. The score is now
Stanford 42, USC 17.
Cole should also get the PCC rec
ord in his event, the 440 freestyle.
The record is 4:43 by Ralph Sala,
and Pete did 4:39 in practice last
week. Swimming second man for
the Cards will be either Captain
Ernie Polte or Bob Kidder. The
two swam a dead heat quarter-mile
in 4:59 this week. Figure Tanner
for second and the score is 48 to 20
for Stanford.
Coach Tom Haynle is swimming
his best lreestyle relay combination
in an attempt to break still another
record. The team of Holiday (52.5),
Chapman (52.5), Putnam (51.5),
and Thompson (51.5) should be
under 3:30 for the 400-yard relay,
and half a pool length ahead of
SC's team of Wolf, Masarik, Utter
back, and Kit Horn. This would
give a final score of 55 for the
Indians and 20 for Southern Cal.
