# Underdog Frosh Cindermen Meet Powerful Bear Squad
## 
### KEITH MULROONEY 
An underdog squad of Papoose i
trackaters will meet California's
"greatest ever" frosh at Berkeley
tomorrow, determined to make a
better showing than the experts
have predicted for them. The meet
will be held in conjunction with the
varsity fracas, the field events be- |
ginning at 12:30 and the running |
events at 1:50.
Off best times, the Bearcubs
should be favored to win 10 of 14
events plus the relay. But Dave
Fletcher and Warren Sanborn,
Cardbabe co-captains for the meet,
are plugging for several of their |
boys to pull upsets.
Fletcher himself could easily snag
one of these surprise victories. His
1:59 880 effort stacks up well against
Berkeley ite Jack Nelson's 1:58.4
mark.
Sanborn likewise could turn the
tables. His mile best of 4:37 is quite
a bit shy of Norm Green's 4:25.5 '

j time, but the ex-Glendale' star has
i only run the mile three times in his
life. His 1320 clocking of 3:17 as an
11-grader shows he can go the dis
j tanee.
Cal seems certain of victory in the
: sprints, two - mile, shot put, and
broad jump. Dashman Guy Black
| burn, with bests of 9.6 and 21.5,
looks untouchable. Two - miler
Verne Thornburg is about 30 sec
onds ahead of the leading Card
eight-lapper.
Four Berkeley broad jumpers
over 22 ft. should sweep the event.
| Weight man Hal Norris has heaved
j the iron ball 48 ft., almost two feet
better than the first Indian has put.
Although the Cal relay team has
run in the 3:25'5, Papoose Coach
Ray Dean can assemble four men
who could best the Bear ioursome:
Fred George, 49.8; Don Carlson,
49.9 (relay lap); Bob Bly, 50.8;
| Fletcher, 51.1 (relay lap), or Larry
I Broeren, 51.5 (relay lap).
