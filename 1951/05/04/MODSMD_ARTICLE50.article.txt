# Parrot Singsr 'Who's Blue?' Tune
## 
### 
With the <iid of a live parrot and
fowl vocal interpretations by Steve
Blumberg, this year's Spring Show
will be strictly for the birds.
Gabriel (played in person by Chico,
courtesy of a Mcnlo Park pot shop,
and in voice by Blumberg) will be
under the spotlight for a major part
of the performance, and although Ik
will be confined to a cage, he no
doubt will be quite active.
While the accompanying picturc
was being taken, Steve found out just
how active Chico could I c.
The owner of the pet shop told
Steve, upon placing the parrot on hi?
finger, that if he had confidence, the
bird would do no harm, but if he was
nervous, Gabriel might just take a
peck here and there.
At that Steve's fingers began to
move, and Gabriel as forewarned be
gan to peck. But unfortunately for
the "voice of the parrot," the pho
tographer was just about to snap the
shutter. So while Gabriel romped
up and down Steve's arm, the latter
had to remain motionless and pose.
Gabriel's part in "Who's Blue?"
will be confined vocally to a few
lines, among which will be "Fornus
Bornus." Hie parrot has picked up
this phrase from his owner and bene
factor, Chris Dawson, the comedian
hero, played by George Denny.
Although the meaning of "Fornus
Bornus has not been revealed by
authors Jack Nisbct and Wally White,
the cast has bgen rehearsing verse
after verse of a song bearing the same
name.
Just where the parrot and "fornus
bornus" fit in will remain a mystery
until "Who's Blue?" is presented at
Memorial Auditorium, May 17, 18.
and 19.
