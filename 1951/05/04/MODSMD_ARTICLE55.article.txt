SACRAMENTO, May 3 (UP) â€” I
Two bills to tax the profit out of |
crime, the first anti-racket meas- j
ures to reach his desk, were signed
into law today by Gov. Earl Warren. I

Warren's action made California
the first state in the nation to enact
laws prohibiting Ramblers from
making the so-called legitimate de
duction on illegitimate activities.
