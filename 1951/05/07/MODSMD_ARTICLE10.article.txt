ALL ON THE UP AND UP—There was no fear of the Dean
when Carolyn Thomson (left), Sara Emerson, and Mary Ellen
Long visited the fourth floor room of Wade Acton (center), and
John Lauderbach yesterday at Encina's open house. Stanford
coeds wandered through the halls of the vast dorm for the first
time in their life. (See story, page 4.)
