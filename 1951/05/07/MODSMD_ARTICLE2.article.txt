BULLETIN!
Kill I ,riser lias been lired as Stanford football conch

Athletic Director A 1 Masters announced that the SAB unani
mously decided to oust Bill Leiser only 60 football minutes after
he had taken the coaching job last Friday. Also fired were Curly
Grieve and Hal Wood, co-coach and assistant coach of the Reds;
and Bud Spencer, Nelson Cullenward, and Ray Haywood of the

Whiles.
(The Whiles lied (he Reds, 27 to
27. in a Stanford intra-squad foot- ;
ball game played at Stanford Sta
dium Friday.)
One of the reasons for the dismissal
action was believed to be rooted in
the clothes the Chronicle sports edi- J
tor wore. Me was garbed in a fire- j
engine-rod sweatshirt, which was
okay, but he wore a cap of a foreign I
blue hue.
(The Whites scored first. In a 1
play do ignod by Spencer. Bill Mc- I
Coll passed 55 yards in the air to j
half Wev Laubschcr who went to
the Red cJit. The Whites fumbled
<m (he one-yard stripe and Leiser's
Reds recovered. Bob Meyers j
kicked, and the Whites drove to the j
:10. where quarterback Bobby flar
rctl passed to end John Steinberg |
in the end zone. Garrett convert- '
cd.)
At the beginning of the game, a j
photographer led the 1,500 students i
in a Bill Leiser" yell. As the j
tide turned against the Reds, how- j
evoi - , the gathering began to chant, j
"Fire Leiser."
When interviewed after the game,
Leiser said, "They can't fire me. 1 re
sign. 1 can only take one of these j
things a year. I think we had a mora! j
victory since they had McColl."
Grieve agreed.
(The Reds came back to tic it up
as Gary Kerkorian hit half Billy j
Heilbron with a .'5O-yard aerial and
end Srm Morley with another 30-
yarder for the score. Kerkorian i
added the conversion, 7 to 7.
(Leiser and Grieve's Reds went
ahead, 14 to 7, as Kerkorian con- j
netted with Morley with a 15-yard
payoff pitch. Dick Horn sparked a
White 50-yard scoring drive by ;
flinging 13-yard passes to half Wcs
Laubschcr and McColl. Fullback
Skip Crist boomed for the final 7
yards. Horn's conversion attempt I
hi( (ho crossbar, 11 to 13.)
One of the reasons for the hard
fought g;imc was the inspiring pep
talks given before the contest. Lei- j
ser said, "I'm not going to give you j
much of a pop talk; 112 just want, to
point out thnt it doesn't cost much
money to hire a team to go out and j
lose. - '
Co coach Grieve told his Red play- >
crs, "All i ight, go out there and win. [
boys. 1 don't want to go back to the
ofiice with a losing team."
In the Whites' quarters, Coach |
Cullenward of the Call-Bulletin
whipped up team morale by an- |
nouneing, "Listen, boys, I want you to j
go out on that field and give it, all j
you've got! Wo coaches have got a j
lot on this game."
(The Reds moved to a 21 to 13 ad-

vantage when Meyers went over
center on a trap play, tut to his
right, and proceeded 18 yards to the
goal. The Whites narrowed it to 21
to 20 when McColl huttonhooked
and accepted a 15-yard scoring
aerial from Dick Horn.)
Co-codchcs Grieve and Lciscr camc
to a parting of the ways at halftime.
Grieve said to the team, "Okay, I
want you to pass this half." Leiser
said, "I want you to run this half."
Kcrkorian suggested that they run.
(The Whites pieced together a
39-yard drive with Laubscher go
ing over for the final yard. Garrett
converted to give the Whites a 27
to 21 lead.)
Leiser proved to be a nervous
coach. He lit one cigarette with an
other and paced the sidelines like a
caged lion. Grieve kept shouting in a
shrill voice from the sidelines,
"You're hot, Gary. You're hot!" The
115-pound Wood spent his time run
ning between Lciier and Grieve and
being brushed off by both.
(The Reds tied the game at 27-
ull as Harry Iltigasian received a
Kcrkorian pass, eluded two defend
ers, and skipped over the goal. Kcr
korian missed the conversion.)
When the score was tied at 27
apiece, and everything was tense,
Grieve asked, "What's the score?"
Leiser said, "I think both teams have
27. Wood said, "No, it's 26 to 26."
Someone informed them it was 27-
all.
Leiser and Grieve finished their
coaching debut in a blaze of glory as
the players hoisted the two to their
shoulders at the end of the game.
McColl and Horn shouted, "A darn
nice game, Coach (Leiser)." McColl
and Horn were on the opposing side.
Although no successor to Leiser
has been named, rumors have it that
a Chronicle sports writer named Tay
lor is favored for the job.

Reds recovered. Bob Meyers j

At the beginning of the game, a j
photographer led the 1,500 students i
in a Bill Leiser" yell. As the j
tide turned against the Reds, how- j
evoi - , the gathering began to chant, j
"Fire Leiser."
When interviewed after the game,
Leiser said, "They can't fire me. 1 re
sign. 1 can only take one of these j
things a year. I think we had a mora! j
victory since they had McColl."
Grieve agreed.
(The Reds came back to tic it up
as Gary Kerkorian hit half Billy j
Heilbron with a .'5O-yard aerial and
end Srm Morley with another 30-
yarder for the score. Kerkorian i
added the conversion, 7 to 7.
(Leiser and Grieve's Reds went
ahead, 14 to 7, as Kerkorian con- j
netted with Morley with a 15-yard
payoff pitch. Dick Horn sparked a
White 50-yard scoring drive by ;
flinging 13-yard passes to half Wcs
Laubschcr and McColl. Fullback
Skip Crist boomed for the final 7
yards. Horn's conversion attempt I
hi( (ho crossbar, 11 to 13.)
One of the reasons for the hard
fought g;imc was the inspiring pep
talks given before the contest. Lei- j
ser said, "I'm not going to give you j
much of a pop talk; 112 just want, to
point out thnt it doesn't cost much
money to hire a team to go out and j
lose. - '
Co coach Grieve told his Red play- >
crs, "All i ight, go out there and win. [
boys. 1 don't want to go back to the
ofiice with a losing team."
In the Whites' quarters, Coach |
Cullenward of the Call-Bulletin
whipped up team morale by an- |
nouneing, "Listen, boys, I want you to j
go out on that field and give it, all j
you've got! Wo coaches have got a j
lot on this game."
(The Reds moved to a 21 to 13 ad-

vantage when Meyers went over
center on a trap play, tut to his
right, and proceeded 18 yards to the
goal. The Whites narrowed it to 21
to 20 when McColl huttonhooked
and accepted a 15-yard scoring
aerial from Dick Horn.)
Co-codchcs Grieve and Lciscr camc
to a parting of the ways at halftime.
Grieve said to the team, "Okay, I
want you to pass this half." Leiser
said, "I want you to run this half."
Kcrkorian suggested that they run.
(The Whites pieced together a
39-yard drive with Laubscher go
ing over for the final yard. Garrett
converted to give the Whites a 27
to 21 lead.)
Leiser proved to be a nervous
coach. He lit one cigarette with an
other and paced the sidelines like a
caged lion. Grieve kept shouting in a
shrill voice from the sidelines,
"You're hot, Gary. You're hot!" The
115-pound Wood spent his time run
ning between Lciier and Grieve and
being brushed off by both.
(The Reds tied the game at 27-
ull as Harry Iltigasian received a
Kcrkorian pass, eluded two defend
ers, and skipped over the goal. Kcr
korian missed the conversion.)
When the score was tied at 27
apiece, and everything was tense,
Grieve asked, "What's the score?"
Leiser said, "I think both teams have
27. Wood said, "No, it's 26 to 26."
Someone informed them it was 27-
all.
Leiser and Grieve finished their
coaching debut in a blaze of glory as
the players hoisted the two to their
shoulders at the end of the game.
McColl and Horn shouted, "A darn
nice game, Coach (Leiser)." McColl
and Horn were on the opposing side.
Although no successor to Leiser
has been named, rumors have it that
a Chronicle sports writer named Tay
lor is favored for the job.
