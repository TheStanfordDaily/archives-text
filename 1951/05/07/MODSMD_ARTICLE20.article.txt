# BULL SESSION
## 
### CHUCK GETCHELL 
The ingenious brains of the Committee on Public
Exercises have, to nobody's particular surprise, out
foxed the Post Office censors again. Volume CXXV,
Number C, of their spicy little publication, "Stanford
University Calendar," has somehow slipped through
the mails unchallenged and has Hooded the campus
once' mole,* to be tacked up blatantly on bulletin
Ijoards and to be read by the public at large, including
professors' little girls, visiting ministers, and members
of the Board of Trustees.
How long the committee can succeed in getting away
with it is a matter of some speculation. At any rate,
there is no evidence that they are ready to make any
concessions to the blue noses, as readers of this week's
subversive sheet can beat witness. All in all, we're
promised as gay a seven days a.s we've seen around
here in a long time.
The Department of Biological Sciences kicks off this
afternoon it 4:15 with a seminar on " 'Biotype Forma
tion in Calamagrostis purpurea,' Dr. Axel Nygren,
Koom 43, Jordan Hall. Students, faculty, and visitors
am welcome." If you want a good seat, you'd better be
over there by 3:30; and don't plan on getting home be
fore the wee hours.
These boys don't take all their biology from dry
old seminar papers, so it will be no surprise if the
speakers, students, faculty, and visitors pile in their
cars and run up to Fisherman's Wharf to take a look
at some Calamagrostis purpurea in the flesh. Or is
il the shell? Well, we can go along and find out.
Be sure to save Tuesday afternoon lor the Depart
ment of Physics Journal Club meeting at 4:15. " 'Gen
eral Aspects of the Turbulence Problem,' Professor
J. M. Burgers of the University of Delft, Holland.
Koom 372* Physics Building. Students, faculty, and
visitors are welcome." The subject is so broad that
anything can luippen, and those who know say that
the good Professor may even break out a couple of
cases of Heineken's which he brought from Delft
especially for the occasion.
Which will put us all in good spirits for the Tuesday
Evening Series at 7:30. "Folk-dance program by Stan
lord Hoedowners. Auspices, Committee on Public Ex

ercises. Auditorium, Memorial Hall. The public is in
vited." And it usually accepts on Tuesday evening, in
the persons of Castilleja girls and Palo Alto dowagers,
all of whom converge in buses at 7 and fill up the good
seats. The costumes can probably be seen better from
the balcony, anyway.
Wednesday is apparently to be a day of recupera
tion. The only thing on the calendar is the Candle
light Service, 9:00 p.m. "Organ meditation, Scripture
reading and prayer. Memorial Church. Students and
faculty are welcome." The committee knows how far
it can go. If it's going to advertise and condone ribald
biological seminars that rock Jordan Hall, it has to be
responsible for mollifying the decent and conservative
elements that do, after all, still exist on the campus.
Thursday the indefatigable Department of Physics
Journal Club will be at it again at 4:15. This time it's
" 'Observations on the Structure of Evaporated
Films,' Professor Kobley C. Williams, University of
California. Koom 372, Physics Building. Students,
faculty, and visitors are welcome." Your guess is as
good as mine, but sounds like something to do with
'•.YlanOn." These Cal men are sly ones.
Also on the calendar for Thursday (at 2:15) is the
"Oral Examination of Kobert Duane Wirt for the De
gree of Doctor of Philosophy. Room 17, Education
Building. Major: Psychology; Minor: None." Stu
dents, faculty, and visitors are not invited. Mr. Wirt
probably wishes that he wasn't, either. (Greeting
cards, baskets of fruit, flowers, and other congratula
tory offerings may presumably be deposited outside of
Koom 17.)
Friday, May 11. "4:30 p.m.—Lecture. Theodore
Morrison, Harvard University. Auspices. Creative
Writing Center. IJttle Theater, Memorial Hall. The
public is invited." On two conditions, that is. No
shoving in line, and no snickering in the back rows
if Mr. Morrison turns out to have a Groton accent.
"Major Athletic Eevent" is on tap for Saturday, May
12. "1:30 p.m.—Varsity Baseball. University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles vs. Stanford University. Sunken
Diamond. (Double-header.)" The Calendar doesn't
mention it, but the admission will be 50 cents. These
Stanford men are sly ones.
