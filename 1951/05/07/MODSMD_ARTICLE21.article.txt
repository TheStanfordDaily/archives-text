## Nielsen Answers Prof's Letter 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to Professor Philip Harsh's letter of Friday,
April 27, I should like to state the reasons for the AS
SU's eending to Europe for study only students who
are in the social sciences and active in extra-curricular
activities.
As a matter of precedent, the ASSU stipulated in
establishing the Foreign Scholarship Program in 1948
that it be restricted to foreign students in social sci
ences who were outstanding leaders.
It was hoped that in the years following their ex
perience at Stanford mixing and working with
American students and their extra-curricular activi
ties, these foreigners would rise in their own coun
tries to high positions in government, law, journal
ism, business, and education where they would be
able to use their understanding of America to create
a little more trust and friendship among the peoples
of the world.
Foreigners with well-developed personalities — the
ability to mix successfully with other people—who
have demonstrated outstanding leadership ability in
student affairs should be able to formulate and put into
action concrete programs aimed at creating trust and
friendship between nations.
Already, one of last year's ASSU foreign scholars,
Gottfried-Karl Kindermann from Vienna, is trying to
carry out this objective of our program. After spend
ing last summer at Lake Success as a UN intern, he is
buck in Vienna where he has organized the only insti
tute in Austria for the objective study of political
questions. This involves students from the four occu
pying nations as well as Austrian. 1 ;.
Th** practical effect of this project, which inci
dentally. employs the informal seminar method of
discussion Kindermann learned at the Hoover Insti
tute is widespread.
We feel that today the most critical need for under
standing and practical accomplishment exists is the
fields of social science. The foreign institutions offer
ing these scholarships to Stanfordites are anxious to
have students from whom they may obtain current
news on dangerous political economic, and .social
problems. They will look upon the meritants as am
ba;.sadoi> and have them participate in their local .stu
dent governments.
With the funds available to us to send Stanford stu
dents abroad, we feel the above need can be met to a
greater extent through students who are in the social
sciences and active in extra-curricular activities,
rather than through students in the fields of art and
classics.

To the Editor:
In reply to Professor Philip Harsh's letter of Friday,
April 27, I should like to state the reasons for the AS
SU's eending to Europe for study only students who
are in the social sciences and active in extra-curricular
activities.
As a matter of precedent, the ASSU stipulated in
establishing the Foreign Scholarship Program in 1948
that it be restricted to foreign students in social sci
ences who were outstanding leaders.
It was hoped that in the years following their ex
perience at Stanford mixing and working with
American students and their extra-curricular activi
ties, these foreigners would rise in their own coun
tries to high positions in government, law, journal
ism, business, and education where they would be
able to use their understanding of America to create
a little more trust and friendship among the peoples
of the world.
Foreigners with well-developed personalities — the
ability to mix successfully with other people—who
have demonstrated outstanding leadership ability in
student affairs should be able to formulate and put into
action concrete programs aimed at creating trust and
friendship between nations.
Already, one of last year's ASSU foreign scholars,
Gottfried-Karl Kindermann from Vienna, is trying to
carry out this objective of our program. After spend
ing last summer at Lake Success as a UN intern, he is
buck in Vienna where he has organized the only insti
tute in Austria for the objective study of political
questions. This involves students from the four occu
pying nations as well as Austrian. 1 ;.
Th** practical effect of this project, which inci
dentally. employs the informal seminar method of
discussion Kindermann learned at the Hoover Insti
tute is widespread.
