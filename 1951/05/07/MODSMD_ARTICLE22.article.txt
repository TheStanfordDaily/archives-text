# In MacArthur's Defense

To the Editor:
. . . There lias yet to appear in your paper any sup
port of Mac Arthur except in letters from your readers.
On the other hand, twice Bull Sessions have ridi
culed him and his supporters, apparently with your
editorial approbation.
In 1942 Mac Arthur was recalled, upon presidential

orders, to Australia from the hopeless battle of the
Philippines. At that time, little distance separated
him from the rolling juggernaut of Japanese con
quest.
In the Owen-Stanley Mountains of New Cuinea and
in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea he .stopped the drive
aimed at Australia. Then at the tail end of the supply
line and at the bottom of the priority list, with a catch
as catch can navy and air force, he started up the long
hard way back to the Philippines. ,The odds were
against his making it. As you must know, in 1944 j
Mac Arthur had returned to the Philippines after doing
some of the nastiest, hardest fighting of the war.
He didn't do it single-handed, but he was the leader
who made it possible.
The American people like to see a long-shot pay
oil; they like a man who keeps his word, and finally
they idoli/e anyone who overcomes vast obstacles to
succeed.
. . . His administration of Japan has been a model of
organizing a defeated power and leading it into the
ways of democracy. Finally, when the job in Korea !
was handed to him, he again overcame high obstacles |
to defeat a larger opponent.
The entry of Communist China into the conflict in no ;
v/ay alters this accomplshed fact, it made another war
irom which Mac Arthur was summarily returned. For
these reasons, entirely devoid of political aspects he
was accorded a hero's welcome when he returned
home, our greatest military commander living.
Mr. Cusick chooses to scorn these emotions. How
ever I find them genuine, and an expression of grati
tude from the heart of a people.
Mr. Grothe's Bull Session I found amusing, but his
appellation of "Dugout Doug'' is an insulting and un- i
earned nickname. Mac Arthurs' personal courage is
not to be questioned. . . .
