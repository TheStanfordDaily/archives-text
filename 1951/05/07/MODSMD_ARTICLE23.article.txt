# Check for the Crew
## 
### 
To the Editor:
. . . Your article in the April 17 Daily . . . has
scared me that maybe the Stanford crew can't compete
at Washington or Marietta, Ohio, unless more help is
forthcoming.
Please don't let that happen, for Stanford's partici
pation in the Nationals last year did morg for the
.schools' publicity than anything I have heard of in
my 10 years back in this crew-conscious country.
. . . Enclosed is a small check to help the cause in
a more material way. Lacking the information as to
how it should be made out, I have used your cam
paign slogan (Pull an Oar). . . .

to the "Stanford Crew Association" and sent to Box
ICIB, Stanford, Calif. If donors wish their contribu
tions to be tax-deductible, they should make checks
payable to Stanford University, with the notation
that the money be used for the crew. â€”The Editor.)
