# Farm Engineer Says Highways Need $3 Billion

California's highway system is not j
modern and is becoming more ob- ,
solete every day, in the opinion of ;
Clarkson H. Otflesby, associate pro- '
lessor of civil engineering at Stan- j
ford.
He estimated that to bring the i
state highway system up to modern !
standards would require an imme- |
diate investment of $3,000,000,000, j
with $1,400,000,000 needed if only
the network of strategically impor
tant defense roads is considered.
In a study of highway expendi
tures and sources of funds to finance
them, the Stanford engineer said
that deficiencies in the state high
way system are developing much
more rapidly than they are being
corrected.
In looking into the future pros
pects for California highways, Pro
fessor Oglesby estimated that if the
present rate of spending for state
highways is continued, some 25 or
more years must elapse before ex
isting deficiencies are remedied.
He emphasized that this estimate
is based on the assumption that no
new deficiencies will occur in the
meantime, that the number of mo
tor vehicles remains relatively con
stant, that the annual mileage per
vehicle will stay at the same level,
that the purchasing power of the
dollar stays put, and that highway
design standards remain fixed.
None of these assumptions can be
considered as valid, he explained,
pointing to numerous surveys and j
estimates, all of which point to in- I
creased population, more and more
motor vehicles, and increased an
nual mileage.
