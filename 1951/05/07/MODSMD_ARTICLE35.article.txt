# Foreign Students Need Pre-Reg Help
## 
### 
Seventy new foreign students will
arrive at Stanford next fallâ€”all in
need of help from the time they
arrive until they are registered,
their most difficult time on the
Farm.
Signups for help will be taken
Wednesday through Friday from 9
a.m. to 2 p.m. at a table outside the
Cellar. The work will involve writ
ing a short airmail letter to the
student of his choice and making
arrangements to meet him or her on
arrival at Stanford.
Students who cannot meet the
foreign scholars when they arrive
may assist them on Registration
Day. Further information is avail
able at the signup booth or from
Nancy Fihe, chairman of the host
and hostess committee, Branner, or
Willard Waterous, foreign student
adviser.
Both graduate and undergradu
ate students are invited to partici
pate.
