# Track Meet Records Fall
## 
### 
Saturday's frosh spikefest be
tween the Stanford and Cal year
lings, which the Cubs won 82 to 49,
will probably go down in history as
one of the most sensational college
freshman meets of all times.
Two of the winning times bet
tered the first-place marks of the
corresponding varsity races and
another tied its varsity counter
part.
Bearcub Guy Blackburn raced a
9.7 century to tie the ''Little Big
Meet" record. The varsity time was
9.9. The yearling mile, won by
Cal's Len Simpson in 4:23.9, was 3Va
seconds faster than John Woolley's
winning time in the ~IB ig Meet."
Cub Steve Turner set school and
meet records in both hurdle events
with clockings of 14.7 and 24.1. Not
only were the winning marks out
standing, but also most races were
characterized by great depth.
Far example, the first-place 880
time of 1:58.3 in Saturday's UC
LA -SC varsity meet wouldn't
have placed in the t'rosh half
where Papoose Dave Fletcher's
1:57.5 mark was only good for
third.
Cardbabe Jerry Wood ran a little
over 14.8 in the high barriers, but
it only netted him second. Another
Card, Doug Glenn, broad jumped
22 ft. 3 in. for third place, and ran
a 10.1 for second in the 100.
Other top performances by the
Papooses were Fred George's 49.4
quarter, Jim Mclndoe's double in
the pole vault and javelin, and Don
Carlson's 140-ft. 11 1 -in. throw in
the discus.
