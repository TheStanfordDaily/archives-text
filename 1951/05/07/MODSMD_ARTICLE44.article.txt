# CIBA Hopes Fading Away
## 
### 
The Stanford baseball team all
but bowed completely out of this
year's CIEA race by dropping a
tight 5 to 4 decision to California
Saturday afternoon at Berkeley.
The Indians will get their last
crack at loop-leading USC this af
ternoon when the two teams tangle
on the Sunken Diamond at 2:30.
The game was a pitchers' battle
between the Cards' Rog Osen
baugh and Cal's Bill Nishita with
Osenbaugh allowing only four
base hits, while his mates were
able to collect six off Nishita.
However, both pitchers were vic
tims of some loose fielding as both
teams collected three unearned
runs.
The Bears picked up single runs
in the third and fifth frames to
move ahead 2 to 0. The Cards got
to Nishita in the top of the eighth
as they pushed home four runs on
singles by Art Abrahamson, Tom
Shaw, Jim Walsh, and Osenbaugh,
a passed ball, and an error in the
Bear infield.
Tom Keough led off the Bear
half of the eighth by gaining life
on an error. A walk and two
singles later. Card mentor Everett
Dean was forced to send in Bob
Murphy to relieve Osenbaugh.
The Bears then capitalized on Ed
Milano's single and pinch-liitter
Carl Anaclerio's outfield fly for
two more runs and a 5 to 4 lead.
Cal relief hurler A 1 Mathews set
the Cards down in order in the top
of the ninth to practically erase the
Cards' hope of retaining the CIBA
pennant for another year.
