# ENCINA MEN ONLY

### HARRY GLAZE 
"Encina isn t quite so bad as we I
cx pec ted."
This seemed to be the consensus j
from the several hundred coeds and j
parents who inspected the hall when j
it lifted the iron curtain from 2 to 4 i
yesterday afternoon.
Dick Shooshan's band played, and ;
punch and cookies were served to I
the people who attended Encina's !
first open house in the 60-year ex- I
istcnce of the hall.
Encina's station KZFU, the bull- j
pen broadcasting company, present- J
cd "Workers Arise, You Bums!"
"Hie ROTC Hour." and other fea-;
tures to entertain anyone who {
might have been out in the back !
court.
A smudge pot and two crossed red i
flags heralded the occasion on one
floor, and a >.arter . nakc was sam
pling thr punch in the lounge. The
only near mishap was that a water
bag just missed a group of coeds
arriving in a convertible. When
Resident Director Mrs, Ellene Sum
ner went out to investigate all she J
saw was a coed leaning on a fifth- i
floor window sill.
Most of the girls agreed that En- !
cina is "different from Roblc." One
even thought it was nicer than
Branner. Alter searching for dust J
on desks and floors, girls and par- j
ents alike were surprised to find the !
place so clean.
Various comments arose concern- j
ing decorations on the walls. "Some |
of the rooms look so bare; but oth- !
ers .. . ." "Those arc some of the
most revealing pictures I've seen."
"No wonder you can't get to sleep
early around here," remarked one
parent. Many were surprised to see j
how much space there is in the j
rooms and halls.
After the crowd had left, Mrs. I

Sumner was satisfied that the affair
had been a success.
Richard L. Balch, chief counselor
for men, suggested making an an
nual affair of the open house, say
ing, "ft gives the girls a chance to
see what Encina is like. They've
heard a lot about it, but now they
can really find out."
