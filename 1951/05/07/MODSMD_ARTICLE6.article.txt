California's middle-distance aco'

scene Saturday as the Indian varsity i
spike squad downed the Bears, 74 |
to 57, in the 56th renewal of the Big
Meet.
In the frosh contest, held on Cal's j
Edwards Field along with the varsity i

1:56 880 triumph. Still later the
sophomore wonder returned in the !
relay to make up four yards on In
dian anchor man Bill Storum and

ing performances were recorded by
Hob Math ins. Boh Bryan. Boh Si
mon. and Maurice Parsons.

Mathias in the lows. The decathlon
champ's marks is just six tenths off !
the best collegiate time in the nation.
Simon, running the third two
mile of his life, outsmarted his Bear
opponent who had run about eight
seconds faster than he earlier this

sliced about six seconds off his pre
vious best.
Parsons won a century vie- [
tory in photo finish that saw the first
three men separated by less than nine
inches. Bear Jim Plessas nipped Wil
bur Taylor by six inches for second, j
Taylor lost another hairbreadth]
decision to Plessas in the furlong, this
time by three inches. Parsons was I
four yards back.

were meet captain Mcrrlt Van Sant,
who won the broad jump at 23 ft.
H in.: Norm Jiles who copped the high
jump at 6 ft. ?, in., to lead the In
dians to a sweep of that event; and j
Wally McCamant, who ran a 1:57 half
in taking second to Hutchinson.
Jiles suffered a sprained ankle on
his final leap, but trainer Connie
Jarvis said the injury wasn't too
serious.
