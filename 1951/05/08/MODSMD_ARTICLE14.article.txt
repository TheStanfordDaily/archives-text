# ‘Who's Blue?’ Funny Birds Insured: $100
## 
### 
Who's the most valuable mem
ber of the Spring Show cast?
If life insurance policies arc
any indication, then the two par
rots in "Who's Blue?" deserve top
billing over their human co-stars.
Gabriel and his feminine friend,
played by birds borrowed from a
Menlo Park pet shop, are being
insured hv the ASSU for a cool
$100 each during their run here.
So far, no one has taken anv such
precautions for the mere humans
in the show.
The humans—Betty Benson, Don
Campbell. Sue Alter, and George
Denny—with the rest of the cast
and chorus will appear at their
own risk in Memorial Auditorium
on May 17, 18, and 19.
Tickets for all three nights of
"Who's Blue?" are on sale this
week at Engineering corner from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and at the Mem
And box office (DA 3-0665) from
9 a.m. lo p.m. Seats arc 60 cents,
90 ccnts, and $1.20.
