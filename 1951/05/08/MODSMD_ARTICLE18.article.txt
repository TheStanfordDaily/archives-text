# Allies Push Reds North Of the 38th
## 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, May 8 (UP)
—A new Allied limited offen
sive struck savagely across the
100-mile Korean battlefront Mon
day to wipe out the enemy's
foothold in South Korea before
he can mount the second phase
of his spring campaign.
New type Communist jet planes
struck near the front for the second
consecutive day and there were
mounting indications the enemy of
fensive may roll southward within
48 hours — possibly under cover of
major air attacks.
On the cast coast, Allied forces
advanced against moderate to stub
born enemy resistance to put their
northernmost units at Kangson,
nine miles above the .''Bth parallel.
ROK forces in this area had been
withdrawing since the Red offensive
opened more than two weeks ago,
but they never fell back below the
border.
The heaviest United Nations at
tacks came northwest of Scoid and
in the Inje sector at the east end of
the line where South Koreans
reached the 38th parallel. But in
the central section, where the en
emy's original breakthrough oc
curred, a strong armored task forcc
rammed into the town of Chunchon
without opposition and pushed
north a mile to within seven miles
of the border.
Allied planes ranging a few miles
ahead found a big enemy buildup.
Northwest of Seoul, South Ko
reans backed by American artillery
and aircraft tore into Red-held po
sitions menacing the capital, break
ing the week-long lull on the bat
tlefront. They hoped to drive the
enemy back across the Imjin River
and enable the Allied line to move
up and erase a deep enemy wedge.
At the eastern end of the front,
South Koreans who sent patrols
across the 38th parallel Sunday at
tacked toward Inje and reached the
border four miles below the city
without major opposition. A pa
trol just to the west ran into a
mine-field and received small-arms
fire but withdrew safely.
The tough South Korean infantry
men hacked their way three miles
through stubbornly resisting rem
nants of the battered First North
Korean Army Corps, meeting
groups up to regiment size. The
rnd of a day of bitter fighting found
the determined ROKs 10 to 13
miles above Seoul.

consecutive day and there were
mounting indications the enemy of
fensive may roll southward within
48 hours — possibly under cover of
major air attacks.
On the cast coast, Allied forces
advanced against moderate to stub
born enemy resistance to put their
northernmost units at Kangson,
nine miles above the .''Bth parallel.
ROK forces in this area had been
withdrawing since the Red offensive
opened more than two weeks ago,
but they never fell back below the
border.
The heaviest United Nations at
tacks came northwest of Scoid and
in the Inje sector at the east end of
the line where South Koreans
reached the 38th parallel. But in
the central section, where the en
emy's original breakthrough oc
curred, a strong armored task forcc
rammed into the town of Chunchon
without opposition and pushed
north a mile to within seven miles
of the border.
Allied planes ranging a few miles
ahead found a big enemy buildup.
Northwest of Seoul, South Ko
reans backed by American artillery
and aircraft tore into Red-held po
sitions menacing the capital, break
ing the week-long lull on the bat
tlefront. They hoped to drive the
enemy back across the Imjin River
and enable the Allied line to move
up and erase a deep enemy wedge.
At the eastern end of the front,
South Koreans who sent patrols
across the 38th parallel Sunday at
tacked toward Inje and reached the
border four miles below the city
without major opposition. A pa
trol just to the west ran into a
mine-field and received small-arms
fire but withdrew safely.
The tough South Korean infantry
men hacked their way three miles
through stubbornly resisting rem
nants of the battered First North
Korean Army Corps, meeting
groups up to regiment size. The
rnd of a day of bitter fighting found
the determined ROKs 10 to 13
miles above Seoul.
