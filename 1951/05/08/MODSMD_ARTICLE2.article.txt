### 
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y. â€” The
United States formally introduced
a resolution at the United Nations
today calling for a 100 per cent arms
embargo against Communist China.
Britain and Franco fell in line
with the American plan, whose aim
is to ensure that "no soldier in
Korea should be the target of a
bullet manufactured in the free
world."
