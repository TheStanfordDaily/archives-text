# Costs and the Con Home
## 
### 
Once again, Con Home Week.
Once again, Stanford students will raise
some five to six thousand dollars to help sup
port 72 sick kids from underprivileged homes
in the Bay Area.
Last year the grand student total was $5,750 —
enough to defray a year's expenses for three
tots at the rate of $5 per day per tot.
This year, as we know only too well, costs
are up. Con Home accountants figure about $8
per day instead of an outdated $5. All of which
means we'll have a tough time supporting two
kids instead of three.
Still, sickness knows no parallel to the price
level. The home still has more applicants than
it knOws what to do with; still has to turn down
altogether too many who need its help.
Con Home Week is old stuff at Stanford. In

one form or another, Stanfordites have been
helping out the kids for 31 years. Of course
in the old days there was a lot more "labor"
attached to Con Home Week than there is now.
Today, with the home a long - established
charity, we find lawns, individual one - story
buildings, and a real playground there. In the
days of "Padre" Gardner (who founded the
home in 1920), there were no yards, no unit-'
wards, no greensward surrounding a cluster of
tile-roofed buildings. In those days, the "la
borer's" job was never finished.
This next year, at least in a financial way,
the home needs us worse than ever. The play
grounds' there—but the cost of maintaining it
has jumped sky-high.
If it's anyone's job to support the STANFORD
Convalescent Home, it's ours!
