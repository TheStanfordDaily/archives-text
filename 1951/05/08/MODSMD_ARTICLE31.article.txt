# BULL SESSION
## 
### BEV BOCK 
Outsiders around the Farm this week probably
think we're harboring a bunch of criminals or some
thing. Con Home. Labor Day. Sounds like good mate
i i;il fbi* a book—maybe one of the boys sent over irom
campus to do "forced labor" could write one titled
'My 20 Hours in Con-Con," or "Why Did I Throw
that Waterbag, Anyway?"
But chuckle as you will, there's still an element Ol
mystery about the Con Home. Maybe, like me, you're
a junior who's been confronted with rain every Labor
Day. Unless you've had the dubious honor of working
a few hours for the Con Home, you've probably never
even been there.
The other day I went over to the Home to get a
story. Here's what I found out:
First of all, the kids don't wear striped prison suits
v/iih long numbers on them. As a matter of fact, red
and. white are the predominant colors, and even the
nurses wear red capes instead of the usual blue ones
with their uniforms.
Second, there are no bars on the windows. The bed
patients have to stay in their beds, but there is a large
group of children—"runabouts" they're called —who
are allowed to dash about and get in the nurses' hair.

They've got a big playground with slides and teeter
totters and swings and sandbox and treehouse and
live-sized playhouse and lots of room to play in.
And, best of all. I learned that the kids really look
forward to having Stanford students come over to
work on Labor Day. Some of them consider us their
big brothers and sisters, and you've no idea how much
they appreciate anything and everything that's done
for them.
There are some mighty cute kids over there, and
it did my heart good to see their happy faces and
the many things that are done to keep them that
way. They need to be kept busy, to have good nour
ishment, and to play in the sunshine. Because of
the help given them they can have these things.
So, in hopes that the mystery about Con Home will
be cleared up, I'm saying a couple of prayers—
First, may the Good Lord bring sunshine for
Labor Day.
Second, may you all go work at the Con Ilotne to
morrow. The sunshine will do your fates good, the
work will do your muscles good, and the kids' faces
will do your heart good.
Try it, and see for yourself.

'My 20 Hours in Con-Con," or "Why Did I Throw
that Waterbag, Anyway?"
But chuckle as you will, there's still an element Ol
mystery about the Con Home. Maybe, like me, you're
a junior who's been confronted with rain every Labor
Day. Unless you've had the dubious honor of working
a few hours for the Con Home, you've probably never
even been there.
The other day I went over to the Home to get a
story. Here's what I found out:
First of all, the kids don't wear striped prison suits
v/iih long numbers on them. As a matter of fact, red
and. white are the predominant colors, and even the
nurses wear red capes instead of the usual blue ones
with their uniforms.
Second, there are no bars on the windows. The bed
patients have to stay in their beds, but there is a large
group of children—"runabouts" they're called —who
are allowed to dash about and get in the nurses' hair.

They've got a big playground with slides and teeter
totters and swings and sandbox and treehouse and
live-sized playhouse and lots of room to play in.
And, best of all. I learned that the kids really look
forward to having Stanford students come over to
work on Labor Day. Some of them consider us their
big brothers and sisters, and you've no idea how much
they appreciate anything and everything that's done
for them.
There are some mighty cute kids over there, and
it did my heart good to see their happy faces and
the many things that are done to keep them that
way. They need to be kept busy, to have good nour
ishment, and to play in the sunshine. Because of
the help given them they can have these things.
So, in hopes that the mystery about Con Home will
be cleared up, I'm saying a couple of prayers—
First, may the Good Lord bring sunshine for
Labor Day.
Second, may you all go work at the Con Ilotne to
morrow. The sunshine will do your fates good, the
work will do your muscles good, and the kids' faces
will do your heart good.
Try it, and see for yourself.
Outsiders around the Farm this week probably
think we're harboring a bunch of criminals or some
thing. Con Home. Labor Day. Sounds like good mate
i i;il fbi* a book—maybe one of the boys sent over irom
campus to do "forced labor" could write one titled
'My 20 Hours in Con-Con," or "Why Did I Throw
that Waterbag, Anyway?"
