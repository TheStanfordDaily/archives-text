## ‘The Thing’ Disappointing 
### ROY HEMMING GEORGE BUCKLEY 
"The Thing" has come to Palo Alto. A French wench
named Manon may have been kept out of town, but
a carnivorous, thinking vegetable from Mars has taken
up temporary residence at the Stanford Theater. The
implication is that films which get too earthy are dan
gerous~for us humans, but "things" from other worlds
are good, clean entertainment.
As a science-fiction movie, "The Thing" is a dis
appointment. Our betters in the science departments
will undoubtedly find lots of holes in the picture.
But even as pure hokum it suffers from a failure to
use very much imagination in developing its story.
We won't spoil anything for those of you who intend
to see it for yourselves by describing The Thing. But
we can say that it's a creature from Mars who arrives
via a Hying saucer, and then reveals that on his planet
the vegetables have all the brains and the animals
(like us) provide their food.
Most of the picture is then concerned with the at
tempts of some people at an Arctic outpost to avoid
being The Thing's next supper entree.
There's a scientist who has little regard for hu
man values and who forms a weird sort of fifth
column to let The Thing have its way.
But producer Howard Hawks ("Air Force," "Only
Angels Have Wings") sees to it that the Army Air
Corps has the final say—although the finale is not
much different from the fate that Hollywood has pre
viously bestowed on its famous "Frankenstein."

Such a lack of imagination seems even more disap
pointing since last year's "Destination Moon" showed
that worthwhile science-fiction movies could be made.
"Destination Moon" was almost a documentary of
what is presently known about getting to the moon;
it was believable and realistic—whereas "The Thing"
seems purely contrived.
According to reports, Hollywood is preparing lots
more science-fiction movies. We hope they're mod
eled after "Destination Moon" and not "The Thing"
—for as such they can serve an important function
in developing a better awareness among the public of
the scientific and dynamic nature of our times.
Such films can also—quite seriously—stimulate a
healthy, realistic interest in the nature of man and
our universe. Furthermore, they can be loads of fun.
Howard Hawks' "The Thing" accomplishes little,
however, even as sensational, bizarre entertainment.
At some points the thin idea is so dragged-out that
two or thiee characters are speaking at the same time
—and it doesn't make much difference which one you
try to listen to.
What bothers us even more is the fact that the
writers left the door open for a sequel by not telling
what happens at the end to soine offsprings of The
Thing allegedly left in the greenhouse—which, in
terestingly, were reproduced "without pain or
pleasure."
Maybe that's why Palo Alto will let us see "The
Thing" but not "Manon."
