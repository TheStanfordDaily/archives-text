KZSU is putting the spotlight on
the "Stanford Sports Review" to
night at 7:45. Emcee Bob Ryan is
going to spend 15 minutes talking
over all sorts of interesting things
with baseballers Roger Osenbaugh,
Bob Murphy, and Dave Rosen
crantz.
Also KZSU informs all loyal lis
teners that they should not turn oft
their radios at 11 tonight and go to
bed. Instead they should stay up
(with radios tuned to KZSU, of
course) and hear 15 minutes of the
latest, red-hot news. This 11-o'clock
news is a new thing with KZSU
since yesterday.
