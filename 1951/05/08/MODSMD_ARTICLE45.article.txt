# SC Slugs Card Nine, CIBA Hopes 10 to 2
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
USC's invading baseball team completely eliminated Stanford
from any chance to retain its CIBA crown by dumping the Indian j
nine, 10 to 2, on the Sunken Diamond yesterday afternoon. The
Trojans looked like a different ball club than the one that the Cards
took, 6 to 1, here several weeks ago as they hit the ball hard and

often yesterday.
Troy Didn't Waste Time
The men of Troy opened their at
tack on Stanfords' starting hurler Joe
Chez in the first inning. Lead off man
Tom Kiach was nicked by one of
Chez' pitches, and Stan Charnofsky,
Hob Liilis, and A 1 Karan followed
with consecutive singles to score two
runs. The Trojans tallied once more j
as Hal Charnofsky Hied deep to left
field, Karan tagging up to come home
after the catch.
Tom Lovrich, who opened on the j
mound for Southern California, had
control trouble in the first inning as j
lie hit Bruce Cameron and walked !
Art Abrahamson. Dick Clegg ■
grounded out, moving Cameron to '
third and Abrahamson to second. |
Jack Shepard singled into left field to i
send Cameron across with the Cards' J
first run. However, Lovrich bore
down to strike out Tom Shaw and !
Chuck Essegian to end the inning.
Trojans Explode in Fifth
The fireworks started again in the
fifth as Kiach led off with a double
and Stan Charnofsky walked. Card
coach Everett Dean lifted Chez in fa
vor of Bob Murphy. However, the !
Trojans picked up a walk and three !
more base hits off Murphy to cash in

! for five more runs and a comfortable,
9 to 2, margin.
The -Trojans rounded out their J
j scoring for the day with one run in j
the seventh on a walk, a stolen base, j
and Gary Killingsworth's single into I
left center field.
Dick Clegg led off the Stanford
eighth with a double down the third ;
baseline, took third on Dick Cole's
line single into center, and scored the
i final run of the day as Dave Rosen
| krantz forced Cole at second.
