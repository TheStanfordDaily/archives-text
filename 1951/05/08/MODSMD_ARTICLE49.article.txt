Another Big Meet victory is in the books. There is no better time than
now to review the track situation at Stanford.
Stanford ranks high in the track world, not at the top, but right up there
with the perennial best, USC. We regard the Trojans as the Notre Dame
of track. Their ability to attract the finest prep runners by hook or crook
is accepted and not up for present discussion.
Although it is true that the Stanford frosh don't often lose, their compe
tition is not the best. They have never run against the USC freshmen, and
therefore no definite conclusions can be drawn, but comparative times be
tween the two squads in the past years have shown the Trobabes superior,
and subsequent varsity performances are not out of line.
USC Is the Tops in Track
USC is the best and there is no getting around it. Giving SC top dog
position, Stanford is usually next on top of the pack, both nationally and
locally.
The records prove this:
1. In the NCAA meets, matching the nation's top schools, which have
heen entered 25 times by the PCC, Stanford has finished first three times,
and second six times. The Indians have taken third, fourth, or fifth place
honors on five other occasions.
2. In 5G runnings of the Big Meet, Stanford has won 29. while two have
ended deadlocked.
3. Stanford has won the Fresno Relays twice, and once tied with USC. The
Trojans have won 19 of the Fresno extravaganzas.
4. In 18 runnings of the PCC meet, which all conference schools enter,
Stanford has three wins, which are as many or more than other competitors
with the exception of the SCers.
5. In local dual, three-way meets, etc., Stanford has always shown power
and collectively, over the years, holds a majority of wins.
It should be remembered that during the war years Stanford was
inactive, although many of the above events were still run.
Recent Improvement, Success, and Recognition
Under the coaching of Jack Weiershauser, who assumed his duties in 194(5.
the Stanford track situation has shown definite improvement. The return
to national recognition, following the war layoff, has been gradual.
In 1949 the Indians beat California and finished third in the NCAA.
Last year the Cards trounced the Bears, 80 to 51, regained national ac
claim by finishing second in the NCAA, and then did the near-impossible
by upsetting USC at the Modesto Relays, marking the first Stanford win
of any nature over USC since before the war. Previously the Indians had
been nosed out at Fresno by a referee's reversal of decision which gave
USC enough points to take the Relays while Stanford obliged a accept
second spot. The year marked a return to prewar success and national
recognition.
Hampered by injuries in '51 the Indians have dropped a few but showed
surprising strength in totaling more points against the Trojans than in '50
and trouncing the Bears. The Cards are approaching full strength and poten
tial and will surprise many in the close-at-hand Fresno and Modesto Re
lays. Weiershauser said yesterday that "we can still take second in the
nationals,"
If this has appeared to be a defense for the Stanford track team or
coach, review the above statistics, and you should agree that no defense
is needed. A good record speaks for itself.
AFTERTHOUGHT: The closest and at the same time oddest Big Meet oc
curred in 1913. The 220 race was so nip and tuck that the judges decided
to re-run the race following the remaining events. Stanford sprinter Camp
bell won the event, giving the Indians the meet, G1 1-5 to GO 4-5.

of track. Their ability to attract the finest prep runners by hook or crook
is accepted and not up for present discussion.
Although it is true that the Stanford frosh don't often lose, their compe
tition is not the best. They have never run against the USC freshmen, and
therefore no definite conclusions can be drawn, but comparative times be
tween the two squads in the past years have shown the Trobabes superior,
and subsequent varsity performances are not out of line.
USC Is the Tops in Track
USC is the best and there is no getting around it. Giving SC top dog
position, Stanford is usually next on top of the pack, both nationally and
locally.
The records prove this:
1. In the NCAA meets, matching the nation's top schools, which have
heen entered 25 times by the PCC, Stanford has finished first three times,
and second six times. The Indians have taken third, fourth, or fifth place
honors on five other occasions.
2. In 5G runnings of the Big Meet, Stanford has won 29. while two have
ended deadlocked.
3. Stanford has won the Fresno Relays twice, and once tied with USC. The
Trojans have won 19 of the Fresno extravaganzas.
4. In 18 runnings of the PCC meet, which all conference schools enter,
Stanford has three wins, which are as many or more than other competitors
with the exception of the SCers.
5. In local dual, three-way meets, etc., Stanford has always shown power
and collectively, over the years, holds a majority of wins.
It should be remembered that during the war years Stanford was
inactive, although many of the above events were still run.
Recent Improvement, Success, and Recognition
Under the coaching of Jack Weiershauser, who assumed his duties in 194(5.
the Stanford track situation has shown definite improvement. The return
to national recognition, following the war layoff, has been gradual.
In 1949 the Indians beat California and finished third in the NCAA.
Last year the Cards trounced the Bears, 80 to 51, regained national ac
claim by finishing second in the NCAA, and then did the near-impossible
by upsetting USC at the Modesto Relays, marking the first Stanford win
of any nature over USC since before the war. Previously the Indians had
been nosed out at Fresno by a referee's reversal of decision which gave
USC enough points to take the Relays while Stanford obliged a accept
second spot. The year marked a return to prewar success and national
recognition.
Hampered by injuries in '51 the Indians have dropped a few but showed
surprising strength in totaling more points against the Trojans than in '50
and trouncing the Bears. The Cards are approaching full strength and poten
tial and will surprise many in the close-at-hand Fresno and Modesto Re
lays. Weiershauser said yesterday that "we can still take second in the
nationals,"
If this has appeared to be a defense for the Stanford track team or
coach, review the above statistics, and you should agree that no defense
is needed. A good record speaks for itself.
AFTERTHOUGHT: The closest and at the same time oddest Big Meet oc
curred in 1913. The 220 race was so nip and tuck that the judges decided
to re-run the race following the remaining events. Stanford sprinter Camp
bell won the event, giving the Indians the meet, G1 1-5 to GO 4-5.


Another Big Meet victory is in the books. There is no better time than
now to review the track situation at Stanford.
Stanford ranks high in the track world, not at the top, but right up there
with the perennial best, USC. We regard the Trojans as the Notre Dame
of track. Their ability to attract the finest prep runners by hook or crook
is accepted and not up for present discussion.
