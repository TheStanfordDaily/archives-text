# Crew Preps For Seattle
## 
### 
With their big three - way race j
with Cal and Washington only four j
days away, the Stanford rowers
hustled through final workouts
Coach Jim Beggs will take both the
varsity shell and a frosh eight to
the Seattle regatta.
The varsity will fly north early j
Wednesday morning, and the Pa
pooses, who are financing their own
trip, will go by way of the Cascade, j
A Seattle hotel-owner has made ar- j
rangements to house the crew in
the New Washington Hotel. The
races will be held Saturday' after
noon.
Beggs has been working the first
boat overtime, trying to get the
shell set. Out for the entire season
are Bill Meyer and Don Craven,
veteran oarsmen. Meyer developed j
a blood condition, and Craven is j
still weak from a long siege of I
pneumonia.
To add to Beggs' problems, stroke i
Dewey Heeht has had the miseries |
for two weeks in a row. He will not
make, the trip north. Sam Stearns |
has been working the stroke posi
tion, and captain Jim Fifer had a
try at the important post yesterday
morning.
