## Hill Finds Witness; Sight May Be Lost in One Eye 
### 
The "student who needed a wit
ness," Richard Hill, 25-year-old so
ciology graduate, found one late
Monday afternoon. His name is
William Weilcr. a student in the
I Graduate School of Business.
Wcilcr was driving a blue Chev
rolet and was one-half block abcad
j of Hill's jeepster when the latter
1 banged into a pickup truck driven
j by Alfred Kirouac of Palo Alto at
tbe corner of El Camino Real and
Roble Avenue last Thursday morn
ing.
j As a result of the accident, Palo
Alto Hospital doctors fear Hill will
j be blinded in one eye. Dr. Owen
Tanner, attending physician, said
| last night he "didn't expect recov
ery of Hill's vision," but wouldn't
i know for sure "for several weeks."
In a statement to Menlo Park po
lice last Monday night, Weilcr said
i he passed Hill in the middle lane
just north of the Roble-El Camino
intersection.
Seconds later he said he heard
a crash, and "glanced in my rear

view mirror . . . just in time to see
Hill's hood fly in air . . ."
After the accident, Hill's jeepster
"appeared to be in the middle
lan"," Weilcr stated. Weilcr previ
ously indicated that Hill had been
driving in the inside lane before
the accident, thus corroborating po
lice reconstruction of the mishap
(that Hill had swerved to his right
in an attempt to miss Kirouac).
Weilcr said he drove on after
ward "since the collision did not
seem to be serious." He said be had
an appointment to make on campus.
Roth Weilcr and Hill live in the
Village and left there about the
same time Thursday morning to go
to campus.
Originally, no witnesses had re
ported seeing the Hill-Kirouac ac
cident except Kirouac. Hill was im
mediately knocked unconscious.
To find out "whether my husband
was really at fault or not," Hill's
wife sent out a call for the "driver
of the blue Chevy" in Monday's
Daily.
