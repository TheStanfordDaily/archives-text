# Independent Study Plan Discussed by Commission
## 
### 
A more extensive independent-study program, a course-evalua
tion system, and the senior conferences came up for discussion
at Monday night's meeting of the Student-Faculty Education Com
mission.
The matter of independent study was broached by a letter from

six Roble women who disliked the
competitive aspects of the present
study system with its "cramming" for
tests and also disapproved of the
large classes in lecture courses.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
higlcr commented that the Lower Di
vision Committee, which is currently
considering a tcvised LD curriculum,
will probably develop some inde
pendent study plan on a long-range
basis.
LI) Requirements
Winbigler said that the Lower Di
vision Committee feels there should
he more than one way to meet the
LD requirements, and the idea is that
students should be free to do inde
pendent work without even register
ing for classes. In any case, students
would still be required to pass final
examinations.
"Rut some members of-the Lower
Division Committee wonder if stu
dents would take them up on it,"the
Dean stated. "We feel 08 per cent of
the students would take the course
route because it is the most direct."
Suit-Committee
Bud McCord, retiring chairman of
the commission, asked the five stu
dents and five faculty members to
i present their opinion on establishing
i.i sub-committee to work with the
Lower Division Committee on the
| matter.
Such a committee, according to
McCord. would investigate the actual
] desire of students for an independent
study honors program, the popularity
5 of such programs already in opera
tion. and the possibility of extending
(lir program to the Upper Division.
The commission decided to post
pone setting up a sub-committee at
| least until a l etter indication of stu
dent interest was available. McCord
i then requested that interested stu
dents send their ideas to him at 1142
j Byron Street, Palo Alto.
Recent appointees to the commis
sion are Dr. Helen Farnsworth of the
Food Research Institute, Brad Blaine,
I president of the junior class, and
j Dean Winbigler.

course-evaluation system and on
the current senior conferences will
be described in tomorrow's Daily.)

A more extensive independent-study program, a course-evalua
tion system, and the senior conferences came up for discussion
at Monday night's meeting of the Student-Faculty Education Com
mission.
The matter of independent study was broached by a letter from

six Roble women who disliked the
competitive aspects of the present
study system with its "cramming" for
tests and also disapproved of the
large classes in lecture courses.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
higlcr commented that the Lower Di
vision Committee, which is currently
considering a tcvised LD curriculum,
will probably develop some inde
pendent study plan on a long-range
basis.
LI) Requirements
Winbigler said that the Lower Di
vision Committee feels there should
he more than one way to meet the
LD requirements, and the idea is that
students should be free to do inde
pendent work without even register
ing for classes. In any case, students
would still be required to pass final
examinations.
"Rut some members of-the Lower
Division Committee wonder if stu
dents would take them up on it,"the
Dean stated. "We feel 08 per cent of
the students would take the course
route because it is the most direct."
Suit-Committee
Bud McCord, retiring chairman of
the commission, asked the five stu
dents and five faculty members to
i present their opinion on establishing
i.i sub-committee to work with the
Lower Division Committee on the
| matter.
Such a committee, according to
McCord. would investigate the actual
] desire of students for an independent
study honors program, the popularity
5 of such programs already in opera
tion. and the possibility of extending
(lir program to the Upper Division.
The commission decided to post
pone setting up a sub-committee at
| least until a l etter indication of stu
dent interest was available. McCord
i then requested that interested stu
dents send their ideas to him at 1142
j Byron Street, Palo Alto.
Recent appointees to the commis
sion are Dr. Helen Farnsworth of the
Food Research Institute, Brad Blaine,
I president of the junior class, and
j Dean Winbigler.
(The commission's action on a
course-evaluation system and on
the current senior conferences will
be described in tomorrow's Daily.)
