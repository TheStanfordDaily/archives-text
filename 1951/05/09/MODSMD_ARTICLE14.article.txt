# TUESDAY SERIES
## Dancers' Program Colorful 
### 
Performing before a large
Tuesday Evening audience, the
Stanford Hoedowners last night j
presented a varied and colorful
program of English, Nordic, j
Slavic, and American folk and j
square dances.
The first section of the program,
which was devoted to dances from
the British Isles, ranged in spirit
from the sedate Hundson House,
derived from old court forms, to the
humorous Old Men's Jig, a Morris
dance derived from elaborate reli
gious ceremonies and performed on
special occasions such as fair days.
These English dances have been
handed down to us from medieval
times and represent the purest of
all the forms of folk dances.
Nordic Group
The Nordic group included the
| lively Firetur, a Danish dance for
j four people; the Oxdansen, an ini
tiation "hazing" dance from Swe
den; the German Puttjenter; and
the Schuhplattler, a shoe-clapping
couple dance from the Austrian
Tyrol.
The Oxdansen, performed by Al-
I lan Wilmunder and Bill Grishaw,
j drew chuckles from the audience
as the dancers engaged in a mock
fight, re-enacting the movements of
treading on each other's toes, pull
ing hair, and boxing cars.
Croation Dimes
In the Slavic group, the Croatian
JDi mes, a "shake" dance for two
women and one man, in many ways
! resembled American jitterbugging.
I II is popularly supposed that if a
J woman can dance the Dimes well,
I she will make a good farm wife.
The pattern has remained con
stant through hundreds of years
with only a few slight variations. It
is danced only on special holiday
occasions.
