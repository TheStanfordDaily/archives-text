# How to Coach a Football Team
## 
### 
EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO RUN A
FOOTBALL TEAM, SO LET'S LEAVE 'EM GO
AHEAD AND DO IT!
That's Head Football Coach Chuck Taylor's
philosophy, and it seems to be working out fine.
For the past 10 days, Taylor and his staff have
lunched wiih 10 fraternities. Before they're
through, the six mentors plan to get together
v/ith the remaining 14.
Why? It's all part of a far-reaching public re
lations program designed to acquaint every
Stanford man with the athletic picture on cam
pus.
Mote than that, Coach Taylor's brainstorm
is intended to INCLUDE as many Stanford
men as possible in the job cI building top
athletic teams.
Am might be expected, the idea is meeting
with huge success.
When lunch is over, each coach takes his
turn at the rostrum. When Taylor can't make a
luncheon date, Frosh-]V Coach Bob Ghilotti
takes over and talks about the importance of
attracting outstanding athletes to Stanford (he's
Taylor's chief contact man).
Ghilotti gets right down to cases. He asks
each fraternity if it wouldn't be willing to host
on© or two high school or junior college pros
pects over a weekend, with the purpose of
showing them around campus, taking them to
a campus social function, and just plain "mak
ing friends" with them.
So tar. most ol the houses are moie than
willing to get in the act.
i Then Ghilotti carries the ball some more. He
1
asks each and every member of the house to

take a personal look-see into his own hometown
athletic scene. Spotting top-notch high school
athletes and sending their names to the Athletic
Department can be and is one of the most effec
tive ways of introducing prep school seniors
to Stanford.
This idea too has met gratifying response.
After Ghilotti is finished, the other coaches
take over. After a few brief remarks, the ses
sions usually take on the character of a question
and answer period, fraternity men asking those
impossible questions about "who's going to
win next fall," and the coaches doing some very
clever sidestepping.
In all, the luncheon dates are a lot of fun. But
they're also getting something done in the way
of "far-reaching" results.
In the first place, the sessions are very likely
to provide Stanford with better athletes. Those
we do get will still have to pass our academic
requirements — avowedly stiff but the field
from which they're chosen is going to be wider
and greener.
Secondly, as a result of the get acquainted
program, we're going to better UNDERSTAND
what goes on behind the scenes in football at
Stanford.
for instance, as Line Coach foe Huelz put
it the other day, "How are you going to teach
a team how to block and tackle when the
men who need the coaching most are only
out for practice 45 minutes a day?"
It's a very real problem, and it's only one of
the many that all of us would do better to know
a little more about.
Hats off to Chuck Taylor for helping to ex
plain just what some of those problems are.
