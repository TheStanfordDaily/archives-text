# BULL SESSION

### DICK KLEIN 
Iley, guys! Have you been down to the Bookstore
and gotten your copy of that book? You know, the
book that will help you pass the Selective Service
College Qualification Test. Those writers back in New
York have the full scoop on that Princeton Testing
Center that dreamed up this exam.
But all kidding aside, Stanford Roughs must be
advised about these aptitude-testing devices. Surely
you must know, or have met, one of those haggard-
Rooking characters wandering around campus who
took the Legal Aptitude Test a couple of weekends
ago. Well, those guys haven't recovered yet. And
their test was brewed up by the same Princeton
outfit.
Just ask 'em what they think about the 11th Fed
eralist paper, or the export-import figures for the
United States in 1753. or the get-one-of-the-under
stored - words - out-of - this -paragraph - to - improve -
tjie-meaning type questions. Of course, the future
lawyers' exam was a six-hour ordeal. The Feds are
Ijeing easy on us, and cut the sentence down to a mere
three hours.
The test itself really isn't too hard. Why the Stan
ford Testing Service, with the advice and consultation
of the Psychology Department, predicts that at least
somebody on campus will score high enough to quali
ty for a deferment. Of course, they are not positive
about this prediction, as their sampling effectiveness
was only 30 per cent which will allow for great error.
But, on to the test. I've overheard some RO profs
talking. They claim that it was so darned complicated
lo apply for the test, send letters and proper forms to
the local draft boards, and meet all the regulations to
£t-t an admission card to SS Aptitude, that those who
just, manage to be handed the test sheet should be al
lowed to continue their higher education.
Why, I heard of one guy who got so loused up
in trying to take the exam this May 20 that his draft
board in Watsonville thought he was trying for OCS.
Anyhow, he's now at Fort Benning, (ia. And that's
not a peachie situation, no matter how you look at it.
Kven if the boys back at Princeton get the picture

that you are applying for the Aptitude Test, they are
bound to foul you up by giving you the wrong date
at the wrong center. Or vice-versa. It can be hard as
heck on those sunmmer vacation plans.
But let's get back to the test itself. Not to go into
competition with the good men who wrote the learned
book, but I feel that someone close to the Stanford
scene should help prepare the Cards for the coming
event, I guess the best way would be to toss around
a couple of sample questions. So, here goes:
Directions: Rifead thife fifollowing pifasages.
Thifen ifanswer thife quifestions pifertaining tifo
thife pifassages.
(Don't let the foreign language throw you. It's just
there to see if you really met the Lower Division re
quirements. Take your time, and you'll be able to
translate the directions. But by that time, the allowed
period for the reading paragraph will be over. Go on
to the next set of questions undaunted. Stay loose. If
you would have had time, this is what you would have
banged heads with.):
Professor Linstcin recently discussed the latest
developments in atomics in one of his many research
papers. Assuming you have read this extremely
important document, the formula "cyß' @ 47c per

cance. Now R' represents the rutabaga crop avail

But all kidding aside, Stanford Roughs must be
advised about these aptitude-testing devices. Surely
you must know, or have met, one of those haggard-
Rooking characters wandering around campus who
took the Legal Aptitude Test a couple of weekends
ago. Well, those guys haven't recovered yet. And
their test was brewed up by the same Princeton
outfit.
Just ask 'em what they think about the 11th Fed
eralist paper, or the export-import figures for the
United States in 1753. or the get-one-of-the-under
stored - words - out-of - this -paragraph - to - improve -
tjie-meaning type questions. Of course, the future
lawyers' exam was a six-hour ordeal. The Feds are
Ijeing easy on us, and cut the sentence down to a mere
three hours.
The test itself really isn't too hard. Why the Stan
ford Testing Service, with the advice and consultation
of the Psychology Department, predicts that at least
somebody on campus will score high enough to quali
ty for a deferment. Of course, they are not positive
about this prediction, as their sampling effectiveness
was only 30 per cent which will allow for great error.
But, on to the test. I've overheard some RO profs
talking. They claim that it was so darned complicated
lo apply for the test, send letters and proper forms to
the local draft boards, and meet all the regulations to
£t-t an admission card to SS Aptitude, that those who
just, manage to be handed the test sheet should be al
lowed to continue their higher education.
Why, I heard of one guy who got so loused up
in trying to take the exam this May 20 that his draft
board in Watsonville thought he was trying for OCS.
Anyhow, he's now at Fort Benning, (ia. And that's
not a peachie situation, no matter how you look at it.
Kven if the boys back at Princeton get the picture

that you are applying for the Aptitude Test, they are
bound to foul you up by giving you the wrong date
at the wrong center. Or vice-versa. It can be hard as
heck on those sunmmer vacation plans.
But let's get back to the test itself. Not to go into
competition with the good men who wrote the learned
book, but I feel that someone close to the Stanford
scene should help prepare the Cards for the coming
event, I guess the best way would be to toss around
a couple of sample questions. So, here goes:

ago. Well, those guys haven't recovered yet. And
their test was brewed up by the same Princeton
outfit.
Just ask 'em what they think about the 11th Fed
eralist paper, or the export-import figures for the
United States in 1753. or the get-one-of-the-under
stored - words - out-of - this -paragraph - to - improve -
tjie-meaning type questions. Of course, the future
lawyers' exam was a six-hour ordeal. The Feds are
Ijeing easy on us, and cut the sentence down to a mere
three hours.
The test itself really isn't too hard. Why the Stan
ford Testing Service, with the advice and consultation
of the Psychology Department, predicts that at least
somebody on campus will score high enough to quali
ty for a deferment. Of course, they are not positive
about this prediction, as their sampling effectiveness
was only 30 per cent which will allow for great error.
But, on to the test. I've overheard some RO profs
talking. They claim that it was so darned complicated
lo apply for the test, send letters and proper forms to
the local draft boards, and meet all the regulations to
£t-t an admission card to SS Aptitude, that those who
just, manage to be handed the test sheet should be al
lowed to continue their higher education.
Why, I heard of one guy who got so loused up
in trying to take the exam this May 20 that his draft
board in Watsonville thought he was trying for OCS.
Anyhow, he's now at Fort Benning, (ia. And that's
not a peachie situation, no matter how you look at it.
Kven if the boys back at Princeton get the picture

that you are applying for the Aptitude Test, they are
bound to foul you up by giving you the wrong date
at the wrong center. Or vice-versa. It can be hard as
heck on those sunmmer vacation plans.
But let's get back to the test itself. Not to go into
competition with the good men who wrote the learned
book, but I feel that someone close to the Stanford
scene should help prepare the Cards for the coming
event, I guess the best way would be to toss around
a couple of sample questions. So, here goes:
Directions: Rifead thife fifollowing pifasages.
Thifen ifanswer thife quifestions pifertaining tifo

(Don't let the foreign language throw you. It's just
there to see if you really met the Lower Division re
quirements. Take your time, and you'll be able to
translate the directions. But by that time, the allowed
period for the reading paragraph will be over. Go on
to the next set of questions undaunted. Stay loose. If
you would have had time, this is what you would have
banged heads with.):
Professor Linstcin recently discussed the latest
developments in atomics in one of his many research
papers. Assuming you have read this extremely
important document, the formula "cyß' @ 47c per
pound eijuals 0.0000000})" must have some signifi
cance. Now R' represents the rutabaga crop avail
able in the United States. . . .
Questions:
1. Kinstein is how old?
a—three, b—so, c—7o, d—no longer living,
e—unable to answer.
2. His formula is wrong. It should read: .. equal,
. . ." a—O.OOOOOOON, b—0.0000090. <•—0 00WI, d—
000 000009, e—o (J!>.
.1. The passage is chiefly concerned with:
a—Farm crops in the U.S., b—Kiustein's rerrea

For answers, a further discussion of sample ques
tions, and the poop on the actual administration of the
test, be sure to see some other Bull Session.
