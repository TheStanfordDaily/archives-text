# SPRING GRIDDERS
## Practice Introduces New Plays in Saturday Prep 
### 
Chuck Taylor gave his gridders an assortment of new plays yes
terday in preparation lor this Saturday's final intra-squad scrim
mage. The offensive outfits were given several pass and run plays,
including some bootleg passes and new trap plays.
For the second day in a row, the grid field assumed the propor-

tions of a track as Taylor had
his charges run through 100-yard
races. The staff has been trying to
decide just where the speed lies.
Winning their respective races

were Boh Meyers, Bob Griffin, Gordy
Kice, Boh Iloegh, and Jack Bickel.
The mentors singled out Ron
Cook as looking sharp on offense,
while Gary Kerkorian, Barry Smith,
Loren Ilinkleman, and Ron Kadie
got plaudits for their defensive
work.
Guard Dick Borda is still in the
hospital with a broken arm, but
half Bill McMahon has sufficiently
recovered from his injury to come
out for practice.
Bill McColl, All - American end,
will probably miss this Saturday's
final scrum. McColl has come up
with an injured knee, and although
he could possibly play, the coaches
aren't taking any chances.
Saturday's game will be at I p.m.
in the Stanford Stadium. Admis
sion is free.
