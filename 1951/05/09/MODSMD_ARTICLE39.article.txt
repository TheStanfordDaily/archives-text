## OARSMEN Cards Hunt Bear, Husky 
### 
The Indian varsity crew left by
air coach at 2 o'clock this morning
for Seattle. Both the first boat and
a frosh eight, which financed its
own way by train, will race the na
tion's best — California and Wash
ington—on Lake Washington Satur
day.
Rowing at the long distance for
the first time this year, the Cards
will battle for honors over a three
mile course. If the weather gets
bad and the wind strong, the race
will be moved to a new, protected
2%-mile course near Seward Park.
Both Cal, which has had a full
racing schedule already including
races with New Zealand and Aus
tralia, and Washington, defending
national champs and regatta hosts,
are experienced at the longer dis
tances.
According to final workouts,
Coach Jim Beggs has the varsity
boating set at: Sam Stearns, stroke;
