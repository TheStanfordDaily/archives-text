### "DIGGER" ODELL 
Last Friday's spring scrimmage under the "coaching" of various
sports editors around the Bay Area was worth a million dollars of
publicity according to Don Liebendorfer, Stanford Athletic News
Director. From now on through the coming fall grid season the
Cards will probably be referred to in most of the papers as "my
boys" or 'my team."
The one thing we're worried about now is what's going to hap
pen every time Stanford wins a game. Are the city papers going
to say, "Under Coach Chuck Taylor's brilliant tutelage the Stanford

Indians crushed Podunk U," and so j
forth, or are they going to write the ;
game up something like this:
"My boys, the Stanford Indians,
crushed Podunk U yesterday, 49 to
0. Remembering my spring traiinng I
orders last May, the team executed j
my plays faultlessly and easily ]
downed a Podunk team under inex
perienced coaching . . ."
At any rate, the sports writers
learned quite a few things about
coaching last week — especially i
how tough the job is. For one
thing, they discovered that a
football coach can see very little,
if anything, of a game from bis j
position on the bench.
The sports editors also found out [
that coaching isn't a matter ol |
thinking up tricky plays and then :
watching them work for 90 - yard
TD's. Sometimes they don't work!
Aftermath: Ever since the re
cent football blowup, every time a
sports columnist criticizes a coach,
people suddenly come to the con
clusion that he's trying to get rid
of the coach. Let me say right
now that I am not conducting a
Weiershauser-Must-C»o campaign.
In all fairness to Weiershauser, I
believe that he probably ranks' in
the upper half of all the track J
coaches in the country as far as j
coaching ability goes. But a col
umnist writes for the information of
the public and not for the publicity
of a team, and when he believes i
that criticism is due about the j
coaching or anything else concern- |
ing the coach or the team, then it ,
is up to him to print it.

of the coach. Let me say right
now that I am not conducting a
Weiershauser-Must-C»o campaign.
In all fairness to Weiershauser, I
believe that he probably ranks' in
the upper half of all the track J
coaches in the country as far as j
coaching ability goes. But a col
umnist writes for the information of
the public and not for the publicity
of a team, and when he believes i
that criticism is due about the j
coaching or anything else concern- |
ing the coach or the team, then it ,
is up to him to print it.
