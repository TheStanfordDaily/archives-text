# Kids Need Sunshine, School, Play--and Your Help

WAITING FOR THE BELL—Children in the "Runabout" unit line
up outside their school room, under the supervision of two of
the teachers. Four hours of school is a daily part of the children's
program Monday through Friday for bed patients, too. Teach
ers from public schools teach several grades in one room, just
like a country schoolhouse.


TIME OUT FOR LUNCH—Under the watchful eyes of a giraffe,
Paul, Alfred, Elizabeth, Joseph, and Adele have a snack in the
dining room where the "Runabout" children have their meals.
The fox behind them may have to beg for his grapes, but the
children at the Con Home don't have to beg for good food and
plenty of it, a vital part of their care.


BACK TO CLASSES—In the "Runabout" school room, Bill, Ste
ven, Eileen, and Norman cluster around the alligator Alexander,
a new addition to the home. The children are learning about
alligators and have even written a song about Alex. Such group
projects as this and the "science calendar" in the background,
where they post the daily weather, add interest to school.
While the "Runabouts" attend school in sunny classrooms,
books and teachers are brought to the bedside of patients in the
other wards. Keeping up with their classmates who are in public
schools is very important to the sick children.


A KNOTTY PROBLEM—"I don't want to be in a newspaper,"
said Slava, at right. "I do," said Sandy, left. So here they both
are, displaying a knot board used by the Cubs. Cubs and Brown
ies are popular after-class activities for bed patients as well as
"Runabouts," and craft work is participated in by all children in
the afternoons and evenings. Materials are brought to the bed
patients, while the children in the up-and-about ward have craft
activities in their playrooms and the OT workshop.
