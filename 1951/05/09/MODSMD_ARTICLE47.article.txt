# Sam McDonald, Modest Friend Of Con Home, Loves the. Children
## 
### JACK McDONALD 
Mrs. Helen Miner, assistant I
.superintendent of the Stanford
Convalescent Home, had been
telling what Sam McDonald had
done for the kids there. She
paused a moment in her praise, ,
then said:
"I'd call Sam one of the great
ones."
And wc were inclined to agree
with her, having just come from
one of the only three interviews
Sam has allowed in his 67 years.
Wc had to talk to Mrs. Miner
about Sam's work for the Con
Home, because Sam, the modest Di
rector of Athletic Buildings and
Grounds, wouldn't pat himself on
the back. That's not Sam.
IN Years Ilcre
But he did tell of some of his j
experiences and smile over his i
memories of 48 years on the Farm, j
Sam started working here in 1903.
Four years later he was appointed [
t.o the position he now holds.
Reaching back into his fabulous j
memory, he recalls that Con Home
Drives started in 1922. Since then
he - has been the official barbecue i
chef on Sam McDonald Day—set,
aside traditionally to honor officially i
the man who has done so much for i
the Con Home kids.
We asked Sam if he had any se- |
crets or special tricks in preparing
the steaks that are so often praised !
by alumni and students.
"No," he smiled modestly. "I've !
54i>t no secrets. A lot of people tell !
mo how good my meat is, but it's
really just talk. If people talk
enough, they'll have you believing i
anything."
28th Coil Home Barbccue
This Sam McDonald Day will
mark his 28th Con Home barbecue. |
But he's been at the job of frying
steaks longer than that.
lie recalls when barbecuing was a
professional job, "a real specialty.' j
"In the early days you'd have to
pay a man $.'5O or $40 to do the job,
and that was a lot of money in those ;
days." Sam started barbecuing for j
groups and clubs to save them the
price of the professional job.
Paul McKee, who was captain of j
Ihr track team in 1911 or '12 (Sam's j
usually infallible memory is under
standably a bit hazy on this detail), |
asked Sam if he'd cook some steaks !
for him and "his lady friend." And
Sam said he couldn't have refused
had he wanted to.
A Wonderful Friendship
So began a year-round tradition j
that was the beginning of a "won- i
dcrful friendship with students."
Thai the friendship has lasted j
through the years is attested to by !
the fact that every year alumni and
their sons and daughters come back j
to see Sam in his oflice back of the j
Sunken Diamond. Sam says he
wouldn't be surprised to sec a
grandchild of an early student
come in and see him. They don't
seem to forget.
Con Home nurses don't spare
their praise for Sam. They remem
ber the "victory garden" he devel
oped for the Home in World War I.
The three-acre "garden" was closer
to a farm, on which he grew pota
toes, corn, beans, and tomatoes, sup
plying convalescing kids with fresh
vegetables, scarce during the war
yea rs.
Sam financed the job, buying his
own seeds, and did most of the
work.
Itirthday Parly
The kids pay him tribute every
.lan. 1, his birthday, with a dinner
in his honor, after which Sam sings
a song or tells the kids one of his
many stories. "The dinner really
starts the year ofT right for me," he
says.
He's writing a book about Stan
ford now. "People come and go,"
he says,"and I've been around a
long time. I want to get it down in
writing before it gets too fuzzy."

Ho hopes to h;ivc Feg Murray,
! Stanford graduate and one of his
j good friends, do the illustrations,
and he hopes to have it published
by the Stanford University Press.
"But I'll take care of those things
later. I want to get it down first,"
he says.
In his 48 years at Stanford, Sam
j feels he's sensed "a changing gen
eration," which he'll try to put into
words in his book.
He will also tell of incidents like
the student strike of 190G which W.
P. Fuller, now on the Stanford
Board of Trustees, tried to break
up. Sam recalls the strike had the
administration worried for a while.
The issue was banning beer drink
ing on campus.
Tells of Earthquake
He'll also tell of the earthquake
that rocked the campus and toppled
towers the same year. He recalls
the confusion, the terror, and the
helplessness of 30 seconds when the
earth trembled and "trees whipped
the ground." He hopes to finish the
book by the end of this year.
We thought we glimpsed some
thing of the legend of Sam, McDon
ald in our half-hour chat with him.
Something of the modesty, the hu
mility. the generosity we'd heard so
much about. We found it to be un
mistakably real.
Sam admits his "spirits are all
keyed up for Con Home Week." "I'd
give the Home my heart if I could,"
he says.

The three-acre "garden" was closer
to a farm, on which he grew pota
toes, corn, beans, and tomatoes, sup
plying convalescing kids with fresh
vegetables, scarce during the war
yea rs.
Sam financed the job, buying his
own seeds, and did most of the
work.
Itirthday Parly
The kids pay him tribute every
.lan. 1, his birthday, with a dinner
in his honor, after which Sam sings
a song or tells the kids one of his
many stories. "The dinner really
starts the year ofT right for me," he
says.
He's writing a book about Stan
ford now. "People come and go,"
he says,"and I've been around a
long time. I want to get it down in
writing before it gets too fuzzy."

Ho hopes to h;ivc Feg Murray,
! Stanford graduate and one of his
j good friends, do the illustrations,
and he hopes to have it published
by the Stanford University Press.
"But I'll take care of those things
later. I want to get it down first,"
he says.
In his 48 years at Stanford, Sam
j feels he's sensed "a changing gen
eration," which he'll try to put into
words in his book.
He will also tell of incidents like
the student strike of 190G which W.
P. Fuller, now on the Stanford
Board of Trustees, tried to break
up. Sam recalls the strike had the
administration worried for a while.
The issue was banning beer drink
ing on campus.
Tells of Earthquake
He'll also tell of the earthquake
that rocked the campus and toppled
towers the same year. He recalls
the confusion, the terror, and the
helplessness of 30 seconds when the
earth trembled and "trees whipped
the ground." He hopes to finish the
book by the end of this year.
We thought we glimpsed some
thing of the legend of Sam, McDon
ald in our half-hour chat with him.
Something of the modesty, the hu
mility. the generosity we'd heard so
much about. We found it to be un
mistakably real.
Sam admits his "spirits are all
keyed up for Con Home Week." "I'd
give the Home my heart if I could,"
he says.

Mrs. Helen Miner, assistant I

Convalescent Home, had been
telling what Sam McDonald had
done for the kids there. She
paused a moment in her praise, ,
then said:
"I'd call Sam one of the great
ones."
And wc were inclined to agree
with her, having just come from
one of the only three interviews
Sam has allowed in his 67 years.
Wc had to talk to Mrs. Miner
about Sam's work for the Con
Home, because Sam, the modest Di
rector of Athletic Buildings and
Grounds, wouldn't pat himself on
the back. That's not Sam.
IN Years Ilcre
But he did tell of some of his j
experiences and smile over his i
memories of 48 years on the Farm, j
Sam started working here in 1903.
Four years later he was appointed [
t.o the position he now holds.
Reaching back into his fabulous j
memory, he recalls that Con Home
Drives started in 1922. Since then
he - has been the official barbecue i
chef on Sam McDonald Day—set,
aside traditionally to honor officially i
the man who has done so much for i
the Con Home kids.
We asked Sam if he had any se- |
crets or special tricks in preparing
the steaks that are so often praised !
by alumni and students.
"No," he smiled modestly. "I've !
54i>t no secrets. A lot of people tell !
mo how good my meat is, but it's
really just talk. If people talk
enough, they'll have you believing i
anything."
28th Coil Home Barbccue
This Sam McDonald Day will

But he's been at the job of frying
steaks longer than that.
lie recalls when barbecuing was a
professional job, "a real specialty.' j
"In the early days you'd have to
pay a man $.'5O or $40 to do the job,
and that was a lot of money in those ;
days." Sam started barbecuing for j
groups and clubs to save them the
price of the professional job.
Paul McKee, who was captain of j
Ihr track team in 1911 or '12 (Sam's j
usually infallible memory is under
standably a bit hazy on this detail), |
asked Sam if he'd cook some steaks !
for him and "his lady friend." And
Sam said he couldn't have refused
had he wanted to.
A Wonderful Friendship
So began a year-round tradition j
that was the beginning of a "won- i
dcrful friendship with students."
Thai the friendship has lasted j
through the years is attested to by !
the fact that every year alumni and
their sons and daughters come back j
to see Sam in his oflice back of the j
Sunken Diamond. Sam says he

experiences and smile over his i
memories of 48 years on the Farm, j
Sam started working here in 1903.
Four years later he was appointed [
t.o the position he now holds.
Reaching back into his fabulous j
memory, he recalls that Con Home

he - has been the official barbecue i
chef on Sam McDonald Day—set,
aside traditionally to honor officially i
the man who has done so much for i
the Con Home kids.
We asked Sam if he had any se- |
crets or special tricks in preparing
the steaks that are so often praised !
by alumni and students.
"No," he smiled modestly. "I've !
54i>t no secrets. A lot of people tell !
mo how good my meat is, but it's
really just talk. If people talk
enough, they'll have you believing i
anything."
28th Coil Home Barbccue
This Sam McDonald Day will
mark his 28th Con Home barbecue. |
But he's been at the job of frying
steaks longer than that.
lie recalls when barbecuing was a
professional job, "a real specialty.' j
"In the early days you'd have to
pay a man $.'5O or $40 to do the job,
and that was a lot of money in those ;
days." Sam started barbecuing for j
groups and clubs to save them the
price of the professional job.
Paul McKee, who was captain of j
Ihr track team in 1911 or '12 (Sam's j
usually infallible memory is under
standably a bit hazy on this detail), |
asked Sam if he'd cook some steaks !
for him and "his lady friend." And
Sam said he couldn't have refused
had he wanted to.
A Wonderful Friendship
So began a year-round tradition j
that was the beginning of a "won- i
dcrful friendship with students."
Thai the friendship has lasted j
through the years is attested to by !
the fact that every year alumni and
their sons and daughters come back j
to see Sam in his oflice back of the j
Sunken Diamond. Sam says he
wouldn't be surprised to sec a
grandchild of an early student
come in and see him. They don't
seem to forget.
Con Home nurses don't spare
their praise for Sam. They remem
ber the "victory garden" he devel
oped for the Home in World War I.
The three-acre "garden" was closer
to a farm, on which he grew pota
toes, corn, beans, and tomatoes, sup
plying convalescing kids with fresh
vegetables, scarce during the war
yea rs.
Sam financed the job, buying his
own seeds, and did most of the
work.
Itirthday Parly
The kids pay him tribute every
.lan. 1, his birthday, with a dinner
in his honor, after which Sam sings
a song or tells the kids one of his
many stories. "The dinner really
starts the year ofT right for me," he
says.
He's writing a book about Stan
ford now. "People come and go,"
he says,"and I've been around a
long time. I want to get it down in
writing before it gets too fuzzy."

Ho hopes to h;ivc Feg Murray,
! Stanford graduate and one of his
j good friends, do the illustrations,
and he hopes to have it published
by the Stanford University Press.
"But I'll take care of those things
later. I want to get it down first,"
he says.
In his 48 years at Stanford, Sam
j feels he's sensed "a changing gen
eration," which he'll try to put into
words in his book.
He will also tell of incidents like
the student strike of 190G which W.
P. Fuller, now on the Stanford
Board of Trustees, tried to break
up. Sam recalls the strike had the
administration worried for a while.
The issue was banning beer drink
ing on campus.
Tells of Earthquake
He'll also tell of the earthquake
that rocked the campus and toppled
towers the same year. He recalls
the confusion, the terror, and the
helplessness of 30 seconds when the
earth trembled and "trees whipped
the ground." He hopes to finish the
book by the end of this year.
We thought we glimpsed some
thing of the legend of Sam, McDon
ald in our half-hour chat with him.
Something of the modesty, the hu
mility. the generosity we'd heard so
much about. We found it to be un
mistakably real.
Sam admits his "spirits are all
keyed up for Con Home Week." "I'd
give the Home my heart if I could,"
he says.


MELONS COMIN' UP—Summer fun at the Con Home begins when Sam McDonald puts on one
of his famous watermelon feeds for the kiddies. The warm summer months are the occasion for
many picnics at the Home.
Mrs. Helen Miner, assistant I
.superintendent of the Stanford
Convalescent Home, had been
telling what Sam McDonald had
done for the kids there. She
paused a moment in her praise, ,
then said:
"I'd call Sam one of the great
ones."
And wc were inclined to agree
with her, having just come from
one of the only three interviews
Sam has allowed in his 67 years.
Wc had to talk to Mrs. Miner
about Sam's work for the Con
Home, because Sam, the modest Di
rector of Athletic Buildings and
Grounds, wouldn't pat himself on
the back. That's not Sam.
