# Colorful Events Have Aided Past Con Home Drives

Even World War II couldn't
stop it.
In the midst of the last inter
national battle, when khaki was
replacing the Cardinal red, girls
were taking over the top campus
offices, and Farm social func-:
tions were being shed right and
left, one Stanford tradition held
its own—Con Home Week.
Making suitable alterations to fit
the emergency, Farm coeds and I

roughs continued the physical la- J
bor, fund-collecting, and festivities j
which have marked the annual oc- I
casion honoring the Con Home kid
dies since its very beginning.
The excitement began in 1922. '
Before then funds had been raised
from private sources, but that year I
a charity drive was held to glean
students' contributions. It. then be- i
came an annual affair.
Though most Con Home Week ;
events have appeared and disap- j
peared over the years, some fea
tures have stayed the same. Labor
Day is one of these. Technically, J
the day was originated in 1920 —j
two years before the Charity Drives |
began. Work on the home was still j
under way, and students turned out i
with hoes and rakes to put the j
grounds in order.
Masked (loyalty
The Masque Ball was a feature of
Con Home Week No. 1, and eight |
years later, in 1930, a King and i
Queen contest was added. Campus |
prominonts were nominated for re- I
gal honors, and ballots sold at one j
cent each. The royalty was tint
masked in the middle of the dance. 1
Bean Day was a 1933 innovation. ■
Campus living groups served ap
ples and beans for lunch, and the 30
cents per person saved went into
the Con Home fund. But the found-*
ers of the practice had an ulterior
motive: after leaving the lunch i

j tabic hungry, students flockerl that j
I afternoon to the first Strawberry j
I Brunch.
Strawberry shortcake swirled in
j whipped cream, lots of hot, black
coffee— these hnyc been a Con
Home feature ever "since. An ex
ception came during World War 11.
when it. was a "Strawberry Punch,"
due to rationing and wartime short
ages.
Vcliiclcs Prohibited
"Buck to the Farm Day" was a
part of the '41 Con Home Wnck.
Students wore 1890-style clothing,
and no motor vehicles were allowed
011 campus. Roads were even
' blocked off to insure the absence of
| horseless carriages. A Gay 'DO's
dance culminated that year's drive.
Plastic mannikin legs to he filled
with pennies have been another
Con Home Week tradition. Toy col
| lections and tournaments in vari
| ous sports have also been regular

features. Last year a car wash and
student - faculty quiz show were
added.
Ta? Day is another regular oc
currence. When it first appeared, in
1937, "beautiful young ladies from
Roblc" sold red and white card
board squares at 10 cents each.
Printed on the tags that year was
"Keep 'em Smiling."
