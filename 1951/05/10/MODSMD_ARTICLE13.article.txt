# Workmen Fill In Chuckholes
## 
### 
Sections of Stanford's roads have
been getting a temporary face-lift
ing for the past few days as Corp
Yard workmen have boon busily
patching up holes with gravel and
oil.
Later in (he quarter, some streets
will receive an unwashed screening
of gravel, dirt, and oil, University
Business Manager Alf Brandin said.
The motive for this procedure is
thai tho dirt and oil will fill the
mailer cracks in the roads.
Brandin has recently returned
from a meeting of the Central As
sociation of College and University
Business Officers at. Purdue. While
there, and in touring other Mid
western colleges, Brandin reported
ho found other schools had the same
road and parking problems as face
Stanford.
One university, in fact, is con
templating banning automobiles
from the campus, according to
Brandin.
