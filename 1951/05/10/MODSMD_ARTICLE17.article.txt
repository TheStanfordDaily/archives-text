# COURSE EVALUATION
## Commission Considers New System 
### 
A new system of course evalua- j
i tion, to replace the experimental j
I program set up last year, is pres- j
1 ently being considered by the Stu
i dent - Faculty Education Commis- !
| sion.
This new system is aimed pri
marily at evaluating the sophomore
alternative courses courses such as j
Psychology 51, Political Science I
and 2, and others which students j
; can take to fulfill Lower Division i
; requirements.
Alberta Stover is currently or- !
j ganizing committees of 10 students
in each department to participate
jin the evaluation, and will report
to the Commission on the steps nec
j essary if the program is to be set up.
I The two major and eight non-major
j students on the committee would
attempt to evaluate the courses as
to content, text, and methods, with
| out any concern as to the "gen-j
i eral personality" of the instructor.
Bud McCord, retiring chairman of
i the commission, had told Excom a 1
I week ago that the previous manner :
jof evaluation had only produced >
! mere reactions to the instructor's I
personality.
However, as Professor John
Mothershead of the Philosophy De
| partment stated, "Since courses dif- j
j fer with the instructor, the faculty
| members should be taken into con- !
| sideration without including the |
j teacher's personality."
If the commission nives its final
I approval to this sophomore alter- ;
native evaluation system, it will lie
j instituted next year.
The commission is currently ;
I sponsoring conferences between
| seniors and instructors in each de
partment. In each case a report of !
the conference, which evaluates the
j general format of each department,
j is referred to the department head
' to be acted upon.
