# BARBECUE
## Work, Beef Highlight 'Home Day' 
### WALT MENNINGER 
Prevented for two years from a '
Con Home Work Day and a Sam
McDonald barbecue on the grounds,
students turned out en masse yes
terday to brandish hoes, rakes,
shovels, and paint brushes, and to
polish off better than a ton of bar
becued beef.
During the afternoon, amateur
painters, fortified by perfect weath
er, spent their union-free time
painting benches, toys, tricycles, and
a sand box; and the volunteer gar
deners cleaned out weeds from be
neath shrubs and around the garage
while cultivating garden plots.
Dinnertime saw more than 3,000
students overflow the grounds and
catch Jack Harper's barbecue com
mittee short on food. The beef, sal
ad, cake, and lemonade all gave out
at 6:45 with many yet to be served.
Meanwhile, students lolled about
the grounds, listened to the
"Twelfth Street Rag" strains of the
DU - Phi Delt Dixieland band,
chewed on slabs of barbecued beef
a la Sam McDonald, drank coke,
and ate ice cream.
The dinner hour was punctuated
by a short program and the intro
duction of Sam. "I want to say," he
said, "that everyone looks well
pleased on account of the good
weather in comparison to the last
two years, and probably because of
plenty to eat.
"I would like to express my
pleasure on behalf of the Convales
cent Home at the work being done.
Thank you all for everything you
have done today and in the past."
Sam, who got up at 4 yesterday
morning to light the fire for the
barbecue and who supervised the
preparation of the ton of beef, was
i attired in a long white apron on
I which was embroidered names of
i the Con Home kids. The apron, a
gift to Sam last Christmas, was
made by the kids.
Also on the dinnertime program,
which was chairmaned by Dick
Roberts, were the Soph Quartet.
! Judy Rudolph, Bill Bowles, and
Scotty Doggett, and a preview song
from "Who's Blue?" sung by Sue
I Alter. Betty Benson, George Denny,
and Rock Campbell.
Chuck Malouf was in charge of
the Con Home Day activities.
