# Farm Museum Will Be Open Next Week
## 
### 
I For the first lime in five years,
Leland Stanford Memorial Museum
: will be open to the public Tuesday
and Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.
Located just ofT Palm Drive oast
of the Chemistry Building, the Mu
seum has been closed since 1946 for
inventory and reclassification. Next
week's two - day opening will be
presented to determine the extent
of student - faculty interest in the
building's displays.
The Museum contains much more
than Stanford family possessions,
| Mrs. Robert Cross, director of the
Museum, pointed out. Ancient
Egyptian art, California Indian rel
ics, a Chinese Buddha altar, and
i mummies arc only a few attrac
i tions.
Though mobt ot the Stanfordiana
' are not yet ready for display, part
of Mrs. Stanford's fan collection
and a few of l<eland Jr.'s toys, rep
resentative of 19th - century play
things, are on display in the main
lobby. Senator Stanford's first lo
comotive, shipped around Cape
Horn in 1863. stands in a room with
California historical displays.
Much dusting, cleaning. and
marking has been necessary to pre
pare for the opening. "It took two
men two half-days to dust every
thing." Mrs. Cross said.
Plans for the reopening began last
fall after Excom toured the Mu
seum.
