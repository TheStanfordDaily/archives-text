# Intramural Reffing: A Little Thing
## 
### 
Sometimes it's the little things that make the
big ones so sloppy.
Take the Stanford intramural athletic pro
gram. On the whole, the program serves a very
useful function. Proof of this can be seen in the
high percentage of students who participate.
But just take one of the many "little things"
that goes into our intramural setup: refereeing.
Officiating the games would seem to be a
simple matter. Actually, it isn't. Intramural
managers have a tough time finding students
who are willing to blow whistles and call balls
u:id strikes.
When they do find someone who is willing,
chances are.the candidate has had little expe
rience -if any. The other day, at a baseball
gome, one of the intramural umps admitted
quite Trankly, "I don't know anything about
baseball" (sic).
During basketball season, it is reported that
things got so rough at one point that the only
qualification for office was the ability to blow a
whistle. The jobs were subsequently filled, but

we can't vouch for the results.
Intramural Director Elwyn Bugge tells us he
recognizes the refereeing problem. The direc
tor hopes a system can be worked out whereby
physical education majors will do all the ref
ereeing. It is felt that not only will these men
be vocationally interested in taking the jobs,
but will also be more qualified to do the work.
Bugge will confer with Professor John Nixon
of the Education Department today in hopes of
coming to some agreement on this point.
If the ed schoolers don't come through, how
ever, we'd recommend a series of classes for
all would-be referees at the beginning of each
intramural season. A test might even be given
at the end of the class periods to determine
whether or not the refs are qualified.
If all of this means a raise in referee's pay
from $1 per game to $1.25, we'd still be in favor
of it.
Refereeing happens to be one of those "little
things" we can correct. If we do correct it, the
results in terms of the total intramural program
will more than justify the costs involved.
