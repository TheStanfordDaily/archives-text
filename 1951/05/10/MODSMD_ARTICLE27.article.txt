(Editor's Note: Hull Session today brings you the
sequel to John (iunUier's "Inside USA"—called "In
side Stanford." Pete Grothe lias done weeks of ex
tensive research to bring to you—the reader—these
heretofore unpublished facts about Stanford.)

1. It takes 1,561 steps to walk
from Encina to Roble. (Count
em.)
2. It takes 1,002 strides to run
from Roble back to Encina.
(I didn't make it all the way. I
lagged out on the seventh lap, so
I had trackster Will Taylor do the
job.)
3. There are 272 lights on the
ceiling of Mem Aud.
4. Four thousand, eight hundred

thirty-two units of courses are taught at Stanford in
a year.
(Consider the significance of the latter item for a
moment; If a student wants to take every course given
at Stanford, it will take him a little over 80 years to
complete them |if he goes to school four quarters a
year and averages 15 units a quarter|. And this
doesn't include taking repeat courses. A person -may
take child psych when he is 19 and then decide to take
it over again when he is 89 and in his second child
hood.
(If you're the lazy type like me, you won't even

finish in Bft years. No classes before Ift, none after
12, and none on Saturday—on that rock is built my
education. That would mean 121 years for me.)
5. It takes 4,217 steps to get from the Delt House to
the Sunken Diamond.
G. There are 1,092,008 catalogued books in all the
libraries on the campus.
7. There are 1,651,071 uncatalogued books.
8. This makes a total of 2,743,079 books in the Main
Libe, Hoover Libe, and the smaller libes. (Two mil
lion, seven hundred forty three thousand seventy
nine.) w
(I've read two 12] of them.)
!#. Stanford Police give out 3,232 parking citations a
year.
(The Stanford Police Department would go bank
rupt if it weren't for me. I've received so many pink
slips that I've thought of going into the lingerie busi
ness. Why just the other day, I parked in front of a
sign that said "Fine for Parking," and still they
gave me a citation.)
lft. Stanford barbers give an average of 31,030 hair
cuts a year.
11. There is an average of 20,000 hairs on a head, so
this would mean that 630,600,000 hairs are cut per yea:-.
12. The Stanford gas station sells 504,231 gallons oi
gas and wipes 102,000 windshields in a year.
(They've never wiped mine.)

G. There are 1,092,008 catalogued books in all the
libraries on the campus.
7. There are 1,651,071 uncatalogued books.
8. This makes a total of 2,743,079 books in the Main
Libe, Hoover Libe, and the smaller libes. (Two mil
lion, seven hundred forty three thousand seventy
nine.) w
(I've read two 12] of them.)
!#. Stanford Police give out 3,232 parking citations a
year.
(The Stanford Police Department would go bank
rupt if it weren't for me. I've received so many pink
slips that I've thought of going into the lingerie busi
ness. Why just the other day, I parked in front of a
sign that said "Fine for Parking," and still they
gave me a citation.)
lft. Stanford barbers give an average of 31,030 hair
cuts a year.
11. There is an average of 20,000 hairs on a head, so
this would mean that 630,600,000 hairs are cut per yea:-.

tensive research to bring to you—the reader—these
heretofore unpublished facts about Stanford.)

1. It takes 1,561 steps to walk
from Encina to Roble. (Count
em.)
2. It takes 1,002 strides to run
from Roble back to Encina.
(I didn't make it all the way. I
lagged out on the seventh lap, so
I had trackster Will Taylor do the
job.)
3. There are 272 lights on the
ceiling of Mem Aud.
4. Four thousand, eight hundred

thirty-two units of courses are taught at Stanford in
a year.
(Consider the significance of the latter item for a
moment; If a student wants to take every course given
at Stanford, it will take him a little over 80 years to
complete them |if he goes to school four quarters a
year and averages 15 units a quarter|. And this
doesn't include taking repeat courses. A person -may
take child psych when he is 19 and then decide to take
it over again when he is 89 and in his second child
hood.
(If you're the lazy type like me, you won't even

finish in Bft years. No classes before Ift, none after
12, and none on Saturday—on that rock is built my
education. That would mean 121 years for me.)
