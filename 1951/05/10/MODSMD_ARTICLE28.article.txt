More on MaeArihur

To the Editor:
1 refer to Letter to the Editor, May 7. by Mr. Rah
rnom.
I wish that Mr. Rahmom would list the number of
American G.l.'s (and other allies) killed or maimed in
the South Pacific immediately before his sentence
about Mac Arthur doing some of the "na,sliest, hardest
fighting of the war." I think it would weaken his point.

No doubt MacArihur fulfilled his promise to "re
turn," but I'll bet the security he posted for that
promissory note was the American undying spirit for
freedom. . . . So, Mr. Kahmom, you might spread
that nice stuff, credit, around evenly.
. . . Just wanted to say in regard to recent attacks
on Messrs. Grothe and Cusick that I for one can use ;
my own marbles to judge the issues oi' today and new j
and original wit, be it for or against my idols, will al
ways be appreciated.
