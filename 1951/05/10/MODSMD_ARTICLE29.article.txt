I ROM PENNIES AND STRINGS — Phoneless! That's today's
plight of the Delta Upsilon fraternity as the telephone company
backed up its previous warning with action. Above, a DU tries
using the wireless in the now-bare fraternity phone booth. The
phones were removed from the house Tuesday because of too
many "pennies and coins attached to string." The phone com
pany has reiterated that it will not hesitate to remove other
phones if the mistreatment continues. This is the first living
group to. lose all its phones although previously phones have
been removed fiom bootln in Encina and the Village.
