# Professor Durand Leaves After 48 Years at Farm
## 
### JOY HAAS 
Yesterday Dr. William F. Durand. 92, left Stanford, his home for
nearly half a century, to be near his son, grandchildren, and great
grandchildren in Brooklyn, New York.
Professor Durand and the teaching of engineering at Stanford
are synonymous. He has held emeritus status in his department

for 27 years, probably the longest
period of emeritus standing ever
accorded a university professor,
lie came to the campus in
"ought four" and built his home
under a magnificent sprawling
oak on a hill above the Kow,
when that area was still pasture
land.
His long record of contributions
to his specialized field has earned
him the honor of being termed "the
most eminent college professor in
the field of aeronautics."
The first recipient of the Wright
Brothers Memorial Trophy, Dr.
Durand was awarded the Medal
of Merit for his contributions to
aviation during World War 11.
As he was in his 80's when Presi
dent Roosevelt called ftim to Wash
ington to take charge of a research
program on advanced types of air
plane propulsion, a youthful engi
neer remarked that this was a
young man's war and its aeronau
tics should not be trusted to grey
beards. Thinking of Dr. Durand,
another man replied:
"Well, before this mess is over
Durand will probably show us how
to fly on a spurt of air, in a plane
without propellers, at a speed closer
to a thousand miles an hour than
we've ever flown."
He did.
The Smithsonian Institute in
vited Dr. Durand to send, for
I permanent exhibition iu the In
stitute, his first variable pitch pro
peller, developed and tested at
| Stanford in lf)18.
i liiis development opened the way
! for the propeller with automatic
j pitch variation now used on all but
j jet types of military and transport
j airplanes.
j He was awarded the Presidential
, Medal for Merit by General Carl
i Spaatz. on behalf of President Tru
j man. This award, made at Moffett
I Field where much of his research
' was carried on, is the nation's high
i est medal award made to a civilian.
Dr. Durand was born in Beacon
Falls, Conn., in 1859, and while he
is back East he plans to visit the
familiar haunts of his New England
boyhood.
