# Tax Raise Ahead
## 
### 
WASHINGTON- The House
Ways and Means Committee voted
today to increase individual income
taxes $2,950,000,000 a year to help
finance the defense drive.
The increase, which is less than
President Truman asked, would
rai.se taxes in every bracket by
three percentage points. For a sin
gle man with a net income of $5,000
a year, it would mean a tax increase
from the present. $044 a year to
$1,076 a year.
