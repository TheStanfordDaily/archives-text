# 'Halt! Foe? Kachow' Sentry's on Guard
## 
### BILL STOLTZE 
"Halt! Who goes there, friend or foe : Kachow! Kachow! Ka
chow! You die!"
Thus spake the sentry on duty at his post on the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon porch Tuesday. Coeds blushed and roughs chortled when
almost every girl on her way to the post office was confronted with

the same persistent fusilade and
admonition.
Each blast with the deadly weap
on consisted of the "Kuchows" along
with the brandishing of a broom
stick on the part of the sentry. Be
sides his gun, the sentry had addi
tional protection in the form of a
lamp-shade helmet, a coal of armor
looking very much like a baseball
catcher's padding, and towel
swathed feet.
"All's Well ..."
When he wasn't issuing dire
warnings to campus coeds, the sen
try called out the time every 15
minutes at the "South Gate, Main
Gate, and North Gate." According
to SAE actives, every pledge in the
house was serving an hour's guard
duly starting from 4:30 a.m. ant!
lasting all day long.
All this meant hell week to the
pledges, and general amusement to
the actives and student onlookers,
but a further innovation meant
quite a different thing to a well
meaning lady driving up the How.
First Aid for Injured
About 11:45 in the morning a
pledge was ordered to lie on the
street in front of .the post office and
act like an injured pedestrian while
his fellows administered unto him
with blankets and directed traffic
around the post office to "save" the
"injured" man.
That was when a middle - aged
lady appeared on the scene.
She lushed up to the "injured"
man, felt his pulse, and told his
"rescuers" not to move him.
"I've got a first aid kit in my car,"
she said.
Finally the pledges convinced her
that it was all a bit joke, and the
lady left the scene of the "acci
dent." Her final comment?
"You'll grey my hair doing things
like this."
