"Give your unusual stamps for
the Con Home kids."
This plea is on cigar boxes placed
around campus by Alpha Phi Ome
ga, national service fraternity, to
collect unusual stamps for the Con
Home kids. The boxes are placed
in the Post Office, Encina lobby,
Village cashier's office, and other
central locations.
