## Midweek Musings The 						Story Behind the Story 
### 
Yesterday's announcement of the switch i:i Stanford's basketball
coaching setup has an interesting story behind the story. A tale of how
the Daily was nearly scooped on news which it had known for two weeks.
The BAC's approval of Bobby Burnett as Everett Dean's replacement was
not intended to be released until May 17 when President Sterling and the
Board of Trustees take official action on the recommendation. Nevertheless,
/ia innumerable and inevitable leaks in the official pipeline, the news has
been flowing through the student body and Bay Area sports desks since a
few hours following the BAC decision.
The Daily, although it had an official representative at the Board meet
ing, was requested not to break the story until May !7. And it did not
break it even after rumors began appearing in the columns of San Fran
cisco sports pages.
Then Tuesday afternoon, Dan Endsley (if the Palo Alto Times, decided it
was time for action. Quoth fearless Dan 1: "I just got tired of sitting on it.
Whereupon the former Daily columnist splashed the "surprise all ovei
the front page as a Times "exclusive," and released the story to the Asso
ciated Press wires.
Is Ignorancc Bliss?
Now the cat was not only out of the bag, it was meowing in newspapers j
throughout the nation. But the Daily sat in ignorant bliss, unaware of the |
premature release. For the Stanford Publicity Department, still refusing to
admit publicly the BAC action, could not very well contact our reporters
about a story the department was supposed to know nothing about.
The happy ending occurred when Karl Odell of the Daily sports staff
happened to read the Times and, realizing that the ji« was up anyway,
lapped out the news for the edification of Wednesday morning's Daily
readers.
The University, incidentally, has still not admitted the BAC decision, j
Thomas Spragens, assistant to the Presdent, stoutly holds to the line that !
here has been no official change in the basketball coaching scheme. Which, !
in so far as it goes, is true; the change won't be official until May 17.
Nevertheless, two facts can be gleaned from the confusion:
I. Kvertt Dean has retired as basketball coach and is virtually certain
to be replaced by Burnett.
1. The BAC and the President's office will in the future think twice
before trying to suppress a hot news item for three weeks.
For the Daily wasn't the only paper slighted by the indifference of the
Athletic Department. The entire incident was typical of the poor public
telalions which result from the maintenance of "secrecy" until the BAC
recommendations are officially approved by the Trustees.
Let the Public In oh II
The suggestion, of course, is that the actions of the BAC be made public
at their inception. It could be made clear at that time that such decisions '
are subject to the approval of the President and the Trustees. An alterna
ive plan would be for the BAC to schedule its meetings within a day or two
of the next Board of Trustees meeting.
As Mr. Spragens pointed out yesterday, the present policy is in line with
the general University policy applying to professorial and other appoint
ments. That is, no appointments are made public until officially approved
by the Board of Trustees.
However, because of the insistent pressures exerted by sports reporters
and their newspapers to uncover any news pertaining to sports person
alities, it is well nigh impossible to suppress the facts concerning ath
letic department appointments.
And when such suppression is attempted, confusion and damaged Stan- j
loi'd public relations are the inevitable result.

Nevertheless, two facts can be gleaned from the confusion:
I. Kvertt Dean has retired as basketball coach and is virtually certain
to be replaced by Burnett.
1. The BAC and the President's office will in the future think twice
before trying to suppress a hot news item for three weeks.
For the Daily wasn't the only paper slighted by the indifference of the
Athletic Department. The entire incident was typical of the poor public
telalions which result from the maintenance of "secrecy" until the BAC
recommendations are officially approved by the Trustees.
Let the Public In oh II
The suggestion, of course, is that the actions of the BAC be made public
at their inception. It could be made clear at that time that such decisions '
are subject to the approval of the President and the Trustees. An alterna
ive plan would be for the BAC to schedule its meetings within a day or two
of the next Board of Trustees meeting.
As Mr. Spragens pointed out yesterday, the present policy is in line with
the general University policy applying to professorial and other appoint
ments. That is, no appointments are made public until officially approved
by the Board of Trustees.
However, because of the insistent pressures exerted by sports reporters
and their newspapers to uncover any news pertaining to sports person
alities, it is well nigh impossible to suppress the facts concerning ath
letic department appointments.
And when such suppression is attempted, confusion and damaged Stan- j
loi'd public relations are the inevitable result.
Yesterday's announcement of the switch i:i Stanford's basketball
coaching setup has an interesting story behind the story. A tale of how
the Daily was nearly scooped on news which it had known for two weeks.
The BAC's approval of Bobby Burnett as Everett Dean's replacement was
not intended to be released until May 17 when President Sterling and the
Board of Trustees take official action on the recommendation. Nevertheless,
/ia innumerable and inevitable leaks in the official pipeline, the news has
been flowing through the student body and Bay Area sports desks since a
few hours following the BAC decision.
The Daily, although it had an official representative at the Board meet
ing, was requested not to break the story until May !7. And it did not
break it even after rumors began appearing in the columns of San Fran
cisco sports pages.
Then Tuesday afternoon, Dan Endsley (if the Palo Alto Times, decided it
was time for action. Quoth fearless Dan 1: "I just got tired of sitting on it.
Whereupon the former Daily columnist splashed the "surprise all ovei
the front page as a Times "exclusive," and released the story to the Asso
ciated Press wires.
Is Ignorancc Bliss?
Now the cat was not only out of the bag, it was meowing in newspapers j
throughout the nation. But the Daily sat in ignorant bliss, unaware of the |
premature release. For the Stanford Publicity Department, still refusing to
admit publicly the BAC action, could not very well contact our reporters
about a story the department was supposed to know nothing about.
The happy ending occurred when Karl Odell of the Daily sports staff
happened to read the Times and, realizing that the ji« was up anyway,
lapped out the news for the edification of Wednesday morning's Daily
readers.
The University, incidentally, has still not admitted the BAC decision, j
Thomas Spragens, assistant to the Presdent, stoutly holds to the line that !
here has been no official change in the basketball coaching scheme. Which, !
in so far as it goes, is true; the change won't be official until May 17.
