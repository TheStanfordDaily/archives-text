# Coaches Unhappy With Results Shown in Drills
## 
### 
Dissatisfaction so thick you could
cut it pervaded the coaches' locker
room after yesterday's grid practice.
When Coach Chuck Taylor was
asked to single out any boys who
had looked good, he said, "I can't.
They didn't look sharp today."
Line Coach Joe Ruetz said, "Our
blocking is not even close to what
it can be. There has been improve
ment, however. Theyre just begin
ning to show what they can do. Our
tackling is sloppy."
Many Problems to Face
"Of course, we of the staff are
bucking a tough problem," contin
ued Ruetz. "A lot of boys have late
classes and can't come out on cer
tain days. Others have to leave
early to hash. We only have an
average of 45 minutes a day to work
with each boy. We can't do any
thing close to what we want to du
with 45 minutes a day."
George Lynn, defensive backfield
coach, added another sorrowful

15)47 will hold a reunion tomorrow
afternoon at 2 at- the Portola Club.
All members are invited.

note. "I'm still trying to find the
right defensive backfield combina
tion. Dick Horn and Gary Kerko
rian have looked good, and so have
Joe St. Geme and John Gilmore,
but we're behind schedule."
For the third day in a row, 100-
yard races were held. Winning theii
respective dashes were Harry Hu
gasian, Skip Crist, Ron Eadie, Boh
Latham, Irv Gustafson, Tony Gar
rett, and Bob Mueller.
Two More Join McColl
Two more veterans from last
year's team joined Bill McColl on
the sidelines. Jesse Cone has a
nasty boil on the neck, and his neck
is encircled in bandages. He'll miss
Saturday's final scrimmage. Guard
Norm Manoogian may also miss the
scrum because of an injured ankle
McColl has a slightly injured
knee, and would be able to pla>
Saturday; but the coaches aren't
taking any chances with the All -
American end. They reason it's toe
great a risk for an intra - squad
game.
Ruetz worked the centers, guards

and tacklcs on downfield blocking,
and gave them a review of assign
ments.
The last part of the practice was
j devoted to scrimmaging, with the
| emphasis on passing. Gary Kerko
rian, Dick Horn, and Bob Garrett
j were connecting consistently, al
though the pass protection left
[ something to be desired.
