## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
State Dean Achcson said today it
is outrageous for Russia to demand
that the Western powers halt their
rearmament program as a condition
for holding a Big Four foreign min
isters' conference.
Acheson's blunt statements at a
news conference indicated that the
United States is getting thoroughly
fed up with the attitude displayed
by Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromy
ko at a meeting of Big Four depu
ties in Paris.
