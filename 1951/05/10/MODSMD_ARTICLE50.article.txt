# Crew\ Has Troubles With Sickness, Sleep
## 
### 
Jim Beggs, Stanford crew coach,
was cautious before he left for Se
| utile yesterday in his predictions
| about the Indians' success in the
| Washington Kegatta this Saturday.
"Conditions being what they are, |
we have not yet come to the point j
where I would like to be for this
I race," said Beggs.
He gave several reasons to sup
! port his claim of unpreparedness.
Most important seems to be a loss
| of manpower in the first two boats.
| An epidemic of sickness in April
resulted in the permanent loss of
Don Craven and Bill Meyer, vet
eran starboard powerhouses.
Field Is Out
Andy Field, jayvee six oar last
! year, developed a heart murmur
which separates him from the sport,
i Dewey Hecht, also a top port con
j tender, has been out of workouts
! for the past two weeks with an in
| jured back, and is just now getting
| in shape for the three-mile races.
These and other complications
have kept the boating in a state of
flux, and have given Beggs a head
' ache in trying to iron out subtle
timing problems. Timing is best
solved by many miles of rowing
! with the same men permanently to
gether, and has been impossible so
, far this season for the Indians.
"We have had some very nice
time trials —and some correspond
ingly bad ones,'" said Beggs. He
added that one of his chief con
cerns is with the inability of the
crew to row consistently.
Erratic Training Schedules
Perhaps this lack of consistency
j can be traced to the erratic train
i ing schedules kept by the oarsmen.
It seems that sleep—one of the in
tangibles of sports—is a major crew
I problem. Because the workout
| schedule calls for boats on the wa
ter by 5:10 a.m., and the studies
; must be kept up. sleep becomes a
j preciuos commodity.
Hardest pressed for shut-eye arc
j the engineering students. Beggs said
j they averaged between five and six
j hours a night. The four engineers
I in the varsity boat are Sam Stearns,
Bob Farnsworth, Jim Filer, and
Chief Hendrickson.
Fqupinu'iit Problem, Too
The equipment problem — always
a tough one for the indigent In
dians—has been particularly acute
this quarter. Beggs estimates he
j loses one workout a week due to
' j launch breakdowns.
"It all adds up to the fact that we

| aren't as far along as we should be," I
Beggs cautioned.
"However," he added, "if there IS
one thing you can count on, it is j
that the boys will row their hardest, j
These money troubles and training |
difficulties don't show up when it
I comes to sheer guts."

"We have had some very nice
time trials —and some correspond
ingly bad ones,'" said Beggs. He
added that one of his chief con
cerns is with the inability of the
crew to row consistently.
Erratic Training Schedules
Perhaps this lack of consistency
j can be traced to the erratic train
i ing schedules kept by the oarsmen.
It seems that sleep—one of the in
tangibles of sports—is a major crew
I problem. Because the workout
| schedule calls for boats on the wa
ter by 5:10 a.m., and the studies
; must be kept up. sleep becomes a
j preciuos commodity.
Hardest pressed for shut-eye arc
j the engineering students. Beggs said
j they averaged between five and six
j hours a night. The four engineers
I in the varsity boat are Sam Stearns,
Bob Farnsworth, Jim Filer, and
Chief Hendrickson.
Fqupinu'iit Problem, Too
The equipment problem — always
a tough one for the indigent In
dians—has been particularly acute
this quarter. Beggs estimates he
j loses one workout a week due to
' j launch breakdowns.
"It all adds up to the fact that we

| aren't as far along as we should be," I
Beggs cautioned.
"However," he added, "if there IS
one thing you can count on, it is j
that the boys will row their hardest, j
These money troubles and training |
difficulties don't show up when it
I comes to sheer guts."
Jim Beggs, Stanford crew coach,
was cautious before he left for Se

"Conditions being what they are, |
we have not yet come to the point j
where I would like to be for this
I race," said Beggs.
He gave several reasons to sup
! port his claim of unpreparedness.
Most important seems to be a loss
