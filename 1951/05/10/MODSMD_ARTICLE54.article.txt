# There's a Busy Life at 'Padre's' Con Home
## 
### BEVERLY BOCK 
Little Timmy in the bed ward
told me about the Indian village j
he and his fellow pre-schoolers
are making. He proudly pointed
to the clay Indians, the kettle
hung over a fire, and the tepees
made of leather scraps.
A youngster named Steven
showed me the one-and-one-half
year-old alligator. Alexander, which
whs recently presented to the chil
dren. He wanted to know how big
the reptile would grow from its
present one-foot length. He sadly
decided that when it got big it
! would have to go live "in the
I ocean."
Three boys, just old enough to be
j Boy Scouts, had a "cookout" with
j their Scoutmaster last week. Since
j they had no place for an outdoor
j fire, they had to use a stove in
| doors—but the spirit was there just
the same.
These are some of the HO ehil
| dren at the Stanford Convalescent
Home, where a year-round en
vironment of good food, lots of
sleep, healthy play, and busy
hands and minds is provided for
! children with illnesses which need
long periods of recuperation.
About 35 years ago Stanford's
' first chaplain, Dr. D. Charles Gard
ner, affectionately known as "Pa
dre," decided that sick children in
San Francisco's clinics and hospi
tals weren't allowed to stay long
enough to recover completely from
illnesses which needed long rest pe
| riods.
With the help of a group of stu
dent social workers whom he had
| organized and other friends, he ar
ranged a summer camp for some of
| these children on the Stanford cam
pus, using the Isolation Hospital as
a home.
Two years later, in 1920, the chil
j dren were moved into Senator
s Stanford's three - story summer
home. This house and the accom
! panying 26 acres, with the addition
of three units donated through the
j years, is the present site of the
j Convalescent Home.
Children come to the C'on Home
after the initial stages of such ill
nesses as rheumatic fever have
passed, when they no longer need
the close medical attention of a
hospital hut still must have plenty
of rest and good nourishment.
When they arrive at the Con
Home, the children, who arc four to
12 years old, are underweight, pallid,
listless. After six to eight months
there (the average stay, though the
maximum is usually a year), they go
home heavier, healthier, and happier.
One girl, suffering from asthma and
poor nourishment, gained 40 pounds
j in six months.
This care, which is so necessary to

these children, is entirely supported
by charity. The list of groups con
tributing is endless—the Menlo Cir
cus Club, San Francisco Community
Chest, Elks, Rotary, and various
women's auxiliaries of the Con Home
on the Peninsula. Stanford is the only
university which supports a charity
of this kind.
Children in the home are divided
into two groups, the bed patients
and the "runabouts," who may, as
their name implies, he up and
about most of (he day. There are
2;» beds in each of the two bed
wards, and .'{o beds in the "run
about" unit.
"Runabouts" lead a life much
like normal children of their ago,
with four hours of schooling each
day, except for a two-hour rest pe
riod in the afternoon. If you talk
to them, they'll tell you about their
playground with a slide, teeter-tot
ter, swings, and sand box. They'll

tell you about the girls' tree house,
j the boys' clubhouse, and the life
j sized three-room playhouse which
j is furnished like a real house with
I dishes, stove (it really works), fire
place, chairs, and tables.
Keeping the bed patients busy is a
j harder task, but the Con Home staff
j does a good job of this, too, School
, is brought to them in bed, as is
i craft work of various types, includ
; ing weaving and woodwork.
Weekends bring such special fun
jas parties, circuses, carnivals,
i "chuck wagon" dinner, or playing
I cowboys.
