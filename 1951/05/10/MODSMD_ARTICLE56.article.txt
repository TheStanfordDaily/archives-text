# Con Home Kids See Programs
## 
### 
Once each year the Stanford stu
j dent body goes all out, as they are
doing this week, for "their kids" at
| the Convalescent Home.
But the kids don't forget Stan
ford during the rest of the yearâ€”
| due in large part to the activities
| of the new Con Home Entcrtain
! mcnt Committee, which is headed
by Encina sponsor Fred Chez.
The committee, which was origi
! iiatcd by Chez at the beginning of
j this school year, puts on a monthly
I one - hour entertainment program
; for the children at the home, fea
turing student talent of all kinds.
| The ASSU allots the committee $5
J each month to buy candy for the
! children, which is a featured at
| traction at each program.
Members of the Con Home staff
hope the committee will become a
| permanent institution. The only
j criticism they find with the entcr
| tainment is that the children somc
j times get too enthusiastic for their
own good.
Anyone interested in working on
J the committee is asked to contact
j Chez at Encina. "No special talent
lis necessary," he says."The only
requirement is a sincere interest in
kids."
