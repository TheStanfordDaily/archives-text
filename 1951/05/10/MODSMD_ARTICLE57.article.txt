## Research Takes the Long View 
### 
Fundamental studies are one
of the most important phases
of Du Pont research
Fundamental research is designed to
discover new scientific facts without
regard to specific commercial use. Yet
from it have come many products
of commercial significance.
At Du Pont, for instance, funda
mental research has pointed the way

io products like nylon, the first
wholly synthcticorganic textile fiber,
and neoprenc chemical rubber, to
name only two.
Expanding for Tomorrow
Willi the expectation that still more

"products of tomorrow" will conic
from the test tubes, flasks and
stills of the research laboratory, the
Du Pont Company recently expanded
its Experimental Station near Wil
mington. In this thirty-million-dollar
addition, major emphasis is being
given to long-range and fundamental
research.
The enlarged Experimental Sta
tion with its 20 new buildings rcprc-

scnta one of the largest and host
equipped research establishments in
the world. Even so, less than half of
the Company's total research per
sonnel is situated here. Du Pont lab
oratories in more than 25 other loca
tions also carry on both fundamental
and applied research.
There arc now about 800 technical
people engaged exclusively in re
search work at the Experimental
Station. Assisting them arc 1,500
others, in technical and non-technical
capacities. The research people repre
sent a wide range, of training. Among
them arcorganie, inorganic, physical,
colloid, analytical chemists and bio
chemists; physicists and biophysi
cists; chemical, mechanical, metal
lurgical, electrical and electronics
engineers; plant pathologists, plant

physiologists, agronomists, entomol
ogists, horticulturists and others
trained in biological science. In ad
dition, there are specialists who
arc not classified in any of theso
groups.
Free for Research
Al the Du Pont Experimental Sta
tion every effort is made to permit
the research man to concentrate on
research. He is provided with the
most modern laboratory tools and for
the construction of special equipment
he can call on a wide variety of serv
ices. These include machine shops,
carpentry,electrical, welding, instru
ment-making, and glass-blowing
shops. When the research worker
needs any service or equipment with
in the scope of these shops, it is pro
vided for him.
At this industrial research labora
tory, Du Pont scientists are devoting
themselves to extending the fron
tiers of science and creating "Bettor
Things for Better Living ... through
Chcm istry."
