### GORDON McKIBBEN 
Chappie has been suspended!
Following Wednesday's edition
of "Crash Comics," publication
of the campus humor magazine
was suspended indefinitely yes
terday by University authorities.
"The Chaparral has been right on
the borderline of good taste for
quite a while," Dean of Students
:H. Donald Winbigler commented
j lat;t night.
The suspension was levied at a
special meeting yesterday afternoon
| by Winbigler, with the approval of
1 the Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, a University administrative
committee.
Committee members include Pro
fessors George H. Knoles, Alfred H.
Grommon, Paul H. Kirkpatrick, and
Oswald G. Villard.
University Standards
| Under the ban, publication of the
Chaparral will not be permitted un
til the University has assurance
from Hammer and Coffin, society
| which puts out the magazine, that
the publication will live up to Uni
| versity standards.
"In my opinion, there is no rea
son why we can't, have a humor
[ magazine that, meets acceptable
standards of good taste," Winbigler
jsaid.
Winbigler did not elaborate on
specific instances of poor taste in
the May issue. Certain lines in the
"take-off" strips "Little Organ An
-1 nie," "Prince Vasaline," and "Pran
cy" were generally thought to be
among the objectionable material.
"Quite a Lot"
Stan Norton, Chappie editor, told
The Daily that he had cut out
! quite a lot"' before okaying Crash
i Comics.
Refnre last year's comic edition
went to press, it was seen by Direc
j tor of Information Fred Giover, at
j the request of the Chappie staff,
I after Dean Kimpton had questioned
1 several items.
Rrplates (delations) made by the
i staff and a few made at the sugges
i tion of Glover cost the Chappie a
large amount.
Financial Blow
The Chaparral is hit hard fman-
I dally by the suspension. Most ad
vertisers are on a nine-month con
\ tract, calling for insertion of ads in
j each issue. One more issue was
, scheduled for this year.
The Chaparral is owned and op
erated by Hammer and Coffin. Top
staff positions are open only to so
i ciety members.
Ironically, the Chaparral itself in
its April issue had editorialized on
the low level of college humor mag
azines, according to a release from
the Information office.
Editorial
In connection with its annual ex
j change issue, made up of jokes,
cartoons, and articles selected from
j other college humor sources, the
managing editor of the Chaparral
wrote that following review of 200
other publications he noted that
"Many have wandered, perhaps un
consciously, from the paths of true
; humor into the dangerous no man's
I land of triteness, pure corn, and un
disguised vulgarity."
The editorial went on gloomily to
forecast that either the magazines

were going out of business for lack
of student support, or that if several
magazines were severely chastised,
unjustifiably or not, for being "off
color." the editor feared that an in
ter-university purge would follow,
and the Chaparral would suffer
along with everyone else.
The editorial expressed the hope
that other college humor magazine
editors would join him in a sincere
effort to keep college humor on the
high plane of which it is capable.
Dean Winbigler commented wryly
that the Stanford Chaparral staff
should have heeded its own edito
rial.
Not First Time
This is not. the first time the
Chappie has been in trouble. Just
last year an advertisement involv
ing the Bryan brothers, Gay and
Bob. threatened to make the track
stars ineligible.
During the Tresidder administra
tion, one issue was suspended but a
financial mixup was involved. The
Chappie was published on an issue
to-issue basis, subject to the Presi
dent's approval, at that time.
As far as oldtimers on campus
could remember, this marks the
first time that the Chappie publica
tion has been suspended strictly for
printing objectionable matter.

Editorial
In connection with its annual ex
j change issue, made up of jokes,
cartoons, and articles selected from
j other college humor sources, the
managing editor of the Chaparral
wrote that following review of 200
other publications he noted that
"Many have wandered, perhaps un
consciously, from the paths of true
; humor into the dangerous no man's
I land of triteness, pure corn, and un
disguised vulgarity."
The editorial went on gloomily to
forecast that either the magazines

were going out of business for lack
of student support, or that if several
magazines were severely chastised,
unjustifiably or not, for being "off
color." the editor feared that an in
ter-university purge would follow,
and the Chaparral would suffer
along with everyone else.
The editorial expressed the hope
that other college humor magazine
editors would join him in a sincere
effort to keep college humor on the
high plane of which it is capable.
Dean Winbigler commented wryly
that the Stanford Chaparral staff
should have heeded its own edito
rial.
Not First Time
This is not. the first time the
Chappie has been in trouble. Just
last year an advertisement involv
ing the Bryan brothers, Gay and
Bob. threatened to make the track
stars ineligible.
During the Tresidder administra
tion, one issue was suspended but a
financial mixup was involved. The
Chappie was published on an issue
to-issue basis, subject to the Presi
dent's approval, at that time.
As far as oldtimers on campus
could remember, this marks the
first time that the Chappie publica
tion has been suspended strictly for
printing objectionable matter.
Chappie has been suspended!
Following Wednesday's edition
of "Crash Comics," publication
of the campus humor magazine
was suspended indefinitely yes

"The Chaparral has been right on
the borderline of good taste for
quite a while," Dean of Students
:H. Donald Winbigler commented
j lat;t night.
The suspension was levied at a
special meeting yesterday afternoon
| by Winbigler, with the approval of
1 the Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, a University administrative
committee.
Committee members include Pro
fessors George H. Knoles, Alfred H.

"In my opinion, there is no rea

jsaid.
Winbigler did not elaborate on
specific instances of poor taste in
the May issue. Certain lines in the
"take-off" strips "Little Organ An

among the objectionable material.
