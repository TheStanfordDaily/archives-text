# Victim of Zete Blaze Praises Farm Firemen
## 
### 
Stanford football players Bill Mr-
Coll and Doug Pinto lost an esti
mated $1,000 worth of belongings
yesterday when their room on the i
third floor of the Zeta Psi house !
S was completely gutted by fire.
Bill Storum. Farm track star, dis- j
covered the blaze at 4:28 in the af- '
ternoon while looking for a car to j
borrow for an errand in Palo Alto.
|He seared his hand when he
1 touched the door knob of the burn- *
; ing room.
Storum. whose track specialty is \
] the 440. ran the 400 yards from the j
[ Zete house to the Firehouse on
Santa Teresa Street and by 4:30 a
fire truck was speeding to the scene
| of the blaze.
Pinto was quick to praise the |
work of the fire department, but
| the discovery of the fire was too late
to save anything in the room. It is
thought that faulty wiring of an !
outlet in one corner of the room
may have been responsible for the
conflagration.
A rough estimate of $1,000 dam
age to personal effects and another
$1,000 to the building was made.
Although the fire was confined to
a single room and a house insur
ance policy covers the losses, money
cannot replace the scorched text
books and ruined notebooks of both
men. MrColl also lost almost all his j
clothing including his All-Ameri
can sweater.
Heat of the blaze was so intense i
tli:Â»t a fountain pen became a twist- 1
cd blob of plastic and a typewriter !
I was rendered completely useless. I
