# 'Old Boy' Explains...

### STAN NORTON 
An editorial appeared in the April Chappie in which the Old (i.e.,
the Editor) hoped that a sincerc effort would be made to keep college
humor magazines on a high plane. Ho still feels this way. He is convinced
that the Chappie, so long as it fulfills this ideal, plays a real and worth
while role as a member of the Stanford Family.
The Chappies cannot help but take pride in knowing that Stanford has
for years enjoyed the reputation of having one of the finest college
humor magazines in the country. W'c have never intended that any
issue of the Chaparral should defacc our national or our Stanford
reputation.
Tastes in humor vary considerably and cannot be judged in terms of
black or white. In attempting to make people laugh we have unfortu
nately hit upon a deep shade of grey. On behalf of the Hammer and Coffin
Society I apologize for this error In good judgment.
