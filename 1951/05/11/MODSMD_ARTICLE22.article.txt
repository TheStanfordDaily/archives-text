# Rebirth for Block and Circle 'S'
## 
### 
We've heard a lot in the past few years about
how Stanford athletics were gradually recover
ing from the recession enforced by World War
11. By now, the teams have resumed their pre
war strength, and it remains for the athletes
themselves to develop organizations similar to
the pre-1942 status of the Block Sand Circle S
Societies.
Next Tuesday evening, the Student Athletic
Committee will sponsor a program designed
primarily to bring Block and Circle S members
together for the purpose of electing officers
and making plans for the ensuing year.
This affair will be the first formal meeting of
either group in the past couple of years. In
fact, neither society has any form of official
organization at present. The few activities
sponsored in recent times have been social af
fairs, which received poor attendance at that.
Neither group elected any officers this year.
The Student AthJetic Committee hopes to
reactivate the societies, and to merge the two
together, so lar as their service function is
concerned. The status of the major and minor
sports is to be left as is.
We agree wholeheartedly with the sponsors

of the idea that a fusion of the two groups into
a Block and Circle S Athletic Society with defi
nite organization and officers is needed. An
active athletic society is necessary to encour
age athletics and greater participation in athlet
ics at Stanford. If such goals were attained, it
would mean even greater Indian teams.
That of itself would benefit students as a
whole, but the possibilities of the proposed
organization do not end there. Additional serv
ices in the realm of athletics would be the host
ing of visiting high school athletes and similar
functions. Furthermore, there are undoubtedly
some general campus functions which the
group could perform.
Prior to the war, a close-knit Block Sand
Circle S did perform such functions, to the
benefit of Stanford. But the election of officers
and the formation of plans are necessary pre
liminaries to the development of an esprit de
corps that will produce an adequately function
ing athletic society.
And we therefore urge all Block Sand Circle
S men to attend the meeting Thursday and give
their support to the rebirth of a once-prominent
Stanford brotherhood. 8.8.
