### DICK McLEAN 
As every farm has its watchdog and every town its
"character/' so Stanford has its George. Now George,
sometimes called Big Fellow, is one of the most fa
miliar personalities seen under our arches and around
the sandstone pillars. He is a trim dog, built for speed,
with his six-inch legs and his 16-inch underslung
body. His parentage is somewhat of a mystery. It is
believed that his grandfather was an outcast dachs
hund, who swore he had a pedigree a mile long. Un
lurtunately the dachshund was a scoundrel and a liar.
But despite George's doubtful ancestry and hi.s small
- i/.e, tie is proud. Nobody ever told George that he is
a little; dog and little dogs should be humble. So
George romps from-class to the Cellar to his colonial
home as master of all the manor.
George is fond of attending classes but he pick.s
them with discrimination. He seems to favor econ
classes because they have the best selection of gum
: luck underneath the seats. Since econ majors are
richer than most, they chew their gum less and thus
leave more flavor. Sadly, George's conduct in class is
not the best.
He wanders throughout the room greeting friends
and looking for a warm seat in the sun. Once settled,
he promptly goes to sleep. His favorite game in class
is to find a dust mouse, blow it into the air, and then
bat at it until it falls apart or gets in his nose.
George is not very courteous, either. If the lec
ture that he happens to be attending grows dull,
lit' wags a "goodbye" to his friends and departs, hap
pily chomping on a fine wad of gum. Some say that
he is still at Stanford after four and a half years be
cause of these frivolous habits. Others say that he is
working on his master's thesis.
On his morning rounds George usually pays a visit

to the Reserve Book Room, Cubberley Auditorium,
the big pillar in front of the Main Library, and the
Cellar. It was in Cubberley Auditorium that George
won himself the title, '"Big Fellow." His authority as
master of the manor was challenged by a huge, indo
lent collie. George would not forbear this affront to
hi.s dignity. He climbed up un one of the seats, looked
the wolf squarely in its shifty eyes, and attacked. Like
David in the Bible he came oft' victor because his heart
was pure.
It is seldom that George misses a big campus ac
tivity. You are likely to see him at a track meet,
jogging around the track after the 880 men, or on
the football field mugging at the television cameras.
He was on the reception platform to greet President
Sterling at his installation. They nodded to one an
other, the two masters of the manor, and thereby
worked out an unwritten truce. George would leave
the Administration alone if President Sterling would
leave the gum under the seats alone.
But George is growing old. He never attends eight
o'clock classes any more. He sleeps longer in the warm
sun and grows more tolerant of dull lectures. A few
white hairs are beginning to bristle through the black
.spots on his face. He walks slower but with the same
noble bearing. He refuses to sleep on the leather
chairs downstairs; he prefers the warm foot of a bed
where he nestles in a ball and snorts if you try to move
your feet.
Although George may grow old and die, the legend
that is George Big Fellow, the Lion Hearted, will
ever remain fresh where the immortal Quad and the
timeless foothills meet. For he is a campus charac
ter rich in memory of those who love him and like all
campus characters he will never fade away, only die.
