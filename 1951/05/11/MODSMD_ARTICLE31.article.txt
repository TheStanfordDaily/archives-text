# New IIR Handbook to Assist Stanford Student Travelers
## 
### 
About 200 residents of European
and Latin American countries ex
pect to welcome student travelers
from Stanford and other California
colleges during the coming summer.
Former exchange students, re
cipients of SIRO aid, and profes
sors in foreign universities are
among the overseas contacts in
cluded in an IIR-published guide
book to summer travel now avail
able- to Stanford students.
For the third year in a row, the
11R has compiled "Introduction to
Europe and Latin America." As a
free service to Stanford travelers,
the handbook combines a maximum
of personal and organizational con
tacts overseas with basic travel in
formation.
Consulates and national travel
agencies of the various countries
have kept the 11R posted this year
on current road and railway condi
tions, hotel rates and rationing, cli
mate. and currency regulations.
Publication ol the handbook was
held until this month so the last
cultural event scheduled for the
coming summer could be included.
Sample copies and sign-up sheets
will be posted in the major living
groups and in the 11H Shack until
May 16 for delivery before the end
of May.
All information and names in the
handbook, plus current files on
study, travel, and work abroad,
are now available at the IIR Travel
Bureau to students planning to
leave the country this summer.
From Monday to Thursday between
4 and 5:150, prospective tourists will
find help with their summer plans
at the lIR Shack.
