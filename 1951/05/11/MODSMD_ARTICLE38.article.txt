# Final Grid Scrum Tomorrow
## Garrett, Bickel Get Chance to Show Stuff In Stadium as Football Bows Out Until Fall DAILY Sports 
### PETE GROTHE 
Football, spring style, does its bow-out at 1 p.m. tomorrow as
Chuck Taylor's charges romp through the third of three intra-squad
games. Free programs will be handed out, and the students will
enter the Stadium tariff-free.
Now that Bill Leiser and his cronies have gone back where they

belong and Taylor and his pals have
left the confines of the press box,
funs can expect to see a more co
hesively tutored outfit.
All week long, the coaches have
been stressing passing, and the fun
damentals — blocking and tackling.
The squad has been given several
new trap and bootleg pass plays,
and they should be in evidence to
morrow.
Vets Bill McColl, Norm Manoo
gian, and Jesse Cone will sit out
the serum with injuries.
The game will help determine
how well the objectives of spring
practice have been fulfilled. Line
tutor Dutch Fehring stated the ob
jectives as following:
1. To find who can plav offense,
especially guards, tackles, and
fullbacks.
2. To try several new plays and
find out which ones will work.
.'{. To improve blocking, tack
ling, and pass protection.
■1. To experiment defensively—
both with personnel and from a
team defense standpoint.
5. To phue the players in the
position where they will play next
fall, so changes will not have to
lie made next season.
<i. To find out to what extent
the platoon system can he used
next year.
Several new nuggets have been
discovered in spring practice. Watch
ior halfback Ron Cook, end Sam
Morley, linebacker Ted Tanner,
guard Phi! Wilson, tackle Whitey
Pyle, and hail Jim Auble. Also
quarterback Bob Garrett and half
backs Billy (Scooter) Heilbron and
Wes Laubscher. There boys will
play a large part in the success or
unsuccess Stanford is to have next
year.
Also watch Harry Hugasian. The
hipster is running as of old.
A lot of experimenting will be
done with quarterbacks Garrett and
Jack Bickel. The coaches want the
two lo %et a lot of game condition
action under their belts. Vets Gary
Kerkorian and Dick Horn will see
defensive duty as well as offensive
action. The staff knows what Kerk
and Horn can do offensively, so
they want to experiment with them
defensively.
