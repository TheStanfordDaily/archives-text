# MURAL IMPROVEMENT
## 
### 
Anyone having a helpful sug
gestion concerning the improve
ment of the intramural program
is urged to contact Mr. Elwyn
Bugge at the intramural office.
It is hoped that students will con
tribute ideas that will be helpful
in revising the program where
changes or corrections should be
made.
