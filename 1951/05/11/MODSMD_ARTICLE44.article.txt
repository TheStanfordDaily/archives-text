# Cal Hosts Swimmers
## 
### 
Coach Tom Haynie's Card swim
mers will ride over to Berkeley to
morrow morning to take on Cal's
Bears lor the second time.
The team is looking over tomor
row's meet to the PCC meet at UC
LA next weekend, but they should
still win by a large margin. Hay
nie announced this week that he
would swim his four best sprinters
in an effort to lower the PCC free
style relay record they set last
week. Bob Thompson, Bert Holi
day, Bruce Putnam, and Phil Chap-

man will swim 100 yards each, and
if they do their best times, the team
should do about 3:27, as compared
with the record of 3:31.
Highlight of yesterday's workout
was Thompson, who spun a 220 in
2:08.1, two full seconds under his
previous best mark. This is the
best time ever done by a West Coast
athlete, including Jack Mediea,
Washington's great Olympic swim
mer of the late 'thirties. Thompson
will not swim the 220, however,
i against Cal, but will concentrate on
I the relay.
Haynie has been impressed with
the work of Putnam in backstroke,
and senior sprinter Bob Grisemer.
Putnam did a 50 backstroke in 27
seconds Tuesday, and should be
J able to do a 60-second 100, accord
ing to Haynie.
Grisemer, a "find" from last year's
| intramurals, did 37.4 for a 75-yard
training race, the fastest of the
day.
