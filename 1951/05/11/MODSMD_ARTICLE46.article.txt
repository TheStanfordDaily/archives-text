# Reds Row At Seattle
## 
### 
Stanford's hard - luck orphans, i
underdogs with big hearts, get the j
chance of a lifetime tomorrow in
Seattle when the oarsmen row !
against Cal and Washington. Three
races are on tap for the Lake Wash- j
ington course with the varsity shells
scheduled for 4:30 p.m.
The biggest spring sports event in ]
the entire Northwest, the Washing- j
ton Regatta annually matches Cal 1
and Washington, the two best shells !
in the country. Cal represented the
United States in the '48 Olympics.
Under A 1 Ulbrickson, long - lime
Husky crewmaster, Washington has
attained a fantastic rowing record.
Last year, the three Husky shells |
swept the Nationals at Marietta. |
One of the top strokers on this j
year's boating is the coach's son, A 1 !
Ulbrickson Jr.
This will be the second of three |
meetings between Cal and the
Cards. Last time out, the Indians j
gave way at the half-way point and
went on to lose by less than three
lengths. In that race the Indians
easily outstroked SC and UCLA.
Tomorrow's races will be at the
longer three-mile distance, a factor
that should be tough on the less I
experienced Cards. Both the Hus
kies and the Bears handle the long
coui'se with ease.
A last-minute change in the first
boating returns captain Jim Filer
to stroke, his post last year.
