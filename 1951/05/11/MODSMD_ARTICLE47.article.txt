# Frosh Hiders Outslug Marin JC, 10-9
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
The frosh baseballers pounded out
a sloppy, 10 to 9, win over Marin JC
yesterday on the local diamond.
The Papooses waged an uphill bat
! tie all the way. Mike Acker, after
i three sparkling performances, had an
! off day. In the first six frames, he
| was tagged for six runs. The frosh,
i meanwhile, were manhandling Marin I
starter, Tony Franchini. They threat- i
I ened every inning, but were only able ;
j to push in five runs on eleven hits.
In the bottom of the sixth, the dam j
burst. Pitcher Acker singled. War
ren Goodrich hit a double-play ball
j which Marin converted into a two- i
| base error. Next Ralph Cassidy, who
banged out three hits, got on when
the second-baseman tried to nab
Acker coming home.
Next it was Joe Miller hitting into
another double play that failed. Two
! luns scored while Marin was kicking
| Miller's grounder around. Ray
S warts, Jack Gebert, and Terry
j Evans smashed out hits and the frosh
; led, 8 to 6.
The frosh scored two more in the
eighth on singles by Cassidy and
Miller. Marin kept pounding away at
Acker, but they lost their chance to
tie when a runner was thrown out at
home in the ninth.
Acker thus joined the spectacular
! Don De Long as ace of the team with I
four wins against no set-backs. These
two lads and Phil Page (5 and 2) have
j shouldered the brunt of the hurling
chores. The team has now won 15
out of 18.
Frank Tenerello and Olie Suzdaleff

have deserted the team for football
and basketball, respectively, so that
the new lineup generally consists of
Goodrich at short, Cassidy at third,
Miller in left field, Swarts in center,
Gebert at second, Evans in right, Bill
MolTet at first, and Clark Nelson be
hind the plate.
Today the frosh will battle Tamal- I

pais High. Tomorrow morning at
10:15 they will meet Alameda High.
