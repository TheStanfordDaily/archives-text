# Spring in Stitches
## 
### 
The old axiom, "One way to get what you like is to do it
yourself," was never truer in sewing than it is this year,
when clothes are combining such fabrics as zephyr-weight
woolens and tissue sheer crepes. These new dressy mate
rials are especially important to the college girl, whose
sewing at school is fairly well limited to date dresses or
clothes for costume parties.
Embossed cottons with their textured design which looks
as if it had been woven into the fabric are also style news.
These share the limelight with the brilliant border print
cottons that are used in six-paneled aprons that flutter May
pole fashion from shaft-like navy linen dresses. Other mate
rials making their debut this season are light chiffon flannel
and silken worsted serge.
The ever popular plain or gaily patterned glazed chintz
has been joined by a new satin-like cotton which is treated
to a high polish, giving solid colors a soft luster. This sea
son the Irish have finally joined the Scotch in plaid linens.
And best of all, most of these materials are either washable
or crease-resistant, or both.
Splashy designs are hitting the cottons again this year in
full force. The result for the college woman is a readv source
of vivid and eye-catching prints for quickly-made dirndl
skirts for Quad wear. For the girl who doesn't sew these are
a blessing, too. With a few pins and deft tacks these fab
rics go to a South Sea island or peasant dance before being
carted home during the summer for mom to put into a
more permanent garment.
