# Flowery and Formal
## 
### 
Foriualwear is sneezing at its name 111 i- year and
in the breeze is blowing itll into clouds of silver
rose mist, united lilac, lime-ice green, and organdy
over sinning yellow. In this tulle fairyland, light
and airy are the informal keynotes.
I'"veil in men's clothes the tux shirts are becom
ing increasingly comfortable, and attached collars
are the rule except for very formal affairs. And in
California, as always, the white dinner jacket is
popular, although it never quite replaces the tradi
tional and time-honored double breasted tuxedo in
midnight blue.
In women's dresses, organdv is often appliqucd
or embroidered, "l'risin" materials, with the color
shading from light to deeper color and even I nun
one hue to several others, are new. A strong seller
this season, too, is organd\ with colorlul 1 fit polka
dots as large as quarters. "Frosted" ilowers on
varicolored thin materials are now washable, and
nvlon is entering the evening fashion world in nei
fi in n.
Stoles are shifting from plain to partiall\ hidden
rhinestone studs and sequins. 11 ems are often
shown off the floor with a dip in hack or longer
overskirts, and oversheathed hemlines are saucily
/ig/agged. I )elicate yet durable lace is at its best
over colored silk taffeta slips. And the slip itself,
following the new "now it's under, now its' not"
routine, is often a finished dress to be accented with
soft flowers or heavy strands of rope pearl.
In the accessory line, scatter pins that stick to
the skin with a special glue are the latest. Formal
half-jackets called windbreakers. with not quite
sleeves and little high collars, are taking the spot
light with dusters of silk and marquisette.
