# Sugar, Spice, and Dates

From martini to coke dates, dressy clothes are
stealing tricks from the formals this year. ()r maybe
it's the other way aronnd, since formal attire is
losing the still touch. At any rate, the twain is
meeting.
\\ liile women's clothes are tending either to the
brilliant metallic or Huffy pink and lilac for the very
dressy frocks, men's suits are sticking to the con
seryatiye. Smaller, unpadded shoulders on men's
suits fall in straight line on a blocked coat, and
patch pockets are in vogue. Lapels are not as
prominent, and single breasted suits are most popu
lar.
Two-button coats rank high, along with the
three-button. Conservatism, so long established in
suits, has even entered the tit* and shirt picture with
white plaids, small prints, and pin stripes. Only
the boldly checked sport coats break the conserva
tive pattern.
Sheers over taffeta slips of a contrasting or deep
ening color have entered the women's cocktail field
and brought with them a new color of primrose
touched with blue. The sheers are sharing the
full-skirt arena with glitter threaded materials and
the dusty yet glowing pewter and copper fabrics.
Many of the skirts have tiny, scattered patterns.
In the coke-aud-show date line, pique and linen
are holding their own. Navy and yellow are per
haps most often seen, and two-piece dresses with
crisp peplum rate high. Bolero jackets over strap
less dresses, making two outfits, have been intro

duced for city wear. Skirts arc straighter in these
heavier materials.
Dusters have entered the silk and velvet field,
and often the duster is crocheted or knitted for date
wear. Also, for dates stoles have a hit ■ t lace at
the edge. Starched lishnet is one of the new stole
ideas.
Make-helieve and real flower touches are dress
ing ii]> cottons as well as the dressier fabric* this
spring. Worn at the waist, throat, or lapel, they
freshen up any ensemble. Jeweled buttons are giv
ing sparkle to even the darkest costumes.
For very dressy occasions shell shoes are being
cut down even more to form the new divide shoe.
The rainbow is hitting earth in the newer shoes,
with French beige, sherbet and a mellow buttery
shade matching gloves and purses. Many of the
shoe styles combine not only two colors but two
materials. More popular than ever are the shoes
dyed to match the dress. And with these shoes,
of course, go the new hosiery with geometric and
ilower designs uj> the heel or side.
Ilats are getting in on the new spring shades in
shantung to match dresses and suits. These are
fitted close to the head, usually, and often have a
few scattered and twinkling pins on them. Xewest
in the millinery department are the " Kiss Me Kate"
hats, veils which are tied with a bow on the back
of the head and can be worn alone or on an actual
hat. However, the pique cloches are taking the
spotlight again this year.

From martini to coke dates, dressy clothes are
stealing tricks from the formals this year. ()r maybe
it's the other way aronnd, since formal attire is
losing the still touch. At any rate, the twain is
meeting.
\\ liile women's clothes are tending either to the
brilliant metallic or Huffy pink and lilac for the very
dressy frocks, men's suits are sticking to the con
seryatiye. Smaller, unpadded shoulders on men's
suits fall in straight line on a blocked coat, and
patch pockets are in vogue. Lapels are not as
prominent, and single breasted suits are most popu
lar.
Two-button coats rank high, along with the
three-button. Conservatism, so long established in
suits, has even entered the tit* and shirt picture with
white plaids, small prints, and pin stripes. Only
the boldly checked sport coats break the conserva
tive pattern.
Sheers over taffeta slips of a contrasting or deep
ening color have entered the women's cocktail field
and brought with them a new color of primrose
touched with blue. The sheers are sharing the
full-skirt arena with glitter threaded materials and
the dusty yet glowing pewter and copper fabrics.
Many of the skirts have tiny, scattered patterns.
In the coke-aud-show date line, pique and linen
are holding their own. Navy and yellow are per
haps most often seen, and two-piece dresses with
crisp peplum rate high. Bolero jackets over strap
less dresses, making two outfits, have been intro

duced for city wear. Skirts arc straighter in these
heavier materials.
Dusters have entered the silk and velvet field,
and often the duster is crocheted or knitted for date
wear. Also, for dates stoles have a hit ■ t lace at
the edge. Starched lishnet is one of the new stole
ideas.
Make-helieve and real flower touches are dress
ing ii]> cottons as well as the dressier fabric* this
spring. Worn at the waist, throat, or lapel, they
freshen up any ensemble. Jeweled buttons are giv
ing sparkle to even the darkest costumes.
For very dressy occasions shell shoes are being
cut down even more to form the new divide shoe.
The rainbow is hitting earth in the newer shoes,
with French beige, sherbet and a mellow buttery
shade matching gloves and purses. Many of the
shoe styles combine not only two colors but two
materials. More popular than ever are the shoes
dyed to match the dress. And with these shoes,
of course, go the new hosiery with geometric and
ilower designs uj> the heel or side.
Ilats are getting in on the new spring shades in
shantung to match dresses and suits. These are
fitted close to the head, usually, and often have a
few scattered and twinkling pins on them. Xewest
in the millinery department are the " Kiss Me Kate"
hats, veils which are tied with a bow on the back
of the head and can be worn alone or on an actual
hat. However, the pique cloches are taking the
spotlight again this year.

dressy frocks, men's suits are sticking to the con
seryatiye. Smaller, unpadded shoulders on men's
suits fall in straight line on a blocked coat, and
patch pockets are in vogue. Lapels are not as
prominent, and single breasted suits are most popu

Two-button coats rank high, along with the
three-button. Conservatism, so long established in
suits, has even entered the tit* and shirt picture with
white plaids, small prints, and pin stripes. Only
the boldly checked sport coats break the conserva
tive pattern.
Sheers over taffeta slips of a contrasting or deep
ening color have entered the women's cocktail field
and brought with them a new color of primrose
touched with blue. The sheers are sharing the
full-skirt arena with glitter threaded materials and
the dusty yet glowing pewter and copper fabrics.
Many of the skirts have tiny, scattered patterns.
In the coke-aud-show date line, pique and linen
are holding their own. Navy and yellow are per
haps most often seen, and two-piece dresses with
crisp peplum rate high. Bolero jackets over strap
less dresses, making two outfits, have been intro

duced for city wear. Skirts arc straighter in these
heavier materials.
Dusters have entered the silk and velvet field,
and often the duster is crocheted or knitted for date
wear. Also, for dates stoles have a hit ■ t lace at
the edge. Starched lishnet is one of the new stole
ideas.
Make-helieve and real flower touches are dress
ing ii]> cottons as well as the dressier fabric* this

freshen up any ensemble. Jeweled buttons are giv

For very dressy occasions shell shoes are being
cut down even more to form the new divide shoe.
The rainbow is hitting earth in the newer shoes,
with French beige, sherbet and a mellow buttery
shade matching gloves and purses. Many of the
shoe styles combine not only two colors but two
materials. More popular than ever are the shoes
dyed to match the dress. And with these shoes,
of course, go the new hosiery with geometric and
ilower designs uj> the heel or side.
Ilats are getting in on the new spring shades in
shantung to match dresses and suits. These are
fitted close to the head, usually, and often have a
few scattered and twinkling pins on them. Xewest
in the millinery department are the " Kiss Me Kate"
hats, veils which are tied with a bow on the back
of the head and can be worn alone or on an actual
