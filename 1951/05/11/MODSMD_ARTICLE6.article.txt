men will journey to the Raisin

place honors and gold watches, while
Stanford and Occidental squads bat
tle for second place.

dians lack the individual stars that
nearly upset the heavily favored
Trojans at Fresno last year, but will
present a well-balanced entry in
most of the relay races.

who still is hobbling on a sprained
ankle, the Cards are in the best shape
of the season. Discus thrower lan

ter with teammates Bob Mathias and
Chuck Renfro tomorrow.

Relay events in his high school days

discus for the Indians. His best toss
this season is slightly over 160 feet,
and he bettered that mark by five feet
in a foul throw at Berkeley last week.

up the order of the Card mile relay
team in hopes of getting a winning
combination. As it stands now. soph

sprint relay duties. Darrell Krcitz of

weather workouts under their
belts, Stanford's varsity track
men will journey to the Raisin
City, Fresno, tomorrow to par
ticipate in the first big post
season meet of the year, the
West Coast Relays.

again favored to walk away with first
place honors and gold watches, while
Stanford and Occidental squads bat
tle for second place.

dians lack the individual stars that
nearly upset the heavily favored
Trojans at Fresno last year, but will
present a well-balanced entry in
most of the relay races.

who still is hobbling on a sprained
ankle, the Cards are in the best shape
of the season. Discus thrower lan
Reed, who has been out for several
weeks, will be ready to toss the plat
ter with teammates Bob Mathias and
Chuck Renfro tomorrow.

Relay events in his high school days
at Tulare, will be favored to win the
discus for the Indians. His best toss
this season is slightly over 160 feet,
and he bettered that mark by five feet
in a foul throw at Berkeley last week.

up the order of the Card mile relay
team in hopes of getting a winning
combination. As it stands now. soph
