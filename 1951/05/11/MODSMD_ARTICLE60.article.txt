# Spring Fashions
## Color Parade on Quad 
### 
11k* ring-art >nnd-Onad between-class bus
tie this spring is a color extravaganza, with
dice and Kgyptian print skirts competing with
I lawaiian and l'apa shirts.
For the men this represents a break from
the conservative trend in dressy clothes.
I 'astel and print shirts are competing with the
increasingly popular T-shirt, which lias
grown from its post World War II plain
white into colors, patterns, and crew and polo
neck styles.
However, the patterned sweater is appar
entlv temporarily dead, and nylon combined
with other materials is quickly invading the
sweater line. Balboa bines have replaced
levis as best seller, and arc followed by khakis,
grays. and cords, in that order.
For the women, clothes this spring show
much more texture consciousness. Wal'lle
pique, linen, and crinkles share top billing.
The nightshirt dress and sleeveless dress with
softly rolled back collar are newest in
cotton clothes. Qneen Elizabeth Hopped neck
lines are "in" again this year. In pockets,
basketweaves and straw that stand stiffly
away from the material are seen frequently.
( )n the whole, cotton dresses are softer,
plainer, and more practical than in the past
few vears.

(>n the ever-present skirt and peasant
Mouse front, the newest prints are heraldic
shields, <1« >t and dash codes, stained glass
blocks, and dice prints. There i> also a choice
o! surrealism, scenes, and (irandma Moses
patterns.
Colors have not changed much this year.
Lilac is still out in front, with a new sunlight
yellow slipping into second place. Lace and
emhroiderv insets are still popular. Incident
ally, it looks as though hemlines have de
cided to stay put for awhile.
Shoes are in the fashion color wheel, too,
thi> year. Lven the men are taking up the
trend in this line, with the new gore-front
slip-on, laceless shoe and nvlon mesh in ox
lords and loafers. Crepe soles have received
their death notice because of the rubber short
age. and brush leather or buck will be going
back to the leather and composition soles of
postwar days. White continental stitching
Irom toe to heel is also popular.
(iayly-tinted Mary Jane and shell flats are
replacing winter's saddles little by little. De
signed by "the dancer's cobbler" Capezio,
who shod the casts for "Allegro" and "Briga
doon." these shoes are now available in al
most all colors and styles Irom orange leather
to pale lilac linen.

slip-on, laceless shoe and nvlon mesh in ox
