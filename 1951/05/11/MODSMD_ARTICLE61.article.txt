# In the City Promenade
## 
### 
Biggest of the fashions floating high, wide, and handsome in the city
this year is the ensemble look. Dresses have their own matching or
contrasting coat, and cuffs turned hack ahove the wrist are often a piece
of the dress material.
Besides the basic coats, wraps accent the cape, pyramid, or bloomer
sleeve. These come in such striking shades as red. chartreuse, and
figured white 011 black. From the duster to the unpadded pyramids,
coats are swooping out at the sides. And inside these billowing coats
go the tie-silk sheath dress, sleeveless and with a high neckline.
Suits this season have accent on the hipline. The arched hips, stiff
pockets, and peplums set a smaller looking waistline. The slightly
wider, Paris-inspired sloped shoulder accents a softer and more femi
nine silhouette. Soft, rolled collars frame a deep or modified \ -neck
line. And some collars stand away to frame the face, while some suits
are collarless. Suit skirts are still straight, but now are often cut with
hidden pleats or slits. Suits with two skirts, one matching and one con
trasting, are popular.
Color, fashion decrees, is anything you like. The newest combination
for city wear is black and blond, a light honey shade. As always, black
and white is predominantly shown, but also in the running are the pur
ples, golden tones, pinks, greens, and blues. Beige with pink under
tone is found in many of the dresses.
Collar and cuff touches range from crisp, white pique to soft, black
velvet. Flowers, either real or make-believe, are used everywhere at
the waist, the lapel, the collar. And very new hemlines are featuring
horsehair to hold the hem to shape, any shape.
Perhaps the most welcome of all city innovations is the addition of
dark cottons and pique to the towmvear list. This idea, brought out in
New York this vear, can be expected to dominate the summer scene in
San Francisco.
Adaptations of the little great-eoats top the knitted dresses for city
wear. The shortie h;is taken on a new look this season with deep arm
holes, push-up or elbow length sleeves, and cape collar.
