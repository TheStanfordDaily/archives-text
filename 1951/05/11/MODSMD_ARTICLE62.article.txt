# Nomad Summer
## 
### 
The traveler need only remember two words
when selecting clothes — comfort and practicality.
Rut this year this task is made easier by the light
weight, durable materials that are being shown in
clothes of all styles.
Good news for the voyager this year is the fact
that nylon prices have come down since last year,
despite rising prices in other lines. Nylon has the
advantage of packing easily and drying quickly, and
is almost indispensable for European travel, where
laundry facilities are at a minimum.
Rentberg, nylon, seersucker, spun rayon, jersey,
light weight woolens, and shantung arc high on the

easily-packable list. These materials should be
chosen in simple and becoming styles, and clothes that are going to be
used for sitting on buses and trains should be dark. Nylon is not the
coolest of fabrics, and persons who will be in South America or south
ern Italy during the hottest months should look for light weight nylon,
which will withstand the hottest temperatures.
Keeping luggage at ;i minimum is another perennial problem. Both
men and women should take a suit that can either be a little dressy or
just for town wear, and it should have a hard enough finish so it will
not wrinkle in packing. Men usually take two pairs of slacks and a sport
coat with two or three white shirts (these are best in nylon). Women
should take one or two skirts, usually one wool and one dirndl, and two
or three blouses. One or two dresses for traveling and a dressy date
dress are a must, and men need a dark suit.
It will depend on where you go whether or not you will need tux or
evening dress. One good all-around coat that is not too heavy to carry
is a necessity, and if a woman needs an evening wrap, light weight wool
shortie capes are good. Unless you plan to spend all ot your time at a
resort, one bathing suit, a sun outfit, and a bathrobe that can be used
for beach wear will suffice.
Comfortable walking shoes, two pairs, arc a must. Break them in
for a good two weeks before you leave so you can leave the corn plasters
at home. ()nc pair of dress shoes and a pair of sandals that can double
as house slippers can complete the foot department.
Women should take a large bag. the shoulder ones are preferable,
and men should have a folder large enough to hold passport and large
currency.
()nc pair of levis or pedal pushers is usually a good idea, as are dark
glasses (also an extra pair of glasses, if you wear them) and a light
weight or cellophane raincoat, lint remember to leave enough room in
the suitcase for things you will want to buy that you will not want to
stuff in baskets, where von carry the rest of your "loot."

Good news for the voyager this year is the fact
that nylon prices have come down since last year,
despite rising prices in other lines. Nylon has the
advantage of packing easily and drying quickly, and
is almost indispensable for European travel, where
laundry facilities are at a minimum.
Rentberg, nylon, seersucker, spun rayon, jersey,
light weight woolens, and shantung arc high on the

easily-packable list. These materials should be
chosen in simple and becoming styles, and clothes that are going to be
used for sitting on buses and trains should be dark. Nylon is not the
coolest of fabrics, and persons who will be in South America or south
ern Italy during the hottest months should look for light weight nylon,
which will withstand the hottest temperatures.
Keeping luggage at ;i minimum is another perennial problem. Both
men and women should take a suit that can either be a little dressy or
just for town wear, and it should have a hard enough finish so it will
not wrinkle in packing. Men usually take two pairs of slacks and a sport
coat with two or three white shirts (these are best in nylon). Women
should take one or two skirts, usually one wool and one dirndl, and two
or three blouses. One or two dresses for traveling and a dressy date
dress are a must, and men need a dark suit.
It will depend on where you go whether or not you will need tux or
evening dress. One good all-around coat that is not too heavy to carry
is a necessity, and if a woman needs an evening wrap, light weight wool
shortie capes are good. Unless you plan to spend all ot your time at a
resort, one bathing suit, a sun outfit, and a bathrobe that can be used
for beach wear will suffice.
Comfortable walking shoes, two pairs, arc a must. Break them in
for a good two weeks before you leave so you can leave the corn plasters
at home. ()nc pair of dress shoes and a pair of sandals that can double
