# Sunny Side of Fashion
## 
### 
Faded blue denim 1 la> blossomed into colors this year, with pink and
white taking the lead in snn attire. As in other lines of clothing, mate
rial texture is most important.
Sturdy sailcloth, often with sailboat prints, has been fashioned into
pedal pushers and jackets in a variety of bright colors. Manufacturers
have rediscovered Indian head in plain colors and prints, while terrv
cloth has been pushed into a predominant place this season.
Shorts have gone plaid, in even such fabrics as linen. The cotton
boxer and plain shorts are also available in bathing suit stvles. Cotton
jersey T-shirts in pastels and loud stripes with plunging and crew
necklines are displayed with shorts and pedal pusher outfits.
Special emphasis on matching and mix-and-niatch costumes is im
portant again in the fashion world. Sets consist of halter top. shorts,
blouse or bolero, and skirt. Most often these combine plain colors with
prints and plaids rather than a whole outfit in, say, print.
For those who prefer a somewhat dressier note in their casual clothes,
linen is the answer. This crisp, versatile material can be found in not
only shorts and pedal pushers, but also sun dresses. The sun dresses
this year are also taking to sailcloth along with sturdy cotton and pique
in a motley of bright figures and scenes. Brushstroke plaid effects are
perhaps the most striking innovation to the sun dress line.
Beach bags are again matching the costume or in bright white with
a hooked-rug look. The straws with (lowers and cherries grouped on
top are also hack. Sporty bunches of artificial (lowers are also being
worn on sun dresses and at blouse collars with shorts.
Perhaps the most convenient new article in sun clothing is the stole
with pockets, big and deep, that can be tossed on and off again and
allow comfortable carrying of cream bottles and make-up in coolie
fashion.
Sun hats this year are being shown in straw sombrero tvpc. These
are decorated with everything from horses and spider straw animals to
roses and cactus, all in straw. The ever-popular railroad sun hats have
come out in pink and blue denim and sailcloth, besides the white sailcloth
i>l last seas<mi.
Sandals have gone Mexican to match the sombrero hats. Bright
colored woven straps have come out along with the traditional basket
straw. Sneakers in sailcloth and lieavv denim in various colors match
summer sun * unfits.
In the light weight throwover sun coats, dusters are ornamented with
big patches oi straw, often basket weave, which stand out at the hipline.
