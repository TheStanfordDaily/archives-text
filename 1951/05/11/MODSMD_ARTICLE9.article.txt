Going up? Going down?
It'll be one way or the other for
Stanford's baseballers as they hop
' on the CIBA elevator this weekend.
] Today it's Cal at Berkeley, and
tomorrow at 1:15 it's UCLA here in
a twin bill. All three games will
go toward answering just two ques
; tions—will use or UCLA win the
; crown this year, and how far be
low this Southland pair will the
Cards land?
USC Ahead
As of now USC leads the pack
with UCLA one and a half games
behind. Stanford and Cal are tied
for third, and Santa Clara is dead
last.
Coach Dean, now that it's obvious
that the Cards aren't going too far
up or down, ha:; decided to shift his
j lineup with an eye to next year.
Agar Cleans Up
Bruce Cameron will continue to
lead off. but Dick Clegg, a good
hit-and-run man, will move up to
j the second spot. Jack Shepard, the
squad's most consistent hitter, takes
j over the number three position, and
Jim Agar replaces Jack in the
j clean-up post.
Tom Shaw, playing third, will hat
fifth, and in turn will be followed
| by Jim Castagnoli, Dick Corzine,
and Art Abrahamson.
Hog Osenbaugh will hurl for the
Cards against Cal and in all proba
bility will face his old enemy, Bill
Nishita, craftiest pitcher in the cir
cuit. Joe Chez and Bob Murphy
[ will work the UCLA games.
Bruins in the Race
Coach Art Reichle's Bruins are in
the thick of the CIBA race for the
first time since 1944 when they won
their first and only championship.
! Leading the UCLAans is shortstop
Ted Nai'leski, who's hitting .441.
Teammate Buddy Bachtelle is third
in CIBA hitting with .351, and first
baseman John Matulich is currently
rapping at a ,314 clip.
But the strong point in the Bruin
attack is their pitching trio of Bob
MrNcil. Warren Hart, and Hay
J O'Connor, who have tossed six vic
: tories between them. McNeil deci
sioncd the Cards the last time out
while TTart lost a close one in Los
Angeles in a game abbreviated by
j rain.

Going up? Going down?
It'll be one way or the other for
Stanford's baseballers as they hop
' on the CIBA elevator this weekend.
] Today it's Cal at Berkeley, and
tomorrow at 1:15 it's UCLA here in
a twin bill. All three games will
go toward answering just two ques
; tions—will use or UCLA win the
; crown this year, and how far be
low this Southland pair will the
Cards land?
USC Ahead
As of now USC leads the pack
with UCLA one and a half games
behind. Stanford and Cal are tied
for third, and Santa Clara is dead
last.
Coach Dean, now that it's obvious
that the Cards aren't going too far
up or down, ha:; decided to shift his
j lineup with an eye to next year.
Agar Cleans Up
Bruce Cameron will continue to
lead off. but Dick Clegg, a good
hit-and-run man, will move up to
j the second spot. Jack Shepard, the
squad's most consistent hitter, takes
j over the number three position, and
Jim Agar replaces Jack in the
j clean-up post.
Tom Shaw, playing third, will hat
fifth, and in turn will be followed
| by Jim Castagnoli, Dick Corzine,
and Art Abrahamson.
Hog Osenbaugh will hurl for the
Cards against Cal and in all proba
bility will face his old enemy, Bill
Nishita, craftiest pitcher in the cir
cuit. Joe Chez and Bob Murphy
[ will work the UCLA games.
Bruins in the Race
Coach Art Reichle's Bruins are in
the thick of the CIBA race for the
first time since 1944 when they won
their first and only championship.
! Leading the UCLAans is shortstop
Ted Nai'leski, who's hitting .441.
Teammate Buddy Bachtelle is third
in CIBA hitting with .351, and first
baseman John Matulich is currently
rapping at a ,314 clip.
But the strong point in the Bruin
attack is their pitching trio of Bob
MrNcil. Warren Hart, and Hay
J O'Connor, who have tossed six vic
: tories between them. McNeil deci
sioncd the Cards the last time out
while TTart lost a close one in Los
Angeles in a game abbreviated by
j rain.
