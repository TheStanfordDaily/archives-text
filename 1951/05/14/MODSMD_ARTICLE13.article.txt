Stanford's newly - suspended
Chaparral went through the j
mails "as usual" last weekend, i
minus any complaints that it j
should not.
Palo Alto head Postmaster Ralph
Evans sairl last night that he has
"never received any complaints" fo
the effect that the humor magazine ,
should be banned from the mails
through violation of Post Office regu- j
lations.
The Chappie was "suspended in- |
definitely" last Thursday afternoon
by Dean of Students 11. Donald Win
bigler and the Faculty Committee on j
Student Affairs. It was not revealed
when the magazine mght allowed j
to resume publication.
Immediately following a routinr j
Men's Council meeting last Friday I
night. Chairman Dick Clegg called a j
sprcial council meeting for tonight, j
It was expected the council will "re- j
| view" the suspension, hut that it
would not attempt to go against thr>
Dean's decision, which is final.
(Ac tually, the Dean's office is the |
j court of highest appeals as regards i
j Honor Code and Fundamental
! Standard violations. Students j
brought before Men's and Women's |
i Councils may appeal their eases for
! final judgment to the Dean.)
Men's Council member Jim Scott
I said last night that the council would
meet to discuss a possible revision of
j the Fundamental Standard to in
| elude a "code of ethics" for campus
| publications, plays, dances, and other
i events.
It was expected that such a "code
j of ethics" could be used as a basis for
future trials by student judiciary
: groups. Mislead of by the Faculty
i CojnmiUoc on Student Affairs.
In commenting on tho Chappie
suspension, Dean of Students Win
bigler said last Friday night he had
received no complaints to the effect
| that the ban was "out of order."
The Dean said he would recom
! mend a study by student groups of a
revsion of the Fundamental Stand
j ard to include such a "code of ethics."
He indicated he would like to see
I "students do their own censoring" in
I the future.
