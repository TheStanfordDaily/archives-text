# Baseballers Knock Bears, Split With UCLA's Bruins
## 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Home runs proved to be the deciding factor in all three games
as Stanford's baseball team dumped Cal Friday, 10 to 3, and split
Saturday's double-header with UCLA, dropping the opener, 9 to 8,
and taking the nightcap, 3 to 2.
Jn Friday's game, Stanford moved into an early, 2 to 0, lead with

single tallies in the first and third
frames. However, the Cards' start
ing hurler, Roger Osenbaugh, stayed
in hot water by issuing seven walks
in the first four innings. The Stan
ford infield kept the Bears from
i reaching home plato with double
plays in each of the first four stan-
I zas.
In the sixth inning the Bears capi
[ tali zed on three walks, a pair of
| Stanford, errors, and leftfielder Cas
J Munoz's third base hit to forge ahead,
I 3 to 2.
Cor/.ine Homes
With one out in the top of the sev-
I cnth inning Card catcher Dick C'or
zine stepped into one of Bill Nishita's
offerings and sent it screaming over
the infield. By the time the Bear
: outfield had retrieved the ball in
I deep field, Corzine was rounding
| third on his way home with the tying
run.
After two were out in the eighth.
Tom Shaw singled for Stanford, and
Dave Rosenkrantz went in run for
him. Jim Castagnoli followed with
! another four-master into left field to
put the Cards on top, 5 to .3.
Cal mentor Clint Evans gambled
by lifting his ace hurler, Nishita. for
a pinch hitter in the bottom of the
eighth. However, his strategy failed
to pay off, as Jim Claypool, who went
Jin to relieve Osenbaugh in the sev
cnth kept the Bear attack under
I control.

Five in the Ninth
Stanford picked up it»s five remain
ing runs in the top of the ninth off
two Cal relief chuckers, submarine
tosscr Bucky Cowan and Al Ma
thews.
In Saturday's opening game at the
Sunken Diamond, Stanford moved
into an early 5 to 0 load at the end
of two frames. The Bruins closed the
gap to 5 to 3 in the third and one in
the sixth with two runs in the third
and one in the sixth. However,
Stanford came hack with throe runs
in their half of the sixth to widen
♦he margin to 8 to 3.
In the Bruin half of the seventh,
Stanford's starting pitcher Bob Mur
phy gave up his eleventh,'twelfth,
and thirteenth walks. With two out,
the runners were all going as Uclan
third sncker Buddy Bachtelle popped
a high fly ball into short center field,
Indian shortstop Bruce Cameron
misjudged the hall and it fell for a
two-base hit, with two runs coming
across. Murphy's next pitch was
wild, allowing another run to .score,
and Coach Everett Dean signaled to
the hull pen for Jim Claypool to
come in for the second time in as
many days. However, Claypool
a single to Ted Narleski and a triple
to John Matulich to gve the Bruins
five runs in the inning and an 8 to 8
tie I all game.
Claypool Shuts Out Bruins
Hay O'Connor, who had gonr- nine
innings against Santa Clara the day
before, came in to shut the door on
the Indians, as Claypool chut out the
Bruins in the eighth and ninth in
nings.
After two were out in the UCLA
half of the tenth inning, substitute
rightfirldcr George Hunter sent a
fly ball over Dick Clegg's head in
.center field that was good for the
circuit, and gav the Bruins a 9 to 8
bulge, whit li was all they needed
as O'Connor sent three Indian hat
ters down in a row after walking
Cast ignoli.
In Saturday's finale Stanford one
again moved into an early lead with
single runs in the first and third in
tiings. However, the Bruins knotted
the count at 2-all with run in the
fourth and the fifth.
Cnmcrr.n Breaks Slump
In the Stanford half of the fifth
Bruce Cameron broke his prolonged
hatting slump by leading off with a
b 1««t over the left field fence at the
360-foot mark. In so doing, Cameron
became the fir t colloce ball player to
hit two home runs out of ihe Sunken
Diamond in regulation games. His
previous four-master was a bases
loaded affair against USF last season
The 3 to 2 load was all that Joe
Cher needed to chalk up his third
CIBA win of the season as he put
the Bruins down in order in the sixth
and seventh frames.

third sncker Buddy Bachtelle popped
a high fly ball into short center field,
Indian shortstop Bruce Cameron
misjudged the hall and it fell for a
two-base hit, with two runs coming
across. Murphy's next pitch was
wild, allowing another run to .score,

After two were out in the UCLA
half of the tenth inning, substitute
rightfirldcr George Hunter sent a

hit two home runs out of ihe Sunken
Diamond in regulation games. His
previous four-master was a bases
loaded affair against USF last season
The 3 to 2 load was all that Joe
Cher needed to chalk up his third
CIBA win of the season as he put
the Bruins down in order in the sixth
and seventh frames.

Saturday's double-header with UCLA, dropping the opener, 9 to 8,
and taking the nightcap, 3 to 2.
Jn Friday's game, Stanford moved into an early, 2 to 0, lead with

single tallies in the first and third
frames. However, the Cards' start
ing hurler, Roger Osenbaugh, stayed
in hot water by issuing seven walks
in the first four innings. The Stan
ford infield kept the Bears from
i reaching home plato with double
plays in each of the first four stan-
I zas.
In the sixth inning the Bears capi
[ tali zed on three walks, a pair of
| Stanford, errors, and leftfielder Cas
J Munoz's third base hit to forge ahead,
I 3 to 2.
Cor/.ine Homes
With one out in the top of the sev-
I cnth inning Card catcher Dick C'or
zine stepped into one of Bill Nishita's
offerings and sent it screaming over
the infield. By the time the Bear
: outfield had retrieved the ball in
I deep field, Corzine was rounding
| third on his way home with the tying
run.
After two were out in the eighth.
Tom Shaw singled for Stanford, and
Dave Rosenkrantz went in run for
him. Jim Castagnoli followed with
! another four-master into left field to
put the Cards on top, 5 to .3.
Cal mentor Clint Evans gambled
by lifting his ace hurler, Nishita. for
a pinch hitter in the bottom of the
eighth. However, his strategy failed
to pay off, as Jim Claypool, who went
Jin to relieve Osenbaugh in the sev
cnth kept the Bear attack under
I control.

Five in the Ninth

ing runs in the top of the ninth off
two Cal relief chuckers, submarine
tosscr Bucky Cowan and Al Ma
thews.
In Saturday's opening game at the
Sunken Diamond, Stanford moved
into an early 5 to 0 load at the end
of two frames. The Bruins closed the
gap to 5 to 3 in the third and one in
the sixth with two runs in the third
and one in the sixth. However,
Stanford came hack with throe runs
in their half of the sixth to widen
♦he margin to 8 to 3.
In the Bruin half of the seventh,
Stanford's starting pitcher Bob Mur
phy gave up his eleventh,'twelfth,
and thirteenth walks. With two out,
the runners were all going as Uclan
third sncker Buddy Bachtelle popped
a high fly ball into short center field,
Indian shortstop Bruce Cameron
misjudged the hall and it fell for a
two-base hit, with two runs coming
across. Murphy's next pitch was
wild, allowing another run to .score,
and Coach Everett Dean signaled to
the hull pen for Jim Claypool to
come in for the second time in as
many days. However, Claypool
a single to Ted Narleski and a triple
to John Matulich to gve the Bruins
five runs in the inning and an 8 to 8

before, came in to shut the door on
the Indians, as Claypool chut out the
Bruins in the eighth and ninth in
nings.
After two were out in the UCLA
half of the tenth inning, substitute
rightfirldcr George Hunter sent a
fly ball over Dick Clegg's head in

circuit, and gav the Bruins a 9 to 8
bulge, whit li was all they needed
as O'Connor sent three Indian hat
ters down in a row after walking
Cast ignoli.
In Saturday's finale Stanford one
again moved into an early lead with
single runs in the first and third in
tiings. However, the Bruins knotted

Cnmcrr.n Breaks Slump
In the Stanford half of the fifth
Bruce Cameron broke his prolonged
hatting slump by leading off with a
b 1««t over the left field fence at the
360-foot mark. In so doing, Cameron
became the fir t colloce ball player to
hit two home runs out of ihe Sunken
Diamond in regulation games. His
previous four-master was a bases
loaded affair against USF last season
The 3 to 2 load was all that Joe
Cher needed to chalk up his third
CIBA win of the season as he put
the Bruins down in order in the sixth
and seventh frames.
