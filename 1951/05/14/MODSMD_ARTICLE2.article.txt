tion just because some prices may
conic down slightly. Even though

officials have persuaded a large bloc
of the nation's leading business men
not to support President Truman's
request for stronger wage - price
controls.
Sen. Robert A. Taft (R.. O.) said
today the entire stabilization pro
gram "may be scuttled" if the same
board has authority to fix wage
ceilings and to settle wage contract
