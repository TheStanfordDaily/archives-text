# The 						Chappie Suspension
## 
### 
Last Thursday, Dean of Students H. Donald
WinElgTer' suspended the Stanford Chaparral
indefinitely. After talking with him, the Chap
pie editoj, -and others, we are inclined to agree
wijjh the action that was taken.
H we can, we would like to clarify the reasons
for; the-ban.
Let's start out by saying that the Dean did
MOST act without provocation. To many of us
(including our parents, our alumni, and our fac
ulty), the double meanings involving sexual
intercourse were all too obvious. The Dean was
besieged by phone calls, office calls, and let
ters -mosT ol them demanding some sort of
action.
Few censors in the United States would've
accepted the magazine as being within the lim
its of good taste. Tous.it was not. That usually
indefinable line between good humor and bad
humor was crossed; for once in our lives we
knew what it meant to be on the wrong side of
the line, even if we weren't too sure what it was
like to be on the right side.
Let's face it: we knew that parts of the
Chappie could be and were taken by readers
ot all ages to mean something filthy. For
many of us, the May Chappie v/asn't some
thing we'd like our parents to see.
Two years ago, Dean Lawrence Kimpton
stood over the student body. That year, 1949,
when the comics issue had crossed his desk
and he'd heard the gripes of those same par
ents, alums, and faculty members, the Dean
v/arned the editors.
Last year, just before Crash Comics, '50, hit
the newstands, he warned them again, and the
editors took proofs of their comic strips to the
Dean and Director of Information Fred Glover.
There they were "censored" — if you define
"censoring" as the cutting out of filth.
This year, a few weeks before the comics
went to press, Chappie's editors were compli
mented by the Administration for doing such a
good job in previous issues of the school year.
No warning was felt necessary, and as a result,
there were no proofs submitted —at least none
of those cornic strips that later proved so objec
tionable.
Maybe that's why the Chaparral was
banned last Thursday—after a culmination of
sporadic warnings that lasted over a period
of two years.
Something; Else . . .
Something we didn't know until a day later
was the fact that the Dean DID consult with
Men's Council Chairman Dick Clegg before or
dering the ban.
At the time, Clegg told the Dean that the
Council for Student Control — which theoreti
cally judges all violations of the Fundamental
Standard — "lacked background" to handle
such a case. Never before had the students
been called upon to pass judgment on a campus
publication, even though it was charged with
violating the Standard. Editors and their publi
cations had been suspended in the past —but
action had always come from the President's
office or the Dean's office.
In truth, Men's Council v/asn't ready. The
Council had—and has—no criteria upon which
to judge such a case. The Fundamental Stand

ard itself sets down no "sanity code" for cam
pus publications; it speaks only in the most
general terms —telling us not to drink liquor on
campus, and not to conduct ourselves in a man
ner unbecoming to the University.
Still, Men's and Women's Councils shculd've
been the bodies of original jurisdiction in the
Chappie case. If the University is going to give
the Chaparral, the Daily, the Quad, and the
fraternities as much "responsibility" as it pur
ports to give, then it should've been up to the
students to censor themselves.
As the Dean himself told the San Francisco
News last Friday:
. . the kids are on their own. That's the
way it's always been at Stanford. That's the
way they want it, and that's the way we want
it. If they are mature enough to put out a
humor magazine, then they should he mature
enough to see that it's right."
Two Things . . .
Two things, we feel, can be learned from the
suspension.
The first, and most important, is the realiza
tion that our Fundamental Standard—of which
we are so proud—is sadly incomplete. Tonight
Men's Council will meet to "review" Chappie's
suspension. Out of the meeting, it is expected,
will come some concrete suggestions whereby
the Fundamental Standard may be so revamped
as to include standards of judging newspapers,
magazines, plays, and movies on campus.
By this, we don't mean editoiial censorship.
Certainly we are free to believe what we
please. What we most emphatically do mean
is some sort of censonship against matters
that are clearly in bad taste.
The second thing we can learn from the
Chappie suspension is the fact that—even when
a "sanity code" is set down—the line between
good humor and bad will still be a relatively
indefinable, intangible one.
In the future, in other words, writers may
again be tempted to go "hog wild" and tread
upon as thin ice as possible in order to "get
around" Men's and Women's Councils.
We have no infallible way of preventing this
except, of course, by suspension after suspen
sion. However, if each year could be kicked
off with a conference between the Chappie
staff and Fred Glover, it might help. Glover is
the man v/ho gets all the letters from irate par
ents and alums when a "touchy" Chappie hits
the mails. If anyone, he is Stanford's expert on
public reaction to printed matter. And his of
fice is always open to hand out free advice.
If the publication's writers—and editors
have a clear idea of JUST HOW FAR THEY
CAN GO. then there will be no excuse for an
issue that is out of bounds.
In Retrospect . . .
In retrospect, we can say we are truly sorry
the Administration had to ban Chappie. How
ever, we feel the ban won't last.
Because of the intelligent manner in which
Chappie s top dogs have taken their magazine's
suspension, and because of student govern
ment action that is sure to come, we look for
bigger and better Chappies in the future.
Another thing, hackneyed but true; you can
be funny without being dirty.
