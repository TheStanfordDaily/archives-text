# Spring Brings Out the Best In Movie Comedies and Comics

### ROY HEMMING GEORGE BUCKLEY 
It's not often these days that you .see natural screen
comedians whose entertainment ..s iri their individual
character and not in some gagster's typewriter.
'1 his week two such players are on view in the
Kay Area—Thelma Kitt< r in "The Mating Season"
(at the Park in Menlo) and Fernandel in ''Caught
in the Foreign Legion" (at the Rio in S.F.).
Miss Hitler has made only a few films to date, play
ing small roles, but has succeeded completely in steal
ing whole sequences from little Davi.s, Paul Doug
las, Linda Darnell, and other scene-stealing veterans.
In "The Mating Season" she takes over a leading role
and walks away with it as easily a- she has with the
: mailer ones. A.s a hamburger hasher whose son mar
ries into the Social Register, she makes her salty,
down-to-earth personality dominate any number of
comedy situatons which—without her—would have
revealed their essential contrivedness.
'I lie screen play is partly the work of Charles
Bracket! and although (his one wll not likely win
him awards like some of hi«> others ("Miss Tatlock's
Millions," "Sunset Boulevard"), it provides a thor
oughly entertaining framework in which to let Miss

Hitter hiose.
Lvery .so often Gene '1 ierncy, John Lund, or Miriam
Hopkins come up with a hilarious line including tln•
now-classic quip about the General who couldn't be
lelt alone with a French telephone—but if. the Kil
ter gal who sustains the fun.
Ihe integiation of her facial expressions with her
New York accent, plus the feeling she conveys of being
a genuine person, make her a very welcome figure on
the contemporary screen.
I*ernamlel. or "The Frenchman." as he i-, heller
known hy American audiences, starts you laughing
the second liK unique puss appears on the screen.
I he range of his purely visual comedy, while of a
diOercnt type from Miss Hitler's in ils unabashed
naievete. is as thoroughly eni'ivahle.
"Caught in the Foreign Legion" has some putty
lamiliar situation.-; yet that doesnt seem to matter
when Fernandel is involved i:s an unwilling s<il lier
ol-fortune being pursued by a prune-faced wife.
Its true, too, that he has made pictures which were
l unnier overall. But we doubt, he's ever done any
thing better than the train scenes at the 1 eginning;
il so, w« haven't seen it yet in America.
