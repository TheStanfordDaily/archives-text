# Band to Replace Movie Next Sunday Evening
## 
### 
Many persons think of a concert band as merely a poor man's
symphony orchestra. To them, band music is orchestral music
arranged for wind instrumentation, with clarinets replacing violins,
saxophones in place of 'cellos, and tubas replacing string basses.
That this idea is not always true will be proved Sunday night

, when the Stanford concert band
i presents its annual spring concert
in Memorial Auditorium. The ad
mission-free performance will start
at 8:15.
Included in the program are two
selections which show that much
serious music has been written ex
! elusively for bands.
Francis Joseph Gossec's 'Mili
tary Symphony in F" was one of
the earlie-t compositions written
exclusively lor bands. It was com
posed in 17H;J, at the time of the
Fi'en-h Revolution, when open air
concerts were beginning to gain
' popularity throughout Europe.
It consist; of three short move
ments of considerable musical
I charm.
Hector Berlioz's "Grand Sympho
i ny for Band" is probably the most
famous id ambiuous oi the ecm
j positions written for wind instru
; mentation only. The Apotheosis
(third movement) will be played
Sunday night by the Stanford Band.
The Grand Symphony was writ
ten in 3S'JO r I the lequesl of the
French government. It is signifi
i cant because it represents the flow
ering of a tradition of band music
for pubiic occasions, started mainly
by Gossee.
