# Stanford Golfers Lose in Tourney
## 
### 
It was a case of "close, but not
quite" for Stanford's John Elliott
Saturday, as the Stanford golfer lost
out in the finals of the PCC South
ern Division Golf Championships to
USC's Roger Dunn, 4 and 3.
Elliott was the hottest swinger in
the tourney until Saturday, when
he fell behind Dunn early in the
going and then never threatened.
Elliott had reached the finals by
knocking off teammate Jack Kno
sher, one-up in 20 holes.
Dick McElyca of Stanford, de
fending champion, was eliminated
in the first round by Cal's Con
I3runk.
Stanford lost the team champion
ship Thursday, as USC took the
honors with an aggressive 616. Stan
ford had 624.
The defeat suffered by the Card
golfers will probably not influence
their expected invitation to the NC
AA tourney in June. Stanford had
a perfect record in dual-meet play.
