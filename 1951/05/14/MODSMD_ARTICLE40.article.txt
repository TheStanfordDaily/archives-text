### 
Stanford's tennis team ran its
winning streak to two matches in
a row Friday afternoon, squeaking
past USF 5 to 4 on the Dons' courts.
The Indians won four out of the
six singles matches, then hung on
for one doubles victory and the
team win.
Hardest fought wins for the In
dians were in the third and fourth
singles. In the third singles, Tom
Lewyn had Wally Vickery at match
point 13 times before coming
through for a 6-2, 12-10 triumph.
Bob Sibert, Card fourth singles
man, went three long sets before
he wore down Debroe of the Duns
7-9. 7-5, 6-1.
In the headline first singles,
George Gentry of the Cards went
down to defeat G-3, 3-6. 6-4 before
the strokes of Seth Peicrson, No. 1
man for USF.
Charlie Hickox scored the third
Indian point, solving the game of
Stan Smith for a 5-7. 6-2, 6-1 win.
In the remaining singles matches,
Vince Schmiejder lost to Carver 7-5,
6-3 in the the fifth slot, and Dean
Brinkman won the sixth singles for
the Cards by beating Marchi 6-2,
6-3.
Schmieder, however, then came
back with Phil Neilsen to clinch the
team victory for Stanford in the
third doubles by defeating Marchi
and Carver 6-3, 6-2.
It was well this pair came
through, for Hickox and Lewyn
were soundly trounced by Vickery
and Debroe in the second doubles
6-0. 6-2; and Gentry and Sibert
lost a three-set struggle to the Don
first doubles pair of Peterson and
Smith by the scores of 6-2, 5-7, 6-3.
