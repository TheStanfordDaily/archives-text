## Card Crew Finishes Third In Washington Regatta 
### DICK KLEIN 
A Washington sweep of their own regatta on Saturday swept
Stanford's hopes for an upset right off Lake Washington snd gave
the Huskies the Coast rowing title. The Huskies took all three
races—the varsity, jayvee, and frosh. Stanford's two shells were
good thirds behind the Cal Bears.
The Huskies, forgetting the constant barrage of pessimism from

their peerless Coach Al Ulbrickson,
dominated the entire regatta with
amazing ease to the delight of an es
timated 100,000 hometown spectators.
It was the first varsity win over Cal
on the Lake Washington waters sincc
1942.
Not entirely satisfied with
his racers' showings, Ulbrickson
commented, '"We'll have to spruce
lip a lot before we'll be ready for
national com petition." But rowing
experts were quick to reply that
Washington was heading for an
other banner year, ami could re
peat their sweep'of lasi year's Na
tionals at Marietta.

For Stanford, the good Papoose !
shell made the best showing. The'
frosh led until the halfway point in j
; their two-mile race. Then the little j
j Huskies took command. But the j
1 fiosh held on well and kept ahead of ]
! their Bear rivals until a mile and a i
| half of rough water had been rowed. ]
In the varsity competition, Stan- i

ford was left at the start and had
trouble keeping pace with Cal
through the early stages of the long
course. Washington shot off to a
substantial lead and held easily until
the Bears made a strong bid over the
last three-quarters of a mile.
The Indians finished two lengths
behind the Rears arid a total of a
little shy of fcur open - lioat
lengths behind the winning Hus
kies. 'limes were not exceptional
for the 2 3-4 miles, as a heavy wind
made rowing far from ideal. Wash
ington's time was 15:38.8, and the
Cards were clocked at 15:55.
Coach Jim Beggs, seeing some im-

provment, said, "This was the best
race Stanford has ever ro\Ved. Last
month at Newport, Cal beat us by 15
seconds over a 2000-meter course.
Today Cal only defeated us by 8 sec
onds over a course about twice as
i long."

A Washington sweep of their own regatta on Saturday swept
Stanford's hopes for an upset right off Lake Washington snd gave
the Huskies the Coast rowing title. The Huskies took all three
races—the varsity, jayvee, and frosh. Stanford's two shells were
good thirds behind the Cal Bears.
The Huskies, forgetting the constant barrage of pessimism from

their peerless Coach Al Ulbrickson,
dominated the entire regatta with
amazing ease to the delight of an es
timated 100,000 hometown spectators.
It was the first varsity win over Cal
on the Lake Washington waters sincc
1942.
Not entirely satisfied with
his racers' showings, Ulbrickson
commented, '"We'll have to spruce
lip a lot before we'll be ready for
national com petition." But rowing
experts were quick to reply that
