# Kerkorian, Hugasian Scamper As Reds Cop Final Scrimmage
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Gary Kerkorian was at his ver
satile best and Harry Hugasian was
the hipster of old as the Reds
romped to a 28 to 0 triumph over
the Whites last Saturday in Stan
ford's final spring scrimmage.
For the first time this year, the
coaching stall broke its air of pessi
mism and said that the team showed
something. Joe Ruetz said, "They
.showed a lot ol improvement, espe
cially in blocking. Jack Bonetti was
a demon out there. I also like Car
ter Pyle, John Broderick, A 1 Kirk
land, Ted Tanner, Bob Griffin, John
Steinberg, Dick Horn, Bob Latham,
Tsar Calfee, and of course Hugasian
and Kerkorian."
The referees' red finery and sev
eral fumbles kept the scoring down
in the first half until the Reds broke
the ice near the end of the second
quarter.
Kerkorian Pilot
Kerkorian, who had been playing
defense, stepped in to pilot the Reds
(o a 99-yard scoring drive. High

lighting the drive was a 37-yard
! snakehipped run by Hugasian and a
30-yard screen pass play from Ker
| korian to Kirkland. Bob Meyers
punched the final two yards for the
I score.
Meyers' return of the kickoff pro
i duced the freak play of the game.
He received on the 10, followed his
I interference nicely, and went into a
maze of players on the 28. He broke
| out of the maze, into the clear when
suddenly he discovered he didn't
i have the ball. No harm was done
! since teammate Dave Worley had
| possession of it.
Latham Scores
Latham, a 212-pound tackle, ac
complished the lineman's dream as
lie picked off a Dick Horn pass and
sped like a halfback 31 yards to the
! goal. Kerk converted out of Huga
j sian's hold to make it 14 to 0.
The Reds increased their advan
tage to 21 to 0 with eight minutes
J to go in the fourth quarter.
The Reds tacked up their final
1 score as frosh half Bill Schiedecker

fell on a loose fumble on the
Whites' 3. The Whites got stubborn
and three cracks at the line netted a
loss of two yards. Then quarter
back Jack Bickel raced back on a
bootleg, spotted Kirkland all by his
lonesome in the end zone, and
without even looking back hit him
with a perfect strike. It resembled
a hook shot in basketball.
