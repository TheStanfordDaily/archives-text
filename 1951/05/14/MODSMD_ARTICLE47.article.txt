### 
Ed Tuckcr, Stanford's representa
tive in the ninth annual Tourna
ment of Orators held at USF last
Friday, was rated a second place by
one judge, but a ninth by anotherâ€”
j a vote putting him below the top
J four contestants in the final tabula
j tions.
i The winner was Curtis Mayer, a
displaced person from the College
i of the Pacific. This is Mayer's first
! win after four years of competition
! in the tournament.
In choosing the winners there was
| wide diversity of opinion among the
judges. As it turned out, the win
ner was a contestant who received
three votes for fourth place.
Dr. Leland Chapin, Stanford
speech and drama professor, said
afterward: "We should be proud of
Ed. He did a remarkable, creditable
job for Stanford."
