About 200 K a 'ly costumed folk
dancers from San Mateo and Santa |
Clara counties enjoyed a varied !
program of dances in the Regional J
Festival hosted by the Stanford
Hoedowners yesterday afternoon in
the Basketball Pavilion.
The program, emceed by Bill j
Grishaw, included dances from the
British Isles, Germany, Scandinavia, j
the Slavic countries, and the more i
familiar American square and round
dances.
This Sunday marked the first
time that a regional festival, includ- I
ing groups from neighboring coun- J
ties, has been held on the campus, j
Many Palo Altans and Stanford j
students filled the galleries to watch
the dancers. Ed Carpenter, one of J
the "original" Hoedowners, and Bill
Grishaw called squares.
