# FIRST PUBLIC VIEW IN FIVE YEARS
## Museum To Open Doors Tomorrow 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Tomorrow and Wednesday,
for the first time in five years,
the "Museum Closed" sign on
the door of the big, buff-colored
Leland Stanford Junior Museum
will not be true.
Between 10 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,
students, faculty, and other inter
ested persons will be able to wan
der through the exhibits collected
from all over the world, to sec
Egyptian vases 30 centuries old and
ornate Persian metal helmets.
The two-day opening is a trial to
determine the extent of Stanford
interest in the building's displays.
It is an Excom project directed by
Phil Saeta and begun last fall after
Excom toured the museum and de
cided to seek proof for its belief that
there was a real demand for open
ing the institution.
Mummies to Funeral Barks
Contained in the museum are ev
erything from mummies and carved
wooden Egyptian funeral barks to
Senator's Stanford's first locomo
tive. "The great majority of it was
collected by Mrs. Stanford," Mrs.
Robert Cross, museum and Art Gal
lery director, explained.
"It was her toy, her private hob
by," Mrs. Cross added.
During Mrs. Stanford's lifetime
she gathered the more memorable
family possessions, items collected
by Leland Jr., and historic and an
thropological exhibits for display in
the building the senator had built
for her.
Although most of the Stanford
iana — including Mrs. Stanford's
gowns—is not yet ready for dis
play, a portion of it is on exhibit in
the main lobby and the Railroad
Room. Each item has behind il a
chapter in the Stanford story.
Stanford History Romantic
Mrs. Cross, whose father was on
the University's first faculty, knows
each one of these chapters and re
late:, with enthusiasm the back
ground for each display. "I'm a
missionary for all this. I think Stan
ford has the most romantic history
of any university in the world," lie
said.
Entering the big black and wl>il<•
marble lobby, the first di play ea:.e
on the left contains some of Mr:-.
Stanford's private possession ;. There
arc feathery fans, an ornate gold
clock which was part of the Tiffany
exhibit al the Philadelphia Centen
nial in 1870, and a few jewels.
But, the jewels are paste. Mr-.
Stanford wore them just after her
husband's death, when all hi:
wealth was tied up in law suits and
•dir had to sell her real gem to buy
books for the University library.
Hard Times for All
This was a of hardship for
all connected with the school, Mr::.
Cross explained. Money for facull.v
salaries was scanty, so the profes
sors were paid not according to
rank but in proportion to the size
of their families.
In the center of the marble en
try way stands a huge black metal
statue of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford and
Leland. Once it stood in Memorial
Court, where it was the object of
rival schools' attacks.
A ease marked "10th Century

Toys" contains some of Leland Jr.'s
playthings, typical of the time. And
in the Railroad Room is the Gover
nor Stanford, "first locomotive pur
chased for the Central Pacific,
shipped to Califronia via Cape Horn
in 18(53," as well as a replica of the
golden spike which joined Ameri
ca's first transcontinental railroad.
Egyptian Room
Also on the first floor are the
Egyptian and Japanese Rooms. The
former has ancient vases, tomb fig
urines, and two mummies; the lat
ter, everything from exotic screens
to a Buddha altar.
Up the marble stairs are the an
thropological exhibits. A native
kayak is hung on the fall of the
South Sea Islands Room. Califor
nia's early Indian history is illus
trated in a series of displays, many
of them from the Palo Alto area.
Keeping all these displays open
to the public has been a problem
ever since the 1906 earthquake. Be
fore that the museum formed a
whole quadrangle; then the quake
leveled two wings and destroyed
many of the exhibits.
M rs. Stanford Dies
Fortunately, Mrs. Stanford was
not alive to see this, Mrs. Cross
mused. "She was determined to see
the physical plant of the University
completed. She died six months be
fore the earthquake."
In ID4G the building was closed
for inventory and reclassification.
Since then only art .and anthropol
ogy classes have been allowed in
side. There are seniors graduating
this year who have never had a
chance to enter the building. Excom
representative Saeta pointed out.
A huge amount of dusting, clean
ing, and marking has been neces
sary to ready the museum for this
week's opening. The work has been
done under the Art Department,
headed by Dr. Raymond Faulkner.
