# BULL SESSION
## 
### VIC PALMIERI 
The other night I received a call front John Moore,
director of the Spring Show. I was much honored by
his cajl, because, for one thing, I do not often receive
calls from diiectors (except from the director of the

dining hall where 1 hash, who call:
.seven to tell me I'm late for work).
But; more than that, John in
quired if 1 could be present in the
Mem Aud that night for what he
called' the "technical rehearsal" of
the Spring Show. Naturally, I as
sumed by this that he meant to
draw * upon my vast technical
knowledge of the theater for ad
vice and criticism, so I quickly
consented:

(When I told my girl she snickered. "Listen, stu
pid," she said, "they just want you there because they
knowiyou'll laugh at anything." Dumb broad.)
At any rate, I went that night, feeling, I must admit,
jufct a little iike George Sanders. And later that night
I left," feeling, I must admit, just a little. Let me tell
you why.
Now I assume you have never seen a "technical
rehearsal" before. Because, like the duck-billed
platypus and the Chappie, the technical rehearsal
is a very rare animal. But, first of all. there are a
number of basic principles—underlying assumptions,
as our erudite friends of the faculty so love to put
it—mi which the whole thing is founded.
In the first place, it is assumed that technical matters
such us lighting, stage effects, properties, etc., will be
finally worked out. This is only wishful thinking, of
coursfe. When I came in,, for instance, Rock Campbell
and l4tlty Benson, stars of the show, were just leading
into ajvery tender embrace.
Thd scene was enough to make sparks jump from
anybody's hair, but when Campbell finally kissed her
and every light in the house went out, I was im
pressed. (Yesterday I changed my 'major to speech
and drama.)
In the second place, there are a number of general
rules that govern the conduct of everyone in the Mem
Aud on "tech night." Rule No. 1 is that everyone is
indignant. Director John Moore is indignant with the
cast, and the cast is indignant with Director John
Moore, Co-author Wally While is indignant with Mu
sical Director Bill Barnes, and Musical Director Bill
Barrtefe is indignant with the orchestra. The orchestra,
of course, is just generally indignant, because they
have to sit there and play when they could be out on
the tawn.
Buit the most indignant one of all is a tubby little
character who by the looks <»r his clothes I took to be
the Itical chimney sweep but who turns out to be the
"prop man" (actually, anyone over there will tell
you that a prop man has to be grubby to be good.
In fait I gather it's supposed to lie bad luck if any one
of thit stage, crew turns up clean (luring rehearsals).
T *

Why this little man was so indignant I couldn't dis
cover, but every time the curtain went up he would
take one look at the stage and cry out tragically, "I'll
be damned!" and then rush backstage in mild hysteria, i
Which brings us to Rules Nos. 2 and 3: Everyone
must shout at the top of their lungs whenever they
wish to express themselves to anyone, even the person
right by their side, and they must run full ti!t when- |
ever they wish to get from one place to another.
Can you picture the scene? The rehearsal is about j
to begin. Moore, who is sitting far in the back of the
house (presumably to test the acoustics but actually to
be out of effective throwing range) stops arguing with 1
White long enough to shout for quiet. Immediately
everyone begins shouting for quiet.
Bill Barnes rushes madly for his baton and
screams for the orchestra. The orchestra rushes
madly for their instruments except for the second
fiddle player who shouts something obscene at
Barnes and continues making passes at a little girl
in ballet tights up in the balcony.
Finally one of Moore's aides comes running down
the aisle and screams for the curtain to go up. At this
point the noise dies a bit, so when the set comes into
view the prop man's inevitable "I'll be damned!"
sounds very significant. Now Sue Alter and George
Denny enter and commence to play a park bench ver- I
sion of a Lunt-Fontaine sofa scene, at which point
everyone begins running and shouting again.
The electricians holler at Moore from behind their
lights but Moore does not hear them because he has
just leaped out from the wings to adjust the attitudes I
of several of the chorus who have meanwhile wan- 1
dered out onto the stage.
Now they begin again. By this time While has
climbed on top of the piano and desperately attempts
to lead the thing himself while Barnes screams at
the drummer to speed up the beat and the drummcr
asks him what the hell lie thinks this is. a crew race? I
All the while Sue Alter is endeavoring to make her
self heard, but it is not worthwhile and she finally
gives up in favor of a group of dancers who begin to
trip blithely about the stage until suddenly someone
looks up from his script and shouts that this is not ;
their scene and what the hell are they doing on the
stage, and everyone begins running back and forth
across the stage and down the aisles and shouting at
the top of their lungs in the most indignant tones and
the lights go on and off and begin changing color and
Moore and White and Barnes begin yelling at each
other and the little prop man jumps up and down re- :
peatedly calling attention to the fact that he is damned
and a muffled scream from the balcony calls attention
to the fact that the second fiddle player is taking ad
vantage of the confusion and my girl looks up to
me and smiles sweetly and says, "Come, George Jean,
give them your views on the theater as an art form."

Barnes and continues making passes at a little girl

the aisle and screams for the curtain to go up. At this

everyone begins running and shouting again.

The other night I received a call front John Moore,
director of the Spring Show. I was much honored by
his cajl, because, for one thing, I do not often receive
calls from diiectors (except from the director of the

dining hall where 1 hash, who call:
.seven to tell me I'm late for work).
But; more than that, John in
quired if 1 could be present in the
Mem Aud that night for what he
called' the "technical rehearsal" of
the Spring Show. Naturally, I as
sumed by this that he meant to
draw * upon my vast technical
knowledge of the theater for ad
vice and criticism, so I quickly
consented:

(When I told my girl she snickered. "Listen, stu
pid," she said, "they just want you there because they
knowiyou'll laugh at anything." Dumb broad.)
At any rate, I went that night, feeling, I must admit,
jufct a little iike George Sanders. And later that night
I left," feeling, I must admit, just a little. Let me tell
you why.
Now I assume you have never seen a "technical
rehearsal" before. Because, like the duck-billed
platypus and the Chappie, the technical rehearsal
is a very rare animal. But, first of all. there are a
number of basic principles—underlying assumptions,
as our erudite friends of the faculty so love to put
it—mi which the whole thing is founded.
In the first place, it is assumed that technical matters
such us lighting, stage effects, properties, etc., will be
finally worked out. This is only wishful thinking, of
coursfe. When I came in,, for instance, Rock Campbell
and l4tlty Benson, stars of the show, were just leading
into ajvery tender embrace.
Thd scene was enough to make sparks jump from
anybody's hair, but when Campbell finally kissed her
and every light in the house went out, I was im
pressed. (Yesterday I changed my 'major to speech
and drama.)
In the second place, there are a number of general
rules that govern the conduct of everyone in the Mem
Aud on "tech night." Rule No. 1 is that everyone is
indignant. Director John Moore is indignant with the
cast, and the cast is indignant with Director John
Moore, Co-author Wally While is indignant with Mu
sical Director Bill Barnes, and Musical Director Bill
Barrtefe is indignant with the orchestra. The orchestra,
of course, is just generally indignant, because they
have to sit there and play when they could be out on
the tawn.
Buit the most indignant one of all is a tubby little
character who by the looks <»r his clothes I took to be
the Itical chimney sweep but who turns out to be the
"prop man" (actually, anyone over there will tell
you that a prop man has to be grubby to be good.
In fait I gather it's supposed to lie bad luck if any one
of thit stage, crew turns up clean (luring rehearsals).

director of the Spring Show. I was much honored by
his cajl, because, for one thing, I do not often receive
calls from diiectors (except from the director of the

dining hall where 1 hash, who call:
.seven to tell me I'm late for work).
But; more than that, John in
quired if 1 could be present in the
Mem Aud that night for what he
called' the "technical rehearsal" of
the Spring Show. Naturally, I as
sumed by this that he meant to
draw * upon my vast technical
knowledge of the theater for ad
vice and criticism, so I quickly
consented:

(When I told my girl she snickered. "Listen, stu
pid," she said, "they just want you there because they
knowiyou'll laugh at anything." Dumb broad.)
At any rate, I went that night, feeling, I must admit,
jufct a little iike George Sanders. And later that night
I left," feeling, I must admit, just a little. Let me tell
you why.
Now I assume you have never seen a "technical
rehearsal" before. Because, like the duck-billed
platypus and the Chappie, the technical rehearsal
is a very rare animal. But, first of all. there are a
number of basic principles—underlying assumptions,
as our erudite friends of the faculty so love to put
it—mi which the whole thing is founded.
In the first place, it is assumed that technical matters
such us lighting, stage effects, properties, etc., will be
finally worked out. This is only wishful thinking, of
coursfe. When I came in,, for instance, Rock Campbell
and l4tlty Benson, stars of the show, were just leading
into ajvery tender embrace.
Thd scene was enough to make sparks jump from
anybody's hair, but when Campbell finally kissed her
and every light in the house went out, I was im
pressed. (Yesterday I changed my 'major to speech
and drama.)
In the second place, there are a number of general
rules that govern the conduct of everyone in the Mem
Aud on "tech night." Rule No. 1 is that everyone is
indignant. Director John Moore is indignant with the
cast, and the cast is indignant with Director John
Moore, Co-author Wally While is indignant with Mu
sical Director Bill Barnes, and Musical Director Bill
Barrtefe is indignant with the orchestra. The orchestra,
of course, is just generally indignant, because they
have to sit there and play when they could be out on
the tawn.
Buit the most indignant one of all is a tubby little
character who by the looks <»r his clothes I took to be
the Itical chimney sweep but who turns out to be the
"prop man" (actually, anyone over there will tell
you that a prop man has to be grubby to be good.
In fait I gather it's supposed to lie bad luck if any one
of thit stage, crew turns up clean (luring rehearsals).
T *

Why this little man was so indignant I couldn't dis
cover, but every time the curtain went up he would
take one look at the stage and cry out tragically, "I'll
be damned!" and then rush backstage in mild hysteria, i
Which brings us to Rules Nos. 2 and 3: Everyone
must shout at the top of their lungs whenever they
wish to express themselves to anyone, even the person
right by their side, and they must run full ti!t when- |
ever they wish to get from one place to another.
Can you picture the scene? The rehearsal is about j
to begin. Moore, who is sitting far in the back of the
house (presumably to test the acoustics but actually to
be out of effective throwing range) stops arguing with 1
White long enough to shout for quiet. Immediately
everyone begins shouting for quiet.
Bill Barnes rushes madly for his baton and
screams for the orchestra. The orchestra rushes
madly for their instruments except for the second
fiddle player who shouts something obscene at
Barnes and continues making passes at a little girl
in ballet tights up in the balcony.
Finally one of Moore's aides comes running down
the aisle and screams for the curtain to go up. At this
point the noise dies a bit, so when the set comes into
view the prop man's inevitable "I'll be damned!"
sounds very significant. Now Sue Alter and George
Denny enter and commence to play a park bench ver- I
sion of a Lunt-Fontaine sofa scene, at which point
everyone begins running and shouting again.
The electricians holler at Moore from behind their
lights but Moore does not hear them because he has
just leaped out from the wings to adjust the attitudes I
of several of the chorus who have meanwhile wan- 1
dered out onto the stage.
Now they begin again. By this time While has
climbed on top of the piano and desperately attempts
to lead the thing himself while Barnes screams at
the drummer to speed up the beat and the drummcr
asks him what the hell lie thinks this is. a crew race? I
All the while Sue Alter is endeavoring to make her
self heard, but it is not worthwhile and she finally
gives up in favor of a group of dancers who begin to
trip blithely about the stage until suddenly someone
looks up from his script and shouts that this is not ;
their scene and what the hell are they doing on the
stage, and everyone begins running back and forth
across the stage and down the aisles and shouting at
the top of their lungs in the most indignant tones and
the lights go on and off and begin changing color and
Moore and White and Barnes begin yelling at each
other and the little prop man jumps up and down re- :
peatedly calling attention to the fact that he is damned
and a muffled scream from the balcony calls attention
to the fact that the second fiddle player is taking ad
vantage of the confusion and my girl looks up to
me and smiles sweetly and says, "Come, George Jean,
give them your views on the theater as an art form."
