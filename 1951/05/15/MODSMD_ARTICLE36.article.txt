# Individuality of 'Trio' Produces Refreshing and Different Film
## 
### ALJEAN LEVIN 
Thejmost remarkable thing about "Trio" is its indi
viduality. All the virtues —and a great many of the
faults?—of author Somerset Maugham's writing have
been Recaptured on celluloid, and form a refreshing
and different film. .
A hundred books and plays are made into films each
year, tmcl in their transformation from paper to cellu
loid strip ihey are cut, characters deleted, scenes ar
ranged for dramatic effect, and the author's philosophy
excluded.
As books are poked and pinched and fattened up by
screenwriters and photographers, acted by people who
do know what the author means, and di
rected by a man who sometimes does not care, they
usually have their individuality strained from them.
'Trio" has managed to avoid this straining process.
The three short stories which make up the film—
'•The Verier," "iVIr. Know-All," and "Sanatorium"
are slow-paced, unaccountably bitter in some spots,
and over-sentiniefrtal"irt others'. Yet these faults
seem to heighten the freshness of the picture.
"Trio" is a sequel to last year's "Quartet." It is also
a .success. Again we have separate stories tied together
only by a common author and. splendid acting.
"The Verger"—my favorite—is almost a long joke
about a man who losjea his job in a cathedral when
the new minister discovers .he can neither read nor
write. Instead of slipping into the back streets of Lon
don, the verger marries, opens a chain of tobacco shops,

and becomes a prosperous citzen. This incident is
padded and could easily have become an emabrrassing
sentimental whimsey. Instead it is splendidly acted
by James Hayter and splendidly human.
"Mr. Know-All" is the story of a boor, an arrogant
pest who makes himself the most hated man on a sea
cruise. Mr. Know-Ail (Nigel Patrick, is loud, tact
less, conceited—and a gentleman in the end. Spiced
with Maugham's wit, this story is quick and amusing,
and to most people the best of the three.
"Sanatorium," the weakest story, is double the
others in length. It deals with all the patients of a
tuberculosis sanatorium. Since one of the patients,
Ashendon who narrates the story, is actually
IYlaugham. the author is able to thrust his own point
of view at the audience.
Suffering to Maugham does not ennoble. His tuber
culosis patnients are spiteful old maids, quarrelsome
Scots, and a bitter husband who does not want to die.
The leading characters are the narrator. (Roland Cul
ver) and two young lovers (Jean Simmons and Mi
chael Rennie) who will die if they leave the sana
torium to marry.
The most outstanding thing about "Trio" is (lie su
perior acting in nearly every role. With the exception
of Jean Simmons and Roland Culver, I was not well
acquainted with the actors. 1 had not seen them as the
heros in a dozen Westerns or the heroines in a dozen
comedies; perhaps the freshness of their personalities
made me enjoy the acting so much.
