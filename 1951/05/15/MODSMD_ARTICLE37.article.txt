# CAMPUS OPINION
## The
						Standard and Chappie 
### 
To the Editor:
In the light of the present issue of the suspension of
the Chaparral, and the position taken by the Daily,
the Fundamental Standard Committee feels that it
.should attempt to shed some light on the problem by
presenting its policy in this regard.
The Standard has been criticized as "sadly incom
plete" because it does not prescribe a specific code of
ethics regulating student publications. It has also been
suggested that the Standard be revamped so as to in
clude a sort of "sanity code" of do's and don't's for
these publications.
The Committee does not feel thai such a code he
longs to the Standard; on the contrary, the strength
of the Standard lies in the very fact that it is not
codified. Km|ih«sis is placed rather on the responsi
bility of each individual to maintain within and
without the University such conduct as will reflect
only favorably upon Stanford.

The Committee does not feel that the Standard
should be made the scapegoat of every individual or
organization who want to see just how far they can
go. for instance, in violating rules of good taste in pub
lications. This is just what would happen if the Com
mittee undertook the unending task of establishing
rules and regulations to cover every instance of mis
behavior.
Where the Fundamental Standard hits been in
complete is in the fact that too few students are
aware of its existence and importance. To counter
act this, plans for next year are now underway t:»
strengthen the Standard in this respect through the
Fundamental Standard Committee.
In placing a great responsibility on each individual,
the University and student body have demonstrated
their confidence and faith in students to carry out this
responsibility. Only if students recognize, understand,
appreciate, and assume this responsibility will the
Fundamental Standard remain strong.
