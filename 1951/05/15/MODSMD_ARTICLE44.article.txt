# Foreign Students
## 
### 
Willard M. Waterous, foreign
students' adviser, would like to see
all foreign students interested in
taking full - time jobs during the |
summer.
The Immigration Service in San
Francisco requires requests for em- i
ployment before the students leave J
the University at the end of spring
quarter and before they begin any
employment.
Procedure for writing the re
quests is included in the informa
tion bulletin recently sent to all
foreign students from Mr. Water
ous' office.
