# Sunday Concert to Illustrate Versatility of Stanford Band
## 
### 
Sunday night's concert in Mem Aud by the Stanford Band will
illustrate a seasonal switch Director Julius Shuchat must contend
with each year.
For three months of football-every-Saturday, the band is a
marching outfit. The accent is on marching drills, and the music

is confined to marches and novelty
numbers for half-time stunts.
During winter and spring quar
ters, the band is changed into a eon
cert group, adding such instruments
us Mutes, oboes, and bassoons.
Instead of marches, the band
works on martial symphonies and
full-scale works written especially
for wind instrumentation. Another
change in policy allows women to
join the group. About 15 women
are members of the 105-pieee con
cert group.
One ol the numbers to be played
Sunday is a Haydn Wood compo
sition, "The Seal'aver." Wood de
scribes this number as a nautical
rhapsody on chanties. It is built up
on a number of famous old tunes
sung by sailors in the days when
sailing ships cruised the ocean.
Sunday's concert starts at 8:15
p.m. Admission is free.
