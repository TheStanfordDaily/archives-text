# PRO AND LARRY CAHN

### 
A few weeks hack Stanford's j
fencers did combat with a Uni
versity of California squad in the
Pavilion. It was a rainy after
noon. nothing to do, hut still there
was only a handful gathered to
watch the doings. Mostly parents
and friends.
By reading the sports pages we
had noted that Stanford has two ol j
the finest fencers in Northern Cali- I
iornia, namely Kit'hard Gross who '
is the tops, and Italph Amado who
ranks third. We were anxious to
see what they had, and in general
what fencing had.
We know nothing about fencing
except that it resembles dueling and
reminds one of something from
"Robin Hood" or "The Count of
Monte Cristo." Instead of swords, a j
thinner, longer weapon is used,
culled a foil. Our knowledge ends j
there. - â€¢
Coach Bugge was in the first row
and we sat next to him in hopes of j

picking up bits
o 1 information
an d knowledge
about the game.
But just as any
sport has its
technical points,
fencing is no ex
ception, and we
were on the out
side looking in.
Bugge was talk
ing in a foreign

language, but yet speaking it ex
citedly and nervously.
Fencing Like Boxing
Nevertheless a sport admirer will |
notice and appreciate the amazing
footwork and speed as the two com
batants attempt to "stab"' each oth
er, with blunted tips, and thereby
register points. The only tiling we
can compare fencing to is boxing,
because of the footwork, speed, and i
sudden thrusts. However, fencing
relies more on brains than brawn, j
Also the duelers are face to face on !
a long, thin mat and must remain |
on it; therefore there is no circling j
but only straight advance and re- i
treat.
Ama<!o, a Southpaw
Gross won his match easily, but
we were interested in Atnado, be
cause of his unorthodox left-handed
style. In all sports southpaws are j
the exception; so it is in fencing. |
Perhaps this inborn, but unusual,
style has accounted for much of
Ralph's success, though we doubt it
alter he finished showing us his
repertoire of sword tricks while de
feating his Berkeley Sherwood For
est opponent.
We learned something, got our
exciting moments, and enjoyed our
selves. Can't say as much for the
Card fencers, who despite Gross and
Amado, dropped the Big Duel to
California.
* * *
From the looks of the program
given out at Saturday's scrim
mage, we will have our work cut
out for us in learning the numer
ous new symbols used in identi
fying players' positions and expe
rience.
There were six symbols for vari
ous degrees of experience. JV and
FR we recognized as men up from
the junior varsity and frosh. With
a little imagination we figured a *
to mean a letterman. But TK. NF,
and NL forced us to refer to the
key at the program's bottom. We
were ashamed lor not guessing TR
stood for transfer, but were not at
all embarrassed for not figuring
that NF stood for new frosh (new
this quarter or winter quarter) and
that NL meant non-letterman. We
had naturally assumed that any
one without an * was not a letter
man and therefore thought NL pos
simly designated a transfer from
the National Professional League, or
something similar.
(loach Taylor's Defense
As far as positions go, offensive
symbols are standard, but on the
defensive squad we noticed an MG.
LIB, MLB, and an KLB. The key
straightened us out on these.
In the present Taylor defense, a
five-three-two-one, the MG stands
for middle guard, who is flanked by
two tackles and a pair of ends. Then
the LLB, MLB, and RLB were de
coded as left line backer, middle
line backer, and right line backer.
The defense was completed by a
pair of halfbacks and a safety,
whose symbols were already famil
iar to us.
Lucky we have a long summer
to assimilate this new system of
symbols.
