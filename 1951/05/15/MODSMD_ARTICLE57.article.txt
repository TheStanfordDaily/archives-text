his varsity team, and one manager
will fly down tu UCLA Thursday
morning to take part in the an
nual PCC swimming and divbvf
championships Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday nights.
Haynie's aggregation is heavily
favored to win the meet over USC,
Cal, and UCLA, probably in that
order.
Four of last year's individual
champions will be returning, one
from each school. Boh Frojen won
the 100 breaststroke us a sopho
more last year, while Monte Nitz
kowski of UCLA took the 200
breaststroke, and Bill Phillips of
Cal won the 150 individual medley.
All these were record - breaking
performances.
Johnny MeCormick won the
three-meter diving last year, but
the 28-year-old junior will have to
beat Stanford's Bill Glathe to win
the three-meter crown again, and
also the newly added low-board
diving. Glathe was hotter than a
firecracker Saturday against Cal,
rolling up -100 points, which with
out analyzing the judging would
have placed high in the NCAA meet
this year.
Bobby Thompson and Pete Cole
have snared records in their re
spective favorite races, the 220- and
440-yard freestyle. Thompson and
Cole both hold the 220 record, hav
ing swum a dead heat against
UCLA in the outstanding time of
2:10.0. Recently, however, Cole has
been sticking to the longer race, and
got the PCC mark in the quarter
last week against Cal. Pete swam
4:40.5, to break Ralph Sala's record
of 4:43.5.
Thompson, a spohomore, wants
the furlong record all to himself,
as witnessed by his 2:08.1 trial
mark last week.
Both relay records have been
beaten by Stanford teams this year.
Thompson, Bruce Putnam. Bert
Holiday, and Phil Chapman set a
new mark in the four-man 400-
yard freestyle relay in the SC meet,
swimming it in 3:31.5, an average
of just a shade under 53 seconds per
man.
Holiday, . Frojen, and Putnam
swam the medley relay in 2:54.2,
also in the meet with the Trojans.
Haynie has said, however, that he is
going to split up the relay teams
and concentrate the men in indi
vidual races.

got the PCC mark in the quarter
last week against Cal. Pete swam
4:40.5, to break Ralph Sala's record
of 4:43.5.
Thompson, a spohomore, wants
the furlong record all to himself,
as witnessed by his 2:08.1 trial
mark last week.
Both relay records have been
beaten by Stanford teams this year.
Thompson, Bruce Putnam. Bert
Holiday, and Phil Chapman set a
new mark in the four-man 400-
yard freestyle relay in the SC meet,
swimming it in 3:31.5, an average
of just a shade under 53 seconds per
man.
Holiday, . Frojen, and Putnam
swam the medley relay in 2:54.2,
also in the meet with the Trojans.
Haynie has said, however, that he is
going to split up the relay teams
and concentrate the men in indi
vidual races.
Tom Ilaynie, 17 swimmers from
his varsity team, and one manager
will fly down tu UCLA Thursday
morning to take part in the an
nual PCC swimming and divbvf
championships Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday nights.
Haynie's aggregation is heavily
favored to win the meet over USC,
Cal, and UCLA, probably in that
order.
Four of last year's individual
champions will be returning, one
from each school. Boh Frojen won
the 100 breaststroke us a sopho
more last year, while Monte Nitz
kowski of UCLA took the 200
breaststroke, and Bill Phillips of
Cal won the 150 individual medley.
All these were record - breaking
performances.
Johnny MeCormick won the
three-meter diving last year, but
the 28-year-old junior will have to
beat Stanford's Bill Glathe to win
the three-meter crown again, and
also the newly added low-board
diving. Glathe was hotter than a
firecracker Saturday against Cal,
rolling up -100 points, which with
out analyzing the judging would
have placed high in the NCAA meet
this year.
Bobby Thompson and Pete Cole
have snared records in their re
spective favorite races, the 220- and
440-yard freestyle. Thompson and
Cole both hold the 220 record, hav
ing swum a dead heat against
UCLA in the outstanding time of
2:10.0. Recently, however, Cole has
been sticking to the longer race, and
got the PCC mark in the quarter
last week against Cal. Pete swam
4:40.5, to break Ralph Sala's record
of 4:43.5.
