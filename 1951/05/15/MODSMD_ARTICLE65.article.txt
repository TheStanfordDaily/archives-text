QUOTE OF THE WEEK—When a UCLA pinch-hitter came to the plate
in last Saturday's Bruin-Indian baseball game, Umpire Thomas Seacap
shouted to George Anderson, official scorer, "The hitter is McMullen."
The Stanford bench taunted, "What's the matte};, ump, McMullen can't
hit."
Arbiter Seacap faced the Stanford bench, politely doffed his cap, and
announced, "Excuse me, the batter is McMullen."

FASTER THAN SOUND DEPT.—Alexander Graham Bell is just another
obscure inventor as far as ace 440 man Bill Storum is concerned. When
Storum discovered a fixe in Bill McColl and Dntig Pinto's room in the Zete
House, he was faced with the decision of (1) phoning the Fire Department
or (2) running the 400 yards from the Zete House to the station. Anyone
else would have lifted the receiver, but remember Storum is a track man.
He lit out for the Fire Department, as goggle-eyed bystanders watched him
swish by faster than a Chappie joke.

FOREIGNER ON THE CAMPUS.—A few weeks ago at football practice,
the gridders were going through their paces when suddenly a new player
caught their collective eye. He was running around, catching passes. It
wasn't his athletic grace that caused them to take notice, however, it was |
the color of his uniform. A shocking blue and gold.
Several were all set to get the clippers and shave an "S" on his head, when
the newcomer revealed his identity. It was none other than Doodles Weaver,
Stanford's legendary prankster.

SUCCESS STORY.—At 5:47 p.m. last Saturday, basehaller Bruce
Cameron was probably the saddest man in America. At 5:48 p.m. he was
the happiest.
Partly because of a Cameron boot, the Cards had lost the first game of a
double-header to UCLA, and were tied, 2 to 2, in the second. Shortpatcher
Bruce stepped to the plate in the fifth inning with two down. Cameron, who |
had been the sweetest third baseman in the league last year, had been
having his woes this season. His last 25 trips to the plate had resulted in an
unblemished record of unsuccess.
Bruin hurler Warren Hart fed him a perfect pitch, and diminutive
Brucie golfed it with all his strength. The ball wAs still growing wings
as it flew over the leftfield fence. Bruce was so happy he did a little jig
as he rcunded third base. The Card bench jumped onto the field and
swarmed all over Brucie, and if they had been wearing lipstick, he'd
have looked like a tomato.
Cameron, incidentally, bccame the eleventh man to hit a homer out of ;
the Sunken Damond and the first college player to hit two out of it.
SOREST NOSE ON CAMPUS.—It belongs to end Maurice Twitchell, who
valiantly blocked Bob Meyers' punt last Saturday with his schnozz.
HATS OFF TO GRID STAFF.—The other day we were talking with Dink
Templeton, who for our money is the only sports columnist in the Bay Area ;
who realiy knows what he's talking about when he knocks out a column.
He commented that if the football team had any potential at all, Chuck
Taylor and his staff would bring it out. All of it.
We concur. Taylor and the staff spent four hours a day just in planning I
each day's practice. During a recent three-week stretch, red-thatched i
Chuck only ate dinner at home once. The rest of the nights were spent talk- 1
ing at high school and alumni dinners.
A look at the plays in last Saturday's scrimmage Showed that something i
new had been added. Halfbacks were sweeping the flanks with three, four,
and five-man interference. Even the bootleg play, which is characteristically
a one-man affair, found a blocker in front of the ball-carrier last Saturday. I
Bobby Griffin blocked and Gary Kerkorian skirted for 20 yards.
SPORTS YUK, —An exciting pitchers' duel was being waged at a ball
game a few weeks back. The game was nearing its end when a boy and
his girl friend entered the park.
"What's the score?" asked the girl.
'•Nothing to nothing," was the reply.
"Ob goodie, then we haven't missed a thing."

HATS OFF TO GRID STAFF.—The other day we were talking with Dink
Templeton, who for our money is the only sports columnist in the Bay Area ;
who realiy knows what he's talking about when he knocks out a column.
He commented that if the football team had any potential at all, Chuck
Taylor and his staff would bring it out. All of it.
We concur. Taylor and the staff spent four hours a day just in planning I
each day's practice. During a recent three-week stretch, red-thatched i
Chuck only ate dinner at home once. The rest of the nights were spent talk- 1
ing at high school and alumni dinners.
A look at the plays in last Saturday's scrimmage Showed that something i
new had been added. Halfbacks were sweeping the flanks with three, four,
and five-man interference. Even the bootleg play, which is characteristically
a one-man affair, found a blocker in front of the ball-carrier last Saturday. I
Bobby Griffin blocked and Gary Kerkorian skirted for 20 yards.
SPORTS YUK, —An exciting pitchers' duel was being waged at a ball
game a few weeks back. The game was nearing its end when a boy and
his girl friend entered the park.
"What's the score?" asked the girl.
'•Nothing to nothing," was the reply.
"Ob goodie, then we haven't missed a thing."
QUOTE OF THE WEEK—When a UCLA pinch-hitter came to the plate
in last Saturday's Bruin-Indian baseball game, Umpire Thomas Seacap
shouted to George Anderson, official scorer, "The hitter is McMullen."
The Stanford bench taunted, "What's the matte};, ump, McMullen can't
hit."
Arbiter Seacap faced the Stanford bench, politely doffed his cap, and
announced, "Excuse me, the batter is McMullen."

FOREIGNER ON THE CAMPUS.—A few weeks ago at football practice,
the gridders were going through their paces when suddenly a new player
caught their collective eye. He was running around, catching passes. It
wasn't his athletic grace that caused them to take notice, however, it was |
the color of his uniform. A shocking blue and gold.

SUCCESS STORY.—At 5:47 p.m. last Saturday, basehaller Bruce
Cameron was probably the saddest man in America. At 5:48 p.m. he was
the happiest.
Partly because of a Cameron boot, the Cards had lost the first game of a
double-header to UCLA, and were tied, 2 to 2, in the second. Shortpatcher
Bruce stepped to the plate in the fifth inning with two down. Cameron, who |
had been the sweetest third baseman in the league last year, had been
having his woes this season. His last 25 trips to the plate had resulted in an
unblemished record of unsuccess.
Bruin hurler Warren Hart fed him a perfect pitch, and diminutive
Brucie golfed it with all his strength. The ball wAs still growing wings
as it flew over the leftfield fence. Bruce was so happy he did a little jig
as he rcunded third base. The Card bench jumped onto the field and
swarmed all over Brucie, and if they had been wearing lipstick, he'd
have looked like a tomato.
