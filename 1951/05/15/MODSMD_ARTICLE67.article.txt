## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
To prove that "taste is a
changing idea," the Stanford

! ing exhibits of furniture, cloth- j
[ ing, and art objects from varied
countries at varied times.
The show will close Sunday, It
can be seen between 10 a.m. and 4
p.m. Monday through Saturday and
from 12 to 5 p.m. on Sunday.
( An almost unbelievable variety of
j chairs highlights the exhibit. Among
them are early and modern United
' States styles, an ornate carved
| wooden chair from India, find an
I imaginative African number crc
j atcd from the horns and fur of some
! unknown animal. One chair exhibit
I is labeled "A chair should conform
!to body contours—or vice versa."
"Taste is influenced by what we
feel about reality" marks a paint
ing display in which realism is
hung beside impressionism. "Taste
enhances function" is illustrated
by decorated dishes—among them
Egyptian, American, and Euro
■ pean.
Included in the sculpture exhibit
is an Egyptian cat which Mrs. Rob
ert Cross, Art Gallery director, con
siders "very valuable." There is
also a stark white replica of a
veiled .woman. Similar statues were
very much in vogue around 1850.
Mrs. Cross explained.
"For amazement only" is the la

va.'es, and tormented figurines that
j the director says were probably not
j in good taste in any .period.

: rebel through art. The tortured
human faces in his black and
while woodcuts are intended to
portray the horror and cruelty of
