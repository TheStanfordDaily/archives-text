# Stegner To Talk On Asia Writers
## 
### TOM NEVILLE 
Dr. Wallace Stegner, who has just returned from an extended
academic tour of the Far East, finds it difficult to analyze Asian
literary life without sticking his neck out and making political
observations.
The Director of the Stanford Creative Writing Center said yes-

terday no matter how impartially I
one looks at the strictly creative side |
of Asian intellectual life, current. !
politics ultimately color one's judg
ment.
Dr. Stegner will report on his
meetings and discussions with writ
ers in Japan, the Philippines, Siam,
India, and Egypt tonight at 7:.'JO in
Memorial Hall auditorium, in a
Tuesday Evening Series lecture
called "Literary Lessons out of
Asia."
Accompanied by his wife and 13- !
year-old son, Dr. Stegner was sent to j
investigate the intellectual climate of
Asia on a grant jointly sponsored by
Stanford and the Rockefeller Found
ation.
Japan, partly because of a calm
political atmosphere and partly be
cause of widespread literacy, is en-

joying the most active intellectual life !
of any country in Asia, Dr. Stcgncr
said.
In contrast to Japan, where "re
sponsible people arc apparently very
friendly and apt to be grateful to
Americans," Dr. Stegner character
ized India as confused intellectually. ;
There is, however, a general in
terest in "proletarian literature," in
dicating, says the 41-year-old author, !
a political inclination leftward.
The author of "Women on the
Wall," and"The Preacher and the
Slave," tonight's speaker has the j
Guggenheim Fellowship to write a
biography of John Wesley Powell,
first explorer of the Colorado River
and founder of the Geological Survey !
of the United States Bureau of Eth
nology.
