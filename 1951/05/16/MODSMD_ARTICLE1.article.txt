## Bradley Says U.S. In 'Wrong War' 
### 
WASIINIC.TON. May 15 (UP) â€”
Gen. Omar N. Bradley said yester
day that Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's
strategy for expanding the war
against Communist China would in
volve the United States "in the
wrong war, at the wrong place, at
the wrong time, and with the wrong
enemy."
Bradley, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said bluntly that
Russia is the real enemy and that
carrying the war to Red China
"would probably delight the Krem
lin more than anything else we
could do." It also would increase
the risk of world war, he said, and
might drive away our allies.
The genera] admitted that he is
"not too sure" present policies will
bring victory in Korea.
But he said that our "global
strategy" is "paying off" and has
thus far avoided a world war that,
wduld kill "millions" of civilians
and soldiers. Therefore, he saw no
reason to let "impatience" with the
course of the Korean war alter basic
Far Eastern policies.
