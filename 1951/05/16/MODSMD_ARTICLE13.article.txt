# Stegner Urges Increased Asian Literary Exchange
## 
### 
One example of misunder
standing between Asia and the
United States, Dr. Wallace Steg
ner told a Tuesday Evening
Series audience last night, is the
fact that Communists often use
books by Caldwell and Stein
beck and other American "pro
letarian writers" as anti-Ameri
ran propaganda.
To correct this situation and other
equally serious misunderstandings,
Dr. Stegncr advised sending as much
good American literature as possible
into Japan, the Philippines, and espe
cially India.
Wc should try, he urged, to export
American literature as a whole (in
so far as it is possible) and not iso
lated examples dealing with a special
set of circumstances or problem.
Boks in which "we discuss ourselves
when no one else is listening," he
emphasized, cannot be construed as
propaganda to the average reader.
Unfortunately, he went on, Asia is
beset with political chaos which adds
to the difficulties involved in devel
oping a culturally conscious public.
In India, for example, the official
language is by no means universally
spoken or understood. Regionalism
and linguistic sectionalism often turn
language into an emotionally charged
political issue.
Japan, the lecturer said, is a "na
tion of readers," and has an active
intellectual life, offering a contrast to
the rest of Asia. Writers in the Phil-
Books inwh ich "wc discuss ourselves
selves in the characteristic plight of
the "classic, rootless, Asia intellec
tual."
Writers in the Orient are prone
either to work for extreme political
change or to seek a calm, contempla
tive existence, writing about village
life and folkways.
