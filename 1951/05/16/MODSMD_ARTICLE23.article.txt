# Two-Way Traffic Needed
## 
### 
One of the best features of Stanford's resi
dence campus is the choice of residence-type
it offers to the women students.
Having both large and small living groups
available is a double advantage to the women.
First, it provides the opportunity for each girl
to try different residences and to broaden her
experience in campus living. Second, it pro
vides the "right place" for the girl who may be
definitely unsuited to one way of living or the
other.
This double advantage can only be realized
when theie is a two-way movement of women
between the large and small residences. Right
now, the emphasis is on the movement from
the dorms to the Row houses. Women who get
on the Row tend to regard it as a dead end, and
few of them ever consider moving again.
This attitude not only cancels the overall
benefit of the housing set-up, but it also works
to the disadvantage of individuals.
For instance, there are women who find, after
trying Row life, that it does not meet their
needs. They prefer the greater privacy and
less regimentation of the large dorm. Required
participation in certain house activities seems
to them a waste of time.
These women should feel no hesitation in
leaving-the Row- There should be no social
pressure, no feeling that they have somehow

failed to adjust, because they have found life
in a small house is not tor them.
Furthermore, observation over the past
tew years has shown that the women who
move on the How as sophomores, and stay
there tor three full years, do not have as ac
tive a record in school activities as those who
stay in the large dorms, or who have at least
spent some time in both.
Evidently the sophomores are more suscep
tible to the Row legend of constant party-time,
and in centering all their interest around the
house they forget larger campus participation.
Many women who have shown promise as
freshmen lose their enthusiasm and settle into
a narrow routine of limited activities.
This is not universally true, of course. But it
is true enough to present a challenge to the
Row women to guard against the kind of self
satisfaction that kills accomplishment.
Every woman at Stanford is entitled to try
tor her own preference in housing. No move
should be considered final unless the resi
dence satisfies the student and contributes to
her well-rounded college experience.
We hope that sophomores and juniors, as
well as freshmen, will consider these points
before they make the decision about the fall
quarter residence drawing next Thursday.

it offers to the women students.
Having both large and small living groups
available is a double advantage to the women.
First, it provides the opportunity for each girl
to try different residences and to broaden her
experience in campus living. Second, it pro
vides the "right place" for the girl who may be
definitely unsuited to one way of living or the
other.
This double advantage can only be realized
when theie is a two-way movement of women
between the large and small residences. Right
now, the emphasis is on the movement from
the dorms to the Row houses. Women who get
on the Row tend to regard it as a dead end, and
few of them ever consider moving again.
This attitude not only cancels the overall
benefit of the housing set-up, but it also works
to the disadvantage of individuals.
For instance, there are women who find, after
trying Row life, that it does not meet their
needs. They prefer the greater privacy and
less regimentation of the large dorm. Required
participation in certain house activities seems
to them a waste of time.
These women should feel no hesitation in
leaving-the Row- There should be no social
pressure, no feeling that they have somehow

failed to adjust, because they have found life
in a small house is not tor them.
Furthermore, observation over the past
tew years has shown that the women who
move on the How as sophomores, and stay
there tor three full years, do not have as ac
tive a record in school activities as those who
stay in the large dorms, or who have at least
spent some time in both.
Evidently the sophomores are more suscep
tible to the Row legend of constant party-time,
and in centering all their interest around the
house they forget larger campus participation.
Many women who have shown promise as
freshmen lose their enthusiasm and settle into
a narrow routine of limited activities.
This is not universally true, of course. But it
is true enough to present a challenge to the
Row women to guard against the kind of self
satisfaction that kills accomplishment.
Every woman at Stanford is entitled to try
tor her own preference in housing. No move
should be considered final unless the resi
dence satisfies the student and contributes to
her well-rounded college experience.
We hope that sophomores and juniors, as
well as freshmen, will consider these points
before they make the decision about the fall
quarter residence drawing next Thursday.
