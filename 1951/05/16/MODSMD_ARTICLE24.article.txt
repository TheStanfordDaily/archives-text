### PETE GROTHE 
A .
EARLY MOKNINC; CAMPUS CANDID

(Editor's Note: This is the second in a series of
Pete Grot he's Bull Sessions on "Inside Stanford.")
A Bull Sessioner is always looking for a new slant, a
new "angle" from which to write about Stanford.
That's why I got up at the crack of dawn yesterday. I

wanted to see what kind of a story
the early-morning Stanford could
tell nitflyrthe Stanford that was
just begjlWieg to throw off its bed
eovengS -
Fii out to the football
\U.di ■. dim be d to the top
tx-nihjsfrhte'Haming ball of sun
was inn in g to peek
epening in the south
east remembered times
when 9ti ; 000 posteriors had edged

into the 90,000 seats, when the bellows oi' hawkers
could be heard above the din of the crowd, and when
the whole crowd had risen as one person to watch a
spectacular play. But now the ghostly stadium was
dead silent, and only little droplets of dew covered the
benches.
If the Stadium could break its muteness—what a
story it could tell! It could boast about the great
footballers who had dug their cleats into its soft,
clean turf—the Neveis, the Graysons, the Alberts,
the Standlees. It could even I:rag that a future
President of the United States had crossed its field
carrying buckets of water to the players during
time-outs.
Next I went up to Lake Lag, and if you want to see
two entirely different bodies of water, take a look at
the lake in the afternoon and then see it in the early
morning. This wasn't the caricature of a lake that
everyone kidded about—the lake of choppy waves and
many bugs, the lake where in late spring the fish get
humpbacked trying to stay under water.
No, this lake had beauty—stark, real beauty. The
gentle, green foothills in the background and the bushy
trees that lined the hike were mirrored perfectly in its
placid waters. Two ducks east their reflection in the
giant looking glass us they swept over the water and
then out of sight.
I lett Lake Lag and walked up and down the Row.

It was the same Kow you see at any other time of day
—only without the volleyball games, the front-lawn
games of catch, the kids exchanging "hellos" as they
pass friends on the sidewalk, and the rattle-traps put
tering down the street.
Five or six robins, all in good voice, were sitting on
the top of the massive black car in front of Stillman.
One of them flew over to the Alpha Delt lawn,
plucked out a fat. wrigly worm, and then winged off
before any of his friends could come to share the
spoils.
I walked down past the Union and the Cellar, where
the aroma of frying bacon tingled my nostrils apd
through the Inner Quad. The bright early-morning sun
gave a new glory to the Biblical figures on the Chapel
mosaic.
I passed by the many empty classrooms. By the time
the am had set, students would have absorbed 24,000
hours of knowledge in those rooms.
I walked to the Main Libe lawn and eased myself
down on the grass. Possibly this was the best vantage
point to see the early morning Stanford. Rising above
(he massive oak tree was Hoover Tower, a poem of
symmetry and strength in its early morning brilliance.
Only the incessant chatter of the birds as they flitted
to and from their nests under the CubberleyVoof dis
turbed the silence. As I sat there watching the sun
climb higher, everything smelled fresh and clean and
good.
And it occurrcl to me that maybe this was the way
the good Lord meant things to be. With everything
so peaceful and serene, I couldn't imagine how there
could be such things as war, greed, and hatred. Those
words seemed of another world.
It was getting late now. The 10-minutes-to-8 bell
rang. In the distance I heard the whistle of a com
muters' train. Any minute now a swarm of students
would come down from the Row—girls in crisp cotton
dresses, boys in blue denims and Hawaiian shirts.
And for a moment, a fleeting moment, I wished that I
were a great poet or artist, so I could capture the
whole picture in immortal rhyme or a never-to-be
forgotten painting.
Soon the sleeping giant would be a vibrant, pulsat
ing - Stanford, and the tranquility would be lost. I
looked once more at the peaceful picture, then turned,
and slowly walked off to class.
