TOKYO, May 15â€”The "last gasp"
Korean Communist efTort to throw
the Allies out of Korea may have
been inspired by a spy's warning
on the Inchon landing, a reliable in
telligence source said today.
He said privately that Yoshimatsu
Iwamura, who was captured with
"super top secret" information on
the Inchon landing in his posses
sion, also had a radio which could
have been used to alert Red Korea.
Iwamura, alleged leader of a
Communist spy ring, is being tried,
with 17 other Korean and Japanese
Communists, in Japan's first ma
jor spy trial since the war. They
were arrested last September,
shortly before the Inchon landing.
