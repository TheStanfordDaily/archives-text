The final concert of this year's |
chamber music series, held Sunday !
afternoon at Cubberley Auditorium, \
showed the fine things being ac- I
complished under Sandor Salgo's I
chamber music program in the mu- j
sic department.
Distinctly one of the highlights of ;
the concert was the rich-sounding I
oboe playing of George Houle in \
Handel's C minor Sonata for oboe, I
harpsichord, and 'cello. The long i
Baroque phrase presents no audible I
difficulties for Houle's exemplary I
breath control, and he does not let j
out the Hat, piercing high notes that
mar many an oboist's performances, j
Robert Keine and Jean Osborn
were the able partners in this pre
sentation, which was equaled in au
thority by that of Mozart's E flat
Trio later in the program. This j
piece, for the unusual but fortui
tous combination ol clarinet, viola,
and piano, was beautifully felt and !
articulated by Muriel Beimel, Ynez
Lynch, and Norma Redciert.
The program was opened with j
one of Beethoven's most melodious j
compositions, his F major Sonata j
I for violin and piano, which was giv
en a tasteful and communicative, if
occasionally unfinished, perform-
I ance by William Jenkinson and Ro
| salie Speciale.—A. Is.
