# Crew to Host Bears Saturday; Will Third Try Be the Charm?
## 
### DEWEY HECHT 
A new Card varsity crew, jelled
j together in last week's Washington
! Regatta, hosts California's top shell
i in a grueling three-mile race Satur
day morning at the Palo Alto Yacht
Harbor at 10:30. This is the fifth
encounter of the two schools in a
dual meet since the war.
It will also be the third race in
which both Cal and Stanford have
participated this year. The first, the
Newport Regatta, found the Card
1 crew trailing by three lengths at the
| end of 2,000 meters. Last week at
; Washington, after leading the Bear
J shell for over half of the race, the
Cards tired in the stretch and Cal
| managed to pass them to earn a
hard-fought second place.
Workouts this week have been

aimed at putting the necessary dis
tance on the Stanford shells to en
able them to keep a high beat at the
finish of the race.
Should Be Even
Although Cal is favored by a few
seconds Saturday, Coach Jim Beggs
has stated that enough experience
was gained at Washington to make
this race one of the most evenly
matched of the season. The Indians
will have another chance at Cal and
Washington when they contend for
national honors at Marietta in
June—if the Cards raise the money
for the trip.
Boatings have been switched
since the Newport Regatta in an at
tempt to find the smoothest com
bination. New men moved into the
first shell are Sam Stearns, No. 2;

Lan (Chief) Hendrickson, No. 3; and
Hal Canipen, No. 5. A major change j
was made at stroke when Jim Fi- !
fer, crew captain, went back to the |
crucial No. 8 stroke spot, which he
filled last year.
Stress Longer Reach
One of the points Beggs has been
stressing is reach, whereby an oars
man pulls more water while rowing
at a lower stroke. This is in antici
pation of the longer races which
will be held the remainder of the
season over three-mile courses.
JV and frosh also will compete
with Cal Saturday morning, racing
after the varsity. The frosh have
one of the finest first - year crews
ever to be assembled at Stanford.
Victory hopes to ride with the fledg
lings and the varsity. The frosh !
race is held, p.ver a two-mile course. I
JV outlook is not too bright for j
the Saturday grind. Several men |
have been lost to sick bay, while j
grades have claimed a number "of '
other oarbenders. The JV's stayed >
home to work all last week on their ;
form and endurance, and, while not j
yet at their peak, will offer some .
competition to the Cal second boat. \
Their race is over a three - mile I
course. 1

| managed to pass them to earn a
hard-fought second place.
Workouts this week have been

aimed at putting the necessary dis
tance on the Stanford shells to en
able them to keep a high beat at the
finish of the race.
Should Be Even
Although Cal is favored by a few
seconds Saturday, Coach Jim Beggs
has stated that enough experience
was gained at Washington to make
this race one of the most evenly
matched of the season. The Indians
will have another chance at Cal and
Washington when they contend for
national honors at Marietta in
June—if the Cards raise the money
for the trip.
Boatings have been switched
since the Newport Regatta in an at
tempt to find the smoothest com
bination. New men moved into the
first shell are Sam Stearns, No. 2;

Lan (Chief) Hendrickson, No. 3; and
Hal Canipen, No. 5. A major change j
was made at stroke when Jim Fi- !
fer, crew captain, went back to the |
crucial No. 8 stroke spot, which he
filled last year.
Stress Longer Reach
One of the points Beggs has been
stressing is reach, whereby an oars
man pulls more water while rowing
at a lower stroke. This is in antici
pation of the longer races which
will be held the remainder of the
season over three-mile courses.
JV and frosh also will compete
with Cal Saturday morning, racing
after the varsity. The frosh have
one of the finest first - year crews
ever to be assembled at Stanford.
Victory hopes to ride with the fledg
lings and the varsity. The frosh !
race is held, p.ver a two-mile course. I
JV outlook is not too bright for j
the Saturday grind. Several men |
have been lost to sick bay, while j
grades have claimed a number "of '
other oarbenders. The JV's stayed >
home to work all last week on their ;
form and endurance, and, while not j
yet at their peak, will offer some .
competition to the Cal second boat. \
Their race is over a three - mile I
course. 1
