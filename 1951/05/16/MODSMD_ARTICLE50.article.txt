# 'MacArthur Is the U.S.'
## 
### SUE GOODSTEIN 
While General Mac Arthur is
the subject of a controversial de
bate now raging throughout this
country, ironically enough, to
the Japanese people Mac Arthur
represents the United States it
self.
Keiko Ishikawa, ASSU foreign
scholar from Tokyo, described the
general's impact on the Japanese
people in one phrase—"He was head
of everything."
When the American government
imported food during the terrible
period of shortages following the war
for the people of Japan, it was Mac-
Arthur's doing. In fact, Reiko pointed
out, any order or authorization al
ways bore the general's name.
Successful Leadership
Reiko attributed Mac Arthur's suc
cessful leadership to two factors.
First, the general displayed the char
acteristics of a leader that the Japa
nese were used to. HLs dignity, aus
terity, and reserve were qualities in
herent in the Japanese tradition.
The people respected a man who
never took a vacation, and who never
appeared in public. They admired
him for being a typical soldier, a hard
worker, and a man who showed that
his word was law.
Second, Reiko explancd that Mac-
Arthur, upon showing his authority,
had passed the first test. After that
the people accepted him without
questioning.
Mac Arthur Means Protection
Along with the acceptance of, and
reverence for, this strong leader, the
people of Japan looked to Mac-Arthur
for protection in the present conflict.
Reiko said that the Japanese people
are terrified of another war. "We,

who have witnessed the effects of
atom bombs, know that another war
would mean total destruction," she
said.
The 21-year-old coed, who is
studying speech and drama at Stan
ford, said that there is a tense feel
ing in Japan today because of the
proximity of Korea. Without an
army, the Japanese rely on the
Americans for protection.
Reiko felt that the Occupation was
so, well organized that there would
not be much change due to Mac-
Arthur's dismissal, if Ridgway could
command the same respect his prede
cessor did.
Revolution of Ideas
Paralleling the peaceful occupa
tion of Japan and Mac Arthur's
unique role is another story that is
even more phenomenal—the revolu
tion of ideas that has overtaken
Japan.
To Rciko there have been many
changes—quick changes that have af
fected every way of life, externally.
And yet, Reiko wonders whether the

people have changed internally with
j in the six short years since the war.
i Democracy is the word that has hit
j Japan. Democracy has hit education
! —women now have equal rights with
| men, and universities are opening
j their doors to female students, with
new colleges being built every day.
Feeling of Kquality
Socially, strict class- distinctions
; have been substituted by the fcelinc
! that everyone is equal. The aristo-
I cratic and royal families are now just
j like everybody else, Rciko pointed
I out.
The change that is the most difficult
j for Reiko to accept is the departure
from the Japanese tradition of kccp
i ing one's emotions to oneself.
People arc beginning to lose the re
serve that was so much a part of the
Japanese character, Rciko explained.
Boys and girls can be found holding
! hands on the street, something that
! seems unnatural to Japanese when
i done in public.
Other evidences of a change in cus-

Toms are Japanese women with
painted lips and finßernails in imita
tion of Americans. Chewing gum is
the current /ad and people can he
found eating while standing up.
For all these external evidences of
democracy in action, which the Japa
nese accepted without a rustic, Rciko
raised the question whether the
Communists, if they had been the oc
cupation, could have impressed their
ideas on the people as easily? In
other words, these changes have come
so quickly and arc such a sharp de
viation from tradition, to Rciko they
have not yet proven themselves as
definitely permanent.

Mac Arthur Means Protection
Along with the acceptance of, and
reverence for, this strong leader, the
people of Japan looked to Mac-Arthur
for protection in the present conflict.
Reiko said that the Japanese people
are terrified of another war. "We,

who have witnessed the effects of
atom bombs, know that another war
would mean total destruction," she
said.
The 21-year-old coed, who is
studying speech and drama at Stan
ford, said that there is a tense feel
ing in Japan today because of the
proximity of Korea. Without an
army, the Japanese rely on the
Americans for protection.
Reiko felt that the Occupation was
so, well organized that there would
not be much change due to Mac-
Arthur's dismissal, if Ridgway could
command the same respect his prede
cessor did.
Revolution of Ideas
Paralleling the peaceful occupa
tion of Japan and Mac Arthur's
unique role is another story that is
even more phenomenal—the revolu
tion of ideas that has overtaken
Japan.
To Rciko there have been many
changes—quick changes that have af
fected every way of life, externally.
And yet, Reiko wonders whether the

people have changed internally with
j in the six short years since the war.
i Democracy is the word that has hit
j Japan. Democracy has hit education
! —women now have equal rights with
| men, and universities are opening
j their doors to female students, with
new colleges being built every day.
Feeling of Kquality
Socially, strict class- distinctions
; have been substituted by the fcelinc
! that everyone is equal. The aristo-
I cratic and royal families are now just
j like everybody else, Rciko pointed
I out.
The change that is the most difficult
j for Reiko to accept is the departure
from the Japanese tradition of kccp
i ing one's emotions to oneself.
People arc beginning to lose the re
serve that was so much a part of the
Japanese character, Rciko explained.
Boys and girls can be found holding
! hands on the street, something that
! seems unnatural to Japanese when
i done in public.
Other evidences of a change in cus-

Toms are Japanese women with
painted lips and finßernails in imita
tion of Americans. Chewing gum is
the current /ad and people can he
found eating while standing up.
For all these external evidences of
democracy in action, which the Japa
nese accepted without a rustic, Rciko
raised the question whether the
Communists, if they had been the oc
cupation, could have impressed their
ideas on the people as easily? In
other words, these changes have come
so quickly and arc such a sharp de
viation from tradition, to Rciko they
have not yet proven themselves as
definitely permanent.

While General Mac Arthur is
the subject of a controversial de
bate now raging throughout this
country, ironically enough, to
the Japanese people Mac Arthur
represents the United States it
self.
Keiko Ishikawa, ASSU foreign
scholar from Tokyo, described the
general's impact on the Japanese
people in one phrase—"He was head
of everything."
When the American government
imported food during the terrible
period of shortages following the war
for the people of Japan, it was Mac-
Arthur's doing. In fact, Reiko pointed
out, any order or authorization al
ways bore the general's name.
Successful Leadership
Reiko attributed Mac Arthur's suc
cessful leadership to two factors.
First, the general displayed the char
acteristics of a leader that the Japa
nese were used to. HLs dignity, aus
terity, and reserve were qualities in
herent in the Japanese tradition.
The people respected a man who
never took a vacation, and who never
appeared in public. They admired
him for being a typical soldier, a hard
worker, and a man who showed that
his word was law.
Second, Reiko explancd that Mac-
Arthur, upon showing his authority,
had passed the first test. After that
the people accepted him without
questioning.

j Japan. Democracy has hit education
! —women now have equal rights with
| men, and universities are opening
j their doors to female students, with
new colleges being built every day.
Feeling of Kquality
Socially, strict class- distinctions
; have been substituted by the fcelinc
! that everyone is equal. The aristo-
I cratic and royal families are now just
j like everybody else, Rciko pointed
I out.
The change that is the most difficult
j for Reiko to accept is the departure
from the Japanese tradition of kccp
i ing one's emotions to oneself.
People arc beginning to lose the re
serve that was so much a part of the
Japanese character, Rciko explained.
Boys and girls can be found holding
! hands on the street, something that
! seems unnatural to Japanese when
i done in public.
Other evidences of a change in cus-

Toms are Japanese women with
painted lips and finßernails in imita
tion of Americans. Chewing gum is
the current /ad and people can he
found eating while standing up.
For all these external evidences of
democracy in action, which the Japa
nese accepted without a rustic, Rciko
raised the question whether the
Communists, if they had been the oc
cupation, could have impressed their
ideas on the people as easily? In
other words, these changes have come
so quickly and arc such a sharp de
viation from tradition, to Rciko they
have not yet proven themselves as
definitely permanent.
