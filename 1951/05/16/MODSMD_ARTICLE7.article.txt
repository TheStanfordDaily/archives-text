### DOROTHY DODGE 
A total of 850 persons toured
the Leland Stanford Junior Mu-,
seum yesterday, the first day of
the building's two - day trial
opening. The museum will be
open today from 10 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.
Pleased at the student response,
Museum Director Mrs. Robert Cross
commented, "We hope this display [
of interest on the part of the stu
dents will prove the worth of the
museum."
Exeom is sponsoring the trial |
opening to back up its belief that j
the building should be opened reg- ;
ularly. A report on the interest
shown will be sent to the Board of
Trustees with a recommendation
that the institution be kepi open.
Visitors' Reactions
Visitors are asked to sign the
museum's guest book when they
leave in order to make comments
and suggestions. Most of yester
day's were highly favorable, like
"fabulous" and "educational, not
painful." Many visitors suggested
keeping the building open and ex
tending the facilities. In the mi
nority were dissatisfied students
like the one who suggested, "Con
vert it to a dormitory."
Senator Stanford's train and the
Egyptian mummy are running neck
and neck in popularity, Mrs. Cross
reported. She also commented that
few faculty members were among
the visitors and she felt that they
were perhaps unaware of the mu
seum's extensive archeological and
anthropological exhibits.
Phil Saeta, Excom representative j
in charge of the museum-opening
project, pointed out that most grad
uating seniors had never had a
chance to visit the building, which ;
had been closed since 1946 for in
ventory and reclassification. Only
art and anthropology classes had
been allowed inside.
Basket Room
The anthropological displays are 1
on the building's second floor. Typ- j
ical of this section is the Basket 1
Room, which features work by j
American Indian tribes along with I
step-by-step examples of the wcav- j
ing techniques used.
Indian handicraft arranged ac- ;
cording to the tribe's habitat fills j
another room. Here is found every- j
thing from Navajo blankets to a j
carved North African war mask.
Persons who tour the museum to- j
day will also be able to visit 10th
century America the easy way via
the Elizabeth Madison Braly Room
and the Stanford family exhibits.
Miss Braly, a member of one of the
University's first graduating classes,
donated a room full of antique fur
niture. including cut glass, valuable
old china, and an old - fashioned
bedstead.
Stanfr.rdiana
Only a portion of the Stanford
iana is on display; the rest is being
kept for arrangement in a period
room if the museum is again
opened. But some articles, includ
ing Mrs. Stanford's fans. Leland
Junior's toys, arvl the Senator's ear
ly railroad souvenirs, arc shown in
the lobby and the Railroad Room.
Museum authorities were still bo- |
ing harried yesterday by questions
about thr fabled "Leland's last
breakfast." Now nonexistent, thr
"breakfast" consisted of sour imi- 1
tation food the youngest Stanford |
brought, back from a European trip. j
After it was placed on exhibit in
the museum, someone put near it a J
card reading "Little Leland's last
breakfast."
According to one story, the card
remained there a long time before
the authorities noticed it.

commented, "We hope this display [
of interest on the part of the stu
dents will prove the worth of the
museum."
Exeom is sponsoring the trial |
opening to back up its belief that j
the building should be opened reg- ;
ularly. A report on the interest
shown will be sent to the Board of
Trustees with a recommendation
that the institution be kepi open.
Visitors' Reactions
Visitors are asked to sign the
museum's guest book when they
leave in order to make comments
and suggestions. Most of yester
day's were highly favorable, like
"fabulous" and "educational, not
painful." Many visitors suggested
keeping the building open and ex
tending the facilities. In the mi
nority were dissatisfied students
like the one who suggested, "Con
vert it to a dormitory."
Senator Stanford's train and the
Egyptian mummy are running neck
and neck in popularity, Mrs. Cross
reported. She also commented that
few faculty members were among
the visitors and she felt that they
were perhaps unaware of the mu
seum's extensive archeological and
anthropological exhibits.
Phil Saeta, Excom representative j
in charge of the museum-opening
project, pointed out that most grad
uating seniors had never had a
chance to visit the building, which ;
had been closed since 1946 for in
ventory and reclassification. Only
art and anthropology classes had
been allowed inside.
Basket Room
The anthropological displays are 1
on the building's second floor. Typ- j
ical of this section is the Basket 1
Room, which features work by j
American Indian tribes along with I
step-by-step examples of the wcav- j
ing techniques used.
Indian handicraft arranged ac- ;
cording to the tribe's habitat fills j
another room. Here is found every- j
thing from Navajo blankets to a j
carved North African war mask.
Persons who tour the museum to- j
day will also be able to visit 10th
century America the easy way via
the Elizabeth Madison Braly Room
and the Stanford family exhibits.
Miss Braly, a member of one of the
University's first graduating classes,
donated a room full of antique fur
niture. including cut glass, valuable
old china, and an old - fashioned
bedstead.
Stanfr.rdiana
Only a portion of the Stanford
iana is on display; the rest is being
kept for arrangement in a period
room if the museum is again
opened. But some articles, includ
ing Mrs. Stanford's fans. Leland
Junior's toys, arvl the Senator's ear
ly railroad souvenirs, arc shown in
the lobby and the Railroad Room.
Museum authorities were still bo- |
ing harried yesterday by questions
about thr fabled "Leland's last
breakfast." Now nonexistent, thr
"breakfast" consisted of sour imi- 1
tation food the youngest Stanford |
brought, back from a European trip. j
After it was placed on exhibit in
the museum, someone put near it a J
card reading "Little Leland's last
breakfast."
According to one story, the card
remained there a long time before
the authorities noticed it.
A total of 850 persons toured
the Leland Stanford Junior Mu-,
seum yesterday, the first day of
the building's two - day trial
opening. The museum will be
open today from 10 a.m. to 4:30
p.m.
