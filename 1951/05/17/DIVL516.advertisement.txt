EVER HOLD HANDS
tLIKE THESE?
They're not soft and warm, these hands.
They're hard and cold— and mechanical.
I hey work at the Oak Ridge atomic cnergv
plant, preparing radioactive isotopes
for shipment to Bell Telephone Laboratories
and to other research ccntcrs.
These isotopes —which serve as tracers —
arc used by Bell scientists to study the
materials that go into the telephone
system. Our research men, working with
Gciger counters, arc able to detect
wear in relay contacts, impurities in metals,
the penetration of preservatives in wood.
This new research tool helps us to
learn more in less time, helps us to make
telephone equipment even more rugged
and dependable. That's especially important
light now when the Nation relies on
the telephone to help get things done.
