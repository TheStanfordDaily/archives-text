## Senate Approves Wheat to India 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 16 (UP) â€”
The Senate approved a bill today to
send 2.000,000 tons of wheat to fam
ine - stricken India on "easy" loan
terms after tacking on an amend
ment insisting on partial repayment
in strategic materials.
The measure was approved by
voice vote, with only a few Senators
shouting "no," despite a warning by
Sen. Brien McMahon, D., Conn.,
that the strategic materials provi
sion might result in "killing" this
country's humanitarian gesture.
The issue now shifts to the House
which is scheduled to take up simi
lar legislation Tuesday. StifTer op
position is expected in the
chamber where many members
have been bitterly caustic of India's
criticism of America's role in the
Korean war.
(Kay Cohrt, chairman of Stan
ford's Delhi University Affiliation
Committee, said last night that she
thought the extensive Congression
al debate had perhaps weakened
the beneficial effect we could have
expected from an early granting of
the loan.
("However, it is encouraging to
see the present action in the Sen
ate," she said. She did not comment
on t lie amendment.)
