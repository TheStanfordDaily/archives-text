# Excom Wants Museum Open
## 
### 
Excom yesterday afternoon sent a
| recommendation to the Board of
Trustees that the Stanford Museum
i be opened on a regular basis next
i year.
Between closed sessions of the Ex
ecutive Committee, Phil Saeta, rep
resentative in charge of the project,
called attention to the fact that 2.000
persons had visited the Museum in
the past two days. He said he be
lieved such a turn-out justified the
Museum's being opened more fre
quently.
Excom spent a large part of its two
; hour meeting in closed sessions, dur
! ing which the members approved
next year's men's sponsors, Rally
Com officers, and foreign exchange
I scholars.
I (The list of men's sponsors will ap
i pear in tomorrow's Daily; the other
approvals arc listed in adjoining ar
ticles.)
In other business, Excom also ap
proved the appropriation of $1,250 to
j purchase two rebuilt projection heads
1 for the 35 mm. ASSU motion picture
; projectors in Mem Aud.
Rally Com was allocated a room in
the Quad building for an office. The
Student Federalists had previously
applied for the room, but the major
ity of Excom members felt, Rally
Com, because of its wider value to
the student body as a whole, should
be granted the room.
Excom also approved the holding
of interviews next week for Public
Relations Committee director, and
okayed the itemized budgets of Pub
lic Relations Committee ($475), the
Debate Society ($1,300), and Cardi
nals ($2,675).
