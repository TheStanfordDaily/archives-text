# Concert Instead Of Sunday Movie
## 
### 
The Stanford Band takes over the
usual Sunday Evening Movie spot
this Sunday nieht, when the 105-
picee group presents its annual
spring conccrt at 8:15 in Memorial
Auditorium.
Admission to this event is free,
and the public is invited.
Conductor Julius Shuchal will di
rect his musicians in a varied pro
gram of seven selections.
Shuchat describes the program as
"better than last year's." Last year's
concert featured Ferde Grofe as
guest, conductor of his own compo
sition, "Aviation Suite."
A highlight of Sunday's program
will be the playing of C. M. Weber's
"Second Concerto for Clarinet" by
Muriel Beimel, Stanford freshman.
Perhaps the most familiar num
ber on the program is Tsehaikov
sky's brilliant "Overture 18i2."
A very different, composition is
Henry CowcM's "A Curse and a
Blessing." This music tells the : tory
of one of the great gods of Irish
mythology, Balor of the Evil Eye.
According to legend. Balor was
usually good natured, but whenever
he opened his evil eye the curse of
his glance destroyed everything
within range of its sight.
