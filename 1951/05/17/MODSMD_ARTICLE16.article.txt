# 'We'll Alter Our Ways' Chaparral
## 
### 
Excom yesterday heard a pre
pared statement by John Moth
eral, Chaparral business mana
ger, regarding the recent sus- !
pension of the humor magazine.
Mothcral said that Hammer and
Coffin Society, publisher of the maga
zine, had met Tuesday night and is
now "in the process of changing its
methods of operation to cope with
future lapses of the good judgment
of society members."
The statement emphasized repeat
edly that "the society fully realizes
the grave. indiscretions of which it
was Ruilty in the May issue of the
magazine, and realizes also its re- j
sponsibilities to the student body and I
to the University were not well dis- j
charged."
"However, the point must be
made at this time . . . that the
Hanvner and Coffin Society is the j
complete and full and only owner j
of the Stanford Chaparral, and that, !
as such, it considers itself and must j
he considered by others, as being J
the agency responsible for what ap- j
pears in the magazine," Mothcral
went on to say.
He also commented on the sug
gestion (as made in a Daily editorial i
Monday) of turning jurisdiction in j
such matters to the Fundamental j
Standard Committee or the Men's i
and Women's Councils:
"Because . . . the question of cen- j
sorship or punishment in relation to
matters concerning the differences
between obscenity and decency . . .
lies in the twilight zone where no two
individuals can ever come to a satis
factory agreement, we are opposed in
principle to making such a matter a
question of review by any student
committee."
The business manager went on to
point out that in every case whero
students have judged publications,
; the publication's quality has fallen
and it has become the "pawn of
student politics."
He said that student officers cannot
be considered more mature than col
i lege editors, and the society prefers to
! continue responsibility to the pres
ently constituted authorities only.
Moth era 1 asked Excom to defer any
I positive legislative action in regard to
students boards having disciplinary
i action over such a matter until next
J fall, "when we will be better pre
j pared to soothe question in its proper
i light, without subjective influences
I and without partiality."
When asked whether or not Stan
Norton, editor of the Chappie, had
been suspended from the University,
I Mothcral refused to comment.
"It has always been a policy of the
University not to release information
in relation to students disciplined by
agents of the University," said in his
I statement.
In an attempt to dispel rumors as
to Norton's status, Mothcral urged
Excom to consult the Dean of Stu
dents before believing what they
hear, and said that:
"1. Norton has not been required
to reimburse the magazine for
revenue lost through our failure to
publish the June issue; 2. He has
not been dismissed from the so
ciety; 3. He has not been left by
the socicty to take the entire 'rap'
for this matter; 4. The socicty feels
equally responsible with Norton for
i the May issue."

Coffin Society, publisher of the maga
zine, had met Tuesday night and is
now "in the process of changing its
methods of operation to cope with
future lapses of the good judgment
of society members."
The statement emphasized repeat
edly that "the society fully realizes
the grave. indiscretions of which it
was Ruilty in the May issue of the
magazine, and realizes also its re- j
sponsibilities to the student body and I
to the University were not well dis- j
charged."
"However, the point must be
made at this time . . . that the
Hanvner and Coffin Society is the j
complete and full and only owner j
of the Stanford Chaparral, and that, !
as such, it considers itself and must j
he considered by others, as being J
the agency responsible for what ap- j
pears in the magazine," Mothcral
went on to say.
He also commented on the sug
gestion (as made in a Daily editorial i
Monday) of turning jurisdiction in j
such matters to the Fundamental j
Standard Committee or the Men's i
and Women's Councils:
"Because . . . the question of cen- j
sorship or punishment in relation to
matters concerning the differences
between obscenity and decency . . .
lies in the twilight zone where no two
individuals can ever come to a satis
factory agreement, we are opposed in
principle to making such a matter a
question of review by any student
committee."
The business manager went on to
point out that in every case whero
students have judged publications,
; the publication's quality has fallen
and it has become the "pawn of
student politics."
He said that student officers cannot
be considered more mature than col
i lege editors, and the society prefers to
! continue responsibility to the pres
ently constituted authorities only.
Moth era 1 asked Excom to defer any
I positive legislative action in regard to
students boards having disciplinary
i action over such a matter until next
J fall, "when we will be better pre
j pared to soothe question in its proper
i light, without subjective influences
I and without partiality."
When asked whether or not Stan
Norton, editor of the Chappie, had
been suspended from the University,
I Mothcral refused to comment.
"It has always been a policy of the
University not to release information
in relation to students disciplined by
agents of the University," said in his
I statement.
In an attempt to dispel rumors as
to Norton's status, Mothcral urged
Excom to consult the Dean of Stu
dents before believing what they
hear, and said that:
"1. Norton has not been required
to reimburse the magazine for
revenue lost through our failure to
publish the June issue; 2. He has
not been dismissed from the so
ciety; 3. He has not been left by
the socicty to take the entire 'rap'
for this matter; 4. The socicty feels
equally responsible with Norton for
i the May issue."
Excom yesterday heard a pre
pared statement by John Moth
eral, Chaparral business mana
ger, regarding the recent sus- !
pension of the humor magazine.
Mothcral said that Hammer and
Coffin Society, publisher of the maga
