### EARL ODELL 
Spring lias finally arrived!
I've been pessimistically closing my eyes to the fact,
but it's too hot to wear my raincoat any more. I'm still
mil taking any chances, though. I bought a number of
new aloha shirts during Easter vacation, and I'm

changing them twice a day so that
I'll have a chance to wear all two
of -them.
Looking back into the deep,
deep past, as I recall, the last time
we had good weather was during
lin'uis last quarter, and now ol'
man sun pops up during midterms,
'flu-re just ain't no justice.
put I'm not complaining. I love

this weather (if it's ruining, forgot it). It's great to
get up in the middle of the night to hash breaklast
and find the sun, instead of having to stub my toes
petting off the sleeping porch.
This weather brings out the licst in women, too.
Such clothes. Even though they look like they've
slept in them, I like the flimsy things the girls wear,
especially those peekaslap blouses (one peek, and
nly girl slaps me).
/Wid another thing—Lake Lag. The weather's been
sol bad that the Lake's filled up and now it's going
down (or are the weeds growing taller these days?)

and I haven't been in yet. The last time I went up to
the Lake was for the Junior Water Carnival. Ah, the
Water Carnival —the one day in the year you can de
pend on a typhoon.
One thing I have discovered about this warm
weather, though, and the Psych Department should be
interested in it. Through much research it has come to
me that there is an inverse correlation between the
temperature and grades. Startling? 01 course, there
is a margin of error, but it can easily be explained.
No matter where you go, there are always those few
people who think it's healthier to read a book than to
he outside enjoying the sunshine.
They believe that if you digest a specified number
of books during a period of four years, you auto
matically become educated. Such naivete. A spring
quarter "A" means nothing, but a "C" during that
quarter at least shows you tried. It also shows you
aren't a bookworm.
The only thing I have against warm weather is that
it draws me to the beach, and I seem to have a bad
effect on beach weather. Every time I make the jour
ney beachward, what do you suppose 1 see? Nothing!
It's too foggy. I've even tried sneaking up on the
beach, but still no sun.
1 haven't given up. however. Next time 1 to the
beach. I'm taking a portable sun lamp.
