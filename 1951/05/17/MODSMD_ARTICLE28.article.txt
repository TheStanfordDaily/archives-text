## Asian Student Questions Stegner Speech 
### 
To the Editor:
Tuesday's well-delivered Lecture by Professor Wal
lace Stegner, "Literary Lessons Out of Asia, had only
one drawback —there was no question period.
The dark and dismal picture created by the speaker,
depicting the state of literature in Asia, was very
touching, but do you not :.ee a single I.right ray ol
hope, Dr. Stegner?
Speaking as an Asian, I find that all young Asians
are relatively very "literature-hungry.'' Not only arc
the local writers and authors widely read, Lut the
works ol the Western bards and sages devoured with
interest.-
The misunderstandings and the sus»i< ions that
exist—as pointed out by the speaker—between the
t and West can be understood duet t tin ignor
apee of the West about the social, cultural, and eco
nomic conditions present in the East. An Asian
kltfrws more about American and the West than an
/fcKerivan knows about China. India, and the East.
Screed, a part of our knowledge is being collected
Hollywood movies and another part from pocket
bojgks, but will you not agree, Dr. Stegner, that there
is w sincere effort on the part of every Asian to under
stand America and the West?
7"his is more than can be said for Americans. Ameri
cans, are quick at learning the facts and history of a

nation, only when they are at war with or against that
nation. If instead, this knowledge was collected under
normal conditions, a friendly tie would be bound to
grow up between the nations.
Organizations like SIKO and others are great on
paper—but if students take interest in thein only
during a SIKO Week, then the organizations do not
accomplish much.
May I take this opportunity to thank SIKO for their
wonderful work, and urge Stanford students fo take
more interest in such organizations? Let's hope the
New Delhi Affiliation starts a new movement. Then
maybe Dr. Stegner's picture will 'begin to change
color.
