### BOB BERNSTEIN 
When Bill McColl combines var
sity football chores with his first
year of med school next autumn, he
won't be the first Stanford gridder
| to attempt such double duty. Dave
I Brown, now a Navy doctor sta
tioned at Moffett Field, performed
the stunt buck in 194G. AND Brown
had to commute from San Fran
cisco to catch the practices.
Since first-year med students
take their work on the campus,
McColl will at least be spared that
inconvenience.

There ain't no justice department:
j Last Friduy against California, Kog
er Osenbaugh set a new CIBA rec
ord by walking 12 men in a single
game. On Saturday, Bob Murphy
of the Stanlords bettered (or
worsed) that mark by issuing 13
passes to the UCLA Bruins.

Next year's Big Game will feature
a 1:30 kickotV. Don't know for sure,
; but that should set some sort of
record for getting an early start.
Apparently, the Athletic Depart
ment feels that the fans need more
1 time for post-game celebrating.
The 1951 schedule reveals a
j couple of other interesting items:
1. Stanford will open its .season
away from home for the second
time in history when the gridders
journey to Portland for a Sept. 22
j engagement with the Oregon
Ducks. The last time it happened
was in 1940 (an omen, maybe?);
but that one was only as far away
as San Francisco where the In
dians met USF at Kezar.
2. All home games will start at
2 p.m. In past vears. the early
j season games were started at 2:150
to allow commuters a chance to
get back to Paly in time for the
| kitkoff. The new reasoning is ap
parently that nobody works oil
Saturday any more, anyway.

Phil Heraty, the contractor who is
now the boss of Maichie Schwartz,
told Stanford Buck of the Month
Clubbers this week that Maichie is
encouraged to take time off from
his duties to talk promising preps
into furthering their education at
Stanford.

You might as well learn the name
of Ted Tanner right now. The
husky Santa Kosa freshman is on
his way to being Stanford's best
linebacker, if spring showings mean
anything. Dutch Fehring has tabbed
Tanner as the outstanding defensive
prospect to be turned up during
spring drills.

1 time for post-game celebrating.
The 1951 schedule reveals a
j couple of other interesting items:
1. Stanford will open its .season
away from home for the second
time in history when the gridders
journey to Portland for a Sept. 22
j engagement with the Oregon
Ducks. The last time it happened
was in 1940 (an omen, maybe?);
but that one was only as far away
as San Francisco where the In
dians met USF at Kezar.
2. All home games will start at
2 p.m. In past vears. the early
j season games were started at 2:150
to allow commuters a chance to
get back to Paly in time for the
| kitkoff. The new reasoning is ap
parently that nobody works oil
Saturday any more, anyway.

Phil Heraty, the contractor who is
now the boss of Maichie Schwartz,
told Stanford Buck of the Month
Clubbers this week that Maichie is
encouraged to take time off from
his duties to talk promising preps
into furthering their education at
Stanford.

You might as well learn the name
of Ted Tanner right now. The
husky Santa Kosa freshman is on
his way to being Stanford's best
linebacker, if spring showings mean
anything. Dutch Fehring has tabbed
Tanner as the outstanding defensive
prospect to be turned up during
spring drills.
When Bill McColl combines var
sity football chores with his first
year of med school next autumn, he
won't be the first Stanford gridder
| to attempt such double duty. Dave
I Brown, now a Navy doctor sta
tioned at Moffett Field, performed
the stunt buck in 194G. AND Brown
had to commute from San Fran
cisco to catch the practices.
Since first-year med students
take their work on the campus,
McColl will at least be spared that
inconvenience.

There ain't no justice department:
j Last Friduy against California, Kog
er Osenbaugh set a new CIBA rec
ord by walking 12 men in a single
game. On Saturday, Bob Murphy
of the Stanlords bettered (or
worsed) that mark by issuing 13
passes to the UCLA Bruins.

Next year's Big Game will feature
a 1:30 kickotV. Don't know for sure,
; but that should set some sort of
record for getting an early start.
Apparently, the Athletic Depart
ment feels that the fans need more
