# Oarsmen Try for Upset Against Cal at Palo Alto
## 
### DEWEY HECHT 
California's strong varsity
crew invades the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor tomorrow morn
ing to take on a Stanford eight
which has been pointing for this
race since early winter work
outs. Start of the three-mile or
deal is 10:30.
This is the third encounter of the
year for the Bears and Indians. At
Newport., Cal won a 2,000 - motor
sprint by three lengths; last week's
Washington Regatta put the Cards
a few feet behind the Cal tiller.
This third grind will be a down-to
the-wire dash that may well end in
a Stanford victory. «
Parking Spacc
Parking space and a ship - to
s h ore loudspeaker arrangement
have been set up for spectators.
There wiil also lie ushers to direct
Ihe cars to the finish line, where
the best, view of the race is af
forded.
Competition is keen between the
two crows. Several of the men have
rowed against each other since
frpsh meets. Captain Jim Fifcr,
stroke, has raced C;d stroke Bill
Lo'orz for two years. Last year
Looiv. rowed JV behind Olympic
veteran Ian Turner, while Fifcr
paced the varsity shell. This season
renews their personal rivalry.
C'al Reserve
Crd's sprint has been the major
difference between the two shells
this year. At Washington, the Cards
led Cm 1 from the mile m;irk to the
2'/l'-mile post. The final quarter
mile gave the spectators a thrilling
finish. Exhibiting great reserve, Cal
jacked the bent, up to .*5f> and "came
by" Stanford for second placc.
This week Coach Jim Beggs has
been concentrating on high stroke
work, especially his sprint finishes.
Fifcr and Bob McGary, the No. 7
man and lone sophomore in the
boat, have been rolling up to the
high thirties, but Beggs is not yet
satisfied. More miles is the solution
he proposes.
New Oarsmen
Of the three new men who moved
into the first shell since Newport,
I la 1 Campen is probably most im
pressive. Big Hal ((> ft. 4 in.—210)
never rowed before this fall, when
lie weighed over 2.'!0. His consistent
work and rapid improvement gave
him a chance at No. 5 when Don
Craven, veteran from last year,
dropped out with pneumonia. At
No. 5, the "engine room" of the
shell, Campen generates a levia
than puddle.
Another addition, Chief Hcn
drickson, switched from a port po
sition to star hoard at mid-season,
where he handles the different
technique with no trouble. At No.
he pulls enough water to help
make the middle of the boat one


CARD COXSWAIN—Dave Herdman barks the orders to the
eight Indian oarsmen as they practice for tomorrow's Cal race.
This will be the first opportunity Stanford students will have to
see their crew in action.
