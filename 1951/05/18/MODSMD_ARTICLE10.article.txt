# Music Scintillates In Spring Show
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Judy Rudolph and her six
Ladies of loy slunk onto the
stage of Memorial Auditorium
last night, dead-panned their
way through "You Can't Mend
a Broken Heart (By Saying T'ni
Sorry')," and stopped the show
—if indeed a show that moved
as slowly as this one did could
be said to have been stopped.
In fact, "Who's Blue?" the show
of which we speak, was chiefly a
battle between Jack Ni.sbet's book
and Wally White's songs, the for
mer of which inspired mostly yawns
while the latter made a spotty first
night. audience sit up and listen.
While's Music
If Mr. White's music is sometimes
a bit reminiscent of a few other
songs wp'vo heard, we can only ask
what popular music isn't? "Now
That I've Found You" is a truly
beautiful love ballad, but the novelty
numbers arc oven better. "Fornis
Born is," "The Shaving Song," and
of course the wonderful "You Can't
Mend a Broken Heart" bring us Mr.
White's talent at its best.
The cast, as a whole, was as at
tractive as the cast of a musical
comedy ought to he. Beautiful
Betty Benson as Kate Scott needs
nothing besides those blonde tresses
to hold the audience in the palm of
her hand, except when George
Denny, up to his usual scene-steal
ing 1 ricks, yanks the show out of
her hands and runs off with it.
lien Campbell
Don Campbell, unfortunately,
doesn't fare so well. He seemed to
slip out of key and off beat a bit
too frequently, and perhaps Direc
tor John Moore should have shifted
Mr. Campbell's scenes to the ex
treme left or right so that his
glances at the orchestra conductor
wouldn't have been so obvious.

Sue Alter is very amusing as a
little nit-wit who is not too dumb,
however, to catch her man; and
Addyse Lane, as usual, has no
trouble at all in holding the au
dience's attention.
Special mention should go to Dick
Casler for his lavish sets and cos
tumes, particularly the latter, which
were as fine as any we've seen in a
long time.

PLIGHTING HIS TROTH- -Rock Campbell sings of his love
for Betty Benson in this romantic scene from the Spring Show,
"Who's Blue : " which continues its run tonight and tomorrow
in Memorial Auditorium.
Judy Rudolph and her six
Ladies of loy slunk onto the
stage of Memorial Auditorium
last night, dead-panned their
way through "You Can't Mend
a Broken Heart (By Saying T'ni
Sorry')," and stopped the show
—if indeed a show that moved
as slowly as this one did could
be said to have been stopped.
In fact, "Who's Blue?" the show
of which we speak, was chiefly a
battle between Jack Ni.sbet's book
and Wally White's songs, the for
mer of which inspired mostly yawns
while the latter made a spotty first
night. audience sit up and listen.
While's Music
If Mr. White's music is sometimes
a bit reminiscent of a few other
songs wp'vo heard, we can only ask
what popular music isn't? "Now
That I've Found You" is a truly
beautiful love ballad, but the novelty
numbers arc oven better. "Fornis
Born is," "The Shaving Song," and
of course the wonderful "You Can't
Mend a Broken Heart" bring us Mr.
White's talent at its best.
The cast, as a whole, was as at
tractive as the cast of a musical
comedy ought to he. Beautiful
Betty Benson as Kate Scott needs
nothing besides those blonde tresses
to hold the audience in the palm of
her hand, except when George
Denny, up to his usual scene-steal
ing 1 ricks, yanks the show out of
her hands and runs off with it.
lien Campbell
Don Campbell, unfortunately,
doesn't fare so well. He seemed to
slip out of key and off beat a bit
too frequently, and perhaps Direc
tor John Moore should have shifted
Mr. Campbell's scenes to the ex
treme left or right so that his
glances at the orchestra conductor
wouldn't have been so obvious.

Sue Alter is very amusing as a
little nit-wit who is not too dumb,
however, to catch her man; and
Addyse Lane, as usual, has no
trouble at all in holding the au
dience's attention.
Special mention should go to Dick
Casler for his lavish sets and cos
tumes, particularly the latter, which
were as fine as any we've seen in a
long time.
