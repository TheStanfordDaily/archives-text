# Why a STANFORD Education?
## 
### 
You go to Stanford -did you ever stop to
think why and what good it was doing you?
Did you ever wonder what makes this Uni
versity one of the better universities in the
country? Did you ever pause to look beyond
the 15 units you're carrying now and try to de
termine just how you're being educated and
perpaied in these four years for the next 40
or 50 years of your life.
University President J. Wallace Sterling will
attempt to answer such "what and whys" in his
address today, "Getting an Education at Stan
ford." In his speech, Dr. Sterling will explain
what sort of an education Stanford is providing
for its students, and what its students should
be getting from that education.
We'll leave it to the president to explain the
University's aims in pursuing a philosophy of a
liberal education —that's his department.
But we think it's our department and our

duty lo urge each student to take time out from
the rush of studies, paity-times, bull sessions,
and extra-curricular activities to find out just
where all the studies (and the party-time and
the bull sessions and the extra-curricular ac
tivities. which are just as much a part of a Stan
lord education) are taking him.
We think that one hour out of four years
would be well spent in learning just how the
rest of those four years are affecting each stu
dent's life. Besides, an understanding of the
over-all design of his education will enable a
student to take better advantage of that educa
tion.
So, before your four years, 180 units, and
$2,640 are gone, why not drop in to the Mem
Aud this morning at 11 and find out what a
Stanford education is doing for you. President
Sterling has provided the opportunity, the rest
is up to you. —8.8.
