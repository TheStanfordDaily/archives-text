### DICK KLEIN 
Lot's get on to the second installment on how to take
(the draft test. With General Hershey's (he's the head
of some big candy outfit, and it's a real good bar, too)
latest blast to the newspapers, it seems that these SS
(and that ain't the first initials for a summer cruise)
Aptitude Tests are really going to form some basis for
deferments.
We left off trying to understand the paragraph on
Einstein. Heck, supposedly only 15 men in the world
really understand the good Doctor, so why crowd the
field. Mark each question in that category "unanswer
able," plead innocent, and move on the next set of
queries.
There are always those huge sections which attempt
to discover if your vocabulary compares with Shake
speare's. The testing service is continually disap
pointed at not finding anyone with that vast a com
mand, but still they shoot the braintwisters at poor
examinees. Some examples:
DIRECTIONS: Thumbing through the dictionary
several days ago, we discovered that there are many
words in the English language which are quite simi
lar to words in other languages. Alsu there are
words ill the English language which are quite simi
lar to other words in the English language. Based on
these findings, select the numbered words below
which have a meaning as nearly the same as the key
capitalized words. Coinprendo?
7. FUNDAMENTAL: 1. biased, 2. superfluous, 3.
ridiculous, 4. dirty, 5. confused.
11. ROUGH: 1. smooth, 2. difficult, 3. Cul student,
4. silken. 5. seasick.
13. EXCOM: 1. convict, 2. trade union, 3. extermin
ate, 4. excommunicate, 5. mob.
(Answers to seven come 11 and other answers will
be found at the end.)
DIRECTIONS: In this set, two words which have
a certain relationship (and this is nothing dirty) to
each other are followed by five numbered pairs of
words. Understand the relationship and you'll re
place Dr. Kinsey. Pick the pair of words that has
the most similar relationship in comparison to the
first set.
14. CHEESE:: CRACKERS: 1. plums:: apricots, 2.
mashed :: potatoes, 3. steak :: hamburgers; 4. Wildroot
:: hair, 5. apples :: sauce.
15. FIELD :: FALLOW: 1. Stanford :: Museum, 2.
shovel :: pick, 3. worker :: unemployed, 4. home :: con
struction, 5. labor :: work.
The most interesting portion of the exam is that part
devoted to analyzing graphs and charts. It can be a
great sport, especially if you've had about 50 units of
econ. Perhaps a sample graph, followed by a com
plete explanation will be helpful.

DIRECTIONS: Questions 16—18 are based on the
graph above. Your answers should be based on the
information (?) given (?) in the graph and on any
related knowledge you conceal up top.
IC. What's the difference between 193G and 1944?
1. thirty-five beetles, 2. no beetles, 3. no differ
ence, 4. not sufficient data, 5. eight years.
17. How many beetles were produced in 1941?
1. too many, 2. not enough, 3. not sufficient data,
4. 44 tons, 5. 43.5 tons. .
18. What per cent of world beetle production was
done in Iceland during the war period?
1. I don't know, 2. don't care, 3. why, 4-17.3 per
cent, 5. not sufficient data.
It all adds up to a pretty comprehensive search into
an average student's aptitude. The big hitch is the
way the test is administered. The Honor Code is
chucked out the window; and tough guys, who must
be hiding from the Kefauver Committee, stand over
your shoulder and proctor. Not that proctoring is okay
in its place, but not on the Farm.
The answer sheet is also very complex and quite a
gimmick. You indicate your choice by filling in a
dotted area. One future Phi Bete decided to fill in all
the spaces. Needless to say, when his sheet was run
through the IBM machine, Princeton testing officials
became hysterical. No mistakes. He's wearing a uni
form now, and it isn't khaki.
It all boils down to being a pretty tough nut to
crack. No angles to figure out. Just get plenty of sleep
the night before, and I'll see you out at Rossott's next
Saturday afternoon when the whole deal blows over.

The answer sheet is also very complex and quite a
gimmick. You indicate your choice by filling in a

the spaces. Needless to say, when his sheet was run

It all boils down to being a pretty tough nut to

DIRECTIONS: Thumbing through the dictionary
several days ago, we discovered that there are many
words in the English language which are quite simi
lar to words in other languages. Alsu there are
words ill the English language which are quite simi
lar to other words in the English language. Based on
these findings, select the numbered words below
which have a meaning as nearly the same as the key
capitalized words. Coinprendo?
7. FUNDAMENTAL: 1. biased, 2. superfluous, 3.
ridiculous, 4. dirty, 5. confused.
11. ROUGH: 1. smooth, 2. difficult, 3. Cul student,
4. silken. 5. seasick.
13. EXCOM: 1. convict, 2. trade union, 3. extermin
ate, 4. excommunicate, 5. mob.
(Answers to seven come 11 and other answers will
be found at the end.)
DIRECTIONS: In this set, two words which have
a certain relationship (and this is nothing dirty) to
each other are followed by five numbered pairs of
words. Understand the relationship and you'll re
place Dr. Kinsey. Pick the pair of words that has
the most similar relationship in comparison to the
first set.
14. CHEESE:: CRACKERS: 1. plums:: apricots, 2.
mashed :: potatoes, 3. steak :: hamburgers; 4. Wildroot
:: hair, 5. apples :: sauce.
15. FIELD :: FALLOW: 1. Stanford :: Museum, 2.
shovel :: pick, 3. worker :: unemployed, 4. home :: con
struction, 5. labor :: work.
The most interesting portion of the exam is that part
devoted to analyzing graphs and charts. It can be a
great sport, especially if you've had about 50 units of
econ. Perhaps a sample graph, followed by a com
plete explanation will be helpful.

DIRECTIONS: Questions 16—18 are based on the
graph above. Your answers should be based on the
information (?) given (?) in the graph and on any
related knowledge you conceal up top.
IC. What's the difference between 193G and 1944?
1. thirty-five beetles, 2. no beetles, 3. no differ
ence, 4. not sufficient data, 5. eight years.
17. How many beetles were produced in 1941?
1. too many, 2. not enough, 3. not sufficient data,
4. 44 tons, 5. 43.5 tons. .
18. What per cent of world beetle production was
done in Iceland during the war period?
1. I don't know, 2. don't care, 3. why, 4-17.3 per
cent, 5. not sufficient data.
It all adds up to a pretty comprehensive search into
an average student's aptitude. The big hitch is the

ence, 4. not sufficient data, 5. eight years.
17. How many beetles were produced in 1941?
1. too many, 2. not enough, 3. not sufficient data,
4. 44 tons, 5. 43.5 tons. .
18. What per cent of world beetle production was
done in Iceland during the war period?
1. I don't know, 2. don't care, 3. why, 4-17.3 per
cent, 5. not sufficient data.
It all adds up to a pretty comprehensive search into
an average student's aptitude. The big hitch is the
way the test is administered. The Honor Code is
chucked out the window; and tough guys, who must
be hiding from the Kefauver Committee, stand over
your shoulder and proctor. Not that proctoring is okay
in its place, but not on the Farm.
The answer sheet is also very complex and quite a
gimmick. You indicate your choice by filling in a
dotted area. One future Phi Bete decided to fill in all
the spaces. Needless to say, when his sheet was run
through the IBM machine, Princeton testing officials
became hysterical. No mistakes. He's wearing a uni
form now, and it isn't khaki.
It all boils down to being a pretty tough nut to
crack. No angles to figure out. Just get plenty of sleep
the night before, and I'll see you out at Rossott's next
Saturday afternoon when the whole deal blows over.

Lot's get on to the second installment on how to take
(the draft test. With General Hershey's (he's the head
of some big candy outfit, and it's a real good bar, too)
latest blast to the newspapers, it seems that these SS
(and that ain't the first initials for a summer cruise)
Aptitude Tests are really going to form some basis for
deferments.
We left off trying to understand the paragraph on
Einstein. Heck, supposedly only 15 men in the world
really understand the good Doctor, so why crowd the
field. Mark each question in that category "unanswer
able," plead innocent, and move on the next set of
queries.
There are always those huge sections which attempt
to discover if your vocabulary compares with Shake
speare's. The testing service is continually disap
pointed at not finding anyone with that vast a com
mand, but still they shoot the braintwisters at poor
examinees. Some examples:
DIRECTIONS: Thumbing through the dictionary
several days ago, we discovered that there are many
words in the English language which are quite simi
lar to words in other languages. Alsu there are
words ill the English language which are quite simi
lar to other words in the English language. Based on
these findings, select the numbered words below
which have a meaning as nearly the same as the key
capitalized words. Coinprendo?
7. FUNDAMENTAL: 1. biased, 2. superfluous, 3.
ridiculous, 4. dirty, 5. confused.
11. ROUGH: 1. smooth, 2. difficult, 3. Cul student,
4. silken. 5. seasick.
13. EXCOM: 1. convict, 2. trade union, 3. extermin
ate, 4. excommunicate, 5. mob.
(Answers to seven come 11 and other answers will
be found at the end.)
DIRECTIONS: In this set, two words which have
a certain relationship (and this is nothing dirty) to
each other are followed by five numbered pairs of
words. Understand the relationship and you'll re
place Dr. Kinsey. Pick the pair of words that has
the most similar relationship in comparison to the
first set.
14. CHEESE:: CRACKERS: 1. plums:: apricots, 2.
mashed :: potatoes, 3. steak :: hamburgers; 4. Wildroot
:: hair, 5. apples :: sauce.
15. FIELD :: FALLOW: 1. Stanford :: Museum, 2.
shovel :: pick, 3. worker :: unemployed, 4. home :: con
struction, 5. labor :: work.
The most interesting portion of the exam is that part
devoted to analyzing graphs and charts. It can be a
great sport, especially if you've had about 50 units of
econ. Perhaps a sample graph, followed by a com
plete explanation will be helpful.

DIRECTIONS: Questions 16—18 are based on the
graph above. Your answers should be based on the
information (?) given (?) in the graph and on any
related knowledge you conceal up top.
