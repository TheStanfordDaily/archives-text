# Leaders' Conference Planned; Past Program's Success Told
## 
### 
The Student Leadership Conference last year was so successful
that it may well become an annual affair, according to Student
Body President Ted Buttner.
The second Student Leadership Conference will be held next
Tuesday from 3:30 to 5:30 and from 7 to 10 p.m. in Room 2 of the

Education Building.
This year's program is restricted
to one day, Buttner said, instead of
two days as was the case for last
year's conference.
Buttner and Lyons
Muster of ceremonies will be
Buttner in the afternoon and Jo
Lyons, ASSU vice-president, for the
evening sessions.
Dr. Harry J. Rathbun, professor
of law, will deliver the keynote ad
dress at the afternoon session on
"The Philosophy of Student Lead
ership."
He will be followed by Dave El
liott, ASSU business manager,
speaking on "Financing Student
Government"; Dr. Helen W. Schra
der, assistant professor of speech
and drama, and education, speaking
on "Leading Group Discussions";
and Gordon Addison, public rela
tions director, speaking on "Public-
Relations."
Talk on Interviewing
The evening session will begin
with a talk by Dr. John A. Willits,
associate professor of psychology,
on "Principles of Interviewing."
He will be followed by Buttner
speaking on "The Organization of
Student Activities."
Next the conference will break up
into lour panel discussion groups.
Phil Nielsen will head the panel dis
cussion on "Administration," Row
land Rebele on "The Daily," Harry
Rowe on "Representation," and Ted
Hinshaw on "Student Attitude."
Final Plenary
A plenary session, followed by
refreshments, will wind up the con
ference.
Conference planners are Sue
Dekker and Ted Fleischer of Excom
and Kay Wold of Cardinals.
Carol Folsom is refreshment
chairman.
Another innovation in this year's
conference is holding it on a week
day instead of over the weekend.
Buttner said a midweek program is
more convenient for the students.
Purpose of the conference, which
is open to the whole campus, is to
acquaint student leaders and other
interested students with leadership
techniques, and to allow leaders of
campus organizations an opportu
nity tm meet each other, exchange
ideas, and discuss campus prob
lems.
The conference is presented by
the ASSU and is directed by Excom
and Cardinals.
