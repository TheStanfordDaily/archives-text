# Green for Alums, And at Least One Person's Grateful

### BILL STOLTZE 
It was a year ago Wednesday—
May 10, 1950—when a student came
up to "a little old ladv pulling
weeds and thistles from along side
the History corner of the Quad"
and asked her why she was doing it.
"I just couldn't bear having the
old-timers come back to Stanford
and see these conditions," she told
him.
"The class of 1900 will be here
Saturday for their golden anniver
sary. How would it look to them
to see these weeds sticking up here
—right in front of the Library for
everybody to see?"
Pulled Weeds
The 4-foot 11-inch member of
the pioneer class fo 1894 had been
pulling up giant weeds and thistles
that were taller than she. As she
turned back to her task her cheer
ful comment was, "Somebody had to
do it, you know."
A few days ago this same little
old lady marched into the Daily
Shack beaming with joy, and but
tonholed the first staff member she
happened to spy.
'Do you think you could print a
little story for me?" she said.
To "Biz Side"?
I was about to refer her to "the
biz side" for a classified ad, when
something about the expression in
her face made me stop and ask,
"Why, what did you want?"
She asked me if I remembered
the story about the little old lady
pulling weeds in last year's Daily
and I nodded. "Well, I'm that little
old lady," she said, "and I wish
you'd print a little story thanking
the Buildings and Grounds Depart
ment, for doing the job this year.
Nice and Green
"They're picking out the stones,
pulling the weeds, and planting new
grass so it will be nice and green
for May 19, when the alumni come.
There'll be pretty green shoots after
the first shower."
She refused to tell me her name
because she didn't "want any pub
licity."
I promised to do my best to have
the story printed.
