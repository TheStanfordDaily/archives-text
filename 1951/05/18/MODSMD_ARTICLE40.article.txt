# Indian Nine Closes Season With Cal
## 5 Seniors In Last Tilt 
### JOHN HERBOLD 
The Berkeley Baseball Bear
went over the mountain, and
what do you think he saw-
He saw another Indian, he
saw another Indian, and he's
probably glad that tomorrow's
game on the local hunting
grounds will be the last time
he'll see one, at least for 1950.
Post time is 2:30 for this, game
which rings clown the curtain on
the Stanford varsity season.
So far this year the Tribesmen
have made mincemeat out of the
invaders in two of their three out
ings, and tomorrow they'll be
shooting for the series clincher. But
that's not all, since a win against
Clint Evans' boys will give the
Cards an even .500 record (8 and 8)
in the CIBA and assure them of
third place over Cal, which can tie
them for that spot should they deci
sion the Cards.
Couch Everett Dean will use
pitchers Joe Chez or Rog Osen
baugh, both of whom have shown
during the last two years that
they're not the least bit afraid of
the Big Bad Bear. In all probabil
ity they'll be faced by right-hander
Bill Nishita, Hawaii's gift to base
ball.
In tin* Stanford lineup will be
seniors Dick Clegg, Bruce Cam
eron, and Tom Shaw, who will be
playing thir final game for Stai
fovd. Others to wear the Cardi
nal uniform for the last time in
clude catcher Bill Herron, first
baseman Jim Castaftnoli, and
pitcher Jim Claypool. Castagnoli
will not play tomorrow because of
illness, hut llerron is expected to
do some catching. Claypool is the
number one relief man. and re
ceived credit for the last win over
(he Bears.
Said Coach Dean regarding his
graduating veterans, "Our seniors,
who never lost their spirit nor let
up in their efforts toward a repeat
CIBA pennant win, will definitely
be missed next year. Such fine col
lege performers will be most diffi
cult to replace."
Stanford's revised batting order,
which has proved very successful of
late, will be used against Cal.
Power stacked down the middle
with Dick Clegg, Jack Shepard, and
Jim Agar, all nine positions are
bandied by adequate batsmen.
