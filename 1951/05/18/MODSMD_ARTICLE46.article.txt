# Stern V Nips Stern I, 8 to 3
## 
### DON GILLIN 
It was a case of too little and too I
late yesterday as pitcher Jim Mc-
VVilliams led his undefeated Stern
V teammates to an 8 to 3 victory
aver Stern I in a regular intramural
softball game. The Stern I batters
had for too little in the early in
nings and were far too late when
they did begin to rally.
Me Williams, was both an offen
sive star for the Stern V club.
Although his one-hit shutout evap
orated during" a Stern I rally in
the sixth inning, his three hits ac
counted for four of his team's eight
runs. Altogether he gave out but
three hits, while striking out seven
enemy batters.
Stern V collected three of their
14 hits in the second inning, only
to have all three runners nipped on
the base lines by alert Stern I field
ing. Not to be denied, they came
back for three runs in the third on
singles by Doug Heller and Jim Mc-
Williams and a double by Ollie
Norville. Two more digits were
added in the fourth and fifth with
Heller and Glikbarg leading the at
tack. In the sixth Heller and Mc-
Williams again combined their tal
ents to grab the three final tallies.
Stern I hitters, previously baf
fled by McWilliams' low. fast ball,
suddenly found the formula in the
last half of the sixth. Putting to
gether a single, a double, and two
walks, they collected thre runs, only
to see their hopes vanish when
a Stern V fielder snagged a pop fly
for the final out.
Other games were characterized
by a surplus of forfeitures. Encina

Center began festivities by failing i
to show up for its contest with En- i
cina 2E. Chi Psi and Encina 2W j
followed the trend by bowing si- j
lently to Business School I and En
cina 2W, respectively, only to find
their records bested by Village '214
and Encina Basement which for
feited to each other.
In the more active contests, Theta I
Xi I defeated Alpha Sig I by a score
of G to 1; Ravenswood out-hit I
Crothers Hall 5 to 1; and Business 1
School II edged the Newman Club 1
5 to 3.

V teammates to an 8 to 3 victory
aver Stern I in a regular intramural
softball game. The Stern I batters
had for too little in the early in
nings and were far too late when
they did begin to rally.
Me Williams, was both an offen
sive star for the Stern V club.
Although his one-hit shutout evap
orated during" a Stern I rally in
the sixth inning, his three hits ac
counted for four of his team's eight
runs. Altogether he gave out but
three hits, while striking out seven
enemy batters.
Stern V collected three of their
14 hits in the second inning, only
to have all three runners nipped on
the base lines by alert Stern I field
ing. Not to be denied, they came
back for three runs in the third on
singles by Doug Heller and Jim Mc-
Williams and a double by Ollie
Norville. Two more digits were
added in the fourth and fifth with
Heller and Glikbarg leading the at
tack. In the sixth Heller and Mc-
Williams again combined their tal
ents to grab the three final tallies.
Stern I hitters, previously baf
fled by McWilliams' low. fast ball,
suddenly found the formula in the
last half of the sixth. Putting to
gether a single, a double, and two
walks, they collected thre runs, only
to see their hopes vanish when
a Stern V fielder snagged a pop fly
for the final out.
Other games were characterized
by a surplus of forfeitures. Encina

Center began festivities by failing i
to show up for its contest with En- i
cina 2E. Chi Psi and Encina 2W j
followed the trend by bowing si- j
lently to Business School I and En
cina 2W, respectively, only to find
their records bested by Village '214
and Encina Basement which for
feited to each other.
In the more active contests, Theta I
Xi I defeated Alpha Sig I by a score
of G to 1; Ravenswood out-hit I
Crothers Hall 5 to 1; and Business 1
School II edged the Newman Club 1
5 to 3.
