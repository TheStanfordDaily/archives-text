# Want to Find a Parking Place? Sorry, You're 50 Years Too Late
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Do you remember how an
noyed you were the morning
you rolled onto campus, late for
your 8 o'clock, and couldn't find
a parking place?
Stanford has not always had
a parking problem. In fact, 52
years ago, there were no cars
here at all.
At that time, in 18!K), W. L. El
: liot of Oakland, accompanied by Dr.
| David Starr Jordan, then president
! of Stanford, made a trial run in a
i home-made horseless carriage.
The trip, from San Jose to the
I top of Mt. Hamilton 2G miles away,
i was made in a sensational five hours
j and 20 minutes.
After that, things happened fast.
Mrs. Lcland Stanford, who opposed
automobiles because they kicked up
too much dust, scared horses, and
gave ofT unsavory fumes, found
herself fighting a losing battle.
Car Number One
Dr. John Pearce Mitchell, rcgis
: trar and professor of chemistry,
emeritus, recalls that soon alter the
turn of the century Dr. Wilder, the
campus M.D., was permitted to
drive to and from his home, which
was near the present post office.
He practically had to sneak in,
however, via a special back en
trance on Mayfield.
In 1905 a sign was posted at the
head of Palm Drive warning motor
ists to keep out. But that same
year 200 cars took advantage of a
special relaxation in the rules which
allowed them, within severely im
posed limits, to drive onto the cam
pus for the Big Game.
Total Soars
By 1907 the number of automo
biles had surged out of control, and
the University had no alternative
but to allow motorists to bring their
vehicles onto the Stanford grounds.
Even so, most roads were still
closed to them, and two fraternities
were refused permits to park be
fore their houses on Salvaticrra
Street.
The following year the Board of
Trustees, grim but open-minded in
the face of the unavoidable, opened
the campus to automobiles, "sub
ject to the usual speed limit of 10
miles an hour."
Palm Drive Closed
This resolution threw open all
I University streets, alleys, and lanes,
j except Palm Drive, which was, in
j accordance with Mrs. Stanford's
j wish, to be reserved forever for
horses and carriages alone.
By 1012, however, carriages were
i almost extinct, and in 1916 even
Palm Drive was opened to automo
biles, thus officially ending one era
| and inaugurating another.
Nevertheless, car owners were
i still in for trouble. In 192!> a reso
lution was put before the student
! body which, had it passed, would
have forbidden undergraduates to
| have cars on campus.
17(5 "Heroes"
An Illustrated Alumni Review of
that year despairingly reported the
resolution's defeat, though it man
need to find some hope for the
world's future in the 47(5 brave, lev
el-headed souls who voted for re
! strict,ion.
I But automobiles had triumphed

and their victory was never again
seriously challenged. Their num
bers increased through the years,
all of which brings us up to the
present situation — ''just too many
cars," as Chief Davis puts it.
Where to Park?
If you own a car —and four and
a half thousand Stanford students,
faculty members, and employees do
— you probably have experienced
many times the frustration of find
ing no place to park.
Perhaps, in desperation, you fi
nally parked in a reserved or re
stricted area, hoping you wouldn't
get caught.
The sequel to that little hope,
most likely, was a trip to Police
Chief Gordon Davis' office to pay
oIT your $2 fine.
Bulletin Tells How
It's a problem, this parking situa
tion, but something IS being done
about it. The latest effort to alle
viate the problem is an ASSU bulle
tin on the subject of parking at
Stanford which, along with a map
outlining parking areas, may now
be secured at Chief Davis' office in
the Corporation Yard.
The bulletin, for which the ASSU
appropriated $60, was drawn up by
Excom member Gordon Campbell,
and deals with registration certifi
cate rules, restricted and reserved
areas, fines, future development,
and suggestions.
Watch and Obey
The bulletin boils down to this:
Watch and obey the signs.
Green, red, and white signs mark
the 200 spaces reserved for the fac
ulty and physically handicapped,
and the limited or no - parking
/.ones. White curbings mean pas

senger discharge or loading zones
ONLY.
The Planning Office is working
for the establishment of more park
ing areas. The largest of these will
be a lot between the new eating
club building and Arguello.
A Few Suggestions
But until these new areas arc
ready, the ASSU bulletin suggests
the following:

1. Park carefully to save space.
2. Walk to school if you live on
campus.
3. Utilize the Chemistry and the
Health Service lots, which are sel
dom filled to capacity.
The automobile is here to stay.
Get a copy of the ASSU bulletin at
Chief Davis' office, learn the do's
and don'ts, and try not to regret the
passing of horse-and-bugcy days.

Watch and Obey
The bulletin boils down to this:
Watch and obey the signs.
Green, red, and white signs mark
the 200 spaces reserved for the fac
ulty and physically handicapped,
and the limited or no - parking
/.ones. White curbings mean pas

senger discharge or loading zones
ONLY.
The Planning Office is working
for the establishment of more park
ing areas. The largest of these will
be a lot between the new eating
club building and Arguello.
A Few Suggestions
But until these new areas arc
ready, the ASSU bulletin suggests
the following:

1. Park carefully to save space.
2. Walk to school if you live on
campus.
3. Utilize the Chemistry and the
Health Service lots, which are sel
dom filled to capacity.
The automobile is here to stay.
Get a copy of the ASSU bulletin at
Chief Davis' office, learn the do's
and don'ts, and try not to regret the
passing of horse-and-bugcy days.
Do you remember how an
noyed you were the morning
you rolled onto campus, late for
your 8 o'clock, and couldn't find
a parking place?
Stanford has not always had
a parking problem. In fact, 52
years ago, there were no cars
here at all.
At that time, in 18!K), W. L. El
: liot of Oakland, accompanied by Dr.
| David Starr Jordan, then president
! of Stanford, made a trial run in a
i home-made horseless carriage.
The trip, from San Jose to the
I top of Mt. Hamilton 2G miles away,
i was made in a sensational five hours
j and 20 minutes.
After that, things happened fast.
Mrs. Lcland Stanford, who opposed
automobiles because they kicked up
too much dust, scared horses, and
gave ofT unsavory fumes, found
herself fighting a losing battle.
Car Number One
Dr. John Pearce Mitchell, rcgis
: trar and professor of chemistry,
emeritus, recalls that soon alter the
turn of the century Dr. Wilder, the
campus M.D., was permitted to
drive to and from his home, which
was near the present post office.
He practically had to sneak in,
however, via a special back en
trance on Mayfield.
In 1905 a sign was posted at the
head of Palm Drive warning motor
ists to keep out. But that same
year 200 cars took advantage of a
special relaxation in the rules which
allowed them, within severely im
posed limits, to drive onto the cam
pus for the Big Game.
Total Soars
By 1907 the number of automo
biles had surged out of control, and
the University had no alternative
but to allow motorists to bring their
vehicles onto the Stanford grounds.
Even so, most roads were still
closed to them, and two fraternities
were refused permits to park be
fore their houses on Salvaticrra
Street.
The following year the Board of
Trustees, grim but open-minded in
the face of the unavoidable, opened
the campus to automobiles, "sub
ject to the usual speed limit of 10
miles an hour."
Palm Drive Closed
This resolution threw open all
I University streets, alleys, and lanes,
j except Palm Drive, which was, in
j accordance with Mrs. Stanford's
j wish, to be reserved forever for
horses and carriages alone.
By 1012, however, carriages were
i almost extinct, and in 1916 even
Palm Drive was opened to automo
biles, thus officially ending one era
| and inaugurating another.
Nevertheless, car owners were
i still in for trouble. In 192!> a reso
lution was put before the student
! body which, had it passed, would
have forbidden undergraduates to
| have cars on campus.
17(5 "Heroes"
An Illustrated Alumni Review of
that year despairingly reported the
resolution's defeat, though it man
need to find some hope for the
world's future in the 47(5 brave, lev
el-headed souls who voted for re
! strict,ion.
I But automobiles had triumphed

and their victory was never again
seriously challenged. Their num
bers increased through the years,
all of which brings us up to the
present situation — ''just too many
cars," as Chief Davis puts it.
Where to Park?
If you own a car —and four and
a half thousand Stanford students,
faculty members, and employees do
— you probably have experienced
many times the frustration of find
ing no place to park.
Perhaps, in desperation, you fi
nally parked in a reserved or re
stricted area, hoping you wouldn't
get caught.
The sequel to that little hope,
most likely, was a trip to Police
Chief Gordon Davis' office to pay
oIT your $2 fine.

bers increased through the years,
all of which brings us up to the
present situation — ''just too many
cars," as Chief Davis puts it.
Where to Park?
If you own a car —and four and
a half thousand Stanford students,
faculty members, and employees do
— you probably have experienced
many times the frustration of find
ing no place to park.
Perhaps, in desperation, you fi
nally parked in a reserved or re
stricted area, hoping you wouldn't
get caught.
The sequel to that little hope,
most likely, was a trip to Police
Chief Gordon Davis' office to pay
oIT your $2 fine.
Bulletin Tells How
It's a problem, this parking situa
tion, but something IS being done
about it. The latest effort to alle
viate the problem is an ASSU bulle
tin on the subject of parking at
Stanford which, along with a map
outlining parking areas, may now
be secured at Chief Davis' office in
the Corporation Yard.
The bulletin, for which the ASSU
appropriated $60, was drawn up by
Excom member Gordon Campbell,
and deals with registration certifi
cate rules, restricted and reserved
areas, fines, future development,
and suggestions.
Watch and Obey
The bulletin boils down to this:
Watch and obey the signs.
Green, red, and white signs mark
the 200 spaces reserved for the fac
ulty and physically handicapped,
and the limited or no - parking
/.ones. White curbings mean pas

senger discharge or loading zones
ONLY.
The Planning Office is working
for the establishment of more park
ing areas. The largest of these will
be a lot between the new eating
club building and Arguello.
A Few Suggestions
But until these new areas arc
ready, the ASSU bulletin suggests
the following:

1. Park carefully to save space.
2. Walk to school if you live on
campus.
3. Utilize the Chemistry and the
Health Service lots, which are sel
dom filled to capacity.
The automobile is here to stay.
Get a copy of the ASSU bulletin at
Chief Davis' office, learn the do's
and don'ts, and try not to regret the
passing of horse-and-bugcy days.
Do you remember how an
noyed you were the morning
you rolled onto campus, late for
your 8 o'clock, and couldn't find
a parking place?
Stanford has not always had
a parking problem. In fact, 52
years ago, there were no cars
here at all.
At that time, in 18!K), W. L. El
: liot of Oakland, accompanied by Dr.
| David Starr Jordan, then president
! of Stanford, made a trial run in a
i home-made horseless carriage.
The trip, from San Jose to the
I top of Mt. Hamilton 2G miles away,
i was made in a sensational five hours
j and 20 minutes.
After that, things happened fast.
Mrs. Lcland Stanford, who opposed
automobiles because they kicked up
too much dust, scared horses, and
gave ofT unsavory fumes, found
herself fighting a losing battle.
Car Number One
Dr. John Pearce Mitchell, rcgis
: trar and professor of chemistry,
emeritus, recalls that soon alter the
turn of the century Dr. Wilder, the
campus M.D., was permitted to
drive to and from his home, which
was near the present post office.
He practically had to sneak in,
however, via a special back en
trance on Mayfield.
In 1905 a sign was posted at the
head of Palm Drive warning motor
ists to keep out. But that same
year 200 cars took advantage of a
special relaxation in the rules which
allowed them, within severely im
posed limits, to drive onto the cam
pus for the Big Game.
Total Soars
By 1907 the number of automo
biles had surged out of control, and
the University had no alternative
but to allow motorists to bring their
vehicles onto the Stanford grounds.
Even so, most roads were still
closed to them, and two fraternities
were refused permits to park be
fore their houses on Salvaticrra
Street.
The following year the Board of
Trustees, grim but open-minded in
the face of the unavoidable, opened
the campus to automobiles, "sub
ject to the usual speed limit of 10
miles an hour."
Palm Drive Closed
This resolution threw open all
I University streets, alleys, and lanes,
j except Palm Drive, which was, in
j accordance with Mrs. Stanford's
j wish, to be reserved forever for
horses and carriages alone.
By 1012, however, carriages were
i almost extinct, and in 1916 even
Palm Drive was opened to automo
biles, thus officially ending one era
| and inaugurating another.
Nevertheless, car owners were
i still in for trouble. In 192!> a reso
lution was put before the student
! body which, had it passed, would
have forbidden undergraduates to
| have cars on campus.
17(5 "Heroes"
An Illustrated Alumni Review of
that year despairingly reported the
resolution's defeat, though it man
need to find some hope for the
world's future in the 47(5 brave, lev
el-headed souls who voted for re
! strict,ion.

and their victory was never again
