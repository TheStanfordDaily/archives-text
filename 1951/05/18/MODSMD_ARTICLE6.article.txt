# Draft Option Still Up To Local Boards
## 
### 
Local selective service boards
have final authority to defer col
lege students on the basis of the
Selective Service College Quali
fication Test, on the basis of
class standing, or both of these
factors, Richard L. Balch, chief
counselor for men, said yester
day.
Commonting on yesterday's United
Press draft story carried in the Daily,
Balch said draft laws which are cur
rently in rfToct give authority to the
local boards.

The deadline for applying to lake
the Selcctivc Scrvice College Qual
ification Test has been extended to
May 25, according to selective
service information received yes
terday by Richard 1.. Raich, chief
counselor for men.
Raich urged draft-vulnerable men
who have not yet applied to take
the test to report to his office.

Yesterday's story said "local boards
will defer all students who get a
qualifying test score in the test or
who are in the upper part of their
class."
Balch cave three sources to back
np his opinion that local boards' still
had authority.
1. Mrs. Lillian Kricghaum, head
of the San Jose Selcctivc Service
Board.
2. The American Council on Krf
ucatinn.
3. News stories circulated in San
Francisco newspapers yesterday.
All three sources stated local
boards had final authority in inter
preting and applying student draft
deferment criteria.
Balch also said students who have
not received 1-A classifications need
not send evidence of class standing to
their local boards.
This evidence should be furnished
upon request of the board or upon the
receipt of 1-A classification, Balch
said.
Local boards have been ordered to
postpone induction of college stu
dents until results of their deferment
tests are known. No inductions will
be postponed for this reason beyond
Aue. 20.
A letter and card have been sent
by the counselor's office to all stu
dents who indicated they intended
to return next autumn and who
were draft vulnerable according to
the military status cards filled out
during winter quarter registration.
Balch said students who fall into
this category but haven't received the
letter and card by next Monday
should report to his office.
Students intending to finish study
for a degree by the end of the sum
mer session should report to Belch's
office unless they have already made
arrangements with their local boards
to finish their education.
