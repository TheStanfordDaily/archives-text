## Allied Troops Take Initiative in West 
### 
TOKYO. Monday, May 21 (UP)â€”
Confident Allied troops seized the
initiative Sunday from the Chinese
on the west and west ecntral Ko
rean fronts and sent powerful Com
munist - killing tank expeditions
ranging as far as 10 miles ahead of
(heir own lines.
The forays by the cocky troops
of the United Nations Eighth Army
caught the Chinese by surprise and
at. one point two Yank units fought
their way through attacking Chi
nese before they could begin their
own killer tactics behind the en
emy lines.
The Chinese offensive had bogged
down for the moment under the
staggering weight of 48,000 casual
ties, but on the embattled east cen
tral front the Reds were still throw
ing desperation punches.
