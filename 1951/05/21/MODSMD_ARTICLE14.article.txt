A criticism of the MaeArthur af
fair by Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, pro
fessor of history, highlighted thr
IHtli Annual Stanford Campus
Alumni Conference held here Sat
urday.
In t.he opening lecture of the con
ference, which was attended by
nearly 1,000 alumni, Dr. Bailey rlc
elarcd that "the current investiga
tion Has diverted public wrath from
the low moral tone of the Truman
administration; it has added to pub-
He confusion; it has divided our
people sharply; and it has spilled a
lot of secrets."
'"The public discussion has clari
fied our thinking as to why we arc
in Korea," he said. "We have shown
the soundness of our democratic
processes by open discussion. And
wc have probably confused the
Kremlin worse than ourselves by
the reams of conflicting testimony,'"
he went on to say.
"It may take the Russians so lon a
to figure out what it is all about,
and what lies behind our open pa
rading of military secrets, that their
timo table of aggression will be set
back to our advantage."
