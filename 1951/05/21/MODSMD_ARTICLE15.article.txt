# Sterling Defends Modern Education at Stanford
## 
### BOB BATLIN 
Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling ex
pressed Stanford's philosophy
of a general education, related
the history of such education in
recent years, and voiced the
problem being presented by in
creasing college enrollments in
his address at Mem Aud Friday.
An audience of approximately 1,400
faculty and students gave- inc Uni
versity president a standing ovation
as he walked to the rostrum, and then
heard him explain the development
of modern education and defend
Stanford's pursuit of such an edu
cational course.
Dr. Sterling pointed out that gen
eral education was one step beyond a
liberal education in that it included
physical and biological sciences.
Under such a program, specialists
will be trained, but trained so that
they will have a general education.
"I believe the real justification for
the broad base provided b.v general
education is in providing the orien
tation . . . for the .student to serve
bis community, not only as a good
citizen, but as a person with special
training," the president stated.
Continuing on, Dr. Sterling stated,
"If training of the mind is to remain
a basic function of modern education,
it must have the minds to train, and
this justifies the careful selection of
students applying for a college edu
cation and the exacting of a high level
of performance while they arc in col
lege."
The University head, who had been
introduced by ASSU President Ted
Buttner as a "renowned scholar, ad
ministrator, and former athlete," said
that it has been necessary to dilute
the opportunity of close association
between students and faculty origi
nally established by Stanford's first
president, Dr. David Starr Jordan.
"However," the smiling execu
tive went on, "there is no hope for
improvement in college and uni
versity education in the United
States if one approaches the idea
with the resignation that education
is saddled by the necessity of lev
eling down performances because
of the number of students."
Dr. Sterling said that it has been
necessary to provide some uniformity
in training, but Stanford has at
tempted to prevent, students from
bring caught in what he called a
"lock-step" arrangement.
Impressive in his physical appear
ance and his informal delivery, Stan
ford's fifth president, said the faculty
currently has under consideration a
program for the revision of the Lower
Division curriculum which had been
set up "0 years ago.
I)r. Sterling reminded students,
"There is a direct correlation be
tween what the individual puts into
his education and what be gets out
of it. If this sounds trite or hack
neyed, it is only liccause it is axio
matic,"
The president, concluded his 30-
minute speech by saying, "In so far
as I have any influenco in this com
munity, there will still be a lot of
fun. a lot of hard work, and will
. till be a lot of high standards."

eling down performances because
of the number of students."
Dr. Sterling said that it has been
necessary to provide some uniformity
in training, but Stanford has at
tempted to prevent, students from
bring caught in what he called a
"lock-step" arrangement.
Impressive in his physical appear
ance and his informal delivery, Stan
ford's fifth president, said the faculty
currently has under consideration a
program for the revision of the Lower
Division curriculum which had been
set up "0 years ago.
I)r. Sterling reminded students,
"There is a direct correlation be
tween what the individual puts into
his education and what be gets out
of it. If this sounds trite or hack
neyed, it is only liccause it is axio
matic,"
The president, concluded his 30-
minute speech by saying, "In so far
as I have any influenco in this com
munity, there will still be a lot of
fun. a lot of hard work, and will
. till be a lot of high standards."


DR. J. E. WALLACE STERLING
—|"A general education"
Dr. J. E. Wallace Sterling ex
pressed Stanford's philosophy
of a general education, related
the history of such education in
recent years, and voiced the
problem being presented by in
creasing college enrollments in
his address at Mem Aud Friday.
An audience of approximately 1,400
faculty and students gave- inc Uni
versity president a standing ovation
as he walked to the rostrum, and then
heard him explain the development
of modern education and defend
Stanford's pursuit of such an edu
cational course.
Dr. Sterling pointed out that gen
eral education was one step beyond a
liberal education in that it included
physical and biological sciences.
Under such a program, specialists
will be trained, but trained so that
they will have a general education.
"I believe the real justification for
the broad base provided b.v general
education is in providing the orien
tation . . . for the .student to serve
bis community, not only as a good
citizen, but as a person with special
training," the president stated.
Continuing on, Dr. Sterling stated,
"If training of the mind is to remain
a basic function of modern education,
it must have the minds to train, and
this justifies the careful selection of
students applying for a college edu
cation and the exacting of a high level
of performance while they arc in col
lege."
The University head, who had been
introduced by ASSU President Ted
Buttner as a "renowned scholar, ad
ministrator, and former athlete," said
that it has been necessary to dilute
the opportunity of close association
between students and faculty origi
nally established by Stanford's first
president, Dr. David Starr Jordan.
"However," the smiling execu
tive went on, "there is no hope for
improvement in college and uni
versity education in the United
States if one approaches the idea
with the resignation that education
is saddled by the necessity of lev
eling down performances because
of the number of students."
Dr. Sterling said that it has been
