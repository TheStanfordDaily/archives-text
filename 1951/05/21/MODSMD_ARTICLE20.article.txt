# Frosh Oarsmen Break Cal Crew Jinx
## Yearlings Score Regatta Upset But Varsity, JV's Lose to Cal 
### Dy DEWEY HECHT 
Stanford's freshman oarsmen proudly collected T-shirts Salut
day morning after beating California across the finish line of a
| two-mile race. The frosh, who wore clocked al 10:37.4, won by
one-half length.
In other matches Cctl won easily. It was a disappointing morn

ing for Stanford's varsity and JV
crews, which fell behind the power
ful Ebright eight:; early in the races
and stayed there.
Some '1,000 observers saw the frosh
trim Cal. As a fog bank hazed the
water, the finish was all that could
be clearly seen. But. that was not
where the race was won.
The Papooses got off to about 10,
blades moiling the water to get mo
mentum. For the first , r >ft strokes
the two shells were almost together.
At about the half-mile mark, row
ing with great power and faultless
synchronization, the frosh began to
"go by" Cal.
Stroke Bill Fendlay, showing beau
tiful form and timing, stretched his
long pull-through out to give the boat
added lift at the mile mark. The beat
dropped to 27V2■ Moving on rhythm
and easy power, the frosh stayed with
their tiller on Cal's bow. pacing the
blue-and-gold rivals. Cal's beat was
about a 30 through the body of the
race.
The last dash to wire saw the
famed Cal sprint. Dolliver worked
up to 3.*H<2 for his final bid. Fendlay,
still rowing long, finished about a 33.
And in the first Stanford-Cal race
since the Farm's rowing renais
sance, a red-trunked coxswain
"took a dive."
For his boys, Coach Bob White
(himself a former Cal cox) had noth
ing but praise. ' We worked all week
011 getting the stroke down after the
start," he said. "I knew the boat had
a better race in it than the one they
turned in at Seattle."
Head Coach Jim Beggs was pleased
with the frosh race, but could not
find comfort there for his poor varsity
and JV showings.
Members of the first shell were dis
gruntled at their performance. Jim
Fifer, stroke and captain, said the ex
treme difference in times and large
margins between the two varsities
was the result of an exceptional race
by Cal and a poor race by Stanford.
"We can row bettor than that,"
said Have Hodman, varsity cox. "I
hope nobody thinks wc let down
after the Seattle race; we were too
tight for this one. We'll try to make
it up at Marietta."
Cal and Stanford started off evenly
in the varsity race, both boats a little
over 40. Fifer, after gaining an early
lead, dropprd bis stroke down to a 30,
and Cal, rowing two beats higher,
began to close the distance.
Winner's time over the three-mile
course was a fast 14:10.2. The Card
shell finished three lengths of open

water behind Cal; even their final
sprint did not close the gap.
Cal's smooth JVs easily won their
rare from a tiring Stanford sceond
boat. The first mile was contested
when the Cards, getting off fast,
pulled out a couple of men.
Cal's JV- rowing at. 31' •*. moved
to a three-quarter length advantage,
where they stayed fur the first half
mile; at this point, tlieir stroke
dropped to about 30. At tho three -
quarter-mile mark the Bears had
only a quarter-length lead.
Seemingly unable to stay ahead at
a low stroke. Ron Reuther, Cal pace
setter, went back to a3l where he
stayed the remainder of thr race.
At the finish Cal led by 2Vz length ;
of open water. Time was 10:58 lor
the victors.

I'i.OOO. The frosh win was the first for a Stanford crew over Cal since
the renewal of the sport on the Farm. —Photo by Jerry Schwab
