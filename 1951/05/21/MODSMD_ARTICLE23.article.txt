i Who knows? If you aw all three
performances of I;i■ I week Spring
I Show, you're probably a very
mixed-tip person.
Il seems that on T'nir;da\ night,
I I he unpredictable parrot Gabriel'
1 turned very, very blue. For that
matter, Gabc did the sain" thing on
Friday and Saturday.
But Thursday, Gnbriol was an
i ashamed parrot. Friday, he \v r n t.
In Thursday's show, little 1 i;cinda
(Su ie Alter) told her audience she
had taken pity on the talking bach
elor and inserted her own "little
girl parrot" in Gabriel's cage. It
seems Gabe got together with his
I female counterpart three times be
fore the "Fornis Bornis" chastity
test,
All of which meant that it was
I "blue Thursday" for Gabriel. And
the chastity test., which the towns

Mem Aud's Friday and Saturday
iiiklil assemblages were told a dif
ferent story. For Ihr s;«ke of "short
ening the ending," f<ueinda' "litt'r
ciri parrot" was given Uie nlrl
heave-ho, In other words, there
was no entente between the parrots.
Still, Gabriel turned blue, and it
was up to Chris Dawson (George
Denny) to toll his audienee that thr
Chinese roneoetors had mis-con
roeted hcrausr Gabe "had never
hern near" a littlr cirl parrot.
With all thr ado about parrots
chaste and unchaste, the show's
principals seemed to have no
trouble resolving their difficulties on
all nights — Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday.
All of which goes to show that
parrots -chaste or unchaste or both
don't seem to make much differ
ence anywav.
