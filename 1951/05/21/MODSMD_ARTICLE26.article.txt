### PETE GROTHE 
A Bull Sessioner always yets interesting fan mail.
Some ol the correspondence is too good for private
consumption, 'therefore we pass along to you the two
choicest fan letters that have come our way. When we
knocked out a piece on the Mac Arthur TV show, the
lollowing communique came from Los Angeles:
"Your parents must be proud indeed of your very
stupid and immature article oil General Mac Arthur
in the Daily. They must feel that the money spent
on your education is well spent."'
"You are such an inspiring example of young
America, in fact you are so good, that I suggest that
you go 1 ight over to No. 10 Downing Street to help
them formulate the policy of America -or better still
why aren't you in uniform doing your part instead of
making wisecracks and criticizing not only one of the
greatest generals and statesmen, but one of the great
est and most brilliant Americans of all time.
(Bull Sessioner's Note: This is fellow is long
winded. 'liie last sentence was XI words long.)
"No doubt you are too smart and need to be de
ferred so that when you are 71 you can wisely guide
your country in an hour ol need! Or are you an
American?
B. M. A."
(Note: The chicken didn't sign his name.)
Next comes a letter from Marvin O. Adams, the
country's most prolific letter-to- the-editor writer. In
reference to my statement "1 was walking down the
Quad, trying to figure out wbat Marvin O. Adams'
name meant spelled backwards," 1 received this letter:
"Sir!"
(Notice how he stalled off the letter vsith an ev-

clamalion point, which is really a period that has |
exploded.)
"Just what do you mean in this morning's Bull Ses
sion? And what does your name mean spelled back- !
wards? Perhaps you would like to explain? I am usu- !
ally at the gymnasium from 11 to 1.
Yours very truly,
MARVIN O. ADAMS"
1 don't know what the last sentence refers to, but !
1 hear Marvin O. is quite a fencer. The only thing I j
know about fencing is what I saw in a Robin Hood pic- j
ture when 1 was G years old. 1 don't think I would he 1
lot j proficent at sallying back and forth through (be
gym showers and over the lockers. However, any
other weapon will do.

TKItKII IC, TEKKIMC, TEKKIITC. What? The |
Spring Show, of course. Some day they'll be mention- I
ing Wally White, who wrote the words and music for
all the songs, in the same hallowed tones reserved for
Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. Sue Alter was a gem.
Kock Campbell was dashing. Betty Benson was super.
And, of course, George Denny buttoned-up the whole
show —or unbuttoned it, if you wish.

I was talking with a pre-med student, and he tells j
me that today my heart beat 103.000 times, tlial my
blood traveled 1Gb.000,000 mile.s. That I breathed 215,040
times, that I inhaled 43b cubic feet of air; that I spoke !
4.800 words, that I moved 750 major muscles, ami that
1 excerised 7,000 000 brain cells.
I'm tired.

why aren't you in uniform doing your part instead of
making wisecracks and criticizing not only one of the
greatest generals and statesmen, but one of the great
est and most brilliant Americans of all time.

Next comes a letter from Marvin O. Adams, the
country's most prolific letter-to- the-editor writer. In
reference to my statement "1 was walking down the
Quad, trying to figure out wbat Marvin O. Adams'
name meant spelled backwards," 1 received this letter:
"Sir!"
(Notice how he stalled off the letter vsith an ev-

clamalion point, which is really a period that has |
exploded.)
"Just what do you mean in this morning's Bull Ses
sion? And what does your name mean spelled back- !
wards? Perhaps you would like to explain? I am usu- !
ally at the gymnasium from 11 to 1.
Yours very truly,
MARVIN O. ADAMS"
1 don't know what the last sentence refers to, but !
1 hear Marvin O. is quite a fencer. The only thing I j
know about fencing is what I saw in a Robin Hood pic- j
ture when 1 was G years old. 1 don't think I would he 1
lot j proficent at sallying back and forth through (be
gym showers and over the lockers. However, any
other weapon will do.

all the songs, in the same hallowed tones reserved for
Cole Porter and Irving Berlin. Sue Alter was a gem.
Kock Campbell was dashing. Betty Benson was super.
And, of course, George Denny buttoned-up the whole
show —or unbuttoned it, if you wish.

I was talking with a pre-med student, and he tells j
me that today my heart beat 103.000 times, tlial my
blood traveled 1Gb.000,000 mile.s. That I breathed 215,040
times, that I inhaled 43b cubic feet of air; that I spoke !
4.800 words, that I moved 750 major muscles, ami that
1 excerised 7,000 000 brain cells.

Some ol the correspondence is too good for private
consumption, 'therefore we pass along to you the two
choicest fan letters that have come our way. When we
knocked out a piece on the Mac Arthur TV show, the
lollowing communique came from Los Angeles:
"Your parents must be proud indeed of your very
stupid and immature article oil General Mac Arthur
in the Daily. They must feel that the money spent
on your education is well spent."'
"You are such an inspiring example of young
America, in fact you are so good, that I suggest that
you go 1 ight over to No. 10 Downing Street to help
