# CAMPUS OPINION
## Says Critic Ought to Be Blue 
### 
To the Editor:
We wonder if you feel as sorry for Dick l'Yedell, the
author of Friday's "critique" on the Spring Show, as
we do. It he has s.uch y luw opinion of what .many
people consider to be one of the finest musical produc
tions to be presented here, he is going to have a frus
trating time attending subsequent Stanford produc
tions. (If he attends them for enjoyment!)
What was the matter with "Poor Richard" Fredell?
Did he have a poor seat? Did he sit on some gum?
Or was he too busy counting the parking lots around
campus? He did have an interesting article on the
paiking problem in Friday's Daily.
Fortunately, this year's Spring Show provided such
a wonderful evening of entertainment that it quite
overshadowed Poor Richard's attempt to establish

himself as a dramatic critic. (Hack to the parking lot
Richard!)
