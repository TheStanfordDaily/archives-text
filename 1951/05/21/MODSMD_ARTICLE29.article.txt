# GOING TO EUROPE? HERE's-
## An American In Geneva 
### ROY HEMMING 
(Fdilor's Note: Writer Hemming spent last year
at the University of Geneva studying European his
lory and international relations under the <il llill.)

A new invasion of Europe has been yoing on since
the end of World War ll—an invasion by thousands
(it American, students attending European universi
ties under various exchange programs and the GI Bill.
Contrary to some opinion, not all the Americans
j5O to Paris. Several hundred are also studying in
the French-speaking universities at Geneva. Lau
sanne, and Neucliatel in Switzerland.
The University of Geneva is typical, I think, of the
many differences between Swiss and American college
life.
The most striking difference is physical. There are
no dorms or fraternity houses, no campus theater, no
or courtyards that are so familiar lo American
students.
Instead, the university consists of one three-story
building used only for class lectures and recitations,
much like a U.S. high school.
'I lie classroom schedule begins at 8 a.m. and runs
through 7 p.m.—when the university literally locks
lip for the night.
No one lives at the university. Most of the students
r« ide at "pensions, the Swiss equivalent of American
boarding house:-.. Few "pension:,' accommodate more
than two or three students.
Lodging and tluee meals a day cost about 300 Swiss
francs (or $75) a month.
1 he official language at the university is French,
but thefe are also courses given in English. Special
French language courses are offered foreigners, both
on the beginner and advanced level.
A few professors who teach in French but under
: tarid English let students use English for their exami
nations.
There are no required finals or midterms in the
American tradition, except for progress exams for
(«l students. After registering, a student is pretty
much on his own in preparing for whatever degree
he is seeking.
None of the university officials I met felt it their
responsibility to tell a student what course-, he should

or must take for certain degrees—and this was a
cause ol many gripes about the looseness of the Swiss
system by Americans used to "directed studies."
But the Geneva administrators looked on each stu
dent as an adult, intelligent enough to know or find
out for himself.
The .student-professor relationship is also different.
At Geneva, the professor is a sort of deity who is to In
seen and heard—period.
It is only "those brash Americans" who challenge
a professor in class or after class. Actually, this is
more taken for granted than encouraged. Many pro
fessors like Americans especially because they are
not alraid lo ask questions or challenge viewpoints.
There is no "school spirit" as Americans know it,
partly because extra-curricular activities do not as
sume the importance they do here.
Such a college life makes the business of getting to
know other students a much slower process. There is
little of the daily contact found in American dormi
tories or activities outside the classroom.
Yet. one activity at the University of Geneva al
most makes up for the lack of others. That activity
is skiing.
The university provides instructors for both the
novice and expert, arranges transportation to and from
. ki areas, and usually secures reduced student rate:,
lor . k ki-lilt.s, hotels, and meals.
Outside the ski season, the chief spoils are bioycliir
and lounging in sidewalk cafes.
Ihe sidewalk cafes are unique institutions. Per
sons call spend hour after hour in one sipping coffee,
vermouth, or beer, and watching the world go by
and arguing about it.
1 he location of Geneva in the very heart of Europe
makes it ideal as a starting point for trips to Italy,
Austria, Get many, France, or even farther away to
Spain, Holland, Belgium, and England.
The university helps arrange such trips at eonsid
«table reductions in price.
Some students may quibble over the merits and de
merits ol Swiss university life compared to our own,
I.ut the combination of classroom : Italy in tin- center
of Europe and the opportunity lo observe life through
out most ol the Continent offer: an unequalled experi-

A new invasion of Europe has been yoing on since
the end of World War ll—an invasion by thousands
(it American, students attending European universi
ties under various exchange programs and the GI Bill.
Contrary to some opinion, not all the Americans
j5O to Paris. Several hundred are also studying in
the French-speaking universities at Geneva. Lau
sanne, and Neucliatel in Switzerland.
The University of Geneva is typical, I think, of the
many differences between Swiss and American college
life.
The most striking difference is physical. There are
no dorms or fraternity houses, no campus theater, no
or courtyards that are so familiar lo American
students.
Instead, the university consists of one three-story
building used only for class lectures and recitations,
much like a U.S. high school.
'I lie classroom schedule begins at 8 a.m. and runs
through 7 p.m.—when the university literally locks
lip for the night.
No one lives at the university. Most of the students
r« ide at "pensions, the Swiss equivalent of American
boarding house:-.. Few "pension:,' accommodate more
than two or three students.
Lodging and tluee meals a day cost about 300 Swiss
francs (or $75) a month.
1 he official language at the university is French,
but thefe are also courses given in English. Special
French language courses are offered foreigners, both
on the beginner and advanced level.
A few professors who teach in French but under
: tarid English let students use English for their exami
nations.
There are no required finals or midterms in the
American tradition, except for progress exams for
(«l students. After registering, a student is pretty
much on his own in preparing for whatever degree
he is seeking.
None of the university officials I met felt it their
responsibility to tell a student what course-, he should

or must take for certain degrees—and this was a
cause ol many gripes about the looseness of the Swiss
system by Americans used to "directed studies."
But the Geneva administrators looked on each stu
dent as an adult, intelligent enough to know or find
out for himself.
The .student-professor relationship is also different.
At Geneva, the professor is a sort of deity who is to In
seen and heard—period.
It is only "those brash Americans" who challenge
a professor in class or after class. Actually, this is
more taken for granted than encouraged. Many pro
fessors like Americans especially because they are
not alraid lo ask questions or challenge viewpoints.
There is no "school spirit" as Americans know it,
partly because extra-curricular activities do not as
sume the importance they do here.
Such a college life makes the business of getting to
know other students a much slower process. There is
little of the daily contact found in American dormi
tories or activities outside the classroom.
Yet. one activity at the University of Geneva al
most makes up for the lack of others. That activity
is skiing.
The university provides instructors for both the
novice and expert, arranges transportation to and from
. ki areas, and usually secures reduced student rate:,
lor . k ki-lilt.s, hotels, and meals.
Outside the ski season, the chief spoils are bioycliir
and lounging in sidewalk cafes.
Ihe sidewalk cafes are unique institutions. Per
sons call spend hour after hour in one sipping coffee,
