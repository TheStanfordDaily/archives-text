# Utah Prisoners Riot
## 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY â€” More than
400 Utah prisoners tonight released
seven guards they had held as host
ages during a five-hour riot and
promised to return to their cells
after cleaning up thousands of dol
lars of damage they'd done to the
ultra - modern new state peniten
tiary.
A spokesman for the rioters said
that the disturbance was being
called ofT because the inmates were
satisfied "with the promise made by
the Board of Corrections that
charges" against four prison officials
"would be fully investigated."
No one was injured during the
long and extremely ton;-;e riot. More
than 200 peace officers, with riot
guns and tear gas, surrounded the
swanky new prison 20 miles south
of Salt Lake City and prevented any
cscapes.
