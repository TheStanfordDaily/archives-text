# Benefit Showing Set For Oresteia Trilogy
## 
### 
A special benefit performance
of the Oresteia will be held
Saturday afternoon, June 2, for
the Stanford Mother's Club. |
Tickets for this performance are
available at the Memorial Audi
torium box office for $1.50.
Regular performances of the three j
plays of the Aesehylian Trilogy will J
be given May 31, June 1, and June 2. |
Tickets are on .sale for $1.20 at the
Mem Aud box office.
Commissioned to do an original
score lor the play are Leonard Ratner
and George Houle of the Music Dc- I
partment. Rut nor has composed the j
score for Agamemnon and for certain 1
choral odes in the other two plays.
Houle is assisting him and has com- |
posed music for the Choephoroe and j
the Eumenides.
In the choral odes of the Oresteia, j
the various choruses retell past |
events which have bearing on the j
.story. The odes also express the
chorus* emotional reaction of the j
drama.
In the time of the ancient Greeks j
these odes were accompanied by mu

sic, but the original music has been
lost. In the Stanford version the
choruses will be recited, sung, chant-
I ed, and danced with a musical
[ background.
Ratner has a-.so composed a dance
for the Furies, strange goddesses
charged with the responsibility of
punishing those who murder their
j own blood relatives.
The orchestration for the trilogy
| will be for a small orchestra made up
j of woodwinds, percussion, harps, and
a few brasses. The original Greek
orchestra was probably smaller,
mainly limited to "a flute player."
Professor Sandor Salgo is general
j supervisor of the orchestra.
