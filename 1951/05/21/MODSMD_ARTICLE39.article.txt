## Sports The Stanford Daily 
### GEORGE ANDERSON 
Stanford wound up its 1951
baseball campaign by taking
California 5 to 3 in the Sunken
Diamond Saturday. The win
gave the Cards the Big Series
for the third consecutive year as
they chalked up their eighth vic
tory in their last ten starts
against the men of Clint Evans.
The Bears' classy right - hander
Dill Nishita was nicked for his third
defeat at the hands of the Indian
nine, as lie contributed three un
earned runs with three errors, the
only bobbles of the game. Stanford
tallied first in the opening frame as
Jack Shepard tripled into the hole !
between right and center field with
two down.
Jirn Agar followed by bouncing !
an easy grounder toward the? pitch-]

er's mound. Nishita, who is rated as
the top fielding pitcher to hit the
circuit in several years, was too
sure of Agar's bouncer, and the ball
trickled off his glove, allowing
Shepard to score.
The Indians picked up a pair of
earned runs in the third after
Shepard walked and scored when
Atfar parked a triple up on the
right (ield hank. Tom Shaw de
livered a "broken bat" single
over shortstop to send Agar
scampering home.
Cal broke into the scoring col
umn in the fifth stanri as Hugh
lluddleston dropped a double along
the left field foul line, and Don
Dodson drove him home by lashing
a .single into right.
The Bears cut Stanford's margin
to 3 to 2 in the top of the seventh
as Roger Osenbaugh walked Cas
Mini')/, with the bases loaded. How
ever, Nishita gave the Cards their
winning bulge in the bottom of the
seventh with two more miscues.
Shepard led off the frame by
drawing a base on balls. Agar
bunted toward third and Nishita
raced over to pick up the ball. How
ever, he hobbled it long enough to
allow Agar to reach first.
Nishita then flipped the ball
underhand in the general direc
tion of first and it ended up on
the bank along the right field foul
line. Shepard never stopped run
ning until he crossed the plate,
and Agar raced clear to third on
the play.
Dick Corzine sent a high fly to
Al Davies in deep center field. Agar
tagged up after the catch and took
off for home.
Davies threw a perfect strike into
llpme plate that drew a round of
applause from the partisan Stanford
crowd. However, Agar was able to
slide across the dish just ahead of
the ball for Stanford's fifth and
final run.
California looked for a while as
if they might get back in the ball
game in the ninth as pinch-hitter
Pete Corona dropped a pop fly on
the infield grass for a single. After
two were out, Dodson singled into
right and Munoz walked to load the
bags. Syl McNinch singled to right,
scoring Tom Keough, running for
Corona.
However, Osenhaugh was not
to be denied as Davies swung fu
tilely at three pitches to end the
game. The win gave the Cards an
ei,'{ht won and eight lost record in
CIBA play this year with a 20 and
I'! over-all mark.
USC's powerful Trojans won the
pennant by splitting a double
header with UCLA in Los Angeles.
The split gave the Trojans the right
to meet the Northern Division
ehamp for the PCC crown and a
possible shot at the NCAA tourna
ment.
