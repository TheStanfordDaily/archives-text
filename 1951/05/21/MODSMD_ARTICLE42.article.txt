# Frosh Track Season Ends
## 
### 
A small squad of Papoose cinder
men closed out the frosh season
| Saturday with some good perl'orm
| ances in the Modesto Relays.
The California frosh two-mile re
lay squad were easy victors in then
challenge race with the Card year
lings. The Indians broke the meet
J standard by about nine seconds but
were still far back of the Bearcubs
! who clipped 17.5 seconds off the
previous mark.
The Indians also took second to
the Berkeleyites in the mile relay
I where the Bearcubs set a second
record. Cal's time was 3:21.7 as
compared to 3:23.1 for the Card
babes.
Jim Mclndoe grabbed a second in
the javelin at 173 ft. 8 in.—his best
mark — and tied for third in the
pole vault at 12 ft. 6 in.
Casualty of the night was half
miler Warren Sanborn, who was hit
on the back of the head with a
stray discus. Luckily, the 4 Va
i pound platter, thrown from a short
! distance, hit on its face rather than
on its edge. Sanborn wasn't hurt
seriously and came back later to
run a 1:59 first leg of the two-mile
| relay.
