100-yard freestyle. His tunes were
2:11.4 and 52.8.
The outstanding performance of j

who swam on the 1948 Olympic |
team, burned up the league as a |
sophomore, but faded last year.

59.5 in the 100. Both these marks

are the best ever done on the West
Coast.

but still managed to grab a first and
two seconds. In the 200 breast
stroke, the tiring junior was barely
beaten by defending champ Monte
Nitzkowski of UCLA, alter a thrill
ing stroke-for-stroke last lap. Fro
jen came back in the 100 the next
day to win in 1:02.2.

in his try for a PCC record in the
1,5'J0 - meter freestyle, when the

hour bfore he was slated to swim

Scrappy little Al Laudevback of
Cal trailed Pete by just a lew yards
for the first GO laps of the 25-yard
pool, then started his sprint. In the
remaining five laps, Lauderback
pulled past to win by five yards, in
the excellent time of 19:02.2.
