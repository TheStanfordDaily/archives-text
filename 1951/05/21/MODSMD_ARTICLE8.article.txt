# Dr. Rathbun Will Address Conference on Leadership
## 
### RAY CHAPMAN 
Stanford will make a grass roots approach to the problem of
national leadership tomorrow when the second Student Leader
ship Conference begins at 3:30 p.m. in Room 2 of the Education
Building.
Just what Stanford can contribute to national and world leader-

ship was explained by Dr. Harry J.
Rathbun, professor of law, in an in
terview Friday.
Dr. Rathbun, who will deliver the
keynote address on "The Philosophy
of Student Leadership," said we arc
waiting for a man to "step in and by
the sheer l ightness of his proposals,
sell them to America."
Leadership, he explained, has a
pyramid effect. If the foundation is
weak, the top is weak. The confer
ence tomorrow will try to build the
solid foundation necessary for effec
tive national leadership, he said.
What Dr. Rathbun intends to do
in his talk tomorrow is to explain
the challenge, opportunity, respon
sibility. and importance of leader
ship at Stanford.
Dr. Rathbun is well qualified to
speak on the subjet of leadership for
he spent several years as a mediator
for government, labnr, and industry
during World War 11.
Leadership on the Stanford level
provides a learning process through
doing. Dr. Rathbun said.
"No one," he added, "can hold
leadership long unless he is actually
serving and helping the community
reach its group objectives."
So long as he is serving, people will
follow, he said, but when a leader
stops serving, he loses his following.
Leadership is by consent, not by
force, Dr. Rathbun pointed out, and
it is closely interwoven into the fab
ric of the democratic process.
"Leadership only functions where
there is some freedom of choice. The
more freedom of choice, the more de
mocracy."
Dr. Kathluin gave a partial list of
qualifications for good leadership.
He said a good leader should have a
keen sense of sound objectives and
if he is convinced the ideas of the
group are not sound, he must sell
them sound ideas.
A good leader must also sense the
need of the times and should be a
keen analyst, statesman, organizer,
and admnistrator.
For a capsule definition of leader
ship, Dr. Rathbun said it is fitting
appropriate means to recognized ends
and getting followers to adopt those
ends.
Dr. Rathbun quoted a favorite ex
pression of Dr. David Starr Jordan,
Stanford's first president: "The world
stands aside to let the man pass who
knows whither he is going."
That's part of the purpose of to
morrow's conference—to show stu
dents "whither they arc going."
Dr. Rathbun received his A.B. here
in 1916 and an advanced degree in
engineering in 1920.
After serving seven years as a
practicing engineer, he returned to
Stanford to win a doctorate in law.
He has been recognized as an ex
pert in the field of business law siner
he began teaching here in 1929.
