## Huskies vs. Cal In See-Saw Fight to Finish 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash.. May 21 (UP)â€” ;
The newest cra/.c among college j
students, teeter - tottering, turned
into an argument over just who ]
held the world's record tonight.
Two University of Washington
lads scoffed at the record claimed by
Gary Kaveney, 19 - year - old Uni- |
versity of California sophomore, j
Bob Brachtenbach, 22, and Dick
Priest, 20, both of Yakima, Wash., !
claimed Kaveney changed partners j
midway in his 54-hour stint on a |
see-saw.
' That eliminates him," they said, j
Brachtenbach and Priest pumped j
a sec-saw for 52 hours and five min- j
utcs a week ago. They promptly j
claimed the world record, which |
first was claimed several weeks ago j
by two Washington State College |
students and later "broken" by two
Seattle University students.
'Die Pi Kappa Phi fraternity
brothers of Brachtenbach and Priest
indicated they would send a tele
gram to Kaveney's Delta Upsilon
fraternity claiming the University j
of Washington pair still held the 1
title.
