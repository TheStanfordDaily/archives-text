### 
Two University of California fra
ternities, Delta Kappa Epsilon and
Bcti Theta Pi, were fined and had
(heir privileges suspended by the
Dean's Committee on Student Con
trol and the Inter fraternity Judi
cial Committee Friday.
The action grew out of a party at
the I)e|<e house May i at which in
toxicating beverages were served,
re ultimo in "considerable disorder,"
| jiecorcing to the Daily Californian.
A neighboring fraternity. Pi Kap-
I a Alpha, had complained to the
Berkeley police at .'5:07 a.m. May 5
that the Dckes were throwing bot
#tlcs at their house. Police found the
first floor of the Deke house lit â€”
tried with broken glass and dis
! covered two broken windows in the
Pi KA house.
A Deke told police that he and his
brothers had been having a party
an r l had thrown beer bottles at
other bottles lined up on the man
tlepiece. He said a few of the
bottles "missed their target."
The IFC committee lined the
| Dekes $500 and the Betas $130. The
| latter were co-sponsors of the party,
according to the San Francisco
News. The Dekes were placed on
social probation until December 1952
and the Betas until next February.
The Dean's Committee also de
manded the immediate resignation
of all the officers of both houses.
