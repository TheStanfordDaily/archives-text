# Grads Meet, Favor Printing Handbook
## 
### 
One hundred of Stanford's 2,700
graduates put their heads together
last Thursday night, hashed over
the results of a graduate survey
taken earlier in the week, and de
cided to start the ball rolling on a
campaign to "encourage a greater
exchange of ideas on cultural and
intellectual levels throughout the
graduate department."
Most tangible result of the
meeting, presided over by Grad
uate Excom Representative Harry
Rowe, was the decision to publish
a SfiOft "Graduate Bible."
Rowe will ask for funds to pub
lish the booklet from Excom tomor
row night. It will be sent this sum
mer to all prospective grad-school
ers.
Rowe (Biz School), Jack Marcum
(political science), Bob Johnston
(history), and Phil Laylandcr
(mineral sciences) will put. the
"Bible" together and also attempt
to set up a "graduate student or
ganization."
Future aim of the "organization"
will be to formulate an all-graduate
program of social, cultural, and in -
tcllectual activities.
"We want each school to know
what the other is doing, and wc
want to tighten student - faculty
bands on the grad level," Laylandcr
told The Daily yesterday.
"Most of all," the mineral sci
ences graduate emphasized, "wc
want to provide the graduate stu
. dent body with an outlet for the
things it is interested in doing."
Laylandcr pointed out that the
average age of newly matriculated
graduates is 29. He said the grads
are "a separate group with sepa
rate interests."
Poll results revealed last
Thursday showed that 182 out of
(JOO grads had answered question
naires sent out by the ASSU sur
vey committee. Qf the 182, 108
sairl they would be in favor of a
graduate student organization
(Excom), as opposed to 47 who
said "no."
Most graduates thought enough
emphasis was being placed on social
activities within their own schools,
but indicated a desire for more op
portunities to "talk shop" both
within and without their schools.
