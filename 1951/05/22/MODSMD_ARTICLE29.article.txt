# ACTION—And Mr. Hoover's Tower
## 
### 
One student-inspired crusade that has been
hanging fire lor some time now seems to be
rounding into shape—at last.
It concerns the opening of Hoover Tower on
Sunday afternoons. For longer than we care to
remember, the Daily has received letters on the
subject. We have printed pictures of groups of
tower-hungry visitors waiting hopefully on its
steps, and we have asked the University why it
hasn't acted to open the doors.
Alter much administrational sidestepping
and ied tape, Excom got hot on the issue.
Men's Halls Representative Phil Saeta, who
so successfully championed the opening ol
the Stanford Museum last week (some 2,400
persons turned out in the first two days), took
over the project. #
Yesterday, we met with Saeta and Mrs. Inez
Richardson, assistant an research associate at
the Hoover Library. Mrs. Richardson has of
fered to recommend to the University that the
tower be opened—on condition that five respon
sible guards be found to show the visitors
around and prevent them from "visiting" those
parts of the library not open to the public.
Should the tower be opened 10 Sundays a
quarter for three quarters, the cost —exclusive

of lighting, janitorial, and miscellaneous bill
ings—should run no higher than $500 per year.
This assumes that students will be paid to op- .
erate the tower four hours per Sunday.
Mrs. Richardson had estimated the cost at
$1,000 per year.
We feel the $1,000 figure may be quite a bit
out of line. Moreover, Saeta has hopes of re- ;
ceiving some help from Alpha Phi Omega, na
tional service fraternity on campus, which
might undertake to guard the tower and guide
its visitors as a service project to the University
without charge.
In any case—be the help paid or unpaid—
we see no reason for having to wade through
any more red tape. The situation has been
investigated and officials at the tower are be
hind the move.
Later in the quarter, Saeta plans to draft a re- !
port outlining just how the students plan to
operate the tower, what it will cost, and from
what sources the three guards, one guide, and
one elevator operator will be recruited.
We trust the University will give adequate
and thoughtful consideration to the Saeta re
port and that action will be forthcoming.

investigated and officials at the tower are be
hind the move.
Later in the quarter, Saeta plans to draft a re- !
port outlining just how the students plan to
operate the tower, what it will cost, and from
what sources the three guards, one guide, and
one elevator operator will be recruited.
We trust the University will give adequate
and thoughtful consideration to the Saeta re
port and that action will be forthcoming.
One student-inspired crusade that has been
hanging fire lor some time now seems to be
rounding into shape—at last.
It concerns the opening of Hoover Tower on
Sunday afternoons. For longer than we care to
remember, the Daily has received letters on the
subject. We have printed pictures of groups of
tower-hungry visitors waiting hopefully on its
steps, and we have asked the University why it
hasn't acted to open the doors.
Alter much administrational sidestepping
and ied tape, Excom got hot on the issue.
Men's Halls Representative Phil Saeta, who
so successfully championed the opening ol
the Stanford Museum last week (some 2,400
persons turned out in the first two days), took
over the project. #
Yesterday, we met with Saeta and Mrs. Inez
Richardson, assistant an research associate at
the Hoover Library. Mrs. Richardson has of
fered to recommend to the University that the
tower be opened—on condition that five respon
sible guards be found to show the visitors
around and prevent them from "visiting" those
parts of the library not open to the public.
Should the tower be opened 10 Sundays a
quarter for three quarters, the cost —exclusive

of lighting, janitorial, and miscellaneous bill
ings—should run no higher than $500 per year.
This assumes that students will be paid to op- .
erate the tower four hours per Sunday.
Mrs. Richardson had estimated the cost at
$1,000 per year.
We feel the $1,000 figure may be quite a bit
out of line. Moreover, Saeta has hopes of re- ;
ceiving some help from Alpha Phi Omega, na
tional service fraternity on campus, which
might undertake to guard the tower and guide
its visitors as a service project to the University
without charge.
In any case—be the help paid or unpaid—
we see no reason for having to wade through
any more red tape. The situation has been
investigated and officials at the tower are be
hind the move.
Later in the quarter, Saeta plans to draft a re- !
port outlining just how the students plan to
operate the tower, what it will cost, and from
what sources the three guards, one guide, and
one elevator operator will be recruited.
We trust the University will give adequate
and thoughtful consideration to the Saeta re
port and that action will be forthcoming.
