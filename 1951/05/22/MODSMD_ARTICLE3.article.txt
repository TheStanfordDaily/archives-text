# Pressure on Iran
## 
### 
LONDON, May 21â€”Britain may
impose drastic economic pressure
on Iran as its first step toward
blocking the seizure of its rich oil
interests by nationalization, well
informed sources said today.
British pressure soon might cause
gravest anxiety to the Iranian gov
ernment. Up to 30 per cent of Iran's
budget revenue is gained from
British payments of royalty and
taxes.
