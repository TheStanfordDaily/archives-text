## Writer Questions Lobbying Trips

To the Editor:
I read in a paper, not the Stanford Daily, that an
other lobbying expedition to Sacramento is scheduled
for May 22 by the newly-organized "California Stu
dents' Federation for Academic Freedom," which "in
cluded students from Stanford."
It may be recalled that on May 1, the Daily gave
about as much space to the previous expedition as to
the USC track meet. One wonders how many Stan
lord students went up, who were they, what were their
names? Were they subsidized, directly or indirectly
(e.g., offers of transportation, housing, meals) by any
group with an axe to grind?
Before the event a Daily article stressed the aca

demic freedom angle (which of course would make an
appeal to the university people). But when the stu
dents got to Sacramento were influences brought to
bear in support of a "phoney" Korean peace resolu
tion? This seems to have been given primacy in the
communistic "Peoples World" account of the lobby.
Perhaps the true aims of higher education would be
better served were all the facts known. Then we could
form our own opinion as to whether Moscow's usi' of
dupes and "innocents" extends to the Stanford campus
and whether the Daily has unwittingly given publicity
to furthering their ends.
