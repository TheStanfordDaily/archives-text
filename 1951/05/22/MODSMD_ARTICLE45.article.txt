How about the Mathias Myth? Did the Tulare Flash come
through?"
By now, even the most pessimistic Farm sports fan must be con
vinced that Bob Mathias, pride of Tulare and Stanford alike, is no
flash-in-the-pan, one-day-wonder performer. Many speculations

were tossed around in Cellar bull
.sessions questioning how valuable
tlie decathlon champ would be for
Coach J uck Weiershauser's thin
dads.
Sure, everybody knew that the
fc lJ y had lorn apart all sorts of
trosh records and scored phenome
nal fcobs of points in Papoose dual
meets. But many doubted whether
Mathias could produce good enough
marks in any one event to be a po
tent factor in the tougher inter
collegiate circles.
Examine the past track season
and get an idea of how Bob went to
work and concentrated on three
•-vents. With advice from Coach
Jack Weiershauser, Bob decided to
build up his weight events and keep
up his speed and hurdling ability
by running the low hurdle event.
His marks indicate quite a bit of
success. Consistently over 50 feet in
the shot put, his best mark places
him eighth in the nation according
to the latest Track and Field News,
'top event lor Mathias has been in
the platter toss. He is undefeated
against all collegiate competition
and his mightiest toss, IG2 ft. lO'/v
in., places him way up in national
rankings.
While not so outstanding in the
hurdles, Big Bob managed to take
four important firsts in the 220 low
barriers and also pull down some
valuable seconds and a third. Best
time in this event is a good :23.ti,
as compared to SC's Jack Davis
who has registered a speedy :23.1.
As for actual point totals, Mathias
opened up his varsity career with
the Cal Relays. He topped the dis
cus event, came second to the
Cards' Lew Davis in the shot ,nad

was on the winning shuttle relay
coin bp.
His Poin<s
Then came the spring vacation
dual win over Fresno. Bob chalked
up a nitty 13 points, winning the
lows and discus and again playing
second fiddle to L. Davis in the
shot. By coincidence, the discus
just happened to be a new Ratcliffe
Stadium record.
Other 13-point totals, with wins
in discus and lows and seconds to
Davis in the shot, were garnered
against UCLA and Occidental, both
in the Southland. In the Big Meet,
Bob scored two firsts and 10 points.
Against the powerful Trojans, he
grabbed off one blue ribbon, a third,
and a tie for a third.
With 112 the regular season over,
predictions are coming fast on how
well the all-around star will fare in
such events as the PCC title races
and in the Nationals, scheduled for
Seattle. Mathias should grab the
discus title for the conference and
be very close in the Nationals if he
gets off one of his better tosses.
He should earn points for the
Cards in both shot and lows in the
Los Angeles Pacific Coast finals.
With peak performances and good
luck, Bob could grab off a point or
two in the NCAA shot. All this
should add up to a tremendous sea
son for only a sophomore.
Such rigorous competition will
not permit Bob to defend his na
tional decathlon title for the second
straight year. He'll pass up the 10-
event test until next summer when
Bob will be gunning for another
Olympic title.

How about the Mathias Myth? Did the Tulare Flash come
through?"
By now, even the most pessimistic Farm sports fan must be con
vinced that Bob Mathias, pride of Tulare and Stanford alike, is no
flash-in-the-pan, one-day-wonder performer. Many speculations

were tossed around in Cellar bull
.sessions questioning how valuable
tlie decathlon champ would be for
Coach J uck Weiershauser's thin
dads.
Sure, everybody knew that the
fc lJ y had lorn apart all sorts of
trosh records and scored phenome
nal fcobs of points in Papoose dual
meets. But many doubted whether
Mathias could produce good enough
marks in any one event to be a po
tent factor in the tougher inter
collegiate circles.
Examine the past track season
and get an idea of how Bob went to
work and concentrated on three
•-vents. With advice from Coach
Jack Weiershauser, Bob decided to
build up his weight events and keep
up his speed and hurdling ability
by running the low hurdle event.
His marks indicate quite a bit of
success. Consistently over 50 feet in
the shot put, his best mark places
him eighth in the nation according
to the latest Track and Field News,
'top event lor Mathias has been in
the platter toss. He is undefeated
against all collegiate competition
and his mightiest toss, IG2 ft. lO'/v
in., places him way up in national
rankings.
While not so outstanding in the
hurdles, Big Bob managed to take
four important firsts in the 220 low
barriers and also pull down some
valuable seconds and a third. Best
time in this event is a good :23.ti,
as compared to SC's Jack Davis
who has registered a speedy :23.1.
As for actual point totals, Mathias
opened up his varsity career with
the Cal Relays. He topped the dis
cus event, came second to the
Cards' Lew Davis in the shot ,nad

was on the winning shuttle relay
coin bp.
His Poin<s
Then came the spring vacation
dual win over Fresno. Bob chalked
up a nitty 13 points, winning the
lows and discus and again playing
second fiddle to L. Davis in the
shot. By coincidence, the discus
just happened to be a new Ratcliffe
Stadium record.
Other 13-point totals, with wins
in discus and lows and seconds to
Davis in the shot, were garnered
against UCLA and Occidental, both
in the Southland. In the Big Meet,
Bob scored two firsts and 10 points.
Against the powerful Trojans, he
grabbed off one blue ribbon, a third,
and a tie for a third.
With 112 the regular season over,
predictions are coming fast on how
well the all-around star will fare in
such events as the PCC title races
and in the Nationals, scheduled for
Seattle. Mathias should grab the
discus title for the conference and
be very close in the Nationals if he
gets off one of his better tosses.
He should earn points for the
Cards in both shot and lows in the
Los Angeles Pacific Coast finals.
With peak performances and good
luck, Bob could grab off a point or
two in the NCAA shot. All this
should add up to a tremendous sea
son for only a sophomore.
Such rigorous competition will
not permit Bob to defend his na
tional decathlon title for the second
straight year. He'll pass up the 10-
event test until next summer when
Bob will be gunning for another
