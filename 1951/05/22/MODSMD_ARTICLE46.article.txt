## Zinck Curls A No-hitter 
### 
Mike Zinck pitched the first no
hitter of the 1951 intramural solt
ball season as Theta Chi nosed out
SAE I 19-0 in a five-inning game
yesterday. Zinck helped his own
cause by blasting out a single and a
homer in three trips to the plate,
driving in three runs.
Mike, a junior from Stockton,
credits his fine performance to his
weight - lilting activities at Floyd
Page's Palo Alto gymnasium. He
entered the 1951 "Mr. San Fran
cisco" contest but failed to place.
Dekes Eke Win
Dick Senseney's two -on - board
homer in the last inning gave the
Dekes a 5 to 4 win over the Alpha
Sigs in an intramural tilt played
yesterday.
Alpha Sig pitcher Bill Woolsey
had allowed only two hits in three
innings, but in the fourth frame
Charley McCluny doubled to right
and the next two batters got on by
error. A long fly and Senseney's
homer cleared the bases.
