Rapid Robert has tossed out all
ideas of Annapolis. He wants to
spend his next two years on the
Farm, and according to him, "I'm
really looking forward to football
next year. I'd enjoy trying it at
least once in college."
Plans have Bob at either fullback
or end. Things are still pretty much
up in the air, as he has had no
chance for spring practice and has
not had any conferences with Head
Mentor Chuck Taylor. Chances are
that the versatile guy named Ma
thias will wear the football jersey
just as well as he has the track
gear.


OVER THE BARRIER—Big Bob takes the high hurdles in stride.
Mathias passed up his favorite hurdle event and ran the lows
instead because of a pinched nerve in his back. With rest and
good luck, this injury might not prevent Bob from becoming a
potent grid threat next year when he dons the football uniform.
