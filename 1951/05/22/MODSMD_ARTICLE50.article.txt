# THE 						DEAN STORY
## Retirement From Basketball Brings Back Colorful Past 
### PETE GROTHE 
Everett Dean and his wife sat in
their living room a few weeks ago,
listening to CBS newscaster Car
roll Hansen. Suddenly, Hansen's
voice lowered: "Basketball lost one
of its greatest coaches an:| finest
personalities today."
Dean turned to him wife and said,
''I wonder who died." He glued his
cars to the radio again and discov
ered that he, Everett Dean, was the
one who had been "lost."
He remarked, "I bet it's the first
time anyone ever listened to his
own obituary. I had to pinch my
self to make sure I was still living."
The day after the Card coach an
nounced his resignation as basket
ball coach, he was sitting in his of
fice joking with Bob Burnett and
Billy Allhouse. Dutch Fehring
walked in and remarked, "It's good
to hear the old laugh from way
down deep again."
Dean said, "Yes, it feels good to
have the load lightened. I never
had a free minute coaching two
overlapping sports."
Dean has established an amaz
ing record in his 110 years of
coaching the sport of bounce. He
is one of the few to be named to
the Basketball Coaches' Hall of
Fame. Fifty-five of Dean's former
players are in the coaching pro
fession. lie has authored the
heavy - selling book "Progressive
Basketball."

While coaching Carleton College
in Minnesota from 1921 to 1924, hi*
hoopsters won 49 games while los
ing three. He made All-American
center in his senior year at Indiana
University. Dean won three letters
in basketball and three in baseball
while with the Hoosiers. He re
ceived the Western conference
award for scholarship and athletic
prowess. He guided the Stanford
basketballers to the national title in
1942. These are but a few of the
things that separate Dean from the
run-of-the-mill coach.
The venerable, well - liked coach
can recall countless anecdotes.
When he took his team on an
Eastern jaunt several years ago, he
noticed a somewhat eccentric old
Woman who was dipping into her
handbag and giving Mars candy
bars to all the players. She re
marked to Dean that the boys were
so gentlemanly that she wanted to
do something for them.
She reached into her handbag
and counted off eight five-dollar
bills. "Will this be enough?" she
asked.
"Yes, yes," gasped the bug-eyed
Stanford mentor, wanting to say
no.
"It's getting near Christmas,"
said the little old lady, "and I
want von to treat the bovs to a
sight-seeing tour of New York."
Mr. Dean wiped his forehead,
kindly thanked the woman, and
bade her good-bye.
He later found out that it was
Mrs. Mars, one of the richest wom
en in the world. Her husband
owned the Mars Candy Bar Corpo
ration, and her horse, Galhadian,
had won the Kentucky Derby that
year.
Dean was witness to one of the
freakiest baskets ever recorded. It
was in 1929, and this basket gave
Dean's Indiana team a 38 to 30 win
; over Minnesota. He explains it this
! way:
"With 30 seconds to go in the
; over-time, the score tied at 3G-all,
Bob Correll, Indiana guard, took a
[ medium shot inside the foul ring.
; The ball on the rebound landed on
the top edge of the backboard and
| stopped near the right corner.
"All ten players were converg
ing for the rebound and watching
the ball witli hawk-like attention.
| The referee went to the bench to
| get another ball to knock the
I game ball off its loftv perch. One
second before he started to throw
at the hall, it rolled toward the
other end of the back board.
"The ball rolled slowly; the play
; ers were crowding for follow-up
| position; the crowd sensed the un
j usual situation; and everyone stood
;up watching the ball travel 30
' inches on the top ledge.
"They witnessed the game-win
ning basket as the ball reached the
middle of the backboard. It be-
J came top heavy, losing its balance
and toppling off, passing through
i the basket on its way down."

While coaching Carleton College
in Minnesota from 1921 to 1924, hi*
hoopsters won 49 games while los
ing three. He made All-American
center in his senior year at Indiana
University. Dean won three letters
in basketball and three in baseball
while with the Hoosiers. He re
ceived the Western conference
award for scholarship and athletic
prowess. He guided the Stanford
basketballers to the national title in
1942. These are but a few of the
things that separate Dean from the
run-of-the-mill coach.
The venerable, well - liked coach
can recall countless anecdotes.
When he took his team on an
Eastern jaunt several years ago, he
noticed a somewhat eccentric old
Woman who was dipping into her
handbag and giving Mars candy
bars to all the players. She re
marked to Dean that the boys were
so gentlemanly that she wanted to
do something for them.
She reached into her handbag
and counted off eight five-dollar
bills. "Will this be enough?" she
asked.
"Yes, yes," gasped the bug-eyed
Stanford mentor, wanting to say
no.
"It's getting near Christmas,"
said the little old lady, "and I
want von to treat the bovs to a
sight-seeing tour of New York."
Mr. Dean wiped his forehead,
kindly thanked the woman, and
bade her good-bye.
He later found out that it was
Mrs. Mars, one of the richest wom
en in the world. Her husband
owned the Mars Candy Bar Corpo
ration, and her horse, Galhadian,
had won the Kentucky Derby that
year.
Dean was witness to one of the
freakiest baskets ever recorded. It
was in 1929, and this basket gave
Dean's Indiana team a 38 to 30 win
; over Minnesota. He explains it this
! way:
"With 30 seconds to go in the
; over-time, the score tied at 3G-all,
Bob Correll, Indiana guard, took a
[ medium shot inside the foul ring.
; The ball on the rebound landed on
the top edge of the backboard and
| stopped near the right corner.
"All ten players were converg
ing for the rebound and watching
the ball witli hawk-like attention.
| The referee went to the bench to
| get another ball to knock the
I game ball off its loftv perch. One
second before he started to throw
at the hall, it rolled toward the
other end of the back board.
"The ball rolled slowly; the play
; ers were crowding for follow-up
| position; the crowd sensed the un
j usual situation; and everyone stood
;up watching the ball travel 30
' inches on the top ledge.
"They witnessed the game-win
ning basket as the ball reached the
middle of the backboard. It be-
J came top heavy, losing its balance
and toppling off, passing through
i the basket on its way down."
Everett Dean and his wife sat in
their living room a few weeks ago,
listening to CBS newscaster Car
roll Hansen. Suddenly, Hansen's
voice lowered: "Basketball lost one
of its greatest coaches an:| finest
personalities today."
Dean turned to him wife and said,
''I wonder who died." He glued his
cars to the radio again and discov
ered that he, Everett Dean, was the
one who had been "lost."
He remarked, "I bet it's the first
time anyone ever listened to his
own obituary. I had to pinch my
self to make sure I was still living."
The day after the Card coach an
nounced his resignation as basket
ball coach, he was sitting in his of
fice joking with Bob Burnett and
Billy Allhouse. Dutch Fehring
walked in and remarked, "It's good
to hear the old laugh from way
down deep again."
Dean said, "Yes, it feels good to
have the load lightened. I never
had a free minute coaching two
overlapping sports."
Dean has established an amaz
ing record in his 110 years of
coaching the sport of bounce. He
is one of the few to be named to
the Basketball Coaches' Hall of
Fame. Fifty-five of Dean's former
players are in the coaching pro

Dean was witness to one of the
freakiest baskets ever recorded. It
was in 1929, and this basket gave
Dean's Indiana team a 38 to 30 win
; over Minnesota. He explains it this
! way:
"With 30 seconds to go in the
; over-time, the score tied at 3G-all,
Bob Correll, Indiana guard, took a
[ medium shot inside the foul ring.
; The ball on the rebound landed on
the top edge of the backboard and
| stopped near the right corner.
"All ten players were converg
ing for the rebound and watching
the ball witli hawk-like attention.
| The referee went to the bench to
| get another ball to knock the
I game ball off its loftv perch. One
second before he started to throw
at the hall, it rolled toward the
other end of the back board.
"The ball rolled slowly; the play
; ers were crowding for follow-up
| position; the crowd sensed the un
j usual situation; and everyone stood
;up watching the ball travel 30
' inches on the top ledge.
"They witnessed the game-win
ning basket as the ball reached the
middle of the backboard. It be-
J came top heavy, losing its balance
and toppling off, passing through
i the basket on its way down."
