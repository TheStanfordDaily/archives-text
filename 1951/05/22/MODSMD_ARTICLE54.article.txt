ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ADDITION—These three rooms opened for first classes at the element
ary school on Lasuen and Santa Ynez yesterday. The construction, which began last fall, was ap
proved for occupancy by the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education at their last
meeting. Two rooms are intended for kindergarten and primary classes and the third for a faculty
room. They relieve crowded conditions, but whether this will mean increased enrollment next
fall depends on the Board's districting, according to J. R. Addicott, principal.
