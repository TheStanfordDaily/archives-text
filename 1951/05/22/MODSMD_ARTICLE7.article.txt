# TUESDAY SERIES
## Spanish Professor To Tell of Mexico 
### 
Dr. Juan B. Rael, known to those studying Spanish at Stanford as
I the editor of "La Parcela" and "La Batalla de los Arapiles," will
prove tonight that teaching is not his only field of accomplishment.
As a result of several educational tours conducted in Mexico, Dr.
Rael will give an illustrated lecture on "Mexico: Its People and Its

! Culture" at 7:.'50 in Memorial Hall
j auditorium, the next to last Tues
j day Evening Series program of the
j quarter.
"The lccturc is meant to be an in
; troduction to Mexican civilization,"
[ said the professor, a native of New
| Mexico. Dr. Rael has been leading

I one-month tours of Mexico for six
] summers, during which time he has
I gathered considerable pictorial ma-
I terial about the southern republic.
Tracc 'Los Pastores'
After the tour ends this summer,
Dr. Racl plans to expand another
I area of special interest. "I'm going
to try to trace the origin of 'Los
j Pastores,' one of the folk plays
found among Spanish people of the
Southwest," he explained.
The play Dr. Racl is trying to
track down is one used by the mis
sionaries to instruct natives during
the early days of settlement in New
Spain. It is a religious play dealing
with the Nativity.
"Some people," Dr. Rael went
on, "believe this play to be of New
Mexican origin, but there is evi
dence that its soure may be in
Mexico itself."
Ph.D. from Stanford
Dr. Rael, who received his Ph.D.
! from Stanford in 1937 and taught
' at St. Mary's, Cal, and Oregon be
fore joining the Stanford faculty in
1934, has published many articles
concerning Southwestern folklore.
"The New Mexican Alabado," a
book of New Mexican religious mu
sic, recently published by the Stan
ford University Press, is Dr. Rael's
latest serious scholarly work. He
| also published a short time ago an
annotated bibliography of Spanish
: folklore in the Southwest.
Not the least of Dr. Rael's
achievements was the Latin-Amer
! ican Workshop, held at Stanford in
the summer of 1945. He was chair
man of the program, which offered
courses in South American culture,
politics, and languages.
Professor Ronald Hilton, of the
j Romanic Languages Department,
• will introduce Dr. Rael. The talk is
; open to the public without charge.
