## Bradley Verifies Military Policy 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 11 (UP) —
Gen. Omar N. Bradley said today
that the United States still wants a
"free and united" Korea but is not
necessarily going to continue the
war until that goal is won.
He said that the strategy is to
kill so many Chinese Reds—north
or south of the .18th parallel—that
"they will be willing to negotiate a
peace." He said that if the strategy
is wrong—as Gen. Douglas Mac A
rthur has charged—"then all of our
military people, all of our top people
who are responsible for worldwide
strategy . . . are all wrong."
