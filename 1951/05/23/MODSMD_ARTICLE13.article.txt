# TUESDAY SERIES
## Rael Talk Illustrated In Color 
### 
Speaking to a Tuesday Eve
ning Series audience of over
1,000 persons in Memorial Hall
last night, Dr. Juan B. Rael gave
an informal talk on Mexico, il
lustrated with colored slides
ranging from scenes of "the cliff
divers of Cuernavaca" to the
Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico
City.

A large number of the pictures
dealt, with religious architecture, in
which Dr. Rael has a special interest.
The brilliantly colored domes and
elaborate altars, no two of which
were alike, represent different cul
tural influences, often synthesized in
a typically Mexican baroque style, he
explained.
Historically important scenes in
cluded the oldest church in tho
Western Hemisphere and the site ot
the murder of the Emperor Maximil
ian. Ruins dating from as early as
the fifth century B.C. were also
shown.
The rocky bay of Acapulco, giant
sized fruits and vegetables grown in
Cordoba, and the top of a church
steeple rising out of 30 feet of .solid
lava were only a few of the many
spectacular slides.
Dr. Rael concluded his talk with
"An Acapulco Sunset," after having
shown most of the important cultural
and natural sights of the country.
