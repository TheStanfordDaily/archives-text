# Union Phone Threatened
## 
### 
Another campus telephone is in
danger of removal.
Repeated cheating on the coin
telephones located in the hall out
side the Union barber shop has re
sulted in a warning from the Pa
cific Telephone and Telegraph
Company that they will take out
the phones unless the cheating stops
immediately.
In one of these Union booths, the
telephone receiver has been re
moved twice. The old coin-on-a
string routine has also been used
repeatedly.
If these violations do not stop,
the phone company will remove the
most-misused phone first, and then
the others as long as the violations
continue.
This is the first public telephone
on campus that has been seriously
threatened, although several resi
dences have been warned, and the
Delta Upsilon phone has actually
been removed.
Students are reminded that mis
use of coin telephones is considered
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard, and is subject to the reg
ular penalties for such violation.
