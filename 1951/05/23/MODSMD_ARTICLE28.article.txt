### PETE GROTHE 
ITEMS FROM THE WEDNESDAY GRAB-BAG
112 almost joined the army a few weeks ago. And the
worst part of it is that I wouldn't have known it.
For many days, bold Daily headlines had screamed,
"Go to your draft board and pick uo vour deferment

—
test appli<Vtion blanks." If is
seemed a wise thing to do, espe
cially if you want to stay around
Stanford like I do. And especially
il you dislike the army like I do.
I never was in the army, but I held
the rank of tenderfoot in the Boy
Scouts for two years (before I
quit), and this was enough to give
me a distaste for the regimented
life.
I went down to Local Board 57

in San Mateo and walked in the first open door I saw.
A sergeant, wearing a horrible, dog-l'ood-brown uni
form, was sitting at the desk.
"Excuse me, sir,"l started simply enough, "could
you tell me where I can pick up my application
blanks."
The man in the horrible, dog-food-brown uniform
beckoned a bony finger at me. "I have what you want
l ight here," he said out of the corner of his mouth.
He handed me several sheets of paper and a pen.
1 looked at the sheets. I pressed my pen close to
I he paper. I looked again. I screamed.
"Gadfrey!!" I shouted. "This isn't an application
i blank for a deferment test! These sheets are for join
ing the army!"
"Why, yes," smiled the man in the horrible, dog

food-brown uniform. "Whul you want is in the room
across the hall."
Just think, I might have inadvertently signed the
wrong things, and I automatically would have been in
the army. To quote a Negro spiritual, "I never could'a
said a mumblin' word."

FIAJB OF THE YEAK. Mr. Wilbur Bailey, the lino- '
type operator fur the Daily, is a learned man. He is
also a joker. You may have discovered this if you
scrutinized last Tuesday's "Under the Weather" col
umn. Instead of the usual "Women's Rest Home" title
was the inscription "Women's Rest Room." One
name followed.
We trust the young lady spent a comfortable night.

DIGGING UP THE UEAI) DEPT. We admit to a
journalistic error which we shall now correct. When
we did the write-up on the intra-squad football game
which Leiser and his cronies coached, we failed to
report any injuries.
There was one.
The victim was Nelson Cullenward, the Van John
son-Lsh sports scribe (turned coach) of the Call-Bulle
tin. It was Cullenward who designed the 55-yard pass
play that Bill MeColl threw. When McColl completed
his pass, Cullenward leaped high into the air—and
fell down in a heap. He had pulled a ligament in his
knee.

ADVICE FOR TODAY. Don't tell your instructor
that her hose are wrinkled. She may not be weal
ing any.
