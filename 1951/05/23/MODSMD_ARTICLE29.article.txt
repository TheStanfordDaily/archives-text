# ONE STUDENTS VIEWPOINT
## 'I Don't Hate Communists' 
### 
(Editor's Note: Today, in its editorial columns, the
Daily begins a series of philosoph/cal discussions by
(iil Joiuis. A senior from New York City, Jonas is a
journalism major anil off-campus representative on
Excom. The opinions expressed in this and succeed
ing articles are the author's and not necessarily those
of the Daily.)
I don't hate Communists. I don't, for that matter,
hate fascists either. Nor do I hate racists, bigots, mur
derers, and persons who might hate me. I gave up hate
and hating several years ago when I realized how self
defeating hatred really was.
This philosophy always seems very simple to me,
Lut I have great difficulty explaining it to other people.
I always try to draw analogies to allied human dy
namics like fear, suspicion, and mistrust. But my
argument inevitably boils down to one point: if I hate
(or fear or suspect) Bill or Jim, he will react the same
way toward me. I leave him no other course. It is a
merry-go-round effect. And the more I hate Bill, the
more he will return that hatred, for whatever "rea
son."
_ So I tend to give Hill or Jim the benefit of the
doubt until he proves himself unworthy of my trust.
This goes for Bill whether he is a Communist or a
fascist. It is not B/ll or Jim that I am opposed to, but,
if he proves to be a Communist or a fascist, it is his
ideas that I cannot go along with.
There are two important aspects to this problem of
human relationships. First, almost always Bill's hates
or fears, if he harbors some, are based on delusions.
What is reality for him has no basis in objective fact.
II I return* that hatred, his delusions merely grow in
number and intensity. By not returning his hatred I
will probably not eradicate it, but I will certainly not
j'ive him cause for increasing it.
Moreover, Bill usually is under the impression that
I (and most people); are plotting to undermine his wel
fare. II I hate Bill or display mistrust toward him, I
rive him what seems good basis for his delusions. So,
if 1 can at all help it, J try to co-operate with Bill and
: how him that, likP*ttfefet humans. I am merely mo

tivated by "selfish" concern for my welfare, but that 1
regard his welfare, and every other person's, as inter
woven with mine. Therefore, if I have to look out for
my welfare, I will have to be concerned with Bill's and
Jim's when theirs is jeopardized.
Second, I am an incurable relativist. Even when I
feel inwardly that I hold certain absolute values im
mutable, I am likely to be motbfied by listening to a
good argument from Bill. Also, I have had the sus
picion that what I may believe to be perfectly valid
for myself, in light of my personal development, may
not be valid for someone else.
Moreover, there may be some truth or fact or social
pressure that I have not run across which has had a
.shaping effect on Bill. Because I cannot abide by any
dogma or doctrine, I have no scriptures or party line
to run to when in doubt. I am forced to think it
through, and invariably there is much to be said on
both sides.
Then, the choice for me has to lie in the least wrong.
I define, for personal reasons, the least wrong as that
which does the most people most good in the long run.
But I cannot be bound by geographical boundaries
and time limits when I consider "the most people." I
am forced to consider my membership in the tribe of
man first, and I believe that tribe extends for me into
the future as well as in the present.
In this way I try to deal with my fellow men.
Often it occurs to me, however, that some of these
attitudes would be desirable in dealings between na
tions. I cannot believe that nations are the final and
absolute extension of the organization of men. And
1 wonder how often in h/story and in our times, the
hatreds of groups of people (formed into national
hatreds) is so very similar to the hatreds of individ
uals: based on delusions of fear, mistrust, and
"Aryan" superiority.
I can't help wondering how many of our problems
would be solved if we took the attitude that every per
son, or every nation, was interested sincerely in his
own welfare or his own security, and that these inter
ests were as legitimate and human as ours.

ideas that I cannot go along with.
There are two important aspects to this problem of
human relationships. First, almost always Bill's hates
or fears, if he harbors some, are based on delusions.
What is reality for him has no basis in objective fact.

number and intensity. By not returning his hatred I
will probably not eradicate it, but I will certainly not

rive him what seems good basis for his delusions. So,

Jim's when theirs is jeopardized.
Second, I am an incurable relativist. Even when I
feel inwardly that I hold certain absolute values im
mutable, I am likely to be motbfied by listening to a
good argument from Bill. Also, I have had the sus
picion that what I may believe to be perfectly valid
for myself, in light of my personal development, may
not be valid for someone else.
Moreover, there may be some truth or fact or social
pressure that I have not run across which has had a
.shaping effect on Bill. Because I cannot abide by any
dogma or doctrine, I have no scriptures or party line
to run to when in doubt. I am forced to think it
through, and invariably there is much to be said on
both sides.
Then, the choice for me has to lie in the least wrong.
I define, for personal reasons, the least wrong as that
which does the most people most good in the long run.
But I cannot be bound by geographical boundaries
and time limits when I consider "the most people." I
am forced to consider my membership in the tribe of
man first, and I believe that tribe extends for me into
the future as well as in the present.
In this way I try to deal with my fellow men.
Often it occurs to me, however, that some of these
attitudes would be desirable in dealings between na
tions. I cannot believe that nations are the final and
absolute extension of the organization of men. And
1 wonder how often in h/story and in our times, the
hatreds of groups of people (formed into national
hatreds) is so very similar to the hatreds of individ
uals: based on delusions of fear, mistrust, and
"Aryan" superiority.
I can't help wondering how many of our problems
would be solved if we took the attitude that every per
son, or every nation, was interested sincerely in his
own welfare or his own security, and that these inter
ests were as legitimate and human as ours.

woven with mine. Therefore, if I have to look out for
my welfare, I will have to be concerned with Bill's and
Jim's when theirs is jeopardized.
Second, I am an incurable relativist. Even when I
feel inwardly that I hold certain absolute values im
mutable, I am likely to be motbfied by listening to a
good argument from Bill. Also, I have had the sus
picion that what I may believe to be perfectly valid
for myself, in light of my personal development, may
not be valid for someone else.
Moreover, there may be some truth or fact or social
pressure that I have not run across which has had a
.shaping effect on Bill. Because I cannot abide by any
dogma or doctrine, I have no scriptures or party line
to run to when in doubt. I am forced to think it
through, and invariably there is much to be said on
both sides.
Then, the choice for me has to lie in the least wrong.
I define, for personal reasons, the least wrong as that
which does the most people most good in the long run.
But I cannot be bound by geographical boundaries
and time limits when I consider "the most people." I
am forced to consider my membership in the tribe of
man first, and I believe that tribe extends for me into
the future as well as in the present.
In this way I try to deal with my fellow men.
Often it occurs to me, however, that some of these
attitudes would be desirable in dealings between na
tions. I cannot believe that nations are the final and
absolute extension of the organization of men. And
1 wonder how often in h/story and in our times, the
hatreds of groups of people (formed into national
hatreds) is so very similar to the hatreds of individ
uals: based on delusions of fear, mistrust, and
"Aryan" superiority.
I can't help wondering how many of our problems
would be solved if we took the attitude that every per
son, or every nation, was interested sincerely in his
own welfare or his own security, and that these inter
ests were as legitimate and human as ours.
