TOKYO, Wednesday, May 23 â€”
Chinese shock troops tore a Raping
hole in the Allied line in east Ko
rea yesterday, forcing new United
Nations withdrawals, and then
hurled several futile heavy attacks
against the American Second Divi
sion yesterday on the east central
front as they sought to exploit their
salient to the cast, which extends
25 miles below the 38th parallel.
