"A bad ending follows a bad beginning."
—Euripides (some time ago).
When the famous (ireek tragedian Eurip/des penned these lines it's
highly improbable that he had baseball in mind and especially the 1950
Stanford nine. Nevertheless, the words written so many age ago do ap
ply to this season when the Indians never recovered from dropping their
lirst two games to USC. To put it bluntly—it just wasn't in the Cards.
They got off on the wrong foot and never got straightened out.
You may remember that before the season we turned out a little master
piece called Herbold's Horsehide Handicap. In it we picked Stanford to
come in first—they came in third. Cal was named to the second spot and
ended up fourth. But worse is yet to come—USC, picked for third, won the
laurels, and UCLA finished second to fool everybody—themselves included.
Our comment on the Bruins went something like this: "would fill any posi
tion below last easily." How far off can sportswriter be? This year our
picking average was a nice, round, symmetrical .000. But at least we're
consistent and anyway we didn't pick the Seals to win the PCL.
