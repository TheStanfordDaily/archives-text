# Card Prospects for Next Year
## 
### 
A look at Stanford for '52? Well, such stalwarts as Shepard, Abrahamson,
Osenbaugh, Joe Chez, Jim Walsh, Jim Agar, Bruce Iversen, Dave Rosen
kraritz, Chuck Essegian, Bob Murphy, Tony Stellar, Dick Cole, and Rog
Irvine will return.
Add to this a few up-and-coming l'rosh stars, including shortstop Warren
Goodrich, who's as classy an infielder as this school has seen in many a year.
He's a good bet to fill that leadoff position next year. Also keep an eye on
sure-fielding Jack Gebert at second and Bill Moflfelt at first. Catcher Clark
Nelson should help with his big bat along with outfielder Kay Swarts.
But it's in the pitching department that the '54 boys should help out most.
Lei ties Phil Page, I)on DeLong, and Jack God da id will help fill that big gap
in the portside department (Stanford had no lefthanded pitchers this year),
and righthanders Pat Dougherty, John Mauldin, and Mike Acker are all top
prospects. DeLong probably has the best assortment of pitches, Acker the
most poise, Mauldin the most stuff, and Page the most confidence; but all
six of these chuckers act like they've been around, although there isn't a
good fast ball among 'em.

FAIR AND FOUL. With l'rosh players being eligible for varsity play, there
will be no yearling club next year, but Coach Ev Dean plans a large JV
schedule . . . here's hoping that Bob Larson and Bill Alhouse return next
year as assistant coaches. . . . They did great jobs this season. . . . Cham
pion USC loses only third baseman A 1 Karan unless shortstopper Bill Lillis
joins the pros. . . . Kay O'Connor is the only departing Bruin of note . . .
while Cal says good-bye to four regulars and four first-line reserves, plus
Syl McNinch, who recently inked a Red Sox contract. . . . Ex-ClBAers now
in the majors include John Beradino (USC), Lloyd Merriman (Stanford),
Sam Chapman (Cal), Jackie Jensen (Cal), Ed Stewart (UCLA), Bill Werle
(Cal), iVlarill Coombs (USC), Duane Pillette (Santa Clara), and Jackie
Robinson (UCLA) ... in addition. Dale Coogan and Tom Upton attended
USC this year, ... At UCLA Jackie Robinson hit by .097 as a senior. . . .
There's a Suhr and a Cam/Hi in the Santa Clara frosh lineup, but they're only
the sons of the former major league greats . . , lqok for Santa Clara to drop
out of the CIBA next year, with a strong possibility that the Mission school
Will quit college baseball completely. . . . Los Angeles' Dorsey High Dons
have won 42 straight games for the best state record and have produced
Stanford stars Bill Herron and Bruce Cameron . . . while at his old alma
mater this year Cameron asked the baseball coach if prep whiz Ed Palmquist
planned to enter college and Stanford in particular. "Heck no," replied the
coach, "he's asking a $50,000 bonus." Even USC couldn't pay that . . . and
speaking of the Trojans, they have won over half their games from pro clubs
in the last 10 years while putting 30 of their players into pro ball. . . . When
asked what he was doing while ripping a baseball apart, Stanford hurler
Larry Smith replied, "I'm looking for the rabbit in it" . . . with that we
leave you. See ya at the Sunken Diamond next year.
