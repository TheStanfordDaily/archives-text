# Theta Chi Dumps ATO, 5 to 2
## 
### 
A handicapped Theta Chi softball
squad came from behind to score a
tight 5-2 victory over ATO in yes
terday's intramural play.
Weakened by a shortage of two

players and the absence of fastball
pitcher Mike Zinck, the winners
spread out over the field in an
original seven-man shift and relied
on hurler Bob Ames to pick up
their second win in two days.
The low-scoring contest was de
cided in the third inning when The
ta Chi Bob Morris rapped a homer
off ATO pitcher Otis Sullivan, scor
ing two runs to provide the win
ning margin. â€¢
In the only other game played
yesterday, Encina 5W rolled over
Encina 2E, 12-6.
Slowballer Frank Milligan pitched
for the winners, and Jack Curtis
added a home run to the 5W heavy
hitting attack.
