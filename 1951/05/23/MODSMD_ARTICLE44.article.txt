# Mural Mermen Qualify Today
## 
### 
Every now and again The Daily
makes a small error, and yesterday
was one of those times.
Heats in intramural swimming
will be held today instead of yes
terday, as was reported on the
.sports page.
Events include the 50-, 100-, and
150-yard freestyle, 75-yard back
stroke, 75 - yard breaststroke, and
four-man 200-yard freestyle relay.
There will be no heats in the div
ing.
Every swimmer entered has been
listed in a specific heat. If he is not
present today when his heat is
scheduled, there will be no oppor
tunity for him to quadify for the
final meet in a later heat.
Finals in all events will be held
at 4:15 p.m. tomorrow, along with
tin.* diving competition.
