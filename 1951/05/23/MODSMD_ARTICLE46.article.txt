## Soccer Power Rises; Fall Prospects Good 
### JIM MADISON 
During the tight athletic budget situation since the war. minor
sports at Stanford have in general been marked by middling par
ticipation and success, and little recognition.
Notable exceptions to this rule, to my accounting, have included
only rugby, pushed as a conditioner for football; and crew, in

which the participating fellows
themselves have been almost com
pletely responsible for the promo
tion and enthusiasm.
A third sport is now beginning to
show promise of adding itself to the
small group of exceptions—soccer.
After two dismal seasons in which
the team failed to win a game, the
foundations have been laid this
year for much greater activity in
the future soccer picture.
Capable Coach Found
Last fall the soccer squad by
chance fell heir to a capable and
enthusiastic coach. Stationed on the
Farm as an ROTC instructor, Colo
nel Robert Graham, former soccer
All-American at Penn State, took
over the coaching position.
Over CO green but willing candi
dates answered his call for man
power. From this group, he built
spirit and enthusiasm and devel
oped an aggregation which finished
the season by giving Stanford its
first soccer victories in three years.
Because of Army orders, the
Cards will lose Col. Graham ntxt
fall, but the spirit he fostered is
carrying over. Team captain last
year Jeff Morshead prodded Ath
letic Director A 1 Masters into hir
ing Buss Latham, rugby great and
all - league halfback on last fall's
soccer team, as temporary coach for
the first spring practice in recent
soccer history.
First Spring Practice
Thirty-odd men have been prac
ticing three times a weqk under La
tham's tutelage to develop and pol
ish their soccer fundamentals.
Last Saturday the practice was
climaxed with a full-length prac
tice scrimmage with Santa Clara.
Though the game was even in the
first, second, and fourth quarters,
the Broncos, backed by the super
lative goalie play of Jerry Tinling,
scored two quick goals in the third
canto to edge the Cards 2 to 0.
Promising New Players
A number of new players add
greatly to the team's hopes for next
fall. One is Ghuiam Ghaus, a slight
little inside forward from Afghanis
tan, who runs like he would do a
100 in about 10 flat, and is ex
ceedingly tricky on his feet.
Another is IJeryck Liecte, a sec
ond-quarter freshman who played
with the Olympic Club last fall.
Liecte shines at halfback. Another
good halfback in spring practice
has been Pat Dougherty. Dougherty
is a great ball hawk, but still shows
his inexperience.
Next year's fullback line promises
to be nearly impregnable. In addi
tion to John Sentous, 190-pounder
who was all-league last fall, Bob
Morris, 200-plus-pound ex-football
er, has turned out for fullback. Be

| tween the two of them, opponents
! will be mighty discouraged.
All in all, Latham, aided recently
by Leo Weinstein on techniques
and tactics, has done a good job in
spring practice, and should be hired
as permanent coach for the fall.
If the present promise develops to
1 reality, the Indians, come fall, just
j may beat USF. national co-cham
j pion, and blossom into another of
what Stanford needs more of—an
j outstanding minor sport.

fall, but the spirit he fostered is
carrying over. Team captain last
year Jeff Morshead prodded Ath
letic Director A 1 Masters into hir
ing Buss Latham, rugby great and
all - league halfback on last fall's
soccer team, as temporary coach for
the first spring practice in recent
soccer history.
First Spring Practice
Thirty-odd men have been prac
ticing three times a weqk under La
tham's tutelage to develop and pol
ish their soccer fundamentals.
Last Saturday the practice was
climaxed with a full-length prac
tice scrimmage with Santa Clara.
Though the game was even in the
first, second, and fourth quarters,
the Broncos, backed by the super
lative goalie play of Jerry Tinling,
scored two quick goals in the third
canto to edge the Cards 2 to 0.
Promising New Players
A number of new players add
greatly to the team's hopes for next
fall. One is Ghuiam Ghaus, a slight
little inside forward from Afghanis
tan, who runs like he would do a
100 in about 10 flat, and is ex
ceedingly tricky on his feet.
Another is IJeryck Liecte, a sec
ond-quarter freshman who played
with the Olympic Club last fall.
Liecte shines at halfback. Another
good halfback in spring practice
has been Pat Dougherty. Dougherty
is a great ball hawk, but still shows
his inexperience.
Next year's fullback line promises
to be nearly impregnable. In addi
tion to John Sentous, 190-pounder
who was all-league last fall, Bob
Morris, 200-plus-pound ex-football
er, has turned out for fullback. Be

| tween the two of them, opponents
! will be mighty discouraged.
All in all, Latham, aided recently
by Leo Weinstein on techniques
and tactics, has done a good job in
spring practice, and should be hired
as permanent coach for the fall.
If the present promise develops to
1 reality, the Indians, come fall, just
j may beat USF. national co-cham
j pion, and blossom into another of
what Stanford needs more of—an
j outstanding minor sport.
During the tight athletic budget situation since the war. minor
sports at Stanford have in general been marked by middling par
ticipation and success, and little recognition.
Notable exceptions to this rule, to my accounting, have included
only rugby, pushed as a conditioner for football; and crew, in

which the participating fellows
themselves have been almost com
pletely responsible for the promo
tion and enthusiasm.
A third sport is now beginning to
show promise of adding itself to the
small group of exceptions—soccer.
After two dismal seasons in which
the team failed to win a game, the
foundations have been laid this
year for much greater activity in
the future soccer picture.
Capable Coach Found
Last fall the soccer squad by
chance fell heir to a capable and
enthusiastic coach. Stationed on the
Farm as an ROTC instructor, Colo
nel Robert Graham, former soccer
All-American at Penn State, took
over the coaching position.
Over CO green but willing candi
dates answered his call for man
power. From this group, he built
spirit and enthusiasm and devel
oped an aggregation which finished
the season by giving Stanford its
first soccer victories in three years.
Because of Army orders, the
Cards will lose Col. Graham ntxt
fall, but the spirit he fostered is
carrying over. Team captain last
