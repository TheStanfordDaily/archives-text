# Miami Triad to Challenge Wed School Sing Record

Betas, Phi Delts, and Sigma Chis have formed one large group
for Friday's Spring Sing in Frost Amphitheater to offer some com
petition to the Medical School, which walked off with three tro
phies last year.
"We'd like to bet 'em," said George Bingham, chairman of the

Miami Triad group, "especially be
cause they took the song we wanted
to do." Unfortunately for them, the
Med School registered their group
before the Triad did.
Last year the freshman mod stu
dents earned the sweepstakes with
"Old Man Noah" and "Dcm Animals."
The Med School Glee Club, singing
"Jabbcrwocky," took top men's hon
ors; with the nurses, they won the
mixed division with "Tcncfcrac Fac
tae Sunt."
