# Excom OK's Relief Drive Improvement
## 
### 
A far-reaching revision of the
relief drive system at Stanford
was approved yesterday by Ex
com.
Bill Bethke, chairman of the re
lief drive committee and Men's
Row representative to Excom, pre
senter! a carefully charted list of i
changes in ASSU by-laws and listed
other committee recommendations.
The keystone of the revised policy, I
according to Bethke, centers on an
amendment concerning regulations i
and procedure.
The amendment says that by the
seventh week of spring quarter ;
Excom shall approve the number
of drives for the following year,
the specific charities to he lwne- j
fifed in each drive, and the propor- ;
t innate share of each drive's reve
nue to be allotted to each charity.
The second basic solution offered
by the committee involved the for- !
mation of a drives committee to han
dle all future drives. Representatives
of this committee would be from Car
dinals, lIR, YWCA, Public Relations
Committee, off-campus students, and
campus students.
Under the present system, Cardi- i
rials appoints a member to head each j
drive and Cardinals members do
nearly all the work involved.
The third item adopted by Excom
was a set of recommendations to next
fall's drives committee.
Among the important suggestions '
adopted by Excom in this section
were the following: only one drive
per quarter; a special summer
quarter drive for the ASSU floating
fund (charity fund); fall quarter
drive to he split (>O-40 between
cancer fund and Palo Alto-Stan
ford Youth Fund; and winter quar
ter drive to be split .Â»0-.>o between
Polio drive and Foreign University
Relief.
The Con Home drive will be the
| .sole campaign of spring quarter.
Bethke pointed out Cardinals
would retain an important position
under the new set-up. For instance,
I a Cardinals member will head the
i Con Home drive,
I
Speaking of the "keystone"
amendment, the committee report
said it would avoid confusion and
needless delay in setting up drives
the following year and would allow
j necessary advance planning for the
fall drive.
Bethke's committee started looking
into the problem of bettering relief
drives after complaints about poor
' management indicated all was not
j right.
Bethke said his group took into
consideration such complaints as too
many drives, poor soliciting, not
enough advance planning, too many
| special events like Tag Days, and in-
I effective publicity.
Certain values were set by the
group for charting the changes in
I the existing set-up. Among these
values were listed encouragement
of a general feeling of wanting to
give, more enthusiasm and interest
among solicitors, and better timing
j of drives.
The 11 committee members include
Harvey Segall, public relations com
mittee; Phil Nielsen and Kay Wold,
Cardinals; Mary Lou Sheehan, relief
chairman, fall of 1050; Nancy White
and Jackie Harris, YWCA; Bill Fun
denberg and Phil Saeta. Excom; and
Pat Terry and June Wilkin, ITR; and
Bethke.
