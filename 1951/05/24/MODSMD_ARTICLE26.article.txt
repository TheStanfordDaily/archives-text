# What Student Government Can Do
## 
### 
One thing that's as perennial as the road-ruts
around campus is the jam-packed condition of
our University Libraries come finals time.
it's not that the Main Libe —or the Education
l.ibe isn't big enough. It's just that some of
us don't bother about libe-time until Dead
Week rolls around and finals are just over the
hill.
All of which means that we couldn't exactly
blame our library people if they told us not to
expect an extension of library hours during
Dead Week.
fortunately, however, the librarians a/e
very human, too. So human that they've de
cided to keep the doors of the Main Libe open
until 11 p.m. instead ot 10 during Dead Week
and the weekend preceding.
A few weeks ago, Senior Excom decided it
would be a good idea to push the Dead Week
extension of hours. Senior Gordy Campbell
was chosen to get ASSU okay on the deal—■
then take his proposition to Library Director
Haynard Swank.
Dr. Swank liked the idea. He passed it along
to other members of his staff—and they batted
it around. Evidently there was some objection

to the proposal: for instance, why can't students
study in their own living groups?
Still, a majority felt that the Library is some
what of a sanctuary for many of us —especially
for those who live in large dorms where noise
and distraction are hard to control.
Yesterday, the official announcement of
longer Library hours preceding finals came
through.
The decision was simple enough—many up
perclassmen have no doubt "waited for it" for
some time now.
The reason it didn't corne about until this
quarter is simply that no one had sense
enough to bring it before a student group that
represents students: a group that might be in
a position to deal with the Library on an offi
cial basis.
In short, the extension of hours is just an
other example of what student government can
do to benefit you and me.
All of which suggests a small question: May
be student government is "farcical" only be
cause—most times our own inaction insists on
making it so.
