# ONE STUDENT'S VIEWPOINT
## 'Is War An Exception?'

By GIL JONAS
You think over and through this problem of brother
hood—how fine it would be if people believed the way
you do on it—and you conclude: This is one hell of a
problem to get people to even give it some serious
thought.
Most people, they tell me, if they saw a baby, any
body's baby, drowning in a pool, would refiexively
jump in and save it. But I have heard stories of ex
ceptions to this when a group has sat by and watched
helpless people drown. And we know of many more
instances of human sacrifice or deliberate mass
slaughter of innocents.
But I have always maintained that if these in
stances occurred so frequently as to be rules, we would
never have them recorded in history or literature.
Nor would we have the comments of condemnation
which inevitably follow the slaughter of human lives,
112 like to extend this theory into the study of war
whenever someone argues that wars will always be,
because that is human nature. It may seem shabby
as a point of argument, but I always ask "if war is
not the exception but the rule, why does history
place so much emphasis and space on the recording
of human violence? Why does it not, instead, record
the unusual, or periods of peace?"
I do not deny that human sacrifice, Buchenwald or
Dachau, war (or, us it should be rightfully called, mass
murder), all represent violent contradictions to the
brotherhood concept. But I maintain that for every
instance of the inhumanity of man toward man, there
are hundreds of instances of brotherhood that are so
ordinary, so taken for granted, that they go unre
corded.
These acts go unrecorded only when they deal with
individuals and .small groups. But in the history of
nations and larger groups, paradoxically enough, they
;> so unusual that they play a prominent rule in re
corded events—and in the growth of a one-world com
munity. Such events as U.S. aid to Japan in the Tokyo
t aithquake; Marshall Plan aid tu Europe (before it
wa:. prostituted to deprive Europeans of their self

respect and their independence of action); the Inter
national Brigades which fought against Franco in
Spain.
These events ar® few but I feel they are growing
in number as we become more aware of our inter
relate dness with other men, of our underlying inter
dependence with our brothers' welfare. '1 lie prob
lem is getting people to transcend the artificial har
riers set tip by the fiction of absolute national sov
ereignty—to get them to identify their causes with
those of the tribe of man.
This idea of the"tribe of man" seems to fill most of
the gapt left unfilled by the brotherhood concept.
There are more similarities biologically between every
man than all the other biological and cultural differ
ences put together. But there are also more cultural
similarities between man and man than there are dif
ferences. It is surprising to a product of Western
thought, for instance, to find out how many of the
great ideas attributed to Western civilization paral
leled or were preceded by Eastern thinking.
But this is nut the deciding factor in achieving the
unity of man because the similarities are often un
dermined by delusions of the paranoia variety both
on the individual and national levels. These delu
sions take the form that one man or group i s per se
superior in all ways to another individual or group.
Or it assumes the shape of the cloak-and-dagger
variety developed by Edmund Taylor — that every
other man, or every other nation, is a potential enemy
(instead of a potential friend). The danger of the
cloak-and-dagger delusion is that eventually what
was once a potentiality or possibility becomes a real
ity to the deluded mind of the individual or nation.
Then this delusion spreads like a contagious disease
to include other individuals and nations until the ob
jective reality is completely obscured by the delusive
myth.
Moreover, it forces the object of the delusion to
return the attitude of fear or mistrust and the disunit
ing .situation is intensified. Finally, it prevents any
further unilyjng process and, since the individuals or
nations are dealing with delusive myths as objective
asumptions of fact, it produces inefficiency, waste,
suffering, and insecurity.

You think over and through this problem of brother
hood—how fine it would be if people believed the way
you do on it—and you conclude: This is one hell of a
problem to get people to even give it some serious
thought.
Most people, they tell me, if they saw a baby, any
body's baby, drowning in a pool, would refiexively
jump in and save it. But I have heard stories of ex
ceptions to this when a group has sat by and watched
helpless people drown. And we know of many more
instances of human sacrifice or deliberate mass
slaughter of innocents.
But I have always maintained that if these in
stances occurred so frequently as to be rules, we would
never have them recorded in history or literature.
Nor would we have the comments of condemnation
which inevitably follow the slaughter of human lives,
112 like to extend this theory into the study of war
whenever someone argues that wars will always be,
because that is human nature. It may seem shabby
as a point of argument, but I always ask "if war is
not the exception but the rule, why does history
place so much emphasis and space on the recording
of human violence? Why does it not, instead, record
the unusual, or periods of peace?"
I do not deny that human sacrifice, Buchenwald or
Dachau, war (or, us it should be rightfully called, mass
murder), all represent violent contradictions to the
brotherhood concept. But I maintain that for every
instance of the inhumanity of man toward man, there
are hundreds of instances of brotherhood that are so
ordinary, so taken for granted, that they go unre
corded.
These acts go unrecorded only when they deal with
individuals and .small groups. But in the history of
nations and larger groups, paradoxically enough, they

corded events—and in the growth of a one-world com
munity. Such events as U.S. aid to Japan in the Tokyo
t aithquake; Marshall Plan aid tu Europe (before it
wa:. prostituted to deprive Europeans of their self

respect and their independence of action); the Inter
national Brigades which fought against Franco in
Spain.
