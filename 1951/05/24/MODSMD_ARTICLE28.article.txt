# CAMPUS OPINION
## In Answer to Marvin O. Adams 
### 
To the Editor:
'I he lobbying expedition to Sacramento was attended
by many groups other than .students. People who went
vvi'i'e interested in one or more of the academic free
dom bills. Kumford's FEPC bill, repressive laLor legis
lation. and the McMillan peace resolution. Groups
who went therefore included people from students,
rivii liberties groups, labor unions, and peace groups.
All with an "axe to grind," as Mr. Adams puts it,
and many of them undoubtedly helped finance their
representatives. No financial aid was obtained by any
Stanford students from anywhere, however.
There has never been any secrecy about w hat bills
were under consideration, who went, or any other
aspect of the trip. Students were primarily inter
ested in academic freedom so that aspect was em
phasized in the Daily and undoubtedly in other cam
pus newspapers. Many of us, however, were indi
vidually interested in other hills, too.
Through the Sacramento trip, many of vis learned
the value of intercollegiate co-operation and the Cali
fornia Students' federation for Academic Freedom
v/as formed. It is an independent organization of stu
dents, we finance ourselves, and the purpose is to
"j'l ind axes" for academic freedom.
The "phoney" Korean peace resolution which Mr.
Adams mentions is a resolution sponsored by Repre
sentative Lester A. McMillan (I)) of la>s Angeles.
Many disagree with the proposal, but Mr. McMillan's
sincerity is hardly open to doubt. From discussion
in Sacramento on the resolution an intercollegiate
peace council is being formed to determine areas of
agreement on which students can work actively for
peace.
I suggest that Mr. Adams attend and participate and
>'Â» ! a first hand opinion rather than to wait and form
hi:, opinion according to whether the communistic
"People's World - ' approves of the conference or not.
