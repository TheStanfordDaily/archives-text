To tti: Editor:
Mi Adams' letter is unfortunate indeed, for its
va(/iieiie?s and implications said lift)*- in an intelligent
.ippraisal oi the matter under discussion, at a time
wh**n clarification is so necessary.
Tliejf- is no n» »*d to r»-ly on unsubstantiated thargts

and references. About three years ago, several bills
similar to the ones under consideration at Sacramento
were introduced in the Illinois Legislature, known a.s
the "Boyle Bills." Some students saw in these bills an
inherent danger to academic freedom, and a protest
expedition wu; organized by a number of groups at
the University of Chicago.
For several reasons, but mainly because of the
greater group discipline and resulting greater par
ticipation of left-wing groups, the lobbying expedi
tion was turned from a general liberal protest into a
Communist-dominated demonstration which had
rather little to do with academic freedom, to the ex
treme embarrassment of well-meaning anti-Com
munist liberals who participated but found them
selves in the minority.
The demonstration, which did not distinguish itself
through tact or good behavior certainly did more to
set back the cause of academic freedom than any one
of the proposed laws. The bills were not voted into
law, not because, but in spite of the demonstration.
Academic freedom within the boundaries imposed
by the need for national security and safety is worth
lobbying for, but any individual who believes it
threatened should by his own protests not become the
tool of a regime willing to use him for its own dia
bolical purposes. A glance at the "academic freedom"
in the USSK should convince anyone that any tribute
paid to it by the Communist Party is nothing but lip
service to further its own goals and aims.
Anyone feeling the need to participate in such pro
test movements and unwilling to be made a tool of
Moscow should above all convince himself of the
character of the sponsoring organisation to make
sure that the liberal anti-Communist members of
the group are strong enough to retain complete con
trol. and not have the group pass by default or trick
erj into the bunds of Communist organizers.
It is a favorite technique of Communist-front or
ganizations to recruit members under the guise of
popular slogans and then to utilize these same indi
viduals for entirety different purposes. Looking at tin
recent and contemplated lobbying trips in this light,
one is forced to view the California Students' Federa
tion for Academic Freedom with considerable suspi
cion
