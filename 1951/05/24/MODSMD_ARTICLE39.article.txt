# Burnett 'Pleased' To Coach at Alma Mater
## 
### DON GILLIN 
"In my opinion I am succeeding
America's Number One basketball
coach!" -
This was the comment made yes
terday about Stanford's retiring
I basketball mentor, Everett Dean, by
his young successor, former Frosh
! Coach Bob Burnett.
"I make that statement without
: qualification," continued the new
' Cardinal headman, "and base it on
I all connotations of what I think a
basketball coach should be."
Bob, who took over the head
coaching assignment last week af
ter the famed Dean decided that
one sport, baseball, was enough for
any man, speaks with authority. He
first became acquainted with Dean's
methods in 1938 when he lettered
on the noted coach's fij-st Stanford
basketball squad. Since 1948 he has
divided his time between directing
the frosh team and assisting his
former mentor in the management
of the varsity squad.
Started in Oakland
Burnett's athletic career first be
gan at Oakland High School, from
which he was graduated in 1934.
Prior to entering Stanford in 1937
he played two seasons of basket
ball for Marin Junior College. At
Stanford he served as a substitute
on a squad led by the famed Hank
Luisetti. The following year he was
a member of both the basketball
and baseball teams, winning his
letter in the former sport.
While working for his teaching
degree in 1940 he assisted Dean
with varsity basketball, being ap
pointed freshman and assistant var
sity coach in September 1941. Like
so many other young men of that
time he had his plans rudely inter
rupted by the attack on Pearl Har
bor. Following a brief stay as head
basketball coach at Utah State, he
entered the Navy in 1942 as an avi
ation cadet, becoming an ensign in
1943.
Bob's wartime record is an ex
ceptional one. While serving with
Halsey's Third Fleet as a torpedo
plane pilot on the light carrier

U.S.S. Monterey, he was awarded
the Navy Cross for the "probable
sinking" of a Japanese aircraft car
rier in the first battle of the Philip
| pine Sea. Later decorations includ
ed the Air Medal, awarded him for
j operations which took him from
i one end of the Pacific to the other.
Bob "Pleased"
Today Bob is "pleased" to have
i an opportunity to coach at his alma
mater. Nevertheless he is fully
conscious ol the great responsibility
incidental to carrying on in the
lootsteps ot such great coaches as
John Bunn and Everett Dean.
"With the exception of two eras,
that ol Hank Luisetti and that of
Everett Dean's 1940-1941 teams,
Stanford basketball has not been
outstanding," the new coach ex
plains. "This can be directly attrib
uted to the University's high aca
demic and financial requirements,
which have resulted in a perennial
scarcity of able players."
He admits however that the fu
ture seems to be encouraging. Next
year's team will be made up largely
of seniors and sophomores, with the
draft acting as an ever - present
threat to the maintenance of player
depth. In Kamstead and Tucker he
believes that he has two players of
exceptional ability. The most press
ing need is for a large, rather rug
ged individual to aid Kamstead in
his backboard play.
USC Favored Next Year
"Southern California will prob
ably be favorites for the 1951-1952
crown," he continues. "This is due
to the large number of lettermen
the Trojans will have returning to
their squad. UCLA, ably coached
by John Wooden, will be defending
its third consecutive Pacific Coast
Conference championship. They too
will be difficult to beat. As for Cal,
her fine frosh team of a year ago
should begin to round into shape
during the coming season."
Bob will emphasize an aggres
sively defensive type of game next
year. He anticipates utilizing a
strict man-to-man defense, while the
fast break will form the backbone
of the offense. This type of play will
necessitate a well-conditioned, deep
squad, however. At least ten re
turning players can be counted
upon to turn in regular, proficient
performances.

Bob "Pleased"
Today Bob is "pleased" to have
i an opportunity to coach at his alma
mater. Nevertheless he is fully
conscious ol the great responsibility
incidental to carrying on in the
lootsteps ot such great coaches as
John Bunn and Everett Dean.
"With the exception of two eras,
that ol Hank Luisetti and that of
Everett Dean's 1940-1941 teams,
Stanford basketball has not been
outstanding," the new coach ex
plains. "This can be directly attrib
uted to the University's high aca
demic and financial requirements,
which have resulted in a perennial
scarcity of able players."
He admits however that the fu
ture seems to be encouraging. Next
year's team will be made up largely
of seniors and sophomores, with the
draft acting as an ever - present
threat to the maintenance of player
depth. In Kamstead and Tucker he
believes that he has two players of
exceptional ability. The most press
ing need is for a large, rather rug
ged individual to aid Kamstead in
his backboard play.

"Southern California will prob
ably be favorites for the 1951-1952
crown," he continues. "This is due
to the large number of lettermen
the Trojans will have returning to
their squad. UCLA, ably coached
by John Wooden, will be defending
its third consecutive Pacific Coast
Conference championship. They too
will be difficult to beat. As for Cal,
her fine frosh team of a year ago
should begin to round into shape
during the coming season."
Bob will emphasize an aggres
sively defensive type of game next
year. He anticipates utilizing a
strict man-to-man defense, while the
fast break will form the backbone
of the offense. This type of play will
necessitate a well-conditioned, deep
squad, however. At least ten re
turning players can be counted
upon to turn in regular, proficient
performances.
"In my opinion I am succeeding

Bob will emphasize an aggres
sively defensive type of game next
year. He anticipates utilizing a
strict man-to-man defense, while the
fast break will form the backbone
of the offense. This type of play will
necessitate a well-conditioned, deep
squad, however. At least ten re
turning players can be counted
upon to turn in regular, proficient
performances.
