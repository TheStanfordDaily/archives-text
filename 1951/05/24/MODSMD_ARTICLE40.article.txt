# PRO AND CAHN

### LARRY 
AV hiit an amazing weekend. A Stanford crew finally heats a boatload
of Berkeley boys. And what's more in our way of thinking, we got a
confession from a California oarsman that we wouldn't believe possible,
unless we heard it with our own ears. Here's the way it happened.
We were unavoidably detained in the City and could not see the race
Saturday morning. So we did the next best thing and tuned into the KIBE
on-the-spot broadcast. That account was unusual in itself as it was done
from a plane flying over the waters of Palo Alto Yacht Harbor. Bill Meyer,
lormer Card crew man, did a tremendous jub assisting the professional an
nouncer by filling in with details and technicalities of the doings down
below.
At 1 0: 50 the Cal varsity boat raced home a winner; nothing unusual about
that. Simultaneously we turned off the radio, convinced of the inevitable
outcome of the junior varsity and frosh races.
Double Coincidence
Later in the day we ran into an old high school mate, one Howard
Morrow. '1 his was indeed a two-fold coincidence. Primarily because
vv< had not seen him since last summer, and secondly because he is a
member of Cai's first frosh boat.
So we asked him how the other races came out, expecting the usual, smug
ieply, "Oh, we won. But no, he soured up and disgustedly answered, "Your
irosii boat he:it us by a hull lenyth," but added quickly "Our JVs Won."
We thought he was kidding, .so we asked him, surprised and somewhat more
i nthused. "How come?"
Now. hold ti,",ht. Here it comes, straight from the lips of a true, dyed-in
i be-bluo-and-gold-wool Berkeleyite: "Stanford just had a better crew."
I here it was. No excuses. Just about the first time we can remember a Cal
man accounting for a loss without the huts, whys, and so forths. He had ac
tually admitted that Stanford hail something better.
I bin I.he shocked himself, because be . v aid. "One ol our boys missed the
race and we were carrying an inexperienced oarsman." However, he con
tinued to amaze by stating that. "Even with a full first string. Stanford
Would have won." And he meant it.
Cal ( in Form
Seems miracles never end, but they do. Bear frosh coach Huss Nugler,
returned to the familiar coach's style when he said, "Stanford rowed a
race and we rowed a stinking one." But for that matter Card Coach Jim
Beggs said the same thing of the Stanford varsity.
Regardless, we feel that the frosh proved one thing. Stanford Is
rapidly turning into a University of not only gentlemen but scullers.
