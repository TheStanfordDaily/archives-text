This weekend the draft situation
rears, its ugly head to rearrange
the schedule of the Card tennis
teams, both varsity and frosh.
Since the Selective Servibe apti
tude test will be given Saturday
morning, it is necessary to hold the
final freshman match with Cal on
Friday afternoon and the varsity
match on Saturday afternoon at 3.
The Indians will be hosts, at both
events, which will close the dual
meet season for the l'rosh and var
sity. , . ,
