Revival Series members will see
"The Stone Flower" today at 4:15
and 7:30 p.m. in Cubbcrley Audi
torium.
The film, which Time magazine
said "can be highly recommended
to children of the broadest possible
age brackets (say 4 to twice 40),"'
is based on Russian folk legends
about a stonecutter and his search
for artistic perfection.
A new color process is used in
the picture, and the musical score
is melodious. This film received first
prize in the color division at the
Cannes International Film Festival.
