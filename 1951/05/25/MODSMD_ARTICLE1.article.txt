# Sandor Salgo to Conduct Farm Symphony Sunday
## 
### MARGY COYKENDALL 
When Sandor Salgo v/aves a large white handkerchief while
lie's conducting the orchestra in preparation for the concert Sun
day, it isn't the flag of truce. It's just one of his typical gestures
when a particularly tough passage is mastered by the orchestra.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra's second concert of the year,

open to the public, will be given
Sunday in Memorial Auditorium at
8:1.1.
On the program are Symphony No.
1 in C Minor by Brahms, Overture to
"Benvenuto Cellini" by Berlioz,
"Mother Goose Suitr" by Havel, and
two arias from "Don Giovanni" by
Mozart. The two arias will be sung
by guest artists Nancy Kronburg. so
prano, and Lawrence Mason, tenor.
Mighty-five Members
Miss Kronburg, one of the finalists
in the Atwater Kent competition, will
sing "Noil mi dir" while Mason, who
played in "The Devil and Daniel
Webster" and"The Jumping Frog of
Calaveras County," will perform "II
mio tesoro."
There are approximately 83 mem
bers in the orchestra, depending on
what, music is being performed. The
orchestra is made up of students,
wives of students, faculty, faculty
wives, a few Palo Alto High School
stiioents, and some outsiders.
Amazingly enough, scientists out
number the music majors. There are
17 music majors in the croup and
approximately 30 scientists -pre-mod
students, electrical engineers, physi
cists, physics instructors, biologists.
Critics "Favorable"
The orchestra, which practices
twice a week, plans a public appear
ance once each quarter. Concerts are
usually given in the fall and spring,
while the orchestra plays for the op
era winter quarter.
San Francisco music critics, have
given favorable comments to the or
chestra. Marjory Fisher of the News
has said. ". . . it is better than any
theater orchestra in the country."
Alfred Frankenstein. San Francisco
Chronicle, has remarked, ". . . bril
liant orchestra, while Alexander
Field of the Examiner said, "Stanford
boasts an orchestra that can play
anything."
Professional Caliber
Hungarian-born Salgo, the con
ductor, formerly violist of the Roth
String Quartet and at present first
violinist of the Lener String Quartet,
says he would rather conduct a col
lege orchestra such as this rather
than a professional orchestra because
I bey are so intelligent and mti ieal."
He stresses the fact that programs
Given are not on the usual "college
level" but of professional caliber and
more unusual.
Several of the scores widen ,vill be
performed by the orchestra Sunday
are owned by the little-publicized
Memorial Library of Music. The li-
I rary contains many collectors' item
first editions, and manuscript

Orchestra through a rehearsal in preparation for the concert this
Sunday night. The orchestra's repertoire runs from the strictly
classical to more modern works. —Photo by Dick Schwarz
When Sandor Salgo v/aves a large white handkerchief while
lie's conducting the orchestra in preparation for the concert Sun
day, it isn't the flag of truce. It's just one of his typical gestures
when a particularly tough passage is mastered by the orchestra.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra's second concert of the year,

open to the public, will be given
Sunday in Memorial Auditorium at
8:1.1.
On the program are Symphony No.
1 in C Minor by Brahms, Overture to
"Benvenuto Cellini" by Berlioz,
"Mother Goose Suitr" by Havel, and
two arias from "Don Giovanni" by
Mozart. The two arias will be sung
by guest artists Nancy Kronburg. so
prano, and Lawrence Mason, tenor.
Mighty-five Members
Miss Kronburg, one of the finalists
in the Atwater Kent competition, will
sing "Noil mi dir" while Mason, who
played in "The Devil and Daniel
Webster" and"The Jumping Frog of
Calaveras County," will perform "II
mio tesoro."
There are approximately 83 mem
bers in the orchestra, depending on
what, music is being performed. The
orchestra is made up of students,
wives of students, faculty, faculty
wives, a few Palo Alto High School
stiioents, and some outsiders.
Amazingly enough, scientists out
number the music majors. There are
17 music majors in the croup and
approximately 30 scientists -pre-mod
students, electrical engineers, physi
cists, physics instructors, biologists.
Critics "Favorable"
The orchestra, which practices
twice a week, plans a public appear
ance once each quarter. Concerts are
usually given in the fall and spring,
while the orchestra plays for the op
era winter quarter.
San Francisco music critics, have
given favorable comments to the or
chestra. Marjory Fisher of the News
has said. ". . . it is better than any
theater orchestra in the country."
Alfred Frankenstein. San Francisco
