## 
### 
A two-man Amcrcan debate team
will tour Great Britain next spring
under the sponsorship of the Insti
tute of International Education and
the Speech Association of America.
Australian educational organiza
tions are also considering the possi
bilities of an American team in their
country, but a decision will not be
known until mid-June.
Any undergraduate or post-gradu
ate student debater, man or woman,
who will be enrolled in a college or
university in 1051-52, is eligible to
apply for a position on the team.
Outstanding men debaters may be
nominated despite their status in the
draft. The selection committee will
ascertain whether it will be possible
to have deferments continued for
those selected.
Travel to and from the major points
of embarkation and incidental pocket
expenses are the only costs to be
bo rnc by the candidates and their in
stitutions.
Applications must be in the hands
of the Sub-Committees of the Com
mittee, Speech Association of Amer
ica, by June Ifi. 1951. In spring 1952,
the chosen teams will depart for
Great Britain and possibly Aus
tralia.
