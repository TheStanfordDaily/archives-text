# Optimism, Dollars, and Cement
##

Today the Daily goes optimistic, publishing
a building issue. Talk about the New Union.
New dorms. A made-over Encina. Plans which
involve dollars and cement, plans which even
tually will result in a better University.
To students who have been hearing ot the
new Union lor years on end. and who have
not seen so much as a spoonlul ol dirt turned
over on the project, this talk may sound tool
ishly optimistic.
We think not. A returnee to Stanford liom
the class of '48, tor instance, would see today a
Stern Hall, a Crothers Hall, a new electronics
lab, and a renovated Inner Quad that were not
here in his day. He would see the framework of
the New Eating Club building, and the half
completed wings of the Crothers additions.
He would also see a tiny, overcrowded Union,
a pitifully inadequate basketball pavilion, and
a Village two miles from campus, where stu
dents must live because there is no room for
them here.
In short, he would see improvement and he
would see discouragement. And if he reads to
day's Daily, he would see plans. As Dean of
Humanities Ray Faulkner says, "Nothing is ac
cidental. A building isn't just dropped." A
quick glance at today's edition with its diagrams

and stories ot things to come shows that Stan
lord ollicials are not trusting to accident.
Other Dailies in other years have had opti
mistic issues about planning. The issue of May
27, 1949, for instance, told of plans for a new
eating club building. Today that building is
nearing completion. Another case of dollars
and cement catching up with plans.
A stoiy on page 4 today quotes Thomas Spra
gens, assistant to President Sterling, as ex
pressing hope that the first unit of the three-unit
Stanford Union will "be underway within a
year." That's our Union he's talking about!
Right now some $400,000 of a needed $500,000
has been raised to start the construction of this
first unit, which will house a modern dance
floor, bowling alleys and other recreational fa
cilities.
Other plans have been charted and now
a wait only the dollars so necessary to carry
them out. No time will be wasted when the
dollars pile high enough-/o allow actual con
struction to start.
As we said before, today's Daily is optimistic.
It's full of plans for the future. But, based on
past activity and careful planning by University
authorities, we repeat: it doesn't seem like lool
ish optimism. â€”G.M.
