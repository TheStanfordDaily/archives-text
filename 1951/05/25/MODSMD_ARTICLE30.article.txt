# BULL SESSION

### DICK KLEIN 
Talking about getting mail. The PO had to send
over a whole mailbag the other day. And it's all be
cause Dick McLean has irritated so many of my read
ers. Seems that Dick wrote an article about George,
the Fiji mascot. Well, many of my fans have a bone
to pick.
Letters have been pouring in from Big Ked, Dav
enport, Kusty, Daniel, and all the others of the tire
biting crowd. Now don't get them wrong. They're
not rabble-rousers or anything of the sort. But they
feel they have a real right to become part of the
Stanford Tradition just as much as the Big Dog.
Especially Daniel, the well-groomed spaniel.
Everybody that's ever gone through frosh days at
Encina must have fed old Dan at least once. Not that
Dan is getting fat and lazy. But he sort of has a per
petual case of Spring Fever. It's nothing but eat, sleep,
and scratch Heas. Daniel's biggest moment came this
year when he chased a rabbit across the Stadium turf
before 40,000 thrilled fans. Coach Schwartz was so
impressed with the white-and-brown-and-black
coated cur's Hashy running ability that he wanted to
jign him up.
Dan's been to almost every Frosh Welcome As
sembly and Commencement at Frost, and he's
barked his loudest at all the rallies. And then this
quarter he helped with one candidate's speech at the
Election Kally at Mem And. lie's taken over 180
units worth of courses, specializing in lab courses
over in the bio dept. because they're the most nose
worthy curricula. But Daniel won't be able to grad
uate this year, even though he's been here three
years 011 the accelerated program. Seems that the
handsome mutt often forgets to come around to final
exams and has a slew of incompletes.
Anyway, Daniel just wanted me to let everybody
know that he'd be at the Spring Sing tonight, lie
pointed out that he's very interested in hearing the
Med School a&ain and judging whether they should

I
win another trophy. Then he just closed the letter, i
"Doggedly yours, Daniel D'Spaniel."
EXCOIVI ON THE BALL
Things have really been popping all over campus, j
and it's a pleasure to see some of the long-time stum
bling blocks uprooted. Take the Museum, for instance, j
All these years the place has been shut down. Some ;
of the grads-to-be never had a chance to go inside I
unless they were taking an art course until this year. J
Now after such a tremendous student reaction to the j
trial opening, plans are being formed to keep the relic- I
house open on a regular basis.
Then there's the Hoover Libe problem. Under Ex
commer Phil Saeta, who has done a bang-up job on j
lots of these thorny issues, Excofti is now preparing j
the Hoover Library Report. Even though it sounds j
like a little Congressional red-tape time, it is the way
things are getting done around here. Because it really
looks like the old Tower is going to be open to Sun
day visitors in the very near future.
And this will end a campaign that has been going
on for a long time. It also will make former Bull Ses
sioner Johnny Hall very happy. The "Closed Sunday" |
sign was Jawn's pet peeve.
LET'S PLAY BALL
Well, opportunity knocks, and we all have a chance
to really get behind that hard-working crew of ours, j
"Stanford Crew Night" at the Emeryville Baseball
Park next Tuesday p.m. Ls the time for the whole Farm
to show its sincere interest and support. It's been long
enough that the Indian oarsmen have meen monick
ered the "orphans." Granted that the Athletic De- '
partment can't help 'em.
But we can start the move ourselves bv turning out
for that game and filling up every seat in the ballpark.
The crew gets a third of the total gate receipts and
we'll all have an evening out and see the Oaks tiff
the Seattle Kainiers. Special tickets go on sale today
at Engineering Corner. Here's one line I'll be happy (o
stand in.

lots of these thorny issues, Excofti is now preparing j
the Hoover Library Report. Even though it sounds j
like a little Congressional red-tape time, it is the way
things are getting done around here. Because it really
looks like the old Tower is going to be open to Sun
day visitors in the very near future.
And this will end a campaign that has been going
on for a long time. It also will make former Bull Ses
sioner Johnny Hall very happy. The "Closed Sunday" |
sign was Jawn's pet peeve.
LET'S PLAY BALL
Well, opportunity knocks, and we all have a chance
to really get behind that hard-working crew of ours, j
"Stanford Crew Night" at the Emeryville Baseball
Park next Tuesday p.m. Ls the time for the whole Farm
to show its sincere interest and support. It's been long
enough that the Indian oarsmen have meen monick
ered the "orphans." Granted that the Athletic De- '
partment can't help 'em.
But we can start the move ourselves bv turning out
for that game and filling up every seat in the ballpark.
The crew gets a third of the total gate receipts and
we'll all have an evening out and see the Oaks tiff
the Seattle Kainiers. Special tickets go on sale today
at Engineering Corner. Here's one line I'll be happy (o
stand in.
Talking about getting mail. The PO had to send
over a whole mailbag the other day. And it's all be
cause Dick McLean has irritated so many of my read
ers. Seems that Dick wrote an article about George,
the Fiji mascot. Well, many of my fans have a bone
to pick.
Letters have been pouring in from Big Ked, Dav
enport, Kusty, Daniel, and all the others of the tire
biting crowd. Now don't get them wrong. They're
not rabble-rousers or anything of the sort. But they
feel they have a real right to become part of the
Stanford Tradition just as much as the Big Dog.
Especially Daniel, the well-groomed spaniel.
Everybody that's ever gone through frosh days at
Encina must have fed old Dan at least once. Not that
Dan is getting fat and lazy. But he sort of has a per
petual case of Spring Fever. It's nothing but eat, sleep,
and scratch Heas. Daniel's biggest moment came this
year when he chased a rabbit across the Stadium turf
before 40,000 thrilled fans. Coach Schwartz was so
impressed with the white-and-brown-and-black
coated cur's Hashy running ability that he wanted to
jign him up.
Dan's been to almost every Frosh Welcome As
sembly and Commencement at Frost, and he's
barked his loudest at all the rallies. And then this
quarter he helped with one candidate's speech at the
Election Kally at Mem And. lie's taken over 180
units worth of courses, specializing in lab courses
over in the bio dept. because they're the most nose
worthy curricula. But Daniel won't be able to grad
uate this year, even though he's been here three
years 011 the accelerated program. Seems that the
handsome mutt often forgets to come around to final
exams and has a slew of incompletes.
Anyway, Daniel just wanted me to let everybody
know that he'd be at the Spring Sing tonight, lie
pointed out that he's very interested in hearing the
Med School a&ain and judging whether they should

I
win another trophy. Then he just closed the letter, i
"Doggedly yours, Daniel D'Spaniel."
EXCOIVI ON THE BALL
Things have really been popping all over campus, j
and it's a pleasure to see some of the long-time stum
bling blocks uprooted. Take the Museum, for instance, j
All these years the place has been shut down. Some ;
of the grads-to-be never had a chance to go inside I
unless they were taking an art course until this year. J
Now after such a tremendous student reaction to the j
trial opening, plans are being formed to keep the relic- I
house open on a regular basis.
Then there's the Hoover Libe problem. Under Ex
commer Phil Saeta, who has done a bang-up job on j
lots of these thorny issues, Excofti is now preparing j
the Hoover Library Report. Even though it sounds j
