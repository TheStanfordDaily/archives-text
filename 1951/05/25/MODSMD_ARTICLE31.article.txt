## Brotherhood of Man

The brotherhood of man concept is certainly one of
mankinds greatest. it || US gathered increasing mo
mentum throughout the ages. And it is a develop
ment of Eastern as much as Western thought.
To many, the brotherhood of man is as practical as
it i\ idealistic, hut the use of either of these terms has
rarely ottered any aid in understanding the concept.
And almost as long as history is, the brotherhood con
cept which has been described by critics as either
idealistic or realistic, although the definitions of either
descriptive term have differed from person to person.
Almost as old as the thought itself has been the
claim by exponents that in the brotherhood concept
lies the salvation of the only race science ami re
ligion recognizes*—the human race.
Although 1 firmly believe in the concept as the basis
of my thinking, so much that it is probably my religion,
certain questions have always been raised in mind by
it. The logical extension of the "all men are my broth
ers" assumption has always seemed to be "love all
men equally."
Excluding the human delusions based on hatred,
fear and mistrust. I have wondered whether it is at
all possible to love all men equally, to believe and
feel sincerely that all men are my brothers.
The psychologists point to studies they have made
which seem to prove that it is a physical impossibility
lor a man in East Hedwood City to love a man in West
Hedwood City as much as he love; his own famly;
for that same man to love a man in Topeka as much as
thf man in West Hedwood City; to love a Korean,
North or South, as much as an American, Canadian,
or Latin American.
It appeals that the closer the other fellow is and the
closer his problems are to the man in East Redwood
City, the more capability the latter has for lovine the

men in question. To put it another way, the closer one
man is to another, either geographically or mentally,
the more real is the relationship, and the more poten
tial is the love. (I have often wondered if this works
conversely—substituting hate for love.)
I would wonder, too. whether the fact that the
uurld is smaller in relation to the gaps between the
man in Kedwood City and the Korean (the former
may at the present be fighting with or against the
latter) —1 wonder if this contraction of the world is
malting the principle of brotherhood more of a real
ity than it ever was.
Does the Indian's dependence on the American for
•Main during a lamine make it easier for the Indian to
love (or hate) the American? Does the Greek's de
pendence on the U.S. for arms to protect himself from
an aggression facilitate such lov»e (or hate, as the case
may be)?
Or does this raise other problems almost as deep
rooted? Problems that deal with the self-respect of
the Indian and the Greek; problem.'- that have a his
torical basis in the contemptuous treatment by tlx
Occidental lor the Oriental, the Caucasian for the non-
Caucasian?
Another question raised by this brotherhood con
cept has been whether its exponents have meant it
in the absolute or in the relative? When Jesus Christ
or lluddlni preached the love of all men. did they
mean it in sheer equality or as a matter of degree?
Somehow, 1 have always felt that their perception of
human nature was so great as to see the physical im
possibility of the former—equal love for all men -and
to see the possibility and desirability of the latter. I
think thty understood that only a small percentage
and maybe a growing proportion through time of all
mankind could approach the detached sainthood, lov
ing all men equally.
Hut they saw too, I believe, that it is within man's
potentialities to love all men—but wilh varying de
grees of intensity and concern. This may seem obviou
to many, but it is not clearly understood by most.
