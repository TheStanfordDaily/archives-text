The Kappa Sigs splashed their
way to a win in the intramural
swim meet held yesterday in the
Eneina Pools.
Star of the meet, however, was
Irwin Johnson, lone entrant of the
off-campus Royals. Johnson's three
firsts gave the Royals a third place,
behind the Kappa Sigs who had 21
points, and the DU's with 19.
There were no records broken in
the meet, although Johnson's :55.4
in a trial heat of the 100 was only
four-tenths of a second off.
The final scores—Kappa Sig, 21;
DU, 19; Off-Campus, 15; Phi Kaps,
12; Chi Psi, 9; Delts, 8; KA. 8; En
