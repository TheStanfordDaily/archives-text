## Spring Performances Fire Farmland Gridiron Hopes 
### PETE GROTHE 
By now the last battered football helmet and perspiration
drenched jersey have been stored away until fall, and one of the
questions phutball philberts are throwing around is, "What con
clusions can be drawn from spring practice?"
The coaching staff won't hazard any guesses as to how the '51

team will fare against PCC compe
tition, but it has come to many de
cisions regarding the personnel.
Linhackcr Ted Tanner, captain
of this year's championship frosh
team, was considered by the
coaches the top defensive pros
pect of the spring practice. Dutch
Fchring tabbed Leon (Humphrey
Pennyworth) King, the preaher
to-be, as the outstanding defen
sive lineman.
The showing of Harry Hugasian
struck one of the bright offensive
notes of the session. The Hipstcr
didn't live up to his sophomore
showings last year. The absence of
long-gone Emery Mitchell's block
ing is one of the reasons for this,
and an early-season injury is an
other. But Hugasian was at his
sophomoric best in the scrimmage
and should be an important factor
next year.
The big question is, "How will
Mathias do at fullback?" Fchring
answered this by saying, "A nat
ural athlete of his size and speed
might make a big difference in
our attack next year."
Fchring rates the end position as
the deepest, including the quarter
backs. Bill McColl is there, which
is as good a starting point as any.
Tracksters Bill Storum and Will
Taylor will also play offense, as
will freshman Sam Morlcy. Morley
has the knack of getting out into the
open, although he hasn't mastered
the art of blocking.
' Frosh John Steinberg and USC
transfer A 1 Kirkland arc also top
| raters, and may play defense. The
coaches rate Jack Rye "as good a
defensive end as there is on the
coast," and Ron Eadie and Dud
' Herschbach help to make the end
position very deep, indeed.
The tackle slot is an enigma.
I John Broderick, switched from
» defense to offense, has been look
ing solid as has ex-Brave Whitey
Pyle. Tab Dick Gant and Jim
' Vick also. King, freshman John
" Ludcke, speedy Boh Latham, and
? Barry Smith are the top defen
,' sive men.
Norm Manoogian and Jack Bo
netti, strictly defense last year, have
1 looked outstanding in the offensive
1 department. Big things arc also cx
' pected of Phil Wilson, muscular
guard from Los Angeles City Col
; lege. Owen Powell, first string last
» year, may have trouble breaking in.
Defensively, Jesse Cone should be
5 All - Coast. Rugged Dick Borda
should help as well as Rod Garner
1 and Tommy Romano.
Offensive center is rated weak
by the staff. Dave Worley, Doug j
! Thamer, Don Tobin, A 1 Robert- ;
! son, and Dick Stcere are the con- :
i tenders.
; Russ Pomeroy will be difficult to
- replace at linebacker, but '49 star
Gordy Rice has fully recovered
from a broken leg and was a demon
in spring drills. Tanner fits in here, ,
' as does Chuck Essegian, Bob Grif- j
fin, and Loren Hinkleman.
Dick Horn may play only de

fense next year. At the end of last
season he was Stanford's top de
fensive man. Joe St. Geme will be
back for more action, and Doug
Pinto and John Gilmore are vying
for safety.
Even without Horn, the quar
terback slot is solid as granite.
Gary Kerkorian takes his final
flin,g, backed by Bob Garrett, the
ace of the frosh team, and de
pendable Jack Bickel.
Hugasian, speedster Bobby Bryan,
and frosh Ron Cook give real savvy
to the left half post. Bryan can
stop on a dime and hand you nine
cents in change, and Cook is rated
the hardest running freshman since
Boyd Benson matriculated to the
Farm. Also tab "Tank" Tenerello
and Bob Hoegh.
If Eric Southwood throws off his
knee injury, he will undoubtedly
be one of the classiest runners in
the conference next year. If he
can't get into shape, Wes Laubscher
may be the first-string right half.
He was a powerhouse in spring
practice. Support will be given by
hulu-hipped Billy Heilbron, rugby
standout Jim Auble, and compact
Irv Gustafson.
The fullback post will be one
of (he most hotly contested posi
tions on (he squad. Five-yards
pcr-carry Bob Meyers will fi«ht it
out with Skip Crist and Mathias.
Add Griffin and Essegian, who
may be switched back to full
back, and Tony Garrett and Don
Day, and you have neck - high
depth.
That's the way the staff rates 'em.
What autumn - tide will bring is
anybody's guess.
