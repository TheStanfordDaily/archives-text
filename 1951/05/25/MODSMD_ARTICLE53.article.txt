# Plans for Student Union Feature 'Model Ciy'
## Million Dollar Plan May Begin in Year 
### JACK McDONALD 
Plans for an Alumni House, adjunct of the proposed new Stu
dent Union were approved by the Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee of the Board of Trustees last week. The plans were also on
display at Stanford's Alumni Conference, where they received
favorable comment. But that's not the whole story.

Plans for the new Union are mov
ing forward but are by no means
definite yet. Only one of the many
necessary steps of approval has been
taken toward beginning the three
unit, million-dollar project that will
one day give students what amounts
to a complete city in itself of stores,
services, and offices.
Site of the Alumni House will be
opposite the Firehouse. Plans call for
extensive reception space for return
ing alumni, including a patio and
loggia (a roofed open gallery), and
office space for the Alumni Associa
tion. More than $.'i5,000 has already
been raised for construction.
Three Units in Union
Present proposals for the Union in
clude three two-story units compris
ing the Tresidder Memorial Building,
the largest, and ASSU and cultural
centers.
Studies shown at left and right are
not alternative schemes. The final
product may represent a synthesis
combining the best features of each.
But the two contain similar elements
and are identical as to content of the
units.
Both schemes would build out from
the present Union, partially closing
off Santa Teresa street in harmony
with the peripheral road plan and
involving removal of the present in
adequate Post Otfice, the residence
on Lasuen across from that building,
and The Oaks.
Main feature of the Tresidder Me
morial is the planned 8,400-square
foot ballroom with terrace, catering
service facilities, and appurtenances,
'which is to cover the entire main
floor.
Recreation Center
Ground floor of the unit is to lie a
student recreation center with six
bowling alleys, and perhaps billiard
and ping-pong tables. With its ap
purtenances the center is to cover
17,150 square feet of floor space.
ASSU offices, general meeting
rooms, women's conference facilities,
and a service information center will
occupy the ground floor of the second
unit, according to present plans. The
I floor will also include a lost and

found department, ticket offices,
lobby and rest rooms, and possibly
debate offices.
The building's main floor will
house offices for Interfraternity
Council, Cardinals, and various clubs,
meeting rooms, and a gallery. Partial
counseling lacilities, a foreign schol
arship office, and publications center
are also possibilities.
The third unit, the cultural center,
is intended in part to relieve crowded
conditions in the libraries by provid
ing a browsing library with stacks
and reading room. It would also con
tain three large meeting rooms (com
bined floor space 2,000 square feet)
and a long (75-foot) terrace.
"Model City"
Tin? "model city" aspect of the
Union will include an enlarged Post
Office, Bookstore (increased one and
one-half present size), barber shop,
shoe repair shop, and candy and mag
azine counter—all on the order of
present services, but more closely re
lated in location.
In addition a sports shop, cleaning
and pressing service, beauty shop,
drug counter, and photography shop
have been suggested. Not included in
present flexible plans are KZSU fa
cilities, ceramics, photography, and
crafts.
Circulating traffic is to be excluded
from the Union area, though there
will be allowance for traffic to and
from the units.
Large parking areas will be pro
vided in the space behind Lower How
houses on the west side of Lasuen.
Greenery rather than buildings will
tie the units together architecturally,
and open spaces will be utilized as
pedestrian ways.
What's holding the project back?
The answer is an old one—money.
An estimated $1,100,000 will be re
quired for the entire project, the
Tresidder Memorial taking almost
half the amount.
While no one is willing yet to esti
mate a stalling date for the ASSU
and cultural units, planners are opti
mistic about beginning construction
on the Tresidder Memorial. Thomas
Spragens, assistant to President Ster

ling, expressed hope of getting un
derway "within a year," barring
material shortages or government
disapproval.
Sp ragens Optimistic
Spragens bases his optimistic fore
cast on present proposals which al
low piece by piece construction.
There is no need to wait until the
entire amount for the three units
raised before making any start, he
said.
At present, money is flowing in
from three sources: profits from the
present Union, one dollar assessments
from each student's tuition, and do
nations.
So far only function and locaton
of the Union have been discussed.
Achitectural plans have not been
decided on, though the style will har
monize essentially with Stanford's
traditional architecture and particu
larly with the present Union.
Someday . . . but present plans
indicate the Union will be well worth
waiting for.


ONE PROPOSAL—For the new Student Union places the large Tresidder Memorial unit (1) be
tween the cultural center (2) and the ASSU center (3). The buildings would be located West of the
present Union, designated in the large, irregular polygon near center of picture. Post Office,
Bookstore, and general stores are designated by the long vertical polygon at left.


TRESIDDER MEMORIAL (1) —In this proposal is located roughly at the site of the psent Post
Office. The cultural center (2) and ASSU unit (3) would be placed in the area acrossnd to the
south of the Firehouse. The long vertical rectangle at left represents proposed store are The new
Post Office is at lower left and the present Union in the approximate center of picture.
