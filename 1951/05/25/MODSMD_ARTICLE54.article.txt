# Internal Expansion May Increase Main Libe Space
## 
### 
A tentative plan for remodel
ing the Main Library building
shows that without gutting the
present structure usable space
could be increased by about 50
per cent.
One of the plan's general over-all
aims is to make books more readily
accessible to students and faculty
members. This is to be done by open
shell' lending rooms and the removal
of physical and administrative bar
riers between books and readers.
Underclassman Li be
Another aim is the creation of a
general education division, a select
open-shelf library for underclass
men. Planners feel th;it the under
classman has become the forgotten
man. Although he represents one
third of Stanford's enrollment, the
reserve book room is the only space
in the Main Libe set apart especially
for him.
Another part of the general plan is
the establishment of subject divisions
for upperclass, graduate, and faculty

u.se. Instead of the periodical, reserve
book, and reference rooms there will
ho open-shelf rooms containing fre
quently used materials in special
subject fields.
Final objectives include additional
.space for studies and seminar rooms
lor graduate students and faculty
members.
The general education 'library,
which will include the Western Civ
Libe, would be located on the first
floor, taking the place of the reserve
bonk room and the document room.
The rearrangement of the main
floor would permit conversion of the
Reference Room into an open-shell'
Humanities Library. The adjacent
area would house the social science
library, including government docu
ments, the transportation library, and
materials in those social sciences not
already provided with special library
facilities.
A new floor constructed at the
mezzanine level would furnish room
for the division of special collections
such as the Far Eastern collection,
and the Stanford collection.
