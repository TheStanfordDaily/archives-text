"Nothing is accidental. A building isn't just dropped," Dr. Ray i
Faulkner said with a smile.
He had just finished describing the work of the University's
Committee on Plant Development, and his description proved he
was right—there's a lot of positive, long-range planning behind

1 city-effect here that one feels at uni
versities like California or the Uni- j
versity of Chicago, he explained.
The money problem is one reason
j why the selection of building" sites j
might seem haphazard. Instead of
waiting until the money to complete
an entiie project is available, the
University often will build a unit at 1
j a time as funds come in.
The new electronics lab is a good !
example. It may seem to some to !
j have "just fallen" in back of the (
! Women's Gym. But in overall, long- j
range planning, it will eventually be
part of a science quad.
Building plans must also be flexible i
enough to allow for such things as
donations for .specific purposes.
When asked what his committee
would do if the unusual were to hap
pen and the school were to receive a
large sum with no strings attached, j
Faulkner replied that "making En
cina habitable" would probably re
ceive top priority. The Student
; Union and new dormitories would
also receive top attention.

might seem haphazard. Instead of

When asked what his committee
