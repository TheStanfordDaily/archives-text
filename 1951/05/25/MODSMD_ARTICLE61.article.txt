Eighty more students in the Stanford Law School will have a ,
lome on campus next fall as the result of the construction of two '
new v/ings on Crothers Hall, a project being financed by a dona
.io:i of Judge George E. Crothers.
Work on the 5348.000 dual-wing project, which began early in

November, is n:>w progressin 1 ahead
if the original :■ chcdule. Tins spced
ip has occurred despite a slowdown
in construction during late Decern-
Uer and early January because ol
leavy rains, according to Superin
tendent Loyd Crothers (no relation
~0 the donor).
At presi nt, workers are plastering
uul putting the trims on the south
ving, while partitions are being
jrected on the north win;;' o! the
building.

83 feet, tinning the Law School
dormitory into a U-shaped build
ing. Each of t'.ie new wings will
contain 20 two-man rooms, with
basement Moors to be used for trunk
storatfe and a laundry room.
Builders are Wagner and Martinez,
the same firm that constructed the
original hall two and one-half years
ago. The architects were University
Planning' Director Eldridge T. Spen
cer and William C. Ambrose, while
the structural engineer is Professor
ol Civil Engineering James B. Wells.
The permanent working force of 3G
carpenters and laborers employed by
the construction firm is supplemented
by a varying complement of plaster
ers, glaziers, steam-fitters, and
plumbers.
A breakdown of the cost of the
project shows that $285,000 is being
spent for the actual construction,
while the remaining $G3,000 will be
used for furnishings and landscaping.
The capacity of Crothers Hall
will he boosted to 153 by the addi
tion of the wings, which comprise
approximately one-third of the
total Law School enrollment.
Forjudge Crothers, who graduated
from Stanford in the pioneer class of
1895, the new wings will come as his
second afterthought. Earlier, he de
cided to make a library out of the
basement of the dormitory—which is
now in student use.—Phil Wilcox
