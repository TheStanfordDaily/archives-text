# Microwave Labs

### 
The two new electronic laborato
ries under construction behind Se
quoia Hall facing the west side of
the Quad are proceeding "on sched
ule" despite material shortages, and
should be completed by mid-Au
gust. Representing an outlay of
$23,000, the labs will provide facili
ties for applied research and stu

dent electrical engineering work.
'1 lie research lab, started by an
Office of Naval liesearch grant of I
an undisclosed amount, will be ad- j
joined in the form of a wing by the j
student lab. Construction of the !
latter was made possible by a pi ft
from the Hewlett-Packard Co., lo- J
cal electronics equipment manufac
turing firm headed by William
Hewlett ant David Packard. Stan
lord graduates of the class of '34.
the student laboratory wing will
include classrooms, laboratories,
ind workshops where student ; can
cany out unsponsored research, a I
library, and a lounge.
'file buildings are being con- j
structed of concrete blocks and will j
have slightly slopinit roofs similar j
to the Microwave Laboratory. They
are another step in the direction of
the eventual Science Quad, which '
someday will contain buildings for
chemistry, physics, and biology.
