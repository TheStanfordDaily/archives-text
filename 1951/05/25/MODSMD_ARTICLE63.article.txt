The smell of boiiing tar and the 1
sight of ropes and buckets greets j 112
the "sidewalk supervisor" of the j t
new eating club building on the j
east side ol the campus these days, j s
The roofing process is just one of j I
several jobs under way as con true- | I
tors maintain progress toward their J I
completion date of July 31- j i
Vance Biown, Palo Alto contrac- j;
tor, has a crew of 17 men working 1 i
on various jobs from siding to porch | 1
trim, while subcontractors are fin- I 1
ishing gas and water lines, electri- j
cal conduits, and applying a primer j !
coat of paint.
After the building itself is com- |
pleted in July, equipment will be 1
installed and everything readied I -
for the occupancy of Stanford's sev-

en eating clubs at the beginning of
autumn quarter.
Each club will have its own din- !
ing room with a capacity of 48 men.
The structure, with its 14.000 square
leet of floor space, will also include j
separate kitehjens and cooks' quar
ters.
Situated at the corner of the L- I
shaped building is the central j
lounge for the use of all the clubs.
Its hardwood floors, pressed-brick I
fireplace, and central location make j
it very suitable for dances and other j
social functions. Doors connecting I
it to the two adjoining clubrooms J
further enhance its adaptability for j
these purposes.
The building was designed by j
San Francisco architects Weihe, j
Frick, and Kruse. Together with j
landscaping, utilities, walks, equip- J
ment, and furnishings, the total cost
of the structure will exceed 5200.000.
