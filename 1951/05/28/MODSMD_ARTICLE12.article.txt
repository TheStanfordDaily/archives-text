# Campus Speedster Gives School Child Close Call
## 
### 
"It's time people slowed down!"
These were the words of a har
ried mother after a near accident
involving a little hoy at the inter
section of Mayfield Avenue and
Santa Ynez Street a few days ago.
This is the intersection in front of
the Stanford Elementary School.
The boy was escorting some of
his fellow students across the street,
his upraised hand hearing a large
yellow sign with the word "STOP"
printed in big black letters.
Before the group of children
could get across the street, a speed
ine car bore down fin the group,
knocking the sign out of the hoy's
hand.

Despite the fact, that the area is
a .school zone and despite the signs
reading "Slow to 15 miles per hour,"
cars have been clocked traveling
through the intersection at 50 miles
an hour.
That is why Police Chief Gordon
Davis has an officer parked at the
intersection every day watching for
traffic violators.
Not all traffic violators have been
students or University employees.
A particularly dangerous time of
day is after 11 o'clock classes when
there is heavy traffic on the Row.
The children at the elementary
school get out of class at about the
same time.
