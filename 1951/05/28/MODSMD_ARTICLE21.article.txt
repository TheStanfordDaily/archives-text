# Salgo, Flayers In Outstanding Performance
## 
### ART BLOOMFIELD 
The Stanford Symphony Orches
tra under Sandor Salgo's direction
gave an outstanding concert at Me
morial Auditorium last night — a
concert which should have filled the
hall. The program was so well
brought off, in fact, that it would be
very difficult to imagine a finer
student, non-professional orchestra.
The numbers plaved were not
easy—Brahms' first symphony, a
piece which requires a big. rich,
yet controlled tone; Ravel's
"Mother Goose," which, on the
other hand, asks for the greatest
delicacy of projection; and Ber
lioz' "Benvcnuto Cellini" Over
ture. which is virtuoso orchestral
fireworks of the first order.
The orchestra, however, found
such music well within their abili
ties. The strings were smooth and
disciplined, the winds mellow and
not overblown. The musicians' tal
ents, Professor Salgo's sensitivity to
balance, and the intelligent staging
of the performance—half of the or
chestra was before the proscenium
—all combined to produce the fine
sound we heard.
Mr. Salgo should be cited not only
for his control of sound but also for
his forthright interpretations which
avoided the theatricalism of Ro
mantic conductors.
.Me is a conductor who doesn't
fall into the rilardandn bog which
claims many Brahms interpreters
in particular. His music moves—
it is simple and direct.
The soloists on last night's pro
gram were Lawrence Mason, tenor,
remembered for his performances
in last quarter's opera productions,
and Nancy Kronburg, soprano, a
finalist in the Kent compe
tition. They were the capable pro
tagonists in two arias from Mozart's
"Don Giovanni": "II Mio Tcsoro"
and "Non Mi Dir."
Particularly worthy of note was
Miss Kronburg''s creditable traver
sal of the exceedingly difficult fiiori
tura at the close of "Non Mi Dir."
