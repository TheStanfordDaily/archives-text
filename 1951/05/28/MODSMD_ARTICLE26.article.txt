# We'll Take the Honor Code
## 
### 
Last Saturday morning, we went over to take
the Selective Service Aptitude Test, the gov
ernment's newest measuring rod for temporary
deferment of college students.
The exam was proctored, avowedly because
the Educational Testing Service, which admin
isters the tests for the government, was "unim
pressed" with Stanford's Honor Code system.
In one of the larger test rooms, where we
ended up, there were five proctors patrolling
the aisles. If you were unlucky enough to be
sitting on the aisle, you couldn't help but see
the proctor out of the corner of your eye every
time he passed your desk. You knew, too, that
the same measured strides would return in an
other live minutes.
Just after the test had begun, one student
started to remove his watch. Two proctors
watched his every movement and, of course,
the student felt a little embarrassed. After all,
there might have been some crib notes beneath
the wristband, or tacked to its underside. You
never know.
Another student bent over to tie his shoe
laces. The proctor bent over with him, because
he was being paid to do things like that. But to
the student, the proctor's tactics were almost
pathetically humorous.
We're not saying the proctors were at the test
for no reason at all. They were there because

the Educational Testing Service isn't allowed to
distinguish between one group of students and
another. Uniformity of test conditions, we're
told, puts everyone on an egual competitive
basis.
But the presence of the guards at last Satur
day's three-hour trial was peculiarly illustrative
of the kind of thing that goes on every day at
most other colleges.
Call it what you will, say it's hard to define.
but there's something great about going to a
test and knowing someone won't be breath
ing down your neck every minute.
The Honor Code was started at Stanford more
than 30 years ago, at a time when very few
people — educators as well as students — be
lieved it possible.
Today there is still a majority who think the
system won't work. You ask them to try it out
at their schools, and they are immediately afraid
of the consequences. "It'll never work at our
place." they say.
But that's just the point. An honor code
doesn't get going overnight. It takes time, and
the longer you work at it, the better it gets.
Deferments or no, all of us can thank last Sat
urday's little drama in the classroom for show
ing us why we have a special right to blow off
steam about our Honor Code, why the words
"honor code" and "proctor" just don't sound
good in the same sentence.
