# ONE STUDENT'S VIEWPOINT
## Just Hoping Isn't Enough 
### Editor's Note: This is the last in a series of articles by Gil Jonas, off-campus Excom representative.) By GIL JONAS 
No system oi' thought can successfully espouse ulti
mate brotherhood, social welfare, the dignity of Man
kind at the expense of these goals save in the short
run. A philosophy that exalts Mankind while ignor
ing man does not appear workable, if only because by
its very concrete example, it contradicts its avowed
ends.
Such a system may well bring economic improve
ment in the form of a minimum material subsistence
level. But this necessary material base, embellished
with socially-conscious slogans, in itself seems to
father the development of a natural inner drive for
human self-determination. (Often only the prospect of
the minimum base can catalyze this drive.)
But, in the words of the patron of one of these sys
tems of thought, it may have "the seeds of its own
destruction" within itself, for once this assertion of
human dignity has passed its puberty, its adherents
lind the expedient totalitarianistic restraints too un
bearable to ignore.
This error in human understanding and inherent
worth is* one of the pitfalls of the Communist Party's
methods—and in the methods of all rigid. doctrinaire
systems of thought. From the days of Samson on up
to the self-assertion of colonially-bound peoples in
Asia and Africa of today, we are witnessing the same
process—and the bogeyman in the form of the Com
munist Party is merely capitalizing on what was in
evitably to be.
It is probably best evidenced among the intellectual
adherents to such a philosophy, becau.se their appre
ciation lor freedom of conscience and expression is
more acutely developed (although often repressed by
semantical rationalizations). But witness the high in
cidence of men like Silone, Luther, Socrates, and Vol
taire throughout history. They .seem to best sym
bolize man's reflexive rebellion against authoritarian
tfiought.
Too often we in America make the mistake of think
ing that in today's market of ideas the Russians—and
the Communists—have cornered the market on the
"ends-jystifying-the-meaps" approach. It confuses
me and many millions not residing within our bor
ders—to hear this principle decried on the one hand
and utilized on the other to prevent"dangerous ele
ments" from utilizing it.
1 am bewildered Ly the duplicity of the American
senator who can. in the same speech, denounce "Sov
iet imperialism" and demand political benefits for
the I'nited States before a shipment of surplus
wheat is granted to famine-ridden Indians.
Rather than a Russian monopoly, this seems more
to be an aspect—pi obably acquired—of what we like
to call, in our intellectual haste, human nature.
Whether this characteristic of our nature can be
changed over years or whether it is here to stay is not

the most crucial problem at the moment. Mass change
in human nature—despite its predominant environ
mental molding—is too slow a process for a world of
men faced with the alternatives of one world fairly
soon (in the historical sense) or two worlds quickly—
and then possbly none.
'loday we tend to regard Marxists as "stark realists"
—yet their ultimate goal is based on a radical change
in human behavior; that of achieving a classless so
ciety under which men can adjust their affairs without
the need of a government. Without denying the ulti
mate possibility of such an arrangement, I am still
puzzled by our almost concomitant estimation of those
advocating world federal government—we call them
(among other things) "starry-eyed idealists."
Yet world federalists advocate a structural set-up
that admits human nature will not radically alter for
soine time to come; that humans (and the nation
states through which human in-groups manifest
their behavior) need government to regulate their
conflicting interests without resorting to the waste
ful folly and horrifying spectacle of war.
Since institutional change—like world federation or
American federation—is brought about purely through
the acts of men— it is a "man-made" alternation—then
it seems to follow that only when men start desiring it
enough and working to fulfill that desire will it come
about. And no amount of rationalization of the type
that says "But we are not ready for it" will prevent its
coming about. (I often wonder whether those who
claim "others" are not ready for it, are not them
selves the ones entirely unprepared.)
Moreover, the Llind reliance on the almost mystical
process of Evolution seems a bit like begging the
question. There is either slow evolution or fast evo
lution. Or there is, unless you define revolution as
"change with violence," slow revolution or fast revo
lution'. These abstractions really prove futile, for we,
as humans, are constantly changing, for good or bad—
regardless of the degree or intensity.
Evolution (or change) is brought about by the inter
acting chain of human acts and events. If we want an
institutional change, we are obliged to participate in
the advocacy ot it, since this is our small share of the
otherwise omniscient diety of Evolution.
'Lite ideal of brotherhood will never conic about by
hoping for it. Just as in the past with all great
changes in spiritual attitudes, it will reach a point
where its institutional counterparts will be put forth
by mortal men in an effort to further fulfill the ideal.
To the social scientist this is known as Che interac
tion of concomitants.
It occurs to me as I attempt to wrap this up that no
amount ol ego-assertion by college seniors in college
dailies will bring this about. In a sense, such ranting is
1 utile, for all it seems to produce is lip-service agree
ment. Without a dynamic course of action, such in
tellectual gestures of rapport can well die the death
of a mere sophomoric discussion.
