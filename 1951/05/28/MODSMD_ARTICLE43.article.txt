## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
The long-awaited PCC track meet trials, postponed by the draft
test last Saturday, will get under way in the Coliseum today with
representatives of the nine PCC schools competing for places in
tomorrow's finals.
Stanford's 18-man team, which lacks the individual stars of last

year's second - pLce aggregation,
will have to count on depth if they
j are to take second again this year.
The Indians' leading rivals for
the second spot behind heavy fa-
I vorite USC are Washington State,
which was the Northern Division
i winner, Cal, and UCLA.
The Cards' ace discus thrower,
Boli Mathias, is Stanford's only pre
i meet favorite. Mathias threw a
| "best-ever" 162—ft. IOV-j-in. toss at
Modesto last weekend, and will be
i gunning for the PCC meet record
of 170 it. 10% in. made by Stanlord's
Ld Levy in 1930.
Will Taylor, Stanford's top 220
\ man, has an outside chance of win
ning his event, but will be up
against plenty of competition, in
cluding UCLA's Hob Work and Hod
Kichard, Cal's Jim Flessas, and
Oregon State's Meiv Brock.
Brock. incidentally, won both
. sprints in the Northern Division
meet held at Washington State Sat
! urday. His 100-yard dash time was
9.7 and he won the 220 in 21.7.
The Indians' ace shot put trio,
composed of Lew Davis, Chuck Ifo
kanson, and Bob iVlathias, hope to


WILBUR TAYLOR —The Cards'
ace 220 man will be counted on
heavily for points in this year's
PCC track meet.
