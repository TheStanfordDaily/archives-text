# 1,500 Take Draft Examination Here â€”With Proctors
## 
### 
"Not too difficult, but rough
enough to keep you working for a
solid three hours," was the general
consensus after Saturday's draft
deferment test.
Almost one-third of the test em
phasized mathematics, a fact, par
ticularly noticeable to the liberal
arts majors among the 1,500 who
took the test.
The test was unusual to Stanford
students in another way, since gov
ernment regulations required proc
tors to patrol the rooms where the
exam was being held.
Students in one group got another
taste of federal "efficiency." In an
effort to follow every rule minutely
even when the test, started 45 min
utes late, one head proctor had the
students turn their watches back to
0 o'clock, the official starting time.
