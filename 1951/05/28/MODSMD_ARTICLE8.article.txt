lon sang "Sit Down Servant" to win
the mixed division.
"Invocation" brought the novelty
trophy to the Hindustan students,
who came within one point of tying
with the Med School.
Only the winners were an

It would seem that Davenport,
noted campus pooch, has a talent
for picking winners; for he ap
peared on stage to inspect both the
Hindustan students and the School
of Nursing during their singing.
Dow Carpenter was master of
ceremonies at the sing, which ended
somewhat earlier than expected due
to the withdrawal of several groups
the last day.

returned to sing "Cruisin' in My
Model 'I" at the end of the program
while the judges were making their
