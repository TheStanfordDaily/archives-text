The Stanford Art Gallery has cur
rently on exhibit a group of the New
Orleans photographer's pictures. The

foreign magazines.
He began his photographic career

determination to work with the cam

mystery of light" and the conviction
that the camera can be used as an
instrument to explore the mind of
man.
