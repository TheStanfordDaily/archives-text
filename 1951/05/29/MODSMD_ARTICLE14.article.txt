A swarm of bees alighted from
their hive and buzzed around In
ner Quad yesterday afternoon
without bothering to sting any of
the onlookers from nearby 2
o'clock classes.
The only approaching tragedy,
wheti Phil Neilsen, Farm senior,
began a heedless cycle into the
swarming stingers, was averted
by a shout of warning from the
onlookers.
The bees finally gave up their
circular procession behind the
"queen" and took off to get a
whiff of the flowers.
