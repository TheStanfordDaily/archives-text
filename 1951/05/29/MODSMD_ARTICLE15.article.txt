# Child Rescued From Creek By Student
## 
### 
J. Mutton Taylor, Deke geography
major, rescued a small gjrl from
drowning in Alameda Creek
Niles Sunday morning during a ge
ography field trip.
The class was standing on the
edge of the road beside the creek
listening to the instructor talk
about the local geology, while sev
eral small children from a nearby
tent-camp were playing along the
edge of the water.
Suddenly Taylor, hearing a cry
for help, dropped his books and ran
down the bank, pulling off his shirt
as he went. He jumped in and
pulled the small girl to shore. After
a few moments she was able to
walk home.
Two small boys who had been
playing with the girl had tried to
rescue her, while other people in
the camp had ignored her cries. The
girl's parents were not present.
