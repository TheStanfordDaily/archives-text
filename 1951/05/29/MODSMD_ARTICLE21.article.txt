# Lighting Affects Library Room Popularity

"Why don't they put better
lights in the Library Along
with complaints about the cam
pus roads and hikes in tuition
this question has arisen year
after year.
Several weeks ago a couple of the
| members of the Student Health
Committee paid a visit to R. C.
I Swank, director of the University
] Libraries to see what he could tell
them about the situation. How in
adequate is the lighting now, they
: asked. What can l:e done to improve
it, especially in the main reading
room upstairs? Arc there any plans
now?
Library Concern
After talking with Dr. Swank, the
Health Committee representatives
I were quite relieved to learn that he
does not own an interest in Bauseh
and Lomb. nor does he sell eye
glasses in his spare hours. In fact, he
seemed almost more concerned about
the problem than they.
The Library authorities feel, ac
cording to Dr. Swank, that maximum
use is not being made of tljc Library
at this time. And he does not attrib-
J utc this wholly to student inertia,

but rather to many factors involved I
in the actual physical plant. Among
thrni is the lighting.
To hack lip this point he cited fig- j
ures showing relative use of large
rooms in the Library with reference
to their capacity arul to their light
ing facilities.
For instance, in spring quarter i
IMD the Reserve Book Room, with j
a seating capacity of 170, had an aver
age daily attendance of 78 and a
maximum of 195. By contrast aver- i
age attendance in the reference room
which has a capacity of 308, was only
f>o and the maximum recorded there i
was lf?2.
Reserve Book Room Lighting
The Reserve Book Room is fitted
with modern fluorescent lights which
give the room approximately 35 foot
candles of illumination at desk top
height. The original lights which still
remain in the Reference Room give
about 15 font-candles at desk height. !
This example alone illustrates the I
importance of adequate lighting to
the use of a room for study purposes. ;
But when it comes to the actual
changing of lighting facilities, the
project is not as simple as it might
sound. First we might mention that
there arc plans afopt for a complete
remodeling of several sections to in
crease the usable space in the Li- I

brary. In these sections any lighting
changes will have to wait until the
architectural remodeling is under
way.
That this is a long-range project
which must wail until the funds are
forthcoming, goes without saying.
Business Manager Alf Brandin also
reminded us that other construction
and remodeling jobs are slated for
the near future. These are such as
re-doing the classrooms on Inner
Quad which can be done piecemeal
as relatively small amounts of money
are obtained. The Library must wait
for a large very large—lump sum.
Reference Room Lighting
But what, about the Reference
Room, with its large potential as a
study room and its poor lights? It is
part of this long-range project? No.
we are told, there will bo no architec
tural changes made there, so the
lighting could be changed in that
room independent of any other plans.
Even this one room is an immense
engineering and architectural prob
lem. These problems are being
tackled right, now in the Planning
Office. Those of wiring, changing fix
tures, and preserving the looks of the
room can be surmounted finite rap
idly.
But the old bug-a-boo Ls still there.
No mutter how fine the blueprints arc

j they cannot be followed without
j funds and construction materials. A
university's income for such projects
I comes mainly from alumni donations.
And apparently most of those who
i decide to leave a few thousand would
rather see it. go for a brand new
building instead of keeping up pros- i
j cut. facilities.
Lack of Materials
Not- is it easy to obtain materials,!
especially copper for electric wiring,
since more and more is being di- j
verted for military purposes.
Eldridge T. Spencer, director of j
| planning, offered some interesting j
information, however, about what is
involved from the engineering and j
architectural standpoint in changing
the lights in the Reference Room of
the Main Library.
For daytime lighting the most an
noying feature in that particular
room is the contrast in brightness of
the interior lighting and the sunlight
and reflections from the windows, !
Ibis could be remedied hy draping
the windows or by changing the type
! of class.
Then for lx>th day and night use
the artificial lighting would have to
bo increased in intensity from ap
proximately 15 foot-candles where it
now stands to about 10 foot-candles, j
I The tow most feasible plans for do- I

ins this would ho, According to Spen
cer, to install fluorescent lights of the ;
type now in the Reserve Book Room ;
or to put in new incandescent lights
with hii egg-crate shield. 'Die latter is
the type now in the Stern Hall
lounges.
In order to obtain proper illumina
tion at de.sk lop level, the fluorescent j
lights would have to be installed at
about 10 feet above the tables. Ar
chitectually this would look ridicu
lous in a room with as high a ceiling
as the Reference Room.
Ventilation Problem
The egg-crate shield type is for that
reason among others most favored at ,
the present time. The main problem
involved with it, besides installing
new electrical wiring to carry the in
creased load, Is one of ventilation.
Incandescent lighting creates a great
deal of heat which would have to he
diverted by some sort of air-condi- |
tioning
Spencer said that enough of the
basic planning has heen done at this
time so that the job could be com
pleted in a few months if the money
and materials could lie found. Me
estimated the cost at somewhere
around $10,000.
The floor Is open to suggestion as
to how to surmount this biggest re
maining problem.

Reserve Book Room Lighting
The Reserve Book Room is fitted
with modern fluorescent lights which
give the room approximately 35 foot
candles of illumination at desk top
height. The original lights which still
remain in the Reference Room give
about 15 font-candles at desk height. !
This example alone illustrates the I
importance of adequate lighting to
the use of a room for study purposes. ;
But when it comes to the actual
changing of lighting facilities, the
project is not as simple as it might
sound. First we might mention that
there arc plans afopt for a complete
remodeling of several sections to in
crease the usable space in the Li- I

brary. In these sections any lighting
changes will have to wait until the
architectural remodeling is under
way.
That this is a long-range project
which must wail until the funds are
forthcoming, goes without saying.
Business Manager Alf Brandin also
reminded us that other construction
and remodeling jobs are slated for
the near future. These are such as
re-doing the classrooms on Inner
Quad which can be done piecemeal
as relatively small amounts of money
are obtained. The Library must wait
for a large very large—lump sum.
Reference Room Lighting
But what, about the Reference
Room, with its large potential as a
study room and its poor lights? It is
part of this long-range project? No.
we are told, there will bo no architec
tural changes made there, so the
lighting could be changed in that
room independent of any other plans.
Even this one room is an immense
engineering and architectural prob
lem. These problems are being
tackled right, now in the Planning
Office. Those of wiring, changing fix
tures, and preserving the looks of the
room can be surmounted finite rap

tion at de.sk lop level, the fluorescent j
lights would have to be installed at

The egg-crate shield type is for that

the present time. The main problem

estimated the cost at somewhere

"Why don't they put better

this question has arisen year
after year.
Several weeks ago a couple of the
| members of the Student Health
Committee paid a visit to R. C.
I Swank, director of the University
] Libraries to see what he could tell
them about the situation. How in
adequate is the lighting now, they
: asked. What can l:e done to improve
it, especially in the main reading
room upstairs? Arc there any plans
now?
Library Concern
After talking with Dr. Swank, the
Health Committee representatives
I were quite relieved to learn that he
does not own an interest in Bauseh
and Lomb. nor does he sell eye
glasses in his spare hours. In fact, he
seemed almost more concerned about
the problem than they.
The Library authorities feel, ac
cording to Dr. Swank, that maximum
use is not being made of tljc Library
at this time. And he does not attrib-
J utc this wholly to student inertia,

but rather to many factors involved I
in the actual physical plant. Among
thrni is the lighting.
To hack lip this point he cited fig- j
ures showing relative use of large
rooms in the Library with reference
to their capacity arul to their light
ing facilities.
For instance, in spring quarter i
IMD the Reserve Book Room, with j
a seating capacity of 170, had an aver
age daily attendance of 78 and a
maximum of 195. By contrast aver- i
age attendance in the reference room
which has a capacity of 308, was only
f>o and the maximum recorded there i
was lf?2.
Reserve Book Room Lighting
The Reserve Book Room is fitted
with modern fluorescent lights which
give the room approximately 35 foot
candles of illumination at desk top
height. The original lights which still
remain in the Reference Room give
about 15 font-candles at desk height. !
This example alone illustrates the I
importance of adequate lighting to
the use of a room for study purposes. ;
But when it comes to the actual
changing of lighting facilities, the
project is not as simple as it might
sound. First we might mention that
there arc plans afopt for a complete
remodeling of several sections to in
crease the usable space in the Li- I

brary. In these sections any lighting
changes will have to wait until the
architectural remodeling is under
way.
That this is a long-range project
which must wail until the funds are
forthcoming, goes without saying.
Business Manager Alf Brandin also
reminded us that other construction
and remodeling jobs are slated for
the near future. These are such as
re-doing the classrooms on Inner
Quad which can be done piecemeal
as relatively small amounts of money
are obtained. The Library must wait
for a large very large—lump sum.

But what, about the Reference
Room, with its large potential as a
