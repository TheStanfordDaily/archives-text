# Penalty Lightened For Late Sign-out
## 
### 
Women's Council yesterday light
ened the penalty for signing out
| from a residence after closing hours.
The penalty of one offense will be
civen for the violation instead of
the one offense plus demerit pen
alty for minutes out of the resi
j dence. The new ruling will go into
effect next fall quarter. "The latter
penalty seemed far too severe for
the offense commit ted." Jane Trox
ell, AWS president, said.
Women's Council reminded that
late leaves must be used through
I June 13, but late leaves will not be
necessary for the activities held
| after that Hate.
