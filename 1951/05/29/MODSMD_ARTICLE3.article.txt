WASHINGTON â€” Uf./i. Hoyt S.
Vandenberg warned today against ]
wasting the "shoestring" U.S. Air 1
Force in an expanded war with
Communist China because airpower j
is the only thing that keeps Russia j
from starting World War 111.
Vandenberg surprised aviation
industry circles and even some of
his subordinates by asserting that j
the Russian MIG-15 fighter has a j
engine superior to anything pos- |
.scssed by the United States.
