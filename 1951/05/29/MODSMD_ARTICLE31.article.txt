# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
OJ SPKINti SIN(iS AND CIIILDKKN and such
Like the Ntw York Yankees in u World Series, likt*
Franklin D. Roosevelt in a presidential election, like
ilu j Med School in the Spring Sing . . .
Yt.s, everything went according to schedule . . .

well, almost according to schedule,
in lust Friday's Spring Sing. The
IVled School deservedly copped the
Sweepstakes Trophy, and the
School of Nur.iing was named in
the women's division.
Although the School ol Nurs
ing's medley was very ear-pleas
ing, it seemed to me that any one
ol a number of women's groups
could have broken the Florence
Nightingales' monopoly.

Union's rendition of "Li/,a" was flawless; Ventura
did real justice to "Birth of the Blues"; the pink
rhetked Koble-ites were in there pitching with "Pagan
Love Song"; and Russell, Lathrop, and Storey's version
ol "Oceana Roll" and "Row, Row, Bow" was positively
racy. Outline, Stillman. and Ilurlburt, looking like a
giant inging centipede with 100 bare legs, gave real
class to "I've Got Rhythm."
Th<e number not on the schedule that almost broke
up the show wa.s little Rachel and Albert's wailing
duet of "I Want My Mommie."
Just as the Phi Kaps went into "One Meat Hall,"
Rachel, about 4, and Albert, ;i. began wandering
alohg the aisle (tying for their mother. While the
Phi K.ap:, were Joshua through (lie battle of

Jericho, Rachel began screaming louder, carrying
the Soprano lead part. Albert did his sobbing in
tenor, sounding like someone sucking his foot out of
a bucket of yogurt.
By the time Ventura had rolled into "Birth of the
Blues," Rachel had shifted into a Lily Pons lyric so
prano of "I Want My Mommie." Albert, who was
plumb tuckered out from crying, made a few inco
herent sputterings, and then let Rachel solo it.
Master of Ceremonies Dow Carpenter later located
their parents.
AI TFIt HKARING the Theta Xi cuiartet, 1 know
what killed vaudeville. And after hearing the Ger
man group sing, 1 know what killed Hitler. But ac
tually, they were quite good.
The biggest diappointment of the night was tlie
failure of the Phi Psis to intone "Old Soldiers Never
Die," I was all ready to whip across the stage, lieat
my chest, and bellow "I Shall Return!"
The Theta Delts deserved some sort of prize for
imagination for their hilarious version of "It's Been
Good to Know You." Lag showed pleasing harmony
in "Lazybones," and SAK and Madrono's euphonious
singing of "Sit Down, Servant" deserved the award
it got.
The best number of all, though, was (lie conclud
ing song, the Stanford Hymn, sung l>v the whole
ft,ooo.
For my money, the Spring Sing is Stanford's very
best tradition. And 1 think there were more than a
few who got a tingling feeling inside when they raised
their voices to the warm evening sky in the final
hymn.

Yt.s, everything went according to schedule . . .

well, almost according to schedule,
in lust Friday's Spring Sing. The
IVled School deservedly copped the
Sweepstakes Trophy, and the
School of Nur.iing was named in
the women's division.
Although the School ol Nurs
ing's medley was very ear-pleas
ing, it seemed to me that any one
ol a number of women's groups
could have broken the Florence
Nightingales' monopoly.

Union's rendition of "Li/,a" was flawless; Ventura
did real justice to "Birth of the Blues"; the pink
rhetked Koble-ites were in there pitching with "Pagan
Love Song"; and Russell, Lathrop, and Storey's version
ol "Oceana Roll" and "Row, Row, Bow" was positively
racy. Outline, Stillman. and Ilurlburt, looking like a
giant inging centipede with 100 bare legs, gave real
class to "I've Got Rhythm."
Th<e number not on the schedule that almost broke
up the show wa.s little Rachel and Albert's wailing
duet of "I Want My Mommie."
Just as the Phi Kaps went into "One Meat Hall,"
Rachel, about 4, and Albert, ;i. began wandering
alohg the aisle (tying for their mother. While the
Phi K.ap:, were Joshua through (lie battle of

Jericho, Rachel began screaming louder, carrying
the Soprano lead part. Albert did his sobbing in
tenor, sounding like someone sucking his foot out of
a bucket of yogurt.
By the time Ventura had rolled into "Birth of the
Blues," Rachel had shifted into a Lily Pons lyric so
prano of "I Want My Mommie." Albert, who was
plumb tuckered out from crying, made a few inco
herent sputterings, and then let Rachel solo it.
Master of Ceremonies Dow Carpenter later located
their parents.
AI TFIt HKARING the Theta Xi cuiartet, 1 know
what killed vaudeville. And after hearing the Ger
man group sing, 1 know what killed Hitler. But ac
tually, they were quite good.
The biggest diappointment of the night was tlie
failure of the Phi Psis to intone "Old Soldiers Never
Die," I was all ready to whip across the stage, lieat
my chest, and bellow "I Shall Return!"
The Theta Delts deserved some sort of prize for
imagination for their hilarious version of "It's Been
Good to Know You." Lag showed pleasing harmony
in "Lazybones," and SAK and Madrono's euphonious
singing of "Sit Down, Servant" deserved the award
it got.
The best number of all, though, was (lie conclud
ing song, the Stanford Hymn, sung l>v the whole
ft,ooo.
For my money, the Spring Sing is Stanford's very
best tradition. And 1 think there were more than a
few who got a tingling feeling inside when they raised
their voices to the warm evening sky in the final
hymn.
