# Who, Who, WHO???

To the Editor:
In my letter printed last Tuesday, I asked how many
Stanford students went up to Sacramento to lobby and
what were their names? In Thursday's Daily Hank
Vilas says "There never has been any secrecy about
.. . who went ..." »
Well, who were tliey? It is unnecessary to tell us if
they love their mothers, say their prayers every night,
and are pretty good "Joes"; just tell us who they were.
If Vilas won't tell, perhaps the person who wrote the
articles which occupied so much space in the Daily
might say.
Maybe there isn't any secrecy about who went, but
some people don't seem* to know. Ask the person(s)
next to you in class if they know!
MARVIN O. ADAMS
(The students were Vilas. Lois Deimel. Joy Haas
(of the Daily), George Kcsato, and Dorytha I'ooley.
According to Vilas, anyone else was welcome.—The
Editor.)
