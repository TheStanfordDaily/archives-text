In case you missed it. Chuck
Taylor was interviewed Sunday
on "Stanford Scenes," a weekly
show aired 011 KEEN, the voice of
San Jose. George Velliotes was
the question man while Stanford's
mentor did his hest to supply the
answers. The discussion was cen
tered around the present national
emergency and how it will alVect
farm football.
Athletics in War
President Truman has often
h&cked athletics as necessary be
eause a war-time athletic program
is invaluable in maintaining morale
and creating an atmosphere of re
laxation. 'lhese conditions are nro-

vided for both
Spectators and
participants by;
athletics.
'I ay lor pointed
out that the
University no w
it cognizes th t
fact that drop
ping football!
during the last
war was prob-

:11 jIy a mistake. Stanford will in all
probability carry out a war-time
lootball program even if the emer
gency becomes more severe. How
ever, if the situation develops into
u desperate one, continuance de
pends upon service men going to
Stanford and whether their respec
tive units will allow them to play
I ootball.
Taylor made clear the fact that
football is the most valuable sport
us far as military training goes, not
only physically but also in terms
<>1 leadership, determination, and
f.pirit.
I)rail Won't Hurl
Stanford should not lose foot
ballers to the war effort unless
the emergency becomes much
more critical. This fact is sub
stantiated by Taylor's statistics
thai 90 per cent of the varsity
are enrolled in various campus
ItOTC programs while the others
are in reserve units. There are
some who won't be called because
of their vocational choices, such
as (Sill McColl and Eric South
wood, who are in Med School,
while Leon King is studying
theology.
The discussion switched to Bob
Mathias. Taylor said that he had no
idea what kind of football player he
would be, but expressed the view
that Bob has the physical and com
petitive abilities needed. He added,
''It should be interesting to see how
he adjusts."
The topic of small schools and
football was brought up. St. Mary's
was cited as an example of how
modern football and the platoon
system in particular can force a
small school to the sidelines, be
cause they cannot compete with
bigger schools either in costs or in
manpower. As far as mass substi
tution goes, it looks like the Na
tional Football Rules Committee
will have to alter the regulations
before platoon type football ceases.
Winning Isn't All
Finally the question of his coach
ing philosophy arose. Chuck, talk
ing for himself and his staff, said
that "winning football teams aren't
every thing. The contributions the
staff and the game make to the life
of a boy are every bit as impor
tant.' As he so well put it, "You
run I eat a football after gradua
tion."
