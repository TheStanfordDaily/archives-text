### 
LOS ANGELES, May 28 (UP)
—University of Southern Cali
fornia, shooting for its 11th
straight Pacific Coast Confer
ence track and field champion
ship, qualified every man it sent
out today in preliminaries of the
two-day meet.
Although Southern California ap
peared to have an unbeatable edge,
Stanford qualified nine men in the
six events in which preliminaries
were held. The Indians failed to
have a man qualify first but showed
depth and indicated they would be
favored to finish behind the Trojans
tomorrow night.
The Trojans led the qualifying by
putting 10 men into tomorrow's
final and will be up to the full par
ticipant limit of 18 performers when
the athletes take the track at 8 p.m.
The outstanding performances of
the day also were credited to two
Southern California weightmen —
Larry Goins in the javelin and Par
ry O'Brien in the shot. Goins de
livered his second best competitive
throw by heaving the spear 212 feet
7% inches. O'Brien, despite a lame
back from an auto accident Satur
day night, but the shot 54 feet 9'i;
inches.
In the running events the win
ners, especially in the 220- and 440-
yard heats, loafed their way to the
finish mark, saving themselves for
tomorrow's finals.
Because of scratches just prior to
the qualifying events, heats were
eliminated in the 100-yard dash, the
120-yard high hurdles, and the 220-
yard low hurdles. Officials decided
there were enough lanes to handle
all the athletes entered.
A slim crowd of between 800 and
1,000 persons turned out at the Col
iseum lor the trials, but a crowd of
5,000 or more was anticipated for
tomorrow's finals.
This is the way the Stanford
tracksters fared.
Maury Parsons and Wilbur Tay
lor both qualified in the 100-yard
dash. Darrell Kreitz placed in the
120 high hurdles. The two Bobs,
Bryan and Mathias, qualified fourth
and fifth in the 220 low hurdles.
Mathias, Lew Davis, and Chuck
Hokanson took three of the six
qualifying places in the shot put.
Jeff Mcßae placed in the broad
Jump. Taylor and Parsons also
qualified in the 220. Mathias and
Chuck Renfro remained in the dis
cus throw.


OFF TO THE RACES—Card relay hopes suffered a severe
blow when it was announced that Bill Storum (pictured on the
right) will not make the trip to Los Angeles because of illness.
Storum also runs the 440. Will Taylor, who has already quali
fied in the 220 and 100, will be chief Card sprint mainstay.
Against USC here he did surprisingly well in the 100 and 220,
taking a first and a second.
