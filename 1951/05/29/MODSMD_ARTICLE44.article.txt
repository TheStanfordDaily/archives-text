A STANFORD YANKEE — Dr. Bobby Brown, shown sliding
safely into second base in a recent New York-Cleveland game.
Guardian of the keystone sack is Cleveland's Roberto Avila
(left, hat in air). Stanford graduate Brown, who played in the
Stanford Varsity-Alumni Game held on campus a few weeks
back, faces possible army draft but meanwhile is playing third
base for the American League-leading Yankees.
