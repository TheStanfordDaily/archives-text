# NCAA-Bound Golf Team Faces Bright Prospects
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
It isn't often that one hears of a coach producing an undefeated
team one year, and then expecting a still better one for the follow
; ing season, but that may very well be the outlook of Stanford golf
1 Coach Bud Finger.
This year the golfers maintained a 12-0 record for regular dual-

j meet play, won the Northern Cali- ;
fornia Intercollegiates ut Pasatiempo,
but lost to USC in the PCC Tourna
ment at Los Angeles. On June 24 the
team will travel to Columbus, Ohio,
for the NCAA Championship. Coach
! Finger admits that although Stanford
| will probably not upset defending ;
| champion North Texas State, the j
team has a good chance of finishing
; second.
Next year, however, the prospects
| are better than they have been since
j before the war when Stanford pro
j duced four national champions in five
; years. Only two regulars, Jack \
| Knosher and John Elliott, will be j
j gone from this year's team, along
with Cully Ingram, who won a start
! ing spot late in the season.
Knosher, who played No. 2 j
throughout the season, will be tough
to replace. He won 10 out of his 12
matches and tied the other two. His |
average of 75.1 strokes per round!
i was third best on the team.
Elliott, the regular No. 5 man on
j the team, had a record of seven won,
three lost, and one tied. He aver
: aged 75.9 strokes a round and was
1951 individual runner-up for the
PCC championship.
Ingram, who replaced Keith Beek-
I man as No. 4 man late in the season,
, won all three of his matches and
j averaged 7G strokes a round.
Returning from this year's squad
will be Dick McElyea, No. 1 man for
the last two years, and 1950's indi
vidual PCC champion. Dick, who is I
well-known for his almost-invincible !
i short game and his perfect golf tem- ]
perament, is one of the greatest col
legiate golfers in America today.
Roland Conklin and Art Schroeder,
j a pair of sophs who were Nos. 3 and
6 men, respectively, will also be back
next year. Conklin, who is one of the I
longest hitters on the Coast, reached
the finals of this year's Northern
California Intercollegiates. before j
bowing to San Jose's Ken Venturi.
i Schroeder, with a record of 11-1 and i
an average of 7G.7 strokes per round j
was one of the most consistent golfers j
i on the team.
Keith Beekman, a junior, and No. 4
man for most of the season will also
return. Beekman led the team with a I
74.4-stroke average and won all of
his 10 matches.
Outstanding prospect for next year i
will be Dick Taylor. Taylor, who was
ruled ineligible this year, was one of
the greatest golfers in the Southwest
before the war.


BETTER THAN EVER â€” Number
one golfer Dick McElyea will lead
Cards in their quest for national
fame next month.
