# Ocean, Sea Life, Micro-organisms Are Studied By Scientists, Students at Hopkins Marine Station
## 
### BEV BOCK 
Two modest buildings on an
otherwise-deserted point on the
southern side of Monterey Bay
are the first view one gets of the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stan
ford University, founded almost
60 years ago as a marine bio
logical laboratory.
Outside, these buildings arc small
j and plain—one a gray concrete struc
ture, the other of sandstone with a
red tile roof. Inside, they are the
scenes of much research, experimen
tation, and instruction in marine
biology, plant physiology, microbiol
ogy, and prelated subjects.
The Hopkins Marine Station, be
gun in 1892 by Timothy Hopkins and
others, is a division of the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences at Stan
ford. It is staffed by Stanford faculty
members and offers its facilities for
research and instruction to Stanford
undergraduates and graduates and to
students and scientists throughout
the world.
Blinks Director
First of all, you have to meet the
people there —Dr. Lawrence Blinks,
director; Dr. Rolf Bolin, assistant di
rector; a staff of instructors and resi
! dent investigators; and graduate stu
dents doing research (about 10 at the
present time).
The staff members are all leaders in
their fields. Dr. Blinks specializes in
plant physiology, while Dr. Bolin's
| field is marine biology and oceanog
raphy. Dr. Cornelis van Niel, who
conducts research for three quarters
and teaches in the summer, is known
all over the world for his work on
photosynthesis of algae.
A full picture of the station must
include the boat which 1$ the pride
and joy of everyone there. Acquired
a year ago, it is 41 feet long with a
wooden hull, a small cabin, and a

185-horsepower Gray marine diesel ,
engine.
Takes Sea Samples
The "Tagc" is used, under a U.S. j
naval research contract, to take hy- j
drographic and biological samples j
from the sea each week. A huge net |
with a mesh of 30 to the inch is used {
to gather organisms which range in j
size upward from the almost-too- j
small-to-see classification.
A 1.200-meter steel cable and in
tricate cylinder and thermometer |
equipment is used to take water sam- |
pies and determine the temperature |
of the water at various depths.
The information being obtained j
from the weekly samples is being ap- j
plied particularly to the question of j
spawning success of various marine J
organisms in relation to hydrographic j
conditions. The solution of this prob- j

lem might make it possible, for in
stance, to poison in certain areas such
disagreeable pests as the boring or
ganisms which damage enough wood
to cost the Navy and maritime indus
try over $100,000 yearly.
A I/<>ok Inside
The Alexander Agassiz Laboratory,
the older gray building, is the head
quarters for marine biology and
oceanography. In its laboratories the
material collected on the boat's
forays is classified, charted, and pre
served. Shelves in the smaller labs
are full of jars containing this sea life
and, in addition, charts arc being
made of the weekly catches of cer
tain types.
In these labs arc found preserved
marine life of strange and fascinating
varieties. Fish with luminous organs
forming unusual patterns on their

bodies and shrimp so transparent
they can't be seen against a white
pan are just a few. Some varieties of
living marine life are also kept.
The Jacques Loeb Laboratory,
completed in 1928, is designed for re
search in experimental biology. Here
much work goes on with small or
ganisms, many too little to see with
out a microscope.
Ciivcn Constant Care
These tiny things are given con
stant and careful attention and
eared for like children. Constant
temperature rooms, special agitators,
lights, dark rooms, and other condi
tions must be kept just right to allow
certain organisms to grow.
A large collection of culture tubes
of non-pathogenic organisms is kept
in this laboratory under the support
of the UN. Scientists the world over
can write in to obtain specimens of
almost any such organism in exist
ence from these cultures, which must
be continually cared for and re
grown.


OF FISH AND MEN—Fish are part of the study at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station near Pa
cific Grove, but they're not all of it. Pictured above is the Loeb Laboratory where work is done
in experimental biology, particularly with micro-organisms. The other building at the station
houses work on marine biology.

in experimental biology, particularly with micro-organisms. The other building at the station
houses work on marine biology.
Two modest buildings on an
otherwise-deserted point on the
southern side of Monterey Bay
are the first view one gets of the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stan
ford University, founded almost
60 years ago as a marine bio
logical laboratory.
Outside, these buildings arc small
j and plain—one a gray concrete struc
ture, the other of sandstone with a
red tile roof. Inside, they are the
scenes of much research, experimen
tation, and instruction in marine
biology, plant physiology, microbiol
ogy, and prelated subjects.
The Hopkins Marine Station, be
gun in 1892 by Timothy Hopkins and
others, is a division of the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences at Stan
ford. It is staffed by Stanford faculty
members and offers its facilities for
research and instruction to Stanford
undergraduates and graduates and to
students and scientists throughout
the world.
Blinks Director
First of all, you have to meet the
people there —Dr. Lawrence Blinks,
director; Dr. Rolf Bolin, assistant di
rector; a staff of instructors and resi
! dent investigators; and graduate stu
dents doing research (about 10 at the
present time).
The staff members are all leaders in
their fields. Dr. Blinks specializes in
plant physiology, while Dr. Bolin's
| field is marine biology and oceanog
raphy. Dr. Cornelis van Niel, who
conducts research for three quarters
and teaches in the summer, is known
all over the world for his work on
photosynthesis of algae.
A full picture of the station must
include the boat which 1$ the pride
and joy of everyone there. Acquired
a year ago, it is 41 feet long with a
wooden hull, a small cabin, and a

185-horsepower Gray marine diesel ,
engine.
Takes Sea Samples
The "Tagc" is used, under a U.S. j
naval research contract, to take hy- j
drographic and biological samples j
from the sea each week. A huge net |
with a mesh of 30 to the inch is used {
to gather organisms which range in j
size upward from the almost-too- j
small-to-see classification.
A 1.200-meter steel cable and in
tricate cylinder and thermometer |
equipment is used to take water sam- |
pies and determine the temperature |
of the water at various depths.
The information being obtained j
from the weekly samples is being ap- j
plied particularly to the question of j
spawning success of various marine J
organisms in relation to hydrographic j
conditions. The solution of this prob- j

lem might make it possible, for in
stance, to poison in certain areas such
disagreeable pests as the boring or
ganisms which damage enough wood
to cost the Navy and maritime indus
try over $100,000 yearly.
A I/<>ok Inside
The Alexander Agassiz Laboratory,
the older gray building, is the head
quarters for marine biology and
oceanography. In its laboratories the
material collected on the boat's
forays is classified, charted, and pre
served. Shelves in the smaller labs
are full of jars containing this sea life
and, in addition, charts arc being
made of the weekly catches of cer
tain types.
In these labs arc found preserved
marine life of strange and fascinating
varieties. Fish with luminous organs
forming unusual patterns on their

bodies and shrimp so transparent
they can't be seen against a white
pan are just a few. Some varieties of
living marine life are also kept.
The Jacques Loeb Laboratory,
completed in 1928, is designed for re
search in experimental biology. Here
much work goes on with small or
ganisms, many too little to see with
out a microscope.
Ciivcn Constant Care
These tiny things are given con
stant and careful attention and
eared for like children. Constant
temperature rooms, special agitators,
lights, dark rooms, and other condi
tions must be kept just right to allow
certain organisms to grow.
A large collection of culture tubes
of non-pathogenic organisms is kept
in this laboratory under the support
of the UN. Scientists the world over
can write in to obtain specimens of
almost any such organism in exist
ence from these cultures, which must
be continually cared for and re
grown.

OF FISH AND MEN—Fish are part of the study at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station near Pa
cific Grove, but they're not all of it. Pictured above is the Loeb Laboratory where work is done
in experimental biology, particularly with micro-organisms. The other building at the station
houses work on marine biology.
Two modest buildings on an
otherwise-deserted point on the
southern side of Monterey Bay
are the first view one gets of the
Hopkins Marine Station of Stan
ford University, founded almost
60 years ago as a marine bio
logical laboratory.
Outside, these buildings arc small
j and plain—one a gray concrete struc
ture, the other of sandstone with a
red tile roof. Inside, they are the
scenes of much research, experimen
tation, and instruction in marine
biology, plant physiology, microbiol
ogy, and prelated subjects.
The Hopkins Marine Station, be
gun in 1892 by Timothy Hopkins and
others, is a division of the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences at Stan
ford. It is staffed by Stanford faculty
members and offers its facilities for
research and instruction to Stanford
undergraduates and graduates and to
students and scientists throughout
the world.
Blinks Director
First of all, you have to meet the
people there —Dr. Lawrence Blinks,
director; Dr. Rolf Bolin, assistant di
rector; a staff of instructors and resi
! dent investigators; and graduate stu
dents doing research (about 10 at the
present time).
The staff members are all leaders in
their fields. Dr. Blinks specializes in
plant physiology, while Dr. Bolin's
| field is marine biology and oceanog
raphy. Dr. Cornelis van Niel, who
conducts research for three quarters
and teaches in the summer, is known
all over the world for his work on
photosynthesis of algae.
A full picture of the station must
include the boat which 1$ the pride
and joy of everyone there. Acquired
a year ago, it is 41 feet long with a
wooden hull, a small cabin, and a

185-horsepower Gray marine diesel ,
engine.
Takes Sea Samples
The "Tagc" is used, under a U.S. j
naval research contract, to take hy- j
drographic and biological samples j
from the sea each week. A huge net |
with a mesh of 30 to the inch is used {
to gather organisms which range in j
size upward from the almost-too- j
small-to-see classification.
A 1.200-meter steel cable and in
tricate cylinder and thermometer |
equipment is used to take water sam- |
pies and determine the temperature |
of the water at various depths.
The information being obtained j
from the weekly samples is being ap- j
plied particularly to the question of j
spawning success of various marine J
organisms in relation to hydrographic j
conditions. The solution of this prob- j

lem might make it possible, for in
stance, to poison in certain areas such
disagreeable pests as the boring or
ganisms which damage enough wood
to cost the Navy and maritime indus
try over $100,000 yearly.
A I/<>ok Inside
The Alexander Agassiz Laboratory,
the older gray building, is the head
quarters for marine biology and
oceanography. In its laboratories the
material collected on the boat's
forays is classified, charted, and pre
served. Shelves in the smaller labs
are full of jars containing this sea life
and, in addition, charts arc being
made of the weekly catches of cer
tain types.
In these labs arc found preserved
marine life of strange and fascinating
varieties. Fish with luminous organs
forming unusual patterns on their

bodies and shrimp so transparent
they can't be seen against a white
pan are just a few. Some varieties of
living marine life are also kept.
The Jacques Loeb Laboratory,
completed in 1928, is designed for re
search in experimental biology. Here
much work goes on with small or
ganisms, many too little to see with
out a microscope.
Ciivcn Constant Care
These tiny things are given con
stant and careful attention and
eared for like children. Constant
temperature rooms, special agitators,
lights, dark rooms, and other condi
tions must be kept just right to allow
certain organisms to grow.
A large collection of culture tubes
of non-pathogenic organisms is kept
in this laboratory under the support
of the UN. Scientists the world over
can write in to obtain specimens of
almost any such organism in exist
ence from these cultures, which must
be continually cared for and re
grown.
