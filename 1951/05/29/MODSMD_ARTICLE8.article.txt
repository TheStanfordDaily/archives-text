## 
### 
Next fall, the Stanford Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega will operate
a student book exchange on campus, Bill Sanson, chapter presi
l dent, announced yesterday.
Sanson said A Phi O received the go-ahead signal yesterday on
! the project, which has been under consideration for two quarters,

j from Thomas Spragens, assistant to
i the president of the University.
They will use the southwest, room in
! Temporary Building A, next, to the
| Education Building.
| Previously, A Phi O received ap
proval of the project from Excom,
| Mrs. Helena Bauchou, manager of
! the Stanford Bookstore, and Uni-
I versity Business Manager Alf Bran
| din.
i The purpose of the project, ex
! plained the president of the service
' fraternity, is to allow students to
sell their used books for more, and
j to purchase other used books for
i less money.
Under the tentative plan, hooks
will he sold for two-thirds of the
j price the owner originally paid, as
long as the book is in good condi
( tion.
The book exchange will operate
j the first two days of each quarter to
take in books, and following that,
I it will remain open daily for two
weeks to sell books.
After the initial selling period, the
exchange will be open only once or
twice a week. At the beginning of
i each quarter, the process will he
j repeated.
A 10-eent fee will he charged by
A Phi O to cover the costs of han
dling and of maintaining the ex
change.
Assistance on the project, which
is headed by president Sanson and
Lucien Faust, A Phi O projects vice
president, will be given by Business
Manager Brandin, a chaptr adviser.
The Stanford chapter of the scrv-
I ice fraternity is modeling the ex
j change after a successful book ex
' change now maintained by the San
| Jose State College A Phi O chapter.
More details on the book ex
change will be announced next fall.
