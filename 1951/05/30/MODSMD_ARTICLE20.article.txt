"The camera," Clarence John
1 Laughlin last night explained to the
final Tuesday Evening Series audi
i ence of the spring quarter, "can be,
' in the hands of people who know
i how to use it, an instrument to ex
press a meaning beyond reality."
Laughlin, delivering his address
in Memorial Auditorium at. a rapid
1 pace, demonstrated ten methods of
• photographic art, each accompanied
by slides of his own works.
1 Pure photography, the first meth
' od described, was illustrated by a
picture entitled "The Skin of the
House" which consisted of a plas
tered wall, peeling off in places to
show the rough brick below.
Documentation, social revelation,
satire, and abstraction, as v/ell as
the poetic use of the camera,
' other classifications of tho artistic
• use of photography analyzed in the
talk.
Laufithlin considers the symbolic
■ use of the camera as culmination
of his attempts at piercing through
I reality. This method involves, he
said, fixed settings and posed fig
ures to achieve an imaginative yet
significant revelation of the "mpn
tal age of man."
Stressing the importance to his
own career of his interest in poetry,
literature, and art, Laughlin said hi;;
development has been influenced
by such poets as Auden and Spen
der and the artists Paul Klee and
l Max Ernst.
