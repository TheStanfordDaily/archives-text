# One Final Word
## 
### 
Hoover Tower is a big, beautiful, $600,000
building. It rises higher than any other build
ing within its sight, and it affords one of the
finest over-all views of the campus and Palo
Alto that we know of.
However, the building is also a library,
housing one of the most valuable collections
ot documents and records in the United States
today. It cannot be overlooked that the tower
was built primarily to safeguard those docu
ments; only incidentally as a viewing post.
Ever since the structure was completed in
1948, the Hoover Tower staff has been more
than willing to play host to the hundreds of
visitors who are boosted to its top every week,
Monday through Saturday.
For the "greater good" of public relations
they have borne with a patient shrug what
might easily be termed an unending series of
inconveniences.
Staff members have waited needless minutes
for the elevator—simply because it was being
used to lift visitors up and down; they have
taken time-out during working hours to answer
tourists' questions; and they have had to run
from behind their loan desks more than once
to restrain the overly curious.
Now—after some three years of sporadic
student campaigning—it looks like the tower
may be opened on Sunday afternoons, at a
time when none save five Stanford-spirited
members of Alpha Phi Omega will be around
to chide the tourists and keep them in line.
Will the library's collection still be as safe on
Sundays as it is all week long? As we see it,
that's the question the Administration must an
swer if it is to render a final decision on the
proposal.

To date there have been no documents stolen
from the tower, according to police report.
Frustrated carilloneurs have skipped past the
staff and hidden-out in the structure, and teen
agers have wormed their way through rest
room windows. But all for the pure joy of
getting somewhere they're not supposed to get.
We could understand an overly covetous
collector of rare items breaking in—but after
examining the tower's almost spotless record
of break-ins with intent to do actual harm, we
would tend to discount this danger.
If the kleptomaniacs are serious about
doing damage on Sundays, A-Phi-O is just as
available to stall the action or turn in an alarm
as a secretary or two sitting behind a loan
desk.
In line with this very possibility, Mrs. Inez
Richardson of the tower has stipulated that at
least five A-Phi-O guards be present during
open hours. The stipulation has been met.
Financially, the relatively small expense of
janitorial services, electrical power, and mis
cellaneous costs, will be more than offset by
the public relations value of keeping our tallest
and most imposing structure open to the public.
An average of 100 to 150 visitors ride up
the tower's elevator every Saturday—while
it is known that more people come to campus
on Sundays than on Saturdays.
But these are the points the Administration
must evaluate for itself.
All we'd like to say is "thanks" to Mr. Hoo
ver's staff for such a fine job of public relations
to date.
And add a small hope that some sort of
compromise can be worked out on behalf of
our Sunday visitors. A letter from Excom is
on its way.

the public relations value of keeping our tallest
and most imposing structure open to the public.
An average of 100 to 150 visitors ride up
the tower's elevator every Saturday—while
it is known that more people come to campus
on Sundays than on Saturdays.
But these are the points the Administration
must evaluate for itself.
All we'd like to say is "thanks" to Mr. Hoo
ver's staff for such a fine job of public relations
to date.
And add a small hope that some sort of
compromise can be worked out on behalf of
our Sunday visitors. A letter from Excom is
on its way.
Hoover Tower is a big, beautiful, $600,000
building. It rises higher than any other build
ing within its sight, and it affords one of the
finest over-all views of the campus and Palo
Alto that we know of.
However, the building is also a library,
housing one of the most valuable collections
ot documents and records in the United States
today. It cannot be overlooked that the tower
was built primarily to safeguard those docu
ments; only incidentally as a viewing post.
Ever since the structure was completed in
1948, the Hoover Tower staff has been more
than willing to play host to the hundreds of
visitors who are boosted to its top every week,
Monday through Saturday.
For the "greater good" of public relations
they have borne with a patient shrug what
might easily be termed an unending series of
inconveniences.
Staff members have waited needless minutes
for the elevator—simply because it was being
used to lift visitors up and down; they have
taken time-out during working hours to answer
tourists' questions; and they have had to run
from behind their loan desks more than once
to restrain the overly curious.
Now—after some three years of sporadic
student campaigning—it looks like the tower
may be opened on Sunday afternoons, at a
time when none save five Stanford-spirited
members of Alpha Phi Omega will be around
to chide the tourists and keep them in line.
Will the library's collection still be as safe on
Sundays as it is all week long? As we see it,
that's the question the Administration must an
swer if it is to render a final decision on the
proposal.

To date there have been no documents stolen
from the tower, according to police report.
Frustrated carilloneurs have skipped past the
staff and hidden-out in the structure, and teen
agers have wormed their way through rest
room windows. But all for the pure joy of
getting somewhere they're not supposed to get.
We could understand an overly covetous
collector of rare items breaking in—but after
examining the tower's almost spotless record
of break-ins with intent to do actual harm, we
would tend to discount this danger.
If the kleptomaniacs are serious about
doing damage on Sundays, A-Phi-O is just as
available to stall the action or turn in an alarm
as a secretary or two sitting behind a loan
desk.
In line with this very possibility, Mrs. Inez
Richardson of the tower has stipulated that at
least five A-Phi-O guards be present during
open hours. The stipulation has been met.
Financially, the relatively small expense of
janitorial services, electrical power, and mis
cellaneous costs, will be more than offset by
the public relations value of keeping our tallest
and most imposing structure open to the public.
