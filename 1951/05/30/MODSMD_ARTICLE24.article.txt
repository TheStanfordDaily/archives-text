## A 						French Double Header 
### ROY HEMMING 
The Guild and Park Theaters in Menlo come up with
two double-headers this week — one thoroughly
French and the other completely Marxian.
The Marx entry at the Park is as subversive to
vanity as Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo ever
were. "Horse Feathers" and "Monkey Business" are
both pre-Hays Office comedies in which college foot
ball and shipboard romances, respectively, are given
the maddest Marx treatment. Need more be said?
One of the Guild's French films is also on the mad
.side — Jean Renoir's "Rules of the Game." Many
Frenchmen consider it Renoir's masterpiece, and to
.say that of the man who made "Grand Illusion" and
"Lower Depths" is to say quite a lot.
American audiences, however, may not catch on to
everything at first, since it is a social satire, or more
correctly a "drame gai," about the anarchistic life of
the French "haute-bourgeoisie."
It seems to be little more than a fast-moving light

coinedj up to the end when tragedy strikes and you
realize you've really been watching a "dan.se ma
cabre." Then, as you relit the pieces together, you
see how sharply Renoir has revealed the shallow
seams ill the fibbing life of these people.
The other French film at the Guild—"Love Story" ;
(originally "Douce") —Is the work of the same direc
tor and writers us last year's "Devil in the Flesh."
It is not a great film like their other collaboration,
but it is still several notches above most Hollywood
love stories. The story—about an adolescent girl who
gets hurt in a love affair based on deceit—is not un
usual, but the treatment definitely is.
l>iiector has a sense for detail in
setting and mood, and ability for revealing character
through his camera, and a sensitivity in handling
love seenes that I. for one, find rarely equalled in
the movies today.
The Guild's switch from the British "Trio" to its i
French "duo" has not been at the expense of quality, j
