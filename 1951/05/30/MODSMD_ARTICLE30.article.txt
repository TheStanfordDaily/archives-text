# SRI, Italy To Make Survey On Industry
## 
### HARRY GLAZE 
The International Division of the
Stanford Research Institute has
reached an agreement with the
Italian government this spring to
carry on an extensive industrial
survey and analysis of Italy's me
chanical industries.
Dr. Weldon B. Gibson of the SRI
I recently returned from Home, where
! the advance party has set up offices j
i for administration of the project.
Overseas Busses
In charge of management and ad
ministration of the group are John
Abbink of Abbink and Drum, New
I York overseas consultants, and
Janice G. Goodtnough of SRI.
Egidicj Ortona, chief of the Ital- '
! ian 'technical Mission to the United
j States, has representated his gov
i eminent in negotiating for the
I study, which is expected to last ap.-
j proximately eight months.
The survey, requested through
j the ECA, will attempt tu develop a
program lur the most effective uti
lization of manpower and mechani
cal resources. Results will be sub
l initted to the Italian government to
be- used in their "Program for Ac
tion."
Work Divided
Organized under the supervision
ol Dr. Gibson, the American group
will divide its approach into six
main fields: management and ad
ministration, marketing and selling,
industrial and production engineer
ing, industrial relations, industrial
accounting, and general industrial
experience.
The Italian government has set up
I a special commission, known in
Italy as the CISIM. to reactivate the
I mechanical industries to their pre
war level. This commission will aid
in organizing an equal number of
Italian experts to carry on the work
I after the Americans leave.
On returning from preliminary
discussions recently in Washington,
I D.C.. Dr. J. E. Hobson, director of
SRI, commented:
''The economic predicament of
the mechanical industries in Italy
has been critical since the end of
the war. As a result, more than a
third of the industry is now under
government control—not as a mat
ter of government policy, but as a
I necessity to prevent major work
: stoppages from throwing tens of
! thousands of workmen out of jobs."
Mechanical Phase
He said mechanical work is It
| aly's largest industrial classification.
| Since the war, low productivity,
j high costs, and limited domestic
and foreign markets have compelled
the Italian government to give
financial support to many compa
nies.
About one-third of Italy's me
j chanical enterprises are under gov
ernment subsidy.
"There does not appear to be i
1 any basic reason for the Italian
j mechanical industries as a whole to
j continue in this condition," stated
Dr. Hobson.
"Extensive plants with excellent
tools and equipment, skilled tech
nicians of the highest ability, and a
plentiful supply of experienced
workers are available."
In addition to the Stanford re
searchers working on the project,
there are representatives from Ar
mour Research Foundation of Chi
cago, Southwest Research Institute
1 of San Antonio, and George S. Arm
strong & Co., New York consulting
engineers.

I a special commission, known in
Italy as the CISIM. to reactivate the
I mechanical industries to their pre
war level. This commission will aid
in organizing an equal number of
Italian experts to carry on the work
I after the Americans leave.
On returning from preliminary
discussions recently in Washington,
I D.C.. Dr. J. E. Hobson, director of
SRI, commented:
''The economic predicament of
the mechanical industries in Italy
has been critical since the end of
the war. As a result, more than a
third of the industry is now under
government control—not as a mat
ter of government policy, but as a
I necessity to prevent major work
: stoppages from throwing tens of
! thousands of workmen out of jobs."
Mechanical Phase
He said mechanical work is It
| aly's largest industrial classification.
| Since the war, low productivity,
j high costs, and limited domestic
and foreign markets have compelled
the Italian government to give
financial support to many compa
nies.
About one-third of Italy's me
j chanical enterprises are under gov
ernment subsidy.
"There does not appear to be i
1 any basic reason for the Italian
j mechanical industries as a whole to
j continue in this condition," stated
Dr. Hobson.
"Extensive plants with excellent
tools and equipment, skilled tech
nicians of the highest ability, and a
plentiful supply of experienced
workers are available."
In addition to the Stanford re
searchers working on the project,
there are representatives from Ar
mour Research Foundation of Chi
cago, Southwest Research Institute
1 of San Antonio, and George S. Arm
strong & Co., New York consulting
engineers.
The International Division of the
Stanford Research Institute has
reached an agreement with the
Italian government this spring to
carry on an extensive industrial
survey and analysis of Italy's me
chanical industries.
Dr. Weldon B. Gibson of the SRI
I recently returned from Home, where
! the advance party has set up offices j
i for administration of the project.
Overseas Busses
In charge of management and ad
ministration of the group are John
Abbink of Abbink and Drum, New
I York overseas consultants, and
Janice G. Goodtnough of SRI.
Egidicj Ortona, chief of the Ital- '
! ian 'technical Mission to the United
j States, has representated his gov
i eminent in negotiating for the
I study, which is expected to last ap.-
j proximately eight months.
The survey, requested through
j the ECA, will attempt tu develop a
program lur the most effective uti
lization of manpower and mechani
cal resources. Results will be sub
l initted to the Italian government to
be- used in their "Program for Ac
tion."
Work Divided
Organized under the supervision
ol Dr. Gibson, the American group
will divide its approach into six
main fields: management and ad
ministration, marketing and selling,
industrial and production engineer
ing, industrial relations, industrial
accounting, and general industrial
experience.
