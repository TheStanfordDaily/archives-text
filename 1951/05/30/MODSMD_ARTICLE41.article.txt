### DAVE SANDERS 
Gus Chavalas batted and pitched the Delt softball squad to an 11 to 9 victory over Biz School in
yesterday's semi-final intramural contest.
With the score tied up at 9-all in the bottom of the seventh, Chavalas drove a long liner through
the right centerfield hole, and circled the sacks to sew up the game with his fourth hit in five times
at bat.
Chavalas the pitcher bore down on the Biz batters, giving up only six hits, but Delt errors in the

field contributed to the Biz Boys' I"
total. Both teams were shaky afield I •
although several outstandings stops i
were made.
In the top of the seventh, Biz !
School runners were on second and
third with two away, when Biz first |
baseman John Thompson topped a I
slow roller to the pitcher. Chavalas, | '
not one to limit his talents to pitch- j
ing and hitting, scooped up the ball j
and lobbed it toward first.
The throw hit Thompson on the j
back as he neared first, bounced up
and over his head and into the
waiting glove of the Delt baseman.
The umpire called Thompson out by -
an inch to end the rally.
If the throw had not been de- j"
fleeted so conveniently, Biz School i
would have scored a two-run ad- :
vantage, sincc both runners were
on the way home.
Except for Chavalas' four - base |
blow, Delt hit.? were for the most
part singles spread out over the
seven innings. The Delts protected
an early lead until the third inning,
when Biz School left fielder Jim
Brett drove in three runs on a ,
single and a Delt error. Claude Ro- j
senberg rapped a scratch homer,
aided by another Delt error, and the
Biz Boys had erased a five-run defi
cit.
The game remained deadlocked
until Chavalas came to bat. and Biz
pitcher Rod Sackett served up the j
homfe run ball.
Sackett had control trouble dur- I
in«- the early innings and walked in
three runs, while giving up 12 hits, j
The Dclts will play the winner |
of the Theta Chi-Kappa Sig semi- i
final game for the University cham- j
pionship.
