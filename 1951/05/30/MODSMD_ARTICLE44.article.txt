# Bob Lemon Hurls Perfect Game—Almost; Wins 2 to 1
## 
### 
DETROIT, May 29 (UP)—Bob L.
perfect no-hit, no-run game in 29
a home run off him in the eight
wound up with a sterling one-hit
2 tcj 1.
The no-hitter would have beer

jemon of the Indians had the first
9 years going until Vic Wertz hit
th inning today, but Lemon still
;tter as the Tribe beat the Tigers,
n the second of Lemon's career.
! Going into the fateful eighth it
I looked like Lemon had a perfect
game—one in which no batter gets
on base—all but sewed up as he tied
one Detroit batsman after another in
knots with his tricky breaking curve
and blazing fast ball.
Had Wertz not connected for his
' 380-foot homer Lemon, who threw
a 2 to 0 no-hitter against the Tigers
June 30, 1948, would have become
1 the first pitcher to rack up a per
fect game in the Major Leagues
I since Charley Robertson of the
Chicago White Sox accomplished
the feat on April 30, 1 !)22—likewise
against Detroit.
Wertz, the first batter up in the j
| eighth, took a called strike and then |

leaned into one of Lemon's curves
that didn't quite break enough. It
soared into the right field second deck
j as the crowd of 6,280 fans went wild.
The Cleveland players rushed to
Lemon's side to console him in his
| disappointment.
Cleveland romped to its first run
in the fourth with speedy Larry
Doby scoring on a weak fielder's
choice grounder by Al Rosen. Doby
drew a walk and scampered to third
on big Luke Easter's line single l<>
right Held before tallying 011 Kos- j

Ike Williams after knocking him to the canvas in the 14th round

this the fight was stopped, and Carter was awarded the light
weight championship on a TKO. Williams was weakened by the
effort he made to get under the weight limit.

NEW CHAMP—James Carter stands over lightweight champ
Ike Williams after knocking him to the canvas in the 14th round
of their title bout held in Madison Sguare Garden. Shortly after
this the fight was stopped, and Carter was awarded the light
weight championship on a TKO. Williams was weakened by the
effort he made to get under the weight limit.
