# TOMORROW NIGHT'S PROGRAM
## 'Oresteia' to Feature Greek Odes 
### SHARLENE HOFFMAN 
Ancient Greek odes — sung,
chanted, and danced to a spe
cially written music score—are
some of the most unusual fea
tures of the Oresteia to be pre
sented tomorrow, Friday, and
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday
at 2 p.m. in Memorial Audito
rium.
A total of 15 of these choruses are
being retained in the Stanford Play
ers' version of the Greek tragedy by
Aeschylus. Work on them has co
ordinated the efforts of the Depart
ments of Speech and Drama, Music,
and Women's rhysical Education.
The three plays composing the
trilogy art 1 the Agamemnon, Choc
phoroe, and Eumcnides. Altogether
they tell the story of the curse on
the house of Atreus.
Many murders, ail committed off
stage, will also be performed in tra
ditional Greek style. Wife Clytem
ncstra slays hrr husband Agamem
non and the prophetess Cassandra. In
revenge, Clytemncstra's son, Orestes,
slays his mother and her lover, Ae
gisthus.
The play is brought to a dramatic
conclusion with the trying of Orestes
before the gods, Athena and Apollo,
and the Areopagus situated at the
foot, of the famed Acropolis, location
of the Parthenon.
Composers of the weird music of
the Oresteia arc Leonard Ratner
and George lloulc. Orchestration
is supplied by a small orchestra
made up mainly of woodwinds,
percussion, and harp, with a few
brasses.
The dance of the Furies has Heen
choreographed by Joan Hunt. The
dance represents the power these
goddesses have over man. It is they
who punish those who have killed
their own relatives.
All of the dances are under the
supervision of Miriam Lidster of the
Women's Physical Education Depart
ment.
Concluding the trilogy is a chorus
sung by the 60 persons in the cast.

It proclaims "joy to all" with the
redemption of Orestes and the sav
ing of the Furies from further evil
doings.
The theme of the gods' predestina
tion of man runs throughout the plot.
In fact, Greek drama grew directly
out of religious ceremonies and fes
tivals.
Starring as Clytemnestra is Bea
trice Manley, professional actress
who has returned to Stanford for this
production. As Orestes is Jules Irv
ing, faculty member of San Francisco
State College.
Tickets for the Oresteia arc still
selling at Memorial Auditorium Box
Office for all performances. Evening
presentations arc $1.20, and the ma
tinee $1.50.
