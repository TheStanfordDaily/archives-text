# Farm Gives Aid to Delhi University
## 
### 
One day Stanford may be as well
represented in India as India is on
this campus today.
This is one prophecy the Delhi
| Affiliation Committee is keeping in
mind as it works to build a cultural !
, bridge to the East through the stu- !
dents who come from even the most !
. remote provinces of India to study !
i ; their national capital—New Delhi.
Financial assistance was only !
the springboard for the Stanford-
Delhi affiliation. The first check
was earmarked aid to Delhi last
i quarter.
| Since then, letters have come to j
i Kay Cobrt as head of the affiliation
j committee that show promise of a
I two-way current of ideas and tech- j
. ' nical information benefiting both
| | universities involved.
I Dr. V. K. R. V. Rao, director of
the Delhi School of Economics, ex
. tended his welcome and encourage
ment to Stanford's interest in Delhi :
students. Dr. Rao's school, one of j
the most important in the 30-year
old university, plans to offer serious j
p competition to the London School
of Economics one day.
Exchange of letters, along with
printed and visual documents of j
student life between similar in
terest groups on the two cam-
| puses, is one of the projects al
k ready under way under Chuck
1 Yerkcs' direction. Vircnda Agar
' wala, secretary general of the In
' ternational Student Service, has
' promised his help in contacts.
The university's shortage of
' hooks, buildings, and equipment has J
' been aggravated by the refugees ;
who have flocked to the capital in
the past few years, Elizabeth Po
> than, WSSF secretary, wrote from
' New Delhi recently. The students, (
] she added, "will be deeply touched
112 by your sincere desire to share their
112 burdens and especially the spirit of
world student solidarity which has
. motivated your gift."
The Delhi Affiliation Committee
, came into being last quarter when
\ Stanford students through the lIR
s decided to try the projcct in anoth
er country that had created a la:t
ing friendship with the Free Uni
: vcrsity of Berlin several years back.
r ' Because India is a rising force
I in world politics, and because
I New Delhi is a nia'OT focus of
Indian education and politics, the
University of Delhi was chosen.
The vice-chancellor of the A 1 i —
| garb Muslim University has sug
'• ! gested a similar affiliation with his '
1 school. But. for the time being.
r Stanford's program for this and
s next year will concentrate on build
s ing contacts with the students and
i organiztaions of Delhi.
In the university proper and in
- ' affiliated colleges that extend as
far away as Kashmir, the Indian
student body totals 4,000. Govern
ment grants and other outside air!,
such as Stanford's, are making it
possible to gradually replace former
barracks with buildings, build up
libraries, and take care of the ref
ugees now swamping the university.
The Stanford - Delhi Affiliation
Committee will carry on its work
next year under Pete Hadden. Stti
' dents who would like tn take a more
active part in the project can come
to the lIR for interviews this after
noon.
