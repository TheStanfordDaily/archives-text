The questionnaire included space
for remarks on activities which
should be continued, those which
; should bo improved, and those
which students no longer want.
Cardinals tabulated the question

to indicate.
Fraternities and Women's Row
voiced major objections to the
Sadie Hawkins Dance. Women's
dorms and freshmen like the dance
bill only by a close vote. Com
plaints ranged from the wcighing
in process for admission to the tim

uled close to the Roble dance — an
other girl-ask-boy event.

ceived support, but many changes
were suggested. Of the six "Rack to

ners, Barefoot Day, and Hello Dai
were most seriously questioned.
A large majority favored con
tinuance of the Red Cross Talent
Show as one of the top methods of
pushing a charity drive.

replied. The students feel more
money can lie raised in three at

Many comments indicate that too
many activities are being conducted
on campus. A Village questionnaire
called many activities "adolescent
and of high school level." and said
there is little provision for Village
participation.
The current world crisis seems to
influence reactions also. Students
are watching their budgets and
concentrating on more mature types
of activity, the Cardinals question
