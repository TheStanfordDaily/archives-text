## Reds Apparently Screening Line 
### 
TOKYO. Thursday, May 31 (UP)
—An Eighth Army spokesman said
today the stubborn Red resistance
apparently was intended to screen
efforts to prepare a new Commu
nist defense line, six to 12 miles
inside Red Korea.
Low clouds and driving rain
hampered warplanes, limited artil
lery observation, and stalled recon
naissance.
On the ground, the Reds stalled
Allied patrols, and hurled increas
ing artillery and mortar fire at units
probing toward the big Communist
staging area in central Korea.
The fighting slackened somewhat
on the west central front, but Com
munists in company and platoon
strength kept up constant harassing
attacks on Allied units in the Yon
rhon area.
