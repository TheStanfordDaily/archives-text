# Memorial Day Almost Forgotten
## 
### 
Yesterday was Memorial Day.
To most of us it meant 1 i*tie. To
Willoughby Park Richardson,
ford '17, it meant a great deal.
Dr. Richardson returned to his
alma mater yesterday. He did as
he always docs, stopping by the
tomb of the original Stanford Fam
ily to pay his respects.
Rut something was missing.
There were no freshly-picked,
red and white bouquets lying al the
graves of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford and their son, Leland.
Instead, there were two withered
wreaths. And this was Memorial
Day.
Dr. Richardson hurried for the
nearest phone. He called the Presi
dent's office, and there was prom
ised immediate delivery of fresh
flowers.
"It must've been an oversight,"
commented Mrs. Marguerite Colte,
secretary to President Wallace
Sterling. "I thought it was taken
care of."
Fifteen minutes later the new
wreaths — consisting of red and
white snapdragons — arrived from
the campus nursery.
With them returned Dr. Richard
son's fondest memories of Memorial
Day parades to the burial grounds,
the wreath-laying, and the porora
tions of former President Ray Ly
man Wilbur in honor of the Stan
fords.
If we'd had more time with Dr.
Richardson, he might have asked
us why more students didn't take
time out to remember the family
that made this University pos
sible.
But we're glad he didn't. We
would have been embarrassed.
