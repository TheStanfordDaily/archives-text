# There ARE Jobs for the Grads
## 
### 
About a month ago, we called attention to the
fact that many graduating seniors were failing
to take advantage of the employment oppor
tunities afforded them by the Placement Serv
ice. We attributed that apathy to an attitude of
"Why try to get a job when I'm only going to
get drafted anyway, and besides, who'd want to
hire draftable help?"
At that time we pointed out that the nation
was currently building up the largest labor
force in its history, that employers had to hire
college graduates to keep their businesses
going, and necessarily risking that those men
might be drafted. Furthermore, we stated that
employers are often happy merely to have the
men identify themselves with the firm before
being inducted, so that they will be more likely
to return after their discharge.
— It's a month later now, but the same condi
tions still prevail, and business still needs col
lege men. If anything, the draft situation has
improved, what with the Army reducing its
i monthly quota. But seniors are still shying

away from the Placement Service Office in
Inner Quad.
The Service receives numerous calls from
companies throughout the country seeking col
lege graduates — not just scientists and engi
neers, but students of general education as
well.
Seniors who register now will not only bene
fit from present employer contacts through the
Service, but again in later years whenever they
apply for new employment. If students do not
register while they are here, potential employ
ers who write to the University for information
will receive a very limited recommendation
from the few records that Stanford has in the
Registrar's Office. Only if the student has filed
a brochure of personal information at the Place
ment Service can the University forward an
adequate recommendation.
From any angle, it would seem advanta
geous tor seniors to register at the Placement
Service, whether to get a job now or to make
it easier to secure one in the future. — 8.8.
