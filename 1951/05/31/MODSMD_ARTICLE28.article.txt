# BULL SESSION

### CHUCK GETCHELL 
"If" (with apologies to Kipling)
If you can rise at six to iron your blouses,
Then burn the midnight oil shampooing hair;
If you command a closetful of dresses,
But never have a single thing to wear;
If you can sit in class and grin and smile
Where smiles are due, and chew your gum, and knit
And chat, and take verbatim notes the while,
Then still get B's, but never learn a whit:
If you can be as saccharine as Blum's,
Aiu! cost the current fall guy twice as much
by leading him to spend excessive sums

On Scottish cashmeres. French perfume, and such;
II you have seen the City's latest shows,
And danced to every band with other men,
Yet just to show him you're a sport, God knows,
You'll tag along and do it all again:
II you can drink with Dekes and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Zetes —nor lose the common touch,
II only dateless Saturdays can hurt you,
II all men count with you but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With ninety seconds worth of social whirl,
Yours is the Farm and everything that's in it.
And—which is more—you'll be a Sophomore Girl!
