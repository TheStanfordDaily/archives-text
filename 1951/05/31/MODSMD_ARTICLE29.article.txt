To the Editor:
We are writing to you to express unci share a cnn
ctnt, which we hope you will help transmit to our
fellow students. The message we wish to .send you is
that although we don't know the best immediate way
to act in light of the following facts, we all feel that
everyone must do something.
The facts are about the people of India. These are
the facts:
—famine in Darbhange means Indian mothers are
feeding their babies damp mud.
—famine in Bihar Province means the people are
digging up anthills to recover the grain stored by the
iiJit.S.
—famine in Bombay means that the standard daily
iliet of employed workers, 12 ounces of grain, cannot
Le sustained. Scientists say a man may survive with 15
ounces a day.

—famine in Calcutta means there are no living cats,
birds, or rats.
—famine in India means that we must live with
tlie .survivors. We must live with the survivors and
with our consciences. We will do these things:
