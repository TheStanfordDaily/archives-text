# Explorers Will Visit Santa Barbara Caves
## 
### 
Two Stanford specialists in cave exploration — speleologists
they're called —have been selected to take part in the J. W. Sefton
i Foundation expedition to the sea caves of the Santa Barbara Is
i lands.
Edward Danehy of Millbrae, senior in biology, and Arthur Lange

1 of East Orange, N.J., Stanford grad
-1 uate currently engaged in a Navy
research project at the University
jon wave study and ship stabiliza
j tion, will join the expedition party
J aboard the yacht "Orca" in Santa
; Barbara Saturday. Both are mem
-1 bers of the Stanford Grotto, a
branch of the National Speleological
i Society.
Under the direction of Dr. P. C.
Oit, curator of geology-archeol
ogy at the Santa Barbara Museum
of Natural History, the expedition
will investigate the formation of
; sea caves and the possibility of
marine life in the ocean caverns.
If forms of life are found, they
I may prove to be more primitive
i than sea life outside the caves.
It has been found that cave life
lon land is considerably retarded
irom that found above the surface.
Fish found in caves, for instance,
j are often blind with bone - white
: skin.
Lange will serve as oceanogra
pher for the party, seeking out
the caves alontf the island toasts.
Danehy, an experienced cave ex
plorer, will take charge of spele
ological research.
Accompanying Dr. Orr, Lange,
I and Danehy will be Dr. Donald
Wooton, zoologist at the University
j of California at Santa Barbara, and
several members of his staff.
