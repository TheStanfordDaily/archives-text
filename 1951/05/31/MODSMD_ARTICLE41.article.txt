# Students Need Rides West
## 
### 
Driving to Stanford from New
York City next fall?
Seven holders of ASSU Foreign
Scholarships will be arriving in New
York some time in September. To
help get them started on their Ameri
can careers, the Foreign Scholarship
Committee is issuing a call for all
Stanford students who can be on
hand in New York to welcome them.
If you are driving back to school
and want to take one or more of these
students along with you, your ex
penses will be split. You can also
help the committee by providing or
looking for a place for them to stay
until they leave for Stanford.
Contact Phil Saeta (Toyon 120) or
Dick Weismann (Delta Tau Delta)
right away for more information.
