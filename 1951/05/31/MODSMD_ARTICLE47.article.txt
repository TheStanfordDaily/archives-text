# Theta Chi Wins, 7-2; Meet Delts in Finals
## 
### HARRY MARTIN 
Paced by the flashy fielding and sharp hitting of Shortstop Bob
Ames, the Theta Chis moved into the limelight for the coming
intramural softball championship tilt with the Delts by shutting
off the hopes of the Kappa Sigs with a trying, 7 to 3, victory.
Mike Zinclc went the seven-inning route for Theta Chi, allowing

.six hits, striking out six, though
giving up eight walks. His adver
sary, Sterling Clayton, practically
matched his performance save for
one bad inning when the Kappa
Sig infield literally fell apart.
With two down in the fifth, the
Theta Chi's began the rally which
was eventually to tell the tale. Clay
ton issued passes to Chuck Thomas
and Bob Morris, Bob Ames, a thorn
in the side of the Kappa Sigs all
afternoon, singled, and the infield
booted two easy outs, thus pro
ducing four unearned Theta Chi
tallies.
The score had been knotted at
one-al! in the fivst when the Theta
Chi's combined a hunt-error-hit
by Pete ' Red - Dog" Henderson
and a double by Ames to account
for a well-earned run. In the top
half of the same inning, hurler
/inch, a hit wild, walked the first
three men to face him and then,
after allowing Dick Blair to single
in one run. closed the door by
setting the side down one, two,
three.
Theta Chi added two more tallies
in the sixth when Clayton walked
two and Ames, who incidentally hit
three for three, smashed a single
between short and third and Bob
Morris dropped a Texas - leaguer
into center.
Staging a short-lived rally in the
last half of the seventh, the Kappa
Sigs picked up two more markers.
George Masek and Wes Fry walked,
and Jerry Odens drove them home
with a line single to left which
Henderson misplayed to send home
the last two runs.


IT'S A HITâ€”For Theta Chi's Bob Ames in yesterday's tilt with
Kappa Sigma. Behind the plate for the Kappa Sigs is Wes Fry.
Theta Chi emerged victorious, 7 to 3, and will meet the Delts in
the finals.
