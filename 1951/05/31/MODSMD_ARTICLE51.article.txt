## Four Returning Starters Give Burnett Prospects for Southern Division Title 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford may be on the eve of its best basketball season since
Everett Dean's boys copped the national title in 1942.
Fireball Bob Burnett, the brand new skipper, has a wealth of
returning vets and upcoming frosh to work with. The Cards prob
ably woij't be pre-season favorites, since all the Southern Division

teams will be strong again next j
yeur. The Indians will, however, !
he a definite dark horse contender, i
The Indians, who had a mediocre j
season last year, came fast in the
stretch. They ended the season with
two resounding victories over Cal.
Four of last year's starters re
turn for a final fling. Only Jack
O'Sullivan, the jump shot artist,
and scrappy Sid Ilasler, reserve |
guard, receive their sheepskins.
Ed Tucker, the litlie, darting !
forward, is a cinch to nail one
forward spot. Eddie received
honorable mention All-American j
honors last season and was sec- i
and in scoring in the Southern
Division.
Jim Kamstead, the G-foot-5 pivot- !
man, was selected All-Coast last
year and should be head and shoul- |
ders (figuratively speaking) above !
all the other centers in the league.
Jim Walsh ((j feet 3) also received !
All-Coast honors last season. His I
deadly long shot plus his drive-in I
ability will make "Charley Fong" j
an important cog next year.
Tow-headed Bruce Iversen would
seem to have the inside track on
the other guard position. Bruce ex
cels as a team player and is strong I
un the back boards.
A troop of capable reserves will
lie vying for first-string positions.
All-purpose man Gary Andrews
may be the man to fill Sullivan's
forward slot, besides giving aid to ;
Hammer at center. Bill Steven- j
son, G - foot - 6 center, can't be '
counted out, nor can George Za- j
ninovich, the darling of Delano. !
Accurate Paul Johnson; Fritz
Fenster, the smooth guard; Dan |
Evans, speedy forward; Dan Wil- j
bur, loose-jointed center; and Tom i
DuFour, well - proportioned guard, 1
will also be heard from.
Don Carlson (G feet 4) is the i
freshman most likely to crack the \
first string. He is a demon on the I
backboards. Olie Suzdaleff, flashy
guard, is another '.i4er who may see '
a lot of action.
Dave Epperson, G-foot-G center. :
will be groomed to take over the j
enter slot when Kamstead gradu- I
ates. He has a world of potential
and is deadly on the hook shots.
Forwards Ilal Ellis, Don De-
Long, and Sam Morley are other
members of this year's champion
ship frosh team who will give
neck-high depth to next year's
varsity. Also tab guard Tom
Green.
Freshmen will be able to com- i
pete on the varsity, because of the I
new PCC rule.
