INDIANAPOLIS, Ind„ May 30
(UP) — Heavy - footed Lee Wallard
whipped the fastest field in the his
| tory of the Indianapolis Motor
j Speedway today to capture the 35th
annual 500-mile race classic, run off
I in under four hours for the first
I time.
Wallard was out of the lead only
I briefly once the event l>egan, and
his strategy for the run was su
i preme. Starting from the middle
position of the front row, he held
a scant five-loot margin on Jack
j McGrath at the end of the first and
second laps.
One Pit Stop
Then he fell back to second for
two laps, went back in front for two,
and finally dropped to second after
the seventh lap. But on the 10th
j he was in front again, and he stayed
I there until after 50 laps when he
: made his only pit stop.
It lasted only one minute and 13
seconds. He took on a right front
| tire and a full gas load, but even
: that delay failed to take him out
of the picture. Though rookie Jim
;my Oavies went into first place,
when Wallard came back onto the
i track he was fifth and he never ran
worse.
Green Gives Up
As the cars ahead of him came in
lor fuel or tires, he moved up. The
' oar of Cecil Green, who had quali
fied at the second slowest speed in
j the field, gave up after 80 laps, and
' then Wallard moved back into the
; front position and stayed there.
From then on it was merely a
| matter of who might catch him.
i Nobody could. He set such a pace
that it was trouble enough to stay
with him. Nobody could do that
either. He gradually increased his
| scant four- or five-second lead over
the second-place car to more than
i two laps near the finish.
