# Buck Club Boosters Bolster Farm Sports

### JIM MADISON 
Increased tuition costs and increased manpower requirements
caused by the growth of the two-platoon system bring ever more
sharply into the limelight the important role played in Stanford
athletics by the Buck Club.
Heretofore slightly mysterious, the Buck Club was reorganized

early in June on a more specific
basis, including a set of by-laws.
The club is an organization of
alumni and lriends of Stanford who
contribute cach year to a fund for
tuition scholarships to Stanford
athletes. Each member contributes
a minimum of $12 per year and can
contribute as much as lie wishes.
A, contribution of $100 a year
qualifies a member as a "Big Buck,"
and gilts as high as $2,200 have
been made. The club feels that
with current high costs a member
should donate at least $25 per year.
It is somewhat surprising to note
that .)!) per cent ol the present
members are not alumni, but mere
ly people interested for one reason
or another in Stanford and Stanford
athletics.
What are the benefits to the
University? The fund makes it
possible for the University to dis
tribute tuition scholarships to
needy and worthy athletes. Every
single penny contributed to the
lund is used for these scholar
ships, which aiy given in strict
compliance with the PCC athletic
regulations.
No part of any donation is used
for any expenses other than tui
tion.
Stanford is an expensive school
to attend; such a statement is a
truism. But it emphasizes the point
that any athlete who makes his de
cision to attend the Farm is doing
so at a financial disadvantage to

himself when his expenses here are
compared with those of other
| schools.
It i.s a tribute to Stanford that
as many good athletes as do make
this decision in favor of attending.
It is also a credit to the Buck Club
j that the donations of its members
make it possible to distribute tui
tion scholarships to these men, who
spend long hours—when they might
i be working or studying or playing
j —out on the practice field.
In return for their donatinos,
ju>t what benefits do the Bucks
i receive? First and maybe most
important, anyone wh ocontrih
utes receives the pleasure of
helping a guy through Stanford—
one who might otherwise not
have had Ihe benefit of "life on
the Farm." Secondly, he is help
ing to liuild Stanford athletics.
And for himself each Stanford
Buck receives periodical bulletins
on the Stanford athletic program
i and preferred ticket classification
1 for all Indian football games.
The latter benefit assumes most
importance at Big Game time. Each
year when the mad scramble for Bij>,
J Game tickets ensues, a Buck mem
-1 ber who has contributed $12 or
J more receives preference on pur-
J chasing a pair (2) of tickets, while
i anyone whose donation is $50 or
| more has preference on four of the
; much-sought ducats.
Contributions, since they are
donations to Stanford University,
i albeit for u specific purpose, are
tax deductible. However, accord
| ing to the rules of the organi/.a
-j tion, all prospective Bucks who
wish to share in ticket preference
privileges must have their contri
butions in the hands of the club
j on or before June 110 preceding
j the season.

And for himself each Stanford
Buck receives periodical bulletins
on the Stanford athletic program
i and preferred ticket classification
1 for all Indian football games.
The latter benefit assumes most
importance at Big Game time. Each
year when the mad scramble for Bij>,
J Game tickets ensues, a Buck mem
-1 ber who has contributed $12 or
J more receives preference on pur-
J chasing a pair (2) of tickets, while
i anyone whose donation is $50 or

; much-sought ducats.
Contributions, since they are
donations to Stanford University,
i albeit for u specific purpose, are
tax deductible. However, accord
| ing to the rules of the organi/.a
-j tion, all prospective Bucks who
wish to share in ticket preference
privileges must have their contri
butions in the hands of the club
j on or before June 110 preceding
j the season.
Increased tuition costs and increased manpower requirements
caused by the growth of the two-platoon system bring ever more
sharply into the limelight the important role played in Stanford
athletics by the Buck Club.
Heretofore slightly mysterious, the Buck Club was reorganized

early in June on a more specific
basis, including a set of by-laws.
The club is an organization of
alumni and lriends of Stanford who
contribute cach year to a fund for
tuition scholarships to Stanford
athletes. Each member contributes
a minimum of $12 per year and can
contribute as much as lie wishes.
A, contribution of $100 a year
qualifies a member as a "Big Buck,"
and gilts as high as $2,200 have
been made. The club feels that
with current high costs a member
should donate at least $25 per year.
It is somewhat surprising to note
that .)!) per cent ol the present
members are not alumni, but mere
ly people interested for one reason
or another in Stanford and Stanford
athletics.
What are the benefits to the
University? The fund makes it
possible for the University to dis
tribute tuition scholarships to
needy and worthy athletes. Every
single penny contributed to the
lund is used for these scholar
ships, which aiy given in strict
compliance with the PCC athletic
regulations.
No part of any donation is used
for any expenses other than tui
tion.
Stanford is an expensive school
to attend; such a statement is a
truism. But it emphasizes the point
that any athlete who makes his de
cision to attend the Farm is doing
so at a financial disadvantage to

himself when his expenses here are
compared with those of other
| schools.
It i.s a tribute to Stanford that
as many good athletes as do make
this decision in favor of attending.
It is also a credit to the Buck Club
j that the donations of its members
make it possible to distribute tui
tion scholarships to these men, who
spend long hours—when they might
i be working or studying or playing
j —out on the practice field.
In return for their donatinos,
ju>t what benefits do the Bucks
i receive? First and maybe most
important, anyone wh ocontrih
utes receives the pleasure of
helping a guy through Stanford—
one who might otherwise not
have had Ihe benefit of "life on
