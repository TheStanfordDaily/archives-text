# Teachers Taught to Teach

Stanford's Announcement of
Courses calls it Education 145,
Student Teaching in the Ele
mentary Schools, 16 units. The
Announcement of Courses sel
dom makes mistakes, and this i€
no exception.
What does this mean? It means j
that a student who expects to get a
general elementary credential will
all but become a full-fledged teach
er before being graduated from
Stanford's School of Education.
It means a lot of other things, i
too — things like getting up early
five mornings a week, learning the
responsibilities of handling a grade
school classroom, staying after
school in the afternoon, attending
faculty meetings—learning, in fact,
what every teacher knows or should
know.
How It Works
Here is how Stanford's student
teacher program works:
In the last or next to last quarter
before a candidate for the clemcnt

ary teaching credential graduates,
she (all arc women this quarter)
Ls assigned to become a student
teacher in one of the Bay Area
grade schools.
By this time she has already un
dergone two extensive screenings to
decide whether or not she is fit to
be a teacher.
Assuming she survives these, she
now devotes all her time for one
quarter to student teaching. She
goes to the school of her assignment
and becomes an apprentice to one
of the teachcrs there.
Takes Over Slowly
She begins by learning the basic
problems in handling "methods,
materials, and children," by learn
ing to do the routine things re
quired in a classroom.
Then, gradually, she takes over
more and more from the regular
teacher until, by the end of the
quarter, she is virtually running the
classroom alone.
Discipline is the chief problem
facing student teachers. A student
teacher must be able to teach 19
different subjects, and in addition
to this, keep Johnny from sticking

Janic's pigtails in the ink well.
The student teacher, as an ap- j
prentice, is also faced with the :
problem of working with the regu
lar teacher. Although the School of
Education tries to match person
alities, there are bound to he con- |
flicts.
Benefit Mutual
Usually, however, the regular
teachcrs feel they benefit as much i
from their apprentices as their ap- j
prentices benefit from them.
The student teaching program has
proved highly successful. In the i
past four years, only two student j
teachers have failed. For proof of
this near-perfect record of success,
the School of Education points to
the student teachers themselves.
More men and women have grad
uated with honors from the ele
mentary division than from any
other division.
And, when the quarter of student
teaching is over and the general el
ementary credentials awarded, the
graduate is that much more pre
pared to take over her duties as a j
regular teacher in the California j
grade-school system.
