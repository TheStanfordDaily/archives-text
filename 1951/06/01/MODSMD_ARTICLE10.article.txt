# Opening Night 'Oresteia' Is Tedious, Weak
## 
### CHRIS KEITH 
Aeschylus' trilogy, the "Ores
teia," (rhymes with "you're a
lia(r)"), opened last night at Me
morial Auditorium and will run
through Saturday.
Long (over three hours), bloody
(four murders),' the play proved
rather tedious to the first night audi
ence, and sent a large segment of
them scurrying for their cars at the
end of the second act.
In the first placc, the chorus was
- too large. For the most part it was
nearly impossible to make out what
they were saying. Most of the ac
tors, instead of giving the feeling
of drama or tragedy, were merely
pompous.
And unfortunately, the last of the
three plays, which should have been
the best, serving as a climax, was by
far the weakest. Because of this, the
unity of the whole was destroyed.
There were several very fine things
about the performance, however. The
sets were spectacular for a college
show. Stark, yet giving the impres
sion of solidity, they caught beauti
fully the spirit of the action.
The stage blocking was also ex
cellent. The musical accompaniment,
although now and then too loud, was
interesting.
Perhaps the most enjoyable fea
ture of all was Manley's fine
acting. She gave, by far, the out
standing performance of the eve
ning. Her gestures were effective;
her timing was good.
Don Campbell in hi.s MacArthur
like characterization of Agamemnon,
and Bernard Blumberg as Aegis
thus, were not bad at all.
However. Orestes (Jules Irving),
Cassandra (Eleanor Prosper), Athena
(Ix>is Moran), were more or less un
successful. Margaret McKenna's
portrayal of Electra was particularly
unfortunate.
I^was certainly a difficult play to
put on successfully. There were in
dividually so many aspects that were
excellent, it Ls too bad they were lost
in the tedium of the general effect.
The problem of the chorus, no
doubt an exasperating one, when
handled inefficiently, proved to be
the major undoing of the perform
ance.
In the last act, the Orchcsis girls,
who had hitherto restrained them
selves to some extent, gave way to
excessive posturing, making the ac
tion even more confused, and the
stage even more cluttered. Perhaps
by this time, however, the length of
the play was beginning to tell.
