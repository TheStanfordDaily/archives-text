George Big Fellow, the Lion
Hearted, must go. He is the friend
ly little black and white dog seen
about campus and recently featured
in "Bull Session." Because of a new
University directive and the com
ing summer, we are no longer able
to keep him.
He is gentle and especially fond
of childiTn. He is a good watch
dog and will stay close to the prem
ises. If you want a fine, faithful
dog, phone DA 3-8818 at any time
or call at the Palo Alto Animal
Shelter.- Dick McLean
