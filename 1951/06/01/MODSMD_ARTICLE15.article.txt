## 
### 
Excom voted late Wednesday i
night to overrule a Ram's Head
financial Committee decision to
charge Spring Show Musical Di
rector Bill Barnes an estimated
$260 for the show's musical ar
rangements.
Minutes later, the Executive Com
mittee voted to accept a Ram's Head
Board ruling that Barnes not he j
forced to pay the $260, hut that he
forfeit his $60 salary for directing the ;
show as a penalty for "spending 1
money without authorization."
Testimony offered at the meeting
by Ram's Head Financial Manager
George Denny and Spring Show or- i
chestra member Hal Nachtrieb, indi- :
rated that Barnes, who was unable
to do the arranging himself, had con
tracted with a San Francisco arranger j
to do the job for $960—5685 more than
Ram's Head had budgeted.
Denny admitted partial liability
when he said the financial commit
tee's original estimate of $275 for
arranging "was too low." He said \
$403 should have been set aside.
However, the financial manager
said he didn't know about Barnes'
contract with the San Francisco ar
ranger "until three days before the !
show, when it was too late to do any- !
thing."
Denny said the financial com
mittee was willing to compromise
on the $685 deficit by paying part
of it, but contended Barnes should
come through with $260 for violat- !
ing ASSU financial regulations.
Admitting that Barnes had ex
ceeded his authority, Nachtrieb!
averred nevertheless that Barnes |
"was unable to do the arranging him- i
self at. a lower cost because of time
difficulties."
Nachtrieb stated $060 "was the
lowest, figure obtainable under the '
circumstances." He indicated Ram's!
Head would have had to pay "at least ,
that much" even if it had known he- (
forehand that Barnes was not doing ;
thr arranging.
