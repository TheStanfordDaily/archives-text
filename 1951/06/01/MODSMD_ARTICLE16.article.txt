# Oh For The Life of a Lifeman
## Or How to Get One-Up on Excom 
### ROWLAND REBELE 
Know what a "lifeman" is?
Quite simply, he's a gay blade
v/ho fancies himself expert in
the art of "winning games with
out actually cheating."
At this very moment, running i
,trmjnd campus, there are some I
ix chartered members of thr "Stan
o 'd Lifemanship Association."
Wednesday night the sextet- in thr j
"»er»on of ASSU Business Manager
l);ivr Klliott petitioned Excom for
permission to become a recognized
"aitipus organization.
'I hoy cot it. And Elliott didn't even
have to reveal the names of thr mem
bers, whom hr assures "arc nil reg
istered students of Stanford Univer
sity."
It seems the "lifemen" arc dis
cijilrs of the Fnglish author-philos
opher Stephen Potter, who last
year completed two hooks. "Life
manship" and "Gamesmanship." |
The writings, done up in neal pack
ages of dry British humor, cite
"true to life" examples and cases
of "how (o win games without ac
tually cheating."
The lifeman's motto: "If you're not
one up. you're one down."
Just exactly what the motto means,

nobody seems to know hut the life
men. At any rate, current members
of the organization tell us "it really
works."
As <»ne tow-headed wg-member

told us the other night:
"Take (he swimming team. If
you're in a race against a partieu- j
larl> good man. you pick a time !
seconds before the race to tell him
how good he looks — implying, of
course, how lousy he actually
looked in his last pool appearance.
I hen y< ure a cinch to come
through."
But lifemanship has other outlets.!
On the j'oll links, it. finds true cx
pres -ion.
Your opponent turns out. nattily
drcv.ed and specifies a certain caddy.
Conversely, if you're a Hfeman, you
show up in levis, i hiv from the waist
up. insist an carrying your own bag.
Maybe the opposition feels embar- ,
rassed. Maybe he feels you're fi
pushover. In any case because he's
not sure just what you're up to
you re "one up on him from the
very beginning.
And thrt s oil a lifeiiiHn wants out
«112 li r e: to he one up. Because if
yu re not one lip, you're one down
—and that's all. brother,
I ifcmtn tell us their organisation
"finds inspiration in the yet un- j
translated works of the unpublished
r ?'. rm n mystie transcendental poet
Km ira Maria Rilke."

"Both tratv'.eenclenl and imma
nent" the society tries to "broaden
and lighten the burden ... of the
many and varied problems of every
day campus life."
The organization avowedly holds
<juarterh meetings, collects dues,
and sponsors some sort of dubious
"ceremonial" during spring quar
ter, in which "the public is invited
to participate."
Wednesday night, their constitution
almost didn't make it. Fxenm mem
bers split right down the middle on
the issue, left it up to ASSTJ Pie i
dent Terl Buttner to cast the deciding
vote.
Buttner fell an obvious victim to
"lifemanship" tactics and entered bis
vote in favor of approval of the con
stitution. Now lifemen can us« the
name "Stanford" without fear of re
prisal.
Afterwards, ASSIJ President
elect Wayne Alley is reported to
have asked Business Manager El
liott. himself a lifeman:
"Is this hist to find out if ANY
-1111 N( • can get through Kxcom?"
We didn't catch Elliott's reply.
At any rate, the six Stanford life
men can be justly proud of them
selves. At the moment they're "one
up" on Excom.
