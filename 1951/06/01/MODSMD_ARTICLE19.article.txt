# Grad Request Given the Axe
## 
### 
Excom Wednesday night. defeated
a request for $450 to sponsor an all
graduate picnic and dance next year.
Harry Rnwe, grad Excom member,
had requested the money be appro
priated from next year's contingency
fund in order to give the newly-or
ganized Graduate Student Organiza
tion "something to work with."
Excom also swung the axe on
the weekly "Informer,'" advertising
placard put out by ASSU, afler a
recommendation from Publications
Committee that the sheet "has
ceased to serve the student body."
In previous years, the Informer has
made as much as $400 per year for
ASSU.
Excom decided last night to ap
propriate not more than $200 from
the contingency fund in order to
print an additional 1,000 copies of
the Erosh Bible for new graduate
students next year.
Yesterday's Daily listed the sum
at $2,000.
Business Manager Dave Elliott
suggested that a "new publication to
replacc the Informer" would be con
sidered at subsequent Publications
Committee meetings.
Controversy raged over whether or
not the graduate student body was
"getting a fair share of returns for
its money" during debate on the
Rnwo proposal.
OfT-campus Representative Gil
Jonas, arguing on behalf of the grad
uates, said "I don't believe they (the
graduate students) get one-twentieth
as much out of ASSU as they put
in it."
Final vote defeating the $450 re
quest. was eight to four.
