# The 						Editors' Last Chance
## About Newspapers â€”And The Daily 
### 
I found these words in another "last edito
i aj." written by Editor Stan Beaubaire (now de
ceased). on Feb. 13, 1935. Editor Beaubaire's
reMaiks were directed to his successor. 1
would like to do likewise:
. . you will learn that the Administra
tive doesn't give a tinker's dam about who
thns The Daily as long as it continues publi
cation. . . . You can print anything you want
as long as it is true, clean, pertinent, and
courteous.
. Always distinguish between the indi
vidual and the general welfare. Many will
burst into this shack demanding that you sup
poit this or that cause. Don't let them bother
you. . . .
. . No matter how you support or oppose
anything, remember that your own action
should be based upon the best knowledge at
your command, the facts in entirety, and that
your own ignorance of the other lellow's side
will not excuse you. Always know both sides.
What the ex editoi was trying to do was
hand out a little press philosophy. It means a
lot to those ot us who call ourselves news
papermen. but sometimes 1 think it could
mean much moie to those whose unfamiliar
ity with newspaper ethics is often evident.
Tor instance, it is literally amazing how few
people actually know both sides to any story.
If the newspaper with all its limitations can
only piesent an INTRODUCTION to thought
about both sides, it is successful, whatever
"people who know" may say.
Here at college where newspapering is just
piofessional enough and just ivory-towerish
enough to provide the perfect balance, we can
be just as investigatory as we like. The only
limitation is our own time.
Theie is no excuse for not printing both sides,
no excuse for tailing to give ciedit where credit
is due. censure where it may fall.
In short, it is what we have tried to do this
past volume, but it is also where we have failed
more than once.
If you keep your sense of humor, Gordv.
keep tiying awfully hard, and keep on learn
ing something from everyone you meet, you
won't fail.
Good luck! Rowland Hebele

hand out a little press philosophy. It means a
lot to those ot us who call ourselves news
papermen. but sometimes 1 think it could
mean much moie to those whose unfamiliar
ity with newspaper ethics is often evident.
Tor instance, it is literally amazing how few
people actually know both sides to any story.
If the newspaper with all its limitations can
only piesent an INTRODUCTION to thought
about both sides, it is successful, whatever
"people who know" may say.
Here at college where newspapering is just
piofessional enough and just ivory-towerish
enough to provide the perfect balance, we can
be just as investigatory as we like. The only
limitation is our own time.
Theie is no excuse for not printing both sides,
no excuse for tailing to give ciedit where credit
is due. censure where it may fall.
In short, it is what we have tried to do this
past volume, but it is also where we have failed
more than once.
If you keep your sense of humor, Gordv.
keep tiying awfully hard, and keep on learn
ing something from everyone you meet, you
won't fail.
Good luck! Rowland Hebele
