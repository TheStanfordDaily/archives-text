Hutted roads, lower division advisors, and to
hell with that professor who thinks his course
is the only one you're taking. We have griped
about these things for four years and now we
•are leaving Stanford still dissatisfied.
If we came here for an education, we waste*:
units and hours answering examination qiu
tions with our professor's interpretation of 1..
subject. We took courses we didn't like 1 "•

lorget when it was over. We said we never
studied, and digested a whole course in the
reserve book room the night befoie a final
In a few years only a metal diamond in Inier
Quad, a few records made in the dust of the
Stadium and our dissatisfaction will remain.
But 1 hope that our dissatisfaction has ma

our all night bull sessions, our gripes about
lower division advisors and the foreign L>'i

committee has been working for a year <>:. .
new fabric to replace it.
The whole lower division system including
the advising will probably be changed The
committee, as well as the students, is not ? ati

halfway between a rigid requirement sys'.ern
and a cafeteria where students dazzled by a

Among the proposed changes are ar'nevc
menf fes/s covering more fields of high
school work, and achievement tests over
three areas ol university work Humar.
Biological or Physical Sciences and the• S

Year by year since we have been here Star,

The freshmen of the class of 1957 will never
remember a six-hour reg line or a frustrating
barrier to the library stacks.
