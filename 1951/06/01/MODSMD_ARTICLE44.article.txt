### 
Next year's ad salesmen for The
Stanford Daily wili receive a 10 per
cent commission on all ads sold,
Daily Business Manager Jim Maz
zoni announced last night. At pres
ent, salesmen work for nothing.
The "commission selling" plan,
first of its kind ever started on The
Daily, was okayed by Publications
Board Tuesday afternoon. Excom
later gave final approval to the plan.
Coincident with commission sell
ing will be a 10-cent boost in basic
display advertising rates, Mazzoni
said. At present the rate is 75 cents
per column inch.
The current business manager
said the 10-cent increase was neces
sary to "provide for commission
selling . . . and combat increasing
printing costs . .
Mazzoni said commission selling
would "increase efficiency and mor
ale within the business staff." He
indicated the percentage plan would
draw potential salesmen to The
Daily and give added impetus to
their selling efforts.
Both the Quad and Chaparral al
ready have commission selling.
