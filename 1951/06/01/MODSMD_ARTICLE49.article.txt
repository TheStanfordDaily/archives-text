# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Unlike Brother ifalmieri, I'm not
writing my final Bull Session.
Heavens, I just finished yelling "To
hell with '54" this year. And by
the grace of God and Draft Board
No. 57. I'll be around for two more
years. Usually, only the graduating
senior writes the hearts-and-fiow
ers farewell stuff. And this is as it
should be. But I think a new
"angle" should be explored â€” the

view of the returning undergrad
who is going to miss the Class of '51.
Gosh and gee, the reg lines
won't seem the same without the
old faces. It seems to me the
saddest ones after graduation
aren't those who get the sheep
skins. It's those of us who have
to adjust to their not being here.
To steal a Winchell gimmick, "or
chids" should go to several rnern

bers of the graduating class who
made an indelible imprint at Stan
ford: Special commendation goes
to the editors of Volumes 118 and

! 119, Gordon Ad
dison and Row
land R eh e Ie .
Gordy and Reb
displayed unu
sual maturity in
their editorials
and in setting
down Daily pol
icy.
Te d Buttner,
J the people's

choice, and Dave Elliott, hard
working student manager, deserve
a round of applause. Special plau
dits should go to Jo Lyon, the fire
ball veep. Old hands can't recall a
more dynamic worker than cute Jo.
She's a giant.
Then there are Chuck Gclchell,
Vic Palmieri, Ted Hinshaw, Gor
dy Campbell, Bill Bctlike, Jan
Edwards, Jane Troxell, Tom
Shaw, Jim Scotl, Dwighl Wilbur,
Reddog Henderson, Phil Neilsen,
Derek Bok, Jane Alabaster, llicks
Williams, Tim Midland, John
lYlolheral, Pete Slusser, and so
many, many more.
. . '51, we'll miss you
