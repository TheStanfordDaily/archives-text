# 42 Seniors Are Sheepskin-Bound; Football, Track, Lose Key Men
## 
### BOB SPIELMANN 
Here today and gone tomorrow!
That'll be the story June 17 as 42 seniors hang up their athletic
togs and say good-bye to the Farm.
The football squad is hardest hit, 13 lettermen having played
their last game for the Cards. Leading the list are:

Co-captains Russ Pomeroy and
Gordy While. Pomeroy, under
rated and probably the best line
backer in the nation, outplayed Les
Richter in the Big Game last year
to climax a brilliant career, even
though Richter subsequently made
Ail-American. White, hampered by
a serious spinal injury, did not
round into lorm until late in the
season but then showed his mettle
against Army and Cal. On the of
fensive side of tackle,
Wes Poulson, whose downfield
blocking was just about the best on
the team all year, and Ted Taylor
will be lost. The fifth tackle who
will not return is
Dick Gaedtke, who had a hard
luck season, being injured severa
l'time§. Although the guard slot is
left intact, graduation takes three
ends:
Bruce Van Alstyne, Doti Enberg,
and Boh Scott. Van Alstyne was a
vital factor in the Indian passing
attack, taking much of the pressure
off Bill Mc'Coll, although he was
overshadowed by his All-American
running mate.
Goodbye Bowl
When Van Alstyne was injured in

midseason it dealt a serious blow to
the Cards' Rose Bowl hopes, and
the team did not regain its form till
he returned to action in the Big
Game. Scott was hampered by in
juries, while Enberg was used as a
"spot" player, as was
Tom Shaw, who starred in his
role as "relief quarterback." Shaw,
receiver of both the Gimbel and
"Pop" Warner awards for his fine
team spirit, came through in the

USC game to pilot Stanlord to a tie,
though his outstanding relief play
in the UCLA game was too late to
salvage Indian hopes.
On the baseball side his third
base play was one of the finest in
the CIBA, and he was one of the
best clutch hitters on the team.

Shaw's loss, together with that of
halfbacks
Boyd Benson, Bob White, and
Dick Broome, hits hard at Chuck
Taylor's '51 backfield plans. Ben
son, outstanding on quick openers,
Scored the Cards' tying touchdown
against Cal on a pass from Kerko
rian. White, who led the 1949 up
set rout of the Trojans, went over
with the "winning" tally in the '50
Big Game, only to have it called
back. Last but not least of the de
parting footballers is
Dick Abraham, sterling center,
who perhaps played the steadiest
game of any player on the team
all year.
Track Also Hit Hard
Second most serious losses occur
on Coach Jack Weiershauser's track
team, which has been injury-rid
dled all season. Dealing the most
serious blow to any hopes of a PCC
track title was the injury to the
leg of
Merritt Van Sant, whose 24-ft. 3-
in. broad jump was the fourth best
in the country. Other players with
national ratings graduating are
Lew Davis, who placed fourth in
the NCAA's for two years, and
Darrell Kreitz, who is expected to
be among the first three in the
nationals. Also lost from the team
are sprinter
Konnie Buck, Ed Triplet! (jave
lin), Cass Bly from the relay team,
and Logan Scroggy, Van Ileusen,
Pete Young, and Jack Burke.
Seven men (including Tom
Shaw) will be gone from the base
ball team come next year's CIBA
campaign. Hard to replace will be
Bruce Cameron, co-captain, and
shortstop on the double play com
bination that led the CIBA in twin
killings this spring. In addition,
Cameron has the distinction of be
ing the only player ever to hit two

home runs out of the Sunken Dia
mond. The combination of Cameron
to Abramson to
Jim Castagnoli is being further
broken up by the departure of the
latter. Castagnoli was the "holler
guy" of the team and together with
Dick Clegg provided the spark
plug for the Cards. Clegg led the
league with 12 stolen bases, and in
addition was number two on the
team in the KBI department. ()\
the pitcher's mound
Jiiu C la\po:il was the outstanding
relief pitcher, and Jack Alexander
also did a good job. Claypool's best
performance was in the third Cal
game when he beat Bill Nishita in
relief. A lot of credit lor Claypool's
fine performance must he given I.
Hill llcrron, who did an excellent
job in handling the pitchers, in

addition to being the Indians' num
ber one catcher on the 1950 CIBA
championship team.
In contrast to the other sports, the
basketball team loses only two men:
Captain Jack O'Sitllivan and for
ward Sid Hash 1 /. O'Sullivan, using
his jump shot to perfection, led tlx
Cards to their only victory over
USC this year, scoring 24 points, as
well as hitting the basket for 20
against Baylor in the Cow Palace,
barely missing making the mythical
"21 club."
Coach lorn Haynie will miss five
paddlers from his championship
team when lie calls the roll next
year. Gone will be
Ernie Poke, captain and one of
the top point-getters, who placed
fourth in the 440 and fifth in both
the 220 and 3,500 in the PCC meet.
No less of a loss are

Charles Kelly, Boh Grisemer,
Pierre Hathaway, and Art Brown.
Kelly placed fourth iu the 50 in the
PCC meet, swimming the distance
in liie time of 23.9. Grisemer, who
did not compete until this year, won
the event in 23..'5, fastest time re
corded in the conference this sea
son.
Tennis loses tho services of Vince
Sohniicder in the sixth singles and
Phil Nielsen in the second doubles.
The boxing ranks are decimated by
the departure of Bob Baker, three
year letterman, together with John
Colton an-) Dave Oberlin.
From water polo, Hub Stokely
and Don Weeden give up the privi
lege to get drowned next year. • The
gymnasts will have to do without
the cavorting l ; of Dud Kenworthy
and Jim Harris. And if we've for
gotten anybody, please forgive u/»
