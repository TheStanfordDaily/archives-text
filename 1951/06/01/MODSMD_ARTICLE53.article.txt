I I
I fan see it now. . . .
I can see my grandchildren by the tens and twenties through the sagging
doorway of my pension-financed hovel, tugging excitedly at my coattails,
pleading anxiously lor a story about the good old days. 1 hen. alter 1 have
promised to impart to them some precious bit of my priceless knowledge of
the past, I can see them squatting in a semi-circle about my rocking chair,
legs crossed and eyes wide with the tense curiosity of youth. I can heai
th« *ir eager questions:
"Do old sports editors die or just fade away.'
"Did YOU ever get a letter from Marvin Adams?"
"How do you KEALLY pronounce 'CJrothe'?"
And as I answer these and many more with the calm patience of the very
old. my mind will drift back to the events ol 1950-51.
Buck to the first summer days before the opening of football season,
when the spoils "experts" were tabbing Stanford as one of the live top
powerhouses of the nation. When one writer even ranked the -Kerf
Machine in third place.
The students were crisply confident of their team in September. This was
to be the year for Stanford. Plans were even underway for those New Year's
parties in Pasadena.
Yea, football was king and Stanford was to administer the court.
Then I'll recall:
The Bowl hopes fading even while the name of Bill MeColl was becom
ing a household word acoss the country. . . . The intense frustration ol
the student body, the public scorn heaped upon Coach Schwartz. . . . The
man Schwartz, his idealism crushed by the display of almost frantic antago
nism, deciding to give up the "sport" he had hoped to devote his life to —
quitting even though he had been offered a new long-term contract by
University officials. . . . The dramatic moment he chose to announce his
retirement: after having just mentored an underdog West team to clear
cut victory in the Shriners' annual charity contest at Kezar. . . .
And before that, the unbelievable Army and Cul games. . . . How that
miserable Saturday in the rain turned even gloomier when coach's son
Hob Blaik tossed one to Dan Foldberg in the end zone. . . . How we
reached the other end of the emotional ladder one week later when
Gary lobbed a short one to lJoyd Benson to make hash of Cal's perfect
record.
I'll remember the basketball season. . . . The contrast it offered to the
high-tension atmosphere that surrounded the autumn sport: the enjoyment
and pure entertainment provided in victory and in defeat by a team that
lost half its games. . . . Ed Tucker, Stanford's first Negro athlete, stupe
fying the opposition with his uncanny one-handed push shot.
Tucker again, this time receiving standing ovations one after the other
from appreciative Pavilion crowds—and even from the Cal rooters in the
season finale at Berkeley. . . . Jim Kamstead's easy efficiency that made
the prediction of greatness in his senior year an inevitable one. . . . George
Yafdley's All-American performance in leading the Stewart Chevvies to
the National AAU title, George thereby receiving his passport into basket
ball's Hall of Fame. . . .
And while the cage game was still being played, football crowded into
the spotlight again when Chuck Taylor accepted the head coaching job
and brought to the Farm its youngest coaching«staff in history. It's most
personable, too, what with guys like Chuck, Joe Kuetz. Dutch Fehring,
I Vie Kmetovic, George Lynn, Bob Ghilotti, and Mai Elward. . . .
I'll remember that I saw Olympic champ Bob Mathias in his first year of
official collegiate competition . ... and recall the fuss that attended his
every action: his application to Annapolis before he decided to see it through
at the Farm, his decision to play football in 1951, the mysterious back injury
that prevented his being even a bigger track star. . . .
I'll remember Everett Deans' retirement from basketball, and the fine
record he left behind in the cage game as a coach and as a man. . . . The
appointment of fiery, likeable Bobby Burnett to replace Dean. . . .
Stanford winning teams of the year: Tom Haynie's undefeated PCC title
winning swimmers and Bud Finger's golfers, undefeated in match play but
upset by USC in the PCC playoffs. . . . All the minor sports that contributed
so much but rarely got the headlines. . . . The further valiant efforts of the
orphan crew—officially not a sport at all, but getting plenty of headlines.
Take over, Earl.
