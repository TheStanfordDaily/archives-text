# Simon To Lead Card Trackmen
## 
### DWIGHT WILBUR 
Led by Stanford's sophomore sensation. Bob Simon, the Indian
track team will enter a host of big post-season track meets starting
with the annual Pacific Association meet at Berkeley tomorrow.
Simon, who ran an unofficial 9:16.6 two-mile in the PCC meet
Tuesday, will take on all comers in the P. A. eight-lapper tomorrow.

A dozen or so other Curd trackmen
will also compete against Northern
California's best cinder stars.
In his record-breaking run Tues
day night, Simon took better (ban ;
20 seconds off his previous best !
time of (lie season. The all-time
Stanford record of 9:25.:! was made '
in 19.18 bv Ed Burrows.
Before the season is over, Simon j
will try to break the school's G-litp i
record of G:48.4, held by Indians j
Mushy Girard and Paul Moore.
Five Stanford cindermen will rep- j
resent the Pacific Coast in the PCC-
Big Ten meet to be held at Eugene, '
Ore., on June 19.
They are Maury Parsons, in the 100 |
and the sprint relay; Darrell Kreit/., !
in the high hurdles and shuttle re
lay; Chuck Hokanson in the shot;
Bob Mathias in the discus; and Simon
j in the two-mile.
llokansou got oil' the best put of
his life when he threw the shot
52 ft. l :l 4 in. in the PCC meet Tues
day. The timely throw vaulted him
i from sixth to second place in the
meet and won him a spot on the
PCC team.
Kreitz, who has been running bet
ter every week, finished a strong '
j third in the conference meet, which
was also good enough to qualify.
Mathias won the discus in a clra- !
matic style by beating Idaho's ace
Duane Taylor by one-quarter of an
inch on his last throw. His distance
j was IGO ft. 4'ii in.
The West Coast has a virtual mo
j nopoly on all of the big meets to be
held this year with the NCAA at
Seattle on June 1G and the AAU meet
| at Berkeley on June 23.
As it stands now, 11 men will rep
resent Stanford in the NCAA meet,
with an outside chance of nabbing
i second place behind the perennial
champ, USC.
They include Maury Parsons, Dar
rell Kreit/., Bob Simon, Chuck Ho
kanson, Lew Davis, Bob Mathias.
Bob Bryan. Merritt Van Sant. Norm j
Jiles, Wilbur Taylor, and Chuck Ren
fro.
The Indians' chief competitor
will be Scion llall with their all
around cinder ace Andy Slanfield
trying for a quadruple win.
Four first places in the 100, 220, low
hurdles, and broad jump would net

little Seton Hall 40 big points, usu
ally enough to grab second-place
laurels. Stanford grabbed the second
spot last year with only 29.
Coach Ducky Drake's surprising
UCLA Bruins will also be a lop con- ,
tender in the NCAA. George Brown |
has a good chance of beating out |
Stanfield for first place in the broad |
jump, and Hugh Mitchell's 1:51.6
half-mile places him among the na- ■
tion's best.

rell Kreit/., Bob Simon, Chuck Ho
kanson, Lew Davis, Bob Mathias.

little Seton Hall 40 big points, usu
ally enough to grab second-place
laurels. Stanford grabbed the second
spot last year with only 29.
Coach Ducky Drake's surprising
UCLA Bruins will also be a lop con- ,
tender in the NCAA. George Brown |

tion's best.
