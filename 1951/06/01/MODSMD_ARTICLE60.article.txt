# Theta Chi, Delts Vie
## 
### 
Pitching should be the telling fac- j
j tor Monday when the Delt softball
' ers, led by Gus Chavalas, meet
Mike Zinck's Theta Chi club in a
game to determine the 1951 winner
of the Intramural Softball Cham
pionship.
Both teams will carry undefeated
records into the contest. The Delts
, qualified Tuesday in the semi-final
round by outslugging the Biz
School 11 to 9. Meanwhile Theta
| Chi moved into contention Wednes
| day with a 7 to 3 win over Kappa
I Sig.
Unless the batters suddenly de
cide to take matters into their own
hands, the gams shapes up as a
pitching duel between Zinck and
Chavalas. The latter has amassed
an impressive number of strikeouts
during the past season. Both his

pitching and batting have made him
the star of the Delt team.
Zinck, too. has a number of fine
pitching performances to his credit,
including a six-hit victory over the
Kappa Sigs in the semi-final battle.
Zinck hits been ably backed by a
stellar infield led by Bob Ames and
Bob Morris.
Ames has consistently sparkled at
short-stop, while his batting has
won several games for his Theta
Chi teammates. Morris, Theta Chi
catcher, boasts valuable experience
with the Palo Alto Oaks.
The game is scheduled to begin
at 4:15 p.m. on Field 1.
