# Education Program Teaches TV World Quality Afternoon Broadcast Pays Off
## 
### 
By RAY CHAPMAN
Education is invading the telo- j
vision market and raising eye
brows right and left in the TV
world.
The eyebrow raising is due to the j
explosion of two adages of the young j
TV industry; educational shows d<>,
not draw top audiences, and early
afternoon broadcasts draw little re- j
spon.se.
Stanford, the University of Califor- ]
nia, and San Francisco and Alameda j
County schools are currently pre- j
sen ting a TV series entitled "'Opera- ]
tion Education.'
Each is responsible for one show a '
week in the series. Stanford broad
casts on Tuesdays, Cal on Mondays.'
and S.F. and Alameda schools on Fri- i
davs. All shows are broadcast over |
KRON-TV at 1:30 p.m.
All time San Francisco TV sta
tiens breadcast at but between
15 and 7T> per cent of the sets turned
on tune in to 'Operation Educa
tion." according to various city rat- J
ing services.
This high audience, phenomenal for
an afternoon educational show, is at- j
tributable to several factors. FirsJ
I he produce! s claim the public is in- j
terestod in good TV shows, even in [
the afternoon.
The practice for TV stations has ;
been to book poor shows in the early ■
afternoon on the theory that few i
people listen.
Second, the show is well publicized, j
and third, the people who make up i
the ) rogiam know their business.
The Stanford slmw* are realistic,
practical demonstrations of what
(ducaticn has done, is doing and
can accomplish in the future in re
lation tti the individual and the
world.
For example, next Tuesday's show !
will tell how women's physical edu- I
cation contributes to a woman's edu- !
cation.
The following Tuesday, June 12,
Stanford will tell the story of the j
"Uncommon Man.''
The story concerns the late Pro- I
fersor William W. Hansen, physics
professor, and will show what one
educated man contributed to the Bat- j
tie of Britain, the development of ra
dar, and the development of an atom
smasher.
To put across the point of the pro- j
grains, what education contributes to '
the world, students and professors
who *tage the shows use maps, illus
trations, question and answer sheets,
other visual aids, and even a little
play acting.
Graduate students produce the j
program, and together with the fac
ulty, have made a tremendous contri- !
bution to the success of "Operation
Education."
But the one man who is most re
sponsible for the show's success

is Professor Stanley T. Donner, as- j
: sistant professor of Speech and
Drama.
His radio and TV know-how has
J spelled the difference between a nic- j
diocrc and a top-notch program. Be- I
sides a teaching load of 15 hours a i
j week, Professor Donner spends an- j
I other 20 hours working with the pro
| duccr of each show.
Add that to weekly trips to San
Francisco and you have a busy pro
| fessor.
, The series started as an experiment i
| but may well turn into a permanent '
show, for KRON-TV wants more
! next fall, but Stanford hasn't an- i

I swered yes or no.
After seeing one of the shows, an
enthralled televiewer wrote "There
must he thousands o." vis w.'io tnirst
for knowledge . . . such as your
J staff "an give us."
| Another fan, who has a son and
, daughter in col lege, said "this pro
| pram makes mo feel like a student,
| too."
Other responses have been as fa- |
j vorable, one listener claiming "I'd
, go out »112 my way to buy a product !
j of someone who would sponsor it." {
The chief complaint about the pro- 1
! gram concerns the KRON-TV pro
duction staff. Listeners claim spot
; lighting the visual aids is weak and
the camera frequently lags behind
the discussion.
1 Professor Donner agrees the pro
grams can be improved, but even
with its iaults, "Operation Educa
tion" is proving people go for high
quality TV entertainment, regardless
| of the time.
