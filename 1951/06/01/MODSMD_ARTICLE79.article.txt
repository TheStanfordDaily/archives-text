# Abandoned Items Will Be Removed
## 
### 
Old cars, bicycles, and any other
property abandoned on University
Grounds over the summer will be
removed at the owner's expense,
warned Police Chief Gordon Davis
yesterday.
The University cannot be respon
sible for student belongings of this
nature left on the campus during
the summer. To avoid the necessity
of having their property removed
from University ground*, students
should complete storage arrange
ments before they leave.
