# Good Luck '51
## 
### 
To the Class of '51:
We find ourselves at the end of a busy and enjoyable senior year.
Thanks are due the many people who have contributed to the success of
our undertakings. I take this chance to express our particular apprecia
tion to the chairmen and members of the senior class committees. To
them, some of the hours spent in our behalf must have seemed tedious
and thankless. But out of their work have come the achievements of the
year, and we are grateful for their generosity.
Financially, we anticipate a surplus which will enable us to make a
substantial gift to the University. Our executive committee has voted
that this gift be in the form of a trust fund to be used for he furnishing
of a sudent conference room in the new Tresidder Memorial Union.
Commencement will not mark the end of our ties with the University.
She must depend on us for continuing interest and support as graduate
members of the Stanford Family. I am hoping that a record number of
our classmates will become life members of the Alumni Association. We
can help in yet another way. In the past few years the generosity of
alumni and other friends of Stanford is all that has stood between the
University and the red ink.
Last year 7800 alumni joined together in a giving program which
brought the University over a quarter of a million dollars. They did this
through the Stanford Fund, which was originated by alumni and is con
ducted jointly by alumni and the University. After our graduation, we
will receive annual letters from the Fund, telling us what progress the
University is making and our gifts can help those who follow us as
students.
Recent classes have done well by Stanford and by us in the Stanford
Fund Annual Appeal. Last year the Class of '48 stood first in number of
gifts; the year before it was second.
If each of us will pledge to himself that he will help Stanford in what
ever way he can, whenever he can—whether it be through gifts of money
or in time spent tellir.g the Stanford story to others—he will be helping
others to have what we have and will value forever: a Stanford edu
cation.
Thank you, and the best of luck.
Sincerely,
CHUCK GETCHELL
Class President '51
