# WELCOME TO THE FARM
## 
### 
Nothing is certain but death, taxes, and summer sessions, and
here we are starting off another summer quarter. This summer the
Daily departs from the policy of the traditional first day editorial
by making no rash promises to cover the campus or to strike a
happy medium between campus news and world events. To break
further away from tradition, we will ask for no suggestions, invite
no criticism, and request no letters to the editor. The best we can
promise is that we'll give the best that's in us. Beyond that, it's up
to you, for The Daily is your newspaper.
What we would like to do is extend our wish that your summer
at Stanford holds all the success, pleasure, and fulfillment you an
ticipated. The Daily sincerely welcomes you to the Farm and . . .
can't we let it go at that?
