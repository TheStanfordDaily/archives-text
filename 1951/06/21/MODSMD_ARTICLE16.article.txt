## OUTSIDE STANFORD 
### PETE GROTHE 
JUNE 19 —Two adventuresome young men climbed into a '41
Ford coupe today and started a six-week trip that will take them
across the United States and part of Canada. This I mention be
cause I am one of these adventuresome young men. The other one
being a hometown sidekick of mine, Win Griffith, who, incident-

ally, is student body president at San Mateo
Junior College.
This also I mention because the summer Daily
will be the vehicle for my Rand-McNally com
muniques. I am writing the sequel to John Gun
ther's Inside USA called Outside Stanford.
I'll try to make the series on "Outside Stan
ford" more than just a glorified geography lec
ture. You can look in your atlas for the topo-

graphical details. "Outside Stanford" will concern itself with the
way a neophyte traveler sees the U.S. It will be light with just
enough of the serious to make it readable. It will differ from Stan
ton Delaplane's "Postcards" column, because the Chronicle pays
for Delaplane's luxurious wanderings, and the Daily won't even
pay for the postage stamps I send the columns home with.
You notice I have been avoiding the word "tourist." It's a dis
agreeable word, not in keeping with our manner of traveling. Our
main objective on this trip is to keep away from places where
tourists are so thick that they keep getting in each other's snap
shots.
So crank up the motor, Jeeves, tighten your safety belts, and
hang on real tight around the corners, we're off in a cloud of pave
ment for our first stop, Las Vegas.
