# Colorful Ceremony Marks Farm's Sixtieth Annual Commencement
## 
### DAVID WONG 
A warm sun and a clear sky
greeeted the 8,000 friends and
relatives of 2,875 graduating stu
dents last Sunday afternoon as
they foregathered at the Lau
rence Frost Amphitheater for
Stanford's sixtieth annual com
mencement exercise.
The crowds started to arrive at 4
p.m., and by the time the exercises
began at 5, the tree-lined bowl was
filled to overflowing with eager spec
tators. The ceremonies began as the
graduating students filed in from
both side of the outdoor theater to
the swelling music of the organ.
The plain, black-robed figures of
the candidates for the bachelor's de
gree led the procession. Behind them

came the more colorfully-garbed
candidates for advanced degrees, and !
finally, the faculty members.
Necks craned as the procession pa- 5
railed by. Proud parents sought a
glimpse of their children, while j
friends searched the passing faces for
a Bill or a Joan. Now and then there
would be a cry of recognition, fol
lowed by an exchange of greetings |
and the soft clicks and gentle whirs of
cameras.
The piping chords of the organ
ceased after the candidates had been |
seated. Eugene Meyers, the com
mencement orator, began his speech.
The voice of the chairman of the |
board of directors of the Washington j
Post came clearly over the loud
speakers. He traced the economic
development of the nation during his
lifetime and said:
'"The underdeveloped areas of the i

world, which is to say a majority of
the human race, are not willing to
linger patiently in poverty. They are
looking for an opportunity for prog
ress. They have a choice, even though
it is an illusory one, of associating
with Communist tyranny if no other
choice is offered.
"We have an opportunity, a difficult
one but nevertheless an opportunity,
of offering them a workable chance
to choose the path of freedom. By
hard work, by creative thinking, by
perseverance in the task, you can
create for them that opportunity.
"Or by default, as my generation
defaulted on the problems that
created World War 11, you can give
to the world the most ghastly holo
caust in the history of man."
As he spoke, all else was quiet. He
called for faith, courage, and strength
to oppose the anti-intellectualism of

; all terrorists. He concluded: "Your
generation may well determine the
course of history for centuries in the
awful choice that faces you.
"My generation can offer as our
i most substantial contribution the
| value of our experiences, including
our mistakes—and our faith, as I said
at the outset, in the as yet unfath
omed power of free men wholeheart
j edly committed to the preservation
s of their freedom."
The degrees were then conferred
by President Wallace Sterling. As
each student passed he was handed
| his diploma, the result of his years of
i study and the testament that he was
now ready to try his hand at the
School of Life.
After the ceremonies were over,
j there were the usual congratulatory
i remarks and fond embraces of rela
tives. Slowly the crowds began to

disperse. And as the lengthening
shadows crept across the amphithea
ter, only the empty seats and the lit
ter of discarded programs remained

"Or by default, as my generation
defaulted on the problems that
created World War 11, you can give
to the world the most ghastly holo
caust in the history of man."
As he spoke, all else was quiet. He
called for faith, courage, and strength
to oppose the anti-intellectualism of

; all terrorists. He concluded: "Your
generation may well determine the
course of history for centuries in the
awful choice that faces you.
"My generation can offer as our

our mistakes—and our faith, as I said
at the outset, in the as yet unfath
omed power of free men wholeheart

The degrees were then conferred
by President Wallace Sterling. As
each student passed he was handed
| his diploma, the result of his years of
i study and the testament that he was
now ready to try his hand at the
School of Life.
After the ceremonies were over,
j there were the usual congratulatory
i remarks and fond embraces of rela
tives. Slowly the crowds began to

disperse. And as the lengthening
shadows crept across the amphithea
ter, only the empty seats and the lit
ter of discarded programs remained
A warm sun and a clear sky
greeeted the 8,000 friends and
relatives of 2,875 graduating stu
dents last Sunday afternoon as
they foregathered at the Lau
rence Frost Amphitheater for
Stanford's sixtieth annual com
mencement exercise.
The crowds started to arrive at 4
p.m., and by the time the exercises
began at 5, the tree-lined bowl was
filled to overflowing with eager spec
tators. The ceremonies began as the
graduating students filed in from
both side of the outdoor theater to
the swelling music of the organ.
The plain, black-robed figures of
the candidates for the bachelor's de
gree led the procession. Behind them

came the more colorfully-garbed
candidates for advanced degrees, and !
finally, the faculty members.
Necks craned as the procession pa- 5
railed by. Proud parents sought a
glimpse of their children, while j
friends searched the passing faces for
a Bill or a Joan. Now and then there
would be a cry of recognition, fol
lowed by an exchange of greetings |
and the soft clicks and gentle whirs of
cameras.
The piping chords of the organ
ceased after the candidates had been |
seated. Eugene Meyers, the com
mencement orator, began his speech.
The voice of the chairman of the |
board of directors of the Washington j
Post came clearly over the loud
speakers. He traced the economic
development of the nation during his
lifetime and said:
'"The underdeveloped areas of the i

world, which is to say a majority of
the human race, are not willing to
linger patiently in poverty. They are
looking for an opportunity for prog
ress. They have a choice, even though
it is an illusory one, of associating
with Communist tyranny if no other
choice is offered.
"We have an opportunity, a difficult
one but nevertheless an opportunity,
of offering them a workable chance
to choose the path of freedom. By
hard work, by creative thinking, by
perseverance in the task, you can
create for them that opportunity.
