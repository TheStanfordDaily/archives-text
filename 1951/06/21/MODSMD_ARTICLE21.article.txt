Summer and the living is easy.
Athletic events are at a standstill during the summer quarter. We ask
ourselves, What s new for a column? ' and come up with many answers.
For instance: Results of the PCC tete-a-tetes, the Marietta, the NCAA, the
yoi-'hcoming AAU, and a preview of Stanford's athletic future.
Then we think further, first week of school, new students, new to the pic
'iire overs cue's gttting oriented, so we won't stop here. By-passing perhaps
no re pertinent subjects for a later date, we undertake to briefly acquaint
you with the results ol the major sports on the Farm this past year.
Host 1 Howl-IVlayhi' *5!
Turning back to fall 1950, we pick up King Football. Picked by many to
go to the Rose Bowl, the Indians started as if they were going to do just
ih.it, sweeping past San Jose State, USE, OSC, and Santa Clara. But Bowl
hopes were shattered in the L.A. Coliseum at the hands of UCLA. Coming
home the Cards 101 l to Washington, tied USC, and defeated Washington
State before going into the two big ones. Army invaded the Stadium on a
stormy November Saturday to splash by Stanford, 7 to 0. Stanford reached
its potential the following weekend. Completely outplaying California, the
Indians were held to a seven-seven tie, which ended Cal's three years of
undefeated, untied grid glory.
Gary Kerkorian's passing to Bill McColl and Bruce Van Alstyne coupled
with Bobby While's running accounted for much of the season's attack, while
■o-captains Gordy White and All-Coast Russ Pomeroy were the defensive
mainstays.
There were two firsts, one being Stanford's switch to the platoon sys
tem of play and the other was the naming of McColl on everyone's All-
Amcrican. Bill was the first Stanford player so honored since Chuck
Taylor in '12. Early in 1 1 Taylor was named to replace resigned head
coach Marchie Schwartz.
(.ajjt 1 \\ ins and Losses Even
In basketball, the Indians took their first six games then sporadically
opped seven more to end the year with an even split in twenty-six attempts.
A season highlight was the tilt against nationally-ranked Bradley, who edged
dtanfotd in the closing seconds. Ihe Cards took three of four played against
the Bears.
Ed Tucker scored 20!) points to finish second in the Southern Division
.scot ing i iice. Jim hamstead controlled the back boards together with ag
gressive Jim Walsh.
News here was Everett Dean dropping cage coaching to devote his
time to baseball. Erosh Coach Boh Burnett will take over this season.
Coach Weieishausei s track team didn t do well, because ol continual in
juries and individual failures. The Cards were upset by UCLA, San Jose
S'ate, and the Olympic Club. They surprised with a good showing against
h perennial champs, USC, by beating Fresno State, and trouncing the
Berkeley boys. Will Taylor and Bob Mathias were standouts. In the NCAA
Stanford disappointed, finishing in a tie for seventeenth. Mathias accounted
tor all nine of the Indian points. One chance remains on Saturday for re
demption when the AAU is run at Berkeley.
Diainoinlers Fail to Sparkle
The defending CIBA champions closed the diamond campaign with twenty
win:; and thirteen defeats. A high point was the three-out-of-fmir sweep of
the California series. The Cards finished third in the California Intercol
legiate Baseball Association behind the Trojans and UCLA. Jack Shepard
paced the batters with a . :»(»8 average.
A quick rundown of the other sports:
Swimming Tom Haynie's mermen won the PCC championship as well as
taking fourth in the NCAA.
Tennis—The netsters didn't fare well in the win and loss column.
Golf—'The linksters swept past all foes, conference and non-conference.
Trey are in the NCAA meet this weekend.
There's your Stanford sports orientation.
