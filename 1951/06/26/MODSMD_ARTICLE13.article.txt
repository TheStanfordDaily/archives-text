# Pavilion Will Hold Folkdancing Meets
## 
### 
The first meeting of the Village
Folkdancers for summer quarter
will be held tomorrow night from
7:30 to 10 in the Pavilion. For the
convenience of the entire student
body, the folkdancers are holding
their meetings on campus, free of
charge, instead of in the Village.
