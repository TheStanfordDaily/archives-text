# A 						Good Tradition
## 
### 
There is a tradition at Stanford which is always the subject of
an editorial when summer comes around. It is the "give-a-ride"
tradition.
You may have seen people standing under some signs at the
top of Palm Drive which say: "Give Ride to Palo Alto" or "Give
R:de to Village." Or you may have seen people standing at the
o'her end of Palm Drive with no signs at all. Or you may even be
one of those standing there.
Those people are students who have no means of transportation
and who are faced with the problem of getting to and from campus.
Their situation is more serious in summer because a large number
of the people who would ordinarily give them rides from the Vil
lage and from town are not here in summer.
So if you have a car, and if you see such people, stop and give
them a lift. You may help them get to school in time for their
classes or home in time for lunch. The periods between buses are
long and the summer days are hot. They will appreciate your help
and it will cost you nothing except a few seconds of your time.—
