It is generally conceded that the worst place in the world to have
car trouble is in the middle of the Mojave Desert. We had car
trouble in the middle of the Mojave Desert.
My traveling mate, Win Griffith, and I were steering our '40
Ford coupe through the ferocious 115-degree heat, when suddenly
Griff asked me, "Do you smell smoke?"
"No," I lied.
Suddenly, thick black fumes started pouring through the floor
boards, and trying to rationalize that there wasn't anything wrong
was as futile as slamming a swinging door. We pulled the car to
the side of the road and opened the hood. Steam and smoke ob
scured the engine.
Griff knows practically nothing about cars. I know less. Not
knowing what else to do, we consulted and prescribed the time
cure (let it cool), which was rather difficult considering the climate.
Having nothing better to do, I sat out in the middle of the desert
reading excerpts from John Gunther's "Inside U.S.A." My audi
ence was Griff, who sat in the car guzzling orange juice from a
thermos, and a few rattlesnakes who happened to slither by. The
ra-tlers apparently weren't interested in Gunther's writings and
went on their slimy way, which was all right with me. because I
don't like audiences when I read aloud. Especially a rattlesnake
audience.
After a while, we climbed into the car and limped into the near
est (you should excuse the expression) town, a one-horse burg
called Baker. There we turned our ailing vehicle over to the gas
station attendant, who proceeded to flood the radiator with water.
This obviously wasn't the right thing to do, because the car
started sputtering and wheezing worse than Jack Benny's Max
well. Suddenly there was an atomic explosion. Parts of the en
gine loosed themselves from the car and black liguids sguirted all
over. The gas station attendant allowed as to how maybe he didn't
do the right thing. We agreed.
People from a nearby cafe came running, and all Baker was
raised from its lethargy. It was the biggest thing that happened
to Baker since William Jennings Bryan gave a speech there.
All of which goes to prove that the Mojave Desert isn't the best
place to get car trouble, especially if you have to read "Inside
U.S.A." to disinterested rattlers.

the side of the road and opened the hood. Steam and smoke ob
scured the engine.
Griff knows practically nothing about cars. I know less. Not
knowing what else to do, we consulted and prescribed the time
cure (let it cool), which was rather difficult considering the climate.
Having nothing better to do, I sat out in the middle of the desert
reading excerpts from John Gunther's "Inside U.S.A." My audi
ence was Griff, who sat in the car guzzling orange juice from a
thermos, and a few rattlesnakes who happened to slither by. The
ra-tlers apparently weren't interested in Gunther's writings and
went on their slimy way, which was all right with me. because I
don't like audiences when I read aloud. Especially a rattlesnake
audience.
After a while, we climbed into the car and limped into the near
est (you should excuse the expression) town, a one-horse burg
called Baker. There we turned our ailing vehicle over to the gas
station attendant, who proceeded to flood the radiator with water.
This obviously wasn't the right thing to do, because the car
started sputtering and wheezing worse than Jack Benny's Max
well. Suddenly there was an atomic explosion. Parts of the en
gine loosed themselves from the car and black liguids sguirted all
over. The gas station attendant allowed as to how maybe he didn't
do the right thing. We agreed.
People from a nearby cafe came running, and all Baker was
raised from its lethargy. It was the biggest thing that happened
to Baker since William Jennings Bryan gave a speech there.
All of which goes to prove that the Mojave Desert isn't the best
place to get car trouble, especially if you have to read "Inside
U.S.A." to disinterested rattlers.
