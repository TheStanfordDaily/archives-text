# Bryan, Held Win in AAU Meet; Mathias, Davis Place
## Gay a Second Too; Bud Sets Record 
### CHUCK THOMAS 
Former Stanford athletes took
two firsts and three other places in i
the G3rd AAU track and Held chain- j
pionships at Berkeley over the |
weekend. What with Olympic team i
stars and world champions all over j
the place, the meet established ex- |
Indians Gay Bryan. Bud Held, Bob j
Mathias, and Lew Davis among the I
nation's best . And the results went |
a long way toward settling that old
argument about Bryan and Mathias j
being just very good in everything ;
and not really great in anything. I
BRYAN NABS TWO PLACES
Bryan grabbed individual honors
in the two - day affair by placing
lirst in one event and second in an- ,
other. Gay took a hop, a skip, and i
a jump, and ended up 4(i ft. 11 1 •> in, j
from where he started—far enough !
to win the national championship ;
by almost a foot.
Bryan's 24-ft. 2-in. broadjump
was over a foot shy of his best
effort, and twice that far from the
world record. But it was worth a
second-place medal in the Berkeley
track-fest.
Bud Held brought out his Sun
day-best javelin throw on Satur
day, and won that event by almost
eight feet. Hold's heave of 241 ft.
i in. was short of the world mark,
but it was Bud's all-time best and !
set a new Edwards Stadium record. I
MATHIAS FOURTH IN U.S.
Mathias' performance in the dis
cus was a little disappointing —if j
placing fourth in the nation can i
ever be called disappointing. Bob's j
toss of 1(53 It. 2 1 4 in. was over ten j

feet short of his best effort this year, I
and if he had equaled his mark in
the Big Ten-PCC meet lie could
have won the event.
But Mathias has established him
self as a potential champion with
the platter, and the "experts" who J
said he'd never be first class in any j
one event can go off in the corner i
with the boys who picked the Seals ,
for the first division.
Stanford's southpaw shot putter,
Lew Davis, took sixth as USC j
sophomore Parry O'Brien was up- i
setting world record holder Jim j
Fuchs. Davis' push went 49 ft. s : \s
in. The Olympic Club's real threat
in the event, ex-Indian Otis Chan
dler, didn't enter—he was too busy '
honeymooning.
