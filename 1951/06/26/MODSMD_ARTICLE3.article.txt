## 
### 
All hands are invited to attend
the Lagunita open house, the first
ASSU-sponsored all-campus social
event of the summer, Saturday
from 9 p.m. to 1. It is a no-date
affair.
A band will play for outside
dancing, and ice cream cones and
punch refreshments will be served.
Lisa Thacker, chairman of the
event, said the objective is to get
everyone attending the summer
quarter together at one big party to
get acquainted.
