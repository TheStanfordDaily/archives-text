I In* Fifth Annual Staniord University Coaching Clinic ended Friday.
ltealty a very unique, interestiiv;, and worthwhile project.
Ihe Clinic is open to all coaches and may be taken for two units of
University credit. Notables come from far and wide to give and take
football knowledge. A majority of those present were high school and
junior college mentors. Among the more prominent college coaches were
Ilowie Odell ol Washington, Dick Gallagher of Santa Clara, and naturally
the Stanford coaching staff.
H«*l(l Demonstration by Forlv-INiners
1 missed the Wednesday sessions held in Cubberley, which consisted
mostly ol movies, talks, and an introduction to football at Stanford by
head man Chuck Taylor. However, at 1:30 Thursday ! was at the frosh
field to watch l<rankie Albert, all-time Stanford great and present QB
for the San Francisco Forty-Niners. teach the rudiments of the quarter
hack s part in the T-tormation. Center for the demonstration was Vic
Lindskog, ex-Card gridder who now performs for the Philadelphia Eagles.
Among other field demonstrations were offensive and defensive line
play, end play, and various techniques of blocking. I got the biggest kick
out ol the play development and play patterns put on by a contingent of
I' orty-Niners. There were ex-Stanford players Bruno Bandueci. Norm
Standiee, and Albert. Lindskog of the Eagles and Milt Vucinich, a non
play-for-pay boy, took pint. Card Coaches Taylor and Pete Kmetovic
were active. Two Forty-Niners, but not Stanford players, were John
Stryzkalski and Hal Shoener. It was a very good show to see the pros
run through end sweeps, quick openers, and assorted pass patterns.
kidding Back and Forth
The afternoon was not without its humor. Constant kidding between
the players kept the coach-filled bleachers in good spirits despite the
broiling sun. I remember the quip of Tuylor, "Pete, you're slowing up,"
directed to Kmetovic as he looked just a wee bit slower getting away from
his halfback spot than in his Stanford days. Also Lindskoq throwing a
blade of grass in the air to see which way the wind was blowing. Then he
directed Albert to stand over there to take the pass from center on a punt
so that he could be centering with the wind and "not look so bnd" cen
tering over such a long distance after being accustomed to just snapping
the ball into the QB's hands. The players trying to get rid of a little
weight before Forty-Niner training opens in mid-July. You know, get
down to playing trim, around 230, 220, or maybe even as light as 200.
Another impression was the " reunion" of so many Woy Boys of the
Stanford Hose Bawl champs of 1940 on one field. Albert, Standiee. Ban
ducci. Lindskog, Taylor, Vucinich, and Kmetovic all played on Stan
ford's last !<;reat team.

the Stanford coaching staff.
H«*l(l Demonstration by Forlv-INiners
1 missed the Wednesday sessions held in Cubberley, which consisted
mostly ol movies, talks, and an introduction to football at Stanford by
head man Chuck Taylor. However, at 1:30 Thursday ! was at the frosh
field to watch l<rankie Albert, all-time Stanford great and present QB
for the San Francisco Forty-Niners. teach the rudiments of the quarter
hack s part in the T-tormation. Center for the demonstration was Vic
Lindskog, ex-Card gridder who now performs for the Philadelphia Eagles.
Among other field demonstrations were offensive and defensive line
play, end play, and various techniques of blocking. I got the biggest kick
out ol the play development and play patterns put on by a contingent of
I' orty-Niners. There were ex-Stanford players Bruno Bandueci. Norm
Standiee, and Albert. Lindskog of the Eagles and Milt Vucinich, a non
play-for-pay boy, took pint. Card Coaches Taylor and Pete Kmetovic
were active. Two Forty-Niners, but not Stanford players, were John
Stryzkalski and Hal Shoener. It was a very good show to see the pros
run through end sweeps, quick openers, and assorted pass patterns.
kidding Back and Forth
The afternoon was not without its humor. Constant kidding between
the players kept the coach-filled bleachers in good spirits despite the
broiling sun. I remember the quip of Tuylor, "Pete, you're slowing up,"
directed to Kmetovic as he looked just a wee bit slower getting away from
his halfback spot than in his Stanford days. Also Lindskoq throwing a
blade of grass in the air to see which way the wind was blowing. Then he
directed Albert to stand over there to take the pass from center on a punt
so that he could be centering with the wind and "not look so bnd" cen
tering over such a long distance after being accustomed to just snapping
the ball into the QB's hands. The players trying to get rid of a little
weight before Forty-Niner training opens in mid-July. You know, get
down to playing trim, around 230, 220, or maybe even as light as 200.
Another impression was the " reunion" of so many Woy Boys of the
Stanford Hose Bawl champs of 1940 on one field. Albert, Standiee. Ban
ducci. Lindskog, Taylor, Vucinich, and Kmetovic all played on Stan
ford's last !<;reat team.

ltealty a very unique, interestiiv;, and worthwhile project.
Ihe Clinic is open to all coaches and may be taken for two units of
