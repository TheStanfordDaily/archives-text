# 'Orpheus' Uses Classic Legend in Surrealist Form
## 
### JOHN BUSH DICK FREDELL 
The genius so evident in ''Beauty j
and the Beast" is with us again in j
Jean Cocteau's "Orpheus," ndw at ,
the Clay in San Francisco.
As in the Greek myth, Orpheus is
a much lionized poet—though the
locale has been shifted to the Left
Bank—and again Eurydice cannot

compete for at- |
tention with her I
husband's art. j
She dies, and
Orpheus, com- j
pel 1 e d by re- J
morse, goes to j
th e underworld i
to retrieve her. I
Also true to the
original, he loses
her once again

—and this time there is no appeal—

! because he looks at her, contrary to
orders. But here M. Cocteau draws
I the line, and leaves Bullfinch for
■ the purists to mull over in a sunlit
I vineyard.
Orpheus, ably played by Jean j
Marais (whose relationship with j
Cocteau still intrigues those who !
have failed to acquire composure !
enough not to be intrigued by para
philia), is preoccupied with love j
and death. The film deals chiefly

with some rather recondite aspects 1
of those phenomena.
Of the classical legend, only the '
hardest part of the core remains. It !
has become the vehicle for Coc- 1
teau's surrealist virtuosity. His j
l symbols are ambiguous — as they j
' ought to be. Objectivity — in the !
j usual sense—would be the death of
I the surrealist's art. Cocteau is pow-
I erfully articulate with his symbols, ;
j and he is not an obscurantist— |
i there is no faking here.
| Actually, about the only system-
I atic way of judging the success of !
j this sort of art is the mass applica
tion of the encephalography Lack- i
ing a battery of those machines, one
1 must simply go and see for himself,
and for himself alone. Then, he can
| crouch over a glass of little red j
[ adequacy and make carping remarks
! about the myriad other interpreta

tions, none of which fits quite as
■ well as his own.
1 But useful as it may be to try to
j pin down specific symbolistic de- j
; vices, such mental gymnastics,
when carried very far, only con- |
| found the issue. The impact of the
j work is felt in one degree or an- j
other, and to try to objectivize it
promises only limited success, be-
I cause this is a non-objective me
dium of emotional and intellectual
j communication. Once a rapport is
| set up between artist and audience,
both can use the creative faculty.
! M. Cocteau is singularly adept at

his own end of this rather nebulous
business. "Orpheus," being distinct
ly better than his most recent
works, is singularly good evidence
of his genius.

At the Altos: "Ma and Pa Kettle
Back on the Farm." This is sup

Jean Cocteau's "Orpheus," ndw at ,

As in the Greek myth, Orpheus is
a much lionized poet—though the
locale has been shifted to the Left
Bank—and again Eurydice cannot

compete for at- |
tention with her I
husband's art. j
She dies, and
Orpheus, com- j
pel 1 e d by re- J
morse, goes to j
th e underworld i
to retrieve her. I
Also true to the
original, he loses
her once again

—and this time there is no appeal—

! because he looks at her, contrary to
orders. But here M. Cocteau draws
I the line, and leaves Bullfinch for
■ the purists to mull over in a sunlit
I vineyard.
Orpheus, ably played by Jean j
Marais (whose relationship with j
Cocteau still intrigues those who !
have failed to acquire composure !
enough not to be intrigued by para
philia), is preoccupied with love j
and death. The film deals chiefly

with some rather recondite aspects 1
of those phenomena.
Of the classical legend, only the '
hardest part of the core remains. It !
has become the vehicle for Coc- 1
teau's surrealist virtuosity. His j
l symbols are ambiguous — as they j
' ought to be. Objectivity — in the !
j usual sense—would be the death of
I the surrealist's art. Cocteau is pow-
I erfully articulate with his symbols, ;
j and he is not an obscurantist— |
i there is no faking here.
| Actually, about the only system-
I atic way of judging the success of !
j this sort of art is the mass applica
tion of the encephalography Lack- i
ing a battery of those machines, one
1 must simply go and see for himself,
and for himself alone. Then, he can
| crouch over a glass of little red j
[ adequacy and make carping remarks
! about the myriad other interpreta

tions, none of which fits quite as
■ well as his own.
1 But useful as it may be to try to
j pin down specific symbolistic de- j
; vices, such mental gymnastics,
when carried very far, only con- |
| found the issue. The impact of the
j work is felt in one degree or an- j
other, and to try to objectivize it
promises only limited success, be-
