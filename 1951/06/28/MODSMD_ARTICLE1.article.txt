### WILLIAM PETROPOULOS 
A fair lady and her 12 tiny ba
bies got into a jam in front of
the library a couple of days ago
and had to be rescued by some
heroic Stanford men.
But this was no ordinary case
of distress. The unfortunates
were quail, and the pitfall, a
grated manhole cover.
Mama quail was out showing
otf her new children to the Stan
ford campus. At 3 p.m. she strut
ted across Lasuen Street toward
the Main Library, head held high
and followed by her babies strung
out in a long' line.
In fact. Mama's head was so

high she didn't see the manhole
grate she walked over. Neither
did the babies, and they were so
small they fell in.
A crowd from the Library gath
ered, and it was roughs to the
rescue as several alert students
went to the quails' aid.
At first Mama belligerently
took to the air and angrily cir
cled around as the men neared
her precious babies. But then she
realized they were helping, and
in her own quiet quail way she
landed in the nearest tree and
patiently waited while the roughs
rescued the tiny ones from their
prison and gently set them on the
lawn.
