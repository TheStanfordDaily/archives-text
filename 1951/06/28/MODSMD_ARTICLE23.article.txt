### HELEN KESSEL 
? or newcomers to the Farm,
w< 're tearing out a page or two
from our Dictionary of Campus
Jargon. Here's part of the list
w 've acquired during our past
three years at Stanford:
EIGHT O'CLOCK — A required
course, always. Beforehand, groggy
in bed at seven-fifteen, you flip of!
the alarm and turn over to get
forty winks fnore. ("The prof'll
ne/er test us on this lecture.")
Come finals, and the questions on
the exam sheet are not from the
b< >i)k (which you've managed to
re;id thoroughly) but from the lec
tures—the ones you didn't go to.
SUNDAY MOVIES —The Great
er* Little Show in the World, and
all for twenty cents. Where you
boo the hero and cheer the villain,
and spend Monday through next
Sunday wondering how Crash Cor
rigon and Billy will escape the fire
from the invisible ray.
OEAD WEEK —The week before
finals, when you read the text for
the first time.
CELLAR COFFEE — A five -cent
liquid refreshment that's not so bad
as everyone says it is, but some
thing that you too will say is awful,
just to keep the conversation going.

MAIN LIRE During the first
few weeks of the quarter, The
Place to see people and to party
time at the 8-8:30 break; during
Dead Week and Finals, The Place
to study.
RIDES TRADITION -One of the
greatest traditions at the Farm (and
we're not kidding.) When you're
driving into Paly or back to campus
and you see a student by the Oak
Tree or in front of the Bookstore
or Wilson's, give 'em a lift. It'll be
appreciated. There are some of us
who don't h»ve cars!
(Note: The following items are
for New Women Only.)
BUZZERS—LittIe blasts that jolt
you with a boisterous clatter. When
you come in Monday night from the
Libe, the bobby pin has toppled off,
and you spend the next two days
listening patiently, wondering if it
was l>e who called.
HOOVER TOWER —The highest
building on campus, on which gi
gantic footprints mysteriously ap
pear once or twice a year. A word
to the wise: Proper dress for the
Top o' the Tower is a tight skirt.
It can get awfully windy up there.
CACTUS GARDENS Better ask
your sponsor about this one. It's
not just a garden where they grow
cactus.
