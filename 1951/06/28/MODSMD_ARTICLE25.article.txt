## 
### 
A brief survey of Iran's size,
population and people com
menced an informative talk giv
en by Dr. Robert Gulick Jr., in
the first Tuesday Evening Series
address of the quarter, "Iran,
1951: Oil and Turmoil."
He said that the inhabitants of
the area which we know sometimes
; as Persians have always regarded
I themselves as Iranians. The Greeks
were responsible for the populariz-
I ing of "Persians" and the name has
| been handed down to us through
l the King James translation of the
I Bible.
To a very attentive audience Dr.
Gulick described the Persian people
as "intelligent, witty, warm-heart
i ed, but envious. They have the
i feeling that foreign domination is
the root ol all economic and social
problems.
"The nationalistic movement is
I not Communistic in origin. The
movement in Iran" is political and
spiritual, and cannot be expiated
! by economic measures alone."
After tracing briefly the history
! of Britain's interests in Iran and the
| Anglo - Iranian Oil Company, Dr.
I Gulick said, "The Persians are un-
I willing to negotiate on one point—
they want the British ofT their
| backs.
"With Britain as our ally, our

number one friend, and with Iran
supplying her navy with most of
its oil, it is most logical that the
United States should be involved in
the problem today."
"However," Dr. Guliek warned
the audience in closing, "we cannot
go in (to Iran) as a ruling class.
Co-partnership is the only key to
the solution of economic develop
ment."
