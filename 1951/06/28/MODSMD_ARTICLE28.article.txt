# CHUCK THOMAS
## Time Out 
### 
There's been much weeping and
gnashing of teeth in the small vil
lage of Berkeley (Calif.) lately
about the new PCC-Big Ten Rose
Bowl agreement. It seems the local
peasantry is unhappy because their
answer to P. T. Barnum, Pappy
Waldorf, won't be able to take his
Golden Clowns south for their an
nual three-ring circus on Jan. 1.
The Berkeleyans just may have
something here. Ever since this

Midwestern in
vasion of Pasa
de n a on New
Year's Day
started, the PCC
and the Big Ten
have been about
a s chummy a s
Dean Acheson
at a Republican
convention. And
this California
business might

Chuck Thomas be just the thing
for a little cupid work. The only
trouble with the champions of the
Golden Clowns' cause is that they
haven't gone far enough.
LET'S MAKE IT A HABIT
We shouldn't just ALLOW Cali
fornia to go to the Rose Bowl THIS
year. We ought to stick them in
1-A right now, and then DRAFT
them to go EVERY year.
Look at it this way. The PCC and
the Big Ten have been fussing
around about how often the con
ference champ can display its wares
at Pasadena. "Cal in the Rose
Bowl" and "Waldorf for President"
are the perfect answer.
The Big Ten would be as happy
as Rita Hayworth with a new di
vorce to see the Golden Clowns in
Pasadena every year. It wouldn't
make any difference WHO they
send out here then. Besides, it's
only fair to Michigan State to keep
the way open for them to prepare
for spring training by closing out
the year with a good practice
scrimmage on New Year's Day.
Why, with victory assured be
yond doubt, the University of Chi
cago might even lift their old ban
on athletics and rake up a touch
tackle team to get into the holiday
spirit.
SOLVES TICKET TROUBLES TOO
But that isn't all. With California
playing Santa Clara at Pasadena
every year, the Big Ten's ticket
problems would be solved, too. The
4.000 extra seats the Mid westerners
are asking will be strictly small
change. Just about one more per
formance by the Golden Clowns
like the last three, and selling Rose
Bowl tickets will be like hustling
popsicles to Eskimos.
Let's face it. The Clowns de
serve that Rose Bowl trip. It would
be a shame to break the record of
a show that's been running almost
asi long as "Oklahoma!"
After all. who ever heard of a cir
cus running for three straight years
before? And without a bearded
lady, too. Which reminds me, how
is Jensen doing with the Yanks?

convention. And
this California
business might

Chuck Thomas be just the thing
for a little cupid work. The only
trouble with the champions of the
Golden Clowns' cause is that they
haven't gone far enough.
LET'S MAKE IT A HABIT
We shouldn't just ALLOW Cali
fornia to go to the Rose Bowl THIS
year. We ought to stick them in
1-A right now, and then DRAFT
them to go EVERY year.
Look at it this way. The PCC and
the Big Ten have been fussing
around about how often the con
ference champ can display its wares
at Pasadena. "Cal in the Rose
Bowl" and "Waldorf for President"
are the perfect answer.
The Big Ten would be as happy
as Rita Hayworth with a new di
vorce to see the Golden Clowns in
Pasadena every year. It wouldn't
make any difference WHO they
send out here then. Besides, it's
only fair to Michigan State to keep
the way open for them to prepare
for spring training by closing out
the year with a good practice
scrimmage on New Year's Day.
Why, with victory assured be
yond doubt, the University of Chi
cago might even lift their old ban
on athletics and rake up a touch
tackle team to get into the holiday
spirit.
SOLVES TICKET TROUBLES TOO
But that isn't all. With California
playing Santa Clara at Pasadena
every year, the Big Ten's ticket
problems would be solved, too. The
4.000 extra seats the Mid westerners
are asking will be strictly small
change. Just about one more per
formance by the Golden Clowns
like the last three, and selling Rose
Bowl tickets will be like hustling
popsicles to Eskimos.
Let's face it. The Clowns de
serve that Rose Bowl trip. It would
be a shame to break the record of
a show that's been running almost
asi long as "Oklahoma!"
After all. who ever heard of a cir
cus running for three straight years
before? And without a bearded
lady, too. Which reminds me, how
is Jensen doing with the Yanks?

There's been much weeping and
gnashing of teeth in the small vil
lage of Berkeley (Calif.) lately
about the new PCC-Big Ten Rose
Bowl agreement. It seems the local
peasantry is unhappy because their
answer to P. T. Barnum, Pappy
Waldorf, won't be able to take his
Golden Clowns south for their an
nual three-ring circus on Jan. 1.
The Berkeleyans just may have
something here. Ever since this

Midwestern in
vasion of Pasa
de n a on New
Year's Day
started, the PCC
and the Big Ten
have been about
a s chummy a s
Dean Acheson
at a Republican
convention. And
