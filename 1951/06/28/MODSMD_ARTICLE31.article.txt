NCAA golf tourney held Monday
and Tuesday on the 7.000-yard Ohio

ed 014 strokes for 30 holes, for an
average of about 77 strokes per man
per round. North Texas State won
the tourney with an impressive 588
score. Stanford's great 1941 quar
tette holds the all-time team low
score of 580.
Number one man Dick McElyea
had difficulty keeping out of the
numerous traps that dot the beau
tiful course, but he still led the
Indian linksters in with a 75-77-152.
McElyea has difficulty shining on
a long course such as this one, as
his near - professional short game
proves of little avail against some
of the longer hitters. To add to his
woes,' McElyea and John Elliot, who
carded an 82-79-101, both suffered
an attack of food - poisoning the
night before the festivities began.
The Cards' regular number two
man, Jack Knosher, came- in with
150, and erratic Roland Conklin
shot a steady 153. Art Shroeder also
carded a 153. Keith Beekman
rounded out the attack with a 157.
Stanford still has a little chance
for. glory, as the 04 low scorers have
begun shooting to determine an in
dividual champion. McElyea. Kno
sher, Conklin. and Shroeder quali
fied for this competitino.
Detroit's Sam Kocsis, tourney
medalist with 141, and San Jose
State's colorful Ken Venturi rate as
slight favorites to capture the indi
vidual crown, but upsets always
reign in long elimination match
play.
