# Outstanding Performances Highlight ‘Oliver Twist’
## 
### JOHN BUSH DICK FREDELL 
Some will say it is better than !
"Great Expectations," some that it
is not quite so good, but everyone j
will have to agree that J. Arthur '
Rank's presentation of "Oliver
Twist" is a fine motion picture.
The Dickens classic, now at the
Guild in Menlo, has all the human !
insight, social commentary, satire,
and humor of the novel, and if the ,
film is not letter-faithful to the j
original, we can only say that any :
changes are entirely effective.
Art forms, after all, differ; what i
goes well in print is not identical !
with what goes well on film. Only
a few cultists are going to quarrel ,
with the brilliant and imaginative I
Ronald Name-David Lean produc- !
tion of "Oliver Twist," for the Dick- j
ens flavor is left completely intact, |
the story almost completely so.

The movie is highlighted by
startlingly good photography and
1 an enviable collection of superior
performances. The versatile Alec
Guiness adds Fagin to his dizzying
catalogue of great chaarcter inter
pretations in- a performance which,
' if anyone remained unconvinced
1 after "Kind Hearts and Coronets,"
j establishes Guiness beyond doubt
; as. one of the outstanding actors of
our day.
Not only does he bring out Fa
i gin's miserliness and cruelty, but
he manages also to imply, with a
! subtlety which could not offend
! even a maiden aunt from lowa,
Fagin's homosexuality.
Robert Newton plays the bestial
Bill Sikes, and Kay Walsh is the
kind - hearted Nancy, both well
i done. And John Howard Davies
pifiys Oliver Twist with a charm,
j warmth, and skill gratil'yingly free

of the wooden cloyishness which
characterizes the Hollywood knee- j
| pants set.
The picture is full of memorable I
scenes. We are all but defied to
forget Fagin and the Artful Dodger
illustrating the methods of pick
j pocketing; Oliver running through
I the dark streets of London with the
enraged citizenry at his heels; and
I the suspenseful climax in which
Sikes tries to escape his murderer's
| doom by fleeing over a rooftop with
j Oliver.
