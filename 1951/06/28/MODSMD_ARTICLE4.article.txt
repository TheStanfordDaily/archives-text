Thursday, June 28 â€” Communist
troops exploded heavy attacks on
the western and east central Ko

Chinese believed fresh from Man
churia massed in western Korea.
But the United Nations forces
counter-attacked and restored their
positions, inflicting heavy losses on
the Reds, the front dispatch said.
