THE CONSPIRACY IN KANSAS
1 put a motion before the house
right now that the Kansas Chamber
of Commerce should be spanked red
and sent to dinner without its pab
lum.
This 1 say for two reasons. One
Js that Kansas isn't all it is cracked
up to be. Remember the song "I'm
the Sunflower of the Sunflower
State"? Well, don't believe it. Not
one sunflower did Griff and I spot.
We saw a few bushy lower cousins
of the sunflower, but not one real
sunflower.
Remember the song from "South
Pacific" where Mary Martin sings,
"I'm as corny as Kansas in Au
gust"? Well, don't believe it. More
Chamber of Commerce promotions.
A few scrawny fields of corn was
all that met our eyes.
Secondly, I suspect that someone
tipped off the Chamber of Com
merce that I was entering the state,
and fearing that I would write an
expose on Kansas, they did every
thing ill their power to prevent us
from getting into the state and to
make it unpleasant after we got in.
Just before we got to the Kansas
state line, our lights went dut. This
was unfortunate, because it was
night. And it was raining. Even
the brilliant streak lightning which
bleached the countryside every ten
seconds wasn't enough to guide us.
Remembering the Everyready
flashlight advertisements that show

I 'their lights saving people from
fearful tragedies, I pulled out a
| flashlight of another brand, and we
! crawled back to a nondescript town
called Burlington, Colorado.
Our lights were fixed, and we left
i Burlington forever and a day.
About 20 feet before the Kansas
\ border, our motor made some in—
! coherent mutterings and then sput
j tered away into nothingness. One
hour and 360 streaks of lightning
later, we were on our way through
Kansas. And on our way through
1 the worst floods that I have ever
| seen. .«*
The whole countryside had been
swamped with rains, and many
j roads were washed out.
This was another Chamber of
Commerce trick to make it un
! pleasant for us. The roads were so
j bad that at one point we had to
| make a detour of a detour of a de
! tour of a detour of our regular road.
On most of these roads there were
trucks with ten-mile-an-hour speed
limits, and all the trucks wagged a
I long tail of cars behind them.
But don't get me wrong. This
j isn't an expose on Kansas. This is
an expose on the Kansas Chamber
jof Commerce. I like Kansas.
Most of all, 1 like the people.
They're friendly and unpretentious
in Kansas.
But I don't like the Chamber of

sunflower.
Remember the song from "South
Pacific" where Mary Martin sings,
"I'm as corny as Kansas in Au
gust"? Well, don't believe it. More
Chamber of Commerce promotions.
A few scrawny fields of corn was
all that met our eyes.
Secondly, I suspect that someone
tipped off the Chamber of Com
merce that I was entering the state,
and fearing that I would write an
expose on Kansas, they did every
thing ill their power to prevent us
from getting into the state and to
make it unpleasant after we got in.
Just before we got to the Kansas
state line, our lights went dut. This
was unfortunate, because it was
night. And it was raining. Even
the brilliant streak lightning which
bleached the countryside every ten
seconds wasn't enough to guide us.
Remembering the Everyready
flashlight advertisements that show

I 'their lights saving people from
fearful tragedies, I pulled out a
| flashlight of another brand, and we
! crawled back to a nondescript town
called Burlington, Colorado.
Our lights were fixed, and we left
i Burlington forever and a day.
About 20 feet before the Kansas
\ border, our motor made some in—
! coherent mutterings and then sput
j tered away into nothingness. One
hour and 360 streaks of lightning
later, we were on our way through
Kansas. And on our way through
1 the worst floods that I have ever
| seen. .«*
The whole countryside had been
swamped with rains, and many
j roads were washed out.
This was another Chamber of
Commerce trick to make it un
! pleasant for us. The roads were so
j bad that at one point we had to
| make a detour of a detour of a de
! tour of a detour of our regular road.
On most of these roads there were
trucks with ten-mile-an-hour speed
limits, and all the trucks wagged a
I long tail of cars behind them.
But don't get me wrong. This
j isn't an expose on Kansas. This is
an expose on the Kansas Chamber
jof Commerce. I like Kansas.
Most of all, 1 like the people.
They're friendly and unpretentious
in Kansas.
But I don't like the Chamber of
Commerce. They're advertising the
wrong things.
THE CONSPIRACY IN KANSAS
1 put a motion before the house
right now that the Kansas Chamber
of Commerce should be spanked red
and sent to dinner without its pab
lum.
This 1 say for two reasons. One
Js that Kansas isn't all it is cracked
up to be. Remember the song "I'm
the Sunflower of the Sunflower
State"? Well, don't believe it. Not
one sunflower did Griff and I spot.
We saw a few bushy lower cousins
of the sunflower, but not one real
sunflower.
