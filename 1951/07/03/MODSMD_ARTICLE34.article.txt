# $50,000 Bonus Baby
## 
### 
According to the lad's father, Ed
was destined to come to Stanford if

no outfit offered
a fair bonus
pri c e for his
signature. I
agree that fifty
gran d may be
worth sacrificing
a college educa
tion for, even
one at Stanford.
Young Ed,
who just grad-

uated from Jefferson High up the
road a bit, had an almost unbeliev
able record of high school and win
ter league mound successes. He
pitched seven no-bitters, 39 shut
outs, in 158 starts. In these games
he has averaged a speck over one
base on balls per game while strik
ing out twelve. He boasts an
earned-run average of four-fifths
of a run per game.
On the brighter side is the ease
oi Rich Scramaglia. Scramaglia, a
speedy, All-City <San Francisco)
.second-sacker from "Sacred Heart,
will enter Stanford. This gives a
more sparkling look to Stanford's
diamond problem.
