An after thought on the Football
Coaching Clinic held ten days back:
It was satisfying to actually see
Stanford coaches taking an active
part in the goings-on.
Head man Chuck Taylor was an
nouncing the whole affair.
Backfield Coach Pete Kmetovic
was running plays from halfback, a
spot very familiar to Pete in bis
former Stanford days.
George Lynn, former backfield
coach from Oklahoma, was showing
aspects of the derivation of the T,
the Split T.
It was rejuvenating to see the
new line coach, Joe Ruetz, throw
ing rolling, cross body, and other
blocks to get his points across to
the visiting coaches.
It will pay off this fall to have
just such a staff, one which will get
in there with the players, mix it up,
and show them exactly what they
are doing wrong.
There has been some amazement
at the choosing of such a young
staff, but whatever the coaches lack
in experience and know - how,
which I think is nil, they will more
than compensate for in their active
participation and spirit.
