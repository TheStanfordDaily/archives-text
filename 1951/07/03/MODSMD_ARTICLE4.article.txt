### 
The Stanford Players' presentation of S. N. Behrman's "Biogra
phy" opens tomorrow night at 8:15 in the Little Theater with Lois
Moran and John Dodds heading the company's cast.
Miss Moran has the role of Marion Froude, a painter who decides
to record the facts of her interesting—but somewhat shady—past

in a biography. One of the chapters
of her life-story involves an affair
with Leander Nolan, played by Pro
fssor Dodds.
Politics vs. Publicity
Nolan has political ambitions, and
the publication of Miss Froude's
biography doesn't fit in well with
his publicity campaign. Nolan's at
tempts to dissuade Miss Froude
from making his private life public
are complicated by her amorous at
tentions to her publisher's agent,
Richard Kurt, player by Richard
Cox.
Miss Moran is well known for
her work in both the theater and
motion pictures. This summer she
is an artist-in-residence at Stan
ford. i
