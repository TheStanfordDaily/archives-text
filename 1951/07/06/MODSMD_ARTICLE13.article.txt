A WALK WITH HAKRY
WASHINGTON, D.C.—I got up at
5 o'clock this morning to take my
morning walk. This I never do un
less it's to take a walk with the
President of the United States.
It's a known fact that robust
Harry Truman takes a walk around
the park between 6 and 6:30 a.m.
' Lilo' gave it a write-up once. This
is why I got up at 5 a.m. I wanted
to give the Chief Executive's con
stitutional a write-up in The Daily.
1 drove from my hotel to Blair
House, where Harry and his spouse
an i his daughter break bread three
times a day. The White House is
being repaired, and won't be open
to traffic until 1952.
I had no illusions of walking side
b> -side with Harry, because this
light is reserved to 10 secret serv
ice men who encircle him as he
takes his hrisk stroll.
Ever since some Puerto Ricans
tried to do away with the Presi
dent, he has been fantastically well
guarded. The sidewalk that passes
in front of Blair House is roped off
for the entire block. There are six
little police stations on the block
plus guards, about 20 in all.
This is not to mention the four
secret service men who never leave
his side and the six more who join
him when he leaves Blair House.
The secret service men never let
Truman take the same route two
days in a row. On£ day he may
leave by the side Entrance and walk
through the middle of the police
protected Park, and another day he
may leave by the front and walk on
oni? side of the park.
Sometimes, a man who is dressed
and looks like Truman takes a walk

around the park, surrounded by the
special guard. Then, 15 minutes
later, Harry will take his walk.
I parked the car and walked
along the sidewalk on the opposite
side of Blair House. I heard a
strange noise coming from Blair
House, which I figured was Marga
ret singing in the showers.
I purposely avoid writing a criti
cism of the noise, because I don't
like to get indignant letters from
the President of the United States.
As I walked down the street, sev
eral plainclothesmen with bulges
in their pockets told me to ' move
along." These bulges, I am told, are
more than just excess Kleenex.
As I continued walking, more
men told me to move along. And I
am always happy to comply with
the wishes of men who wear plain
clothes. Especially men who wear
plain clothes who have bulges in
their pockets.
Now, as I have stated, I had no
visions of walking side -by - side
with Harry, and discussing the state
of the Union and the folks back in
Independence. I just wanted to get
a glimpse of him. But more men in
plain clothes with bulges in their
pockets kept telling me to move
along, until finally I was a tele
scopic distance from Blair House.
Shrewdly, I circled back and got
in the house across the street from
Blair House and watched the en
trance. To make a long, sad story
a short, sad story, Mr. President
never took his constitutional. And
all I did for two and a half hours
was watch men in plain clothes pa
trol back and forth in front of Blair
House.
With bulges in their pockets.

to give the Chief Executive's con
stitutional a write-up in The Daily.
1 drove from my hotel to Blair
House, where Harry and his spouse
an i his daughter break bread three
times a day. The White House is
being repaired, and won't be open
to traffic until 1952.
I had no illusions of walking side
b> -side with Harry, because this
light is reserved to 10 secret serv
ice men who encircle him as he
takes his hrisk stroll.
Ever since some Puerto Ricans
tried to do away with the Presi
dent, he has been fantastically well
guarded. The sidewalk that passes
in front of Blair House is roped off
for the entire block. There are six
little police stations on the block
plus guards, about 20 in all.
This is not to mention the four
secret service men who never leave
his side and the six more who join
him when he leaves Blair House.
The secret service men never let
Truman take the same route two
days in a row. On£ day he may
leave by the side Entrance and walk
through the middle of the police
protected Park, and another day he
may leave by the front and walk on
oni? side of the park.
Sometimes, a man who is dressed
and looks like Truman takes a walk

around the park, surrounded by the
special guard. Then, 15 minutes
later, Harry will take his walk.
I parked the car and walked
along the sidewalk on the opposite
side of Blair House. I heard a
strange noise coming from Blair
House, which I figured was Marga
ret singing in the showers.
I purposely avoid writing a criti
cism of the noise, because I don't
like to get indignant letters from
the President of the United States.
As I walked down the street, sev
eral plainclothesmen with bulges
in their pockets told me to ' move
along." These bulges, I am told, are
more than just excess Kleenex.
As I continued walking, more
men told me to move along. And I
am always happy to comply with
the wishes of men who wear plain
clothes. Especially men who wear
plain clothes who have bulges in
their pockets.
Now, as I have stated, I had no
visions of walking side -by - side
with Harry, and discussing the state
of the Union and the folks back in
Independence. I just wanted to get
a glimpse of him. But more men in
plain clothes with bulges in their
pockets kept telling me to move
along, until finally I was a tele
scopic distance from Blair House.
Shrewdly, I circled back and got
in the house across the street from
Blair House and watched the en
trance. To make a long, sad story
a short, sad story, Mr. President
never took his constitutional. And
all I did for two and a half hours
was watch men in plain clothes pa
trol back and forth in front of Blair
House.
With bulges in their pockets.
A WALK WITH HAKRY
WASHINGTON, D.C.—I got up at
5 o'clock this morning to take my
morning walk. This I never do un
less it's to take a walk with the
President of the United States.
It's a known fact that robust
Harry Truman takes a walk around
the park between 6 and 6:30 a.m.
' Lilo' gave it a write-up once. This
is why I got up at 5 a.m. I wanted
to give the Chief Executive's con
