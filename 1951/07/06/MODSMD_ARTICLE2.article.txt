# Studentsâ€™ Draft Status Clarified
## 
### 
Local boards still have the say
when it comes to deferring college
students, according to the draft law j
passed by Congress early in June. |
A bulletin from the American |
Council on Education, which clari- |
fied the draft legislation, said the \
tests and class standings of stu- '
dents may be used by boards as a
guide or criterion for measuring j
student deferment.
According to the law, students
once postponed until the end oi
their academic year (not the uni- J
versity's academic year) may not j
be deferred on that basis again. j
However, according to the ACE
clarification, students once post
poned may still obtain deferment on
the basis of class standing or test
results.
Other features of the law are: ac- |
tive duty for inductees is extended
to 24 months; induction age is low
ered to 18Vi, provided all men be
tween 19 and 25 are inducted first; j
extension of Selective Service until [
July 1, 1955; provision for induct- I
ing married men without depend- I
ents other than wives, except in j
cases of extreme hardship; and '
mandatory deferment of high school :
students until they graduate or j
reach their 20th birthday, which- j
ever is earlier.
