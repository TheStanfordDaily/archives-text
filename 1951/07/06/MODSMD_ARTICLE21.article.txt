I hope it isn't a bad omen, but
Will Taylor, Stanford's senior of
fensive end, is not going to play this
coming grid year because of an in
jured foot incurred last season,
which still bothers him.

Loss Not Serious

Taylor, a good trackman, cannot
be blamed for wanting to keep his

legs in the best
possible shape,
as he has a fine
track future
ahead of him,
including a shot
at the Olympics.
And his loss
may not be se
rious. because
there are good
ends to replace

him, such as Bill McColl, Bill Sto
rii in, and Jack Rye, all hack from
(ast year's varsity. The frush send
lip John Steinberg and Sam Mot -
ley. Doutf Pinto comes up from
the JV's. A 1 Kirkland is a trans
fer from L.A. and Don Carlson,
a big basketballer with high
school football experience.
What I mean by a bad omen is
-his. It was only four yeaTs ago, in
the early summer of 1947, that Card
u;rid enthusiasts were buzzing about
a possible Rose Bowl team the fol
lowing fall. And they had reason
for such talk, because coming back
would be a veteran varsity, one that
chalked up six wins in 1946, Stan-
first year of athletic compe
tition following the war.
Disaster Strikes
Then disaster befell. Two ends,
Dave DeSwarte and Jack Eller, both
met tragic deaths. When fall prac
tice started, injury after injury
; \nxed the Marchie Schwartz team,
and a team destined to go places
went places all right, but the wrong
way, for they ended in the Con
ference basement with nine losses
and no wins.
The straw that broke the Indians'
back was a heartbreaking loss to a
Cal team which was favored ten to
one, but â€¢ only snaiehed victory in
the last three minutes on a prayer
pass. Now in the Cellar is a plaque
dedicated to that team, which says
in effect: "Nine times out. nine
times defeated, but they did not
lose the will to win. That is the
Stanford spirit."
I have everything that I own
crossed that Will's wise decision to
chop football is not the start of
another Stanford jinx team.
