# Four Alumni Play Pro Ball
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Let's take a look at Stanford's
| alumni now playing professional
I baseball.
Stanford's two representatives in
the big leagues aren't faring so well
j this year. Bobby Brown, who at
' tended school here during the war,
is currently battling with the spec
! tacular Gil McDougall for the start
ing third-base position on the world
| champion New York Yankees.
Brown's meager .235 average isn't
helping him in the struggle. How
ever, he has been hitting a long ball
with four home runs in 120 trips to
the plate.
Brown has been a mainstay dur
ing his four-year tenure with the
i Bombers. He has hit the ball St a
.288 clip and has continually come
through in the clutch. In three
World Series, he has sticked well
over .400.
It the diamond wars ever become
too harrowing, Brown can always
turn to medicine, as he became a
full-fledged doctor last year.
Lloyd Merriman. who gave up an
All-America future in football at
I Stanford to play ball for the Cin-
I cinnati Reds, is also having a rather
| pooi - seasfln. His average is hover
j ing around the .230 mark, but he
is seeing fairly frequent action with
! the light-hitting Reds. Merriman's
redeeming feature is his tremen
dous speed and hustle. The Cincin
nati fans have dubbed him "Cita
tion" after the famed race horse.
The saddest record of any ex-
Indian is that belonging to Dave

Dahle, star pitcher of the 1948-49
team. Dahle has alternated his time
between Oakland and Wenatchee
since turning pro. He has done yeo
man's duty with Wenatchee. but
has found the going rough with the
triple-A Oakland club. This year
he lias lost his only two decisions
with the Oaks, and Mel Ott is de
veloping him into a relief pitcher.
Jack Heincn is the most recent
grad to play ball for a living. Hei
nen had an unimpressive record
here last year but the San Jose Red
Sox evidently liked his size and
speed for they signed him up. Hei
nen has become the ace of a good
staff. He has won nine while losing
th ree. He has whiffed 90 men in
his 130 innings on the mound. He
could win 20 games for the so-so
Sox as he is pitching every fourth
day.
