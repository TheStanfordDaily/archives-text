# Peru Indians Pose Problem
## 
### 
Professor C. Langdon White, ad
dressing the last Tuesday Evening
Lecture Series audience on the Pe
ruvian Sierra, climaxed his infor
mative talk by asking the question,
"Will the Peruvian Indian problem
be settled by evolution or revolu
tion?"
Peril is still ruled lÂ»v the spirit
of conquest. Professor White said,
and until the white people of that
country try and settle the prob
lem. there can be no real stabil
ity in Peru.
The Indians, with their impres
sive Incan heritage, live in squa
lor and poverty hard for an
American to imagine. Their mode
of living and working is still back
in the style of the sixteenth cen
tury. They use the foot-plow to
cultivate their over-worked fields,
having nnt even access to the
primitive ox. This is why Pro
fessor White titled his lecture
"Out of 'Ibis World."
Since these Indians are the only
humans who can do any labor in
the Peruvian Sierras, because of
the tremendous altitudes, and since
no machine can replace the Indians'
work in the Peruvian copper mines,
Professor White pointed out the
.importance for the Peruvian gov
ernment to "recognize the hand
writing on the wall" and do some
thing to solve the growing Indian
problem in that country.
