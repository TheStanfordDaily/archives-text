# Behrman's 'Biography' Fresh as 1932 Opening
## 
### KEN WATERS 
The Stanford Players opened their summer season last Wednes
day evening with S. N. Behrman's "Biography." Playing before a
receptive audience, the troupe, headed by Lois Moran and John
Dodds, proved that Mr. Behrman's play had just as much fresh
ness and fun in it as it did when first presented in 1932.

F. Cowles Strickland, who direct
ed this production, proved his capa
bilities with a well - balanced and
finely cast production. Miss Moran
was gay, charming, and witty as she
pranced through the role of Marion
Froude, the Tennessee girl turned
Bohemian portrait painter.
She has a knack of timing and
expression that usually drains the
final chuckle or guffaw from Mr.
Behrman's most animated lines.
However, at times, Miss Moran
gave a rather studied and "ready"
delivery of some of her lines. Per
haps this was due to what might be
called the "first-night jeemies," or
perhaps she was not as familiar
with the lines as she should have
been.
Mr. Dodds' portrayal of Leander
"Bunny" Nolan was properly stiff
and stuffed, with that degree of in
genuousness called for by the role.
On the whole, his performance was
entirely acceptable and most en
joyable.
The most outstanding perform
ance in the production was giveu
by David Kaplan in the role of Mel
chior Feydak.
His performance as the Viennese
composer was itself worth the price
of admission. His poise, wit, and
understanding of the character were
evident from his first entrance to
his last exit.
In the role of the young radical,
fanatical, and somewhat adolescent
"Dickie" Kurt, Richard Cox gave a
fiery, and at times, a properly pa
thetic performance.
Thought still somewhat ill at ease
on the stage, and perhaps a little
young for the role, Mr. Cox gave
the finest performance we have
seen him give this year, and, from
the comments expressed by some of
the audience after the show, he be
came as real and as interesting to
them as he had on the stage to
Miss Froude.
Lawrence Strawbridge, playing
the role ol the Hollywood actor,
Warwick Wilson, was a convincing
matinee idol. Fred Forsman ap
peared at his comic best in the role
of Orrin Kinnicott, the newspaper
publisher who counted among his
many virtues the fact that he hadn't
changed his ideas in 20 years.
Jo Gilberg, as Slade Kinnicott,
gave the proper dash and spirit to
her role as the daughter of the
wealthy newspaper magnate; and
Celeste Ashley, though on stage
very little, gave a delightful charac
terization of Minnie, Marion's Ger
man maid.
LeGrand s setting, Brummer's
lighting, and Miss Opsvig's cos
tumes were quite suitable -to the
play. However, the set was too tall
for such an intimate play produced
in so small a place as the Little
Theater.
Taking the play as a whole, it
provides a very enjoyable and stim
ulating evening, well worth the
$1.20 admission price.
Tickets are available today and
from Monday through Friday of
next week at the Memorial Audi
torium box office.
The play runs nightly through
July 14, except for Sunday. Cur
tain time is 8:15 except for next
Tuesday's performance, which be
gins ;/t 9.

expression that usually drains the
final chuckle or guffaw from Mr.
Behrman's most animated lines.
However, at times, Miss Moran
gave a rather studied and "ready"
delivery of some of her lines. Per
haps this was due to what might be
called the "first-night jeemies," or
perhaps she was not as familiar
with the lines as she should have
been.
Mr. Dodds' portrayal of Leander
"Bunny" Nolan was properly stiff
and stuffed, with that degree of in
genuousness called for by the role.
On the whole, his performance was
entirely acceptable and most en
joyable.
The most outstanding perform
ance in the production was giveu
by David Kaplan in the role of Mel
chior Feydak.
His performance as the Viennese
composer was itself worth the price
of admission. His poise, wit, and
understanding of the character were
evident from his first entrance to
his last exit.
In the role of the young radical,
fanatical, and somewhat adolescent
"Dickie" Kurt, Richard Cox gave a
fiery, and at times, a properly pa
thetic performance.
Thought still somewhat ill at ease
on the stage, and perhaps a little
young for the role, Mr. Cox gave
the finest performance we have
seen him give this year, and, from
the comments expressed by some of
the audience after the show, he be
came as real and as interesting to
them as he had on the stage to
Miss Froude.
Lawrence Strawbridge, playing
the role ol the Hollywood actor,
Warwick Wilson, was a convincing
matinee idol. Fred Forsman ap
peared at his comic best in the role
of Orrin Kinnicott, the newspaper
publisher who counted among his
many virtues the fact that he hadn't
changed his ideas in 20 years.
Jo Gilberg, as Slade Kinnicott,
gave the proper dash and spirit to
her role as the daughter of the
wealthy newspaper magnate; and
Celeste Ashley, though on stage
very little, gave a delightful charac
terization of Minnie, Marion's Ger
man maid.
LeGrand s setting, Brummer's
lighting, and Miss Opsvig's cos
tumes were quite suitable -to the
play. However, the set was too tall
for such an intimate play produced
in so small a place as the Little
Theater.
Taking the play as a whole, it
provides a very enjoyable and stim
ulating evening, well worth the
$1.20 admission price.
Tickets are available today and
from Monday through Friday of
next week at the Memorial Audi
torium box office.
The play runs nightly through
July 14, except for Sunday. Cur
tain time is 8:15 except for next
Tuesday's performance, which be
gins ;/t 9.
The Stanford Players opened their summer season last Wednes
day evening with S. N. Behrman's "Biography." Playing before a
receptive audience, the troupe, headed by Lois Moran and John
Dodds, proved that Mr. Behrman's play had just as much fresh
ness and fun in it as it did when first presented in 1932.

F. Cowles Strickland, who direct
ed this production, proved his capa
bilities with a well - balanced and
finely cast production. Miss Moran
was gay, charming, and witty as she
pranced through the role of Marion
Froude, the Tennessee girl turned
Bohemian portrait painter.
She has a knack of timing and
expression that usually drains the
final chuckle or guffaw from Mr.
Behrman's most animated lines.
