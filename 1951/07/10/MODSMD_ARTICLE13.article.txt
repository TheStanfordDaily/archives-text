# Radio Institute in 9th Indian Summer

### LARRY CAHN 
Webster, that man of many
words, defines radio as the trans
mission and reception of signals by
j means of electric waves without a
[ connecting wire. The popular defi
j nition of television is "seeing at a
j distance."
However, the 51 students cur
, rently enrolled in the ninth annual
Stanford-NBC Radio Television In
! stitute are beginning to get an idea
i that adequate definitions of radio
; and television might possibly go
just a little deeper. In fact they are
j getting a notion that radio and TV
are complicated fields made up of
i many components, most of which
are now under study.
Thirteen courses are offered in
[ the Institute, ranging all the way
i from Television Workshop to Music
'in Radio. A required course is
"Broadcasting in the United States,"
in which the Institute has guest lec
turers from the allied industries.

Following the axiom that action
is better than words, all students
combine work and pleasure in op
erating KZSU, on the air from 7 to
11 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Tuesdays and Thursdays are
spent in San Francisco at radio sta
tion KNBC, the Bay Area NBC out
let, and television station KRON.
At these sessions actual studio work
is alternated with lectures by top
men in the two fields.
The faculty consists of staff mem
bers from NBC and members of the
regular Stanford faculty.
Dr. Stanley Donner, director of
radio at Stanford, is in charge of
the Institute. Dr. Donner sums up
the Institute's purpose as follows:
"The Institute hopes to Rive people
a background in practical training
in the importance of radio broad
casting, and at the same time de
velop new courses in the field of
television."
He adds, "This particular Insti

tute group appears to have a higher
level of maturity and experience
than any previous Institute at
Stanford."
In studying the enrollment sta
tisitcs available, the caliber of the
students may be established by the
fact that 22 are college graduates
while 13 are actually employed in
either radio or TV.
The interest stimulated by the In
stitute cannot be denied. Twenty
nine students are at the Institute
who are not or have not been Stan
ford students. They have come from
far and wide.
Whether their home be in Japan,
Ohio, Kansas, Oregon, or Califor
nia, and whether they are profes
sionals, teachers, or students, and
whatever their reason for coming, it
essentially boils down to one fun
damental: they are ambitious to
improve themselves so they may
improve their work
