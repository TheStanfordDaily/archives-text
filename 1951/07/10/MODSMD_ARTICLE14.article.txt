### 
Peru's Ambassador to the
United States, Fernando Bercke
meyer, will discuss "Modern.
Peru and Its Development" at
the Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture in Memorial Hall tonight.
The Ambassador will he intro
duced at 8 p.m. by Paul C. Ed
wards, chairman of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees. The
lecture will be open to the public
without charge.
Formerly Peruvian consul gen
eral in San Francisco and New
York, Ambassador Berckemeyer has
been a member of his country's
diplomatic service since 192G. He
was minister to Great Britain from
1942 to 1945, took the ministerial
post in Sweden in 1946, and then
returned to England as Peru's first
ambassador there. He received his
present post in Washington in 1949.
Last Tuesday the ambassador
attended a Iccture about his na
tive country, the first in a series
arranged for the summer Tues
day Evening Series at Stanford by
the Hispanic - American Institute,
and heard Professor C. Langdon
White give a personal report on
Peru's use of American technical
aid under the Point Four pro
gram.
In Professor White's view, mil
lions of Indians in Peru, center oÂ£
the ancient Inca empire, are barely
able to exist on their land's low
agricultural yield. Such conditions
prohibit economic and political sta
bility in Peru, according to Dr.
i White, because the Indians make up
| 80 per cent of the country's popu
j lation.
Ambassador Berckemeyer ex
plains the difficulty of the Indian
! problem. The Indians are accus
tomed to their traditional ways of
l farming, even if they are not the
most effetive, and it is hard to
persuade them to change these
: methods.
But he points out the great strides
his government has made in Pe
ruvian social, educational, and eco
nomic betterment. His lecture to
night is expected to enlarge upon
both the problems his country faces
and the methods his government
has adopted to solve them.
