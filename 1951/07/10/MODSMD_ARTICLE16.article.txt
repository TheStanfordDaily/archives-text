* Griff and I had never been to
Washington before this week. To
both of us, the capital city had
merejy been an inanimate and
prominent spot on the map of the
United States, a city from which
came much of the irritating news
of the day, and the location of the
residence of Harry Truman.
But now, after only a few days'
Stay, Washington, D.C., has become
something alive, something real. We
have found that it is a city of living
people, a city of beauty and sig
nificance, a city where that all-im
portant, bread - giving idol of the J
representatives of our population,
the vote,* is held in continual regard
by the men on Capitol Hill.
One of those men, Congressman
Jack Anderson, received a visit
from two of his constituents on the
fust day of our stay. On first greet
in;-; us, he was friendly and helpful. !
On hearing that I was on the statt 1
of The Daily, he was exceedingly j
friendly and helpful.
He invited us into his private of
fice, showered us with passes to
sessions of Congress and committee
meetings, showed us his family al
bum, and then excused himself to >
"take care of the tremendous
amount of work which pours into
this office." -We didn't tell him we
were not of voting age.
But the passes which Congress
man Anderson gave us did open the I
door to a fascinating experience, j
Ti e next few days we watched the :
men of our government at work, on j
the floor of the Senate and the j
House of Representatives, in com- !
mittee rooms, and in the lobbies of
hotels.

We saw intelligent and well-spo
j ken men of government like Dean
Acheson and George Marshall tes
tifying before the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs. And we saw
loud-mouthed men like Congress
man Rankin and Senator McCarthy
on the Hoor of the House and the
Senate.
Through the words and actions of
| our Congress we could see the sig
i nificance of the city of Washington.
The significance of Washington,
j D.C., goes beyond and behind the
present, && a city, Washington is
significant from the historical angle.
Standing before the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitu
tion in the Library of Congress,
viewing the steps of the Capitol
building where Presidents have
been inaugurated for over a hun
-1 dred years, and seeing the dozens
!of spots mentioned in American
j history books, the visitor to Wash
j ington will become aware that this
city has seen and taken the greatest
part in the formation and preserva
tion of a nation.
And as the visitor sees the hun
dred and one foreign diplomats and
government officials making their
way between the offices of Capitol
Hill, he is aware that Washington
is seeing and taking the greatest
part in the formation of a world
I nation.
There is little else I might say in
[ such a generalized account of our
j capital city. .Only that its climate
|is hot and humid. But even the
I heat and the humidity have been
erased by the men who work and
; live here. Air conditioning.

have found that it is a city of living
people, a city of beauty and sig
nificance, a city where that all-im
portant, bread - giving idol of the J
representatives of our population,
the vote,* is held in continual regard
by the men on Capitol Hill.
One of those men, Congressman
Jack Anderson, received a visit
from two of his constituents on the
fust day of our stay. On first greet
in;-; us, he was friendly and helpful. !
On hearing that I was on the statt 1
of The Daily, he was exceedingly j
friendly and helpful.
He invited us into his private of
fice, showered us with passes to
sessions of Congress and committee
meetings, showed us his family al
bum, and then excused himself to >
"take care of the tremendous
amount of work which pours into
this office." -We didn't tell him we
were not of voting age.
But the passes which Congress
man Anderson gave us did open the I
door to a fascinating experience, j
Ti e next few days we watched the :
men of our government at work, on j
the floor of the Senate and the j
House of Representatives, in com- !
mittee rooms, and in the lobbies of
hotels.

We saw intelligent and well-spo
j ken men of government like Dean
Acheson and George Marshall tes
tifying before the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs. And we saw
loud-mouthed men like Congress
man Rankin and Senator McCarthy
on the Hoor of the House and the
Senate.
Through the words and actions of
| our Congress we could see the sig
i nificance of the city of Washington.
The significance of Washington,
j D.C., goes beyond and behind the
present, && a city, Washington is
significant from the historical angle.
Standing before the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitu
tion in the Library of Congress,
viewing the steps of the Capitol
building where Presidents have
been inaugurated for over a hun
-1 dred years, and seeing the dozens
!of spots mentioned in American
j history books, the visitor to Wash
j ington will become aware that this
city has seen and taken the greatest
part in the formation and preserva
tion of a nation.
And as the visitor sees the hun
dred and one foreign diplomats and
government officials making their
way between the offices of Capitol
Hill, he is aware that Washington
is seeing and taking the greatest
part in the formation of a world
I nation.
There is little else I might say in
[ such a generalized account of our
j capital city. .Only that its climate
|is hot and humid. But even the
I heat and the humidity have been
erased by the men who work and
; live here. Air conditioning.
* Griff and I had never been to
Washington before this week. To
both of us, the capital city had
merejy been an inanimate and
prominent spot on the map of the
United States, a city from which
came much of the irritating news
of the day, and the location of the
residence of Harry Truman.
But now, after only a few days'
Stay, Washington, D.C., has become
something alive, something real. We
have found that it is a city of living
people, a city of beauty and sig
nificance, a city where that all-im
