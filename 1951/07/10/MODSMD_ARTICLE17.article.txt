# Little Theater Group Proves Competent in Fry's "Phoenix'
## 
### JOHN BUSH AND DICK FREDELL 
Now, here is one you should put j
down on your calendar in india ink,
with underlines, and for two rea- j
sons. At tlie Palo Alto Community
Theater this Friday and Saturday, J
the Interplayers of San Francisco
'are going to put 011 Christopher
Fry's "A Phoenix Too Frequent."
Reason one: "Phoenix" is a very J
fine sort of play, and it is executed
with a perfectly reasonable degree
of skill.
Reason two: If you take any sig- j
nificant amount of interest in the
theater, and particularly the art ;
theater, so called, you can hardly |
afford to pass up an introduction to
the Interplayers. This company is j
one of the finest "little theater" I
groups in the country, judging from 1
the consensus of those who keep I
close tabs on the little theaters.
' Phoenix" is based on Gaius Pe- j
tronius' classic tale, "The Matron of
Ephesus." The story deals with a ;
young widow and her woman-serv- j
ant who have taken it upon them- !
.selves to die a-mourning in the
tomb of Virilius, the dearly de
parted.
Their plan, however, meets frus
tration in the person of Tegeus-
Chromis, a soldier whose curiosity
le; ds him to enter the tomb. He
succeeds in getting Mrs. Virilius, or j
Dynamene, and her maidservant, j
Doto, into a perfectly charming,
.state of drunkenness. He proceeds j
from there.
The story ends with a grotesque
twist which takes the action—here
tofore chiefly diction — and makes!
drama out of it. (See Stegner for a
technical explanation of this one.)
Mary Ellen Ray does a compe
tent job with the role of Dynamene, I

though she shows a good deal more j
talent than experience. Jane Steckle
j as Doto makes us thoroughly aware ,
that we are seeing comedy, in this j
' case meaning that which is comic. 1
Unfortunately, Jack Denbo as Te
geus-Chromis has failed to grasp
the essence of his role—he reads!
his lines in a rather pedestrian fash-
I ion, with too much old-style ro
mance and not at all enough in
sightful cynicism.
Joyce Lancaster's direction is, as
a matter of fact, quite good.
As a little theater group, the In- |
terplayers ought to be seen. Their
I repertory is made up of works that 1
lack a mass appeal and yet very J
much deserve to be played; and
I furthermore, the acting, staging,
! and direction are unusually compe
tent for a group of this sort.
Tickets are 90 cents, unless you
: have a season ticket to the Penin- 1
sula Community Theater Festival.

the consensus of those who keep I
close tabs on the little theaters.
' Phoenix" is based on Gaius Pe- j
tronius' classic tale, "The Matron of
Ephesus." The story deals with a ;
young widow and her woman-serv- j
ant who have taken it upon them- !
.selves to die a-mourning in the
tomb of Virilius, the dearly de
parted.
Their plan, however, meets frus
tration in the person of Tegeus-
Chromis, a soldier whose curiosity
le; ds him to enter the tomb. He
succeeds in getting Mrs. Virilius, or j
Dynamene, and her maidservant, j
Doto, into a perfectly charming,
.state of drunkenness. He proceeds j
from there.
The story ends with a grotesque
twist which takes the action—here
tofore chiefly diction — and makes!
drama out of it. (See Stegner for a
technical explanation of this one.)
Mary Ellen Ray does a compe
tent job with the role of Dynamene, I

though she shows a good deal more j
talent than experience. Jane Steckle
j as Doto makes us thoroughly aware ,
that we are seeing comedy, in this j
' case meaning that which is comic. 1
Unfortunately, Jack Denbo as Te
geus-Chromis has failed to grasp
the essence of his role—he reads!
his lines in a rather pedestrian fash-
I ion, with too much old-style ro
mance and not at all enough in
sightful cynicism.
Joyce Lancaster's direction is, as
a matter of fact, quite good.
As a little theater group, the In- |
terplayers ought to be seen. Their
I repertory is made up of works that 1
lack a mass appeal and yet very J
much deserve to be played; and
I furthermore, the acting, staging,
! and direction are unusually compe
tent for a group of this sort.
Tickets are 90 cents, unless you
: have a season ticket to the Penin- 1
sula Community Theater Festival.

with a perfectly reasonable degree
