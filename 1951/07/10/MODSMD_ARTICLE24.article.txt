Alter looking at Stanford's football schedule for the coming campaign,
I am not so sure that the NCAA ban on television is not a good thing, at
least from Stanford's point of view.
Home Grid Sked Lacks Attractions
The caliber of the visiting teams in the Stadium, with the exception
ol California and possibly UCLA, will be oi such degree that the huge
oval will not be filled to one-fourth its capacity on any given Saturday.
All games ol any attraction are on the road: Oregon at Portland, Michigan
at Ann Arbor. Washington at Seattle, and USC in the Coliseum.
If there were telecasts ol the home games, the attendance would be
even lower, because even enthusiasts have a tendency to stay home and
watch a tilt on TV when a conflict such as traffic, weather, or other en
gagements arises.
But now, with the NCAA and PCC banning member schools from tele- I
vising games, except for experimental purposes, individuals who want to
see Stanford play for one reason or another, or wish to see football, must
be in attendance at the game ifsell. With Stanford's poor schedule this
ban might be a lilesaver, for who would drive thirty miles from San Fran
cisco to see such teams as San Jose State, Santa Clara, Washington State,
and Oregon State perform, unless these schools come up with surprise
ball clubs?
IV iii 1950 l)i<l Hurt Attendance
Stanford did televise all home games last season, and it did hurt gate
receipts to the tune of a 31.4.per cent attendance drop over 1949. At the
USC. Washington, and Washington State games substantial drops were
noted.
A quote by Don Liebendorfer, Stanford's Director of Publicity, last
tall in the height of the TV controversy seems very applicable now. He
said then. "Stanford has always been 100 per cent for television. We were
the first school on the Coast to assume a full home-game television sched
ule,. and it is our sincerest desire to bring our games into the homes of
alumni, shut-ins, and friends." But, he adds, "We can only continue to
televise the games as long as it doesn't cut our life line" (gate receipts).
It is the revenue from football that keeps all other athletics going.
In the light of this I believe the national ban saved Stanford the em
barrassment", controversy, and public ill feeling of stopping televising on
her own. Certainly if the attendance drop last year did not warrant Stan
ford dropping TV, I am sure that if televising was carried through this !
season of mediocre contests, Stanford, on her own. would be forced to step i
in to preserve her "life line."
The ban has caused great displeasure among televiewers, who had an- !
ticipated a full fall of gridiron action right in their living rooms. But I
can't believe that the universities throughout the country affected by the
ban are at all sorry, although for reasons of public relations they might
give the opposite impression. Stanford's Director of Athletics, A 1 Masters,
says this:
"In principle, we disagree with the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation's experimental program on television. We are going along with
the moratorium, whereby we will not sell our television rights except
for special experimental games—but we still disagree in principle.
"I don't mind saying the (M) per cent asked by the NCAA for experi
mental purposes is too much—much too much. Suppose we simply gave
away the Big Game for television? What's <»0 per cent of naught?"
