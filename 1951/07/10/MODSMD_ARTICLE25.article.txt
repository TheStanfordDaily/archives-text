Bobby White, stellar offensive i
and defensive Stanford halfback, 1
I has been signed to play with the
San Francisco Forty-Joiners, pro
; fessionul football squad.
White, who won three letters j
while playing under Marchie
Schwartz, averaged better than five J
yards per carry in his college ca-
I reer.
However, last season the five- !

| professional conference, such as
Frankie Albert, Norm Standlee,
Bruno Banducci, and others.
Another Bay Area collegian to
join the Forty - Niners is Santa j

at fullback for the Broncos in sea- j
sons past. He was named on the I
honorable All-American.
