# Bloodmobile To Arrive In Palo Alto
## 
### 
Students can make appoint
ments tomorrow and Thursday
at the registration table in front
of the Cellar to give blood when
the mobile blood unit visits Palo
Alto Community Center on July
18.
The mobile unit is from the Pied
Cross Regional Blood Center in San |
Jose, and will be at the Community â€¢
Center from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Appointments can be made for I
any time during the day, and trans- j
portation will be arranged for those
who need it. Giving blood usually
takes no longer than 45 minutes.
Anyone between 18 and 60 in
good health and weighing more
than 110 pounds is eligible to give
blood. Those under 21 are required
to turn in signed parental release
slips when the appointment is
made.
Officials of the Palo Alto Red
Cross chapter emphasized that de
spite "cease fire" discussions in Ko
rea, military requests for blood
have not been reduced. The actual
end of fighting is still problematical,
and casualties of many months ago
still require transfusions to carry
them through major surgery. For
these reasons, blood is needed as
much as ever.
The sign-up tables will be staffed
under the chairmanship of Bob
Swetzer.
When the bloodmobile came to
the campus in January and April
on special runs, the daily quota
of 200 pints was exceeded with a
total from both visits of 438.
