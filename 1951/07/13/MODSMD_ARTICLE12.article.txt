# The 						Tragic Hunt'—A Bit of Italian Realism
## 
### JOHN BUSH AND DICK FREDELL 
At the Peninsula Film' Society
Sunday night: Giuseppe de Santis'
profound and liard - hitting "The
Tragic Hunt."
The film stars Vivi Gioi, who
portrafs a kidnaper - collaboration
ist. She handles the role with
rarely matched technique and un
derstanding. "Traiiic Hunt" is of

the *'neo - realist" school that is
largely responsible for Italy's post
war reputation in the cinema world.
The plot and the direction make
it perfectly clear that this neo-reul
ist school can display a novel and
moving sense of the dynamics of
drama. And de Santis' years of
study and work at the Centro Speri
mentale are put to work—in most
cases effectively — in the use of a
number of tehniques usually found

only in the experimental films.
The situation is a violent one al
most throughout: the suspense
mounts as a spring tightens upon
itself—and with a minimum of re
lief. Perhaps the telling thing is
that it does not fall of its own
weight. But it does not—and that is
: a real trick, indeed.
Shorter films will open the 8
o'clock program at the Palo Alto
Community Center.
