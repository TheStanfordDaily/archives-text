# Smoking in the Libe Lobby
## 
### 
For the first time in the history of Stanford, smokers may puff
away contentedly in the library lobby, and still be on the right
side of the law. This action was taken by Excom Wednesday
night, and has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Allowing students to smoke in the library is in many ways a
trial balloon, and Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler said it is
up to the students to see that the action gets a fair trial.
Students can give it a fair trial by keeping noise in the lobby
at a minimum, so as not to disturb students at study, and by dis
posings of butts in the proper receptacles.
Student government and the University administration have
done their part; the rest is up to the students.
Frcm time to time complaints have cropped up concerning noise
in the lobby during the evening hours. Even though smokers may
not have in the past and do not in the future contribute to this
distracting library environment, any continuation of the noise
will jeopardize the success of the trial balloon.
The administration and Excom are to be congratulated on this
latest attempt to make life on the Farm more pleasant for all con
cerned. The Daily hopes the attempt is justified by a manifesta
tion of appreciation on the part of the recipients.
