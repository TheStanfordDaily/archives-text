This article is written for Bulls only. From time to time we like to
come to the aid of our fellow male sufferers who are having diffi
culties with women. We shall title this session "What Every
Young Man Should Know."
Actually it's a few quotations about women that every guy
wishes he had thought of. It's all done in the spirit of fun, but
members of the fair sex are not advised to read further.
Our research in this matter proves conclusively one thing:
Down through the centuries man has been fooled, fouled, and
—worst of all—foiled by that necessary evil which goes
variously by the name of skirt, dame, maid, chick, Stanford
woman, and so on.
One thing that is most regrettable is that in the case of woman,
man fails to learn from his mistakes in the past. The same female
quirks that tormented such a stalwart as Marc Anthony, still drive
modern man to distraction.
Men, let us unite and take heed of our past folly and profit
thereby. To wit we present a few quotations of the masters which
reflect the utter despair which man sometimes experiences.
That wise old Englishman Thomas More seemed to have the
"word" way back in the 18th Century when he wrote:
"My only books were women's looks.
And tolly's all they taught me."
This seems to be an interesting process of learning. The old boy
evidently didn't know that you should not judge a book by its
cover.
Going back to the Middle Ages we find this woeful statement
attributed to Francois Villon:
"Blonde or brunette this rhyme applies,
Happy is he who knows them not."
So you see, men (for I trust no fai* lady has dared to venture
this far), even in those days there was no surplus of complaisant
women.
This brings us to the venerable Earl of Chesterfield. Some say
he really knew his ABC's (not a plug) when he wrote:
"Women are to be talked to as below men and above
children."
Another fellow sufferer and complainer of the past, George
Granville, once offered this pearl of wisdom:
"Who to a woman trusts his peace of mind.
Trusts a frail bark in a tempestuous wind."
If this fragment of sage advice sets you to wondering, then lend
an ear to Samuel Johnson:
"I am very fond of the company of ladies. I like their
beauty. 1 like their delicacy, I like their vivacity, and I like
their silence."
We leave you with this thought for today:
"Between a woman's yes and no. there is not room for a
pin to go."
