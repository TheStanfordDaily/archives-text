## Time Out 
### 
Last Tuesday the Daily sports editor gave yo\i the "Cahn" side of this
college football—television hassle. Now let an old "Pro" take over for a little
different slant on the thing. Like the man said when he saw Jane Russell in
« bathing suit, there are some interesting points that are too often overlooked.
To start off with, the NCAA admits that their proposed limitation of game
telecasts is sort of an experiment. Attendance was down all around last
year. And a lot of TV sets were hustled during the summer and fall. So
the NCAA put two and two together—and their answer painted a black
moustache on television and made it the villian of the piece.
But they don't have to play trial-and-error to find out if keeping the first
downs out of the living room is going to wear out the turnstiles. The Pacific
Coast League has already put the whole thing through a test tube. All the
NCAA has to do is pick up the pieces.
The PCL Played Santa (Jans in 3950
Last year the PCL started out like everyday was Christmas. Each club
that was close enough to a major television broadcasting station hitched up
the reindeer and gave everybody from a 7 inch Motorola to a 19 inch Zenith
Si ixee ride.
Then the reindeer got tired pulling all by themselves, and the club owners
asked everybody to get out and push a little. Just buy a pair of tickets, they
said, or even just one. But instead of going out to the ball game, everybody
just turned on Dagmar.
So what happens? The club owners tie the can on television. This year
four PCL teams put on a telechastity-belt and throw away the key. The
Seals and the Oaks decide to keep their proceedings private (thereby de
priving local vido connoisseurs of some of their best comic fare) then fudge
a little and pick up the check once a week. Hollywood cuts down, giving
their patrons a free peek just twice a week. And only the Los Angeles club
continues to come on like a stripper in a sideshow—they're showing every
thing.
The result of all this fuss Ls that attendance is down over 20 per cent from
last year. And if college football divides 10 Saturdays by four telecasts, they
might as well just copy the PCL's math paper. Because television isn't the
right answer.
Attendance Drop Is Normal
Look at it this way. The boys who want to ride television out of town
on a rail point to the fact that attendance at Stanford's home games was
down 31 per cent last year from 1049. The figure sounds impressive. But
if you look at it real close it means about as much as last year's valentines.
To begin with, you can knock off about half of that with a dull bread
knife, Stanford's home game attendance for the season is always about 15
per ce.it less every other year, when Big Game is at Berkeley. The rest of it?
Well, it adds up to a lot less than the PCL gate sag—and they're working
c»n the same partial television system the NCAA is nominating as Utopia.
Could be the fans are just easing off baseball and football tickets these
days, and using the piggy-bank for porkchops. And there just aren't enough
'butchers to fill all the ball parks.
And let's remember that TV is just naturally less apt to pick the pockets
of college football than to dig into the jeans of minor league baseball. The
guy with the program and the hot dog in his hand is going to get tired
shelling out for 178 baseball games a lot sooner than he's going to get blaze
about 10 football games.
Take the Tar and Feathers OH TV
So what's the answer? Unfortunately there isn't one answer for every
body. The curve on this test is as out of shape as a Model A fender. Only
one or two guys can get the question right. Let's look at that PCL attendance
again.
If we charted it, the thing would look like a sawed-off ski-jump. Except
for two clubs. While everybody else is playing with only mother and the
kiddies in the stands, Seattle and Sacramento are showing a marked attend
ance increase. And, by a happy coincidence, Seattle and Sacramento are
the two clubs who have led the league all season.
All of which means that push-buttons and arm-chairs have a lot less to
do with attendance than the size of the numbers on the scoreboard. It's
almost as old as boy meets girl, and as true as a sinner's dying confession.
If you're going to lure that piggy-bank away from the porkchops. you've
got to bring home the bacon.
Indians May Smell Like Roses
That's why all this fuss about nobody watching the Cards next year
seems downright unpatriotic. We've got more reason to hope than the old
maid who heard a sneeze under the bed. Of course, it might just have been
a stray dog.
But even if the Big Red isn't a championship ball club, it'll be a novelty.
This is the year when the line may be stronger than the halfbacks. And talk
about horseless carriages that fly—the 1951 Red team will make a miracle
that hasn t been performed on the Farm since many calendars ago. Blocking,
that is.
With that Big Red line moving them out of the way. and those Indian
quarterbacks moving us all the way—well, Pasadena's lovely around New
Year's time. And if that happens, the Athletic Department will be working
.iate nights, counting their loot—with or without television.
It's just like I was telling Ava Gardner the other night—if you've got it
where it counts, there'll always be somebody who'll pay to see it in action.

about horseless carriages that fly—the 1951 Red team will make a miracle
that hasn t been performed on the Farm since many calendars ago. Blocking,
that is.
With that Big Red line moving them out of the way. and those Indian
quarterbacks moving us all the way—well, Pasadena's lovely around New
Year's time. And if that happens, the Athletic Department will be working
.iate nights, counting their loot—with or without television.
It's just like I was telling Ava Gardner the other night—if you've got it
where it counts, there'll always be somebody who'll pay to see it in action.

Last Tuesday the Daily sports editor gave yo\i the "Cahn" side of this
college football—television hassle. Now let an old "Pro" take over for a little
different slant on the thing. Like the man said when he saw Jane Russell in
« bathing suit, there are some interesting points that are too often overlooked.
To start off with, the NCAA admits that their proposed limitation of game
telecasts is sort of an experiment. Attendance was down all around last
year. And a lot of TV sets were hustled during the summer and fall. So
the NCAA put two and two together—and their answer painted a black
moustache on television and made it the villian of the piece.
But they don't have to play trial-and-error to find out if keeping the first
downs out of the living room is going to wear out the turnstiles. The Pacific
Coast League has already put the whole thing through a test tube. All the
NCAA has to do is pick up the pieces.
The PCL Played Santa (Jans in 3950
Last year the PCL started out like everyday was Christmas. Each club
that was close enough to a major television broadcasting station hitched up
the reindeer and gave everybody from a 7 inch Motorola to a 19 inch Zenith
Si ixee ride.
Then the reindeer got tired pulling all by themselves, and the club owners
asked everybody to get out and push a little. Just buy a pair of tickets, they
said, or even just one. But instead of going out to the ball game, everybody
just turned on Dagmar.
So what happens? The club owners tie the can on television. This year
four PCL teams put on a telechastity-belt and throw away the key. The
Seals and the Oaks decide to keep their proceedings private (thereby de
priving local vido connoisseurs of some of their best comic fare) then fudge
a little and pick up the check once a week. Hollywood cuts down, giving
their patrons a free peek just twice a week. And only the Los Angeles club
continues to come on like a stripper in a sideshow—they're showing every
thing.
The result of all this fuss Ls that attendance is down over 20 per cent from
last year. And if college football divides 10 Saturdays by four telecasts, they
might as well just copy the PCL's math paper. Because television isn't the
right answer.
Attendance Drop Is Normal
Look at it this way. The boys who want to ride television out of town
on a rail point to the fact that attendance at Stanford's home games was
down 31 per cent last year from 1049. The figure sounds impressive. But
if you look at it real close it means about as much as last year's valentines.
To begin with, you can knock off about half of that with a dull bread
knife, Stanford's home game attendance for the season is always about 15
per ce.it less every other year, when Big Game is at Berkeley. The rest of it?
Well, it adds up to a lot less than the PCL gate sag—and they're working
c»n the same partial television system the NCAA is nominating as Utopia.
Could be the fans are just easing off baseball and football tickets these
days, and using the piggy-bank for porkchops. And there just aren't enough
'butchers to fill all the ball parks.
And let's remember that TV is just naturally less apt to pick the pockets
of college football than to dig into the jeans of minor league baseball. The
guy with the program and the hot dog in his hand is going to get tired
shelling out for 178 baseball games a lot sooner than he's going to get blaze
about 10 football games.
Take the Tar and Feathers OH TV
So what's the answer? Unfortunately there isn't one answer for every
body. The curve on this test is as out of shape as a Model A fender. Only
one or two guys can get the question right. Let's look at that PCL attendance
again.
If we charted it, the thing would look like a sawed-off ski-jump. Except
for two clubs. While everybody else is playing with only mother and the
kiddies in the stands, Seattle and Sacramento are showing a marked attend
ance increase. And, by a happy coincidence, Seattle and Sacramento are
the two clubs who have led the league all season.
All of which means that push-buttons and arm-chairs have a lot less to
do with attendance than the size of the numbers on the scoreboard. It's
almost as old as boy meets girl, and as true as a sinner's dying confession.
If you're going to lure that piggy-bank away from the porkchops. you've
got to bring home the bacon.
Indians May Smell Like Roses
That's why all this fuss about nobody watching the Cards next year
seems downright unpatriotic. We've got more reason to hope than the old
maid who heard a sneeze under the bed. Of course, it might just have been
a stray dog.
But even if the Big Red isn't a championship ball club, it'll be a novelty.

do with attendance than the size of the numbers on the scoreboard. It's
almost as old as boy meets girl, and as true as a sinner's dying confession.
If you're going to lure that piggy-bank away from the porkchops. you've
got to bring home the bacon.
Indians May Smell Like Roses
That's why all this fuss about nobody watching the Cards next year
seems downright unpatriotic. We've got more reason to hope than the old
maid who heard a sneeze under the bed. Of course, it might just have been
a stray dog.
But even if the Big Red isn't a championship ball club, it'll be a novelty.
This is the year when the line may be stronger than the halfbacks. And talk
about horseless carriages that fly—the 1951 Red team will make a miracle
that hasn t been performed on the Farm since many calendars ago. Blocking,
that is.
With that Big Red line moving them out of the way. and those Indian
quarterbacks moving us all the way—well, Pasadena's lovely around New
Year's time. And if that happens, the Athletic Department will be working
.iate nights, counting their loot—with or without television.
It's just like I was telling Ava Gardner the other night—if you've got it
where it counts, there'll always be somebody who'll pay to see it in action.

Last Tuesday the Daily sports editor gave yo\i the "Cahn" side of this
college football—television hassle. Now let an old "Pro" take over for a little
different slant on the thing. Like the man said when he saw Jane Russell in
« bathing suit, there are some interesting points that are too often overlooked.
To start off with, the NCAA admits that their proposed limitation of game
telecasts is sort of an experiment. Attendance was down all around last
year. And a lot of TV sets were hustled during the summer and fall. So
the NCAA put two and two together—and their answer painted a black
moustache on television and made it the villian of the piece.
But they don't have to play trial-and-error to find out if keeping the first
downs out of the living room is going to wear out the turnstiles. The Pacific
Coast League has already put the whole thing through a test tube. All the
NCAA has to do is pick up the pieces.
The PCL Played Santa (Jans in 3950
Last year the PCL started out like everyday was Christmas. Each club
that was close enough to a major television broadcasting station hitched up
the reindeer and gave everybody from a 7 inch Motorola to a 19 inch Zenith
Si ixee ride.
Then the reindeer got tired pulling all by themselves, and the club owners
asked everybody to get out and push a little. Just buy a pair of tickets, they
said, or even just one. But instead of going out to the ball game, everybody
just turned on Dagmar.
So what happens? The club owners tie the can on television. This year
four PCL teams put on a telechastity-belt and throw away the key. The
Seals and the Oaks decide to keep their proceedings private (thereby de
priving local vido connoisseurs of some of their best comic fare) then fudge
a little and pick up the check once a week. Hollywood cuts down, giving
their patrons a free peek just twice a week. And only the Los Angeles club
continues to come on like a stripper in a sideshow—they're showing every
thing.
The result of all this fuss Ls that attendance is down over 20 per cent from
last year. And if college football divides 10 Saturdays by four telecasts, they
might as well just copy the PCL's math paper. Because television isn't the
right answer.
Attendance Drop Is Normal
Look at it this way. The boys who want to ride television out of town
on a rail point to the fact that attendance at Stanford's home games was
down 31 per cent last year from 1049. The figure sounds impressive. But
if you look at it real close it means about as much as last year's valentines.
To begin with, you can knock off about half of that with a dull bread
knife, Stanford's home game attendance for the season is always about 15
per ce.it less every other year, when Big Game is at Berkeley. The rest of it?
Well, it adds up to a lot less than the PCL gate sag—and they're working
c»n the same partial television system the NCAA is nominating as Utopia.
Could be the fans are just easing off baseball and football tickets these
days, and using the piggy-bank for porkchops. And there just aren't enough
'butchers to fill all the ball parks.
And let's remember that TV is just naturally less apt to pick the pockets
of college football than to dig into the jeans of minor league baseball. The
guy with the program and the hot dog in his hand is going to get tired
shelling out for 178 baseball games a lot sooner than he's going to get blaze
about 10 football games.
Take the Tar and Feathers OH TV
So what's the answer? Unfortunately there isn't one answer for every
body. The curve on this test is as out of shape as a Model A fender. Only
one or two guys can get the question right. Let's look at that PCL attendance
again.
If we charted it, the thing would look like a sawed-off ski-jump. Except
for two clubs. While everybody else is playing with only mother and the
kiddies in the stands, Seattle and Sacramento are showing a marked attend
ance increase. And, by a happy coincidence, Seattle and Sacramento are
the two clubs who have led the league all season.
All of which means that push-buttons and arm-chairs have a lot less to
do with attendance than the size of the numbers on the scoreboard. It's
almost as old as boy meets girl, and as true as a sinner's dying confession.
