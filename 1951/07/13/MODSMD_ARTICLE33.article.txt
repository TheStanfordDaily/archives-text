## No-Hit Job By Reynolds 
### United Press 
Big Allie Reynolds threw a no
hitter at Cleveland last night, as
the Yankees beat Bob Feller and
the Indians 1-0. Feller went into
; the sixth inning with a no-hitter of
his own before Mickey Mantle put
Reynolds in a class by himself by
j doubling off the Cleveland right
hander. But Feller's real Waterloo
came in the seventh, when he threw
a gopher ball that Gene Woodling
lost in the right field seats,
j In pitching the first no-hit, no
i run game of. his career, Reynolds
j struck out four and walked three.
| The Indians didn't have a base-run
ner after the fourth inning, as the
Cherokee right-hander retired the
last 17 men in order. And with two
j out in the ninth, and the Cleveland
fans screaming for a base-hit, Rey
nolds threw a third strike past Ro
berto Avila to go down in baseball
! history.

Reynolds was mobbed by his
teammates when Avila fanned, and
Berra did an ape-like dance of joy
all the way to the mound to hand
Reynolds the ball.
"It was not my best panic,'' Rey
nolds panted. "I thought my best
job was the 1-0 game in the 1949
World Sfcrics when I beat Don
Newcombe of the Dodgers."
'"I was throwing mostly fast
balls," Reynolds said, mopping a
profusely sweating brow. "1 had
trouble with my control at first, and
was a little worried, but I steadied."
"You were tine, just fine," Berra
chortled. "I was never worried."
The losing pitcher, Feller, beaten
only the third time this year, said
simply, "Reynolds had it tonight.
Ho pitched a mighty fine ball
game."
