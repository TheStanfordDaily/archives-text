# 39-17! That's Volleyball?
## 
### 
The off - campus Independents
clobbered a hapless Eucalypto nine
39-17 in the first round of the AWS
volleyball tournament Wednesday.
And before we go any farther, let's
explain that score.
The scorekeeper wasn't drunk,
and the Daily sports staff does know
the difference between a volleyball
and a muskmelon. But this girls'
volleyball follows the rules like
Micky Cohen fills out his income
tax return.
Instead of calling 15 points the
finish line and letting the two teams
race for it.the sexy slammers have
a new idea. They just set the alarm
clock for a half-hour and have at it.
At the sound of the gong, they all
rush over to the adding machine
(unless a calculus professor is keep
ing score) and then it's three cheers
and a tiger.
Play in this AWS round-robin
will continue next week, with the
Magnolia, Naranja, and Granada
teams trying to grab that top spot
from the Independent steamroller.
Daphne Gardner is in charge.
