A crew member of the racing
yacht L'Apache was rescued alive
f.nd apparently little the worse for
his experience today after spending
more than 30 hours adrift on a flim
sy life buoy in the mid-Paciflc.
Ted Sierks, 40. Catalina Island.
Calif., was picked up by the U.S.
Navy destroyer escort Douglas A.
Munro at a point roughly 830 miles
northeast of Honolulu. His rescue
came hours after yachtsmen par
ticipating in the 2,225-mile trans-
Pacific race to Honolulu had aban
doned practically all hope that he

could have survived after being re
ported overboard in high seas Wed
nesday at 10 a.m. PDT.
A radio report from the Munro
said Sierks was "resting well." The
ship had reported earlier that he
was alive, active but weak.

Rocky Marciano, the so - called
''hothouse" slugger from Brockton,
Mass., established himself as a dan
gerous heavyweight contender by
scoring an upset knockout over Rox
Lavne of Utah in Madison Square
Garden tonight.
