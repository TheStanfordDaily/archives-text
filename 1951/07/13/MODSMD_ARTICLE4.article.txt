## 
### 
NEW YORK, July 12 (UP)—Co- |
lumbiu Broadcasting System corre- I
spondent Robert P. Martin reported ;
from Tokyo tonight that Gen. Mat- '
thew B. Ridgway informed the
Communists peace talks will not be
resumed until the Reds remove all
armed personnel from the Kaesong
area.
Ridgway said each side should be j
limited to a maximum of 150 per- ;
sons in the conference area but that j
there should be mutual agreement
on the individuals to be in the ac- ;
tual conference room.
He also demanded a new confer- j
ence site in Kaesong.
The supreme commander by- !
passed the actual Communist ne- I
gotiators at Kaesong, who had not
yet replied to demands from him
and Vice-Adm. C. Turner Joy, the
No. 1 Allied negotiator, that there
be no more interference with Allied :
convoys.
His demands were made only a |
few hours after the Peiping radio
had aeused the United States of us
ing "bluff and pressure" tactics to
halt the cease-fire talks but had
called the breach a "tempodary sus
pension of armistice negotiations."
Peiping radio used harsh lan
guage in accusing the Americans of
•'violating the principle of mutual
agreement" to keep newsmen away !
from Kaesong.
Ridgway. in a 10-minute broad
cast to the Communist leaders, J
said restrictions had been placed on
his delegates by the Communist
delegation since the start of the
conference.
He said the assurances he asked |
were simple and few. They included
complete freedom of movement in
side the neutral zone and complete
freedom for selection of personnel,
including press representatives.
A United Nations convoy yester
day was turned back nine miles •
irom Kaesong by the Communists
because it contained a truck bear
ing 20 persons whom Ridgway said
he considered an "integral" part of
the Allied cease-fire team.
"The extension of the present re- j
cess is only due to unreasonable ;
and unnecessary restrictions against
which my representatives repeated
ly protested," Ridgway said.
The announceemnt was read first
over the armed forces radio station
in Korea and taped for rebroadcast
in Tokyo. Brig. Gen. Frank A. Al
len, Ridgway's public information
adviser, read the commander's j
statement.

tual conference room.
He also demanded a new confer- j
ence site in Kaesong.
The supreme commander by- !
passed the actual Communist ne- I
gotiators at Kaesong, who had not
yet replied to demands from him
and Vice-Adm. C. Turner Joy, the
No. 1 Allied negotiator, that there
be no more interference with Allied :
convoys.
His demands were made only a |
few hours after the Peiping radio
had aeused the United States of us
ing "bluff and pressure" tactics to
halt the cease-fire talks but had
called the breach a "tempodary sus
pension of armistice negotiations."
Peiping radio used harsh lan
guage in accusing the Americans of
•'violating the principle of mutual
agreement" to keep newsmen away !
from Kaesong.
Ridgway. in a 10-minute broad
cast to the Communist leaders, J
said restrictions had been placed on
his delegates by the Communist
delegation since the start of the
conference.
He said the assurances he asked |
were simple and few. They included
complete freedom of movement in
side the neutral zone and complete
freedom for selection of personnel,
including press representatives.
A United Nations convoy yester
day was turned back nine miles •
irom Kaesong by the Communists
because it contained a truck bear
ing 20 persons whom Ridgway said
he considered an "integral" part of
the Allied cease-fire team.
"The extension of the present re- j
cess is only due to unreasonable ;
and unnecessary restrictions against
which my representatives repeated
ly protested," Ridgway said.
The announceemnt was read first
over the armed forces radio station
in Korea and taped for rebroadcast
in Tokyo. Brig. Gen. Frank A. Al
len, Ridgway's public information
adviser, read the commander's j
statement.
