# NL Wins In All-Star Go
## 
### 
The National League showed its !
strongest power in 18 years as they j
copped the All-Star game Tuesday i
before over 59.000 in Detroit's J
Briggs Stadium.
Stan Musial, Gil Hodges. Ralph '
Kiner, nnd Bob Elliot slammed Jio- ;
mers for the winners. These four j
gentlemen have muscled out 73 |
round-trippers in regular season's \
play.
Detroitcrs George Kell and Vic
Wertz kept the home-towners hap
py by swatting homers for the los
ers.
Sal Maglie, lanky Giant ace, took
the win for the senior loop, mainly
because he happened to be hurling j
while his mates lowered the boom !
on Yankee Eddie Lopat in the j
fourth inning. Lopat surrendered j
two homers and three runs in his j
one-inning sojourn on the mound j
and was charged with the defeat.
Hero of the American League j
squad and possibly the game was j
slender Ned Carver. Garver twirled I
one-hit ball during his three-inning i
stint on the mound. Garver is used
to pitching well for a losing team,
as he pitches for the hapless St.
Louis Browns. His 11 wins for the
Browns are keeping the Browns
from establishing an all-time los
ing record.


THE FIRST TOSS of Tuesday's
18th annual All - Star game is
hurled platcward by starting
American League pitcher Ned
Garver of St. Louis. The tensed
hatter is Richie Asltburn of the
Phillies. The umpire is Art Pas
