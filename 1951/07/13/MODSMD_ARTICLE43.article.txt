Modern Peru welcomes and pro
tects the investment of foreign capi
tal, Ambassador Fernando Bercke
rneyer of Peru emphasized in his
Tuesday evening address in Memo
rial Hall.
He outlined the healthy financial
iir.d technological situation that ex
ists in Peru today.
•'While all of Peru's problems
not been solved, the present
administration has made much
progress toward national prosperity
through the promotion banks and

public works projects, and by stim
ulating an atmosphere of free trade
and commerce.
Berckemever stated that few
] countries can boast a better record
in their association with the invest
ment of foreign capital than Peru.
"There has been no record of
J confiscation or appropriation of for
eign funds in the history of Peru,
j and absolute competitive freedom
of trade exists there.
J "Peru's promotion banks, which
j were set up to aid agriculture, min
ing, and industry, have recently

had their capital expanded. Conse
quently they are now able to float
long-term loans to assist farmers,
mining companies, and small manu
facturers."
Dr. Bcrckemcyer said the Peru
vian sol. which was formerly peg
ged at the artificial level of (i.5 to
the dollar, has now been allowed to
find its own level in the world mar
ket.
With the sol at a more realistic
value, he said, the country's econ
omy i: now adjusting itself to the
proper level.

"The public works projects in
Peru," he slated, "are helping to
solve its largest current problem,
the distribution of food products.
Along with other projects, public
works are helping expand Peru's
growing system of highways, so
that the distribution of food and
the transport of raw matedials and
manufactured products may be im
proved."
An important piece of legislation
now being considered is an agrarian
law that wil! establish ownership of
newly reclaimed lands for the small

farmer, he said. All sucli laws in
Peru will be of benefit to the In
dian.
