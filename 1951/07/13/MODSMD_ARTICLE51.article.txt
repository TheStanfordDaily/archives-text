# Metallurgy Institutes New Curriculum
## 
### 
Starting fall quarter, 1951, the
Metallurgical Department of the
Stanford School of Mineral Sciences
will institute a new "Metallurgical
Science" curriculum, while the
present curriculum will continue as
"Metallurgical Engineering."
The two curricula will be about
the same for the first two years.
Beginning with the junior year, the
emphasis in the Metallurgical Sci
ence curriculum will be on the

basic sciences rather than on engi
neering, and most of the engineer- ,
ing courses now required under |
Metallurgical Engineering will be I
replaced by courses in the Physics, !
Mathematics, and Chemistry de
partments.
It will be possible to earn a Ph.D. j
degree in Metallurgical Science.!

Ph.D. candidates will have attained i
the equivalent of an undergraduate j
minor in physics, and will have had j
thorough training in chemical anal- j
ysis and thermodynamics.
The new program will be under \
the direction of O. C. Shepard, with
W. J. Crook, A. K. Shellinger, and !
1.. D. Hall assisting.
