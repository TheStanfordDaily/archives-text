# Testing Centerâ€”Aptitude, Hearts and Flowers
## 
### CHUCK THOMAS 
For the first time in its five-year
history, the Stanford Counseling
and Testing Center is going without
that summer vacation to help you
with some of your vocational and |
academic problems.
The center was started in 19W as
j a guidance service for veterans.
Then last fall it was expanded to
provide year-round counseling for
the entire student body. Last quar
ter the center helped almost 500
students and administered over 900
: individual tests, besides handling j
! 2,100 group tests.
The counseling services range !
j from vocational guidance to hearts
and-flowers. Most of the problems
I brought to the counselors fall into
' one of three groups: assistance in
determining aptitude for certain j

jobs, help in academic troubles that
are due to poor study habits, and
the kind of things some people write
to Dorothy Dix about.
As Dr. John D. Blak, director of
the center, sees it, the service is an
attempt to close the gnp" between
the old educational ideals of the
small college, and the modern real
ity of a big University. Since it is
no longer possible for a professor
to know each of his students inti
mately, the counseling center offers
a student the personal attention he
needs in solving some of his prob
lems.
But the center doesn't set itself
Up as any sort of institutional pat
ent medicine, or even a king-sized
psychiatrist. It makes no claim to
cure all ills and solve all problems.
"We just try to help people view

themselves and their problems
more objectively," explains Dr.
Black. "Then they make their own
decisions."
Among the facilities of the center
is the vocational library. Here a
student may find, listed by jobs, in
formation on the salaries, openings,
training, and conditions in any line
of work.
For the student who is more wor
ried about getting out of Stanford
than where to go after he gets out,
the counseling service conducts a
Study Skills Clinic. This clinic pro
vides help in developing better
study habits and learning to read
faster.
The services of the center are
open to all students free of charge.
The Offices are located in 102 A, In
ner Quad. But they don't have a
blind-date department.

For the first time in its five-year
history, the Stanford Counseling
and Testing Center is going without
that summer vacation to help you
with some of your vocational and |
academic problems.
The center was started in 19W as
j a guidance service for veterans.
Then last fall it was expanded to
provide year-round counseling for
the entire student body. Last quar
ter the center helped almost 500
students and administered over 900
: individual tests, besides handling j
! 2,100 group tests.
The counseling services range !
j from vocational guidance to hearts
and-flowers. Most of the problems
I brought to the counselors fall into
' one of three groups: assistance in
determining aptitude for certain j

jobs, help in academic troubles that
are due to poor study habits, and
the kind of things some people write
to Dorothy Dix about.
As Dr. John D. Blak, director of
the center, sees it, the service is an
attempt to close the gnp" between
the old educational ideals of the
small college, and the modern real
ity of a big University. Since it is
no longer possible for a professor
to know each of his students inti
mately, the counseling center offers
a student the personal attention he
needs in solving some of his prob
lems.
But the center doesn't set itself
Up as any sort of institutional pat
ent medicine, or even a king-sized
psychiatrist. It makes no claim to
cure all ills and solve all problems.
"We just try to help people view

themselves and their problems
more objectively," explains Dr.
Black. "Then they make their own
decisions."
Among the facilities of the center
is the vocational library. Here a
student may find, listed by jobs, in
formation on the salaries, openings,
training, and conditions in any line
of work.
For the student who is more wor
ried about getting out of Stanford
than where to go after he gets out,
the counseling service conducts a
Study Skills Clinic. This clinic pro
vides help in developing better
study habits and learning to read
faster.
The services of the center are
