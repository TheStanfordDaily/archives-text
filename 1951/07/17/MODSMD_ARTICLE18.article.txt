# BULL SESSION

### ANON E. MUS 
Having been run oil campus by
an intolerant mob of women who
read last week's column lor men
only, the author is writing this at
an inner sanctuary in Outer Mon
golia.
Fellow man. Leave us not be in
timidated by that part ol our spe
cif; variously known as a miss,
bn ad. frill, wench, vixen, quail, and
Stanford woman (missed any
thing?). Instead, lot us rally be
hind the battle-cry of our noble
cause: "(jet Thee to a Nunnery,
Woman."
Perhaps a few more tidbits of
food for thought will help us to
gather courage in this hour of need.
Let us pay heed to the words of
one of our champions, Benjamin
Di raeli:
' Every woman should marry - -
an ! no man
II you're not inclined to Â«_;o that
fa: in our righteous cause, then
pe haps William Makepeace Thack
ray sounds the right note:
' Remember, men, it's as easy to
m i ry a rich woman as a poor one.''
But maybe you are the romantic
tyi e Then you will appreciate the
wi dom ol George Lillo, who once
said:
'"The firmest purpose ol a woman's
heart

To well-timed, artful flattery may
yield."
This advice merits thoughtful
consideration. Not all men can be
so artful; however, for those with
the blunt approach there is still
some hope. Witness this gem from
one of the great scholars, Ovid:
"Whether they give or they refuse,
To have been asked, delights wom
en."
Do\Cn through ages man has been
advising Man about Woman. But
has Man profited by all these sage
words? Has he learned how to deal
with the so-called "weaker" sex?
No! Man is still being victimized bv
scheming, conniving women.
"Man was born free but every
where he is in chains," can well
apply to many of our brothers.
Woman has been. is. and always
will be an enigma.
Sometimes sweet, sometimes ca
pricious, and sometimes distracting
never predictable: almost feline
ill her self-attentiveness, almost ca
nine m her determination, almost
supine in her feigned indifference to
man, is woman.
We leave you with our thought
for today, cflurtesy of Lord Byron:
"Let us have wine and women,
mirth and laughter; sermons and
soda water, the day after."
Remain flexible.
