### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, July 17â€”Hope- i
ful Allied negotiators returned to
Kaesong today for the fifth Korean
truce meeting with the outlook for j
an armistice much brighter because |
of progress made yesterday and the |
friendly atmosphere of the meet
ings.
The negotiators delayed today's i
meeting from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. at j
the Communist request, but there j
was no explanation and no con- j
cern,- for the ice jam thawed yes- j
terday and the delegates exchanged j
their first known smiles.
