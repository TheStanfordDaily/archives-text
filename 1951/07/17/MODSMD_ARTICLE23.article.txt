Although there is 110 intercol- |
legiate competition during the
summer, thut is no excuse why
Stanford's intramural program |
should he as dead as Inner Quad
on a Sunday afternoon.
There may be reasons for this j
stoppage of intramural activity. But j
student interest, which is very im- J
portant, should be considered be- j
fore halting this form of recreation j
which promotes relaxation, compe- j
tition, rivalry, and develops friend- '
ship and teamwork.
The University should give se
rious thought to an intramural
program for the coming summer.
Highway Sport Spots
Until the University does take ac
tion. I have a suggestion. There are

numerous spots
on El Camino
where frustrated
athletes may
find outlets for
their prowess.
One of these
s uc h a m use
ments is Batter
Up. a baseball

range about four
miles south. It is a deal where balls ,
are thrown to you by an automatic, i
compressed-air gun. There are six \
batting cages complete with flood
lights, plates, dirt, and bats.
The Brooklyn Dodgers, under the
genius of Branch Rickey, first de
veloped these automatic pitchers to |
save wear on the human model !
during batting practice.
It is also quite a kick to sec var- i
ious individuals taking their cuts; j
some serious, some imitating big
leaguers, and some just looking
silly. This latter category is espe
cially true of the fairer sex, who
just weren't put together to bat
baseballs.
Colt' Driving Range
South of this is a golf driving
range, complete with a pitch and
putt course, and lawn furniture for
the arm-chair athletes. This is one
of the finest and most complete golf j
ranges on the Peninsula. Also, girls j
don't look quite as silly here.
Back up the highway there is a
miniature 18-hole coif course, com
plete with obstacles and even a !
nearby nineteenth hole. As this \
game is mostly luck, not skill, it is j
equally fair to a girl; however, men j
who want to keep the upper hand j
go to the Batter Up or the real driv
ing range, 'cause that golf ball can
take awful strange hops on the min- |
iature course. Could be embarrass- j
ing when the gal gets a hole in one,
looking the other way, while the
guy goes five over par.
So until the University does j
something about the present ban
011 summer intramurals, it's best
to seek your athletic releases ]
down the highway. And it's not
too bad, because they tell me that !
places like Dinah's. L'Ommie.'s,
and Longbarn, etc., serve as much
better clubhouses than the men's i
gym.
