WASHINGTON, July 19 (UP) —Secretary of State Dean Acheson
served notice tonight that the United States and its UN allies are
willing to risk a break in truce talks rather than pull their troops
out of Korea immediately.
His statement, cleared in advance with President Truman and

the 16 UN nations helping in the
Korea fight, made it clear that the
Allies do not intend to knuckle un
der to the troop - withdrawal de
mand of the North Korean and Chi
nese Communist negotiators.
Acheson's unexpected statement
spelling out the Allies' position was
issued only about an hour before
UN truce negotiators were sched
uled to meet with their Commu
nist counterparts in a showdown
session in Kaesong.
Acheson's statement emphasized
the Allies' stand that the troop issue
is political rather than* miliary in
nature.
Informed sources said his nation's
allies supported the principles out
lined by the Secretary, although
they had not seen the specific
wording of his statement.
Acheson recalled that foreign
forces were withdrawn from Korea
in 1948 and 1949 as part of a UN
plan to reach fipal settlement of the
Korean problem.
'"The Communists defied this ef
fort and committed aggression
against the Republic of Korea," the
Secretary said. "The Korean people
can be assured that a repetition of
this act will not be tolerated."
At the same time, he sought to
reassure the Communists that the
presence of UN troops in Korea
during a post - armistice period
would not pose a threat to their
security.
