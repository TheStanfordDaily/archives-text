# Bayshore and the Prof
## 
### 
Bayshore is in the news again. Albert K. Orschel, acting piofes
sor of law here this summer, has thrown a bombshell at the lassi
tude with which people around here view the daily slaughter on
' 31oody Bayshore."
Professor Orschel, a newcomer to California, wrote a letter to
Gov. Earl Warren, stating that traffic on Bayshore is "infinitely
more hazardous than on comparable roads in other metropolitan
areas," including Chicago and New York, and urging the Governor
to take action to eliminate the high number of deaths on that high
way.
Publication of Professor Orschel's letter has brought a burst
of action from many quarters. San Mateo County has reactivated
its county traffic safety commission and ordered it to find ways
to cut down the death toll on Bayshore. The Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce is campaigning for concerted action of civic groups,
and people have written letters to the Palo Alto Times.
The Times reports that an average of nearly one life a week has
been lost on Bayshore so far this year. We commend Professor
Orschel for speaking up, even though he has had to criticize as a
newcomer to the area.
Looks like the professor has started something — something
which has needed starting for a long time.—B. B.
