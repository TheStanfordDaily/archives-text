# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Where There's Smoke... 
### 
Tn the Editor:
Who wrote that silly little edito
rial on the glories of smoking in the
library? It is suggested that this
most recent regression is "prog
ress"; that it will lend toward
greater "pleasure," and will, no
doubt (in some unexplained myste
rious manner), result in less noise
and confusion about these precincts.
My friend (whoever you are),
you have been reading too many
cigarette ads. "Pleasure"? I doubt
it. I, for one, do not appreciate in
haling second-hand expirations of
these human chimneys.
"Progress"? Stanford needs to
make progress in some other direc
tion. For seven quarters now I
have beeh the recessive character
in my classes as I slink back from
fuming pipes, cigars, and cigarettes

about me. Let teachers and .stu
dents swear in class if they wish.
Let them chew tobacco if they
choose. But brother, when they
light up, they're polluting the very
air 1 breathe. I object.
"Silence"? Come now. Since
when has smoking been conducive
to good order? You have been see
ing too many ads suggesting some
mysterious bond between silent so
phistication and graceful smoking.
Bosh!
The smoking advocates have been
vociferous and persistent. They
have disregarded just rules and
regulations while those who turn
green in their backwash have kept
silence. I'm beginning to get out of
the mood for silence. The time has j
come for the other side to speak up. ;
JOHN D. GEORGE
