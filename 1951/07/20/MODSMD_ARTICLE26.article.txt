OK, men, here it is. This is your
golden chance to get some exercise
ind get rid of that Rossotti's roll
around the belt - buckle. Starting
next week, we're going to have
some summer intramural sports—
something besides that alter - dark
o-ed wrestling out in the cactus
gardens, *that is.
A couple of hustling freshmen
and a sponsor got things started last
week when they set up a nine-man
volleyball fuss at Toyon. Then
Daily sports editor Larry Calm gave
the thing a push in his Tuesday eol
rnn. And now old Uncle Chuckle
has a proposition (or a proposal, if
you doubt my intentions) for all
you bar-stool Durochers who have
just the right pointers to help Mu
siaj shake his batting slump.
i:k;iit and onk is nine
All you've got to do is get eight
•her guys who've been overlooked
by those blind major league scouts.
Now, that makes nine altogether.
(You may think this is a relatively
unimportant point. But it wasn't
just by happy coincidence that the
girls' volleyball league decided to
use nine lovelies on a team. So who
M - e we to fight it?)
Then just dig a nickel out of your
jeans and get ahold of either George
Stewart at Toyon or one of the
sports scribblers at The Daily. It's
that easy. No box - tops, no 50-
words-or-less, no nothing.
The only entry fee for this bash
< $220. payable to the Registrar at
the beginning of summer quarter.
James will be played late enough
m the afternoon so they won't in
erfere with the academic pastimes
iround here, and early enough so
hey won't be cluttering up the in
ranutral fields when the moi'J am
orous pursuits get under way.
IiVKN YOU CAN BE FAMOUS
This may be the chance of a life
ime. Maybe next August you'll be
.vearing a Yankee uniform and see
ng the World Series from the on
leck circle. After all, DiMaggio is
njured, Mantle's back in the mi
iois, and Coleman's in a slump,
neumonia may strike the bat-boy
my day now.
Personally, I've got a great idea
or a soltball team. I'm going to get
ihold of those eight jokers who are
rying to steal my woman. We
night to be an unbeatable combi
lation. None of us have ever got to
.ist base yet.
