## 
### 
Our modern notion of the fine
arts is actually 200 years old, Dr.
Paul Oskar Kristeller, noted Re
naissance scholar from Columbia,
tokl a Tuesday Evening Series au
dience earlier this week.
Id a lecture entitled "The Origin
of the Modern Notion of Art," Dr.
Kristeller traced the development
of the idea of art from classical an
tiquity to the eighteenth century.
The live major arts as we know
them painting, sculpture, architec
ture, poetry, and music — did not
emerge as separate and distinct
classifications until the eighteenth
century, Professor Kristeller noted.
Charles Batteux, a French phi
lo ;opher, pointed the way to the

modern classification in 17 li). but it
remained i'or a Gei man philosopher,
Alexander Bauntgarten, to set forth
the five fine arts as we know them.
Renaissance artists, who laid the
,uround work for the modern notion
of art, often debated the relative
merits of the various arts, but they
always defended the art which they
practiced—that is. all except Mi
chelangelo who remained unbiased
because he was both a painter and
a sculptor.
This afternoon at 1. Dr. Kristeller
will deliver the last of .i series of
philosophy lectures. This lecture,
"Music and Learning in the Renais
sance," will be held in Room DO. It
