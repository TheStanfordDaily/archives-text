TEHRAN, Iran, July 19 (UP) â€”
Government officials agreed tonight
at a meeting with W. Averell Har
riman, U.S. ambassador-at-large, to
reopen negotiations with the British
in the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute.
It was the first sign of a possible
break in the fight touched off by
the nationalization of the British
controlled oil fields at Abadan.
Harriman met with the mixed
Iranian oil commission for two
hours despite a warning by police
that a plot was uncovered to assas
sinate him.
"We are prepared to sit down
again and talk with the British,"
Kazem Hassibi, Iran's top oil ex
pert. said. "However, we are not
prepared to back down on the prin
ciple of nationalization."
"I'm not at all opposed to the
principle of nationalization, since
the United States government is in
terested in the independence of ev
ery country," Harriman said.
