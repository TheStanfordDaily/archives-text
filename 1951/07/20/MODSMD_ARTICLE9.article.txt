# Students to Send Toys to Koreans
## 
### 
A shipment of educational toys
made by Stanford students is to be
sent to Korean school children soon.
The toys are to be sent to Super
intendent Won Kyn Kim of the
Seoul public schools. Dr. Kim got
acquainted with Stanford when he
visited here last year.
The toys—trucks, tugboats, trains,
and flexible dolls—were patterned
and built by the 30 students in Miss
Mary - Margaret Scobey's class in
"Industrial Arts for the Modern
Teacher."
Superintendent Kim's teachers
were evacuated to Pusan when the
invasion of South Korea came. Most
of their materials, however, were
left behind. Consequently educa
tional materials are needed in the
Seoul schools.
The toys are not only to be used
as playthings by the Korean chil
dren, but can also be used to act
out "real life" activities.
Miss Scobey intends to put the
toy factory into production again
this fall.
