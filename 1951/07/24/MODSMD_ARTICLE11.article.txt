# Where's the Fire?

### 
"Always give the exact location of a fire when you call tiid
firemen," is the plea of the Stanford Fire Department after being
led on a wild goose chase last Friday.
At 11:55 am. a call came in to the Fire Department saying that
there was a fire at Hilltop. The firemen rushed off to Cubberley
House, which was formerly named Hilltop House. When they
got there, however, all was cool and placid, and no signs of i
fire existed.
Meanwhile the fixe was blazing away in the kitchen of Hilltop
Cottage out in Interdale. The firemen finally got the right infor
mation and arrived at the scene of the blaze, but not until S3GO
damage had been done in the kitchen.
All the firemen have to say is, "The next time you have a fire,
please tell us exactly where it is!"
