I was down at L'Ommie's the other night downing my sours over
P' or Stanford's financial problem when I suddenly blossomed
foith with an idea. Why doesnt' Stanford buy L'Ommie's? Its
financial problems would be over.
The idea met with such complete appioval by my "milk-drink
ing" companions that there and then 1 decided to present it to the
Board of Trustees. A panacea for all our difficulties.
The purchase would have unlimited possibilities. A student
body card would serve as one's ID.
The language requirement would be unnecessary, for we would
all be able to speak French fluently, and pass any test, providing
the Romanic Languages Department becomes practical and uses
the French spoken at L'Omelette.
We could build another memorial to add to Stanford's growing
collection. It would be called MEM AN.DRE, and would be used
"to further develop and stimulate research in the field of zyin
urgy."
In especially good years, a certain percentage of the profits
would be returned to the students in the form of rebates. What
could be more idyllic?
After the University added L'Ommie's to its holdings, many
more practical applications of its potentialities would be discov
ered. Classrooms .extension courses, employment openings, plus
the moral boost to Farm students which is beyond money value.
Further purchases of such places as Rossotti's, Dinah's. Long
barn, etc.. would be made possible by this first purchase. There
would be no more need for BOE's, for honest, responsible Encina
men would act as student police.
Stanford's income would be multiplied many times. Roads
could be repaired. The new Union could be built. There would
b> no end to the improvements Stanford could make. We could
buy Cal. Professors would be able to eat three squareÂ»meals a day.
Well, what are we waiting for?
