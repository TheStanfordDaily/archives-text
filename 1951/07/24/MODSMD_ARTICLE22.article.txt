The saying goes there is no sense leaving for tomorrow what one
can do today, so here goes with a collection of sports shorts.
Big Bill McColl is currently at USC summer session taking a chemistry
course. This will lighten his study load this footballing fall when he
.starts Med School.
Bill has taken up golf, and of course is doing well. His partner, one ,
Gary Ktrkorian, Stanford's top QB.
Dick Horn, another Stanford QB, is playing recreational basketball in
;t Santa Monica league. Guess who's playing with him? That's right - !
McColl. He played a lot in high school, and he always has liked the game. |
Don I.iebendorfer, publicity director, forecasts many national maga
zines and football annuals will feature a cover of McColl. Stanford's Ail-
American end.
On the subject of football. Chuck Taylor and his stall will get together
starting Aug. 1 to lay plans for the grid campaign.
l.niery Mitchell, ex-Stanford fullback, who was once told he would
never play ball again, signed recently to play semi-pro football with the
San Francisco Broncos of the Northern California Football League.
(lards Active in Professional Baseball
There seem to be a lot of Cards active in the baseball world.
Dave Dahle, ex-Stanford pitcher, who turned pro two years back, re- i
eently got his first starting assignment for the Oakland Oaks in the PCL. j
He lost it because of sloppy defensive play. Now he is used mostly in
relief.
Liebendorfer told me the story of the closest thing to a no-hit game j
he ever saw at Stanford; the pitcher. Dahle. It went something like this: '
jate in the season, playing St. Mary's ninth inning, two outs, two strikes j
on the batter, the weakest hitter in the league and he singles to spoil ;
Dave's perfect game.
Chez is currently throwing fast balls and breaking stuff for the j
Pendleton Kanchcrs, a semi-pro outfit in Oregon. In twenty-five innings. |
Joe has only allowed two earned runs.
Jack lleiiH'ii. of the San Jose Red Sox, who threw for the Indians \
last year, has developed a sore arm. He is at present sidelined for treat- j
neat.
Baseball, Softball, anil Golf ~
Playing with the Reno Silver Sox in the Far West League is Dick
C'le;g, who only last spring roamed the outer garden for Stanford's dia- j
monders.
Stanford is also well represented in the Palo Alto Recreational Soft- :
ball League. Lowe's Realtors claim three Cards. Playing shortstop is as
istant baseball mentor Bill Alhouse. Catching is Kay Hammett, ex-assist- '
«nt football aid. Alternate pitcher is assistant basketball coach Gus Cha» '
valas.
Bobby Rosburg, who did so well in the Stanford Golf Tourney over
the weekend, passed up a chance to play in the Morse Cup champion
ships at Spokane. Reason: Any minute he will be a father.
That cleans the desk for now.

(lards Active in Professional Baseball
There seem to be a lot of Cards active in the baseball world.
Dave Dahle, ex-Stanford pitcher, who turned pro two years back, re- i
eently got his first starting assignment for the Oakland Oaks in the PCL. j
He lost it because of sloppy defensive play. Now he is used mostly in
relief.
Liebendorfer told me the story of the closest thing to a no-hit game j
he ever saw at Stanford; the pitcher. Dahle. It went something like this: '
jate in the season, playing St. Mary's ninth inning, two outs, two strikes j
on the batter, the weakest hitter in the league and he singles to spoil ;
Dave's perfect game.
Chez is currently throwing fast balls and breaking stuff for the j
Pendleton Kanchcrs, a semi-pro outfit in Oregon. In twenty-five innings. |
Joe has only allowed two earned runs.
Jack lleiiH'ii. of the San Jose Red Sox, who threw for the Indians \
last year, has developed a sore arm. He is at present sidelined for treat- j
neat.
Baseball, Softball, anil Golf ~
Playing with the Reno Silver Sox in the Far West League is Dick
C'le;g, who only last spring roamed the outer garden for Stanford's dia- j
monders.
Stanford is also well represented in the Palo Alto Recreational Soft- :
ball League. Lowe's Realtors claim three Cards. Playing shortstop is as
istant baseball mentor Bill Alhouse. Catching is Kay Hammett, ex-assist- '
«nt football aid. Alternate pitcher is assistant basketball coach Gus Cha» '
valas.
Bobby Rosburg, who did so well in the Stanford Golf Tourney over
the weekend, passed up a chance to play in the Morse Cup champion
ships at Spokane. Reason: Any minute he will be a father.
That cleans the desk for now.
The saying goes there is no sense leaving for tomorrow what one
can do today, so here goes with a collection of sports shorts.
Big Bill McColl is currently at USC summer session taking a chemistry
course. This will lighten his study load this footballing fall when he
.starts Med School.
