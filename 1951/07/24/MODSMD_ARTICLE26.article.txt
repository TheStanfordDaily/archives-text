# Hispanic-American Institute Is Conducting Extensive Studies on Peru, Past and Present
## 
### HERB SEITER 
In the year 1551 the region that
is now the United States was a wil
derness explored by only a few
hardy adventurers. Probably noth
ing was farther from the minds of
those explorers than the founding
of a university. Yet, in that same
year, a university was founded in
Lima, Peru.
This year the University of San
Marcos in Lima is commemorating
the fourth centenary of its found
ing. Here at Stanford the centenary
is being commemorated by the His
panic- American Institute where the
summer's studies are being devoted
to "Peru, Past and Present."
Fourth Session
The Hispanic-American Institute
is now in its fourth annual summer
session at Stanford. The Institute is
devoted to the study of Latin
America and is probably the only
one of its nature in the United
States.
Carrying out the theme ''Peru,
Past and Present," the Institute is
conducting a series of lectures and
classroom studies on economic, so
cial. and cultural affairs in Peru.
The classroom work is extended by
the preparation of the monthly His
panic American Keport. which as
sesses events occurring in South
America and Spain.
Visiting Lecturer
To bring the students closer to

! Peru, Dr. Alfonso Espinosa, a vis
| iting lecturer from the University
! of San Marcos, is conducting two
| coudses at the Institute on Peru-
I vian history and Peruvian litera
i ture.
A large number of Latin Ameri
can visitors come to the campus to
give guest lectures. All such lec
tures are delivered in Spanish or
| Portuguese to free the speaker of
| any language difficulties, and to
! yive the student opportunity to use
I these languages which are essential
I to anyone studying Hispanic Amer
| ican affairs.
Interest Livened
Director Ronald Hilton believes
that the Institute is performing a
valuable task. He says,"It keeps
alive an interest in Latin America
at a time when there is a tendency
to forget Latin America and think
i only about areas closer to Russia.
"In a way this trend is a good
; thing, because now we can engage
I in more sober and scientific re
! search. While serious interest in
I Latin America is increasing, the
! popular interest has declined.
Therefore, the whole quality of His
panic American studies is healthier
; than during the hey-day of Pan-
Americanism."
The Hispanic American Institute
i opened at the beginning of summer
; quarter with the three-day Stan
i ford Conference on the Technical
Development of Latin America.
Experts Gather
Experts from all parts of the
United States gathered to discuss
problems concerning technical co
operation between this country and
South America. Technical advanee-
I ment ot Peru is particularly a orob

lern because of her large desert
areas that create many problems in
commercial development.
The Institute is sponsoring a se
i lies of public lectures in conjunc
tion with the Peruvian program. At
the first of these two lectures Pro
j fessor Langdon White spoke on the
highlands of Peru. The next week
Ambassador Berckemeyer of Peru
spoke on the development of mod
ern Peru.
Other lecturers in the series are
Julius Klein, chairman of the Klein
Mission to Peru, Dr. Espinosa, Pro
fessor Graham Stuart, Professor
Paul Hannah, and Professor Ronald
Hilton.
