# 'Classrooms Needed, Not Monuments'
## 
### 
America is building "too many
community monuments" instead of
real working classrooms that will
help school children, an authority
on classroom design charged here
yesterday.
Consulting educationist Dr. Dar
ell Boyd Harmon of Austin, Texas,
told Stanford University's Annual
Conference on School Planning that
"despite noble intentions of com
munity sponsors, too many schools
are not what they should be—eco
nomical and functional buildings."
He was the principal speaker on
the opening day of the five - day
conference at the University's
School of Education. More than 400
school officials, architects, and
builders from several Western
states are attending the conference.
Pseudo-Esthetic
"The money being put into arti
ficial chimneys, balconies, and tow
ers to achieve a pseudo-esthetic ap
pearance could be better spent for
additional classrooms," Dr. Harmon
said.
"A child's body may easily grow
along lines of stresses brought
about by poor lighting, faulty heat
ing, and other harmful environ
mental conditions in the classroom,
and ,in the end the body may be
subject to physical and psychologi
cal damage," he said.
Interrelationships
Parents and educators, he said,
have failed to realize how close is
the relationship between the child's
mental, psychological, and social
problems.
Dr. James D. MacConnell, asso
ciate dean of the School of Educa
tion, who is in charge of the con
ference, explained the program to
visitors yesterday in opening the
discussions.
"Co-4/rdinated Classroom"
Dr. Harmon, former director of
the Division of School Health for
the Texas State Department of
Health, and now serving as visit
ing professor of education at Stan
ford, has directed studies of more
than 1(50,000 school children.
From these studies he has worked
out the principles of the "co-ordi
nated classroom" in schoolroom
planning. During the last three
years the results of his studies have
been reflected in the design of over
three-quarters of a billion dollars
of new schools from Alaska to Flor
ida and from Ontario to Texas.
