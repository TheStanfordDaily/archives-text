TWO "LITTLE INDIANS"—Irene, 4, and Celine, 3, daughters
of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Herzing, test the model classroom which
is a feature of the new 570,000 School Plant Planning Laboratory
which has just been opened in the basement of the School of
Education. The model classroom, built on a scale of three inches
to the foot, is intended for testing of lighting and color problems
rather than for the use of little girls. Herzing, who teaches at
.Sequoia High School, is studying guidance and personnel work
