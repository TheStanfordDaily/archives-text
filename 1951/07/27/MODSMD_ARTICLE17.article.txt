## A 						Tradition Is Dying 
### 
in recent years the habit of smoking has been cultivated by an
increasing number of people. The spreading of this habit has re
sulted in the virtual death of one of Stanford's oldest traditions,
that of no smoking on Quad.
The tradition came about from a reguest made by Mrs. Stanford
through Dr. David Starr Jordan in the early days of the University.
The students resolved to respect Mrs. Stanford's wishes and
through the years the tradition was carefully observed. During
the war, the custom was neglected either because of the ignorance
or the indifference of the large numbr of outsiders who invaded
the Farm.
In a Founders' Day address on Stanford tradtions on March 9,
19-4, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur had this to say ab«ut no smoking on
Quad: "In the days of the corncob pipe and the brown 'roll-your
ov/n cigarette there was but little difficulty in having it given gen
eral acceptance. Now, with the tailor-made cigarette and with its
use also by our women students, there is a tendency for this tradi
tion to go up in cigarette smoke. In a way it is not so significant
as are the other traditions, but it is one of those things that, if
mainained, help to keep up the Family morale."
Since the time Dr. Wilbur made his remarks attempts to revive
the tradition through the incoming freshman classes have proved
fruitless. The tradition is no longer kept, even among faculty mem
bers.
Certainly this unsatisfactory state of affairs cannot remain. If
the students wish to preserve the tradition, then they should by
all means observe it. If they decide that it has outlived its time,
then they should make their opinions heard and end this fiction
of its existence.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of students, is in favor of bringing
this guestion before the student body so that it can be settled once
and for all. Under present circumstances it seems unlikely that
any large number of students will be in favor of keeping the tradi
tion. Even Fred Glover, the director of information, who looks back
to the old days with nostalgia, regards it as a "cooked goose."
However, it is still necessary for those who wish to see the tra
dition abolished to express their opinions through the Daily or
to Excom. As long as the tradition exists theoretically, the Univer
sity cannot properly place receptacles on Inner Quad for cigarette
butts. This results in the untidy litter of butts which is at present
in evidence. At the same time, it creates extra difficulties for those
responsible for cleaning the Quad.
If the tradition is abolished, it may do much to help solve a re
lated problem, that of no smoking in Quad buildings. The ruling of
no smoking in Quad buildings is made because of the fire hazard
and should be kept.
However, as things now stand, it is just as illegal to smoke on
Quad as it is inside Quad buildings. This means that anyone wish
ing to have a smoke without violating either the ruling or the tra
dition has to go all the way to Outer Quad before he can do so.
But in view of the short periods between classes, this is not very
practical.
If smoking on Inner Quad is made legal, most people would be
willing to step out of a building for a smoke rather than to remain
indoors and violate a University ruling.—David Wong.

as are the other traditions, but it is one of those things that, if
mainained, help to keep up the Family morale."
Since the time Dr. Wilbur made his remarks attempts to revive
the tradition through the incoming freshman classes have proved
fruitless. The tradition is no longer kept, even among faculty mem
bers.
Certainly this unsatisfactory state of affairs cannot remain. If
the students wish to preserve the tradition, then they should by
all means observe it. If they decide that it has outlived its time,
then they should make their opinions heard and end this fiction
of its existence.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of students, is in favor of bringing
this guestion before the student body so that it can be settled once
and for all. Under present circumstances it seems unlikely that
any large number of students will be in favor of keeping the tradi
tion. Even Fred Glover, the director of information, who looks back
to the old days with nostalgia, regards it as a "cooked goose."
However, it is still necessary for those who wish to see the tra
dition abolished to express their opinions through the Daily or
to Excom. As long as the tradition exists theoretically, the Univer
sity cannot properly place receptacles on Inner Quad for cigarette
butts. This results in the untidy litter of butts which is at present
in evidence. At the same time, it creates extra difficulties for those
responsible for cleaning the Quad.
If the tradition is abolished, it may do much to help solve a re
lated problem, that of no smoking in Quad buildings. The ruling of
no smoking in Quad buildings is made because of the fire hazard
and should be kept.
However, as things now stand, it is just as illegal to smoke on
Quad as it is inside Quad buildings. This means that anyone wish
ing to have a smoke without violating either the ruling or the tra
dition has to go all the way to Outer Quad before he can do so.
But in view of the short periods between classes, this is not very
practical.
If smoking on Inner Quad is made legal, most people would be
willing to step out of a building for a smoke rather than to remain
indoors and violate a University ruling.—David Wong.

in recent years the habit of smoking has been cultivated by an
increasing number of people. The spreading of this habit has re
sulted in the virtual death of one of Stanford's oldest traditions,
that of no smoking on Quad.
The tradition came about from a reguest made by Mrs. Stanford
through Dr. David Starr Jordan in the early days of the University.
The students resolved to respect Mrs. Stanford's wishes and
through the years the tradition was carefully observed. During
the war, the custom was neglected either because of the ignorance
or the indifference of the large numbr of outsiders who invaded
the Farm.
In a Founders' Day address on Stanford tradtions on March 9,
19-4, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur had this to say ab«ut no smoking on
Quad: "In the days of the corncob pipe and the brown 'roll-your
ov/n cigarette there was but little difficulty in having it given gen
eral acceptance. Now, with the tailor-made cigarette and with its
use also by our women students, there is a tendency for this tradi
tion to go up in cigarette smoke. In a way it is not so significant
as are the other traditions, but it is one of those things that, if
mainained, help to keep up the Family morale."
