# Lab for School Planning Opened in Ed Building
## 
### 
Stanford opened a new laboratory Wednesday, containing $70,-
000 worth of what every young school superintendent should
know.
The laboratory, housing the latest in school building equipment,
both standard and experimental, and model displays of almost
every type of building materials, is housed in the basement of the

I Stanford School of Education.
1 More than 400 school officials, ar-
I chitects, and builders were given a
I preview of the new laboratory as a
| feature of the School of Education's
] Annual Conference on School Plan
ning, which will conclude its five
| day program today.
Two years in the planning stage,
i and made possible through the co
poeration of more than 60 firms, the
laboratory contains exhibits rang
| ing from indoor and outdoor build
! ing materials to various tppes of
desks and tables.
Among unique features of the
laboratory is a model classroom,
J built on a scale of three inches to
: the foot and equipped with day
i light diffusing prismatic glass
J blocks, in which lighting and color
1 problems can be studied.
One of the laboratory's five rooms
| contains six built-in experimental
| units that demonstrate color, light
! ing, heating, and ventilation in var
| ious forms. Another exhibit is a
I $t>,ooo cut-away model of a heating
and ventilation unit, which actually
operates beneath a plexiglass cov
ering.
Still another unusual feature of
the displays is a new type of light
ing installation in which fluorescent
tubes are used above a ceiling of
frosted glass. The Stanford School
Plant Planning Laboratory is the
first to demonstrate this new meth
od of illumination west of the Mis
j sissippi.
Dr. James D. MacConnell, direc
| tor of the laboratory and associate
; dean of the> Stanford School of Ed
ucation, said the unique laboratory
will have a two-fold purpose.
1. To demonstrate visually mate
rials and fixtures available today to
solve problems of school construc
tion— problems faced in unprece
dented volume by school officials
and teachers, school board mem
bers, builders, architects, FT A
leaders, and the average citizen—
J the man who pays the bills.
2. To provide a work area of con
tinuing school building research and
"live" experimentation for school
administrators and future school of
ficials studying in the School of Ed
ucation.
The laboratory, unique in the
country in its scope, will tie into
the School Consultation Service
conducted by the Stanford School
i of Education.

Still another unusual feature of
the displays is a new type of light
ing installation in which fluorescent
tubes are used above a ceiling of
frosted glass. The Stanford School
Plant Planning Laboratory is the
first to demonstrate this new meth
od of illumination west of the Mis
j sissippi.
Dr. James D. MacConnell, direc
| tor of the laboratory and associate
; dean of the> Stanford School of Ed
ucation, said the unique laboratory
will have a two-fold purpose.
1. To demonstrate visually mate
rials and fixtures available today to
solve problems of school construc
tion— problems faced in unprece
dented volume by school officials
and teachers, school board mem
bers, builders, architects, FT A
leaders, and the average citizen—
J the man who pays the bills.
2. To provide a work area of con
tinuing school building research and
"live" experimentation for school
administrators and future school of
ficials studying in the School of Ed
ucation.
The laboratory, unique in the
country in its scope, will tie into
the School Consultation Service
conducted by the Stanford School
i of Education.
Stanford opened a new laboratory Wednesday, containing $70,-
000 worth of what every young school superintendent should
know.
The laboratory, housing the latest in school building equipment,
both standard and experimental, and model displays of almost
every type of building materials, is housed in the basement of the

I Stanford School of Education.
1 More than 400 school officials, ar-
I chitects, and builders were given a
I preview of the new laboratory as a
| feature of the School of Education's
] Annual Conference on School Plan
ning, which will conclude its five
| day program today.
Two years in the planning stage,
i and made possible through the co
poeration of more than 60 firms, the
laboratory contains exhibits rang
| ing from indoor and outdoor build
! ing materials to various tppes of
desks and tables.
Among unique features of the
laboratory is a model classroom,
J built on a scale of three inches to
: the foot and equipped with day
i light diffusing prismatic glass
J blocks, in which lighting and color
1 problems can be studied.
One of the laboratory's five rooms
| contains six built-in experimental
| units that demonstrate color, light
! ing, heating, and ventilation in var
| ious forms. Another exhibit is a
I $t>,ooo cut-away model of a heating
and ventilation unit, which actually
operates beneath a plexiglass cov
ering.
