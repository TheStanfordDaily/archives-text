## Time Out... 
### 
The San Francisco '49ers have a little situation this year that's as in
teresting as a well-constructed blonde with a new convertible. It's a thing
that restores your faith in the old values of life and makes you feel all
warm and good inside. (The situation, not the blonde.)
Just when it began to look like that trunk full of gold at home wouldn't
buy anything but a Kansas City election or a couple of basketball players,
come.-, news that some of die finer things in life can still be had for a
parcel of greenbacks. (Still not the blonde.)
MONKV CAN UK HKAUTIFUI* TOO
The ordinary, unimaginative pro football lineman takes a pretty un
• ■sthetic approach to the size ol his paycheck. He just counts tlu> lump.s
iiDin last year, multiplies by 1,000, and sticks a dollar sign in front of the
answer. But one of the '49ers' cleat-eaters went at the thing more ar
tistically this year.
And in so doing, ho makes you wonder if football's platoon system
isn't likely to be nestling in the nearest ashcan soon. Let's face it. If the
double standard won't work in the boudoir, how long will it last in the
end zone?
The gentleman with the ethereal soul is '49er guard Bruno Bandueci,
who was a charter member of Stanford's 1940 Rose Bowl team. Bruno
hasn't come up with any ordinary old "1 want more money." He's got an
approach as different as a Cactus Garden Romeo wtih boxing gloves on.

Bunducci doesn't know if he wants more money or
not—not until he finds out what his duties in the '49er
Jine are going to be this year. He wants to know if
he's going to play offense or defense. So what's the
difference, you say? So $1,500 difference, says Bruno.
He sees it this way:
You're an offensive guard and you work up a big
sweat knocking down linebackers alb day. So the
radio announcer tells the world about the beautiful
running of some anemic halfback. But you go on de
fense and make just one tackle, and he'll drool all
over the microphone calling you the greatest one-man
gang since Daniel racked up a couple of lions.

HUKK'S WHAT MONEY ISN'T
There is an nbvious discrepancy here, .says Bruno. And discrepancies
aren't coining cheap this year. Not that Banducci is an unusually vain
sort ot guy who just wants people blabbing his name all the time. He
doesn t even take a portable radio out on the field with him.
But Bruno is a business man in the off-season. And he figures if people
hear his name enough, they'll remember it -even if they can't spell it.
So Banducci feels that if he's going to be shuffled off to the oblivion of
an offensive lineman, he's got to have more loot.
Bruno has just taken a load off the Price Stabilization Board. He's
already set the ceiling price on a season's football glory at $1,500. And
it's encouraging to see that some people are still willing to rise about the
everyday, mundane uses for money. It's nice to know that a well
wrapped bundle of fame still has a price tag on it.
Because it's just like I was telling Ava the other night while Sinatra
was taking his bullfighting lesson. Fame and love are just alike. And-the
best things in life still aren't free. But the supply is going to catch up
with the demand any day now.
