Your reporter had his television debut the other week. It was on Tom
Harmon's Sports Quiz program over a local channel. The show is set up '
so that there are three experts competing against three benchwarmers to
see which team can come up with the most answers. Regular experts are
Yicki Braves, Olympic diving champ, and Kube Samuelsen, top-flight
.sports editor and syndicated columnist. The third expert is always a big- !
name spurts figure.
The three benchwarmers consist of eager sports fans. And the scrub j
that scores the most points lor the benchwarmers gets invited back to
defend his quiz-answering title. Through some pull. I managed to get
on the show. And the strangest thing was that the Stanford name was
held high, as 1 managed to come oft' top dog for three successive shows.
This is all sort of a lead-up to how I happened to meet Al Pollard, j
great Army hack, and got a chance to swap some grid yarns with the
Shining Black Knight. Al. on furlough from his rugged grind at West
Point, was the guest expert on the Harmon show last week.
Some of the things Pollard had to say bear repeating. First oil. he
couldn't rightly say what he thought of our Big Red Machine. He said
their 7-0 win in the mud was a hard battle, but under such conditions it
was really unfair to judge the relative ability of the teams.
In rating our brand of football as played on the Pacific Coast with the
Eastern stuff, Pollard said there was considrable difference. Back East,
"the play is much more rugged and you have to be in better physical
shape." And Al should know, for he played with Loyola for a season
before retreating to the Point.
Comparing current Army quarterback Bobby Blaik with Ail-Ameri
can Arnold (ialifTa, he offered that "Bob is a better faker and hands (lie
ball off better, but Galiffa was by far the more accurate passer." I then
complained about the beauty Blaik rifled to Foldberg for the only tally j
oi that muddy day against the Indians. He remembered that one, and
idmitted it was letter perfect.
About the Farm's pride and joy, big Bill McColl, the flashv Army back
had nothing but praise. Rates him alx>ut the best end he's ever come up
igainst. "And 1 should know," Al continued, "because we played opposite
each other and I was supposed to take him out on most of our running
plays. After each whistle blew, I'd l>e sitting in the mud staring up at
him or trying to find out where he had gone.
' He's mighty big and strong. And he gets in on every play." Such j
praise coming from a guy who is tubbed for sure All-Eastern honors and a
definite probable lor the All-American accolades is a nice press notice |
for our own McColl.
