# Soviet Views on International Law Told
## 
### 
The Russians, far from being
; lawless, have worked incessantly to '
j build up certain principles of inter- j
| national law, Dr. John N. Hazard j
I told a large Tuesday Evening Se- I
\ l ies audience at the Memorial Au- '
i ditorium last Tuesday.
Dr. Hazard, a leading authority |
on Soviet law and a visiting proles- I
sor at Stanford this summer, ap
proached the subject through the
evaluation of legal writings by So
j viet scholars. He pointed out that
views on international law put for
ward by Soviet professors are in- '
dicative of the official views.
While the Soviet leaders have not
rejected international law, they
have put into practice a process of
[ selection, he said.
They consider international law

. an instrumentality of government, ;
and thus have rejected those por
' tions of international law which are
J not useful to them.
An example of thler policy is
! their conception of aggressive war, ;
he said. The Soviet government has j
| spent a long time building up the i
| principle that the marching of an
official army across the frontiers of
another nation constitutes a viola- !
tion of international law.
At the same time, it has worked
equally hard to establish a second I

principle, that the aiding of armed
I bands in a civil war is not
.
i sum.
In the case or the Korean war,
I Russia has applied the second prin
ciple. As far as she is concerned,
i the Chinese troops are volunteer*
and not an official army.
At the same time, It is also eon
! cerned with the safety of the Kiti
| sian borders, and thus wishes to
j brand the crossing of her frontiers
i by any official army as aggression
