# Truman Claims Korea Saved UN
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, July 26 (UP) â€”
President Truman said today the
fight against Communist aggression
in Korea saved the United Nations
horn destruction and probably
headed off a third World War.
He defended the Korean action,
which has cost nearly 20,000 Ameri
can casualties, in a special report to
Congress on this country's role in
United Nations activities during
1950. The report, required by law,
was written prior to the current ar
mistice talks.
Most of the 429-page document
was a detailed history, prepared by
the State Department, of the Ko
rean fighting and UN debates and
jctions through Dec. 31, 1950.
In a five-page foreword, Mr. Tru
man told Congress that the record
shows the UN decision to fight in
Korea "has given pause" to the
"barbarous forces" of Communist
aggression.
One significant passage of the
general report was a statement that
the U.S. proposal for international
control of atomic energy "still re
mains in the forefront of our for
eign policy."
