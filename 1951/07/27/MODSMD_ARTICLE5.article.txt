# STANDARD HOUR
## Boston 'Pops' Coming Here 
### 
The Standard Hour will be broad
cast from Stanford's Memorial Hall
Sunday evening, Aug. 12.
Arthur Fiedler, director of the
Boston "Pops," will conduct the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
the hour-long NBC program. Pian
ist Garson Yessin will be featured
soloist.
Admission to the broadcast .will
be by ticket only.
Because the concert is being
brought to the campus as an extra
curricular cultural event, tickets
will be distributed to students and
other persons directly associated
with Stanford from 9 a.m. to noon
and from 1 to 5 p.m. Friday, Aug. 3.
If any tickets should remain after
the demand for them on the campus
has been met, they will be distrib
uted at a later date to the general
public.
Tlie Committee on Public Exer
cises, mindful of the disappointment
caused those who were unable to ob
tain tickets to the Standard Hour
concert at Stanford last year, has
outlined this simplified procedure:
1. Students may each obtain two
tickets by presenting student body
cards to those in charge of the Stand
ard Hour desk, which will be located
just outside the Office of Public Ex
ercises on the Inner Quad. Student
body cards will be punched.
2. Members of the faculty and staff
may also call for their tickets during
the same hours. The number of
tickets wil lalso be limited to two per
person. Names of persons calling for
tickets to the broadcast will be
checked off in the University Direc
tory.
3. Tickets will not be distributed
by mail.
