ited several collections of short sto
ries.

torian and editor. Dean Mott has

field of radio, llis collection of
extracts from great American bi
ographies, "A Gallery of Ameri
cans," will be dramatized and
aired in a series of 12 broadcasts
on New York's WNEYV starting in

able in a pocket edition, runs the
in subject matter from
Pocahontas' Captain John Smith
to Detroit's Joe Louis.
In 1946, Dean Mott published a
book on tonight's subject called
"Golden Multitudes: The Story of
Best Sellers in the United States."
He defines a best seller as a work

per cent of the nation's population.

this category over the past three
centuries. But with the rapid jump
in population, Dean Mott points out,
it lias become increasingly difficult
to make the select list.
In his study of almost ,'JOO years
of best sellers, Ik'an Mott has
found no formula for building a
better literary mouse-trap. 11 le
elements that may lead to a
book's popularity are too varied
to fit into a blueprint I'or success,
says Dean Mott. lie will discuss
the many different approaches to
the best-seller list tonight.
Aside from sexy covers, which
are a relatively modern device,
Dean Mott finds that the subjects
most prominent in best sellers have
been religion, self-help and advice,
history, and adventure. But popu
larity has proven very fickle. It has
smiled on everything from Shake
speare to "Ten Nights in a Bar
room."
Dean Mott's undergraduate
work was done at the University
of Chicago. He took his advanced
degrees at Columbia University.
He taught at Boston and Temple
Universities, and was director of
the School of Journalism at lowa

this category over the past three
centuries. But with the rapid jump
in population, Dean Mott points out,

of best sellers, Ik'an Mott has
found no formula for building a
better literary mouse-trap. 11 le
elements that may lead to a
book's popularity are too varied
to fit into a blueprint I'or success,
says Dean Mott. lie will discuss
the many different approaches to
the best-seller list tonight.

Dean Mott finds that the subjects
most prominent in best sellers have
been religion, self-help and advice,
history, and adventure. But popu
larity has proven very fickle. It has
smiled on everything from Shake
speare to "Ten Nights in a Bar
room."
