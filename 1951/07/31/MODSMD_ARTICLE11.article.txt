# Vocations—Do Bluebooks Lead to Greenbacks?

### CHUCK THOMAS 
Don't start jumping off bridges
every time someone tells you that
English majors make great gas sta
tion attendants, and that an A.B.
in econ practically guarantees you
a job as a bookie. At the Vocational
Guidance and Placement Service,
Stanford has a dozen people and
thousands of dollars working right
now to make it possible for you to
get the job you want. And the cost
to you is just one dollar for regis
tration.
The history of the Placement
Service goes back to 1915, when it
was an appointment service for
teachers under the School of Edu
cation. About 1930 it was expanded
to include other fields of study and
placed under the Office of the Reg
istrar. Then in 1946, the service first
appeared as it looks today—a co
ordination of the placement agen
cies of almost all University depart
ments under the Dean of Students.
The service has two main pur-
One us to provide vocational

advice to students who haven't
really tacked their ambitions down
yet. The other is to play cupid be- I
| tween students and prospective em
ployers.
By playing lx>th ends against the
! middle this way, the service suc
ceeds in selling employers on Stan
ford graduates, and in selling Stan
! ford to prospective students. And
| through follow - up surveys , the |
University can find out if blue- !
books really give birth to green- j
1 backs.
Eugene V. Dils, director of the j
Placement Service, emphasizes that j
registration should not be the last
resort before going on relief. Last i
I year almost lO.(XH) jobs were listed '
with the service, and nearly 1,400 '
of the 3,200 active registrants were
placed in jobs of their choice. Looks
like the Placement Service is the
only place west of Reno where one
buck can make you a million.
Don't stay away from the service j
just because your prospective fa- ■
, ther-in-law may own a few distil—
I leriei, either Prohibition may come

• back any day now. And about half
j the placement work done at the
I service concerns graduates who are
changing jobs alter leaving Stan
ford.
Stanford Associates and other
alumni groups conduct a vigorous,
year-round program to sell busi
ness and industry on Stanford grad
uates. Last year alone, over $1,700
I was spent to interest prospective
I employers in listing their job open-
I ings with the Placement Service.
Students should complete 12
i quarters of work at Stanford before
registering. But interviews and let
ters of recommendation are part of
the registration procedure, so about
two quarters before graduation is
the ideal time to drop in at Build
ing 1, Inner Quad.
Just a word of caution to the
girls, though. Please, when you
, register, request something simple
! like trapeze artist or movie star. Mr.
i Dils doesn't have the staff or the
1 facilities to get involved with all
the girls who want placement js
housewives.

Eugene V. Dils, director of the j

registration should not be the last

I year almost lO.(XH) jobs were listed '
with the service, and nearly 1,400 '
of the 3,200 active registrants were
placed in jobs of their choice. Looks
like the Placement Service is the
only place west of Reno where one
buck can make you a million.
Don't stay away from the service j
just because your prospective fa- ■

I leriei, either Prohibition may come

j the placement work done at the
I service concerns graduates who are
changing jobs alter leaving Stan
ford.
Stanford Associates and other

I ings with the Placement Service.
Students should complete 12
i quarters of work at Stanford before
registering. But interviews and let
ters of recommendation are part of
the registration procedure, so about
two quarters before graduation is
the ideal time to drop in at Build
ing 1, Inner Quad.
Just a word of caution to the
girls, though. Please, when you
, register, request something simple
! like trapeze artist or movie star. Mr.
i Dils doesn't have the staff or the
1 facilities to get involved with all
the girls who want placement js
housewives.
Don't start jumping off bridges
every time someone tells you that
English majors make great gas sta
tion attendants, and that an A.B.
in econ practically guarantees you
a job as a bookie. At the Vocational
Guidance and Placement Service,
Stanford has a dozen people and
thousands of dollars working right
now to make it possible for you to
get the job you want. And the cost
to you is just one dollar for regis
tration.
The history of the Placement
Service goes back to 1915, when it
was an appointment service for
teachers under the School of Edu
cation. About 1930 it was expanded
to include other fields of study and
placed under the Office of the Reg
istrar. Then in 1946, the service first
appeared as it looks today—a co
ordination of the placement agen
cies of almost all University depart
ments under the Dean of Students.
