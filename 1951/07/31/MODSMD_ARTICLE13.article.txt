# BULL SESSION
## "I WAS A CHINESE RED" 
### David Wong 
"Oh, plea-s-e-e! Don't get excited! This is not my idea, I assure
you. It all started very innocently. All I did was to complain to
a friend of mine (I do have a friend) that the high cost of an edu- !
cation had, figuratively speaking, put me in the red.
"Don't let that worry you," he counseled. "In this land of pri
vate initiative, free enterprise, and rugged individualism, there are
always ways of making an honest dollar."
"Yes, but how?" I replied.
"Oh, any number of things." my friend said. "Why not write
a book? Everybody writes books these days, even those who
have nothing to say.".
'On whaf?" I was still unconvinced as to the value of his ad
vice.
'Something sensational, of course. How about something like
'J Was a Chinese Red'?"
"But that's not true!" I exclaimed.
"Don't be too particular." My friend was getting annoyed. J
"What do you think -we have freedom of the press for? Fiction ;
writers make good money writing about things that never hap- j
pened at all, so why can't you stretch the facts a little? After all,
you are a Chinese, aren't you?"
"Yes," I admitted. "But there are some Senators around who
can be pretty unreasonable about such things."
'That's just part of the democratic tradition," my friend said. |
"Only unreasonable men get to be Senators."
By then I was just about convinced of the beauties of democ
racy, free enterprise, and so forth. "Just one more thing," I said.
"How do I know my book will sell?"
Well, write a Bull Session in The Daily under that title, and
if a loyalty oath is instituted at Stanford after that your book is
bound to be a best-seller."
What if nothing happens?"
Then you change the title to 'I Am a Chinese Red' and start all
over again." %
