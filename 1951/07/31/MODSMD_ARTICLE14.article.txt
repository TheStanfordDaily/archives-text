AN IMPROPER BOSTONIAN
I like it in Boston. Except for one thing.
1 like it, because it is the urban center of lovely New England.
1 like it, because it is quaint and charming and reeks with tradi
tion. In fact, I knew I had arrived in Boston and New England when
I saw a sign saying "Cranston's Grille and Shoppe—Careful,
Wette Painte." Yes, I like it in Boston.
Except for one thing.
That one thing is that Bostonians refuse to accept the styles of
the time. Specifically, I refer to a Hawaiian shirt I wore, the color
of a three-day-old bruise—with every color of the rainbow thrown
in, plus a few colors that aren't in the rainbow. It's accepted as a
matter of course in the West, but in Boston it raised eyebrows.
I first learned that a wild shirt is frowned upon while walking
down Commonwealth Avenue. Griff faltered farther and farther
behind.
"What are you doing way back there?" I inquired.
"I don't know you," was the answer. "Look at all the stares
you're getting."
Maisie May, who goes to Stanford three quarters of the year
and goes to Boston University the fourth, was our unofficial guide
in Boston. And I leaned over and asked her what Bostonians
thought of a shirt the color of an Easter egg. She whispered that
it didn't draw the same response that it does in the West.
Later, at the Bunker Hill Monument! we came across an English
man who was quite a character. A guide announced that such
and-such an English general fell at Bunker Hill. The Englishman
looked down the embankment and iemarked, "By George, a nasty
fall, wasn't it?"
Then the Englishman's eyes fell on my explosive raiment, and
he gasped in horror. Several other proper Bostonians who were
near followed suit. "Where did you get that?" sputtered one.
In California."
No wonder . . . way out West," was the contemptuous reply.
I allowed as to how most of the Indian tribes had been cleaned
out back West and that we had heard something of discoveries
by Marconi, Bell, and Edison. I left them standing there, their
mouths still open in sheer amazement. And as I said, I like it in
Boston.

"I don't know you," was the answer. "Look at all the stares
you're getting."
Maisie May, who goes to Stanford three quarters of the year
and goes to Boston University the fourth, was our unofficial guide
in Boston. And I leaned over and asked her what Bostonians
thought of a shirt the color of an Easter egg. She whispered that
it didn't draw the same response that it does in the West.
Later, at the Bunker Hill Monument! we came across an English
man who was quite a character. A guide announced that such
and-such an English general fell at Bunker Hill. The Englishman
looked down the embankment and iemarked, "By George, a nasty
fall, wasn't it?"
Then the Englishman's eyes fell on my explosive raiment, and
he gasped in horror. Several other proper Bostonians who were
near followed suit. "Where did you get that?" sputtered one.
In California."
No wonder . . . way out West," was the contemptuous reply.
I allowed as to how most of the Indian tribes had been cleaned
out back West and that we had heard something of discoveries
by Marconi, Bell, and Edison. I left them standing there, their
mouths still open in sheer amazement. And as I said, I like it in
Boston.
Except for one thing.
