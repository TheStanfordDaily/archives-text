# PRO AND CAHN
## 
### 
I have avoided a discussion of major league baseball. Many of you put
off reading this column. But for lack of something better to do, you read
it, just as I. for the lack of something better to do, shall scribble today
on who's going to win the American League flag. I concede the National
League pennant to the Dodgers, who are out in front and winging along.
Lo gically it looks like a three-, possibly four-team race, right down to
the wire. Chicago is slipping and pretty far gone, but they have come
back belore and might do it again, although trailing by six and one-half
games as of yesterday. The White Sox are just about everyone's senti
mental favorites.
Cleveland has come fast. Good pitching and good hitting has brought
them a long way. However, I believe the duration of their success is ques
tionable.
Boston, always at the church but never a bride, is in a choice position
to wed herself to the pennant this time around. It all depends upon the
continued unexpected clutch batting of Clyde Vollmer, pitching which
is better than ever, and spirit which is always a Ked Sox weakness.
The perennial champs, New York, are picked by many to cop another
flag. The old Yankee pros are their strongest in the September stretch,
but one of these years, perhaps this one, DiMaggio, Mize, Rizzuto, and the
old-timers will burn out in late August and the Yanks will be through.
There's no getting ai'ound it, the American League race is as tight as
grandpappy on Saturday night.
From the standings now there is no logical choice. No choice at all.
It could go any of four ways. Wishing not to forecast the winner without
any basis for decision, I asked a fair young princess what her choice was.
She liked the Yankees, even money. I like them too. So there it is, the
New York Yankees lo cop the American League llag. At least I have
woman's intuition as some-basis for a prognostication that may seem
very rash come October.
Pen» Conforms, Cal Loses Money
I would like to bet that the University of California, our Berkeley
neighbor, is madder than a beaver with a toothache about Pennsylvania
conforming to the NCAA ban on telecasts. Previouslp the Bears were all
$et to take their share of the $250,000 for which Penn had sold her TV
rights. California, being on the Eastern school's home sked, would have
partaken of some of the loot, but now that Penn has conformed, and will
have no telecasts, the Bears are that much poorer, and perhaps might be
without a good halfback.
Sorry, Gary, No Frosli Football
The current issue of Life states that Gary Crosby, Bing's boy, is Stan
lord bound -come fall. Life points out that Gary's immediate ambition is
to make the Stanford freshman football team. It should be made clear
that Stanford will have no frosh teams of any nature starting this fall.
All making the mistake of wanting to play frosh ball had better raise
their aspirations to at least a junior varsity level.
Caught the Forty-Niners at work Saturday afternoon up at Menlo.
The scrimmages are rock and sock. The rookies are fighting, and fighting
is a mild word, to secure a place with the play-for-pay boys. And the
regulars are fighting just as hard to stay with the team. Would not doubt
that the pre-season scrimmages are harder fought than many of the league
games.
The linemen are not the ordinary college dehydrated size. These boys
are big. Those under 200 pounds are thrown back in the sea. Two hun
dred thirty pounds is the rule rather than the exception.
It's really an afternoon's entertainment to watch pros. Try it some
time. Gives you new ideas about football.
How s This for a Threat, Mr. Leiser
Good to see Bill Leiser back on the iob after a serious illness. In his
Sunday column in the Chronicle, the Stanford graduate states that he
was personally exhausted following his coaching experience in a Stan
lord practice game last spring that ended tied. And that his trouble might
have been the ailment common to all football coaches, abdominal suffering.
Leiser resolves that he shall never again attempt to coach any part of
a football game, except with medical attention close at hand.
But may I warn you, Mr. Leiser. to be ready to fill Stanford's head
coaching position at any time? I hear that Stanford's southern alumni are
already on Chuck Taylor. After all, he has been here since April and
hasn't won a game.

New York Yankees lo cop the American League llag. At least I have
woman's intuition as some-basis for a prognostication that may seem
very rash come October.
Pen» Conforms, Cal Loses Money
I would like to bet that the University of California, our Berkeley
neighbor, is madder than a beaver with a toothache about Pennsylvania
conforming to the NCAA ban on telecasts. Previouslp the Bears were all
$et to take their share of the $250,000 for which Penn had sold her TV
rights. California, being on the Eastern school's home sked, would have
partaken of some of the loot, but now that Penn has conformed, and will
have no telecasts, the Bears are that much poorer, and perhaps might be
without a good halfback.
Sorry, Gary, No Frosli Football
The current issue of Life states that Gary Crosby, Bing's boy, is Stan
lord bound -come fall. Life points out that Gary's immediate ambition is
to make the Stanford freshman football team. It should be made clear
that Stanford will have no frosh teams of any nature starting this fall.
All making the mistake of wanting to play frosh ball had better raise
their aspirations to at least a junior varsity level.
Caught the Forty-Niners at work Saturday afternoon up at Menlo.
The scrimmages are rock and sock. The rookies are fighting, and fighting
is a mild word, to secure a place with the play-for-pay boys. And the
regulars are fighting just as hard to stay with the team. Would not doubt
that the pre-season scrimmages are harder fought than many of the league
games.
The linemen are not the ordinary college dehydrated size. These boys
are big. Those under 200 pounds are thrown back in the sea. Two hun
dred thirty pounds is the rule rather than the exception.
It's really an afternoon's entertainment to watch pros. Try it some
time. Gives you new ideas about football.
How s This for a Threat, Mr. Leiser
Good to see Bill Leiser back on the iob after a serious illness. In his
Sunday column in the Chronicle, the Stanford graduate states that he
was personally exhausted following his coaching experience in a Stan
lord practice game last spring that ended tied. And that his trouble might
have been the ailment common to all football coaches, abdominal suffering.
Leiser resolves that he shall never again attempt to coach any part of
a football game, except with medical attention close at hand.
But may I warn you, Mr. Leiser. to be ready to fill Stanford's head
coaching position at any time? I hear that Stanford's southern alumni are
already on Chuck Taylor. After all, he has been here since April and
hasn't won a game.
I have avoided a discussion of major league baseball. Many of you put
off reading this column. But for lack of something better to do, you read
it, just as I. for the lack of something better to do, shall scribble today
on who's going to win the American League flag. I concede the National
League pennant to the Dodgers, who are out in front and winging along.
Lo gically it looks like a three-, possibly four-team race, right down to
the wire. Chicago is slipping and pretty far gone, but they have come
back belore and might do it again, although trailing by six and one-half
games as of yesterday. The White Sox are just about everyone's senti
mental favorites.
Cleveland has come fast. Good pitching and good hitting has brought
them a long way. However, I believe the duration of their success is ques
tionable.
Boston, always at the church but never a bride, is in a choice position
to wed herself to the pennant this time around. It all depends upon the
continued unexpected clutch batting of Clyde Vollmer, pitching which
is better than ever, and spirit which is always a Ked Sox weakness.
The perennial champs, New York, are picked by many to cop another
flag. The old Yankee pros are their strongest in the September stretch,
but one of these years, perhaps this one, DiMaggio, Mize, Rizzuto, and the
old-timers will burn out in late August and the Yanks will be through.
There's no getting ai'ound it, the American League race is as tight as
grandpappy on Saturday night.
From the standings now there is no logical choice. No choice at all.
It could go any of four ways. Wishing not to forecast the winner without
any basis for decision, I asked a fair young princess what her choice was.
She liked the Yankees, even money. I like them too. So there it is, the
New York Yankees lo cop the American League llag. At least I have

dred thirty pounds is the rule rather than the exception.
It's really an afternoon's entertainment to watch pros. Try it some
time. Gives you new ideas about football.
How s This for a Threat, Mr. Leiser
Good to see Bill Leiser back on the iob after a serious illness. In his
Sunday column in the Chronicle, the Stanford graduate states that he
was personally exhausted following his coaching experience in a Stan
lord practice game last spring that ended tied. And that his trouble might
have been the ailment common to all football coaches, abdominal suffering.
Leiser resolves that he shall never again attempt to coach any part of
a football game, except with medical attention close at hand.
But may I warn you, Mr. Leiser. to be ready to fill Stanford's head
coaching position at any time? I hear that Stanford's southern alumni are
already on Chuck Taylor. After all, he has been here since April and
hasn't won a game.
