# Some Guys Can't Win for Winning

### CHUCK THOMAS 
Save all those tears for Marchie
Schwartz and Jeff Cravath and the
i other football coaches whose only
problem was they didn't build a
winning team. If anybody has. a
good sniffle coming, it's the basket
ball coaches like Nat Holman,
Claire Bee, and Fordy Anderson—
whose trouble lay in building teams
that were just too good, and are
now mixed up in the cage scandal.
Take Anderson, for instance. As
, a player, Fordy came to Stanford
in 1940 with a reputation built in
junior'college basketball. He moved
I right into a starting forward spot
on Coach Everett Dean's strong
cage squad. Then in 1941, Ander
i son sparked the Indian team that
swept to the Southern Division title

and was named All-Coast.
As a coach, his rise to tame was
even more spectacular.
The Braiiiey teams he sent
against Stanford in the Pavilion in
1949 and in the Cow Palace in 1951
were well-coached, superbly condi
tioned squads.
Anderson's Bradley teams won 91
out of 110 games. That record made
Anderson and Bradley famous. And
kept the fixers hanging around the
i shower-rooms.
It looks like a football coach has
got it made. All he h*s to do is win.
But a basketball coach can't win —
even if he does.
