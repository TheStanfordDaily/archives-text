# Buffer Zone Dispute
## 
### 

CONFERENCE AIMS —Map above shows problem now under
discussion at Kaesong peace conference. The Communists are
known to want a 10-kilometer (6'/4-mile) "buffer zone" some
where along the 38th parallel, which would force a UN with
drawal of up to 20 miles. The UN is expected to seek a cease
file line more related to the current battle line. The present line,
anchored along a chain of mountains and the shortest distance
across the peninsula, offers UN forces a line easier to defend
than the 38th parallel. —Acme Telephoto
