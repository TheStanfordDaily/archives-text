# 'Balladeers' Will Sing Here Tomorrow
## Program Includes African Chants 
### 
America's foremost balladcers,
Muiais and Miranda, will appear
tomorrow evening at 8:15 in Stan
ford Memorial Hall.
They will sing a program of 21
folk songs and ballads — some of
them from Marais' native South Af
rica, such as their signature song,
"Sarie Marais," which grew out of
the Boer War encampments, and
others from Germany, Switzerland,
England, France, and America'.
Marais and Mirandk's final num
ber, the South African "Sugar
bush," is one that their admirers
will be particularly glad to hear.
This dance tune is punctuated with
a rhythmic phrase clapped with the
hands or stamped with the feet that
soon has the audience tapping feet
at the appropriate times.
Since Marais and Miranda ap
peared at Stanford two years ago,
they have made two nation-wide
concert tours and appeared on
countless radio and television
shows.
Tickets to the Stanford recital
may be purchased at Memorial Hall
box office, at the Peninsula Box Of
fice in Palo Alto and San Mateo,
and at the door on the evening of
the performance for $1.20.
