# Americans Read Well, Egyptians Backwards
## 
### MYRON NEWMAN 
As your eye scans this line, you
are probably not conscious that you
are reading from left to right. If
you were to take up Egyptian, how
ever. you would become acutely
conscious of this problem.
In the first place, when you
piclted up the Egyptian book you
would discover that the "front" of
the book is the "back" of the book.
And if that didn't confuse you
enough, you would soon discover
that Egyptians read from right to
left across the line.
Visiting Professor William S.
Gray, noted reading authority from
the University of Chicago, who is
teaching at Stanford this summer,
learned of these facts first - hand
when he visited Egypt in 1949 to
study illiteracy and reading.
Dr. Gray began his career in
when he started teaching in
a rural school in Adams County,
Illinois.
Since that time, he has occu
pied virtually every rung on the
teaching ladder until he is now
reading director and professor of
education at the University . of
Chicago.
In 1937 Dr. Gray went to Puerto
Rico to study the bilingual prob
lem. He believes the reading def.-
cieneies in that country are chiefly
due to the imposition of English
upon a Spanish-speaking country.
These difficulties are now being
overcome, according to Dr. Gray.
Althoivfh the three "R's" are
under fire today. Dr. Gray cm*
phasizes that American school
children at any given ai;e or
grade level have never been able
to read as we'! as they can to<!a>.
He pointed out, however, tint our
reading ability may appear some -

what worse than it actually is. This |
is true because the demand upon '
reading has increased more rapidly
than reading skills have been de
veloped.
Radio and television may have
contributed to this effect, he added. I
These two nudia have largely taken ,
place of reading as u leisure
activity.
As a result, rea iing has been used
.'or more *.*rii>us activities requiring ,

| greater depth of interpretation.
In addition to many monographs,
Dr. Gray is the author of "Reading
Interests and Habits of Adults,"
"What Makes a Book Readable,"
"Reading in General Education,"
I and "On Their Own in Reading."
When Dr. Gray has finished his
summer teaching here at Stanford,
! he is planning to take a fishing trip
in the Trinity River country of
. Northern Califoro

PROFESSOR WILLIAM S. GRAY—Visiting authority on reading
As your eye scans this line, you
are probably not conscious that you
are reading from left to right. If
you were to take up Egyptian, how
ever. you would become acutely
conscious of this problem.
In the first place, when you
piclted up the Egyptian book you
would discover that the "front" of
the book is the "back" of the book.
And if that didn't confuse you
enough, you would soon discover
that Egyptians read from right to
left across the line.
Visiting Professor William S.
Gray, noted reading authority from
the University of Chicago, who is
teaching at Stanford this summer,
learned of these facts first - hand
when he visited Egypt in 1949 to
study illiteracy and reading.
Dr. Gray began his career in
when he started teaching in
a rural school in Adams County,
Illinois.
Since that time, he has occu
pied virtually every rung on the
teaching ladder until he is now
reading director and professor of
education at the University . of
Chicago.
In 1937 Dr. Gray went to Puerto
Rico to study the bilingual prob
lem. He believes the reading def.-
cieneies in that country are chiefly
due to the imposition of English
upon a Spanish-speaking country.
These difficulties are now being
overcome, according to Dr. Gray.
Althoivfh the three "R's" are
under fire today. Dr. Gray cm*
phasizes that American school
children at any given ai;e or
grade level have never been able
to read as we'! as they can to<!a>.
