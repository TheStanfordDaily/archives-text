FROM QUEBEC, CANADA
Quebec City is charming and quaint in the fullest meaning of
the word. Horse-drawn wagons clatter down its narrow cobble
stone greets, and it has the Old World atmosphere. But to enjoy
Quebec to its fullest, you have to know how to speak French.
I don't.
Unlike other parts of Canada, when you travel through the
Province of Quebec you have the distinct feeling that you are
in another country —if for no other reason than that no one speaks
English. All I know of French is what I saw in a Charles Boyer
picture once. Which is slightly less than adequate. He mumbled
something about "Come to the Casbah weeth me."
Oh, yes, a girl who flunked French at Stanford took me aside and
told me a few handy things to know, such as "Le chien est brun"
(the dog is brown) and "Le diner est sur la table" (the dinner is
on the table.)
But I found out these sentences weren't too useful, because no
one seemed to care whether a dog was brown or pink. Except
maybe a drunk. And to state in French that "Le diner est sur la
table," first I had to find out how much the dinner cost, and the
girl who flunked French didn't give me the proper tools for this.
I would advise the Stanford French Department to teach prac
tical things, such as "Ou est le jean?" (Where is the john?). This
is useful anywhere, whereas you can walk down the cobblestone
alleys of Quebec proudly announcing "The dog is brown" until
you are blue in the face, and no one will give you a second glance.
Not even a brown dog.
Poor Griff. He was sitting on a park bench, and a French girl
sat next to him and talked to him in French for 20 minutes before
she discovered he couldn't speak the language.
He couldn't even say, "The dog is brown."
