# 'Don't Knock Best Sellers'
## 
### 
Don't be contemptuous of a book
because it's a best seller, Frank L.
\Mott told a Tuesday Series audi-
Ance last Tuesday in Mem Aud.
Jr "When millions of people read
one book, that book is worthy of
our attention."
Dr. Mott, dean emeritus oJt jour
nalism at the University of Mis
souri, is the author of "Golden Mul
titudes: The Story of Best Sellers
in the United States." In his talk he
presented a roundup of his findings
in that work.
He said mass publication per
forms a public service, but it would
be unfortunate if we overempha
sized it and stopped publishing
worthwhile books that are neces
sary for the continuation of Amer
ican culture, but do not have mass
interest.
Although book sales have risen
over a period of years, he pointed
out that the number of books pub
lished has decreased.
We are not impressed by the sale
of a million copies of a book. Mott
said, and he noted that only eight
public libraries and only 11 uni
versities in the United States have
over a million books.
There is no formula for a best
seller, Mott said. Among elements
most prominent on best-seller lists,
e said, are religion* democracy,
sensationalism, self - improvement,
adventure, and characterization.
Almost 15 per cent of the best
sellers have been written by clergy
men, he said, and many best sellers
b.ave been at the top for years,
while Others die out quickly
