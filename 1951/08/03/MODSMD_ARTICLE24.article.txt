# CHUCK THOMAS
## Time Out... 
### 
While most baseball fans were busy stuffing their ballots for the All-
Star game in the box this summer, some more imaginative souls with post
cards to burn and nothing to do were whipping up a little contest of their
own. And they aren't voting their boy into anything as small-time as an
afternoon at third base. The winner, for the second time this year, al
ready, was the Yankees' young minor-league outfielder, Mickey Mantle.
It seems that Mantle has the questionable distinction of being the one
guy that the most people in this world would like to see spending the
summer in Korea. That's about as flattering as telling Ava Gardner she
ought to buy smaller sweaters.
MANTLE SINGLES, JUNIOR FIDDLES, WHILE DADDY BUKNS
Here's the picture. A bunch of mamas and daddies who gave their
little boys violin lessons while Papa Mantle was teaching young Mickey
how to hit a baseball, got all excited about Mantle getting so many pic
tures in the paper and stuffing so much gold in his pocket.
So they buy a half interest in the post office and start turning out
letters on a mass-production scale that would make any self-respecting

rabbit extremely jealous. The result of all this—be
sides a bunch of green-eyed rabbits—is that the post
office staff in Miami, Oklahoma, goes on overtime.
Now Miami, Oklahoma, is Mickey's home town.
But don't start kangarooing to conclusions. The mail
box at the Mantle residence was still growing cobwebs
between gas bills. Mickey's fan mail didn't, go to
Mickey. It went to his draft board.
How about this kid Mantle? the letters asked. He's
a ripe 20 years old and healthy enough to leg out an
infield single. Let's hand him a rifle and give him a
rie paddy to play hop-scotch in.

FIRST A SOLO, THEN AN ENCORE
So what happens? Mantle's draft board calls him back from New York
in April for a special solo physical. The kid's bones are about as strong
as second-day coffee, said the doctors—4F. Of course, there are probably
no more than a few thousand guys with the same bone disease Mantle
has—but they all took violin lessons and nobody writes headlines about
fiddlers.
So Mickey's draft board has to buy a bigger mail-box again. And
what else did they do? They announced this week that they are calling
Mantle down from Kansas City for an encore on that last physical.
But don't let's be too critical of Mantle's draft board or even the
patriotic souls who put the pressure on. They just may have something
here. When you stop to think about it, this is really the American ideal
going first class. Why, it's downright authoritarian to just pick numbers
out of fishbowls and then draft guys indiscriminately.
So instead, we'll just have everybody write a letter to the draft board
of someone they think would look real nice in khaki. The winner gets a
tree boat ride. What could be more democratic? Why, it's as American
as apple pie, the corner drugstore, and Margaret Truman in pigtails.
Well, time to get busy. Got to write a letter—to the draft board of the
guy that little blonde sophomore's pinned to.

rabbit extremely jealous. The result of all this—be
sides a bunch of green-eyed rabbits—is that the post
office staff in Miami, Oklahoma, goes on overtime.
Now Miami, Oklahoma, is Mickey's home town.
But don't start kangarooing to conclusions. The mail
box at the Mantle residence was still growing cobwebs
between gas bills. Mickey's fan mail didn't, go to
Mickey. It went to his draft board.
How about this kid Mantle? the letters asked. He's
a ripe 20 years old and healthy enough to leg out an
infield single. Let's hand him a rifle and give him a
rie paddy to play hop-scotch in.

FIRST A SOLO, THEN AN ENCORE
So what happens? Mantle's draft board calls him back from New York
in April for a special solo physical. The kid's bones are about as strong
as second-day coffee, said the doctors—4F. Of course, there are probably
no more than a few thousand guys with the same bone disease Mantle
has—but they all took violin lessons and nobody writes headlines about
fiddlers.
So Mickey's draft board has to buy a bigger mail-box again. And
what else did they do? They announced this week that they are calling
Mantle down from Kansas City for an encore on that last physical.
But don't let's be too critical of Mantle's draft board or even the
patriotic souls who put the pressure on. They just may have something
here. When you stop to think about it, this is really the American ideal
going first class. Why, it's downright authoritarian to just pick numbers
out of fishbowls and then draft guys indiscriminately.
So instead, we'll just have everybody write a letter to the draft board
of someone they think would look real nice in khaki. The winner gets a
tree boat ride. What could be more democratic? Why, it's as American
as apple pie, the corner drugstore, and Margaret Truman in pigtails.
Well, time to get busy. Got to write a letter—to the draft board of the
guy that little blonde sophomore's pinned to.

While most baseball fans were busy stuffing their ballots for the All-
Star game in the box this summer, some more imaginative souls with post
cards to burn and nothing to do were whipping up a little contest of their
own. And they aren't voting their boy into anything as small-time as an
afternoon at third base. The winner, for the second time this year, al
ready, was the Yankees' young minor-league outfielder, Mickey Mantle.
It seems that Mantle has the questionable distinction of being the one
guy that the most people in this world would like to see spending the
summer in Korea. That's about as flattering as telling Ava Gardner she
ought to buy smaller sweaters.
MANTLE SINGLES, JUNIOR FIDDLES, WHILE DADDY BUKNS
Here's the picture. A bunch of mamas and daddies who gave their
little boys violin lessons while Papa Mantle was teaching young Mickey
how to hit a baseball, got all excited about Mantle getting so many pic
tures in the paper and stuffing so much gold in his pocket.
So they buy a half interest in the post office and start turning out
letters on a mass-production scale that would make any self-respecting

rabbit extremely jealous. The result of all this—be
sides a bunch of green-eyed rabbits—is that the post
office staff in Miami, Oklahoma, goes on overtime.
