# Jackie Vows He'll Return
## 
### 
'Til be back."
This time it isn't General Mac-Ar
thur saying it, but Jackie Jensen,
upon his being sent to Kansas City
by the New York Yankees, mid
week.
Jensen was All - American full
back at California for three years,
and for three years he made Stan
ford football fans miserable. How
ever, Jensen was a bit on the down-

hearted side himself when informed
by Casey Stengel that he was being
optioned.
Although Jensen was - batting .29(5
for the league leaders, he was not
seeing enough action, according to
Stengel.
Jensen, although saw
the wisdom in the demotion, and
summed it up by saying, "At least
it'll give me a chance to play more
and that's what I need."
He follows rookie sensation Mick
ey Mantle, who was sent to Kansas
City last month.
