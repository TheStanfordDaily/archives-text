# Bells Have Had 'Temporary' Home Since 1915

### JIM BOGLE 
In an unpretentious building be
hind the Memorial Church is lo
cated the mechanism which controls
the routine for the entire Stanford
cmpus,
No larger than an ordinary alarm
clock, this timepiece regulates the
chimes, class bells, and the large
clock on the outside of the tower,
with near perfect accuracy.
Originally housed in the church
.spire, which was destroyed in the
earthquake of I9oti, the chimes and
th.' timepiece were unused until
15)15, when the trustees decided to
build a "temporary and simple
.structure, frankly utilitarian with
no attempt to render it architec
turally attractive."
lk-lls in "Temporary" Tower
The rebuilding of the church
spire was left to the indefinite fu
ture. There was some talk of in
stalling the he*lis in the new library
building, after it was built.
'Maybe the administration thought
th<> ringing every 15 minutes over
the heads of studying students
would be disturbing. The church
.spire was never rebuilt, and the
chimes remain in their "temporary"
structure to this day.
The chimes are electrically con
trolled by a complicated system of
cables and weights which drop
when the mechanism trips and
causes the hammers to strike the
bells.
Fod lt» years Mr. Stanley Shepard
has been oiling the works, rewind
ing the cable, and chasing an occa
siinal student marauder from the
tower.
Inscription on Tower
On the top of the tower, there are
four big brass bells hanging out in
the open. On the other side of the
tower, an inscription:
''Chimes of the Memorial Church
Krected to the memory of Lelaml
Stanford
I»\ his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford
A.D. 11)00"
The chimes were modeled after
the famous Westminster chimes in
tin- Victorian tower in the Houses

of Parliament in London. The mu
sic of the chimes is said to have
been composed by Handel.
On the landing where the clock is
kept, a mechanism which Shepard
invented himself electrically winds
the cable.
Battered Door
The chipped and battered door of
the tower stands as a witness to
many capricious undertakings. One
ingenious person managed to break
in and unscrew the four wheels
which control the himes and mix
them up, prescenting a rather en
tangling problem, for nobody could
remember which bar of the music
came first.
After much research, the chimes
were finally straightened out.

Now those students who desire to
do something daring scale Hoover
Tower instead.

with near perfect accuracy.
Originally housed in the church
.spire, which was destroyed in the
earthquake of I9oti, the chimes and
th.' timepiece were unused until
15)15, when the trustees decided to
build a "temporary and simple

no attempt to render it architec
turally attractive."
lk-lls in "Temporary" Tower
The rebuilding of the church
spire was left to the indefinite fu
ture. There was some talk of in
stalling the he*lis in the new library
building, after it was built.
'Maybe the administration thought
th<> ringing every 15 minutes over
the heads of studying students
would be disturbing. The church
.spire was never rebuilt, and the
chimes remain in their "temporary"
structure to this day.
The chimes are electrically con
trolled by a complicated system of
cables and weights which drop
when the mechanism trips and
causes the hammers to strike the
bells.
Fod lt» years Mr. Stanley Shepard
has been oiling the works, rewind
ing the cable, and chasing an occa
siinal student marauder from the
tower.
Inscription on Tower
On the top of the tower, there are
four big brass bells hanging out in
the open. On the other side of the
tower, an inscription:
''Chimes of the Memorial Church
Krected to the memory of Lelaml
Stanford
I»\ his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford
A.D. 11)00"
The chimes were modeled after
the famous Westminster chimes in
tin- Victorian tower in the Houses

of Parliament in London. The mu
sic of the chimes is said to have
been composed by Handel.
On the landing where the clock is
kept, a mechanism which Shepard
invented himself electrically winds
the cable.
Battered Door
The chipped and battered door of
the tower stands as a witness to
many capricious undertakings. One
ingenious person managed to break
in and unscrew the four wheels
which control the himes and mix
them up, prescenting a rather en
tangling problem, for nobody could
remember which bar of the music
came first.
After much research, the chimes
were finally straightened out.

Now those students who desire to
do something daring scale Hoover
Tower instead.
