STAMFORD SADIE SHOWS ALL — That bewitching, exciting
voice which has been frustrating Farm men for the past six
weeks belongs to Pat Haley, a Lagunita senior. Pat attends COP
regular session but is currently enrolled in the Stanford-NBC
Radio Institute. Sadie only has this to say, "Why don't you turn
the radio up louder, honey, so I can get closer to you?"— Photo
