WASHINGTON. Aug. 6 (UP) —
Russia proposed a four-point peace
program to the United States to
night to end the cold war, including
an anti-war pact among the five
powers.
Mainstays of the Kremlin's pro
gram were:
1. An anti-war pact among the
United States, Russia, Great Brit
ain, France, and China — meaning
Red China.
2. Prohibition of atomic weapons
backed by inspection to make sure
that nobody makes A-bombs se
cretly.
3. Limitation of armaments.
4. Elimination of U.S. "discrimi
nation" aaginst the Soviet Union.
The Russian proposal was in re
ply to a letter from President Tru
man of July 7 informing Moscow
that the U.S. Congress had passed i
resolution expressing friendship for
the Russian people—but not their
government. He also hoped the iron,
curtain could be lifted and closer
ties established between the twj
nations.
Significantly, the Russian mes
sage today contained no reference
to the UN.
