						Coffee Cup and You
## 
### 
There's a small but helpful act which many persons are forget
ting to perform when in the Cellar for that morning coffee or after
noon Coke.
Because of the limitation of facilities and the lack of time for
doing that job, the Cellar has always reguested that those who eat
in 'he booths clear their dishes off the table and into the trays pro
vided, except when served by the hashers at lunch or dinner.
It's a small thing, but something everyone can do to make it
more pleasant for the next cjuy to use the table. Wouldn't you
rather drink your coffee without having to stare at someone else's
empty cup?—B. B.
