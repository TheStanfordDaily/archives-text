Distribution of tickets to attend the forthcoming Standard Hour
Broadcast at the Office of Public Exercises last Friday from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. was so successful that by 10 the tickets were all gone.
Tliis, needless to say, disappointed many students whose only
hope was then to leave their names at the office in the hope that
extra tickets might be returned.
"t would seem that a more eguitable distribution of the tickets
might have been made had tickets been pro-rated throughout the
da/, since it was announced that tickets would be distributed dur
ing that period. This method has proved very satisfactory in the
past for other student body activities where it was seen that the
demand would be high.
•n this case, the tickets were free and the limit was two. Human
psychology being what it is, no doubt a few persons took the limit
though they weren't sure they would use both tickets. Reforms
aren't going to help the situation for Sunday's concert, so the plea
of those who got no tickets but had to settle for a name on a wait
ing list, is that those with tickets which won't be used return them
to the Office of Public Exercises for further distribution.—D. H.
