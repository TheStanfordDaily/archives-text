To the Editor:
When Mr. Newman wrote his article in The Daily of Aug. 3, he
did not realize that he was following the Americo-European up
side-down logic. You eat with your right hand and you greet your
friends with your right hand; it is very logical, then, that when you
pick up a book you open it from the right side.
Since the great majority write with the right hand, the Egyp
tians start writing from the right side of the page and not from the
wiong (left) side of it. This system is followed not only in Egypt,
but in many other countries.

To the Editor:
It has long been my impression that efforts of the University
to encourage universal participation in student activities have
be:>n disappointingly ineffectual. That apathy is widespread is
indicated by an item appearing in your last issue.
The well-bred, reserved, introverted student, of whom there
are many here, is likely to conclude shortly after arrival that it is
futile to seek congenial company at organized events, and his
withdrawal from them makes it egually difficult for his successor
of like mind. Thus many of those who most need increased social
confidence are least likely to acguire it.
