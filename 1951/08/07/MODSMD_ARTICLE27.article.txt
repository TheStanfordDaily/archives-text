Ah, the joy and confusion of it all.
It seems in my column lust week, I made a reference that there
would he no frosh sports ol any nature at Stanford beginning this fall.
Apparently I took the point as common knowledge and failed to make
clear just why there wouldn't he any. or what would he the fate of the
class ol '55 athletes.
No Frosh Sports—Now Come?
So on this fair Tuesday morning, allow me to elucidate. It all started
last spring when the draft threatened to remove all eligible men from
school, athletes included. The chances looked darker than a Mexican's
three-day beard, that any university would be able to field a team, and if
it did, the team would lack depth.
In the face of this, the Pacific Coast Conference fathers made a move
that appeared a wise one. They made freshmen eligible for varsity sports,
beginning with the fall of 1 !»51.
This obviously makes freshmen eligible for football at Stanford. Wish-
Jug to clarify the point just a little further for those still dubious, I
trekked over to the Board of Athletic Control and had a session with
Robert Young, not the niovie star, but the Manager of Physical Education
Operations, as the Directory lists him.
The results were enlightening. I learned exactly what Stanford
plans to do with freshmen, that no frosh teams are available, and there
isn t that man shortage that everyone was afeared was coming.
In the first place, varsity practice opens Sept. 1. It is open to all who
receive an invitation. That's right; the current pattern is for the coach
ing staff to send out engraved invites to all those that the staff wishes the
honor ol entertaining with two-a-day workouts starting the first. Among
this group will be 2U frosh. More are expected later, but not for the
coming-out party.
It is as doubtful as rain on Saturday night that any of these incoming
hosh will step into a varsity berth. Young said he i.s doubtful that there
will be six frosh playing varsity ball throughout the Conference.
What to Do with Frosh Footballers
In the face of this, the question arises what will happen to Stanford's
footballing frosh? The answer is almost simple for a change. There will
be an intensified junior varsity program to accommodate the yearlings,
as well as those who leave something to be desired as far as varsity play
goes. But it should be stressed that any player can work himself up to
varsity ball, if his ability warrants it. This system is what Chuck Taylor
i.i counting on to obtain depth and also to secure replacements for those
varsity aspirants who don't pan out.
The JV organization will consist of two squads under the coaching of
Mai Elward and Bob Ghilotti. There will be a team one and a team two,
with order of promotion going from team two to one, and then varsity.
Team one will have a full schedule, playing other conference schools and
service teams. The second JV squad will be mostly limited to banging
heads with the varsity on weekdays and running the plays of Stanford's
coming Saturday opponent.
Saturday Afternoon Varsity Prelims
Conference teams with the exception of UCLA, which seems just to
have forgotten the junior varsity, will field teams of similar caliber as that
of Stanford's Braves. Preliminaries to varsity tilts will be staged between
these scrub squads. These contests should give Monday morning quarter
backs a good chance to look ahead to next year, or to criticize the coach
for not using a JV player as a varsity combatant, or vice-versa.
So there is the picture as it stands now. The outlook is the same con
cerning all Stanford sports in the coming year: No frosh teams but a
strenuous junior varsity program, which after all has always been referred
to as building for the future. Perhaps that's still true.
Stanford at this time expects no draft casualties. Ninety percent of
the gridders, excluding incoming frosh, are safely tucked away in reserve
programs. What about the other ten per cent? •Well, they are hidden
away in the folds of the Farm's ROTC. A couple of the boys even have
vocational deferments—Bill McColl and Leon King.
With the draft scare so greatly reduced, the entire freshman goings-on
.seem already somewhat outdated. But Victor Schmidt and his Confer
ence officials certainly cannot be criticized for a good try.
Taylor Wants Toughies, No Breathers
While on the subject of football, it's quite encouraging to note, by way
of Palo Alto Times Sports Editor Walt Gamage, that Chuck Taylor i.s as
ambitious as a beaver in a woodpile. Taylor has made a request to Ath
letic Director Al Masters to do his best to line up tough intei sectional
games. Nothing easy for our hoy Chuck. He wants such as SMU, Okla
homa, Ohio State, and other big-time football schools.
The red-head isn't shaking in his bouts with the thought of losing
these big ones and the subsequent alumni action. He explained. "Sup
pose you play a couple of easy warm-ups. It's almost impossible to get
your players up for those soft games. So you end up winning the two
names by a fair margin but look only so-so doing it. What happens?
Everybody moans about how lousy you looked even if you do win."
He added, "I'd rather get beaten by a good club and make a good
showing than trim a mediocre outfit. I subscribe to the theory that you're
not going to beat the best if you don't play 'em."
More power to you. Chuck.
