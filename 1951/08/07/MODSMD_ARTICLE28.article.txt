# Blaik Defends Army Gridders
## 
### United Press 
West Point Football Coach Earl |
i Blaik jumped to the defense of his l
| football-playing cadets accused of j
I Honor Code violation when he said |
j yesterday,"I am sure that when the
| whole story is understood, no l'air
j minded man will condemn them."
Blaik. whose 1951 team is re-
I ported "wiped out," broke his
j three - day silence on the biggest
■ scandal in the 150-year history of
i the Military Academy to say that
he didn't condone the cadets' erib-
I bing on exams, but that he still con- !

sidered them "some of the finest
men we have in the Corps — the
type of men who the record shows
have made the finest leaders."
Blaik refused to say whether he
will quit his coaching job as a re
sult of the scandal, but hinted that
he would announce his decision on
Thursday.
Press Conference reporters agreed
not to ask Blaik about his son Bob,
Army's star quarterback. Bob has
not been identified as one of the ac
cused cadets, but he did attend a
meeting of them.
