# Senate to Probe Cheating Scandal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (UP)â€”A
Senate investigation into the West
Point cheating scandal was ordered
today and Sen. William M. Benton
(D., Conn.) demanded an immedi
ate halt to big-time football at both
West Point and Annapolis.
Chairman Clyde R. Hoey (D..
N.C.) said his powerful permanent
Senate Investigating Committee
will 'get the preliminary facts" on
the dismissal of 90 cadets in case a
"lull-scale" inquiry should be or
dered, possibly by the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
Hoey's announcement came as
Army Football Coach Earl Blaik
and West Point Superintendent
Maj. Gen. Frederick Irving said at
West Point that they would wel
come a Congressional investigation.
Blaik said the football players in
volved were of "excellent charac
ter" and that he wanted their "true
character" revealed to the public.
Hoey emphasized that his com
mittee's work will be "preliminary"
and aimed at establishing the
"groundwork" in the event that a
full inquiry is deemed justified. He
believed many schools "show con
sideration" to football players but
that this "does not justify violating
an honor code."
The Hoey committee, which has
conducted many of the Senate's
biggest investigations, did not say
when it would begin its inquiry. It
has one of the largest stalls of in
vestigators of any Congressional
body.
