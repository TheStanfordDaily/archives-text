# Honor Code, the Army, and Us
## 
### 
Ihe Black Knights of the Hudson are back in the news. This
tnne it concerns one of their infrequent losses, but a loss more im
portant than any football game the West Pointers have ever
played. It is the loss of honor and integrity, not only of a few foot
ball players and students, but also of the whole academy, from the
big brass down to the janitor.
The pot has obviously been stewing for a long time, as evi
denced by the many claims that cribbing has become an accus
tomed pastime at the Point. It indicates a moral lapse on the part
of students and faculty, an unbelieveably naive assumption that
dishonesty of any shape or kind can contribute to individual or
group fulfillment.
An interesting, and misleading, sidelight of the incident is the
claim at West Point that 90 students will be expelled lor violations
of the honor code. Students on the Farm, who are familiar with
the way the Honor Code works here, may well wonder how any
-0110 can classify the Aimy system as an honor code.
We at Stanford are familiar with an Honor Code that has woiked
efficiently for 30 years only with the complete co-operation of
the entire student body and faculty. Without firm belief in and
enforcement of the Honor Code by everyone, it never would have
suivived its first year.
Briefly, the Honor Code at Stanford means this. Students will
accept no unpermitted aid in class work. This applies to all work
a student does, whether it be an examination, a term paper, or
some other'form of school work.
The Honor Code was started here in 1921 because the students
believed the responsibility for honesty should rest 011 their own
shoulders. The students enforce the Honor Code and handle vio
lations. The faculty and administration give the Honor Code
wholehearted support because it has proved so successful. One
lapse, such as has occurred at West Point, would destroy the
Honor Code at Stanford, as it will destroy the so-called honor
code at the Army.
As long as schools like West Point supposedly have an honor
code Stanford need not take pride 111 the mere possession of one.
But to have one that works is living testimony that honor and in
tegrity flourish best in the individual, and that, indeed, is some
thing to shout about.

believed the responsibility for honesty should rest 011 their own
shoulders. The students enforce the Honor Code and handle vio
lations. The faculty and administration give the Honor Code
wholehearted support because it has proved so successful. One
lapse, such as has occurred at West Point, would destroy the
Honor Code at Stanford, as it will destroy the so-called honor
code at the Army.
As long as schools like West Point supposedly have an honor
code Stanford need not take pride 111 the mere possession of one.
But to have one that works is living testimony that honor and in
tegrity flourish best in the individual, and that, indeed, is some
thing to shout about.
