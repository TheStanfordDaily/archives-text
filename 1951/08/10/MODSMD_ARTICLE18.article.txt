# Farm Football, a Farce?

### 
To tin* Editor:
I would like (o point out two se
rious mistakes whieh are now pres
ent at our University. One arrived
I.tst year and one has been present
for a period ol time, die exact ex
tent of which I have no idea, hut
which runs into years.
The first one 1 mentioned arrived
with our present head football
eoach. Although 1 realise that Mr.
Chuck Taylor is a line individual
and possibly a good eoach, it seems
to me that he is trying to accom
plish too much too fast.
1 was startled and displeased to
see Chuck's recent statement on
football opponents. His idea or plan,
as you will, to play no so-called
ea- v teams (. that is, as an example,
substituting Oklahoma for San Jose
State, Michigan for Santa Clara,
etc ) seems very line on the surface,
but upon close examination one sees
the absurdity of it all.
Do we have a team whieh can
play football against such competi
tion week alter week, all season? 1
hardly think so. One has otdy to
.survey our past record. Here on
the West Coast where football has
been at a low ebb since the war,
Stanford has been sporadic in its

wins and disgusting in its losses.
Many will say, "That's all
changed now. We have a new
coach." That would be line if true;
but any coach, no matter how good,
must have material.
Now again some will say, "Stan
ford has had material." Certainly
it has; maybe as many as 15 top
flight hall players a year. Without
well-trained players two or three
teams deep, both offensive and de
fensive, a coach is in for trouble
when he starts taking on the big
ones week after week.
Consequently I suggest Chuck
wipe the stars from his eyes and
lace reality. That is, unless he
wishes to achieve Mr. Sehwart's
douhtlul distinction ol no wins, nine
losses but just one hell of a good
guy.
The last thing I have to say can
be said very briefly. It's lucky Stan
lord isn't a military academy or
Chuck Taylor and Coach Karl Rlaik
might be in an identical position.
And there are plenty ol people who
know what I mean. So before we
laugh at the Black Knights of the
Hudson, perhaps we should cheek
our own big bay windows for any
