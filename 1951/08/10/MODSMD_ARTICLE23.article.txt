## Time Out... 
### 
It's about time somebody gave some of these baseball broadcasters the
word. Because the word they're using right now doesn't mean much with- j
out a translator.
It's getting so tuning in a baseball game is like making love to a South j
African Übangi. You know what's being played, but you can't under- ;

stand a word the girl says—so you never know wheat
the score is. Not that we want all sportscasters to
sound like etymology professors.
Let's face it. You just can't go around saying, "The
third baseman doubled to right field driving in the
tying run from first base.'' It's so grammatically cor
rect it would twang the heart-strings of your old Eng
lish 2A instructor. But good grammar went out with
chaperones and button-shoes. Nobody talks English
at the ball park. They talk Baseball.
So unless you want .to be known as a guy nobody
will even bum a cigarette off of, you've got to tell it
this way: ''The guardian of the hot-corner rattled the

boards with a clothesline blast—a prodigious wallop that the outer-gar
dener played flawlessly oft' the barrier at the 320-foot mark—and chased
the fleet-footed short-patcher home from the initial hassock with the
tally that knotted the count." Now you're talking Baseball.
A SCOTCHMAN—AND FROM DALLAS, TEXAS, YET
But a guy who calls himself the Old Scotchman—he lives in Dallas,
Texas, naturally—has started building a language that isn't English OR
Baseball. He's got tired of the standard-equipment sort of cliches, and
gone out and got a few homey bromides for his very own.
If your dial happens to stumble across the Lqfie-Star Scotchman some
morning, here's what he'll come at you with: "And so—right after the
Rupert Rifles take the rag off the bush for three in the hello spasm—the
Bosockers go to work faster than an executive with a sexy secretary, and
with the bases L.B.S.—loaded by Sox —the crows are in the corn and
Raschi's about to jump in the pickle-vat."
Of course, what he means, is that the Yankees scored three runs in the
first inning and now the Red Sox are threatening. Naturally, he can't say
just that. Why, then even Canasta players would know what he was
talking about. But he can still be unintelligible to the rift-raff without
making the baseball fan hire an interpreter.
LET'S DO THIS THING ACCORDING TO ETIQUETTE
All he's got to do is put it this way: "The Bronx Bombers jumped on
the Beantown hurler's offerings for a trio of tallies in the initial frame.
But now the bags are bulging with Bostons, and there's feverish activity
in the Yankee bullpen as port-side-swinging Billy Goodman steps in to
comb the slants of the New York moundsman, quick Vic Raschi." What
could be easier to understand?
This all may seem like a minor point, but actually, the whole world
is just full of troubles caused by people not knowing what other people
mean when they say something. Take for instance the current hassle at
West Point. It all started because somebody said "Honor Code" and a
bunch of guys thought he meant "Free Ride."
I had the same sort of trouble just last week with Ava Gardner. Just
before she went to Mexico, we had a big argument at the border. Finally
she said, "Well, aren't you going to come across?"
I still don't know what she meant. Guess I'll have to ask Sinatra some
time.
