# Red Blaik Says He Will Stay On as Army Coach
## 
### 
Earl (Red) Blaik announced yes
terday that he expected to continue I
as head coach at the United States
Military Academy, where his foot- !
ball squad has been shattered by
an exam-cribbing expose.
The 54-year-old retired colonel, j
head of the Army team for the last I
10 years, made the announcement
at a two-hour press conference at- '
tended by some 40 fans and sports- j
writers.
"I feel I can best make the people
understand these boys and their j
problems and that I can do the j
proper thing for our fine institu- j
tion," the head coach said in his j
statement.
During the interview, Blaik said j
that approximately 50 per cent of
the 90 cadets involved were ath
letes and that "all but a few of his
45-man football squad "were in
cluded."
He said that athletes from the I
baseball and basketball teams also
were involved.
Blaik said, however, that "our
biggest problem is to see to it that
these men leave West Point with

the same kind of a reputation they
had when they arrived."
"The action taken was by men
who believed was the only pos
sible action," he added.
