# A 						Revolution in Medical Education?
## 
### 
A teaching doctor at Stanford University and a research engi
neer from Portland. Oregon, have just completed the first phase
of a project that may revolutionize medical education.
The project: A complete atlas of human anatomy in three-di
mensional kodachrome transparencies, each keyed to a matching
J diagram drawn to scale.

Dr. David L. Bassett, associate
I professor of anatomy in the Stan
ford Medical School, and his col
! league William B. Gruber. inventor
of a modern stereoscope known as
| the "View Master," have finished
! the painstaking task of photograph
i ing 2158 related dissections of just
! the human central nervous system
I alone.
Two Years' Work
It has taken them two years to
complete this section of the .stereo
scopic atlas and it will be published
early in 1952. It will take them six
; to eight years and some 2,000 d is -
J sections and photographs before
j their project is consummated.
Dean Loren R. Chandler, of the
i Stanford School of Medicine, de
j scribes the results ot work done
| thus far as "the finest educational
, atlas of anatomy I've seen."
Mr. Gruber was first encouraged
! to put his stereoscopic camera to
j work on a medical subject by Dr.
W. K. Livingston, head of surgery
j at the University of Oregon Medical
1 School in Portland.
Periodic experiments of anatom
! ical photography followed. Mr. Gru
ber continued to improve his tech
| niques and redesign his equipment.

\ In August 1948 he met David Bas
sett, a young aantomist wholeheart
edly interested in the work the
Gruber camera could produce for
his science. In mid-1949 work start
ed on the atlas.
Artist the Team
Now working with the doctor-en
gineer team is medical artist Ruth
Ogren. She traces the outlines and
important details uf each specimen
directly from a conventional pho
tograph, checking for shading de
tails and depth relationships with a
stereoscope. Miss Ogren's drawings
provide identification for every an
atomical feature shown in the

] three-dimensional views, which si:
; themselves left unmarked.
Dr. Bassett. Stanford trained both
as an undergraduate and an M.D.,
has taught at the University since
1939. He is the son of Dr. Lee Em
erson Bassett, Stanford professor
emeritus of speech and drama.
Mr. Gruber, an organ and piano
builder in Munich until he came to
the United States in 1923, turned a
long-time hobby of stereoscopy and
j photography into a career with hi
j invention of the "View Master."
i He is now chief research engineer
| for Sawyer's at Progress, Oregon.

Artist the Team
Now working with the doctor-en
gineer team is medical artist Ruth
Ogren. She traces the outlines and
important details uf each specimen
directly from a conventional pho
tograph, checking for shading de
tails and depth relationships with a
stereoscope. Miss Ogren's drawings
provide identification for every an
atomical feature shown in the

] three-dimensional views, which si:

Dr. Bassett. Stanford trained both
as an undergraduate and an M.D.,
has taught at the University since
1939. He is the son of Dr. Lee Em
erson Bassett, Stanford professor
emeritus of speech and drama.
Mr. Gruber, an organ and piano
builder in Munich until he came to
the United States in 1923, turned a
long-time hobby of stereoscopy and
j photography into a career with hi
j invention of the "View Master."

A teaching doctor at Stanford University and a research engi
neer from Portland. Oregon, have just completed the first phase
of a project that may revolutionize medical education.
The project: A complete atlas of human anatomy in three-di
mensional kodachrome transparencies, each keyed to a matching
J diagram drawn to scale.

Dr. David L. Bassett, associate
I professor of anatomy in the Stan
ford Medical School, and his col
! league William B. Gruber. inventor
of a modern stereoscope known as
| the "View Master," have finished
! the painstaking task of photograph
i ing 2158 related dissections of just
! the human central nervous system
I alone.
Two Years' Work
It has taken them two years to
complete this section of the .stereo
scopic atlas and it will be published
early in 1952. It will take them six
; to eight years and some 2,000 d is -
J sections and photographs before
j their project is consummated.
Dean Loren R. Chandler, of the
i Stanford School of Medicine, de
j scribes the results ot work done
| thus far as "the finest educational
, atlas of anatomy I've seen."
Mr. Gruber was first encouraged
! to put his stereoscopic camera to
j work on a medical subject by Dr.
W. K. Livingston, head of surgery
j at the University of Oregon Medical
1 School in Portland.
Periodic experiments of anatom
! ical photography followed. Mr. Gru
ber continued to improve his tech
| niques and redesign his equipment.
