# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## The 						West Point Honor Code 
### 
The present deplorable breach <>i
the Honor System at West Point,
rather than degrading the Acad
emy. has illustrated the high pur
pose and integrity of the Honor
S\ stem at West Point.
At West Point, as at Stanford,
question.-; ot honor are settled by
tin student body. Each year the
cadets select from among them
selves representatives to a Cadet
Honor Committee. This committee
is responsible for interpreting ques
tions ot honor. The honor .it West
Point means that a cadet will nei
ther lie, cheat, nor steal. Honor is
a vital influence in the day-to-day
lilt ot every cadet. A cadet who
protects an honor violator is guilty
himself.
Obviously, both the individual
cadet who first reported the recent
honor violation and the Cadet Hon
or Committee knew beforehand that
the announcement of wholesale ca
det dismissals would heap public
abuse on not only Army's football
team but also on the Academy it

self. They acted because they real
ized that the preservation of the
Honor System was more important
than adverse publicity.
II a cadet should be judged
"guilty" by the Cadet Honor Com
mittee ot any breach of honor, even
though he be acquitted by a court
martial, the following actions will
be taken by the Corps of Cadets
it he refuses to resign: until gradu
ation not a word will be spoken to
him except in line of duty; he. is
allowed no roommates; his class
ring will be taken from him; he
has a table by himself in the mess
hall; if he takes a girl friend to a
dance, everybody clears the dance
Hoot ; it he goes to the theater, the
surrounding seats are left vacant.
Such will be the fate of the present
violators if they buck the Honor
of the Corps.
The West Point Honor System is
working, and the present situation
cannot mar the integrity of the West
Point Honor System.
