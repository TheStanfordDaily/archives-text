I'm for making college football professional. Now hold on a minute.
I haven't lost all my marbles. Read on inst out of sympathy and respect.
President Truman has ordered a full investigation of the athletic
systems at both West Point and Annapolis to determine if the service
academies are "over-emphasizing" football. The results will definitely
.show that they are.
But so are all other leading universities in the nation. As commander
in-chief ot the armed forces, the jurisdiction of the military academies
does fall into the President's hands. But, who is going to investigate col
lege football? Who will clean up their policies? Will it be up to the
individual collegc heads, their respective conferences, or another Con
gressional investigation? The results of such a probe into college football
would be as illuminating as a harvest moon, because football has grown
out of all proportions. It has passed the stage of playing fo.r fun, and is
now an industry. Football today is no longer a game, but a cold-hearted,
money-conscious, competitive business.
Gout' Are the Days of Recreational Football
And the saddest part is that the day is gone when recreation and
sportsmanship were placed above the almighty dollar. Let's face it. The
nations universities would not collectively agree to tone down football
emphasis, because football is a good money-maker.
Ibis transition of football from a game to a business has likewile
switched me from a mild conservative to a radical, advocating that col
lege football should turn professional. Apparently de-emphasis is out,
so why not get oft the picket fence and go whole hog by making college
football an open play-for-pay proposition?
There's no getting away from the fact that every university of any
iootball note whatsoever aids its players in one manner or another. Here
at Stanford the Buck of the Month Club and scholarships defray the tui
tion of many a football player. At other schools similar means are used.
In some instances outright gifts are dangled in the faces of high school
athletes to induce them to attend that particular university.
Why not make the paying of athletes legal throughout the nation?
Each university would have a salary scale of its own. Perhaps footballers'
tuition charges could be waived. This would have the same result but
perhaps not the same implication as paying cold cash for the services of
a star guard for four years. Those universities with high football aspira
tions and equally fat purses would lure the better players. Others would
play football in their own class of competition.
Nevada Did It with Silver Dollars
It's been tried. Following the war, the University of Nevada, in the
days ot Stan Heath, openly paid its players. No punches pulled, they
came rit;lit out and admitted paying their boys. And you know how they
raised the money for such a venture? The little quiet community of
Keno gladly pitched in and raised sufficient funds. A sort of local pride.
That's the way the college plan could be financed.
Football financial worries would no longer be left solely to the alumni
and athletic department. Rather, it would be the pride and joy of the
alumni working together with the community to put the local entry on
top in the nation s lootball race. It worked at Nevada until no one would
come out to the middle of the desert regardless of the silver dollars and
jackpots offered by Reno's civic-minded residents.
University Purpose Overshadowed hv Hall
There's no question that this seems like a world-shaking suggestion.
But lacing the fact that college lootball is definitely out of line with the
purpose ol a true university, and won t get back in step, why not bring
college football payoffs right out into the open? Everyone realizes that
schools which have consistently better grid teams offer their players just
a little more in the way of rewards than those which are maintaining so
called standards—standards which may be the result of just not enough
loot to lure the stars.
The mushrooming growth of football has done its damage to the
game as well as to the institutions where it was born and babied. It has
now conquered its master, and a modern Frankenstein monster is
upon us.
The incessant desire to win has resulted in the use of as much man
power as possible, and it isn't just to see everyone get into the game.
Its more scientific than that. Since Army's founding platoon football, the
switching of offensive and defensive units has been used by others seeking
grid glory, provided they have the material. Most schools don't have the
material, and the result has been the dropping of football by small schools
.such as St. Mary's and Nevada. That's a pity and a shame, but the situ
ation won't get better because the schools making the money just don't
want to stop making it or in any way de-emphasize football.
So let's forget the investigations—iiist pay the hoys' a salary. The
schools with the most in the old treasury and the right kind of follow
ing would get the players. It sounds hard and cold, but football is a
business and a competitive one. Remember football gate receipts, at
this institution and others, support all other athletics, (lood football at
large universities is necessary as a form of revenue, and good football,
which attracts crowds, is played only with good players. In turn, the
price of good players is high. These prices are being paid by universi
ties, but in an under-the-table way. As long as football can never be
taken back to just a Saturday afternoon game, let's go to the other ex
treme and make college football professional.

sportsmanship were placed above the almighty dollar. Let's face it. The
nations universities would not collectively agree to tone down football
emphasis, because football is a good money-maker.
Ibis transition of football from a game to a business has likewile
switched me from a mild conservative to a radical, advocating that col
lege football should turn professional. Apparently de-emphasis is out,
so why not get oft the picket fence and go whole hog by making college
football an open play-for-pay proposition?
There's no getting away from the fact that every university of any
iootball note whatsoever aids its players in one manner or another. Here
at Stanford the Buck of the Month Club and scholarships defray the tui
tion of many a football player. At other schools similar means are used.
In some instances outright gifts are dangled in the faces of high school
athletes to induce them to attend that particular university.
Why not make the paying of athletes legal throughout the nation?
Each university would have a salary scale of its own. Perhaps footballers'
tuition charges could be waived. This would have the same result but
perhaps not the same implication as paying cold cash for the services of
a star guard for four years. Those universities with high football aspira
tions and equally fat purses would lure the better players. Others would
play football in their own class of competition.
Nevada Did It with Silver Dollars
It's been tried. Following the war, the University of Nevada, in the
days ot Stan Heath, openly paid its players. No punches pulled, they
came rit;lit out and admitted paying their boys. And you know how they
raised the money for such a venture? The little quiet community of
Keno gladly pitched in and raised sufficient funds. A sort of local pride.
That's the way the college plan could be financed.
Football financial worries would no longer be left solely to the alumni
and athletic department. Rather, it would be the pride and joy of the
alumni working together with the community to put the local entry on
top in the nation s lootball race. It worked at Nevada until no one would
come out to the middle of the desert regardless of the silver dollars and
jackpots offered by Reno's civic-minded residents.
University Purpose Overshadowed hv Hall
There's no question that this seems like a world-shaking suggestion.
But lacing the fact that college lootball is definitely out of line with the
purpose ol a true university, and won t get back in step, why not bring
college football payoffs right out into the open? Everyone realizes that
schools which have consistently better grid teams offer their players just
a little more in the way of rewards than those which are maintaining so
called standards—standards which may be the result of just not enough
loot to lure the stars.
The mushrooming growth of football has done its damage to the
game as well as to the institutions where it was born and babied. It has
now conquered its master, and a modern Frankenstein monster is
upon us.
The incessant desire to win has resulted in the use of as much man
power as possible, and it isn't just to see everyone get into the game.
Its more scientific than that. Since Army's founding platoon football, the
switching of offensive and defensive units has been used by others seeking
grid glory, provided they have the material. Most schools don't have the
material, and the result has been the dropping of football by small schools
.such as St. Mary's and Nevada. That's a pity and a shame, but the situ
ation won't get better because the schools making the money just don't
want to stop making it or in any way de-emphasize football.
So let's forget the investigations—iiist pay the hoys' a salary. The
schools with the most in the old treasury and the right kind of follow
ing would get the players. It sounds hard and cold, but football is a
business and a competitive one. Remember football gate receipts, at
this institution and others, support all other athletics, (lood football at
large universities is necessary as a form of revenue, and good football,
which attracts crowds, is played only with good players. In turn, the
price of good players is high. These prices are being paid by universi
ties, but in an under-the-table way. As long as football can never be
taken back to just a Saturday afternoon game, let's go to the other ex
treme and make college football professional.
I'm for making college football professional. Now hold on a minute.
I haven't lost all my marbles. Read on inst out of sympathy and respect.
President Truman has ordered a full investigation of the athletic
systems at both West Point and Annapolis to determine if the service
academies are "over-emphasizing" football. The results will definitely
.show that they are.
But so are all other leading universities in the nation. As commander
in-chief ot the armed forces, the jurisdiction of the military academies
does fall into the President's hands. But, who is going to investigate col
lege football? Who will clean up their policies? Will it be up to the
individual collegc heads, their respective conferences, or another Con
gressional investigation? The results of such a probe into college football
would be as illuminating as a harvest moon, because football has grown
out of all proportions. It has passed the stage of playing fo.r fun, and is
now an industry. Football today is no longer a game, but a cold-hearted,
money-conscious, competitive business.

a star guard for four years. Those universities with high football aspira
tions and equally fat purses would lure the better players. Others would
play football in their own class of competition.
Nevada Did It with Silver Dollars
It's been tried. Following the war, the University of Nevada, in the
days ot Stan Heath, openly paid its players. No punches pulled, they
came rit;lit out and admitted paying their boys. And you know how they
raised the money for such a venture? The little quiet community of
Keno gladly pitched in and raised sufficient funds. A sort of local pride.
That's the way the college plan could be financed.
Football financial worries would no longer be left solely to the alumni
and athletic department. Rather, it would be the pride and joy of the
alumni working together with the community to put the local entry on
top in the nation s lootball race. It worked at Nevada until no one would
come out to the middle of the desert regardless of the silver dollars and
jackpots offered by Reno's civic-minded residents.
University Purpose Overshadowed hv Hall
There's no question that this seems like a world-shaking suggestion.
But lacing the fact that college lootball is definitely out of line with the
purpose ol a true university, and won t get back in step, why not bring
college football payoffs right out into the open? Everyone realizes that
schools which have consistently better grid teams offer their players just
a little more in the way of rewards than those which are maintaining so
called standards—standards which may be the result of just not enough
loot to lure the stars.
The mushrooming growth of football has done its damage to the
game as well as to the institutions where it was born and babied. It has
now conquered its master, and a modern Frankenstein monster is
upon us.
The incessant desire to win has resulted in the use of as much man
power as possible, and it isn't just to see everyone get into the game.
Its more scientific than that. Since Army's founding platoon football, the
switching of offensive and defensive units has been used by others seeking
grid glory, provided they have the material. Most schools don't have the
material, and the result has been the dropping of football by small schools
.such as St. Mary's and Nevada. That's a pity and a shame, but the situ
ation won't get better because the schools making the money just don't
want to stop making it or in any way de-emphasize football.
So let's forget the investigations—iiist pay the hoys' a salary. The
schools with the most in the old treasury and the right kind of follow
ing would get the players. It sounds hard and cold, but football is a
business and a competitive one. Remember football gate receipts, at
this institution and others, support all other athletics, (lood football at
large universities is necessary as a form of revenue, and good football,
which attracts crowds, is played only with good players. In turn, the
price of good players is high. These prices are being paid by universi
ties, but in an under-the-table way. As long as football can never be
taken back to just a Saturday afternoon game, let's go to the other ex
treme and make college football professional.
I'm for making college football professional. Now hold on a minute.
I haven't lost all my marbles. Read on inst out of sympathy and respect.
President Truman has ordered a full investigation of the athletic
systems at both West Point and Annapolis to determine if the service
academies are "over-emphasizing" football. The results will definitely
.show that they are.
But so are all other leading universities in the nation. As commander
in-chief ot the armed forces, the jurisdiction of the military academies
does fall into the President's hands. But, who is going to investigate col
lege football? Who will clean up their policies? Will it be up to the
individual collegc heads, their respective conferences, or another Con
gressional investigation? The results of such a probe into college football
would be as illuminating as a harvest moon, because football has grown
out of all proportions. It has passed the stage of playing fo.r fun, and is
now an industry. Football today is no longer a game, but a cold-hearted,
money-conscious, competitive business.
Gout' Are the Days of Recreational Football
And the saddest part is that the day is gone when recreation and
sportsmanship were placed above the almighty dollar. Let's face it. The
nations universities would not collectively agree to tone down football
emphasis, because football is a good money-maker.
Ibis transition of football from a game to a business has likewile
switched me from a mild conservative to a radical, advocating that col
lege football should turn professional. Apparently de-emphasis is out,
so why not get oft the picket fence and go whole hog by making college
football an open play-for-pay proposition?
There's no getting away from the fact that every university of any
iootball note whatsoever aids its players in one manner or another. Here
at Stanford the Buck of the Month Club and scholarships defray the tui
tion of many a football player. At other schools similar means are used.
In some instances outright gifts are dangled in the faces of high school
athletes to induce them to attend that particular university.
Why not make the paying of athletes legal throughout the nation?
Each university would have a salary scale of its own. Perhaps footballers'
tuition charges could be waived. This would have the same result but
perhaps not the same implication as paying cold cash for the services of
a star guard for four years. Those universities with high football aspira
tions and equally fat purses would lure the better players. Others would
