# Bud and Gay Do It Again
## 
### 
Bud Hold set a new British jave
j lin record Sunday and Gay Bryan
| took his usual first in the broad
j jump, as a touring American track
j and-field team continued to make
; beating a team of British all-stars
| look like filching H°°dies from an
J infant. The two teams have met
several times in the past few weeks,
and always With the same results.
The British grab the sprints and
distance runs, while the Americans
! take the hurdles, the field events,
I and the meet.
Former Stanford track man Held
j set a new Enylish national record
J with a javelin toss that would have
! won him second place against most
j strong American competition. Held
threw his spear a very respectable

225 ft. 7 1 1» in., but that is almost 15
feet short of Bud's best effort this 1
year.
In winning the broad jump, j
Bryan wasn't forced to approach his
best performances, either. He won j
with a leap ol' 23 ft. 2 1 i ih. In most'
American meets, a jump of less than
24 feet will very seldom take first
place. Gay has approached 25 feet
in some of his better efforts.
The English team depended, as I
usual, on sprinter Macdonald Bai- j
ley and distance-runner Roger Ban- i
nister to bring home the British
bacon. The limeys, it appears, can j
run last and they can run far. But
with something to jump over, or
something to throw, it's strictly no
contest.
