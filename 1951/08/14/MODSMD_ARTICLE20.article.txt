# Riddled '49ers Play Redskins
## 
### 
Wondering how their luck
can run bad, the San Franicsco
' Forty-Niners yot back to work at
Menlo for their Sunday game with
the Washington Redskins.
In San Francisco Sunday, the
I Forty-Niners went through an in
! tra - squad game which saw six
; more casualties added to the al
ready longer - than - ever sick bay
roster . Never before has the local
i professional squad been so injury
! riddled.
In Sunday's contest the Frank Al
bert-led squad defeated the Y. A.
: Tittle forces 37 to 7 in a game
| which was disappointing because
the rookies didn't show to much.
And after all, last year's veterans
; were no world-beaters.
Injured were Hal Shoener, Joe
Perry, Bob Hileman, Pete Wismann,
i Bishop Strickland, and Y. A. Tittle.
