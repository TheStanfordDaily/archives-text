# Aline M'Mahon Opens Thurs. In 'Madwoman'
## 
### 
"The Madwoman of Chaillot,"
with Aline MacMahon in the title
role, opens Thursday night in Me
morial Auditorium. Repeat presen
tations of Jean Giraudoux's fantas
tic comedy by the Stanford Players
will be given Friday and Saturday
evenings. Curtain time is 8:15 for
all performances.
Miss MacMahon is no newcomer
to Stanford. In addition to her
many Broadway and Hollywood
performances, she has made three
previous appearances with the Stan
ford Players.
The play itself concerns a rather
unbalanced old lady who goes on
a personal campaign to rid the
world of some unscrupulous busi
nessmen and politicians. She dis
covers from the King of the Sewer
Men that in the cellar where she
lives there is a door which opens
into the center of the earth. The
old dear then maneuvers the shady
profiteers, along with their press
agents and girl friends, into her cel
lar - home. The results are both
meaningful and amusing.
F. Cowles Strickland is directing
the cast of 40. This is the final pro
duction of the Stanford Players'
summer season. Tickets are avail
able at the Memorial Auditorium
box office from 9 to 5 darly. and at
the Peninsula Box Office in Palo
Alto. All seats are $1.20.
