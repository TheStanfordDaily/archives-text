# Stanford Press: Amoebas to Reg Books
## 
### CHUCK THOMAS 
On the corner of Lomita and
Panama, right next to the Daily
Shack, is the Stanford University
Press. And contrary to popular
opinion, it isn't just a factory for
grinding out Ph.D. dissertations and
statistics on the sex habits of the
amoeba. Almost every day.the
Press in some way has an effect on
each Stanford student.
Every time you $it»n out a late
leave slip, or get writer's cramp
tilling out a reg book, or look up
your latest romance in the bawl
out, you are indirectly doing busi
ness with the Press. Everything
from English A examinations to
Friday morning editions., of The
Daily comes off the big presses in
the Press printshop.
The History of the Press is al
most the history «»f the Univer
sity. Bark hi IX92—when Stan
ford was just one year old—a
student named Julius Quelle got
tired of his part-time job as a
janitor at Knrina. So he bought
himself a press that had one foot
in the junk-yard, and started do
ing small printing jobs in his
■.pare time. By IiWS be hud print
ed his first book.

Then—many books and 22 years
later — the University decided it
needed a press all its own. So Stan
ford bought Quelle out, and the
; University Prss put on its first pair
of long pants.
Today the Press has a staff of 100,
and publishes about 35 books each
j year, besides doing all the Univer
sity printing. The Press first en
tered the publishing field in 1925.
I Now almost half its energies are de
voted to selecting manuscripts,
choosing the proper size and design
for each book, and then hustling the
printed copies to book stores and
! other universities. The other half
of the Press's efforts are spent in
the actual mechanics .of printing.
The Press is a rare example of
that practically extinct phenome
non—a business that doesn't make
money because it doesn't want to.
Not 4hat any of your $220 a
quarter ff»es over to the priut
shop to keep tlie presses running.
The Press has always paid its own
way. but the accounting depart
ment still keeps some red ink
handy just in case.
There are a couple of reasons
i why printing V>oki isn't us profit-

I able to Stanford as, say, playing
I football games. For one thing, the j
i books published by the Press have j
i a very limited market.
Some of the titles—like "Inheri- |
hi nee in Silkworms" or "Music in ;
Ancient Arabia and Spain" — will
show you why. The Press rarely
sells over 5,000 copies of any one
book, and the average is much low- j
er than that.
i
But because the books are often !
quite technical, the cost of publica
tion is frequently even higher than I
I the cost of printing books with more
appealing titles and sexier covers.
But publishing learned works — [
j not making money—is the purpose I
10l the Press. As Donald P. Bean, !
j director of the Press, puts it,"The
, subordination of all activities to the '
major role of issuing scholarly ma- i
! terial is the distinguishing charac
teristic of a university press."
All is not logarithms and verte- i
| brae at the Press, though. Just for j
a change of pace, it also prints that
i milestone in American jwrnogra-
I phy, the Stanford Chaparral. Of I
, course, when handling Chappie, the ;
! printers all wear gloves — just to '
keep their hands clean.
