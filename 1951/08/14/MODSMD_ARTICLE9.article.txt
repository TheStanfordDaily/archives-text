## A 						Chance to Question 
### 
When Dr. Hammanohar Lohia comes to the Farm Friday night,
St inford students and (acuity will have a rare opportunity to get
some first-hand information about India and India's place in rela
tion to Asia and the rest of the world.
Dr. Lohia's talk and the panel question peiiod should both be
very interesting, but beyond these, here is a chance to ask those
perplexing questions about Asia that have been plaguing you
ior many moons.
Dr. Lohia, head of the India Socialist party, has a program for
increasing the standard of living for the people of his country.
This program calls for decentralized industry and more farming.
What we would like to ask is what good more food and more
job opportunities will do in a country that has maintained a sub
sistence standard of living for centuries.
Perhaps Dr. Lohia has an answer for that, and if so, we'd like to
hear it.
In the general question period that follows the panel, the insa
tiable curiosity of an intellectual community should keep Dr.
Lohia busy, and the audience highly interested.
