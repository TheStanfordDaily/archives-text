# A 						Summer Flop
## 
### 
Today is the last day of the summer charity drive and it looks
like the Farm will hit a new low for stinginess. Up to last night a
bevy of solicitors and the two student-manned booths had man
aged to collect about $50. No matter how you slice it, it still comes
out about three cents per person for every man, woman, and
hasher on the Farm.
Why the contributions are so low is a good guestion, and no
doubt there are several answers. Mainly, we think, students are
reluctant to part with money for a charity drive unless they are
contacted personally and know just what their money is going
lor. Stanford shouldn't need dramatic posters showing starving
children or blind persons groping their way along, but it appears
that something like that is necessary to pull the drive out of the
doldrums.
In the past charity drives were conducted by individual or
ganizations, but the practice was stopped because every time a
student turned around someone was asking for a donation. Even
though the causes were worthy, one drive after another was mo
notonous. So the new system was inaugurated whereby only
one drive was held each guarter and the money was held in a fund
to be apportioned to various organizations when annual reguests
lot money came in.
The new system makes the one charity drive more important
than ever, for if it fails to go over, all the organizations we custom
arily contribute to will bo short-changed.
The goal in the current drive is $1,000, or about 40 cents for each
student. This doesnt' mean you have to contribute 40 cents. If
you can afford less, contribute less, but if you can afford more,
give it.
If you wonder where the money goes or whether or not it will
do any good, ask a blind man where he got his Seeing Eye dog,
or when you see a picture of a child with infantile paralysis, think,
lor a moment, what makes his cure possible. It's contributions.
Stop in at one of the booths, in front of the Cellar and between
the main library and the Education Building, between 8 a.m. and
1:30 p.m. today and drop off a nickel, a dime, or a dollar. It takes
so little effort, yet yields such woi>derful fruit.


Your hair smells so lovely tonight, Flossie. I'll bet you just
washed it, huh?"
