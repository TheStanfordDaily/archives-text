All summer long you have been
reading the peerless prose of Mr.
Cahn and the peerless puns of Mr.
Thomas. Now my cohorts have
trotted off to the showers, leaving
you to face the bottom third of the
batting order, so to speak.
The Lo.-> Angeles Rams gored
(clever?) the Washington Redskins
Wednesday and the '4S)ers meet the
Skins on Sunday. All of which goes
to prove that football has sneaked
up on us again. Just to get in the
right frame ol mind for it all, we'll
take a quick jaunt around the
country to see how the collegiate
situation looks this year.
VYYst Taking Over
The picture is a pleasant one, for
the Eastern and Midwestern power
houses appear to be at their lowest
ebb in 12 years, while the South
west and Pacific Coast are at their
strongest., Thus when USC mur
ders Army in the Yankee Stadium
come November 3 and Cal tromps
Penn and Minnesota and Washing
ton beat Minnesota and Illinois, the
West may regain a little of the
prestige that our Berkeley cousins
have lost by choking in three
straight Rose Eowls.
The national powers are not hard
to spot for almost every star of last
year's powerhouses has returned.
Therefore Princeton, Texas, Okla
homa, Tennessee, and Cal appear to
have the best chance to go unde
feated. Ohio State should drop a
or two. but still win enough
to show up in Pasadena next year.
Rounding out the top ten might
be Kentucky, Texas A&M, Michi
gan, and the winner of the Stan
ford-Washington game.
Stanford Strong
Stanford's team should be like
iast year's only better. The defense
will lie impregnable. Everybody is
back except Russ Pomeroy. The
running attack looks like the weak
point and the offensive burden will
probably again fall upon the mus
cular right arm of Gary Kerkorian.
Last year on the occasions when
Kerkorian was hot, they won five
and tied Cal. When he was off, the
whole offense folded.
Stanford's main worry should be
a suicide schedule which includes
five rough "breathers" plus games
against Cal, USC, Michigan, UCLA,
and Washington. Nobody could get
through all that undefeated and
Stanford could play their best ball
in 11 years and still drop four
games. Win or lose, Bill McColl
should be a cinch All-America.
For our dark horse of the year
we give you the Fort Dix Maulers,
who we understand are angling to
a backfield of four fellows
named Blaik. Pollard, Filipski, and
Pollock. I hear they're pretty good.
