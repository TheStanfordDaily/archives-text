## 
### 
The Yankees closed the gap on
the Indians to one and a half games
by defeating the hapless Washing
ton Senators 5 to 3, while the
Browns were upsetting Cleveland 4
to 0. The Red Sox muffed a chance
to gain on ihe leaders by dropping
a 10 to 2 decision to the A's.

Little Artie Shallock, ex-Holly
i wood twirler, showed his best form
j to date in pitching the Yanks to vic-
I tory.
Erratic Tommy Byrne stopped the
Indians with a three-hitter. Mike
Garcia pitched his usual good bull
for the Tribe, but no one could
J touch Byrne, who is always at his
best against Cleveland.
In the National loop, New York
downed Brooklyn 2 to 1. Two of
the National League and baseball's
best, Sal 'Maglie and Don New
combe, hitched up in a torrid pitch
ing duel. Maglie now has won 17
and lost only 5.
In other games, Detroit beat the
1 tattered White Sox, 2 to 1. and St.
! Louis downed Pittsburgh, 9 to t>.
