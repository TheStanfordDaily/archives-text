"REINCARNATION"—Sequoia Hall, unoccupied except for storage since 1945, is again to be
put to use. Preliminary work has begun to lighten the load on the walls and reduce the building
to one story. It will then be used to house the new Applied Mathematics and Statistics Labo
ratory. Built in 1894, it was the original Roble Hall. Alter the present Roble was built, Sequoia
housed male students and was used by the War Department during the war. It was con
demned as unfit for use six years ago. The hall has figured in much of Stanford's tradition.
