# U.S. Gives Russia Warning Against Blocking Treaty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 (UP)—The United States bluntly put
Russia on notice today that it will not tolerate Soviet attempts to
obstruct the Japanese peace treaty conference next month by pre
senting new Communist-style proposals for changes.
Simultaneously, President Truman told his news conference he

does not think Russia or anyone
else can block the treaty, which
provides unprecedented "soft" terms
for the former enemy nation.
A brief, formal U.S. note deliv
ered in Moscow said in effect that
the pact now is in its final form for
signature in San Francisco after
nearly a year of continuous inter
national negotiations—and the So
viets missed the boat if they want
any major alterations.
Mr. Truman was confident the
treaty would be approved without
major change. He added that he
would be most happy to see Andrei
A. Gromyko if the Russian chief
delegate so desires. The State De
partment said Gromyko so far has
not requested such a meeting.
Meanwhile, the State Department
announced that chief American
treaty negotiator John Foster Dul
les has discussed with Gen. Douglas
Mac-Arthur the possibilities of Mac-
Arthur taking part in the meeting
"in a suitable way."
No definite arrangements have
been made, although Mr. Truman
said he is perfectly willing to have
the ousted Far Eastern commander
speak at the conference. Dulles ap
proached Mac Arthur with the full
approval of the President and Sec
retary of State Dean Acheson.
Foreign diplomatic sources said
Mac Arthur had been asked to at
tend, but refused. They reported
the State Department has asked the
general to reconsider in view of his
wide knowledge of Japanese prob
lems.
Delivery of the latest American
note coincided with the announce
ment by the United States and the
Philippine Republic that they will
conclude a defense treaty pledging
mutual military support in the Pa
cific. Signing is expected at the San
Francisco meeting.
A joint statement bv the Ameri

can embassy in Manila and the
Philippines Department of Foreign
Affairs said the pact would be con
cluded "as part of a growing treaty
fabric of peace in the Pacific."
''The two nations," the statement
said, "have formally expressed com
mon determination to defend them
selves against armed attack and
joint recognition that an armed at
tack in the Pacific area on either
would be dangerous to the other's
peace and safety."
The statement pointed out that
the two countries' mutual interest
in defense already has been under
scored in the 1947 agreement under
which the United States maintains
military bases in the Philippine Is
lands.
Under the U.S.-Philippines mili
tary assistance agreement of the
same year, the government has been
receiving aid from the United
States.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 (UP)—The United States bluntly put
Russia on notice today that it will not tolerate Soviet attempts to
obstruct the Japanese peace treaty conference next month by pre
senting new Communist-style proposals for changes.
Simultaneously, President Truman told his news conference he

does not think Russia or anyone
else can block the treaty, which
provides unprecedented "soft" terms
for the former enemy nation.
A brief, formal U.S. note deliv
ered in Moscow said in effect that
the pact now is in its final form for
signature in San Francisco after
nearly a year of continuous inter
national negotiations—and the So
viets missed the boat if they want
any major alterations.
Mr. Truman was confident the
treaty would be approved without
major change. He added that he
would be most happy to see Andrei
A. Gromyko if the Russian chief
delegate so desires. The State De
partment said Gromyko so far has
not requested such a meeting.
Meanwhile, the State Department
announced that chief American
treaty negotiator John Foster Dul
les has discussed with Gen. Douglas
Mac-Arthur the possibilities of Mac-
Arthur taking part in the meeting
"in a suitable way."
No definite arrangements have
been made, although Mr. Truman
said he is perfectly willing to have
the ousted Far Eastern commander
speak at the conference. Dulles ap
proached Mac Arthur with the full
approval of the President and Sec
retary of State Dean Acheson.
Foreign diplomatic sources said
Mac Arthur had been asked to at
tend, but refused. They reported
the State Department has asked the
general to reconsider in view of his
wide knowledge of Japanese prob
lems.
Delivery of the latest American
note coincided with the announce
ment by the United States and the
Philippine Republic that they will
conclude a defense treaty pledging
mutual military support in the Pa
cific. Signing is expected at the San
Francisco meeting.
A joint statement bv the Ameri

can embassy in Manila and the
Philippines Department of Foreign
Affairs said the pact would be con
cluded "as part of a growing treaty
fabric of peace in the Pacific."
''The two nations," the statement
said, "have formally expressed com
mon determination to defend them
selves against armed attack and
joint recognition that an armed at
tack in the Pacific area on either
would be dangerous to the other's
peace and safety."
