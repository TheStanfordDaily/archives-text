# Excom Sponsors Dances, Swims, Melons

### HERB SETTER 
Have you had a smoke in the
lobby of the main libe lately? Did
you go to the watermelon feed last
Saturday? Have you been enjoy
ing co - recreational swimming at
the women's pool? If you have
done any of these things, you have
been realizing part of the benefits
of summer student government.
Many students wonder if summer
Excom, which stands for Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford, does anything but
hold meetings. Actually the small
governing body, is just as busy now
as during any other quarter.
Besides handling the hundred and
one details that come up every
quarter in governing a student
lx>dy, Excom has $700 in funds to
budget, and a social and recreation
al program to carry out.
During other quarters of the year
Excom appoints a number of sub
committees to carry out much of its
work. In the summer they do with
out most of these committees and
handle the work directly.
Social Events
Probably the greatest effort and
money from summer Excom goes
into social events. A different atti
tude, however, exists toward social
events in the summer than during
other times of the year.
It is felt that students in college
during the summer are more in
terested in relaxation in off hours
between their studies than anything
else. For that reason, Excom has
attempted to schedule social events
in which the participants are not
pushed into activities, but jre wel

come to come, relax, and do as they
please.
As a result of this philosophy, a
sport day, a watermelon feed, and a
Fourth of July picnic were ar
ranged. At ail of these events a
studnt could simply relax and do as
he pleased.
Co-Rec Swimming
Another product of the relaxed
summer social schedule was co-rec
reational swimming in the women's
pool. On Sunday afternoons, which
were almost always hot, the pool
was thrown open for swimming to
all the women students and their
male guests.
Of course, every quarter should
have an outstanding social event.
For such an event Excom planned
the semi - formal Stern-Lag-Toyon
Dance. One hundred dollars was
spent by Excom for this aafTir. This
amount was added to $350 given by
the dormitories, and the free dance
was made as elaborate as any dur
ing the regular school year when
admission was charged.
Charity Drive
A more serious aspect of summer
time administration is the charity
drive now being held. During the
three other quarters of the year
special drives are held for major
charities. Every year, however, cer
tain minor charities ask Stanford
for donations.
It was felt that a drive for money
in the summer might be used to
raise a floating fund for donations
to charities during the coming year.
Consequently, a summer charity
drive is being held this summer to
seo whether enough money can be
raised to till this floating fund, and

to see whether similar drives in
coming summers will be worth
while.
Another function of summer stu
dent government is to keep a sharp
eye out for possible campus im
provements and recommendations
to regular Excom.
Libe Smoking
One such development is the new
rule on smoking in the library.
Members of Excom decided that
this summer would be an oppor
tune time to see if smoking in the
libe could be permitted without
abuse of the privilege. If they feel
that the experiment is successful, it
will be recommended to fall Excom
that the new rule be permanent,
and that they also look into permit
ting smoking on the Inner Quad.
Another problem discussed this
summer was lack of interest in
campus social events. Summer Ex
com decided to investigate a way
to poll the campus to see how the
social program could be improved.
If they feel that the Psychology or
Education Sociology Department
could make such a poll that would
be of value in planning future so
cial programs, they will recommend
such an action to next year's Ex
ecutive Committee.
According to Vice-President Car
ol Penney, this summer's Excom
has been very active. They have
successfully carried out a well
rounded social program, planned a
charity drive, taken care of numer
ous business matters, and have
made several recommendations to
next year's student government for
campus improvement.-!.

Another product of the relaxed
summer social schedule was co-rec
reational swimming in the women's
pool. On Sunday afternoons, which
were almost always hot, the pool
was thrown open for swimming to
all the women students and their
male guests.
Of course, every quarter should
have an outstanding social event.
For such an event Excom planned
the semi - formal Stern-Lag-Toyon
Dance. One hundred dollars was
spent by Excom for this aafTir. This
amount was added to $350 given by
the dormitories, and the free dance
was made as elaborate as any dur
ing the regular school year when
admission was charged.
Charity Drive
A more serious aspect of summer
time administration is the charity
drive now being held. During the
three other quarters of the year
special drives are held for major
charities. Every year, however, cer
tain minor charities ask Stanford
for donations.
It was felt that a drive for money
in the summer might be used to
raise a floating fund for donations
to charities during the coming year.
Consequently, a summer charity
drive is being held this summer to
seo whether enough money can be
raised to till this floating fund, and

to see whether similar drives in
coming summers will be worth
while.
Another function of summer stu
dent government is to keep a sharp
eye out for possible campus im
provements and recommendations
to regular Excom.
Libe Smoking
One such development is the new
rule on smoking in the library.
Members of Excom decided that
this summer would be an oppor
tune time to see if smoking in the
libe could be permitted without
abuse of the privilege. If they feel
that the experiment is successful, it
will be recommended to fall Excom
that the new rule be permanent,
and that they also look into permit
ting smoking on the Inner Quad.
Another problem discussed this
summer was lack of interest in
campus social events. Summer Ex
com decided to investigate a way
to poll the campus to see how the
social program could be improved.
If they feel that the Psychology or
Education Sociology Department
could make such a poll that would
be of value in planning future so
cial programs, they will recommend
such an action to next year's Ex
ecutive Committee.
According to Vice-President Car
ol Penney, this summer's Excom
has been very active. They have
successfully carried out a well
rounded social program, planned a
charity drive, taken care of numer
ous business matters, and have
made several recommendations to
next year's student government for
campus improvement.-!.
Have you had a smoke in the
lobby of the main libe lately? Did
you go to the watermelon feed last
Saturday? Have you been enjoy
ing co - recreational swimming at
the women's pool? If you have
done any of these things, you have
been realizing part of the benefits
of summer student government.
Many students wonder if summer
Excom, which stands for Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford, does anything but
hold meetings. Actually the small
governing body, is just as busy now
as during any other quarter.
Besides handling the hundred and
one details that come up every
quarter in governing a student
lx>dy, Excom has $700 in funds to
budget, and a social and recreation
al program to carry out.
During other quarters of the year
Excom appoints a number of sub
committees to carry out much of its
work. In the summer they do with
out most of these committees and
handle the work directly.
Social Events
Probably the greatest effort and
money from summer Excom goes
into social events. A different atti
tude, however, exists toward social
events in the summer than during
other times of the year.
It is felt that students in college
during the summer are more in
terested in relaxation in off hours
between their studies than anything
else. For that reason, Excom has
attempted to schedule social events
in which the participants are not
pushed into activities, but jre wel

come to come, relax, and do as they
please.
As a result of this philosophy, a
sport day, a watermelon feed, and a
Fourth of July picnic were ar
ranged. At ail of these events a
studnt could simply relax and do as
he pleased.

and that they also look into permit
ting smoking on the Inner Quad.
Another problem discussed this
summer was lack of interest in
campus social events. Summer Ex
com decided to investigate a way
to poll the campus to see how the
social program could be improved.
If they feel that the Psychology or
Education Sociology Department
could make such a poll that would
be of value in planning future so
cial programs, they will recommend
such an action to next year's Ex
ecutive Committee.
According to Vice-President Car
ol Penney, this summer's Excom
has been very active. They have
successfully carried out a well
rounded social program, planned a
charity drive, taken care of numer
ous business matters, and have
made several recommendations to
next year's student government for
campus improvement.-!.
