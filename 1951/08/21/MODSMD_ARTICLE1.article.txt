## Korean Talks Deadlock 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Aug. 21 (UP) â€”Red China dealt a staggering
blow at fading hope for a compromise in the Korean truce talks
by saying bluntly that an agreement was "impossible" unless the
Allies accept the 38th parallel as the armistice line.
The four sub committee meetings at Kaesong have "failed to

make any progress" toward break- i
ing the deadlock, the Peiping radio
said in the first report from either j
side on them.
"It the American side stubbornly j
adheres to its unreasonable demand
for plunder and rejects the just and j
reasonable proposal of our side, an ,
agreement will be impossible." he j
Voice of Red China said.
Even before the new propaganda
blast from Peiping, the Kaesong
talks were near collapse from the
impact of Communist demands for j
the 3Hth parallel and a harsh pro
test against alleged neutrality vio- I
lations.
'"Because the American negotia- J
tors obstinately persist in their un- |
reasonable demand for a military j
demarcation line and demilitarized
zone north of the 38th parallel deep
into our positions, the negotiations j
for the past several days have failed
to make any progress," a Peiping
broadcast said.
