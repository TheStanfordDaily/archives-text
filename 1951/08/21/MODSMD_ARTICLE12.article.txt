# Open Letter to Student Body From Past President Hoover
## 
### 
(The following letter was written to the student body by ex-
President Herbert Hoover in answer to birthday well-wishes sent:
by Excom in behalf of the ASSU.— Ed.)
Dear Friends:
You were most thoughtful in sending me birthday greetings and
in your discussion of the purposes of our University.
Sometimes I think of the human objective of Stanford life this
wise.
Some day all the men and women who today direct this vast
American complex of governments, educational and benevolent
institutions, all those who direct the factories, the farms and th*
distribution of their products, all those who conduct the research
and professional services and the intellectual life of the nation —
they are going to die.
Your generation will need to take over the jobs in directing
these vast mechanisms, and leadership in these services.
Those who will get those jobs are those who are prepared in our
Universities and who have gained seasoning by venture into the
competitive life of the nation. It will be the enterprising and selt
reliant who will be chosen not those who are leaners in "se
curity."
To create these qualities is the object of Stanford.
And I know you are the right sort.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
