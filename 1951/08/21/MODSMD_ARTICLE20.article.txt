### JEAN MALTSEFF 
Life outside Stanford is mere existence. No Quad. No Libe. No
tuition. Instead, you try to make money. Every week there's an
other paycheck to spend. Day after day, and more money in the
coffers.
Instead of the usual office job, this year we ventured into the
restaurant business. But a cashier's job is hectic. We used to think
hashers were difficult. Professional waiters outshine them. Just
trving to make change at high speed, confining mistakes to bene
fit the house rather than cutting down your week's salary is bad
enough. But when a line of v/aiters, crowds the cash register and
ea h counts out his money in a different language, you have a real
pioblem. As 1 was telling Ava the other day (with apologies to
Cl.uck Thomas), you don't have to know the language, but it helps.
San Francisco waiters, it seems, all come eguipped with foreign
arcent. Take your pick: Italian, French, German, Greek, even
Russian Maybe it's a prerequisite set by the union.
One day a party called our French restaurant asking for recom
mendation of a place serving English dinners. The closest we
could come was English-speaking waiters, stretching a point.
High school foreign language courses are poor preparation for
listening in on waiters' conversations. It's nice to know what they
may be plotting in fiont of you. In doubt, we always answer no.
N imbers were as far as we got in Spanish.
There are other drawbacks to a cashier's job. After counting an
average of four hundred dollars a day, five days a week, you're
not too happy at the figures showing up on your check. Of course,
too many times shoit during the week and you're lucky to get
what's on the right hand side of the decimal point in the figure on
the face of the check.
If things get too bad you can always lose yourself in the liquor
inventory work. That's thirsty work. Haig and Haig, Old Grand
dad, and Black and White are a recognizable trio, but's who's ever
hrard of Peppermint, Aperitif, and Violet Something oi-other. At
any rate, wine lists contain many beautiful names. How about
Chablis and Cabernet for your first set of twins?
All told, restaurant work widens one's horizons. Faced with
"how about a date, babe?" or related queries in six languages, you
learn fast. As I was telling Vivien Romance the other day, e'est la
guerre.
