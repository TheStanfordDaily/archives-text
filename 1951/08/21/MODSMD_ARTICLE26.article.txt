The colossus is upon us again.
It is only the 21st day of August, yet King Football has reared
his head. On the professional front several games are in the
books. And on the local scene preparati6ns are well under way
for the gathering of the Stanford horde Steptember 1.

Chuck Taylor has been meeting
with his staff in day-long confer
ences since the beginning of this
month.
However, with all the study, re
view, and preparation that has been
done, there is no way of prognosti
cating just how good Stanford will
be. or taking the dismal view, just
how bad they will be. The best one
can do, without causing alumni ex
cessive fear or joy, is to present the
facts only. Then you may color and
interpret thtm as you so desire, de
pending upon which side of the sta
lium you will be sitting come fall.
A good place to start is at the
ends. Good mainly hecause of one
Bill McColl who made everyone's
All-American. Bill Stornm will be
his running mate at left end. De
fensively there are stalwarts Jack
Kye and Mary Tennci'oss. Sam
Morley. up from the frosh, Al Kirk
land, a transfer, and veteran Ron
La d ie are being counted on to hold
up their end, so to speak.
Moving to the middle of the line,
there are many veterans who
played in the Big Game last year,
and who played the vaunted Cali
fornia line to a standstill. John
tJroderick. John Bonetti, Norm Ma
nopgian, Jim Vick. Owen Powell,
Leon King. Tsar Calfee. Jess Cone.
Hod Garner, and Dick Lucas will
all be back and it is up to Taylor to
decide who plays offense and who
defense.
Taylor'is counting on the services
v-l Gordy Rice, who sat out last
year's dance nursing a leg which
was broken iiT the Big Game of '49.
Carter Pyle and Boh Latham are
up from the JV'.% while Al Robert
son and Tod Turner were the main
stays of last year's once - defeated
frosh squad.
In the backfield lack of speed is
something that will hinder wide
open play and call for more power.
Go through instead of around the
opposition, will be the watchword.
Taylor says,"The fans will find us
less spectacular, but I hope more
consistent."
At quarterback Gary Kerkorian
ranks number one. His sharp pass
ing in last year's Big Game has
caused hope to flame anew in many
a heart. He is being closely pressed
by sophomore sensation Bobby

i Garrett. Dick Horn, who for three
years has been Kerkorian's under
study, will be played mostly on de
fense.
In halfbacks, Stanford is deep in
i material but not in experience.
Harry Hugasian is the one true vet
eran. Boh Bryan, who was tops in
speed and in punt and kick-off re-
I turns, will provide about the oidy
lightning in the backfield. Wes
Laubscher and Billy lieilhron, who
saw little varsity action last fall,
will get plenty this campaign.
There's also frosh star Ron Cook.
Defensively, Joe St. Gcme, Horn,
Boh Iloct;h. and Kerkorian will be
used. Kerkorian may be the only
team member to serve double duty
in Taylor's complete platoon plan.
The fullback spot may be the
weakest link, but yet. if things turn
out. it may be a link strong enough
to make an unbreakable chain. Skip
Crist is about top man on the to
tem pole, but climbing right behind
him is Bob Meyers, who did most of
the fullback chores in '50. Also
pushing is veteran Chuck Ksso",ian.
who was sidelined at the season's
close. And the big question mark
and perhaps the solution is Bob
Matliias. Bob. after two years of
track concenration, will turn out
this fall. He is an unknown quan
tity. but his potential is obvious.
As far as Chuck sees it. Stan
ford will be all right and would
I be capable of beating everybody
in the Conference if the game
was limited to II men against 11.
In other words, depth this year,
as in many past seasons, may
prove the Indians' downfall.
