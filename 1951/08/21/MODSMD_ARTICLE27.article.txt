# White in Pro Debut as '49ers Romp
## 
### 
By CIIUCK THOMAS
Bobby White, who hung' up his
College cleats at Stanford last year,
Jlooktd very good for a couple of
minutes in his pro football debut at
Kuzai Stadium Sunday. Which does
not mean that the '49ers'' rookie
halfback was resting on the oars
while his teammates were putting
the skids on the Washington Red
skins. 45-14.
The reason Bobby didn't sparkle
any longer than it takes an egg to
boil is that he didn't play any long
er than that. Even the more highly
publicized ex - Cal halfbacks, Jim
Monachino and Pete Schabarum,
didn't look too impressive while
they were on the bench — winch

| was. just incidentally, all afternoon.
White was in on one kick-off
| play, and did his share by breaking
through the interference to make a
I beautiful tackle on the Redskin ball
! carrier. The only time he carried
j the ball on offense, Bobby moved
i the line of scrimmage nine yards
| closer to the Washington goal line.
| All of which doesn't mean that
Buck Shaw is going to give Johnny
! Strzykalski a train ticket home and
start White against the Chicago
Bears come Sunday. Any more than
| a 45-14 victory over the Redskins
means the '49ers are going to come
I even vaguely close -to manhandling
George Halas' Monsters of the Mid

i way when they invade Kezar.
Granted that the '49ers—led by
former Indians Albert. Standlee,
land Banducci — showed very little
resemblance to the club that walked
ofl winners in only three out of 17
last year. But any simi
j larity between the Washington
Redskins and a football team —
which brings us back to the Bears—
lis strictly a shot with both eyes
| closed.
li Buck Shaw s '49ers are going
to strike gold this Sunday, they re
going to have to use both hands.
And with the Bears' Ed "Patty
cake" Sprinkle in the line-up, a
liberal helping of elbows and knees
will be in order, too.

Granted that the '49ers—led by
former Indians Albert. Standlee,
land Banducci — showed very little
resemblance to the club that walked
ofl winners in only three out of 17
last year. But any simi
j larity between the Washington
Redskins and a football team —
which brings us back to the Bears—
lis strictly a shot with both eyes
| closed.
li Buck Shaw s '49ers are going
to strike gold this Sunday, they re
going to have to use both hands.
And with the Bears' Ed "Patty
cake" Sprinkle in the line-up, a
liberal helping of elbows and knees
will be in order, too.
