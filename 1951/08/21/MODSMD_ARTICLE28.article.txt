In a recent championship volley
ball game held on the greens of
the women's athletic field, Euca
lypto edged Naranja 17 to 16 t<>
take the Lagunita crown. Naranjj,
the irosh casa. captained by Judy
Molloy, held an early advantage but
their bigger and perhaps more ex
perienced sisters overtook them i:i
the closing moments with a Jeanne
Crandall-inspired rally backed by
the emotional rooting of a Eucalypta
gallery. Girls' volleyball is played
on a time basis, thirty minutes.
On the swimming front, Sharon
Geary, a Stanford sophomore, gets
pictures and mention in the current
issue of Lite. Miss Geary is one of
the nation's leading contenders for
the AAU 100-meter swim".
