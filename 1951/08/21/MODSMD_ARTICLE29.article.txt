# Professional Quality Shown In Production of 'Madwoman'
## 
### KEN WATERS 
The Stanford Players closed their
summer season hist Saturday eve
ning with a very nearly professional
production of Jean Giraudoux's sa
tirical comedy '"The Madwoman of
Chaillot." Being profssional in tone,
the production exhibited two of the
qualities frequently evident upon
Ihe commercial stage. First, it was
.smoothly and efficiently run. Sec
ond, there was major emphasis
upon the star, Miss Aline MacMa
hon.
Happily absent from this produe
-1 ion were the stumbling and mis
<• ied speeches, the hackneyed sets,
}in<! Hat lighting so often witnessed
in the productions of many ama
teur groups. Though the characters
<nay have been somewhat stylized
the play demanded, there was a
freshness and individuality about
the production which is often hard
to find even in the more experi
enced circles.
Miss MacMahon gave a delight
fid performance as the Madwoman
of Chaillot, Aurelia. Her stage
esence, timing, and projection
were admirably suited to the de
mands of Memorial Auditorium,
which has defeated many a lesser
find more inexprienced actress or
actor because if its size and acous
-1 ics.
Almost on a par with Miss Mac-
Mahon were George Wilson as the
Ragpicker, Bernard Blumberg as
Dr. Jadin, Patricia Beverly as Irma,
and Asher Wilson as the Sewerman.
Jf particular note was the perform
ance of Raymond Barrett, whose
graceful pantomimes greatly en
hanced the role of the deaf mute,
rind Hugo Melchione's adeptness on
roller skates.
Barbara Welsh, Evelyn McCurdy,
and Celeste Ashley provided many
pleasurable moments in their roles
;ts the Madwomen ot' Passy, St. Su
plice, and La Concorde. Morgan
Stack, John Clark, and Bert Brauer
were properly effective as the stock
market magnates.
One of the major problems to be
•aced in any production of this typt
is the emphasis that is to be placed
upon the individual characters. A
well - balanced production demands
the proper emphasis upon each ac
<ur at the proper time. It was in this
< rspoct that the Stanford perform
nee failed to achieve perfection.
As excellent a role as the Mad
woman of Chaillot is, there were
many other fine characterizations to
be seen in the play. However, it was
ielt that these were, at times, neg
lected in order that Miss MacMa
hon might be seen more effectively.
Miss MacMahon is not only a fine
character actress; she is an adept
.ncene-stealer as was witnessed in
.several scenes during the perform
ance. Rather than acting as char
acters in a play, many of the actors
were often forced to become only

, background pieces against which
j the lady could display her talent.
Even with this criticism, however,
I the production was thoroughly en
joyable and Mr. F. Cowles Strick
' land, the director, should be com
j plimented upon his able casting and
! direction. Mr. Brockett's settings
were beautifully imaginative and
| contributed greatly to the over-all
production of the play as well as
| Mr. Brummr's lighting, though it
| was felt that the lighting changes
| were at times somewhat unsteady.
! However, it should be noted that
the Stanford switchboard has a
habit of giving a bouncy reaction to
| control. Miss Opsvig's varied and
i excellent costumes were also of
great importance to the stage scene
and the play.

Happily absent from this produe
-1 ion were the stumbling and mis
<• ied speeches, the hackneyed sets,
}in<! Hat lighting so often witnessed
in the productions of many ama
teur groups. Though the characters
<nay have been somewhat stylized
the play demanded, there was a
freshness and individuality about
the production which is often hard
to find even in the more experi

Miss MacMahon gave a delight
fid performance as the Madwoman
of Chaillot, Aurelia. Her stage
esence, timing, and projection
were admirably suited to the de
mands of Memorial Auditorium,
which has defeated many a lesser
find more inexprienced actress or
actor because if its size and acous
-1 ics.
Almost on a par with Miss Mac-
Mahon were George Wilson as the
Ragpicker, Bernard Blumberg as
Dr. Jadin, Patricia Beverly as Irma,
and Asher Wilson as the Sewerman.
Jf particular note was the perform
ance of Raymond Barrett, whose
graceful pantomimes greatly en
hanced the role of the deaf mute,
rind Hugo Melchione's adeptness on
roller skates.
Barbara Welsh, Evelyn McCurdy,
and Celeste Ashley provided many
pleasurable moments in their roles
;ts the Madwomen ot' Passy, St. Su
plice, and La Concorde. Morgan
Stack, John Clark, and Bert Brauer
were properly effective as the stock
market magnates.
One of the major problems to be
•aced in any production of this typt
is the emphasis that is to be placed
upon the individual characters. A
well - balanced production demands
the proper emphasis upon each ac
<ur at the proper time. It was in this
< rspoct that the Stanford perform
nee failed to achieve perfection.
As excellent a role as the Mad
woman of Chaillot is, there were
many other fine characterizations to
be seen in the play. However, it was
ielt that these were, at times, neg
lected in order that Miss MacMa
hon might be seen more effectively.
Miss MacMahon is not only a fine
character actress; she is an adept
.ncene-stealer as was witnessed in
.several scenes during the perform
ance. Rather than acting as char
acters in a play, many of the actors
were often forced to become only

, background pieces against which
j the lady could display her talent.
Even with this criticism, however,
I the production was thoroughly en
joyable and Mr. F. Cowles Strick
' land, the director, should be com
j plimented upon his able casting and
! direction. Mr. Brockett's settings
were beautifully imaginative and
| contributed greatly to the over-all
production of the play as well as
| Mr. Brummr's lighting, though it
| was felt that the lighting changes
| were at times somewhat unsteady.
! However, it should be noted that
the Stanford switchboard has a
habit of giving a bouncy reaction to

i excellent costumes were also of
great importance to the stage scene
and the play.
The Stanford Players closed their
summer season hist Saturday eve
ning with a very nearly professional
production of Jean Giraudoux's sa
tirical comedy '"The Madwoman of
