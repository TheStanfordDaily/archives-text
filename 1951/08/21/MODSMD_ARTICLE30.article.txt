### 
Time magazine, in its Aug. 20 is
sue, quotes Editor Kay Chapman's
editorial from the Aug. 13 Daily in
its roundup of reactions on the
Honor Code scandal at West Point.

found that most colleges take a
dim view of the workability of an
honor system, and that only one out
of ten "trusts its students enough
to maintain an honor system."
The article concludes: "'Crowed
the Stanford Daily: 'As long as
schools like West Point supposedly
have an honor code, Stanford need
not take pride in the mere posses
sion of one; but to have one that
worksâ€”that indeed is something to
shout about.' "
