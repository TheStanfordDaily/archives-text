# Excom Ends For Summer
## 
### 
The last Excom meeting for this
quarter will be held tomorrow in
the ASSU room, Union Building, at
7:o0 p.m. Several important mat
ters will be taken up, and all in
terested persons are asked to at
tend, said Brad Blaine, summer
president.
On the agenda will be discussion
of a number of recommendations to
be made to regular Excom in the
fall. One matter will be campus
recognition of the World Federalist
organization, and a student office
for the group on the campus.
Also to be taken up will be rec
ommendations on permitting smok
ing in the lobby of the Main Library
and on Inner Quad. Smoking was
permitted in the Library lobby this
summer, and it will be decided
whether Excom will recommend
continuing this practice during the
regular year.
On tomorrow's agenda will be a
report on the charity drive that
ended Sunday. A decision will be
made on the recommendation that
similar charity drives should be
held every summer.
The final report on a proposed
poll to invstigate social apathy on
the campus will be given, and a
decision made as to whether such
a poll will be recommended to regu
lar Excom for this fall.
According to summr Excom
members, the recommendations on
these matters will probably be car
ried out by this fall's Executive
Committee. Consequently, anyone
interested in these matters should
attend tomorrow's meeting.
