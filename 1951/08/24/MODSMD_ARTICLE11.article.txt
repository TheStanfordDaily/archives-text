# Excom Finishes Quarter With Eight Proposals
## 
### 
Summer Excom wound up the quarter's activities Wednes
day night with a set of recommendations to the regular Excom
which will take office at the beginning of fall quarter.
The first recommendation, made by Bill Otterson, was tha k .
no charity drive be held next summer. Otterson, chairman ot

j this summer's drive, gave several
reasons for abandoning summer
charity drives.
Pointing out that this year's drive
: fell far below its quota, he said
I there seems to be little interest in
the drive during summer quarter.
He added that no new method of
i creating greater interest in a chive
seemed practical.
To provide the money that would
ordinarily come from the drive, Ex
i com voted that an amount not to
I exceed $500 be taken front the
i ASSU contingency fund each year
i to reimburse the floating fund for
I charity donations.
Permanent Office
Excom also decided to recom
mend that the World Federalists be
allowed to retain a student oflice on
the campus. It was felt that the
organization was of sufficient im
portance to be represented on the
campus.
Another recommendation was
that next year's Excom review the
relation of the Institute of Interna
tional Relations to the ASSU con
stitution. It was felt that the lIR
I should act as a central clearing
; house for all campus organizations
j concerned with international affairs.
Other Recommendations
Other recommendations were:
1. That the no smoking rule in the
library lobby be permanently abol
[ ished.
2. That the summer student man
[ uger's salary be cut from $100 to
j $50 per month.
3. That the ASSU secretary be
| paid time-and-a-half for work af
j ter 10 p.m.
4. That tall Excom redecorate the
j ASSU room.
5. That one member of the Edu
i cation Council be appointed to the
| Fundamental Standard Committee
and the Honor Code Committee.
