# BULL SESSION
## 
### BEV BOCK 
Well, as the trite saying goes,
here it is almost the end of the sum
mer. We'll all be going home and
the poor people who had to work
or loaf this summer will crowd
around and ask how did we enjoy
our vacation on the Farm? And did
we mind getting up early to do the
chores?
Or, if they've heard more about
this particular Farm, they'll ask if
we spent our afternoons at I'ossot
ti's, nights at the Cactus Gardens,
and mornings in bed. And we'll
piobably say yes.
And then they'll laugh and say
wa. n't summer school easy? And
•whore's your tan from spending
Sundays at the beach?
To those people I'll say yes, it was
easy. No studying. No going to
classes. No A's. No B's. No allow
ance for next quarter. My parents
think I'm up here to learn.
As for the tan, I didn't get one.
Glad you mentioned it, though. It's
a long story and I'm dying to tell
it. so please be seated and listen
attentively.
1 did go to the beach one Sun
day. It was a sunny day. Until we
hit. the beach. God must have had
His umbrella up to keep out the
rain. It kept out the sun, too.
We spent the day shivering. Es
pecially the fools who went swim
ming. We huddled under jackets
and beach towels, pretending we
were warm and playing card games
likt "I Doubt It." Brave souls that
we were, we stuck it out until we
thought the sun had probably gone
down.
Then we had car trouble. Sunday

j in Santa Cruz is no place for car
j trouble, because all the garage
I owners have closed up shop. And
| it's no place to be in shorts like
I was, because it's cold.
We weathered it as best we could.
Only the weather almost weathered
us. The night felh as the poets say,
and we took refuge in the Grey
hound bus station. The people there
looked at us kinda funny. Maybe it
I was my shorts. Or maybe it was
the six of us standing there playing
"I Doubt It" on top of the pinball
machine!
Two of our unfortunate friends in
Paly were chosen to come down
and get us, which they did after
some protestations. We got home
;at 10:.'j0, on the nose. Still shiver
ing. Still in shorts. And I never
went back to the beach.
And that's why I didn't get a tan
this summer. But do you think
: anyone will believe it? I doubt it.

Only the weather almost weathered
us. The night felh as the poets say,
and we took refuge in the Grey
hound bus station. The people there
looked at us kinda funny. Maybe it
I was my shorts. Or maybe it was
the six of us standing there playing
"I Doubt It" on top of the pinball
machine!
Two of our unfortunate friends in
Paly were chosen to come down
and get us, which they did after
some protestations. We got home
;at 10:.'j0, on the nose. Still shiver
ing. Still in shorts. And I never
went back to the beach.
And that's why I didn't get a tan
this summer. But do you think
: anyone will believe it? I doubt it.
Well, as the trite saying goes,
here it is almost the end of the sum
mer. We'll all be going home and
the poor people who had to work
or loaf this summer will crowd
around and ask how did we enjoy
our vacation on the Farm? And did
we mind getting up early to do the
chores?
Or, if they've heard more about
this particular Farm, they'll ask if
we spent our afternoons at I'ossot
ti's, nights at the Cactus Gardens,
and mornings in bed. And we'll
piobably say yes.
And then they'll laugh and say
wa. n't summer school easy? And
•whore's your tan from spending
Sundays at the beach?
To those people I'll say yes, it was
easy. No studying. No going to
classes. No A's. No B's. No allow
ance for next quarter. My parents
think I'm up here to learn.
As for the tan, I didn't get one.
Glad you mentioned it, though. It's
a long story and I'm dying to tell
it. so please be seated and listen
attentively.
1 did go to the beach one Sun
day. It was a sunny day. Until we
hit. the beach. God must have had
His umbrella up to keep out the
rain. It kept out the sun, too.
We spent the day shivering. Es
pecially the fools who went swim
ming. We huddled under jackets
and beach towels, pretending we
were warm and playing card games
likt "I Doubt It." Brave souls that
we were, we stuck it out until we
thought the sun had probably gone
down.
Then we had car trouble. Sunday

j in Santa Cruz is no place for car
j trouble, because all the garage
I owners have closed up shop. And
| it's no place to be in shorts like
I was, because it's cold.
We weathered it as best we could.
