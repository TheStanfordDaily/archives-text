# A 						Disturbed Reader

I have been amused by The Daily this summer. I become dis
turbed, however, when I realize that The Daily speaks nationally
for Stanford, as was evidenced by the recent quote in Time maga
zine. What does our newspaper say for us in these days of loyalty I
oaths, congressional investigations, bribery in university athlet
ics, and cheating scandal? (And reduction in enrollment and
revenues and cutbacks in personnel?)
The Daily asks, "What good is food for starving people?" It
reports Excom's concern over social apathy. Its columns advocate
open professionalism in Stanford football. And it complacently
chortles about how good our Honor Code is.
I think the place for whimsy, irony, and irresponsibility is the
Bull Session. I only wish the editorial staff would screen their
material with this tn mind.
