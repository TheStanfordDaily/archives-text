### 
As the quarter draws to a close,
the Registrar's Office is more opti
mistic as U) the registration figures
expected next quarter. It was pre
dicted yesterday that instead of the
20 per cent drop in enrollment ex
pected in fall, the decrease will only
be around 10 per cent.
That prediction indicated that the
enrollment may reach 7,000, of
which around 5,000 are expected to
he returning students.
Chief Counselor of Men Richard
Balch said that while the number
ot students entering Stanford for
the first time next quarter will
probably be less than last year's
2,100, the number of entering fresh
men is expected to increase.
Next quarter's student body will
also reflect a decreasing number of
veterans. This decrease will be com
pensated for by the increase in the
younger age groups.
Apart from that, Stanford officials
are unwilling to predict the possible
effects of the draft on the student
body composition.
