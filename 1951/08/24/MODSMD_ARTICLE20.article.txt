# Bouquets from ASSU

Co-operation is the key to the planning of campus social events,
particularly during summer quarter when there is comparatively
informal organization. Since it would require nearly the whole
second page of The Daily to elaborate upon the assistance given
the social program by various people, a quick round of thanks
must suffice to express my heartiest appreciation to: the dormi
tory directors. Miss Crandall, Miss Keane, Miss Davidson, Mrs.
Loofbourow; the dining hall directors, Mrs. Riley and Miss Con
ner, for making Sports Day possible; the Women's Gym, espe
cially Miss Malm, for Co-Rec swimming; Miss Aten and the ASSU
office. I am grateful to The Daily, A Phi O, and the anonymous
poster painters for publicity.
The student body also joins me, I am certain, in thanking the
following chairmen of events: Lisa Thacker (Lagunita Open
House), Gigi Jansen and Ken Langendorf (Stern-Lag Dance), Jackie
Miller and Bob Sampson" (Sports Day), Hal Bean (Student-Faculty
Social), A 1 Goudvis (Watermelon Feed), Gigi Jansen, Steve Horn, !
and Bill Theiss (Sunday Coffee Hours).
