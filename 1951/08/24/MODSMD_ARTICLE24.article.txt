Hock your tuxes and convertibles, gang, and net your favorite bookie
on the phone. For a goodbye present, your old dad is going to let you in
on how to parlay the price of a brew into next quarter's tuition.
Here's a little limb-climbing that would make any self-respecting
gypsy drill holts in his crystal ball and take up howling. Looks like the
Indians may have it this year. So here's what they're going to do with
it—-and who to.
INDIAN HACKS Till] QUACKS —Oregon's new coach, Len Casanova,
inherits a bunch of family heirlooms who never had it, and a crop of
freshmen who probably never will. Duck soup for the Indians: 34-7.
1!I(« RED SMARTENS SPARTANS Last year Bob Bronzan fielded a San
Jose team whose only threats were Gene Menges, Billy Wilson, and Harry
Beck, 'lhis year's team is the same -minus Menges, Wilson, and Beck.
Look, ma, no hands: 42-115.
WOLVERINE SCARES KEDSKIN GREEN Michigan's offensive ace. are
all bye-bye. But Bonnie Oosterbaan has a strong defensive club, plus a
freshman team with a winning habit. An interesting afternoon at Ann
Arbor, and each guy leaves with the marbles he came with: 14-14.
ItRUIN GETS GRUEN— After Michigan's tricky single-wing, UCLA's
one-man ofTense will look like stacking Margaret Truman against Ava
Gardner. Red Sanders' baby-blue Bruin won't really net a whole watch.
But the Indian will give him the works, anyhow: 21-7.
INDIAN KIDES BKONC BAREBACK The Santa Clarans dearly love to
heat Stanford, and no doubt someday they will* Hut Oct. 20. 195], isn't
jc day. Actually, this year's Santa Clara eleven will probably resemble
i plow -ho> s<- much more than it does a bronco: 35-14.
SKY SAYS "MUSH," INDIAN SAYS 'HOW?" Nobody was drafted
up at Seattle this year, and football players just don't flunk out or grad
uate from Washington. With Hcinrich throwing. McElhenny running, and
the weatherman precipitating, the Cards will find tough sledding up north.
Like the man said, vou can't win them all: 20-14.
BIG RED CLOBBERS HIE COUGARS Nice trip south for the boys from
Washington State, but they should have brought the weatherman—and a
few dozen good linemen: 41-0.
INDIAN VULCANIZES TROJAN The Indians will be wearing their
white shirts in the Coliseum, and the men of Troy will think the Ku Klux
Klan is riding. The Trojan is better this year, but it wasn't ALL Jeff's
fault: 28-1.'5.
BEAVER'S NO'I SO EAGER Kip Taylor's Oregon Staters could all
ihe way this year - all the way to nowhere. The inconsistent Beavers
somehow always look the same to the Big Red, especially on a dry field
here at Stanford: 28-7.
II S BEEN A LONG. LONG TlME—loot's face it. Pappy's loaded. But th ■
law of averages applies to Big game just like everything else. If Cal gets
by Washington, they should come to the Farm with a spotless record. But
chastity just doesn't look good on Bears—and McColl hasn't been prac-

ticing those field goals jvist for the
qxercise: 17-14.
But don t make those New Year's
reservations in Pasadena yet. 1
haven't picked a winner all sum
mer. Just ask anybody at Lagunita.
Il should be a very interesting
season, though. Like Ava told me
the other night when she asked me
to go steady — there'll be lots of
passes knocked down, and even
some penalties for illegal use of the
hands.
But there'll !><> plenty of scoring,
too.
