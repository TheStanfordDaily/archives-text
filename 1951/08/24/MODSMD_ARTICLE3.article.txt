LONDON. Aug. 23 (TJP) Great
Britain threatened today to use
force if necessary to keep possession
of the world's largest refinery in
Abadan, Persia.
Evacuation of British personnel
from all Iranian oil fields and other
installations was ordered after the
failure of "rock bottom" negotia
tions with Iran for continued oper
ation of the expropriated British oil
industry after it is nationalized.
The Foreign Office announced
that all British employees of the
former Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., have
l>een ordered from the scattered
fields. They will assemble at Aba
dan.
The Foreign Office followed this
move with a second statement re
vealing that it will not give up the
Abadan refinery.
