## Reds Want To Resume Talks 
### 
TOKYO, Aug. 24â€”Red command
ers in Korea proposed today to re
sume the "suspended" Kaesong ar
mistice talks, while at the same
time accusing the Allies of trying to
kill the Communist negotiators.
Reopening of the talks, a formal
Communist protest said, must be on
the basis oi a "satisfactory reply"
hy United Nations commanders to
Communist charges of repeated vio
lations of the Kaesong neutral zone.
The protest, broadcast by both the
Peiping and Pyongyang radios,
made it equally clear that there was
nothing "final" in yesterday's break
in negotiations.
The request for a "satisfactory
answer" from the Allied side ap
parently was an attempt to place
responsibility for a break in nego
tiations, if it develops, on the United
Nations.
Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway labeled
as a fake incident the latest Ked
charge that the Allies tried to kill
the Communist truce team by
bombing and strafing the confer
ence city of Kaesong last Wednes
day evening.
