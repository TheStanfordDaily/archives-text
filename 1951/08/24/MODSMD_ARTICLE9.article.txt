# Social Changes Recommended For the Farm
## 
### 
Extensive changes in Stanford's
social program and a poll into stu
dent apathy were recommended at
Wednesday's Excom meeting by
Marshall Mayer, chairman of the
student committee for the study of
social apathy.
It was suggested that a poll of
professional caliber be made on the
Stanford campus to determine rea
sons for the lack of interest in stu
dent activities. Dr. George Spin
dler, sociology, Dr. Alfred Grom
man, education, and Dr. Paul Wal
j 1 in, sociology, were recommended to
act in advisory capacity in the in
vestigation.
Suggestions for the improvement
of Stanford social activities included
the recommendation that functions
originate on the lowest level of stu
dent organization, namely houses,
dormitories, clubs, and activities.
The committee also suggested that
the social program be set up so
that the frosh women are not forced
I upon freshman men as they have
been in the past. It was felt that
the men and women should rather
seek social companionship on their
own level of maturity.
The group believed that faculty
student relations could be improved
jit the University would shift some
jol the emphasis from gradaute to
| undergraduate students. It is felt
j that professors are now obliged to
give most of their attention to the
j graduates and to ignore the under-
I graduate.
Excom made the following rec
j ommendations for next summer's
social program:
Sport days and dances similar to
1 the Stern, Lag, Toyon affair be em
> phasized; there should be no stu
dent-faculty tea next summer, and
j some other plan, possibly on a de
partmental level,-••be found for .stu-
I dent - faculty social relations; the
I men's swimming pool should be
j kept open on Sundays, and the
women's pool should remain open
I later in the quarter.
