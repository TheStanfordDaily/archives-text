# Welcome to '55â€” Farm's Biggest Frosh Class Ever
## Pre-Reg Underway; 7;300 Expected For Enrollment Ratio to Drop To New Low 
### 
The largest freshman class in
Stanford history, an estimated
1,200, is expected to register
Monday and Tuesday, but total
enrollment will probably drop,
Harvey Hall, University regis
trar, said yesterday.
A total enrollment of 7,.100,
slightly less than last fall's figure
of 7,343, is expected. The figure is
considerably higher than early es
timates, made in the face of a se
rious draft threat that didn't ma
terialize.
The large frosh class is a result
mainly of late admission applica
tions of outstanding freshmen, Hall
explained. This is expected to cause
a bulge in lower division enroll
ment, while upper division and
graduate registration will drop.
Ratio Down
And the "ratio" is expected to
decline. A breakdown shows an ex
pected registration of 5,300 men and
2,000 women or a ratio of 2.65 : 1.
Ratio last fall was 2.75 : 1.
Despite the large frosh class, "as
far as possible" no new freshmen
will be housed in Stanford Village,
Hall said. Summer quarter fresh
man men, however, will probably
be housed there. Freshman women
will occupy two-thirds of Branner,
compared with one-third last year.
The surprise registration antici
pated by Stanford runs against a
trend of decreased enrollment faced
by many U.S. colleges. First-day
registration figures at the Univer
sity of California fell off to 4,991
compared to 5,531 a year ago. To
tal enrollment there is expected to
be some 2,600 lighter than last fall.
A moment of relief was provided
yesterday in the bustling regis
trar's office, enjoying its busiest
season, when workers took time off
to chuckle at a letter of application
that said in part, "I understand that
Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia are now affiliated . .
