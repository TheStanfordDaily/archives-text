# Pre-Reg Com Rises Early To Meet Trains
## 
### 
"Welcomc New Indians" was the
slogan written on posters and ban
ners throughout campus and carried
in spirit to each train-load of new
comers yesterday as the pre-reg
committee went all-out to greet the
Class of '55.
Starting with the arrival of the
(5:01 Starlight, pre-reg members un
der chairman Jack Blumbcrg met
every train of incoming frosh. The
first croup were taken out to break
fast to bide time over cups of coffee
until the dorms opened at eight.
While the frosh were personally
driven to their living groups from
the station, a special pre-reg truck
delivered their baggage.
Information booths were set up at
Palm Drive and at Embarcadcro to
aid any "lost sheep." On campus
over 73 posters told freshmen of
such Stanford traditions as "How to
become a Stanford woman," "Pos
fotti's," "the Pajamarino," "Save the
Axe Yell until Big Game," "Say
hello on Quad." and so on.
After the frosh were set up in
their living croups the first pre-reg
activity got under way with a wel
come assembly at Frost Amphithe
ater.
Wayne Alley, student hody presi
dent, cot the procram off on a
windy start (his notes were blown
away by the wind but quickly re
covered) and was followed (with
out any interruption from nature)
by Dean Winbigler, President Ster
ling and Chaplain Minto. The as
sembly ended with the sinqinc of
the Stanford Hymnâ€”a first rendi
tion hv the Class of *55.
