# You Picked a Good School, '55
## 
### 
Hello, '55! One day of pre-reg rush finished,
three more coming up and if you're a bit harried
by the pace of activities, sit back and relax with
this knowledge: Stanford is sincerely happy
to have you here and the pre-reg program is
just our means of making sure you get ac
quainted.
That Stanford is happy to welcome its largest
class in history must be obvious by now. Hand
shakes and greetings have a way of becoming
routine during the first few days of university
life, but the welcome to Stanford remains sin
cere. And let the Daily—your paper—add its
welcome right now.
Presumably you've come to Stanford to get
an education. A university provides a wonder
ful opportunity. You can learn from brilliant
and interesting people on the faculty. You can
learn from taking part in activities. You can
learn by just living in the unusual environment
which a university offers.
And the sum total of the learning processes
should add up to an educated person.
Now it would be a naive person indeed who
insisted that Stanford alone provides good op
portunities. Every college and university pre
sents to some degree an open challenge to
learn through classroom and campus. It's not
Stanford alone.
But just as any 11 men can make a football
team, it takes an extra good 11 men to be
champions. It takes an extra good school to
offer the right opportunities and challenges to

make the process of education sure and steady
and not hap-hazard.
Stanford has those "extras." Proof of an
extra interested student body is the fact
you're here today, three days prior to the
arrival of returning students. A large group
of students known as the pre-reg committee
have spent long hours planning this intro
duction to Stanford.
You'll find other "extras" among the faculty,
where top scientists and scholars are often top
teachers, too. Don't be afraid to question these
faculty members, especially your lower divi
sion advisers. These men and women are here
to help you.
Living group arrangements give Stanford
one of its very best "extras." Fraternities and
men's and women's residences work together
for the most part in a good balance, with a
minimum of snobbery. Delayed rushing and
housing of frosh in Encina, Roble, and Toyon
for the first year is an ideal situation.
You've heard lots about the Honor Code.
You'll hear lots more. And when you've
been here for a few guarters you'll realize
that it's one of our finest "extras."
And to add spice to the whole picture, get
set for fun because this campus likes a good
time. Hundreds of traditions and customs built
up through the years give the Farm a well
earned reputation as the West's most colorful
school.
Once more, welcome to Stanford, class of '55!
