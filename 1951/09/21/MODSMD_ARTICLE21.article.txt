# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE ATTENTION, CLASS OF '55 
Members of the Class of '55, you are about to become college bred,
i College bread—that's a four-year loaf made from the old man's dough.)
As the introductory step to becoming college bred, you are now being

swamped with messages and speeches from chairmen,
presidents, sponsors, editors, and other assorted well
wishers. I offer you the suggestion that you may
promptly forget what all these people tell you and
listen only to the information set down by your Bull
Sessioner. All else is superfluous.
(1) When you see a line, quick, get in it. At Stan
ford you have to stand in line for certificates, books,
meals, registration, tickets, and everything else worth
less and worth while. Consequently, when you see
a line, get in it and ask questions later.
(2) Don't feel badly if you flunk the English A
test. Herbert Hoover flunked it twice, and look what

became of him. When you are asked to define the parts of speech, re
member that an adverb is what you split infinitives with; that a con
junction is what you stall around with when you don't know what to
say; that a preposition is what you end a sentence with; and that an article
is a word of indefinite value, depending on whether you are writing a
telegram or a 1.000-word composition.
(3) Unlike high school, courses at Stanford are infinitely specialized.
Take, for instance, English 247 D—The Social Life of Minor Sixteenth
Century Poets in Guatemala. Or the course, co-sponsored by the Engi
neering and Biology Departments, Biology 172 C—Methods of Engineer
ing of the Black Widow Spider.
(4) M«n. take Course 327R, given by this chronicler—Methods and
Techniques of Staying Out of the Army.
(5) Finally, and this is important, keep New Year's Day open. Despite
red-thatched Chuck Taylor's protests, it is not entirely inconceivable
that Pasadena will require your presence that day. Or to put it more
succinctly, we may go to the Rose Bowl.
