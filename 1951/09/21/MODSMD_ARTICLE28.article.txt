# Here's Why Exchanges Hit Pre-Reg Slate
##

By JEAN MALTSEFF
When dinner is a coed deal,
life on campus can become very
interesting, especially to frosh.
That's why pre-reg com always
includes exchange dinners whsn
making up list of pre-school ac
tivities.
Many scoff at exchanges but many
! have found them stepping stones to \
pins unci engagement rings. It all j
depends. Exchanges are something '
like lotteries. You never know when
the right number might come up.
In one way. though, exchanges
are a sure tiling. You always meet
people. And when strolling down
! Quad it's always nice to have a '
lew people to say hello to. It's
lun to know the members of your
class and adds to the old Stanford
j spirit.
Boys always complain of the
sandwiching which frequently oc
curs. But you never hear com
plaints from girls about having not
one, but two male dinner compan
ions.
One of the main problems faced
by sponsors and pre-reg committee !
members in arranging an exchange j
dinner is matching heights. No mat
ter how carefully plans are made,
there's always at least one case of a I
six-foot four-inch boy pairing ott
| with a five-foot two-inch girl, while j
I a tall girl is left gazing down upon
j her short escort.
In spite of all their pitfalls, the
dinners are a great topic for dh- '
cussion in campus dorms far into
the night. They start off a new so
cial whirl in the campus world for
every frosh, a whirl composed of
faces first, first names next, and in
an amazingly short time, life-long !
friends.
