# Braves Open Season With Hamilton Field in Stadium
## 
### 
Although the Stanford varsity will open away from home for
the first time in over a decade, Stanford Stadium won't be lacking
action tomorrow afternoon.
The combined Braves-frosh team will host a tough service team
from Hamilton Field at 2 p.m. tomorrow in the Stadium.

Hamilton Field has already
played two games this year and
so has some experience under its
belt. Service teams are generally
stronger this year, and the flyers
have one or two players with pro
fessional experience.
Under the new PCC ruling, there
will be no freshman football teams
this year, but the starting Braves
lineup is dominated by yearlings.
There are seven frosh, two sophs,
and two juniors.
The starting end positions will be
manned by two '55ers, John Roberg
and Kay Smith. Sophomores Don
Harcourt and Bob Armstrong will
open at tackle, and freshman twins
Win and Wes Wedge hold down the
guard slots. Bob West is the center.
Hawaiian Dave Eldridgc has
been shifted from defensive half
to quarterback and will open in
the all - important signal - calling
post. Eldridge played quarterback
on the championship frosh team

two years ago. He is deadly on
quick passes and also a better
than average runner.
Junior Scotty McKay, the scat
back of the team, will cavort from
right half, and freshman Ron Nunn
is the starting left half. Another
yearling, Mike Anderson, should be
sparkplug of the team at fullback.
He showed a lot of power in last
Saturday's scrimmage.
