EUGENE, Ore., Sept. 20 (UP) â€”
Oregon's Webfoots, if blazing speed
is enough, have a chance against
Stanford's Indians in their Portland
battle Saturday afternoon.
1 Coach Lcn Casanova's first duck
eleven is loaded with wing-foots and
has plenty of "git up and go." He
said he is "more and more" pleased
with the way his Oregon squad is
shaping up in practice.
Dick Patrick, 207-pound senior
center and line-backer from Vale,

has been named game captain. He
will play on both offense and defense.
