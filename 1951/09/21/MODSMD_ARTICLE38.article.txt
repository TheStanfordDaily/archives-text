BERKELEY, Sept. 20 (UP)—Coach
Lynn (Pappy) Waldorf predicted to
day a "free scoring game" for both
sides Saturday when his University
of California football team meets the
University of Santa Clara in the
season opener.
Waldorf said "there is no question
but what Santa Clara has a better
team this year and it should be a free
scoring game and no shut-out for
either side."
The Bear coach said Don Robison
will do the punting and also see some
action in a few running plays, but
first string tackle Don Karpe will sit
the game out due to a knee injury.
