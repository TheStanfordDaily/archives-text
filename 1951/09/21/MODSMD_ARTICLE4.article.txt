FORKS. Wash., Sept. 20—Raging
forest fire forced evacuation of most
,>f this logging community's 2,000
residents tonight, but a grim crew
of weary men stayed behind to try
and save the town.
About 100 firemen were shuttling
back and forth battling numerous
•"spot" fires that broke out from
parks showering down upon the
town from the roaring forest in
ferno.
The fire started about 3:20 a.m.
in an old forest blaze that had been
smoldering east of hero. It covered
20 miles in 12 hours and for a time
this afternoon it was feared the
entire town might have to be given
up for lost.
