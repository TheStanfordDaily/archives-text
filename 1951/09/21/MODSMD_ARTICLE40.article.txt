### "DIGGER" ODELL 
One of the things that runs through a new freshman's mind when he
first sets foot on the Farm, and incidentally one of the few things that
aren't covered in any of the indoctrination speeches, is, "What about the
Indian teams?" "Are we going to the Rose Bowl?" "Will our cage team
go to the Invitationals?" "Will we take first in the CIBA?' And so forth.
As sort of an eye-opener, we'd like to run down the list and give you
a quick tally on Stanford's chances in sports for the coming year.
FOOTBALL: Don't take any bets on the Indian grid team this year.
That's the best advice we can give. With a new headman, a new coach
ing staff, and a lot of potential but unproven material. Stanford will have
the most unpredictable team on the coast this year. The Indians may net
do better than fourth this year, but they'll cause a lot of excitement and
very likely spoil more than one team's chances of playing New Year's
Day.
BASKETBALL: If Stanford makes itself known nationally this year
in sports, here's where it'll be. The Indians lose but one first-stringer
from tast year's squad that made a good showing, and will be well stocked
with material from last year's championship "best ever" freshman squad.
You can count on some of those sophomores to make names for them
selves. And with veterans like Jim Ramstead and Jim Walsh, the Card
cagers under the new tutelage of Coach Bob Burnett, who incidentally
should know the incoming sophs sitfee he coached them last year as frosh,
will undoubtedly be the team to beat.
BASEBALL: The Cards had a disappointing reason last year after
winning the CIBA in 1930. This year Coach Everett Dean, faced with the
loss of some of last year's first-stringers, will have a job of rebuilding to
do. He still has ace pitcher Joe Chez, though. Joe, who last year was
weakened by a touch of early-season pneumonia, can be countcd on to
come back strong, and is the Indians' big chance for baseball fame in the
1952 campaign.
TRACK: The Cards' chances in this department depend a great deal
on how healthy national Olympic decathlon champ Bob Mathias is after
football season. Stanford had a poor season last year, but with a few
good sophomores might make a strong comeback. The perennial champs,
USC, sure make track a tough racket on the coast.
This covers the major sports, but the minor sports will have to show
up for themselves. We can be counted on to do well in sports like swim
ming (PCC champs again, I bctcha), golf, and polo. Others like tennis,
crew, boxing, and wrestling—well, let's leave those for a surprise.


SHARPENING HIS SIGHTS—It isn't likely that Coach Chuck
Taylor will call on Bill McColl to win tomorrow's game with a
field goal, but he's practicing just in case.
