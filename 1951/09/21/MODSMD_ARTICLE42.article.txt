For the first time since the war, Stanford will not field a freshman foot
ball team.
This, of course, goes for the rest of the Pacific Coast Conference schools.
Instead of a varsity, Braves (junior varsity), and frosh team, there will be
a varsity and two Braves squads. The number one Braves squad will have

a schedule. The other won't. This is an un
wholesome and unnecessary condition, and so
a word is in order of how it came about.
Last year in the middle of the Korean War
crisis the cry went up with the force of a
Mario Lanza vocalization that "all the players
are going to be drafted." The powers that be
in the P.C.C. ran into a little room, feverishly
discussed the matter, and announced to the
waiting press that cometh 1951, freshmen
would be eligible for varsity competition.
This, of course would mean no freshman kick
ball.
At the time, this seemed like a smart move,
since, as in World War II the freshman could
fill in the draft-depleted ranks. No beefs yet.
However, it soon became evident that col-

lege students weren't going to he drafted in wholesale numbers. The
gentlemen who guide the ship of state in Washington, D.C., said, in effect,
"Our country needs college-trained youth. Let the kids have their fling.
Time enough to put them in the army as soon as they graduate."
Now the powers that be in the Pacific Coast Conference are intelligent
men. And they keep up on current events as much as the next man. They
realized that very few, if any, gridders would be drafted. (No Stanford
footballer has received his summons.) But when they had another meeting
last spring, did they reverse themselves? You know the answer. Stanford's
A 1 Masters and several others wanted to do away with the hasty decision,
but the majority voted for the status quo.
Football and the freshman of the various schools suffer for this. I talked
to a freshman the other day who had made all-league guard at Burlingatne
High School. When I asked him whether he was going out for football
here, his answer was in the negative. Were there a freshman team, his
talents wouldn't have been lost.
Boh Ghilotti, head frosh coach last year and now Braves coach, told
me that he hoped the ruling would be reversed next season. He remarked
that few freshmen will help the varsity this year, although there are
many talented yearlings.
Incidentally, Stanford freshmen teams have won the championship four
years in a row now. When Chuck Taylor was Papooses coach, his under
lings went three years in succession without a defeat. Then, last, year,
Ghilotti's squad lost only the first game (by one point.)
PREDICTION OF THE WLEK. Tomorrow, at 2 p.m., duck season opens
at. Multnomah Stadium in Portland. And Chuck Taylor and his bow-and
arrow armed Indians won't need any decoys to bag 34 ducks. The ducks
will gang up and knock over seven Indians . . . final score: Stanford 34,
Oregon 7.
Oregon has only two starters from a team that was worse than poor last
year. Stanford, on the other hand, has Rose Bowl visions. They should
win in a trot, unless it rains.
I'm going to take in the Cal game, which, my crystal ball (a tcchni-color
one) tells me wili be Cal 27, Santa Clara 14.
