# Yankees Beat White Sox In Clutch Performance
## 
### 
. NEW YORK, Sept. 20 (UP) —
Handy man Joe Collins of the Yan
kees crashed a three-run eighth in
ning home run today to provide a
5 to 4 triumph over the White Sox
that boosted their lead over idle
Cleveland to half a game and en
abled them to survive a panic-filled
ninth inning.
Trailing, 4 to 2 with Saul Rogovin
pitching powerfully for the White
Sox, Collins came to bat after pinch
hitter Johnny Mize failed in an at
tempt to do the same kind of job.
Phil Rizzuto had led off the inning
with a single and Mize flied out.
Working carefully on hot rookie
Mickey Mantle, Rogovin finally
walked him, putting it up to Collins.
The fill-in first baseman, who
works only because Mize's legs arc
worn out, picked out the second
pitch and hit it well into the lower
right field seats for the victory
blow.
Thus for the second straight day
the Yankees won a crucial ball game
although outhit. They beat the White
Sox, 5-3, although outhit 10 to 3.
They won today although outhit, 13
to 7.
This also proved to be an important
day in the national league as the
Brooklyn Dodgers beat the St. Louis
Cards, 4 to 3, to go AVz games ahead
as the second-place Giants lost to the
Cincinnati Reds, 3 to 1.
Lefty Art Shallock, who came in
to start the ninth for the Yankees,
got handsome assistance on the
first play from the inspired Collins,
who robbed slugger Eddie Robin
son of a hit by diving for a ground
er and tossing to Schallock just in
time. Robinson was a vital man to
retire because he previously had
hit a home run and triple. Phil
Masi grounded out, but Phil Rizz
uto, normally the steadiest of all
the Yankees, uncorked a wild
throw on an easy grounder by Jim
Busby, who was safe at first on the
error.

The victory put the Yankees at
91-54 in the won and lost depart
ment with a percentage of .628.
Cleveland has a 92-58 mark and .622.

kees crashed a three-run eighth in
ning home run today to provide a
5 to 4 triumph over the White Sox
that boosted their lead over idle
Cleveland to half a game and en
abled them to survive a panic-filled
ninth inning.
Trailing, 4 to 2 with Saul Rogovin
pitching powerfully for the White
Sox, Collins came to bat after pinch
hitter Johnny Mize failed in an at
tempt to do the same kind of job.
Phil Rizzuto had led off the inning
with a single and Mize flied out.
Working carefully on hot rookie
Mickey Mantle, Rogovin finally
walked him, putting it up to Collins.
The fill-in first baseman, who
works only because Mize's legs arc
worn out, picked out the second
pitch and hit it well into the lower
right field seats for the victory
blow.
Thus for the second straight day
the Yankees won a crucial ball game
although outhit. They beat the White
Sox, 5-3, although outhit 10 to 3.
They won today although outhit, 13
to 7.
This also proved to be an important
day in the national league as the
Brooklyn Dodgers beat the St. Louis
Cards, 4 to 3, to go AVz games ahead
as the second-place Giants lost to the
Cincinnati Reds, 3 to 1.
Lefty Art Shallock, who came in
to start the ninth for the Yankees,
got handsome assistance on the
first play from the inspired Collins,
who robbed slugger Eddie Robin
son of a hit by diving for a ground
er and tossing to Schallock just in
time. Robinson was a vital man to
retire because he previously had
hit a home run and triple. Phil
Masi grounded out, but Phil Rizz
uto, normally the steadiest of all
the Yankees, uncorked a wild
throw on an easy grounder by Jim
Busby, who was safe at first on the
error.

The victory put the Yankees at
91-54 in the won and lost depart
ment with a percentage of .628.
Cleveland has a 92-58 mark and .622.
