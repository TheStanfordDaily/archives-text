# Lunny Back To Coach Boxers
## 
### 
Ray Lunny, Stanford's varsity
boxing coach, is back on the Farm
after having spent a year hitch in
the Navy. Lunny, former California
state boxing champ, is recoognized as
one of the best coaches in colle
giate circles. He will have the serv
ices of his former assistant, 'Mai
Mynderse.
Mynderse urged all interested
men to sign up for boxing. He
pointed out that only a few veteran
ringmen remain, so every varsity
berth will be wide open.
Two boxing tournaments, the
novice tournament for beginners
and the all-university tournament

for students with previous boxing
experience, will be held in Decem
ber.
