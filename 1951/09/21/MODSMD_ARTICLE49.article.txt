Greetings to the Class of 1955!
The sixty freshman classes who
have preceded you here include
those who have been noted for
many things. Already you are dis
tinguished as the largest freshman
class to have entered Stanford, and
I am sure that in the next four
years you will distinguish your
selves in many more important
ways.
You are entering Stanford at a
time which, in some respects, is a
time of crisis. It is also a lime of
great opportunity. I am confident
you will be alert to those opportu
nities and take advantage of them
to the benefit of yourselves and the
Stanford family.

(Wayne Alley at 1!) is one of the
youngest student body presidents
in Farm hi.tory. Alley graduated
from Washington High in Port
land, Ore., in ISMS. At Stanford
he has been a member of Rally
Com, class excom, pre-reg- com
mittee, and has ehairmanned ral
lies and dances. He was elected
student bo:'y president last
spring.)
Stanford is now your University.
It does not belong lo a Board of
Trustees alone, or to a faculty
alone, but to all members of the
Stanford Family in conjunction.
And you are in number the great
est part of the Family; it was for
you that the University was insti
tuted.
Perhaps a successful life is large
ly the acceptance of challenge and
overcoming it. You have accepted
one great challenge in deciding to
attend a university; great beeause
you may make of yourself and of
Stanford what you will.
Education is found exclusively
neither in the classroom nor out
side of it. A student educates him
self, and his instructors and text
books are aids. A student may
listen or not, read or not; the choice
is his. If you decide to listen and to
read, 1 am sure the academic side
of your education will be a great
success. The social side will prob
ably take care of itself.
Nancy Erwin, vice - president of
the ASSU, joins with me in shout
ing a welcome to you and in wish
ing you the best of fortune at Stan
ford- WAYNE ALLEY

ford to take over his present post 1

later assistant director of admis
sions and assistant football coach. ;
During the wi.v years Balch was
a Navy ensign in a PT boat
squadron.)
It is a pleasure to welcome you
to the opportunities of a Stanford
education. There is no question in
the minds of many of us who have
met you and your parents that the
class of '55 shows promise of qual
ity along with unprecedented quan
tity.
The Resident Directors of the
men's halls, the Resident Assistants
of the dormitories and fraternities,
and the Sponsors will be anxious to
aid you in your introduction to
Stanford life.
Our wish for you, in these some
what unsettled times, is that you
achieve success commensurate with
your ability and interest. As mem
bers of the Dean of Students staff,
the Office of the Counselor for Men
stands ready to aid you with any
distraction that may interfere with
your primary job of gaining the
education that will prepare you for
the most productive citizenship in
the future.
Now, as members of the Stanford
Family, we hope that you will par
take of the advantages and respon
sibilities that are assumed at the
time of your admission. Congratu
lations upon your achievements of
the past! Our hope is that you
make a concerted effort to obtain
from the Stanford faculty the help
that will make for continued suc
cess in the future.

I extend to you young men and women who are entering Stanford Uni

here a great variety of opportunities for work and for play. It is up to you

Greetings to the Class of 1955!
The sixty freshman classes who
have preceded you here include
those who have been noted for
many things. Already you are dis
tinguished as the largest freshman
class to have entered Stanford, and
I am sure that in the next four
years you will distinguish your
selves in many more important
ways.
You are entering Stanford at a
time which, in some respects, is a
time of crisis. It is also a lime of
great opportunity. I am confident
you will be alert to those opportu
nities and take advantage of them
to the benefit of yourselves and the
Stanford family.

(11. Donald Winbigler became
Dean of Students July 1, re
placing Lawrence A. Kimpton,
now chancellor of the University
of Chicago. Dean Winbigler
headed the Placement Service
from 1 to 1945 and was regis
trar for five years prior to ap
pointment to his present position.
He is a graduate of Monmouth
College, 111., and received his
Master's and Doctor's degrees

Greetings to the Class of 1955!
The sixty freshman classes who
have preceded you here include
those who have been noted for
many things. Already you are dis
tinguished as the largest freshman
class to have entered Stanford, and
I am sure that in the next four
years you will distinguish your
selves in many more important
ways.
You are entering Stanford at a
time which, in some respects, is a
time of crisis. It is also a lime of
great opportunity. I am confident
you will be alert to those opportu
nities and take advantage of them
to the benefit of yourselves and the
Stanford family.

(Wayne Alley at 1!) is one of the
youngest student body presidents
in Farm hi.tory. Alley graduated
from Washington High in Port
land, Ore., in ISMS. At Stanford
he has been a member of Rally
Com, class excom, pre-reg- com
mittee, and has ehairmanned ral
lies and dances. He was elected
student bo:'y president last
spring.)
Stanford is now your University.
It does not belong lo a Board of
Trustees alone, or to a faculty
alone, but to all members of the
Stanford Family in conjunction.
And you are in number the great
est part of the Family; it was for
you that the University was insti
tuted.
Perhaps a successful life is large
ly the acceptance of challenge and
overcoming it. You have accepted
one great challenge in deciding to
attend a university; great beeause
you may make of yourself and of
Stanford what you will.
Education is found exclusively
neither in the classroom nor out
side of it. A student educates him
self, and his instructors and text
books are aids. A student may
listen or not, read or not; the choice
is his. If you decide to listen and to
read, 1 am sure the academic side
of your education will be a great
success. The social side will prob
ably take care of itself.
Nancy Erwin, vice - president of
the ASSU, joins with me in shout
ing a welcome to you and in wish
ing you the best of fortune at Stan

It is a pleasure to welcome you

education. There is no question in
the minds of many of us who have
met you and your parents that the
class of '55 shows promise of qual
ity along with unprecedented quan
tity.

sibilities that are assumed at the
time of your admission. Congratu

I extend to you young men and women who are entering Stanford Uni
versity as freshmen in 1951 the most cordial of welcomes. You will have
here a great variety of opportunities for work and for play. It is up to you
to choose intelligently the opportunities you will seize upon. If you choose
intelligently you will strike a balance between work and play which will
justify to yourselves, to your families, and to the University your attendance
here.
If you do not choose intelligently you will not achieve a proper balance
between work and play and there will be no justification for your attendance
here. In consequence of which your attendance will be terminated. The
choice is yours to make, but in making it you should remember that mem
bers of the Faculty are available to assist you.
It is my sincere hope that you will quickly find yourselves feeling at
home at Stanford. In the hope that we may contribute to making you feel
at home here, my wife and I look forward to having you as guests on the
afternoon of Wednesday, September 26. I hope that as many of you as
possible will give us an opportunity to meet you at our home at that time.
