# Auto Registration Stickers Required by Campus Police
## 
### 
Stanford's Police Department this
year as in the past will require au
tomobile owners to obtain registra
tion stickers to be displayed on the
car's rear window. Auto registra
tion will be at the Police Depart
ment. located at the post office end
of the Corporation Yard.
Only car owners who have not
registered before will be required to
get the stickers, and this will in
j elude all freshmen.
An ASSU bulletin on traffic ex-
I plains that auto registration is a
' source of information for police
files and serves as a gauge for plan
i ning of future parking and road
j construction.
In a run-down of traffic fines the
bulletin lists these violations:
Parking—s2.
Wrong way on one-way streets—
$2.50.
Stop sign violations — $2.50 up,
depending on speed of car at inter
section.
Speeding—so cents a mile for first
offense, increasing with each addi

tional offense.
Police expect some 4,500 cars on
campus, including University em-
Dlr>vees' cars as well as students'
and faculty. Approximately 200
parking spaces are reserved for fac
ulty and the physically handicap
ped. These spaces in seven areas
are marked, and students parking in
them are subject to fine.
To relieve crowded parking areas
the bulletin suggests students park
carefully, taking up no more space
than necessary; that students living
on campus walk to classes; and that
those who drive utilize less-used
parking areas such as the chemis
try and Health Service lots.
