# Big Red Machine Geared for Oregon Opener
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
An inspired Indian team led
by a spirited new head coach
opens the 1951 grid campaign
tomorrow against the University
of Oregon at Multnomah Sta
dium in Portland. Kickoff time
is 1:30. Stanford, 37 strong, ar
rives by plane at noon today.
The same marks many firsts. The
most important being the initial test
for the '31 Rerl Machine; the first
test of so many question marks and

I ifs in the current crop of Rose Bowl
■ hopes. Simultaneously Chuck Tay-
J lor will take his first test as new
Card mentor.
Tomorrow's game is a Conference
tilt ami if Stanford has intentions
of spending New Year's in Pasadena
they must win it.
Tomorrow also marks the first
time that Stanford has opened a
season away from home for as long i
as most folks can remember. There
was the USF game in San Fran
cisco in 1040, but that's too close to
home to consider away. Stanford ;
has not played in Portland since

1939.
Chuck Taylor was born in Port
land and the villagers are anxious
to tee what the home town boy has
produced on the Farm. There is
also just a wee bit of interest in
what new he;id coach Len Casa
nova, who is familiar to most be
cause of his fine Santa Clara teams,
will come up with in his first year
with the Ducks.
Now let's see who has what
and what they are expected to do
with it.
Stanford has a new coach in
Chuck Taylor who returns to top

j coaching honors after leading three
j undefeated Papoose frosh squads
j and spending one year as assistant
coach with the San Francisco For
j ty-Niners. The red-head has 25 re
turning lettermen and 13 non-block
winners.
The head master has been work
ing the boys. Drills started on the
first day of this month and two-a
day workouts have been run off for
the major part of the three-week
practice period. Taylor handles his
practices with timed precision and
a whip-cracking reminiscent of Si
mon Legree.

Sideline observers report that
the squad is rough, ready, and
willing. Such things pay off. To
morrow might be the first divi
-1 (lend.
There's little doubt that end is
Stanford's strongest position. All-
American Bill McColl will be at one
flank. Bill broke a nose and will be
wearing a nose guard. At the other
end Bill Storum is likely to start.
A 1 Kirkland, a transfer, Sam Mor
ley and John Steinberg, up from the
frosh, will sec picket duty. Defen
sively it's deep with Ron Eadic,

Jack Rye, Marv Tennefoss, and
Storum all back.
Tackle is well o.f with John
Broderick, Leon King, and Jim
Vick returning. Carter Pyle is up
from the JV's and is promising.
The guards are strong. Norm
Manoogian and Owen Powell look
to be offensive starters, while Jesse
Cone and Dick Borda will handle
defensive chores. Behind them are
Jack Bonetti, Bob Griffin, and Dick
Lucas.
The center of the line is weak
The center spot is now in the hands:
of Rod Garner. Behind him is Don
Tobin. On the defensive side, Gor
dy Rice returns after breaking a
leg in the '49 Big Game. He may
compensate for the graduation losj
of Russ Pomeroy. Ted Tanner. Tsar
Calfee, and Chuck Essegian will be
there along with Dick Steere from
the frosh. Under new man Joe
Reutz, the line will surprise many
with its blocking, tackling, charge,
and hustle.
In the backfield Gary Kerkorian
will get the quarterback call over
sophomore Bob Garrett mostly be
cause of experience.
But Garrett has it and will
make a QB name for himself he
fore long. Jack Bickel will see
action while Dick Horn has been
shifted to defen ive and punting
assignments.
Offensively at halfbacks it will be
Harry Hugasian, the one true back
field veteran, and Ron Cook, last
year's frosh star. Eric Southwood
and Charles Braze 1 will relieve.
At fullback the big question is
Bob Mathias. A bruised toe
has benched him during practice
and the starting role will probably
go to Bob Meyers with Skip Crist
backing up.
Defensively the backfield has
been under new assistant coach
George Lynn, from the University
of Oklahoma. Pass defense, which
was non-existent last year, has
been stressed. The defensive half
backs should be Joe St. Geme, a
veteran, and newcomer Norm San
ders. Dick Horn will start at safety.
At Oregon, Lcn Casanova, who
take; over an Oregon team which
lost nine games last year and has

only II Icttcrmen back, says his
club is green hut hustling.
The Ducks are thin at ena'.s. Em
ery Barnes, a defensive enrl, and
Monte Brethauer, offensive, are the
only men at the flank.
However, tackle is even weaker
with no last-year first-stringers re
turning.
At guard top man is D; 1 Clemen .
Behind him are Don McCauley,
Howard Allman, and Harry Mon
dale.
The centor spot will he handled
both on offence and defense by Dick
Patrick, who was a line-backer last
season.
Qusrterbacking * bores fall to
Hal Dunham, who throws a good
pass and saw limited action last
fall.
Bob Hoegh and offensive bad-
Bob Bryan will probably also sec
defensive action. However, it is the
desire of Taylor to install a potent

and e fleet ive platoon system, which
means 110 double duly.

Defensively the backfield has
been under new assistant coach

was non-existent last year, has
been stressed. The defensive half

An inspired Indian team led
by a spirited new head coach
opens the 1951 grid campaign
tomorrow against the University
of Oregon at Multnomah Sta
dium in Portland. Kickoff time
is 1:30. Stanford, 37 strong, ar
rives by plane at noon today.
The same marks many firsts. The
most important being the initial test
for the '31 Rerl Machine; the first
test of so many question marks and

I ifs in the current crop of Rose Bowl
■ hopes. Simultaneously Chuck Tay-
J lor will take his first test as new
Card mentor.
Tomorrow's game is a Conference
tilt ami if Stanford has intentions
of spending New Year's in Pasadena
they must win it.
Tomorrow also marks the first
time that Stanford has opened a
season away from home for as long i
as most folks can remember. There
was the USF game in San Fran
cisco in 1040, but that's too close to
home to consider away. Stanford ;
has not played in Portland since

1939.
Chuck Taylor was born in Port
land and the villagers are anxious
to tee what the home town boy has
produced on the Farm. There is
also just a wee bit of interest in
what new he;id coach Len Casa
nova, who is familiar to most be
cause of his fine Santa Clara teams,
will come up with in his first year
with the Ducks.
Now let's see who has what
and what they are expected to do
with it.
Stanford has a new coach in
Chuck Taylor who returns to top

j coaching honors after leading three
j undefeated Papoose frosh squads
j and spending one year as assistant
coach with the San Francisco For
j ty-Niners. The red-head has 25 re
turning lettermen and 13 non-block
winners.
The head master has been work
ing the boys. Drills started on the
first day of this month and two-a
day workouts have been run off for
the major part of the three-week
practice period. Taylor handles his
practices with timed precision and
a whip-cracking reminiscent of Si
mon Legree.

Sideline observers report that
the squad is rough, ready, and
willing. Such things pay off. To
morrow might be the first divi
-1 (lend.
There's little doubt that end is
Stanford's strongest position. All-
American Bill McColl will be at one
flank. Bill broke a nose and will be
wearing a nose guard. At the other
end Bill Storum is likely to start.
A 1 Kirkland, a transfer, Sam Mor
ley and John Steinberg, up from the
frosh, will sec picket duty. Defen
sively it's deep with Ron Eadic,

Jack Rye, Marv Tennefoss, and
Storum all back.
Tackle is well o.f with John
Broderick, Leon King, and Jim
Vick returning. Carter Pyle is up
from the JV's and is promising.
The guards are strong. Norm
Manoogian and Owen Powell look
to be offensive starters, while Jesse
Cone and Dick Borda will handle
defensive chores. Behind them are
Jack Bonetti, Bob Griffin, and Dick
Lucas.
The center of the line is weak
The center spot is now in the hands:
of Rod Garner. Behind him is Don
Tobin. On the defensive side, Gor
dy Rice returns after breaking a
leg in the '49 Big Game. He may
compensate for the graduation losj
of Russ Pomeroy. Ted Tanner. Tsar
Calfee, and Chuck Essegian will be
there along with Dick Steere from
the frosh. Under new man Joe
Reutz, the line will surprise many
with its blocking, tackling, charge,
and hustle.
In the backfield Gary Kerkorian
will get the quarterback call over
sophomore Bob Garrett mostly be
cause of experience.
But Garrett has it and will
make a QB name for himself he
fore long. Jack Bickel will see
action while Dick Horn has been
shifted to defen ive and punting
assignments.
Offensively at halfbacks it will be
Harry Hugasian, the one true back
field veteran, and Ron Cook, last
year's frosh star. Eric Southwood
and Charles Braze 1 will relieve.
At fullback the big question is
Bob Mathias. A bruised toe
has benched him during practice

An inspired Indian team led
by a spirited new head coach
opens the 1951 grid campaign
tomorrow against the University
of Oregon at Multnomah Sta
dium in Portland. Kickoff time
is 1:30. Stanford, 37 strong, ar
rives by plane at noon today.
The same marks many firsts. The
most important being the initial test
for the '31 Rerl Machine; the first
test of so many question marks and

I ifs in the current crop of Rose Bowl
■ hopes. Simultaneously Chuck Tay-
J lor will take his first test as new
Card mentor.
Tomorrow's game is a Conference
tilt ami if Stanford has intentions
of spending New Year's in Pasadena
they must win it.
Tomorrow also marks the first
time that Stanford has opened a
season away from home for as long i
as most folks can remember. There
was the USF game in San Fran
cisco in 1040, but that's too close to
home to consider away. Stanford ;
has not played in Portland since

1939.
Chuck Taylor was born in Port
land and the villagers are anxious
to tee what the home town boy has
produced on the Farm. There is
also just a wee bit of interest in
what new he;id coach Len Casa
nova, who is familiar to most be
cause of his fine Santa Clara teams,
will come up with in his first year
with the Ducks.
Now let's see who has what
and what they are expected to do
with it.
Stanford has a new coach in
Chuck Taylor who returns to top

j coaching honors after leading three
j undefeated Papoose frosh squads
j and spending one year as assistant
coach with the San Francisco For
j ty-Niners. The red-head has 25 re
turning lettermen and 13 non-block
winners.
The head master has been work
ing the boys. Drills started on the
first day of this month and two-a
day workouts have been run off for
the major part of the three-week
practice period. Taylor handles his
practices with timed precision and
a whip-cracking reminiscent of Si
mon Legree.

Sideline observers report that
the squad is rough, ready, and
willing. Such things pay off. To
morrow might be the first divi
-1 (lend.
There's little doubt that end is
Stanford's strongest position. All-
American Bill McColl will be at one
flank. Bill broke a nose and will be
wearing a nose guard. At the other
end Bill Storum is likely to start.
A 1 Kirkland, a transfer, Sam Mor
ley and John Steinberg, up from the
frosh, will sec picket duty. Defen
sively it's deep with Ron Eadic,

Jack Rye, Marv Tennefoss, and
Storum all back.
Tackle is well o.f with John
Broderick, Leon King, and Jim
Vick returning. Carter Pyle is up
from the JV's and is promising.
The guards are strong. Norm
Manoogian and Owen Powell look
to be offensive starters, while Jesse
Cone and Dick Borda will handle
defensive chores. Behind them are
Jack Bonetti, Bob Griffin, and Dick
Lucas.
The center of the line is weak
The center spot is now in the hands:
of Rod Garner. Behind him is Don
Tobin. On the defensive side, Gor
dy Rice returns after breaking a
leg in the '49 Big Game. He may
compensate for the graduation losj
of Russ Pomeroy. Ted Tanner. Tsar
Calfee, and Chuck Essegian will be
there along with Dick Steere from
the frosh. Under new man Joe
Reutz, the line will surprise many
with its blocking, tackling, charge,
and hustle.
In the backfield Gary Kerkorian
will get the quarterback call over
sophomore Bob Garrett mostly be
cause of experience.
But Garrett has it and will
make a QB name for himself he
fore long. Jack Bickel will see
action while Dick Horn has been
shifted to defen ive and punting
assignments.
Offensively at halfbacks it will be
Harry Hugasian, the one true back
field veteran, and Ron Cook, last
year's frosh star. Eric Southwood
and Charles Braze 1 will relieve.
At fullback the big question is
Bob Mathias. A bruised toe
has benched him during practice
and the starting role will probably
go to Bob Meyers with Skip Crist
backing up.
Defensively the backfield has
been under new assistant coach
George Lynn, from the University
of Oklahoma. Pass defense, which
was non-existent last year, has
been stressed. The defensive half
backs should be Joe St. Geme, a
veteran, and newcomer Norm San
ders. Dick Horn will start at safety.
At Oregon, Lcn Casanova, who
take; over an Oregon team which
lost nine games last year and has

only II Icttcrmen back, says his
club is green hut hustling.
The Ducks are thin at ena'.s. Em
ery Barnes, a defensive enrl, and
Monte Brethauer, offensive, are the
only men at the flank.
However, tackle is even weaker
with no last-year first-stringers re
turning.
At guard top man is D; 1 Clemen .
Behind him are Don McCauley,
Howard Allman, and Harry Mon
dale.
The centor spot will he handled
both on offence and defense by Dick
Patrick, who was a line-backer last
season.
Qusrterbacking * bores fall to
Hal Dunham, who throws a good
pass and saw limited action last
fall.
Bob Hoegh and offensive bad-
Bob Bryan will probably also sec
defensive action. However, it is the
desire of Taylor to install a potent

and e fleet ive platoon system, which
means 110 double duly.
