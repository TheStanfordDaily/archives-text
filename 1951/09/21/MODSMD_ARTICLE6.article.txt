# Big Red Machine Geared for Oregon Opener
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
An inspired Indian team led
by a spirited new head coach
opens the 1951 grid campaign
tomorrow against the University
of Oregon at Multnomah Sta
dium in Portland. Kickoff time
is 1:30. Stanford, 37 strong, ar
rives by plane at noon today.
The same marks many firsts. The
most important being the initial test
for the '31 Rerl Machine; the first
test of so many question marks and

I ifs in the current crop of Rose Bowl
■ hopes. Simultaneously Chuck Tay-
J lor will take his first test as new
Card mentor.
Tomorrow's game is a Conference
tilt ami if Stanford has intentions
of spending New Year's in Pasadena
they must win it.
Tomorrow also marks the first
time that Stanford has opened a
season away from home for as long i
as most folks can remember. There
was the USF game in San Fran
cisco in 1040, but that's too close to
home to consider away. Stanford ;
has not played in Portland since

1939.
Chuck Taylor was born in Port
land and the villagers are anxious
to tee what the home town boy has
produced on the Farm. There is
also just a wee bit of interest in
what new he;id coach Len Casa
nova, who is familiar to most be
cause of his fine Santa Clara teams,
will come up with in his first year
with the Ducks.
Now let's see who has what
and what they are expected to do
with it.
Stanford has a new coach in
Chuck Taylor who returns to top

j coaching honors after leading three
j undefeated Papoose frosh squads
j and spending one year as assistant
coach with the San Francisco For
j ty-Niners. The red-head has 25 re
turning lettermen and 13 non-block
winners.
The head master has been work
ing the boys. Drills started on the
first day of this month and two-a
day workouts have been run off for
the major part of the three-week
practice period. Taylor handles his
practices with timed precision and
a whip-cracking reminiscent of Si
mon Legree.

Sideline observers report that
the squad is rough, ready, and
willing. Such things pay off. To
morrow might be the first divi
-1 (lend.
There's little doubt that end is
Stanford's strongest position. All-
American Bill McColl will be at one
flank. Bill broke a nose and will be
wearing a nose guard. At the other
end Bill Storum is likely to start.
A 1 Kirkland, a transfer, Sam Mor
ley and John Steinberg, up from the
frosh, will sec picket duty. Defen
sively it's deep with Ron Eadic,
