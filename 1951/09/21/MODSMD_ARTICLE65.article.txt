This, Mr. and Miss Stanford
Freshman, is The Daily, your Daily.
For the next four years this publi
cation will be your constant break
fast companion, and possibly your
classroom companion as well.
The Peninsula's best and only
morning newspaper is issued five
times a week by one of the largest
college paner staffs in the country.
Although the Shack, which
houses The Daily, is rather rustic,
to say the least, within its confines
are the latest equipment. A United
Press teletype brings the latest
news of world events, and the Daily
you read each nv * ,: .ng will include
the top stories received up to press
time, midnight, the night before.
Also at the Dippy's disposal (why,
no one knows, but The Daily is
often alfeclionately called the Dip
py) is a Fairchild photo-electric
engraver. This enables the paper to
photograph, develop, engrave, and
have ready for printing any local
news event, all within 3U minutes.
Story is made into type and type
into newspaper just three steps be
hind the Shack, in the
And after The Daily goes to bed at
12 o'clock, the presses roll through
the rest of the night, and then the
paper is distributed to the various
living groups and other sites on
campus.
With its ranks depleted by last
June's graduation, The Daily is
seeking new workers, both on the
editorial and business sides. Next
week The Daily will begin its for
mal tryoutee program for new re
porters.
The editorial side has nothing
more to offer its workers than a
lot of hard work, possibly ulcers,
but plenty of fun and friends. Un
der a plan instituted this year, how
ever, the biz stafT receives cash
commissions for ads solicited. So
watch next week's Daily lor an
nouncement of the tryout program.
Until then, drop in and look over
the Shack.
