# The 						Lines Remain as Registration Continues Today
## Opening Day Reg Figure Hits 4,722 Registrar Expects 7300 Total; System Called "Successful" 
### 
The Pavilion, scene of registration, was a litter of strewn cards
and rubble, and there were still fairly deep lines for signing class
lists at 5 yesterday afternoon. And Registrar Harvey Hall had
had a busy day.
"4,722 went through the mill today," he said, "but I won't know
how tiiis jiles with our total csti- I

mate of 7,300 until its ail over to
morrow." Yesterday's figure breaks
down to 3,371 mm and 1.351 women,
or a ratio of approximately 2.5:1.
Hid thought things went "pretty
smoothly in the morning," but the
inevitable lines formed in the after
noon. He thought the new system of
.slowing down the number of students
entering registration machinery was
successful.
Students with last names beginning
with S through Z register today
starting at 8 a.m. Those who failed to
l epo.-t in accordance with yesterday's
alphabetical schedule, both new and
old students, may pick up registration
books between 2:45 and 4:30 p.m. this
afternoon.
Students who take out books after
today will be subject to a late regis
tration fee. Following is today's
schedule:
Group Hours Entrance
S-T 8:00- 9:00 East
U-Z 9:00-10:00 West
A-D 10:00-11:00 East
E-K 11:00-11:45 West
L-R 1:00- 1:45 East
S-Z 1:45- 2:30 West


BEFORE—This is what Reg day looked like before a new sys
tem was established. Stanford students before 1948 had to
struggle for every seat card, often spending their whole day
getting into classes.


AFTER—This picture, taken yesterday, looks like another mob scene but actually things were
smooth compared to the days before '48 and the big switchover. The procedure was the smooth
est ever, according to Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler.


STILL—The bookstore line still poses a problem for those interested in getting their books early.
But this system, also, has undergone changes for the better in the past few years.
