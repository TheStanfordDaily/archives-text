# New Draft Law Changes Status of Deferred Men
## 
### 
A student who has been de
ferred once for reason of his be
ing enrolled to complete his
academic year may not again be
deferred by the statutory provi
sion of the new draft law, al
though he may be deferred by
his local draft board on the basis
of his standing or test score.
This new interpretation of the edu
cation provision of the selective serv
ice act was outlined along with seven
other items of interest to Stanford
men in a bulletin released last week
by Richard Balch, chief counselor for
men.
The mimeographed bulletin was
sent to university staff and is being
displayed on some living group bulle
tin boards.
The Changes
The new law states that: "Any per
son who while satisfactorily pursu
ing a full-time course of instruction
at a college ... is ordered to report
for induction under this title, shall,
| upon the facts being presented to the
| local board, be deferred until the end
of such academic year . . ."
The changes include a new inter
( pretation of the academic year. Un
der the old law induction was post
poned only until the end of the insti
] tution's academic year (nine months),
j whereas the new law defers the stu
dent for a full calendar year follow
| ing his enrollment.
Also under the new act, any per
| son who is deferred for any reason
j (educational or otherwise) "shall re
main liable for training and service
until the thirty-fifth anniversary of
the date of his birth" rather than 26.
Referring to all male citizens of the
I United States and others admitted to

the United States for permanent rcsi
dence, the new law lowers the age for
liability to 18 years six months.
Men will also be required to serve
24 months instead of 21 months as
stipulated under the old act.
Tests as Guides
Above all, Balch explained that
test scores obtained from the Selec
tive Service Qualification test or
student's class standing will be used
only as guides to draft boards in con
sidering deferment. Neither the tevt.
scores or class standing will make
deferment obligatory.
The men's counselor also an
nounced that Selective Service Qual
ification tests will probably be sched
uled sometime this year for those
students who have not previously
taken them.
Balch urges that all men students
be careful to give exact information
on the military status cards which
are being issued as part of registra
tion procedure. Of particular im
portance are the selective service
number and local board address
asked for on the card.
Using the information on the card:;,
the Men's Counselor's Office will send
certification of university enrollment,
to the local boards of all draft eligible
men.
