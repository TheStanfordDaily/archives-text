# Your Paper, Your Policy
## 
### 
We're off again—another quarter of classes
and midterms and finals, another season of foot
ball dances and rallies, another three
months of reading (sometimes griping about,
but always reading), The Daily.
And to keep in the pattern, it's time for The
Daily's usual declaration of policy, which
changes slightly through the years.
It is still the policy of this staff, and it always
will be, to put out an interesting and informa
tive newspaper. Such is the object of every
newspaper. Yet The Daily, as a college publi
cation, must also function as a bulletin board
tor university, club, and organization notices.
Every new editor, every new editorial board
strives tor a better combination of the paper's
several functions — presenting campus and
world news, offering outstanding features, com
menting on student problems, and telling club
members when to meet.
As far as editorial policy is concerned, de
cisions are made by the all-student editorial

board. In such decisions, the board attempts to
express the opinion of the majority of students,
after first giving consideration to both sides of
the issue.
In regards to v/orld news, the Dippy does not
attempt to ccmpcte with the metropolitan news
papers in quantity. But we can, do, and will
offer the latest and the most important news of
the world from our wire service.
But we on the paper do not want to do all
the writing. Nor do we want ours to be the only
voice raised in student issues. The Daily is
always seeking letters to the editor on any
topic. Our only request is that you sign your
name and address. If there is good reason that
the writer's name be withheld, we will do so.
We also reserve the right to limit the letters
to 250 words in length.
One more thing a reader of The Daily should
know. All editorials written by the editor will
be unsigned; those written by other members
of the editorial board will close with the
author's initials, like this- 8.8.
