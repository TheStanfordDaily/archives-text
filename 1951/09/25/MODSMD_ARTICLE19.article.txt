						New Law Hits the Campus
## 
### 
A new California state liquor law, as power
ful in its way as the stuff that comes in tho
bottles, went into effect last Friday. The law is
printed below.
To say that Stanford students are affected is
putting it mildly. The law amounts to a strict
prohibition for persons under 21 and is en
forced with heavy punishments.
Ever lend an ID card to an under-21 friend?
Perhaps you've used a false ID at some time.
Under the new law, if you are caught you are
guilty of a misdemeanor. Maximum penalty is
a S5OO fine and or a six months jail term. That's
rough.
State Senator Harry L. Parkman, represent
ing California's 21st district of San Mateo
County, told The Daily that the law is intended

to put more responsibility on the person buying
the drink. He said the old law put the burden
of proof on the bartender alone. The bill passed
with little or no objection, and will be strictly
enforced, he said.
The new lav/ is not realistic, of course. The
legislators v/ould be naive to assume that
minors will stop drinking because of the law.
It is especially unrealistic for a college com
munity.
But unrealistic or not, the bill is law. Many
students won't be affected at all. Many others
will have to work out the problem individually.
Certainly RA's, sponsors, and heads of various
campus groups will have to think twice before
scheduling some off-campus parties. Look over
the law now and save trouble later.
