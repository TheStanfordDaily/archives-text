# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
I want to announce to Mr. and Mrs. North and South
America and all the ships at sea that a myth should
bt exploded. It's the myth about nine out of ten
women being beautiful and the tenth going to Stan
ford.
It pains me to admit this. Because I came to Stanford
a f< w days early this year, riding high on my journal
istic horse; I was going to write an expos* on Stanford

women. I was going to tell them
to their collective face that they
were topographical errors.
Then I was going to quip that
Purm femmes were modest, be
cause they had plenty to be
modest ahout. Next 1 was going
to throw in a crack about one
of the blind dates I got last year.
Iler teeth looked like her tonsils
had yelled fire, and they were
running to get out of her mouth.

And her painted fir.,emails looked like six gold-fish
in a sieve.
Then I was all prepared to remark that Stanford
women looked like swans (referring to the downs on
their chins.)
I his would be great sport. The male population
would appreciate it.and my cheeky impudence would
induce laughter. In bass and baritone. Perhaps the
menfolks would put a few busts of me at eonspieious
spots on the cfempus to show their appreciation. Then

I
Header's Digest 01 Time mieht pick up my barbed
wit and reprint it. The whole country would titter.
Arid in It-; time than it takes to .say Johnny Olzsewski,
I d be a hero.
This is th?, way * had it planned. Hut it never
turm (I out that way.
1 arrived on campus and started looking over the
field, list to confirm mv article. Then I did a second
take, i'itis couldn't he! Here was real, genuine
feminine pulchritude. 'I lie place was abounding with
it. 'I hen were anatomic bombs all over the place.
. . . renters of abhhtraction.
#
And so that the story. An age-old myth has been
exploded. The busts will have to go, and Time and
Heath r : Dit;--st wiil have to look other places for wit.
And instead of being a hero, I'm just another obscure
journalist, tiyin ■ to meet a deadline.

Beft.re putting (bis column to bed for today, I
want to pass the word along that the reg lines are
supposed t>i be shorter this year. This is good news,
warranting a hi , si\ and a locomotive.
I teniember last year that the lines were so long
that a gremlin I bought from a salesman had to come
through CARE. My reg line went through the post
office. 1 don t know whether it was slow or not, but
when I passed (In- post office window, I picked up a
Hopalong Caj iday 1 ing in the mail, and by the time
the line had rea< bed the door, it had turned green.

supposed t>i be shorter this year. This is good news,
warranting a hi , si\ and a locomotive.
I teniember last year that the lines were so long
that a gremlin I bought from a salesman had to come
through CARE. My reg line went through the post
office. 1 don t know whether it was slow or not, but
when I passed (In- post office window, I picked up a
Hopalong Caj iday 1 ing in the mail, and by the time
the line had rea< bed the door, it had turned green.

I want to announce to Mr. and Mrs. North and South
America and all the ships at sea that a myth should

women being beautiful and the tenth going to Stan
ford.
It pains me to admit this. Because I came to Stanford
a f< w days early this year, riding high on my journal
istic horse; I was going to write an expos* on Stanford

women. I was going to tell them
to their collective face that they
were topographical errors.

Purm femmes were modest, be

to throw in a crack about one
of the blind dates I got last year.
Iler teeth looked like her tonsils
had yelled fire, and they were
running to get out of her mouth.

And her painted fir.,emails looked like six gold-fish
in a sieve.
Then I was all prepared to remark that Stanford
women looked like swans (referring to the downs on
their chins.)
I his would be great sport. The male population
would appreciate it.and my cheeky impudence would
induce laughter. In bass and baritone. Perhaps the
menfolks would put a few busts of me at eonspieious
spots on the cfempus to show their appreciation. Then
