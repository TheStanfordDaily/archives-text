# Promising Cards Dump Ducks
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Stanford's 1951 Big Red Machine sputtered once or t*ice, shifted into second, then into high
gear in the second guarter, chugged like a real football team for most of two periods, then ran out
of gas amid a flurry of penalties, but held on to hang a 27 to 20 defeat on Oregon in its opener with
the Ducks last Saturday at Portland.
While they were clicking, the Indians really looked like a comer. Harry Hugasian at left half

looked like the hipster of old as he
sprinted for consistent good gains.
Bob Meyers boomed the line like a
real smashing fullback, and his efforts
paid off with 96 yards in 16 carries,
the most yardage and best average of
any Stanford ballpacker.
QB Gary Kerkorian thought and
passed a fine ballgame, Jess Cone was
in on more tackles than centipedes
have legs, and Joe St. Gene was right
where he was needed time and again
on pass defense.
Cas and Squad Deserve Praise
But it was Oregon's Coach Len Cas
anova and 190-pound fullback Tom
Novikoff who carried off the honors
of the day. Cassanova's well-coached
frosh, anchoring an aggregation thinly
sprinkled with veterans and letter
men, proved themselves alert enough

I to spring two scores before the In
dians really got rolling, then drive for
j another alter the Cai,-dinal Chariot
j had mired down in the final quarter.
Novikoff, ran, passed (2 for 2),
1 punted, blocked, kicked conversions
| and kickoffs, and generally proved
himself the outstanding back, if not
ballplayer on the field.
Here's how the scoring ran, in case
you have been in a coma since the
j morn of last Saturday:
After Ron Cook and Bob Meyers
j each fumbled to give Oregon two
! chances inside the Indian 40, the
VVebfoots drove to the 24 in seven
plays. On the eighth QB Hal Dunham
faded and spiraled toward Bob Ash
worth in the end one. Stanford safety
I Dick Horn batted the ball, but into
the air and thence into Ash worth's

waiting arms for the score. Novikoff
booted the seventh point.
Indians Come Back
The Cards came right back in the

ensuing kickoff. After being aided in
their drive by two Oregon penalties,
they scored from the Webfoot 26,
when Kerkorian threw to Hugasian
who could have built a tepee while he
waited in the promised land. Kerk's
boot was wide to the right.
Oregon's total was 13 just two

minutes later when a beautiful 62-
scoot by left half Tom Edwards set
up Novikoff's 2-yard buck and first
of his two scores.
But the Indians had the Machine

running by now and again taking the j
kickoff ground their way 57 yards I
in eleven plays—all on the ground.
After three .straight bucks inside the
ten and with Meyers Hanking to
spread the defense, Hugasian went
straight over right guard from one
and a half yards out. Kerkorian con
verted to tie up the ballgame.
Kerkorian passed to MeColl, con- I
founding the Ducks by playing right '
instead of left end, from the Oregon
26 for Stanford's third TD in the first :
half, and the quarterback's talented I
toe quickly made it 20 to 13.
The game score began to look more
like the experts' form charts when
the Indians scored their fourth touch
down midway in the third quarter on
a 28-yard toss from Hugasian to Mc-
Co!l.
Penalties, Fumbles Hurt
However, three penalties and a
backfield fumble in five plays com
pletely snowed the Stanford offense
and Oregon began to roll. From his
own 28 Dunham pitched to NovikofT
for eleven; Tom Lyon made five;

Dunham again complete to left end
Dick Davenport on the Stanford 40.
Two more completed passes and it
was first and four to the goaline.
Novikoff bucked thrice. On his
fourth try, the ref, much to the In
dian's surprise counted him over for
the score.
Seven minutes later any potential
significance of the doubtful touch
down was gone as Marv Tennefoss,
playing a competent game at defen
sive right end, snuffed out a final
Webfoot threat by intercepting, a
Dunham pass intended for Davenport
on the Stanford 20.
