SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 24 (UP)
â€”Santa Clara's Dick Gallagher to
day called California an overrated
football team.
Galagher told the San Francisco
football writers the Bears "miss the
halfback blocking of Pete Schaba
rum and Jim Monachino. And we
did things to their line this year
that we couldn't do last season."
Gallagher said after the Cal-
Bronco game that the Bears were
"40 per cent improved over 1950."
After viewing pictures, he said his
first appraisal was incorrect.
