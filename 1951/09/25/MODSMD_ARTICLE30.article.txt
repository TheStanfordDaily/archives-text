It seems a pity after Stanford has gone to all the trouble and expense ot
obtaining the new look in football apparel, red trousers, that more people
won't watch the now true Redskins perform on Saturday afternoons. B\»,t
let's face it, the current home schedule is pooler than a student after payinj
tuition.
And what makes it poor is the absence of any attractive team to make
an appearance in the huge earthen bowl on any given Saturday. Of course
the Big Game is already sold out. And the UCI-A tilt on Oct 13 may drav,
over the fifty thousand mark, but what else is there?
Home Grid Sked Lacks Attractions
All games that now look to be promising are played on the road. Yet i»
be played away are titanics against Michigan at Ann Arbor, Washington a,
Seattle, and USC at Los Angeles.
And who do you and I get to watch at home? Why this weekend it is
San Jose State, who got pasted by USF last wek. Then Santa Clara, Wash
ington State, and Oregon State. Of course the two goodies, UCLA and Cali
fornia are intermixed.
Maybe I am just spoiled after seeing Michigan and Army out here in
successive years. Oh well, it may be a case of the present non-gloss gamt.
developing into shining spectacles as the season moves along.
It should be made clear however, that the fault of poor scheduling does
not lie with the Athletic Department. The schedule is drawn up by tin-
Pacific Coast Conference. It is then up to the local department to fill in the
open weeks as best they can, naturally getting good intersectionals if possible.
Things should be looking up because on the subject of scheduling, Chuck
Taylor is as ambitious as a beaver in a woodpile. Taylor recently has made
a request to Athletic Director A 1 Masters to schedule tough intersection,
contests. Nothing easy for our boy Chuck. He wants such as SMU, Okla
hotna, Ohio State, and other big time football schools.
The red head isn't shaking in his boots with the thought of losing those
big ones and then being scolded by the Alumni. Chuck explained, "Sup
pose you play a couple of easy warm ups. It's almost impossible to get your
players up for those soft games. So you end up winning the two games l>\
a fair margin but look only so-so doing it. What happens? Everybody moans
about how lousy you looked even if you do win."'
He added, I d rather get beaten by a good club and make a good showing
than trim a mediocre outfit. I subscribe to the theory that you're not going
to beat the best if you don't play them." Such talk sounds good to me.
Hard to Believe USF Hons Loaded
No doubt you have heard the talk of just how good the USF Dons are
again this year, and what a nasty shame it is they were frozen off con
ference schedules, because this year they have it for sure. It is all a littl
hard for me to swallow.
In 1940, 1946, and 1950 it was the same thing. Watch USF was the going
phrase, Stanford murdered them on all three occasions when the two met
in those years. Our Berkeley neighbors have done the same thing when they
have battled with the Dons. To me the boast of Don followers that 1951 is
the year is just another wolf-wolf cry.
Granted that Matson, Scudero, Brown. Toler, and Crew are good, and
granted that USF is a top independent, but why their insatiable desire t ( ,
step out oi their class and be humiliated time after time by bigger uuv»
ought to be better conference foes?
Enough said.
