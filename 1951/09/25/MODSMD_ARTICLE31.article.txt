# Cal Gridders Look Good; San Jose State Not So Hot
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
The question most Stanfordites
who saw the California-Santa Clara
game are asking is, "Is Cal really
that good or is Santa Clara that
bad?" And most observers seem to
feel that the answer lies somewhere
in the middle.
They think that the Broncos cer
tainly weren't as inept as the 34 to 0
score indicates. Three times, Coach
Dick Gallagher's underlings got
within breathing distance of the
Bear goal, but they never could
generate quite enough to score.
Johnny Pasco, Bronc quarter
back, proved the Bear pass defense
was vulnerable, and at times full
back Joe McCarger ripped the
vaunted Cal line to shreds. Al
though the Bears were held score
less in the first quarter, their limit
less legions began to wear Santa
Clara down and by virtue of the
breaks and sheer skill they won in
a breeze.
Cal Not the Same as in '50
Contrary to pre-season writeups,
California is not the same team
they were last season, many of the
sportswriters opined. Their line is
stronger than it was at this time
last year, but not their backfield.
Their pass defense was ineffective
and their running attack missed
Monachino and Schabarum. Powell
and West appeared to be running as
strong as Monachino and Schaba
rum did, but their blocking left
something to be desired.
]Les Richter and Johnny Olzsew

ski lived up to their press clippings,
and were the real difference be
tween the two teams.
Pappy Waldorf, attired in size 5f
brown slacks, a green shirt, and s,
red and yellow "lucky" tie that ,
hung loosely from his neck (he's*
worn it at every game since the
middle of '47), walked around the
| dressing room after the game, shak-
I ing every player's hand.
Waldorf shifted a cigar around in
I his mouth as he told reporters in
deep bass that "they had a stub- \
i born defense. They stopped John
ny Olzsewski down the middle. De
fensively, we're not sustaining our
blocks ; nd our passer needs more
protection."
Waldorf Hides Glee
Pappy had been trying to con
ceal his joy, and then he made the
understatement of the week by re
marking, "Well. I think a lot of
our kids had a lot of fun today.
"We didn't have as many long
gainers today as we did last year.
That's because we had Monachino
i and Schabarum's blocking last year
However, 1 think Richter looked a
lot better at middle linebacker than ,v
j at end linebacker where he played
j last year."
In the Santa Clara dressing room, 1
Gallagher gave Cal full credit, and
also moaned about a freak penalty
the officials called. One of the pho
tographers shouted something un
nice to one of the refs, and the
ref. thinking it was a Santa Clara
; player, fined the Broncs 15 yards.
Gallagher put up a strenuous
prote t. declaring that his players ,
were innocent. The officials didn't |
:i.-.ten to him, so he turned to the J
| whole squadron of photogs and in a
sweeping gesture ordered them to
begone.
Sail Jose State Shows Little
Stanford's next opponent, San
; Jo.-e State, gave forth a putrid per
formance against USF last Friday
night. The Spartans made only one
first down. USF, however, played
their first string for most of the
'(amp, and many accused Coach Joe
Kuharich of "pouring it on."
