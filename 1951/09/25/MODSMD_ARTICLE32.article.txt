CALIFORNIA BLANKS SANTA CLARA-Johnny Olszewski, Bear All-American candidate,
booms for yardage against the undermanned Broncos Saturday. John O. is being brought
down by John Daly (right) and Joe McCarger. Cal gave every indication of being oh its way
to another great year by whitewashing Santa Clara 34 to 0.


WASHINGTON WALTZES TO WIN —Paced by the plunging drive of fullback Hugh McElhenny
the Washington Huskies whipped weak Montana 58 to 7 at Seattle Saturday. Above, McElhenny
scores through the center of the line for the Huskies third score. Even without Don Heinrich,
out with a shoulder injury, Washington is one favorite to cop the Coast Conference.


UCLA DUMPED BY TEXAS A & M—Paul Cameron, (34) hard
running Bruin back, goes for eight yards before being stopped
by Texas Aggie linebacker, Charles McDonald. The Texans
edged the Bruins 21 to 14 in the Los Angeles Colosseum Friday
night.
