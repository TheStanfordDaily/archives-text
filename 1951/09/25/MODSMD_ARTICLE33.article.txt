## 
### DON WEBSTER 
While the Stanford varsity was j
having trouble putting away Ore
gon. Saturday, the Braves were ha/- j
ing little or none with a Hamil jn
Field team, as they eoaste i to .heir
initial victory, 40-(i, in almost de
serted Stanlyrd Stadium.
1 ue visitors, big and experienced
hy way of two previous contests,
were supposed to give the junior
varsity-freshman squad a run for
their money, but costly fumbles
combined with a strong defensive
team stopped the losers completely. ;
Hamilton's only score came in the
final quarter when there was no
question about who was to be the j
winning team, the Braves leading !
.54-0. A 12-yard bootleg play and
three line plunges scored for the
luckless visitors, halfback Jerry
Williams going over.
A Brave victory seemed likelv

from the first few minutes of play.
Hamilton Field received the open
ing kiekoff, and in the first seven
plays they fumbled twice, lost a to
tal ol seven yards, and passed tine
times, twice incomplete and once
intercepted.
Once Stanford had intreepted, it
took only ten plays to march (M
yards to a score. A pass from quar
terback Jack Bickel to halfback Bill
Scheidecker l'rom the 20 turned the
trick.
It was Stanford's only score in
the first quarter, which was not 100
bad considering that they took pos
session of the ball only one other
time during the initial frame. In
the .second quarter they had the ball

four time.;, and scored thrice for 20
more big points. Two passes, one
liom Bickel to end Doug Pinto and
the other to Bill Rogers, and a
freak play by lineman Dave Worley
did the scoring.
Worley's moment oi glory came
near the* end of the half, with Ham
, iIU 'i Field on their own 27. The
pJ ,y was probably going to be a
crap play, but Worley was too
I i't. lie charged in, and when
quarterback John Heitkamp of the
vi »tors reached out to hand off the
football, Worley borrowed it from
112 him, racing 20 yards to the seven.
Back Jarvis Watson scored on three
iiiiL' smashes.

While the Stanford varsity was j
having trouble putting away Ore
gon. Saturday, the Braves were ha/- j
ing little or none with a Hamil jn
Field team, as they eoaste i to .heir
initial victory, 40-(i, in almost de
serted Stanlyrd Stadium.
1 ue visitors, big and experienced
hy way of two previous contests,
were supposed to give the junior
varsity-freshman squad a run for
their money, but costly fumbles
combined with a strong defensive
team stopped the losers completely. ;
Hamilton's only score came in the
final quarter when there was no
question about who was to be the j
winning team, the Braves leading !
.54-0. A 12-yard bootleg play and
three line plunges scored for the
luckless visitors, halfback Jerry
Williams going over.

plays they fumbled twice, lost a to
tal ol seven yards, and passed tine
times, twice incomplete and once
intercepted.
Once Stanford had intreepted, it
took only ten plays to march (M
yards to a score. A pass from quar
terback Jack Bickel to halfback Bill
Scheidecker l'rom the 20 turned the
trick.
