# Taylor Plans Scrimmages
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor put his "perfect- j
recard" grid charges through a long '
workout yesterday with little con- j
tact wcrk, but concentrating heav
ily on parsing and offensive back
ficld blocking.
Yesterdaj' morning the coaching j
staff busied it;eli reviewing Oregon
game movies and locating the |
causes of the numerous penalties I
and the six fumbles which almost
resulted in a gift win for Oregon.
Commenting on la t Saturday's
game in Oregon where the Indians
nearly got tangled in the webbed
feet of the Oregon Ducks, Taylor
tabbed linebacker led Tanner as
The Man Who Made the Tackles, 1
and guard Norm Manoogian as
outstanding.
Welcomed back into the fold in |
yesterday's drills were fullback Bob
IVluthias. half Bob Bryan, center Al '
Robertson, center Don Tobin, and !
fullback Wu, Laubscher. Robert- i
son, who dislocated his shoulder a
few weeks ago, did little contact j
work, but was suited up and run- 1
ning.
Mathias, it was noted, was slow j
in starting from his post, due more j
to his unvureness of his duties than
lack ol speed (who says Bob Ma
thias is slow?).
Timing drills and anti - fumble !
drills will keynote the remaining
workouts this week with heavy
scrimmages slated for today and to
morrow in preparation for Satin*- 1
day's battle with San Jose State's
Spartans in the local stadium. The
Spartans, it may be remembered,
were minced by USF last weekend,
but will as usual be high for the !
Card game.
At present count, the only Indian |
who will likely be missing for the j
San Jose State game will be end
John Steinberg, up from last year's |
frosh. Steinberg hurt his knee last
week after he was named on the |
Oregon traveling squad, and it is '
feared he will be out for at least
two weeks.
