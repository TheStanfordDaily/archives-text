# Campus Skyline Changed by Building Projects
## Eating Clubs, Lab Added 
### 
Three new facilities will be
ready v/hen Stanford opens the
new academic year this week.
The changes on the campus
skyline as students arrived to
day for registration were:
An c lee Ironies laboratory, for ap
plied research, with a wing which
will he used for student electrical
engineering activities.
A long - awaited eating club
building, which will provide a home
for seven organizations which for
four decodes have provided a tra
ditional balance between Stanford's
fraternity and non-fraternity men.
Still another major construction
project, transformation of Sequoia
Hall .historic but abandoned resi
de Mice hall, into a one-story Applied
Mathematics and Statistics Labora
tory, is well under way and is ex
pected to be completed by mid-No
vember.
Two new wings which will more
than double the capacity of Croth
ers Hill, law students' residence
unit.
Research workers are already
moving into (tie new applied elcc
tion:e; laboratory, which will have
a win ~ for student electrical cmji- I
neering activities. The building, lo
cated hack of Sequoia Hall and be
side the Microwave Laboratory, will I
provide roughly 20,, r >oo square feet I
of si ;ace and will represent a more j
than $230,000 outlay.
The applied electronics building ]
will house live large rooms for re- |
search; offices; a tube shop, includ- I
ing equipment for glass work such j
as hy. rogen furnaces, and an as
sembly area; a machine shop; chcm- I
ical plating room; and stock room, j
There will also be a student tube
shop for instruction in tube con- j
struct ion.
The student, wing, made possible !
through a gift from thn Hewlett- j
.Packard Company of Palo Alto,
electronic, equipment manufactur
ing liim headed by two Stanford
graduate:;, William Hewlett and
David Packard, will include a li
brary, office space, a classroom
seating 90. an instruction labora- '
tory, a "bridge room" (scientific
term for a room equipped to carry
out electronic measurements), a
student machine shop and work
room, and an instrument repair
room.
The eating club building, north of
Toyon Hall and across the street

from Encina, is the $183,000 answer
to a five-year dream—adequate fa
cilities for clubs which have been a
part of Stanford life since 1012.
They were threatened with extinc
tion after their old, ramshackle j
building was raised during the war ;
for health reasons, and had difTi- I
culty maintaining their member. l hip j
while eating in one big room of En
cina Commons.
Each club will now have a scpa- j
rate dining room, and kitchen and j
cook's quarters in the L-shaped I
building. They will all share a joint '
lounge and entertainment room, j
The club dining rooms face out j
onto a covered arcade adjoining a
court which soon will be landscaped I

into lawn and pavement. Seven oak
I trees, salvaged from the site, will
J be replanted as part of the land
| scaping.
Transformation of Sequoia Hall
: from a three-story building into the
j Applied Mathematics and Statistics
' Laboratory will bring new life into
a historic building, which was aban
■ doncd as unsafe in 1!)4.j and since
has been used for storage purposes.
Sequoia, built in 1891 to house
| women students, and changed into a
J men's residence -unit in 1018 when
| Roble Hall was built, will offer
j 13,000 square feet of office and lab
. oratory space when it, is completed,
j Estimated cost of the reconstruction
I is $143,000.


NEW SKYLlNE—Pictured above is historic Sequoia Hall, which
is in the process of being transformed into a one-story Applied
Mathematics and Statistics Laboratory. Already completed is
a new electronics laboratory, for applied research, with room
for student electrical engineering activities (top right). The new
Eating Club building, begun last Spring with separate dining
rooms, kitchens, and cooks' quarters for each of the seven clubs,
was also completed this quarter (lower right).
