Ground has been broken for an alumni building at Stanford, it

The building, expected to be completed by April, will provide
meeting and lounge facilities and will house the Alumni Asso
ciation administrative offices.
The low, rectangular stucco structure topped by a gable roof of

red tile, will be located on the south
side of Santa Teresa Street. It will I
be adjacent to the site of proposed
new student union facilities and is in
the block between the postoftice and j
Roble Hall and opposite the firehouse. '
Funds were provided for the
alumni house by the late Guy C. Bow
man, Stanford '02, and Mrs. Bowman
of Reno, Nevada, and other alumni,
according to Dudley Swim of Carmel,
president of the Alumni Association.
Clark & Beuttler, San Francisco

club-like lounge room which, com
bined with a committee meeting room j
that may be screened off, measures
19x65 feet. One long wall of the
lounge, opening to the south, will be
entirely glass. The roof extends 12 ;
feet over this wall, providing sun pro- ;
tection and a covered loggia. Doors j
will open from the lounge to the
loggia and the patio, which extends j
toward a line of mature live oaks
along the southern edge of the level
tract. There will be a fireplace in
the lounge.
