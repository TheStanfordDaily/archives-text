TOKYO. Wednesday, Sept. 26 (UP) |
â€”American pilots destroyed or dam
aged 10 Russian Mips Tuesday in the
longest jet dogfight of the war, and
UN ground troops matched the air
victory by capturing a towering peak
west of "heartbreak hill."
In a swirling battle of the sub
stratosphere, fought by 117 planes as
high as 35,000 feet over "Mig Alley," j
U.S. pilots, with 37 F-86 Saberjets,
took the measure of 80 Russian-built
Mig jets.
