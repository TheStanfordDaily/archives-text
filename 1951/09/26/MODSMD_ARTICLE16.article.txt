# Excom Slates Committee Appointments
## 
### 
Appointments to committees and
boards will be the main business of
Exeom's first meeting of the year
tonight at 7:30.
Along with the routine business
of a first meeting, Wayne Alley,
ASSU president, said Excom will
also take up two propositions. One,
from the student manager, is that
the campus floating fund should be
distributed to charities, not sup
ported by campus drives, at one
time during the spring, rather than
throughout the year as it has in the
past.
The second is for Women's Coun
cil to have a paid secretary, so that
Council members would have more
time to devote to their work.
