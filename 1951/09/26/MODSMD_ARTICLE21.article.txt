TOKYO, Wednesday, Sept. 26 (UP)
â€” The Communist liaison officers
who stomped angrily out of yester
day's meeting at Kacsong sent an
urgent message to the Allies today
replying to an invitation 1o meet again
this morning.
But the contents of the message
were not made public immediately
and it was not known whether the
enemy liaison officers were willing to
meet again on the United Nations'
terms.
