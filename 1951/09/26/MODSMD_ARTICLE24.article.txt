# Name File Is Ready for Use
## 
### 
Although many students felt, that
something new had been added,
few realized that they filled out one
more card than usual in their reg
books this year.
The card will go to form a public
card directory, new this year, to
be kept in Room 111 A, the regis
trar's office. Harvey Hall, registrar,
hoped that the directory would be
set up and available for use today.
Number 19 in the reg books, the
card was characterized by a hole in
the bottom, and it asked the usual
questions of name, address on cam
pus and home address, phone, ma
jor study, and so forth.
The new directory was instigated
by Alpha Phi Omega, national serv
ice fraternity.. Chapter member Bill
Sanson discussed such a directory
last year with Registrar Hall and
Dean H. Donald Winbiglcr.
The result of their discussions
was the new card and a directory
which will be available to the pub
lic before the official University Di
rectory comes out in Novqmber.
Hall hopes that some way,will be
found to keep Room 111 A opeii late
for the first few weeks of the quar
ter so the directory will be acces
sible during the evenings.
Until some plan can be arranged,
however, the registrar said that the
directory will only be available
from 8 to 5 on weekdays and from
8 to noon on Saturdays.
