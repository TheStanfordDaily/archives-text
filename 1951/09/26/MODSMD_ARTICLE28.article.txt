# Second Day Swells Registration to 7,084
## 
### 
2,362 second day registrants swelled the total to 7,084 yesterday and Registrar Harvey Hall said
he thought late registrants "would easily bring the total to 7,300 or more." This was the estimate
Hall made before registration.
This fall's two-day total is 259 less than last year's when total registration reached 7,343. The
ratio after two days remained close to the estimated 2.65:1, as 5,109 men and 1,975 women filled

out books.
Commenting on procedure, Hall
said, "things went very smoothly.
There were hardly any lines after 11
this (yesterday) morning."
Registrations after yesterday will
be subject to fine as follows: $2 today
or tomorrow; $5 after tomorrow until
the end of the week; $10 thereafter.
Fees for late filing of study list
cards will bo $2 if filed this week;
$10 if over a week late. A fee of $4
is charged for each course taken up
or dropped if petition is not presented
until after the close of the quarter.
