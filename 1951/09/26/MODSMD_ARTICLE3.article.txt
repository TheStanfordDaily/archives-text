# Atomic Progress

### 
WASHINGTONâ€”Secretary of De
fense Robert A. Lovitt said today
the Joint Chiefs of Staff are already
carrying out a long-range atomic
arms program similar to that advo
cated by Sen. Bricn McMahon, D.,
Conn.
His statement appeared to herald
the coming of a new era in warfare.
But he was careful to emphasize
that there is as yet no quick, cheap,
easy way to national security.
But he added that there is
"enough truth" in stories about new
weapons and reports on atomic
progress to "encourage a very op
timistic outlook."
