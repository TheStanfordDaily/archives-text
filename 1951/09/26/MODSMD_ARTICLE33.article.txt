# Excom and 'Little Tin Gods'
## 
### 
Excom meets tonight. Once again the main
spring of Stanford student government starts
operation. To the new students, Excom stands
for Executive Committee of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University. Roughly, Excom
is to Stanford what Congress is to the United
States.
What does Excom do? Excom is the policy
board of Stanford University students. It is a
sounding board for student opinion. It acts
much like an executive board of a corporation
in handling ASSU business.
Once in awhile a hot issue lands squarely
before Excom. Last year it was the Rome Con
gress. For weeks Excom battled, trying to de
cide whether or not to okay a delegate to a
World Federation Conference in Rome. Before
the issue came to an antic-climactic end (the
delegate couldn't get a passport!) everyone had
an opportunity to sound off, and most did so.
But much more time is spent on less spec
tacular problems. In fact, as a meeting drags
on into the late hours of the night, bogged
down over a small appropriation, student
government can look discouraging to the
participants. Excom members must also
•spend long hours working on committees, a
thankless job.
It is obvious that Excom serves an important
function. It is equally obvious that Excom mem
bers, if they are doing a good job, must spend

a lot of time on routine work.
All of which leads to a third point. What
about the Excom members themselves? They
are elected representatives of various student
groups, such as residences and classes. They
must get votes to win. Most successful candi
dates must stage interesting campaigns to get
votes. In short, Excom members are campus
politicians.
Campus politicians? What a beating this
phrase has taken! If a student appears too in
terested in some campus project, if he works
his bloody head off promoting a really suc
cessful dance, he's immediately tagged by
many students as a "campus politiciana
"little tin god."
Maybe. There is no doubt that swellheads
have been on Excom and elsewhere before.
But after a year of watching Excom at work, we
feel the "little tin god" tag is overdone. Im
portant work is done by Excom members and
other leaders, work which would be left undone
if somebody didn't go after it.
All this doesn't mean there is no such thing
as a "little tin god." Maybe this years' Excom
will produce such a campus freak. But before
jumping on the name-calling bandwagon, stu
dents should at least look closely at the real
job Excom must do, and judge from their rep
resentative's actions whether or not he de
serves catcalls or encouragement.

much like an executive board of a corporation
in handling ASSU business.
Once in awhile a hot issue lands squarely
before Excom. Last year it was the Rome Con
gress. For weeks Excom battled, trying to de
cide whether or not to okay a delegate to a
World Federation Conference in Rome. Before
the issue came to an antic-climactic end (the
delegate couldn't get a passport!) everyone had
an opportunity to sound off, and most did so.
But much more time is spent on less spec
tacular problems. In fact, as a meeting drags
on into the late hours of the night, bogged
down over a small appropriation, student
government can look discouraging to the
participants. Excom members must also
•spend long hours working on committees, a
thankless job.
It is obvious that Excom serves an important
function. It is equally obvious that Excom mem
bers, if they are doing a good job, must spend

a lot of time on routine work.
All of which leads to a third point. What
about the Excom members themselves? They
are elected representatives of various student
groups, such as residences and classes. They
must get votes to win. Most successful candi
dates must stage interesting campaigns to get
votes. In short, Excom members are campus
politicians.
Campus politicians? What a beating this
phrase has taken! If a student appears too in
terested in some campus project, if he works
his bloody head off promoting a really suc
cessful dance, he's immediately tagged by
many students as a "campus politiciana
"little tin god."
Maybe. There is no doubt that swellheads
have been on Excom and elsewhere before.
But after a year of watching Excom at work, we
feel the "little tin god" tag is overdone. Im
portant work is done by Excom members and
other leaders, work which would be left undone
if somebody didn't go after it.
All this doesn't mean there is no such thing
as a "little tin god." Maybe this years' Excom
will produce such a campus freak. But before
jumping on the name-calling bandwagon, stu
dents should at least look closely at the real
job Excom must do, and judge from their rep
resentative's actions whether or not he de
serves catcalls or encouragement.
Excom meets tonight. Once again the main
spring of Stanford student government starts
operation. To the new students, Excom stands
for Executive Committee of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University. Roughly, Excom
is to Stanford what Congress is to the United
States.
What does Excom do? Excom is the policy
board of Stanford University students. It is a
sounding board for student opinion. It acts
much like an executive board of a corporation
in handling ASSU business.
