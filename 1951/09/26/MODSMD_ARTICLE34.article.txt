# BULL SESSION

### DICK McLEAN 
There comes a time to each young woman when a
word of advice is in order. Since you have left your
safe homes and come to the collegiate world, the time
has come. You must understand that certain things
have changed other than mother's cooking and your
own private room. You new problems and you
must recognize them.
Now men are basically the same everywhere. But
at Stanford they disguise themselves in ingenious ways
that might be confusing to a new freshman. You may
have done very well in the cozy world of high school,
cokes, and boys, but this is Stanford, this is the cruel
world, and these are Men.
The ratio guarantees to each and every coed two
and one half men. (If you arc under four feet nine,
you can qualify for that fractional man.) Under this
ratio system you will meet various Stanford males.
They may be freshmen, sophomores, iuniors or
seniors. They may strike you as being nice, brother
ly, kind or harmless. But none the less—beware!
Beware of Freshmen. They may appeal to you as
the youthful flower of Stanford manhood but they
are essentially unseasoned but in the season for being
seasoned—veterans that is.
Beware of Sophomores. If you see a fellow with a
fuzzy beard, a pair of beat blue Levis, a cynical grin,
a smooth line, he's a sophomore. Look out!
Beware of Juniors. They usually specialize in the
clean cut, quiet, serious approach. But it must be
remembered that they are sophomores plus one year,

u shave, and a pair of gray flannels.
(jo out with Seniors. They are the supreme re
finement of three years of college life. They are fine,
upstanding, understanding gentlemen. Going out
.with a senior is as safe as going out with your
brother.
Now there are danger signals, phrases that sound
innocent enough, and yet when you hear these words
a little neon light should flash on your brain with
the blinking word "Danger" written upon it.
A few of these phrases are:
1) "There's no need to rush in. You still have
twenty minutes."
2) "There's hardly anything in the punch but a
little fruit juice."
3) "Why don't you take a two-thirty just in case.
My old car isn't too dependable."
4) "Have you seen the world famous Leland Stan
ford Junior Cactus Gardens with one hundred variety
of cacti?"
5) "We'll just go out and have one cup of coffee and
then you can come right back in and study."
(») "My watch has stopped but it can't be too late."
7) "Sure, baby. I can get you on Rally Com."
These are some of the more prevalent danger
phrases. There are others but it would be wrong to
take away all the thrill of discovery. Why not keep
a list. Show your friends. Compare lists.
And when the items on your list reach a hundred,
tear it up, kid. You don't need it anymore. Not at all.
