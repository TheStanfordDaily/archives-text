WASHINGTON—Three federal tax
collectors and a Labor Department
wage-hour investigator admitted to
day accepting cash "commissions"
or handsome gifts from the Ameri
can Lithofold Corp., but none felt
it was improper.
One, James B. Olson of New
York, told Senate investigators that
it is a prevalent practice for federal
tax officials to have "outside busi
nesses" such as lining up printing
contracts for Lithofold.
That, prompted Sen. Joseph R.
'McCarthy, R., Wis., to say a scan
dal may be browing in the Internal
Revenue Bureau that "will make
Teapot Dome look like a cup of
tea."
A spokesman told reporters later
that the Internal Revenue Bureau
has strict rules forbidding its em
ployees 'to accept any "outside em
ployment" without official permis
sion in advance.
