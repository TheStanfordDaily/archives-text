"Stanford Angels"
The story of the "Angels from
Stanford" started in 1947 when a
Lagunita woman heard a mission
ary bishop in charge of scattered
Christians, many of them D.P.'s in
a district of Salzburg in Austria,
give a speech in England asking for
aid.
He said, "For the love of Christ,
give not only prayers, but also all
that you can spare—clothes, foods,
medicine, to as many as you can lo
cate, and you will do a great work
of love and charity for your fellows
suffering in my country and else
where. We promise to convey what
you send to the most needv, regard
less of church. . . . As yet, we can
return nothing, only our gratitude
and prayers."
Almost five years have passed
since Lagunita adopted the bishop's
village, St. Johann. Boxes of cloth
ing donated by the women, and
CAKE packages bought with the
money raised at the annual Fair,
have brought this message from
Europe;
"You have given us a new hope
that God will not quite forget to
have mercy on us."
Right now more help is needed
than ever before for the little vil
lage. More refugees from the East
ern Zone are coming in. The bish
op has recently died. Sister Lorre,
his assistant, cannot pay for the fu
neral or burial and not even post
age for letters asking for help since
the postage rates have recently
tripled.

"Stanford Angels"
The story of the "Angels from
Stanford" started in 1947 when a
Lagunita woman heard a mission
ary bishop in charge of scattered
Christians, many of them D.P.'s in
a district of Salzburg in Austria,
give a speech in England asking for
aid.
He said, "For the love of Christ,
give not only prayers, but also all
that you can spare—clothes, foods,
medicine, to as many as you can lo
cate, and you will do a great work
of love and charity for your fellows
suffering in my country and else
where. We promise to convey what
you send to the most needv, regard
less of church. . . . As yet, we can
return nothing, only our gratitude
and prayers."
Almost five years have passed
since Lagunita adopted the bishop's
village, St. Johann. Boxes of cloth
ing donated by the women, and
CAKE packages bought with the
money raised at the annual Fair,
have brought this message from
Europe;
"You have given us a new hope
that God will not quite forget to
have mercy on us."
Right now more help is needed
than ever before for the little vil
lage. More refugees from the East
ern Zone are coming in. The bish
op has recently died. Sister Lorre,
his assistant, cannot pay for the fu
neral or burial and not even post
age for letters asking for help since
the postage rates have recently
tripled.
"The Angels from Stanford," as
Lagunita's "adopted" Austrian vil
lage calls the Lag women, are pre
senting the annual Farm Fair Sat

buy CARE packages and to send
money to their new friends,.
The date or no-date affair will be
held in Lagunita Court from 8:30

Mundy's orchestra will take place
