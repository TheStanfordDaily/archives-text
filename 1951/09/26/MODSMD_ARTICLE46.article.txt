### BY "DIGGER" ODELL 
FOK SALE—One (1) Rose Howl tie. red, 194!) model. In almost perfect
condition, never been worn. Should be aged longer before wearing. Nice
gift for freshman. Will sell cheap or trade for more conservative pink tie.
This, in short, sums up what an eager but pessimistic Sport Editor thinks
of the '51 Indian grid team. It will no doubt come as a great shock to those
lew who have made their reservations in Pasadena; to those few who will
say at the drop ol a rooter's ticket, "This is our year."
Looking back over our Stanford days, we wonder just how many times
that statement has been made. If memory serves correctly, those were
the very words we were greeted with when we arrived on this campus, a
bright-eyed freshman, one sunny morning in the fall of '49. It's beginning
to look like those will be the words used at our commencement exercises.
What we are about to say will probably never penetrate the numbed
brains of returning students, most of whom have become impervious to the
thought, smell, or sight of roses; but for the benefit of the new students
who are easy prey to Itabid Kose Hooters and bar-stool coaches, we're
going to give it to you straight from the shoulder. It may hurt, but it's
better than sweating out a few hours every Saturday instead of enjoying
a football game.
The 1951 Stanlord grid team is made up of a good bunch of guys who want
to play football. Most of them are good players, some fair, and one or two
could make any team in the country. But the Indians are not going to win
every ball game; they're not going to win any championship; and they're
not going to beat anyone in the Rose Bowl because they're not going to play
in the Rose Bowl.
Instead, these boys are going out every Saturday to play a game of foot
ball. They're going to play to win, not for any gain, but for the satisfaction,
and they're going to have a lot of fun. They're going to have the assistance
and help of a top-notch coaching staff, and believe us, they'll never have
a better staff.
As far as you fans are concerned, you want to watch a good football
team and have an enjoyable time on a given Saturday afternoon. And
that s what you'll get. You'll be admitted to most games free and pay a
small sum for others. You'll go out there and sit in the warm sun and
holler your head off for "your" team. You'll cheer and scream and laugh
happily when Kerkorian. McColl. Ilugasian, and the likes play well and
loudly proclaim we wouldn't trade them for all the Olsxewskis and McEl
httnnys and Mooinaws in (he country.
And when the boys have a bad day, which is bound to lulppen, you'll
groan and cry and mumble that you'd trade the whole kit 'n' kaboodle for
Abbott and Costelly.
All in all, you'll get more than your money's worth. You'll have a won
derlul time and have enough conversation pieces to last a week.
As Kit as the biand of lootball you 11 have this season is concerned, you're
going to see a good team every Saturday afternoon. There's no squad in the
conference that Stanford can't beat, and likewise there's no team that can't
beat Stanford. The outcome will depend on who plays a better game on a
given Saturday. The Pacific Coast Conference is the most evenly matched
it has been since before the war, and Stanford won't come through un
scathed—we don't think Cal will either, if that means anything.
And after this football season is past, you'll forget all the bad moments
and remember all the exciting ones. You'll dream of Kerkorian's good
passes and McColl's' catches, and with the passing of autumn and fall quar
ter your thoughts and thrills will be transferred from football to the next
sport, basketball. You'll be ready for another sports season, and you'll
groan and cheer Tor the Card cagers like you've never groaned and
cheered before.
Woe is the life of the forgotten football player.

passes and McColl's' catches, and with the passing of autumn and fall quar
ter your thoughts and thrills will be transferred from football to the next
sport, basketball. You'll be ready for another sports season, and you'll
groan and cheer Tor the Card cagers like you've never groaned and

Woe is the life of the forgotten football player.
FOK SALE—One (1) Rose Howl tie. red, 194!) model. In almost perfect
condition, never been worn. Should be aged longer before wearing. Nice
gift for freshman. Will sell cheap or trade for more conservative pink tie.
This, in short, sums up what an eager but pessimistic Sport Editor thinks
of the '51 Indian grid team. It will no doubt come as a great shock to those
lew who have made their reservations in Pasadena; to those few who will
say at the drop ol a rooter's ticket, "This is our year."
Looking back over our Stanford days, we wonder just how many times
that statement has been made. If memory serves correctly, those were
the very words we were greeted with when we arrived on this campus, a
bright-eyed freshman, one sunny morning in the fall of '49. It's beginning
to look like those will be the words used at our commencement exercises.
What we are about to say will probably never penetrate the numbed
brains of returning students, most of whom have become impervious to the
thought, smell, or sight of roses; but for the benefit of the new students
who are easy prey to Itabid Kose Hooters and bar-stool coaches, we're
going to give it to you straight from the shoulder. It may hurt, but it's
better than sweating out a few hours every Saturday instead of enjoying
a football game.
The 1951 Stanlord grid team is made up of a good bunch of guys who want
to play football. Most of them are good players, some fair, and one or two
could make any team in the country. But the Indians are not going to win
every ball game; they're not going to win any championship; and they're
not going to beat anyone in the Rose Bowl because they're not going to play
in the Rose Bowl.
Instead, these boys are going out every Saturday to play a game of foot
ball. They're going to play to win, not for any gain, but for the satisfaction,
and they're going to have a lot of fun. They're going to have the assistance
and help of a top-notch coaching staff, and believe us, they'll never have
a better staff.
As far as you fans are concerned, you want to watch a good football
team and have an enjoyable time on a given Saturday afternoon. And
that s what you'll get. You'll be admitted to most games free and pay a
small sum for others. You'll go out there and sit in the warm sun and
holler your head off for "your" team. You'll cheer and scream and laugh
happily when Kerkorian. McColl. Ilugasian, and the likes play well and
loudly proclaim we wouldn't trade them for all the Olsxewskis and McEl
httnnys and Mooinaws in (he country.
And when the boys have a bad day, which is bound to lulppen, you'll
groan and cry and mumble that you'd trade the whole kit 'n' kaboodle for
Abbott and Costelly.
All in all, you'll get more than your money's worth. You'll have a won
derlul time and have enough conversation pieces to last a week.
As Kit as the biand of lootball you 11 have this season is concerned, you're
going to see a good team every Saturday afternoon. There's no squad in the
conference that Stanford can't beat, and likewise there's no team that can't
beat Stanford. The outcome will depend on who plays a better game on a
given Saturday. The Pacific Coast Conference is the most evenly matched
it has been since before the war, and Stanford won't come through un
scathed—we don't think Cal will either, if that means anything.
And after this football season is past, you'll forget all the bad moments
and remember all the exciting ones. You'll dream of Kerkorian's good
passes and McColl's' catches, and with the passing of autumn and fall quar
ter your thoughts and thrills will be transferred from football to the next
sport, basketball. You'll be ready for another sports season, and you'll
groan and cheer Tor the Card cagers like you've never groaned and
