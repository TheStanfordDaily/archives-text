with injuries after showing signs of
greatness in the 1949 Big Game.
All in all the squad looked better
as a unit. Blocking was sharper and
timing seemed to be up to par. It
was also noted with favorable in

ble, an old Stanford nemesis.
The first-string offensive unit ran
their plays against the first defen

while down at the other end of the
practice field the varsity defensive
unit was stopping San Jose State
plays run off by the Brave offensive
squad.
