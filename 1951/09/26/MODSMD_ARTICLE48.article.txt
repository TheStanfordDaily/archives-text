OVER HE GOESâ€”Wes Laubscher smashes over for the Cards' fourth TD against San Jose State
in last year's game as tackle Jim Wheelehan vainly tries to stop him. Halfback Gibby Mendonsa
(No. 22) is too late to get in on the play. Laubscher, out of the Oregon game due to injuries, will
try to duplicate his feat against the Spartans Saturday.
