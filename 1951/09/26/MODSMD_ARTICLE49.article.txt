# Cards Prepare for San Jose Contest
## Meyers, Mathias And Crist Compete For Fullback Post 
### 
It was work day on the Farm
yesterday as Chuck Taylor ran
his boys through a 90 - minute
scrimmage in preparation for
Saturday's tussle with the San
Jose State Spartans.
The fullback post appeared par
ticularly outstanding during the af
ternoon with Bob Meyers, Bob Mu
thias, and Skip Crist alternating.
All three were finding holes in the
defensive set-up and showed both
power and speed. Mathras, although
favoring a sore leg, appeared more
sure ol himself as he powered his
way through the line.
Earlier in the afternoon during
blocking practice both Meyers and
Mathias showed that they knew
their lessons, and Taylor seemed
pleased with their efforts.
When it came to speed in the
scrum, though, it was all halfback
Eric Southwood, a 6 - foot, 183-
pounder from Los Angeles. South-
