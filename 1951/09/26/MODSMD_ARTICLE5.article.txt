WASHINGTON — Czech Ambas
sador Vladimir Prochazka hinted
today that his country might bar
gain for release of American news
man William N. Oatis—if the Unit
ed States will lift restrictions on
Czech trade.
His guarded statements, at an ex
traordinary two-hour press confer
ence in the Czech embassy, were
the first indication the Communist
government in Prague might be
ready to "talk terms" for freeing
Oatis. The Associated Press corre
spondent was sentenced on July 4
to 10 years' imprisonment after he
"confessed" to spy charges.
