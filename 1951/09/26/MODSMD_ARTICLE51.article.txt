## Giants Drop Philadephia 5-1; Dodger Lead Cut as Braves Win 
### 
NEW YORK. Sep). 25 (UP)â€”The
fantastic New York Giants turned
the National League pennant race
into what could become the mad
dest finish yet when they crept to
within a game of the panic-stricken j
Dodgers tonight, beating the Phil- j
lies, 5 to 1, while Brooklyn was
trampled twice by Boston, 6 to 3 j
and 14 to 2.
At the same time, the Yankees
came to within two contests of
clinching their third straight flag
when collapsible Cleveland suffered
its fourth straight defeat. 4 to 2,
to the White Sox in Chicago. The j
third - place Red Sox also were j
beaten, to 0, in Washington.
The Giants, "shooting the works," i
acquired a 3 to 0 lead off Philly !
ace Robin Roberts.
Jim Hearn, the Giants' special
Philly-killer, pitched scoreless five

hit ball for six innings but when
Willie Jones hit a homer to lead !
off the seventh and Eddie Waitkus
and Del Wilber singled, Durocher
brought in the great Sal Maglie.
Maglie induced Del Ennis to hit
an inning-ending double play and i
cut the Phillies off the rest of the
, way as Hearn gained credit for his j
16th decision.
