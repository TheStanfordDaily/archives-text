| the throne, postponed the start of
i the tour "a week or two" past the
i scheduled Oct. 2 arrival in Quebec.
While the announcement said the
new tour date of Canada will be
i announced as soon as known, it
j added only that the Princess and
j Prince "hope very much" that they
J could still visit Washington.
It was believed the scheduled
: royal visit to President Truman
may have to be called of! alto

i to visit Washingto non Oct. 24 and
j 25 after the western part of their
Canadian tour.
The developments of the day
were not encouraging.
The morning bulletin said:
"The King has had a less restful
j night, but His Majesty's general
{ condition this morning is good and
I progress is maintained."
