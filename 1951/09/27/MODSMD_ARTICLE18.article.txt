WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 (UP) —
Britain and the United States con
ferred urgently today over possible
last-minute steps to avoid an armed
clash in Iran that might lead to an
attempted Communist coup in that
oil-rich country.

He made the statement after a
long conference with British Am- ]
bassador Sir Oliver Franks, Presi
dential Assistant W. Averell Harri
man, and other top U.S. diplomatic j
officials.
A dispatch from London said that
Prime Minister Clement R. Attlee
was appealing to Acheson and Pres
ident Truman, through Franks, to
use their good offices to find a way j
out of the crisis. A similar plea
was reported to have been made by
Iran.
Informants said Franks handed
Acheson such a communication.
Diplomatic sources said the Unit
ed States is debating its reply.
There was no word on whether a i
similar appeal from Iran has been j
received.
These sources believe Britain has
not yet made a final decision on
whether to use force to keep Brit
ish workers at the Abadan oil re
finery, despite Iran's ultimatum that
they get out by Oct. 4. Britain has
ships, planes, soldiers, and para
chute troops within easy reach of
Abadan, the world's largest oil re
finery.
