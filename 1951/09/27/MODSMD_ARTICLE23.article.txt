# Lozabnick Is Named Soph Class President
## Excom Approves Council Worker 
### 
I
Don Lozabnick was appointed
Sophomore Class President by
Excom last night when the post j
was declared vacant by the res
ignation of Dick Shooshan.

Shooshan was elected '54 class !
president last year but resigned for j
scholastic reasons. Lozabnick was !
the runner-up in the sophomore J
presidential election last spring and !
will hold office until the next reg
ular election this fall when the
freshmen will elect their represen
tative on Excom.
Excom unanimously voted their
approval for Women's Council to hire
a paid secretary out of their key fund
after pro's and con's to the proposal
were presented by Joan Symon, pres
ident of Women's Council, and stu
dent manager George Denny.
Not Enough Time
Joan Symon pointed out that Coun
cil members did not have sufficient
time to carry out their elected duties
—that of educating the students on
social regulations, the fundamental
standard, and, with Men's Council,
the Honor Cods—because of the de
tailed office work entailed in keeping
accurate records of all women stu
dents.
She and other members of Council
proposed that a secretary, preferably
an ex-Stanford student familiar with
the philosophy of women's regula
tions, be hired for one hour five times
a week at $1.25 per hour. This pro
posal, to work on a trial basis for one
year, was finally accepted.
Denny suggested that an improved
system might be worked out within
the five members of Women's Coun
cil, rather than resorting to a paid,
outside worker.
Appointments
Excom also approved the following
i appointments by Wayne Alley, ASSU
I president: Drives Committee, Mari-
I anne Buttner; SAC representative,
Chuck Silverbcrg; Constitution Com
| mittee, Joan Hamann, and Steve
Blumberg; Committee of Minutes,
Colleen Daveney and Bill Funden
j berg.
Colleen Daveney, Barry Jackson,
and Steve Blumberg were appointed
to interview applicants for the Stu
dent Faculty Employment Commis
i sion, and Chuck Silverberg, Mari
j anne Buttner, and Ed Tucker to se
j lect the chaiiTnan of the Election
! Board.
A proposal by the student mana
ger to distribute the campus fioat
! ing fund at one time during the
spring was also approved. This
fund is usually used for charities
j not supported by regular campus
drives and in the past has been al
j lotted throughout the year.

after pro's and con's to the proposal
were presented by Joan Symon, pres
ident of Women's Council, and stu
dent manager George Denny.
Not Enough Time
Joan Symon pointed out that Coun
cil members did not have sufficient
time to carry out their elected duties
—that of educating the students on
social regulations, the fundamental
standard, and, with Men's Council,
the Honor Cods—because of the de
tailed office work entailed in keeping
accurate records of all women stu
dents.
She and other members of Council
proposed that a secretary, preferably
an ex-Stanford student familiar with
the philosophy of women's regula
tions, be hired for one hour five times
a week at $1.25 per hour. This pro
posal, to work on a trial basis for one
year, was finally accepted.
Denny suggested that an improved
system might be worked out within
the five members of Women's Coun
cil, rather than resorting to a paid,
outside worker.
Appointments
Excom also approved the following
i appointments by Wayne Alley, ASSU
I president: Drives Committee, Mari-
I anne Buttner; SAC representative,
Chuck Silverbcrg; Constitution Com
| mittee, Joan Hamann, and Steve
Blumberg; Committee of Minutes,
Colleen Daveney and Bill Funden
j berg.
Colleen Daveney, Barry Jackson,
and Steve Blumberg were appointed
to interview applicants for the Stu
dent Faculty Employment Commis
i sion, and Chuck Silverberg, Mari
j anne Buttner, and Ed Tucker to se
j lect the chaiiTnan of the Election
! Board.
A proposal by the student mana
ger to distribute the campus fioat
! ing fund at one time during the
spring was also approved. This
fund is usually used for charities
j not supported by regular campus
drives and in the past has been al
j lotted throughout the year.
