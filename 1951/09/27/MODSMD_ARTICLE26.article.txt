# USC Humor Magazine Indefinitely Suspended
## 
### 
Another college humor magazine was struck down last week
when the Publications Board of the University of Southern Cali
fornia ordered publication of Wampus suspended.
The 32-year-old fun-magazine folded as the University withheld
its annual subsidy, and Wampus editors found themselves with
out cash reserves.
Wampus had been on insecure financial footing for the past

j several years as advertising has con
j tinued to slack off. Since last year
Wampus had been dependent on the
j university grant.
The board took action upon the re
quest of Wampus Editor Jim Lasry
who said that he saw no way for the
! magazine to make money.
The suspension is for an "indefinite
period," but Lasry admited that only
"a miracle can save Wampus."
Last year Wampus was the center
of a campus feud as many USC stu
dents claimed that the magazine was
"off-color." Despite the complaint of
some students, no university action
resulted. The withholding of the sub
i sidy this year was attributed to an
1 economy move on the part of univer
| sity trustees.

j Brennan, editor of the Chaparral,

other than financial), extended his
