# Italy 'Unshackled'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The United
Stales, Britain, and France agreed
today to scrap peace treaty provi
sions which prevent Italy from re
arming and are stifling its economic
development.
Ignoring certain Russian protests,
the three nations said it is time to
re-write the 1947 pact and clear the
way for Italy to become "an active
and equal member of the demo
cratic and freedom-loving family of
nations."
A joint declaration, released si
multaneously here and in London
and Paris, said the Big Three are
ready to 'give favorable considera
iion" to Italy's request that the
treaty's "shackles" be removed.
