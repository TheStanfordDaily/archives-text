# Give 'Em a Lift
## 
### 
Stanford is a university of many traditipns—
and we think that one of the best is that of giv
ing rides to students standing at cither end of
Palm Drive, waiting for a bus.
Wondering if a bus will come by soon is no
fun, especially if you have only an hour be
tween classes to get into Paly or have to get
back to campus in time for dinner. And it's
pretty easy for a driver passing by to stop for
a couple of seconds and ask a student if he'd
like a ride in. It's the friendly thing to do—
and something that anyone without a car v/ill
always appreciate.
You'll see students waiting in a number of

places. Traditionally, for rides into Paly or
the Village, they are in front of the oak tree
by Mem Aud, the Bookstore, and the campus
end of Palm Drive; for rides back to Stanford,
students usually wait in front of the old Wil
son's restaurant by the first stoplight on Uni
versity Avenue, at the Palm Drive entrance, or
at the Village entrances.
Let's not allow the old rides tradition to pass
into disuse. It won't take more than a few
seconds of your time to stop and ask a student
if he'd like a ride. And giving him a lift will
be greatly appreciated.— H. K.
