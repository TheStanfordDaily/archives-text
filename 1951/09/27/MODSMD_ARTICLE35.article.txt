# BULL SESSION

### DICK McLEAN 
WHAT EVERY FRESHMAN MAN SHOULD KNOW
If you're a new freshman at Encina or Toyon, you've
got a good deal in store for you. It seems that fresh
men at every college follow a familiar cycle. You'll
all learn a lot in common and share some costly and
some valuable experiences. But you'll live nine
months so full of fun and work and worry and ex
citement that you won't even remember what high
school was like. In short, you'll discover what is called
The Great Freshman Experience.
You'll be scared of college for about two weeks but
after that you'll catch on to what it's all about. You'll
call your sponsors "sir" for about that long and then
start pouring flaming lighter fluid under his door.
All in the spirit of fun, of course.
You'll learn that living with two room mates is
tough. It takes real teamwork and consideration on
everyone's part to keep from feeling as if you'd like
to fip that top bunk a hit and launch one of them
out (he third story window.
You'll feel like a real man the first time you're
served a beer. You'll drink it with a swagger and with
gusto whether you like the stuff or not. You'll order
another quart and laugh at anyone who is slow at
getting down the first one. At the end of the second
quart even you will be believing that you're a man.
You'll try to prove it forever on the third. And at the
end of the evening the slower "boys" will cart you
up the three flights to your room because by then

you'll be sleeping like a baby.
You'll learn to wash your own T-shirts and mend
your own socks. You'll manage your own check
ing account, foul it up miserably, borrow money from
a buddy, and finally write a long letter home full
of love and explanations and asking for a slight
touch.
You'll get in all night bull sessions. You'll argue
Korea, Mac Arthur, Truman and politics in general.
You'll seek along the paths of the great religious
philosophers and put your own beliefs on the critical
scale of reason. And in the end of it all you'll be
wiser and sleepy and discussing the oldest subject since
Adam got lonely.
You'll get behind in a subject or two and try
cramming all night. You'll drink black coffee and
try to digest about three hundred dry pages. You'll
feel reckless and try "NoDoze" and find it doesn't
work. You'll marvel through your sleepy lids at the
daily miracle called dawn and wonder what you've
been missing all these mornings. You'll take the
test, pass by a slim margin, go back to Encina and
bed. making the resolution not to fall behind again
as you sleep through the rest of your daily classes.
And when you're thinking instead of memorizing,
and drinking only a sane amount of beer, and keeping
the room fairly clean, and avoiding all night dis
cussions, and reminiscing about the wild times, then
you'll know â€” the Great Freshman Experience has
ended. And you're now an old. old man.
