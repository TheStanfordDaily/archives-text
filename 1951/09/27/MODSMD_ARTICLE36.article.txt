# CAMPUS OPINION
## Bulletin Boards 
### 
To the Editor:
I note in this morning's Dippy a glib report of the
apparently almost unnoticed passing of another great
Stanford Tradition. It is with the utmost chagrin that
I see no greater attention to student convenience.
The bulletin boards on History and Engineering
Corners hat-e long been a valuable part of Stanford
living. I am the first to grant that from time to time
they have become something less than beautiful—but
beauty is not their prime function.
Here was the one place where the individual could
post a notice that would be seen by others. Granted
the present scheme of going thru the already over
burdened Public Exercises Office provides for fill
ing this gap somewhat—but it does not replace the
flexibility of use. nor the availability to the student.

of the old hoards.
It is true, of course, that Daily Classified's Get Re
sults, but there is no Daily between Dead Week and
the end of Finals —how does one go about selling books,
desks, lamps, and the miriad other items of student
commerce in this period?
Finally, it appears to me that this is another blow
to the Off-Campus orphans. All living groups on the
campus have provision for bulletin boards of one kind
or another. Off-Campus students frequently in the
past have used these two boards for personal notes, etc.
No one has found a substitute for this service. No
one has asked those concerned—i.e. the student body
at large and off-campus students in particular—how
they fee! about it.
If in fact, as per today's editorial* there be no "tin
gods" in student body office, let them hear the vox
populi and act accordingly.
