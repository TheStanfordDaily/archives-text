Four Stanford Cave Clubbers ex
plored the forgotten Palmer Cave
in the heart of Sequoia National
Park earlier this month.
Descending by means of a rope
j ladder, Hal Treacy, Doug Allen. Ed
Danehy, and Art Lange investi
gated the three large chambers of
the cave.
Palmer Cave, the largest in the
state, contains many pillars and sta
lactites. In a mound of earth fallen
from above were many animal skel
i etons, including mummified deer
| and mountain lions.
Since its discovery in 1873 the
| cave has been visited only a few
| times. It has been reported that
once human remains were found.
Alter visiting Palmer Cave, the
four investigated other Sequoia
caves during succeeding days.


IN THE CHASMâ€”Traveling through groves of trees, one mem
ber of the exploring party is pictured in the ominous chasm
which forms the entrance to Palmer Cave.
