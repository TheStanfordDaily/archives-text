GETTING INTO SHAPE. Leon (Humphrey Pennyworth) King is now
just Leon King. Last year, Leon was a well-upholstered 238 pounds, and
the preacher-to-be was nicknamed Humphrey Pennyworth. Now King
has trimmed off 15 pounds and has a streamlined figure. He is much
faster and will be one of the mo.;t devastating defensive linemen in the
league.
Another member of Stanford's footfall organization went from 220
to 204 pounds. His name? Chuck Taylor. Panpy Waldorf, take note.

KICKOFF CONCERT DEPT. When San Jose State kicks off this Sat
urday, watch the ritual they go through. Halfback Archie Chagoniian
(number 23), an Armenian who's not at Stanford, makes out like Arthur
fiedler directing the Boston Pops as he directs the kickoff operation.
Chagonjian faces his teammates, who are lined up for the kickofl', and
with upraised arms he signals the ref to blow the whittle. In the key of
C, please. Then he looks searchingly at the ten other players, as if to make
sure all the violas and glockenspiels are in tune. Having seen that every
one is ready, he swings his arm down, and the team and ball are on the
yvay down the field.

ONE DOWN, TWO TO GO. Line Coach Joe Kurtz was surveying the
wreckage after a play during a recent workout: "Well, let's see. There
were five blocks made that time . . . three of them by Manoogian."

BANZAI! Compact guard Phil Wilson is the closest thing Stanford
has to a Japanese suicide pilot. On two successive kickoll's against Ore
gon. Wilson churned down the field with his eves shut tighter than
the Roble doors at 10:31 p.m.
MOST DETERMINED MAN ON SQUAD. Sophomore end John
Steinberg, an excedingly promising gridder, was on the traveling list
for the Oregon game. A few days before the game, he injured his knee
and couldn't make the trip.
He'll be out of the San Jose State contest, but he vows he'll be ready
for the Michigan) Reason? John's parents live in New Jersey, and
St will be the dnjy opportunity in'three yeavs that they will have to see
him play.

A BREAK WITH TRADITION. Stanford's gridders will be fashion
blueplates this year. The Cards broke out with new all-red uniforms
against Oregon, and word has it that all the Portland fashion editors were
•''ob 'ing and "ah"ing. The unveiling of these new raiments for home con
sumption may be delayed until the UCLA game, but they are worth wait
ing for.
Instead of the regulation white cotton pants, the Indians now have dark
led lastex and nylon bottoms. Lastex is the same material that girdles are
made from. It is conducive to bringing out girlish figures. If a gridder is
""stacked," his manly lines won't be lost under bulky pads. The new pads
are streamlined.
As one observer pionted out, the Cards will he positively racy in their
Ted devil outfits. It'll be Halloween every Saturday.
The new red knickerbockers give the Indians four choices of uni
forms—all red, all white, red pants and white shirts, or white pants with
red shirts. This means new Droblems for Chuck Taylor. Figuring out his
offensive and defensive platoons will be comparatively easy. Deciding
what haberdashery the Cards will be attired in is a toughie, though.
Every Saturday, Chuck will look over the four lovely sets of uniforms
arid say, "Dear me, what shall we wear today?"

A BREAK WITH TRADITION. Stanford's gridders will be fashion
blueplates this year. The Cards broke out with new all-red uniforms
against Oregon, and word has it that all the Portland fashion editors were
•''ob 'ing and "ah"ing. The unveiling of these new raiments for home con
sumption may be delayed until the UCLA game, but they are worth wait
ing for.
Instead of the regulation white cotton pants, the Indians now have dark
led lastex and nylon bottoms. Lastex is the same material that girdles are
made from. It is conducive to bringing out girlish figures. If a gridder is
""stacked," his manly lines won't be lost under bulky pads. The new pads
are streamlined.
As one observer pionted out, the Cards will he positively racy in their
Ted devil outfits. It'll be Halloween every Saturday.
The new red knickerbockers give the Indians four choices of uni
forms—all red, all white, red pants and white shirts, or white pants with
red shirts. This means new Droblems for Chuck Taylor. Figuring out his
offensive and defensive platoons will be comparatively easy. Deciding
what haberdashery the Cards will be attired in is a toughie, though.
Every Saturday, Chuck will look over the four lovely sets of uniforms
arid say, "Dear me, what shall we wear today?"
