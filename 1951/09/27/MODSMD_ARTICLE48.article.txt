# Joseans Shift Lineup As Indians Scrimmage
## 
### 
As Stanford went through its sec
ond consecutive afternoon of rough
( and tough scrimmage, San Jose
! State Coach Bob Bronzan juggled
I his lineup for this Saturday's In
| dian-Spartan battle.
Hoping to rebound from the
j crushing 39 to 2 defeat at the hands
jof USF, Bronzan named six new
j men to the offensive unit. Tackles
! Jack Adams and Sal Cardinally
{ guard Dick Bondelie, end Stan Wa
j cholz, quarterback Larry Rice, and
! fullback Bob Sykes will all start
j the Card game.
Yesterday the Golden Raiders
had heavy contact work with em-
I phasis on aggressiveness. With the
| return of the injured Lynn Apla
nalp to quarterback work, San Jose
can be expected to use some single
winged plays Saturday.

On the local scene the Indians
looked sharper running plays
against live opposition as well as
dummy bags. Gary Kerkorian and
Bob Garrett both got oft' long runs
from their quarterback spots. Ker
l korian's passing against the defen
i sive unit was reminiscent of his
throwing in the '50 Big Game.
Bob Meyers was running fast and
plunging hard at fullback. Bob Ma
thias alternating with Meyers was
i running well but still favors his leg.
But on the dismal side, Barry
j Smith, promising sophomore tackle,
will undergo an arm operation to
| day for a torn muscle and be lost
j for at least four weeks.
And out of Saturday's game will
jbe end John Steinberg with a
I bruised knee and halfback Wes
' Laubscher with an ankle injury.


JOHN STEINBERG
—Out with a bad knee


BROTHER ACT—Larry and A 1 Matthews may see heavy duty
at the halfback posts against Stanford. Both hail from Monterey
JC where they posted enviable records.
