# Peace Deadlocked
## 
### 
TOKYO. Thursday, Sept. 27â€”The
United Nations offered to send liai
son officers to Kaesong today for a
fourth meeting with Communist
liaison officers but again turned
down a Red offer to resume full
dress armistice negotiations imme
diately.
While the Communists have each
day asked that full-scale armistice
negotiations resume, the Allies are
demanding that guarantees first be
set up to avoid incidents such as the
one that led to the rupture of the
truce talks Aug. 25.
With both sides standing pat on
their original positions, a perma
nent breakdown in the truce talks
loomed.
