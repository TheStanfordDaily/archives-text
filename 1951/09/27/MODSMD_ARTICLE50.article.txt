# Braves Test Red Varsity
## 
### 
The Stanford Braves, running
| through San Jose State plays for
I the benefit of the varsity this week,
I have an off-day this Saturday be
fore colliding with Alameda Naval j
Air Station next week.
Th JV's, taking their bumps from i
the Card first-stringers, haven't had
a chance to hold a practice session j
of their own to iron out kinks found
in the Hamilton Field game. But j
Coach Bob Ghilotti described him
self as generally satisfied with the i
performance, singling out quarter- !
' back Jack Bickel especially.
In the meantime, the second j
1 Braves team, composed mostly of !
freshmen, is being grounded in fun- j
damentals, with individuals being |
i groomed to move up to the regular |
Braves when they become ready, I
and perhaps later even to the var- ]
sity.
