### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 2G (UP)â€”The
Brooklyn Dodgers brought their
dizzy skid to a halt with a resound
ing 15-5 victory over the Boston
Braves today but the New York
Yankees dropped a 4-1 decision to
the Philadelphia Athletics.
The Dodgers lead the New York
Giants by one and a half games.
Any combination of Dodger victo
ries and Giant defeats totaling three
will clinch the National League
pennant for them. The Dodgers
have four games to play while the
Giants have three, including one
with the Phillies tonight. A Giant
victory tonight will again cut
Brooklyn's lead to one game.
In the American League, the
Yankees now lead the Cleveland
Indians by only 2 games but must
win only two of their remaining
five games to clinch. The Indians
are idle tonight.

shakily to his 19th victory of the
season behind the assault. He was

alter the Dodgers had given him an
eight-run cushion.
