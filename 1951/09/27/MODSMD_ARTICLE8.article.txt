WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 (UP) â€”
[ Senate investigators were told to
day that a "Free Asia" pamphlet
J turned out by Henry A. Wallace in
| 1944 for the Institute of Pacific Re
i lations actually was written by the
; wife of Far Eastern expert Owen
; Lattimore.
Raymond Dennett, former Insti
| tute secretary, told the Senate In
! ternal Security Committee that the
j final manuscript of the pamphlet,
j "Our Job in the Pacific," was sent
J to Wallace for his approval while
| the former Vice-PreJu. Nt was on
j his 1944 survey trip to Asia.
Dennett, who protested "pro-
Russian sentiments" he found in the
I Institute research staff, also volun
; teered an endorsement of the loy
alty of Ambassador-at-Large Philip
j C. Jessup. He said, over the protests
J of committee counsel Robert Mor
j ris, that Jessup is the "one person"
he would never believe guilty of
| "any connection with Communism."
The committee is investigating the
! Institute, a private research organi
zation, as part of its inquiry into al
leged subversive influences on U.S.
Far Eastern policy.
