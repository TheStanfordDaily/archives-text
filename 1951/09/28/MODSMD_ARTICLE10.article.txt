# Farm Eleven After 2nd Win
## Indian Team to Meet San Jose State Spartans in Local Stadium Tomorrow 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's footballing Indians will go after their second win of
the young season tomorrow when they take to the warpath against
an underdog San Jose State eleven in the Stadium. Kickoff is 2:00.
Odds makers, who have a habit of being as right as rain, have
established the Cards as forty point favorites in tomorrow's battle.

j Twenty thousand onlookers are ex
pected to be on hand. The odds are
I not based on Stanford's showing
1 against Oregon but rather on the 39 j
; to 2 blasting that ths Spartans suf
fered at th!S hands of USF last week.
However tne lopsided odds might i
; be just a little too heavy on the Stan- J
ford end of the scale as San Jose's
head coach has shaken up his lineup j
in hopes of rebounding from the !
depths of defeat. Bob Bronzan is the j
coach that could work wonders.
Many consider the 32-year-old
: Spartan Mentor as one of the out- j
standing young coaches in the coun
try. Last year at Stite, Bronzan
turned out a team which won six, 1
I tied one and lost three while play- j
ing the toughest schedule in the
school's history.
Ofiensc Juggled
This week Bronzan has put his j
1 charges through rugged scrimmages |
stressing aggressiveness, not neces- j
sarily technique. Bronzan was also
concerned with bringing his squad
out of the psychological dumps. Just
: how well he succeeded will be known j
at four-thirty Saturday.
One thing for certain that came out [
of the week's work is that the Spar- |
tans will open the game with a jug
glerl offensive unit, which will in
clude five new faces. Quarterback
' Lynn Aplanalp who missed the Don
game is ready to start, and might fill
the shoes of graduated QB Gene
Menses. Tacklcs Jack Adams and |
Sal Cardinally guard Dick Bondelie,
and Stan Wacholz are the other new !
staiters. End Ray Pozenkoff, center:
Keith Carpenter, guard Vern Valler
camp, and halfbacks Bob Osborne j
and Gibby Mendonsa, and fullback
Bob Amaral starters against USF, j
will complete the starting offensive |
unit.
Mendosa Best Halfback
Mendosa has been refered to by
Bronzan as the best halfback in the j
nation, pound for pound. Gibby tips j
the scales at only 167, dripping wet. \
Osborne is a slashing running of the
single wing type. Fullback Amaral
! started last year at end for the Spar
: tans. He is a good blocker and has
J drive.
End Wacholz is"in the peculiar po- I
sition of being apparently so good !
that he has trouble finding a home
in the lineup. He is capable of play
ing any position and doing it well, j
but this week he is lighting at the
Hanker spot. He may see limited de- '
fensive action.
Right tackle spot is still open and
might go to Bob Fox over Cardinali.
The two have battled on even terms :
and the spot could go to either man. ,
Cardinali, who weighs 234 has a J
26 lb. advantage on the 'lighter" Fox. i
Defensively, Halfback Matt Vuje
vich has earned a starting berth.
Tlie rest of the defensive starters are
somewhat doubtful, however Jon
Petersen, Archie Chagonjian, and
1 several offensive players will be the ;
nucleus of the defense.
Single-Wing to be Used
Bill Perry, Spartan line coach, has
stated that the Spartans will defi
nitely use some single wing plays
against the Indians. He explained
that they did not use their single
wing against USF because Jerry
Hamilton, QB, was sidelined with an
injury.
His replacement, Lurry Rice, was
lacking in single wing experience.
With Hamilton now ready to play
part time signal caller, watch for
single wing action whenever he goes
into the game.
The use of single wing plays won't
come as a surprise to Stanford, but
rather as a pleasure. Not only has
the Brave Junior Varsity been run
ning single wing plays against the
first Varsity defensive unit, but Stan
ford travels to meet Michigan next
week and is then home again to meet
UCLA. Both teams employ the
single wing almost exclusively and
any practice the Golden Raiders
throw the Indian's way will be ap
preciated.
The Indians are ready for the in
vading Spartans. After three days
of rough and tough scrimmage, Stan
ford practice tapered off yesterday to
running through plays and perfect
ing timing. The Big Red Machine
should run just a little more smoothly
than last week when six fumbles and
numerous penalties bogged down the
'51 model. More light work is on tap
for this afternoon's session.
Coach Chuck Taylor has suggested
that San Jose might be in for a rough

afternoon via the air ways. Passing
drill has been emphasized this week
and quarterbacks Gary Kerkorian
and Bob Garrett just might keep
Spartan pass defenders busier than
ants at a picnic. Watch for Stan-

ford's halfbacks to do a bit of throw
ing this year also.
Stanford's starting offensive lineup
will be the same that opened against
the Ducks up North. Definitely out
tomorrow are Wes Laubscher, John

Steinberg, and Barry Smith. Bob
Mathias is still a question mark. He
missed practice entirely yesterday,
on doctor's orders, when he pulled
a muscle in his leg: a result of favor
ing his nearly healed bruised toe.
Also doubtful is Bob Latham, speedy
tackle, who has come up with a cold.
There will be no preliminary game.

ing any position and doing it well, j
but this week he is lighting at the
Hanker spot. He may see limited de- '
fensive action.
Right tackle spot is still open and
might go to Bob Fox over Cardinali.
The two have battled on even terms :
and the spot could go to either man. ,
Cardinali, who weighs 234 has a J
26 lb. advantage on the 'lighter" Fox. i
Defensively, Halfback Matt Vuje
vich has earned a starting berth.
Tlie rest of the defensive starters are
somewhat doubtful, however Jon
Petersen, Archie Chagonjian, and
1 several offensive players will be the ;
nucleus of the defense.
Single-Wing to be Used
Bill Perry, Spartan line coach, has
stated that the Spartans will defi
nitely use some single wing plays
against the Indians. He explained
that they did not use their single
wing against USF because Jerry
Hamilton, QB, was sidelined with an
injury.
His replacement, Lurry Rice, was
lacking in single wing experience.
With Hamilton now ready to play
part time signal caller, watch for
single wing action whenever he goes
into the game.
The use of single wing plays won't
come as a surprise to Stanford, but
rather as a pleasure. Not only has
the Brave Junior Varsity been run
ning single wing plays against the
first Varsity defensive unit, but Stan
ford travels to meet Michigan next
week and is then home again to meet
UCLA. Both teams employ the
single wing almost exclusively and
any practice the Golden Raiders
throw the Indian's way will be ap
preciated.
The Indians are ready for the in
vading Spartans. After three days
of rough and tough scrimmage, Stan
ford practice tapered off yesterday to
running through plays and perfect
ing timing. The Big Red Machine
should run just a little more smoothly
than last week when six fumbles and
numerous penalties bogged down the
'51 model. More light work is on tap
for this afternoon's session.
Coach Chuck Taylor has suggested
that San Jose might be in for a rough

afternoon via the air ways. Passing
drill has been emphasized this week
and quarterbacks Gary Kerkorian
and Bob Garrett just might keep
Spartan pass defenders busier than
ants at a picnic. Watch for Stan-

ford's halfbacks to do a bit of throw
ing this year also.
Stanford's starting offensive lineup
will be the same that opened against
the Ducks up North. Definitely out
tomorrow are Wes Laubscher, John

Steinberg, and Barry Smith. Bob
Mathias is still a question mark. He
missed practice entirely yesterday,
on doctor's orders, when he pulled
a muscle in his leg: a result of favor
ing his nearly healed bruised toe.
Also doubtful is Bob Latham, speedy
tackle, who has come up with a cold.
There will be no preliminary game.

Stanford's footballing Indians will go after their second win of
the young season tomorrow when they take to the warpath against
an underdog San Jose State eleven in the Stadium. Kickoff is 2:00.
Odds makers, who have a habit of being as right as rain, have

Stanford's footballing Indians will go after their second win of
the young season tomorrow when they take to the warpath against
an underdog San Jose State eleven in the Stadium. Kickoff is 2:00.
Odds makers, who have a habit of being as right as rain, have
established the Cards as forty point favorites in tomorrow's battle.

j Twenty thousand onlookers are ex
pected to be on hand. The odds are
I not based on Stanford's showing
1 against Oregon but rather on the 39 j
; to 2 blasting that ths Spartans suf
fered at th!S hands of USF last week.
However tne lopsided odds might i
; be just a little too heavy on the Stan- J
ford end of the scale as San Jose's
head coach has shaken up his lineup j
in hopes of rebounding from the !
depths of defeat. Bob Bronzan is the j
coach that could work wonders.
Many consider the 32-year-old
: Spartan Mentor as one of the out- j
standing young coaches in the coun
try. Last year at Stite, Bronzan
turned out a team which won six, 1
I tied one and lost three while play- j
ing the toughest schedule in the
school's history.
Ofiensc Juggled
This week Bronzan has put his j
1 charges through rugged scrimmages |
stressing aggressiveness, not neces- j
sarily technique. Bronzan was also
concerned with bringing his squad
out of the psychological dumps. Just
: how well he succeeded will be known j
at four-thirty Saturday.
One thing for certain that came out [
of the week's work is that the Spar- |
tans will open the game with a jug
glerl offensive unit, which will in
clude five new faces. Quarterback
' Lynn Aplanalp who missed the Don
game is ready to start, and might fill
the shoes of graduated QB Gene
Menses. Tacklcs Jack Adams and |
Sal Cardinally guard Dick Bondelie,
and Stan Wacholz are the other new !
staiters. End Ray Pozenkoff, center:
Keith Carpenter, guard Vern Valler
camp, and halfbacks Bob Osborne j
and Gibby Mendonsa, and fullback
Bob Amaral starters against USF, j
will complete the starting offensive |
unit.
Mendosa Best Halfback
Mendosa has been refered to by
Bronzan as the best halfback in the j
nation, pound for pound. Gibby tips j
the scales at only 167, dripping wet. \
Osborne is a slashing running of the
single wing type. Fullback Amaral
! started last year at end for the Spar
: tans. He is a good blocker and has
J drive.
End Wacholz is"in the peculiar po- I
sition of being apparently so good !
that he has trouble finding a home
in the lineup. He is capable of play
ing any position and doing it well, j
but this week he is lighting at the
Hanker spot. He may see limited de- '
fensive action.
Right tackle spot is still open and
might go to Bob Fox over Cardinali.
The two have battled on even terms :
and the spot could go to either man. ,
Cardinali, who weighs 234 has a J
26 lb. advantage on the 'lighter" Fox. i
Defensively, Halfback Matt Vuje
vich has earned a starting berth.
Tlie rest of the defensive starters are
somewhat doubtful, however Jon
Petersen, Archie Chagonjian, and
1 several offensive players will be the ;
nucleus of the defense.
Single-Wing to be Used
Bill Perry, Spartan line coach, has
stated that the Spartans will defi
nitely use some single wing plays
against the Indians. He explained
that they did not use their single
wing against USF because Jerry
Hamilton, QB, was sidelined with an
injury.
His replacement, Lurry Rice, was
lacking in single wing experience.
With Hamilton now ready to play
part time signal caller, watch for
single wing action whenever he goes
into the game.
The use of single wing plays won't
come as a surprise to Stanford, but
rather as a pleasure. Not only has
the Brave Junior Varsity been run
ning single wing plays against the
first Varsity defensive unit, but Stan
ford travels to meet Michigan next
week and is then home again to meet
UCLA. Both teams employ the
single wing almost exclusively and
any practice the Golden Raiders
throw the Indian's way will be ap
preciated.
The Indians are ready for the in
vading Spartans. After three days
of rough and tough scrimmage, Stan
ford practice tapered off yesterday to
running through plays and perfect
ing timing. The Big Red Machine
should run just a little more smoothly
than last week when six fumbles and
numerous penalties bogged down the
'51 model. More light work is on tap
for this afternoon's session.
Coach Chuck Taylor has suggested
that San Jose might be in for a rough

afternoon via the air ways. Passing
drill has been emphasized this week
and quarterbacks Gary Kerkorian
and Bob Garrett just might keep
Spartan pass defenders busier than
ants at a picnic. Watch for Stan-

ford's halfbacks to do a bit of throw
ing this year also.
Stanford's starting offensive lineup
will be the same that opened against
the Ducks up North. Definitely out
tomorrow are Wes Laubscher, John

Steinberg, and Barry Smith. Bob
Mathias is still a question mark. He
missed practice entirely yesterday,
on doctor's orders, when he pulled
a muscle in his leg: a result of favor
ing his nearly healed bruised toe.
Also doubtful is Bob Latham, speedy
tackle, who has come up with a cold.
There will be no preliminary game.
