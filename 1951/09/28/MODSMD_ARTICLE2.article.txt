TKHRAN, Iran, Sept. 27—Iranian
soldiers took over the giant Abadan
refinery of the nationalized Anglo-
Iranian Oil Company today in a
swift move which locked British
technicians outside the refinery
gates.
Only 10 key Britons of the more
than 300 technicians who have been
told to get out of Iran by Oct. 4,
were given passes to the refinery
by the Iranians who effected the
seizure at dawn.
In Tehran, meanwhile, Premier
Moh; mined Mossadegh pledged that
Iran would '"struggle" against Brit
ain for its rights as a crowd outside
Parliament wept and shouted "Let
us kill—death to them."
British circles here, meanwhile,
said Britain had no intention of us
ing force against Iran.
