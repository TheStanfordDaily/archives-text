# Parking Troubles
## 
### 
The parking problem is bad enough as it is
at Stanford, but there are a few characters
around who seem determined to make it worse.
One of the worst type of offender is the un
thinking character who takes up two spaces
v/ith one car by ignoring the white parking lines
extending from curbs.
It was about this type of menace that an off
campus student was talking the other day. He
had just counted several good parking spaces
made useless by sloppy parking and he had
a suggestion.
Why not make the white lines longer and
brighter?" he said. Why not? As it is now,
the lines are too short. A driver can hardly see
if he is in a parking space or not. Also lines
are getting very dim, but Corporation Yard men

have already started the long task of repainting.
Police Chief Gordon Davis thought extend
ing the white lines into the street another six
feet or so v/ould help some, but not much. "The
big trouble is carelessness rather than short
lines," he said. Davis said the simplest way
was still the best way; leave your car home and
walk if you possibly can, but if you do park,
take time to do a careful job. The chief also said
that tickets would continue to be handed out to
parking violators.
Getting back to longer white lines, though,
why couldn't the idea be tried out on a trial
basis in one area. Police could check to see if
more paint pays off in more room for autos. It
might help.
