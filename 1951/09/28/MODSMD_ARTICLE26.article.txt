### DICK McLEAN 
RETURN OF THE ROARING TWENTIES
The days of the flappei's and the close clipped hair,
the era of the Racoon coat and the hip flask, the age
of bathtub gin and the spirit of the wild twenties is
not dead. It shall return.
As World War I and Prohibition brought about the
first "Flaming Age," the draft jitters and the new
liquor law will produce a second. The Slate of Cali
fornia and the Board of Equilization shall have its
way. But certain innovations in campus routine and
campus spirit will emerge.
The sale of shaving lotion. Bay Rum. and Hadacol
will skyrocket. Little gardens lull of ln>ps will
blossom all over this fertile farm. Juniper berries
will wink their violet eyes from among the ancient
ivy leaves. Grape juice will be sold in gallon tins
rather than the six ounce cans. The Chemistry De
partment will lie forced to add to their curriculum
Fermentation 1 and 2. Yes indeed, this will be a
bubbling little campus.
Bathing in bathtubs will have to go. Showers will
be the only method of keeping clean as the bathtubs
will be put to a more important use. The plumbers
in Palo Alto will do a thriving business cleaning tub
drains. The poor men will walk out the house scratch
ing their heads and mumbling, "Now how could stems
and grape skins clog the drain of a bathtub in a girl's
dormitory?" Housemothers will comment. "My what
a clever idea! Someone dyed the bathtub purple."
A whole new vocabulary will spring up. Expres
sions like "batch" and "tubstull"' will be added to
the freshman handbook. "See you on Quad" will
be replaced by "see you when the batch is ripe."

Obscure, introverted chemistry students will become
campus heroes. (It takes a thorough knowledge of
science to be a real brewmaster.)
Those particular individuals who find some new
formula will be rich over night. Cadillacs and
Jaguares will be the ordinary among those in the
"know." Dormitories with large basements, or big
bathtubs, or roomy attics will prosper. These dormi
tories will soon be building swimming pools deep,
luxuriant pits suitable for any liquid and painted a
delicate shade of purple. Doorbells will give way to
peep-holes. "How do you do." will be replaced by
"Big Wally sent me."
Discussions all over the campus will change from
economics and politics to things like: "Yes, you do
have a point but I still maintain that Old Spice Shav
ing Lotion is best when cut with Yardley's Bay Rum
and just a slight dash of lemon extract." Or you'll be
just as liable to hear: "You leave it in the sun for
thiee days and then add five parts of Ethyl gasoline
to one part Angostura bitters." Or maybe you'll hear:
"Just taste the stuff. You like it? I can get as much
as you want. A gallon? Five? A hundred! Of course,
we might have to drain the pool . . ."
Undoubtedly, seme Stanford doctor will receive
the Nobel Prize for his outstanding essay "Fatality
Percentages from Wood Alcohol Poisoning in One
Thousand and Twenty-two Cases."
So buy your Racoon coat early, take one final fare
well bath, brush up on your Charleston, The pendu
lum of history is swinging in its backward sweep. The
"Roaring Twenties" shall return. Listen hard. You
can almost hear them coming.

peep-holes. "How do you do." will be replaced by
"Big Wally sent me."
Discussions all over the campus will change from
economics and politics to things like: "Yes, you do
have a point but I still maintain that Old Spice Shav
ing Lotion is best when cut with Yardley's Bay Rum
and just a slight dash of lemon extract." Or you'll be
just as liable to hear: "You leave it in the sun for
thiee days and then add five parts of Ethyl gasoline
to one part Angostura bitters." Or maybe you'll hear:
"Just taste the stuff. You like it? I can get as much
as you want. A gallon? Five? A hundred! Of course,
we might have to drain the pool . . ."

So buy your Racoon coat early, take one final fare
well bath, brush up on your Charleston, The pendu
lum of history is swinging in its backward sweep. The
"Roaring Twenties" shall return. Listen hard. You
can almost hear them coming.
RETURN OF THE ROARING TWENTIES
The days of the flappei's and the close clipped hair,
the era of the Racoon coat and the hip flask, the age
of bathtub gin and the spirit of the wild twenties is
not dead. It shall return.
As World War I and Prohibition brought about the
first "Flaming Age," the draft jitters and the new
liquor law will produce a second. The Slate of Cali
fornia and the Board of Equilization shall have its
way. But certain innovations in campus routine and
campus spirit will emerge.
The sale of shaving lotion. Bay Rum. and Hadacol
will skyrocket. Little gardens lull of ln>ps will
blossom all over this fertile farm. Juniper berries
will wink their violet eyes from among the ancient
ivy leaves. Grape juice will be sold in gallon tins
rather than the six ounce cans. The Chemistry De
partment will lie forced to add to their curriculum
Fermentation 1 and 2. Yes indeed, this will be a
bubbling little campus.
Bathing in bathtubs will have to go. Showers will
be the only method of keeping clean as the bathtubs
will be put to a more important use. The plumbers
in Palo Alto will do a thriving business cleaning tub
drains. The poor men will walk out the house scratch
ing their heads and mumbling, "Now how could stems
and grape skins clog the drain of a bathtub in a girl's
dormitory?" Housemothers will comment. "My what
a clever idea! Someone dyed the bathtub purple."
A whole new vocabulary will spring up. Expres
sions like "batch" and "tubstull"' will be added to
the freshman handbook. "See you on Quad" will
be replaced by "see you when the batch is ripe."

Obscure, introverted chemistry students will become
campus heroes. (It takes a thorough knowledge of
science to be a real brewmaster.)
Those particular individuals who find some new
formula will be rich over night. Cadillacs and
Jaguares will be the ordinary among those in the
"know." Dormitories with large basements, or big
bathtubs, or roomy attics will prosper. These dormi
tories will soon be building swimming pools deep,
luxuriant pits suitable for any liquid and painted a
delicate shade of purple. Doorbells will give way to
peep-holes. "How do you do." will be replaced by
"Big Wally sent me."
