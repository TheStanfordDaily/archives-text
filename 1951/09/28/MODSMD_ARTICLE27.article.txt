# 'A PLACE IN THE SUN'
## Movie Wins Praise on all Counts 
### DICK FREDELL 
"A Place in the Sun," now at the Stanford Theater
is such a superior movie that it is hard to know whjre
to begin singing its praises. It is a triumph on every
level — performance, direction, photography, sound,
cutting, and script.
Adapted from the Theodore Drieser novel, "An
American Tragedy," the picture tells the story of
young love run amock. Slum-bred George Eastman
(Montgomeiy Clift) is given a job in his rich Eastern
relatives' swim suit factory, but socially he is not ac
cepted by them.
Frustrated and lonely, he falls into an affair with a
dumpy factory girl named Alice Tripp (Shelley Wint
ers). and before long she is pregnant.
Poor Boy. Rich Girl
Meanwhile, George has fallen in love with Angela
Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), the social leader of the
town s younger set. and through her he begins to
make his maik in the world of Cadillac convertibles
and summer lakeshore homes.
The conflict centers around his duty to marry Alice,
who would keep him iorevei in the lower class, and
his desire to marry Angela, whose position can give
him a place in the sun. Alice is drowned, and the
remainder oi the film concerns itself with George's
murder trial.
( iift a restrained, intelligent performance that
makes George a thoroughly convincing young man
caught in a chain of events that he cannot control.
The over-all effect of the picture, in fact, is one of
sadness and cruelty of life, indiscriminately doling out
tragedy to three young people who don't deserve these
fates.

Elizabeth Taylor surprises with a .sensitive per
formance in which, for the first time, she justifies
her excessive publicity (and incidentally proves her
self one of the world's most beautiful women).
But it is Shelley Winters who runs away with the
acting honors. Her Alice Tripp is an unattractive
looking, but enormously pathetic creature who could
only have been brought to life by an actress of unusual
stature.
Winters Takes Honors
George Stevens' direction can be given much of the
credit for the fine acting. Working from an intelligent
and splendidly up-dated script, he has inspired his
stars to give, in each case, their best performances to
date.
Technically, the picture is among Hollywood's best.
The photography is startling and imaginative, filled
with brilliant and unique effects. For example, there
is the Clift-Taylor love scene—the finest ever filmed—
in which the camera's enormous close-ups actually
enter into the rhythm of their kiss.
Clever Sound Tracking
The sound track is a minor tour de force in itself.
The way recurrent sounds—the wail of a siren, the
barking of a dog—are brought to their climaxes makes
for as artistically an effective sound track as has been
done.
If the picture has a fault, it is the matter of climax.
There are two major ones: the drowning and the trial.
The second never approaches the intensity of the
first, resulting in an anti-climactic quality about the
long trial sequences.
Nevertheless, "A Place in the Sun" is a picture of
so many virtues, of such immediacy and warmth, that
it can he recommended to audiences without qualifi
cation. .

and summer lakeshore homes.
The conflict centers around his duty to marry Alice,
who would keep him iorevei in the lower class, and
his desire to marry Angela, whose position can give
him a place in the sun. Alice is drowned, and the
remainder oi the film concerns itself with George's
murder trial.
( iift a restrained, intelligent performance that
makes George a thoroughly convincing young man
caught in a chain of events that he cannot control.
The over-all effect of the picture, in fact, is one of
sadness and cruelty of life, indiscriminately doling out
tragedy to three young people who don't deserve these
fates.

Elizabeth Taylor surprises with a .sensitive per
formance in which, for the first time, she justifies
her excessive publicity (and incidentally proves her
self one of the world's most beautiful women).
But it is Shelley Winters who runs away with the
acting honors. Her Alice Tripp is an unattractive
looking, but enormously pathetic creature who could
only have been brought to life by an actress of unusual
stature.
Winters Takes Honors
George Stevens' direction can be given much of the
credit for the fine acting. Working from an intelligent
and splendidly up-dated script, he has inspired his
stars to give, in each case, their best performances to
date.
Technically, the picture is among Hollywood's best.
The photography is startling and imaginative, filled
with brilliant and unique effects. For example, there
is the Clift-Taylor love scene—the finest ever filmed—
in which the camera's enormous close-ups actually
enter into the rhythm of their kiss.
Clever Sound Tracking
The sound track is a minor tour de force in itself.
The way recurrent sounds—the wail of a siren, the
barking of a dog—are brought to their climaxes makes
for as artistically an effective sound track as has been
done.
If the picture has a fault, it is the matter of climax.
There are two major ones: the drowning and the trial.
The second never approaches the intensity of the
first, resulting in an anti-climactic quality about the
long trial sequences.
Nevertheless, "A Place in the Sun" is a picture of
so many virtues, of such immediacy and warmth, that
it can he recommended to audiences without qualifi
cation. .
"A Place in the Sun," now at the Stanford Theater
is such a superior movie that it is hard to know whjre
to begin singing its praises. It is a triumph on every
level — performance, direction, photography, sound,
cutting, and script.
Adapted from the Theodore Drieser novel, "An
American Tragedy," the picture tells the story of
young love run amock. Slum-bred George Eastman
(Montgomeiy Clift) is given a job in his rich Eastern
relatives' swim suit factory, but socially he is not ac
cepted by them.
Frustrated and lonely, he falls into an affair with a
dumpy factory girl named Alice Tripp (Shelley Wint
ers). and before long she is pregnant.
Poor Boy. Rich Girl
Meanwhile, George has fallen in love with Angela
Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), the social leader of the
town s younger set. and through her he begins to
make his maik in the world of Cadillac convertibles
and summer lakeshore homes.
