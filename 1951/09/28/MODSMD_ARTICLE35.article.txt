# Farm's Hoover Keeps Farm Fervor
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
A current lifetime member of
the Stanford student body, a Uni
versity board of trustees mem
ber since 1912, and probably the
school's most famous alumnus,
former United States president
Herbert Hoover continues to
take an active working interest
in his alma mater.
On the 11th floor of the tower
which lie founded and which bears
his name, the nation's only living
ek-President still maintains an of
fice, set aside for him when the
tower was built. He used it most
recently this summer when he .spent
August vacationing on the Farm.
The ofTicc was planned as a
place where Hoover could work
in privacy during his stays at the
University, and as a place he
could consider his in the country
which his associates say he still
calls home, though business rea
sons keep him in the East.
His work now consists of consul
tations, attending to his interests in
numerous institutions and organi
zations, and keeping up an enor
mous correspondence. He is also
currently writing the story of his
life. The first Volume, which in
cludes his student years at Stan
ford, is expected to be published in
the near future.
The ex - President .worked on
his hook during his stav at Stan
ford this summer, as well as pre
paring the speech he ,**avc in lowa
Aug. .'5O. Though President and
Mrs. Wallace Sterling were gone,
at their invitation Hoover stayed
in the president's residence, the
Lou Henry Hoover I louse, which
he originally built for his late
wife.
Stanford business was also on his
summer agenda. As a member of j
the board, he attended trustees' j
meetings and took his usual active !
part in University planning.
In addition to founding the Hoo
ver Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace, he was a principal back
er of such projects as the present
Student Union, the Graduate School
of Business, and the Food Research
Institute. He is officially titled the
first student to enter the University
when it was founded, and acpoHing
to the document presented him on
his 75th birthday in 1950, he will
remain all his life a current mem
ber of the ASSU.
Doc u m cuts proclaiming his
Stanford honors as well as many
awards from all over the world
are housed in his Hoover Tower
ofTicc. The walls of the en
trance room are lined with framed
documents in many languages.
The varied honorary university
degrees have a special signifi
cance for the former President,
who worked his way through
Stanford.
Some of the documents thank
him for the relief work he did after
World War I. One of the most in
teresting came from Russia, which
requested his help dining a famine
which occurred after the retrular

relief programs were over, lie ar
ranged for aid through private
tunc!;;, and as an expression of grat
itude he was given a huge sheep
skin scroll embroidered and painted !
in bright colors. The proclamation
includes a wish for lasting friend
ship between Kussia and the United
States. But it is dated 1923!
Hoover's own office is a hitfh
ceilinged room paneled in dark i
wood. A green upholstered chair
stands behind a big brown desk
overlooking Inner Quad. Behind
the desk stand an American Hag j

and the official flag of the Presi
dent of (lit' United States. Each
President has two official flags:
one for his executive office, the
other for his study; and these are
ftiven him when he leaves office.
"The Chief," as his staff calls him,
still takes an active interest in stu
dent body life. He considered a
visit by the ASSU officers one of
the highlights of his summer stay.
He continues to follow Stanford
athletics whenever he can, and is a
regular listener to the Big Gpme.
