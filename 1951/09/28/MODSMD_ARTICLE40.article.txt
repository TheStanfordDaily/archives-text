### 

SUBVERSIVE ELEMENTS??? students and passers-by on Es
condido Road in front of Stern Hall yesterday were greeted by
the replica of a Communist China Flag hanging from a Stern
second-floor window. The "flag" was displayed from room
238, but the room residents could not be contacted for comment.
