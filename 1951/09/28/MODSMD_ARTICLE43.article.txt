# Intersectionals Grab Spotlight
## 
### 
Tennessee, rated as the best in the
nation before playing a game, opens
its campaign as a 14-point choice
over Mississippi State while burly
Texas is a seven-point choice to clown
Purdue and California's depth makes
the Golden Bears a 13-point pick over
Penn.
Two close contests are slated for
the TV airways. Eastern viewers will
see the Duke-Pittsburgh scuffle,
where the southerners are seven

point choices. Western observers will
get the Navy-Yale contest, in which
the embryo sailors are six-point
favorites.
Six intersectional battles headline
the mid-western program, topped by
the Texas invasion of Purdue. The
Longhorns, who stopped the passing
of Babe Parilli in beating Kentucky
last week, now must handcuff an
other aerial artist in Dale Samuels.
