# Braves Top Dodgers, 4-3

### 
BOSTON, Sept. 27 (UP) —Terror
struck the heart of Flatbush today
as the Boston Braves came from
behind to beat the first - place
Brooklyn Dodgers, 4-3, and cut
their National League lead to a
half-game over the onrushing New
York Giants, who were idle.
Deadlocked at three - all going
into the bottom of the eighth, the
Braves got to veteran pitcher El
win (Preacher) Roe for two hits
and pushed across a run precipi
tating an argument which ultimate
ly saw the Dodger bench cleared.
Dodgers Ejected
First, catcher Hoy Campanella
and coach Cookie Lavagetto were
ordered from the field by plate
umpire Frank Dascoli, whose
"safe" decision on the run was
disputed. But the taunts from the
Dodger bench became so cutting
that Dascoli walked over and or
dered all but manager Charley
D'ressen and coach Jake Pitler to
the clubhouse. Fifteen Dodgers
stalked from the field with Ralph
Branca, the last man in line, kick
ing dirt across the plate.
Maybe the ejection of Campanella
lost the game and even the pennant.
For in the ninth clutch - slugging
Campy would have come to bat
with a man on third and one out.
He was in the clubhouse by then,
though, and the Dodger threat was
snuffed out.
Playoff Might Result
The result today means this: The
Dodgers still can clinch the pennant
if they win all three of their re
maining games—all against Phila
delphia — even if the Giants win
both their remaining games against
the Braves.
If there's a tie for the pennant,
as thcve might be, a three-game
playoff will begin Monday at
Brooklyn and continue Tuesday
and Wednesday at New York.
Eighth Inning Crucial
But maybe it was ail decided in
that tense eighth inning today. Bob
Addis started it off by singling to
center for the Braves and Sam
Jethroe sent him to third with a

single over second base. Ear! Tor
geson was next. He hit a grounder
to Jackie Robinson at second base,
and Robby played for home.
Addis came streaking in and slid
under Campanella. Dascoli roared
"safe" and waved his palms vio
lently. The argument broke, with
Campanella screaming. But the run
was in.
Rookie Chet Nichols, 20-year
old Pawtucket, R. 1., southpaw,
went the distance for the Braves
and turned in a sterling mound
performance. lie scattered six
Brooklyn hits—five of them dur
ing the first six innings — and
pulled out of holes with strike
out hurling at two crucial points.
Four in a Row
The Red Sox, who have been go
ing in reverse ever since the Yan
kees cut their hearts out last week
end in Boston, lost their last mathe
matical chances for the pennant
when the Senators defeated them
for the third straight time, 8 to G,
in Washington. Boston now has lost
four in a row and seven of the last
eight games.
Rookie Harry (Duke) Markell,
making his first start for the St.
Louis Browns, had a winning debut
when he pitched thern to a 7 to 4
victory over the Tigers. Matt Batts
hit a St. Louis homer and Johnny
Groth got one for Detroit.
There were no other major league
games scheduled.
