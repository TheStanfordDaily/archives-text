CORVALI IS, Ore., Sept. 27 (UP)
Utah's vaunted passing attack
plainly had Coach Kip Taylor wor
ried today as he sent his Oregon
State football team through a long
. crimmage in preparation for the

home opener here Saturday.
The Beavers also put in consid- j
erable time adding polish to their J
own offen.e. Bob Redkey, better
known as a defensive linebacker,
I looked very good on offense and i-;
I likely to see action in both roles
i Saturday.
