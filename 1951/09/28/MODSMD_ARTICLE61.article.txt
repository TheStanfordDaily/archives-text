SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 27 (UP) ■
—Quarterback Ed Brown and full- ;
back Ollie Mat on were the offen
sive sparks today of an hour and {
one-half University of San Fran- J
ci.-co football team workout in j
preparation for the game Saturday 1
at Boise against Idaho.
The 24-man traveling squad will
leave by air tomorrow, but left end
Merrill Peacock, who caught three
touchdown passes against San Jose j
State, will remain home because of
injuries.

Stanford's first string halfback last
year, Bobby White, survived a final
.squad cut of the pro San Francisco
49ers. White's currently playing sec
ond string behind Jos Arenas, an
other rookie.

The Spartan.s will come to Palo i
Alto tomorrow fielding one of the ;
i heaviest defensive lines in Bay Area
history. The line averages 226 pounds
I from stem to stern.

i The age of specialization is upon
| us. USC employs a i40-pound fresh- |
man to kick extra points and one of j
the assistant managers suits up for
the games to hold the ball for the
kicker.
