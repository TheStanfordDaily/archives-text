# Reg Total Still Lags
## 
### 
Registration figures hit 7,211 by
noon yesterday, still short of pre
registration estimates of 7,300, but
Registrar Harvey Hall expected the
total to mount. Registration to date
is 23. r > blow enrollment at the same
time last fall.
A breakdown shows a total regis
tration of 5,212 men and one short
of 2.000 women. No figures were
available on freshman registration,
hut Hall thought this year's class
the largest as anticipated. Regis
tration will continue through Oct.
17.
Courses can be dropped with a
minimum of red tape through next
week, by picking up a revised study
card at the registration information
office, Room 111 A, Inner Quad, and
having it signed by the instructors
involved and the student's adviser.
After next week petitions must
be submitted to the registration
committee. No course may be
dropped during the last four weeks
of the quarter for anv reason.
Hall urged students dropping or
adding courses not to go under or
exceed their unit requirements.
New lower division students can
not register for more than 16. Oth
er undrgraduates cannot take more
than 18 unless they have main
tained a "B" average. In all cases
13 units is the minimum per quar
ter.
