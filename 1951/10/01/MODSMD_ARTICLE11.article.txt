# Indians Fall into Second Win, 26-13, Over Underrated San Jose State Team
## Kerkorian's 68-Yard Run, McColl's Catch Spark Cards Over Stubborn Spartan Eleven 
### LARRY CAHN 
Leaving their firewater in the tepee, Stanford's listless Indians
collected their second scalp of the young season by overcoming
an underrated San Jose State eleven, 26 to 13, in the Stadium
Saturday.
It's hard to believe that this Spartan eleven was the same team

that only a week before had been
routed 39 to 2 by USF and had been
posted as 25- to 40-point underdogs
against the Cards.
Spartans Score
It was San Jose which scored first,
and it was the Spartans who kept
running through a supposedly
strong Stanford forward defense to
gain 141 yards while passing against
a secondary for an additional 121
yards.
However, all is not gloom for the
Indians. Stanford had the ability to
come from behind for the second
week in a row. Not only did the
scoreboard with the broken clock
favor the Cards but also the statis
tics to which 20,000 onlookers might
not attest.
Opening Kickoff
It started out just as expected
with Harry Hugasian taking the
opening kickoff and bringing it back
to the Card 42. Then two quick
tosses from Gary Kerkorian to Bill
McColl picked up a first down on
the Spartan 45.
However, following two runs and
a penalty, Stanford was forced to
kick and Dick Horn got off a beauty
that rolled, dead on the one-yard
line.
Cards Penalized
But a penalty against the Cards
brought the ball back, and Horn's
next effort rolled into the end zone
and was brought out to the 20.
It was then the Golden Raiders'
turn and away they went. Sparked
by quarterback Lynn Aplanalp, who
missed the USF game with an in
jury, the Spartans marched 74 yards
in 12 plays only to be denied a
touchdown when fullback Bob
Sykes fumbled on the Stanford six
and Ron Eadie fell on the loose ball.

State Not Stopped
But State was not to be stopped.
Following a poor kick by Dick Horn
that went out of bounds on the Card
35, Spartan backs Bob Osborne and
A1 Matthews drove to the six.
Osborne, stopped on three line
smacks, went into the end zone on
fourth down for the initial score.
The try for extra point by Dale
Sumers was blocked by A1 Kirk
land.
It wasn't until the first play of
the second quarter, when linebacker
Ted Tanner picked off an Aplanalp
pass and went out of bounds on
the visitors' 26, that Stanford
threatened. With Eric Southwood
and Hugasian packing the mail, the
Indians found themselves with
fourth down and goal to go on the
eight.
All-American Catch
Kerkorian faded back and threw

to his right into the end zone where i
McColl, covered well by Gibby
Mendonsa and Archie Chagonjian,
plunged between the two to come
down with the ball in a catch that
only an Ail-American could make.
Kerkorian added the extra point J
with Hugasian holding.
And it was Kerkorian moments
later who thrilled the crowd with
the longest run of the day, and one
of the finest seen in the Stadium in
many a year.
Fading to pass, Kerkorian was I
momentarily trapped; swinging)
wide to his right, he was tripped up
by Jack Carhart, but regained his
staggering balance and was off.
Directed Blockers
Directing his blockers as an offi
cer directs traffic, Kerkorian made
the most of blocks by Rod Garner,
Norm Manoogian, and Bill Storum
to scamper 68 twisting yards to pay
dirt and Stanford's second TD. The
extra point attempt was partially
blocked and sailed wide.
The second half started as experts ,
had picked the entire came to go.
Following the kickoff, Spartan back
Matthews fumbled on the State 31

times the remainder of the third
period with neither team being able
to generate a (hive.
Last Period
Opening the last period. Stanford
used a new backfield of Bob Gar- j
rett at QB, Billy Heilbron and Bob |
Bryan at hall's, and Skip Crist at
fullback. In some respects it looked j
better than the starting quartet.
Starting on their own 34, they |
marched in .six plays to the State 13.
Leaving their firewater in the tepee, Stanford's listless Indians
collected their second scalp of the young season by overcoming
an underrated San Jose State eleven, 26 to 13, in the Stadium
Saturday.
It's hard to believe that this Spartan eleven was the same team

that only a week before had been
routed 39 to 2 by USF and had been
posted as 25- to 40-point underdogs
against the Cards.
Spartans Score
It was San Jose which scored first,
and it was the Spartans who kept
running through a supposedly
strong Stanford forward defense to
gain 141 yards while passing against
a secondary for an additional 121
yards.
However, all is not gloom for the
Indians. Stanford had the ability to
come from behind for the second
week in a row. Not only did the
scoreboard with the broken clock
favor the Cards but also the statis
tics to which 20,000 onlookers might
not attest.
Opening Kickoff
It started out just as expected
with Harry Hugasian taking the
opening kickoff and bringing it back
to the Card 42. Then two quick
tosses from Gary Kerkorian to Bill
McColl picked up a first down on
the Spartan 45.
However, following two runs and
a penalty, Stanford was forced to
kick and Dick Horn got off a beauty
that rolled, dead on the one-yard
line.
Cards Penalized
But a penalty against the Cards
brought the ball back, and Horn's
next effort rolled into the end zone
and was brought out to the 20.
It was then the Golden Raiders'
turn and away they went. Sparked
by quarterback Lynn Aplanalp, who
missed the USF game with an in
jury, the Spartans marched 74 yards
in 12 plays only to be denied a
touchdown when fullback Bob
Sykes fumbled on the Stanford six
and Ron Eadie fell on the loose ball.

State Not Stopped
But State was not to be stopped.
Following a poor kick by Dick Horn
that went out of bounds on the Card
35, Spartan backs Bob Osborne and
A1 Matthews drove to the six.
Osborne, stopped on three line
smacks, went into the end zone on
fourth down for the initial score.
The try for extra point by Dale
Sumers was blocked by A1 Kirk
land.
It wasn't until the first play of
the second quarter, when linebacker

v/fis knocking at pay dirt again, j
This time ii was a gamble by Apia- I
nalp that failed and gave the Cards |
ball possession on San Jose's 42.
Alter driving to the 13 on a good
sequence of plays, Meyers slashed j
to the two where he fumbled, the j
b;dl rolling into the end zone. Hu-'
gasian promptly fell on the ball for [
six points.
The ball exchanged hands five j
times the remainder of the third
period with neither team being able
to generate a (hive.
Last Period
Opening the last period. Stanford
used a new backfield of Bob Gar- j
rett at QB, Billy Heilbron and Bob |
Bryan at hall's, and Skip Crist at
fullback. In some respects it looked j
better than the starting quartet.
Starting on their own 34, they |
marched in .six plays to the State 13.
Leaving their firewater in the tepee, Stanford's listless Indians
collected their second scalp of the young season by overcoming
an underrated San Jose State eleven, 26 to 13, in the Stadium
Saturday.
It's hard to believe that this Spartan eleven was the same team

that only a week before had been
routed 39 to 2 by USF and had been
posted as 25- to 40-point underdogs
against the Cards.
Spartans Score
It was San Jose which scored first,
and it was the Spartans who kept
running through a supposedly
strong Stanford forward defense to
gain 141 yards while passing against
a secondary for an additional 121
yards.
However, all is not gloom for the
Indians. Stanford had the ability to
come from behind for the second
week in a row. Not only did the
scoreboard with the broken clock
favor the Cards but also the statis
tics to which 20,000 onlookers might
not attest.
Opening Kickoff
It started out just as expected
with Harry Hugasian taking the
opening kickoff and bringing it back
to the Card 42. Then two quick
tosses from Gary Kerkorian to Bill
McColl picked up a first down on
the Spartan 45.
However, following two runs and
a penalty, Stanford was forced to
kick and Dick Horn got off a beauty
that rolled, dead on the one-yard
line.
Cards Penalized
But a penalty against the Cards
brought the ball back, and Horn's
next effort rolled into the end zone
and was brought out to the 20.
It was then the Golden Raiders'
turn and away they went. Sparked
by quarterback Lynn Aplanalp, who
missed the USF game with an in
jury, the Spartans marched 74 yards
in 12 plays only to be denied a
touchdown when fullback Bob
Sykes fumbled on the Stanford six
and Ron Eadie fell on the loose ball.

State Not Stopped
But State was not to be stopped.
Following a poor kick by Dick Horn
that went out of bounds on the Card
35, Spartan backs Bob Osborne and
A1 Matthews drove to the six.
Osborne, stopped on three line
smacks, went into the end zone on
fourth down for the initial score.
The try for extra point by Dale
Sumers was blocked by A1 Kirk
land.
It wasn't until the first play of
the second quarter, when linebacker
Ted Tanner picked off an Aplanalp
pass and went out of bounds on
the visitors' 26, that Stanford
threatened. With Eric Southwood
and Hugasian packing the mail, the
Indians found themselves with
fourth down and goal to go on the
eight.
All-American Catch
Kerkorian faded back and threw

to his right into the end zone where i
McColl, covered well by Gibby
Mendonsa and Archie Chagonjian,
plunged between the two to come
down with the ball in a catch that
only an Ail-American could make.
Kerkorian added the extra point J
with Hugasian holding.
And it was Kerkorian moments
later who thrilled the crowd with
the longest run of the day, and one
of the finest seen in the Stadium in
many a year.
Fading to pass, Kerkorian was I
momentarily trapped; swinging)
wide to his right, he was tripped up
by Jack Carhart, but regained his
staggering balance and was off.
Directed Blockers
Directing his blockers as an offi
cer directs traffic, Kerkorian made
the most of blocks by Rod Garner,
Norm Manoogian, and Bill Storum
to scamper 68 twisting yards to pay
dirt and Stanford's second TD. The
extra point attempt was partially
blocked and sailed wide.
The second half started as experts ,
had picked the entire came to go.
Following the kickoff, Spartan back
Matthews fumbled on the State 31
