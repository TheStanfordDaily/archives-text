### 
Two University of California stu
dents, one a budding track star,
were injured seriously Saturday
night when a home - made bomb,
constructed as a noise-making de
vice, exploded prematurely in a
campus dorm.
The blast was believed to have
ended the sports career of freshman
track star Laurence D. Anderson,
19, Glendale, one of the state's top
pole vaultcrs last year, who suffered
the loss of four fingers from one
hand and two from the other.
Robert W. Gardner, 18, a sopho
more from Eureka, was rushed to

surgery with fragments of the bomb
imbedded in his back.
Campus Policc Captain William
Wadman said the explosion oc
curred when Anderson, a chemical
engineering student, was putting
the finishing touches on a nine-inch
section of galvanized pipe crammed
with explosives.
Gardner was just leaving the
room after a chess game when the
bomb exploded.
The explosion rocked the univer
sity's Bowles Hall dorm, and chunks
of pipe were imbedded in the walls
and ceilings of the rooms.
