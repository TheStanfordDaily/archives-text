# Talks at Kaesong

### 
TOKYOâ€”Communist leaders were
on notice today that they will have
to move the deadlocked Korean
truce talks from Kaesong, or there
won't be any further talks.
Gen. Omar N. Bradley, chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
gave an irrevocable "no" to Com
munist demands that the United
Nations send cease-fire negotiators
back to the Red-held city which has
become a Communist propaganda
mill.
