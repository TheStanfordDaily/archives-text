# Marijuana Patch Found On University Property
## 86000 Crop Discovered by Police Near Stanford Campus; No Arrests Made 
### Hadley Roff 
One of the largest marijuana
crops ever discovered in San
Mateo County was found
flourishing less than a mile and
a half from the heart of the Stan
ford campus Friday night by
deputies from the San Mateo
County sheriff's office.
The $fi,ooo crop was found immedi
ately across San Francisquito Creek
from the Stanford Golf Course and
was on University property.
Law enforcers were working on an j
anonymous tip when they located the
marijuana patch that, according to
officers, was ready for harvesting.
The plants, some of which flowered
to heights of 15 feet, were uprooted
by the deputies.
No arrests were made in connec
tion with the discovery as officers said
they were more concerned with de
stroying the marijuana source than in
capturing the cultivators.
Largest Find
The crop.' described as "one of the
largest marijuana finds in recent Cal
itornia history," would have brought
more than $100 per pound if sold in
the underworld dope market.
Local implications of the marijuana
cultivation were not immediately
known by Inspector Carl Ferrell of
the San Mateo Sheriff's office, though
he said that there was some indi
cation that the sale of narcotics was
being directed toward students along
the peninsula. As yet the inspector
has found no link between the "weed" i
natch and possible users among the
o Vford student-body.
Ferrell, however, aid state that
"there has always been a traffic di
rected toward students and 'teen
agcrs" and that there is a busy nar
cotic distributing center "in a small 1
Santa Clara County town not too dis
tant from the University."
Peddlers Caught
"In San Mateo County" he said.
' four were picked up last week. All
were in their ear 1 / twenties and were
arrested handing out the weed to 'teen
agers."
Campus police said they knew

nothing of the raid and that they
have heard no reports of any local
marijuana peddling. Palo Alto police
made a similar statement.
The raid on the Stanford marijuana
patch was led by Inspector Paul B.
Jensen with Inspector Ferrell, and
J Frank Cambell and Sergeant Cole
| Stafford of the Redwood City police
participating.
Plantco Early
The marijuana found on the cam-
I pus had been planted early this year,
probably in April, Ferrell stated.
Though a well-trod path led to the
patch, the narcotic plants were so
well concealed among willow trees
| and'wild parsley that officers didn't
spot the weed until five feet distant.
While the officers were slashing
i down the dainty leaved plants, a
truck rumbled toward the area but
i whipped around and sped away when
] the officers were spotted.
The marijuana catch climaxed a
week of arrests by deputies of San
Mateo Sheriff Earl Whitmore, who
; said his department is "bent on
wiping out the marijuana problem
i that has grown large in the past few
I years."
