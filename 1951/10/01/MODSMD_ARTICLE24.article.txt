# Eating Clubs Host Students At Open House
## 
### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs will
hold their first open house since
they moved into their new building,
tomorrow night from 7:30 to 9:30,
when they throw open their doors
in an effort to get acquainted with
transfer students and those return
ing to Village and off-campus resi
dences.
"The idea of tomorrow's open
house," said A 1 Sieroty, president of
Interclub Council, "is to acquaint
.students with the eating club sys
tem, give them an opportunity to
meet club members, and show them
the new facilities."
All seven clubs will servo re
freshments during the open house,
and at least one eating club is serv
ing dinner earlier in the evening.
Plans are being completed to
form a car-pool at the Village in
order to provide transportation to
the open house for those students
who don't have their own cars.
Freshmen will have an opportu
nity to meet club members and roe
how the eating club system works
early in winter quarter.
