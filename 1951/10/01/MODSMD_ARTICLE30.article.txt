If OiHlen Nash were a Stanford student, he might
write a poem something like the following:

Stanford is a university
Of honor code tersity,
Of professional verboiseness,
And Donald E. Closeness.
The Farm has Lake Lagunita,
Which breeds the mosquita.
The }/nat and the fly,
Hut in the summer .it's dry.
I lie Chappie, I am told
Was indiscreetly hold,

So the Old Boy couldn't dish you
/in iniquitous last issue.
Although the Chappie isn't better

Than a Marvin O. Adams letter.
Marvin's criticism is profuse
Of Stanfordian abuse.
Which brings me to Stanford's Hoover,
Who was Coolidge's remover.
He rose to presidential power
And left us a tower.
Watch out for the football teamian
Which has many an Armenian,
Kerkorian, Essegian, Hugasian,
Manoogian. and the McColl sensation.
Stanford is where rolling foothills rise
And where Hoover tower touches the skys
Where Mrs. Stanford said,'"No booze."
And when rally com wears whiter saddle shoes.
