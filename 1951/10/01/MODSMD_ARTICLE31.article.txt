# COMMUNISM IN ASIA
## China Improves Economically But All Freedom Blacked Out 
### DAVID WONG 
Since the Communists came to power two years ago,
reliable information of conditions within China has
become increasingly scarce. Reports have been many,
but they are often conflicting, each having been
colored by the prejudices of the reporter. Therefore,
in the absence of a free exchange of information, one
can only pick up all the little pieces and try to form
a rough picture.
Recently, two friends of mine—an English mission
ary and a Chinese student—came out of Red China,
bringing with them thpir version of what is going on
within the country. For personal reasons, they wish
iiicir names withheld from publication. The follow
ing is a summary of what they have to say:
Economically, the country has made great im
provements since the Communists took over. Pro
duction figures have been rising while black mar
ket activities have been on the decrease. Vigorous
anti-inflation programs have done much to curb
inflation, the headache of the former Nationalist
(«overnmeut.
in the cities, the sewage, telephone, and other public
utility systems hav« been improved. In the country
dykes and roads, long left in various stages of dis
repair, have been rebuilt and new ones were also under
construction.
However, as far as freedom was concerned, there
was none. Freedom of speech and of action have

I,cen restricted, and an> oppo itiun to the official
policy was labelled as reactionary activity. Mid
night visits by the police were common affairs, and
one never knew when he would he taken away for
questioning.
Purges have been taking place in many areas, al
though the number of people executed was probably
not much greater than under the Nationalists. The
major differences were found in the greater publicity
attending the executions and the type of people being
executed.
The reaction of the people to the Communist
regime has been a sort of fatalistic acceptance of
an existing situation. They do not want the Com
munists to remain in power, but neither do they
want the return of the Nationalists. They hope that
in the end some kind of Socialistic government
could come to power. However, they realize that
that can be nothing but a pious dream for some
time to come.
As for the Korean War, the Communists have been
very successful in whipping up enthusiasm in the
country. Their propaganda, at once subtle and con
vincing. has continually stressed that South Korea
was the aggressor. No other version of the conflict
was allowed. Consequently, large numbers of students,
have volunteered for service in Korea.
Naturally, day-to-day reports of the fighting were
presented in distorted form to fit propaganda claims.
