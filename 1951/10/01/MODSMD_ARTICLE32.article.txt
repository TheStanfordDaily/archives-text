EZT-*™-
Stanford's Float Parade, usu
ally held before Big Game, will
be moved up this year to the Fri
day night before the UCLA
game.
One reason for the change, Car
dinals announced, is to allow Stan
ford to play the host for UCLA
rooters, who always have house
decorations and a big weekend of
activities when the game is played
down there. November weather
also enters into moving the date up,
because rain canceled out the pa
j ide last year.
Main theme ol the parade will be
for Bruin the Bell Tolls." Another
motif ol "Injun Eleven Sends Bruin
to Heaven" is also going to be used.
Floats can carry out the theme by
using such decorations as hearses.
Indian grave - diggers, angels, Roy
Alexander, over - all chairman of
the parade, said.
Sign-ups in the ASSU ollice must
Ij< made by Saturday. All living
■ roups should accompany their en
tries with a brief description of
t'leir float. There will be no dupli
< ition of floats, so living groups that
• i;;n up first will have their pick of
float themes.
