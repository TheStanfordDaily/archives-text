# Tryouts to Start for Gaieties
## 
### 
Ram's Head has issued its annual
call for talent needed to produce THE
musical show of the yearâ€”The Big
Game Gaieties, to be presented for
three nights preceding the Big
Game.
Tryouts will be held Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday evenings from
7 to 10 in the Ram's Head room down
the stairs at the back of Memorial
Auditorium.
Workers for all phases of the pro
duction are needed: actors, singers,
chorus members, dancers, orchestra

members, publicity workers, business
workers, and crew members for jobs
involving construction, painting,
properties, make-up, lighting, cos
tumes, and sound.
The show is written, produced, and
acted by students, and no previous
theatrical experience is necessary for
tryoutees. It would be appreciated if
students would bring and play their
own music at the tryouts, but a
pianist will be available for those who
cannot.
The Gaieties is the first of three

major shows produced by the Ram's
Head Board, Administrative Board in
charge of all dramatic activities on
campus. The other two shows are
the Winter One Acts, and the Spring
Show.
The Board also puts on minor pro
ductions when time and talent are
available*. Aside from these regular
activities, the Ram's Head Board pro
vides assistance in all phases of dra
matic endeavor to any group that
wishes to produce a show involving
live talent.
