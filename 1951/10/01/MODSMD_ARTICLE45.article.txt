SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30 (UP)
â€”Western football teams get another
crack at intersectional foes next
week-end as powerful California,
armed with one of the nation's most
devastating attacks, takes on Min
nesota; and Stanford, a probable Pa
cific Coast Conference weakling,
travels to the midwest to battle
Michigan.

Bryan, who ran with speed and in
spiration, then slashed to the three
where he fumbled. San Jose recov
ering.
The Spartans could do nothing
and kicked out to their own 42.
Again the "second - stringers" put
together ;i good-looking attack. It
was Bryan for six, Crist for one,
and a Garrett pass to Sam Morley
for a first down on the Spartan 28.
Threat Stopped
Then Heilbron at guard for three,
but Garrett was trapped for nine
lot. Bryan'broke lor 15. The threat
was stopped when Jerry Perich in
tercepted Garrett's pass.
That was all there was for the
Cards, but lite Spartans still had
scoring punch left in them and
tallied against a mixed Stanford de
fensive unit.
After Aplanalp was thrown for
two losses by Kirkland and Eadie.
the Spartans scored on a 38-yard
screen pass with Frank Morriss
carrying the mail, for State's pret
tiest play of the day.
Indians Good
That was it for the afternoon.
Stanford rooters still were won
deiing just how good the Indians
are and will learn next week when
they meet Michigan, perhaps a sec
ond-rater this year. Spartan fol
lowers were pleased with State'.-,
improvement but were asking just
how poor is Stanford.
