### United Press 
A surprisingly strong San
Francisco 49er team outplayed
Ihe champion Cleveland Browns
at Kezar Stadium yesterday, pil
ing up a convincing 24 to 10 vic
tory in a national professional
football opener.
More than 52,000 fans watched the
49ers come from behind after Cleve
land's Otto Graham passed to a
touchdown with the game only two
and one-half minutes old.
It was running Verle Lillywhite
that featured San Francisco's
sparkling effort. Lillywhite slanted
off tackle for important runs of 2.H,
20 and 33 yards to figure in plays
that set up the 49er scores.
Quarterback Frankie Albert, play
ing his sixth season with San Fran
cisco. was a superb general and added
to the 49ers' decisive victory by pass
ing to one touchdown.
Joe (Jet) Perry, the 49ers' speedy
negro fullback, spun to two scores,
driving over center on six-yard pay
off carries each time.
Gordon Soltau, San Francisco end
and placekicking specialist, put the
winners into the lead for the first time
just three seconds before the first half
ended when he booted a field goal
from the 43 yard line.
Graham, the Browns' passing ace,
became increasingly less effective
as (be game wore on. An aggress
ive liter line, inspired (o a great
performance today, charged
through Graham's protective screen
and kept bis aerials bottled up.
Graham's pass in the opening min
utes traveled nine yards. Long
legged Dub Jones, who took the
i rial alone in the right flat, raced
down the sidelines 73 yards for the
score.
Lou Groza. whose field goal in the
waning moments of a game won tlx
pro title for the Browns last year,
booted a three-pointer in the third
period. His kick traveled from the

40 yard line.
San Francisco, a doormat in the !
conference last season, became the
only team in football to win three |
games from Cleveland. The perennial i
champion Browns dropped two en- j
counters to San Francisco when the j
two teams operated in the now de
funct ail-American Conference.
