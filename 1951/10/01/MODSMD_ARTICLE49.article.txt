## Taylor: A Lot of Work Needed Before Michigan 
### PETE GROTHE 
Thirty - one - year - old Chuck
Taylor has only been in the
head coaching profession for
.wo games, but already he has
all the veterans beaten when it
monies to pulling out the crying
iowel.
In the dressing room after Stan
lord's 2G to 13 victory, Chuck sat
down on a low bench, ran one of hi:
big hands over his red hair, smiled
faintly, and let out his tale of woe
to the assemblage of reporters:
"Gentlemen, this week we need
a lot of work on offense and de
fense, and that takes in a lut.
Bron/.an played an extremely
good defense against us. He gam
hied, but it turned out well. Make
no mistake, that was a darn good
San Jose team out there.
"As is always the case, they were
really keyed up for us, whereas our
players didn't take them too seri
ously. Yes, sir, they made it rough
for us.
"1 can't see where we improved
from last week, except in fumbling.
This week we fumbled for a touch
down, which is something we didn't
do against Oregon."
Someone told Taylor that Mich
igan State hud trounced Michigan,
25 to 11. Instead of saying, "Oh,
good, that means we'll have a
nice chance to beat them next
week." Taylor pulled out the cry
ing towel again.
"Twenty-five to nothing! Whew!
That will make it tough oil us.
We'll be expected to win, and
they'll be after a comeback."
After the reporters had finished
dabbing their eyes, Taylor made
some observations on the brighter
side of the ledger: "I thought our
backs ran well. Bob Bryan has
started to show something. I liked
Hugasian's work, and Kerkorian's
touchdown run was excellent.
"All things considered, Kerkorian
and Garrett called excellent games.
Oh, yes, and McColl's touchdown
catch was tops. It really was."
Taylor further pointed out that

defen ive halfbacks Don Sanders j
and Have CasteUucci were very J
smooth, con.sii'ving that they are
only finsh. The aspect of (lu*
game that pleased Taylor the
most was that the Cards came
back the way the\ did after being
scored on fi'rst.
The Indian headman used 40 of ■
the 48 r.ien who suited up, and most!
'tern to feel that Stanford could
have piled up more of a scor e if "it
felt like leaving more of its fiivt
line troops in.
Ernie McCoy, Michigan scout, 1
said, "Stanford didn't look as good
today as against Oregon last week,
but. after all, these kids read the
papers too. They hear they're 25- or
40-point favorites, and they think
the game is already won.
"San Jose has plenty of talent to
offer, though I'm not trying to min
imize Stanford's efforts. Some of
the latter players, particularly Bry
an, impressed me."
San Jose's Bob Bronzan, only
one year Taylor's senior, was proud
that his team showed they had an
offense. He said that all three of bis
quarterbacks called good games and
saw weaknesses as they appeared
in the Stanford defense.
Taylor's conditioning program
paid off again, as the Indians es
caped for the second week in a
row without any damaging in
juries. Dick Horn suffered a
bruised leg, but trainer Connie
Jar vis said the injury was slight.
Horn, end Jack Rye, and tackle
Riiss Latham, who sat out Satur
day's game, will be ready for the
Wolverines.
For San Jose, fullback Bob Ama
ral received a knee hurt, tackle
Boots Edmonson twisted an ankle,
and half Gibby Mendonsa was
kicked in the head on the fourth
quarter onside kiekoff.
Some Spartan rabids came Fri
day night and burned a six-foot
"SJS" on the middle of the Stan
lord turf. Although San Jose lost
the game, it could go home smug
in the knowledge that it had de
faced Stanford's bautiful turf.

Ernie McCoy, Michigan scout, 1
said, "Stanford didn't look as good
today as against Oregon last week,
but. after all, these kids read the
papers too. They hear they're 25- or
40-point favorites, and they think
the game is already won.
"San Jose has plenty of talent to
offer, though I'm not trying to min
imize Stanford's efforts. Some of
the latter players, particularly Bry
an, impressed me."
San Jose's Bob Bronzan, only
one year Taylor's senior, was proud
that his team showed they had an
offense. He said that all three of bis
quarterbacks called good games and
saw weaknesses as they appeared
in the Stanford defense.
Taylor's conditioning program
paid off again, as the Indians es
caped for the second week in a
row without any damaging in
juries. Dick Horn suffered a
bruised leg, but trainer Connie
Jar vis said the injury was slight.
Horn, end Jack Rye, and tackle
Riiss Latham, who sat out Satur
day's game, will be ready for the
Wolverines.
For San Jose, fullback Bob Ama
ral received a knee hurt, tackle
Boots Edmonson twisted an ankle,
and half Gibby Mendonsa was
kicked in the head on the fourth
quarter onside kiekoff.
Some Spartan rabids came Fri
day night and burned a six-foot
"SJS" on the middle of the Stan
lord turf. Although San Jose lost
the game, it could go home smug
in the knowledge that it had de
faced Stanford's bautiful turf.
Thirty - one - year - old Chuck
Taylor has only been in the
head coaching profession for
.wo games, but already he has
all the veterans beaten when it
monies to pulling out the crying
iowel.
In the dressing room after Stan
lord's 2G to 13 victory, Chuck sat
down on a low bench, ran one of hi:
big hands over his red hair, smiled
faintly, and let out his tale of woe
to the assemblage of reporters:
"Gentlemen, this week we need
a lot of work on offense and de
fense, and that takes in a lut.
Bron/.an played an extremely
good defense against us. He gam
hied, but it turned out well. Make
no mistake, that was a darn good
San Jose team out there.
"As is always the case, they were
really keyed up for us, whereas our
players didn't take them too seri
ously. Yes, sir, they made it rough
for us.
"1 can't see where we improved
from last week, except in fumbling.
This week we fumbled for a touch
down, which is something we didn't
do against Oregon."
Someone told Taylor that Mich
igan State hud trounced Michigan,
25 to 11. Instead of saying, "Oh,
good, that means we'll have a
nice chance to beat them next
week." Taylor pulled out the cry
ing towel again.
"Twenty-five to nothing! Whew!
That will make it tough oil us.
We'll be expected to win, and
they'll be after a comeback."
After the reporters had finished
dabbing their eyes, Taylor made
some observations on the brighter
side of the ledger: "I thought our
backs ran well. Bob Bryan has
started to show something. I liked
Hugasian's work, and Kerkorian's
touchdown run was excellent.
"All things considered, Kerkorian
and Garrett called excellent games.
Oh, yes, and McColl's touchdown
catch was tops. It really was."
Taylor further pointed out that

defen ive halfbacks Don Sanders j
and Have CasteUucci were very J
smooth, con.sii'ving that they are
only finsh. The aspect of (lu*
game that pleased Taylor the
most was that the Cards came
