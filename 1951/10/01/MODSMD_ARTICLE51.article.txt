## 
### United Press 
In the most dramatic finish in
Daseball history, the Brooklyn
Dodgers and New York Giants
.ied for the National League Pen
nant yesterday and will meet in
the first of a best two out of three
game series at Ebbets Field to
day for the championship.
The winner will meet the Ameri
can League champion New York
Yankees in the first game of the
World Series at Yankee Stadium on
Thursday. It originally was sched
uled to open Wednesday but a day's
delay had been arranged in the
event of a tie in the National League
race.
Third Playoff
It was only the third time in his
tory that a playoff has been neces
sary to decide the pennant, and the
Dodgers have figured in two of
them. In the first, in 1940. the Dodg
ers lost to the Cardinals in two

straight. In the other—the only one
in American League history — the
Cleveland Indians beat the Boston
Red Sox in 1948.
Never has a pennant race seen
■ such tension-filled games as those
yesterday in which the Giants staved
off a last - minute Boston Brave
threat to win 3 to 2 at Braves Field
I while the battling Dodgers came
j from behind and beat the Phillies !)
jto 8 in 14 innings on a home run
I by Jackie Robinson.
Both games went clown to the
j final out under dramatic circum
stances.
The Braves had scored a run and
| had the tying run at second base
I and the winning run at first when
I Larry Jansen, the Giant hurler,
I bore down to get Willard Marshall
| for the final out.
Marshall, a former Giant who
would rather boat his old team
mates than eat, lilted an easy fly
ball to Monte Irvin in left field to
climax the greatest drive in base
ball history—one which saw the

Giants overcome a lSVa-game lead
which the Dodgers held on Aug. 11.
Looked Like Pennant
When that game ended, it looked
like the pennant for Leo Durocher's
never-say-i'ie Giants, for the Dodg
ers were trailing the Phillies 8 to 5
at that time. The Dodgers had
trailed 4-0 and 0-1 earlier in the
game.
Tne Giants were on the train
headed for home—they had waited
in their Braves Field Clubhouse
until the final minute—when the
Dodger;; came from behind with
three runs in the eighth to tie the
score.
The Dodgers then called on big
Don Newcombe, who had pitched
nine innings of scoreless ball, to
hold the Phillies at bay and he drew
as his opponent Robin Roberts, his
victim last night.
They battled through inning af
ter inning, each threatened often
but always with enough in reserve
to eiose the door.
The Phillies filled the bases wiih
only one out in the 12th, but New
combe bore down to get Del Ennis
on strikes and then Robinson made
a spectacular catch of Eddie Wait
kus' line drive to retire the side.
Newcombe Exhausted
Newcombe left in the 13th when,
| .iter retiring the first two men, he
i walked Andy Seminick and Rob

erts. He was so tired that manager
Charley Dressen of the Dodgers
took him out and put in Bud Pod
bielan, who had won only one t-anv.-
this season. He retired Ed Pella
grin! on a fly ball to retire the side.
With two out in the top of the
14th, Robinson lined his home run
into the upper left field bleachers
and that turned out to be it but not
until a last-minute scare by the
Phillies.
Richie Ashburn, who had been a
thorn in the side of the Dodgers all
day. led off with a single and was
sacrificed to second by Willie Jones
But Ennis and Waitkus flied out and
the Dodders had tied the Giants for
the pennant.

Thursday. It originally was sched
uled to open Wednesday but a day's
delay had been arranged in the
event of a tie in the National League
race.
Third Playoff
It was only the third time in his
tory that a playoff has been neces
sary to decide the pennant, and the
Dodgers have figured in two of
them. In the first, in 1940. the Dodg
ers lost to the Cardinals in two

straight. In the other—the only one
in American League history — the
Cleveland Indians beat the Boston
Red Sox in 1948.
Never has a pennant race seen
■ such tension-filled games as those
yesterday in which the Giants staved
off a last - minute Boston Brave
threat to win 3 to 2 at Braves Field
I while the battling Dodgers came
j from behind and beat the Phillies !)
jto 8 in 14 innings on a home run
I by Jackie Robinson.
Both games went clown to the
j final out under dramatic circum
stances.
The Braves had scored a run and
| had the tying run at second base
I and the winning run at first when
I Larry Jansen, the Giant hurler,
I bore down to get Willard Marshall
| for the final out.
Marshall, a former Giant who
would rather boat his old team
mates than eat, lilted an easy fly
ball to Monte Irvin in left field to
climax the greatest drive in base
ball history—one which saw the

Giants overcome a lSVa-game lead
which the Dodgers held on Aug. 11.
Looked Like Pennant
When that game ended, it looked
like the pennant for Leo Durocher's
never-say-i'ie Giants, for the Dodg
ers were trailing the Phillies 8 to 5
at that time. The Dodgers had
trailed 4-0 and 0-1 earlier in the
game.
Tne Giants were on the train
headed for home—they had waited
in their Braves Field Clubhouse
until the final minute—when the
Dodger;; came from behind with
three runs in the eighth to tie the
score.
The Dodgers then called on big
Don Newcombe, who had pitched
nine innings of scoreless ball, to
hold the Phillies at bay and he drew
as his opponent Robin Roberts, his
victim last night.
They battled through inning af
ter inning, each threatened often
but always with enough in reserve
to eiose the door.
The Phillies filled the bases wiih
only one out in the 12th, but New
combe bore down to get Del Ennis
on strikes and then Robinson made
a spectacular catch of Eddie Wait
kus' line drive to retire the side.
Newcombe Exhausted
Newcombe left in the 13th when,
| .iter retiring the first two men, he
i walked Andy Seminick and Rob

erts. He was so tired that manager
Charley Dressen of the Dodgers
took him out and put in Bud Pod
bielan, who had won only one t-anv.-
this season. He retired Ed Pella
grin! on a fly ball to retire the side.
With two out in the top of the
14th, Robinson lined his home run
into the upper left field bleachers
and that turned out to be it but not
until a last-minute scare by the
Phillies.
Richie Ashburn, who had been a
thorn in the side of the Dodgers all
day. led off with a single and was
sacrificed to second by Willie Jones
But Ennis and Waitkus flied out and
the Dodders had tied the Giants for
the pennant.
In the most dramatic finish in
Daseball history, the Brooklyn
Dodgers and New York Giants
.ied for the National League Pen
nant yesterday and will meet in
the first of a best two out of three
game series at Ebbets Field to
day for the championship.
The winner will meet the Ameri
