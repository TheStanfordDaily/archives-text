# KZSU Returns to Air Tonight; Sexy Sadie Will Distract Roughs
## Name of Mysterious Woman Kept Secret 
### 
Stanford Sadie, "The Loreli of
Stanford," returns to the airwaves
via KZSU, "880 on your radio dial"
tonight at 10:30. As usual, Sadie will
be attempting to lure Stanford roughs
away from their studies with her soft,
low. and sultry voice.
Traditionally Stanford Sadie re
mains a mystery woman until the
end of the quarter. At the beginning
of each term, a group on the KZSU
staff selects from the interested try
outees the girl who has the best voice
and delivery for filling the role of
Sadie.
After the choice is made, the iden
tity of Sadie goes under carefully
guarded wraps. Each Monday cloak
and dagger methods are used to slip
Sadie into the KZSU Studios unseen,
and the doors are barred against all
comers.
Only at the end of the quarter docs
Sadie reveal her true identity. She
then steps down from the position of
Stanford's most desirable woman, and
her place is open to another girl with
an appropriately sultry and sensuous
delivery.
