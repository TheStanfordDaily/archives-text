### 
FLUSHING, N.Y., Oct. 1 (UP)—
Tlic United Nations Security Coiin- i
ci! clashed Britain's hopes of obtain
ing a quick ruling on the Iranian oil
crisis tonight by postponing fur
ther action for 10 days to allow
Iranian Premier Mohammed Mos
sadegh time to fly here.
The postponement was granted j
the Iranians despite an appeal by
British Delegate Sir Gladwyn Jebb I
for action "within the next day or j
two"—in time to beat the Thursday j
deadline set by the Tehran govern- j
ment for evacuation of 300 British j
oil technicians from the Abadan re- j
finery.
Earlier, Russia had tried to block |
any UN consideration of the dispute
whatsoever on grounds that it is I
strictly an internal Iranian affair. I
The Soviet was voted down, 9-2,
however, with only Yugoslavia giv
ing support. In Washington, Am
bassador Vladimir Popovic said Yu- j
goslavia voted with Russia in the
belief that a negotiated settlement
between Britain and Iran still is \
possible.
Jebb, anxious to uphold the prin
ciple that the Iranian expulsion ul
timatum is a "flouting" of the inter
national court order barring seiz- J
urc of the Anglo-Iranian oil prop- j
cities, said the "urgency" of Council
action was not lessened by the Brit- j
ish decision to evacuate the tech- j
nicians before the Thursday zero J
hour.
