# Buss Tells of Visit to Korean Battlefront
## 
### 
Dr. Claude A. Buss, Stanford pro
fessor of history and former U.S.
diplomat, has had an opportunity to
visit Korea, he wrote friends at the
University.
Having spent the summer in Ja
pan taking part in seminars spon
sored jointly by Stanford Univer
sity and Tokyo National Univer
sity, Dr. Buss is now traveling in the
Far East under a Rockefeller Foun
dation travel grant.
Despite truce negotiations and i
perhaps hopes of an acceptable peace
agreement, ' the battle is still the ;
payoff in Korea," he wrote.
"The most important thing is still I
the armed forces, the fighting, the j
air sorties, the Navy bombardments, j
the reconnaissance patrols . . .
"This is genuinely a United Na- j
(ions effort. UN flans are all over '
I he plnre. Danish hospital ships
rtc in the harbor; a Swedish hos
pital unit has just completed its
first year in the field: a Greek
liaison office is one of the busiest
tents in the city (Pusan); British
and Dutch units have distin
guished themselves in the thick
of fVjhting; Asians — like Thais
and Filipinos—are in the thick of
it; and our massive American ef
fort is of course the backbone of I
the whole UN program.
"Mystifying initials — like UNAC
(United Nations Civil Assistance j
j Command); UNCURK (United Na-i
I tions Commission for Unification
(and Reconstruction of Korea); and!
UNKRA (United Nations Korean

Rehabilitation Agency)—never let
you forget that this is not just one
nation at work, it is all of us
through the UN.
"Korea has taken an awful beat
ing. Seoul is the latest edition of
the destruction of Berlin, Tokyo, or
Manila.
"The salvation stage of protecting
Korea against the aggressors has
been met; the restoration stage is
yet to come. In the eyes of Ko
reans naturally our good faith has
yet to be proved completely.
"As I looked out over the ruins
of Seoul, I coulfo't help thinking
of the small hov who was going to
'fix' a watch. There were all the
cogs, screws, and wheels in a tan
gled mess; now comes the job of
putting them together and mak
ing them run."
Dr. Buss will return to Stanford
in January to resume his teaching
and research duties.
