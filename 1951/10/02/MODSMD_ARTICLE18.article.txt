Student government at the Uni
versity of California at Los Ange
les was pitched into a political tur
moil last Wednesday night when the
vice - president, Ed Hummel, re
signed after charging that his work
"would be held of little value" by
others on the Student Council.
Though mentioning no specific
act which prompted his resignation,
Hummel did indicate in his letter of
resignation that he and other offi
cers had been at odds since his elec
tion last spring.
In electioneering Hummel had
carried on an unprecedented cam
paign that was reported in many
Southern California newspapers.
His election time activities were
characterized by torchlight parades,
banjo and song routines. As he
dressed as a girl, he was known as
"Edna" Hummel. Many student of
ficials believed Hummel was not in
terested in student affairs but in
boosting his reputation as a come
dian.
Formed Plans
Hummel, though admitting that
his campaign had been conducted in
the "spirit of fun only" and that no
serious outcome could be expected,
claimed that during the summer he
had thought the matter over and
had formed many plans "in the in
terest of the student body."
Among his plans were several for
arousing school spirit among enter
ing freshmen. One of his chief plans
called for the revived use of the
"dink."
The resignation was accepted by
vote of eight to one, with four
council members abstaining. It was
the first such resignation from stu
dent government affairs in UCLA's
history.
