# UN Warns Reds
## 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 2 — The
United Nations bluntly warned
Communist leaders by radio today
that "the time for bluffing is over"
in the Korean truce talks.
The Reds were told in a tough
talking "Voice of the United Na
tions Command" broadcast that
they must choose, and choose
quickly, between an "honorable ar
mistice" and all-out winter war.
"The United Nations is poised to
strike, and strike hard," the mes
sage from Gen. Matthew B. Ridg
way's headquarters command said—
if the Communists choose war in
stead of peace.
It was the second "gloves-off"
statement to the Communists since
Gen. Omar N. Bradley, chairman of
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, ar
rived in the Far East. Bradley said
on Saturday that the UN will not
listen to Communist demands that
the truce talks be resumed at Red
held Kaesong rather than a neutral
site recommended by Ridgvvay.
And today's plain-spoken notice
that the UN is ready to slug it out,
if that is what the Reds want, fol
lowed Gen. James A. Van Fleet's
thinly veiled threat of yesterday to
drive the Communist hordes all the
way back to the Yalu River, on the
Manchurian frontier, any time the
order is issued.
