### SALLY SHALER 
It's been 60 years since the first
extra - curricular activity was or
ganizcd at Stanford.
It was in 1891 that 110 women
students met in a basement room of
the History corner and established
the student YWCA here.
Stanford was one of the first West.
Coast colleges to organize such a
group, with the first "Y" having
been created 19 years earlier at fl
linois Normal College.
Large Group
The "Y," organized as a club "that
would awaken the minds and spirits
of the students who might later bo
come leaders in social, political, and
religious movements of the world,"
has grown since its Stanford incep
tion to one of the largest groups on
campus. Among the local "Y's"
contributions has been the rejuve
nation of the lIR and the establish
ment of Vocom and the Off-Campus
Women's Club.
The YWCA also plays a leading
role in the pre-reg program for new
students.
Among the former Stanford "Y"
members who arc si ill well known
by Stanfordites are Miss Ann Gu
thrie, for whom Guthrie House i.
named, and Miss Pat, now dirrlor
of Stern Hall.
National Affiliation
The campus "Y" is linked with
the National Student YWCA. It,
tcrnationally it is affiliated with the
World Student Christian Fedora
tion with students in 10 other coun
tries,
At the opening of the 1951 school
year the "Y" is planning to continue
its role of school and community
service as it continues its search for
"new areas of endeavor."
