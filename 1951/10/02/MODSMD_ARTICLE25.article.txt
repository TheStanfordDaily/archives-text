'Soyez le bienvenu," "Benvenuti," "Will
kom," and "Willkommen" add up to one inter
national hello for Stanford's seven newly ar
rived foreign scholarship students.
These students were chosen by the Foreign
Scholarship Committee for their outstanding
work and evidences of leadership in their re
spective colleges abroad. They are here at
Stanford to further the purpose behind the For
eign Scholarship Program—to promote world
understanding through an exchange of ideas.
An exchange of ideas sounds like a healthy
idea in this age of iron curtains, but it is one
that lacks meaning unless put into action.
Fortunately Stanford's program is designed
for bringing our foreign scholars into close con
tact with many students. By moving to differ

ent living groups each quarter, by talking to
various campus groups, and by participating in
campus activities . . . curricular and otherwise
. . . these students have a chance to absorb
and. understand our way of life, while we have
the opportunity to hear about theirs.
But probably the greatest exchange of ideas
will come over a cup of Cellar coffee, or
through a lively bull session in your dorm.
You'll hear what the students are thinking
about in France, what they're talking about in
Italy, v/hat classes are like at the Free Univer
sity of Berlin, what the social life is in Holland,
and if Switzerland really looks like all the
travel posters you've seen.
In all it should be a great and worthwhile
experience for you as well as for our students
from abroad.—S. G.
