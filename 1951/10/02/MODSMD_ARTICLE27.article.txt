### DICK McLEAN 
A FOREIGN STUDENT SEES lIIS FIRST
FOOTBALL GAME
The United States is the only country that plays
football as we know it. Other nations have a game
called lootball but it is closer to the American soccer.
So therefore, when foreign students come here and see
;i "football" game, they are often somtwhat mystified.
I asked a boy from Germany what he thought of his
first football game. His answer went something like
this:
"It was all a bit confusing but wonderful. My friends
tell me to wear a blue and white shirt in honor of the
opposing team. They say it is the custom in America.
It is a good cu-stom. Ja?
"Everybody in this country is so friendly. When
I go to sit in the Men's Shouting Section, everyone
yeHs and stamps his feet and chants something. Some
hoys in the spirit of fun take my shirt off and throw
it in the air. It was an old shirt anyway. Ach. you
Americans are so . . . how you say . . . lusty?
"I think I must have sat in the wrong seat because
the two boys on either side of me pick me up and hand
me to the two boys in front of us and thus on down.
They were all very polite and deposited me in a place
about nine rows below. Next week I read the number
on my ticket.
"The boy who makes everyone yell pointed across
the green and the Men's Shouting Section all stood up
and clapped. Our army was running out. It was won
derful. The orchestra plays and everyone cheers and
the- girls all wave their bonbons.
"Our side was dressed in red with large white hats.
Some of our army had cages built on extra in front
of their hats. My friend said that those cages were
muzzles to keep the especially ferocious ones from
biting.

"After much shouting, our army and the enemy army
go out on the green. A man in a zebra shirt gave our
general an egg-shaped ball. One of our men kicks the
ball. The enemy team played unfair. One of their men,
instead of kicking the ball, picked it up and tried to
run with it. This must have made our side very angry
because they all rushed down and knocked the offender
off his feet. I thought for a moment that there was
going to be a . . . how you say , . . rhubarb?
"All afternoon the two armies try to hide the egg
shaped ball from one another. They did a very fine
job. All the time I am watching one side of the green
when suddenly everyone shouts and there is a pile
of bodies on the other side. The ball is usually found
underneath the largest pile. When I was not watching
the battle on the green. I was watching the girls that
stand up and wave the bonbons at the other girls.
That is a fine American custom too.
"One time the enemy player runs all the way down
the green to where the derrick was placed. I thought
that this was especially brave of him and I stand up
and clap. 'Sportsmanship,' 1 tried to explain as the
boys changed my seats for me again. Ach, you Amer
ican!
"Finally, late in the afternoon, someone gets really
angry with someone else and shoots him. I did not
see which one was hit by the bullet because there
were so many people on the ground. I guess it is the
American custom to stop playing once somebody gets
shot. Then sadly everyone stands up and takes off
his hat and sings a hymn for those that died.
"Week after next I am going to the battle of Stan
ford against UCLA. My friends say that I should wear
a blue and gold shirt that week. What do you think?"
I started to explain, then stopped. "Why destroy
his illusions?" I thought. Illusions are sometimes fun.

A FOREIGN STUDENT SEES lIIS FIRST
FOOTBALL GAME
The United States is the only country that plays
football as we know it. Other nations have a game
called lootball but it is closer to the American soccer.
So therefore, when foreign students come here and see
;i "football" game, they are often somtwhat mystified.
I asked a boy from Germany what he thought of his
first football game. His answer went something like
this:
"It was all a bit confusing but wonderful. My friends
tell me to wear a blue and white shirt in honor of the
opposing team. They say it is the custom in America.
It is a good cu-stom. Ja?
"Everybody in this country is so friendly. When
I go to sit in the Men's Shouting Section, everyone
yeHs and stamps his feet and chants something. Some
hoys in the spirit of fun take my shirt off and throw
it in the air. It was an old shirt anyway. Ach. you
Americans are so . . . how you say . . . lusty?
"I think I must have sat in the wrong seat because
the two boys on either side of me pick me up and hand
me to the two boys in front of us and thus on down.
They were all very polite and deposited me in a place
about nine rows below. Next week I read the number
on my ticket.
"The boy who makes everyone yell pointed across
the green and the Men's Shouting Section all stood up
and clapped. Our army was running out. It was won
derful. The orchestra plays and everyone cheers and
the- girls all wave their bonbons.
"Our side was dressed in red with large white hats.
Some of our army had cages built on extra in front
of their hats. My friend said that those cages were
muzzles to keep the especially ferocious ones from
biting.

"After much shouting, our army and the enemy army
go out on the green. A man in a zebra shirt gave our
general an egg-shaped ball. One of our men kicks the
ball. The enemy team played unfair. One of their men,
instead of kicking the ball, picked it up and tried to
run with it. This must have made our side very angry
because they all rushed down and knocked the offender
off his feet. I thought for a moment that there was
going to be a . . . how you say , . . rhubarb?
"All afternoon the two armies try to hide the egg
shaped ball from one another. They did a very fine
job. All the time I am watching one side of the green
when suddenly everyone shouts and there is a pile
of bodies on the other side. The ball is usually found
underneath the largest pile. When I was not watching
the battle on the green. I was watching the girls that
stand up and wave the bonbons at the other girls.
That is a fine American custom too.
"One time the enemy player runs all the way down
the green to where the derrick was placed. I thought
that this was especially brave of him and I stand up
and clap. 'Sportsmanship,' 1 tried to explain as the
boys changed my seats for me again. Ach, you Amer
ican!
