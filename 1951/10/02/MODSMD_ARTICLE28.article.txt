## Webfeet Suffer Loss of Toll-Free Phones 
### 
University of Oregon students are disturbed over
something new which has been added to campus
living groups this year. All dorms were presented with
"nice. new. shiny pay phones," according to the Ore
gon Emerald. Some phones to be used for business only
will remain toll-free.
The way the Emerald puts it. "It's bad enough to
pay for your own phone calls. It's downright un
democratic when you have to pay for a call made in
the interest of another person."
Stanford students haven't felt quite that strongly.
At UCLA
UCLA students have found improvements in the
bookstore line problem. The solution—build a bigger
bookstore. The bookstore manager even gave an
award to demonstrate to the students the great num
bers handled by the store during the early part of
the semester. A juicy red apple was presented to the
"IOOOth person to enter the bookstore since the begin
ning of classes.
And at USC
At USC one student at least is not happy about the
Aii HO program. He decided thai an enlistment poster

on one of the campus bulletin boards did not tell
the full story. Originally it showed an Air HO cadet
standing on steps upon which were the words, "A
step lorward. Alter the word "forward" the student
filled in with "to Korea."
The Cavalier Daily at the University of Virginia is
in an uproar over a new system devised for efficiency
at their snack bar. Students now pay their bills before
seeing the menu. Even the bees would be up in arms
if this happened at the Cellar.
USC Again
Hack at USC again. Tommy Trojan has been the
victim of bulbsnatchers. The students wanted to be
sure to spot any would-be painters of their statute
trademark. After an electrician laboriously made the
necessary connections he discovered four of the six
spotlight bulbs missing. UCLA is suspected.
Eight local theater managers are high on the popu
larity list with Cal students. When they bought this
fall's ASUC cards they were entitled to buy a 50 cent
ticket good lor an average 20 cent price reduction at
the theaters. 5.990 of the 9,351 ASUC card purchasers
to date have taken advantage of the offer.
