## Punts and Pitches Have Cards Chance for Roses? 
### 
And now we come to the star question of questions, the query as large
as the Miiky Way and the Andromeda Nebulae . . . What will Stanford's
football team do this year?
Not much, says Brother Odell, who's trying to find a buyer for his Rose
IJowl tie. Not much, says Hal Wood, United Press sports editor. Wood,
who weighs all of 115 pounds dripping wet calls Stanford a "weakling."
Not much, say the San Francisco sport scribes. Not much, say the national
experts.
Apparently, Stanford's stock is lower than the guys who had §(i,OOO of
marijuana upweeded, and nothing could he more ideal. Let's review the
situation at this time last vear. The Indians had racked up San Jose by
a comfortable margin, and L'Sl-' had been mutilated 55 to 7. Look, Ma, no
hands.
Everyone and his brother Zeke were whispering pleasantries about Stan
foul, and the Indians were a hot bet for the Rose Howl. Then, of courss,
tile roof caved in. This year finds the Cardinals in a more favorable position.
Oil the San Jose and Oregon showings, no one expects Stanford to do any
thing, and in this way no one can be disappointed.
The point we would like to offer is that the Reds are better than their
afternoon bouts with the Ducks and the Spartans would seem to indicate.
Before the season we asked Dink Templetcn what Stanford's chances of
going to the Rose Bowl were. Dink, one of the dryest wits in the business,
remarked, "50-50." When we questioned what 50-50 meant, he said "50
per cent chance that we win the Rose Bowl, 50 per cent chance that we
lose it." In short, Dink automatically had us in the Rose Bowl.
We don't know if Dink would say the same thing now, but he did make
this observation after the San Jose State game. "Stanford looked listless
and uninspired, but their mistakes weren't mistakes that can't be corrected.
Their main fault was that they weren't quick enough on their initial line
charge, and that is something that can be worked out."
Ofl their San Jose showing, the Indians should lose to Michigan, UCLA,
Southern Cal, Washington, and Cal. But its our strong conviction that
Stanford is much better than their San Jose showing.
The Indians have the potential, and to bring out that potential is one of
the ablest coaching staffs in the nation. Anyone who watches the grid tutors
in action can testify to that. Unlike previous years, no one is standing around.
Every minute is carefully planned for every gridder. Chuck Taylor works
from eight in the morning to 10 p.m. in organization and planning. Joe
Kuetz, former head coach at St. Mary's, and George Lynn, the backfield
coach with the tooth-paste add smile, are invaluable additions to the staff.
Dutch Fehring is brilliant and thorough and pepper-pot Pete Kmetovic never
stops moving.
As far as personnel is concerned. Stanford has the best ends, guards, and
quarterbacks in the league. Bill McColl is the best offensive end in America
and Jack Rye the best defensive end on the coast. Also include Bill Storum,
who has the speed to get down for the long ones, John Steinberg, Sam
Morley, Ron Eadie, and Marv Tennefoss.
Where in the PCC can you find a better squadron of guards than Jess
Cone, Leon King. Norm Manoogian. Jack Bonetti. Ilart Cook, Owen Powell,
Hob Griffin, and Phil Wilson? And where else in the nation do you find
an offensive quarterback of Dick Horn's stature playing defense?
Look for some startling things from Stanford's halfbacks this year. People
say that Harry Hugasian is the Hugasian of old. He's the same Hugasian he
always was, but this season he has blocking. People forget that in his sopho
more year, one long-gone Emery Mitchell blocked for the Hipster, and that
made a difference. Last year, Harry had to make his own holes . . . this
year he doesn't.
Bobby Bryan showed that he will give Stanford the speed it lacks, and
Ron Cook is the hardest running sophomore back since Boyd Benson. High
stepping Eric Southwood is murder, once past the line of scrimmage.
Well-proportioned Bob Meyers is one of the classiest ball-carriers in the
league and Skip Crist will give valuable assistance. The Skipper is a lot
faster than last year. Also look for clean-limbed Bob Mathias to throw off
his leg injury and dazzle the opponents on end runs and screen passes before
the season is out.
True. Stanford should not be favored for the Rose Bowl, especially
after the first two games. But the personnel is capable of getting to Pasa
dena. come New Years day. And tell your mother to get the coon skin
coat, the uke. and the Stanford pennant out of mothballs.
Just in case.

Well-proportioned Bob Meyers is one of the classiest ball-carriers in the
league and Skip Crist will give valuable assistance. The Skipper is a lot
faster than last year. Also look for clean-limbed Bob Mathias to throw off
his leg injury and dazzle the opponents on end runs and screen passes before
the season is out.
True. Stanford should not be favored for the Rose Bowl, especially
after the first two games. But the personnel is capable of getting to Pasa
dena. come New Years day. And tell your mother to get the coon skin
coat, the uke. and the Stanford pennant out of mothballs.
Just in case.
And now we come to the star question of questions, the query as large
as the Miiky Way and the Andromeda Nebulae . . . What will Stanford's
football team do this year?
Not much, says Brother Odell, who's trying to find a buyer for his Rose
IJowl tie. Not much, says Hal Wood, United Press sports editor. Wood,
who weighs all of 115 pounds dripping wet calls Stanford a "weakling."
Not much, say the San Francisco sport scribes. Not much, say the national
experts.
Apparently, Stanford's stock is lower than the guys who had §(i,OOO of
marijuana upweeded, and nothing could he more ideal. Let's review the
situation at this time last vear. The Indians had racked up San Jose by
a comfortable margin, and L'Sl-' had been mutilated 55 to 7. Look, Ma, no
hands.
Everyone and his brother Zeke were whispering pleasantries about Stan
foul, and the Indians were a hot bet for the Rose Howl. Then, of courss,
tile roof caved in. This year finds the Cardinals in a more favorable position.
Oil the San Jose and Oregon showings, no one expects Stanford to do any
thing, and in this way no one can be disappointed.
The point we would like to offer is that the Reds are better than their
afternoon bouts with the Ducks and the Spartans would seem to indicate.
Before the season we asked Dink Templetcn what Stanford's chances of
going to the Rose Bowl were. Dink, one of the dryest wits in the business,
remarked, "50-50." When we questioned what 50-50 meant, he said "50
per cent chance that we win the Rose Bowl, 50 per cent chance that we
lose it." In short, Dink automatically had us in the Rose Bowl.
We don't know if Dink would say the same thing now, but he did make
this observation after the San Jose State game. "Stanford looked listless
and uninspired, but their mistakes weren't mistakes that can't be corrected.
Their main fault was that they weren't quick enough on their initial line
charge, and that is something that can be worked out."
Ofl their San Jose showing, the Indians should lose to Michigan, UCLA,
Southern Cal, Washington, and Cal. But its our strong conviction that
Stanford is much better than their San Jose showing.
The Indians have the potential, and to bring out that potential is one of
the ablest coaching staffs in the nation. Anyone who watches the grid tutors
in action can testify to that. Unlike previous years, no one is standing around.
Every minute is carefully planned for every gridder. Chuck Taylor works
from eight in the morning to 10 p.m. in organization and planning. Joe
Kuetz, former head coach at St. Mary's, and George Lynn, the backfield
coach with the tooth-paste add smile, are invaluable additions to the staff.
Dutch Fehring is brilliant and thorough and pepper-pot Pete Kmetovic never
stops moving.
As far as personnel is concerned. Stanford has the best ends, guards, and
quarterbacks in the league. Bill McColl is the best offensive end in America
and Jack Rye the best defensive end on the coast. Also include Bill Storum,
who has the speed to get down for the long ones, John Steinberg, Sam
Morley, Ron Eadie, and Marv Tennefoss.
Where in the PCC can you find a better squadron of guards than Jess
Cone, Leon King. Norm Manoogian. Jack Bonetti. Ilart Cook, Owen Powell,
Hob Griffin, and Phil Wilson? And where else in the nation do you find
an offensive quarterback of Dick Horn's stature playing defense?
Look for some startling things from Stanford's halfbacks this year. People
say that Harry Hugasian is the Hugasian of old. He's the same Hugasian he
always was, but this season he has blocking. People forget that in his sopho
more year, one long-gone Emery Mitchell blocked for the Hipster, and that
made a difference. Last year, Harry had to make his own holes . . . this
year he doesn't.
Bobby Bryan showed that he will give Stanford the speed it lacks, and
Ron Cook is the hardest running sophomore back since Boyd Benson. High
stepping Eric Southwood is murder, once past the line of scrimmage.
Well-proportioned Bob Meyers is one of the classiest ball-carriers in the

Look for some startling things from Stanford's halfbacks this year. People
say that Harry Hugasian is the Hugasian of old. He's the same Hugasian he
always was, but this season he has blocking. People forget that in his sopho
more year, one long-gone Emery Mitchell blocked for the Hipster, and that
made a difference. Last year, Harry had to make his own holes . . . this
year he doesn't.
Bobby Bryan showed that he will give Stanford the speed it lacks, and
Ron Cook is the hardest running sophomore back since Boyd Benson. High
stepping Eric Southwood is murder, once past the line of scrimmage.
Well-proportioned Bob Meyers is one of the classiest ball-carriers in the
league and Skip Crist will give valuable assistance. The Skipper is a lot
faster than last year. Also look for clean-limbed Bob Mathias to throw off
his leg injury and dazzle the opponents on end runs and screen passes before
the season is out.
True. Stanford should not be favored for the Rose Bowl, especially
after the first two games. But the personnel is capable of getting to Pasa
dena. come New Years day. And tell your mother to get the coon skin
coat, the uke. and the Stanford pennant out of mothballs.
Just in case.
And now we come to the star question of questions, the query as large
as the Miiky Way and the Andromeda Nebulae . . . What will Stanford's
football team do this year?
Not much, says Brother Odell, who's trying to find a buyer for his Rose
IJowl tie. Not much, says Hal Wood, United Press sports editor. Wood,
who weighs all of 115 pounds dripping wet calls Stanford a "weakling."
Not much, say the San Francisco sport scribes. Not much, say the national
experts.
Apparently, Stanford's stock is lower than the guys who had §(i,OOO of
marijuana upweeded, and nothing could he more ideal. Let's review the
situation at this time last vear. The Indians had racked up San Jose by
a comfortable margin, and L'Sl-' had been mutilated 55 to 7. Look, Ma, no
hands.
Everyone and his brother Zeke were whispering pleasantries about Stan
foul, and the Indians were a hot bet for the Rose Howl. Then, of courss,
tile roof caved in. This year finds the Cardinals in a more favorable position.
Oil the San Jose and Oregon showings, no one expects Stanford to do any
thing, and in this way no one can be disappointed.
The point we would like to offer is that the Reds are better than their
afternoon bouts with the Ducks and the Spartans would seem to indicate.
Before the season we asked Dink Templetcn what Stanford's chances of
going to the Rose Bowl were. Dink, one of the dryest wits in the business,
remarked, "50-50." When we questioned what 50-50 meant, he said "50
per cent chance that we win the Rose Bowl, 50 per cent chance that we
lose it." In short, Dink automatically had us in the Rose Bowl.
We don't know if Dink would say the same thing now, but he did make
this observation after the San Jose State game. "Stanford looked listless
and uninspired, but their mistakes weren't mistakes that can't be corrected.
Their main fault was that they weren't quick enough on their initial line
charge, and that is something that can be worked out."
Ofl their San Jose showing, the Indians should lose to Michigan, UCLA,
Southern Cal, Washington, and Cal. But its our strong conviction that
Stanford is much better than their San Jose showing.
The Indians have the potential, and to bring out that potential is one of
the ablest coaching staffs in the nation. Anyone who watches the grid tutors
in action can testify to that. Unlike previous years, no one is standing around.
Every minute is carefully planned for every gridder. Chuck Taylor works
from eight in the morning to 10 p.m. in organization and planning. Joe
Kuetz, former head coach at St. Mary's, and George Lynn, the backfield
coach with the tooth-paste add smile, are invaluable additions to the staff.
Dutch Fehring is brilliant and thorough and pepper-pot Pete Kmetovic never
stops moving.
As far as personnel is concerned. Stanford has the best ends, guards, and
quarterbacks in the league. Bill McColl is the best offensive end in America
and Jack Rye the best defensive end on the coast. Also include Bill Storum,
who has the speed to get down for the long ones, John Steinberg, Sam
Morley, Ron Eadie, and Marv Tennefoss.
Where in the PCC can you find a better squadron of guards than Jess
Cone, Leon King. Norm Manoogian. Jack Bonetti. Ilart Cook, Owen Powell,
Hob Griffin, and Phil Wilson? And where else in the nation do you find
an offensive quarterback of Dick Horn's stature playing defense?
