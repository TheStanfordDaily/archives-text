# Czech 'Iron Horse'

### 
WASHINGTON â€” The United
States today flatly rejected a de
mand from Czechoslovakia that it
hand over the runaway Czech com
muters who drove an "iron horse"
through the Iron Curtain in a dar
ing ride to freedom.
The U.S. said it will return the
purloined passenger train, but no
more. All the Czech citizens who
want to remain in the U.S. zone of
Germany will be granted "political
asylum," it said.
There were 111 startled passen
gers on the train that engineer Fra
zek Jarda highballed past a border
blockade into Germany Sept. 11.
