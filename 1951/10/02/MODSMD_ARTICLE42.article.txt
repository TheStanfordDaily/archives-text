# Water Polo Team to Open Season Against Cal Saturday
## 
### JIM MADISON 
With prospects for the year exceedingly bright, practices of j
Stanford's varsity water polo team are reaching the intense stage
in preparation for Saturday's opener with California at Berkeley. !
Coach Tom Haynie has lost only two regulars, forward Irwin 1
Johnson and guard Ernie Polte, from last year's squad which

shared the PCC southern division
title with USC. Johnson joined the
Navy during the summer, and Polte
graduated.
Returning are six first-string let
termen, headed by high - scoring
center forward Bob Frojen, and a
number of f>osh and transfer rein
forcements.
Starting Lineup
In addition to Frojen, Haynie has
lined up a tentative starting lineup
of Bob Wycoff and Al Kidder at
forwards, Bert Holiday and Mel
Butler at guards, and Ash Jones
playing center back. All these men j
are returning lettermen.
Jim Gaughram, one of two high
scoring forwards named Jim on last 1
year's undefeated frosh t«im, ranks i
light behind this opening contin- j
gent and is fighting hard for a berth
on it. The other Jim, Jim Lee, is !
lost to the squad this season for
scholastic reasons, but would have
been a probable regular.
Transfers Should Help
Haynie is counting on one trans
fer to furnish lots of help. George
Kroeger is the lad's name, and he
i played two years at Fullerton JC,
! which has also furnished Stanford
such players as Frojen and Polte.
Hernia operations • present the
| only injury problems to the squad
I at present. Dan Osborne, a frosh
who was highly touted, is out for
the season while recovering from a
hernia operation; and Russ La-
Telle, last season's leading goalie, is
scheduled to undergo the knife to
repair a hernia difficulty of long
standing, but recent discovery.
Working on Plays
In LaTelle's absence Steve Ben
nett, a veteran of last year, and
I Andy DeBaubigny, who played as a
frosh but sat out last season, are

vying for the goalie duties.
Scrimmages, which comprise the
major part of the practice at pres
ent, are developing a series of plays
designed to spring Frojen. who has
been a high scorer for the Cards
for the last two years as well as
pumping in the goals for Whittier's
national ranking AAU squad, loose
for scoring atter/!£)ts.
The Fullerton boy, who possesses
a powerful right arm, has been
whipping them in with almost mo
notonous regularity in practice.

I at present. Dan Osborne, a frosh
who was highly touted, is out for
the season while recovering from a
hernia operation; and Russ La-
Telle, last season's leading goalie, is
scheduled to undergo the knife to
repair a hernia difficulty of long
standing, but recent discovery.
Working on Plays
In LaTelle's absence Steve Ben
nett, a veteran of last year, and
I Andy DeBaubigny, who played as a
frosh but sat out last season, are

vying for the goalie duties.
Scrimmages, which comprise the
major part of the practice at pres
ent, are developing a series of plays
designed to spring Frojen. who has
been a high scorer for the Cards
for the last two years as well as
pumping in the goals for Whittier's
national ranking AAU squad, loose
for scoring atter/!£)ts.
The Fullerton boy, who possesses
a powerful right arm, has been
whipping them in with almost mo
notonous regularity in practice.
With prospects for the year exceedingly bright, practices of j
Stanford's varsity water polo team are reaching the intense stage
in preparation for Saturday's opener with California at Berkeley. !
Coach Tom Haynie has lost only two regulars, forward Irwin 1
Johnson and guard Ernie Polte, from last year's squad which

shared the PCC southern division
title with USC. Johnson joined the
Navy during the summer, and Polte
graduated.
Returning are six first-string let
termen, headed by high - scoring
center forward Bob Frojen, and a
number of f>osh and transfer rein
forcements.
Starting Lineup
In addition to Frojen, Haynie has
lined up a tentative starting lineup
of Bob Wycoff and Al Kidder at
forwards, Bert Holiday and Mel
Butler at guards, and Ash Jones
playing center back. All these men j
are returning lettermen.
Jim Gaughram, one of two high
scoring forwards named Jim on last 1
year's undefeated frosh t«im, ranks i
light behind this opening contin- j
gent and is fighting hard for a berth
on it. The other Jim, Jim Lee, is !
lost to the squad this season for
scholastic reasons, but would have
been a probable regular.
Transfers Should Help
Haynie is counting on one trans
fer to furnish lots of help. George
Kroeger is the lad's name, and he
i played two years at Fullerton JC,
! which has also furnished Stanford
such players as Frojen and Polte.
