# N.Y. Beats Bums, 3-1
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Money hurler Jim Hearn pitched
the New York Giants to a 3 to 1 vie- i
tory against the Brooklyn Dodgers
yesterday in their two out of three !
playoff series for the National League
flag. The winner oi the all-important j
all-out series meets the New York
Yankees, American League champs
! in the World Series starting Thurs- j
day.
Bobby Thomson and Monte Irvin ;
both hit home runs to give the Giants
enough to edge the ever slipping j
Dodgers.
It was a pleading, prayerful Ebbetts
Field throng of .'J0,707 that saw their i
beloved Bums bow to the hated rival
Giants under ex-Dodger L.-o Duro
cher who apparently won't be denied
in the most amazing comeback in
I baseball history.
Hearn who allowed only five hits
I was given a lead that he never re
i linquished in the fourth inning.
Ralph Branca, Brooklyn pitching
choice to stop the surging Giants, got
in trouble when he nicked Irvin on
the elbow giving him a free stroll to
I first base. It was only moments later
| that Thomson drove a Branca fast !
ball deep into the lower left field seats \
to score two runs. The cake's icing '
was put on in the eighth when Irving
j hit for the circuit with no one on
i base.
Hearn allowed only five hits, to the j
j now silent Dodger bats, one a home
j run by Andy Pafko in the second '
j inning to give the Dodgers a short !
lived, one to nothing advantage,
j Hearn pitched hitless ball for the last
i four and a half frames.
Today's second game and possibly
| the last, if the Giants take it, will be
played across town at the Polo
Grounds where fans screaming like
monkeys with red pepper in their
peanuts will greet their now beloved j
Giants who have taken the last 3S) out
of 45 ball games.
