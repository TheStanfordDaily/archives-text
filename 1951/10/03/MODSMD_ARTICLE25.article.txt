# Testing Center Aids Students

### SUE WHEAT 
"What should my major be?
Why do I consistently get C's?
How can I use my time to better
advantage? What will I do after
graduation?"
These arc the questions which I
have always plagued the student. I
And right here on the Inner Quad
of Stanford University is a group
of specialists whose sole job it is to |
give him the answers.
These specialists, under the direc
tion of Dr. John D. Black, make up
the Counseling and Testing Center.
Last year 806 Stanford students
came to th* center where they un
derwent 2,190 interviews and took
2,71'0 tests.
The center operates on two main
premises:
I. Discoveries in the science of
psychology have made possible,
through counseling ami testing,
the solution of problems which
have hitherto gone unanswered.
2. Part of the process of educa- |
tion is intimate intellectual contact j
with adults which students now j
miss in the modern college class
i oom.
To help the student to solve his j
problems, and in so doing give him (
the personal attention neglected in [
large classes, is then the twofold I
purpose of the Counseling and J
Testing Center. ,
Some students have poor study I
habits: they waste time, take sloppy
notes, read slowly, and have trouble
concentrating. Their improvement
can come through what the Center
calls the "Study Skills Clinic."
Two hundred twenty students en
rolled in the clinic last year.
They were organized into small
groups, met three hours a week,
and held individual conferences
with counselors and instructors.
"Anyone can increase his reading

speed several hundred words per
minute," Dr. Illack commented.
And on the basis of this, the elinir
could !><■ handling many more

students than it is.
Whether n student is truly dis
turbed or merely curious about
What vocational interest he should

foster, the Testing Center can han
dle him.
Drawing from a stock of some 55
standardized tests ,the student can
he analyzed in subjects ranging
from foreign language to finger tool
dexterity. Their titles include Ap
titudc, Inventory, Adjustment,
Skills, Placement, and Achieve
ment.
The service was originally set up
by the government after the war
as a Veterans' Guidance Center, ll
was run at federal expense (cost:
approximately $25 per veteran), but
in July, 1050, the Veterans' Center
was discontinued.
At that time the Univrr. ity took
over the management and the cost
of the service, converting il to stu
dent needs . It offers free to enrolled
students services which would else
where cost them up to $40 and $50.
The Center did not actually
suing into full operation until
January, 1051. and will probably
handle well over 1,000 this year
as compared to KO(5 for last.
Often seniors come into tho office
wanting information about specific
companies, especially before ap
pearing before them for an inter
view. They are shown to a voca
tional reading room where there arc
over 5,000 books and pamphlets do
seribing 3,000 different occupations.
Rlnck claims that "Vocational
indecision is many times iust a
lack of information about jobs."
This information the reading
room provides. It is open always
to all students, including tho e
who are not making use of the
center's counseling service.
Using the Testing Center is not a
matter of being 2tcrribly confused,
suddenly getting "the word," and
then setting a straight path lo a
clear goal.
ll IS a matter of obtaining con
crete help to do some formulative
thinking about the future

Some students have poor study I

can come through what the Center
calls the "Study Skills Clinic."
Two hundred twenty students en

They were organized into small

The service was originally set up

was run at federal expense (cost:
approximately $25 per veteran), but
