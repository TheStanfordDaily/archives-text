# Congress Passes Record Arms Bill

### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 2 (UP) —
Senate-House conferees today ap
proved a $57,200,000 military spend
ing hill — largest in U.S. peacetime
history—but agreed to slash a special
$5 billion air expansion fund to $1
billion.
The record military measure,
carrying funds for the army, navy
and air force for the 12 months end
ing next June 30, is slightly less than
the sum President Truman requested.
The record peacetime bill does not
include combat costs of the Korean
war, for which Congress will be
asked to appropriate additional sums
next year. Congressional experts
have estimated that the administra
tion will request another $8 billion
during the current fiscal year.
