# Dr. Isaacs, Series Speaker, Cites Work of Dramatists
## 'Contemporary British Theater' Opens 1951-52 Tuesday Lectures 
### 
Men like Christopher Fry, who "writes the English of England,"
may be the salvation of the contemporary British theater, accord
ing to Dr. Jacob Isaacs, in the opening lecture of the fall quarter
Tuesday Evening Series last night in Memorial Hall.
Dr. Isaacs, visiting the United States as a guest of the State

I Department, deplored the "hang
-1 over" from which the British stagf*
I has been suffering for the past 300
years. Ho suggested that formerly
a decline in royal patronage and
currently a rise in the price of seats
arc partly responsible.
Fry and Flint
In spite of his discouraging intro
ductory remarks, the major part of
Dr. Isaacs' talk was optimistic. "The
word," he said, remains still thr
most important feature of drama,
i especially poetic drama.
"Fry and T. S. Eliot are trying to
; transcend commercial theater," he
continued, by dominating the audi
ence with complete comprehension
of the "rhythms of local speech."
They have been successful, he add
ed, in recovering "something that,
almost went out of the theater."
British Radio
For the modern audience the old
Greek choruses are the "mayon
naise on the salad" and not the mu
sic they originally stood for. The
music of dramatic poetry, however,
he continued, cannit be left out
|of present - day productions even
though in a different form.
The great strides made in British
radio have helped improve the state
of British drama, Dr. Isaacs said.
He cited examples of radio produc
tions of the whole of the "Canter
bury Tales," a three-and-one-half
hour "Hamlet," and a radio ver
| sion of Vergil's "Aeneid."
"TV has not yet been able to
bludgeon" the 20 million British
â–  radio listeners, he said.
