# Library Vandalism
## 
### 
A particularly unpleasant campus character is
the "clipper." You've run across his work be
lore, especially in phone booths. He's the per
son who clips the "Stanford" page out of the
local phone book. This gives him a handy ref
erence but leaves everyone else with a use
less phone book and a bad temper.
Unfortunately the "clipper" also works in
libraries. Here he causes not only bad tem
pers but extensive destruction to valuable
property. A picture of his work is below.
The Stanford library reference room, for in
stance, estimates that 48-68 books are mutilated
each year by book users. This is just one room
in the library. Many books iaken from the
stacks are damaged, while many periodicals
are mutilated each year. This is in addition to
the comparatively large number of books not
returned (stolen). Not a pretty picture for a
mature community like Stanford.
The "clipper" isn't too dumb. He generally
does a smooth job, a page here, a paragraph
there. The books look the same on the outside,
but inside is an incomplete and often useless
mass of pages.
Usually the missing sections are not noticed

until some student flips over from page 75 to
what should be 76, but discovers instead that
he is on page 87. This is where the bad
tempers and wasted time come in. The li
brary can repair damage in many cases by a
photo process, but this is expensive and time
consuming.
Library officials say that students usually clip
pages or paragraphs in order to copy them at
leisure for papers. At the University of Cali
fornia a student once clipped out several pages
and pictures from a valuable book and casually
pasted them directly onto a term paper. He was
caught, but he was the exception to the rule.
Stanford Library director Raynard C. Swank
doesn't care about catching offenders. "We
just want to save our books from such need
less destruction," he says. Swank pointed
out that mutilating books was selfish and
hard on other students. Also it is a case of
outright destruction of property and is a viola
tion oi the California State Penal Code.
At Stanford it is a violation of the Funda
mental Standard, which should enough
in itself.


BOOKS MUTILATED—At left is shown a small library book of plays twisted and torn apart.
At right, near thumb on hand are shown two holes in a page of a Russian History book. The
holes were caused by some student tearing out paragraphs for reference. These two books are
examples of library vandalism.

At right, near thumb on hand are shown two holes in a page of a Russian History book. The
holes were caused by some student tearing out paragraphs for reference. These two books are
examples of library vandalism.
A particularly unpleasant campus character is
the "clipper." You've run across his work be
lore, especially in phone booths. He's the per
son who clips the "Stanford" page out of the
local phone book. This gives him a handy ref
erence but leaves everyone else with a use
less phone book and a bad temper.
Unfortunately the "clipper" also works in
libraries. Here he causes not only bad tem
pers but extensive destruction to valuable
property. A picture of his work is below.
The Stanford library reference room, for in
stance, estimates that 48-68 books are mutilated
each year by book users. This is just one room
in the library. Many books iaken from the
stacks are damaged, while many periodicals
are mutilated each year. This is in addition to
the comparatively large number of books not
returned (stolen). Not a pretty picture for a
mature community like Stanford.
The "clipper" isn't too dumb. He generally
does a smooth job, a page here, a paragraph
there. The books look the same on the outside,
but inside is an incomplete and often useless
mass of pages.
Usually the missing sections are not noticed

until some student flips over from page 75 to
what should be 76, but discovers instead that
he is on page 87. This is where the bad
tempers and wasted time come in. The li
brary can repair damage in many cases by a
photo process, but this is expensive and time
consuming.
Library officials say that students usually clip
pages or paragraphs in order to copy them at
leisure for papers. At the University of Cali
fornia a student once clipped out several pages
and pictures from a valuable book and casually
pasted them directly onto a term paper. He was
caught, but he was the exception to the rule.
Stanford Library director Raynard C. Swank
doesn't care about catching offenders. "We
just want to save our books from such need
less destruction," he says. Swank pointed
out that mutilating books was selfish and
hard on other students. Also it is a case of
outright destruction of property and is a viola
tion oi the California State Penal Code.
At Stanford it is a violation of the Funda
mental Standard, which should enough
in itself.
