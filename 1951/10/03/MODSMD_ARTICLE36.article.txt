II you should come on campus in 1954. things will be
different. It might surprise you.
Let's say that you get a three day furlough from what
ever branch of the service where you were "needed."
You drive by Eneina to see a buddy. The last thing
you heard, he was a sponsor there. As you walk up
the path, you think you hear a noise from one of the
third story windows. It sounds just like the squeal
of feminine laughter. You say to yourself, "Either I'm
(.racking up or the freshman boys are getting pretty
damn bold-*-in the afternoon at that." You shrug your
.shoulders and decide it just can't be.
You boom up the front steps and start upstairs
to the second floor. Two lovely girls meet you on
I heir way down. You pass one another quizzically,
liv then your mind is really spinning. Suddenly a
ray haired old ladv darts out of a doorway with
a cross body block.
"Young man, what exactly is the idea?" she booms
as you get to your feet.
"I'm just looking for a buddy, ma'am. His name is
"His name? No boys live here. This is a girls'
residence."
' Eneina? A girl's residence, but . . . ," you stammer.
Then the kindly, gray haired half back begins to
( buckle and explains. "Things have changed a wee
hit since . . ."
"You'll probably find him over at Ruble Hall.
That's where we keep them."
"Who, ma'am?"
"The men," she Jeers.
As you stumble out of the foyer you notice that
: omeone has painted it a baby blue with a shot of
chartreuse.
On the way over to Roble you see nothing but
beautiful girls. Tall ones, slim ones, blonds, brunettes,
redheads. "Real Stanford beauties!' you exclaim and
then roll the unfamiliar phrase ovei and over on your
tongue like a strange food. As you walk along you
have an odd feeling as if a hundred eyes ore watching
you—devouring you. About the post office you begin
to run.
V«ni arrive at Roble breathless, your mind a jum
ble. The lobby is full of girls. More Stanford beau
ties. You figure that the old lady was crazv about

men living at Roble. All you want to do by then is
find some nice shade tree and cut out paper dolls
and meditate.
But then you spy a familiar face. It's your buddy.
You weep from confused joy.
"Come on up to my room," he invites as he points
up toward second floor.
You feel as if you're defiling a sacred shrine as you
climb the steps to enter the holy of holies—second
floor at Roble.
You deposit yourself in his luxurious sitting room
with adjoining bath.
"Well, how's the army treating you, boy?" he be
gins. Before you can answer, the telephone rings.
"No. I'm sorry," he begins. "I'm busy tonight. . . .
No. I won't go out with you tonight ... I don't care
if you are a Chappie queen. Please stop bothering me."
He hangs up.
In the "Old Days" your buddy considered himself
lucky to have one date a month. He's not the hand
somest guy in the world either. Your startled open
mouth demands an explanation.
"Oh, things have changed," he laughs. "Haven't you
heard? Let me brief you. First, the ratio is 50 to 1.
That's why all the men are here. The rest of the
campus is all women. Those girls you saw in the
lobby were callers. Everything is Sadie Hawkins style
now. I can't remember when the last time was that
I asked a girl out or paid for a date. Was it last Spring
Quarter or was it Winter Quarter . . . ? Oh. inci
dentally I'm captain of the football team."
You look at his 131 pounds and wonder.
"Competition wasn't too tough." he admits. "I was
going out for boxing too until women's council out
lawed it as a danger to the ratio."
"How are the studies coming?" you ask. Your buddy
was always against the academic ropes in the old days.
"Went plus 34 last quarter. The curve is pretty good
this year." He shows you a blue book. On the front
of it is written:
HONOR CODE
(For Women Only)
I have neither given nor received aid
in this test nor have I studied. Remember . . . Keep
the Average Down To Keep the Men Around.
As you stagger through the crowded lobby and
into the soothing cold evening, you remember his
words, "Oh things have changed." You also remember
the funny little smile that sat lopsided on his lips as he
said it.
"And he was the 'nut' who enlisted in '51 to serve
his three years and return in 1954," you say as you
kick yourself firmly in the seat of your khaki pants.

II you should come on campus in 1954. things will be
different. It might surprise you.
Let's say that you get a three day furlough from what
ever branch of the service where you were "needed."
You drive by Eneina to see a buddy. The last thing
you heard, he was a sponsor there. As you walk up
the path, you think you hear a noise from one of the
third story windows. It sounds just like the squeal
of feminine laughter. You say to yourself, "Either I'm
(.racking up or the freshman boys are getting pretty
damn bold-*-in the afternoon at that." You shrug your
.shoulders and decide it just can't be.
You boom up the front steps and start upstairs
to the second floor. Two lovely girls meet you on
I heir way down. You pass one another quizzically,
liv then your mind is really spinning. Suddenly a
ray haired old ladv darts out of a doorway with
a cross body block.
"Young man, what exactly is the idea?" she booms
as you get to your feet.
"I'm just looking for a buddy, ma'am. His name is
"His name? No boys live here. This is a girls'
residence."
' Eneina? A girl's residence, but . . . ," you stammer.
Then the kindly, gray haired half back begins to
( buckle and explains. "Things have changed a wee
hit since . . ."
"You'll probably find him over at Ruble Hall.
That's where we keep them."
"Who, ma'am?"
"The men," she Jeers.
As you stumble out of the foyer you notice that
: omeone has painted it a baby blue with a shot of
chartreuse.
On the way over to Roble you see nothing but
beautiful girls. Tall ones, slim ones, blonds, brunettes,
redheads. "Real Stanford beauties!' you exclaim and
then roll the unfamiliar phrase ovei and over on your
tongue like a strange food. As you walk along you
have an odd feeling as if a hundred eyes ore watching
you—devouring you. About the post office you begin
to run.
V«ni arrive at Roble breathless, your mind a jum
ble. The lobby is full of girls. More Stanford beau
ties. You figure that the old lady was crazv about

men living at Roble. All you want to do by then is
find some nice shade tree and cut out paper dolls
and meditate.
But then you spy a familiar face. It's your buddy.
You weep from confused joy.
"Come on up to my room," he invites as he points
up toward second floor.
You feel as if you're defiling a sacred shrine as you
climb the steps to enter the holy of holies—second
floor at Roble.
You deposit yourself in his luxurious sitting room
with adjoining bath.
"Well, how's the army treating you, boy?" he be
gins. Before you can answer, the telephone rings.
"No. I'm sorry," he begins. "I'm busy tonight. . . .
No. I won't go out with you tonight ... I don't care
if you are a Chappie queen. Please stop bothering me."
He hangs up.
In the "Old Days" your buddy considered himself
lucky to have one date a month. He's not the hand
somest guy in the world either. Your startled open
mouth demands an explanation.
"Oh, things have changed," he laughs. "Haven't you
heard? Let me brief you. First, the ratio is 50 to 1.
That's why all the men are here. The rest of the
campus is all women. Those girls you saw in the
lobby were callers. Everything is Sadie Hawkins style
now. I can't remember when the last time was that
I asked a girl out or paid for a date. Was it last Spring
Quarter or was it Winter Quarter . . . ? Oh. inci
dentally I'm captain of the football team."
You look at his 131 pounds and wonder.
"Competition wasn't too tough." he admits. "I was
going out for boxing too until women's council out
lawed it as a danger to the ratio."
"How are the studies coming?" you ask. Your buddy
was always against the academic ropes in the old days.
"Went plus 34 last quarter. The curve is pretty good
this year." He shows you a blue book. On the front
of it is written:
HONOR CODE
(For Women Only)
I have neither given nor received aid
in this test nor have I studied. Remember . . . Keep
the Average Down To Keep the Men Around.
As you stagger through the crowded lobby and
into the soothing cold evening, you remember his
words, "Oh things have changed." You also remember
the funny little smile that sat lopsided on his lips as he
said it.
"And he was the 'nut' who enlisted in '51 to serve
his three years and return in 1954," you say as you
kick yourself firmly in the seat of your khaki pants.

You drive by Eneina to see a buddy. The last thing
you heard, he was a sponsor there. As you walk up
the path, you think you hear a noise from one of the
third story windows. It sounds just like the squeal
of feminine laughter. You say to yourself, "Either I'm
(.racking up or the freshman boys are getting pretty
damn bold-*-in the afternoon at that." You shrug your
.shoulders and decide it just can't be.
You boom up the front steps and start upstairs
to the second floor. Two lovely girls meet you on
I heir way down. You pass one another quizzically,
liv then your mind is really spinning. Suddenly a
ray haired old ladv darts out of a doorway with
a cross body block.
"Young man, what exactly is the idea?" she booms
as you get to your feet.
"I'm just looking for a buddy, ma'am. His name is
"His name? No boys live here. This is a girls'
residence."
' Eneina? A girl's residence, but . . . ," you stammer.
Then the kindly, gray haired half back begins to
( buckle and explains. "Things have changed a wee
hit since . . ."
"You'll probably find him over at Ruble Hall.
That's where we keep them."
"Who, ma'am?"
"The men," she Jeers.
As you stumble out of the foyer you notice that
: omeone has painted it a baby blue with a shot of
chartreuse.
On the way over to Roble you see nothing but
beautiful girls. Tall ones, slim ones, blonds, brunettes,
redheads. "Real Stanford beauties!' you exclaim and
then roll the unfamiliar phrase ovei and over on your
tongue like a strange food. As you walk along you
have an odd feeling as if a hundred eyes ore watching
you—devouring you. About the post office you begin
to run.
V«ni arrive at Roble breathless, your mind a jum
ble. The lobby is full of girls. More Stanford beau
ties. You figure that the old lady was crazv about

men living at Roble. All you want to do by then is
find some nice shade tree and cut out paper dolls
and meditate.
But then you spy a familiar face. It's your buddy.
You weep from confused joy.
"Come on up to my room," he invites as he points
up toward second floor.
You feel as if you're defiling a sacred shrine as you
climb the steps to enter the holy of holies—second
floor at Roble.
You deposit yourself in his luxurious sitting room
with adjoining bath.
"Well, how's the army treating you, boy?" he be
gins. Before you can answer, the telephone rings.
"No. I'm sorry," he begins. "I'm busy tonight. . . .
No. I won't go out with you tonight ... I don't care
if you are a Chappie queen. Please stop bothering me."
He hangs up.
In the "Old Days" your buddy considered himself
lucky to have one date a month. He's not the hand
somest guy in the world either. Your startled open
mouth demands an explanation.
"Oh, things have changed," he laughs. "Haven't you
heard? Let me brief you. First, the ratio is 50 to 1.
That's why all the men are here. The rest of the
campus is all women. Those girls you saw in the
lobby were callers. Everything is Sadie Hawkins style
now. I can't remember when the last time was that
I asked a girl out or paid for a date. Was it last Spring
Quarter or was it Winter Quarter . . . ? Oh. inci
dentally I'm captain of the football team."
You look at his 131 pounds and wonder.
"Competition wasn't too tough." he admits. "I was
going out for boxing too until women's council out
lawed it as a danger to the ratio."
"How are the studies coming?" you ask. Your buddy
was always against the academic ropes in the old days.
"Went plus 34 last quarter. The curve is pretty good
this year." He shows you a blue book. On the front
of it is written:
HONOR CODE
(For Women Only)
I have neither given nor received aid
in this test nor have I studied. Remember . . . Keep
the Average Down To Keep the Men Around.
As you stagger through the crowded lobby and
into the soothing cold evening, you remember his
words, "Oh things have changed." You also remember
the funny little smile that sat lopsided on his lips as he
said it.
"And he was the 'nut' who enlisted in '51 to serve
his three years and return in 1954," you say as you
kick yourself firmly in the seat of your khaki pants.
