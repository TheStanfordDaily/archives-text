# Indians Hold 'Best of Year' Grid Practice
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Yesterday's football scrimmage
brought a wide smile to Chuck
Taylor's face, and sideline observ
ers termed it the best of the year.
The aspect of the practice that
pleased Tayl~ • the most was the
sharp blocking displayed by the
backs and offensive linemen. Harry
liugasian was at his devastating
best as he outran the whole defense.
Bob Bry an also broke away for a
touchdown.
Bob Mat bias, In lip - top shape
again, showed a lot of potential as
he ripped off several long gains and
put on some powerful blocks. But
lie still lacks polish, and it is not
known if he will make the travel
ing squad.
Charlie Braze! looked good on
blocking as did Skip Crist. Also

impressive in moving the ball were
right halfbacks Ron Cook and Eric
Southwood.
Trainer Connie Jarvis commented
on the injury situation by saying,
'"We're in the best physical shape
lor a third game since we resumed
football after the war. The only
player definitely out is tackle Dick
Cant, who pulled a ligament in his
foot yesterday."
Safety and kicking specialist Dick
Horn threw off a leg bruise and
was in "A-l" shape yesterday. Wes
Laubscht-r. powerful right half, in
dulged in contact work for the first
time in several weeks, and center
Al Robertson returned after a five
week spell with a dislocated shoul
der.
Defensive guard Leon King didn't
.suit up because of a slighly
sprained toe, but will be all right
for Michigan. Tackle Al Kirkland
appeared lo have won a bout with
a slight charley horse and tackle
Bob Latham has shaken off a cold.


LEON KING
—Will be ready to go
