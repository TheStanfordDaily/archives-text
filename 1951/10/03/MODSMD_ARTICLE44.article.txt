## While There's Life...

After sitting through last Saturday's game, the price on our Rose Bowl
tie has been reduced, but we still aren't giving it away. Actually we aren't
as bad off as the game might have indicated. There was nothing wrong out
1 there that a lot of good hard work won't correct.
If that sounds like a ridiculous statement, let us remind those who have
heen around a few years, and tell the freshmen, that in the past two or
three years—contrary to the "long bench" theorists that floated around—
we didn't have the material. At least, not enough of it.
This year we have enough—not plenty—material to make up some
depth. "Pafjpy" Waldorf would laugh at it, but for us it's depth. The ma
terial, we'll have to admit, is at present only potential, but with some ex
perience under their belts, an injury here or there won't throw us on our
I faces.
Another good sign is to be found taking a look at our injury list. For
the first time since the war they don't have to make it up in alphabetical
order. Outside of tackle Dick Gant and guard Barry Smith, no one is
; seriously injured enough to count them out. This, we repeat, is a good
j sign, even at this early stage, but get out your wood and start knocking.
The new Conference ruling this year abolishing freshmen teams and
allowing first year students to play on the varsity squad, if they can make
it, has aided in the Cardinal Cause. Four freshmen to date have managed
to achieve that distinction. Guard Roy Krickenberg, tackle John Ludeke,
i and defensive halfbacks Dave Castellucci and Don Sanders are the l'rosh
I you'll see the most of. They've done a good job to date, and with ex
! periencc. will be tops.

DIPLOMACY DEPARTMENT: An era has passed! We used to get
| a kick out of the antic a football ret would go through in throwing a player
! out of a game. He'd get quite red in the face, stand up straight with his
nose about two inches from that of the player, and hold his arm straight out
pointing to the bench. Sometimes the player would protest, and then the
ref would follow him over to the sidelines pushing him along if he was big
| enough.
Those days are gone forever, it seems. We wonder how many people
observed Spartan quarterback Lynn Aplanalp and Card tackle Leon King
1 getting the old heave-hb for a "misunderstanding" in the game last week
end.

HUMAN INTEREST STUFF: The game ball from last Saturday's San
Jose State contest, which was autographed by the players to Jesse Cone,
was given by Cone to Barry Smith, recuperating in the hospital from a
grid injury incurred a few weeks ago. A very nice gesture, Jesse.
