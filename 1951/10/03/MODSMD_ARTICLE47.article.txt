# Dodger Homers Blast Giants

### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 2 (UP) —
Those last - chance Brooklyn
Dodgers deadlocked the Na
tional League pennant playoff
today when never • quit Jackie
Robinson and kid pitcher Clem
Labine combined talents for a
rainswept, 10 to 0 decision over
the New York Giants before 38,-
609 fans in the Polo Grounds.
It was the magnificent Robinson,
clutch pedal in Brooklyn's sputter
! ing pennant machine, who shilted
j things into high gear with a two- j
I run homer in the fir?t inning.
That gave Labine, the stretch
winning right-handed rookie from
Lincoln. R. 1., a strong working mar
gin. The Dodgers added to it with
j great enthusiasm as time went on.
I as the Giants went into almost a
state of collapse after a 40-minute
delay for rain during the sixth.
Labine Comes Through
The overlooked little hurler dit!-
| n't even start a game for Brooklyn
| until Aug. 28. and Manager Charles
Dressen called on him today only in
an emergency—because he had no
other rested hurlers. But us on oth-

I er occasions he responded brilliant
ly with a cool curve the Giants just ;
I couldn't cope with and emerged
| with his fifth victory against a lone
j defeat.
Labine was no paragon of perfec
| tion out there on the mound. He put
I men on base so often that 11 Giants
| were left stranded. He ga\* up six
hits, walked three, and two more
; arrived on errors, but only two men
I reached third base and none gpt
j around to the home plate pay sta
! tion.
Meanwhile, the Dodgers, acting as
j if they just suddenly were aware
| they had squandered a 13-game lead
in less than two months, quit fool
| ing around.
Giants Hobble
They meant business and were so
| authoritative about it they scared
j the Giants into making five errors
j that contributed to three unearned
I runs in a generally sloppy defen
j sive exhibition by both sides.
The game started under bright
I skies with bright Giant spirits to
j match, but New York's fortunes
i j changed even more quickly than
; | the weather.
i j Pee Wee Reese singled with one
) i out in the first and after starter
• Sheldon Jones struck out Duke Sni

der, Robimon hit hit. home run just
into the left field stands—his lilth
of the year.
Hodges Hits 40th
It was the first of four Dodder
homers in the 13-hit carnival they
enjoyed oil three Giant pitchers.
Gil Hodges., who still has a long
shot chance of catching major
league home run king pin Ralph
Kiner, blasted his 40th home run in
the sixth off George Spencer. Kiner
has 42.
Andy Pufko greeted reliever A 1
Corwin with his 30th homer in the
seventh, and Rube Walker, working
behind the plate for the injured Roy
Campanella, lifted his fourth of the
I year into the seats to account for
I the final two runs in the ninth.
