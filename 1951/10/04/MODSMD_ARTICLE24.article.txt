# They Call Them CO-Curricular
## 
### 
The activity talks given in freshman living
croups last night and tonight are coming at a
good time. Frosh and new transfers have gone
through that first week, that sometimes be
wildering week, and are probably thinking by
now that Stanford isn't guite as big or guite as
complex as they may have imagined.
Fortunately Stanford, unlike Cal, is not a big
school. The Daily Cal recently editorialized,
"It is hard to escape the feeling of being lost
around here unless one can carve out a little
niche of his own. can form a fairly extensive
circle of friends."
There isn't that feeling here. Stanford's not
a big school, but it has big advantages.
It is interesting that at Stanford, student
activities are often spoken oi as CO-carricu
lar, not extra-curricular. And that means just
what it says: that student endeavors outside
the classroom are regarded as an egually im
portant part of Stanford education as "book
larnin'."
The only difference is that outside activities
are not reguired. You don't have to register
for a minimum of 13 units of activities. But in
a very real sense, they are what you are paying
for when you plunk down your tuition each
guarter (you say you're plunking down
plenty?). Why not get the most out of the big
bill?
The activities themselves are varied.
Whether it be the lIR, rally com, KZSU, or what
ever, there's bound to be one that coincides
pretty well with your particular interests.
There are the obvious and practical bene

fits activities offer: there are personal con
tacts in a more or less specialized field that
often are useful after graduation; there is the
opportunity of using activities as laboratories
in v/hich to put into practice the theoretical
knowledge of the class room and the text
book.
And there are benefits that aren't guite so
obvious.
There isn't much difficulty "carving out that
niche of friends" here. But obviously, friend
ship takes many forms. Activities can offer
friendships based on common interest, common
ambitions. Living groups, whether large dor
mitories or row houses in most cases can't help
but be melting pots. And that's good. Learning
to live with diverse personalities, sharing your
interests, and learning from others can be one
of the biggest values of Stanford education.
Activities offer the opportunity to "talk
shop" with those who understand and ap
preciate that shop talk. That's important, too.
They offer the satisfaction of group projects
successfully accomplished. They take an im
portant part of education out of the individual
level into the collective level.
And if the old question of time is bothering
you, in most cases you'll be able to spare it.
The first week of academic life at Stanford is
pretty much like the weeks that follow. Things
start off at full throttle.
So if you've weathered this first week with
out undue strain, you'll be able to handle some
thing extra. Or rather ,we should say someth
ing co.—J. M.

friendships based on common interest, common
ambitions. Living groups, whether large dor
mitories or row houses in most cases can't help
but be melting pots. And that's good. Learning
to live with diverse personalities, sharing your
interests, and learning from others can be one
of the biggest values of Stanford education.
Activities offer the opportunity to "talk
shop" with those who understand and ap
preciate that shop talk. That's important, too.
They offer the satisfaction of group projects
successfully accomplished. They take an im
portant part of education out of the individual
level into the collective level.
And if the old question of time is bothering
you, in most cases you'll be able to spare it.
The first week of academic life at Stanford is
pretty much like the weeks that follow. Things
start off at full throttle.
So if you've weathered this first week with
out undue strain, you'll be able to handle some
thing extra. Or rather ,we should say someth
ing co.—J. M.
The activity talks given in freshman living
croups last night and tonight are coming at a
good time. Frosh and new transfers have gone
through that first week, that sometimes be
wildering week, and are probably thinking by
now that Stanford isn't guite as big or guite as
complex as they may have imagined.
Fortunately Stanford, unlike Cal, is not a big
school. The Daily Cal recently editorialized,
"It is hard to escape the feeling of being lost
around here unless one can carve out a little
niche of his own. can form a fairly extensive
circle of friends."
There isn't that feeling here. Stanford's not
a big school, but it has big advantages.
It is interesting that at Stanford, student
activities are often spoken oi as CO-carricu
lar, not extra-curricular. And that means just
what it says: that student endeavors outside
the classroom are regarded as an egually im
portant part of Stanford education as "book
larnin'."
The only difference is that outside activities
are not reguired. You don't have to register
for a minimum of 13 units of activities. But in
a very real sense, they are what you are paying
for when you plunk down your tuition each
guarter (you say you're plunking down
plenty?). Why not get the most out of the big
bill?
The activities themselves are varied.
Whether it be the lIR, rally com, KZSU, or what
ever, there's bound to be one that coincides
pretty well with your particular interests.
There are the obvious and practical bene

fits activities offer: there are personal con
tacts in a more or less specialized field that
often are useful after graduation; there is the
opportunity of using activities as laboratories
in v/hich to put into practice the theoretical
knowledge of the class room and the text
book.
And there are benefits that aren't guite so
obvious.
There isn't much difficulty "carving out that
niche of friends" here. But obviously, friend
ship takes many forms. Activities can offer
friendships based on common interest, common
ambitions. Living groups, whether large dor
mitories or row houses in most cases can't help
