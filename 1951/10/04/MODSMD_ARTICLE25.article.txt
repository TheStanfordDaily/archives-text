# It's Your Play, Rally Com

Rally Committee, which seems to hold the
unenviable position of Stanford's favorite
v/hipping boy, is taking it on the chin once
again from a good portion of the student body.
This time, it's the announcement that only
three more rallies are definitely set for this year.
These rallies will be held before the UCLA,
Santa Clara and Cal games. Rallies may also
be held for the USC and OSC games.
Rally Com says the decision was recommend
ed by last year's committee. The idea is to put
all the efforts of the committee behind impor
tant rallies, and to eliminate rallies for not-so
vital ball games. Thus there will be no Michi
gan rally this week.
It's a new idea and worthy of a trial, perhaps.

Frankly, we feel that it would be wiser to
schedule big rallies for the big games and
smaller —not necessarily duller —rallies for the
other games. Be that as it may, Rally Com now
finds itself on a spot where they will be ex
pected to produce extra good rallies for the
rest of the year. This is a challenge which we
hope they will meet with all kinds of success.
The pre-San Jose rally got Rally Com off to
a bad start last Friday. Many complaints have
been voiced about this rally, and the commit
tee itself admits it wasn't too red hot. But it
wasn't the first poor rally at Stanford by any
manner or means, and three corking good ones (
to follow will erase the bad taste of the first one.
It's your play, Rally Com.
