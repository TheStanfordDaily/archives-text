# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
This journalism racket isn't for me. Deadlines to
meet. Punchlines being mangled by the typesetter.
No. it's too much strain. Now. musical comedy, that's
another story . . . ah, for the life of a thespian.

This brings me to the point that
I have written a script for the
Big Game Gaieties which I con
sider to be very splendid. And if
the Ram's Head gang wants to
use it. it's their for the asking.
Here's how it goes:
A chorus of 50 gorgeous girls
and 50 statuesque men will romp
onto the stage, and to the tune
of "Oklahoma" they will sing:

L.S.J.U.. where the football players do not cheat.
Where the soph'mores yell.
"With '55, hell!"
And the Chappie is not discreet.
We know that Stanford is dear,
'Cause we pay $'>(>() a year,
And then we say,
Yip-a-yipee aye yea.
We're really savin' you're going to win the Big Cal
Game,
L.5.J.11., Hooray!
In the next scene the football-playing hero, who
will have the body of a Greek god and the voice of
Ezio Pinza, is in a dilemma. He has a test coming
up, and if he Hunks it.it means he can't play in the
Big Game. To the tune of "Oh. What a Beautiful
Morning" he bursts into song:
Oh, what a terrible morning.
Oh. what a miserable day,
I've got an eight o'clock exam.
Nothing is going my way.
He passes the test, and everyone is happy except
the villain, who is 250-pound Pappy Waldorf. Portly
Pappy, it seems, is on a diet, but he can't seem to
reduce. Pappy steps front stage center, and with the
violins accompanying in a minor key, he sings two
choruses of "I'm Waiting for Hios That Never Came
In."
Pappy is a basso profundo, and as soon as he
finishes harrumphing a few encores the chorus glides
onto the stage. '1 hey face Pappy, and intone to the
tune of "The Cardinal Is Waving":
Pappy is crying all over the field.
khhler is moaning with a spirit that will not yield.

and we're at the scene of the Big Game. The Stan
ford eleven breaks from the huddle and laces the
rooting section. And together with all the substi
tutes they sing to the tune of "Go, You Stanford
Red
Go, you Rally Com!
Go out and put your card tricks into place.
Show 'em. Rally Com!
Don't let those Cal Bears win the race.
Make those rooters wear a cap.
Don't let the pom-poms overlap.
And tell 'cm the good news,
That you've got whiter saddle shoes.
'Cause this year you can't go
To the Rose Bowl.
B'inully all the pre-Big Game festivities are over,
You're in a hole,
Sob! Sob! Sob. Farewell, old Berkeley,

sider to be very splendid. And if
the Ram's Head gang wants to
use it. it's their for the asking.
Here's how it goes:
A chorus of 50 gorgeous girls
and 50 statuesque men will romp
onto the stage, and to the tune
of "Oklahoma" they will sing:

L.S.J.U.. where the football players do not cheat.
Where the soph'mores yell.
"With '55, hell!"
And the Chappie is not discreet.
We know that Stanford is dear,
'Cause we pay $'>(>() a year,
And then we say,
Yip-a-yipee aye yea.
We're really savin' you're going to win the Big Cal
Game,
L.5.J.11., Hooray!
In the next scene the football-playing hero, who
will have the body of a Greek god and the voice of
Ezio Pinza, is in a dilemma. He has a test coming
up, and if he Hunks it.it means he can't play in the
Big Game. To the tune of "Oh. What a Beautiful
Morning" he bursts into song:
Oh, what a terrible morning.
Oh. what a miserable day,
I've got an eight o'clock exam.
Nothing is going my way.
He passes the test, and everyone is happy except
the villain, who is 250-pound Pappy Waldorf. Portly
Pappy, it seems, is on a diet, but he can't seem to
reduce. Pappy steps front stage center, and with the
violins accompanying in a minor key, he sings two
choruses of "I'm Waiting for Hios That Never Came
In."
Pappy is a basso profundo, and as soon as he
finishes harrumphing a few encores the chorus glides
onto the stage. '1 hey face Pappy, and intone to the
tune of "The Cardinal Is Waving":
Pappy is crying all over the field.
khhler is moaning with a spirit that will not yield.

and we're at the scene of the Big Game. The Stan
ford eleven breaks from the huddle and laces the
rooting section. And together with all the substi
tutes they sing to the tune of "Go, You Stanford
Red
Go, you Rally Com!
Go out and put your card tricks into place.
Show 'em. Rally Com!
Don't let those Cal Bears win the race.
Make those rooters wear a cap.
Don't let the pom-poms overlap.
And tell 'cm the good news,
That you've got whiter saddle shoes.
'Cause this year you can't go
To the Rose Bowl.
B'inully all the pre-Big Game festivities are over,
You're in a hole,
Sob! Sob! Sob. Farewell, old Berkeley,

This journalism racket isn't for me. Deadlines to
meet. Punchlines being mangled by the typesetter.
No. it's too much strain. Now. musical comedy, that's
another story . . . ah, for the life of a thespian.

This brings me to the point that
I have written a script for the
Big Game Gaieties which I con
