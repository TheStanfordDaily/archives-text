Then 10. the sleeping giant woke
And with one mighty, sweeping stroke,
Broke the hearts of a million and some
Who loved and followed the fabulous Bum.
Balancing there at the threshold of fame,
At once so savage, at once so tame,
The mighty Dodger team so bold
Looked like the famous Dodgers of old.
The infield had that spark sublime,
Their hatters swung in perfect time,
Their pitchers had their second wind . . .
One of the Dodgers must have sinned.
A ,giant man with a giant hat
Took (.ne mighty, giant swat
And placed that white, evil sphere
Into the left field second tier.
He sent three men around the bases
And left a look on Canarsic faces
That showed their emotion, fear, and strain
As they watched five Q's go down the drain.
If tears fill your bloodshot eyes
And blackness covers deep blue skies.
If a poolroom pallor replaces tan.
My deepest condolences,' Brooklyn fan.
