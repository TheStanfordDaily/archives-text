# Coeds Uphold Demerit Plan
## 
### 
The 85% of Stanford women pos
sessing less than one demerit at the
present time illustrate the success of
the accumulative demerit system of
women's social regulations.
This year new emphasis is being
placed on the Fundamental Standard
as the basis for the letter of the regu
lations, with its stress on personal in
tegrity and individual responsibility.
A demerit, the stiffest penalty for
social regulation offenses, is meted
out for a late return of 30 minutes or
an accumulation of five lockouts,
which total 30 minutes or less; three
offenses; or eight technicals. Women's
Council is empowered to inflict social
probation (restriction of late leaves)
on four-demerit offenders and may
suspend girls with five demerits.
A technical is the failure of a girl
to record all required information on
her signout slip. A lockout is a late
return after a girl's bonus has been
completely used.
The bonus is a 15 minutes leeway
designed for emergencies and re
newed each quarter. The bonus may
only be used three times per quarter
and is never reinstated.
An offense is defined as a violation
of social regulations which is neither
a lockout nor a technical, such as the
failure to sign out or sign in.
The five Women's Council members
hear social regulations cases and ap
peals. The Women's Council repre
sentative is the educator in her resi
dence, and each girl is encouraged to
consult her for any information con
cerning social regulations.
Council members are: Chairman
Helen Austin, Storey; Alice Gait,
Manzanita; Jean Symon and Donnie
Stewart, Union; and Betty Lou Edson,
La thro p.
