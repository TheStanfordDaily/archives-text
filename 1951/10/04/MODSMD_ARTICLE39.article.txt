## The 						Sporting Line

The Farm's football fortunes seem a little cloudy right now. The
current opinion of some is to sell that old, moth-eaten Ross Bowl tie for
whatever you can get â€”and that's more than it's worth. Others are
making New Year's reservations for Pasadena. Why such a big difference
in opinion?
First off, this year's Eig Red Machine has been pretty deceptive. It
looks like a real streamlined model, and you couldn't ask for a better
driver than Chuck Taylor. But put it in some competition and it barely
sputters over the finish line ahead of some second-rate foes. Nobody
seems to have the reasons, except maybe a little more tuning up.
Other disturbing factors are the other entrants in the PCC derby. It
looks like one of the hottest fights for the Roses in many years. Lots of
teams are strong and evenly matched. Cal and Washington rate top bill -
ing. The Huskies, missing All-American Heinrich for the first part of
the season, can be had. Cal rumbles forward powerfully, as usual, but no
chance for the January first date.
The next bracket includes USC, UCLA, the surprising Oregon Staters,
and the Indians. All show the ability to win games. Perhaps a little light
can be focused on the pictures. Having seen both the Trojans and the
Bruins in action, we offer a few sage comments. Take 'em for what they're
worth.
Bruins Ain't
Red Sanders is no miracle-worker. The Baby Blue Bruins are too small
and too undermanned to come up with a real contender. Ted Narleski is
no Ernie Johnson; his effectiveness at tailback is even lessened because
the Bruin line isn't strong enough to give him enough time for the op
tional pass plays and the tricky reverses of the single-wing attack. Against
Texas A&M the whole offensive pattern looked disorganized and funda
mentals were sloppy. No top-Hight passer either. Standouts are Donn
Moomaw, linebacker, captain Hal Mitchell at tackle, blocking back Julie
Weisstein, and end Ernie Stokfrt. A real red-hot newcomer is soph Paul
Cameron at tailback.
Trojans Could Is<*
As lor the Great Experiment, as the LA writers dub the SC team, Jess
Hill and his very excellent coaching staff could very easily turn the Blun
dering Herd into one of the old-time Thunderirtg Herds. Plenty of man
power and beel at every position. Pat Cannamela and George Bozanic are
one of the slickest combos in business. Frank Gifford and A 1 Carmichael
are both hard-running backs. Almost three deep at every post, the middle
ol the Troy line could really harden into concrete-like proportions. Re
member names like Welsh, Willhoite, Weeks, Van Doren, Sanbrano, Ane,
Conde, and Pucci. After a sloppy opener against admittedly weak Wash
ington State, the Trojans stomped all over San Diego Navy. And the Blue
jackets, a few weeks back, didn't look too bad against the pro Rams.
The whole picture should clear up plenty with several key games on
tap over the weekend. The Troy-boys tie into Washington up north. The
winner of that fray could easily come up smelling like the proverbial
rose. Cal brushes into Minnesota, not a great power, but a team good
enough to give the Huskies quite a tussle. And, of course, the Indians plane
for Ann Arbor and the very hungry Wolverines. The results of these three
key contests plus judging how well UCLA bounces back against Santa
Clara should add up to a clearer view of the Coast Conference. But
then again, what would you say if SC wallops Washington, the Bears fold
before Minnesota, and the Indians clobber Michigan? And why not? The
Giants did it.
