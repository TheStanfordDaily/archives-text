# Thompson's Historic Three-Run Blast Brings Giants National League Flag
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
In one of baseball's greatest games, Bobby Thompson slapped
a ninth inning homer high into the left-field stands to give the
New York Giants a 5 to 4 win over the Brooklyn Dodgers and the
right to meet the Yankees in the World Series opener today.
The Giants had astounded the baseball world by overcoming a

| 13"2 game Brooklyn lead to end tht
regular season in a tie; but that come
back was not nearly as miraculous
as the one they perpetrated in the
ninth inning of yesterday's game.
The Dodgers had seemingly iced
1 the game in the top of the eighth
j frame when they broke a 1-1 dead
lock on a tatoo of singles through,
off, and around third-baseman Thom
[ son.
Dodger mainstay, Don Newcombe
j had blazed his fast bail past the Giants
j through the first eight frames in
: glorious style, but in the ninth, he
ran out of gas. Alvin Dark and Don
Mueller combed singles between first
and second. Newcombe got the dan
gerous Monte Irvin to pop up to first,
but then Whitey Lockman piled a
double down the lelt-field line and
the Giants trailed 4-2 with two on
and one out. The bedraggled New
combe shuffled off to the showers and
manager Dressen inserted Branca to
j face Thomson, who after a year and
: a halt slump has apparently regained
his batting eye. Branca fed him a
slider which caught the inside corner
for a strike. Branca then tried the
identical pitch, but Thomson solved
this offering for his historic blast.
The Dodgers had opened the scor
ing in the first inning when Pee Wee
Reese and Duke Snider worked Giant
ace Sal Maglie for a walk and Jackie

civ-c: wjcii mugjjc iui c« vvuirv ajiu cMH~n.it:
Robinson singled.
Through the next six innings, New
combe's spued and Maglie's four
speed curve battled on even terms.
Then in the seventh Monte Irvin
doubled and scored on a sacrifice and
Thomson's long Hy. All this merely
set the stage for the dramatic last
two innings, however.
Larry Janson who relieved Maglie
in the eighth received credit for his
twenty-second win, while Ralph
Branca, who threw two pitches, took
the loss.
The win gave the Giants a two out
of three victory in the playoff series.
; The Giants took the opener 3 to 1 and
[ lost yesterday 10 to 0.

According to Chuck Taylor this 205 pound tackle is being
sought by numerous pro scouts and is one of the finest tackles
extant.

In one of baseball's greatest games, Bobby Thompson slapped
a ninth inning homer high into the left-field stands to give the
New York Giants a 5 to 4 win over the Brooklyn Dodgers and the
right to meet the Yankees in the World Series opener today.
The Giants had astounded the baseball world by overcoming a

| 13"2 game Brooklyn lead to end tht
regular season in a tie; but that come
back was not nearly as miraculous
as the one they perpetrated in the
ninth inning of yesterday's game.
The Dodgers had seemingly iced
1 the game in the top of the eighth
j frame when they broke a 1-1 dead
lock on a tatoo of singles through,
off, and around third-baseman Thom
[ son.
Dodger mainstay, Don Newcombe
j had blazed his fast bail past the Giants
j through the first eight frames in
: glorious style, but in the ninth, he
ran out of gas. Alvin Dark and Don
Mueller combed singles between first
and second. Newcombe got the dan
gerous Monte Irvin to pop up to first,
but then Whitey Lockman piled a
double down the lelt-field line and
the Giants trailed 4-2 with two on
and one out. The bedraggled New
combe shuffled off to the showers and
manager Dressen inserted Branca to
j face Thomson, who after a year and
: a halt slump has apparently regained
his batting eye. Branca fed him a
slider which caught the inside corner
for a strike. Branca then tried the
identical pitch, but Thomson solved
this offering for his historic blast.
The Dodgers had opened the scor
ing in the first inning when Pee Wee
Reese and Duke Snider worked Giant
ace Sal Maglie for a walk and Jackie

Robinson singled.
Through the next six innings, New
combe's spued and Maglie's four
speed curve battled on even terms.
Then in the seventh Monte Irvin
doubled and scored on a sacrifice and
Thomson's long Hy. All this merely
set the stage for the dramatic last
two innings, however.
Larry Janson who relieved Maglie
in the eighth received credit for his
twenty-second win, while Ralph
Branca, who threw two pitches, took
the loss.
The win gave the Giants a two out
of three victory in the playoff series.
; The Giants took the opener 3 to 1 and
[ lost yesterday 10 to 0.


Here is TOM JOHNSON, Michigan's all-American candidate.
According to Chuck Taylor this 205 pound tackle is being
sought by numerous pro scouts and is one of the finest tackles
extant.
