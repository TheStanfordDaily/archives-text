# Mathias, Bryan Will Make Trip East With Gridders
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Boh Mathias and Bob Bryan were |
named to the 38 - man traveling !
I squad which left for Ann Arbor at
6 this morning, thus answering the
j number one question in practice
j this week: Would Bryan and Ma- j
! thias go?
Chuck Taylor ran his team

through the third scrimmage in as I
many days yesterday. It was a pass
ing scrimmage, and it sounded the i
note that Stanford will very likely
fill the air with passes against the
Michigan Wolverines. Bill McColl
particularly impressed with his re
ceiving.
The status of Bryan and Mathias
remained an enigma until after j
practice yesterday when Taylor j
broke the news that both would j
make the trip. A toe injury and
then a pulled muscle had kept Ma
thias from working out, and it was ,
feared that maybe he wasn't famil
iar enough with the Stanford sys
tem to make the trip.
The Olympic decathlon champ,
however, impressed spectators all |
week with his hard running and his
speed. He also laid on several hard j
blocks. Taylor remarked, "That
boy's going to make a real ball
player."
Bryan had proven himself in the
running department, but the
coaches hadn't been satisfied with
his blocking and determination.
Bryan has been a different per
former of late, however, and his
speed will lend itself well to the
attack Stanford has planned against
the Wolverines.
l'he Indians are in top health.
Only tackle Dick Gant won't make
the trip. He was limping noticeably
yesterday with a pulled ligament in
his foot. Dr. Fritz Roth says he will
return next week.
The team will land in Chicago
this afternoon and work out at Sol
diers' Field. Then they will move
on to Ann Arbor.
Joe Ruetz, who scouted Michi

â– 
gan, warned that the Maize-and-
Blue are no soft touches. "Never
underestimate Michigan," said the
former St. Mary's headman. "Re
member that they were beaten by
a team that is first or second in the
nation, so don't take that 25 to 0
score too seriously."
"They have a stronger deefnse

than we do, but our passing anil
running attack is superior to theirs.
They have a top offensive threat in
end Lowell Perry, and tackle Tom
Johnson is rated All-American."


AND HERE'S 808 MATHIAS, fully recovered from the pulled
muscle that kept him sidelined through the Indians' first two
1 contests, who is making the Michigan trip and is expected to see
! action against the Wolverines.
