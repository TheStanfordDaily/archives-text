# New Alpiners Scale Miraloma
## 
### 
Last Sunday the Stanford Al
pine members were outnum
bered two to one by the begin
ners, who were anxious to par
ticipate in the club's practice
climb.
Miraloma Rocks in San Francisco
look easy from a distance to the ama
teur, but there are many routes that
try even the veteran climbers.
The Alpiners taught the begin
ners the need for safety from the
different knots that they would have
to tic, to the art of the correct use
of the safety rope that they would
have to climb with. Both safety meas
ures were put to constant test
throughout the day, but as usual with
rock climbing there were no acci
dents.
The veterans expressed amazement
that the beginners were able to con
quer several of the difficult routes.
The Alpiners pointed out that some
of the climbing is on a small scale of
some of the more difficult climbing
found in Yoscmite.
The dress of the group ran from
slacks and loafers to bluejeans and
tennis shoes. There seemed to be
good indication that these same out
fits will again appear at the climb
next Sunday as their owners attempt
to conquer the routes Jhat they didn't
succeed at the first time.


SLOW BUT SUREâ€”Stanfordites who had never climbed any
thing higher than the Knoll joined with Alpine members to par
ticipate in their first practice climb. The knots are not easy to
learn the first time, but the beginners had plenty of help from


the old members. The ropes are the only method of safety for
the climber once he slips, and there were lots of slips. Miraloma
Rock in San Francisco offered a challenge to the group, but many
made good in getting to the top without failing in the attempt.
