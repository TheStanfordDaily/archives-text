## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 3 (UP)—Rus
sia's second a-bomh explosion in
nearly two years was announced by
the White House today, and one con
gressman said it may mean the Soviet
Union is working on guided missiles
with atomic warheads.
The terse announcement issued by
White House Press Secretary Joseph
Short gave no details of the new So
viet test beyond the bare fact that
"another atomic bomb has recently
been exploded within the Soviet
Union."
Short said the event "confirms
again that the Soviet Union is con
tinuing to make atomic weapons" and
gives the lie to communist propa
ganda claims that the Soviet atomic
program is being directed exclusively
toward peaceful purposes."
Short said Mr. Truman told him to
stress that the United States still
seeks '"effective and enforceable in
ternational controls" over atomic
energy. Russia has. blocked such con
trols and some Americans believe
this country should withdraw its
original plan.
Rep. Henry M. Jackson, D„ Wash.,
predicted that the news will spur the
congressional atomic energy commit
tee to act tomorrow on a resolution
calling for an "all-out," $6 billion a
year expansion of the U.S. atomic
program.
