# Cards Try for National Recognition
## Michigan Rated Seven-Point Favorites Over Cards 
### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's undefeated, untied,
and untried football team moves
into giant Ann Arbor Stadium
to try to do what Cal couldn't—
beat Michigan.
Granted that the Wolverines are
not the same powerhouse that ran
over the Bears in the Rose Bowl
last year, they still supply very
formidable opposition. Michigan
State ran over the Wolverines' un
protesting form, 25 to 0, last week,
but Michigan State is rated one
of the two best teams in the coun
try, and it is no disgrace to lose
to them.
Right now, the men who make the
odds think so highly of the Wolver
ines and so unhighly of the Indians
that they are making Michigan sev
en-point favorites.
Although the Michigan tussle
won't count in the PCC standings,
it will be a crucial in many respects.
Onn, it will determine whether the
Red Machine "has it." San Jose
and Oregon gave Stanford trouble,
but they didn't provide an adequate
test of the Cards' strength. If the
Tnylornien beat Michigan, it means
that they must he counted in the
race for the Roses.
Two, if Stanford is tied at the
end of the year for first place, the
PCC directors will look at the score
of the Michigan game, and that may
tip the scales.
The Big Ten Sneers
Three, the Midwesterners have
pitifully little regard for Western
football. They believe that any Big
Ten team can whip any Pacific
Coast team six times a week and
twice on Sundays. Thus, it offers
Stanford a terrific challenge to show
the Midwesterners that the PCC
brand of football is not to be
sneered at. Particularly, the Stan
ford brand of football.
And. four, the Midwestern and
Eastern sportswriters will have to
be " hown" that Bill McColl really
is an All-American and that some
of the other Indian footballers arc
as good as they're cracked up to be.
Those who saw Stanford in
practice this past week think the
Indians ran meet the challenge.

They showed Iftrt per cent im
provement on their blocking and
pass protection. Also their run
ning attack was rolling in high
gear.
Bob Mathias showed himself to
good advantage as he broke away
for several good gains in scrim
mage. Harry Hugasian may be
ready for the greatest game of his
career, if this week's three scrim
mages mean anything. And Joe
Ruetz's scout reports show that
Bobby Bryan is faster than any
thing the Wolverines can offer.
Passing Will Be Stressed
However, insiders believe that
passing will be stressed. The Cards
have worked on the aerial game all
week, and Bill McColl's talents will
probably he drawn upon to a good
extent. Stanford hasn't overworked
the 225-pound end this season: They
have only thrown sever! passes'his
way, three of which went for touch
downs.
Michigan will undoubtedly put
two men on McColl (which he is
used to), and that will mean com
parative freedom for Bill Storum
and Sam Morlcy. Bryan's and
Eric South wood's speed will also
be probably used to good advan
tage in the passing attack.
Also, expect Gary Kcrkorian to
wheel back for a pass and then
hand the porker to Bob Meyers on
a delayed trap play. That will be
crossing up the opposition all year.
It went for a score against San Jose.
Don't Forget the Odds
But remember that the Maize

and-Blue are a one-touchdown fa
vorite, and there are good reasons
for this. According to Ruetz, the
Wolverines have a better defense
thaji Stanford. Their pass defense is
tops, evidenced by the fact that
Michigan State only completed four
tosses last week.
Michigan has an Ail-American
tackle in Tom Johnson. The 225-
pound Negro was knocked cold in
the first quarter last week, and
his lass crippled the Michigan de
fense. But he will be in top shape
for the Cards.
The Mic'niganders possess one of
the best linebackers in the Big Ten
in Roger Zatkoff. Ruetz estimates
that Zatkoff made 60 per cent of
the Wolverines' tackles

the great Dick Kempthorri, ]?ias a

success of his linebacking tactics.
Kcmpthorn said, "I looked for the
tip-offs, I let the decoys go by—l
concentrated on the ball."
Zatkoff said, "I just see them
coming ... I hit them."
Perry Is Top Threat
Michigan's top offensive threat is
Lowell Perry, who plays end on
offense and safety on defense. Per
ry, a very lithe pass receiver, will
test the Card pass defense to the
fullest.
The hosts will start a backfield
of captain Bill Pitich at quarter
back, Don Oldham at left half,
Frank Howell at right half, and Tom

Witherspoon at the all - important
fullback post. As is well known,
Michigan employs the type of sin-
I gle - wing offense that is trickicr
I than the "T," complete with buck
laterals, spinners, etc.
The Card gridders arrived in Chi
cago yesterday, and got rid of their
| "air legs" at Stagg Field. They ran
through some brisk drills without
| any contact work. Tomorrow they
i take the train to Ann Arbor.
The Injuns are in good health,
the best shape they've been in
| all year.
As a sidelight, Ernie McCoy,
Michigan's chief scout, has perhaps
the greatest record in college scout
ing. Michigan hasn't lost a game ho
scouted since 1945. And it was Mc-
Coy who scouted Stanford in the
| last two games.

Ruetz's scout reports show that
Bobby Bryan is faster than any
thing the Wolverines can offer.
Passing Will Be Stressed
However, insiders believe that
passing will be stressed. The Cards
have worked on the aerial game all
week, and Bill McColl's talents will
probably he drawn upon to a good
extent. Stanford hasn't overworked
the 225-pound end this season: They
have only thrown sever! passes'his
way, three of which went for touch
downs.
Michigan will undoubtedly put
two men on McColl (which he is
used to), and that will mean com
parative freedom for Bill Storum
and Sam Morlcy. Bryan's and
Eric South wood's speed will also
be probably used to good advan
tage in the passing attack.
Also, expect Gary Kcrkorian to
wheel back for a pass and then
hand the porker to Bob Meyers on
a delayed trap play. That will be
crossing up the opposition all year.
It went for a score against San Jose.
Don't Forget the Odds
But remember that the Maize

and-Blue are a one-touchdown fa
vorite, and there are good reasons
for this. According to Ruetz, the
Wolverines have a better defense
thaji Stanford. Their pass defense is
tops, evidenced by the fact that
Michigan State only completed four
tosses last week.
Michigan has an Ail-American
tackle in Tom Johnson. The 225-
pound Negro was knocked cold in
the first quarter last week, and
his lass crippled the Michigan de
fense. But he will be in top shape
for the Cards.
The Mic'niganders possess one of
the best linebackers in the Big Ten
in Roger Zatkoff. Ruetz estimates
that Zatkoff made 60 per cent of
the Wolverines' tackles

Zatkoff said, "I just see them
coming ... I hit them."
Perry Is Top Threat
Michigan's top offensive threat is
Lowell Perry, who plays end on
offense and safety on defense. Per
ry, a very lithe pass receiver, will
test the Card pass defense to the
fullest.
The hosts will start a backfield
of captain Bill Pitich at quarter
back, Don Oldham at left half,
Frank Howell at right half, and Tom

Witherspoon at the all - important
fullback post. As is well known,
Michigan employs the type of sin-
I gle - wing offense that is trickicr
I than the "T," complete with buck
laterals, spinners, etc.
The Card gridders arrived in Chi
cago yesterday, and got rid of their
| "air legs" at Stagg Field. They ran
through some brisk drills without

i take the train to Ann Arbor.
The Injuns are in good health,
the best shape they've been in
| all year.
As a sidelight, Ernie McCoy,
Michigan's chief scout, has perhaps
the greatest record in college scout
ing. Michigan hasn't lost a game ho
scouted since 1945. And it was Mc-
Coy who scouted Stanford in the
| last two games.

Stanford's undefeated, untied,
and untried football team moves
into giant Ann Arbor Stadium
to try to do what Cal couldn't—
beat Michigan.
Granted that the Wolverines are
not the same powerhouse that ran
over the Bears in the Rose Bowl
last year, they still supply very
formidable opposition. Michigan
State ran over the Wolverines' un
protesting form, 25 to 0, last week,
but Michigan State is rated one
of the two best teams in the coun
try, and it is no disgrace to lose
to them.
Right now, the men who make the
odds think so highly of the Wolver
ines and so unhighly of the Indians
that they are making Michigan sev
en-point favorites.
Although the Michigan tussle
won't count in the PCC standings,
it will be a crucial in many respects.
Onn, it will determine whether the
Red Machine "has it." San Jose
and Oregon gave Stanford trouble,
but they didn't provide an adequate
test of the Cards' strength. If the
Tnylornien beat Michigan, it means
that they must he counted in the
race for the Roses.
Two, if Stanford is tied at the
end of the year for first place, the
PCC directors will look at the score
of the Michigan game, and that may
tip the scales.
The Big Ten Sneers
Three, the Midwesterners have
pitifully little regard for Western
football. They believe that any Big
Ten team can whip any Pacific
Coast team six times a week and
twice on Sundays. Thus, it offers
Stanford a terrific challenge to show
the Midwesterners that the PCC
brand of football is not to be
sneered at. Particularly, the Stan
ford brand of football.
And. four, the Midwestern and
Eastern sportswriters will have to
be " hown" that Bill McColl really
is an All-American and that some
of the other Indian footballers arc
as good as they're cracked up to be.
Those who saw Stanford in
practice this past week think the
Indians ran meet the challenge.

They showed Iftrt per cent im
provement on their blocking and
pass protection. Also their run
ning attack was rolling in high
gear.
Bob Mathias showed himself to
good advantage as he broke away
for several good gains in scrim
mage. Harry Hugasian may be
ready for the greatest game of his
career, if this week's three scrim

The hosts will start a backfield
of captain Bill Pitich at quarter
back, Don Oldham at left half,
Frank Howell at right half, and Tom

Witherspoon at the all - important
fullback post. As is well known,
Michigan employs the type of sin-
I gle - wing offense that is trickicr
I than the "T," complete with buck
laterals, spinners, etc.
The Card gridders arrived in Chi
cago yesterday, and got rid of their
| "air legs" at Stagg Field. They ran
through some brisk drills without
| any contact work. Tomorrow they
i take the train to Ann Arbor.
The Injuns are in good health,
the best shape they've been in
| all year.
As a sidelight, Ernie McCoy,
Michigan's chief scout, has perhaps
the greatest record in college scout
ing. Michigan hasn't lost a game ho
scouted since 1945. And it was Mc-
Coy who scouted Stanford in the
| last two games.

Stanford's undefeated, untied,
and untried football team moves
into giant Ann Arbor Stadium
to try to do what Cal couldn't—
beat Michigan.
Granted that the Wolverines are
not the same powerhouse that ran
over the Bears in the Rose Bowl
last year, they still supply very
formidable opposition. Michigan
State ran over the Wolverines' un
protesting form, 25 to 0, last week,
but Michigan State is rated one
of the two best teams in the coun
try, and it is no disgrace to lose
to them.
Right now, the men who make the
odds think so highly of the Wolver
ines and so unhighly of the Indians
that they are making Michigan sev
en-point favorites.
Although the Michigan tussle
won't count in the PCC standings,
it will be a crucial in many respects.
Onn, it will determine whether the
Red Machine "has it." San Jose
and Oregon gave Stanford trouble,
but they didn't provide an adequate
test of the Cards' strength. If the
Tnylornien beat Michigan, it means
that they must he counted in the
race for the Roses.
Two, if Stanford is tied at the
end of the year for first place, the
PCC directors will look at the score
of the Michigan game, and that may
tip the scales.
The Big Ten Sneers
Three, the Midwesterners have
pitifully little regard for Western
football. They believe that any Big
Ten team can whip any Pacific
Coast team six times a week and
twice on Sundays. Thus, it offers
Stanford a terrific challenge to show
the Midwesterners that the PCC
brand of football is not to be
sneered at. Particularly, the Stan
ford brand of football.
And. four, the Midwestern and
Eastern sportswriters will have to
be " hown" that Bill McColl really
is an All-American and that some
of the other Indian footballers arc
as good as they're cracked up to be.
Those who saw Stanford in
practice this past week think the
Indians ran meet the challenge.

They showed Iftrt per cent im
provement on their blocking and
pass protection. Also their run
ning attack was rolling in high
gear.
Bob Mathias showed himself to
good advantage as he broke away
for several good gains in scrim
mage. Harry Hugasian may be
ready for the greatest game of his
career, if this week's three scrim
mages mean anything. And Joe
Ruetz's scout reports show that
Bobby Bryan is faster than any
thing the Wolverines can offer.
Passing Will Be Stressed
However, insiders believe that
passing will be stressed. The Cards
have worked on the aerial game all
week, and Bill McColl's talents will
probably he drawn upon to a good
extent. Stanford hasn't overworked
the 225-pound end this season: They
have only thrown sever! passes'his
way, three of which went for touch
downs.
Michigan will undoubtedly put
two men on McColl (which he is
used to), and that will mean com
parative freedom for Bill Storum
and Sam Morlcy. Bryan's and
Eric South wood's speed will also
be probably used to good advan
tage in the passing attack.
Also, expect Gary Kcrkorian to
wheel back for a pass and then
hand the porker to Bob Meyers on
a delayed trap play. That will be
crossing up the opposition all year.
It went for a score against San Jose.
Don't Forget the Odds
But remember that the Maize

and-Blue are a one-touchdown fa
vorite, and there are good reasons
for this. According to Ruetz, the
Wolverines have a better defense
thaji Stanford. Their pass defense is
tops, evidenced by the fact that
Michigan State only completed four
tosses last week.
Michigan has an Ail-American
tackle in Tom Johnson. The 225-
pound Negro was knocked cold in
the first quarter last week, and
his lass crippled the Michigan de
fense. But he will be in top shape
for the Cards.
The Mic'niganders possess one of
the best linebackers in the Big Ten
in Roger Zatkoff. Ruetz estimates
that Zatkoff made 60 per cent of
the Wolverines' tackles
Zatkoff, successor as a linebacker to
the great Dick Kempthorri, ]?ias a
somewhat simplei' explanation thlif
the Killer Kempth6t*n on the*
success of his linebacking tactics.
Kcmpthorn said, "I looked for the
tip-offs, I let the decoys go by—l
concentrated on the ball."
Zatkoff said, "I just see them
coming ... I hit them."
Perry Is Top Threat
Michigan's top offensive threat is
Lowell Perry, who plays end on
offense and safety on defense. Per
ry, a very lithe pass receiver, will
test the Card pass defense to the
fullest.
The hosts will start a backfield
of captain Bill Pitich at quarter
back, Don Oldham at left half,
Frank Howell at right half, and Tom

Witherspoon at the all - important
