TOKYO, Friday, Oct. s—Vicious
Chinese counterattacks up to regi
mental strength drove United Na
tions forces back in at least two
places today and virtually stalled
the five-division Allied limited of
fensive.
The 100,000 - man UN attacking
force heat back most of the Red
attacks and strove to push forward
in the three-day-old autumn offen
sive under some of the heaviest
Communist and Allied mortar and
artillery barrages of the war. The
Allies also threw a near - record
weight of armor into the furious
battles.
