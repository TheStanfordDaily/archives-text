## 'Syncopated Music' 
### 
To the Editor:
May I register a mild protest about the article in
Wednesday's Daily announcing the meeting of Stan
ford's Jazz Club? It is completely inaccurate and
unjustifiably condescending to classify jazz among
"the faster types of popular music," both because jazz
tempos are not necessarily fast and because jazz i*-
most decidedly not "popular music," in the usual
sense of that phrase. Conversely, the loud. fast, bouncy
tunes which pass for "hot" music on the radio and
jukeboxes are most decidedly not jazz.
Jazz music is a native American art form, and as
such has received more than its share of the oppro
brium incurred by all new and radically different
forms of artistic expression—in America and else
where.

Part of the abuse and condescension heaped upon
jazz may be traced to its humble origins among a
captive people in a strange land. Also—and unfor
tunately—jazz is often thought of solely as the musical
expression of the Roaring Twenties and is popularly
associated with speakeasies, bathtub gin. and loose
living in general. Well, it is true that some of the
musician-composers of jazz led lives that were a good
deal hotter than their music, but did Coleridge's ad
diction to drugs or the manner of Marlowe's death
affect the quality of "Chrisable" or "Dr. Faustus"?
If these comparisons seem absurdly pretentious, read
what Virgil Thomson and other distinguished musico
logists have written in praise of genuine jazz music.
And if you are interested in discovering for yourself
what many people consider to be America's outstand
ing (if not its only original) contribution to world art.
drop in to the Nitery some Wednesday evening.
