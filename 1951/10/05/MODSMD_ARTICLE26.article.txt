### DICK McLEAN 
". . . WITH DIGNITY AND DISCRETION"
What if Rossotti's locked the door and li;t the place
crumple naturally? What if the Sunday Night Flicks
were closed for good. What il the Men's Rooting Sec
tion were disbanded? The three campus outlets for
(■motion would be bottled up. The Health Service
would be swamped with students "in need of' psy
chiatric attention." And even more important, Stan
ford would lose three fine institutions which have pro
vided fun for the whole campus.
Fun should he just that—fun for everybody. But
if the few jokers, who must always top the other
guy, drive the fun to its limit and beyond, then the
enjoyment of all must cease.
The above might sound like an abstract Poli Sci

principle but it has some pretty
concrete meaning for all of us.
Let's take Rosotti's as an ex
ample. That wonderful old barn
with an icebox and garlic French
bread is an institution. In a sense
it is handed from one generation
to another. It seems to typlify the
spirit of the Stanford rough. Only
at Rossotti's can you walk over the
table il it's the shortest way out
the back door and to the right (or

left as the cast may be). Only at nossotu s can you
write on the walls or drink beer out of a quart bottle.
And despite its informal nature, you can still bring
a girl out there. It's been that way for a long time
and it's worth keeping that way.
But the clowns who tossed a few bottles through the
new owner's window the other night weren't thinking
of keeping Rossotti's fun. They thought they were
throwing touchdown passes. The dual entry heros who
try to drink the mostest and drive the fastest back
to campus are getting themselves up for a cracked head

and the campus in general for a black eye. These
clowns and jokers are in a small minority but that's
about all it takes to put out the lights for good at little
Hoover Tower at the head of Alpine Road.
The Sunday Night Flicks fall under the same
category as Rossotti's—good, unrepressed fun. In the
concealing darkness of Mem Aud the campus can
find relief in noisemakers. cheering for I. Stanford
Jolly, and other happy pastimes. But last Sunday
night a member of the liero (Jang dropped a fire
cracker over the balcony. It's useless to waste space
elaborating upon the dangers of this but if it's not
stopped, somebody will have to top the stunt with
something bigger and better. 'I he end of it all (and
all of us) will come with some gleeful idiot setting
off his homemade A-bomb. Even worse, there are
liable to be 110 more Sunday Night Flicks.
It became sport in the rooting section to start pelting
the Gremlin salesmen with scraps of paper because
they wouldn't take off their green„smocks. It seemed
fun until the joker wadded up a half-filled Gremlin
cup and hit an elderly salesman on the cheek. Sug
gestion for week after next: Bring a gallon jug of
water to the game because the Men's Rooting Section
can jolly well perish of thirst as far as the frozen
orange men are concerned.
The only solution to these Stanford problems, large
and small, lies with each of us. If we want to keep
these institutions, we've got to keep the clowns and
heros "shaped up." For if each one of us doesn't
cure enough to put the offenders back in line, then
we might as well close up shop quietly and tiptoe
over to the health service.
I once read a quotation from an Arabic poet of the
15th century. It went:
"Walk where thou wilt, my son.
But walk always with dignity and discretion."
It's not a half bad motto for 1951. Not bad at all.
