The Daily is printing in full, at Ex coin's request, so
that students may share in Phil's report of his ex
periences abroad.
Bonn, den 29. September 1951
My friends:
This is the first of the monthly "reports" which I
shall submit to you describing the work I do in
Europe and the impressions I receive from this
experience in Germany as a holder of an ASSU
Scholarship on the Free University of Berlin. It is
my hope that in this way you will derive some value
from sending me abroad—some current contact with
conditions as they exist here.
First off. I wish to thank you sincerely for giving
me this unforgettable opportunity of seeing Europe
and studying in Berlin, focal point of East-West con
flict in Europe. Only by actually living among foreign
people for a fairly long period is it at all possible to
glean an understanding of foreign character, mentality,
or way of life. By talking with various groups and
individuals here I hope to learn to know a bit about
how Europeans think and feel with reference to certain
political, social and ecoonmie questions—questions of
extreme importance for Americans. Later in life. too.
I shall endeavor to put into practice what 1 have
learned here. It will require much time, but if you
maintain this foreign scholarship effort, the number of
students who have "experienced' a foreign way of life
will greatly increase and in the end they will do their
part in bringing about a little more trust among peoples
of the world.
So far I have been through England. Scotland.
France, Belgium, Netherlands, and now I am in
Germany. It has been a most interesting trip. \ly
aim has lieen not only to see the old buildings and
storied places, but more to talk to different people.
I have spoken with labor union leaders, directors of
large businesses, clergymen, radio station and news
paper managers, students, and government and paii>

leaders. Without exception they have been extremely
hospitable ami eager to explain their work and offer
any assistance I needed. It is indeed a wonderful
feeling to be so received.
Along the way in Paris. I saw Dot Thomas, from last
year's Excom. who will study at University of Edin
burgh. I have also spoken with officials in three nations
who run the Fulbright Commissions. The ASSU For
eign Scholarship Committee always works closely with
these Commissions in order to obtain Federal Govern
ment travel grants under the Fulbright Act for our
foreign scholars. Our program has a wonderful repu
tation in Europe and the Commissions gave me much
useful information and expressed the desire to work
more closely in the future with the ASSU. There is no
other Foreign Scholarship Program for Europeans
which is so highly rated as ours.
In Paris also. 1 was invited to dinner by Mrs. Afana
cieff, mother of Olga Afanacieff, one of our scholars
this year from Paris. This lady was very kind to me
and I cannot forget this genuine friendship. In the
Hague I met Bob Van Dijl, ASSU Foreign Scholar
1948-49 from the Netherlands. He is doing work now
which has a direct relation to obtaining greater in
ternational understanding.
But above all. I am particularly greatful to Hella
Keglin my counterpart from the Free University of
Berlin. She and I are exchange students under the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Program. She most help
fully gave me the names of numerous important
friends of hers—people who have gone out of their
way to make my trip in Europe more meaningful.
I am sure that Hella will l>e most successful at Stan
ford. as she seems to be the type we are seeking.
As yet I have only very superficial impressions of
Germany. There are of course many difficult problems
facing the Western Powers and Germany in Europe.
In my next letter I'll try to examine some of these for
you.
1 want to express again my gratitude to you for this
opportunity of studying in Germany. I shall try to be
worthy of it. Many best wishes for a very happy and
successful year for the ASSU.
Yours as ever,

which has a direct relation to obtaining greater in

But above all. I am particularly greatful to Hella

I am sure that Hella will l>e most successful at Stan

As yet I have only very superficial impressions of

The Daily is printing in full, at Ex coin's request, so
that students may share in Phil's report of his ex
periences abroad.
Bonn, den 29. September 1951
My friends:
This is the first of the monthly "reports" which I
shall submit to you describing the work I do in
Europe and the impressions I receive from this
experience in Germany as a holder of an ASSU
Scholarship on the Free University of Berlin. It is
my hope that in this way you will derive some value
from sending me abroad—some current contact with
conditions as they exist here.
First off. I wish to thank you sincerely for giving
me this unforgettable opportunity of seeing Europe
and studying in Berlin, focal point of East-West con
flict in Europe. Only by actually living among foreign
people for a fairly long period is it at all possible to
glean an understanding of foreign character, mentality,
or way of life. By talking with various groups and
individuals here I hope to learn to know a bit about
how Europeans think and feel with reference to certain
political, social and ecoonmie questions—questions of
extreme importance for Americans. Later in life. too.
I shall endeavor to put into practice what 1 have
learned here. It will require much time, but if you
maintain this foreign scholarship effort, the number of
students who have "experienced' a foreign way of life
will greatly increase and in the end they will do their
part in bringing about a little more trust among peoples
of the world.
So far I have been through England. Scotland.
France, Belgium, Netherlands, and now I am in
Germany. It has been a most interesting trip. \ly
aim has lieen not only to see the old buildings and
storied places, but more to talk to different people.
I have spoken with labor union leaders, directors of
large businesses, clergymen, radio station and news
paper managers, students, and government and paii>

leaders. Without exception they have been extremely
hospitable ami eager to explain their work and offer
any assistance I needed. It is indeed a wonderful
feeling to be so received.
Along the way in Paris. I saw Dot Thomas, from last
year's Excom. who will study at University of Edin
burgh. I have also spoken with officials in three nations
who run the Fulbright Commissions. The ASSU For
eign Scholarship Committee always works closely with
these Commissions in order to obtain Federal Govern
ment travel grants under the Fulbright Act for our
foreign scholars. Our program has a wonderful repu
tation in Europe and the Commissions gave me much
useful information and expressed the desire to work
more closely in the future with the ASSU. There is no
other Foreign Scholarship Program for Europeans
which is so highly rated as ours.
In Paris also. 1 was invited to dinner by Mrs. Afana
