University's Philosophy Depart
ment. and Dr. Arthur Wright, pit)-

seminar, which also includes repre
sentatives from Asiatic and Slavic

ver Institute.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, scholars are
at work under a Rockefeller Foun
dation Grant, to translate further j
portions of Dr., Nakamura's books j
into English.

ford's Asiatic and Slavic Studies j
Department.
