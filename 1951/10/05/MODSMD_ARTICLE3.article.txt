# Reds Choose Site

TOKYOâ€”Gen. Matthew B. Ridg
way left it up to the Communist
high command in Korea today to
name an acceptable site for re
sumption of the stalemated truce
talks.
Ridgway, acting with record
speed in an overnight exchange of
notes, invited the Red leaders to
name their own neutral conference
site "'acceptable to me," after the
Communists had rejected his ear
lier suggestion of a move to Song
hyon-Ni. The Reds also blamed the
44-day break in the talks on United
Nations "violations of the Kaesing
neutral zone."
