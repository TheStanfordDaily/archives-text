# JV Gridders To Go Against Alameda NAS
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's junior varsity foot
ball team will be going for its
second straight win of the 1951
season when they meet Alameda
NAS this afternoon at 3. The
game will be played at Alameda.
The Flyers have so far maintained
a record of two wins and two
losses. They have downed Hamil
ton Field, 33-14, and San Francisco
Presidio, 38-14, while losing to Cas
tlemont AC, 20-13, and the Cal
Ramblers, 27-6. The Stanford JV's
beat Hamilton Field, 40-6, in their
only game of ihe season.
The key to Alameda's offensive
power lies in the passing of quar
terback Tom Ripia and the quick,
break - away running of halfback
Jarvel Nunez, well known among
residents of the Bay Area. Stanford
Coach Bob Ghilotti says he expects
the Flyers to throw the ball quite
a bit. mixing in the running to a
moderate degree.
The Braves will counter with
the passing of Jack Bickel and the
nnining of Bob Stewart and the
Anderson bovs, Bill and Mike.
Bickel, a junior, played on both
the Braves and the varsity in
1949. and in the 1950 final spring

practice scrimmage showed signs
of greatness. He is a sharp passer
who mixes his plays very well.
On the offensive line, Coach Ghi
loUi has such stalwarts as Don
Mueller, a senior guard of two years
of JV experience, Doug Pinto, out
standing junior end, and Tom Ro
mano, tackle, who was co-captain
of the 1949 freshman team, and a
varsity member last year.
Anchor man of the defensive team
will be 250-pound Len Kaprielian, a
junior who plays middle guard on
Coach Ghilotti's five-man line. In
the defensive backfield, John Gil
more. of last year's freshman team,
Bob Hoegh. a converted end and a
junior, and Scotty McKay, veteran
.safety man, will carry most of the
load. A real "sleeper" is Imre
Weitzner, freshman defensive end
from New York. • Weitzner, who is
recovering from a broken wrist, will
turn out for football on Monday.
Me won All-City honors two years
in a row at Horace Mann High
School in New York.
