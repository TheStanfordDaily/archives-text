NEW YORK, Oct. 4 (LP)—Ob
scure Dave Koslo started the
story-book New York Giants off
in quest of a new miracle today
when he pitched them to a bis
upset 5 to 1 victory over the New
York Yankees before (>5.<>73 fans
at Yankee Stadium in the first
game of the 1951 Yy'orld Series.
Ko.?lo, who has been a Giant since
1941, longer than any player on the
roster, combined a slow - breaking
curve and bomb-sight control for a
seven-hit victory.
Upsetting the odds in the same

manner ihey drove the experts
crazy down the stretch run in their
fantastic National Leagu# finish,
the jaunty Giants mauled no-hit
hero Allie Reynolds as if he had
been a third-rate pitcher for a sec
ond - division outfit in their own
league.
Alvin Dark, the slick shortstop
frcm the Louisiana bayou country,
who hit a three - run homer, and
Monte Irvin, the Jersey jolter, who
paced the Giants at bat all season,
emerged as the hitting heroes in
this latest conquest.


DOUBLE DUTY MAN —Lowell
