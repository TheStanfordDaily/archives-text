# Card Soccer Men Open With Rams
## 
### 
Coach Russ Latham's soccer stal
warts open their 1951 season tomor
row morning against the City Col
lege of San Francisco Rams. Kick
off time will be at 10 a.m. on the
Stanford soccer field.
The Cards began practices this
fall with better material than seen
on the Farm in many a year. Prac
tices at first were sluggish, but the
team has picked up speed in its de
velopment, culminating in a swift,
hard game - style scrimmage Wed
nesday afternoon.
While a definite favorite cannot
be picked, because the Rams are an
unknown quantity, Stanford, off
this week's practice sessions, should
give a creditable showing of itself.
