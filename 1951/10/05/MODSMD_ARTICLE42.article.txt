# 'Little Man' on Campus
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
If you think the Stanford In-,
dian looks like Worthal and his
opponents like Professor Snarf
in this fall's Daily football car-1
toons, dont' be upset.
Dick Bibler, who draws the "Little ;
Man on Campus" cartoons for 21 daily j
and 96 weekly school papers, is now 1
studying at Stanford's Graduate j
School of Art and Architecture. And |
besides doing his regular syndicated
series, he is doing the football art and |
"Sportraits" exclusively for The
Daily.

The blond cartoonist moved into
a Stanford Village apartment about
two weeks ago with his pretty wife
Carolyn and three-months-old baby
daughter. He is working for a Stan
ford M.A. in order to teach art.
Last year he studied education at
Colorado State College, and the
year before he received the Master
of Fine Arts from the University of
Kansas.
It was at KU that "The Little Man
on Campus" first saw the light of
Hay. After a stretch in the Seventh
Army Airways Communication Sys
tem during World War 11, Bibler
started college in 1946. As the win
ner of a drawing contest, he be
came the cartoonist for the Daily
Kansan, and then proceeded to cre
ate Worthal.
The campus scapegoat is actu
ally a sort of composite, Bihlcr
explains. To make Worthal's face,
the cartoonist drew 14 different
characters, then took "the most
stupid - looking features" from
each one and combined them.
Gordon A. Sabine, who now
teaches journalism at the University
of Oregon, suggested the title "Little
Man on Campus." "Everyone talks
about the wheels—the big men on
campus," Bibler comments. "The
Little Man" is just the opposite.
Worthal is supposed to be someone
anyone can feel sorry for.
Searching for an unusual name,
Bibler came up with "Worthal".—
closely related to "worthless."
"Professor Snarf" was just a

name he'd heard and considered
apt.
From rough penciled sketch to
finished India ink drawing, the ac
| tual cartoons take Bibler only about
an hour to draw. The ideas are
something else again.
Because he does the cartoons a
year in advance, he plans an over
all program according to the school
seasons: registration, football, bas
ketball, and so forth. Then he goes
over such possible idea sources as
school catalogues. Once the ideas
start to come, they arrive in clus
ters, he reports. And getting to
work again after several weeks'
rest is really hard.
Complying with demands from
his client - papers poses another
problem. Some schools say "no
drinking, no sex"; others, "we're
a boys' school — no cartoons

I showing girls in classes." One
I school wanted nothing hut sex.
Bibler answers most queries by
I suggesting that the papers use only
i those they want from among his
complete series, reasoning that
| semi - weekly and weekly papers
I will have plenty of cartoons to
choose from and that dailies are big
enough to afford being selective.
Bibler laughingly recalls some of
his readers' complaints. In Kansas
he drew a round of fire for a cartoon
showing basket - bearing Student
Union cooks going from garbage can
to garbage can commenting, "I don't
believe the fraternities are feeding
us as well as they used to."
Readers protested, "We like the
j Student Union. Bibler should apol
j ogize." The drawing was even con
-1 demned as an example of the Daily
s Kansan's "yellow journalism."
Bibler says he doesn't feel he's
been at Stanford long enough to
pass judgment on how "funny" it
is, how good a source it is of car
toon ideas. Amusing incidents
come up at all schools, he pointed
' out, but the problem is to weed
i out those with purely local ap
' peal.
One experience did provide pos
sible inspiration, however. He says
that after receiving a parking ticket
on one of his first days here, he may
do a cartoon of a policeman putting
branches over a "No Parking" sign
to hide it from the unsuspecting
motorist.


LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS—Dick Bibler, who draws the Wor
thal and Professor Snarf cartoons which appear in The Daily and
; 116 other college newspapers across the nation, is now at Stan
ford working for an M.A. in order to teach art. He has attended
i Colorado State College and the University of Kansas, where he
first got the idea to draw "Little Man on Campus.' '
