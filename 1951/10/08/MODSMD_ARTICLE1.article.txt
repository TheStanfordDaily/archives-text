## 
### PETE GROTHE 
(Sports reporter Grothc flew to
Ann A.bor to get this first-hand
report of Saturday's game for The
f)ail v.)
ANN ARBOR. Mich., Oct. 6—
A new Stanford football team j
was revealed here today.
Gary Kerkorian passed like
he has never passed before and
Bill McColl caught like he has
never caught before as a reju-!
venated team racked up favored
Michigan, 23 to 13, before 57,200

thoroughly unhappy Michigan
ders.
The Card triumph marked not
only the first time a Stanford team
has beaten Michigan, but also the
fir»t time a West Coast team has
ever prevailed over the Wolverines.
The chauvinistic Midwestern
ers, who believe thtit the West
Coast is still undeveloped In
dian country and can't produce a
decent football team, had to be
shewn—and they were.
They were shown a cohesive
football machine that literally ex
ploded in the second quarter for 20
points.

They were shown a 21-year
old, 182 - pound quarterback
named Kerkorian who deciphered
weak chinks in the Michigan ar
mor and stabbed away at those
chinks unmercifully and utterly
successfully.
They were shown the best end in
America who made seven sensa
tional catches for 142 yards. The
catches had to be sensational. Ev
ery time McColl would go out for
j an aerial, he would be bumped at
the line of scrimmage, and then two
men would guard him. The Maize
i and-Blue came to the conclusion
j that there was simply no defense
! that would stop the 225- pound San

I Diegan.
I They were shown a pass de
fense that allowed four comple
tions in 17 attempts and a passer
| (Kerkorian again) who connected
with 13 out of 21 for 20l> yards.
In short, they were diown a team
that cannot be counted out of the
Rose Bowl race.
But they had to wait to be shown.
1 The whole first quarter Stanford
followed the same script they used
in the Oregon and Ssn Jose con
tests. An untimely Indian fumble
put the Cards in a hole, and the
bulk of the first quarter was spent
keeping the Wolverines away from
the door.

With two minutes remaining in
the first quarter, the hosts pulled
out their welcome mat and sent end
Ixiwell Perry scooting three yards
i on an end-around for the score. A
29-yard pass from quarterback and
captain Bill Putich to end Fred Pi
chard highlighted the drive.
End Jack Rye smashed in to
block Russ Resci rla's conversion
try. and this was the point where
j Chuck Taylor's crew threw away
the old script and became the
'"new" Stanford football team.
Speed merchant Bobby Bryan ac
cepted the kick-off near the goal
I and proceeded to the Stanford 35.
Kerkorian announced his future in

| tentions by wheeling back and hit
: ting Mr. McColl yvith a 30-yard
heave. Big Bill lateraled to light
1 half Eric Southwood, who was
; knocked out of bounds on the 30.
Two plays lost two yards, and
then Kerkorian shot an 18 - yard
bullet pass to McColl, who caught
the oval completely off balance be
tween two defenders. He regained
| his balance and moosed eight yards
to the seven.
And here was fullback Bob Moy- I
ers smashing three yards off right
i tackle and then another half-yard
| on second down. And it was Mey
ers again, twisting, squirming,
; fighting his way to the one - foot i

line. Fourth down, and Michigan
put all its strength in the middle of
the line for another Meyers smash.
This was the set-up for the
mi»-t beautifully executed decep
tion Stanford has pulled in three
years. Meyers boomed up the
m'ddle into a big pile, and the
rcf, noticing that he had barely
squeezed past the goal line, raised
his hands to siffnify a touchdown.
"Then he suddenly dropped his
hands. Meyers didn't have the
ball.
The lx.ll was in the possession of
Kerkorian, who bootlegged and ef
fortlessly loped over the goal with
out a defender within ten yards of

him. Kerkorian converted out of
Harry Hugasian's hold, and thai
was the last time that Michigan was
to lead.
The Wolverines received the
kirkoff. couldn't do anything, and
kicked dead onto the Stanford 18.
It took the kids from the Farm
exactly nine plays to drive 82
yards for their second TD. The
high spots of the drive wire a 28-
yard pass to end Sam M or ley and
I a 16-yard reception McC'oJl made
with Perry and linebacker Roger
ZatkofY hanging on his hack.
Aiter a 26 - yard toss to McColl
