# Veterans' Checks Might Be Delayed
## 
### 
Veterans' subsistence checks may
be delayed for several months, the
Veterans Administration announced
yesterday.
The administration warned GI
students that payment of checks
would be tied up and that the stu
dents should have sufficient cash re
serves to tide them over.
Explanation of the cut - off of
funds was not made clear by the
VA. The VA did point out, how
ever, that the checks would further
be delayed if the administration's
clerical force was swamped with
letters of complaint.
The administration emphasized
that the delay in checks will not
prevent eligible veterans from en
rolling in class.
