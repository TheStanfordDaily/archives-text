### 
Interfraternity Council elected
] Bob Morris, Theta Chi; Don Sutton,
Sigma Nu; and Dick Leonard, Al
pha Delta Phi, as its representa
| tives -at - large on Interfraternity
j Board of Control, at its first meet
j ing of the quarter last Thursday
night.
In other business, the Council,
composed of the presidents of Stan
ford's 24 fraternities, clarified the

rushing rules especially in regard to
second- and third-quarter frosh.
It reaffirmed its stand taken last
spring that any man who does not
have 45 Stanford units or the cquiv
! alent may not be rushed until the

j regular winter quarter open-rush
j ing period. No social contact may
be had between the fraternities and
j these men.
However. Council President Tony
[ Garrett was quick to reassure all
j freshmen ' not to shy away from
| normal contact with fraternity men
i in activities and classes."
Three requests for housing off
| campus visitors were put irt the
: council members. Two, one from
Cardinals and one from the Debate
I Society, were accepted and the third
j was referred to the individual
i houses for consideration.
The third was for housing four
members each from the UCLA band
next Friday night, so that the band
! could be here for the float parade.
Feeling was that perhaps the bur
! den might be too great on the
! houses' facilities, especially since
they are already planning to host
members of their UCLA chapters.
However, a definite refusal was not
! stamped on the request.
A proposal for an interfraternity
' dance to be held winter quarter was
brought up but earmarked for dis
cussion and planning at the next
meeting of the council.
