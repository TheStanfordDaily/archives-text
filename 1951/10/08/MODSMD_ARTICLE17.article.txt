## 
### 
The Associated Students of |
the University of California Ex- j
ecutive committee last week
gave full support to a resolution !
opposing the proposed Berkeley i
city ordinances banning street j
meetings and sound trucks.
The proposed ordinance would re
quire a police permit and a SlO de
posit in order to have a street rally,
parade, or use a loud speaking sys
tem. There are also certain areas in
which these are forbidden, includ
ing the two popular campus rally
spots, Sather Gate and West Gate.
Doug Higgins, graduate representa- .
tive, introduced the motion to defeat {
the ordinance on September 28. which j
brought forth strong objection from I
Dean of Students, H. E. Stone.
Higgins pointed out that because
of University Rule 17. forbidding j
political speeches on campus,
'Sather Gate and West Gate have 1
become the traditonal places for i
students to hear "a varied expres
sion of political ideas."
Stone gave statistics regarding,
meetings held at Sather Gate during j
the past year as: "one meeting of the |
Young Republicans, one by five other j
organizations, and 24 by two organi
zations. both on the Attorney Gen- |
eral's list of subversive and Com- >
munist controlled groups."
