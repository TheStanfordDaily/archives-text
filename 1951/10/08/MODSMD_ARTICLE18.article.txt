# Ridgway Gets Red Assent To Move Peace Talk Site
## Commies Send Five Proposals 
### 
TOKYO, Monday, Oct. 8 (UP)
—Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway to
day received a grudging and
half-hearted Communist agree
ment to his demand that the
stalemated Korean truce talks bo
moved from Red-held and in
cident-ridden Kaesong.
But the Rods proposed the mud
village of Pan Mun Jom—still in the
fringes of their lines—rather than t.h
no-man's-land town of Songhyon
which Ridgway had urged. And the
Communists demanded an enlarge
ment of the "neutral zone" to include
Munsan. the United Nations advanre
"peace" camp. 10 miles inside United
Nations lines.
It was immediately noted that, ex
panding the present neutral area to
three times its present size, as pro
posed by the Reds, would multiply
rather than reduce the chances for
"incidents" such as those the Com
munists repeatedly charged again;-.*
U.N. forces at Kaesong.
The Communist message to Ridg
way made five proposals:
I—That truce negotiations resume
"promptly" at Pan Mun Jom.
2 —That the new conference neutral
area "he extended in a rectangular
shape" to includr hoth Kaesong in
'Communist-held territory, and Mun
san. 10 miles inside U.N. lines and
south of the Imjin River.
3 —That both sides assume respon
sibility for "protecting" the confer
ence site.
4—That U.N. and Communist liai
son officers meet to discuss reconven
ing the conference "if you (Gen.
Ridgway) agree."
s—That the first meeting of the full
armistice delegations set up the ma
chinery for extending and safeguard
ing the neutral area.
