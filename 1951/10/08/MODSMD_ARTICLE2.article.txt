## 'Allies Will Fight Until Reds Have Enough,' Says Van Fleet 
### 
TOKYO, Monday, Oct. H (UP)—
The United Nations crushing ofTen- j
sive ground steadily forward in east
and west Korea against bitter, stub- i
born resistance today, and an Al- 1
lied briefing officer said the Allied
attacks were "beginning to hurt the
enemy."
Gen. James A. Van Fleet, com- |
mander of the Eighth Army, said, I
"There will be additional phases (of !
the oflensive) until the Chinese
'volunteers' and the North Koreans
have had enough of it."
The thunderous, methodical au
tumn offensive achieved its greatest j
success on the flaming east front ;
where U.S. and French infantrymen :
battled their way to the top of "Kim
II Sung" peak against furious Chi- !
nose Red resistance.
Heavy fighting was also reported ,
where troops of the U.S. Second Di- j
vision launched an assault on the •
last Communist-held hill of "Heart- j
break Ridge" and other units slug- '
ged their way to the gates of the j
Mundung Valley, strategic Red j
build-up area beyond the ridge.
In western Korea where heavy I
censorship veiled the Allied attacks, j
the First Cavalry Division captured j
three of its five assigned objectives ,
in bitter fighting. One unit took '
"Bloody Baldy," a dominating peak,
three times only to lose it to coun- j
terattacks. The fourth Allied attack
was successful.
