# The 						Maroon Has Troubles
## 
### 
The University of Chicago announced Thurs
day night that it had fired the editor of the
Chicago Maroon, student newspaper, for at
tending the Communist-sponsored East Berlin
youth festival this summer. Publication of The
Maroon has been suspended indefinitely.
Maroon staff members are fighting back. The
Daily received the telegram printed below yes
terday:

"Please wire support" says the telegram, but
how can anyone support or deny support to
a cause when all the facts are not known? If
Editor Kimmel was ousted for attending or
sponsoring the rally as an individual, then it
would seem to us that the University of Chi

cago was on dangerous ground indeed in or- j
dering the suspension. More important would I
be whether or not Kimmel was giving adequate 1
space to all sides and was editing a newspaper
rather than a propaganda sheet.
Some persons at Stanford, particularly those
who knew Chicago Chancellor Laurence Kimp
ton when he was dean of students here, think
there is more to the Maroon's troubles than
meets the eye.
The business of campus newspaper suspen- !
sions has been popping up with regularity of I
late. Last winter the Daily Bruin at UCLA had
troubles with the student executive board, not
university officials, and the staff quit in protest
over editorial appointments.
Just last spring the University of Washington
Daily editor was suspended early in his term
for not giving adequate news coverage to the !
campus. The editor had devoted a great deal
of space to attacking a Washington state anti
subversive bill.
Now comes the Maroon suspension. Either
editors are becoming less responsible or uni
versity officials are getting too jumpy.
At any rate, The Daily will withhold com
ment on the Chicago case until we get definite
answers to the many unanswered questions.
Queries have been sent to both Kimpton and
the Chicago Maroon.
