### PETE GROTHE 
GRIDDERS HAVE "NEW LOOKS"
The Stanford gridders have a "new look" this year,
: iid I'm not referring to the new red devil pajamas
they romp around in on Saturdays. No, it's the
pleasant expressions on their faces in the printed foot
ball programs.
Times used to be when a kickballer would contort
every muscle in his face and give out with an aeoniz-

iri-i expression that would horrify
the most calloused Boris Karl off
lan. The picture just wasn't con
sidered good unless it resembled
a cross between Mighty Joe Young
and the Big Bad Wolf.
Enterprising photogs would have
h;11! backs leap from Hoover Tower
so they could get a good shot of
them straight-arming the atmos
phere. For effect, you know.
1 must say the change is a

welcome one. Now, our footballers look like normal
red-blooded Amercan youths . . . the kind of guys
who love their mothers, ),'<> to church on Sundays,
r.ild pet stray doj;s. And, besides Don Liebcndorfer's
program doesn t look like a billboard for a Franken
stein movie any more.
« # ii<
And now a word of explanation is in order. In last
Thursday's Bull Session, I mentioned that this journal
ism racket is rough, partly because of punchlines

being mangled. So what happens? The proof readers
effected the most complete butchering since 20,000
heads were guillotined in the French Revolution.
Many lines were put in inverted order and the lines
of one ditty were completely snafued. And so for
the benefit of those who looked at me out of the
corners of their eyes as I walked down the Quad,
here's how it goes (to the tune of The Cardinal is
Waving):
Pappy is crying all over the Held.
Kichter is moaning with a spirit that will not yield.
Sol)! Soh! Soh! Farewell old Berkeley.
You're in a hole,
Cause tliis year you can't go
To the Rose Bowl.

GRADUATION FLASHBACK. At the graduation
ceremonies last year, an elderly couple sat near the
back and watched the dark-robed graduated file
towards the stage.
Suddenly, the white-haired man grabbed his wife's
arm. "There he is. Ma, there's Bill Jr."
"Yes. said the frail lady, dabbing a hankie to her
eye. "there goes our G.OOO bucks down the aisle."
«* » # #
QUICK YUK. A friend of mine went to his prof
the other day to complain about his grade. "You really
don t think I deserve tliis grade, do you?" he com
plained."
"No." the prof answered, "but zero is the lowest
grade there is."

effected the most complete butchering since 20,000
heads were guillotined in the French Revolution.
Many lines were put in inverted order and the lines
of one ditty were completely snafued. And so for
the benefit of those who looked at me out of the
corners of their eyes as I walked down the Quad,
here's how it goes (to the tune of The Cardinal is
Waving):
Pappy is crying all over the Held.
Kichter is moaning with a spirit that will not yield.
Sol)! Soh! Soh! Farewell old Berkeley.
You're in a hole,
Cause tliis year you can't go
To the Rose Bowl.

GRADUATION FLASHBACK. At the graduation
ceremonies last year, an elderly couple sat near the
back and watched the dark-robed graduated file
towards the stage.
Suddenly, the white-haired man grabbed his wife's
arm. "There he is. Ma, there's Bill Jr."
"Yes. said the frail lady, dabbing a hankie to her
eye. "there goes our G.OOO bucks down the aisle."

QUICK YUK. A friend of mine went to his prof
the other day to complain about his grade. "You really
don t think I deserve tliis grade, do you?" he com
plained."
"No." the prof answered, "but zero is the lowest
grade there is."

GRIDDERS HAVE "NEW LOOKS"
The Stanford gridders have a "new look" this year,
: iid I'm not referring to the new red devil pajamas
they romp around in on Saturdays. No, it's the
pleasant expressions on their faces in the printed foot
ball programs.
Times used to be when a kickballer would contort
every muscle in his face and give out with an aeoniz-

iri-i expression that would horrify
the most calloused Boris Karl off
lan. The picture just wasn't con
sidered good unless it resembled
a cross between Mighty Joe Young
and the Big Bad Wolf.
Enterprising photogs would have
h;11! backs leap from Hoover Tower
so they could get a good shot of
them straight-arming the atmos
phere. For effect, you know.
1 must say the change is a

welcome one. Now, our footballers look like normal
red-blooded Amercan youths . . . the kind of guys
who love their mothers, ),'<> to church on Sundays,
r.ild pet stray doj;s. And, besides Don Liebcndorfer's
program doesn t look like a billboard for a Franken
stein movie any more.

And now a word of explanation is in order. In last
Thursday's Bull Session, I mentioned that this journal
ism racket is rough, partly because of punchlines

being mangled. So what happens? The proof readers
effected the most complete butchering since 20,000
heads were guillotined in the French Revolution.
Many lines were put in inverted order and the lines
of one ditty were completely snafued. And so for
