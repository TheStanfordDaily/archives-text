WASHINGTON. Oct. 7 — Demo
cratic National Chairman William
M. Boyle, Jr.. and GOP Chairman •
Guy George Gabrielson were urged
tonight to resign and help "restore
public confidence in the integrity of '
our national leaders and govern- j
ment officials."
The demand was made by Sen. J
Richard M. Nixon, R., Calif., a
member of the Senate's Permanent j
Investigating Committee which has
been checking into the activities of
Boyle and Gabrielson in connection
with loans made by the Reconstruc
tion Finance Corporation.
He added that in replacing Ga
brielson and Boyle, the Republicans j
and Democrats should "select as
their chairmen men who are in a j
position to profit neither directly !
nor indirectly from any dealings j
with the federal government."
