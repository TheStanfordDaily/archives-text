# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## M.E.'s AT DU PONT Diversity of chemical products spells opportunity for the mechanical engineer 
### 
Students of mechanical engineering
sometimes assume there is little op
portunity for them in the chemical
industry. In fields where products are
made in more or less standardized
equipment, this may he so.
But in a company like Du Pont
which operates in many fields of in
dustrial chemistry—where products
are made at pressures over 15,000
pounds per square inch as well as in
vacua low as two millimeters of mer
cury—mechanical engineers are in
heavy demand.
What jobs do they fill at Du Pont?
Literally hundreds, not including the
normal run of mechanical engineer
ing work such as design of standard
equipment, scaling up from blue
prints, etc.
For example, here are some of the
problems encountered in the manu
facture of nylon yarn alone:
1. Nylon polymer, a poor thermal
conduct or, is melted by a contact sur

face grid at 550° F. The polymer de
composes slowly at this temperature,
and there is a major heat-transfer
problem. Many types of melting grids
had to he designed before one proved
satisfactory.
1. The molten polymer is pumped to
spinnerets under pressures over JOOO
pounds per square inch. With nylon
as the only lubricant, the pumps must
operate continuously at 550° F. Spe
cialized problems in sealing, gasket
ing and materials of construction are
inherent in this operation.
3. The melt is forced through mul
tiple holes (diameters of 7 to 22 thou
sandths of an inch) in a special alloy
disc. They must be made to conform
to "jeweler's specifications."
4. The emerging fibers are cooled in a
specially designed "air conditioned"
chimney. Precise control is essential
in this critical operation.
5. The fibers are wound on spools at
surface speeds around 1000 yards per
minute. Design calls for constant
change in speed so that there is no
localized stretching or relaxation of
the fiber.
6. Finally, the fiber is drawn about
400% and wound on spools traveling
at 5000 feet per minute. Bearing lu
brication and dynamic balance pre
sented important design problems.
These are but a small part of the
mechanical engineering problems
arising in the manufacture of a single
product by only one of Du Font's ten
manufacturingdepart ments. Literally
hundreds of other products, ranging
all the way from cellulose sponges to
metals like titanium, present similar
challenges. So long as new processes
continue to be sought and old proc
esses improved, there will be impor
tant work for the hand and mind of
the mechanical engineer.
