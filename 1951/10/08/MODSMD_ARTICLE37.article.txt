# WOULD SERIES
## Durocher Bemoans Rain; Stengel Readies Yanks 
### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 7 (UP)—Mana
ger Casey Stengel, conceding that
today's rain-out was a break for the
Yankees, growled tonight that his
defending world champions had j
been shaken out of their complacent j
mood and "would go out there and
take this series back from the Gi- !
ants."
Stengel, obviously angered at the
Yankees' performances in the first
three games, still was talking about
Eddie Stanley's "five-run field goal" \
which opened the gates for the Gi
ants' big rally yesterday and almost !
put Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto
out of the series.
"See this," the angry Stengel said, :
pointing to a gaping hole in his 1
bridge work. "I lost this when a !
guy tagged me coming itno second
base and that's the way Rizzuto
should have'tagged Stanley."
"They knew the name of the '
man." Stengel continued. "They
knew he would be riding in hard ;
and they should have been ready, i
They will be from now on."
Stengel made no secret of his joy
over the postponement. He revealed
that he would have pitched rookie
Tom Morgan instead of the an- j
nounced Johnny Sain today and I
then announced that Allie Reynolds
would be his pitcher in the fourth
game.
"It's Reynolds," Stengel said. "The j
rain gives us a break. Now we can j
come back with the Chief."

NEW YORK, Oct. 7 (UP)—A
glum Leo Durocher, looking as if
someone had thrown a wet blanket
over his baseball party, expressed |
fear that today's rain could cool off j
his red-hot New York Giants.
"I would have just as soon played
today." he mumbled unhappily as 1
he watched a steady rain beat '
against the window of his clubhouse j
office.
"There's no telling what this rain j
might do," he added, gritting his j
teeth so that he appeared far more
tight and tense than at any time
since the World Series began.
"Baseball is a funny game," he |
sighed. "You might think either we I
or the Yankees will benefit from
today's postponement, but there's |
no way of telling which of us the
rain will help more.
"We weren't supposed to have the
advantage against Brooklyn, yet we
won; now, we're supposed to have
the advantage, but I don't know
what we really have."
Durocher stopped talking a mo
ment to glance toward his players,
who were idling in front of their
lockers. .
"This rain," he went on, "is sup
posed to help Koslo and Jansen. It's
supposed to give e'm more rest, but
you can bet it will Help Reynolds,
too."
