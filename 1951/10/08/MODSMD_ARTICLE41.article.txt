# Card Tankers Rack Bears, San Jose
## 
### 
The Stanford water polo team ,
splashed to easy wins over Cal and |
San Jose State in their opening
games last weekend. Bob Frojen, i
spectacular Card forward, plunked
in 12 goals in the two contents to
outscore the opposition singlehand
edly.
On Saturday, they opened the
conference season by dunking Cal 6
to 1. Stanford took a 4 to 1 lead in
the first quarter and was never
headed. All the scoring came in the
first half. Stanford's defense was
good and rough, and Cal resorted to
many desperation shots which goal-

Ie Russ Latelle harmlessly batted
aside. Frojen scored three goals, |
while Ash Jones, Bert Holliday, and
Jim Gaughram tallied one each.
Coach Haynie was naturally hap- j
py with his team's performance. He
singled out Frojen as outstanding, j
but he said that Bob Wycoff and
backs Bert Holiday and Ash Jones
also played standout ball. In fact,
he said that the whole team "played [
like a million dollars" and seemed a
cinch for no worse than second in
the PCC. Cal's JV's mauled Stan- '
ford's reserves 16 to 2 in a prelimi
nary battle.
On Friday the varsity waltzed to
a 13 to 4 triumph over San Jose
State. Frojen was held to nine goals

, by an alert Spartan defense. Coach
Haynie cleared the bench in an ef
fort to keep down the score, but it
was hopeless. Wycoff scored three
goals and Pete Cole tallied the re
maining one.
Next Saturday morning the PCC
; crown will probably be at stake
i when Stanford's outstanding club
meets UCLA's outstanding club at
i the local pools.
