"Left turn?"
"No, no, the score— Stanford's
ahead!"
Saturday afternoon San Fran
ciscans may have been sur
prised by a three-car procession
of cheering students. With Dick
Weisman in charge, eight Stan
ford foreign scholarship stu
dents toured the city.
En route to the points of interest,
everyone in the first car listened to
the Michigan game. Since the other
cars did not have radios the score
was relayed to them every five or
ten minutes.
The first stop was the /.on. After
a quick look at the animals, the
group proceeded to Golden Gate
Park, then lunched at a hamburger
stand at the beach.
At the restaurant there was a
good deal of discussion about the

| menu. In spite of the fact that all
of the foreign students could each j
speak several languages, no one !
could explain in Italian what a :
hamburger was. Audo Pollastri or
dered one anyway and to every- j
one's delight seemed to enjoy it.
After a brief stop at the Aquar- i
ium and the Natural History Mu
seum, the group visited the Oriental J
tea garden. Here, the Daily photog
rapher had a chance to take a pic- j
ture of the group assembled on an |
old Chinese bridge. At the De |
; Young Museum he took another
shot of three students grouped !
j around a statue. In fact, so many '
pictures were taken that there were
j several comments about ordering an |
album after the trip.
Fisherman's Wharf was another I
stop on the tour.
In the late afternoon, the three- I
car caravan drove across the Oak- j
land Bay Bridge for a quick inspec- I
tion of the University of California
j as the final stop before returning to j
! Palm Drive.
