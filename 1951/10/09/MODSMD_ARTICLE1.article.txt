## Ridgway Accepts New Truce Site 
### 
TOKYO. Tuesday, Oct. !» (UT) —
Gen Matthew B. Ridgway today
paved the way for United Nations
and Red liaison teams to meet
Wednesday morning (11 p.m. PST
Tuesday) in a now attempt to get
the .'nagged Korean truce talks go
in u again.
The Communists need only say
"yes" to R idgway's latest note to
end the 48-day breakdown in the
talks.
Presumably the Reds will agree,
although Ridgway turned down
their suggestion that the "Kaesong
neutral zone" be tripled in size and
extended 10 miles inside the United
Nations lines.
The United Nations supreme com
mander agreed to the Communist
proposal to move the conference
site from propaganda-blighted, Red
held Kaesong to the front-line vil
lage of Pan Mun Jom, and this con
cession was expected to be enough
to brinq the Communist liaison offi
cers to Wednesday's meeting.
