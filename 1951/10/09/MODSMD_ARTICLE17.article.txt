# Siren 'Busts' Into Quad

Who is the Mystery Girl current
ly driving Stanford roughs into im- 1
passioned spasms of frenzy and j
flushing the innocent and disillu- j
sioned taces of Stanford women
walking past. Geology corner?
Who is this girl—an obvious as- ;
sumption after viewing her — that J
has revolutionized the prchitccture I
of the Quadrangle, drained the Art j
Department's exhibit of visitors, anrl j
accumulated an unprecedented mini- !
her of loiterers around Geology cor- j
ner?
"Lewd Aggie" is her name, and
sullenly — perhaps sensuously — j
adorning the architectural relief of i
the Geology Department is her i
game. She is a store dummy, a girl
with golden hair and other femi
nine attributes, who resides in a j
niche on the southwest corner of
Quad.
The magnificent manikin lias re- i
mained in this prominent location j
since two Stanford men put her j
there last Thursday. Thev prefer to j
remain anonymous for obvious rea- !
sons. They also expressed fear of
incrimination for Communistic ac- j
tivities, because of their ample use |
of red paint, with which they deftly )
ornamented the store model.
It was an inside job. The two i
slipped cunningly into the Geology J
library at a time when no one was '
around, unlocked and opened the
window, climbed out on the ledge. I
and placed the dummy in its pres
ent position.
Some of the ecology majors have [
nicknamed the mystery nirl "Lewd
Aggie' in dubious honor of Louis
Agassi/, a famed naturalist whose j
bust was more conservatively ex- ;
hibitcd. The earthquake dislodged
Louis Agassi/.' bust, which crashed
to the pavement below. This i' the '
incident that prompted David Stan |

Jordan's now - famous comment:
"This is the first time Ix»uis Agassi*
has gone from the abstract to the
concrete."
This isn't the only time "Lewd
Aggie' has obsessed men and em
barrassed women from her cubby
hole. The same duo nut her there

last spring quarter, where she
stayed for h day and a half. The
two were dissatisfied with their
model, which they felt lacked at
traction. By the use of a blonde win
and a sailor's cap and neckerchief,
they have remedied this, as is plain

MYSTERY GlRL—"Lewd Aggie" rose to new ne:gnts this week
from high atop her perch on Geology Corner. Her impressive
form lent a new emphasis to the study of stone.
