TOKYOâ€”The entire Communist
defense line in Korea was knocked
off balance today by the impact of
the new United Nations offensive
which has chewed up 75 per cent
of the effective central front fighting
strength of the North Korean army.
Fighting some of the bloodiest
battles of the Korean war under an
artillery duel that reached unsur
passed proportions, the crunching
Allied drive rolled over five new
strategic hill positions Monday.
The pulverizing weight of the UN
assault was reported buckling the
North Korean lines in the "Heart
break Ridge" area of the east cen
tral front.
