# The 						Cellar and Nickel Coffee
## 
### 
One of Stanford's oldest, certainly one of its
most popular traditions — nickel coffee at the
Cellar—seems out of danger again, at least for
awhile.
For as long as most undergraduates can re
member, someone has been harping about
keeping the-Cellar area cleaned up, but the
harping seems always to have fallen on deaf
ears.
It was the old tune students had heard in
high school: "keep the campus clean" and
more than likely they resented it, and rightly so.
Then some of the Cellar personnel, and par
ticularly W. R. Gunther, who manages all
Stantord retail food units, came up with an
idea that apparently is working.
The signs in front of the Cellar this week put
the matter very bluntly. "Rudely" is the word
Gunther uses. In effect they said, "If the wrap

pers and coffee cups and half-eaten snails that
have-litlered the area aren't disposed of in the
more than ample trash cans, nickel coffee will
have to go."
It wasn't a matter of bribery. It was simple
arithmetic. The University couldn't continue
to pay porter's salaries to dispose of the rubble
students had left and continue to sell nickel
coffee.
Now, Gunther, pleased with students' co
operation, has removed the signs, believing
them no longer necessary. But the signs will
return if and when the cooperation fails. And if
the signs don't work, concealed watchers will
"call students" when they drop that coffee cup
and take off for their 10 o'clock.
This seems entirely unnecessary and bor
ders on the absurd. The watchdog principle
has never been popular heie. Let's keep
nickel coffee.—J.M.


CELLAR AREA was in bad shape when this wa> taken early last March. But the empty coffee
cups and sandwich wrappers that dot this picture no longer litter the front of the Cellar.
