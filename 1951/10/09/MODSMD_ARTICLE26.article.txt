### PETE GROTHE 
EIGHT O'CLOCK CLASS
At G:42 a.m. the sun tumbled over the crest of the
hills across the bay; squatted upon them momentarily
like a fried egg on a mound of mashed potatoes and
then proceeded along its upward, westwardly course.
For the astronomer and the night watchman, the dav
had begun. But the campus slept on.

This was the campus prihievil—
the squirrels frolicing unmolested
on Inner Quad, the doors to the li
brary bolted tight, the Cellar
standing barren and clean (even
the bees hadn't awakened yet),
;.nd the yellow sunlight bowling
silently down the vacant arch
ways.
Room 2.'11 in the History Cor
ner was vacant toa. The rows of
seats faced the podium, the

blackboard was clean, hut in a little booklet caneo a
Time Schedule someone had written "Room 2151.
M'TWThF, 8 o'clock—Prof. Snarf."
Professor Snarf's alarm clock was set for 6:45. As
the ticking bomb exploded and shattered his slumber,
he forgot where he was for a moment and burst out
anjrily, "All right, get out your paper. We're goim;
to have a little pop quiz." Then remembering he was
in bed, he sank back upon the pillow with the happy
vision of swollen-eyed students trying to make their
numb minds function. With a peaceful smile Pro
fessor Snarf went back to sleep mumbling. "Trace and
compare the social, economic, and political structure of
the . . ."
Over in Roble at 7 o'clock the only sound to dis
turb the peaceful morning was the dainty snoring of

die coeds. Suddenly an alarm clock clanged its raucous
"good morning." One little girl jumped out of bed
with an energetic bound and plunged 10 feet to the
stony, cold floor below. (She'd been dreaming of home
and forgotten she had a top bunk.) She got up .slowly
and dragged her bruised body in front of the mirror.
As she stood there with no make up, her hair in pin
curls, her face doughy from sleep, and all other beauty
aids lacking, she said, "It looks like this isn't your
day, old girl. Better go back to bed and give it an
other try."
The sleepy face in the mirror nodded its agreement
and the little freshman climbed up the rope ladder,
strapped herself in bed, and went back to her lady
like snoring.
Out at Stanford Village the paper-thin wall emitted
all the sounds of the morning at 7:30. The bells and
gongs and trampling feet filled the room of a sleeping
junior. He was long accustomed to the early rush to
breakfast and slept on. His alarm had a habit ol
clicking quietly one minute before it went off. He had
the habit of turning it off as soon as it clicked. And
thus the junior and his frustrated clock passed the
mornim; in a state of truce—the clock ticking sternly
and the junior giggling occasionally, at his dreams.
At 8 o'clock the bell in room 2wl sounded. But there
was no one there to come to attention. The rows and
the podium stared at one another vacantly. Only the
warmth of the sunlight filled the empty room.
And as one beam of light played across a desk, i(
caught a motto carved deep into the antique wood
The carving was old and splintered but the sentiment
was as fresh and bright as the sunlight.
The motto read:
To hell with 8 o'clock classes.
