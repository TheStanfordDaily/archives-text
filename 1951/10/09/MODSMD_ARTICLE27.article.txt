## Faulkner Employs Drama in 'Requiem' 
### DICK FREDELL 
Several times a year hooks of unusual interest are
published. Such a hook is "Requiem for a Nun."
William Faulkner's fiist work since winning the
Nobel I'rize.
"Hequiem" consists of a play, together with three
passages in which the historical background of Faulk
ner's mythical County is further de
veloped.
The play pick.-, up the character;, of "Sanctuary"
.iie years later. Temple Drake. thv young college girl
abducted by a gangster pervert, raped, and held captive
in a brothel, has now married Gowan Stevens, her
drunken escort on the day !>he was kidnapped. But
Templet still tied to her past, is now planning an elope
ment with the brother of her brothel "lover."
Nancy, the Nun of the title although she was a
Negro prostitute and dope fit ml until brought to he
maid and confidante for Temple in the Stevens man

to the murder of Temple's btihy. In so doing she
ln ings suffering to Temple, which prevents Iter from
thiing more evil.
'I he main body of the play concerns the frantic effort:

of Temple :ind her lawyer uncle to free the condemned
murderess. Actually, Temple's story—lust for a scoun
drel—cannot possibly save Nancy, but in telling il
Temple has at least draped her past into the open and
purged herself, the significance of which is perhap?
akin to Catholic confessional.
Obviously the shades of mind that motivate these
events are extraordinary, and the story's success rest
largely in giving Nancy the simple faith and eloquence
of a saint a nun—so that we can really believe she
acts mercifully, not merely insanely, in murdering tht
baby (who will go straight to heaven anyhow) to pie
vent Temple from totally destroying the family.
A trailing of the play leaves one wondering, hut the
limitations of the dramatic form in print are obvious.
Plays, after all. are to he played, not read.
As for the historical interludes, they are Faulkner
at his be: t, filled with profound, flowing prose, subtle
humor, and the pageantry, tragedy, and dignity e>l
Faulkner's South. Play and interludes may be read
apart from each other, but the interlude s "The Court
house." 'The Golden Dome," "The Jail" provide a
symbolic backdrop for the play that increases its ef
