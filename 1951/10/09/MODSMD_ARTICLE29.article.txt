Continuing their policy of publishing as many books as possible
which deal with national and international problems, the Stanford
University Press has just released its new fall catalogue. Follow
ing is a brief description of some of the more important publica
tions
"The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution," by Harold R. Isaacs,

describes how the Chinese Com
munists have been dominated by
Moscow as far back as 1925, and
how the Cominform motivated the
Revolution in 1927. Although this
book was originally published 13
years ago. this is a new edition
which brings the story of Commu
nist domination in China up to the
present time.
Twenty-six autobiographies of
tlie leading Chinese Communists
are presented in Nyni Wales' "Red
Dust." Miss Waels has talked in
timately with all of the Red lead
ers and she has compiled a careful
account in their own words as to
how they shifted to the Commu
nist party.
In the field of international poli
tics, "The Saar," by Frank M. Rus
sell, discusses the history of the vi
tal coal region so close to the Iron
Curtain. Mr. Russell tells how the
Saar basin has been tossed around
as a political football, and its im
portance in the field of international
co-operation.
A study of American strategy
in Guam and Micronesia is ex
plored in Earl S. Pomeroy's book
"Pacific Outpost." The importance
of these tiny atolls and how Amer
ica has utilized them as strategic
defense areas is recorded here.
In books dealing with other fields,
"The Policy Sciences," edited by
Daniel Lerner and Harold W. Lass
well, is a compilation of the scien
tific foundations upon which sound
national policies may be based. Sev
enteen prominent social scientists,
among them psychologists, anthro
pologists, sociologists, economists,
and political scientists, have com
piled this comprehensive volume.
An economic analysis of impor
tant commodities is discussed in V.
D. Wickizer's "Coffee. Tea, and Co
coa." Published in conjunction with

evry aspect of these constituents in
the diet of man.
Recording the "human side of
the Mexican Art Renaissance,"
Virginia Stewart has compiled in
her "45 Contemporary Mexican
Artists" some of the more impor
tant art works done by the artists
of our neighbor "south of the
border."
