(sifts Accepted
All those interested in making
gifts in connection with special
: projects, such as furniture or land
scaping, in the construction of the
Bowman Alumni House are asked
to communicate with Mrs. Gerbode
lin San Francisco or with Jack
Shoup, Alumni Director, on the
campus.
The total Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation membership is at an all
time high of more than 14,300. ac
cording to Joseph J. Burris, '36, of
the membership committee of the
board.
Rates to Increase
Burris further stated that before
the year is out an increase in the
life membership dues rate is ex
: pected to be announced, because of
increased costs and the steady ex
pansion of Association services.
The present rate was established
in 1947. Any increase in life mem
bership dues will be held, it is
hoped, to about 25 per cent.

Students are becoming increas
ingly prominent in the Alumni As
sociation, according to Swim. All
students are eligible to join the as
sociation as soon as they matricu
late at Stanford.
