# Bulletin Space Offers Problem
## 
### 
Excom has assigned to the ASSU
Public Relations Committee the job
of working with University officials
on problems involving University
bulletin boards.
Harvey Segall, chairman of the
Public Relations Committee, as
signed Charles ("Chuck") Denny,
committee staff member, to confer j
with Fred Glover, University direc
tor of information, concerning the j
problem of where students may
post non-official notices.
The problem came about through !
joint student - administration action
which led to a revision of bulletin i
board operations on the Quad. Re
cently glassed -in boards replaced '
those which were previously open to I
everyone. The new boards, now
serviced daily by the Public Exer
cises Committee, are limited to offi
cial ASSU and University notices i
and other information considered of j
general interest.
University officials, Segall re
ported, have agreed with Excom
that the new board installed at the
entrance to the Cellar is not suffi
cient for student needs.
