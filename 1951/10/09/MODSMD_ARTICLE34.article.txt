# Yanks Win; Even Series
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (UP)—Stung
ijy the tongue of boss Casey Sten
gel, who told thein to "start acting
like Yankees again," the slumping
sluggers went out and evened the
World Series at two games apiece
with a 12—hit, G to 2 victory over the
Giants behind superchief Allie Rey
nolds.
The Yankees on this bright blue
Monday, before 49,010 fans in the
Polo Grounds, suddenly took com
mand with their authority of old.
Even fading Joe DiMaggio brushed
the cobwebs off his bat and blasted
the day's most prodigious hit, a two
run fifth-inning homer far up into
the upper deck in left field.
Double Play Nips Giants
Reynolds, tiring in the ninth,
looked as if he might need some
help. Mindful of the way the Giants
had risen to the occasion in other
last-chance situations this season,
their hopeful supporters were spur
red to excitement when Hank
Thompson walked to start the last
inning and Monte Irvin singled him
to second with his second hit of the
game and his ninth of the series.
Whitey Lock man Hied out, but Bob
by Thomson shot a single to left to
Score Thompson.
Yankee hurlers were warming up
furiously at this time, but artful
Allie quit kidding around then.
Willie Mays, an All - American
"double out" all day, hit into his
third double play of the game to
end the uprising.
Yankees Bounce Back
The Yankees also snapped back
to life defensively today. They
played errorless ball and choked off
trouble on four occasions with daz
zling double plays, two of which
Reynolds started himself.
Against the supposedly fearsome
Giant ace, Sal Maglie, the Yanks
collected eight of their hits before
he gave up the ghost after the fifth
inning.
DiMaggio, who had been brood
ing over his frightful slump, came
out of it with a vengeance on his
home run in the fifth. He delivered
it after another slumper. Yogi Ber
ra. singled. That made it 4 to 1.
