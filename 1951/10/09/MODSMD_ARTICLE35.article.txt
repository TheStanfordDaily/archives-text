ALL 1 WANT FOB CHRISTMAS IS MY TWO .
During a fourth quarter timeout in the Michigan game, defensive tackle
Al Kiikland was conducting a furious search. Kirkland was scanning the
grass when trainer Connie Jarvis, he of the bow tie, came by and asked.
"What are you looking for, Al?"
"Help me look for it, Connie, I can't find my front tooth."

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE UCLA. Many seem to hold the opinion
that Stanford beat a second-rate club when they topped Michigan. 'Taint so.
Sure, the Maize-and-Blue were clobbered 25 to 0, but remember that
Michigan State is one of the two best teams in the country, and it's no dis
grace to fall prey to the Spartans. Also remember that Michigan was a
vastly improved team against Stanford. Coaches for both sides and the
press agree on that. The Wolverines used a different type of attack and had
the services of All-American tackle Tom Johnson, who sat out the Michigan
State game.
The Wolverines have as good a line as Stanford will face anywhere
on the coast, except may he for Cal and they will beat a lot of teams this
year. Just because the Michiganders have lost two games in a row, that
doesn't mean ihat they are going to emulate the University of Chicago
and drop football. Yes, a GOOD football team was beaten liy an even
BETTER team last Saturday.
But a word of warning is necessary. â€¢
Stanford will have to improve even more to beat the Baby Blue Bruins
from West wood way. They will have to improve their downfield blocking
and their tackling. Dutch Fehring, a keen scout, has seen Coach Red Sanders'
team in all three of its games, and reports that they are even better than they
were last year and the year before. And for the record, UCLA has pre
vailed over the kids from the Farm the past two seasons.
UCLA is vulnerable defensively, but they have an outstanding tailback
in sophomore Paul Cameron. The Westwooders have scored 11 touchdowns
this year, and Mr. Cameron has run for three of them and passed for five.
UCLA lost by one touchdown to Texas A & M, the best team in the
Southwest, and Fehring reports that the Bruins came close to winning.
The fellas who wear the powderpuff blue jerseys chalked up 44 digits against
a good Santa Clara team. Cal could only make 34. And so this week's battle
will be a crucial in the fullest meaning of the word. It will take an outstand
ing team to outscore the Bruins.
PAGING SENATOR McCARTHY. After the game, the appreciative
alumni in Ann Arbor hosted the football team and Bay Area press with
an enticing smorgasbord dinner at the plush Washtenaw Country Club.
After a round of speeches had been made, the evening was concluded with
the Stanford Hymn.
As the assemblage rolled into the initial notes of the Hymn, one of the
football players whispered back to me, "Hey, whatinhell are the words?"
The fact that a player (or players) don't know the words is perfectly
understandable. It's quite unfootballish for a gridder to raise his voice
in organized song at the end of the game, and thus he has no opportunity
to learn the words.
So lest Senator McCarthy or Donald E. Close hear about the players'
lyric ignorance, they needn't strike up a full-Hedged investigation. Playing
good football is all we require of Chuck Taylor's kickballers.
SEEN IN THE MIDWEST DEPT. Al Berry, sports editor emeritus of
The Daily, came all the way from New York to see his beloved Indians whip
Michigan. Berry, who filled in at water boy, is now with the advertising
department of General Electric. Ted Hariton, well-muscled Indian wrestler
for the past two years and a member of Excom last year, is now a student
at Michigan. Secretly, though, he rooted for Stanford. Rachel Oatman, who
booked it up at Stanford the past two years, is now a student at Northwestern.
She still waves a sturdy pom-pom lor the Indians, however.
