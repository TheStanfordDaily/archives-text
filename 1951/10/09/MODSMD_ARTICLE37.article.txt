# Full Mural Plan Open To Part-Time Athletes

### DON GILLIN 
Fall is th'"' time for football, and each September finds campus
fans eager y awaiting the opening kick-off and the beginning of
another exciting intercollegiate sports season.
Hundreds of these same students, however .intend to be in, as
! well as at, the various games. Such an opportunity is offered them

through the University's extensive
intramural sports program.
The intramural setup is a partici
pant program, designed to provide
; athletic opportunities for the ma
! jority of students having neither the
! time nor the supersonic skill re
j quired for participation in intercol
legiate activities.
Program Purely Amateur
The program, depending on the
efforts of part-time sportsmen, is
operated on a purely amateur basis.
Members of major sports squads are
forbidden to compete in any intra
mural sports in which they are
presently participating.
Members of Stanford's various
intercollegiate squads can gain val
uable and relaxing experience in
any sport other than that in which

:hey do compete.
Nearly every organization on the
campus enters teams in the various
intramural fields. Living units both
on the campus and in Stanford Vil
lage, graduate schools, fraternities,
and eating clubs are among those
entitled to take part. Each of these
groups selects an athletic manager,
whose duty it is to organize a team,
acquaint it with the rules of play,
and see that it meets the schedule
of the Intramural Department.
Both equipment and advice are
furnished, free of charge, by Elwyn
Bugge and assistants at the Intra
mural Office in the Men's Gym. In
tramural handbooks, setting forth all
pertinent rules and regulations, are
also available.
Many Sports Available
The list of intramural sports of
fered this quarter is both an impos
ing and a diversified one, including
football, volleyball. ping pong,

' f'
handball, horseshoes, and bowling.
Winter quarter will again feature
bowling and table tennis, together
with both boxing and wrestling.
! Basketball, which last year em
ployed 912 players, will again be the
season's chief attraction. Spring will
usher in the traditional sports: soft
ball, golf, swimming, tennis, and
I track. Handball, horseshoes, and
volleyball are also scheduled.
Trophies Awarded
The University has followed a
policy of awarding distinctive tro
! phies to the teams winning Univer
sity championships. Each year a
permanent All-University trophy is
awarded to the team accumulating
the greatest number of points dur
ing the intramural year. Points are
awarded, in varying amounts, for
everything from inter-league plac
ing to University championships.
All in all, the 1951-52 season ap
pears to be shaping up as another
great intramural year, one in which
every eager competitor should be
able to find his own particular place
in Stanford's athletic setup. To
quote Mr. Alfred R. Masters, Uni
versity Director of Athletics, "The
more the merrier!"
