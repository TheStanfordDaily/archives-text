# Sig Chi Blanks D.U.
## Ray Hile Ace In 20-0 Win 
### 
Sparked by the fine passing arm
of Ray Hile, the Sigma Chi seven
started the intramural football sea
son off with a 20-0 victory over the
DU's.
Hile and crew opened up early in
the game when Ken LaCrosse took
a short pass in the DU secondary
and cut to the sidelines, racing 40
yards to a touchdown. The conver
sion attempt failed as a pass to Joe
Miller in the end zone was wide.
Burr Nelson took to the air for
the DU's though it was to no avail,
for they were forced to punt. The
first half ended with Hile passing to
LaCrosse at midfield.
The DU's kicked off to start the
second half. Alter an exchange of
downs, Hile started Sigma Chi roll
ing with a series of short passes.
Hile passed to Tom Perko for 10.
Joe Miller for 15, Roy Gill for 15
more, and again to Miller on the
DU 11. This is where DU Earl
Salz intercepted and ran it out to
the 30-yard line. After the DU's
were forced to punt, the Hile-engi
neered crew scored on a 25-yard
pass to Tom Perko who made a fine
circus catch.
One down after the kickoff, Don
Patch was caught in the end zone
for a safety, making the score 14-0
at this point. Receiving the DU
kick, Sigma Chi moved 50 yards to
the final score. Hile passed to Perko
for 15. to Miller for 20, and then 1o
Gill on the four-yard line. The score
came with a spot pass over the cen
ter to Gill.â€”H. M.
