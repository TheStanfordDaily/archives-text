# Frosh Building Big Game Fire
## 
### 
A small wood pile in Lake Lag is
the beginning of this year's Big Game
bonfire.
Palo Alto nurseries, house wreck
ers, and tree surgeons have been
dumping their excess wood in the
lake-bed as a start toward the bon
fire.
Fifty freshmen worked last Satur
day hauling wood from this area to
the dried-out lake bed. By next week
trucks will be available and a definite
time schedule worked out, so that
freshmen can make regular pick-ups.
Herb Dwight, chairman of the bon
fire said that they still need more
trucks and a lot more wood. Any
one with either of these items to do
nate can contact Dwight at the ASSU
office, DA 3-8201.
