# Dane Gives Scries Talk On Enzymes
## 
### 
"Enzymes are proteins which j
when brought into contact with |
a substrate cause the substrate to
change," Dr. Kaj Ulrik Linder
strom-Lang, director of the Carls-•
berg Laboratory of Copenhagen, j
Denmark, told the audience at
the Tuesday Evening Series last
night.
The entertaining biochemist de- !
scribed the founding of the Carls- 1
berg Laboratory in 1847 by a brew- |
ery owner who had a great interest j
in science.
"From the start enzymes and pro- |
teins were the center of interest in |
the chemical department, ho said, j
and added, "Life is intimately con- i
nccted with these substances.
"For example, a lump of sugar
will remain just a lump of sugar
for a long time. However, if it is j
eaten it is converted into carbon
dioxide and water. It is enzymes '
that do (be trick."
It is possible to study portions of
some cells, eggs, and amoebae, Dr. j
Linderstrom - Lang stated. Large |
cells can be studied by teh dissec- 1
tion method. The heavy particles go 1
to the bottom and the light particles
to the top. If enzymes are present,
they are changing something and
can be detected.
He described amino acids as the
building stones in the protein
molecules. Proteins arc broken
down by enzymes and can also
break down each other. One pro
tein can break down another and
then build it up in its own image.
Dr. I inderstrom - Lang admitted
that it i.s an extremely difficult prob
lem to say what makes a protein
act sometimes as a catalyst and
sometimes not.
In describing the enzyme, how
ever, the Danish biochemist quoted
the following example, comparing
an enzyme to a camel.
Seventeen camels were to be di
vided into three parts—one-half of
the total camels, one-third of the
total, and one-ninth of the total.
This seemed impossible until some
one added another camel, making a
total of 18. Now half of 18 is fl,
one-third is 6, and one-ninth is 2,
but the total of 9, fi. and 2 is 17. The
enzyme is like the 18th camel.

total of 18. Now half of 18 is fl,
one-third is 6, and one-ninth is 2,
but the total of 9, fi. and 2 is 17. The
enzyme is like the 18th camel.
"Enzymes are proteins which j
when brought into contact with |
a substrate cause the substrate to
change," Dr. Kaj Ulrik Linder
strom-Lang, director of the Carls-•
berg Laboratory of Copenhagen, j
Denmark, told the audience at
the Tuesday Evening Series last
night.
The entertaining biochemist de- !
scribed the founding of the Carls- 1
berg Laboratory in 1847 by a brew- |
ery owner who had a great interest j
in science.
"From the start enzymes and pro- |
teins were the center of interest in |
the chemical department, ho said, j
and added, "Life is intimately con- i
nccted with these substances.
"For example, a lump of sugar
will remain just a lump of sugar
for a long time. However, if it is j
eaten it is converted into carbon
dioxide and water. It is enzymes '
that do (be trick."
It is possible to study portions of
some cells, eggs, and amoebae, Dr. j
Linderstrom - Lang stated. Large |
cells can be studied by teh dissec- 1
tion method. The heavy particles go 1
to the bottom and the light particles
to the top. If enzymes are present,
they are changing something and
can be detected.
He described amino acids as the
building stones in the protein
molecules. Proteins arc broken
down by enzymes and can also
break down each other. One pro
tein can break down another and
then build it up in its own image.
Dr. I inderstrom - Lang admitted
that it i.s an extremely difficult prob
lem to say what makes a protein
act sometimes as a catalyst and
sometimes not.
In describing the enzyme, how
ever, the Danish biochemist quoted
the following example, comparing
an enzyme to a camel.
Seventeen camels were to be di
vided into three parts—one-half of
the total camels, one-third of the
total, and one-ninth of the total.
This seemed impossible until some
one added another camel, making a
total of 18. Now half of 18 is fl,
one-third is 6, and one-ninth is 2,
but the total of 9, fi. and 2 is 17. The
enzyme is like the 18th camel.
