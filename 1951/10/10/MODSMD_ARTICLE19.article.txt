SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 9 (UP)—
| The time-honored nickel phone call

! unlike Cellar coffee) —will soon be
j just a pre - inflation memory for
i Californians.

; and resider.ee telephones will be
come effective Nov. 1. However,
the changeover to a 10-cent coin
box won't be complete until around
next June. Until then, the nickel
will still purchase a telephone call.
The move makes California the
fourth state in the union to aban
! don the five-cent call rate. The 10-
| cent charge has been introduced in
1 New York, Illinois, and Washingon.
