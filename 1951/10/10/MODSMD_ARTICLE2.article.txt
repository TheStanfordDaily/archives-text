# Allies, Reds Meet
## 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct. 10â€”!
Allied and Communist liaison ofTi- I
errs met for more than two hours
today fit Pan Mun Jom to discuss a
Communi. t proposal for immediate
resumption of the Korean armistice |
negotiations at that Red-occupied J
village.
There was no official announce
ment of results from the liaison i
meeting, first since similar efforts
failed two weeks ago, but there
were early indications that all went j
well.
Observers gave the truce talks a j
better chance of resuming than at j
my time since they were broken j
off 49 days ago on a Communist j
charge tliat a UN plane bombed j
and strafed the Kaesong neutral
zone. |
Today's meeting came after the
Communists accepted Ridgway's in- j
vitation to send liaison officers to j
Pan Mun Jom to work out proce- j
dure for resuming the peace talks }
immediately.
