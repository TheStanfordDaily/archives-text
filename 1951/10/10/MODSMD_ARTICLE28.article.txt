A quick glance at the calendar shows that for
th< second stiaight year Big Game will follow
Thanksgiving by only two days. Which means
that Thanksgiving holidays for many students
will be cut sharply.
Big Game Week means Big Game Rally,
Gaieties and many other special events build
ing ut> for Beat-the Bear Saturday. These events,
especially the gigantic Big Game Rally and
Bonfire, must have 100 per cent cooperation
from the student body to be a bang-up success.
Cardinals, Rally Com and other groups which
will be working hard on Big Game Week fes
tivities hope that students will spend their
Thanksgiving holidays on the farm working
toward a Big Game victory rather than heading
for home and turkey.
It won't be much of a sacrifice anyway, as
thousands who stayed here last year will testify.
Things, just things in general, have a habit of
popping during Big Game week.
And moreover, you might find time to study
a little. More than one student has "turned the
tide" in the battle for grades by using holiday
tune as study time.
Hoyv to make a charity drive work. That's the
job the ASSU Drives Committee has cut out for
itself. This group, just formed last spring, has
the job of coordinating the three drives held
i ach school year.
The committee acts as a steering group and
functions all year. One of the big jobs of the
group i.3 to choose chairmen for the three

drives, which are held once a quarter.
To insure a successful first year for the com
mittee, a plea has gone out to interested stu
dents to try out for jobs with the group, which
will do much research and planning. A story
on page one gives more details.
A bad wreck on the Row brings to mind a
campus bugaboo, speeding. Cars, bikes, pedes
trians and speed don't mix very well, and if
ever a place had cars, bikes and pedestrians,
this is it.
Our theory has always been that the Stanford
campus should be on a pedestrian-first policy.
Where so many persons are wandering across
streets at all times of the day and night, drivers
must adopt a slow down and wait philosophy
for the common good. Especially at night, when
the complete absence of effective street lighting
makes Stanford look like London in a blackout.
And while on the subject of speed, the waste
basket fire at Encina last night saw Stanford's
fire and police equipment rolling at breakneck
speeds. Drivers pulled off the road pretty well
to let the speeding vehicles by, but our com
plaint isn't against the lowly auto driver this
time.
It's against the firemen and policemen who
insist on whizzing through arterials depending
on sirens rather than brakes. Ambulance driv
ers, police cars and firemen must hurry, of
course, but there's a difference between hurry
ing safely and hurrying dangerously.
