# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
A ItOOTKKS 1)11 IMIVIA IN MICHIGAN

lining indiscreet enough to root for the Stanford
Joothall team in the heart of enemy entrenchments is
ii ky business.
Knemy entrenchments in this cast' is the loot ball
•l idium in Ann Arbur, Michigan, some U.OOO miles
iivvay lrom the home fort of Stanford. I arrived at

(he mammoth sunken bowl and
plunk.-d myself down in what
tinned out to be the heart of the
Michigan rooting section. Or the
: holding section, as Dick Mc-
Lean's German sidekick would
.ay. Pretty soon, the Stanford
loot bull team pushed its collective
nose through the tunnel, and witli
my Stanford jacket at full mast, I
lose in a burst of uncontained joy.
I was a lone voice in the wilder
ness.

"Shadup." ( lionised live inen who looked like f-xit
luill players who didn'l suit up.
"Yea." said three eocds. iahhing (heir pom-poms
down my throat.
"I'rp," I said, giving up Mn ( . IM | 0 f (| u . eomersa
lion.
"No more out of you," olVered several nr»re IVluhi
f;andors.
I was very happy to comply with the wishes ol these
people, beemuse there were 57,2<M» people in the Sta
dium, and as far as I eon I<l tell I w.is the only one ol
Stanford le.mini's. And when 1 am pitted against 57,1U!)
persons, 1 am a coward. True, there were II men
in red and white down on the field, but they were
busying themselves by knocking over gentlemen in
blue and gold.
Clamming up for the first 13 minutes was no task.
beeuu.se Chuck Taylor's charges were having unnice
things done to them. But as the second quarter gol
under way and Stanford roared ahead, I found my
fierce Stanfordian pride too much to control.

As the Cards racked up their second touchdown, all
I thought of was the way Dean ltorha and the Keddog
would leap a country mile when the Indians would
pierce the goal line, and how thousands of Indian
routers would follow suit. Once more forgetting my
company, I gave a rousing cheer.
This time, I was not a lone voice in the wilderness.
I was not a lone voice in the wilderness, because
there were other voices. Suggesting, "Roll 'em." 1 was
not all in favor of this idea, because I wanted to see
whether Kerkorian was going to kick the extra point.
And besides I deplore this custom of rolling people,
especially when I am the subject.
I never found out whether CJary made good the
conversion, because many hands passed me tin to
many more hands, which in turn passed me to more
hands. Somewhere along the line, someone forgot
to relay me, and I was dropped.
Something exciting happened. I know this because
everyone stood up and made a lot of noise. I am sorry
1 cannot report what was happening at the time with
journalistic accuracy, because the only view I had
was of feet, cigarette butts, and coca cola cups. And
it made me happy at the time to observe that the
gentlemen who have the coca cola concern must do
good business.
I then adjourned to the sanctuary of the press Ihjx.
Here, at least, unbiased journalists wouldn't care what
side a person roots for. "Yea, team," I cheered, en
tering the press box, and noticing that Bob Meyers
had scored the third touchdown.
"Sit down," shouted one reporter.
"Be gone," suggested another, dropping his type
writer on my foot.
From tin n on, I gave no cheers that were any louder
than the belch of a butterfly. Because, as I say, I am
essentially a coward when pitted against 57,199 Michi
gantlers.
I returned to the muted stadium late that evening,
and with undaunted fervor I intoned every Stanford
song I knew. Plus all the y»-lls.
At any rate, I had the last laugh.
