It's interesting to note—at least we hope the Stanford team finds it

interesting—Michigan Athletic Director Fritz Crisler's
comment to Chuck Taylor after the game last Saturday.
"You've got a great team out there, Chuck," said Crisler,
"Don't let them get over-confident."
We wonder if Mr. Crisler, who knows his football
backwards and upside down, saw something in the
Indians or perhaps foresaw something.
For the past two years Stanford team confidence,
if you w ill discount the Big Game, has reached its peak
the week prior to the UCLA game. Whether it ever
passed the fine, almost imperceptible, line into the
realm of ovcreonlidence. we can't say for sure, hut are
inclined to believe so.
Taylor has worked very hard this season, building
not only a strong team, but a team with confidence in
itself. He didn't have much to go on the first two games.
The boys just couldn't get themselves steamed up enough
to worry about the likes of Oregon and San Jose State.
Then last week came Michigan. Chuck wasn't wor
ried about too much confidence, because you just don't
get overconfident when you're playing a Big Ten team.
In fact, he went to an extreme to build confidence in

)lis men by doing what lew coaches ever do—he expressed confidence in
victory before the game himself.
This coming weekend, however, is something else again. Our confidence
jinx. UCLA, pulls into town.
Two years ago, we were riding on the crest of a wave. We'd racked
up San Jose State and Harvard by whopping scores. We lost a tough one
to Michigan, which we passed oil by saying, "Well, we iust weren't in their
class." And then came the liruins, who were tabbed the best cellar pros
pect of the coast. We walked into the Stadium that afternoon with an air
>112 boredom only to see the "cellar team" knock over our "Kose Howl
Hound Indians," 14 to 7.
Last year was even worse, although the Bruins weren't figured to be
as easy. But we were undefeated in three starts, just having finished smash
ing USF, 55 to 7. So what happened? UCLA, figured for a breather by many,
breathed all over us to the tune of 21 to 7.
In other words, for the past two years we have started off with a bang,
only to get banged when we ran into UCLA.
Now don't get exciti-d! What we've seen thus far this week indicates
that the boys are taking this game seriously, and so is Chuck and his
coaching staff. Dutch Fehring's scout reports show that the Bruins have
i! and know how to use it.
This is just a reminder that this weekend is another test—a test of
confidence. Whether we have too little, too much, or just enough remains
to be seen.

get overconfident when you're playing a Big Ten team.
In fact, he went to an extreme to build confidence in

)lis men by doing what lew coaches ever do—he expressed confidence in
victory before the game himself.
This coming weekend, however, is something else again. Our confidence
jinx. UCLA, pulls into town.
Two years ago, we were riding on the crest of a wave. We'd racked
up San Jose State and Harvard by whopping scores. We lost a tough one
to Michigan, which we passed oil by saying, "Well, we iust weren't in their
class." And then came the liruins, who were tabbed the best cellar pros
pect of the coast. We walked into the Stadium that afternoon with an air
>112 boredom only to see the "cellar team" knock over our "Kose Howl
Hound Indians," 14 to 7.
Last year was even worse, although the Bruins weren't figured to be
as easy. But we were undefeated in three starts, just having finished smash
ing USF, 55 to 7. So what happened? UCLA, figured for a breather by many,
breathed all over us to the tune of 21 to 7.
In other words, for the past two years we have started off with a bang,
only to get banged when we ran into UCLA.
Now don't get exciti-d! What we've seen thus far this week indicates
that the boys are taking this game seriously, and so is Chuck and his
coaching staff. Dutch Fehring's scout reports show that the Bruins have
i! and know how to use it.
This is just a reminder that this weekend is another test—a test of
confidence. Whether we have too little, too much, or just enough remains
to be seen.

It's interesting to note—at least we hope the Stanford team finds it

interesting—Michigan Athletic Director Fritz Crisler's
comment to Chuck Taylor after the game last Saturday.
"You've got a great team out there, Chuck," said Crisler,
"Don't let them get over-confident."
We wonder if Mr. Crisler, who knows his football
backwards and upside down, saw something in the
Indians or perhaps foresaw something.
For the past two years Stanford team confidence,
if you w ill discount the Big Game, has reached its peak
the week prior to the UCLA game. Whether it ever
passed the fine, almost imperceptible, line into the
realm of ovcreonlidence. we can't say for sure, hut are
inclined to believe so.
Taylor has worked very hard this season, building
not only a strong team, but a team with confidence in
itself. He didn't have much to go on the first two games.
The boys just couldn't get themselves steamed up enough
to worry about the likes of Oregon and San Jose State.
Then last week came Michigan. Chuck wasn't wor
ried about too much confidence, because you just don't
get overconfident when you're playing a Big Ten team.
