# Bob Meyers, Skip Crist Are Injured
## 
### 
Stanford's football fortunes may j
have been struck a serious blow
! yesterday.
Bob Meyers, hard - hitting full
j back, suffered what may be a shoul
der pointer or a dislocated shoul
der, and Skip Crist, second-string
fullback, pulled up with a bad knee.
Tiiis means that if either Crist
or Meyers can't go, Bob Mathias
will start his first collegiate game
at fullback. The decathlon champ
broke away for a 50-yard touch
down run in yesterday's scrimmage.
To compensate for Meyers' and
Crist's injuries, Mathias is now in
good shape.
Team doctor Stan Lordeaux said.
I "We're hoping that Meyers has
only a minor shoulder pointer, in
! which case he will be all right on
Saturday. He may have a separa
tion or a fracture, which would
mean a few weeks. If Crist's knee
isn't swollen tomorrow, he'll be all I
right. If it does swell, he has a
pulled ligament, which will shelve
him for a week or two."
Bobby Bryan banged his knee,
but he was pronounced all right. [
Harry Hugasian still has a banged- ,
up hand, but he also will be okay !
by game time. Gary Kerkorian 1
threw a Scare into the coaching staff j
when he came out of a pile with an i
ailing hand. It turned out to be
just a crazy hone.
