## 
### 
Much potential power was shown
by a classy Zete I aggregation yes
terday as they sputtered to a 14-0
win over a fighting Chi Psi I team
in the feature tilt of yesterday's
mural play. Always a string club,
the Zetes gave real promise of mak
ing a big noise in this year's campus
football chase.
Big offensive guns for the vic
tors were King McKee, Bill Mc-
Mahon, and Tom Howell, while
for the Chi PsTs Cush Bissell,
Tom Hughes, and Jack Golenor
laborcd valiantly for a losing
cause.
All scoring was done in the first
half save for a two-point safety tal
lied late in the second. The Zetes
took the opening kickoff back to
midfield. and advanced to the op
position six mainly on a run by Mc-
Kee and a McKee-McMahon pass.
Here they stalled for three downs,
but on the fourth McKee rifled a
pass to the sidelines over the goal
which Howell pulled down in a
style reminiscent of fraternity
brother Bill McColl. The attempted
conversion pass was caught out of
the end zone and ruled no good.
The Zetes tallied again on a long
Mckee-McMahon pass and a five
yarder to Don Lucas for (he score.


MURAL ACTION—Mitch Barnes, Chi Psi, leaps high to inter
cept a pass thrown by the Zete's Mckee. Unfortunately the play
was called back and the powerful Zetes scored on the next play.
The murals swung into high action this week. The Firehouse
