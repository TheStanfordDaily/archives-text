### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 9 (UP)—The
Yankees turned the Giants' dream
world into a horrible nightmare to
day with a 13 to 1 massacre that
put them in a commanding three
games to two lead in the World
Series before 47,530 fans at the Polo
Grounds. It was the next-to-worst
rout in Series history.
Rookie Gil MeDougald. the kid

from 'Frisco, hit the third grand
slam home run in Series annals lo
get the carnage under wav in a
five-run third inning, and he did
it to avenge an insult.
His blast came after Joe DiMag
gio drove in the first run with a
single to tie the score at 1-1 and
wipe out the' brief lead which the
Giants had acquired in the first in
ning.
MeDougald. who is used to btin »
insulted since the Yankees them -
selves thought so little of his tal
ents they didn't even put him on
their official printed roster this
spring, got his blast because Giant
pitcher Larry Jansen didn't want to
pitch to Johnny Mize.
So he walked Mize deliberately
t:» load the bases. That brought
up MeDougald. On the second
pitch he swung with all the mus
cles in his .skinny frame. .The ball
landed well upstairs and four
Yankees jubilantly trotted across
the plate.
But MeDougald had to share the
batting laurels with DiMaggio, little
Phil Rizzuto, who • hit a ,two-run
homer, and a raft of others. The
Yanks looked like all-stars while
the Giants just looked all startled.
