# Scientists Attend Radio Conference
## 
### 
Three Stanford scientists are at
tending a joint meeting of the In
ternational Scientific Radio Union
and the Institute of Radio Engineers
being held at Cornell University,
Ithaca, N.Y. The scientists are Drs.
O. G. Villard Jr., L. A. Manning,
and R. A. Helliwell.
Drs. Villard and Manning will de
liver papers based on work done by
Stanford scientists under an Office
of Naval Research grant. The re
search has developed now informa
tion on conditions in the ionosphere
—area 50 to 90 miles above the
earth — through radio techniques
which make use of disturbances
caused by meteors as they flash
through the ionosphere.
