ALLIES ACCEPT TRUCE—Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway accepted
the Red-proposed town of Pan Mun Jom as the site of future
peace talks. On the east-central front, Allied forces have cap
tured all but one peak on "Heartbreak Ridge," north of Yanggu.
Just west of Heartbreak Ridge, United Nations forces are driving
up Mundung Valley (1) and are waging a furious battle for "Kim
II Sung Ridge." In the west, the U.S. First Cavalry Division has
pushed forward a mile (2), northwest of Yonchon. Fighting also
continues at a bitter pace on the other fronts.—Acme Telephoto
