# Holy Encina Failing Fast
## 
### 
Encina caved in Monday night.
Or at least certain hunks of the
ancient structure chipped off.
Shortly after 10 o'clock, in Room
544, Tom Field stepped none too
lightly on a piece of cardboard. The
cardboard caved in. A piece of the
floor cracked. Plaster dropped.
In Room 434, directly below, three
frosh snoozed peacefully. Suddenly
Phil Altick pulled the sheets over
his head as hard chunks began rain
ing on his bed. Light from the room
above beamed through the three
foot crack.
A new piece of cardboard will be
installed immediately.
