# New Scholarship Trophy Awarded to Sigma Nu
## 
### 
Last night in a simple, yet impressive, after-dinner ceremony
Jud Clary, longtime friend of Stanford fraternities, presented the
Jud Clary Perpetual Scholarship Trophy, named in his honor, to
the Sigma Nu fraternity.
The trophy, newly established by the Interfraternity Council,

is to be awarded annually to the
fraternity most improved in schol
arship. Sigma Nu became the first
recipient this year by improving
from 20th place among the frater
nities in 1949-50 to third place in
1950-51.
Clary, Delta Tau Delta and
Stanford 'IKS, lias been actively
and helpfully associated with
Stanford fraternities for many
years. He served on the Interfva
ternity Board of Control for up
ward of 15 years and, according
to Director of Information Fred
Glover, "has probably been the
greatest force responsible for the
present-day sound fraternity fi
nances at Stanford."
When the IFC, acting upon a sug
gestion of Interfraternity Board of
Control, decided to establish a tro
phy last spring to promote scholar
ship among the Stanford fraterni
ties, they named it in honor and
appreciation of Clary's long friend

ship and services.
Prior to the presentation, Dr.
Raymond Harriman, head of the
Classics Department and chairman
of the University Committee on
Scholarship, spoke briefly congratu
lating the Sigma Nu's.
He cautioned the fraternity, how
ever, against slipping from their
newly won position, adding that:
"You cannot remain static; if you
are not going forward, you will go
backward."
Following Harriman. Tony Gar
rett, IFC president, introduced
Clary, who added his personal
note of congratulation. He cited
the Sigma Nu achievement as an
example of "how a fraternity,
since self operating, develops
leadership; for without strong
leadership the fraternity could
never have made such outstand
ing improvement."
Garrett introduced a number of
other guests present, including
Judge Crothers, a charter member
of the Stanford Sigma Nu chapter
and well known to Stanford
through Crothers Hall; Lang Hil
leary, alumni adviser of the Sigma
Nu chapter; and Wayne Alley, AS
SU president.
Clary and Garrett then jointly
presented the trophy to Don Sutton,
president of the house.
