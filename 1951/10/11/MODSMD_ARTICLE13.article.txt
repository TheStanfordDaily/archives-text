# Prank Ends In Expulsion
## 
### 
What began as a big joke last
Monday night in Encina ended up
far more seriously at a meeting of
Men's Council last night.
Three freshmen who lit a fire in
their wastepaper basket learned the
gravity of their offense when they
were expelled from Stanford for
three quarters. This sentence was
suspended, but an additional pen
alty expelling them from Encina for
the remainder of the quarter will
be enforced.
"I want to emphasize the serious
ness of this offense," said Dick Ben
nett, president of Men's Council.
"This prank was so serious that it
was considered outside the jurisdic
tion of Encina Council. That's why
it was brought to us."
Bennett went on to say that
pranks which might have serious
results are violations of Stanford's
Fundamental Standard.
