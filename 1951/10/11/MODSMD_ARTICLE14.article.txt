## 
### 
"It's certainly a poor way to start
oft fire prevention week," Fire Chief
John Marston commented yesterday
after two Encina men were charged
with setting a waste basket on fire in
the aged building last Monday night.
''Such a prank can prove danger
ous," the Chief warned as he cited
the Kenyon College dormitory blaze
of last year, when nine students at
the Ohio institution lost their lives
because of such practice.
The students at Kenyon had be
come so accustomed to false fire
alarms and blazing wastebaskets set
in the hallways that they paid no
heed to the fire bells when the dormi
tory actually was ablaze, Marston
pointed out.
"Stanford could have been the scene
of such a disaster if the waste basket
flames had spread," the Chief stated.
The Monday night Encina blaze
was extinguished by Stanford fire
fighters who were called to the scene.
Four trucks from the local depart
ment responded to the alarm.
"Fire prevention is only as good as
the people want it, and with co-op
eration from all students we should
reduce the number of campus fires
which have been increasing during
the past years," Chief Marston ob
served.
