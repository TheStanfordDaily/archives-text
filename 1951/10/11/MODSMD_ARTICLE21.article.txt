Vandals set the Big Game bon
fire pile in the bod of Lake Lagunita
ablaze for the second time last night
about 9:45. Flames leaped six to
eight feet into the air from several
stacks of wood, and smoke was
smelled for some distance.

impromptu bonfire, however, before
it spread to neighboring piles of
wood.
