# Indian, Bruin Bands to Play For Weekend
## 
### 
Two of the Pacific Coast's finest
marching bands will be here over the
weekend to participate in the Friday
night float parade and Saturday's
UCLA-Stanford ball game.
UCLA's Bruin Band, a lively step
ping outfit specializing in Hollywood
type music and plenty of brass, ar
rives on campus tomorrow. The band,
which includes both men and women,
will be housed on campus Friday
night.
Stanford's 88-piece band will of
course be on hand for all the events
of the weekend.
Stanford's band travelled to Los
Angeles a day before the ball game
last year in order to take part in a
homecoming festival and parade
through Westwood, and the early ap
pearance of the Bruin Band this fall
is a return gesture from UCLA.
Stanford will put on a half-time
show with a transportation theme
Saturday.
To the tune of "Come Josephine in
My Flying Machine" the band will
form an airplane. The next stunt will
be an outline of a ship, to the tune
of "Sailing, Sailing."
To the strains of "Bicycle Built for
Two" the band will form a bicycle
with moving wheels, and will move
from this to a railroad engine which
will chug down the field 10 yards.
The final stunt will be a car racing off
to the sidelines to the tune of "In My
Merry Oldsmobile."
Halftime stunts are planned by a
board headed by Jerry Krieg, band
manager and director Julius Shuchat.
Chuck Moller, a veteran clarinetist
in the band, has stepped up to the
position of drum major this year.
Krieg has asked all band members
to report in uniform at the bandhouse
at 7 p.m. for the Friday night parade.
Saturday's rehearsal will start at 9
a.m., with attendance compulsory.
