# Old System May Go For Illness Excuses
## Recommendation for Change Approved at Excom Meeting 
### 
A recommendation, which if approved by the executive com
mittee of the Academic Council would mean the end of the present
system of student health excuses, was passed by an 11 to 1 vote
of Excom last night. Dave Curry, graduate representative, was
the only dissenter.
The recommendation, proposed by Pete Holle, student health

committee head, would make a
student's word of illness acceptable
and do away with Health Service
certificates. The proposal would put
| the system on an experimental basis
! ior one academic year.
Hollo's committee urged approval
of the recommendation for the fol
! lowing reasons:
1. 'The present system implies a
| lack of confidence in the student
2..' An undue burden is placed on
the doctor? and staff at the Health
! Service and much time is spent on
, non-productive work . .
3. "Health Service physicians arc
placed in the role of judge, when
students appear for a certificate,
| having received no medical treat-
I ment. This is a role which physi
j cians should not 1m? expected to
play . . ."
4. "Statement of illness certifi
cates are obtained only at the ex
penditure of time and effort on the
part of the student . .
! The recommendation provides for
j Men's and Women's Councils to try
I violations.
If the proposal is acceptable to
the Academic Council's executive
i committee, a faculty /group, vio
lations would probably be includ
ed as Honor Code violations in
courses where class attendance is
a basis for grading. Otherwise,
violations would presumably fall
under the Fundamental Standard.
Violations on examination days
(basis for grading in all classes) also
would probably be Honor Code vio
lations.
Student Manager George Denny
reported, recommending approval of
j two appropriations from the con
tingency fund. The sum of $155 was
voted to the Debate Society to be
used in getting a debate with an
• Australian student group which will
i tour the U.S. One hundred dollars
j is to go for an honorarium for the
! group if arrangement can be made
! for their appearance here.
i Five dollars was appropriated to
the Con Homo Entertainment Com-
I mittee.

j Election Board chairman.
