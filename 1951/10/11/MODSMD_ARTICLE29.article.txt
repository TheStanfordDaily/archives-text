### DICK McLEAN 
HOW TO WRITE FOR MONEY

About one frustrated writer in a thousand can sell
a short story to a magazine. About one in a million
can make a living at the hard and lonely business.
But anyone — you now reading this — can write for
money. The only prerequisites are relatives.
In short, this column will be an essay on Touche
D'Arte or the art of the good old "touch,"

Here are some examples of how
the subtle art is applied:
Dear Mother,
Please don't be alarmed that
this letter is written in someone
else's handwriting. The Reverend
was by this afternoon and he vol
unteered to write as I dictated.
Now you musn't worry as the
doctor says my chances are good.
It is only a slight case of pneu
monia.

Possibly the reason for my tardy recovery is be
cause of the penicillin. Now as you know, under the
Stanford Health Plan the school pays for all hospital
costs except those of drugs. You and Dad have been
so swell about giving me money that when the doctor
said. "This boy must have penicillin." I said, "No.
doctor. I've cost my dear parents enough. This has
got to be my own show."
The cost of the million units of the drug will come
t.o about ten dollars. And I just couldn't bring myself
to squander all that money for something so trivial.
Thanks, mom and dad, for everything.
Goodby,
Your loving son,
Waldo
P.S. If you want to mail me a letter or anything, send
it to my university residence us the hospital letter
delivery is often slow.
Knowing your audience is also a principle of writing.
Here is an example of effective technique:
Dear Grandmother,
Thank you for the Bible. It was just what I wanted
for my birthday. I do so enjoy your letters. I read
them aloud to my roommate. He doesn't have a grand
mother and I try to make him feel good.
In answer to your queston, no. I don't take out
girls, smoke, or drink. I feel that college is not the
time for such triflings and I am too young to ruin my
health.

Your suggestion about going to church every
morning sounded excellent. I have only one difli
culty—my finances (! manage my own) —won't per
mit it. The cost of books, pencils, and paper hardly
allow for the ten dollars a month for bus fare.
If it weren't for the holes in my shoes, I would walk.
Please write soon.
Your loving grandson,
Waldo
Even with an adament father, the subtle can be
applied as easily as the spear that caught Achilles.
Here's a sure fire, double saw-buck getter:
Dear Dad,
I sure am sorry about cracking up the family car
the last night before I left for college. You were per
fectly right in being angry with me. I deserved it.
But I honestly didn't know that you'd closed the
garage door when I left.
Dad, the accident has sobered me. I feel that
I'm much wiser and older since it happened. In
fact, I'm now taking Business Law 1. It is an in
teresting and valuable course. I am also considering
law as a profession instead of being a basketball
coach.
My only difficulty is buying the law books. They
cost ten dollars. Up to this time I've been getting
up two hours early to read my roommate's book. How
ever, my health won't stand it.
I've got to get back to his books, Dad.
Your loving son,
Waldo
P.S. I am carrying so manv units that I will have
to audit Business Law and it won't appear on my
transcript.
But the best touch of aIF, when the chips are gone
and the necessity huge, is your brother. (If he's work
ing).
Dear Bobby,
For God's sake airmail-special-delivery me a quick
ten. I wrote a check last night down at L'Omlettes
and just discovered my account is flat. Pappy will
disown me if I bounce another one.
Your loving brother,
Waldo

girls, smoke, or drink. I feel that college is not the
time for such triflings and I am too young to ruin my
health.

Your suggestion about going to church every
morning sounded excellent. I have only one difli
culty—my finances (! manage my own) —won't per

Even with an adament father, the subtle can be
applied as easily as the spear that caught Achilles.
Here's a sure fire, double saw-buck getter:
Dear Dad,
I sure am sorry about cracking up the family car
the last night before I left for college. You were per
fectly right in being angry with me. I deserved it.
But I honestly didn't know that you'd closed the
garage door when I left.
Dad, the accident has sobered me. I feel that
I'm much wiser and older since it happened. In
fact, I'm now taking Business Law 1. It is an in
teresting and valuable course. I am also considering
law as a profession instead of being a basketball
coach.
My only difficulty is buying the law books. They
cost ten dollars. Up to this time I've been getting
up two hours early to read my roommate's book. How
ever, my health won't stand it.
I've got to get back to his books, Dad.
Your loving son,
Waldo
P.S. I am carrying so manv units that I will have
to audit Business Law and it won't appear on my
transcript.
But the best touch of aIF, when the chips are gone
and the necessity huge, is your brother. (If he's work
ing).
Dear Bobby,
For God's sake airmail-special-delivery me a quick
ten. I wrote a check last night down at L'Omlettes
and just discovered my account is flat. Pappy will
disown me if I bounce another one.

HOW TO WRITE FOR MONEY

About one frustrated writer in a thousand can sell
a short story to a magazine. About one in a million
can make a living at the hard and lonely business.
But anyone — you now reading this — can write for
money. The only prerequisites are relatives.
In short, this column will be an essay on Touche
D'Arte or the art of the good old "touch,"

Here are some examples of how
the subtle art is applied:
Dear Mother,
Please don't be alarmed that
this letter is written in someone
else's handwriting. The Reverend
was by this afternoon and he vol
unteered to write as I dictated.
Now you musn't worry as the
doctor says my chances are good.
It is only a slight case of pneu
monia.

Possibly the reason for my tardy recovery is be
cause of the penicillin. Now as you know, under the
Stanford Health Plan the school pays for all hospital
costs except those of drugs. You and Dad have been
so swell about giving me money that when the doctor
said. "This boy must have penicillin." I said, "No.
doctor. I've cost my dear parents enough. This has
got to be my own show."
The cost of the million units of the drug will come
t.o about ten dollars. And I just couldn't bring myself
to squander all that money for something so trivial.
Thanks, mom and dad, for everything.
Goodby,
Your loving son,
Waldo
P.S. If you want to mail me a letter or anything, send
it to my university residence us the hospital letter
delivery is often slow.
Knowing your audience is also a principle of writing.
Here is an example of effective technique:
Dear Grandmother,
Thank you for the Bible. It was just what I wanted
for my birthday. I do so enjoy your letters. I read
them aloud to my roommate. He doesn't have a grand
mother and I try to make him feel good.
In answer to your queston, no. I don't take out
girls, smoke, or drink. I feel that college is not the
time for such triflings and I am too young to ruin my
