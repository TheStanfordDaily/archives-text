Dave Exley, former journalism graduate student
at Stanford, from New Zealand has written the follow
ing letter describing his activities as an intern at
the I nited Nations. His letter will he published in
The Daily in two installments.
United Nations Headquarters
October 8, 1951
Stanford has made its mark on the United Nations;
:tny student who comes here from the Farm in future
has a reputation to live up to.
And that reputation is—noisy!
So says one of the directors of the United Nations
Student Intern Program, Philippe du Nouy. a French
man.
Monsieur du Nouy should know, because during the
past two summers, he has helped to organize an eight
week program at the United Nations for students from
all over the world. In both programs, Stanford has
been liberally represented.
This past summer there were three of us from
I.SJI — Tom Rwtlctt (Class of '51). Stanford's
Rhodes Scholar for this year, and now at Oxford;
ASSU exchange scholar, Karl Kisler. from Austria:
and myself.
We were three of 36 students temporarily attached
to the staff of the United Nations to get an idea of
the setup, and to become aware of the driving spirit
behind the organization.
And, it was hoped, that by working together ;md
meeting socially as a group, we would feel ;i little more
tolerant towards other peoples, and build up good will
for each other.
The .{6 were from 28 different countries, so we were
like a little United Nations ourselves. Even such re
mote countries as Iceland. Syria and Iran were rep
resented. Except for the United States and France,
each country sent only one student.
Stanford, of course, with three representatives, did
better than most universities. With the exception of
Columbia. Stanford sent more students than any
other colleirc to this year's program.
Many of the 36 came to the UN after studying ;it
universities in different parts of the United States.
Naturally, at such a gathering, it wasn't long before
we began to compare and contrast the universities
which had ndopted us, but the vocally-predominant

Stanford group raised their voice above the clamour
on every possible pretext. So that by the end of the
eight weeks, 35 of the 36 UN students were pretty well
versed on the advantages of a Stanford education. The
3fith didn't speak English, so. obviously, he'll never
know what he missed. (Point well taken).
For instance, it was really interesting to hear Tom
Bartlett lead a busload of noisy United Nations stu
dents in a couple of Stanford songs when returning
from a long weekend—and all thoroughly enjoying it.
Then, Karl Kisler was always eager to sound off on
the privileges of living in California, and Stanford in
particular, at any given or not given time.
And, admittedly, I was always willing to say a few
words on the subject, too. in between "selling" New
Zealand to those searching for God's own country.
Moreover, the UN Secretariat hasn't forgotten the
Western impact last year of Don Toussaint and other
Stanford delegates to former intern programs.
The morning we first arrived outside that huge
glass structure down on New York's First Avenue
was unforgettable.
Whether you like the appearance of the building or
not, it can't fail to impress you, standing immediately
outside the main entrance, gazing up at a wall of
polished glass with gleaming aluminum sashes —38
stories high.
My UN supervisor—a Mexican—has dubbed it"The
Glass Menagerie," because of its looks and staff.
Inside, the building is perhaps even more impres
sive. Office equipment and appliances meet the latest
standards in design and efliciency, and everything
looks clean and new. The freshly-painted cream
walls give a light, airy appearance, aided by the
landscape windows which overlook the East Kiver
on one side and towards the skyscrapers of Man
hattan on the other.
Over the way. the skeleton of the new General As
sembly building is taking shape, and the building
should be ready for next year's session of the As
sembly in September.
The conference area is almost finished and will be
opened shortly. Here, the three councils (Security
Trusteesliip, and Economic and Social) will meet in
their own chambers, specially decorated by the Gov
ernments of Norway. Denmark and Sweden.


STUDY IN INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING—Two ex-Stanford foreign stuaents are in this
group, representing six countries, who discovered that there's a lot to this idea of international
good will. The Stanford men are Karl Kisler ('5l ASSU scholar from Austria) in Californian shirt,
and David Exley (New Zealand) in foreground. Students pictured were internes at the United
Nations this summer.

United Nations Headquarters
October 8, 1951
Stanford has made its mark on the United Nations;
:tny student who comes here from the Farm in future
has a reputation to live up to.
And that reputation is—noisy!
So says one of the directors of the United Nations
Student Intern Program, Philippe du Nouy. a French
man.
Monsieur du Nouy should know, because during the
past two summers, he has helped to organize an eight
week program at the United Nations for students from
all over the world. In both programs, Stanford has
been liberally represented.
This past summer there were three of us from
I.SJI — Tom Rwtlctt (Class of '51). Stanford's
Rhodes Scholar for this year, and now at Oxford;
ASSU exchange scholar, Karl Kisler. from Austria:
and myself.
We were three of 36 students temporarily attached
to the staff of the United Nations to get an idea of
the setup, and to become aware of the driving spirit
behind the organization.
And, it was hoped, that by working together ;md
meeting socially as a group, we would feel ;i little more
tolerant towards other peoples, and build up good will
for each other.
The .{6 were from 28 different countries, so we were
like a little United Nations ourselves. Even such re
mote countries as Iceland. Syria and Iran were rep
resented. Except for the United States and France,
each country sent only one student.
Stanford, of course, with three representatives, did
better than most universities. With the exception of
Columbia. Stanford sent more students than any
other colleirc to this year's program.
Many of the 36 came to the UN after studying ;it
universities in different parts of the United States.
Naturally, at such a gathering, it wasn't long before
we began to compare and contrast the universities
which had ndopted us, but the vocally-predominant

Stanford group raised their voice above the clamour
on every possible pretext. So that by the end of the
eight weeks, 35 of the 36 UN students were pretty well
versed on the advantages of a Stanford education. The
3fith didn't speak English, so. obviously, he'll never
know what he missed. (Point well taken).
For instance, it was really interesting to hear Tom
Bartlett lead a busload of noisy United Nations stu
dents in a couple of Stanford songs when returning
from a long weekend—and all thoroughly enjoying it.
Then, Karl Kisler was always eager to sound off on
the privileges of living in California, and Stanford in
particular, at any given or not given time.
And, admittedly, I was always willing to say a few
words on the subject, too. in between "selling" New
Zealand to those searching for God's own country.
Moreover, the UN Secretariat hasn't forgotten the
Western impact last year of Don Toussaint and other
Stanford delegates to former intern programs.
The morning we first arrived outside that huge
glass structure down on New York's First Avenue
was unforgettable.
Whether you like the appearance of the building or
not, it can't fail to impress you, standing immediately
outside the main entrance, gazing up at a wall of
polished glass with gleaming aluminum sashes —38
stories high.
My UN supervisor—a Mexican—has dubbed it"The
Glass Menagerie," because of its looks and staff.
Inside, the building is perhaps even more impres
sive. Office equipment and appliances meet the latest
standards in design and efliciency, and everything
looks clean and new. The freshly-painted cream
walls give a light, airy appearance, aided by the
landscape windows which overlook the East Kiver
on one side and towards the skyscrapers of Man
hattan on the other.
Over the way. the skeleton of the new General As
sembly building is taking shape, and the building
should be ready for next year's session of the As
sembly in September.
The conference area is almost finished and will be
opened shortly. Here, the three councils (Security
Trusteesliip, and Economic and Social) will meet in
their own chambers, specially decorated by the Gov
ernments of Norway. Denmark and Sweden.

Dave Exley, former journalism graduate student

The Daily in two installments.
United Nations Headquarters
October 8, 1951
Stanford has made its mark on the United Nations;
:tny student who comes here from the Farm in future
has a reputation to live up to.
And that reputation is—noisy!
So says one of the directors of the United Nations
Student Intern Program, Philippe du Nouy. a French
man.
Monsieur du Nouy should know, because during the
past two summers, he has helped to organize an eight
week program at the United Nations for students from
all over the world. In both programs, Stanford has
been liberally represented.
This past summer there were three of us from
I.SJI — Tom Rwtlctt (Class of '51). Stanford's
Rhodes Scholar for this year, and now at Oxford;
ASSU exchange scholar, Karl Kisler. from Austria:
and myself.
We were three of 36 students temporarily attached
to the staff of the United Nations to get an idea of
the setup, and to become aware of the driving spirit
behind the organization.
And, it was hoped, that by working together ;md
meeting socially as a group, we would feel ;i little more
tolerant towards other peoples, and build up good will
for each other.
The .{6 were from 28 different countries, so we were
like a little United Nations ourselves. Even such re
mote countries as Iceland. Syria and Iran were rep
resented. Except for the United States and France,
each country sent only one student.
Stanford, of course, with three representatives, did
better than most universities. With the exception of
Columbia. Stanford sent more students than any
other colleirc to this year's program.
Many of the 36 came to the UN after studying ;it
universities in different parts of the United States.
Naturally, at such a gathering, it wasn't long before
we began to compare and contrast the universities
which had ndopted us, but the vocally-predominant

Stanford group raised their voice above the clamour
on every possible pretext. So that by the end of the
eight weeks, 35 of the 36 UN students were pretty well
versed on the advantages of a Stanford education. The
3fith didn't speak English, so. obviously, he'll never
know what he missed. (Point well taken).
For instance, it was really interesting to hear Tom
Bartlett lead a busload of noisy United Nations stu
dents in a couple of Stanford songs when returning
from a long weekend—and all thoroughly enjoying it.
Then, Karl Kisler was always eager to sound off on
the privileges of living in California, and Stanford in
particular, at any given or not given time.
And, admittedly, I was always willing to say a few
words on the subject, too. in between "selling" New
Zealand to those searching for God's own country.
Moreover, the UN Secretariat hasn't forgotten the
Western impact last year of Don Toussaint and other
Stanford delegates to former intern programs.
The morning we first arrived outside that huge
glass structure down on New York's First Avenue
was unforgettable.
Whether you like the appearance of the building or
not, it can't fail to impress you, standing immediately
outside the main entrance, gazing up at a wall of
polished glass with gleaming aluminum sashes —38
stories high.
My UN supervisor—a Mexican—has dubbed it"The
Glass Menagerie," because of its looks and staff.
Inside, the building is perhaps even more impres
sive. Office equipment and appliances meet the latest
standards in design and efliciency, and everything
looks clean and new. The freshly-painted cream
walls give a light, airy appearance, aided by the
landscape windows which overlook the East Kiver
on one side and towards the skyscrapers of Man
hattan on the other.
Over the way. the skeleton of the new General As
sembly building is taking shape, and the building
should be ready for next year's session of the As
sembly in September.
The conference area is almost finished and will be
opened shortly. Here, the three councils (Security
Trusteesliip, and Economic and Social) will meet in
their own chambers, specially decorated by the Gov
ernments of Norway. Denmark and Sweden.
