# AT UC CAMPUSES
## 
### 
The chem students at *UCLA
should have experienced a growth
in vocabulary after a recent lecture.
Topic for a seminar announced in
the Daily Bruin was "Interconver
sion of Cyclobutyl and Cyclopro
pylcarbinyl and Allylcarbinyl De
rivatives."
A small panic recently occurred
on the Cal campus, brought on by
a unique coincidence. It just hap
pened that Berkeley decided to test
air raid sirens on the same day that
the Daily Cal tucked what-to-do
in-'case instructions in the paper.
From Ihe number of students who
grabbed for their preparedness in
serts. the Berkeley city defense
council should have gotten an indi
cation of how effective the practice
was.
