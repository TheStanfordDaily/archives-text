# 'Sex After 6' War Raging
## 
### 
The "sex after six" controversy
that waged at Princeton last year
| has spread to Harvard.
The current fuss at the staid col
lege is over the ruling that women
, are not allowed in men's rooms on
Friday and Saturday nights.
| Students are now petitioning for
Friday and Saturday room privi
leges, which would permit women
in rooms until 11 p.m.
In a letter to the house masters,
Harvard men explained the reason
for their request.
"After 8 p.m. a man who wishes
to study or merely be with a girl
can do so only in Widener (the li
brary) or Cronin's or in some more
expensive place if he requires pri
vacy. Many who cannot afford
these luxuries remain frustrated.
"The extra three hours which we
request on, two nights in the week
would allow a man to entertain a
girl respectably without taking her
into Boston, and would not jeopar
dize the good name of Harvard any
more than does the present ruling."
i The request for later hours was
made last year, but was rejected.
The present campaign is the sixth
one since the war.
