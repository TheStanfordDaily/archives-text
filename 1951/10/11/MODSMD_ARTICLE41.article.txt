# Fields Will Star In Sunday Movie
## 
### 
"You Can't Cheat an Honest
Man," starring VV. C. Fields and
Bei>en and McCarthy, will be this
week's Sunday Night Movie.
The plot has Fields as a showman
attempting to keep his carnival out
ol the hands of the sheriff. This
plot, of course, merely serves as an
excuse to set up many hilarious sit
uations including a mock ping pong
game, a run-away balloon sequence,
and numerous frantic chases.
In addition to the show, a cartoon
and the next installment of "The
James Brothers ol Missouri" will be
shown. Admission will be the usual
20 cents.
