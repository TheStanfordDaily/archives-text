# PRO AND CAHN

### 
Almost a week has passed since the California-Minnesota fiasco, but yet
we can't erase from our memory the picture of that charging Bear line,
their driving, fast backs, Olszewski; Powell, West and Robinson, and most
vivid of all, fifty-five big points against a Big Ten representative.
And that Les Richter is a true all-American. He appears to be at
tracted to anyone carrying a football.
Nevertheless, I am not convinced that the Big Bad Bears are the Nation's
number one team, and even if they are I am not dreading the thought of
the Big Game which seems almost too terrifying for some to think about.
Minnesota was operating with an eighteen-year-old sophomore quarter
back, Paul Giel and still completed 14 out of 26 passes. California does not
have an adequate pass defense for such a highly touted team. It is true that
the Gopher backs could find no holes in the Cal forward wall, but the
Minnesota line was young, green, big, but no good. What's more, Billy Mais,
Bear signal caller, is not an excellent passer and his ends are far from the best.
There is no taking away that our Berkeley neighbors are good, hut the
right team with a good passer, good ends, good backs, and an agressive line
can beat California. Hold on real tightly to those Big Game ducats. Some
one might get surprised come Nov. 24.
We sure feel for those poor California rooters. What a life they lead.
Such monotony in watching a team of Waldorf-wound mechanical men.
On > win after another. The boredom of it all. They miss the thrill of being
underdogs and winning. They miss the disappointment of being favored and
over losing. It's always a case of being favored and winning. Nothing to
shout about. Nothing to jump for joy over. Why if it wasn't for Rose Bowl
losses, California football would be as monotonous and dull as an 8 o'clock
six times a week.
But here on the Farm we more fortunate never know until the sun
sinks below the Stadium rim whether that night will bring sorrow drowned
by drink or drink adding to the joy of it all. It may be rationalizing, hut
we like the uniertainity of having most games toss up*, for example the
UCLA tusscl. Our hearts say a win, our heads are doubtful, and our
pocket book says don't bet.
ON 'HIE NOSE
Seems that Chuck Taylor hit the nail on the head when he requested
tough games be scheduled because breathers are just no good. In easy
contests the team doesn't get high, and subsequently flounders to a worth
less win. Taylor wants intersectionals where if the Indians win, it means
something and if not, they lose to a good club. The pattern is certainly taking
form this year. After sloppy Oregon and San Jose State showings, the Cards
showed well against Michigan, just like Chuek said they would.
lIOW THINGS CHANGE
It was only a dozen days ago that Danny Hill, publicity Director of San
Jose had a saucy comment following the Spartan-Indian farce. When ap
proached as to how he felt about Stanford going to the Rose Bowl, Hill
replied, "Stanford will be there all right, if they get tickets."
Aud now in hist five days a dark, ominous grid future has suddenly
blossomed into the start of a season which has Stanford followers hoping',
hoping, and hoping.

vivid of all, fifty-five big points against a Big Ten representative.
And that Les Richter is a true all-American. He appears to be at
tracted to anyone carrying a football.
Nevertheless, I am not convinced that the Big Bad Bears are the Nation's
number one team, and even if they are I am not dreading the thought of
the Big Game which seems almost too terrifying for some to think about.
Minnesota was operating with an eighteen-year-old sophomore quarter
back, Paul Giel and still completed 14 out of 26 passes. California does not
have an adequate pass defense for such a highly touted team. It is true that
the Gopher backs could find no holes in the Cal forward wall, but the
Minnesota line was young, green, big, but no good. What's more, Billy Mais,
Bear signal caller, is not an excellent passer and his ends are far from the best.
There is no taking away that our Berkeley neighbors are good, hut the
right team with a good passer, good ends, good backs, and an agressive line
can beat California. Hold on real tightly to those Big Game ducats. Some
one might get surprised come Nov. 24.
We sure feel for those poor California rooters. What a life they lead.
Such monotony in watching a team of Waldorf-wound mechanical men.
On > win after another. The boredom of it all. They miss the thrill of being
underdogs and winning. They miss the disappointment of being favored and
over losing. It's always a case of being favored and winning. Nothing to
shout about. Nothing to jump for joy over. Why if it wasn't for Rose Bowl
losses, California football would be as monotonous and dull as an 8 o'clock
six times a week.
But here on the Farm we more fortunate never know until the sun
sinks below the Stadium rim whether that night will bring sorrow drowned
by drink or drink adding to the joy of it all. It may be rationalizing, hut
we like the uniertainity of having most games toss up*, for example the
UCLA tusscl. Our hearts say a win, our heads are doubtful, and our
pocket book says don't bet.
ON 'HIE NOSE
Seems that Chuck Taylor hit the nail on the head when he requested
tough games be scheduled because breathers are just no good. In easy
contests the team doesn't get high, and subsequently flounders to a worth
less win. Taylor wants intersectionals where if the Indians win, it means
something and if not, they lose to a good club. The pattern is certainly taking
form this year. After sloppy Oregon and San Jose State showings, the Cards
showed well against Michigan, just like Chuek said they would.
lIOW THINGS CHANGE
It was only a dozen days ago that Danny Hill, publicity Director of San
Jose had a saucy comment following the Spartan-Indian farce. When ap
proached as to how he felt about Stanford going to the Rose Bowl, Hill
replied, "Stanford will be there all right, if they get tickets."
Aud now in hist five days a dark, ominous grid future has suddenly
blossomed into the start of a season which has Stanford followers hoping',
hoping, and hoping.
Almost a week has passed since the California-Minnesota fiasco, but yet
we can't erase from our memory the picture of that charging Bear line,
their driving, fast backs, Olszewski; Powell, West and Robinson, and most
vivid of all, fifty-five big points against a Big Ten representative.
