# Weeping While Winning—- Weekly Waldorf Routine
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
All is quiet for the night in the little town of Berkeley, California.
The Cal footballers have been locked in their cages, and the Min
nesota team is resting comfortably in their private wing of the
Berkeley Hospital (a courtesy supplied to all opponents of the
U. of C.). All is quiet, that is, except for the distant sound of a

man sobbing.
Upon further investigation, we j
find, tucked away in a corner of the
university, a white-haired, rather i
rotund gentleman in his lower fif
ties, sitting at a small table with a
box of Kleenex in one hand and a |
glass ol Acme (complete with egg) !
in the other—Lynn "Pappy" Wal
dorf ii crying in his beer. Through
bis sobs can be heard that the sixth
string offensive right guard was j
highly inadequate on one of the
blocks he threw, and that the i-ev- j
enth - string offensive end looked j
very sloppy in catching that touch- j
down pass.
Sad as it may sound, very few j
seem to sympathize with Mr. Wal- j
dorf, as his 24 K. Golden Bears j
continue to roll over tough opposi
tion like robots from another planet, J
and sports writers claim with equal ,
that this is the best of the |
Bears and the Bears are the best in |
the country. Pappy has started j
something that will be pretty hard
to stop.
In the 194<> season. Cal won but
one game and had trouble getting
10,000 fans for some of their "little
ones." Since 1*147, when Lynn
Waldorf came from Northwestern,
California has lost but one con- j
ference game and has not been
beaten in 35 straight regular-sea
son contests.
The prospect for this year—an
other undefeated team. The pros
pect for next year—to 40 top
men hack and another undefeated
team. The prospect for the year
after that—things don't look too
good. Pappy expects not more
than four or five strings of top
players. How does he do it and
where does he get them?
The answer to this is organiza
tion, competition, and DEPTH. Pap
py has about one of the best coach
ing staffs that money can buy, and
Cal has the money to buy. With
this staff, the Berkeley team is or
ganized to get the best out of each
man, from frosh Rambler to varsity !
star. Fundamentals are stressed j
again and again, until the Cal j
blockers work with sheer perfec
tion. Competition for each position
is extremely keen, keeping the men
up for every game.
Pappy's crying towel also does
much to get the Bears up, and no
body, except maybe a poor little
Indian in the Big Game, can be up
like the Bears can be up. Against
a Minnesota rated as the best Go
pher team to come out of the Mid
west since before the war, Cal
ripped off 638 yards and 55 points
without the services of six laid-up
regulars.
As far as depth goes. Cal has it.

| Their first team played for hut
little over one quarter last Sat
urday, and from then on every
j one, even the Ramblers it seemed,
had a part in the debacle. The
j victory was so convincing that
S one frustrated newsman suggest
ed that Cal leave the PCC and
turn pro.
Certainly the biue and Gold
| won't have a bad season in the near
I future, and with a school the size
( of theirs to draw talent from, prob
ably not jl'or a long, long time.
| Nothing snort of another earth
j quake or a really hot Big Red Ma
j chine will put a dent in the big bad
j Bear's fur coat. And there are
doubts about the earthquake.
