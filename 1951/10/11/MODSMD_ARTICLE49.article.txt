# Yanks Cop 14th Series
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 10 (UP)—lt's
the same old story — but with a
breathless new ending — the Yan
kees are world champions again.
For the third straight year and
for the 14th time in 18 tries since
1921, the aristocrats of baseball won
the World Series today, by beat
ing the scrapping, never - quitting
Giants, 4 to 3, before 61,711 fans on
a chill, gray, windswept afternoon
at Yankee Stadium. That made it
four games to two — and it takes
four games to win.
And as these 1951 edition heroes
whooped off the field with practiced
jauntiness, it was Hank Bauer, a
rough and ready guy from the
packing - house town of East St.
Louis, 111., who got the heartiest
plaudits because he put the game
into the book* with a grand slam
three-run triple in the sixth inning.
