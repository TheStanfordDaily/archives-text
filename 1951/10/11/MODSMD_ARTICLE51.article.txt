# Mathias or Laubscher to Start at Full
## 
### 
Bob Mathias and Wes Laubscher
were given thorough coaching in
assignments in yesterday's dummy
scrimmage, since one of the two
will probably be starting fullback
j this Saturday.
Skip Crist, victim of a banged-up
j knee, was definitely declared out,
; and first - string Bob Meyers was
I given an "outside chance" to play.
Meyers has a shoulder pointer
| which may come around in time.
UCLA also has its injury woes.
; Ted Narleski, who was beaten out
for first-string tailback by Pitchin'
Paul Cameron, has a bad foot and
won't even make the trip to Stan
ford. Linebacker Donn Moomaw,
1 All-American linebacker, may not
i be at peak efficiency ... if he plays
at all. And captain Hal Mitchell,
tackle, is in a similar position.
The Indian defenses have been
setting themselves to stop Cameron,
the soph whiz. Cameron figured in
six of the seven touchdowns that
gave Santa Clara its worst defeat in
23 years last week.
He ran for tallies of one and five
yards, and then hit receivers with
tosses of 29, 55, 11, and .'5O yards for
four more scores and a new Bruin
school record for TD tosses. The old
mark was set by Bob Waterfield in
1942.
In the meantime, Red Sanders of
UCLA put his Bruins through a
strenuous passing and pass defense
drill yesterday. Cameron, Bob
Florence, and Bob Moore were do
ing the parsing to Ernie Stockert
and Peter O'Garro.


PACES BRUIN ATTACKâ€”Currently pacing the PCC in total of
fense, Uclan soph tailback Paul Cameron has been hailed by
Coast sports scribes as the greatest thing to hit the Westwood
campus since the advent of the great Kenny Washington.
