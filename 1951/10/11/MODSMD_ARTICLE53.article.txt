# Poison Oak, Colds Crowd Rest Homes
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
Last fall a group of Roblc girls
needed some decorations for a Hal
loween party. Calling upon an En
cina friend (who owned a car), they
roamed the woods, returning hap
pily with armfuls of beautiful red
leaves.
Unfortunately, none of them at
tended the party that night. They
were all in the rest homes with poi
son oak.
Cases like this arc an everyday
occurrence to Mrs. George Murray,
director of the Women's Rest Home,
and to Mrs. Elmer Hogland, director
of the Men's Rest Home.
And poison oak is just one of the
many ailments that students may
be treated for in the two homes on
peaceful, shady Salvatierra Street
here on the Stanford campus.
Mrs. Murray reports that colds
seem to be the most common
trouble among the girls; Mrs.
Hogland says her patients have
ailments ranging from minor ath
letic injuries to the flu. Both
agree that almost all the sick
ness is a result of fatigue brought
on by school life and that what
students need (and get) at the
Rest Home is REST.
At times, Mrs. Hogland has been
invaded by good portions of the
basketball and football teams want
ing no treatment other than a good
night's sleep on Friday nights. (How
can they miss, with lights out at 10
sharp?)
Any weary student, however,
cannot gain admittance to these ha
vens of peace and quiet. (Some stu
dents have the idea that they can
knock on the door and be taken
right in.) The homes are under the
direction of the Health Service and
it is the Health Service alone that
sends students to (and releases
them from) the Rest Homes. Doc
tors from the Service call each day
at the homes and are on immediate
call at all times.

I The history of the Rest Homes
j ". . . all started verv simply in
(he In-ginning." Mrs. Murray says.
The Palo Alto Hospital then had
a much smaller capacity and Mrs.
Edwin Thomas, a Stanford grad
uate and Palo Alto resident, of
fered to take sick students into
her own home.
That was over 25 years ago. Later,
at the meetings of the Stanford
Mothers' Club, the mothers volun
teered to take ill students into their
homes. Soon Mrs. Owen was run
ning the first Stanford Rest Home.
She had room for three students.
In 19.16, Mrs. Murray took over
the management of the Women's
Rest Home and it was moved from
Mrs. Owens' home to its present
site. With two single rooms and
four doubles, it can accommodate
10 students, or 13 in an emer
gency.
Once a freshman coed insisted on
continually hanging out the window
to watch the AKL's throwing their
baseball around. Her sickness must
have beome serious — for strangely
enough, she was soon transferred to
the Palo Alto Hospital.
In 1937, Mrs. Hogland became di
rector of the Men's Rest Home. The
men's home, with its two triple
rooms, two doubles, and a single,
can accommodate 11 patients.
Breakfast at 7, confinement to the
beds (with reading, studying, or
letter-writing allowed), phone calls,
but no visitors, are a few of the
rules that govern the homes. Sleep
is the order of the day—and weary
students gladly conform.
Mrs. Hogland reports that the
men have a unique fondness for
hiding things. Pillows are a favor
ite item—they usually get securely
tied up in the sheets. Mrs. Hog
land takes it in good humor, how
ever, and even adds, "They're aw
fully sweet and appreciative."

That was over 25 years ago. Later,
at the meetings of the Stanford
Mothers' Club, the mothers volun
teered to take ill students into their
homes. Soon Mrs. Owen was run
ning the first Stanford Rest Home.
She had room for three students.
In 19.16, Mrs. Murray took over
the management of the Women's
Rest Home and it was moved from
Mrs. Owens' home to its present
site. With two single rooms and
four doubles, it can accommodate
10 students, or 13 in an emer
gency.
Once a freshman coed insisted on
continually hanging out the window
to watch the AKL's throwing their
baseball around. Her sickness must
have beome serious — for strangely
enough, she was soon transferred to
the Palo Alto Hospital.
In 1937, Mrs. Hogland became di
rector of the Men's Rest Home. The
men's home, with its two triple
rooms, two doubles, and a single,
can accommodate 11 patients.
Breakfast at 7, confinement to the
beds (with reading, studying, or
letter-writing allowed), phone calls,
but no visitors, are a few of the
rules that govern the homes. Sleep
is the order of the day—and weary
students gladly conform.
Mrs. Hogland reports that the
men have a unique fondness for
hiding things. Pillows are a favor
ite item—they usually get securely
tied up in the sheets. Mrs. Hog
land takes it in good humor, how
ever, and even adds, "They're aw
fully sweet and appreciative."
Last fall a group of Roblc girls
needed some decorations for a Hal
loween party. Calling upon an En
cina friend (who owned a car), they
roamed the woods, returning hap
pily with armfuls of beautiful red
leaves.
Unfortunately, none of them at
tended the party that night. They
were all in the rest homes with poi
son oak.
Cases like this arc an everyday
occurrence to Mrs. George Murray,
director of the Women's Rest Home,
and to Mrs. Elmer Hogland, director
of the Men's Rest Home.
And poison oak is just one of the
many ailments that students may
be treated for in the two homes on
peaceful, shady Salvatierra Street
here on the Stanford campus.
Mrs. Murray reports that colds
seem to be the most common
trouble among the girls; Mrs.
Hogland says her patients have
ailments ranging from minor ath
letic injuries to the flu. Both
agree that almost all the sick
ness is a result of fatigue brought
on by school life and that what
students need (and get) at the
Rest Home is REST.
At times, Mrs. Hogland has been
invaded by good portions of the
basketball and football teams want
ing no treatment other than a good
night's sleep on Friday nights. (How
can they miss, with lights out at 10
sharp?)
Any weary student, however,
cannot gain admittance to these ha
vens of peace and quiet. (Some stu
dents have the idea that they can
knock on the door and be taken
right in.) The homes are under the
direction of the Health Service and
it is the Health Service alone that
sends students to (and releases
them from) the Rest Homes. Doc
tors from the Service call each day
at the homes and are on immediate
call at all times.
