# Dean Favors Health Plan
## 
### 
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
; higler said yesterday he thought the
I proposed new system of health slips
was a good idea.
j "I am reasonably sure the faculty
will vote to accept the change," Win
bigler said.
The new system would make a
i student's word of illness acceptable
and do away with Health Service
| certificates. Under the present setup
I students must get a certificate to be
j excused from class tests and projects.
The proposal, if passed by the ex
ecutive committee of the Academic
j Council, would mean an extension of
the Fundamental Standard an d
i Honor Code programs.
The change will probably not go
. into effect until winter quarter, be
j cause the Academic Council does rot
j have a regularly scheduled meeting
| again this quarter.
