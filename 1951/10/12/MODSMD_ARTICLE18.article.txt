# A 						New Illness Excuse Plan?
## 
### 
We like the recommendation passed by Ex
corn Wednesday night that would abolish the
existing system of student medical excuses.
The plan proposed by the Student Health
Committee would substitute the students' word
to his instructor as proof of a legitimate medical
absence from class for the present Health Serv
ice certificate setup.
Neither the Student Health Committee nor
Excom wants to appear to be forcing the hand
of the Academic Councils' executive commit
tee, a faculty group which must approve the
plan before it could become operative, but the
nature of the recommendation, in effect, does
just this.
A "no" vote by the faculty group—and this
is unlikely according to Dean Winbigler —
would amount to a contradiction of a couple
of very firm blocks in Stanfords foundation.
Such a vote would appear to run smack against
Stanfords' concept of the integrity of the indi
vidual and its implications, the Fundamental
Standard and the Honor Code.
Such speculation, however, seems unneces
sary since the plan would strengthen the prin
ciple of honor and thus the University, without

any sacrifices on the part of the faculty.
There is no reason to place more or less trust
in a student's word to his instructor than to a
Health Service physician. Medical science is
yet to discover a method of discovering
v/hether a patient was ill yesterday, except in
specific instances.
So the plan offers no "easy way out." It no
more encourages cutting classes than does the
present system.
All things being egual from an ethical stand
point, the problem boils down to this: Should
we continue with an inefficient system?
As conditions are now, students have a long
wait at the Health Service for medical certifi
cates for yesterday's illness. The Health Serv
ice staff wastes valuable time; time that could
be used for what doctors are trained for, treat
ment of patients. And students needing medi
cal attention are forced to wait behind those
who want only a slip of paper.
The Student Health Committee's proposal
would abolish all this. There's an optimistic
trust in the indiivdual implied in their plan, but
there is practical realism, too. —J.M.
