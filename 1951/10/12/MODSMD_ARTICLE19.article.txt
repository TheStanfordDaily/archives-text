*Be kind to all dumb animals,
Give little birds a crumb.
Be kind to human beings too.
They're sometimes pretty dumb."
—Dorothy Parker
Sometime alter high noon today and before game
time Saturday the Stanford campus will be invaded
by a strange race from the southern and less civilized
regions of this state. For those who have never seen
a Ucla, here are a few signs by which they may be

known:
1) livery male will be wearing
a pair of blue denim trousers,
a plaid beach shirt, and a pair
of crepe soled shoes.
2) Every female will be beau
tiful. friendly, and well propor
tioned.
They will travel in objects
resembling automobiles except
that all the vehicles will be con
vertibles painted a metalic ma
roon with two noisy exhaust

pipes.
■J) Their skins will be slightly darker than ours
because of the hot sun in their vast, desert homeland.
Essentially they are harmless, good natured humans
and we must be kind to them. On arriving, they'll be
tired after the long journey and in need of informa
tion. II they look distressed, direct them to one of the
conveniently located, air raid shelter comfort stations.
11 they look thirsty, direct them to the cellar where
they can get a wholesome cup of coffee. If they look
at our girls, tell them to "kiss off": we haven't j.ot
enough for ourselves a.sit is. (Kindness has its limit.-,
vou know )

In providing housing we should go out of our way
to be good hosts. A friendly word or a little con
sideration can make the crowded conditions on cam
pus much easier. For instance, if a Ucla is sleeping
on a downstairs couch or on the soft carpeting, wake
him up and introduce yourself. That's real Stanford
hospitality. If a little girl from the Southland looks the
slightest bit confused, offer her your services. She
might not have a date or maybe she has a friend with
out a date or maybe she's heard of some girl without
a date. There's nothing to be lost either way.
Then let these be our rules of hospitality over the
weekend:
1) Take care not to offend our visitors by laughing
at some of their regional customs.
2) Inform them of the campus functions over the
weekend such as the float parade, rally, open house,
and cactus garden on Friday night.
No lyncliings.
We should be kind, as was said before, because these
gentle people have travelled many hundreds of miles
to sleep on our floors and sit in our drafty sunlight
only to see the Mighty, Mighty Ked Machine crush the
invader:- from the University of California at Los An
geles.. .

Two serious postscripts: UCLA |»ut on a fine time
for its when we went down there last fall. Let's see
if we can top them for hospitality as well as on the
scoreboard.

it is Stanford custom to remove rooter's hats when
the hymn is played. It looks strange to see a white
haired alumni singing bare headed while a freshman
keeps his cap on.
