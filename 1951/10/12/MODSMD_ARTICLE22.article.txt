# Movie 'Orpheus' Is New Twist of Greek Legend

"If you like anchovies.
Then eat them;
It not,
Don't."
â€”Old Greek proverb
Currently playing at the Guild
Theater in Menlo Park is the
French film "Orpheus." The
title comes to us from the Greek
legend of Orpheus, who played
his lyre so beautifully that all
the world listened. But in his
music he forgot his wife. Only
with her death did he discover
the breadth of his love.
To restore her to life, he ven
tured into the underworld and won
| her back with his wonderful talent,
i But Orpheus disobeyed the com
j mandment not to look upon his wife
! and thus lost her and himself to the
, kingdom of the dead.
I The motion picture by Jean Coc
| teau follows the legend in part. But
| to the simple tale Cocteau has in
terjected his own vast and vivid
j imagination. This fact is either the
\ picture's damnation or salvation.
! whichever you want, for with his
; imagination goes any one logical
interpretation of what the story
means.
In Cocleau's picture Death is a

| woman who drives in a limousine
escorted by two uniformed servants
on motorcyles. She is also in love
with Orpheus. Death's chauffeur is
in love with the poet's wife; the
mirror is the portal of the dead; the
line between life and the other
world grows vague. One advantage
of the picture is that you can come
; in the beginning, the middle, or the
end and still be confused.
However, some of the effects that
j the French artist has achieved are
! masterful. The way that Death and
her cohorts walk through mirrors
: and descend via a surrealist back
| ground to the judging place of the
! dead will prick your imagination.
The dialogue (titles) is generally
| good, sometimes superb. The act
j ing was fine.
One quote from the picture seems
j to sum up the producer's senti
! ments. It is one that Death's chauf
! feur speaks to Orpheus when the
j puzzled mortal asks a bewildered
| "How?"
J The chauffeur says, "It is not nec
j cessary to understand; it is neces
sary only to believe."
If you'll go to .see "Orpheus" as
' an adventure in imagination and
I imagery and not expect to fully un-
I derstand, and not expect the usual
i form of the American "flick," you
| might well enjoy the picture. If
not, "Rhubarb" is a good picture
too.
