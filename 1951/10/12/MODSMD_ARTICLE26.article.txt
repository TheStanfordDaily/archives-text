## The 						Sporting Line

Well, how does the PCC race shape up now after last v/eekend's
key games are grid history? Only thing lor sure is that the little
ol' Indian has added another scalp and it looks as if the Red Ma
chine is shifting into second and picking up speed.
While world-traveler Grothe was off taking in the Card-Michi-

gan game, I had the misfortune of
being in the vicinity of Strawberry
Canyon on Saturday afternoon. It
was unfortunate because almost ev
erybody in Memorial Stadium, and
that includes the Cal rooters, was
bored with the methodical butchery
of the hapless Gopher bv the mighty
Golden Bear.
Cal Really Has 11
One solid observation can come
from Saturday's debacle and that's
this: Cal really has it this year.
Nearly perfect blocking and tack
ling. T r emendous interference.
Plays that are planned to go all the
way all the time. Johnny O.. at least j
i'.i that game, is not overrated. He's j
a human tank. But why worry, for j
there's no greater equalizer than j
the Big Game. The record book j
shows that.
'1 he biggest weekend develop- |
rncnt was USC's neat upset of the i
favored Washington Huskies in thei
favored Washington Huskies in
their own Seattle lair. Jess Hill's
boys gave every indication that the i
'51 team is about ready to shake
off the Blundering Herd monicker
and return to their glorious past
and the Thundering Herd days. As 1
staled before, that defensive line
with Pat Cannamela backing up
can anJ will be mighty rough. The 1
Huskies managed a tremendous 72
yards on the ground.
As for this Saturday's opponents, \
the Ba!>y Blue Bruins, nothing :
now cart be made of their last per- j
lormance. UCLA whipped Santa :
Clara. The field temp was only in 1
thÂ£ 120's and the Bruins did most j
of their scoring in the wilting sec- I
ond half. Paul Cameron, the soph i
whiz, as predicted, was the stand- j
out. The Westwooders still are j
small and not deep. They are a team |
that can score plenty of ponits, as
Card scout Dutch Fehring will tes- [
tlfy. But to quote an old song, their j
defenses are down. Let's get hot, j
Big Red, and take these guys.
Grucials Ahead
All in all, it looks like Stanford's
two vital games on the remaining
schedule are both played away. !
Washington at Seattle and SC in
Los Angeles. This, of course, is good j
and bad. The Huskies are always j
tough at home. The Cards usually
play the best ball of the year in the j
Coliseum. So, hurry and make res
ervations for the SC game right!
away. The. PCC pot is boiling and |
the Cards are beginning to jell.
