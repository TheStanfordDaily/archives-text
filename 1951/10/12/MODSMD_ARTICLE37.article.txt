# UCLA Game to Feature Rally Com Card Stunts
## 
### RUBY BERNSTEIN 
"One, two, three, everybody
down. One, two, three, every
body flip."
These words will signal to ac
tion the 2,000 Farm roughs who
make up the Stanford card stunt
section at the UCLA game to
morrow.
t In the 20-minute break during in
termission, the UCLA fans across
the field will sec 17 card stunts.
But many people don't realize the
time put in to produce these human
pictures at each major football tilt.
Producing card stunts is not a
simple process. It calls for handling
by two Rally Com committees: the
art committee and the stunt commit
tee. An average of 60 persons work
one and a half to two hours each
day plotting the pictures and laying
the ground work before the picture
process can be moved to the field.
Ideas for UCLA game stunts
were gathered two weeks ago.
The art committee, which meets
every Saturday morning, starts
the process. The committee's main
job is to create stunts for the fol
lowing week's game.
Ideas are drawn on graph paper,
using the scale of one square repre
senting one seat. The diagrams
measure 40 scats across by 50 rows
up, totaling 2,000.
At this point, the intended stunt
looks like an argyle sock pattern.
Patterns are finished the Monday
or Tuesday before the game. When
actual drawing of the stunts is com
pleted, the card stunt committee
takes over.
They have the tedious job of
stamping instruction cards to coin
cide with the art designs. The cards
are checked and rechecked against
the graph design to kill any chance
of error. The probability of error,
according to Sherm Telleen, card
stunt chairman, is thus made very
small.
Next comes setting up the cards.
Saturday morning before the game,
Rally Com moves to the stadium
with patterns, cards, and instruc- !
tions.
Hangers have been installed un

der each seat of the card section to
facilitate attaching the cards. Four
cards, a total of eight colors, arc se
cured under each seat.
This year metallic cards will not
he used. They arc very expensive
and since the budget was cut, a
smaller, thinner card had to he
purchased.
For out-of-town games like the
coming USC tilt, the committees
must have their plans worked out
well in advance. All materials they
will need, including the 2,000 cards,
must be carted down south. Getting
organized out of town is more diffi
cult, too, varying with the setup of
the stadium.
There is a technique for making
card stunts more attractive for the
cross-field audience.
Telleen gives this advice:
"Students should sit directly in
line within the white paint mark
ings of the scats in the section.
Then the only problem is holding
the cards straight for a neat pic

tu re."
Tomorrow, as half-time ends anrl
the Stanford tree has grown over
the "S," the rooting section's work
will be over for another week.
But for Rally Com it's just the j
beginning of next week's work.

up, totaling 2,000.
At this point, the intended stunt
looks like an argyle sock pattern.
Patterns are finished the Monday
or Tuesday before the game. When
actual drawing of the stunts is com
pleted, the card stunt committee
takes over.
They have the tedious job of
stamping instruction cards to coin
cide with the art designs. The cards
are checked and rechecked against
the graph design to kill any chance
of error. The probability of error,
according to Sherm Telleen, card
stunt chairman, is thus made very
small.
Next comes setting up the cards.
Saturday morning before the game,
Rally Com moves to the stadium
with patterns, cards, and instruc- !
tions.
Hangers have been installed un

der each seat of the card section to
facilitate attaching the cards. Four
cards, a total of eight colors, arc se
cured under each seat.
This year metallic cards will not
he used. They arc very expensive
and since the budget was cut, a
smaller, thinner card had to he
purchased.
For out-of-town games like the
coming USC tilt, the committees
must have their plans worked out
well in advance. All materials they
will need, including the 2,000 cards,
must be carted down south. Getting
organized out of town is more diffi
cult, too, varying with the setup of
the stadium.
There is a technique for making
card stunts more attractive for the
cross-field audience.
Telleen gives this advice:
"Students should sit directly in
line within the white paint mark
ings of the scats in the section.
Then the only problem is holding
the cards straight for a neat pic

tu re."
Tomorrow, as half-time ends anrl
the Stanford tree has grown over
the "S," the rooting section's work
will be over for another week.
But for Rally Com it's just the j
beginning of next week's work.


CAL'S ROOTING SECTION—This fighting football player was
formed at last year's Big Game as one of the card stunts put on
by the Bears' rooters. Tomorrow Stanford's rooting section will
display similar stunts.
"One, two, three, everybody
down. One, two, three, every
body flip."
These words will signal to ac
tion the 2,000 Farm roughs who
make up the Stanford card stunt
section at the UCLA game to
morrow.
t In the 20-minute break during in
termission, the UCLA fans across
the field will sec 17 card stunts.
But many people don't realize the
time put in to produce these human
pictures at each major football tilt.
Producing card stunts is not a
simple process. It calls for handling
by two Rally Com committees: the
art committee and the stunt commit
tee. An average of 60 persons work
one and a half to two hours each
day plotting the pictures and laying
the ground work before the picture
process can be moved to the field.
Ideas for UCLA game stunts
were gathered two weeks ago.
The art committee, which meets
every Saturday morning, starts
the process. The committee's main
job is to create stunts for the fol
lowing week's game.
Ideas are drawn on graph paper,
using the scale of one square repre
senting one seat. The diagrams
measure 40 scats across by 50 rows
up, totaling 2,000.
