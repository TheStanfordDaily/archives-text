# Extra Rebate Payments Due
## Bookstore Uncovers Unexpected Surplus 
### 
As a result of an unexpected
surplus profit, the Stanford
Bookstore has declared an ad
ditional seven and a half per
cent rebate on last year's sales.
The announcement of the in
crease, bringing last year's rebate
to a total of C 2, per cent, was made
yesterday by Business School Dean
J. Hugh Jackson, president of the
Bookstore Board of Directors.
The surplus profit was discovered
when the annual audit was made at
the Bookstore the first of this
month. The additional rebate was
declared at, the Oct. 2 meeting of the
Board of Directors.
The additional rebate will bo
disbursed as soon as the early
quarter Bookstore rush is com
pleted and arrangements can be
made for the payment of the divi
dend.
Mrs. Helena Bauchou, manager of
the Bookstore, voiced the hope that
the money could be paid to the
students and faculty early in No
vember. Announcement of the ex
act payment period will appear in
The Daily.
Students will be able to pick up
their additional rebate money by
calling at the Bookstore after that
announcement. Mrs. Bauchou said
that students who arc not back at
Stanford this year to collect, their
money will be contacted individu
ally later.
Dean Jackson explained that a
summer sales slump, predicted
last May, did not occur; and for
that reason a surplus fund is
available for the second "patron
age dividend."
He pointed out that since the
store's fiscal year closes Sept. 1,
only an estimate of the yearly prof
it.*, and thus an estimate of the re
bate, can be made in May. This
year, the estimate was based on an
expected decrease in summer en
rollment which did not take place.
The president of the Board of Di
rectors also said that several times
a similar situation has necessitated
the declaration of a second rebate
after the losing of the fiscal year.
Such an occurrence is, in his words,
"quite a customary thing."
The 22' 2 per rent total rebate,
however, is not the highest ever
awarded by the llookstorc. Dur
ing the peak enrollment years of
l!U(i and 1017, a 25 per cent re*

, bate was paid. Since thai time
the yearly payment has never
i been less than 20 per cent, save
i for last May's rebate.
i The new T'/a per cent rebate will
give last year's bookstore customers
I half again as much rebate money as
last May, and it will make the final
I rebate fund for the year total almost
| $100,000.
In addition to that sum turned
back to the students in the form of
} the patronage dividend, the Book
j store Board of Directors voted in
their Oct. 2 meeting to give $10,000
j to the Bookstore loan and scholar
| ship fund.
That fund was established in 1935
] when the Bookstore first began to
make profits after the depression.
At that time, a student, body elec
| tion determined the founding of the
j fund. Today, the loan fund stands
at $24,000 and the scholarship fund
j in excess of $40,000.
This, plus the total of rebate
money since the store's founding on
a $. r >oo loan from President. David
Starr .Jordan in 1807, makes a total
|of more than a million dollars
! which the Bookstore has turned
! back into students' pockets during
| the last 50 years.

As a result of an unexpected
surplus profit, the Stanford
Bookstore has declared an ad
ditional seven and a half per
cent rebate on last year's sales.
The announcement of the in
crease, bringing last year's rebate
to a total of C 2, per cent, was made
yesterday by Business School Dean
J. Hugh Jackson, president of the
Bookstore Board of Directors.
The surplus profit was discovered
when the annual audit was made at
the Bookstore the first of this
month. The additional rebate was
declared at, the Oct. 2 meeting of the
Board of Directors.
The additional rebate will bo
disbursed as soon as the early
quarter Bookstore rush is com
pleted and arrangements can be
made for the payment of the divi
dend.
Mrs. Helena Bauchou, manager of
the Bookstore, voiced the hope that
the money could be paid to the
students and faculty early in No
vember. Announcement of the ex
act payment period will appear in
The Daily.
Students will be able to pick up
their additional rebate money by
calling at the Bookstore after that
announcement. Mrs. Bauchou said
that students who arc not back at
Stanford this year to collect, their
money will be contacted individu
ally later.
Dean Jackson explained that a
summer sales slump, predicted
last May, did not occur; and for
that reason a surplus fund is
available for the second "patron
age dividend."
He pointed out that since the
store's fiscal year closes Sept. 1,
only an estimate of the yearly prof
it.*, and thus an estimate of the re
bate, can be made in May. This
year, the estimate was based on an
expected decrease in summer en
rollment which did not take place.
The president of the Board of Di
rectors also said that several times
a similar situation has necessitated
the declaration of a second rebate
after the losing of the fiscal year.
Such an occurrence is, in his words,
"quite a customary thing."
The 22' 2 per rent total rebate,
however, is not the highest ever
awarded by the llookstorc. Dur
ing the peak enrollment years of
l!U(i and 1017, a 25 per cent re*

, bate was paid. Since thai time
the yearly payment has never
i been less than 20 per cent, save
i for last May's rebate.
i The new T'/a per cent rebate will
give last year's bookstore customers
I half again as much rebate money as
last May, and it will make the final
I rebate fund for the year total almost
| $100,000.
In addition to that sum turned
back to the students in the form of
} the patronage dividend, the Book
j store Board of Directors voted in
their Oct. 2 meeting to give $10,000
j to the Bookstore loan and scholar
| ship fund.
That fund was established in 1935
] when the Bookstore first began to
make profits after the depression.
At that time, a student, body elec
| tion determined the founding of the
j fund. Today, the loan fund stands
at $24,000 and the scholarship fund
j in excess of $40,000.
This, plus the total of rebate
money since the store's founding on
a $. r >oo loan from President. David
Starr .Jordan in 1807, makes a total
|of more than a million dollars
! which the Bookstore has turned
! back into students' pockets during
| the last 50 years.
