# STANFORD, UCLA TANGLE IN 'CRUCIAL'
## Mathias to Start for Revenge-Minded Cards 
### PETE GROTHE 
The PCC Rose Bowl representative may be decided in Stanford's
big brown bowl tomorrow.
Staniord is the host, UCLA the intruder, and offense and more
offense should be the keynote when the kids in cardinal and white
lock horns with the powderpuff-blue Bruins. Starting time is 2 p.m.

Although several other teams are
in the run for the roses, the outfit
that emerges victor tomorrow will
stand a good chance of going all the
way. The loser will have tough
sledding.
The Bruins will be slight under
dogs, but that is nothing new to
them. Coach Red Sanders' gridders
were underdogs two years ago.
They won, 14 to 7. They were
underdogs last season. They won,
21 to 7. Stanford has gone into the
UCLA contests the past two years
with whopping good records. The
Indians were given good chances to
get to the Rose Bowl, and both
times UCLA played spoiler.
Stanford once more has an un
defeated record and can faintly
smell roses from Pasadena way.
Deke Hmilgate, a nationally rec
ognized prognosticator, thinks so
highly of • Chuck Taylor's crew
that he pirks it eighth in the na
tion.
UCLA doesn't think Stanford is
eighth in the oation, and they are
sending up o7 football players and
3.500 rooters to try to prove that
they aren't.
The Cards, remembering the past
two years, want to beat the fellas
with the Pershing Square blue jer
seys in the most violent sort of
way. UCLA represents a pest that
has to be done away with.
The Westwooders in the past two
years haven't won on sheer strength
and might. They've been nuisances
and opportunists, capitalizing on
breaks and converting those breaks
into touchdowns and eventually
victory.
Sanders has 21 veterans return
ing from last year's oufit and has
put together an offense that out
does anything he has had the past
two seasons. The Bruins muscled
Santa 'Clara out of the stadium
last week. 44 to 17, and gave the
Broncs their worst setback in 23
years. A record like that has to
he respected.
The Uclans dropped close contests
to Illinois and Texas A&M. Illinois
is one of the teams favored to win
the Big Ten title, and Texas A&M is
reputed to be the best team in the
Southwest, so UCLA didn't lose to
inferior opposition.
The score was tied, 14 to 14, in
the Texas A&M tussle in the fourth
quarter. UCLA missed a first down
by inches on the Texan six-yard.
Dutch Fehring, who scoutcd the
Westwooders for Stanford, thinks
the Bruins would have won, were
it not for that break.
Fehring told the team, "I have a
very healthy respect "or UCLA, and
unless we improve, we aren't going
to beat them. They have one of the
best sophomore backs I have ever
seen in Paul Cameron and an out
standing end in Ernie Stockcrt."
Cameron, the starting left half.

J leads the PCC in total offense.
He has cone 011 land for 277 yards
and in the air for 337 for an im
pressive fil4 total. lie has direct
ly accounted for eight of UCLA's
11 touchdowns and has completed
24 passes in 32 attempts for a .750
average. Stanford's pass defense,
which, statistically, is second in
the league, will receive a thor
; ough test.
The Bruins have other offensive
| guns. Stockert, a six-foot five-inch
! glue - fingered receiver, is second
! only to Bill McColl. They have bet-
I ter-than-average fullbacks in Lu
ther Keyes and Bill Stits. They
I have three wing-footed right, half
j backs in Joe Sabol, Pete Dailey, and
I Don Stalwick.
Bob Moore is described by Feh
j ring as "the best college punter I
have ever seen." And Sanders calls
; quarterback Julie Weisstein the
best blocking hack he has had. But
I the 179-pound, six-foot Cameron is
| the big man for the Stanford de
fense to concentrate 011.
UCLA, on the other hand, has the
worst defensive record in the PCC,
land it is well known that, the kids
1 from the Farm have a galaxy of
| offensive weapons to keep the Bru-
I ins' defensive record a poor one.
j The extent to which the Card at
| tack rolls into high gear will de-
J pend on the physical shape of All
| American linebacker Donn Moo
maw and captain and tackle Hal
Mitchell. Both won't be in top
| shape, if thev plav at all. Also
shelved for the Uclans is tailback
I Ted Narleski, Stanford's un - doer
last year.
Those who saw the Michigan
game now know that there is no
defense for McColl. He'll he
humped at the line of scrimmage,
and a forest of pass defenders will
| climb on him like monkeys, but
still he'll catch passes. He'll also
give ends Bill Storum and Sam
Morley plenty of opportunity to
1 get into the open.
When the UCLA defense has been
! opened up, watch for Eric South
: wood, Harry Hugasian, Ron Cook,
Bob Bryan, Bob Mathias, and Wes
| Laubschcr to carry the mail. That
I was the scheme of battle at Ann
! Arbor last week.
Southwood was the top ground
1 gainer last week, having covered
99 yards. If practice sessions this
week mean anything, he'll be fan
cy-stepping the Bruins bug-eyed.
Skip Crist, junior fullback, is def
| initely out, and Bob Meyers prob
| ably won't play. That means that
Bob Mathias will be under pressure
at fullback. But as Palo Alto Times
j sports editor Walt Gamage pointed
1 out, Mathias is used to pressure.
| When someone wins the world's
I decathlon championship at the age
I of 17, that's the alpha and omega
| of pressure.
Laubscher, built like a fire hy
drant, was ticketed to be first-string
halfback early this fall, until he
hurt his ankle. He is in good shape
i again and has shown to good ad
vantage in practice. The loss of
Meyers, and ..Crist .luirts, though.
Chuck Taylor, incidentally, goes
I into the contest never having lost
a game in 16 contests as frosh men
i tor and three as varsity coach.

The PCC Rose Bowl representative may be decided in Stanford's
big brown bowl tomorrow.
Staniord is the host, UCLA the intruder, and offense and more
offense should be the keynote when the kids in cardinal and white
lock horns with the powderpuff-blue Bruins. Starting time is 2 p.m.

Although several other teams are
in the run for the roses, the outfit
that emerges victor tomorrow will
stand a good chance of going all the
way. The loser will have tough
sledding.
The Bruins will be slight under
dogs, but that is nothing new to
them. Coach Red Sanders' gridders
were underdogs two years ago.
They won, 14 to 7. They were
underdogs last season. They won,
21 to 7. Stanford has gone into the
UCLA contests the past two years
with whopping good records. The
Indians were given good chances to
get to the Rose Bowl, and both
times UCLA played spoiler.
Stanford once more has an un
defeated record and can faintly
smell roses from Pasadena way.
Deke Hmilgate, a nationally rec
ognized prognosticator, thinks so
highly of • Chuck Taylor's crew
that he pirks it eighth in the na
tion.
UCLA doesn't think Stanford is
eighth in the oation, and they are
sending up o7 football players and
3.500 rooters to try to prove that
they aren't.
The Cards, remembering the past
two years, want to beat the fellas
with the Pershing Square blue jer
seys in the most violent sort of
way. UCLA represents a pest that
has to be done away with.
The Westwooders in the past two
years haven't won on sheer strength
and might. They've been nuisances
and opportunists, capitalizing on
breaks and converting those breaks
into touchdowns and eventually
victory.
Sanders has 21 veterans return
ing from last year's oufit and has
put together an offense that out
does anything he has had the past
two seasons. The Bruins muscled
Santa 'Clara out of the stadium
last week. 44 to 17, and gave the
Broncs their worst setback in 23
years. A record like that has to
he respected.
The Uclans dropped close contests
to Illinois and Texas A&M. Illinois
is one of the teams favored to win
the Big Ten title, and Texas A&M is
reputed to be the best team in the
Southwest, so UCLA didn't lose to
inferior opposition.
The score was tied, 14 to 14, in
the Texas A&M tussle in the fourth
quarter. UCLA missed a first down
by inches on the Texan six-yard.
Dutch Fehring, who scoutcd the
Westwooders for Stanford, thinks
the Bruins would have won, were
it not for that break.
Fehring told the team, "I have a
very healthy respect "or UCLA, and
unless we improve, we aren't going
to beat them. They have one of the
best sophomore backs I have ever
seen in Paul Cameron and an out
standing end in Ernie Stockcrt."
Cameron, the starting left half.

J leads the PCC in total offense.
He has cone 011 land for 277 yards
and in the air for 337 for an im
pressive fil4 total. lie has direct
ly accounted for eight of UCLA's
11 touchdowns and has completed
24 passes in 32 attempts for a .750
average. Stanford's pass defense,
which, statistically, is second in
the league, will receive a thor
; ough test.
The Bruins have other offensive
| guns. Stockert, a six-foot five-inch
! glue - fingered receiver, is second
! only to Bill McColl. They have bet-
I ter-than-average fullbacks in Lu
ther Keyes and Bill Stits. They
I have three wing-footed right, half
j backs in Joe Sabol, Pete Dailey, and
I Don Stalwick.
Bob Moore is described by Feh
j ring as "the best college punter I
have ever seen." And Sanders calls
; quarterback Julie Weisstein the
best blocking hack he has had. But
I the 179-pound, six-foot Cameron is
| the big man for the Stanford de
fense to concentrate 011.
UCLA, on the other hand, has the
worst defensive record in the PCC,
land it is well known that, the kids
1 from the Farm have a galaxy of
| offensive weapons to keep the Bru-
I ins' defensive record a poor one.
j The extent to which the Card at

J pend on the physical shape of All

Those who saw the Michigan

Southwood was the top ground

Skip Crist, junior fullback, is def

The PCC Rose Bowl representative may be decided in Stanford's
big brown bowl tomorrow.
Staniord is the host, UCLA the intruder, and offense and more
offense should be the keynote when the kids in cardinal and white
lock horns with the powderpuff-blue Bruins. Starting time is 2 p.m.

Although several other teams are
in the run for the roses, the outfit
that emerges victor tomorrow will
stand a good chance of going all the
way. The loser will have tough
sledding.
The Bruins will be slight under
dogs, but that is nothing new to
them. Coach Red Sanders' gridders
were underdogs two years ago.
They won, 14 to 7. They were
underdogs last season. They won,
21 to 7. Stanford has gone into the
UCLA contests the past two years
with whopping good records. The
Indians were given good chances to
get to the Rose Bowl, and both
times UCLA played spoiler.
Stanford once more has an un
defeated record and can faintly
smell roses from Pasadena way.
Deke Hmilgate, a nationally rec
ognized prognosticator, thinks so
highly of • Chuck Taylor's crew
that he pirks it eighth in the na
tion.
UCLA doesn't think Stanford is
eighth in the oation, and they are
sending up o7 football players and
3.500 rooters to try to prove that
they aren't.
The Cards, remembering the past
two years, want to beat the fellas
with the Pershing Square blue jer
seys in the most violent sort of
way. UCLA represents a pest that
has to be done away with.
The Westwooders in the past two
years haven't won on sheer strength
and might. They've been nuisances
and opportunists, capitalizing on
breaks and converting those breaks
into touchdowns and eventually
victory.
Sanders has 21 veterans return
ing from last year's oufit and has
put together an offense that out
does anything he has had the past
two seasons. The Bruins muscled
Santa 'Clara out of the stadium
last week. 44 to 17, and gave the
Broncs their worst setback in 23
years. A record like that has to
he respected.
The Uclans dropped close contests
to Illinois and Texas A&M. Illinois
is one of the teams favored to win
the Big Ten title, and Texas A&M is
reputed to be the best team in the
Southwest, so UCLA didn't lose to
inferior opposition.
The score was tied, 14 to 14, in
the Texas A&M tussle in the fourth
quarter. UCLA missed a first down
by inches on the Texan six-yard.
Dutch Fehring, who scoutcd the
Westwooders for Stanford, thinks
the Bruins would have won, were
it not for that break.
Fehring told the team, "I have a
very healthy respect "or UCLA, and
unless we improve, we aren't going
to beat them. They have one of the
best sophomore backs I have ever
seen in Paul Cameron and an out

put together an offense that out
does anything he has had the past
two seasons. The Bruins muscled
Santa 'Clara out of the stadium
last week. 44 to 17, and gave the
Broncs their worst setback in 23
years. A record like that has to
he respected.
The Uclans dropped close contests
to Illinois and Texas A&M. Illinois
is one of the teams favored to win
the Big Ten title, and Texas A&M is
reputed to be the best team in the
Southwest, so UCLA didn't lose to
inferior opposition.
The score was tied, 14 to 14, in
the Texas A&M tussle in the fourth
quarter. UCLA missed a first down
by inches on the Texan six-yard.
Dutch Fehring, who scoutcd the
Westwooders for Stanford, thinks
the Bruins would have won, were
it not for that break.
Fehring told the team, "I have a
very healthy respect "or UCLA, and
unless we improve, we aren't going
to beat them. They have one of the
best sophomore backs I have ever
seen in Paul Cameron and an out
standing end in Ernie Stockcrt."
Cameron, the starting left half.

J leads the PCC in total offense.
He has cone 011 land for 277 yards
and in the air for 337 for an im
pressive fil4 total. lie has direct
ly accounted for eight of UCLA's
11 touchdowns and has completed
24 passes in 32 attempts for a .750
average. Stanford's pass defense,
which, statistically, is second in
the league, will receive a thor
; ough test.
The Bruins have other offensive
| guns. Stockert, a six-foot five-inch
! glue - fingered receiver, is second
! only to Bill McColl. They have bet-
I ter-than-average fullbacks in Lu
ther Keyes and Bill Stits. They
I have three wing-footed right, half
j backs in Joe Sabol, Pete Dailey, and
I Don Stalwick.
Bob Moore is described by Feh
j ring as "the best college punter I
have ever seen." And Sanders calls
; quarterback Julie Weisstein the
best blocking hack he has had. But
I the 179-pound, six-foot Cameron is
| the big man for the Stanford de
fense to concentrate 011.
UCLA, on the other hand, has the
worst defensive record in the PCC,
land it is well known that, the kids
1 from the Farm have a galaxy of
| offensive weapons to keep the Bru-
I ins' defensive record a poor one.
j The extent to which the Card at
| tack rolls into high gear will de-
J pend on the physical shape of All
| American linebacker Donn Moo
maw and captain and tackle Hal
Mitchell. Both won't be in top
| shape, if thev plav at all. Also
shelved for the Uclans is tailback
I Ted Narleski, Stanford's un - doer
last year.
Those who saw the Michigan
game now know that there is no
defense for McColl. He'll he
humped at the line of scrimmage,
and a forest of pass defenders will
| climb on him like monkeys, but
still he'll catch passes. He'll also
give ends Bill Storum and Sam
Morley plenty of opportunity to
1 get into the open.
When the UCLA defense has been
! opened up, watch for Eric South
: wood, Harry Hugasian, Ron Cook,
Bob Bryan, Bob Mathias, and Wes
| Laubschcr to carry the mail. That
I was the scheme of battle at Ann
! Arbor last week.
Southwood was the top ground
1 gainer last week, having covered
99 yards. If practice sessions this
week mean anything, he'll be fan
cy-stepping the Bruins bug-eyed.
Skip Crist, junior fullback, is def
| initely out, and Bob Meyers prob
| ably won't play. That means that
Bob Mathias will be under pressure
at fullback. But as Palo Alto Times
j sports editor Walt Gamage pointed
1 out, Mathias is used to pressure.
| When someone wins the world's
I decathlon championship at the age
I of 17, that's the alpha and omega
| of pressure.
Laubscher, built like a fire hy
drant, was ticketed to be first-string
halfback early this fall, until he
hurt his ankle. He is in good shape
i again and has shown to good ad
vantage in practice. The loss of
Meyers, and ..Crist .luirts, though.
Chuck Taylor, incidentally, goes
I into the contest never having lost
a game in 16 contests as frosh men
i tor and three as varsity coach.
