# Hospitality Shown To Bruin Bondswomen

The Off-Campus Women's Club
came to Cardinals' rescue this
weekend and solved their prob
lem of how to house the 18 wom
en members of the UCLA band.
The Farm fraternities had of
fered to host the bandsmen, but
Cardinals was stumped when it
came to shelter for the women
musicians. A plea to the Off-
Campus Women resulted in food,
housing, and transportation to
and from campus for the girls.
