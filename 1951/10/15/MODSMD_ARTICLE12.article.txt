## 
### 
A one-story leap will cost Ned

of his legs for a period of one to
three months, doctors told him this
weekend.
Wilson injured both heel hones
while taking part in a water bag
fight at Encina last week. The in
jury was severe enough to put him
in Palo Alto Hospital for what staff
members termed "at least a month
and probably longer."
From his hospital bed, Wilson
urged his friends at Encina to
"think twice before having that
water bag fight."
The injury will keep Wilson out
of school for fall quarter and will
also curtail his plans to participate
