# Team Effort Gets 4th Win
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
The Red Indian had to wait
three years to trounce UCLA, but
when he did it, he did it with
satisfying completeness, 21 to 7,
and no one can deny that there's
a faint aroma of roses on the
Farm this morning.
It was a TEAM victory all the way
through. When Bill McColl wasn't
accepting a Gary Kerkorian pass with
three defenders clawing at him, it
was Eric Southwood fancy-stepping
off-tackle for 15 yards. When it
wasn't Southwood, it was Boh Ma
thias, the world's greatest athlete,
galloping 28 yards around right end.
And when it wasn't Mathias it was
Harry Hugasian fighting, squirming
his way up the middle for 14, or Boh
Meyers, playing with a painful
shoulder pointer, kicking 45 yards to
the UCLA four. The strong blocking
was also important in the TEAM ef
fort.
Applying the pressure when
they had to, which was constantly,
the defence continued where the
offense left off. Chuck Taylor's
plan of attack was immediately to
rush Paul Cameron and make him
either run or throw the hall right
away. The result was that the
UCLA soph sensation was stilled
as he has never hcen stifled before.
He ran 20 times, only averaging
two yards a carry, and completed
only five out of IK passes, although
several were dropped.
But if one back had to be singled
out for Stanford, it would probably
he the 204 pound, six-foot-three, Ma
thias. The Tulare flash had Stan
ford's best average, gaining 49 yards
in seven attempts for a seven yard
average. He tallied Stanford's last
two touchdowns, not bad for some
one playing his first collegiate game
(discount the two kick-off returns
last week.)
Dr. and Mrs. Mathias were in the
stands, and they said that the only
time that they were prouder of their
son was when he won the Olympic
decathalon championship at the age
of 17.
The Cards, undefeated in four trips
from the barn, took the opening
kick-off to the 23, and Southwood
and the Hipster combined to move
the ball to the UCLA 43. Here was
where tackle Ed Miller recovered an
Indian fumble, and Stanford rooters
poignantly recalled the pattern in the
last two Bruin games when the West
wooders had taken advantage of such
breaks to win.
Nothing of the sort came to pass,
and 45 seconds into the second
quarter Stanford had a hig fat
seven on the scoreboard. It was
the result of a 46 yard drive which
j Kerkorian pieced together with
workmanlike precision. South
j wood, the pre-med student with
! the high knee action, and Hugasian
were the workhorses of the drive,
and the 183-pound Armenian from
! Pasadena boomed right guard for
the final yard.
The Cards threatened twice more
i in the second quarter, but an alert
: 4-4 UCLA defense held off the In
j dians, and fourth-down field goal at
j tempts by McColl were short.
Half way into the third quarter,
| the kids in the powderpuff blufe dis
played the offense that gave Santa
Clara its worse beating in 23 .years
(44 to 17) and drove 81 yardstfdr a
; score. Cameron passed or ran -for
j most of the yardage and contributed
j the final three and a half yards on
a jaunt around left end. Center
I Gayle Pace converted out of Don
I Stalwick's hold, and it was a new
| game.
But the hysterical Bruin rooting
section from across the way wa"s sud
1 denly muted, as the high-powered
Big Red Machine rolled 80 yards.
Stanford was penalized to its own
I 14, and here was where Kerkorian,
j who completed 8 out of 12, wheeled
I back to pass. He let go a floater to
I the Stanford 45 where McColl made
an ail-American catch in a forest of
four (4) defenders. Taylor described
j that as the turning point of the game.
The show was all Kerkorian's
as he hurled beautifully to Soufh
j wood for 2(i, rifled a bullet pass
eight yards to Cook, and pitched a
15 yarder to McColl who made an
other impossible catch on the 5.
Shades of Michigan. And here was
Cook, the soph flash, experimenting
I at right guard for three and Ma
| thias ripping off-tackle for two and
| a touchdown. Kerkorian's kick
; made it 14 to 7. but the Great Re
venge was going to result in still
another tally.
Cook and Mathias rolled up 62
j yards in seven cracks for the final
| score. Cook sneaked through left
| guard for seven, then for three, and
; then off left tackle for 13. Enter Bob
Mathias. Mathias, barrelled around
right end. followed his interference
j nicely, churned loose from several
I would-be tacklers, and proceeded 28
j yards to the nine. He scored three
plays later.
The statistics give foundation to
1 Stanford's scoreboard superiority.
The Indians totaled 403 yards, as
compared to the Bruins' 273.

The Red Indian had to wait
three years to trounce UCLA, but
when he did it, he did it with
satisfying completeness, 21 to 7,
and no one can deny that there's
a faint aroma of roses on the
Farm this morning.
It was a TEAM victory all the way
through. When Bill McColl wasn't
accepting a Gary Kerkorian pass with
three defenders clawing at him, it
was Eric Southwood fancy-stepping
off-tackle for 15 yards. When it
wasn't Southwood, it was Boh Ma
thias, the world's greatest athlete,
galloping 28 yards around right end.
And when it wasn't Mathias it was
Harry Hugasian fighting, squirming
his way up the middle for 14, or Boh
Meyers, playing with a painful
shoulder pointer, kicking 45 yards to
the UCLA four. The strong blocking
was also important in the TEAM ef
fort.
Applying the pressure when
they had to, which was constantly,
the defence continued where the
offense left off. Chuck Taylor's
plan of attack was immediately to
rush Paul Cameron and make him
either run or throw the hall right
away. The result was that the
UCLA soph sensation was stilled
as he has never hcen stifled before.
He ran 20 times, only averaging
two yards a carry, and completed
only five out of IK passes, although
several were dropped.
But if one back had to be singled
out for Stanford, it would probably
he the 204 pound, six-foot-three, Ma
thias. The Tulare flash had Stan
ford's best average, gaining 49 yards
in seven attempts for a seven yard
average. He tallied Stanford's last
two touchdowns, not bad for some
one playing his first collegiate game
(discount the two kick-off returns
last week.)
Dr. and Mrs. Mathias were in the
stands, and they said that the only
time that they were prouder of their
son was when he won the Olympic
decathalon championship at the age
of 17.
The Cards, undefeated in four trips
from the barn, took the opening
kick-off to the 23, and Southwood
and the Hipster combined to move
the ball to the UCLA 43. Here was
where tackle Ed Miller recovered an
Indian fumble, and Stanford rooters
poignantly recalled the pattern in the
last two Bruin games when the West
wooders had taken advantage of such
breaks to win.
Nothing of the sort came to pass,
and 45 seconds into the second
quarter Stanford had a hig fat
seven on the scoreboard. It was
the result of a 46 yard drive which
j Kerkorian pieced together with
workmanlike precision. South
j wood, the pre-med student with
! the high knee action, and Hugasian
were the workhorses of the drive,
and the 183-pound Armenian from
! Pasadena boomed right guard for
the final yard.
The Cards threatened twice more
i in the second quarter, but an alert
: 4-4 UCLA defense held off the In
j dians, and fourth-down field goal at
j tempts by McColl were short.

The Red Indian had to wait
three years to trounce UCLA, but
when he did it, he did it with
satisfying completeness, 21 to 7,
and no one can deny that there's
a faint aroma of roses on the
Farm this morning.
It was a TEAM victory all the way
through. When Bill McColl wasn't
accepting a Gary Kerkorian pass with
three defenders clawing at him, it
was Eric Southwood fancy-stepping
off-tackle for 15 yards. When it
wasn't Southwood, it was Boh Ma
thias, the world's greatest athlete,
galloping 28 yards around right end.
And when it wasn't Mathias it was
Harry Hugasian fighting, squirming
his way up the middle for 14, or Boh
Meyers, playing with a painful
shoulder pointer, kicking 45 yards to
the UCLA four. The strong blocking
was also important in the TEAM ef
fort.
Applying the pressure when
they had to, which was constantly,
the defence continued where the
offense left off. Chuck Taylor's
plan of attack was immediately to
rush Paul Cameron and make him
either run or throw the hall right
away. The result was that the
UCLA soph sensation was stilled
as he has never hcen stifled before.
He ran 20 times, only averaging
two yards a carry, and completed
only five out of IK passes, although
several were dropped.
But if one back had to be singled
out for Stanford, it would probably
he the 204 pound, six-foot-three, Ma
thias. The Tulare flash had Stan
ford's best average, gaining 49 yards
in seven attempts for a seven yard
average. He tallied Stanford's last
two touchdowns, not bad for some
one playing his first collegiate game
(discount the two kick-off returns
last week.)
Dr. and Mrs. Mathias were in the
stands, and they said that the only
time that they were prouder of their
son was when he won the Olympic
decathalon championship at the age
of 17.
The Cards, undefeated in four trips
from the barn, took the opening
kick-off to the 23, and Southwood
and the Hipster combined to move
the ball to the UCLA 43. Here was
where tackle Ed Miller recovered an
Indian fumble, and Stanford rooters
poignantly recalled the pattern in the
last two Bruin games when the West
wooders had taken advantage of such
breaks to win.
