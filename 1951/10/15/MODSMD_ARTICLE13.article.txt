# Team Effort Gets 4th Win
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
The Red Indian had to wait
three years to trounce UCLA, but
when he did it, he did it with
satisfying completeness, 21 to 7,
and no one can deny that there's
a faint aroma of roses on the
Farm this morning.
It was a TEAM victory all the way
through. When Bill McColl wasn't
accepting a Gary Kerkorian pass with
three defenders clawing at him, it
was Eric Southwood fancy-stepping
off-tackle for 15 yards. When it
wasn't Southwood, it was Boh Ma
thias, the world's greatest athlete,
galloping 28 yards around right end.
And when it wasn't Mathias it was
Harry Hugasian fighting, squirming
his way up the middle for 14, or Boh
Meyers, playing with a painful
shoulder pointer, kicking 45 yards to
the UCLA four. The strong blocking
was also important in the TEAM ef
fort.
Applying the pressure when
they had to, which was constantly,
the defence continued where the
offense left off. Chuck Taylor's
plan of attack was immediately to
rush Paul Cameron and make him
either run or throw the hall right
away. The result was that the
UCLA soph sensation was stilled
as he has never hcen stifled before.
He ran 20 times, only averaging
two yards a carry, and completed
only five out of IK passes, although
several were dropped.
But if one back had to be singled
out for Stanford, it would probably
he the 204 pound, six-foot-three, Ma
thias. The Tulare flash had Stan
ford's best average, gaining 49 yards
in seven attempts for a seven yard
average. He tallied Stanford's last
two touchdowns, not bad for some
one playing his first collegiate game
(discount the two kick-off returns
last week.)
Dr. and Mrs. Mathias were in the
stands, and they said that the only
time that they were prouder of their
son was when he won the Olympic
decathalon championship at the age
of 17.
The Cards, undefeated in four trips
from the barn, took the opening
kick-off to the 23, and Southwood
and the Hipster combined to move
the ball to the UCLA 43. Here was
where tackle Ed Miller recovered an
Indian fumble, and Stanford rooters
poignantly recalled the pattern in the
last two Bruin games when the West
wooders had taken advantage of such
breaks to win.
Nothing of the sort came to pass,
and 45 seconds into the second
quarter Stanford had a hig fat
seven on the scoreboard. It was
the result of a 46 yard drive which
