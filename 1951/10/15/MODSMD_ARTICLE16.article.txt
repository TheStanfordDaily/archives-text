HURRYIN' HARRY—Harry Hugasian (25) rips for yardage in
side a block by Bill McColl (3) in first quarter of Indians' 21-7
victory Saturday. Hugasian's slashing thrusts sparked Stan
ford's first touchdown drive and it was the Hipster who powered

over from one yard for the first six points. Gary Kerkorian (17)
looks on in background as Bruin center Peterson wheels in
pursuit of the flying Armenian.
