### PETE GROTHE 
AN EXPOSE ON ADVERTISING
The longest word in the English language is the
one that follows "And now a word from our sponsor."

Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to
Nathaniel Macon, once wrote,
"advertisements contain the only
truths to be relied on in a news
paper." And I am here to offer
that advertising has changed
quite a bit since Jefferson was
presidenting it up. For instance,
Tom never had a radio with a
built-in eyestrain, better known
as n TV set.
He didn't have to look at those

video bread advertisements which are designed to
induce people to run to the corner grocery and pick
up the designated brand of bread. Right now.
There is nothing less appetizing than seeing people
eat on the screen. They chomp lustily, roll their
eyes joyfully, and lick their chops. What is worse
i> when they show gooey, sloppy little kids eating
bread. This is enough to make one give up his dinner.
While on the subject of bread, here in the West, a
certain brand is supposed to be Hopalong Cassidy's
favorite. I went East this summer, and to my dismay,
another brand was advertised as the type that Hoppy
; Iways puts his butter on. All of which makes me be
lieve that things have considerably changed since Mr.
Jefferson said, "Advertisements contain the only
truths to be relied on in a newspaper."
Consider some more incongruities.
1 recently looked through a national weekly mag
azine, and on the center page was a milk company
advertisement. It depicted a hostess in a fashion
able living room entertaining her guest. The only
trouble was that her guest was a cow. Now what
do you say when you have a cow for a guest? Do
you say "A little more in the coffee, please" or
"S'll have another glassfull," or iust what? This is

an awkward situation, calling for striped pants ami
lonx coat-tails diplomacy.
Or how about the liniment advertisements? Here
is a gentleman who is mowing the lawn, and he is |
remarking, "Boy, I'm certainly looking forward to 1
that dance at the club tonight."
Suddenly, a little green man stabs him in the back
with a pitchfork. The gentleman's wife comes out !
and finds him moaning. "Don't worry," she coos, :
"Gentle, soothing such and such will cure muscular I
aches and pains."
Muscular aches and pains, pooh. Anybody with
two eyes can see that a little green man is stabbing
him in the hack with a pitchfork.
Then there's the Mr. Coffee Nerves ad. A husband
and wife are eating breakfast, and standing in the 1
background is Mr. Coffee Nerves with a villainous
grin. The husband is grumpy and is saying unnice
things to his spouse about the toast she happened to
burn.
Ilmmmfff. He should he complaining about burnt
toast when there's another man in the room.
As a matter of fact, the gentlemen who concoct the i
Cellar coffee have asked me to write their commercials I
for KZSU this year. And I shall be brutally honest. j
My commercial will go something like this, "Remem- {
ber, Cellar coffee has that new process: It is untouched |
by human hands, unseen by human eyes, and unfit
for human consumption."
Then I'll have a lady come out. and in a whining,
nasal voice she will say, "My husband used to toss
in his sleep at ni;;ht. Then one night I gave him
Cellar coffee. Now, he just lays there."
Someday the American institution of advertising :
will topple with a startling crash. And everyone will
be much the happier for it. Especially Mr. Jefferson, '
who is doing somersaults in his grave for ever having
written that letter to Nathaniel Macon.
Editor's note: Well, not EVERYONE. Pete.
