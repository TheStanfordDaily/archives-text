# JEBB, AUSTIN, AND N.Y. NIGHT LIFE
## Former Stanford Student Gives More Impressions of His Internship at UN 
### 
The following is the last installment of a letter
from former Stanford student Dave Exley, who was
an intern at UN headquarters in New York City Ibis
summer.
As internes, we were given good seats in the cham
ber. and it was fascinating to come almost face to
face with the statesmen who previously were merely
names in print to us—self-assured Sir Gladwyn Jebb,
with his penetrating sardonic wit; bulky and impres
sive Warren Austin.
Of course, the so-called villain of the piece, Mr.
Yakov Malik, was on vacation in the Soviet Union,
and his deputy. Mr. Semyon Tsarapkin, distinguished
himself by speaking briefly only once in the whole de
bate and then threatening to use the veto.
Apart from visits to the Security Council and com
mittee sessions, our student group heard a series of
hourly lectures every day from UN officials ranging
from assistant secretary-general to section chief,
'these lectures probably did more than anything
else to straighten out our ideas about the UN and to
become better acquainted with its organization.
For instance, we no longer looked completely mysti
fied when someone referred mysteriously to the SO.
to UNKURK, UNICEF, UNSCOB or the TAB. (The
Daily is offering a prize for the first correct inter
pretation as a test of IQ).
The SG, incidentally, has his offices on the 38th
floor, which is also the only one with wall-to-wall
carpet.
The idea is that you start in on the first floor at the
UN and move up one floor successively with each
promotion until becoming Secretary-General with
vail-to-wall carpet.
Nevertheless, these lectures were more than mere
codes to abbreviations. Two of the most impressive
■peakers were Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dr. Ralph
J. Bunche, head of the Trusteeship Department, and
the Assistant Secretary General for Public Informa
tion, Mr. Benjamin Cohen.
Social activities consumed quite a large portion
of our time. Once you recover from the initial shock
of New York's depressing heat, dirt and row. the
nijjht life possibilities here have to be seen to be
believed—even after San Francisco! The must-see
attractions seem endless, and the pace is really fast.
We were entertained by several individuals and
groups specially interested in UN affairs.
For instance, one Sunday, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
invited us to be her guests at Valkure "Cottage," not

far from Hyde Park. We hud lunch on the lawn there,
and Mrs. Roosevelt came and sat down on the grass
to talk to us about the United Nations Covenant on
Human Rights. Then, she hustled us off to Hyde Park,
where we visited the library and home of the late
president.
In between all these hectic activities, we found time
to work at our respective assignments at the UN.
Each of us was assigned to different departments
throughout the Secretariat according to our back
ground and preference, and given work in line with
our experience. In this way, we assimilated some of
the atmosphere of the UN, and learned the attractions
and disappointments of such a job.
For instance, all we three Stanford students were
assigned to the Department of Public Information—
Tom Bartlctt and I were in the Radio Division, Tom
on the production side and I was in the news room.
Karl Kisler was in the Press Division.
Tom produced several radio shows, two of which
featured UN internes and were broadcast in the UN's
overseas programs. Three of our groups appeared on
a New York television show.
My job was to help write 5, 10 and 15-minute radio
broadcasts which the UN beams out all over the world,
24 hours a day. through Voice of America. Canadian
and 8.8.C. facilities.
Tom Bartlett sailed for England on September 25
and is now at O'xford, while Karl Kisler returned to
Austria a few weeks earlier; I am still languishing for
California,
We ail made good friends in many parts of the world
in those eight weeks and were sorry to see the group
break up.
As a result of our stay here, the UN seems more
real and meaningful to us than it ever did before;
wi 112 were impressed by the earnest sincerity and en
ergy of those who are seeking to make the idea a
success.
Hope burns brightly in the UN Secretariat; il will
not be their fault, if the organization fails in its
purpose.
And even if it does not succeed . . . even if there
is subsequently another UN. and another and still
another . . . but if, finally, the nations do work out
an effective way of outlawing aggression and guar
anteeing peace and prosperity, then, personally, I be
lieve that all our present and past strivings for an
effective world organization are well worth the enor
mous cost, time and effort. For half-a-loaf is still
better than no bread.

and is now at O'xford, while Karl Kisler returned to
Austria a few weeks earlier; I am still languishing for
California,
We ail made good friends in many parts of the world
in those eight weeks and were sorry to see the group
break up.
As a result of our stay here, the UN seems more
real and meaningful to us than it ever did before;
wi 112 were impressed by the earnest sincerity and en
ergy of those who are seeking to make the idea a
success.
Hope burns brightly in the UN Secretariat; il will
not be their fault, if the organization fails in its
purpose.
And even if it does not succeed . . . even if there
is subsequently another UN. and another and still
another . . . but if, finally, the nations do work out
an effective way of outlawing aggression and guar
anteeing peace and prosperity, then, personally, I be
lieve that all our present and past strivings for an
effective world organization are well worth the enor
mous cost, time and effort. For half-a-loaf is still
better than no bread.
The following is the last installment of a letter
from former Stanford student Dave Exley, who was
an intern at UN headquarters in New York City Ibis
summer.
As internes, we were given good seats in the cham
ber. and it was fascinating to come almost face to
face with the statesmen who previously were merely
names in print to us—self-assured Sir Gladwyn Jebb,
with his penetrating sardonic wit; bulky and impres
sive Warren Austin.
Of course, the so-called villain of the piece, Mr.
Yakov Malik, was on vacation in the Soviet Union,
and his deputy. Mr. Semyon Tsarapkin, distinguished
himself by speaking briefly only once in the whole de
bate and then threatening to use the veto.
Apart from visits to the Security Council and com
mittee sessions, our student group heard a series of
hourly lectures every day from UN officials ranging
from assistant secretary-general to section chief,
'these lectures probably did more than anything
else to straighten out our ideas about the UN and to
become better acquainted with its organization.
For instance, we no longer looked completely mysti
fied when someone referred mysteriously to the SO.
to UNKURK, UNICEF, UNSCOB or the TAB. (The
Daily is offering a prize for the first correct inter
pretation as a test of IQ).
The SG, incidentally, has his offices on the 38th
floor, which is also the only one with wall-to-wall
carpet.
The idea is that you start in on the first floor at the
UN and move up one floor successively with each
promotion until becoming Secretary-General with
vail-to-wall carpet.
Nevertheless, these lectures were more than mere
codes to abbreviations. Two of the most impressive
■peakers were Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dr. Ralph
J. Bunche, head of the Trusteeship Department, and
the Assistant Secretary General for Public Informa
tion, Mr. Benjamin Cohen.
Social activities consumed quite a large portion
of our time. Once you recover from the initial shock
of New York's depressing heat, dirt and row. the
nijjht life possibilities here have to be seen to be
believed—even after San Francisco! The must-see
attractions seem endless, and the pace is really fast.
We were entertained by several individuals and
groups specially interested in UN affairs.
For instance, one Sunday, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
invited us to be her guests at Valkure "Cottage," not

far from Hyde Park. We hud lunch on the lawn there,
and Mrs. Roosevelt came and sat down on the grass
to talk to us about the United Nations Covenant on
Human Rights. Then, she hustled us off to Hyde Park,
where we visited the library and home of the late
president.
In between all these hectic activities, we found time
to work at our respective assignments at the UN.
Each of us was assigned to different departments
throughout the Secretariat according to our back
ground and preference, and given work in line with
our experience. In this way, we assimilated some of
the atmosphere of the UN, and learned the attractions
and disappointments of such a job.
For instance, all we three Stanford students were
assigned to the Department of Public Information—
Tom Bartlctt and I were in the Radio Division, Tom
on the production side and I was in the news room.
Karl Kisler was in the Press Division.
Tom produced several radio shows, two of which
featured UN internes and were broadcast in the UN's
overseas programs. Three of our groups appeared on
a New York television show.
My job was to help write 5, 10 and 15-minute radio
broadcasts which the UN beams out all over the world,
24 hours a day. through Voice of America. Canadian
and 8.8.C. facilities.

to work at our respective assignments at the UN.
Each of us was assigned to different departments
throughout the Secretariat according to our back
ground and preference, and given work in line with
our experience. In this way, we assimilated some of
the atmosphere of the UN, and learned the attractions
and disappointments of such a job.
For instance, all we three Stanford students were
assigned to the Department of Public Information—
Tom Bartlctt and I were in the Radio Division, Tom
on the production side and I was in the news room.
Karl Kisler was in the Press Division.
Tom produced several radio shows, two of which
featured UN internes and were broadcast in the UN's
overseas programs. Three of our groups appeared on
a New York television show.
My job was to help write 5, 10 and 15-minute radio
broadcasts which the UN beams out all over the world,
24 hours a day. through Voice of America. Canadian
and 8.8.C. facilities.
Tom Bartlett sailed for England on September 25
and is now at O'xford, while Karl Kisler returned to
Austria a few weeks earlier; I am still languishing for
California,
We ail made good friends in many parts of the world
in those eight weeks and were sorry to see the group
break up.
As a result of our stay here, the UN seems more
real and meaningful to us than it ever did before;
wi 112 were impressed by the earnest sincerity and en
ergy of those who are seeking to make the idea a
success.
Hope burns brightly in the UN Secretariat; il will
not be their fault, if the organization fails in its
purpose.
And even if it does not succeed . . . even if there
is subsequently another UN. and another and still
another . . . but if, finally, the nations do work out
an effective way of outlawing aggression and guar
anteeing peace and prosperity, then, personally, I be
lieve that all our present and past strivings for an
effective world organization are well worth the enor
mous cost, time and effort. For half-a-loaf is still
better than no bread.
The following is the last installment of a letter
from former Stanford student Dave Exley, who was
an intern at UN headquarters in New York City Ibis
summer.
As internes, we were given good seats in the cham
ber. and it was fascinating to come almost face to
face with the statesmen who previously were merely
names in print to us—self-assured Sir Gladwyn Jebb,
with his penetrating sardonic wit; bulky and impres
sive Warren Austin.
Of course, the so-called villain of the piece, Mr.
Yakov Malik, was on vacation in the Soviet Union,
and his deputy. Mr. Semyon Tsarapkin, distinguished
himself by speaking briefly only once in the whole de
bate and then threatening to use the veto.
Apart from visits to the Security Council and com
mittee sessions, our student group heard a series of
hourly lectures every day from UN officials ranging
from assistant secretary-general to section chief,
'these lectures probably did more than anything
else to straighten out our ideas about the UN and to
become better acquainted with its organization.
For instance, we no longer looked completely mysti
fied when someone referred mysteriously to the SO.
to UNKURK, UNICEF, UNSCOB or the TAB. (The
Daily is offering a prize for the first correct inter
pretation as a test of IQ).
The SG, incidentally, has his offices on the 38th
floor, which is also the only one with wall-to-wall
carpet.
The idea is that you start in on the first floor at the
UN and move up one floor successively with each
promotion until becoming Secretary-General with
vail-to-wall carpet.
Nevertheless, these lectures were more than mere
codes to abbreviations. Two of the most impressive
■peakers were Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dr. Ralph
J. Bunche, head of the Trusteeship Department, and
the Assistant Secretary General for Public Informa
tion, Mr. Benjamin Cohen.
Social activities consumed quite a large portion
of our time. Once you recover from the initial shock
of New York's depressing heat, dirt and row. the
nijjht life possibilities here have to be seen to be
believed—even after San Francisco! The must-see
attractions seem endless, and the pace is really fast.
We were entertained by several individuals and
groups specially interested in UN affairs.
For instance, one Sunday, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
invited us to be her guests at Valkure "Cottage," not

far from Hyde Park. We hud lunch on the lawn there,
and Mrs. Roosevelt came and sat down on the grass
to talk to us about the United Nations Covenant on
Human Rights. Then, she hustled us off to Hyde Park,
where we visited the library and home of the late
president.
