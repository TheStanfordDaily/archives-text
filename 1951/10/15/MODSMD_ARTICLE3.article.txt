TOKYO, Monday, Oct. 15â€”Allied
infantrymen captured five impor- j
tant hills below the Chinese head
quarters base of Kumsong without
firing a shot today as Chinese sud
denly retreated, leaving behind j
equipment and ammunition.
Today's gains brought to eight |
miles the total gain since the Allied |
offensive jumped off three days ago
heavily supported by tanks and ar- j
tilledy. Th&y have now captured a
total of 17 vital peaks on the api
proaches to the central Korean Red j
base.
An Allied briefing officer said two !
of the five hills taken this morning j
were "very important" and that the :
Chinese failed to defend them de- j
spite the fact that three Allied divi
sions were driving their offensive j
closer to the big Communist supply I
center.
