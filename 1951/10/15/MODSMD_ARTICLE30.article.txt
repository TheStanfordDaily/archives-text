To the Editor:
Since proper organization of a college rooting sec
lion demands that it b>.» led by a head-cheerleader,
and since the size of the Stanford stadium makes it
necessary that the person in this position be equipped
with a microphone, we feel it necessary to make this
(umplaint.
His continuous well-amplified but not too well in
formed editorial comment upon the game in progress
constitutes a definite detriment to the enjoyment of
a football afternoon.
We feel that it is his duty to lead cheers in a partisan
but sportsmanlike manner. The play-by-play pre
dictions are extraneous and annoying; moreover, when
we «re told to be quiet while the Stanford players are
trying to hear the signals but to yemmer our loudest
to prevent an opposing team from enjoying the same*
necessary privilege, or when we are informed that an
opponent is "chicken' - because our mike expert
doesn't think it is planning to run at fourth down in
midfield- when thes" comments ore blasted into our
e. rs, the annoyanc* becomes a deep-seated irritation.
We therefore suggest that the Stanford head-cheer-

leadcr confine his use of the microphone to the mini
mum necessary to direct the cheers of the Stanford
section.

To the Editor:
I have been attending football g:ime movies for a
number of years. In the past I have been very amiable
towards imperfections in presentation.
Last Wednesday, however, the film was greatly
speeded up. In fact, it was practically impossible t;>
follow the plays. Since I had gone to the show with
the intention of seeing Bill McColl catch passes, I wns
very disappointed.
I would like to request that in the future thev.« foot
ball game films be run at a more reasonable clip
ljet s not see an hour of lootb.ill in twenty minutes.
