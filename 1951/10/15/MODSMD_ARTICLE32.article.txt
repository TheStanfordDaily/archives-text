lean Renoir's "The River,"
now playing at the Stage Dcor
in San Francisco, brings a dif
ferent and unusual treatment of
[ndia to the screen.
Working with technicolor in the |
real - life setting of West Bengal.
India, along the banks of the Gan
ges River (where the story of the J
original Rumer Godden novel was
laid), photographers were able to
; capture some of the pageantry of '
! Indian river life.
Accompanied by a musical score :
recorded in India, full of Oriental <

flavor, there are
several dynamic
shots which re
veal the most
picturesque and
glamorous parts
of Indian cul
ture.

There are scenes of the Diwali !
! festival, when millions of lights
burn all over India, each light sym
bolic of a life given in a great war;
I the Kali Pujua ceremony, with its
! traditional worship of the great
Goddess of Destruction and Crea
tion; the "Holi Day" festival, when
Hindus celebrate the arrival of
spring by throwing colored powders
on each other, symbolic of the
temptation of man.
There are realistic yet somewhat
glamorized shots of boatmen at |
j work on the river and a scene of the |
bazaar filled with a variety of shops I
and several of the teeming millions I
who inhabit India.
But these notable effects serve but
as a background to the main story. I
which has little correlation with j
j India, its people, or life on the river, j
; The potential of the picture which
lies in its setting seems to have been j
overlooked. The intermittent shots
of life along the Ganges, although j
the best part of the 2 1 /2-hour pro
duction, seem more like a pageant i
filmed in Hollywood than in the
natural setting of India.
The ?;tory concerns an English
family who live along the banks of |
the river. The father, foreman of
i the jute press, principal industry
of the village, is played by Esmond
Knight and the mother by Nora
Swinburne, both outstanding Eng- i
lish stars.
Family of Six
They have a family of six. all girls
except for Bogey (Richard Foster).
The eldest is 14-year-old Harriet
(Patricia Walters), whose "growing
pains" constitute the main element
in the plot.
Patricia Walters in her first
screen performance does u good job
j ol portraying a sensitive young girl

discovering some of the aspects of
life — first love and tragedy. The
story is narrated by Harriet, and it
is her impressions of "The River"
and life around it which are
brought to the screen.
Along with Harriet, her two
friends—Valerie (Adrienne Cori). a
coquettish young lady of 18, and
Melanie (Radha), daughter of an
English neighbor and an Indian
mother — make their mark on a
stranger to the river, Captain John
(Thomas E. Breen), a young man
from America who has lost a leg in
the war.
Girls in Love

Captain John, and the young man.
