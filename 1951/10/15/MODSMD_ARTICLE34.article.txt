has benefited from the projects of

more than 300 hours last year on
those and similar projects for the
student body and faculty, the com

Now Growing
Currently in a period of growth
and expansion, the Stanford chap
ter of A Phi O is working on plans
for "bigger and better" projects,
not the least of which is the Stu
dent Book Exchange, due to open
next quarter. This project is one
which is typical of A Phi O serv
ice — a non-profit project designed
to assist students in buying and sell
ing used books more easily and
economically.

Alpha Phi Omega will hold an
open meeting for interested stu
dents tomorrow night at 7:30 in
Room 7N, Education Building.
University Director of Informa- ;
tion Fred Glover will speak.

Revived in 1946 after a period of
inactivity during the war, the Zeta !
chapter of A Phi O here at Stanford
has paralleled a nation-wide growth
in the fraternity. Alpha Phi Omega,
the only national organization of its i
kind, celebrated its silver anniver
sary last year with 255 active chap
ters. Only Phi Beta Kappa can
claim a greater following .
According to Bill Sanson, current
Farm chapter president, A Phi O '
activities at Stanford fall into three
basic categories — service to the j
campus, the community, and to the '
scouting movement.
Project Examples
The quarterly commuters' file and

the vacation rides - home box fall
into the first category. The Crusade
for Freedom campaign and the
making ol organizational charts for
civilian defense are included in the
community service.
The current "University of Scout
ing" and sponsorship of the Con
valescent Home scout troop are the
fraternity's contribution to the
scouting movement.
"In addition to the more than 20
projects carried on last year," ex
plains current projects vice-presi
dent Lucien Faust, "a good number
of the members are active as lead
ers in local scout troops."
A Phi O members do not, how
ever, follow the policy of al! work
and no play. As Sanson explained,
social events and athletic contests
are held regularly with the other
five Bay Area chapters of the fra
ternity.
