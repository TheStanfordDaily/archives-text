## 
### 
Stanfords undefeated water-polo team bruised to a seven to six
win over a good UCLA squad last Saturday in the local pool.
The rough game was marred by a constant stream of arguments
and fouls. Eight men fouled out and the referee took two apparen:
goals from each side because of various infractions of the rules

Each of these decisions was followed
by a heated discussion.
The Card's chances looked bleak
when in the third p3iiod, with the
icore reading four to lour, Stanford's
high-scoring ace Bob Frojen fouled
out. Frojen had scored three of the
goals.
Gaughram Takes Over
However soph Jim Gaughram took
over the reigns of the attack and
plunked in two fourth quarter goals
to give Stanford the game.
The win was a big one for Stanford
since UCLA and Stanford were co

favorites to take the PCC. Stanforc
will meet the Bruins again in Los-
Angeles.

praised the play of Frojen and
Gaughram. He also had kind words
for Ash Jones and Mel Butler, Stan

the other one.
