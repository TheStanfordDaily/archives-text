TOKYO —Allied and Communist
liaison officers held their fifth meet- [
ing in the Panmunjon "circus tent" j
today, with prospects considerably 1
brighter for early resumption of ;
armistice negotiations.
Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway's frank
admission yesterday that. Allied air- j
men shot up the Kaesong-Panmun- J
jon truce area Friday was believed {
to have paid the Communists' latest
price for calling full - dress truce |
talks as early as possible.
Only one thorny problem still j
faced the liaison officers as thev :
met to work out a set of ground ,
rules to cover the prospective meet- I
ings—the size of the truce zone. It j
was believed this could soon be set
tled.
