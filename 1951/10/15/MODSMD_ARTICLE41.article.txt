'"I he kids wanted to win and
1 they played a heck of a good ball
game."—Chuck Taylor.
"They unquestionably deserved to
j win."—Red Sanders.
These statements in brief summed
up the views of the two head
coaches after Stanford's 21 to 7
romp over UCLA Saturday.
Taylor opened. up with his boy
i ish grin to reporters in the dressing
room after the game and said, "I
don't know how they do it, but
these kids get themselves in a hole,
: keep their poise, and come out of it
heads' up." He was referring to
| quarterback Gary Kerkorian's per
fect third down pass from the 12-
] yard line in the third quarter and
Ail - American Bill McColl's spec
tacular catch on the 35 with four
defenders hanging onto him.

Taylor went the limit in praising
j the Cards and lauded halfbacks Ron
Cook and Eric Southwood, as well
as Kerkorian and McColl. About
I Bob Mathias, Chuck conservatively
I said, "He showed he could play
ball."
He also had a word for fullback
Vies Laubscher, who came in late
in the game, and indicated that with
four acceptable fullbaks in Bob
Meyers, Skip Crist, Mathias, and
j Laubscher, there might be some
j shifting in the near future to make
use of his talents.

Chuck also was undoubtedly
proud of the defensive unit as he
said. "They broke In spots, but held
in the crucial moments. They really
played their hearts out."
The Card mentor didn't let down
when the conversation rolled
around to the Bruins. He tabbed
them as opportunists and said they
are "an explosive ball club. They

Referring to Paul Cameron, UC
LA's soph whiz, who didn't get

commented that Stanford's game
was to rush him off his feet, weak-

line in an attempt to stop Cameron
from throwing. Chuck grinned once
again as he said the Cards did just
that.
Best Stanford Team
UCLA's Coach Red Sanders in
the Bruin dressing room sadly
agreed that Stanford "played a
whale of a ball game." He said,
"It's the best all-around Stanford
team I've ever seen."
Sanders wasn't grinning like
Chuck when he spoke of his down
trodden Uclans. "They're the only
team in the country," complained
Sanders, spaking of his defensive
team, "with a 157-pound guard." He
added that Donn ?vloomaw. the
Bruins' prospective All - American
linebacker, didn't help much be
cause of injuries.
Praise for Keyes
The Bruin coach had a lot of
praise for fullback Luther Keyes,
while saying that end Ernie Stock
ert, UCLA's answer to McColl,
played a bad game. Stockert, along
with left end Pete O'Garro, was
dropping passes that he should have
had with ease, passes that conceiv
ably could have changed the entire
game.

Best Stanford Team
UCLA's Coach Red Sanders in
the Bruin dressing room sadly
agreed that Stanford "played a
whale of a ball game." He said,
"It's the best all-around Stanford
team I've ever seen."
Sanders wasn't grinning like
Chuck when he spoke of his down
trodden Uclans. "They're the only
team in the country," complained
Sanders, spaking of his defensive
team, "with a 157-pound guard." He
added that Donn ?vloomaw. the
Bruins' prospective All - American
linebacker, didn't help much be
cause of injuries.
Praise for Keyes
The Bruin coach had a lot of
praise for fullback Luther Keyes,
while saying that end Ernie Stock
ert, UCLA's answer to McColl,
played a bad game. Stockert, along
with left end Pete O'Garro, was
dropping passes that he should have
had with ease, passes that conceiv
ably could have changed the entire
game.
'"I he kids wanted to win and
1 they played a heck of a good ball
game."—Chuck Taylor.
"They unquestionably deserved to
j win."—Red Sanders.
These statements in brief summed
up the views of the two head
coaches after Stanford's 21 to 7
romp over UCLA Saturday.
Taylor opened. up with his boy
i ish grin to reporters in the dressing
room after the game and said, "I
don't know how they do it, but
these kids get themselves in a hole,
: keep their poise, and come out of it
heads' up." He was referring to
| quarterback Gary Kerkorian's per
fect third down pass from the 12-

Ail - American Bill McColl's spec
tacular catch on the 35 with four
defenders hanging onto him.
