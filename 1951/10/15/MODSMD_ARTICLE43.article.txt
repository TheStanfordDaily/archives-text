# Pigskin Poll
## 
### 
Psychology edged out the meth
-5 ods of law by the narrowest of
| margins to open up a tiny lead, 81
per cent right to 80 per cent, for
the professors' team, as the Peer
less Pigskin Pickers' Poll rolled
through its second weekend.
Both Donald W. Taylor of the
| Psych Department and Dean Carl
j Spaeth of the Law School rated
| Master Pickers' awards as their se
j lections ran 100 per cent true, eight
| games out of eight.
Cah'in P. Stone of the psych pro
fessors and Neal McCrory of the
Law School tied for second place
with seven wins and one loss.
Bringing up the rear were psychol
ogy prof C. L. Winder and law stu
i dents Don Beradelli and R. W.
| Knowlton, who missed two games
I each.
