LONDON, Oct. llâ€”Great Britain
has agreed to turn over its giant
Suez Canal base to Egypt on condi
tion that it become an Allied base
for Middle East defense, the For
eign Office announced tonight.
Cairo dispatches predicted that
Egypt would reject the Western
proposal and go ahead with plans to
abrogate its 1936 treaty with Britain
on Suez and the 1899 agreement on
the Sudan, and demand that British
troops evacuate the two areas.
