# CARDS REVENGED, TOP BRUINS, 21-7
## Roble-Encina Cable Car Takes Sweepstakes Award 
### 
Roble-Encina's clanging Cable Car aimed at destroying a pros
trate Bruin took the sweepstakes award in Friday night's pre-
UCLA game float parade.
"Injun Belle Lures Bruin to Hell"—a seductive maiden coaxing
a UCLA football stalwart in Hades—won the theme trophy for

Guthrie-Alpha Tau Omega. Judged
most humorous was "Injun Brave
Dies Bruin Grave," the Russell-Delta
Tau Delta entry.
A Cardinal footballer booting a
winged Bruin over a goalpost was the
mixed division award winner of La
throp-Alpha Sigma Phi. Phi Sigma
Kappa took the execution trophy for
a cannon shooting a Bruin into the
underworld, (see picture, page 4.)
The originality awards went to
Branner - Chi Psi for a big yellow
bear looking apprehensively at an
Indian rolling dice. Companion
themes were "Injun Eleven Send.s
Bruin to Heaven" and "Pair-a-dice
Lost."
Into Mausoleum
An Indian stuffing a Bruin into a
mausoleum was Theta Chi's prize
winning entry in the men's division.
(See picture, page 4.) No women's
division award was made because of
lack of competition.
Uclans and Stanfordites lined the
Serra Street parade route and even
perched on the roofs along the front
of Quad to view the 20-float lineup.
The parking area outside Memorial
Court was jammed for the rally,
which followed the parade.
Persons introduced at the two
events included Parade Grand Mar
shall Dink Templeton, UCLA student
body president Jim Davis, and ASSU
president Wayne Alley. George
Denny emceed the parade.
Judges Grateful
Judges were Miss Pat Davidson,
director of Stern Hall; Prof. Edward
Farmer of the Art Department; Fred
Glover, director of information, and
Dr. Rixford Snyder, director of ad
missions. Roy Alexander, UCLA
weekend chairman, reported that the
judges were gratified by the "splen
did show of entries" and thanked the
living groups for their efforts.
Both the UCLA and Stanford bands
played in the procession. Their ap
pearance was arranged by Jack But
ler.
As float after float went by show
ing Indians vanquishing hiq blown
bears, one tiny bystander asked,
"What's a Bruin, Daddy? Is that a
bad man?"


SWEEPSTAKES WINNER—RobIe-Encina carried off honors in
Friday night's float parade for their big bell-clanging "Cardinal
Railroad" Cable Car. Encouraged by an Indian maiden, the
Indian driver was aiming his vehicle at a Bruin tied to the rails
