## Egypt Cancels Treaty, Rejects Defense Pact 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt, Oct. 15 (UP)â€”Both houses of Egypt's parlia- j
ment voted unanimously tonight in favor of cancelling the Anglo-
Egyptian treaty of Suez and the 1899 Sudan agreement, and the
government bluntly rejected an American-backed plan to bring
Egypt into a mid-Eastern defense pact.
King Farouk was expected to sign the two measures which

would oust British troops from the
strategic Suez Canal and the Nile
Valley later tonight. The bills will
become law when published in the
official gazette, probably tomorrow.
Parliament also approved another
measure calling for a constitutional
amendment annexing the Sudan to
Egypt and proclaiming Farouk
"King of Egypt and the Sudan."
Tiie latter measure is expected to
light the fuse to an explosive situ
ation in the Sudan where the union
ist party is supporting a merger
with Egypt while a separatist party
wants Sudanese independence.
