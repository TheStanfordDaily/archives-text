# Firm Leases Campus Land
## Electronic Co. Gets 10 Acres 
### 
Vrrian Associates, an electronics
manufacturing and research firm of
San Carlos, signed a 99-year lease
on approximately 10 acres of Stan
ford property, it was announced
yesterday by President J. Wallace
Sterling and Eussel H. Varian, pres
ident ofÂ»the electronics firm.
The Varian company is expected
to start construction of a million
dollar plant on lot 41, located just
west of El Camino Real and south
of Page Mill Road, early next year.
Completion is scheduled within a
year of the starting date.
The lease also includes provision
for a one-year option on six addi
tional acres.
The 10 acres are part of 50 set
aside h.v the University for im
mediate industrial development.
Granting the lease is part of
Stanford's long-range program to
develop its outlying properties in
accord with the interests of the
Palo Alto area. University Busi
ness Manager Alf Rrandin pointed
out. He described Varian Asso
ciates as "clean, quiet, and
smokeless."
The firm will operate its San Car
los plant simultaneously with the
campus branch. It will devote the
San Carlos plant entirely to manu
facturing and plans a 70 per cent
expansion there.
The klystron tube, presently the
chief product of the firm, was in
vented at Stanford by Russell Var
ian and Sigurd Varian, both re
search associates at Stanford, and
the late Dr. William W. Hansen,
professor of physics.
The firm produces more than
12 models of klystron tubes. All
operate in the ultra - high - fre
quency range of radio microwaves
which can he directed into nar
row beams somewhat in the man
ner of a searchlight. Varian kly
strons serve as oscillators, ampli
fiers, modulators, demodulators,
and multipliers.
They range from under three
inches to more than four feet in
length. They are extensively used
in radar and other military devices,
in aircraft blind landing guides, and
in many communications systems
such as the microwave link relay.
Stanford faculty members on the
Varian Associates board of direc
tors include Dr. Frederick E. Ter
man, dean of the School of Engi
neering: Dr. Leonard I. SchifT, head
of the Physics Department; and Dr.
Edward L. Gin/.ton, director of the
Microwave Laboratory.
Four members of the Stanford
faculty are affiliated with Varian .
Associates as scientific consult
ants .They are Dr. Felix Bloch,
Dr. Marvin Cbodorow, and Dr.
Edwin T. Javncs of the Physics
Department, and Dr. Lester M.
Field of the Flcctrical Fnginccr
ing Department.
The University will provide roads

and utilities toward development of
the 50-acrc area, according to Bran
din. Other leases for further devel
opment are still pending, he said.
