# NEW MAGAZINE PLANNED

Another attempt to start a Stanford literary magazine to follow in
the tradition of the famous Sequoia is in the offing.
Six Stanford undergraduates arc busy right now gathering material
for the new magazine, as yet unnamed. They hope to publish the first
issue sometime this quarter.
According to Bud McCord, spokesman for the group, the new literary
magazine will feature short stories, editorials, articles on controversial
subjects, and poetry. Book reviews may also be included.
Other students active in the venture are Mrs. Bud McCord, JoAnn
Tuttle, Pete Emmet, Hal Rogers and Tom Johnson. All are seniors ex
cept Johnson, a sophomore.
McCord said the first issue will be 48 pages. All printing will be black
and white, though ink sketches will be used. Present plans call for the
magazine to sell on campus for 30 cents. However, no definite price has
been set pending final printing arrangements.
Publications Committee has given its approval to the plan and McCord
told The Daily that the next move was to get University approval. The
backers are also on the lookout for a limited amount of financial aid.
McCord said the purpose of the new magazine would be two-fold.
"There are many serious minded persons on campus who will be interested
in this type of publication. Secondly, we want to give an opportunity to
persons interested in writing to get their work into print and thus criti
cized," he said.
Literary magazines at Stanford have led a stormy life. The first and
most famous literary book was The Sequoia, started in 1891. The Sequoia
lasted until 1919. Among its editors were Paul C. Edwards, San Fran
cisco newspaperman and President of the Board of Trustees, and Dr.
Edith Mirrielees, Professor of English emeritus here.
Another famous Stanford magazine was the Lit, constantly in trouble
because many readers objected to its slang title. Other magazines which
started with high hopes but folded due to financial difficulties include
the Cardinal, Pecsorial, Spectator, and Carillon.
Fred O. .Glover, director of information, sairl he could remember no
literary magazine published by students here within the past five years.
McCord said he had high hopes of the new magazine lasting on a
permanent basis. "There should be sustained campus interest behind
such an idea," he stated.
McCord said contributions to the new magazine would be welcome
from all Stanford students, graduate or undergraduate. Faculty mem
bers will be asked to contribute from time to time.
Editorial control of the magazine will r<\main in the hands of under
graduates under present plans.
