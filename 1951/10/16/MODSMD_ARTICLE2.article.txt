### 
WASHINGTON â€” A Senate sub
committee will vote tomorrow on
the hotly disputed nomination of
Ambassador Philip C. Jessup to be
a US. delegate to the United Na
tions, it was announced today.
The vote is expected to be close.
Two members of the five-man For
eign Relations subcommittee are re
ported ready to vote for approval
and two against.
The deciding vote then would be
in the hands of the fifth member,
Sen. H. Alexander Smith, R., N.J.,
who said today there is "no ques
tion" of Jessup's loyalty but added
he is a "symbol" of the Far Eastern
policy "that we have been opposing
for two years."
