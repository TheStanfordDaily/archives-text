### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 15 (UP) â€” The
staff of the University of Chicago
Maroon, campus weekly suspended
because of alleged Communist ac
tivities of its editor, today started
work on next Friday's edition.
Dean of Students Robert M. Stro
zier revoked the suspension last
Friday after the paper's staff an
nounced they would meet Wednes
day to elect a new editor.
Strozier fired Editor Alan D.
Kimmel Oct. 5 because of his al
leged participation in the Commu
nist world youth festival in East
Berlin last August. The dean aho
suspended publication of the paper.
Members of the staff protested
that "freedom of the press" had
been violated but agreed to elect a
new editor after the university's
student government appointed a
committee to investigate the mat
ter.
Kimmel, a graduate .student of
geography, had not enrolled for the
fall term and university authorities
said they assumed he was still in
Germany.
(Strozier had originally asked the
school's student government to pro
pose a new method of electing an
editor, but the students refused to
do this. By a 6-3 vote they adopted
a resolution scoring Strozier and
asking immediate reinstatement of
the Maroon and its editor.
(The administration objected not
only to Kimmel's alleged Commu
nistic leanings but also to the fact
that the staff had complete contml
of the Maroon, with no restraining
hand from the administration or the
student" body except on financial
matters.
(The Maroon .staff argued that the
Student Bill of Rights guaranteed
selection and removal of organiza
tion officers by the organization in
volved.)
