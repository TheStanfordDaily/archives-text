### 
FLUSHING, N.Y. â€” Premier Mo-;
hammed Mossadegh of Iran today j
urged the United Nations to dismiss j
Britain's charge that world peace j
may be threatened by Iran's cxpul- j
sion of British oil interests.
Mossadegh told a jam - packed I
session of the UN Security Council
that his country would stand firm in
refusing to heed any UN resolution
calling for new negotiations. Nego
tiations must be direct, he said, in
a thin but steady voice. They must j
deal only with compensation for the
seized company and with machinery i
for selling nationalized oil.
