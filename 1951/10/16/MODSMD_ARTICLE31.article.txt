# Fraternity With a Purpose
## 
### 
Alpha Phi Omega is a fraternity with a pur
pose. That purpose is service to the student
body and faculty, community and nation, scout
ing, and fellow members.
To say that Stanford's A Phi O chapter has
succeeded in its purpose would be the under
statement of the year. No one group has
v/orked so hard to actually do something about
little gripes and inconveniences fac
ing the student body.
Stanford's A Phi O group has about 30 mem
bers. Though the guarter is just underway, the
fraternity has already helped in such projects
as policing at rallies and sponsoring the Uni
versity of Scouting.
Better than words of praise, the A Phi O rec
ord speaks for itself. Look over this partial list
of projects completed during the school year

1950 -51

Save power campaign; rides to Village sign
repaired and maintained; off campus com
muters' file established; vacation rides-home
box maintained at end of each guarter in library
lobby; parking survey carried out; card index
file of student body set up; civilian defense pro
gram aided; Freedom Scroll campaign carried
out at reguest of Excom; generous aid given to
Con Home Week and UN Model Assembly by
fraternity; Con Home scout troop set up.
The list is longer. Many additional projects
have been planned for this year. For instance, 1
A Phi O hopes to set up a book exchange for
second hand books next guarter.
To sum up a fine Stanford story, A Phi O is a
group which makes a big thing of helping the
University in little ways.
