# What Happened to That Test?
## 
### 
You have no doubt heard about the files of
past examinations in the Reserve Book Room.
You have probably looked up some of these
exams to your advantage. But every once in a
while you'll come across a manilla folder with
the exam torn out, or no manilla folder at all.
These files are kept in the Reserve Book Room
for the benefit of all students. They are meant
to be looked at in the RBR, not removed nor
defaced.
Sometimes looking up an old exam might
give you a hint on what your professor has in
store. It helps to know what type of question

is usually asked and how much material is
covered in this mid-quarter or final as the case
may be.
When someone makes off with one of these
filed exams it is to the disadvantage of his
present classmates, future students in the
course, and to the purpose of the entire system.
The exams are on file for all of us. If you
really want to memorize an old exam (which
probably won't do you much good the next
day) why don't you jot down the questions, re
turn the exam to its proper place, and give
everybody a break?—S.G.
