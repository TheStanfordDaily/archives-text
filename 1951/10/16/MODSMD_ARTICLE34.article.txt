## Let's Take Them One at a Time

To the Editor:
ll is safe to say that the asking price of Mr. Earl
Odell's Rose Bowl Tie went up on the basis of last
Saturday's excellent game against UCLA, but let us
not judge the failure or success of the entire season
by whether he has an opportunity to wear one par
ticular tie on one particular day in Pasadena.
The preseason speculation in 11)48, '49. and '50 put
Stanford at the top of the list for the Rose Bowl. We
enjoyed moderate success in all of these years, even
entering the play-off for Roses with Cal in 1940. but
the seasons were made to look dismal to some by the
fact that the team did not go to the Rose Bowl.
This year, with a new and THEN untried coach.
Stanford was placed in the "possibly going to Pasa
dena" group, and this took off the pressure. The team
was enabled to face each game separately, to con
centrate on the conduct of that game.
Stanford is engaged in competition with schools that
are much larger and much more willing to give finan
cial inducements to players. It is a physical impossi
bility for us to win the PCC championship every year,
and it is now legally impossible to go to the Rose
Bowl every year.
Therefore, it would be well to regard the victory
over UCLA as a triumph in itself—one which gave

Stanford rooters the first opportunity in 5 years to
serenade a major rooting section on the other side of
Stanford Stadium. Let us not be guilty of mimicking
the hare which forgot the importance of each in
dividual step, thought only of the final victory, and
went to sleep at the half way point, letting the Tortoise
slip by to win.

Last week when Cardinals found themselves in a
jam, with no living quarters for eighteen women
members of the UCLA Band, it was the Off-Campus
women who helped them out.
Many, many thanks to all of them for their gen
erous cooperation in supporting our program of wel
come, and in making the UCLA weekend a success.
It is indicative of their strong Stanford spirit that at
the last minute they so graciously opened their homes
and came to our rescue.

the seasons were made to look dismal to some by the
fact that the team did not go to the Rose Bowl.
This year, with a new and THEN untried coach.
Stanford was placed in the "possibly going to Pasa
dena" group, and this took off the pressure. The team
was enabled to face each game separately, to con
centrate on the conduct of that game.
Stanford is engaged in competition with schools that
are much larger and much more willing to give finan
cial inducements to players. It is a physical impossi
bility for us to win the PCC championship every year,
and it is now legally impossible to go to the Rose
Bowl every year.
Therefore, it would be well to regard the victory
over UCLA as a triumph in itself—one which gave

Stanford rooters the first opportunity in 5 years to
serenade a major rooting section on the other side of
Stanford Stadium. Let us not be guilty of mimicking
the hare which forgot the importance of each in
dividual step, thought only of the final victory, and
went to sleep at the half way point, letting the Tortoise
slip by to win.

Oil'-Campus Women Help
To the Editor:
Last week when Cardinals found themselves in a
jam, with no living quarters for eighteen women
members of the UCLA Band, it was the Off-Campus
women who helped them out.
Many, many thanks to all of them for their gen
erous cooperation in supporting our program of wel
come, and in making the UCLA weekend a success.
It is indicative of their strong Stanford spirit that at
the last minute they so graciously opened their homes
and came to our rescue.
Sincerely,
NANCY ERWIN
ASSU Vice-President
