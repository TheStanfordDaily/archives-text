### DICK McLEAN 
STANFORD IN THE SCIENCE FICTION EKA
Astro Zylch, Stanford student of the twenty-fifth
century, awoke to the sound of the synchro-amphly
dine computer as it clicked and hummed its "good
morning" on the chilly sleeping porch. The sun was
not due until 0613 and therefore the world was dark.
The sun rose every morning at the same time because
the old sun. proving inefficient.

was destroyed and replaced by a
man-made one manufactured by
Westinghouse. Astro was still a
bit sleepy and would have liked
to turn over for a few million
microseconds longer but he knew
the electronic alarm would record
the change in pulse and respira
tion. This was the twenty-fifth
century and no thinking man had
tried to beat a machine since the
last slot machine was destroyed.

1 lie lumpy health-bed shuddered once and then
began to rise putting Astro into a sitting position. He
figured that breakfast was coming and was correct lor
shortly a small tray arrived via the electric dumb
waiter system. On the platter sat the morning meal,
two toasted riboflaven vitamin tablets and a half jigger
of Hi. da col.
"But we had riboflavin yesterday," moaned Astro
as he popped the two crusty pills into his mouth and
swallowed them in a trickle of the high proof liquid.
"Rib-o-flav-en a-gain?" clicked a metallic voice
from the next bed. This was Mark, the exchange stu
dent from Mars. Mark always clicked his syllables
whs.-n he talked. Mark was a robot.
Astro was about to answer his friend when a lull
rang and (lie television set snapped on. Class was
beginning. The sleepy face of a professor emerged
on the screen. As he began to spo:ik. tin* automatic
note taker whirred into action as did the automatic
point summarize!*. Astro adiusted the electronic
knowledge infuser to his head. B\ this wonderful
method the facts were poured painlessly into the

subconscious.
After about four minutes of class the machines
ceased their activities. (The marvelous instruments
took down only the important things.)
Astro was troubled on this regulated morning in
the twenty-fifth century. He had been reading in an
ancient history book about the civilization of five
hundred years before. He had also seen a few ancient
motion pictures of the era.
"Mark, did vou know that in 1951 people had to
eat whole meals and set up in the morning and write
down their own notes?"
"Poor souls," Mark clicked, "they had to think for
themselves."
"And they used to be so tired at the end of the
week that some of them went out and drank beer."
"What is be-er?" clicked Mark inquisitively. (Beer
and all beverages of the kind were unknown in this
age.)
"I really don't know." answered Astro, "but some
authorities certainly made a fuss over it."
"And that's not all," Astro continued, "fellows
and girls used to have parties and dances and it
seems as if they had a good time."
"What is a girl?" clicked Mark again. (Girls too
were unknown in this era as science had discovered
them too great a distraction to mankind and therefore
outlawed them.)
"A girl is . . . Astro stammered. He tried to
remember from the pictures he had seen. "A girl is
. . . he tried again and failed in his attempt at
description as ail men of all ages have equally failed.
"I really don't know that either," he admitted, "but
some people certainly made a fuss over them."
"Life in the age of the twen-ti-eth een-tury must
not have been too un-pleasant," the robot said in his
precise fashion.
"Maybe not," Astro wondered as the professor on
television gave a po;i qui/ which the efficient re
corder, tabulated, answered, and scored. Maybe it
wasn't too bad at all."
