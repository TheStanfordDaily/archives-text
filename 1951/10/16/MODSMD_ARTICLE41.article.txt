i
The huckster, the master of bal
' lyhoo, and the walking ulcer will
all be campus personalities this year
I when Alpha Delta Sigma starts
Stanford's first advertising agency.
* ADS, professional ad fraternity, is
beginning a broad reorganization
1 and expansion program in order to
! make Stanford one of the few
schools in the country to have an
112 advertising agency staffed and man
aged by students.
ADS plans to handle local mer
j chants in the area anil create ad
vertising for the three Stanford me
dia—radio, newspaper, and maga
i zine. Plans have been made for
layout, art, copy, traffic, and pro
duction departments.
But men are needed to staff and
j manage these departments and ADS
! urges anyone having an interest in
1 advertising to attend the first gen
eral meeting tomorrow night.
ihe agency plans to work only
J two nights a month and during
i these nights to function similarly
ito a professional agency—planning
; campaigns, placing production or
j ders. drawing roughs, and exeeut
j ing the advertising process from
| rough to finished layout.
The fraternity feels that this type
'of advertising experience will be
j advantageous when a member seeks
| a job in advertising after gradua
i tion.
Other activities of the fraternity
j will include dinner meetings with
I talks and discussions by prominent
j advertising men in the Bay Area.
Everett Runyon, sales promotion
! manager of California Packing Cor
| poration, will speak at the opening
meeting tomorrow night in the
j Women's Clubhouse, lower lounge,
' at 7:30. All men are invited.
