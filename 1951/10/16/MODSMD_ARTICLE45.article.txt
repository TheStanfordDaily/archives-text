# PETE GROTHE
## Punts and Pitches Tuesday Morning Roundup 
### 
I*(JOT FOR CAL IHIS VVFI'.K. As you down your shredded wheat this
morning this is how the race for the roses shapes up. Stanford and USC
are undefeated; add Washington and Oregon State, and you have the four
contenders. Throw in Washington State and Cal (the Bears aren t eligible)
and you have two good spoilers.
Then be brave and take a look at Stanford's suicidal schedule. It con
tains all the above-mentioned, plus this week's "breather," Santa Clara. I
A Cal win this Saturday over USC would put Chuck Taylor's underlings
at the top of the heap, so forget what you think about the Bears for at
least one week and root for them against the Trojans. As it stands now, USC
is favored for the Pasadena classic, but the Huskies and OSC (with one loss
apiece) can't be counted out. Because with the fantastically tough PCC
competition this year, it's inconceivable that the Rose Bowl entree will be
undefeated. Idaho is the only weak sister.
Califronia end coach Eggs Manske, who scouted the Bruin-Card tiff,
came up with some interesting, and, yes. flattering observations on Stanford.
"I would say," began Manske, "that Stanford is 73 per cent improved
over k'st vcar. Yes. and that includes the 7 to 7 Big Game tie. People
have been saying that Stanford ends don't block, hut they certainly did
down there today (Saturday). The whole line blocked . . . and hard. And
these hacks arc fast . . . Hugasii-n, Southwood. and Cook. Also, I was
very impressed with Mathias. lie's going to he hard to stop.
"However, if USC were to play Stanford today, I'd have to pick the
Trojans by (i points. Those boys are rough. Stanford will have to improve j
to beat them."
The Broncos, who are a comparative breather, still won't bi.* any push- j
overs. If for no other reason than Bob Meyers, Jesse Cone, and Tsar Calfee j
will play wallflower this Saturday.
DISCOVERY DEPT. Coach "Red" Sanders of UCLA doesn't have red
hair at all, but black.
APOLOGY DEPT. In our game story, we referred to halfback Eric
Southwood as a pre-med student. Horrors, this is an ignorant oversight that
must be corrected. Southwood is a full-fledged member ot the frosh med
school.
LIL ABNER FAN. Captain Jesse Cone, all-Coast guard, is one of
the more erudite and well-spoken members of the team. He is also the
most devout comic hook fan.
The other day, Jesse and Norm Manoogian were in the training quarters,
bathing bruised appendages. Jesse was reading the Sunday comic strips to
Norm, "And it says here, Norm, that Snuffy Smith . . ."
"Well, whatta you know," said Norm.
Passers by could hardly believe that these were the two who reduce
opposing backs and linemen into nothingness each Saturday.

Special plaudits should go to Ron Eadie and Jack Rye for the smart
(and rough) game they played Saturday. They, more than anyone else, were i
responsible for Paul Cameron's poor showing. Also tab Gary Kerkorian for
all-American honors. Kerkorian is definitely having his best year and is ;
rhythm personified as he runs through the plays.
OPTIMIST DEPT. As Tsar Calfee, defensive tackle, was informed the
x-rays showed he had a broken ankle and would be out for six weeks, he
.said in General Mac Arthur fashion, "I shall return for the Rose Bowl."

"I would say," began Manske, "that Stanford is 73 per cent improved
over k'st vcar. Yes. and that includes the 7 to 7 Big Game tie. People
have been saying that Stanford ends don't block, hut they certainly did
down there today (Saturday). The whole line blocked . . . and hard. And
these hacks arc fast . . . Hugasii-n, Southwood. and Cook. Also, I was
very impressed with Mathias. lie's going to he hard to stop.
"However, if USC were to play Stanford today, I'd have to pick the
Trojans by (i points. Those boys are rough. Stanford will have to improve j
to beat them."
The Broncos, who are a comparative breather, still won't bi.* any push- j
overs. If for no other reason than Bob Meyers, Jesse Cone, and Tsar Calfee j
will play wallflower this Saturday.
DISCOVERY DEPT. Coach "Red" Sanders of UCLA doesn't have red
hair at all, but black.
APOLOGY DEPT. In our game story, we referred to halfback Eric
Southwood as a pre-med student. Horrors, this is an ignorant oversight that
must be corrected. Southwood is a full-fledged member ot the frosh med
school.
LIL ABNER FAN. Captain Jesse Cone, all-Coast guard, is one of
the more erudite and well-spoken members of the team. He is also the
most devout comic hook fan.
The other day, Jesse and Norm Manoogian were in the training quarters,
bathing bruised appendages. Jesse was reading the Sunday comic strips to
Norm, "And it says here, Norm, that Snuffy Smith . . ."
"Well, whatta you know," said Norm.
Passers by could hardly believe that these were the two who reduce
opposing backs and linemen into nothingness each Saturday.

Special plaudits should go to Ron Eadie and Jack Rye for the smart
(and rough) game they played Saturday. They, more than anyone else, were i
responsible for Paul Cameron's poor showing. Also tab Gary Kerkorian for
all-American honors. Kerkorian is definitely having his best year and is ;
rhythm personified as he runs through the plays.
OPTIMIST DEPT. As Tsar Calfee, defensive tackle, was informed the
x-rays showed he had a broken ankle and would be out for six weeks, he
.said in General Mac Arthur fashion, "I shall return for the Rose Bowl."
I*(JOT FOR CAL IHIS VVFI'.K. As you down your shredded wheat this
morning this is how the race for the roses shapes up. Stanford and USC
are undefeated; add Washington and Oregon State, and you have the four
contenders. Throw in Washington State and Cal (the Bears aren t eligible)
and you have two good spoilers.
Then be brave and take a look at Stanford's suicidal schedule. It con
tains all the above-mentioned, plus this week's "breather," Santa Clara. I
A Cal win this Saturday over USC would put Chuck Taylor's underlings
at the top of the heap, so forget what you think about the Bears for at
least one week and root for them against the Trojans. As it stands now, USC
is favored for the Pasadena classic, but the Huskies and OSC (with one loss
apiece) can't be counted out. Because with the fantastically tough PCC
competition this year, it's inconceivable that the Rose Bowl entree will be
undefeated. Idaho is the only weak sister.
