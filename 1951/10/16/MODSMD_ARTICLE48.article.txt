# Bronco Tilt Cards' Next

### 
Stanford's undefeated grid team
yesterday pointed itself for its next ,
opponent, Santa Clara, as Chuck !
Taylor ran his offensive unit
through their plays while placing j
the major burden on the defensive j
team.
Of the Bruin game, Taylor said, |
"We played our best game of the !
year against UCLA."
Since Santa Clara uses the T-for
mation and the Indians have faced
single - wing units — Michigan and
UCLA — for the past two weeks,
Taylor felt that the sooner his de
fense got ready for a "T" party the
better. The first defensive team set
up against the second varsity of
fense and did a good job of banging
heads during the short scrimmage, j
Stanford's injury problems have J
returned, but are still at a minimum
in relation to the past two years. I
Defensive tackle Tsar Calfee is the
•riost seroiusly injured, having bro- i
ken his ankle in the Bruin game.
Defensive guard Jesse Cone, a good
choice for All - Coast honors this
season, tore his knee ligaments in
the UCLA game, and is not due for
any action against the Broncos.
Halfback Harry Hugasian, with
bruised hands, and fullback Bob
Meyers, with a shoulder pointer, re
main question marks.
