# Mathias Sparks Ground Attack

BRUIN BLASTING BOBBY. Bob Mathias, decathelon champion, and newly found Stanford full
back plunges off UCLA's right tackle in the game Saturday. Mathias filled in for the injured
Bob Meyers who came up with a painful shoulder pointer. Bob not only scored the Card's last
two tallies on line plunges, but also gained forty-nine yards in seven carries for a neat seven
yard per carry average. Mathias faces heavy duty this weekend against an invading Santa Clara
eleven. â€”Daily photo by Frosty North
