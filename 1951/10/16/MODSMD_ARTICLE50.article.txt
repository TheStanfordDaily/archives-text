# Soccer: Fast, Action Packed Saturday Pre-Grid Sport
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Want to make this Saturday a sports double-header by viewing,
in addition to the football game, an exciting and grueling athletic
i contest?
You do! Then travel down to the soccer field in the morning
and watch what promises to be Stanford's best soccer team in

! years play.

The game may appear to be as
much of a jumble as rugby at first,
but scramble around, find a perch
slightly elevated, and the players
and maneuvers will swiftly unsort
1 themselves.
Should Stanford kick off, you'll
'te three -cardinal-jerseyed players
lined up in the center of the field
like the Belt of Orion constellation.
! One, the center forward, who will
probably be a lad from Istanbul,
Turkey, named Kifka Aldikachti,
| will kick off with a pass to one of
the men beside him, either the
I right or left inside.
| The starting forwards may also
! be players with names like Notre
j Dame's starting backfield: Dick Ku
nigsberger at left and Ghulam
j Ghaus. who has played since he
! was old enough to kick a ball in
i Kabul, Afghanistan, at right.
Positioning Ball
The inside will then boot the ball
! either down or across the field to
| one of two streaking gazelles called
wings or outside forwards. The
wing will attempt to either kick or
j head the ball into the center in
' front of the goal.
Here the melee uscrally arises,
with the forwards struggling with
| the defenders for a clear shot at
j the rectangular cage which is the
goal. If outsider do manage to get
I a shot past the goalie, it counts as
one point.
But should the defense clear the
ball back down the field to one
of their forwards, the burden of
play then falls upon the Card back
field men. who are in the main de
fenders, not ball-carriers.
Fullbacks Big. Fast
Three halfbacks, roving speedily

all over the field, will check the in
side forwards, and two burly lull
backs (usually the biggest or at
least toughest men on the squad)
will check the fleet wings.
The Stanford starting fullbacks
are no exception to the rule, John
Sentous and Bob Morris both mov
ing over 200 pounds surprisingly
fast around the field.
And at half you will see three of
the most spirited Card hooters.
Harry Haviiio at center half uses
every eligible part of his body con
ceivable to play the ball, and Derek
Liecly and Lew Lane ;it the outside
hall's play the game just as hard.

But gome opposing forward might
get through a shot at the goalie, in
which case you will suddenly real
ize a peculiar thing.
Surprising Thing
As the goalie either scoops the j
ball up. catches it ,or makes a head- i
long live to keep it out of the goal, |
he is the first player all day to touch |
the little leather globe with his i
hands! Only the goalie may catch
the ball.

The goalie, either Ben Swan. Bill |
Bergelund, or Peter Zarcardes, then j
plays the ball by dribbling it like a I
basketball a couple of times, then !
punting it far downfield.
