closer than the score indicates.

rolling up one first down, Fiji's Kirk
Evans threw a long pass which was
intercepted by Neill, who ran it
back for a touchdown. The try for

ning-fast Neill circled right end and
went all the way. The second try
for point also failed and ATO led
12 to 0. For the remainder of the

made one deep thrust which was
stopped just short of the goal.
After the kickoff, Fiji made two
more deep penetrations into ATO
territory but again failed to score.
j After the sccond failure, Fiji's of
fense was stopped cold and late in
the second half, ATO pushed across
two more scores.
Although badly rushed on almost
every play, Fiji's Evans kept Fiji in
the game until near the end with
his very accurate passing.
