# Will Japanese Treaty Succeed?
## Watkins Says Yes, Sees Hard Economic Future 
### DAVID WONG 
The Japanese Peace Treaty, concluded in San Francisco last
month, has settled many issues which have been the subject of
debate among laymen and experts alike for the last five years.
But one cardinal question still remains: Is the treaty going to
attain its objectives?
Dr. James T. Watkins IV, Associate Professor of Political Science

at Stanford, is of the opinion that
the gamble will succeed. In an in
terview, Dr. Watkins said that
harsher terms were not imposed on
the former enemy because it was
seen that punitive treaties, while
settling one war, usually sowed the
seeds for another.
Dr. Watkins' acquaintance with
Japan goes back to 1929, when he
went there as a teacher. He taught
for two years in Japan, followed by
another two years in China. Be
tween 1945 and 1946 Dr. Watkins
took part in the military govern
ment of the Ryukyu Islands, and a
year ago he visited Japan again and
taught at the Tokyo Imperial Uni
versity.
Dr. Watkins is also the chairman
of the Pacific Ocean Problems Sec
tion of the Commonwealth Club,
and has recently edited a report on
the Japanese peace settlement,
which was a subject of study by
that section.
Along with John Foster Dulles,
Dr. Watkins believes that the
treaty offered a peace of oppor
tunity. and conciliation for victors
and vanquished alike. Any real
ization of the peace settlement
must rest upon both parties.
In the case of Japan, he said, no
settlement can endure unless it pro
vides security for Japan as well as
the other nations, unless it permits
Japan to take her place as a mem
ber of the family of nations, and
unless it provides a reasonable
standard of living for the Japanese.
As far as security is concerned,
Japan cannot provide that her
self. Consequently, rather than to
create a military vacuum which
would invite aggression, the Unit
ed States and Japan have entered
into a bilateral agreement which
permits the stationing of United
States forces in and around Ja
pan.
At the same time, the United
States has made additional agree
ments with Australia and New Zea
land, and with the Philippines, in
order to reassure those countries
which fear a recrudescence of Jap
anese aggression.
"By the treaty itself, Japan is rec
ognized as having the right of self
defense in accordance with the
United Nations Chartcr. but Japan's
post-war reaction to militarism, her
economic weakness, and the pro
vision of her constitution renounc
ing war, arc all obstacles in the way
of effective self-defense," Dr. Wat
kins said.
In the peace treaty, Japan has
declared her intention to conduct
her foreign relations in the spirit
of the United Nations Charter and
her trade relations on the basis of
fair play. "She only has to live
up to this declaration to regain
that respect of other nations
which she enjoyed in the 1920'5,"
he continued.
However, Dr. Watkins forecast a
difficult economic future for Japan.
"Her economic resources are inade
quate to support so vast a popula
tion. Her problem is one of import

1 ing raw materials, manufacturing
i them into finished products, and ex-
I porting them at sufficient profit to
! pay for the food that she cannot
| produce, and the industrial mate- J
| rials she imports.
"In addition, Japan would be
I faced with increasing labor costs, |
difficulty in obtaining cheap raw
materials, and difficulty in finding I
I markets. And yet, without an ade
quate standard of living, Japan's j
present, political reforms would be
j gravely jeopardized.
"Therefore, while the negotiation
i of the treaty marks the end of the j
debate among the Allies, it also
1 marks the beginning of the long and
j hard road along which Japan must
j go, and go for the most part alone,"
j Dr. Watkins concluded.

Peace Treaty will work. He thinks that Japan must be allowed
to rebuild itself and take its place among other nations. Dr.

tunity. and conciliation for victors
and vanquished alike. Any real
ization of the peace settlement
must rest upon both parties.
In the case of Japan, he said, no
settlement can endure unless it pro
vides security for Japan as well as
the other nations, unless it permits
Japan to take her place as a mem
ber of the family of nations, and
unless it provides a reasonable
standard of living for the Japanese.
As far as security is concerned,
Japan cannot provide that her
self. Consequently, rather than to
create a military vacuum which
would invite aggression, the Unit
ed States and Japan have entered
into a bilateral agreement which
permits the stationing of United
States forces in and around Ja
pan.
At the same time, the United
States has made additional agree
ments with Australia and New Zea
land, and with the Philippines, in
order to reassure those countries
which fear a recrudescence of Jap
anese aggression.
"By the treaty itself, Japan is rec
ognized as having the right of self
defense in accordance with the
United Nations Chartcr. but Japan's
post-war reaction to militarism, her
economic weakness, and the pro
vision of her constitution renounc
ing war, arc all obstacles in the way
of effective self-defense," Dr. Wat
kins said.
In the peace treaty, Japan has
declared her intention to conduct
her foreign relations in the spirit
of the United Nations Charter and
her trade relations on the basis of
fair play. "She only has to live
up to this declaration to regain
that respect of other nations
which she enjoyed in the 1920'5,"
he continued.
However, Dr. Watkins forecast a
difficult economic future for Japan.
"Her economic resources are inade
quate to support so vast a popula
tion. Her problem is one of import

1 ing raw materials, manufacturing
i them into finished products, and ex-
I porting them at sufficient profit to
! pay for the food that she cannot
| produce, and the industrial mate- J
| rials she imports.
"In addition, Japan would be
I faced with increasing labor costs, |
difficulty in obtaining cheap raw
materials, and difficulty in finding I
I markets. And yet, without an ade
quate standard of living, Japan's j
present, political reforms would be
j gravely jeopardized.
"Therefore, while the negotiation
i of the treaty marks the end of the j
debate among the Allies, it also
1 marks the beginning of the long and
j hard road along which Japan must
j go, and go for the most part alone,"
j Dr. Watkins concluded.

Peace Treaty will work. He thinks that Japan must be allowed
to rebuild itself and take its place among other nations. Dr.

The Japanese Peace Treaty, concluded in San Francisco last
month, has settled many issues which have been the subject of
debate among laymen and experts alike for the last five years.
But one cardinal question still remains: Is the treaty going to
attain its objectives?
Dr. James T. Watkins IV, Associate Professor of Political Science

at Stanford, is of the opinion that
the gamble will succeed. In an in
terview, Dr. Watkins said that
harsher terms were not imposed on
the former enemy because it was
seen that punitive treaties, while
settling one war, usually sowed the
seeds for another.
Dr. Watkins' acquaintance with
Japan goes back to 1929, when he
went there as a teacher. He taught
for two years in Japan, followed by
another two years in China. Be
tween 1945 and 1946 Dr. Watkins
took part in the military govern
ment of the Ryukyu Islands, and a
year ago he visited Japan again and
taught at the Tokyo Imperial Uni
versity.
Dr. Watkins is also the chairman
of the Pacific Ocean Problems Sec
tion of the Commonwealth Club,
and has recently edited a report on
the Japanese peace settlement,
which was a subject of study by
that section.

declared her intention to conduct
her foreign relations in the spirit
of the United Nations Charter and
her trade relations on the basis of
fair play. "She only has to live
up to this declaration to regain
that respect of other nations
which she enjoyed in the 1920'5,"
he continued.
However, Dr. Watkins forecast a
difficult economic future for Japan.
"Her economic resources are inade
quate to support so vast a popula
tion. Her problem is one of import

1 ing raw materials, manufacturing
i them into finished products, and ex-
I porting them at sufficient profit to
! pay for the food that she cannot
| produce, and the industrial mate- J
| rials she imports.
"In addition, Japan would be
I faced with increasing labor costs, |
difficulty in obtaining cheap raw
materials, and difficulty in finding I
I markets. And yet, without an ade
quate standard of living, Japan's j
present, political reforms would be
j gravely jeopardized.
"Therefore, while the negotiation
i of the treaty marks the end of the j
debate among the Allies, it also
1 marks the beginning of the long and
j hard road along which Japan must
j go, and go for the most part alone,"
j Dr. Watkins concluded.


GAMBLE WILL SUCCEED—Dr. Jamos T. Watkins IV, associate
professor of political science at Stanford believes the Japanese
Peace Treaty will work. He thinks that Japan must be allowed
to rebuild itself and take its place among other nations. Dr.
Watkins taught in Japan for two years beginning in 1929. He
took part in the military government of the Ryukyu Islands in
1945 and 1946. —Daily photo by Roger Hagan
