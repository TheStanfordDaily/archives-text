# Cadets Rank High at Camp
## 
### 
The 34 Stanford ROTC cadets who
traveled to Camp Lee, Virginia, last
June for a six weeks' summer train
ing course were rated "superior" in
every classification, Col. James V.
Collier, commander of Stanford's
ROTC unit, revealed Friday.
Competing against units from 50
other American colleges, the Stan
ford contingent was one of the few
to complete the training program
with a superior rating.
In drill competition at the camp,
Stanford's company was rated out
standing. Also two Stanfordites
were awarded expert badges for
marksmanship and one Stanford ca
det, Rodney Garner, was selected
regimental adjutant for the final re
view.
