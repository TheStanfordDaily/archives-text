# Trial Today For Vandals' Campus Crimes
## 
### 
Vandal leader Dewey Chevalier
who, according to Stanford police,
bossed a teen aged gang in a series
of campus crimes will go to trial thus
morning at 10.
Appearing in court
Chevalier won a one-day postpone
ment from Judge Edward E. Hardy
after his attorney complained that
sufficient time had not been allowed
for the preparation of a case.
Chevalier is charged with inciting
Palo Alto and Menlo Park youths
into staging a wild spree of vandalism
last week in which a 60-foot C was
fired into the turf of Stanford Stad
ium and several autos were stripped.
Campus Police Chief Gordon Da
vis arrested Chevalier and five of
his 'teen-aged cohorts Friday and
charged them with vandalism in
connection with the turf-scorching.
Further investigation by Davis re
vealed, however, that Chevalier
was implicated in several car theft
cases.
One of the gang confessed to Da
vis that he had turned stolen auto
parts over to Chevalier who prom
ised to "fence" the goods. The youth
said that he had stolen fender skirts
and hub caps from cars parked in
the Roble parking lot last week.
The car clouter and two others of
Chevalier's associates pleaded guil
ty to charges of malicious mischief
Monday, and are scheduled to be
sentenced tomorrow following the
trial of their leader. The three are
all 18 years old. Chevalier is 23 and
is described as a "habitual trouble
maker" by police.
Two other members of the gang,
one 17 and the other 16, were
turned over to the California Youth
Authority which will handle their
cases.
Chief Davis, commenting on the
case yesterday, said that the arrest
of the "troublemakers" would put
an end to a series of incidents that
have occurred on campus since the
opening of fall quarter.
