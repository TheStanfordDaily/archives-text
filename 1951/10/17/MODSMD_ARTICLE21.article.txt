Great Drawing Card
Since his first American tour in
1938, Salvatore Baccaloni has heen
recognized in concert and in opera
as one of the greatest drawing cards
on the concert stage. His style,
(i humor, and voice bring distinction to
every performance.
Baccaloni has been with the Met
ropolitan Opera Company since 1940
! and is regarded as its number one
j singer-comedian. Operas which had
not been given in years at the Met
ropolitan for lack of a real hasso
buffo were dusted ofT and revived for
, him.
Voice Alone Holds Audiencc
Undeniably the greatest basso buffo
of his time, Baccaloni also has been
| received with equal enthusiasm as
. a serious concert, artist by leading
j critics of three continents. His love
] of opera and his love of the % concert
| stage are both equally important to
j him. He i:s able to walk out on the
I concert stage and hold an audience

spellbound, by virtue of his great
voice alone.
Accompanied by Paul Breisach at
the piano, the great basso buffo will
sing several selections from opera:
Übereto in "La Serva Padrona" by
i Pergolesi, "Les Veaux D'Or" from
j Gounod's Faust, Osmin in the "Ab
duction from the Seraglio" and Le
; porello in "Don Giovanni'' by Moz
art. Verdi's Falstaff, and Varlaam in
j "Boris Godounoff" and "Chanson de
la Puce" by Moussorgsky.
i Mr. Baccaloni will end his program
; with three negro spirituals: "Swing
Low Sweet Chariot," "Peter Go Ring
| dem Bells," and "My Lord What a
j Morning." Mr. Breisach will play

i Rhapsody in G Minor" by Brahms.
