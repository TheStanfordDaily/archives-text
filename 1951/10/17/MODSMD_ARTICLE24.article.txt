## 
### 
"The Foreign Service is vital to |
make the government of one nation !
: understand the governments of oth- j
J ers," said Dr. Graham H. Stuart,
i Stanford professor of political sei- '
once, at last night's Tuesday Eve- |
j ning Series program.
Dr. Stuart emphasized the tre- ;
' mendous loss of morale in the dip
j lomatic service caused by "MrCar
| thy's character assassination," and
i he discussed the changes of the past
| 16 years.
Agencies Expanded
j There has been a vast expansion |
in agencies dealing with economic j
policies and cultural relations, Dr. 1
I Stuart said, and the over-expanded i
j administration has caused a "regi-
I mented confusion," especially in the
, Paris embassy, which is the largest
j in Europe.
He discussed the tendency of the
American public to think that we i
j don't need men in the field because j
iof today's rapid communication.
This contention neglects the three i
most important, duties of any diplo
j mat abroad. A representative of
' the United States acts as an on-the
spot listening post to hear and in
' terpret facts.
He can see danger signals and has
the training and experience to rem
! edy difficulties almost before they
occur. It is the first duty of these i
men to maintain order, create good j
will and common understanding, j
and protect the interests of the
! United States.
