# Taft Declares '52 Candidacy
## Senator Sure Of Nomination 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UP)
—Sen. Robert A. Taft formally
declared his candidacy for the
1952 Republican presidential
nomination today and predicted
that "I will be nominated and
elected" on a militant anti-new
deal platform.
The Ohio Republican, who will be
making his third bid for the White
House once occupied by his father,
said a survey of party leaders and
rank-and-file members convinced
him he can wage "the only kind of
a campaign" that can win for the
GOP.
While the action had been ex
pected—the only question had been
the health of his wife and political
helpmate, Martha—Taft's announce
ment to a packed, kleig-lighted news
conference signaled the real start of
the 1952 Republican Presidential
race.
Anti-Taft Forces
Anti-Taft forces, headed by Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey of New York and
Sen. James H. DufT (R., Pa.), are
striving hard to swing the GOP
nomination to Gen. Dwight. D. Ei
senhower, chief of the new Western
European defense force.
Eisenhower supporters are ex
pected to open their own campaign
headquarters soon in Topeka, Kans.,
and Washington, although the gen
eral has not publicly declared his
willingness to run. Supporters are
sure Eisenhower will indicate his
answer soon and that it will be yes.
Taft, whose top-heavy re-election
victory in Ohio last year made him
an automatic GOP Presidential con
tender, made his formal announce
ment to some 100 reporters in the
huge Senate caucus room where h<"
has presided as "Mr. Republican"
for years as head of the GOP Pol
icy Committee.
Challenges Truman
In three prepared statements Taft
declared his candidacy, disclosed
his plans to enter the Ohio and Wis
consin primaries, and outlined a
platform challenging Truman ad
ministration foreign and domestic
policy.
The Ohio Senator claimed he al
ready has the nomination practical
ly in the bag. He said he is assured
of the delegates from some states
and that his prospects are so strong
in a sufficient number of other
states as "to constitute a majority
at the convention."
