SACRAMENTO, Oct. 16 (UP) â€” J
Gov. Earl Warren, often mentioned '
as a possible compromise candidate j
for the Republican Presidential j
nomination next year, wasn't a bit j
surpri ed today when Sen. Robert
A. Taft, R., Ohio, made his formal j
announcement.
Taft's announcement, Warren j
said, would "not in the slightest" j
affect his own plans in 1952.
