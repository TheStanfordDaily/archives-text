# Vandalism and Big Game
## 
### 
Vandalism? A nasty word but one that has
been Tossed around the Stanford campus pretty
often these past few weeks.
Somebody burns an SJS in the middle of
the football field. Two weeks later someone
burns a huge C in the turf, plus a smaller UCLA.
The Big Game Bonfire pile is tampered with
twice. All this means trouble for Stanford and
trouble for the vandals who getjcaught.
in the wake of this trouble comes a caller to
the office. He's the head of special committee
to discourage Big Game vandalism. And he's
a man who ought to know, because along with
10 other like-minded frosh, he was caught at
Berkeley last year trying to burn S's in Cal
lawns.
Instead of getting expelled from school this
man and his cohorts were given long Con Home
hours and then named by Men's Council to a

special committee to hold down vandalism this
fall.
It's early in the year for Big Game raid talk,
but then this anti-vandalism committee looks
like one of the hardest working outfits we've
seen lately. They think the student body
should be reminded right now of the anti-van
dalism pact between Stanford and Cal. And
they warn that the Fundamental Standard com
mittee will crack dov/n hard on any violators
this year.
We think these committee members are in a
good position to know what they're talking
about when they urge freshmen and other
students to stay clear of raids and any form of
property damage while getting ready for Big
Game. There are better ways to tame the
Berkeley Bear. They know.
