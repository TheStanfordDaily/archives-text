### PETE GROTHE 
TRIBUTE TO A DOG
You're supposed to be funny. You're supposed to
make some cracks about Rally Com or Cellar coffee.
But you've just visited home, and while you were
there your dog was brutally killed. And somehow you
just can't find it in your heart to be funny.

It's strange how a comparative
speck of a dog can make any dif
ference to you. But you remem
ber the Christmas when you were
first presented with a black Peki
nese puppy. You were a freshman
in high school at the time, and you
were insulted to get a peke. A
peke was one of those dogs that
.sat on a pink cushion with a rib
bon on its neck and was given
names like Fifi by old spinsters.

But the dog grew on you. In the ensuing months
he was housebroken, trained, scolded, loved, fed.
wormed and brought from puppyhood into doghood.
If you can call him a dog. He weighed all of 12 pounds,
and his size (or lack of it) and boundless energy
prompted people to call him a "perpetual puppy."
For reasons evident, he was named "Wacki." Not very
dignified for a peke with a pedigree a mile long, but
utterly fitting.
Wacki was the black-and-white opposite of (fie
stereotyped conception of a peke. He was an out
door dog from the word "go," and he'd romp all
around the hills with that funny little bow-legged
gait of his.
Wacki was the leader of the gang of dogs in the
neighborhood, even though he was a fraction of their
sizes. He was an underslung model, built so close to
the ground that a car once ran directly over him,
and never touched him. A neighbor saw Wacki dis
appear under the speeding car. gasped in horror,
closed her eyes as the car sped by, and then saw Wacki
come trotting up, sheepishly wagging his tail.
Wacki knew no fear and was the very definition of
devilishness. He was always seeing what trouble he
could get into next. When he wasn't disturbing our
cats or playfully nipping at our fingers, he was chasing
unwelcome dogs off the property. Once Wacki whipped

after a great dane arid chased the yelping dog 200
yards up the hill. The great dane probably could hove
made a mouthful of Wacki, and chances are that he
would have been mightly ashamed of himself if he
had turned around and seen the pipsqueak of a dog
that was pursuing him.
No pink-silk cushion dog. this Wacki.
And just as Wacki was a fighter, strutting and
arrogant, he was also a family dog, at once lovable
and affectionate. You think back and recall the way
he used to knock himself out in greeting you, jump
ing in little half-circles and wagging his tail at a
dizzy speed. You'd give the world to see him do
it just once more.
There was also a bit of the gay romancer in Wacki.
Not content with staying at home, he would take
walks around the hills at least twice a day. He would
make the rounds and be invited into many of the
neighbors' homes. He had an enthusiastic fan club
among the neighbors.
Wacki had an uncanny faculty for telling time. He
knew exactly when the workmen building nearby
houses would sit down to eat their lunch. And he
uncompromisingly made it a point to be there to share
in the workmen's noonday meals. He was a past
master at begging, being able to stand on his hind
legs for five minutes at a stretch. Wacki's aristocractic
background never stood in the way of his accepting
a hand-out. He liked to ride in cars, and every day
at 5:45 p.m. he would saunter to the end of the street
and wait for a certain neighbor who would drive home
from work at that time. It was a daily ritual: the
neighbor would stop, let Wacki in the car, drive 120
feet to our driveway, and deposit him there.
You think of all these things and then you think of
that morning when his life was taken from him. A
slate-gray sky was emitting a soft drizzle as Wacki,
who had been energy personilied. lay cold and life
less oil the wet pavement ... a victim of a vicious
dog who had killed two other dogs in the neighbor
hood.
And then you sort of half-smile. Because you know
that if there's a dog heaven, Wacki must be up there
. . . kicking up an awful fuss, and maybe pursuing
a great dane over a fleecy cloud.
