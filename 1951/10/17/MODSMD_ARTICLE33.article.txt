# CAMPUS OPINION
## On Football and Rosebowlitis 
### 
To the Editor:
"Root tor Cal over SC" sportswriter Grothe tells us.
Why? So that Stanford will lead all other Rose Bowl
contender-sand lx> tied with Super-Cal for the PCC
lead. All of which is just another symptom ol Rose
bowlitis.
Playing in the Rose Bowl would be fine and dandy,
to be sure, but why should this mean more than
winning the conference championship? Why should
we get all worked up over this New Year's Day ritual
for the exclusive benefit—and profit—of the city of
Pasadena? Sure, we stand a better chance of nursing
our New Year's hangovers in Pasadena than we do of
beating out Cal for the PCC title. So what? Why be
satisfied with being a second-rate team in the Rose
Bowl when there's still an outside chance that ours
can be the best team on the coast (which, of course,
would give us exclusive rights to the ''privilege" of
playing in the Ro*e Bowl anyway).
Forget Pasadena. If we're going to work up a sweat,
let it be not over Rose Bowl neckties and southbound
train reservations; but let's root for the Indians to
take all comers, including—and especially—those Big

Bud Bears, and go on to take the conference champion
ship. It' we go to Pasadena, let's do it as champions,
not as also-rans.
