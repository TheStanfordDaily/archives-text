# 'EVERYWHERE A FORM..."
## Batch's Secretaries Swamped In Work of Filing Draft Forms 
### WALT MENNINGER 
More than 1,000 students now classifed 2A by their local draft
boards can offer their thanks this week to Mrs. Virginia Brown,
Mrs. Barbara Crafts, and Mrs. Marie Knowlton.
These three women work in the office of the Chief Counselor
for Men, Richard Balch, and it has been their job to fill out and

I mail to local draft boards certifica
j tion of enrollment in Stanford for
| all 2A students.
The secretaries, along with Coun
| selor Balch and Assistant Counselor
Robert P. Huff, have been putting
| in what Balch "modestly" estimates
as 25 man-hours a day on the draft.
But, as Mrs. Crafts sighed thank
fully, "The rush is over."
The main problem offered by
the certification forms, Balch ex
plained. is that each state has its
own particular form, and by last
week the secretaries had encoun
j tered some 15 of the 4S different
blanks.
As if that weren't enough, some
states, like Arizona, require infor
mation which is duplicated on other
Selective Service forms, and one
state, Oregon, has changed its form
four different times since last May.
All of the forms ask such ques
tions as when the academic year
ends and whether or not the student
is "satisfactorily pursuing a full
time course of instruction." The

various wordings, however, are in
teresting.
The Ohio form states simply:
; "Registrant (has or has
I not) entered upon and is satisfac
torily pursuing a full-time course of
instruction." The New Mexico form
J makes the same statement, only
asking " Yes No" to be
I checked by the university.
At the opposite extreme, the Ari-
I zona blank is two pages long and
i asks for credits the student is tak-
I ing; and the Oregon form asks for
| the schedule of the student in ques
tion.
With all these forms cluttering
up the Counselor's office last
week, the secretaries were "form
happy," but Mrs. Brown said that
all is now going "pretty smooth
ly." The problem, Mrs. Knowl
! ton pointed out. is not the com
plexity of the forms, but "just the
hulk."
At the height of the form rush
late one afternoon last week, with

piles oi certification blanks here and
there all over the office, the secre
taries were prettv tired of it. It was
then, Mrs. Brown said, that some
one started it, and the whole office
took it up, singing:
"Ole Lei and Stanford had a Farm,
Eeii, Eeii, 000.
And on litis Farm lie had some
forms, Eeii. Eeii. 000.
Here a form, there a form,
Everywhere a form, form-—
Ole Leland Stanh-.d . . ."

for Men, Richard Balch, and it has been their job to fill out and

I mail to local draft boards certifica
j tion of enrollment in Stanford for
| all 2A students.
The secretaries, along with Coun
| selor Balch and Assistant Counselor
Robert P. Huff, have been putting
| in what Balch "modestly" estimates
as 25 man-hours a day on the draft.
But, as Mrs. Crafts sighed thank
fully, "The rush is over."
The main problem offered by
the certification forms, Balch ex
plained. is that each state has its
own particular form, and by last
week the secretaries had encoun
j tered some 15 of the 4S different
blanks.
As if that weren't enough, some
states, like Arizona, require infor
mation which is duplicated on other
Selective Service forms, and one
state, Oregon, has changed its form
four different times since last May.
All of the forms ask such ques
tions as when the academic year
ends and whether or not the student
is "satisfactorily pursuing a full
time course of instruction." The

various wordings, however, are in
teresting.
The Ohio form states simply:
; "Registrant (has or has
I not) entered upon and is satisfac
torily pursuing a full-time course of
instruction." The New Mexico form
J makes the same statement, only
asking " Yes No" to be
I checked by the university.
At the opposite extreme, the Ari-
I zona blank is two pages long and
i asks for credits the student is tak-
I ing; and the Oregon form asks for
| the schedule of the student in ques
tion.
With all these forms cluttering
up the Counselor's office last
week, the secretaries were "form
happy," but Mrs. Brown said that
all is now going "pretty smooth
ly." The problem, Mrs. Knowl
! ton pointed out. is not the com
plexity of the forms, but "just the
hulk."
At the height of the form rush
late one afternoon last week, with

piles oi certification blanks here and
there all over the office, the secre
taries were prettv tired of it. It was
then, Mrs. Brown said, that some
one started it, and the whole office
took it up, singing:
"Ole Lei and Stanford had a Farm,
Eeii, Eeii, 000.
And on litis Farm lie had some
forms, Eeii. Eeii. 000.
Here a form, there a form,
Everywhere a form, form-—
Ole Leland Stanh-.d . . ."
More than 1,000 students now classifed 2A by their local draft
boards can offer their thanks this week to Mrs. Virginia Brown,
Mrs. Barbara Crafts, and Mrs. Marie Knowlton.
