## So the Broncos Are a 'Breather' 
### "DIGGER" ODELL 
Ordinarily the price on the Rose Bowl tie would be sky-high this morn
ing off of the Curds' showing against the Bruins last Saturday. However,
wu are reminded that the season has just begun and all of the ton h tearvs
are still to be met.
With USC undefeated and Washington, Oregon State, and Washington
State not far behind—-not to mention Cal, who, though they won't go to
Pasadena, will be an important determinant of who does Stanford is
sitting on a very rocky 18th century antique. It .seems that the afore
mentioned sehools are unhappy at the thought of us representing them on
New Year's Day.
Our toughest foe, though, will always—and should always—he the
next one. Ami that «oes for this Saturday's opponent, the Santa Clara
Broncos. Go ahead and laugh at this "breather," but we predict that
they'll give us the biggest scare of the season if they don't beat us.
II you are the type who wants to brag that "you're" going to the Rose
Cowl, and who laughs at the non-conference games and calls them "rests,"
and then promptly heads for Berkeley to watch the Bears play, read the
following and we hope you choke on your chuckles.
Here are a number of reasons why the Broncos will be tough this week
end, and i! they beat us, whether or not it's a conference game, it will be
a very black mark against us. Remember Cul's ."54 to 0 win over Santa Clara
at the beginning of the year.
1. The Broncos, like San Jose State, have traditionally played over
their beads against the Indians. If they lost every game during the season
and beat the mighty Cards, there would be joy enough on the Santa Clara
campus to last a year.
In other words, the Broncos are going to be high for this game, while
the Indians, after their big surge to beat the Bruins, will most likely hit a
•lump after hearing all this "breather" business.
2. Ever hear of many teams stopping Don Klosterman, Loyola's famed
passing quarterback (spoken of in the same breath with Gary Kerkorian)?
Santa Clara did! Not only that, but they went on to beat the Lions Sunday,
20 to IG, showing that they have "arrived." Klosterman was held during
the afternoon to 12 completions in 30 attempts for 119 yards . . . maybe
a lot of completions but they obviously didn't go far. '
The Broncos' Johnny Pasco, on the other hand, did a lot better. lie
only threw 10 passes, but connected with four for ISO yards and two touch
downs, one an 80-yard touchdown, another a 91-yard TD.
3. The Indians will be without some very valuable services this Saturday.
T.sar Calfee is definitely out with a broken ankle, and Jesse Cone, Bob
Meyers, Skip Crist, and Harry Hugasian will probably do no more than
suit up.
Santa Clara is better off injury-wise. They have few ailments and all
their good men will be in there pitching. Look for a lot of Pasco. Gern
Nagler and Del Rasmussen, as well as Halfbacks Jack Kaplan, John Daly,
and Mel "80-bo" Lewis.
One more thing, if you're still not interested in this "breather." Count on
seeing a lot of Bub Mathias this wekend. Bob showed last Saturday against
UCLA that he's a mean man to stop, but he has yet to turn on his famed
speed full-force. With so many things to remember last week when he was
running (when and where to cut, for instance), Bob had little time to think
of Happing his wings, but with the details fast becoming second nature, look
for the fledging to My.

UCLA that he's a mean man to stop, but he has yet to turn on his famed
speed full-force. With so many things to remember last week when he was
running (when and where to cut, for instance), Bob had little time to think
of Happing his wings, but with the details fast becoming second nature, look
for the fledging to My.
Ordinarily the price on the Rose Bowl tie would be sky-high this morn
ing off of the Curds' showing against the Bruins last Saturday. However,
wu are reminded that the season has just begun and all of the ton h tearvs
are still to be met.
With USC undefeated and Washington, Oregon State, and Washington
State not far behind—-not to mention Cal, who, though they won't go to
Pasadena, will be an important determinant of who does Stanford is
sitting on a very rocky 18th century antique. It .seems that the afore
mentioned sehools are unhappy at the thought of us representing them on
New Year's Day.
Our toughest foe, though, will always—and should always—he the
next one. Ami that «oes for this Saturday's opponent, the Santa Clara
Broncos. Go ahead and laugh at this "breather," but we predict that
they'll give us the biggest scare of the season if they don't beat us.
II you are the type who wants to brag that "you're" going to the Rose
Cowl, and who laughs at the non-conference games and calls them "rests,"
and then promptly heads for Berkeley to watch the Bears play, read the
following and we hope you choke on your chuckles.
Here are a number of reasons why the Broncos will be tough this week
end, and i! they beat us, whether or not it's a conference game, it will be
a very black mark against us. Remember Cul's ."54 to 0 win over Santa Clara
at the beginning of the year.
1. The Broncos, like San Jose State, have traditionally played over
their beads against the Indians. If they lost every game during the season
and beat the mighty Cards, there would be joy enough on the Santa Clara
campus to last a year.
In other words, the Broncos are going to be high for this game, while
the Indians, after their big surge to beat the Bruins, will most likely hit a
•lump after hearing all this "breather" business.
2. Ever hear of many teams stopping Don Klosterman, Loyola's famed
passing quarterback (spoken of in the same breath with Gary Kerkorian)?
Santa Clara did! Not only that, but they went on to beat the Lions Sunday,
20 to IG, showing that they have "arrived." Klosterman was held during
the afternoon to 12 completions in 30 attempts for 119 yards . . . maybe
a lot of completions but they obviously didn't go far. '
The Broncos' Johnny Pasco, on the other hand, did a lot better. lie
only threw 10 passes, but connected with four for ISO yards and two touch
downs, one an 80-yard touchdown, another a 91-yard TD.
3. The Indians will be without some very valuable services this Saturday.
T.sar Calfee is definitely out with a broken ankle, and Jesse Cone, Bob
Meyers, Skip Crist, and Harry Hugasian will probably do no more than
suit up.
Santa Clara is better off injury-wise. They have few ailments and all
their good men will be in there pitching. Look for a lot of Pasco. Gern
Nagler and Del Rasmussen, as well as Halfbacks Jack Kaplan, John Daly,
and Mel "80-bo" Lewis.
One more thing, if you're still not interested in this "breather." Count on
seeing a lot of Bub Mathias this wekend. Bob showed last Saturday against
UCLA that he's a mean man to stop, but he has yet to turn on his famed
speed full-force. With so many things to remember last week when he was
running (when and where to cut, for instance), Bob had little time to think
