# Soccer Men Play Gators
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer team, riddled by
a Midden plague of injuries, will
trek to the city tonight to try to
make San Francisco State its third
straight victim.
A chartered bus will leave the
j;y;ii at C.20 carrying the team mem
bers to the game which will be
'played mrur the arcs at the Gator
i.occer field at 8:15.
'l'he iquad will probably be mi
nu two of its leading players and
have limited service at best from
two others. Heading the list is
halfback Ifarry Ilavilio, who has a
badiy sprained ankle.
Ilavilio, who has been able to
play only briefly in the Cards' first
two wins, figures to sit out tonight
?o lie will be ready to go against
USF Saturday.
In addition center forward Jeff
Mor.diead will not make the trip,
center half Derek Liecty will be
hobbled by an infected blister, and
left wing Raman Rao came out of
Monday's practice with a sprained
ankle.
So far this season San Francisco
State boasts a win over California,
always a .strong team. Nevertheless,
Coach Ru.ss Latham believes that
the Cards, who will be playing at
night for the first time this year, can
win.
