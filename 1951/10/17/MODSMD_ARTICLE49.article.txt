# Cards Prep For Broncs
## 
### 
Injuries continued to play host
yesterday as Chuck Taylor ran his
footballers through their second day
of propping for the Santa Clara
Broncos.
Four key players, in addition to
F ai Callee, who is out for the sea
on with a broken ankle, failed to
suit up for practice. Bob Bryan
took another dry oft to mend his
knee; Bob Griffin and Je.s e Cone
vert ai o on the sidelines with in
jured kne?s. Bob Meyers worked
out in sweat clothes with his arm in
a sling to keep his shoulder from
being jarred.
None of thee men are expected
to play Saturday against the Bron
cos with the exception of Bryan,
who e act on will depend upon how
his knee reacts to .'ay and the rest
of the week.
The often ive team ran through
plays for timing. Then Joe Ruetz
took the linemen down to one end
of the field for man-to-man block
ing practice, while Taylor worked
with the ends and backs on a pass
practice. During the latter, all three
quarterbacks—Gary Kerkorian, Bob
Garrett, and Jack Bickel — were
throwing well.
Meanwhile, the defensive platoon
was scrimmaging against the JV's
to get back in the habit of defend
ing against the 1 .formation, which
the Broncos use and use well.
Santa Clara will be expected to <lo
a lot of passing and quarterback
John Pasco is their ace. Two years
ago it was Pasco and end Larry
Williams who teamed up to hold
Stanford to a 7-7 tie, Santa Clar3*
went on to beat Kentucky in the
Orange Bowl 21-13.
Last week Pasco completed four
out of ten passes for 180 yards. Two
of his heaves were good for touch
downs. He completely outplayed
Loyola's highly touted Don Klos
terman, and if Johnny is hot Sat
urday the Cards could be in for a
rough afternoon.
