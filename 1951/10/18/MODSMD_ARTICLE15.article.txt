# Robust Buffo Sings and Acts In Rollicking First Concert
## 
### RONALD ROSEN 
Salvatore Baccaloni got the 1951-
52 Concert Series off to a rollicking
start as he sang and acted through
a program of operatic arias and
songs before a large and enthusias
tic audience last night.
Although displaying a somewhat
worn voice, Mr. Baccaloni never
theless showed that he still has a
"way" with the opera buffo style.
Baccaloni exercised a good range
of dynamics and fine style in the
aria "Son Imbrogliato" from "La
Scrva Padrone" by Pergolesi. He
was considerably less at home in
the famous "Calf of Gold" from the
opera "Faust." In this aria, Bac
caloni went beyond the robust style
asked for, and allowed his singing
to degenerate into a series of overly
boisterous shouts.
In his selections from the "Ab
duction from the Seraglio" by Mo
zart the soloist proved that he is
still a master of the light, comic
style of singing. Both the selections,

"Solche Heigilaufne Laffen" and
"Ha, wic will ich Triumphcren,"
were characterized by very fine, ar
tistically controlled singing, and a
very good dynamic range.
The "Madamina" from "Don Gio
vanni" was tossed off in a light and
frothy style which suits this aria
perfectly. Two Moussorgsky com
positions were performed in a man
ner distinctly non-Slavic in charac
ter, but Baccaloni nevertheless gave
a fine account of these selections.
The "Siege of Kazan" from "Boris
Godounoff" as usual proved to be a
show-stopping tour de force, while
the famous "Song of the Flea" was
given a broad reading which caught
the sardonic wit inherent in the
music.
Three spirituals, "Swing Low,
Sweet Chariot," "Peter, Go Ring
Dem Bells," and "My Lord, What a
Morning," found the soloist com
pletely lacking in the straightfor
ward simplicity needed for these
American classics.
