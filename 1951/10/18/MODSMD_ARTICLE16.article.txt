### 
A towering, 13,000 foot Alas-j
lean mountain was scaled for the '
first time this summer by two j
Stanfordites who named the |
giant peak after Stanford's first
president, David Starr Jordan.
The climbing of the newly named J
Mi. .Jordan will be described tonight. !
h1 a meeting of the Alpine Club in |
room 320 at 8. The public is invited.
Jon Lindberg and Bud Gates made
a 51 -day trip in Alaska's mountain
ous heart during the summer for
I ho purpose of scaling the St. Elias
range.
Packing their equipment, into the
rugged center of the snow-draped
northland, the three established a
ba-e camp on the 7,000 foot high
Klullan glacier.
The three Alpiners made the ascent
of Mt. Bear, the first venture of the
trip.
Though reaching the peak of the i
rugged mountain. Baxter nearly met
death during the climb when ho I
plunged through a snow-bridge iflto ;
a 70 foot crevass. Only the safety 1
rope made fast to him and his partner j
Lindberg saved him from pitching j
to the crevass's depth.
Following th e Bear Mountain
climb, the three scaled 16,400 foot Mt.
Bonn and then struggled up the 15,700
foot incline of Mt. Lippmann.
As their final venture of the sum

mer, Baxter and Lindberg decided to
explore the snow-blanketed wind
whipped mountain which they named
Mt. Jordan.
The ascent of the mountain was
difficult as the two students were
snared in the center of a swirling

snowstorm. Though attaining the
peak, the two found return to camp
nearly impossible as the trail was
shrouded in snow. Only by follow
ing occasional markers left along
their path were they able to return j
to camp.
