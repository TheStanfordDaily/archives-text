# GOP Youths Want Club
## 
### 
Excom heard a request by the
Young Republicans last night that
their club be allowed to reorganize
on campus.
Merrill Memsor, representative of
the Young Republicans, told Excom
that the main purpose of the club
would be to provide information con
cerning the Republican party and to
handle arrangements for absentee
ballots of students.
The charter of the Young Repub
licans will be presented to Excom
next week, at which time there will
be further discussion on the club's
request. It was pointed out that if
the Young Republicans were incor
porated by the ASSU they would
have to act within the limits set by
Excom. The Young Republicans had
an organization on campus prior to
the last war.
Alice Jones was appointed to the
Union Board of Governors. Other
business approved at the meeting was
an allotment of 40 dollars to cover
the transportation expenses of five
cheer leaders to the Washington
game in Seattle.
Karl Roeloffs, ASSU foreign scholar
from Germany, gave a report on his
life in Germany and how he got to
Stanford. Roeloffs, who taught last
year in the Eastern Zone, related
some of the work being done abroad
to promote international understand
ing. Each week Excom hears a re
port from one of the ASSU foreign
scholars.
