TOKYO—The U.S. First Cavalry
Division burst through a curtain of
Communist mortar and artillery fire
today and captured a hill northwest
of Yonchon, while some 25 miles
to the west American forces closed
in on 800 trapped Chinese below
Kumsong.
The Communist screening forces
appeared to be falling back on their
main winter line where they have
concentrated artillery. The UN was
believed to have reached the line in
the east and west and to be feeling
for it in the center.
