# Some Rushing Rules Clarified
## 
### 
Rush.ng is a messy business at best. Stan
ford, at least, has taken steps to keep the rush
ing program definitely under control. Delayed
rushing is the rule here, with no social contact
allowed until winter quarter when the program
starts.
The latest step to keep rushing under a con
trolled plan was taken last week when eating
club men and fraternity men agreed to conduct
their rushing programs at the same time. This
was the only sensible thing to do and it recog
nizes the increased stature of the clubs, which
finally have their long-awaited building.
Some oi the fraternity rushinq rules were
clarified last week also. A point of conten
tion has been the status of the second-quarter
freshman. Interfraternity Council's rulinq is
that no man who has less than 45 Stanford
units or the equivalent may be rushed until
the regular winter quarter rushinq season.
All these men are subject to the reqular "no

social contact" rules.
Interfraternity Council also wants it known
to all freshmen in general that no social contact
means no SOCIAL contact. This doesn't mean
no contact at all. Frosh are encouraged to par
ticipate in extracurricular activities, where the
presence of fraternity men shouldn't scare any
one away.
The idea behind the rushing rules is to pre
vent any "under the table" rushing and to let
freshmen get acquainted with Stanford as a
class and not as a house. Don't get the idea
that you can't maintain normal relationships
with fraternity men. This actually would defeat
the Stanford purpose of recognizing students
as Stanford men and women and not merely
as Greeks or independents.
And right now nobody's rushing anyway,
so don't stay av/ay from the Row Carnival
just because the name frightens you.
