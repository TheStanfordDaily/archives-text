# BULL SESSION
## A 						WARNING 
### DICK McLEAN 
Now Valdemar was a nice guy. Kind of strange
but nice all the same. I first met him in a history
seminar. This course was largely concerned with re
search. It required long hours in. the stacks with the
artificial light of a single globe and the musty smell
of printed antiquity. Here Valdemar excelled. That
little, bespeckled. gnome-like man seamed to thrive
in the dank air of the library cat- J

aeombs. He could find source ma
terials that were believed non
existant, he could trace a book or
a rare manuscript to the very in
cinerator where it had been de
stroyed fifteen years before. The
world of ancient books was Valde
mar's and there he lived and there
the mystery begins.
I thought it was kind of strange
when he missed the weekly meet-

ing of the class. This difficult three hour session was
to him what Friday afternoon at Rossotti's, Saturday
night at the "Egg." and the noisemaker in the Sunday
night flick is to all normal people. If Valdemar was
absent, I figured that he would have to be nearly dead.
I called the hospital and the Rest Home. No Val
demar. I called his residence. They hadn't seen him
since the day before. I asked all the people that
knew him. The trail pointed toward the library.
That's where 1 knew he must he.
Before anyone goes into the stacks, he must pledge
his life away, beg a permit, and sign the library di
rectory. When a person leaves he puts a check after
his name to signify that he is finished.
With genuine fear did I scan those long lists of
names, each with a check after it. until I found Valde
mar's precise signature. There was no check. That
half recognized fear that had plucked at the back of
my brain now rang as proof before my eyes. Some
where between anthropology and zoology, in some
area between John Adams and Peter Zenger a living

human being was caught in a prison of paper. Valde
mar was lost somewhere in the stacks. And 1 had to
find him.
Armed with what little courage I possess, a flash
light, a map of the library, and a stack permit I began
the descent. As I walked down the first flight of steps,
the gloom and dank air enveloped me. I snapped on
my electric torch and played it up and down the rows
and columns. And then a book with a pink marker in
it caught my eye. The book concerned one Johnathon
Filbert (born 1624—died 1675). The marker was Val
demar's. Written on it was a reference to some other
book four floors below.
Slowly I climbed down the verticle wooden ladders
into the musty blackness. The echoing drip of seep
ing water mingled with the shuffle of rats. And
pervading over all was the sweet smell of mould
ing papers. I found the hook that Valdemar had
mentioned. But inside was another pink reference
slip. He was persuing Johnathon Filbert even deeper
into the pit of the main library.
At last in my search of Valdemar and his 17th cen
tury friend I reached the ultimate cellar. I had to
cover my mouth with a hankerchief to keep out the
.sulphurous stench of the sewers that gurgled and
bubbled past. Green slime hung in festoons from
the walls. The rats were Isold and as big as cats.
I knew that I must find my friend now, for if I waited
any longer, it would be too late. Finally I uncovered
the last book—the original diary of Johnathon Filbert.
When I read the entry marked with the pink slip,
I knew my search was over. The entry read:
"Oct. 16th, 1650—Todaye a rather strange
thing happened in my librarye. I
found an oddly dressed young man
hrousing among my books. He seemed
right nice and harmless so I let
hym stay. His name was Valdemar."
Now 1 don't fully understand what happened. I
never will. But be you all know of this if nothing
else—don't ever, ever go in the stacks. You never
know what you'll find or where you'll be found.

.sulphurous stench of the sewers that gurgled and
bubbled past. Green slime hung in festoons from
the walls. The rats were Isold and as big as cats.
I knew that I must find my friend now, for if I waited
any longer, it would be too late. Finally I uncovered
the last book—the original diary of Johnathon Filbert.
When I read the entry marked with the pink slip,
I knew my search was over. The entry read:
"Oct. 16th, 1650—Todaye a rather strange
thing happened in my librarye. I
found an oddly dressed young man
hrousing among my books. He seemed
right nice and harmless so I let
hym stay. His name was Valdemar."
Now 1 don't fully understand what happened. I
never will. But be you all know of this if nothing
else—don't ever, ever go in the stacks. You never
know what you'll find or where you'll be found.

Now Valdemar was a nice guy. Kind of strange
but nice all the same. I first met him in a history
seminar. This course was largely concerned with re
search. It required long hours in. the stacks with the
artificial light of a single globe and the musty smell
of printed antiquity. Here Valdemar excelled. That
little, bespeckled. gnome-like man seamed to thrive
in the dank air of the library cat- J

aeombs. He could find source ma
terials that were believed non
existant, he could trace a book or
a rare manuscript to the very in
cinerator where it had been de
stroyed fifteen years before. The
world of ancient books was Valde
mar's and there he lived and there
the mystery begins.
I thought it was kind of strange
when he missed the weekly meet-

ing of the class. This difficult three hour session was
to him what Friday afternoon at Rossotti's, Saturday
night at the "Egg." and the noisemaker in the Sunday
night flick is to all normal people. If Valdemar was
absent, I figured that he would have to be nearly dead.
I called the hospital and the Rest Home. No Val
demar. I called his residence. They hadn't seen him
since the day before. I asked all the people that
knew him. The trail pointed toward the library.
That's where 1 knew he must he.
Before anyone goes into the stacks, he must pledge
his life away, beg a permit, and sign the library di
rectory. When a person leaves he puts a check after
his name to signify that he is finished.
With genuine fear did I scan those long lists of
names, each with a check after it. until I found Valde
mar's precise signature. There was no check. That
half recognized fear that had plucked at the back of
my brain now rang as proof before my eyes. Some
where between anthropology and zoology, in some
area between John Adams and Peter Zenger a living

human being was caught in a prison of paper. Valde
mar was lost somewhere in the stacks. And 1 had to
find him.
Armed with what little courage I possess, a flash
light, a map of the library, and a stack permit I began
the descent. As I walked down the first flight of steps,
the gloom and dank air enveloped me. I snapped on
my electric torch and played it up and down the rows
and columns. And then a book with a pink marker in
it caught my eye. The book concerned one Johnathon
Filbert (born 1624—died 1675). The marker was Val
demar's. Written on it was a reference to some other
book four floors below.
Slowly I climbed down the verticle wooden ladders
into the musty blackness. The echoing drip of seep
ing water mingled with the shuffle of rats. And
pervading over all was the sweet smell of mould
ing papers. I found the hook that Valdemar had
mentioned. But inside was another pink reference
slip. He was persuing Johnathon Filbert even deeper
into the pit of the main library.
At last in my search of Valdemar and his 17th cen
tury friend I reached the ultimate cellar. I had to
cover my mouth with a hankerchief to keep out the
.sulphurous stench of the sewers that gurgled and
bubbled past. Green slime hung in festoons from
the walls. The rats were Isold and as big as cats.
