# CAMPUS OPINION
## More of 'Better Third at Football Games 
### 
To the Editor:
With due respect to the Fundamental Standard, we
of the men's rooting section believe that Stanford
coeds should be allowed more participation during
the extra events of football games.
Some suggestions for improvement are: 1. More
fitting clothes for the task of cheer leading. As it
stands now, the tight skirt and loose sweater sepm
to be the reverse qualifications (a loose skirt would
be more fitting). 2. A few of the rally girls in front
ol the men's rooting section. Cheer Leader Susie, of
a lew years back, used to help lead the men's section
in yells, with great success. It could be done again.
3. A Drum Majorette to add further color to the band.
II the F. S. objects to a girl on the field, perhaps she
could wear high button shoes, an ankle length skirt
and a middie blouse. Nevertheless, it would be good
to see Stanford's "better third" represented out there.
Maybe Rally Com will look into these suggestions.

We just want to say thank you and thank you again
for the great kindness you offered us last Friday
evening. Two D.U. fraternity brothers from your uni
versity, in their most courteous manner, disassembled
their homecoming float after the parade and presented
to us a large Stanford Indian and a Bruin's head.
1 hes'e will be used on our float at our home coming
parade at Berkeley the night previous to Big Game.

It is indeed a great pleasure to see such good will
extended across the bay when we intend to change
the Bruin to a victorious Oski, and the happy Indian
to ft very much defeated one. How different the situ
ation would have been, had they known we were
California Coeds.

To the Editor:
There is an office in the Inner Quad which does a
lot of good to Stanford's students from abroad. It is
the office of the Foreign Students Advisor, headed by
Mrs. Vogel.
I feel that Stanford students coming from all parts
of the globe, who have availed themselves of the help
and advice offered by Mrs. Vogel's office, will agree
with me that she is doing a wonderful job.
Yet very few know about the work of the Foreign
Students Advisor, and so I think that credit should
be given where credit is due.

To the Editor:
There is an office in the Inner Quad which does a
lot of good to Stanford's students from abroad. It is
the office of the Foreign Students Advisor, headed by
Mrs. Vogel.
I feel that Stanford students coming from all parts
of the globe, who have availed themselves of the help
and advice offered by Mrs. Vogel's office, will agree
with me that she is doing a wonderful job.
Yet very few know about the work of the Foreign
Students Advisor, and so I think that credit should
be given where credit is due.

To the Editor:
With due respect to the Fundamental Standard, we
of the men's rooting section believe that Stanford
coeds should be allowed more participation during
the extra events of football games.
Some suggestions for improvement are: 1. More
fitting clothes for the task of cheer leading. As it
stands now, the tight skirt and loose sweater sepm
to be the reverse qualifications (a loose skirt would
be more fitting). 2. A few of the rally girls in front
ol the men's rooting section. Cheer Leader Susie, of
a lew years back, used to help lead the men's section
in yells, with great success. It could be done again.
3. A Drum Majorette to add further color to the band.
II the F. S. objects to a girl on the field, perhaps she
could wear high button shoes, an ankle length skirt
and a middie blouse. Nevertheless, it would be good
to see Stanford's "better third" represented out there.
Maybe Rally Com will look into these suggestions.

We just want to say thank you and thank you again
for the great kindness you offered us last Friday
evening. Two D.U. fraternity brothers from your uni
versity, in their most courteous manner, disassembled
their homecoming float after the parade and presented
to us a large Stanford Indian and a Bruin's head.
1 hes'e will be used on our float at our home coming
parade at Berkeley the night previous to Big Game.

It is indeed a great pleasure to see such good will
extended across the bay when we intend to change
the Bruin to a victorious Oski, and the happy Indian
to ft very much defeated one. How different the situ
ation would have been, had they known we were
California Coeds.
