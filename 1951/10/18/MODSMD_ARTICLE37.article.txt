# Hoover Tower Devotes 12 Floors to Peace Studies
## 
### MARY MASSEY 
When you look out from the platform of Hoover Tower, you
are standing above 12 floors devoted to research on peace through
the collection and preservation of historical materials and instruc
tion in the problems of peace.
War, revolution, and peace are the focal points for this unceas-

ing study. In the held ot war, eco
nomic and social aspects are
stressed more than strict military
causes. Revolutionary movements,
particularly of this century, are
considered. Materials on peace, the
third field, include the whole range
of international relations and the
history of the peace movement.
10 Years Old
Dedicated in 1941, the 285-foot
tower actually had its beginnings
during the first World War when
Herbert Hoover was chairman of
the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Impressed with the difficulty
of obtaining contemporary docu
ments years after they were con
temporary, Hoover began his col
lection enterprise.
Stanford entered the scene by
providing the expert aid in gather
ing the material that Hoover need
ed. Through the university, he re
ceived the staff that organized a
group of collectors composed of
young scholars released from mil
itary service.
Goodwill Helps
The initial collecting was greatly
aided by the fact that most govern
ments were well disposed toward
the United States and Hoover's
wide - spread humanitarian activi
ties. Dr. Ralph H. Lutz and Dr.
Frank A. Colder, the principal col
laborators, and others were thus
able to secure materials relating to
the revolutions of 1917, 1918, and
1919, and to the new states and their
problems.
Since it was obvious that the
causes of the war went back be
yond 1914, a library of printed
works dealing with the political and
economic background of the war
was added to the collection. Simi
larly, it proved to be impossible to
stop in 1920 after the postwar trea
ties had been signed. As the scope
of the collection broadened, the
Hoover War Collection became the
Hoover War Library.
World War II
Continuing its collections through

j tiie years, the Library undertook to
j include World War II and its after
math. This resulted in the present
i Hoover Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace.
In this way, the Library's inter
ests have widened from Western
Europe and the United States to all
continents. Its activities now in
clude research, publication, and ad
vanced study under the Hoover Re
| search Institute, as well as the
| original collection and preservation
| of materials.
Hoover's Purpose
Hoover expressed the aim of the
Library at its dedication when he
said: "And here are the documents
which record the suffering, the self
denial. the devotion, and the heroic
deeds of men. Surely from these
records there can be help to man
j kind in its confusions and perplexi
j ties, and its yearnings for peace."


HOOVER MONSTER'S ESCAPE—The Hoover Tower Library
is not only the home of 12 floors of books and documents, it
is also the chosen habitat of an invisible monster. When the
monster tires of his cell he escapes down the side of the tower,
(with the help of the Alpine 4 Club) leaving behind a path of
large black footprints.

i Hoover Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace.
In this way, the Library's inter
ests have widened from Western
Europe and the United States to all

Hoover's Purpose
Hoover expressed the aim of the
Library at its dedication when he
said: "And here are the documents
which record the suffering, the self
denial. the devotion, and the heroic
deeds of men. Surely from these
records there can be help to man
j kind in its confusions and perplexi
j ties, and its yearnings for peace."


HOOVER MONSTER'S ESCAPE—The Hoover Tower Library
is not only the home of 12 floors of books and documents, it
is also the chosen habitat of an invisible monster. When the
monster tires of his cell he escapes down the side of the tower,
(with the help of the Alpine 4 Club) leaving behind a path of
large black footprints.
When you look out from the platform of Hoover Tower, you
are standing above 12 floors devoted to research on peace through
the collection and preservation of historical materials and instruc
tion in the problems of peace.
War, revolution, and peace are the focal points for this unceas-

ing study. In the held ot war, eco
nomic and social aspects are
stressed more than strict military
causes. Revolutionary movements,
particularly of this century, are
considered. Materials on peace, the
third field, include the whole range
of international relations and the
history of the peace movement.
10 Years Old
Dedicated in 1941, the 285-foot
tower actually had its beginnings
during the first World War when
Herbert Hoover was chairman of
the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Impressed with the difficulty
of obtaining contemporary docu
ments years after they were con
temporary, Hoover began his col
lection enterprise.
Stanford entered the scene by
providing the expert aid in gather
ing the material that Hoover need
ed. Through the university, he re
ceived the staff that organized a
group of collectors composed of
young scholars released from mil
itary service.
Goodwill Helps
The initial collecting was greatly
aided by the fact that most govern
ments were well disposed toward
the United States and Hoover's
wide - spread humanitarian activi
ties. Dr. Ralph H. Lutz and Dr.
Frank A. Colder, the principal col
laborators, and others were thus
able to secure materials relating to
the revolutions of 1917, 1918, and
1919, and to the new states and their
problems.
Since it was obvious that the
causes of the war went back be
yond 1914, a library of printed
works dealing with the political and
economic background of the war
was added to the collection. Simi
larly, it proved to be impossible to
stop in 1920 after the postwar trea
ties had been signed. As the scope
of the collection broadened, the
Hoover War Collection became the
Hoover War Library.
World War II
Continuing its collections through

j tiie years, the Library undertook to
j include World War II and its after
math. This resulted in the present
i Hoover Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace.
