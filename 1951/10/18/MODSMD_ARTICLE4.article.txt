### 
FLUSHING. N.Y., Oct. 17 â€”The
United Nations Security Council
tonight postponed until Friday a
vote on the American-backed Brit
ish proposal for new Anglo-Iranian
oil talks.
The unexpected postponement
camp after a four-hour debate in
which the United States told Iran
ian Premier Mohammed Mossadegh
he is dead wrong in challenging the
UN's legal right to act in the fes
tering Anglo-Iranian dispute.
Mossadegh told newsmen as he
hobbled out after today's session: "I
shall not he present for the vote on
Friday because we do not accept
any recommendations or advice
from the Security Council."
He argued that the dispute is
strictly a domestic affair of Iran in
which the UN has no right to act.
