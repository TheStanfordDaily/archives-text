## Mad Mutterings

Time has now come to take issue with u piece written some two weeks
ago by one of the brethren sports writers. He was sadly contemplating the
fact that we were not offered much of a football schedule to view in Stanford
Stadium this year. In the bracket of poor drawing cards he included Santa
Clara, Washington State, and Oregon State.
The fact that Santa Clara will put on a good show Saturday and that she
promises to be not much of a "breather" for the Cards has been well dis
played in this week's columns already and will not be considered here, but
the time has further come to state that Stanford's Big Ked Machine is going
to have really rugged going before it FLATTENS MSSRS. COUGAR AND
BEAVER.
Comments which have been made on the subject of WSC and OSC boil
down to about the following which are most pertinent:
On the Cougars, just after they had finished scoring 35 points on the
best players he had, Pappy Waldorf of Cal enthused: "The best offensive
team I've seen in my five years in the Pacific Coast Conference." In retrospect
on Monday morning the Cougars had still left enough impression on Waldorf
to prompt him to state: "Washington State will score two or three times
against any team in the country."
While Pappy may be a bit awed in view of the fact that no one else had
scored five TD's on him in a long time, let's go back a couple of weeks to
find Coach Dick Gallagher of Santa Clara musing that Washington State
(WSC beat the Broncos 34 to 20) punished us much more physically than
Cal did." (And the Bears won by a bigger score, 34 to 0).
OSC, everyone knows, held mighty Michigan State to a lucky 6 to 0
win and then almost upended Southern Cal, which thinks rightly that it is
.some punkins this year. The Trojans could manage only 80 yards on the
ground against the Beavers and had to come from behind to score their
points on: a 20 yard "sustained" drive after a pass interception, a fourteen
yard disputed pass play on which even the movies do not show whether or
not tailback Frank Gifford was over scrimmage when he tossed the ball,
and a game-winning fourth quarter field goal.
Let's face it; with the exception of O'regon we are playing real football
in the coast conference this year. IT'S TOUGH FOOTBALL TO BEAT
AND IT'S GOOD FOOTBALL TO WATCH!
<i # *
THEY PLAY FOR KEEPS EVEN IN MURALS—In a Monday intra
mural football contest between Theta Chi and Alpha Delta Phi the going
really got rugged. The final score was a frustrating 6 to 6. but in between
Bill Ford, Theta Chi, got whacked hard enough to need eight stitches in
his mouth, and Verne Anderson, Alpha Delt, had three teeth, two false
and a real one broken. The two teams are leading contenders for the campus
crown and play in a tough league with a couple of other leading squads, the
Phi Kaps and the Zetes.
BONBONS TO CARDINALS—No one else has yet said so in print, but
Cardinals deserve plaudits for their decision to show movies of the UCLA
game and other important home games in addition to contests played away.
You really could see a lot more of the Bruin game in the movies than you
could in between rah-rahs last Saturday. Further cheers for the swell float
parade, and for the decision to hold it separately from the Homecoming
House Decorations. Apparently Cardinals is beginning to think 4pr the first
time in a couple of years. Big game week could be really sensational!
KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. MEN —In case you have not noticed
NO STANFORD VARSITY TEAM HAS LOST A GAME YET THIS FALL.
The soccermen, water polo team, and football squad are all undefeated.
Likewise is the JV football team, and only an inexperienced JV water polo
team mars the picture with three successive losses.

mural football contest between Theta Chi and Alpha Delta Phi the going
really got rugged. The final score was a frustrating 6 to 6. but in between
Bill Ford, Theta Chi, got whacked hard enough to need eight stitches in
his mouth, and Verne Anderson, Alpha Delt, had three teeth, two false
and a real one broken. The two teams are leading contenders for the campus
crown and play in a tough league with a couple of other leading squads, the
Phi Kaps and the Zetes.
BONBONS TO CARDINALS—No one else has yet said so in print, but
Cardinals deserve plaudits for their decision to show movies of the UCLA
game and other important home games in addition to contests played away.
You really could see a lot more of the Bruin game in the movies than you
could in between rah-rahs last Saturday. Further cheers for the swell float
parade, and for the decision to hold it separately from the Homecoming
House Decorations. Apparently Cardinals is beginning to think 4pr the first
time in a couple of years. Big game week could be really sensational!
KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. MEN —In case you have not noticed
NO STANFORD VARSITY TEAM HAS LOST A GAME YET THIS FALL.
The soccermen, water polo team, and football squad are all undefeated.
Likewise is the JV football team, and only an inexperienced JV water polo
team mars the picture with three successive losses.
Time has now come to take issue with u piece written some two weeks
ago by one of the brethren sports writers. He was sadly contemplating the
fact that we were not offered much of a football schedule to view in Stanford
Stadium this year. In the bracket of poor drawing cards he included Santa
Clara, Washington State, and Oregon State.
The fact that Santa Clara will put on a good show Saturday and that she
promises to be not much of a "breather" for the Cards has been well dis
played in this week's columns already and will not be considered here, but
the time has further come to state that Stanford's Big Ked Machine is going
to have really rugged going before it FLATTENS MSSRS. COUGAR AND
BEAVER.
Comments which have been made on the subject of WSC and OSC boil
down to about the following which are most pertinent:
On the Cougars, just after they had finished scoring 35 points on the
best players he had, Pappy Waldorf of Cal enthused: "The best offensive
team I've seen in my five years in the Pacific Coast Conference." In retrospect
on Monday morning the Cougars had still left enough impression on Waldorf
to prompt him to state: "Washington State will score two or three times
against any team in the country."
While Pappy may be a bit awed in view of the fact that no one else had
scored five TD's on him in a long time, let's go back a couple of weeks to
find Coach Dick Gallagher of Santa Clara musing that Washington State
(WSC beat the Broncos 34 to 20) punished us much more physically than
Cal did." (And the Bears won by a bigger score, 34 to 0).
OSC, everyone knows, held mighty Michigan State to a lucky 6 to 0
win and then almost upended Southern Cal, which thinks rightly that it is
.some punkins this year. The Trojans could manage only 80 yards on the
ground against the Beavers and had to come from behind to score their
points on: a 20 yard "sustained" drive after a pass interception, a fourteen
yard disputed pass play on which even the movies do not show whether or
not tailback Frank Gifford was over scrimmage when he tossed the ball,
and a game-winning fourth quarter field goal.
Let's face it; with the exception of O'regon we are playing real football
in the coast conference this year. IT'S TOUGH FOOTBALL TO BEAT
AND IT'S GOOD FOOTBALL TO WATCH!
