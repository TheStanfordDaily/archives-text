# 75 Basketballers Run Through Paces
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Fireballer Bobby Burnett, who took over the helm of Stanford's
basketball destinies in the wake of Everett Dean's sudden resig
nation last spring, paced 75 cagers through the year's initial work
out Monday afternoon.
The practices are continuing at the Pavilion daily at 4 p.m.

Foremost among the large turn
out, which included both freshman
and varsity candidates, were seven
lettermen from Dean's 1951 third
place club. These men—starters Ed
Tucker, Jim Ramstead. Jim Walsh,
and Bruce Iversen plus reserves

Gary Andrews, Paul Johnson, and
Bill Stevenson—will form the nu
cleus of a squad Burnett believes
to be a definite contender for the
1952 Southern Division flag.
Only Jumping Jack O'Sullivan.
'51 captain, has been lost from the
starting five.
One reason for Burnett's opti

mism is the standout group of
sophomores moving up from last
year's best - ever frosh (coached
liy one Bobby Burnett). Sky
j scrapers I)ave Epperson ((> ft. (J
I in.) and Don Carlson ((> ft. 4 in.)
and scrappy guard Oleg Su/.daletl
are almost sure bets for varsity
berths, as is (>-ft. 4-in. Kirk Pol
[ zine, another sophomore, who did
5 his firing as an All-Conference
pivotman with Modesto JC last
I season.
The Farm's prize prep catch, Fre
| mont's Ron Tomsic, will be avail-
I able for varsity work under the new
j conference frosh - eligibility ruling.
I Tomsic, now in his second quarter
;at Stanford, rated All-City honors
i three years running while at Fre
' mont.
The Card five will break a tradi
tion of long standing when they
raise the curtain at the Pavilion
Nov. 30 against Cal Poly rather than
against the customary alumni
j squad. They'll battle the old grads
instead on the Jol lowing evening,
I Dec. 1.
The complete 1951-52 schedule
lists a total of 21 contests, of which
13 are at home and three in the
Cow Palace. In addition. Burnett's
j pupils will tangle with the teams
j ol the Big Seven Conference in the
i latter's annual invitational tourna
ment at Kansas City, Mo., during
the Christmas holidays.
Stanford will be the only for
eign entry in this event, in which
Big Seven representatives Mis
souri. Nebraska. Colorado, Kan-

( sas. Kansas Sjtate. lowa State, and >
Oklahoma will take part. The In
dians meet Oklahoma Dec. 2(i in 1
i a first-round match.
The Kansas City tourney will
mark the squad's only intersectional ]
collegiate competition of the year. '
However, they host AAU runner- '
j up Phillips Oilers on Feb. 2.
The Stewart Chevvies, who edged
the Oilers in last year's AAU cham- j
j pionship finale, will be on hand for I
| their annual invasion of the Pavil- j
ion on Jan. 26.
As far as the Southern Division
race is concerned. Burnett's long
range prediction calls for a four
i team race with no outstanding fa- I
vorite appearing likely. UCLA, as j
; defending champ, will again be |
tough. But the Bruins will be ham- j
pered by the ineligibility of Dick j
; Ridgway, the 1951 scoring leader. 1
! for their first six conference games. '

808 BURNETT
—The new head coach
Fireballer Bobby Burnett, who took over the helm of Stanford's
basketball destinies in the wake of Everett Dean's sudden resig
nation last spring, paced 75 cagers through the year's initial work
out Monday afternoon.
The practices are continuing at the Pavilion daily at 4 p.m.

Foremost among the large turn
out, which included both freshman
and varsity candidates, were seven
lettermen from Dean's 1951 third
place club. These men—starters Ed
Tucker, Jim Ramstead. Jim Walsh,
and Bruce Iversen plus reserves

Gary Andrews, Paul Johnson, and
Bill Stevenson—will form the nu
cleus of a squad Burnett believes
to be a definite contender for the
1952 Southern Division flag.
Only Jumping Jack O'Sullivan.
'51 captain, has been lost from the
starting five.
One reason for Burnett's opti

mism is the standout group of
sophomores moving up from last
year's best - ever frosh (coached
liy one Bobby Burnett). Sky
j scrapers I)ave Epperson ((> ft. (J
I in.) and Don Carlson ((> ft. 4 in.)
and scrappy guard Oleg Su/.daletl
are almost sure bets for varsity
berths, as is (>-ft. 4-in. Kirk Pol
[ zine, another sophomore, who did
5 his firing as an All-Conference
pivotman with Modesto JC last
I season.
The Farm's prize prep catch, Fre
| mont's Ron Tomsic, will be avail-
I able for varsity work under the new
j conference frosh - eligibility ruling.
I Tomsic, now in his second quarter
;at Stanford, rated All-City honors
i three years running while at Fre
' mont.
The Card five will break a tradi
tion of long standing when they
raise the curtain at the Pavilion
Nov. 30 against Cal Poly rather than
against the customary alumni
j squad. They'll battle the old grads
instead on the Jol lowing evening,
I Dec. 1.
The complete 1951-52 schedule
lists a total of 21 contests, of which
13 are at home and three in the
Cow Palace. In addition. Burnett's
j pupils will tangle with the teams
j ol the Big Seven Conference in the
i latter's annual invitational tourna
ment at Kansas City, Mo., during
the Christmas holidays.
Stanford will be the only for
eign entry in this event, in which
Big Seven representatives Mis
souri. Nebraska. Colorado, Kan-

( sas. Kansas Sjtate. lowa State, and >
Oklahoma will take part. The In
dians meet Oklahoma Dec. 2(i in 1
