# Offense Stresses Passing As Defense Scrimmages
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Offensive emphasis was on passes yesterday as the Cards con
. tinued to prep for Saturday's looming struggle with Santa Clara.
Coach Chuck Taylor had guarterbacks Gary Kerkorian, Bob
Garrett, and Jack Bickel throwing first with the backs and ends
alone to polish the patterns. Then the offensive sguad lined up
and ran a short live passing scrim- I

| mage.
Meanwhile the defensive platoon
, was at the other end of the field
| yetting another stiff dose of Santa
j Clara plays run against them.
And well they might be work
ing against the Bronco plays, as
the latter were functioning very
effectively against Loyola last
I Sunday. The Broncos rolled for
i 158 yards 011 the ground and 223
| in the air against the Lions.
Per se this is not too significant,
but when the fact that two of the
passes thrown by QB Johnny Pasco
went 80 and 91 yards, respectively,
| for TD's is considered, it is seen
! that the Broncos can explode at any
i time for the whole distance.
In between Pasco's tosses fullback
Hank Burget kept the Loyola de

fense tightened up by 11 carries into
the line which netted him a big 111
yards and contributed much to the
Broncos' eventual 20-13 win.
Don't discount the Broncos' ef
forts last Sunday by saying they
were made against a second-rate
team. Santa Clara had previously
demonstrated it can damage the
style of the PCC's highest.
The Broncos scored 17 points
against UCLA, before they were lit
erally worn down by the 120-degree
heat of the Coliseum floor.
Against Washington State, which
only last week gave Cal a big scare
before losing 42 to 35, Santa Clara
managed three TD's before bowing
34 to 20.
On the injury front only two
new developments are evident.
From the much improved condi
tion of Marry Hugasian's bruised
hands, it is apparent he will play

some on Saturday. Bob Bryan
was suited up and running on his
injured knee yesterday, so if it
holds up he will also play Satur
day.


INDIANS BEWARE — Leading the Santa Clara attack Satur
day will be Mel "80-bo" Lewis, 165 pound halfback. Lewis,
a 20-year-old with one year of experience, is one of several fast
backs on the Bronco squad.

the line which netted him a big 111
yards and contributed much to the
Broncos' eventual 20-13 win.
Don't discount the Broncos' ef
forts last Sunday by saying they
were made against a second-rate
team. Santa Clara had previously
demonstrated it can damage the
style of the PCC's highest.
The Broncos scored 17 points
against UCLA, before they were lit
erally worn down by the 120-degree
heat of the Coliseum floor.
Against Washington State, which
only last week gave Cal a big scare
before losing 42 to 35, Santa Clara
managed three TD's before bowing
34 to 20.
On the injury front only two
new developments are evident.
From the much improved condi
tion of Marry Hugasian's bruised
hands, it is apparent he will play

some on Saturday. Bob Bryan
was suited up and running on his
injured knee yesterday, so if it
holds up he will also play Satur
day.


INDIANS BEWARE — Leading the Santa Clara attack Satur
day will be Mel "80-bo" Lewis, 165 pound halfback. Lewis,
a 20-year-old with one year of experience, is one of several fast
backs on the Bronco squad.

Offensive emphasis was on passes yesterday as the Cards con
. tinued to prep for Saturday's looming struggle with Santa Clara.
Coach Chuck Taylor had guarterbacks Gary Kerkorian, Bob
Garrett, and Jack Bickel throwing first with the backs and ends
alone to polish the patterns. Then the offensive sguad lined up
and ran a short live passing scrim- I

| mage.
Meanwhile the defensive platoon
, was at the other end of the field
| yetting another stiff dose of Santa
j Clara plays run against them.
And well they might be work
ing against the Bronco plays, as
the latter were functioning very
effectively against Loyola last
I Sunday. The Broncos rolled for
i 158 yards 011 the ground and 223
| in the air against the Lions.
Per se this is not too significant,
but when the fact that two of the
passes thrown by QB Johnny Pasco
went 80 and 91 yards, respectively,
| for TD's is considered, it is seen
! that the Broncos can explode at any
i time for the whole distance.
In between Pasco's tosses fullback
Hank Burget kept the Loyola de

fense tightened up by 11 carries into
the line which netted him a big 111
yards and contributed much to the
Broncos' eventual 20-13 win.
