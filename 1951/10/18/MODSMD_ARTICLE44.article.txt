# Sigma Chi Ties Stern
## 
### 
A pair of intercepted passes, one
for each team, led to the only
scores in the C to (J deadlock be
tween Stern IV and Sigma Chi 11.
A series of long runs by Gene
Shirley were stifled by an inter
cepted pass by the Sigs' John
Thome, and then the Sigma Chi's
threw a long pass which was in
tercepted by Conroe and returned
to the Sigma Chi eight-yard line.
From here it took Gene Shirley
only one play to snake the required
yardage to pay dirt. A pass into the
end zone failed and the score was
tied at 6 all.
Other scores were:
Kappa Sig 33, Fiji 0
El Cuadro 0. Biz Boys 20
V-20XA 12, Encina nfe 0
V-108 (). Encina 3W 37
Piii Kap 2G, Nu (I
Frosh Medics 13, SAE II 0
