# Cards Lead Bronc Series
## 
### 
The thirty-third meeting of the
j Indian and the Bronco will take
t place this Saturday on the Stanford
I turf, and as in most of their past
encounters, the Indian will be high
-1 ly favored to scalp his neighbor
from Santa Clara.
The Cards boast four straight vic
j tories, while the Bronco has eol-
I lected one winning decision and has
dropped three.
Predictions and past records mean
nothing when these two teams tan
gle. Although the Cards hold a
commanding lead in the series,
having won 20, lost 10, and tied two
since the inaugural contest back in
1914, a glance at recent contests
I shows what can happen.
In the past three years, under
j dog Bronco elevens have risen up
| to either defeat, tie, or scare highly
favored Card squads. In both '48
i and '49 it was Indian fumbles lead
i ing the way for the Santa Clarans,
and they took advantage of the
breaks for a 27-14 win and a 7-7 tie.
Just last year a weak Bronco
team gave another undefeated Red
i machine a tremendous scare before
i succumbing, 23-13. It was the run
! ning of Jack Kaplan that almost
i turned the tide for the Broncs.
| Kaplan will be back this year, and
! so will end Gern Nagler, All-Coast
I candidate, and pitchin' Johhny
Pasco.
