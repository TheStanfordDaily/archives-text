# Stanford Research Institute Solves Tough Radio Problem
## 
### 
Sinqe the lower frequency bands
which carry standard broadcast as
well as sky wave and short range
ground coverage have become so
overloaded, the Stanford Research
Institute has attempted a solution
to the problem. Institute engineers
have hit upon single-sideband trans
mission.
Single - sideband transmission is
not new. It has been in use for some
time in high-power, long distance,
and point-to-point communications.
What happened in the old method of
amplitude modulation was that the
signal varied from instant to in
stant in accordance with the modu
lation of the voice or signal being
sent, and the two resulting side
bands were wasted.
With the new method, however,
the high power carrier of the AM
is not generated, which results in

the saving of power; the- second
sideband is thus suppressed and that
section of the spectrum is now
available for u.se.
The reason that this new method
of transmission was delayed for so
long is that the problems of ex
pense, complexity of equipment,
1 and difficulty of operation and ad
justment had not been overcome.
It was about three years ago that
Professor O. G. Villard Jr. of Stan
ford brought the idea of single
band transmission to the attention
of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The
Signal Corps then commissioned the
Stanford Research Institute to per
fect the method for use in mobile
and portable applications.
In about a year the first trans
| mitter was finished and now the
j SRI engineers are working on a
I new model.
