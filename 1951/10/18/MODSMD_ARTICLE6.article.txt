## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt, Oct. 17 (UP)—The
British army seized almost complete
control of the Suez Canal Zone to
day and virtually isolated it from
the rest of Egypt as this nation mo
bilized all police and reserves and
sent 1,200 of them to the strife-torn
zone.
Britain was reinforcing its threat
ened 10,000-man garrison with 3,000
paratroopers, and a United Press
correspondent reported from Is
mail ia that "everyone here realizes
the Suez Canal area is now a Brit
ish-occupied zone."
Egyptian Minister of Interior
Fuad Serag El Din, in a dramatic
closing address to the Senate, said
British troops had occupied vir
tually all key posts the entire
length of the Suez Canal.
A dispatch from Ismailia said the
British seized the customs houses in
Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez at the
top, middle, and lower end of the
canal, occupied Ferdan Bridge,
Egypt's only link with the Sinai Pe
ninsula east of the canal, and were
operating military searches of trains
and buses.
Egypt called up its police reserves
and put the nation on a near emer
gency footing as Premier Mustapha
Nahas Pasha told parliament the
"time has come for action" in the
nation's efforts to oust the British
from Suez and the Anglo-Egyptian
Sudan.
The Minister of Interior, in his
closing speech, reviewed Wednes
day's rioting and said seven Egyp
tians were killed at Ismailia and
more than 4ft wounded, and five
killed and "many wounded" at
Pert Said. A boy also was killed
at Port Said, bringing the toll
there to six dead, he said.
Serag El Din charged the British
were responsible for the incidents
by their provocative attitude on the
day when they should have re
frained from appearing in cities "as
was their custom on previous occa
sions" when Egyptians were staging
national demonstrations.
"The British claimed they occu
pied the twin cities of Port Said
and Ismailia because of a shortage
of Egyptian police," he said. "This
claim is refuted by the fact that the
incidents occurred only because the
populace was provoked."

Egypt called up its police reserves
and put the nation on a near emer
gency footing as Premier Mustapha

The Minister of Interior, in his
closing speech, reviewed Wednes
day's rioting and said seven Egyp
tians were killed at Ismailia and
more than 4ft wounded, and five
killed and "many wounded" at
Pert Said. A boy also was killed
at Port Said, bringing the toll
there to six dead, he said.
Serag El Din charged the British
were responsible for the incidents
by their provocative attitude on the
day when they should have re
frained from appearing in cities "as
was their custom on previous occa
sions" when Egyptians were staging
national demonstrations.
"The British claimed they occu
pied the twin cities of Port Said
and Ismailia because of a shortage
of Egyptian police," he said. "This
claim is refuted by the fact that the
incidents occurred only because the
populace was provoked."
