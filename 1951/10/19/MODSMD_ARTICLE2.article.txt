WASHINGTON, Oct. IS (UP) â€”
A Senate subcommittee voted 3 to
2 today to reject the nomination of
Philip C. Jessup to be a United Na
tions delegate but Sen. Tom Con
nally apparently blocked any
chance of a full Senate vote on the
controversial appointment.
Connally refused to call a meet
ing of the full Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee to act on the
nomination before Congress' sched
uled adjournment Saturday. His
move loft the wav open for Presi
dent Truman to give Jessup a tem
porary appointment.
The Foreign Relations subcom
mittee unanimously approved nine
other UN nominees submitted by
President Truman, including Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Warren
R. Austin, chief U.S. delegate.
