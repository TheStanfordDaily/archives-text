# CARDS HOST UPSET-MINDED BRONCS
## Invaders' Attack Features Pasco's Arm, 'Pony' Backs 
### JIM MADISON 
While the attention of most Bay area football fans in focused
at Berkeley tomorrow afternoon, StanJord will play host to Santa
Clara's rough and ready Broncos in a traditional always filled with
more than its share of excitement. Kickoff time is 2 p.m.
Although the Golden Bear-Southern Cal titanic will have much

the more significance in the race for
the PCC title. Coach Chuck Taylor s
machinc will have at least throe ob
jectives important in their own right.
First and possibly foremost, the:
Cards must defeat the Broncos, a
task which is found upon inspection
to be of no little magnitude.
Coach Dick Gallagher of Santa
Clara possesses several formidable
steeds in his stable of football play
ers. He can put into the field an
attack platoon featuring the passing
of quarterback Johnny Pasco or
Duane Louis and tho fleet running
of a whole herd of pony backs.
Pasco's completion percentage
this year does not begin to compare
with Clary Kerkorian's, but the
Rronco QB lias proved definitely
explosive. Against I-ovola last week
two of his pass plays went for
scores from 80 and 111 yards out, re
spectively.
Of the backs, Hank Burgct 17f>
pound fullback; Jack Kaplan, 170
pounds of left half; and Joe McCar
ger, another 175 pounder who spells
Burget at full, have been the most
effective this year. Though small,
these lads are fast and tricky when
sprung loose, and like Pasco's pa.v" ;
they are capable of going all the way
without any advance notice.
Santa Clara's defensive line also
promises to wreak damage on the
Card cause. Last weekend they
rushed Loyola's famed Don Kloster■-
man to one of his poorest days thi .
year, a.she was able to complete
only 12 out of 30 tosses.
And it was much the same against
UCLA's Paul Cameron the week
before, until the torrid 120 degrees
heat on the Colliseum floor brought
them to a standstill in the second
half.
Added to the factual threat of the
i Bronco strength is the multi-uttered,
but nonetheless significant fact that,
year after year Santa Clara com"
up with its toughest., roughest game
of teh year when it tangles with the
ol' Indians in Stanford Stadium.
To overcome the last named con
sideration is the Cards second im
| portant objective Saturday. For
j the entire week before the San Jose
j game the coaching staff drummed
the line that the Spartans were a
i tough row to hoe. The Card foot
-1 bailers, however, sort of subcon
sciously considered the Spartans a
breather and subsequently were
hard put to defeat them.
The same problem has arisen again
i If Taylor and his staff succeed in
keeping the varsity's attitude on a
"play hard to win this one, then look
to the next" basis, then they will have
achieved the second objective.
The third goal will be to keep
