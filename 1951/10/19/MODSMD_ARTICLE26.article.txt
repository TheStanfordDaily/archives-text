# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
ALL IN A WEEK'S WASH
I was walking down the quad yesterday, when some
guy button - holed ine and said," Look - it, Growth,
three times a week. I open The Daily while I sip my
morning coffee, and what do I see? Your mu«!"

"The name's pronounced Gro
tay," I allowed.
' And frankly," he continued, "it
makes me sick to my stomach."
I stepped aside as he got sick,
and promised him that this Fri
day I wouldn't make him ill. And
so in case you've been wondering
why my countenance isn't count
enancing this morning, you now
know.

WHO'S SLEEPING IN MY BED DEPT. Jim Mona
chino, Gordy Soltau, and Verl Lilly white, three mem
bers of the San Francisco 49er professional football
team, were guests at the SAE house recently.
The three were thoroughly sacked out when one
of the brothers, who we'll call Jim, returned late at
night and found the well-muscled Lillywhite sleeping
in his bed. Jim, who wouldn't have to reduce too
much to reach 100 pounds, was somewhat perturbed
to find a stranger in his bunk.
"Who's sleeping in my bed," he queried, emulating
the baby bear in Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
"The name's Verl Lillywhite," was the sleepy answer.
"Yeah, sure, Lillywhite. and I must be Bill McColl,
then."
One word led to another, and both were getting
quite heated, when footballer Bobby Bryan came in
arid clued Jim that it really was Verl Lillywhite. Jim
reckoned that it would be downright inhospitable to
unbed a guest, especially since the visitor was some
what more brawny than he was, and he tip-toed
away, vowing never again to disturb the slumber of

a pro football player.
INSIDE KOBLE DEPT. One of the Roble sponsors
was reading the new liquor regulation to the girls in
her corridor.
"Gosh," squeaked one of the pink-cheeked frosh,
"I had a beer last Thursday! What'll I do?"
It's my unpleasant duty to inform that girl that she
can never hold a commission in the WACS.
SIGN ON A KOBLE DOOR ... Do Not Disturb,
Except When There Are Men Callers.

MATIIIAS SCORES FOR TIIE CARDINAL AND
RED. F rom what I hear, the sportscaster who an
nounced the Michigan-Stanford game was strictly
from hunger. Among the more prominent mistakes,
he kept referring to Stanford as the "cardinal and red,"
had Hugasian handing off to Kerkorian, and Mathias
scoring the second touchdown. The news that Mathias
had tallied the second touchdown would have been
interesting to Bob Meyers, who, at the time, had
about 800 pounds of Michigan tacklers crack into
him as he crossed the goal.

TRACKMAN GETS RELIGION. Karl Morgan
Block, Episcopal Bishop, is going to speak to the
Canterbury Club this Sunday night, which brings to
mind an incident that took place last year.
Martin Johnson, a member of the track team, settled
back to hear Bishop Block talk, but made a mental
memo to leave at a certain time in order to pick up
his girl for the Sunday Night Movies. Now, it's a
well-known fact that the Bishop is an after-dinner
speaker of the most engaging kind, and Johnson sat
there, spell-bound by it all. So spell-bound that he
completely forgot his date. The result was that hi*;
girl walked out on him.
Johnson's comment the next day: "Well, I lost my
girl, but I certainly got religion."
