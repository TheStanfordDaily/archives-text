## Embarrassment at the Sunday Night Movies 
### 
To the Editor:
Lesson one in eighth grade American history is that '
if we expect to be protected by the Bill of Rights we '
must keep from disturbing the rights of other people. !
We believe that freedom from embarrassment at Sun- i
day night movies should be included in the Stanford
Hill of Rights.
Yes. a sense of "moral decency" should keep the
balcony boys from yelling the things they do, but it
doesn't. Perhaps they should take a date to the movies.
One couple went to the movies two weeks ago and
though it wasn't a first date—they had been dating
since last spring—he was annoyed and embarrassed by
the remarks and she was afraid to look at him. They
haven't gone to the movies since. That's just one
example and there are many other couples who would
rather do something else than listen to comments
which should be reserved for unmixed company.
This isn't a threat that the Sunday movies will stop
if the remarks don't stop. It isn't an appeal to any
one's "mature sense of moral obligation." It's just that
we on the committee and our friends have gone to the
movies with members of the opposite sex and have
not liked what we've heard. We ask only that you,
"gentlemen of the balcony," try to put yourselves in
our places . . . and we think you'll stop short of the
remarks you've been making for the past three or
lour weeks and still be able to have a good time at
the Sunday evening movies.

P.S. We wish to thank Mssrs. Menaglia and Gross
for their "due respect" and wish to assure them that
the Fundamental Standard Committee has no objec
tions whatsoever to "a girl on the lield" if Rally Com
feels that it would add something to the football game
pageantry nor do we feel that for the girl cheerleaders
to wear loose skirts instead of tight ones would be
a violation of the Standard.
