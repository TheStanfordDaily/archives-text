# DU's Reply on Float
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In reply to the letter in yesterday's Daily which
alleged that we were fooled by "Cal Coeds" when we
gave them a bearhead and an Indian after the Hoat
parade on Friday, it may be well to point out a few
facts. Our float was displayed intact in front of the
D.U. House all day Saturday. The letter from the Cal
Coeds had no address, no names, or anything else to
substantiate their statement. It Is apparent then that
the letter was either a hoax or that the Cal gfals, with
typical alertness of mind, bungled the name of the
fraternity involved. Parts of our float did find their
way into feminine hands, however, because on Sun
day we gave the Indian to the Delta Gamma Sorority
sit San Jose State to improve Intercollegiate relations.

(Editor's note: A spokesman at the D.U. House
had "no comment" when informed of the contents
of the "Cal coed's" letter Wednesday night. He said
he was unable to locate the two who were supposed
to have given the float parts away.)
