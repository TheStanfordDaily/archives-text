# 'Kon-Tiki' Yarn Now Showing at Varsity
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"Kon-Tiki," as a book, has
headed non - fiction best - seller
lists for countless months. As a
movie, now at the Varsity, it has
done all right, too.
This remarkable popularity is not
without justification. "Kon-Tiki"' is

an exciting, real
1i 112 e adventure
yarn about an
expedition or -
ganized by Nor
wegian scientist
Thor Heyerdahl
to test his theory
that the Poly
nesian Islanders

sprang originally from South Amer
ica.
To prove the plausibility of this
theory, Heyerdahl and five compan
ions constructed a 40-foot raft of
balsa wood, following specifications
set clown by Peruvian natives al
most 2,000 years ago, and set sail.
With them the party took only the
barest essentials of modern naviga
tion.
As it turned out, even these es
sentials were unnecessary. Currents
and trade winds swept them along
their course in dramatic proof of
the Heyerdahl theory.
The movie consists of the fDot
age shot on a IG-mm. camera
which the adventurers took along
with them on the expedition.
Heyerdahl, complete with Scandi
navian accent, has dubbed in a
running commentary on the
events recorded.
The result is a fascinating docu
mentary of hair-raising adventure
which gains its force not through
acting, clever photography, or the
atrics, but through sheer dint of
hauling the audicnce right aboard
the raft to participate in the expe
dition. The effect is exciting and
refreshing, a pleasant relief from
the stilted hokum of studio-made
adventure epics.
'.'Kon-Tiki," in short, is a movie

not to he missed by those who
clamor for the unusual, the fresh,
the genuine in adventure film fare.

to test his theory
that the Poly
nesian Islanders

sprang originally from South Amer
ica.
To prove the plausibility of this
theory, Heyerdahl and five compan
ions constructed a 40-foot raft of
balsa wood, following specifications
set clown by Peruvian natives al
most 2,000 years ago, and set sail.
With them the party took only the
barest essentials of modern naviga
tion.
As it turned out, even these es
sentials were unnecessary. Currents
and trade winds swept them along
their course in dramatic proof of
the Heyerdahl theory.
The movie consists of the fDot
age shot on a IG-mm. camera
which the adventurers took along
with them on the expedition.
Heyerdahl, complete with Scandi
navian accent, has dubbed in a
running commentary on the
events recorded.
The result is a fascinating docu
mentary of hair-raising adventure
which gains its force not through
acting, clever photography, or the
atrics, but through sheer dint of
hauling the audicnce right aboard
the raft to participate in the expe
dition. The effect is exciting and
refreshing, a pleasant relief from
the stilted hokum of studio-made
adventure epics.
'.'Kon-Tiki," in short, is a movie

not to he missed by those who
clamor for the unusual, the fresh,
the genuine in adventure film fare.

Also showing and worth while:
"The Frogmen, - ' at the Cardi
nal, a story of the Navv's under
water demolition crew during
World War 11. in which a rather
hackneyed plot is overcome by
the excitement of the frogmen
(Richard Widmark, Dana An
drews) at work and some excel
lent underwater photography.
"Ace in the Hole" (also called
"The Big Carnival"), at the Palo
Alto Drive-in, Billy Wilder's adult,
cynical look at American manners
anJ morals as revealed through the
story of a heelish newsman (Kirk
Douglas) who keeps a man trapped
in an ancient Indian ruin to exploit
his publicity value. With Jan Ster
ling. Not for children or optimists.

"Kon-Tiki," as a book, has
headed non - fiction best - seller
lists for countless months. As a
movie, now at the Varsity, it has
done all right, too.
This remarkable popularity is not
without justification. "Kon-Tiki"' is
