Chuck Taylor is fast starting to build himself a reputation as a topflight
coach at Stanford, but it's doubtful if the USC's Trojans will ever be as
impressed with his coaching—no matter how many times the Indians beat
them under his tutorship—as they were by a play that he pulled in the
11)42 Card-Trojan game.
Troy was going to the Rose Bowl that year—so they thought—and they
had a back named Mickey McCardle who was being boomed for All-Coast
honors and was even considered as a possible All-American candidate.
Stanford was leading 7 to 6 when Charles Taylor lowered the boom on
Mickey McCardle.
Actually it took some help from Ilank Norherg too who tackled Mc-
Cardle just as he was crossing the line of scrimmage with ideas of going
places with the pigskin. The pigskin went places all right, hut poor Mc-
Cardle was left behind.
Guard Chuck Taylor stole the ball out of his arms, and. while McCardle
stood helpless in Norberg's bear hug, went over the goal line standing up
with the rest of the field still piled up at the line of scrimmage. The Mc-
Cardle to Taylor "reverse' made the score 14 to G. and the Trojans never did
recover after that. Madison's "Mad Mutterings" are nothing compared to
what Jeff Cravath's were for the rest of the 1942 season.
A similar steal has been recorded only one other time in the history of
the PCC.
Coaches Chuck Taylor, and George I.\ nn ought to feel well satisfied
with themselves in their campaign to teach Stanford's defenders the art
of backpcdaling. Of 73 passes attempted by the opposition this season,
only 2K have been completed, lor an average of 38 per cent. (Kcrkorian's
completion average is IM per cent).
In addition, in the Cards' last two games, UCLA and Michigan have
thrown a total of 35 passes, of which only 10. or 28 per cent have hit their
mark.
Contrast this to Stanford's swiss cheese pass defense of last year—and
others in the past—when the opposition completed 89 out of 196 passes—
average 45 per cent—lor the season. Average yards per game given up to
passes last season was 120 yards, so far this year it's 93 yards, second toughest
pass defense in the PCC.

of backpcdaling. Of 73 passes attempted by the opposition this season,
only 2K have been completed, lor an average of 38 per cent. (Kcrkorian's
completion average is IM per cent).
In addition, in the Cards' last two games, UCLA and Michigan have
thrown a total of 35 passes, of which only 10. or 28 per cent have hit their
mark.
Contrast this to Stanford's swiss cheese pass defense of last year—and
others in the past—when the opposition completed 89 out of 196 passes—
average 45 per cent—lor the season. Average yards per game given up to
passes last season was 120 yards, so far this year it's 93 yards, second toughest
pass defense in the PCC.
Chuck Taylor is fast starting to build himself a reputation as a topflight
coach at Stanford, but it's doubtful if the USC's Trojans will ever be as
impressed with his coaching—no matter how many times the Indians beat
them under his tutorship—as they were by a play that he pulled in the
11)42 Card-Trojan game.
Troy was going to the Rose Bowl that year—so they thought—and they
had a back named Mickey McCardle who was being boomed for All-Coast
honors and was even considered as a possible All-American candidate.
Stanford was leading 7 to 6 when Charles Taylor lowered the boom on
Mickey McCardle.
Actually it took some help from Ilank Norherg too who tackled Mc-
Cardle just as he was crossing the line of scrimmage with ideas of going
places with the pigskin. The pigskin went places all right, hut poor Mc-
Cardle was left behind.
Guard Chuck Taylor stole the ball out of his arms, and. while McCardle
stood helpless in Norberg's bear hug, went over the goal line standing up
with the rest of the field still piled up at the line of scrimmage. The Mc-
Cardle to Taylor "reverse' made the score 14 to G. and the Trojans never did
recover after that. Madison's "Mad Mutterings" are nothing compared to
what Jeff Cravath's were for the rest of the 1942 season.
A similar steal has been recorded only one other time in the history of
the PCC.
Coaches Chuck Taylor, and George I.\ nn ought to feel well satisfied
with themselves in their campaign to teach Stanford's defenders the art
of backpcdaling. Of 73 passes attempted by the opposition this season,
only 2K have been completed, lor an average of 38 per cent. (Kcrkorian's
completion average is IM per cent).
In addition, in the Cards' last two games, UCLA and Michigan have
thrown a total of 35 passes, of which only 10. or 28 per cent have hit their
mark.
Contrast this to Stanford's swiss cheese pass defense of last year—and
others in the past—when the opposition completed 89 out of 196 passes—
average 45 per cent—lor the season. Average yards per game given up to
