# USF-Stanford Soccer
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer squad, their unbeaten record spoiled by San Fran
cisco State last Wednesday night, will host USF tomorrow morning at
10 in an effort to halt the Dons' three-year, 30-game winning streak.
The Dons who boast wins over State and CCSF already this year,
will arrive on the Farm tomorrow morning confidently expecting another
victory to add to their long string.
Card Coach Russ Latham, however, believes that USF can be beaten
and the Indians have a good chance to do it on the morrow.


BRONCO BUSTERâ€”BiII McColl, Stanford's All-American wing
% man, enjoyed one of his greatest days against Santa Clara last
year. Here he is seen catching a pass over Marty Formico,
Bronco defender, for a touchdown. Stanford rooters are hoping
he can equal his performance tomorrow.
