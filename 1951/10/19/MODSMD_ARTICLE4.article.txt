# Oil Talks Collapse
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS. N.Y.—Brit
ain's hopes for United Nations pas
sage of its proposal for new Anglo-
Iranian oil talks collapsed today.
With the balloting scheduled for
tomorrow's Security Council meet
ing—which, incidentally, the Iran
ians will boycott—a sudden switch
in the voting line-up appeared to
have doomed the American-backed
British resolution.
The key switch wa.s understood
to have been made bv Yugoslavia,
which had been counted on to sup
ply the required seventh vote.
