# Cards-USC Water Poloists Battle
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated water polo
team will attempt to make it four
straight when they meet USC to
day at 3:30 p.m. in the Encina Pool.
The Trojans do not have their
usual powerhouse team this year
and Stanford's reserves may get a
good workout in today's fray.
Stan lord will probably open up

with their usual lineup of Bob Fro
jen, Jim Gaughram, and Bob Wyck
off at forwards, Mel Butler, Bert
Holiday, and Ash Jones at back, and
Rus.s La Telle in the goal. Frojen,
the Cards' and the PCC's leading
scorer, will continue his amazing
battle with the opposition. Thus
far he has outscored all Stanford's
opponents combined 15 to 11.
