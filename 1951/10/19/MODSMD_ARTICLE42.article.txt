Coach Bob Ghilotti's charges will
be without the services of tackles
Tom Romano and Jim Telegan,
guard Tom Romano, and linebacker
Manny all of whom
have moved up to the varsity. The
starting lineup, however, will be the
same as for last week's San Jose
game.
Santa Clara's two losses were to
the Cal Ramblers, 33 to (>. and to
Treasure Island, 7 to 0.
After this week's game the Braves
will have two weeks' rest before
meeting the USF JV's at Stanford
Stadium.
