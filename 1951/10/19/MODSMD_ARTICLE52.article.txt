# Mausoleum Site Planned For Leland Jr.'s Home
## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
The mausoleum, famed in
song and story around campus,
was built on a four - acre plot
originally chosen by Leland
Stanford Jr. as the site of his
, future home.
It was after Leland Jr.'s death
J that Senator and Mrs. Stanford dc
i cided to make it the final resting j
place for the family.
But Leland Jr. was not the first
one to be placed in the mausoleum,
j Senator Stanford died in June, 1893,
| a few days after its completion. Son ;
i joined father shortly afterward.
Jane Lathrop Stanford, third and j
j last member of the family, was [
placed in the tomb in 1905. She
died while on a trip to the Hawaiian i
1 Islands.
Designers of the mausoleum j
i were authorized to procure the j
finest materials and workman
ship available. Total cost of con- I
struction was $161,000. and that
was nearly f»0 years ago.
Built of gray, polished Vermont.
! granite, the tomb resembles a small
I Grecian temple in architectural de- j
I sign. Each stone that went into its i
j construction was cut to precise di- j
i mansions and shipped to California. |
I The smallest stone in the entire i
j structure weighs more than a ton. j
Each of the three sarcophagi
\ was hewn in Italy from a single
block of pure white marble. The
lids were separate and elaborate
ly carved.


REQUIESCANT IN PACE—On the land on which Leland Stan
ford at one time planned to build his home, he now rests for
ever. The mausoleum stands as a green haven in the arboretum
which the Stanford's loved most.
