Toyon Hall announces the en
gagement of Charles Crawford, '51,
to Lucy Gilson, Mills '51.

The entire interior of the mauso
leum is lined with Italian marble
eight inches thick. The walls on all
sides are 10 feet high, and the ceil
ing consists of a single arch of white
marble whose peak is 18 feet from
the floor with a span of 25 feet.
The mausoleum is closed by a
bronze gate at which fresh flowers
are always kept, and solid doors
of polished granite on which the
names are carved.
Four sphinxes, each carved out of
a single block of granite, stand
guard outside: two male figures in
front and two females in back.
And that's the background on one
of Stanford's most famous spots.
"She had never seen the mauso
leum.
Poor little Indian maid."
