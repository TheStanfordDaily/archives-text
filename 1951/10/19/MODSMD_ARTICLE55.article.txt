# SC Mascot Reappears
## 
### 
Tircbiter 11, the frisky canine
mascot of the University of South
j ern California, is back on the south-
I orn campus this morning afte a 12-
i day absence that sparked "inci
j dents" hetween angered Trojans
and students of UCLA.
The pesky little mutt disappeared
Oct. 5 from its SC doghouse and
many Southern Californians were
led to believe that the animal had
been "dognappod."
Tipped off that the dog had been
seen near Westwood Village in the
neighborhood of the UCLA campus,
USCers immediately rushed to the
| area and precipitated a brawl with
: UCLA's Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra
j ternity. An estimated $50 damage
j was inflicted on the fraternity house
: and several students were slightly
j injured in the fight.
Despite the battle, Tircbiter II
j was not found and the search con
j tinned. The sassy little terrier was
j finally found frisking along a coun
| try road outside Los Angeles. When
located the dog had a broken piece
jof rope dangling from its neck
! which, according to the Daily Tro
j jan, indicated that Tirebiter's ofT
| campus stay was a "forced ab
! sence."
