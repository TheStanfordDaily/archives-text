THE GO AHEAD TALLY—Bill McColl, with both feet off the
ground clutches a Bob Garrett pass to give Stanford a 13 to 6
lead over Santa Clara in the third period. Moments later Gary
Kerkorian added the extra point. After trying two unsuccess
ful line smashes, Garrett faking another, flipped a pass to Mc-

Coll alone in the end zone. Left end Bill Storum was also clear
in the opposite corner of paydirt. Bronco defenders, Marv
Gregory (84), Del Rasmussen (12) and Abe Dung (43) axe just a
bit too late.
