# New Kind Of 'Hell Week' For ATO Pledges
## 
### 
Twenty-one ATO pledges will
begin a new kind of "hell week" to
day with six days of constructive
labor at the Palo Alto YMCA, 657
Cowper Street.
The pledges will repaint the
building's eaves and trim, put up
110 feet of redwood fencing, and
clean and varnish hardwood floors
on the first floor.
House President George Kam
merer said the program is an effort
to channel "labor wasted on push
ups and the other usual 'hell week'
activities into effort that is con
structive and worth while."
Work at the "Y" should keep
pledges busy all week, according to
Pledge Master James Graham. Any
other activities will take place in
side the chapter house. Formal in
itiation of the pledges will be Sun
day afternoon.
Though the house needs work,
Kammerer thought the ATO pro
gram would improve relations with
the Palo Alto community.
Chief Counselor for Men Richard
L. Balch praised the ATO plan for
"substituting constructive scrvice
for dissipated energy." (See edito
rial, page 2.)
