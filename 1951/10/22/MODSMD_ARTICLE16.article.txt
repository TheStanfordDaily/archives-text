CARNIVAL CLOTHESâ€”Kappa Sig pledges costume up for Friday's Row Carnival, which was
deemed a financial success today by Marilyn Roth, general chairman, and her finance com
mittee. A gross total of 51,050 was taken in at the booths, auction, and street dancing. Profits
are estimated at S7OO, SlOO more than collected at last year's carnival. The profits will finance
a tuition scholarship for a gill now living on the Row. Applications for the Row scholarship go
through the ASSU Scholarship Committee. It was announced last week that Bambie Witherell,
a sophomore from Evanston, 111., who is now living at Roth House, is the recipient of this year's
Row Scholarship, raised from last year's carnival proceeds. A second $300 scholarship will be
awarded from last year's funds. Daily Photo by Herbert Smith
