# 21-14 VICTORY
## Breather Has Cards Gasping 
### JIM MADISON 
The Cards did it again against 1
Santa Clara's surprisingly rug-j
ged Broncos Saturday! In the
fifth straight game this season,;
Stanford's varsity footballers
fought their way out of a jam to
maintain their unbeaten record.
Santa Clara had astounded the j
20,000 fans attending by playing the
Cards to a virtual standstill and |
were driving for the potential win- !
ning touchdown, when Stanford
fired up for a final smash that won
the victory.
In the fourth quarter, after Bronco
fullback Hank Burget had broken
loose over his own left tackle, cut
back, and raced all the way to the
Stanford 17 before defensive end i
Jack Rye caught him from behind, >
the Card defense stopped the Santa '
Clara tide, and the offensive pla- ]
toon turned it.
Four Bronco Tries
On four tries for the winning
score, including an attempted field
goal, the Broncos were held to a !
minus 16 yards, and the Cards took
over for their final drive to pay dirt, j
With Gary Kerknrian, who had '
been out of the game for two and a
half periods after bring knocker!
cold in the opening quarter, run
ning and .'parking tbe .squad, the
Cards moved fi7 yards in nine plays
to score with little more than two
minutes left in the ball game.
Mathi as Drive
Fullback Bob Mathias, who ws* j
hitting really hard on Saturday,
started the drive by banking three
yards over right guard. Harry Hu
gasian hit left tackle and miracu
lously ftayed on his feet, long
enough to squeeze out a fn\>t down.
After this play, the Hipster, after
being banged about considerably
during the afternoon, left the game
seemingly exhausted, and Wes
Laubscher replaced him.
Laubscher immediately made
three; then Hon Cook, who ran wrll
all afternoon, spurted for 11. Cook
again went over center for two, and
the Broncs were penalized for de
laying the game.
Kerkorian hit MeColl, wbn made
an All-Ameriean catch as he ap
peared literally to pull the ball out
of Del Tia.-musson's attempt to
knock it down, for a first down on
the Bronco 21.
Cook went over right guard for
two. Then Mathias took a pitchout
around his own left end, but hack
behind blocks r»f Cook, Norm Ma
noogian, and Jim Viek, and stum
bled out of an attempted shoestring
tackle into the end zone for the
core. Kerkorian converted, and
the game was as good as over.
Ciood Start
The Cards had started out as
though they were really going to
put on a display of football, as they
took the opening kiekofT and ground
7!1 yards in Ifi plays to put their
first TD on the scoreboard with only
I seven minutes gone in the first
! quarter.

Mathias went over right tackle for
the last four yards, hitting three
Santa Clara tacklers with a crack
that could be heard in the press box
and carrying them with him into
the end zone. Kerkorian made the |
first of his three conversions.
But the Broncs did not fold. Af
ter a second Card drive stalled on j
the Santa Clara 37 and Dick Horn
punted nicely out of hounds on th*; '
eight, the invaders played the In- i
dians evenly until well into the sec- j
ond quarter.
Bur get Sparks Move
At this point from their own 46.
with fullback Hank Burget doing |
most of the damage, the Broncs j
moved to Stanford's end zone in 13 j
plays.
Time and again Burget and halfs j
Jack Kaplan and Del Rasmussen i
took the left side of the Card de- 1
fensive line apart, as QB Pasco j
tossed only one pass, complete to j
right end Dick Wiborn, for 15 yards, j
Burget bucked over from the one
to cross, and Jack Daly converted.
Stanford opened up the second
half iust like it began the ball game,«
marching 56 yards in an 11-play
drive that was climaxed when QB
Bob Garrett crossed up a nine-man j
Bronco defensive line bv throwing j
♦o Bill McColl in the right flat for
the score. Kerkorian came in to
convert.
Broncos Mold
But again Santa Clara refused to
fold, and the Broncs took Chuck
Hokanson's following kickofT back
from their own 20 to tic up the
game, despite two bad breaks which
hampered the march. One of these
was a Pasco pass on which the refs
ruled Wiborn barely out of hounds
as he caught it. The second was 15
for illegal use of hands.
Right half Me! Lewis slanted off
left tackle from nine yards out to
score the tying touchdown. Daly
again converted.
But it war. Kerkorian's return
'hat gave a tremendous lift to the
Card rooters and apparently fur
nished the necessary drive to the
team also. For the next time the
Card oflense got its hands on the
ball, it drove to the winning score.
