# Make ATO Plan the Stanford Plan
## 
### 
All 24 of Stanford's fraternities should give
sincere thanks to the ATO's this morning for
the most constructive idea that has come from
the Row in many a year.
The ATO pledges will head for Palo Alto
today to start a six day work program at the
Paly YMCA. The pledges will do an extensive
job of cleaning, painting and general handy
man work.
Noxmally these same pledges would be sub
ject to a Hell Week consisting of water bags,
lawn fights, perhaps a little "illicit" paddling
and a lot of general nonsense supposedly test
ing new men but actually wasting a lot of time.
That's the normal way but not the ATO
way. Instead of wasted time for house mem
bers it will be time well spent in helping
others. In short, the ATO's are changing
Hell Week to Help Week. We think it's a
great idea.
For one thing, this type of constructive work
will raise the public's estimation of fraternities
a notch. Thus it's a good job of public rela
tions and there are scarcely any other organi
zations short of the Communist Party USA that
need good public relations more than frater
nities in general.
Fraternities are often in a bad position with
the public because of stupid and sometimes
dangerous pranks. Newspapers always print
this type of story, and rightfully so. But the

ATO plan is the type of thing that will be
printed by papers, too, and it's the type of plan
that will prove fraternity men can sometimes
be quite useful.
Certainly the ATO plan will help our re
lationship with Palo Alto. This is an impor
tant factor. University students are some
times hard for townspeople to understand,
but this project is the type of thing everyone [
can understand—and appreciate.
The ATO plan should help the fraternities
themselves, and certainly won't hinder them.
Any prospective pledge who would dodge a
certain house because Hell Week meant a little
labor wouldn't be worth the trouble of rushing.
Actually a lot of fraternity men will tell you
they wish this sort of plan had been in opera
tion when they were forced to go through the
childish Hell Week.
The ATO plan will help Stanford, too. But
there is one way that it could help the Uni
versity even more. That would result if the
ATO plan became the Stanford plan.
If all 24 fraternities had Help Week instead
of Hell Week the good results would be un
limited. Stanford and the fraternities would
gain thousands of new friends. Interfraternity
Council and the individual houses should make
plans right now to follow the lead of the ATO's.
Nothing except the senseless tradition of Hell
Week stupidity stands in the way.

and a lot of general nonsense supposedly test
ing new men but actually wasting a lot of time.
That's the normal way but not the ATO
way. Instead of wasted time for house mem
bers it will be time well spent in helping
others. In short, the ATO's are changing
Hell Week to Help Week. We think it's a
great idea.
For one thing, this type of constructive work
will raise the public's estimation of fraternities
a notch. Thus it's a good job of public rela
tions and there are scarcely any other organi
zations short of the Communist Party USA that
need good public relations more than frater
nities in general.
Fraternities are often in a bad position with
the public because of stupid and sometimes
dangerous pranks. Newspapers always print
this type of story, and rightfully so. But the

ATO plan is the type of thing that will be
printed by papers, too, and it's the type of plan
that will prove fraternity men can sometimes
be quite useful.
Certainly the ATO plan will help our re
lationship with Palo Alto. This is an impor
tant factor. University students are some
times hard for townspeople to understand,
but this project is the type of thing everyone [
can understand—and appreciate.
The ATO plan should help the fraternities
themselves, and certainly won't hinder them.
Any prospective pledge who would dodge a
certain house because Hell Week meant a little
labor wouldn't be worth the trouble of rushing.
Actually a lot of fraternity men will tell you
they wish this sort of plan had been in opera
tion when they were forced to go through the
childish Hell Week.
The ATO plan will help Stanford, too. But
there is one way that it could help the Uni
versity even more. That would result if the
ATO plan became the Stanford plan.
If all 24 fraternities had Help Week instead
of Hell Week the good results would be un
limited. Stanford and the fraternities would
gain thousands of new friends. Interfraternity
Council and the individual houses should make
plans right now to follow the lead of the ATO's.
Nothing except the senseless tradition of Hell
Week stupidity stands in the way.
All 24 of Stanford's fraternities should give
sincere thanks to the ATO's this morning for
the most constructive idea that has come from
the Row in many a year.
The ATO pledges will head for Palo Alto
today to start a six day work program at the
Paly YMCA. The pledges will do an extensive
job of cleaning, painting and general handy
man work.
Noxmally these same pledges would be sub
ject to a Hell Week consisting of water bags,
lawn fights, perhaps a little "illicit" paddling
and a lot of general nonsense supposedly test
ing new men but actually wasting a lot of time.
