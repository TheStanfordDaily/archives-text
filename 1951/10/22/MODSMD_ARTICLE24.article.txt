# BULL SESSION

### DICK McLEAN 
BOTH BARRELS
This Bull Session won't be funny. It's not meant
to be. This one is dead serious to you, to me and our
Stanford. It's about the foreign language require
ment.
It is my contention that it must be changed. I am
not after languages in general nor the departmental
language curricula. I am opposed to the present uni
versity lower division language requirement.
Here is my case:
1) The students at large do not want it as it now
exists. Lower division students often realize later that
requirements eventually prove valuable. This is true
in Western Civilization. But in the case of the lan-

guage requirement (as it now ex
ists) the seniors and even the
graduate students will say in
resume of their college careers
that the price was far too high
for the benefits. If I am correct
in the above judgment, that should
be indictment enough.
2) Though this requirement
was originally designed to foster
liberal education, it now works
to an opposite end. Liberal edu-

cation is made to "round out the person, lint cer
tainly there arc better means of producing respon
sible, thinking, cultured adults than 21 units of
idioms, vocabulary, and four novels of doubtful
literary or philosophical merit.
While thinking in terms of liberal education, weigh
the value of 21 units of poli sci, literature, and hu
manities against what you've gotten and what you're
fretting in your language courses. Weigh them care
fully and read the scale. What does it look like to you?
Or look at the time spent in language (as it is now
taught) in another light. It must be remembered that
the four years of college are full years. When you
graduate as a senior, you'll find that there just wasn't
enough time to take all the subjects that you wanted.
Electives are valuable simply because they are just

that—courses that you yourself wanted to take. The
like is true of greater concentration in your major
field of interest.

And to the detriment of these the present foreign
language requirement works.
:i) The various language departments would bene
fit from a change in the rule because then the classes
would he filled with those who honestly wanted to be
there. A new spirit of enthusiasm and interest enter
the rooms and the curriculum could be greatly speeded.
This would be more fair to those who so wished to
major in a language or for that matter, those who
cared.
That unhappy pattern could be broken. That pattern
which is so typical—the student coming to Stanford ;
with a little high school background, beginning all
over in some language, losing all interest, and "hang
ing on the ropes" for a couple of quarters hoping for j
a "C-."
The evil of those, who deliberately flunk a place- t
ment test to go into a class beneath their ability and
thus blast the curve out of sight for the genuine !
beginners, would come to an end. Nothing breaks a '
person's spirits faster than writing a good test only !
to be run down by a "souped up'' curve.
I ask throughout this entire discussion that you do
three things. First, look at the whole problem as real
ists—look at present conditions as they are, not as they
should be on paper. Secondly, reserve your judgment
until I have presented the whole case. It is too vast
a subject for one Bull Session. It will take three.
Thirdly, if you believe in what I say, do something.
This is a big issue and one which is nov/ under dis
cussion within the faculty. If you will make your will
known, one way or another, this whole issue can and
will be solved. This is a Stanford problem, one which i
has been a source of great concern for many years, j
We, the students, can aid and speed this decision if i
we care. If we care about our Stanford.
Tomorrow's Bull Session will be entitled "The Solu- I
tion" and on Wednesday" "The Course of Action."
