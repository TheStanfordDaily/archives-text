Sen. Robert A. Taft's formal declaration of candi
dacy for the Republican presidential nomination last
week gave further impetus to the mounting specula
tion as to who will bear the GOP standard into the
1952 political fray.
Will it be Taft or Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower;
Harold E. Stassen or California's Gov. Earl Warren;
or one of the GOP's less famous political aspirants?
With these questions in mind. The Daily interviewed
Professor Thomas S. Barclay of the Department of
Political Science for an informed analysis of the situ
ation.
Professor Barclay's academic qualifications for the
job are further enhanced by his practical experience
in the field of politics. He has been a delegate or al
ternate to three Democratic National Conventions,
a presidential elector, and for twenty years a mem
ber of county and state Democratic committees.
When asked "What do you think of Taft's declaration
of candidacy," Professor Barclay stated:
"By many of the established canons of American
politics. Sen. Taft fully deserves the Republican nomi
nation in 1952. He is an able lawyer, an experienced
legislator, a successful campaigner coming from a
highly important but politically unpredictable state,
and he comes from a family long prominent in Ameri
can life."
"The Senator is a politicians' politician. By this I
mean he has an alert and well linn need pre-convention

organization.
In response to a question as to the likelihood of
Eisenhower entering the race for the GOB nomina
tion Barclay was non-committal. He did say, how
ever, that Taft's quest for instructed delegates will
force the general's supporters to secure a decision
from him.
What did Barclay think might be the outcome of
;i battle between Eisenhower and Taft. should that
situation develop?
"The nature of American governmental arrange
ments results usually in nomination of an 'available'
candidate, and availability seems more important than
ability. Sen. Taft has both assets."
Both Harold E. Stassen and Gov. Earl Warren were
classified as "dark horse candidates in the political
stable" by Professor Barclay. In reply to a direct
question from the Daily reporter he also included
Sen. Leverett Saltonstall as another dark horse can
didate.
Recognizing Barclay's affiliation with the Demo
cratic party, The Daily asked for a comment on that
party's plans for reelection.
"Democratic politicians, no matter what faction
they belong to. believe that Truman . . ." and here
he paired, "Would you say 'can' or 'could' defeat
Taft in '52?" he asked the reporter.
"The wort! 'can' implies that Truman definitely i:
the Democratic candidate," replied the reporter.'
"Democratic politicians" said Barclay, "believe thai
Truman 'could' defeat Taft in 1052."
