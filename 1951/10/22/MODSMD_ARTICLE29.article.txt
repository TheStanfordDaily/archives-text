# 'Trojan' Pans Late Profs

### 
"Punctuality is a virtue which many of our professors espouse
but do not practice."
At least, so the USC DAILY TROJ.AN feels, as it recently edi
torialized on "Punctual Professors." In last Thursday's TROJAN,
editorial writer "T.D." blasted those hypocritical professors who

reprimand students' frailties in
promptness while disregarding their
own.
The editorial cited various cases
of thoughtlessness on the part of
; tome professors which contribute to
students' lateness. Mainly tne i ro
jan aimed its blast at those profs
who do not dismiss their classes on
time.
Said the paper, "Most of us have
encountered professors wh > insist
that their student be en time -and
rightly so. . . . This sounds fair
enough. If most students are able
i to get to class 10 minutes after
j a previous class,, all presumably
should be able to do so. But there's
a catch â€”not all students have 10
minutes."
Citing various examples of pro
fessorial use of overtime, the Tro
jan makes its case while explaining,
"This is not a plea lor the student
who doesn't care if he ever makes
it to class or not. It is a request
that professors consider all factors
that contribute to tardiness. The
student is not always to blame.
"Let him who has not. kept a class
overtime mark the first 'absent'."
