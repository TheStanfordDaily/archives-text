# 'Poor Game'-Taylor; Rice, Southwood Out
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
It wasn't a win worth celebration. It was just another job done,
or so thought the Indians after the Santa Clara triumph.
The usual dressing room hilarity following a victory was re
placed by a team discouraged with their showing, v/ith the grow
ing list of injuries, and most of all with the USC win over Cali-

fornia. r l .ie gridders had waited the
Bears to remove the El Troy ob
stacle on toe Rose Bow! road.
Kite, Southwood Out
The bad news is that Gordy Rice
i , out for the season with a broken
ley '.nd Eric Southwood will miss
the Washington game with a twht
ed knee. However, it could have ;
been worse. Gary Kerkorian threw j
a scare into everyone in the open- j
ing quarter when in a pile-up he |
got knocked goofy and suffered a |
loss of memory which carried into |
the fourth period when his head
cleared. His return to action
i parked the Indians to the winning
tally, and drew a collective sigh of 1
relief from Stanford followers.
After it was all over Kerkorian
said he had no recollection of
throwing an intercepted pass, or of
what plays bo was calling before his
injury was discovered and he was
taken out.
Just a Bad Game
Chuck Taylor was a bit down
cast but had expected a hard game.
However, he had hoped for a better |
game by his men. Chuck thought I
show by his men. Chuck thought !
that all the way around the game
was not a good job. He blamed him
from the bench was poor."
Taylor had words of praise for !
the Broncos and especially liked the |
spirit they showed in coming back
after Stanford had taken an early
lead.
The youthful mentor, who is yet I
to lose a game while coaching a I
Stanford team, said, "Santa Clara's
ba ic plays hurt us. Our defense I
was sc I primarily against passes and j
they looled us with straight hand
oil's. When we sent in our line
backers they started passing. They
had us guessing. The loss of Jesse
Cone hurt us plenty."
Taylor singled out the pass
cntching of Bill McColl, Ron Eadie's
defensive play, and the running of

Ron Cook, Wes Laubscher, and Bob
Mathias, as standout factors in the
win.
Coach Dick Gallagher had only
Draise for his boys. He thought that
if Hank Burget had been in good
shape Jack Rye would not have
caught him on the Stanford 17 after
a 47-yard breakaway.
The ex - assistant coach of the
Cleveland Browns said that the
Stanford-Santa Clara games were
always good, hard - hitting games,
and added, "We played the same
brand of ball today as we did
against Washington and California,
but today we didn't get as many
bad breaks."
Santa Clara's head man thought
the Card line blocked viciously and
the work of Jim Vick and Norm
Manoogian was outstanding. He
added, "Mathias runs hard, doesn't
he? Oh, and that McColl, he is a
real All - American. Bill always
hurts you when and where it hurts
most." Santa Clara had no serious
injuries.

injuries.
It wasn't a win worth celebration. It was just another job done,
or so thought the Indians after the Santa Clara triumph.
The usual dressing room hilarity following a victory was re
placed by a team discouraged with their showing, v/ith the grow
ing list of injuries, and most of all with the USC win over Cali-

fornia. r l .ie gridders had waited the
Bears to remove the El Troy ob
stacle on toe Rose Bow! road.
Kite, Southwood Out
The bad news is that Gordy Rice
i , out for the season with a broken
ley '.nd Eric Southwood will miss
the Washington game with a twht
ed knee. However, it could have ;
been worse. Gary Kerkorian threw j
a scare into everyone in the open- j
ing quarter when in a pile-up he |
got knocked goofy and suffered a |
loss of memory which carried into |
the fourth period when his head
cleared. His return to action
i parked the Indians to the winning
tally, and drew a collective sigh of 1
relief from Stanford followers.
After it was all over Kerkorian
said he had no recollection of
throwing an intercepted pass, or of
what plays bo was calling before his
injury was discovered and he was
taken out.
Just a Bad Game
Chuck Taylor was a bit down
cast but had expected a hard game.
However, he had hoped for a better |
game by his men. Chuck thought I
show by his men. Chuck thought !
that all the way around the game
was not a good job. He blamed him
from the bench was poor."
Taylor had words of praise for !
the Broncos and especially liked the |
spirit they showed in coming back
after Stanford had taken an early
lead.
The youthful mentor, who is yet I
to lose a game while coaching a I
Stanford team, said, "Santa Clara's
ba ic plays hurt us. Our defense I
was sc I primarily against passes and j
they looled us with straight hand
oil's. When we sent in our line
backers they started passing. They
had us guessing. The loss of Jesse
Cone hurt us plenty."
Taylor singled out the pass
cntching of Bill McColl, Ron Eadie's
defensive play, and the running of

Ron Cook, Wes Laubscher, and Bob
Mathias, as standout factors in the
win.
Coach Dick Gallagher had only
Draise for his boys. He thought that
if Hank Burget had been in good
shape Jack Rye would not have
caught him on the Stanford 17 after
a 47-yard breakaway.
The ex - assistant coach of the
Cleveland Browns said that the
Stanford-Santa Clara games were
always good, hard - hitting games,
and added, "We played the same
brand of ball today as we did
against Washington and California,
but today we didn't get as many
bad breaks."
Santa Clara's head man thought
the Card line blocked viciously and
the work of Jim Vick and Norm
Manoogian was outstanding. He
added, "Mathias runs hard, doesn't
he? Oh, and that McColl, he is a
real All - American. Bill always
hurts you when and where it hurts
most." Santa Clara had no serious
injuries.
