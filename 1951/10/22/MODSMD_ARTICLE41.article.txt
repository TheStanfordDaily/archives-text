# WATER POLO
## Two More Victories 
### 
Bobby Frojen and the Stanford
water pulo team continued their \
torrid pace with weekend victories j
over USC and Fullerton JC.
On Friday, the Cards waltzed to j
an easy 7 to 1 win over the Tro
jans. Stanford put on an impres
sive di-pluy of power in the first
half as they dumped in six goals to
USC's none. Frojen scored three,
Bob Wyckofl two, and a USC man
the other one. In the second half
the Trojans scored a lucky goal
and Jim Gaughram countered with
a marker for the Cards. Stanford's
defense was outstanding through
out the contest, and in the third
quarter USC was unable to take a
shot at the goal.
The Fullerton tilt on Saturday
was surprisingly tough. Frojen was
held scoreless for three periods and
Fullerton was ahead three to one j
when Frojen suddenly exploded for
four goals to give the Indians a 6
to 3 win. Gaughram and WyckofT
tallied the other two. Frojen has
now scored 22 goals in five contests.
