# Britain Vote to Decide: Left or Right?
## Profs Predict Tight Contest Conservatives Are 'Radical' 
### DAVID WONG 
Haunted by the spectre of a
cold and hungry winter at home
and a critical and uncertain situ
ation abroad, Britons will go to
the polls Thursday to choose a
new government. But regardless
I of the outcome, they can expect
little change in their domestic
policies or in their foreign rela
tions.
That was the opinion of two ex
perts in Britjsh affairs, Dr. Carl F.
Braf>d, Professor of History, and Dr.
Philip W. Buck, Professor of Political
Science. In two separate interviews,
the Stanford professors analyzed the
British election scene and answered
specific questions as to what a labor
or a Conservative victory would
mean.
Uneasy About Churchill
| A.s to predictions of the outcome of
| the elections, Dr. Buck said his hunch
J is that the Laborites will win with a
\ slightly increased majority than they
now hold. He based hLs belief on
! that fact that the Conservatives suf
j fer from the overwhelming predomi
nance of Churchill and that the Con
: servative and Labor programs are
very much the same.
He said that many people in Eng

land are feeling uneasy about putting
Churchill in power at a difficult time
like the present, because Churchill
is too impulsive and too willing to
take risks. During the war period
such qualities might be assets, but
now people arc not willing to take
"frightful chances."
Status Quo Preferred
Since Conservative and Labor plat
forms are so much alike, people are
more inclined to leave affairs in the
hands of the people who have been
running things rather than to place
them in the hands of inexperienced
Conservatives.
Furthermore, about 85 percent of
the electorate voted in 1!S50, and since
there is unlikely to be any great in
crease in the number of voters, the
same people would probably vote in
very much the same way. However,
Dr. Buck admitted 'hat the elections
can very well go the other way as it
is a close affair.
Conservative Trends
Dr. Brand made no predictions as
to the results. Instead he pointed to
statistics, and said that the current
trend of opinion favored the Con
servatives. Six weeks ago, according
to the Gallup Poll, the Conservatives
were favored by 11 points. Since
then, however, the lead has narrowed
down to six.
Dr. Brand pointed out that the
Labor Party has made history in that
they have not lost a single seat in
a by-election since 1945. Further
more, in 1950, the Labaritcs succeed
ed in overcoming a 10-point lead to
win the elections.
Attlcc, The Personality
In polls of personality, Attlee stood
out far ahead of his Conservative ri
vals as the most desirable prime
minister. Eden came in second while
Churchill came in third. In a sub
sidiary question—"Which Party will
help you most?"— Labor received a
five-point lead.
Both Dr. Brand and Dr. Buck
pointed out that even if the Conserv
atives came into power, that would
not mean a repudiation of what La
bor had done and what Labor stood

for. A Conservative victory would
mean no further nationalization, but
in the main, the same domestic poli
cies would be followed.
No Major Changes
The two professors also agreed
about the future of the welfare state
in case of a Conservative victory.
They said there would be no major
chances, for the Conservatives were
just as socialistic in disposition as the
Laborites, although few Americans
understood thaf fact.
British Conservatives, in the opinion j
of Dr. Brand, are actually further |
left than American New Dealers. |
Dr. Brand also said the National >
Health program has the overwhelm- i
ing support of the masses, and all !
that the Conservatives can do i.s to j
promise better administration and !
better deals for the doctors. Housing j
projects have been another impor- j
♦ ant item in election .speeches on both
sides. While the Laborites promised
200,000 new houses, the Conservatives
promised 300.000.
Foreign Policy
In the field of foreign policy, Dr. j
Buck said the Conservatives are i
likely to conduct a more aggressive |
policy if they come into power. While !
the people realize that the situation !
in the Near East is worse, they do j
not blame it on the Laborites. They ]
will probably think that the Laborites ;
will take less chances if they handled i
the situation.
Both parties are pledged to rearm
ament, and they will rearm as much ;
as possible. However, Dr. Buck said I
Great Britain is very hard pressed
economically, and the United States
should remember that fact.
An Unexpected Issue
Dr. Brand said that foreign affairs '
was not originally an issue in the j
campaign. But since the issue of the
party manifestos, things in Iran,
Iraq, and Egypt came to a head. For
eign affairs thus becomc a serious
and unexpected issue.
The Laborites have accuse d
Churchill of being a warmonger, but j
Dr. Brand said that he thought the j
accusation was not a fair one. "No

responsible British statesman can he
a warmonger. The British economy
is dependent upon a peaceful world.
Th"ir economy is in a precarious po
sition and they know it," Dr. Brand
said.
Rearmament Injurious
Continuing, he said the rate of re
armament has sent the British econ
omy into a tailspin. Whereas four
months ago the government came
close to balancing the budget, now
there is a deficit of $600,000,000. At
the present rate, Britain would he
bankrupt in 18 months.
For that reason a great deal of at
tention has been paid to Aneurin
Bevan, who is one of the most for
midable figures in British politics and
Churchill's only rival on the plat
form. The cleavage in the Labor
Party is not based only on the fact
that Bevan wants a bigger dose of
socialism, but also on Bevan's attitude
towards rearmament.
Bevan Sees Danger
The m-cvailing opinion is that Bev
an is anti - American, pro-Russian,
and opposed to rearmament. Actu
ally, Dr. Brand said, Bevan thinks
there is danger and there is need for
rearmament. His only difference i.s
the degree of rearmament.
Last summer, the Bevan p roup pre
dicted that if Britain went all out. .she
would strain her economy end thus
destroy the object of rearmament.
Britain did try too hard and as a re
sult her economy broke down, and
now Britons are faced with the pros
pects of less food and less coal for
the coming winter. Bevan's pre
dictions have thus been fulfilled.
Dr. Brand said that Bevan'.s point
of view i.s something which demands
more careful consideration in this
country and in Britain. For the sake
of party unity, Bevan has not made
an open break with the rest of Labor.
However, the problem will have to
be faced squarely after the elections.

Both Dr. Brand and Dr. Buck
pointed out that even if the Conserv
atives came into power, that would
not mean a repudiation of what La
bor had done and what Labor stood

for. A Conservative victory would
mean no further nationalization, but
in the main, the same domestic poli
cies would be followed.
No Major Changes
The two professors also agreed
about the future of the welfare state
in case of a Conservative victory.
They said there would be no major
chances, for the Conservatives were
just as socialistic in disposition as the
Laborites, although few Americans
understood thaf fact.
British Conservatives, in the opinion j
of Dr. Brand, are actually further |
left than American New Dealers. |
Dr. Brand also said the National >
Health program has the overwhelm- i
ing support of the masses, and all !
that the Conservatives can do i.s to j
promise better administration and !
better deals for the doctors. Housing j
projects have been another impor- j
♦ ant item in election .speeches on both
sides. While the Laborites promised
200,000 new houses, the Conservatives
promised 300.000.
Foreign Policy
In the field of foreign policy, Dr. j
Buck said the Conservatives are i
likely to conduct a more aggressive |
policy if they come into power. While !
the people realize that the situation !
in the Near East is worse, they do j
not blame it on the Laborites. They ]
will probably think that the Laborites ;
will take less chances if they handled i
the situation.
Both parties are pledged to rearm
ament, and they will rearm as much ;
as possible. However, Dr. Buck said I
Great Britain is very hard pressed
economically, and the United States
should remember that fact.
An Unexpected Issue
Dr. Brand said that foreign affairs '
was not originally an issue in the j
campaign. But since the issue of the
party manifestos, things in Iran,
Iraq, and Egypt came to a head. For
eign affairs thus becomc a serious
and unexpected issue.
The Laborites have accuse d
Churchill of being a warmonger, but j
Dr. Brand said that he thought the j
accusation was not a fair one. "No

responsible British statesman can he
a warmonger. The British economy
is dependent upon a peaceful world.
Th"ir economy is in a precarious po
sition and they know it," Dr. Brand
said.
Rearmament Injurious
Continuing, he said the rate of re
armament has sent the British econ
omy into a tailspin. Whereas four
months ago the government came
close to balancing the budget, now
there is a deficit of $600,000,000. At
the present rate, Britain would he
bankrupt in 18 months.
For that reason a great deal of at
tention has been paid to Aneurin
Bevan, who is one of the most for
midable figures in British politics and
Churchill's only rival on the plat
form. The cleavage in the Labor
Party is not based only on the fact
that Bevan wants a bigger dose of
socialism, but also on Bevan's attitude
towards rearmament.
Bevan Sees Danger
The m-cvailing opinion is that Bev
an is anti - American, pro-Russian,
and opposed to rearmament. Actu
ally, Dr. Brand said, Bevan thinks
there is danger and there is need for
rearmament. His only difference i.s
the degree of rearmament.
Last summer, the Bevan p roup pre
dicted that if Britain went all out. .she
would strain her economy end thus
destroy the object of rearmament.
Britain did try too hard and as a re
sult her economy broke down, and
now Britons are faced with the pros
pects of less food and less coal for
the coming winter. Bevan's pre
dictions have thus been fulfilled.
Dr. Brand said that Bevan'.s point
of view i.s something which demands
more careful consideration in this
country and in Britain. For the sake
of party unity, Bevan has not made
an open break with the rest of Labor.
However, the problem will have to
be faced squarely after the elections.

DJJ PHILIP \V BUCK
—"Victory for Labor"
Haunted by the spectre of a
cold and hungry winter at home
and a critical and uncertain situ
ation abroad, Britons will go to
the polls Thursday to choose a
new government. But regardless
I of the outcome, they can expect
little change in their domestic
policies or in their foreign rela
tions.
That was the opinion of two ex
perts in Britjsh affairs, Dr. Carl F.
Braf>d, Professor of History, and Dr.
Philip W. Buck, Professor of Political
Science. In two separate interviews,
the Stanford professors analyzed the
British election scene and answered
specific questions as to what a labor
or a Conservative victory would
mean.
Uneasy About Churchill
| A.s to predictions of the outcome of
| the elections, Dr. Buck said his hunch
J is that the Laborites will win with a
\ slightly increased majority than they
now hold. He based hLs belief on
! that fact that the Conservatives suf
j fer from the overwhelming predomi
nance of Churchill and that the Con
: servative and Labor programs are
very much the same.
He said that many people in Eng

land are feeling uneasy about putting
Churchill in power at a difficult time
like the present, because Churchill
is too impulsive and too willing to
take risks. During the war period
such qualities might be assets, but
now people arc not willing to take
"frightful chances."
Status Quo Preferred
Since Conservative and Labor plat
forms are so much alike, people are
more inclined to leave affairs in the
hands of the people who have been
running things rather than to place
them in the hands of inexperienced
Conservatives.
Furthermore, about 85 percent of
the electorate voted in 1!S50, and since
there is unlikely to be any great in
crease in the number of voters, the
same people would probably vote in
very much the same way. However,
Dr. Buck admitted 'hat the elections
can very well go the other way as it
is a close affair.
Conservative Trends
Dr. Brand made no predictions as
to the results. Instead he pointed to
statistics, and said that the current
trend of opinion favored the Con
servatives. Six weeks ago, according
to the Gallup Poll, the Conservatives
were favored by 11 points. Since
then, however, the lead has narrowed
down to six.
Dr. Brand pointed out that the
Labor Party has made history in that
they have not lost a single seat in
a by-election since 1945. Further
more, in 1950, the Labaritcs succeed
ed in overcoming a 10-point lead to
win the elections.
Attlcc, The Personality
In polls of personality, Attlee stood
out far ahead of his Conservative ri
vals as the most desirable prime
minister. Eden came in second while
Churchill came in third. In a sub
sidiary question—"Which Party will
help you most?"— Labor received a
five-point lead.
Both Dr. Brand and Dr. Buck
pointed out that even if the Conserv
atives came into power, that would
not mean a repudiation of what La
bor had done and what Labor stood

Party is not based only on the fact

Bevan Sees Danger
The m-cvailing opinion is that Bev

and opposed to rearmament. Actu
ally, Dr. Brand said, Bevan thinks
there is danger and there is need for
rearmament. His only difference i.s
the degree of rearmament.
Last summer, the Bevan p roup pre
dicted that if Britain went all out. .she
would strain her economy end thus
destroy the object of rearmament.
Britain did try too hard and as a re

now Britons are faced with the pros
pects of less food and less coal for
the coming winter. Bevan's pre
dictions have thus been fulfilled.
Dr. Brand said that Bevan'.s point
of view i.s something which demands
more careful consideration in this
country and in Britain. For the sake
of party unity, Bevan has not made
an open break with the rest of Labor.
However, the problem will have to
be faced squarely after the elections.

DJJ PHILIP \V BUCK
—"Victory for Labor"
Haunted by the spectre of a
cold and hungry winter at home
and a critical and uncertain situ
ation abroad, Britons will go to
the polls Thursday to choose a
new government. But regardless
I of the outcome, they can expect
little change in their domestic
policies or in their foreign rela
tions.
That was the opinion of two ex
perts in Britjsh affairs, Dr. Carl F.
Braf>d, Professor of History, and Dr.
Philip W. Buck, Professor of Political
Science. In two separate interviews,
the Stanford professors analyzed the
British election scene and answered
specific questions as to what a labor
or a Conservative victory would
mean.
Uneasy About Churchill
| A.s to predictions of the outcome of
| the elections, Dr. Buck said his hunch
J is that the Laborites will win with a
\ slightly increased majority than they
now hold. He based hLs belief on
! that fact that the Conservatives suf
j fer from the overwhelming predomi
nance of Churchill and that the Con
: servative and Labor programs are
very much the same.
He said that many people in Eng

land are feeling uneasy about putting
Churchill in power at a difficult time
like the present, because Churchill
is too impulsive and too willing to
take risks. During the war period
such qualities might be assets, but
now people arc not willing to take
"frightful chances."
Status Quo Preferred
Since Conservative and Labor plat
forms are so much alike, people are
more inclined to leave affairs in the
hands of the people who have been
running things rather than to place
them in the hands of inexperienced
Conservatives.
Furthermore, about 85 percent of
the electorate voted in 1!S50, and since
there is unlikely to be any great in
crease in the number of voters, the
same people would probably vote in
very much the same way. However,
Dr. Buck admitted 'hat the elections
can very well go the other way as it
is a close affair.
Conservative Trends
Dr. Brand made no predictions as
to the results. Instead he pointed to
statistics, and said that the current
trend of opinion favored the Con
servatives. Six weeks ago, according
to the Gallup Poll, the Conservatives
were favored by 11 points. Since
then, however, the lead has narrowed
down to six.
Dr. Brand pointed out that the
Labor Party has made history in that
they have not lost a single seat in
a by-election since 1945. Further
more, in 1950, the Labaritcs succeed
ed in overcoming a 10-point lead to
win the elections.
Attlcc, The Personality
In polls of personality, Attlee stood
out far ahead of his Conservative ri
vals as the most desirable prime
minister. Eden came in second while
Churchill came in third. In a sub
sidiary question—"Which Party will
help you most?"— Labor received a
five-point lead.
Both Dr. Brand and Dr. Buck
pointed out that even if the Conserv
atives came into power, that would
not mean a repudiation of what La
bor had done and what Labor stood

for. A Conservative victory would
mean no further nationalization, but
in the main, the same domestic poli
cies would be followed.
No Major Changes
The two professors also agreed
about the future of the welfare state
in case of a Conservative victory.
They said there would be no major
chances, for the Conservatives were
just as socialistic in disposition as the
Laborites, although few Americans
understood thaf fact.
British Conservatives, in the opinion j
of Dr. Brand, are actually further |
left than American New Dealers. |
Dr. Brand also said the National >
Health program has the overwhelm- i
ing support of the masses, and all !
that the Conservatives can do i.s to j
promise better administration and !
better deals for the doctors. Housing j
projects have been another impor- j
♦ ant item in election .speeches on both
sides. While the Laborites promised
200,000 new houses, the Conservatives
promised 300.000.
Foreign Policy
In the field of foreign policy, Dr. j
Buck said the Conservatives are i
likely to conduct a more aggressive |
policy if they come into power. While !
the people realize that the situation !
in the Near East is worse, they do j
not blame it on the Laborites. They ]
will probably think that the Laborites ;
will take less chances if they handled i
the situation.
Both parties are pledged to rearm
ament, and they will rearm as much ;
as possible. However, Dr. Buck said I
Great Britain is very hard pressed
economically, and the United States
should remember that fact.
An Unexpected Issue
Dr. Brand said that foreign affairs '
was not originally an issue in the j
campaign. But since the issue of the
party manifestos, things in Iran,
Iraq, and Egypt came to a head. For
eign affairs thus becomc a serious
and unexpected issue.
The Laborites have accuse d
Churchill of being a warmonger, but j
Dr. Brand said that he thought the j
accusation was not a fair one. "No

responsible British statesman can he
a warmonger. The British economy
is dependent upon a peaceful world.
Th"ir economy is in a precarious po
sition and they know it," Dr. Brand
said.
Rearmament Injurious
Continuing, he said the rate of re
armament has sent the British econ
omy into a tailspin. Whereas four
months ago the government came
close to balancing the budget, now
there is a deficit of $600,000,000. At
the present rate, Britain would he
bankrupt in 18 months.
For that reason a great deal of at
tention has been paid to Aneurin
Bevan, who is one of the most for
midable figures in British politics and
Churchill's only rival on the plat
form. The cleavage in the Labor
Party is not based only on the fact
that Bevan wants a bigger dose of
socialism, but also on Bevan's attitude

Conservatives.
Furthermore, about 85 percent of
the electorate voted in 1!S50, and since
there is unlikely to be any great in
crease in the number of voters, the
same people would probably vote in
very much the same way. However,
Dr. Buck admitted 'hat the elections
can very well go the other way as it
is a close affair.
Conservative Trends
Dr. Brand made no predictions as
to the results. Instead he pointed to
statistics, and said that the current
trend of opinion favored the Con
servatives. Six weeks ago, according
to the Gallup Poll, the Conservatives
were favored by 11 points. Since
then, however, the lead has narrowed
down to six.
Dr. Brand pointed out that the
Labor Party has made history in that
they have not lost a single seat in
a by-election since 1945. Further
more, in 1950, the Labaritcs succeed
ed in overcoming a 10-point lead to
win the elections.
Attlcc, The Personality
In polls of personality, Attlee stood
out far ahead of his Conservative ri
vals as the most desirable prime
minister. Eden came in second while
Churchill came in third. In a sub
sidiary question—"Which Party will
help you most?"— Labor received a
five-point lead.
Both Dr. Brand and Dr. Buck
pointed out that even if the Conserv
atives came into power, that would
not mean a repudiation of what La
bor had done and what Labor stood

for. A Conservative victory would
mean no further nationalization, but
in the main, the same domestic poli
cies would be followed.
No Major Changes
The two professors also agreed
about the future of the welfare state
in case of a Conservative victory.
They said there would be no major
chances, for the Conservatives were
just as socialistic in disposition as the
Laborites, although few Americans
understood thaf fact.
British Conservatives, in the opinion j
of Dr. Brand, are actually further |
left than American New Dealers. |
Dr. Brand also said the National >
Health program has the overwhelm- i
ing support of the masses, and all !
that the Conservatives can do i.s to j
promise better administration and !
better deals for the doctors. Housing j
projects have been another impor- j
♦ ant item in election .speeches on both
sides. While the Laborites promised
200,000 new houses, the Conservatives
promised 300.000.
Foreign Policy
In the field of foreign policy, Dr. j
Buck said the Conservatives are i
likely to conduct a more aggressive |
policy if they come into power. While !
the people realize that the situation !
in the Near East is worse, they do j
not blame it on the Laborites. They ]
will probably think that the Laborites ;
will take less chances if they handled i
the situation.
Both parties are pledged to rearm
ament, and they will rearm as much ;
as possible. However, Dr. Buck said I
Great Britain is very hard pressed
economically, and the United States
should remember that fact.
An Unexpected Issue
Dr. Brand said that foreign affairs '
was not originally an issue in the j
campaign. But since the issue of the
party manifestos, things in Iran,
Iraq, and Egypt came to a head. For
eign affairs thus becomc a serious
and unexpected issue.
The Laborites have accuse d
Churchill of being a warmonger, but j
Dr. Brand said that he thought the j
accusation was not a fair one. "No

responsible British statesman can he
a warmonger. The British economy
is dependent upon a peaceful world.
Th"ir economy is in a precarious po
sition and they know it," Dr. Brand
said.
Rearmament Injurious
Continuing, he said the rate of re
armament has sent the British econ
omy into a tailspin. Whereas four
months ago the government came
close to balancing the budget, now
there is a deficit of $600,000,000. At
the present rate, Britain would he
bankrupt in 18 months.
For that reason a great deal of at
tention has been paid to Aneurin
Bevan, who is one of the most for
midable figures in British politics and
Churchill's only rival on the plat
form. The cleavage in the Labor
Party is not based only on the fact
that Bevan wants a bigger dose of
socialism, but also on Bevan's attitude
towards rearmament.
Bevan Sees Danger
The m-cvailing opinion is that Bev
an is anti - American, pro-Russian,
and opposed to rearmament. Actu
ally, Dr. Brand said, Bevan thinks
there is danger and there is need for
rearmament. His only difference i.s
the degree of rearmament.
Last summer, the Bevan p roup pre
dicted that if Britain went all out. .she
would strain her economy end thus
destroy the object of rearmament.
Britain did try too hard and as a re
sult her economy broke down, and
now Britons are faced with the pros
pects of less food and less coal for
the coming winter. Bevan's pre
dictions have thus been fulfilled.
Dr. Brand said that Bevan'.s point
of view i.s something which demands
more careful consideration in this
country and in Britain. For the sake
of party unity, Bevan has not made
an open break with the rest of Labor.
However, the problem will have to
be faced squarely after the elections.

DJJ PHILIP \V BUCK
—"Victory for Labor"
Haunted by the spectre of a
cold and hungry winter at home
and a critical and uncertain situ
ation abroad, Britons will go to
the polls Thursday to choose a
new government. But regardless
I of the outcome, they can expect
little change in their domestic
policies or in their foreign rela
tions.
That was the opinion of two ex
perts in Britjsh affairs, Dr. Carl F.
Braf>d, Professor of History, and Dr.
Philip W. Buck, Professor of Political
Science. In two separate interviews,
the Stanford professors analyzed the
British election scene and answered
specific questions as to what a labor
or a Conservative victory would
mean.
Uneasy About Churchill
| A.s to predictions of the outcome of
| the elections, Dr. Buck said his hunch
J is that the Laborites will win with a
\ slightly increased majority than they
now hold. He based hLs belief on
! that fact that the Conservatives suf
j fer from the overwhelming predomi
nance of Churchill and that the Con
: servative and Labor programs are
very much the same.
He said that many people in Eng

land are feeling uneasy about putting
Churchill in power at a difficult time
like the present, because Churchill
is too impulsive and too willing to
take risks. During the war period
such qualities might be assets, but
now people arc not willing to take
"frightful chances."
Status Quo Preferred
Since Conservative and Labor plat
forms are so much alike, people are
more inclined to leave affairs in the
hands of the people who have been
running things rather than to place
them in the hands of inexperienced
Conservatives.
Furthermore, about 85 percent of
the electorate voted in 1!S50, and since
there is unlikely to be any great in
crease in the number of voters, the
same people would probably vote in
very much the same way. However,
