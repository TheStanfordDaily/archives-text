Applications for the second
Selective Service College Qual
ification Tests are now available
at the local boards in this area,
Chief Counselor for Men Richard
Ealch said yesterday.
However, Balch reported that stu
dents considering taking the test
should first chock with the office of
the men's counselor, room 101-B,
Inner Quad, due to complications
which have arisen concerning the
test at Stanford.
According to a statement released
by the men's counselor:
"All men enrolled in the University
who have not taken the Selective

Service Qualification Test and who
are desirous of receiving a defer
ment through the authority vested
in draft boards to defer by stand
ing in class and or the score on the
SS Qualification Test are request
ed to call at the Office of the Chief
Counselor for Men at the earliest
possible time.
"Freshmen and sophomores are re
quested to schedule themselves for
the April 24 test as the SS Qualifica
tion Test will be in conflict with ex
aminations scheduled by the Univer
sity on Dec. 13. The examinations
given on Dec. 13 are common to the
program of most freshmen and some
sophomores.
"As all men currently enrolled as
freshmen in Stanford University are

1 statutorily deferred (deferred by ;
law for their academic year), there !
| is no pressing need to take the Dec.
: 13 test for Selective Service.
"Any sophomore, juni or , or j
senior student who is over lS'/a and j
' who has not taken the SS Qualifi
| cation Test may find it to his best
interests to take the Dec. 13 test.
j "If such a student has a conflict
| with a regularly scheduled exami
nation, he should submit a petition j
to the Secretary of the Committee j
I on Schedules and Examinations in
! room 111R in the Registrar's office.
"It should be understood that fresh
! men who delay thr taking of the test
until April 24 will not jeopardize
their chances for deferment the fol
j lowing year and are deferred by law i
t for the current academic year."
