## British Armed Tank Force Seizes Installations at Suez 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt, Oct. 22 (UP)—A large British armed force, spear
headed by 20 tanks, was reported late today to have seized the
railway stations, arsenal, and other installations on the outskirts
of Suez—the city guarding the southern entrance to the Suez Canal.
Suez Governor Ibrahim Zaki Elkholi Bey told United Press staff

correspondent Zaki Salama that the
British force had moved in, cutting
off the city's railway communications
with Cairo and Ismailia.
The action was taken after British
destroyers earlier in the day had es
corted six British supply ships into
the disputed canal and British troops
had seized four railway stations in
the vicinity of Suez to assure the
movement of military supplies to
threatened British Canal Zone garri
sons.
With the occupation of all strategic
points in Suez, the British nailed
down their control of all railway and
highway communications between
Suez and the rest of Egypt.
The British already have completed
control of the Caiio-Suez and Is
mailia-Suez desert roads.
Suez is the first city the British
have undertaken to control in the
Canal Zone since the 1936 treaty
authorizing British garrisons in the
vital Canal area was abrogated by
the Egyptian government.
