NEW YORK. Oct. 22 (UP)â€”Strik
ing AFL longshoremen halted a
shipment of ambulances for Korean
war wounded today and tied up
more than $11,000,000 in commercial
cargoes in the nation's largest port.
Bloody hand -to - hand battles
broke out in the wildcat stoppage
which has almost paralyzed New
York's vast waterfront.
