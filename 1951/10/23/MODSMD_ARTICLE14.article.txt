# Permission Required To Give Blood
## 
### 
Parental permission slips are now
available for students between 18 and
21 years of age who want to donate
blood Oct. 30, when a Red Cross
mobile blood collection unit will visit
Stanford.
Goal for the collection is 350 pints
of blood for the Armed Forces. The
permission slips, which the donors
under 21 must present before making
appointments, were distributed in
living groups last night by the Stu
dent Health Committee, which is
sponsoring the campus blood collec
tion.

Appointment Booths

Starting tomorrow, appointment
booths will be open at the Cellar and
Main Library from 9 a.m. until noon.
The mobile unit from San Jose will
be on the main floor of the Women's
Clubhouse from 8:30 a.m. to noon and
1 to 4 p.m. Oct. 30. Giving blood will
take approximately 45 minutes.
Persons 18 to 60 years of age are
eligible to donate if they weigh at
least 110 pounds, have not given blood
within thre emonths, and are in good
general health. Only persons under
21 need parental permission, which
must be obtained on the official Red
Cross forms. The forms must be pre
sented before appointments can be
made.
Permission slips will be available
at the appointment booths as well as
in living groupsâ€”especially for the
convenience of off-campus students,
Student Health Committee Chairman
Pete Halle pointed out. Alpha Phi
Omega will help the committee staff
the booths.
The Stanford Medical School has
promised to fill a 60-pint quota and
the Arnold Air Society will also make
a special donation, Halle reported.
In order to meet the 350-pint overall
quota, 400 doners must sign up to
allow for rejects.
Quota Up
The Stanford quota for this fall's
drive has been upped 100 pints from
last year's 250-pint quotas because
of unusually acute need, Red Cross
officials commented. The local blood
collection is part of a national Red
Cross drive to get 2,800.000 pints of
blood by July, 1952, a goal set by the
Defense Department to fill Armed
Forces needs.
"This is one of the few opportuni
ties a person has in his life to give
something away without losing any
thing," Halle commented.
The blood plasma reserve built up
from blood collected by the Red Cross
during World War II is credited with
cutting the mortality rate in the
Korean War. The mortality rate of
2.6 out of every hundred men reach
ing the most forward hospitals was
the lowest in history.
