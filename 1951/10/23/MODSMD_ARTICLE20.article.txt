# Bonfire Wood Mounts in Luke Lag
## 
### 
Wood, brush, and debris arc now
piled in the middle of Lake Lag.
But this doesn't mean that the
waterless lake has been turned into
an all - campus dump heap. The
wood is only part of the steadily
growing Big Game Bonfire, whicb
the freshman men began collecting
last week.

"There's been very good progress
so far," chairman Herb Dwight re
ported enthusiastically. Three fires
hindered progress at first, but now
that the police have caught the
vandals responsible, the bonfire
builders expect smoother sailing.
The frosh started collecting a
week ago yesterday. The work

.schedule calls for afternoon shifts
five days a week, and volunteers arc
signed up a wing at a time.
A "friend of Stanford" lent a
truck to pick up the wood, which is
being donated in answer to ap
peals in Peninsula papers. If any
one has donations, he is asked to
call DA 3-R2Ol. the ASSU office, j
Dwight explained.

The fuel is now spread out over a
large area, because this way it is
harder to set on fire. Actual con
struction of the compact heap will
start the Monday before Big Game.
Beginning to collect, wood almost
six weeks before Big Game, this
year's bonfire builders may be set
ting a record for an early start,
Dwight speculated.
