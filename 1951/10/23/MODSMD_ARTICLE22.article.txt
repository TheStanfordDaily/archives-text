# Seventeen Band Members to Go North for Game
## 
### 
Approximately 17 members of the
Stanford band will make the trip to
Seattle for Saturday's game with the
University of Washington, Band
Manager Jerry Krieg said yesterday.
The move has the approval of the
B.A.C.
Krieg said most of the 17 will make
the trip by car and probably two by
train. He described the group as
"well balanced musically." Band
members making the trip will pay
their own expenses except for game
tickets, which the B.A.C. is expected
to provide.
There will probably not be enough
men for a marching band, Krieg said,
but they will form a section in the
stands.
