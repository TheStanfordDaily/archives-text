The move to de-emphasize inter
collegiate athletics, running ram
pant among small schools and espe
cially prevalent on the Middle and
Southern East Coast, claimed an
other school last week as the Cava
lier Daily of the University of Vir
ginia bannered a faculty commit
tee's report recommending the de
emphasis of university athletics
there.
The Virginia faculty report fol
lowed on the heels of a poll of ocl
lege presidents in that state which
revealed that they "all agree that
too much emphasis on athletics can
he very detrimental to a school."
"A renewal of faculty control of
University athletics" was called for
in the Virginia statement, and it was
urged "that Virginia take the lead
in restoring athletics to a pure am
ateur basis."
The exercise of complete control
over the eligibility of students on
athletic squads by the general fac
ulty was "emphatically" urged. And
the professors also recommended a
banning of special subsidies and
scholarships for athletics.
The Cavalier Daily emphasized
editorially that in the lengthy (43-
page) report "nowhere does the re
port intimate that there ai*e any
malpractices involved in the ad
ministration of Virginia's athletic
program. Our linen is clean."
The paper pointed out that what
the faculty committee "advocates is
a policy change—a shift away from
'big athletics.' They report no sit
uation reflecting discredit upon ei
ther the University or its athletic
department."
The Cavalier felt, however, that
"a hasty glance over their report
leaves us with the impression that it
is extreme."
