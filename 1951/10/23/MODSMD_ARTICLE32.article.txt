Alpha Tau Omega reports a good first day
for their Help Week project of cleaning up the
Palo Alto YMCA headguarters. The 21 pledges
worked long and hard at fence building yester
day, but we'll venture the guess that they count
the time as better spent than it would have been
doing pushups and saluting actives. The ATO
Help Week is replacing the usual Hell Week
shenanigans for pledges.
Meanwhile, Tony Garrett, Interfraternity
Council president, expressed his enthusiasm
for the idea. "I think it's indicative of a new and
healthy attitude among fraternities at Stanford,"
Garrett said.
Garrett said IFC will talk about the idea when
the group meets in two weeks or so. But if
the ATO plan is to spread along the Row and
become the Stanford Plan, the positive action
must come from the individual fraternity
houses.
It will be a great day for Stanford when all
the fraternities here decide to cut out the
wasted time and foolishness of Hell Week and
substitute the constructive work of Help Week.

Plans are getting underway for the biggest
blood drive in Stanford's history. A guota of
350 pints has been set for the campus this year,
an increase of 100 pints over last year's guota.
The need has never been greater.
The mobile blood unit will be here Oct. 30.
Blood drive officials remind students under 21
that they must gain parental permission before
giving blood. Since a good number of Stan
fordites are under the legal age limit, much ol
the drive's success depends on whether or not
students take the time to write home for per
mission.
It's good to hear that a few bandsmen are
packing their horns and preparing for the 1,000
mile trip to Seattle and the Washington game.
The Huskies will be tough to defeat at home but
the appearance of the token band will let Wash
ington folk know Stanford's at hand for sure.
It will be something of a vacation for the
bandsmen, anyway. They won't have to worry
about marching at half time, because no matter
how much noise 15 horns can generate, 15 men
look awfully lonely in the middle of the field.
Couldn't even make a decent Block S.
