### DICK McLEAN 
Yesterday I laid the case before you. My points
were: The students at large do not want the foreign
language requirement as it exists. The luling, though
originally designed to foster liberal education, now
works to the opposite end. The various language de
partments would benefit internally from a healthy
change in the rule.
But if you tear down a structure, you should rebuild
something substantial in its place. For that reason I

suggest some possible solutions to
the problem.
First let me clarify a few points.
My objection is not to foreign
languages in general nor the var
ious departments. The value of
knowing another people, their cul
ture and thought, is huge in this
shrinking world full of tension
but lacking in understanding.
The contribution of liberal edu
cation is perhaps the only answer

to the question of how the society of nations shall
.survive their own ability to destroy one another.
But what I do object to is the present foreign lan
guage requirement, that archaic and musty rule. I
don't say throw out all language requirements; but
th row out the present one. Let the Scholarship Com
mittee make up its mind whether the regulation shall
be a tool (thus allowing the students to speak the lan
guage and read its literature) or make it an intellectual
function (to give the student some real cultural and
humanistic background.)
But as conditions exist the undergraduate is caught
in the insipid middleground.
Here are a few suggested solutions:
1) Teach the language for purely practical purposes.
Make the time spent in the language useful. Perhaps
less emphasis could be placed on the strict grammatical
rules and idioms and more emphasis put on speaking
the language. Such valuable aids as motion pictures
and phonograph records could liven up the classes.
It nothing else, the student could go to another country
and move about freely without an interpreter.
I» the classes were taught with this aim and this
method in mind, then the time and units required
would be shorter and interest would be much higher.
More students would want to continue their studies
rather than forget the "language ordeal" as fast as
possible.
2) Perhaps a course which used a good English trans

lalion of a book from a foreign tongue that would not
only give a flavor of the country and the national
thought but stimulate the thinking of the student as
well. This plan might be combined with a course in
latin roots and present derivations. Thus the two com
bined could give dual benefits, directly practical and
broadening to the mind.
.'{) Treating the problem more from the liberal edu
cation side, the whole language requirement could he
swallowed up in a general education curriculum. This
course would encompass many of the social sciences
and give the student some knowledge of foreign coun
tries but also a greater grasp of the world in which he
lives. Thus the student would be a better citizen of
his own country and a more useful citizen of mankind.
4) Another plan arid one which is currently under
discussion by the faculty has some good possibilities.
This plan is to give the basic essence of the language
in three three-unit courses and then to present three
more three-unit courses which would treat the adult
and meaningful literature of that country. Instead of
a word by word, idiom by idiom translation with the
emphasis upon grammar, the emphasis would be upon
the ideas. For the course taught in such a manner a
supplementary English translation would be recom
mended.
The obvious advantages of this would be more stu
dent interest, some incentive not to misrepresent one's
ability in a placement test, in that the latter section of
the course would be more cultural and philosophical
than linguistic.
The difficulty as I see it would be the danger of
this becoming a paper reform (one which is widely
announced but with conditions continuing on as be
fore) and the difficulty of obtaining adequate texts
and professors to teach it on the high level that is vital
to its success.
But I am not an educator. These solutions are only
ideas thrown out to be discussed. I think that many
of them have some merit and that they work in the
right direction.
But I am a student. I've been through the "lan
guage ordeal" and I believe that the present language
requirement must go. I also believe that a lot of you
share this view. But this I know—if we want this rule
changed, and will make our decision known, and will
work toward that end, we shall win.
Tomorrow's Bull Session and the last in this series
of three will be entitled "The Coucse of Action."

It nothing else, the student could go to another country
and move about freely without an interpreter.
I» the classes were taught with this aim and this
method in mind, then the time and units required
would be shorter and interest would be much higher.
More students would want to continue their studies
rather than forget the "language ordeal" as fast as
possible.
2) Perhaps a course which used a good English trans

lalion of a book from a foreign tongue that would not
only give a flavor of the country and the national
thought but stimulate the thinking of the student as
well. This plan might be combined with a course in
latin roots and present derivations. Thus the two com
bined could give dual benefits, directly practical and
broadening to the mind.
.'{) Treating the problem more from the liberal edu
cation side, the whole language requirement could he
swallowed up in a general education curriculum. This
course would encompass many of the social sciences
and give the student some knowledge of foreign coun
tries but also a greater grasp of the world in which he
lives. Thus the student would be a better citizen of
his own country and a more useful citizen of mankind.
4) Another plan arid one which is currently under
discussion by the faculty has some good possibilities.
This plan is to give the basic essence of the language
in three three-unit courses and then to present three
more three-unit courses which would treat the adult
and meaningful literature of that country. Instead of
a word by word, idiom by idiom translation with the
emphasis upon grammar, the emphasis would be upon
the ideas. For the course taught in such a manner a
supplementary English translation would be recom
mended.
The obvious advantages of this would be more stu
dent interest, some incentive not to misrepresent one's
ability in a placement test, in that the latter section of
the course would be more cultural and philosophical
than linguistic.
The difficulty as I see it would be the danger of
this becoming a paper reform (one which is widely
announced but with conditions continuing on as be
fore) and the difficulty of obtaining adequate texts
and professors to teach it on the high level that is vital
to its success.
But I am not an educator. These solutions are only
ideas thrown out to be discussed. I think that many
of them have some merit and that they work in the
right direction.
But I am a student. I've been through the "lan
guage ordeal" and I believe that the present language
requirement must go. I also believe that a lot of you
share this view. But this I know—if we want this rule
changed, and will make our decision known, and will
work toward that end, we shall win.
Tomorrow's Bull Session and the last in this series
of three will be entitled "The Coucse of Action."

Yesterday I laid the case before you. My points
were: The students at large do not want the foreign
language requirement as it exists. The luling, though
originally designed to foster liberal education, now
works to the opposite end. The various language de
partments would benefit internally from a healthy
change in the rule.
But if you tear down a structure, you should rebuild
something substantial in its place. For that reason I

suggest some possible solutions to
the problem.
First let me clarify a few points.
My objection is not to foreign
languages in general nor the var
ious departments. The value of
knowing another people, their cul
ture and thought, is huge in this
shrinking world full of tension
but lacking in understanding.
The contribution of liberal edu
cation is perhaps the only answer

to the question of how the society of nations shall
.survive their own ability to destroy one another.
But what I do object to is the present foreign lan
guage requirement, that archaic and musty rule. I
don't say throw out all language requirements; but
th row out the present one. Let the Scholarship Com
mittee make up its mind whether the regulation shall
be a tool (thus allowing the students to speak the lan
guage and read its literature) or make it an intellectual
function (to give the student some real cultural and
humanistic background.)
But as conditions exist the undergraduate is caught
in the insipid middleground.
Here are a few suggested solutions:
1) Teach the language for purely practical purposes.
Make the time spent in the language useful. Perhaps
less emphasis could be placed on the strict grammatical
rules and idioms and more emphasis put on speaking
the language. Such valuable aids as motion pictures
and phonograph records could liven up the classes.
It nothing else, the student could go to another country
and move about freely without an interpreter.
I» the classes were taught with this aim and this

dent interest, some incentive not to misrepresent one's
ability in a placement test, in that the latter section of
the course would be more cultural and philosophical
than linguistic.
The difficulty as I see it would be the danger of
this becoming a paper reform (one which is widely
announced but with conditions continuing on as be
fore) and the difficulty of obtaining adequate texts
and professors to teach it on the high level that is vital
to its success.
But I am not an educator. These solutions are only
ideas thrown out to be discussed. I think that many
of them have some merit and that they work in the
right direction.
But I am a student. I've been through the "lan
guage ordeal" and I believe that the present language
requirement must go. I also believe that a lot of you
share this view. But this I know—if we want this rule
changed, and will make our decision known, and will
work toward that end, we shall win.
Tomorrow's Bull Session and the last in this series
of three will be entitled "The Coucse of Action."
