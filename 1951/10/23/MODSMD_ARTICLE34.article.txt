## Kansas U. Applies for Tf 
### WALT MENNINGER 
Not satisfied with AM radio
broadcasting, which they now
have, and FM, which will go into
operation Jan. 1, Kansas Univer
sity has submitted an applica
tion for a campus television
channel. The future of the ap
plication, according to the Uni
versity Daily Kansan, will be un
known until a decision is ren
dered by the FCC in 1952.
Meanwhile Michigan State Col
lege has also made a formal appli
cation for a commercial TV chan
nel. The Michigan State News
pointed out that if the application is
granted, they will be the second ed
ucational institution to have such
an outlet.
Elsewhere on the airways, the
University of Oregon just this fall
inaugurated a full - time, student
operated FM radio station—KWAX
—"The Voice of the Oregon Ducks,"
which marks an end to a 30-year
struggle to establish a university
radio station in Eugene.

Alpiners exist even in Kansas—at
least so the Daily Kansan says. At
KU a group of mountain-climbing
enthusiasts have formed a moun
taineering club, and have taken
several trips to the Rockies. Where
do they train and practice? On the
football stadium.

Campaign politics run hot and
heavy at the University of Virginia
where the Cavalier Daily reports
the charges and counter-charges of

the two campus parties—the Uni
versity party and the Cavalier par
ty. The latest flurry resulted when
the University party "unleashed a
tirade of criticism against the Cava
lier party, accusing it of making
'unfounded promises' and of 'de
facing' the first - year dormitories
with campaign posters."
A Cavalier party spokesman said
he could find "no justification"
for the "mudslinging" accusation
brought against his party.

The Technology News of the
Illinois Institute of Technology
tells of the current construction
of a research laboratory at lIT
which can claim "more bounce to
the ounce." The reason why—one
section of the floor will rest on
springs to cushion delicate re
search instruments which would
be disturbed by vibrations from
passing traffic.

"Abraham Lincoln wore 'ein, so
why can't we?" So students at USC
have been pointing out, according
to the Daily Trojan, when asked
about their latest craze—string ties.
The fad started this last summer
with the rationalization, "You know
—the heat!"
The thin chokers, the "new look
in the old school tie," come in every
imaginable color. In explaining
where the craze originated, the Tro
jan points to Las Vegas- "more
specifically, the croupiers in the
gambling houses."

At San Jose State, one Jinx John
son, a senior social science major,
is in a mess. It seems that his father
has enrolled as a freshman psych

major at SJS and the school has had
considerable trouble in keeping Sr.
and Jr. straight. The crowning blow
was reached recently when Alpha
Phi Omega, the service fraternity,
to which Jinx belongs, decided to
pledge Johnson Sr. At this time,
the Spartan Daily explains, Jinx is
"'sweating out' an emotional or
deal."

While the Stanford Bookstore
lias declared an additional rebate
Washington State is having Book
store troubles. An editorial in the
WSC Daily Evergreen has panned
the Bookstore there for several
failings, as it points out, "It's sad
that they (the Bookstore) seem to
have hit an all - time low this
year. . . . The bookie has always
been the student's right arm but
lately it wouldn't even qualify as
a poor left thumb!"

At the University of Oklahoma,
whiteboards are replacing black
boards. They're preferred, says the
Oklahoma Daily, because they are
less costly, have less glare, and don't
produce messy chalk dust.

And while here, the new Califor
nia liquor law puts the blame (and
penalty- on the student, in Wiscon
sin the shoe is still on the other
foot. Bartenders at the famous Uni
versity of Wisconsin Rathskeller
have been warned that they will be
held personally responsible for sell
in? beer to minors. The Daily Car
dinal says that the warning came
about when two men were arrested
on charges of procuring beer for a
student under 18.
