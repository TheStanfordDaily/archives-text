# David and Bathsheba' Elegant, Slut Too Long
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"David and Bathsheba," now at the Stanford, is undeniably a
quality picture, seriously conceived and tastefully filmed, a val
iant effort on Producer Darryl F. Zanuck's part to give audiences
something more than the hocus-pocus served up periodically by
C. B. de Mille. But de Mille—at his best genuinely spectacular,

at his worst hilariously pretentious
—is, at least, never boring. "David
and Bathsheba," on the other hand,
emerges as a great lump of long
winded dullness.
The first half of the picture wan
ders about with no apparent aim
whatsoever. David, king of all Is
rael, sees Uriah's wife, Bathsheba,
bathing—though why he is so ex
cited is difficult to understand, since
she is seen at a very great distance
and is even then impeccably con
cealed behind an enormous screen.
Nevertheless, he calls her to his
palace and she becomes his mis
tress.
Scenes Drag
There follows a dragging pro
gression of scenes from which we
learn two things: David and Bath
sheba are extraordinarily fond of
walks in the country; something is
rotten in the state of Israel.
What is rotten, we eventually
discover, is David. He has strayed
from God, even resorts to having
Uriah killed so that he can marry
Bathsheba (with child "by now) in
an effort to save her from the adul
teress's death by stoning.
This plot fails, for David has not
repented his sins, and God, having
unleashed his fury in the form of
a devastating drought, demands re
pentance. Finally, just as the angry
mobs are storming the palace gates
to stone Bathsheba, David returns
to God, makes his peace with him,
and Bathsheba, as well as Israel, is
saved.
If aimlessness is the fault of the
first half of the picture, misuse of
climax is the fault of the second
half. We are brought, for example,
to a pitch of high excitement by the
bloodthirsty mobs at the gates, only
to be let down by a long sequence
in which David, accompanying him
self on the harp, recites the 23rd
Psalm for Bathsheba. , Again, the
suspense of David's repentance is
interrupted by a flashback to his
shepherd day battle with the giant
Goliath, at this point completely ir
relevant.
It is unfortunate that the picture
is so tedious, for in all other re

spects—excepting a totally luster
less performance by Susan Hay
ward as Bathsheba—it is admirable.
The script is tasteful, the Techni
color beautiful, and the sets look
authentic. Hollywood's able Greg
ory Peck lends David some real
depth. But prospective audiences
will find the David and Bathsheba
story far more interesting and excit
ing as it is told in the Bible itself
than in this liabby film adaptation.

"David and Bathsheba," now at the Stanford, is undeniably a
quality picture, seriously conceived and tastefully filmed, a val
iant effort on Producer Darryl F. Zanuck's part to give audiences
something more than the hocus-pocus served up periodically by
C. B. de Mille. But de Mille—at his best genuinely spectacular,

at his worst hilariously pretentious
—is, at least, never boring. "David
and Bathsheba," on the other hand,
emerges as a great lump of long
winded dullness.
The first half of the picture wan
ders about with no apparent aim
whatsoever. David, king of all Is
rael, sees Uriah's wife, Bathsheba,
bathing—though why he is so ex
cited is difficult to understand, since
she is seen at a very great distance
and is even then impeccably con
cealed behind an enormous screen.
Nevertheless, he calls her to his
palace and she becomes his mis
tress.
Scenes Drag
There follows a dragging pro
gression of scenes from which we
learn two things: David and Bath
sheba are extraordinarily fond of
walks in the country; something is
rotten in the state of Israel.
What is rotten, we eventually
discover, is David. He has strayed
from God, even resorts to having
Uriah killed so that he can marry
Bathsheba (with child "by now) in
an effort to save her from the adul
teress's death by stoning.
This plot fails, for David has not
repented his sins, and God, having
unleashed his fury in the form of
a devastating drought, demands re
pentance. Finally, just as the angry
mobs are storming the palace gates
to stone Bathsheba, David returns
to God, makes his peace with him,
and Bathsheba, as well as Israel, is
saved.
If aimlessness is the fault of the
first half of the picture, misuse of
climax is the fault of the second
half. We are brought, for example,
to a pitch of high excitement by the
bloodthirsty mobs at the gates, only
to be let down by a long sequence
in which David, accompanying him
self on the harp, recites the 23rd
Psalm for Bathsheba. , Again, the
suspense of David's repentance is
interrupted by a flashback to his
shepherd day battle with the giant
Goliath, at this point completely ir
relevant.
It is unfortunate that the picture
is so tedious, for in all other re

spects—excepting a totally luster
less performance by Susan Hay
ward as Bathsheba—it is admirable.
The script is tasteful, the Techni
color beautiful, and the sets look
authentic. Hollywood's able Greg
ory Peck lends David some real
depth. But prospective audiences
will find the David and Bathsheba
story far more interesting and excit
ing as it is told in the Bible itself
than in this liabby film adaptation.
