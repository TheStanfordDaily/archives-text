# Crist to Replace Rice
## 
### 
Skip Crist was shifted from offen
sive fullback to linebacker yester
day in an effort to bolster Stanford's
injury-ridden ranks. He will re
place Gordy Rice, who is out for the
season with a cracked tibia.
Jesse Cone was in uniform, after
a week's absence, but was favoring
his injured knee. He is still a ques
tion mark for this Saturday's game
against Washington up at Seattle.
Bob Griffin's knee was not respond
ing as it had been expected. High
stepping Eric Southwood is defi
nitely out.
On the more favorable side of
the ledger, defensive tackles Barry

Smith and Dick Gant returned af
ter an absence of several weeks.
Smith has recovered from an arm
operation and Gant from a foot in
jury. Fullback Bob Meyers was
also running at full speed, although
he worked out in sweat clothes.
The offense was given some new
plays to throw at Washington, while
the Braves emulated the Huskies
and gave the defense a taste of
Washington plays. After the work
out, the team adjourned to the BAC
where they reviewed a scouting re
port on Washington.
Most of the San Francisco spoi'ts
writers seem to feel that Washing
ton will provide the real test for
Stanford. The consensus is that the
Huskies will be the strongest team
that Stanford will have faced.
