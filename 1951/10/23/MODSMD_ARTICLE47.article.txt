### 
With bucks Lloyd Kelly and Herb
Dwight leading the way, Phi Kap
pa's unbeaten football squad swept :
to their fourth straight intramural
victory yesterday, 19 -0, over an ;
outclassed but fighting Alpha Delt '
team. The Phi Kaps have yet to
be scored upon in league play.
Two of Phi Kap's three touch
downs came in the first half of plaz
as the unbeaten fraternity men
quickly took command of the situ
ation. Kelly, playing in the tail
back spot, hit center Mike Tormey
with a 25-yard touchc'own pass to
climax a sustained Phi Kap drive.
Later in the first half, Kelly, be
hind beautiful blocking by his for
ward wall, wheeled back to pass
but, seeing his receivers covered,
carried the ball for 30 yards and
another TD.
The final score came in the wan
ing moments of the game when a
desperate scoring attempt by the
Alpha Delts, featuring the passing
of tailback Dick Leonard, was stop
ped by a Phi Kap pass interception.
In another rough contest, Sigma
Chi's bruising footballers eked out
a 13-0 win over the Alpha Sigs.
Ray Haile participated in both scor
ing plays.
