And so Southern Cal proved that Cal isn't superhuman.
We nw know thai the Bear gridders get up in the morning. Just like
everyone else. They put their shoes on and break bread three times a day.
They are human, not invincible'robots who do nothing but win football
games. We also know that when the first six left guards are injured that
the seventh string left euard can't step in and be just as adept as the first.

And just as we found out that Cal
can be beaten, we also learned that
the Blundering Herd is now the
Thundering Herd. Jess Hill may
have the most despised lot of gridders
on the Coast, but he also has the team
most likely to be in the Rose Bowl on
the first of January. Those of you
who are on the Stanford bandwagon
better hang on real tight around the
corners, because it's going to be tough
sledding from here on in.
Most of the guys on the team were
pulling for Cal to win, because now
that the Trojans have triumphed,
they will be very difficult to keep

away from Pasadena. SC has only two more conference games-—Stanford
and UCLA. Stanford, on the other hand, has Washington, Washington State,
Oregon State, Southern Cal, and Cal. Not a breather in the lot.
The experts say that the Cards will be doing very well to even win three
of those. And we are inclined to agree that if Chuck Taylor can guide the
Indians through that Herculean schedule unscathed it will be one of the
greatest come-through efforts in PCC history. Certainly, the tip-off will
be this week at Washington. If Stanford can get by the Huskies, they could
conceivably go all the way. But take it from the scouts, Washington is
loaded from stem to stern.
And yet, somehow we put a lot of faith in that great gang of guys who
knock hell out of each other from 4 p.m. to (J p.m. five times a week. They
have little regard fur what the "experts" say. When they're supposed to win
by a comfortable margin, they just squeak by, and when they're supposed
to lose, they whale the daylight out of the opposition.
Stanford doesn't have the type of team that bowls an opponent over, but
somehow or other they always manage to come through in the clutch. In
three of the five victories, the Cards have been scored on first. In the other
two, they were tied and in considerable trouble. But great come-through
performances have won for the Indians. Here are some examples:
Bob Meyers gets injured, and a trackman who's only played two minutes
of college ball steps in and scores four touchdowns in two games, giving
forth the same type of performance that won him the Olympic decathalon
title at the age of 17. Things look bad, and then a guy named McColl leaps
a country mile into the air to snag a long pass, shaking off three defenders.
The score is tied, and Kerkorian, who a few minutes before didn't know
what his name was or who was playing who, steps in to engineer the winning
touchdown drive. A Santa Clara back has run 47 yards and looks like he
might go all the way, when Jack Rye arrests him from behind and saves
Stanford from defeat. Ron Cook or Harry Hugasian are apparently stopped
after a few yards gain when suddenly Norm Manoogian or John Broderick
lower the boom on an opposition tackier, and a precious first down is made.
Possibly the greatest come-through performances are by the coaching
staff. They work until the wee hours in the morning figuring devices for
beating the next opponent. As a matter of fact, Chuck Taylor has a record
of only coming through. In 21 games as head coach (16 with the frosli.
five with the varsity), he has not yet lost a contest.
And so even though Rice, Calfee, Southwood, and possibly Cone are out
of this Saturday's encounter and Washington should be favored, let's
keep our fingers crossed for the come-through outfit that may be the Cin
derella team of the coast.
HARD LUCK STORY. Dick Lucas, first string guard last year, con
tracted bronchitis during spring practice, and was told to take it easy until
fall. He returned to fall practice in good health, then got a cold. The cold
brought back the bronchitis condition, and Dr. Stan Lordeaux advised Lucas
to rest up again. After several weeks Lucas appeared in good shape and
was all ready to help the team, when he suffered a concussion in practice and
was told to hang up the cleats for good.

by a comfortable margin, they just squeak by, and when they're supposed
to lose, they whale the daylight out of the opposition.
Stanford doesn't have the type of team that bowls an opponent over, but
somehow or other they always manage to come through in the clutch. In
three of the five victories, the Cards have been scored on first. In the other
two, they were tied and in considerable trouble. But great come-through
performances have won for the Indians. Here are some examples:
Bob Meyers gets injured, and a trackman who's only played two minutes
of college ball steps in and scores four touchdowns in two games, giving
forth the same type of performance that won him the Olympic decathalon
title at the age of 17. Things look bad, and then a guy named McColl leaps
a country mile into the air to snag a long pass, shaking off three defenders.
The score is tied, and Kerkorian, who a few minutes before didn't know
what his name was or who was playing who, steps in to engineer the winning
touchdown drive. A Santa Clara back has run 47 yards and looks like he
might go all the way, when Jack Rye arrests him from behind and saves
Stanford from defeat. Ron Cook or Harry Hugasian are apparently stopped
after a few yards gain when suddenly Norm Manoogian or John Broderick
lower the boom on an opposition tackier, and a precious first down is made.
Possibly the greatest come-through performances are by the coaching
staff. They work until the wee hours in the morning figuring devices for
beating the next opponent. As a matter of fact, Chuck Taylor has a record
of only coming through. In 21 games as head coach (16 with the frosli.
five with the varsity), he has not yet lost a contest.
And so even though Rice, Calfee, Southwood, and possibly Cone are out
of this Saturday's encounter and Washington should be favored, let's
keep our fingers crossed for the come-through outfit that may be the Cin
derella team of the coast.
HARD LUCK STORY. Dick Lucas, first string guard last year, con
tracted bronchitis during spring practice, and was told to take it easy until
fall. He returned to fall practice in good health, then got a cold. The cold
brought back the bronchitis condition, and Dr. Stan Lordeaux advised Lucas
to rest up again. After several weeks Lucas appeared in good shape and
was all ready to help the team, when he suffered a concussion in practice and
was told to hang up the cleats for good.

And so Southern Cal proved that Cal isn't superhuman.
We nw know thai the Bear gridders get up in the morning. Just like
everyone else. They put their shoes on and break bread three times a day.
They are human, not invincible'robots who do nothing but win football
games. We also know that when the first six left guards are injured that
the seventh string left euard can't step in and be just as adept as the first.

And just as we found out that Cal
can be beaten, we also learned that
the Blundering Herd is now the
Thundering Herd. Jess Hill may
have the most despised lot of gridders
on the Coast, but he also has the team
most likely to be in the Rose Bowl on
the first of January. Those of you
who are on the Stanford bandwagon
better hang on real tight around the
corners, because it's going to be tough
sledding from here on in.
Most of the guys on the team were
pulling for Cal to win, because now
that the Trojans have triumphed,
they will be very difficult to keep

away from Pasadena. SC has only two more conference games-—Stanford
and UCLA. Stanford, on the other hand, has Washington, Washington State,
Oregon State, Southern Cal, and Cal. Not a breather in the lot.
The experts say that the Cards will be doing very well to even win three
of those. And we are inclined to agree that if Chuck Taylor can guide the
Indians through that Herculean schedule unscathed it will be one of the
greatest come-through efforts in PCC history. Certainly, the tip-off will
be this week at Washington. If Stanford can get by the Huskies, they could
conceivably go all the way. But take it from the scouts, Washington is
loaded from stem to stern.
And yet, somehow we put a lot of faith in that great gang of guys who
knock hell out of each other from 4 p.m. to (J p.m. five times a week. They

keep our fingers crossed for the come-through outfit that may be the Cin
derella team of the coast.
HARD LUCK STORY. Dick Lucas, first string guard last year, con
tracted bronchitis during spring practice, and was told to take it easy until
fall. He returned to fall practice in good health, then got a cold. The cold
brought back the bronchitis condition, and Dr. Stan Lordeaux advised Lucas
to rest up again. After several weeks Lucas appeared in good shape and
was all ready to help the team, when he suffered a concussion in practice and
was told to hang up the cleats for good.
