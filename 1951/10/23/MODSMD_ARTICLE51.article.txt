# Troy Shoivs Power in Downing Bears
## 
### GORDON McKIBBEN Daily Editor 
USC's rough, tough, and slightly
dirty Trojans wiped up the field
with the proud Golden Bear Satur
day to score a decisive 21-14 win.
The first half ended with Cal |
ahead 14-0, thanks only to USC
fumbles and several unnecessary !
roughness penalties.
The second half saw SC stomp
the "invincible Bear" myth to !
tiny pieces. Led by Frank Gif
ford and a crew of hard-hitting i
and fast-moving backs, the Tro
jans chomped off yardage in three
unstoppable drives.
As for Cal, the Olszewski-less j
Bears were lucky to make a first
down. Time and again the SC
forwards trapped Billy Mais for 1
lon/» losses.
Pat Cannamela, the controversial
Trojan linebacker, was great. He !
made tackles on all sides, and they
were hard, definite tackles. He'll be
a tough man for Stanford to handle.
All the Trojans are rough.
Whether they pile on before or after
the whistle is a moot point, but it's
a cinch they pile on. Cannamela is
also an expert at tackling pass re
ceivers well out of bounds and well
after the whistle has blown.

The loss of Johnny Olszewski j
hurt the Bears a lot, and it also j
showed they are weak in backfield
reserves. There wasn't a good Cal
runner on the field after Olszewski
left.
i Stanford line coach Joe Ruetz,
| who scouted the game with back
field coach George Lynn, was im
pressed with the speed of USC's
; backs.
In commenting on Cannamela, j
! Ruetz said the SC star had all the
better of Les Richter in the line
j backers' duel. Ruetz said that he |
j "learned a lot" about both teams. ]
One little Cal student—he looked
j like a broken-hearted soph — was \

shaking with anger. He shouted ob
scenities at the Trojan rooters from
the press box, while Governor War
ren stood smiling as ever and chat
ting with two of his daughters only
a few feet away. The Cal boy cooled
off a bit when Ruetz grabbed him
by the arm and told him to watch it.
But for the most part the Cal stu
dents were just quiet.
