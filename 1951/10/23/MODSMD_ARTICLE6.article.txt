WASHINGTON â€” President Tru- j
man is eager to give Gen. Mark W. '
Clark an immediate recess appoint- I
ment as the nation's first ambassa- ,
dor to the Vatican, but probably |
will be thwarted by an 80-year-old
law, it was disclosed today.
The stumbling block to a recess j
appointment, which would permit '
Clark to serve in the Papal post I
without waiting for the return of
Congress in January, is an 1870 law
which bans military men on active
duty from holding civilian govern- j
ment posts.
