### 
With the stage set and the actors I
in their positions, the call of "cur- I
r-tain" will start the players mov- !
ing around the inner patio of "The j"
House of Bernarda Alba," opening i
tomorrow night.
Evelyn McCurdy is to play the
part of the rebellious younger
daughter of Bernarda. with David
Hawes directing. The play will run
from Wednesday through Saturday
nights at the Little Theater.
The setting, designed by Wendell
Cole of the Stanford speech and
drama staff, will be the inner patio l
and emphasizes the atmosphere of ;
the home of Bernarda Alha. The |
simple patio combines the warmth
of Spanish architecture and rome of
the cold and domineering quality of
the matriarch Bernarda.
The setting has the special prob
lem of requiring seven entrances
into the various rooms of the fam
ily of eight, and the archway lead
ing to the enclosed patio which is |
the only space allowed the five
daughters of Bernarda.
The lighting design of Gerald Le-
Grand contrasts the scorching heat
of the outdoors and the subdued at- j
mosphere of the inside.
The costumes by Hugo Mechionc
stress the prevailing mood of gloom
and the environment of severity, j
They represent a free adaptation of |
Spanish dress with emphasis on i
character rather than period.
Tickets to this first of the season i
production are priced at 00 cents '
and may be obtained at the Stan- 1
ford Memorial Auditorium box of
fice and at the Peninsula Box Of
fice. The performance will be at ;
