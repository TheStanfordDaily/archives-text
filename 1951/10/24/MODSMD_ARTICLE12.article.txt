Friday night horror movie, Drive
Chairman Eleanor Yancey empha
sized. The movie will close the
five-day drive.

j Tickets for the Friday night movie
I will be sold for 50 cents at the booth
in front of the Cellar starting Mon
j day. The horror film will be shown

do benefit," she emphasized.
The Community Chest and the
Cancer Society were chosen to rc
| ceive the money collected in the fall
