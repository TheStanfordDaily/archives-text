# 'Champion United Nations,' Sterling Urges, as Campus Hails Sixth UN Day
## Sterling Sees UN Progress 
### 
President I. E. Wallace Ster
ling issued the following state
ment yesterday in conjunction
with the sixth anniversary of the
UN Charter to be celebrated to- j
day.
"The United Nations Charter was
based, among other things, upon a |
major assumption: that the Great j
Powers, who have a permanent seat \
on the Security Council, would co- |
operate. This assumption has been j
invalidated by events as reflected in |
the so-called cold war.
"This invalidation has been dis
appointing, but it has by no means
destroyed the United Nations;
rather has it severely tested the i
organization; the test has been
taken with high marks.
"Too frequently in human affairs
we are more readily impressed with
items of failure than with items of
success. But. sensible evaluation in- i
volves the achieving of a balance be- i
tween the two. In balance the United I
Nations has made progress toward
its objectives and is to be commanded i
therefore.
"Those of us who champion de
mocracy, intelligently and with ,
conviction, are aware of its im
perfections. But these do not slack- '
en our effort to improve the opera
tion of our democracy.
"There i.s no inconsistency in rec- !
ognizing the weakness of the United
Nations and, at the same time, j
championing its purpose. And this.
I believe, we should do."
