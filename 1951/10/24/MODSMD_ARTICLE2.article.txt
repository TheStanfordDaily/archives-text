# Egyptians Riot
## 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt, Oct. 2:iâ€”Chants of
"lying live Russia" rang through
the shuttered streets of Cairo to
day as Egyptian police used tear gas
bombs and fired over the heads of
crowds to control riotous anti-Brit
ish demonstrations.
Large detachments of police were
rushed to the American and British
embassies to prevent attacks by
thousands of demonstrating stu
dents and laborers who shouted de
mands for arms and revolution.
The angry demonstrations swirled
through the streets of Cairo, Alex
andria, and the Canal Zone city of
Suez as Great Britain sealed the
disputed Suez Canal Zone to all
regular train traffic.
The British acted in reprisal for
Egypt's refusal to provide trains for
newly arrived troops, sent to the
Canal Zone to reinforce threatened
British garrisons.
