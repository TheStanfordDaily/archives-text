# A 						Few Thoughts on an Anniversary
## 
### 
As we listen to the carrillon and lectures to
day in celebration of the United Nations' sixth
anniversary, let us consider two things.
We have read or have been told abouj the
League of Nations. "It couldn't last long;
Doomed from the start," are its mournful epi
taphs. We know that the League failed for
many reasons. But do we remember that fol
lowing all the optimism which swept the
League into being, people quickly lost faith
in the assembly at Geneva and failed to stick
by it?
Today we have an organization that exceeds
the League in many ways—the UN is stronger,
many more nations are represented in its as
semblies, including the United States, and it
has men and women who are not afraid to pre
serve decency and peace at the same time. The
delegates who sit around its conference tables
are not mere idealists, but enlightened and real
istic individuals. We have had the opportunity
to hear from one of these men at Stanford. Any
one who heard Dr. Ralph Bunche speak last
year could not help having a stronger belief in
the UN, and confidence in its representatives,
such as this Nobel Peace Prize winner.

The United Nations has scored many achieve
ments in the last six years, which we should
neither overrate nor underrate. But the ten
dency seems to be in the latter direction. We
remember Gromyko's walkouts, the use of the
veto, and feel the tension of a cold war getting
hotter every day. We read about Korea, the
unrest in Egypt, Indo-China, and Pakistan, and
recklessly brush off the UN as another ineffec
tive attempt at peace. But what would it be
like without the UN? Would there be peace in
Palestine today; would we be limited to fight
ing the Communists in Korea; would Asia, with
the largest population of the world, be anything
but a massive army for tyrranical practices and
ideologies, rather than a group of countries
boldly reaching out for freedom?
There is no place for pessimism or foolish
optimism in today's and tomorrow's world.
What is needed is foresight and understanding.
We have an organization today which is our
only hope for making this world one in which
we can live. Let us not repeat the mistakes of
the 1920's whose consequences we have wit
nessed and suffered. We can not afford to lose
faith in the United Nations.—S.G.
