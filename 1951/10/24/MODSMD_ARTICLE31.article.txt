### DICK McLEAN 
THE COURSE OF ACTION
On Monday I presented my case against the present
foreign language requirement. Tuesday I suggested
some solutions. But in yesterday's list of solutions I
oinmitted one—the most important of all. It is action.
action this whole effort may well be for
„ nffifKjng. If you slww a lack of interest, it will lie
interpreted as a vote of negation. Is that what you
mean?

Action is the positive proof of
a belief. If you have read the two
previous articles and agreed with
the basic premise that a change in
the present foreign language re
quirement is necessary, then it is
your duty to speak up. If you
disagree, then defend your stand.
Hut you must admit that this is
an issue which must be thrashed
out.
Here is how you can act:

1) By writing letters to The Daily. This is perhaps
one of the best ways of voicing your feelings. Those
letters which are representative will be published.
But even more important than that, these letters in
number will be an accurate check on the campus
pulse. If the response is large, then the faculty will
know the student opinion one way or another. I
think this is going to be a surprisingly sharp issue
and you must take a side.
II lor these last three mornings you have agreed with
my basic point, then spend just a few minutes jotting
off a letter. Your time and three cent, stamp might
make Stanford an eyen better university for some
freshman. Or perhaps the neck you save may be
your own.
2) By talking to your Excom representatives. They
are your voice in how the school is run. It is they
who will present your wishes to the Lower Division

Scholarship Committee. Excom must judge how great
the student reaction is, pro and con. Every one of you
who expresses his wish to an excom member in
essence registers a vote.
Your class excom representatives are: Steve Blum
berg, '52; Chuck Silverberg, '53; Bill Fundenberg, '54
Dave Curry, graduate.
3) By asking the Student-Faculty Education Com
mission to begin an investigation of student reaction
to the present issue. It is the function of this group
to gather and present evidence in addition to pre
senting recommendations.
4) By petition which is t;ie last resort. If no suitabli
faculty action is taken, then a petition is in order. I 1
the informal means are ineffective, the formal mean
cannot be ignored. Petition is the big right aim of tht
student body. It :hould be saved like a ha>: ia':r.
punch in a prize fight. Right now I don't think it is
necessary. But if it should become so. treat it seriously.
Don't think that this issue has not been brought
up before. It has been the subject of much talk
within faculty meetings and planning committees.
Don't think that there aren't professors who are
aware of the rum'oiings and the cause thereof. The
noted Dean Faust, now with the Ford Foundation,
was all in favor of changes in the language require
ment. In short, it can be done.
My whole case hinges on the contention that the
students at large do not want the foreign language re
quirement as it now exists. Without positive support
from you in the form of action this series is but one
man's opinion. The effort to bring about a change
begins now with the last of these three Bull Sessions.
It begins with you. So if you really care, write your
letter to The Daily, talk to your excom representative,
await and demand faculty action. It is you who will
prove me right or wrong.
As Gary says to Harry every Saturday afternoon
when he slips him the football, "It's your ball. kid.
do what you want with it."
