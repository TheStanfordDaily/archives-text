Now that the preliminary games are over and the season half shot, we
find, unexpectedly, that the Indians are still unbeaten. But the loss of Gordy
Rice, Tsar Call'ee, Bob Meyers, Eric Southwood, Jesse Cone, Bob Griffin, and
a few others for a week or more at one time or another is a stiff price to pay.
It is partially for this reason plus a look at our remaining schedule that
we're practically giving away our Rose Bowl Tie. This is not to say, how
ever that we couldn't go all the way. We could!
The Indians have, in our estimation, potentially the best offensive unit
on the coast, even now vith all our injuries. Who can better the Kerkorian
to McColl pass coinbiir.il with the running of Mathias, Cook,
and Laubscher? That plus the best offensive line blocking we've seen
since we've been on the Farm.
True, our defense isn't the best in the West, but they have held our
opponents to less points than we've scored. The defensive squad, though,
has been the hardest hit injury-wise, and if some new talent isn't uncovered
before long, parts of the offense will have to go both ways. This, in turn,
could weaken the offensive strength.
However, the catalyst in the Card potentiality seems to be that intangible
thing that coaches are so hard put to handle. Attitude! These Indian gridders
are the weirdest bunch we've seen in many a moon when it comes to attitude.
To date they've only been able to put enough heart into the game to win
and no more.
For example: The week before the UCLA game when they really
needed it, the players vVhipped themselves into that "do or die" attitude
with no trouble at all. And then they went out and played their best game
of the season against the Bruins, but still stuffed off at times.
Then last week Chuck Taylor had himself one hell of a ti.-ne trying to
convince his boys that Santa Clara was anything but a breather. Chuck's
a man who could do it, but it couldn't be done. He might have succeeded
i! the Cards hadn't scored against the Broncos the first time they laid their
hands on the ball.
Incidentally, some of our minor injuries, we believe, have been a direct
result of this half-hearted playing.
It all adds up to this: If the team can get and hold on to the attiludtc
that they are going to have to get out and for a full GO minutes play their
I,est ball game—and that means better than ever—for the next five Satur
days, they can wind up in the same spot they're now in—undefeated.
However, if they stick with the attitude that they can rest as long as they're
not behind, someone's going to walk all over them before they wake up.
We'll have to add a couple of big provisions, though. They'll need as
many good breaks as they've been getting, and injuries will have to be
minimized. These are the tilings the team has little control over, and are the
big reasons why our Rose Bowl tie is so cheap.
Till: MAN WE'VE TAKEN FOR GRANTED DEPARTMENT—"Take
the case of the young Charley Justice, add a dash of the Doak Walker
stampede and llavor with Vic Janowicz when he was an Ohio schoolboy
. ensation —and you have what at first glance appear to be the ingredients
of the Bill McColl story. Then throw them all away. Stanford's 21-year-old
AU-American end with the Herculean build and the deadliest pass-catch
ing hooks in Far Western history is a man set apart among football stars."
This is the way Al Stump begins his article, "Bill McColl. Lineman
Deluxe," in the November issue of Sport Magazine, and what we believe
is the finest sports story on a player we've ever read.
No doubt everyone has sat in the stands every Saturday and said to him
:,i-!f, "Wait'll Gary tostes one to Bill, and everything will be all right."
Everyone has just naturally taken Bill for granted without giving it much
more thought. That's why we highly recommend this article, for it's the real
McColl. It gives you the story behind the story, to use a trite phrase, deal
ing with everything from his Scottish ancestry down to his aspirations for
medicine.
Wishing to know all these amazing facts about Stanford's All-Ameri
can football player as well as med student, we went directly to the source,
Big Bill himself, and asked him. "Yes," said McColl thoughtfully, "the
fact's are all true." Then came a statement wg expected to hear from him.
"The superlatives, though, are exaggerated," grinned Bill. "This running
over people and stuff. You know how sports writers love to play up those
things." We allowed that we knew and grinned back.
In our book, the article is a great story on a great guy.
