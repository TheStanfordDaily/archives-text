# Passing Is Stressed In Scrimmage
## 
### 
The stress was on passing yes
terday as Bill McColl was his usual
All-American self . . . glomming
passes right and left.
Bob Meyers suited up and was
running at full speed. Guard Jesse
Cone was working out, although he
still favors his ailing knee. Bob
Bryan seemed to be back in top
shape as did tackle Barry Smith.
Tackle Dick Gant and guard Bob
Griffin aren't coming around as ex
pected, however.
The offense was given some new
plays to throw against Washington,
while the defense scrimmaged
against Husky plays. The Braves
emulated Washington.
Chuck Taylor ordered the lights
turned on and worked his team
until 6:20. Looking good in blocking
were Jim Vick, Norm Manoogian,
John Broderiek, and Jack Bonetti.
Although reports have it that Don
Heinrich, Washington's Ail-Ameri
can quarterback, hasn't been up to
his 1950 form on the short passes.
Washington will throw plenty of
passes, with Heinrich the chucker.
Sam Williams, Heinrich's under
study, is currently the second lead
ing passer in the PCC and Husky
coach Howie Odell must feel Hein
rich is more than ready if he has
named him to start against the
Cards.
Last year Heinrich turned in one
of the greatest passing exhibitions
ever seen in the Stanford Stadium
as he completed 19 out of 24 passes
for 247 yards.
