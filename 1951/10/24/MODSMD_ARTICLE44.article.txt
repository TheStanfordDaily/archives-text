# BRONCS NO BREATHERS
## 
### 
j The last - minute triumph Stan
i lord gained over Santa Clara last
Saturday kept up the tradition of
close Indian-Bronc struggles. The
most "one-sided" game in the last
six contests played was in 1948
when the Broncos rolled to a 27-14
victory. All the rest (excluding a
; tie in 1949) were decided by one
j touchdown.
