# TV Blamed for Attendance Drops
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Football filberts who eagerly had
j anticipated a full menu of grid tel
i ecasts this fall were more than just
a little disappointed last spring
when the NCAA ruled that there
would be no "live" football tele
casting, with the exception of a few
scattered experimental games.
Protests were loud and long from
hopeful armchair quarterbacks, as
well as from sponsors v/ho wanted
to continue blurring their adver
tisements into homes via the media
of television and the game of foot-
I bali.
Perfectly natural are the protests
I of fans, many of whom went out
and bought a receiver just to be
J able to sit in a warm living room,
drink in hand, and watch their fa
vorite team in action by way of the
I electronic keyhole.

; Ami why (his linn? Well, (he
answer is one (hat is clear to all
our hearts and revolves around
the almighty dollar. College foot
ball attendance dropped percep
tibly in 1!)5() and although it
dropped generally, it fell off most
in TV areas, and significantly,
gains were recorded in non-TV
areas. On the local scene Stan
ford, which had a full telecasting
sked last season, si ffercd a drop
in attendance of 31.4 pin* cent,
I although it must be kept in mind
that 15 per cent of this loss can
i be attributed to the Big Game
being played at Berkeley.
Because football receipts at the
average school, which includes
Stanford, support 72 per cent of the
entire varsity and intramural ath
letic program, the National Colle
i giate Athletic Association, not want

ing to see men denied athletic com- i
; petition in college, stepped in be- j
| lore TV damaged receipts to such ;
'an extent that schools would be j
; forced to cut their athletic budget.
However, the NCAA has taken 1
| action, and now, under laboratory i
I controlled conditions, is telecasting
' 19 games throughout the season and
' throughout the nation.
\ A 1 Masters, director of athletics '
j at Stanford, thinks the most logical j
j plan is Phonevision, which is a sys- j
tern where the viewer rents a spe- J
cial decoder which translates unin
; ielligible transmission waves into a i
defined picture. The cost per game |
per receiver could be set at a dol
lar. This would raise a sum suffi
j cient to cover any gate losses of the
competing schools as well as to pay
| the operators of Phonevision. Spon- ;
I sors woulJ also chip in their bit.
