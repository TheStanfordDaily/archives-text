# Sadie's Hot Voice Lures Men
## 
### HERB SEITER 
According to legend, there sits
on a certain rock on the Rhine
River a young lady called Die
Loreli, who lures boatmen away
from the channel and onto the
rocks, with her singing. At Stan
(ford, Die. Loreli has her counter
part. Here, Stanford Sadie lures
male students away from their
books and onto the scholastic
i rocks.
About the only thing that saves
the Stanford rough from total de
j struction is the fact that Sadie only
broadcasts one-half hour a week.
The fatal time on KZSU is from
10:30 to 11 every Monday evening.
If Sadie were considered a
freshman when she first started
broadcasting on KZSU, she would
be well into graduate study hy
now. And, like anv college girl,
Sadie has changed dnring her
time at Stanford.
Over the years Sadie's technique
has moved from a somewhat bois
terous, abrupt freshman attitude to
the smooth, sophisticated, and subt
ly suggestive style she uses today
to lure men away from their arts
and sciences.
While the Sadie tradition is con
tinuous and grows from year to
year, the girl who takes the part of
Sadie changes every quarter.' When
tryouts are held the first week of

each quarter, there Ls severe com
petition between coeds for the part,
and the choice goes to the girl who
has the most warmly seductive
voice.
The identity of Sadie remains a
secret from the moment she is cho
sen until the last broadcast of the
quarter, when she reveals her true
identity to the radio audience. Ex
tremely careful measures are taken
to keep this identity unknown.
While many attempts have been
made to discover who Sadie is, she
hps never been discovered. One
time a number of freshmen from
Encina raided the KZSU studios
during the broadcast, and forced
their way in hy sheer weight of
numbers, only to find three differ
ent girls all reading the same script
into three different microphones.
Another time a group of freshmen
planned a raid on the studio but
their plot was discovered. When
they bioke into the studio Sadie
was nowhere to be seen. She was
speaking from a distant part of the
campus via a remote line.
For over a year no major at
tempt has been made to discover
Sadie's identity. The consensus of
opinion among KZSU stafT mem
bers is that the freshmen, who
formerly gave Sadie no end of
trouble, are now thoroughly con
vinced that no matter what they
do to discover Sadie's secret, the

staiT of (ho station is one Mrp
ahead of them.
So the Stanford rough will have
to be contcnt to allow Sadie to re
main a mystery woman until the
end of the quarter. However, he
can listen to her every Monday,
and wonder who it 1* who one week
says, "You'd better turn the radio
down, or I might melt the tubes,"
then conies back the next week
with, "Turn the radio up a little
louder, honey, so I can get closer
to you."

quarter, when she reveals her true
identity to the radio audience. Ex
tremely careful measures are taken
to keep this identity unknown.
While many attempts have been
made to discover who Sadie is, she
hps never been discovered. One
time a number of freshmen from
Encina raided the KZSU studios
during the broadcast, and forced
their way in hy sheer weight of
numbers, only to find three differ
ent girls all reading the same script
into three different microphones.
Another time a group of freshmen
planned a raid on the studio but
their plot was discovered. When
they bioke into the studio Sadie
was nowhere to be seen. She was
speaking from a distant part of the
campus via a remote line.
For over a year no major at
tempt has been made to discover
Sadie's identity. The consensus of
opinion among KZSU stafT mem
bers is that the freshmen, who
formerly gave Sadie no end of
trouble, are now thoroughly con
vinced that no matter what they
do to discover Sadie's secret, the

staiT of (ho station is one Mrp
ahead of them.
So the Stanford rough will have
to be contcnt to allow Sadie to re
main a mystery woman until the
end of the quarter. However, he
can listen to her every Monday,
and wonder who it 1* who one week
says, "You'd better turn the radio
down, or I might melt the tubes,"
then conies back the next week
with, "Turn the radio up a little
louder, honey, so I can get closer
to you."
According to legend, there sits
on a certain rock on the Rhine
River a young lady called Die
Loreli, who lures boatmen away
from the channel and onto the
rocks, with her singing. At Stan
(ford, Die. Loreli has her counter
part. Here, Stanford Sadie lures
male students away from their
books and onto the scholastic
i rocks.
About the only thing that saves
the Stanford rough from total de
j struction is the fact that Sadie only
broadcasts one-half hour a week.
The fatal time on KZSU is from
10:30 to 11 every Monday evening.
If Sadie were considered a
freshman when she first started
broadcasting on KZSU, she would
be well into graduate study hy
now. And, like anv college girl,
Sadie has changed dnring her
time at Stanford.
Over the years Sadie's technique
has moved from a somewhat bois
terous, abrupt freshman attitude to
the smooth, sophisticated, and subt
ly suggestive style she uses today
to lure men away from their arts
and sciences.
While the Sadie tradition is con
tinuous and grows from year to
year, the girl who takes the part of
Sadie changes every quarter.' When
tryouts are held the first week of

each quarter, there Ls severe com
petition between coeds for the part,
and the choice goes to the girl who
has the most warmly seductive
voice.
