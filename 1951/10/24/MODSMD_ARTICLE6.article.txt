# New York Dock Strike

NEW YORK â€” Industrial leaders
urged President Truman today to
declare a state of emergency and
end a wildcat strike which has
closed the Port of New York "100
per cent" as the Army advertised
for stevedores to move vital mili
tary cargoes.
Earlier, CIO Maritime Union sea
men clamped a double-lock on the
harbor by promising to refuse to
sail ships from any pier picketed by
the wildcat strikers.
