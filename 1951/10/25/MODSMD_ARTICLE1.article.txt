## Churchill to Try Come-back Today 
### 
l/)NDON. Thursday, Oct. 25 (I P) i
—British voters were expected to \
turn out in record numbers today in
a national election that will decide
whether Winston Churchill will win ;
his last bid to become Prime Min- J
ister.
Final pre - election betting odds ]
and. public opinion polls established!
Churchill's Conservative party as a j
slight favorite shortly before the j
opening of the polls at 7 a.m. (5 a.m.
PST).
The voting is for election of mem
bers of a new 625-seat Parliament.
The last election, in February, 1950, I
ended in a virtual stalemate, with
a Labor majority of only six.
Election weather forecasts said,
"Sunny in most places after patches
of fog in the morning." Both parties
were appealing for a heavy vote and
both contended that good weather j
would help.
It was almost certainly Church
ill's last bid for power. He will be I
77 next month. Denounced by La- ;
borites and Communists as a war
monger, he gave the He to such
"rruel and ungrateful" accusations j
and said that this election would be j
his last prize—a chance to help as- j
r.iire peace for another generation, j
Attlee conducted a quiet cam- j
paign. He stuck to domestic issues, I
telling scores of small crowds what j
his party had done for the people j
in the six years since the war and j
charging that, a Conservative vie- :
tory would mean a return to unem- j
ployment.
