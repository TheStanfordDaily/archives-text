# Funds Drive Opens Monday
## 
### 
The fall all-campus charity drive,
the only one of the quarter, will last
from Monday through Friday next
week.
The Palo Alto Community Chest
will receive 60 per cent of the do
nations, the American Cancer So
ciety 40 per cent. No over-all quota
has been set up; instead, an indi
vidual donation quota will be an
nounced before the drive begins.
New Policy
A new policy of cutting down on
the number of money - seeking
events will be tried out this fall,
chairman Elinor Yancey explained.
Living group soliciting and a Fri
day night horror movie will be the
only methods used.
Living group representatives will
turn in money daily next week,
starting Monday. The horror film
will be shown three times—at 7, 9,
and 11 p.m.—in Cubberley Audito
rium. Tickets will be sold next
week for 50 cents at a table in front
of the Cellar.
Recipients Chosen
The Cancer Society and the Palo
Alto Community Chest were chosen
as the drive's recipients by the
Drives Committee, an advisory
group set up by Excom last fall.
Before choosing the two organiza
tions, the committee investigated
the ways in which the money would
be spent.
The Cancer Society spends its
funds both for research and actual
hospital aid. The eight Community
Chest member agencies arc the
Stanford YWCA, Palo Alto YWCA
and YMCA, Palo Alto Girl Scouts
and Boy Scouts, Family Service As
sociation, Youth Co - ordinating
Council, and United Defense Funds.
Because part of the Community
Chest comes back to Stanford, giv
ing to the drive is particularly sig
nificant, Miss Yancey pointed out.
