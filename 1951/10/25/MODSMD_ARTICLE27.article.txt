# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
THURSDAY MORNING JOTTINGS
I have u lot of campus items to throw your way
today, so as the fat man said as he was about to get on
the scale, "I think I'll be on my weigh."
A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH FOUR DATES
l.\ THE CACTUS GARDENS. A well-known man-

about-campus was working out
on the track the other day when
he saw a quail flit across the track,
and he caught it. An hour later,
this same man-about-campus was
at the Branner open house with
lite same quail. Several Branner
ites crowded around and "oh"ed
and "ah 'ed over the bird. When
they asked the man-about-cam
pus what he was going to do with
it.he calmly replied, "Kill it."

Thi:; prompted shreiks from the girls, all of whom
must have been members of the SPCA. but he had
a clever solution. He promised that the quail wouldn't
be harmed if the girls would makes dates with him.
In less time than it takes to say. "Listen to the mocking
bird," our man-about-campus had four dates. Spaced
at convenient intervals.
Later, he was in the Stern eating line, wearing a
frown. "What's the matter?" inquired one of the
hashers.
"This dinner," harrumped our man-about-campus, "is
strictly for the birds."
And with this he stuck in front of the bug-eyed
hasher's face the quail, who by this time was very
tired of playing straight man for our man-about-cam
pus.
I* * i)t
ORCHIDS DEFT. George Kammerer and the
ATO's deserve commendation for their changing
"hell week" to "help week." May more fraternities
follow suit.
I want to add my fullest approval to Dick !Yl<--
Lean's crusade for junking the medieval language
requirements. Student opinion is with him. although

I iust saw McLean running past the Cellar, dodging
copies of "Pensativa" and "Tovaritch" thrown by
Charles Ludlum (See letters to the Editor).

A KEG SIX AND A LOCOMOTIVE FOR THE K. j
OF F. About fifty Stanfordites, most of them under
21, were out at Rossotti's last Friday, happily guzzling j
beer at 4:21 p.m. At 4:22 p.m. a dark-complexioned i
man with a low-brimmed gray hat walked in. He j
passed among the students noiselessly, and at 4:35 p.m.
he announced to the assemblage that he was a mem- 1
ber of the Board of Equalization. At 4:36 p.m. all the j
beer was out of sight.
The B. of E. man then gave a lecture, stating the j
provisions of the new liquor law. NROTC students
were kissing their commissions good-bye; pre-law
students were contemplating becoming psych majors; |
and co-eds were trying to figure out how they were j
going to explain the misdemeanor on their record to '
their parents. The man in the low-brimmed gray hat
concluded his lecture by announcing, "Well, I won't i
turn you in this time. I'm just giving you a warning
about the next time."
The relieved Stanfordites gave fifteen cheers for
the B. of E. and a public demonstration followed.
At 4:12 p.m. the B. of E. man left, and at 4:4:5 p.m.
50 Stanford students were enjoying 50 cups of foam
ing brew.

THE PAUSE THAT REFRESHES. While on the
subject of liquor, one of the men's residences held an
exchange picnic with one of the women residences re
cently. Because of the new liquor regulation, eight
cases of cokes (24 bottles to a case) were ordered for •
the 100 participants. The provision was made that the !
kids "could get beer at their own risk" if they wished I
to.
Seven full cases of cokes were returned.
ATTENTION. MED STUDENTS. I don't want to
scare any of the pre-meds, but one of the first-year
rued students reports leaving his cadaver face up in
the evening and returning the next morning and find
ing it face down.

A KEG SIX AND A LOCOMOTIVE FOR THE K. j
OF F. About fifty Stanfordites, most of them under
21, were out at Rossotti's last Friday, happily guzzling j
beer at 4:21 p.m. At 4:22 p.m. a dark-complexioned i
man with a low-brimmed gray hat walked in. He j
passed among the students noiselessly, and at 4:35 p.m.
he announced to the assemblage that he was a mem- 1
ber of the Board of Equalization. At 4:36 p.m. all the j
beer was out of sight.
The B. of E. man then gave a lecture, stating the j
provisions of the new liquor law. NROTC students
were kissing their commissions good-bye; pre-law
students were contemplating becoming psych majors; |
and co-eds were trying to figure out how they were j
going to explain the misdemeanor on their record to '
their parents. The man in the low-brimmed gray hat
concluded his lecture by announcing, "Well, I won't i
turn you in this time. I'm just giving you a warning
about the next time."
The relieved Stanfordites gave fifteen cheers for
the B. of E. and a public demonstration followed.
At 4:12 p.m. the B. of E. man left, and at 4:4:5 p.m.
50 Stanford students were enjoying 50 cups of foam
ing brew.

THE PAUSE THAT REFRESHES. While on the
subject of liquor, one of the men's residences held an
exchange picnic with one of the women residences re
cently. Because of the new liquor regulation, eight
cases of cokes (24 bottles to a case) were ordered for •
the 100 participants. The provision was made that the !
kids "could get beer at their own risk" if they wished I
to.
Seven full cases of cokes were returned.
ATTENTION. MED STUDENTS. I don't want to

the evening and returning the next morning and find

A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH FOUR DATES
l.\ THE CACTUS GARDENS. A well-known man-

about-campus was working out
on the track the other day when
he saw a quail flit across the track,
and he caught it. An hour later,
this same man-about-campus was
at the Branner open house with
lite same quail. Several Branner
ites crowded around and "oh"ed
and "ah 'ed over the bird. When
they asked the man-about-cam
pus what he was going to do with
it.he calmly replied, "Kill it."

Thi:; prompted shreiks from the girls, all of whom
must have been members of the SPCA. but he had
a clever solution. He promised that the quail wouldn't
be harmed if the girls would makes dates with him.
In less time than it takes to say. "Listen to the mocking
bird," our man-about-campus had four dates. Spaced
at convenient intervals.
Later, he was in the Stern eating line, wearing a
frown. "What's the matter?" inquired one of the
hashers.
"This dinner," harrumped our man-about-campus, "is
strictly for the birds."
And with this he stuck in front of the bug-eyed
hasher's face the quail, who by this time was very
tired of playing straight man for our man-about-cam
pus.

cases of cokes (24 bottles to a case) were ordered for •
the 100 participants. The provision was made that the !
kids "could get beer at their own risk" if they wished I
to.
Seven full cases of cokes were returned.
ATTENTION. MED STUDENTS. I don't want to
scare any of the pre-meds, but one of the first-year
rued students reports leaving his cadaver face up in
the evening and returning the next morning and find
ing it face down.
