To the Editor:
I heartily agree with the series of articles in the
recent Bull Sessions on changing the present lower
division foreign language requirements. The sugges
tions are sound and well thought out.
Twenty-one units i.s a lot of time to devote to a
subject which many thoroughly detest, and which
serves no actual purpose in many cases. Good luck
on your campaign!
