To the Editor:
I am most grateful to the writer of Bull Session for
his lucid comments on language requirements. One
can recognize good thinking by the quality of lan
guage a writer uses; it is easy to see—at the dangle of
a participle—that our columnist is not going to let
any language, including his native tongue, stand in

his way. 1 should like to add emphasis to Bull Session
remarks of Monday, although Tuesday's droppings
are almost as pungent.
1. The students object to the requirement. Good
argument! Alter all. colleges exist for the students,
and professors should learn more from them. I, too,
yearn for the day when age and experience can be
replaced in the professor's chair by "well-rounded"
youth.
2. "Well-roundedness" properly belongs here. The
object of a liberal education is certainly to perform
this feat of sculpture. For if the object were to induce
thinking, we should have to think in some language,
and learning to think in any language is hard and not
round.
3. This point—if no language were required, every
body would flock to study a language—is well taken.
I suggest, however, an impiovement .Teachers of lan
guage should introduce juggling acts and talking dogs
into their classes—then patronage would really pick
up.
4. Finally. I should like to add to all this wisdom
by introducing a further refinement. Let us drop
the English language from the list of difficult subjects
we must master. I am reasonably confident that Dick
McLean would agree with me here: he himself has
apparently taken this step already.
