## 
### 
Editor's note: Huns Ross, was an exchange stu
dent last year under the ASSI! foreign scholarship
program. Now hack in Switzerland, he wrote the
following letter to The Daily.)
lIAIL STANFORD. HAIL! . . . FROM SWITZER
LAND.
As an ASSU foreign exchange student. I was at
Stanford, unfortunately, only during one football
quarter. I saw only eight games, but that was by far
• riough to become a fan. and I remain one.
Since my return to Switzerland. I have told count
less people about this wonderful game. I speak about
"tackling, the T-formation, the Left-Wing formation"
like an expert although I only have a faint idea of the
ecrets of football strategy. But since football is un
known over here, people believe me!
While speaking of football, of course, I never forget
to mention the pretty "pom-pom girls," the yell lead
ers. the Stanford band, and—l was terribly impressed!
that pass of All-American Bill McColl in the Big
Game. Unforgetable thrill!
Swiss people also enjoy sports very much. There
fore they follow my description of football attentively,
although they prefer to play soccer and ice hockey.
Above all they enjoy skiing.
When you realize how much I like football, you can
imagine how happy I was to have found out that the
radio station of the American Forces in Europe re
ports the results of football games every Sunday at
530 p.m. Each time I hear the scores I am excited
because Stanford is winning all the way. Michigan
and UCLA! The Big Red Machine is really rolling
tliis year!
Alter hearing the results, there is always a cele
bration in my room with the help of the long-playing
record ol "Stanford Songs." "Come Join the Band"
and Give Em the Axe" ring out often in my room.
My congratulations and good luck on the way to the

Rose Bowl!
But football is, of course, not the only thing I speak
about to the people here in Switzerland. I tell them
of all the other things at beautiful Stanford University.
(I wonder if ail the kids realize what a wonderful
Alma Mater they have.) I tell them of the friendlin jss,
hospitality, and generosity of the people on the Farm;
about the very fine courses and professors at Stanford;
about the gay social life and the pretty girls; and
sometimes I reminisce about Rossotti's, Dinah's, Chez
Yvonne, and L'Omelette. I am very thankful for the
year 1 spent at Stanford. It not only was an enormous
personal gain, but it game me the possibility to study
the American way of life. I am therefore more able
now to give people here in Switzerland a "real" picture
ot America. And people here are very interested in
the United States.
From this letter you can see that I am pretty darn
homesick for the Farm. There are several reasons for
it (one reason lives at Guthrie!). You can understand
how happy I was this summer when I saw several
Stanford people in Zurich I said hello to Evelyn
personal gain, but it gave me the possibility to study
Delts spent an evening at my home; and two good old
friends from the Delta Tan Delta. Gardy Walkup and
Jarv Gates, stayed in Zurich for three days. It was
good to see them all again.
A few days ago I came back from a tough Army
training camp in the mountains. The Swiss rearma
ment program has been in full swing since 1947.
Switzerland is rearming without any foreign help
whatsoever. Today this country of four and a half
million people would be ready to mobilize a well
trained and fully equipped army of 750.000 men within
three days.
Well, I guess I have to close for this time. My very
best regards to all my dear friends in Stanford, es
pecially to the Delts, the Theta Xi's, and the Alpha
Delts. I spent a wonderful year in their houses.
