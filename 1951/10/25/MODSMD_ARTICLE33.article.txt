# Chappie Back; Humor Elsewhere Still Gagged
## 
### WALT MENNINGER 
Well, the Old Boy's back, but taking a hop, skip, and a jump
look over some other college humor mags, the situation in gen
eral isn't so rosy.
On three West Coast campuses, the humor magazines are pres
ently "discontinued" for various reasons, and 011 other campuses

the position of the funny mags is
I precarious.
| Lust year's Chappie suspension
1 and also the Harvard Lampoon par
ody issue, the "Pontoon," which was
i banned from the mails, point out
the precariousness of the situation
in which many of the outstanding
| magazines now find themselves.
Wampus Out
This year both the USC Wampus
and the Washington State College
; Fo-Paws were discontinued, not be
| cause of moral reasons but prima
rily as the result of financial prob
lems. it seems that a humor maga
i zine on either the USC or WSC
I campus is a losing proposition.
The Wampus did not bow out
| without some comment, however, as
1 the USC Daily Trojan carried a
j complete resume of the final hours,
j After a 32-year-reign on the SC
j campus, the Wampus last semester
I was criticized considerably by anti
| Wampus factions for • being "lewd,
j lascivious, and a disgrace to the
| university."
The reason for the discontinu
-1 ~
ance was attributed to a drop in
circulation resulting from dwindling
! student interest in addition to the
i recent university budget cut (the
■ Wampus was subsidized).
Kansas University, however, saw
I its first humor publication since
' World War II when the revamped
Sour Owl went on sale last week.
Off and on through the years, KU
! has seen two competing funny mags,
the Owl and the Bitter Bird, but
both were suspended in 1946 on
moral grounds.
On other campuses the magazines
are leading a usual life, The Uni
versity of Washington Columns and
the Cai Pelican are both coming out
on schedule.
