It was going to be easy. We were all set to say that if Stanford beat Wash
ington the Indians would go undefeated, and then USC went to the trouble
of whipping California. We had to reconsider and after many hours of mental
strife, we still come up with Stanford to go undefeated if they yet by
Washington Saturday.
We can't help but think that beating Washington at Seattle, on a
possible wet field, and without the services of Gordy Rice. Eric South
wood, and the limited duty of Jesse Cone, will be a lot tougher than
trouncing the 'Irojans in the usual friendly Los Angeles Coliseum come
November 10.
USC PLAYS CADETS BEFORE CARDS
Looking ahead we note that the week before USC plays host to the In
dians. the Trojans travel back to New York to play the once-mighty Army.
Nov/ it isn't that the Cadets are going to be much of an opponent, but an
Army team always plays rough, tough football.
More important is the fact that the game is being played in the big city.
Not only does the city itself have a great training temptation, but the amount
of time in travel raises havoc with practice schedules. Another factor is that
barring further injuries Stanford should be at full strength, only missing
Rice and Tsar Calfec for the Trojan struggle.
And if we do get by Washington and USC, what about California? Why,
they are just a big Lad bunch of hears who've been getting fat on lainli.
We said two weeks ago, after seeing the Minnesota game, that C'al could be
had by the ri»ht team. USC proved it. Washington could beat thcin, and
Stanford should beat them.
There's the question of Washington State and Oregon State. But if
Stanford plays the ball that it is capable of playing, the Cougars and the
Beavers will be beaten.
So here we are half way through the madness of another grid season,
and we are stepping out on the proverbial limb and picking Stanford to
go undefeated if they get by Washington this week. As for the Washington
game, heads you w in. tails you lose. It's a toss-up.
ABILITY ISN'T ALWAYS MOST IMPORTANT
It seems a pity that you need more than ability to make Ail-American.
For if All-American honors were granted on statistics and game showings
alone, and not on advance publicity and fanfare, Stanford would be'boasting
another All-American in Gary Kerkorian.
Kerkorian's passing and play-calling has been excellent. Granted that
McColl is tops, but who's been putting the ball where he can get to it, or
even close to it? Who has been setting the plays where McColl for so long
sets as decoy and then suddenly springs to life when most needed? Why,
it's one Mr. Kerkorian. McColl and Kerkorian together are an Ail-American
duo.
Kerkorian is a cinch to make All-Coast, but had the local press been
more observing, they would have seen in the last Big Game that Kerkorian
had come into his own. It is between seasons with rave notices and public
ity that the most is done towards making an All-American and somehow
(lie press missed the boat on Kerkorian.
Speaking of greats, we believe that Jack Rye and Ron Eadie are a pair
of the finest defensive ends on the Coast and the most underrated. It was
Rye who last week overtook the flying Hank Burget on the Stanford 17 to
prevent the Santa Clara go-ahead tally in the fourth quarter. And all season
it has been Eadie and Rye who have been rushing passers off their feet
and who have been stingy with yardage around their flanks. .
WHAT ABOUT A DIVIDED ROOTING SECTION?
Note to Rally Com: How about a divided rooting section when we go
down South? It seems that the men are just a little freer and yell just a bit
louder and with more enthusiasm when women aren't close by to gaze with
ill feeling upon emotional outbursts which seem to interrupt their chatter
as to who is wearing what, and there's so and so. And sometimes these out
bursts aren't in language pleasant to the ear, especially the feminine ear.
There's the retort that Stanford men are gentlemen and are not supposd
to say nasty things. But nevertheless they sometimes do. And in a tight
game, as the USC game promises to be, the lip often overrules the head.
So, let's have a separate men's and women's section where there'll be no red
faces but rather a loud sounding, spirited rooting section.

another All-American in Gary Kerkorian.
Kerkorian's passing and play-calling has been excellent. Granted that
McColl is tops, but who's been putting the ball where he can get to it, or
even close to it? Who has been setting the plays where McColl for so long
sets as decoy and then suddenly springs to life when most needed? Why,
it's one Mr. Kerkorian. McColl and Kerkorian together are an Ail-American
duo.
Kerkorian is a cinch to make All-Coast, but had the local press been
more observing, they would have seen in the last Big Game that Kerkorian
had come into his own. It is between seasons with rave notices and public
ity that the most is done towards making an All-American and somehow
(lie press missed the boat on Kerkorian.
Speaking of greats, we believe that Jack Rye and Ron Eadie are a pair
of the finest defensive ends on the Coast and the most underrated. It was
Rye who last week overtook the flying Hank Burget on the Stanford 17 to
prevent the Santa Clara go-ahead tally in the fourth quarter. And all season
it has been Eadie and Rye who have been rushing passers off their feet
and who have been stingy with yardage around their flanks. .
WHAT ABOUT A DIVIDED ROOTING SECTION?
Note to Rally Com: How about a divided rooting section when we go
down South? It seems that the men are just a little freer and yell just a bit
louder and with more enthusiasm when women aren't close by to gaze with
ill feeling upon emotional outbursts which seem to interrupt their chatter
as to who is wearing what, and there's so and so. And sometimes these out
bursts aren't in language pleasant to the ear, especially the feminine ear.
There's the retort that Stanford men are gentlemen and are not supposd
to say nasty things. But nevertheless they sometimes do. And in a tight
game, as the USC game promises to be, the lip often overrules the head.
So, let's have a separate men's and women's section where there'll be no red
faces but rather a loud sounding, spirited rooting section.
It was going to be easy. We were all set to say that if Stanford beat Wash
ington the Indians would go undefeated, and then USC went to the trouble
of whipping California. We had to reconsider and after many hours of mental
strife, we still come up with Stanford to go undefeated if they yet by
Washington Saturday.
We can't help but think that beating Washington at Seattle, on a
possible wet field, and without the services of Gordy Rice. Eric South
wood, and the limited duty of Jesse Cone, will be a lot tougher than
trouncing the 'Irojans in the usual friendly Los Angeles Coliseum come
November 10.
USC PLAYS CADETS BEFORE CARDS
Looking ahead we note that the week before USC plays host to the In
dians. the Trojans travel back to New York to play the once-mighty Army.
Nov/ it isn't that the Cadets are going to be much of an opponent, but an
Army team always plays rough, tough football.
More important is the fact that the game is being played in the big city.
Not only does the city itself have a great training temptation, but the amount
of time in travel raises havoc with practice schedules. Another factor is that
barring further injuries Stanford should be at full strength, only missing
Rice and Tsar Calfec for the Trojan struggle.
And if we do get by Washington and USC, what about California? Why,
they are just a big Lad bunch of hears who've been getting fat on lainli.
We said two weeks ago, after seeing the Minnesota game, that C'al could be
had by the ri»ht team. USC proved it. Washington could beat thcin, and
Stanford should beat them.
There's the question of Washington State and Oregon State. But if
Stanford plays the ball that it is capable of playing, the Cougars and the
Beavers will be beaten.
So here we are half way through the madness of another grid season,
and we are stepping out on the proverbial limb and picking Stanford to
go undefeated if they get by Washington this week. As for the Washington
game, heads you w in. tails you lose. It's a toss-up.
ABILITY ISN'T ALWAYS MOST IMPORTANT
It seems a pity that you need more than ability to make Ail-American.
For if All-American honors were granted on statistics and game showings
alone, and not on advance publicity and fanfare, Stanford would be'boasting
another All-American in Gary Kerkorian.
Kerkorian's passing and play-calling has been excellent. Granted that
