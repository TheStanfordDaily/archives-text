## Stanford Leads Washington Series; Card Shutouts Feature Past Games 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
A rather battered but still husky
Washington Husky plays host to
the invading Stanford Indian this
Saturday in his home lair, Seattle.
The Washington powerhouse has
lost but one conference game, and
that to Southern California, so far
this year, while Stanford is as yet
undefeated. This is the crucial for
both teams.
Last year, the Big Red "Ilose
mobile" came to a staggering halt
before Messrs. Don Ileinrich,
Hugh McElhenny and Co. Wash
ington practically Hew over the
Indians to the tune of 21-7, as
quarterback Ileinrich completed
1!) out of 24 passes for 24.'! yards
and three Washington records.
This has not been the fashion,
however, in years past. Out of a
total of 27 games played, Stanford
has won 15, lost nine, and tied
three. Eight of Stanford's 15 vic
ries have been • shutouts, with two
games ending in scoreless ties.
The series started in 1893, with
the Card eleven coming out on top,
40-0. Their second meeting, in 1920,
saw Dink Templeton kick a 25-yard
field goal to give Stanford a 3-0
win. Since the war, the Huskies
have built up a 3-2 lead in the win
column, downing us in 1946, '47,
and '50. Stanford's two victories,
in 1948 and 1949, were 20-0 and 40-0
shutouts over weak Washington
teams.
The big crucial in the series
was in 1940. when the two teams,
both undeefated. met to derklu
the Rose Bowl representative.
Frankie Albert, Cluick Taylor,
and crew trailed 10-0 at half
lirne, but came back with a roar

to take the game. 20-10.
This year's Washington team is
practically the same as last year's,
with the loss of only three top
players, All-Coast halfback Roland
Kirkby, halfback Jack Seth, and
All-Coast end Joe Cloidt. Heinrich,
injured in practice in the beginning
of the year, has yet to play in a
game this year. Sam Mitchell and
Dean Rockey, second- and third
string quarterbacks behind Hein
rich, have so far done a yeoman's
job in placing Washington first in
the PCC in pass offense (Stanford is
first in pass defense).
Hugh McElhenny at fullback
leads the conference in scoring
with 07 points so far this year.
Hurryir' Hugh made first-string
All - Coast and third - team All-
American with his performances
last year, and set a new confer
ence record for rushing, 1.107
yards and a single-game record of
290 yards against Washington
State.

ence record for rushing, 1.107
yards and a single-game record of
290 yards against Washington
State.
A rather battered but still husky
Washington Husky plays host to
the invading Stanford Indian this
Saturday in his home lair, Seattle.
The Washington powerhouse has
lost but one conference game, and
that to Southern California, so far
this year, while Stanford is as yet
undefeated. This is the crucial for
both teams.
Last year, the Big Red "Ilose
mobile" came to a staggering halt
before Messrs. Don Ileinrich,
Hugh McElhenny and Co. Wash
ington practically Hew over the
Indians to the tune of 21-7, as
quarterback Ileinrich completed
1!) out of 24 passes for 24.'! yards
and three Washington records.
This has not been the fashion,
however, in years past. Out of a
total of 27 games played, Stanford
has won 15, lost nine, and tied
three. Eight of Stanford's 15 vic
ries have been • shutouts, with two
games ending in scoreless ties.
The series started in 1893, with
the Card eleven coming out on top,
40-0. Their second meeting, in 1920,
saw Dink Templeton kick a 25-yard
field goal to give Stanford a 3-0
win. Since the war, the Huskies
have built up a 3-2 lead in the win
column, downing us in 1946, '47,
and '50. Stanford's two victories,
in 1948 and 1949, were 20-0 and 40-0
shutouts over weak Washington
teams.
The big crucial in the series
was in 1940. when the two teams,
both undeefated. met to derklu
the Rose Bowl representative.
Frankie Albert, Cluick Taylor,
and crew trailed 10-0 at half
lirne, but came back with a roar

to take the game. 20-10.
This year's Washington team is
practically the same as last year's,
with the loss of only three top
players, All-Coast halfback Roland
Kirkby, halfback Jack Seth, and
All-Coast end Joe Cloidt. Heinrich,
injured in practice in the beginning
of the year, has yet to play in a
game this year. Sam Mitchell and
Dean Rockey, second- and third
string quarterbacks behind Hein
rich, have so far done a yeoman's
job in placing Washington first in
the PCC in pass offense (Stanford is
first in pass defense).
Hugh McElhenny at fullback
leads the conference in scoring
with 07 points so far this year.
Hurryir' Hugh made first-string
All - Coast and third - team All-
American with his performances
last year, and set a new confer
ence record for rushing, 1.107
yards and a single-game record of
290 yards against Washington
State.
