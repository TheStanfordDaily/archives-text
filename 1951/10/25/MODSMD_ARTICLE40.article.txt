# Rain Hits Grid Drill
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor's gridders were
given an extensive workout in tht
wet and the cold yesterday, thereby
getting a preview of the climatic
condition:; up at Seattle. The weath
er report says it's raining in Wash
ington.
The offense worked on the timing
of plays. Taylor has thrown several
new ones in, built especially to
work again t the Washington de
fense. Scout Mai Elward reports
that Stanford must have a healthy
respect for the Husky offense, but
that the defense can be "move:
against."
Washington, in her two losses to
USC and Illinois, was outscored by
means of passing. This means that
the Kerkorian-to-McColl combina
tion may be much in evidence this
Saturday. However, rain would
hamper the Indian air game, and
Seattle is noted for it:; rain.
Washington also has a strong air
attack, especially if Don Heinrich
is at the helm. Heinrich will prob
ably be used sparingly, however.
Sam Mitchell, the regular quarter
back, is second in passing statistics
to Kerkorian. George Lynn sent his
pass defenders through a long, hard
workout yesterday, and blocking for
defenders who intercept passes was
stressed, if that signifies anything.
Bob Bryan came down with the
flu, and was shelved in the Men's
Rest Home. On the other hand,
fullback Bob Meyers was running
at full steam and guard Jess Cone's
knee seemed much improved. The
coaching staff are still trying to de
cide who their two linebackers are
to be. The loss of Gordy Rice left a
sizable gap. Ted Tanner will be
one, and probably either Skip Crist
or Chuck Essegian will be the other.
