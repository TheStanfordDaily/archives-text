# Excom Sets Aside Young Republicans
## 
### 
Excom last night tabled a rec- j
ommendation to approve the i
constitution of the now unoffi
cial Stanford Young Republi
cans after much discussion and
debate pro and con.
A short constitution with blanket
bylaws and unspecific provisions
was proposed by John Beggs, for
mer president of the Young Repub
licans of Los Angeles County, and
by Merrill Mensor, who took sug
gestions for more specific provisions
for their constitution away from the
| meeting.
Arguments for approval centered
| around value of the organization in
I stimulating student interest in poli
j tics. ,
Partisanship
There was much discussion on the
j point of partisanship. It. was ar
j gued that there was a need for more
student interest in politics, but that I
jit should be on a non-partisan level.
j Maizie May, head of the YWCA's
j public affairs committee, offered to
| work with the Young Republicans
I along these lines; and Tom Peter
! son, speaking as an interested stu
j dent, suggested that the Young Re-
I publicans and the Young Demo
| crat.s, another unofficial group, join
I forces in bringing a non-partisan
j program of speakers to the campus.
The question of precedent, of '
' where Excom should draw the line
as to what political groups could j
officially organize on campus, came I
up for controversial discussion.
Bill Fundcnberg, sophomore class J
i representative, argued a precedent
j was established with the Student j
j World Federalists, which, he said,
| while not an official political party
jin this country, represent a defi
nite political philosophy.
Faculty Speakers
The club would sponsor speakers j
on politics and members of the
j Stanford faculty, according to Beggs
j and Mensor, and would include :
| speakers representing both major j
! parties.
It was suggested by Senior Class !
Representative Steve Blumbergj
j that provision be made in the con- j
| stitution's by-laws to refuse speak- â– 
ers campaigning for office and those :
actively supporting political candi
j dates.
The Republican group is expected
jto revise its constitution and re
' submit it for approval at next
i week's meeting, keeping in mind
Excom's specific suggestions. These
included defining qualification or
lack of qualification of speakers;
more rigid definition of the club's
purpose, membership requirements,
| and program.
Trustee Approval
The constitution must also be ap- j
proved by the Board of Trustees, j
j which meets the third Thursday of
. next month.
Excom last night also:
1. Gave a vote of confidence to
I the Foreign Scholarship Committee, j
j after bearing a budget report by j
co-chairman Phil Saeta, and a prog- j
, rcss Ireport by Dick Weismann, the j
i other co-chairman. Excom indi
| cated it would consider making the
I committee permanent. It was es
tablished on a temporary basis in
i 1048.
2. Heard a report from Pete Holle ;
j of the Student. Health Committer,
j who reported good progress in the
campus blood drive, despite late
I notification by the Red Cross.
3. Approved two revisions in the
A Phi O constitution, which provide
for two vice - presidents and cut
down to 50 per cent the members
! necessary for a quorum.
