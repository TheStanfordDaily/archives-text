In response to the fieri Cross's ur
gent appeal for blood donors when
their mobile unit visits the campus

men and women of 's?> to respond to
the call. The Juniors hope to giv~ the
majority of the 350 pint quota.

blood donations, and an indicator will
be plaeod at the Cellar, to tell which
class is supplying the most contribu
