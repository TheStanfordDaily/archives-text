# 'House of Bernarda Alba' Gives Pleasant Surprise
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
To audiences who suffered with the Stanford Players through
last year's undistinguished season, "The House of Bernarda Alba,"
which opened last night on the stage of Memorial Hall's Little
Theatre, will come as a pleasant surprise and, it is to be hoped, a
prophecy for the months ahead.
Their production of F. Garcia Lorca's drama about women in the

villages of Spain is splendidly staged |
and, for the most part, exceedingly j
well performed. It tells the story of ;
five daughters held captive, after the I
death of their father, in their own I
home by a domineering mother who
represents the Spanish caste system '
and code of honor carried to a tragic
extreme.
Bernarda, wielding her cane of
perverted power, shuts her girls j
away from life to mourn the death ]
of their father and wither to dust in
an atmosphere of .suffocating air- J
lessness. La Poncia, a servant, per
haps summarizes the situation as !
well as possible when she says of !
the daughters, "They're women |
without men, that's all."
But that is enough. Tragedy is j
the inevitable result of this abnor- \
trial state of affairs.
Evelyn McCurdy, as Bernarda, is j
excellent, giving an authoritative
performance which is even more ;
remarkable in the light of her elev
enth-hour substitution for Marian ;
Stcbbins, who, until her recent col- I
lapse, was to have played the part. I
And Mi. s McCurdy is matched
. cene for sccne by Doris Church,
superb in the role of La Poncia.
The rest of the cast, hews to an
equally high standard of acting with
the unhappy exceptions of Jean >
Leonard, whose overplayed Adela
suffers from stagy and repetitious \
manneri ms; and Nancy Langston,
who, as a servant, plays as if she
had boon ca.'t in a dramatization of
a swashbuckling historical novel.
Wendell Cole has designed a j
turdy, authentic-looking sot of a ;
Spani -h patio which adds enor- ;
mously to the production's over-all I
impression of solidity, and Hugo :
Melehionc's costumes are more than J
suitable.
In conclusion, "The House of
Bernarda Alba" can he recommend- ;
ed as a very worthwhile evening to
everyone who enjoys good theater.
