## Churchill Holds Lead In British Elections 
### 
LONDON, Friday, Oct. 26 (UP) —Wartime Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill and his Conservatives seemed assured today of
unseating the Laborites in the British general election, with Con
servative party headquarters claiming victory if the overnight
trend continued.
The city vote showed a sharp swing to Churchill, and there was

no sign that the trend would not
continue this afternoon. Thus the
British people seemed to have
granted the 76-year-old statesman
his last wish—a chance to try to
win the peace as he won the war.
All the big names of the old Par
liament were back as of early
morning— Attlee; his Foreign Sec
retary, Herbert Morrison; Richard
Stokes, the man who failed in Iran;
and even Aneurin Bevan, the left
wing Laborite rebel and his cohorts
who resigned from the Labor gov
ernment earlier in the year over the
rearmament program.
The standings of the parties at 4
a.m. (11 p.m. EST):
Labor—l 76
Conservative —145
Liberal—2
The final result, when one party
gels an absolute majority of the 625
seats in Commons, will not be
known until afternoon.
Winston Churchill gathered his
family and friends around a news
ticker tonight while crowds of well
wishers, who had almost mobbed
him when lie went to vote, shouted
outside his house for a glimpse of
"the next Prime Minister."
