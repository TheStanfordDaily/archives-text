# Stanford Invades Husky Lair
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
With everything to gain and just as much to lose, General Chuck
Taylor troops his contingent of Stanford football players into
Washington Stadium tomorrow to do battle with a menacing
University of Washington outfit.
This game will be a crucial in the fullest meaning of the word.

The same thing can be said about the
next four contests. A Stanford loss
would probably drop the Indians out
of the Rose Bowl race. A win might
give them the spark that would propel
them all the way.
Stanford's chances will rely mainly
upon the sling-shot right arm of
quarterback Gaiy Kcrkorian, who at
this writing has the top pass com
pletion record in the nation. At the
receiving end of Kerkorian's offer
ings will be Bill McColl, whom many
are calling Stanford's best all-time
linemen. Kcrkorian also doesn't
mind throwing things at Sam Morley,
Bill Storum, Harry Hugasian, and
Ron Cook.
Bob Meyers, the 18"> pound blond
fullback from Van Nuys. is hale
and hearty again and will open at
fullback. The 17 hand members

who arc trcking to Seattle can ex
pect to see a lot of Bob Mathias
also. iMathias has scored four
touchdowns in the last two games.
The two-v<reek loss of Eric South
wood hurts, but Ron Cook, the hard
running soph, will be a capable re
placement. Harry Hugasian, the half
back who doesn't run but gallops,
opens at left half. Look for heavy
duty work from half Wes Laubscher,
who came into his own last week.
The injury that, hurts is the loss
of lincbackcr Gordy Ricc. Rice broke
his ankle last week and is out for the
season. Ted Tanner will be at one
linebacker slot, while cither Chuck
Essegian or Skip Crist will be at the
other. Crist was just shifted from
offensive fullback to linebacker this

week.
Captain Jess Cone, the boiler
man of the defensive team, still
isn't in top shape, and that might
make a lot of difference. Cone Is
Stanford's top defensive man.
Washington also may bo plagued
by injuries. Bill Earley, the power
ful halfback, hurt a knee against
Illinois and may or may not play.
Even the great Hugh MeElhenny
may not be at peak efficiency. He,
too, has been nursing bruises in
curred in the Illinois contest.
Fullback MeElhenny is the king
pin of the Husky attack. He has
moved the ball .379 yards this season
at six yards a crack. With the sea
son just half completed, MeElhenny
has 67 points, only 18 shy of the all
time Washington record.
The Huskies, who have lost two
close games to USC and Illinois (the
best in the Big Ten), will also de
pend upon the air arms of Sam Mit
chell and Dean Rockey. Mitchell is
second only to Kcrkorian in PCC
passing statistics. Contrary to early
week reports, quarterback Don Hein

rich won't play for the hosts. Ibis
is good news for the Indians who
poignantly recall Hcinrich's 19 out
of 24 passing record in last year's
game.
Oach Howie Odell's outfit ad
heres strictly to the platoon system,
with one exception. That would he
Dick Sprague, an Ail-American
defensive halfback last year. He
goes both ways.
Stanford's offensive team averages
200 pounds as compared to the Wash
ington defense's 190. The Husky of
fensive averages 199 as compared to
the Indians' defense's 197.
A newcomer, guard Matt Armitage,
will probably poke his nose into the
fray tomorrow. The 205 pound frosh
guard has been impressive as of lato
and has made the 37 man traveling
squad.
The Card undefeated record vi'on't.
be the only thing that goes on the
block when Stanford invades the
Great Northwest. Chuck Taylor
hopes to come home with a rccord of
no defeats in 22 games as a head
coach.
