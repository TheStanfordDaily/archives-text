# Truce Line Sought
## 
### 
TOKYO â€” Allied negotiators met
with the Communists at Panmun
jom today to hear the Rod reply to
a "new and concrete" United Na
tion-; proposal for a truce line where
the Korean shooting would stop.
UN members of the joint truce
subcommittee gave the Reds a
"horse-trading" proposal at yester
day's first meeting in the renewed
talks. The UN offered to trade to
the Communists' 200 square miles
of territory it holds south of the
38th parallel in exchange for a like
amount of blood-soaked North Ko
rean ground held by the Allies.
The Reds also have been present
ed with a UN proposal to set up a
buffer zone 2'/2 miles wide across
Korea based roughly on the present
battlefront.
