# Language Program Debate Needed
## 
### 
The long-smoldering problem of lower di
vision language reguirements broke into the
open this week with a three-day series of ar
ticles by Daily Bull Sessioner Dick McLean. We
think McLean did an excellent job of construc
tive criticism.
Many students here have definite opinions
about the language requirements. Some don't
v. mt any foreign language at all. Others like
the program as now presented. We would
guess that the majority think the requirement
is valid, but feel the method of teaching lan
guages is not what is could be.
Dr. Douglas Whitaker, dean of the school of
humanities and sciences, said yesterday that
the entire lower division program, not just the
language requirement, is under review by the
lower division committee. Changes of some
sort may be forthcoming, but Dr. Whitaker told

The Daily that nothing definite can be predicted
now.
The process of academic change is slow, per
haps necessarily sc. But even though the proc
ess of changing an outdated language require
ment may be slow, there is no reason why this
process can't be influenced by representative
student opinion.
If students want a change, they can make
their wishes known through contact with Ex
com representatives and members of one of
the key campus groups, the student-faculty ed
ucation committee. Letters to The Daily on the
subject are welcomed. We have a hunch that
the faculty members who will make the final
decision will be receptive to student opinion
if a full discussion of the problem is carried
on in the same constructive manner in which
it was started.
