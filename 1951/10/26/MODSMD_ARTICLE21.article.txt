# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
Throw ten logs on the fire while ol' Uncle Remu.':
tolls you about the maddest scramble since the mix
master was invented.
The cast of characters are two girls and two boys,
who for the sake of argument we'll call Martha, Jane,
John and Bill. Follow them closely, because they're
going to interweave in the lines that follow.

Martha and Jane, roomates at
Union residence, had dates with
John and Bill, respectively. But
the girls ingeniously decided a
\\ y to switch dates, because they
both had stories due in a creative
writing class, and they thought
switching dates would make good
subject material for a short story.
They wanted to be Richard Halli
burton-ish about it and experience
their stories.

At 8:30 on the designated evening, Martha was
buzzed by John. This was the cue for Jane to rub
some crushed raw onion in her eyes to induce tears.
Jane met John in the lobby, and in her best Sara
Bernhardt, wept that Martha had an afternoon date
with a Cal .student, that the Cal student was overly
possessive and wouldn't let Martha come back for
her evening date with John.
When John asked why she was so upset by it all,
Jane wailed that on top of being worried about Martha,
Bill had broken his date with her. She had been
stranded because her car ran out of gas and when she
got back late, Bill had become tired of waiting and had
broken the date. John played into the trap, and told
Jane that since both of them had lost their dates that
he, John, would take her, Jane, to the house party.
Still with me? Okay, I'll proceed.

No sooner had John and Jane disappeared when
Bill arrived at Union, He buzzed the now-vanished
Jane, and this was the cue for Martha to scoop up the
remains of the crushed raw onions and rub them in
her eyes. Martha faked a story similar to Jane's,
and Bill, feeling sorry for Martha and having lost
his own date, took Martha to the drive-in to calm
her down.
According to plan, the girls asked their respective
dates to take them back to their residence at 10:30
p.m., because there might be a chance that their
original dates had returned.
If you're confused by now, do what Dean Borba
used to suggest . . . "Pick out a character and talk
to him."
Jane led John to the front lobby while Martha
deposited Kill in the small back lobby so the two
wouldn't see each other. The two girls met in their
room, shook hands, and then went down to the boys
they were originally supposed to date. The only thing
Martha and Jane had to do now was to wait until
John and Bill got together at some later date and
compared notes. This they did. and they discovered
to their mutual astonishment that they were the un
suspecting victims of the most precision-perfect plot
since the Immortal twenty-one stole the Big (iame
Axe.
Oh yes, there's one more performer in our little
drama. That's broad jumper Tom Schabarum. He
was invited to go to the party at John's fraternity
and also the party at Bill's house. He saw John and
Jane together at 9:30 p.m., and saw Bill and Jane at
the other party at 11:00 p.m.
To say that Schabarum was surprised would be the
understatement of the year.
