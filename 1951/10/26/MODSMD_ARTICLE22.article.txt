## Students State Egyptian Case 
### 
To the Editor:
The Egyptian-British treaty of 1936, as well as that
of 1899 concerning the joint Egyptian-British control
oI the Sudan were forced on the Egyptians with guns
in their backs.
The 193G treaty was signed with the outbreak of
the second world war in sight.
By abrogating the treaty the Egyptians did no more
than try.to breathe the clean air of freedom after
seventy years wf blind imperialistic rule. In doing
this they at least expect the sentimental backing of
the American people who have done the same not more
than two hundred years ago although they seem to
forget it.
The canal zone can be very efficiently defended by

Egyptian troops armed with American equipment. An
example not far from sight is the Turkish defense of
the Bosphorous, at least the canal is farther away
from communist aggression.
All the British want from Egpyt is economical ex
ploitation alter loosing out in India.
The American people who have been preaching free
dom for the past decades should not allow things like
that to happen in the twentieth century.
