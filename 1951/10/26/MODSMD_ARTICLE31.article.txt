Probably the primary reason—strange as it may sound—that the Indians
have yet to taste defeat this year is that Chuck Taylor has come up with the
horses. Not many; they'll never look like a thundering herd. But enough to
i win ball games.
The point is that injuries have not crippled the Cards as they did in past
years. Last year, especially. Stanford started out like a great team only to
get bogged down in tape, many many rolls of it. When Bruce VanAlstyne
wasn't able to play the opposition ganged up on McColl. They never stopped
him. You couldn't stop Bill. But they could concentrate on him and that
cut down the efficiency of the whole team.
The '51 edition of (he Big Red Machine has the spare parts needed for
quick repairs to keep it rolling. If Bill Storum were knocked out Saturday
Sam Morley could more than adequately (ill his shoes. Behind Morley are
I other good ends, John Steinberg, Bill Scheidecker. and Doug Pinto. All
Chuck Taylor would need to do is to reach down into his spare parts kit,
| around Stanford known as the Braves.
j Taylor did just that when he came up with Win Wedge and Matt Armitage
1 this week. How they'll do in varsity competition is still a question mark,
but in practice they've looked great. So has Skip Crist, who was switched
J from fullback to linebacker to replace Gordy Rice. But Crist couldn't have
been spared if there hadn't been enough horses to do the line bucking, if
' both Bob Meyers and Bob Mathias hadn't suddenly developed into two of
| the finest backs on the Coast.
Beginning of spring practice this year there was a gaping hole at center
! left by the graduation of Dick Abraham. It was considered one of the Cards'
| most crucial spots. It's been turned into one of the strongest by Rod Garner,
| who, after having a case of the jitters against Oregon and San Jose, has since
looked like a pro.
At quarterback behind Gary Kerkorian, who probably is the most
underrated player in the nation, is one of the most imposing reserves ever
gathered togetlu-r on one team. Either Bob Garrett, Jack Bickel, Dick
Horn, or Doug Collins, if they were at Berkeley might well be piloting the
Bears. But in the shadow of Kerkorian, Bickel is quarterbacking the
j Braves, and Horn and Collins have been switched to defensive specialists.
It isn't just a gold mine Chuck Taylor has fallen into though. Marchie
I Schwartz had the same material. What Chuck has done is to organize it,
! and the capital he's invested is beginning to bear interest.
