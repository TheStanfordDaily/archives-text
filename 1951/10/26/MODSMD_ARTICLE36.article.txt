# Romanic Profs Meet Biology
## 
### 
Biology Department students
tackle representatives of the Ro
manic Languages teaching stall' in
an attempt to whittle away at the
faculty's lead, as the Peerless Pig- i
skin Pickers' Poll heads into its j
fourth weekend.
At present the profs hold a cumu-]
lative lead of 76 per cent correct i
choices to 72 per cent for the vari- j
ous student pickers, and from the j
consistency of this week's selec- ;
tions it appears that not much
change will occur.
The main differences seem to lie j
in the Big Ten tossup between Wis- j
consin and Northwestern.
Picking for the biology majors j
this week are Doug Golkin, Mike j
Criley, and Roy Deffebach, while '
upholding the honor of the Romanic J
languages are Franxis X. Maggi
pinto, William Reynolds, and D. K. I
Roberts.
