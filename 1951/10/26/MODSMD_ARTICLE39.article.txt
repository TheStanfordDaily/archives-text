# Indians Beat Huskies Win by 20-10 in 1940
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
A gray day was even grayer
for Stanford's rooters on Satur
day, Nov. 9, 1940, at about 4
p.m. For in the twilight a buncli
of Washington Huskies were
slowly turning the fabulous
Wow Boys into just another ball
club.
The Huskies had powered to a
10 to 0 lead, and there before 70,000
screaming onlookers, they were
driving for another score.
Down the field uiey came. A be
hemoth fullback, Walt Harrison,
was gaining in three- and four-yard
chunks while quarterback Dean
McAdams' pin-point passing kept
the defense from drawing in to .stop
the running. McAdams hit a nine
yarder deep in Card territory and
it was second down one on the Stan
ford 29.
The next three piays were prob
ably the high point in Stanford grid
history, for with the Stanford root
ing section giving their famed Axe
Yell, Harrison was held for no gain
in three attempts as Ail-Americans
Mucha and Frankowski were un
able to move out a stubborn red
headed sophomore Stanford guard.
Stanford took over and drove for
a score with an Albert-Kmetovic
pass covering the last 39 yards and
quickly scored again on an inter
ception and Hugh Gallarneau's run
ning to score a miraculous 20 to 10
win.
As you probably know, or have
guessed, the red-headed guard who
couldn't be moved out is Chuck
Taylor.
Now eleven years later Washing
ton is again a big stumbling-block
in Stanford's path to the Rose Bowl.
Washington again has a big full
back spearheading a bruising at
tack. but Stanford cohorts are pray
ing that the Red Machine can again
come through against the Huskies.
