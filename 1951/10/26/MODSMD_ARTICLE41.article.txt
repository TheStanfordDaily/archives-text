the issue of co-operation with Com
munism. For years he has been a
leader in the National Congress
party and holds one of the party's
scats in the Indian Parliament.
Conflict with Nehru
His views bring him into frequent
conflict with Prime Minister Jawa
harlal Nehru and his neutral poli
cies abroad. Observers of the In
dian political scene say that his op
position to Nehru's policies make it
doubtful that he will be allowed to
campaign for his Congress party
