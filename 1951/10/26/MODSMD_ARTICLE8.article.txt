# BENEFITS RETURN
## Charity Drive to Aid Chest, Cancer Fight 
### 
Last, year the Palo Alto Commu
nity Chest gave the Stanford YVVCA
a $4,758 budget.
Yet the same year, the Stanford
fall charity drive donation to the
Palo Alto organization—which in
cludes seven other agencies besides
the Farm "Y"—only totaled a lit lie
over $700.
These figures point up the fact
that campus charity drive goals
come close to home, that the dona
tions often come back to benefit the
givers, Eleanor Yancey, chairman
of this quarter's drive, declared this
week. The only charity collection of
the quarter will last from Monday
through Friday of each week.
Departing from the past charity
campaign practice of holding sev
eral small events, this year's drive
will consist of two money-collect
ing techniques: scoliciting by living
group representatives from Mon
day through Friday, and a horror
movie Friday night in Cubberlcy
Auditorium.
Horror movie tickets will be sold
for 50 cents from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
starling Monday in front of the Cel
lar. The film will be shown Friday
at 7, 9, and 11 p.m.
Sixty per cent of the money col
lected will go to the Palo Alto Com
munity Chest; the remaining 40
per cent to the American Cancer
Society. The two charities were ap
proved by the ASSU Drives Cojn
mittee, formed hv Excom Fast
spring. The drives group investi
gated the two organizations on such
counts as balance between admin
istrative efficiency and good actu

ally accomplished, college programs, j
and interest, to college-age people. J

Alto Community Chest includes: |
