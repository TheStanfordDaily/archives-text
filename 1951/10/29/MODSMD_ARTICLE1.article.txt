# INDIAN HOPES SOAR WITH HUSKY WIN!
## Cards Repulse Husky Drives 
### BILL SWIGART 
WASHINGTON STADIUM. SEATTLE, Oct. 27—A surprisingly
strong Stanford grid team became a major Rose Bowl possibility
here this alternoon by defeating the dangerous Washington Hus
kies, 14 to 7, with a spine-tingling exhibition of keep-away football.
It was a big win for the white-shirted Indians who had failed to

impress their critics in spite of an
unblemished slate of five previous
victories; and the loss, a bitter dis
appointment to a lot of the old grad.s :
in the large homecoming crowd of
48,500 who had turned out to watch •
the favored Huskies climb back onto
the Rose Bowl trail.
The till-now lightly regarded Cards,
displaying the poise of champions,
ground out first downs when they
needed them the most, and held fast
on defense when it was either hold or
lose the game. The Stanfords won
hands-down in a game of controlling
the football, and it was this poi.se that
enabled them to do it.
By the fame token, it has been
this same self assurance that has
enabled these same Indians to conic
from behind to win three previous
games this year, and to triumph
after being tied in two more.
The Cards came back strong again
today after a 69-yard dash around
left end by Washingtons great full
back Hugh McElhenny had knotted
the score at seven-all, and a Stanford
drive had been stopped by a fumble
inside the Washington 25-yard line
The way they came back today
I would make any Son of the Stanford
j Red swell with pride.
The Indian defenders held fast as
I they did in the clutch all day, and
I safty man Don Sanders returned
j Washington's punt 12 yards to the
Stanford 34. Wes Laubscher swung
around left end for 5 gained, and it
was second and five on the 39.
It was at this point that fullback
Bob Mathias, a clutch performer
from away back, took off on one of
the most crucial runs of the after
noon. Picking his way through a
hole over right tackle. Mathias,
short of experience but long on
! determination, bounced, dodged,
and slashed his way through a host
of tacklers for 34 yards and a first
down on the Husky 27.
But Ron Cook's subsequent 5-yard
gain was nullified by a holding pen
| alty, and after a screen pass. Ker
korian to McColl, netted 10, two more
j pass attempts went awry and it was
i fourth and 15 to go on Washington's
32.
Kerkorian faded to pass, was
; rushed and saw no one open, so he
I tucked the football under his arm
and headed straight up the middle,
i At the line of scrimmage ho stumbled
over a surprised teammate, eluded
the clutch of a would-be tackier, and
threaded his way for 19 yards and a
first down before being pulled to the
grass at the Washington 13.
The attack threatened to bog again
I two downs later, but a pass to Ron
: Cook gained eight, and Mathias de
! livered as usual for a first and goal
! to-go on the two.
Ron Cook lunged over for the TD;
Kerkorian converted; and the In
dians led again. 14 to 7, with 11
minutes and 7 seconds remaining

on the scoreboard.
Following a Husky punt Stanford
threatened once more. With Harry
Hugasian, Cook, and Mathias picking
nice holes the attack carried to the
Washington 34 before it was stopped.
Only seven minutes, 20 seconds to
play, but as Washington began to
gain it seemed like an hour.
Husky half Dick Sprag\ie swept
right end for a first down on the 47;
a pass in the flat to end Phil Gil lis
gained 13 more.
Co-captain Jess Cone who had
been held out with a bad leg came
in to bolster the tiring Indian line,
but McElhenny broke around left
end for seven gained, lost one into
the line, hut scrambled through
right tackle for 10 more.
Three minutes to go, first and ten
on the Stanford 25, and Sprague made
five more around end—but then the
Cards got tough.
Sprague made two more in the line
and Bill Earley gained one, but on
fourth down McElhenny was inches
short and Stanford took over on its
own 16.
Three running plays gained two
yards, killed a minute and 42 seconds,
and the game was history.
The Indians, advertised as an
"all-hit. no-field" team, can today
thank their toughening defensive
platoon for their biggest win to date
in an unbeaten skein of six. It
would be difficult to single out all
the names that deserve praise, but
we did see a lot of A 1 Kirkland.
Ted Tanner, Chuck Essegian. Jack
Rye, Boh Latham, Bob Thompson,
and Don Sanders.
Quarterback Gary Kerkorian, di
recting the Card attack with the cool
efficiency of a veteran, had one of
his finest days. With 12 completions
in 24 attempts for 160 yards he had
all the host of the publicized aerial
duel with air-minded Washington in
spite of the fact that he was rushed
exceptionally hard on every play by
the Husky forwards after the first
Stanford touchdown.
In the end this undue rush proved
the Huskies downfall as it opened the
way for long gainers on screen passes,
and for two fourth-down long runs
by Kerkorian himself. The screen
passes were good for important yard
age every time, and one to Bill
Storum in the second quarter went
for 58 yards.
The cards moved 72 yards on II
plays to their initial score the first
time they laid their hands on the
hall and it looked for a while as if
the game might turn into a rout,
hut Washington stiffened noticeably
after the touchdown — although
most of the game was played inside
Washington's forty with the In
dians in possession.


MATHIAS ON THE MOVE—Bob Mathias, who proved himself
quite a fullback Saturday, blasts through the Washington line
for 35 precious yards n£ar the close of the third quarter. Bob's
run set up the Indian's final score. Ron Cook, Card halfback, is

coming up at the right to lend assistance. Norm Manoogian,
45, has opened the hole. Identified Huskies are Jim Wiley, 49,
Clyde Seiler, 78, and Wayne Wardlow, 76.

WASHINGTON STADIUM. SEATTLE, Oct. 27—A surprisingly
strong Stanford grid team became a major Rose Bowl possibility
here this alternoon by defeating the dangerous Washington Hus
kies, 14 to 7, with a spine-tingling exhibition of keep-away football.
It was a big win for the white-shirted Indians who had failed to

impress their critics in spite of an
unblemished slate of five previous
victories; and the loss, a bitter dis
appointment to a lot of the old grad.s :
in the large homecoming crowd of
48,500 who had turned out to watch •
the favored Huskies climb back onto
the Rose Bowl trail.
The till-now lightly regarded Cards,
displaying the poise of champions,
ground out first downs when they
needed them the most, and held fast
on defense when it was either hold or
lose the game. The Stanfords won
hands-down in a game of controlling
the football, and it was this poi.se that
enabled them to do it.
By the fame token, it has been
this same self assurance that has
enabled these same Indians to conic
from behind to win three previous
games this year, and to triumph
after being tied in two more.
The Cards came back strong again
today after a 69-yard dash around
left end by Washingtons great full
back Hugh McElhenny had knotted
the score at seven-all, and a Stanford
drive had been stopped by a fumble
inside the Washington 25-yard line
The way they came back today
I would make any Son of the Stanford
j Red swell with pride.
The Indian defenders held fast as
I they did in the clutch all day, and
I safty man Don Sanders returned
j Washington's punt 12 yards to the
Stanford 34. Wes Laubscher swung
around left end for 5 gained, and it
was second and five on the 39.
It was at this point that fullback
Bob Mathias, a clutch performer
from away back, took off on one of
the most crucial runs of the after
noon. Picking his way through a
hole over right tackle. Mathias,
short of experience but long on
! determination, bounced, dodged,
and slashed his way through a host
of tacklers for 34 yards and a first
down on the Husky 27.
But Ron Cook's subsequent 5-yard
gain was nullified by a holding pen
| alty, and after a screen pass. Ker
korian to McColl, netted 10, two more
j pass attempts went awry and it was
i fourth and 15 to go on Washington's
32.
Kerkorian faded to pass, was
; rushed and saw no one open, so he
I tucked the football under his arm
and headed straight up the middle,
i At the line of scrimmage ho stumbled
over a surprised teammate, eluded
the clutch of a would-be tackier, and
threaded his way for 19 yards and a
first down before being pulled to the
grass at the Washington 13.
The attack threatened to bog again
I two downs later, but a pass to Ron
: Cook gained eight, and Mathias de
! livered as usual for a first and goal
! to-go on the two.
Ron Cook lunged over for the TD;
Kerkorian converted; and the In
dians led again. 14 to 7, with 11
minutes and 7 seconds remaining

on the scoreboard.
Following a Husky punt Stanford
threatened once more. With Harry
Hugasian, Cook, and Mathias picking
nice holes the attack carried to the
Washington 34 before it was stopped.
Only seven minutes, 20 seconds to
play, but as Washington began to
gain it seemed like an hour.
Husky half Dick Sprag\ie swept
right end for a first down on the 47;
a pass in the flat to end Phil Gil lis
gained 13 more.
Co-captain Jess Cone who had
been held out with a bad leg came
in to bolster the tiring Indian line,
but McElhenny broke around left
end for seven gained, lost one into
the line, hut scrambled through
right tackle for 10 more.
Three minutes to go, first and ten
on the Stanford 25, and Sprague made
five more around end—but then the
Cards got tough.
Sprague made two more in the line
and Bill Earley gained one, but on
fourth down McElhenny was inches
short and Stanford took over on its
own 16.
Three running plays gained two
yards, killed a minute and 42 seconds,
and the game was history.
The Indians, advertised as an
"all-hit. no-field" team, can today
thank their toughening defensive
platoon for their biggest win to date
in an unbeaten skein of six. It
would be difficult to single out all
the names that deserve praise, but
we did see a lot of A 1 Kirkland.
Ted Tanner, Chuck Essegian. Jack
Rye, Boh Latham, Bob Thompson,
and Don Sanders.
Quarterback Gary Kerkorian, di
recting the Card attack with the cool
efficiency of a veteran, had one of
his finest days. With 12 completions
in 24 attempts for 160 yards he had
all the host of the publicized aerial
duel with air-minded Washington in
spite of the fact that he was rushed
exceptionally hard on every play by
the Husky forwards after the first
Stanford touchdown.
In the end this undue rush proved
the Huskies downfall as it opened the
way for long gainers on screen passes,
and for two fourth-down long runs
by Kerkorian himself. The screen
passes were good for important yard

Quarterback Gary Kerkorian, di

in 24 attempts for 160 yards he had
all the host of the publicized aerial
duel with air-minded Washington in
spite of the fact that he was rushed
exceptionally hard on every play by
the Husky forwards after the first
Stanford touchdown.
In the end this undue rush proved
the Huskies downfall as it opened the
way for long gainers on screen passes,
and for two fourth-down long runs
by Kerkorian himself. The screen
passes were good for important yard
age every time, and one to Bill
Storum in the second quarter went
for 58 yards.
The cards moved 72 yards on II
plays to their initial score the first
time they laid their hands on the
hall and it looked for a while as if

after the touchdown — although
most of the game was played inside

WASHINGTON STADIUM. SEATTLE, Oct. 27—A surprisingly
strong Stanford grid team became a major Rose Bowl possibility
here this alternoon by defeating the dangerous Washington Hus
kies, 14 to 7, with a spine-tingling exhibition of keep-away football.
It was a big win for the white-shirted Indians who had failed to

impress their critics in spite of an
unblemished slate of five previous
victories; and the loss, a bitter dis
appointment to a lot of the old grad.s :
in the large homecoming crowd of
48,500 who had turned out to watch •
the favored Huskies climb back onto
the Rose Bowl trail.
The till-now lightly regarded Cards,
displaying the poise of champions,
ground out first downs when they
needed them the most, and held fast
on defense when it was either hold or
lose the game. The Stanfords won
hands-down in a game of controlling
the football, and it was this poi.se that
enabled them to do it.
By the fame token, it has been
this same self assurance that has
enabled these same Indians to conic
from behind to win three previous
games this year, and to triumph
after being tied in two more.
The Cards came back strong again
today after a 69-yard dash around
left end by Washingtons great full
back Hugh McElhenny had knotted
the score at seven-all, and a Stanford
drive had been stopped by a fumble
inside the Washington 25-yard line
The way they came back today
I would make any Son of the Stanford
j Red swell with pride.
The Indian defenders held fast as
I they did in the clutch all day, and
I safty man Don Sanders returned
j Washington's punt 12 yards to the
Stanford 34. Wes Laubscher swung
around left end for 5 gained, and it
was second and five on the 39.
It was at this point that fullback
Bob Mathias, a clutch performer
from away back, took off on one of
the most crucial runs of the after
noon. Picking his way through a
hole over right tackle. Mathias,
short of experience but long on
! determination, bounced, dodged,
and slashed his way through a host
of tacklers for 34 yards and a first
down on the Husky 27.
But Ron Cook's subsequent 5-yard
gain was nullified by a holding pen
| alty, and after a screen pass. Ker
korian to McColl, netted 10, two more
j pass attempts went awry and it was
i fourth and 15 to go on Washington's
32.
Kerkorian faded to pass, was
; rushed and saw no one open, so he
I tucked the football under his arm
and headed straight up the middle,
i At the line of scrimmage ho stumbled
over a surprised teammate, eluded
the clutch of a would-be tackier, and
threaded his way for 19 yards and a
first down before being pulled to the
grass at the Washington 13.
The attack threatened to bog again
I two downs later, but a pass to Ron
: Cook gained eight, and Mathias de
! livered as usual for a first and goal
! to-go on the two.
Ron Cook lunged over for the TD;
Kerkorian converted; and the In
dians led again. 14 to 7, with 11
minutes and 7 seconds remaining

on the scoreboard.
Following a Husky punt Stanford
threatened once more. With Harry
Hugasian, Cook, and Mathias picking
nice holes the attack carried to the
Washington 34 before it was stopped.
Only seven minutes, 20 seconds to
play, but as Washington began to
gain it seemed like an hour.
Husky half Dick Sprag\ie swept
right end for a first down on the 47;
a pass in the flat to end Phil Gil lis
gained 13 more.
Co-captain Jess Cone who had
been held out with a bad leg came
in to bolster the tiring Indian line,
but McElhenny broke around left
end for seven gained, lost one into
the line, hut scrambled through
right tackle for 10 more.
Three minutes to go, first and ten
on the Stanford 25, and Sprague made
five more around end—but then the
Cards got tough.
Sprague made two more in the line
and Bill Earley gained one, but on
fourth down McElhenny was inches
short and Stanford took over on its
own 16.
Three running plays gained two
yards, killed a minute and 42 seconds,

Hugasian, Cook, and Mathias picking
nice holes the attack carried to the
Washington 34 before it was stopped.
Only seven minutes, 20 seconds to
play, but as Washington began to
gain it seemed like an hour.
Husky half Dick Sprag\ie swept
right end for a first down on the 47;
a pass in the flat to end Phil Gil lis
gained 13 more.
Co-captain Jess Cone who had
been held out with a bad leg came
in to bolster the tiring Indian line,
but McElhenny broke around left
end for seven gained, lost one into
the line, hut scrambled through
right tackle for 10 more.
Three minutes to go, first and ten
on the Stanford 25, and Sprague made
five more around end—but then the
Cards got tough.
Sprague made two more in the line
and Bill Earley gained one, but on
fourth down McElhenny was inches
short and Stanford took over on its
own 16.
Three running plays gained two
yards, killed a minute and 42 seconds,
and the game was history.
The Indians, advertised as an
"all-hit. no-field" team, can today
thank their toughening defensive
platoon for their biggest win to date
in an unbeaten skein of six. It
would be difficult to single out all
the names that deserve praise, but
we did see a lot of A 1 Kirkland.
Ted Tanner, Chuck Essegian. Jack
Rye, Boh Latham, Bob Thompson,
and Don Sanders.
Quarterback Gary Kerkorian, di
recting the Card attack with the cool
efficiency of a veteran, had one of
his finest days. With 12 completions
in 24 attempts for 160 yards he had
all the host of the publicized aerial
duel with air-minded Washington in
spite of the fact that he was rushed
exceptionally hard on every play by
the Husky forwards after the first
Stanford touchdown.
In the end this undue rush proved
the Huskies downfall as it opened the
way for long gainers on screen passes,
and for two fourth-down long runs
by Kerkorian himself. The screen
passes were good for important yard
age every time, and one to Bill
Storum in the second quarter went
for 58 yards.
The cards moved 72 yards on II
plays to their initial score the first
time they laid their hands on the
hall and it looked for a while as if
the game might turn into a rout,
hut Washington stiffened noticeably
after the touchdown — although
most of the game was played inside
Washington's forty with the In
dians in possession.


MATHIAS ON THE MOVE—Bob Mathias, who proved himself
quite a fullback Saturday, blasts through the Washington line
for 35 precious yards n£ar the close of the third quarter. Bob's
run set up the Indian's final score. Ron Cook, Card halfback, is

coming up at the right to lend assistance. Norm Manoogian,
45, has opened the hole. Identified Huskies are Jim Wiley, 49,
Clyde Seiler, 78, and Wayne Wardlow, 76.
