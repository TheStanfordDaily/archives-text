### 
OAKLAND, Oct. 28 (UP) â€”A
huge Greyhound bus roaring up an
approach to the San Francisco Bny
Bridge bounced off a block of con
crcto in the roadway early today,
ripped through guard rails, and
plunged .">0 foot to earth, killing sev
en persons and injuring 23.
Police said the two accidents oc
curred within two minutes of each
other so there was not time to put
up a warning that the concrete was
in the roadway.
The bus tore through the railing
on the approach, splintering stan
chions as though they were tooth
picks, rolling over as it plunged off
the ramp and landed almost upside
down, flattening the top along its
left edge.
