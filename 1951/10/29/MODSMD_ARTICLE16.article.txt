### PETE GROTHE 
BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS
I'm going to turn philosopher today, and if Professor
Mothershead wants to stick the treatise that follows
in his course between Aristotle and Plato, I won t be
offended. He caji't put it next to Nietzsche, though.
Nietzsche is a gentleman of Donald E. Close leanings.

The profs in the sociology de
partment say that there is no such
thing as "the good old days." "The
good old days," they maintain, are
just a romantic picture of what we
wish things were like. I subscribe
to this theory to a good extent,
but there are certain aspects of
those good old days that I wish
were with us today.
In those days they used to sing
songs like "I Want a Girl Just Like

The Girl Tlutt Married Dear Old Dad." What do they
sing now? "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend."
Then, Emerson used to mean Ralph Waldo. Now
it means Fay. They used to sing songs that had
melody. Now it's harmony that's stressed.
Days used to be when the head of the family would
sit in front of the fire in a comfortable leather chair
and read the Bible. Keats, or Browning to the family.

Now everyone sits in a contour chair and has canned j
entertainment on the television screen in the form of j
Kukla, Fran, and Ollie.
Our grandfathers would solve problems by sitting
around (be table and talking them out with the
family. Nowadays we lie on a psychiatrist's couch
at 20 bucks a shot.
I want to niake it clear that I am not a status quo-er.
I, for one, would not depart from our modern con
veniences. But doggone it, in the good old days, you
could get poor grades and all that you'd receive would
he? a licking with the razor strap.
When you bring home poor grades today you get
drafted.

FOOTBALL QUICKIE. Braves Coach Bob Ghilotti
describes Gary Crosby as a good, hustling linebacker.
But the other day. Earl Odell reports, he was assigned i
to guard Bill McColl in a passing scrimmage, and j
Gary couldn't quite cope with the glue-pawed Ail-
American. Time alter time, the short, stocky line- j
backer churned downfield, taking four steps to every !
stride of McColl's and couldn't stop Bill from glom- ;
ming on to aerials. Finally, McColl cooly accepted a j
40 yard pass over Crosby's frustrated grasp, and Gary j
voiced, "Well. I'll be damned." Or words to that effect. !
