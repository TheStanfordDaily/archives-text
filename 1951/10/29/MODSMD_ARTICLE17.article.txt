## Language Requirement Change Urged 
### 
To the Editor:
Mr. McLean is right about this foreign language
requirement in Lower Division. Things must be
changed in the language departments, but not so dras
tically as to abolish languages as a requirement. The
change should be constructive rather than destructive.
The lack of motivation perhaps lies behind much of
this disinterest in languages. Most of the languages
have a poor choice of textbooks. If the quality of in
terest of textbooks were to be judged according to
the topics in the books, then many of the present texts
would belong in high school language courses.
Instead of making first-year courses a dull monotony
of memorizing vocabulary based on trivialities, I sug
gest that the language departments get together and
select new texts or make up syllabi which concern the
foreign language's culture, economy, literature, geog
raphy, etc. This first-year indoctrination to a foreign
language would appeal to a greater number of stu
dents.
For the history major, there might be short anec
dotes on the foreign country's past history that might
shine some light on its present-day world position. The
econ major will probably find out about some of the
important resources, the chief cities and the geography
of some foreign country; this extra knowledge would
be invaluable to a student in such a field.
This kind of revision and preparation, of course,
takes a lot of work. The advantages gained from the
probable revitalizing interest in the languages and the
long-run, liberal knowledge of the foreign countries,
however, may justify the extra efforts on the part of
the professors.
Finally, the grades in this type of language course
will not depend entirely upon a knowledge of the
vocabulary, which is so difficult to so many. Exams
in these new language courses might perhaps be based
upon knowledge of the general culture and physical
characteristics of the country in addition to the gram
mar and the vocabulary.
