To the Editor:
Cheers for McLean! At last someone has publicly
{pointed out the uselessness and futility of the language
requirement. One third of my fifteen unit curriculum'
is language. I am pitying $75 per quarter tuition as
well as sDending a good deal of time on something 1
;.m convinced will never do me any good.
I have not a particle of interest in the course. I do
my work half heartedly. I hate to think of all the
courses in which I have a genuine interest that I could
take instead of stumbling through an endless maze of
past subjunctives and preterits. The whole idea of
vetting a liberal education is fouled when student' f;>i|
to get anything out of a course designed io promote
liberal education.
1 say let those who want to be linguists and Mexican
peons take the language courscs and let the other
vast multitude of uninterested language sufTerets
broaden their education in fields where they have
some interest.
