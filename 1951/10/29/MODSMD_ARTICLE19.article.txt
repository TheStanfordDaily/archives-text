To the Editor:
I certainly agree with Dick McLean that the lan
guage requirement in foreign languages is antiquated
. rid outmoded. It is a drudgery that should hp re
moved.
1 finished #22 last year with little knowledge of
the language. I wish I had more hut the right courses
are lost in monotony. If there were ix'tter courses
offered I would certainly like to extend my foreign
language training.
Best of luck in your efforts.
