## 
### 
Sign-ups for blood donations
climbed to 341 last Friday.
Today is absolutely the last
day students may make appoint
ments to give their blood tomor
row. Two appointment booths at
the Cellar and one outside the
main library, manned by A Phi
O pledges, will be open all day !
today from 9 to 5.
Students under 21 must present;
parental permission slips in order to
make an appointment.
Tomorrow a mobile Red Cross
unit will set up headquarters on the
main floor of the Women's Club
house and will take donors from
8 to 12 and 1 to 5. Donors are sup
posed to oat nothing but liquids for
four hours before Hiving their
blood.
Of the 341 students who have !
signed the appointment lists, 76 per
cent are off-campus and Village
students. It has been pointed out
that these students probably include
a large number of veterans who
realize from personal experience
the importance of blood donations.
Women are needed to help out ;
the Red Cross staff by working as
receptionists tomorrow. They are
asked to work in one-hour shifts.
Anyone interested in helping should
contact Peppy Hunt at Lagunita
Court.
Although the number of sign-ups
is still below the quota, Pete Halle,
chairman of the Student Health
Committee, attributes this to the
slow return of permission slips and
expects the number of sign-ups to
double today.


LIFE'S BLOODâ€”After being given a blood transfusion, this
soldier will live. The blood, flown from the United States to the
Korean battlefronts in less than a week, is made available
through the efforts of the American Red Cross in securing blood
donations.
