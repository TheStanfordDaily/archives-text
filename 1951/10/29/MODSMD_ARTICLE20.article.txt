To the Editor:
I wholeheartedly agree with Dick McLean's articles
on the language requirements. I have- a poor language
aptitude and therefore have to spend way over the
normal ulloUnent of time studying language in order
not to go minus in it. I hate to see future students
placet! in this position.
