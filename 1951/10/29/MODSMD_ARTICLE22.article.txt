To the Editor:
We also heartily agree with Dick McLean that the
present language requirement be disposed of. People
who really need a foreign language will realize it and
take it in their own time.
At present the way the subject is taught even stu
dents who have completed the full requirements can
not hope to get beyond "Where is the hotel?" in a
foreign country and translating Cyrano de Bergerac
will do you little good in France.
It is also wasting the time of students and instructors
to cram these purposeless facts into our resisting
minds.
