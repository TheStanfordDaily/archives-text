To the Editor:
I am in full agreement with Mr. McLean's recent
articles that the foreign language requirements of
this institution should be revised.
I feel that the number of units should be reduced
and a greater emphasis placed on a speaking knowl
edge. It should be the individual's choice between
more language and another broadening subject.
