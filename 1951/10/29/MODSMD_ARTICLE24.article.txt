# Bull Session Crusading?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Although we are in sympathy with Mr. McLean,
and are inclined to agree with the measures he has
proposed in his last three columns, wo feel that the
editorial column is more suitable for such crusading.
It is our assumption that "Bull Session" is intended to
be a humor column; we hope that in the future it will
be devoted solely to that purpose.

Editor's Noteâ€”Hull Session will continue to lie a
personalized column dealing with humorous, serious
and iii-lietween topics. In short, a bull session.
