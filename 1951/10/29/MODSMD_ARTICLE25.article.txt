# On Egypt's Problems
## 
### 
To the Editor:
I have read with interest the letter by the Egyptian
brothers. I urge that the idealistic sentiments of the
people of the United States should not allow them to
acclaim anything in other countries which they would
not tolerate in their own land. National aspirations
; nd the desire to develop national status in every
country must be supported and I am sure the people
of this great country will not fail to probe into the
particular problems of Egypt.
The existence of a common enemy should not be
made a mask for the exercise of injustice by one coun
try over another. Oppression is bad in any form and
could not be chosen between, at least by the oppressed,
the immediate problem always being the mors im
portant.
The days of colonialism are indeed over; but Britain
now, by the sheer force, of necessity, of course, from
her standpoint — all sympathies to her — manages a
systematic process of manipulation in the affairs of
the countries of the East. But let us not forget that
the fact that these countries suffered could not stand
a> an argument for a continuing disadvantageous po
• iI ion. It only goes to show that the previous structure
was on unjustified grounds. In any case, the remedies
for the ills of Britain must be sought elsewhere.
