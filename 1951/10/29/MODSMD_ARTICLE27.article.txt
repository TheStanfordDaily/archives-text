### 
A Stanford graduate history student has received an eight
month research grant which will take him to 11 Latin-American
countries on a survey of Okinawan communities.
The student, James L. Tigner Ir. of Palo Alto, received the grant
of Army funds through the Pacific Science Board of the National

1 Research Council.

! will serve as his doctoral thesis in
history, will be used to assist in the
U.S. Civil Administration of Oki-
I nawa.
| More than 30,000 Okinawans,
: often mistakenly thought to be Jap-
I anese, live in Brazil alone. Most of
: them emigrated to Latin America
' after 1920, when Okinawa was un
j der Japanese control.
Tigner, who graduated from the
I University of Redlands in 1948 after
j serving five years as a pilot and
air combat intelligence oilicer with
| the U.S. Air Force, has been at
j Stanford since 1948.
As a prelude to the South Amori
i can phase of his work, Tigner made
I a two-month trip to the Far East,
j visiting Army headquarters in Ja
j pan and conferring with Brigadier
j General James M. Lewis, civil ad
l ministfator in Okinawa.
The countries he will visit in
Latin America are Brazil, Argen
tina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,
