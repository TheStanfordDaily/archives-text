# Kansas Fraternities Clear Flood Damage
## 
### 
The ATO's aren't the only ones.
The entire 24 fraternities at the University of Kansas decided this
year to forego any homecoming decorations and instead contrib
ute their time and work to cleaning up in North Lawrence, Kansas, i
where floods hit hardest this summer.
The University Daily Kansan reported recently that more than ,

! 700 fraternity men turned out to |
work on the flood clean-up project
which included everything "from
erecting a sunken house to painting
woodwork." Life magazine had a
j pictorial article' on the clean-up last ;
| month.
Each fraternity there took the )
I responsibility of working on six !
houses. In many cases they worked
|on homes which had been aban
doned following the July flood and
â–  had not been reoccupied.
The Daily Kansan pointed out,
"Estimating an average of 500 men
| working seven man - hours during
the day, approximately $4,735 worth
jof labor was donated. That is ac-
I cording to the $1.25 hourly wage
prevalent in the area."

Twenty-one ATO pledges end
ed a new kind of "hell week" last
Saturday with six days of con
structive labor renovating the
Palo Alio YMCA.
YMCA officials said that they
were very much pleased with the
work of the pledges and that they
had done more work than had
been assigned tliem.

Equipment, mostly shovels, for
the mass work day was provided by
the Union Pacific Railroad and the
University of Kansas. Trucks were
borrowed from Lawrence motor
dealers.
The community appreciation, ex
pressed by many people there, was
caught best by the Kansan reporter
when she quoted one man as say
ing, "I don't know what we would
have done without them. It is noth
ing short of a miracle. These boys
have done a great job."
In addition to the labor, the Inter-
Fraternity Council at KU voted to
donate money usually spent on dec
orations, around $1,200, to a central
fund to be used for flood relief.
Said the Kansan, "At the end of
the day the members of the IFC
were wet, tired, and muddy, but
they all thought the project worth
it."
