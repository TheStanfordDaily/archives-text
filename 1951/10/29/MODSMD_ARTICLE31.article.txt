# Frosh's Parking Ticket Canceled
## 
### 
Men's Council canceled a parking
ticket appealed by an Encina fresh
man Thursday. The appeal was al
lowed because of special circum
stances.
In canceling the ticket, however,
President Dick Bennett stressed the
fact that people driving cars on the
campus are responsible for observ
ing campus traffic regulations. Any
car owner who does not know these
regulations should pick up a copy
of them at the campus police sta
tion in the Corporation Yard, said
Bennett.
