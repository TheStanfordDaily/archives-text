# High Spirits Rule of Day
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
While the Indian team was far
north in Seattle trying to snare the
elusive Husky, loyal Farm rooters
gathered at Rossotti's and Shangri-
La to cheer their team to the all
important win. Bubbling over with
enthusiasm, happy Stanfordites
combined the fine weather, a play
by-play broadcast, and liquid re
freshments inlo the proverbial per
fect brew on Saturday.
After lunch, plans began to form
to hit either of the rally points.
Some radios had the exciting
Army - Columbia game on; others
put on Stanford songs.
Spirits Pick Up
Out at Rossotti's nearly 200 sat
mound the picnic tables and list
ened to the game being piped over
a public address system. Spirits
.seemed to pick up as the afternoon
progressed. At times it got hard to
hear the broadcast as anxious root
ers yelled for a "Score now, Big
Red" or a "Hold that line."
Things looked pretty glum after
hustling Hugh McElhenny made his
spectacular 09 - yard sprint. Faces
were long. And Card rooters tried
to drown their sorrows with a
couple "extras." But interest soared
again as the Big Red Machine
roared back to head for that win
ning teedee.
Only those close to the loud
speakers knew what was going on
when Gary Kerkorian made his
dash after coming close to being
trapped. Screams and cheers got
louder and louder as most thought
Gary had gone all the way. An
other loud roar went up when Bob
Mathias rumbled forward to the
crucial first down on the two-yard
line. Then the score and bedlam.
Huskies Apply Pressure
Tension mounted when Washing
ton came roaring back and threat
ened to tie up the ball game.
Screams came for the "Axe Yell" as
the Huskies got closer and closer.
With only a little over a minute left
and the Indians in possession, root
ers relaxed for a moment.
Unbelievingly close to the final
gun and a fantastic victory, the as
semblage held their collective
breath as the plays unfolded and
the clock ticked awya. Twice the
announcer blasted out about Card
fumbles and the victory - hungry
Red fans moaned.
Glorious Celebration
Suddenly the game was over and
the celebrating really began. Horns
blasted, everybody rushed for cars,
hugging and embracing friends and
strangers alike. There was a rous- ■
ing "Six" for the team in Washing- j
ton, and a tremendous "Coach Yell."
Then the mob broke up and a noisy i
caravan headed back to campus
with horns blasting and voices'
straining.

ened to the game being piped over
a public address system. Spirits
.seemed to pick up as the afternoon
progressed. At times it got hard to
hear the broadcast as anxious root
ers yelled for a "Score now, Big
Red" or a "Hold that line."
Things looked pretty glum after
hustling Hugh McElhenny made his
spectacular 09 - yard sprint. Faces
were long. And Card rooters tried
to drown their sorrows with a
couple "extras." But interest soared
again as the Big Red Machine
roared back to head for that win
ning teedee.
Only those close to the loud
speakers knew what was going on
when Gary Kerkorian made his
dash after coming close to being
trapped. Screams and cheers got
louder and louder as most thought
Gary had gone all the way. An
other loud roar went up when Bob
Mathias rumbled forward to the
crucial first down on the two-yard
line. Then the score and bedlam.
Huskies Apply Pressure
Tension mounted when Washing
ton came roaring back and threat
ened to tie up the ball game.
Screams came for the "Axe Yell" as
the Huskies got closer and closer.
With only a little over a minute left
and the Indians in possession, root
ers relaxed for a moment.
Unbelievingly close to the final
gun and a fantastic victory, the as
semblage held their collective
breath as the plays unfolded and
the clock ticked awya. Twice the
announcer blasted out about Card
fumbles and the victory - hungry
Red fans moaned.
Glorious Celebration
Suddenly the game was over and
the celebrating really began. Horns
blasted, everybody rushed for cars,
hugging and embracing friends and
strangers alike. There was a rous- ■
ing "Six" for the team in Washing- j
ton, and a tremendous "Coach Yell."
Then the mob broke up and a noisy i
caravan headed back to campus
with horns blasting and voices'
straining.
While the Indian team was far
north in Seattle trying to snare the
elusive Husky, loyal Farm rooters
gathered at Rossotti's and Shangri-
La to cheer their team to the all
important win. Bubbling over with
enthusiasm, happy Stanfordites
combined the fine weather, a play
by-play broadcast, and liquid re
freshments inlo the proverbial per
fect brew on Saturday.
After lunch, plans began to form
to hit either of the rally points.
Some radios had the exciting
Army - Columbia game on; others
put on Stanford songs.
Spirits Pick Up
Out at Rossotti's nearly 200 sat
mound the picnic tables and list
ened to the game being piped over
a public address system. Spirits
