# 'Defense Won It'

### BILL SWIGART Former Daily Editor a Seattle Resident 
"Thank God for the defense,"
sighed youthful Chuck Taylor as he
was surrounded by newsmen and
friends following the Indians' 14 to 7
upset victory over Washington Sat
urday.
"You can say they won it for
he added.
Beaming from ear to ear, although
obviously still somewhat amazed
over his team's sixth straight vic
tory, Taylor admitted that his
weekly prediction of a Stanford vic
tory was getting to be somewhat
of a gag, but said that he would
keep right on predicting.
Taylor Praises Defense
Taylor again praised his defen
sive unit for its fine job in holding
the ever - dangerous Huskies, but
added that he thought the turning
point of the game was quarterback
Gary Kerkorian's break-away run
up the center early in the fourth
quarter after he had been trapped
in atempting to pass on fourth down
and 19 to go. The run carried to a
first down on the Husky 13 from
where Ron Cook and Bob Mathias
carried over on a series of downs.
Chuck pointed out that Washing
ton's heavy rushing tactics forced
the team to change its passing game
and rely a great deal on screens
which worked well. Washington
Coach Howie Odell sorrowfully ad
mitted that his Huskies had over
committed themselves to rush Ker
kojian, and that it probably had
hurt them.
But Odell added that what had
really hurt the Huskies was not be
ing able to move against Stanford's
defense when they needed a few
yards the most.
No Card Injuries
Stanford sufToVcd no additional
injuries, although it was a hard,
bruising game and most of the play
ers wore pretty well battered up.
Bui trainer Connie Jarvis thought
that everyone who played would be
ready for WSC next Saturday.
Washington lost its starting quar
terback Sam Mitchell with an un
determined head injury and bad
knee just after the half. It seems
very unlikely that Washington's
All-America candidate Don Hein
rich will play at all this season, as
Odell will gamble on being able to
get him back for a full season next
year.

weekly prediction of a Stanford vic
tory was getting to be somewhat
of a gag, but said that he would
keep right on predicting.
Taylor Praises Defense
Taylor again praised his defen
sive unit for its fine job in holding
the ever - dangerous Huskies, but
added that he thought the turning
point of the game was quarterback
Gary Kerkorian's break-away run
up the center early in the fourth
quarter after he had been trapped
in atempting to pass on fourth down
and 19 to go. The run carried to a
first down on the Husky 13 from
where Ron Cook and Bob Mathias
carried over on a series of downs.
Chuck pointed out that Washing
ton's heavy rushing tactics forced
the team to change its passing game
and rely a great deal on screens
which worked well. Washington
Coach Howie Odell sorrowfully ad
mitted that his Huskies had over
committed themselves to rush Ker
kojian, and that it probably had
hurt them.
But Odell added that what had
really hurt the Huskies was not be
ing able to move against Stanford's
defense when they needed a few
yards the most.
No Card Injuries
Stanford sufToVcd no additional
injuries, although it was a hard,
bruising game and most of the play
ers wore pretty well battered up.
Bui trainer Connie Jarvis thought
that everyone who played would be
ready for WSC next Saturday.
Washington lost its starting quar
terback Sam Mitchell with an un
determined head injury and bad
knee just after the half. It seems
very unlikely that Washington's
All-America candidate Don Hein
rich will play at all this season, as
Odell will gamble on being able to
get him back for a full season next
year.

E! Toro routed El Campo 25-0
Saturday. Breakers edged El Capi
tan 2 to 0 when a bad center re
sulted in a safety. SAE and Kappa
Sig played to a hard-fought 7-7

i deadlock. The Alpha Dells white- !

j Theta Xi II was doing 'the' some to !
Stern I 7 to 0. The Zetes lost a j
I tight one to Theta Chi G to 2.
"Thank God for the defense,"
sighed youthful Chuck Taylor as he
was surrounded by newsmen and
friends following the Indians' 14 to 7
upset victory over Washington Sat

Beaming from ear to ear, although
obviously still somewhat amazed
over his team's sixth straight vic
tory, Taylor admitted that his
