# PRO AND CAHN
## 
### 
Way back in the middle thirties there was an aggregation of Farm gridders
who pledged never to lose to USC. And for three years running they
stopped the Trojans cold. And for three years they wound up in Pasadena.
These were the VOW BOYS.
In 1940 Albert and Co. amazed all with their show of T-formation razzle,
dazzle, and were promptly clubbed the WOW BOYS. And then in 1949,
Daily sports Editor, John Breier applied the nickname NOW BOYS to a
team which to most seemed destined to go all the way. To many it was then
a case of now or never. They didn't make it.
THE 195! INDIANS—THE HOW BOYS
So today we bring forth the name HOW BOYS to apply to this hard
fighting spirited '51 crew. Just HOW good are they? Just HOW far will they
go? And HOW much can they come up with when they are pressed? Or
HOW hard have they been pressed this year? And HOW has Chuck Taylor
done it?
We are looking for the HOW hoys to go all the way now that they are
over the Washington harrier.
To date Stanford has not been a high scoring, sporadic ball club. We can
recall the high scores run up against weak opponents in past years ... 45,
55, and 73 points were almost the rule rather than the exception in the
"breather" games.
Then came tough games and fizzle outs, no scoring to speak of. But this
year the Indians have scored just what they have needed to win. They
treat "breathers" and "toughies" alike, no piling it on . . . just enough to
win, no more, no less. They have been consistent. Consistency is one of
(he marks of a champion. And it was the Rose Bowl team of 1940 that never
scored more than four touchdowns in any one game. '51 could be a repeater.
POSSIBLE CONFERENCE TIE
There's the possibility that the Conference race may end in a tie neces
sitating a vote for the Rose Bowl representative. A tie would result if Stan
ford and USC each lost one game. This could happen if Stanford beats USC
and then lost to California or it could happen on any other combination
that would place USC and Stanford in a deadlock come Nov. 25. A tie in
the on rushing crucial between the Cards and Trojans with no subsequent
losses by either team would have the same result.
We can't help but think that if such a vote is called upon to decide the
Coast representative, that Stanford would come up the victor when all the
Coast confcrence schools marked their ballots. Perhaps their decision would
he based a bit upon favoritism as well as actual play ability. It seems at this
moment that mighty Southern California is not too popular with Washington,
California or Oregon State because of so called dirty play, and disputed plays.
What's more Stanford plays seven conference games, while USC handles only
six.
ANOTHER NOTE TO RALLY COMMITTEE
It must have been nice for the Conquering Heroes to return to Campus
yesterday at 5 p.m. and have i*b reception of any nature. Rally Committee
could have had some sort of rally or welcome in front of the Athletic Build
ing when the buses arrived. Or at least they could have had a banner blar
ing welcome. Oh, but we forgot Rally Com is tied up planning extravaganzas
for the USC and California games. We can't ask too much of them.
Phil Saeta, former Excom member, comes up with a worthy suggestion.
He asks Rally Com to have the team make a brief group appearance at
Cubberley Auditorium before the Wednesday game movies. All right Rally
Com, it's first down and 10, are you going to kick this one too?

team which to most seemed destined to go all the way. To many it was then
a case of now or never. They didn't make it.
THE 195! INDIANS—THE HOW BOYS
So today we bring forth the name HOW BOYS to apply to this hard
fighting spirited '51 crew. Just HOW good are they? Just HOW far will they
go? And HOW much can they come up with when they are pressed? Or
HOW hard have they been pressed this year? And HOW has Chuck Taylor
done it?
We are looking for the HOW hoys to go all the way now that they are
over the Washington harrier.
To date Stanford has not been a high scoring, sporadic ball club. We can
recall the high scores run up against weak opponents in past years ... 45,
55, and 73 points were almost the rule rather than the exception in the
"breather" games.
Then came tough games and fizzle outs, no scoring to speak of. But this
year the Indians have scored just what they have needed to win. They
treat "breathers" and "toughies" alike, no piling it on . . . just enough to
win, no more, no less. They have been consistent. Consistency is one of
(he marks of a champion. And it was the Rose Bowl team of 1940 that never
scored more than four touchdowns in any one game. '51 could be a repeater.
POSSIBLE CONFERENCE TIE
There's the possibility that the Conference race may end in a tie neces
sitating a vote for the Rose Bowl representative. A tie would result if Stan
ford and USC each lost one game. This could happen if Stanford beats USC
and then lost to California or it could happen on any other combination
that would place USC and Stanford in a deadlock come Nov. 25. A tie in
the on rushing crucial between the Cards and Trojans with no subsequent
losses by either team would have the same result.
We can't help but think that if such a vote is called upon to decide the
Coast representative, that Stanford would come up the victor when all the
Coast confcrence schools marked their ballots. Perhaps their decision would
he based a bit upon favoritism as well as actual play ability. It seems at this
moment that mighty Southern California is not too popular with Washington,
California or Oregon State because of so called dirty play, and disputed plays.
What's more Stanford plays seven conference games, while USC handles only
six.
ANOTHER NOTE TO RALLY COMMITTEE
It must have been nice for the Conquering Heroes to return to Campus
yesterday at 5 p.m. and have i*b reception of any nature. Rally Committee
could have had some sort of rally or welcome in front of the Athletic Build
ing when the buses arrived. Or at least they could have had a banner blar
ing welcome. Oh, but we forgot Rally Com is tied up planning extravaganzas
for the USC and California games. We can't ask too much of them.
Phil Saeta, former Excom member, comes up with a worthy suggestion.
He asks Rally Com to have the team make a brief group appearance at
Cubberley Auditorium before the Wednesday game movies. All right Rally
Com, it's first down and 10, are you going to kick this one too?
Way back in the middle thirties there was an aggregation of Farm gridders
who pledged never to lose to USC. And for three years running they
stopped the Trojans cold. And for three years they wound up in Pasadena.
These were the VOW BOYS.
In 1940 Albert and Co. amazed all with their show of T-formation razzle,
dazzle, and were promptly clubbed the WOW BOYS. And then in 1949,
Daily sports Editor, John Breier applied the nickname NOW BOYS to a
team which to most seemed destined to go all the way. To many it was then
a case of now or never. They didn't make it.
