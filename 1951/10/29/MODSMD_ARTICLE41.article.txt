# Coast Grid Teams Raise Intersectional Win Record
## 
### KENT HALLAWELL 
The pre-season football "exhibi
tions" are over and teams across the
nation are now confining their Sat
urday afternoons to battles within
their respective conferences, all
hoping to earn berths in the post
season "exhibitions." But, to the
West Coast football fan, all isn't so
simple; something has been added.
For a number of years Far West
ern teams have taken their system
atic whippings both in pre-season
and in post-season intersectionals.
The disastrous five-year Rose Bowl
pact was only one example.
But not so in '51. A quick scan
over the record book shows that
out of 12 important intersectionals
the Coasters have copped an amaz
ing eight. Even more startling is the
record of four wins against two
losses compiled by Pacific Coast
Conference teams at the expense of
the "invincible" Big Ten.

Certainly California's impressive
wins over Pennsylvania and Minne
sota contributed a great deal to the
West Coast record. But take away
j the Bears, who as one of the top
j teams in the nation were expected
to take the Quakers and the Go
phers, and you still have a fine rec
ord, in which are included several
upset victories.
Stanford over Michigan; Wash
ington over Minnesota; Washington
State over Oklahoma A&M; Loyola
over Florida; and College of Pa
cific's wins over Hardin - Simmons
and Clemson—these were the West
Coast victories. The losses—Oregon
State to Michigan State, a pair by
UCLA to Illinois and Texas A&M.

This could be a sign of better

j a big build-up for another big let
