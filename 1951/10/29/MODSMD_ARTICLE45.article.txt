# Reading Comprehension Stressed at Study Clinic
## 
### BARNEY GLASER 
Are you having trouble with
your studying? Do you find it
hard to concentrate, to compre
hend, and to interpret accurately
while reading? Do you feel you
would like to improve your gen
eral study habits but don't quite
know how to go about it?
If you are running into these
problems, come to the Counseling
and Testing Center and inquire
about enrolling in the Study Skills
Clinic.
The clinic deals with the develop
mental rather than the remedial ap
! proach to the problem of teaching
study skills. This means people at
any level of reading are welcome to
come and try to improve their abil
ity.
The main emphasis in the course

is on comprehension and develop
ment of reading skills and not on
speed, which just naturally picks up
as comprehension improves. Also,
vocabulary building from the stand
point of word analysis is stressed.
Techniques Taught
Some of the techniques taught in
the classes are skimming, reading
for details, interpretation of data,
critical thinking, studv habits in
general, and specific skills for read- j
ing in the content fields.
Anyone interested in improving j
his reading skills should consult [
Henry Bamman, co-ordinator of the j
Study Skills Clinic, whose office is
at the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter. Enrollment in the classes, which i
meet three hours a week, is strictly j
voluntary and, of course, no unit
credit is given. They are limited fo I
as to insure individual attention for ;
every participant.
Regular Classes Join
Ten sections will be listed for the I
first time in this winter's time J
schedule and students can sign up j
for them as they do for regular '
classes.
Many years students have conic j
1o the Counseling Center with read- I
ing and studying problems. There !
were no facilities for helping them j
except to take them on as individ- j
ual cases. This was expensive and
very limited.
The demand for more help in- |
creased to the point where more
adequate measures had to be taken.
Therefore, in the spring of 1950 an
experimental class of 15 was start- j
cd, in spite of the fact there was no
budget provision to help them.
Center Reorganized
During summer quarter the class
was forgotten as the Counseling and
Testing Center was being reorgan
ized. But in the fall of 1950 three
trained and experienced volunteers
were secured. Thirty-five students
were accepted and the course was
resumed with still no budget aid.

| Once again this system proved a
) success, and by the end of fall
j quarter there was a big waiting list.
Sixty-five students were enrolled
! for winter '51 and enough money
was tapped from the budget this
time to give the volunteers a small
financial return.
| In the spring, 90 students were
j accepted and the course was run
J on the same basis.
103 Students Now
This fall 103 students were ad-
I mitted and although there is as yet
no direct monetary provision the
counseling administration felt that
it was important enough to c.ivert a
large block of the general budget
to the Study Skills Clinic.
Now the clinic start consists of
two paid workers, and seven grad-
I uate students who get unit credit
J and practical experience for their
I services. All nine are working for
j doctoral degrees in the School of
1 Education, which collaborates with
the Counseling and Testing" Center
! in preparing this training program.

mental rather than the remedial ap
! proach to the problem of teaching
study skills. This means people at
any level of reading are welcome to
come and try to improve their abil
ity.
The main emphasis in the course

is on comprehension and develop
ment of reading skills and not on
speed, which just naturally picks up
as comprehension improves. Also,
vocabulary building from the stand
point of word analysis is stressed.
Techniques Taught
Some of the techniques taught in
the classes are skimming, reading
for details, interpretation of data,
critical thinking, studv habits in
general, and specific skills for read- j
ing in the content fields.
Anyone interested in improving j
his reading skills should consult [
Henry Bamman, co-ordinator of the j
Study Skills Clinic, whose office is
at the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter. Enrollment in the classes, which i
meet three hours a week, is strictly j
voluntary and, of course, no unit
credit is given. They are limited fo I
as to insure individual attention for ;
every participant.
Regular Classes Join
Ten sections will be listed for the I
first time in this winter's time J
schedule and students can sign up j
for them as they do for regular '
classes.
Many years students have conic j
1o the Counseling Center with read- I
ing and studying problems. There !
were no facilities for helping them j
except to take them on as individ- j
ual cases. This was expensive and
very limited.
The demand for more help in- |
creased to the point where more
adequate measures had to be taken.
Therefore, in the spring of 1950 an
experimental class of 15 was start- j
cd, in spite of the fact there was no
budget provision to help them.
Center Reorganized
During summer quarter the class
was forgotten as the Counseling and
Testing Center was being reorgan
ized. But in the fall of 1950 three
trained and experienced volunteers
were secured. Thirty-five students
were accepted and the course was
resumed with still no budget aid.

| Once again this system proved a
) success, and by the end of fall
j quarter there was a big waiting list.
Sixty-five students were enrolled
! for winter '51 and enough money
was tapped from the budget this
time to give the volunteers a small
financial return.
| In the spring, 90 students were
j accepted and the course was run
J on the same basis.
103 Students Now
This fall 103 students were ad-
I mitted and although there is as yet
no direct monetary provision the
counseling administration felt that
it was important enough to c.ivert a
large block of the general budget
to the Study Skills Clinic.
Now the clinic start consists of
two paid workers, and seven grad-
I uate students who get unit credit
J and practical experience for their
I services. All nine are working for
j doctoral degrees in the School of
1 Education, which collaborates with
the Counseling and Testing" Center
! in preparing this training program.
