## 
### 
"We have a real stake in these
charities," drives committee mem
ber Jackie Harris this week com
mented about the Palo Alto Com
munity Chest and the American
Cancer Society, the organizations
which will receive the money col
lected at Stanford this week in the
fall all-campus charity drive.
Quota for the drive is $1 per per
son. Living group representatives
will collect donations today through
Friday.
Only additional money-gathering
event will be a horror movie Friday
night in Cubberley Auditorium at
7, 9, and 11. Tickets will be sold for
50 cents at a tahle in front of the
Cellar from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. this
week.
Cancer Society Important
Miss Harris, a member of the
committee which investigated the
charities on which Stanford's only
fund drive of the quarter is being
based, pointed out the following
reasons why the Cancer Society is a
cause close to home:
1. Cancer appears in all age
groupsâ€”not just among the middle
aged.
2. While 175,000 Americans die of
cancer every year, more than 1,600
of these deaths are reported for
young people under 20 years of age.
Of every dollar given to the Can
cer Fund, a quarter pays for re
search through fellowships and
grants, fiO ccnts stays in the donor's
area to pay for information services
and loral aid, and 15 cents goes to
the national office for administra

tion and such national services as
a library and conferences, training
schools, and institutions.
Resoarrh Money
The money for research also has
a special local significance, because
of grants to the Stanford Research
Institute. The Palo Alto Commu
nity Chest, which will get 60 per
J cent of the money collected, is also
: directly connected with Stanford,
because the Farm YWCA is one of
j the Chest's member agencies.
Other groups in the Paly organi
zation are: Palo Alto YWCA and
YMCA, Palo Alto Girl Scouts and
Roy Scouts, Family Service Asso
ciation, and Youth Co-ordinating
! Council.
