It's that time of year again.
Frosh are building the "biggest ever" bonfire, Ram's Head is rehears
ing Gaieties, Stanford women are hoping every phone call will be a Big
Game date, and Cardinals have come up with a Big Game theme.
After two hours of discussion and more than a week of thought, the
powers that Cardinals be have reached into their collective mind and
decided on "Beware Bear, The Cards Are Stacked Against You" as the
theme of the second consecutive Big Game Thanksgiving week.
It was no easy task for the Cardinals, who considered more than a
score of possible themes before settling on the one ultimately chosen.
There were witty themes and not-so-witty themes; rhyming ones and
prosaic ones; "catchy" ones and slippery ones; funny ones and punny ones.
"Golden Bear Target for Indian Arrow" was the original choice of the
group, but within 15 minutes it was rejected for "Beware Bear, etc.,"
because it was not sufficiently catchy. The former was then relegated to
potential house-decoration theme, but a reshuffling produced "Big Card
Game Brings Injun (Indian) Fame" as decorations theme.
One of the last to go down was "Axe The Man Who Owns One." Car
dinal dismissed themes such as this on the theory that something "straight"
would bo better. The collectivc opinion was that many students hadn't
understood subtle ones of the past, such as last year's "Thanksgiving
Indian Out for Big Game."
Other suggestions that fell out of the running early were;
"Bow Now, Brown Bear," "Indian Chief Brings Bear Grief," "Indian
Squaws Clip Bear Claws," "Bears Bow-Wow Doesn't Scare Indian's Pow
Wow," and "Let's Get Waldorf's Astoria."
