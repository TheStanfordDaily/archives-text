# Only Ten Minutes, A Pint: One Life
## The
						Story of Your Blood 
### SUE WHEAT 
This is the story of a pint of
blood. It ends with a man
crumpled in the mud of a shell
pocketed ridge in Korea. But "it
begins with you.
It brains when you walk into the
Women's Clubhouse tomorrow —
maybe clutching your appointment
slip in sweaty fingers if you have
j never donated blood before.
Gray Ladies and Red Cross staff
aides check your blood pressure,
pul.se, and hemoglobin, and in the
atmosphere of friendliness and effi
ciency your apprehensions soon
i vanish.
renounced eligible to give
your blood, you take your placc
with other donors lying on rows
of spotless white cots. A nurse
gently slips a needle into a vein
in your arm and a.s you lie back
and worry about your Econ mid
term. a bottle bv the side of your
cot is slowly filled.
In about ten minutes, the bottle
is filled—one pint. It is one pint
j out of the .'500,000 pints that the Red
i Cross must collect every month to
| supply the demand in Korea and to
replenish the nation's dangerously
diminishing supply of plasma.
In less than an hour, you arc
strolling the campus again, sport
ing a pin showing that you have
given, and eager to bore innocent.
: acquaintances with a play-by-play
I account of your "experience."

Your blood meanwhile is being
driven to testing laboratories where
it is typed, sealed, and packed. If
it is type O, it is packed in iee and
shipped to Korea immediately as
whole blood. Other types are made
into plasma which can be stored in
definitely. Whole blood only, how
ever, contains living cells and is
much superior to plasma in the
treatment of wounds and shock.
Several days and plane stops
later, the pint of whole blood,
crated with hundreds of others,
arrives at a base in Korea. An
Army truck rushes the precious
cargo over bumpy dirt roads. As
it rumbles into a mobile hospital,
enrpsmen and nurses hurrv out
of tents and lug the crates inside.
Your pint of blood is among those
unpacked in the Held tent. In the
tent soldiers arc lying on blood
stained stretchers. One has had his
logs blown off by a grenade bursting
at his fret. He is suffering from
shock and is almost dead from loss
of blood.
A nurse picks up the pint of your
blood. She plunges a tube through
the cork of the bottle and with the
aid of a needle inserts the other end
into the soldier's arm vein. The
bottle empties, and she repeats this
process using five or six pints be
fore color comes back to the man's
face and movement to his limbs. He
will now have a chance to live.
And that is the end of the .story
of a pint of blood.
