# Stanford Drives Com Will Get Recognition
## 
### 
Stanford's Drives Committee will soon receive national recog
nition through the American Cancer Society.
Mrs. Frances B. Harris, the Society's Palo Alto representative,
Friday informed Elinor Yancey, chairman of the current all-campus
charity drive, that the Farm committee will be the subject of an

article in the cancer organization's I
national bulletin. v
"The first of its kind at any col
lege in the West," Mrs. Harris j
termed the group which was set up I
by ASSU Excom last spring. Its I
purposes include investigating and
picking the charities for the campus j
drives, conducting the campaigns, j
and maintaining a file of pertinent |
information.
Mrs. Harris became acquainted
with the Farm Drives Committee i
earlier this quarter, when she gave |
them information on the American j
Cancer Society, which is receiving !
40 per cent of the collection from i
the current drive.
After being subjected to an hour- j
long quizzing on the society's work, ]
she expressed her enthusiasm for i
the drives group's purposes and !
commented, "I wish more schools <
did this."
The bulletin may achieve Mrs. \
Harris's wish, because it will go to J
schools all over the nation.
