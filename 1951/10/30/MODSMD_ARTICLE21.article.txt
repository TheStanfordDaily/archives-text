# B-DAY
## Red Cross Blood Unit Here Today 
### 
Today is B-Dav. Starting at R
this morning, over 500 Stanford
students who responded so gener
ously to the call for blood donors
will file into the Women's Club
house to give their blood.
Ushering them through the in
minute donation process will 'be
doctors, nurses, nurses' aides, Gray
Ladies, canteen workers, and stu
dent assistants, the people forming
a Red Cross mobile blood donor
unit.
Bring Slips
Blood donations will continue
throughout the day until 5. Stu
dents are asked to come promptly
at the hours designated on their
appointment slips and to bring their
slips with them when they come.
Students intending to donate their
blood should not eat anything but,
fruit juccs or cofTee (no cream) for
four hours before giving.
The donations that Stanford will
make today are just a fraction of
the amount of blood that the Red
Cross is appealing for. Blood sup
plies are low in Korea and here at
home. To avoid the danger of a
complete depletion of reserves, the
Red Cross must secure 300,000 pints
a month.
Weak Response
Civilian response to the call has
been late and feeble. Americans
have been giving about half the
amount they are being asked for.
The students who walk out of the
Women's Clubhouse wearing the
pins of donors today can justly feel
that they have helped to change the
public's indifferent, response to an
overwhelming one.
