# Alumni Review Hits Football
## 
### 
In its November issue the Stan
ford University Alumni Review
took a slam at "semi-professional
practices" in collegiate football and
called upon the Pacific Coast Con
ference to "pioneer reforms," the
United Press reported yesterday.
'The Pacific Coast Conference
can assume the leadership in pre
serving the game on a basis of
genuine amateur sportsmanship
and in its rightful perspective as
an extra-curricular activity of in
stitutions devoted primarily to
higher education." said the maga
zine.
"The conference should agree
promptly to pioneer in reforms,
even at the risk of placing PCC
schools at a disadvantage in inter
sectional games. A major league
already respected for its written
codc of conduct, the PCC can stand
on its own feet in correcting
abuses."
All schools are not guilty o{
"semi-professional practices." the
magazine said, hut all have a
share in the responsibility.
"College football—laboring 011 a
treadmill of heavy expenses that too
often seemingly must be> met by
winning teams and big ticket sales
— has long been guilty of under
the-table, semi-professional prac
tices," said the Review.
