# Dollar Per Student Is Charity Goal
## 
### 
Stanford's first charity drive of the year is
underway this week. The goal is a simple one
one dollar per student or about $7,500.
An extra lot of planning has been put into
this drive which will send money to the Palo
Alto Stanford Community Chest and the Ameri
can Cancer Society. Past drives have failed
badly; Stanford has made the poorest showing
ol any major school on the Coast, falling far
behind such institutions as Cal. And this from
a school with such a high proportion of well
to do students!
In an effort to find out why Stanford responds
so grudgingly to charity campaigns, a special
drives committee discovered two things. First,
students are loath to support a drive when they
can't see where the money is going; Second,
students don't like to be "bothered" with many
little events during a drive.
The Fall Relief Drive Committee has catered

to student wishes. In answer to the first point,
they emphasize that money from the Commun
ity Chest comes back to Stanford directly
through help to the campus YWCA. The Uni
versity also gets direct grants from the cancer
society for research.
In answer to the second point, the drive this
guarter will have no tag days, no dinner col
lections, nothing but individual solicitation and
one end-of-the-week movie. Nobody will be
bothered.
Thus the fall drive has cut out the principal
student objections. As we see it, there can be
only one gripe left—students don't like to be
asked to give up their money to help others.
This gripe no committee can correct. It's an
individual problem. And it's on the individual
level that charity drives succeed or fail. Let's
hope that 7,500 students acting as individuals
make Stanford as a group look a bit more chari
table this fall.
