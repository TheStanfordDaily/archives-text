### DICK McLEAN 
HOW TO IMPRESS A FRESHMAN GIRL
There was one Bull Session earlier in the quarter
concerning facts that every freshman girl should know.
1 have been bitterly attacked for this (among other
things) by certain male members of the student body.
So in order to right myself with these men and to add
a little spice to the never ending conflict of woman
versus man, I now outline (in detail) "How to Impress
ii Freshman Girl."

Here are the steps in chrono
logical sequence:
1) Borrow a classy car. Buick
or Cadillac convertibles are fine
for impression purposes. Jaguars
arc especially good because you
can casually remark, "Picked it
up on the Continent this sum
mer."
Once you've borrowed the car,
slop it up with mud and dust,
'fliis will give the appearance

you're so used to wealth and the finer things, that
you can treat them with casual indifference.
2) Take the friend's auto down to the Friendly Loan
Company in Palo Alto and see how much you can
borrow on it. Nothing is quite as smooth as to reach
in your pocket for a dime and come out with a careless
fistful of hundred dollar bills.
3) Remove the inside handles and the arm rest on
her side of the car. Next grease the seat slightly. With
a well mapped out route of sharp right hand turns
she'll helplessly slide over next to you. If she tries to
j'Ct away, turn the heater on to "Deepfreeze."
4) Dress casually. This will give that essential flavor
that distinguishes a rough from a rogue. Wear a dark
blue suit with a plaid, terry-cloth beach shirt under
neath. Or if you like, go eastern. Wear a seersucker
coat, dark flannels, a button down collar, and a strictly
regimental tie. With this outfit a mild Harvard accent.
Parliament (filtered) Cigarettes, and tennis shoes add
nicely.
5) Take the Impressionable youngster to a French
tnovie at the Guild Theatre. If she's taking her
language at Stanford, it's a cinch that you can be

safe in pretending you understand every word.
Laugh your head off regardless of what the titles
say. When everyone else laughs, be silent and
morose. She'll think you're a deep thinker.
(i) After the show go to L'Omelettes. (Refer to it
as the "Egg.") Say hello to everyone you see. (Most
Stanford people will' answer whether they know you
or not.) She will immediately think, "This man is a
real BMOC. (Big Man on Campus.) Say something to
the proprietor in French and he will immediately
bubble, "Monsieur, monsieur, it is good to see you
again." (After all it's the poor guy's job.)
7) Drink something different. Don't be plebian and
drink beer (even eastern) or ordinary, everyday
Scotch. Drink something like Kalua or Pernod (pro
nounced Pair-no) over ice. The stuff tastes like wild
licorice and rye seed but if you hold your nose, you
can get it down with gagging.
8) If she asks what was said in the movie, wave
her off with a vague gesture and a blush. This will
explain that it was so racy that you can't talk about
it. She'll think. "He is a man of the world, but sen
sitive and discreet."
9) Dominate the conversation. If she begins to sound
the slightest bit learned, jump the conversation to the
third quarter of Western Civilization. She won't have
reached it yet and will think you're u genius.
10) Plan your time. Make sure that you get back
in front of Roble or Branner twenty minutes early.
At this time you should suggest just one cigarette and
whip out one of those fifty cent Turkish jobs about
nine inches long. With careful puffing they last about
half an hour.
So there you are. old man. You're parked in a
beautiful car with the radio murmuring something
low. The top's down and she's sitting over close
beside you. She (the poor dear) is all starry-eyed
and "snowed" with your debonair air and casual
manner.
You've done your job well.
If you can't take the ball from here, boy, just turn
in your blue cards and transfer to California. After
all, there are some things you've got to learn for your
self.

coat, dark flannels, a button down collar, and a strictly
regimental tie. With this outfit a mild Harvard accent.
Parliament (filtered) Cigarettes, and tennis shoes add
nicely.
5) Take the Impressionable youngster to a French
tnovie at the Guild Theatre. If she's taking her
language at Stanford, it's a cinch that you can be

safe in pretending you understand every word.
Laugh your head off regardless of what the titles
say. When everyone else laughs, be silent and
morose. She'll think you're a deep thinker.
(i) After the show go to L'Omelettes. (Refer to it
as the "Egg.") Say hello to everyone you see. (Most
Stanford people will' answer whether they know you
or not.) She will immediately think, "This man is a
real BMOC. (Big Man on Campus.) Say something to
the proprietor in French and he will immediately
bubble, "Monsieur, monsieur, it is good to see you
again." (After all it's the poor guy's job.)
7) Drink something different. Don't be plebian and
drink beer (even eastern) or ordinary, everyday
Scotch. Drink something like Kalua or Pernod (pro
nounced Pair-no) over ice. The stuff tastes like wild
licorice and rye seed but if you hold your nose, you
can get it down with gagging.
8) If she asks what was said in the movie, wave
her off with a vague gesture and a blush. This will
explain that it was so racy that you can't talk about
it. She'll think. "He is a man of the world, but sen
sitive and discreet."
9) Dominate the conversation. If she begins to sound
the slightest bit learned, jump the conversation to the
third quarter of Western Civilization. She won't have
reached it yet and will think you're u genius.
10) Plan your time. Make sure that you get back
in front of Roble or Branner twenty minutes early.
At this time you should suggest just one cigarette and
whip out one of those fifty cent Turkish jobs about
nine inches long. With careful puffing they last about
half an hour.
So there you are. old man. You're parked in a
beautiful car with the radio murmuring something
low. The top's down and she's sitting over close
beside you. She (the poor dear) is all starry-eyed
and "snowed" with your debonair air and casual
manner.
You've done your job well.
If you can't take the ball from here, boy, just turn
in your blue cards and transfer to California. After
all, there are some things you've got to learn for your
self.

HOW TO IMPRESS A FRESHMAN GIRL
There was one Bull Session earlier in the quarter
concerning facts that every freshman girl should know.
1 have been bitterly attacked for this (among other
things) by certain male members of the student body.
So in order to right myself with these men and to add
a little spice to the never ending conflict of woman
versus man, I now outline (in detail) "How to Impress
ii Freshman Girl."

Here are the steps in chrono
logical sequence:
1) Borrow a classy car. Buick
or Cadillac convertibles are fine
for impression purposes. Jaguars
arc especially good because you
can casually remark, "Picked it
up on the Continent this sum
mer."
Once you've borrowed the car,
slop it up with mud and dust,
'fliis will give the appearance

you're so used to wealth and the finer things, that
you can treat them with casual indifference.
2) Take the friend's auto down to the Friendly Loan
Company in Palo Alto and see how much you can
borrow on it. Nothing is quite as smooth as to reach
in your pocket for a dime and come out with a careless
fistful of hundred dollar bills.
3) Remove the inside handles and the arm rest on
her side of the car. Next grease the seat slightly. With
a well mapped out route of sharp right hand turns
she'll helplessly slide over next to you. If she tries to
j'Ct away, turn the heater on to "Deepfreeze."
4) Dress casually. This will give that essential flavor
that distinguishes a rough from a rogue. Wear a dark
blue suit with a plaid, terry-cloth beach shirt under
neath. Or if you like, go eastern. Wear a seersucker
coat, dark flannels, a button down collar, and a strictly
regimental tie. With this outfit a mild Harvard accent.
Parliament (filtered) Cigarettes, and tennis shoes add
nicely.
5) Take the Impressionable youngster to a French
tnovie at the Guild Theatre. If she's taking her
