## Where's Rally Com? 
### 
To the Editor:
Congratulations to the best team in our four years
at Stanford. But where is RALLY COM? Our team
is doing their part and the students would like to do
theirs too, but they need organization to put on rallies
and welcomings. Rally Com is supposed to be this
organization.
In addition to planning extravaganzas for SC and
Cal, why not give the students a chance to express
their praise lor their team. The Washington State
game is no time to let down. WSC almost tied Cal
42-35 and did very well against SC. Our winning team

I
deserves a rally. Do v/e have to plan it ourselves?
