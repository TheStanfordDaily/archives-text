### 
CISTEL C.ANDOLFO, Italy â€”All
forms of birth control, natural or
artificial, including the so - called
"rhythmic cycle," were placcd out
of bounds to Catholics today by
Pius XII.
"Any attempt which has the aim
of impeding procreation is immor
al." the pontifT said in a meticulous
ly detailed address to a group of
Italian obstetricians and midwives.
If a Catholic woman runs the risk
of death in conceiving, the Pope de
clared, then total sexual abstinence
is the mandate of the church.
