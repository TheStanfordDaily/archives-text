"A Streetcar Named Desire,"
I currently at the Varsity, rates its
three puffs because it is an ex
ample of moviemaking at its fin
est. Its faults, in other words,
are not those of Hollywood, but
those of Tennessee Williams,
who unhappily ignored his op
portunity to improve his play in
adapting it for the screen.
The play's main flaw—and it is a
basic one —is that it isn't really
drama, or even melodrama, but
mprijiv «» i»c\/_

merely a psy
chological case
history. In the
entire play there
is not a single
character who is
not in some way
unbalanced,
maladjusted, or
perverted.

Blanche Dußois is a nymphoma
; niac. Her sister, Stella, is essential -
j ly the same, even though she has
found a solution to her problem in
Stanley Kowalski, who in turn is
animalistic and sub-human. Mitch,
who courts, then rejects Blanche,
has a mother fixation. And even as
minor a character as the paper boy
is somehow strange and of another
world.
