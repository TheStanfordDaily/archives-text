# No Identification
## 
### 
Obviously, then, the play is with- |
out a frame of reference and the I
audience is provided with no point I
of identification whatsoever. Never !
are we drawn into the action to
feel or experience it. Consequently,
the play can hold no meaning for
us.
All of this is unfortunate, since
the treatment "Streetcar" has been
given is worthy of a great motion
picture. Elia Kazan's direction, to
be sure, is a trifle stagebound. Sel
dom moving his camera away from |
the Kowalski flat, he soon runs out i
of corners to probe into and must '
resort to almost continual closeups
of the actors, so that some of their j
speeches become monotonous and

talky. This happens only occasion
ally, however, and otherwise the
direction is excellent, the photogra
phy superb.
As for the acting, it is unquali
fiedly outstanding. Confronted with
the almost insurmountable task of
showing Blanche's degeneration
from scene to scene, Vivien Leigh is
brilliantly successful. And if Mar
lon Brando's unique style of acting
will prove limited as his screen ca
reer wears on, he is certainly per
fect as Stanley. Kim Hunter and
Karl Maiden as Stella and Mitch
j round out a bevy of truly top-flight
| performances.
