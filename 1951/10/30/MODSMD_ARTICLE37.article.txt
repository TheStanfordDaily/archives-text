## Punts and Pitches Hail the Cinderella Team 
### 
Our assignment was to cover the Cal-OSC game last week.
But in all honesty we otmnot tell you with accuracy what happened on ;
the field at Berkeley last Saturday, because at our side was a portable J
radio tuned to the Stanford-Washington game. We felt like the guy play
ing two games of chess at the same time . . . but not being able to con- !
centrate on one of them.
The Bears' Bill Powell set a new Cal record by racing 98 yards from the !
line of scrimmage. Or at least, that's what we read in the Green Sheet the
next day. At the time, we were too busy knocking our head against the
Berkeley bleachers, Stanford just having fumbled away a scoring oppor
tunity.
When Zenith told us that Gary Kerkorian flipped a touchdown pass to
Bill McColl on fourth down, we leaped into the air with a rousing cheer.
This somewhat puzzled the Cal sympathizers sitting near us, for there was
exceedingly little going on down on the field. Cal had just called a time out, !
and although the water boy did run out with a lot of hustle, it wasn't an
event calling for the emphasis we seemingly gave it.
We do submit that there were two teams down on the field . . . one
in blue and gold, the other in white and orange. For further information, j
refer to the Green Sheet.
After the game, we interviewed Pappy Waldorf and informed him that j
Stanford had beaten Washington. "What kind of a chance does th;it give
Stanford against USC?" we asked the Big One. knowing darn well that
Cal had bowed to the Trojans.
Good-natured Pappy may have the girth of an elephant, but he shows
the dexterity of a snake in wiggling off the hook. After a long pause, he I
allowed, "It should be a good game."
We told Pappy that we wouldn't let him beg oil with an equivocal state- <
ment like that, so he elaborated: "You have to give Chuck Taylor credit for
;t tremendous coaching job. He must have done a good job replacing those
key injured men today. Our scout reports show that Stanford is getting
stronger and stronger every game, and they are a very rough ball club."
All of which brings us to our next point. To put it very bluntly, we
feel quite confident that Stanford is going to the Hose Bowl.
We are of this opinion, because you can't mention the 1951 Stanford
Cinderella team without using the phrase "clutch performers." We men
tioned this last week. We are sure of it now. Stanford fumbled, and had
penalties called against them, but when the chips were down, they came
through. It's fourth and 15 on the Washington 15. Washington, sensing a
pass, puts a forest of defenders on McColl. Kerkorian throws, McColl hurtles
that massive body of his in the air, challenges the ball, juggles it, and
splashes into the canvas field cover with a touchdown. A come-through
performance.
It's the fourth quarter now and the score is tied. It's fourth down and
15 to go on the Husky 32. Kerkorian wheels back to pass, but his receivers
are covered. He sees an opening, hits for it, and before he is brought down,
he has lour more yards than he needed for a first down. A come-through
performance. Cook scores a teedee a few plays later.
The greatest clutch work was by the defense, which came into its own
last Saturday. Washington's great running attack is stopped cold on the
Stanford four yard line in the first half. It's the fourth quarter, and Stanford
has the plush of victory in its grasp, when the Huskies start driving to tie
the count. Three minutes to go, and Washington has powered to the Card 16.
It's fourth down and a foot to go. The great Hugh McElhenny is given the
ball, and knowing this is the deciding play of the game, he pistols his 200
pound frame at the Stanford line. He is met cold, and tries to slither off
to the side. Soph Ted Tanner, a modest kid with a shy, infectious grin off
the field but a demon on the field, diagnoses McElhenny's move and meets
him head on and Stanford takes the ball on downs. A come-through per
formance.
That's why we have to stick with that gang of Chuck Taylor's. When ]
things look the darkest . . . that's when you can expect them to pull victory !
out of the fire.
Mr. Odell, I'll buy that Hose Bowl tie.
