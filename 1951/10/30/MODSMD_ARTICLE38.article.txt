# Card Polo Team Takes 10-5 Win
## 
### 
Stanford's polo team won its sec
ond game of the season when it beat
Palo Alto 10 tu 5 in a hard-fought
game Sunday in Golden Gate Park.
Alex Eehavarria led the Stanford
attack with four goals. Allan Sehe- !
rer, captain of the team, and Bob !
MeCreery each made three.
The fog was so thick in the Park
that the team had to adopt white
red-tipped feathers on their hats to
distinguish them from their oppo
nents.
r l iie Cards' next games will be the
biggest of the season, a two-game
series on Nov. 10 and 11 against
Mew Mexico Military Institute. The j
teams will vie in an annual battle j
for the trophy donated by NMMI j
Coach and Mrs. Thompson which j
the NMMI boys won last year.
