# Cards Ready for Cougars; Injury Situation Bright
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
There was good news on the
gridiron front last night as reports
from training quarters indicated
that the Indians will very likely
face the Washington State Cougars
this Saturday in the best physical
condition of the season.
Although a host or minor injuries
were incurred in last week's upset
win at Seattle, they were nothing
more than "the usual bumps from a
hard - fought game," according to
trainer Connie Jarvis. Only Norm
Manoogian will miss any practices
as a result of the Seattle affair, but
his bruised light leg should recover
fully in time for Wednesday's drill.
Also ready again for full - time
duty is rugged guard Jess Cone,
who missed the entire Santa Clara
game and was reduced to part-time
work last week by his Bruin-in
cuired knee injury. Jess still favors
the bad knee but should be in top
shape by Saturday.
The usual light Monday practice
featured fundamentals for the of
fensive unit, while the defense ran
through a dummy drill against basic
Cougar patterns as set up by the
Braves. WSC operates off a basic
single - wing formation with fre
quent plays off the T.
The gridders adjourned early to
hear a scouting report on the north
ern invaders and to view movies of
Saturday's 14 to 7 win over the
Huskies.
The remainder of the week will
see heavier action, as Chuck Tay
lor prepares his squad for what
Taylor has classed as a tougher
hurdle than the Washington tiff.
The Indians' main task will be that
of stopping Byron Bailey, senior
halfback from Seattle, who can run
and pass with the best on the
coast.
Bailey, also a very definite threat
as a pass receiver, scored twice in
the Cougars' 41 to 6 manhandling of
Oregon last week, one on a 63-yard
solo sprint.
