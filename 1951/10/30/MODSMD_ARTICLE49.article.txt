# Fifty-one Hopefuls Turn Out for Crew; Six Lettermen Return to Anchor Squad
## 
### DAN HEIL 
Training has begun for the Stan
ford crew for the school year 1951-
52. Thirty-five freshmen are trying
out and will add to the 26 men re
turning from last year. Returning
lettermen from last year include
Jim Fifer (stroke), Bob McGary
(number 7 man), Dewey Hecht
(number G), Hal Campen (number
5), "Chief" Hendrickson (number
3), and Captain Ken Lewis (num
ber 1). These men and last year's
frosh team have had experience
against the University of Washing
ton and the University of California j
crews, rated numbers one and two i
in the nation last year.
Stanford's crew is an independent
organization which is not supported
by the University. Last year the
Stanford Athletic Board refused the
crew an expense account of $5,O(K>.
The budget for the University of
California crew was $45,000 last
year. Stanford crew members have
j to obtain the money from alumni
| and friends. The individual mem
j bers even have to pay for their own
j passage to and from meets.
Last year, the Stanford crew was
given a chance to race the number
one Washington crew at Seattle,
j But the Stanford crew could not

raise enough money for the trip
north. Fortunately, a Seattle news
paperman raised the desired
amount from Seattle contributions,
and the crew made the trip. On this
same trip the frosh crew paid their
own way.
The men out for crew at Stan
ford have many problems that are
I not monetary, such as equipment
and time. Equipment must he
kept in proper running condition,
and the men who work on the
equipment are the same men who
row in* the first and second boats
I on race davs.
When the crew members are not
' working on equipment or trying lo
find money for their next trip, they
are practicing. Up at 5 a.m. during
winter quarter doesn't sound very
attractive, and it isn't. Easter vaca
tion is not spent at a Southern Cali
fornia beach or at home, but here ai
Stanford where the crew rows twice
a day.
The Stanford Crew Auxiliary is
an organization of Stanford coeds
, who spend time writing letters lo
alumni and giving publicity to the
| crew.
The Stanford crew Is still a suc
sessful Stanford sports represen
tative despite the lack of mone
tary support from tin* University.
