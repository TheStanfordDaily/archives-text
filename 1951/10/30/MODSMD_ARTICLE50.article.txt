# Vucinich Says Near East Weak Link
## Region 'Full of Contradictions'; Professor Blames East and West 
### DAVID WONG 
"The Near East is a weak link in the democratic system aimed
at containing Communism. It is weak because it is full of contra
dictions. Recent developments have pointed out this weakness,"
said Dr. Wayne S. Vucinich, associate professor of history, in an
interview yesterday.
A specialist in Near Eastern history, Dr. Vucinich said the weak-

ness is to a large extent caused by
♦ lie absence of any political com
munity of interests between West
ern democracies an't llie despotic
pnd feudal regimes in the Near
Eastern countries.
Dr. Vueinich blames both the
Western powers and the traditional
ruling classes of the Near Eastern
countries for the present upheavals.
"Western ideas have come to those
countries sooner than they were !
ready for them, making it difficult |
to bridge the gap between the old j
and the new. What is needed are |
not mere trappings of constitutional \
governments, but basic social and i
economic changes, which alone can
provide regional stability," he de
clared.
Islamic Institutions
Islamic institutions must be
adapted to the modern world, a
.solution amply demonstrated by
Turkish Kemalism, he continued.
The Egyptian and Iranian leaders
who are spearheading the drive
against the British do not allow for
change. Their aim is to preserve
the ancient Moslem ways against
Western ideas of modernism and
liberalism.
In the Near Eastern countries, the
bulk of the population consists of
oppressed and exploited peasants
and nomads. They arc deprived of
political representation and live in
an unenviable state. The wealth is
in the hands of the few, and gov
ernment revenues arc used for the
benefit of the upper classes.
Directing Masses
The ruling classes, seeing their
privileged positions challenged by
Western ideas, arc identifying them
selves as defenders of the old order
against the "infidel" ways of the ,
West. In order to preserve the ex
isting social order, they are direct- j
ing the masses — over whom they {
hold strong sway—away from real
ity and into the always popular re- !
ligio-national movements.
On the other hand, Dr. Vucinich I
pointed out the tragedy of the fail
ure of the Western powers to rec- j
ognize the importance of the his
torical forces at work and to re
adjust their interests to the chang
ing situation.
"The Western powers never took j
into account the forces of national- i
ism and the political aspirations of

the Near Eastern peoples. The Brit
ish made a series of political con
cessions between the two World
Wars in Iraq, Palestine, and Egypt,
and the French did the same in
Syria. But never once were these
made voluntarily from democratic
conviction. They were always made
under compulsion," Dr. Vucinich
said.
In the hope of benefiting from the
present cold war between East and
West, the Near Eastern countries
are pressing their national demands.
Dr. Vucinich thinks the time is ill
chosen, for it only serves to dis
credit the democratic front, and
thereby enhance the forces of Com
munism which, after all, represent
the immediate danger in the Near
East.
Exploitation
In the case of Iran, the real source
of evil is not so much the exploita
tion of oil by the British as the ex
ploitation of Iranians by Iranians.
In the face of a decadent and re
tarded socio - economic system,
Communism remains a real menace.
As for the nationalization of the

Abadan refinery, Dr. Vucinich said
the Iranians undoubtedly have that
right, and that the British are guilty
of not having found a mutually ac
ceptable compromise before the
Iranians took such a drastic step.

However, in view of the present
world situation, the whole question
must be viewed from the standpoint
of military necessity and "realpoli
tik." The immediate results of the
nationalization arc disastrous for
the Iranians since they cannot oper
ate the refinery, and disastrous for
the British because their imperial
position is weakened together with
their contributions to the anti-
Communist front.
The ultimate goal should be the
complete ownership and manage
ment of the refinery by the Iranians,
but for now, Dr. Vucinich believes
the British should be allowed to
run the concern under the general
authority of Iran.

The same military considerations 1
hold true in regard to the Suez Ca- j
nal. While all waterways such as i
Suez, the Straits, and Panama

should eventually be internation- I
alized, he said Egyptian control at ;
the present moment is not sufficient |
to safeguard the vital waterway.
