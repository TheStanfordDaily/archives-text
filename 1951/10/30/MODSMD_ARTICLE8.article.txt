# Quartetto Italiano Reaches High Artistry, Balance
## 
### RONALD ROSEN 
Under the auspices of the Committee on Public Exercises, the
Quartetto Italiano presented a program which reached an artistic
degree seldom encountered in string quartets.
This distinguished group of artists, Paolo Borciani, Elisa Pe
greffi, Piero Farulli, and Franco Rossi, displayed a marvelous

sense of balance, phrasing, and tone
color throughout the program.
The Quartet in D Major by Boe- !
cherini was given a broad and finely
proportioned reading. The subtle I
shading an nuance elicited by the ]
group in the first movement clearly
established the fact that four master
musicians were in command of their ;
respective instruments. The pro
found modulatory progressions of ;
the Adagio and the carefrec pas
sages of the Minuet were performed i
with a maximum of precision, shad- I
ing, and perfect balance.
The seldom-heard Quartet in E
Minor by Verdi offered a pleasant ,
abundance of melody to an en- j
thralled audience. The performance, i
impeccable in style throughout, was j
effortlessly delineated. The andan
tino was allowed to flow smoothly
and the lines were never driven or
forced. Franco Rossi's beautiful |
'cello playing highlighted the trio i
section of the third movement.. The
infinite care that this quartet must
take in its practice sections was evi
dent in the very difficult fitgal pa -
sages of the concluding movement
of this work.
The hauntingly beautiful Qunr
tettsatz in C Minor by Schubert
continued the high standards of this
chamber music concert. The rather
free sonata form offered a vehicle
for wide display of shading, dynam
ics, and balance. These demands
were met admirably by the quartet.
The characteristic Schubertian mel
odies were tossed off in fine, co
herent style and precision.
Debussy's Quartet in G Minor
with its open fourths and whole
tone scale was given a superb lead
ing. The tricky cake-walk rhythm
of the second movement offers many

difficulties, hut in this reading the
quartet was precision personified.
The lovely muted tones of the third
and fourth movements brought this
memorable rendition to a close.
The most disappointing feature of
the concert was the small turnout
at Cubberley Auditorium. Although
many people don't care to listen to
chamber music, they should at least
give themselves a chance to culti
vate this wonderful art. Last night's
concert would have been a marvel
ous introduction to chamber music
for those who missed it. Such pro
grams should not be missed.
