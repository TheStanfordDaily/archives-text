# Drives Com Consolidates Charity Work
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Stanford received another
bow of National recognition last
week, when the American Can
cer Society informed the Farm
that its ASSU Drives Committee
would be the subject of an ar
ticle in its national cancer bulle
tin.
Mrs. Frances B. Harris, the can
cer organization's Palo Alto rep
resentative, told Elinor Yancey,
Drives Committee member ami
chairman of the current all-campus
charity drive, that the Farm group
was the first of its kind at any col
lege in the West. "I wish more
schools did this," she commented.
But what is all the excitement
about? What is this group that au
thorities on charity drives consider
so unique? Mow did it get started?
Stanford's Drives Committee
was horn mil of failure, the fail
ure of last year's all-campus char
ity campaigns to live up to ex
pectations. The 1 fall drive, for
example, fell $2,.'154 short of a
$4,500 goal.
To find out what the trouble was,
F.xcom last spring appointed a Be
lief Drive Committee. On May 0,
1951, they submitted their report,
recommending thai a Drives Com
mittee be set up to:
1. Recommend which charities
should benefit from each quarter's
drive "after setting up standards the
charities must meet, taking into
consideration their relative needs
and student interest in them."
2. Recommend how the drive
proceeds should be disbursed.
.1. Suggest to the chairman ef
fective soliciting techniques, spe
cial events, publicity, and utiliza
tion of new ideas.
1. Recommend the drive chair
man to Fx com.
5. Do research in 'original, ef
fective, and creative drive tech
niques through correspondence and

contact-'*" with such pertinent
as other schools and char
ity organizations.
f>. "lie responsible for year
round campus education to cre
ate a positive attitude toward (jiv
ing among students."
7. "Maintain a file in the ASSU
office ot reports on past drives, in
formation on drive techniques, and
general background on the com
mittee's work.
Drives Com swung into action j
this fall with the following mem- j
hers, representing:
Elinor Yancey, Cardinals, chair- 1
man of the current drive; Pat Ter
ry, IIR; Jackie Harris, YWCA; Ma
rianne Buttner, ASSU Excom; Ma
rilyn MacFarland, girl -at - large;
Mary Bamberg, Public Relations
Committee; Jim Price, boy-at-largc.
Though the group will hence
forth he responsible for actually
conducting the charity campaigns,
its organization late last spring
prompted Excom to place the ac- '

tual responsibility for the present
drive on Cardinals.
Miss Yancey, as Cardinals repre
sentative on the committee, is
chairmanning the drive with the
Drives group aiding her in an ad
visory capacity. Drives Com, for
example, investigated the Palo Alto
Community Chest and the Ameri
can Cancer Society, recipients of
this quarter's drive, and set. up the I
<>0-40 ratio
It was their investigation of the
canccr group earlier this quarter
that prompted the society's prom-

ised writcup in their national
bulletin. The committee invited
Mrs. Harris to speak on the so
ciety and afterward put her to an
hour-long quizzing.
It is thanks to Drives Com that
this fall's drive features only living
group soliciting and a horror movie
Friday night instead of the many
small events of pa; I years. "We
thought cutting down the events
would be better," Miss Yancey ex
plained. "We're trying a new way
of conducting the drives this year,
and we hope it works."

This i,~ our learning quarter,
Harris pointed out, comment
inc* on the committee's part in thT
quarter's drive, which began Mon
day and ends Fridav.

its organization late last spring
prompted Excom to place the ac- '

tual responsibility for the present
drive on Cardinals.
Miss Yancey, as Cardinals repre
sentative on the committee, is
chairmanning the drive with the
Drives group aiding her in an ad
visory capacity. Drives Com, for
example, investigated the Palo Alto
Community Chest and the Ameri
can Cancer Society, recipients of
this quarter's drive, and set. up the I
<>0-40 ratio
It was their investigation of the
canccr group earlier this quarter
that prompted the society's prom-

ised writcup in their national
bulletin. The committee invited
Mrs. Harris to speak on the so
ciety and afterward put her to an
hour-long quizzing.
It is thanks to Drives Com that
this fall's drive features only living
group soliciting and a horror movie
Friday night instead of the many
small events of pa; I years. "We
thought cutting down the events
would be better," Miss Yancey ex
plained. "We're trying a new way
of conducting the drives this year,
and we hope it works."

This i,~ our learning quarter,
Harris pointed out, comment
inc* on the committee's part in thT
quarter's drive, which began Mon
day and ends Fridav.
