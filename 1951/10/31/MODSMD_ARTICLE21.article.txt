### PETE GROTHE 
WEDNESDAY MORNING QUICKIES
The morning alter the Washington game, a Seattle
paper reported the woes of a Stanford tuba player.
Jt si'tms that the guy who goes oom-pah-pah got
tuck in the tunnel on the way out of the stadium and
had to be separated from the tuba by means of a blow
torch. At least, so says the Seattle paper.
MICHIGAN POSTSCRIPT. While the football team
was in Michigan, they bunked down in the plush
Dearborn Inn The manager was short of rooms, how-

ever, so guards Leon King and
Jesse Cone were shown to the
bridal .suite. That night, 440
pounds of football beef snoozed
on an air-foam double bed with
a canopy on the top and frilly lace
on the sides.
IDENTIFICATION DEPT. For
the many persons who have asked
me who the kids were in last
week's scrambled double - date
episode, they are Mary Massey

(Martha), Jill Bingham (Jane), Jim Madison (John),
and Brad Jeffries (Bill).
'AND THE MARGINAL REVENUE CURVE . .
The collegiate counterpart of giving an apple to the
teacher is helping the econ professor remove a bother
some chart from the blackboard. Or at least, that's
what one of the students in Professor Henderson's
econ class thought.
Mr. Henderson was trying to extend the marginal
revenue curve on the board, but couldn't because a
chart was in the way. He tried to remove the chart.

couldn't, went on with the lecture. Rut this wasn't
the v iul of the episode. One of the students thought
that by all means Mr. Henderson's marginal revenue
curve must he extended, and so he (tick it upon him
self to remove the obstacle.
The chart was somewhat out of reach, though, so
he had to leap to get it. A leaping figure in the front
of the classroom was rather disconcerting to the lec
turer who was trying to explain the various aspects
of the marginal revenue curve but rather enjoyable to
the 280 students who much preferred watching a class
room acrobat. The student, who must be given credit
for lending a helping hand, got a chair in order to
better bring the chart down from its haunches.
As he got ahold of one of the ends, the chair slipped,
he forgot to let go, and a sizable rip was the result.
Five minutes later, when all the guffaws had been
muffled, Professor Henderson's marginal revenue
curve was extended.
NEW SONG DEPT. We turn over the rest of the
column to KZSU's Tex Thompson. Tex, who plays a
mean guitar, has written new words to "Too Young,"
called "They Tried To Sell Us Egg Foo Young."
Ready, hit it!
They tried to sell us egg foo young,
Foo young instead of good boiled tongue
They said the egg was shirred
And just laid by a bird
A bird who's never heard of egg foo young
And yet they led us far astray
That bird was not so far away
And when that hen her egg recalled
We had no foo young at all.
