## Egypt and the British Commonwealth 
### 
To the Editor:
Just before the weekend seven very fearsome for
eign students wrote you a rather sharp note on several
delicate subjects. Egypt figured among most of them,
112 ireat Britain was rudely referred to in some of them.
American people were admonished in the last of them.
Now this is all most regrettable. Breakfast can be
completely spoiled by reading of beefy Britishers get
tiny up in 193G and brow-beating Egyptians into com
ing to agreements. If the Egyptians foresaw World
War II in that year—as their letter says—they might
at least have passed the word to the Western Powers,
be cause these powers were awfully short of guns when
the war did break out.
"All the British want is economical exploitation
of Egypt" (sic). Well it is true that they provided
Egypt with most of her funds for public works ex
penditures and carried oft' home the bad bonds for
the greater part of an Egyptian National Debt of
8245.000,000...
The Suez Canal has been operated for the benefit
of all shipping including the British. Why should it
now be taken over by Egypt? "Going back not more
than two hundred years"—why shouldn't the Turks
claim Suez and Egypt too? Why shouldn't Spain re
claim the Philippines?
Let s face it. Peace and quiet among nations rests
on their recognizing each other's rights, and that
includes existing property rights. This may or ma>
not lie morally justified. The point is: international
law deals with what is now.
If every nation starts turning needlessly nationalistic
exeunt attempts at international understanding, and
• titer anarchy. That might give us all lots of freedom,
but I would rather feel that the British Commonwealth
was not free to move in on the Principality of Monte
Carlo, nor was the Principality free to lay a claim to
the British Commonwealth.
But let me cease. Political porridge is bad for any
body's breakfast.
