# More on Egypt
## 
### 
To the Editor:
112 do not wish to defend the principle of one power
garrisoning the territory ol another against the will
of the latter, but your Egyptian correspondents are
guilty of such misrepresentation that this letter cannot
bo allowed to pass unanswered.
In the first place your correspondents allege that the

treaties of 1899 and 193G were extorted (sic) from the
Egyptians with guns in their backs. Three points
should be noted:
Firstly it was British generalship and British capital
which in 1898 rescued the Sudan from anarchy after
# the incompetent and corrupt Egyptian administration
had lost control some seventeen years earlier. Britain
is now preparing the Sudan for independence not sub
jugation to Egypt.
Secondly the treaty of 193G was welcomed by Egypt
and not least by that Prime Minister who now abro
gates it. In 193G Italy had attacked Abyssinia and
Egypt feeling herself threatened from Libyce wanted
a British alliance.
Thirdly to say that the treaty of 193G was signed with
the outbreak of the second world war in sight is to
display a singular wisdomâ€”after the event.
