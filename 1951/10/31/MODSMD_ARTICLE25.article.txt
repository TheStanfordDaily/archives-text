# The
						Language Requirement
## 
### 
To the Editor:
We would like to add our collective voice to the
fervent chorus of "change the language requirement!"
Specifically, we firmly believe that the requirement
should be three quarters in length designed to he of
the greatest profit to the student, and to this end we
recommend an extensive use of films, records, .-mcl
directed conversations to foster a speaking knowledge
of a language. Thus grammar would be painlessly
assimilated in the process and the hangover which
follows the existing language requirement would be
greatly reduced.
So be it!!!!
