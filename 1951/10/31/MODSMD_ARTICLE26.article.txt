# PROFESSOR BUSS REPORTS
## Japan Enjoys Good Living 
### 
'Die Japanese are enjoying a pret
ty fcood present even if the future
does seem dark.
Ibis was the report from Dr.
( laude Buss, Stanford professor
of history and former U.S. diplo
mat. who is currently in the Far
hast under a Rockefeller Founda
tion travel grant.
In a letter to a colleague at Stan
ford, Dr. Buss gave the following
picture, of conditions in Japan to
day.
The bright side:
"The food is good, the saki is
plentiful, and the cost of living has
not gone high enough to wreck
completely the family budget as
yet. The stores in Tokyo are well
locked, the people are compara
tively well dressed, and above all
the spirit of pep and confidence has
returned.
"Last year they christened a new
candy store The New Japan Candy
Store"; this year they named a new
laundry 'The New Asia Laundry.'
"Their horizons are expanding.
They are not afraid of Russia or
of Communists. I doubt very
much if the end of the occupa
tion is going to result in any anti-
American outbursts. They look
upon us and our power realisti

cally and know very well that our
support and understanding are
needed to help them along their
road to recovery."
Here were his remarks on the
sober side of things:
"Living standards are low: the
population goes up and up while
food resources remain constant. Ja
j pan has alien soldiers on her soil.
: which hurts her pride but really is
her only guarantee of security. 'Ihe
future looks drab.
"What is going to happen when
jobs are scarcer, when our Army
stops buying supplies for Korea, and
when the other countries in the
' world start putting high tariffs on
Japanese goods again?
"Imagine, the Japanese are al
ready exporting between 40.(100
and 50.000 sewing machines each
month and at about $20 each.
Mow much do sewing machines
cost iii Palo Alto anywav?"
Dr. Buss gave the following de
scription of his meeting with Prime
Minister Yonhida of Japan.
"While we were doing what we
did to Michigan, I was trying to
keep my mind off football long
enough to discuss the future of Ja-
P'iri with my distinguished ho; t in
his villa at the loot of Mt Fuji. My

host was the Prime Minister a de
lightful old gentleman who is in
finitely more mellow and humor
ous than he appears to be on tele
vision screens at home,
"\Tr. Yoshida was agreeably
surprised at San Francisco. He
tells the story that when he was a
young man. the government sent
him to China; immediately Chi
nese-Japanese relations got worse:
then he went to the United States
and Americans thought less and
less of Japanese; next he was
transferred to England and even
the ISiitish tinned anti-Japanese.
Finally he went to San Francisco,
hut he came hack with a sense of
gratification at the reception he
received.
"He has good rea on for his grati
fication. Japan might have don<
much worse at San Francisco. In
deed. it might have done rnucl
worse during the whole occupation
Compared to Korea, for example
Japan is a paradise?. Just ask
soldier who is lucky enough to drav
a few flavs' rest and relaxation,
think they call it. From Korea t<
Japan."

( laude Buss, Stanford professor
of history and former U.S. diplo
mat. who is currently in the Far
hast under a Rockefeller Founda
tion travel grant.
In a letter to a colleague at Stan
ford, Dr. Buss gave the following
picture, of conditions in Japan to
day.
The bright side:
"The food is good, the saki is
plentiful, and the cost of living has
not gone high enough to wreck
completely the family budget as
yet. The stores in Tokyo are well
locked, the people are compara
tively well dressed, and above all
the spirit of pep and confidence has
returned.
"Last year they christened a new
candy store The New Japan Candy
Store"; this year they named a new
laundry 'The New Asia Laundry.'
"Their horizons are expanding.
They are not afraid of Russia or
of Communists. I doubt very
much if the end of the occupa
tion is going to result in any anti-
American outbursts. They look
upon us and our power realisti

cally and know very well that our
support and understanding are
needed to help them along their
road to recovery."
Here were his remarks on the
sober side of things:
"Living standards are low: the
population goes up and up while
food resources remain constant. Ja
j pan has alien soldiers on her soil.
: which hurts her pride but really is
her only guarantee of security. 'Ihe
future looks drab.
"What is going to happen when
jobs are scarcer, when our Army
stops buying supplies for Korea, and
when the other countries in the
' world start putting high tariffs on
Japanese goods again?
"Imagine, the Japanese are al
ready exporting between 40.(100
and 50.000 sewing machines each
month and at about $20 each.
Mow much do sewing machines
cost iii Palo Alto anywav?"
Dr. Buss gave the following de
scription of his meeting with Prime
Minister Yonhida of Japan.
"While we were doing what we
did to Michigan, I was trying to
keep my mind off football long
enough to discuss the future of Ja-
P'iri with my distinguished ho; t in
his villa at the loot of Mt Fuji. My

lightful old gentleman who is in

surprised at San Francisco. He
tells the story that when he was a
young man. the government sent
him to China; immediately Chi
nese-Japanese relations got worse:
then he went to the United States
and Americans thought less and
less of Japanese; next he was
transferred to England and even
the ISiitish tinned anti-Japanese.
Finally he went to San Francisco,
hut he came hack with a sense of
gratification at the reception he
received.
"He has good rea on for his grati
fication. Japan might have don<
much worse at San Francisco. In
