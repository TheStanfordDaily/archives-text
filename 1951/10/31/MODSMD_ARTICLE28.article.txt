# 'THE STORM WITHIN'
## Cocteau's Tragi-comedy Depicts Love Triangle 
### DICK FREDELL 
For moviegoers who liked
Jean Cocteau as they found him
in "Orpheus," but would like
something that doesn't make
quite so many frustrating de
mands on the gray matter, "The
Storm Within" at the Guild is
perhaps just the answer.
Though "Storm" is, in its way,
also confusing, Cocteau's purpose,
at least, is readily understandable
this time. Here he investigates the
conflict between two generations as
revealed through a complex love
triangle.
Michel has fallen In love with a
girl of approximately his own age,
to the despair ol his mother, whose

entire life is her
son. In her ob
session, howev
er, she has thor
oughly neglect
ed her husband,
who is driven
by loneliness to

take a mistress. The mistress turns
out to be none other than Michel's
girl. Thus we have father and son
in love with the same woman.
Sub-titles "Lacking"
Cocteau's treatment of this situa
tion is where the confusion comes
in. American audiences, left to
struggle with a sadly lacking set
of sub-titles, will wonder just how
they are to accept this story: as
farce, as melodrama, as comedy, or
as tragedy.
Viewers muv interpret for them-

I selves, but it would seen; that Coc-
I teuu has purposely mixed together
J all of these elements.
The acting, ol course, is top
notch. Cocteau's favorite actor, Jean
Marais, turns in another of his im
petuous performances as Michel,
j and Josette Day and Gabrielle Dor
[ ziat ure as fine as ever.
Photography "Imaginative"
The photography, too, is imagina
tive and interesting. Cocteau ex
hibits his usual remarkable talent
for clever angles, which in itself is
worth studying.
In conclusion, it can be said that
"The Storm Within" is a waste of
neither time nor monev.
