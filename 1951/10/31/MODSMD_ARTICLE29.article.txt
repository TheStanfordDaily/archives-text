"Life Hits SC; Troy Hits Life" j
I was the headline in Monday's Daily j
I Trojan describing student hody re- I
| action to Life's coverage of the '
j USC-Cal game.
Enraged by Life's article (Oct.
2!) issue) in which Pat Caniiamela
was referred to as a "human go
rilla" and the team accused of ;
J "impersonating Murder, Inc.,"
1 John Bradley, SC president, sent
j the following telegram to the i
magazine:
"Your insinuations that SC's vie- >
tory over California w;is achieved
by unnecessary rough tactics is an
insult to a fine group of athletes
j who gained a great upset victory. .
Your story can only be added to j
| other irresponsible charges of "dirty I
! lootball" which have been denied I
I by all competent observers inelud- !
j ing California Coach Lynn Waldorf. !
"Phrases such as 'Murder, Inc.,' !
and a 'human gorilla' (reference to i
Pat Cannamela), and statements
that SC's planned strategy was to
I 'soften them up first and worry
! about winning later,' are unwar
i ranted and unfair."
A campus poll of student opin
ion on the story brought forth
such comments as ". . . Some of
the pictures taken on the train
showed Trojans with whiskey and
beer, but no pictures were ever
shown of (he disgusting way in
which the Cal rooting section be
haved themselves."
". . . Regardless of what Life was
I trying to prove with its article, by
showing Gifford's Gi)-yard run and
J the top-notch blocking that made it !
possible, they certainly gave a boost ;
to the team's prestige."
