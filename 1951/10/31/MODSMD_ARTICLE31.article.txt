## Ho Hum, Another Breather 
### "DIGGER" ODELL 
Thc price of the Rose Bowl tie is going up! We just can't seem to hold
down this surge of inflation when the Indians keep winding up on top of
the heap.
However, the FOR SALE sign is still up because we can't seem to get
the next four games out of our mind. We're probably the only person on
campus who hasn't made reservations for the Pasadena trip. What few
funs we had at the beginning of the season, those who remembered the In
dians' late-seasdn stumblings in '49 and '50 after early-season rompings,
have all gone over to the flag waving side after the 14 to 7 success at Seattle
last weekend.
Last week we heard in our journeys throughout the Farm more than a
few say with conviction that if we got by Washington, we'd go all the way.
Well, (hey got their win, and already many are revising their New Year's
Eve plans. Oh, they'll tell you we've still got USC and C'al to go yet—
completely forgetting Washington State and Oregon State—and they'll
probably agree that these two teams won't be pushovers, hut still they go
blithely ahead with their heads in clouds of roses.
If all this is true, if we're shoo-ins as of now, we'd like to know why the
lootball team is working its head off these days out on the practice field for
a team like Washington State. Why not relax; take it easy. We've got the
Hose Bowl team. Let's sit back and rest, save our team for New Year's Day.
There are a few men standing in the way of this philosophy, though.
Chuck Taylor and his crew don't share this arm-chair quarterback thinking.
Ask Chuck, for instance, what he thinks of the Washington State game this
Saturday. He'll hand you a real laugh. He'll tell you it'll be our toughest
game to date and probably of the whole season. Now isn't that something;
the little old Cougars, a tough one. A team that's lost two games this season
already tough against an undefeated machine.
Oh, Chuck will give you some interesting reasons for his statement.
1 fe'll give you some goulash about the Cougars scoring 35 points against
Super Cal a few weeks ago, losing by only one touchdown. They lost,
though, didn't they? Pie might even say something about the great variety
in their offense.
Chuck will also mention something you may even agree with in an
offhanded fashion. He'll say something about mental attitude on the team,
about how the boys know they've got a tough one coming up, hut after
being so "high" for tho Huskies it will he hard for the team to stay "up."
Taylor will tell you that it's easy for the team to get "high" for the likes
of the Trojans and the Bears, but when it comes to Washington State and
Oregon State—well, it's like gettting high for San Jose State.
Take these Cougars now, the team Grantland Rice once called "eleven
.strawberry pops" in recognition of the all-red uniforms they wore in the
Rose Bowl in 1931 (Oh, yes, they've been to the Rose Bowl twice). Of course,
ihey did beat us 14 to 7 in 1948, but we didn't have anything but spirit that
year. Since then the boys from Eastern Washington just haven't had it.
They aren't in the inner circle. They've been hanging on to the PCC coat
tails as "breathers" for 10, these many years, except for the few periods
when the youngsters got uppity.
We've got news for you, however. The youngsters have grown up.
They're going around picking on big boys now and they probably figure us
as a good place to practice (we're not in the big league yet).
And as for Stanford, who knows what we have. Sure, we've got some
darn good ball players, but do we have a good team—or just a lucky one?
We've managed to squeak through six games seemingly without getting a
real "test." Washington State could provide that "test," silly as it might
sound to you with your Pasadena reservations grasped tightly in your
grubby little fists.
Oh, well, why worry. We're going to the Rose Bowl, so sit back and
relax. We sincerely hope that the Card footballers are deaf, though.

GLORY BE!!—Stanford's All-Coast candidate for guard, Norm Manoo
gian, and as tough a guy as you'd ever want to meet, won a prize the other
a.m. for giving the right answer to a question put forth by a classical
music program on KIBE. In true Stanfordian tradition, culture pours out
from even our football team.
These boys don't take their studies any too lightly either. Coming back
from Seattle on the plane, San Francisco Examiner sports writer Bob Braeh
nian was complaining that it was no fun to travel with the Cards. They did
more studying than partying.

year. Since then the boys from Eastern Washington just haven't had it.
They aren't in the inner circle. They've been hanging on to the PCC coat
tails as "breathers" for 10, these many years, except for the few periods
when the youngsters got uppity.
We've got news for you, however. The youngsters have grown up.
They're going around picking on big boys now and they probably figure us
as a good place to practice (we're not in the big league yet).
And as for Stanford, who knows what we have. Sure, we've got some
darn good ball players, but do we have a good team—or just a lucky one?
We've managed to squeak through six games seemingly without getting a
real "test." Washington State could provide that "test," silly as it might
sound to you with your Pasadena reservations grasped tightly in your
grubby little fists.
Oh, well, why worry. We're going to the Rose Bowl, so sit back and
relax. We sincerely hope that the Card footballers are deaf, though.

GLORY BE!!—Stanford's All-Coast candidate for guard, Norm Manoo
gian, and as tough a guy as you'd ever want to meet, won a prize the other
a.m. for giving the right answer to a question put forth by a classical
music program on KIBE. In true Stanfordian tradition, culture pours out
from even our football team.
These boys don't take their studies any too lightly either. Coming back
from Seattle on the plane, San Francisco Examiner sports writer Bob Braeh
nian was complaining that it was no fun to travel with the Cards. They did
more studying than partying.
Thc price of the Rose Bowl tie is going up! We just can't seem to hold
down this surge of inflation when the Indians keep winding up on top of
the heap.
However, the FOR SALE sign is still up because we can't seem to get
the next four games out of our mind. We're probably the only person on
campus who hasn't made reservations for the Pasadena trip. What few
funs we had at the beginning of the season, those who remembered the In
dians' late-seasdn stumblings in '49 and '50 after early-season rompings,
have all gone over to the flag waving side after the 14 to 7 success at Seattle
last weekend.
Last week we heard in our journeys throughout the Farm more than a
few say with conviction that if we got by Washington, we'd go all the way.
Well, (hey got their win, and already many are revising their New Year's
Eve plans. Oh, they'll tell you we've still got USC and C'al to go yet—
completely forgetting Washington State and Oregon State—and they'll
probably agree that these two teams won't be pushovers, hut still they go
blithely ahead with their heads in clouds of roses.
If all this is true, if we're shoo-ins as of now, we'd like to know why the
lootball team is working its head off these days out on the practice field for
a team like Washington State. Why not relax; take it easy. We've got the
Hose Bowl team. Let's sit back and rest, save our team for New Year's Day.
There are a few men standing in the way of this philosophy, though.
Chuck Taylor and his crew don't share this arm-chair quarterback thinking.
Ask Chuck, for instance, what he thinks of the Washington State game this
Saturday. He'll hand you a real laugh. He'll tell you it'll be our toughest
game to date and probably of the whole season. Now isn't that something;
the little old Cougars, a tough one. A team that's lost two games this season
already tough against an undefeated machine.
Oh, Chuck will give you some interesting reasons for his statement.
1 fe'll give you some goulash about the Cougars scoring 35 points against
Super Cal a few weeks ago, losing by only one touchdown. They lost,
though, didn't they? Pie might even say something about the great variety
in their offense.
Chuck will also mention something you may even agree with in an
offhanded fashion. He'll say something about mental attitude on the team,
about how the boys know they've got a tough one coming up, hut after
being so "high" for tho Huskies it will he hard for the team to stay "up."
Taylor will tell you that it's easy for the team to get "high" for the likes
of the Trojans and the Bears, but when it comes to Washington State and
Oregon State—well, it's like gettting high for San Jose State.
Take these Cougars now, the team Grantland Rice once called "eleven
.strawberry pops" in recognition of the all-red uniforms they wore in the
Rose Bowl in 1931 (Oh, yes, they've been to the Rose Bowl twice). Of course,
ihey did beat us 14 to 7 in 1948, but we didn't have anything but spirit that

Hose Bowl team. Let's sit back and rest, save our team for New Year's Day.
There are a few men standing in the way of this philosophy, though.
Chuck Taylor and his crew don't share this arm-chair quarterback thinking.
Ask Chuck, for instance, what he thinks of the Washington State game this
Saturday. He'll hand you a real laugh. He'll tell you it'll be our toughest
game to date and probably of the whole season. Now isn't that something;
the little old Cougars, a tough one. A team that's lost two games this season
already tough against an undefeated machine.
Oh, Chuck will give you some interesting reasons for his statement.
1 fe'll give you some goulash about the Cougars scoring 35 points against
Super Cal a few weeks ago, losing by only one touchdown. They lost,
though, didn't they? Pie might even say something about the great variety
in their offense.
Chuck will also mention something you may even agree with in an
offhanded fashion. He'll say something about mental attitude on the team,
about how the boys know they've got a tough one coming up, hut after
being so "high" for tho Huskies it will he hard for the team to stay "up."
Taylor will tell you that it's easy for the team to get "high" for the likes
of the Trojans and the Bears, but when it comes to Washington State and
Oregon State—well, it's like gettting high for San Jose State.
Take these Cougars now, the team Grantland Rice once called "eleven
.strawberry pops" in recognition of the all-red uniforms they wore in the
Rose Bowl in 1931 (Oh, yes, they've been to the Rose Bowl twice). Of course,
ihey did beat us 14 to 7 in 1948, but we didn't have anything but spirit that
year. Since then the boys from Eastern Washington just haven't had it.
They aren't in the inner circle. They've been hanging on to the PCC coat
tails as "breathers" for 10, these many years, except for the few periods
when the youngsters got uppity.
We've got news for you, however. The youngsters have grown up.
They're going around picking on big boys now and they probably figure us
as a good place to practice (we're not in the big league yet).
And as for Stanford, who knows what we have. Sure, we've got some
darn good ball players, but do we have a good team—or just a lucky one?
We've managed to squeak through six games seemingly without getting a
real "test." Washington State could provide that "test," silly as it might
sound to you with your Pasadena reservations grasped tightly in your
grubby little fists.
Oh, well, why worry. We're going to the Rose Bowl, so sit back and
relax. We sincerely hope that the Card footballers are deaf, though.

GLORY BE!!—Stanford's All-Coast candidate for guard, Norm Manoo
gian, and as tough a guy as you'd ever want to meet, won a prize the other
a.m. for giving the right answer to a question put forth by a classical
music program on KIBE. In true Stanfordian tradition, culture pours out
from even our football team.
These boys don't take their studies any too lightly either. Coming back
from Seattle on the plane, San Francisco Examiner sports writer Bob Braeh
nian was complaining that it was no fun to travel with the Cards. They did
more studying than partying.
Thc price of the Rose Bowl tie is going up! We just can't seem to hold
down this surge of inflation when the Indians keep winding up on top of
the heap.
However, the FOR SALE sign is still up because we can't seem to get
the next four games out of our mind. We're probably the only person on
campus who hasn't made reservations for the Pasadena trip. What few
funs we had at the beginning of the season, those who remembered the In
dians' late-seasdn stumblings in '49 and '50 after early-season rompings,
have all gone over to the flag waving side after the 14 to 7 success at Seattle
last weekend.
Last week we heard in our journeys throughout the Farm more than a
few say with conviction that if we got by Washington, we'd go all the way.
Well, (hey got their win, and already many are revising their New Year's
Eve plans. Oh, they'll tell you we've still got USC and C'al to go yet—
completely forgetting Washington State and Oregon State—and they'll
probably agree that these two teams won't be pushovers, hut still they go
blithely ahead with their heads in clouds of roses.
If all this is true, if we're shoo-ins as of now, we'd like to know why the
lootball team is working its head off these days out on the practice field for
a team like Washington State. Why not relax; take it easy. We've got the
Hose Bowl team. Let's sit back and rest, save our team for New Year's Day.
