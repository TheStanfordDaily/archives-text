' Men of UCLA arise!!! Demand
an all-male rooting section so we
can raise HELL!"
Dissatisfied with their own mixed
rooting section and struck by the
'noise" made by Stanford rooters
at the Stanford-UCLA game two
weeks ago, two UCLA seniors
voiced the above desire to raise
"HELL" in a letter to the editor
of the Daily Bruin last week.
Making a "few comments con
cerning observations made on the
Stanford trip," the UCLA seniors
pointed out that "Stanford's all
male rooting section made more
'noise' than we could ever hope to
get with a mixed section." The
"conclusion," as worded above, was
for the men of UCLA to "arise!"
In addition to the noise made by
the Farm rooters, the UCLA-ans
were impressed by the Stanford
women who "went to the game in
red skirts, white blouses, and red
feathers in their hair. They looked
great."
So impressed were the Southland
seniors that they concluded, "Since
UCLA women cannot be expected
to wear rod and a feather, they
can at least go to the game with a
little BEAR showing."
