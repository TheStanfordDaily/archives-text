There are only t.'i more shop- |

With that fact in mind, the
Stanford Bookstore is currently j
featuring a window display on
Christmas cards and gifts. The |
store is now stocked with nu- \
mcrous gift items and Christmas 1
cards.
In the other window, a display
is now being made of the recent
University Press publication, "45 !
Contemporary Mexican Artists."
The hook, by Virginia Stewart,
includes sketches and color work
by the artists from south of the |
border.
On Nov. ti. Elizabeth Bowen,
professor and authoress, will be j
on campus to speak, and at that
time she will visit at the Book- |
store. Several of her books are |
on sale in the general book de
partment of the store.
