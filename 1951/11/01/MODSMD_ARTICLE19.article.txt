Society.
Last night, after three days of
colloctions, the campaign had net
tod $735. Living group soliciting

Tho drivo represents a tie-in be
tween Stanford, Iho surrounding
community, and the nation, Miss
Hansen pointed out. Somo of the
money actually comes back to aid
the Farm through the Community
Chest contribution to the campus
"Y and Cancer Socioty resoarch
grants to the Stanford Research In
stitute.
Rut giving to the drive has sig
nificance beyond what returns to

The ivory tower tendency is a
problem most universities have to
contend with, and this is one op

lected this year, Drive Chairman
