# Ready Big Assault
## 
### 
TOKYO â€” United Nations forces
readied a new "persuader offensive"
today to throw against the Commu
nists in Korea if such an offensive
is necessary to speed up the armi
stice negotiations.
Details of the Allied plans were
not disclosed, but the UN troops
were poised for immediate action if
the Communists should become
overly stubborn in the armistice
talks at Panmunjom.
No major fighting occurred today
as UN troops strengthened their po
sitions and prepared for the coming
assault.
