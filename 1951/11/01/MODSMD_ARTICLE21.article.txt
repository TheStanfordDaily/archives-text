# Village Council Entertains 300 Kids
## 
### DICK SCHWARZ 
Stanford Village was invaded
yesterday afternoon by witches
and ghosts, when over 300 Vil
lage children in original and
bright costumes entered the Vil
laqe auditorium.
"Hie Village Family Council had
done a great job preparing this an
nual Halloween party, and the audi
torium was transformed into a color
fully decorated theater. The Village
cub scout den had worked many days
on this decorating job, and it was a
great success.
While hundreds of bright children
eyes looked in expectation at the
stage, many ghosts and witches tried
to scare their little friends, who filled
the auditorium with scared and sur
prised screams.
John Yai borough. Head of the Stu
dent Personnel Services, emceed the
party and led the children one hv on?
onto the stage, so that everybody
could enjoy their costumes. It was
a great moment for each of the kids
to be all alone there on the big, big
stage.
Of course they were all anxious to
know who would win the prizes for
the hc.st_ costumes, but this climax
was reserved for the end of the party.
Many parents were present, proud of
their children and the costumes they
had made for them.
After everybody was seated, Mrs.
Ruth Ann Sayler presented her pro
fessional dance group, made up from
children between 5 and 10. Little girls
danced, sang and tap-danced as real
professional performers, and the
auditorium applauded enthusiastic
ally after each number.
This is the second consecutive year
that Mrs. Sayler staged her perform
ance (without pay), and she did a

great job entertaining the kids.
We saw a little girl si tie; and tap
dance; then a group of R lovely little
children danced to recorded music.
The young audience looked with big
eyes at-an acrobatic dancer who per
formed the most difficult handstands
and somersaults with amazing ease.
After the performance ended. Yar
bo rough introduced Mis. Harvey

Hall, chairman of the judging com
mittee. who announced the prize
I winners.
And there they came, all in their
costumes. Parents helped them on
the stage and many an eager little
hand was lost in the big one of Yar
borough, while Mrs. Harvey-Hall
presented the prizes.
| Refreshments and cookies with the

face of a ghost on them were served,
as the children took ofT their masks.
The prizewinners stayed for a
while on the stage to have their pic
ture taken. One of them, a little boy,
was so tired at the end of the after
noon. that lie fell asleep on the stage
and still looked with sleepy eyes at
the camera, when the picture was
finally taken.

the auditorium with scared and sur
prised screams.
John Yai borough. Head of the Stu
dent Personnel Services, emceed the
party and led the children one hv on?
onto the stage, so that everybody
could enjoy their costumes. It was
a great moment for each of the kids
to be all alone there on the big, big
stage.
Of course they were all anxious to
know who would win the prizes for
the hc.st_ costumes, but this climax
was reserved for the end of the party.
Many parents were present, proud of
their children and the costumes they
had made for them.
After everybody was seated, Mrs.
Ruth Ann Sayler presented her pro
fessional dance group, made up from
children between 5 and 10. Little girls
danced, sang and tap-danced as real
professional performers, and the
auditorium applauded enthusiastic
ally after each number.
This is the second consecutive year
that Mrs. Sayler staged her perform
ance (without pay), and she did a

great job entertaining the kids.
We saw a little girl si tie; and tap
dance; then a group of R lovely little
children danced to recorded music.
The young audience looked with big
eyes at-an acrobatic dancer who per
formed the most difficult handstands
and somersaults with amazing ease.
After the performance ended. Yar
bo rough introduced Mis. Harvey

Hall, chairman of the judging com
mittee. who announced the prize
I winners.
And there they came, all in their
costumes. Parents helped them on
the stage and many an eager little
hand was lost in the big one of Yar
borough, while Mrs. Harvey-Hall
presented the prizes.
| Refreshments and cookies with the

face of a ghost on them were served,
as the children took ofT their masks.
The prizewinners stayed for a
while on the stage to have their pic
ture taken. One of them, a little boy,
was so tired at the end of the after
noon. that lie fell asleep on the stage
and still looked with sleepy eyes at
the camera, when the picture was
finally taken.
