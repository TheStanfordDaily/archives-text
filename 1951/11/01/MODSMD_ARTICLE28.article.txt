# Those Washboard Stanford Roads
## 
### 
Like o lot of other things, Stanford's roads
could stand repair. Granted. The jostlings re
ceived when your car dips into a rut or shim
mies on "corduroyed" pavement aren't pleas
ant.
But like a lot of other things, repairs on roads
will probably have to wait. They require
money.
What apparently isn't always realized by
noine students is that Stanford is primarily an
educational institution, and University funds
are first channeled, whenever possible, into ed
ucational facilities. Road building is an expen
sive proposition. The results of even the most
careful and extensive planning can sometimes
result in partial failure as the Galvez Street
repairs along the side of Encina illustrate.
Outside engineers as well as Stanford men
were consulted in planning toward making this
a permanent road. After studying Stanford's
peculiar soil composition, underground mois
ture, etc., they made plans for six inches of
concrete base on the road. University officials
requested an additional two "just in case."
The road had the benefit of careful scientific
planning, expensive and thorough construction
and yet it was not entirely successful. Ruts de
veloped within a few months, which had to be
smoothed and refilled. That's the way read con
struction, an infant science, is.

When Stanford was founded before the turn
of the century there could be no planning foi
automobiles. Stanford's roads were horse and
buggy roads. As the bicycle came into widei
use, a layer of gravel was placed on roads
surfaces so that bike tires wouldn't mire down
in winter mud.
Then when autos came into general use a
layer of black oil was poured on top. This
proved unsatisfactory. It took many years of
experimenting before a good method of build
ing substantial roads were developed. So roads
on the Farm grew up haphazardly—haphazard
ly because there was no way lo foresee certain
transportational evolutions.
As a result, the University must v/ork "on
top" of decades of "failure." And it's no easy
job.
Added to this is the fact that autos on campus
have multiplied enormously over the years.
There are now more cars than there once were
students. The same roads are battered by stu
dents' cars many times daily — to and from
class; out at night and home again. Wear and
tear is constant.
So we'll have to just sit tight for awhile
on road repairs. But most of us would rather
have first rate instructors, lab facilities, and
some of the rest of Stanford's "first rates," than
a letter-perfect roadway system.—J.M.
