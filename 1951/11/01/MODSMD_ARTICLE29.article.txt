### DICK McLEAN 
PERSPECTIVE
Are you .sleepy right now? Do your eyes feel like
lead bitll bearings lubricated with sand? If you looked
in a mirror, would the whites resemble a detailed road
map of Los Angeles County? Does the coffee taste like
acid to your sleepy tongue? If any of the above are
true, finish reading this and go back to bed. Yes. kiss
off the idea of class this morning. Believe me, it's the

best thing.
You say you crammed last night?
You had to do it to get a good
grade? So what! How much of it
are you going to remember a week
from now, a month? How much
did you actually learn by the late
study? (A good question at this
point is what is the correlation be
tween learning and grades any
how? )
Don't get me wrong. I think
education is fine. But college

should he fun too. Nothing is sadder than the poor
fellow who opens the door of the class and stumbles
in blindly on the day of the test.
At first you don't recognize him. His eyes are like
goli balls sagging in a hammock o! pouchy flesh. As
he rubs his bewhiskered chin, you notice that his
fingers quiver with each heartbeat. He is mumbling
and singing little songs to himself. When he recognizes
you, he babbles, "Boy, am I going to kill this exam.
I really studied."
Then ho proceeds to miss the blue book completely
and write the whole test on the desk top. But this
man of purpose is not to bo dissuaded. He rips the
wooden top off and turns it in. The reader for the class,
as most readers, is a person of consummate imagina
tion and humor and gives our hero an "A" for origin
ality.
The poor kid gets just about as far as Engineering
Corner before he caves in. The University sends home
his grades (all "A") with the standard form letter:
Dear Parent:
We shipped your son, . to the sani

(ariuin you designated. We are certainly sorry that
he decided to drop out for the quarter.
He shows marked ability as a student and we hope
he will return when he feels a little better.
Sincerely,
Dr. Summors
Psychiatrist
P.S. Will you kindly forward $12.28 for one wooden
desk top which had to be replaced.
There is another sad pattern in this "I'll-be-a-Phi-
Beta-Kappa-or-bust" psychology. It usually happens
to girls.
She was a pretty girl to start with. Big eyes and a
nice smile. When she sauntered down Quad, the men
looked at her and then tried to find out her name.
Her telephone buzzer rang incessantly. Oh, she went
out for a few weeks and then "tired" of the social
aspects of college. Her daddy had gotten a Phi Beta
Kappa key and she thought it would be nice to make
an ear ring set out of two of them. She decided to go
straight "A."
The telephone buzzer still buzzed and then men still
stared. But our heroine always answered, "No, I'm
sorry. I've got to study tonight. Thank you for call
ing." And then like a dying hope the calls grew fewer
and fewer. The men looked less and no longer asked.
One day she awoke from her delusion. The image
of the black and gold key no longer carried her
through the hard hours of books and dead libraries.
She waited for the calls to come. <She hadn't noticed
that they'd stopped.) She waited and waited. Only
her mirror told the truth. The pretty eyes had been
squinted of all their beauty. The smile, long un
used, was gone. Life in its vital, throbbing course
had passed her by.
When she returned to her book and tried to study,
she found it rather hard, for the tears obscured her
vision.
So heed the above lesson and take my advice. Finish
the coffee, lay the paper down, go back to your room,
climb back in your pajamas, crawl back into bed,
pull the cool sheets up to your chin, and close your
eyes. The rest is easy.
