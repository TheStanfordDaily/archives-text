## More Comment on British-Egyptian Dispute 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems to me that a lot of bleeding is being done
tor the unfortunate Egyptians who are currently being
ground into the sands of Suez by the imperial designs
of Great Britain. However, I'm not bleeding and here's
why:
In the first place, it would be folly for Britain to
give up the Suez life-line. True, British methods used
in maintaining control of the Suez seem a bit un
usual. But these are unusual times. The security of
the West may well hinge on the vital Suez.
Secondly, Egypt's El Nahas Pasha would actually
like to see the British stay in Suez as a defensive
screen against the detested Israelis. But under the
prodding of his strongly nationalistic Foreign Minister
Salah el Din, he ordered the evacuation of all British
troops.
The foreign minister also reminded Nahas Pasha
that his government was under fire for the corrupt
mismanagement of Egyptian finances, and that now
was the time to divert attention from his own sins
by denouncing Britains.'
This has always worked in the past and it is work
ing now. When the British were told to get out,
Cairo students were given a day off so that they might
loud-mouth their destructive way through the streets
of the city and further divert attention from their
j>wn government.
'Iliirdly, Egypt itself has definite imperialistic de
signs. To the nationalist Salah el Din. the Suez affair
is secondary. Ilis real aim i.v to latch onto the Anglo-
Egyptian Sudan and thereby control the headwaters
of the Nile which is the life-line of E'.gypt. Apparently
it makes a difference who worries about whose life
line.
Of course the Egyptians are willing to give the Sudan
a separate parliament provided that Egypt could veto
its laws, keep control of military affairs, finance, and
foreign policy Such an acquisition might even provÂ«

lucrative enough to make up the losses sustained by
Farouk at the gaming tables.
The Egyptian students on campus, in a letter to The
Daily, have reminded u.s of our own revolutionary
part and have declared their surprise at the American
attitude toward the Egyptian crisis. They also sug
gested that we send arms etc., to the Egyptian govern
ments.
What for? So the Egyptians might shoot down the
soldiers ol Great Britain, which is our strongest ally
during these troubled times? Tell you what, boys:
if we send arms, money, food etc. to Egypt, will you
sit down and write to the folks back home and make
them promise to stop running around the streets yell
ing "Down with America?"
