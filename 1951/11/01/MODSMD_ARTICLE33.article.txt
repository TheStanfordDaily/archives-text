# Employment Service Finds Diverse Jobs

Want some tutoring in Arabic or Persian?
Or maybe in lacrosse? Or sailing?
Or even in ukulele playing?
If you do, the Stanford Student Employment Office has a man—
or a girl—ready and anxious to teach in those fields. It also has

Eugene W. Dils, director of the
Placement Service, which is in
charge of student employment,
called attention to these and other
talents available among Stanford
students when he released the an
nual report of his office's activities
during the past year.
The report showed that 25.8 per
cent of the men at Stanford and 27.6
per cent of the women had regis
tered with the employment office
for work during the school year.
The 2,510 job applicants filled a
known total of 3,014 part-time jobs.
Maryanna Peterson, manager of
student employment, reported that
the heaviest call for student help
was in manual labor—such activi
ties as gardening, cleanup work,
janitor service, stock work — in
which field the employment service
provided 1,181 jobs.
Next most popular type of em
ployment was that of baby-sitter,
with men and women students
sharing a job in which it is also
possible to do some studying after
Junior is soundly asleep. Three
hundred and thirty-nine Stanford
students got baby - sitting jobs
through the employment service
last year.
Other fields in which large num
bers of students worked were in
waiting on tables off campus, work
ing for room and board in exchange
for various types of services, paint
ing, carpentry, construction work
including television aerial installa
tion, and tutoring everything from
languages to mathematics, tumbling,
and automobile driving.
Occasionally, Mr. Dils reported,
the jobs get into the unusual classi
fications. The employment service
furnished students to conduct a Yo-
Yo contest, remove poison oak, feed
pets while home owners were away,
stand in line for license plates, serve
as models, and once—only once—to
open champagne bottles at a major
social gathering.
Dils pointed out that far more
than 25 per cent of the student body
work while in college. Stanford au
thorities have estimated the total
as being as high as 50 per cent, and
student earnings run into surprising
figures.
For example, the Stanford libra
ries last year employed an average

of 160 students who worked 53.860
hours and earned a total of $43,323
at an average hourly rate of 80
cents.
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
University dining halls, reported
that through her office last year 200
students worked regularly at what
Stanford calls "hashing" jobs, while
the figure for those who "hashed"
anywhere from four to 14 meals a
week ranged up toward 400. And
these figures do not include stu
dents waiting on tables in the Uni
versity's 24 fraternities, where an
average of five or six students wait
on tables in each house.
The approximate value of the
meals earned by the students at
"hashing," a term which also in
cludes dishwashing, bussing dishes,
etc., was reported by Miss Ricker as
$63,604. for the University-operated
dining halls, and it is a conservative
estimate at that, she says. In the
Union units alone, the earned meals
totaled $25,754.
Another major source of student
employment is the Athletic Depart
ment, which has no figures available
for the number of students em
ployed during the year, but reports
that it runs into the thousands.
More than 500 students are em
ployed on Big Game Day alone, 100
of them just to handle traffic.

languages to mathematics, tumbling,
and automobile driving.
Occasionally, Mr. Dils reported,
the jobs get into the unusual classi
fications. The employment service
furnished students to conduct a Yo-
Yo contest, remove poison oak, feed
pets while home owners were away,
stand in line for license plates, serve
as models, and once—only once—to
open champagne bottles at a major
social gathering.
Dils pointed out that far more
than 25 per cent of the student body
work while in college. Stanford au
thorities have estimated the total
as being as high as 50 per cent, and
student earnings run into surprising
figures.
For example, the Stanford libra
ries last year employed an average

of 160 students who worked 53.860
hours and earned a total of $43,323
at an average hourly rate of 80
cents.
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
University dining halls, reported
that through her office last year 200
students worked regularly at what
Stanford calls "hashing" jobs, while
the figure for those who "hashed"
anywhere from four to 14 meals a
week ranged up toward 400. And
these figures do not include stu
dents waiting on tables in the Uni
versity's 24 fraternities, where an
average of five or six students wait
on tables in each house.
The approximate value of the
meals earned by the students at
"hashing," a term which also in
cludes dishwashing, bussing dishes,
etc., was reported by Miss Ricker as
$63,604. for the University-operated
dining halls, and it is a conservative
estimate at that, she says. In the
Union units alone, the earned meals
totaled $25,754.
Another major source of student
employment is the Athletic Depart
ment, which has no figures available
for the number of students em
ployed during the year, but reports
that it runs into the thousands.
More than 500 students are em
ployed on Big Game Day alone, 100
of them just to handle traffic.

Or maybe in lacrosse? Or sailing?
Or even in ukulele playing?
If you do, the Stanford Student Employment Office has a man—
or a girl—ready and anxious to teach in those fields. It also has

Eugene W. Dils, director of the
Placement Service, which is in
charge of student employment,
called attention to these and other
talents available among Stanford
students when he released the an
nual report of his office's activities
during the past year.
The report showed that 25.8 per
cent of the men at Stanford and 27.6
per cent of the women had regis
tered with the employment office
for work during the school year.
The 2,510 job applicants filled a
known total of 3,014 part-time jobs.
Maryanna Peterson, manager of
student employment, reported that
the heaviest call for student help
was in manual labor—such activi
ties as gardening, cleanup work,
janitor service, stock work — in
which field the employment service
provided 1,181 jobs.
Next most popular type of em
ployment was that of baby-sitter,
with men and women students
sharing a job in which it is also
possible to do some studying after
Junior is soundly asleep. Three
hundred and thirty-nine Stanford
students got baby - sitting jobs
through the employment service
last year.
Other fields in which large num
bers of students worked were in
waiting on tables off campus, work
ing for room and board in exchange
for various types of services, paint
ing, carpentry, construction work
including television aerial installa
tion, and tutoring everything from
languages to mathematics, tumbling,
and automobile driving.
