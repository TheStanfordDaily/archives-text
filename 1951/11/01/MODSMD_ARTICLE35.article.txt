# Stanford Mothers' Club Gives Many-Sided Service
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
They furnish the nice clean
sheets, not to mention the beds
in the Rest Homes. They help
provide scholarship money for
students who will work to stay
at Stanford. They provide cloth
ing for those who can't afford
too many changes.
These services sound like those a
mother would provide. And it's
the Stanford Mothers' Club, some
3.000 embers strong, that does pro
vide them.
Tlie organization is 27 years old
and was originally formed to spon
sor the Men's and Women's Rest
Homes on campus. Mrs. Joseph W.
Bingham, whose husband is a pro
fessor of law, emeritus, was the
main force behind the movement.
Actually, many members of the
group are nut mothers of Stan
ford students, but aunts, grand
mothers, or simply women inter
ested in the welfare of the Stan
ford family. The organization is
spread out through ail parts of
the world.
And this world-wide spread cre
ates interesting situations. Due to
the difficulty of sending foreign
currency, many mothers of stu
dents from abroad send their sons
and daughters off for college with
club clues in their wallets.
The Mothers' Club keeps the vil
lain from the Rest Home doors by
paying the rent. It also takes care
of utility and laundry bills, pro
vides for the furnishings, bedding,
and linen, the necessary repairs, and
care of the grounds.
This year's Rest Home budget
adds up to $5,000.
Current budget for another
service, scholarships, amounts to
$-.500 this year. The group tries
not to exceed $100 as a gift to any
individual student. The aim is to

help whore no other help is avail
able. They follow the policies yl
by the ASSU Scholar'ship Com
mittee.
All aid granted from Mothers' !
Club funds to students or organiza- j
tions consists of gilts, not loans. 1
Only regularly registered students,
graduates or undergraduates, are
eligible for financial aid from
Mothers' Club funds.
Club d ues are a dollar a year.
Additional income is derived from \
two annual benefits, and from gifts
of friends and members. The club J
meets on campus at the Women's |
Clubhouse once a month to hear j
student as well as faculty speakers.
This year's on-campus benefit will
be the Chrysanthemum Tea to be j
held Friday from 2 to 4 at the Stan
ford Museum. The rooms will be
open to visitors and decorated with
floral arrangements.
The main object of the Mothers'
Club is to keep in close touch
with University life, and in all
pr: cticahle ways aid the Univer
sity authorities in promoting the
welfare of the student body.
The party is open to all. Tickets
are $1, and will be available at the
door.

Tlie organization is 27 years old
and was originally formed to spon
sor the Men's and Women's Rest
Homes on campus. Mrs. Joseph W.
Bingham, whose husband is a pro
fessor of law, emeritus, was the
main force behind the movement.
Actually, many members of the
group are nut mothers of Stan
ford students, but aunts, grand
mothers, or simply women inter
ested in the welfare of the Stan
ford family. The organization is
spread out through ail parts of
the world.
And this world-wide spread cre
ates interesting situations. Due to
the difficulty of sending foreign
currency, many mothers of stu
dents from abroad send their sons
and daughters off for college with
club clues in their wallets.
The Mothers' Club keeps the vil
lain from the Rest Home doors by
paying the rent. It also takes care
of utility and laundry bills, pro
vides for the furnishings, bedding,
and linen, the necessary repairs, and
care of the grounds.
This year's Rest Home budget
adds up to $5,000.
Current budget for another
service, scholarships, amounts to
$-.500 this year. The group tries
not to exceed $100 as a gift to any
individual student. The aim is to

help whore no other help is avail
able. They follow the policies yl
by the ASSU Scholar'ship Com
mittee.
All aid granted from Mothers' !
Club funds to students or organiza- j
tions consists of gilts, not loans. 1
Only regularly registered students,
graduates or undergraduates, are
eligible for financial aid from
Mothers' Club funds.
Club d ues are a dollar a year.
Additional income is derived from \
two annual benefits, and from gifts
of friends and members. The club J
meets on campus at the Women's |
Clubhouse once a month to hear j
student as well as faculty speakers.
This year's on-campus benefit will
be the Chrysanthemum Tea to be j
held Friday from 2 to 4 at the Stan
ford Museum. The rooms will be
open to visitors and decorated with
floral arrangements.
The main object of the Mothers'
Club is to keep in close touch
with University life, and in all
pr: cticahle ways aid the Univer
sity authorities in promoting the
welfare of the student body.
The party is open to all. Tickets
are $1, and will be available at the
door.
They furnish the nice clean
sheets, not to mention the beds
in the Rest Homes. They help
provide scholarship money for
students who will work to stay
at Stanford. They provide cloth
ing for those who can't afford
too many changes.
These services sound like those a
mother would provide. And it's
the Stanford Mothers' Club, some
3.000 embers strong, that does pro
vide them.
