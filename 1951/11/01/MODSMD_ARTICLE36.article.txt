# Cal, McColl, Kerkorian Tops in PCC Offense
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
California's slightly tarnished
Golden liears still lead the Pacific
Coast Conference in total offence.
Stanford's Saturday opponent, the
Cougars from Washington State, are
next in the offense department, a
tew yards ahead of the third-place
Indians.
A huge 313-yard-per-game aver
age for rushing gives Cal the lead,
even though the Bear passing at
tack is neai' the bottom of the PCC.
Col's total offense per game is a po
tent 4111 yards.

Stanford hits the top of the heap
in only one team statistic. That's
the all-important pass defense. The
tight Card defenses have yielded
only 90 yards per game, and are
more than 20 points better than any
other Coast foe in this department.
In total defense the Southern
California Trojans are the stiffest.
The rugge'J Troy line, backed up by
controversial Pat Cannamela, has
held opposition to 212.7 yards per
(j0 minutes of I jail.
Here are team statistics for de
fen.se and offense for all nine mem
