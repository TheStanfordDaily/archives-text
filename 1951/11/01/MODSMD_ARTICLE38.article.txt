# Meyers Impresses at Half
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Bob Meyers gave notice that he is
ready to go as he ripped off several
; sizeable gains in scrimmage last
night in his new left half position.
The blond boomer from Van
Nuys, Calif., was kept out of the
i Washington tilt as a precautionary
measure. Chuck Taylor didn't want
him to irritate his shoulder-pointer,
1 and besides, Bob Mathias was doing
handsomely at fullback.
The coaching staff decided that
no one was going tu outdo Mathias
i at fullback, so Meyers was shifted
to left half where he will alternate
with Hardy Hugasian.
Hard Scrimmaging
The offense ran through an ex
| tensive passing and running scrim
, mage without any injuries. The
Braves emulated Washington State
and gave the defensive platoon a
workout.
Dutch Fehr in g , who scouted
Washington State in its last three
games, went into superlatives de
j scribing the Cougars' attack to the
Cards. Said Dutch, "They really
impressed me as a very fine ball
club. Washington State is a lot bet
j ter than its press notices. As a
; matter of iact. people don't hear
| much about them, because they
| come from a sparsely populated
I area.
Dangerous Backs
"They have as hard a running
i backfield as I've seen all year.
I Sophomore Bob Burkhart is a dan
| gerous passer, and another sopho
more, 200 - pound Jim Head, was
good enough to beat out veteran
Ray Hobbs at fullback. And Hobbs
i is a good man.
