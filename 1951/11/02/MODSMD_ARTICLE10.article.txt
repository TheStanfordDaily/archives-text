# Student Appeals Traffic Violation
## 
### 
A traffic violation case came bc
| fore Men's Council last night when
a student appealed a parking ticket
given him for parking in a zone
i marked by white paint.
Proceeding on the assumption
that parking rules were not being
J enforced in this particular location
i because of lack of space, the stu
dent, along with several others,
J parked there. After be had parked
in the same place several times, he

I was eventually given a ticket.
Men's Council disallowed the stu
| dent's appeal on the grounds that
| he bad disobeyed the law regardless
| of whether the law had been con-
I sistcntly enforced.
I After deciding the specific case,
I the Council went on to discuss the
campus parking problem in gen
eral and agreed to take steps in an
I attempt to alleviate the situation.
