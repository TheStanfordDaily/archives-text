# Is Stanford Great Or Just Lucky?

### PETE. GROTHE 
A Big Red Machine that is in
deliciously good working order
will try to continue its amazing
climb to the top of the heap when
it hosts upset-primed Washing
ton State in Stanford's Big Brown
Bowl tomorrow. Starting time is
2 p.m.
Approximately 50,000 spectators
will jam into the Stanford Stadium
with one question in mind: "Is this
just a lucky Indian team, or is this
outfit of Chuck Taylor's going to be
one of the great teams in Stanford
history?"
It is not inconceivable that the
1951 Card squad will be mentioned
in the same hallowed tones reserved
for the Vow Boys and Wow Boys.
If the Cards get by the next four
opponents, WSC, Southern Cal, Or
egon State, and Cal,»they will de
serve just such a rating.
But right now. the only thing that
the Farm gridders are worrying
about is Washington State, which
has won four and lost two. Con
trary to reports, they are not "flat."
Dutch Fehring's detailed and com
prehensive scout report has shown
the footballs that WSC is not to
he treated lightly, and the lively
chatter in practice this week indi
cates that Stanford is "high" for
this one.
They have to he, because Coach
Forest Evashevski, a likable and
talented mentor, brings to Stan
ford h team that has averaged
better than 30 points a game (in
cluding 35 against Cal). Fans
from the Palouse country say that
this is the best Cougar outfit since
1941 and is a solid bet for the
Ito«>e Bowl next year.
All the experts believe that WSC
is definitely a better football team
than Washington, and Dutch Feh
ring rates the Cougars as having
"the best offensive backfield I've
I seen this year."

Of the 25 sophomores on the WSC
team, 16 of them were all - state
preps, and seven of the second-year
men will answer the starting bell.
Three of these are in the offensive
backfirld. Quarterback Boh Burk
liart is a blocking back who also
knows how to throw the ball. He
has completed seven touchdown
aerials this year.
Seniors Ray Hobbs and Dick
Bower spearheaded the WSC at-

at the fullback slot. Another soph,
right half Wayne Berry, stepped
into first-string ranks last week and
chalked up three touchdown jaunts
against Oregon.
The fourth reason (or Fehring's
describing the Cougar hackfieM
as ''the best I've seen this year''
is Byron Bailey, a senior. Left
half Bailey is a speed-burner and
is also not bashful about throw
ing passes.
The upstart Cougars would also
claim that their six-foot-three end,
Ed Barker, is as good as Bill McColl
and arc anxious to prove it tomor
row. The other end, Don Stein
brunner, is one of the best offensive
blockers on the coast, as well as be
ing a hairy-chested linebacker.
Washington State has a lot of
guns and will provide a thorough
test of Stanford's Rose Bowl ambi
tions. But if the Cards are to be
come the Cinderella team of the na
tion, they couldn't be in better
shape to achieve that distinction.

Taylor describes as being "worth
