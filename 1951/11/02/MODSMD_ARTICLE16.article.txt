# Two in a Row for Encina
## 
### 
Last night the Fire Department was sum
moned to Encina lor the second night in a row,
only to find another false alarm.
Shouting "fire" as some type of practical
joke can be dangerous business, with no laughs
for anyone. Chief Marston of the Stanford Fire
Department pointed out three dangers inher
ent in any false alarm immediately after last
night's call:
First, there is the danger accompanying the
pursuit of a fire —for the firemen themselves
and for the persons who happen to be between
the blaze and the firehouse.
Second, there is a chance that there might be

two alarms at once, with the firemen going to
the false alarm, while the real fire causes dam
age.
The third danger, which the Chief considers
to be the gravest is the old cry of "wolf." If
too many of these false alarms are sounded
when a real fire occurs it is apt to be considered
just another phony alarm by the men at Encina.
Chasing fires is no game. It costs the fire
department about two hundred dollars every
time two of its rigs are sent out on a call.
The next time anyone is prompted to start a
false alarm, a thought of the consequences
might prevent danger to all concerned.—S.G.
