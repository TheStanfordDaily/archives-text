### PETE GROTHE 
STANFORD BAND MAY fiO ALL THE WAY
At this writing, director Julius Shuchat and his 88
Stanford bandsmen are undefeated and may have an
all-winning season. At least, no one has proven that
they have been out-tooted this year. Up at Washing
ton, the vanguard of 12 band members shamed the
larger Washington aggregation. Although it was a
bit tinny, it drowned out the Husky musical outfit.
These are defensive tactics and perfectly lejfitijnate.

Chuck Taylor's gridders• will
have a tough time tomorrow, but
the tootlers should tuck away
their seventh win in a row. Wash
ington State probably will not
bring down its own band, and a
high school outfit wlil represent
the Cougars. A prep aggregation
should be easy pickings for Stan
ford. The Cards will win by de
fault.
The Trojans will provide the

real test, SC isn't content to form patterns on the
field anil play music. They use' such devices as
smoke screens to aid the performance. Who knows
what surreptitious extra-curricular activities go on
under a smoke screen? Dirty Trojans.
Oregon State is definitely a breather, but Cal will
present a problem. The Bear bandsmen are accurate
on the sharps and flats.
A committee of five map all of the band's stunts.

A large green table represents the field with yard
markers and all. Eighty-eight white blocks are used
to diagram the formations the bands go through. Few
people realize that the band is so scientific. However,
they could go a step further. This is the day of pla
toons. Why can't director Shuchat break the band
clown into offensive and defensive platoons? For ex
ample. the SC band could be playing a piece in ada
gio. and the Indian defensive platoon would break
out in allegro or vivace.
Scout reports show that the Card musicians are
murder on allegro on a delayed count of two.
After the defensive platoon has worn the Trojans
down and the last piccolo player has given up the
ghost, the offensive platoon could take over and
have a clear field. I consider this a splendid idea in
these days of unlimited substitutions.
Word has it that this is Stanford's year. If the band
doesn't come through now, it never will. We lose too
many good men through graduation. The glockinspiel
ranks will be hard-hit. Also, the French horn po
sitions will be vacant, with no good prospects to call
up from the jayvees. The trumpets and clarinets are
in good shape, but the band may lose its number one
piccolo man. Horace Heidt is after him. He may
turn pro.
The musicians are in their best physical shape of
the season, except for one of the tuba players, who
has an injured lip. It seems that he was kissing his
girl good-night, when their dental braces entangled.
The team physician declared him out for the season.

real test, SC isn't content to form patterns on the
field anil play music. They use' such devices as
smoke screens to aid the performance. Who knows
what surreptitious extra-curricular activities go on
under a smoke screen? Dirty Trojans.
Oregon State is definitely a breather, but Cal will
present a problem. The Bear bandsmen are accurate
on the sharps and flats.
A committee of five map all of the band's stunts.

A large green table represents the field with yard
markers and all. Eighty-eight white blocks are used
to diagram the formations the bands go through. Few
people realize that the band is so scientific. However,
they could go a step further. This is the day of pla
toons. Why can't director Shuchat break the band
clown into offensive and defensive platoons? For ex
ample. the SC band could be playing a piece in ada
gio. and the Indian defensive platoon would break
out in allegro or vivace.
Scout reports show that the Card musicians are
murder on allegro on a delayed count of two.
After the defensive platoon has worn the Trojans
down and the last piccolo player has given up the
ghost, the offensive platoon could take over and
have a clear field. I consider this a splendid idea in
these days of unlimited substitutions.
Word has it that this is Stanford's year. If the band
doesn't come through now, it never will. We lose too
many good men through graduation. The glockinspiel
ranks will be hard-hit. Also, the French horn po
sitions will be vacant, with no good prospects to call
up from the jayvees. The trumpets and clarinets are
in good shape, but the band may lose its number one
piccolo man. Horace Heidt is after him. He may
turn pro.
The musicians are in their best physical shape of
the season, except for one of the tuba players, who
has an injured lip. It seems that he was kissing his
girl good-night, when their dental braces entangled.
The team physician declared him out for the season.

STANFORD BAND MAY fiO ALL THE WAY
At this writing, director Julius Shuchat and his 88
Stanford bandsmen are undefeated and may have an
all-winning season. At least, no one has proven that
they have been out-tooted this year. Up at Washing
ton, the vanguard of 12 band members shamed the
larger Washington aggregation. Although it was a
bit tinny, it drowned out the Husky musical outfit.
These are defensive tactics and perfectly lejfitijnate.

Chuck Taylor's gridders• will
have a tough time tomorrow, but
the tootlers should tuck away
their seventh win in a row. Wash
ington State probably will not
bring down its own band, and a
high school outfit wlil represent
the Cougars. A prep aggregation
should be easy pickings for Stan
ford. The Cards will win by de
fault.
