# CAMPUS OPINION
## Another Opinion on Language Requirements 
### 
To the Editor:
in his series of articles Mr. McLean seems to have
overlooked the primary purpose of making foreign
language courses a lower division requirement. Ob
ligatory study of a foreign language, as that of English
and history, is imposed on lower division students
because of the realization that a university has an ob
ligation to each student accepted for matriculation,
the obligation of providing the student with the tools
lor successful iuture study and for a successful busi
ness or professional life.
A reading knowledge of a foreign language, gained
from five quarters of study, is unquestionably a de
ferable and, in fact, necessary means toward this goal.
The entering student, quite understandably, cannot
appreciate the ultimate value of the courses available
to him and hence cannot elect his program wisely. To
help the student, and certainly for no other reason,
both counselors and required courses have become part
of the program for entering students at Stanford. This
program has been selected after considerable thought
and planning. Let us hope it is not abandoned without
considerably more thought and planning.
As a graduate student in bacteriology with class
experience in three language departments at Stanford,
I might suggest to Mr. Volk (author of a past letter
to The Daily) that in my experience the student de
lives from a language course—as from all university
courses—a knowledge of the material proportional to

the effort he has expended in studying it.
