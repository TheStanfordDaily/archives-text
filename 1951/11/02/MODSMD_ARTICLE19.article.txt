# On the Pope's Statement
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Last Tuesday The Daily published a United Press
story ("Pope Bans Rhythm") which was inaccurate in
its presentation of the facts and has caused a gi'eat
deal of confusion.
The article said that "All forms of birth control,
natural 01* artificial, including the so-called 'rhythmic
cycle,' were placed out of bounds to Catholics today
by Pope Pius XII."
This statement is true only so far as it p,oes. It fails
to give the Pope's words that qualify the statement.
He said it was sinful for Catholics "habitually" and
"without a serious motive" to resort to rhythmic birth
control in marital relations to avoid conception. Either
illness of the wife or economic straits may be con
sidered "a serious motive."
This is not a new or different Catholic doctrine.
Pope Pius was merely restating the attitude of the
Church on marriageâ€”one which She has always held.
