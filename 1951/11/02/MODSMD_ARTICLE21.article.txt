of Jesus developed through study
with Dr. Henry Burton Sharman in
1935. In 1946, he participated with
a group of Palo Alto residents in
establishing the Sequoia Seminars
to provide a critical approach to re

modern scientific spirit. Many Stan

seminars in the past few years.
Dr. Rathbun was trained as an
electrical engineer at Stanford and
in 1926 returned to study law. For
! many years, he has arbitrated labor
i disputes on the Pacific Coast.
