## The 						Sporting Line 
### 
The Stanford Indians have soared to national recognition over
night with their amazing winning v/ays. The publicity heaped on
an undefeated, come-through grid power always seems to in
crease the demand for an outstanding player on that squad. This
brings up the peculiar situation of big Bill McColl, Mr. Unbeliev
able of the '51 grid season.

Now tagged as to top draft choice
by most professional teams, Bill and
his desire for med school parallels
another former Farm athlete. That's
Bobby Brown, now Dr. Brown of
the New York baseball Yankees.
Only trouble here is that a football
career is a little more time-con
suming and makes med .school a
near impossibility. That's why Mc-
Coll has been quoted as saying, "If
they can find a way that I can study
medicine and play ball at the same
time, it's fine with me."
This situation of a fine profession- I
al prospect about to pass up playing ■
under the big tent and for the big j
dough points out an often talked
about sports topic here on the Farm. |
How come more Stanford athletes I
don't end up playing for pay?
Nevers Starred
You can count the pro footballers j
on a hand almost. Ernie Nevers i
had the most spectacular career. ;
starring at fullback for the Chicago
Cardinals. Once, against the Bears.
Blond Ernie racked up six touch
downs and four conversions for a '
still-standing record of 40 points.
That was all the Cards scored but j
il was enough for a solid win.
Bruno Banducci, Frank Albert. ;
and Norm Standlee are still enjoy- [
ing long careers with the hot-and- i
cold San Francisco '49ers. Recent |
grad Bobby White has appeared on |
defense for the '49ers a few times
this season.
Vic Lindskog all - proed for the j
Philadelphia Eagles up until this |
year. Now he's an assistant coach j
for the Eagles. Coach Chuck Tay
lor, another Wow Boy member, en- j
joyed a brief career with the now
defunct Miami Seahawks. Hugh j
Gallarneau suited up for the Chi- |
cago Bears and was a member of I
the Midway Monsters' dream back- j
field along with Luckman, Standlee. j
and MacAfee.
List Thins
Now the list begins to thin out. i
Two members of the '46 team, Bill j
Hachten and Fred Boensch, played !
pro ball for a brief period. That j
was for the New York Giants and
the Washington Redskins. Lloyd j
Merriman passed up football for
baseball. Jim Cox had a stay with
the '49ers and then tunned to coach
ing.
One former Card gridder who is j
continuing his football is Boyd
Benson. You don't hear much about I
his play though, as he's being paid [
by Uncle Sam and is a star for the I
Munich Broncos in Germany.

One former Card gridder who is j
continuing his football is Boyd
Benson. You don't hear much about I
his play though, as he's being paid [
by Uncle Sam and is a star for the I
Munich Broncos in Germany.
The Stanford Indians have soared to national recognition over
night with their amazing winning v/ays. The publicity heaped on
an undefeated, come-through grid power always seems to in
crease the demand for an outstanding player on that squad. This
brings up the peculiar situation of big Bill McColl, Mr. Unbeliev
able of the '51 grid season.

Now tagged as to top draft choice
by most professional teams, Bill and
his desire for med school parallels
another former Farm athlete. That's
Bobby Brown, now Dr. Brown of
the New York baseball Yankees.
Only trouble here is that a football
career is a little more time-con
suming and makes med .school a
near impossibility. That's why Mc-
Coll has been quoted as saying, "If
they can find a way that I can study
medicine and play ball at the same
time, it's fine with me."
This situation of a fine profession- I
al prospect about to pass up playing ■
under the big tent and for the big j
dough points out an often talked
about sports topic here on the Farm. |
How come more Stanford athletes I
don't end up playing for pay?
Nevers Starred
You can count the pro footballers j
on a hand almost. Ernie Nevers i
had the most spectacular career. ;
starring at fullback for the Chicago
Cardinals. Once, against the Bears.
Blond Ernie racked up six touch
downs and four conversions for a '
still-standing record of 40 points.
That was all the Cards scored but j
il was enough for a solid win.
Bruno Banducci, Frank Albert. ;
and Norm Standlee are still enjoy- [
ing long careers with the hot-and- i
cold San Francisco '49ers. Recent |
grad Bobby White has appeared on |
defense for the '49ers a few times
this season.
Vic Lindskog all - proed for the j
Philadelphia Eagles up until this |
year. Now he's an assistant coach j
for the Eagles. Coach Chuck Tay
lor, another Wow Boy member, en- j
joyed a brief career with the now
defunct Miami Seahawks. Hugh j
Gallarneau suited up for the Chi- |
cago Bears and was a member of I
the Midway Monsters' dream back- j
field along with Luckman, Standlee. j
and MacAfee.
List Thins
Now the list begins to thin out. i
Two members of the '46 team, Bill j
Hachten and Fred Boensch, played !
pro ball for a brief period. That j
was for the New York Giants and
the Washington Redskins. Lloyd j
Merriman passed up football for
baseball. Jim Cox had a stay with
