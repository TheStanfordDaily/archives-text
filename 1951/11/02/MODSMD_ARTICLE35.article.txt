## 
### 
An enthusiastic group of mineral
sciences professors, including O.
Cutler Shepard, Dean Charles F.
Parks Jr., and C. M. Swinney, take
the spotlight for the faculty this
week in an effort to protect their
four-week-old lead over the stu
dents' team.
The professors, faced with an out
standing panel of econ major foot
ball picking specialists, including
Jerry Hunt, Steve Blumberg, and—

| for the first time In this year's con
' test—a girl, Chryss Stevens, waded
I into this week's slate of games and
came out with the widest assort
ment of selections yet released .
The students did likewise, so
when Saturday's smoke has cleared
I away there is no telling but what
the faculty's seemingly comfortable
lead of 76 per cent correct choices
to 72 per cent may have gone the
way of all undefeated teams.
