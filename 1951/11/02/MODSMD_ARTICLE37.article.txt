Stanford's soccer team was nearly
upset by Santa Clara Wednesday
afternoon, but rallied in the second

tie.
The Cards, unaccustomed to anc
hampered by a small and muddy
field, were scored on by the Bron
cos midway in the first half. In an
attempt to make a save, Stanford
goalie Ben Swan came out a few
yards from the goal. He success
fully blocked the ball, but slipped
and fell in the muck when lie piv
oted back into the cage.
The Santa Clara forward re
trieved the ball and scored with a
ricocheting shot off the post of thi
momentarily unprotected goal.
In the second half the Cards were
a different team. They drove hard
but were able to make good on
:>nly one of their scoring attempts,
a hard shot by left inside Sam Sua
