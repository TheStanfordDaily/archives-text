Coffee hours at Cal are now featuring something new in the
way of afternoon conversation —discussions of profanity in the
UC rooting section. A-Mdtag to tl.e Daily Califor-

nian the profanity problem was the
subjcct discussed at a coflee hour
Wednesday, as a result of charges
leveled at its rooting section in the
Los Angeles Examiner.
Sportswriter Vincent X. Flaherty
j suggested that football be barred by
1 the conference from the Berkeley
stadium as long as Berkeley's root
ing section persists in its "shameful
demonstrations."
Particular examples of the
"shameful demonstrations'' cited
were:
Huge signs raised at the UCLA-
California game last year "con
taining the lowest of four-letter
words"; a pornographic picture
seven feet long and three feet
wide, with reference to USC on
the bottom last week, which Fla
herty could not describe "for ob
vious reasons"; and "vulgar gas
inflated objects floated over the
lield . . . for all of the 81,000
spectators to see . . . mothers,
wives, daughters, sisters, it made
little difference."
A television man at the SC-Cal
game who was afraid to take a shot
ol the rooting section was quoted by
Flaherty as saying "You never
know what they're going to do and
it could cause us no end of trouble
. . . even to the point of being taken
off the air by the Federal Commu
nications Commission."
Thanks to Mr. Flaherty and the
LA. Examiner, coffee-hours at Cal
should be quite stimulating.—S. G.
