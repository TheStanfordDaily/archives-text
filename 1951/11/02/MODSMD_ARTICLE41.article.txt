# Classes Small, Says Sproul
## 
### 
Classes at Cal are not nearly as
large as most people think. Presi
dent Robert G. Sproul reported yes
terday. According to the latest sur
vey, the median-size class for the
fall term of last year was 22.3 stu
dents on the Berkeley campus, 22.7
at UCLA, 18.2 at Davis, and 14.8
at Santa Barbara.
Explaining these figures, Presi
dent Sproul emphasized the fact
that less than 3 per cent of Cal's
classes are the well-publicized lec
ture courses with 200 to 1.000 stu
dent enrollments, and that even
these classes are divided into small
er sections or discussion groups for
more intensive instruction.
Classes tend to be smaller as the
student advances toward his sen
ior year. At the graduate level the
median class is 12 to 13 students.
