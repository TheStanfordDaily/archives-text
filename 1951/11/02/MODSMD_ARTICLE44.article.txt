## 
### 
Fifteen Phi Kappa Sigma frater
nity pledges are using hammers and
saws today in an initiation week
project which will equip their
house with a new storage room.
Chuck Malouf, chapter president,
announced today that the pledges
were put to work Wednesday night
converting a garage into a storage
room for athletic equipment and
house files. They worked yester
day afternoon and evening on the
project and are expected to com
plete the job by this evening.
House Manager Bill Blount, who
drew the plans for the construction
work, said he hopes that the pledges
—who have shown unusual skill at
carpentering and painting — may
have time to refini.sh the chapter's

dining room chains.
The storage room will be equip
ped with electric light and running
water and will also have a work
bench as well as cabinets for garden
tools.
Malouf said that the Phi Kaps
have long had such constructive
house work projects as part of their
initiation procedure.
His announcement came as Palo
Alto "Y" Secretary Paul Meyer ex
pressed the organization's thanks to
the Stanford Alpha Tau Omega
chapter for work done by their
pledges in floor cleaning, painting,
and fence building—a "Help "Week"
project to replace what fraternity
men describe normally as "Heil
Week."
