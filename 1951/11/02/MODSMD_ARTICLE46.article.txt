# Drama to Have Unusual Sets
## 
### 
Stanford Players will present "The
Merchant of Venice" next Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday with an
unusual method of staging.
Dr. A. Nicholas Vardac, director
of the play, stated that the staging
will extend out to the light booth
to the level of the audience. En
trances have been placed in the or
chestra pit with steps leading into
it from two sides.
The fixed architecture type set
ting has been combined with an in
ter-proscenium in the middle of the
stage from behind which the next
set is placed. With this method of
changing the scenery while the play
is being performed in the forestage,
the action of the play will move
continuously with only one inter
mission.
Reservations for the performance
can be made at the Memorial Hall
box office. Price is $1.20.
