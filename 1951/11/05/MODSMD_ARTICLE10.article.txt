## Indians Score Easy 21-13 Win 
### PETE GROTHE 
There'll be 105,000 in the Coliseum this Saturday.
Chuck Taylor's amazing Cinderella team set the stage for the
game of the year by grabbing a 21 to 0 lead and then hanging on
tight around the corners for a 21 to 13 pasting of rugged Wash
ington State last Saturday.
This was Stanford's most decisive victory of the year. The

scoreboard at the end of the stadium
| said 21 to 13, but it cou'd have been
i 28 to 0.
In many ways it was a typical Stan
ford victory. It wouldn't have been
fitting for this 1951 Card team to win
28 to 0. For the seventh time in seven
games the Cards won by just as much
as they needed to. And for the
seventh time in seven games, great
clutch performances spelled victory.
As was the ease last week, this
was the defense's triumph. The
Cougars ripped and snorted all they
wished between the 2ft yard lines,
i but when the chips were down, it
was Tanner, Rye, Kirkland, and
j company who put the squelch on
the kids from the Palouse. The two
j WSC scores were made against the
; second string defense, and even the
j second liners held off hvo scoring
attempts.
The Cougar team that couldn't find
I the end zone against the first string
defense is the same outfit that chalked
up 35 points against Cal and 21
against Southern Cal.
Coach Forest Evashevski's outfit
j took the opening kick-off, and for a
while it appeared as though WSC
j was going to run Stanford out of the
i stadium. Half Byron Bailey and full
back Jim Head alternated to move
the ball to the Stanford 20, where
Chuck Essegian and Leon King
halted the proceedings.
Hie ball exchanged hands, and
Dick Horn, a real star last Saturday,
| intercepted a Burkhart pass on the
! Stanford 25 and followed four man
interference to the Card 46.
This was the cue for Gary Kcr
korian to step in and engineer a
j 54 yard scoring drive with work
manlike precision. It was sun.
quartet-backing that prompted
Chuck Taylor to remark after the
game. "Gary is an All-
American quarterback."
Bob Mathias, who is rapidly be
coming an All-American performer
himself, tested left tackle for eight
and then cracked center of In
line for eight more. A few plays later,
Kerkorian wheeled back to the 10
and rifled a pass to Harry Hugasian,
who stepped out of bounds on the 17.
The Indians never stopped as Ma
thias ripped to the 11, Hugasian to the
seven, and Mathias to the 5. Cook
was arrested with no gain, but hi v
was the Hipster, taking a hand-off
from Kerk right now, and galloping
between left tackle and end for the
remaining five yards.
The quarterback whom Taylor de
scribed as an All-American kicked
the extra point, as he was to do on
two subsequent occasions.
Stanford's next touchdown was
an example of clutch playing. The
Indians took (lie hall on their own
43 and moved it to the WSC 411.
With fourth and two to go, C hnik
Taylor elected to try for a first
down, and Hugasian with that
unique lope of his, picked up thrc
more yards than were necessary.
Kerkorian shot a floater to the 14,
where the end with the most de
pendable pass-catching hooks in
America accepted the pass between
halfs Bud RofTler and Sonny Gallo
way and the sidelines.
Mathias lost one, but McColl set
up the touchdown'by taking a bulivt
on the three. The ever-present Hu
gasian hit for one, and then boomed
into the end zone for the thirteenth
point with nine minutes remaining
in the half.
The Cinderella team drove 80
yards to paydirt in the third quarter
on the strength of a 13 yard run L/
Kerkorian, a 17 yard pass from Kerk
to Cook, and many seven and eight
yard ramblings by Bob Meyers and
Mathias.
The touchdown play itself was
another example of Kerkorian's
wizardry. With fourth down and
V-> yards for a ti'cdee, Cook wei. H
spinning into the center of the line.
; In the meantime Kerkorian stilled
! a yawn as he lazily threw to McColl
all by his lonesome in the end zone.
McColl flipped a lateral to the ref
eree as he tallied, and that was the
extent of the Stanford scoring,
It should be mentioned parentheti
ally that Washington State scored two
.impressive but superfluous touch
downs. Ed Barker, a deadly pass-re
ceiver but a terrible blocker, received
a 39 yard pass and a five yarder from
Burkhart for the scores. The last one
came with 12 seconds remaining, and
Rofller converted.
And so the seventh obstacle in Stan
ford's way to the Rose Bowl has been
removed. Can Stanford come through
j against the biggest obstacle, SC, next
j week?
105,000 people will he on hand to
find out.

Chuck Taylor's amazing Cinderella team set the stage for the
game of the year by grabbing a 21 to 0 lead and then hanging on
tight around the corners for a 21 to 13 pasting of rugged Wash
ington State last Saturday.
This was Stanford's most decisive victory of the year. The

scoreboard at the end of the stadium
| said 21 to 13, but it cou'd have been
i 28 to 0.
In many ways it was a typical Stan
ford victory. It wouldn't have been
fitting for this 1951 Card team to win
28 to 0. For the seventh time in seven
games the Cards won by just as much
as they needed to. And for the
seventh time in seven games, great
clutch performances spelled victory.
As was the ease last week, this
was the defense's triumph. The
Cougars ripped and snorted all they
wished between the 2ft yard lines,
i but when the chips were down, it
was Tanner, Rye, Kirkland, and
j company who put the squelch on
the kids from the Palouse. The two
j WSC scores were made against the
; second string defense, and even the
j second liners held off hvo scoring
attempts.
The Cougar team that couldn't find
I the end zone against the first string
defense is the same outfit that chalked
up 35 points against Cal and 21
against Southern Cal.
Coach Forest Evashevski's outfit
j took the opening kick-off, and for a
while it appeared as though WSC
j was going to run Stanford out of the

back Jim Head alternated to move
the ball to the Stanford 20, where
Chuck Essegian and Leon King
halted the proceedings.

quartet-backing that prompted
Chuck Taylor to remark after the
game. "Gary is an All-
American quarterback."
Bob Mathias, who is rapidly be
coming an All-American performer
himself, tested left tackle for eight
and then cracked center of In
line for eight more. A few plays later,
Kerkorian wheeled back to the 10
and rifled a pass to Harry Hugasian,
who stepped out of bounds on the 17.
The Indians never stopped as Ma
thias ripped to the 11, Hugasian to the
seven, and Mathias to the 5. Cook
was arrested with no gain, but hi v
was the Hipster, taking a hand-off
from Kerk right now, and galloping
between left tackle and end for the
remaining five yards.
The quarterback whom Taylor de
scribed as an All-American kicked
the extra point, as he was to do on
two subsequent occasions.
Stanford's next touchdown was
an example of clutch playing. The
Indians took (lie hall on their own
43 and moved it to the WSC 411.
With fourth and two to go, C hnik
Taylor elected to try for a first
down, and Hugasian with that
unique lope of his, picked up thrc
more yards than were necessary.
Kerkorian shot a floater to the 14,
where the end with the most de
pendable pass-catching hooks in
America accepted the pass between
halfs Bud RofTler and Sonny Gallo
way and the sidelines.
Mathias lost one, but McColl set
up the touchdown'by taking a bulivt
on the three. The ever-present Hu
gasian hit for one, and then boomed
into the end zone for the thirteenth
point with nine minutes remaining
in the half.
The Cinderella team drove 80
yards to paydirt in the third quarter
on the strength of a 13 yard run L/
Kerkorian, a 17 yard pass from Kerk
to Cook, and many seven and eight
yard ramblings by Bob Meyers and
Mathias.
The touchdown play itself was
another example of Kerkorian's
wizardry. With fourth down and
V-> yards for a ti'cdee, Cook wei. H

all by his lonesome in the end zone.
McColl flipped a lateral to the ref
eree as he tallied, and that was the
extent of the Stanford scoring,
It should be mentioned parentheti
ally that Washington State scored two
.impressive but superfluous touch
downs. Ed Barker, a deadly pass-re
ceiver but a terrible blocker, received
a 39 yard pass and a five yarder from
Burkhart for the scores. The last one
came with 12 seconds remaining, and
Rofller converted.
And so the seventh obstacle in Stan

tight around the corners for a 21 to 13 pasting of rugged Wash

In many ways it was a typical Stan
ford victory. It wouldn't have been
fitting for this 1951 Card team to win
28 to 0. For the seventh time in seven
games the Cards won by just as much
as they needed to. And for the
seventh time in seven games, great
clutch performances spelled victory.
