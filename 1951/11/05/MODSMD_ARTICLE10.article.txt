# CARDS CLOBBER COUGARS; SC NEXT
## Indians Score Easy 21-13 Win 
### PETE GROTHE 
There'll be 105,000 in the Coliseum this Saturday.
Chuck Taylor's amazing Cinderella team set the stage for the
game of the year by grabbing a 21 to 0 lead and then hanging on
tight around the corners for a 21 to 13 pasting of rugged Wash
ington State last Saturday.
This was Stanford's most decisive victory of the year. The

scoreboard at the end of the stadium
| said 21 to 13, but it cou'd have been
i 28 to 0.
In many ways it was a typical Stan
ford victory. It wouldn't have been
fitting for this 1951 Card team to win
28 to 0. For the seventh time in seven
games the Cards won by just as much
as they needed to. And for the
seventh time in seven games, great
clutch performances spelled victory.
As was the ease last week, this
was the defense's triumph. The
Cougars ripped and snorted all they
wished between the 2ft yard lines,
i but when the chips were down, it
was Tanner, Rye, Kirkland, and
j company who put the squelch on
the kids from the Palouse. The two
j WSC scores were made against the
; second string defense, and even the
j second liners held off hvo scoring
attempts.
The Cougar team that couldn't find
I the end zone against the first string
defense is the same outfit that chalked
up 35 points against Cal and 21
against Southern Cal.
Coach Forest Evashevski's outfit
j took the opening kick-off, and for a
while it appeared as though WSC
j was going to run Stanford out of the
i stadium. Half Byron Bailey and full
back Jim Head alternated to move
the ball to the Stanford 20, where
Chuck Essegian and Leon King
halted the proceedings.
Hie ball exchanged hands, and
Dick Horn, a real star last Saturday,
| intercepted a Burkhart pass on the
! Stanford 25 and followed four man
interference to the Card 46.
This was the cue for Gary Kcr
korian to step in and engineer a
j 54 yard scoring drive with work
