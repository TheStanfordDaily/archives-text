## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 4 (UP)â€”For- i
mer President Herbert Hoover said !
today that Congress needs a new j
"watchdog" group, in addition to its
regular committees, to ride herd on
mounting federal spending.
In a letter to Sen. Henry Cabot
Lodge Jr.. (R-Mass.), Mr. Hoover'
; said that a new screening agency for '
congressional appropriations is "es- j
sential" now that the annual total of,
| money bills runs into many billions. |
Lodge had solicited the ex-presi
dent's views on a bill he introduced '[
! before Congress adjourned.
Lodge's proposal would establish a .
joint committee on rearmament ap- '
! propriations and give it a staff of;
experts qualified to challenge and j
j check on budget requests sent to I
| Congress by the White House.
