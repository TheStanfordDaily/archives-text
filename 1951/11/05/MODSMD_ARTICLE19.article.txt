# REBATE DAY DAWNS AGAIN
## 
### 
Tomorrow is rebate day at the
Bookstore.
Between the hours of 0 and 11 a.m.
and 2 and 4 p.m., the Stanford Book
store business office will be open to
pay students their additional seven
and a half per cent rebate on last
year's purchases.
The rebate payments will continue
after tomorrow until all of the addi
tional surplus dividends are paid.
Mrs. Helena Bauchou, manager of
the Bookstore, explained that there
is no immediate deadline by which
the payments must be picked up.
The additional seven and a half
per cent brings last year's dividend
percentage to 22'/z. This amount,
totaling nearly $100,000, is the second
greatest rebate in recent years. It
is surpassed by a 25 per cent rebate
paid in tlie peak years right after
World War 11, when Stanford's en
rollment and the Bookstore volume
more than doubled in size.

Tliis year's increase turned up whon
the annual Bookstore audit revealed
a surplus profit. The reason for the
profit was Riven by J. Hugh Jackson,
dean of the Graduate School of Busi
ness and president of the Bookstore
Board of Directors.
Jackson explained that the fiscal
year of the Bookstore ends each Sept.
1, and in order to pay rebates in June,
it is necessary to make an estimate of
the final sales figure.
This year bccause of an expected
decrease in summer enrollment, the
rebate percentage was scaled at a
conservative 15 per cent. When the
summer enrollment, and accordingly
the Bookstore business, did not suffer
a summer slump, the surplus ap
peared. â€¢
The additional rebate, Jackson said,
is no rare occurrence. It has occurred
several times in recent years, al
though not during the immediate past
four years.
