## 
### 
TOKYO. Monday, Nov. 5 (UP) — \
| Allied negotiators were reported |
ready to make the Reds a new offer
; on control of Kaesong as the truce
j negotiators met in Panmunjon today
\ faced with the severest crisis since i
| the peace talks resumed.
The talks bogged down yesterday 1
in a dispute about the future status 1
of Kaesong. former truce city now
j controlled by the Reds.
Allied negotiators were reported
ready to make a new offer on the
question of the disputed town, but it
was unlikely that they would grant
♦he Communist demand for undis- i
puted control of the area.
Unofficial Communist sources said
flic Reds would rather sec the talks
j break down altogether than agree
to any settlement thai would weak
en tlieir hold on Kaesong itself or
Pine Tree Peak, the I.JjOO foot
mountain crest rising behind the
town.
At yesterday's meeting tho Com- .
muni.sts refused even to discuss an
Allied proposal which would have
placed Kaesong in a demilitarized
zone.
As the joint negotiating subcom
mittee met at 11 a.m. today for the
twelfth straight day, it appeared that
only a new offer by one side cr an
! other could break the deadlock.
"The next move appeared to be
up to the United Nations." a dis
patch from the Allied camp at Mun
ssn said. "'The UN may make a
specific offer regarding Kaesong. in
distinction to the informal proposal
made Saturday.
That proposal was that Kaesong be
demilitarized as a sort of neutral nn
i man's land between the lines on
which the Korean shooting would ;
I stop.
