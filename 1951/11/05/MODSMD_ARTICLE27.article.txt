# Partisan Politics at Stanford
## 
### 
Excorn took a significant step last week when
they finally gave their approval to the Young
Republicans' request for campus recognition.
The action came after a three week debate.
True, until the Board of Trustees gives official
approval, the Excom action means little as far
as immediate plans for the club are concerned.
The Young Republicans still can't meet on cam
pus, for instance.
But we interpret the Excom action as a
move of basic importance. It shows our stu
dent representatives think political expres
sion at Stanford is inadequate and in need of
a booster.
During Excom debate the members didn't
agree perfectly about the solution to the prob
lem of political deadness here. Some favored
a non-partisan approach. But all agreed with
the old theory that is an Ivory Tower
as far as partisan political activity is concerned.
We too agree with the Ivory Tower idea. This
campus ducks politics like sin. Never is a con
troversial political speaker heard. Seldom is
a political debate involving students held. Cer
tainly it is not a basic lack of interest among
students that is responsible. Most college stu
dents are interested in politics and most are
willing to argue constructively on the subject.
A college campus seems the logical spot
to channel political interest and argumenta
tive spirit into the educative process. It could
be done at Stanford by allowing students to
hear outstanding political speakers, or to put
it bluntly, politicians. Students should be al
lowed to join political groups on campus, too.
Now it would be foolish to assume that this
year's Excom is the first to worry about the
problem. In 1948 the talk became hot and
heavy, and former Dean of Students Lawrence
Kimpton felt obliged to answer the old ques
tion, "Why shouldn't a student be allowed to
join a partisan political group at Stanford?"
Kimpton replied:
1. The University's primary purpose is ed

ucation. The primary purpose of political
action groups is propaganda.
2. Student political groups are under pies
sure to be used as a front tor outside organi
zations.
3. Stanford might be unwittingly committed
to a political stand by one of these student
groups.
Powerful arguments, these. Of course edu
cation is the primary purpose of a University,
but aren't politics and propaganda both factor:
in a good education?
Under the tight rules of the Board of Trustees
and the Public Exercises committee, it seems
unlikely that Stanford is going to suffer from
having student political groups. Surely the
University can easily avoid being committed
to a political stand. Some control by the Uni
versity is necessary, but if handled intelligently
it shouldn't hamstring ALL political activity as
it does today.
Politics on campus is an issue that never
dies, which is proof, perhaps, that it is a real
issue. It will soon be before Excom again. The
Young Republican approval was only a short
range answer. Both students and administra
tion are aware of this. For instance, there was
much talk by Excom about a forum committee
to invite outstanding political speakers to cam
pus.
We think there is a need for some sort of
policy to replace the flat ban on political
meetings and speakers which is now in effect.
New policy may be expected soon.
This policy should definitely outline what
can and cannot be done politically on campus.
It should be liberal enough to allow intelligent
student political activity, preferably through
campus political clubs. The policy should also
allow political speakers to talk here, provided
they don't make mere campaign speeches.
Surely some sort of regulation can be found
which will strike a balance between the two
poles of "no politics" and "all politics."
