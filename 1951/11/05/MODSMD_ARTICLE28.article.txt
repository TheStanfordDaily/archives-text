### DICK McLEAN 
THE BEES
With the first timid fingers of dawn a bee scout
hovers with wings buzzing and antenna twitching high
aijove the Cellar. This little fellow is the advance
reconnaissance unit for Beehive Number 13, sometimes
called fearfully the Cellar Marauder

Patiently he waits and finally his
waiting is rewarded. The board
across the window comes down.
The acrid smell of Cellar coffee
and the sweet scent of fruit juices
drift out and upward in the morn
ing air. The bee scout radios in
using the code of the day.
"Bee Baker to hive. Bee Ba
ker to hive. Condition is rose
bud. Scramble."
Beehive Number 13 bolts into

action as the tense message echoes throughout the wax
chambers. On the runway the various units are warm
ing up their wings and loading their stingers. The air
is tense. Then the queen bee's voice booms over the
public address system.
'"lliis is the big show. boys. Give 'em hell."
"Kighto," answer the bees as they take off within
the thunder of their own beating wings.
In tight formation they fly, wing tip to wirig tip.
Upward toward the sun they climb, the rear units
closing upon the vanguard. Over the rolling foothills,
across the green fields, on they come. The sky seems
filled with their number and noise.
They enter the campus from the northwest, sweep
lo'.v over Lake Lagunita, then zoom up again and
loop around Hoover Tower. Out of the sun they will
attack.
The poor attendant at the Cellar is on his alert. The
Gardner Bee Trap Automatic Death Ray Machine with
its tempting bait stands ready. In the bird cage the
strychnine marinated liver dangles invitingly. When
the attendant hears the roar from the east and squints
into the hot sun, he knows.

"Here they come," he shouts while pumping des- (
perately on his DDT sprayer.
Unit by unit the Cellar Marauder Squadron peels of!
and screams in for the attack. Through the deadly
clouds of poison gas come the first wave. One bee is
hit. His left wing turns askew. He loses control. Down j
in a tight circle he spins. Down, down until he dashes
his young life on the concrete below. (He was just a
kid. His first mission. Tough break.)
The coffee drinkers are left to the mercy of the
bees. The winged invaders fight in groups of five.
Two circle the face of the victim while two perch in
his ears whispering dire threats. The fifth bee helps
himself to coffee or doughnuts or whatever he wants.
One greedy bee leans over too far on the rim of
a cup and falls in. He slips unseen beneath the !
murky surface. He will be discovered only when
the coffee drinker downs that last swallow. (Such
a terrible end!)
One student grows a little too flip in dusting a bee i
off his donut. The insect retreats five feet and then
takes careful aim with his stinger. He makes proper J
allowance for deflection and wind drift. Just as the
student turns to walk away ... a direct hit.
The bees look curiously at the Gardner Bee Trap
Automatic Death Ray Machine and the poison liver.
They carefully read the warnings and laughingly fly
off. (These are superior bees. Otherwise they wouldn't |
be at Stanford.)
All day long the battle rages. There are casualties
on both sides but the hoys from Hive Number 13 win
the day. They put the Cellar occupants in complete
rout.
At four-thirty the board goes back in the window. !
The janitor who comes to sweep carries his white lla".
The victorious squadron regroups and flys home in 1
formation.
"Good show. Eh what?" says the group commander
to the group sub-commander.
"I still don't like Cellar coffee," answers the sullen
sub-commander to the group commander.
