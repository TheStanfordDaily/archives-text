## Egyptian Student Argues His Case 
### 
To the Editor:
It seems futile to sit down and answer the many
litters published in 'Die Daily from the pro-British
.side on the Egyptian case, especially when some of
them contain harsh and unkind words. We shall, there
fore, have to be satisfied with presenting our final
arguments on the case and let the readers be the
judges.
First, the 1936 treaty between Britain and Egypt
was concluded under the influence of British occu
pation and the Egyptian party did not enjoy at that
time necessary right of complete and free choice. This
was a view taken by the late Mr. Bevin himself, who
announced it when the dispute between Russia and
Iran was brought before the security council.
Secondly, the treaty contradicts the Suez Canal Con
vention on the one hand and the U.N. Charter on the
other. Both of these have the priority of execution
and respect The U.N. Charter forbids that nations
encroach on the independence of other nations or
question the unity of their territories. It asserts the

right of nations in self-determination and provide;;
within its texts for the equality of sovereignty among
member states.
And."according to the Sue/ Canal convention which
was concluded in 1888 th<- signatory parties ere for
bidden to seek any particular privileges whether re -
gional, commercial or otherwise, through interna
tional agreements.
Thirdly, the United Kingdom herself has ag..in anil
again violated the treaty.
Since 1946 the Egyptian government has been trying
to negotiate with the Government of ('rent Britain
with an idea of revising the treaty of 193G and super
seding it witfya treaty that might be more appropriate
to the new international outlook. This action is al
lowed for by the terms of the treaty itself. However,
the British have repeatedly refund to respond even
after Egypt's bringing up the case before the Security
Council in 1949
You will realize, therefore, that Egypt. in cancelling
the 1936 treaty, ir, only acting within h<-r 1< >1 rigtli:
