## 
### 
WASHINGTONâ€”Gen. Dwight D. j
Eisenhower flew here tonight to re
port to President Truman on the J
progress of Western European re
armament and to urge a drastic
speed-up in the flow of American
arms overseas.
Eisenhower also is expected to go j
into the question of whether Allied
military mobilization goals can bo j
safely lowered as a result of the :
development of new tactical atomic
weapons which possibly can be sub- j
stituted for manpower.
Other problems likely to be cov
ered during his two days of confer- j
ences here include Spanish bases, j
German rearmament, establishment
of North Atlantic treaty commands
in the Mediterranean and North At
lantic, military aid to Yugoslavia,
and related problems in arming
other free nations.
