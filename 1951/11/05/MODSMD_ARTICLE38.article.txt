# Cal Expects Book Thieves
## 
### 
"You'd better watch out . . .
Santa Claus is coming to town."
With the approaching holiday
season, Berkeley students will have
to hold on tighter to their books as
the University of California police
warned that book thieves are more
prevalent during this period.
As reported in the Daily Califor
nian, Sergeant Halleran of the Cal
cops urged students to be on the
lookout for the book thieves. It
seems that there is always an up
surge of thefts at this time due to
the need for extra spending money.
Said the Californian, "Recently,
there was the case of the theft of a
portable typewriter from a student's
car merely because he had been
careless enough to leave it un
locked."
The Cal students have therefore
been cautioned against leaving
books anywhere unattended, and
the police also urged that all lock
ers and cars be closed securely and
locked.
