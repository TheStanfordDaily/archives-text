# Gaieties' Stage Crew Needs Additional Props for Show
## 
### GLORIA BRECKENRIDGE 
Wanted; a park bench, a Jew's
harp and a feather duster. Gaie
ties has its cast, now the call is
out for a variety of necessary
props.
Many props have already been se
cured. What can't be bought, the
crew builds, although many helpful
people in Palo Alto and around cam
pus have donated several items.
One of the crew's first projects
| was a large skeleton that was built
from wood with chicken wire hands
and feel. He's all dressed for his
part and will have a lead role in the
skit about the library.
A futuristic skit entitled "Space
Patrol" calls for a supersonic com
municator machine, and the crew is
still puzzling over how they will work
this one out. Three metallic space
helmets and atomic ray guns also
called for some imagination to build.
Animals and people have to come
tumbling down from the ceiling in
one of the musical numbers, but as
yet there's no solution for this
staging problem either.
The Health Service helped the crew
out by contributing most of the neces
sary instruments for the Dr. Kildarc
skit. The Corp Yard loaned a ccment
buggy that will be used as a portable
ambulance, and last week crew mem
bers wheeled it down Quad to Me
morial Auditorium.
More unique props that will be
used arc a pair of Russian dueling
pistols, a black jack — filled with
cotton —and signal flags.
About 200 props will be used dur
ing showtime, and crew members
have only the short time between
skits to set scenes. Prop wagons will
be at both sides of the stage so that
a rapid change can be made, and be
twecn-the-sccnes skits will help the
show run smoothly.
Corrine Litvin, chairman of the
crew — along with Ward Manning,
Rhoda Wolf, Kay Johnson, and Dot
Green — work every afternoon and
evening as well as Saturday morning
on juat this one phase of Gaieties pro
duction.
