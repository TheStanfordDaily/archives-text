# Derwent Lauds Students For Enthusiastic Acting
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
"As a whole, I have found stu
dent actors keen, enthusiastic
ally eager to learn, and able to
think for themselves," declares
Clarence Derwent, distinguished
actor who is currently rehears
ing his role of Shylock for the
University Theatre's production
of "The Merchant of Venice."
This competent thespian, who has
been the president of Actor's Equity
Association for the past six years,
received his early theatrical training
in the Benson and Manchester reper
tory companies, which put on mostly
classical Greek and Shakespearean
dramas.
This sort of training, he affirms, is
best for aspiring actors and actresses,
and he deplores the fact that such
institutions do not exist today, the
closest things being Margaret Web
ster's company in America and the
Old Vic in London.
In the approximately 50 years that
he has been connected with the
theatre, Derwent has built up two
traditions. The first is that he has
never missed a performance, even
going on with an acute ease of laryn
gitis.
The sccond is his rccord of
Shakespearean portrayals. He has
acted in every Shakespearean play
hut three, and hopes to reduce that
number to two this year by appear
ing in ANTA's production of "Ti
iqoii of Athens."
The role of Shylock, while not bis
favorite (he accords that honor to the
part of lago in "Othello") is one of
the most challenging of his career.
In early days, Shylock was depicted
either as a low clown or consumate
villain. Sir Henry Irving was the
first to play the role sympathetically,
and Derwent follows Sir Henry's con
ception.
Although regarding movies as pos
sessing "corrosive elements that sear
the soul," he does admit that movies
such as "The Well," "The River," and
"The Blue Veil" give hope of cultural
advancement being made in Holly
wood.
Even after playing with such stars
as Kathcrinc Cornell and Helen
Hayes, Derwent says that there is
no first lady of the theatre today.
"There arc no more actresses like
Sarah Bernhardt, Elcanora Dusc,
and Ellen Terry," he asserts.
ANTA (American National Theatre
Academy), of which he is vice-chair
man, is recognized by Clarence Der
went and many other actors as the
lifeline of the theatre.

UNION UNITS, VENTURA, AND
UNION RESIDENCE must return
Quad picture proofs tomorrow
evening from 5 to 7:30 in the
