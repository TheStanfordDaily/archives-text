# Stanford Over Troy, with Work,' Taylor
## Evashevski and Card Mentor Praise Alert Indian defense 
### DICK KLEIN 
Perched on o bright red pad in the training room Saturday,
Coach Chuck Taylor, Stanford's all-winning coaching phenom,
easily grinned his way through some red-hot questions in an
after-the-victory interview.
"A prediction? Give me a little timo to think it over. Oh, heck!

Can't yet'oil tin- bandwagon now.
Not while we're winning. Sure,
well I jt-iit SC," is how the happy
headman of the red-hot Indians put
away the $(i4 question.
"We need lots of improvement
before SC. Yes, nl! the way around.
"But, we had a real passing test
today, and we held up pretty well
with the top combination of Horn.
Thompson, and Sanders in there.
Didn't we?
"That Southern Cal is a great
team. They're the tou hest team
defensively we'll meet. Gifford is
the cla>s of the coast us a runner.
Good movements. But we'll be as
well physically as possible against
Sl7. We will play our best game."
WSC: a Good Workout
He admitted that playing against
Washington State's single-wing of
fense was a good workout in prep
aration for the Trojans . Southern
California's formation is a little dif
ferent with most passing done from
a T. ''Yes, we had George Lynn
scouting the Army-SC game for us.
But he won't be able to learn much
from that game. We have them well
scouted from earlier games."
What did Chuck Taylor have to
say about Saturday's surprisingly
easy victory over what he had pre
dicted to be "the toughest game on
our schedulel'? "The defense, once
again, played a hell of a game.
Washington State was stopped for
the first time this season. And in a
convincing manner, too.
"The kids came up for the game
nicely. It was hard for us to get
going again after building up the
14-point lead. Didn't Gary do a nice
job of pulling them together and
sparking that third touchdown,
though?"
He explained the defense had
trouble getting adjusted to the
over-shifting on the first series, but
after that it was okay. Mixed up
the defense with a seven-man line
against the running and then later
a wide six against the Hurry of
parses.
"We had a look at everybody this
time. Except for a couple on de
fense and four men on offense, we
cleared the bench. Funny, isn't it?
We couldn't even do that against
San Jose."
Card Reserves Played Well
Chuck liked the way some of the
übs played. Bobby Bryan ran well
and hard. He said that Bryan would
be used more, and the same for Skip
lyrist, the "hard - luck kid," who
played well on both offense an de
fense. It was the first varsity game
for several, including Wynn Wedge,
Mat Armitage. Dave Worley, Bob
Hoegh, and John Gilmorc.
About Washington State? "We
played 'em for runs instead of
passes. That's the way it worked
out. Sure, we had a couple of
scares later on when Burkhardt
started throwing against our re
serves. They were a tough team.
And, boy, how'd you like those
ends? You don't find much better
ends than that Barker. And that
other end (Stcinbi unnor) was a hell
of a blocker."
What did you think of Kerko
rian's play-calling? "Excellent. That
was All-America stuff out there. He
and McColl are great. McColl is
playing 100 per cent better than last
year. He's always there in the
clutches. And blocking like he nev
er had before."
Kunning Attack Needs Work
Not entirely pleased with the
running attack which can stand im
proving to stop the "sputtering,"
he cited Wes Laubseher and Bobby
Meyers, until his bad shoulder got
bumped, as turning in good per
formances.
Concerning what many thought
were "doubtful" calls, the headman
explained the unsportsmanlike con
due! call was against, Ron Eadie for
banging into the passer after Burk
hardt had thrown the ball. Eadie
wa already diving at the Cougar
quarter and was unable to stop his
motion. "He's not the kind of a boy
to pull any of that stuff."

And about the pas : interference,
he called it a "tough call," "What
do you think?" To mo t, it looked
like the Cougar end (Barker) trip
ped over the Indian defender (Cas
telucci).
In tiie dressing room itself there
was none of the loud noise and hap
piness that would be expected after
a win in the season's crucial before
the crucial. Players went about
their chores in a business-like man
ner. There was .some back-slapping,
and the coach went about the room
talking to most of the players indi
vidually. He was glad when John
Brodtriek, big offensive tackle, ex
plained away his bad thigh as only
a charlie-hor.e.
Chuck Grins to All
The yells anil band music were
audible inside the gym and seemed
to be well appreciated. The players
chided Taylor when the crowd
broke into a "We want Chuck"
chant. The coach smiled and shook
his head. Then, after Yellman Tom
Randolph barged in and asked
Chuck if he'd come out, he did. He
stepped outside to the cheers, ac
cepted the student body's acclaim,
and ducked back inside with only a
big wave and grin.
Over across the court in the other
dressing room, the Cougars were
also quiet. Most agreed that they
had'lost to a better team. But many
felt that Stanford was in for a
rough afternoon against the swifl
and - rough Trojans. Guard Pete
Rademacher said that Stanford
wouldn't be able to hold Southern
Cal. And the giant tackle, the well
proportioned G-l't. 7-in. Howie Mc-
Cants, offered an "SC is a better
ball club."
Forrest Evashevski, the unsung
blocking back who cleared Tommy
Harmon's way to Michigan fame,
felt that his Washington State team
had played their worst game of the
season.
"I just don't know what Stan
ford's got. They're not a great ball
club. They get the job done, and
that's all."
Asked whether he thought the
final score was indicative of the
team difference, "Heck, no. They
could have beaten us even more.
Chuck used lots of reserves late in
the game."
Out of the predictions, comments,
and interviews, one thing sliopes up
for sure. That's the SC-Stanford
tilt should be a real pier - house
brawl with the game going either
way. According to some, Stanford
is tho strongest defensive ■ team on
the Coast. Chuck Taylor thinks the
Trojans are the toughest defensive
ly.
It could be a low-scoring, defen
sive battle. That's the way it should
be, but when two teams play for the
top prize one often explodes. Any
body have some extra ducats? The
game shapes up as a solid sell-out
in the big-capacity Coliseum, which
should make Al Masters and Don
Liebendorfer very happy.

against the running and then later
a wide six against the Hurry of
parses.
"We had a look at everybody this
time. Except for a couple on de
fense and four men on offense, we
cleared the bench. Funny, isn't it?
We couldn't even do that against
San Jose."
Card Reserves Played Well
Chuck liked the way some of the
übs played. Bobby Bryan ran well
and hard. He said that Bryan would
be used more, and the same for Skip
lyrist, the "hard - luck kid," who
played well on both offense an de
fense. It was the first varsity game
for several, including Wynn Wedge,
Mat Armitage. Dave Worley, Bob
Hoegh, and John Gilmorc.
About Washington State? "We
played 'em for runs instead of
passes. That's the way it worked
out. Sure, we had a couple of
scares later on when Burkhardt
started throwing against our re
serves. They were a tough team.
And, boy, how'd you like those
ends? You don't find much better
ends than that Barker. And that
other end (Stcinbi unnor) was a hell
of a blocker."
What did you think of Kerko
rian's play-calling? "Excellent. That
was All-America stuff out there. He
and McColl are great. McColl is
playing 100 per cent better than last
year. He's always there in the
clutches. And blocking like he nev
er had before."
Kunning Attack Needs Work
Not entirely pleased with the
running attack which can stand im
proving to stop the "sputtering,"
he cited Wes Laubseher and Bobby
Meyers, until his bad shoulder got
bumped, as turning in good per
formances.
Concerning what many thought
were "doubtful" calls, the headman
explained the unsportsmanlike con
due! call was against, Ron Eadie for
banging into the passer after Burk
hardt had thrown the ball. Eadie
wa already diving at the Cougar
quarter and was unable to stop his
motion. "He's not the kind of a boy
to pull any of that stuff."

And about the pas : interference,
he called it a "tough call," "What
do you think?" To mo t, it looked
like the Cougar end (Barker) trip
ped over the Indian defender (Cas
telucci).
In tiie dressing room itself there
was none of the loud noise and hap
piness that would be expected after
a win in the season's crucial before
the crucial. Players went about
their chores in a business-like man
ner. There was .some back-slapping,
and the coach went about the room
talking to most of the players indi
vidually. He was glad when John
Brodtriek, big offensive tackle, ex
plained away his bad thigh as only
a charlie-hor.e.
Chuck Grins to All
The yells anil band music were
audible inside the gym and seemed
to be well appreciated. The players
chided Taylor when the crowd
broke into a "We want Chuck"
chant. The coach smiled and shook
his head. Then, after Yellman Tom
Randolph barged in and asked
Chuck if he'd come out, he did. He
stepped outside to the cheers, ac
cepted the student body's acclaim,
and ducked back inside with only a
big wave and grin.
Over across the court in the other
dressing room, the Cougars were
also quiet. Most agreed that they
had'lost to a better team. But many
felt that Stanford was in for a
rough afternoon against the swifl
and - rough Trojans. Guard Pete
Rademacher said that Stanford
wouldn't be able to hold Southern
Cal. And the giant tackle, the well
proportioned G-l't. 7-in. Howie Mc-
Cants, offered an "SC is a better
ball club."
Forrest Evashevski, the unsung
blocking back who cleared Tommy
Harmon's way to Michigan fame,
felt that his Washington State team
had played their worst game of the
season.
"I just don't know what Stan
ford's got. They're not a great ball
club. They get the job done, and
that's all."
Asked whether he thought the
final score was indicative of the
team difference, "Heck, no. They
could have beaten us even more.
Chuck used lots of reserves late in
the game."
Out of the predictions, comments,
and interviews, one thing sliopes up
for sure. That's the SC-Stanford
tilt should be a real pier - house
brawl with the game going either
way. According to some, Stanford
is tho strongest defensive ■ team on
the Coast. Chuck Taylor thinks the
Trojans are the toughest defensive
ly.
It could be a low-scoring, defen
sive battle. That's the way it should
be, but when two teams play for the
top prize one often explodes. Any
body have some extra ducats? The
game shapes up as a solid sell-out
in the big-capacity Coliseum, which
should make Al Masters and Don
Liebendorfer very happy.
Perched on o bright red pad in the training room Saturday,
Coach Chuck Taylor, Stanford's all-winning coaching phenom,
easily grinned his way through some red-hot questions in an
after-the-victory interview.
"A prediction? Give me a little timo to think it over. Oh, heck!

Can't yet'oil tin- bandwagon now.
Not while we're winning. Sure,
well I jt-iit SC," is how the happy
headman of the red-hot Indians put
away the $(i4 question.
"We need lots of improvement
before SC. Yes, nl! the way around.
"But, we had a real passing test
today, and we held up pretty well
with the top combination of Horn.
Thompson, and Sanders in there.
Didn't we?
"That Southern Cal is a great
team. They're the tou hest team
defensively we'll meet. Gifford is
the cla>s of the coast us a runner.
Good movements. But we'll be as
well physically as possible against
Sl7. We will play our best game."
WSC: a Good Workout
He admitted that playing against
Washington State's single-wing of
fense was a good workout in prep
aration for the Trojans . Southern
California's formation is a little dif
ferent with most passing done from
a T. ''Yes, we had George Lynn
scouting the Army-SC game for us.
But he won't be able to learn much
from that game. We have them well
scouted from earlier games."
What did Chuck Taylor have to
say about Saturday's surprisingly
easy victory over what he had pre
dicted to be "the toughest game on
our schedulel'? "The defense, once
again, played a hell of a game.
Washington State was stopped for
the first time this season. And in a
convincing manner, too.
"The kids came up for the game
nicely. It was hard for us to get
going again after building up the
14-point lead. Didn't Gary do a nice
job of pulling them together and
sparking that third touchdown,
though?"
He explained the defense had
trouble getting adjusted to the
over-shifting on the first series, but
after that it was okay. Mixed up
the defense with a seven-man line
against the running and then later
a wide six against the Hurry of
parses.

ped over the Indian defender (Cas
telucci).
In tiie dressing room itself there
was none of the loud noise and hap
piness that would be expected after
a win in the season's crucial before
the crucial. Players went about
their chores in a business-like man
ner. There was .some back-slapping,
and the coach went about the room
talking to most of the players indi
vidually. He was glad when John
Brodtriek, big offensive tackle, ex
plained away his bad thigh as only
a charlie-hor.e.
Chuck Grins to All
The yells anil band music were
audible inside the gym and seemed
to be well appreciated. The players
chided Taylor when the crowd
broke into a "We want Chuck"
chant. The coach smiled and shook
his head. Then, after Yellman Tom
Randolph barged in and asked
Chuck if he'd come out, he did. He
stepped outside to the cheers, ac
cepted the student body's acclaim,
and ducked back inside with only a
big wave and grin.
Over across the court in the other
dressing room, the Cougars were
also quiet. Most agreed that they
had'lost to a better team. But many
felt that Stanford was in for a
rough afternoon against the swifl
and - rough Trojans. Guard Pete
Rademacher said that Stanford
wouldn't be able to hold Southern
Cal. And the giant tackle, the well
proportioned G-l't. 7-in. Howie Mc-
Cants, offered an "SC is a better
ball club."
Forrest Evashevski, the unsung
blocking back who cleared Tommy
Harmon's way to Michigan fame,
felt that his Washington State team
had played their worst game of the
season.
"I just don't know what Stan
ford's got. They're not a great ball
club. They get the job done, and
that's all."
Asked whether he thought the
final score was indicative of the
team difference, "Heck, no. They
could have beaten us even more.
Chuck used lots of reserves late in
the game."
Out of the predictions, comments,
and interviews, one thing sliopes up
for sure. That's the SC-Stanford
tilt should be a real pier - house
brawl with the game going either
way. According to some, Stanford
is tho strongest defensive ■ team on
the Coast. Chuck Taylor thinks the
Trojans are the toughest defensive
ly.
It could be a low-scoring, defen
sive battle. That's the way it should
be, but when two teams play for the
top prize one often explodes. Any
body have some extra ducats? The
game shapes up as a solid sell-out
in the big-capacity Coliseum, which
should make Al Masters and Don
Liebendorfer very happy.
Perched on o bright red pad in the training room Saturday,
Coach Chuck Taylor, Stanford's all-winning coaching phenom,
easily grinned his way through some red-hot questions in an
after-the-victory interview.
"A prediction? Give me a little timo to think it over. Oh, heck!

Can't yet'oil tin- bandwagon now.
Not while we're winning. Sure,
well I jt-iit SC," is how the happy
headman of the red-hot Indians put
away the $(i4 question.
"We need lots of improvement
before SC. Yes, nl! the way around.
"But, we had a real passing test
today, and we held up pretty well
with the top combination of Horn.
Thompson, and Sanders in there.
Didn't we?
"That Southern Cal is a great
team. They're the tou hest team
defensively we'll meet. Gifford is
the cla>s of the coast us a runner.
Good movements. But we'll be as
well physically as possible against
Sl7. We will play our best game."
WSC: a Good Workout
He admitted that playing against
Washington State's single-wing of
fense was a good workout in prep
aration for the Trojans . Southern
California's formation is a little dif
ferent with most passing done from
a T. ''Yes, we had George Lynn
scouting the Army-SC game for us.
But he won't be able to learn much
from that game. We have them well
scouted from earlier games."
What did Chuck Taylor have to
say about Saturday's surprisingly
easy victory over what he had pre
dicted to be "the toughest game on
our schedulel'? "The defense, once
again, played a hell of a game.
Washington State was stopped for
the first time this season. And in a
convincing manner, too.
"The kids came up for the game
nicely. It was hard for us to get
going again after building up the
14-point lead. Didn't Gary do a nice
job of pulling them together and
sparking that third touchdown,
though?"
He explained the defense had
trouble getting adjusted to the
over-shifting on the first series, but
after that it was okay. Mixed up
the defense with a seven-man line
against the running and then later
a wide six against the Hurry of
parses.
"We had a look at everybody this
time. Except for a couple on de
fense and four men on offense, we
cleared the bench. Funny, isn't it?
We couldn't even do that against
San Jose."
Card Reserves Played Well
Chuck liked the way some of the
übs played. Bobby Bryan ran well
and hard. He said that Bryan would
be used more, and the same for Skip
lyrist, the "hard - luck kid," who
played well on both offense an de
fense. It was the first varsity game
for several, including Wynn Wedge,
Mat Armitage. Dave Worley, Bob
Hoegh, and John Gilmorc.
About Washington State? "We
played 'em for runs instead of
passes. That's the way it worked
out. Sure, we had a couple of
scares later on when Burkhardt
started throwing against our re
serves. They were a tough team.
And, boy, how'd you like those
ends? You don't find much better
ends than that Barker. And that
other end (Stcinbi unnor) was a hell
of a blocker."
What did you think of Kerko
rian's play-calling? "Excellent. That
was All-America stuff out there. He
and McColl are great. McColl is
playing 100 per cent better than last
year. He's always there in the
clutches. And blocking like he nev
er had before."
Kunning Attack Needs Work
Not entirely pleased with the
running attack which can stand im
proving to stop the "sputtering,"
he cited Wes Laubseher and Bobby
Meyers, until his bad shoulder got
bumped, as turning in good per
formances.
Concerning what many thought
were "doubtful" calls, the headman
explained the unsportsmanlike con
due! call was against, Ron Eadie for
banging into the passer after Burk
hardt had thrown the ball. Eadie
wa already diving at the Cougar
quarter and was unable to stop his
motion. "He's not the kind of a boy
to pull any of that stuff."

And about the pas : interference,
he called it a "tough call," "What
do you think?" To mo t, it looked
like the Cougar end (Barker) trip
ped over the Indian defender (Cas
telucci).

way. According to some, Stanford
is tho strongest defensive ■ team on
the Coast. Chuck Taylor thinks the
Trojans are the toughest defensive
ly.
It could be a low-scoring, defen
sive battle. That's the way it should
be, but when two teams play for the
top prize one often explodes. Any
body have some extra ducats? The
game shapes up as a solid sell-out
in the big-capacity Coliseum, which
should make Al Masters and Don
Liebendorfer very happy.
Perched on o bright red pad in the training room Saturday,
Coach Chuck Taylor, Stanford's all-winning coaching phenom,
easily grinned his way through some red-hot questions in an
after-the-victory interview.
"A prediction? Give me a little timo to think it over. Oh, heck!

Can't yet'oil tin- bandwagon now.
Not while we're winning. Sure,
well I jt-iit SC," is how the happy
headman of the red-hot Indians put
away the $(i4 question.
"We need lots of improvement
before SC. Yes, nl! the way around.
"But, we had a real passing test
today, and we held up pretty well
with the top combination of Horn.
Thompson, and Sanders in there.
Didn't we?
"That Southern Cal is a great
team. They're the tou hest team
defensively we'll meet. Gifford is
the cla>s of the coast us a runner.
Good movements. But we'll be as
well physically as possible against
Sl7. We will play our best game."
WSC: a Good Workout
He admitted that playing against
Washington State's single-wing of
fense was a good workout in prep
aration for the Trojans . Southern
California's formation is a little dif
ferent with most passing done from
a T. ''Yes, we had George Lynn
scouting the Army-SC game for us.
But he won't be able to learn much
from that game. We have them well
scouted from earlier games."
What did Chuck Taylor have to
say about Saturday's surprisingly
easy victory over what he had pre
dicted to be "the toughest game on
our schedulel'? "The defense, once
again, played a hell of a game.
Washington State was stopped for
the first time this season. And in a
convincing manner, too.
"The kids came up for the game
nicely. It was hard for us to get
going again after building up the
14-point lead. Didn't Gary do a nice
job of pulling them together and
sparking that third touchdown,
though?"
He explained the defense had
trouble getting adjusted to the
over-shifting on the first series, but
after that it was okay. Mixed up
the defense with a seven-man line
against the running and then later
a wide six against the Hurry of
parses.
"We had a look at everybody this
time. Except for a couple on de
fense and four men on offense, we
cleared the bench. Funny, isn't it?
We couldn't even do that against
San Jose."
Card Reserves Played Well
Chuck liked the way some of the
übs played. Bobby Bryan ran well
and hard. He said that Bryan would
be used more, and the same for Skip
lyrist, the "hard - luck kid," who
played well on both offense an de
fense. It was the first varsity game
for several, including Wynn Wedge,
Mat Armitage. Dave Worley, Bob
Hoegh, and John Gilmorc.
About Washington State? "We
played 'em for runs instead of
passes. That's the way it worked
out. Sure, we had a couple of
scares later on when Burkhardt
started throwing against our re
serves. They were a tough team.
And, boy, how'd you like those
ends? You don't find much better
ends than that Barker. And that
other end (Stcinbi unnor) was a hell
of a blocker."
What did you think of Kerko
rian's play-calling? "Excellent. That
was All-America stuff out there. He
and McColl are great. McColl is
playing 100 per cent better than last
year. He's always there in the
clutches. And blocking like he nev
er had before."
Kunning Attack Needs Work
Not entirely pleased with the
running attack which can stand im
proving to stop the "sputtering,"
he cited Wes Laubseher and Bobby
Meyers, until his bad shoulder got
bumped, as turning in good per
formances.
Concerning what many thought
were "doubtful" calls, the headman
explained the unsportsmanlike con
due! call was against, Ron Eadie for
banging into the passer after Burk
hardt had thrown the ball. Eadie
wa already diving at the Cougar
quarter and was unable to stop his
motion. "He's not the kind of a boy
to pull any of that stuff."

And about the pas : interference,
he called it a "tough call," "What
do you think?" To mo t, it looked
like the Cougar end (Barker) trip
ped over the Indian defender (Cas
telucci).
In tiie dressing room itself there
was none of the loud noise and hap
piness that would be expected after
a win in the season's crucial before
the crucial. Players went about
their chores in a business-like man
ner. There was .some back-slapping,
and the coach went about the room
talking to most of the players indi
vidually. He was glad when John
Brodtriek, big offensive tackle, ex
plained away his bad thigh as only
a charlie-hor.e.
Chuck Grins to All
The yells anil band music were
audible inside the gym and seemed
to be well appreciated. The players
chided Taylor when the crowd
broke into a "We want Chuck"
chant. The coach smiled and shook
his head. Then, after Yellman Tom
Randolph barged in and asked
Chuck if he'd come out, he did. He
stepped outside to the cheers, ac
cepted the student body's acclaim,
and ducked back inside with only a
big wave and grin.
Over across the court in the other
dressing room, the Cougars were
also quiet. Most agreed that they
had'lost to a better team. But many
felt that Stanford was in for a
rough afternoon against the swifl
and - rough Trojans. Guard Pete
Rademacher said that Stanford
wouldn't be able to hold Southern
Cal. And the giant tackle, the well
proportioned G-l't. 7-in. Howie Mc-
Cants, offered an "SC is a better
ball club."
Forrest Evashevski, the unsung
blocking back who cleared Tommy
Harmon's way to Michigan fame,
felt that his Washington State team
had played their worst game of the
season.
"I just don't know what Stan
ford's got. They're not a great ball
club. They get the job done, and
that's all."
Asked whether he thought the
final score was indicative of the
team difference, "Heck, no. They
could have beaten us even more.
Chuck used lots of reserves late in
the game."
Out of the predictions, comments,
and interviews, one thing sliopes up
for sure. That's the SC-Stanford
tilt should be a real pier - house
brawl with the game going either
way. According to some, Stanford
is tho strongest defensive ■ team on
the Coast. Chuck Taylor thinks the
Trojans are the toughest defensive
ly.
