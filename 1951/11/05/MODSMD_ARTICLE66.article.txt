# Phi Psi Wins Crucial, 13-12
## 
### DICK CARTER 
In the featured game of Friday's
intramural program, the Phi Psi I
team downed the Kappa Sig I by'
one point, II)-12. Their win assured |
the unbeaten Phi Psi's of a play-off'
! berth even if they should 10-e to 1
j tell unbeaten but twice-tied SAB I j
j team next week, since two teams j
j from each fraternity league are al-j
j lowed in the final series.
The Phi Pii's received the open- j
I ing kick-off and promptly marched j
| downfield for a touchdown on short
i passes with practically invincible j
downfield blocking. 'I he conversion
! attempt failed. Near the end of the
! second quarter the Phi Psi'.s scored
j again on a repetition of their earlier I
; march. This time the try for the I
| all-important extra point was sue- I
c&ssful and the half ended with the
! score at 13-0.
Soon after the opening of the sec- l
j ond half it became apparent that
t.he Phi P.si's had lost their drive,
while the fighting Kappa Sig team
! came back with blood in their eyes.
Tii" Kappa Sigs scored in the third
! quarter after intercepting a pass on
I the enemy's 15 - yard line. With
I eight minutes to play, the Kappa
j Sigs began their only sustained I
| march of the day as they scored j
| their second touchdown. Their sec- j
onJ conversion attempt, like the \
first, was broken up by the hard
charging Phi Psi defensive line.
The outstanding players for the
victors were Wade McClusky,
whose passing and running sparked
j .'lie offense, and Dave Isbcll, who j
| threw crippling blocks and kept the |
j tight Phi Psi defense wound up.
' Sterling Clayton proved himself a |
! match for McClusky, as he ran and I
passed for both Kappa Sig scores. j
