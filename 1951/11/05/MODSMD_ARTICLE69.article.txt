# USC Displays Power In Clobbering Army
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Southern California, displaying
the same matchless pit ci:-ion that
marked the Army teams o( 1;)44,
'43, and '40, squashed a rim Utile
bund ol Cadets Saturday, UB-G.
It was tailback Frank (iifl'crd
who sloshed his wav through the
mud and snow for KiG "ards ru h
ing on 2X carrier for a t. aver
age. He completed four out of
eight passes for (1.1 yards, a t«;ti'l
ollense ma k of 21)! v;ud>.
The Trojan-.' oHenive line \va
awe-inspiring again. l l the Cadet .
It was almost impossible to get a
ieccnt footing, let alone throw If
l'\ olive blocks, in the 'mud that \va:
•he Yankee Stadium Held, yet the
Trojan linemen time and time again
opened gaping holes in the Army
line. John Conde, (JSC's left tackle,
was particularly impressive as he
alternately opened hole., in the line
and pulled out for the wide and
down - lield htuil. Guards Elmer
Willhoite and Al Sanbrano, and

! tackle Chuck Weeks, all on offense,
' were extremely effective.
On defense, Pat Canna m e 1 a
p.oved he was: not in the least bit
overrated. He had an uncanny abil- s
ity lor play-diagnosis, as proved by j
the fact that he was there to break !
up three c. 1 the eight passes the
Cadets threw and shot the yap con
tinually, once to spill Cadet Bob
Vann lor a nine-yard lo.ss belore the
i piav -jven got started.
Defensive end Dill Haiti*; and
linebackers Jim Kiddle and
j e Koranic Were all similari> j
impressive. It was easy to see
wliv SC has the best rushing ile
| fense on the Coast.
