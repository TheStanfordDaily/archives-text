CAIRO, Egypt, Nov. sâ€”Egyptian
terrorists machinegunned a British
motor car today in one of six inci
dents of violence which erupted in
the: Suez Canal Zone as Cairo news
papers announced the opening of an
underground "war" designed to
drive the British from the disputed
area.
Interior Minister Fuad Sirag El
Din Pasha said at a press conference
tonight that the Anglo - Egyptian
dispute was getting worse steadily.
He said that in the present circum
stances passive resistance to the
British occupation of Suez was
"better" than open warfare.
