# Seventy-Four Running For Campus Positions
## Primary Elections Tomorrow; Fourteen Booths Will Be Open 
### 
Seventy-three candidates are entered in the race for twelve
student government offices—which will begin officially tomorrow
morning at 8:30 when the first voting booths will open on campus.
This, the primary election, will determine two things: first, the
four persons, two men and two women, who will fill the two

vacancies on Men's and Women's
Councils; second, who is to appear
on the final ballot next Wednesday
for the remaining eight offices.
In an effort to get a larger turn
out for the voting tomorrow, the

mitter will set 11 p more voting
