# New Liquor Law Dramatized
## 
### 
The new California liquor law was drama
tized for all to see last week with the conviction
of a 19-year-old sophomore because he pur
chased two bottles of hard liquor. The soph was
fined SlOO and put on six months probation.
The fine indicates that the new law, designed
to be stiffer than previous liquor laws concern
ing minors, will be strictly enforced.
As far as the University is concerned, Chief
Counselor for Men Richard Balch said yester
day that violations of the liquor law would be
treated like any other violations committed by
students. Problems of this sort that involve
male sudents at the University are problems
that involve Mens' Council as well as the

Dean's Office. Action by the University fol
lows Council action.
Balch said a statement in yesterday's Daily
that "harsh disciplinary action (by the school)
can be expected to follow future liquor viola
tions" was not necessarily correct. "Liquor
violations will be treated on an individual basis
just like ail disciplinary action," he said. *
For that matter the whole business of liquor
boils down to an individual problem, anyway.
Once the facts of the law are known no amount
of preaching will accomplish anything. A stiff
penalty like that meted out last week does serve
as a jolt to anyone inclined toward complac
ency, however.
