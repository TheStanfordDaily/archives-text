STANFORD SPIRIT
Some people are too blase for the Stanford Spirit.
Many read about it in the Frosh Bible and never know
what it really is until they've graduated.
The cliche about Stanford Spirit is "that it is some
thing that you can't quite put your finger on." I
submit that it is something that you can put your
finger on. One only has to know the players on the
football team and the coaching staff to know that the
Stanford Spirit is something very real.

Hear the evidence: Dick Horn
and Gary Kerkorian were both
outstanding prep quarterbacks in
Southern California. Horn, how
ever, reaped more honors and was
more highly sought by the colleges
than Kerkorian. But when they
came to Stanford, Kerkorian de
veloped faster than Horn and won
the number one signal-calling po
sition.
This doesn't mean that Horn is

a slouch at quarter backing a team. He would be first
string quarterback at any other outfit on the coast.
But it was apparent that he wasn't going to see much
action behind a man of Kerkorian's calibre, and so he
was switched to defense. Now, a defensive halfback
doesn't get any headlines. Those are reserved for the
quarterback who throws touchdown passes and en
gineers scoring drives. In nine out of ten cases such
as this, there is naturally deep resentment on the part
of the man who has been switched.

Dick Horn, however, not only resigned himself
(o being a defensive half, hut became one of the
ablest defenders in the conference. He and Kerkor
ian are the best of friends and often give each other
advice on their respective phases of the game.
Horn is just as important to the team in his capacity
as Kerkorian is in his, and being the only veteran in
the defensive backfield, has "fathered" and assisted
the rest in becoming the best defending backfield unit
in the league. Remember that it was a terribly difficult
transition to make. Did I hear someone say you
couldn't "put your finger on that Stanford Spirit?"
Take the case of Bob Meyers. The handsome back
didn't play in the Washington game, partly because
he was recovering from an injury, partly because Bob
Mathias was doing so well.
After the game, trainer Connie Jarvis remarked
to Meyers that it was too bad he didn't get in. "Heck,"
laughed Meyers, "why use a cap gun when you've got
a torpedo out there?"
The comparison doesn't hold water. The modest
Meyers, who has averaged near five yards a crack,
is certainly more explosive than a cap gun. But he
knew that it was just Mathias's day.and that the
decathalon champ was doing the team more good than
he could have.
It was just a little thing, but the Stanford Spirit is
exemplified by a lot of little things.
This Saturday, Stanford meets Southern California
in the game of the year. It is my sincere conviction
that Stanford is going to win that game. And not
among the least of the reasons for my conviction is
the Stanford Spirit.

couldn't "put your finger on that Stanford Spirit?"
Take the case of Bob Meyers. The handsome back
didn't play in the Washington game, partly because
he was recovering from an injury, partly because Bob
Mathias was doing so well.
After the game, trainer Connie Jarvis remarked
to Meyers that it was too bad he didn't get in. "Heck,"
laughed Meyers, "why use a cap gun when you've got
a torpedo out there?"
The comparison doesn't hold water. The modest
Meyers, who has averaged near five yards a crack,
is certainly more explosive than a cap gun. But he
knew that it was just Mathias's day.and that the
decathalon champ was doing the team more good than
he could have.
It was just a little thing, but the Stanford Spirit is
exemplified by a lot of little things.
This Saturday, Stanford meets Southern California
in the game of the year. It is my sincere conviction
that Stanford is going to win that game. And not
among the least of the reasons for my conviction is
the Stanford Spirit.

STANFORD SPIRIT
Some people are too blase for the Stanford Spirit.
Many read about it in the Frosh Bible and never know
what it really is until they've graduated.
The cliche about Stanford Spirit is "that it is some
thing that you can't quite put your finger on." I
submit that it is something that you can put your
finger on. One only has to know the players on the
football team and the coaching staff to know that the
Stanford Spirit is something very real.

Hear the evidence: Dick Horn
and Gary Kerkorian were both
outstanding prep quarterbacks in
Southern California. Horn, how
ever, reaped more honors and was
more highly sought by the colleges
than Kerkorian. But when they
came to Stanford, Kerkorian de
veloped faster than Horn and won
the number one signal-calling po
sition.
This doesn't mean that Horn is

a slouch at quarter backing a team. He would be first
string quarterback at any other outfit on the coast.
But it was apparent that he wasn't going to see much
action behind a man of Kerkorian's calibre, and so he
was switched to defense. Now, a defensive halfback
doesn't get any headlines. Those are reserved for the
quarterback who throws touchdown passes and en
gineers scoring drives. In nine out of ten cases such
as this, there is naturally deep resentment on the part
of the man who has been switched.

Dick Horn, however, not only resigned himself
(o being a defensive half, hut became one of the
ablest defenders in the conference. He and Kerkor
ian are the best of friends and often give each other
advice on their respective phases of the game.
Horn is just as important to the team in his capacity
as Kerkorian is in his, and being the only veteran in
the defensive backfield, has "fathered" and assisted
the rest in becoming the best defending backfield unit
in the league. Remember that it was a terribly difficult
transition to make. Did I hear someone say you
couldn't "put your finger on that Stanford Spirit?"
