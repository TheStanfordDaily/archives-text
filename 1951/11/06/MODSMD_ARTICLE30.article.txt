## For Keeping the Language Reqirement 
### 
To the Editor:
Please permit me to add my comment on the silly
proposal to lessen the formal language requirement.
Alter four years of teaching experience in the linguistic
field at another university, I believe I know the salient
points on which the debate hinges and the protests
concentrate.
No matter what the method used, the beginning
phases ol language study are bound to involve memor
ization, repetition, and an occupation with funda
mentals. Demands for an elimination of grammar and
formal training reflect only ignorance of the subject,
for the very skeleton of any language consists in the
modification, use, and order of words, and it is pre
cisely that subject with which grammatical rules and
lists of idioms deal. Under present conditions it is
impossible to learn a foreign language by merely hear
ing and speaking it. for one would have to use that
language for all of one's waking hours for perhaps
as long as a year for any success along those lines,
and even then one would make innumerable mistakes.
A frequent complaint is that the material used in
beginning language classes is tedious and boring. But
the plaintiffs forget that they want to speak the new
tongue immediately at an advanced level, which is
impossible. A freshman entering a German or French
class has to catch up with about eighteen years of
speaking German or French, and he is not going to
do that in one quarter. Therefore he must use texts
that seem to him quite childish, for in the new language
he is an infant.
I am in favor of the language requirement, for the

reason of the prodigious cultural values involved.
First of all. I found that my students usually did not
know English any too well, and by using the com
parative method, I was able to teach them many new
words and finer points of grammar. Some who came
from "progressive" schools would not know any gram
mar at all and picked up all ability to use English
effectively and precisely in their fulfillment of the
foreign language requirement. This is an important
function which language teachers usually hate but
.still fulfill.
Secondly, there are many works of importance in
the belles lettres, scientific works, and periodical press
of other countries which are not translated or badly
rendered into English, and which will help the student
later on.
But most important of all, the acquisition of a new
language is the key to an entirely new cultural world,
to concepts and artistic enjoyments not encountered in
one's native tongue, to new perspectives and new
vistas as well as much old wisdom placed in a new
light.
It is my firm conviction that the opponents of the
language program have either not yet completed theirs
with success or otherwise devoted so little time to it
and studied with so little sincerity that they have
failed to see the truth. I am sure that if by earnest
application and sincere devotion they reach the point
of reading the foreign tongue with some facility, they
will agree with me and will thank this University for
having enriched their lives.
