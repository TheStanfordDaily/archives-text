### 
By WALT MENNINGER |
Cellar coffee is still a nickel, |
but students at the University of '
Hawaii can't say the same for
their brew. For the first time this i
year, inflation hit the nickel cup
of coffee, reports the Ka Leo O
Hawaii, publication at the Uni-1
versity of Hawaii.
Along v.'ith the rise in the price
of coffee to a dime a cup, Hawaiian
students must pay five cents more
for sandwiches, floats, milkshakes,
sodas, and malts, and two cents
more for cigarettes.

Women lead an interesting life at
the Illinois Institute of Technology.
The Technology News tells us that
"a duo of inspired frosh women,
successfully carrying out a parody j
of instructors, calmly sat in class
exuding voluminous clouds of
smoke from two ancient but dur
able pipes."
The affair was instigated when a
math instructor denied fellows in
his class the privilege of smoking
while allowing any girls who want
ed to the right to smoke a pipe.
Concluded the News, "The girls,
vowing never to smoke again, com
mented that they had never tasted
anything quite? so bitter."

Editorializes the Washington
State College Daily Evergreen,
the WSC band "has been ail but
parentless for several years now,
and although everyone wants the
band to perform at games, go on
trips to advertise the school, and
promote good - will throughout
the .state, no one seems to take the
cost of such activities into consid
eration."
' The Evergreen offers the solu
tion of giving the band a budget
of its own, so that it doesn't have
to "g ( > begging" for funds.

that they were squelched without

Several universities have been
having library troubles.
Alter a long campaign, .students
at the University of Washington got
the university authorities to open
the library on Saturdays from 9 to
5, according to the University of
Washington Daily.
Yale students are now able to
study straight through until mid
night, instead of having the library
close at 10. The extension of the
library hours for the Elis was made
after a crusade by the Yale News,
student newspaper.
On top of these library exten
sions, the University of Michigan
decided to set aside funds necessary
to open its library on Sundays. Says
the Michigan Daily, "The move (by
the university) brought to at least
a temporary conclusion one of the
most heated controversies in recent
campus history."
