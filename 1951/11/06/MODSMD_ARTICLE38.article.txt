# PRO AND CAHN

### 
'I lie HOW BOYS shoot the works this Saturday against the USC Tro
jans. And when the dust of the Coliseum settles, the Pacific Coast Con
ference Rose Howl representative will have virtually been decided.
Th eyes ol the Nation will be focused on the Los Angeles bowl where over
105,000 lucky ticket holders will witness the goings on. The importance of
the titanic is questioned by no one; the outcome is questioned by all.
But in our way of thinking, and as we stated several weeks back, the
Trojan struggle will not be as rough a hurdle as the Washington contest.
For it was in the Husky game that the HOW BOYS jelled. And it was the
Washington State game that gave them complete poise and a silent con
fidence.
The Indians have gone from week to week winning by the margin neces
sary, apparently never seriously pressed. And if pressed, the defense rose
to the occasion, stopped the enemy, and the offense picked up the needed
score almost at will. It has looked so easy that some still maintain that
Stanford has not been tested. If Michigan, which is doing all right in the
Big Ten, and UCLA, who upset Cal. and the dangerous though overrated
Washington, and offense minded WSC aren't tests then we wouldn't want
such thinking individuals making up any exams for us.
The HOW BOYS have met every test, and passed every test with flying
colors. There is no reason for them to tail now. They are yet to show every
thing they have, but they are ready and willing when the situation de
mands.
We can't list the reasons in order why Stanford should win Saturday;
perhaps we don t know th'em, perhaps they are too numerous. But to us
the 11)51 Stanford varsity is an aggregation of ball players that won't let
themselves get beaten. We look, perhaps on intuition alone, for the HOW
BOYS to beat USC. The margin, why about three touchdowns to one.
COULD BE STANFORD'S HOMECOMING
Although the tilt marks USC homecoming game, it might as well be
the Stanlord varsity homecoming, especially for the offensive platoon.
Gut ol the eleven starters, ten are from the Immediate Los Angeles vicinity.
Only Bob Mathias will be playing away from home—so to speak. The de
fense also has more than a few men who will be familiar with the surround
ings.
We liked the spirit and confidence Chuck Taylor showed at one point
Saturday. Early-in the going, with fourth and one at about midfield, Ker
korian looked to the .bench for a word of advice. Being a bit of a gambler,
oi- perhaps confident of a sure thing, Chuck with a glorious swing of arm
and fist, indicated to try for the first down instead of punting. Harry Hu
gasian made it with 3 yards to spare.
PRAISE WHERE PRAISE IS DUE
Rally Committee, after a six week stupor, has finally arisen from the hack
of its' collective lap and is actually doing things about generating Stanford
spirit. Rally Com has planned a short sendoff rally tomorrow night. It
seems to us that it has done its job, and it is now up to the Student Body
lt» curry on.
We currently hear talk about how good Oregon State is, following their
40-14 rout of Washington last week. But let it be known that the Huskies
were only physically, not mentally the same team that faced the Indians.
They were flatter than champaign left open over night, What's more it is
rumored that the team is torn with dissension. Seems some of the players
didn't like the idea of Don Heinrich, though physically able, not playing the
remaining games, but rather being saved for possible better things come
1952. And it also seems that some of the boys don't have too much con
fidence in the coaching staff which has promised wins that couldn't be
gotten. It was one disgusted gridder, who after the Stanford game was
heard to say "And these were the guys they said we would beat by forty
points."
A word to the wise is sufficient. In driving to and from the SC game on
crowded highways and in speedway Los Angeles, take it easy. We all want
to go back for the Rose Bowl.

fidence.
The Indians have gone from week to week winning by the margin neces
sary, apparently never seriously pressed. And if pressed, the defense rose
to the occasion, stopped the enemy, and the offense picked up the needed
score almost at will. It has looked so easy that some still maintain that
Stanford has not been tested. If Michigan, which is doing all right in the
Big Ten, and UCLA, who upset Cal. and the dangerous though overrated
Washington, and offense minded WSC aren't tests then we wouldn't want
such thinking individuals making up any exams for us.
The HOW BOYS have met every test, and passed every test with flying
colors. There is no reason for them to tail now. They are yet to show every
thing they have, but they are ready and willing when the situation de
mands.
We can't list the reasons in order why Stanford should win Saturday;
perhaps we don t know th'em, perhaps they are too numerous. But to us
the 11)51 Stanford varsity is an aggregation of ball players that won't let
themselves get beaten. We look, perhaps on intuition alone, for the HOW
BOYS to beat USC. The margin, why about three touchdowns to one.
COULD BE STANFORD'S HOMECOMING
Although the tilt marks USC homecoming game, it might as well be
the Stanlord varsity homecoming, especially for the offensive platoon.
Gut ol the eleven starters, ten are from the Immediate Los Angeles vicinity.
Only Bob Mathias will be playing away from home—so to speak. The de
fense also has more than a few men who will be familiar with the surround
ings.
We liked the spirit and confidence Chuck Taylor showed at one point
Saturday. Early-in the going, with fourth and one at about midfield, Ker
korian looked to the .bench for a word of advice. Being a bit of a gambler,
oi- perhaps confident of a sure thing, Chuck with a glorious swing of arm
and fist, indicated to try for the first down instead of punting. Harry Hu
gasian made it with 3 yards to spare.
PRAISE WHERE PRAISE IS DUE
Rally Committee, after a six week stupor, has finally arisen from the hack
of its' collective lap and is actually doing things about generating Stanford
spirit. Rally Com has planned a short sendoff rally tomorrow night. It
seems to us that it has done its job, and it is now up to the Student Body
lt» curry on.
We currently hear talk about how good Oregon State is, following their
40-14 rout of Washington last week. But let it be known that the Huskies
were only physically, not mentally the same team that faced the Indians.
They were flatter than champaign left open over night, What's more it is
rumored that the team is torn with dissension. Seems some of the players
didn't like the idea of Don Heinrich, though physically able, not playing the
remaining games, but rather being saved for possible better things come
1952. And it also seems that some of the boys don't have too much con
fidence in the coaching staff which has promised wins that couldn't be
gotten. It was one disgusted gridder, who after the Stanford game was
heard to say "And these were the guys they said we would beat by forty
points."
A word to the wise is sufficient. In driving to and from the SC game on
crowded highways and in speedway Los Angeles, take it easy. We all want
to go back for the Rose Bowl.
'I lie HOW BOYS shoot the works this Saturday against the USC Tro
jans. And when the dust of the Coliseum settles, the Pacific Coast Con
ference Rose Howl representative will have virtually been decided.
Th eyes ol the Nation will be focused on the Los Angeles bowl where over
105,000 lucky ticket holders will witness the goings on. The importance of
the titanic is questioned by no one; the outcome is questioned by all.
But in our way of thinking, and as we stated several weeks back, the
Trojan struggle will not be as rough a hurdle as the Washington contest.
For it was in the Husky game that the HOW BOYS jelled. And it was the
Washington State game that gave them complete poise and a silent con
fidence.
