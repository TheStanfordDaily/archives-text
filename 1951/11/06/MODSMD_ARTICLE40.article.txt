# Cards In Good Shape
## 
### EARL ODELL 
The undefeated Indians, with
seven scalps in their belts, will be
knocking at the door to the Rose
Bowl this weekend when they tan
gle with USC in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. The Trojans at the mo
ment hold the key to that tloor, but
the Cards might have what it takes
to get it away.
Last night, the Indians were
handed some new plays out of
Chuck Taylor's bag of tricks, and as
they ran through the drills they
were confident and "high" for the
game Saturday.
Good news from the Indian camp
came from trainer Connie Jarvis,
who reported that all injuries in
curred against Washington State

last Saturday are minor, and ev
eryone will be ready for the Tro
jans. One sour note was found in
the fact that halfback Eric South
wood, injured against Santa Clara
a few weeks ago, will probably not
be ready for USC. Linebacker
Chuck Essegian, who played a tre
mendous game against the Cougars,
was the most serious injury with a
bruised rib, but, according to Jar
vis, he'll be padded and ready.
The defensive unit last night
heard a scout report on USC by
backfield coach George Lynn and a
warning by Taylor that Trojan tail
back Frank Gifford, Southern Cal's
great break-away runner, will be
the man to watch closely Saturday.
