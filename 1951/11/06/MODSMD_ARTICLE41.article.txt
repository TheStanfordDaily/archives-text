# Encina 2E Wins Fourth Straight
## 
### 
Encina 2E's unbeaten touch foot
ball aggregation rolled on to their
fourth straight intramural victory
yesterday afternoon by defeating a
stubborn Encina 5E squad, 7-0. It
was a combination of good defen
sive line play and a couple of
sticky-fingered pass receivers which
enabled the Encinamen to eke out
the narrow win which could lead
to the league title.
Midway in the first half 2E scored
when tailback A 1 Brouse hit end
John Griffin in the end zone for
.30 yards and a TD. This was the

climax of a series of sustained
drives by 2E which had fizzled out
deep in 5E territory. A conversion
pass play from Brouse to halfback
Chuck Burke was good and the 22
men led 7-0, a score which was des
tined to remain the margin of vic
tory.
Near the close of the first half,
5E was able to push over a score
which, however, was called buck by
the referee because of the claim by
2E that he had blown the whistle
before the play was completed.
As a result of yesterday's game,
2E will meet Toyon Chez for the
frosh league championship later in
the week. Chez continued unbeaten
yesterday by accepting a forfeit
from Encina 3E.
