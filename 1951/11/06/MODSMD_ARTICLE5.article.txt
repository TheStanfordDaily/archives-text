# Big A-Bomb Blows

### 
LAS VEGAS, Ncv. â€”An atomic
bomb which rattled windows 225
miles away and may have been the
strongest exploded thus far in this
country provided two Nevada towns
with an impromptu test of reaction
to emergency conditions today.
The bomb lit the daylight sky
with a flash more brilliant than any
of its four immediate predecessors
and its rumble was the longest and
loudest yet heard by observers in
the vicinity of the test site.
