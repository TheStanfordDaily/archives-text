# Taylor Picks Stanford Over Trojans; Fears Gifford More Than Cannamela
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 (UP)—
Pat Cannamela of Southern Califor
nia is "just another linebacker" to
the Stanford club. Coach Chuck
Taylor of the Indians said today.
"We've met and seen a lot of line
backers just as good as Cannamela,"
said Taylor today about the Trojan
star who just two weeks ago
wrecked California. "To us he is
just another linebacker."
"Our real fear lies in tailback
Frank Gilford. I believe he is one
of the greatest backs in the coun
try."
Thus the youthful coach of the

surprising "How do they do it?"
boys helped set the stage for the
season's greatest clash in Los An
geles Saturday.
This is the bout that will in all
probability settle the Pacific Coast
Conference championship and at the
same time send the winner to the
Rose Bowl to meet the Big Ten rep
resentative (Illinois?).
Taylor, who picks his boys to win
—as he has done in seven straight
games this year—backed down on a
statement of a week ago in which he
predicted that Washington State
would be tougher than either USC

or California.
"I was worried about the Wash
ington State aerial attack," he said.
"But now I realize that Southern
California will be better."
'"We won't have any trouble yet
ting the boys up' for this one," he
said. "Ten out of our 11 starters
are from the Los Angeles area. My
only hope is that they aren't over
anxious when they appear before
the home folks.
"1 know that Southern California
has a very fine team and will be
awfully tough to beat. Hut I think
we can do it."
