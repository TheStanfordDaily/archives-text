# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## M.E.'s AT DU PONT [2] 
### 
Challenging variety of problems solved
by research and development engineers

As a student of mechanical engineer
ing, do you look forward to a future
in research, development, plant en
gineering or production supervision?
In the Digest this month, we'd like
to discuss the ample outlet Du Pont
offers your talents in these fields.
Let's talk about research and de
velopment together because t hey often
overlap indistinguishably. Both these
fields deal with mechanisms for mak
ing products. In some cases, original
equipment is designed for a new prod
uct. In others, machinery used in mak
ing existing products is improved to
provide better quality at lower cost.
This design and development work
may call for»studies of the vibration of

machine elements, equipment, struc
tural members and structures. Or there
. may be need for application of elec
tronics, instrumentation, operation of
test equipment and testing of experi
mental machines. In much of this ac
tivity there is close cooperation with
other engineers, participation in group
conferences, joint analysis of data,
and issuance of recommendations.
Du Pont research and development
engineers keep informed of develop
ments through technical, trade and
patent literature, seminars and lec
tures. Exceptional facilities for these
are provided.
Here are some examples, specific
and general, of the problems that con
front Du Pont research and develop
ment engineers:
1. Develop and design high-speed slit
ting equipment for thin films. In
volved are unwind and wind-up ten
sion regulation, alignment of web
travel and cutting-knife selection,
combined in a machine easy to service.
1. Design equipment to operate at
pressures up to 45,000 p.s.i. This is
insurance against the time when proc
esses may be developed that will op
erate in this range.
As pressures are increased, design
problems for moderate pressures are
magnified. Typical are stress-fatigue
of metals, design of vessel closures
and line joints, valves and packing for
reciprocating compressors and centrif
ugal pumps, packing glands forstirred
autoclaves, etc.
3. Design, installation and testing of
large air-conditioning systems neces
sary in the manufacture of certain
products. In one plant, water is used
at the rate of 50 million gallonM daily,
current at 25,000 kw. per hour, and
air at 5.5 million C.F.M.
These three examples, selected from

literally hundreds, can only hint at the
breadth and variety of the problems that
are constantly arising.
One of the strongest pieces of evidence
that mechanical engineering is of major
significance in the Du Pont Company is
the existence of the Wilmington Shops.
They represent an investment of over
$3,500,000 and cover an area of 300,000
sq. ft., including a foundry and pattern
shop. They employ over 800 men and
have a potential output in volume of
work in excess of $6,000,000 a year.
The size and diversity of this operation
are justified only because the work of
mechanical engineers is an important
factor in Du Pont operations.
NEXT MONTH—Opportunities in plant en
gineering and product supervision will he
discussed in the third article in this series,
"M.E.'s at Du Pont." Watch for i,t!
Send for your copy of "The Du Pont Company
and the College Graduate." Describes oppor
tunities for men and women with many types
of training. Address: 2521 Nemours Building,
Wilmington, Delaware.
