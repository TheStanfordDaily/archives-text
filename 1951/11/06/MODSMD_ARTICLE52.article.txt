# Mazour Says Temporary Peace Now Goal of Realistic Russians
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Items have appeared recently
in tht> Russian press calling
upon East and West to settle
their outstanding differences.
That such items are straws in the
wind indicating that the Soviets
are ready to talk peace is the
opinion of Dr. Anatole G. Ma
zour, associate professor of his
tory at Stanford.
An expert in Russian history, Dr.
Mazour discussed trends in Soviet
foreign policy and the methods for
combatting Communism in an in
terview yesterday. He said the So
viets desire to talk peace not be
cause they are pacifists ,but because
they are realists. They realize that
they cannot win in an open conflict
at this time.
Dr. Mazour, who was born in
Russia and who fought in the Rus
sian Civil War, said the West should
not miss the opportunity to nego
tiate peace, even if only for a lim
ited period. If such a peace should
come about, the West should
strengthen itself, not militarily, but
morally and politically. The West
should make democracy a real and
living thing.
Liberty Not Force
'"The future of the world depends
upon the example of the West. The
magnet of democracy is democracy
itself. But democracy must be based
on justice and liberty and not sheer
force. If democracy can create a
great enough attraction, no one can
tell what will happen at the end of
the period of peace," he said.
The success of Communism will
depend in large part upon the poli
cies of the West, he continued. The
more effectively democracy works,
the less effectively Communism
works. A great deal of the success
of the West will depend upon its
wisdom in the Orient.
"Asia can no longer be regarded
with nineteenth century attitudes.
Intelligence is required in the mat
ter and America must stop backing
old horses of pre-historic days. We
must take the initiative to try new
ideas and not be afraid to face the

new forces in Asia."
Equality
Continuing, Dr. Mazour said the
West taught Asia about democracy,
but when Asiatics started applying
it, the West got frightened. "Amer
ica must learn to get along with the
world and approach people on a
basis of equality—not only in Asia,
but also at home. America must
get over the legacy of second-class
democracy for home consumption."
When asked about the chances of
success of a high-level talk with the
Soviets as proposed by Churchill,
Dr. Mazour said the Conservatives
are visually more successful in deal
ing with Russia than the Laborites.
That is partly due to the fact that
when the Russians deal with the
Conservatives, they deal with them
as such, whereas when they deal
with the Laborites, they look upon
them as renegades.
Parenthetically, Dr. Mazour also
remarked on the lack of wisdom in
the recent White House statement
that agreements with Russia are not.
worth the paper they are written on.
He said that for a statement, like
that to be made at a time when
Ambassador Kirk was having talks
with Stalin shows a "muddled pol
icy."
Machinery Set Up
On the subject of a likely succes
sor to Stalin, Dr. Mazour said it does
not greatly matter who succeeds
him, for the machinery is there.
Any hope of a change in Russian
attitudes after Stalih is mere wish
ful thinking.
In concluding the interview, Dr.
Mazour called for more level-head
ed ness and less panic in the present
crisis. He pointed to the last two
issues of Collier's as an example of
irresponsible journalism and panic
at its worst. "Unfortunately some
eminent students of history contrib
uted to that journalistic folly," he

said. "If I were the Soviet Minister
of Propaganda, I'd translate that
into every language and distribute
it in millions. It would be the best
anti-American propaganda there is."
