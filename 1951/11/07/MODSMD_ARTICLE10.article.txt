### 
Elizabeth Bowen answered two of
the main questions of young writers
in an inspiring lecture last night to
a capacity Tuesday Evening Series
audience. These two queries are:
"Have not all experiences and
emotions already been exhausted in
writing?" "Isn't there too much to
sayâ€”more than can be pinned down
and crystallized?"
"Without the reflection of our age
in art, human experience would be
incomplete," she said.
In answering the second question,
Miss Bowen said, "The whole core
of the story is selectiveness. The
writer must simplify his story

the general experiences of man
kind."
"No book is truly completed until

said. "The creative side is the hard
process, but another creative pro

reader."
Concluding, the Irish-English au

The threats against writing are
more superficial and less threaten
ing than they appear.
"The writer is aware of the need
of co-operation and understanding
from the reader. With this, there is
great promise and importance in the
position of our writers today."
