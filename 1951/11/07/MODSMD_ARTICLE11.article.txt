# Judicial Council Suspends Student
## 
### 
The Council for Student Control
recommended one quarter's suspen
sion for a student who violated the
Honor Code by copying a weekly
paper in an English course. He is
also to receive an automatic "F" in
the course.
The paper, which was supposed to
have been original, had been copied
from a book.
Another student, accused of
cheating in a multiple-choice test.,
had his ease dismissed.
Ihe Council wants to stress the
fact that the Honor Code applies
not only to tests, but also to themes,
lab reports, daily exercises, and any
other work that is used as a basis
for grading.
