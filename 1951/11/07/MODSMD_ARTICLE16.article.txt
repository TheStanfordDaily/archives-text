I have become sincerely interest
ed in Women's Council through my

experience as Council representa- J
tive from my living group, and 1
think there would be fewer viola
tions if the rules were clearly ex
plained. 1 feel I have the under- j
tanding, interest, and time to do the j
work well, and I'd appreciate your j
vot.es.
