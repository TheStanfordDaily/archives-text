The Council maintains privileges |
and standards for women and works
toward simplifying social regula- i
tions. Constant and close contact i
between the Council and Stanford
women is one of my aims. Having
lived in two dorms and one How
house, I feel I know the individual
problems of each type of living
group â€” especially those difficulties
not apparent on the surface.
