FOR SURPLUS DIVIDENDSâ€”Rebates, that is. More than 700 students braved the line at the Book
store yesterday to pick up 55.000 of the extra rebate money. Payments will continue until all
students have claimed their additional seven and a half per cent dividend on last year's purchases.
The business office is open from 9to 11 a.m. and 2to 4 p.m. to make the payments.
