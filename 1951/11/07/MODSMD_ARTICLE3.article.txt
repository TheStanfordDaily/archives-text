# Reach Low Ebb In Korean Talks
## 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Nov. 7 (UP)
-Prospects for ending the Korean [
war reached their lowest ebb today '
as Allied and Communist negotia
tors met at Panmunjom for the 14th !
time.
Communists' rejection of an Al- j
lied plan to work out a full Korean |
armistice agreement before the
shooting stops plunged the talks
toward their w%rst deadlock and it
was doubted the Reds would change
their minds today.
The Reds failed to give a final
"no" and promised to study the UN
proposal further. The feeling at the
Allied camp in Munsan was that
there was little chance of averting a
deepening deadlock, since the Reds
by stalling on this item could build
up their war position.
