# It's Important to Vote Today
## 
### 
Today is V-Day on campus—V for Voting.
And that means it's your privilege to cast a
ballot for the persons you want in office.
The primary election today will determine
two things: first, the two men and two women
who will fill the vacancies on Men's and Wom
en's Council; second, the candidates whose
names will appear on the final ballot next week,
for the eight other offices.
Members of Men's and Women's Council,
Excom representatives, and class officers are
persons who directly deal with activities and
problems which affect you. Students who win
the primaries today and come out on top after

the final balloting next week will be twelve
persons in responsible positions. During the
year they'll vote and act on literally hundreds
of things important to you.
Every quarter, grumblings are sometimes
overheard on campus about, "Why doesn't he
do something in office?" or "That was a stupid
policy for him to vote for." Well, today's your
chance to help select the persons whom you
believe most capable for the jobs.
So bring your student body card with you on
Quad today and vote. Don't waste your oppor
tunity to help select the students who will rep
resent you.—H.K.
