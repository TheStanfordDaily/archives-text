FOOTBALL AND THE COLLEGI

Football is a great game. Don't let anybody tell you
differently. Recently in the press, magazines, and
motion pictures football has been the much-gnawed
on bone of contention. Charges of commercialism and
dirty play have become front page features and eye
arresting bill boards. It's hard to pick up a magazine
without finding some article like "The Football Rack
et" or "Are the Gamblers Buying Football?" In short:
it is the fad to climb on the great bandwagon and
knock the college sport.

There is no denying that com
mercialism and dirty play does
exist. It can he found in many
places throughout the country.
But does this mean that college
football everywhere is rotten
and corrupt? Does it mean that
football players in general are a
bunch of bums out mauling
other bums for a few dollars?
if you read some of the maga
zine stories and see pictures like

"Saturday's Hero," you might wonder.
Many of the critics of football abuses are genuinely
friends ot the game. They are doing their honest best
to preserve our sport as it should be. But a goodly
number of the pack of "football critics" are in reality
committing the crime that they pretend to abhorâ€”they

are turning an honest controversy into commercialism.
They are making a fast, insincere dollar out of leaping
on a valid theme and bleeding it white. The danger
of these wolves is that they distort reality in the sheer
volume of their tripe. The other danger of these band
wagoneers is that people who don't know college, and
college spirit, and football believe the tales they read.
Those who try to tell you that college football players
play for money don't know too much about-the game.
Football is much more than just a big, or fast, or
polished team. There is some reason why weaker
teams rise up against all odds and logical prediction
to defeat a much stronger opponent. There is some
reasort why men keep playing even when they're
bruised and exhausted. There's some reason why un
derdogs win. It's called spirit. And that you can't buy.
As war is to ihe nation, football is to the college.
At no time are we more united than when we sit
seven thousand strong in the rooting section and yell
and worry as one for our team. This spirit of com
radeship is a fine thing. It makes the whole university
experience more meaningful. When the college days
are done, it is this intangible something that hinds
lis all so fast to Stanford. And a big part of all of this
is football.
In talent and power we can match any team on the
Pacific Coast. But in spirit and determination we are
unexcelled. And for that reason if no other, we're
going down south next Saturday and . . .
