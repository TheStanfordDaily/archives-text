## British Methods Unusual; So Are Times 
### 
To the Editor:
I wish to apologize if I am one of those accused of
using "harsh and unkind" words regarding the Suez
situation in a recent letter to The Daily. I do not wish
to offend the Egyptian students. However. I think a
public airing of the situation is healthy.
As I remarked before, the methods at present em
ployed by the British seem unusual; but again these
are unusual times. To succumb to the demands of the
Egyptian Government at this time would be to abandon
that country (and the Sudan), to a hopeless and ir
responsible nationalism which could only lead, in
time, to continued restlessness, chaos, poverty and
neutralism.
With the advent of neutralism. Egypt and the en
tire Moslem world for that matter, would be set up
to he knocked over by Communism. The Egyptians
would not like this; nor can the Western world per
mit it to happen. In this shrinking world no one
nation can hope to remain static. Rather, ii is hound
to he touched, to be shaped by other nations and
newer concepts. Necessity also lends a hand, and
Egypt is necessary to the security of the world.
As for the 1936 treaty between Britain and Egypt
which contradicts the UN Charter: Why doesn't the
UN do something about it? Is it because the treaty does
not really contradict the Charter, or is it because nn
country or group of countries is able to reason with
Egypt at this time, including the UN?
The Egyptian Government is riddled with corrup
tion. It can't afford to be reasoned with. Without the
British to think about, the Egyptian people will begin
to wonder about such things as the 400 acre land sale
near Alexandria which was to be purchased by the
poor. Among the "poor"' new owners were "relatives
of Naha Pasha's wifeâ€”her fcister, her twelve-year-old
niece, ten-year-old nephew, her brother and his wife."
Naha Pasha's government observed closely the
success of Iran's Mossadeq in running the British
out of his country. Here was a chance for Egypt to
do the same thing while the British were apparently
in a "getting out" mood. The plan, of course, back
fired and Naha Pasha is unable to match deeds with
words. The British, as might have been expected,
got tough and Egypt is powerless, its people desolate.
When the hysteria wears off, neutralism and real
danger sets in.
What's to be done? Well, the U.S. has. a plan or
rather, a sensible policy. The formation of a middle-
Ea.sl command which would put Egypt, the U.S.,
Britain. France and Turkey in control of the canal as
partners. This solution seems natural and painless.
But so far, Egypt has rejected the proposal.
