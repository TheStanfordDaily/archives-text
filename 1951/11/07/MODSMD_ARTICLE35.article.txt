# Intellectual Isolation

### 
To the Editor:
In comparison to the majority of large universities
Stanford is rather unique in its intellectual isolation
This statement is exemplified by the attitude of ex-
Dean Kimpton, who undoubtedly exi-iessed the view

point of the majority of the Board of Trustees.
"The University's primary purpose is education.
The primary purpose of political action groups is
propaganda."
Education implies more than the presentation of
data; it involves an attempt to stimulate a correlation
and comprehension of subjectivisms. An opinion is
based upon premise and developed from that point. A
student should Ik? capable of determining the relation
ship of premise to fact and the degree of logic involved
in the subsequent development. Our society is arti
ficial; the mores are based on premise. A university is
deficient if students are sheltered until graduation, and
then released without preparation for reality.
"Student political groups are under pressure to
he used as a front for outside organizations."
What is a front? Is it an organization, ostensibly
pure, that actually receives directives from another
group? The Young Republicans, for example, will ex
press ideas that are common to the Republican Party;
but if their opinions are openly stated no subversion is
involved. An operational criterion for ideas is inde
pendent of the source of inspiration.
"Stanford might he unwittingly committed to a
political stand by one of these groups."
It is improbable that the Board of Trustees could be
duped to the extent of tacitly accepting a political
stand. Innumerable examples exist on other cam
puses, wherein the apprehensions of Dean Kimpton
failed to materialize.
I do not believe that the arguments of Dean Kimpton
are sufficient reason to maintain relative intellectual
isolation.
