To the Editor:
I'm really .surprised when I can't find a note on the
ensational "Golden Bear" rout in The Stanford Daily.
There wasn't even a screaming headline. Up till Oc
tober 13, you would have had to have been confined to
a well (sic) in order to warctvff an increasing sickness
from the volumes of idol worshiping spilled forth by
the local press on "the greatest team in coast history."
We have to listen to a similar record every year,
liut this year the situation was particularly poor.
This year after "OT Minn" went down, even I'appy
stopped worrying for a week.
There should he real pleasure when the rambling
goatherds of Berkeley are walloped. Especially, when
the "hero of heroes" was knocked around by a little
155-lb. guard. If is about time that the fatheaded
bear got a pasting other than the last two gridiron
smashings. The few of us Stanfordite:, who saw the
first of Cal's stunning defeats, witnessed a very tired,
shaken, bunch of Blue and Gold platoons stumble
to the showers. There was added enjoyment in the
stunned and : hocked expressions of the Cal rabble.
I hope The Daily doesn't mi ,s an opportunity the
next time Cal its thrashed.
