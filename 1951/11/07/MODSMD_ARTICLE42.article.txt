### "DIGGER" ODELL 
This Is the Finale
Well, the l ily papers have finally "discovered" us, and from here on in
the pressurej> on, for we'll be watched by everyone. We refer specifically
to the (I rti n Sheet ol the San Francisco Chronicle, but it applies to the others
us well.
They 'discovered" us with no little reluctance and only after the Cali
fornia Bears had gone down in inglorious defeat for the second time. But
now. though none of the sportswriters know how the Indians do it or what
they've j.wt. they are aware that Stanford has a football team that no one
has pushed around yet.
In fact, we're inclined to believe that the San Francisco sportswriters
are doing a bit of scapegoating. Here thy've been telling their readers
I »r weeks that Stanford's next game will be the supreme test, that now
they'll find out if tfic Cards have anything at all or have just been lucking
out. Come to think of it, so have we. However, to date the Indians haven't
bad a supreme test and they haven't shown any more than they've had to.
This frustrates sportswriters. Their readers begin to wonder how far
inside their inside dope is. So now the columnists anil writers of sports are
beginning to chastise Chuck Taylor for holding out on them. They think he's
playing his Cards too close to his vest.
II the sportswriters had anything to do with it, they would have had
Gary Kerkorian go out in a Saturday past anil throw dozens of passes to
iVlcColl and clobber some poor team just to show people they could do it.
They just can't understand why Stanford doesn't pass more and why they
don't run wild. They can't figure out if we've been tested or not.
As far as we're concerned, Stanford has not been tested yet. If you want
reasons, try these on for size:
I. Our opponents, especially the reputedly powerful ones, have btfen
very uncooperative. They've met us with a sheaf of press clippings,
something the Indians haven't had much of. purporting that the Cards
have mcl their maker and are up against a powerhouse. And then—maybe
to frustrate us—they've gone out and played their worst game of the year.
If you don't believe us, take a look at Michigan, L'CLA, Washington, and
Washington State. Their coaches were all disgusted with their play after
the games.
2. For the above named reason, the Indians haven't had any pressure
applied to them to amount to much. The Kerkorian to McColl lias been
made all the more effective by the infrequent use of it, and the defense,
knowing that it does work, hasn't had to worry too much, thus making
them more effective. An excellent arrangement as far as we can see, so
why worry about testing?
The answer to that question is that there's no need to worry because
there is no more testing to be done. Next Saturday against USC will be
no test; instead it will be the finale. Not to discount Oregon State and Cal,
but we'll save them for another day. Right now the big problem is Troy.
This weekend the chips will be down. By Saturday night we'll either be
in or we'll be out.
The question of whether or not we can beat the Trojans:
A lot of people are worried mainly about USC's "gorilla" linebacker
I'at Cannamcla. Personally, we felt, even before Taylor voiced his opinion,
that Cannamela isn't worth the worry. Hell, he wears shoes just like Ted
Tanner and Chuck Essegian. All they've got to do is put a guy like Man
oogian on him. and his effectiveness will be cut considerably. According
to Stanford's linecoach. Joe Kuetz. Cal's Kichter and UCLA's Moomaw
are better than Cannamela. but the Trojan defensive setup makes him
look better.
No, the man we're afraid of is USC's tailback, Frank Clifford. Asked to
compare him to Bruin Paul Cameron, Ruetz, who has seen them both in
action, slated with assurance that Gifford is much more of a threat. Al
though not the passer that Cameron is, Gifford is faster and more of a break
away man Once he gets through the line, he's a hard man to bring down.
As far as we're concerned, it's now or never. Our Rose Bowl tie is still
fi i sale, but Saturday night it will either be taken off the market or thrown
in the nearest waste basket.

As far as we're concerned, Stanford has not been tested yet. If you want
reasons, try these on for size:
I. Our opponents, especially the reputedly powerful ones, have btfen
very uncooperative. They've met us with a sheaf of press clippings,
something the Indians haven't had much of. purporting that the Cards
have mcl their maker and are up against a powerhouse. And then—maybe
to frustrate us—they've gone out and played their worst game of the year.
If you don't believe us, take a look at Michigan, L'CLA, Washington, and
Washington State. Their coaches were all disgusted with their play after
the games.
2. For the above named reason, the Indians haven't had any pressure
applied to them to amount to much. The Kerkorian to McColl lias been
made all the more effective by the infrequent use of it, and the defense,
knowing that it does work, hasn't had to worry too much, thus making
them more effective. An excellent arrangement as far as we can see, so
why worry about testing?
The answer to that question is that there's no need to worry because
there is no more testing to be done. Next Saturday against USC will be
no test; instead it will be the finale. Not to discount Oregon State and Cal,
but we'll save them for another day. Right now the big problem is Troy.
This weekend the chips will be down. By Saturday night we'll either be
in or we'll be out.
The question of whether or not we can beat the Trojans:
A lot of people are worried mainly about USC's "gorilla" linebacker
I'at Cannamcla. Personally, we felt, even before Taylor voiced his opinion,
that Cannamela isn't worth the worry. Hell, he wears shoes just like Ted
Tanner and Chuck Essegian. All they've got to do is put a guy like Man
oogian on him. and his effectiveness will be cut considerably. According
to Stanford's linecoach. Joe Kuetz. Cal's Kichter and UCLA's Moomaw
are better than Cannamela. but the Trojan defensive setup makes him
look better.
No, the man we're afraid of is USC's tailback, Frank Clifford. Asked to
compare him to Bruin Paul Cameron, Ruetz, who has seen them both in
action, slated with assurance that Gifford is much more of a threat. Al
though not the passer that Cameron is, Gifford is faster and more of a break
away man Once he gets through the line, he's a hard man to bring down.
As far as we're concerned, it's now or never. Our Rose Bowl tie is still
fi i sale, but Saturday night it will either be taken off the market or thrown
in the nearest waste basket.
This Is the Finale
Well, the l ily papers have finally "discovered" us, and from here on in
the pressurej> on, for we'll be watched by everyone. We refer specifically
to the (I rti n Sheet ol the San Francisco Chronicle, but it applies to the others
us well.
They 'discovered" us with no little reluctance and only after the Cali
fornia Bears had gone down in inglorious defeat for the second time. But
now. though none of the sportswriters know how the Indians do it or what
they've j.wt. they are aware that Stanford has a football team that no one
has pushed around yet.
In fact, we're inclined to believe that the San Francisco sportswriters
are doing a bit of scapegoating. Here thy've been telling their readers
I »r weeks that Stanford's next game will be the supreme test, that now
they'll find out if tfic Cards have anything at all or have just been lucking
out. Come to think of it, so have we. However, to date the Indians haven't
bad a supreme test and they haven't shown any more than they've had to.
This frustrates sportswriters. Their readers begin to wonder how far
inside their inside dope is. So now the columnists anil writers of sports are
beginning to chastise Chuck Taylor for holding out on them. They think he's
playing his Cards too close to his vest.
II the sportswriters had anything to do with it, they would have had
Gary Kerkorian go out in a Saturday past anil throw dozens of passes to
iVlcColl and clobber some poor team just to show people they could do it.

that Cannamela isn't worth the worry. Hell, he wears shoes just like Ted
Tanner and Chuck Essegian. All they've got to do is put a guy like Man
oogian on him. and his effectiveness will be cut considerably. According
to Stanford's linecoach. Joe Kuetz. Cal's Kichter and UCLA's Moomaw
are better than Cannamela. but the Trojan defensive setup makes him
look better.
No, the man we're afraid of is USC's tailback, Frank Clifford. Asked to
compare him to Bruin Paul Cameron, Ruetz, who has seen them both in
action, slated with assurance that Gifford is much more of a threat. Al
though not the passer that Cameron is, Gifford is faster and more of a break
away man Once he gets through the line, he's a hard man to bring down.
As far as we're concerned, it's now or never. Our Rose Bowl tie is still
fi i sale, but Saturday night it will either be taken off the market or thrown
in the nearest waste basket.
