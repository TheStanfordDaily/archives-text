# The 						Vow that Beat Troy
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
A grim, determined bunch of
freshmen gathered in the locker
loom before the game and took an
oath never to lose to the University
of Southern California on the foot
ball field. They then left their lock
er room and trounced the freshmen
of Troy 39 to 6 â€”and the fabulous
Vov Boys were on their way. The
year was 1932, and Howard Jones
and his Thundering Herd had been
making mincemeat out of Stanford
t< ams since 1920. For five years the
Indians had been unable to move
tiie massive men of Troy, until they
took their vow.
i .oin then on the Indians made
history. In 1933, '34. and '!>!) the
Indians took the measure of El
Trojan, and in each case took the
Rase Howl invitation with it. In
1933 they took their first game
from the Trojan varsity, 13-7, and
lost but one game during the sea
son (to YVashirvjton, 6-0), and
then their famous Rose Bowl
game with Columbia, 7-0.
In 1931 they won nine, tied
Santa Clara, 7-7. and had but two
touchdowns scored against them
all season until their defeat by Al
abama. in the Rose Bowl.
In this season they beat SC 16-0.
lo give them their worst beating
since the series started in 1905.
in 1935, the Indians seemed to
play nothing but defense for most
of the season. They lost but one
game, that to UCLA, 7-6, and had
a total of but 13 points scored
against them all season. In a hard
ln ight game in the Coliseum, the
Vow Boys plowed under the bat

tered Trojan Horse for the third
straight time on Monk Moscrip's
field goal, 3-0. This season of tight
games saw Stanford down Washing
ton, 0-0; Santa Clara, 9-7; and final
ly Southern Methodist in the Rose
Bowl, 7-0.
These freshmen who took their
vow and came out to defeat the SC
frosh on that November day in 1932
didn't know it then, but they were
to write the first installment to one
of the greatest chapters in Stanford
sports annals. They were stars, ev
ery one. From end to end and right
through the backfield. There was
Monk Mo.-,crip, All-American in '34
and '35, and Keith Topping at ends;
Horse Reynolds, All-American in
'34, and Jim Callaway at tackles:
Woody Adams, playing behind
Stanford's great All-American Bill
Corbus in 1933 but first string from
then on, and Larry Rouble at
guards; and Wes Muller at center.
The backfield was flooded with
stars, all triple-threaters in their
own right. There was Frank Alus
tiza at quarterback, the famous
Bones Hamilton, Buck Van Del
len, and Jim Coflis at halfs; and the
never-to-be-forgotten spark plug of
the team, All-American in 1934 and
1935, Bobby Grayson, at fullback.
The Vow Boys are fione now;
nothing is left but the fond mem
ories of past Rose Bowl games
and past glory. They played three
years of the greatest football the
Farm has ever seen, and will be

remembered always for what they
did and how they did it. The
hoys who made the vow are gone,
hut it is still hoped that those fa
mous words, "Never lose to SC,"'
might still he echoing around
these hallowed old halls. Come
this Saturday, many ex-foothall
stars who took that vow, now
nothing but "old grads," wil pray
hopefully that their vow, so sa
cred to them, will still be remem
bered.
