# Kerkorian in Top Form
## 
### 
I The chips are down and the In- [
liuns appeared to know it last night j
| as they ran through a long and >
[ strenuous workout finishing up un- j
I der the lights.
Chuck Taylor's boys, who have
not seen defeat this year, ran
through old and new plays with
the polish of champions. (»ary i
Kcrkorian was in his usual top
form as he completed pass after
pa«-s. loiyy and short, to a multi
tude of receivers. Halfback Bob
Bryan looked good on one play !
in particular as he shot down the j
field to retrieve a Kcrkorian toss. '
Trylor left little doubt last night 112
i that the pass, Stanford's ace-in-the- i
| hole weapon, will be put to cons id -
I erable use against the Trojans and
I us in the past Bill MeColl will be
i the lavorite target. MeColl in yes
i terday's drills looked like a profes
sional. His blocking was sharp when '
1 he was assigned that duty, and he
caught half a dozen passes when '
called on.
When running plays were called, i
j the other half of the Armenian
| Twin combination was used exten
sively and halfback Harry Huga
sian, the Indian workhorse, came
' through for extra yardage. Huga- j
sian is having his greatest season
I and at present has the top rushing
| average on the squad with 4.1 yards
per carry. Although he has received
little press notice, Harry Is the most
! consistent runner the Cards have.
He has picked up a yard whenever
Stanford needed it and has scored !
j seven touchdowns to date.
While the offense went through j
! their workout, the defensive unit j
| ran through their defensive pat- j
' terns against the Braves who
I worked USC's single wing and
winged T formations. The de-
I fense, minus the services of line
j backer Chuck Essegian, who
j watched unsuiled from the side
| lines nursing a cracked rib.
1 looked good and appeared to real
ize the most of Saturday's game
will depend on how they stop the
Trojans' famed tailback. Frank
j Clifford.
