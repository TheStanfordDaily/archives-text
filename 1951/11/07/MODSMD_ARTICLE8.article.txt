# Vandals Paint 'C' On Hoover Tower
## 
### 
Vandals believed to be youths
from the Palo Alto and Redwood
City area, splashed Cal's initials
in yellow and blue paint on
Hoover Tower, Memorial Court,
and Inner Quad Monday night
in the worst "paint raid" in Stan
ford's history.
University authorities estimate:!
that hundreds of dollars' worth of
damage was inflicted when paint -
happy raiders defaced many of
the campus's famed buildings and
scorched a giant "C" into the lawn
facing Hoover Tower.
The damage was inflicted by van
dals "who probably were not Cal
students," said Fred Glover, Stan
ford's director of information.
Glover said lie based his con
clusions on the fact that 'the
Stanford-Cal game is still pretty
far away, and we do not have a
precedent for such hoodluniism
so early in November."
Campus officials theorized that,
the painting spree, which they de
scribed as the wont in Stanford's
history, might have been commit
ted by a raider gang similar to the
group arrested recently by campus
police after they blazed a GO-foot
"C" into the turf at Stanford Sta
dium.
Wayne Alley, president of the
student, body, was also of the opin
ion that Cal student..'? were not in
volved in the damaging paint spree
and said:
"This is another indication of
the lack of community responsi
bility in Palo Alto and Redwood
* City for the activities of young
people."
The as yet. unnamed raiders
blotched a large blue "C" and a
"Cal" on either side of the entrance
to Hoover Tower and painted "Cali
fornia" on the steps leading into the
famed library. University authori
ties estimated that several days of
work and many hundreds of dollars
would be required to repair the
damage.
"( " and "Cal" in yrflow and
"( al" in blue were daubed on the
walk by the side of flic Art (Jal
lery and a seven-foot "('" was
smeared at the center of Inner
(fuad. Memorial Court has "Cal"
painted in four - foot letters in
three places on walks, and simi
lar letters were painted in front
«»f the Main Library.


BLUE, YELLOW, WHlTE—Hoover Tower was only one of sev
eral places on Quad marked with "C" and "Cal" Monday night.
Cost of removing paint from The Tower alone will cost several
hundred dollars. Memorial Court, Main Libe, and the Art Gal
lery were also marked.
