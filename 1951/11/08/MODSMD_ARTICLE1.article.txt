USC requested that ail Farm stu
dents enter gate 11 at the Coliseum
and then procede to tunnels 7 or 8
to enter the rooting section, which
will be mixed.
Card stunts have been planned
and the new trick of showing the
half-time score for each team will
he performed in stunts 11 and 15.
The trick looks like a scoreboard
on which there arc two sections,
numbered I and U. each one being
for a digit.
If the digit, following the roman
numerals on your instruction card
corresponds to your section on the
.scoreboard, a black card is to be
shown. If not, show a white card.
For example, if the score is 0 to 7,
the people in section I would show a
black card if they have an 0 follow
ing the roman numeral and white if
not. The people in II would do the
Fame for 7.
Women can buy pom poms and red
feathers at. the game.
