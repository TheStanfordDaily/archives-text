# FORUM GROUP
## Excom Says 'No' to New Constitution 
### 
Excom defeated a motion to
approve the constitution of the
Peace Problems Forum group,
by a unanimous roll call vote
last night.
The motion was tabled at last I
week's Excom meeting because of
vagueness of the constitution, and
was recalled last night after more
specific provisions were, inserted.
The constitution provided for fo
rums to be held on campus on prob
lems of world peace, with speakers
from the faculty and from various
peace organizations.
The idea was to stimulate thought
on the .subject, with no attempt to i
determine or sponsor anv policy on
the issues, according to Hank Vilas, j
who spoke in support of the group, j
The group would express opinions j
only on ''general" issues and only j
with concurrence of three-fourths |
of the membership. In that sense it
would he partisan, Vilas said.

Excom defeated the motion after I
a recommendation by Conrad von
Bibra, JIR head, that the Peace
Forum Problems group be a non
partisan committee integrated with i
(he lIR. He urged disapproval of ]
the group's constitution as an inde- j
pendent, non-partisan group.
Main arguments against approval I
were that the lIR is already per- 1
forming the functions the forum
group would fulfill. Vilas argued
that the forum group is different in
I that it concentrates on the single
problem of peace.
Bill Ford, Row representative,
I thought "almost all" international
! problems deal directly or indirectly
with problems of peace, and that
i the problems wouldn't differ much
' from those lIR deals with.
Grant-in-Aid Fund
Excom also approved the "Dimes
| for Diplomas" fund, with one
j amendment. The fund is to provide
. $2.12P) for grants-in-aid, preference
I to be given to veterans. The amend
ment provided veterans get prefer
ence "all other things being equal."
The possibility of the ASSU spon
| soring the unveiling of two plaques
in Memorial Hall, commemorating
students killed in World War 11,
1 was discussed briefly.
The 5:30 meeting broke up early
|so that Excommers could attend
S their quarterly party.

The constitution provided for fo
rums to be held on campus on prob
lems of world peace, with speakers
from the faculty and from various
peace organizations.
The idea was to stimulate thought
on the .subject, with no attempt to i
determine or sponsor anv policy on
the issues, according to Hank Vilas, j
who spoke in support of the group, j
The group would express opinions j
only on ''general" issues and only j
with concurrence of three-fourths |
of the membership. In that sense it
would he partisan, Vilas said.
Integrated in Illi
Excom defeated the motion after I
a recommendation by Conrad von
Bibra, JIR head, that the Peace
Forum Problems group be a non
partisan committee integrated with i
(he lIR. He urged disapproval of ]
the group's constitution as an inde- j
pendent, non-partisan group.
Main arguments against approval I
were that the lIR is already per- 1
forming the functions the forum
group would fulfill. Vilas argued
that the forum group is different in
I that it concentrates on the single
problem of peace.
Bill Ford, Row representative,
I thought "almost all" international
! problems deal directly or indirectly
with problems of peace, and that
i the problems wouldn't differ much
' from those lIR deals with.
Grant-in-Aid Fund
Excom also approved the "Dimes
| for Diplomas" fund, with one
j amendment. The fund is to provide
. $2.12P) for grants-in-aid, preference
I to be given to veterans. The amend
ment provided veterans get prefer
ence "all other things being equal."
The possibility of the ASSU spon
| soring the unveiling of two plaques
in Memorial Hall, commemorating
students killed in World War 11,
1 was discussed briefly.
The 5:30 meeting broke up early
|so that Excommers could attend
S their quarterly party.
