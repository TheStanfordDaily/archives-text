WASHINGTON, n'ov. 7. (UP)
—President Truman appealed to
Russia tonight to accept the
West's new disarmament pro-!
prosals to prevent another v/ar, !
but he warned the United States
will not relax its own defense
drive until a fool-pioof program
is nailed down.
He made the appeal in a nation- ;
wide radio and television address.
only a few hours after Britain, !
France, and the Unitrd States un- |
folded details of the plan before j
the Unitrd Nations General Assem- !
bly in Paris.
Big Three flan
The President described the Big I
Three proposal as a "real, workable !
system" and a "cornmonspn.se way" !
of reducing costly armaments and
lessening the risk of war. If Rus- |
sia really wants peace, said, the
men in the Kremlin will accept the ;
plan and tell their people about it.
He said thai if Russia rejects the
plan, the people of the world will
know who really wants nnd '
who does not. At ln<-> nie time,
he marie an end of I.he Korean war
a condition to any negotiations
aimed at working out a "real, down
to-earth" disarmament plan.
The Western proposal for cutting
down all types of a. mod forces and
weapons, including atomic bombs,
would tackle the problem in stages
and each stage would he com
pleted before the next we • started.
Must Disclose Strength
First, all nations would disclose
their present strength. After that,
UN inspection teams would verify
reports by the various nations
and maintain a "continirni;'' amis
inventory. This would be followed
by a gradual reduction of arm , 'ill
under "continuing" controls.
Mr. Truman said the key" to the
proposal i. to find out "< *actly and
precisely" just what arms and
armed forces each country ha-. Un
less such a step is t iken, he said,
"no real progre,, can be made to
ward regulating an 1 reducing ar
maments."
This won id mean at ira I a par
tial breach in the Iron Curtain- .1
step Russia long ha; refused to take
-and Mr. Truman took note of that
! fact:
(to ssia's Attiluiie Known
"Any nation which is not willing
to agree to this step, and to carry it
out, is not. really interested in dis
armament. The Soviet government
! has at various times talked about
1 reducing armaments, but they have
I never proposed an effective . ystcm
for finding out the fact>."
He pledged thai the United States
will not ease its mobilization pro
gram or the fight against aggres
sion 111 Korea until a satisfactory
1 disarmament plan i- a .reed upon.
