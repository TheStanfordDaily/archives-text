# Stanford Spirit on Display
## 
### 
Stanford Spirit goes on display for the South
land this week. Los Angeles and environs will
be seeing red at every turn as some 4,000 stu
dents head for the USC game. The good times
will start Friday night, be channeled into or
ganized frenzy Saturday afternoon, and break
loose into the bigest post game celebration in
years after the Terrific Taylors have added SC's
scalp to their growing string.
Getting back to Friday for a moment, Rally
Com and the Los Angeles Stanford Club have
arranged for a giant rally at Lafayette Park at
9 p.m. The Los Angeles Planning Commission
has agreed to let Stanford students use the park
as a rally site. So downtown Los Angeles will
hear the rock and sock of a Stanford rally in the
heart of Trojan territory.
Now the Los Angeles Planning Commission
isn't blind to the facts of life. When they
agreed to the rally idea they added the im
portant provision that students refrain from
damaging park property during the rally.
They were sold on the idea that Stanford can
conduct a great rally without the senseless
dafriage that sometimes follows the unleash
ing of mass emotions.
The best rallies aren't the rowdiest, anyway.
The ones we remember best were the tremen
dous Big Game rallies in the dry bed of Lake

Lag. Unparalleled noise and enthusiasm and
"pull together" spirit, but no damage to prop
erty.
Just as Stanford teams are famous from Coast
to Coast for their fighting spirit, so the Stanford
rooters have a reputation among colleges in
the USA for great spirit coupled with great
sportsmanship. College newspapers often refer
to Stanford Spirit when they're talking about
their own school. A "Beat the Trojan" rally of
the right sort will let the sons of Old Ess See
know the Indians have arrived.
A rally of the wrong kind—the kind you
might expect from a few schools hut not
Stanford—will give us a black eye and make
things very difficult indeed for the city plan
ning commission, the group which was sold
on Stanford.
While on the subject of the USC battle, the
old "drive carefully" warning is out again. One
Trojan rooter was killed in an auto accident
while driving north to Berkeley a few weeks
ago. Let the screaming this week be done by
lungs and not brakes.
And one more thought—Let's hope the yell
leaders don't take those pre-reg signs about
"Save the Axe Yell for Big Game" too seri
ously. Just in case the right time comes Sat
urday.
