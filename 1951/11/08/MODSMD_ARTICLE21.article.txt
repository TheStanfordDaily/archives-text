### PETE CROTHE 
A BULL SESSIONER LOOKS AT MUSIC
Whenever I get a grade in a test that is lower than
"C" I am inspired to write about the course. I recently
picked tip a "D" in a Music I quiz. I am inspired.

Don't get me wrong. This won't
be sour grapes stuff. Actually,.
Music I (Music Appreciation) is
one of the best courses in the
school. It is well-instructed and
broadening ,to the intellect. The
only hitch is that if you go into
the class knowing nothing about
music any deeper than the Fire
house Five Plus Two, you are
somewhat at a loss. I am some
what at a loss.

The trouble is that you have to read meaning into
everything. I find it exceedingly difficult to read
meanipg into "Happy Birthday to You," much less
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in C Minor. It's getting
so that I can't listen to a piece without being com
pelled to find out the inner significance of what the
third French horn is saying.
But I should like to inform the musically erudite
that I am not a complete novice as far as the classics
are concerned. Two of my favorites are Bach and
Handel. What finer songs are there than "Carry Me
Bach to West Virginia" and "Handel the Bisquits To
Me, Mirande?"
Someday I shall write an expose on how classical

music was written. Good historical evidence gives
reason to believe that the following scene once took
place between Ludwig Von Beethoven and, Wolfgang
Mozart:
Beethoven: "You know, Volfgang, zis music racket
iss fun. I think I write a great zimphony. Ze pur
pose of zis zimphony vill be to confuse students zat
half to study music in, say 1951."
Mozart: "Ya, Ludvig, iss zenzational plan. Und I
tell you vat I do. I write a zimphony zat iss just like
yours,, und ven zose poor students haff to tell who
wrote it, vill they be confused! Iss good idea, no?"
Beethoven: "Holy Liederkrantz, zat iss a vunder
bar idea. But instead of making our zimphonies just
alike, I will add a sub-diminuendo to the diminuendo
in the fifth theme of the second key area of the third
movement. Zat vill allow the students who take
music tests to tell ze difference between ze two."
Mozart: "Ya, Ludvig, ho, ho, ho, ho, iss zere goot
idea. Of course, those on the inside vill be able to
tell ze difference. Those on ze inside vill include our
wifes und our children."
This is the inside story on how some of the great
classics were written. For a fuller explanation, get
my book, "A Bull Sessioner Looks At Music," when
I write it.
In this book, I will give treatment to one of the
greatest questions in operatic music. And that is,
"why in the opera, when the 250 pound baritone is
stabbed, instead of bleeding, he sings."
