# BULLY SESSION
## 
### SNAZU PITTS 
THE LITTLE GAME
Preceding the annual Big Game there is an equally
exciting and heated contest down on the Farm which
we shall call "The Little Game." The contestants are
Stanford women and Stanford men, and the lineup
varies as the case may be. The objective of this Little
Game is a date for the Big Game.
Do not think for one minute that just because we
refer to the Little Game diminutively that it lacks
any of the fight, gusto, enthusiasm, tears, or joys
involved in the Big Game.
Although the objective of both teams is relatively
the same, each is faced with a three-fold dilemma.
For the men it is:
1) Who should I ask out Big Game night?
Or more mercenarily stated — For whom
should I extinguish my finances?
2).If I ask her ("her" being a Stanford wo
an), will she accept? Or again with a dash
of realism—Will she go Dutch?
3) With the prospect of possible rejection
by all possible objectives, the last is the most
bitter and broaches on defeat—Should I bother
asking anyone at all?
For the opposing team, the women, who are on the
receiving line of this particular play, the following
thoughts ensue:
1) When will He ask me out? ("He" being
a singular objective among the Stanford men).
2) (A few weeks later) ... Will He ever ask

me out?
3) (Rather dishearted a few days before the
big night). Will anyone ask me out Big Game?
In addition to these dilemmas certain propaganda
disseminated by ex-Daily bull sessioners adds to the
confusion and unrest. The men have been led to be
lieve that all Stanford girls have been dated up weeks
before the Big Game, and any attempt on their part
to seek one would be degrading. On the other hand,
Stanford women are plagued by apprehension since
they have not been dated up weeks before the Big
Game as they are supposed to be, according to tra
dition.
The time question is very important in this little
game. The men don't know how long to wait before
asking out a girl. The women don't know when the
right time is to be asked . . . Two months in advance
seems over-eager and the night before, much too
casual.
As the deadline approaches the dilemma increases.
Men rush to the bawlout, while the women rush to
the phone. Throughout the campus there is confusion,
frustration, and anxiety.
So if you think the Big Game is something, wait
until the Little Game hits you.
One word of warning—No matter who wins the
struggle, by the time the victor gets around to having
his reward, he or she is so completely enervated
by the Big Game, that the objective of the Little
Game seems very very little.

the phone. Throughout the campus there is confusion,
frustration, and anxiety.
So if you think the Big Game is something, wait
until the Little Game hits you.
One word of warning—No matter who wins the
struggle, by the time the victor gets around to having
his reward, he or she is so completely enervated
by the Big Game, that the objective of the Little
Game seems very very little.
THE LITTLE GAME
Preceding the annual Big Game there is an equally
exciting and heated contest down on the Farm which
we shall call "The Little Game." The contestants are
Stanford women and Stanford men, and the lineup
varies as the case may be. The objective of this Little
Game is a date for the Big Game.
Do not think for one minute that just because we
refer to the Little Game diminutively that it lacks
any of the fight, gusto, enthusiasm, tears, or joys
involved in the Big Game.
Although the objective of both teams is relatively
the same, each is faced with a three-fold dilemma.
For the men it is:
1) Who should I ask out Big Game night?
Or more mercenarily stated — For whom
should I extinguish my finances?
2).If I ask her ("her" being a Stanford wo
an), will she accept? Or again with a dash
of realism—Will she go Dutch?
3) With the prospect of possible rejection
by all possible objectives, the last is the most
bitter and broaches on defeat—Should I bother
asking anyone at all?
For the opposing team, the women, who are on the
receiving line of this particular play, the following
thoughts ensue:
1) When will He ask me out? ("He" being
a singular objective among the Stanford men).
2) (A few weeks later) ... Will He ever ask

me out?
3) (Rather dishearted a few days before the
big night). Will anyone ask me out Big Game?
In addition to these dilemmas certain propaganda
disseminated by ex-Daily bull sessioners adds to the
confusion and unrest. The men have been led to be
lieve that all Stanford girls have been dated up weeks
before the Big Game, and any attempt on their part
to seek one would be degrading. On the other hand,
Stanford women are plagued by apprehension since
they have not been dated up weeks before the Big
Game as they are supposed to be, according to tra
dition.
The time question is very important in this little
game. The men don't know how long to wait before
asking out a girl. The women don't know when the
right time is to be asked . . . Two months in advance
seems over-eager and the night before, much too
casual.
As the deadline approaches the dilemma increases.
Men rush to the bawlout, while the women rush to
the phone. Throughout the campus there is confusion,
frustration, and anxiety.
