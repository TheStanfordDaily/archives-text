# Rash of Campus Vandalism Breaks Out
## 
### WALT MENNINGER 
As the Big Game nears and
the football rivalry increases in
tenseness, vandalism once again
rears its ugly head.
Stanford this year nas been re
minded of that fact more than once
by scorched turf and painted "C's,"
but Stanford isn't alone. Elsewhere
close rivalries have led to similar
damage.
The Oregon Daily Emerald re
ports that Oregon students were
responsible for the advance light
ing of the Oregon State College
homecoming bonfire; and cur
rently reports are circulating on
the OSC campus that Oregonians
were responsible for other de
structive acts.
It seems that a large "O" was
bunded, in the OSG tuff, and also

the word "Ducks" was painted in
yellow at various promkient places
on the campus.
The Kansas University - Kansas
State rivalry flared openly when
mysteriously before their annual
game last week, vandals smeared
paint on statues at both KU and
K State.
Both Oregon-OSC and KU - K
State rivalries, bitter through the
years, are tempered with "non
aggression" pacts similar to the
Stanford-California agreement.
A good summary of the vandalis
tic tendencies was given recently
when the Syracuse Orange at the
University of Syracuse, New York,
preached a solution to the problem.
Wrote the Orange editors, . .
It requires so little of the indi
vidual, actually. It merely asks
that he protect his own safety by
not embarking on ventures origi

nally intended to, prankishly or
otherwise, place the safety of an
other individual in jeopardy.
"Forget the empty 'heroism' of
enemy - campus raids. Why play
little boys' games with their statu
ary and other property?
"Rather, why not merit your self
respectability by proving that the
faith of the few in you —the student
body—who are the many, is a well
justified faith?
"No vandalism."
