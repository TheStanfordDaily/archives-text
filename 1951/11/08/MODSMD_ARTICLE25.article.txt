## New Truman Censorship Order Is Non-Political, Says Dr. Bush 
### DON GILLIN 
"In my opinion, there are no
political motives behind Presi
dent Truman's recent censor
ship order," said Dr. Chilton R.
Bush, director of Stanford's Insti
tute for Journalistic Studies, in a
recent interview.
"I think that Mr. Truman is guilty
of hasty action; however, I also be
lieve that he was sincerely alarmed
by the wide public airing that has
been given many of our supposed
'national secrets'."
Dr. Bush was speaking of the
President's new executive order,
instructing all agency heads, both
civil and military, to tighten con
trols and see that no more confiden
tial information is released for care
less public consumption. Many
prominent newspapermen have con
demned the extension of such cen
sorship to civilian bureaus, while
Mr. Truman's more severe critics
have been quick to accuse him of
seeking to prevent the exposure of
ripening scandals in his own ad
ministration.
Secrets Leak
"Mr. Truman has stated that 95
per cent of the nation's secret in
formation has already made an ap
pearance in our many newspapers
and magazines," continued Dr. Bush.
"This figure has been taken from a
report made by a commission of
Yale professors for the Central In
telligence Agency. Had Mr. Tru
man bothered to go into this report
a little more deeply, he would have
found that he had misinterpreted
its conclusion.
"The commission considered all
four classes of secret information,
including much that was confiden
tial one moment and available for
publication the next. The inclusion
of such classified material, although
quite necessary, tends to exaggerate
the importance of any actual dam
age that might have been done."
Two Reasons
Dr. Bush believes that there are
two primary reasons for the release
of such "confidential" information.
Much of this material has been
published in an effort to fool the
Soviets and frighten them into
abandoning any warlike intentions
that they may happen to have.
Many of our statesmen feel that
peaceful negotiations between the
two spheres will become productive
only when the Russians are con
vinced that the West is strong
enough to back up its end of the
bargaining. Publicity on such items
as the "Matador," a new guided
'missile, is no doubt intended to
speed up the process of conviction.
"Another, less admirable, reason
for such advertising has been the
keen rivalry that exists among the
various branches of the armed
forces. The Air Force, Army, and
Navy are constantly competing with
each other for both additional pres
tige and the additional appropria
tions that will go with it. Each de
partment is conducting its own se
ries of "secret" experiments and
each is publicizing any results
which it feels might have a favor
able effect on public opinion."
Checks Rivalry
The President's new edict was
probably intended to check the evil
effects of such rivalry. Unfortu
nately, the Chief Executive saw fit
to extend the ban to civilian agen
cies as well. The inherent danger

|in such a move is obvious. If
agencies find that they need only
disclose information which they
deem fit for disclosure, there will
be an irresistible temptation for
them to withhold all facts that
might possibly lay them open to
criticism or embarrassment.
"Dishonest officials "would be
given the power to conceal their
own dishonesty. Theft and corrup
tion would flourish. At the same
time, censorship in most civilian
bureaus would serve no practical
purpose. Surely the Department of
Agriculture has no information that
would, be peculiarly helpful to the
Russian intelligence agents."
Poor Timing
Aside from its other flaws, the
President's order was rather badly
timed. The budding scandals in the
Reconstruction Finance Corpora
tion and the Office of Internal Rev
enue have given Mr. Truman's en
emies a not too unreasonable oppor
tunity to decry his present action
as a pre-election attempt to pro
tect undeserving Democrats. Nev
ertheless, Dr. Bush strongly rejects
such accusations.
"Many people tend to think of
Harry Truman as a purely political
person," he commented. "They for
get that he has a sincere and deep
seated fear of Communism, and that
he often tries to rise above parti
san politics in his efforts to meet
the Soviet challenge. In this par
ticular case he rose too hastily and
with insufficient information on the
situation."
No Voluntary Censorship
Dr. Bush is also inclined to reject
Mr. Truman's plea for additional
voluntary censorship on the part of
the press itself. No editor would
willingly publish information detri
mental to his country's best inter
ests; however, few editors are as
qualified as are responsible govern
ment officials to decide just what is
or is not detrimental. In any case,

the great majority of editors are
staunchly opposed to the imposition
of censorship on cviilian agencies.
The President has shown himself
to be far from adamant in his stand.
On the contrary,'he recently prom
ised a committee from the Associ
ated Press 'Managing Editors' Asso
ciation that he would carefully re
consider the whole matter.
"In my opinion," concluded Dr.
Bush, "he will eventually revoke
the order, in so far as it applies to
civilian branches of the govern
ment,"

consider the whole matter.

the order, in so far as it applies to
civilian branches of the govern
ment,"

"In my opinion, there are no
political motives behind Presi
dent Truman's recent censor
ship order," said Dr. Chilton R.
Bush, director of Stanford's Insti
tute for Journalistic Studies, in a
recent interview.
"I think that Mr. Truman is guilty
of hasty action; however, I also be
lieve that he was sincerely alarmed
by the wide public airing that has
been given many of our supposed
'national secrets'."
Dr. Bush was speaking of the
President's new executive order,
instructing all agency heads, both
civil and military, to tighten con
trols and see that no more confiden
tial information is released for care
less public consumption. Many
prominent newspapermen have con
demned the extension of such cen
sorship to civilian bureaus, while
Mr. Truman's more severe critics
have been quick to accuse him of
seeking to prevent the exposure of
ripening scandals in his own ad
ministration.
Secrets Leak
"Mr. Truman has stated that 95
per cent of the nation's secret in
formation has already made an ap
pearance in our many newspapers
and magazines," continued Dr. Bush.
"This figure has been taken from a
report made by a commission of
Yale professors for the Central In
telligence Agency. Had Mr. Tru
man bothered to go into this report
a little more deeply, he would have
found that he had misinterpreted
its conclusion.
"The commission considered all
four classes of secret information,
including much that was confiden
tial one moment and available for
publication the next. The inclusion
of such classified material, although
quite necessary, tends to exaggerate
the importance of any actual dam
age that might have been done."
Two Reasons
Dr. Bush believes that there are
two primary reasons for the release
of such "confidential" information.
Much of this material has been
published in an effort to fool the
Soviets and frighten them into
abandoning any warlike intentions
that they may happen to have.
Many of our statesmen feel that
peaceful negotiations between the
two spheres will become productive
only when the Russians are con
vinced that the West is strong
enough to back up its end of the
bargaining. Publicity on such items
as the "Matador," a new guided
'missile, is no doubt intended to
speed up the process of conviction.
"Another, less admirable, reason
for such advertising has been the
keen rivalry that exists among the
various branches of the armed
forces. The Air Force, Army, and
Navy are constantly competing with
each other for both additional pres
tige and the additional appropria
tions that will go with it. Each de
partment is conducting its own se
ries of "secret" experiments and
each is publicizing any results
which it feels might have a favor
able effect on public opinion."
Checks Rivalry
The President's new edict was
probably intended to check the evil
effects of such rivalry. Unfortu
nately, the Chief Executive saw fit
to extend the ban to civilian agen
cies as well. The inherent danger

|in such a move is obvious. If
agencies find that they need only
disclose information which they
deem fit for disclosure, there will
be an irresistible temptation for
them to withhold all facts that
might possibly lay them open to
criticism or embarrassment.
"Dishonest officials "would be
given the power to conceal their
own dishonesty. Theft and corrup
tion would flourish. At the same
time, censorship in most civilian
bureaus would serve no practical
purpose. Surely the Department of
Agriculture has no information that
would, be peculiarly helpful to the
Russian intelligence agents."
Poor Timing
Aside from its other flaws, the
President's order was rather badly
timed. The budding scandals in the
Reconstruction Finance Corpora
tion and the Office of Internal Rev
enue have given Mr. Truman's en
emies a not too unreasonable oppor
tunity to decry his present action
as a pre-election attempt to pro
tect undeserving Democrats. Nev
ertheless, Dr. Bush strongly rejects
such accusations.
"Many people tend to think of
Harry Truman as a purely political
person," he commented. "They for
get that he has a sincere and deep
seated fear of Communism, and that
he often tries to rise above parti
san politics in his efforts to meet
the Soviet challenge. In this par
ticular case he rose too hastily and
with insufficient information on the
situation."
No Voluntary Censorship
Dr. Bush is also inclined to reject
Mr. Truman's plea for additional
voluntary censorship on the part of
the press itself. No editor would
willingly publish information detri
mental to his country's best inter
ests; however, few editors are as
qualified as are responsible govern
ment officials to decide just what is
or is not detrimental. In any case,

the great majority of editors are
staunchly opposed to the imposition
of censorship on cviilian agencies.

the order, in so far as it applies to
civilian branches of the govern
ment,"

"In my opinion, there are no
political motives behind Presi
dent Truman's recent censor
ship order," said Dr. Chilton R.
Bush, director of Stanford's Insti
tute for Journalistic Studies, in a
recent interview.
"I think that Mr. Truman is guilty
of hasty action; however, I also be
lieve that he was sincerely alarmed
by the wide public airing that has
been given many of our supposed
'national secrets'."
Dr. Bush was speaking of the
President's new executive order,
instructing all agency heads, both
civil and military, to tighten con
trols and see that no more confiden
tial information is released for care
less public consumption. Many
prominent newspapermen have con
demned the extension of such cen
sorship to civilian bureaus, while
Mr. Truman's more severe critics
have been quick to accuse him of
seeking to prevent the exposure of
ripening scandals in his own ad
ministration.
Secrets Leak
"Mr. Truman has stated that 95
per cent of the nation's secret in
formation has already made an ap
pearance in our many newspapers
and magazines," continued Dr. Bush.
"This figure has been taken from a
report made by a commission of
Yale professors for the Central In
telligence Agency. Had Mr. Tru
man bothered to go into this report
a little more deeply, he would have
found that he had misinterpreted
its conclusion.
"The commission considered all
four classes of secret information,
including much that was confiden
tial one moment and available for
publication the next. The inclusion
of such classified material, although
quite necessary, tends to exaggerate
the importance of any actual dam
age that might have been done."
Two Reasons
Dr. Bush believes that there are
two primary reasons for the release
of such "confidential" information.
Much of this material has been
published in an effort to fool the
Soviets and frighten them into
abandoning any warlike intentions
that they may happen to have.
Many of our statesmen feel that
peaceful negotiations between the
two spheres will become productive
only when the Russians are con
vinced that the West is strong
enough to back up its end of the
bargaining. Publicity on such items
as the "Matador," a new guided
'missile, is no doubt intended to
speed up the process of conviction.
"Another, less admirable, reason
for such advertising has been the
keen rivalry that exists among the
various branches of the armed
forces. The Air Force, Army, and
Navy are constantly competing with
each other for both additional pres
tige and the additional appropria
tions that will go with it. Each de
partment is conducting its own se
ries of "secret" experiments and
each is publicizing any results
which it feels might have a favor
able effect on public opinion."
Checks Rivalry
The President's new edict was
probably intended to check the evil
effects of such rivalry. Unfortu
nately, the Chief Executive saw fit
to extend the ban to civilian agen
cies as well. The inherent danger

|in such a move is obvious. If
agencies find that they need only
disclose information which they
deem fit for disclosure, there will
be an irresistible temptation for
them to withhold all facts that
might possibly lay them open to
criticism or embarrassment.
"Dishonest officials "would be
given the power to conceal their
own dishonesty. Theft and corrup
tion would flourish. At the same
time, censorship in most civilian
bureaus would serve no practical
purpose. Surely the Department of
Agriculture has no information that
would, be peculiarly helpful to the
Russian intelligence agents."
Poor Timing
Aside from its other flaws, the
President's order was rather badly
timed. The budding scandals in the
Reconstruction Finance Corpora
tion and the Office of Internal Rev
enue have given Mr. Truman's en
emies a not too unreasonable oppor
tunity to decry his present action
as a pre-election attempt to pro
tect undeserving Democrats. Nev
ertheless, Dr. Bush strongly rejects
such accusations.
"Many people tend to think of
Harry Truman as a purely political
person," he commented. "They for
get that he has a sincere and deep
seated fear of Communism, and that
he often tries to rise above parti
san politics in his efforts to meet
the Soviet challenge. In this par
ticular case he rose too hastily and
with insufficient information on the
situation."
