## Punts and Pitches This Is IT 
### 
As the lieutenant in the class "B" picture says as he is about to lead his
men over the hump, "This is it."
Verily, this is IT. Strangely, the game that was supposed to be IT will
be played at Berkeley this Saturday. Pre-season prophet's Said that the
Washington-Cal game would decide the PCC title. Instead, the Husky-
Bear tilt will be a battle of also-rans.
No, the game that is IT will be at the Los Angeles Coliseum, and 105,000
will sit in on the game of the year. For those who have .iust blown in from
the Antartic wastelands, we're referring to the Stanford-Southern California
tussle.
One thing is certain. Because of Southern Cal's unpopularity, Stanford
| has never gone into a game with so many well-wishers. Both Washington
and Cal consider the despised Trojans dirty, and if a Stanford victory is
announced over the loud-speaker at Berkeley, the roar will rock the very
foundation of the crumbling Campanile. Leo Durocher will be the guest
of honor at SC's homecoming celebration. Many consider this significant.
Durocher is the man who said, "Nice guys can't Win. When you slide into
second base, come in with your spikes up."
We are of the opinion that SC is not dirty, but just tough and hard
tackling. George Lynn has scouted the Trojans in their last four games, and
doesn't subscribe to the dirtyness theory. Neither does Pappy Waldorf.
At any rate, Southern Cal will go into the game as one-touchdown
favorites, and here are the reasons for their favoritism:
(1) Statistically, they have the best defensive team in the league. Lynn
doesn't spot a weakness in their defensive line, and the average weight is
216 pounds.
(2) If John Hall, Bull Sessioner Emeritus, were here, he'd call Pat Can
namela the ugliest football player in America. Life referred to hint as a
/ human gorilla, thereby wrecking his social life. SC coeds have better things
to do than go out with members of the ape family. But whatever may be
i) said about Cannamela, the fact remains that he is a devastating linebacker.
Cal rooters made the serious mistake of chanting, "Get 42, get 42." This
made the linebacker with the low-cut shoes see red and induced him to
even greater efforts.
(3) Troy has in Frank Gifford one of the most potent scoring threats on
the Coast. Chuck Taylor describes him as "the toast of the conference as far
as running is concerned." He is not the passer that UCLA's Paul Cameron
is, but he is more tricky and can go all the way at a given moment.
(4) Troy has a superbly conditioned outfit and doesn't tire in the fourth
quarter.
(5) Southern Cal is undefeated.
Jess Hill's underlings are favorites for these reasons. We are of the
conviction that Stanford is going to win, because:
(.1) As we have suggested before, the Indians are a come-through outfit.
When the chips are down, that's when you can look for clutch performances:
(2) The team attitude. Connie Jarvis reports that the attitude the team
is taking this week is something he's never seen since he's been trainer. The
guys are confident that they are going to win . . . not cocky, but confident.
They feel that they have jelled as a team, but they still believe that they can
improve. That is why many of the players are coming out to practice a half
hour early. It's not a very ordinary thing when kickballers aren't satisfied
with more than two hours of grueling practice. Our gang has to tack a half
hour on . . . specifically Bill McColl, Norm Manoogian, Jack Bonatti, Dick
Horn, John Broderick, and others. There's not another end in the country
who's closer to being perfect than McColl, and yet he still feels he can im
prove. If there's a well-conditioned gridder on the coast, it's the muscular
Manoogian, and yet Norm figures he still can be in better shape.
(3) The Kerkorian-to-McColl pass is the most effective offensive weapon
in the PCC. This weapon has been used sparingly so far, but watch for it to
explode this Saturday. We saw McColl at his best against Michigan, and
the simple truth of the matter is that there is absolutley no defense that
can stop him. SC can hit him at the line of scrimmage, put a forest of de
fenders on him, knock him off balance, and he'll still come up with un
believable catches.
(4) The Card running attack, smoothly engineered by Gary Kerkorian.
Runners like Harry Hugasian, Bob Mathias, Bob Meyers, Ron Cook, Wes
Laubscher, and Bobby Bryan know how to move that ball, aided by great
blocking by our offensive line.
(5) A defense that is downright miserly when it comes to giving up
touchdowns. Our pass defense is the league's best, and our line was success
ful in stopping Paul Cameron, who was more of a two-pronged threat than
Gifford.
(6) Stanford is undefeated, and Chuck Taylor has never lost a game in
23 trips from the barn as head coach.
Yes, this is IT, and we pick Stanford, 21 to 14.
