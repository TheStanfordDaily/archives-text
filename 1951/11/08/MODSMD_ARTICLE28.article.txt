By DICK KLEIN and PAUL ZIMMERMAN
(Today's Grid-O-Scope will compare the defensive outfits of both teams.
Tomorrow's will deal with offense.)
Name Wt. Ht. Pos. Ht. Wt. Name
RYE 199 6'0 LE 6'3 211 NIKOLOFF
Nikoloff, a hard charging soph, has improved greatly during the season.
He is extremely effective at shooting the gap. Ry$, a cagey veteran, has
been hampered by injuries all throughout his playing career. He is an ex
tremely steady player.
SLIGHT EDGE: USC
LATHAM 214 6'4 LT 6'2 247 ANE
Ane, a sophomore from Hawaii, will be the biggest man on the field to
morrow. Practically impossible to move out, the big tackle anchors the
Trojan defense. Latham, up from last year's Junior Varsity, is one of the
most improved players on the squad. He is well-known for his ability to
deliver in key situations.
STRONG EDGE: USC
* ■
KING 226 6'3 LG 6'1 208 PEV\'ANI
Peviani, who lettered as a soph last year, is one of the lightest man on
the Trojan defensive line. A hard charger, he has come a long way this
year. King, 13 pounds lighter than last year, is still the heaviest' Stanford
defensive man. Especially effective at rushing the passer.
SLIGHT EDGE: USC
CONE 204 5'11 RG 6'2 216 WILLHOITE
Willhoite, one of the few double-duty men on the Trojan sqiiad, is a
steady defensive performer. A junior, Elmer turned in a fine performance
against Army last week. Captain Jess Cone is easily one of the'finest de
fensive guards in the country. His spectacular defensive play during the
last three years has been an inspiration to his team-mates.
EDGE: STANFORD
KIRKLAND 198 6'2 RT 6'3 215 VAN DOREN
Van Doren, a junior is extremely fast for his size. He is one of the smart
est defensive tackles on the coast. Kirkland, a transfer from ijsc has time
and again impressed Stanford fans with his ability to stop w;7de stuff and
spill the passers. /
EDGE: USC /
EADIE 184 6'2V 2 RE 5'9 168 HATTIG
Hattig, one of the smallest defensive players on the coast, is extremely
fast. He is very good at rushing the passer and piling up epd runs. Eadie
and Hattig are probably the two best defensive ends on the/coast. Ron has
stopped countless opponent's drives with his vicious, hard-driving tackles.
SLIGHT EDGE: USC
TANNER 202 6'0 LLB 5'10 205 CANNAMELA
An uncanny ability for play diagnosis and murderous tackling power
gives the Gorilla-Man an edge over sophomore Ted. Tanndr is plenty rough
also. He personally stopped Washington's Hugh McElhenny for a loss when
the Husky needed only a foot for a first down.
EDGE: USC
ESSEGIAN 196 5'11 RLB 6'2 206 BOZANIC
Only a sophomore USC's George Bozanic has played great ball this season.
He and Cannamela probably form the best linebacker corps in the country.
Essegian, filling in admirably for the injured Gordy Rice, is an effective pass
defender and a sure tackier.
SLIGHT EDGE: USC
HORN 191 6'2 LHB 5'10 170 WELCH
Welch, a junior transfer from Akron, is a steady defensive halfback.
Against Army he pulled a key interception that set up a Trojan score. Horn
highlights the Stanford pass defense which is tops on the coast. A converted
quarterback, he will be in line for All-Coast defensive honors.
STRONG EDGE: STANFORD
THOMPSON 188 6'0 RHB 5'10 173 NUNIS
Nunis, a junior, has been hampered by injuries throughout most of the
season but he should be in top shape Saturday. He is a very good tackier.
Thompson, a converted end, covers an extremely large amount of territory.
A good pass defender. Bob frequently makes tackles at the line of scrimmage.
EDGE: STANFORD
SANDERS 174 0'1 S 5'10 175 WILLIAMS
Williams, a sure tackier, is tops in punt returns on the Coast. Against
Army he ran a punt back 70 yards for a touchdown. Sanders, only a fresh
man, is the third reason for Stanford's impressive pass defense. He also
hadnles the punts very well.
SLIGHT EDGE: STANFORD
CONSENSUS
WEIGHT AVERAGES: USC—200, STANFORD—198
Although SC has a seven to four man to man edge, Stanford's outstand
ing superiority in pass defense tends to equalize the defenses. USC has the
top rushing defense on the Coast, however.
DEFENSE EDGE: TOSSUP
