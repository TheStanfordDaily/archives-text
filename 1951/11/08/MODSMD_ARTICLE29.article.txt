# Mermen Seek Clean Sweep
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo team will
play two tilts down south this
weekend. On Friday afternoon they
tangle with UCLA and on Saturday
morning they will meet USC. They
should have little trouble disposing
of the Trojans, who are having an
off year, but the Bruin tilt should
be tougher.
The Cards beat the Bruins in an
argument-ridden 8-7 thriller, and

a second win over the Bruins would
assure Stanford of the PCC crown
and its first undefeated season in
history.
Stnaford will undoubtedly start
its perennial lineup of Bob Frojen,
Bob Wycoff, and Jim Gaughram at
forwards, Ash Jones, Mel Butler,
and Bert Holiday at guards, and
Russ La Telle in the goal.

There will be no intramural
games played either today or to
morrow because of the USC game
Saturday. Consult your Daily
Monday for further schedules.
Today is the last day to turn
in second-round scores in intra
mural handball, table tennis, and
hroseshoes. Third-round play will
begin next week. All games not
completed at end of second round
will be counted as forfeits.

BEAT THE TROJANS!
