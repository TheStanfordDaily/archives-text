# Rough Play Tops Scrum
## 
### 
In one of the most rugged sessions
of the season, the footballers ran
through a rough and tough scrim
mage against the jayvees. The var
sity played like it. was for keeps,
and several junior varsity men were
nursing lumps when the show was
over.
The running looked much sharp
er, and the blocking was very good.
Harry Hugasian looked like the
Hipster of old. Bob Mathias, besides
finding openings well, connected
with a long pass to speedy Bill Sto
rum. It was good for 40 yayds and
possibly a TD against the Trojans.
Norm Manoogiali and Jim Vick
were better than okay up front. The
defense worked against SC plays
operated by the jayvees. The only
disability was Jack Rye, who re
ported to practice with poison oak.
He's okay to play though.
