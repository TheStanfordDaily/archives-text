## Trojans Hold Overall Edge 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford will go into the game
Saturday trailing USC by five
games in the all-time Trojan-Card
series. USC has won 16, Stanford
11, and two have been ties. The
Trojans have scored 347 points to
the Cards' 246.
Probably the most famous games
in the series were the 1933, '34, and
'35 affairs. Stanford's Vow Boys,
who in 1932 as freshmen vowed
never to lose to Troy, defeated USC
13-7 in 1933, 16-0 in '34, and 3-0
in '35. Stanford went to the Rose
Bowl each of these years.
Perhaps one of the most thrilling
of the recent affairs was the 1949
affair when the Cards invaded the
Coliseum a 14-point underdog and
proceeded to run wild, beating the
Trojans 34-13. Gary Kerkorian
showed his versatility as he played
close to 60 minutes, intercepting a
pass and recovering a fumble on
defense. On offense, he completely
overshadowed USC's Jim "Mystic''
Powers, although Powers gained
290 yards passing. Bob White and
Bill DeYoung got loose for runs of
66 and 74 yards respectively.
Chuck Was Star
Another high point in the series
occurred in the 1942 game when
Chucik Taylor accomplished the
"lineman's dream," stealing the ball
from Mickey McCardle, USC half
back, and running for a touchdown.
The score by the Stanford guard
broke the Trojans' backs and the
Cards went on to win 13-0.
The longest winning streak by
any one school was USC's five vic
tories in a row from 1918 to 1923.
Five years later, under the fabulous
Howard Jones, the Trojans again
compiled a winning streak that
lasted for five seasons. The 1928-
1933 spree was no fluke. USC dur
ing those years had eight players,
Francis Tappaan, Orv Mohler, Er
nie Pinckert, Gus Shaver, Johnny

Baker, Ernie Smith; Aaron Rosen
berg, and "Cotton" Warburton,
picked on All-America teams.
Hold the Line
One of the most valiant efforts
was put forth in 1947 by the In
dians, who after not having won a
game all season, entered the Coli
seum four-touchdown underdogs to
the undefeated Trojans. They com
pletely bottled up the Trojan at
tack until late in the game when
USC wore down the Cards and
squeezed out a 14-0 victory. A high
point of the game was the line play
of Stanford tackle Atherton Phle
gfer, who completely outplayed
USC's Ail-American Johnny Fer
raro.
Last year the Cards managed to
come back to tie the Trojans after
being six - point favorites. Coach
Schwartz, in a surprise move, start
ed second-string quarterback Tom
Shaw. The Indians never seemed to
be able to get rolling until late in
the second half.
