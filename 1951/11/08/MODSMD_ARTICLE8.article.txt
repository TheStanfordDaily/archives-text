# Sheriff's Office on Trail Of Paint-Smear Vandals
## 
### 
Campus police and the Santa Clara County sheriff s office were
hot on a lead yesterday that might identify the vandals who, in a
Monday night paint raid, smeared many of Stanford's famed build
ings including Hoover Tower with blue and yellow paint.
A special investigator from the sheriff's office traveled to Berke-

ley yesterday to check a car that
was seen acting suspiciously near
! the campus Monday night.
Car Spotted Monday
The auto, seen speeding from the
| campus through Menlo Park, was
| noticed by several persons who re
ported the license number of the car !
to police. Ownership of the vehicle
i was traced to a Berkeley corpora-
I tion, and the detective was dis
patched to see if incriminating
traces of paint could be found in
: the vehicle.
The most costly damage was in- j
flicted on Hoover Tower, where 1
workers have encountered great j
difficulty in erasing the "C" and j
I "Cal" painted on either side of I
I the entrance into the library.
Damage Estimate Upped
Glover siad that the sandstone of i
the building was porous and the |
| paint pigment seeped deep into the j
material, making removal difficult
i.s not impossible. The information
director also .said that the estimate
of damage has jumped several hun- |
| dreds of dollars. He said that it j
would take workers several days ,
jto complete what, repairs they
could.

Cal Believed Innoccnt
Fred Glover, Stanford's director
of information, repotted yesterday
that, despite the lead uncovered by
police, he doubted whether Univer
sity of California students were in
volved in the paint, raid which saw
Cal's initials .splashed in foot-high
letters in many locations around
the campus.
Glover indicated that he was still
of the opinion that the vandals were
Peninsula residents "without uni
versity affiliations who arc bent on
hoodlumism." He compared the il
legal painters to a vandal gang of
four Palo. Alto men who plagued
the Stanford campus last month and
who are now facing one- to six
month sentences in the Santa Clara
County jail.
