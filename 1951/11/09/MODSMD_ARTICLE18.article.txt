# Eyes of Nation Turned Toward Battle of Year
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
Put an undefeated, win-hungry, determined bunch of Indians
into the Coliseum and make them a six-point underdog to a rug
ged, rough Thundering Herd from Southern California. That's to
morrow's game of the year for the entire nation: Stanford vs. USC
for the Pacific Coast Conference championship.

Two young coaches, Chuck Tay
lor and Jess Hill, in their first year
as headmen will try to keep their
flawless records (if you discount
SC's fluke loss to a service team)
intact. Stack the two teams against,
each other and there's not much to
push the scales one way or the
other. Both teams have the man
power at every position.
The Indians, still looking for a
tough customer, come into the game
in near perfect shape. Eric South
wood, flashy halfback, will not play
for the Cards. His knee responded
to healing, but two days ton late
according to the team doctor.
Also missing from the line-up will
be Gordy Rice and Tsar Calfee.
Both were hurt earlier in the sea
son, and their injuries have put
them out for the year.
The Trojans are in equally good
physical shape. Only Dick Nunis
and Jim Sears remain on the
doubtful list. Nunis is a frosh and
wa.« a top defensive hack. Sears
is a powerful running hack.
Members oC»the '51 Stanford team
go into this game with a record of
never losing to the despised Tro
jan. As freshmen, each class has
beaten SC. In 1949, the Indian.
scored an amazing 33-14 upset in
the very Coliseum. Arid last year,
the teams played to a deadlock, 7-7.

The Taylor - made Indians have
not been thinking much Rose Bowl.
It has been an all-out concentra
tion on downing the one, big imme
diate obstacle to an all-victorious
I season. And that's, oeai the Tto
jan. Once again, the red-haired
Chuck Taylor has predicted a win
for his charges. He hasn't been
wrong yet this year.
Over 100,000 arc expected to
pour into the impressive Coliseum
which was built in 19112 for the
I.os Angeles Olympics. At kirk
off time, which is set for 2 p.m.,
' there will be close to 1.000 Farm
rooters on hand. This will be a
new attendance record for a game
away from the Farm.
It has been only the last week
or so that many began to jump on
| the Indian caravan. Before, the
j string of victories was explained
i away as luck, meeting teams when
they were down, or flukes. But now
j these same .sports experts are be
| ginning to think that Stanford'.'
' ability is what overshadows the op
ponents.
Chuck Taylor will throw perhap .
I Stanford's best team in ten year;,
against the powerful foe from the
j sunny Southland. The big air arm
of the Stanford attack, although
under wraps for most of the time,
| is ready for plenty of action. The
great pass combination of Kerko
rian-to-MeColl i.s ready to make
like the Howell-to-Hntsori duo of
old. And this should drive any op
position crazy.
Bob Mathias. the cver-improv
ing fullback, will be ready to tote
the ball for those needed yards
Ron Cook. Harry Ifugasian, Bob
Meyers, and Wes l.aubscher will
supply the speed and at
the halfback posts. Skip Crist
will spell the Tulare Terror at
the line-plunging position.
Up front Norm Manoogian, hard
blocking guard, an'd Rod Garnet
! will lead the way for the yard
chewing backs. Tackles Johnny
Broderick and Jim Vick, guard Jack
Bonetti. and speedy Bill Storum
