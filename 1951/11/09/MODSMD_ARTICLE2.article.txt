### 
PARIS, Nov. 8 (UP) —Russia to
night ridiculed and rejected the
West's "foolproof" plan for inspect- |
ing and reducing the world's ar- |
senal and proposed instead a world j
conference for disarmament on So- \
viet terms.
The Soviets also dashed Korean l
armistice hopes by proposing a
cease-fire along the 38th parallel.
The Soviet "peace package" was
put before the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly by Russia's Foreign
Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky in a
75-minutc speech in which he bit- j
terly and repeatedly accused the t
United States of preparing a new i
war.
The West's disarmament plan he |
dismissed as "a dead mouse" . . . !
"designed to befuddle the people
of the world." *
His own four-point "peace" plan, 1
which omitted all mention of inter- j
national inspection of national arms j
.stocks and pinned Korean armistice
hopes to the old 38th parallel
boundary line, was promptly la- I
be led "ludicrous" by American and
British spokesmen.
Vishinsky urged that the Soviet
proposed world disarmament con
fcrence be held not later than next
June 1.
