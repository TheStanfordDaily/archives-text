### DICK McLEAN 
TIIE BIG WEEKEND
Tho recent picture of Pat Cannamela in Life Maga
zine brings to mind a football story.
The time was 1947 when Army was the scourge of
the east coast. When the Black Knights of the Hud
sun swept down from their windy point, some team was
in for a mauling. The Army theory of

to be the same as General Patton's
theory of war: "Kill 'em."
This the Army team did. The
managers on the opposing team
would bring a wheel barrow along
with the rest of the football gear.
(It facilitated the speedy removal
of bodies.)
The Army didn't neglect the
psychological aspect of battle
c ither. Before the game the Black
Knights would hold a little prac-

tice. They lined up in a right angle blocking drill,
one of the most dangerous and vicious exercises of
mayhem in the whole game. In this slight "warm up"
Army disposed of two of her own halfbacks and three
guards. (They left the mangled bodies on the field
as a kind of warning.) As a topper for the psychologi
cal attack all the Army linemen smeared their chins
with blood and inserted false fangs. (Just imagine the
reaction of the poor opposing player when he looked
up to see a grunting vampire-gorilla of a man staring
dumbly at his throat.)
With the opening "whistle the slaughter began. It
would usually take about an hour to play the fifteen
minutes of the first quarter. After every set of
downs the referees had to call time out to give the
boys on the wheelbarrows time to cart off the dead
and dying. When one of the managers collapsed from
total exhaustion, thye laid him on the ever growing
mound of bodies in front of the bench.
It was on one of these murderous Saturday after
noons that our story properly begins. Army was up
to its usual form. The score stood at 41 to 7. (Forty
one enemy dead and wounded to seven Black Knights
out of commission.) This score did not include the
missing.
One tackle, a brute of three hundred pounds who
didn't have to wear false fangs, committed a slight
atrocity. This tackle, it seems, was running down
lick! in an attempt to jump on the pile before the

whistle blew. Directly across his path lay the pros
trate form of an opposing player. Without even a
growl the Army tackle ran over the man's face with
his cleats churning.
A huge roar of protest eminated from the stands.
A hundred knives flashed in the Autumn sunlight, i
After all, this was going a bit too far.
The coach fearing a lynching pulled the brute off
the field.
"Cheta," began the coach trying to look stern, "Why j
did you run over that poor boy's face? You could !
have avoided him."
"Aw gosh," answered the sullen giant, "I would have {
had to break my stride."

Enough of this blood and gore stuff. Let's talk about !
something cheerful. Let's talk about automobile acci
dents.
Although this section begins with a humorous twist, J
I mean it seriously. This weekend is going to be one j
of the best of Fall Quarter. But it can easily be the â– 
worst for someone. I won't preach but let me list a '
few suggestions. I thipk they make sense.
1) Don't drive in caravan. The human is a com
petitive animal and the most natural thing is to
start racing. Going to Los Angeles together is one
thing. Turning Highway 101 into the Indianapolis
Speedway is another. Besides, it takes all the fun
out of the trip.
2) Be careful coming from the parties. Remember
that alcohol even in a moderate amount affects ,
your reflexes. Your mind can be as clear as a bell
and yet that connection between the eyes, brain,
and brakefoot is slowed down. This slight delay
translated into yards traveled can be deadly.
:i) Don't knock yourself out getting back Sunday
night. Fatigue does screwy things to your eyes
and 478 miles of on-coming bright lights doesn't
help them. If you're really beat, pull over to the
side of the road and cat nap for a few minutes.
Who's going to class Monday morning anyway?
4) Watch out for the cops in the hick towns along
the way. They pay about half their taxes from
sticking the "rich kids from Stanford" with traffic
fines.

Best of luck to the Big Red Machine, both varsity
and junior varsity. See youall in the Southland.
