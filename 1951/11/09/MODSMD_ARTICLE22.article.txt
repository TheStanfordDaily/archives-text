## Egyptian Blasts Middle East Command 
### 
(Editor's note: Sincc the two sides to the Egyptian
question have now been thoroughly aired in the
Campus Opinion columns, we suggest any further
argument be channelled into a public forum which
could be sponsored by lIK or some other group.)
To the Editor:
Jock Burrows contends the present demand for
cancellation of the 1936 treaty is to keep the public
from wondering about the 400 acre land sale near
Alexandria. It seems quite evident that such accusa
tions against the Egyptian government are nothing but
an attempt by the British to create division and shift
the focus away from them. This is just another ex
ample of the age old British method of "Divide and
Rule." To accuse the present Egyptian government of
corruption immediately after its presentation of a de
mand for complete withdrawal of all British troops
is completely irrelevant.
Furthermore, the responsible authorities have been
voicing Egypt's demand for final settlement of the
Sue/, canal problem since 1946, and not only recently
as the writer would have us believe in order to cover
up the alleged mismanagement in the government.
Both the previous ministers, Sidky Pasha and Nokrashi
Pasha, have tried their best to settle the matter. The
latter himself brought the case to the UN in 1949.
Nahas Pasha is only complying with public demand.
Study carefully the proposed plan for a Middle East
Command. Besides Egypt, what are the countries who

will take part in it? 1) Britain, who at the end of its
legal term for control of the canal comes up with the
proposal for a Middle East Command thereby con
tinuing its stay in Egypt; 2) France, who ruled in
Egypt for a short lived spell, was the first to conceive
of the idea of a Suez canal, carried out its construction,
and since has always dreamed of coming back to share
in its control; 3) Turkey, who was finally evicted after
ruling in Egypt for hundreds of years and would only
be too glad to return. Apart from the U.S. each of these
powers has a past in Egypt and has left behind it too
many scars to be forgotten by the Egyptian people.
Maybe now you can begin to see why Egypt re
jected the plan for a Middle East Command. Had the
powers that would make up the command been Switz
erland, Norway, and Sweden, for instance, who neither
have a past nor any permanent interests in Egyptâ€”had
the troops of these countries been proposed for policing
the canal zone, the proposal may have been better re
ceived.
Furthermore, realizing what a difficult time Egypt
is having in ridding herself of British control alone,
how much harder would it be to evict the four powers
of the Middle East Command once they have set foot
in Egypt. The writer also claims nobody is able to
reason with Egypt, including the UN. I wish to assure
you that there is still room for reasoning with the
Egyptians, provided the proposals offered to them are
reasonable.
