# Honor Code Applauded
## 
### 
In light of the recent question
ing of honor standards at univer
sities, Dr. Donald Winbigler,
Dean of Students, has written an
evaluation of the Stanford Honor
Code in a recent issue of the
Alumni Review.
Dean Winbigler affirms that the
Honor Code has proved effective
at Stanford with an amazingly small
number of infractions. He cites that
there was approximately one Honor
Code case for every 35,000 examina
tions given last year.
"In spite of the doubts ex
pressed elsewhere," he said. "I
find on the campus this fall no
special apprehension about the
future of the Code. A probable
reason is that the recent genera
tions have been verv careful not
to lake the Code for granted."
Winbigler pointed out for Alumni
Review readers that students, real
izing that the Code woultj not per
petuate itsx'lf, have devoted much
tim" and energy to the indoctrina
tion of new students.
The Dean explained that the
third - person responsibility under
the Honor Code entails a "special
social responsibility — an obligation
to protect one's fellow students
from any inherent weakness and to
preserve for all students the privi
leges of the Code," and as such be
comes "an exciting and vital force"
rather than a repugnant job of
"stooling."
The l>t*aii outlined the judicial

; procedure as follows: Alleged
violators are summoned before
the Council for Student Control,
which is composed of students on
the Men's and Women's Coun
cils. It hears the charges and any
defense of the alleged violator and
i may summon witnesses and take
| initiative as an investigating body.
The decision of the Council then
goes to Dean YVinbigler.
"Theoretically, if I were con
| vinced that the final result repre
] sen ted an injustice, it would be my
obligation to overrule the Council's
i recommendation. This I have never
had to do, and I doubt that I shall,
j for the Council's findings are emi
j nently fair," Winbigler said.
Those guilty of violations are
suspended, but may return to
Stanford after they have com
pleted the period of suspension.
A great majority of the few Hon
j or Code cases do return; and, as
| their identity has been protected,
have no difficulty in re-establish
ing themselves. Should a second
violation occur, however, perma
nent expulsion from the Univer
sity would result.
"In these days," said Dean Win
j bigler, "when the principles of hon
or in public life have been so se
j riously questioned, and when our
; preoccupation with society's re
sponsibility to look after individuals
has overshadowed consideration of
the individual's moral obligations
| to his fellow men, it seems to me
j that colleges and universities have
I a rare opportunity to help reverse

I the trend. This to me is the real
j significance of Stanford's Honor
! Code."

Those guilty of violations are
suspended, but may return to
Stanford after they have com
pleted the period of suspension.
A great majority of the few Hon
j or Code cases do return; and, as
| their identity has been protected,
have no difficulty in re-establish
ing themselves. Should a second
violation occur, however, perma
nent expulsion from the Univer
sity would result.
"In these days," said Dean Win
j bigler, "when the principles of hon
or in public life have been so se
j riously questioned, and when our
; preoccupation with society's re
sponsibility to look after individuals
has overshadowed consideration of
the individual's moral obligations
| to his fellow men, it seems to me
j that colleges and universities have
I a rare opportunity to help reverse

I the trend. This to me is the real
j significance of Stanford's Honor
! Code."
In light of the recent question
ing of honor standards at univer
sities, Dr. Donald Winbigler,
Dean of Students, has written an
evaluation of the Stanford Honor
Code in a recent issue of the
Alumni Review.
Dean Winbigler affirms that the
Honor Code has proved effective
at Stanford with an amazingly small
number of infractions. He cites that
there was approximately one Honor
Code case for every 35,000 examina
tions given last year.
"In spite of the doubts ex
pressed elsewhere," he said. "I
find on the campus this fall no
special apprehension about the
future of the Code. A probable
reason is that the recent genera
tions have been verv careful not
to lake the Code for granted."
Winbigler pointed out for Alumni
Review readers that students, real
izing that the Code woultj not per
petuate itsx'lf, have devoted much
tim" and energy to the indoctrina
tion of new students.
The Dean explained that the
third - person responsibility under
the Honor Code entails a "special
social responsibility — an obligation
to protect one's fellow students
from any inherent weakness and to
preserve for all students the privi
leges of the Code," and as such be
comes "an exciting and vital force"
rather than a repugnant job of
"stooling."
The l>t*aii outlined the judicial

; procedure as follows: Alleged
violators are summoned before
the Council for Student Control,
which is composed of students on
the Men's and Women's Coun
cils. It hears the charges and any
defense of the alleged violator and
i may summon witnesses and take
| initiative as an investigating body.
The decision of the Council then
goes to Dean YVinbigler.
"Theoretically, if I were con
| vinced that the final result repre
] sen ted an injustice, it would be my
obligation to overrule the Council's
i recommendation. This I have never
had to do, and I doubt that I shall,
j for the Council's findings are emi
j nently fair," Winbigler said.
