# SJS Tries 'Help Week'
## 
### 
Another step was made last week
in the changing of a "hell" week to
I a "help" week. The latest move
! was made at San Jose State College
where pledges and actives of all the
fraternities gathered together to
paint the First Congregational
Church of San Jose.
Arrangements for the project
j were made by the SJS Interfrater
nity Council, Dean of Students
I Stanley C. Ben/., and the minister
of the church.
Details on the project, as reported
by the Spartan Daily, point out that
the church provided paint, brushes,
I scaffolding, and insurance, while the
j fraternities gave the labor.
In as many shifts as were neces
! sary, says the Spartan, groups of
j 20 painters worked on the project,
i The Daily also explained that the
j college and church officials obtained
; clearance for the project from the
i San Jose Painters' Union.
