## The 						Sporting Line

In talking about the unbeaten Indians, the thing you hear the most is
a reference to the poise and come-through that the Varsity displays each
Saturday. It is this terrific mental attitude that makes them a winning
ballclub.
Along with the above, an awful lot of experts keep on questioning the
real talent on the squad. These writers wonder how the Cards remain un
defeated. Some have even called them the "How Boys." But all this chatter
about come-through and poise making up for the supposed lack of ability
reminds us a lot of another sports winner.
Yes, just a few weeks ago, the Sporting Green and other pages across
the country spoke in bewilderment about the New York Yankees. How
did these guys keep on top of the American League heap? Where were
they getting the men to field each day?
These were some of the questions that the sports writers kept asking
all season long. And they asked the same thing when the season was over.
How did the old Yankees stay up there? Many just couldn't believe that
the strange collection of veterans and youngsters could form a winning team.
But. they.did. Call it what you want. Call it the old moxie, the know-how,
or the come-through. Whatever it was, the Yankees had the stuff to take
the American League pennant, and then wrap up the big prize in the World
Series.
Now along come the '51 Stanfords. In pre-season dope, they were
ranked as also-rans. Sure, there were some of the old faces returning,
but experts thought they had lost their touch. And the crop of freshmen
were promising but didn't stack up with the rest of the league.
But what happens? Every week some player provides the spark or in
spiration to put over a win. Some sub would replace a valuable veteran and
do even better. Remind you of the Yankees? It looks something like the
same to me.
Somehow I am thoroughly convinced that the Cards, just like the old
masters of baseball, will go all the way and bring back winning football to
the Farm. To me, these Indians have the ability to play with any team in
the country and do okay. But it's going to be that spark, that come-through
that will make each Saturday another winning day.
It may be Bill McColl snagging a spectacular catch, or it may be Chuck
Essegian backing up the line with new-found strength and ability. The
most important thing is that as long as we field a team with this certain
spark, they are going to find a way to victory.
The Varsity ripped through practice sessions this week with a strange
mixture of confidence and fired-up determination. They want the win over
the Trojans more than anything else.
So, what are we waiting for? Let's head south and:
BEAT TIIE TROJANS!
