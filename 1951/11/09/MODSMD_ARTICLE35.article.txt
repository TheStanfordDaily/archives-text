Name Wt. lit. P«s. Ili. Wt. Name
STOIIUM 197 G'4 LE (i'l 185 ZIMMERMAN
One of the fastest men on the squad, Zimmerman sometimes doubles as
defensive halfback. A senior, he is a Kood blocker and pass catcher. Storum,
although not as good a pass receiver a;> Zimmerman, is by far the better
blocker. He is. also a speed-burner, running the 440 on the track team.
EDGE: USC
VICK 229 G'3 LT G'O 214 CONDE
Conde, a GO-minute player last year has been relegated to strictly of
fensive duties. lie is probably the best blocking tackle on the Coast. Vick,
who played defensive last year has fit into his offensive role beautifully. Big
and rugged, he is an outstanding blocker.
EDGE: USC
MANOOGIAN 197 51ft LG s'lo 2(15 SANBRANO
A 1 Sanbrano, a junior, is one of Troy's steadiest linemen. Last week
against Army he was particularly effective at pulling out for the wide stuff.
Manoogian, named by Chuck Taylor as one of the greatest offensive guards
he has ever seen, is easily the best blocker on the Coast. He is a good All-
American candidate.
STRONG EDGE: STANFORD
GARNER 195 G'O C G'l 190 WELSH
Welsh a junior, is extremely fast and a good blocker. Assigned to Les
Richter during most of the Cal-USC game, Lou did a very creditable job.
Garner, a converted guard, has proved extremely apt in his new position.
He helps to make the center of Stanford's offensive line more effective.
EVEN
BONETTI 20li (i'2'a lIG G'2 21G WILLHOITE
Willhoite, a GO-minute man is equally as impressive on offense as on de
lense. Against Army, it was Elmer who was mostly responsible for the suc
cess of USC's inside stuff. Bonetti, who played defense last year, has come
a long way since the beginning of the season. A deadly downfield blocker,
Jack has been a key figure in Stanford's running attack all year.
EVEN
BRODERICK 21G G'l'/a RT G'2 226 WEEKS
Weeks, only a sophomore, has proved himself a powerhouse on offense
this year. Coach Hill expects great things from this boy. Broderick, an
other lineman switched from last year's defensive outfit, is a deadly blocker.
He pulls out well and has good speed for a big man.
EDGE: STANFORD
McCOLL 225 G'4 RE GO 177 STILLWELL
During the season, Don has proved himself a good pass-receiver -and
blocker. A junior, he is extremely fast. McColl, one of the greatest players
in Stanford's history, is our nomination for this year's Heisman Trophy.
A phenomenal pass receiver and a very good blocker. Big Bill is easily the
outstanding lineman in the country today.
STRONG EDGE: STANFORD
KERKORIAN 182 5 11 QB GO 198 SCHNEIDER
Schneider, a two year veteran, fits very well into his role of blocking back
in Jess Hill's single wing. He is the passer when USC shifts into a T. Ker
korian is by far the best quarterback on the Coast this year. He is the lead
ing passer, and an amazing ball handler. He, along with Manoogian and
McColl, should be in line for Ail-American honors this year.
STRONG EDGE: STANFORD
lIUGASIAN 18.1 GO LHB G'l 193 GIFFORD
Gilford is the outstanding tail-back on the Coast. He is the leading
rusher and a very fine single wing tailback in general. He is a strong All-
American candidate. Hugasian has played very fine ball for Stanford for
three years. An extremely smart runner, Harry is not especially fast, but
picks out his holes very well.
STRONG EDGE: USC
COOK 17G s*ll RHB G'O 192 CARMICHAEL
One of the great J.C. prospects in recent years, Carmichael has time and
again proved his worth as a single wing wingback. Fast and powerful, A 1
is one of the outstanding runners on the Coast. Cook, only a sophomore,
got his big chance when Eric Southwood was injured. Although many be
lieve he hasn't reached his full potential yet he is a dangerous and tricky
runner.
EDGE: USC
MATIIIAS 204 6'3 FB G'l 191 SELLERS
Sellers, only a sophomore, is a devastating a blocking back as you could
find. He is a powerful runner with very high knee action. Mathias, a real
"come through" athlete is fast, powerful, and a very good blocker. He gets
those extra yards when they are needed.
EDGE: STANFORD
WEIGHT AVERAGES: STANFORD 201—USC 199
Although USC has better running backs, Stanford's superiority in the
offensive line tends to even up the running attack. Stanford has a great
edge in passing, however, as the Kerkorian-to-McColl combination is im
possible to stop.

Manoogian, named by Chuck Taylor as one of the greatest offensive guards
he has ever seen, is easily the best blocker on the Coast. He is a good All-

Willhoite, a GO-minute man is equally as impressive on offense as on de

a long way since the beginning of the season. A deadly downfield blocker,
Jack has been a key figure in Stanford's running attack all year.

BRODERICK 21G G'l'/a RT G'2 226 WEEKS
Weeks, only a sophomore, has proved himself a powerhouse on offense
this year. Coach Hill expects great things from this boy. Broderick, an

A phenomenal pass receiver and a very good blocker. Big Bill is easily the

KERKORIAN 182 5 11 QB GO 198 SCHNEIDER
Schneider, a two year veteran, fits very well into his role of blocking back
in Jess Hill's single wing. He is the passer when USC shifts into a T. Ker

picks out his holes very well.

those extra yards when they are needed.

WEIGHT AVERAGES: STANFORD 201—USC 199
Although USC has better running backs, Stanford's superiority in the
offensive line tends to even up the running attack. Stanford has a great
edge in passing, however, as the Kerkorian-to-McColl combination is im
possible to stop.

Weeks, only a sophomore, has proved himself a powerhouse on offense
this year. Coach Hill expects great things from this boy. Broderick, an
other lineman switched from last year's defensive outfit, is a deadly blocker.
He pulls out well and has good speed for a big man.
EDGE: STANFORD
McCOLL 225 G'4 RE GO 177 STILLWELL
During the season, Don has proved himself a good pass-receiver -and
blocker. A junior, he is extremely fast. McColl, one of the greatest players
in Stanford's history, is our nomination for this year's Heisman Trophy.
A phenomenal pass receiver and a very good blocker. Big Bill is easily the
outstanding lineman in the country today.
STRONG EDGE: STANFORD
KERKORIAN 182 5 11 QB GO 198 SCHNEIDER
Schneider, a two year veteran, fits very well into his role of blocking back
in Jess Hill's single wing. He is the passer when USC shifts into a T. Ker
korian is by far the best quarterback on the Coast this year. He is the lead
ing passer, and an amazing ball handler. He, along with Manoogian and
McColl, should be in line for Ail-American honors this year.
STRONG EDGE: STANFORD
lIUGASIAN 18.1 GO LHB G'l 193 GIFFORD
Gilford is the outstanding tail-back on the Coast. He is the leading
rusher and a very fine single wing tailback in general. He is a strong All-
American candidate. Hugasian has played very fine ball for Stanford for
three years. An extremely smart runner, Harry is not especially fast, but
picks out his holes very well.
STRONG EDGE: USC
COOK 17G s*ll RHB G'O 192 CARMICHAEL
One of the great J.C. prospects in recent years, Carmichael has time and
again proved his worth as a single wing wingback. Fast and powerful, A 1
is one of the outstanding runners on the Coast. Cook, only a sophomore,
got his big chance when Eric Southwood was injured. Although many be
lieve he hasn't reached his full potential yet he is a dangerous and tricky
runner.
EDGE: USC
MATIIIAS 204 6'3 FB G'l 191 SELLERS
Sellers, only a sophomore, is a devastating a blocking back as you could
find. He is a powerful runner with very high knee action. Mathias, a real
"come through" athlete is fast, powerful, and a very good blocker. He gets
those extra yards when they are needed.
EDGE: STANFORD
WEIGHT AVERAGES: STANFORD 201—USC 199
Although USC has better running backs, Stanford's superiority in the
offensive line tends to even up the running attack. Stanford has a great
edge in passing, however, as the Kerkorian-to-McColl combination is im
possible to stop.

(Today the offensive outfits of both teams will be compared).
Name Wt. lit. P«s. Ili. Wt. Name
STOIIUM 197 G'4 LE (i'l 185 ZIMMERMAN
One of the fastest men on the squad, Zimmerman sometimes doubles as
defensive halfback. A senior, he is a Kood blocker and pass catcher. Storum,
although not as good a pass receiver a;> Zimmerman, is by far the better
blocker. He is. also a speed-burner, running the 440 on the track team.
EDGE: USC
VICK 229 G'3 LT G'O 214 CONDE
Conde, a GO-minute player last year has been relegated to strictly of
fensive duties. lie is probably the best blocking tackle on the Coast. Vick,
who played defensive last year has fit into his offensive role beautifully. Big
and rugged, he is an outstanding blocker.
EDGE: USC
MANOOGIAN 197 51ft LG s'lo 2(15 SANBRANO
A 1 Sanbrano, a junior, is one of Troy's steadiest linemen. Last week
against Army he was particularly effective at pulling out for the wide stuff.
Manoogian, named by Chuck Taylor as one of the greatest offensive guards
he has ever seen, is easily the best blocker on the Coast. He is a good All-
American candidate.
STRONG EDGE: STANFORD
GARNER 195 G'O C G'l 190 WELSH
Welsh a junior, is extremely fast and a good blocker. Assigned to Les
Richter during most of the Cal-USC game, Lou did a very creditable job.
Garner, a converted guard, has proved extremely apt in his new position.
He helps to make the center of Stanford's offensive line more effective.
EVEN
BONETTI 20li (i'2'a lIG G'2 21G WILLHOITE
Willhoite, a GO-minute man is equally as impressive on offense as on de
lense. Against Army, it was Elmer who was mostly responsible for the suc
cess of USC's inside stuff. Bonetti, who played defense last year, has come
a long way since the beginning of the season. A deadly downfield blocker,
Jack has been a key figure in Stanford's running attack all year.
