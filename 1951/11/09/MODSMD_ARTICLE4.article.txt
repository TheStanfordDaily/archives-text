# 'MERCHANT OF VENICE'
## 'A Striking Production But Intent Is Confused' 
### DICK FREDELL 
The Stanford Players last night unveiled a handsome and strik
ing production of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" on
the stage of Memorial Auditorium. What emerges, however,
seems a bit confused in its intent, as though the actors were work-

ing at cross purposes, undecided I
among themselves as to whether 1
they are playing comedy or tragedy.
The trouble springs from Clar
ence Derwent's interpretation of |
Shylock, though our quarrel is not j
with the venerable and gifted actor ,
himself.
Rather, it is with his allegiance (
to the comparatively recent, tradi
tion— one of the few unfortunate j
outgrowths of the laudable cam- i
paigns against racial prejudice—by ;
which Shylock is treated as a sym
pathetic character instead of as the 1
comic villain created by Shake- j
speare.
Made to feel sorry for Shylock,
we are quite horrified by his un
happy fate and the play ceases to
be what Shakespeare intended: a
romantic comedy.
A look at the text will s'jnv
that Shylock is meant to he vil
lainous. His hypocritical opening
lines, for example, give a wicked
impression: while pretending to
consider Antonio's financial
soundness before making the loan.
Shylock is actually hoping that
Antonio will flo bankrupt so that
th? pound of flesh may he col
lected.
As for the famous "Hath not a
•Jew eyes?" speech, mainstay of the
case for a sympathetic Shylock, it
can only be said that Shakespeare
always gives his villains a chance to
plead their causes. Here, in other
words, Shakespeare is merely giv- i
ing the devil his due. Furthermore,
the content of this speech is of vil
lainy and revenge; no scrap what
soever of a nobler side is revealed.
Nor can Shylock be considered a>
an even partially pathetic creation.
For this there is, in his sccnes, too
much of the external comic tech
nique of Elizabethan drama, too
great, a use of such formal comic
devices as repetition and inversion
of words and motifs.
Thus Shylock's fate, horrifying
ly harsh if we sympathize with
him, was meant by Shakespeare
simply to deal the villain his tra
ditionally Mist deserts, leaving the
other characters to rc'oice nnd, in
true romantic fashion, live hap
pily ever after.
Quite apart from his unduly sol
emn interpretation of Shylock.
however, Derwcnt gives what can
unqualifiedly be called an expert
and impressive performance. If we
1 cannot agree with bis conception of

Shylock. we have only applause and
respect for his ability as an actor.
Orchids are also in order for Ad
dyse Lane, who plays Portia with
bewitching verve and sparkle. A
lesser actress mjght have paled in
the considerable shadow cast by !
Derwent's undeniable skill, but
Miss Lane proves herself an equal
| match for him.
Really hitting her stride after
the casket business has been re
solved. she dominates both the
trial and the closing scenes of the
play.
Hugo Melchione, as the Prince
of Morocco, and Arthur H. Fischer,
as the Prince of Arragon, are also
excellent.. Projecting themselves
from their rather minor roles, they
; capture perfectly the light, comic
spirit intended by Shakespeare in
: his writing of the play.
Contributing greatly to the rich
ness and beauty of the production
are Lcnytb Brockett's costumes.
