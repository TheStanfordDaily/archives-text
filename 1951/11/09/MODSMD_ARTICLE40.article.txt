# 'Try A Ten-Point Breakfast Today'
## 
### PHIL BERMAN 
How many times just before class
| have you gone into the Cellar and
! gulped down a doughnut or snail j
| and a cup of coffee for breakfast? ]
If you do, you're not getting an i
j adequate breakfast.
Members of the Hygiene 50 class
! group on nutrition have put up
posters in the Cellar to help you
eat better every day. They have
| worked out a simple point system
| to follow.
"Try a Ten-Point Breakfast To
day," is the slogan they have used.
Underneath this sign are posters
showing what you should eat and
I how many points each item is worth
j toward a ten-point goal.
Why you should eat a better
| breakfast has been stated many
times before by prominent nutri
j tionists. They say that when you
are in school, especially, a good
breakfast helps you to study and
learn better. By the way, what did
you eat for breakfast the day you
had your last mid-term?
In their survey, the nutrition
group took the orders of 128 per
sons eating at the Cellar and com
pared them to the ten-point scale.
The average was not even four j
points.
The next time you go into the
Cellar to eat breakfast, compare j
j your score with the ten-point goal. I


EAT A BETTER BREAKFAST—Putting up the "Try a Ten-Point Breakfast Today" poster in the
Cellar are Jane Perrin and Bill Atchison. This is part of a drive by the Hygiene 50 group on Nutri
tion to improve the breakfasts of the people eating there. The average breakfast, based on the
scale of ten points, is not even four points.—Daily photo by Roger Hagen
