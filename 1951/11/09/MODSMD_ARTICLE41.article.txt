# Dog Saved By Student
## 
### 
The San Francisco Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
is hunting for an unidentified Stan
ford student who rescued a small
Boston terrier from drowning at
Santa Cruz last Sunday.
The dog's owner, Mrs. Marie Ga
hor, of San Bruno, was so excited
at the restoration of her pet that
she neglected to get the name of
its redeemer. The society is desi
rous of presenting him with an
award of merit certificate.
The incident occurred when the
dog, chasing sea gulls to the edge
of a clifT, lost its footing and
plunged into the water below. The
student, out in the bay on a surf
board, was attracted by the shouts
and gesticulations of Mrs. Gabor
from the clifT. He finally managed
to get the dog aboard the surfboard
and restore it to its grateful owner.
