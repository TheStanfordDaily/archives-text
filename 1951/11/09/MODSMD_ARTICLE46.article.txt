# Stanford Research Report Tells of New Atomic Uses
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute has
told the Atomic Energy Commission
that radioactive wastes of atomic
bomb manufacturing have a poten
tially great future in industry.
The news was contained in an
SRI report made public yesterday.
Among the many uses listed were
the following: cold sterilization of
drugs, cannod foods, and fresh veg
etables, portable low-level power
sources, and industrial radiogra
phy.
Millions of tfalions of radioac
tive wastes arc now stored under
ground in concrete vaults by the
AEC.
The SRI study was undertaken at
the request of the AEC. The report
states that full development of the
industrial markets for the waste fis
sion products will be delayed a few
years because of technical and eco
nomic problems.
Paul J. Lovewell, assistant chief
of the SRI industrial economics de

partment directed a lc;im of experts
who consulted with some 150 Amer
ican industrial leaders during the
research.
One of the problems to l>c
solved before the materials can
he used even by the industries
now ready for them is whether
processing plants are to he
financed and operated by the AEC
or private industry.
To encourage further study by
| industry of the possibilities inherent
in use of atomic waste material, the
j AEC has authorized SRI to make
the report available at cost. Copies
