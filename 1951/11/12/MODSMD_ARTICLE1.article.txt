# 8 IN A ROW-FUTURE ROSY
## Clutch Rally Sinks Trojans 
### DICK KLEIN 
Los Angeles Coliseum, Nov. 10—"What can I say about a
I like that? It's the greatest game I have ever seen from the bench,"
i blurted out Chuck Taylor in the dressing room aftermath to his
j greatest victory. There was more teamwork, spirit, and come
! through than any team mo3t of the Coliseum fans had ever seen.
| No one could deny that the Trojans had superior manpower, but
: that wasn't enough to stop the rampaging Cards.
Yes, the Card 3 are definitely stacked this year. They are stacked
I high and deep with that winning spirit, that drive, that resourco
i fulness that it takes to make a winner. They just couldn't be denied.
The Coliseum is now emptied of the 96,130 fans who were lucky enough
; to witness the most thrilling game ever played between two traditional foes.
1 The come-through Indians of Stanford did everything but. tear down the
| goalposts as they tripped up the Trojans of Southern California, 27-20.
All the drama was crammed into a breath-taking fourth quarter. Stan
ford controlled the game in the first half, leading 7 to 0 and missing several
other scoring opportunities. Troy took charge in the third quarter, tied the
game up at 7 to 7, and looked ready to wrap up the whole show. But, all
this only set the stage for the final 15 minutes.
Behind 13 to 14 after General Gary failed on a conversion, all seemed
hopelessly lost as the Trojans came roaring down the big bowl's turf to the
Card 8 and a first down. But the Big Reds dug in and held on a brilliant,
goal line stand on fourth down. Then the crushing fumble and supposedly
the ball game, as the Indians fell behind 13 to 20 when Kcrkorian was racked
in the end zone. Huge Charlie Ane, Troy defensive lineman, fell on the ball
for the score.
At the moment, with time getting short, what looked like a vita! point
was called back on a penalty. The extra 15 yards for holding made Clifford
go wide and the score remains 20 to 13.
Kcrkorian to Morley Highlights Drive
But there were 7V2 minutes yet to be played. There was plenty of fight
in the tired hearts of the Card squad, but time was running out. Then Sam
Morley came in and caught a pass on the 14 to highlight a drive by the red
hot Indians.
A penalty for delaying the game and a great plunge by Mathias brought
the ball to the five. Mathias again to the one-yard line and a first down.
| Again the Tulare flash carries the ball, but this was the payoff. Norm
! Manoogian and Jim Vick. two powerful offensive linemen, led the way
! straight up the middle and the slashing fullback streaked and it was 20 to 19.
i Gary made it this time and it was a tie ball game, 20 to 20.
What next? What else could happen? Only five minutes remained. The
Trojans began to move until Skippy Crist, Chuck Taylor's double-duty re
serve ace, came out of nowhere to intercept an aerial. It was on the 42 and
Crist races to the 12. There was a flag on the play, but it was against Troy.
Here comes the whole ballgame. Mathias, the workhorse, carries to the
10 or better. A quick flip from Gary, who is mixing up plays with real
| brilliance, to Wes Laubscher to the 7. Mathias drives through for a touch
j down and glory.
But the ever-present red hankie was on the ground again. Stanford off
side, third down, ten to go on the 12. Harry Hugasian, the hipster of old,
goes to the one and a first down. Manoogian and Vick are there to open
i the gate. Some thought the squirming Harry had turned the trick, but. not
j the refs.
Hugasian Lowers the Boom
Gary gives to Harry on the same play. It surprises the Trojans, and
| boom! It was the Cards in front once more. Gary oooly converted and it
I was 27 to 20 with tho clock spinning around crazily.
After the kickoff was carried to the 27, Dean Schneider tried a series
! of desperation passes that ended the tough, but vain attempt of the men of
Troy to deny the more-than-dctermined Indian of victory and the right, to
j a rosy future.
I Schneider threw three long, incomplete passes. On fourth down ho
couldn't find a receiver and elected to gamble with a callop up the right
I sidelines. It fell way short, and in came the game, but dog-tired band of
Indians. Gary Kcrkorian, a damn weary Shiskabobcr, ran off a quarterback


"WON'T QUIT" INDIANS SMASH TROY—In photo at left, Bob Mathias packs the leather into
the end zone through a hole over right tackle. This was touchdown number three for Stanford
and was scored midway through the fourth period. Trojan defenders John Williams (29) Bob
Peviani (66) Pat Cannamela (42) and Dean Schneider (19) try vainly to stop Mathias. Gary Ker
korian's conversion seconds later tied the game, 20-20, and the Indians scored a few minutes later


to grab a 27-20 win over USC. In center photo, Big Bill McColl leaps skyward for the pigskin
which shows above the rim of the Coliseum. He caught it. But the referee ruled the catch was
out of bounds and Stanford lost a first quarter tally. Note Pat Cannamela (42) watching help

sneak. No gain, Lut plenty of the precious time eaten up. Another sneak to
the 25. And as Gary fell to the turf on his third time-consumer, the time
keeper's blank boomed the end and curtains to Troy's attempt to deny the
Indians.
Indian rooters still numb with disbelief just screamed with what hoarse
voice was left. No one could say that the magnificent Indians were a Huke
ball club now. Maybe they didn't have the manpower to match a lot of
the nation's top teams, but they had, spirit, poise, moxie, know-how plus.
The "Know-How" Boys
And that's why they have won eight contests in a row and now are so
dangerously close to a Rose Bowl invitation that it could be in the mail right
now. It should be. Who's left? Oregon State and Cal, both toughies. But
don't ever forget that this is the '51 Indian tribe, the Know-How Boys.
No* the How Boys.
The highlights were out of fairybook. Rapid Bob Mathias provided the
longest run and most spine-tingling moment. He grabbed a kickoff on his
own four and in one gallop, with good interference, a key block by Harry
Hugasian, a traffic jam near the 35, and a quick flurry with the sidestripes,
rumbled to the Trojan promised land. Mathias scored another touchdown
on a power play that tied up the game.
Bill McColl, perhaps in his greatest role ever, as decoy, blocker, receiver,
All-American, opened the Card scoring parade. In the first quarter he tore
from the right, headed horizontally down the endzone to snag a perfect peg
from his quarterback, the equally sensational Gary Kerkorian.
So dynamic was the Stanford passing attack that most scouts and writers
from all over the country could hardly talk about anything else. Gary's
massive 218 yards broke a long-standing Southern California single op
ponent passing defense record. He completed a mere 18 out of 32, for a
56 percentage. During the second period, Gary completed nine out of 14, five
in a row at one stretch. His accuracy was amazing, and on the touchdown
flip to big Bill, the ball seemed to weave through the bewildered Troy de
fenders. Another point on the passing attack was that three long gainers
to McColl were nullified, two by penalties and one on a referee's close ruling
of an out-of-bounds catch.
Complete First Half Domination
The Indian domination of the first half was absolutely complete. The
Cards had amassed a neat 166 yards by passing and rushing to the Trojan's
paltry 31. The entire defense had SC bottled up. holding Frank Gifford to
only 28 yards for 13 carries.
One of the most telling factors for the Indian victory was the airtight
pass defense. The terrific trio of Dick Horn, Bobby Thompson, and Don
Sanders allowed only two completions for a total of 21 yards. Three inter
ceptions by the Cards totaled 38 yards return.
The constant inability to penetrate the Indian defense made the Trojans
change tactics and concentrate almost entirely on the ground. They did this
with telling effectiveness in the third and parts of the final canto. All to
gether, Troy rushed for 245 yards.
On the other hand, Chuck Taylor had to tell his team t& throw the ball
more than they've ever done this season. The Trojan rush defense was as
strong as had been predicted and allowed only 71 yards the entire gray
afternoon.
To single out any Stanford player for special honors would be difficult.
Above all else, it was a team victory. It took the teamwork and team spirit
to pull the game out of the fire.
Gary Kerkorian was at his best before the home-town crowd. His calling
and passing were near-perfect. Harry Hugasian ran well, very well. Bob
Mathias scored twice, ran back a kickoff 96 yards, and was unstoppable
when he had to gain the important yardage. Enough said.
McColl — The Effective Decoy
The effectiveness of Bill McColl can never be clearly told. His faking
made most of the running plays work. And he received more close-guarding,
two-manning, and roughing-up than most any ball-player who ever played
in the Coliseum.
Norm Manoogian and Jim Vick were tremendous on the offensive line.
Jack Rye and Ron Eadie were tough on the endplay. Ted Tanner and Chuck
Essegian made stops all afternoon, and Hart Cook was a sensation.
Top come-throughs were, of course, by Sam Morley on the long catch
and by Skip Crist on the beautiful interception. The coaching staff had the
Trojans well-figured and had the Indians well-groomed. Best ot all. Chuck
Taylor, and very deservedly so, is well on his way to "Coach of the Year"
honors.

for the score.
At the moment, with time getting short, what looked like a vita! point
was called back on a penalty. The extra 15 yards for holding made Clifford
go wide and the score remains 20 to 13.
Kcrkorian to Morley Highlights Drive
But there were 7V2 minutes yet to be played. There was plenty of fight
in the tired hearts of the Card squad, but time was running out. Then Sam
Morley came in and caught a pass on the 14 to highlight a drive by the red
hot Indians.
A penalty for delaying the game and a great plunge by Mathias brought
the ball to the five. Mathias again to the one-yard line and a first down.
| Again the Tulare flash carries the ball, but this was the payoff. Norm
! Manoogian and Jim Vick. two powerful offensive linemen, led the way
! straight up the middle and the slashing fullback streaked and it was 20 to 19.
i Gary made it this time and it was a tie ball game, 20 to 20.
What next? What else could happen? Only five minutes remained. The
Trojans began to move until Skippy Crist, Chuck Taylor's double-duty re
serve ace, came out of nowhere to intercept an aerial. It was on the 42 and
Crist races to the 12. There was a flag on the play, but it was against Troy.
Here comes the whole ballgame. Mathias, the workhorse, carries to the
10 or better. A quick flip from Gary, who is mixing up plays with real
| brilliance, to Wes Laubscher to the 7. Mathias drives through for a touch
j down and glory.
But the ever-present red hankie was on the ground again. Stanford off
side, third down, ten to go on the 12. Harry Hugasian, the hipster of old,
goes to the one and a first down. Manoogian and Vick are there to open
i the gate. Some thought the squirming Harry had turned the trick, but. not
j the refs.
Hugasian Lowers the Boom
Gary gives to Harry on the same play. It surprises the Trojans, and
| boom! It was the Cards in front once more. Gary oooly converted and it
I was 27 to 20 with tho clock spinning around crazily.
After the kickoff was carried to the 27, Dean Schneider tried a series
! of desperation passes that ended the tough, but vain attempt of the men of
Troy to deny the more-than-dctermined Indian of victory and the right, to
j a rosy future.
I Schneider threw three long, incomplete passes. On fourth down ho
couldn't find a receiver and elected to gamble with a callop up the right
I sidelines. It fell way short, and in came the game, but dog-tired band of
Indians. Gary Kcrkorian, a damn weary Shiskabobcr, ran off a quarterback


"WON'T QUIT" INDIANS SMASH TROY—In photo at left, Bob Mathias packs the leather into
the end zone through a hole over right tackle. This was touchdown number three for Stanford
and was scored midway through the fourth period. Trojan defenders John Williams (29) Bob
Peviani (66) Pat Cannamela (42) and Dean Schneider (19) try vainly to stop Mathias. Gary Ker
korian's conversion seconds later tied the game, 20-20, and the Indians scored a few minutes later


to grab a 27-20 win over USC. In center photo, Big Bill McColl leaps skyward for the pigskin
which shows above the rim of the Coliseum. He caught it. But the referee ruled the catch was
out of bounds and Stanford lost a first quarter tally. Note Pat Cannamela (42) watching help
lessly. In photo at right McColl (3), guard Norm Manoogian (45) and guard Bob Griffin (15) head

sneak. No gain, Lut plenty of the precious time eaten up. Another sneak to
the 25. And as Gary fell to the turf on his third time-consumer, the time
keeper's blank boomed the end and curtains to Troy's attempt to deny the
Indians.
Indian rooters still numb with disbelief just screamed with what hoarse
voice was left. No one could say that the magnificent Indians were a Huke
ball club now. Maybe they didn't have the manpower to match a lot of
the nation's top teams, but they had, spirit, poise, moxie, know-how plus.
The "Know-How" Boys
And that's why they have won eight contests in a row and now are so
dangerously close to a Rose Bowl invitation that it could be in the mail right
now. It should be. Who's left? Oregon State and Cal, both toughies. But
don't ever forget that this is the '51 Indian tribe, the Know-How Boys.
No* the How Boys.
The highlights were out of fairybook. Rapid Bob Mathias provided the
longest run and most spine-tingling moment. He grabbed a kickoff on his
own four and in one gallop, with good interference, a key block by Harry
Hugasian, a traffic jam near the 35, and a quick flurry with the sidestripes,
rumbled to the Trojan promised land. Mathias scored another touchdown
on a power play that tied up the game.
Bill McColl, perhaps in his greatest role ever, as decoy, blocker, receiver,
All-American, opened the Card scoring parade. In the first quarter he tore
from the right, headed horizontally down the endzone to snag a perfect peg
from his quarterback, the equally sensational Gary Kerkorian.
So dynamic was the Stanford passing attack that most scouts and writers
from all over the country could hardly talk about anything else. Gary's
massive 218 yards broke a long-standing Southern California single op
ponent passing defense record. He completed a mere 18 out of 32, for a
56 percentage. During the second period, Gary completed nine out of 14, five
in a row at one stretch. His accuracy was amazing, and on the touchdown
flip to big Bill, the ball seemed to weave through the bewildered Troy de
fenders. Another point on the passing attack was that three long gainers
to McColl were nullified, two by penalties and one on a referee's close ruling
of an out-of-bounds catch.
Complete First Half Domination
The Indian domination of the first half was absolutely complete. The
Cards had amassed a neat 166 yards by passing and rushing to the Trojan's
paltry 31. The entire defense had SC bottled up. holding Frank Gifford to
only 28 yards for 13 carries.
One of the most telling factors for the Indian victory was the airtight
pass defense. The terrific trio of Dick Horn, Bobby Thompson, and Don
Sanders allowed only two completions for a total of 21 yards. Three inter
ceptions by the Cards totaled 38 yards return.
The constant inability to penetrate the Indian defense made the Trojans
change tactics and concentrate almost entirely on the ground. They did this
with telling effectiveness in the third and parts of the final canto. All to
gether, Troy rushed for 245 yards.
On the other hand, Chuck Taylor had to tell his team t& throw the ball
more than they've ever done this season. The Trojan rush defense was as
strong as had been predicted and allowed only 71 yards the entire gray
afternoon.
To single out any Stanford player for special honors would be difficult.
Above all else, it was a team victory. It took the teamwork and team spirit
to pull the game out of the fire.
Gary Kerkorian was at his best before the home-town crowd. His calling
and passing were near-perfect. Harry Hugasian ran well, very well. Bob
Mathias scored twice, ran back a kickoff 96 yards, and was unstoppable
when he had to gain the important yardage. Enough said.
McColl — The Effective Decoy
The effectiveness of Bill McColl can never be clearly told. His faking
made most of the running plays work. And he received more close-guarding,
two-manning, and roughing-up than most any ball-player who ever played
in the Coliseum.
Norm Manoogian and Jim Vick were tremendous on the offensive line.
Jack Rye and Ron Eadie were tough on the endplay. Ted Tanner and Chuck
Essegian made stops all afternoon, and Hart Cook was a sensation.
Top come-throughs were, of course, by Sam Morley on the long catch
and by Skip Crist on the beautiful interception. The coaching staff had the
Trojans well-figured and had the Indians well-groomed. Best ot all. Chuck
Taylor, and very deservedly so, is well on his way to "Coach of the Year"
honors.
Los Angeles Coliseum, Nov. 10—"What can I say about a
I like that? It's the greatest game I have ever seen from the bench,"
i blurted out Chuck Taylor in the dressing room aftermath to his
j greatest victory. There was more teamwork, spirit, and come

| No one could deny that the Trojans had superior manpower, but
: that wasn't enough to stop the rampaging Cards.
Yes, the Card 3 are definitely stacked this year. They are stacked
I high and deep with that winning spirit, that drive, that resourco
i fulness that it takes to make a winner. They just couldn't be denied.
The Coliseum is now emptied of the 96,130 fans who were lucky enough
; to witness the most thrilling game ever played between two traditional foes.
1 The come-through Indians of Stanford did everything but. tear down the
| goalposts as they tripped up the Trojans of Southern California, 27-20.
All the drama was crammed into a breath-taking fourth quarter. Stan
ford controlled the game in the first half, leading 7 to 0 and missing several
other scoring opportunities. Troy took charge in the third quarter, tied the
game up at 7 to 7, and looked ready to wrap up the whole show. But, all
this only set the stage for the final 15 minutes.
Behind 13 to 14 after General Gary failed on a conversion, all seemed
hopelessly lost as the Trojans came roaring down the big bowl's turf to the
Card 8 and a first down. But the Big Reds dug in and held on a brilliant,
goal line stand on fourth down. Then the crushing fumble and supposedly
the ball game, as the Indians fell behind 13 to 20 when Kcrkorian was racked
in the end zone. Huge Charlie Ane, Troy defensive lineman, fell on the ball
for the score.

"WON'T QUIT" INDIANS SMASH TROY—In photo at left, Bob Mathias packs the leather into
the end zone through a hole over right tackle. This was touchdown number three for Stanford
and was scored midway through the fourth period. Trojan defenders John Williams (29) Bob
Peviani (66) Pat Cannamela (42) and Dean Schneider (19) try vainly to stop Mathias. Gary Ker
korian's conversion seconds later tied the game, 20-20, and the Indians scored a few minutes later


to grab a 27-20 win over USC. In center photo, Big Bill McColl leaps skyward for the pigskin
which shows above the rim of the Coliseum. He caught it. But the referee ruled the catch was
out of bounds and Stanford lost a first quarter tally. Note Pat Cannamela (42) watching help

sneak. No gain, Lut plenty of the precious time eaten up. Another sneak to
the 25. And as Gary fell to the turf on his third time-consumer, the time
keeper's blank boomed the end and curtains to Troy's attempt to deny the
Indians.
Indian rooters still numb with disbelief just screamed with what hoarse
voice was left. No one could say that the magnificent Indians were a Huke
ball club now. Maybe they didn't have the manpower to match a lot of
the nation's top teams, but they had, spirit, poise, moxie, know-how plus.
The "Know-How" Boys
And that's why they have won eight contests in a row and now are so
dangerously close to a Rose Bowl invitation that it could be in the mail right
now. It should be. Who's left? Oregon State and Cal, both toughies. But
don't ever forget that this is the '51 Indian tribe, the Know-How Boys.
No* the How Boys.
The highlights were out of fairybook. Rapid Bob Mathias provided the
longest run and most spine-tingling moment. He grabbed a kickoff on his
own four and in one gallop, with good interference, a key block by Harry
Hugasian, a traffic jam near the 35, and a quick flurry with the sidestripes,
rumbled to the Trojan promised land. Mathias scored another touchdown
on a power play that tied up the game.
Bill McColl, perhaps in his greatest role ever, as decoy, blocker, receiver,
All-American, opened the Card scoring parade. In the first quarter he tore
from the right, headed horizontally down the endzone to snag a perfect peg
from his quarterback, the equally sensational Gary Kerkorian.
So dynamic was the Stanford passing attack that most scouts and writers
from all over the country could hardly talk about anything else. Gary's
massive 218 yards broke a long-standing Southern California single op
ponent passing defense record. He completed a mere 18 out of 32, for a
56 percentage. During the second period, Gary completed nine out of 14, five
in a row at one stretch. His accuracy was amazing, and on the touchdown
flip to big Bill, the ball seemed to weave through the bewildered Troy de
fenders. Another point on the passing attack was that three long gainers
to McColl were nullified, two by penalties and one on a referee's close ruling
of an out-of-bounds catch.
Complete First Half Domination
The Indian domination of the first half was absolutely complete. The
Cards had amassed a neat 166 yards by passing and rushing to the Trojan's
paltry 31. The entire defense had SC bottled up. holding Frank Gifford to
only 28 yards for 13 carries.
One of the most telling factors for the Indian victory was the airtight
pass defense. The terrific trio of Dick Horn, Bobby Thompson, and Don
Sanders allowed only two completions for a total of 21 yards. Three inter
ceptions by the Cards totaled 38 yards return.
The constant inability to penetrate the Indian defense made the Trojans
change tactics and concentrate almost entirely on the ground. They did this
with telling effectiveness in the third and parts of the final canto. All to
gether, Troy rushed for 245 yards.
On the other hand, Chuck Taylor had to tell his team t& throw the ball
more than they've ever done this season. The Trojan rush defense was as
strong as had been predicted and allowed only 71 yards the entire gray
afternoon.
To single out any Stanford player for special honors would be difficult.
Above all else, it was a team victory. It took the teamwork and team spirit
to pull the game out of the fire.
Gary Kerkorian was at his best before the home-town crowd. His calling
and passing were near-perfect. Harry Hugasian ran well, very well. Bob
Mathias scored twice, ran back a kickoff 96 yards, and was unstoppable
when he had to gain the important yardage. Enough said.
McColl — The Effective Decoy
The effectiveness of Bill McColl can never be clearly told. His faking
made most of the running plays work. And he received more close-guarding,
two-manning, and roughing-up than most any ball-player who ever played
in the Coliseum.
Norm Manoogian and Jim Vick were tremendous on the offensive line.
Jack Rye and Ron Eadie were tough on the endplay. Ted Tanner and Chuck
Essegian made stops all afternoon, and Hart Cook was a sensation.
Top come-throughs were, of course, by Sam Morley on the long catch
and by Skip Crist on the beautiful interception. The coaching staff had the
Trojans well-figured and had the Indians well-groomed. Best ot all. Chuck
Taylor, and very deservedly so, is well on his way to "Coach of the Year"
honors.
Los Angeles Coliseum, Nov. 10—"What can I say about a
I like that? It's the greatest game I have ever seen from the bench,"
i blurted out Chuck Taylor in the dressing room aftermath to his
j greatest victory. There was more teamwork, spirit, and come
! through than any team mo3t of the Coliseum fans had ever seen.
| No one could deny that the Trojans had superior manpower, but
: that wasn't enough to stop the rampaging Cards.
Yes, the Card 3 are definitely stacked this year. They are stacked
I high and deep with that winning spirit, that drive, that resourco
i fulness that it takes to make a winner. They just couldn't be denied.
The Coliseum is now emptied of the 96,130 fans who were lucky enough
; to witness the most thrilling game ever played between two traditional foes.
1 The come-through Indians of Stanford did everything but. tear down the
| goalposts as they tripped up the Trojans of Southern California, 27-20.
All the drama was crammed into a breath-taking fourth quarter. Stan
ford controlled the game in the first half, leading 7 to 0 and missing several
other scoring opportunities. Troy took charge in the third quarter, tied the
game up at 7 to 7, and looked ready to wrap up the whole show. But, all
this only set the stage for the final 15 minutes.
Behind 13 to 14 after General Gary failed on a conversion, all seemed
hopelessly lost as the Trojans came roaring down the big bowl's turf to the
Card 8 and a first down. But the Big Reds dug in and held on a brilliant,
goal line stand on fourth down. Then the crushing fumble and supposedly
the ball game, as the Indians fell behind 13 to 20 when Kcrkorian was racked
in the end zone. Huge Charlie Ane, Troy defensive lineman, fell on the ball
for the score.
At the moment, with time getting short, what looked like a vita! point
was called back on a penalty. The extra 15 yards for holding made Clifford
go wide and the score remains 20 to 13.
Kcrkorian to Morley Highlights Drive
But there were 7V2 minutes yet to be played. There was plenty of fight
in the tired hearts of the Card squad, but time was running out. Then Sam
Morley came in and caught a pass on the 14 to highlight a drive by the red
hot Indians.
A penalty for delaying the game and a great plunge by Mathias brought
the ball to the five. Mathias again to the one-yard line and a first down.
| Again the Tulare flash carries the ball, but this was the payoff. Norm
! Manoogian and Jim Vick. two powerful offensive linemen, led the way
! straight up the middle and the slashing fullback streaked and it was 20 to 19.
i Gary made it this time and it was a tie ball game, 20 to 20.
What next? What else could happen? Only five minutes remained. The
Trojans began to move until Skippy Crist, Chuck Taylor's double-duty re
serve ace, came out of nowhere to intercept an aerial. It was on the 42 and
Crist races to the 12. There was a flag on the play, but it was against Troy.
Here comes the whole ballgame. Mathias, the workhorse, carries to the
10 or better. A quick flip from Gary, who is mixing up plays with real
| brilliance, to Wes Laubscher to the 7. Mathias drives through for a touch
j down and glory.
But the ever-present red hankie was on the ground again. Stanford off

sneak. No gain, Lut plenty of the precious time eaten up. Another sneak to
the 25. And as Gary fell to the turf on his third time-consumer, the time
keeper's blank boomed the end and curtains to Troy's attempt to deny the
Indians.
Indian rooters still numb with disbelief just screamed with what hoarse
voice was left. No one could say that the magnificent Indians were a Huke
ball club now. Maybe they didn't have the manpower to match a lot of
the nation's top teams, but they had, spirit, poise, moxie, know-how plus.
The "Know-How" Boys
And that's why they have won eight contests in a row and now are so
dangerously close to a Rose Bowl invitation that it could be in the mail right
now. It should be. Who's left? Oregon State and Cal, both toughies. But
don't ever forget that this is the '51 Indian tribe, the Know-How Boys.
No* the How Boys.
The highlights were out of fairybook. Rapid Bob Mathias provided the
longest run and most spine-tingling moment. He grabbed a kickoff on his
own four and in one gallop, with good interference, a key block by Harry
Hugasian, a traffic jam near the 35, and a quick flurry with the sidestripes,
rumbled to the Trojan promised land. Mathias scored another touchdown
on a power play that tied up the game.
Bill McColl, perhaps in his greatest role ever, as decoy, blocker, receiver,
All-American, opened the Card scoring parade. In the first quarter he tore
from the right, headed horizontally down the endzone to snag a perfect peg
from his quarterback, the equally sensational Gary Kerkorian.
So dynamic was the Stanford passing attack that most scouts and writers
from all over the country could hardly talk about anything else. Gary's
massive 218 yards broke a long-standing Southern California single op
ponent passing defense record. He completed a mere 18 out of 32, for a
56 percentage. During the second period, Gary completed nine out of 14, five
in a row at one stretch. His accuracy was amazing, and on the touchdown
flip to big Bill, the ball seemed to weave through the bewildered Troy de
fenders. Another point on the passing attack was that three long gainers
to McColl were nullified, two by penalties and one on a referee's close ruling
of an out-of-bounds catch.
Complete First Half Domination
The Indian domination of the first half was absolutely complete. The
Cards had amassed a neat 166 yards by passing and rushing to the Trojan's
paltry 31. The entire defense had SC bottled up. holding Frank Gifford to
only 28 yards for 13 carries.
One of the most telling factors for the Indian victory was the airtight
pass defense. The terrific trio of Dick Horn, Bobby Thompson, and Don
Sanders allowed only two completions for a total of 21 yards. Three inter
ceptions by the Cards totaled 38 yards return.
The constant inability to penetrate the Indian defense made the Trojans
change tactics and concentrate almost entirely on the ground. They did this
with telling effectiveness in the third and parts of the final canto. All to
gether, Troy rushed for 245 yards.
On the other hand, Chuck Taylor had to tell his team t& throw the ball
more than they've ever done this season. The Trojan rush defense was as
strong as had been predicted and allowed only 71 yards the entire gray
afternoon.
To single out any Stanford player for special honors would be difficult.
Above all else, it was a team victory. It took the teamwork and team spirit
to pull the game out of the fire.
Gary Kerkorian was at his best before the home-town crowd. His calling
and passing were near-perfect. Harry Hugasian ran well, very well. Bob
Mathias scored twice, ran back a kickoff 96 yards, and was unstoppable
when he had to gain the important yardage. Enough said.
McColl — The Effective Decoy
The effectiveness of Bill McColl can never be clearly told. His faking
made most of the running plays work. And he received more close-guarding,
two-manning, and roughing-up than most any ball-player who ever played
in the Coliseum.
Norm Manoogian and Jim Vick were tremendous on the offensive line.
Jack Rye and Ron Eadie were tough on the endplay. Ted Tanner and Chuck
Essegian made stops all afternoon, and Hart Cook was a sensation.
Top come-throughs were, of course, by Sam Morley on the long catch
and by Skip Crist on the beautiful interception. The coaching staff had the
Trojans well-figured and had the Indians well-groomed. Best ot all. Chuck
Taylor, and very deservedly so, is well on his way to "Coach of the Year"
honors.
Los Angeles Coliseum, Nov. 10—"What can I say about a
I like that? It's the greatest game I have ever seen from the bench,"
i blurted out Chuck Taylor in the dressing room aftermath to his
j greatest victory. There was more teamwork, spirit, and come
! through than any team mo3t of the Coliseum fans had ever seen.
| No one could deny that the Trojans had superior manpower, but
: that wasn't enough to stop the rampaging Cards.
Yes, the Card 3 are definitely stacked this year. They are stacked
I high and deep with that winning spirit, that drive, that resourco
i fulness that it takes to make a winner. They just couldn't be denied.
The Coliseum is now emptied of the 96,130 fans who were lucky enough
; to witness the most thrilling game ever played between two traditional foes.
1 The come-through Indians of Stanford did everything but. tear down the
| goalposts as they tripped up the Trojans of Southern California, 27-20.
All the drama was crammed into a breath-taking fourth quarter. Stan
ford controlled the game in the first half, leading 7 to 0 and missing several
other scoring opportunities. Troy took charge in the third quarter, tied the
game up at 7 to 7, and looked ready to wrap up the whole show. But, all
this only set the stage for the final 15 minutes.
Behind 13 to 14 after General Gary failed on a conversion, all seemed
hopelessly lost as the Trojans came roaring down the big bowl's turf to the
Card 8 and a first down. But the Big Reds dug in and held on a brilliant,
goal line stand on fourth down. Then the crushing fumble and supposedly
the ball game, as the Indians fell behind 13 to 20 when Kcrkorian was racked
in the end zone. Huge Charlie Ane, Troy defensive lineman, fell on the ball
for the score.
At the moment, with time getting short, what looked like a vita! point
was called back on a penalty. The extra 15 yards for holding made Clifford
go wide and the score remains 20 to 13.
Kcrkorian to Morley Highlights Drive
But there were 7V2 minutes yet to be played. There was plenty of fight
in the tired hearts of the Card squad, but time was running out. Then Sam
Morley came in and caught a pass on the 14 to highlight a drive by the red
hot Indians.
A penalty for delaying the game and a great plunge by Mathias brought
the ball to the five. Mathias again to the one-yard line and a first down.
| Again the Tulare flash carries the ball, but this was the payoff. Norm
! Manoogian and Jim Vick. two powerful offensive linemen, led the way
! straight up the middle and the slashing fullback streaked and it was 20 to 19.
i Gary made it this time and it was a tie ball game, 20 to 20.
What next? What else could happen? Only five minutes remained. The
Trojans began to move until Skippy Crist, Chuck Taylor's double-duty re
serve ace, came out of nowhere to intercept an aerial. It was on the 42 and
Crist races to the 12. There was a flag on the play, but it was against Troy.
Here comes the whole ballgame. Mathias, the workhorse, carries to the
10 or better. A quick flip from Gary, who is mixing up plays with real
| brilliance, to Wes Laubscher to the 7. Mathias drives through for a touch
j down and glory.
But the ever-present red hankie was on the ground again. Stanford off
side, third down, ten to go on the 12. Harry Hugasian, the hipster of old,
goes to the one and a first down. Manoogian and Vick are there to open
i the gate. Some thought the squirming Harry had turned the trick, but. not
j the refs.
Hugasian Lowers the Boom
Gary gives to Harry on the same play. It surprises the Trojans, and
| boom! It was the Cards in front once more. Gary oooly converted and it
I was 27 to 20 with tho clock spinning around crazily.
After the kickoff was carried to the 27, Dean Schneider tried a series
! of desperation passes that ended the tough, but vain attempt of the men of
Troy to deny the more-than-dctermined Indian of victory and the right, to
j a rosy future.
I Schneider threw three long, incomplete passes. On fourth down ho
couldn't find a receiver and elected to gamble with a callop up the right
I sidelines. It fell way short, and in came the game, but dog-tired band of
Indians. Gary Kcrkorian, a damn weary Shiskabobcr, ran off a quarterback

hopelessly lost as the Trojans came roaring down the big bowl's turf to the
Card 8 and a first down. But the Big Reds dug in and held on a brilliant,
goal line stand on fourth down. Then the crushing fumble and supposedly
the ball game, as the Indians fell behind 13 to 20 when Kcrkorian was racked
in the end zone. Huge Charlie Ane, Troy defensive lineman, fell on the ball
for the score.
At the moment, with time getting short, what looked like a vita! point
was called back on a penalty. The extra 15 yards for holding made Clifford
go wide and the score remains 20 to 13.
Kcrkorian to Morley Highlights Drive
But there were 7V2 minutes yet to be played. There was plenty of fight
in the tired hearts of the Card squad, but time was running out. Then Sam
Morley came in and caught a pass on the 14 to highlight a drive by the red
hot Indians.
A penalty for delaying the game and a great plunge by Mathias brought
the ball to the five. Mathias again to the one-yard line and a first down.
| Again the Tulare flash carries the ball, but this was the payoff. Norm
! Manoogian and Jim Vick. two powerful offensive linemen, led the way
! straight up the middle and the slashing fullback streaked and it was 20 to 19.
i Gary made it this time and it was a tie ball game, 20 to 20.
What next? What else could happen? Only five minutes remained. The
Trojans began to move until Skippy Crist, Chuck Taylor's double-duty re
serve ace, came out of nowhere to intercept an aerial. It was on the 42 and
Crist races to the 12. There was a flag on the play, but it was against Troy.
Here comes the whole ballgame. Mathias, the workhorse, carries to the
10 or better. A quick flip from Gary, who is mixing up plays with real
| brilliance, to Wes Laubscher to the 7. Mathias drives through for a touch
j down and glory.
But the ever-present red hankie was on the ground again. Stanford off
side, third down, ten to go on the 12. Harry Hugasian, the hipster of old,
goes to the one and a first down. Manoogian and Vick are there to open
i the gate. Some thought the squirming Harry had turned the trick, but. not
j the refs.
Hugasian Lowers the Boom
Gary gives to Harry on the same play. It surprises the Trojans, and
| boom! It was the Cards in front once more. Gary oooly converted and it
I was 27 to 20 with tho clock spinning around crazily.
After the kickoff was carried to the 27, Dean Schneider tried a series
! of desperation passes that ended the tough, but vain attempt of the men of
Troy to deny the more-than-dctermined Indian of victory and the right, to
j a rosy future.
I Schneider threw three long, incomplete passes. On fourth down ho
couldn't find a receiver and elected to gamble with a callop up the right
I sidelines. It fell way short, and in came the game, but dog-tired band of
Indians. Gary Kcrkorian, a damn weary Shiskabobcr, ran off a quarterback


"WON'T QUIT" INDIANS SMASH TROY—In photo at left, Bob Mathias packs the leather into
the end zone through a hole over right tackle. This was touchdown number three for Stanford
and was scored midway through the fourth period. Trojan defenders John Williams (29) Bob
Peviani (66) Pat Cannamela (42) and Dean Schneider (19) try vainly to stop Mathias. Gary Ker
korian's conversion seconds later tied the game, 20-20, and the Indians scored a few minutes later


to grab a 27-20 win over USC. In center photo, Big Bill McColl leaps skyward for the pigskin
which shows above the rim of the Coliseum. He caught it. But the referee ruled the catch was
out of bounds and Stanford lost a first quarter tally. Note Pat Cannamela (42) watching help
lessly. In photo at right McColl (3), guard Norm Manoogian (45) and guard Bob Griffin (15) head

sneak. No gain, Lut plenty of the precious time eaten up. Another sneak to
the 25. And as Gary fell to the turf on his third time-consumer, the time
keeper's blank boomed the end and curtains to Troy's attempt to deny the
Indians.
Indian rooters still numb with disbelief just screamed with what hoarse
voice was left. No one could say that the magnificent Indians were a Huke
ball club now. Maybe they didn't have the manpower to match a lot of
the nation's top teams, but they had, spirit, poise, moxie, know-how plus.
The "Know-How" Boys
And that's why they have won eight contests in a row and now are so
dangerously close to a Rose Bowl invitation that it could be in the mail right
now. It should be. Who's left? Oregon State and Cal, both toughies. But
don't ever forget that this is the '51 Indian tribe, the Know-How Boys.
No* the How Boys.
The highlights were out of fairybook. Rapid Bob Mathias provided the
longest run and most spine-tingling moment. He grabbed a kickoff on his
own four and in one gallop, with good interference, a key block by Harry
Hugasian, a traffic jam near the 35, and a quick flurry with the sidestripes,
rumbled to the Trojan promised land. Mathias scored another touchdown
on a power play that tied up the game.
Bill McColl, perhaps in his greatest role ever, as decoy, blocker, receiver,
All-American, opened the Card scoring parade. In the first quarter he tore
from the right, headed horizontally down the endzone to snag a perfect peg
from his quarterback, the equally sensational Gary Kerkorian.
So dynamic was the Stanford passing attack that most scouts and writers
from all over the country could hardly talk about anything else. Gary's
massive 218 yards broke a long-standing Southern California single op
ponent passing defense record. He completed a mere 18 out of 32, for a
56 percentage. During the second period, Gary completed nine out of 14, five
in a row at one stretch. His accuracy was amazing, and on the touchdown
flip to big Bill, the ball seemed to weave through the bewildered Troy de
fenders. Another point on the passing attack was that three long gainers
to McColl were nullified, two by penalties and one on a referee's close ruling
of an out-of-bounds catch.
Complete First Half Domination
The Indian domination of the first half was absolutely complete. The
Cards had amassed a neat 166 yards by passing and rushing to the Trojan's
paltry 31. The entire defense had SC bottled up. holding Frank Gifford to
only 28 yards for 13 carries.
One of the most telling factors for the Indian victory was the airtight
pass defense. The terrific trio of Dick Horn, Bobby Thompson, and Don
Sanders allowed only two completions for a total of 21 yards. Three inter
ceptions by the Cards totaled 38 yards return.
The constant inability to penetrate the Indian defense made the Trojans
change tactics and concentrate almost entirely on the ground. They did this
with telling effectiveness in the third and parts of the final canto. All to
gether, Troy rushed for 245 yards.
On the other hand, Chuck Taylor had to tell his team t& throw the ball
more than they've ever done this season. The Trojan rush defense was as
strong as had been predicted and allowed only 71 yards the entire gray
afternoon.
To single out any Stanford player for special honors would be difficult.
Above all else, it was a team victory. It took the teamwork and team spirit
to pull the game out of the fire.
Gary Kerkorian was at his best before the home-town crowd. His calling
and passing were near-perfect. Harry Hugasian ran well, very well. Bob
Mathias scored twice, ran back a kickoff 96 yards, and was unstoppable
when he had to gain the important yardage. Enough said.
McColl — The Effective Decoy
The effectiveness of Bill McColl can never be clearly told. His faking
made most of the running plays work. And he received more close-guarding,
two-manning, and roughing-up than most any ball-player who ever played
in the Coliseum.
Norm Manoogian and Jim Vick were tremendous on the offensive line.
Jack Rye and Ron Eadie were tough on the endplay. Ted Tanner and Chuck
Essegian made stops all afternoon, and Hart Cook was a sensation.
Top come-throughs were, of course, by Sam Morley on the long catch
and by Skip Crist on the beautiful interception. The coaching staff had the
Trojans well-figured and had the Indians well-groomed. Best ot all. Chuck
Taylor, and very deservedly so, is well on his way to "Coach of the Year"
honors.

Los Angeles Coliseum, Nov. 10—"What can I say about a
I like that? It's the greatest game I have ever seen from the bench,"
i blurted out Chuck Taylor in the dressing room aftermath to his
j greatest victory. There was more teamwork, spirit, and come
! through than any team mo3t of the Coliseum fans had ever seen.
| No one could deny that the Trojans had superior manpower, but
: that wasn't enough to stop the rampaging Cards.
Yes, the Card 3 are definitely stacked this year. They are stacked
I high and deep with that winning spirit, that drive, that resourco
i fulness that it takes to make a winner. They just couldn't be denied.
The Coliseum is now emptied of the 96,130 fans who were lucky enough
; to witness the most thrilling game ever played between two traditional foes.
1 The come-through Indians of Stanford did everything but. tear down the
| goalposts as they tripped up the Trojans of Southern California, 27-20.
All the drama was crammed into a breath-taking fourth quarter. Stan
ford controlled the game in the first half, leading 7 to 0 and missing several
other scoring opportunities. Troy took charge in the third quarter, tied the
game up at 7 to 7, and looked ready to wrap up the whole show. But, all
this only set the stage for the final 15 minutes.
