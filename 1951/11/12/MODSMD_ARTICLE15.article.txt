# ROOTERS—HERE AND THERE
## Throughout Contest, It's Pandemonium 
### DICK CARTER 
Pandemonium, hysteria, and
depression raged through Ros
sotti's Saturday afternoon as the
loudspeaker blared out the for
tunes of the Cardinal football
team to the shivering rooters
standing and sitting tensely
around the park.
At the beginning of the fourth
quarter when the Trojans made
their tremendous bid, the attitude
of the crowd changed from jubila
tion to apprehension, and finally re
solved itself in quiet comments and
wrinkled brows as bottles were
emptied a little faster.
At one table a student picked
up a bottle and disgustedly threw
it down with a few choice com
ments about the "great second
half team from Los Angeles," but
by and large the rooters Mist hud
dled a little closer and crossed
their fingers dejectedly.
As the third Stanford touchdown
drive progressed, the rooters gath
ered apprehensively around the
round truck and began shaking
Ro.ssotti's signboard as if 1o signify
the crumpling of the Trojan de
fense.
And then as Crist intercepted
Gilford's pass, the crowd went wild.
Bottles were thrown and tables
overturned as the rooters danced,
hugged, and shook each other in
glee.
In one final, symbolic motion
Rossotti's sign was broken down
as the Stanforditcs stood, damp
but happy, waiting for the final
gun.
With the ending of the game car
horns started blowing all over the
campus, the bedlam continuing for
nearly an hour.
In Encina dining hall well-Ros
sotted Indians were led in Stanford
cheers by a self-appointed cheer
leader standing on a table. Knives
and forks crashed against the table
tops in rhythm until the chandeliers
started shaking.
Then everyone rose to his feet
and began singing the Alma Ma
ter.
Celebrations carried over into
Restaurant Row. At L'Ommie's the
toasting of the Indian team didn't
cease until the curfew called a halt
to it at 2 o'clock, with students,
alumni, and just plain well-wishers
all joining in.
Otherwise, it was a dead Stanford
campus over the weekend for the
few who stuck around. Cellar busi
ness fell off drastically; the cigar
store in the Cellar ln»d few cus
tomers (execpt thore who bought
the Sunday papers, which sold fast);
and the libraries were all hut de
serted.
Football fever hit h pitch thai
was too high for even the Cellar
bees. They took off en masse for
the ,«outh, hut flew back yesterday
and were on hand to meet the team.

There was plenty of whooping
it up for the biggest exodus of
Stanford rooters ever to go south
to a PCC game in Los Angeles.
The advance guard of the 4,000-
strong Indian caravan had a
chance to meet the Card team
when they pulled into the air
port Friday afternoon at Lock
heed Terminal.
On the eve of tho great victory
Rally Com staged a rally in Lafa
yette Park which was attended by
over 4,000 students and friends.
Across the street from the rally was
the plush Town House which was
thrown open to the Stanford
throngs.
In the Zebra Room there was a
combo, a tiny dance floor, and
crowded drinking accommoda
tions. Outside on the patio many
enjoyed the chilly evening dancing
to piped music.
Earlier in the evening, the South
ern Cal students displayed their
Homecoming Week float entries
along the Miracle Mile of Wilshire
Boulevard. The huge, colorful ex- 1
hibits brought lots of "oh's" and
"ah's" from the crowds that lined
the street to .see them first-hand and
by those who watchod the parade
over television.
Most of the after - the - victory
celebrating was done at small
house parties all over the Los An
geles area. There was no one big
shindig. Members of the team
separated, met with their families,
and had the evening oIT with some
long-sought free time.
Yesterday the students began to I
collect themselves "together and
make plans for tho return trip. Air
lines and highways were crowded i

strong Indian caravan had a
chance to meet the Card team
when they pulled into the air
port Friday afternoon at Lock
heed Terminal.
On the eve of tho great victory
Rally Com staged a rally in Lafa
yette Park which was attended by
over 4,000 students and friends.
Across the street from the rally was
the plush Town House which was
thrown open to the Stanford
throngs.
In the Zebra Room there was a
combo, a tiny dance floor, and
crowded drinking accommoda
tions. Outside on the patio many
enjoyed the chilly evening dancing
to piped music.
Earlier in the evening, the South
ern Cal students displayed their
Homecoming Week float entries
along the Miracle Mile of Wilshire
Boulevard. The huge, colorful ex- 1
hibits brought lots of "oh's" and
"ah's" from the crowds that lined
the street to .see them first-hand and
by those who watchod the parade
over television.
Most of the after - the - victory
celebrating was done at small
house parties all over the Los An
geles area. There was no one big
shindig. Members of the team
separated, met with their families,
and had the evening oIT with some
long-sought free time.
Yesterday the students began to I
collect themselves "together and
make plans for tho return trip. Air
lines and highways were crowded i
with Stanford traffic.
Pandemonium, hysteria, and
depression raged through Ros
sotti's Saturday afternoon as the
loudspeaker blared out the for
tunes of the Cardinal football
team to the shivering rooters
standing and sitting tensely
around the park.
At the beginning of the fourth
quarter when the Trojans made
their tremendous bid, the attitude
of the crowd changed from jubila
tion to apprehension, and finally re
solved itself in quiet comments and
wrinkled brows as bottles were
emptied a little faster.
At one table a student picked
up a bottle and disgustedly threw
it down with a few choice com
ments about the "great second
half team from Los Angeles," but
by and large the rooters Mist hud
dled a little closer and crossed
their fingers dejectedly.
As the third Stanford touchdown
drive progressed, the rooters gath
ered apprehensively around the
round truck and began shaking
Ro.ssotti's signboard as if 1o signify
the crumpling of the Trojan de
fense.
And then as Crist intercepted
Gilford's pass, the crowd went wild.
Bottles were thrown and tables
overturned as the rooters danced,
hugged, and shook each other in
glee.
In one final, symbolic motion
Rossotti's sign was broken down
as the Stanforditcs stood, damp
but happy, waiting for the final
gun.
With the ending of the game car
horns started blowing all over the
campus, the bedlam continuing for
nearly an hour.
In Encina dining hall well-Ros
sotted Indians were led in Stanford
cheers by a self-appointed cheer
leader standing on a table. Knives
and forks crashed against the table
tops in rhythm until the chandeliers
started shaking.
Then everyone rose to his feet
and began singing the Alma Ma
ter.
Celebrations carried over into
Restaurant Row. At L'Ommie's the
toasting of the Indian team didn't
cease until the curfew called a halt
to it at 2 o'clock, with students,
alumni, and just plain well-wishers
all joining in.
Otherwise, it was a dead Stanford
campus over the weekend for the
few who stuck around. Cellar busi
ness fell off drastically; the cigar
store in the Cellar ln»d few cus
tomers (execpt thore who bought
the Sunday papers, which sold fast);
and the libraries were all hut de
serted.
Football fever hit h pitch thai
was too high for even the Cellar
bees. They took off en masse for
the ,«outh, hut flew back yesterday
and were on hand to meet the team.

There was plenty of whooping
it up for the biggest exodus of
Stanford rooters ever to go south
to a PCC game in Los Angeles.
