# BULL SESSION
## HAIL THE GREATEST COME THROUGH GANG EVER! 
### PETE GROTHE 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM. Nov. 10 — I'm up in
the Coliseum pressbox now. Sports scribes from all
over the country are beginning to piece together the
lead paragraphs to stories on the most spectacular
game they've ever seen. And in the gathering dusk
down on the field a completely exhausted but de
leriously happy Stanford team is carrying Chuck Tay
lor and Dutch Fehring on its shoulders. There can be
no doubt now that the red-and-white clad squad just
now going through the tunnel has a distinct touch ol
yreatness in it.

Stanford can win or lose the
next two games and the Rose
Bowl. Right now, it doesn't make
any difference to the thousands of
looters who are swarming to the
USC side of the field. The game
which the electric scoreboard at
the end of the stadium says Stan
lord won, 27 to 20, was the alpha
and omega of grid thrills. The
96,000 who sat in this massive
coliseum saw one of the great foot-

ball contests of all time, and even the Big Game wiil
be anti-climactic.
It's supposed to be my job to throw together the
best possible combination of words to describe some
thing. but for the first time in my life. I find myself
virtually speechless. I'm limp.
What is there you can say about a gang like that?
Throw the dictionary at them, and you still couldn't
do that Herculean come-through effort justice.
What is there you can say about a guy like Kerkor
ian? He was given a terrific physical beating by the
giant USC linemen and almost was the goat of the
game as he fumbled to a Trojan touchdown and missed

an extra point. Then he climbed off the ropes, found
Southern Cal defense weaknesses, and picked away at
them unmercifully and utterly successfully. The team
awarded him the game ball for the All-American ball
he played today.
What can you say about a guy like Co-captain
Jesse Cone, who didn't play much because of an in
jured knee, but who said to me. "Next time, please
put Cappy Cook's name in the starting lineup instead
of me. lie's been playing terrific ball and hasn't got
much notice." Cone played a great psychological
role today. When he wasn't in the game, he was en
couraging the other players on the bench and telling
them that the game COULI) be won. To me, Jesse
Cone typifies the Stanford Spirit and all that's good
and fine on this 1051 team.
What can you say about Bob Mathias, who played
the whole game with a pulled leg muscle? Still a
neophyte as far as playing experience is eoncered he
showed that great heart and endurance that won him
the world's decathalon title at the age of 17 as he zipped

!)(! yards goalward, not on luck but on utter skill. 1
could almost feel Mathias's muscles ripple as he dug
his cleats into the soft, green turf, churning past three
Troy tacklers.
What can you say about Bill McColl, except that
lie's the best college football player in America today.
What can you say about Dick Horn, who in my book
was an All-American defender and punter today.
Johnny Williams, SC's speed-merchant halfback, re
turned the opening kick-off and would have gone all
the way if it weren't for Horn's sure tackling. Half
Al Carmichael was a sure thing to go the distance in
the second half. He had a clear field, except for Horn,
and there was a blocker to take care of him. The
blocker moved into Horn, but Dick wouldn't commit
himself. Finally the blocker took one terrific lunge,
but Horn cleverly sidestepped him. Carmichael gave
the Stanford defender every twist and feint he knew,
but Horn nailed him with a leg tackle and prevented
a USC score. Southern California would be an un
defeated team today if it weren't for Dick Horn.
What can you say about Jack Rye. who made many
unbelievable stops despite the fact he had a serious
case of poison oak and was miserable the whole
game. And about Harry Hugasian, who broke up
the game with I;is runs and pass catches, despite the
fact he ran on a broken toe. And about come-through
artists Sam Morley and Skip Crist.
What can you say about that great defensive out
fit, that after the axe-yell, did the unheard-of by
stopping those USC mooses cold on the goal line.
Thank Chuck Essegian. Al Kirkland, Hart Cook, and
Ron Eadie for that.
What can you say about Chuck Taylor and his
brilliant and personable coaching stall'. An example
of how coaching wins games: Fehring noticed that
Ted Tanner was tiring and suggested that Crist go
in the fray. Crist only had five minutes of defensive
experience all year, but what did he do? Nothing
less than intercept a crucial pass that led to the
Indian's winning touchdown. Taylor, to my way of
thinking, is a cinch for "coach of the year."
What can you say about brutish blockers like Man
oogian, Bonetti, Vick, Garner, Tobin, Storum, Brode
rick who protected for Kerkorian when it counted and
opened up the holes when it counted. And how can
you leave out clutch performers like Ron Cook, play
ing with a bad cold, booming Bob Meyers, Wes Laub
scher, and Bob Hoegh. And how about Bobby Thomp
son and Don Sanders, who along with Horn compose
by far the best defensive backfield on the coast. And
how can you leave out names like Leon King, Bob
Latham, Win Wedge. Ted Tanner, Chuck Hokanson,
Dave Worley, and Bob Griffin. They were all great,
every one of them.
It's dark now in the Coliseum. Only the clicking of
typewriter keys break the ghostly silence. In the
stadium below, janitors are cleaning up the debris and
kids are running around, picking up discarded pro
grams. The gardeners are smoothing the turf and pre
paring it for tomorrow's Rams' game.
Yes. Ibis giant Coliseum is muted and empty now,
but as long «ms I live I'll always remember this most
prodigious come-through effort performed by a Cin
derella team that wouldn't and couldn't he denied
on the field below.
