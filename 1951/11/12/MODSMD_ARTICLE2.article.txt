### 
PARIS, Nov. 11 (UP)â€”British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden
will step back into the international spotlight tomorrow and ask
Russia to take a long second look at the Western disarmament
proposal.
Eden will make his first important speech as Foreign Secretary

nnd will give the West's first answer |
to the blunt Soviet rejection of an !
arms cut plan which Soviet Foreign j
Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky said j
kept him awake all night laughing.
Eden is expected to tell the So- !
viets that, the Western proposal is
no laughing matter and that, the !
Kremlin should take a serious sec- \
ond look at a plan which could I
bring peace to the world. At the |
same time, he will make it clear i
that the Western powers intend to ;
continue building up their defenses j
until Russia indicates a sincere de- j
sire to talk peace.
