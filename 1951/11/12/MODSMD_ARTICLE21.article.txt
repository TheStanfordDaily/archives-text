## A 						Sad Ending for the 'Red Streak' 
### 
To the Editor:
The Red Streak *.v«s r.ot « beautiful bicycle, but it
brougb' its owner to eight s/Ylock classes in time. It
w.'S a collapsible nv»del, folding down to the size of the
" heel; .ind it had i fenders and rusty, but still
sturdy handlebars. It was equipped with a rather
dilapidated canv;tp b?*sket which, though ripped and
v/orn. held books in place and even kept them dry at
times. Despite its burned out globe, a light sat proudly
on the front fender.
The first academic week of the quarter someone
borrowed the Red Streak from its outdoor garage in
liable Woods. It was hardly ever padlocked, because

its owner had strange ideas on the honesty and in
tegrity of the Stanford student—the student whose
non-academic life is governed by one paragraph, the
Fundamental Standard.
The Red Streak is in the hospital now. It was found
outside Encina Cellar last week. Its spokes are badly
bent; three ot them are broken. The handlebar base
is mangled almo:;t beyond repair. The canvas basket
is gone; the light chewed half off.
The Red Streak may recuperate if given enough
time and money. Its owner's pride in the Stanford
student's consideration for the property of others is in
critical condition.
