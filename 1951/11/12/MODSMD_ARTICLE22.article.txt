from time to time in The Daily.)
Florence, Nov. 2. The impressions—l believe that
is what they are called—of an American student who
has landed in this city where they invented art are
inevitably diffuse and by all means overwhelming.
Perhaps the best way to put them in order and into
a few words is by contrasting that which I think is
true with that which Ls generally pre-conceived, and
may or may nyt be true. Thus:
I. The Italians are fiery-tempered, volatile wind
mills.
Not exactly. The less refined citizens are given to
talking (but not like the French) and acting at the
.-amc time. It is definitely ham stuff, but not bad, con
sidering. However, they are not maniacs, at least not
as far north as Florence, but are enthusiasts and ex-
I roverts.
They lack that moribund secretiveness of the Nor
dic peoples, but are just as "solid" a race as any crowd
of English public school men. The fast pace of their
thinking and speaking represents a higher level of
expression of pretty much the same emotional activity,
and not much more than that.

2. Italian cities are very beautiful and very dirty.
They sure as hell are beautiful, more than you
know. But they are immaculate as burnished marble,
compared with such hygienic grossncsses as Chi
cago, Pittsburgh, New York, Washington. I). C.—
you name them. Stone that is 700 years old can hold
a lot of dust without showing it.
The Italian people are the same.
They are nothing of the kind. When they are poor,
they do not go W; Idorfing. But even the poor look
forward to having saved enough to buy a new suit of
i lothes. Being actors to a man, they delight in beauti
ful clothes and show excellent (not gaudy) taste in
their choice.
You can have a tailor do you a Brooks Bros, creation
for about 35 dollars here. Incidentally, many of the
renowned British woolens are made in Italy. That,
to my mind, proves something worth pondering.
4. Italian is the world's most beautiful language.
It is. possibly excepting Tagalag. just exactly that.
One regards it as a pleasure—yes a privilege—to
speak Italian. And it is surprisingly easy to learn,
partly for that reason.
5. Italy is loaded with Reds.
True, but it is rather a matter of definition. More of
that later.
(To he concluded tomorrow).
