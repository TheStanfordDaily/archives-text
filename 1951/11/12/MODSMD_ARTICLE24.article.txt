# IIR Accomplishes Work Affecting Many Nations
## 
### TOM NEVILLE 
Sandwiched between the Chappie and Quad offices, there's a
big room full of typewriters, travel posters, rows of desks, and
bursting mail boxes. From 3 to 6 Monday through Friday it be
comes a roomful of Stanford students working out the practical
details of an ideal they believe in.
This is the lIR, which means Institute of International Relations.

But it stands for more than just a
room and a name.
"Everyone knows the lIR puts up
posters and talks about the UN,"
President Conrad von Bibra said:
"but there's a lot more to it than
•that. The llR's real work, the work
we think is the most important and
lasting, often goes unpublicized."
Educates Students
A policy planning board including
the officers of the lIR and the heads
of the six lIR committees tries to
work toward understanding be
tween nations, to help those in war
torn areas, and to educate college
students to their international re
sponsibilities.
Here's how they go about it. The
work is divided up among the six
committees, each taking over a spe
cial phase of the job:
UN Education Center: This com
mittee is an official agency of the
UN. Its purpose is to distribute in
formation about the UN to schools
and communities all over North
ern California. It also sponsors UN
Week and publishes a monthly
news-letter.
Travel Committee: This groUp
provides free of charge a year
round travel service to Stanford
students. What to see. where to go.
and how to get there are questions
the Travel Committee can answer.
UNESCO Committee: Like the
UN Education Center, the UNESCO
Committee is an information bu
reau. Its scope is wider since it
sends out speakers on all kinds of
topics, puts on a weekly radio pro
gram. and acts as a general head
quarters for cultural information.
Conference Committee: Whi 1 e
UNESCO gathers the facts, the
Conference Committee gets people
to talk about them. It arranges the
annual High School Conference at
which high school students in
Northern California come together
here at Stanford to learn how in
ternational organizations are run

and what they do. It .sponsored the
Model UN last spring.
SIKO (Stanford International Ke
lief Organization): SIKO does the
llR's most glamorous and also its
dirtiest work. It collects money for
foreign relief, canvasses for clothes
to send to European DP camps, and
gives aid to foreign universities.
Each year SIKO affiliates with
one particular foreign university,
exchanging letters, books, and
clothes. In the past SIKO has
worked with the University of
Naples and the Free University of
Berlin. This year it is waiting for
the ASSU to pass on a proposed
affiljation with the University of
Delhi in India.
International Club:"I" Club is,
according to its president Joe Ayad,
"the sociai counterpart of the 1IR."
Its job is to provide a social meet
| ing ground for students attending
! Stanford from all countries (in
' eluding the United States).
Largest of Its Kind
All in all, the lIK is the biggest
college organization of its kind in
the country. It has received recog
nition from the Saturday Evening
J Post, Milton Eisenhower, Dr. Ralph
! Bunche, and many others.
The lIK operates on an annual
> ASSU allowance of from $2,000 to
! $2,500. Hence all students enrolled
| at Stanford are members of the lIK.

But it stands for more than just a
room and a name.
"Everyone knows the lIR puts up
posters and talks about the UN,"
President Conrad von Bibra said:
"but there's a lot more to it than
•that. The llR's real work, the work
we think is the most important and
lasting, often goes unpublicized."
Educates Students
A policy planning board including
the officers of the lIR and the heads
of the six lIR committees tries to
work toward understanding be
tween nations, to help those in war
torn areas, and to educate college
students to their international re
sponsibilities.
Here's how they go about it. The
work is divided up among the six
committees, each taking over a spe
cial phase of the job:
UN Education Center: This com
mittee is an official agency of the
UN. Its purpose is to distribute in
formation about the UN to schools
and communities all over North
ern California. It also sponsors UN
Week and publishes a monthly
news-letter.
Travel Committee: This groUp
provides free of charge a year
round travel service to Stanford
students. What to see. where to go.
and how to get there are questions
the Travel Committee can answer.
UNESCO Committee: Like the
UN Education Center, the UNESCO
Committee is an information bu
reau. Its scope is wider since it
sends out speakers on all kinds of
topics, puts on a weekly radio pro
gram. and acts as a general head
quarters for cultural information.
Conference Committee: Whi 1 e
UNESCO gathers the facts, the
Conference Committee gets people
to talk about them. It arranges the
annual High School Conference at
which high school students in
Northern California come together
here at Stanford to learn how in
ternational organizations are run

and what they do. It .sponsored the
Model UN last spring.
SIKO (Stanford International Ke
lief Organization): SIKO does the
llR's most glamorous and also its
dirtiest work. It collects money for
foreign relief, canvasses for clothes
to send to European DP camps, and
gives aid to foreign universities.
Each year SIKO affiliates with
one particular foreign university,
exchanging letters, books, and
clothes. In the past SIKO has
worked with the University of
Naples and the Free University of
Berlin. This year it is waiting for
the ASSU to pass on a proposed
affiljation with the University of
Delhi in India.
International Club:"I" Club is,
according to its president Joe Ayad,
"the sociai counterpart of the 1IR."
Its job is to provide a social meet
| ing ground for students attending
! Stanford from all countries (in
' eluding the United States).
Largest of Its Kind
All in all, the lIK is the biggest
college organization of its kind in
the country. It has received recog
nition from the Saturday Evening
J Post, Milton Eisenhower, Dr. Ralph
! Bunche, and many others.
The lIK operates on an annual
> ASSU allowance of from $2,000 to
! $2,500. Hence all students enrolled
| at Stanford are members of the lIK.
Sandwiched between the Chappie and Quad offices, there's a
big room full of typewriters, travel posters, rows of desks, and
bursting mail boxes. From 3 to 6 Monday through Friday it be
comes a roomful of Stanford students working out the practical
details of an ideal they believe in.
This is the lIR, which means Institute of International Relations.

But it stands for more than just a
room and a name.
