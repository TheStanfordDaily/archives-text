SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 11 (UP)
-Coach Chuck Taylor hurried back
to his job on the Stanford campus
today to prepare for the Oregon
State club which he said he "feared
greatly." The Beavers lost to UCLA
yesterday, 7-0; ana the Trojans beat
them by only two points. However,
this will be another single - wing
club, and the Indians already have
beaten four teams using that style
of play.
II the Stanford boys needed any
extra confidence they had it today
in the person of Bob Mathias, the
Olympic decathlon champion, who
came of age as a football player in
the Trojan contest. Scouts labeled
him "one of the great fullbacks of
the country" off his showing in the
game against USC.
His outstanding feat was the 96-
yard touchdown return of a kick
off.
