# Taylor Has Only Praise for Card Team
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Carried off the field on the shoulders of his victorious players.
Coach Chuck Taylor sat limply and happily on a bench in the
Stanford dressing room Saturday, as the press and alums poured
in to pound his back and fire joyous questions at him.
He was as excited, as exhausted, and almost as unable to talk

as the most delirious freshman in
the stands, but all sorts of praise for
his Cards who simply would not be
beaten wanted to pour out at once,
and quite a bit did.
"Morley got us out of a heck of a
hole, and then of course there's
Mathias !
"They seemed to have us on the
ropes when Gary fumbled in the
end zone, but Morley came through
with that long-gaining catch to put
us in scoring position.
"But what the heck! Have you
ever seen a bunch of kids like
those out there today? Mathias,
M c C o 1 1 , Kerkorian, Hugasian,
Horn. Crist, Kirkland, Rye . . .
the whole bunch fought all the
way.
"It was the greatest game I've
ever watched from the bench. I
would have been just as proud of
my kids if they'd tied or been
beaten."
Asked about Mathias' great kick
off return, the red-haired mentor
shrugged sheepishly, "Well, you
name it."
On Kerkoriarrs call that sent
Hugasian slicing on a quick open
er over right tackle to the SC
one to set up the winning TD.

Taylor marveled, "That was an '
excellent call sending Harry again
on the same play that had just
been worked, when with third
down on the 12 the Trojans were
expecting a pass."
Somebody mentioned Hugasian's
broken toe and the novocain needle,
and Taylor said that they had to
rest him intermittently, but that
after the third quarter he did not
feel anything.
Judging from the fact that there
were no casualties on the Indian
side, and that the Trojans' only
injuries were minor, Taylor hit
the nail on the head when he said
it was a very clean but hard hall
game.
Hose Bowl? (And how could that
question be ignored with New
Year's Pasadena celebrations al
ready being planned by most of the
optimistic alums and student root
ers?) "I don't want to talk about the
Rose Bowl," Taylor wisely replied.
"We've got OSC next. But I will
predict a win over the Beavers."
The players, yelling, shouting,
laughing, shaking hands with all
kinds of well wishers, were one of
the most hysterically happy bunches
of guys imaginable.

Horn and Kerkorian just about j
summed it up, as they both raved
about the terrific team spirit.
Kerkorian. with tiie game hall
nestled securely beside him, sat
down exhausted and said, "I've i
waited six months to get this
game ball; those guys out there
just would not quit lighting, even :
after I hobbled the conversion
and then fumbled in the end zone, j
"When the defense held on the
one-loot line, that was a turning
point; it gave the offense a big lift."
On the SC rushing of him, "What
they were doing was fair; if I were
coaching, I'd have my men rush a
passer just that hard.
Horn: "That was the greatest
teamwork and team spirit ever;
even though the Trojans were
stronger, they could not beat us."
Al Kirkland. who transferred
from SC after playing frosh ball
there: "Oh. boy, did we want
that one!"
And so it went on around the
shower room, but, as expected, over
in the Trojan room things were a
bit different. Not bitter, not kick
ing themselves in depression, but
merely a bunch of guys who'd gone
all out and that was not enough,
j Cannamela said, "Yeah, it was a

| very good game."
Coach Jess Hill couldn't under
! stand why his men incurred quite
so many penalties. Of Stanford he
| said: "That's a fine ball team. They
i were resourceful and deserved to
win. The passing attack is the best
we have met this year.
"We were a little flat, especially
in the first half, but in the third
quarter we functioned as well as
we have ever done.
j "That McColl is a terrific end. His
1 tremendous size, faking and
leaping ability keep the pressure on
. the pass defense all the time."
