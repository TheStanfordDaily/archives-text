Win. lose, or draw the next two names. Chuck Taylor is without a doubt
the Coarh «»f the Year for I?>51.
No one has ever more emphatically proved his right to that honor than he
did with Stanford's smashing victory over USC.
The direct credit must go to the players. It was they who got their
teeth knocked out and took the bruises, then picked themselves up by the
spikes of their shoes and went on to win. McColl, Mathias, Kerkorian, Hu
gasian, Essegian, Crist, Vick, Manoogian—you could keep rolling off the
names until you had the whole Indian roster—they were all great. They
were more than great. The team was a team of Ail-Americans.
But it is as a team that they won. No matter how great McColl, Mathias,
or Kerkorian were, their performance was overshadowed by that of the team,
no one could have won the game by himself. And it is to Chuck Taylor that
the credit must go for welding not 11, but 22 men into a team.
On several occasions during that fantastic fourth quarter the ordinary
team would have fallen to pieces, perhaps been rent by dissension. But
instead of folding, Stanford came to life like a reincarnate Hercules, and by
the time the Indians were on their way for their last touchdown the im
pression was that of a lawnmower relentlessly grinding down the blades of
grass. There wasn't a person among the rooters in the stands or listening on
the radio who had the slightest doubt Stanford would win.
But not only has Chuck inspired the team with a confidence and spirit
that has been lacking 'lo these many years, he has developed them to the
peak of their abilities and has made use of their talents where they would
do the most good.
The outstanding example of this is pass defense. Last year Chuck Esseg
ian. Skip Crist, and Dick Horn were all floundering buried in third string
positions while Stanford's secondary looked as if they were playing basket
ball instead of a football game, the result of which was three losses directly
attributable to a non-existent air defense. With the same material, Chuck
Taylor, George Lynn, et al, have fashioned one of the greatest pass defenses
in the nation.
Against an aroused USC team that the week before had successfully
passed against Army in a SNOWSTORM, the Card defenders allowed ex
actly two completions. This merely happened to be one less than the Indian.'

No one has ever more emphatically proved his right to that honor than he
did with Stanford's smashing victory over USC.
The direct credit must go to the players. It was they who got their
teeth knocked out and took the bruises, then picked themselves up by the
spikes of their shoes and went on to win. McColl, Mathias, Kerkorian, Hu
