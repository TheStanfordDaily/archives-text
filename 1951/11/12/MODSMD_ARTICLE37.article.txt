The Village Folk Dancers are the
second biggest of the Co-Recrea
tion organizations at Stanford. It
is the only Village group that hasn't
died from lack of interest or be
cause the person at the head of the
group had to leave. It started out
as a small group and has grown
ever since. There is now an aver
age weekly attendance of about 100.
The question might have entered
your mind as to why anyone would
want to folk dance. A few of the
reasons are that it's different from
the usual run of activities, you can
let your hair down, it's a challenge,
you can participate or watch, it's
| good exercise and relaxation after a
| week of work, and it's an easy way
to meet and mix with people.
The usual program for the eve
ning begins at 7:30 with folk dances
which are for the most part simple
and easy to learn. At 9 there Is a
15 - minute intermission during
which requests are played, an
nouncements are made, and punch
and cookies are served. At .9:15 the
square dance instruction and call
ing starts and lasts to 10, at which
time instruction in advanced dances
is given for the old-timers. At 10:30
the dancing is concluded.
Dances Taught
A dance is completely taught for
two successive weeks. On the third
it is reviewed and from then on the
group is assumed to know it. Be
cause of the mover, many dances
are taught periodically and those
who know the dances arc always
interested in helping the newcom
ers.
The management is now under
the direction of a seven - member
I board, which meets for an hour
each week to hash over the last
week's program, give frank and
honest criticism of the teaching
technique of the members, and dis
cuss the proposed program of
dances and the proposed prblicity
I for the next week.
The members of the board arc
Peggy Dunn, Sally Dunn, Betty
i Erickson, Betty Jacobus, Bud Roe

den, Glenn Walker, and Alan Wil
munder, who work only for person
al enjoyment.
Started in '47
Village folk dancing was started
in 1947 when Bill Barnhart, a stu
dent there, and the Village chaplain
at that time noticed the need for
some type of activity in which both
the single and married Villagers
could participate. Regular Friday
night folk dancing was chosen as
the most logical group activity.
The first groups that attended
were mostly from the Stanford
Hoedowners, but gradually more
people from the Village came and
now it is attended by many men
and women from all over the cam
pus besides the Villagers.
After Bill Barnhart left, the man
agement fell into the hands of his
assistant, Alan Wilmunder, and
Glenn Walker, a newcomer who be
came interested in helping to keep
the group going. They ran it all
last year and now this year it is
under the auspices of the newly
formed Village Folk Dancers' Board.

The Village Folk Dancers are the
second biggest of the Co-Recrea
tion organizations at Stanford. It
is the only Village group that hasn't
died from lack of interest or be
cause the person at the head of the
group had to leave. It started out
as a small group and has grown
ever since. There is now an aver
age weekly attendance of about 100.
The question might have entered
your mind as to why anyone would
want to folk dance. A few of the
reasons are that it's different from
the usual run of activities, you can
let your hair down, it's a challenge,
you can participate or watch, it's
| good exercise and relaxation after a
| week of work, and it's an easy way
to meet and mix with people.
The usual program for the eve
ning begins at 7:30 with folk dances
which are for the most part simple
and easy to learn. At 9 there Is a
15 - minute intermission during
which requests are played, an
nouncements are made, and punch
and cookies are served. At .9:15 the
square dance instruction and call
ing starts and lasts to 10, at which
time instruction in advanced dances
is given for the old-timers. At 10:30
the dancing is concluded.
Dances Taught
A dance is completely taught for
two successive weeks. On the third
it is reviewed and from then on the
group is assumed to know it. Be
cause of the mover, many dances
are taught periodically and those
who know the dances arc always
interested in helping the newcom
ers.
The management is now under
the direction of a seven - member
I board, which meets for an hour
each week to hash over the last
week's program, give frank and
honest criticism of the teaching
technique of the members, and dis
cuss the proposed program of
dances and the proposed prblicity
I for the next week.
The members of the board arc
Peggy Dunn, Sally Dunn, Betty
i Erickson, Betty Jacobus, Bud Roe

den, Glenn Walker, and Alan Wil
munder, who work only for person
al enjoyment.
Started in '47
Village folk dancing was started
in 1947 when Bill Barnhart, a stu
dent there, and the Village chaplain
at that time noticed the need for
some type of activity in which both
the single and married Villagers
could participate. Regular Friday
night folk dancing was chosen as
the most logical group activity.
The first groups that attended
were mostly from the Stanford
Hoedowners, but gradually more
people from the Village came and
now it is attended by many men
and women from all over the cam
pus besides the Villagers.
After Bill Barnhart left, the man
agement fell into the hands of his
assistant, Alan Wilmunder, and
Glenn Walker, a newcomer who be
came interested in helping to keep
the group going. They ran it all
last year and now this year it is
under the auspices of the newly
formed Village Folk Dancers' Board.
