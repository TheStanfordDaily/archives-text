## Denationalization Of Steel Approved 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 12 (UP) â€”Prime
Minister Winston Churchill's Con- j
servative government won its first J
test vote tonight when the House j
of Commons approved his plan to j
turn the British iron and steel in- !
du.stry back to private enterprise.
A Laborite amendment express- j
ing disapproval of the plan was de- |
feated 1320 to 281.
Tonight's vote got the denational
ization plan past its first hurdle. A
hill setting forth the denationaliza
tion scheme is expected to be pre- j
sented within three months.
Supply Minister Duncan Sandys, |
Churchill's son-in-law, presented a j
broadstroke outline of the Conser- j
vative plan, making it clear that j
some public control of the steel in- j
rlustry would continue through a
board representing the government, j
management, labor, and consumers.
