# Vandal Case Clue Sought
## 
### 
The investigation of the paint
smear vandals continued over the
weekend as investigators of the j
Santa Clara County sheriffs office i
checked further on a car seen |
speeding through Menlo Park from
Stanford the night of the paint raid.
The car, traced to a Berkeley cor
poration. is still being searched for
traces of paint, according to local )
police who instigated the investi- j
gation.
Though there is nothing definite
as yet, campus Police Chief Gordon
; Davis said he still believed that
Berkeley youths were involved in
the raid. He reported, however,
that be did not suspect University
of California students but thought
| that a teen-age pack of hoodlums
| was responsible.
Many of the paint splashes have
! been removed from Hoover Tower j
only at a cost of several hundred
dollars, a University spokesman re- j
ported. The spokesman said, how
! ever, that it would be impossible to i
> erase the smears completely.
