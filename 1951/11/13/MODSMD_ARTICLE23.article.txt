# Preferential Voting Used
## 
### 
In tomorrow's election, aa in
every final election, the prefer
ential voting system will bo
used whenever more than two
1 candidates are running for an
office. Perhaps the most notice
able effect this system has is that
it places an additional burden on
the voter; he has to make up his
I mind not once, but three times
for each office.
But the true effect, and the one
I which the system is designed to pro
duce. is that the all-around selection
of the majority of the voters is elect
! p d. This might not be the result if
| each votci were to cast only one vote
in a contest in which four candidates
were entered.
In an election, the voter has only
; to make up his mind, then mark hi,
j first, second, and third choices in th*
boxes clearly marked on the ballot
| From then on, the process is rela
; tively simple.
First choice votes are counted
j and tallied. The ballots are then ar
ranged so that each pile contains the
first choice ballots of one candidate.
If any candidate receives a majority
of the first choices, he is elected with
| no further ado. However, if no can
, didate receives a majority, the one
receiving the lowest number of first
| choices is dropped from the voting
; lust and the votes credited to him are
j eliminated from the tally sheet.
Next, the second choice votes on
| the ballots of the losing candidate are
counted and placed in the piles of
â™¦ hose receiving these second choicer.
I If, when these votes are added to die
j previous count, any candidate has l<
j majority, he is elected.
The process can continue, how
ever, if no candidate yet has a ma
jority. The lowest remaining can-
I didate's first place votes are
j dropped and the second choices on
' his ballots are added to the counts
of the others remaining, etc., until
; someone has a majority.
i The preferential system has proved
very successful in Stanford elections.
The voter should remember that hi:
second and third choices may deter
! mine the final outcome of the elec
' tion, and they should thus be given as
much thought as his first, choice.
