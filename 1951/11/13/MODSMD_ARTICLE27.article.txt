# Magic Word 'Peace' Stolen by Reds
## 
### 
The communists ran off with one of the most
telling thefts of all time at the end of the late
World War. They stole the word "peace."
With hammer-like exploitation of the word, the
communists have persuaded millions of Euro
peans and Asians to think of Russia as the sole
force on earth anxious to see peace. The suc
cess of the Red campaign has hurt the United
States and the United Nations badly.
Indications of late are that the United States
will fight to gain back respectability for the
word "peace." President Truman's recent for
eign policy speeches have been positive. He
has told the world that our country is the real
peace minded nation, and he has challenged
the Russians to back up their loud talk with ac
tion. Other factors, such as increased tempo
for Voice of America broadcasts, suggest that
we are getting back into the "battle for the
word."
A lot of fuss over one word? Yes, but it's
important to see the significance of the great
propaganda victory the Russians have won
by capitalizing upon the word "peace." Trav
elers report the single word "peace" smeared
along alleys and streets throughout the Con
tinent. And always the slogan is identified
with the local communist movement.
The result is inevitable. War-weary people
soon come to identify communism with peace,
ignoring the untold truths of prison camps and
secret police which go hand in hand with to
talitarian methods.
It's like an advertising campaign. Identify
beauty with El Smello soap. Plaster pictures
of beautiful women and El Smello across the

country. Soon, whether reasonable persons
like to admit it or not, El Smello sales leap,
simply because many persons identify
beauty—a good thing—with El Smello soap.
Much the same sort of campaign has been
waged by communists everywhere, using
peace—also a good thing—and communism as
the things which go together.
So the communists have definitely won a
major propaganda victory. But it stands to
reason that if peace can be used to sell com
munism, it can be used to sell democracy and
more specifically the United States.
It should be all the easier for us to sell, be
cause our actions have quite consistently
proved that we are sincere when we say we
want peace.
This country should continue its recent
swing toward exploiting the magic word
"peace" in order to gain back friends. We
should challenge Russia to prove her intentions.
Instead of being defensive, we should be posi
tive and bold in declaring our desire for peace
to the rest of the world.
The U.S. can shout peace and prepare for
defense without being hypocritical. Throw
out the hysterical screams of the far right
press and our record through the past few
years indicates a willingness to cooperate
with the United Nations in promoting a work
able peace program.
There is everything to gain, nothing to lose
in struggling to regain the lost word "peace."
If we win this propaganda victory it might even
do something toward making the word more
than just a word.

do something toward making the word more
than just a word.
The communists ran off with one of the most
telling thefts of all time at the end of the late
World War. They stole the word "peace."
With hammer-like exploitation of the word, the
communists have persuaded millions of Euro
peans and Asians to think of Russia as the sole
force on earth anxious to see peace. The suc
cess of the Red campaign has hurt the United
States and the United Nations badly.
Indications of late are that the United States
will fight to gain back respectability for the
word "peace." President Truman's recent for
eign policy speeches have been positive. He
has told the world that our country is the real
peace minded nation, and he has challenged
the Russians to back up their loud talk with ac
tion. Other factors, such as increased tempo
for Voice of America broadcasts, suggest that
we are getting back into the "battle for the
word."
A lot of fuss over one word? Yes, but it's
important to see the significance of the great
propaganda victory the Russians have won
by capitalizing upon the word "peace." Trav
elers report the single word "peace" smeared
along alleys and streets throughout the Con
tinent. And always the slogan is identified
with the local communist movement.
The result is inevitable. War-weary people
soon come to identify communism with peace,
ignoring the untold truths of prison camps and
secret police which go hand in hand with to
talitarian methods.
It's like an advertising campaign. Identify
beauty with El Smello soap. Plaster pictures
of beautiful women and El Smello across the

country. Soon, whether reasonable persons
like to admit it or not, El Smello sales leap,
simply because many persons identify
beauty—a good thing—with El Smello soap.
Much the same sort of campaign has been
waged by communists everywhere, using
peace—also a good thing—and communism as
the things which go together.
So the communists have definitely won a
major propaganda victory. But it stands to
reason that if peace can be used to sell com
munism, it can be used to sell democracy and
more specifically the United States.
It should be all the easier for us to sell, be
cause our actions have quite consistently
proved that we are sincere when we say we
want peace.
This country should continue its recent
swing toward exploiting the magic word
"peace" in order to gain back friends. We
should challenge Russia to prove her intentions.
Instead of being defensive, we should be posi
tive and bold in declaring our desire for peace
to the rest of the world.
The U.S. can shout peace and prepare for
defense without being hypocritical. Throw
out the hysterical screams of the far right
press and our record through the past few
years indicates a willingness to cooperate
with the United Nations in promoting a work
able peace program.
There is everything to gain, nothing to lose
in struggling to regain the lost word "peace."
If we win this propaganda victory it might even
do something toward making the word more
than just a word.
