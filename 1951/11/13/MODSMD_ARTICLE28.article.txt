# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK McLEAD 
FOR THE LADIES
As the fumes of victory and celebration begin to
clear from the head of the Stanford male, another huge
worry looms on his immediate horizon. It's not Ore
gon State. It's not midterms. It's the Big Game Party.
Now the party itself is not the problem. That won
derful evening takes care of itself. The drive down,
the dinner, the dancing, the singing, the long talks
into the night, the reminiscences of the afternoon's
excitement, the dawn, the tired-happy faces at break
fast: these are easy things that come of their own ac
cord.

But money to pay for all this?
Ah, there's the rub. The Stan
ford Man returned from the
Southland with the garland of
victory gracing his brow. But he
came home barefoot and broke.
He had to sell his little brother
into slavery and run off with the
family savings to even get as far
as San Luis Obispo. His check
book resembles a perfect account
ing problem where everything

balances out to a fine zero. His gas tank reads "empty"
never to see "full" again. The 1.1. R. wiil have to stop
feeding Europe and set up soup kitchens in all the
men's living groups. Things are tight.
"Big Game Party on November 24?" he says. "With
a date? Fourteen to sixteen dollars a couple? Hell
yes, I'm going. May I borrow your hunting rifle?
I'm going down to the Bank of America in Paly." (As
I said, things are really tight.)
But there is an answer.
Hope is not lost. Spinsterhood need not .shadow the
Stanford coed. Our hope, like our glory, lies in tra
dition. This Farm of ours is bound up in a rich back
ing of these customs. And one of the finest, one of the
most democratic, one of the most Stanford of Stanford
traditions is:
THE GIRLS PAY HALF THE FARE ON
BIG GAME NIGHT
The average half fare is about $7.50. This is not
a huge sum: doubled it is monumental. Seven fifty
is the cost of a new accessory to a dress or some
thing equally frivolous. Unless it's a new plunging
neckline, your date won't even notice. So why not

kiss off the now sweater and save the dough. (It
might decide whether you go out Big Game Night or
not.)
Most girls don't know how to insist. When they ask
the poor fellow, "Can I pay half?" he rises to some
momentary height of chivalry mingled with embarass
ment to stammer, "No, it's all right. I think I can
handle it." But just the same his new tuxedo is down
at Moe's with a big "For Sale" sign on it. The Bank
of America has a reward offered for the unknown
robber. And he (the gallant one) faints for hunger
when the waitress is slow in bringing the soup.
, The way to give your destitute date the half fare
is slip it into an envelope and make him take it. Be
firm. Grab his arm and force it up behind his back.
Put your knees in his chin. Twist and pull at the
same time. You'll really be surprised how weak a man
can be, if he is properly motivated.
If the fellow you've been stalking for the last few
weeks hasn't popped the $7.50 question, you can
try a few subtle hints. lA*t me list some of the
smoother ones:
1) "Listen you lug, if I promise to pay half
the fare, will you take me to the Big Game
Party?"
2) ". . . if I promise to pay all of it?"
3) "Well just fancy that! Seven dollars and
fifty cents running around loose in my purse."
4) "I believe in democratic dating, don't
you?"
5) "I believe in free love."
If you want to drop a handkerchief at the male
population in general, here are a few more gentle
hints:
1) Cut out this Bull Session and pin it on
the front of your sweater.
2) Write letters to The Daily.
15) Pledge a fraternity.
With the fine Stanford tradition all understood there
is no reason for any Stanford man or woman to sit
home on Big Game Night. In the immortal words of
Vic Palmieri, "G.D.G.0.G.D." Translated this means
Go Dutch, Girls, Or Get Ditched.

a rabid I ISC alumnus who wants to bet on the Stan
ford - USC football pictures tomorrow night. He

I*.S: One quick money making suggestion. I know
a rabid I ISC alumnus who wants to bet on the Stan
ford - USC football pictures tomorrow night. He
claims Stanford can't do it tw'.ci' in one week.
FOR THE LADIES
As the fumes of victory and celebration begin to
clear from the head of the Stanford male, another huge
worry looms on his immediate horizon. It's not Ore
gon State. It's not midterms. It's the Big Game Party.
Now the party itself is not the problem. That won
derful evening takes care of itself. The drive down,
the dinner, the dancing, the singing, the long talks
into the night, the reminiscences of the afternoon's
excitement, the dawn, the tired-happy faces at break
fast: these are easy things that come of their own ac
cord.

But money to pay for all this?
Ah, there's the rub. The Stan
ford Man returned from the
Southland with the garland of
victory gracing his brow. But he
came home barefoot and broke.
He had to sell his little brother
into slavery and run off with the
family savings to even get as far
as San Luis Obispo. His check
book resembles a perfect account
ing problem where everything

balances out to a fine zero. His gas tank reads "empty"
never to see "full" again. The 1.1. R. wiil have to stop
feeding Europe and set up soup kitchens in all the
men's living groups. Things are tight.
"Big Game Party on November 24?" he says. "With
a date? Fourteen to sixteen dollars a couple? Hell
yes, I'm going. May I borrow your hunting rifle?
I'm going down to the Bank of America in Paly." (As
I said, things are really tight.)
But there is an answer.
Hope is not lost. Spinsterhood need not .shadow the
Stanford coed. Our hope, like our glory, lies in tra
dition. This Farm of ours is bound up in a rich back
ing of these customs. And one of the finest, one of the
most democratic, one of the most Stanford of Stanford
traditions is:
THE GIRLS PAY HALF THE FARE ON
BIG GAME NIGHT
The average half fare is about $7.50. This is not
a huge sum: doubled it is monumental. Seven fifty
is the cost of a new accessory to a dress or some
thing equally frivolous. Unless it's a new plunging
neckline, your date won't even notice. So why not

kiss off the now sweater and save the dough. (It
might decide whether you go out Big Game Night or
not.)
Most girls don't know how to insist. When they ask
the poor fellow, "Can I pay half?" he rises to some
momentary height of chivalry mingled with embarass
ment to stammer, "No, it's all right. I think I can
handle it." But just the same his new tuxedo is down
at Moe's with a big "For Sale" sign on it. The Bank
of America has a reward offered for the unknown
robber. And he (the gallant one) faints for hunger
when the waitress is slow in bringing the soup.
, The way to give your destitute date the half fare
is slip it into an envelope and make him take it. Be
firm. Grab his arm and force it up behind his back.
Put your knees in his chin. Twist and pull at the
same time. You'll really be surprised how weak a man
can be, if he is properly motivated.
If the fellow you've been stalking for the last few
weeks hasn't popped the $7.50 question, you can
try a few subtle hints. lA*t me list some of the
smoother ones:
1) "Listen you lug, if I promise to pay half
the fare, will you take me to the Big Game
Party?"
2) ". . . if I promise to pay all of it?"
3) "Well just fancy that! Seven dollars and
fifty cents running around loose in my purse."
4) "I believe in democratic dating, don't
you?"
5) "I believe in free love."
If you want to drop a handkerchief at the male
population in general, here are a few more gentle
hints:
1) Cut out this Bull Session and pin it on
the front of your sweater.
2) Write letters to The Daily.
15) Pledge a fraternity.
With the fine Stanford tradition all understood there
is no reason for any Stanford man or woman to sit
home on Big Game Night. In the immortal words of
Vic Palmieri, "G.D.G.0.G.D." Translated this means
Go Dutch, Girls, Or Get Ditched.

FOR THE LADIES
As the fumes of victory and celebration begin to
clear from the head of the Stanford male, another huge
worry looms on his immediate horizon. It's not Ore
gon State. It's not midterms. It's the Big Game Party.
Now the party itself is not the problem. That won
derful evening takes care of itself. The drive down,
the dinner, the dancing, the singing, the long talks
into the night, the reminiscences of the afternoon's
excitement, the dawn, the tired-happy faces at break
fast: these are easy things that come of their own ac
cord.

But money to pay for all this?
Ah, there's the rub. The Stan
ford Man returned from the
Southland with the garland of
victory gracing his brow. But he
came home barefoot and broke.
He had to sell his little brother
into slavery and run off with the
family savings to even get as far
as San Luis Obispo. His check
book resembles a perfect account
ing problem where everything

balances out to a fine zero. His gas tank reads "empty"
never to see "full" again. The 1.1. R. wiil have to stop
feeding Europe and set up soup kitchens in all the
men's living groups. Things are tight.
"Big Game Party on November 24?" he says. "With
a date? Fourteen to sixteen dollars a couple? Hell
yes, I'm going. May I borrow your hunting rifle?
I'm going down to the Bank of America in Paly." (As
I said, things are really tight.)
But there is an answer.
Hope is not lost. Spinsterhood need not .shadow the
Stanford coed. Our hope, like our glory, lies in tra
dition. This Farm of ours is bound up in a rich back
ing of these customs. And one of the finest, one of the
most democratic, one of the most Stanford of Stanford
traditions is:
THE GIRLS PAY HALF THE FARE ON
BIG GAME NIGHT
The average half fare is about $7.50. This is not
a huge sum: doubled it is monumental. Seven fifty
is the cost of a new accessory to a dress or some
thing equally frivolous. Unless it's a new plunging
neckline, your date won't even notice. So why not

kiss off the now sweater and save the dough. (It
might decide whether you go out Big Game Night or
not.)
Most girls don't know how to insist. When they ask
the poor fellow, "Can I pay half?" he rises to some
momentary height of chivalry mingled with embarass
ment to stammer, "No, it's all right. I think I can
handle it." But just the same his new tuxedo is down
at Moe's with a big "For Sale" sign on it. The Bank
of America has a reward offered for the unknown
robber. And he (the gallant one) faints for hunger
when the waitress is slow in bringing the soup.
, The way to give your destitute date the half fare
is slip it into an envelope and make him take it. Be
firm. Grab his arm and force it up behind his back.
Put your knees in his chin. Twist and pull at the
same time. You'll really be surprised how weak a man
can be, if he is properly motivated.
If the fellow you've been stalking for the last few
weeks hasn't popped the $7.50 question, you can
try a few subtle hints. lA*t me list some of the
smoother ones:
1) "Listen you lug, if I promise to pay half
the fare, will you take me to the Big Game
Party?"
2) ". . . if I promise to pay all of it?"
3) "Well just fancy that! Seven dollars and
fifty cents running around loose in my purse."
4) "I believe in democratic dating, don't
you?"
5) "I believe in free love."
If you want to drop a handkerchief at the male
population in general, here are a few more gentle
hints:
1) Cut out this Bull Session and pin it on
the front of your sweater.
2) Write letters to The Daily.
15) Pledge a fraternity.
