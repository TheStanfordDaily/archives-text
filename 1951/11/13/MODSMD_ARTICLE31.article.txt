# Stanford Spirit Is Cited As Example for Huskies
## 
### WALT MENNINGER 
The renowned Stanford Spirit
was held high as an example to
students at the University of
Washington last week as the
University of Washington Daily
shot some editorial broadsides
at the Seattle student body's
non-existent spirit.
Criticizing the fading of Wash
ington spirit with the fading of the
Rose Bowl hopes, Sports Editor
Fred Delkin cut loose with the
sharpest blast when he wrote:
"Student spirit on this campus
is disgustingly poor! . . . Team
spirit was terrible in the Home
coming game, but it was no worse
thau the unenthusiastic display
put on by the student cheering
section."
Editor-in-chief Dave Wood of the
Washington Daily typified the sit
uation in another way in an edito
rial when he quoted a student as
saying, "I feel the same way toward
the Washington football team as I
do toward the Seattle Rainiers. If
the team wins, that's fine. If it
loses, I don't particularly care."
Delkin, looking for a rationaliza
tion for the non - existent spirit,
finds the student body at fault.
He points out that "only a se
lect few of the colleges in the
country have bowl-bound teams.
Hundreds of campuses in the
country are in the throes of a
losing grid season, yet their sta
dium seats are filled, and the
student bodies back their teams
to the hilt. . . .
''At Stanford, the students never
let up in their support of the team,
even when the coaching is poor and
the team is losing, as it was the last
few seasons under Marchie
Schwartz."
What's the exact cause for the
lack of spirit ivi Seattle? Sports
wviter Delkin points his accusing
pen at the fact that Washington
fans have no traditional rivals to
point for, and their support sim
ply fades with a losing team.
In fact, the sports editor declares,
members of the Washington coach
ing staff have expressed their
"amazement" that the student sup
port is weak even when the ball
club is winning.
Delkin concludes that the "short
comings of our football organiza
tion will be remedied a lot faster if
the Washington students show they
care about the actions of their grid
machine."
Editor-in-chief Wood shifts his
sights a little higher and blasts
his tirade not at the students but

at the administration. Criticizing
the higher-ups for impersonal and
almost antagonistic actions, the
editor thinks the corrections
should be made there.
Listing as examples the parking
problem, the library closure, and
the turning away of two students
and their three-year-old son from
the football game, the editorial
takes issue with the administration
for not making "exceptions."
Writes Wood, "Partial solutions
to pressing problems have restored
some faith, . . . but the net result
is a little less devotion to the Uni
versity. . . . The fact that it (the
University) is so impersonal is the
very thing which makes real spirit
impossible."
