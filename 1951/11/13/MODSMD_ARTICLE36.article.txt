## Punts and Pitches Rose Bowl Tidbits 
### 
Several weeks av ,we printed a statement made by tackle Tsar Calfee,
when he was declared out lor the season because of a broken ankle bone.
People laughed at that statement at the time, but we think it is worth a
revival. As you may remember, Calfee said, "Don't worry, I'll be back for
the Rose Eowl."
Also back for the Rose Bowl will be linebacker Gordy Rice, who will
recover before Calfee. Eric South wood should be ready for Oregon State
this week.
We don't want to he one of those "I told you so" people, hut we said at
the beginning of the season that Stanford would very likely go to Pasadena
on New Years, and we have repeated it often. Many students correctly
believe that the S.'ose Bowl isn't Stanford's yet, and incorrectly think that the
Cards are ovt■••-confident and will be easy upset prey for Oregon State and
Cal.
On the contrary, our come-through gang isn't over-confident. They
realize the .strength of the Beavers and California. Chuck Taylor and the
staff won't let them be unaware of it. The Indians have all the more in
centive to v. in now, because (1) they want to go to the Rose Bowl, (2) they
want to have an undefeated season, and (3) they want to win for the coach
ing stall's sake. Nc thing would tickle them more than to see Taylor get
the "coach of the year" award.
Pack my coon-skin coat, my like, and my Stanford pennant. Maw. I'm off
to the Rose Bowl.

A BIG SIX AND A LOCOMOTIVE FOR RALLY COM. One of the
greatest sports at Stanford is to take a poke at Rally Com. It's the thing to
do, and no one is a part of the "gang" unless he says something disparaging
about the kids who wear white saddle shoes. Rally Com has made some
mistakes this year, just as every campus organization does, but their USC
game effort tops anything they've done since we've been at Stanford.
Besides working out the card stunts, which included giving the half
time score, Bill Otterson and his gang scheduled a pep rally last Wednesday,
had a group (and the Stanford banner) to welcome the team at the Bur
bank Airport, threw a rally Friday night, and scheduled a "welcome-home"
turnout for the team on Sunday. Incidentally, it was the first time a rally
has ever been held by Stanford in the Southland.
Some of the kids on Rally Com are just out for the glory of it, but most
of Otter!'oil's 80 underlings put a lot of hard work into keeping the Stanford
Spirit at a fever pitch. And it's about time someone realized it.

lIUZZAHS FOR MCCOLL. Bill McColl, who plays a little football for
Stanford each Saturday, walked into his 9 a.m. anatomy lab a little late
yesterday. As he entered, the class gave him a rousing cheer. Bill, sporting
a tomato-red blush, sat down and the class proceeded.
* * *
MISCELLANY DEPT. Definitely in poor taste was the chant, "Back to
the zoo, forty-two," yelled by some of the rooters. A guy can't help how
lie look i. God made him that way. We interviewed Cannamela after the
game, and i tually he was a nice guy. He didn't walk on all fours, swing
from the tree tops, and eat bananas. Bill McColl and Chuck Taylor also
thought that the chant was in poor taste and requested that the rooting
section cease fire.
Radio commentator Dink Templeton was at the Cal game Saturday when
he heard the score of the Stanford game being announced. Washington and
Cal were fi. hting it out at 28 to 27 at the time, but Dink forgot about that
game and ran to hi.- car radio in order to hear the end of the Coliseum tiff.
That night on his program, Dink raved all 15 minutes about the StanfoTd
game, and even forgot to mention the Cal score.
Speaking of the Cal gome, the Bear rooters did the unheard of by chant
ing, "Stanford's going to the Rose Bowl." The Berkeley hand also struck
up with "Come Join the Band," when the score from Los Angeles was
announced.
In the meantime, holy bedlam broke out in the Stanford rooting section,
especially when Mathias went all the way. Boys were hugging and kissing
girls they didn't even know. A boy who was on campus told us that even
the sedate grad students who don't know the difference between a football
and a volleyball and who usually study in the libe during Big Game were
racing around campus, honking horns and rolling on lawns in gestures ol
sheer glee.
We're still so excited we've got to stop: otherwise we may go limp. It
was the greatest game ever. See ya at the Rose Bowl.

In the meantime, holy bedlam broke out in the Stanford rooting section,
especially when Mathias went all the way. Boys were hugging and kissing
girls they didn't even know. A boy who was on campus told us that even
the sedate grad students who don't know the difference between a football
and a volleyball and who usually study in the libe during Big Game were
racing around campus, honking horns and rolling on lawns in gestures ol
sheer glee.
We're still so excited we've got to stop: otherwise we may go limp. It
was the greatest game ever. See ya at the Rose Bowl.
Several weeks av ,we printed a statement made by tackle Tsar Calfee,
when he was declared out lor the season because of a broken ankle bone.
People laughed at that statement at the time, but we think it is worth a
revival. As you may remember, Calfee said, "Don't worry, I'll be back for
the Rose Eowl."
Also back for the Rose Bowl will be linebacker Gordy Rice, who will
recover before Calfee. Eric South wood should be ready for Oregon State
this week.
We don't want to he one of those "I told you so" people, hut we said at
the beginning of the season that Stanford would very likely go to Pasadena
on New Years, and we have repeated it often. Many students correctly
believe that the S.'ose Bowl isn't Stanford's yet, and incorrectly think that the
Cards are ovt■••-confident and will be easy upset prey for Oregon State and
Cal.
On the contrary, our come-through gang isn't over-confident. They
realize the .strength of the Beavers and California. Chuck Taylor and the
staff won't let them be unaware of it. The Indians have all the more in
centive to v. in now, because (1) they want to go to the Rose Bowl, (2) they
want to have an undefeated season, and (3) they want to win for the coach
ing stall's sake. Nc thing would tickle them more than to see Taylor get
the "coach of the year" award.
Pack my coon-skin coat, my like, and my Stanford pennant. Maw. I'm off
to the Rose Bowl.

A BIG SIX AND A LOCOMOTIVE FOR RALLY COM. One of the
greatest sports at Stanford is to take a poke at Rally Com. It's the thing to
do, and no one is a part of the "gang" unless he says something disparaging
about the kids who wear white saddle shoes. Rally Com has made some
mistakes this year, just as every campus organization does, but their USC
game effort tops anything they've done since we've been at Stanford.
Besides working out the card stunts, which included giving the half
time score, Bill Otterson and his gang scheduled a pep rally last Wednesday,
had a group (and the Stanford banner) to welcome the team at the Bur
bank Airport, threw a rally Friday night, and scheduled a "welcome-home"
turnout for the team on Sunday. Incidentally, it was the first time a rally
has ever been held by Stanford in the Southland.
Some of the kids on Rally Com are just out for the glory of it, but most
of Otter!'oil's 80 underlings put a lot of hard work into keeping the Stanford
Spirit at a fever pitch. And it's about time someone realized it.

lIUZZAHS FOR MCCOLL. Bill McColl, who plays a little football for
Stanford each Saturday, walked into his 9 a.m. anatomy lab a little late
yesterday. As he entered, the class gave him a rousing cheer. Bill, sporting
a tomato-red blush, sat down and the class proceeded.

MISCELLANY DEPT. Definitely in poor taste was the chant, "Back to
the zoo, forty-two," yelled by some of the rooters. A guy can't help how
lie look i. God made him that way. We interviewed Cannamela after the
game, and i tually he was a nice guy. He didn't walk on all fours, swing
from the tree tops, and eat bananas. Bill McColl and Chuck Taylor also
thought that the chant was in poor taste and requested that the rooting
section cease fire.
Radio commentator Dink Templeton was at the Cal game Saturday when
he heard the score of the Stanford game being announced. Washington and
Cal were fi. hting it out at 28 to 27 at the time, but Dink forgot about that
game and ran to hi.- car radio in order to hear the end of the Coliseum tiff.
That night on his program, Dink raved all 15 minutes about the StanfoTd
game, and even forgot to mention the Cal score.
Speaking of the Cal gome, the Bear rooters did the unheard of by chant
ing, "Stanford's going to the Rose Bowl." The Berkeley hand also struck
up with "Come Join the Band," when the score from Los Angeles was
announced.

Cal were fi. hting it out at 28 to 27 at the time, but Dink forgot about that
game and ran to hi.- car radio in order to hear the end of the Coliseum tiff.
That night on his program, Dink raved all 15 minutes about the StanfoTd
game, and even forgot to mention the Cal score.
Speaking of the Cal gome, the Bear rooters did the unheard of by chant
ing, "Stanford's going to the Rose Bowl." The Berkeley hand also struck
up with "Come Join the Band," when the score from Los Angeles was
announced.
In the meantime, holy bedlam broke out in the Stanford rooting section,
especially when Mathias went all the way. Boys were hugging and kissing
girls they didn't even know. A boy who was on campus told us that even
the sedate grad students who don't know the difference between a football
and a volleyball and who usually study in the libe during Big Game were
racing around campus, honking horns and rolling on lawns in gestures ol
sheer glee.
We're still so excited we've got to stop: otherwise we may go limp. It
was the greatest game ever. See ya at the Rose Bowl.
Several weeks av ,we printed a statement made by tackle Tsar Calfee,
when he was declared out lor the season because of a broken ankle bone.
People laughed at that statement at the time, but we think it is worth a
revival. As you may remember, Calfee said, "Don't worry, I'll be back for
the Rose Eowl."
Also back for the Rose Bowl will be linebacker Gordy Rice, who will
recover before Calfee. Eric South wood should be ready for Oregon State
this week.
We don't want to he one of those "I told you so" people, hut we said at
the beginning of the season that Stanford would very likely go to Pasadena
on New Years, and we have repeated it often. Many students correctly
believe that the S.'ose Bowl isn't Stanford's yet, and incorrectly think that the
Cards are ovt■••-confident and will be easy upset prey for Oregon State and
Cal.
On the contrary, our come-through gang isn't over-confident. They
realize the .strength of the Beavers and California. Chuck Taylor and the
staff won't let them be unaware of it. The Indians have all the more in
centive to v. in now, because (1) they want to go to the Rose Bowl, (2) they
want to have an undefeated season, and (3) they want to win for the coach
ing stall's sake. Nc thing would tickle them more than to see Taylor get
the "coach of the year" award.
Pack my coon-skin coat, my like, and my Stanford pennant. Maw. I'm off
to the Rose Bowl.

A BIG SIX AND A LOCOMOTIVE FOR RALLY COM. One of the
greatest sports at Stanford is to take a poke at Rally Com. It's the thing to
do, and no one is a part of the "gang" unless he says something disparaging
about the kids who wear white saddle shoes. Rally Com has made some
mistakes this year, just as every campus organization does, but their USC
game effort tops anything they've done since we've been at Stanford.
Besides working out the card stunts, which included giving the half
time score, Bill Otterson and his gang scheduled a pep rally last Wednesday,
had a group (and the Stanford banner) to welcome the team at the Bur
bank Airport, threw a rally Friday night, and scheduled a "welcome-home"
turnout for the team on Sunday. Incidentally, it was the first time a rally
has ever been held by Stanford in the Southland.
Some of the kids on Rally Com are just out for the glory of it, but most
of Otter!'oil's 80 underlings put a lot of hard work into keeping the Stanford
Spirit at a fever pitch. And it's about time someone realized it.

lIUZZAHS FOR MCCOLL. Bill McColl, who plays a little football for
Stanford each Saturday, walked into his 9 a.m. anatomy lab a little late
yesterday. As he entered, the class gave him a rousing cheer. Bill, sporting
a tomato-red blush, sat down and the class proceeded.

MISCELLANY DEPT. Definitely in poor taste was the chant, "Back to
the zoo, forty-two," yelled by some of the rooters. A guy can't help how
lie look i. God made him that way. We interviewed Cannamela after the
game, and i tually he was a nice guy. He didn't walk on all fours, swing
from the tree tops, and eat bananas. Bill McColl and Chuck Taylor also
thought that the chant was in poor taste and requested that the rooting
section cease fire.
