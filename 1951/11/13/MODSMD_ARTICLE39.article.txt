# Team Preps For OSC Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity footballers took
a day oft' from physical workouts
yesterday afternoon, but will re- j
turn to heavy action this afternoon. J
Practice yesterday was confined !
to a .skull session for digesting the j
scout report on OSC and review- 1
ing the Trojan game movies.
Heavy concentration was given to .
the latter activities, however, since ;
Coach Chuck Taylor reported that 1
"we face a real tough game this j
Saturday against Oregon State."
The injury situation appeared
bright for the Cards' remaining two j
games as trainer Connie Jarvis re- |
ported that we came out of the SC
game "without even a major |
bruise."
Co-captain Jesse Cone will likely i
be confined to limited action on his j
knee again this weekend against the
Beavers, but should be ready to go
full steam against Cal in the Big
Game.
Center Rod Garner had a knee
brace fitted yesterday for his ailing
limb, but he was favoring it only j
slightly and with the brace should
be in the best of shape for Saturday. 1
