## Taylor Picks Cards Again; Fehring to Scout Illinois 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 12 (UP)—Coach Chuck Taylor of Stan
ford predicted today that the Indians would win their ninth straight
game against Oregon State Saturday and at the same time finally
confessed interest in the Rose Bowl when he announced that he
would send his top assistant, Dutch Fehring, to scout Illinois this
week.
The usually modest mentor, who appears brash only when he

makes forecasts, made this state- j
ment:
''We will beat Oregon State if we
play our best game of the season." i
He finally had to listen to Rose
Bowl talk, he said, and as a result
will dispatch Dutch Fehring, con- j
sidered by many to be the best |
scout in the West, to take a look
at Illinois.
In retrospect the young coach said j
that the Southern California Tro- j
jans were "so good" that he still j
doesn't know how Stanford won |
that 27-20 thriller Saturday, ex- :
cept that "maybe we are living
right."
"That tailback, Frank Gifford, is !
as great as advertised. He made our 1

tacklers look bad," said Taylor.
"And they had great kicking. If
they had called A 1 Carmichael more
on those reverses they would have
been scoring yet.
' After the game I thought we had
played a good game. But after look
ing at the movies I find we didn't
play as good as I thought. Emo
tionally we were great; technically,
not so good."
"McColJ's pass - catching, of
course, was great; and his blocking
was very outstanding, too," he said.
"1 also would like to point out that
halfback Harry liugasian played
his best game of the year—despite
the fact he had a broken toe.
