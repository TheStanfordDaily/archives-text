# SC Jayvees Rip Braves
## 
### 
All was not milk and honey in
the Southland last Saturday. USC's
Spartans lived up to their press no
tices and trounced the invading
Stanford Braves 24 to 0 in the var
sity preliminary.
The Spartan JV's scored on the
final play of the first half when
Sam Tsagalakis booted a 32-yard
field goal to break up a defensive
ball game and open the scoring flood
j gates.
Following the intermission, SC-er
Dick Petty blocked a Brave punt
and recovered on Stanford's 13. And
it was quarterback Ed Demirjian
I who sneaked over after three plays.
An intercepted Stanford pass set
up the third Spartan score. Sol
Naumu carried over for the six
pointer. It was a Demirjian pass to
1 A 1 Kirkland that gave SC their
! final tally.
Stanford could do nothing in the
j way of getting a march going.
