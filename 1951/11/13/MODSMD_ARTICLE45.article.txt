Although Stanford's football |
team has grabbed most of the
headlines this fall, Stanford's
best - ever water polo team ha*
also had a pivfeit season with
nine wins in a row. II and when
they defeat an inept Cal team on
Big ( iame morning, it will mark
the first time a Card water polo
team has ever been undefeated
in PCC play.
The water polo team, again like !
the football team, is led by a two
time All - American, Bob Frojen. |
Frojen gained his All - American j
recognition while playing for the
national champion Whittier A.C. j
club. He played guard and center
back for Whittier and now plays
center-forward for Stanford.
Coach Tom Haynie considers Fro
jen "the finest player in the PCC, '
that he ever coached, and in the i
history of Stanford."
Frojen is a Delt. He comes from
Fullerton, and although he gradu
ates this year from Stanford, he j
plans to continue playing for Whit- !
tier for a while. He will probably j
be on the 1952 Olympic team.
Against Fullerton JC, Frojen
dumped in four last-quarter goals
to give Stanford a dramatic G to 3
win. He put in two goals in the
first two minutes in Stanford's hec
tic 7 to 6 win over UCLA. He has
dunked in 26 goals in nine wins.


WATER WIZARD Bob Frojen, ace Indian water poloist, sets up
another goal.
