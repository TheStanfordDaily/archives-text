# SIRO Will Help Clothe D.P.'s Again
## 
### 
Thanks to Stanford's Internation- 1
al Relief Organization, a lot of DP's
behind the Iron Curtain have shoes
on their feet, sweaters on their
backs, and a new outlook in an
otherwise bleak world.
Last year SIRO collected, packed,
and sent abroad all the clothing it
could find after soliciting dorms and
homes on campus and in Palo Alto.
'The strength of common feeling
and understanding that arises from
such gifts cannot be overestimated,"
writes one grateful Austrian DP.
SIRO plans to continue its pro
gram again this year. This after
noon at 4:15 in the lIR Shack, plan
ning chairmen Louise Sinden and
Dave Workman will hold a meeting
for all those interested in any phase
of the work. SIRO depends en
tirely on student workers.
Packing will start as soon as pcr
sonnel can be organized. A room
ful of clothing collected in the Vil
lage last year must be packed im
mediately before more can be done.
Village packing chairman Bobbie
Bcnion has issued a call for stu
dents living in the Village to help
as much as possible.
Last year Frosh Excom sponsored
a scavenger hunt for SIRO to col
lect clothes in Palo Alto homes and
churches. Once organized, the job
took only one evening.
After the clothing has been col
lected and packed, the World Uni
versity Service sends the packages
to DP camps in Austria. Then they
are distributed to needy refugees.
Many of these people are in poor
health and possess little or nothing.
These DP's arc not wanted by the
Austrian government, and they
cannot emigrate or return to their
homes.
