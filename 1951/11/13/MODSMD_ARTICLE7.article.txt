# Stanford Professor On Wrecked Train
## 
### CLIFFORD F. WEIGLE Professor of Journalism, Stanford University, as told to the United Press 
EVANSTON, Wyo., Nov. 12 (UP)—That's as close as I ever
want to come to death.
I was sitting in the washroom of the front coach of the City of
San Francisco when it plowed into the rear of the City of Los
Angeles passenger train five miles west of here today.

It was a scene I never want to j
sec again.
Without any warning the train j
stopped with a terrific jolt and I
threw furniture across the wash- j
room and banged it against the for- j
ward wall. I walked back in the I
coach and saw passengers and lug- j
gage thrown all over the floor of I
the car. The car was off the tracks. |
Practically everybody in our i
car got a bump of some kind. I
got a sore rib.
I looked out of our coach and j
forward to where our locomotive
hit tbe observation car of the
City of I.os Angeles.
It was a complete shambles. Our
locomotive was literally buried un
der the wreckage of the Los An- :
geles observation car.
It was snowing all the time and ;
there was about, a foot of snow on j
the ground. We were about 300 i

Reports of the number of casual- !
ties—when the City of San Fran
cisco telescoped the rear four cars
of the City of Los Angeles—mount
ed today.
The Union Pacific passenger agent
from Salt Lake City, Arthur G.
Bloom, fixed the death toll at 20
at 11:15 p.m.

i yards from the highway then, and
! after the first hour at the scene only
one stretcher had been taken out.
We were told they needed cutting
equipment to get into the wreckage
|of the locomotive and observation
| car. All up and down the line, cars
i were derailed.
It's hist unbelievable (he way
those cars were torn to pieros.
I don't sre how anyone got out
of that observation car alive. A
woman told me sh? saw a r'ortor
! she had met earlier on the Los
Angeles who was decapitated.
I was headed for Detroit and the
j national convention of the Sigma
| Delta Chi fraternity when the
I wreck happened. The Union Pa
| cific is supposed to get us out of
| here yet tonight.
