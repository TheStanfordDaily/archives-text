# Western Union Plans Campus 'Telefax' Poll
## 
### 
More than 5,000 students are re
ceiving questionnaires from West
ern Union this week in a survey of
the campus to determine the u-o
and desirability of the "Telefax"
facsimile machines.
Two of the machines are now lo
cated on campus in connection with
a Western Union "great experi
ment." Placed in the Cellar and in
the Fncina lobby last year, the ma
chines trail'mit messages directly to
the Palo Alto tclceraph office.
The campus survey, explained C.
B. Melter, Western Union district
sales manager, is part of further
company research on the facsimile
machines.
Said Melter, "Western Union
wants to know what it can do to
further ' facilitate students' tele
graphing. Wc hope that students
will answer the questions conscien
tiously. as we arc depending on the
answers to determine our future
policy."
