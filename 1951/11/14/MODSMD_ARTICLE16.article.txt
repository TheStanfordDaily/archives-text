## 'Great Drive In Germany' 
### 
"There is a tremendous drive
in Germany today, an almost fe- j
verish activity that finds its way |
into statistics on production, ex- j
ports, employment, and be-!
comes visible in the form of re
building in cities and towns,"
was the opinion of Dr. Helmut j
R. Boeninger, assistant professor
of Germanic languages, in last
night's Tuesday Evening Series
lecture.
Dr. Born emphasized the
tremendous erowth of German cit
ies and towns since the war ended.
He also found the cities teeming
with people busy with the task of
rebuilding their homes and busi
nesses.
They are making slow beginnings
to take care of the most urgent
needs, with public housing projects
going up in the more badly shat
tered areas. The first housing law
of the West Gorman Republic is ]
trying to stimulate this kind of
building.
Rebuilding
There arc examples of rebuilding
in exact replica of old buildings, of
adaptation of old ideas to modern
needs, and of outspokenly new and
modern construction.
But besides the visible wreckage,
there is human wreckage, economic
shambles, broken limbs, and bro
ken homes. There are shattered
roofs, shattered personalities, and
shattered illusions.
Colored Slides
Dr. Boeninger showed with col
ored slides of various German cities
and towns the effort the German
people are making to create some
thing worth while for the future
out of the remnants of their past.
He also described the aid the Eu
ropean Recovery Program is giving
to the country in rebuilding their
buildings and roads. He described
the resorts constructed in Austria
to start up the tourist trade aagin.
