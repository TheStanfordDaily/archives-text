# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
WEDNESDAY M-OWNING ROUNDUP
J in still so excited about the SC game that every
Jew minut<\s I'm going to have to lie down and jest.
You may do whatever you wish while I am resting.

CADAVER SEQUEL. Several
weeks ago we wrote that a med
school cadaver had mysteriously
changed position overnight. Now
comes the report from first-year
med student Dave Sachs that he
left his cadaver face up, came back
the next morning and found it face
down. Sachs was last seen chang
ing his major to psych.
Speaking of cadavers, six foot
four inch Bill McColl complains

that his cadaver is only lour feet nine.
CLEVER RETORT DEPT. A Stanford coed recently
went to one of the librarians in the main 1 ihe and
asked for a certain book of Plato's writings. The li
brarian led the coed through files and the inner sanc
toms of the libe. and 20 minutes later came up with
the book.
The student expressed her thanks and went to her
seat to start wading through Plato. She opened the
j book and found it was written in German. The coed
i returned the book to the librarian and allowed that
! Plato was difficult enough in English, much less.
1 German. She made it plain that she wanted it in
the English language.
The flustered librarian apologized, retreated into
the dank depths of the libe, and twenty minutes later
emerged with the Plato book. The girl returned to her
seat, opened the book, looked at it, closed it, and went
back to the librarian. "This book," the girl announced,
"is Greek to me," with which she returned the book
written in Greek.
The librarian was really out of it.
ARMED ROBBERY. When the recent Time article
described our generation as less likely to do the un

usual, the flamboyant, they forgot to consult Ron Wil
son. Wilson a junior, was in the BAC and noticed that
an armored car was backed up to the front door. An
attendant was busy moving thousands of dollars of
money. Wilson decided that he hadn't had his kicks
for the day so he crept up behind the attendant, stuck
his finger in his back, and stick 'em
up!"
The attendant threw his arms in the air, and Wil
son. satisfied that he had accomplished his purpose,
left. At last report, the white-laced attendant was
still standing with his hands in (lie air.
SC GAME POST-MORTEMS. I was in Gary Ker
korian's room in the Huntington Hotel the morning
of the SC game. Bill McColl was there too, and he
said, "Well, you've got to throw today, Gary." Gary
agreed, "Yes, I've got to throw today." And he did.
A boy and a girl were listening to the encounter
over the radio at Elm, until things looked black and
the girl ran into the next room to weep and listen by
herself. When Stanford made it 20 to 20, the boy got
so excited that he knocked on the glass door and put
his hand right through it.

A writer named Tom Bottaro for the Southern Cal
Daily Trojan wrote the following gem last Friday,
and I think it is worth reprinting:
"The Indians do not play the same type of ball game
the Trojans do. Stanford, like most other T-formation
teams, doesn't concentrate on the crunching type of
roll-over-'em football that SC and other single-wing
elevens use.
"Spirit or no spirit, the Indians have 22 football
players, and after that they get pretty thin. It's
likely they'll fade in the fourth quarter under the
pounding they'll get from the Trojans, who know
what the stakes are and who also will he hepped up.
"The spirit factor cancels out and all that's remain
ing is playing ability. SC takes the edge there."
Thank you for your analysis, Mr. Bottaro.
