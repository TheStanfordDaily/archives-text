## For Keeping Language Requirements 
### 
To the Editor:
' been following the language requirement
controversy in The Daily, and would like to join the
fray oh behalf of foreign languages. The opponents of
this requirement maintain that studying foreign lan
guages is a waste of time. We disagree, for the follow
ing reasons:
First, knowledge of a foreign language is part of a
liberal education, which is the ostensible purpose for
coming to such a school as Stanford. Such knowledge
might even be useful in husband-hunting, or being
a successful stock-broker. Stranger things have hap
pened. The studying of a language other than your
own is also valuable for the grounding in grammar and
vocabulary it gives, which is transferable to English
usage.
Se»cond, and we consider this most important, the
day of isolationism is over, whether we like it or not.
America is now the leader of most of the Western
World. And we are not a popular top dog. Most
Europeans consider us to he badly spoiled and worse
educated. They deeply resent our power. And any
superior airs on our part only make them more re
sentful. A working knowledge of a European lan
guage Is a courtesy which can oil diplomatic wheels.
Also, a certain feeling for other civilizations comes
with the study of other languages. Most Europeans
learn English in their schools. But they resent our
bland assumption that English is the only language:
forcing our language upon them because we cannot
speak theirs only deepens their resentment of us, and
makes us appeal- more arrogant than ever.
One of the best ways to cure this is to increase the
numbers who can French, or Italian, or Ger
man. Not only diplomats, but the average tourist, can
improve international relations by knowing the lan
guage and customs of the countries he visits. This,
incidentally, applies to English as well; as Winston
Churchill once said "Two great countries separated
by a common language." Such adaptability in no way
hurts us, and does go a long way toward soothing the
pride of nations who dislike us as leaders.
By their standards we are not fit for this leader
ship. but we are the only nation now in a position
to provide it. It Is up to us to be good leaders, but
even more .to make our pre-eminence palatable to
the follower countries. Any courtesy we can offer
will help. Our money does not do this, because they
resent our being in the position to support them.
But if we can speak their languages, we show them

that we consider them important.
Perhaps the teaching of languages could be changed
to place more emphasis or»conversation, and the civili
zation back of the languages. Unfortunately, grammar
is necessary to adequate knowledge of any language.
But the results of knowing foreign languages can be
worth far more than the pain of learning them. We
hope we have proved just this.
