# Poor Reporting
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The sportsmanship displayed by the Stanford rooting
section at the Coliseum lust Saturday was creditable.
The sportsmanship displayed by The Stanford Daily
in reporting the game was not of the same high quality.
When one is the victor, it is unnecessary to employ
childish, imitative devices to degrade one's opponents.
It would have been a much more subtle slum simply
to have ignored Mr. Patrick Cannamela than to have
adopted the "gorilla" label first originated by Life
magazine.
1 rue, game spectators and radio listeners received
a definite impression (hat the Trojans were rougli
but not quite so rough as the Indians. True, we had
heard reports that Cannamela was out to "smear"
us. We were delighted when he was unable to do so.
While reading The Daily's account of the game, how
ever, we became slightly annoyed at over-l'requent
references to Cannamela "watching helplessly" and the
"Gorilla Caged.'' Since apparently he failed to impede
the Indians' progress, why devote an excess of good
space to his failure?
In addition, why imitate the scnsationalistic name
calling of some other publication?
We. us loyal Stanford rooters, agree with The Daily's
statement that "It took the teamwork and team spirit
lo pull the game out of the fire." But remember, it took
USC teamwork and team spirit to build up the fire.
