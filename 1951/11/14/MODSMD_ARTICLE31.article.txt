# Italians Are Poor in Finances, Rich in More Important Items
## 
### 
(This article by John Bush, former journalism stu
dent at Stanford, is the second and final installment
of hi* first newi letter from Italy.)
In my first article I listed pre-conceived notions that
travelers hove about Italy, and then exploded those
notions with what I have found while here. To con
tinue today:
1. 'Hie Italians are impoverished.
They are, and have been for a long time. We are
speaking of money, remember. They are a darn site
richer than any other nation I have seen in the things
that can't be bought. The average Italian laborer votes
Communist or Socialist, forgets about it, and has more
real fun than any American barfly with a Buick I
ever met.
2. Italy i* overpopu la ted.
True, and that is the root of her economic problems.
But «*ven the bambini who are dirty, poor and gesticu
lating are very nice and beautiful kids indeed. You
can hardly blame their parents for having them.
Hie way to *olve this, outside of science (which is
realistically almost impowdble) is by emigration. The
I lonntin** would be un h#m-I to America, were it

not for a discriminatory immigration quota. I aim
to write a Congressman or six.
Thf re is Lucky Luciano, but then there is J. P. Mor
gan. Take a look at the trial record of the latter and
then decide who got away with more.
!!. The Italian businessman and whatnot will rob
you blind.
There ought to be an international libel law. I! he
learns the ritual of bargaining, any literate person
ought to be able to rob an Italian blind, especially con
sidering the price level.
A few more remarks. These people are an old people,
and are beautiful, not cute like the French, among
whom I passed six delightful weeks:
They are warm, educated (yes. better than us),
intelligent and they like Americans, if they like any
"foresticri" at all. They are also a deep people. They
deserve a hell of a lot better break than they are
getting from both East and West.
But if I told the truth, all and nothing but, I would
fear for the population problem. Stanford's a nice
plnce, and I wouldn't like to see it turn into a ghost
town.

1. 'Hie Italians are impoverished.
They are, and have been for a long time. We are
speaking of money, remember. They are a darn site
richer than any other nation I have seen in the things
that can't be bought. The average Italian laborer votes
Communist or Socialist, forgets about it, and has more
real fun than any American barfly with a Buick I
ever met.
2. Italy i* overpopu la ted.
True, and that is the root of her economic problems.
But «*ven the bambini who are dirty, poor and gesticu
lating are very nice and beautiful kids indeed. You
can hardly blame their parents for having them.
Hie way to *olve this, outside of science (which is
realistically almost impowdble) is by emigration. The
I lonntin** would be un h#m-I to America, were it

not for a discriminatory immigration quota. I aim
to write a Congressman or six.
Thf re is Lucky Luciano, but then there is J. P. Mor
gan. Take a look at the trial record of the latter and
then decide who got away with more.
!!. The Italian businessman and whatnot will rob
you blind.
There ought to be an international libel law. I! he
learns the ritual of bargaining, any literate person
ought to be able to rob an Italian blind, especially con
sidering the price level.
A few more remarks. These people are an old people,
and are beautiful, not cute like the French, among
whom I passed six delightful weeks:
They are warm, educated (yes. better than us),
intelligent and they like Americans, if they like any
"foresticri" at all. They are also a deep people. They
deserve a hell of a lot better break than they are
getting from both East and West.
But if I told the truth, all and nothing but, I would
fear for the population problem. Stanford's a nice
plnce, and I wouldn't like to see it turn into a ghost
town.
