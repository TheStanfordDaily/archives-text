## Teamwork Wins the Games 
### BY "DIGGER" ODELL 
Being the conservative type, it wasn't until Saturday night in that ani
mated neon sign they call Los Angeles that we wore our Rose Bowl tie, the
iirst time it's been used since it was purchased three years ago. And il felt
good!
All of which means that the tie is off the market, not for sale, "kaput."
We've discovered that it >.'ives one a nice warm comfortable feeling to wear
it, Almost makes us forget the next two games. But not quite.
Everyone's on the bandwagon now and even we've stopped dragging
one foot, made heavy by Stanford teams full by the wayside for the past
two years. Sitting in the plush press box of the Coliseum Saturday after
the game, exhausted and limp, we couldn't believe what our smogstung
eyes hail just witnessed. In fart, it wasn't until we had read every sport
page between here and I.os Angeles that we were sure of what had taken
place.
In persuing the many sports pages we noticed that everyone had one
thing to say about the Iftdians in common. They all agreed that Stanford
had beaten USC—and had probably won their other games—by teamwork.
We're going to carry that a bit further, perhaps rashly, by saying that we
believe that Stanford has the only TEAM in the conference this year, and
that may in part account for the Card's win streak. We don't have to rely
on a Cannamela and Gifford combo, or a Cameron and Moomaw, or an
OJzsewski and Richter, or Heinrich and McElhenny. We could go on, there
are others on the rest of the teams, but these serve as examples.
Look what happened when Heinrich was laid up. Look what happened
when Johnny O was bowled over. And look what happened when Cameron
and Gilford were bottled up.
True, we've got the Pass, hut it's really been only a contributing factor
in all of our wins. When it's time for the Indians to run, they've got
Mathias. Hugasian, Cook, Meyers, and Laubscher, who are ready to go all
the way at any moment. When a pass is called, besides MrColl, there's
Storum, Morley, Hugasian, Cook. Meyers, Laubscher, and Mathias. As
for passing—well, Kerkorian got conked in the Santa Clara game and
liohb.v Garrett carried on quite respectably.
The greatest example, of course, of Stanford teamwork was the USC
game. Sure, some of the boys were mentioned more than others, but we're
.sure they'd all agree that it took the team as a whole to win. And not just
the first eleven on each platoon. The teamwork was strengthened by the fact
that the reserves carried their share of the load.
Take Skip Crist, for example. In for only a few minutes. Skip did his
share of the work, if not more. Another example; Wes Laubscher. We're
sure that Mathias would heartily agree that Laubscher deserves more than
a lit tie credit for his 96-yard TD run. Not only did Wes bump Gifford, the
last man, slowing him up enough to miss the crucial tackle, but Wes then
moved over and smeared defensive end Bill Hattig. who was in a position
to overtake Mathias. That's teamwork.
II it's teamwork that's going to put Stanford in the Rose Bowl, then it's
teamwork that's going to beat Oregon State this weekend. The Beavers are
no pushovers and a win over the Indians would make their season a raving
success.
It's like Chuck Taylor told the boys before the OSC scout report Mon
day. "If you want to go to the Rose Bowl, you'll have to get out and win
Saturday." That should be enough incentive for any team to play their
best ball. We hope it is.

GET IN AND FIGHT, LITTLE BROTHER—Oregon State comes up with
brother act Saturday. They're the Clark brothers and, interestingly enough,
they play side by side. Jim Clark, the oldest, stands 6 feet and weighs 235
pounds. He plays right guard. His "little brother,"' Herman, stands 6 feet,
2 inches, and tilts the scales at 265. Looks like Leon King, Cappy Cook, and
Jesse Cone are in for a little weight lifting this weekend.
