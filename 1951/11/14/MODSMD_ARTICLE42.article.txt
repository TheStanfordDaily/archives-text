# Cards Prep for Beavers
## 
### 
After hearing Mai Elward's scout |
report on OSC Monday night, the
varsity's defensive team got a prac- ,
i tical lesson yesterday afternoon as
the JV squad impersonated Oregon
| State in a scrimmage.
Eric Southwoocl, who has been j
i out with an injured knee since the
first play of the Santa Clara game, !
j was running full speed and indica- j
| tions are that he may see limited j
| action on Saturday. This is a fa- i
vorable factor, as Conch Chuck j
| Taylor will welcome Southwood's j
I speed and drive if Hugasian is ham-
I pered by his toe.

The Beaver attack that the de
fense was tackling is quite similar I
to the single wing attack that WSC j
featured against the Cards two j
weeks ago. They do not use as j
many power running plays, but |
feature at least as explosive a short
passing game.
The passing duties are shared by '
QB Gene Morrow, who throws from :
the T formation, and tailback Dave I
Mann, who tosses after a direct pass j
from center. Mann is also a hard- ;
driving runner, who is sent with
equal effectiveness off both sides in I
a Michigan-style running attack. j
