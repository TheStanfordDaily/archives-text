# Music Library Has Become A Leading Research Center
## 
### JEAN JOHNSON 
Thanks to the efforts of George
T. Keating and Nathan van Patten,
Stanford University i.s fast becom
ing a major center for musicological
research. '
The new catalogue of the Memo
rial Library of Music at Stanford
University lists 1,226 items of in
terest in musical history—holograph
scores and letters, first editions of
scores and of books on mu.sic, and
"association" items of various kinds.
The library, which is dedicated
to the memory of Stanford men
and women who lost their lives in
World War 11, is the product of
many years' research and collect
ing by Mr. Keating, a retired New
York business executive now liv
ing in Los Altos, and by Dr. van
Patten, Stanford professor of bib
liography.
Among the more than 300 original
manuscripts in the collection are
the complete scores of "Cavalleria
Rusticana," Purcell's "Te Deum and
Jubilate Made for St. Cecilia's Day,"

! an unpublished keyboard suite by
| Bach, Flotow's "Martha," and many
j others.
Musical scholars say that only
| the Library of Congress and the
| New York Public Library possess
richer collections of musical source
material.
An Eastern muvicographer has
been using the library for a study
on the different working methods
of composers — their processes of
composition and the various
changes which they make in a i
score.
Beethoven, for example, was a
notoriously sloppy musical cal
ligraphcr. His manuscripts arc
filled with scratchcd-out phrases,
corrections, an d improvements
upon the original drafts.
However, as it now stands, the
j collection is only the beginning of
! a plan who.-e goal is a library of'
j musical scholarship equal to those
of all the United States and of Eu- i
I rope.
