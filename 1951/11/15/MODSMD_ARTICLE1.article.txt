SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov. 14 (UP) — Gov. Earl Warren of
California announced today he is a candidate for President, thus
becoming the second Republican to enter the race for the 1952
GOP nomination.
"With all humility, I have concluded to become a candidate,"

the (>O-year-old three-time governor
told a crowded, press conference.
Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio an
nounced his candidacy a month ago.
Warren, who was the Republican
nominee for vice president in 1948,
said be would permit a group of top
ranking Republican leaders in the
state to submit his name in the Cali
fornia presidential primary but would
wait until the "proper season" to de
cide whether to urge his candidacy
in other states.
"There must, for the welfare of our
country, be a change in national ad
ministration, but if this is to be, the
Republican party must present a
definite constructive and workable
program for the nation. We cannot
hope to win solely on the mistakes
of the present 20-year administration,
many though they are," the governor
said.
Warren plans to outline his views
and opinions on national policy Fri
day night in a speech before a meet
ing of the Republican State Central
Committee at San Diego
Big "if's" may be the story of the
Warren candidacy for some time. The
biggest one, perhaps, is whether he
will pull out all the stops in a drive
for the nomination, as his statement,
implied or whether, in a final show
down he might accept the vice presi
dential nomination.
Warren's advisers insisted, how
ever, that he has no deals in mind;
that nc fully intends to campaign for
and try to win the top spot.
Warren, who calls himself a "liberal
Republican," was noticeably cool to
Taft's announcement of a candidacy.
