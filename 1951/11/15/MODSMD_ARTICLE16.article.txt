Elections are over. Twenty
eight per cent of the student
body went to the polls yester
day, cast 2,063 votes, and elected
seven persons to Excom and
Frosh class posts. This voting
turnout represents something of
a drop from last week's primary
in which 2,372 voted.
Most, of the contests were close,
going to the third ballot before being
decided. The only exception was the
race for Junior Excom, where Ron
Eadie won handily on the first ballot
with 187 votes.
As usual the Frosh were out in
front in representation at the polls.
With three Frosh offices to be decided,
766 frosh came out to vote. The
Sophomores managed to muster 352
at the voting booths, and they were
closely followed by the Juniors, with
347, and the Grads, with 329. The
Seniors brought up the rear; 269
voted.
The Frosh chose Fred Aurel presi
dent, Nancy Grimm Secretary-treas
urer, and sent Jack Fraser to Excom.

The other classes voted only for
excom representatives. The Gradu
ates, with only three men on the bal
lot after the last minute withdrawal
of Alan Root, chose Everett Clark.
The Senior excom race was won
by Bill Dickinson, who got his name
on the ballot by running as a write
in candidate in the primaries. He was
opposed only by Jerry Odens. This
contest was not decided under the
preferential system as only two can

didates were running.
Bob Rodolph came out on top for
Sophomore excom.
The preferential voting system
proved its worth again in yesterday's
voting. With only one exception, no
one was able to gather a majority of
the first choice votes. In a simpJo
one-vote election, this would have
meant that six of the candidate:;
would have been elected without
even a simple majority.
