The Alumni Office has been informed by the Athletic Officr
that all members of the Alumni Association will receive tickct
applications to the Rose Bowl game if Stanford is chosen to go.
All alumni who have paid their membership in full, or have
made their first installment payment, will be eligible to receive

ticket application priority blanks
under the Alumni Association classi
fication.
The alumni office will turn in
coming membership applications
over to the mailing division of the
Records Bureau as rapidly as pos
sible, where they shall be played
on the alumni ticket, application
mailing list.
However, graduates applying for
Alumni Association membership
who want tickets arc asked to send
in their applications as soon as pos
sible, as the Athletic Office will
have to close the mailing list very
soon.
When the ticket application forms
are .sent, out, alumni members are
urged to fill them out and return
them promptly with the proper re
mittance. (The cost of one ticket, is
set at $5.50 plus mailing charges.)
The Athletic Office and the
Alumni Office are returning all re
mi ttance.s received up to the pres
ent time, and alumni members are
asked not to order tickets until they
receive the proper forms.
