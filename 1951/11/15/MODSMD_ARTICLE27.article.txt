# Rooters Can Thank Team for Spirit
## 
### 
Good reports continue to come back from
Los Angeles concerning the football weekend.
Needless to say all hands were impressed with
Chuck Taylor's great team. Many Los Angeles
residents were also impressed with the show
ing of the Stanford students at large.
The pre-game rally at Lafayette Park is a case
at point. The city planning commission allowed
the park to be used as a rally site on condition
that there be no damage to the park.
Not a shrub was bent nor a flower bed
trampled Alumni Director Jack Shoup happily
reports. Los Angeles alumni who arranged for
use of the park were naturally pleased. It was
a good public relations job.

Lots of other bouquets could be noted to the
cheering section and cheer leaders for a fine
job; to the hundreds of drivers who managed
to make the trip down and back without killing
off a single Stanford rough or any other motor
ist; to the happy but thoughtful celebrants.
But before we as rooters knock ourselves out
patting our backs, one thought: The fine spirit
of the students is directly traceable to the mag
nificent spirit of the football squad. That's
where the real Stanford Spirit exists in this case.
Good players, good sportsmen, and a team in
every sense of the word, the Big Red is the
true origin of Stanford Spirit.
