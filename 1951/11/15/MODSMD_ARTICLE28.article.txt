# Huskies Give Writer a Shave
## 
### 
I'ootbali, freedom of the press and a free
shave are mixed up in a story from the Uni
versity of Washington campus.
Seems that Fred Delkin, until two weeks ago
sports editor of the Washington Daily, took a
few typewriter pot shots at what he termed
sdoppy blocking and other poor work on foot
ball fundamentals by Husky players.
Soon thereafter Delkin found himself pinned
down by a group of Husky players who pro
ceeded to shave him bald. On top of this em
harassment, Delkin ended up as an ex-sports
editor. He is now listed as a picture editor for
the Washington Daily, though a general staff

shakeup was announced about ihis lime.
A good natured man, Delkin still writes a
sports column now and then. A recent column
under the byline "Skinhead Delkin" termed
the Huskies the "Battered Barbers," and men
tioned his recent "clipping penalty."
What a silly situation when you get down
to it! We can hardly imagine Rod Garner, Jack
Bonetti and Leon King pinning down some hap
less sports writer and shaving him because they
didn't like what he said. It's no wonder Wash
ington has had such a disappointing season if
the team can't find anything better to do than
play barber.
