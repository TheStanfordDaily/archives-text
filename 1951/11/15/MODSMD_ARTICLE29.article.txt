### DICK McLEAN 
YAWNING . . .
Today's column is to be an experiment in auto
hypnosis. And YOU are to be the subject.
Before you finish reading this Bull Session, you
are going to yawn. As the words form sentences and
the sentences build into paragraphs and the Dara
i v?rr.y.r« < .v«>

graphs into thoughts, you are
going to notice a strange tickling
sensation in the base of your jaws.
As the impact slips from the con
scious mind into the subconscious
cavern of your brain, you will
feel a rubbery tension in the soft
muscles immediately under your
ears. A delicious convulsion will
ideze your jaws and pry them
apart slowly . . . slowly until
your ears pop and your teeth snap
I !U.._

back together again.
Why you can almost imagine how it is going to
feel! A nice relaxing yawn. What feels better in
the morning?
The causes of this oral phenomena are many. Prob
ably the most common reason is boredom. The best
way to greet your professor when he begins his lecture
is to give him what is termed "the hand over mouth
salute." This shows him that you await his every word
with pen ready to scoop up the dropping pearls of
wisdom. If he sees you render him this honor, he will
probably answer. Thus you and your teacher can
carry on a secret conversation all during class.
This salute need not l>e kept a student - faculty
thing. You can try it on your classmates. When the
lecture degenerates into statistics on how many
people lived in east Baltimore in 1741, you can look
across the room and give a silent, "This sure is dull"
to a buddy. Invariably he will answer.
Or, if you want, be sly! Yawn three times in the face
of the person sitting next to you. By your third yawn
his teeth will be beginning to spread too. Like the

tomtoms in the jungle the secret signal will move
down the row. A galloping yawn moves at the rate
of about two people per square minute. Therefore in
fifty minutes of class you can infect one hundred
people. Just think of the tremendous possibilities of
television.
Sleepiness is another cause of these involuntary
jaw spasms. When you wake up after a middle-of
the-week-date for an 8 o'clock class, it is often hard
to eat breakfast between yawns. I know of one girl
who was sleepily trying to hurry through her mush.
Something went wrong and her mouth snapped
shut before she could get the spoon out of the way.
Now she looks like the billboard pictures after the
kids have blacked out the teeth. (The mustache is
her own. however.)
As a rule, girls put yawning to better use than
biting off the ends of spoons. The favorite feminine
foil for warding off an over-eager boy friend is to
wait until she can feel his hot breath uncurling her
hair. Just when he moves in to play kissy face, she
yawns a fine, wide yawn. "Oh, I'm sorry," she apolo
gizes, "I'm teuribly tired. I had an exhausting date
last night. I think I'd better run on in. Bye." On the
way back to his car, her poor date thinks, "Wow! For
a minute there I was afraid she was going to bite me."
Another way that a yawn can be induced is by
suggestion. You can iust look at a picture of some
one about to yawn and feel the urge yourself. It's
a good feeling though. It's good to let your jaw cock
itself occasionally. A good yawn clears out your
brain and waters your eyes. Why one yawn usually
feels so good that you want to do it again. And
again.
Answer this question honestly, subject. Have you
yawned yet? Have YOU felt that rubbery tension
at the base of your jaw. Have you let the delicious
convulsion sie/.e your face?
Hmmmm?
If so, please cover your mouth.

salute." This shows him that you await his every word
with pen ready to scoop up the dropping pearls of
wisdom. If he sees you render him this honor, he will
probably answer. Thus you and your teacher can
carry on a secret conversation all during class.
This salute need not l>e kept a student - faculty
thing. You can try it on your classmates. When the
lecture degenerates into statistics on how many
people lived in east Baltimore in 1741, you can look
across the room and give a silent, "This sure is dull"
to a buddy. Invariably he will answer.
Or, if you want, be sly! Yawn three times in the face
of the person sitting next to you. By your third yawn
his teeth will be beginning to spread too. Like the

tomtoms in the jungle the secret signal will move
down the row. A galloping yawn moves at the rate
of about two people per square minute. Therefore in
fifty minutes of class you can infect one hundred
people. Just think of the tremendous possibilities of
television.
Sleepiness is another cause of these involuntary
jaw spasms. When you wake up after a middle-of
the-week-date for an 8 o'clock class, it is often hard
to eat breakfast between yawns. I know of one girl
who was sleepily trying to hurry through her mush.
Something went wrong and her mouth snapped
shut before she could get the spoon out of the way.
Now she looks like the billboard pictures after the
kids have blacked out the teeth. (The mustache is
her own. however.)
As a rule, girls put yawning to better use than
biting off the ends of spoons. The favorite feminine
foil for warding off an over-eager boy friend is to
wait until she can feel his hot breath uncurling her
hair. Just when he moves in to play kissy face, she
yawns a fine, wide yawn. "Oh, I'm sorry," she apolo
gizes, "I'm teuribly tired. I had an exhausting date
last night. I think I'd better run on in. Bye." On the
way back to his car, her poor date thinks, "Wow! For
a minute there I was afraid she was going to bite me."
Another way that a yawn can be induced is by
suggestion. You can iust look at a picture of some
one about to yawn and feel the urge yourself. It's
a good feeling though. It's good to let your jaw cock
itself occasionally. A good yawn clears out your
brain and waters your eyes. Why one yawn usually
feels so good that you want to do it again. And
again.
Answer this question honestly, subject. Have you
yawned yet? Have YOU felt that rubbery tension
at the base of your jaw. Have you let the delicious
convulsion sie/.e your face?
Hmmmm?
If so, please cover your mouth.

YAWNING . . .
Today's column is to be an experiment in auto
hypnosis. And YOU are to be the subject.
Before you finish reading this Bull Session, you
are going to yawn. As the words form sentences and
the sentences build into paragraphs and the Dara
i v?rr.y.r« < .v«>

graphs into thoughts, you are
going to notice a strange tickling
sensation in the base of your jaws.
As the impact slips from the con
scious mind into the subconscious
cavern of your brain, you will
feel a rubbery tension in the soft
muscles immediately under your
ears. A delicious convulsion will
ideze your jaws and pry them
apart slowly . . . slowly until
your ears pop and your teeth snap

back together again.
Why you can almost imagine how it is going to
feel! A nice relaxing yawn. What feels better in
the morning?
The causes of this oral phenomena are many. Prob
ably the most common reason is boredom. The best
way to greet your professor when he begins his lecture
is to give him what is termed "the hand over mouth
salute." This shows him that you await his every word
