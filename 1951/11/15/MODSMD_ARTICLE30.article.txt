# Nielsen Reports on Berlin

### PHIL NIELSEN 
(Phil Nielsen, who is on an ASSU exchange
scholarship at the Free University of Berlin, has
written a second letter describing his impressions
of Germany. This letter will be printed in two in
stallments, the next dealing with the University it
self and the challenge of teaching democracy
abroad.)

Never in my life have I experienced such an in
teresting city as Berlin. The tempo of life here is
altogether different from what throbs in West Ger
many.
My first acquaintance with conditions of th? city
was handled by none other than Klaus Vollmer, 1950-
51 ASSU foreign scholar from the Free University. It
appears to me that from his experiences at Stanford
he derived considerable understanding of American
character and outlook. Now he is finishing his work at
the University in Psychology and currently is leader
of a Boy Scout troop. His future hope is to work among
youth groups—a vital task among people who need
a new and positive approach to the rebuilding of
shattered values and disillusioned ideals.
Klaus, however, like other Germans who have
gontf to America, lives in the real fear of being kid
napped by the Russians, which would mean for him
at least 25 years in Siberia. When we ventured near
the busy trading center of Potsdamer Platz, juncture
of East and West Kectors, Klaus was quite uneasy.
Here are a few of the characteristics which I have
noted so far in the life of Berlin:
first of all, one sees the monstrous amount of ma
terial destruction, not only from air-raids, but also
from the savage house-to-house fighting. Nothing
was spared. I have stood and looked for blocks and
and have viewed nothing but rubble and ruins. Al
though the Germans are industrious and have managed
to rebuild and restore much, the work to be done is
unbelievably ureat in extent and cost.
Secondly, the scars and damages of the war are
grossly evident among the people themselves. It is
coirimon to meet daily on the street scores of maimed
and blinded people. In every streetcar, bus and train
there is a certain large block of seats reserved es
pecially for war-injured individuals.
Also immediately noticeable is the higher ratio of
women to men, for in the war as hifcji a* 75 per cent of

soldiers born in the same years lost their lives. This
fact means that many women are widowed or without
the possibility of marriage and many children no long
er have fathers.
Thirdly, the vast number of unemployed persons
are a drain on (be resources of the city. Approxi
mately one third of the labor force is without work.
Only when a refugee can prove that his life is
politically endangered in the East may be lie granted
the right to work in Berlin, and it is a fact that only
a minute percentage of all refugees finally gain this
right; the others can only live on the City dole, and
hope sometime to lie able to go to West Germany to
live and work.
One is further amazed by the spectacle of seeing
both young and old women doing heavy manual labor
such as building roads and clearing bomb damage.
Another characteristic sight is the large numbers of
German policemen everywhere. Day and night they
patrol the streets by foot and by car.
Lastly, one finds here among the people an intense
interest in politics. Almost the whole public life of
Berlin concerns politics e.g.. the newspapers, radio,
public speakers, signboard advertising, restaurant
and tavern conversation and student lunch-hour
discussions.
It has been my experience that the people are
anxious to question foreigners about their attitudes
toward Germans and current German problems and
about conditions abroad, particularly American opin
ion toward the USSR. Undoubtedly on account of their
dreadful experiences with the Russians during and
immediately after the war, the Berliners have a strong
and arousable hatred of the Reds.
I believe the Berliners are much more militant
against the Russians than b the population of West
Germany. Many Berliners are discouraged at the
lack of militant or decisive action by the City Gov
ernment in the fare of abuses by the Soviets or their
puppet East German "Volksdemokratie."
Berliners complain that in crises with the Russian*
the City Government floes nflthing but waste time
through democratic discussion and debate instead of
rising to the emergency with decisive, militant action.
Many Berliners l>elievr that Democracy as a political
system for dealing with Soviet tactics is doomed to
failure by its slowness in acting and by its disdaining
from projwigandiziiig and organizing the Youth.

coirimon to meet daily on the street scores of maimed
and blinded people. In every streetcar, bus and train
there is a certain large block of seats reserved es
pecially for war-injured individuals.
Also immediately noticeable is the higher ratio of
women to men, for in the war as hifcji a* 75 per cent of

soldiers born in the same years lost their lives. This
fact means that many women are widowed or without
the possibility of marriage and many children no long
er have fathers.
Thirdly, the vast number of unemployed persons
are a drain on (be resources of the city. Approxi
mately one third of the labor force is without work.
Only when a refugee can prove that his life is
politically endangered in the East may be lie granted
the right to work in Berlin, and it is a fact that only
a minute percentage of all refugees finally gain this
right; the others can only live on the City dole, and
hope sometime to lie able to go to West Germany to
live and work.
One is further amazed by the spectacle of seeing
both young and old women doing heavy manual labor
such as building roads and clearing bomb damage.
Another characteristic sight is the large numbers of
German policemen everywhere. Day and night they
patrol the streets by foot and by car.
Lastly, one finds here among the people an intense
interest in politics. Almost the whole public life of
Berlin concerns politics e.g.. the newspapers, radio,
public speakers, signboard advertising, restaurant
and tavern conversation and student lunch-hour
discussions.
It has been my experience that the people are
anxious to question foreigners about their attitudes
toward Germans and current German problems and
about conditions abroad, particularly American opin
ion toward the USSR. Undoubtedly on account of their
dreadful experiences with the Russians during and
immediately after the war, the Berliners have a strong
and arousable hatred of the Reds.
I believe the Berliners are much more militant
against the Russians than b the population of West
Germany. Many Berliners are discouraged at the
lack of militant or decisive action by the City Gov
ernment in the fare of abuses by the Soviets or their
puppet East German "Volksdemokratie."
Berliners complain that in crises with the Russian*
the City Government floes nflthing but waste time
through democratic discussion and debate instead of
rising to the emergency with decisive, militant action.
Many Berliners l>elievr that Democracy as a political
system for dealing with Soviet tactics is doomed to
failure by its slowness in acting and by its disdaining
from projwigandiziiig and organizing the Youth.
(Phil Nielsen, who is on an ASSU exchange
scholarship at the Free University of Berlin, has
written a second letter describing his impressions
of Germany. This letter will be printed in two in
stallments, the next dealing with the University it
self and the challenge of teaching democracy
abroad.)

Never in my life have I experienced such an in
teresting city as Berlin. The tempo of life here is
altogether different from what throbs in West Ger
many.
My first acquaintance with conditions of th? city
was handled by none other than Klaus Vollmer, 1950-
51 ASSU foreign scholar from the Free University. It
appears to me that from his experiences at Stanford
he derived considerable understanding of American
character and outlook. Now he is finishing his work at
the University in Psychology and currently is leader
of a Boy Scout troop. His future hope is to work among
youth groups—a vital task among people who need
a new and positive approach to the rebuilding of
shattered values and disillusioned ideals.
Klaus, however, like other Germans who have
gontf to America, lives in the real fear of being kid
napped by the Russians, which would mean for him
at least 25 years in Siberia. When we ventured near
the busy trading center of Potsdamer Platz, juncture
of East and West Kectors, Klaus was quite uneasy.
Here are a few of the characteristics which I have
noted so far in the life of Berlin:
first of all, one sees the monstrous amount of ma
terial destruction, not only from air-raids, but also
from the savage house-to-house fighting. Nothing
was spared. I have stood and looked for blocks and
and have viewed nothing but rubble and ruins. Al
though the Germans are industrious and have managed
to rebuild and restore much, the work to be done is
unbelievably ureat in extent and cost.

Germany. Many Berliners are discouraged at the
lack of militant or decisive action by the City Gov
ernment in the fare of abuses by the Soviets or their
puppet East German "Volksdemokratie."
Berliners complain that in crises with the Russian*
the City Government floes nflthing but waste time
through democratic discussion and debate instead of
rising to the emergency with decisive, militant action.
Many Berliners l>elievr that Democracy as a political
system for dealing with Soviet tactics is doomed to
failure by its slowness in acting and by its disdaining
from projwigandiziiig and organizing the Youth.
