# Farm Students Suffered When Lights Went Out
## 
### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
A roar of dismay arose at
11:05 Tuesday night from the
hallowed halls of Branner, Toy
on, Stern, and Crothers Halls as
j the lights went off.
The blackout, which was occa
[ sioned by repairs beino made on
one of Stanford's damaged power
lines, caught many students with
their lights on. Others, pre-warned,
l took advantage of the event to catch
, up on their sleep, which had suf
; ered since the USC tilt.
Some of the more studious Stan
fordites migrated to the Village to
j complete homework assignments,
I and stumbled into their residences
later that night in the pitch-dark
ness which was alleviated only by
j the flickering gleams of diverse
I candles and flashlights.
The afore-mentioned modes of
illumination were very popular
in the darkened balls, and many
of Palo Alto's drugstores were
I besieged in the early afternoon by
far-sighted students who bought
i candles by the dozen in prepara
tion for the coming night.
The power went on agnin at 2
a.m., distressing forgetful people
| who neglected to turn off their light
â–  switches and subsequently awoke
| to bright lights shining down on
( their sleepy faces.
Refrigerators at Branner and
Stern caused some trouble to re
pairmen. as they did not go on
twain when the power was tuvned
on. They had to be worked on for
an hour and a half after the
power line was fixed before they

started to function.
Final effects of the blackout were
observed as numberless students
clashed into their 8 o'clock* after
the final bell hud rung.
