# PRO AND CAHN

### 
It was only two weeks ago that we were so amazed with Stanford's foot- 1
ball fortunes that we coined the phrase HOW BOYS. And we asked the
questions: Just how good are the Indians? How far will they go? How
much can they come up with when pressed?
Last Saturday all the lIOWS were answered on the floor of the Coliseum.
We now feel that to ask one of the greatest bunch of footballers HOW they '
do it is downright gall and very insulting. They win because they are great
and because they have heart.
We could now call this 1951 squad the Heart Boys, the Poise Boys, the
Know How Kids, or dozens of other somewhat appropriate titles. But to
us they are deserving of only one name—THE STANFORD VARSITY'.
We were so proud of this gang Saturday that we can't hang a nickname
on them any longer. The true spirit and greatness of Stanford University
is exemplified in this STANFORD VARSITY. And the more we hear
or read STANFORD VARSITY, the more we burst with unexpressable
pride.
OREGON STATE AND CAL BOTH WILL LOSE
When the hands of the stadium clock point straight up for the fourth
time Saturday, Stanford will have beaten Oregon State and will be in the
Rose Bowl with no "ifs," "buts," or "howevers."
Such a statement might be called a rash case of overconfidence and be
looked upon with scorn and contempt by the more conservative. But even
the most severe skeptic will agree that if Stanford is not "fiat," Oregon State
should be no match. Let us assure that Stanford will not lie "Hat." In fact
they will be as high for the Beavers as lor any contest this year. When you
have an eight game winning streak behind you, a perfect seasun in sight,
and a cinched Rose Bowl bid all riding on one game, there is little chance J
of regarding the contest with unconcern.
Don't worry about the Beavers, the Indians will take things in stride |
1o the tune of about 28 to 13.
And now what of the California game.
Still 1 re: h in otir mind is t'hat seven-seven tie last year, when California
had an undefeated top team,, and Stanford was an also ran. It was Gary i
Kerkorian's arm that gave Stanford a draw with the big bad Bears. This j
year Stanford has an aerial circus unmatched in the nation. In addition |
Stanford possesses a running attack that is of note itself. And what does
California have? Why nothing but a bit better than average ball club.
Looks like the Axe comes home and in a big way.
SOME SHORT ODDS AND ENDS
We can't give too much praise to Dick Horn, stellar defensive back for j
Stanford. It was Dick wlio Saturday stopped USC's John Williams after he I
had broken into the clear on the opening kiekoff. And it was Dick who |
stopped A 1 Carmichael when he broke away with one blocker in front of ;
him. And it has been Horn who all season has been the "safest" safety man :
on the- Coast.
Also good going to Head Yell Leader, Tom Randolph who did a bang
up job at the Town House Rally Friday night and the game Saturday.
Did you happen to notice in the USC program that in views of the Stan
lord campus, the printer turned the Campus shot upside down in many of
the printed programs, while it was straight up in the other half?
MEMORABLE QUOTES OF A MEMORABLE WEEKEND
Friday night we ran into a friend at the rally down South. He told us i
that he really was gripped by the game fever. And in fact he was more
excited about the coming game than he was about the coming of Christmas
when he was a small boy. Quite understandable.
In the Sunday Los Angeles Examiner account of the game, the following
appeared. "In the first period USC had only one man covering Bill McColl. j
This was about as effective as using a napkin as a tarpaulin to cover Yankee
Stadium."
Following the most tremendous game we have ever seen, we joined in
the pandemonium and stumbled through the joyous Stanford rooting section.
Suddenly we ran smack into a fellow rooter, and knocked him a bit oil j
balance. When we begged forgiveness, he replied, "Do it again, wake me
up, I still can't believe I'm not dreaming."
It is rather a dream isn't it—but what a tremendous dream come true, j
