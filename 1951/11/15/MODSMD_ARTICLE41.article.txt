# Team Scrimmages for Beaver Tilt
## 
### 
Chuck Taylor put his charges |
through a short but rugged scrim
mage last night in preparation for
Saturday's Rose Bowl clincher with j
Oregon State in the local stadium.
The undefeated Tribe received a
jolt from Taylor Monday when he j
said that last week's tussle with
USC was a good game from an emo
tional standpoint, but that the tech- i
nical aspects, namely blocking and I
tackling, were poor. Therefore, the !
coaching staff has been stressing |
fundamentals all week.
Off of last night's drills, the In
dians have improved considerably,
their blocking being much sharper ]
and the defensive tackling rough â– 
and rugged. Joe Ruetz, who coaches
the defensive line, went through !
periods of despair and elation yes
terday. He was elated whenever he
saw one of his linemen with his
shoulder in a Brave stomach. The
Braves ran through Oregon State
single wing and T-formation plays,
and the varsity defense attempted
to put the clamps on them.
Meanwhile, at the other end of
the practice field the offensive unit
polished up their plays, both run
ning and passing. Reserve halfbacks
Wes Laubscher and Billy Heilbron
showed by their fong gainers in the

scrimmage that they can be counted j
on Saturday to carry their share of
the load.
Harry Hugasian and Eric South

wood spent the afternoon jogging
around the field getting in shape for
limited duty against the Beavers
this weekend.
