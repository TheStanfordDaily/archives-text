# Cards Should Murder Beavers If History Really Repeats
## 
### DICK CARTER 
When the Oregon State Beavers
take the field this Saturday against
the Indians they will
be trying for their second win in
the Stanford Stadium since the
Corvallis gridders began trekking to
Palo Alto some 27 years ago.
The Big Red IVlsuhine lias hold
a near-perfect >inx over the Bea
vers, winning l(i of the IS games
in Stanford Stadium, while losing
only one and tying one.
The over-all record reads a little
differently when the Indians' north
ern trips are considered. For since
the Stanford gridders have been
jaunting to Bell Fit Id, they have
been able to win only two of the
six contests played in Corvallis. 01'
the other four games, Oregon State
has won three, and one game ended
in a 0-0 deadlock.
Last year the Indians, paced by
Bill McColl, subdued the scrappy
Beavers on Bel! Field by a 21 to
(1 count. It was the first time in
2X years that the cardinal and
white had succeeded in snaring
the Beavev's pelt in their natural
habitat. Not since J 5)22, when the
Indians won a hard-fought con
test 6 to 0, had the Big Red been
able to eke out a win from the
tenacious Beavers on their home

field.
On Oregon State's last trip to Palo
Alto in 1941) the Indians inhospi
tably won 27 to 7, with a display
ol 'power that set the Beavers well
back on their heeLs. But this Sat
urday the story may be quite dif
ferent if the Beavers reach their po
tential greatness as they did against
the Washington Huskies just ttvo
week:; ago. Paced by such men as
Gene Morrow, Sam Baker, John
Thomas, and the Clark brothers,
Oregon State will prove a real test
for the Rose Bowl-bound Indians.
