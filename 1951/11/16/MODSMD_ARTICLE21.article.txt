# CARDS OUT TO CLINCH ROSE BOWL BID
## Reds High For OSC Crucial 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2, a squad of big, rugged, and fast
Oregon State Beavers will attempt to dam Stanford's winning
streak of eight straight football games.
Although much of the campus and San Francisco newspaper
men opine the game as already as good as won. Coach Chuck

Taylor, his staff, and the team ap
parently believe otherwise, as prac
tice has been carried on all week
with a vengeance.
It will take more than spirit if the
Cards come through with a victory on
thr morrow, for the Beavers have a
season record which shows they are
a tough nut to crack.
After holding Michigan State to a
fluke 6 to 0 victory and bowing to
USC in a tight 16 to 14 struggle, OSC
fell apart before Cal 35 to 14,
However, observers have since been
convinced that the Bear game was
the low point of the season, as the
Beavers bounced back to wallop
Washington 40 to 14, and play an
even stronger little UCLA team vir
tually even after allowing an early
first, period TD to lose 7 to 0
Salient points standing out in the
Beaver picture which point up the
fact the Cards will have to go Ml
out ere they may triumph tomor
row include the following:
On the offensive side OSC boasts
a two-pronged passing attack which
when functioning properly can keep
a defense off balance all afternoon.
The Beavers line up in a T forma
tion and either run straight off the T
or shift into a single wing ala Mich
igan and Washington State.
From the T, QB Gene Morrow
tosses them short and hard, or from
the single wing tailback Dave Mann
either runs or throws with equal
adeptness.
Mann, a soph, who has already been
compared with OSC's great Ken Car
penter of a couple of years back, has
a total offense record of more than
600 yards this year.
Rounding out one of the ninst
talented backfields on the coast i
l hard running Sam Baker at fuil and
probably Bill Anderson at wing
back. The sayings arc old, hut in
these cases most true that Baker
hits like a tank and Anderson can
i really turn the corner either in or
outside of tackle.
Up front a massive forward wnll
leads the way. The Beavers starting
offensive line averages 218 pound*
with Don Zarosinski. the lightest and
one of the toughest, at left, guard
weighing 185. At the other guard
weighing 235 is senior Jim Clark,
playing next to his behemoth of a
brother Herm, who offers 265 pounds
of beef at right tackle.
The ends, howe\ er, are probably
the strongest spots In the line. At
right is two-year-letterman John
Thomas, who was second in the PCC
i pass receiving last year. With all hu
effectiveness, Thomas hardly more
than matches left end Duane Helbig,
only a soph.
So much for the offense: the de
fense speaks for itftelf. Although
handicapped by the fact that sev
eral men have to go both ways,
including both the Clark broth
ers, the Beaver defense has
, stopped SC with less yardagp
than the Cards managed to hold
it to; kept "Hurrying Hugh" Slr-
Elhcnny from going anywhere;
and done virtually the same with
UCLA's Paul Cameron.
However, despite the Beaver
strength, all is definitely not lost for
the Cards.
How nccessary a win is to any
• future plans various optimistic cam
pus rooters and alums may have

made goes almost without saying.
Having come out of the SC
game unscathed, the Cards will
enter this game in almost perfect
physical shape. Only center Rod
Garner is a doubtful starter, since
his bad knee is impairing his ef
fectiveness.
Garner had a brace fitted for the
knee early this week, but he has
not been able to drive full steam
off it, and will in all probability he
held out against the Beavers if he
can't go 100 per cent. In his absence
Don Tobin and perhaps also A 1
Manner of the JV's will fill in.
In the line of appliances, Harry
Hugasian had a special shoe fitted
to house his broken toe.
However, the Hipster has not
seemed noticeably hampered in
practice, even with his injury.
In addition, half Eric Southwood
may see his first action since the
Santa Clara battle. Southwood has
been working out all this week and

! declares that his knee feels sound.
Saturday, by the way, is Bob
Mathias' 21st birthday, and the
training 1 table word is that the
team would really like a victory
to dedicate to the sensational full -
back, in much the same way that
the SC win came as a birthday
present to Garner on his 2lsrd last
Saturday.
All of which clears the way for
J a great game tomorrow afternoon.
The Beavers' threat has been out
lined; the Indians' spirit and power
have been viewed.
j Coach Chuck Taylor has predict
jed that Stanford will survive the
! trial with its ninth victory in a row;
J "but only," he warns, "if we play
' our best game of the year."

tice has been carried on all week
with a vengeance.
It will take more than spirit if the
Cards come through with a victory on
thr morrow, for the Beavers have a
season record which shows they are
a tough nut to crack.
After holding Michigan State to a
fluke 6 to 0 victory and bowing to
USC in a tight 16 to 14 struggle, OSC
fell apart before Cal 35 to 14,
However, observers have since been
convinced that the Bear game was
the low point of the season, as the
Beavers bounced back to wallop
Washington 40 to 14, and play an
even stronger little UCLA team vir
tually even after allowing an early
first, period TD to lose 7 to 0
Salient points standing out in the
Beaver picture which point up the
fact the Cards will have to go Ml
out ere they may triumph tomor
row include the following:
On the offensive side OSC boasts
a two-pronged passing attack which
when functioning properly can keep
a defense off balance all afternoon.
The Beavers line up in a T forma
tion and either run straight off the T
or shift into a single wing ala Mich
igan and Washington State.
From the T, QB Gene Morrow
tosses them short and hard, or from
the single wing tailback Dave Mann
either runs or throws with equal
adeptness.
Mann, a soph, who has already been
compared with OSC's great Ken Car
penter of a couple of years back, has
a total offense record of more than
600 yards this year.
Rounding out one of the ninst
talented backfields on the coast i
l hard running Sam Baker at fuil and
probably Bill Anderson at wing
back. The sayings arc old, hut in
these cases most true that Baker
hits like a tank and Anderson can
i really turn the corner either in or
outside of tackle.
Up front a massive forward wnll
leads the way. The Beavers starting
offensive line averages 218 pound*
with Don Zarosinski. the lightest and
one of the toughest, at left, guard
weighing 185. At the other guard
weighing 235 is senior Jim Clark,
playing next to his behemoth of a
brother Herm, who offers 265 pounds
of beef at right tackle.
The ends, howe\ er, are probably
the strongest spots In the line. At
right is two-year-letterman John
Thomas, who was second in the PCC
i pass receiving last year. With all hu
effectiveness, Thomas hardly more
than matches left end Duane Helbig,
only a soph.
So much for the offense: the de
fense speaks for itftelf. Although
handicapped by the fact that sev
eral men have to go both ways,
including both the Clark broth
ers, the Beaver defense has
, stopped SC with less yardagp
than the Cards managed to hold
it to; kept "Hurrying Hugh" Slr-
Elhcnny from going anywhere;
and done virtually the same with
UCLA's Paul Cameron.
However, despite the Beaver
strength, all is definitely not lost for
the Cards.
How nccessary a win is to any
• future plans various optimistic cam
pus rooters and alums may have

made goes almost without saying.
Having come out of the SC
game unscathed, the Cards will
enter this game in almost perfect
physical shape. Only center Rod
Garner is a doubtful starter, since
his bad knee is impairing his ef
fectiveness.
Garner had a brace fitted for the
knee early this week, but he has
not been able to drive full steam
off it, and will in all probability he
held out against the Beavers if he
can't go 100 per cent. In his absence
Don Tobin and perhaps also A 1
Manner of the JV's will fill in.
In the line of appliances, Harry
Hugasian had a special shoe fitted
to house his broken toe.
However, the Hipster has not
seemed noticeably hampered in
practice, even with his injury.
In addition, half Eric Southwood
may see his first action since the
Santa Clara battle. Southwood has
been working out all this week and

! declares that his knee feels sound.
Saturday, by the way, is Bob
Mathias' 21st birthday, and the
training 1 table word is that the
team would really like a victory
to dedicate to the sensational full -
back, in much the same way that
the SC win came as a birthday
present to Garner on his 2lsrd last
Saturday.
All of which clears the way for
J a great game tomorrow afternoon.
The Beavers' threat has been out
lined; the Indians' spirit and power
have been viewed.
j Coach Chuck Taylor has predict
jed that Stanford will survive the
! trial with its ninth victory in a row;
J "but only," he warns, "if we play
' our best game of the year."
Tomorrow afternoon at 2, a squad of big, rugged, and fast
Oregon State Beavers will attempt to dam Stanford's winning
streak of eight straight football games.
Although much of the campus and San Francisco newspaper
men opine the game as already as good as won. Coach Chuck

USC in a tight 16 to 14 struggle, OSC
fell apart before Cal 35 to 14,
However, observers have since been
convinced that the Bear game was

Salient points standing out in the
Beaver picture which point up the
fact the Cards will have to go Ml
out ere they may triumph tomor
row include the following:
On the offensive side OSC boasts
a two-pronged passing attack which
when functioning properly can keep
a defense off balance all afternoon.
The Beavers line up in a T forma
tion and either run straight off the T
or shift into a single wing ala Mich
igan and Washington State.
From the T, QB Gene Morrow
tosses them short and hard, or from
the single wing tailback Dave Mann
either runs or throws with equal
adeptness.
Mann, a soph, who has already been
compared with OSC's great Ken Car
penter of a couple of years back, has
a total offense record of more than
600 yards this year.
Rounding out one of the ninst
talented backfields on the coast i
l hard running Sam Baker at fuil and
probably Bill Anderson at wing
back. The sayings arc old, hut in
these cases most true that Baker
hits like a tank and Anderson can
i really turn the corner either in or
outside of tackle.
Up front a massive forward wnll
leads the way. The Beavers starting
offensive line averages 218 pound*
with Don Zarosinski. the lightest and
one of the toughest, at left, guard
weighing 185. At the other guard
weighing 235 is senior Jim Clark,
playing next to his behemoth of a
brother Herm, who offers 265 pounds
of beef at right tackle.
The ends, howe\ er, are probably
the strongest spots In the line. At
right is two-year-letterman John
Thomas, who was second in the PCC
i pass receiving last year. With all hu
effectiveness, Thomas hardly more
than matches left end Duane Helbig,
only a soph.
So much for the offense: the de
fense speaks for itftelf. Although
handicapped by the fact that sev
eral men have to go both ways,
including both the Clark broth
ers, the Beaver defense has
, stopped SC with less yardagp
than the Cards managed to hold
it to; kept "Hurrying Hugh" Slr-
Elhcnny from going anywhere;
and done virtually the same with
UCLA's Paul Cameron.
However, despite the Beaver
strength, all is definitely not lost for
the Cards.

Tomorrow afternoon at 2, a squad of big, rugged, and fast
Oregon State Beavers will attempt to dam Stanford's winning
streak of eight straight football games.
Although much of the campus and San Francisco newspaper
men opine the game as already as good as won. Coach Chuck

Taylor, his staff, and the team ap
parently believe otherwise, as prac
tice has been carried on all week
with a vengeance.
It will take more than spirit if the
Cards come through with a victory on
thr morrow, for the Beavers have a
season record which shows they are
a tough nut to crack.

How nccessary a win is to any
• future plans various optimistic cam

made goes almost without saying.
Having come out of the SC
game unscathed, the Cards will
enter this game in almost perfect
physical shape. Only center Rod
Garner is a doubtful starter, since
his bad knee is impairing his ef
fectiveness.
Garner had a brace fitted for the
knee early this week, but he has
not been able to drive full steam
off it, and will in all probability he
held out against the Beavers if he
can't go 100 per cent. In his absence
Don Tobin and perhaps also A 1
Manner of the JV's will fill in.
In the line of appliances, Harry
Hugasian had a special shoe fitted
to house his broken toe.
However, the Hipster has not
seemed noticeably hampered in
practice, even with his injury.
In addition, half Eric Southwood
may see his first action since the
Santa Clara battle. Southwood has
been working out all this week and

! declares that his knee feels sound.
Saturday, by the way, is Bob
Mathias' 21st birthday, and the
training 1 table word is that the
team would really like a victory
to dedicate to the sensational full -
back, in much the same way that
the SC win came as a birthday
