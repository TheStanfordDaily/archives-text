# From the Editor's Notebook

### 
About 450 California High School stu
dents will be on campus tomorrow for the an
nual High School Day. High schoolers from as
far away as Southern California will be here to
get an idea of Stanford life.
High School Day chairman Jack Harper and
his crew have arranged a full day of tours and
demonstrations for the visitors. Several faculty
members will speak to students who visit their
departments. Tours of student-run offices, such
as The Daily, will be included.
The High Schoolers will eat lunch at various
campus living groups. A friendly interest by
Stanfordites rather than a stony glare might
add much to our welcome, incidentally.
All High Schoolers will attend the OSC-
Stanford football game tomorrow afternoon.
Here's where the High School Day committee
walked into a ready-made situation. What
better way to show off Stanford's best than a
look at the undefeated Indian grid machine!
! Add to the "meanest trick I've heard of" list
jthe following: Four Big Game tickets have
been reported as stolen during the past week.
{
Once in a while an editor stumbles across a

really apt blend of words; a sentence or two
which expresses perfectly a significant idea.
Consider the following excerpt from the inau
ration speech made this fall by Cornell Uni
versity's new president, Deane W. Malott. We
quote from Time magazine:
"Fearful ones who hate and condemn the
liberalism in our colleges never suggest any
additions to the store ol human knowledge,
hut always subtractions. They want us to
leave out all that is interesting and vital, the
great social issues, the great controversies in
forms of government, systems of finance and
policies, and ethics. Such a course would not
mean free minds . . ."
The excerpt can be interpreted several ways.
As a warning, perhaps, to administrators and
influential alumni of all schools, that a uni
versity's main function is still the shaping of
"free minds"—free minds capable of intelli
gent thought, of course.
We like to regard it as a by word of the type
of school which encourages "additions to the
store of human knowledge" by the inclusion
of "great current social issues, the great con
troversies . . ." In short, those factors that
make a four year stay in college "vital and in
teresting."

departments. Tours of student-run offices, such
as The Daily, will be included.
The High Schoolers will eat lunch at various
campus living groups. A friendly interest by
Stanfordites rather than a stony glare might
add much to our welcome, incidentally.
All High Schoolers will attend the OSC-
Stanford football game tomorrow afternoon.
Here's where the High School Day committee
walked into a ready-made situation. What
better way to show off Stanford's best than a
look at the undefeated Indian grid machine!
! Add to the "meanest trick I've heard of" list
jthe following: Four Big Game tickets have
been reported as stolen during the past week.

Once in a while an editor stumbles across a

really apt blend of words; a sentence or two
which expresses perfectly a significant idea.
Consider the following excerpt from the inau
ration speech made this fall by Cornell Uni
versity's new president, Deane W. Malott. We
quote from Time magazine:
"Fearful ones who hate and condemn the
liberalism in our colleges never suggest any
additions to the store ol human knowledge,
hut always subtractions. They want us to
leave out all that is interesting and vital, the
great social issues, the great controversies in
forms of government, systems of finance and
policies, and ethics. Such a course would not
mean free minds . . ."
The excerpt can be interpreted several ways.
As a warning, perhaps, to administrators and
influential alumni of all schools, that a uni
versity's main function is still the shaping of
"free minds"—free minds capable of intelli
gent thought, of course.
We like to regard it as a by word of the type
of school which encourages "additions to the
store of human knowledge" by the inclusion
of "great current social issues, the great con
troversies . . ." In short, those factors that
make a four year stay in college "vital and in
teresting."
