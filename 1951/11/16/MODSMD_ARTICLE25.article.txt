# CAMPUS OPINION
## More Realistic Liquor Law 
### 
To the Editor:
As you probably know, the administration is ready
and willing to listen to any student proposal which
might be turned into a more workable and realistic
liquor law for minors than the one now in force in
California.
We as a group have come up with the following
proposal and would like to hear some student opinion
on it and/or other possible solutions to this thorny
problem.
1. An age minimum of 15) for beer and wine and 21
for hard liquor. ( A limit of 18 would meet the op
position of the school authorities since the California
school law requires attendance at school to the con
clusion of one's eighteenth year.)

2. Presentation of a drinking license before a minor
could buy liquor. Such a license would include a
photograph of the licensee to be issued by the state
contingent on presentation of a birth certificate and
evidence of parental permission (for the same reason
that consent of parents is required in a driver's license.)
The license would be revoked on the basis of unseemly
conduct traceable to liquor.
We believe the responsibility would continue to rest,
as it does now, with the persons who drink the drink,
buy it, and sell it.
