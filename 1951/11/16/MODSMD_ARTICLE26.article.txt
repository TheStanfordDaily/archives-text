## "CARD GRIDDERS SHOULD TRANSFER TO USC OR UCLA" 
### PETE GROTHE 
Today, by willful consent of the owners, this column
is turned over to Vincent X. Flaherty, who is sports
editor of the Los Angeles Examiner, a Hearst rag.

Flaherty doesn't, know he's writ
hing this column, but last Monday
the wrote a column that is an epic
'in sour grapes reporting, and I
think it is worth reprinting. If
you don't like what he says, let
him know. Many already have
written him letters. Now hear
Mr. Flaherty:
\ "Jess Hill. USC's very success
ful coach, said something early
Saturday evening which should

jplacate all Southern California rooters.
"He had just lost his first game as a major coach.
According to script. Jess should have been under
! going the tortures of the darned, or that other word.
But Jess was matter of fact when his Trojans lost
to Stanford. 'The world's not coming to an end or
he said. And it didn't either.
. . . But here, there should be no deep sorrow.
There should be no half-masting of flags or the hang
ing of crepe. A local team won!
' A local team known as Stanford defeated USC.
And Stanford's football team is made up of 27 South
' ern California boys.
Well, there is Kerkorian from Inglewood, and Hu
>gasian from Pasadena, and Horn from Santa Monica,
and McColl from San iDego, and Sam Morley from
San Marino and on down the line. They looked good
.with Stanford. From a purely home-town standpoint,
they'd look better with USC or UCLA.
... In other words. USC and UCLA are being
taken advantage of in a dreadful fashion. USC has
" only three men from Northern California and Stan
ford has 27 from here.
But a hometown boy always wants to get away. He
wants to get out on his very own and scratch around
Vor the first time and make his declaration of in
dependence from Mom and Pop.
lie doesn't pause to ponder the possibility that
he'd Ik* much better off in his own community

where, some day, he must come back and make a
living. He doesn't appraise the possibility that he.
by staying home, and playing his football at home,
might build up a certain amount of fame and pres
tige that can he cashed in on in years to come
Glendale's Frankie Albert is an example. He be
came an All-American football player at Stanford, and
became a foreigner in his own home. He became a
great pro quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers,
and became another of many great pro players—one of
the crowd, nothing more.
There isn't anything Albert did at Stanford that
he couldn't have done at USC or UCLA—only it
would have lasted longer and ridden with him
straight through his life,
Jim Reynolds, the modest Stanford man, has sent
more good players up-state than any other man—and
at considerable expense. I do not know how many of
those 27 Southern Californians Jim might have sent to
Stanford, but you can bet he sent most of them.
It's difficult to figure what California and Stanford
would do without its drain on this area. Certainly,
if USC and UCLA got the same boys, the only contest
would be right here.
As they are, UCLA and USC rate high in Coast
Conference football—so high that they might wind up
in a tie with Stanford for the run to the Hose Bowl
within the next two weeks.
The Bruins and Trojans are corkers, as college
football teams go. When they meet here on the 24th,
they'll play before a sold-out Coliseum.
Both have exciting football teams. Both play the
game as it should bo played. Either team is capable
of arising to an occasion and might boff over the best
team in the country. But this year, there isn't a
standout team—not even Tennessee with its mediocre
schedule.
But do not sorrow. There's going to be a great
homecoming on New Year's Day.
Twenty-seven Stanford Indians are coining home
to play in the Rose Bowl. They'll get knocked off by
Iliinois, whereas they might have flattened Illinois
in the first place if they had stayed home and played
for UCLA or USC.
It's okay to share the wealth, bvit it cannot be spread
thinly throughout the realm."
