# UCLA Admits Cheating, Says Bruin Paper
## 
### 
Nearly half of the students at j
UCLA have admitted they cheat!
This information was revealed in j
the UCLA Daily Bruin last week
with the publication of the results
! of a poll taken on cheating by the
| Westwood students.
Results of the questionnaire, ]
given last spring by the UCLA Bu
reau of Student Opinion, show that
49 per cent of all students inter
viewed admitted "active" cheating
in the last year, and an additional
17 per cent admitted cheating at
some time at UCLA, although not
in the past year.
"Active" cheating was defined as !
cheating in which the person's I
grade could be improved, as by
copying, cribbing notes, or turning
i in someone else's term paper.
The person most likely to cheat ,
at UCLA, said the Bruin, is a 1
nun - veteran undergraduate stu
dent under 2! years old, majoring
in business administration, edu
cation, or one of the biological
sciences.
Furthermore, he is most likely to
be in a fraternity or a sorority, and
, he is in some phase of student gov
: eminent or intercollegiate sports.
The greatest factor involved in
the poll was the student's status.
Fifty-seven per cent of the under
! graduates were found to have
: cheated, as opposed to only 17 per
' cent of the graduate students who
| participated in the poll.
On the heels of this information
j came pronouncements from the
I Dean of Students and members of
the UCLA faculty on the problem.
Said the Dean, "In the light of
less comprehensive studies, the
figures are not startling, but noth
ing to be proud of."
Other professors were skeptical.
The chairman of die business ad
ministration department, where the
incidence of cheating was highest,
explained that it would be noces
■ sary to look into the results more
: carefully, as such things are hard to
I evaluate.
I "A more fair sampling of opinion
t would be needed," he added. "From
• my own experience, it would seem
! that the reports are somewhat ex
j | aggerated."
Philosophized Dr. Hans Meyer
hott' of the philosophy department,
j "The pressure of our society is too
great. It is a nice example of the
characteristic of our society. The
! university merely reflects the
! price that an individual has to
pay in order to come out on top."

49 per cent of all students inter
viewed admitted "active" cheating
in the last year, and an additional
17 per cent admitted cheating at
some time at UCLA, although not
in the past year.
"Active" cheating was defined as !
cheating in which the person's I
grade could be improved, as by
copying, cribbing notes, or turning
i in someone else's term paper.
The person most likely to cheat ,
at UCLA, said the Bruin, is a 1
nun - veteran undergraduate stu
dent under 2! years old, majoring
in business administration, edu
cation, or one of the biological
sciences.
Furthermore, he is most likely to
be in a fraternity or a sorority, and
, he is in some phase of student gov
: eminent or intercollegiate sports.
The greatest factor involved in
the poll was the student's status.
Fifty-seven per cent of the under
! graduates were found to have
: cheated, as opposed to only 17 per
' cent of the graduate students who
| participated in the poll.
On the heels of this information
j came pronouncements from the
I Dean of Students and members of
the UCLA faculty on the problem.
Said the Dean, "In the light of
less comprehensive studies, the
figures are not startling, but noth
ing to be proud of."
Other professors were skeptical.
The chairman of die business ad
ministration department, where the
incidence of cheating was highest,
explained that it would be noces
■ sary to look into the results more
: carefully, as such things are hard to
I evaluate.
I "A more fair sampling of opinion
t would be needed," he added. "From
• my own experience, it would seem
! that the reports are somewhat ex
j | aggerated."
Philosophized Dr. Hans Meyer
hott' of the philosophy department,
j "The pressure of our society is too
great. It is a nice example of the
characteristic of our society. The
! university merely reflects the
! price that an individual has to
pay in order to come out on top."
Nearly half of the students at j
UCLA have admitted they cheat!
This information was revealed in j
the UCLA Daily Bruin last week
with the publication of the results
! of a poll taken on cheating by the
| Westwood students.
Results of the questionnaire, ]
given last spring by the UCLA Bu
reau of Student Opinion, show that
49 per cent of all students inter
viewed admitted "active" cheating
in the last year, and an additional
