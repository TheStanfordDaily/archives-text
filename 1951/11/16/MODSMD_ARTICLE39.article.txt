## 
### DICK CARTER 
Crothers football team swept to
! an impressive 26 to 0 win yester
| day over the Frosh Medics, led by
I the sterling running and passing of
their speedy tailback Oilie Norville.
I The Lawyers took control of the
} game early in the first quarter on a
series of plays which set up a. pass
on the Medics' 10-yard line from
Norville to Miles Ruben in the end
zone.
Neither team scored the rest of
the first half, but in the second
stanza the Doctors were unable to
! stem the drives of the Crothers
! team as they pushed to three more
j touchdowns. Throughout the game
| the medical students were unable
j to make a sustained drive to match
I the Crothers scoring punch.
After an exchange of punts in
j the first half, the Lawyers took
! over the hall at the midfield after
I a nice punt runback by Norville.
| From here on successive passes to
I Charley Cole and Fred Steincr
I by Norville they drove to the
i Meds' 44.
Norville took the ball again and
I fading to pass could find no receiv
| er open: he elected to run, moving
j all the way to the 24-yard line be
| fore he was tagged.
A quick pass to Charlev Cole and
some fine broken field l-unning on
his part brought the ball to the 10-
yard line where Steiner caught the
pass for the TD. The conversion
was no good, and the score stood 6
to 0 for the Lawyers.
The Medicse took the kickolT
and passed (he hall to the midfield
stripe in two plays. At this point
Dave Sachs faded deep and beintr
rushed hard threw a high looping
i pass which TufTanelli nabbed with
j a circus catch on the Crothers
| 15-yard line.
Then a run by Saclis resulted in
j a fumble with Lawyer Charlie Cole
recovering. The Medical students
| never penetrated this deep again
j during the game.
Early in the second half, after a
I series of unsuccessful drives by both
teams, Sachs faded to pass for th?
! Medics on his own 20. Lawyer Cole
knifed in from his secondary spot to
intercept the pass at midfield and
taking advantage of excellent
! blocking ran and faked his way to
| the goal line for the second Croth
j ers score.
The point after touchdown pass
! was blocked, making the score 12
' to 0.
The Lawyers scored again swiftly
when they gained possession of the
ball on the Medics' 22-yard line. A
j Norville pass to blocking back
Frank Farella in the end zone on
j the first play accounted for the third
touchdown, and Norville ran to the
conversion around right end to
make the score 19 to 0.
The final Crothers counters came
in the final minutes as Fred Steiner
! climaxed a long drive by the Law
yers catching a 15-yard pass in the
end zone to make the score 25 to 0.
A quickie pass across the center
of tlie line into the arms of Char
ley Cole scored the conversion,
completing the 2fi to 0 rout.
In the only other game of the day
the Alpha Sig team scored a 7 to t>
win over Kappa Alpha. The Alpha
Sigs got their only touchdown on a
long pass from Bill Gonser to Bob
Pickett.
