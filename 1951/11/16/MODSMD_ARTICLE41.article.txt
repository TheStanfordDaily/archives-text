# TOMORROW
## Soccermen To Host SFS 
### 
Stanford's soccermen will host
San Francisco State tomorrow
morning in a game which could
well decide the Cards' chances for
the league championship.
State edged the Cards 4 to 2 in a
game played earlier in the season in
Cox Stadium in San Francisco, but
the Farm booters served notice they
will be tough to scalp twice when
they routed CCSF last weekend in
the City 6 to 1.
In Top Shape
Should the Cards lose tomorrow,
they would be virtually eliminated

from title contention; but a win
would keep their chances very
much alive.
Stanford will face the Gators in
! about its best physical shape all
I year. Co - captain Harry Havilio,
| who has been playing at only part
i effectiveness throughout the season
I because of a sprained ankle, reports
I that he can finally depend on his
i joint for full drive.
Ready to Go
The rest of the Card injured ap
j pear well again also. Center half
| Derek Liecte, left inside Sam Sua
rez, and right inside Reuben Ave-
I sian are ready to play.
This week the Indians scrim
' maged hard Monday, Tuesday, and
i Wednesday, and tapered off yester
-1 day in grim preparation for State.
At the close of practice last night
Coach Russ Latham went out on a
! limb by predicting, "With our best
i game we can take them."
