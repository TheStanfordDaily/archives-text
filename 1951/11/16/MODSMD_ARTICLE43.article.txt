# STANFORD POOL.
## Water Poloists Gunning For Unbeaten Record in Cal Go 
### 
Stanford's water polo team will attempt to make Farm aquatic
history when they tangle with Cal in the annual Big Splash to
morrow morning at 10 in the local pool. If they can beat Cal it will
mark the first time that the team was ever undefeated in PCC play.
The team breezed past the Bears 5 to 0 in an early season con-

test, but Cal lias improved as their j
recent close losses to COP and |
UCLA attest. COP and UCLA are I
two of the three top teams on the
Coast; but there is no reason that [
Stanford, the other top team, can't
defeat the Bears also.
Tonight in San Francisco, the
team's perfect record will be in
worse jeopardy when they meet the
powerful Olympic Club in a non
conference tilt. They topped the
OC in a double-overtime thriller in I
their last meeting and the club fig
ures to be even tougher in their
own pool.
Coach Tom Haynie will undoubt
edly start his regular line-up of
Bob Wyckoff, Bob Frojen, and Jim
Gaughram at forwards, Bert Holi- ;
day, Ash Jones, and Mel Butler at I
backs, and Russ La Telle in the
goal in both games. The Boar tilt !
will mark the final game for Fro- :
jen, Wyckoff, and LaTelle.
The team unanimously agreed
that the larger the turnout, the bet
ter their effort would be against the
Bears.
