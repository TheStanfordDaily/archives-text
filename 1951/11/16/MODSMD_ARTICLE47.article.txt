## 
### 
"This year is a great time to be graduating and seeking a job,"
stated Eugene Dils, head of the Placement Service. With the na
tional economy pointed toward production of a normal supply
of "butter" as well as "guns," there is a strong demand for the
college graduate, especially in the engineering field.

According to Dih this situation
frequently presents the problem of
selecting the company and indus
try which most closely fits the de
sires of the student. He said, "The
consideration of high wages should
definitely not assume the predomi

nant factor in the decision of the ;
grad."
Engineers Needed
Dils also added that the condi
tions in the engineering field dur
ing the '50's is one of scarcity of
engineers, whereas during the '30's
there was a scarcity of jobs. This
situation naturally means there will |
be more representatives from em- ]
ploying companies on campus this ;
year than ever before.
Sixteen company recruiters have
already visited the campus this
quarter. There are 19 industry re
cruiters planning to come before
Christmas. These men usually see !
December and March graduates. I
They will also see June grads, al- !
though many will be making the
rounds again in the spring prima
rily for them.
Evaluating a Job
Seniors and graduate students
are advised, therefore, to evaluate ,
carefully job offers in terms of their
personal and ultimate objective, j
The following ways of doing this j
were suggested by the Placement
Service:
(1) Talk with the company rep
resentative; (2) consult your major
professor regarding history of for
mer students employed with that !
firm; (3) read the material on file J
in the Placement Service and Vo- j
cational Guidance libraries about
company training programs and
other aspects of employment. These j
libraries are located in the Stu
dent Counseling Center.
Placement Service members say
they will be glad to discuss fur
ther questions concerning job
