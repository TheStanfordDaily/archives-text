# CARDS TOP OSC-THERE'S STILL CAL
## Indians Unleash Biggest TD Flood This Year for Beavers 
### JIM MADISON 
Stanford's varsity footballers Saturday unleashed their biggest
flood of touchdowns this year to drown OSC's Beavers in a 35 to
14 win that as good as made an appointment for the Indians for
New Year's in the Rose Bowl.
After early sputtering on both sides and two Stanford first-guar-

tcr drives, one of which resulted in
a TD, the first half evened up on
the old-fashioned sleeper play by
the Beavers late in the second quar
ter, and thus did the scoreboard
read at half-time, 7 to 7.
The Cards gave the same impres
sion in the first half that they had
all season of having the game well
under control, but the heavy pre
ponderance of Stanford rooters
among the 40,000 odd spectators
were much relieved when the Cards
were able to capitalize on two
breaks, one cach furnished by the
defensive and offensive platoons, to
burst to a 21. to 7 lead soon after
the third period opened.
It all started innocently enough
with two of the Cards' five fum
bles in the game coming in the
first four minutes of the opening
period, each one giving the Bea
vers a golden opportunity within
the Stanford TO.
But OSC got nowhere on either
of their series of downs, and the
third time the Cards got the ball,
they opened np to go all the way
from their 44 to the Beaver end
zone in ten plays.
The big gainers were a beautiful
pass from Kerkorian to Mathias,
good for 2(i yards, and a 15-yard de
layed buck by the plunging fullback
which carried the drive all the way
to the six.
Ilarry Hugasian, who drove as
hard as anyone else on the field
during the limited time his injured
toe allowed him to stay, carried
it over on the third rrark at the
middle of the OSC line, and Ker
korian converted to make the
score a eomnetcnt-looking 7 to 0.
In the middle of the second pe
riod the Cards looked as though
they were going to do it again, when
they began to punch gaping holes
in the left side of the Beaver de
fensive line. Meyers exploded with
some slashing running (his day's to
tal finally reached 116 on 19 carries)
to go over the same hole between
left end and tackle four consecutive
times for 33 yards. However, the
Beavers finally held on downs.
The lone OSC tally in the open
ing half came in the second period
after the Beavers had marched to
the Card 28 from their own 29, all
the eßavers late in the second quar
took the ball from the T and the
play began to look like a reverse
around left end.
However, Beaver left end
Duanc Helbig blocked "on count"
on the line, then after Card de
fensive right half Boh Thompson
came up to hack up against the

fake run. slipoed into the end
zone all bv himself and cauftht a
strike from Morrow for six points.
Jim Cordial converted to make
the halfway score 7 to 7.
Immediately after the second half
got under way, there were some
changes made on the scoreboard.
Norm Manoogian, offensive guard,
doesn't get to make many tackles,
but, running down under a Dick
Horn punt, he jarred Beaver safety
man Gene Taft with one just as the
| latter bumped into his own Dave
! Mann.
Taft fumbled into the arms of
Owen Powell, who had played at
the other guard since the first quar
ter for the injured Jack Bonetti.
On the first play from scrimmage,
Ben Cook tore through a hole
ripped open by Manoogian, and
wont all the way for a 13-yard
touchdown run, aided by hard
downfield blocks by renter Don
Tobin and tackle John Broderick.
Kerkorian again converted.
The crowd had no more recov
ered its breath from cheering the
score, than the Cards did it again.
Chuck Kssegian reached up an
ami to pick a Dave Mann pass out
of the air on the Beaver 35 and
returned it 15 yards.
After Meyers swept end for nine
of the yards, Mathias began churn
ing. On the fourth play thence from
the two-yard line, the Tulare im
port scored the first of liis two
birthday touchdowns. He cracked
left tackle for the score. Kerkorian
converted for the third straight
time.
Left end Sam Morley duplicated
J his key play of the SC game, when
| he made a great ovcr-the-shouldcr
catch of a Kerkorian pass good for
33 yards to the OSC 21, .'etting up
the fourth Stanford scorc.
The Cards drove to the eight,
| whore Mathias carried over on his
hardest run of the day. He smashed
left guard, found no hole, slipped off
left tackle, ran right over Beaver
Yale Rohlff, and churned into the
end y.one carrying three tackle vs.
, Kerkorian converted, and the scov
j began to look like a rout, 28 to 7.
On the succeeding kickoff. Card
safety Dick Hcvn saved Stanford
n Beaver touchdown. Taft had
fielded the kick, hit a hole on the
right, and led bv several Mock
ers appeared headed for the
races.
Hut Horn handed off the block
ers, running almost as fast back
| ward as Taft did forward, until
j finally on the Card 15 he had
