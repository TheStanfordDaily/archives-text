### 
Rose Bowl rooters' tickets will
presumably cost 52.75, Stanford
Athletic Director A 1 Masters said
yesterday.
Though no plans arc yet definite,
if Stanford is chosen lor the Bowl
rooters' tickets will probably be
sold on a "buy at Stanford, pick up
at Pasadena" basis. Masters ex
plained that the student will pav the
money here before the end o£ the j
quarter, sign a card, then pick up
the ticket at Pasadena any time
after Dec. 26 or 27, after signing the
same card again.
"This procedure will eliminate }
most non-students from the rooting j
section. Michigan adopted the plan J
last year with great success," Mas- \
ters explained.
The PCC Rose Bowl represen
tative will he announced Nov. 26 j
after a telegraphic vote from all 1
conference schools. Each school
will have a code name, such as
pickle for Stanford or cheese for i
Cal. Official school representa- j
fives will send the single code
word designating their vote to the
I,os Angeles office via telegraph.
Code names are a device to in
sure secrecy.
Masters said the $2.7."> price figure I
is based on the PCC-Big Ten eon

tract which states that student tick
| ets can bo sold for no lesr. than half
I the amount of regular seats, which
j arc $5.50 for the Rose Bowl.
Students will be allowed to buy
one rooter's ticket, and Masters said
he hoped an arrangement similar to
Big Game policy could be worked
out for parents' tickets. This would
mean parents not in alumni classi
fications could apply for two t.inkH:.
provided they promised to use
j personally.
Alumni members will probably he
allowed to apply for four tickets,
but in one classification only.
Masters emphasized that all plans
; arc tentative. "Our over-all idea i-;
| to be fair to all but keep scalping
j to the minimum," he said.
! Masters estimated that 400 to ."<OO
Bowl ticket applications came in
last week, but all arc being r« -
| turned. "We will send out apph
i cations ourselves if and when we're
named to go. Nobody should end
: in applications either now or later,"
| he said.
