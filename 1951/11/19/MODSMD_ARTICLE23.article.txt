FABLES OF THE GAME
Big Game is only five days off and the scent of the
autumn wind is football. There are many legends
and fables of the great game, some of the legends
funny, some sad. Let me recount one of each today.
I can't claim authorship for these but I've heard them
told so many times that for u byline I'd have to put
"Anonymous." So for whatever they are worth, I

give them to you.
The first is a funny one that the
priest told me after Mass two Sun
days ago.
It seems that there was an old
priest at Notre Dame who used
to he~r the confessions of the
football players. He was a fine
old Irishman, respected and
loved by all. He had one pe
culiar custom though. He used
to mark on his black sleeve with
a piece of chalk while he heard

confessions. A quick examination of the striped
sleeve would tell him how severe the pcnnance
should be.
Early one Monday morning the priest heard a knock
on his door and opened it to a mountain of a tackle.
The lumbering lad, a Polish boy of two hundred and
fifty pounds, paused in the doorway and then said,
"I'd kind of like to go to confession, Father."
"Certainly, iuy son," answered the priest as he
sat down and took out his piece of chalk.
"Well Father," stammered fhe tackle," in last Satur
day's game I deliberately ran over a halfback's hand.
It was dangling kind of loose on the field and I was
rtearby and . . ."
"Oh. my son." tsked the priest. "You know that it's
not right to deliberately maim your brother." The
old Irishman made three thick marks on his sleeve.
"That's not all. Father. On another play I de
liberately broke a man's nose with my knee."
"My boy!" wailed the priest. "You know that it's
a sin to want to injure someone." The Father put
four more marks on his black sleeve.
The huge lad hung his head and in a tone barely
audible said," On one play after I tackled a man. I
bit him In the ear."
The good priest gasped and chalked up five more
bars. The marks reached nearly to his elbow.

"And who were you playing on last Saturday?"
asked the venerable Irishman.
"Southern Methodist University, Father."
"Oh well, now," said the priest with an Irish
twinkle in his eyes as he jauntily brushed the chalk
bars from his sleeve," I guess that boys will be boys."

The following story was told to be as a true one.
Whether truth or fiction, it still leaves a lump in my
throat every time that I hear it.
There was a third string fullback named Johnson
who attended a large mid-western university. He was
a quiet boy who played a solid but not outstanding
game. Whenever he played, he did well but still
lacked that certain fire that makes a great fullback.
The coach always liked him because he noticed
that when the boy's father visited the campus, the
two walked arm in arm. The coach being a family
man thought this was a fine thing. When be could,
the coach listed Johnson's name on the traveling
roster.
On the night before the biggest game of the season
the boy came to his coach and said, "Sir, I've got to
start tomorrow."
"I'd like to, Johnson," answered the coach, "but
this is the most important game of the year."
"I know that, sir, and I know that I'm not good
enough but tomorrow will be the first time my Dad
will see me play."
The coach thought for a minute and then said,
"Okay. But I can only leave you in for a few seconds."
"Thank you. sir," said the quiet boy and left.
The coach was a little surprised because the full
back bad never asked for anything before.
Johnson started at the fullback position the next day.
And what a day that was! A spark inside the gangling,
quiet boy seemed to take life. From the opening
whistle till the closing gun the only word heard over
the public address system seemed to be "Johnson."
The boy who was only going to be allowed to play
a few seconds played 58 minutes. And for 58 minutes
he had been great.
In the locker room the happy coach said to him,
"I'll bet your dad was sure proud of you today."
"I hope so," answered Johnson.
"What do you mean?" asked the coach.
"Dad was blind," said the boy. "And he died yes
terday morning. And today is the first time that he
could see me play."
