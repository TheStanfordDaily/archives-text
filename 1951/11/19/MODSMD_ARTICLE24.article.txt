# DRAFTEES ADVISED
## Dr. Black Suggests That Men Study Army Jobs 
### 
Sooner cr later all Stanford
men may have to face miltary
service. If they know what they
want to do when they enter the
service, they will have a better
chance to make a success of
their time in active duty.
This is the opinion of Dr. John D.
Black, director of the Counselim*
and Testing Center. He and other
workers at the center recently in
spected classification and assign
ment procedures at the Fort Ord re
ception center.
The draftee who knows the kind
of assignment he wants in the
Army has a pretty good chance
of getting it if it has anv relation
ship to his training, experience,
or aptitudes; the man who doesn't
express a realistic choice will
probably receive whatever as
signment is most expedient, the
inspecting group decided.
The Army's battery of intelligence
and aptitude tests, which used to
require about three hours, now
takes a full day. Tests cover vir
tually all abilities known to be re
lated to military jobs. Extensive
tables have been developed show
ing the combinations of aptitudes
required for different miiltary as
signments.
Students with training in engi
neering, and the sciences have

greater assurance of getting jobs
closely related to their civilian
vocations than those majoring in
the arts, humanities, and social
sciences. However, there are in
teresting assignments for which
the non-scienc? ma.iors arc eli
gible if thev know enough about
these opportunities to express a
piefercnce.
Since opportunities for officer
training are severely limited except
for those desiring to become line
officers, many college students will
be better off seeking non-commis
sioned and specialist ratings in pref
erence to officer training, Dr. Black
commented.
Prospective draftees were ad
vised to investigate fully voca
tional opportunities in the Army
and to select the : ob closest to
their aptitudes and interests: to
outline clearly their education
and experience, especially any of
it that relates to their choice; and,
finally, to express themselves ful
ly and forcefully to the classifica
tion interviewer at the reception
center.
Information about hundreds of
jobs in different branches of the
Army is available in the Vocational
Library at the Counseling and Test
ing Center, Dr. Black pointed out.
He also invited prospective draftees
interested in discovering their spe
cial aptitudes to utilize the services
of the Center.
