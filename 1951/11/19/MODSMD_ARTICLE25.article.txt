## Honor Code Considered By U. of Oregon Students 
### WALT MENNINGER 
The Associated Students of
i (he University of Oregon are
' considering the possibility of in
: itiating an honor system there,
: reports the Oregon Daily Emer- j
aid.
Alter a discission by the ASUO
Cabinet, the idea was tabled while a j
j committee was appointed to inves- !
] tigate the situation. During the j
heated discussion of the honor sys- !
| tem, certain cabinet members felt
i that "a different academic atmos
j phere (exists) at colleges where !
i such a system is used."
Said ASUO President Bill Carey, ,
"We shouldn't say this won't work |
until we try. Any step in the right
direction is worth while."

The vacation-loving Elis of Yale |
decided to "de-emphasize" their an- I
| nual big game with Harvard, in
j favor of the Dartmouth tilt. The
: reason for the change, explains the 1
Harvard Crimson, lies In the fact !
that this year the Eli Bulldog game
is scheduled after Thanksgiving.
The Yale students want to spend ;

I their vacations elsewhere than at
New Haven. Consequently, all the
j big parties and annual affairs, ordi
: narily saved for the Harvard game,
took place this last weekend.

At the University of Virginia, a
considerable furor has developed
over a new university ruling that
would put any student on proba
tion if he cuts anv class two days
before or after a vacation period.
The Cavalier Daily records stu
dent opinion as emphatically
against the administration. Said
one student, "I think it's a dirty
; trick on the people who have been
saving their cuts for Thanksgiv
ing." Adds another, "I believe
that the entire college should cut
classes before Thanksgiving holi
day."

While Stanford debates allowing
I a political group to be active on
! campus, the University of Washing
j ton is in hot water for going to the
■ extreme.
General Douglas Mac Arthur was
invited to give a speech on the Se
! attle campus, and last week he did
so with considerable vituperation of
I the Truman administration.
