# Nip S.F. State In Soccer, 1-0
## 
### 
Stanford's ever improving soccer
team vaulted into second place in
the Northern California Intercolle
giate Soccer Conference Saturday
by deefating San Francisco State 1
to 0.
ThÂ° Indians drove hard all
through the ball game but were un
able to put their lone score on the
board until midway in the final pe
riod.
Time and time again in the first
three periods the Indian forward
line, sparked by center forward JefT
Morshead, insides Rifka Aldikachti,
Sam Suarez, and Reuben Avesian,
wings Ar.dy Anderson, Bob Brig
ham and Ghulam Graus, moved the
ball into scoring position.
State tried desperately to even it
up, but the Indians' defense was up
to its task, and led by halfs Harry
Havilio and Derek Liechty and goal
Ben Swan presented the same stone
wall in the closing minutes that had
shut out the Gators all the wav.
