# Squad Keeps Cool, Confident; Coach Chuck Predicts 10th Win
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Only cheering, jubilant rooters and a serenading band rollicking outside the Stanford dressing
room gave a hint as to the importance of the Stanford win over Oregon State.
Inside, the players who had just cinched a Rose Bowl bid were going about their business of
showering, dressing, and meeting admirers. For the Stanford varsity the win against USC was the
one that gave them the Bowl bid. Saturday they had a job to do, and they did it. There was no

In the Beaver quarters, Kip Tay

"Well, we lost." He wouldn't com

"We did make some mistakes, but

I Kneve Bowl
However, Chuck Taylor seemed
lost in somewhat of a dream world, i
but when asked about the Rose '
Bowl he said, "No Rose Bowl talk
until after the Big Game. Besides. !
1 haven't had a chance to think ol |
its real meaning. Moreover, I am !
not in favor of post-season games, |
but I don't want to go into that
now."
As for the Oregon State game, !
Taylor expressed the view that the
Indians were not as high as per- i
haps they should hyve been, al- !
though he had told the squad all i
week that the Beavers would be
tough. A half-time talk helped fire
them up in the second half, Taylor
thought. "They realized that they
would have to get to work."
"Although it wasn't our best
game, we capitalized on the breaks j
and showed that we could run in i
spurts," Chuck said, adding, "We
were throwing too many long ones, I
trying for the quick scores."
The red-head did not believe that j
OSC was as good as he had expect- !
ed. "Their passing was not clicking, j
and they did get some bad breaks, j
They fooled us on their first touch- '
down. Bobby Thompson thought
they had reversed and came in to
stop the run. It was the first time
this year that we have allowed a
man to get behind-us like that."
In naming standouts. Chuck had ;
nothing but praise for Bob Meyers,
who is now back in shape, and said.
"Hugasian, who was kept out be- j
cause Meyers was doing so well, I
will have a fight for his job. The
prettiest block of the game was '

I • " '
thrown by Billy Heilbron on that I
run by Bob Garrett. Sam Morley
made some fine catches and Skip'
Crist made an interception in the 1
identical situation as against USC.
; Bill Storurn did some good block
ing. And Dick Horn was really
I heads up on defense."
The game was not without its \
cost. Jack Rye got a shoe in the J
ribs which might have penetrated
to his kidneys. He went to the hos
, pital for observation. He was joined
I by Ron Cook, who is under obser
vation for a bruised foot. Jack Bo
j netti received a nasty shoulder '
bump and will be X-rayed. Hart j
Cook got a head bruise from a mis- j
1 placed elbow. However, the head
mentor thought that all would be
1 in the best physical and mental
shape of the season for the Big
Game.
Cal Crucial
In reference to the Big One, Tay- !
lor said, "The Cal game will be j
tougher than the SC contest, just
because it is the Big Game. We
didn't use all we could have against
I the Beavers, but we will be shoot- ;

Only cheering, jubilant rooters and a serenading band rollicking outside the Stanford dressing

However, Chuck Taylor seemed
lost in somewhat of a dream world, i
but when asked about the Rose '
Bowl he said, "No Rose Bowl talk
until after the Big Game. Besides. !

its real meaning. Moreover, I am !
not in favor of post-season games, |
but I don't want to go into that
now."
As for the Oregon State game, !
Taylor expressed the view that the
Indians were not as high as per- i
haps they should hyve been, al- !
though he had told the squad all i
week that the Beavers would be
tough. A half-time talk helped fire
them up in the second half, Taylor
thought. "They realized that they
would have to get to work."
"Although it wasn't our best
game, we capitalized on the breaks j
and showed that we could run in i
spurts," Chuck said, adding, "We
were throwing too many long ones, I
trying for the quick scores."
The red-head did not believe that j
OSC was as good as he had expect- !
ed. "Their passing was not clicking, j
and they did get some bad breaks, j
They fooled us on their first touch- '
down. Bobby Thompson thought
they had reversed and came in to
stop the run. It was the first time
this year that we have allowed a
man to get behind-us like that."
In naming standouts. Chuck had ;
nothing but praise for Bob Meyers,
who is now back in shape, and said.
"Hugasian, who was kept out be- j
cause Meyers was doing so well, I
will have a fight for his job. The
prettiest block of the game was '

Only cheering, jubilant rooters and a serenading band rollicking outside the Stanford dressing
room gave a hint as to the importance of the Stanford win over Oregon State.
Inside, the players who had just cinched a Rose Bowl bid were going about their business of
showering, dressing, and meeting admirers. For the Stanford varsity the win against USC was the
one that gave them the Bowl bid. Saturday they had a job to do, and they did it. There was no

In the Beaver quarters, Kip Tay

"Well, we lost." He wouldn't com

I Kneve Bowl
However, Chuck Taylor seemed
lost in somewhat of a dream world, i
but when asked about the Rose '
Bowl he said, "No Rose Bowl talk
until after the Big Game. Besides. !
1 haven't had a chance to think ol |
its real meaning. Moreover, I am !
not in favor of post-season games, |
but I don't want to go into that
now."
As for the Oregon State game, !
Taylor expressed the view that the
Indians were not as high as per- i
haps they should hyve been, al- !
though he had told the squad all i
week that the Beavers would be
tough. A half-time talk helped fire
them up in the second half, Taylor
thought. "They realized that they
would have to get to work."
"Although it wasn't our best
game, we capitalized on the breaks j
and showed that we could run in i
spurts," Chuck said, adding, "We
were throwing too many long ones, I
trying for the quick scores."
The red-head did not believe that j
OSC was as good as he had expect- !
ed. "Their passing was not clicking, j
and they did get some bad breaks, j
They fooled us on their first touch- '
down. Bobby Thompson thought
they had reversed and came in to
stop the run. It was the first time
this year that we have allowed a
man to get behind-us like that."
