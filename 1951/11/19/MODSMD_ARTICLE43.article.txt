# Gaieties Axe Is Missing!
## 
### 
The axe has been stolen! Not the
Big Game axe that Cal has guarded
so jealously, but the axe that is to be
used in the finale of Gaieties. It dis
appeared last week, according to Dick
Bare, publicity chairman, and a fran
tic search has been going on ever
since.
There has been some suspicion
leveled at Cal students whoycame
down to view the SC football movies,

but the axe still hasn't turned up.
The axe is about 5 feet tall with a
I brown handle and red and white
j blade. Students are asked to be on
; the lookout for this vital prop, and
anyone finding it may claim a re
ward at the Ram's Head Office.
Tickets for all performances can
; still be bought at Memorial Audi
torium Box Office for 90 cents, $1.20,
and $1.50. The starting time of per
j formances this year is 9:15 p.m.
