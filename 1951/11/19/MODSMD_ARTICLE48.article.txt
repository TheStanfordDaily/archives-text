# Cardinals Plot Farm Activities
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Fall quarter at Stanford means
Big Game Week, spring quarter
means Back to the Farm Week
and the Con Home Drive. But
these activities don't just hap
pen.
Freshmen don't automatically
collect wood for the Big Game Bon
fire. Posters don't just naturally
sprout over night on bulletin boards
to advertise the Con Home Drive.
Someone has to do a lot of planning
and a lot of work before Stanford
activities can come off, and this
".someone" is Cardinals.
An administrative board under
ASSU Excom, Cardinals is in charge
of all-campus charitable and social
functions. Its 11 members are chair
men for most of the year's main
events.
A fairly typical Cardinal year is
1051, according to current President
Chuck Malouf. With fall quarter
not quite over, they have already
directed more than six activities.
Frosh Teachers
How did the class of '55 first lenrn
the scorc about Stanford? From the
Frosh "Bibie." And how did they
get the "Bible"? Thanks to Cardi
n ds. The activities group picked
the editor of the handbook and paid

for its publication out of its yearly
ASSU budget.
Pre-Reg was another Cardinal
responsibility. They worked hand
in hand with the chairman, named
by them.
Football season means football
movies, and these are put on under
Cardinal Skip Irving.
Floats rolled along the parade
route, entries were judged, and
prizes were awarded all according
to schedule on the UCLA weekend,
because of advance planning by a
committee under Cardinal Roy Al
exander.
Under Hospitality Chairman
Mary Strickland, housing was found
for the UCLA band, and the South
lander team welcomed at the air- i
port. Her committees have also met !
the footballers arriving for other
games.
Charity Drives
Money for the Palo Alio Com
munity Chest and the American
Cancer Society was collected last
month in the quarter's only char
ity drive, chairmanned by Elinor
Yancey. However, this will be the
last drive directly under Cardinals.
Instead, the newly formed Drives
Committee will take over.
When more than 400 California |
high school and junior college stu
dents were Stanford's guests last ]
Saturday at High School Day, the !
advance planning had been done
under .Tack Harper. Cardinals took
over the high school visitors last
year, when a formal day of tours
and talks was started by Ted Butt
ncr. Before that, small groups had i
come informally sponsored by Bay j

Area alumni.
And now it's Big Game time. Co
chairmen Jim Mansfield and De
light Kolar have estimated that
more than 100 committee members
are working directly under them—
and who knows how many more in
directly?
Cardinals has its fingers in some
other pies, too. Organizations want
ing to use the advertising banner
across from the Cellar have to sign
up with Secretary Diane Gordon,
for example. Rally Com is also a
Cardinal responsibility.
And this is only its fall-quarter
work. Campus tours will be con
ducted the rest of the year under
Delight Kolar. When a high school
calls up and wants to send a party
to see the University, Cardinals
takes over, Malouf explained.
Back to the Farm Week, the Con
Home Drive—these will keep Car
dinals busy spring quarter.
Funds for the whole program
come r*it of a $2,600 budget. Ap
proximately $1,400 of this goes for
the Frosh Handbook and the Pre-
Reti program, which leaves them
only $1,200 for the rest of the year's
work.
Cardinal Qualifications
And how do Cardinals get their
jobs? In spring quarter interviews,
junior and senior men and women
are picked on interest in school

spirit and traditions, originality of
ideas, and ability to conduct all
campus social and charitable affairs.
Next time you go to a rally, a
program, an all-campus event of
any kind, look on the sidelines for
the person making the machinery
work. He's apt to be a Cardinal.

Fall quarter at Stanford means
Big Game Week, spring quarter
means Back to the Farm Week
and the Con Home Drive. But
these activities don't just hap
pen.
Freshmen don't automatically
collect wood for the Big Game Bon
fire. Posters don't just naturally
sprout over night on bulletin boards
to advertise the Con Home Drive.
Someone has to do a lot of planning
and a lot of work before Stanford
activities can come off, and this
".someone" is Cardinals.
An administrative board under
ASSU Excom, Cardinals is in charge
of all-campus charitable and social
functions. Its 11 members are chair
men for most of the year's main
events.
A fairly typical Cardinal year is
1051, according to current President
Chuck Malouf. With fall quarter
not quite over, they have already
directed more than six activities.
Frosh Teachers
How did the class of '55 first lenrn
the scorc about Stanford? From the
Frosh "Bibie." And how did they
get the "Bible"? Thanks to Cardi
n ds. The activities group picked
the editor of the handbook and paid

for its publication out of its yearly
ASSU budget.
Pre-Reg was another Cardinal
responsibility. They worked hand
in hand with the chairman, named
by them.
Football season means football
movies, and these are put on under
Cardinal Skip Irving.
Floats rolled along the parade
route, entries were judged, and
prizes were awarded all according
to schedule on the UCLA weekend,
because of advance planning by a
committee under Cardinal Roy Al
exander.
Under Hospitality Chairman
Mary Strickland, housing was found
for the UCLA band, and the South
lander team welcomed at the air- i
port. Her committees have also met !
the footballers arriving for other
games.
Charity Drives
Money for the Palo Alio Com
munity Chest and the American
Cancer Society was collected last
month in the quarter's only char
ity drive, chairmanned by Elinor
Yancey. However, this will be the
last drive directly under Cardinals.
Instead, the newly formed Drives
Committee will take over.
