PARIS, Nov. IS — The United
Slates, Britain ,and France put be
fore the United Nations General
Assembly today a formal resolution
providing for the formation within
30 days of a UN disarmament com
mission to work on draft treaties
for halting the world arms race.
A world disarmament conference
"of all states" would be called to
ratify any agreement as soon as the
commission had made sufficient
progress.
The proposal is weakened, how
ever, by the fact that the commis
sion's work would be subject at all
times to the big-power veto—-mak
ing it unlikely that any substantial
agreement ever will be reached.
