"Stanford is a friendly college."
This was the general opinion of 400
high school students who were the
guests of the University Saturday
for the annual High School Day.
Students from 59 high schools
heard speeches by academic and
campus leaders at the opening
morning assembly in Memorial Au
ditorium. This was emceed by
Chuck Malouf, president of Cardi
nals, co-sponsor of High School Day.
After the assembly, the students
who came north from the Los An
geles area and from schools around
the Bay, were conducted on tours
of the campus. Thirty-five student
guides showed the prospective
Stanfordites Hoover Tower, Memo
rial Church, and other Stanford
"spots." Then they were taken to
departments of their interest where
descriptions of the departments
were given.
At noon the visitors ate lunch at
dorms and fraternities. The Oregon
State game climaxed the day's ac
tivities.
Jack Harper, High School Day
chairman, expressed satisfaction
over the attendance and co-opera
tion for the day. He was assisted
by Margot Fish, publicity; Maxine
Pierce, guides; Grant Spaeth, de
partment tours; Anne Horncy, reg
