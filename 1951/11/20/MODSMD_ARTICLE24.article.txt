# Freshman Aid Badly Needed For Bonfire
## 
### 
Bonfire construction, scheduled to
get under way yesterday at Lake
Lag, crawled along as four men,
none of them frosh, provided the
only labor. In view of the tight
schedule planned for the building
of the fire, a desperate plea for help
has been issued by Jack Blumberg,
head Encina sponsor, who is in
charge of co-ordinating the fresh-
Freshmen are urged to get out
and help, as work commencing at
noon today will carry right through,
day and night, until the massive
structure is ignited Thursday night.
The wood scattered about the lake
bed, only slightly dampened by yes
terday's downpour,, is still in good
burning condition.
The IX 45-foot telephone poles
which form the supporting frame
work for .the fire were set in the
ground last week by 20 volunteer
Pacific Gas and Electric Company
workmen from Redwood City. The
poles are set in the form of an equi
lateral triangle.
The planned appearance of Roble
and Branner girls to serve water,
lemonade, and coffee to the fam
ished workers today should provide
added impetus to prospective fire
builders. This project is being fi
nanced through Roble and Branner
funds.
Meanwhile, guarding of the cam
pus is proceeding as planned, with
the numerous roadblocks being
manned by each froSh dorm wing
for a three-hour shift.
