# Students Gripe About Rose Bowl Tickets
## 
### 
Announcement of tentative plans for Rose
Bowl ticket sales has caused a minor furor on
campus. Several students have objected to
the proposed "buy at Stanford, pick up at Pasa
dena" plan for rooters' tickets. Their legitimate
gripe is the inconvenience of standing in line
twice, once here, once at the stadium in Pasa
dena, to pick up but one ticket.
The object of the deferred ticket delivery is
to stop scalping, a commendable idea. Several
schools have used the proposed plan in hand
ling Rose Bowl sales, including Michigan last
year. The plan has worked well, according to
the Stanford Athletic Office.
We agree with Athletic Director A 1 Masters
who doesn't want to see gray haired old men
sitting in the rooter's section. But the idea of
hunting for the stadium in Pasadena just to pick
up the ticket doesn't sound too good either.
Perhaps student suggestions will provide an
answer. One suggestion we heard today was
this: place'booths in several convenient Los
Angeles locations, so that students won't have
to traipse out to Pasadena to stand in line. This
means more work for the Athletic department,
of course, but with help from such organiza
tions as the Public Relations Committee at Stan
ford it might prove practical.
There may be better ideas. The Stanford
Athletic department has decided nothing yet,

and will be glad to listen to constructive ideas
received by them, The Daily or anyone else.
Of course there is a sad irony to the whole
problem of scalping. Maybe the student will
be stopped by the deferred plan, but not the
alumni. And not the students who are flock
ing to join the Alumni Association in order to
become eligible for the four tickets that can
be purchased by members.
The Alumni membership campaign which
got underway last week with letters to every
student non-member, has put Alumni Director
Jack Shoup and his office in a peculiar position,
incidentally. The drive was scheduled for this
time months ago. The campaign would have
been held regardless of the way the football
bounced this fall. That a football labeled "Rose
Bowl" bounced Stanford's way has caused the
Alumni drive to look malicious to some per
sons. To them, instead of just an appeal to
join the association, the campaign looks like
a bribe for students to join now and receive a
chance for extra Rose Bowl tickets.
There is no connection between the timing
of the drive and the Rose Bowl ticket appli
cations. It just happened that way. A big in
crease in student membership has resulted.
We're glad to see that steps are being taken
to stop scalping, but sorry that they will be
effective only in controlling students, and not
alumni. Anybody have any ideas on this one?
