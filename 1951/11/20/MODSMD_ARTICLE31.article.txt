### PETE GROTHE 
irS HERE . . . BIC, GAME WEEK
If I were a Hollywood movie publicist, I'd describe
the Big Game and Big Game Week as "colossal, pro
digious, an epic, the befit in history." But I am not a
citicma publicist (heaven forbid), and I don't have to
throw all those high-powered but empty adjectives

at you.
All I have to say is that it's
Big Game Week. That's enough.
Big Game Week is Big Game
Week, and that's all one has to
say.
Think of all the preparation that
goes on for the 60 football minutes
that will be played this Saturday.
Right now as you read this,
alums everywhere, from New
York, Dallas, Texas, to Lost Rock,
lowa are making or confirming

reservations for transportation to the Farm.
Radio and television stations and the newsreels are
making arrangements to bring this game to millions
of people who won't be present at Stanford's Big
Brown Bowl.
Gaieties Director Hal Burdick. drama-wise and
personable, is making last-minute switches and
plans for his show that opens tonight. The Gaieties
this year are tops, and 80 odd performers have toiled
weeks to add their hit to Big Game Week.
Parenthetically, I must mention something that will
add to your enjoyment of the Gaieties. TTie Space
Patrol skit, in which I play a part that is not monu
mental, has a rather unique sound effect. Near the
end, the audience hears three rocket ships zooming
off into space, one by one. The sound effects depart
ment was rather hard set to get. three rocket ships,
so they did the next best thing. At the proper cue.
a girl off-stage on a microphone orders a boy in the
men's john to "fire away." With which he flushes
the toilet that is right next to a microphone. This
gives the effect of a rocket ripping off into space.

And so when you hear, '"There goes Astro ofT to
Mars," etc., you'll know that Astro is not oil' in the
stratosphere at all but really flushing the toilet in the
men's john.
But back to our point. Other people are preparing
for this game in varied and multifarious ways. The
men who run the concessions at the Stadium are
ordering so many thousand cokes, hot dogs, gremlins,
etc.
Jim Mansfield and Delight Kolar, chairmen of the
Big Game Committee, are forgetting their studies and
working 12 hours a day on preparations. The same
goes for Bill Otterson and other members of Rally Com.
The Stanford hand is also getting ready for the Big
Game. Julius Shuchat and his musicians are spend
ing countless hours perfecting patterns for a short
stunt on the field this Saturday.
The students are preparing also. A boy steps out
of a phone booth and announces to an eagerly-await
ing group of boys that he failed or succeeded to get
that Big Game date. Dateless girls, on the other hand,
are racing to ringing phones to find out whether they
are going to curl up with a good book on Big Game
night 'or not.
The freshmen are working the hardest of all the
students. The woodpile is mounting and frosh
guards patrol the campus in the wee hours of the
morning to see that no one prevents that wood pile
from continuing to mount.
The most tireless toilers, of course, are the main
performers themselves, the coaches and the players.
Pappy and Chuck and their respective staffs are work
ing from eight in the morning until one at night—
watching game movies, diagramming plays, detecting
enemy weaknesses, drilling players, and wiping pers
piration from their brows. The players themselves
are doing deep knee bends, push-ups, windsprints,
blocking, tackling, running through plays, passing,
catching, punting, centering, and everything else that
will make them razor sharp for the game.
Yes, this is Big Game Week. And without a doubt,
it's the high spot of our collegiate year.

Right now as you read this,
alums everywhere, from New
York, Dallas, Texas, to Lost Rock,
lowa are making or confirming

reservations for transportation to the Farm.
Radio and television stations and the newsreels are
making arrangements to bring this game to millions
of people who won't be present at Stanford's Big
Brown Bowl.
Gaieties Director Hal Burdick. drama-wise and
personable, is making last-minute switches and
plans for his show that opens tonight. The Gaieties
this year are tops, and 80 odd performers have toiled
weeks to add their hit to Big Game Week.
Parenthetically, I must mention something that will
add to your enjoyment of the Gaieties. TTie Space
Patrol skit, in which I play a part that is not monu
mental, has a rather unique sound effect. Near the
end, the audience hears three rocket ships zooming
off into space, one by one. The sound effects depart
ment was rather hard set to get. three rocket ships,
so they did the next best thing. At the proper cue.
a girl off-stage on a microphone orders a boy in the
men's john to "fire away." With which he flushes
the toilet that is right next to a microphone. This
gives the effect of a rocket ripping off into space.

And so when you hear, '"There goes Astro ofT to
Mars," etc., you'll know that Astro is not oil' in the
stratosphere at all but really flushing the toilet in the
men's john.
But back to our point. Other people are preparing
for this game in varied and multifarious ways. The
men who run the concessions at the Stadium are
ordering so many thousand cokes, hot dogs, gremlins,
etc.
Jim Mansfield and Delight Kolar, chairmen of the
Big Game Committee, are forgetting their studies and
working 12 hours a day on preparations. The same
goes for Bill Otterson and other members of Rally Com.
The Stanford hand is also getting ready for the Big
Game. Julius Shuchat and his musicians are spend
ing countless hours perfecting patterns for a short
stunt on the field this Saturday.
The students are preparing also. A boy steps out
of a phone booth and announces to an eagerly-await
ing group of boys that he failed or succeeded to get
that Big Game date. Dateless girls, on the other hand,
are racing to ringing phones to find out whether they
are going to curl up with a good book on Big Game
night 'or not.
The freshmen are working the hardest of all the
students. The woodpile is mounting and frosh
guards patrol the campus in the wee hours of the
morning to see that no one prevents that wood pile
from continuing to mount.
The most tireless toilers, of course, are the main
performers themselves, the coaches and the players.
Pappy and Chuck and their respective staffs are work
ing from eight in the morning until one at night—
watching game movies, diagramming plays, detecting
enemy weaknesses, drilling players, and wiping pers
piration from their brows. The players themselves
are doing deep knee bends, push-ups, windsprints,
blocking, tackling, running through plays, passing,
catching, punting, centering, and everything else that
will make them razor sharp for the game.
Yes, this is Big Game Week. And without a doubt,
it's the high spot of our collegiate year.

If I were a Hollywood movie publicist, I'd describe
the Big Game and Big Game Week as "colossal, pro
digious, an epic, the befit in history." But I am not a
citicma publicist (heaven forbid), and I don't have to
throw all those high-powered but empty adjectives

at you.
All I have to say is that it's
Big Game Week. That's enough.
Big Game Week is Big Game
Week, and that's all one has to
say.
Think of all the preparation that
goes on for the 60 football minutes
that will be played this Saturday.
