# Nielsen Continues Impressions

(The following is the second and last installment
of Phil Nielsen's letter, describing his impressions
of life at the Free University of Berlin, where he is
on an ASSU exchange scholarship.)
By PHIL NIELSEN
Turning to the University itself, it is an assortment
of buildings located mainly in Dahlem, with some
scattered in other parts of Berlin. The style of archi
tecture as well as the physical condition of the build
ings varies considerably. There is always the prob
lem of too little space and facilities for the students,
and in this respect the University and students are,
believe me, hard pressed.
Students on the average are much older here: 80
per cent are between 20 and 30 years of age. And the
whole tone of activities of the University is more ser
ious. more mature. For example, the average of the
leaders of the so-called Allgemeiner Studentenauss
chuss (the Student Government) is around 2G or 27.
Striking, t<M», is the pathetic poverty among the
students. Over half of them exist on scholarships
given by the City of Berlin in the amount of l)M SO.
per month, (about $20). a tragically paltry sum.
which must pay all costs, including tuition, meals,
room, books, transportation, and clothing, etc.
I will probably never understand how these stu
dents manage to live on this. I do not think many
Americans could so exist; and I know I would find it
impossible. And it is practically impossible for stu
dents to find part time employment to supplement
their scholarship money because jobs are extremely
scarce.
To help cut living expenses, each student receives
free every day one or two large bowls of a substantial
soup. Many students have only this to count on for
nourishment.
Nearly .15 per cent of the Free University students
are refugees from the Russian Zone and naturally
could bring very little with them in the way of
possessions. Many of these particular students live
in anxiety for the safety of their parents --till living
in the East. One ran do no more than admire the
quiet courage and perseverence of these long-op
pressed students who at least have opportunity to
study—stark through the conditions may be—under
freedom and without political indoctrination.
The name and reputation of Stanford among the
students with whom I have come into contact is held
in high esteem. There is a strong feeling of gratitude
for the indispensably fine help rendered by Stanford

and the Associated Students to the Free University.
I can assure you that it will never be forgotten. Dr.
Fritz T. Epstein, of our Hoover Library, who taught
here a year ago, and his wife are much beloved by
the students.
I have found that the most difficult and at the same
time the most challenging task which I face here
as an American student is the job of defining and
explaining Democracy to Germans.
One must readjust one's thinking about Democracy
and try to clarfiy its spirit and substance so that it
makes sense to people who are somewhat suspicious
of it, who have had little recent experience with it
and who live and have been brought up in a totally
different environment from America. One mir t ex
amine carefully the tenets and experiences of the
American form of Democracy and rtiake certain that
these have possibilities of application and usefulness
in the German milieu.
But because of the previous training of German
youth under National Socialism, and because of the
poverty and highly disturbed conditions existing at
present in Germany, anil because of the menace
which the Soviets present to security, it is hard for
one to make significant or noticeable headway in
this mission. It is not an ideal climate for the germi
nation of practice of a new form of behavior.
But I would say to you that today there is no more
valuable work that you might undertake and promote
than the education on the Stanford campus of our
foreign students in the spirit of the American System
of Democracy.
You might spend a little time devising the best
methods by which this objective might bo realized
in an accelerated and express fashion for foreigners.
Under the ASSU Foreign Scholarship Progiam we
have attempted several measures, such as seminars,
field trips to government and business enterprises,
radio and TV speeches and talks by the scholars in
schools and to church and other local organizations.
These arc steps in the fight direction: but all of
our foreigners should see us at work with the Demo
cratic process: how decisions are made in student
groups—what role group discussions plav antl how
teamwork enters in—what values are important on
the part of student leaders in making decisions—
what sorts of persons are chosen as leaders—the
value of committee work and reports, etc. The pos
sibilities are myriad, and you are in a unique po
sition to stimulate improvements in this Held.
