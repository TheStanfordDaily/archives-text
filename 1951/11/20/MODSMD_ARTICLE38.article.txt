Humor magazines may die. but
they never fade away.
USC lost its controversial Wam
pus this year because of various
difficulties, but already plans are
being laid by the Greater Univer
sity sub - committee at Southern
California concerning a new humor
mag.
Currently taking a poll to deter
mine the type of a future maga
zine, the Greater University com
mittee has been analyzing the good
and bad points of a humor maga
zine for several weeks.
In its analysis it has discovered
that the Wampus failed not because
of lack of student support, but rath
er for several reasons, among them:
Political appointment control.
A salary system which made put
ting out an indifferent magazine
profitable to the staff.
Use of the magazine as a weapon
of personal, political, and social be
liefs.
Failure to encourage student tal
ent in the preparation of the book.
Repeated use of the same engrav
ings for the past four years and to
tal lack of originality.
