# Italian Floods Rage
## 
### 
ROME—Pelting rains today sent
new torrents roaring down on half- j
deserted cities in the Hood-ravaged :
lower Po River Valley.
American Air Force planes and |
helicopters, British and Italian air
craft dropped food to flood-trapped |
residents of Adria and Rolzxo —
hardest hit of the Hood-stricken j
cities. Other planes and surface |
craft took the ill and disabled from
the flood area.
Official Italian sources said ap
proximately 100 persons have died
in the floods and more than 100,000
have been made homeless.
