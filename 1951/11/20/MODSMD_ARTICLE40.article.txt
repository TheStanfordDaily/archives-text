are anxious to exchange letters
with American students on subjects
ranging from hobbies to specialized
academic iielas.
Anyone who wants a chance to
practice a foreign language, estab- '
lish contacts abroad, or to exchange
ideas with students in other coun
tries can obtain information from j
Art Breisky, UN Education Center
desk in the lIR. shack, between 5

of the students on the list can write
English.
