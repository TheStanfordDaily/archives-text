# Cal Coaches Cry and Cry But Don't You Believe It

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20 (UP)—California coaches, used to
winning teams for the past four years, got out the crying towels
today and moaned so loud that sports writers suggested they
cancel their annual "Big Game" with undefeated Stanford on
Saturday.
"Oh, we'll show up," said End Coach Eggs Manske of Cal, "but
I'm telling you it will be useless.

They'll beat us by from three to five i
touchdowns—it will be murder. j
"They have the greatest end in
collegiate football in Hill McColl:
and not only that, he is the best
end in professional football. If be
decides to play professional foot
ball, he will be all-pro, all-time
end his first year in the league."
Drawing a deep breath, Manske
went on:
' Want to hear more?
"Well, their quarterback, Gary i
Kerkorian, is the best passer in the i
West and probably in the nation; j
compared with him, our Billy Mais ;
is a child.
"I would trade all our four de- J
tensive ends for Chuck Taylor's two !
top men; Mary Hugasian and Bob j
Meyers are better halfbacks than j
any we have; and Hon Cook is just
as good.
"At fullback, last week Hob
Mathias was the best fullback I
ever saw in college football; he '
is twice as good as anything we j
have at present unless Johnny ()l- j
szewski should turn up in sound
condition."
Head Coach Lynn (Pappy) Wal
dorf joined in the sound and fury,
too.
"I would say that the Pacific

Coust Conference is stronger than
nt any time in the past 10 years,"
said Waldorf. Stanford went
through the league undefeated.
"Stanford has a better club than
any we have met in the past five
years, with the possible exception
of Ohio State. Stanford has a very
sound football team on which it is
hard to find a weakness.
"In fact, one of their strongest
points is in passing — and we are
weakest on pass defense."
Getting back to Manske:
' This is the first Stanford team
in my five years at California that
really knew how to block. And
when they tackle it isn't one man
biding the ball carrier — usually
five or six.
"Their Dick Horn is the best
safety man in the West and prob
ably in the country.
"The only possible way- we could
win would be to improve 100 per
cent. Then we would have to catch
them 'flat' while we are at the peak
of our game."
Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford
listened to Manske and then turned
to Waldorf and asked one question:
"Could I borrow Manske to come
down to Stanford Thursday to speak
at the pep rally?"


TROUBLE AHEAD—Stanford backs are likely to get the same
treatment Saturday as is being given Oregon back Tom Novi
koff by two Californians, John Peterson (bottom) and Pete Mer
ing (rear). The Indians, who rely mostly on their passing, must
be able to run through this Bear defense or their passing will in
turn be less effective.—Acme Telephoto

Drawing a deep breath, Manske
went on:

ever saw in college football; he '

Head Coach Lynn (Pappy) Wal

"I would say that the Pacific

Coust Conference is stronger than

said Waldorf. Stanford went
through the league undefeated.
"Stanford has a better club than
any we have met in the past five
years, with the possible exception
of Ohio State. Stanford has a very
sound football team on which it is
hard to find a weakness.
"In fact, one of their strongest
points is in passing — and we are
weakest on pass defense."
Getting back to Manske:
' This is the first Stanford team
in my five years at California that
really knew how to block. And
when they tackle it isn't one man
biding the ball carrier — usually
five or six.
"Their Dick Horn is the best
safety man in the West and prob
ably in the country.
"The only possible way- we could
win would be to improve 100 per
cent. Then we would have to catch
them 'flat' while we are at the peak
of our game."
Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford
listened to Manske and then turned
to Waldorf and asked one question:
"Could I borrow Manske to come
down to Stanford Thursday to speak
at the pep rally?"


TROUBLE AHEAD—Stanford backs are likely to get the same
treatment Saturday as is being given Oregon back Tom Novi
koff by two Californians, John Peterson (bottom) and Pete Mer
ing (rear). The Indians, who rely mostly on their passing, must
be able to run through this Bear defense or their passing will in
turn be less effective.—Acme Telephoto
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20 (UP)—California coaches, used to
winning teams for the past four years, got out the crying towels
today and moaned so loud that sports writers suggested they
cancel their annual "Big Game" with undefeated Stanford on
Saturday.
"Oh, we'll show up," said End Coach Eggs Manske of Cal, "but
I'm telling you it will be useless.

They'll beat us by from three to five i
touchdowns—it will be murder. j
