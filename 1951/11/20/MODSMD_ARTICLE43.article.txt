## Punts and Pitches

Unless you've just dropped down from Mars, you know that this Satur
day is the Big Game.
Reams and reams have been written and will be written about the Cal
game coming, up. but as yet no one has mentioned the complete reversal
of the positions of the teams since the season began. We think it is worthy
of mention, because it's very rare that the stature of two teams can change
so radically during the stretch of a season.
And so let's turn back the clock.
Remember when students were returning to the Farm in early Autumn
with either a Balhoa tan or a look of European worldliness? At that time,
Cal was rated one of the three best teams in the nation. Stanford? If you
looked down in the fine print, you found it ranked thirty-fifth. Nothing
happened to change those rankings in the first three weeks. The Indians j
fell into two victories over weak Oregon and weaker San Jose State.
In the meantime, Pappy Waldorf's crew was splattering the remains of
Santa Clara, Pennsylvania, and Michigan all over the turf, and Cal jumped
to first in the nation in everyone's book. Look. Ma, no hands. It was the rule
rather than the exception for sports scribes to describe this as the greatest
Cal team ever. The writers explained how the first seven left guards could
be injured and the eighth string left guard could step in without any loss
of efficiency.
Stanford? Oh, it climbed to about twenty-seventh for the simple reason
that some of the 34 teams who were ranked above it had lost games, and
the Indian's team had just beat one of the weakest Michigan teams in years.
That was all several weeks ago. In the meantime, a beautiful bubble
had been burst. Pappy was right all the time. Cal really never was that
good, and right now they stand about twentieth in the nation.
The Stanford team that at the commencement of the season was ranked |
from fourth to six in the PCC and which UP sports editor Hal Wood termed
a "probable weakling" is now among the top three in the U.S. The Indians '
beat everyone they locked horns with, including some of the best outfits j
in the country, by means of great come-through performances.
Chuck Taylor's underlings now face their toughest game of the year.
Not because Cal is better than USC, UCLA, or even Michigan, but for
the reason that this is the Big Game. And as the old cliche goes, anything
can happen in the Big Game, despite the odds.
We are of the opinion that Stanford will play its best game of the year
and win, 28 to 14. Dink Templeton, who's seen every Stanford team worth
seeing, made a rather startling statement last Saturday, "This is probably
the greatest Stanford team of all time."
Okay, McColl. Kerkorian, Mathias, Meyers, and company, take it away! !

FLAHERTY REPENTS. We talked with a Los Angeles reporter last j
Saturday at the game and asked him whether Vincent X. Flaherty was j
around. We wanted to have a word with him on his. theory that "Southern
California athletes should stay at home." The reporter replied no. Flaherty j
wasn't around and that he was sorry that he ever wrote what he did. It j
seems that the article that we reprinted in Bull Session drew quite a bit
of criticism and Flaherty bemoans the fact he ever opened his trap.
SOUTHWOOD SITS STUDYING WHILE STANFORD SCINTILLATES
DEPT. We finally found one ... a Stanford student who wasn't (1) at
the Southern Cal game, or (2) listening to it. No, it wasn't a grad student ,
who was too wrapped up in law studies or an exchange student from Pakis- j
tan who didn't know anything about football. It was none less than Eric
Southwood, injured halfback, now recovered.
Southwood. a straight "A" nied school student, was in the libe tending j
to his med school studies. Explains Eric, "I couldn't have taken the
emotional strain."

GOING UP'.' Chuck Taylor might wish that his football players were ■
a little heavier, but as far as the manager of the President Hotel in Palo
Alto is concerned, they are heavy enough. Several of the players got into
the elevator that had a one ton limit and pressed the button for an above
floor. Result: the weightecl-down elevator fell right to the basement.

We leave you with this thought: BEAT CAL.
