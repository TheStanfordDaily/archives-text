# Cards Prep for Big One; Cook May Be Sidelined
## 
### 
The Big Red Machine set itself for
the Big Push yesterday, as they ran
through a short drill session on the

frosh practice field, the varsity field j
being rain-sodden.
From a physical standpoint, the I
Indians came out of last Saturday's
tussle in pretty good shape. There '
were a few minor injuries but, with
the possible exception of halfback
Ron Cook, everyone will be ready j
for California. Cook, who cracked ;
a foot bone in the Washington game, [
had the same foot stepped on last j
weekend and will probably see lit- :
tie if any action.
Other injuries included a bruised

back for Jack Rye, a bruised leg for
j Jim Vick, pulled shoulder muscle j
for Jack Bonetti, a minor hip point
er for Bob Mathias, and a couple
of broken ribs on Don Tobin. A few
pads placed here and there and all
will be ready and r'arin' come Sat- !
I urday.
Yesterday the victorious. Cards—
evidently keeping in mind the Stan
ford Big Game famine—ran through
their drills with gusto. Chuck Tay
lor stressed perfection of timing and
blocking in existing plays, being of
the opinion that it's too late in the
game to make any drastic changes
in the plays. Taylor al.so opined

that if the Cards play their best
game this Saturday, they'll win—
leaving it now up to the boys them
selves.
The Indian defensive unit, mean
j while, undertook to change their
| defensive setup to handle a T-for-
I mation offense, which the Bears use.
| Not since the Washington game
; have the Cards faced a straight T.
Taylor has expressed himself as fa
| voring defending against the single
j wing, but since Pappy Waldorf
probably won't oblige, Stanford will
face a T-formation team like them
selves this weekend.
