## 
### 
Dressed in beaded leather and full feathered headdress, Prince
Lightfoot of the Yurok Indian tribe will do his Hunt-the-Bear and
Victory dances at the Indian Hunting Ceremony Friday at 7:30 in
Frost Amphitheater.
"Chief Winbiggame," a les3 authentic Indian of the Stanford

tribe, will also appear, along with
Head Yell Leader "Tom-Tom" Ran
dolph. Ram's Head members will
direct and appear in "Oedipus
Bear," a one-act, play about an In
dian maiden, endangered by a "fe- ;'
rocious bear loose in the environs
of Palo Alto."
All alumni here for homecoming
are especially invited to join stu- j
dents at the ceremony, according to j
co-chairmen Pete Hadden and Syd
ney Walton.
The story behind Prince I.ight
foot's appearance began last
month when he wrote ASSU
President Wayne Alley that as a
loivj-time Stanford fan, he want
ed very much to sec the Big
Game and would be willing to do
an Indian dance at the prc-gamc
festivities.
The prince, whose everyday name j
is Timm Williams and whose ad
dress is Kentfield, Calif., i; eligible!
to become a chief in the California ;
Yurok tribal organization. The or
ganization, which centers in Del j
Norte County, has more than 33,000
members.
Twenty-seven years old, .slim and j
good-looking, the prince was born j
in Klamath, Calif. Alter a year at
Cal, he attended the University of
San Francisco. Now he is a super
visor for Luckenbach Steamship
I Company in the City.
"Good sportsmanship" won his
j admiration for Stanford, Prince
1 Lightfoot explained. He particular
ly likes the spirit in the Farm root- j
j ing sections.
For the past several years,
Prince Lightfoot has gone through
the Indian ritual necessary to
bring Stanford good luck. "In our
j tribe, whenever anyone wants
' something to happen, he goes out
at midnight for ten days to a
lonely place and prays," he ex
plained. "So for ten night . I'll
j be busy,' he» added, smiling. "I
hope it will work."
Prince Lightfoot himself made the
costume he will wear Friday night.
He even trapped the mink and er
mine tails which ring the leather
costume. Each design on the cos
tume has a symbol'c meaning.
Double arrows mean good luck, and
broken arrows pe;ice, for example.
The Hunt-the-Bear dance, which
j will open the ceremony, tells a story
j in pantomime. Starting in a sitting
j position, the dancer stalks the bear,
kills it, and celebrates his victory,
j A chant accompanies the dance.
The story of the prince's fam-
I ily is like a chapter of California
I history. When white soldiers first
came (o the Yurok country, his
great - grandfather killed six of
j them with a how and arrow. 11 is
! grandfather was only l*i when
! white settlers came. They be
friended hint and he became their
| guide.
The tribal organization to which
: the prinee belongs includes several
j other peoples who have banded to- i
, getber with the Yuroks. The or
| ganization meets regularly and
j holds ceremonials, which only re- j
cently have been open to the public.
In fact, the two dances Prince ]
Lightfoot will do in Frost Amphi- i
theater should be no chore. At a
ceremonial in Klanfith a few years
ago he danced steadily from 10 one
night until 10 the next morning.

Prince Lightfoot himself made the

mine tails which ring the leather
costume. Each design on the cos
tume has a symbol'c meaning.
Double arrows mean good luck, and
broken arrows pe;ice, for example.

j in pantomime. Starting in a sitting
j position, the dancer stalks the bear,
kills it, and celebrates his victory,
j A chant accompanies the dance.
The story of the prince's fam-
I ily is like a chapter of California

came (o the Yurok country, his
great - grandfather killed six of
j them with a how and arrow. 11 is
! grandfather was only l*i when
