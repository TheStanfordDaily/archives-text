# CARDS GO FOR AXE AFTER LONG FAMINE
## Indians Seek Tenth Scalp 
### EARL ODELL Sports Editor, Stanford Daily 
Forget the Rose Bowl! Forget the PCC championship! Forge*
studies! This is the Big Game! This is what Chuck Taylor and his
J boys have been, looking forward to for a long time.
When it comes to Big Games there's been a famine on the Farm
for four years, and the Stanford varsity would Like to end it right
now. For four years Stanford has walked into the big Game as
lowly underdogs and played their greatest game of the year only
to walk out of the stadium without a victory.
This year, glory bo. the Indians will go into the game favored to bring
home the axr. This the present band of Indians aren't used to, but they
aren't hothered by odds, knowing that they never comr out right in the
] Big Game anyhow.
California, on the other hand, finds itself in the position of lowly ones;
and, aware of what Stanford has done the past three years in that spot,
is making the most of it. In faet, California has spent the latter part of the
| season in an attempt to set up the greatest psychological defeat in history,
i Stanford, with Chuck Taylor and his peerless predictions, is not used to
; the old crying towel and is more apt to fall for a tear than anyone else,
i and the Bears realize that. Because of that. Pappy Waldorf has had his
| end coach and head scout, "Egg.." Manske, hard at work inflating the
j Cards' ego.
.Manske Predicts R'»ut
\ Man.ske wa.<; a master after the USC game when he '-aid in effect:
"Stanford is a wonderful team. Kerkorian is a wonderful, passer. MeColl
j is a wonderful receiver. Wonderful players man every position.
: "It really isn't fair that we should have to meet such a wonderful bunch
It will be murder. Pitifully few and crippled as we are, we won't stand *
j chance.
"The humane authorities ought to step in and rail the whole thing off."
Monday, after Stanford's ninth win. Manske at the spnrtswriter's luneh
j eon in San Francisco broke out the crocodiles again. In fact he did such
, a good job that Waldorf had to assure everyone that Cal would show up
i for the game.
Now. if this isn't a perfect piece of psychological waifare, we should have
flunked Psych 51.
In short, Manske. Pappy, his boys, and the whole Crfl campus would be
[ deleriously happy if the Indians were to believe Manske's gushings. And
if they do, they'll never get their helmets on and Cal will walk ai! over them.
Not only could this take efTect on Stanford, but it has taken effect on
the Bears. It's got them roaring mad. They would rather knock off Stanford
—particularly in the undefeated condition in which they now repose—than
eat dinner. And you can forget this stuff about Cal not having the team to
do it. They've got more than enough.
Cal Conference Hushing Champion
As the records now stand, California leads the Conference in rushing
with a neat .1081 yards in nine games for a 304.2 average. Stanford sits in
fourth place with 2114 and a 199.8 average. In total offense California still
j leads with 3624 yards and 402.7 average, while Stanford has gained 3227 tor
a 358.5 average. This gives the Boars a nice edge.
Now consider the fact that California undoubtedly will play their be:!.
| game of the season and remember that earlier this year they were the num
I her one team in the nation. Don't try to repress the fact that in their first
three games they beat Santa Clara 34 to 0, Pennsylvania 35 to 0, and Minn
: esota 55 to 14. They were great then, and they're going to play their be. t.
game this Saturday.
j California has caught the dreaded Indian disease this year—injuriti;.
This disease, which has hung around the Farm for the past few years, has
been cured in the Stanford training quarters for the most part, but it ha,
j spread to the Berkeley campus. At the same time the Cards have conic up
I with something the Bears were thought to monopolize.
In the past when a Bear was injured. Pappy would come up with someone
who would play a better game than the injured man ever could. Thi ; season
Stanford has developed that "disease." When Jesse Cone, the Indians' All -
j Coast nominee for defensive guard honors, was injured in the Santa Clara
; game, Taylor came up with Hart Cook, a little heard of but tremendous
j lineman who has since done a terrific job of filling in.
Last week with Harry Hugasian on the mend with a broken toe. Bob
Meyers filled in and played the outstanding game of the day.
However, don't let all of this sway you. The Bears, unlike what Man
| would have you believe, are not walking around on crutches. True, they
; have injury problems, but nothing so that they won't get out there Saturday
and score a few times Cal's biggest injury has been Johnny Olszewski';
j knee, injured in the USC game and re injured against Washington. Pappy' ;
i not talking, but you can lay a sizeable bet that. Johnny O will ramble
this weekend, and he's dangerous in any league.
Bears Have All-American, Too
Speaking of danger, the Bears have an Ail-American named l«es Richfer.
| He's a linebacker, and you'll see a lot of him Saturday. In last year's Big
Game it was Richter who intercepted a pass to break tip a Stanford threat,
for the winning touchdown. On a given Saturday—and you can call th
Saturday that given one—Pichter could make USC's Pat Cannamela lool
like a toy. and if you'll remember, Cannamela was no easy man to handle
And that's not all Cal has. In their baekfield they have Billy Mai at,
quarter. Mais is a good faker and. though not the passer that Kerkorian ]-.
: is a dangerous man in the air when the occasion calls for it. You'll ;lso
see a lot of Don Johnson, Don Harris, and Harry West.
As for the offensive line, Cal has one of the best in the Conference They
1 don't handle easily, particularly Bob Karpe, Ralph Krucger, and Ozzie
j Harris.
The Bear defense is reputed to be weak. Don't believe it. At the be
ginning of the season they were unseored upon until third third game, , nr?
; remember they'll play their best game Saturday. You'll see c lot of tackles
by defensive ha Ifs Dick LemMon and Sain Williams,, if his injury permits,
| and if the Card backs get beyond \he line of scrimmage.
On the Stanford side of the picture things look blight. With the excep
! tion of halfback Hon Cook, the Indians will be at full strength for the bu
, one. Some of the boys will see only a little action because of previous in
i juries, but they'll be backed up well.
General Gary Kerkorian, who last year had his best day in the Big Gain. l
completing 17 out of 31 passes for 206 yards, will be in top form, and it is
hoped that he will repeat his 1950 performance.
Stanford this weekend will depend a lot on The Pass, and Cal hope to
i cope with it by rushing Kerkorian rather than trying the impof . ible
that of bottlinc McColl. All we can say is that USC used the same strategy
a few weeks ago, and Kerkorian completed 18 out of 32 passes.
The beauty of Gary's passing, however, is that it's backed up by i hard

driving running game. Composing this running crow am Hugasian, Bob
Meyers, Wps Laubscher, Eric Southwood, ami Bob Mathias, anv one of
whom can 30 all the way.
Indian Defense Knows Ilnw l«> Mold
In the lino, MeColl, Bill Slorum, Jim Vick, John BroHrrirk. Nunn Man-
Jack Bonet'i. and Don Tobin provide the power to rnp Gary on his
pa">c* and to open a hole somewhere when the Cards decide to take th
bal! on the ground.
Defensive-wise the Indians have come up with a tremendous combine
which has a habit of holding when they have to. Manske has said of ends
Bon Kadie and Jac k Rye thrt he'd trade all four of his for them. Here
we're forced to a tree with Eggs, for Eadic and Bye provide the greatest
defensive end combo on the coast.
At tackles will be Al Kirkland and Bob Latham, a pair who !o*'e to
smear the opposition's interference, and at guards are Leon King and Cone
or Cook. There boys arc seldom moved.
At linebacker are Chuck Fssegian and Tori Tanner, who are rough tacklers
and sod detectors. They II be in for a rough afternoon Saturday stop
ping the Bear runners.
In tho hack field eompoed of Bob Thompson, Don Sanders, and Diek
Horn you have the boys who lead the PCC in pass defense along with the
linehaekin? crew. Freshman Sanders is the nicest thing that's happened to
Stanford in a long tim?. A sure tackier. Don is a hard man to move out
of the way of a runner. Thompson, a swimmer in the spring, is another
rough tackier an'I a good man at batting flown passes.
As for Horn — "The Saviour"
A.* for Horn— well, what can we say about him that hasn't been repeated
over and over, lie can he called the Indians' saviour, for time after time
be has been the last man to meet the opposing runners and he's come
through with price) timing and tackling. A nominee for All-Coast and All-
American honors. Dick also does a little punting for the Tribe, awl at present
is third in the Conference with a healthy .'Jfl.Jt yards average.
Well, there you have it for the 54th Big Game. Saturday. Stanford goes
out to get the axe, which hasn't been :;ccn in these parts since Stanford
lost to Cal in 1047, 21 to 18.

if they do, they'll never get their helmets on and Cal will walk ai! over them.
Not only could this take efTect on Stanford, but it has taken effect on
the Bears. It's got them roaring mad. They would rather knock off Stanford
—particularly in the undefeated condition in which they now repose—than
eat dinner. And you can forget this stuff about Cal not having the team to
do it. They've got more than enough.
Cal Conference Hushing Champion
As the records now stand, California leads the Conference in rushing
with a neat .1081 yards in nine games for a 304.2 average. Stanford sits in
fourth place with 2114 and a 199.8 average. In total offense California still
j leads with 3624 yards and 402.7 average, while Stanford has gained 3227 tor
a 358.5 average. This gives the Boars a nice edge.
Now consider the fact that California undoubtedly will play their be:!.
| game of the season and remember that earlier this year they were the num
I her one team in the nation. Don't try to repress the fact that in their first
three games they beat Santa Clara 34 to 0, Pennsylvania 35 to 0, and Minn
: esota 55 to 14. They were great then, and they're going to play their be. t.
game this Saturday.
j California has caught the dreaded Indian disease this year—injuriti;.
This disease, which has hung around the Farm for the past few years, has
been cured in the Stanford training quarters for the most part, but it ha,
j spread to the Berkeley campus. At the same time the Cards have conic up
I with something the Bears were thought to monopolize.
In the past when a Bear was injured. Pappy would come up with someone
who would play a better game than the injured man ever could. Thi ; season
Stanford has developed that "disease." When Jesse Cone, the Indians' All -
j Coast nominee for defensive guard honors, was injured in the Santa Clara
; game, Taylor came up with Hart Cook, a little heard of but tremendous
j lineman who has since done a terrific job of filling in.
Last week with Harry Hugasian on the mend with a broken toe. Bob
Meyers filled in and played the outstanding game of the day.
However, don't let all of this sway you. The Bears, unlike what Man
| would have you believe, are not walking around on crutches. True, they
; have injury problems, but nothing so that they won't get out there Saturday
and score a few times Cal's biggest injury has been Johnny Olszewski';
j knee, injured in the USC game and re injured against Washington. Pappy' ;
i not talking, but you can lay a sizeable bet that. Johnny O will ramble
this weekend, and he's dangerous in any league.
Bears Have All-American, Too
Speaking of danger, the Bears have an Ail-American named l«es Richfer.
| He's a linebacker, and you'll see a lot of him Saturday. In last year's Big
Game it was Richter who intercepted a pass to break tip a Stanford threat,
for the winning touchdown. On a given Saturday—and you can call th
Saturday that given one—Pichter could make USC's Pat Cannamela lool
like a toy. and if you'll remember, Cannamela was no easy man to handle
And that's not all Cal has. In their baekfield they have Billy Mai at,
quarter. Mais is a good faker and. though not the passer that Kerkorian ]-.
: is a dangerous man in the air when the occasion calls for it. You'll ;lso
see a lot of Don Johnson, Don Harris, and Harry West.
As for the offensive line, Cal has one of the best in the Conference They
1 don't handle easily, particularly Bob Karpe, Ralph Krucger, and Ozzie
j Harris.
The Bear defense is reputed to be weak. Don't believe it. At the be
ginning of the season they were unseored upon until third third game, , nr?
; remember they'll play their best game Saturday. You'll see c lot of tackles
by defensive ha Ifs Dick LemMon and Sain Williams,, if his injury permits,
| and if the Card backs get beyond \he line of scrimmage.
On the Stanford side of the picture things look blight. With the excep
! tion of halfback Hon Cook, the Indians will be at full strength for the bu
, one. Some of the boys will see only a little action because of previous in
i juries, but they'll be backed up well.
General Gary Kerkorian, who last year had his best day in the Big Gain. l
completing 17 out of 31 passes for 206 yards, will be in top form, and it is
hoped that he will repeat his 1950 performance.
Stanford this weekend will depend a lot on The Pass, and Cal hope to
i cope with it by rushing Kerkorian rather than trying the impof . ible
that of bottlinc McColl. All we can say is that USC used the same strategy
a few weeks ago, and Kerkorian completed 18 out of 32 passes.
The beauty of Gary's passing, however, is that it's backed up by i hard

driving running game. Composing this running crow am Hugasian, Bob
Meyers, Wps Laubscher, Eric Southwood, ami Bob Mathias, anv one of
whom can 30 all the way.
Indian Defense Knows Ilnw l«> Mold
In the lino, MeColl, Bill Slorum, Jim Vick, John BroHrrirk. Nunn Man-
Jack Bonet'i. and Don Tobin provide the power to rnp Gary on his
pa">c* and to open a hole somewhere when the Cards decide to take th
bal! on the ground.
Defensive-wise the Indians have come up with a tremendous combine
which has a habit of holding when they have to. Manske has said of ends
Bon Kadie and Jac k Rye thrt he'd trade all four of his for them. Here
we're forced to a tree with Eggs, for Eadic and Bye provide the greatest
defensive end combo on the coast.
At tackles will be Al Kirkland and Bob Latham, a pair who !o*'e to
smear the opposition's interference, and at guards are Leon King and Cone
or Cook. There boys arc seldom moved.
At linebacker are Chuck Fssegian and Tori Tanner, who are rough tacklers
and sod detectors. They II be in for a rough afternoon Saturday stop
ping the Bear runners.
In tho hack field eompoed of Bob Thompson, Don Sanders, and Diek
Horn you have the boys who lead the PCC in pass defense along with the
linehaekin? crew. Freshman Sanders is the nicest thing that's happened to
Stanford in a long tim?. A sure tackier. Don is a hard man to move out
of the way of a runner. Thompson, a swimmer in the spring, is another
rough tackier an'I a good man at batting flown passes.
As for Horn — "The Saviour"
A.* for Horn— well, what can we say about him that hasn't been repeated
over and over, lie can he called the Indians' saviour, for time after time
be has been the last man to meet the opposing runners and he's come
through with price) timing and tackling. A nominee for All-Coast and All-
American honors. Dick also does a little punting for the Tribe, awl at present
is third in the Conference with a healthy .'Jfl.Jt yards average.
Well, there you have it for the 54th Big Game. Saturday. Stanford goes
out to get the axe, which hasn't been :;ccn in these parts since Stanford
lost to Cal in 1047, 21 to 18.
Forget the Rose Bowl! Forget the PCC championship! Forge*
studies! This is the Big Game! This is what Chuck Taylor and his
J boys have been, looking forward to for a long time.
When it comes to Big Games there's been a famine on the Farm
for four years, and the Stanford varsity would Like to end it right
now. For four years Stanford has walked into the big Game as
lowly underdogs and played their greatest game of the year only
to walk out of the stadium without a victory.
This year, glory bo. the Indians will go into the game favored to bring
home the axr. This the present band of Indians aren't used to, but they
aren't hothered by odds, knowing that they never comr out right in the
] Big Game anyhow.
California, on the other hand, finds itself in the position of lowly ones;
and, aware of what Stanford has done the past three years in that spot,
is making the most of it. In faet, California has spent the latter part of the
| season in an attempt to set up the greatest psychological defeat in history,
i Stanford, with Chuck Taylor and his peerless predictions, is not used to
; the old crying towel and is more apt to fall for a tear than anyone else,
i and the Bears realize that. Because of that. Pappy Waldorf has had his
| end coach and head scout, "Egg.." Manske, hard at work inflating the
j Cards' ego.
.Manske Predicts R'»ut
\ Man.ske wa.<; a master after the USC game when he '-aid in effect:
"Stanford is a wonderful team. Kerkorian is a wonderful, passer. MeColl
j is a wonderful receiver. Wonderful players man every position.
: "It really isn't fair that we should have to meet such a wonderful bunch
It will be murder. Pitifully few and crippled as we are, we won't stand *
j chance.
"The humane authorities ought to step in and rail the whole thing off."
Monday, after Stanford's ninth win. Manske at the spnrtswriter's luneh
j eon in San Francisco broke out the crocodiles again. In fact he did such
, a good job that Waldorf had to assure everyone that Cal would show up
i for the game.
Now. if this isn't a perfect piece of psychological waifare, we should have
flunked Psych 51.
In short, Manske. Pappy, his boys, and the whole Crfl campus would be
[ deleriously happy if the Indians were to believe Manske's gushings. And
if they do, they'll never get their helmets on and Cal will walk ai! over them.

and score a few times Cal's biggest injury has been Johnny Olszewski';
j knee, injured in the USC game and re injured against Washington. Pappy' ;
i not talking, but you can lay a sizeable bet that. Johnny O will ramble
this weekend, and he's dangerous in any league.
Bears Have All-American, Too
Speaking of danger, the Bears have an Ail-American named l«es Richfer.
| He's a linebacker, and you'll see a lot of him Saturday. In last year's Big
Game it was Richter who intercepted a pass to break tip a Stanford threat,
for the winning touchdown. On a given Saturday—and you can call th
Saturday that given one—Pichter could make USC's Pat Cannamela lool
like a toy. and if you'll remember, Cannamela was no easy man to handle
And that's not all Cal has. In their baekfield they have Billy Mai at,
quarter. Mais is a good faker and. though not the passer that Kerkorian ]-.
: is a dangerous man in the air when the occasion calls for it. You'll ;lso
see a lot of Don Johnson, Don Harris, and Harry West.
As for the offensive line, Cal has one of the best in the Conference They
1 don't handle easily, particularly Bob Karpe, Ralph Krucger, and Ozzie
j Harris.
The Bear defense is reputed to be weak. Don't believe it. At the be
ginning of the season they were unseored upon until third third game, , nr?
; remember they'll play their best game Saturday. You'll see c lot of tackles
by defensive ha Ifs Dick LemMon and Sain Williams,, if his injury permits,
| and if the Card backs get beyond \he line of scrimmage.
On the Stanford side of the picture things look blight. With the excep
! tion of halfback Hon Cook, the Indians will be at full strength for the bu
, one. Some of the boys will see only a little action because of previous in
i juries, but they'll be backed up well.
General Gary Kerkorian, who last year had his best day in the Big Gain. l
completing 17 out of 31 passes for 206 yards, will be in top form, and it is
hoped that he will repeat his 1950 performance.
Stanford this weekend will depend a lot on The Pass, and Cal hope to
i cope with it by rushing Kerkorian rather than trying the impof . ible
that of bottlinc McColl. All we can say is that USC used the same strategy
a few weeks ago, and Kerkorian completed 18 out of 32 passes.
The beauty of Gary's passing, however, is that it's backed up by i hard

driving running game. Composing this running crow am Hugasian, Bob
Meyers, Wps Laubscher, Eric Southwood, ami Bob Mathias, anv one of
whom can 30 all the way.
Indian Defense Knows Ilnw l«> Mold
In the lino, MeColl, Bill Slorum, Jim Vick, John BroHrrirk. Nunn Man-
Jack Bonet'i. and Don Tobin provide the power to rnp Gary on his
pa">c* and to open a hole somewhere when the Cards decide to take th
bal! on the ground.
Defensive-wise the Indians have come up with a tremendous combine
which has a habit of holding when they have to. Manske has said of ends
Bon Kadie and Jac k Rye thrt he'd trade all four of his for them. Here
we're forced to a tree with Eggs, for Eadic and Bye provide the greatest
defensive end combo on the coast.
At tackles will be Al Kirkland and Bob Latham, a pair who !o*'e to
smear the opposition's interference, and at guards are Leon King and Cone
or Cook. There boys arc seldom moved.
At linebacker are Chuck Fssegian and Tori Tanner, who are rough tacklers
and sod detectors. They II be in for a rough afternoon Saturday stop
ping the Bear runners.
In tho hack field eompoed of Bob Thompson, Don Sanders, and Diek
Horn you have the boys who lead the PCC in pass defense along with the
linehaekin? crew. Freshman Sanders is the nicest thing that's happened to
Stanford in a long tim?. A sure tackier. Don is a hard man to move out
of the way of a runner. Thompson, a swimmer in the spring, is another
rough tackier an'I a good man at batting flown passes.
As for Horn — "The Saviour"
A.* for Horn— well, what can we say about him that hasn't been repeated
over and over, lie can he called the Indians' saviour, for time after time
be has been the last man to meet the opposing runners and he's come
through with price) timing and tackling. A nominee for All-Coast and All-
American honors. Dick also does a little punting for the Tribe, awl at present
is third in the Conference with a healthy .'Jfl.Jt yards average.
Well, there you have it for the 54th Big Game. Saturday. Stanford goes
out to get the axe, which hasn't been :;ccn in these parts since Stanford
lost to Cal in 1047, 21 to 18.
Forget the Rose Bowl! Forget the PCC championship! Forge*
studies! This is the Big Game! This is what Chuck Taylor and his
J boys have been, looking forward to for a long time.
When it comes to Big Games there's been a famine on the Farm
for four years, and the Stanford varsity would Like to end it right
now. For four years Stanford has walked into the big Game as
lowly underdogs and played their greatest game of the year only
to walk out of the stadium without a victory.
This year, glory bo. the Indians will go into the game favored to bring
home the axr. This the present band of Indians aren't used to, but they
aren't hothered by odds, knowing that they never comr out right in the
] Big Game anyhow.
California, on the other hand, finds itself in the position of lowly ones;
and, aware of what Stanford has done the past three years in that spot,
is making the most of it. In faet, California has spent the latter part of the
| season in an attempt to set up the greatest psychological defeat in history,
i Stanford, with Chuck Taylor and his peerless predictions, is not used to
; the old crying towel and is more apt to fall for a tear than anyone else,
i and the Bears realize that. Because of that. Pappy Waldorf has had his
| end coach and head scout, "Egg.." Manske, hard at work inflating the
j Cards' ego.
.Manske Predicts R'»ut
\ Man.ske wa.<; a master after the USC game when he '-aid in effect:
"Stanford is a wonderful team. Kerkorian is a wonderful, passer. MeColl
j is a wonderful receiver. Wonderful players man every position.
: "It really isn't fair that we should have to meet such a wonderful bunch
It will be murder. Pitifully few and crippled as we are, we won't stand *
j chance.
"The humane authorities ought to step in and rail the whole thing off."
Monday, after Stanford's ninth win. Manske at the spnrtswriter's luneh
j eon in San Francisco broke out the crocodiles again. In fact he did such
, a good job that Waldorf had to assure everyone that Cal would show up
i for the game.
Now. if this isn't a perfect piece of psychological waifare, we should have
flunked Psych 51.
In short, Manske. Pappy, his boys, and the whole Crfl campus would be
[ deleriously happy if the Indians were to believe Manske's gushings. And
if they do, they'll never get their helmets on and Cal will walk ai! over them.
Not only could this take efTect on Stanford, but it has taken effect on
the Bears. It's got them roaring mad. They would rather knock off Stanford
—particularly in the undefeated condition in which they now repose—than
eat dinner. And you can forget this stuff about Cal not having the team to
do it. They've got more than enough.
Cal Conference Hushing Champion
As the records now stand, California leads the Conference in rushing
with a neat .1081 yards in nine games for a 304.2 average. Stanford sits in
fourth place with 2114 and a 199.8 average. In total offense California still
j leads with 3624 yards and 402.7 average, while Stanford has gained 3227 tor
a 358.5 average. This gives the Boars a nice edge.
Now consider the fact that California undoubtedly will play their be:!.
| game of the season and remember that earlier this year they were the num
I her one team in the nation. Don't try to repress the fact that in their first
three games they beat Santa Clara 34 to 0, Pennsylvania 35 to 0, and Minn
: esota 55 to 14. They were great then, and they're going to play their be. t.
game this Saturday.
j California has caught the dreaded Indian disease this year—injuriti;.
This disease, which has hung around the Farm for the past few years, has
been cured in the Stanford training quarters for the most part, but it ha,
j spread to the Berkeley campus. At the same time the Cards have conic up
I with something the Bears were thought to monopolize.
In the past when a Bear was injured. Pappy would come up with someone
who would play a better game than the injured man ever could. Thi ; season
Stanford has developed that "disease." When Jesse Cone, the Indians' All -
j Coast nominee for defensive guard honors, was injured in the Santa Clara
; game, Taylor came up with Hart Cook, a little heard of but tremendous
j lineman who has since done a terrific job of filling in.
Last week with Harry Hugasian on the mend with a broken toe. Bob
Meyers filled in and played the outstanding game of the day.
However, don't let all of this sway you. The Bears, unlike what Man
| would have you believe, are not walking around on crutches. True, they
; have injury problems, but nothing so that they won't get out there Saturday

a few weeks ago, and Kerkorian completed 18 out of 32 passes.
The beauty of Gary's passing, however, is that it's backed up by i hard

driving running game. Composing this running crow am Hugasian, Bob

Indian Defense Knows Ilnw l«> Mold
In the lino, MeColl, Bill Slorum, Jim Vick, John BroHrrirk. Nunn Man-
Jack Bonet'i. and Don Tobin provide the power to rnp Gary on his
pa">c* and to open a hole somewhere when the Cards decide to take th
bal! on the ground.
Defensive-wise the Indians have come up with a tremendous combine
which has a habit of holding when they have to. Manske has said of ends
Bon Kadie and Jac k Rye thrt he'd trade all four of his for them. Here
we're forced to a tree with Eggs, for Eadic and Bye provide the greatest
defensive end combo on the coast.
At tackles will be Al Kirkland and Bob Latham, a pair who !o*'e to
smear the opposition's interference, and at guards are Leon King and Cone
or Cook. There boys arc seldom moved.
At linebacker are Chuck Fssegian and Tori Tanner, who are rough tacklers
and sod detectors. They II be in for a rough afternoon Saturday stop
ping the Bear runners.
In tho hack field eompoed of Bob Thompson, Don Sanders, and Diek
Horn you have the boys who lead the PCC in pass defense along with the
linehaekin? crew. Freshman Sanders is the nicest thing that's happened to
Stanford in a long tim?. A sure tackier. Don is a hard man to move out
of the way of a runner. Thompson, a swimmer in the spring, is another
rough tackier an'I a good man at batting flown passes.
As for Horn — "The Saviour"
A.* for Horn— well, what can we say about him that hasn't been repeated
over and over, lie can he called the Indians' saviour, for time after time
be has been the last man to meet the opposing runners and he's come
through with price) timing and tackling. A nominee for All-Coast and All-
American honors. Dick also does a little punting for the Tribe, awl at present
is third in the Conference with a healthy .'Jfl.Jt yards average.
Well, there you have it for the 54th Big Game. Saturday. Stanford goes
out to get the axe, which hasn't been :;ccn in these parts since Stanford
lost to Cal in 1047, 21 to 18.
Forget the Rose Bowl! Forget the PCC championship! Forge*
studies! This is the Big Game! This is what Chuck Taylor and his
J boys have been, looking forward to for a long time.
When it comes to Big Games there's been a famine on the Farm
for four years, and the Stanford varsity would Like to end it right
now. For four years Stanford has walked into the big Game as
lowly underdogs and played their greatest game of the year only
to walk out of the stadium without a victory.
This year, glory bo. the Indians will go into the game favored to bring
home the axr. This the present band of Indians aren't used to, but they
aren't hothered by odds, knowing that they never comr out right in the
] Big Game anyhow.
California, on the other hand, finds itself in the position of lowly ones;
and, aware of what Stanford has done the past three years in that spot,
is making the most of it. In faet, California has spent the latter part of the
| season in an attempt to set up the greatest psychological defeat in history,
i Stanford, with Chuck Taylor and his peerless predictions, is not used to
; the old crying towel and is more apt to fall for a tear than anyone else,
i and the Bears realize that. Because of that. Pappy Waldorf has had his
| end coach and head scout, "Egg.." Manske, hard at work inflating the
j Cards' ego.
.Manske Predicts R'»ut
\ Man.ske wa.<; a master after the USC game when he '-aid in effect:
"Stanford is a wonderful team. Kerkorian is a wonderful, passer. MeColl
j is a wonderful receiver. Wonderful players man every position.
: "It really isn't fair that we should have to meet such a wonderful bunch
It will be murder. Pitifully few and crippled as we are, we won't stand *
j chance.
"The humane authorities ought to step in and rail the whole thing off."
Monday, after Stanford's ninth win. Manske at the spnrtswriter's luneh
j eon in San Francisco broke out the crocodiles again. In fact he did such
, a good job that Waldorf had to assure everyone that Cal would show up
i for the game.
Now. if this isn't a perfect piece of psychological waifare, we should have
flunked Psych 51.
In short, Manske. Pappy, his boys, and the whole Crfl campus would be
[ deleriously happy if the Indians were to believe Manske's gushings. And
if they do, they'll never get their helmets on and Cal will walk ai! over them.
Not only could this take efTect on Stanford, but it has taken effect on
the Bears. It's got them roaring mad. They would rather knock off Stanford
—particularly in the undefeated condition in which they now repose—than
eat dinner. And you can forget this stuff about Cal not having the team to
do it. They've got more than enough.
Cal Conference Hushing Champion
As the records now stand, California leads the Conference in rushing
with a neat .1081 yards in nine games for a 304.2 average. Stanford sits in
fourth place with 2114 and a 199.8 average. In total offense California still
j leads with 3624 yards and 402.7 average, while Stanford has gained 3227 tor
a 358.5 average. This gives the Boars a nice edge.
Now consider the fact that California undoubtedly will play their be:!.
| game of the season and remember that earlier this year they were the num
I her one team in the nation. Don't try to repress the fact that in their first
three games they beat Santa Clara 34 to 0, Pennsylvania 35 to 0, and Minn
: esota 55 to 14. They were great then, and they're going to play their be. t.
game this Saturday.
j California has caught the dreaded Indian disease this year—injuriti;.
This disease, which has hung around the Farm for the past few years, has
been cured in the Stanford training quarters for the most part, but it ha,
j spread to the Berkeley campus. At the same time the Cards have conic up
I with something the Bears were thought to monopolize.
In the past when a Bear was injured. Pappy would come up with someone
who would play a better game than the injured man ever could. Thi ; season
Stanford has developed that "disease." When Jesse Cone, the Indians' All -
j Coast nominee for defensive guard honors, was injured in the Santa Clara
; game, Taylor came up with Hart Cook, a little heard of but tremendous
j lineman who has since done a terrific job of filling in.
Last week with Harry Hugasian on the mend with a broken toe. Bob
Meyers filled in and played the outstanding game of the day.
However, don't let all of this sway you. The Bears, unlike what Man
| would have you believe, are not walking around on crutches. True, they
; have injury problems, but nothing so that they won't get out there Saturday
and score a few times Cal's biggest injury has been Johnny Olszewski';
j knee, injured in the USC game and re injured against Washington. Pappy' ;
i not talking, but you can lay a sizeable bet that. Johnny O will ramble
this weekend, and he's dangerous in any league.
Bears Have All-American, Too
Speaking of danger, the Bears have an Ail-American named l«es Richfer.
| He's a linebacker, and you'll see a lot of him Saturday. In last year's Big
Game it was Richter who intercepted a pass to break tip a Stanford threat,
for the winning touchdown. On a given Saturday—and you can call th
Saturday that given one—Pichter could make USC's Pat Cannamela lool
like a toy. and if you'll remember, Cannamela was no easy man to handle
And that's not all Cal has. In their baekfield they have Billy Mai at,
quarter. Mais is a good faker and. though not the passer that Kerkorian ]-.
: is a dangerous man in the air when the occasion calls for it. You'll ;lso
see a lot of Don Johnson, Don Harris, and Harry West.
As for the offensive line, Cal has one of the best in the Conference They
1 don't handle easily, particularly Bob Karpe, Ralph Krucger, and Ozzie
j Harris.
The Bear defense is reputed to be weak. Don't believe it. At the be
ginning of the season they were unseored upon until third third game, , nr?
; remember they'll play their best game Saturday. You'll see c lot of tackles
by defensive ha Ifs Dick LemMon and Sain Williams,, if his injury permits,
| and if the Card backs get beyond \he line of scrimmage.
On the Stanford side of the picture things look blight. With the excep
! tion of halfback Hon Cook, the Indians will be at full strength for the bu
, one. Some of the boys will see only a little action because of previous in
i juries, but they'll be backed up well.
General Gary Kerkorian, who last year had his best day in the Big Gain. l
completing 17 out of 31 passes for 206 yards, will be in top form, and it is
hoped that he will repeat his 1950 performance.
Stanford this weekend will depend a lot on The Pass, and Cal hope to
i cope with it by rushing Kerkorian rather than trying the impof . ible
that of bottlinc McColl. All we can say is that USC used the same strategy
a few weeks ago, and Kerkorian completed 18 out of 32 passes.

In short, Manske. Pappy, his boys, and the whole Crfl campus would be
[ deleriously happy if the Indians were to believe Manske's gushings. And
if they do, they'll never get their helmets on and Cal will walk ai! over them.
Not only could this take efTect on Stanford, but it has taken effect on
the Bears. It's got them roaring mad. They would rather knock off Stanford
—particularly in the undefeated condition in which they now repose—than
eat dinner. And you can forget this stuff about Cal not having the team to
do it. They've got more than enough.
Cal Conference Hushing Champion
As the records now stand, California leads the Conference in rushing
with a neat .1081 yards in nine games for a 304.2 average. Stanford sits in
fourth place with 2114 and a 199.8 average. In total offense California still
j leads with 3624 yards and 402.7 average, while Stanford has gained 3227 tor
a 358.5 average. This gives the Boars a nice edge.
Now consider the fact that California undoubtedly will play their be:!.
| game of the season and remember that earlier this year they were the num
I her one team in the nation. Don't try to repress the fact that in their first
three games they beat Santa Clara 34 to 0, Pennsylvania 35 to 0, and Minn
: esota 55 to 14. They were great then, and they're going to play their be. t.
game this Saturday.
j California has caught the dreaded Indian disease this year—injuriti;.
This disease, which has hung around the Farm for the past few years, has
been cured in the Stanford training quarters for the most part, but it ha,
j spread to the Berkeley campus. At the same time the Cards have conic up
I with something the Bears were thought to monopolize.
In the past when a Bear was injured. Pappy would come up with someone
who would play a better game than the injured man ever could. Thi ; season
Stanford has developed that "disease." When Jesse Cone, the Indians' All -
j Coast nominee for defensive guard honors, was injured in the Santa Clara
; game, Taylor came up with Hart Cook, a little heard of but tremendous
j lineman who has since done a terrific job of filling in.
Last week with Harry Hugasian on the mend with a broken toe. Bob
Meyers filled in and played the outstanding game of the day.
However, don't let all of this sway you. The Bears, unlike what Man
| would have you believe, are not walking around on crutches. True, they
; have injury problems, but nothing so that they won't get out there Saturday
and score a few times Cal's biggest injury has been Johnny Olszewski';
j knee, injured in the USC game and re injured against Washington. Pappy' ;
i not talking, but you can lay a sizeable bet that. Johnny O will ramble
this weekend, and he's dangerous in any league.
Bears Have All-American, Too
Speaking of danger, the Bears have an Ail-American named l«es Richfer.
| He's a linebacker, and you'll see a lot of him Saturday. In last year's Big
Game it was Richter who intercepted a pass to break tip a Stanford threat,
for the winning touchdown. On a given Saturday—and you can call th
Saturday that given one—Pichter could make USC's Pat Cannamela lool
like a toy. and if you'll remember, Cannamela was no easy man to handle
And that's not all Cal has. In their baekfield they have Billy Mai at,
quarter. Mais is a good faker and. though not the passer that Kerkorian ]-.
: is a dangerous man in the air when the occasion calls for it. You'll ;lso
see a lot of Don Johnson, Don Harris, and Harry West.
As for the offensive line, Cal has one of the best in the Conference They
1 don't handle easily, particularly Bob Karpe, Ralph Krucger, and Ozzie
j Harris.
The Bear defense is reputed to be weak. Don't believe it. At the be
ginning of the season they were unseored upon until third third game, , nr?
; remember they'll play their best game Saturday. You'll see c lot of tackles
by defensive ha Ifs Dick LemMon and Sain Williams,, if his injury permits,
| and if the Card backs get beyond \he line of scrimmage.
On the Stanford side of the picture things look blight. With the excep
! tion of halfback Hon Cook, the Indians will be at full strength for the bu
, one. Some of the boys will see only a little action because of previous in
i juries, but they'll be backed up well.
General Gary Kerkorian, who last year had his best day in the Big Gain. l
completing 17 out of 31 passes for 206 yards, will be in top form, and it is
hoped that he will repeat his 1950 performance.
Stanford this weekend will depend a lot on The Pass, and Cal hope to
i cope with it by rushing Kerkorian rather than trying the impof . ible
that of bottlinc McColl. All we can say is that USC used the same strategy
a few weeks ago, and Kerkorian completed 18 out of 32 passes.
The beauty of Gary's passing, however, is that it's backed up by i hard

driving running game. Composing this running crow am Hugasian, Bob
Meyers, Wps Laubscher, Eric Southwood, ami Bob Mathias, anv one of
whom can 30 all the way.
Indian Defense Knows Ilnw l«> Mold

Jack Bonet'i. and Don Tobin provide the power to rnp Gary on his
pa">c* and to open a hole somewhere when the Cards decide to take th
bal! on the ground.
Defensive-wise the Indians have come up with a tremendous combine

we're forced to a tree with Eggs, for Eadic and Bye provide the greatest
defensive end combo on the coast.
At tackles will be Al Kirkland and Bob Latham, a pair who !o*'e to

At linebacker are Chuck Fssegian and Tori Tanner, who are rough tacklers

Stanford in a long tim?. A sure tackier. Don is a hard man to move out
of the way of a runner. Thompson, a swimmer in the spring, is another
rough tackier an'I a good man at batting flown passes.
As for Horn — "The Saviour"

Forget the Rose Bowl! Forget the PCC championship! Forge*
studies! This is the Big Game! This is what Chuck Taylor and his
J boys have been, looking forward to for a long time.
When it comes to Big Games there's been a famine on the Farm
for four years, and the Stanford varsity would Like to end it right
now. For four years Stanford has walked into the big Game as
lowly underdogs and played their greatest game of the year only
to walk out of the stadium without a victory.
This year, glory bo. the Indians will go into the game favored to bring
home the axr. This the present band of Indians aren't used to, but they
aren't hothered by odds, knowing that they never comr out right in the
] Big Game anyhow.
California, on the other hand, finds itself in the position of lowly ones;
and, aware of what Stanford has done the past three years in that spot,
is making the most of it. In faet, California has spent the latter part of the
| season in an attempt to set up the greatest psychological defeat in history,
i Stanford, with Chuck Taylor and his peerless predictions, is not used to
; the old crying towel and is more apt to fall for a tear than anyone else,
i and the Bears realize that. Because of that. Pappy Waldorf has had his
| end coach and head scout, "Egg.." Manske, hard at work inflating the
j Cards' ego.
.Manske Predicts R'»ut
\ Man.ske wa.<; a master after the USC game when he '-aid in effect:
"Stanford is a wonderful team. Kerkorian is a wonderful, passer. MeColl
j is a wonderful receiver. Wonderful players man every position.
: "It really isn't fair that we should have to meet such a wonderful bunch
It will be murder. Pitifully few and crippled as we are, we won't stand *
j chance.
"The humane authorities ought to step in and rail the whole thing off."
Monday, after Stanford's ninth win. Manske at the spnrtswriter's luneh
j eon in San Francisco broke out the crocodiles again. In fact he did such
, a good job that Waldorf had to assure everyone that Cal would show up
i for the game.
Now. if this isn't a perfect piece of psychological waifare, we should have
flunked Psych 51.
In short, Manske. Pappy, his boys, and the whole Crfl campus would be
[ deleriously happy if the Indians were to believe Manske's gushings. And
if they do, they'll never get their helmets on and Cal will walk ai! over them.
Not only could this take efTect on Stanford, but it has taken effect on
the Bears. It's got them roaring mad. They would rather knock off Stanford
—particularly in the undefeated condition in which they now repose—than
eat dinner. And you can forget this stuff about Cal not having the team to
