# A 						Battle for an Axe
## 
### 
So it's down to the wire Saturday for Big
Game, the football contest that's more than just
another game. Saturday's battle will be the
fifty fourth renewal of the nation's top gridiron
rivalry.
As far as v/e're concerned, the Rose Bowl
doesn't exist this week. Before roses, the axe.
-That sawed off symbol of gridiron might has
stayed in Berkeley too long.
As the footballers prepare in sloppy weather
for the Big One, the campus at large is prepar
ing for the many events preceeding the game,
noi the least of which is Thanksgiving Day. We
might even say "before roses and before axes,
the turkey."
Before and after the turkey is disposed of
tomorrow a full slate of events is on tap for
everyone as tempo builds up for the Saturday
climax. By the way, if anyone still has doubts
about whether to go home or stay on campus
for the holidays, all concerned with pre-game
activities offer a prayer in unison for a decision
to stay here. It will take a lot of cooperation

from the student body to make such events as
the bonfire rally a good success.
As for the weather, at least two reports we've
heard in the past hour promise better weather
immediately. To the struggling frosh who are
building the fire in the not-so-dry bed of Lake
Lag, this must be good news.
Back to the game itself, we're confident of
the outcome. A team with the heart plus the
ability of the 1951 Stanford eleven won't toss
away the biggest one of the year. Can anyone
who saw the Cards run El Trojan out of the
Coliseum two weeks ago doubt that we'll beal
the Bear? Good luck, Indians!
