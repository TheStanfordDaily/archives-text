# The 						'Big' Can Get Too Big

(The following editorial was written by Dick
Klein, Daily staff member and a member of
the Fundamental Standard Committee.)
It's that time of the year again. It's time for
the biggest. It's the Big Game on Saturday. The
Big Game Gaieties, the Big Game Week Ac
tivities, and, of course the Big Blast after the
game. All this adds up to a fine tradition and
just about the finest weekend in the Stanford
year.
It can stay a fine tradition and be great and
a lot of fun just as long as we want it that way.
Bat, in recent years, many have accused ihe
student body for disorderly conduct and
rowdyism and drunken destructiveness on that
Saturday night. If that's the case, the Big is
getting out of hand and the whole weekend is
being undermined.
We are well aware of how visiting South
ern Cal students carried on in San Francisco
after they upset Cal. They tore up the town,
and more than just literally speaking. And
they got a bad press because of their conduct.
The same thing was true of many Stanford
alums whooping it up too energetically in
Los Angeles and then on the train coming
back up North. It was easy for us to be criti
cal of their bad showings then, arid we were
right in our criticism.
The important thing about this Big Game and
after-the-game celebrations is that right now
Ihe national spotlight is on us. Our football
team is way up in the grid press polls and v/e

are Rose Bowl bound. We are great stuff for
journalists to write scathing articles about.
That's their meat. The time is similarly perfect
for us to shape up and use our heads in Satur
day night celebrating. For sure, have a good
party, a lot of fun and a big blow-off. But not
beyond that. Stanford is something that we all
have learned to love and respect. Our Univer
sity has a fine reputation all over the country.
If we can just keep all these things in mind
and use a little judgment in our celebrating,
then there will be no trouble. The problem
disappears. Then there will be no chance of
certain individuals spoiling the good time of the
entire group. Or of reflecting on the group or
upon Stanford's reputation. In addition, there
is always the financial responsibility that the
group must absorb when an individual or small
minority gets out of hand.
Even though the parties are put on by liv
ing groups and are held off-campus all over
the Bay Area, we should still be guided by the
simple, sincere practices that the Funda
mental Standard sets forth for us. Conduct
ourselves in a manner befitting our social
habits and rules cf the time. Act like gentle
men at all times.
If we follow this rule on the Big Saturday
night, as we do on all other occasions, then
there will be no danger of harming the repu
tation of our school or of ourselves. It's that
easy. And it's the only way to keep Big Game
night.â€” D.K.
