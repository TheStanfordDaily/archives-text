### DICK McLEAN 
THE AXE
Remember the Big Game of forty-seven? They took
the axe eway but not without a battle, by God. Cal
won the game and won the nxe but lost the real victory
that day. Because a bunch of men, the Andersons
and Fixes, the Quists juid McKitricks, didn't seem to
know the odds and wouldn't quit. T ' h " Rear

came down to Palo Alto for an
afternoon's diversion and nearly
lost his golden hide. And but for
a wobbly pass and a tackle missed,
and two minutes and fifty-eight
seconds, we would have won.
And the student body erected a
plaque in honor of a coach and
team that had lost nine games
' But nj ver lost the will to win."
We nearly kept the axe that
,\ejir. Hut just not quite.

Hemember the Big Game of forty-eight? I don't
think that anyone who saw it will ever forget. Cali
fornia wak the big favorite as usual but some sports
writers weron t too sure. Emery Mitchell was wheeled
into the stadium mid a great ovation. It was his first
day out o) the hospital after a powerful Army team
had nearly torn his knee off. (The doctors said he'd
never play again). That was the year that Rock
Campbell was hurt so badly on the first play of the
game. Ha lay on the field writhing in a convulsion.
When he was taken out in the ambulance, all the men
• tood up und took their hats off.
Cal scored early and many thought that the pre
dicted slaughter was about to begin. But they were
ww>ng. Stanford held. Shaw pass to Rose turned the
tide but the margin ol victory whs a point after touch
down that fell a bit too low.
We nearly won that year. too. But inst not «|iiile.
Keineniber the Big Game of forty-nine? Stanford

had a promising team dial vear. There were a
couple of good sophomore prospects — potential i
named McColl and Cone, Kerkorian and Ilugasian. j
The sports writers wouldn't tliis one. They'd ;
been burned twice too often. Emery Mitchell played ;
that day. (A miracle operation and a knee hrace i
proved the doctors wrong.) At half time Stanford ■
led and it looked like the axe might be coming home. j
But California roared back in the second half. The :
Indian injuries began to pile up. Gordy Rice had hi;, ;
leg broken a lew inches above the ankle. One of Sl.tii- j
ford's sensational touchdowns was called back. And ;
the Bear power house. Rose Bowl bound, defeated
Stanford.
With a few breaks we could have don.' it that
year. Hut iust not quite.
Remember the Big Game of fifty? Cal w;is headed j
for Pasadena again. But it didn't look like ;i Rose J
Bowl team that played Stanford that day in Berkeley.
Or yet again, it might have looked like two Rose Bowl \
teams playing against one another. Because the game
was a tie. (At least that's what the scoreboard said.)
Stanford showed that they were more than "equal"
to California that day. Kerkorian passed one of his
finest games. McColl, the "prospect" who made All- j
American, seemed to catch the passes out of nowhere.
Russ Pomeroy stood like a pillar on defense. Penson,
who was playing his last collegiate game, played his
best one.
And the score was a tie. Hut bring the axe home?
Nearly. Hut just not quite.
And now it's fifty-one. This time it is Stanford
who is headed for the roses. Hut before we go. there
is a little unfinished business to lie taken care of.
There is the matter of an axe which has been just
beyond our reach for a long time.
Hut now it's the year of the "Now Boys."
And Cal will fight hard to retain our axe. Hut will
they keep it? No. Just not quite.

writers weron t too sure. Emery Mitchell was wheeled
into the stadium mid a great ovation. It was his first
day out o) the hospital after a powerful Army team
had nearly torn his knee off. (The doctors said he'd
never play again). That was the year that Rock
Campbell was hurt so badly on the first play of the
game. Ha lay on the field writhing in a convulsion.
When he was taken out in the ambulance, all the men
• tood up und took their hats off.
Cal scored early and many thought that the pre
dicted slaughter was about to begin. But they were
ww>ng. Stanford held. Shaw pass to Rose turned the
tide but the margin ol victory whs a point after touch
down that fell a bit too low.
We nearly won that year. too. But inst not «|iiile.
Keineniber the Big Game of forty-nine? Stanford

had a promising team dial vear. There were a
couple of good sophomore prospects — potential i
named McColl and Cone, Kerkorian and Ilugasian. j
The sports writers wouldn't tliis one. They'd ;
been burned twice too often. Emery Mitchell played ;
that day. (A miracle operation and a knee hrace i
proved the doctors wrong.) At half time Stanford ■
led and it looked like the axe might be coming home. j
But California roared back in the second half. The :
Indian injuries began to pile up. Gordy Rice had hi;, ;
leg broken a lew inches above the ankle. One of Sl.tii- j
ford's sensational touchdowns was called back. And ;
the Bear power house. Rose Bowl bound, defeated
Stanford.
With a few breaks we could have don.' it that
year. Hut iust not quite.
Remember the Big Game of fifty? Cal w;is headed j
for Pasadena again. But it didn't look like ;i Rose J
Bowl team that played Stanford that day in Berkeley.
Or yet again, it might have looked like two Rose Bowl \
teams playing against one another. Because the game
was a tie. (At least that's what the scoreboard said.)
Stanford showed that they were more than "equal"
to California that day. Kerkorian passed one of his
finest games. McColl, the "prospect" who made All- j
American, seemed to catch the passes out of nowhere.
Russ Pomeroy stood like a pillar on defense. Penson,
who was playing his last collegiate game, played his
best one.
And the score was a tie. Hut bring the axe home?
Nearly. Hut just not quite.
And now it's fifty-one. This time it is Stanford
who is headed for the roses. Hut before we go. there
is a little unfinished business to lie taken care of.
There is the matter of an axe which has been just
beyond our reach for a long time.
Hut now it's the year of the "Now Boys."
And Cal will fight hard to retain our axe. Hut will
they keep it? No. Just not quite.

THE AXE
Remember the Big Game of forty-seven? They took
the axe eway but not without a battle, by God. Cal
won the game and won the nxe but lost the real victory
that day. Because a bunch of men, the Andersons
and Fixes, the Quists juid McKitricks, didn't seem to
know the odds and wouldn't quit. T ' h " Rear

came down to Palo Alto for an
afternoon's diversion and nearly
lost his golden hide. And but for
a wobbly pass and a tackle missed,
and two minutes and fifty-eight
seconds, we would have won.
And the student body erected a
plaque in honor of a coach and
team that had lost nine games
' But nj ver lost the will to win."
We nearly kept the axe that
,\ejir. Hut just not quite.
