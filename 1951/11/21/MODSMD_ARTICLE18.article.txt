# Raise Ticket Prices
## 
### 
Letter to the Editor:
Tuition at Stanford is roughly twice what it was
20 years ago. Beefsteak costs much more than twice
what it did 20 years ago. There i.-. twice as much money
in circulation as 20 years ago. On the average, wages
are - over twite those of two docades ago. But the price
of Big f»ame tickets is about the same jls 20 years ago.
The need i.s present for more athletic funds and for

almost every sport. Can anyone name a single spot
which should have less funds or a single coach who
should have less pay? In fact, if we fail to raise pay, !
right down the line, we are in danger of losing good j
men.
If the price of Big Game tickets were increased C'al
would bear about 65'i of the cost while we got 50' v
of the revenue. So why not increase the price of Big
Game tickets to $10 and put our athletic department
on a sound basis?
