# Oski to Burn on Frosh Funeral Pyre
## Bonfire Burning Sparks Farm's Big Game Fever 
### BARNEY GLASER 
Indian hopes soar to the sky as
once again the Big Game bonfire,
backed up by 53 years of tradition,
will burn tomorrow to symbolize
the cremation of the Cal team on
the gridiron.
The night before the Big Game
in 1898 the girls in Roble Hall gath
ered in the front parlor for a vigor
ous demonstration in anticipation of
the coming contest. They left the
parlor to find more people to join
in the yells and songs, as well as to
find a larger place to hold their
rally.
Zete Bonfire
The problem was solved when the
girls saw some Zetes throwing bar
rels on a bonfire. Cheering resumed
as they all encircled the fire. And
so the seed for one of Stanford's
greatest traditions was sown.
The regular procedure of having
a rally in Assembly Hall and ser
pentining behind the band to the
baseball field or Inner Quad and
around the bonfire began in 1899.
By 1907 the Stanford Family con
sidered it an established tradition.
Stanford rooters of 1924 saw the
tallest funeral pyre yet to be built
by the frosh. It was 79 feet high
with a bear's coffin on top.
Fourth Premature Burning
The premature burning of the
pyre, started by a bomb in 1928,
was the fourth successful attempt
made by the enemy in spite of the
usual heavy guard. At 10 in the
morning when the word was passed
that the fire had been sabotaged,
students and faculty alike rushed

from classes to the blaze.
Someone yelled, "Let's rebuild it."
The crowd shouted its approval and
the search for wood followed. Al
though the president couldn't call a
University holiday, all the depart
ment heads hinted that universal
cutting was in order.
With the help of the Southern
Pacific, Palo Alto business men, and
KPO broadcasts for wood, the fire
was rebuilt in a day under the
guidance of the Stanford engineers.
The other unexpected burnings
were in 1901, 1914, and 1925. Bombs
were dropped by planes in 1920 and
1922, but both tries failed.
A Daily editorial in 1932 suggest
ed the annual bonfire should be dis
continued as the tradition had worn
itself out and people didn't care
about it any more. No definite ac
tion was taken and the fire contin
ued to burn.
Frosh Vote Out Fire
9 But after a hot debate in the En
cina lounge the next year, the frosh
decided by a vote of 4 to 1 to dis
continue the fire, because of its high
cost to the frosh class. No other
group on campus had expressed
willingness to help finance it. But a
few men from Sequoia Hall came
to the rescue. They raised 68 cents,
built a small fire, and kept the tra
dition alive.
The "Immortal 21" who had
stolen the axe back from Cal made
the 1933 rally the biggest in years.
But the axe did not. appear until
1935 when it was brought to the
Pavilion under the careful guard
of the Cardinals.
In 1936 eager rooters packed into
the Pavilion to cheer and to see the
notorious Doodles Weaver, who
spewed gold fish all over the stage.
Right after the rally everyone
rushed to Lake Lag where the fu
neral pyre had been placed for the
first time. Once again the fire had
been saved from a premature burn
ing when a freshman discovered a
time bomb planted by two Cal men
who mixed in with the workers.
Certified Bonfire
The first "certified" bonfire was
constructed in 1939. A special com
mittee inspected every piece of
wood to see whether or not it was
stolen. This move was to protect
Stanford from a law suit.
The war years saw no Big Game
fires since the Red Machine was in
the garage from 1942 to 1945, but
the tradition was resumed for the
1946 game.
Oskie was burned in effigy on
top of a record 85-foot pyre in 1948.
In 1949 a system of walkie-talkies
with a sending and receiving set in
Encina was initiated to guard the
bonfire.
In spite of a rain storm which put
a few feet of water in Lake Lagu
nita, the '50 funeral pyre was still
ignited on schedule to the cheers of
a large crowd.
And once more Stanford rooters
will assemble from near and far to
see the traditional Big Game bon
fire, whose flames will lick the sky
after the rally tomorrow.
