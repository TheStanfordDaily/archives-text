# Rain-Drenched Frosh Stack Tall Bonfire
## 
### 
Disregarding the muck and mire
farced upon them by the intermit
tent downpours of the past few
days, freshmen labored all last night
in order to insure completion of the
bonfire before its scheduled igni
tion at 8:15 tomorrow night. - The
present, round - the - clock schedule
will be maintained today and to
night.
"All the help we can get will be
appreciated," said Herb Dwight,
chairman of the bonfire committee.
Only a pittance of workers were on
the scene at Lake Lag yesterday
until about 3:30 p.m., when the
crew was swelled to 100, staying at
that number until dinner-time.
Despite the failure of one of the
two generators, the lighting proved
adequate for the some 00 frosh
"builders" who were on location
prepared for an all-night stand at
8. Although there were erratic ap
pearances of '55 women with coffee
yesterday afternoon, a complete
schedule of refreshment shifts has
been worked out for today.
At 9 last night wood had been
piled about half of the way up the
45-foot telephone poles sunk in the
lake bed as support frames. Even
tual goal of the workers is a lop 15
feet higher than the top of the pres
ent poles.
An incident reminiscent of last
year's Army game occurred Mon
day night when two car.s bogged
down in the slime of the lake bed
and had to be dragged out by
trucks.
