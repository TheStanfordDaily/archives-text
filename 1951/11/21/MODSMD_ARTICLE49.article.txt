# Axe Helps Scalp Axis In 'Different' Big Game
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
This is about a different kind
of Big Game. A Big Gome with
out a football, without a turf,
without a stadium.
The story behind this Big Game
starts on Jan. 16, 1944, when Stan
ford was part of a country at war.
Cal challenged Stanford to ;i con
test— with the Axe, then in the
Cardinals' possession, as the prize.
But the "Big Game" they suggested
was a War Bond contest.
Stanford liked the idea of the
contest, but not the idea of putting
the Axe—their Axe—on the auc
tion block. "The Axe is an athletic
trophy and should remain such,"
The Daily editorialized.
Campanile Suggested
Some people felt involving the
trophy in a contest of relative pur
chasing power would cheapen it as
a symbol of sportsmanship. But
even more prevalent was th(^ t atti
tude, "What, has Cal got to lose?
We're offering the Axe; what have
they to offer?" "Four Sophomore
Women" wrote The Daily .suggest
ing, "Why don't we use the Cam
panile as the prize?"
After an evening's tussle Kxconi
approved the War Bond and Stamp
contest. But they turned thumbs
down on using the Axe. Instead,
the winning school was to receive
the opponent's banner.
According to the rules, Ihe drive

whs to be on h proportional basis to
allow for the differences in enroll
ment. The money from the contest,
the schools agreed, would go for a
$1 r55,000 Billy Mitchell 25 bomber.
On the plane would be a dedicatory
panel "stating that the Universities
of Stanford and California have
sponsored the plane to fight their
common enemy, the Axis."
Then the fireworks started. Aim
in:' toward the highest per capita
sales, each school planned rallies,
dances, labor drives.
Stanford led with six times Cal's
sales after the first day. Two days
before the drive ended, the Indians
were still ahead. Then the blow fell.
Cal students had saved their pur
chases for a last-minute surge to
ward victory. The day before the
drive ended, the Bears were well in
the lead. And Stanford was mar
shaling its forces for a counter
attack.
Axe Stolen
Bui a final complication was yet
to come. With only one day to go—
The Axe was stolen from its rest
ing place in the Cellar.
Stunned and bitter, the Stanford
campus was still trying to decidc
what to do, when Ibe relic was mys
teriously returned. And when the
excitement was over, it was an
nounced that Stanford had won the
contest. In the last day's sales, the
Cards had outdistanced their foes
and Cal had fallen $153,000 short
of winning by proportional rating-
Between them, the two schools
had sold $370,000 worth of bonds,
enough to buy two bombers.
So "Big Game," 1944, was over,
with Stanford the happy victor. The
final score: Stanford $180,000, Cali
i lornia $194,912.
