# Big Game Gaieties Open for 31st Year
## Hilarious Russian Sketch Scores With Reviewer 
### DICK FREDELL 
Tho Big GaineGaieties
opened last night in Memorial
Auditorium and we walked out
- but not because we wanted to.
Unfortunately, even The Daily
lias deadlines to be met, and the
show was still running strong at
j < :30.
We would like to have stayed.
Because the Gaieties this year is
full of bright sketches, diverting
songs, and clever tricks. If, like
all revues, it has a low point now
and then, il more than makes up for
112 - :m with a very fair share of high
points.
Take, for example, "Gone With
the Windski." This is Ham's Head's
version of the Margaret Mitchell
classic as it might have been writ
ten by Tolstoi. The result is quite
hilarious. Not only docs the Colo
r'l (Morgan Stock) drink borscht
juleps out of Dixie cups, but Scar
lett (Anne Lawder> tells us that
she'll "never be a Red 'cause I'm
blue for you."
Then there are two highly enter
taining specialty numbers — Ned
Hutchinson's superb satirical im
-1 jssion oi a movie cowboy, "Back
in ihe Saddle," and Leon Perry's
amusing imitations and small talk.
The music as much of it as we
heard -is nicely arranged and or

chestratcd. The love ballads, to be
sure, arc a bit derivative both as to
lyric and tunc, but Dick Bare's "The
Show's the Thing"' proves a fast,
peppy opener and"The Big Game's
Coming" brings the first-act curtain
down in just the proper Big Game
spirit.
For spirit, after all, is what counts
(his week. The Gaieties are in
tended to heighten Big Game fever,
and in this they succeed. If the
team shows half the spirit on the
field next Saturday that the Gaie
ties cast shows on the stage, Cal
doesn't stand a chance.
