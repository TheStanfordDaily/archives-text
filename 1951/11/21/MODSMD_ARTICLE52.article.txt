### GLORIA BRECKENRIDGE 
Weeks of rehearsals, able directing,
clever writing and good music all go
i /lo making the Big Game Gaieties
something to look forward to.
The first production was back in
18(18 when the campus was excited
over the Rugby game with Cal. "At
Gay Coney Island" was the title of
the show, and the cast weren't the
only ones who wore costumes. Men
i , the audience featured their Car
dinal Crusher hats, priced at $1.
"Coney Island girls, complete with
ankle length skirts were in the
audience, too. As the years passed,
skirt lengths shortened, and the
Gaieties girls came into the picture.
As the director of the '47 show as
red his audience: "Of course we
don't want to exploit, sex, but the
show will have a lot of chorus girls
performing during appropriate mo
ments."
"60 Giddy Girls —Count 'Em— 60"
were a big hit in the 1029 show. That
was the show that boasted a cast of
/ 929, including the ushers. A new
lootball song, "Flaming Red" was
also introduced.
In the '36 Gaieties, Doodles Weaver
and the I'i Phi Quartet introduced a
song that is still in some Farm song
books "Stanford in Spring."
"The Man Who Came to Sunday
Night Supper on Friday Night When
ney Weren't Serving It" was a high
light of the 1940 Gaieties.
In these later years audiences be
came more sedate, and editorials like
the 1911 Daily wrote were no longer
necessary. That year an editorial
writer pleaded: "We wish to appeal
that the Football Show not be inter
' red with in any way."

The incident that The Daily had in
mind was a show given the previous
spring when a group of seniors en
tertained themselves uproariously in
the front row.
During the war years, the show was
produced and directed almost entirely
by women students. Profits from the
1943 show, "At Ease" went to War
Bonds.
The Gaieties missed one year, but
by 1945 it was hack with a Navy
theme: "How the Navy Ought to Be."
'49 Gaieties introduced songs by
Wally White, including "Roll You
Big Red Machine." This show also
featured "Dad Rango" broadcasting
from Baja California with pertinent
advice to the home folks.

Weeks of rehearsals, able directing,
clever writing and good music all go
i /lo making the Big Game Gaieties
something to look forward to.
The first production was back in
18(18 when the campus was excited
over the Rugby game with Cal. "At
Gay Coney Island" was the title of
the show, and the cast weren't the
only ones who wore costumes. Men
i , the audience featured their Car
dinal Crusher hats, priced at $1.
"Coney Island girls, complete with
ankle length skirts were in the
audience, too. As the years passed,
skirt lengths shortened, and the
Gaieties girls came into the picture.
As the director of the '47 show as
red his audience: "Of course we
don't want to exploit, sex, but the
show will have a lot of chorus girls
performing during appropriate mo
ments."
"60 Giddy Girls —Count 'Em— 60"
were a big hit in the 1029 show. That
was the show that boasted a cast of
/ 929, including the ushers. A new
lootball song, "Flaming Red" was
also introduced.
In the '36 Gaieties, Doodles Weaver
and the I'i Phi Quartet introduced a
song that is still in some Farm song
books "Stanford in Spring."
"The Man Who Came to Sunday
Night Supper on Friday Night When
ney Weren't Serving It" was a high
light of the 1940 Gaieties.
In these later years audiences be
came more sedate, and editorials like
the 1911 Daily wrote were no longer
necessary. That year an editorial
writer pleaded: "We wish to appeal
that the Football Show not be inter
' red with in any way."

The incident that The Daily had in
mind was a show given the previous
spring when a group of seniors en
tertained themselves uproariously in
the front row.
During the war years, the show was
produced and directed almost entirely
by women students. Profits from the
1943 show, "At Ease" went to War
Bonds.
The Gaieties missed one year, but
by 1945 it was hack with a Navy
theme: "How the Navy Ought to Be."
'49 Gaieties introduced songs by
Wally White, including "Roll You
Big Red Machine." This show also
featured "Dad Rango" broadcasting
from Baja California with pertinent
advice to the home folks.
