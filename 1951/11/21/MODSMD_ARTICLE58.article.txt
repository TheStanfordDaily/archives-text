# COMPARATIVE SCORES
## Cards 2 Touchdown Favorites 
### LARRY CAHN 
If comparative scores mean any
j thing, and they usually don't, Stan
lord rates about a two to three touch
down edge over the Calilornia Bears
when the two teams meet Saturday
in the Stadium.
Each team has played six confer
! ence tilts and three that don't count
in the PCC standings. In all the In
j dians and Bears have battled seven
! common l'ocs, with Stanford winning
i all seven, whil? the Berkeley boys
were dropping two.
Cji! Infer eetionals In'nressive
But for a moment lei's look i t the
non-conference gjynes. California
has played two intersectionals, Penn
sylvania and Minnesota. And C.li-
I fornia looked impressive white
j washing the Quakers, 35 to 0 and
| routing the Gophers, sf> to 14. Stun
i fordâ€žha:; only had one intersectional.
! that being played and won against
j a Big Ten power, Michigan.

Both schools have played Santa
Clara and here is where Cal gets their
biggest and perhaps only edee. The
bears trounced the Broncos in their
season opener to the tune of 34 to 0. i
Stanford on the other hand, just did
nip the Prune Belt boys, 21 to 14, as
the Broncos were once again ex
tremely high for the neighborhood
struggle.
Car:'s Better in PCC Play
Getting down to the business sid->
of the schedule, Stanford h: s gained
her biggest comparative margin in
Conference games. The Cards who
opened weakly against Oregon, and
survived 27 to 20 still did better than
the Bears who were kicked home 28
to ;<(i relying on the toe of Les Kichter
for the margin of victory.
Agiinst UCLA. Stanford looked
good, and racked the boy.s in powder
blue, 21 to 7. But when the Bears
travelled to the Coliseum the Bruins
turned the tables on their northern

cousins and registered a 21 to 7 win.
Chalk up a four tesdee Stanford ad
vantage.
Next on the Card sked was the
| Washington go. Stanford, playing on
i the unfriendly Seattle turf, edged
i the Huskies 14 to 7 in a game in which
! mistakes cost the Cards dearly. And
I when the Huskies came to Berkeley
j town ten days back, McElhenny and
! Co. almost turned the trick, but again
i Richter rnd a Held coal, saved the
day and the Bears, 37 to 28.
The Washington State game is an
important comparative game. For it
was in this game that the Cards
.stopped the Cougars cold while scor
ing almost at will. Final score was
i Stanford 21, WSC 13; both Cougar
j tallies coming through Chuck Tay
-1 lor's generosity. But the Bears
played see-saw, emerging eventual
42 to 35 victors. The Cougars scored
freely on the Bears and in contrast
I could not do so at Palo Alto. Of
i course the Bears scored pretty much
! when they so desired also.
USC Game Important
The USC game might be the story
teller. Invading the Berkeley Bowl,
a month back, the Trojans stunned a
football nation by ending California's
winning streak with a 21 to 14 tri
umph. Then it was Stanford's turn,
and they likewise stunned the nation
| with a thrilling 27 to 20 win over SC
in the Friendly Coliseum,
j Finally the Oregon State game.
| Well, both Stanford and California
dammed the Beavers by an identical,
35 to 14 score, so this result tells us
nothing.
