Every year the so-called experts I
pick the winner of the Big Came, i
Usually their prognostications mean I
nothing, but people enjoy reading
them. The Big Came has a habit
of spoiling more picker averages !
than any other game, but here they j
are anyway:
BILL LEISER, sports e 'itor of the j
Chronicle: Stanford by three touch
downs. A gradually strengthened
defense will give the offense more
time to work the Kerkorian to Mc-
Coll .which of course is a pass to '
McColl or seven other men.
CURLY GRIEVE, sports editor of
the Examiner: Stanford by one
touchdown. They're not going to j
stop Stanford now. They've got
great spirit and a fine team.
ART ROKENBAUiVI, Chronicle
columnist: Stanford, 35 to 33. Ev
eryone is asking, 'ilow good is J
Stanford?" They are just good
enough to beat Cal.
BUII SPENCEH, sports editor ol
t! e San Francisco News: Stanford,
21 to 13. I've been sticking with
them all sea .on, and I can't quit i
now.
iVIARV EISENBERG, Call-Bulle
tin scribe: Stanford will wax 'em, I
but good.
ROGER WILLIAMS, News writ
er: Stanford, 28 to 14. I'll have to
stick with Taylor and his gang.
PRESCOTT SULLIVAN, Examin
er columnist: Stanford by one
touchdown. No one is going to stop
the Indians now. They want to go
to the Rose Bowl undefeated, and
they have great 'spirit.
ART JOHNSON, Chronicle writ
er: Stanford by all that it takes
to win . . . which is one point.
Thirteen-point odds in a game such
as this are ridiculous.
DINK TEMPLETON, radio broad
ca ter and. sports columnist: Stan
lord by three touchdowns, because
ihey have some of the best football
players ever as:.em l.led on one
Coast team . . . McColl, Kerkorian,
Math i a s , Manoogian, Broderick,
Vick, Rye, etc. They're all great
competitors, and you can't beat a
good competitor.
