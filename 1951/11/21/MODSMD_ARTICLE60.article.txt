freshmen on the starting offensive

and defensive teams and 1G Ram
blers have played in varsity compe
tition for the Bears thi.s year. Out
standing among those Ramblers
who will lace the Braves tomorrow
are tht- following:
Probably one of the brightest
prospects is Paul Idirsen, a fresh
man wlui was very wu'ely sought
after this year. Paul starred for
Tinlocl. High last year. His most
out landing performance this year
came in the Minnesota game when

he raced 72 vards from scrimmage
for the Beai*s' seventh touchdown
in the game.
Eob Worrell and Frank Tinkham
two 215-pound tacklvs who starrer
lor the Cal last year, will be

on offense for the Ramblers, and
Jim Morton, a L2l) - pounder who
was also a star on hist year's I'rosh,
will start at center.
Brent Ogden will open at quai '
terback, and is the only senior on
the team. He has seen a lot of ac
tion with the varsity both in 19W)
and '5!, and will suit up for the
varsity game altei-ward.
Dean O'llare, a teammate of
Johnny Olszewski at St. Anthon>
Il : ,'h in Long Beach, has seei>
plenty of action this year and will
start at dtfensve halfback for the
Ramblers. •
Jint Alfano, a sophomore, will
play the other defensive half. Last
year, Jim started for the freshman
team and he has . c een some action
with Pappy Waldorf's varsity thi •
year. Don Marks, a 180-pound soph,
will round out the defensive hack
field for the Ramblers.
The Braves will ielv on the pass
ing arm of quarterback Jack Bickel
