fornia also shows a decided advan
tage. The Bears sre r ceon I in FCC
landings in this department, while
Stanford rates near the bottom of
!he pile. Tne Berkeley boys have
'inly allowed an average of 12R j
yard per gam" through their for
ward wall whil" tho Cud defense j
has given up lt»9 yards per game on i
the ground.
In passing the Cards rate an ad

vantage that might mean the differ
ence in the outcome. Although both
cluhi have gone via thr air for
eight touchdowns, tho Cards have
a vera god 159 aerial yards per
as contrasted to the Bears' 98. Stan
ford's pa sin £ completion percent
age is over . .">OO, a good one hundred
points above t)i«t of California.
But what is more important is
that California, judging from the
record', cannot defen i against aer
ial bombs. While Stanford leads the
PCC in pa 'i defense, the Bears pre
right at the bottom of the ladder,
re ting fecurely in the cellar.
