# Taylor, Youngest Coach In Nation, Leads Top Staff
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
A Stanford student remarked recently, "I wouldn't trade our
coaching staff for any in the nation."
That attitude seems to be typical of the Farm student body, and
especially of those who know Chuck Taylor and the staff and see
them in action.
The coaches do more than turn up for practice for two hours

each day and for the game on Satur
day. They work from eight in the
morning often until the wee hours
ol the night, just preparing for the
next game.
CHUCK TAYLOR, at the age of
31, is .the youngest head coach in
the country. He is also the most suc
cessful. Going into the Oregon State
game, he had won eight straight
games. This, coupled with 15 games
without u loss as head frosh coach,
gave him an undefeated record.
Right now, Chuek Taylor has an in
side track on "coach of the year"
honors. A win against Cal might make
him a cinch for the award.
As a player at Stanford, the 204
pound, red-haired Taylor was a
unanimous choice for All - Coast
guard three years in a row. He was
selected to the All-American team in
his senior year.
Taylor spent three years in the
Navy as a lieutenant and played a
year of professional ball, before join
ing the Stanford staff in 1947.
One of the most able and brilliant
members of the youthful staff is ami
able DUTCH FEHRING. Fehring
played All-American tackle at Pur
due and won nine letters in football,
basketball, and baseball. Ho was
given the award for the outstanding
scholar-athlete at Purdue and was
also named Captain of the All Big
Ten team.
Fehring has coached 10 years at
Purdue, one year at lowa Pre-flight,
one year at UCLA, and helped de
velop the great Oklahoma lines in
1940 and 1947. He holds a master's
degree and is working for his doc
torate.
Fehring's scouting was judged so
brilliant by the 1949 team, that they
awarded him the game ball, when
they everwhehned Southern Cul that
year.
JOE RUETZ (pronounced Ritz) is
responsible for the Indian's offensive
line's sharp blocking. He was an All-
American guard at Notre Dame and
was named to the All-Service All-
American team when he played for

St. Mary's Prefiight during the war.
The well-spoken Ruetz was a sec
ond lieutenant and saw action as a
carrier fighter pilot in the South Pa
cific. In 194 C lie played guard for
the Chicago Rockets and earned a
master's degree at the University of
Chicago.
In 1949, Ruetz returned to St.
Mary's, where he had been line coach
before the war. He served as head
coach until St. Mary's dropped foot
ball last year.
GEORGE LYNN has a right to be
very proud. The defensive backfield
which he has tutored is the best in
the league. Southern California is
reputed to have a good passing attack,
but Lynn's defenders actually inter
cepted more SC passes than USC re
ceivers caught. A football rarity.
Lynn was captain and quarterback
of the great Ohio State team of 1942.
He has coached at Ohio State. Kent
State, and Oklahoma.
PETE KMETOVIC, backfield coach,
was a team-mate of Taylor's on the
1940 Wow Boy's team. The speedy
left half gave the Indians a Rose Bowl
victory against Nebraska by running
back a punt to a touchdown. He
played on the Navy All-Star team in
1945 and two years of pro ball after
he was released from the Navy.
Head Scout MAI, ELWARI) has
had a world of football experience.
He was a teammate of Knute Rockne
at Notre Dame and played end.
Later he served as head coach and
athletic directdr at Purdue Univer
sity. Elward is known as one of the
best Scouts in the business
The head roster of the Braves squad
is 808 GHILOTTI. Ghilotti guided
last year's frosh team to champion
ship last season. He played end for
the '47-48 teams and is one of the
seven athletes to be named to the
Modesto Junior College's Hall of
Fame.
Assisting Ghilotti are ex - Stan
ford stars JIM CASTAGNOIJ and
TOM SHAW.

CHUCK TAYLOR, at the age of
31, is .the youngest head coach in
the country. He is also the most suc
cessful. Going into the Oregon State
game, he had won eight straight
games. This, coupled with 15 games
without u loss as head frosh coach,
gave him an undefeated record.
Right now, Chuek Taylor has an in
side track on "coach of the year"
honors. A win against Cal might make
him a cinch for the award.
As a player at Stanford, the 204
pound, red-haired Taylor was a
unanimous choice for All - Coast
guard three years in a row. He was
selected to the All-American team in
his senior year.
Taylor spent three years in the
Navy as a lieutenant and played a
year of professional ball, before join
ing the Stanford staff in 1947.
One of the most able and brilliant
members of the youthful staff is ami
able DUTCH FEHRING. Fehring
played All-American tackle at Pur
due and won nine letters in football,
basketball, and baseball. Ho was
given the award for the outstanding
scholar-athlete at Purdue and was
also named Captain of the All Big
Ten team.
Fehring has coached 10 years at
Purdue, one year at lowa Pre-flight,
one year at UCLA, and helped de
velop the great Oklahoma lines in
1940 and 1947. He holds a master's
degree and is working for his doc
torate.
Fehring's scouting was judged so
brilliant by the 1949 team, that they
awarded him the game ball, when
they everwhehned Southern Cul that
year.
JOE RUETZ (pronounced Ritz) is
responsible for the Indian's offensive
line's sharp blocking. He was an All-
American guard at Notre Dame and
was named to the All-Service All-
American team when he played for

St. Mary's Prefiight during the war.
The well-spoken Ruetz was a sec
ond lieutenant and saw action as a

Chicago.
In 1949, Ruetz returned to St.
Mary's, where he had been line coach
before the war. He served as head
coach until St. Mary's dropped foot
ball last year.
GEORGE LYNN has a right to be
very proud. The defensive backfield
which he has tutored is the best in
the league. Southern California is
reputed to have a good passing attack,
but Lynn's defenders actually inter
cepted more SC passes than USC re
ceivers caught. A football rarity.
Lynn was captain and quarterback
of the great Ohio State team of 1942.
He has coached at Ohio State. Kent
State, and Oklahoma.
PETE KMETOVIC, backfield coach,
was a team-mate of Taylor's on the

athletic directdr at Purdue Univer
sity. Elward is known as one of the
best Scouts in the business
The head roster of the Braves squad

last year's frosh team to champion
ship last season. He played end for
the '47-48 teams and is one of the
seven athletes to be named to the
Modesto Junior College's Hall of
Fame.
Assisting Ghilotti are ex - Stan
ford stars JIM CASTAGNOIJ and
TOM SHAW.
A Stanford student remarked recently, "I wouldn't trade our
coaching staff for any in the nation."
That attitude seems to be typical of the Farm student body, and
especially of those who know Chuck Taylor and the staff and see
them in action.
