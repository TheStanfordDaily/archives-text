# Bear Coaching Crew Boasts Good Record
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
California s coaching staff has compiled an impressive record.
The rotund Pappy Waldorf and his troop of assistants have guided
the Bears to 46 wins against six defeats in four and nine-tenths
years. A Waldorf-coached team has never lost to Stanford, but
then a Chuck-Taylor-coached team has never lost to Cal.

Here is a run-down on the Cal
coaching staff.
LYNN WALDORF played guard
at Amherst, but he was not an out
standing player. He was head coach
at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma A&M,
and Kansas State where he piloted
his teams to 54 wins and 17 losses.
In 1935, he went to Northwestern
where he remained for 11 years.
At Northwestern, his teams won
49 and lost 45 while playing through
suicide schedules. For instance, in
1941. the Wildcats lost only to Min
nesota, 8 to 7; Michigan, 34 to 7; and
Notre Dame, 7 to (5. Minnesota,
Notre Dame, and Michigan were
first, second, and fourth in the na
tion that year. In addition, the
Wildcats handed twelfth-place Ohio
State their lone set-back.
A Waldorf-coached team is al
ways strong on fundamentals and
devoid of trickery. As always, this
year's Cal crew features quick
openers and hectic end sweeps with
everybody from the quarterback to
Oskio out in front of the ball car
rier. Cal's passing is. as usual, a
joke and is used solely as a change
of-pace to keep the defense spread
out.
Waldorf was voted the coach of
the year in 1935, and took second in
1949 when he amazed all by pro
ducing an undefeated team after
losing Jackie Jensen to the diamond
wal's and two great backs, Jack
Swaner and Charlie Sarver, through
injuries.
WhS FRY lias been Waldorf's
backfield coach since 1940. He was a
good back at lowa and played in
the 1926 Shrine game. 'Hie backs
that Fry turns out are generally
big men who block well and dun't
fumble. Speed and trickiness have
little place in the Cal offense. It is
interesting to note that Johnny
Pappa and Paul Larson, two fast
and tricky runners who average
well over seven yards j>er carry, see
little' action because of their lack
of blocking ability.
HERM MUSTEK took over line
coaching duties after the death of
Bob Testier, the former coach. He

( was All-Coast tackle at St. Mary's.
I This year lus offensive line has been
| very powerful in every game ex
j cept the UCLA debacle, while CalV
j defensive line has proved surpris-
I ingly porous.
EGGS MANSKE took over as end
coach and scout after retiring lrom
i the pro football ranks. Cal's ends
| are hard to distinguish from other
linemen. They're generally good
i blockers and terrible pass catchers.
! Last year no end caught over six
passes, although this year Dave
1 Hood should end up with about 20
; catches for a new Bear record.
! Eggs scouts Stanford and once
■ stated that he considered the Card
1 backfield of Kerkorian, Hugasian,
White, and De Young better than
; the 1941 Chicago Bear backfield of
Ludkman, Gallarneau, Standlee,
j and McAfee. Eggs is a character.
MBS PRICE, ZEB CHANEY, and
IIAKOLO GANT round out tlie
I coaching staff. They scout and
! coach the Ramblers and explain
Pappy's jokes and supply him with
crying towels. All in all, it's a tine
coaching staff. The assistants teach
good fundamental football, while
Pappy organizes and classifies the
I hordes of candidates and scours the
i countryside for new talent.

his teams to 54 wins and 17 losses.
In 1935, he went to Northwestern
where he remained for 11 years.
At Northwestern, his teams won
49 and lost 45 while playing through
suicide schedules. For instance, in
1941. the Wildcats lost only to Min
nesota, 8 to 7; Michigan, 34 to 7; and
Notre Dame, 7 to (5. Minnesota,
Notre Dame, and Michigan were
first, second, and fourth in the na
tion that year. In addition, the
Wildcats handed twelfth-place Ohio
State their lone set-back.
A Waldorf-coached team is al
ways strong on fundamentals and
devoid of trickery. As always, this
year's Cal crew features quick
openers and hectic end sweeps with
everybody from the quarterback to
Oskio out in front of the ball car
rier. Cal's passing is. as usual, a
joke and is used solely as a change
of-pace to keep the defense spread
out.
Waldorf was voted the coach of
the year in 1935, and took second in
1949 when he amazed all by pro
ducing an undefeated team after
losing Jackie Jensen to the diamond
wal's and two great backs, Jack
Swaner and Charlie Sarver, through
injuries.
WhS FRY lias been Waldorf's
backfield coach since 1940. He was a
good back at lowa and played in
the 1926 Shrine game. 'Hie backs
that Fry turns out are generally
big men who block well and dun't
fumble. Speed and trickiness have
little place in the Cal offense. It is
interesting to note that Johnny
Pappa and Paul Larson, two fast
and tricky runners who average
well over seven yards j>er carry, see
little' action because of their lack
of blocking ability.
