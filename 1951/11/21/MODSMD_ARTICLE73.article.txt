# Press Box Busy Place

### DICK MALTZMAN 
As the tremendous Big Game
crowd surges to its feet with the
opening kickoff, high above the
south side of Stanford Stadium sev
eral score newsmen, photographers,
scout*;, spotters, statisticians, and
observers will have already com
menced their afternoon's work in
the press box.
As the reporters begin to type out
the reports of the game, as the
movie and television cameras begin
to crank up, the spotters to call
players to the radio and PA an
nouncers, and the statisticians to
record their data on the plays, they
will all be using a multitude of
services provided for them by Di
rector of Athletic Information Don
Liebendorfer.
Four phone lines—one for each
coaches' bench, one for the PA, and
one for the press, will be in use, and
upward of 15 wire machines will be
clicking away, sending up-to-date
reports on the game to the major
wire services, to all the big Bay
Area dailies, and to other leading
news sheets.
There will be several chaps whose
view ol the game will be limited to
noting and recording the statistics,
Loth individual and team, of each
and every play. At half-time and
again at the end of the game these
records are quickly compiled into
reports of statistics and of the play
by-play, which are mimeographed
and distributed to members of the
press box faculty within minutes
after the actual action has ended.
Ali these services are taken vir
tually for granted by their users,
as they are to be found in varying
quality in almost every major press
box in the nation; nevertheless, Lie
bendorfer has devoted much time
and effort to seeing they are pro
vided and that they function so
smoothly.
In addition to arranging for the
actual physical faciliteis in the box,
probably Liebendorfer's greatest
task is allocating the limited num
ber of tickets to the men who will
actually sit there.
