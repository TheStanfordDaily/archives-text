# Outlook for '52 Varsity Is Bright Down on Farm
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Six freshmen have seen varsity
action this year and are very likely
to greatly help determine Stan
lord's football outlook for the com
ing season. Under the present eli
gibility rules freshmen are able to
enter into varsity competition. Al
though most of the '55ers have been
playing on the Braves, these are the
six men who have already made the
grade.
The most outstanding of the
freshmen already on the varsity is
Don Sanders. Although Don came !

to Stanford originally as an offen
sive halfback, Coach Chuck Taylor
shilted him to the safety position,
where he has proved invaluable all
season. An excellent pass defender,
Don can move up to a linebacker
spot to stop the running.
Dave Castellucci, second - string
defensive half, will also be counted
on heavily next year. Currently
playing behind Dick Horn, Dave has
seen considerable action this year.
Hoy Krickeberg, a third-quarter
freshman from San Jose, has shown
that he can also be counted on
heavily next year. Last spring, in
the final spring practice scrimmage,
Roy turned in a beautiful game at
defensive middle-guard. He is 5 ft.
11 and weighs 210.
Another freshman who was here
last spring is John Ludeke, a 211-
lb., (i—ft. 1 tackle from Oakland.
Ludeke did outstanding work in last
year's spring practice and will help
the varsity considerably next year.
Two freshmen recently brought
up from the Braves are Matt Armi
tuge and Win Wedge. Armitage, a
205-1 b., 6-ft. 1 guard, has done out
standing work for the Braves all
season and has shown quite a bit
in the times he has been in varsity
competition. Wedge, who stands 5
ft. 10 and w?ighs 204, is one of the
most imprc. ved players on the
squad. Brought up from the Braves
at mid-season, he has played in
four var ity contests. He made the
trip to USC with the varsity and
saw quite a bit of action against
the Trojans.
Junior Varsity Coach Bob Chilot
ti, when asked to name a starting
team among freshmen alone, chose
the followin \\
Off.ensive ends would be John
Robcrg and Jack Rannels. Roberg
would also ;:!ay defense along with
Kay Smith.
I.udeke at I Paul Revak would be
•he tacklos. Both bovs are capable
of going bot i ways.
Three mm who have already
made the va.-.-ity would fill in at the
guard spots. Win Wedge would an
chor down one guard, poing both
ways, and the other position would
see Roy Krickeberg on offense and
Matt Armitage on defense.
Dirk lYlunn would be the offen
sive center and Jerry (ioldherg,
Herb West, and Manny Vanderlip
would all be first-string lineback
ers.
Quarterback would be Dave Cas
k!iiM<i; offensive halves, Don San
ders and Bill Rogers; and the full -
back would be Mike Anderson. On
defense-, Castellucci and Ron Niinn
would be the halves and Sanders
would be the safety man.
