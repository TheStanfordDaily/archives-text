# The 						Sporting Thing

### RON FIMRITE Sports Editor, Daily Californian 
It now most certainly appears that, as Stanford and California prepare
for their 54th Big Game, the shoe (as so many people say) is securely on
the other foot.
For the first time in many autumns, California will go into this contest
as the low man on the tote board as your Indians seem destined for big
things including the Bowl of Roses—out of which we so gracefully stepped.
Yet, though the odds favor the hated Reds, no reasonable person should
count out Pappy Waldorf's group before the first hole is opened.
It's a most unusual situation for Mr. Waldorf to bring a team into
this game with a record anything but unblemished, but this season's
Bears have been upended by both the nasty sons of Troy and their
Westwood neighbors. But, in spite <>112 the.->e two mishaps, they can be
a cantankerous sort when they want to, and they want to dearly this
week.
The Bears this year have suffered all sorts of physical inconveniences.
Seldom has Waldorf had an injury problem the likes of what he has had
these past few months. Nearly every Bear of any importance has been
laid off, at one time or another, with injuries and illnesses ranging from
cracked clavicles to mononucleosis. Only some remarkable recoveries
have saved Waldorf and staff from further embarrassment.
One person who may or may not recover in time for the Big Game
is John Olszewski, a truly brilliant running back and the Bears' offensive
spark before his knee got damaged in the SC game. Mr. "O" got back
momentarily in the Washington game but re-injured his shaky gam after
a 51-yard gallop. How much, if anything, he can do against you people
is a question decidedly moot.
When all hands are safely on deck and breathing freely, Mr. W has
a nice hunch to work with. There are some talented football men on
this squad such as Les Richtcr (of whom you may have heard), Ozzie
Harris (the most publicized unsung hero in all of football), Dick Lem-
Mon, Ralph Krueger and Boh Karpe, Billy Mais and a harmonious
halfback quartet consisting of Don Rohison, Harry West, Biil Powell,
and Johnny Pappa.
These four backs complement each other perfectly. Kobison is the
heavy duty man, the best driver on the squad with Olszewski absent, the
best blocker with Olszewski absent, and a very accurate punter; Powell
is a speedster who ran 98 yards against Oregon State for a new PCC
record; West is a real break-away threat with a swift and pretty change
of pace; Pappa is the spot runner, inserted when the chances are good
lot a long scoring play. Together they form a consistent threat to the
enemy's defensive barriers.
One of the really pleasant surprises of this season has been the steady
play of Billy Mais at quarterback. Mais is not a natural passer and is
additionally handicapped by an innate slowness of loot, but he squeezes
the most out of his physical equipment, and has developed into an excel
lent ball handler. Mais' remarkable faking has allowed him to take the
time he needs to throw and often allows his receivers to slip by deceived
halfbacks into the open plains.
The fullback chores, if Olszewski cannot do the job with his customary
gusto, will probably fall to either Don Johnson or sophomore Bonnie
Harris. Johnson is the bigger threat. He has speed and, as a converted
quarterback, is a dangerous passer on the old Jackie Jensen fullback pass
play (remember it?). Harris is a good blocker and he runs wtih honest
ferocity.
The California offensive line, if they're all around at game time,
stacks (or piles) up with any in the conference. It is anchored by
large tackles. Bob Karpe and Ralph Krueger, center Harris, and the
omnipotent Richter. Large Les may be the finest lineman this school
has ever developed. His linebacking ability is beyond reproach, and as
an offeiissve rv*ht guard, few block so cleanly and so conclusively. Also,
he's an added threat in a pinch with his accurate placekicking.
The defensive line is not nearly so solid. Here the casualty list is high
est. Glenn Gulvin's knee injury leaves another hole in the defenses. At
tackle any one of a number of men, including Don Curran, Keith Meserve,
Dwight Ely, Tom F.ieger, and John Miksits, could see considerable action.
At end, the combination may be Ed Bartlett and George Pelonis or Bart
lett and Paul Andrew. All do an adequate job. The often thankless post
of guard in the line usually falls to competent Steve Glick.
Backing up this not so stone wall are Richter, John Cadenasso, and Hal
Norris, the star shot putter of last semester's lrosh track team. At times
they are a formidable trio. Richter has given some beautiful Horatio-at
the bridge performances. His replacement Ls Pete Mering, who can and
does do an occasional stint at tackle.
In the secondary, Dick LemMon is the standout. An angry tackier, he
has been nominated for All-America honors as a defensive halfback. At
the other half will be either Sam Williams or Dick Lee, depending upon
Williams' wounded knee.
Safety may prove to be an interesting if not perplexing problem.
The two alternating incumbents, Ray Willsey and John Peterson, are
neither above 5 ft. !) in. tall, whereas your Mr. McColl. from the reports
we've read, can't be a fraction under 7 ft. Whether Waldovf will go
with Willsey and Peterson or someone a bit mare longitudinal is an
cther of those moot questions. Rumors circulating about have had
everyone but Waldorf himself at the post.
At any rate, upon these men will depend California's changes for the
sweetest Big Game triumph since '41. If enough of them can climb out of
t!ie'r hospital beds in time, the odds that are so strangely stacked against
them may be beaten.
Maybe they'll be better underdogs than they've been favorites in the
past few seasons. That would make a great many people happy—outside
Palo Alto.
