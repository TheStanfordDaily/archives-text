# Co-Captains Play finale
## 
### 
Three Indian seniors who will be
playing their last game in Stanford
Stadium Saturday have been elect
ed to positions of unusual honor and
responsibility by their teammates.
Co - captains Bill McColl, Gary
Kerkorian, and Jess Cone not only
have won high regard for their
straight football playing, but are
also looked to for official decisions
on the field and as a sort of bul
wark of that great spirit which has
been in a large way responsible for
the Cards' success this season.
Now in his third year as a starter
on the Card varsity, All-American
McColl has been enjoying his
greatest season. For the first time
able to concentrate entirely on ef
fense, Big Bill has led the PCC al
most from wire to wire in pass re
ceiving.
Utilizing his tremendous physical
ability and keen mind, McColl
keeps the pressure on a defense all
the time with his great blocking,
faking, and ability to catch any
thing that is thrown to him.
Gary Kerkorian, quarterback and
sparkplug, has been unquestionably
more consistently dangerous this
year than ever before.
Always an excellent passer, Ker
korian has at times in the past been
troubled by streaks when nothing
seemed to go right, such as in the
UCLA game of last ye-ir.
This season, however, Kerkorian
has combined shrewd, confident
play calling with needle-threading
passing and a certain intangible
poise to become one of the best QLi's
in the nation.
Cone, on the other hand, has been
hampered by an injured knee in
this, his third year as starting de
fensive guard. Jess, who displays
tremendous quantities of "will to
win" on the field, really scraps all
the way.
