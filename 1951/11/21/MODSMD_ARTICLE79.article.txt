# Great Contests Mark The 53 Big Games
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
For the first time since 1946,
Stanford will go into the Big Game
in the role of the favorite. The bet
ting odds mean nothing, however,
as the record of past Indian-Bear
battles proves.
The Stanford-Cal series, one of
the closest of major grid rivalries,
is also the closest in the way of
games won. To date, the Cards have
won 23 games, Cal 21, and nine have
been ties. Cal has 601 total points,
however, to Stanford's 579.
The whole thing started back in
1891 when a group of Stanford
students, led by Herbert Hoover,
challenged Cal to a game. The
auair took place the following
spring and Stanford, heavy un
derdogs, beat the Bears 14-10.
Three years later, Cal nabbed
their first victory as they eked
out a 6-0 win.
Rugby took over in 1905 and
lasted for 15 seasons. Stanford won
most of the games under rugby
rules. Then came the deluge.
Headed by such stalwarts as
Brick Muller, Brodie Stephens, and
Boots Erb, the Bears enjoyed one
of their greatest reigns of prosper
ity. In five seasons from 1919 to
1924 the Bears won 42, lost none,
and tied four. In 1919 Cal beat the
Cards 14-10, 38-0 in 1920, 42-7 in
1921, 28-0 in 1922, and 9-0 in 1923,
Ernie Nevers' first year.
The turning point was 1924, as
many Stanford fans called this one
the greatest of all Big Games.
With 10 minutes to go in the game
and Cal out in front 20-6, Stanford
began to rally. Ted Shipkey made
a phenomenal catch for one Stan
ford score and Murray Cuddeback,
with four seconds left to play, made
another brilliant touchdown catch.
With the game practically over,
Cuddeback booted the tying point.
Ernie Nevers sparked the Cards

to a 27-14 win in 1925, and in 1926
the Rose Bowl - bound Indians,
rated number one nationally,
swamped the Bears 41 -Ci. Dick
Hyland sparked the attack as he
scampered 48 yards for a score
in the first quarter. Four years
later Stanford scored their great
est victory as they trounced the
Bears 41-0.
Stanford was winless in their next
two outings, but in 1933, the first
season of the Vow Boys, a reign of
prosperity hit the Farm. In 1933
the Cards won 7-3. They turned the
trick again in 1934, beating Cal 9-7,
and in 1935 they handed Cal their
only defeat of the season as they
won 13-0. Bobby Grayson and Jim
Coffis each scored a touchdown to
knock off the slightly favored Bears.
The departure of the Vow Boys
saw a famine hit the Farm as Cal
won successive victories in four
straight years. The Bears, spear
headed by Vic Bottari, Sam Chap
man, and Perry Schwartz, beat the
Cards 20-0 in 1936 and 13-0 in 1937.
In 1940 Stanford succeeded in
shocking the football world by
winning ten straight under a new
coach, Clark Shaughnessy, and
the T-formation, then a new sys
tem. Frankie Albert, Stanford's
All-American quarterback, engi
neered the Cards to a 12-7 win
over the Bears. Kmetovic and
Gallarneau scored for Stanford.
The Bears and Cards traded
punches for the next two years as
Cal won 16-0 in 1941 but bowed
to the Cards 26-7 in '42.
In 1946, Stanford muscled out a
25-6 victory. The Cal rooters took
the game a trifle hard as they pro
ceeded to tear up the seats of their
stadium and shrieked for Coach
Frank Wickhorst's scalp. They
marched to Wickhorst's home and
serenaded him and his family with
hoots, catcalls, and other insults.
Cal was made the butt of hundreds
of jokes, but they succeeded in re
placing Wickhorst with Pappy Wal
dorf, one of the greatest of modern
coaches.
Next year saw Stanford rise
up and almost upset (he odds that
had the Bears 10-1 favorites. Cal
won 21-18, a desperation pass
from Jack Jensen to Paul Keck
ley paying off in the last three
minu<es of p'ar. George Quist
was Stanford's hern as he played
an inspired game at linebacker.
In 1948 the Cards almost upset
the odds again, as they bowed to
the Rose Bowl-bound Bears 7-6. In
1949 a flashy but shallow Card team
held the Bears at bay for two and
a half quarters, maintaining a 14-12
half-time lead. Jack Swaner and
Jim Monachino ran wild in the lat
ter half of the game, however, and
the Indians bowed 33-14.
Last year, in another thriller,
Stanford tied the Pasadena-bound
Bears, 7-7. Gary Kerkorian turned
in an inspired performance as he
pleted 17 passes for 212 yards and
Stanford's only touchdown. High
lights of the game were the fine de
fensive playing of Gordy White,
Leon King, Russ Pomeroy, and Bill
McColl. McColl made several sen
sational catches on offense and
threw a pass that traveled 65 yards
in the air but fell incomplete.
For the first time since 1946,
Stanford will go into the Big Game
in the role of the favorite. The bet

scampered 48 yards for a score
in the first quarter. Four years
later Stanford scored their great
est victory as they trounced the
Bears 41-0.
Stanford was winless in their next
two outings, but in 1933, the first
season of the Vow Boys, a reign of
prosperity hit the Farm. In 1933
the Cards won 7-3. They turned the
trick again in 1934, beating Cal 9-7,
and in 1935 they handed Cal their
only defeat of the season as they
won 13-0. Bobby Grayson and Jim
Coffis each scored a touchdown to
knock off the slightly favored Bears.
The departure of the Vow Boys
saw a famine hit the Farm as Cal
won successive victories in four
straight years. The Bears, spear
headed by Vic Bottari, Sam Chap
man, and Perry Schwartz, beat the
Cards 20-0 in 1936 and 13-0 in 1937.
In 1940 Stanford succeeded in
shocking the football world by
winning ten straight under a new
coach, Clark Shaughnessy, and
the T-formation, then a new sys
tem. Frankie Albert, Stanford's
All-American quarterback, engi
neered the Cards to a 12-7 win
over the Bears. Kmetovic and
Gallarneau scored for Stanford.
The Bears and Cards traded
punches for the next two years as
Cal won 16-0 in 1941 but bowed
to the Cards 26-7 in '42.
In 1946, Stanford muscled out a
25-6 victory. The Cal rooters took
the game a trifle hard as they pro
ceeded to tear up the seats of their
stadium and shrieked for Coach
Frank Wickhorst's scalp. They
marched to Wickhorst's home and
serenaded him and his family with
hoots, catcalls, and other insults.
Cal was made the butt of hundreds
of jokes, but they succeeded in re
placing Wickhorst with Pappy Wal
dorf, one of the greatest of modern
coaches.
Next year saw Stanford rise
up and almost upset (he odds that
had the Bears 10-1 favorites. Cal
won 21-18, a desperation pass
from Jack Jensen to Paul Keck
ley paying off in the last three
minu<es of p'ar. George Quist
was Stanford's hern as he played
an inspired game at linebacker.
In 1948 the Cards almost upset
the odds again, as they bowed to
the Rose Bowl-bound Bears 7-6. In
1949 a flashy but shallow Card team
held the Bears at bay for two and
a half quarters, maintaining a 14-12
half-time lead. Jack Swaner and
Jim Monachino ran wild in the lat
ter half of the game, however, and
the Indians bowed 33-14.
Last year, in another thriller,
Stanford tied the Pasadena-bound
Bears, 7-7. Gary Kerkorian turned
in an inspired performance as he
pleted 17 passes for 212 yards and
Stanford's only touchdown. High
lights of the game were the fine de
fensive playing of Gordy White,
Leon King, Russ Pomeroy, and Bill
McColl. McColl made several sen
sational catches on offense and
threw a pass that traveled 65 yards
in the air but fell incomplete.
For the first time since 1946,
Stanford will go into the Big Game
in the role of the favorite. The bet
ting odds mean nothing, however,
as the record of past Indian-Bear
battles proves.
The Stanford-Cal series, one of
the closest of major grid rivalries,
is also the closest in the way of
games won. To date, the Cards have
won 23 games, Cal 21, and nine have
been ties. Cal has 601 total points,
however, to Stanford's 579.
The whole thing started back in
1891 when a group of Stanford
students, led by Herbert Hoover,
challenged Cal to a game. The
auair took place the following

Three years later, Cal nabbed
their first victory as they eked

1921, 28-0 in 1922, and 9-0 in 1923,
Ernie Nevers' first year.
The turning point was 1924, as
many Stanford fans called this one
the greatest of all Big Games.
With 10 minutes to go in the game
and Cal out in front 20-6, Stanford
began to rally. Ted Shipkey made
a phenomenal catch for one Stan

with four seconds left to play, made
another brilliant touchdown catch.
With the game practically over,
Cuddeback booted the tying point.

minu<es of p'ar. George Quist
was Stanford's hern as he played
an inspired game at linebacker.
In 1948 the Cards almost upset
the odds again, as they bowed to
the Rose Bowl-bound Bears 7-6. In
1949 a flashy but shallow Card team
held the Bears at bay for two and
a half quarters, maintaining a 14-12
half-time lead. Jack Swaner and
Jim Monachino ran wild in the lat
ter half of the game, however, and
the Indians bowed 33-14.
Last year, in another thriller,
Stanford tied the Pasadena-bound
Bears, 7-7. Gary Kerkorian turned
in an inspired performance as he
pleted 17 passes for 212 yards and
Stanford's only touchdown. High
lights of the game were the fine de
fensive playing of Gordy White,
Leon King, Russ Pomeroy, and Bill
McColl. McColl made several sen
sational catches on offense and
threw a pass that traveled 65 yards
in the air but fell incomplete.
For the first time since 1946,
Stanford will go into the Big Game
in the role of the favorite. The bet
ting odds mean nothing, however,
as the record of past Indian-Bear
battles proves.
The Stanford-Cal series, one of
the closest of major grid rivalries,
is also the closest in the way of
games won. To date, the Cards have
won 23 games, Cal 21, and nine have
been ties. Cal has 601 total points,
however, to Stanford's 579.
The whole thing started back in
1891 when a group of Stanford
students, led by Herbert Hoover,
challenged Cal to a game. The
auair took place the following
spring and Stanford, heavy un
derdogs, beat the Bears 14-10.
Three years later, Cal nabbed
their first victory as they eked
out a 6-0 win.
Rugby took over in 1905 and
lasted for 15 seasons. Stanford won
most of the games under rugby
rules. Then came the deluge.
Headed by such stalwarts as
Brick Muller, Brodie Stephens, and
Boots Erb, the Bears enjoyed one
of their greatest reigns of prosper
ity. In five seasons from 1919 to
1924 the Bears won 42, lost none,
and tied four. In 1919 Cal beat the
Cards 14-10, 38-0 in 1920, 42-7 in
1921, 28-0 in 1922, and 9-0 in 1923,
Ernie Nevers' first year.
The turning point was 1924, as
many Stanford fans called this one
the greatest of all Big Games.
With 10 minutes to go in the game
and Cal out in front 20-6, Stanford
began to rally. Ted Shipkey made
a phenomenal catch for one Stan
ford score and Murray Cuddeback,
with four seconds left to play, made
another brilliant touchdown catch.
With the game practically over,
Cuddeback booted the tying point.
Ernie Nevers sparked the Cards

to a 27-14 win in 1925, and in 1926
the Rose Bowl - bound Indians,
rated number one nationally,
swamped the Bears 41 -Ci. Dick
Hyland sparked the attack as he
scampered 48 yards for a score
in the first quarter. Four years
later Stanford scored their great
est victory as they trounced the
Bears 41-0.
Stanford was winless in their next
two outings, but in 1933, the first
season of the Vow Boys, a reign of
prosperity hit the Farm. In 1933
the Cards won 7-3. They turned the
trick again in 1934, beating Cal 9-7,
and in 1935 they handed Cal their
only defeat of the season as they
won 13-0. Bobby Grayson and Jim
Coffis each scored a touchdown to
knock off the slightly favored Bears.
The departure of the Vow Boys
saw a famine hit the Farm as Cal
won successive victories in four
straight years. The Bears, spear
headed by Vic Bottari, Sam Chap
man, and Perry Schwartz, beat the
Cards 20-0 in 1936 and 13-0 in 1937.
In 1940 Stanford succeeded in
shocking the football world by
winning ten straight under a new
coach, Clark Shaughnessy, and
the T-formation, then a new sys
tem. Frankie Albert, Stanford's
All-American quarterback, engi
neered the Cards to a 12-7 win
over the Bears. Kmetovic and
Gallarneau scored for Stanford.
The Bears and Cards traded
punches for the next two years as
Cal won 16-0 in 1941 but bowed
to the Cards 26-7 in '42.
In 1946, Stanford muscled out a
25-6 victory. The Cal rooters took
the game a trifle hard as they pro
ceeded to tear up the seats of their
stadium and shrieked for Coach
Frank Wickhorst's scalp. They
marched to Wickhorst's home and
serenaded him and his family with
hoots, catcalls, and other insults.
Cal was made the butt of hundreds
of jokes, but they succeeded in re
placing Wickhorst with Pappy Wal
dorf, one of the greatest of modern
coaches.
Next year saw Stanford rise
up and almost upset (he odds that
had the Bears 10-1 favorites. Cal
won 21-18, a desperation pass
from Jack Jensen to Paul Keck
ley paying off in the last three
minu<es of p'ar. George Quist
