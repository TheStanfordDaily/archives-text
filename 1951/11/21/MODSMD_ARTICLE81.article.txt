# Defensive Grid-O-Scope
## Fifty-fourth Big Game 
### MIKE HUDSON 
84 BATLETT 61" 200 LE 199 6' RYE 28
Bartlett has never impressed us much, but he has been playing first
string at Cal for two years and is a frequent game captain, so he must
have something. Rye has been very fine throughout the season and his
last-gasp tackle of Santa Clara's Hank Burget probably kept Stanford's
record from being blemished with a tic.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
88 MESERVE 6'3" 220 LT 214 6*4" LATHAM 29
Meserve is an improving soph who charges hard but can be trapped, j
Waldorf has stated that he considers Meserve a great prospect for the
future. Latham is one of many "come-throughs" who dot the defensive
line-up. Just another JV last year, he has partially filled the huge gap
created when Jim Vick was shifted to the offensive line.
EDGE TO CAL.
GLICK 5*10" 210 LG 226 6'3" KING
Glick strikes us as being the high point in a far-below-par Bear de- I
fensive line. Against Minnesota he completely thwarted Minnesota's early
line-bucks and the Gophers gave up trying to move him out early in the
contest. The mammoth King is alternately a hope and a despair in the
Card line. If he can match his first-half play against USC, Cal's vaunted
running attack should wilt considerably.
EDGE TO CAL.
RICHTER 6'3" 225 RG 204 511" CONE
Neither Cone, who is playing at about two-thirds speed because of
injuries, nor the steady Hart Cook can match the fabulous Leo Richter.
Richter is a good tackier and a smart line-backer whose occasional circus
plays have brought him Ail-American recognition. Cone plays guard in
Stanford's six-two defense, while Richter is middle line-backer in Cal's
five-three set-up.
EDGE TO CAL.
71 ClIRRAN 62" 212 RT 198 6'2" KIRKLANI) 21
When Glen Gulvin was declared out for the season, Cal's already weak !
defense received another shattering blow. Curran is normally second
string defensive left tackle. He may start, or it may be John Miksits or
Dwight Ely who will get the nod. All will be lucky to survive the day
against Stanford's Jim Vick. Kirkland, a USC transfer, is another sur
prise in Stanford's defense. How he holds up against Cal's Karpe will be
a key factor in the game's outcome.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
PELONIS 61" 180 RE 184 6'2" EADIE 4
Pelonis is another reserve starting for the injury-ridden Bears, al
though he is still a pretty good end. Eadie has been outwitted but seldom
outplayed. He and Rye are a fine rough pair of defensive wingmcn.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
154 C'ADENASSO 5'U" 195 LLB 202 6 0" TANNER 20
Cadenasso, in our opinion, is a strong reason why Washington and
Washington State scored 63 points off Cal. He is a fair tackier but rarely
seems to be in the right place and seems helpless against the short pass,
which i3 Stanford's best weapon. Tanner, a soph, has almost made Card
fans forget the loss of Russ Pomeroy. His heroic tackles of Hugh McEl
henny and Frank Gifford probably saved the Washington and USC games.
He should gain national recognition next year.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
.'}8 NORRIS 5'10" 190 RLB 196 "11" ESSEGIAN 56
Norris, Don Mitchell (whose picture is to the left), and many other
candidates have been tried out here. Norris, a rough frosh, teems to be
the best of the lot. However, his inexperience should show against Stan
ford's polished attack. Essegian is another glorious come-through for
Stanford. Last year he was just another one of Stanford's mob of full
backs. This year at line-backer, he has made three crucial interceptions j
and proved to be a sharp tackier.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
10 LEM MON 61" 195 LHB 188 6 0" THOMPSON 6
LemMon is an outstanding ball-player. A jarring tackier, he often
comes up from his halfback position to throw the ball-carrier for a loss
and yet he never seems to be out of position on passes. Thompson is
another tribute to Chuck Taylor's coaching ability. A reserve end as a
frosh, he is now one of Stanford's tremendous trio of defensive backs.
EDGE TO CAL.
21 LEE 61" 180 RUB 191 6'2" HORN 54
Cal is in real trouble here. Pappy must go with Dick Lee, JV quarter
back, a crippled Sam Williams, JV halfback Dean O'Hare, or freshman
Paul Larson. All have shown little ability in the defensive slot except
Williams. Larson's picture is shown here. Horn came to Stanford tabbed
as a great prospect. He achieved his greatness, but at a spot no one ever
considered, defensive halfback. He, LeMon, and Washington's Sprague
would be our All-PCC defensive backfield.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
25 WILLSEY 5'10" 170 SM 174 6 1" SANDERS 16
Someone named John Peterson played at safety for a while for the
Bears. Willsey, another reserve quarterback, started against Washington
and showed little. It could be A1 Talley, Robison, or Larson in the Big
Game. Nobody seems to know. Sanders, although only a frosh, exhibits
two traits that Card safety men have lacked in recent years. He is a fine
pass-defender and he can hold on to punts.
EDGE TO STANFORD. •
CONSENSUS—Stanford 7 to 4. Injuries to Sammy Williams and Glen
Gulvin have brought Cal's defense to its lowest ebb in four years. Wal
dorf is altering his lineup weekly and the above line-up will probably bo
far different from the one which starts the Big Game. Stanford has a so-so
running defense and a magnificent pass defense. In addition, the defense
seems to become inspired in the clutch. Cal's running offense will be the
finest they have met all year, however. Over-all consensus—STANFORD
TO WIN in a high-scoring contest.

Someone named John Peterson played at safety for a while for the

and showed little. It could be A1 Talley, Robison, or Larson in the Big

two traits that Card safety men have lacked in recent years. He is a fine
pass-defender and he can hold on to punts.
EDGE TO STANFORD. •
CONSENSUS—Stanford 7 to 4. Injuries to Sammy Williams and Glen
Gulvin have brought Cal's defense to its lowest ebb in four years. Wal
dorf is altering his lineup weekly and the above line-up will probably bo
far different from the one which starts the Big Game. Stanford has a so-so
running defense and a magnificent pass defense. In addition, the defense
seems to become inspired in the clutch. Cal's running offense will be the
finest they have met all year, however. Over-all consensus—STANFORD
TO WIN in a high-scoring contest.

84 BATLETT 61" 200 LE 199 6' RYE 28
Bartlett has never impressed us much, but he has been playing first
string at Cal for two years and is a frequent game captain, so he must
have something. Rye has been very fine throughout the season and his
last-gasp tackle of Santa Clara's Hank Burget probably kept Stanford's
record from being blemished with a tic.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
88 MESERVE 6'3" 220 LT 214 6*4" LATHAM 29
Meserve is an improving soph who charges hard but can be trapped, j
Waldorf has stated that he considers Meserve a great prospect for the
future. Latham is one of many "come-throughs" who dot the defensive
line-up. Just another JV last year, he has partially filled the huge gap
created when Jim Vick was shifted to the offensive line.
EDGE TO CAL.
GLICK 5*10" 210 LG 226 6'3" KING
Glick strikes us as being the high point in a far-below-par Bear de- I
fensive line. Against Minnesota he completely thwarted Minnesota's early
line-bucks and the Gophers gave up trying to move him out early in the
contest. The mammoth King is alternately a hope and a despair in the
Card line. If he can match his first-half play against USC, Cal's vaunted
running attack should wilt considerably.
EDGE TO CAL.
RICHTER 6'3" 225 RG 204 511" CONE
Neither Cone, who is playing at about two-thirds speed because of
injuries, nor the steady Hart Cook can match the fabulous Leo Richter.
Richter is a good tackier and a smart line-backer whose occasional circus
plays have brought him Ail-American recognition. Cone plays guard in
Stanford's six-two defense, while Richter is middle line-backer in Cal's
five-three set-up.
EDGE TO CAL.
71 ClIRRAN 62" 212 RT 198 6'2" KIRKLANI) 21
When Glen Gulvin was declared out for the season, Cal's already weak !
defense received another shattering blow. Curran is normally second
string defensive left tackle. He may start, or it may be John Miksits or
Dwight Ely who will get the nod. All will be lucky to survive the day
against Stanford's Jim Vick. Kirkland, a USC transfer, is another sur
prise in Stanford's defense. How he holds up against Cal's Karpe will be
a key factor in the game's outcome.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
PELONIS 61" 180 RE 184 6'2" EADIE 4
Pelonis is another reserve starting for the injury-ridden Bears, al
though he is still a pretty good end. Eadie has been outwitted but seldom
outplayed. He and Rye are a fine rough pair of defensive wingmcn.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
154 C'ADENASSO 5'U" 195 LLB 202 6 0" TANNER 20
Cadenasso, in our opinion, is a strong reason why Washington and
Washington State scored 63 points off Cal. He is a fair tackier but rarely
seems to be in the right place and seems helpless against the short pass,
which i3 Stanford's best weapon. Tanner, a soph, has almost made Card
fans forget the loss of Russ Pomeroy. His heroic tackles of Hugh McEl
henny and Frank Gifford probably saved the Washington and USC games.
He should gain national recognition next year.

Norris, Don Mitchell (whose picture is to the left), and many other

the best of the lot. However, his inexperience should show against Stan
ford's polished attack. Essegian is another glorious come-through for
Stanford. Last year he was just another one of Stanford's mob of full
backs. This year at line-backer, he has made three crucial interceptions j
and proved to be a sharp tackier.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
10 LEM MON 61" 195 LHB 188 6 0" THOMPSON 6
LemMon is an outstanding ball-player. A jarring tackier, he often
comes up from his halfback position to throw the ball-carrier for a loss
and yet he never seems to be out of position on passes. Thompson is
another tribute to Chuck Taylor's coaching ability. A reserve end as a
frosh, he is now one of Stanford's tremendous trio of defensive backs.

Cal is in real trouble here. Pappy must go with Dick Lee, JV quarter

Paul Larson. All have shown little ability in the defensive slot except
Williams. Larson's picture is shown here. Horn came to Stanford tabbed

the best of the lot. However, his inexperience should show against Stan
ford's polished attack. Essegian is another glorious come-through for
Stanford. Last year he was just another one of Stanford's mob of full
backs. This year at line-backer, he has made three crucial interceptions j
and proved to be a sharp tackier.

LemMon is an outstanding ball-player. A jarring tackier, he often

and yet he never seems to be out of position on passes. Thompson is
another tribute to Chuck Taylor's coaching ability. A reserve end as a
frosh, he is now one of Stanford's tremendous trio of defensive backs.
EDGE TO CAL.
21 LEE 61" 180 RUB 191 6'2" HORN 54
Cal is in real trouble here. Pappy must go with Dick Lee, JV quarter
back, a crippled Sam Williams, JV halfback Dean O'Hare, or freshman
Paul Larson. All have shown little ability in the defensive slot except
Williams. Larson's picture is shown here. Horn came to Stanford tabbed
as a great prospect. He achieved his greatness, but at a spot no one ever
considered, defensive halfback. He, LeMon, and Washington's Sprague
would be our All-PCC defensive backfield.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
25 WILLSEY 5'10" 170 SM 174 6 1" SANDERS 16
Someone named John Peterson played at safety for a while for the
Bears. Willsey, another reserve quarterback, started against Washington
and showed little. It could be A1 Talley, Robison, or Larson in the Big
Game. Nobody seems to know. Sanders, although only a frosh, exhibits
two traits that Card safety men have lacked in recent years. He is a fine
pass-defender and he can hold on to punts.
EDGE TO STANFORD. •
CONSENSUS—Stanford 7 to 4. Injuries to Sammy Williams and Glen
Gulvin have brought Cal's defense to its lowest ebb in four years. Wal
dorf is altering his lineup weekly and the above line-up will probably bo
far different from the one which starts the Big Game. Stanford has a so-so
running defense and a magnificent pass defense. In addition, the defense
seems to become inspired in the clutch. Cal's running offense will be the
finest they have met all year, however. Over-all consensus—STANFORD
TO WIN in a high-scoring contest.

Bartlett has never impressed us much, but he has been playing first
string at Cal for two years and is a frequent game captain, so he must
have something. Rye has been very fine throughout the season and his
last-gasp tackle of Santa Clara's Hank Burget probably kept Stanford's

Meserve is an improving soph who charges hard but can be trapped, j
Waldorf has stated that he considers Meserve a great prospect for the
future. Latham is one of many "come-throughs" who dot the defensive
line-up. Just another JV last year, he has partially filled the huge gap
created when Jim Vick was shifted to the offensive line.

GLICK 5*10" 210 LG 226 6'3" KING
Glick strikes us as being the high point in a far-below-par Bear de- I
fensive line. Against Minnesota he completely thwarted Minnesota's early
line-bucks and the Gophers gave up trying to move him out early in the
contest. The mammoth King is alternately a hope and a despair in the
Card line. If he can match his first-half play against USC, Cal's vaunted
running attack should wilt considerably.
EDGE TO CAL.
RICHTER 6'3" 225 RG 204 511" CONE
Neither Cone, who is playing at about two-thirds speed because of
injuries, nor the steady Hart Cook can match the fabulous Leo Richter.
Richter is a good tackier and a smart line-backer whose occasional circus
plays have brought him Ail-American recognition. Cone plays guard in
Stanford's six-two defense, while Richter is middle line-backer in Cal's
five-three set-up.

string defensive left tackle. He may start, or it may be John Miksits or
Dwight Ely who will get the nod. All will be lucky to survive the day

a key factor in the game's outcome.

PELONIS 61" 180 RE 184 6'2" EADIE 4

Cadenasso, in our opinion, is a strong reason why Washington and

seems to be in the right place and seems helpless against the short pass,
which i3 Stanford's best weapon. Tanner, a soph, has almost made Card

Dwight Ely who will get the nod. All will be lucky to survive the day
against Stanford's Jim Vick. Kirkland, a USC transfer, is another sur
prise in Stanford's defense. How he holds up against Cal's Karpe will be
a key factor in the game's outcome.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
PELONIS 61" 180 RE 184 6'2" EADIE 4
Pelonis is another reserve starting for the injury-ridden Bears, al
though he is still a pretty good end. Eadie has been outwitted but seldom
outplayed. He and Rye are a fine rough pair of defensive wingmcn.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
154 C'ADENASSO 5'U" 195 LLB 202 6 0" TANNER 20
Cadenasso, in our opinion, is a strong reason why Washington and
Washington State scored 63 points off Cal. He is a fair tackier but rarely
seems to be in the right place and seems helpless against the short pass,
which i3 Stanford's best weapon. Tanner, a soph, has almost made Card
fans forget the loss of Russ Pomeroy. His heroic tackles of Hugh McEl
henny and Frank Gifford probably saved the Washington and USC games.
He should gain national recognition next year.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
.'}8 NORRIS 5'10" 190 RLB 196 "11" ESSEGIAN 56
Norris, Don Mitchell (whose picture is to the left), and many other
candidates have been tried out here. Norris, a rough frosh, teems to be
the best of the lot. However, his inexperience should show against Stan
ford's polished attack. Essegian is another glorious come-through for
Stanford. Last year he was just another one of Stanford's mob of full
backs. This year at line-backer, he has made three crucial interceptions j
and proved to be a sharp tackier.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
10 LEM MON 61" 195 LHB 188 6 0" THOMPSON 6
LemMon is an outstanding ball-player. A jarring tackier, he often
comes up from his halfback position to throw the ball-carrier for a loss
and yet he never seems to be out of position on passes. Thompson is
another tribute to Chuck Taylor's coaching ability. A reserve end as a
frosh, he is now one of Stanford's tremendous trio of defensive backs.
EDGE TO CAL.
21 LEE 61" 180 RUB 191 6'2" HORN 54
Cal is in real trouble here. Pappy must go with Dick Lee, JV quarter
back, a crippled Sam Williams, JV halfback Dean O'Hare, or freshman
Paul Larson. All have shown little ability in the defensive slot except
Williams. Larson's picture is shown here. Horn came to Stanford tabbed
as a great prospect. He achieved his greatness, but at a spot no one ever
considered, defensive halfback. He, LeMon, and Washington's Sprague
would be our All-PCC defensive backfield.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
25 WILLSEY 5'10" 170 SM 174 6 1" SANDERS 16
Someone named John Peterson played at safety for a while for the
Bears. Willsey, another reserve quarterback, started against Washington
and showed little. It could be A1 Talley, Robison, or Larson in the Big
Game. Nobody seems to know. Sanders, although only a frosh, exhibits
two traits that Card safety men have lacked in recent years. He is a fine
pass-defender and he can hold on to punts.
EDGE TO STANFORD. •
CONSENSUS—Stanford 7 to 4. Injuries to Sammy Williams and Glen
Gulvin have brought Cal's defense to its lowest ebb in four years. Wal
dorf is altering his lineup weekly and the above line-up will probably bo
far different from the one which starts the Big Game. Stanford has a so-so
running defense and a magnificent pass defense. In addition, the defense
seems to become inspired in the clutch. Cal's running offense will be the
finest they have met all year, however. Over-all consensus—STANFORD
TO WIN in a high-scoring contest.
