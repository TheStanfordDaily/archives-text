# Offensive Grid-O-Scope
## Fifty-fourth Big Game 
### MIKE HUDSON 
81 ELLIS ti'2" 20H LE 18:i «'1" STORUM 5)
Ellis is a typical Cal end. He blocks well, but is a poor pass receiver. |
Sophomore Jim Kidder, who's a better pass-cetcher than Ellis, should see i
plenty of action too. Storum is al'o a starter because of His blocking ability
and Sam Morley takes over when another pass-receiver is needed. EDGE ,
TO CAE.
72 KARPE «'2" 221 LT 22!) 6'3" VICK 7
A battle of the goliaths. Karpe is an all-coast tackle. He is a booming
blocker and a key reason for the success of Cal's running attack in the last
two years. Vick has turned into about second string all-coast material, i
He played a memorable game against USC and is big, fast, and rough, j
EDGE TO CAE.
Kl MAIORANA 5*9" 203 EG 1 !»7 510" MANOOGIAN Hi
Maiorana may be unseated by Tom Dutton come Big Game time. Both j
arc fast men who can pull out and lead Cal's mad stampedes around end or
lead the up-tbe-middle charges with equal ease. Of course neither they or j
any other offensive guard nn the coast can compare with Manoogian. Man- j
oopian has been frustrating highly-touted line-backers all year with his j
blocking, in addition to pulling out and giving Gary Kerkorian some stellar j
pass protection. Norm would have undoubtedly gained national recognition |
had not two or three of his team-mates played more spectacular ball. Wait
till next year. EDGE TO STANFORD.
54 HARRIS Ci'l" 200 C 195 «'()" GARNER 38
Harris is one of the few happy surprises on a disappointing Cal team.
Only a soph, Harris impressed us with his potent blocking. Pappy Wal
dorf apparently doe n't share our high opinion of Harris, for he ftarted
Leigh ton Halm in the Oret.on game. Whether Harris is worse than we
thought., or Hahn is a good line-man, we don't know. We still doubt
whether Garner, who will be playing with a bad knee, or his replacement
Dan Tohin can quite measure up to Harris's blocking ability. EDGE TO
CAE.
fi3 BENDER 5'10" I!>s RG 2011 BONEITI !57
Bender is another rock in what wc still consider is America's greatest
offensive line. There is little to say about these lads cxcept that they are
all rough, big, and good blockers. It's s~ad to contemplate that the entire
line returns next year. Bonetti was a good defensive lineman last year and j
he's a good offensive lineman this year. The Stanford offensive line, which !
isn't so bad itself, will also he in good shape next year with both guards and j
tackles returning. EDGE TO CAE.
73 KREUGER 21S RT 21« (>'! > ■/' BRODEFICK 4fi j
A tremendous quartette of offensive tackles will be parading their wares !
next Saturday. Kreuger rivals Karpe as best Bear lineman. Against Min- j
nerota, Cal gained off the tackles with pathetic ease. Broderick is big and j
rough and an excellent blocker, but neither he or Dick can quite match ]
Karpe and Krcuger's demoniac precision. EDGE TO CAL.
K0 HOOD 6'3" 205 RE 225 K'<l" McCOLL 3
Hood has broken the Cal record for receptions. He is a good blocker and \
the best end Waldorf has had at Cal. McColl is one of the greatest pass
receivers in the history of football. He is also a very good blocker, decoy, I
and giver of advice to the rooting section. If McColl doesn't win the Heisman I
trophy, 90,000 Los Angelinas and all Stanford fans will agree that the fix is in.
EDGE TO STANFORD.
22 MAIS 5*10" 175 OB IX2 5'U" KERKORIAN 17
Mais and Kerkorian both follow old school traditions. Mais is following ,
in the footsteps of such passing wizards as Boots Erb Jr. and Jim Marinos,
while Kerkorian follows the tradition of Frankie Albert. We feel that the J
only reason Mais ever connects with his wobbling passes is that th? defense
is drawn in to stop Cal's thundering running attack. Bill should find the j
going rough against Stanford's boomerang boys, Essegian, Horn, etc. Ker- j
korian, like Albert, is best when the pressure is on, is a great short passer. !
provides an extra threat with his running ability, can stand up under heavy ,
physical punishment, and plays All-American ball. Mais is a smooth ball
handler and a fine duck-hunting companion for Olszewski. EDGE TO
STANFORD.
15 WEST 5'9" 175 LHB IS:! li'll" HUGASIAN 25
West is a typical Cal back. He is a powerful, though unspectacular
runner and a good blocker. The colorful Hugasian is Stanford's leading
ground-gainer. He turned in a great game against USC. Wc take Hugasian j
on his pass-catching ability and his ability to always play smart football. |
EDGE TO STANFORD.
45 ROBISON (>'l ' 100 11118 185 «'(►" SOUTHVVOOD 31
For the past two years, Robison has been a great defensive back and ,
punter while gaining over seven yards a clip on his occasional runs. This j
year he has been moved to offense and only early season injuries have slowed
him down. He is in top shape now and is an outstanding runner, blocker j
and a great pro prospect. Johnny Pappa, an outstanding break-away run- ,
ner but a cream-puff blocker, might see action here too. Southwood is
Stanford's hard-luck guy. An outstanding runner, he has been plagued
with injuries for three years. He gained over 100 yards against Michigan,
the only time he has been in tip-top shape. We doubt that he'll be able to
hit full stride against Cal, but watch out for him in the Rose Bowl. Eon
Cook will probably spell Southwood considerably. EDGE TO CAE.
36 OLSZEWSKI 5'11" 195 FB 204 fi'3" MATHIAS 49 j
Nobody knows exactly who is going to play in the key full-back slot j
for the Bears. The injured Olszewski, who is America's best back when !
healthy, will probably retire midway in the first quarter after being hit by .
Tanner or King. Next the injured Don Johnson may take over and he ought
to last about three minutes. Jed Adams is definitely out, so fourth-stringer
Don Harris may carry the brunt of the attack. Robison or West may be
shifted to full-back in which case Bill Powell, John Pappa, or Paul Larson j
will play half-back. It's all pretty confusing, but if Olszewski can stay
healthy, look out. They haven't lost with him in there yet. Mathias is
a great track star who is fast, becoming a grid star. He made a pretty good
run against USC that you might have heard about. He appears to be for
calmer in crucial situations than the rooting section and will be the key
man in the Card attack next. year. EVEN.
CONSENSUS—CaI, fi to 4 with one even. Stanford has a good running
attack and a brilliant passing attack which adds up to a well-rounded :
offense. The one thing they lack is the ability to make the long gain, al- |
though Mathias has the speed to remedy this situation. Cal has a mag
nificent rushing attack and a passing attack that ranges from puny to putrid.
Offense—EVEN. It's the defense that tells the talc.
