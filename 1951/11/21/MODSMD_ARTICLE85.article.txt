# Stanford's Axe Awaiting Game's Victor
## Axe Carves Keen Edge On Indian-Bear Clash 
### FRANKIE KING 
Stanford rooters were already
yelling "give 'em the axe right
in the neck" in 1899, but it took
an enterprising yell leader to
give real meaning to the cheer.
Billy Erb was the veil leader who
fashioned the axe from a rusty 10-
pound, 15-inch blade an J a make
shift handle. He did it to bolster
the waning spirits of the '99 base
ball team, who laced a three-game
championship series with Cal with
out their star player, George Beck
ett. Eib organized a huge rally to
build up spirit and as an added
boo ter presented his axe, which
by this time had acquired a coat
of red paint and a razor-keen edge.
Stanford Loses
The axe was prominently dis
played before the Stanford rooting
section at the baseball game, but
Stanford lost despite the new tro
phy.
And in the next chaotic hours
they lost the axe.
Several Cal men organized a plot
to capture the axe, overpowered
and outnumbered the few Stanford
axe guardians, and raced out of the
field, tossing the heavy axe back
and forth between them.
For a hopeful minute it looked
like Stanford might retrieve their
axe. A Cal plotter handed it to the
runner next to him, who turned out
to be a Stanford man. The Stan
fordite made a lunge to escape but
was brought to the ground by a
burly Cal football player.
Via streetcar the axe was carried
to a butcher shop where its trouble
some handle was chopped off. The
axe blade was smuggled aboard a
ferryboat under someone's over-

I coat. Another Cal man limped stiff
ly onto the ferrv. the handle of the
axe hidden in his trouser leg.
'Immortal 21"
Despite several well - planned
raids on the axe's California hide
| away, Stanford had to wait for 31
| years lor the "Immortal 21" to re-
I cover their trophy, 'lhe "21," 21
boys from Sequoia Hall, spent the
j years between 1927 and 1930 plan
! ning and perfecting plots to re
trieve the axe. In 1920 they ha ! a
sure-fire scheme and they tried it
out at the annual Cal axe rally.
Poking as newspapermen but with
tear gas bombs in place of the fla h
I bulbs on their cameras, the "21"
I strolled to the rally. Proud Cal axe
i guards were on!v too pleased to
j have the axe's picture taken.
They discovered their mistake
whtn the 'newspapermen" explod
ed the tear gas bombs in their
laces. In the confusion that fol
lowed, the axe disappeared. Other
members of the "21" ran about or
ganizing seaiching parties, which
i they speedily sent off in the oppo
) site direction from the planned es
cape route.
Home for Three
The axe was finally back on home
I ground and stayed there for three
I years. In 1933 Cal and Stanford
! agreed to use the axe for the Big
Game trophy.
For the past 16 years the axe
has been volleyed back and forth
: between Cal and Stanford. It was
| stolen Irom Stanford four times
| since then, the latest raid taking
place in April of 194G. Four Cal
men walked out of the Cellar, the
Axe's Stanford berth, with the axe,
case and all. It showed up again
in a Palo Alto patrol car during the
| next football season just in time to
; be presented by Governor Warren
j to Stanford at the Big Game.
; The next year, 1947, Cal legally
won it back, and they've been hang
-1 ing on to it since then.
It will come out from its current
den, a Berkeley bank vault, for a
[ public appearance at the Big Game.


BORN AT BATâ€”On its birthday the Axe's adventures began.
The rooters got a brief glimpse of the trophy, it was tossed, lost,
and finally ferried across the Bay, until 31 years later and re
covery by the "Immortal 21."
