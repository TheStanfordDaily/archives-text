### 
Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, pre.si- j
dent of the University of California, 1
say.; Cal classes are not as large a:> 1
many people think.
He explained, "The university of- ;
fers a number of lecture courses j
winch attract large enrollments of
from 200 to I.OIIU students. It is I
these courses which lead people to
believe that classes are all large.
Actually, less than three per cent
are this large. The median size class
last full was 22.3."
