DEFINITION—It's the sight cf
the bonfire flaming against
the night sky, it's the Axe Yell
in a crucial moment, it's the
worry about a very special
Saturday night date, it's two
all - white sections pitted
against each other in a yelling
contest, it's "one, two, three,
■flip" and "great, gang," it's a
hurried and somewhat neg
lected Thanksgiving turkey,
it's hard work for those who
must plan ahead, it's Home
coming and crepe paper for
the alums, it's 90,000 excited
spec'.ators, it's a colorful eve
ning at the Gaieties, it's empty
classrooms and libraries, it's
concentration on one thing
above all else, it's 22 men of
muscle and fighting spirit on
a hundred-yard green plot, it's
awareness of a very special
trophy, it's the event of the
•year, it's BIG GAME.
