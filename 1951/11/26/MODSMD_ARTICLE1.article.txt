TOKYO, Monday, Nov. 26 (UP)—Allied and Communist staff offi
cers met today in Panmunjom to try to draw the last 35 miles of a
tentative Korean cease-fire line, but it appeared the Reds were
stalling while they tried to win key heights on the 145-mile front.
Hope faded for a pre-Christmas armistice as the officers argued

over possession of 10 Korean hills
claimed by both sides. One of these
"Armistice Ridge"—fell to the Al
lies Sunday morning.
Allied officers said about 75 per
cent of the truce line had been
mapped, and the official Allied
spokesman said it was possible the
mapmakevs could reach agreement
at today's meeting, which began at
10 a.m. (11 p.m. Sunday PST).
But the officer was not optimistic.
