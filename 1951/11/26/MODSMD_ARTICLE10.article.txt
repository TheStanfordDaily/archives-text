# Mystery Flag Atop Tower
## 
### 
A red and white forked pennant
was discovered yesterday tied on to
the flag pole on top of Hoover
Tower. The pennant lias not been
definitely identified as a Stanford
pennant.
Two theories have been advanced
as to how the pennant got there.
One, that a helicopter was used and
the entire job was done from the
air, gets its support from reports
received from Berkeley police last
week that Cal students were con
sidering lighting the bonfire and at
tacking the Hoover Tower from the
air with a helicopter. Police report
only two airplanes over the campus
Saturday night, however, and nei
ther one was a helicopter.
The other possibility is that it was
a completely "inside" job, done from
the ground up. Pranksters would
have had to break into the building
and ascend inside the tower up to
the top dome with the light in it;
once this far, there is a small door
way and ladder up to the base of
the flagpole.
In support of this theory, the po
lice have offered the following in
formation. The tower light burned
out at about 10 p.m. Friday. The
electrician was called immediately,
and the cupola lights were turned
on for the sake of night flyers from
Moffett Field. Saturday morning
the electrician went up to replace
the light.
The electrician al ;o stated that he
could have possibly left the top door
unlocked. That would have been of
no help to invaders unless they had
already broken through up to that
point.
