# BEAR POWER STOPS WIN STREAK, 20-7
## Cards Never In Big Game 
### EARL ODELL 
Spcrts Editor, The Daily
Into each life some rain must
{all, and the fall came hard last
Saturday for the mighty Stanford
Indians, as a mightier Golden
Bear team up and crushed the
PCC champions and probable
Rose Bowl representatives, 20
to 7.
Viewing the game objectively
if that's possible -there tan be no
excuses, no alibis. For the Tribe
trainer Connie Jarvis summed up
the situation by saying, "Afier an
emotional season like this, you have
to expect a letdown sometime."
Those who have followed the In
dians all year shook their heads un
believingly after that game. They
just couldn't believe that this was
the bunch that in the previous nine
games had risen to every occasion
with so much poise and confidence.
'I he spectators who came ex
pecting to see the battle of the
cenii.vy were obviously disap
pointed, for there was no battle.
It must be said that at no time
wen* the Cards ever in the ball
game. They were never a serious
threat.
Pappy Waldorf, California's ro
tund head mentor, summed up the
situation for his team when he said,
"They wanted that game." Never
were truer words spoken, and never
was a team higher for a game than
the Bears Saturday.
They made no mistakes, proving
that they were extremely high. We
have no doubt that on another Sat
urday the 1951 Cards could give
the Bears more than their money's
worth, but last Saturday it was all
California and Stanford was merely
the opposition.
Ten years ago another hot
bunch of Indians went into the
Big (;ame favored to tear the
Bears apart only to be soundly
beaten, 16 to 0. This 1941 team,
like the present one, had a potent
passing attack led by a fellow
named Frankie Albert. They also
had an All-American in a guard,
Chuck Taylor. And like last Sat
urday's game, the Golden Bears
used the strategy of rushing the
passer to death.
The following day came a
writeup in the San Francisco
Chronicle—it's been posted in the
Stanford dressing room all week
— which could have been used
yesterday at a great savin,? of
copy paper.
One paragraph, we think, is par
ticularly appropriate. It says, in ef
fect :
"This was a different Stanford.
Walloped, beaten at every turn,
outcharged, outfought, and out
thought, this was simply the re
mains of a team that electrified the

nation this year with its dazzling
speed and fire.''
From the very outset tho Bears
ruled the ball game. Receiving
Chuck Hokanson's kickofl, it tuok
only ten plays and four and a half
minutes for Cal to take the lead, a
lead tiiey never lost. In those ton
plays the Bears literally tore the
Stanford defense apart — the same
defense, we might add, that time
after time has held onto a mere
yard when the opposition threw ev
:_>ry ounce ol their strength into the
attack.
(in the tenth play Cal's fullback
Don Kobison, replacing the Bears'
greatest hack, Johnny Olszewski,
who was never missed, scored
with a :i4-yard jaunt off tackle.
And from the looks of the hole
that was laid open in the Card
line for him, he probably could
have walked in.
Card fans looked and disbelieved,
but passed ft olf by saying to them
selves that things like this had hap
pened before, and it was nothing to
worry about. "Just wait'll the In
dians get their hands on the ball',"
they'd have told you.
But something went wrong.
Starting on their own 28 following
the kickoff, the Indians chalked up
a first down in short order, but thi.t
was all. Cal's big defensive line was
too rough and ready. The Bears
played the Stanfords' vaunted of
fense perfectly. They were every
where they should have been, and
the Indians couldn't find a single
weakness.
In the second quarter the Bears
amazed the 90,000-odd fans by scor
ing a second time with the "Poise
Boys" still struggling. This time
halfback Johnny Pappa drove over
left guard on a trap play for 22
yards. The second TD looked as
easy as the first.
The second half saw the Stan
ford fans come to life with a little
as it looked like the Indians might
he opening up with their famed
4attack, but it turned out the Bear
defense was playing like the Cartf
defense had all year — giving
ground when it didn't hurt, but
holding when it might.
A few minutes into the fourth
quarter Cal crushed all hopes of
an Indian victory, scoring on a 78-
yard drive which culminated in a
six-pointer when Pappa broke over
left tackle for lour yards. Les Rich
ter's conversion, unlike his previous
two, was no good.
The Cards were at least too proud
to accept a shutout as they took the
kickoff and marched back to the
California end zone, mainly on the
strength ol' the Kerkorian-to-Mc-
Coll pass. Left end Sam Morley
caught Gary Kerkorian's bootleg
pass all by himself in the end zone
lor Stanford's only score of the day,
and the last touchdown o£ the after
noon.
The California win must be at
tributed a great deal to the tre
mendous line charge of both the
Bear offense and the defense. If you
don't believe us, take it from Bill

McColl, who said, "We lost the in
dividual balance in the line."
Roughly translated, that means that
man for man the Cards were out
charged and outfought.
It looks like the only way for the
Indians to live this one down is to
whip the hell out of Illinois in the
Rose Bowl next Jan. 1.

had an All-American in a guard,
Chuck Taylor. And like last Sat
urday's game, the Golden Bears
used the strategy of rushing the
passer to death.
The following day came a
writeup in the San Francisco
Chronicle—it's been posted in the
Stanford dressing room all week
— which could have been used
yesterday at a great savin,? of
copy paper.
One paragraph, we think, is par
ticularly appropriate. It says, in ef
fect :
"This was a different Stanford.
Walloped, beaten at every turn,
outcharged, outfought, and out
thought, this was simply the re
mains of a team that electrified the

nation this year with its dazzling
speed and fire.''
From the very outset tho Bears
ruled the ball game. Receiving
Chuck Hokanson's kickofl, it tuok
only ten plays and four and a half
minutes for Cal to take the lead, a
lead tiiey never lost. In those ton
plays the Bears literally tore the
Stanford defense apart — the same
defense, we might add, that time
after time has held onto a mere
yard when the opposition threw ev
:_>ry ounce ol their strength into the
attack.
(in the tenth play Cal's fullback
Don Kobison, replacing the Bears'
greatest hack, Johnny Olszewski,
who was never missed, scored
with a :i4-yard jaunt off tackle.
And from the looks of the hole
that was laid open in the Card
line for him, he probably could
have walked in.
Card fans looked and disbelieved,
but passed ft olf by saying to them
selves that things like this had hap
pened before, and it was nothing to
worry about. "Just wait'll the In
dians get their hands on the ball',"
they'd have told you.
But something went wrong.
Starting on their own 28 following
the kickoff, the Indians chalked up
a first down in short order, but thi.t
was all. Cal's big defensive line was
too rough and ready. The Bears
played the Stanfords' vaunted of
fense perfectly. They were every
where they should have been, and
the Indians couldn't find a single
weakness.
In the second quarter the Bears
amazed the 90,000-odd fans by scor
ing a second time with the "Poise
Boys" still struggling. This time
halfback Johnny Pappa drove over
left guard on a trap play for 22
yards. The second TD looked as
easy as the first.
The second half saw the Stan
ford fans come to life with a little
as it looked like the Indians might
he opening up with their famed
4attack, but it turned out the Bear
defense was playing like the Cartf
defense had all year — giving
ground when it didn't hurt, but
holding when it might.
A few minutes into the fourth
quarter Cal crushed all hopes of
an Indian victory, scoring on a 78-
yard drive which culminated in a
six-pointer when Pappa broke over
left tackle for lour yards. Les Rich
ter's conversion, unlike his previous
two, was no good.
The Cards were at least too proud
to accept a shutout as they took the
kickoff and marched back to the
California end zone, mainly on the
strength ol' the Kerkorian-to-Mc-
Coll pass. Left end Sam Morley
caught Gary Kerkorian's bootleg
pass all by himself in the end zone
lor Stanford's only score of the day,
and the last touchdown o£ the after
noon.
The California win must be at
tributed a great deal to the tre
mendous line charge of both the
Bear offense and the defense. If you
don't believe us, take it from Bill

McColl, who said, "We lost the in
dividual balance in the line."
Roughly translated, that means that
man for man the Cards were out
charged and outfought.
It looks like the only way for the
Indians to live this one down is to
whip the hell out of Illinois in the
Rose Bowl next Jan. 1.

Into each life some rain must
{all, and the fall came hard last
Saturday for the mighty Stanford
Indians, as a mightier Golden
Bear team up and crushed the
PCC champions and probable
Rose Bowl representatives, 20
to 7.
Viewing the game objectively
if that's possible -there tan be no
excuses, no alibis. For the Tribe
trainer Connie Jarvis summed up
the situation by saying, "Afier an
emotional season like this, you have
to expect a letdown sometime."
Those who have followed the In
dians all year shook their heads un
believingly after that game. They
just couldn't believe that this was
the bunch that in the previous nine
games had risen to every occasion
with so much poise and confidence.
'I he spectators who came ex

situation for his team when he said,
"They wanted that game." Never
were truer words spoken, and never
was a team higher for a game than
the Bears Saturday.
They made no mistakes, proving
that they were extremely high. We
have no doubt that on another Sat

the Bears more than their money's
worth, but last Saturday it was all
California and Stanford was merely
the opposition.

played the Stanfords' vaunted of

where they should have been, and
the Indians couldn't find a single

Into each life some rain must
{all, and the fall came hard last
Saturday for the mighty Stanford
Indians, as a mightier Golden
Bear team up and crushed the
PCC champions and probable
Rose Bowl representatives, 20
to 7.
Viewing the game objectively
if that's possible -there tan be no
excuses, no alibis. For the Tribe
trainer Connie Jarvis summed up
the situation by saying, "Afier an
emotional season like this, you have
to expect a letdown sometime."
Those who have followed the In
dians all year shook their heads un
believingly after that game. They
just couldn't believe that this was
the bunch that in the previous nine
games had risen to every occasion
with so much poise and confidence.
'I he spectators who came ex
pecting to see the battle of the
cenii.vy were obviously disap
pointed, for there was no battle.
It must be said that at no time
wen* the Cards ever in the ball
game. They were never a serious
threat.
Pappy Waldorf, California's ro
tund head mentor, summed up the
situation for his team when he said,
"They wanted that game." Never
were truer words spoken, and never
was a team higher for a game than
the Bears Saturday.
They made no mistakes, proving
that they were extremely high. We
have no doubt that on another Sat
urday the 1951 Cards could give
the Bears more than their money's
worth, but last Saturday it was all
California and Stanford was merely
the opposition.
Ten years ago another hot
bunch of Indians went into the
Big (;ame favored to tear the
Bears apart only to be soundly
beaten, 16 to 0. This 1941 team,
like the present one, had a potent
passing attack led by a fellow
named Frankie Albert. They also
had an All-American in a guard,
Chuck Taylor. And like last Sat
urday's game, the Golden Bears
used the strategy of rushing the
passer to death.
The following day came a
writeup in the San Francisco
Chronicle—it's been posted in the
Stanford dressing room all week
— which could have been used
yesterday at a great savin,? of
copy paper.
One paragraph, we think, is par
ticularly appropriate. It says, in ef
fect :
"This was a different Stanford.
Walloped, beaten at every turn,
outcharged, outfought, and out
thought, this was simply the re
mains of a team that electrified the

nation this year with its dazzling
speed and fire.''
From the very outset tho Bears
ruled the ball game. Receiving
Chuck Hokanson's kickofl, it tuok
only ten plays and four and a half
minutes for Cal to take the lead, a
lead tiiey never lost. In those ton
plays the Bears literally tore the
Stanford defense apart — the same
defense, we might add, that time
after time has held onto a mere
yard when the opposition threw ev
:_>ry ounce ol their strength into the
attack.
(in the tenth play Cal's fullback
Don Kobison, replacing the Bears'
greatest hack, Johnny Olszewski,
who was never missed, scored
with a :i4-yard jaunt off tackle.
And from the looks of the hole
that was laid open in the Card
line for him, he probably could
have walked in.
Card fans looked and disbelieved,
but passed ft olf by saying to them
selves that things like this had hap
pened before, and it was nothing to
worry about. "Just wait'll the In
dians get their hands on the ball',"
they'd have told you.
