## 
### 
(UP) —The Pacific Coast Confer
ence and the Big Ten voted on
their choices for the annual Rose
Bowl spectacle today — but the
balloting was a mere formality
because when the announce
ment is made tomorrow it will be
Illinois vs. Stanford.
(Announcement of distribution
and sale plans for rooters' tickets
will be made burly this week, Stan
ford Athletic Director A 1 Masters
said last night.)
The fighting Illini, who finished
ofl the last two weeks of the season
with a tie against Ohio State and
then a narrow 3-0 against North
western yesterday, are the Western
Conference ehampions.
Stanford, winner of nine straight,
was whipped soundly by California
20-7, but already had the PCC title

wrapped up.
Coach Chuck Taylor of the Stan
ford club, anticipating the bid that
is a certainty, said today that he
would start making plans lor the
Rose Bowl tomorrow.
He'll keep his squad in trim for
the important intersectional by
having them work out on the track.
As far as the Big Game with Cali
fornia was concerned, the Big Ten's
official scout, Wally Curice, found
little that would aid him in his re
port to Coach Kay Eliot of Illinois.
"This is my first at Stanford and
it's tough to judge a club off one
game," said Curice. "The Indians
didn't look too good in spots in this
battle.
"Back in the Big Ten they seem
to stress defense more than they
do here. The game looks strictly
like a tossup to me. It will be u
good offensive team against the
strong Illini defense."
