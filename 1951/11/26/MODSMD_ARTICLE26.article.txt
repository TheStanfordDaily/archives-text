### PETE GROTHE 
BIG GAME POST-MORTEMS
I was proud to be a member of the Stanford rooting
section last Saturday.
Let me preface my remarks by recalling the be
havior of the USC rooters two weeks ago. Many of

them left even before the game
had ended. When the final gun
sounded with Stanford in com
mand, 27 to 20, the band marched
?iut with its tail between its legs.
The Trojan rooters went without
even singing their alma mater.
That was not the case with Stan
ford last Saturday. There was a
moment of stunned silence when
the game ended, and then the band
broke out with the Stanford

Hymn. As I watched those around me, I felt that I
had never seen students put so much into the singing
of the Hymn. It just wasn't Stanford's day, but the
rooters were proud of the team, the coach, and the
school.
It would have been natural for the Stanford root
ingl section, spoiled by nine straight victories, to
"give up" like the Trojan students did two weeks
ago. But even though defeat seemed more evident
t the second half wore on, the Farm rooters never
once let up in the support of their team. With only
two minutes remaining they gave a yell for the
â€¢ losing coach, still the best in the nation for my money
. . . Chuck Taylor. After the Hymn they even sang

several Stanford pep songs. The Stanford rooting
section last Saturday was the very definition of the
Stanford spirit.

You could look at the defeat from two different
angles. Oie, there was not the utter dejection that
there would have been had Stanford lost on a fluke
or a bad break. It was a clear-cut Cal victory, and no
Card fan could deny that. On that given day, Cal
played the better game. They realized that great po
tential that everyone (including myself) had thought
they lost.
On the other hand, a good thing came to an end.
Stanford, who last week ranked third nationally,
will drop now. Taylor, who had gone 25 games as a
head coach without a defeat, dropped his first and
missed a prediction for the initial time. It was es
pecially hard to take if you knew the players and
the coaching staff. Anybody acquainted with them
realized that there wasn't a grander bunch of guys
around and that they definitely deserved to go
through this season undefeated.
After the game, some of the rooters began to chant,
"We're going to the Rose Bowl, we're going to the
Rose Bowl," but it was an empty chant at best. As
one student put it, "Right now, I don't care if we go
to the Roes Bowl; next week I will care. The only
thing I'm concerned about now is that our perfect
season has been spoiled."
For the seniors who had never seen Cal beaten, there
was little consolation. The gray, overcast day set the
proper mood. It just wasn't Stanford's day.
