## Punishment of 'SJS' Painters Criticized 
### 
Dear Editor:
We were shocked by the severity of the punishment
given to those San Jose State students who put "SJS"
in the Stadium turf. We believe that this is not com
parable with the recent paint smear campaign and
that they should not be suspended for one full year
when Stanford students who have done similar things
elsewhere in the past have only been given Con-Home
hours.
We also remember that there was a "UCLA" in the
turf and we have heard of no punishment for that.
If other schools and other people who wish to put
signs on campus would limit their activities to the
Stadium, our problem of keeping the campus present
able would be half solved.
It is definitely vandalism to paint or deface the Quad
or Hoover Library, but it is only rivalry to put initials
in the turf. Somehow those three letters didn't seem
io do us any harm in the game against San Jose noi
sed the "UCLA" against the UCLA team.
Wl>-
Those guys who are now expelled may get drafted
not to mention the loss of the year of school and wc
definitely feel that the punishment should be lowered.
We wondered who brought the pressure to bear, Stan
ford or San Jose State officials.
C'mon let's give these guys a break. Wc might be

in the same position some day ourselves.
