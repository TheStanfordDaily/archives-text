# Declining Rose Bowl Bid
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Stanford's great decision lies not in going to the Rose
Bowl, but in declining the bid!
In recent years many criticisms and objections at
tributable to post season games have made inroads
on the whole concept of collegiate sports. Abuses and
group pressures have made the game difficult for both
administrators and coaches. Even the NCAA is ques
tioning the Bowl games.
Stanford has had a tremendously successful year.
Yet., if Stanford would really make athletic history,
it could do so by taking the lead in de-emphasizing
post season games; by going on record as declining the
Bowl bid on matters of principle.
Now Stanford has the opportunity of being remem
bered not for the school that went to the Rose Bowl,
but as the school that contributed so much to bringing
the game back to the campuses.
Perhaps this is too idealistic in view of financial
gain, alum pride and student enthusiasm . . . But it. is
a view which docs prevail, and is hereby submitted.
