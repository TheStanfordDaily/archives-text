# No 'Typed' Grads, says Dils
## 
### DAVE SEELEY 
"Today there are no stereo
typed college men, contrary to
what Time quoted me as say
ing," stated Eugene Dils, head of
the Placement Service, in a re
rent interview.
Graduating students could not be
classified into specific groups be
cause job seeking is always differ
ent; cach individual has his own
motives in choosing an employer,
Dils added.
"A time of crisis," said Dils, "is a
time of opportunity." That is what
tic graduating engineers arc find
out today. But before they do
interested in a career, students
want to complete their work, even
tliough there is the constant prcs-
Hliirc from the Draft Board.
Dils likened this situation to the
Iflisition of the high school senior
leagued by offers from a big league
baseball club. All students, no mat
ter whether in col lege or in high

school, want to complete their
training and education before de
ciding seriously about a job.
No Decisions
The trend now is for students to
look and investigate different pros
pects without making a definite de
cision. The advantages of this are
that the prospective employee gains
knowledge and experience through
talking with these representatives,
as well as building up his confi
dence in himself through speaking
with others and being able to as
sert his ideas in front of them.
Last year the attitude toward em
ployment and the draft situation
was completely different than it is
now. Then students dropped out of
school to enlist, but now they are
accepting the times for what they
are. They arc adopting the policy of
accomplishing an objective and
hoping for a future that is holding
more promise for them than last
year.
The men today arc not pessimistic
about the draft, due to the fact that
constructive and progressive feel

ing is being whipped up against this
fatalistic idea of eventual Army
service. '"The boys will meet the
hurdles when they come to them,"
said Dils.
Fallacy Dispelled
Concluding his interview, Dils
dispelled the common fallacy that
there is more rapid advancement
and higher pay in a small firm. In a
small company a man has several
jobs, instead of one specialized one,
whereas in the large corporations
he has one definitely assigned posi
tion, and there is more rapid pro
motion with higher salaries.
The thing every man wants in
his job is opportunity and responsi
bility through directing activities
and having people under his con
trol.
In summation, Dils said that the
student today is much more steady
and down-to-earth about what he
is doing and planning for the future.
He is keeping his eyes open con
cerning the draft and the opportu
nities open to him, and is hoping for
a happy outcome.
