# Political Actions Attacked
## 
### DAVID WONG 
Charges of corruption in gov
ernment have occupied the
headlines of the nation's news
papers for some time. While
many such charges are un
doubtedly politically motivated,
others have served to point out
certain shortcomings in the ad
ministrative system.
In the opinion of one expert in
government administration, Dr. Rob
ert A. Walker, the putting into effect
of the recommendations of the Hoo
ver Commission would go a long way
towards overcoming some of the de
fects.
In an interview, Dr. Walker, as
sociate professor of Political Sci
cncc at Stanford, said that a cer
tain amount of corruption undoubt
edly does exist and that the public
should he vigilant. However, he
pointed out that charges of corrup

tion often concern agencies which
arc not under direct administrative
control.
He cited the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation as an example.
Since the RFC is under a board which
is not directly responsible to the
President, the President cannot be
held responsible for what goes on
within the RFC as he is held respon
sible for what goes on in other de
partments with heads appointed by
him.
The Hoover Commission recom
mended the transfer of the RFC to
the Treasury to be placed under a
single administrator who is directly
responsible to the President. But both
the RFC and the elements in Con
gress most critical of the Administra
tion have opposed this move.
Another government agency un
der fire is the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, which is one of the prin
ciple agencies remaining in which
officials arc appointed for political
reasons rather than through the
Civil Scrvicc. The Hoover Commis

sion has recommended that all such
officials be placed under (he Civil
Service, but that has also not been
done.
Continuing, Dr. Walker said that
often actions pointed to as corruption
are really routine ways of conducting
business in the White House and the
legislature. For example, both the
White House and Congress receive
a great many letters making all sorts
of inquiries. Such letters are referred
to the agencies concerned with cover
ing letters asking for consideration
to be given to the matters involved.
Such letters are routine and they
mean nothing, Dr. Walker said. How
ever, when one such letter is pulled
out from the many and quoted it
creates the impression that special
favors are being asked.
In conclusion, I)r. Walker said
that unsubstantiated charges of
corruption only serve to undermine
the confidence of the public in the
Administration and at the same
time make recruiting of good people
for government more difficult.

der fire is the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, which is one of the prin
ciple agencies remaining in which
officials arc appointed for political
reasons rather than through the
Civil Scrvicc. The Hoover Commis

sion has recommended that all such
officials be placed under (he Civil
Service, but that has also not been
done.
Continuing, Dr. Walker said that
often actions pointed to as corruption
are really routine ways of conducting
business in the White House and the
legislature. For example, both the
White House and Congress receive
a great many letters making all sorts
of inquiries. Such letters are referred
to the agencies concerned with cover
ing letters asking for consideration
to be given to the matters involved.
Such letters are routine and they
mean nothing, Dr. Walker said. How
ever, when one such letter is pulled
out from the many and quoted it
creates the impression that special
favors are being asked.
In conclusion, I)r. Walker said
that unsubstantiated charges of
corruption only serve to undermine
the confidence of the public in the
Administration and at the same
time make recruiting of good people
for government more difficult.
Charges of corruption in gov
ernment have occupied the
headlines of the nation's news
papers for some time. While
many such charges are un
doubtedly politically motivated,
others have served to point out
certain shortcomings in the ad
ministrative system.
In the opinion of one expert in
government administration, Dr. Rob
ert A. Walker, the putting into effect
of the recommendations of the Hoo
ver Commission would go a long way
towards overcoming some of the de
fects.
In an interview, Dr. Walker, as
sociate professor of Political Sci
cncc at Stanford, said that a cer
tain amount of corruption undoubt
edly does exist and that the public
should he vigilant. However, he
pointed out that charges of corrup

tion often concern agencies which
arc not under direct administrative
control.
He cited the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation as an example.
Since the RFC is under a board which
is not directly responsible to the
President, the President cannot be
held responsible for what goes on
within the RFC as he is held respon
sible for what goes on in other de
partments with heads appointed by
him.
The Hoover Commission recom
mended the transfer of the RFC to
the Treasury to be placed under a
single administrator who is directly
responsible to the President. But both
the RFC and the elements in Con
gress most critical of the Administra
tion have opposed this move.
