# THE 						DU PONT DIGEST
## M.E.'s AT DU PONT [3] Plant engineering and production supervision offer interesting careers for science graduates 
### 
In the past two issues of the Digest
you've read of the broad opportuni
ties that are offered meehanieal en
gineers in researeh and development
work at Du Pont.
This month let's look at oppor
tunities for men interested in any
of the branches of plant engineering
—such as maintenance, power, design
and construction —or in production
supervision.
Efficient maintenance is an impor
tant cost factor in the continuous
processes of a modern chemical in
dustry. The M.E. is called upon to
diagnose troubles, work out correc
tive measures, and supervise repairs.
Frequently he increases produc
tion by developing preventive main
tenance measures. So vital is this
work that in one division of the Com
pany, 500 men of all crafts, along
with a routine maintenance group,
sjxmd almost all their time on it.
One example of the problems fac
ing Du Pont engineers is the main

tcnance of pumps made to tolerances
of 0.0001" and operating at pressures
up to 6000 p.s.i.

In power work, also, problems re
quiring application of mechanical en
gineering principles arise. For in
stance, a metal required in one chem
ical process is melted at 800° F. by
immersion heaters fired by butane,
which is expensive. Conversion to
fuel oil presented the problem of
complete combustion in the immer
sion chamber. Du Pont M.E.'s re
designed the heaters so combustion

could be complete and the hot gases
recycled in water to use all the avail
able heat.
In design and construction of
chemical plants, mechanical engi
neering again is of major importance
because of the wide variety of plant s
built and intricacy of their equip
ment. Engineers collect basic data,
design and select equipment. They
also supervise many steps of con
struction until the plant is operating.

Production supervision attracts many
mechanical engineers. Men who have
the ability and interest usually move
into it by one or two routes: they ac
quire background on all stages of a
plant's operations by helping design
the plant, or by operating on the job;

Sometimes students of mechanical en
gineering feel that in a chemical com
pany they will be overshadowed by
chemical personnel. This is not the case
at Du Pont. Here, hundreds of adminis
trators and supervisors, up to the rank
of vice-president, started as M.E.'s.
