## Cards Just Didn't Have Winning Stuff 
### PETE GROTHE 
Our team had that day that every team has sooner or later."
Those words, spoken by Line Coach Joe Ruetz, told part of the
story of Stanford's 20 to 7 defeat at the hands of Cal. Chuck Tay
lor elaborated when he said, "We've always had our fair share of
the breaks, and we've been able to capitalize on those breaks. To-

day, we didn't get any, and Cal took
advantage of the ones it got."

Taylor (and the members of the
team) were not terribly downcast.
They realized that on this given day
Cal deserved to win. There were no
excuses. As a matter of fact, Taylor
looked like a man who for the first
time this year had the pressure taken
off.
Taylor continued, "I think Cal has
a very good team and controlled the
ball well. However, I still think we
have a very fine team. I'm proud of
the way they played this year. I had
supreme confid<#ice we'd win right
up to the end. I guess it was a sense
of false security after the job those
kids have done this year."
Trainer Connie Jan's, an indis
pensable part of Stanford's foot
hall organization, explained, "Over
an emotional season like our team
has played, there has bound to be
some letdown. We came up for the
Michigan game; we reached our
heights against SC. It was too much

to expect to reach those levels
again."
Pappy Waldorf agreed. The Big
One, shifting the stub of a cigar in his
mouth, said, "Stanford probably
didn't play their best game today,
and I can understand it. When a
team is keyed up for nine straight, it
is difficult to reach a fever pitch for
the tenth, Big Game or not.
"I know, I've been through it. There
is a limit to nervous reserve. Stan
ford had a hard schedule. Because
we lost two, we were extremely high
for this one. In this respect, we had
the advantage."
Asked whether Stanford had a
good chance to top Illinois in the
Rose Bowl, I'appy harrumphed,
You're darn tootin they have. No
one is going to stop that Kcrkorian
to McColl combination. 1 don't
know much about Illinois, but
Stanford has very dangerous wea
pons and will give a good account of
itself in the Hose Bowl.
'"I was very pleased with my de
fense. Any time you hold Stanford
to one touchdown, you're doing good.
Thirteen men carried the whole load.
I especially liked Hazeltine, Norris,
Bartlett, Ely, and Mering.
"Yes, in my 27 years of coaching,
I've never enjoyed a victory like I've
enjoyed this one."
Gary Kerkorian summed up the
feeling of the players when he said,
"They were better than we were to
day. But that doesn't mean they have
a better team."
Many alumni and well-wishers
came in to congratulate Chuck
Taylor on his great season. Taylor
smiled slightly as lie said, "They
played their hearts out. those kids.
This lust wasn't our day."

day, we didn't get any, and Cal took
advantage of the ones it got."

Taylor (and the members of the
team) were not terribly downcast.
They realized that on this given day
Cal deserved to win. There were no
excuses. As a matter of fact, Taylor
looked like a man who for the first
time this year had the pressure taken
off.
Taylor continued, "I think Cal has
a very good team and controlled the
ball well. However, I still think we
have a very fine team. I'm proud of
the way they played this year. I had
supreme confid<#ice we'd win right
up to the end. I guess it was a sense
of false security after the job those
kids have done this year."
Trainer Connie Jan's, an indis
pensable part of Stanford's foot
hall organization, explained, "Over
an emotional season like our team
has played, there has bound to be
some letdown. We came up for the
Michigan game; we reached our
heights against SC. It was too much

to expect to reach those levels
again."
Pappy Waldorf agreed. The Big
One, shifting the stub of a cigar in his
mouth, said, "Stanford probably
didn't play their best game today,
and I can understand it. When a
team is keyed up for nine straight, it
is difficult to reach a fever pitch for
the tenth, Big Game or not.
"I know, I've been through it. There
is a limit to nervous reserve. Stan
ford had a hard schedule. Because
we lost two, we were extremely high
for this one. In this respect, we had
the advantage."
Asked whether Stanford had a
good chance to top Illinois in the
Rose Bowl, I'appy harrumphed,
You're darn tootin they have. No
one is going to stop that Kcrkorian
to McColl combination. 1 don't
know much about Illinois, but
Stanford has very dangerous wea
pons and will give a good account of
itself in the Hose Bowl.
'"I was very pleased with my de
fense. Any time you hold Stanford
to one touchdown, you're doing good.
Thirteen men carried the whole load.
I especially liked Hazeltine, Norris,
Bartlett, Ely, and Mering.
"Yes, in my 27 years of coaching,
I've never enjoyed a victory like I've
enjoyed this one."
Gary Kerkorian summed up the
feeling of the players when he said,
"They were better than we were to
day. But that doesn't mean they have
a better team."
Many alumni and well-wishers
came in to congratulate Chuck
Taylor on his great season. Taylor
smiled slightly as lie said, "They
played their hearts out. those kids.
This lust wasn't our day."
Our team had that day that every team has sooner or later."
Those words, spoken by Line Coach Joe Ruetz, told part of the
story of Stanford's 20 to 7 defeat at the hands of Cal. Chuck Tay
lor elaborated when he said, "We've always had our fair share of
the breaks, and we've been able to capitalize on those breaks. To-

day, we didn't get any, and Cal took
advantage of the ones it got."
