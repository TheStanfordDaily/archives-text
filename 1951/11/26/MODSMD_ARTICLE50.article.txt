Bonfire Rally
The coaching staff, team members,
and such Stanford immortals as Er
nie Nevers spoke at Thursday's
Bonfire Rally before the crowd
watched a damp, slow-starting pyre
go up in flames. Jim Triolo, '35.
emceed Friday night's Indian Hunt
ing Ceremony, holding his audience
fascinated with a colorful history of

the Axe.
The promise of rain Saturday
failed to materialize and the out
door dedications and alumni lunch
eon proceeded as scheduled. How
ever, dark clouds prompted Stan
ford rooters to carry raincoats,
which drooped from their arms as
they left the Stadium solemn and
unhappy at Cal's touchdown bar
rage.
It was a stunned and at times bit
ter rooting section which watched
the Indians suffer their first defeat
of the season. "What's wrong?" was
the cry when the Bears rolled down
the field; ''That's the way they used
to look" when the Cards showed a
few yards' sparkle. "We're going to
the Rose Bowl" was their main re
tort to Cal's victory chants.
Makes History
The game marked the first time
in the history of the rivalry that a
Stanford team has lost a Big Game
in the year following a tie contest.
And it also continued the Big Red's
losing string in Stanford Stadium.

Stanford has not won a Big Game
on its home grounds since 1935.
While marking the first defeat for
a Chuck Taylor-coachcd team, the
game paralleled the Indians' season
two years ago. At that time, the
Cards went south and reached the
heights of glory scalping USC, only
to come back and be outclassed by
the rivals from across the Bay.
Again Saturday, the newsreel
jinx prevailed. Two years ago be
fore the Michigan game, the news
reel cameramen asked Farm root
ers to cheer as if the Big Red had
just scored a touchdown. The root
ers complied. Michigan won.
"Remember Michigan"
In the 49 Big Game, the same re
quest was made, but in defiance of
the cameramen, the rooters chanted
"We remember Michigan." As
chance would have it, just then the
Stanford JV's scored a touchdown,
the students cheered . . . and the
cameras rolled. California won.
Saturday, the newsreel cameras
rolled again.
Phi Sigma Kappa's house dec

to look" when the Cards showed a
few yards' sparkle. "We're going to
the Rose Bowl" was their main re
tort to Cal's victory chants.
Makes History
The game marked the first time
in the history of the rivalry that a
Stanford team has lost a Big Game
in the year following a tie contest.
And it also continued the Big Red's
losing string in Stanford Stadium.

Stanford has not won a Big Game
on its home grounds since 1935.
While marking the first defeat for
a Chuck Taylor-coachcd team, the
game paralleled the Indians' season
two years ago. At that time, the
Cards went south and reached the
heights of glory scalping USC, only
to come back and be outclassed by
the rivals from across the Bay.
Again Saturday, the newsreel
jinx prevailed. Two years ago be
fore the Michigan game, the news
reel cameramen asked Farm root
ers to cheer as if the Big Red had
just scored a touchdown. The root
ers complied. Michigan won.
"Remember Michigan"
In the 49 Big Game, the same re
quest was made, but in defiance of
the cameramen, the rooters chanted
"We remember Michigan." As
chance would have it, just then the
Stanford JV's scored a touchdown,
the students cheered . . . and the
cameras rolled. California won.
Saturday, the newsreel cameras
rolled again.
Phi Sigma Kappa's house dec
orations were named the sweep
stakes winner Saturday in judg
ing which was part of the fifth

The promise of rain Saturday
failed to materialize and the out

ever, dark clouds prompted Stan

which drooped from their arms as
they left the Stadium solemn and
unhappy at Cal's touchdown bar
rage.
It was a stunned and at times bit
ter rooting section which watched
the Indians suffer their first defeat
of the season. "What's wrong?" was
the cry when the Bears rolled down
the field; ''That's the way they used
to look" when the Cards showed a
