# New Treatment Protects Pillars Against Weather
## 
### 
The strange substance that has
been applied to several pillars cn the
Stanford quad and has made many
people curious as to just what it is,
serves two purposes: to act as water
proofing and to prevent parts of the
buildings from deteriorating.
The waterproofing treatment has
been used on many of the foundations
of the pillars on the quad and on
several fixtures that showed signs of
falling apart. Because these build*
ings have not been adequately treated
against the elements for such a
time, a special solution was swabbed
on the Weathered surfaces. The stuff
is supposed to be transparent, but it
doesn't look like it's going to turn
out that way.
