# Tower Puzzle Still Unsolved
## 
### 
Police investigations yesterday
eliminated the possibility of the
Hoover Tower having been broken
into over Big Game weekend. Clos
er inspection also showed that what
had appeared to be a red and white
pennant is actually several red
streamers attached in some way to
the short flagpole on top of the
tower.
A white banner, possibly with
writing or other markings on it, is
on the west side of the top dome.
The riddles of who did it and how
it was done remain unsolved. The
elimination of the inside job the
ory, as established by the police in
vestigation, leaves the possibility of
ihe use of a helicopter. If the mark
ings on the banner can be identified,
they may provide hints as to who
(Cal students or Stanford students
and possibly neither) engineered the
job.
