# Stanford Profs Help Write Book
## 
### 
Two Stanford scholars, Professor
Jack A. Posin of the Asiatic-Slavic
Studies Department, and Bayard Q.
Morgan, professor of German emer
itus, have written chapters in a new
text, "The World Through Litera
ture," published recently by Ap
pJeton-Century-Crofts, Inc., of New
York.
The publishers describe it as "a
core text in world literature courses
or as a supplementary book for
courses in general literature and
world civilization."
Professor Posin devotes his essay
on Slavic literature almost exclu
sively to Russian literature. Pro
fessor Morgan, in his chapter on
German literature, sought to inter
pret German literature as an ex
pression of the German national
character.
The editor of this integrated
group of critical analyses of great
world literatures is Charlton Laird
of the University of Nevada.
