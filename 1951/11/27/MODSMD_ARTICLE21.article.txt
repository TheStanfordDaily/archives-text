nist delegates, meeting in Panmun
jom in their first plenary session
since Oct. 25, quickly ratified the
agreement that could mean the end

Christmas holidays.
Three Points Remain
Location of the truce line was the
No. 2 item on the armistice agenda.
Three more points remain to be set
tled before there can be peace in

full of thorny problems which make
the future uncertain.

in effect for .'5O days was decided
upon in a 7 V2-hour meeting yester
day of Allied anil Communist staff
