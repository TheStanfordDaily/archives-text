# Extended Parking Area Is Planned
## 
### 
If the gods provide good weather,
the Corporation Yard will provide
increased parking space in the lot
across from Stern Hall come win
ter quarter for all students who
want to park but know not where.
The rock base was laid a week
arjo, but due to the Big Game ac
tivities, which drained the Corp
Yard of its trucks and crews, and
yesterday's rain, progress hat. been
impeded for the present. The lot,
which lies between Galvez and Al
varado streets, will be extended to
where tho. e same roads meet, thus
completing a large ti iangle.
Oil will be poured on the rock
base, followed by a surface of grav
el. When this process is completed,
students will be allowed to drive
over the gravel to smooth it down.
As soon as the surface is smooth
enough, it will be swept clean of
gravel and white lines painted on it.
The whole process should cost
around $1,200, it is estimated. The
lot as it stands now holds some 250
cars; however, upon completion it
should accommodate 150 more. As
befoie, the entrance will be from
Galvez Street and the exit will be
on to Alv.ii ido Street
