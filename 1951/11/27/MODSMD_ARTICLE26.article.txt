# Indians In Rose Bowl: PCC Vote Unanimous
## Illinois to Represent Big Ten In Cards' Ninth Bowl Attempt 
### 
It's official.
Stanford was chosen to represent the Pacific Coast Conference
in the Hose Bowl Jan. 1 by a unanimous vote of the conference's
nine member schools yesterday. The Big Ten selected unbeaten,
once-tied Illinois as their representative earlier. Neither choice

came as a surprise.
Stanford sewed up its invitation
10 Jays ago when it defeated Ore
gon State. Saturday's loss to C.il
did not affect the PCC standings.
Illinois sneaked into the Big
Ten throne by edging by North
western Saturday, 3-0, to clinch
the invitation. This will be the
second trip to the post - season
classic for the Illini, who slaugh
tered UCLA, 45-11, in 1!M(».
For the Indians, it will be their
ninth trip. They have a Hose Bowl
record of three wins, four losses,
and a tie. Stanford met Michigan
in the first Hose Bowl game on Jan.
1, 1902, and was thumped, 49-0.
Since then the Indians lost to Notre
Dame in 1925, 10-27; tied Alabama,
7-7, in 1927; edged Pittsburgh, 7-ti,
in 1923; lost to Columbia, 0-7, in an
upset in 1934; lost to Alabama, 13-
29, in 1935; beat Southern Metho
dist, 7-0, in 193G; and took Nebras
ka, 21-13, in 1941, climaxing a per
fect season by the "Wow Boys."
Coach Ray Eliot of Illinois will
send a solid club to the bowl, led
by All-American candidate Johnny
Karras.
This season the club opened the
schedule with a 27-13 victory over
UCLA, PCC runner-up. Then
week by week the Illini rolled
over the opposition —14-10 over
Wisconsin, 41-20 over Syracuse,
27-20 over Washington, and 21-0
over Indiana. About that time
the offensive tailed off some, but
the defense took up the slack.
Eliot's boys squeaked by Michi
gan, 7-0, and ripped lowa, 40-13.
They were held to a 0-0 lie by
Ohio State and then eased by
Northwestern Saturday, 3-0 —
which means the team hasn't
scored a touchdown in its last two
games.
To Stanford will fall the task of
supplying the Coast's first victory
over the Big Ten since the series
began in 1947, the year Illinois beat
UCLA.
For the first time hi four year?,
the PCC will be represented by a
defeated team. However, perfect
records haven't meant anything to
the Big Ten clubs during that time
—as they won them all.
