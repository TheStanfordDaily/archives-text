# Pre-Reg Stumbling Blocks
## 
### 
The usual rush of upper division students
trying to pre-reg early wasn't helped any by
the delay in distributing time schedules. Sched
ules were not available before yesterday, the
first day of pre-regging.
Most students like to have the opportunity
to look over time schedules thoroughly before
deciding on a study list. Better participation in
the pre-reg program would result if time sched
ules were made available two or three days be
fore pre-registration.
Another weak spot in pre-registration con
cerns office hours for advisers. Many students
would like to talk over study problems for more
than just a brief minute or two between sig
natures. This is impossible during the crowded
two-day pre-registration program, but could be
accomplished with more ease during the quar
ter if advisers had sensible office hours.
Too often a student clambers up to the third
floor of history corner or some such spot only to
sec a tiny card on the doorâ€”M-Th, 8:30-9:15.
Professors should have at least three hours a
week and usually more in which they will be on
hand for students to consult. What's the use of
an adviser system if advisers don't have time
to give advice?
Also, too many Frosh and Sophs have
had their entire study programs stymied be
cause of disinterested and faulty advice. The
problem boils down to the fact that advisers
don't know th#*ir t"' arges well enough, and are
not given enough time to learn to know them.

Consequently, they can give only meager help.
As a result of a study conducted last year by
the Student - Faculty Education Commission,
Registrar Harvey Hall is now working on a
plan to improve the adviser system. Advisers
have been given handbooks and information
on all departments which will aid them in help
ing students. It's a significant step forward.
