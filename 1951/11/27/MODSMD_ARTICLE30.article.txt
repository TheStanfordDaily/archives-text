The "buy at Stanford, pick up at Pasadena"
plan for rooters' tickets has been discarded for
a "trust the students" plan. Rose Bowl rooter
tickets will go on sale here soon, and students
will pick up the ticket at the time of purchase.
Athletic Director A 1 Masters, in announcing
the distribution plans, asked for the coopera
tion of all students in stopping scalping of root
ers' tickets. The Stanford Athletic Director also
reserved the right to check all rooters for stu
dent body cards at the Rose Bowl gates.
The big loss from wholesale scalping of root
ers' tickets would be to the rooting section any
way. If gray haired old men and grandmas
worm into the section, it's a cinch the cheering
will suffer. Non - students might even have
trouble with the card stunts!
Masters also asked for student cooperation
in the business of parents' tickets. A limited
number of tickets for parents will be sold, but
they will be for parents only.
