### DICK McLEAN 
SUGGESTION DAY
The following ai • s group of suggestions thai I think
would make Stanford a finer university. I have given
all of these ideas much thought and serious considera
tion. So in my second attempt at reform for the quarter
I suggest:
1) Change Ihe school colors to black. This notion
may startle you at first glance, hut just think how it
would look.
The team would wear shiny black helmets and mid
night. colored uniforms. The numbers would be in
black so that the enemy team would never know which
backfield man had the ball. On muddy days when
else looked sloppy, think how snappy Stan
- ford would look.

In the fourth quarter, the quar
ter that counts, when the sun dips
beneath the rim of the stadium and
* the long shadows trickle across
the field, our team would be per
fectly camouflaged. If Chuck were
unscrupulous, he could l>ootlcg an
extra eleven men on the turf.
Wouldn't it. be a kick to unleash
our offensive AND defensive team
on an opponent at the same time.
We'd block and tackle them all at

once. Why with that ma.«y men we could take care of
the referees too.
The rooting sections would look great, too. The
girls would wear black skirts and sweaters. Maybe
black stockings too? In case it got cold or rained,
cacli coed would bring her motorcycle jacket. Dur
ing the card stunts Jhe blondes would have to wear
bandannas. And to top it off every girl could wave
a black pompom.
The men's rooting section would look like one of
Mussolini's Youth Rallies. Every man in his black
shirt. Even the saddle shoes would be ink covercd.
From across the field the combined sections would look.
Like a huge cavity in the stadium.
We'd dress the band in black as well. Of course if
we did this, we'd have to slow down their chop step
and make them play slower picces. But. imagine thy
psychological impact on the opposing team and rooters,
when our band slowly filed in playing "Gloomy Sun
xlay or "Dies Irac." If they played at enough funerals
and things, they might get enough to buy an organ.
The name "Stanford Indians" would have to be
c hanged too. We could call ourselves the "Stanford
Pirates" or the "Blackjacks' or even "The Lcland
Stanford U. Midnight Mauradcrs."

So for a hundred years of winning football teams,
extra revenue for the school and a really sharp rooting
section, let's kiss ofT this gaudy red and white stuff and
get something really colorful like black.
2) Let's change the academic setup around here.
(Have you noticed the pressure of midterms and the
distant thunder of finals?) My suggestion is to end
all this psychosis-making tension and have no more
finals, no midterms, no homework, no cinch notices,
no term papers, no classes.
We'd still have grades though. We'd have a quarterly
lottery for the marks. (What arc grades but a grab
bag at best?) There would be no worry, no strain.
At the end of each quarter the class would meet for
ibc first time and draw the grades out of a giant punch
bowl. (They'd have to drink the punch first.) By the
time the bottom of the bowl was reached and the
grades given out, nobody would care anyway. Every
person regardless of intelligence quotient and back
ground would have an equal chance at the "A's." Tins
is democracy. This is the American way. This is the
Stanford way—equality.
Think of the good this would do for the professors.
No tests to correct. No sleepy classes to try to prod
into stimulating thought. If this plan once got rolling,
it would sweep the country. (I must admit that this
scheme is currently being tried out at UC and USC.
They arc finding it hugely successful.)
The typical Stanford student day would begin about
10:30 in the morning. No rush to classes. No last
minute cramming. Just roll out of bed and stroll down
stairs for a leisurely breakfast. After breakfast every
one would go back to bed and just doze until 1:30.
After a warm shower and lunch at 2:15 the day would
begin in earnest.
The campus could play volley hall, swim al the
lake, go boating, drink coffee at the Cellar, or stand
in the library lobby and just "sosh" until dinner.
Every evening would be a combination of the Satur
day after we heat USC and Big (lame Nite. (1
thought I heard a gong strike in my head as I wrote
the words "Big (lame Party." Strange!)
I talked this idea over with President Sterling one
afternoon last week. He thought it was a splendid .sug
gestion but said tuition would still have to be $220 a
quarter. But who cares? We're all rich.
Congratulations to our Big Red Machine for a great
scrson.
Good luck on the midterms and finals.
I've got. to knock ofT this writing BULL SESSIONS
at 3 o'clock in the morning. The damnedest things
come out on the page.
