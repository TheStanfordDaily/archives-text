## 'No Bowl Like the Rose Bowl' 
### 
To the Editor:
We cooked up this song about going to the Hose
Howl to the tune of "There's No Business Like Show
Business.". We sang it in the Lagunita dining room
recently.
"There's no howl like the Rose Howl,
I-ike no howl I know;
Everything about it is appealing.
Everything that football will allow;
No where will you get thai happy ferling,

When we arc stealing (hat extra down.
There's no team like the Card team,
Like no team I know;
Yesterday they told us we would not go far,
We're once defeated and under par,
Off to I'asadena where the Roses arc;
Eel's go on to Ihe BOWL."
