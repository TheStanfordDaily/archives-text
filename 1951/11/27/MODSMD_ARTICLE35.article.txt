# 'American in Paris' Hits Musical Jackpot
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Take Gene Kelly and the songs of Ira and George Gershwin, mix
well with one screen play by Alan Jay Lerner, add a host of tal
ented actors, singers, and dancers, toss with Technicolor, and what
have you?
"An American in Paris, which, as served up by those prize chefs,

producer Arthur Freed and direc
tor Vincente Minnelli, emerges as
nothing less than the tastiest morsel
the musical screen has ever known.
The climactic 17 Mj - minute "An
American in Paris Ballet" is itself

enough to ensure
the picture a
permanent niche
in screen history.
With all the ar
tistry yet none of
the heavy-hand
e d artiness, of
"The lied Shoes"
and "Tales of
Hoffman," it is

a n experience
which everybody owes himself.
The ballet, choreographed by
Gene Kelly, tells the story of a
young man meeting, enjoying, and
losing his love. As his moods fluc
tuate, the scene changes, flowing
from one appropriate conception of
Paris 1o another. The subject mat
ter and styles of six French painters
(e.g., Dufy, Renoir, Lautrec) have
been carried out with unspeakable
fidelity in every detail of each
scene. The result is sheer genius.

Gershwin Songs
But. that isn't all. For example,
the Gershwins' songs, some familiar,
some you've never heard before,
but each presented here with a
charm and spontaneity far too sel
dom seen in musicals. From the
sparkling new version of "I Got
Rhythm" to the haunting "Our Love
Is Here to Stay," from "Tra-la-la"
to "I'll Build a Stairway to Para
dise," all arc great.
And there is Gene Kelly, at the
peak of his illustrious career, danc
ing with his own discovery, gamine
like Leslie Caron. Miss Caron
proves herself the most cngaginc

newcomer to the musical screen in
years. Furthermore, there are
Georges Guetary, who has easily as
much of the old Gallic charm as
Chevalier ever had; Nina Foch, who
brings real depth to what could
have been a trite part; and Oscar
Levant, who for once is really hi
larious.
In sum, "An American in Paris"
is a picture nobody should miss.
From start to finish, it is pure
magic. In the words of George's
brother Ira, "Who could ask for
anything more?"
