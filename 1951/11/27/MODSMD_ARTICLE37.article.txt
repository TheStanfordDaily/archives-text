it used to be our custom to go around strangling persons who said "Wait
till next year." But that's what we're going to say right now, "Wait till next
year."
No, we don't mean next November 21 when we meet Cal again. We
mean next year . . . the beginning of it—January first. Stanford is faeed
with a golden opportunity for revenge. It can do what Cal had been unable
to do in the last three years—beat the Big Ten opponent in the llose Bowl.
Does Stanford stand a good chance of topping the Illini? "You're darn
tootin'," says Pappy Waldorf, a man who has been unsuccessful in thwart
ing the Big Ten challenge the last three years.

Wally Cruicc, who scouted Stan
ford for Illinois, opined that Stanford
would be a tougher team because of
the loss. Says Cruice, "The Indians'
apparent letdown was probably
caused because they already knew
they were a cinch for the Rose Bowl.
I was very impressed with Bob Ma
thias and Bill McColl. Both arc pro
fessionals in ability."
Yesterday, we went straight to the
man who would know the most about
Illinois, defensive backfield coach
George Lynn. Lynn occupied him
self for a football hour two Satur
days ago by scouting Illinois against
Ohio State. The game ended in a tic
and it allowed Lynn to see all the
pet Illinois plays. The fighting Illini
pulled all stops and showed Lynn
everything but their scoring plays.
For the record', Illinois didn't score.

In regard to the Indians' chances, Lynn said, "After Saturday's game,
wc stand a much better chance than we did before. We're going down to
beat Illinois. If the kids had any delusions of grandeur, they had it taken
out of them last Saturday. They realize that they're going to have to go
out and work for their touchdowns. Our team played and beat Michigan
and know what kind of ball they play in the Big Ten. Illinois will be the
toughest team we've faccd, but as I say, we're going down to beat Illinois.
The top Illinois threat is Johnny Karras, an All-American left half.
The 171 pound Karras is not particularly powerful, but he is a speed mer
chant and can stop 011 a dime and leave nine cents in change. He is also
a dangerous pass receiver. However, it's not true that if you stop Karras, |
you stop Illinois. The team from Champaign-Urbana has other weapons, j
They have ground-gobbling runners in half Don Stevens, a five-nine Negro j
scooter, and Bill Tate, 1S7 pound fullback. The quarterback, Tom O'Con
ncll, Lynn rates as almost Kerkorian's equal. Kerkorian is a sharper
passer than O'Conncll but cannot wiggle out of a hole like the Illinois
signal-caller.
The Midwestern challengers, incidentally, adhere strictly to the platoon J
system and use a straight "T" formation, sometimes with flankers and some- j
times with a spread.
Ends Rex Smith and Joseph Vcrnasco arc top receivers and linebackers
Elie Popa and Charles Borcrio arc outstanding. Two other defensive sore
thumb stickouts arc tacklc Marvin Bcrschct and safety A1 Brosky. Offen
sively, guard Charles Studclcy (191) and tackle Chuck Ulrich (219) arc
demon blockers.
Lynn rates Stanford's ends, offensive and defensive, as superior to Illinois'.
Ray Elliot's tackles have an edge 011 Stanford's while the guards are equal.
Lynn allows, however, that Illinois has nothing to compare with Manoogian.
Illinois' centers and linebackers have a slight edge on Stanford's, and the
Orange and White has more offensive and defensive backfield speed. How
ever, the Illini don't have as powerful runners as Stanford does and don't
have the sure pass defenders and tacklers that the Indian defensive back
field boasts. As far as reliability is concerned, Illinois doesn't have any
thing to compare with Dick Horn. If Horn isn't an Ail-American defender,
wc don't know who is.
The Big Ten champs are a well-balanced team and rely mainly on their
ground game. However, when they were in a tight spot, they beat Wash
ington, Michigan, and Wisconsin on passing. Their defense outshines their
offense, though. It is solid.
This leaves the question, "How are We going to beat Illinois?" One.
our defense should be able to limit their offense. The Illini have had a lot
of trouble scoring the past several games. Two, the Illini can be had. They
arc vulnerable on short passes, 011 off-tackle plays, and on trap plays.
Also, they've never met an opponent of McColl's caliber yet, and Eric
Southwood, Tsar Calfce, and Gordy Rice will all he healthy by January
first. iVIathias and Hugasian were not at full effectiveness last Saturday,
and with Southwood (whom many call Stanford's best runner), Mathias,
III igasian. Meyers, Cook, and Laubscher all in good shape, the Indians may
have a two-pronged attack that will he tough to handle.
The Cards will keep in shape individually until December 16 when they
will start, practice again. They will work out at Stanford until Christmas
at which time they will go home for the holiday and may re-gather at
Arrowhead Springs Hotel the day after Christinas. Chuck Taylor's crew
will work out there until January first. January first . . . next year . . .
they will beat Illinois in the Rose Bowl.
Just wait, till next year.

have a two-pronged attack that will he tough to handle.
The Cards will keep in shape individually until December 16 when they
will start, practice again. They will work out at Stanford until Christmas
at which time they will go home for the holiday and may re-gather at
Arrowhead Springs Hotel the day after Christinas. Chuck Taylor's crew
will work out there until January first. January first . . . next year . . .
they will beat Illinois in the Rose Bowl.
Just wait, till next year.


GEORGE LYNN
it used to be our custom to go around strangling persons who said "Wait
till next year." But that's what we're going to say right now, "Wait till next
year."
No, we don't mean next November 21 when we meet Cal again. We
mean next year . . . the beginning of it—January first. Stanford is faeed
with a golden opportunity for revenge. It can do what Cal had been unable
to do in the last three years—beat the Big Ten opponent in the llose Bowl.
Does Stanford stand a good chance of topping the Illini? "You're darn
tootin'," says Pappy Waldorf, a man who has been unsuccessful in thwart
ing the Big Ten challenge the last three years.

Wally Cruicc, who scouted Stan
ford for Illinois, opined that Stanford
would be a tougher team because of
the loss. Says Cruice, "The Indians'
apparent letdown was probably
caused because they already knew
they were a cinch for the Rose Bowl.
I was very impressed with Bob Ma
thias and Bill McColl. Both arc pro
fessionals in ability."
Yesterday, we went straight to the
man who would know the most about
Illinois, defensive backfield coach
George Lynn. Lynn occupied him
self for a football hour two Satur
days ago by scouting Illinois against
Ohio State. The game ended in a tic
and it allowed Lynn to see all the
pet Illinois plays. The fighting Illini
pulled all stops and showed Lynn
everything but their scoring plays.
For the record', Illinois didn't score.

In regard to the Indians' chances, Lynn said, "After Saturday's game,
wc stand a much better chance than we did before. We're going down to
beat Illinois. If the kids had any delusions of grandeur, they had it taken
out of them last Saturday. They realize that they're going to have to go
out and work for their touchdowns. Our team played and beat Michigan
and know what kind of ball they play in the Big Ten. Illinois will be the
toughest team we've faccd, but as I say, we're going down to beat Illinois.
The top Illinois threat is Johnny Karras, an All-American left half.
The 171 pound Karras is not particularly powerful, but he is a speed mer
chant and can stop 011 a dime and leave nine cents in change. He is also
a dangerous pass receiver. However, it's not true that if you stop Karras, |
you stop Illinois. The team from Champaign-Urbana has other weapons, j
They have ground-gobbling runners in half Don Stevens, a five-nine Negro j
scooter, and Bill Tate, 1S7 pound fullback. The quarterback, Tom O'Con
ncll, Lynn rates as almost Kerkorian's equal. Kerkorian is a sharper
passer than O'Conncll but cannot wiggle out of a hole like the Illinois
signal-caller.
The Midwestern challengers, incidentally, adhere strictly to the platoon J
system and use a straight "T" formation, sometimes with flankers and some- j
times with a spread.
Ends Rex Smith and Joseph Vcrnasco arc top receivers and linebackers
Elie Popa and Charles Borcrio arc outstanding. Two other defensive sore
thumb stickouts arc tacklc Marvin Bcrschct and safety A1 Brosky. Offen
sively, guard Charles Studclcy (191) and tackle Chuck Ulrich (219) arc
demon blockers.
Lynn rates Stanford's ends, offensive and defensive, as superior to Illinois'.
Ray Elliot's tackles have an edge 011 Stanford's while the guards are equal.
Lynn allows, however, that Illinois has nothing to compare with Manoogian.
Illinois' centers and linebackers have a slight edge on Stanford's, and the
Orange and White has more offensive and defensive backfield speed. How
ever, the Illini don't have as powerful runners as Stanford does and don't
have the sure pass defenders and tacklers that the Indian defensive back
field boasts. As far as reliability is concerned, Illinois doesn't have any
thing to compare with Dick Horn. If Horn isn't an Ail-American defender,
wc don't know who is.
The Big Ten champs are a well-balanced team and rely mainly on their
ground game. However, when they were in a tight spot, they beat Wash
ington, Michigan, and Wisconsin on passing. Their defense outshines their
offense, though. It is solid.
This leaves the question, "How are We going to beat Illinois?" One.
our defense should be able to limit their offense. The Illini have had a lot
of trouble scoring the past several games. Two, the Illini can be had. They
arc vulnerable on short passes, 011 off-tackle plays, and on trap plays.
Also, they've never met an opponent of McColl's caliber yet, and Eric
Southwood, Tsar Calfce, and Gordy Rice will all he healthy by January
first. iVIathias and Hugasian were not at full effectiveness last Saturday,
and with Southwood (whom many call Stanford's best runner), Mathias,
III igasian. Meyers, Cook, and Laubscher all in good shape, the Indians may
have a two-pronged attack that will he tough to handle.

our defense should be able to limit their offense. The Illini have had a lot
of trouble scoring the past several games. Two, the Illini can be had. They
arc vulnerable on short passes, 011 off-tackle plays, and on trap plays.
Also, they've never met an opponent of McColl's caliber yet, and Eric
Southwood, Tsar Calfce, and Gordy Rice will all he healthy by January
first. iVIathias and Hugasian were not at full effectiveness last Saturday,
and with Southwood (whom many call Stanford's best runner), Mathias,
III igasian. Meyers, Cook, and Laubscher all in good shape, the Indians may
have a two-pronged attack that will he tough to handle.
The Cards will keep in shape individually until December 16 when they
will start, practice again. They will work out at Stanford until Christmas
at which time they will go home for the holiday and may re-gather at
Arrowhead Springs Hotel the day after Christinas. Chuck Taylor's crew
will work out there until January first. January first . . . next year . . .
they will beat Illinois in the Rose Bowl.
Just wait, till next year.

it used to be our custom to go around strangling persons who said "Wait
till next year." But that's what we're going to say right now, "Wait till next
year."
No, we don't mean next November 21 when we meet Cal again. We
mean next year . . . the beginning of it—January first. Stanford is faeed
with a golden opportunity for revenge. It can do what Cal had been unable
to do in the last three years—beat the Big Ten opponent in the llose Bowl.
Does Stanford stand a good chance of topping the Illini? "You're darn
tootin'," says Pappy Waldorf, a man who has been unsuccessful in thwart
ing the Big Ten challenge the last three years.

Wally Cruicc, who scouted Stan
ford for Illinois, opined that Stanford
would be a tougher team because of
the loss. Says Cruice, "The Indians'
apparent letdown was probably
caused because they already knew
they were a cinch for the Rose Bowl.
I was very impressed with Bob Ma
thias and Bill McColl. Both arc pro
fessionals in ability."
Yesterday, we went straight to the
man who would know the most about
Illinois, defensive backfield coach
George Lynn. Lynn occupied him
self for a football hour two Satur
days ago by scouting Illinois against
Ohio State. The game ended in a tic
and it allowed Lynn to see all the
pet Illinois plays. The fighting Illini
pulled all stops and showed Lynn
everything but their scoring plays.
For the record', Illinois didn't score.

In regard to the Indians' chances, Lynn said, "After Saturday's game,
wc stand a much better chance than we did before. We're going down to
beat Illinois. If the kids had any delusions of grandeur, they had it taken
out of them last Saturday. They realize that they're going to have to go
out and work for their touchdowns. Our team played and beat Michigan
and know what kind of ball they play in the Big Ten. Illinois will be the
toughest team we've faccd, but as I say, we're going down to beat Illinois.
The top Illinois threat is Johnny Karras, an All-American left half.
The 171 pound Karras is not particularly powerful, but he is a speed mer
chant and can stop 011 a dime and leave nine cents in change. He is also
a dangerous pass receiver. However, it's not true that if you stop Karras, |
you stop Illinois. The team from Champaign-Urbana has other weapons, j
They have ground-gobbling runners in half Don Stevens, a five-nine Negro j
scooter, and Bill Tate, 1S7 pound fullback. The quarterback, Tom O'Con
ncll, Lynn rates as almost Kerkorian's equal. Kerkorian is a sharper
passer than O'Conncll but cannot wiggle out of a hole like the Illinois
signal-caller.
The Midwestern challengers, incidentally, adhere strictly to the platoon J
system and use a straight "T" formation, sometimes with flankers and some- j
times with a spread.
Ends Rex Smith and Joseph Vcrnasco arc top receivers and linebackers
Elie Popa and Charles Borcrio arc outstanding. Two other defensive sore
thumb stickouts arc tacklc Marvin Bcrschct and safety A1 Brosky. Offen
sively, guard Charles Studclcy (191) and tackle Chuck Ulrich (219) arc
demon blockers.
Lynn rates Stanford's ends, offensive and defensive, as superior to Illinois'.
Ray Elliot's tackles have an edge 011 Stanford's while the guards are equal.
Lynn allows, however, that Illinois has nothing to compare with Manoogian.
Illinois' centers and linebackers have a slight edge on Stanford's, and the
Orange and White has more offensive and defensive backfield speed. How
ever, the Illini don't have as powerful runners as Stanford does and don't
have the sure pass defenders and tacklers that the Indian defensive back
field boasts. As far as reliability is concerned, Illinois doesn't have any
thing to compare with Dick Horn. If Horn isn't an Ail-American defender,
wc don't know who is.
The Big Ten champs are a well-balanced team and rely mainly on their
ground game. However, when they were in a tight spot, they beat Wash
ington, Michigan, and Wisconsin on passing. Their defense outshines their
offense, though. It is solid.
