SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 26 (UP)
—Coach Chuck Taylor of Stanford's
Rose Bowl Indians said today that
he has had scouts trailing Illinois
and Wisconsin for the last two Sat
urdays.
"We couldn't take a chance, so
we had to scout Wisconsin, too," he
said.
"We also expect to be able to get
pictures of the Illinois-Washington
and Illinois-UCLA games.
"I assume that Illinois will be
able to look at our Michigan-Stan
ford game pictures."
Taylor said his squad would re
sume practice Dec. 16 and that he
hoped to get in 15 days of work.
The Big Ten-PCC agreement allows
16 days. He said the club would
leave for Los Angeles the day after
Christmas —but he doesn't know yet
where to stay.
