# Two Vets on Hand as Boxing Squad Trains
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Only two veterans remain from last season on Coach Ray Lun
ny's Stanford boxing team which is currently preparing for its
opening match with California early in January.
Lunny, back as Stanford's ring coach after serving last year on
active duty in the Navy, has had to "start virtually from scratch,"

as he puts it, in developing his 1952
squad.
Bob White at 135 pounds and Bob
Baldocchi at 165 are veterans of last
year's mediocre squad. Both of
these fighters were top performers,
however, and promise well for this
season under Lunny's tutelage.
White, fighting out of a catlike
crouch, is known for his speed and
boxing ability; while Baldocchi,
Inn:* and lean for his weight, tangles
in some round slugging battles,
punching in a whiplike manner
with both of his long arms.

Should Have Depth
The top Indian newcomers also
fall into the foregoing weight cato- I
gories, giving Stanford good depth ,
in certain spots.
Tony Wynn, a sophomore with one ]
of the hardest punches Lunny has |
seen on campus in some time, is |
training with and battling Baldocchi
for the 165-pound spot.
Bob Pallies, who with Wynn has
graduated from elementary boxing ]
to the varsity squad just this fall,
promises to back up White in the
135-pound slot.
Other top prospects, all of whom
have been training since the begin
ning of school in September, in
clude the following by weights:
At 125 pounds is Romeo Formen
tini, a short chunky lad, who has
been displaying a lot of willingness
to mix it up.
Ed Scarborough, a junior with a
well-developed left jab, and Bob
Nunes are contending for the num
ber one position at 145 pounds.
At 155, Lunny has high hopes for
a lad by the name of Bill Milling
ton, an ex-Marine who gained his
previous experience fighting in the
Corps.
Football Hits Heavyweights
The 175-pound or light - heavy
weight situation is at present cloud
ed by the football commitments of
two potential candidates. Bob Mey
| ers, starting halfback on the Card
varsity, held down this position last
j year, but he is slated to pass up
1 boxing in favor of continuing with
the gridiron sport through the Rose
Bowl.
Lunny does not know for certain
either whether or not Jack Biekel,
who plays QB on the Rose Bowlers,
I will turn out for boxing, but states

that in the event he does, he will be
a good prospect for the light-heavy
spot.
The heavyweight position finds
Bill McMahon, to whom the nick
name "Big" applies equally well
with respect to size and punch, well
! in command.
"Should Re Exciting"
Summing up, Lunny reports that
j his squad, while inexperienced in
general, is willing and "should he
; able to put on some pretty exciting
j shows."
He adds that any man who has
I sufficient boxing experience to he
! a potential varsity candidate may
1 still come out for the team by sign
j ing up to take the sport as a class
j in winter quarter.

Bill McMahon, to whom the nick
name "Big" applies equally well
with respect to size and punch, well

"Should Re Exciting"
Summing up, Lunny reports that
j his squad, while inexperienced in
general, is willing and "should he
; able to put on some pretty exciting
j shows."
He adds that any man who has
I sufficient boxing experience to he
! a potential varsity candidate may
1 still come out for the team by sign
j ing up to take the sport as a class
j in winter quarter.
Only two veterans remain from last season on Coach Ray Lun
ny's Stanford boxing team which is currently preparing for its
opening match with California early in January.
Lunny, back as Stanford's ring coach after serving last year on
active duty in the Navy, has had to "start virtually from scratch,"

as he puts it, in developing his 1952
squad.
Bob White at 135 pounds and Bob
Baldocchi at 165 are veterans of last
year's mediocre squad. Both of
these fighters were top performers,
however, and promise well for this
season under Lunny's tutelage.
White, fighting out of a catlike
crouch, is known for his speed and
boxing ability; while Baldocchi,
Inn:* and lean for his weight, tangles
in some round slugging battles,
punching in a whiplike manner
with both of his long arms.

Should Have Depth
The top Indian newcomers also
fall into the foregoing weight cato- I
gories, giving Stanford good depth ,
in certain spots.
Tony Wynn, a sophomore with one ]
of the hardest punches Lunny has |
seen on campus in some time, is |
training with and battling Baldocchi
for the 165-pound spot.
Bob Pallies, who with Wynn has
graduated from elementary boxing ]
to the varsity squad just this fall,
promises to back up White in the
135-pound slot.
Other top prospects, all of whom
have been training since the begin
ning of school in September, in
clude the following by weights:
At 125 pounds is Romeo Formen
tini, a short chunky lad, who has
been displaying a lot of willingness
to mix it up.
Ed Scarborough, a junior with a
well-developed left jab, and Bob
Nunes are contending for the num
ber one position at 145 pounds.
At 155, Lunny has high hopes for
a lad by the name of Bill Milling
ton, an ex-Marine who gained his
previous experience fighting in the
Corps.
Football Hits Heavyweights
The 175-pound or light - heavy
weight situation is at present cloud
ed by the football commitments of
two potential candidates. Bob Mey
| ers, starting halfback on the Card
varsity, held down this position last
j year, but he is slated to pass up
1 boxing in favor of continuing with
the gridiron sport through the Rose
Bowl.
Lunny does not know for certain
either whether or not Jack Biekel,
who plays QB on the Rose Bowlers,
I will turn out for boxing, but states

that in the event he does, he will be
a good prospect for the light-heavy
spot.
