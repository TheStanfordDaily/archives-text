# Sadie Bares Her Identity
## 
### HERB SEITER 
Stanford Sadie, the soft-voiced
female who has been luring
Stanford roughs from their
books every Monday night over
KZSU, revealed herself as He
lene Buchtel, a Roble frosh, in
her final broadcast of the quar
; ter last night.
Helene, whose last name is pro- |
! nounced "book tell," is a speech and i
! drama major from Evanston, 111., I
I with blue eyes and brunette hair.
' Members of the KZSU staff have
agreed that she is as attractive to
see as her voice is to hear over the
radio.
When Helene was given the role
{ of Sadie, after being auditioned with
a large number of other girls at the
! first of the quarter, she thought it
was too good to be true. When a i
! KZSU staff member called her up
' to tell her she had been chosen,
i Helene thought he was some prac
| tical joker. The KZSU-er had to
talk fast and furiously for five min- ]
I utes before she was convinced she !
had really won the part of Sadie.
'Most Wonderful'
Helene says, "It was the most
wonderful thing that happened to
me during my first quarter at Stan
ford." When asked how it felt to I
play the role of Sadie, she said that
it was somewhat difficult to main
tain the split personality. "It is
very hard to be Stanford Sadie on
Monday night, and then snap back
to being an ordinary freshman girl,"
she said.
When asked if there were any
disappointments during her quarter
of playing Sadie, Helene said that
she had always understood that
frosh men usually raided the stu
dio sometime during the quarter to
discover who Sadie was. There was
no raid this quarter. "Freshmen
just aren't what they used to be,"
she assumed.
Behind the Scene
The man behind the Sadie scene
this quarter has been Dunny Clark
who wrote the scripts that Sadie
delivered to her public. Clark is
also managing editor of the Chap
pie.
Roger Walters, program director,
said last quarter's decision was dif
ficult, and that there were a large
number of girls who tried out who
could have taken the part. He
hopes that all those who tried out
last fall will come back again this
winter.
