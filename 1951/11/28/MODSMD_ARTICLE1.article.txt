WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (UP)—
The Army announced today that
none of the 90 West Point Cadets
dismissed lor cribbing in examina
tions last August will be considered
for reappointment to the Military
Academy.
The announcement came after
three Congressmen who had re
nominated dismissed cadets were
notified the appointees would not be
considered for reappointment under
the circumstances.
Under the law, all the dismussed
cadets technically were eligible for
renomination provided they were
accepted by the Point's academic
board.
An Army spokesman said, how
ever, that "the Academic Board has
never accepted a cadet for reap
pointment who was dismissed for
violating the honor code." He said
the board is standing by that tradi
tion.
