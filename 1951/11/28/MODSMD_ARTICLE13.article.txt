# Troops Cease Fire as Planes, Artillery Battle; Talks Stalled
## Uneasy Calm Grips Korea 
### 
TOKYO, Wednesday, Nov. 28
(UP) —United Nations and Com
munist troops, nervously finger
ing the triggers of their guns,
faced each other uneasily today
across the day-old Korean cease
fire line.
Overhead the shriek of jet en
gines and the vapor trails of fight
ers and bombers emphasized that
there was no peace in this uncer
tain and unfamiliar calm. The rum
ble of big guns behind both lines
destroyed the illusion of quiet. And
battle-wise troops were alert to the
fact that there were no guarantees,
no agreement that the bloody, full
scale ground action might not re
sume at. any moment.
American and Allied pilots did
not share even the front-line illu
sion of fretful quiet.
They hunted Russian-built MIGs
and blasted enemy supply lines and
build-up areas, after a furious day
of encounters Tuesday in which
they shot down four Communist
jets, damaged four, and lost one
American F-80 Shooting Star in six
engagements.
The ground forces on both sides
drew up short and paused along the
newly agreed demarcation line soon
after it was announced Tuesday af
ternoon.
Allied troops astride the bitterly
contested "Little Gibraltar" com
plex of strategic hills west of Yon
chon reported the Red Chinese at
tacks were halted. Only artillery
exchanges shook the area where
until yesterday Communist forces
staged one screaming attack after
another.
UN patrols in the area poked cau
tiously across the demarcation line
and reported "no contact."
Even artillery fire lacked the
punch of pre-agreement days.
While there was no agreement to
stop the fighting, there was little
reason for either side to start an
offensive if the signatjres affixed tu
the Panmunjom agreement were
sincere. That agreement will make
the present battle line the final de
marcation line, if a full armistice is
reached before the 30 days' "trial
period" ends.
But no such considerations re
strained the Air Force or naval
units.


PLOT CEASE-FIRE LINE — Allied and Communist officers in
Panmunjon, Korea, work over a single map, determining the
line of battle contact which yesterday became the provisional
demarcation line. Marine Corps Col. James Murray (right) pen
cils the map as Chinese Lt. Col. Tsai Cheng Wan does the same.
