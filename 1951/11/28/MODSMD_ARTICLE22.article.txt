TOKYO, Wednesday, Nov. 28
(UP) — Allied truce negotiators
met the Communists in Panmun
jom today faced with Red resis
tance to any United Nations ef
fort to send truce inspectors be
hind North Korea's iron curtain.
Gen. Nam 11, the chief Communist
armistice delegate, was on record as
opposing the UN demand for truce
inspections throughout Korea to
the Manchurian border it necessary
—even before today's plenary ses
sion began in the Panmunjom truce
tent.
Vice-Adm. C'. Turner Joy as:kpd
the right to send inspectors "any
where in Korea" — to the China
boundary if necessary—to see that
the truce is carried out and that
neither side secretly builds up a
military force for a sudden on
slaught.
The Communists' rival plan for
umpiring the peace made no men
tion of such inspection teams. It
pointedly avoided any suggestion
that both sides freeze their military
strength as proposed by the UN,
and that too may become a major
item of dispute in further talks.
Should the Communists agree to
UN inspection it would be the first
time the free world ever had a peek
at Communist military maneuver
ings behind the Iron Curtain.
And there was every indication
the Reds would oppose the plan to
the bitter end. Nam II indicated
that line when he said he could not
even agree in principle.
Today's meeting of the full ar
mistice teams began at 11 a.m. (t>
p.m. PST Tuesday). It was a nego
tiators' race against the calendar to
settle remaining truce points before
time runs out on the provisional
cease-fire line which remains in ef
fect for only 30 days.
A few hours after the tentative
cease-fire line was ratified yester
day, the delegations were in con
flict on the next item on the pro
gram—ways and means to bring the
armistice into effect.
The Allies want joint Allied-
Communist observer teams to have
free access to all Korea from Pu
san to the Yalu River. The Reds
want to put off discussion of that
particular problem until the ar
mistice is signed. They insisted a
higher level should decide it later.

and that too may become a major
item of dispute in further talks.
Should the Communists agree to
UN inspection it would be the first
time the free world ever had a peek
at Communist military maneuver
ings behind the Iron Curtain.
And there was every indication
the Reds would oppose the plan to
the bitter end. Nam II indicated
that line when he said he could not
even agree in principle.
Today's meeting of the full ar
mistice teams began at 11 a.m. (t>
p.m. PST Tuesday). It was a nego
tiators' race against the calendar to
settle remaining truce points before
time runs out on the provisional
cease-fire line which remains in ef
fect for only 30 days.
A few hours after the tentative
cease-fire line was ratified yester
day, the delegations were in con
flict on the next item on the pro
gram—ways and means to bring the
armistice into effect.
The Allies want joint Allied-
Communist observer teams to have
free access to all Korea from Pu
san to the Yalu River. The Reds
want to put off discussion of that
particular problem until the ar
mistice is signed. They insisted a
higher level should decide it later.
