# Student-Faculty Co-operation

### 
When debate over the lower division lan
guage requirement broke out recently, there
was much talk at first. Many letters were writ
ten, a few good suggestions were noted. The
issue was brought into the open.
But the initial interest quickly slackened.
Soon it began to look like the natural cycle of
a crusade: first the presentation of the issue,
followed by much interest and loud talk. Then a
lessening of interest, and finally the issue for
gotten and no action taken.
But such was not the case. Thanks to the
Student-Faculty Education Commission, the
foreign language debate did not simply die.
This group knows how to save crusades.
Right now the commission, composed of five
faculty members and five students, is meeting
with officials of the Germanic and Romanic Lan
guages department to discuss possible changes.
They have been informed by the department
that work is going forward on a revision of the
language program, as well as the entire lower
division required subject schedule. A poll is
being considered. Further talks have been
scheduled.
And this is nothing new for the Student-
Faculty Education Commission. The lan
guage debate isn't the tirst hot potato the
group has handled since its start in 1950.
Last year, for example, the group referred the
long standing problem of the lower division
adviser system to Registrar Harvey Hall. Hall
is right now attempting to smooth out sore spots
in the adviser program by educating the ad
visers more thoroughly on their important re
sponsibilities.
Another project the group is working on now
concerns better opportunities for independent
study by advanced students. Also, evaluation
of lower division survey courses such as Psych
51 and Sociology 1 may soon be attempted.
The commission doesn't try to be the group

to make far reaching decisions. But they do
try to refer ideas to those who can take action.
Sometimes this turns out to be a slow process,
but this doesn't mean the commission is stall
ing. It's simply a matter of waiting for aca
demic change, a slow process at best.
As we see it, the most importaijt single factor
that both faculty members and student mem
bers of the commission must possess is trust
of each other. Both groups must be willing to
accept the other's ideas and actions as sincere
attempts to help Stanford education.
It doesn't take a genius to realize there are a
few faculty people who regard students as
mere tools to be taught. Likewise, it doesn't
take d genius to realize some students treat
college as a summer resort.
It does take a mature student and a mature
teacher to realize that both faculty and stu
dent body can help each other if they only
will. The Student-Faculty Education Commis
sion is a common meeting place where both
groups can meet and discuss mutual prob
lems. A great deal of progress toward better
understanding — and a better university —
should result from a good commission.
Our definition of a good commission is, once
again, a group where all members trust each
other's opinions and thus can feel free to criti
cize and praise and get directly to the root of
problems.
And speaking of good commissions, and ma
ture members, three student positions are open
at this time. Interviews will be held tomorrow
and Friday (see Once Around The Quad). If
interviewers do their part to get competent stu
dents on the board, and if President Sterling
continues to appoint faculty members with a
sincere interest in the student body, then noth
ing but a good commission can result. The
work a good commission can do is unlimited.
