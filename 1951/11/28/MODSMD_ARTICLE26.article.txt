# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE . . .
For (lie benefit of all the people who have asked me,
no, I did not flush the toilets in the Space Patrol skit
in the Gaieties. I did play a larger though un-monu
mental part in the show. But In all modesty, I do not
consider myself a serious threat for the academy
awards.

My purpose for turning out for
the Gaieties was a journalistic
rather than a theatrical one. I
wanted to see the "inside" of col
lege show business, so to speak.
Hal Burdick did a tremendous job
in directing the extravaganza and
sterling performances were turned
in by Fred Forsman, George
Denny, Melba Wiser, Sue Alter,
Helen Gaylord, Ned Hutchinson,
Jock deCasasus, Ann Lawder,

Morgan Stock, and others. They all went 60 minutes
of offense and defense, all of them.
That doesn't mean that all four nights went smoothly.
They didn't. Stub holders who sat in on Thursday's
Gaieties probably noticed more than a few mishaps,
most of which added rather than detracted from the
show.
The most cataclysmic mishap occurrcd Thursday
in the finale. Here's the situation: The rooting sec
tion is sitting in the bleachers, nervously spraying
chewed fingernails all over the place. It's the last
play of the game, and Stanford (represented liy a
skeleton team of three players) has to score on this
play to win the game, Kcrkorian, played by Fred
Joslyn, had completed 13 passes in 13 rehearsals of
the skit. McColl, played by Lloyd Laribcc, had
caught 13 passes in 13 rehearsals of the skit.
And so here it is .. . third down, just a few seconds
remaining, and Cal ahead by six points. Josyln fades
back, spots Laribcc at the other end of the stage, and
cocks his whip-like arm. He throws, the ball whirls

through the air, and Laribcc stands all by himself
waiting for it. The ball approaches Laribce's out
stretched hands, and then he freezes, and the ball
drope to the turf (floor) with a sickening thud.
Gad, here is real, stark drama . . . unrehearsed
drama, that is.
The rooting section, ably portrayed by the chorus,
takes it for granted that McColl (Laribcc) will catch
the projectile and they arc clued to jump up, charge
onto the field, and sing "Golden Victory." This would
be the supreme test of the chorus members as actors.
Could they ad lib it and let Kcrkorian (Josyln) throw
another pass in the final second of play?
No, they flubbed it. They watched the ball drop to the
ground, hoped that too many of the audience didn't
see it, wiped a sickly smile off their collective face and
broke into joyous song. In the meantime, the dropped
ball lay on the floor—a grim reminder that the chorus
forgot to ad lib.
I know of at least two people in the audience that
saw the dropped pass. Their names were Kcrkorian
and McColl.

BRANNER KISSING DEPT. — Jean McClure, a
frosh penwoman from Branncr, comes up with an
interesting item. She reports that it is a custom for
Branncr girls who have birthdays to be kissed by the
Branncr male hashers. It is equally true that if a
man has his birthday at Branncr, he is kissed by the
coed hashers.
As President Sterling put in the guest book, "Oh, to
have my birthdays at Branncr."
* * *
RETIRE NUMBER THREE. I want to go on record
right now as saying that Bill McColl's number 3
jersey should be retired. How often is it that we
have an All-Amcrican two years running? McColl
is probably the greatest lineman in Stanford's history
and it just wouldn't seem right for anyone else to
wear number 3.) Earl Odell (see sports) has the
same idea. How about it, athletic department?

no, I did not flush the toilets in the Space Patrol skit
in the Gaieties. I did play a larger though un-monu
mental part in the show. But In all modesty, I do not
consider myself a serious threat for the academy
awards.

My purpose for turning out for
the Gaieties was a journalistic
rather than a theatrical one. I
wanted to see the "inside" of col
lege show business, so to speak.
Hal Burdick did a tremendous job
in directing the extravaganza and
sterling performances were turned
in by Fred Forsman, George
Denny, Melba Wiser, Sue Alter,
Helen Gaylord, Ned Hutchinson,
Jock deCasasus, Ann Lawder,

Morgan Stock, and others. They all went 60 minutes
of offense and defense, all of them.
That doesn't mean that all four nights went smoothly.
They didn't. Stub holders who sat in on Thursday's
Gaieties probably noticed more than a few mishaps,
most of which added rather than detracted from the
show.
The most cataclysmic mishap occurrcd Thursday
in the finale. Here's the situation: The rooting sec
tion is sitting in the bleachers, nervously spraying
chewed fingernails all over the place. It's the last
play of the game, and Stanford (represented liy a
skeleton team of three players) has to score on this
play to win the game, Kcrkorian, played by Fred
Joslyn, had completed 13 passes in 13 rehearsals of
the skit. McColl, played by Lloyd Laribcc, had
caught 13 passes in 13 rehearsals of the skit.
And so here it is .. . third down, just a few seconds
remaining, and Cal ahead by six points. Josyln fades
back, spots Laribcc at the other end of the stage, and
cocks his whip-like arm. He throws, the ball whirls

through the air, and Laribcc stands all by himself
waiting for it. The ball approaches Laribce's out
stretched hands, and then he freezes, and the ball
drope to the turf (floor) with a sickening thud.
Gad, here is real, stark drama . . . unrehearsed
drama, that is.
The rooting section, ably portrayed by the chorus,
takes it for granted that McColl (Laribcc) will catch
the projectile and they arc clued to jump up, charge
onto the field, and sing "Golden Victory." This would
be the supreme test of the chorus members as actors.
Could they ad lib it and let Kcrkorian (Josyln) throw
another pass in the final second of play?
No, they flubbed it. They watched the ball drop to the
ground, hoped that too many of the audience didn't
see it, wiped a sickly smile off their collective face and
broke into joyous song. In the meantime, the dropped
ball lay on the floor—a grim reminder that the chorus
forgot to ad lib.
I know of at least two people in the audience that
saw the dropped pass. Their names were Kcrkorian
and McColl.

interesting item. She reports that it is a custom for
Branncr girls who have birthdays to be kissed by the
Branncr male hashers. It is equally true that if a
man has his birthday at Branncr, he is kissed by the
coed hashers.

RETIRE NUMBER THREE. I want to go on record
right now as saying that Bill McColl's number 3
jersey should be retired. How often is it that we
have an All-Amcrican two years running? McColl
is probably the greatest lineman in Stanford's history
and it just wouldn't seem right for anyone else to
wear number 3.) Earl Odell (see sports) has the
same idea. How about it, athletic department?
