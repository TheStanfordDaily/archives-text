# CAMPUS OPINION
## Thanks for Intramural Players 
### 
To the Fditor:
Speaking for all the intramural referees and officials,
we'd like to take this opportunity to thank all com
petitors in Stanford intramural play for the sports
manship and cooperation which they have shown this
quarter.
There have been many occasions when the Stanford
Honor Code has been carried from the classroom out
to the playing fields. This indirectly speaks for the
success of the Code which is supposed to be followed by
Stanforditcs wherever they go. Many times intramural
football players have been honest enough to admit that
they never "tagged" their man even though the single
referee had thought they had. With only one official to
a game it's rather difficult to call them all correctly,
but our job was made much easier this year because
of the honesty of the players; and many times this
honesty cost them a scorc or a large gain, perhaps even
a hard-fought game.
We'd also like to thank the intramural managers
for getting most of the games played with a minimum
of forfeits. If Winter and Spring Quarter intramurals
arc handled as well, wc should have the best intra
mural year ever.

I wish to express my thanks to the living groups
for coming through in such great shape on their
house decorations even though rain almost forced the
cancellation of same. Such evident and thorough co
operation made the chairman's job a real pleasure.
The judges trudged the length of the Row and ac
tually made the full tour of the campus house decora
tions twice before they would commit themselves on
a choice of winners. The judges were Dr. Rcgncry of
the Biology Department, Mr. O'Callaghan and Mr.
Allyn of the Western Civ Department, and Betty
Hclmholtz from the Encina Officc together with Mrs.
Henderson, Director of Toyon Hall. They did a swell
job.
My thanks also to Kathy Snyder, Julie Rufener, and
Diane Goldman who were invaluable with their as
sistance.
