WASHINGTON â€” Present taxes
will fall about $20,000,000,000 short
of keeping the defense program on
a "pay-as-we-go" basis during the
next two fiscal years, budget ex
perts said today.
President Truman is expected to
ask Congress in January to raise
taxes sharply, but Congressional
leaders have indicated they will
turn a deaf ear to any plea for a
new tax increase in an election
year.
