# Senior Tells of Job In Alaska Gold Mine
## 
### SUE WHEAT 
Students have a lot of fun in the summer time: some grind away
at typewriters, others 101 l on sunny beaches, and a few are escorted
through the cathedrals of Europe. But Ray Connell, 21-year-old
pre-dental student who has entered Stanford as a senior and Village
resident this year, has a solution for summer that includes all as-

pects of fun. He mines gold in
AJaska.
Ray's first summer there was
strictly a lark. For no particular
reason, he explains, he had "a sud
den urge to go to Alaska."
Leaving his home town of Down
ey (near Los Angeles), Ray hopped
a bus to Seattle. From there, a non
scheduled flight took him to Fair
banks.
In Fairbanks were lots of
college students . . . and no em
ployment. Connell heard of a rail
road crew working in the area,
however, and after a fiO-mile ex
cursion over Alaskan country
side, he caught up with a railroad
gang. By luck, some Eskimos had
quit the day before and Ray got
a job—driving spikes for $615 a
month!
At the end of that first summer,
a man named Alfred Bernard in
terested Connell in working a new
gold mine near Nome the following
summer.
In June of this year, Ray received
from Bernard a round-trip plane
ticket to Nome. "You can imagine
how anxious I was for school to
end," he says.
Near Nome, Connell joined the
mining outfit. The gold was being
mined by a placer process from a
stream called Bear Creek. The area
had previously been prospected
with pan and pick by miners look
ing for "pay dirt."
Ray's job was to stay on the
business end of a shovel and keep
the gravel moving through the
boxes. About every two weeks
there was a "big time." For then
the riffles were removed from the
boxes and the gold taken out.
A handful of yellowish alluvium
may be the entire result of two
weeks of labor, but this "handful"
is usually worth thousands of dol
lars.
One September morning Ray
and a companion walked out of
camp to go and see another mine.
For hours they followed the
marked trails, but, reaching the
end of one of those, "We began
going up and down ridges," as
Council puts it.
By late afternoon, all signs of life
(except for bear tracks) had van
ished, and they admitted to them
selves that they were lost. Just be
fore dark, however, they shot two
ptarmigans (a type of grouse).
Building a fire, they roasted and
ate one of them.
That night, huddled in the sub
freezing cold (25' F.), they sat up
to keep the fire going and watched
the Northern Lights.
The next morning Ray and his
friend saw a distant wisp of smoke.
They started out toward it, eating
berries along the way. Stopping to
rest, they built a fire and ate their
second—and last—ptarmigan. Hours
of tramping and stumbling finally
bdought them to the smoke—and to
a small empty cabin. Entering they
found a bowl of soup which they
promptly consumed.
Soon the cabin's tenant re
turned. lie was an old miner and
was able to direct them to another
mine. Ray figures that those two
days involved about 35 miles of
walking.
By a series of air hops, Ray made
his way out of Alaska And home
ward. At Los Angeles he threw his
clothcs into a suitcase and got up
to Stanford just in time to register.

a small empty cabin. Entering they
found a bowl of soup which they
promptly consumed.
Soon the cabin's tenant re
turned. lie was an old miner and
was able to direct them to another
mine. Ray figures that those two
days involved about 35 miles of
walking.
By a series of air hops, Ray made
his way out of Alaska And home
ward. At Los Angeles he threw his
clothcs into a suitcase and got up
to Stanford just in time to register.
Students have a lot of fun in the summer time: some grind away
at typewriters, others 101 l on sunny beaches, and a few are escorted
through the cathedrals of Europe. But Ray Connell, 21-year-old
pre-dental student who has entered Stanford as a senior and Village
resident this year, has a solution for summer that includes all as-

pects of fun. He mines gold in
AJaska.
Ray's first summer there was
strictly a lark. For no particular
reason, he explains, he had "a sud
den urge to go to Alaska."
Leaving his home town of Down
ey (near Los Angeles), Ray hopped
a bus to Seattle. From there, a non
scheduled flight took him to Fair
banks.
In Fairbanks were lots of
college students . . . and no em
ployment. Connell heard of a rail
road crew working in the area,
however, and after a fiO-mile ex
cursion over Alaskan country
side, he caught up with a railroad
gang. By luck, some Eskimos had
quit the day before and Ray got
a job—driving spikes for $615 a
month!
At the end of that first summer,
a man named Alfred Bernard in
terested Connell in working a new
gold mine near Nome the following
summer.
In June of this year, Ray received
from Bernard a round-trip plane
ticket to Nome. "You can imagine
how anxious I was for school to
end," he says.
Near Nome, Connell joined the
mining outfit. The gold was being
mined by a placer process from a
stream called Bear Creek. The area
had previously been prospected
with pan and pick by miners look
ing for "pay dirt."
Ray's job was to stay on the
business end of a shovel and keep
the gravel moving through the
boxes. About every two weeks
there was a "big time." For then
the riffles were removed from the
boxes and the gold taken out.
A handful of yellowish alluvium
may be the entire result of two
weeks of labor, but this "handful"
is usually worth thousands of dol
lars.
One September morning Ray
and a companion walked out of
camp to go and see another mine.
For hours they followed the
marked trails, but, reaching the
end of one of those, "We began
going up and down ridges," as
Council puts it.
By late afternoon, all signs of life
(except for bear tracks) had van
ished, and they admitted to them
selves that they were lost. Just be
fore dark, however, they shot two
ptarmigans (a type of grouse).
Building a fire, they roasted and
ate one of them.
That night, huddled in the sub
freezing cold (25' F.), they sat up
to keep the fire going and watched
the Northern Lights.
The next morning Ray and his
friend saw a distant wisp of smoke.
They started out toward it, eating
berries along the way. Stopping to
rest, they built a fire and ate their
second—and last—ptarmigan. Hours
of tramping and stumbling finally
bdought them to the smoke—and to
a small empty cabin. Entering they
found a bowl of soup which they
promptly consumed.
