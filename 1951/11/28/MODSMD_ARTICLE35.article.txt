### BY "DIGGER" ODELL 
The usual procedure for a Wednesday morning column during football
season is to review the previous week's game and preview the next.
Since there is no game next weekend, and since the coming Rose Bowl
game has been adequately covered by Pete Grothe in his column yesterday,
there's nothing much to do in that department. And since the Big Game has
been replayed a dozen or more times in the papers, we won't'dwell on that
subject any more than to repeat a statement we made in The Daily Monday—
the last paragraph of the game story, to be exact.
Th'.> Stanford Indians can live down the defeat by Cal by joiner down to
Pasadena next January and beating hell out of Illinois. That's not going to
be an easy job by any means, but if we do, it will mark the first PCC win
in four years and once again Stanford will be the toast wf the coast.

IT AIN'T GOOD TO RILE BEARS—A couple of Cal students we talked
to after the game Saturday said the last straw in* this underdog business
came last Wednesday when the Stanford cheerleaders called the California
cheerleaders and asked them where they could meet after the game to
exchange the Axe. These Cal students said the whole California campus—
including the football team—was so mad, they were more determined than
ever to win.
* * *
THOSE UNIFORMS HAVE GOTTA GO—A prominent alumni took
his seven-year-old daughter to the Oregon State game and after the game,
wanting to make an impression on her, he took her over to meet Kerkorian,
McColl, and a few others. She was very polite and seemed quite awed by
them, but on the way home she turned to her father and said, "But daddy,
don't you know any bandplayers?"

TWO CRUSADES DEPARTMENT—(I) We'd like to go on record as
putting in our bid for Chuck Taylor as Coach of The Year. No other coach
this year has done as good a job in turning out a team both physically and
mentally tops. Taylor took a team which last year showed only a few sparks
of greatness and ignited them into the flame of the Coast.
It took a psychological twist and a strengthening of fundamental to make
the 1951 Indians champions, and Chuck Taylor and his staff did just that.
If there was a Coaching Staff of The Year honor, we believe the Stanford
coaching staff would be a shoo-in.
(2) This is something that hasn't been brought up before, but we're of
the opinion that Bill McColl's number three iersey should be retired. An
All-Amcrican for two years running. Bill has put the Stanford Indians in
the national limelight this year and last year.
Only one other Stanford jersey has ever been retired and that was the
great fullback Ernie Nevers' number one in the mid-twenties. Nevers' would
never fit anyone else, and we believe quite equally no one could ever do
justice to number three.

Take your heart out of the Stanford Stadium and gently place it in the
Pavilion while we adjust our typewriter for the coming basketball season.
You see, typewriters must go a little faster for the indoor casaha game, and
for the Indian varsity quintet they'll have to be lined with asbestos, for
you'll see a lot of fast action this coming year on the Stanford court.
With Bob Burnett taking over the reigns of the Cards after Everett Dean
retired from basketball coaching at the end of his thirtieth year last season,
the 1951-52 Indian cage squad is set for perhaps its best season since 1941
when Stanford won the PCC.
Basketball season will be like football season in two respects: The Con
ference will be tight this year with the two top teams, UCLA and USC
slightly weaker than last season and Stanford and Cal slightly stronger.
Also like the grid season, Stanford will present an All-American can
didate, this time in the person in one Edward Tucker, who plays forward.
Ed, who transferred from Compton JC and in his first season in the PCC,
was the second highest scorer and received honorable mention for Ail-
American. This year, according to Burnett, he's even better, showing
speed, aggressiveness and a great eye.
Ail in all, this basketball season will be a great one from the spectator's
viewpoint, as you'll see plenty of action and some great performances by
Tucker, Jim Ramstcad, Jim Walsh, Bill Stevenson, and Paul Johnson.

All-Amcrican for two years running. Bill has put the Stanford Indians in
the national limelight this year and last year.
Only one other Stanford jersey has ever been retired and that was the
great fullback Ernie Nevers' number one in the mid-twenties. Nevers' would
never fit anyone else, and we believe quite equally no one could ever do
justice to number three.

Take your heart out of the Stanford Stadium and gently place it in the
Pavilion while we adjust our typewriter for the coming basketball season.
You see, typewriters must go a little faster for the indoor casaha game, and
for the Indian varsity quintet they'll have to be lined with asbestos, for
you'll see a lot of fast action this coming year on the Stanford court.
With Bob Burnett taking over the reigns of the Cards after Everett Dean
retired from basketball coaching at the end of his thirtieth year last season,
the 1951-52 Indian cage squad is set for perhaps its best season since 1941
when Stanford won the PCC.
Basketball season will be like football season in two respects: The Con
ference will be tight this year with the two top teams, UCLA and USC
slightly weaker than last season and Stanford and Cal slightly stronger.
Also like the grid season, Stanford will present an All-American can
didate, this time in the person in one Edward Tucker, who plays forward.
Ed, who transferred from Compton JC and in his first season in the PCC,
was the second highest scorer and received honorable mention for Ail-
American. This year, according to Burnett, he's even better, showing
speed, aggressiveness and a great eye.
Ail in all, this basketball season will be a great one from the spectator's
viewpoint, as you'll see plenty of action and some great performances by
Tucker, Jim Ramstcad, Jim Walsh, Bill Stevenson, and Paul Johnson.
The usual procedure for a Wednesday morning column during football
season is to review the previous week's game and preview the next.
Since there is no game next weekend, and since the coming Rose Bowl
game has been adequately covered by Pete Grothe in his column yesterday,
there's nothing much to do in that department. And since the Big Game has
been replayed a dozen or more times in the papers, we won't'dwell on that
subject any more than to repeat a statement we made in The Daily Monday—
the last paragraph of the game story, to be exact.
Th'.> Stanford Indians can live down the defeat by Cal by joiner down to
Pasadena next January and beating hell out of Illinois. That's not going to
be an easy job by any means, but if we do, it will mark the first PCC win
in four years and once again Stanford will be the toast wf the coast.

IT AIN'T GOOD TO RILE BEARS—A couple of Cal students we talked
to after the game Saturday said the last straw in* this underdog business
came last Wednesday when the Stanford cheerleaders called the California
cheerleaders and asked them where they could meet after the game to
exchange the Axe. These Cal students said the whole California campus—
including the football team—was so mad, they were more determined than
ever to win.

THOSE UNIFORMS HAVE GOTTA GO—A prominent alumni took
his seven-year-old daughter to the Oregon State game and after the game,
wanting to make an impression on her, he took her over to meet Kerkorian,
McColl, and a few others. She was very polite and seemed quite awed by
them, but on the way home she turned to her father and said, "But daddy,
don't you know any bandplayers?"

TWO CRUSADES DEPARTMENT—(I) We'd like to go on record as
putting in our bid for Chuck Taylor as Coach of The Year. No other coach
this year has done as good a job in turning out a team both physically and
mentally tops. Taylor took a team which last year showed only a few sparks
of greatness and ignited them into the flame of the Coast.
It took a psychological twist and a strengthening of fundamental to make
the 1951 Indians champions, and Chuck Taylor and his staff did just that.
If there was a Coaching Staff of The Year honor, we believe the Stanford
coaching staff would be a shoo-in.
