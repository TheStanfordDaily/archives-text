# Bright Outlook Faces Burnett's Speedy Squad
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
It's bouncetime again.
Believe it or not, but the basketballs are bouncing heavy and
fast in Stanford's Pavilion. The Varsity cagers collide with Cali
fornia Poly in the season opener this Friday. And it's only a couple
of days away.
The Stanford brand of basketball will be wearing a new label

this year. Everything seems to be
new. Bob Burnett has taken over the
head coaching role, as Ev Dean has
retired from his hardwood duties and
will devote full time to baseball.
Burnett has been frosh coach and
Dean's assistant for several seasons
and is quite familiar with the player
material available. In his playing
days before the war. Bob earned
letters in both baseball and basket
ball. Only in his early M's, Bob
follows the Chuck Taylor youth
formula in the athletic department.
Gus Chavalas and Jack O'Sullivan
are the chief assistants. Gus, a for
mer co-captain and guard on the
Yardley team, gained some experi
ence as jayvee mentor last year and
will handle the same job. O'Sullivan
captained last year's Indian crew and
is doing grad work in education.
Lots of Hustle
Speed and more speed is the key
to this year's play. An all-out fast
break is the offensive pattern. With

and is hustling more than ever. He
edged out strong-boy Don Carlson,
powerful soph, who has been fighting
the cold bug.
Tomsic fits in at the other forward
position in the second unit. He shows
a lot for a first-year man and should
be pushing hard for a berth on the
first-string. Dave Epperson, rangy
sharpshooter, will provide the Ram
mer with ample rest at the pivot.
Fritz Fenster rounds out the second
team, which has plenty of speed and
scoring punch.
The remainder of the Varsity
roster consists of Gary Andrews, Don
DeLong, Tom DuFour, Tom Green,
Bruce Iverson, and George Zanino
vich. All are vets except for DeLong
and Green who are up from the frosh.
The squad along with the jayvees
turned out for pre-season condition
ing the first two weeks of October.
Then, according to PCC rules, official
practice opened in the middle of the
month. The conditioning consisted of
running up and down the Stadium
stairs. The practice sessions have
been held every afternoon from 4 to 6.
About two full scale scrimmages are
held each week with refs and all.
According to Coach Burnett,
"The division race should be as
close as the National League pen
nant chase. UCLA should be a
little weaker. SC will be weaker.
Cal will be much stronger. And
we should be a little tougher. It
should be as close as can be."

more reserve strength than since be
fore the war, the squad should be
able to keep the run game up all
night. A pressing man-to-man de
fense has been rigged up by Coach
Burnett and his assistants.
The team is loaded with experience,
as O'Sullivan is the only one missing
from last year's starting five. Ten
returnees are lead by Ed Tuckcr,
high - scoring All - division forward;
Jim Ramstead, steady All-Coast cen
ter; and Jim Walsh, fiery guard out
for his third year of first string duty.
The team is l-einforced by five
players up from last year's "greatest
evei'" frosh Papooses and a sensa
tional freshman prospect, Ron Tom
sic from Fremont high school in Oak
land.
The Top Flight
Along with the Big Three of Tuc
ker, Ramstead, and Walsh, the first
string is composed of Paul Johnson
at a guard post and Forward Bill
Stevenson. Johnson has been hooked
up in a tough fight for starting honors
with soph 01 lie Suzdaleff, a small
hustler with plenty of court moxie.
Stevenson, looking better than ever,
has been fitted with contact lenses

powerful soph, who has been fighting
the cold bug.
Tomsic fits in at the other forward
position in the second unit. He shows
a lot for a first-year man and should

first-string. Dave Epperson, rangy
