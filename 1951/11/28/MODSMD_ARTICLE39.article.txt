# Towering Brave Cagers To Meet Fremont High
## 
### HARRY MARTIN 
Stanford's polished hardwoods
will host the opening of the 1951-52
basketball season this Friday night
at 6 when, in a preliminary contest,
Gus Chavalas' jayvees meet Fre-

Mont High School of Oakland.
This year's edition of the
Braves will display a fast-break
ing, aggressive style which fea
tures a full court press. This is
the same style of ball head bas
ketball mentor Bob Burnett is
teaching and hopes to employ in
varsity games.
The Chavalas-coached crew will
average six feet plus which indi
cates an effort to control both back
boards. The tentative starting line

up as announced by Coach Chavalas
has two JC transfers and four I
freshmen vying for positions on the
opening five.
Chavalas has Russ Lawler, a 6-ft.
6-in. giant and tallest man on the i
squad, and Howie Schwartz, G ft. 4
in., at forwards; John Ramsey, 6 ft.
4Va in., at center; and George Caras,
6 ft., Jim Johnson, 6 ft., or Dick ;
Hughes, 6 ft. 1 in., at the two guard
slots.
With height like this, (ins
should he up in the clouds, but,
on the contrary, he is worrying
about a toufth shcdulc which tabs
the Braves to play four games
within five days at the start of
the season.
After meeting Fremont this Fri
day night, the jayvees go on to en
tertain San Mateo JC the following
night and come right back to face
the COP and St. Mary's jayvees on
Monday and Tuesday nights, res
pectively.
