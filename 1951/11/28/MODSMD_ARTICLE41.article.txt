# Daily Parodies Ratio, Rossott's, Western Civ

### WALT MENNINGER 
"ASSU may sound like something you'd utter when sneezing,
but it really means Associated Students of Stanford University."
So begins The Daily Californian in their Big Game edition—
a parody on Stanford. The newsheet across the Bay, in its annual
Big Game blast, gives forth with interpretations of the Stanford
ratio. Rossotti's, ASSU President I

Wayne Alley, women's regulations.
The Daily, and Farm classes —
among other things.
The highlight of the edition is
reached in the story on Rossotti's.
Writes a 'reporter from the "Mon
arch of the College Dailies":
"A general impression that most
people have of Stanford men is that
they are tall, blond, smooth shaven,
crew-cutted adonises, having a gay
old time on the Farm doing things
that college men are supposed to
do . . . and one thing college men
are supposed to do is go out and get
drunk every night.
"This, Stanford men certainly
do — only you wouldn't know it
looking around the place. It's
quieter than the California root
ing section was at the UCLA
game. . . . You see, Mrs. Stanford
mustn't know.
"If she only thought to take a
hike three miles up the road, she
would be snapped out of her leth
argy. . . . There, at a place called
Rossotti's, can be found scads of
Stanford men (and women), each
in his (or her) cups, singing 'Come
Join the Band' beneath a sign which
in bold lights says, 'Beat Cal—Drink
Lucky Lager Beer'."

Speaking of Stanford women, the
Daily Californian is confused, to say
the least. "Stanford women lead a
very confusing life. They have all
kinds of problems.
"The lockout system is confus
ing, their 'social standards' in
comfvehensible, and the housing
situation completely unfathom
able." The Cal coed reporter then
proceeds to get completely lost in
the maze of information on those
subjects. Some Farm coeds claim
that she isn't the only one!
The shortage qf women at Stan
ford proves to be another interest
ing subject for the "Monarch of the
Dailies" to tackle. Comments the
UC newspaper, "Stanford is a ratio.
Talk to anyone on the Farm about
social life and they tell you about
the 'ratio.' Too many boys and not
enough girls!"
Continuing that angle, the Cal
paper concludes, (A typical Stan
ford student) "decides that in or
der not to he a social Hop. he'll
need a car, money, ingenuity, and
a steady girl back home!"
Stanford classes aren't missed in
the comprehensive survey which
the Daily Cal makes. "What we dis
like most of all is the remark that
the Stanford Reds habitually make,
'Classes at the "impersonal" Uni
versity of California are too big;
Stanford's largest class is, at least,
equal to ours in size, perhaps a
little larger.
"Down on the Farm there is a
freshman history course with about
1,000 students. There doesn't seem
to be anything up here to match
that 'intimate' mob!"
