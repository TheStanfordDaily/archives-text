# Cave-Hunters Speak Tonight
## 
### 
While most Stanfordites were
getting ready to eat their Thanks
! giving dinners, two members of the
Stanford Speleological Society, Ed
Danehy and Art Lange, entered the
"Cave of the Catacombs," near San
Andreas in Calaveras County.
Known as early as 1850 by set
tlers in the Mother Lode, the "Cave
of the Catacombs" contained hun
dreds of bones, some of which were
at least a century old. An old In
dian legend tells how the site was
used as a prison by the Indians,
| who used to throw their victims in
and let them die of starvation.
Excavations of the Indian remains
were carried out until 1881 by the
California State Mining Bureau, but
the location of the cave was virtu
ally forgotten until Danehy and
Lange rediscovered it.
Tonight at 7 in Room 364, Geology
1 corner, both Ed and Art will de
scribe their exploits over the past
weekend. Lange will also describe
| a recent expedition to Magdalena
Bay, on the Gulf of California in
j Mexico. Color slides of some jea
j caves in that area will be shown.
