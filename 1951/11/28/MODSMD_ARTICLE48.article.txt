# Red Roses on Tower Flag Show Signs of Indians
## 
### 
"Roses for the Team" is the mes
sage proclaimed by the banner on
top of Hoover Tower. On either
side of the lettering is a big, red
rose. Inspection with powerful bi
noculars and a telescope from the
Physics Department revealed these
facts yesterday.
The banner is securely attached
to the west side of the top dome
and shows no signs of fluttering in
the wind. Itopes were used to tie
it around the curved cement sur
face of the dome.
The "flag pole" does not belong
on Hoover, but is a pole erected by
the persons responsible for the job
and is painted red. A red rose about
a foot in diameter was fastened on
the tip of the pole with streamers
flying from the pole ;>nd supports.
Since its first appearance Sun
day morning, the pole has broken
in the middle and the top and
now rests cm tho edge of the
dome near the upper left edge of
the banner.
Attempts to trace the "who" and
"how" have met with little success
so far, although the evidence of the
message on the banner and the red
streamers points to Stanford stu
dents.


THE PLOT THICKENS—As seen
through fog and a telescope, the
Hoover Tower banner bares its
message. Yet to be found are the
culprits responsible for the deed.
