When the winds of freedom began to blow in Berlin in 1047, the
storm that followed was practically a hurricane, Lieselotte Berger,
traveling secretary for the World Student Service Fund, told Stan
ford students this week.
Miss Berger speaks with authority since she is also a student

at the Free University of Berlin,
which was set up two years ago to
offer .students in West and East
Germany a curriculum free from
poltiical control.
The university was built up under
circumstances of extreme hardship,
according to Miss Berger, who wit
nessed its foundation. There were
few desks, books, sometimes no
electricity at all, and a diet con
sisting almost entirely of ersatz po
tatoes. Moreover, a lot of the pro
fessors and students were destitute
political refugees from the Eastern
Zone.
"It was at this time," Miss Ber
ger said, '"that 4,000 pounds of
food arrived by air lift from the
students of Stanford University.
At first we couldn't believe it. It
took us ten days to figure out
how we were going to distribute
it."
Stanford and the Free University
of Berlin this year have set up an
exchange student program. Phil
Nielson is Stanford's representative
in Berlin and Hella Reglin is study
ing here.
But Nielson is not the only Stan
ford student at the university this
year. "We call all of our students
who have received clothes from
Stanford 'Stanford students'," Miss
Berger explained.
Stanfoid's aid during this crucial
period, however, could not put an
end to the university's problems al
together. About 70 per cent of the

Miss Berger will speak to Ex
coin tonight at 7:30. At 8, she
will speak and show a movie on
the foundation of tlie Eree Uni
versity of Berlin at an open meet
ing of International Club's For
eign Student Discussion Group in
the auditorium of the Women's
Clubhouse. All students interest
ed in hearing Miss Berber may
attend the"I" Club meeting. Cof
fee will be served.

students living in the Eastern Zone,
Miss Berger estimates, are non-
Communists. They are not allowed
to read Western newspapers, they
cannot attempt to learn anything
beyond the government-established
curriculum, and most of them have
spent time in jail as political pris
oners.
In an effort to reach these stu
dents behind the Iron Curtain,
Miss Berger arid her fellow stu
dents do all they can. "As stu
dents it makes no difference
whom we help," she said.
Books, food, money, and even let
ters of encouragement are sent
anonymously to these people. They
are taken care of when they come
to the Western Zone as refugees,
and there is a kind of underground
communications system between the
two zones operated by students at
the Free University.
"Being fortunate to live in the
free part of the world, we have the
duty to help those who are sup
pressed a.s much as possible We
have to strengthen their faiti so
that they can make their decisions
by their own free will," Mis ■ Ber
ger says. "We have got to try our
very best and we ought not to fail."
