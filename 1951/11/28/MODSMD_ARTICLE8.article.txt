# Pledges Remodel Barn for Scouts
## 
### 
In another "Help Week" project,
pledges of the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon social fraternity and Alpha Phi
Omega service fraternity are co
operating by remodeling an old barn
on campus to be used as a meeting
place for Boy Scout Troop 51 of
the Stanford Area Council.
The SAE pledges will spend three
: afternoons this week leveling the
dirt floor of the barn to prepare it
! for black-top covering. They will
| also clear the ground around the
I building of weeds and trash which
| are now a fire hazard.
The job of re-roofing the barn
was one of the A Phi O pledge
|.v«;jects, and that work has lieen
completed. The shingles for the
re-roofing were provided by the
service fraternity.
Working on the barn are SAE
pledges James Flynn, Howard
Hertz, Ben Lambiotte, Mike Men
singei\ Edward Riordan, and Ru ty
Russell, and A Phi O pledges Dick
liiown, Allen Ivey, John Matthews,
and Galen Preble.
The long-abandoned barn is lo
cated off Escondido Road, back of
the Hacienda to the east of Stern
Hall approximately a quarter mile.
I The Scouts decided to remodel the
j barn and u-e it as a meeting place
earlier this year.
The final remodeling of the barn
| will l>e accomplished by the Scouts
themselves.


"HELP" INSTEAD OK "HELL"—Four SAE pledges begin work on the floor of a barn which is
