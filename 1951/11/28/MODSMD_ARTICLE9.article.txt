Bv PAT KING
The first performance of Profes
sor Leonard Ratner's choral setting
of 47, "O Clap Your Hands,
All Ye People," highlighted the mu
sical program given by the Univer
sity Chorus and the Memorial
Church Choir at the Tuesday Eve
ning Series last night.
Professor Harold C. Schmidt led
the chorus in a brilliant rendition of
this powerfully dramatic â€¢ piece
which shows Ratner's technical skill
and his excellent mastery of choral
resources.
Professor Ratner made the fol
lowing comment on the piece:
"The 47th Psalm is a triumphant
song of faith. In this setting full
sonorities of a mixed chorus are
set against brilliant fanfare In
ures of the pianos to project the
affective qualities of the text.
The middle section, in contrast, is
set in a style reci ll ng the motet
techniques <if Renaissance sacred
music."
The University Chorus opened
the program with three selections
from Handel's "Solomon." The first
chorus, a bright, joyful number,
contrasted with the melancholy
tempo of the second selection. The
third was light with a lilting mel
ody. The choir al. o sang several
choruses from "King David" by Ar
thur Honegger.
The Memorial Church Choir gave
an inspiring performance of several
religious .*ongs. Outstanding v/as
"Let Thy Holy Pre ;ence" by Ches
nokor. The voice quality of the
choir was generally better than
that of the chorus, and they added
much richness and depth to the
songs.
