CLEANERS
SUGGEST THAT YOU
1. Have all your clothes cleaned or laundered by
them, so you won't have to take home a suitcase
of dirty laundry.
2. Leave your blankets with them. Vacation is the
time to have your blankets cleaned and moth
proofed by our experts. We'll store them until
you return at no extra charge. If the binding is
old let us replace it for you with your choice of
quality bindings. All work is guaranteed.
