# Reds Choke Talks
## 
### 
TOKYO The delegates already
were threatened with a deadlock on
means of safeguarding a Korean ;u -
mistice once one is signed, and the
Communist insistence oti discussing
withdrawal of foreign troops com
plicated the delicate issue.
The Communsits openly opposed
an Allied armistice plan to freeze
the armed strength of both sides
and to give inspection teams the
free range of all Korea.
The situation was further clouded
by renewed Communist demands
for the withdrawal of all foreign
troops from Korea â€”a demand the
Allies said could not be discussed at
the present military conferences.
