# Hoover Tower Banner Still Flies
## Paly Times Suspects Daily 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
"Who put the streamers on
top of Hoover Tower?" asks the
Paly Times. The mystery is still
unsolved, contrary to the Times'
hint that the Daily staff knows
more than it's printing.
An inside job with inside co-op
eration is the theory held by Hoo
ver Tower officials as the result
of investigations yesterday. Three
members of the Hoover si: IT and a
Daily reporter climbed up as far
.is is possible in the tower.
Execution of the job has been
proved pos: ible from the inside of
the tower. A vertical lnr'dcr ex
tends from the sixteenth floor level
n]) through the floor of the lighted
dome second from the top.
Only the little bulb which now
bears the banner and pole sur
mounts this portion of the tower.
A heavy iron trap door, which is
raised by hand, permit entrance to
the small circular-walled chamber.

Experienced mountain climbers
would have been able to make use
of a ledge about eight inches wide
which surrounds the lighted dome
several feet below the windows.
Standing on this narrow ledge,
they could have tossed ropes over
the top ot the dome and the round
ed hulb on top, climbed up, and
erected the pole with wires.
The fastening of the banner with
ropes was less difficult, but the
prospect of a 285-foot drop broken
only by bone-crushing ricochets off
domes and cornices would deter
most tower climbers.
Investigation 01" the elaborate sign
raising has ruled out the helicopter
theory. Investigators estimate that
at least three men and possibly four
were required for the job and that
no "whir-plane" could carry that
many passengers.
The Palo Alto Times questioned
yesterday's Daily picture of the
tower sign. The picture was taken
by a Speed-Graphic camera through
a high-powered telescope borrowed
from the Physics Department. The

picture was snapped from the north
steps of the Education Building.
The picture became blurred due
to mechanical difficulties, and it was
necessary for the outlines of the
snap hot to he retouched.
