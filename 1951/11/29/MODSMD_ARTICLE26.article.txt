# Excom Asks 18-Year-old Legal Age for 'Beer, Wine'
## Resolution Approved Unanimously; 21-Year Minimum Called Unrealistic 
### 
ASSU Excom went on record as tavoring a lowering of the legal
minimum drinking age to 18 for "beer, ale, and unfortified wines,"
last night. A resolution to this effect was approved unanimously.
Commenting on the action, ASSU President Wayne Alley said,
"Because this touches student affairg so closely, we feel the ex-

ecutive committee should avoid
both hypocrisy and pussy-footing.
To deny a problem exists is to play
ihe ostrich."
The resolution was approved af
ter a 4U-minute discussion of "the
committee as a whule," during
which at least four different pro
posals were discussed. These were:
lowering the legal aye to 18 for all
alcoholic beverages; lowering the
age to 19; allowing high school
graduates to purchase and consume
uch Leverages; requiring notarized
parental consent.
Ex coin's resolution, which was
not formally drawn up last night,
will include a recommendation
that eligible youths he required to
carry a state-authorized identifi
cation as proof of their age.
Excom also wanted to go on rec
ord as recognizing the social prob
lems attendant to drinking and
realizing that college youth are a
minority ol those involved.
Student manager George Den
ny, who moved passage of the
resolution, suggested that the 21-
year-old legal minimum is arbi
trary, unrealistic, and less justi
fied than an 18-year-old mini
mum. Alley said he felt the pres
ent law is not "dealing with the
problem adequately."
Alley also thought the line be
tween a 17- and an 18-year-old is
more easily recognizable than that
between 20 and 21.
Excom approved constitutions for
two student organizations, View
point Magazine and the Stanford
Press Club. The magazine's con
stitution charters the Stanford Lit
erary Association, similar in func
tion to Chaparral's Hammer and
Cottin Society, whose members will
be held financially responsible for
any debts of the magazine.
Eight members of the Funda
mental Standard Committee were
given Excom approval. They are
Dick Klein, chairman, Stan Blu
menthal, John Begg, Tom Blount,
Suzie Reichert, Joyce Bryson, and
carryovers Emmie Lou Fred hold
and Mary Spiegel.
The resignation of Joan Symon
J'rom Women's Council was accept
ed by Excom. Miss Symon, a law
student, resigned because of aca
demic considerations.
It was Excom'.s last meeting of
the quarter, barring an emergency
>ession.
