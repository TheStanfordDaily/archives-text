# Who's Confused?

Some people seem to have taken The Daily
Californian's articles on Stanford seriously.
Below there is a letter to the editor lauding Cal's
appraisal of Stanford's social regulations, which
was reprinted in yesterday's Daily. The Daily
Cal commented that "Stanford women lead a
very confusing life. They have all kinds of
problems. The lockout system is confusing,
their 'social standards' incomprehensible . .
The number of Stanford women who have
found the present demerit system confusing
or incomprehensible, however, is negligible
according to statistics released by Miss Brown,
Dean of Women, at a meeting Tuesday night
with Women's Council.
Only 7.7% of undergraduate women have
accumulated one demerit since the present
system was inaugurated in 1949; 4.2% have
accumulated 2 demerits; .06%, 3 demerits; and
.04%, 4 demerits, leaving 88% who have ac
quired less than one demerit. Only one stu
dent has been dismissed for the accumulation

of five demerits since the demerit system has
been in operation.
It is interesting to note that Cal's social regu
lations resemble a system that once existed at
Stanford which was voted out in favor of the
present demerit plan. Women students at Cal
receive late leaves on the basis of their aca
demic standing. Such a reward and punish
ment basis of social regulations was found dis
tasteful by Stanford women under the old lock
out system, where a girl was restricted to her
residence for violations, or her late leaves were
reduced when her grades fell below average.
The present system of social regulations is
completely independent of academic standing
or arbitrary control by living groups. Individ
ual responsibility and not punishment is its
basis.
■i Perhaps this type of system might seem con
fusing and incomprehensible to our friends
across the Bay, but it appears to be working
quite successfully here.—S.G.
