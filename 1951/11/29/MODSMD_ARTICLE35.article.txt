## A 						Cameraman Complains 
### 
(Editor's note: The following excerpt, from a story
in Monday's Daily, is referred to in the letter below.)
"Again Saturday, the newsreel jinx prevailed.
Two years ago before the Michigan game, the
newsreel cameramen asked Farm rooters to
chcer as if the Big Red had just scored a touch
down. The rooters complied. Michigan won.
"In the '49 Big Game, the same request was
made, but in defiance of the cameramen, the
rooters chanted "We remember Michigan." As
chance would have it, just then the Stanford
JV's scored a touchdown, the students cheercd
. . . and the cameras rolled. California won.
"Saturday, the newsreel cameras rolled again."
To the Editor:
This sort of stuff is below the caliber of a university
paper. If you want more material, I forgot to put a
penny in my left shoe Saturday also.
Those fellows earn their living doing a job that re
quires them to be several places at once. They expect
to run into ignorant and superstitious attitudes in the

back-woods. Such nonsense stories as this by make
believe journalists in college only adds to their woes.
This story adds nothingâ€”and does harm.
Editors arc supposed to decide to what extent then
papers will cater to mob-psycholocy and to what ex
tent they will lead away from it. It should be an easy
decision 011 a college paper.
