# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK McLEAN 
TIIE QUARTERLY ROUNDUP
This will he the last Bull Session of the quarter for
me and I thought I'd summarize a bit before I pack
up the portable typewriter and go home for the holi
days.
I think this quarter has been a pretty good one. The
panic of the new liquor law has subsided. This doesn't
mean that it is forgotten but the lack of conflict shows

that Stanford students can use
their heads about difficult laws.
Our administration did a fine job
of informing us of the new act and
its implications. This undoubtedly
saved a few nccks. (Did you
know that the bunch from UCLA
hadn't even heard of the new
law?)
Rally Com, that much kidded
organization, did another good job
this year. It seems that they often

take a little more ribbing than they deserve, ihc
hackneyed jokes about the saddle shoes and the un
necessary army of young freshman lovelies are always
good for a few more chuckles. To kid Rally Com is
one thing, to make a joke of Rally Com, another. If
we consider the huge job of planning and producing
rallies and keeping the spirit high throughout Ihc
whole season, we sec that they serve a worthwhile
and important function. Besides, who minds watching
the pompom girls during the time outs?
} Chuck and (he team were enough in themselves
t'i make this year a rosy one. Before the season
started Stanford was rated about fourth in the Pa
< ific Coast Conference. Under Stanford-grown Tay
lor we methodically began to knock over opponents.
A whisper—almost a rumor—began to eddy over
Quad. (Sic —to move as a currcnt of air or water
running contrary to the main currents.) It was
spoken in hushed, reverent tones. And then in the
smog filled Coliseum after one of the most spec
tacular fourth quarters in football history, it ex

ploded into the open with a stunning blast. ROSE
BOWL.
"Beat Cal" was another battle slogan. But with
Stanfordian stoicism we now say resolutely. "Next
year."
The issue of the foreign language requirement found
a little fresh air this quarter. I thought the response
to the problem was good in that it showed a healthy
interest. The Student-Faculty Education Commission
has the matter under discussion now. Changes are
promised. I hope the changes arc adequate and the
promises kept.
It's been a real pleasure to write Bull Sessions for
the last ten weeks. It's given me some pretty good
laughs too.
Perhaps you remember the column on how to write
to relatives for a few extra dollars. The first letter
concerned itself with a person who said that lie was
in the hospital with pneumonia and hinted strongly
for ten dollars to buy life-giving penicillin.
One girl thought it would be fine sport to have one
of her friends copy the letter verbatim and mail it
down south to her mother. Apparently the girl's
mother didn't appreciate the humor. When Sally got
home from the football game there was a frantic tele
phone call from Southern California. It took twenty
minutes awl twelve dollars in toll charges to soothe the
alarmed parent.
Not long after thai Sally broke her hand. When
she wrote her mother what had happened, her
mother just laughed and laughed. "My youngster is
such a jokester," she replied. "You can't fool me
twice."
Go ahead and laugh but it's no fun to be hit on
the head with a cast.
# * *

Lot me he the first to wish you a MERRY CHRIST
MAS and a HAPPY NEW YEAR.
Stay loose for finals.
See you in Pasadena on New Year's Day when (he
afternoon after is going to be bigger than the night
before.

TIIE QUARTERLY ROUNDUP
This will he the last Bull Session of the quarter for
me and I thought I'd summarize a bit before I pack
up the portable typewriter and go home for the holi
days.
I think this quarter has been a pretty good one. The
panic of the new liquor law has subsided. This doesn't
mean that it is forgotten but the lack of conflict shows

that Stanford students can use
their heads about difficult laws.
Our administration did a fine job
of informing us of the new act and
its implications. This undoubtedly
saved a few nccks. (Did you
know that the bunch from UCLA
hadn't even heard of the new
law?)
Rally Com, that much kidded
organization, did another good job
this year. It seems that they often

take a little more ribbing than they deserve, ihc
hackneyed jokes about the saddle shoes and the un
necessary army of young freshman lovelies are always
good for a few more chuckles. To kid Rally Com is
one thing, to make a joke of Rally Com, another. If
we consider the huge job of planning and producing
rallies and keeping the spirit high throughout Ihc
whole season, we sec that they serve a worthwhile
and important function. Besides, who minds watching
the pompom girls during the time outs?
} Chuck and (he team were enough in themselves
t'i make this year a rosy one. Before the season
started Stanford was rated about fourth in the Pa
< ific Coast Conference. Under Stanford-grown Tay
lor we methodically began to knock over opponents.
A whisper—almost a rumor—began to eddy over
Quad. (Sic —to move as a currcnt of air or water
running contrary to the main currents.) It was
spoken in hushed, reverent tones. And then in the
smog filled Coliseum after one of the most spec
tacular fourth quarters in football history, it ex

ploded into the open with a stunning blast. ROSE
BOWL.
"Beat Cal" was another battle slogan. But with
Stanfordian stoicism we now say resolutely. "Next
year."
The issue of the foreign language requirement found
a little fresh air this quarter. I thought the response
to the problem was good in that it showed a healthy
interest. The Student-Faculty Education Commission
has the matter under discussion now. Changes are
promised. I hope the changes arc adequate and the
promises kept.
It's been a real pleasure to write Bull Sessions for
the last ten weeks. It's given me some pretty good
laughs too.
Perhaps you remember the column on how to write
to relatives for a few extra dollars. The first letter
concerned itself with a person who said that lie was
in the hospital with pneumonia and hinted strongly
for ten dollars to buy life-giving penicillin.
One girl thought it would be fine sport to have one
of her friends copy the letter verbatim and mail it
down south to her mother. Apparently the girl's
mother didn't appreciate the humor. When Sally got
home from the football game there was a frantic tele
phone call from Southern California. It took twenty
minutes awl twelve dollars in toll charges to soothe the
alarmed parent.
Not long after thai Sally broke her hand. When
she wrote her mother what had happened, her
mother just laughed and laughed. "My youngster is
such a jokester," she replied. "You can't fool me
twice."
Go ahead and laugh but it's no fun to be hit on
the head with a cast.
