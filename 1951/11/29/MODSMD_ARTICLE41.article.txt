# Dr. Buss Reports on Malaya Communism
## 
### 
There are signs that the Com
munists are playing a losing
game, it was reported from the
Orient by Dr. Claude A. Buss,
Stanford professor of history
and former Far Eastern diplo
mat.
Writing from Singapore to a col
league at Stanford, Dr. Buss said:
"Most encouraging has been the
attitude of the overseas Chinese.
They arc fed up with conditions in
China. Instead of more pro-Com
munist, they are more anti-Com
munist. Mao's regime of personal
torture and extortion does not go
down with the 10,000,000 overseas
Chinese.
Dr. Buss, now traveling in the Far
East under a Rockefeller Founda
tion travel grant, had this to say
about Singapore:
"Singapore seems half a world
away from the things which arc
vital to most Americans, yet un
derneath the surface its life is in
timately connected with our own.
Its prosperity is measured in
terms of tin and rubber, and the
market depends upon American
purchases. Stock-piling and post-
Korea scare - buying have shot
prices skyward. Sales arc good
and dividends arc better. A good
price for tin and rubber is of
more practical value here than an
ECA program or an expanded
Voice of America.
"But here everybody talks about
the Emergency. They don't mean
Korea. They mean the bandits
across the causeway in the jungles
of Malaya.
"A quarter of a million men—
British, Gurkhas, Malays, and even
a few Chinese—arc under arms try
ing to bring to terms a well-or
ganized Chinese Communist bandit
force which probably numbers no
more than 5,000 men. Trains are
derailed, innocent people killed ev
ery day, and tin mines and rubber
plantations are virtually armed
camps.
"For almost three years this
Emergency - Revolution - War, or
whatever you call it, has been go
ing on. It costs a lot; last year
the British figured il cost $200,000
to kill every bandit who was
bagged.
"The army, the police, the Coast
Guard, the Royal Air Force all
together have not found the magic
formula which would lick the
jungle and the bandits and squat

tors who would take advantage
of it.
"A new British government is in
power, a new Director of Operations
is coming out to take over, but no
one sees a quick or happy end to
the Emergency.
"Singapore is the last of the great
pre - war colonial administrations.
The handwriting on the wall which
spells out nationalism and self
government is beginning to be seen
even here. The British have given
good government; they have made
it possible for Malays, Indians, Chi
nese, and Europeans to live together
in peace and profit.
"Some say now (hat is not
enough. Cooler heads advise
peaceful transition to self - gov
ernment and none of the precipi
tate changes which have produced
so much chaos in neighboring
areas.
"Of course, the Communists
would like to have it otherwise.
They say 'Down with imperial
ism, long live chaos!'"
Dr. Buss writes with a back
ground of seven years' experience
with the United States Foreign
Servicc in the Orient and war-time
service as executive assistant to the
United States High Commissioner
in the Philippines and later as head
of the San Francisco bureau of the
Office of War Information.
He has been a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1946.
