Today wc take to using an eraser.
As you know erasers arc used for correcting mistakes. If mistakes
were not made, there would he no erasers. We made a mistake and a good
one in picking Stanford over California.
Seven weeks ago we went out on the limb and picked Stanford to go un
defeated if they got by Washington. That they did, and although the USC
tilt loomed as a toughic, the Trojans fell, and wc thought it was clear sailing
ahead. The Big Game was to be easy. But in our prognosticating we forgot
one thing. This was to be the Big Game, where upsets are the rule, not the
exception.
Oh sure, some say that Stanford was not high for the game, that we
didn't get the breaks, or that this should have been done, or that should have
been done. But as we see it, the fault was not ours, but the blame for our
defeat rests with California.
The Bears iust had too much for Stanford last Saturday. Whether they
were really as good as they looked, or playing way over their heads, is
difficult to say, but whatever the cause California was one of the finest
teams that particular Saturday that has ever invaded Stanford Stadium.
They Say Turnabout is Fair Play
Let's not overlook the fact that it was only last year that Stanford did
the same thing to California. The Bears were bowl bound, and without
a loss in regular season play since the middle of 1947. So what happened,
the Indians who only had a mediocre year, rose to the occasion and played
the Bears to a 7 to 7 deadlock, in a game which was as surprising as this
year's upset. So we suppose that turn about is fair play; but it was a shocker,
but of course most Big Games are.
One last thought on the Big Game: Perhaps the poster that was tacked
to the dressing room wall before the Oregon State game was taken down
a week early. It pleaded: IT ONLY TAKES SIXTY MINUTES TO
MAKE CHUMPS OUT OF CHAMPS.
Now that Stanford is in the Rose Bowl, there is one thing for sure and
that is if Stanford wins the Pasadena titanic we can point our fingers proudly
at Bcrkcleyites and say something to the effect, that wc did in one try what
you arc still trying to do after three .straight failures. That is to win a Rose
Bowl.
Stanford to Whip Illinois
We are somewhat hesitant to venture on who will win the Rose Bowl
after our personal setback. But not one to say die we rise again to proudly
go along with the Indians to get by Illinois. We submit to the claim of many,
that, the Fighting Illini are a top team who boast a good record of eight wins
and one tie against stiff opposition. Nevertheless wc feel that Stanford
learned a severe lesson Saturday and are ready to do a bit of their own
teaching. This squad is just a little more than anxious to erase what hap
pened and it will take a Rose Bowl win to do it.
Wc believe that the fiasco last week was the spark that is going to fire
this 1951 Stanford Varsity to new heights and give the Pacific Coast Con
ference its first win over a Big Ten team in the Bowl since the PCC-Big Ten
pact was signed six years back.
Speaking of Illinois, the Rose Bowl will mark only the first of three
battles the Cards will do with the Big Tcners. Already on the Stanford
home schedule for Oct. 3, 1953 is Illinois, and in 1954 the Iniuns return
the favor by going to Champaign to do combat. Incidentally with the
exception of those games, the intcrsectional schedule is bare.
Basketball Bounces Back
It's gotten around to that time of the year when Basketball zooms into
full prominence. Friday night the Stanford Varsity under new coach Bob
Burnett takes to the hardwood against Cal Poly and on Saturday return to
meet the alumni, in a good old Stanford family struggle, which will see a
lot of good ball players in action.
And for the first time since the war days, Stanford freshmen will be
eligible as varsity basbetballcrs. While it is unlikely that any will crack
the initial five, they will sec full action as substitutes and regulars on the
Brave squad. The Braves under the tutelage of former card eager Gus
Chavalas open their 24 game season against Fremont High Friday in a
varsity prelim with tip of! at 6:00.
By way of note. The Brave first string averages a measly 6'3".

A memorable quote was that of Bobby Grayson at the Big Game Rally
Thursday. The ex-Stanford great opined, "I'm not prejudiced; I don't
care who beats California."
