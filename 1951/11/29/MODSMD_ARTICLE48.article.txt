# Sports The Stanford Daily
## Baseball in November Is Theme for Dean's Squad 
### 
It's baseball in November these days for 70 Stanford enthusiasts
who are taking the calendar in stride. Baseball in the rain? "Why,
that just puts the field in ideal condition for sliding practice,"
smiles Coach Everett Dean.
Dean, now able to put in a full-time stint as baseball coach, has

stressed informality in the fall phys
ed class he has supervised since early
October. Right now there is none of
the intensity of a CIBA campaign on
the Sunken Diamond, none of the
applause for a sparkling double play.
"We're all out there in the fall be
cause we love the game," Dean ob
serves. "We want to give everyone
who has the urge a chance to cotm»
out, learn the fundamentals, and have
some fun."
By "wc" Dean includes his staff of
Billy Alhouse, last year's frosh coach,
and Dick Clegg, Bill Hcrron, and Jack
Alexander from the '51 varsity.
Intra-squad Games Played
Much of the fun of the fall worko its
has come from regulation games
played twice a week among mem
bers of a four-team league chosen by
the staff. Team captains, all of whom
have varsity experience, arc Joe Chez
and Jim Agar, Bob Murphy and Dick
Cole, Jack Shepard and Art Abra
hamson, and Roger Osenbaugh and
Dick Corzine. The Oscnbaugh-Cor
zine entry leads the league.
Aside from the old standbys, a
number of newcomers have looked
good in the fall games. Rich Scrama
glia, all-city second baseman from
San Francisco, has pulled a Gil Mc-
Dougald by shifting to third without
any strain. Little Rich may make
Stanford fans happy about the fresh
man eligibility rule.
A 1 Talboy of Paly High fame will
give punch to the Indians' lefthanded
batting attack. Talboy can play about
any position, but will probably settle
in the outfield. He comes to the Farm
via Menlo J.C. and San Jose State.
Shortstop Warren Goodrich, co-cap
tain of last year's freshman team,
has benefited from a summer of ball
in Pendleton, Oregon. Goodrich
showed flashes of brilliance this sum
mer, reaching his defensive peak in
the Oregon amateur tournament in
September. His work in the Portland
tourney was good enough to earn
him the title "best infield prospect
ever seen at Westmoreland Park."
Dean, however, is all too aware that
press clippings won't win ball games
in the CIBA, and is glad to sec com
petition developing at every position.
Many New Faces
Other new faces who have caught
Dean's attention include Mike Acker,
Phil Page, Don DeLong, Jack God
dard, Ray Highsmith, Dave Freeman,
and Ken Brown, pitchers; Clarke
Nelson and Len Schwartz, catchers;
Dick Hughes, first base; Talboy and
Sid Hall, second base; Chuck Burke
and Jim Bush, shortstop; Talboy,
Bob Burdick, Terry Evans, and Ralph
Cassiday, third base ;and Ray Swarts,
Pete Reynolds, Gordon Galloway,
Dwight Luman, and George Shott,
outfielders.
Those arc the boys who will be
vying for starting slots with Letter
men Shepard, Corzine, Osenbaugh,
Chez, Murphy, Hennacy, Abraham
son. Cole, and Agar.
If plans go through, local fans will
get a look at some topnotch profes
sional talent in the Sunken Diamond
next spring. Dean has written the
San Francisco Seals, Oakland Oaks,
and Chicago White Sox for games,
and may catch the Pittsburgh Pirates,
Cleveland Indians, and New York
Giants in a mood for a campus game
on their way north to play the Seals.

Phil Page, Don DeLong, Jack God
dard, Ray Highsmith, Dave Freeman,
and Ken Brown, pitchers; Clarke
Nelson and Len Schwartz, catchers;
Dick Hughes, first base; Talboy and
Sid Hall, second base; Chuck Burke
and Jim Bush, shortstop; Talboy,
Bob Burdick, Terry Evans, and Ralph
Cassiday, third base ;and Ray Swarts,
Pete Reynolds, Gordon Galloway,
Dwight Luman, and George Shott,
outfielders.
Those arc the boys who will be
vying for starting slots with Letter
men Shepard, Corzine, Osenbaugh,
Chez, Murphy, Hennacy, Abraham
son. Cole, and Agar.
If plans go through, local fans will
get a look at some topnotch profes
sional talent in the Sunken Diamond
next spring. Dean has written the
San Francisco Seals, Oakland Oaks,
and Chicago White Sox for games,
and may catch the Pittsburgh Pirates,
Cleveland Indians, and New York
Giants in a mood for a campus game
on their way north to play the Seals.
It's baseball in November these days for 70 Stanford enthusiasts
who are taking the calendar in stride. Baseball in the rain? "Why,
that just puts the field in ideal condition for sliding practice,"
smiles Coach Everett Dean.
Dean, now able to put in a full-time stint as baseball coach, has

stressed informality in the fall phys
ed class he has supervised since early
October. Right now there is none of
the intensity of a CIBA campaign on
the Sunken Diamond, none of the
applause for a sparkling double play.
"We're all out there in the fall be
cause we love the game," Dean ob
serves. "We want to give everyone
who has the urge a chance to cotm»
out, learn the fundamentals, and have
some fun."
By "wc" Dean includes his staff of
Billy Alhouse, last year's frosh coach,
and Dick Clegg, Bill Hcrron, and Jack
Alexander from the '51 varsity.
Intra-squad Games Played
Much of the fun of the fall worko its
has come from regulation games
played twice a week among mem
bers of a four-team league chosen by
the staff. Team captains, all of whom
have varsity experience, arc Joe Chez
and Jim Agar, Bob Murphy and Dick
Cole, Jack Shepard and Art Abra
hamson, and Roger Osenbaugh and
Dick Corzine. The Oscnbaugh-Cor
zine entry leads the league.
Aside from the old standbys, a
number of newcomers have looked
good in the fall games. Rich Scrama
glia, all-city second baseman from
San Francisco, has pulled a Gil Mc-
Dougald by shifting to third without
any strain. Little Rich may make
Stanford fans happy about the fresh
man eligibility rule.
A 1 Talboy of Paly High fame will
give punch to the Indians' lefthanded
batting attack. Talboy can play about
any position, but will probably settle
in the outfield. He comes to the Farm
via Menlo J.C. and San Jose State.
Shortstop Warren Goodrich, co-cap
tain of last year's freshman team,
has benefited from a summer of ball
in Pendleton, Oregon. Goodrich
showed flashes of brilliance this sum
mer, reaching his defensive peak in
the Oregon amateur tournament in
September. His work in the Portland
tourney was good enough to earn
him the title "best infield prospect
ever seen at Westmoreland Park."
Dean, however, is all too aware that
press clippings won't win ball games
in the CIBA, and is glad to sec com
petition developing at every position.
