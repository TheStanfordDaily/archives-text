FINALLY!—After more than an hour's wait, a Stanford co-ed
turns away from the ticket window, clutching her Rose Bowl
ticket in one hand and her change in the other. She appears
surprised, perhaps that she really has the ticket to Pasadena in
her hand. Actually, her wait was shorter than that of students
who tried to "beat ihe crowd" at 8:30 yesterday morning. All
students, however, seemed to agree that the Rose Bowl is worth
waiting for. —Daily photo by Frosty North
