# Braves Board Bowl-Bound Bandwagon; Experts Pick Illini to Carry Off Roses
## Arrowhead Springs to Host Indians for Final Workouts 
### EARL ODELL Sports Editor, Stanford Daily 
Stanford's 1951 PCC championship grid team will resume prac
tice on Dec. 15, following finals, in preparation for the prize of
them all—the Rose Bowl next Jan. 1, when they meet the Uni
versity of Illinois, the Big Ten champ
The Indians will practice on their home field until ChristmaD

The day after, Chuck Taylor and
11i.s staff will take the team south to
give them a final week's workout
before the Big Day. They will hold
drills at Arrowhead Springs arid
will stay at the Arrowhead Springs
Hotel, about six miles from Sari
Bernardino, it was announced last
night by Don Liebendorfer, Stan
ford athletic news director.
Practice Lay-off
Because of PCC regulations, tho
Cards can undergo directed prac
tice with a coaching staff for only 15
days, but earlier this week in a
meeting of the team, it was decided
that the men would keep in top
shape individually until practice
begins again. This presumably
means running in shorts and sweat,
suits (all equipment has been
turned in in accordance with PCC
rules) a mile or two a day.
Chuck Taylor, who previously
placed himself in opposition to post
eason games, told the team in
their meeting that as long as they
arc going to play in the Rose Bowl,
they're going down with one ob
jective —that of winning.
Indians Underdogs
The Indians, in the position of un
derdogs aeainst the Fiehting Illim,
find themselves in a psychological
rpot which they like. Besides t.he
fact, that Illinois will be favored,
the Tribe, having lost their last
game (remember?), realize that it's
going 'o take a iot of hard work
over the holidays before they'll be
ready for the likes of a E>ig Ten
representative
Chuck Taylor will use few, if any,
new plays for the coming battle, and
will, rather, work on perfecting ex
isting patterns. He is undecided
about using the play which Gary
Kerkorian and his crew thought up
in the huddle last Saturday when
Bill McColl took a long lateral from
Kerkorian and threw a 65-yard pass
to Harry Hugasian in the end zone.
lilini Uses T
Stanford will meet in the Tllini a
tpam which uses a T - formation
similar to their own. Led by All-
American halfback Johnny Karras,
Illinois will present a squad de
pending mainly on speed. Unde
feated, but with one tie to their
credit, Illinois has a strong defen:c,
which has a habit, of holding when
it has to.
The Indians, with a couple of All-
Americans themselves — Bill Mo
Coll, first string on every team;
Gary Kerkorian second string on
UP All - American — will counter
with two attacks The Pass (Kerko
rian to McColl) and The Punch
(Mathias, Hugasian, and Cook).
The Card defense, notably out
standing in nine games (we'll forget
the tenth), led by Dick Horn, Jack
Rye, and Hon Eadie. with plenty
of j owcr fiiling in, is expected to
give Karras and his crew a ro'igh
afternoon.
Nation to Watch
The eves oi the nation will Ie on
Stanford Jan. 1. The big question
is whether or not a PCC team can
measure up to the power of a Big
Ten squad in the Rose Bowl, some
thing no Coast team has been able
to do in six years. Stanford hasn't
been tried in those six years, and
■the public wonders if a fresh team
cm) do it.
We think they can!
