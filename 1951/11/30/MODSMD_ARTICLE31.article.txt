# Excom Has Ideas on Liquor
## 
### 
Excom surprised a lot of people Wednesday
night — including us — with lis unexpected
recommendation that the state liquor law be
changed. Excom proposed that iho minimum
legal drinking age be lowered to 18 for beer,
ale and unfortified wine. The group also rec
ommended that eligible youthr be required to
carry a state-authorized identification as proof
of their age.
This plan, adopted after a fairly short dis
cussion, seems logical, or maybe the word is
realistic. It is based on the assumption tha*t
iB is a more logical age than 21 to decide
Ihat men and women have reached the age of
responsible judgment.
Excom felt the present 21 age limit un
realistic, and moreover felt that the present
law invites cheating and all the ingenious
methods devised by youths to get an illegal
glass ol beer. How true.
ASSU President Wayne Alley summed up
the reason why Excom tackled the touchy sub
ject: ". . . We should avoid hypocrisy and
pussy footing. To deny a problem exists is to
play the ostrich." This, we contend, is healthy
idealism.
Nobody's claiming that the problem is now
solved, but certainly it is-a significant move
when a student governing body stops to talk
about liquor and how a state law can be im
proved. Although we would have preferred to
see more thought on the subject and more stu

dent opinion before the surprise recommenda
tion was reached, the plan agreed upon, mainly
engineered by Alley and Business Manager
George Denny, seems sensible to us. Or as
we said before, realistic.
But we wonder a little about public reaction.
It should be pointed out that Excom has ac
complished much this year besides worrying
about liguor. The discussion Wednesday
was, as Chief Counselor for Men Richard
Balch said yesterday, an indication that stu
dent leaders are facing up to a problem.
All members seemed fully cognizant of the
fact that college students are a small minority
of the 18-21 year-olds in the state. The effects
of a change in the law toward all types of youth
were discussed. In short, we can assure the
public that Excom was thinking of others as
well as students.
Even so, it is inevitable that some persons
will gripe about "silly college boys telling us
how to run the world." Resentment will be
stronger than that from those who feel sin
cerely that we must strengthen, rather than
lighten, liquor laws in regard to minors.
To those persons, we would say don't get
too worried about Stanford students and their
habits. This move by Excom simply proves
that student leaders can do their own thinking
about adult problems. Especially when those
adult problems are so close at hand and touch
that legally unhappy age media of 18-21.

Even so, it is inevitable that some persons
will gripe about "silly college boys telling us
how to run the world." Resentment will be
stronger than that from those who feel sin
cerely that we must strengthen, rather than
lighten, liquor laws in regard to minors.
To those persons, we would say don't get
too worried about Stanford students and their
habits. This move by Excom simply proves
that student leaders can do their own thinking
about adult problems. Especially when those
adult problems are so close at hand and touch
that legally unhappy age media of 18-21.
Excom surprised a lot of people Wednesday
night — including us — with lis unexpected
recommendation that the state liquor law be
changed. Excom proposed that iho minimum
legal drinking age be lowered to 18 for beer,
ale and unfortified wine. The group also rec
ommended that eligible youthr be required to
carry a state-authorized identification as proof
of their age.
This plan, adopted after a fairly short dis
cussion, seems logical, or maybe the word is
realistic. It is based on the assumption tha*t
iB is a more logical age than 21 to decide
Ihat men and women have reached the age of
responsible judgment.
Excom felt the present 21 age limit un
realistic, and moreover felt that the present
law invites cheating and all the ingenious
methods devised by youths to get an illegal
glass ol beer. How true.
ASSU President Wayne Alley summed up
the reason why Excom tackled the touchy sub
ject: ". . . We should avoid hypocrisy and
pussy footing. To deny a problem exists is to
play the ostrich." This, we contend, is healthy
idealism.
Nobody's claiming that the problem is now
solved, but certainly it is-a significant move
when a student governing body stops to talk
about liquor and how a state law can be im
proved. Although we would have preferred to
see more thought on the subject and more stu

dent opinion before the surprise recommenda
tion was reached, the plan agreed upon, mainly
engineered by Alley and Business Manager
George Denny, seems sensible to us. Or as
we said before, realistic.
But we wonder a little about public reaction.
It should be pointed out that Excom has ac
complished much this year besides worrying
about liguor. The discussion Wednesday
was, as Chief Counselor for Men Richard
Balch said yesterday, an indication that stu
dent leaders are facing up to a problem.
All members seemed fully cognizant of the
fact that college students are a small minority
of the 18-21 year-olds in the state. The effects
of a change in the law toward all types of youth
were discussed. In short, we can assure the
public that Excom was thinking of others as
well as students.
Even so, it is inevitable that some persons
will gripe about "silly college boys telling us
how to run the world." Resentment will be
