# The 						Honor Code and Cheating
## 
### 
Several recent events—the West Point crib
bing scandal, cheating at Yale, and student
honesty polls conducted at Cornell and UCLA
- have thrown a rather bright spotlight on the
problem of college classroom ethics. In par
ticular, the spotlight has focused on the ques
tion of proctored examinations versus honor
codes.
Most of us at Stanford are pretty well sold
on this honor code of ours. We look at the
results of polls at non-honor code schools like
Cornell and UCLA, indicating almost half of
the students have been guilty of "academic
dishonesty," and think we have something
here.
But Stanford and honor code committees
have long realized that you can't establish an
honor code and let it work by itself. There must
be constant indoctrination and strengthening
of the code. There must be active efforts toward
preserving the code and making it work.
This year's commiitee has come up with an
idea that could go a long way in this respect.
Early next quarter a questionnaire will be dis
tributed to all students to serve a three-fold
purpose
1. Indoctiinatinq students. The committee
feels that pre-reg speeches and sponsors'

talks often fall short of impressing the incom
ing frosh of the seriousness of the code, and
each student's responsibilities toward main
taining it.
2. Strengthening the code in operation by
indicating to the committee special areas in
need of improvement.
3. Determining the extent of cheating at
Stanford by such indirect and probably re
liable result questions as "Have you seen
anyone violating the code in the last two
quarters?"
There is not so much controversy as to the
code itself, basically. Most criticism has arisen
over some of the code's sidebars: "What about
take home tests?" Does this place unwarranted
responsibility on the student? "Should penal
ties vary with the severity of the violation?
In other words, is it more serious to cheat in
a final than in a pop quiz or an out-of-class
paper? These are some of the questions the
poll will ask.
By giving serious consideration to the
questions, you can help the committee do its
job—half the job. The other half, the bigger
half, is yours. It has always been and always
, will be on the individual level in the last
analysis where any honor code succeeds or
fails. —J.M.

questions, you can help the committee do its
job—half the job. The other half, the bigger

Several recent events—the West Point crib
bing scandal, cheating at Yale, and student
honesty polls conducted at Cornell and UCLA
- have thrown a rather bright spotlight on the
problem of college classroom ethics. In par
ticular, the spotlight has focused on the ques
tion of proctored examinations versus honor
codes.
Most of us at Stanford are pretty well sold
on this honor code of ours. We look at the
results of polls at non-honor code schools like
Cornell and UCLA, indicating almost half of
the students have been guilty of "academic
dishonesty," and think we have something
here.
But Stanford and honor code committees
have long realized that you can't establish an
honor code and let it work by itself. There must
be constant indoctrination and strengthening
of the code. There must be active efforts toward
preserving the code and making it work.
This year's commiitee has come up with an
idea that could go a long way in this respect.
Early next quarter a questionnaire will be dis
tributed to all students to serve a three-fold
purpose
1. Indoctiinatinq students. The committee
feels that pre-reg speeches and sponsors'

talks often fall short of impressing the incom
ing frosh of the seriousness of the code, and
each student's responsibilities toward main
taining it.
2. Strengthening the code in operation by
indicating to the committee special areas in
need of improvement.
3. Determining the extent of cheating at
Stanford by such indirect and probably re
liable result questions as "Have you seen
anyone violating the code in the last two
quarters?"
There is not so much controversy as to the
code itself, basically. Most criticism has arisen
over some of the code's sidebars: "What about
take home tests?" Does this place unwarranted
responsibility on the student? "Should penal
ties vary with the severity of the violation?
In other words, is it more serious to cheat in
a final than in a pop quiz or an out-of-class
paper? These are some of the questions the
poll will ask.

questions, you can help the committee do its
job—half the job. The other half, the bigger
half, is yours. It has always been and always
