### PETE GROTHE 
TAYLOR FOR COACH OF THE YEAR

I can't think of a more appropriate way of polish
ing off the last column this quarter than by wishing
you a Merry Christmas and by giving Chuck Taylor
a push for ''Coach of the Year" honors.
Don Liebcndorfer, athletic news publicist. told me
yesterday, "If Chuck isn't coach of the year, I can't
imagine who would he. As long as I've been at Stan
ford (Liebendorfer has been here since 1!I20) I can't
remember a finer coaching iob than that turned in
by Taylor and his staff."
In case you think the only thing a coach does is
diagram plays and turn out for practice five days a
week, you might be interested in Taylor's schedule
during football season. He keeps hours reminiscent

of the English coal miners in pre-
Industrial Revolution times. None
of this 40 hour a week stuff for
Taylor. He works 65 hours if he
works a minute. Hear his sched
ule:
He sets his alarm for 7 a.m., has
a breakfast of coffee and orange
juice, and is at the office by 8 a.m.
He used to eat more before the
rigors ot a head coaching job de
scended on him. On Mondays and

sometimes on other days he is in his office by 7 a.m.
On Mondays, he writes a "coach's letter," a corre
spondence which goes to nil the alumni groups giving
his account of the previous Saturday's game. This is
a new gimmick, invented by Taylor, and it is another
reason why his public relations are so good.
Tayior answers letters until 8:30 ;it which time be
has a staff meeting until 9:30. During that hour, the
coaches do nothing but. discuss personnel changes
and improvements suggested by the previous after
noon's workout. The period between 9:30 and 11:30
is spent running over and over game movies. From
II to 12. Taylor answers more mail, receives visitors,
confers with players, and takes care of much of the
non-technicnl aspects of kickball.
12 p.m. to l.:i(l p.m. are spent fating a hearty meal
and meeting and talking with the various big wheels
in the newspaper, magazine, alumni, and business
world. Its staff meeting time again for the next two
hours, as the mentor.' plot ever\ minute of that
afternoons practice. To paraphrase an automobile
ad, minute for minute, you can't heat a Taylor prac
tice session.

After that, it's the actual practice. Dutch Fehring
takes the defensive linemen, Joe Ruetz the offensive
up-front-men, George Lynn the backfield defenders,
and Pete Kmetovic the offensive backfield. Taylor
supervises the whole affair and divides his time be
tween the various groups.
At U:45 the coaches break bread with the players
nt the training table. By this time, any normal man
would be decked out in his favorite armchair, a pipe
in his hand, and a purring cat on his lap. But does
Taylor call it a day and go home to his wife and two
offspring, Douglas, 19 months, and Susan, three years?
No, it's time for another staff meeting which lasts late
into the night and often into the wee hours of the
morning. Did I just hear three PE majors say they
were going to run over to the psych department to
change their major?
Taylor's diligence has paid off, however. He has
the best head coaching record in the nation. Bar none.
He went 25 games without a defeat as head coach (of
frosh and varsity) until last week's blemish. Oflhand,
I can't think of a better percentage record in the
history of football. Even his rugby team went un
defeated in American competition.
Ked-thatchcd Chuck, who looks like a hip kid
who hist came off the farm, seldom reads a news
paper and at one time last year spent 20 out of 21
evenings talking at athletic and alumni functions
throughout the West Coast. Margaret, Chuck's
spouse, says she is used to being a football widow.
"I think it's just wonderful what lie's done," she
beams.
The one thing Chuck won't stand for is anyone
dogging it in practice. My favorite anecdote about
Chuck is the following: When he was frosh coach,
he noticed the first string guard dogging it in a scrim
mage. Taylor, an Ail-American guard himself one
time, got opposite the slacker at the line of scrimmage.
Without any pads or helmet he ripped into the hefty
guard on three successive plays. Each time, Chuck's
blocks knocked the guard fiat. After the guard had
recovered his winii he was the most ferocious player
in the scrimmage and went on to be a sore thumb
standout the next Saturday.
Thirty-one-year-old Chuck, the youngest head
coach in the nation, t/»ok ;i team that was rated "a
probable PCC weakling"' ;md facing a Herculean
schedule, came home with a champion.
Merry Christmas, Churk, may your two most
cherished presents be a Rose Howl victory and the
"Coach of The Year" award

On Mondays, he writes a "coach's letter," a corre
spondence which goes to nil the alumni groups giving
his account of the previous Saturday's game. This is
a new gimmick, invented by Taylor, and it is another
reason why his public relations are so good.
Tayior answers letters until 8:30 ;it which time be
has a staff meeting until 9:30. During that hour, the
coaches do nothing but. discuss personnel changes
and improvements suggested by the previous after
noon's workout. The period between 9:30 and 11:30
is spent running over and over game movies. From
II to 12. Taylor answers more mail, receives visitors,
confers with players, and takes care of much of the
non-technicnl aspects of kickball.
12 p.m. to l.:i(l p.m. are spent fating a hearty meal
and meeting and talking with the various big wheels
in the newspaper, magazine, alumni, and business
world. Its staff meeting time again for the next two
hours, as the mentor.' plot ever\ minute of that
afternoons practice. To paraphrase an automobile
ad, minute for minute, you can't heat a Taylor prac
tice session.

After that, it's the actual practice. Dutch Fehring
takes the defensive linemen, Joe Ruetz the offensive
up-front-men, George Lynn the backfield defenders,
and Pete Kmetovic the offensive backfield. Taylor
supervises the whole affair and divides his time be
tween the various groups.
At U:45 the coaches break bread with the players
nt the training table. By this time, any normal man
would be decked out in his favorite armchair, a pipe
in his hand, and a purring cat on his lap. But does
Taylor call it a day and go home to his wife and two
offspring, Douglas, 19 months, and Susan, three years?
No, it's time for another staff meeting which lasts late
into the night and often into the wee hours of the
morning. Did I just hear three PE majors say they
were going to run over to the psych department to
change their major?
Taylor's diligence has paid off, however. He has
the best head coaching record in the nation. Bar none.
He went 25 games without a defeat as head coach (of
frosh and varsity) until last week's blemish. Oflhand,
I can't think of a better percentage record in the
history of football. Even his rugby team went un
defeated in American competition.
Ked-thatchcd Chuck, who looks like a hip kid
who hist came off the farm, seldom reads a news
paper and at one time last year spent 20 out of 21
evenings talking at athletic and alumni functions
throughout the West Coast. Margaret, Chuck's
spouse, says she is used to being a football widow.
"I think it's just wonderful what lie's done," she
beams.
The one thing Chuck won't stand for is anyone
dogging it in practice. My favorite anecdote about
Chuck is the following: When he was frosh coach,
he noticed the first string guard dogging it in a scrim
mage. Taylor, an Ail-American guard himself one
time, got opposite the slacker at the line of scrimmage.
Without any pads or helmet he ripped into the hefty
guard on three successive plays. Each time, Chuck's
blocks knocked the guard fiat. After the guard had
recovered his winii he was the most ferocious player
in the scrimmage and went on to be a sore thumb
standout the next Saturday.
Thirty-one-year-old Chuck, the youngest head
coach in the nation, t/»ok ;i team that was rated "a
probable PCC weakling"' ;md facing a Herculean
schedule, came home with a champion.
Merry Christmas, Churk, may your two most

TAYLOR FOR COACH OF THE YEAR

I can't think of a more appropriate way of polish
ing off the last column this quarter than by wishing
you a Merry Christmas and by giving Chuck Taylor
a push for ''Coach of the Year" honors.
Don Liebcndorfer, athletic news publicist. told me
yesterday, "If Chuck isn't coach of the year, I can't
imagine who would he. As long as I've been at Stan
ford (Liebendorfer has been here since 1!I20) I can't
remember a finer coaching iob than that turned in
by Taylor and his staff."
In case you think the only thing a coach does is
diagram plays and turn out for practice five days a
week, you might be interested in Taylor's schedule
during football season. He keeps hours reminiscent

of the English coal miners in pre-
Industrial Revolution times. None
of this 40 hour a week stuff for
Taylor. He works 65 hours if he
works a minute. Hear his sched
ule:
He sets his alarm for 7 a.m., has
a breakfast of coffee and orange
juice, and is at the office by 8 a.m.
He used to eat more before the
rigors ot a head coaching job de
scended on him. On Mondays and

up-front-men, George Lynn the backfield defenders,
and Pete Kmetovic the offensive backfield. Taylor
supervises the whole affair and divides his time be
tween the various groups.
At U:45 the coaches break bread with the players
nt the training table. By this time, any normal man
would be decked out in his favorite armchair, a pipe
in his hand, and a purring cat on his lap. But does
Taylor call it a day and go home to his wife and two
offspring, Douglas, 19 months, and Susan, three years?
No, it's time for another staff meeting which lasts late
into the night and often into the wee hours of the
morning. Did I just hear three PE majors say they
were going to run over to the psych department to
change their major?
Taylor's diligence has paid off, however. He has
the best head coaching record in the nation. Bar none.
He went 25 games without a defeat as head coach (of
frosh and varsity) until last week's blemish. Oflhand,
I can't think of a better percentage record in the
history of football. Even his rugby team went un
defeated in American competition.
Ked-thatchcd Chuck, who looks like a hip kid
who hist came off the farm, seldom reads a news
paper and at one time last year spent 20 out of 21
evenings talking at athletic and alumni functions
throughout the West Coast. Margaret, Chuck's
spouse, says she is used to being a football widow.
"I think it's just wonderful what lie's done," she
beams.
The one thing Chuck won't stand for is anyone
dogging it in practice. My favorite anecdote about
Chuck is the following: When he was frosh coach,
he noticed the first string guard dogging it in a scrim
mage. Taylor, an Ail-American guard himself one
time, got opposite the slacker at the line of scrimmage.
Without any pads or helmet he ripped into the hefty
guard on three successive plays. Each time, Chuck's
blocks knocked the guard fiat. After the guard had
recovered his winii he was the most ferocious player
in the scrimmage and went on to be a sore thumb
standout the next Saturday.
Thirty-one-year-old Chuck, the youngest head
coach in the nation, t/»ok ;i team that was rated "a
probable PCC weakling"' ;md facing a Herculean
schedule, came home with a champion.
Merry Christmas, Churk, may your two most
cherished presents be a Rose Howl victory and the
"Coach of The Year" award

TAYLOR FOR COACH OF THE YEAR

I can't think of a more appropriate way of polish
ing off the last column this quarter than by wishing
you a Merry Christmas and by giving Chuck Taylor
a push for ''Coach of the Year" honors.
Don Liebcndorfer, athletic news publicist. told me
yesterday, "If Chuck isn't coach of the year, I can't
imagine who would he. As long as I've been at Stan
ford (Liebendorfer has been here since 1!I20) I can't
remember a finer coaching iob than that turned in
by Taylor and his staff."
In case you think the only thing a coach does is
diagram plays and turn out for practice five days a
week, you might be interested in Taylor's schedule
during football season. He keeps hours reminiscent

of the English coal miners in pre-
Industrial Revolution times. None
of this 40 hour a week stuff for
Taylor. He works 65 hours if he
works a minute. Hear his sched
ule:
He sets his alarm for 7 a.m., has
a breakfast of coffee and orange
juice, and is at the office by 8 a.m.
He used to eat more before the
rigors ot a head coaching job de
scended on him. On Mondays and

sometimes on other days he is in his office by 7 a.m.
On Mondays, he writes a "coach's letter," a corre
spondence which goes to nil the alumni groups giving
his account of the previous Saturday's game. This is
a new gimmick, invented by Taylor, and it is another
reason why his public relations are so good.
Tayior answers letters until 8:30 ;it which time be
has a staff meeting until 9:30. During that hour, the
coaches do nothing but. discuss personnel changes
and improvements suggested by the previous after
noon's workout. The period between 9:30 and 11:30
is spent running over and over game movies. From
II to 12. Taylor answers more mail, receives visitors,
confers with players, and takes care of much of the
non-technicnl aspects of kickball.
12 p.m. to l.:i(l p.m. are spent fating a hearty meal
and meeting and talking with the various big wheels
in the newspaper, magazine, alumni, and business
world. Its staff meeting time again for the next two
hours, as the mentor.' plot ever\ minute of that
afternoons practice. To paraphrase an automobile
ad, minute for minute, you can't heat a Taylor prac
tice session.
