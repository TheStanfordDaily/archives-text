# Bob Mathias Makes 'Life'
## 
### 
Stanford's Bob Mathias is com
pared to Jim Thorpe, former Car
lisle football great and track star,
who is sometimes called the greatest
all-around athlete of them all, in
the Dec. 3 issue of Life magazine,
due on newsstands today.
The two-page spread pictures the
two athletes in similar poses and
lists their best marks for the de
cathlon events. Mathias holds the
edge on five, Thorpe on four, and
one is even.
The article points out Mathias
hasn't participated in the range of
sports Thorpe has. Besides his foot
ball and track feats, "Thorpe was
also a big league baseball player, a
rugged wrestler, a good basketball
and tennis player, a fine marksman
with gun or bow and arrow."
Life quotes Thorpe as saying:
"Mathias hasn't had a chance to
play as many sports as I did, but
even if he had he probably wouldn't
be as good as me."
