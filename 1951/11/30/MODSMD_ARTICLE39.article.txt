# Point Plan Pays: Students Eating Better Breakfast
## 
### 
People eating at the Cellar, are
I eating bette>- breakfasts. So says a j
j survey conducted by the nutrition ;
I group of Dr. Henry L. Fricker's Hy-'j
j giene 50 class.
To make this survey, the group de
viled a ton-point breakfast plan,
j Each item usually eaten for break- 1
i last was given a point value. Either j
l two points for cereal, and the
I like, or nothing for tea or coffee. An
, excellent start for the day is reached
j when you eat the equivalent of ten-
I points. a |
j To make it easier to follow the plan, j
j the group made signs and put them j
' up in the Cellar. Before the !
were put up, the average breakfast
1 was 3.9 points out of ten. This week,
i nearly a month after the signs were I
installed, the average breakfast is '
slightly above 4.5.
Tomorrow the group will present i
I its findings to the entire class, and
I hopes to impress upon them that ed- >
! ucation is the best way tr> improve ,
I your diet. They will also point out '
j that eating a better breakfast will
j help your grades, as your mental as
| well as physical efficiency is in
icreased.
