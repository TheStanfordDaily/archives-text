# Sports The Stanford Daily
## DICK KLEIN The 						Sporting Line 
### 
Guess it's about time to wrap up the most successful football season that
Stanford has enjoyed since before the war. Bill and Gary continue to earn
much deserved honors. But how about the fine offensive line work of Norm
Manoogian and the great defensive efforts of Dick Horn going almost un
recognized by the national "experts."
As the Indians prep for the Rose Bowl, one thing should be kept in mind.
The Big Ten representative can be had and that's for sure. In the past, ever
since the PCC-Big Ten pact, Coast reps in the New Year's Day classics have
rolled over and played dead. But examine the intersectionals for the past
year. Three wins for each conference. However, Illinois made the best
record with wins over UCLA and Washington. But the Cards took care of
the Bruins and Huskies, too.
There's just one thing to do. THAT'S BEAT THE ILLINI, and do it grand
style. Let's not be such polite hosts, and get rid of the idea that mid-Western
schools have a free ride each New Year to knock the devil out of a PCC foe.
Think the Athletic Department deserves a vote of thanks from the
students. By now a lot of you have sweated through the line to get rooter's
tickets to the Pasadena game. It was about an hour-and-a-half wait.
There could have been another wait in store for all rooters iust a few
days before the game, if the directors of the Athletic Dept. had gone through
with the envelope plan of ticket purchase.
They've gone out on the limb and placed a trust in us. We have our
tickets now. Let's not take and do some mass scalping that can
really louse up the rooting section on New Year's day. Nothing could be
worse than trying to explain how to flip cards to an elderly couple on the
day after a terrifying night before.
The whole ticket problem is a difficult one for Director A 1 Masters.
Actual allotments are set by the Tournament of Roses Committee which
runs the whole Rose Bowl show and the parade, etc. So, at best, Stanford
only has a say over whatever ducats they are given to distribute. The prob
lem should not be too acute as we get more tickets to dish out now than
there are to pass around at Big Game time.

With basketball season opening up full blast this weekend, it will be
interesting to see what a lineup consisting of footballers Bill McColl, Bob
Mathias, and Harry Hugasian could do. That's no fantasy either. All can
handle themselves with great skill on the hardwood.
Imagine the opponents when a starting five that averaged over 200 pounds
took to the court and prepared to jam it up under the buckets. Would cer
tainly be an interesting show.
As everybody knows, Bill McColl has been wearing that big No. 3 jersey
on the gridiron for four years of top-notch collegiate ball. What lots don't
know is that Bill was a standout in other sports while in high school. In
fact, many say that lie was a much better baseball and basketball prospect
than football.
On the diamond, he was a great batter, a fast-ball pitcher, and spent part
of the time out in the outer garden as an unerring fielder. It was on the
hardwood where he really shown brightly and earned all-CIF (high school's
top honor) for a couple of years. In one Southern California tournament
at Beverly Hills high, McColl sparked his San Diego outfit to honors with
a straight-in shot that worked with a quick flick of his wrist.
Came time for college, and everybody was rushing the San Diego prep
star, but only for football. His outstanding grades won Bill a scholarship
to Stanford, and it was here he decided to play football. Ever since his first
year. Varsity coaches have been urging him to come out and try some other
sport. But Bill has only found time for the gridiron and a little rugby to
keep in shape.
At the beginning of this year, after a long talk with the new casaba mentor
Bob Burnett, McColl agreed to come out for basketball. Then, as the
season progressed and the Indian eleven began to gain mention for a post
season game, and McColl was a cinch for at least some game on New Year's
Day, the original plan was abandoned.
It was agreed that by January 1, the basketball season would be too far
along, and that Bill would not have time to get in shape and be of any value.
But I think that if he can spare the time from his studies (he's a first-year
medman), he could be of real help when the Indians tie-in to Southern Di
vision foes. McColl should be encouraged, if not urged, to turn out and see
what he can do with the basketball.
As for versatile Bob Mathias, the Tulare Flash has not had much ex
perience in melon-tossing. But listen to Coach Burnett sing about his
natural abilities, and you'd bet that Mathias could be turned into a top
notch haskcthaller.
His doings in track and football arc legend. But the possibility of Bob
learning something new in athletics brings up a little story. One time after
track practice in the Spring, he saw some guys playing horseshoes near
the gym. He had never tried it before, grew interested, and a few weeks
later tossed his way to the All-Univea-sity mural title in horseshoes. Not
bad for a beginner.
As for Harry the Hipster, he played Varsity basketball as a soph. Plenty
of speed and a good dribbler, Harry was doing fine and showed lots of
promise. He didn't go out last year, but certainly would be an asset to the
club. He's tough and has plenty of hustle.
That should be enough to point out that a basketball roster which in
cluded McColl, Mathias, and Hugasian is a definite possibility. It cer
tainly would be an interesting team to watch.

notch haskcthaller.
His doings in track and football arc legend. But the possibility of Bob
learning something new in athletics brings up a little story. One time after
track practice in the Spring, he saw some guys playing horseshoes near
the gym. He had never tried it before, grew interested, and a few weeks
later tossed his way to the All-Univea-sity mural title in horseshoes. Not
bad for a beginner.
As for Harry the Hipster, he played Varsity basketball as a soph. Plenty
of speed and a good dribbler, Harry was doing fine and showed lots of
promise. He didn't go out last year, but certainly would be an asset to the
club. He's tough and has plenty of hustle.
That should be enough to point out that a basketball roster which in
cluded McColl, Mathias, and Hugasian is a definite possibility. It cer
tainly would be an interesting team to watch.
Guess it's about time to wrap up the most successful football season that
Stanford has enjoyed since before the war. Bill and Gary continue to earn
much deserved honors. But how about the fine offensive line work of Norm
Manoogian and the great defensive efforts of Dick Horn going almost un
recognized by the national "experts."
As the Indians prep for the Rose Bowl, one thing should be kept in mind.
The Big Ten representative can be had and that's for sure. In the past, ever
since the PCC-Big Ten pact, Coast reps in the New Year's Day classics have
rolled over and played dead. But examine the intersectionals for the past
year. Three wins for each conference. However, Illinois made the best
record with wins over UCLA and Washington. But the Cards took care of
the Bruins and Huskies, too.
There's just one thing to do. THAT'S BEAT THE ILLINI, and do it grand
style. Let's not be such polite hosts, and get rid of the idea that mid-Western
schools have a free ride each New Year to knock the devil out of a PCC foe.
Think the Athletic Department deserves a vote of thanks from the
students. By now a lot of you have sweated through the line to get rooter's
tickets to the Pasadena game. It was about an hour-and-a-half wait.
There could have been another wait in store for all rooters iust a few
days before the game, if the directors of the Athletic Dept. had gone through
with the envelope plan of ticket purchase.
They've gone out on the limb and placed a trust in us. We have our
tickets now. Let's not take and do some mass scalping that can
really louse up the rooting section on New Year's day. Nothing could be
worse than trying to explain how to flip cards to an elderly couple on the
day after a terrifying night before.
The whole ticket problem is a difficult one for Director A 1 Masters.
Actual allotments are set by the Tournament of Roses Committee which
runs the whole Rose Bowl show and the parade, etc. So, at best, Stanford
only has a say over whatever ducats they are given to distribute. The prob
lem should not be too acute as we get more tickets to dish out now than
there are to pass around at Big Game time.

With basketball season opening up full blast this weekend, it will be
interesting to see what a lineup consisting of footballers Bill McColl, Bob
Mathias, and Harry Hugasian could do. That's no fantasy either. All can
handle themselves with great skill on the hardwood.
Imagine the opponents when a starting five that averaged over 200 pounds
took to the court and prepared to jam it up under the buckets. Would cer
tainly be an interesting show.
As everybody knows, Bill McColl has been wearing that big No. 3 jersey
on the gridiron for four years of top-notch collegiate ball. What lots don't
know is that Bill was a standout in other sports while in high school. In
fact, many say that lie was a much better baseball and basketball prospect
than football.
On the diamond, he was a great batter, a fast-ball pitcher, and spent part
of the time out in the outer garden as an unerring fielder. It was on the
hardwood where he really shown brightly and earned all-CIF (high school's
top honor) for a couple of years. In one Southern California tournament
at Beverly Hills high, McColl sparked his San Diego outfit to honors with
a straight-in shot that worked with a quick flick of his wrist.
Came time for college, and everybody was rushing the San Diego prep
star, but only for football. His outstanding grades won Bill a scholarship
to Stanford, and it was here he decided to play football. Ever since his first
year. Varsity coaches have been urging him to come out and try some other
sport. But Bill has only found time for the gridiron and a little rugby to
keep in shape.
At the beginning of this year, after a long talk with the new casaba mentor
Bob Burnett, McColl agreed to come out for basketball. Then, as the
season progressed and the Indian eleven began to gain mention for a post
season game, and McColl was a cinch for at least some game on New Year's
Day, the original plan was abandoned.
It was agreed that by January 1, the basketball season would be too far
along, and that Bill would not have time to get in shape and be of any value.
But I think that if he can spare the time from his studies (he's a first-year
medman), he could be of real help when the Indians tie-in to Southern Di
vision foes. McColl should be encouraged, if not urged, to turn out and see
what he can do with the basketball.
As for versatile Bob Mathias, the Tulare Flash has not had much ex
perience in melon-tossing. But listen to Coach Burnett sing about his
natural abilities, and you'd bet that Mathias could be turned into a top
notch haskcthaller.

At the beginning of this year, after a long talk with the new casaba mentor
Bob Burnett, McColl agreed to come out for basketball. Then, as the
season progressed and the Indian eleven began to gain mention for a post
season game, and McColl was a cinch for at least some game on New Year's
Day, the original plan was abandoned.
It was agreed that by January 1, the basketball season would be too far
along, and that Bill would not have time to get in shape and be of any value.
But I think that if he can spare the time from his studies (he's a first-year
medman), he could be of real help when the Indians tie-in to Southern Di
vision foes. McColl should be encouraged, if not urged, to turn out and see
what he can do with the basketball.
As for versatile Bob Mathias, the Tulare Flash has not had much ex
perience in melon-tossing. But listen to Coach Burnett sing about his
natural abilities, and you'd bet that Mathias could be turned into a top
notch haskcthaller.
His doings in track and football arc legend. But the possibility of Bob
learning something new in athletics brings up a little story. One time after
track practice in the Spring, he saw some guys playing horseshoes near
the gym. He had never tried it before, grew interested, and a few weeks
later tossed his way to the All-Univea-sity mural title in horseshoes. Not
bad for a beginner.
As for Harry the Hipster, he played Varsity basketball as a soph. Plenty
of speed and a good dribbler, Harry was doing fine and showed lots of
promise. He didn't go out last year, but certainly would be an asset to the
club. He's tough and has plenty of hustle.
That should be enough to point out that a basketball roster which in
cluded McColl, Mathias, and Hugasian is a definite possibility. It cer
tainly would be an interesting team to watch.
Guess it's about time to wrap up the most successful football season that
Stanford has enjoyed since before the war. Bill and Gary continue to earn
much deserved honors. But how about the fine offensive line work of Norm
Manoogian and the great defensive efforts of Dick Horn going almost un
recognized by the national "experts."
As the Indians prep for the Rose Bowl, one thing should be kept in mind.
The Big Ten representative can be had and that's for sure. In the past, ever
since the PCC-Big Ten pact, Coast reps in the New Year's Day classics have
rolled over and played dead. But examine the intersectionals for the past
year. Three wins for each conference. However, Illinois made the best
record with wins over UCLA and Washington. But the Cards took care of
the Bruins and Huskies, too.
There's just one thing to do. THAT'S BEAT THE ILLINI, and do it grand
style. Let's not be such polite hosts, and get rid of the idea that mid-Western
schools have a free ride each New Year to knock the devil out of a PCC foe.
Think the Athletic Department deserves a vote of thanks from the
students. By now a lot of you have sweated through the line to get rooter's
tickets to the Pasadena game. It was about an hour-and-a-half wait.
There could have been another wait in store for all rooters iust a few
days before the game, if the directors of the Athletic Dept. had gone through
with the envelope plan of ticket purchase.
They've gone out on the limb and placed a trust in us. We have our
tickets now. Let's not take and do some mass scalping that can
really louse up the rooting section on New Year's day. Nothing could be
worse than trying to explain how to flip cards to an elderly couple on the
day after a terrifying night before.
The whole ticket problem is a difficult one for Director A 1 Masters.
Actual allotments are set by the Tournament of Roses Committee which
runs the whole Rose Bowl show and the parade, etc. So, at best, Stanford
only has a say over whatever ducats they are given to distribute. The prob
lem should not be too acute as we get more tickets to dish out now than
there are to pass around at Big Game time.

With basketball season opening up full blast this weekend, it will be
interesting to see what a lineup consisting of footballers Bill McColl, Bob
Mathias, and Harry Hugasian could do. That's no fantasy either. All can
handle themselves with great skill on the hardwood.
Imagine the opponents when a starting five that averaged over 200 pounds
took to the court and prepared to jam it up under the buckets. Would cer
tainly be an interesting show.
As everybody knows, Bill McColl has been wearing that big No. 3 jersey
on the gridiron for four years of top-notch collegiate ball. What lots don't
know is that Bill was a standout in other sports while in high school. In
fact, many say that lie was a much better baseball and basketball prospect
than football.
On the diamond, he was a great batter, a fast-ball pitcher, and spent part
of the time out in the outer garden as an unerring fielder. It was on the
hardwood where he really shown brightly and earned all-CIF (high school's
top honor) for a couple of years. In one Southern California tournament
at Beverly Hills high, McColl sparked his San Diego outfit to honors with
a straight-in shot that worked with a quick flick of his wrist.
Came time for college, and everybody was rushing the San Diego prep
star, but only for football. His outstanding grades won Bill a scholarship
to Stanford, and it was here he decided to play football. Ever since his first
year. Varsity coaches have been urging him to come out and try some other
sport. But Bill has only found time for the gridiron and a little rugby to
