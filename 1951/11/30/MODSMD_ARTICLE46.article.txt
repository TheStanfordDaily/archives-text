# Varsity Opens Season Here This Week-end
## 
### DICK KLEIN Daily Casaba Scribe 
The sports spotlight makes a quick shift from the big earthen Stadium
over to Stanford's cracker box Pavilion. The Stanford cagers tangle with
an unknown California Poly team with the first jump ball set for 8 p.m.
.The junior varsity opens fire at 6 p.m. against Fremont high school.
Tonight's debut of the Indian five is full of significance. It marks the first
appearance of a Bob Burnett-coached varsity team. It also should be a
good indicator of just how good the Cards will be in their attempt to get back
into the PCC Southern Division race.
After nearly two months of hard conditioning, Burnett has his starting
five just about set. Of course, Jim Ramstead, 6'5" veteran, will be pivoting
from the center post and attempting to control the backboards. Jim Walsh,
fire guard, and Ed Tucker, potential All-American forward, will be the other
solid starters and returnees from last year's so-so squad.
Off their great improvement in practice. Bill Stevenson, at forward, and
guard Paul Johnson move into the Indian's high-flying fast break. With
plenty of running featuring the attack, a lot of reserves are sure to see action.
Dave Epperson, Don Carlson, OUie SuzdalcfT, Fritz Fenster, all familiar
names to Farm casaba fans, and frosh newcomer Hon Tomsic are scheduled
for plenty of action. All are good in the fast break and, especially Tomsic,
Carlson, and SuzdalcfT, can break into the first five.

BEST-EVER FROSH —Card supporters are hoping that these
members of last year's best-ever Papoose team can turn into a
Card best-ever Varsity. First row: from 1 to r, Coach Burnett,
Don Carlson, Dave Epperson, Sam Morley, Second row, Hal
Ellis, Olie Suzdaleff, Don DeLong, Ray Swarts, Jack Gebert.
Cal Poly's attack centcrs around Ed Nichols, fi'2" forward, who averaged
nearly 12 points per game last year. Coach Ed Jorgenson's crew had a 22-K
record last year, and Nichols earned all-CCAA honors.
Other starters arc lettermen Jerry Fredericks, Bob Tomlinson, a 6'4"
guard who is a two year veteran and weighs 205 pounds, and Dave Ziemcr,
the other guard. Only newcomer to the Poly first string is 6'3" center Al
Sutton.
Tomorrow night the Varsity goes against a make-shift Alumni group
that will be coached h.v the old master Everett Dean. Highlight of the
evening will he the return of Stanford's old Birdman—George Yardley.
Now starring for the Stewart Chcvvics, coached by Ilank I.ussetti, Yardley
has even gained more honors when was selected the AAU Tourney's
standout player last year.
George will be surrounded by a host of famous hardwood names, such
as Dave Davidson, Ed Voss, Babe Higgins, Jack Dana, and Miltie Iverson.
Contnuing the hot opening pace, another double-header is set for Mon
day night. The Varsity plays a fair COP five and the Braves tip off wilh the
Pacific junior varsity.

Sutton.
Tomorrow night the Varsity goes against a make-shift Alumni group
that will be coached h.v the old master Everett Dean. Highlight of the
evening will he the return of Stanford's old Birdman—George Yardley.
Now starring for the Stewart Chcvvics, coached by Ilank I.ussetti, Yardley
has even gained more honors when was selected the AAU Tourney's
standout player last year.
George will be surrounded by a host of famous hardwood names, such
as Dave Davidson, Ed Voss, Babe Higgins, Jack Dana, and Miltie Iverson.
Contnuing the hot opening pace, another double-header is set for Mon
day night. The Varsity plays a fair COP five and the Braves tip off wilh the
Pacific junior varsity.

The sports spotlight makes a quick shift from the big earthen Stadium
over to Stanford's cracker box Pavilion. The Stanford cagers tangle with
an unknown California Poly team with the first jump ball set for 8 p.m.
.The junior varsity opens fire at 6 p.m. against Fremont high school.
Tonight's debut of the Indian five is full of significance. It marks the first
appearance of a Bob Burnett-coached varsity team. It also should be a
good indicator of just how good the Cards will be in their attempt to get back
into the PCC Southern Division race.
After nearly two months of hard conditioning, Burnett has his starting
five just about set. Of course, Jim Ramstead, 6'5" veteran, will be pivoting
from the center post and attempting to control the backboards. Jim Walsh,
fire guard, and Ed Tucker, potential All-American forward, will be the other
solid starters and returnees from last year's so-so squad.
Off their great improvement in practice. Bill Stevenson, at forward, and
guard Paul Johnson move into the Indian's high-flying fast break. With
plenty of running featuring the attack, a lot of reserves are sure to see action.
Dave Epperson, Don Carlson, OUie SuzdalcfT, Fritz Fenster, all familiar
names to Farm casaba fans, and frosh newcomer Hon Tomsic are scheduled
for plenty of action. All are good in the fast break and, especially Tomsic,
Carlson, and SuzdalcfT, can break into the first five.

BEST-EVER FROSH —Card supporters are hoping that these
members of last year's best-ever Papoose team can turn into a
Card best-ever Varsity. First row: from 1 to r, Coach Burnett,
Don Carlson, Dave Epperson, Sam Morley, Second row, Hal
Ellis, Olie Suzdaleff, Don DeLong, Ray Swarts, Jack Gebert.
Cal Poly's attack centcrs around Ed Nichols, fi'2" forward, who averaged
nearly 12 points per game last year. Coach Ed Jorgenson's crew had a 22-K
record last year, and Nichols earned all-CCAA honors.
Other starters arc lettermen Jerry Fredericks, Bob Tomlinson, a 6'4"
guard who is a two year veteran and weighs 205 pounds, and Dave Ziemcr,
the other guard. Only newcomer to the Poly first string is 6'3" center Al
Sutton.
