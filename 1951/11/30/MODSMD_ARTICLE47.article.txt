George H. Mayr started his
long and successful business
career at the bottom, but he had
two assets and he made the most
of ihem.
George Mayr was an American and
free to invest hk knowledge as he
thought best. And he had an un
common talent for investing it wisely.
Today he is a wealthy man, but he
is still making wise investments—in
human beings. Six of them are Stan
lord students.
Mayr Investment at Stanford
The Mayr scholarship winners now
at Stanford are: Don E. Glass, grad
uate student in law; Grove C. Nooney,
graduate student in mathematics, on
leave this quarter; James C. Mans
ficld, senior in economics; Fl;ith Fa
gan and Douglass Perry, both sopho
mores planning to major in educa
tion; and Albert Brouse, freshman
who will major in political science.
The youngest son of a $3-a-week
Hockl'ord, 111., cigar maker, Mayr was
denied the chance to go to college.
The education he always wanted be
yond his financial reach.
A Medicine that Worked
He worked and saved for years
Finally he accumulated enough capi
tal to buy a drug store at the corner
of Washington and LaSalle streets in
Chicago. Then he tried his hand at
something thousands of other drug
gists have tried with less success. He
compounded a stomach remedy that
did what the label on the bottle said
it would. The public bought it, -liked
it. continued to buy it.
When he was GO years* old. Mayr
moved to Beverly Hills, California,
and semi-retirement. But long be
fore then he had started loaning
money to youngsters who wanted to
go to college but couldn't quite meet
all of their expenses. Dozens of them
came to Mayr for assistance and he
gave it; for as good investments al
ways do, these came back paid in
full and with a special kind of interest
return; successful men and women.
The idea of increasing this kind of
investment return appealed to him
and Mayr drew up plans for a per
petual foundation to finance scholar

ships for deserving young Americans.
Permanent Aid Set Up
George and Elizabeth Mayr were
married late in life. They had no
children. At his wife's urging to put
the foundation into operation while
they could still see it in action, Mayr
set the organization's machinery to
work.
Last year the George H. Mayr
Foundation supplied assistance to 33
California college students. Grants
ranged from $100 to $G6O. Eventually
the foundation will benefit 200 to 300
students every year.
Some great scientist or humani
tarian may be among Mayr's bene
factors. The chances are that there
will be. But even if there were not,
his investment will pay dividends in
American citizenship — and the man
to thank for it will ask for nothing
more.
At 83, George Mayr spends much
of his time bowling on the Beverly
Hills green. Passersby can't distin

guish this alert, easy laughing old
gentleman from his companions. And
that's just the way he wants it.
