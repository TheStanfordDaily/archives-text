# Dead Week to Start This Sunday Midnight
## 
### 
Next week is Dead Week.
Dead Week, a tradition shared by |
few other schools, starts at midnight i
Sunday. During the six days be
fore finals no social functions are
allowed (groups holding social
functions will be fined), there is no
Sunday movie, The Daily does not
publish, and professors are not sup
posed to schedule exams.
The reason for Dead Week is to I
eliminate distractions so that stu
dents can prepare for finals.
