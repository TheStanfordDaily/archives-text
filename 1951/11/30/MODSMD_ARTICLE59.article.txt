# Rose Bowl is not New To Cards or Illini
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN Daily Sports Historian 
Revenue will bo the motive on New Year's L)iiy when Stanford's Indians
battle the Fighting Illini in the annual Rose Bowl game, the grand-daddy ol
post-season football.
Stanford will be out to avenge other recent PCC entrants who have
bowed to tile Big Ten for five straight years. Illinois contributed their bit
as they thoroughly trounced a strong UCLA team 45-14 in 1947. Stanford
has journeyed to the Rose Bowl 1 eight times. They have won three games,
lost four, and tied one.
Michigan, the pride of the Bi<r Ten, brought out a mighty outfit to play
Stanford in 1902, the first year of the Rose Bowl. It was hardly a game, as
Fielding Yost's greatest of the "Point-A-Minute" teams steamrollered over
the Indians 49-0. Willie Heston, Michigan's ISO-pound three year All-
American sparked the attack as he amassed 170 yards on 18 carries for an
Atl-time Rose Bowl individual rushing record. Neil Snow was also an
outstanding Wolverine hack as he scored five touchdowns and gained 107
yards on the ground.
The Indians had to wait 23 years until they again made their entrance
into the Rose Bowl, only to lose to Notre Dame, 27-10. It was Ernie Nevers,
Stanford's greatest footballer, playing on two broken ankles against the
fabulous Four Horsemen; Miller, Layden, Crowley, and Stuhldreher. The
Irish power proved too great, however, and Stanford had to settle for anothei
loss.
In 1 ( J27, an Indian team rated number one in the country was tied bj
Alabama, 7-7. With Dick Hyland and All-American Ted Shipkey starring
lor Stanford, the Cards rolled up 305 yards to Alabama's 98. The Crimsor
Tide held when it counted, however, and in three starts, the Indians wert
still winless in the Rose Bowl.
The picture changed the following year, as Stanford downed Pittsburgh
7-0. "(Jihhy" Welch, the Panthers' All-American hack was effectively
stopped and Indian hacks gained 203 yards on the ground. Seraphim Post
ami Walt Heinecke, Stanford's All-American linemen, were the defensive
heroes, and Stanford's fullback, BilT Hoffman was the outstanding hack
on the lield.
1934, the Vow Boys first trip to the Rose Bowl, saw Columbia, a four
touchdown underdog knock off the Indians 7-0 in the greatest upset in Rose
Bowl history. A naked reverse play called KF-79 with Al Barabas the ball
carrier, did the damage. A high spot in the game for Stanford was tht
modern Rose Bowl record of 152 yards gained rushing by the Cards' two
time All-American, Bobby Grayson.
Dixie-Howell to Don Hutson, one of the greatest college passing com
binations of all time, led AlabarnJi to a 29-13 victory over the Cards in 1935.
Howell completed 9 out of 12 passes for 100 yards, and ran for 79 yards
Hutson caught six out of the eight passes thrown to him .for IG4 yards. Foi
Stanford, Grayson, Horse Reynolds, Monk Moscrip, and Keith Topping
were the stars.
The 193 C game, the Vow Boys' final appearance, saw SMU go down in
defeat to the Cards, 7-0. It was strictly a defensive battle as Stanford
gained only 120 yards in total offense to the Mustangs' 14(5. Keith Topping,
Monk Moscrip. Horse Reynolds, and Wcs Midler all were Stanford's de
fensive heroes.
The Wow Boys arrived in 1940 and collected a 10-0 record and a 21-13
victory over Nebraska in the 1941 Rose Bowl. Frank Albert, Pete Kmetovic,
Hugh Gallarneau, and Norm St&ndlee comprised the backfield that brought
the T-Formation into vogue.
Illinois' only appearance in the Rose Bowl brought sorrow into the
hearts of Wset Coast fans as they downed a favored UCLA team, 45-14.
Buddy Young and Julie Rykovich ran wild and Perry Moss had an ex
ceptionally fine day at quarterback. UCLA's one bright spot in the game
was a 104-yard kickoff runback by Al Hoisch behind a key clip by Jerry
Shipkey. This was the first year of the PCC-Big Ten Rose Bowl pact.
