# Rooters' Hope Fades Fast
## 
### 
It was a gigantic letdown 011
a true rnovieland scale lor the
thousands ol Stanford rooters
who jammed the big grey bowl
with the red roses on the front
in Pasadena on New Year's Day.
Spirit was as high Tuesday as it was
low for Big Game, and through the
first half both skies and faces were
considerably brighter than they had
been last November. There was a
touch of comedy when a pair of dogs
ran from the far sidelines into the
Stanford huddle. One laughing rooter
commented ungramatically, "They
know which is the best team."
Dogs Make Mistake
But the dogs were wrong. A few
more plays and even the hard-boiled
realists who have been satisfied with
a one touchdown loss were stunned
and unhappy at the slaughter. Girls
turned from the field and buried their
heads 011 one another's shoulders as
the numbers scored on the "U of I"
side of the scoreboard.
But it was a philosophical group
oi rooters who filed from the stadium
after a somewhat mournful rendition
of the Hymn. Sprinkled among the
groans and sighs were comments like
"No joy in Mudville, huh?"
One More Weekend
Many of the thousands who tra
velled south are staying over the
weekend, but northbound traffic
Wednesday and yesterday was dotted
with Little Indians. Many of the
crowd also saw the Tournament of
Roses, in which pom-pom girls
danced before a flower covered "Beat
Illinois" card stunt on the Stanford
float.
