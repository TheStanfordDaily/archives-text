### PETE GROTHE 
Stanford's high flying basket- |
bailers enplaned early this
morning for the Southland, area
of a very recent Stanford trag
-1 edy. to try to do what their foot
balling brothers couldn't do . . .
win.
UCLA provides the opposition to
night and tomorrow night, and very
tough opposition it is, when one
considers that the Bruins are noth
ing but rugged on their home court,
j In recent years, the Indians have
had an unblemished record "112 un
biiccess on the Westwood hardwood.
Coach Johnny Wooden's defend
ing champs have won seven and

Jim Ramstcad. a six-foot-five
senior from San Francisco. vvas
elected by liis teammates captain
of the I!>r»1 -f»2 Stanford varsity.
Ramstcad plays center and leads
i ihe team in storing.

j lost tour this year, but have a six- [
won anrl none-lost record on their
home court. UCLA's losses wove all
j at the hands of outstanding oppo
sition — Kentucky, Illinois, and
i Washington (twice).
Among the Uclans' victims were !
the UCLA Alumni (f>2 to 45), Ari- j
j zona State (85 to 56), USF Cf>4 to ,
i55), West Texas State (G4 to 57), |

Dcnvri (flO t»i ,')K and '»') to 51), and
Bradley (H7 to tifi).
Wooden will start a team that
lacks experience hut one that is im
proving rapidly with each game. At
forwards are Don Bragg, a six
foot-five freshman find from San
Francisco, and Jerry Norman, a re
formed had boy who stands six feet
even.
Sophomore Mark Hibler opens at
center. Hibler is the skyscraper of
the squad, reaching six feet seven
inches into the stratosphere. Reli
senior, opens at one guard, and Ron

j able Don Johnson, a six-foot-three
| Livingston, a comparative mieget at
five-ten, is the other guard. Fresh
lacks experience but one that is
improving rapidly with each game.
At forwards are Don Bragg, a six
man hotshot Ron Banc is also slated
| for considerable action.
If the Indians are to hreak the
Westwood jinx, they couldn't find a
i better time to do it. They are riding
high on a record of 10 wins and one
loss, and many experts are saying
this is Stanford's year to take the
Southern Division PCC title. Oth

em think that it's a toss-up among
USC, UCLA, and ttie Indians, witb
Cal listed as a spoiler. Coach Bob
Burnett, on the eve of his first con
fetcnce game as head eoaeh, said,
"You can throw a blanket on UC-
I.A, Southern Cal, and us; it's that
close."
The pei.-.onahle Burnett has three
ot the outstanding men of bounce
in the league in Eddie Tucker, Jim
Ramstead, and Jim Walsh.% Ram
stead has chalked up 172 points in
'II games for an amazing 15.5 aver
