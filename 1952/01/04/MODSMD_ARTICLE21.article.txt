# Illinois Ground Attack Pounds Out 40-7 Victory Over Hapless Indians
## Six in Row For Big Ten 
### EARL ODELL 
Sports Editor, Stanford Daily
In case anyone's interested,
Stanford lost a football game the
other day, 40 to 7, to a gang of
boys from Illinois.
From a journalistic viewpoint the
game offered the most diversified col
lection of theories of Stanford's loss
since Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.
Some writers would have you believe
that Stanford never was, never is, and
never will be in the class of the Big
Ten champs. Others said the Illini's
superior conditioning for this game
proved the margin of victory.
If you perused the sport pages care
fully, you could find someone who
passed the game off as one of Stan
ford's bad days.
And then there are those who find
tiny rays of sunshine in every gray
cloud. These are the sportswriters
who said Stanford won half the game.
You can take your choice or you
can make up some new theories,
alibis or excuses, but kindly re
member that the final score was
slightly more than in favor of Illi
nois.
The game opened just as the
oddsmakers had predicted, with
Illinois chalking up six big ores the
first time they laid hands on the
ball. This took a little under four
minutes and six running plays.
Stanford fans should have known
right there that they weren't going
to stop the fast and shifty Illini
backs.
The Cards, however, still felt they
had it in them and almost convinced
everyone a few minutes later when
quarterback Gary Kerkorian opened
up with the famed Stanford passing
attack, and the Indians came roaring
back.
With some Ail-American passing
on the part of Kerkorian and superb
catching on the part of Harry Hugas
ian and Bill McColl, truly an Ail-
American in his play, Stanford came
right back at the Illini and scored
seven points to lead when Hugasian
piled over the center for the TD and
then held when Kerkorian added the
leader.
In the second quarter it appeared
to all intents and purposes to be a
tossup ball game, but another in
dication occurred on the last play
of the half when All-American
safety-man A 1 Brosky intercepted
a Kerkorian pass, and almost shook
loose for a touchdown as the gun
sounded.
It's too bad that the Cards couldn't
have packed up and gone home at
halftime, but unfortunately they
had to stick around for another half
a game. This was the half they lost
Two big "ifs" in the second half
might have changed the story some
what, but they were mighty big "ifs."
If Illinois defensive halfback Stan
Wallace hadn't intercepted Kerkor
ian s pass to Bill Storum at a point
late in the third quarter when many
thought Stanford was about to coo!
the game, and if the Cards hadn't
been penalized five yards afer Huga
ian had punched up a first down on
the way to a comeback early in the
fourth quarter — well, we can all
dream anyhow.
Those who were not avid Stanford
football fans probably wondered
why the score piled up so fantas
tically in the last few minutes of
the game. The Indians, who had
won more than one game with su
perior defensive play, appeared to
have holes throughout their defen
sive squad.
One answer might be that it was \
sacrifice on the part of Coach-Of -
The-Year Chuck Taylor who would
rather risk his reputation allowing a
huge score and let as many boys be
able to say in years hence that thry
had played in the Rose Bowl, an
honor, win, lose or draw.

The game opened just as the
oddsmakers had predicted, with
Illinois chalking up six big ores the
first time they laid hands on the
ball. This took a little under four
minutes and six running plays.
Stanford fans should have known
right there that they weren't going
to stop the fast and shifty Illini
backs.
The Cards, however, still felt they
had it in them and almost convinced
everyone a few minutes later when
quarterback Gary Kerkorian opened
up with the famed Stanford passing
attack, and the Indians came roaring
back.
With some Ail-American passing
on the part of Kerkorian and superb
catching on the part of Harry Hugas
ian and Bill McColl, truly an Ail-
American in his play, Stanford came
right back at the Illini and scored
seven points to lead when Hugasian
piled over the center for the TD and
then held when Kerkorian added the
leader.
In the second quarter it appeared
to all intents and purposes to be a
tossup ball game, but another in
dication occurred on the last play
of the half when All-American
safety-man A 1 Brosky intercepted
a Kerkorian pass, and almost shook
loose for a touchdown as the gun
sounded.
It's too bad that the Cards couldn't
have packed up and gone home at
halftime, but unfortunately they
had to stick around for another half
a game. This was the half they lost
Two big "ifs" in the second half
might have changed the story some
what, but they were mighty big "ifs."
If Illinois defensive halfback Stan
Wallace hadn't intercepted Kerkor

late in the third quarter when many
thought Stanford was about to coo!
the game, and if the Cards hadn't
been penalized five yards afer Huga
ian had punched up a first down on
the way to a comeback early in the
fourth quarter — well, we can all
dream anyhow.
Those who were not avid Stanford
football fans probably wondered
why the score piled up so fantas
tically in the last few minutes of
the game. The Indians, who had
won more than one game with su
perior defensive play, appeared to
have holes throughout their defen
sive squad.
One answer might be that it was \
sacrifice on the part of Coach-Of -

honor, win, lose or draw.

Stanford lost a football game the
other day, 40 to 7, to a gang of

From a journalistic viewpoint the
game offered the most diversified col

since Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.
Some writers would have you believe

superior conditioning for this game
proved the margin of victory.

tically in the last few minutes of
the game. The Indians, who had
won more than one game with su
perior defensive play, appeared to
have holes throughout their defen
sive squad.
One answer might be that it was \
sacrifice on the part of Coach-Of -
The-Year Chuck Taylor who would
rather risk his reputation allowing a
huge score and let as many boys be
able to say in years hence that thry
had played in the Rose Bowl, an
honor, win, lose or draw.

STANFORD TOUCHDOWN-^Harry Hugasian squirms over from two yards out to score the In
dians' lone marker against the Mini. The Hipster's helmet is visible over the left shoulder of
Illinois halfback Stan Wallace (40). The touchdown climaxed Stanford's one sustained drive of
the afternoon accomplished chiefly by Gary Kcrkorian's brilliant first quarter passing. Frank

age. Tucker is only a gnat's eyelash
behind with 109 points and a 15.3
average. The fireball Walsh has
chalked up 125 points for an 11.4
mark. This trio were all among the
first seven in PCC scoring last sea

Compare the Stanford averages
with UCLA's high man on the to

The Indians' other two starters
will he guard (Hie Su/dalelT and
forward Gary Andrews. Suzda
lefi is a quick - reactioned ball
hawk whom Burnett describes as
"excellent for a sophomore."
The Indians' major problem has
been to (ill the one forward spot,
Tucker being a sore-thumb stick
out at the other. Bill Stevenson,
who started Ihe season at forward,
supplied backboard strength but
didn't fit in with Stanford's fast
break. Hon Tornsic, frosh sensation,
has lolled up 109 points, but doesn't
have the height that the Indians
need at one of the forward posi
tions.
Andrews, after a slow start,
has shown the form that made
htm a starter in some of the
games last year, and may prove
valuable to any championship
plans that the Cards entertain.
Rapidly improving George Zani
novich, the pride of Delano, has
shown great jumping and driving
ability and will hack up Andrews,
Also look for action from center
Dave Epperson, guard - forward
Paul Johnson, and guards Fritz
Fenster, Bruce Iversen, and Tom
Green.
