# Time for Football Re-evaluation
## 
### 
(Editor's note. — These impressions by
Coach Chuck Taylor were printed in the
Stanford Review a few days alter the victory
oirSi USC in November, 't he remarks seem
appropriate now, especially after reading the
"blame it on Wilbur" accounts by many
sportswriters who forget that football is a
game, whether played m the bark alley or in
the Hose Bowl)
There are a few observations I would like to
make about our players, lor they have proved
themselves out ol the ordinary as far as Stan
ford football competitors are concerned. I have
yet to see a qroup ol boys willing to work as
hard and with such grim determination. 1 at
tribute the games we have v/on to that spirit
2nd that eagerness that are so important, not
only in football but in any endeavor they may
tackle in the future. . . .
I think possibly it is time to sit back and re
evaluate the game ol lootball. We should give
some serious thought to those boys who were
out there on the field before 96,000 people in
the Coliseum last Saturday. . . .
Think of them before the game, Friday night,
when the pressures were starting to mount.
The newspapers were building up the game
as a titanic battle. Each boy was being ana
lyzed on the ;:port:s pages.
Think ol them sitting around the hotel lobby

with their rninds far away, dwelling on the
game—how is he going to handle the man in
front of him, what happens i.f he can't block
him, what if he fumbles that ball, how is it pos
sible for him to stop boys like Gifford and
Carmichael?
Think ol these boys getting quieter and
quieter and more and more tense as the time
arrives lor the game.
Then think of them in the midst of the game.
Someone fumbles and hundreds ol alumni be
gin to criticize the boy who dropped the ball.
And think ol ail the grand playing that is going
on out there —all the wondeiful blocks, the
runs, the passes and defensive play -and yet
the second guessers are working full speed up
there in the stands.
These are the reasons why 1 think it would
be advisable for many of us, myself included,
to think ol the game in the light of the enjoy
ment the players get from it, and not whether
we win or lose. It is a great game and 1 think
you and 1 and all of the millions who see it
played every season should make it a point
of trying to preserve it as a contest to be en
joyed by the boys who play it.
1 mention this because against TJSC T saw the
Stanford football team at one ol its greatest
emotional pitches. I became concerned about
the tremendous pressures that are exerted on
boys who are actually just playing a game.
