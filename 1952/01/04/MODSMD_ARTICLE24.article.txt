### DICK McLEAN 
RESOLUTIONS FOR WINTER QUARTER
Now that 1951 is over, and fall quarter has ended,
and the distraction ol football season is through, and
the memory of all night cram-sessiono l->oo furloH. and

the hectic fun of Christmas vaca- j
iton is as old as a cold Tom and i
Jerry, and I just picked up my j
grades, 1 do solemnly resolve for !
winter quarter:
1) I resolve to attend all of my j
classes. No longer will I turn |
off the alarm clock to finish 112
an interesting dream. No long
er will 1 doze in a comfortable
pre-warined seat during lec
tures. No sir, I've got religion.

I'm going to sit up straight and awake and listen to
every word the professor says. What's more, I'm
even going to- take notes.
2) I resolve to plan my social life more carefully. I
don't care if \ go dateless all quarter; 110 more of
this standing in the lohb.v of the main library for
"just one cigarette." My motto for study at the
library will be "The Itoad To the Main Lobby Is
the Road To Academic Folly."
3) I resolve to watch my diet. No more "lunch" at
Rossotti's. Although this practice makes afternoon
classes much more enjoyable, it is not conducive to
good scholarship. The garlic bread will always
insure your getting a seat but the rest of the lunch
won't insure your hitting it.
4) 1 resolve to stay out of late at night discussions.
Even when the razzberry-jam-on-tlie-face bri
gades come trooping in at 1:35 and 2:35, 1 wont'
listen to wild stories or speculate with them or
console them. No siree, I've got religion. I've seen
the abysmal folly of my ways. I'm going to be a
new man.
5) i resolve to give up poker and blackjack and three

card Montie. No more cozy, friendly little after
noon games in front of the fireplace with a group of
buddies. Despite the convivial pleasure and all,
I just got my portable typewriter out of hock and
I'm not going back to writing these things out in
long hand.
6) I resolve not to go to the Cellar when I have an
hour between classes. The Cellar is the skid row
of the campus. There the lonely, lost, dejected,
thirsty, hungry, and forsaken souls congregate.
And like all places of its kind, one cup leads to
another and before you know it you've lost a
morning as easily as a weekend.
7) I resolve to read all the books on which I write
reports. No more of this quick thumbing routine.
I'm going to read the whole book, not ju.st the topic
sentences. (A good trick if you're in a jam for
time.) I'm not going to get another book report
back with the red scrawl " 'Roosevelt and Hopkins'
is not abuut Theodore Roosevelt." ( I thought that
Hopkins was Teddy's favorite horse so I wrote an
immortal saga of man's love for beast.) No dice
with the professor. Doesn't like horse stories.
8) I resolve to take my books when I go skiing. When
I pack my skiis, sun glasses, Ace Bandage, knee
brace, snow medicine, and poker chips, I'm going
to take my books along too. In case I break a leg
I'll have something to do in the hospital. I'orc
sightedness pays off, you know.
After careful thought and consideration I have listed
all theseâ€”my own resolutions for (lie coming quarter.
With these principles as my guide I'm sure to go plus
30. (Total for four years.) And I really mean to keep
them. Yes sir, I've seen the light. The academic spirit
is upon me.
But since this is just the beginning of the quarter
and there's lots of time to put these resolutions, into
action, I'll put them into effect tomorrow. Yes sir,
tomonow for sure.
