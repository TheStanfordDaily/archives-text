# Counseling Center Facilities Now Opened to Non-Students
## 
### 
The facilities of the Counseling and Testing Center at Stanford
were made available to non-student residents of Northern Cali
fornia Dec. 17.
John D. Black, director of the Center, explained the move by
stating that since the founding of the Center, many individuals

unconnected with Stanford had
made requests for vocational and
personal counseling. By Dec... 17,
Stanford authorities were in a posi
tion to meet some of the needs of
these people.
Clients from surrounding com
munities will be served primarily
during school vacations, between
quarters, and during the rummers.
Fees covering the cost of the serv
ices given to those over 14 will be
charged.
Center Beginnings
The history of the Counseling
Center began over a year ago when
it was established to provide Stan
ford students with the services of a
10-man staff specializing in voca
tional and educational guidance;
aptitude testing; counseling on per
sonal, emotional, and marital prob
lems; and remedial instruction in
reading and study skills. The Cen
ter also has a library containing in
formation on 3,!)00 different occupa
tions.
The Center's facilities were used
in the first year of operation to give
more than 0,200 tests to groups and
individuals. Last year alone, 2,!1i>5
hour - long counseling interviews
were held with HtJO students.
Kxtended Facilities
The extension of counseling and
testing facilities to the community
at large is in keeping with Stan
ford's policy of recognizing and tak
ing advantage of it; opportunities
for public service, already demon
strated by such agencies as the
Child Psychology Clinic, the Speech
and Hearing Clinic, the Legal Aid

Clinic, and the Stanford Rerearch
Institute.
Mr. Black emphasized the Cen
ter's desire to co-operate as closely
as possible with existing service fa
cilities like school counselors, youth
organizations, family agencies, and
individual professional workers, be
cause he feels that the co-ordina
tion will benefit the public at large.
The Center is located in Building
100 at the northeast corner of Inner
Quad.
