# Close Race Predicted In the PCC

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 3 (UP)â€”
The Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball campaign, both Northern
and Southern Divisions, begins to
morrow night amid indications that
tht' California half of the league will
enjoy one of the tightest races in
its history.
Stanford and California appear to
have what looks like the best op
portunity to break Los Angeles'
grip on the Southern Division since
IJJ4M, wht'ii the Golden Bears ol
Nibs Price made a runaway of the
race.
UCLA, under the tutelage of John
Wooden, has won the Southern Di
vision crown three years running,
with USC the runner-up on each
occasion.
California, sporting a (j-6 record
so far this season, has an advantage
in meeting USC at the Berkeley
gymnasium Friday and Saturday
nights. The UC court has always
been a jinx to the Trojans,
USC has won seven out of 12
games so far of an impressive
schedule studded with many lop
flight intersectional foes.
Stanford, with its 10-1 record the
best of the four teams, meets UCLA
at Westwood in a two-game series.
The Indians are a slight favorite
over the Bruins, who have won
seven and lost four while playing a
much more difficult schedule.
Up north where the terrible
Washington Huskies hold sway,
two-game series will Ko played Fri
day and Saturday between UV/ and
Idaho and Washington State at Ore
gon State.
In contrast to the Southern Divi
sion, at this writing the Huskies ap
pear to be a shoe-in for the North
ern Division title. Washington,
ranked fifth nationally in the UP
poll, seems to have everything a
winning quintet needs for a long,
rugged campaign.
To make matters worse for Idaho,
a rugged aggregation itself, the
Vandals play their games on the
UW court. Basketball experts say
the home court is worth ten points
to the resident quintet, but it's
doubful that Washington will need
that extra bulge.
