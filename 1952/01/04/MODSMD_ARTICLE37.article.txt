# Card Netmen Fared Well in Practice Tilts
## Had Clean Slate Against Local Foes 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's Firehouse court squad
gave ample warning of their high
scoring antics to come in the Big
Seven tournament when they
racked up eight straight victories
in practice games played just prior
to and during -the Yuletide vaca
tion.
Veterans Ed Tucker, Jim Ram
stead, and Jim Walsh, together with
sensational freshman Ron Tomsic,
were the big names in the scoring
columns during the win streak, as
Bobby Burnett paraded his entire
15-rnan squad in almost every con
test.
The Indians notched their first
four victories during dead week by
pounding past Cal Poly, the Stan
ford Alumni, COP, and St. Mary's
with a minimum of difficulty. Tuck
er led the Card scoring in all but
the Gael battle, center Ramstead
copping honors in that one with a
23-point outburst.
Poly fell 82-07, the Alums suc
cumbed by 77-03, COP went down
to the tune of 80-70, and St. Mary's
—despite a fourth - quarter resur
gence fell short by 74-65.
Highlight of the Alumni battle
was a 33-point exhibition by George
Yardley. The blond bomber, Ail-
American last year with the Stew
art Chevvies, thus tied the Pavilion
record set by himself last winter.
In contests played during Christ
mas vacation, the Cards out-raced
San Francisco State 02-78, followed
up the following evening with an
almost identical 91-77 win over
YMI, edged USF 52-49, and then
romped over Loyola in their final
pre-tourney warrnup 74-57.
S.F. State sharpshooter Kevin
Duggan turned in the outstanding
individual performance of the eve
ning by contributing 28 points to
th# Staters' losing cause. Ram
stead was high for Stanford with
17, Tomsic potted 15, while Tucker
and Walsh netted 11 each.
The YMI point-fest was featured
by the Indians' 37 points in the first
quarter, a Pavilion record for one
period scoring. Tucker led with 20,
with Walsh contributing 10.
Both the 92 points against S.F.
State and the 91 against YMI ex
ceeded former Pavilion full - game
records.

Tucker returned to the fore in the
USF closie with 17 points, but the
ex-Compton marksman was forced
to take second place behind the 19-
point total of the Dons' much-bally
hooed sophomore whiz Frank Evan
gelho.
The Indians overcame a 30-28
half-time deficit to down Loyola,
1 uckers Hi-point second-half con
tribution featuring the Stanford
comeback. Tucker tallied a total of

Stanford's Firehouse court squad
gave ample warning of their high
scoring antics to come in the Big
Seven tournament when they
racked up eight straight victories
in practice games played just prior
to and during -the Yuletide vaca
tion.
Veterans Ed Tucker, Jim Ram
stead, and Jim Walsh, together with
sensational freshman Ron Tomsic,
were the big names in the scoring
columns during the win streak, as
Bobby Burnett paraded his entire
15-rnan squad in almost every con
test.
The Indians notched their first
four victories during dead week by
pounding past Cal Poly, the Stan
ford Alumni, COP, and St. Mary's
with a minimum of difficulty. Tuck
er led the Card scoring in all but
the Gael battle, center Ramstead
copping honors in that one with a
23-point outburst.
Poly fell 82-07, the Alums suc
cumbed by 77-03, COP went down
to the tune of 80-70, and St. Mary's
—despite a fourth - quarter resur
gence fell short by 74-65.
Highlight of the Alumni battle
was a 33-point exhibition by George
Yardley. The blond bomber, Ail-
American last year with the Stew
art Chevvies, thus tied the Pavilion
record set by himself last winter.
In contests played during Christ
mas vacation, the Cards out-raced
San Francisco State 02-78, followed
up the following evening with an
almost identical 91-77 win over
YMI, edged USF 52-49, and then
romped over Loyola in their final
pre-tourney warrnup 74-57.
S.F. State sharpshooter Kevin
Duggan turned in the outstanding
individual performance of the eve
ning by contributing 28 points to
th# Staters' losing cause. Ram
stead was high for Stanford with
17, Tomsic potted 15, while Tucker
and Walsh netted 11 each.
The YMI point-fest was featured
by the Indians' 37 points in the first
quarter, a Pavilion record for one
period scoring. Tucker led with 20,
with Walsh contributing 10.
Both the 92 points against S.F.
State and the 91 against YMI ex
ceeded former Pavilion full - game
records.

Tucker returned to the fore in the
USF closie with 17 points, but the
ex-Compton marksman was forced
to take second place behind the 19-
point total of the Dons' much-bally
hooed sophomore whiz Frank Evan
gelho.
