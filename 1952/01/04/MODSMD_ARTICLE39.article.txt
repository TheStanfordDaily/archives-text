# Gary Picks Up Yardage in Rose Bowl
## 
### 

INDIAN ON THE PROWL—Quarterback Gary Kerkorian. after finding all his potential receivers
covered, runs for good yardage in the Rose Bowl. Kerkorian was probably Stanford's outstanding
player and when he retired near the end of the third guarter with a couple oi cracked vertebrae,
Stanford's hopes for victory went with him. Illini Bob Weddell and Cliff Waldbeser futilely chase
Kerkorian while Norm Manoogian and Harry Hugasian move in to help Gary along.
