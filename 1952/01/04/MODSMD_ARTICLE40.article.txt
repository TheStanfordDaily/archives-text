# Post Mortemâ€”-Pass Interception Was Turning Point of Contest
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Coach Chuck Taylor was some
how his usual grinning self in the
dressing room after Tuesday's Rose
Bowl debacle, albeit considerably
more weary than usual from trying
to stem the Illini tide of four last
quarter TD's.
He was quick to give full credit
to the victors in their 40 to 7 mo
ment of triumph, saying, "They
.vere just too good for u.s; they fig
ured our defense in the second half
and then just ran us to death."
Armed with a week's reading of
Dick Hyland's articles in the L.A.
Times, the scribes assembled in the
Indian dressing room closed in on
Taylor with questions whether lack
of conditioning caused the Indians
to run out of gas in the third quar
ter.
But Chuck was quite definite in
replying to their queries on that
point: "Our hoys did not poop;
yes, the score should not have
been that had; hut a lot of the
breaks went against us. and some
of the new boys we used in the
second half made mistakes which

, hurt us." 1
The big break, of course, was
(and both Chuck and Illini mentor
; Ray Eliot as well as most of the
spectators concurred on this) Stan
Wallace's dramatic third - period
pass interception and 54-yard run
: back which set up the second Illi
nois score.
After that reversal, Taylor said
the Indian defense seemed to fol<
(but he emphasized "not physical
ly") and the Illini took full advan
j tage of the Card weaknesses
through the middle, off tackle, and
finally the pitchouts around end.
Impressed by all the Illini backs,
Taylor singled out half Johnny
Karras and said, "Karras surprised
me; I didn't think he was that
good."
And then he closed the interview
with a reiteration of his general
philosophy on post-season games:
"The idea of a contest between the
champion of the PCC and the
champion of the Big Ten is fine
but the Rose Bowl conies so lonj
after the close of the regular seasoi.
that it is strictly anti-climactic."

Over in (lit* Midwestern dress
ing room Flint was a gracious,
cautious winner, while his victo
rious team members gave the im
pression of being a gang of exu
berant hut poised collegians.
Il was not as (Imugh (hey bad
gotten keyed up for a really big
game and then bad been suc
cessful. but more as if it were
merely the final win, the cham
pionship. of a long tough string.
Eliot refused to single out any
me player, saying it was strictly a
"team victory."
"We moved our linebackers out
Adder to stop the Stanford hook
pass patterns, and we decided to
itay on the ground more to keep
ball control.
"We were surprised that Stan
ford was so open up the middle
because that's been our alley, so
we naturally took advantage of
it."
Eliot gave good praise to sev
eral Indians: "Kerkorian's a sweet
passer, and McColl's really a
devil; we thought we were in for
a rough afternoon after those first
siv passes completed.
