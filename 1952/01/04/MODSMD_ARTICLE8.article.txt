# A 						Phi 0 Book Exchange Will Begin Today
## 
### 
I'he Alpha Phi Omega non-profit
Student Book Exchange opens to
day to sell and also to receive used
books. Located in the southwest
cornei - of Temporary Building A,
the Exchange wil be open from 0
to 12 and 1 to 4.
The Exchange will be open at the
same hours tomorrow, Monday and
Tuesday.
Wayne Fuller, chairman of the
new service fraternity project, ex
plains the procedure as follows:
Exchange Procedure
Students bring in books they
want to sell, fill out a contract, pay
the 15-cent handling charge, and
take a receipt. A Phi O will then
attempt to sell the books, and on
specified dates the students can re
turn to pick up either the books or,
for those books which have been
sold, the money.
Fuller explained that the books
will be sold on the basis of their
condition and original price. For
books in good condition, the selling
price will be two-thirds of the orig
inal price; fair condition, one-half
the original price; and poor condi
tion, one-third that price.
Time Limit
The dates for picking up either
the unsold books or the money will
be Jan. 21. to 2(>. The final dale is
shown on the receipt each book
owner is given. If the student floes
not pick up either his book or his
money by the specified date, the
ownership goes to A Phi O for use
in financing service projects on
campus.
The Book Exchange opening this
quarter culminates two quarters of
planning and preparation by the
Stanford chapter of A Phi O. The
Exchange is modeled after a suc
cessful San Jose A Phi O project.
