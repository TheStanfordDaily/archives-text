today he has assurances that Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower would
accept the Republican presidential nomination and announced ho

primary March 11.
Lodge, manager of the Eisenhower-for-presidcnt movement,

told a news conference that Eisen
hower "personally assured me"
while serving as president of Co
lumbia University that he was a
Republican.
He added that the Allied supreme
commander in Europe has "assured
many people he would accept the
nomination."
The Massachusetts Republican
said tie was certain Eisenhower
would not repudiate the declaration
aud referred reporters to Eisen
hower's headquarters in Paris for
confirmation.
Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New
York, first GOP bigwig to plug Ei
senhower publicly for the Repub
lican nomination in 11)52, issued a
special statement. "As I have said
many times in the last year and a
half, I expect General Eisenhower
to be nominated as the Republican
candidate for President and elect
ed," he asserted.
One of the aims of Lodge's an
nouncement was to head off a
movement by Democrats to enter
Eisenhower in the New Hampshire
primary as their own candidate.
Lodge said Eisenhower will take
"whatever steps are necessary" to
prevent his name being entered in
the Democratic primary.
The Senator asserted repeatedly
that his statement "will not be re
pudiated" but "will be confirmed"

"Would you expect confirmation
in Paris that he is a Republican and
that he is in to the finish?" he was
asked.
"Yes, I would," he replied.
