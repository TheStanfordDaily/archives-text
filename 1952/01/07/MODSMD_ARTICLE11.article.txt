# Stanford Scientists Report on X-Ray Microscope
## 
### 
A progress report on the de
velopment of a new and promis
ing scientific tool the X-ray
microscope was made during
the holidays by lour Stanford
scientists.
Speaking before the American
Physical Society, which met at the
University of California, were How
ard H. Pattee Jr., 1.. M. Rieser Jr.,
Hussein M. A El-Sum, and Mars
den Blois, all doctoral candidates in
physics, who are working under Dr.
Paul H. Knkpatrick, Stanford pro
fesroi of physics, the inventor of
the microscope.
In their reports on the microscope
the physicists made the following
important points:
1. The primitive model which
was fir*-! announced in 1948 has
n«»w grown info a compound X
ray microscope which now uses
four mirrors instead of just two.
• bus Itelping to center the view
ing field,
2. The new model now can
a distinct image of objects as
small hs a hundred-thousandth *"112
an inch.
3. If is possible fn perfect an
even more sensitive instrument,
because few technical obstacles
have been encountered.
1. Since X-rays are already be
ing used fur studying small bio
lexical materials with file new
microscope. Ibis technique is ex
pected to extend into materials
thousands of times smaller.
The X - ray microscope differs
from optical microscopes because it

can show smaller particles, but it
cannot show particles as small as
those which can be seen by an elec
tron microscope. • Since, however,
the X-ray microscope operates in
helium, which chases out air, small

living specimens which the electron
microscope cannot see because it
operates in a vacuum arc now vis
ible.
Work on a special "soft" X-ray
tube with a lony wave-length is

now being rallied on by Stanford
research workers. This tube when
completed will be a considerable
improvement over the "hard" com
mercial tubes which must lie used
at present.


THREE STANFORD SCIENTISTS examine the latest model of an X-ray microscope, on which
Ihey delivered a progress report at Beikeley. 11. H. Pattee Jr., right, demonstrates In 1,. M Rioser
Jr., center, and Hussein M. A. El-Sum, how mirrors are adjusted in the X ray microscope.
