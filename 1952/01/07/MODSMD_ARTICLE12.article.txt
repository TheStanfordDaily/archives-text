# Eating Clubs Will Begin Two-Week Rushing Activities with Open Houses Tonight at 7:30
## Frosh to See Row Houses Tuesday Eve 
### 
Stanford's seven ealing clubs
will initiate a crowded two
weeks of rushing activities for
the Farm's freshmen tonight by
holding open house from 7:30
to 10 for all interested men.
Tomorrow evening from 7:15 to
9:15 the 24 fraternities on campus
will begin their phase of the rush
ing social activities by holding open
house on the entire Row. There will
be no fraternity open houses tonight
as erroneously reported in The
Daily last Friday.
A 1 Sieroty, Interclub Council
president, invites all freshmen to
turn out tonight to the various
clubrooms—El Campo, El Capitan,
El Cuadro, El Tigre, Los Arcos,
Breakers, and El Toro —where club
members will be ready to greet,
meet, and get acquainted with them.
Following tonight's open houses,
the eating club rushing program
will continue with a series of meals
to which rushees will be invited to
get to know the individual groups
better.
The fraternities on Upper How
will lie open Wednesday night, and
the Lower How Thursday night.
Then on Friday night all the eat
ing clubs will again hold open house
at the same time as the fraternities,
before continuing with their indi
vidual rushing activities.
In keeping with the informal
membership requirements of the
clubs, there is no formal pledging
procedure. A club may invite a
rushee to join at any time, and he
may do so merely by accepting the
bid.
Sieroty announced that slacks and
sport shirts or sweaters will be the
proper dress for the open houses,
while Quad clothes will be in order
for the rushing meals.
General information about the
various eating clubs, their organiza
tion, facilities, and role in Univer
sity life has been made available to
rushees through an Eating Club
Manual which has been distributed
to all the freshmen in Encina, Toy
on, and the Village.
In addition, however, Sieroty an
nounced that the eating clubs in all
will probably pledge about 100 new
members, indicating ample oppor
tunity to join.

ing clubs will again hold open house
at the same time as the fraternities,
before continuing with their indi
vidual rushing activities.
In keeping with the informal
membership requirements of the
clubs, there is no formal pledging
procedure. A club may invite a
rushee to join at any time, and he
may do so merely by accepting the
bid.
Sieroty announced that slacks and
sport shirts or sweaters will be the
proper dress for the open houses,
while Quad clothes will be in order
for the rushing meals.
General information about the
various eating clubs, their organiza
tion, facilities, and role in Univer
sity life has been made available to
rushees through an Eating Club
Manual which has been distributed
to all the freshmen in Encina, Toy
on, and the Village.
In addition, however, Sieroty an
nounced that the eating clubs in all
will probably pledge about 100 new
members, indicating ample oppor
tunity to join.
