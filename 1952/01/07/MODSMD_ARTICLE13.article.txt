# Indo-China Next?

### 
HONG KONG — Persistent—but
unconfirmed — reports circulating
here say that Communist China will
invade Indo-China as soon as an
armistice or a stalemate eliminates
the need for strong Red forces in
Korea.
Some Hone Kong newspapers say
that a force of 100,000 to 500,000 men
already is being assembled by the
Communists in Kwangsi province,
near the Indo-Chinese border.
Indo - China's rich "rice bowl"
would be a vastly more valuable
prize to the Chinese Reds than the
bleak mountains of Korea. Most
observers here believe, however,
that any attack on Indo-China must
await a settlement of the Korean
conflict.
