# JUST A SCRAP LEFT
## 
### 
Only remnants remain of the ap
paratus constructed on top of Hoo
ver Tower last quarter. Scraps of
the red streamers dangle on one
sitle of tlir top bump, and some of
the materials used to secure the
banner are still there, but the pole
and banner are gone. The question
of who engineered the Big Game
night prank iM still unanswered.
