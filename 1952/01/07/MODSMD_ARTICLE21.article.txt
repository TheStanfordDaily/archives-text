The October exam has been the
center of much controversy. Some
law school deans called the exam
"unfair" and "discriminatory." One
dean, who asked that, his name not
be used, said, "It was a dirty bar
exam, just as dishonest as it was
possible to make it, given in the
interests of a selfish clique."
Only 391 of the 1.040 would-be
lawyers who took the test passed
The successful percentage—37.s—
was the lowest since 1946.
Eugene Glenn, chairman of the
board of examiners, blamed the low
scores on the fact that "the quality
of applicants is not up to the im
mediate postwar standard."
Critics of the fall bar exam have
pointed out that the severity of the
tests is reducing, year by year, the
ratio of lawyers to the total popu
lation of California.
Since 1940 the population of the
state lias gone up about 55 pri
cent. The number of lawyers lias
increased from 12,634 to 14,745—
only 17 per cent.
Meanwhile, apparently satisfied
with the results, Stanford Law
School officials were keeping mum.
"No comment" was their reply to

troversy.
