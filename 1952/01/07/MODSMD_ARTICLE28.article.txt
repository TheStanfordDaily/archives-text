# Rushing De-emphasis Needed
## 
### 
Fraternity and eating club rushing, that an
nua! period of guick handshakes and "glad to
meetcha's," starts this week. Right now, we'd
like to go on record in favor of a de-emphasis.
Talk runs strong these days about football de
emphasis, but maybe tushing could use a httle
ol same.
Stanford has done a lot to help de-emphasize
rushing, 01 at least put it in a proper perspec
ti /e. Our system ol delayed rushing gives the
fieshman and transfer a chance to look over the
good; and bad points of fraternities and clubs.
Bui unfortunately, you can't de emphasize
completely—you can't knock out all the snob
bery;—from a system which is purely an,d
simply a selection process of human beings
by oiher human beings.

A respected campus figure who belongs lo
a hatemity lold us a lew days ago "Don't print
too much material on rushing. There are too
many lellows at Encina who won't get in."
True, ol course. You can't get away from the
fact thai there will be disappointed students,
though there are many openings. But to as
sume that students who can't pledge will be
disappointed if/ to assume these students will
be doomed to campus isolation. Which just
isnt' true at Stanford, where independents have
no trouble getting in the swing ol campus ac
tivities.
So our idea of de-emphasis would be to tell
potential rushes to apply a httle de-emphasis
of their own; don't get the idea that you'll be
left out if you don't join an organized group.
