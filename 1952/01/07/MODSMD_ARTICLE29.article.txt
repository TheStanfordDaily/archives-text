### PETE GROTHE 
My { name is Oswald Oak Tree. You know me, I'm
one of the oak trees in front of the main libe. And
over (here, that's Salomy Sapling. Salomy and I, well,
we're;entangled. "Pinned" I think you humans call it.
Olterr when the earth worms aren't looking, Salomy
and I' hold roots. Yes, and someday we plan to hear
the patter of little acorns.

I should like to tell you our
story,j so throw a few humans on
the fire and listen:
SalOmy and I, we used to lead
a happy existence. We used to re
lax at our spots in front of the
main libe and enjoy listening to
the law students argue cases and
the psych majors analyze people
who passed by. The psych majors
never realized we were analyzing
them. Every now and then . . .

heh, heh, I have to chuckle every time I think of this
. . . we used to carve our initials on passing humans.
Yes, we used to lead a carefree existence. We
enjoyed the nourishing rain in the winter, (he re
freshing coolness of spring, and the invigorating
warmth of sununer. And don't think we weren't
kept busy, what with providing housing for the birds
and having to grow new acorns for the squirrels and
leaves for ourselves.
However, one day, everything changed for Salomy
Sapling and I. There I was, sleeping like a log, when

suddenly I woke up to find two men from the biology
department standing beneath me.
"Look," said one, "that sapling over there just fits
our purpose. That wood will make a good specimen,
and besides we can use it for our fungi lab."
"Well bless my chlorophyl," said the second, "you're
right. And this oak tree over here, this will be good
forâ€”bzzz, bzzz, bzzz."
Then both of the men from the bio department
clapped their appendages and said they would return
the next day to chop us down.
The next day came, and I saw them faintly in the
inner quad. As they came closer, I noticed they had
axes and saws in their hands. Closer and closer they
came, with grim determination in their eyes. I
shivered in my timbers! My sap ran cold!! Still on
they came, their sharp axes glistening in the sun.
There was nothing Salomy and I could do; we
gripped each other's roots tightly. Then they swung
their axes AND CHOPPED US DOWN!!!!
* * *
I am now a bathroom door.
* * *
Yes, I am a bathroom door in one of the biology
professor's homes. But Salomy and I are still to
gether. They decided to make Salomy a laundry
box, and she is still right next to me.
There is only one trouble. Every time she opens
her mouth to talk to me, someone throws some dirty
clothes in her mouth.
