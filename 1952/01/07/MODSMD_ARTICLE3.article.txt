# U.S.-British Talks

### 
WASHINGTON British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill met to
day with American military chiefs
for a quick review of urgent de
fense problems hindering Western
plans to meet the threat of Commu
nist aggression.
Problems facing the Western
leaders'' in the defense field cover
rearmament production barriers,
assignment of key commands,
weapons, the Korean war, danger
signals of new Red action in South
east Asia, atomic energy and co
ordinated use of American-manned
atomic bomber bases located in
Britain.
Britain's worsening economic cri
sis stands high on his worries, it is
reported, and he realizes that his
country's future progress Ls tied to
American aid which only Congress
can extend.
For these reasons, Churchill is
expected to try to match the emo
tional appeal of his wartime address
to Congress that won the closest
American-British co-operation and
help.
