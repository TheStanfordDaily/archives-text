# Lavish 'Tales of Hoffman' Is Overdone Opera-Ballet
## 
### DICK McLEAN 
"Tales of Hoffmann," the op
era-ballet by Offenbach, as pre
sented in the London Film cur
renlly at Ihe Park Theater, is a
three-ring circus of color, song,
and dance witfi a calliope of
fantasy playing in the back
ground.
The color is technic and lavish
and well done. The songs are Of
fenbach's operatic arias translated
into English and often hard to un
derstand. The dancing is ballet and
as such exciting and original.
But the production taken as a
whole is overdone, overrich. There
is too much to try to see and hear
and comprehend all at once.
Singing Voices Dubbed
Offenbach wrote his lavish work
to be both danced and sung. Ob
viously the combination of an op
era star as well as ballet dancer is
ra.-e. To find a complete cast that
fit these requirements is impossible.
The medium of the motion picture
solves this problem by dubbing in
the singing voices to the dancing
of Moira Shearer, Leonide Massine,
Robert Helpmann, and many others
seen in "The Red Shoes."
As the story opens, Hoffman is at
the theater watching his latest love,
a dancer. She sends him a note but
it i.s intercepted by Lindorf, the
evil genius who is to be the instru
ment of Hoffmann's misery through
all his three tales. At the intermis
sion of the theater Hoffmann goes
to a students' tavern to join his
friends briefly. There his fellow
students prevail upon him and
linally he tells the tale of his three
loves.

His love is for a dancing doll,
a most extraordinary thing. Hoff
mann is duped by a pair of be
witched glasses that give the linai
touch of animation and beauty to
the mechanical toy. He falls in love
with this contrived a p p a r i t i on ,
called Olympia by her creator-fa
thers, Spalanzani and Coppelius.
He pursues and wins his beautiful
toy quite by accident. (He touches
the button which produces a "Yes,
yes" from the doll.) In the end
Olympia is destroyed by the jeal
ousy of Coppelius. Hoffmann sadly
realizes that his love is dead and
the object of it never lived.
The second tale is of his love for
Giulietta, a beautiful courtesan who
is mistress to Satan. At the com
mand of Dapertutto, her lover, she
seduces the soul of Hoffman and
captures it in a mirror. For her
sake Hoffmann fights a duel and
wins the key to her apartment. His
victory is empty for she has fled
with her master. Hoffmann discov
ers that he has been tricked and in
desperate auger hurls the key at the
mirror, breaking it and the spell
that has held him. With the shat
tei ing of the mirror Hoffmann re
gains his image and soul. But he
hac lost his loved one.
Third, Tale of Antonia
The third tale is of Hoffmann and
Antonia. She is a consumptive who
must not sing because the strain
will kill her a.sit has her mother.
Dr. Miracle, the evil physician who
has been responsible for her moth
er's death, hypnotizes Antonia and
she sings a duet with a vision of
her mother. This final duet soars in
a frantic fantasy to end with the
death of Antonia.
In the epilogue each of Hoff

mann's past loves reappear with
the man who has destroyed them.
Each man — Coppelius, Dapertutto,
and Dr. Miracle — raises his mask
to reveal Lindorf.
"Tales of Hoffmann" is an attempt
at a new art form—the literal film
ing of an opera-ballet. The scope
of such a venture seems to work
against it. There seems to be too
much art. The audience sees a bal
lerina against a surrealist set with
the powerful music of Offenbach in
the background and the hard-to
understand operatic English overall.
The audience does not have enough
eyes anil ears to absorb all that is
thrown at it and thus i.s confused.
Ilelpinann Outstanding
The acting and dancing of Rob
ert Helpmann (Lindorf) is out
standing. Robert Rounseville (Hoff
mann) sings better than he acts.
Moira Shearer turns in her usu
ally fine performance especially in
the first tale of the dancing doll.
Her part, unfortunately, is not long
enough.
It is difficult to compare "Tales
of Hoffmann" with "The Red
Shoes." They are different at
tempts. "The Red Shoes" was the
drama of people of the ballet and
as such a success. "Tales of Hoff
mann" is a broad step in the direc
tion of something new. It is hard
to know whether to criticize the
motion picture or the art form. But
for entertainment value "The Red
Shoes" was much more arresting.
For all its faults "Tales of Hoff
mann" is an adventure in theater.
It has many brilliant moments that
equal the best in "Red Shoes." Im
agination and unrestrained art are
given free reign in a vivid two and
a half hours of music, color, and
dance.
