SPECIAL FROM THE POST OFFICE LAKE: With swimming more
than in stylo (unless the weatherman comes through in the early hours of
tlie moi ning) because of the current bountiful offerings from the God of the
heavens, let's take a look at the season prospects of Coach Tom Haynie's
Varsity mermen.
The first meet for the swimmers, one of the Farms most powerful, yet
least publicized major sports, is still sufficiently distant to require a small
telescope to see, but already raves are in order for the potential results.
The three top events for the swimmers will be the NCAA championships
to be held at Princeton March 27, 28, and 29; the PCC Southern Division
Championships in June, and the Olympic trials shortly after.
In a word the Cards are "loaded." Haynie believes that the coming
season v/ill be the best he's ever had. He's lost only four men, from last
years team which swept the PCC and finished High in the NCAA meet.
The out tanrling additions to the team this season are a pair of sensational
freshman backstrokers. One is John Weiser, who boasts a best time of
C 0.2 second;- in the 100 yards back. Ahead of even him is a chap by the
name of Larry Heim, who set a new national interscholastic record in the
300 hack last season with a time of 59.8 seconds.
And. Haynie reports that both these men are even better at the longer
distance o! 200 yards which is also swum in intercollegiate meets.
Add these additions in 'he backstroke to a well-rounded team of veteran
stars such as Pete Cole, Bob Thompson, Bert Holiday, Bruce Putnam, Bob
Frojen, and Jim Gaughram, and you come up with a squad which poses
Ilaynie with only one big problem: that of shuffling his men so he gets the
best performances on give days.
Only in diving are the Cards at all weak, and even here Bill Glathe was
good enough last year to place htird in the PCC meet.
Three swimmers and two water polo players in addition to a feminine
star are likely to carry the name of Stanford to the Olympics in Helsinki
this rummer. Cole and Thompson, who swam to a PCC-record-breaking
2:10.2 dead heat for 220 yards last year, are rated spots in the 200 meters.
Ileim is almost a certainty to make the team in the backstroke, while
Frojen and Ex-Card star Harry Borchers should make the water polo team.
Eroehcrs and Frojen, incidently, were both named to the 1951 AAU All-
American water polo team.
In addition, Sharon Geary, Stanford sophomore, will probably anchor
the United States women's Olympic team in the 100 meters and the back
f.t roke.
But in the PCC championships a little politics and philosophy will come
into play. Last year the Cards tremendous depth carried them to an over
whelming win in the conference meet.
At this stage of this season, it looks as if Stanford will virtually annihilate
Cal, UCLA, and USC in the PCC meet. If it does so, the situation will not
he healthy. Continuing discouraging defeats can kill off the desire of other
schools to develop swimmers on the coast.
Then not only will colleges in the east and north have an easier time
drawing talent, but Stanford's national position will also deteriorate be
cause of lack of practice competition.
It is to he hoped therefore, that after the Cards sweep the PCC meet for
the second straight year, Haynies coastal coaching collegues will go to work
with a vengeance to rebuild their swimming powers.
For it would be a definite shame for college swimming to disintegrate
on the Pacific Coast, since with its tremendous environment the coast is
potentially one of the greatest swimming training and development centers
in the world.
