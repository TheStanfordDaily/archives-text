# Card Cagers Split UCLA Series; Will Meet California This Week
## 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford's racehorse cagers slowed to a trot Friday night, roared
back Saturday to nip a good UCLA five and earn a split in the tip
off series of the 1952 PCC cage season.
Stanford's standoff with the Bruins, coupled with the California-
USC weekend divide, throws the Conference, Southern Division,

into a deadlock following the initial |
round of play.
It was Ed Tucker, Indian for
ward, who gave the Cards the
Saturday win. With UCLA lead
ing 71-70 and two minutes to go,
Tucker stole a UCLA in-hound
pass and drihhlcd half the court
length to lay in the winning
bucket. Fouled in his effort, Ed
added the free throw, making the
score 73-71. The Bruins could not
retaliate.
The play came about when UC
LA. on a doubtful bit of strategy,
elected not to shoot a free throw,
but rather put the ball into play.
The incident followed a fast and fu
rious third period in which UCLA
chopped away at a 12-point half
time deficit to go ahead (>4-(j;i with
five minutes to go.
And those last five minutes were
nip and tuck all the way, with the
lead changing more often than a
woman's mind. The Indians re
gained ball control, following a
missed Bruin shot in the last min
ute, and .stalled out the clock with
Oleg SuzdalefT doing most of the
work.
The first half was strictly Stan
lord with Jim Ramstead meshing 13
points before being "rested" because
of four fouls. Jim returned in the
fourth quarter to pour through two
more points before picking up his
fifth foul.
For the most part the Bruins were
bottled up by a hustling Stanford
full court man to man press defense
and good backboard control. Jerry
Norman paced the Bruin comeback
with good floor play and sharp
shooting. Norman was high for the
evening with 18 points. All of Stan
ford's starters tallied in the double
figures with Tucker pacing the
quintet with IG.
The win marked the first Stan
ford win over UCLA at Westwood
in three years, and only the third
loss the Bruins have suffered in
their matchbox gym since John
Wooden took over the coaching
•reins two seasons hack.
Bob Burnett's debut in the PCC
was ruined Friday night when the
Uclans, three-time champs of the
Southern Division, started off in
business - like fashion and after
breaking an early four-all dead
lock ran Stanford into the hard
wood and built up an impressive 42-
23 half-time margin.
The Indians came back strongly
following the intermission with
Ramstead and Tucker leatling the
way. Midway through the fourth
period the Bruin lead had been cut
to seven points. But Wooden re
turned his regulars to the fray and
they soon regained a safe margin
by hitting six buckets to Stanford's
one. This was more than enough to
wrap up the 81-(i3 win.
Stanford had difficulty hitting
from out and could not penetrate
the tight Bruin defense which was
employed immediately after the
Indians crossed the center line.
Frosli Don Bragg, local hoy out
of (ialileo High in San Francisco,
was leading scorer with 17. Don
Johnson, UCLA guard, hit for 14.
For Stanford it was Ramstead
with 1(5, Tucker with 15, and Suz
dalefT with 10.
For the weekend Ramstead and ;
Tucker totaled 31 points apiece to J
put them right up there in Confer

ence scoring. Ron Tomsic, a fresh
man, together with SuzdalefT proved
that there is still a place in bas
ketball for the small man. Both
more than compensate for their lack
of size by their aggressive, always
hustling, good shooting type of ball.
The Cards, now with 11 wins
and two losses, go to work in
preparation for the coming series
with California, which surprised
Friday evening by whipping USC
(55-55 and dropping a light one
Saturday 44-43. The Hears invade
the Pavilion this coming Friday
and the Injuns travel to Berkeley
on Saturday. 11 will he the Tro
jans and Bruins mixing it up
down south.
