# Oh, to Be in California Again Is Illinois Wish

All was not milk and honey for
Illinois' Rose Bowl champs. After
trouncing the Indians in Pasadena
and having quite a time for the re
mainder of their stay in the south,
the gridders took off for home. But
tsk, tsk, in Chicago when they de
trained, the squad was greeted by
only a few admirers, but the .snow
and rain were there in all their
glory.
