# Lake Nearly Full; Will Open Soon to Students
## 
### 
The annual filling of Lake IÂ«igu
nita will be completed in a week
or so, promising Stanford .students
a spring packed with water sports.
The building and grounds depart
ment began filling the lake Dec. 5,
and plans a maximum of 13 feet of
water at the deepest part.
Lake Lagunita will be six inches
lower this year than in the past,
because of the weakness of the
banks near the Roble and Lagunita
dorms. While this year there is
plenty of water, there have been
years in the past when the lake

has failed to fill because of lack of
l water.
To date there is approximately 94
; million gallons in the lake, which
J brings it up to 12 feet. The main
| and only controllable supply of wa
j ter comes from San Francisquito
Creek, which takes away the Sears
i vill Lake overflow.
Stanford has a dam on the creek
I with a flume which leads to Lagu
j nita. Only a small part of the water
is needed to fill the lake and the
l rest flows to the bay.
