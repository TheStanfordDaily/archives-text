A RESOLUTION OI THE EXECUTIVE COMMIT
TEE OF THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF STAN
FORD UNIVERSITY—NOVEMBER 28, 1951
WHEREAS, the purpose of criminal legislation is the
restraint of action;: detrimental to the public wel
fare, and
WHEREAS, criminal legislation must be enforceable
and consistently enforced, and
WHEREAS, we believe that the present liquor law of
the State of California fosters hypocrisy and con
tempt rather than respect for the law,
BE IT RESOLVED, THAT THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA
1, Set the minimum legal age for the purchase of
beers, ales, and wines containing less than 11% al
cohol by volume at eighteen years and
2. Provide persons between the ages of eighteen
and twenty-one years with non-transferable per
• onal identification which includes a picture of the
holder.
This resolution is presented by the Executive Com
mittee of the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity in the belief that the present liquor law in
California is unrealistic, and that it is not sound legis
lation because it is unenforceable and consistently
violated.
We are perhaps more aware of this situation than
most citizens because we are closer to the problem. We
are doing our best to see that tbe law is observed, and
will continue to do so; but we believe theie could he
a better law.

We urge that the purchase of beers, ales, and wines
containing less than 13 per cent alcohol by volume be
made legal for 18-year-olds, becaues litis is Ibe age
at which good judgment is expected in other phases
of living.
II is the age, for example, at which young men are
eligible for military service. At this age a man may
idairy wilh his parents* consent and a woman may
marry even without this consent. If lie earns more
than $500 a year he is not a dependent in the eyes
of the law. The state and federal governments as
well as most communities consider an eigliteen-year
old an adult who should assume responsibility. Vet
the privileges of adulthood (tie withheld.
Other states, Illinois, New York, Georgia, and North
Dakota in particular, permit the purchase ol alcoholic
beverages by eighteen-year-olds. There is adequate
precedent for adoption of such a lav/ in California.
As the law exists in California, a parent is forbidden
to serve alcoholic beverages to his minor children even
in his own home. Young married couples under
twenty-one may not drink or serve alcoholic beverages
in their homes.
We feel also that good legislation is that which the
citizens themselves help to enforce. If the privilege of
identification cards for beverage purchase under a
reasonable law is granted to young people from 18
to 21, we believe that they will protect that privilege
in every way they can. This would include careful
observance of the law, and efforts to prevent the sort
of traffic in falsified identification that now exists.
The lure of the forbidden is a strong one. It. leads
to excesses. The individual who is fiee from unrealistic
restraints is better able to exercise mature judgment,
and is more aware of his responsibility for his own
actions.
We believe this resolution is a realistic approach
lo a very real problem created by an artificial law.
The present statute does not help to develop among
California youth a respect for law or mature judg
ment. We urge most strongly your serious con
sideration of the changes we propose.
