# BULL SESSION

### DICK McLEAN 
THE STANFORD FRATERNITY
Tonight marks the first round of open houses for
rushing. Undoubtedly there are many questions hang
ing on the minds of freshmen concerning the Greek
letter residences up the row. Questions such as "Should
I join a fraternity? Which are the best houses? How
is the best way to get into one?" and many others.
But before I begin this series of Bull Sessions on
fraternities and rushing, I must give my own personal
bias. I am a fraternity man, have been on for several
years, and am essentially pleased with the system.
Despite this bias I shall try my best to give an accurate,
unprejudiced picture of Stanford fraternity and ha
ternity rushing.

First, Stanford fraternities are
different. They are looser, more
casual, and more in perspective
than most Greek letter systems.
The reasons for this uniqueness
are three: defeired rushing, the
requirement that freshmen live" 1
together for a year, and the ab
sence of sororities.
Deferred rushing means that
new freshmen get used to being
Stantordites before they make
ni.„ c..„i >

other affuhations. The first quarter of college is an
undisturbed and universal experience. Even after
deriding to pledge or not the freshmen live for the
remainder of the year together. In short, the first
loyalty is the university and not the fraternity.
Without the sororities the closed social circle (often
a snobbish one) between the Greek letter men and
v/cmen is nonexistent. Happily the phrase ''You're
in with Pan-Hellenic or you're .socially out ol it is
not true at Stanford.
Understanding these facts, you can see that Stanford
fraternities are not as strong as fraternity systems on
other campuses. Stanford Greek letter societies are
not as secretive 01 close knit or a.s lightly disciplined.
But the advantages of this Stanford way is that there
is little of the snobbery, interfraternity strife, fra
ternity-nonfraternity antagonism, and the question of
first loyalties that plagues other schools. It is my belief
that fraternity of the Stanford brand is fraternity
within its proper proportions.
A good derision to reach pretty early is whether
cr not you really want to join a house. Pledging
•imply because it is the thing to do is poor logic.
Fraternities are tor those who enjoy themselves best

when acting in a group. The obvious advantages of
fraternities are (he group aspects such as house par
ties, singing, exchanges. The disadvantages are the
demands made on time and energy and (lie restric
tion of individualism.
Some of the specific advantages of fraternities are:
1) Some feeling of social prestige in gaining mem
bership in a small group for those that desire a smaller
group.
2) Good parties if you have fun in larger groups
rather than in smaller ones.
3) Better food.
4) An opportunity to know a larger group-.well.
f<) Companionship.
0) A lever for business contacts in later life.
7) A discipline that is designed to stimulate group
effort.
Some of the specific disadvantages of fraternities
are:
1) The time demanded of fraternity men by their
houses for such things as work dnys, exchanges, and
rushing, (ft is common practice 1o designate Saturday
as workday for all sophomores. Arid rain or shine, late
date or not, the sophomores must 101 l out. at !l a.m. to
cut the lawn, clean the house etc.)
2) The expense must be considered. Although fra
ternity hills are only slightly higher than most, the
cost of initiation dues, rushing and party assessments
must be figured in. (The average monthly house bill
is $83.90.)
3) Fraternity scholarship is no( the highest. The
fun-loving spiiit of a house sometimes proves a
di* traction from serious study.
4) The restriction i»i' individualism is a cost (hat
any rushee must consider. A pledge has no choice
of whether he wants to work or not. H»* must. Any
one thinking of a fraternity must accept this respon
sibility.
The purpose of this Bull Session has been to try to
give the prospective rushees some idea of what the
Stanford fraternity is and how it differs from houses
elsewhere.
The decision to join or not, is an individual thing that
should be thought out carefully. The eating clubs have
many of the advantages of fraternities and not as
many ol the disadvantages. Rating clubs have a lot to
offer and bear serious consideration. But in the end
the decision is your own.
