## USC Daily Trojan Sends Reporter to Drunk Tank 
### 
The Daily Trojan believes in giv
ing its readers the true facts of the
matter even if at the'expense of a

paign, the Trojan sent one of its
men to the local drunk tank for a
night to gel an inside story on con
ditions there.

Exams were tense at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin. After questions
had been handed out in one of the
history courses a student rose to his
feet, shouting denunciation. He re
fused to take the exam because he
felt it was "an insult to our intel
ligence."
"It has about as much imagina
tion as a pile of sawdust," he said.
"This requires a regurgitation of the
material in the course. I'm nause
ous and going out for some fresh
air."
As for the professor, he comment
ed, "The student should have
walked out quietly."

We don't know for sure what the
situation was at the Rose Bowl, but
Illinois students were not satisfied
about seats they've had in other
games. They complained in a let
ter to the Daily Northwestern
against "the university's policy of
giving extremely poor seats to the
Illinois students who attend the
Northwestern - Illinois football
games.
The complainants seemed to feel
lliey were being discriminated
against in the matter of seating.
Tht letter ended with a hope that
Illinois students would receive bet
ter treatment the next time. May
he they felt better after New Year's.

Television may be expensive at
Duke University. The administra
tion proposed construction of a new
"master" aerial so that any living
group may tie into it. The catch is
$100 payment for the privilege.â€”
