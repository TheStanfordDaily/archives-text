### 
WASHINGTONâ€”The 82nd Con
gress opens its election-year session
at noon tomorrow with members
generally agreeed that politicking
and investigations will slow law
makers to a crawl.
House Republican Leader Joseph
W. Martin Jr. underscored this at
titude today when he said he ex
pects the session will be a long one
but predicted that it will not pro
duce much legislation.
Most returning Congressmen feel
President Truman stands a good
chance of getting most of his de
fense requests but little else. They
said the session probably will con
centrate on political talk and inves
tigations of federal waste and cor
ruption and Communism.
