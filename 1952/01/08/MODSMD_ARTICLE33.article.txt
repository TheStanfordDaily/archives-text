# Rooters' Jam-up Improved at Bowl
## 
### 
Mr. Young, manager of opera
tions of tl 10 Athletic Department,
and Bill Otter;,on, chairman of Ral
ly Com, both commented yesterday
that, it was virtually impossible to
keep non-Stanford students out of
the footing section at the Rose
Bowl.
The main concentration was on
squeezing the anticipated 0,800 root
ers into the section in an orderly
fashion. Mr. Young said this was
accomplished with no trouble ex
cept lor a small overflow into one
aisle, and with a better result than
at the Big Game.
Due to fear of creating a jam be
cause of the number of rooters'
tickets sold, no one was checked
for student body cards at the en
trances.
