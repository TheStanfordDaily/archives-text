# McColl Stars In Huls Bowl
## 
### 
Bill McColl, giant Stanford wing
man, again proved he was a true All-
American as he speared two touch
down passes in last Sunday's Hula
Bowl game, played before 25,000 in
the Hawaiian Islands-. A group of
college all-stars, led by McColl, Mich
igan State's Al Dorow, and Ohio
State's Vic Janowicz defeated a group
of Hawaiian all-stars by the garrish
score ot 41-40. The Hawaiian stars
were bolstered by American pro stars
Frankie Albert and Kyle Rote.
Gary Kerkorian, Stanford's all PCC
quarterback, was scheduled to call
signals for the college stars but the
injured back he received in the Rose
Bowl kept him out of action.
McColl's performance in this and
Stanford's eleven other games has
set pro scouts from virtually all the
pro teams on his trail. McColl, in a
recent interview, stated that he'd be
willing to play pro ball if it didn't
interfere with his studies to become
a medical student. The amount of
money offered to him meant nothing,
he claimed.
