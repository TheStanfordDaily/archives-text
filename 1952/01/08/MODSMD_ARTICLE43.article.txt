# Stanford Hoopsters Will Meet Cal Next
## 
### DICK KLEIN 
With their two toughest confer
ence games behind them, the high
scoring Indian basketball five began
drills yesterday afternoon for the
next leg in their bid for loop hon
ors. The Cards gained a split with
the racehorse Bruins in their own
sweatbox gym over the weekend.
This split left the Indians in first
place in the Southern Division
along with the three other teams.
Stanford, USC. UCLA, and Cal all
have a similar 1-1 record. The pic
ture may clear up this next week
end when all four teams see action
in Friday and Saturday night doub
le-headers.
Bob Burnett, new varsity men
tor, sent his second- and third
stringers against each other most
of the aiternoon. First, the second
five worked on plays against a com
bination of coaches and jayvees.
This was half-court stuff.
Then both strings played fast
break ball lull c.ourt with every
thing wide open. Coach Burnett
emphasized tightening up the press
ing defense all over the court.
Ollie Suzdaleff, improving soph,
has worked himself into a regular
first-string guard spot and looked
very good over the weekend. The
other forward spot along with Ed
die Tucker is still a wide open fight
between Bill Stevenson, Hon fom
sic, and Dave Epperson.
Paul Johnson, starting guard at
the beginning of the season, is in the
hosptial with yellow jaundice. He
began to come down with it over
the trip to Kansas City and then
went to the hospital last Thursday.

He is still there now.
Otherwise the team is in good
physical condition. The first five
reported late to practice and spent
most of the time working out lightly
and practicing shots.
This weekend's opposition will be
provided by an erratic California
quintet. The Bears beat the rough
SC Trojans last Friday, but lost the
next night. Troy, weary from a long
road trip throughout the nation, was
not up to its usual game, and thus,
the results are not a true indication
ol the relative strengths.
Friday's game will be in the Stan
ford Pavilion, and then the next
night the same two teams move
over to the Berkeley Bear lair.
