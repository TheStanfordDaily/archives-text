# Card Braves Play Menlo; Prep for Bear Battles
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Stanford's JV's will make their
winter quarter debut tonight at 8
in Menlo JC's termite-ridden gym.
The game will give Coach Gus Cha
valas a chance to determine a start
ing five for the upcoming tilts with
the Cal Ramblers this weekend.
The Braves have thus far beaten
San Mateo JC, Fremont, and Balboa
High Schools while losing to the
COP JV's and Sacramento JC by
minute margins.
The JV's have shown the same
style of run-and-shoot basketball
that their varsity brothers employ.
They have plenty of height and am
ple reserves. Only their inexperi
ence has slowed them down. Four
frosh and a soph will probably start
the game, although, again like the
varsity, Coach Chavalas will un
doubtedly clear the bench to keep
his men fresh.
Starting at forward for the Braves
will be Russ Lawler, (>-ft. G-in. frosh
from Salinas High School. Dick
Carver, 6-ft. 2-in. frosh, will han
dle the other forward post. Dick's
brother Ralph played for the In
dians three years ago.
John Ramsey, another skyscraper
at (J ft. 4 in., will probably open at
center. Diminutive Wayne Lock
hart, a real hustler, will start at
guard while George Karras, a 5-ft.
11-in. soph, will open at the other
guard slot. Karras will be playing
against his old team-mates tomor
row as he is a transfer from Menlo.
The starting five has varied
through the year and the above

I line-up is very unofficial.
The team has junked its hectic
full-course press that featured the
Braves' first contests, for a more
conservative but still features a
wide - open "aggressive man-to
man" defense.
All in all, it's a colorful aggrega
tion, laden with good future var
sity material.
