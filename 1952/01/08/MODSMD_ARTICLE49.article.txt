A doctor w ■ consulted. He said
thai Lapli; in ei! her had: (1) spinal
menin'iii., in which case it would
be harmful lo move him, or (2)
polio, in which e>r.( he would prob
ably die il they did NOT move him.
A Itig l>c< ision
Thai was the choice offered to
four young ;»irls .•tuck in the middle
of some mounl linous eounlry, 21)1)
miles born the rvuresl medical aid,
wilh a hov hardly able to breathe
and dying ol . oiuelhing they knew
not what.
They decided to try to get Lap
ham to Mexico City. It was pour
ing rain when they set out at 4 p.m.
Sunday St am was rising from the
narrow, tortuous mountain road.
While Nancy gripped the wheel and
kept the car nosing ahead at a
snail's pace, .lane, Pal, and Joan
peered out the side windows and
told her how far they were from
each side ol the road. In the mean
time they had to keep the suffer
ing Lapham comfortable in the
back seal. As their altitude in
creased, his breathing became more
and more strained.
Unshed lo Iron Limg
Al 10 thai night they glimpsed
the lighl ol Mexico City. As Joan
Brainson put;, il, "They looked
pretly good."'
Al the hospital in the city Lap
ham was placed in an iron lung—
one al two in the entire country.
On Tile dav nielli Lntiham almost

rliecl. Recovery soon started, how
ever, and after a two months' stay
in the Mexican hospital, an Army
Ail' Force plane flew him to San
Francisco, to the Children's Hospi
tal.
At home, now. I-apham is out of
I the iron lung except, for a tempo
; rary respirator which he uses at
night. The paralysi: in his hands is
I rapidly improving and he hopes to
're - enter Stanford possibly next
I summer or fall.
March of Dimes Aid
For the March of Dimes part in
his son's recovery, Lapham's fa
j ther had this to say:
"We spent $10,000 of our own
J before; we asked for help. And
they've spent at least $5,000. II il
weren't for the March of Dimes not
many people could stand the ex
pense.
"Before, we just I brew in our
few dimes to the campaign every
j year, but now that polio has struck
1 us, we realize what that drive
means."
