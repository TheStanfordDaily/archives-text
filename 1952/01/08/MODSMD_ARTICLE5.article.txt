SHAPE. Kocqenrourt, France —
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower an
nounced today that if drafted lie
would run as Republican Presiden
tial candidate this year.
I'he Allied supreme commander
in Europe emphasized that he would
not seek the Presidential nomina
tion under any circumstances, nor
would he engage in any campaign
for convention delegates.
But lie gave his boosters in the
United States the go-ahead to try
to win him the draft—"a clear-cut
call to political duty," as he put it—
while he carries on here.
