# Norwegian Scholar Full of Praise For Stanford's Famed Informality

### BARBARA TUERK 
"To he treated not as a lor
eigner but as just one more
Stanlord student, that is the most
exciting part of being here." In
this belief Anton Zemer, a Busi
ness School grad student from
Oslo, Norway, typifies the many
exchange students whose
American education only starts
with book-learning.
Anion, who is attending the Uni
versity on Fullhright and Smith-
Mutull scholarships, cannot piaise
American iniormality enough. "(Jet
a cun of beer in your hand and you
might have known everyone for
years."
Iteronstrurtiiig a typical lii si
conversation, Anton could not
suppress his characteristic grin.
"What country are you from?"
"Norway."

()h, tlien you must lie a good
skier." (The answer is 'no.') Or
possibly: "It's cold there, isn't if?"
One American teacher introduced
a new twist into the conversation
with the query, in all seriousness,
"Have you churches in Norway?"
In answei to those who claim that
American universities are mere
play schools, Anton is extremely
impressed by the amount of time
students here do spend at their
work. The difference is in the
amount of independent study. Eu
ropeans substitute comprehensive
exams every two or three years for
our weekly assignments, papers,
and quarterly finals.
Also, Biz School here Is more
practical, less theoretical, than the
Norwegian School of Business Ad
ministration and Economics from
which he graduated last year.
Already Anion, like many for
eign students, has seen a good
part of the United States, inelud
inn Berkeley, where he look a

six iveeks' oriental ion course Inst
summer.
His first impression <<112 America
I was one familiar to many a weary
! traveler; lie couldn't find a single
porter anywhere on the New York
i docks, finally managing to procure
| a baggage cart, he was hauling his
| own trunk when a policeman stop
! ped him. "Don't you know we got
[ labor unions, buddy?"
His lirsl impression of Califor
nia was even less prepossessing.
He almost lost his wallet and
1 to two eon men playing a "head
and tail" game in the Los Aivje-
I les Airport. "Everyone is so
friendly here. They seemed no
different."
Besides Now York and l.o:> An
geles he has .seen many California,
Oregon, and Nevada national parks,
in a 1,350-mile drive that included
a side-trip to Harold's Club.
Plans include still more travel
, during vacations and this summer,
j before a return home by way of the
j Olympic Games in Helsinki.
The Stanford institution thai im-
I presses him most is the wealth of
extra - curricular activity. "It's so
j mueh more school-like here," he
S laughed, quoting the exchange
dance poster in his Village dormi-
I tory. "Twenty girls, count them,
(twenty. Exciting Shimmering!
Passionate . . . !"
