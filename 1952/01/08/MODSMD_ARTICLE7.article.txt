# Government Of France Voted Out
## No Confidence In Pleven Program 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 7 (UP)-The French
government fell today when the
National Assembly voted no confi
dence in Premier Rene Pleven's
"realistic" budget balancing pro
gram for increasing taxes and slash
ing social security expenses.
Pleven's right-of-center coalition
was toppled by a vote of 341 to 243,
in the first of eight confidence votes
the premier had asked on his budg
et project.
The government—France's 14th in
five years—had been in office since
last Aug. 11.
A strange coalition of leftists and
rightists combined to turn thumbs
down on the shaky, harassed gov
ernment. Voting against Pleven
were the Socialists, the Communists,
the right-wing followers of General
Charles de Gaulle, and some right
ist independents.
French President Vincent Auiiol
formally accepted Pleven's resigna
tion tonight and quickly began
talks with party leaders to find a
new premier.
Auriol first saw former Premier
Edouard Herriot in the latter's ca
pacity as president of the Assembly.
Others in the stream of presidential
visitors included former Premiers
Henri Queuille and George Bidault
and outgoing Deputy Premier Rene
Mayer.
It was the Socialists, however,
who swung the vote against Pleven.
The Socialist party decided at the
last minute today to throw in its
104 Assembly votes against the con
fidence motion.
In calling for a 10 per cent tax
increase and sharp government
economies in such red-inked na
tional enterprises as the railroads
and the social security system, the
premier had irritated almost ev
ery major political group in the As
sembly.
The Socialists, who generally had
backed the government, refused to
support Pleven on the social secu
rity cutbacks. When Pleven said he
would reconsider that part of his
program, the right-wing Radical
Socialists led by Deputy Premier
Rene Mayer, threatened to bolt the
government.
The left wing of the Catholic Pop
ular Republicans (MRP) also dis
liked the idea of slashes in the so
cial welfare program, while its right
wing, along with the Peasant party
and many independents, joined the
Radical Socialists against the tax
program.
The ensuing political tug-of-war
further undermined a government
that had become increasingly weak
under the strain of the nation's de
fense costs and the Indo-Chinese
war.

PARIS, Jan. 7 (UP)-The French
government fell today when the
National Assembly voted no confi
dence in Premier Rene Pleven's
"realistic" budget balancing pro
gram for increasing taxes and slash
ing social security expenses.
Pleven's right-of-center coalition
was toppled by a vote of 341 to 243,
in the first of eight confidence votes
the premier had asked on his budg
et project.
The government—France's 14th in
five years—had been in office since
last Aug. 11.
A strange coalition of leftists and
rightists combined to turn thumbs
down on the shaky, harassed gov
ernment. Voting against Pleven
were the Socialists, the Communists,
the right-wing followers of General
Charles de Gaulle, and some right
ist independents.
French President Vincent Auiiol
formally accepted Pleven's resigna
tion tonight and quickly began
talks with party leaders to find a
new premier.
Auriol first saw former Premier
Edouard Herriot in the latter's ca
pacity as president of the Assembly.
Others in the stream of presidential
visitors included former Premiers
Henri Queuille and George Bidault
and outgoing Deputy Premier Rene
Mayer.
It was the Socialists, however,
who swung the vote against Pleven.
The Socialist party decided at the
last minute today to throw in its
104 Assembly votes against the con
fidence motion.
In calling for a 10 per cent tax
increase and sharp government
economies in such red-inked na
tional enterprises as the railroads
and the social security system, the
premier had irritated almost ev
ery major political group in the As
sembly.
The Socialists, who generally had
backed the government, refused to
support Pleven on the social secu
rity cutbacks. When Pleven said he
would reconsider that part of his
program, the right-wing Radical
Socialists led by Deputy Premier
Rene Mayer, threatened to bolt the
government.
The left wing of the Catholic Pop
ular Republicans (MRP) also dis
liked the idea of slashes in the so
cial welfare program, while its right
wing, along with the Peasant party
and many independents, joined the
Radical Socialists against the tax
program.
The ensuing political tug-of-war
further undermined a government
that had become increasingly weak
under the strain of the nation's de
fense costs and the Indo-Chinese
war.
