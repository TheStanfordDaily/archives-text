# Thief of Rare Rocks Sought
## 
### 
Several hundred of the Geology
Department's rarest rock specimens
were stolen from the Mineralogy
Building sometime during the re
cent vacation, Geology Department
Head Charles Park told campus po
lice yesterday.
Estimating the loss to be "far in
excess of $1,000," Dr. Park said that
the Geology Department's working
collection is destroyed.
Many of the specimens, the geol
ogist reported, are irreplaceable. He
said that one rock from Western
Australia was one of two specimens
known .
A quick check of the collection
revealed that only the more color
ful specimens had been taken, lead
ing police to theorize that the thief
must have been a layman at rock
collecting*
Surprised at the number of rocks
missing, Park said that the thief
"must have employed a pick-up
truck to cart away the stolen rocks."
Park claimed that it would re
quire several years to replace the
stolen material "taken from what
was considered an outstanding col
lection." Park reported that geo
logic experimentation would be
hindered by the thousand - dollar
loss.
Park and his assistants are cur
rently taking inventory of the col
lection to determine the exact loss.
The robbery was discovered yes
terday upon resumption of class
work. The rocks were stored in a
second-Hoor laboratoiv of the Min
eralogy Building.
