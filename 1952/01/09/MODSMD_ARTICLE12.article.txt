throughout, led to little audience
shift of opinion in last night's Tuesday
Evening Sei ies However, Ihe Stan
told debaters, arguing against the

In the Final balloting thirty-foui
members of the audience remained

prosal, and 7 shifted in favor of ibrj
question, "Resolved: That Federalism
has been a good servant and is I e~
coming a bad master."
Millhouse Began
After an introduction by Dr.
Thomas A. Bailey, Australian de
bater h'obin Millhouse started the
formal debate by staling one of lh
major premises for the proposal; that
the federal form of government, when
it First originated in both America and
Australia was the only way for a
union of states but federalism em
ployed Loo rigid a constitution for
the present world situation.
"History will not be cramped be
hind unalterable constitutions," he
said. Millhouse cited the government
of Germany before World War II as
an example of a weak construction
that led people to turn to Hitler.
John Reid, the other Australian de
bater, in defense of the proposal, said
that at first Federal governments had
the most harmless powers when de
fense and foreign affairs were not
such large scale problems as they
are today. He said that during crises
such as depressions and wars the
balance of power under federalism
caused delay and inefficiency and
caused a loss of separate powers that
might not be regained on the pai l of
the nation and the state.
. Myers for Farm
Chandler Myers spoke first for
Stanford, saying that in heterogene
ous nations diversity of opinions and
institutions and individuals freedoms
are best protected by a federal gov
ernment He said that the weaknesses
were in the administration and not
the form of federalism.
Stanford's Rhodes Scholar, Alan
Enthoven stated that the creative and
protective possibilities contained in
federalism with diversity causes
progress and encourages experimen
tation. He added that unitary stales
have not solved government prob
lems in a better way.
Following the first speeches each
debater spoke in rebuttal of the op
ponents' points. Questions were then
asked by members of Ihe audience.
