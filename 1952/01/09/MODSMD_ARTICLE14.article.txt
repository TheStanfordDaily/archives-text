# Group Discusses Sport Play-Down

### 
A special sports committee of college presidents drew up a
set of six recommendations aimed at college athletic de emphasis
Monday night, amounting to the most drastic proposals yet of
i fored.
The recommendations are:

I That all post-season games of any
kind be abolished.
2. That basketball games anil prac
tice be confined to the period between
! Dec. 1 and March IT).
That baseball games and practice
j be confined to the period between
March I and commencement.
I. That no freshman be allowed to
play on a varsity team, and that any
transfei from a junior college should
J put in a year of residence before
! being allowed to play.
5. That scholarships should be given
I strictly on the basis of a student's
educational ability and his needs.
t>. That in no case should any
scholarship be for more than the edu
cational expenses at an institution.
The committee was set up by the
I American Council of Education of
j which Stanford, along with 975 other
universities, colleges, and school sys
tems is a member. The recounnenda-
I tions go next to the executive com-
I mittce of the council for actionâ€”ap
proval or disapproval.
University President Wallace
Sterling told The Daily last night
lie woudl decline comment until
the recommendations arc in a
more concrete stage. The Council
lias no authority to enforce any
decree, hut Stanford, as a member,
could presumably he affected
should the recommendations lie ap
prover!.
Commenting on the recommenda
tions, Don Licbcndorfer, athletic news
service director, said a requirement
| that junior college transfers spend a
i year in residence at the new school
j before eligibility, would affect the
I Coast much more seriously than any
other section of the country, because
of the large number of junior colleges
in the area.
He said Stanford's allowing fresh-

t
men to compete in varsity athletics,
a practice which would be prohibited
if the recommendations were passed
and enforced, was a mistake made
by many universities in "tnisguessing
the inroads the armed services would
make in athletic personnel."
He pointed out that Stanford ad
inits athletes only when the.v con
form to the strict scholastic re
quirements of the admissions office
and that scholarships include tui
tion only here, while the commit
tee's recommendation would limit
them to "tuition, hoard, lodging,
and hooks."
Commenting on the general de
emphasis trend, he said he thought
the PCC has adequate rules to pre
vent athletics from getting out of
hand. "What is needed is a general
honesty and a willingness to abide
by the rules both as to lettei and
spirit."
