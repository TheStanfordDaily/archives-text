The University <Â»112 Southern Cali
fornia has finally had a peak in the
Sierra Nevada mountains named in
its honor, 55 years after Stanford and
the University of California got their
peaks.
Trojan Peak, the newly named
crag, is about live air miles from Mt.
Whitney, and is 13,968 feet high.
From its summit arc visible Mt. Stan
ford which is 15 feet higher and Uni
versity Peak which is much lower
than Trojan Peak.
Name Official in August
In I!KJ(i two USC Alums submitted
the name Southern California Peak
to the U.S. Board on Geographic
names. The Board sent back the
suggestion of the name Trojan Peak
to which the alums agreed. This name
became official last August.
Three SC alumni promptly set out
to dedicate the peak and placc a metal
box atop it containing a brief history
of the university and copies of the
Trojan oath and motto.
The dedication climb on Aug. 21,
1051 was the ninth ascent of the
mountain. The third ascent was made
by four Stanfordil.es in 15KK5.


TOWERING TOMMY -University of Southern California stu
dents and alumni would have us believe that Tommy Trojan,
their symbol, looks down from Ihe recently named Trojan Peak
just like the Greek gods on Olympus. Rut after carefully exam
ining the photograph, The Daily thinks the picture is a clever
job of superimposing.
