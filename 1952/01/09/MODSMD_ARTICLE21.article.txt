Three Reclv/ood City teen-agers
have been tabbed by campus police
as the Christmas - holiday thieves
whn rifled the Geology Depart
ments rock collection and stole
several hundred "irreplaceable"
rock specimens valued in excess of
$1,000.
The youths were contacted at
their homes Monday night by Cam
pus Police Chief Gordon Davis.
Between 200 and 250 ol t,ie stolen
rocks have been recovered, but po
lice say some 75 rare stones are still
missing.
Aged M and 15 years, die youths
come from "comfortably fixed"
homes, police report. Chief Davis
described the three as "bright"
youths who are amateur geologists
"with a surprising knowledge about
minerals."
Each of the teen-agers has an ex
tensive mineral collection, police
said.
Davis was led to the three youths
by a Stanford geology student who
recalled seeing the trio troupe in
and out of the Geology Building
several times one day during the
recent vacation. Curious, the Stan
fordite quizzed the three and ob
tained their names.
Valuable Roths Missing
The highly prized Western Aus

youths "were not playing square
with officials" and were "holding
out" on some specimens. The chief

boxes that once contained the more
valuable minerals. The Chief re
ported that the trio disclaimed any
knowledge of what had become of
the minerals.
Plotted at Open House
The youths became aware of the

during a recent Geology Depart
ment open house. The youths have
confessed plotting the robbery dur
ing the open house festivities.

tigators claim that the Redwood
City rock enthusiasts carried then
loot from the Geology Building a
stone at a time to escape detection.
Davis described the theft as "a very
systematic rifling of the collection "
The rock - robbery will cripple
geologic experimentation, according
to Dr. Charles I' - . Park, dean of the
School of Mineral Sciences. He said
sever;il of the still missing speci
mens are vital to current tests.
Police oflicials said yesterday that
no charges have been filed against

homes, police report. Chief Davis
described the three as "bright"
youths who are amateur geologists
"with a surprising knowledge about
minerals."
Each of the teen-agers has an ex
tensive mineral collection, police
said.
Davis was led to the three youths
by a Stanford geology student who
recalled seeing the trio troupe in
and out of the Geology Building
several times one day during the
recent vacation. Curious, the Stan
fordite quizzed the three and ob
tained their names.
Valuable Roths Missing
The highly prized Western Aus
tralian rock, one of two specimens
known to science, was not among
the rocks returned ,Davis reported.
Davis said that he believed the
youths "were not playing square
with officials" and were "holding
out" on some specimens. The chief
said the youths returned empty sev
eral of the specially lined specimen
boxes that once contained the more
valuable minerals. The Chief re
ported that the trio disclaimed any
knowledge of what had become of
the minerals.
Plotted at Open House
The youths became aware of the
extensive Stanford rock collection
during a recent Geology Depart
ment open house. The youths have
confessed plotting the robbery dur
ing the open house festivities.
Reconstructing the crime, inves
tigators claim that the Redwood
City rock enthusiasts carried then
loot from the Geology Building a
stone at a time to escape detection.
Davis described the theft as "a very
systematic rifling of the collection "
The rock - robbery will cripple
geologic experimentation, according
to Dr. Charles I' - . Park, dean of the
School of Mineral Sciences. He said
sever;il of the still missing speci
mens are vital to current tests.
Police oflicials said yesterday that
no charges have been filed against
the teen-agers but that they would
not escape unpunished.
Three Reclv/ood City teen-agers
have been tabbed by campus police
as the Christmas - holiday thieves
