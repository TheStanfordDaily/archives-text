Thp best movf in many a day was started
by the Bookstore this quarter when they ex
tended their weekend and evening hours to
take care of textbook buyers. Student reaction
was uniformly favorable.
What may be just aE important, the Book
store management is satisfied, too. Mrs. Helena
Bachou, Bookstore manager, said the extended
hours resulted in much shorter lines, better
service and a less crowded store. The Book
store plans to operate on the same basis at the
beginning of next quarter.

Excom's interest in the liquor problem con
tinues. A printed resolution with Excom's rec
ommendation that the legal drinking age be
lowered to IB has been sent to state schools
and California legislators. Excom wants to de
termine public reaction to theii proposals.
For that matter, Excom wants to know student
reaction, too. There's no better way for students
to make their opinions known than to attend
meetings. Tonight's agenda looks a bit on the
dull side, so there should be ample time for
interested students to ask questions and find

out answers.
We might add that all Excom meetings arp
open to the student body, Excom meets every
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the council room
of the Union Building.

Trosh and transfers are being bombarded
with the advantages and disadvantages of join
ing fraternities or eating clubs during these
busy rush days. So it was something of a sur
prise when a fellow dropped into the office
yesterday with this suggestion: "Why not tell
about the advantages ol being a non-orcjaniza
iicn man?"
A non-organization man, presumably, is the
student who for one reason or another eludes
fraternities and clubs and finds himself free
from any affiliation at year's end. And certainly
there are a lot of advantages to campus inde
pendence.
Perhaps the important point to be made in
thp discussion of advantages and disadvantages
of joining and non joining is this: You don't
lose on any point unless you accept the social
myth that lratermties or clubs have some mys
tic prestige. That's a good idea to forget.

take care of textbook buyers. Student reaction
was uniformly favorable.
What may be just aE important, the Book
store management is satisfied, too. Mrs. Helena
Bachou, Bookstore manager, said the extended
hours resulted in much shorter lines, better
service and a less crowded store. The Book
store plans to operate on the same basis at the
beginning of next quarter.

Excom's interest in the liquor problem con
tinues. A printed resolution with Excom's rec
ommendation that the legal drinking age be
lowered to IB has been sent to state schools
and California legislators. Excom wants to de
termine public reaction to theii proposals.
For that matter, Excom wants to know student
reaction, too. There's no better way for students
to make their opinions known than to attend
meetings. Tonight's agenda looks a bit on the
dull side, so there should be ample time for
interested students to ask questions and find

out answers.
We might add that all Excom meetings arp
open to the student body, Excom meets every
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the council room
of the Union Building.

Trosh and transfers are being bombarded
with the advantages and disadvantages of join
ing fraternities or eating clubs during these
busy rush days. So it was something of a sur
prise when a fellow dropped into the office
yesterday with this suggestion: "Why not tell
about the advantages ol being a non-orcjaniza
iicn man?"
A non-organization man, presumably, is the
student who for one reason or another eludes
fraternities and clubs and finds himself free
from any affiliation at year's end. And certainly
there are a lot of advantages to campus inde
pendence.
Perhaps the important point to be made in
thp discussion of advantages and disadvantages
of joining and non joining is this: You don't
lose on any point unless you accept the social
myth that lratermties or clubs have some mys
tic prestige. That's a good idea to forget.
