### GOSH, IT'S SKI TIME PETE GROTHE 
In the course of normal conversation about skiing,
many people ask me what kind of a skier I am. And
I tell them.
In case you are interested in what kind of a schusser
I am, and you have a perfpct right not to be interested,
1 will tell you.
Just picture, if you will, a yodeling daredevil of a
skier gliding down the slopes 50 miles an hour. This
skier, who is raimented in $1,000 worth of Norwegian
ski equipment, nevei separates his skis more than
half an inch unless he decides to scHncc rJnnm the

slopes using the ice skating
method. He is the picture of
grace and rhythm as he noncha
lantly takes an occasional 20 foot
jump when the situation offers it
self His blond hair ripples in the
breeze and his tanned face pro
vides a fitting contrast to the
glistening white snow.
Have you got the picture?
Okay, forget it, because this is
not I.

Now picture, if you will, a skier who wears Levis,
boots, and $1.97 worth of ski equipment (his skis.)
He can't negotiate the bunny slope without falling
down every five feet. Thereby leaving a sizable
sitzmark which he neglects to fill up.
Have you got the picture? Okay, forget it, be
cause this also is not I.
No : I fit into the third classification. I am the guy
who watches the yodeling daredevil, tries to copy him,
and talis into the sitzmark left by the beginner.
This is why two female Daily tiyoutees are now
bathing my ankle in hot watet. as I write this. "No,"

I keep telling them, "Pannameia did not tackle me"

While on the subject of skiing, I must relate an
incident that gives substance to Dick McLean's anti
language requirement argument.
A Stanford student, who we'll call John, was doing
a spot of skiing at Yosemile's Badger Puss. He was on
one of the steeper slopes when he saw eight Spaniards
trying to ski. And they were amazingly unsuccessful
at it. These Spaniards, who couldn't speak a lick of
English, were accounting for a lot of sitzmarks and
were not filling them up.
Of course, John realized that the first rule of skiing
is that you fill up your sitzmarks, and he felt, it his
duty to inform the Spaniards of this. Now John had
taken three years of Spanish at Stanford, had received
reasonably good grades, and finally was given a golden
opportunity to use it. John politely told the Spaniards
that it would be a good idea to fdl up their sitzmarks,
and just to cinch the deal he demonstrated what lie
meant.
Something must have been lost in the translation,
because the Spaniards went all around the hill,
filling up all the holes they vaw, John was beginning
to fee) like a hamburger, but the worst was yet to
come.
Later in the afternoon, John noticed thai onp of
the Spaniards was having an uncommon amount of
difficulty. John pulled up to him with a snow-spray
ing christie, and laboriously said, "Seria mis faeil si
saca sus skis y anda abajo. (It is easier if you
take off your skis and walk downhill)."
The Spaniard gave John an ii ritating glance and said,
"Okay, thanks."
It it were possible, John would have melted into
the nearest sitzmark.
