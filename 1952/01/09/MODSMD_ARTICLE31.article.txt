# How Sororities Dethroned in'44
## 
### 
Tlio nine women's houses up on the Row were not lonrj ago llio
scene of the same annual rushing activities as the men's fraterni
ties are today.
In the early days of its establishment the University was faced
with housing and financal dificulties, so charters were granted 1o

campus living groups.
At first, ten houses (one sorority
later disbanded) were enough to
handle at. least most of the famous
five hundred girls who wished to
join a sorority. As the number of
girls admitted increased, the ratio
changed. II they didn't pledge, they
were placed in specified dorms,
while the men had their choice be
tween dorms and living off campus.

A Daily editorial described the
sorority situation of early 1943:
"We all had a good time Saturday
night . . . but a lot of us still
couldn't forget, that for every exu
berant young freshman pledge we
danced with, there were two back
at Roble who weren't so happy. . . .
"And it detracted from our fun to
realize that some of these girls may
consider themselves failures when
we know they are not."
Through the years the sororities
had become a rather tight-knit so
cial elite class. Sheer arithmetic
had worked to that end. A poll ta
ken at Hohle during the latter stage
in the life of sororities at Stanford
showed that one-third more of the
girls wanted to pledge than the so
rorities could handle.
Members Limited
Each sorority was strictly limited
as to the number of girls it could
admit, as none of the members
could live off campus. Although
there were enough social and extra
curricular activities girls in the dor
mitories could participate in it they
wished, much pressure to pledge
came from the outside.
Often there was the problem of
explaining the ? itu.ition to sorority
minded citizens of Laketov.n, Min
nesota. Many children of alumni
were entering school and the par
ents couldn't understand wliy their
child had not been able to join "the
house mother was in."
The heartbreak tor some of not
pledging was increased because the
University was such a close-knit
community tliat the girl who tried
and failed was conspicuous.
Resides the small number of so
rorities on campus, another prob
lem was thai many wills hied for
the to) j four with all their energies

and wouldn't accept bids from the
others.
Too Many Grievances
Roble sponsors, composed of both
sorority and dormitory women, de
cided in 194!f that the matter should
be brought to a head in view of the
cumulative effect of the grievances
that appeared during each rushiri:'.
period.
They started by consulting Cap
and Gown and found that the ma
jority of members favored abolish
ing- all the sororities. Dr. Ray l.y
man Wilbur then appointed three
women who in turn selected theii
own committees to study the whole
situation.
Many students (bought at the
time that sororities would never be
abolished. Wealthy alumni who
were constantly exerting pressure
to retain the institutions were im
portant to the University finan
cially.
Action in '44
In 1944, after the issue had been
studied thoroughly, Dr. Donald l».
Tresidder called a meeting in Cub
berley Auditorium of all the soro
rity women. When he had finished
reviewing the steps leading up to it,
he announced the Board of Trustees
had authorized him to announce
that sororities on campus would be
discontinued and women's housing
unified under University ownership
and supervision.
The girls in the packed audito
rium rose to applaud Dr. Tresidder
as he left, and a moment later broke
into tlie hymn, which be told them
was "the nicest thing you could
have done."
As one of the members of the
commission said after submit ting
the plan, "We are not here to deny
the advantages of sororities in othei
places, but we do not believe that
the system is suitable to our cam

he announced the Board of Trustees
had authorized him to announce
that sororities on campus would be
discontinued and women's housing
unified under University ownership
and supervision.
The girls in the packed audito

into tlie hymn, which be told them
was "the nicest thing you could

In the early days of its establishment the University was faced

campus living groups.

five hundred girls who wished to

danced with, there were two back
at Roble who weren't so happy. . . .
"And it detracted from our fun to
realize that some of these girls may
consider themselves failures when
we know they are not."
Through the years the sororities
had become a rather tight-knit so

rorities could handle.
Members Limited
Each sorority was strictly limited
as to the number of girls it could
admit, as none of the members
could live off campus. Although
there were enough social and extra
curricular activities girls in the dor
mitories could participate in it they
wished, much pressure to pledge
came from the outside.
Often there was the problem of
explaining the ? itu.ition to sorority
minded citizens of Laketov.n, Min

were entering school and the par
ents couldn't understand wliy their
child had not been able to join "the

The heartbreak tor some of not

University was such a close-knit

wished, much pressure to pledge
came from the outside.
Often there was the problem of
explaining the ? itu.ition to sorority
minded citizens of Laketov.n, Min
nesota. Many children of alumni
were entering school and the par
ents couldn't understand wliy their
child had not been able to join "the
house mother was in."
The heartbreak tor some of not
pledging was increased because the
University was such a close-knit
community tliat the girl who tried
and failed was conspicuous.
Resides the small number of so
rorities on campus, another prob
lem was thai many wills hied for
the to) j four with all their energies

and wouldn't accept bids from the
others.
Too Many Grievances
Roble sponsors, composed of both
sorority and dormitory women, de
cided in 194!f that the matter should
be brought to a head in view of the
cumulative effect of the grievances
that appeared during each rushiri:'.
period.
They started by consulting Cap
and Gown and found that the ma
jority of members favored abolish
ing- all the sororities. Dr. Ray l.y
man Wilbur then appointed three
women who in turn selected theii
own committees to study the whole
situation.
Many students (bought at the
time that sororities would never be
abolished. Wealthy alumni who
were constantly exerting pressure
to retain the institutions were im
portant to the University finan
cially.
Action in '44
In 1944, after the issue had been
studied thoroughly, Dr. Donald l».
Tresidder called a meeting in Cub
berley Auditorium of all the soro
rity women. When he had finished
reviewing the steps leading up to it,
he announced the Board of Trustees
had authorized him to announce
that sororities on campus would be
discontinued and women's housing
unified under University ownership
and supervision.
The girls in the packed audito
rium rose to applaud Dr. Tresidder
as he left, and a moment later broke
into tlie hymn, which be told them
was "the nicest thing you could
have done."
As one of the members of the
commission said after submit ting
the plan, "We are not here to deny
the advantages of sororities in othei
places, but we do not believe that
the system is suitable to our cam
pus."
