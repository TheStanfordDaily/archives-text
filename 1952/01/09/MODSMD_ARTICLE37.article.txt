Question for today—ls Stanford able to win the 1951-52 basketball cham
pionship?
Today's answer—Yes!
Rephrase the question to read, "Will Stanford win the championship?"
and you don't get an answer. *
At least, not now.
The reason for this is that we've peeked behind the scenes and come
up with a lew observations which may hurt someone, but which should be
brought to light before it's too late.
First of all, we'd like to say that we believe that the present Card cage
aggregation is the finest the Farm has seen in ten years. Ed Tucker, Jim
Ramstead, and Jim Walsh are outstanding, Oleg Suzdalef and freshman
Ron Tomsic are fast becoming so, and the Indians are, for the first time in,
10, these many years, loaded with reserves.
This last statement may come as a shock to oldtimers who haven't seen
a full Stanford bench in any sport since before the war, hut, nevertheless,
the Red basketballers have it.
To top it all nil, the Indian quintet is under the tutelege of a new coach,
Boh Burnett, bringing forth a situation similar to the 1951 Card football
team. Burnett learned his haskethall methods under Everett Dean, who
retired as Stanford's head haskethall coach last spring to take up his
baseball coaching duties full time.

Dean was a past master at the art
of teaching the hoop game and taught
a brand of ball full of finese and good
sportsmanship. He intermingled a
philosophy of life with his basket
ball, and both were unexcelled.
To our way of thinking, however,
there was one thing that Dean didn't
add and that was the vigor and fire
for a hard-fought game. There were
reasons for this, but we won't go into
them. Bob Burnett, on the other
hand, has not only brought to the
Farm the same finese and good
sportsmanship that Dean tought, but
he has also brought the word, "Fight!"
That word marks the present cage
team as better than average and
could easily make them great.
However, another word has popped
up which could just as easily destroy
this team, and that is "overconfi
dence." Overconfidence has ruined

more teams than anything else in the
realm of sports, because of the fact that there is such a fine dividing line
between confidence and overconfidence.
Every coach tries to build confidence in his men, and that's a fine attri
bute, for enough confidence can build a fire under an average team and
bring them out on top. The 1951 Stanford football team serves as an ex
cellent example.
Sometimes, though, a coach will carry his confidence-building course
too far, and before long his boys will be sitting on the other side of their
laps waiting for the championship to he presented to them.
To date we can't say the Card cagers have done this, but we have seen
signs. of it developing. The main reason for this is that almost every man on
the team is an excellent shot and can score 15 to 20 points ori a given night.
Don't get us wrong. We've got nothing against them scoring 20 points
apiece, but this situation could easily develop into splitting a five man team
into five individual stars, and five stars with a bad or mediocre night can
lose ;i lot of ball games.
The Indians have a great season ahead of them, and we believe they
can win the crown, hut it takes teamwork.

ROSE BOWL AFTERMATH—From the looks of things at the moment
the 1951 Stanford Rose Bowl team could go down in history as the team
that killed the Rose Bowl. The way the sportswriters talk these days the
only reason the PCC and Big Ten will go through with their present contract
is because no one school has enough guts to say, "Let's quit now." Perhaps
it's also because no school wants to throw away the extra cash resulting
from the Rose Bowl any sooner than necessary.
At any rate, it looks like post-season games are on the way out. These
post-season games have increased since the war to a point of hilarity, and
we're in favor of seeing most of them knocked off, but we'll put ourselves on
record as favoring the retaining of the Rose, Cotton, Orange, and Sugar
Bowls and the East-West game. Perhaps a revision of contracts in some cases
would be desirable, but if they throw them all out, how are we going to
kill our hangovers New Years Day.
In fact, what would New Years Day be without a football game?
One other point we'd like to bring out in regards to the discontinuance
of ;i PCC-Big Ten contract for the Rose Bowl: If the PCC gives up now
and throws in the towel, it's going to throw the Pacific Coast brand of
football right into the same boat the PCL is in now—a minor league. It
will show to one and all that we're not in the same league with inidwestern
squads, and before long the outstanding high school athletes on the coast
will be heading east for their "higher education."
Just because the Big Ten representatives have beaten us six times running
on January l.;t, why give up? In pre-season games we've beaten them just
as much. Besides, look at San Jose State. In all the years they've been
coming up here to play Stanford, they have never once won a game. And
yet they still keep coming back.
Let's not give up yet. We're just getting warmed up.
