# McElyea Will Defend His Crown In All-University Golf Tournament
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's outstanding golfing
event of the year, the annual All-
University Tournament, will offi
cially get under way next week.
Golf Coach Bud Finger announces
that qualifying will start immedi
ately, however, and will last until
Jan. 20. The sign-up sheet is in
the pro shop.
Anyone enrolled in the Univer
sity, whether graduate or under- j
graduate, may enter the tourna
ment, and entrance fee will he one
dollar. The first round must be
completed on or before Jan. 27; the
second round, Feb. 3; the third
round, Feb. 10: the semi-finals, Feb.
17; and the final raund will be
played on March 2. Thirty-two
men will qualify in the champion
ship flight. The tournament will be
medal play.
There will be a total of four prizes
given: one for low gross, one for low
qualifying score, one for the winner,
and one for the runner-up. The
Stanford Athletic Department, in
order to insure a better selection,
will furnish the prizes at cost.
The tournament is traditionally
the outstanding Stanford golfing

event and one of the more impor
tant contents in the Eay Area. The
competition has always been out
standing. A good indication of this
lies in the fact that Lawson Little,

twice National and British Amateur
champion, and a former Stanford
student, could never win the Stan
ford All-University Tournament.
The defending champion will be
Dick McElyea, Stanford's number
one varsity golfer. Bob Crozier, at

one time also a team member, won
the tournament in 1949 and '50.
Along with McElyea, outstanding
undergrads who will be in the tour
nament this year include Fred
Brown and Warren Dailey, who are
freshmen, and Paul Palmquist, Art
Schroeder, Dick Taylor, Otis Win
ters, Roland Conklin, Grant Spaeth.
Keith Beekman, and Stu Ledbc tter.
The graduate students will also
be well represented by John Elliott,
Stanford's number five varsity golf
er last year, and a large number of
students graduated from other
schools.
Former tournament champions
include Art Doering, a top - jlight
professinoal golfer; Bud Brownell,
holder of the Stanford course rec
ord; Warren Berl and George Trap
hagen, former team members; and
Bud Finger, Stanford's golf coach
and an outstanding pro.

Schroeder, Dick Taylor, Otis Win
ters, Roland Conklin, Grant Spaeth.
Keith Beekman, and Stu Ledbc tter.
The graduate students will also
be well represented by John Elliott,
Stanford's number five varsity golf
er last year, and a large number of
students graduated from other
schools.
Former tournament champions
include Art Doering, a top - jlight
professinoal golfer; Bud Brownell,
holder of the Stanford course rec
ord; Warren Berl and George Trap

DICK McELYEA
—Defending champion
Stanford's outstanding golfing
event of the year, the annual All-
University Tournament, will offi
cially get under way next week.
Golf Coach Bud Finger announces
that qualifying will start immedi
ately, however, and will last until
Jan. 20. The sign-up sheet is in
the pro shop.
Anyone enrolled in the Univer
sity, whether graduate or under- j
graduate, may enter the tourna
ment, and entrance fee will he one
dollar. The first round must be
completed on or before Jan. 27; the
second round, Feb. 3; the third
round, Feb. 10: the semi-finals, Feb.
17; and the final raund will be
played on March 2. Thirty-two
men will qualify in the champion
ship flight. The tournament will be
medal play.
There will be a total of four prizes
given: one for low gross, one for low
qualifying score, one for the winner,
and one for the runner-up. The
Stanford Athletic Department, in
order to insure a better selection,
will furnish the prizes at cost.
The tournament is traditionally
the outstanding Stanford golfing

event and one of the more impor
tant contents in the Eay Area. The
competition has always been out
standing. A good indication of this
lies in the fact that Lawson Little,

twice National and British Amateur
champion, and a former Stanford
student, could never win the Stan
ford All-University Tournament.
The defending champion will be
Dick McElyea, Stanford's number
one varsity golfer. Bob Crozier, at

one time also a team member, won
the tournament in 1949 and '50.
Along with McElyea, outstanding
undergrads who will be in the tour
nament this year include Fred
Brown and Warren Dailey, who are
freshmen, and Paul Palmquist, Art
Schroeder, Dick Taylor, Otis Win
ters, Roland Conklin, Grant Spaeth.
Keith Beekman, and Stu Ledbc tter.
