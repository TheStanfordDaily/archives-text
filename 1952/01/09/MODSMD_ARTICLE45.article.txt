# African Student Cites Exploitation
## 
### DAVE BERNARD 
Last Afiica is not as it appeared in the movie "King Solomon's
Minos," according to Mungai Njoroge, a good looking citizen of
Nairobi and pre-med student here this year.
He leels that the story gives an incorrect representation of the
people, making the East African appear culturally backward.

Alum- willi tin . leeling, Mungai be
lieve. that the African would be
better of! it be continued in bis own
civilization, even though the Brit
ish are probably more advanced sci
entifically.
"We like the British individually,
but we hate British imperialism, ex
ploitation, and domination. We want
independence, which means, among
other things, complete control of the
government," he continued.
The British largely control Ken
ya's economic resources, coffee, cot
ton, tea, dairy products, and thus
arc able to maintain their high
standard of living. The European
standar I is high, while that of the
native; is low. There are six and a
half million natives in the territory
of Kenya as compared with 30,000
Europeans.
BviliSU I xploitation
Education is one of the examples
Mungai cited in relation to British
exploitation. There are four high

schools, each accommodating 200
students, for the natives. They are
neither compulsory nor free. The
young British, however, have more
than adequate educational facilities
which are free and compulsory.
Most of them usually seek their ed
ucation in England.
There are no schools in Kenya
enrolling both British and East Af
ricans. There is also no college.
Racial discrimination exists, but
j is social, not legal. The schools are
ian example. Although the British
j frown upon racial intermarriage,
I the condition exists. Often the East
| Africans go to England, where ra
| cial bigotry is almost non-existent,
! marry there, and return home.
I
(Government Interference
Government is another example
of British exploitation, according to
I Mungai. The British rule through
i legislative councils, composed of a
majority of British citizens. These
members are elected by the British,
for the natives are not allowed to
! vote. A small number of Africans
I are nominated by the British gov
ernor and thereby allowed to hold
office.
Leaving Kenya's problems, Mun
| gai commented that the weather in
| bis land is better than California's,
j Although soccer, followed by tennis,
! volleyball, and hockey are Kenya's
| main sports, Mungai enjoys watch
ing American football.
About Women
He refused to express an opinion
on Stanford women, but said East
I African girls have weaknesses for
nylons and high heels just as Amer
icans do, but don't use as much
make-up. Kenya courtship is simi
lar to that of the United States in
I that neither requires a chaperone.
j Heavy moral restraints are en
j forced in East Africa.
Along with his Stanford studies,
Mungai is working on the French
language. He already speaks four
languages: Swahili. the official lan
guage of East Africa, Kikuyu, Lu
ganda, and English.

The British largely control Ken

standard of living. The European

BviliSU I xploitation
Education is one of the examples
Mungai cited in relation to British
exploitation. There are four high

schools, each accommodating 200
students, for the natives. They are
neither compulsory nor free. The
young British, however, have more
than adequate educational facilities
which are free and compulsory.
Most of them usually seek their ed
ucation in England.
There are no schools in Kenya
enrolling both British and East Af
ricans. There is also no college.
Racial discrimination exists, but
j is social, not legal. The schools are

Government is another example
of British exploitation, according to
I Mungai. The British rule through
i legislative councils, composed of a
majority of British citizens. These
members are elected by the British,
for the natives are not allowed to
! vote. A small number of Africans
I are nominated by the British gov
ernor and thereby allowed to hold
office.

About Women
He refused to express an opinion
on Stanford women, but said East
I African girls have weaknesses for
nylons and high heels just as Amer
icans do, but don't use as much
make-up. Kenya courtship is simi

I that neither requires a chaperone.

Along with his Stanford studies,
Mungai is working on the French
language. He already speaks four
languages: Swahili. the official lan
guage of East Africa, Kikuyu, Lu

Last Afiica is not as it appeared in the movie "King Solomon's

He leels that the story gives an incorrect representation of the
people, making the East African appear culturally backward.
