## Gales Peril ‘Enterprise’ Skipper May Leave Ship 
### 
FALMOUTH. England, Thursday
Jan. 10 (UP)—Rough seas and a
threatened gale brought new perils
today to the helpless Flying Enter
prise, but the strong winds were
blowing the crippled freighter away
from the treacherous English coast
toward France.
Capt. Henrik Kurt Carlsen made
plans to abandon ship should it
founder in the new storm expected
before dawn, but a late report from
the area said the heroic captain and
his companion, Kenneth Dancy,
turned in to get some sleep after
their heartbreaking failure yester
day to get a new tow line aboard
the ship.
A broken towlinc set the cracked
and leaking vessel adrift early yes
terday 30 miles ofT Britain's south
ernmost tip—the graveyard of ships.
Attempts to replace it failed as 25-
foot waves smashed the Enterprise
and threatened to wash Carlsen and
Dancy into the sea.
The huge waves eliminated all
hope of attaching a new line before
dawn—and a forecast of new gale
winds made it seem almost impos
sible to attach a line then. The
storm was expected to hit around 4
a.m. (8 p.m. PST Wednesday) with
winds up to 46 miles an hour.
