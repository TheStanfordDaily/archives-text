# UN Rejects Red Offer

### 
TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 10
(UP) — The United Nations re
jected today for the second time
a Communist counterproposal
on supervising a Korean armis
tice and the Panmunjom talks
remained in deadlock with no
compromise in sight.
With each new report of no prog
ress from Panmunjom the belief in
creased that only high-level inter
vention could break the impasse.
The UN command rejected the
Red proposal lor the same reason
it rejected it yesterday—the Reds
failed to write into it a ban on the
construction of airfields during an
armistice period. The Allies were
firm and the problem was thrown
back to the Communists.
Maj. Gen. Howard M. Turner
told the Communists that after
they amplified their remarks "we
arrive at the same conclusion that
we did after preliminary study.
Your proposal of Jan. !) is inac
ceptable to the UNC because of
your failure to include restric
tions oil the rehabilitation of mili
tary airfields during an armis
tice."
Both tides used their old argu
ments in this morning's wranglings
with Chinese Maj. Gen. Hsieh Fank
repeating the Communist line that a
ban on airfields constitutes an in
terference in North Korean internal
affairs and Turner again demanding
security for UN troops.
Hsieh said the Reds might or
might not build airfields during
the armistice but that it was none
of the United Nations' business.
This, Turner said, "brought clear
ly into focus that our differences
concentrate on airfields." The two
sides already had proclaimed an
insoluble deadlock on the issue.
Meanwhile, an Allied raiding
party fell back to its lines on the
West Korean front at dawn yester
day after eight hours inside Com
munist positions on a kill-and-dc
stroy mission. The raiders attacked
an enemy-held hill northwest of
Yonchon, in the Seoul invasion cor
ridor just above the 38th parallel.
