# Asians Can Apply for Scholarships
## 
### BARBARA TUERK 
Ihe scope of next year's Foreign Scholarship Program will be
enlarged to allow students from Asia, the Near East, and Latin
America as well as from Europe to apply for one of the seven
special scholarships.
This policy of unrestricted applications was approved by Excom
last night on recommendation of the Foreign Scholarship Com-

mittcc. The living groups concerned
will continue to make the final se
lection of the foreign scholars whom
they house.
When Excom initiated the For
eign Scholarship Program in the
spring of IH4S, it decided to limit
possible applicants to Europeans for
the following reasons:
1. The proportion of Asiatic
students (mostly from China and
India) already enrolled mi the
campus was relatively high, com
pared to the European group.
2. The costs of publicizing the
scholarships and of transporta
tion for the winners are much
higher in Asia than in Europe.
'I. Since European culture is
closer to our own, living groups
felt that it would he easier for
European students to adjust to
American ways.
In the four years that the program
has been in effect, all but one of the
28 scholars have come from Euro
pean nations. The one exception,
Reiko Ishikawa, came to the United
States last year at the special re
quest of Lagunita Court.
Phil Saeta and Dick Weisman,
co-chairmen of the committee this
year, have promoted the plan to

open up next year's scholarships to
the entire world for several reasons.
In the Ihst place, today as nev
er before the focal point of the
world is in the Fast. Roth the
Korean war and the troubles in
Iran and Egypt have centered at
tention on the neeil for increased

understanding between Arneri
eans and Asiatics, an understand
ing that can best l>c brought ahoul
by increased contact he'ween the
peoples themselves.
Secondly, the many Asiatic stu
dents already enrolled at. the Uni
versity through their own resources
are not always as truly representa
tive of their nations as scholarship
winners might he. The awards,
based on need, will make it possible
lor less wealthy students to come
to this country .
Moreover, the scholarship provi
sions place the ASSU foreign schol
ars in a different living group each

quarter, and arrange speaking en
gagements and tours for them. In
this way, the special scholars are
able to pick up a broader picture of
life in this country, and at. the same
time to spread their own contri
butions more widely than individ
uals here under their own auspices.
Finally, Fullbright funds now cut
down transportation costs for Asi
atic students, where formerly these
costs were prohibitive.
A survey conducted (his fall
found that l>agunita and the
Women's flow houses were in fa
vor of unrestricted applications,
and (he fraternities were gener
ally favorable (o the plan.
The Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee was set up in 1948 as a tempo
rary committee of the ASSU, hut
will soon become permanent upon
the submission and acceptance of a
constitution. It has the largest
budget, $4,500 annually, of any
ASSU sub-committee.
Its work includes co - ordinating
the activities of the many groups
contributing to the Foreign Schol
arship Program, and acting as a
preliminary screening board to se
lect the group of candidates from
whom the living groups choose
their scholars.
ASSU funds pay for half the tui
tion of (he seven foreign scholars
(the University donates the other
half), for their books, and in cer
tain cases for their travel expen
ditures. The living groups supply
room and board, and sometimes
spending money.

Ihe scope of next year's Foreign Scholarship Program will be
enlarged to allow students from Asia, the Near East, and Latin
America as well as from Europe to apply for one of the seven
special scholarships.
This policy of unrestricted applications was approved by Excom
last night on recommendation of the Foreign Scholarship Com-

mittcc. The living groups concerned
will continue to make the final se
lection of the foreign scholars whom
they house.
When Excom initiated the For
eign Scholarship Program in the
spring of IH4S, it decided to limit
possible applicants to Europeans for
the following reasons:
1. The proportion of Asiatic
students (mostly from China and
India) already enrolled mi the
campus was relatively high, com
pared to the European group.
2. The costs of publicizing the
scholarships and of transporta
tion for the winners are much
higher in Asia than in Europe.
'I. Since European culture is
closer to our own, living groups
felt that it would he easier for
European students to adjust to
American ways.
In the four years that the program
has been in effect, all but one of the
28 scholars have come from Euro
pean nations. The one exception,
Reiko Ishikawa, came to the United
States last year at the special re
quest of Lagunita Court.
Phil Saeta and Dick Weisman,
co-chairmen of the committee this
year, have promoted the plan to

open up next year's scholarships to
the entire world for several reasons.
In the Ihst place, today as nev
