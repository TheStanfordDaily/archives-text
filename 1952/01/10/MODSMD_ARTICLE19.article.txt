# Library Sale Draws Many Farm Students
## 
### 
By far the most crowded place on
campus yesterday was the lower
lobby of the library, where students
gathered at the first surplus-book
sale in the history of the Stanford
Library. Of the 2,500 books dis
played at 8 a.m., only a few hun
dred were still remaining at 4 p.m.
The varied taste of Farm students
in reading matter was aptly dis
played in purchases of books rang
ing from an early edition of "Little
Lord Fauntferoy" to a eulogy of
United States Steel.
Books in foreign languages
seemed among the most popular
buys. Quite a few exceptional books
were dug out by eager students,
one of them purchasing the com
plete works of Shakespeare, in an
illustrated, antique edition, at !ft
cents a volume for six volumes.
Reasons for purchases were many
and varied. One Stanford Rough,
lugging an immense volume to the
desk, blurted, "Well, I can't get a
footstool for live cents!"
As a result of the tremendous re
sponse to the sale, the library hopes
to conduct similar sales quarterly.
