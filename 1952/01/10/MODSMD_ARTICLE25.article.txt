# War Peril, Big Taxes Loom, Warns Truman
## Solons Hear ’52 Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UPi-
President Truman warned today
that the danger of world war is
"still very real" and laid down
for the nation a tough 1952 pro
gram of greater defense produc
tion, more foreign aid and con
tinued high taxes.
In his annual State of the
Union message to Congress, Mr.
Truman also called for tougher
wage-price controls and in
creased social security benefits,
and said he will recommend still
further increases in the size of
the armed services, especially
air power.
To faint applause from botii
Democrats and Republicans, th«-
President also went down the line
for his "fair deal" program with
two slight exceptions.
He asked for national health in -
surance, improved farm price .sup
ports, civil rights and revision of the
Taft-Hartley law. But he did not
specifically demand an FEPC law nor
spell out his health requests, now un
der special study.
The President also made a bid for
an election-year armistice on ex
cessive politics, saying that "we have
a great responsibility to conduct our
political fights in a manner that does
not harm the national interest."
With British Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill following his words
intently from the gallery, Mr. Tru
man grimly told a .joint session of
the House and Senate that ''the
world still walks in the shadow of
another world war." Then he add
ed:
"The only thing that can defeat us
is our own state of mind. We can lose
if we falter."
Churchill's reaction to the Presi
dent's address was: "wasn't that
good?"
Republicans failed to agree. They
said it was merely a repetition of
past messages and predicted this
was the last time it would be heard.
Senate GOP leader Styles Bridges
(N.H.) called it"the same old poli
tical hash."
Most Democrats, conscious that this
is an election year, shied away from
commenting on many of the presi
dent's proposals, particularly his
"fair deal" program and his remarks
on taxes.
But Senate Democratic Leader Er
nest W. McFarland (Ariz.) called it
"a constructive speech which pro
vides plenty of thought for Con
gress." Speaker Sam Rayburn said
it was a "sane, sound report 011
world and domestic conditions."
Sen. Robert A. Taft, candidate
for the Republican presidential
nomination, took notes as Mr. Tru
man defended his "bi-partisan"
foreign policy. Taft yawned widely
at one point when Mr. Truman said
this is not the time for "grumbling."
Mr. Truman drew applause, mostly
from the Democratic side, when he
promised to fire "dishonest" govern
ment employes and received a solid
band from both Democrats and Re
publicans when he called for "fail"
administration of the tax laws.
In giving Congress a generalized
review of the world situation to
gether with his program for the
"crucial year" 1952, the President
warned that Russia is producing
more warplanes than the United
States and all the free nations com
bined."
Chairman Lyndon B. Johnson
(D-Tex.) of the senate prepared
ness committee seized on this state
ment as the high point of the presi
dential address. He hoped that
"our officials will recognize thf
grim implications of this fact" and
do something about it.
Some Republicans agreed that,
military spending will continue high
and that military aid still must be
extended to anti-Communist na
tions. But they served notice that
money requests for both will be
closely scrutinized.
Democrats and Republicans alike
made clear that any request for high
taxes will have rough sailing.

Sen. Robert A. Taft, candidate

this is not the time for "grumbling."
Mr. Truman drew applause, mostly

administration of the tax laws.
In giving Congress a generalized

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UPi-
President Truman warned today
that the danger of world war is
"still very real" and laid down
for the nation a tough 1952 pro
gram of greater defense produc
tion, more foreign aid and con
tinued high taxes.
In his annual State of the
Union message to Congress, Mr.
Truman also called for tougher
wage-price controls and in
creased social security benefits,
and said he will recommend still
further increases in the size of
the armed services, especially
air power.
To faint applause from botii
Democrats and Republicans, th«-
President also went down the line
for his "fair deal" program with
two slight exceptions.
He asked for national health in -
surance, improved farm price .sup
ports, civil rights and revision of the
Taft-Hartley law. But he did not
specifically demand an FEPC law nor
spell out his health requests, now un
der special study.
The President also made a bid for
an election-year armistice on ex
cessive politics, saying that "we have
a great responsibility to conduct our
political fights in a manner that does
not harm the national interest."
With British Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill following his words
intently from the gallery, Mr. Tru

the House and Senate that ''the
world still walks in the shadow of
another world war." Then he add

"The only thing that can defeat us
is our own state of mind. We can lose
if we falter."
Churchill's reaction to the Presi

good?"
Republicans failed to agree. They
said it was merely a repetition of
past messages and predicted this
was the last time it would be heard.
Senate GOP leader Styles Bridges
