### DICK McLEAN 
HINTS TO RUSHEES
Unfortunately, rushing is not much fun for rushees.
They seem to be too confused and too worried to
en oy the parties and the entertainment thrown their
way. And yet it need not be this way.
Rushing can be enjoyable.
I've seen a lot of confused, mentally distraught kids
during the weeks of intensive rushing. They usually
fall into two types: the kid who is afraid that he won't
be asked, and the kid who has been asked by a couple

of houses.
The first fellow thinks that if he
hasn't been asked right away, he
isn't going to be asked at all. He
worries, grows discouraged, and
will pledge any house whether he
likes that partcular house or not.
What this rushee should remem
ber is: These first weeks mark
only the beginning of rushing. It
continues on for the rest of the
year. Any fraternity is always on
the lookout for good men. The

houses realize that they miss much maiei'icu in
the hectic scramble of rush weeks. The formal sign
ing of pledges is a long way from the end of rushing.
The idea that the fraternities have their classes all
picked out before the season begins is a lot of bunk.
The second fellow has been to several houses and
is being rushed hard by a couple of them. He likes
three houses and finally decides that he likes one
better than the rest and would like to accept the
bid from that one. But he worries, "Will the guys
in the other two houses be sore at me for turning
them down?" This fellow is worried for nothing.
Fraternities expect to have this happen. No house
gets everybody it wants. The fraternity attitude in
this case is, "Win a few, lose a few. It's all in the
game."'
Here are some specific questions and answers:
Q) Which are the best houses?
A) The houses that you like. To pledge a fraternity
simply because it has a good physical plant, athletes,
or a supposed name is no way to decide on which fra
ternity. It would be as impossible for me to name the
best houses as it would be to name the best foods.
Everybody has their own tastes. Choosing a house is
like going to a smorgasbord table. Take what you like,
not what you're told is good.
Q) When should I pledge?
A) This is a tough question. The advantage of
pledging early is that you have some voice in choosing
the rest of the pledge class. The advantage of pledging
late is that you have a little more time to shop around.
(Let me throw in here that it is usual practice with a
house to hold a bid open once it is made.) Often a
fellow wonders if he's made a mistake when he takes

a pin too soon. But just as often a fellow who waits
too long is so confused that he can't make up his mind.
So to answer the above 1 would say—pledge a
house when you're fairly sure that that is the house
for you. You may not he positive but that is normal.
You can turn in a pledge pin any time up to formal
signing and most houses are reasonable about releas
ing a dissatisfied pledge even after formal pledging.
Q) How can I get into a house?
A) By simply being natural. Fraternities are look
ing for all types and no freshman need assume an.
attitude that he thinks the Greek letter houses want.
Too many rushees get nervous and give a bad im
pression when they don't mean to. Stay loose. You
have more fun that way.
While I'm about it I might rattle off a few specific
hints. "Frat" was originally a term of derision toward
fraternities. It's a good word not to use during rush
ing. Don't worry about not remembering names.
You'd have to be a genius to recall all the ones that
get thrown at you. But if you feel that you'd like to
tie a face to a name somewhere, get a copy of last
year's Quad where you'll find house pictures with the
names underneath. (It's a good place to find the name
of a pretty feminine face that you see somewhere
around Stanford. That good old Quad!) Don't drink
too much at the parties. You're liable to wake up with
a couple of strange looking pledge pins on your pa
jamas.
Now for a closer, here is a true story.
It was the first night of open houses and the rush
chairman had the men whipped up into a frenzy.
"Now get out there and rush," was his last tearful
exhortation.
Five minutes later at 7:15 sharp, a slight short fellow
knocked at the fraternity house door.
"Come right on in," boomed someone, "My name is
Joe Zilch and this is . . They introduced the follow
around. "Would you like a coke?" they asked.
"Why yes," said thp short fellow looking a bit sur
prised.
"How do you like Stanford?" the rush chairman
asked.
"Fine, I guess," said the follow.
"Where's your home?" asked the house president.
"On Mayfield Avenue," answered the boy finishing
his coke.
"Are you a freshman or a sophomore?" someone
asked.
"Not either," answered the lad, "I'm in the eighth
grade at El Portal School. Thank you for the coke
but can I have the 85 cents for the paper now. I've
got to make other calls tonight."
When the kid walked out the door with his 85 cents,
he wondered why nobody said "goodby" or "good
night" or anything.

"How do you like Stanford?" the rush chairman
asked.
"Fine, I guess," said the follow.
"Where's your home?" asked the house president.
"On Mayfield Avenue," answered the boy finishing
his coke.
"Are you a freshman or a sophomore?" someone
asked.
"Not either," answered the lad, "I'm in the eighth
grade at El Portal School. Thank you for the coke
but can I have the 85 cents for the paper now. I've
got to make other calls tonight."
When the kid walked out the door with his 85 cents,
he wondered why nobody said "goodby" or "good
night" or anything.

HINTS TO RUSHEES
Unfortunately, rushing is not much fun for rushees.
They seem to be too confused and too worried to
en oy the parties and the entertainment thrown their
way. And yet it need not be this way.
Rushing can be enjoyable.
I've seen a lot of confused, mentally distraught kids
during the weeks of intensive rushing. They usually
fall into two types: the kid who is afraid that he won't
be asked, and the kid who has been asked by a couple

of houses.
The first fellow thinks that if he
hasn't been asked right away, he
isn't going to be asked at all. He
worries, grows discouraged, and
will pledge any house whether he
likes that partcular house or not.
What this rushee should remem
ber is: These first weeks mark
only the beginning of rushing. It
continues on for the rest of the
year. Any fraternity is always on
the lookout for good men. The

houses realize that they miss much maiei'icu in
the hectic scramble of rush weeks. The formal sign
ing of pledges is a long way from the end of rushing.
The idea that the fraternities have their classes all
picked out before the season begins is a lot of bunk.
The second fellow has been to several houses and
is being rushed hard by a couple of them. He likes
three houses and finally decides that he likes one
better than the rest and would like to accept the
bid from that one. But he worries, "Will the guys
in the other two houses be sore at me for turning
them down?" This fellow is worried for nothing.
Fraternities expect to have this happen. No house
gets everybody it wants. The fraternity attitude in
this case is, "Win a few, lose a few. It's all in the
game."'
Here are some specific questions and answers:
Q) Which are the best houses?
A) The houses that you like. To pledge a fraternity
simply because it has a good physical plant, athletes,
or a supposed name is no way to decide on which fra
ternity. It would be as impossible for me to name the
best houses as it would be to name the best foods.
Everybody has their own tastes. Choosing a house is
like going to a smorgasbord table. Take what you like,
not what you're told is good.
Q) When should I pledge?
A) This is a tough question. The advantage of
pledging early is that you have some voice in choosing
the rest of the pledge class. The advantage of pledging
late is that you have a little more time to shop around.
(Let me throw in here that it is usual practice with a
house to hold a bid open once it is made.) Often a
fellow wonders if he's made a mistake when he takes

a pin too soon. But just as often a fellow who waits
too long is so confused that he can't make up his mind.
So to answer the above 1 would say—pledge a
house when you're fairly sure that that is the house
for you. You may not he positive but that is normal.
You can turn in a pledge pin any time up to formal
signing and most houses are reasonable about releas
ing a dissatisfied pledge even after formal pledging.
Q) How can I get into a house?
A) By simply being natural. Fraternities are look
ing for all types and no freshman need assume an.
attitude that he thinks the Greek letter houses want.
Too many rushees get nervous and give a bad im
pression when they don't mean to. Stay loose. You
have more fun that way.
While I'm about it I might rattle off a few specific
hints. "Frat" was originally a term of derision toward
fraternities. It's a good word not to use during rush
ing. Don't worry about not remembering names.
You'd have to be a genius to recall all the ones that
get thrown at you. But if you feel that you'd like to
tie a face to a name somewhere, get a copy of last
year's Quad where you'll find house pictures with the
names underneath. (It's a good place to find the name
of a pretty feminine face that you see somewhere
around Stanford. That good old Quad!) Don't drink
too much at the parties. You're liable to wake up with
a couple of strange looking pledge pins on your pa
jamas.
Now for a closer, here is a true story.
It was the first night of open houses and the rush
chairman had the men whipped up into a frenzy.
"Now get out there and rush," was his last tearful
exhortation.
Five minutes later at 7:15 sharp, a slight short fellow
knocked at the fraternity house door.
"Come right on in," boomed someone, "My name is
Joe Zilch and this is . . They introduced the follow
around. "Would you like a coke?" they asked.
"Why yes," said thp short fellow looking a bit sur
prised.

too much at the parties. You're liable to wake up with
a couple of strange looking pledge pins on your pa
jamas.
Now for a closer, here is a true story.
It was the first night of open houses and the rush
chairman had the men whipped up into a frenzy.
"Now get out there and rush," was his last tearful
exhortation.
Five minutes later at 7:15 sharp, a slight short fellow
knocked at the fraternity house door.
"Come right on in," boomed someone, "My name is
Joe Zilch and this is . . They introduced the follow
around. "Would you like a coke?" they asked.
"Why yes," said thp short fellow looking a bit sur
prised.
"How do you like Stanford?" the rush chairman
asked.
"Fine, I guess," said the follow.
"Where's your home?" asked the house president.
"On Mayfield Avenue," answered the boy finishing
his coke.
"Are you a freshman or a sophomore?" someone
asked.
"Not either," answered the lad, "I'm in the eighth
grade at El Portal School. Thank you for the coke
but can I have the 85 cents for the paper now. I've
got to make other calls tonight."
When the kid walked out the door with his 85 cents,
he wondered why nobody said "goodby" or "good
night" or anything.

HINTS TO RUSHEES
Unfortunately, rushing is not much fun for rushees.
They seem to be too confused and too worried to
en oy the parties and the entertainment thrown their
way. And yet it need not be this way.
Rushing can be enjoyable.
I've seen a lot of confused, mentally distraught kids
during the weeks of intensive rushing. They usually
fall into two types: the kid who is afraid that he won't
be asked, and the kid who has been asked by a couple

of houses.
The first fellow thinks that if he
hasn't been asked right away, he
isn't going to be asked at all. He
worries, grows discouraged, and
will pledge any house whether he
likes that partcular house or not.
What this rushee should remem
ber is: These first weeks mark
only the beginning of rushing. It
continues on for the rest of the
year. Any fraternity is always on
the lookout for good men. The

houses realize that they miss much maiei'icu in
the hectic scramble of rush weeks. The formal sign
ing of pledges is a long way from the end of rushing.
The idea that the fraternities have their classes all
picked out before the season begins is a lot of bunk.
The second fellow has been to several houses and
is being rushed hard by a couple of them. He likes
three houses and finally decides that he likes one
better than the rest and would like to accept the
bid from that one. But he worries, "Will the guys
in the other two houses be sore at me for turning
them down?" This fellow is worried for nothing.
Fraternities expect to have this happen. No house
gets everybody it wants. The fraternity attitude in
this case is, "Win a few, lose a few. It's all in the
game."'
Here are some specific questions and answers:
Q) Which are the best houses?
A) The houses that you like. To pledge a fraternity
simply because it has a good physical plant, athletes,
or a supposed name is no way to decide on which fra
ternity. It would be as impossible for me to name the
best houses as it would be to name the best foods.
Everybody has their own tastes. Choosing a house is
like going to a smorgasbord table. Take what you like,
not what you're told is good.
Q) When should I pledge?
A) This is a tough question. The advantage of
pledging early is that you have some voice in choosing
the rest of the pledge class. The advantage of pledging
late is that you have a little more time to shop around.
(Let me throw in here that it is usual practice with a
house to hold a bid open once it is made.) Often a
fellow wonders if he's made a mistake when he takes

a pin too soon. But just as often a fellow who waits
too long is so confused that he can't make up his mind.
So to answer the above 1 would say—pledge a
house when you're fairly sure that that is the house
for you. You may not he positive but that is normal.
You can turn in a pledge pin any time up to formal
signing and most houses are reasonable about releas
ing a dissatisfied pledge even after formal pledging.
Q) How can I get into a house?
A) By simply being natural. Fraternities are look
ing for all types and no freshman need assume an.
attitude that he thinks the Greek letter houses want.
Too many rushees get nervous and give a bad im
pression when they don't mean to. Stay loose. You
have more fun that way.
While I'm about it I might rattle off a few specific
hints. "Frat" was originally a term of derision toward
fraternities. It's a good word not to use during rush
ing. Don't worry about not remembering names.
You'd have to be a genius to recall all the ones that
get thrown at you. But if you feel that you'd like to
tie a face to a name somewhere, get a copy of last
year's Quad where you'll find house pictures with the
names underneath. (It's a good place to find the name
of a pretty feminine face that you see somewhere
around Stanford. That good old Quad!) Don't drink
too much at the parties. You're liable to wake up with
