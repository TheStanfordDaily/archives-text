# PROFESSORS SIZE UP CAMPAIGN
## Ike vs. Vinson or Taft vs. Truman Are Logical Presidential Opponents 
### BILL STOLTZE 
With Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's announcement
of "availability" for the Republican candidacy, politi
cal speculation as to the outcome of this year's presi
dential election has increased greatly here at Stanford
and throughout the nation.
With this in mind, The Daily has interviewed two
members of Stanford's Department of Political Science
to ascertain the opinions of experts in this country's
political affairs.
In October, The Daily published an interview with
Professor Thomas S. Barclay, also of the Department
of Political Science, for a Democrat's view on the
current political situation. This article contains an
interview with an avowed Republican, and one with
a professor who prefers to comment from a non
partisan viewpoint.
"Eisenhower will win the election if he obtains the
Republican nomination," predicted Professor Graham
H. Stuart, a Republican who specializes in the Po
litical Science of International Affairs.
Professor Stuart went on to explain that the South
ern states who carry a large number of votes at the
Republican convention, seem to be quite solidly ar
raigned behind Taft. In this way, they might swing
the GOP candidacy towards Taft, even though the
Southern vote in the actual election would not be the
deciding factor in choosing a president.
"On the other hand," said Stuart, "Taft's recent win
in the Ohio senatorial campaign, was against very
weak opposition, whereas Eisenhower is probably the
only candidate the Republicans can nominate with the
assurance that he can win."
"Should Eisenhower be selected Repviblican presi
dential candidate, Truman will probably not run," said
Stuart, "Chief Justice Frederick M. Vinson would

be the most likely Democratic presidential candidate
in that case."
In an interview with Professor Boyd A. Martin, a
visiting professor of Political Science from the Uni
versity of Idaho whose specialty is American political
parties, The Daily heard substantially the same opinion
as to the Taft-Eisenhower rivalry.
Professor Martin, summed up the Republican presi
dential candidacy race in this way: Eisenhower has
the vote-getting potentiality, but Taft has the advan
tage from the standpoint, of organization.
Said Martin, "Many Republicans may be willing to
take Ike because of his chances of winning the election.
However Taft has had the opportunity to line up the
old guard Republican organization which is a big ad
vantage."
Besides this, Martin stated that Ike has had 110
experience with party politics and usually an organi
zation doesn't like to see an "outsider" get the political
plum.
What would happen in case of a GOP eonventon
deadlock? Martin feels that Warren would have a
better chance as a compromise candidate than Stassen.
Turning to the Democratic party's nomination prob
lems, the political party expert agreed with Stuart
that Truman would likely oppose Taft whereas Vinson
would be a likely opponent for Eisenhower.
Vinson's strength lies in the fact that he hails from
a border state and his decisions in the Supreme Court
with respect to civil liberties have been sufficiently
conservative so as not to alienate the solid South.
"Vinson's experience in congress, as a cabinet-mem
ber, and as chief justice of the supreme court server,
to enhance his political potentialities too."
Who will be our next president? Even the experts
leave that decision to the reader.

partisan viewpoint.
"Eisenhower will win the election if he obtains the
Republican nomination," predicted Professor Graham
H. Stuart, a Republican who specializes in the Po
litical Science of International Affairs.
Professor Stuart went on to explain that the South
ern states who carry a large number of votes at the
Republican convention, seem to be quite solidly ar
raigned behind Taft. In this way, they might swing
the GOP candidacy towards Taft, even though the
Southern vote in the actual election would not be the
deciding factor in choosing a president.
"On the other hand," said Stuart, "Taft's recent win
in the Ohio senatorial campaign, was against very
weak opposition, whereas Eisenhower is probably the
only candidate the Republicans can nominate with the
assurance that he can win."
"Should Eisenhower be selected Repviblican presi
dential candidate, Truman will probably not run," said
Stuart, "Chief Justice Frederick M. Vinson would

be the most likely Democratic presidential candidate
in that case."
In an interview with Professor Boyd A. Martin, a
visiting professor of Political Science from the Uni
versity of Idaho whose specialty is American political
parties, The Daily heard substantially the same opinion
as to the Taft-Eisenhower rivalry.
Professor Martin, summed up the Republican presi
dential candidacy race in this way: Eisenhower has
the vote-getting potentiality, but Taft has the advan
tage from the standpoint, of organization.
Said Martin, "Many Republicans may be willing to
take Ike because of his chances of winning the election.
However Taft has had the opportunity to line up the
old guard Republican organization which is a big ad
vantage."
Besides this, Martin stated that Ike has had 110
experience with party politics and usually an organi
zation doesn't like to see an "outsider" get the political
plum.
What would happen in case of a GOP eonventon
deadlock? Martin feels that Warren would have a
better chance as a compromise candidate than Stassen.
Turning to the Democratic party's nomination prob
lems, the political party expert agreed with Stuart
that Truman would likely oppose Taft whereas Vinson
would be a likely opponent for Eisenhower.
Vinson's strength lies in the fact that he hails from
a border state and his decisions in the Supreme Court
with respect to civil liberties have been sufficiently
conservative so as not to alienate the solid South.
"Vinson's experience in congress, as a cabinet-mem
ber, and as chief justice of the supreme court server,
to enhance his political potentialities too."
Who will be our next president? Even the experts
leave that decision to the reader.
With Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's announcement
of "availability" for the Republican candidacy, politi
cal speculation as to the outcome of this year's presi
dential election has increased greatly here at Stanford
and throughout the nation.
With this in mind, The Daily has interviewed two
members of Stanford's Department of Political Science
to ascertain the opinions of experts in this country's
political affairs.
In October, The Daily published an interview with
Professor Thomas S. Barclay, also of the Department
of Political Science, for a Democrat's view on the
current political situation. This article contains an
interview with an avowed Republican, and one with
a professor who prefers to comment from a non
