## Let’s Have Yell Leaders and Band at Games 
### 
To the Editor:
Last year about this time some Stanford basket
ball ians traveled to Berkeley to cheer for their team
in the Cal-Stanford game. They were met with a
humiliating surprise—no cheerleaders, no band and
relatively few rooters. They saw opposite them an
army of Cal rooters seated around a thirty-piece band
and led by several yell-leaders. The din of the cheer
ing and music quite overpowered our few hapless fans
and might have contributed to our team's embarrass

ing defeat, by a score of 72 to 41.
On Friday and Saturday nights the Stanford bas
ketball team will again face Cal, 011 Saturday night
at Berkeley's Men's Gymnasium. We hope that his
tory will not repeat itself this year.
This is an invitation to the Stanford band and yell
leaders to attend the games. Our basketball team has
certainly been doing its best so far, and your support
inay help them tu continue 111 the same manner.
