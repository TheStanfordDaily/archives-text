# 'Seven Days to Noon' Has Suspense, Moral
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"Seven Days to Noon," now at the Guild, is more than a good,
gripping suspense film. It goes far deeper to grapple with a
poignantly modern moral issue: the use of atomic power as a
force of evil.
The problem is posed simply enough. A leading British atomic

scientist, who has eorne to be hor
rified by ihe use to which his life's
work lias been put, disappears.
With him, in a small black satchel,
he takes an atomic weapon. Then,
by mail, he gives the Prime Min
ister seven days in which to an
nounce the end of atomic weapon
manufacture.
If no such announcement is forth
coming, the scientist will blow up

the seat of gov
ernment in Lon
don. The movie
follows the
course of events
from the receipt
of the letter, at
first thought to
be just another
hoax perpetrated

by a crank, through to the climax
at noon on the fatal day.
The picture, a British import,
provides an interesting contrast to
Hollywood suspense stories. In typ
ical English fashion, it begins in a
low key and spreads its action over
a longer period of time, vising to
its climax in relatively slow steps.
Hollywood, undoubtedly, would
have condensed the period of time
into what the advertisements
would have railed "seven frantic
hours of agony and suspense."
American audiences, tuned to a
faster pace, may for (his reason
find "Seven Days" a hit slow
moving.
This, however, should not be the
case. It quite makes up for the hec
tic frenzy which Hollywood might
strive for with its perfect, step-by
step construction, its thoroughness,
its solid characterizations, its

thoughtful consideration of the
moral issue involved.
Another pleasure of the film is
its respect for audience intelli
gence. We are never beat over the
head with its message. Rather, we
are left to draw our own conclu
sions from the two substantial
cases presented: that of the gov
ernment (self - defense necessi
tates atomic stock - piling), and
that of the scientist (no measure
is too drastic to make man real
ize that this time he really is
inarching toward complete self
annihilation).
Interestingly, everyone in the pic
ture thinks of the scientist as little
more than a lunatic, a mental cas
ualty of his grave responsibility.
Matters are left at that point, but
the picture hereby makes a sad
commentary on the apparent im
possibility of penetrating society's
mind to point out its own stupidity.
The script leaves the audience to
realize that the lunatic is not, per
hdps, the scientist, but society it
self.
Good photography, effective back
ground music, and line perform
ances, notably by several of the mi
nor characters, all help to make
"Seven Days to Noon" a picture
which we recommend highly to ev
eryone.
