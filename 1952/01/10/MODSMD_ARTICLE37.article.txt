# PRO AND CAHN
## 
### 
Although (lit' Pacific Coast Conference standings don't prove it, we
see Stanford as now having an edge in the PCC southern division basket
ball race.
The .southern circuit, so the records show, is knotted with each of the
lour entries having dropped a game while winning a game. The important
iact is that Stanford has been on the road and has come home with a split
in two games with UCLA in the Bruins' home gym at Westwood. To beat
the Bruins in their small, overheated, highly partisan gym is a feat in itself.
Why, in two plus seasons the Uclans, three-time straight Southern Division
champs, have only lost three games at Westwood including the recent loss
to Stanford.
While Stanford and UCLA were mixing it up, USC and California were
Knocking themselves out earning a divide. This leads us to believe that
cither the Bears are stronger than their pre-season record showed, or that
ihe Trojans are a little poorer than doped out to be.
Itut at the moment the point of discussion is that the Indians don't
have to play in Westwood again this year. We meet the Bruins at home
in two games, Feb. It; and 17. We can he mighty tough at home. True,
Stanford does meet both Cal and SC away in two games apiece but they
will be picnics when contrasted to invading Uclan-land.
REBOUND WEAKNESS MAY PROVE CAGE DOWNFALL
We feel that the one thing that may hamper the Cards' cage chances this
season is lack of backboard strength. Currently Jim Ramstead is the boy
who has been collecting most of the rebounds. Olie SuzdalefT, Ron Tomsic,
and Fid Tucker are a bit too small to do too much on the boards, although
their all-round play more than compensates for this seeming weakness.
Jim Walsh does his reboundng share.
The loss of (i' 4" Don Carlson, through academic deficencies, hurt a great
■ .eal and the rest of the squad's height lies with Bill Stevenson, Gary And
'ews, ynd Dave Epperson all second stringers. The lack of backboard con
trol could be the weak link, but if Ramstead maintains his pace we may
jit! 112 be fretting in vain.
RULE CHANGE LEADS TO 103-102 SCORE
Pei haps the biggest shock of the winter recess was hearing that Stanford
whipped lowa State 1 OH-102 back at the Big Seven Tourney. We knew that
the Cards were a high scoring outfit but it was beyond us that any two
cams could couple up to produce 205 counters in a single game. So we
checked, and sure enough there was a slight rule alteration carried out in
the consolation tilts which accounts for such doings.
It went like this. When a team was fouled, it had no choice as whether
In shoot (he free throw or to take the ball out of bounds. It had to shoot
the attempt. If the shot was missed the ball was in play. However, and
here comes tin* reason for the high score, if the free throw was made the
team that shot it was gven the ball out of bounds under the offensive
basket, enabling them to set up a scoring play immediately. And it was
Stanford who made good use of this change, for the Cards were trailing
by six points with only a minute to go, but tied the game at fl7 all at the
end of regulation time and went on to win in the overtime.
CARD FENCERS MEET BEARS IN "BIG DUEL"
We imagine many will be heading towards Berkeley Saturday to take
in the Bear-Indian fracas that night. It also happens that Saturday, Stan
ford's fencers take on the California swordsmen in the Berkeley gym at 2:30.
If you have never seen a tencing meet, and we don't suppose many have,
this Saturday offers you a good chance to take in some fencing, that chival
rous sport, in the afternoon, and catch the ball game at night. We peeked
at the "Big Duel" last winter and we left thinking that Cyrano isn't the
only gent that can handle a foil.
In fact this could !)e Stanford's year in the world of fencing. At least the
local world. The Indian fencers have a golden opportunity to whip the
Bears for the first time since 1941. The fortunes of Stanford will be carried
n the good right and left arms respectively of Richard Gross and Ralph
Ainado. Gross is first man on the Injun squad of five. And it is Dick who
is ranked third in Northern California. Diminutive Amado, who isn't much
taller than his foil is long, ranks fifth in Northern California. Earl Schmitt,
Warren Finley, and Kirk MacNulty round out the quintet.
AFTERTHOUGHT: While speaking to a friend (?) the other day, he
reminded us of our predictions that Stanford would whip both California
and Illinois. We bowed humbly. Rut our friend (?) not satisfied with our
atlmisson of error, rudely suggested that we call our column Amateur
and Calm.
Oh. this cruel, cruel world.

rous sport, in the afternoon, and catch the ball game at night. We peeked
at the "Big Duel" last winter and we left thinking that Cyrano isn't the
only gent that can handle a foil.
In fact this could !)e Stanford's year in the world of fencing. At least the
local world. The Indian fencers have a golden opportunity to whip the
Bears for the first time since 1941. The fortunes of Stanford will be carried
n the good right and left arms respectively of Richard Gross and Ralph
Ainado. Gross is first man on the Injun squad of five. And it is Dick who
is ranked third in Northern California. Diminutive Amado, who isn't much
taller than his foil is long, ranks fifth in Northern California. Earl Schmitt,
Warren Finley, and Kirk MacNulty round out the quintet.
AFTERTHOUGHT: While speaking to a friend (?) the other day, he
reminded us of our predictions that Stanford would whip both California
and Illinois. We bowed humbly. Rut our friend (?) not satisfied with our
atlmisson of error, rudely suggested that we call our column Amateur
and Calm.
Oh. this cruel, cruel world.
Although (lit' Pacific Coast Conference standings don't prove it, we
see Stanford as now having an edge in the PCC southern division basket
ball race.
The .southern circuit, so the records show, is knotted with each of the
lour entries having dropped a game while winning a game. The important
iact is that Stanford has been on the road and has come home with a split
in two games with UCLA in the Bruins' home gym at Westwood. To beat
the Bruins in their small, overheated, highly partisan gym is a feat in itself.
Why, in two plus seasons the Uclans, three-time straight Southern Division
champs, have only lost three games at Westwood including the recent loss
to Stanford.
While Stanford and UCLA were mixing it up, USC and California were
Knocking themselves out earning a divide. This leads us to believe that
cither the Bears are stronger than their pre-season record showed, or that
ihe Trojans are a little poorer than doped out to be.
Itut at the moment the point of discussion is that the Indians don't
have to play in Westwood again this year. We meet the Bruins at home
in two games, Feb. It; and 17. We can he mighty tough at home. True,
Stanford does meet both Cal and SC away in two games apiece but they
will be picnics when contrasted to invading Uclan-land.
REBOUND WEAKNESS MAY PROVE CAGE DOWNFALL
We feel that the one thing that may hamper the Cards' cage chances this
season is lack of backboard strength. Currently Jim Ramstead is the boy
who has been collecting most of the rebounds. Olie SuzdalefT, Ron Tomsic,
and Fid Tucker are a bit too small to do too much on the boards, although
their all-round play more than compensates for this seeming weakness.
Jim Walsh does his reboundng share.
The loss of (i' 4" Don Carlson, through academic deficencies, hurt a great
■ .eal and the rest of the squad's height lies with Bill Stevenson, Gary And
'ews, ynd Dave Epperson all second stringers. The lack of backboard con
trol could be the weak link, but if Ramstead maintains his pace we may
jit! 112 be fretting in vain.
RULE CHANGE LEADS TO 103-102 SCORE
Pei haps the biggest shock of the winter recess was hearing that Stanford
whipped lowa State 1 OH-102 back at the Big Seven Tourney. We knew that
the Cards were a high scoring outfit but it was beyond us that any two
cams could couple up to produce 205 counters in a single game. So we
checked, and sure enough there was a slight rule alteration carried out in
the consolation tilts which accounts for such doings.
It went like this. When a team was fouled, it had no choice as whether
In shoot (he free throw or to take the ball out of bounds. It had to shoot
the attempt. If the shot was missed the ball was in play. However, and
here comes tin* reason for the high score, if the free throw was made the
team that shot it was gven the ball out of bounds under the offensive
basket, enabling them to set up a scoring play immediately. And it was
Stanford who made good use of this change, for the Cards were trailing
by six points with only a minute to go, but tied the game at fl7 all at the
end of regulation time and went on to win in the overtime.
CARD FENCERS MEET BEARS IN "BIG DUEL"
We imagine many will be heading towards Berkeley Saturday to take
in the Bear-Indian fracas that night. It also happens that Saturday, Stan
ford's fencers take on the California swordsmen in the Berkeley gym at 2:30.

checked, and sure enough there was a slight rule alteration carried out in
the consolation tilts which accounts for such doings.
It went like this. When a team was fouled, it had no choice as whether
In shoot (he free throw or to take the ball out of bounds. It had to shoot
the attempt. If the shot was missed the ball was in play. However, and
here comes tin* reason for the high score, if the free throw was made the
team that shot it was gven the ball out of bounds under the offensive
basket, enabling them to set up a scoring play immediately. And it was
Stanford who made good use of this change, for the Cards were trailing
by six points with only a minute to go, but tied the game at fl7 all at the
end of regulation time and went on to win in the overtime.
CARD FENCERS MEET BEARS IN "BIG DUEL"
We imagine many will be heading towards Berkeley Saturday to take
in the Bear-Indian fracas that night. It also happens that Saturday, Stan
ford's fencers take on the California swordsmen in the Berkeley gym at 2:30.
If you have never seen a tencing meet, and we don't suppose many have,
this Saturday offers you a good chance to take in some fencing, that chival
rous sport, in the afternoon, and catch the ball game at night. We peeked
at the "Big Duel" last winter and we left thinking that Cyrano isn't the
only gent that can handle a foil.
In fact this could !)e Stanford's year in the world of fencing. At least the
local world. The Indian fencers have a golden opportunity to whip the
Bears for the first time since 1941. The fortunes of Stanford will be carried
n the good right and left arms respectively of Richard Gross and Ralph
Ainado. Gross is first man on the Injun squad of five. And it is Dick who
is ranked third in Northern California. Diminutive Amado, who isn't much
taller than his foil is long, ranks fifth in Northern California. Earl Schmitt,
Warren Finley, and Kirk MacNulty round out the quintet.
AFTERTHOUGHT: While speaking to a friend (?) the other day, he
reminded us of our predictions that Stanford would whip both California
and Illinois. We bowed humbly. Rut our friend (?) not satisfied with our
atlmisson of error, rudely suggested that we call our column Amateur
and Calm.
Oh. this cruel, cruel world.
Although (lit' Pacific Coast Conference standings don't prove it, we
see Stanford as now having an edge in the PCC southern division basket
ball race.
The .southern circuit, so the records show, is knotted with each of the
lour entries having dropped a game while winning a game. The important
iact is that Stanford has been on the road and has come home with a split
in two games with UCLA in the Bruins' home gym at Westwood. To beat
the Bruins in their small, overheated, highly partisan gym is a feat in itself.
Why, in two plus seasons the Uclans, three-time straight Southern Division
champs, have only lost three games at Westwood including the recent loss
to Stanford.
While Stanford and UCLA were mixing it up, USC and California were
Knocking themselves out earning a divide. This leads us to believe that
cither the Bears are stronger than their pre-season record showed, or that
ihe Trojans are a little poorer than doped out to be.
Itut at the moment the point of discussion is that the Indians don't
have to play in Westwood again this year. We meet the Bruins at home
in two games, Feb. It; and 17. We can he mighty tough at home. True,
Stanford does meet both Cal and SC away in two games apiece but they
will be picnics when contrasted to invading Uclan-land.
REBOUND WEAKNESS MAY PROVE CAGE DOWNFALL
We feel that the one thing that may hamper the Cards' cage chances this
season is lack of backboard strength. Currently Jim Ramstead is the boy
who has been collecting most of the rebounds. Olie SuzdalefT, Ron Tomsic,
and Fid Tucker are a bit too small to do too much on the boards, although
their all-round play more than compensates for this seeming weakness.
Jim Walsh does his reboundng share.
The loss of (i' 4" Don Carlson, through academic deficencies, hurt a great
■ .eal and the rest of the squad's height lies with Bill Stevenson, Gary And
'ews, ynd Dave Epperson all second stringers. The lack of backboard con
trol could be the weak link, but if Ramstead maintains his pace we may
jit! 112 be fretting in vain.
RULE CHANGE LEADS TO 103-102 SCORE
Pei haps the biggest shock of the winter recess was hearing that Stanford
whipped lowa State 1 OH-102 back at the Big Seven Tourney. We knew that
the Cards were a high scoring outfit but it was beyond us that any two
