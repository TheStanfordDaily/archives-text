# WILLIAMS DRAFTED
## Bosox Lose Top Slugger 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP) —
Ted Williams, premier slugging star
ol the Boston Red Sox, received a
"bolt out of the blue" call to ac
tive duty as a Marine flyer today in
a sudden announcement that found
him blissfully fishing in the Florida
keys.
Williams must report early in
May, which will give him little or
no time in which to help the Red
Sox in the 1952 pennant race.
He was the most prominent ath
lete called to the colors since the
outbreak of the Korean war — the
highest salaried player in baseball
at $89,000 and the only active major
league slugger ever to hit better
than .400 in a single season.
