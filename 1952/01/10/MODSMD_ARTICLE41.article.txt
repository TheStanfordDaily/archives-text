# Aussie Discus Ace Injured
## 
### 
Lan Reed, ace Indian discus
thrower, lost what seemed an al
most certain place on the Olympic
Games team Sunday when he broke
two toes in the Stanford gym.
The Australian athlete was play
ing with friends in a friendly game
of basketball when he fell. i-Ie will
be sidelined for two months, which
makes it impossible for him to rep
resent Australia as he had planned.
The athletes in the land down
| under are currently holding tryouts
i to find the best representatives in
j each sport. Rules permit that each
j entrant may try out in any part of
I the world he happens to be, pro
viding he is from Australia. Reed
was planning to try out soon on
the Stanford field, under AAU su
j pervision.
