# ‘No Plan' on Puddles
## 
### 
Officials of Stanford's Building
and Ground department advised
yesterday that "no plan is being
proposed" to erase the "sad
problem" caused by winter rains
which water choke the campus
drainage system and flood the
streets.
Following last week's rains which
swamped the drainage facilities,
many students complained that the
water-slicked streets are a driving
hazard.
Maintenance chiefs of the Build
ings and Grounds Department said
yesterday they realized the hazard
but that little could be done to ease
the difficulty.
They said that lack of funds
was the main stumbling block to .
improvement.
Much of the water could be
cleared from the streets, Carl Mey-

er, Assistant Superintendent of
Buildings and Grounds, elaimcd, if
a sufficient labor force were avail
able to keep drains clear. He said
that often drains become leaf
clogged, damming water back into
the streets.
Meyer reported that five days
a week a force of two or three
men are usually assigned the task
of drain clearance. The workers,
however, do not work on week
ends.
It was last weekend when near
flood conditions were noted along
some of Stanford's streets. The in
tersection of Lagunita Drive and
Santa Teresa Street behind the Post
Office was coated by an inch-deep
puddle which forced cars to a snail's
crawl.
That water which does pour into
the drainage system gushes into the
sunken gardens at the head of Palm
Drive and into the field behind the
new Eating Club Building.
