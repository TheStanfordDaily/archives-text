# Folk Dance Club Leads â€˜Active' Life
## 
### SARA PACKARD 
"Active and enthusiastic" best de
scribes the Hoedowners, square and
folk dance organization, whose
membership list of 50 constitutes
one of the largest campus groups.
"Fun, fellowship, and recreation"
is the Hoedowner motto when both
experts and beginners congregate at
7:30 p.m. each Thursday in the
Women's Gym. Everything from
schottisches and two-steps to va
rieties of foreign dance pageantries
is covered during the evening's
course.
Many countries are represented
in the Hoedowner costume ward
robe which is reserved for exhi
bitions and special occasions. The
traditional Hoedowner garb, con
sisting of maroon satin shirts,
white tics, and dark pants for the
boys, and long peasant type West
ern apparel for the girls, is the
group's most renowned feature.
Although this dancing club has
performed at such festivities as the
Village open house and the United
Nations Week program during fall
quarter, spring will be its busiest
time. The coming schedule includes
the Northern California Folk
Dance Federation convention in
Oakland, a costumed exhibition at
the Women's Clubhouse, and a spe
cial spring program. In past years
the Hoedowners have performed in
the Tuesday Evening Series.
According to Alan Wilniunder,
president, new members are al
ways welcome. Beginners and
lower division students are need
ed to form a nucleus for later
seasons.
Hoedowner instructors include
Miss Miriam Lidster, faculty ad
viser, and student board members.

officers are Gay Dickson, vice-pres
ident; Joan Steindorf, secretary
treasurer; Cynthia Shephard, cos
