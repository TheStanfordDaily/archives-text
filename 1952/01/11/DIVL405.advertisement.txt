" CONFERENCE IN THE CLOUDS
Among the undergraduates on any college campus, you'll find
the talk reaching up to the clouds. And once in a while — in a class
room, around a study table, or even in a bull session —a really big
idea is born.
Big ideas come, too, from the men and women in laboratories,
business offices, shops. But often these professionals are exploring
a path first glimpsed in college.
How do we know? Because ol the many college people who
have come into the Bell System, where big ideas and a lot of dreams
have taken their place in progress. 1 he human voice, carried along
a wire, first across a town, then a state, a nation, and now the world.
Music and pictures and things happening delivered into cities and
hamlets all across the land by radio and television networks.
We're always looking for the men and women who get big
ideas —whether they're about people, or machines, or ways of doing
things. It's the only way the Bell System can keep on giving this
country the best telephone service in the world.
