## Captain Carlsen Loses 'Enterprise' 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 10 (UP)—The
"Captain Courageous" of the bat
terer! American freighter "Flying
Enterprise" jumped from his vessel
just as it slipped beneath the waves
early today.
The heroic Wood bridge, N.J.,
skipper, Kurt Carlsen, who had
sworn to bring the disabled vessel
into port or ride her until she sank,
clung to the listing, battered hulk
until the* pounding waves licked at
his feet on the side of her half-sub
merged funnel.
Me waited until death was cer
tain if he delayed a moment longer.
Then he jumped, with British
teaman Kenneth Dancy—conceding
defeat in his epic 15 - day battle
against the elements.
The poised and waiting British
tug Turmoil bore down on the two
bobbing figures and scooped them
up from the icy Channel waters less
than five minutes after they aban
doned ship.
Seconds later the stricken freight
er rolled over completely.
