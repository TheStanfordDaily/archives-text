# Full-Scale Rushing Begins in Earnest
## 
### 
Fraternity rushing goes into the
last phase of its open house program
tonight with the entire row of 24
houses open from 7:15 to 9:15.
The seven eating clubs will join the
fraternities in also holding their final
open house tonight from 7:30 until
10:00.
At the close of the evening's open
houses, the wraps will come off rush
ing activities, and the period of for
mal open rushing will begin. It will

last through the preferential dinners
and pledge card signing on Jan. 21.
At any time during the period of
open rushing a house may pledge a
rushec informally by offering him a
pledge pin and gaining acceptance.
However, no pledge will become
binding until the pledge card is
finally signed, and at any time pre
vious a man may break a pledge
merely by returning the pin.
After the pledge card has been
signed, a man may break a pledge
without penalty only upon agree
ment with the fraternity concerned.
Otherwise, he may not pledge an
other house until the second succeed
ing quarter following his depledging.
For this reason, and to keep "pledge
stealing" to a minimum, Interfra
ternity Council President Tony Gar

rett cautioncd rushees against accept
ing a pin until they are certain of
the house they want to join.
In the meantime Interclub Council
President Al Sieroty emphasized
once again the informal nature of
Eating Club affiliation procedure. All
a man has to do to join an eating club
is to indicate the acceptance of an
invitation by the club. There is no
formal pledge card signing.
The eating clubs have been en
gaged in open rushing with a series
of invitation lunches and dinners and
other engagements going on since
last Tuesday.
Much the same will be the program
of the fraternities. Parties and out
ings are scheduled for this weekend,
and luncheons and dinners and other
gatherings for next week.
