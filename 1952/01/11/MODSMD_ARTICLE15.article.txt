# Point Happy Indians, Bears Tangle Tonight
## Traditional Rivals Clash in Local Gym 
### DICK KLEIN 
Alter a long lay-off from the
local hardwood, the point-happy
Indian quintet returns to the Pa
vilion tonight to meet their tra
ditional rivals, the California
Bears. Tip-off is set for 8 p.m.
The same two teams meet again
tomorrow night in the Berkeley
Men's Gym at an 8:30 starting
time.
Stanford began their bid for the
Southern Division title sporting a ten
and one record. After a split with
the Bruins in their Westwood sweat
box the Indians arc in a four-way tie
for first and last place in the Pacific-
Coast race. The Bears managed a
similar split with the Trojans.
The Card attack seems to have
finally jelled into a really speed
burning and big-point producing
outfit. Stalwarts are the three
seniors—Eddie Tucker, Jim Ram
stead, and Jimmy Walsh. Continu
ing to show his class and All-divi
sion center style of play, Captain
Rammer leads the team in scoring
with a neat 15.6 average. More im
portant, he has been consistently
the best man in the vital rebound
department.
Tucker, who came to Stanford as a
junior transfer forward last year from
Compton, and immediately earned the
respect of the Card rooters with his
terrific all-around game and ability
to make points in the clutch, is doing

it again. Last weekend, Eddie pulled
the second UCLA game right out of
the fire with a stolen ball, lay-up, and
freethrow in the last minute of play.
He is close behind Rarnstead in scoi
ing with a 15.4 average in 13 games.
Playing his third year as a Var
sity starter, Jim Walsh has been
supplying the pepper and drive for
the ballcluh. He has been a key
point on defense and sharp on re
hounds. With a little boost in hi .
scoring, Jim will strengthen the In
dians greatly.
Two newcomers break into the first
five since most Farm supporters la: I
saw the Varsity play ball. Olie Suz
dalefT, sparkplug of last year's sen
sational freshman team, fits in at onr
guard post. Little Olie, only 5' 11",
took away the starting berth from
Paul Johnson, who has been out with
jaundice but is now on the mend. A
capable scorer and excellent play
maker, Suzdaleff has the speed to lit,
into the fast-breaking Stanford line
up.
Another shortic is frosh forward,
Ron Tomsic, star of Fremont High
in Oakland for three straight years.
A good firing partner for Tucker,
this combination gives the Indians
the highest scoring forward duo in
the conference.
The insertion of Tomsic and Suz
dalefT into the starting five has cre
ated a little problem in the height
department and as a result has caused
a big deficiency in grabbing off re
bounds. Coach Bob Burnett, in an
