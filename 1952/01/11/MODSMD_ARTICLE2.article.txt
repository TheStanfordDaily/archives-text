WASHINGTON â€” President Tru
man today placed the administra
tion's promised clean-up of govern
ment corruption in the hands of At
torney General J. Howard McGrath,
whose own department figured in
the tax scandal investigation.
The President thus squelched ru
mors that McGrath soon would re
sign or be kicked out of office. He
said he has dropped all plans for a
special clean-up commission and
that the Attorney General will han
dle the job instead.
