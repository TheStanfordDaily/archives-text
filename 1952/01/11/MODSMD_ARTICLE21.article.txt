# The 						Job of Public Exercises
## 
### 
As the clearing house for all public meetings
on campus, the Public Exercises Committee
performs a function important to every mem
ber of the University.
The weekly calendar of eventE put out by
the committee is evidence of the variety and
number of activities under its scope. The com
mittee sponsors such events as the Tuesday
Evening Series, and the appearance of the San
Francisco Symphony on campus. Any other
gathering which is thrown open to the public
is either directly or indirectly under its juris
diction. The Sunday Evening movies, for ex
ample, are handled directly by the students,
and Little Theatre and Mem Aud productions
by the Speech and Drama department, but it
is the Public Exercises Committee which has
the last word, if necessary, on any of these ac
tivities.
With the numerous events occurring on cam
pus, a committee such as this is indispensable
in arranging times and meeting places, so that
activities will not conflict.
In selecting speakers for public lectures or
in sponsoring various cultural gatherings, the
Public Exercises Committee considers the in

terests of many members of the Stanford family
and the community. But what part student in
terest plays in planning these activities is gues
tionable when there is no student representa
tion on the committee.
The committee is and has always been com
posed of faculty members exclusively. It func
tions as one of the adrninstrative committees
under the president of the University, and its
members are appointed by him.
As one of several faculty committees tradition
might seem to stand in the way of any kind of
student representation on the Public Exercises
Committee, hut the particular lunction of this
committee in sponsoring public meetings at
Stanford certainly involves student interest and
student participation. It would seem desirable,
both for the committee and the student body,
to have some actual link between them.
Whether this link would take the form of a
student member of the committee, serving in
an ex-officio status, or an advisory committee
from Excorn woiking with the faculty board, the
Public Exercises Committee would be better in
formed of what student audiences are interested
in. And the student body would be sure that
their interests were being represented.â€”S.G.
