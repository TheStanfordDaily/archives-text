# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
FRIDAY MORNING JOTTINGS
One evening near the end of Autumn quarter I
dropped over to Muison Fran<jaise. It was the evening
of the Ezzard Charles-Joey Maxim fight, and appar
ently nine or ten ot the Maison Frangaise dwellers
(none of whom had a French accent) had noticed the
various weight, length, and bicep measurements in

that morning's Chronicle.
This fascinated them, and they
were all in a line, taking turns at
subjecting their flabby biceps to
the tape measure.
"Hey, mine's eight inches," ex
claimed one.
"That's nothin', mine is nine,"
boasted another.
"Ha 1 Mine is lO 1 /^
"That's 'cause vou lift cows all
the time."
In unjournalistic fashion, I

slipped out before the biceps argument led to some
one's TKO in the seventh.

MOST PERPLEXED MAN ON CAMPUS DEPT.
If you see a fellow on campus with a drawn face,
blood-shot eyes, and quivering white lips, it's Barry
Smith, editor of the Quail. Bany is a man possessed
with a problem. At the beginning of the football
season, he optimistically reserved four full pages for

the Rose Bowl game and drooled with glee when the
Indians received the hid. Barry's dream of four
action-filled pages of a Stanford victory turned into
a nightmare with the 40 to 7 fiasco.
The pledges up at the Phi Sig house have been
keeping a 24-hour watch, lest Barry make some rash
attempt on his life.

TIP FOR TIIOSF. INVOLVED IN RUSHING DEPT.
Those going through the rushing program are faced
with the eternal problems ol remembering every Tom,
Dick, and Throckmorton's name. This is easily solved.
When you meet a fraternity or eating club man for
the second time and you don't remember his name,
the thing to do is suddenly develop a twitcli around
your mouth. You are able to say the salutation, but
when you get to ids name you must of course rub
your hand in front of your mouth to gel rid of the
twitch. This results in an incoherent mumble, and
he thinks you know bis name all the time. It sounds
something like this, " I Well, how are you, inmmfffff?"

POEM FOR TODAY DEPT.
There once was a Ph.D.
Who lectured at five after three.
TTis clothes were a shock,
Not drab was his frock,
Hut his lectures were dull as could be
