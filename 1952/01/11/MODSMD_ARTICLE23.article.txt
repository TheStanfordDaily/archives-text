# BRITISH, STANFORD EDUCATION COMPARED
## 'Fagging,' 'Pop,' and 'Dry Bobs' Form Important Part of Life at Eton College 
### DAVID SEELEY 
(David Seeley, a Stanford freshman, spcnl four
years at Eton's equivalent of the American high
school. Below ho Rives some of his impressions, and
contracts them with education at Stanford.)

My first week at Eton College was very different than
the one I had at Stanford. In England a very formal
atmosphere pervades in all educational institutions.
The first day there ( was welcomed by my house
master, a very learned looking gentleman, who told
me about the tnpal arrangements and that 1 would
begin my fagging in two weeks time. Fagging is a
system devised by the British public schools to keep
the freshmen in their place for the first two years yon
clean rooms and run errands for seniors.
I should explain right now that as soon as we arrived
at school we had to don the ttaditional top hats and
tails, but during my time there a slight alteration was
made in that rule: top hats became optional.
Other traditions I soon learned about was the system
of government in the school. In each house, and there
are 26 of them, there is a group ol older students who
are responsible for discipline. An example of a pun
ishable offense might be a casual, good natured fight.
The punishment for such a misdemeanor is a sound
caning
The responsibility of governing the whole school
is entru r ted to the Head Master antl to a special
body of self-elected men called "Pop," or the Eton
Society. In number the pops are about 2!» to :JO, and
considering that the total enrollment teaches almost
I,2(M> t!»is is really a very small minoiity. To be
Hei t«'d to this honorary society a student must rate
well in his class, as well as have several athletic
distinctions to his name; and then too he must possess
a charactei that is likeable and Pennine.

My first indoctrination in sports was in the time
honored Field Game, which is playpd only at Eton.
This limits the competition mostly to intra-mural
gamer, and scratches (teams made up of just any play
ers), but nevertheless it is fascinating to play and
watch. Each house fields three teams of eleven mem
ber.': each, and there is keen competition in all of the
leaguer,. Other sports in the winter include fives
(handball), squash, nigger, soccer, boxing, and fenc
ing.
liul as soon as (lie spring quarter comes around the
whole school is divided into two athletic camps, the
"wet hobs" and the "dry bobs." Half the school rows
(the "ivel bobs") while the other half plays cricket.
I'ci Ihe dry bobs llie climax of their season is when
they meet llanow at Lords in l.ondon, and (he long
awaited testing f.iound lor Ihe Eight is at the Hen
ley Regatta.
Of course the most important aspect of any school
is its academic life. At Eton there is nothing but pre
scribed courses loi the first, two years. These con
sisted ol Latin, French, Mathematics, and history, with
Greek optional; and they were definitely hard going
for an American with hardly any foundation in Ihe
dead languages. There is nothing like being able to
pick many of your own courses, as we do here, though
there are some requirements.
What w.i Ihe effect ol my four years in England?
Ii .111 say that my outlook bioadened perceptively with
a • ioc iation with my fellow English students; I got some
idea of England geographically, socially, and politi
i .illy, and I have made some lasting friendships there
Must ol .ill I have learned to appreciate the English
people foi what they are, and I think that we all must
do this ►! w*' aie evei to achieve a lasting alliance,
and what i: more important jri enduring peace.

My first week at Eton College was very different than
the one I had at Stanford. In England a very formal
atmosphere pervades in all educational institutions.
The first day there ( was welcomed by my house
master, a very learned looking gentleman, who told
me about the tnpal arrangements and that 1 would
begin my fagging in two weeks time. Fagging is a
system devised by the British public schools to keep
the freshmen in their place for the first two years yon
clean rooms and run errands for seniors.
I should explain right now that as soon as we arrived
at school we had to don the ttaditional top hats and
tails, but during my time there a slight alteration was
made in that rule: top hats became optional.
Other traditions I soon learned about was the system
of government in the school. In each house, and there
are 26 of them, there is a group ol older students who
are responsible for discipline. An example of a pun
ishable offense might be a casual, good natured fight.
The punishment for such a misdemeanor is a sound
caning
The responsibility of governing the whole school
is entru r ted to the Head Master antl to a special
body of self-elected men called "Pop," or the Eton
Society. In number the pops are about 2!» to :JO, and
considering that the total enrollment teaches almost
I,2(M> t!»is is really a very small minoiity. To be
Hei t«'d to this honorary society a student must rate
well in his class, as well as have several athletic
distinctions to his name; and then too he must possess
a charactei that is likeable and Pennine.

My first indoctrination in sports was in the time
honored Field Game, which is playpd only at Eton.
This limits the competition mostly to intra-mural
gamer, and scratches (teams made up of just any play
ers), but nevertheless it is fascinating to play and
watch. Each house fields three teams of eleven mem
ber.': each, and there is keen competition in all of the
leaguer,. Other sports in the winter include fives
