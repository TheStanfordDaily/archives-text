# Korean Stalemate
## 
### 
TOKYO, Friday, Jan. 11â€”The
Korean truce talks entered their
second half-year today deadlocked
on the two major issues of how an
armistice should be supervised and
how prisoners of war should be ex
changed.
The Communists still insisted on
the right to build and repair air
fields during an armistice and the
Allies were dead set against it.
The Allies insist that Communist
war prisoners hold by the UN be
given an opportunity to say whether
they want to go back to Communist
North Korea and the Reds have re
jected the proopsal.
