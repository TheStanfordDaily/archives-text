On Dec. 16, the following item
appeared in Art Rosenbaum's col
umn, "Overheard," in the San Fran
cj:.co Chronicle:
"On the campus at Stanford, so
it's heard, is <i young man named
lIARLAN STROUD, lie was All-
Metropolitan in the New York
area for three vears at Horace
Mann High. He is (> ft. 7 in. up
and weighs 2(>() pounds, and is a
young man of whom you will hear
in the future. So reports PAUL
ZIMMERMAN, a Stanford stu
dent who also gridded in the same
high school."
Many people here on campus
have been calling the Chronicle, the
Palo Alto Times, and even The
Daily in regard to this fabulous
iM'idder. From those who seem to
know something about the matter,
we gather that the Chronicle made
a gross error* and placed Stroud
already on the campus. From our
source we learned that he is merely
contemplating coming to the Farm
and if so he is slated to arrive next
fall.
Furthermore Stroud does not
play tackle, as would be expected,
but he is a fullback who runs the
hundred in under 11 seconds and
can pas;: the ball over 70 yards. On
defense he is somewhat of a Mc-
Coll, as he can play tackle, end,
linebacker, halfback, and has even
played safety.
There is a possibility, however,

that the whole story is merely a
fabrication. II so, it would be some
thing similar to a famous hoax per
petrated on the New York news
papers some years back.
It seems that a group of stock
brokers, as a practical joke, decided
to invent a football team and wire
its weekly scores to the New York
papers. They called the team Plain
field (New Jersey) Teachers and
the big star was supposed to be one
Jackie Chang, a Chinese triple
threater.
The New York papers fell for
the story, hook, line, and sinker.
They printed the scores, week by
week, as wired and occasionally,
even printed a little about the ex
ploits of the fabulous Chang.
The final game of the season
drew near and Plainfield was still
undefeated. Worcester State, their
arch-rival, was to he the final op
ponent, and by this time the pa
pers were really becoming in
terested. Finally a reporter was
sent out to interview the coach
and, of course, Jie couldn't find
one, or even a school.
The next day a frantic telegram
came over the wires. It said that
Chang and the rest of the squad
had flunked out of school, football
had been dropped, and because of
lack of sufficient funds, the school
had folded. That was the last that
was ever heard of Plainfield Teach
ers. What is Harlan Stroud?

high school."
Many people here on campus
have been calling the Chronicle, the
Palo Alto Times, and even The
Daily in regard to this fabulous
iM'idder. From those who seem to
know something about the matter,
we gather that the Chronicle made
a gross error* and placed Stroud
already on the campus. From our
source we learned that he is merely
contemplating coming to the Farm
and if so he is slated to arrive next
fall.
Furthermore Stroud does not
play tackle, as would be expected,
but he is a fullback who runs the
hundred in under 11 seconds and
can pas;: the ball over 70 yards. On
defense he is somewhat of a Mc-
Coll, as he can play tackle, end,
linebacker, halfback, and has even
played safety.
There is a possibility, however,

that the whole story is merely a
fabrication. II so, it would be some
thing similar to a famous hoax per
petrated on the New York news
papers some years back.
It seems that a group of stock
brokers, as a practical joke, decided
to invent a football team and wire
its weekly scores to the New York
papers. They called the team Plain
field (New Jersey) Teachers and
the big star was supposed to be one
Jackie Chang, a Chinese triple
threater.
The New York papers fell for
the story, hook, line, and sinker.
They printed the scores, week by
week, as wired and occasionally,
even printed a little about the ex
ploits of the fabulous Chang.
The final game of the season
drew near and Plainfield was still
undefeated. Worcester State, their
arch-rival, was to he the final op
ponent, and by this time the pa
pers were really becoming in
terested. Finally a reporter was
sent out to interview the coach
and, of course, Jie couldn't find
one, or even a school.
The next day a frantic telegram
came over the wires. It said that
Chang and the rest of the squad
had flunked out of school, football
had been dropped, and because of
lack of sufficient funds, the school
had folded. That was the last that
was ever heard of Plainfield Teach
ers. What is Harlan Stroud?

"On the campus at Stanford, so
it's heard, is <i young man named
lIARLAN STROUD, lie was All-
Metropolitan in the New York
area for three vears at Horace
Mann High. He is (> ft. 7 in. up
and weighs 2(>() pounds, and is a
young man of whom you will hear
in the future. So reports PAUL
ZIMMERMAN, a Stanford stu
dent who also gridded in the same
high school."
