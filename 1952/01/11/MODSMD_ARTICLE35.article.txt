# Braves Play California Too
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
The Stanford JV's will meet the
powerful Cal Ramblers as a pre
liminary to the varsity games to
night and tomorrow. The Braves
boast an unimpressive three won,
three lost record; however, their
three losses have been by only two
points apiece.
This is the first time that the
hoys have faced college opposi
tion, and in practice, at least, they
appear to have regained their
timing and their eye after the two
week Christmas lay-off.
Coach Gus Chavalas has got his
boys running from the openihg
whistle, and this fast break coupled
with a light, aggressive defense re

sults in colorful, though sometims
erratic, basketball.
The Cal team will have the ad
vantage of experience on the Cards.
It's not certain whom they'll bring
down from the varsity for the con
test; however, the elephantine Clay
Gray will probably be playing cen
ter for the Bears. Gray played great
ball as a frosh two years ago for
Cal, but sickness has wrecked what
would otherwise have been a great
college career. He still has enough
to give Stanford a hard time this
weekend.
Stanford will field a green hut
hustling team. Forward Russ
Lawler and center John Ramsey
give the team backboard-control
l.ing height, while diminutive
guards Wayne Lockhart and
George Karras spark the charges
down court. Dick Carver, a fine
scoring threat, plays the other
forward position. Eric Wittenberg,
Jim WestphaJ, Jim Johnson, and
Howard Schwartz give the team
good reserve strength. The one
hig hind is that of the above nine
players, eight of them are frosh
and Karras is a soph. This inex
perience may cost the team a few
more games before they round
into shape.
