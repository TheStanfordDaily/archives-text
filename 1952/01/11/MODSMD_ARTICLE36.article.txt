# Tomsic May Topple PCC Point Mark
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Ron Tomsic, Stanford sharpshoot
ing freshman forward, stands a good
chance of breaking the All-Time Pa
cific Coast Conference scoring rec
ord, during his collegiate career. The
record is now held by Oregon State's
former All-American, Red Rocha,
who scored G34 points in three con
ference seasons.
Tomsic has the advantage of being
able to compete for four seasons, and
he will probably be first string for
at least three years. He has scored
21 points in two conference games so
far, for a 10.5 average. If he con
tinues at this pace for the remainder
of this season, and then proceeds to
average 14.2 for the rest of his var
sity career, he will have the record
broken.
Oleg Suzdaleff, only a soph, also lias
a chance for the record. He is aver
aging 10.5 per game, but oidy has
two seasons left.
