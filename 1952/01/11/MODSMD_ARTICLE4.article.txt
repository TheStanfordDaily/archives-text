CINCINNATI, Jan. 10—The NC
AA's policy-making council today
heard chiefs of the American Coun
cil of Education describe a plan
which would sec college presidents
take over control of athletics in a
move that could virtually super
sede all NCAA powers.
The educators said that under
such a set-up, the NCAA—National
Collegiate Athletic Association —
would continue to handle "the rules
for all types of athletics" as a "nec
essary function."
However, it was clear that this
plan would make the NCAA merely
the secondary governing body of
college sports.
Also, a preliminary hearing on
television producd a recommenda
tion for continued control over TV
in 1952.
