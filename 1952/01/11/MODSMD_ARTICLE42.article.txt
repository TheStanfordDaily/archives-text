# Epstein Says Farm Fame High Abroad
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
"Stanford has the best pos
sible reputation abroad" was the
enthusiastic report of Dr. Fritz
Epstein, curator of the Hoover
Institutes' Central and Eastern
European Collections, who re
turned recently after a leave of
absence.

In Europe in November on gov
ernment assignment, Dr. Epstein
was particularly struck with the
impression Stanford Exchange Stu
dent Phil Nielsen is making at the
Free University of Berlin. "You
couldn't imagine a better represen
tative of Stanford," the professor
declared.
In Berlin Stanford as a whole is
known about and liked, too. "Stan
ford has done wonderful work in

relief, book, and other drives . . .
and all that has been done is deeply
appreciated," he said.
Kind Words
Dr. Epstein heard other kind
words about Stanford in London
and Amsterdam. Famed historian
Arnold Toynbee "thinks very af
fectionately" of Stanford after his
speaking visit here last year. Dr.
Louis de Jong, head of the Amster
dam Institute of War Documenta
tion, who was at the Hoover Insti
tute several years ago, is also
spreading good will for the Farm.
Dr. Epstein brought back an A
plus report on Phil Nielsen after
talking to the foreign scholar and
his associates at the Berlin univer
sity. "They all like him," the pro
fessor remarked about Nielsen, who
went to Germany this fall under the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Pro
gram.
Excellent Spot
As a political science major, Niel
sen is in an excellent position to ob
serve European political affairs, Dr.
Epstein pointed out. "It is hard to
think of a better observation point
for a political scientist than Berlin,"
frontier city and focal point for
East-West tensions, he explained.
Nielsen "has been speaking with
people in all walks of life," the pro
fessor reported. "I can only marvel
at his German," he said, and ex
plained that the foreign scholar had
studied the language at summer

c
school and had even refused to
speak English when he met him in
Berlin.
The excellent impression made by
such exchange students as Nielsen

"augurs well for future exchanges,"
Dr. Epstein predicted.
Fully Aware
The Hoover Institute worker em
phasized that Free University stu
dents were fully aware that aid had

been especially sent them by Stan
ford students, and that books and
clothes they received did not just
come from a general, impersonal
fund.
Personal contacts were the rea
son he gave for this awareness of
Stanford. He explained that many
Berliners were corresponding with
Farm students, and that the ex
change program was strengthening
the bonds.
Dr. Epstein has a personal inter
est in the Free University, since he
and his wife were well acquainted
with many of the men and women
who began the student - founded
school. The University is now flour
ishing, he reported. "It has done so
much for morale that the Ford
Foundation has given such a large
grant to improve physical condi
tions" was his comment on the $1,-
309,500 given the university this
fall.
Since Founding
Since its founding in 1048, the
Free University has built a (>,OOO
student enrollment and is currently
planning to expand into adult edu
cation. Dr. Epstein stressed the
school's importance to the students
from the Soviet Zone, who become
virtually political refugees when
they enroll. "It is the best cultural
investment which the Americans
have made in Germany since the
end of the war," he declared.

"Stanford has the best pos
sible reputation abroad" was the
enthusiastic report of Dr. Fritz
Epstein, curator of the Hoover
Institutes' Central and Eastern
European Collections, who re
turned recently after a leave of
absence.

In Europe in November on gov
ernment assignment, Dr. Epstein
was particularly struck with the
impression Stanford Exchange Stu
dent Phil Nielsen is making at the
Free University of Berlin. "You
couldn't imagine a better represen
tative of Stanford," the professor
declared.
In Berlin Stanford as a whole is
known about and liked, too. "Stan
ford has done wonderful work in

relief, book, and other drives . . .
and all that has been done is deeply
appreciated," he said.
Kind Words
Dr. Epstein heard other kind
words about Stanford in London
and Amsterdam. Famed historian
Arnold Toynbee "thinks very af
fectionately" of Stanford after his
speaking visit here last year. Dr.
Louis de Jong, head of the Amster
dam Institute of War Documenta
tion, who was at the Hoover Insti
tute several years ago, is also
spreading good will for the Farm.
Dr. Epstein brought back an A
plus report on Phil Nielsen after
talking to the foreign scholar and
his associates at the Berlin univer
sity. "They all like him," the pro
fessor remarked about Nielsen, who
went to Germany this fall under the
ASSU Foreign Scholarship Pro
gram.
Excellent Spot
As a political science major, Niel
sen is in an excellent position to ob
serve European political affairs, Dr.
Epstein pointed out. "It is hard to
think of a better observation point
for a political scientist than Berlin,"
frontier city and focal point for
East-West tensions, he explained.
Nielsen "has been speaking with
people in all walks of life," the pro
fessor reported. "I can only marvel
at his German," he said, and ex
plained that the foreign scholar had
studied the language at summer

c
school and had even refused to
speak English when he met him in
Berlin.
The excellent impression made by
such exchange students as Nielsen

"augurs well for future exchanges,"
Dr. Epstein predicted.
Fully Aware
The Hoover Institute worker em
phasized that Free University stu
dents were fully aware that aid had

been especially sent them by Stan
ford students, and that books and
clothes they received did not just
come from a general, impersonal
fund.
Personal contacts were the rea
son he gave for this awareness of
Stanford. He explained that many
Berliners were corresponding with
Farm students, and that the ex
change program was strengthening
the bonds.
Dr. Epstein has a personal inter
est in the Free University, since he
and his wife were well acquainted
with many of the men and women
who began the student - founded
school. The University is now flour
ishing, he reported. "It has done so
much for morale that the Ford
Foundation has given such a large
grant to improve physical condi
tions" was his comment on the $1,-
309,500 given the university this
fall.
