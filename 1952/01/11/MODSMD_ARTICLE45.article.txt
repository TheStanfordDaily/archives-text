### CONNIE GOMPERTS 
One of the many services of Stan
ford University Mothers' Club is
the maintenance of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes, which pro
vide medical care for students not
seriously enough ill to require hos
pitalization, but too ill to remain
at their residences.
Admittance is by the order of one
of the doctors who arc always on
call by the Rest Home directors.
The most common complaints of
students in the homes are colds in
the winter and early spring, and
poison oak in the summer and fall.
The two Rest Homes are under
the direction of the Stanford Health
Service, which has its office on cam
pus. The Service provides medical
care, and pays for the food, most of
the drugs, and the services of the
Rest Home directors and their as
sistants. The Mothers' Club takes
care of the rent, utility and laun
dry bills.
