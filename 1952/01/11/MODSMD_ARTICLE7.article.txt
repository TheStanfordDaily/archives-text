# 'Boy Wonder,' Pop Honored
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Two football coaches, one
young and one okl, were given
the highest honor that can come
to a coach last night at Cincin
nati. And they were both from
Stanford.
One was Chuck Taylor, the
grinning .'5l-year-old "youngster"
who was selected by his coaching
colleagues as the "Coach of the
Year." The other was a man 50
years Chuck's senior, Pop War
ner. He was selected by the na
tion's coaches as the "Coach of All
Years."
Taylor came to Stanford last
spring and expected his team to win
half its games. The "experts"

The inan of honor at the Coach
of the Year banquet was almost
barred attendance through a slight
technicality.
In order to encourage coaches to
vote for top mentor of the year, it
was stipulated that a ballot would
serve as an admission ticket to the
banquet in Cincinnati.
Due to a slight mix-up, Chuck
Taylor never got around to casting
his vote, but in view of the circum
stances . . . well, they decided to let
Chuck come anyway.

thought that he was being optimis
tic. Despite a slow start, he won the
PCC in a year when the competi
tion was tougher than ever. That
was why he received the large
Scripps - Howard award as "Coach
of the Year." He was the youngest
mentor ever to receive that distinc
tion.
Glen Scobey Warner has con
tributed more to the game of foot
ball as we now know it than any
other man alive. He coached many
great Stanford teams and the pic

turesque Carlisle Indians (with Jim
Thorpe) among others.
Pop invented real power foot
hall, the single wing, double wing,
man -in - motion. Hankers, and
many other innovations. That was
why he was the first coach ever to
he selected the "Coach of All
Years."
Taylor, in his speech, said, "As I
am sure you coaches know, a suc
cessful season can never be the
work of one man, the head coach.
If it were possible, I would like to
split this award into many pieces.
Joe Ruetz, Dutch Fehring, Pete
Kmetovic, Bob Ghilotti, Gyorge
Lynn, and Mai Elward were of in
valuable assistance. Also, I can't
receive an award like this without
mentioning kids like McColl, Ker
korian, Cone, Horn, and others. Our
team had real spirit; that's what put
'em through."

THE WEATHER
KANT A CLARA VALLEY —
Mostly cloudy with occasional rain
today and tomorrow. Continued
cold. High today, 50-54; low to
night, 20-30.
