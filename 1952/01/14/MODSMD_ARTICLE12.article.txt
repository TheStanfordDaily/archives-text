# Excuse for Illness Plan Is Approved
## 
### 
The Academic Council, a faculty governing group, passed a
new health excuse plan Friday that eliminates Health Service
statement of illness certificates and makes a student's word to
his instructor acceptable for absence. The plan, which was ap
proved last quarter by Excom, passed the faculty group "without

objection," according to Dr. George
Houck, Health Service director.
The new plan falls under the
Honor Code and violations are to
come- before Men's and Women's
Councils. It will not apply to final
examinations.
The plan goes into effect imme
diately on an experimental basis
for one academic year.
Pete Halle, chairman of the
Student Health Committee, and
Dean of Students 11. Donald Win
bigler said they were "confident"
the plan would prove successful.
'I he Student Health Committee,
which originated the plan, stated
the following reasons for it in
their recommendation:
*'1. The present system suggests
a lack of confidence in the student.
This is inconsistent with the Stan
ford policy followed in tests and
other gradsd work.
"2. Statements of illness, request
ed by the faculty, are obtained at
the expenditure of time and effort
by the student. This frequently has
an adverse effect on student health.
Students who should not be in class
frequently attend rather than spend
valuable time obtaining health cer
tificates.
"3. An undue burden is placed on
the staff of the Health Service.
Considerable time is spent in non
productive work; repeatedly this
entails determining the extent of an
illness after the evidence of that
illness has passed. This frequently
means that the physician, too, must
rely on the word of the student."
