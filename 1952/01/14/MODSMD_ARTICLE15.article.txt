# Poll to Show Interest In Scholarships
## 
### 
The Foreign Scholarship
Committee is now making ten
tative plans to negotiate ex
change scholarships with for
eign universities next year. The
committee hopes to arrange
room and board and tuition
grants from some of the foreign
universities sending exchange
scholars to this University under
the ASSU's special scholar
ships.
Phil Saeta and Dick Wcisman,
co-chairmen of the committee, urge
everyone interested in studying
abroad next year to contact them
at the Foreign Scholarship Com
mittee office in the Old Union
building from li to 5 any afternoon
this week.
Stressing the fact that these first
interviews are only a preliminary
poll to determine the amount of
student interest, they asked for a
maximum turnout.
Qualifications
Qualifications for the scholarships
have not yet been determined, but
they will probably include a work
ing knowledge 112 112 the language of
the country in which the study is to
be done, good academic standing at
Stanford, and some participation in
extra-curricular activities.
Both graduate and undergraduate
students arc eligible. Lack of pro
ficiency in a foreign language need
not be a handicap, since English
language universities in England
and India may participate in the
exchange.
Two Stanford students are al
ready abroad under similar grants
made last year. Floyd St. Clair is
studying at Hie institute d'Etudes
Politiques in Paris and Phil Niel
sen at the Free University of Ber
lin.
The specific universities to be in
cluded in the exchange will depend
upon the home schools of the seven
foreign scholars whom the living
groups select for the ASSU scholar
ships this spring.
