# Open Rush Is On Today
## 
### 
Fraternity rushing rolls on today
into the big week of open rushing
activities.
First reports of informal pledging
show a wide variation in the num
ber of men pinned by various
houses. Some report none and at
least one has as many as 15 men
pledged.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Tony Garrett cautioned fresh
men to be certain of the house they
desire to join before they accept a
pin.
He also reminded that no pledge
is binding until the pledge card is
signed next Monday night, but
hoped that with men making their
decisions sincerely house-switching
would be held to a minimum.
The program for this week will
include an intensive series of lunch
eons and dinners at the various
houses coupled with parties and
beer busts.
