# IIR Hosts UNESCO Conference
## 
### 
Idealism to be practical must
be transferred into action,
Wayne Alley, ASSU president,
told 175 high school delegates
at the opening session of the
llR's Fourth Annual Northern
California High School Confer
ence on UNESCO Friday night.
Mrs. Henry Potter Russell, vice
chairman of the United States Na
tional Commission for UNESCO, la
ter gave the delegates suggestions
for carrying out the broad prin- |
ciples of international idealism. Ex
pansion of individual friendships is
the key to working out this ideal
ism, she said.
Through the UNESCO Rift cou
pon plan, youth travel programs
abroad, affiliation with foreign j
schools, pen pals, and exchange stu- j
dents, American high school stu- '
dents can further this aim a great
deal, she emphasized.
American Culture
"We send jazz bands to Europe
but never an American symphony
orchestra, ballet company, or art j
exhibit," Mrs. Russell explained, j
The result, she said, is that coun
tries abroad are often mistaken as
to what Americans arc really like.
The next day Dr. Graham Stuart.
Stanford professor of political sci- 1
ence, in a talk entitled "How We
Make Our Foreign Policy," pointed
out that "the State Department
abroad is our first line of defense." i
It is trained to maintain a foreign |
policy acceptable both to the United
States and to foreign countries, he |

said.
Achcson Defended
Dr. Stuart covered in his tall; the
role of the President, the State De
partment, the Senate, and public
opinion in forming foreign policy.
Ho disapproved of President Tru
man's appointing an ambassador lo
the Vatican, called Dean Achcson
"one of tlie ten ablest Secretaries
of State in United States history,"
and deplored the "fallacious" at
tacks on men like Philip Jessup. Dr.
Stuart said lie considers himself a
Republican.
"Christianity, operating on an in
ternational scale, lakes a mode of
action that is not susceptible lo de
feat," the Rev. Alexander Miller,
Stanford professor of religion, told
the delrg a t e s Saturday night.
"Christianity is free from illusions,
and therefore it, is free from dis
illusion," Miller said.
Christianity vs. Communism
In contrast to authoritarian sys
tems like Communism and Fascism,
Miller held that Christianity offers
a practical answer to the helpless
ness and confusion common among
citizens of all nations today. Com
munism, he said, assert ; that, what
is historically successful is right-
Christianity on the other hand,
lazy thinking, he said, are the great
cess.
Conrad von Bihra, president of
j the III?, officially dismissed the con
ference yesterday with a plea for
constructive thinking on all phases
he explained, puts truth above suc
of international relations. Fear and
obstacles to action.


"YOU AND YOUR HIGH SCHOOL"-Richard Heggie, assist
ant director, World Affairs Council of Northern California,
wound up the formal talks of the llR's Conference on UNESCO
yesterday. He gave the delegates advice on how their high
schools can be a means of strengthening the United Nations.
