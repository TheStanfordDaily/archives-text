# Cards Stager to Even Split With Cal; Fall Behind Bruins
## Ricksen Out With Injury 
### DICK KLEIN 
The somewhat faltering In
dian basketball squad was
handed a split in a two-gams
weekend series by the Califor
nia Bears. On Friday Stanford
won an exciting contest in the
Pavilion, 81 to 74. The Bears
evened the count, 72 to 53, Sat
urday night on their home court.
Biggest surprise of the series was
Bob McKeen, Cal's huge 6-ft. 7-in.
frosh center, who scored 36 points
in the two games. Having a combi
nation of several good shots, Mc-
Keen continually slipped away from
the usually reliable Indian captain,
Jim Ramstead.
The Pavilion contest was a weird
one with very mediocre playing on
both sides and bad reffing through
out. Some of the calls were boord
loudly by both Cal and Stanford
rooters. For a while, it looked as if
the two referees were going to let
the game get out of hand by allow
ing plenty of contact before making
a call.
The beginning of the fourth quar
ter was a real mix-up. The refs had
the centers faced in the wrong di
rection and both teams were baf
fled. Both were running toward the
wrong basket, until a frantic call
from the Stanford bench sent Olic
Suzdaleff driving to the unguarded
Card bucket for a quick lay-up.
After the opening tip, Jim Walsh
put the Cards out in front but the
lead was quickly nipped by an alert
Bear team that took advantage of
the many Indian passing miscues.
Although the score was tied five
times, the Bears pulled away to a
seven-point 29 to 22 lead by the end
of the first quarter.
Center McKeen -paced the first
quarter Cal attack with "10 point:)
and plenty of rebounds. Ron Tom
sic and Eddie Tucker kept the In
dians within striking distance with
timely shots.

The UCLA Bruins whipped
USC twice in two weekend
held in Los Angeles' Pan-Pacific
Auditorium. This put the Bruins
on top of the Southern Division
basketball race. See sports page
for complete PCC standings.

The gap was slowly closed in a
rough second quarter which was
slowed clown by many fouls. Tom
DuFour, who replaced Tucker rest
ing with four fouls, made a jump
shot to put the Indians ahead 37 to
36 midway in the period. Half-time
score was Stanford 43, Cal 41.
A series of fast bucket'; by Mr-
Keen, Rupe Ricksen, Tom Green
leaf, and Jim Doan erased the Card
lead and put the Bears ahead 59 to
44. The lead was maintained and
the quarter ended 63 to 58.
The opening of the final period


BATTLE FOR BALL —Jim Ramstead (10) and Frank Hoaglund leap for a rebound in first quarter
action here Friday night. Stanford won 81-74, but the Bears came back Saturday night to whip
the Indians 72-63. Stanford's Gary Andrews and Larry Horan of the Bears look on at left.
