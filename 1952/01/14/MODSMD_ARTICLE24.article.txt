# Cards Stager to Even Split With Cal; Fall Behind Bruins
## Ricksen Out With Injury 
### DICK KLEIN 
The somewhat faltering In
dian basketball squad was
handed a split in a two-gams
weekend series by the Califor
nia Bears. On Friday Stanford
won an exciting contest in the
Pavilion, 81 to 74. The Bears
evened the count, 72 to 53, Sat
urday night on their home court.
Biggest surprise of the series was
Bob McKeen, Cal's huge 6-ft. 7-in.
frosh center, who scored 36 points
in the two games. Having a combi
nation of several good shots, Mc-
Keen continually slipped away from
the usually reliable Indian captain,
Jim Ramstead.
The Pavilion contest was a weird
one with very mediocre playing on
both sides and bad reffing through
out. Some of the calls were boord
loudly by both Cal and Stanford
rooters. For a while, it looked as if
the two referees were going to let
the game get out of hand by allow
ing plenty of contact before making
a call.
The beginning of the fourth quar
ter was a real mix-up. The refs had
the centers faced in the wrong di
rection and both teams were baf
fled. Both were running toward the
wrong basket, until a frantic call
from the Stanford bench sent Olic
Suzdaleff driving to the unguarded
Card bucket for a quick lay-up.
After the opening tip, Jim Walsh
put the Cards out in front but the
lead was quickly nipped by an alert
Bear team that took advantage of
the many Indian passing miscues.
Although the score was tied five
times, the Bears pulled away to a
seven-point 29 to 22 lead by the end
of the first quarter.
Center McKeen -paced the first
quarter Cal attack with "10 point:)
and plenty of rebounds. Ron Tom
sic and Eddie Tucker kept the In
dians within striking distance with
timely shots.

The UCLA Bruins whipped
USC twice in two weekend
held in Los Angeles' Pan-Pacific
Auditorium. This put the Bruins
on top of the Southern Division
basketball race. See sports page
for complete PCC standings.

The gap was slowly closed in a
rough second quarter which was
slowed clown by many fouls. Tom
DuFour, who replaced Tucker rest
ing with four fouls, made a jump
shot to put the Indians ahead 37 to
36 midway in the period. Half-time
score was Stanford 43, Cal 41.
A series of fast bucket'; by Mr-
Keen, Rupe Ricksen, Tom Green
leaf, and Jim Doan erased the Card
lead and put the Bears ahead 59 to
44. The lead was maintained and
the quarter ended 63 to 58.
The opening of the final period


BATTLE FOR BALL —Jim Ramstead (10) and Frank Hoaglund leap for a rebound in first quarter
action here Friday night. Stanford won 81-74, but the Bears came back Saturday night to whip
the Indians 72-63. Stanford's Gary Andrews and Larry Horan of the Bears look on at left.
was marred when Johnny Ricksen,
the Division's leading scorer, banged
into a support trying to break up a
Tucker drive. Ricksen was re
moved from the game with a pain
ful ankle injury which was later
diagnosed as a severe sprain, lie
will be out of action for at least
four weeks.
A few minutes later, Tucker made
the game's greatest shot, a fading
jump shot from the left side of the
basket that put the Indians ahead to
.stay. The score was 04 to 03. Cal
took a time-out and the partisan
Pavilion crowd stomped the floor
for a victory drive.
The Bears proceeded to fold. With
J. Ricksen out, a parade of Cal first
stringers began to pick up five fouls
an<l crowd the bench with disheart
ened, bewildered Bears. Bob Albo,
brother Rupe Ricksen, Frank Hoag
land, and Greenleaf fouled out in
that order.
The Indians poured it on and
scored 25 points to the Bears' 11 in
the canto to win 81 to 74. In victory,
the Cards were lacking plenty in
backboard control and the passing
on the fast break was amazingly
sloppy. Even though the Rammer
got 17 points, lie failed to bottle up
McKeen. Eddie Tucker and Mc-
Keen were high with 20.
Before a roaring, boisterous Cali
fornia crowd of 0,700 fans that
packed the big Berkeley Gym, Jim
my Doan weaved his way through
a porous Indian defense to lead the
Bears to a win. Doan, mainly on
powerful drive-in lay-ups, scored
23 points and still managed to sit
a good portion of the second half
on the bench.
The Bears maintained superior

board control and hit a good per
centage. Stanford had much im
proved passing but failed to connect
with many easy shots and then
wasted lots of ball possession with
wild tosses at the backboard. Tuck
er gained leadership in Southern
Division scoring by meshing in 18
and was ably assisted by red-hot
Jim Walsh who bucketed 17.
Next week the Cards go south to
meet the cellar-dwelling USC Tro
jans. Things will have to improve
a lot to beat the rugged Trojan.

The opening of the final period


BATTLE FOR BALL —Jim Ramstead (10) and Frank Hoaglund leap for a rebound in first quarter
action here Friday night. Stanford won 81-74, but the Bears came back Saturday night to whip
the Indians 72-63. Stanford's Gary Andrews and Larry Horan of the Bears look on at left.
was marred when Johnny Ricksen,
the Division's leading scorer, banged
into a support trying to break up a
Tucker drive. Ricksen was re
moved from the game with a pain
ful ankle injury which was later
diagnosed as a severe sprain, lie
will be out of action for at least
four weeks.
A few minutes later, Tucker made
the game's greatest shot, a fading
jump shot from the left side of the
basket that put the Indians ahead to
.stay. The score was 04 to 03. Cal
took a time-out and the partisan
Pavilion crowd stomped the floor
for a victory drive.
The Bears proceeded to fold. With
J. Ricksen out, a parade of Cal first
stringers began to pick up five fouls
an<l crowd the bench with disheart
ened, bewildered Bears. Bob Albo,
brother Rupe Ricksen, Frank Hoag
land, and Greenleaf fouled out in
that order.
The Indians poured it on and
scored 25 points to the Bears' 11 in
the canto to win 81 to 74. In victory,
the Cards were lacking plenty in
backboard control and the passing
on the fast break was amazingly
sloppy. Even though the Rammer
got 17 points, lie failed to bottle up
McKeen. Eddie Tucker and Mc-
Keen were high with 20.
Before a roaring, boisterous Cali
fornia crowd of 0,700 fans that
packed the big Berkeley Gym, Jim
my Doan weaved his way through
a porous Indian defense to lead the
Bears to a win. Doan, mainly on
powerful drive-in lay-ups, scored
23 points and still managed to sit
a good portion of the second half
on the bench.
The Bears maintained superior

board control and hit a good per
centage. Stanford had much im
proved passing but failed to connect
with many easy shots and then
wasted lots of ball possession with
wild tosses at the backboard. Tuck
er gained leadership in Southern
Division scoring by meshing in 18
and was ably assisted by red-hot
Jim Walsh who bucketed 17.
Next week the Cards go south to
meet the cellar-dwelling USC Tro
jans. Things will have to improve
a lot to beat the rugged Trojan.

quarter of Friday's game against

the highest output of his varsity
career. Stanford had a phenome

floor. Tomsic's shot pictured here

The somewhat faltering In
dian basketball squad was
handed a split in a two-gams
weekend series by the Califor
nia Bears. On Friday Stanford
won an exciting contest in the
Pavilion, 81 to 74. The Bears
evened the count, 72 to 53, Sat
urday night on their home court.
Biggest surprise of the series was
Bob McKeen, Cal's huge 6-ft. 7-in.
frosh center, who scored 36 points
in the two games. Having a combi
nation of several good shots, Mc-
Keen continually slipped away from
the usually reliable Indian captain,
Jim Ramstead.
The Pavilion contest was a weird
one with very mediocre playing on
both sides and bad reffing through
out. Some of the calls were boord
loudly by both Cal and Stanford
rooters. For a while, it looked as if
the two referees were going to let
the game get out of hand by allow
ing plenty of contact before making
a call.
The beginning of the fourth quar
ter was a real mix-up. The refs had
the centers faced in the wrong di
rection and both teams were baf
fled. Both were running toward the
wrong basket, until a frantic call
from the Stanford bench sent Olic
Suzdaleff driving to the unguarded
Card bucket for a quick lay-up.
After the opening tip, Jim Walsh
put the Cards out in front but the
lead was quickly nipped by an alert
Bear team that took advantage of
the many Indian passing miscues.
Although the score was tied five
times, the Bears pulled away to a
seven-point 29 to 22 lead by the end
of the first quarter.
Center McKeen -paced the first
quarter Cal attack with "10 point:)
and plenty of rebounds. Ron Tom
sic and Eddie Tucker kept the In
dians within striking distance with
timely shots.

The UCLA Bruins whipped
USC twice in two weekend
held in Los Angeles' Pan-Pacific
Auditorium. This put the Bruins
on top of the Southern Division
basketball race. See sports page
for complete PCC standings.

The gap was slowly closed in a
rough second quarter which was
slowed clown by many fouls. Tom
DuFour, who replaced Tucker rest
ing with four fouls, made a jump
shot to put the Indians ahead 37 to
36 midway in the period. Half-time
score was Stanford 43, Cal 41.
A series of fast bucket'; by Mr-
Keen, Rupe Ricksen, Tom Green
leaf, and Jim Doan erased the Card
lead and put the Bears ahead 59 to
44. The lead was maintained and
the quarter ended 63 to 58.

TOMSIC FOR TWO —Stanford's
fireball forward Ron Tomsic pours
in a bucket early in the second
quarter of Friday's game against
Cat. Ron hit IK points that night,
the highest output of his varsity
career. Stanford had a phenome
nal .473 percentage from the
floor. Tomsic's shot pictured here
brought the score to 36-33 in fa
vor of the Bears. Looking on is

The somewhat faltering In
dian basketball squad was
handed a split in a two-gams
weekend series by the Califor
nia Bears. On Friday Stanford
won an exciting contest in the
Pavilion, 81 to 74. The Bears
evened the count, 72 to 53, Sat
urday night on their home court.
Biggest surprise of the series was
Bob McKeen, Cal's huge 6-ft. 7-in.
frosh center, who scored 36 points
in the two games. Having a combi
nation of several good shots, Mc-
Keen continually slipped away from
the usually reliable Indian captain,
Jim Ramstead.
The Pavilion contest was a weird
one with very mediocre playing on
both sides and bad reffing through
out. Some of the calls were boord
loudly by both Cal and Stanford
rooters. For a while, it looked as if
the two referees were going to let
the game get out of hand by allow
ing plenty of contact before making
a call.
The beginning of the fourth quar
ter was a real mix-up. The refs had
the centers faced in the wrong di
rection and both teams were baf
fled. Both were running toward the
wrong basket, until a frantic call
from the Stanford bench sent Olic
Suzdaleff driving to the unguarded
Card bucket for a quick lay-up.
After the opening tip, Jim Walsh
put the Cards out in front but the
lead was quickly nipped by an alert
Bear team that took advantage of
the many Indian passing miscues.
Although the score was tied five
times, the Bears pulled away to a
seven-point 29 to 22 lead by the end
of the first quarter.
Center McKeen -paced the first
quarter Cal attack with "10 point:)
and plenty of rebounds. Ron Tom
sic and Eddie Tucker kept the In
dians within striking distance with
timely shots.

The UCLA Bruins whipped
USC twice in two weekend
held in Los Angeles' Pan-Pacific
Auditorium. This put the Bruins
on top of the Southern Division
basketball race. See sports page
for complete PCC standings.

The gap was slowly closed in a
rough second quarter which was
slowed clown by many fouls. Tom
DuFour, who replaced Tucker rest
ing with four fouls, made a jump
shot to put the Indians ahead 37 to
36 midway in the period. Half-time
score was Stanford 43, Cal 41.
A series of fast bucket'; by Mr-
Keen, Rupe Ricksen, Tom Green
leaf, and Jim Doan erased the Card
lead and put the Bears ahead 59 to
44. The lead was maintained and
the quarter ended 63 to 58.
The opening of the final period


BATTLE FOR BALL —Jim Ramstead (10) and Frank Hoaglund leap for a rebound in first quarter
action here Friday night. Stanford won 81-74, but the Bears came back Saturday night to whip
the Indians 72-63. Stanford's Gary Andrews and Larry Horan of the Bears look on at left.
was marred when Johnny Ricksen,
the Division's leading scorer, banged
into a support trying to break up a
Tucker drive. Ricksen was re
moved from the game with a pain
ful ankle injury which was later
diagnosed as a severe sprain, lie
will be out of action for at least
four weeks.
A few minutes later, Tucker made
the game's greatest shot, a fading
jump shot from the left side of the
basket that put the Indians ahead to
.stay. The score was 04 to 03. Cal
took a time-out and the partisan
Pavilion crowd stomped the floor
for a victory drive.
The Bears proceeded to fold. With
J. Ricksen out, a parade of Cal first
stringers began to pick up five fouls
an<l crowd the bench with disheart
ened, bewildered Bears. Bob Albo,
brother Rupe Ricksen, Frank Hoag
land, and Greenleaf fouled out in
that order.
The Indians poured it on and
scored 25 points to the Bears' 11 in
the canto to win 81 to 74. In victory,
the Cards were lacking plenty in
backboard control and the passing
on the fast break was amazingly
sloppy. Even though the Rammer
got 17 points, lie failed to bottle up
McKeen. Eddie Tucker and Mc-
Keen were high with 20.
Before a roaring, boisterous Cali
fornia crowd of 0,700 fans that
packed the big Berkeley Gym, Jim
my Doan weaved his way through
a porous Indian defense to lead the
Bears to a win. Doan, mainly on
powerful drive-in lay-ups, scored
23 points and still managed to sit
a good portion of the second half
on the bench.
The Bears maintained superior

board control and hit a good per
centage. Stanford had much im
proved passing but failed to connect
with many easy shots and then
wasted lots of ball possession with
wild tosses at the backboard. Tuck
er gained leadership in Southern
Division scoring by meshing in 18
and was ably assisted by red-hot
Jim Walsh who bucketed 17.
Next week the Cards go south to
meet the cellar-dwelling USC Tro
jans. Things will have to improve
a lot to beat the rugged Trojan.

quarter of Friday's game against

the highest output of his varsity
career. Stanford had a phenome

floor. Tomsic's shot pictured here

The somewhat faltering In
dian basketball squad was
handed a split in a two-gams
weekend series by the Califor
nia Bears. On Friday Stanford
won an exciting contest in the
Pavilion, 81 to 74. The Bears
evened the count, 72 to 53, Sat
urday night on their home court.
Biggest surprise of the series was
Bob McKeen, Cal's huge 6-ft. 7-in.
frosh center, who scored 36 points
in the two games. Having a combi
nation of several good shots, Mc-
Keen continually slipped away from
the usually reliable Indian captain,
Jim Ramstead.
The Pavilion contest was a weird
one with very mediocre playing on
both sides and bad reffing through
out. Some of the calls were boord
loudly by both Cal and Stanford
rooters. For a while, it looked as if
the two referees were going to let
the game get out of hand by allow
ing plenty of contact before making
a call.
The beginning of the fourth quar
ter was a real mix-up. The refs had
the centers faced in the wrong di
rection and both teams were baf
fled. Both were running toward the
wrong basket, until a frantic call
from the Stanford bench sent Olic
Suzdaleff driving to the unguarded
Card bucket for a quick lay-up.
After the opening tip, Jim Walsh
put the Cards out in front but the
lead was quickly nipped by an alert
Bear team that took advantage of
the many Indian passing miscues.
Although the score was tied five
times, the Bears pulled away to a
seven-point 29 to 22 lead by the end
of the first quarter.
Center McKeen -paced the first
quarter Cal attack with "10 point:)
and plenty of rebounds. Ron Tom
sic and Eddie Tucker kept the In
dians within striking distance with
timely shots.

The UCLA Bruins whipped
USC twice in two weekend
held in Los Angeles' Pan-Pacific
Auditorium. This put the Bruins
on top of the Southern Division
basketball race. See sports page
for complete PCC standings.

The gap was slowly closed in a
rough second quarter which was
slowed clown by many fouls. Tom
DuFour, who replaced Tucker rest
ing with four fouls, made a jump
shot to put the Indians ahead 37 to
36 midway in the period. Half-time
score was Stanford 43, Cal 41.
A series of fast bucket'; by Mr-
Keen, Rupe Ricksen, Tom Green
leaf, and Jim Doan erased the Card
lead and put the Bears ahead 59 to
44. The lead was maintained and
the quarter ended 63 to 58.
The opening of the final period


BATTLE FOR BALL —Jim Ramstead (10) and Frank Hoaglund leap for a rebound in first quarter
action here Friday night. Stanford won 81-74, but the Bears came back Saturday night to whip
the Indians 72-63. Stanford's Gary Andrews and Larry Horan of the Bears look on at left.
was marred when Johnny Ricksen,
the Division's leading scorer, banged
into a support trying to break up a
Tucker drive. Ricksen was re
moved from the game with a pain
ful ankle injury which was later
diagnosed as a severe sprain, lie
will be out of action for at least
four weeks.
A few minutes later, Tucker made
the game's greatest shot, a fading
jump shot from the left side of the
basket that put the Indians ahead to
.stay. The score was 04 to 03. Cal
took a time-out and the partisan
Pavilion crowd stomped the floor
for a victory drive.
The Bears proceeded to fold. With
J. Ricksen out, a parade of Cal first
stringers began to pick up five fouls
an<l crowd the bench with disheart
ened, bewildered Bears. Bob Albo,
brother Rupe Ricksen, Frank Hoag
land, and Greenleaf fouled out in
that order.
The Indians poured it on and
scored 25 points to the Bears' 11 in
the canto to win 81 to 74. In victory,
the Cards were lacking plenty in
backboard control and the passing
on the fast break was amazingly
sloppy. Even though the Rammer
got 17 points, lie failed to bottle up
McKeen. Eddie Tucker and Mc-
Keen were high with 20.
Before a roaring, boisterous Cali
fornia crowd of 0,700 fans that
packed the big Berkeley Gym, Jim
my Doan weaved his way through
a porous Indian defense to lead the
Bears to a win. Doan, mainly on
powerful drive-in lay-ups, scored
23 points and still managed to sit
a good portion of the second half
on the bench.
The Bears maintained superior

board control and hit a good per
centage. Stanford had much im
proved passing but failed to connect
with many easy shots and then
wasted lots of ball possession with
wild tosses at the backboard. Tuck
er gained leadership in Southern
Division scoring by meshing in 18
and was ably assisted by red-hot
Jim Walsh who bucketed 17.
Next week the Cards go south to
meet the cellar-dwelling USC Tro
jans. Things will have to improve
a lot to beat the rugged Trojan.

the centers faced in the wrong di
rection and both teams were baf
fled. Both were running toward the
wrong basket, until a frantic call
from the Stanford bench sent Olic
Suzdaleff driving to the unguarded
Card bucket for a quick lay-up.
After the opening tip, Jim Walsh
put the Cards out in front but the
lead was quickly nipped by an alert
Bear team that took advantage of
the many Indian passing miscues.
Although the score was tied five
times, the Bears pulled away to a
seven-point 29 to 22 lead by the end
of the first quarter.
Center McKeen -paced the first
quarter Cal attack with "10 point:)
and plenty of rebounds. Ron Tom
sic and Eddie Tucker kept the In
dians within striking distance with
timely shots.

The UCLA Bruins whipped
USC twice in two weekend
held in Los Angeles' Pan-Pacific
Auditorium. This put the Bruins
on top of the Southern Division
basketball race. See sports page
for complete PCC standings.

The gap was slowly closed in a
rough second quarter which was
slowed clown by many fouls. Tom
DuFour, who replaced Tucker rest
ing with four fouls, made a jump
shot to put the Indians ahead 37 to
36 midway in the period. Half-time
score was Stanford 43, Cal 41.
A series of fast bucket'; by Mr-

lead and put the Bears ahead 59 to

the quarter ended 63 to 58.

The Pavilion contest was a weird
one with very mediocre playing on
both sides and bad reffing through
out. Some of the calls were boord

the Division's leading scorer, banged
into a support trying to break up a
Tucker drive. Ricksen was re
moved from the game with a pain
ful ankle injury which was later
diagnosed as a severe sprain, lie
will be out of action for at least
four weeks.
A few minutes later, Tucker made
the game's greatest shot, a fading
jump shot from the left side of the
basket that put the Indians ahead to
.stay. The score was 04 to 03. Cal
took a time-out and the partisan
Pavilion crowd stomped the floor
for a victory drive.
The Bears proceeded to fold. With
J. Ricksen out, a parade of Cal first
stringers began to pick up five fouls
an<l crowd the bench with disheart
ened, bewildered Bears. Bob Albo,
brother Rupe Ricksen, Frank Hoag
land, and Greenleaf fouled out in
that order.
The Indians poured it on and
scored 25 points to the Bears' 11 in
the canto to win 81 to 74. In victory,
the Cards were lacking plenty in
backboard control and the passing
on the fast break was amazingly
sloppy. Even though the Rammer
got 17 points, lie failed to bottle up
McKeen. Eddie Tucker and Mc-
Keen were high with 20.
Before a roaring, boisterous Cali
fornia crowd of 0,700 fans that
packed the big Berkeley Gym, Jim
my Doan weaved his way through
a porous Indian defense to lead the
Bears to a win. Doan, mainly on
powerful drive-in lay-ups, scored
23 points and still managed to sit
a good portion of the second half
on the bench.
The Bears maintained superior

board control and hit a good per
centage. Stanford had much im
proved passing but failed to connect
with many easy shots and then
wasted lots of ball possession with
wild tosses at the backboard. Tuck
er gained leadership in Southern
Division scoring by meshing in 18
and was ably assisted by red-hot
Jim Walsh who bucketed 17.
Next week the Cards go south to
meet the cellar-dwelling USC Tro
jans. Things will have to improve
a lot to beat the rugged Trojan.
