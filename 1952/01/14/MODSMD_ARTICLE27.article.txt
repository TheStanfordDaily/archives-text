# Why Not You as a Foreign Scholar?
## 
### 
The foreign scholarship committee had some
'h;ng to say this week, so we listened. We
listened because this committee is one group
at Stanford that deserves attention, from the
point of view of important work accomplished
efficiently.
Plans are being made now by Stanford to
negotiate exchange scholarships with foreign
universities next year, in addition to providing
for the usual seven foreign students here. The
committee needs to know right now the names
of Stanford students who plan to study in any
foreign country next year, and who would be
interested in studying on an exchange scholar
ship basis.
Committee co-chairman Phil Saeta and Dick
Weisman say they must have a good idea of
what foreign universities will be attended by
Stanfordites, so that negotiations can be started.
Floyd St. Clair, now studying in Paris, and Phil
Neilsen at the Free University of Berlin are
Stanford's two exchange scholars this year.
Why not you as a foreign scholar? Stan
ford students have a good chance to try out
for an exchange scholarship, at the same time
helping the whole proqram. (See paqe one
for details.)
Meanwhile, foreign scholars, both here and
in Europe, continue to make news for The

Daily. We're thinking of Dr. Fritz Epstein's A
plus report on Phil Neilsen at Berlin. Other
signs indicate that Stanlord's lour - year old
program aimed at "better world understand
ing and trust" is paying off. Former students
who saw America through Stanford because of
our scholarship program are working at varied
important job:; in their home countries. Their
understanding can't help but aid the larger
world understanding in some measure, at least.
Thus the news that Stanford is attempting
to interest other school!; in similar programs
seems more important than ever. A form
letter was sent to many American universi
ties recently, explaining our program and
urging other schools to start comparable
plans. The Stanford plan is so simple and
sensible—the University pays hall tuition;
living groups pay room and board; the ASSU
pays halt tuition and books that it will cer
tainly make sense to other schools. Harvard
and California have indicated interest al
ready.
II only seven schools decide to adopt the
program by providing for one scholar each,
then lourteen instead ol seven leaders from
foreign, schools would come to the USA. The
contribution towatd that vague but vital ideal
of world understanding would be p.o murh the
greater.

our scholarship program are working at varied
important job:; in their home countries. Their
understanding can't help but aid the larger
world understanding in some measure, at least.
Thus the news that Stanford is attempting
to interest other school!; in similar programs
seems more important than ever. A form
letter was sent to many American universi
ties recently, explaining our program and
urging other schools to start comparable
plans. The Stanford plan is so simple and
sensible—the University pays hall tuition;
living groups pay room and board; the ASSU
pays halt tuition and books that it will cer
tainly make sense to other schools. Harvard
and California have indicated interest al
ready.
II only seven schools decide to adopt the
program by providing for one scholar each,
then lourteen instead ol seven leaders from
foreign, schools would come to the USA. The
contribution towatd that vague but vital ideal
of world understanding would be p.o murh the
greater.
The foreign scholarship committee had some
'h;ng to say this week, so we listened. We
listened because this committee is one group
at Stanford that deserves attention, from the
point of view of important work accomplished
efficiently.
Plans are being made now by Stanford to
negotiate exchange scholarships with foreign
universities next year, in addition to providing
for the usual seven foreign students here. The
committee needs to know right now the names
of Stanford students who plan to study in any
foreign country next year, and who would be
interested in studying on an exchange scholar
ship basis.
Committee co-chairman Phil Saeta and Dick
Weisman say they must have a good idea of
what foreign universities will be attended by
Stanfordites, so that negotiations can be started.
Floyd St. Clair, now studying in Paris, and Phil
Neilsen at the Free University of Berlin are
Stanford's two exchange scholars this year.
Why not you as a foreign scholar? Stan
ford students have a good chance to try out
for an exchange scholarship, at the same time
helping the whole proqram. (See paqe one
for details.)
Meanwhile, foreign scholars, both here and
in Europe, continue to make news for The

Daily. We're thinking of Dr. Fritz Epstein's A
plus report on Phil Neilsen at Berlin. Other
signs indicate that Stanlord's lour - year old
program aimed at "better world understand
ing and trust" is paying off. Former students
who saw America through Stanford because of
our scholarship program are working at varied
important job:; in their home countries. Their
understanding can't help but aid the larger
world understanding in some measure, at least.
