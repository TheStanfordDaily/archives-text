# Slamming Other Houses Can Backfire
## 
### 
Freshmen rushees have been bombarded
through the Jnterfraternity Magazine, Daily
Bull Sessions, and campus advice-givers with
tips for the rushing season.
It seems that a tip might be in order for the
other side of the fence, the houses. Fraternities
at Stanford have long prided themselves on the
lack of inter fraternity strife here. And it has
been one of the greatest virtues of Stanford's
fraternity set-up.
But a series of rumors, half truths, exaggera
tions. and downright lies, circulated by certain

houses about the disadvantages of other houses
have found their way to many frosh this year.
This sort of thing can lead only to increased
strife, confusion among the frosh, and a good
deal of general ill will.
Fraternities can point out their individual ad
vantages without resorting to tearing down
their competitors in the scramble for pledges.
And this circulation of false rumors can
easily boomerang, injuring the house that orig
inates them more than the ones it intends to
hurt.â€”J,M.
