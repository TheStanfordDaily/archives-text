SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
I shall take the barren desert and {jive it to
bloom. And render it unto my people.
—Exodus 18: 21-22
Now don't get me wrong. ] like Southern California.
I don t think there is anything really wrong with the
region. It's just different—the usual excuse, given for
anything slightly batty. I'm not criticizing but some
times the place kind of jars you, especially when you
come from the northern civilized part of this bountiful
state.
A professor in the sociology department calls it
the most japidly changing sociological area in the
world. I don't fully understand what he means but
i; he s saying that the place doesn't know the word
"convention," he's hit it.

I think the trouble began when
they laid out the city. There are
two theories to explain the size
of the city of Los Angeles and the
adjacent southland. One theory is
that the iellow was a Russian with
a dream of empire in the back of
his mind. He just kept extending
and re-extending the bouridaiies.
(His real aim was to encompass all
of California, secede from the
Union, declare war on the United

States, establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, and
put everyone to woik in the aircraft industry. With
airpower he intended to conquer the world.) For
tunately he didn't quite succeed.
The other theory is that the first man to settle the
place was a real estate salesman with a dream, a
vision—of becoming a multi-millionaire. To decide
the boundaries he set up a 155 millimeter cannon
and fired it in four directions. Where the shells hit,
he erected "City Limit" and "Welcome Rotary" signs.
He didn't become a millionaire however, lie went
broke trying to clear the cactus oil the land. The
poor fellow died most tragically in 1921. He had de
cided to survey his whole kingdom but forgot his
canteen and perished of thirst. A victim ol his own
fiendish trap.
As the city and the connected speed ways to sub
ui bs are extravagant, so are the people. Their skin
is deeply tanned from the semi-desert land and their
eyes are red from the peculiar desert fog called smog
(A word derived from the expression "Just SMell that
fOC,.") Apparently this disturbance to the eyes has
affected their color perspective. Only in the city of
Los Angeles does red mix with chartreuse. Only in

the southland is it acceptable for girls to attend church
in shorts. But don't get me wrong. I like shorts.
Hair styles are different down south, too. 'Ilie
young men all wear their hair in looping, swept
hack, greased folds that gracefully arch over the
ears and curl hi ringlets under the lobes. This fad
is attributed to Gorgeous George. The girls are com
ing to look more and more like the flappers of the
Roaring 2U's. Their hair and skirts are shorter. The
Charleston is running rampant. Next to the A-boinb
the big fear down south is that the boyish figure will
return. (Should this happen, one of the biggest in
dustries in the southland will collapse like a
punctured balloon, if you'll excuse the simile.)
The Southern California cars are different too. The
motto of the auto salesman in L A. is, "If it doesn't
glow, whir, sparkle, or spin, it's no good." Every car
has a mirror finish with a short shot of irridescence
thrown in lor good measure. If the surface of any
thing is metal and unpainted, it is chromed. The
bumpers, hub caps, window frames and ornaments all
sparkle. The latest fad is to put a coat of transparent
luminous paint over the whole car so that it will not
only scintillate but glow in the dark.
Southern California leads the world in original
advertising. It claims to have the first flag pole
sitter, neon sign, and singing commercial. Rut the
best sign ol all war, on one of the speedways. It read:
DON'T BE A SLOW POKE
SAVE TIME
DRIVE FAST

The L.A. homes are nice too. In the south a home
is "all that which surrounds and is adjacent to the
garage.'." Every house has a thirty foot aeriel which
revolves and takes pictures from the air and traces
them on a screen. This is called television and is more
important than the kitchen of the home and only
: lightly less necessary than the bathroom. Frank Lloyd
Wright designed most of the houses. He does it so
easily that he can do them in his sleep. And did.
JVlayb*' you remember the famous movie about the
LA. homes entitled "Nightmare Alley." Tyrone played
the pail ol the architect. I'll never forget the great
scent- where they discover that (in reality) he has been
znad for years. You remember.
Rut I'm honip now from the southland. Here the
rain falls free from the sky and a street is a .street —
not a highway —and the fog smells like fog and the
people look like humans. And 1 can remember it all
fondly. In fact I can even appreciate it. They're not
really crazy, just different.
