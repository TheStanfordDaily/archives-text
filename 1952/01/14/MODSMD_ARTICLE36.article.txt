# Cal Finances In Hot Water; $90,000 Loss
## 
### 
Cal is having financial troubles,
too. The ASUC made $90,5.'i8 less
in the year ending June 30, 1951,
than it did the year before. The
departure of the Gl's and the de
crease in enrollment accounted for
the set-hack.
Athletics was one of the bright
spots in the statement, showing a
profit over last year's loss. All
sports except football were listed
under losses, and if it were not for
the fact that the football team went
to the Rose Bowl, the overall sports
picture would have wound up in the
red.
The financial statement showed
the ASUC is going to have to
tighten its belt, sell more student
body cards, or appeal to its neigh
bor down the Peninsula to raise the
tuition.
