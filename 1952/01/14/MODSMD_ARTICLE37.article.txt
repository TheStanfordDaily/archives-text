# Commuters' List Available at Nitery
## 
### 
Off-campus students who missed
signing the Alpha Phi Omega com
muters' list on registration day may
now pick up a copy of the ii.it at
the ASSU office in the Nitery.
Copies ol the list were- sent out
last week to those students who
registered at the national service
fraternity booth on reg day. In
charge of compiling and mailing the
quarterly service project was A Phi
O member Skip Fortson.
