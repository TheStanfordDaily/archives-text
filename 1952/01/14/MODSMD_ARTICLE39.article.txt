Last week the quarter opened and so did this column, taking as its sub
ject swimming because of the rain. The weather is still very much in favor
of aquatic sports, so from the middle of one of the lakes in the gardens near
Palm Drive we'll issue forth with the latest scoop on small boat sailing on
the Farm.
Unheknnwst to the Athletic Department, Excom, tlie faculty, and prob
ably 6,500 of Stanford's students, the Cards are represented in the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association by a sailing team. And a
very fine one to boot.
Ever since the PCIYRA was formed, the Cards have finished no worse
than third in the Annual championship regatta. In the Dec. 1950 sail, they
were second to Cal, and again this past Xmas vacation a Stanford team
finished a close second to the Golden Bears of Berkeley.
Junior Dan Elliott, Soph Mike Jaeger, and Frosh Paul Merrill—fine
rmall boat skippers all—had Cal tied two races apiece until Jaeger fouled
out shortly after the start of the fifth and deciding race to give the crown
to the Bears.
Elliott and Jaeger are presently making plans to travel east this summer
for the National intercollegiate championships, where they'll have a great
time and get reams of favorable publicity for Stanford and Stanford sailing.
But the gimmick to the whole setup is the word several paragraphs
earlier "unheknowst." For sailing at Stanford is not recognized as a minor
sport. Nor is there a chapter of the Racing Association on campus. The
team that represents the Farm so well is the result of just a few guy's
eagerness to sail and willingness to spend the dough for the entrance fees.
The same organization iust described as lacking is what the guys on
the team are now interested in developing: recognition by the University
as minor sport, on a similar basis as crew or skiing, and organization under
C'o-Rec (»112 a chapter of the Association.
Elliott and Merrill are presently setting in motion the wheels of action to
accomplish this organization. What will be necessary next is for the multi
tude of small boat skippers on campus to come out from under their various
bushes and get into this thing, which should be a lot of fun.
The Daily sports stalT and this columnist in particular will be right on
top of the latest developments in the situation and will print thein as they
develop, hut why don't the sailors among you drop the column a line.
We'll pass your name on to Merrill.

eastern swing with the club.

Elliott and Merrill are presently setting in motion the wheels of action to
accomplish this organization. What will be necessary next is for the multi
tude of small boat skippers on campus to come out from under their various
bushes and get into this thing, which should be a lot of fun.
The Daily sports stalT and this columnist in particular will be right on
top of the latest developments in the situation and will print thein as they

quintet, starring George Yardley, has averaged 95.8 points per game in its
first live games in the 11th Naval District. Don Carlsen, Stanford eager,
declared ineligible for Winter Quarter, has joined the Stewart Chevrolets
AAU squad and will probably return to school after completing the current
eastern swing with the club.
Last week the quarter opened and so did this column, taking as its sub
ject swimming because of the rain. The weather is still very much in favor
of aquatic sports, so from the middle of one of the lakes in the gardens near
Palm Drive we'll issue forth with the latest scoop on small boat sailing on
the Farm.
Unheknnwst to the Athletic Department, Excom, tlie faculty, and prob
ably 6,500 of Stanford's students, the Cards are represented in the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association by a sailing team. And a
very fine one to boot.
Ever since the PCIYRA was formed, the Cards have finished no worse
than third in the Annual championship regatta. In the Dec. 1950 sail, they
were second to Cal, and again this past Xmas vacation a Stanford team
finished a close second to the Golden Bears of Berkeley.
Junior Dan Elliott, Soph Mike Jaeger, and Frosh Paul Merrill—fine
rmall boat skippers all—had Cal tied two races apiece until Jaeger fouled
out shortly after the start of the fifth and deciding race to give the crown
to the Bears.
Elliott and Jaeger are presently making plans to travel east this summer
for the National intercollegiate championships, where they'll have a great
time and get reams of favorable publicity for Stanford and Stanford sailing.
But the gimmick to the whole setup is the word several paragraphs
earlier "unheknowst." For sailing at Stanford is not recognized as a minor
sport. Nor is there a chapter of the Racing Association on campus. The
team that represents the Farm so well is the result of just a few guy's
eagerness to sail and willingness to spend the dough for the entrance fees.
The same organization iust described as lacking is what the guys on
the team are now interested in developing: recognition by the University
as minor sport, on a similar basis as crew or skiing, and organization under
C'o-Rec (»112 a chapter of the Association.
