NEW YORK, Jan. 13 (UP)â€” Seton
Hall and Florida toppled from the
ranks of the undefeated major col
lege basketball teams during the
weekend, leaving only five powers
with perfect records today.
Kansas, which barely edged Mis
souri, GO-59, in a Big Seven Confer
ence thriller, led the perfect-record
teams with a string of 12 victories,
followed by Illinois, the nation's No.
1 team, lowa and Duquesne with 10
triumphs each, and St. Bonaventure
with nine.
None of the remaining undefeated
quintets faces a serious threat dur
ing the coming week in which ac
tivity slackens somewhat because of
mid-year examinations.
