# BUSS ON FORMOSA
## 'Most Formosans Would Favor UN Trust Status' 
### DAVID WONG 
That there would be no basic change in the status quo of the
island of Formosa apart from any basic change in United States-
Russia relations was the opinion expressed by Dr. Claude A. Buss,
professor of history and former American diplomat, in an inter
view yesterday.
Dr. Buss has just returned from a tour of the Far East and is now

resuming his teaching duties at
Stanford.
In the interview, Dr. Buss said
that two problems are actually in
volved in the question of Formosa:
first, the development of Formosa
for the improvement of the eco
nomic lot of the people; and sec
ond, the development of Formosa as
a center for a back-to-the-main
land movement. Of the two prob
lems, the latter is the more diffi
cult.
Invasion Anxiety
He said that the Nationalists are
impatient to reinvade the mainland,
for they feel that if they do not
strike this year, then they would be
faced with decreasing chances of
success. They realize that their
armies are the same ones that came
over from the mainland, and that
they are not increasing in numbers.
The Nationalists have tried incor
porating Formosans into their ar
mies, but Dr. Buss said that created
more troubles than it cured.
The attitude of the United States
is to try to slow the Nationalists up
in their attempt at reinvasion. The
iJnited States feels that any mili
tary operation is a complicated bus
iness, and that if it fails because
of premature action, then it would
leave Formosa in a more exposed
position.
American Aid
On the question of American aid
to Formosa, Dr. Buss said: "As long
as aid is modest and limited to de
fense and economic improvement,
there is as much justification for aid
to Nationalist China as there is for
any other country. The circum
stances under which aid is being
delivered now are vastly different
from those of the mainland days.
"But we would be heading to
ward disillusionment if we thought
that a vastly expanded military aid
program would make possible a re
turn to the mainland at this time.
The matter of returning to the
mainland is much more than just
the matter of getting ashore."
Dr. Buss further added that any
diminution of the power and pres
tige of the Communists did not nec
essarily mean an increase in the
power and prestige of the Nation
alists.
As far as administration and eco
nomics are concerned, Dr. Buss
said that improvements have been
made by the Nationalists, who are
fully aware of the consequences of
the great mistakes that were made.
Under K. C. Wu, the Nationalists
have been bending backward to
give the Formosans every economic
break.
Formosa Split
However, Dr. Buss said that there
is a division between the National
ists and the people who were on
Formosa before the Nationalists ar
rived. The Nationalists would like
to see the end of Formosa and the
Formosans would like to see the end

♦
of the Nationalists.
''Most thoughtful Formosans
would welcome trust status under
the United Nations; many would
not object to the return of the island
to Japan. Most of them think that

they are not ready for independ
ence, but very few show any en
thusiasm toward being a part of
China, Nationalist or Communist,"
Dr. 'Buss continued.
In conclusion, he said that Chiang
Kai-shek is still controlling the
show in spite of his age. There is
plenty of talk about reorganization,
but no ierious consideration has
been given to replacing the Gener
alissimo.

I)R. CLAUDE A. BUSS
—Returned from Far East
That there would be no basic change in the status quo of the
island of Formosa apart from any basic change in United States-
Russia relations was the opinion expressed by Dr. Claude A. Buss,
professor of history and former American diplomat, in an inter
view yesterday.
Dr. Buss has just returned from a tour of the Far East and is now

resuming his teaching duties at
Stanford.
In the interview, Dr. Buss said
that two problems are actually in
volved in the question of Formosa:
first, the development of Formosa
for the improvement of the eco
nomic lot of the people; and sec
ond, the development of Formosa as
a center for a back-to-the-main
land movement. Of the two prob
lems, the latter is the more diffi
cult.
Invasion Anxiety
He said that the Nationalists are
impatient to reinvade the mainland,
for they feel that if they do not
strike this year, then they would be
faced with decreasing chances of
success. They realize that their
armies are the same ones that came
over from the mainland, and that
they are not increasing in numbers.
The Nationalists have tried incor
porating Formosans into their ar
mies, but Dr. Buss said that created
more troubles than it cured.
The attitude of the United States
is to try to slow the Nationalists up
in their attempt at reinvasion. The
iJnited States feels that any mili
tary operation is a complicated bus
iness, and that if it fails because
of premature action, then it would
leave Formosa in a more exposed
position.
American Aid
On the question of American aid
to Formosa, Dr. Buss said: "As long
as aid is modest and limited to de
fense and economic improvement,
there is as much justification for aid
to Nationalist China as there is for
any other country. The circum
stances under which aid is being
delivered now are vastly different
from those of the mainland days.
"But we would be heading to
ward disillusionment if we thought
that a vastly expanded military aid
program would make possible a re
turn to the mainland at this time.
The matter of returning to the
mainland is much more than just
the matter of getting ashore."
Dr. Buss further added that any
diminution of the power and pres
tige of the Communists did not nec
essarily mean an increase in the
power and prestige of the Nation
alists.
As far as administration and eco
nomics are concerned, Dr. Buss
said that improvements have been
made by the Nationalists, who are
fully aware of the consequences of
the great mistakes that were made.
Under K. C. Wu, the Nationalists
have been bending backward to
give the Formosans every economic
break.
