# Equipment Forgotten At the Bowl
## 
### 
Some mighty red-faced Stanford
officials are trying to explain today
how the Farm's $15,000 stock of
football equipment was left aban
doned for 10 days in a Pose Bowl
dressing room.
The surprising loss was discov
ered late last week when Encina
Gym workers were taking a rou
tine equipment inventory and found
the Farm's football paraphernalia
missing.
A quick check with officials in
Pasadena revealed that helmets,
pads and all, were still dangling
in Bowl lockers.
Orders were Hashed south on
Thursday requesting that the
multi-thousand-dollar equipment
he packed and rushed hack to
campus.
The equipment, stored in eight
ffiant trunks, arrived here Fri
dayâ€”lo days after the Rose Bowl
contest.
Terming the oversight a "natural
mistake," Donald Liebendorfer,
chief of the Athletic Department's
news office, suid the equipment had
been deserted because of an "ad
ministrative tie-up" which tangled
packing and shipping arrange
ments.
Confusion of authority during the
excitement of post-game clean-up
resulted in no one caring for the
equipment, Liebendorfer said.
Jake Irwin, usual Card equip
ment manager, did no< accompany
the Indians south, and no substi
tute for the important job was
named, the news chief explained.
According to some reports, a
group of alumni were charged with
overseeing the return of equipment
to Stanford. But Athletic Depart
ment officials say they arc still not
sure who was responsible for the
blunder.
