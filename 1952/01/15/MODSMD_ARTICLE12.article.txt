# Uclan Play 'Commendable' But Lengthy, Repetitious
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
"House in a Sea," a play by
Philip Gleb and Cyril Heiman
and produced by UCLA's stroll
ing Department of Theater Arts,
played a one-night stand on the
stage of the Little Theater last
evening. The result is com
mendable, but falls victim to
length and repetitiousness.
Taking place in Jerusalem in 1946,
when the British were still in con
trol of Palestine, the play explores
the effects on a Jewish family of
a plot to run three Jewish refugee
ships past the British blockade.
Three generations of the family are
vitally involved, and must choose
sides, joining either the uncle, Na
than, who is dedicated to fighting the
British and Arabs, or ihe mother,
who represents home, family, and
security.
Eventually everyone turns
against the niotheV as a traitor,
but not until each character has
been allowed to bang away so
thoroughly at his or her own par
ticular note (hat the piano winds
up shrieking for mercy.
In the first scene of Act 11, for
example, there is absolutely nothing

of importance to be learned which
has not already been well estab
lished in Act I. What the play as a
whole really needs, for that matter,
is a skillful job of cutting and re
organization. It is unfortunate that
the authors failed to do this, for the
play's story, pruned and generally
tightened up, could prove exciting
and powerful, instead of merely sig
nificant in its passive sort of. way.
The acting, by and large, is
good. Stanford's Frank Wolff
turns in a performance as Nathan,
the brother, that is sure, steady,
and highly sympathetic. Louis
C'utelli and Charlotte Freedland
arc delightful hut never coy as
the grandparents.
Juanita E,oupe, on the other hand,
fares less well in the pivotal role
of Calah Sukor, the mother. Ob
viously, she is an accomplished ac
tress, but in this part she seems
miscast. Too often she is the cool,
sophisticated woman of the world,
not often enough the mother of her
grown-up son.
In spite of its faults, however,
'House in a Sea" provided Stanford
with an interesting opportunity to
see what is going on theater-wise
on other campuses. UCLA is to be
commended and thanked for bring
ing its production to town.

lished in Act I. What the play as a
whole really needs, for that matter,
is a skillful job of cutting and re
organization. It is unfortunate that
the authors failed to do this, for the
play's story, pruned and generally
tightened up, could prove exciting
and powerful, instead of merely sig
nificant in its passive sort of. way.
The acting, by and large, is
good. Stanford's Frank Wolff
turns in a performance as Nathan,
the brother, that is sure, steady,
and highly sympathetic. Louis
C'utelli and Charlotte Freedland
arc delightful hut never coy as
the grandparents.
Juanita E,oupe, on the other hand,
fares less well in the pivotal role
of Calah Sukor, the mother. Ob
viously, she is an accomplished ac
tress, but in this part she seems
miscast. Too often she is the cool,
sophisticated woman of the world,
not often enough the mother of her
grown-up son.
In spite of its faults, however,
'House in a Sea" provided Stanford
with an interesting opportunity to
see what is going on theater-wise
on other campuses. UCLA is to be
commended and thanked for bring
ing its production to town.
"House in a Sea," a play by
Philip Gleb and Cyril Heiman
and produced by UCLA's stroll
ing Department of Theater Arts,
played a one-night stand on the
stage of the Little Theater last
evening. The result is com
mendable, but falls victim to
length and repetitiousness.
Taking place in Jerusalem in 1946,
when the British were still in con
trol of Palestine, the play explores
the effects on a Jewish family of
a plot to run three Jewish refugee
ships past the British blockade.
Three generations of the family are
vitally involved, and must choose
sides, joining either the uncle, Na
than, who is dedicated to fighting the
British and Arabs, or ihe mother,
who represents home, family, and
security.
Eventually everyone turns
against the niotheV as a traitor,
but not until each character has
been allowed to bang away so
thoroughly at his or her own par
ticular note (hat the piano winds
up shrieking for mercy.
In the first scene of Act 11, for
example, there is absolutely nothing

of importance to be learned which
has not already been well estab
lished in Act I. What the play as a
whole really needs, for that matter,
