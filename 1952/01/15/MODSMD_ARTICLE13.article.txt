BOSTON, Jan. 14 (UP)—Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. said to
night that "If all the pledges we have received in the last week
materialize. General Eisenhower could be nominated on the first
ballot" at the Republican National Convention.
Lodge, national manager of the Eisenhower-for-President cam-

paign, would not identify any of those
who had pledged or what states they
were from.
He told a press conference that
Eisenhower's job as commander of
the North Atlantic Treaty Forces
"could be terminated before the con
vention." However, if the General
does not resign before the convention
in July Lodge said he "would resign
at once" if nominated.
"He would be accepting the greater
job," Lodge said.
In answer to charges that Eisen
hower could not oppose President
Truman's foreign policy in a presi
dential campaign Lodge said the Gen
eral "has been consistently at vari
ance with what the administration
has done."
For example, Lodge said, Eisen
hower "violently opposed" conces
sions to Soviet Russia during World
War II and demobilization of Ameri
ca's armed forces immediately after
the war.
As Atlantic pact commander Lodge
said Eisenhower had "received only
one-fifth of what he asked for" from
the United States.
