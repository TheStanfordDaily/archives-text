Rain has literally "bogged
down" plans to photograph Stern,
Toyon, and C'rothers men in the
basement of Stern Hall.
Photographic equipment was
set up in Stern's basement last
Saturday to make it more con
venient for the men to he photo
graphed. However, when the
Quad photographer arrived there
yesterday, he found the basement
in two inches of water. The
equipment was taken to the Quad
office, where the pictures will be
taken this week.
