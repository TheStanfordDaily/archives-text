# Air Search Begins

SEATTLE â€” Weather improved
over the North Pacific today and the
greatest air search ever conducted
in the area was organized to hunt
for 4(5 men who abandoned the
7.800-ton freighter Pennsylvania in
a violent storm six days ago.
The Pennsylvania is feared to
have gone to the bottom, the Coast
Guard said. But the air search,
which will continue indefinitely,
"will be the largest ever conducted
in the North Pacific."
The Coast Guard declined to es
timate how many planes would be
used, but said, "You can be assured
we'll use every plane available."
