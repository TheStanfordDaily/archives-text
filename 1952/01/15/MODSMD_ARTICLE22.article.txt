The worst storm in half a century swept over Northern Califor
nia and Nevada yesterday, cutting off all Sierra air, rail, and high
way links between the two states with a deluge of rain and snow.
There was no relief in sight as the Weather Bureau forecast a
new storm moving down from the Gulf of Alaska on the heels

munications between San Francisco
and Santa Cruz, Salinas, Monterey,
and Hollister.
Meanwhile, western Nevada and
the blizzard-ridden Tahoe-Donner
Summit area struggled under the
heaviest snowstorm in half a cen
tury today as the weather man said
bleakly that still more of the para
lyzing white stuff was coming.
Reno itself was all but isolated
with most highways leading in all
directions from the city choked with
snow. The only way out of the city
was eastward on U.S. 40.
U.S. 40 Blocked
U.S. 40 was blocked near Verdi
by a huge landslide, and over the
Donner Summit by the worst bliz
zard the oldest inhabitants could
recall. At least 15 feet of snow war,
reported atop the summit and there
was eight feet of snow in the streets
of Truckee.
The Donner Summit area was
lashed by 50- to 70-mile-an-hour
winds all day, and the U.S. Weather
Bureau station there measured
gusts up to 97 miles an hour.
Veteran highway foremen said
they'd never seen anything like it,
and reported snow-plow crews bat
tling against impossible odds were
trying to reopen the transcontinen -
tal highway. Ten major snow slides
were reported between Donner
Lake Gate and the Summit.

The worst storm in half a century swept over Northern Califor
nia and Nevada yesterday, cutting off all Sierra air, rail, and high
way links between the two states with a deluge of rain and snow.
There was no relief in sight as the Weather Bureau forecast a
new storm moving down from the Gulf of Alaska on the heels

munications between San Francisco
and Santa Cruz, Salinas, Monterey,
and Hollister.
Meanwhile, western Nevada and
the blizzard-ridden Tahoe-Donner
Summit area struggled under the
heaviest snowstorm in half a cen
tury today as the weather man said
bleakly that still more of the para
lyzing white stuff was coming.
Reno itself was all but isolated
with most highways leading in all
directions from the city choked with
snow. The only way out of the city
was eastward on U.S. 40.
U.S. 40 Blocked
U.S. 40 was blocked near Verdi
by a huge landslide, and over the
Donner Summit by the worst bliz
zard the oldest inhabitants could
recall. At least 15 feet of snow war,
reported atop the summit and there
was eight feet of snow in the streets
of Truckee.
The Donner Summit area was
lashed by 50- to 70-mile-an-hour
winds all day, and the U.S. Weather
Bureau station there measured
gusts up to 97 miles an hour.
Veteran highway foremen said
they'd never seen anything like it,

were reported between Donner
Lake Gate and the Summit.
