WASHINGTON â€”Gen. Omar .N
Bradley said today he is "hopeful"
a truce can be reached in Korea but
said Allied negotiators will not
stoop to ;ippcasement that would lay
them open to future Communist
"military blackmail."
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff made the statement as he
went before the Senate Armed
Services Committee to brief mem
bers on worldwide military devel
opments since Congress quit last
October.
He said the United Nations are
seeking peace "by every means at
our command" but added that any
Korean truce must be based on
"sound principles" because "peace
in Korea might well be a pattern for
peace in other trouble spots in the
future."
