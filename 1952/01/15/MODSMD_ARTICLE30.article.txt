# Health Excuse Plan Should Work
## 
### 
The new student health excuse plan passed
Friday by the Academic Council "without ob
jection" constitutes a logical, practical exten
sion of the Honor Code. Under the new set-up,
now in effect, a student who is ill on an exami
nation day (other than a final examination) or
on the day of a lab, can inform his instructor
after the test or lab, have his word accepted,
and take a make-up.
The plan abolishes the old time-consuming
process of waiting at the Health Service for an
excuse certificate, inconveniencing students
and at the same time taking valuable time away
from doctors — time that should be used for
treating persons who are actually ill.
It is something that wouldn't work at all
schools. But it should work here.
There v/as nothing in the previous system
that would guarantee honesty. If a student is
going to be dishonest, it is equally easy where
a health service doctor or an instructor is in
volved, since the student is not actually ill at
the time he requests an excuse.
The plan is not a permanent fixture. It qoes
into effect on an experimental basis for one aca
demic year, and obvious abuse will lead to
discontinuance. Dean 11. Donald Winbigler
and Pete ITalie, chairman of the Student Health

Committee, are confident the plan will succeed,
and there is no reason why it should not.
Should it Le abused, however, serious
pioblems resulting from a high percentage ot
students taking make-up exams would be pre
sented. Consider the system at USC where
make-up tests are the order, where they are
automatic with no questions asked. A stu
dent can study up to the eleventh hour. de
cide he is not completely prepared lor the
test and stay away, with the understanding
that the make-up he laces will be Miller than
the first exam.
USC students havp complained that if the
student studies long enough, he is able to do
much better on the make-up, despite its diffi
culty. This penalizes unfairly those who took
the test (or lab) as scheduled.
And any additional clerical work for instruc
tors, which a high percentage of make-ups
would involve, are to be avoided in that they
distract from an instructor's more serious pur
suits.
There is no reason why the new plan can
not work at a school where the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard aie almost
unique and uriquahtied successes.
What the plan will require is the cooperation
Stanford students have always given. —J M.
