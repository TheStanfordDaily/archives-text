# BULL SESSION

### PETE GROTHE 
ITEMS CROM THE GRAB - BAG. Dick Weisman,
chairman of the Foreign Scholarship Committee and
good guy, passes along the following item. It seems
that a man who says he was a Delt at Missouri went

to the Delt house, gave the
proper handshake, and got into
a long, friendly conversation
with the brothers. Then he
popped the question: "Er . . .
could someone spare a quarter?"

ESCAPE. A bulky tackle on the
football tebm is a hard man to
miss, but in one particular in
stance a tackle was as stealthy
as a gum - shoed second - story

man. During Rose Bowl practice, one of the tackles
suffered a mild concussion and was carted oft to
the Palo Alto Hospital for observation.
Next day, hospital authorities were startled to
find his bed empty. The tackle, tired of being
cooped up, phoned a fraternity brother (also a
football player) for his clothes, then furtively es
caped from the hospital with the loot. The loot in
this case being himself.

ATTENTION, S.P.C.A. Last quarter, a lab instruc
tor in qualitative analysis was startled to see a stu
dent crawl past his knees in hot pursuit of a mouse.
It all started when the student saw a mouse pass
his beaker and decided to chase him. He got his
hand on the rodent, but the mouse took three quick
nips at the palm of his hand, and the real race was
on.
The episode took on the proportions of a Tom
and Jerry cartoon as mouse and man whipped
around the room and the students dropped what
they were doing to witness whether the mouse
was going to fall prey to the poor man's Frank
Buck. The sadistic student finally caught up vvith
the mouse and put him in his beaker. The captor,
duooiing vvith glee, was dissuaded from pouring

hot sulfuric acid on the quivering mouse by some
of his more humane classmates.

ANECDOTES ABOUT ATHLETES. Pat Cannamela
and Les Richter were team-mates on the West
Shrine team, but Les cared for Pat about as much
as the average Stanford student cares for a four
hour final. And the feeling was mutual.
Richter took juicy delight in making fun of Can
namela's already over-publicized looks. Once the
Cal linebacker said light to the SC linebacker's
face, "Say, Pat, is Southern Cal going to buy you
a new nose for graduation?"
A few days later, Cannamela, who is actually a
good guy, was taken away to the Palo Alto Hos
pital with the flu. Richter reckoned that Cannamela
probably looked into the mirror to see how sick he
was, and he remarked to several of the players and
sportswriters, "It's probably the first time that Can
namela had the courage to look at himself in the
mirror."
The West team was eating dinner one night in
the Ueke house, and Richter and USC tailback
Frank Gilford were holding a discussion on the
merits of (he various schools. The serious-minded
Clifford listened to Richter's argument that Cal was
the best school and then countered, "Well, Les,
I believe that when you graduate from Southern
Cal you are a cultured and intelligent man."
At which juncture Cannamela shouted from the
other end of the table, "Hey, pass de buddah, will
ya!"

WITH THE STANFORD TEAM AT ARROW
IIEAD SPRINGS. When it comes to making eyes
at the gurls, Hairy llugasian is no slouch. The
dining room hostess noticed this, and she remarked
to me, "I know who the wolf on this team is . . .
it's that Hungarian or whatever his name is."
Once, Hugasian, asking one of the hotel employees
for a date, was given the answer, "Yes, if you take
my husband and four kids also."
