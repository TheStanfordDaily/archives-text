To the Editor:
I should like to offer a bit of constructive criti
cism if 1 may. Since I have only been at Stanford
lor one quarter 1 am not thoroughly familiar with
its traditions and idiosyncrasies; but there is one
item which is either poor tradition, lack of maturity,
or just plain laziness that could be improved, espe
cially in your peiiodicnl. That is the butchering of
names given to buildings and organizations on the
campus, e.g. Mem Aud, Libe, Lag, Excom, other
corns, etc.
It is hard enough to hear such a word as Libe,
but to see it pointed is worse; and I see no reason
why a little more ink cannot he expended at the

presses to print the name as It should be. I am
still mystified by many expressions found in the
legitimate Stanford vocabulary, and that cannot he
found in any dictionary at my disposal.
If The Daily leads the way, through its influ
ence, this childish slaughter of the English language
could be remedied; although Stanford is a miniature
bureaucracy there is no reason to drag it through
the alphabet soup as happened to our Federal Gov
ernment in Washington, D.C.
These organizations and buildings have proper
names; why not use them?
