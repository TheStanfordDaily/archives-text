(Editor's Note: The following Is
another letter from Phil Nielsen at
the Free University of Berlin which
The Daily will print in two install
ments. Dr. Fritz Epstein, Professor
from the Hoover Library, who has
recently returned fiom Germany,
reported that Stanford Exchange
student Nielsen was making a won
derful impression at the University.
Stanford Daily, Jan, 11.)
The initiative and generosity of the
Stanford International Relief Organi
zation of the I 1.R., which recently of
fered to the Free University, clothing,
book*?, and other essentials, is deeply
appreciated by the Student Govern
ment here.
Because I believe one can gain a
sounder understanding of people by
working with them, I have taken a
job, together with the English stu
dent from Cambridge University
who also lives in the Free Uni
versity's Studcntcnheini, on the
monthly student magazine "Collo
quium."
It is quite obvious that the Ger
mans, so far as this magazine is con
cerned, have a different notion of
what constitutes ' news" than Ameri
cans and British have. The Germans
have a tendency to report relatively

uninteresting statistics and news re
lating to large, impersonal social in
stitutions, instead of expressing opin
ions pointing up social problems or of
describing people and their personal
behavior. The magazine is run by
few students, all of whom are paid,
and it has a more serious character
than student journals in America.
I have the honor to sit on the
Student Government interviewing
boards which examine Free Uni
versity students desiring to study in
the U S A. under the Exchange Pro
gram operated by the Office of the
U.S. High Commissioner for Ger
many (HICOG). These boards at
tempt generally to ascertain how
good the candidates' knowledge of
the Berlin situation is, how active
they have been in leadership activi
ties, how much they know about
problems and history of America,
and how they expect to apply their
experiences in America later to
ward improving life in Germany.
Most of the time my opinion of a
particular candidate is the same as
that held by the German members of
the board, but quite frequently it is
not. The Germans often stand
strongly behind candidates who aca

demically are well-versed in their
fields of study, who are quiet and
serious, and who, in my opinion,
would be more interested in spend
ing a far greater part of their time
studying instead of learning about
American ways and of giving some
thing from themselves about Ger
many.
HICOG has organized regular
meetings all over Germany of Ger
mans who have been to America
under the Exchange Piograin and
are now back home. I have met
with the Berlin group and find here
an interesting situation. Oflieials
in INCOG urge these students to
take an active role in bringing
about changes in educational and
University practices.
These students have in fact many
fruitful ideas, but find it difficult to
know the best way to begin carrying
them out. Some are pessimistic about
possibilities of actual adoption of new
ideas in German Universities which
are heavily burdened by tradition.
The attitude of these "returnees" is
highly significant for Germany's fu
ture, for these students could be a
vanguard to replace old ideas with
newer and more democratic idea 1 : in
German life.
