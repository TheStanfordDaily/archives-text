# Cal Store Prohibits Sale of Red 'News'
## 
### 
Sale of the Moscow - published
magazine "News" has been banned
at the University of California.
The Daily Californian called the
ASUC store committee's act a threat
to the university's academic free
dom.
The "News," which calls itself a
"fortnightly searchlight on world
events," was brought to the store
by a student who was asking for no
profit from its sale. One member
of the store committee pointed out
that if an average member of the
public walked through the store
and saw "News" on sale, he would

assume that the university is full
of Communists.
In an editorial, the Daily Califor
nian states:
"What would John Q. Public
think if ne saw the magazine in the
Store? What would he think if he
saw the library's magazine list?
This same magazine is available
there.
''To be blunt, this whole set of
arguments appears more like fpar
of the witeh hunt, than like sound
reasoning."
(Stanford Union doesn't carry the
magazine, anil has never offered it
for selling purposes.)
