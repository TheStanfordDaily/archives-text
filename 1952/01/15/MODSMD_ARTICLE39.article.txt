# Boxers Will Meet Cal Thursday
## 
### BOB BERNSTEIN 
Stanford's boxing team, their
opening match with Cal just two
clays away, are still without a
puncher in the heavyweight divi
sion. Coach Ray Lunny, in releas
ing the pairings lor Thursday
night's curtain - raiser in Berkeley,
said yesterday that the Card punch
ers will very likely be forced to
forfeit in that division.
Lunny expressed hope that Herb
Cohen, a finalist in last quarter's
intramural tournament, would de
cide to join the varsity ringmen.
Although it is unlikely that Cohen
could be ready to go by Thursday's
ring-time, the San Jose senior might
fill the heavyweight bill in later
matches.
Bill McMahon, the lad who won
over Cohen to take the mural
crown, has worked down to 178
pounds and will battle Cal's Dan
Clawson Thursday.
Three other mural titleholders,
IGS - pounder Tony Wynn, 1112-
pound Bob Chalmers, and 125-
pound Romeo Formentini, will wear
the red against Cal, meeting Fred
Shieman, Ken Hansen ,and Ed Gato
respectively.
Lunny's two experienced hands,
Bob White at 139 pounds and Bob
Baldocchi at 165, both letter-win
ners from last season, will also be
on hand. White battles Myron Han
sen, while Baldocchi takes on Jim
McCann.
The eight-match card is rounded
out by Ed Scurboro, who meets
Bear Jay Slaybaugh at 147 pounds,
and Bill Millington, a transfer from
Long Beach JC, who trades blows
Thursday with Art Hillman of Cal.
Scarboro and Millington are
products of Lunny's autumn quar
ter elementary boxing class, where
both boys showed enough ring sav
vy to merit the starting varsity
berths.
For those making the trip, the
opening gong will be at 8 p.m. in
Cal's Men's Gym, will the For
mentini-Sato go opening the festiv
itiesi
