STELLARTON, N.S. â€”A violent
explosion rockeH a coal mine hero
today and mine officials said 19

Twelve bodies were carried out
of the mine after masked rescue
workers ignored warnings of a pos
sible second blast to continue search
for possible survivors.
The blast occurred at the 1,400-
foot level of the mine. Officials said
the death toll would have been
much greater had not most of the
mine's 300-man working force been
withdrawn when an underground
"heating" was detected along with
a distinct "fire shell."
