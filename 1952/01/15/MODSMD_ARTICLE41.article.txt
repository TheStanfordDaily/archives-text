## Punts and Pitches THIS Is the Year! 
### 
Time now to consider the basketball picture. At this writing, UCLA is
on top of the heap in the Southern Division by virtue of its 3 and 1 record.
Stanford and Cal are tied for second with 2 and 2.
Lei us preface our remarks by venturing the opinion that THIS is
Stanford's year in sports. We won the PCC in football, we'll be third in
the nation in swimming, we may he first or second in the United Stales in
golf, we stand a good chance of winning the CIBA in baseball, and if we
are to <lo anything in basketball. THIS is the year.
The Indians have outstanding personnel in Eddie Tucker, Jim Ramstead,
and Jim Walsh and two real comers in Olie Suzdaleff and Ron Tomsic. In
our mind, coaches don't come better than Bob Burnett. And yet, Stanford,
if it is to pull down a championship this year, has a definite problem to solve.
And stated in its simple terms, it is this: Stanford must either sacrifice height
for shooting power (as it is now doing) or it must sacrifice shooting power
for height.
It was Burnett's plan at the beginning of the year to always have a tall
man at one of the forward slots. The several tryoutees didn't pan out too
well, and Don Carlson, the real hope, forgot to look at his textbooks and
was declared ineligible for scholastic reasons. These factors, coupled with
Tomsk's amazing display of basketball prowess, gave Tomsic the starting
role. Parenthetically, Tomsic has a good chance to break the Stanford all
time varsity scoring record. He has four years in which to do it, whereas
Luisetti and Yardley only had three, and the jut-jawed freshman is off to
a good start.
Tomsic has speed, is a masterful dribbler, and a good shot, but his 5' 11"
don't give him the physical equipment to sweep the backboards. Suzdaleff
is even shorter, and the lithe, darting Tucker is only G' 1". That means that
it is up to Ramstead (0' 5") and Walsh (6' 3") to control the backboards.
And this is a tough order when you consider that there are mooses like
Cal's IVlcKeen ((>' 7") and Gray (6' 7") and USC's Boyd (6' 6").
The other three Southern Division teams have team edges in height,
and Burnett (old us yesterday, "My problem is find some tall reserves who
will help us on the backboards and still not sacrifice our scoring punch to
any appreciable extent. Right now, our reserve strength isn't what I
thought it was at the beginning of the season."
We think that Gary Andrews (6' 4") will help solve the problem and
George Zaninovich shows real promise. Zaninovich, the darling of Delano,
is only (>' 1" but has tremendous spring and drive. He needs to improve on
hir. shots from the outside, but he is unbeatable on fast-break lay-ins.
The Indians are playing a tremendously exciting brand of basketball
this year. They are playing aggressive, hustling ball witli great emphasis
on the fas( break. The '52 Indian team may easily wind up breaking all
scoring records for a Stanford team. The only hitch is (hat the opposition
is finding the basket wi(h flightening frequency also. But it's our opinion
thai the Injun men of bounce are going lo ge( white hot and set the whole
league upon its ears.
There, we said it.

Those who saw Friday night's Cat game will attest to the fact that it was
one of the most exciting, most inartistically and also artistically played, and
poorly-refereed seen on the local hardwood. The Saturday fray at
Berkeley was the same thing in lesser proportions. Cower and Scollins, the
two zebra-shirts, were strictly from hunger.

hir. shots from the outside, but he is unbeatable on fast-break lay-ins.
The Indians are playing a tremendously exciting brand of basketball
this year. They are playing aggressive, hustling ball witli great emphasis
on the fas( break. The '52 Indian team may easily wind up breaking all
scoring records for a Stanford team. The only hitch is (hat the opposition
is finding the basket wi(h flightening frequency also. But it's our opinion
thai the Injun men of bounce are going lo ge( white hot and set the whole
league upon its ears.
There, we said it.

Those who saw Friday night's Cat game will attest to the fact that it was
one of the most exciting, most inartistically and also artistically played, and
poorly-refereed seen on the local hardwood. The Saturday fray at
Berkeley was the same thing in lesser proportions. Cower and Scollins, the
two zebra-shirts, were strictly from hunger.
Time now to consider the basketball picture. At this writing, UCLA is
on top of the heap in the Southern Division by virtue of its 3 and 1 record.
Stanford and Cal are tied for second with 2 and 2.
Lei us preface our remarks by venturing the opinion that THIS is
Stanford's year in sports. We won the PCC in football, we'll be third in
the nation in swimming, we may he first or second in the United Stales in
golf, we stand a good chance of winning the CIBA in baseball, and if we
are to <lo anything in basketball. THIS is the year.
The Indians have outstanding personnel in Eddie Tucker, Jim Ramstead,
and Jim Walsh and two real comers in Olie Suzdaleff and Ron Tomsic. In
our mind, coaches don't come better than Bob Burnett. And yet, Stanford,
if it is to pull down a championship this year, has a definite problem to solve.
And stated in its simple terms, it is this: Stanford must either sacrifice height
for shooting power (as it is now doing) or it must sacrifice shooting power
for height.
It was Burnett's plan at the beginning of the year to always have a tall
man at one of the forward slots. The several tryoutees didn't pan out too
well, and Don Carlson, the real hope, forgot to look at his textbooks and
was declared ineligible for scholastic reasons. These factors, coupled with
Tomsk's amazing display of basketball prowess, gave Tomsic the starting
role. Parenthetically, Tomsic has a good chance to break the Stanford all
time varsity scoring record. He has four years in which to do it, whereas
Luisetti and Yardley only had three, and the jut-jawed freshman is off to
a good start.
Tomsic has speed, is a masterful dribbler, and a good shot, but his 5' 11"
don't give him the physical equipment to sweep the backboards. Suzdaleff
is even shorter, and the lithe, darting Tucker is only G' 1". That means that
it is up to Ramstead (0' 5") and Walsh (6' 3") to control the backboards.
And this is a tough order when you consider that there are mooses like
Cal's IVlcKeen ((>' 7") and Gray (6' 7") and USC's Boyd (6' 6").
The other three Southern Division teams have team edges in height,
and Burnett (old us yesterday, "My problem is find some tall reserves who
will help us on the backboards and still not sacrifice our scoring punch to
any appreciable extent. Right now, our reserve strength isn't what I
thought it was at the beginning of the season."
We think that Gary Andrews (6' 4") will help solve the problem and
George Zaninovich shows real promise. Zaninovich, the darling of Delano,
is only (>' 1" but has tremendous spring and drive. He needs to improve on
hir. shots from the outside, but he is unbeatable on fast-break lay-ins.
