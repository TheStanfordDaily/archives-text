# Luke Lug Full; Opening To Be Set
## 
### 
Because of recent rains, Lake
Lagunita has swollen past the
planned level and is now over
flowing at the boathouse spill
way.
It will be up to Excorn to set the
date for opening the campus' big
swimming hole.
The flume from San Francisquito
Creek, which is the only control
lable supply of water that feeds the
lake, was closed last Friday when
Lag was filled within one and one
half feet of the top. This was the
planned safe height for the lake
this year.
It had been decided to keep the
lake six inches lower than in past
years, because of the weakness of
the banks near f?ohle and Lagunita
Court. When there is too much
pressure on these embankments the
water seeps through them and tends
to flood the suriounding area.
By noon last Saturday the height
of the water was two inches over
the spillway, which had to be wid
ened to handle the overload. This
water came from the uncontrollable
seepage from the hills in back of the
lake, which has increased consid
erably due to the recent storm.
Carl Maier, assistant superintend
ent of engineering in the Buildings
and Grounds Department, said that
with the large amount of rainfall
this year Lake Lagunita should be
available for boating and swimming
up to the end of May and possibly
the end of spring quarter.


NOW FULL—The draught is over for Lake Lagunita, campus boating, swimming, and sun bath
ing center. The once dry lake has been filled to overflowing since last weekend, but an Excom
decision is required before it will be open to the student body.
