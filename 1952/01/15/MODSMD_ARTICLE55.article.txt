# Non-Petition Course Changes End Thursday
## 
### 
Thursday is the last day stu
dents may change their study lists
without petition.
Anyone who changes from one
course to another must have this
change on the study list card in
the Registrar's OfTice. Students
who change sections in one
course, however, do not have to
report these changes to the Reg
istrar.
If a student does not have his
study list changed, he will re
ceive no grade in the course taken
and "no report" in the course
dropped.
