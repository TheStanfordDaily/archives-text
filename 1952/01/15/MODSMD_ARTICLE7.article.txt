# Brave Skipper Spurns Giant N.Y. Welcome

### 
LONDON, Jan. 14 (UP)â€”Capt.
Henrik Kurt Carlsen, hero of the
Flying Enterprise, said today that
he is 'undeserving" of a giant tick
er-tape welcome in New York be
cause he failed to save his ship.
Carlsen said that, in remaining
with the ship for 13 days, he had
done nothing more than any of his
crew would have done had he not
ordered the men to abandon the
crippled vessel.
The modest captain arrived in
London today and was awarded the
Order of the Danish Flag while 2,000
persons broke through police lines
outside the Danish Club to shout
"Hip! Hip! Hooray!" and "Good
show, Carlsen!"
The heroic skipper of the Flying
Enterprise, a Danish-born Ameri
can, received the Order of the Dan
ish Flag from the Danish ambassa
dor, Count Reventlow, in the name
of Denmark's seafaring King Fred
erik.
Carlsen arrived in London early
today from Falmouth en route to
New York and a ticker-tape wel
come which he says he does not
deserve.
"I feel I have not accomplished
anything," the 37-year-old captain
said. "It would have been a differ
ent story if I had brought the Fly
ing Enterprise into port. "As it is,
I just tried to do my duty."
