## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1. r > CUP)
The House overrode economy ad
vocates today and approved a 10 per
cent increase in military pay which
would cost an estimated $832,000,00')
aninually.
1 he vote was 2(1!) to 8!). 130 votes
more than the two-thirds majority
required to pass the measure under
a suspension of the rules.
The measure .'till must be ap
proved by the Senate and signed by
President Truman before it can be
come law. But it was believed that
House passage represented its big
gest hurdle. It was the first major
bill passed by either house in the
new ses: ion.
More Money for All
Increases would range from $7.50
a month for recruits to $114.68 for
some officers of the rank of major
general or above. They would be
come effective on the first day of
the first month after the bill's en- j
actment.
Economy advocates protested
hotly that generals would get an
increase more than 15 times that of
the privates. They said the latter j
need the raise most.
They accused sponsors of the bill |

of bringing it to the floor under a
"gag rule" because it was consid
ered under special procedure that
prohibited amendments.
Will Meet High Prices
Supporters said enlisted men had
ihe raise coming to cover genedally
higher prices. They said nothing
adequately can repay men serving
in Korea.
Under the bill, a married private
with two children would have his
pay boosted from $165 a month to
$181.50. He now gets $80 in basic
pay and $85 quarters allowance for
his dependents. This wotdd be
boosted to $S8 and!).'{.so. Special
allowances for overseas service and
flight pay would not be changed.
The 10 per cent pay boost also
would apply to 152,000 retired offi
cers and men, to cadets in service
academies, and to the Coast Guard,
Public Health Service, and Coast
and Geodetic Survey.
Hep. John Taber (R„ N Y.) pro
tested the procedure and asked that
the House be allowed to consider
the measure later under regular
rules allowing longer debate and
unlimited amendments.

allowances for overseas service and
flight pay would not be changed.
The 10 per cent pay boost also
would apply to 152,000 retired offi
cers and men, to cadets in service
academies, and to the Coast Guard,
Public Health Service, and Coast
and Geodetic Survey.
Hep. John Taber (R„ N Y.) pro
tested the procedure and asked that
the House be allowed to consider
the measure later under regular
rules allowing longer debate and
unlimited amendments.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1. r > CUP)
The House overrode economy ad
vocates today and approved a 10 per
cent increase in military pay which
would cost an estimated $832,000,00')
aninually.
1 he vote was 2(1!) to 8!). 130 votes
more than the two-thirds majority
required to pass the measure under
a suspension of the rules.
The measure .'till must be ap
proved by the Senate and signed by
President Truman before it can be
come law. But it was believed that
House passage represented its big
gest hurdle. It was the first major
bill passed by either house in the
new ses: ion.
More Money for All
Increases would range from $7.50
a month for recruits to $114.68 for
some officers of the rank of major
general or above. They would be
come effective on the first day of
the first month after the bill's en- j
actment.
Economy advocates protested
hotly that generals would get an
increase more than 15 times that of
the privates. They said the latter j
need the raise most.
They accused sponsors of the bill |

of bringing it to the floor under a
"gag rule" because it was consid
ered under special procedure that
prohibited amendments.
Will Meet High Prices
Supporters said enlisted men had
ihe raise coming to cover genedally
higher prices. They said nothing
adequately can repay men serving
in Korea.
Under the bill, a married private
with two children would have his
pay boosted from $165 a month to
$181.50. He now gets $80 in basic
pay and $85 quarters allowance for
his dependents. This wotdd be
boosted to $S8 and!).'{.so. Special
allowances for overseas service and
flight pay would not be changed.
The 10 per cent pay boost also
would apply to 152,000 retired offi
cers and men, to cadets in service
academies, and to the Coast Guard,

and Geodetic Survey.
