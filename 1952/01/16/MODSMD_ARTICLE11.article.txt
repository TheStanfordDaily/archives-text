# Weather Fails to Dampen Rush Spirit; Encina Quiet
## 
### 
As open rushing goes into it3 fifth day, the rushing fever re
mains only slightly dampened by the rain 3. Defying the inclement
weather, parties, dinners, and informal get-togethers sponsored
by both fraternities and eating clubs continue unabated.
Evidence of the continued freshman interest is the fact that

Encina hall this week has been "rela
tively quiet." Encina Commons re
ports 20 per cent fewer students are
eating lunch and dinner meals in the
freshman dining hall.
Already fraternities have reported
anywhere from 3 to 22 pledge pins
accepted by rushees. IFC president
Tony Garrett estimates that the final
pledge card signing next Monday
night in the Nitery will reveal a lotal
of 400 to 450 pledges.
Rushing Outside Encina
Most of the l ushing is being carried
on outside of Encina, where there is
an 11 p.m. curfew for Row and eating
club men. Several Row houses have
made arrangements with bistros on
El Camino or in back of campus
where they nightly extoll the virtues
of their houses to thirsty freshmen.
Garrett, however, urged freshmen
not to forget their studies during this
hectic week, in favor of rushing ac
tivities. He pointed out also that
freshmen should be sure of the house
they want to join before they accept
a pin.
Pledges Binding Monday
No pledges will Ix 3 binding until
the pledge card is signed after next
Monday night's preferential dinners,
but it is hoped that house switching
can be kept to a minimum.
Most freshmen, commented one ob
server, are not, going overboard. One
Western Civ instructor said that the
extra-curricular rushing activities
have had some apparent effect on
freshmen class response, but it has
been slight.
On the Eating club scene, Interclub
Council President Al Sinoty repeated
that the eating club affiliation is en
tirely informal. All man must do
to join an eating club is to indicate
acceptance of an invitation by the
club. There is no formal pledge card
signing.
