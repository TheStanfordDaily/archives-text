# Students 'Lose' Checks, Cellar Loses Money
## 
### 
Officials at the Cellar report that
there are some students on campus
'unworthy of Stanford" who daily
duck past the cashier without paying
their bills.
Cellar Manager Esther Hawkins
claims that the Cellar loses nearly
$10 weekly because of people who
"cheat on their checks."
"We don't expect such antics from
Stanfordites," Mrs. Hawkins said as
she told how some students have
avoided paying for their meals.
"Recently we caught several stu
dents trying to escape full pay
ment by burning holes in their
checks and then claiming they
couldn't tell what the meal price
was," the Cellar manager reported.
"At other times we've found meal
tags shredded in little bits or have
nabbed students scrambling on all
fours in an attempt to sneak past the
cashier," Mrs. Hawkins revealed.
Miss Christine Ricker, who heads
all Union units of which the Cellar
is a part, reports that the Union Board
is considering no action at the mo
ment against wrongdoers.
"We still hope that the students
will abide bv the Fundamental
Standard and the Honor. Code,"
Miss Ricker said.
She warned, however, that action
might be forthcoming if losses in
crease.
She recalled an incident of several
years ago when students misused a
juke-box in the famed campus snack
center only to have it yanked out
without warning by the Union Board.
Though no startling increase in the
number of "walkouts" has been
noted so far this quarter, Cellar offi
cials say that losses balloon toward
the end of the quarter when students
"seem sharp-eyed over the easy
nickel."
According to Miss Rickcr, who
keeps the Cellar's books, dozens of
students skip out daily without pay
ing their coffee bills which total an
"annoying" five or ten cents.
Rut such bill skipping adds up,
Miss Rickcr indicated as she ran her
finger down a column of figures
which showed the Union suffers an
annual average loss of $500 due to
walkouts.
Advising that the Cellar is a non
profit business operated for the stu
dent's convenience, Mrs. Hawkins
points out that the several hundred
dollar loss resulting from "walkouts"
cuts seriously into student funds.
"It hurts especially since we're
teetering between the red and the
black sides of the ledger," Miss Ricker
emphasized.
Summing up, Mrs. Hawkins said,
"It's like having u thief living in your
home."
