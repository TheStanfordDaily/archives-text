# Steady Rain Whips Campus
## 
### 
A steady rain Monday night a rid -
ed .42 inch more precipitation to
an already abnormally high Janu
ary total for this area, and brought
scenes like the one above, showing
"swamp lands" in front of the Law
School, to the campus. Total rain

fall for the current season is 15.52 \
inches.
The total is .83 inch more than 1
the figure for last year at the same
in western Nevada.)
Weekend storms tore down trees I
on campus, threatened telephone
lines and poles, and flooded dormi- ]

lory basements, but resulted in no
serious damage.
The reasonal total rainfall is only
.10 inch below the average end-of-
Junc figure for the last 41 years.

tions elsewhere in California nnd
