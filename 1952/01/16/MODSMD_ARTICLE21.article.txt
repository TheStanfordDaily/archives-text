# Stalin Concedes On Atom Control
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 15 (UP). â€” Premier
I Josef Stalin himself gave the order
for Russia's surprise proposals on
atomic control, a Communist dele
gate informed the United Nations to
day.
Delegate Kuzma V. Kisselev of
Byelorussia said the modification of
the Soviet stand offered in the U.N.
last Friday "flows from the directives
of Josef Stalin."
The Communist delegate, who sits
as an "independent" although Byelo
russia is an integral part of Russia,
accused the West of always digping
up new objections when the Soviets
modify their stand on atomic control.
He particularly attacked the West
ern resolution to relay the Soviet pro- j
posals to the new 12-member dis- '
armament commission, scheduled to
| meet before Feb. 10, as a move to
I give them a "first-class burial."
The Russians last week agreed to
| "continuing" as opposed to "perio
j die" inspection of atom facilities and
also agreed that an atom ban should
go into effect only when a control
I system is in full operation.
