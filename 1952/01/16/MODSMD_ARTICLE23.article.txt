# Tuesday Series Audience Hears Violin, Piano Sonata
## 
### By. RONALD. ROSEN 
The Tuesday Evening Series featured its second musical pro
gram for the school year with Stanford music professors Sandor
Salgo and William L. Crosten performing violin and piano sonata3
by Beethoven, Ratner, and Brahms.

The early Sonata in A major by
Beethoven, a work of infinite charri
and beauty, was somewhat marred
by Salgo's thin tone in the upper reg
isters, especially in the first move
ment. However, the fine musician
ship of both artists contributed to a
performance which was distinguish yd
for balance and interpretation. The
slow movement was quite movingly
played, and the reading of the la.'t
movement matched the* music for
youthful vigor. Crosten's delicat:;
tone and fine technique were in evi
dence throughout.
New Sonata
The new sonata by Leonard Rat
ner of the Stanford Music Depart
ment, is unquestionably a work nH
great talent. Conceived along lines
of the classical and modern Bartok
sonata, it makes great demands upon
the performers, especially in the per
petual-motion-like first movement.
The performance was first-rate, a:;
Salgo's dry tone and Crosten's piar->
part were taut and forceful, which
is what this music demands. The
work was, from the applaute and
comments, very well received. Un
like a great many modern works, it
is very easy to listen to, and is in
every respect a fine contribution to
the contemporary scene.
Late-Romantic Work
As a contrast to the Ratner Sonata,
the late-Romantic Sonata in D minor
by Brahms, was a fine choice to end
the program. The first movement was
played with loving care by both art -
ists. Salgo displayed much better
tone than he did in the Beethoven,
and Crosten never allowed the
melody line to be buried under the
thick harmonies.
The beautiful slow movement, and
the tricky syncopations of the third
movement were played with a maxi •
mum of fine musicianship. The last
movement, however, did not seem to
be played as a cohesive unit by the
artists, but was broken into a series
of smaller sections which weakened
the performance somewhat.
Crosten's piano playing was quiln
colorless in this composition, as hte
lacked real expressiveness and feci •
ing for the music.
The program, on the whole, how
ever, was quite good, and an enthusi -
astic audience received as an encore
the second the Sonatina
by Jean Francaix.

astic audience received as an encore
the second the Sonatina
by Jean Francaix.
The Tuesday Evening Series featured its second musical pro
gram for the school year with Stanford music professors Sandor
Salgo and William L. Crosten performing violin and piano sonata3
by Beethoven, Ratner, and Brahms.

The early Sonata in A major by
Beethoven, a work of infinite charri
and beauty, was somewhat marred
by Salgo's thin tone in the upper reg
isters, especially in the first move
ment. However, the fine musician
ship of both artists contributed to a
performance which was distinguish yd
for balance and interpretation. The
slow movement was quite movingly
played, and the reading of the la.'t
movement matched the* music for
youthful vigor. Crosten's delicat:;
tone and fine technique were in evi
dence throughout.
New Sonata
The new sonata by Leonard Rat
ner of the Stanford Music Depart
ment, is unquestionably a work nH
great talent. Conceived along lines
of the classical and modern Bartok
sonata, it makes great demands upon
the performers, especially in the per
petual-motion-like first movement.
The performance was first-rate, a:;
Salgo's dry tone and Crosten's piar->
part were taut and forceful, which
is what this music demands. The
work was, from the applaute and
comments, very well received. Un
like a great many modern works, it
is very easy to listen to, and is in
every respect a fine contribution to
the contemporary scene.
Late-Romantic Work
As a contrast to the Ratner Sonata,
the late-Romantic Sonata in D minor
by Brahms, was a fine choice to end
the program. The first movement was
played with loving care by both art -
ists. Salgo displayed much better
tone than he did in the Beethoven,
and Crosten never allowed the
melody line to be buried under the
thick harmonies.
The beautiful slow movement, and
the tricky syncopations of the third
movement were played with a maxi •
mum of fine musicianship. The last
movement, however, did not seem to
be played as a cohesive unit by the
artists, but was broken into a series
of smaller sections which weakened
the performance somewhat.
Crosten's piano playing was quiln
colorless in this composition, as hte
lacked real expressiveness and feci •
ing for the music.
The program, on the whole, how
ever, was quite good, and an enthusi -
astic audience received as an encore
the second the Sonatina
