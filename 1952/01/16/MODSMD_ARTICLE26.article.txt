TURNABOUT: A PIJ\Y IN TWO ACTS
ACT I
Scene: The dining room of a fraternity house. The
table is immaculately set with bright white table
cloths, silver plntps, and crystal goblets. The beau
tiful girls are bringing in platters of simmering
steaks. In the brightly lighted room everyone is
smiling and laughing. Ihe room is a picture of easy
grace and good feeling.
The time: Rushing.
Characters: Johnson, a "top" man. He is the
wealthy son of a prominent whiskey tycoon. As the
scene opens, he is looking the house EVot men

1, 2, and 3 are the house's star
rushers.
FRAT MAN 1: Tell me, Johnson,
old man, will you have a third
helping of steak?. Your plate
looks a little bare.
JOHNSON: I don't mind if I do.
FRAT MAN 2: Here, take mine.
I really can't eat all this filet
mignon.
JOHNSON (with mouth full):
Thanks. This steak is . . .

(chomp) . . . really . . . (chomp) good. Do you
eat this way all the time?
I RAT MAN 3: No. I must apologize for tonight. We
usually have mushrooms and cheese sauce but the
cook got sick.
JOHNSON: Oh, that's a shame. Steak isn't really
steak without mushrooms.
FRAT MAN 2: I could drive down into Palo Alto
and get some if you like.
JOHNSON (graciously): No. That won't be neces
sary. I can make it.
FRAT MAN 1: Look. Johnson's champagne glass is
empty. Jeanie, Mary Ann, Nancy, run quick and
get the Chatelier 1928. Johnson's glass is empty.
(A beautiful girl in a low-cut formal rushes up
and fills Johnson's beer mug with pink, bubbling
champagne.)
JOHNSON (with champagne running down the
sides of his mouth): Say, she's kind of cute.
Who is she?
FRAT MAN 3: My fiancee. Would you like to
take her out? She's really very affectionate.
JOHNSON: Sounds okay to me . . . (slurp) . . .
(chomp) . . . You sure you don't mind?
FRAT MAN 3: Certainly not. I'm sure she'd like to
go out with a fellow like you.
FRAT MAN 1: She'd feel privileged. Say, old man,
can I butter you another roll?
FRAT MAN 2: Let me. I've got the butter knife
already in my hand.
FRAT MAN 3: Would you like some jam or caviar
or anything on it?
JOHNSON (with mouth full): Eutter's fine.
FRAT MAN 1: Tell me, Johnson, old man, where
did you get that splendid build? Lift weights or
anything?
JOHNSON: No. Just naturally built, I guess.
FRAT MAN 2: Amazing!
FRAT MAN 3: Astounding!
FRAT MAN 1 (in stage whisper loud enough for
Johnson to hear): This Johnson is really a top
ping fellow.

FRAT MAN 2: I agree.
JOHNSON: Got any more steak?

house. The temporary .plastering on the ceiling
lias fallen. All the tablecloths, silver plates, and

of the medieval axnien-executioners.

row your baseball bat?
FRAT MAN 3: What's wrong with your own?
FRAT MAN 2: I broke it.
FRAT MAN 3: Then by all means take mine. Note
the nails and spikes on the end.
FRAT MAN 2: I've been admiring them . . . (he
bashes Johnson) ... all evening.
JOHNSON (swoons).
FRAT MAN 1: Amazing!
FRAT MAN 3: I hate lo say anything, old man,
but you'd belter correct that slice or youH ruin
your (fame.
FRAT MAN 2: I didn't realize I was doing it. I'll
have to watch more closely next time.
FRAT MAN 1: What shall we da now?
FRAT MAN 3: How about burning bamboo slivers
under the fingernails?
FRAT MAN 2: We did that last night.
FRAT MAN 3: Then what say to a quick round of
the oriental water torture?
FRAT MAN 2: Takes too long. Besides, it hurt's the
house's grade-point average. We've got enough
idiots around here.
JOHNSON (regaining consciousness): Water! Wa
ter!
FRAT MAN 1: Some guys want everything. On
your feet, slug.
JOHNSON: Yes, sir. Right away, sir .
FRAT MAN 2: What do you mean by going to sleep?
JOHNSON: I'm sorry but I couldn't help . . .
FRAT MAN 1 (shouting): No excuses.
FRAT MAN 2 (in loud whisper so Johnson can
hear): How did we ever get a turkey like this
one?
FRAT MAN 3 (sarcastically): Oh, but he's a top
ping fellow.
FRAT MAN i: I agree.
The curtain descends slowly as the lights
on stage dim.
