# PHIL NIELSEN LETTER
## Berlin, Stanford Students Compared 
### 
(Editor's note: This is the second
and last installment of a letter from
Phil Nielsen, former Stanford stu
dent now at the Free University of
Berlin on an exchange scholarship.)
This brings me directly to an oc
casion in which I should like to de
scribe to you the nature of a few of
the problems facing the Student Gov
ernment at the Free University. First,
contact between students is difficult
to achieve. There are, for example,
no living groups whatever; it is what
might be called a "streetcar Univer
sity." Buildings are located over a
wide radius, too. There is, moreover,
no daily student newspaper or really
central bulletin board. Advertising
on behalf of student activities is
looked upon with an almost hostile
air by many students — because of
their traumatic experience under
Hitler—as propaganda: something de
serving liitle attention and something
which brings no good.
No Alumni Support
Secondly, the University is a pub
lic institution supported by the Berlin
City Government and HICOG. Un
known here is the concept of Alumni
financial contributions or support by
pi ivate organizations. There is mani
festly no fee'ing toward "old Alma
Matei" such as results in lasting ties
between students and their univer
sities in America. Students are for
the most pai t mere registration num
bers in the University and it is of no
particular interest to the University
whether a student passes or fails his
c xams or what he does as an individ
ual.
Student Finances
Thirdly, there is a great short
age of money among students.
Many activities whi« h we now com
monly carry on at Stanford, would
he out of the question here because
no one could afford to attend. And
th» University has not enough in
come to subsidize free affairs.
Numerous student government
functions are directed solely towaid
obtaining reduced prices for stu
dents for such things as news
papers, train and airplane fares,
theater tickets and meals.

Fourthly, there is a fear of par
ticipation in activities. On account of
tragic experiences under political
charlatans in public political life in
recent German history, which has
apparently demonstrated the imper
manence of political values, many
students disdain from participating in
any sort of organized University
group-activity. They believe that
perhaps the leading political or stu
dent organizations of today will to
morrow be subverted with terrible
consequences for those who were
members.
Fear Hinders Students
Next, fear hinders student leaders
in carrying out projects drawing pub
lic attention, liiose in leading posi
tions in the student government who
are political refugees and whose par
ents stiil remain in the Soviet Zone,
fear that any significant achieve
ments they might make in Berlin in
democratic affairs would result in the
Russians' harming their parents.
For example, when the Northwest
German Radio Company recently in
terviewed us along with the student
director of Foreign Relations, this
student leader specifically requested
before the broadcast (which would
be beamed into the Soviet Zone) that
his name not be mentioned as his par
ents are still in the Zone.
Student Government
Sixth, a limited number of stu
dents in fact run (he Student Gov
ernment and there is an accom
panying tendency not to change
personnel. All those working for the
more important Executive Branch
receive salaries from which they
exist. There is naturally little de
sire to relinquish these |H»sls and
their assured incomes over time, so
those outside the gioup in office feel
often that the system is closed and
regard the leaders as paid Univer
sity employees, not as their student
representatives. As already ex
plained, the University has a limit
ed budget and not enough funds to
hire more student woikers.
In addition, there is some ground
for believing that tliow in control
would prefer no assistance, out of
jealousy that they might loce prestige

or some of their responsibility to
others. It must be said, too, that there
is not much interest in the part of
the student body to work voluntarily
without pay in student projects.
Practically all must spend a few hours
a day themselves working to earn
their daily bread.
Lastly, toward student politics
there is among students a certain de
gree of apathy based on the tradi
tional German philosophy that poli
tics are made only by political lead
ers and parties, not by the people.
Constantly one hears students grum
bling over decisions or organization
of tlie Student Government, but they
aie of the opinion that they them
selves have no influence whatever on
their Student Government. This
philosophy is important to bear in
mind in all observations of German
political behavior.
Problems Serious
I believe these problems are ser
ious ami steps should be taken to
alter the attitude of inind and the
physical hindrances. Ifn< it will
definitely not he simple. We should
never forget, at the same time, that
(he Student Government at the
Free University has undoubtedly
the most power of any in Germany
and in the whole resl of the world,
for its representatives sit on such
groups as we in America would
designate as Board of Trustees,
Registrar's Committee of Admis
sions, and University Scholarship
Committee and every other high
University administrative body.
Besides founding this University,
much has already been accomplished
by the students and I must say they
certainly have a seriousness of pur
pose and a sense of standing up and
lighting with everything they have for
democracy. When achievements in
this direction are won at such effort
and cost, they are not easily relin
quished. We should be grateful that
indeed such an outpost for freedom
exists behind the Iron Curtain.
I wish you all the best for continued
success in your work and my deepest
regards to you nil.

personnel. All those working for the
more important Executive Branch
receive salaries from which they
exist. There is naturally little de
sire to relinquish these |H»sls and
their assured incomes over time, so
those outside the gioup in office feel
often that the system is closed and
regard the leaders as paid Univer
sity employees, not as their student
representatives. As already ex
plained, the University has a limit
ed budget and not enough funds to
hire more student woikers.
In addition, there is some ground
for believing that tliow in control
would prefer no assistance, out of
jealousy that they might loce prestige

or some of their responsibility to
others. It must be said, too, that there
is not much interest in the part of
the student body to work voluntarily
without pay in student projects.
Practically all must spend a few hours
a day themselves working to earn
their daily bread.
Lastly, toward student politics
there is among students a certain de
gree of apathy based on the tradi
tional German philosophy that poli
tics are made only by political lead
ers and parties, not by the people.
Constantly one hears students grum
bling over decisions or organization
of tlie Student Government, but they
aie of the opinion that they them

their Student Government. This
philosophy is important to bear in
mind in all observations of German
political behavior.
Problems Serious
I believe these problems are ser
ious ami steps should be taken to
alter the attitude of inind and the
physical hindrances. Ifn< it will

never forget, at the same time, that
(he Student Government at the
Free University has undoubtedly
the most power of any in Germany
and in the whole resl of the world,
for its representatives sit on such
groups as we in America would
designate as Board of Trustees,
Registrar's Committee of Admis
sions, and University Scholarship
Committee and every other high
University administrative body.
Besides founding this University,
much has already been accomplished
by the students and I must say they
certainly have a seriousness of pur
pose and a sense of standing up and
lighting with everything they have for
democracy. When achievements in
this direction are won at such effort
and cost, they are not easily relin

(Editor's note: This is the second
and last installment of a letter from
Phil Nielsen, former Stanford stu
dent now at the Free University of
Berlin on an exchange scholarship.)
This brings me directly to an oc
casion in which I should like to de
scribe to you the nature of a few of
the problems facing the Student Gov
ernment at the Free University. First,
contact between students is difficult
to achieve. There are, for example,
no living groups whatever; it is what
might be called a "streetcar Univer
sity." Buildings are located over a
wide radius, too. There is, moreover,
no daily student newspaper or really
central bulletin board. Advertising
on behalf of student activities is
looked upon with an almost hostile
air by many students — because of
their traumatic experience under
Hitler—as propaganda: something de
serving liitle attention and something
which brings no good.
No Alumni Support
Secondly, the University is a pub
lic institution supported by the Berlin
City Government and HICOG. Un
known here is the concept of Alumni
financial contributions or support by
pi ivate organizations. There is mani
festly no fee'ing toward "old Alma
Matei" such as results in lasting ties
between students and their univer
sities in America. Students are for
the most pai t mere registration num
bers in the University and it is of no
particular interest to the University
whether a student passes or fails his
c xams or what he does as an individ
ual.
Student Finances
Thirdly, there is a great short
age of money among students.
Many activities whi« h we now com
monly carry on at Stanford, would
he out of the question here because
no one could afford to attend. And
th» University has not enough in
come to subsidize free affairs.
Numerous student government
functions are directed solely towaid
obtaining reduced prices for stu
dents for such things as news
papers, train and airplane fares,
theater tickets and meals.

Fourthly, there is a fear of par
ticipation in activities. On account of
tragic experiences under political
charlatans in public political life in
recent German history, which has
apparently demonstrated the imper
manence of political values, many
students disdain from participating in
any sort of organized University
group-activity. They believe that
perhaps the leading political or stu
dent organizations of today will to
morrow be subverted with terrible
consequences for those who were
members.
Fear Hinders Students
Next, fear hinders student leaders
in carrying out projects drawing pub
lic attention, liiose in leading posi
tions in the student government who
are political refugees and whose par
ents stiil remain in the Soviet Zone,
fear that any significant achieve
ments they might make in Berlin in
democratic affairs would result in the
Russians' harming their parents.
For example, when the Northwest
German Radio Company recently in
terviewed us along with the student
director of Foreign Relations, this
student leader specifically requested
before the broadcast (which would
be beamed into the Soviet Zone) that
his name not be mentioned as his par
ents are still in the Zone.
Student Government
Sixth, a limited number of stu
dents in fact run (he Student Gov
ernment and there is an accom
panying tendency not to change
personnel. All those working for the
more important Executive Branch
receive salaries from which they
exist. There is naturally little de

on behalf of student activities is
looked upon with an almost hostile
air by many students — because of
their traumatic experience under
Hitler—as propaganda: something de
serving liitle attention and something
which brings no good.
No Alumni Support
Secondly, the University is a pub
lic institution supported by the Berlin
City Government and HICOG. Un
known here is the concept of Alumni
financial contributions or support by
pi ivate organizations. There is mani
festly no fee'ing toward "old Alma
Matei" such as results in lasting ties
between students and their univer
sities in America. Students are for
the most pai t mere registration num
bers in the University and it is of no
particular interest to the University
whether a student passes or fails his
c xams or what he does as an individ
ual.
Student Finances
Thirdly, there is a great short
age of money among students.
Many activities whi« h we now com
monly carry on at Stanford, would
he out of the question here because
no one could afford to attend. And
th» University has not enough in
come to subsidize free affairs.
Numerous student government
functions are directed solely towaid
obtaining reduced prices for stu
dents for such things as news
papers, train and airplane fares,
theater tickets and meals.

Fourthly, there is a fear of par
ticipation in activities. On account of
tragic experiences under political
charlatans in public political life in
recent German history, which has
apparently demonstrated the imper
manence of political values, many
students disdain from participating in
any sort of organized University
group-activity. They believe that
perhaps the leading political or stu
dent organizations of today will to
morrow be subverted with terrible
consequences for those who were
members.
Fear Hinders Students
Next, fear hinders student leaders
in carrying out projects drawing pub
lic attention, liiose in leading posi
tions in the student government who
are political refugees and whose par
ents stiil remain in the Soviet Zone,
fear that any significant achieve
ments they might make in Berlin in
democratic affairs would result in the
Russians' harming their parents.
For example, when the Northwest
German Radio Company recently in
terviewed us along with the student
director of Foreign Relations, this
student leader specifically requested
before the broadcast (which would
be beamed into the Soviet Zone) that
his name not be mentioned as his par
ents are still in the Zone.
Student Government
Sixth, a limited number of stu
dents in fact run (he Student Gov
ernment and there is an accom
panying tendency not to change
personnel. All those working for the
more important Executive Branch
receive salaries from which they
exist. There is naturally little de
sire to relinquish these |H»sls and
their assured incomes over time, so
those outside the gioup in office feel
often that the system is closed and
regard the leaders as paid Univer
sity employees, not as their student
representatives. As already ex
plained, the University has a limit
ed budget and not enough funds to
hire more student woikers.
In addition, there is some ground
for believing that tliow in control
would prefer no assistance, out of
jealousy that they might loce prestige

or some of their responsibility to
others. It must be said, too, that there
is not much interest in the part of
the student body to work voluntarily
without pay in student projects.
Practically all must spend a few hours
a day themselves working to earn
their daily bread.
Lastly, toward student politics
there is among students a certain de
gree of apathy based on the tradi
tional German philosophy that poli
tics are made only by political lead
ers and parties, not by the people.
Constantly one hears students grum
bling over decisions or organization
of tlie Student Government, but they
aie of the opinion that they them
selves have no influence whatever on
their Student Government. This
philosophy is important to bear in
mind in all observations of German
political behavior.
Problems Serious
I believe these problems are ser
ious ami steps should be taken to
alter the attitude of inind and the
physical hindrances. Ifn< it will
definitely not he simple. We should
never forget, at the same time, that
(he Student Government at the
Free University has undoubtedly
the most power of any in Germany
and in the whole resl of the world,
for its representatives sit on such
groups as we in America would
designate as Board of Trustees,
Registrar's Committee of Admis
sions, and University Scholarship
Committee and every other high
University administrative body.
Besides founding this University,
much has already been accomplished
by the students and I must say they
certainly have a seriousness of pur
pose and a sense of standing up and
lighting with everything they have for
democracy. When achievements in
this direction are won at such effort
and cost, they are not easily relin
quished. We should be grateful that
indeed such an outpost for freedom
exists behind the Iron Curtain.
I wish you all the best for continued
success in your work and my deepest
