# PRO AND CAHN

### 
This morning, with tongue somewhat in cheek, we advocate making
college football professional. Now hold on a minute, we haven't lost
all our marbles. Read on just out of sympathy and respect.
We have noted a great deal in the papers' concerning the de-emphasis
ol football. The mo ;t recent step being the order ol the NCAA to chop
jpring practice from thirty days to twenty. To us this curtailment seems
rather trivial in the light of all the discussion that has been carried on
about over-emphasis. And this talk is justified.
GONE ARE DAYS OF RECREATIONAL FOOTBALL
Football today is no longer a game, but a coldhearted, money-con
seiou , competitive business. And the saddest part is that the day is gone
when recreation and sportsmanship are placed above the almighty dollar.
Let's face it, the nation's universities won't willingly or collectively agree
to tone down football, because football is a tremendous money-maker.
'Ibis transition of football from a game to u business has likewise
switched us from a mild conservative to a radical, advocating that col
lege football should be made professional. Apparently de-emphasis is
out, so why not get off the picket fence and go whole hog by making
coiiege football an open play-for-pay proposition?
There is no getting away from the fact that every university of any
football note whatsoever aids its players in one manner or another. Here
at Stanford the Buck of the Month Club and scholarships defray the tui
tion of many a football player. At other schools similar means are used.
In ;:ume instances outright gifts are dangled in the faces of high school
athletes to induce them to attend that particular university.
Why not make the paying of athletes legal throughout the nation?
Each university would have a salary scale of its own. Perhaps footballers'
tuition charges could he waived. This would have the same result but not
the same implication as paying cold cash for the services of a star guard
for four, years. Those universities with high football aspirations and
equally fat purses would lure the better players. Others would play
lootball in their own class of competition.
NEVADA DID IT WITII SILVER DOLLARS
It's been tried. Following the war, the University of Nevada, in the
days ol Stan Heatli, openly paid its players. No punches pulled, they
came out and admitted paying their hoys. And you know how they
raised the money for such a venture? The little quiet community of
Reno gladly pitched in and raised sufficient funds. A sort of local
pride. That's the way the college plan could be financed.
Football financial worries would no longer be left solely to the alumni
.ind athletic departments. Rather, it would be the alumni working to
gether with the community to put the local entry on top of the footballing
nation. It worked at Nevada until no player would come out to the
middle of the desert regardless of the silver dollars and jackpots offered
by Reno's "civic-minded citizens."
UNIVERSITY PURPOSE OVERSHADOWED BY FOOTBALL
Granted this may be a radical suggestion. But facing the fact that col
lege football is definitely out of line with the purpose of a university,
and won't get back in step, why not bring college football payoffs right
out into the open? Everyone realizes that schools which have consistently
better grid teams ofTer their players just a little more in the way of mate
rial gain than those schools which are maintaining so-called standards—
standards which may be the result of just not enough money to lure the
stars.
The mushrooming growth of football has done its damage to the game
o ; well as to the institutions where it v/as born and babied. It has con
quered its master, and a modern Frankenstein monster is upon us.
The incessant desire to win has resulted in the use of as much man
power as possible, and it isn't just to see everyone get into the game.
Sin'.'e Army founded platoon football, the switching of offensive and de
fen: ive units has been used by others seeking grid glory, provided they
have the material. Most schools don't have the material, and the result
has been the dropping of football by small schools such as St. Mary's and
USF. That's a pity and a shame, but the situation won't get better because
the schools making money just don't want to stop making it. And that
means no de-emphasis of football.
So let's forget de-emphasis and iust pay the footballers a salary.
The schools with the most in the old treasury and the right kind of
following would get the players. It sounds hard and cold, but football
is a business and a competitive one. Remember football gate receipts,
at this institution and a majority of others, support all other athletics.
Good football at large universities is necessary as a form of revenue,
and good football which attracts crowds is played only with good play
ers. In turn the price of good players is high. These prices are being
paid by many universities, bill in an under-the-table way. As long as
football apparently can never be taken back to iust a Saturday afternoon
game, we suggest going to the other extreme and making college foot
ball professional.

quered its master, and a modern Frankenstein monster is upon us.
The incessant desire to win has resulted in the use of as much man
power as possible, and it isn't just to see everyone get into the game.
Sin'.'e Army founded platoon football, the switching of offensive and de
fen: ive units has been used by others seeking grid glory, provided they
have the material. Most schools don't have the material, and the result
has been the dropping of football by small schools such as St. Mary's and
USF. That's a pity and a shame, but the situation won't get better because
the schools making money just don't want to stop making it. And that
means no de-emphasis of football.
So let's forget de-emphasis and iust pay the footballers a salary.
The schools with the most in the old treasury and the right kind of
following would get the players. It sounds hard and cold, but football
is a business and a competitive one. Remember football gate receipts,
at this institution and a majority of others, support all other athletics.
Good football at large universities is necessary as a form of revenue,
and good football which attracts crowds is played only with good play
ers. In turn the price of good players is high. These prices are being
paid by many universities, bill in an under-the-table way. As long as
football apparently can never be taken back to iust a Saturday afternoon
game, we suggest going to the other extreme and making college foot
ball professional.

This morning, with tongue somewhat in cheek, we advocate making
college football professional. Now hold on a minute, we haven't lost
all our marbles. Read on just out of sympathy and respect.
We have noted a great deal in the papers' concerning the de-emphasis
ol football. The mo ;t recent step being the order ol the NCAA to chop
jpring practice from thirty days to twenty. To us this curtailment seems
rather trivial in the light of all the discussion that has been carried on
about over-emphasis. And this talk is justified.
GONE ARE DAYS OF RECREATIONAL FOOTBALL
Football today is no longer a game, but a coldhearted, money-con
seiou , competitive business. And the saddest part is that the day is gone
when recreation and sportsmanship are placed above the almighty dollar.
Let's face it, the nation's universities won't willingly or collectively agree
to tone down football, because football is a tremendous money-maker.
'Ibis transition of football from a game to u business has likewise
switched us from a mild conservative to a radical, advocating that col
lege football should be made professional. Apparently de-emphasis is
out, so why not get off the picket fence and go whole hog by making
coiiege football an open play-for-pay proposition?
There is no getting away from the fact that every university of any
football note whatsoever aids its players in one manner or another. Here
at Stanford the Buck of the Month Club and scholarships defray the tui
tion of many a football player. At other schools similar means are used.
In ;:ume instances outright gifts are dangled in the faces of high school
athletes to induce them to attend that particular university.
Why not make the paying of athletes legal throughout the nation?
Each university would have a salary scale of its own. Perhaps footballers'
tuition charges could he waived. This would have the same result but not
the same implication as paying cold cash for the services of a star guard
for four, years. Those universities with high football aspirations and
equally fat purses would lure the better players. Others would play
lootball in their own class of competition.
NEVADA DID IT WITII SILVER DOLLARS
It's been tried. Following the war, the University of Nevada, in the
days ol Stan Heatli, openly paid its players. No punches pulled, they
came out and admitted paying their hoys. And you know how they
raised the money for such a venture? The little quiet community of
Reno gladly pitched in and raised sufficient funds. A sort of local
pride. That's the way the college plan could be financed.
Football financial worries would no longer be left solely to the alumni
.ind athletic departments. Rather, it would be the alumni working to
gether with the community to put the local entry on top of the footballing
nation. It worked at Nevada until no player would come out to the
middle of the desert regardless of the silver dollars and jackpots offered
by Reno's "civic-minded citizens."
UNIVERSITY PURPOSE OVERSHADOWED BY FOOTBALL
Granted this may be a radical suggestion. But facing the fact that col
lege football is definitely out of line with the purpose of a university,
and won't get back in step, why not bring college football payoffs right
out into the open? Everyone realizes that schools which have consistently
better grid teams ofTer their players just a little more in the way of mate
rial gain than those schools which are maintaining so-called standards—
standards which may be the result of just not enough money to lure the
stars.

NEVADA DID IT WITII SILVER DOLLARS
It's been tried. Following the war, the University of Nevada, in the
days ol Stan Heatli, openly paid its players. No punches pulled, they
came out and admitted paying their hoys. And you know how they
raised the money for such a venture? The little quiet community of
Reno gladly pitched in and raised sufficient funds. A sort of local
pride. That's the way the college plan could be financed.
Football financial worries would no longer be left solely to the alumni
.ind athletic departments. Rather, it would be the alumni working to
gether with the community to put the local entry on top of the footballing
nation. It worked at Nevada until no player would come out to the
middle of the desert regardless of the silver dollars and jackpots offered
by Reno's "civic-minded citizens."
UNIVERSITY PURPOSE OVERSHADOWED BY FOOTBALL
Granted this may be a radical suggestion. But facing the fact that col
lege football is definitely out of line with the purpose of a university,
and won't get back in step, why not bring college football payoffs right
out into the open? Everyone realizes that schools which have consistently
better grid teams ofTer their players just a little more in the way of mate
rial gain than those schools which are maintaining so-called standards—
standards which may be the result of just not enough money to lure the
stars.
The mushrooming growth of football has done its damage to the game
o ; well as to the institutions where it v/as born and babied. It has con
quered its master, and a modern Frankenstein monster is upon us.
The incessant desire to win has resulted in the use of as much man
power as possible, and it isn't just to see everyone get into the game.
Sin'.'e Army founded platoon football, the switching of offensive and de
fen: ive units has been used by others seeking grid glory, provided they
have the material. Most schools don't have the material, and the result
has been the dropping of football by small schools such as St. Mary's and
USF. That's a pity and a shame, but the situation won't get better because
the schools making money just don't want to stop making it. And that
means no de-emphasis of football.
So let's forget de-emphasis and iust pay the footballers a salary.
The schools with the most in the old treasury and the right kind of
following would get the players. It sounds hard and cold, but football
is a business and a competitive one. Remember football gate receipts,
at this institution and a majority of others, support all other athletics.
Good football at large universities is necessary as a form of revenue,
and good football which attracts crowds is played only with good play
ers. In turn the price of good players is high. These prices are being
paid by many universities, bill in an under-the-table way. As long as
football apparently can never be taken back to iust a Saturday afternoon
game, we suggest going to the other extreme and making college foot
ball professional.

This morning, with tongue somewhat in cheek, we advocate making
college football professional. Now hold on a minute, we haven't lost
all our marbles. Read on just out of sympathy and respect.
We have noted a great deal in the papers' concerning the de-emphasis
ol football. The mo ;t recent step being the order ol the NCAA to chop
jpring practice from thirty days to twenty. To us this curtailment seems
rather trivial in the light of all the discussion that has been carried on
about over-emphasis. And this talk is justified.
GONE ARE DAYS OF RECREATIONAL FOOTBALL
Football today is no longer a game, but a coldhearted, money-con
seiou , competitive business. And the saddest part is that the day is gone
when recreation and sportsmanship are placed above the almighty dollar.
Let's face it, the nation's universities won't willingly or collectively agree
to tone down football, because football is a tremendous money-maker.
'Ibis transition of football from a game to u business has likewise
switched us from a mild conservative to a radical, advocating that col
lege football should be made professional. Apparently de-emphasis is
out, so why not get off the picket fence and go whole hog by making
coiiege football an open play-for-pay proposition?
There is no getting away from the fact that every university of any
football note whatsoever aids its players in one manner or another. Here
at Stanford the Buck of the Month Club and scholarships defray the tui
tion of many a football player. At other schools similar means are used.
In ;:ume instances outright gifts are dangled in the faces of high school
athletes to induce them to attend that particular university.
Why not make the paying of athletes legal throughout the nation?
Each university would have a salary scale of its own. Perhaps footballers'
tuition charges could he waived. This would have the same result but not
the same implication as paying cold cash for the services of a star guard
for four, years. Those universities with high football aspirations and
equally fat purses would lure the better players. Others would play
lootball in their own class of competition.
