## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's wrestling team opens
its season tonight with a match
against the Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion. Tomorrow night they meet Cal
in a preliminary to the boxing meet.
Both meets will be away.
The wrestlers, piloted by student
coach Don Williams, are strong in
the heavier divisions but lack depth
in the lighter weight classes. Two
varsity loolball players, Phil Wilson
and Hod Garner, will vie for the
number one heavyweight berth.
Wilson will wrestle tonight and
Garner will get the nod against the
Bears.
Jack Oglesby, a veteran of two
years' experience, will wrestle in
the 175-pound class, and Pal Mad
den, a freshman, will start in the
165 - pound division. In the 157-
pound class, Ken James will wrestle
tonight and Bruce Bailey, a fresh
man, will go tomorrow.
Hob Jessen and Art Alexander, a
pair of freshmen, will wrestle in
the 147- and 137-pound classes re
spectively. Alexander is filling in
lor George Russell, who is unable
to compete for the first few meets.
The 130-pound class will be con
siderably weakened by the loss of
Dave Wong and Olivr Lyons. Lyons
is out with a wrenched shoulder and
Bob Neighbors, a boy with com
paratively little experience, will
wrestle in his place.
Coach Williams will be forced to
post a forfeit in the 123-pound class
because of a vacancy existing there.
The Alameda team, coached by
Hub Farley, will be expected to give
the Cards an extremely rough time.
They are in exceptionally fine con
dition ,mainly because of the fact
that their training season is never
interrupted by vacations.
Coach Henry Stone's Bear wres
tlers are undefeated in four outings,
and are co-defending Coast champs.
They will line up as follows: Julian
Sanders (1.10), Ray Castenada (137),
Eugene Theios (147), Dick Witt
(157), Hob Hanke or Bob Gibbel
(167), Bently Lyon (175), and Ray

dition ,mainly because of the fact

tlers are undefeated in four outings,
and are co-defending Coast champs.
They will line up as follows: Julian
Sanders (1.10), Ray Castenada (137),

Stanford's wrestling team opens
its season tonight with a match
against the Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion. Tomorrow night they meet Cal
in a preliminary to the boxing meet.
Both meets will be away.
The wrestlers, piloted by student
coach Don Williams, are strong in
the heavier divisions but lack depth
in the lighter weight classes. Two
varsity loolball players, Phil Wilson
and Hod Garner, will vie for the
number one heavyweight berth.
Wilson will wrestle tonight and
Garner will get the nod against the
Bears.
Jack Oglesby, a veteran of two
years' experience, will wrestle in
the 175-pound class, and Pal Mad
den, a freshman, will start in the
165 - pound division. In the 157-
pound class, Ken James will wrestle
tonight and Bruce Bailey, a fresh
man, will go tomorrow.
Hob Jessen and Art Alexander, a
pair of freshmen, will wrestle in
the 147- and 137-pound classes re
spectively. Alexander is filling in
lor George Russell, who is unable
to compete for the first few meets.
The 130-pound class will be con
siderably weakened by the loss of
Dave Wong and Olivr Lyons. Lyons
is out with a wrenched shoulder and
Bob Neighbors, a boy with com
paratively little experience, will
wrestle in his place.
Coach Williams will be forced to
post a forfeit in the 123-pound class
