BIG AND RUGGED—is USC's husky center Bob Boyd. Boyd, a 21-year-old senior, packs 220
pounds on a G' 6" frame. He has been the Trojans' leading point-getter this year as he has scored
57 points in four conference games for a 14.3 average. This mark puts him fourth in the league
behind Stanford's Ed Tucker and Jim Ramstead, and Jim Doan of Cal. Boyd is a graduate of Al
hambra High.
