New products mean new opportunities
for chemical engineers

[ FIRST OF A SERIES ]

To you as a student chemical engi
neer, what does this statement bring
to mind:
Nearly two-thirds of l)u Pout's cur
rent sales are in products entirely
or virtually unknown in
Likely it suggests years of solving
intriguing engineering problems, the
designing of unique equipment, the
carrying out of reactions under ex
traordinary conditions.
Hut it should also suggest the op
portunities that will come to chemi
cal engineers in the future. For at
Du Pont, new and better products
are continually being developed.
From today's extended program of
fundamental research you can expect
more neoprenes, more nylons, more
plastics like "Teflon" tetrafluoro
cthylene resin.
As these products come out of the
laboratory, they will bring with them
a succession of interesting and chal
lenging probloms for the chemical
engineer. Problems that will arise
out of their very newness.
For instance, take nylon, the first

wholly synthetic organic fiber. Tn
working out techniques for its com
mercial manufacture, there was
practically nothing to go on. The
compounds of which it was made,
hexamethylenediamine and adipic
acid, were essentially laboratory
chemicals. Processes had to be de
vised to make them from cheap raw
materials—benzene, hydrogen, air
and ammonia. Large-scale prepara
tion of nylon salt from amine and
acid required going beyond the clas
sical unit operations.
Here for the first time it was pro
posed to extrude a fiber with extreme
accuracy from a melted polymer at
290° C. At this temperature the poly
mer decomposes slowly. It had to be
melted, pumped at 5000 p.s.i. pres
sure through microscopic holes and
cooled in a hurry. Otherwise the fiber
would emerge discolored.
The Du Pont chemical and me
chanical engineers and other men
and women who worked with them
ran into one difficulty after another.
More than once they thought that the

project would have to he abandoned.
However, it. is basic in l)u I'out
people's philosophy not only to take
on difficult pioneering problems, but
to see them through. With nylon,
this persistence paid off handsomely.
Is this the kind of problem you'd
like to attack, the kind of people
you'd like to work with?
NEXT MONTH - Opportunities for
chemical engineers in research and de
velopment will he discussed in the sec
ond article in this series. Watch for it!
