Coast Guard in Search
The Coast Guard PBM was to arrive
at the search scene at dawn tomorrow
to relocate the two lifeboats and two
remaining lifeboats. The cutter Yo
cona, speeding north from Eureka,
Calif., was to join the cutter Klamath

The ship was ordered abandoned
by Capt. George P. Plover, Portland,

a 14-foot crack in her hull and sent
"mountainous" waves crashing over
her decks. The skipper radioed that
the crew was taking to four lifeboats.
No trace has been found of the ship or
her crew.
