# Marooned Train Awaiting Reseue
## 
### 
DUTCH FLAT, lan. 15 (UP)â€”
Rescue trains and relief teams
inched up the slopes of the
Sierras toward the marooned
streamliner City of San Fran
cisco tonight as 222 passengers,
some of them ill, huddled in
blankets to wait out their ordeal.
The sleek, yellow-painted train,
pride of the Southern Pacific's San
Francisco - Chicago run, has been
] bogged down since noon Sunday in
14-foot snowdrifts a few miles west
of Donner Summit, the rim of the
Sierras.
The train ran out of fuel late yes
terday and since that time its 196
passengers and 30 crewmen have
been without heat except for a mea
ger flicker from the coal-burning
kitchen range in the diner.
Four passengers, a civilian and
three young servicemen, were re
moved from the stranded luxury
train and taken to Nyack Lodge,
five miles away, in a snow tractor
as an "experimental rescue."
The four said that quite a few of
the passengers, "possibly 27 or . n >o,"
were overcome during the night.
They said the trouble was presumed
to be lack of oxygen due to the
fact that the train had been tightly
closed since early yesterday to keep
out the cold.
A snowplow pushing up the in
visible rails from Truckee, on the
Nevada side of the summit, finally
was forced to surrender to the ele
ments and return to Norden after
pushing a mere seven miles all day.
At the orders of Gov. Earl War
ren, the California National Guard
stood ready tonight to aid in the
rescue of 222 persons trapped on
board the City of San Francisco.
