## Persons on Snowbound Train Hustled to Safety 
### 
EMIGRANT GAP, Calif*, Jan. 16 (UP)â€”All 223 persons v/erc
removed from the snowbound streamliner Cily of San Francisco
at 9:30 p.m. PST today after being marooned three days and nights
in the high Sierras.
The dramatic rescue operation was completed after snow plows

crashed through huge drifts to the
train along the highway late this
morning. An emergency licet of au
tomobiles and trucks hustled the
shivering men, women, and chil
dren to warmth and safety at Nyack
Lodge.
By 2:45 p.m. 125 persons had been
evacuated, including five litter cases
described as "not in dangerous con
dition." The first 27 off the train by
12:30 p.m. were described as being
in a "weak condition."
Southern Pacific Railroad officials
set 12 midnight as the tentative de
parture time for the relief train
standing by to take the passengers
to the Bay Area. The train was ex
pected to arrive at Oakland some
time after 6 a.m. Thursday.
The evacuation proceeded slowly
because the "snow cats" carrying
passengers from the train to the
highway do not hold many persons.
A landing field was being stamped
into the snow in Donner Pass so
a helicopter could remove any sick
passengers in need of hospital
treatment.
The helicopter already had drop
ped (500 pounds of medicine and
lowered a doctor in a sling.
The stranded passengers and
crewmen had huddled in coats and
blankets aboard the half - buried
train since two snowslides halted it
at noon Sunday high in the moun
tains about 60 air miles northeast
of Sacramento.
The evacuation began shortly af
ter California State Highway crews,
wosking behind a churning plow,
cleared the five - mile stretch of
highway between here and the
train.
Some passengers walked from the
train to automobiles, but many
women and children were carried
from the train by snowcat.
In the meantime, both cast- and
west-bound transcontinental trains
have been rerouted over Union Pa
cific and Santa Fe Railroad tracks
from Ogden, Utah, west. At Ogden
west - bound trains switch to UP
trackage through Salt Lake City to
Barstow, Calif. From Barstow the
SP trains travel on Santa Fe tracks
to Mojave where they are trans
ferred back to SP lines through the
San Joaquin Valley to Bakersfield
and Oakland.
