SEATTLE â€” Two Coast Guard
cutters and a B-17 carried on an al
most hopeless search for the 46
crewmen of the freighter Pennsyl
vania which was abanboned in the
stormy North Pacific a week ago
today. The Coast-Guard said there
was only a "slim" chance any of
the freighter's crewmen would be
found alive.
Further "extensive" air search
was ordered terminated after the
crew of a PBM Mariner sighted an
overturned lifeboat yesterday about
125 miles southeast of where the
7,800-ton freighter is believed to
have gone down.
