# Worst Storm Of Century
## 
### 
California began digging out
Wednesday from the worst
storm in a half-century that
choked the mountains with
snow and in the southern half
of the state brought floods which
took two lives, washed out
homes and snarled railroad uni
highway transportation.
Heaviest rainfall was reported at
Santa Barbara where more than
five inches of precipitation forced
lowlantf residents to evacuate then
homes and torrents rushing off
through normally dry riverbeds
washed out bridges and made roads
impassable.
In Northern California the town
of Portola was without fresh food
after heavy snow blocked roads
into the area. Mayor (ieorge Sax
ton asked the Governor to declare
a state cf emergency. After re
ceiving the request. Gov. Earl
Warren ordered California Air
National Guard planes to fly sup
plies and critically needed inedi
eine to the town.
In addition to Portola, other
Northern California communities
Isolated by the heavy snow and be
ginning to dig themselves out were
Susanville, Chester, Tahoe City,
Truckee, Alturas, and Westwood.
It was estimated that it would be
five days before U.S. Highway 40 j;,
open across Donner Summit to Ne
vada, although the Southern Pa
cific said it hoped to get railroa !
traffic moving across the summit
within two days.
Although airlines resumed fly
ing into Reno, highways to the
Nc ada city still weir blocked b.y
r« ( »w to th** north, south, and west.
Virginia City, Nev., was lestored
to contact with the outside world
when highway crews cut through
15-foot drifts to open a single
lane to asito traffic.
The south side of Lake Tahoe and
Meek's Bay, on the side, were
being reached only by boat, aero: .
the famed resort lake. Compton
ville and Yuba City also were vir
tually isolated and were reportc i
running low on fuel and food.
The snow also isolated Ov/ctv,
Valley in Southern California and
all communications with the town .
of Bishop and Independence were
cut off by fallen telephone and tel
egraph lines. Gov. Warren asked
the State Highway Patrol to at
tempt, to set up communications
with the blizzard-swept valley from
which much of the Los Angeles
water and electricity comes.
Rain continued to Ml most
Wednesday throughout Southern
California hut the precipitation
was a drizzle instead of the new
cloudburst rain of the previous
24 hours which dumped nearly
four inches in the los Angeles
area.
Coastal trains ran as much as
eight to 12 hours behind schedule.
The crack Southern Pacific passen
ger train, the Lark, which make ; i
high-speed run nightly between Lo:;
Angeles and San Francisco, wa;
about 12 hours behind schedule as
it twice was re-routed and finally
crept north through California's
Central Valley over Santi. Ft
tracks. The Daylight, another fa t.
