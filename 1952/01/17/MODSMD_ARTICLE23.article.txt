# That Thing Called Shrinkage
## 
### 
Seventeen vacancies now exist in women's
living groups, including several Row Houses,
Union Units and Union Residence. But these
vacancies cannot be filled until the next draw
ing period, at the end of this guarter.
This situation might seem very unpleasant,
especially for those students who tried to get
into one of these residences in the last or pre
vious drawings.
But these vacancies cannot be filled this
guarter bpcause cf several regulations drawn
up by Hdusing Committee to insure each stu
dent h fair and indiscriminate system of draw
ing residences.
Uffiese regulations, particulaily one called
had been fully understood,
ther&would probably be seventeen happier
girl&ioday and a less crowded Lagunita.
Th«r present regulations of Housing Com
mitted which were drawn up by and approved
by students, are as follows:
1. general drawing for residences is held
at thefend cf each guarter, usually on Thurs
day. JjJXhe following day a student may with-
number.
3SL"
2. w ThW day alter assignments to living
groups have been posted, a student who
hastfbbeen assigned to one of her first three
choices and who has remained in the drawing
mas sign up for shrinkage at the Housing
Off[ce.
3.'When a vacancy occurs, students on
shrinkage will be placed according to their
class and number in the drawing. When there
are rjo names on shrinkage for the available
vacancies, as is the present case, no students
will moved into the openings.
4c:Shrinkage only lasts until the second
we&k-in the guarter, ending on the same day
as the deadline lor changes in study cards.
SfSonsors, contrary to a common notion, can.
go on shrinkage. But unlike other students,
they, draw before the general drawing. This
provision was put in to give sponsors an ad
vantage, but as evidenced in the last drawing
this .System can work to their disadvantage.
Since many vacancies occur after the general
dravving, it lias been suggested that sponsors
dra\y after rather than before this general draw
ing for residences.

On the subject of sponsor drawing or any
other tegulation Housing Committee is open
for suggestions. Since man/ of these hous
ing policies have been enacted within the
past two yeais, they may be relatively new
to the majority oi the student body, and un
fortunately unfamiliar.
Housing Committee, a standing committee
of AWS, is designed to carry oat the interests
ol the students. Working with chairman Betty
Plaxton are representatives of each campus
Jiving unit—Lagunita, Ventura, the How, liran
ner. Roble, and Union.
Better communications between the Com
mittee and students as a whole plus more di
rect publicity and information on housing reg
ulations would correct an otherwise success
ful system. Perhaps the present case of seven
teen vacancies will encourage a better under
standing of Housing Committee's policies come

thf next drawing.—S.G,
Seventeen vacancies now exist in women's
living groups, including several Row Houses,
Union Units and Union Residence. But these
vacancies cannot be filled until the next draw
ing period, at the end of this guarter.
This situation might seem very unpleasant,
especially for those students who tried to get
into one of these residences in the last or pre
vious drawings.
But these vacancies cannot be filled this
guarter bpcause cf several regulations drawn
up by Hdusing Committee to insure each stu
dent h fair and indiscriminate system of draw
ing residences.
Uffiese regulations, particulaily one called
had been fully understood,
ther&would probably be seventeen happier
girl&ioday and a less crowded Lagunita.
Th«r present regulations of Housing Com
mitted which were drawn up by and approved
by students, are as follows:
1. general drawing for residences is held
at thefend cf each guarter, usually on Thurs
day. JjJXhe following day a student may with-
number.
3SL"
2. w ThW day alter assignments to living
groups have been posted, a student who
hastfbbeen assigned to one of her first three
choices and who has remained in the drawing
mas sign up for shrinkage at the Housing
Off[ce.
3.'When a vacancy occurs, students on
shrinkage will be placed according to their
class and number in the drawing. When there
are rjo names on shrinkage for the available
vacancies, as is the present case, no students
will moved into the openings.
4c:Shrinkage only lasts until the second
we&k-in the guarter, ending on the same day
as the deadline lor changes in study cards.
SfSonsors, contrary to a common notion, can.
go on shrinkage. But unlike other students,
they, draw before the general drawing. This
provision was put in to give sponsors an ad
vantage, but as evidenced in the last drawing
this .System can work to their disadvantage.
Since many vacancies occur after the general
dravving, it lias been suggested that sponsors
dra\y after rather than before this general draw
ing for residences.

On the subject of sponsor drawing or any
other tegulation Housing Committee is open
for suggestions. Since man/ of these hous
ing policies have been enacted within the
past two yeais, they may be relatively new
to the majority oi the student body, and un
fortunately unfamiliar.
Housing Committee, a standing committee
of AWS, is designed to carry oat the interests
ol the students. Working with chairman Betty
Plaxton are representatives of each campus
Jiving unit—Lagunita, Ventura, the How, liran
ner. Roble, and Union.
Better communications between the Com
mittee and students as a whole plus more di
rect publicity and information on housing reg
ulations would correct an otherwise success
ful system. Perhaps the present case of seven
teen vacancies will encourage a better under
standing of Housing Committee's policies come
thf next drawing.—S.G,
