# Young Republicans
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees will consider at their
meeting today a recommendation by Excom
that the Stanford Young Republicans be char
tered under the ASSU. A favorable vote from
the Board may result in a slight chink in Stan
ford's iron curtain against politics.
The constitution which Excom approved
stated that the purpose of the Young Repub
licans club would be to "acguaint Stanford stu
dents with the American political scene as par
ticularly reflected by the Republican party,
and shall be educational in nature." This
doesn't sound dangerous, and it isn't danger
ous. The idea of political awareness among
students through limited partisan activity on
campus is a sound thesis in a country which
accepts the party system.
We hope the Board approves. Stanford has
little excuse for ducking behind an iron curtain
on this issue. If the present flat ban on all cam
pus political activity is modified, some sort of
intelligent and educational political action here
rould take place. Why shy away from politics
at school when politics in a partisan sense is
the accepted vjj.y of life in America?
