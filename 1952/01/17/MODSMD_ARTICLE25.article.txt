### PETE GROTHE 
IT ISN'T LOGICAL
A course is being taught in the I.SJU brain factory
v/hicji I believe is not logical.
And the name of this course is "logic."
Th)s course is given by the Philosophy Department..
Admittedly, I am a layman in regard to philosophy
courSes, but I am of the conviction that it is highly
logical for students not to take "logic." 1 say this after
having read some of the tests that the gentlemen who
teach "logic" distribute at regularly-spaced intervals
to the students.

Tliose taking the test are sup
posed to piove the premises by
sentential calculus or techniques
of qualification. Or so it says on *
the test. Question one says, "If
Al took the house he was able to
pay for it. If he liked the house
and tvas able to pay for it, then he
misrepresented the facts to Bob.
Therefore, if Al took the house and
did ndt represent the facts to Bob,
then, he did not like the house."

Now, I am of the school of thought that education
should be practical, that more stress shnuld be placcd
on courses that better help us get along with our fel
low-man. And what with persons shooting at other
persons in Korea, presidential candidates throwing
thch* hats in the ring, and countries monkeying with
atomic bombs, I care little whether Al took the house
or not. My only guess is that Bob is getting a raw
deal.'

The next question says simply enough, "If it is
raining the road is wet. Jf the sun is shining, the road
is dusty. If it is freezing, the road is icy. Either it is
raining or the sun is shining or it is freezing. If the
road is wet, then the road is not dusty and the road is
not icy. Ii the road is icy, then the road is not wet
and the road is not dusty, il the road is dusty, then the
road is not wet and the road is not icy. Therefore, if
the road is wet il is raining, arid if the road is icy it is
freezing, and ii the road is dusty the sun is shining."
No wonder Bob is getting a raw deal. What with
if.v roads and freezing 1 temperatures with dust to
hoot, how is Boh ever supposed to get lo Al's house.
That is if Al ever took I!«*.• house which hinged on
his misrepresenting the facts to Bob, 01 something
like that. I hope this all sounds logical to you.
Let's go to the third question: "A gets the job as
paiking attendant il lie diives a red car. H gets the
job it he diives a maroon car. C gets it if lip drives a
yellow one. A is more likely to get the job as paik
ing attendant if C diives a white car and B is less
likely to do the samp if the other two drive opposite
color cars. Therefore, B gets the job."
My only guess is that B will he mighty sorry to
gel the job, especially since movie producers are
loving around (-Hiking lots these days taking pot
shots at their wives' agents. 'I here are safer places to
he at llotn parking lots.

IT ISN'T LOGICAL
A course is being taught in the I.SJU brain factory
v/hicji I believe is not logical.
And the name of this course is "logic."
Th)s course is given by the Philosophy Department..
Admittedly, I am a layman in regard to philosophy
courSes, but I am of the conviction that it is highly
logical for students not to take "logic." 1 say this after
having read some of the tests that the gentlemen who
teach "logic" distribute at regularly-spaced intervals
to the students.

Tliose taking the test are sup
posed to piove the premises by
sentential calculus or techniques
of qualification. Or so it says on *
the test. Question one says, "If
Al took the house he was able to
pay for it. If he liked the house
and tvas able to pay for it, then he
misrepresented the facts to Bob.
Therefore, if Al took the house and
did ndt represent the facts to Bob,
then, he did not like the house."

Now, I am of the school of thought that education
should be practical, that more stress shnuld be placcd
on courses that better help us get along with our fel
low-man. And what with persons shooting at other
persons in Korea, presidential candidates throwing
thch* hats in the ring, and countries monkeying with
atomic bombs, I care little whether Al took the house
or not. My only guess is that Bob is getting a raw
deal.'

The next question says simply enough, "If it is
raining the road is wet. Jf the sun is shining, the road
is dusty. If it is freezing, the road is icy. Either it is
raining or the sun is shining or it is freezing. If the
road is wet, then the road is not dusty and the road is
not icy. Ii the road is icy, then the road is not wet
and the road is not dusty, il the road is dusty, then the
road is not wet and the road is not icy. Therefore, if
the road is wet il is raining, arid if the road is icy it is
freezing, and ii the road is dusty the sun is shining."
No wonder Bob is getting a raw deal. What with
if.v roads and freezing 1 temperatures with dust to
hoot, how is Boh ever supposed to get lo Al's house.
That is if Al ever took I!«*.• house which hinged on
his misrepresenting the facts to Bob, 01 something
like that. I hope this all sounds logical to you.
Let's go to the third question: "A gets the job as
paiking attendant il lie diives a red car. H gets the
job it he diives a maroon car. C gets it if lip drives a
yellow one. A is more likely to get the job as paik
ing attendant if C diives a white car and B is less
likely to do the samp if the other two drive opposite
color cars. Therefore, B gets the job."
