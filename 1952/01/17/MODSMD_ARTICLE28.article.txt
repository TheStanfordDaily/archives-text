# Off Campus Women Adopt Social Rules
## 
### MARY MASSEY 
Off campus women are now under the same social regulations i
demerit system that the rest of Stanford women are. Tlie off
campus women voted last October to come under the system,
and the change went into effect this quarter.
Eligible women are now held accountable for any violations ;

they incur while guests in a campus
residence. Before the change the
hostess living in the residence re
ceived her off-campus guest's viola
tions. To come under this new sys
tem, off - campus women must be
eligible for campus residence—sin
gle undergraduates under 215 years.
Like the women on campus, olT
campus women also have the bo
nus privilege now —15 minutes
per quarter which can lie used for
emergency late returns. Similarly
otf-campus freshmen may receive
four demerits before possible so
cial probation and live demerits
before possible suspension.
This year off-campus women who
are not freshmen will be considered
us transfer students regarding the
number of demerits that may be
accumulated before possible social
probation or suspension. If an off
campus woman has lived on campus
at one time, her former record will
be resumed.
'1 be hostess in the residence is
still responsible for registering all
guests with the director and for
making meal arrangements. One
new technical violation was added

to the off-campus women: at the
bottom of each sign-out slip it is
necessary to write "off campus
guest of Mary l!>rown (hostess)."
In voting in the new system the
off-campus women wanted to as
sume their own responsibility as
Stanford women by being account -
able for the violations they incur as
guests. They also felt that they
would be better prepared for cam
pus residence living.
Since a knowledge of the demerit
system is essential to the new plan,
Women's Council is sending a copy
of both the Social Regulations Book
and a bulletin explaining the change
to all off-campus women.
Women's Council members are
Helen Austin, chairman; Betty Lou
Edson, Alice Gait, Donnie Stewart,
Joanne Hixon, and Jan Hicks.
