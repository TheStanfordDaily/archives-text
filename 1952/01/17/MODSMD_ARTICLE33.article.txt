### "DIGGER" ODELL 
Those of you who have been trying to follow the recent developments
of the NCAA meetings in Cincinnati and the proposals put forth by the 11-
man National Council on Education Committee, the college presidents, may
have been confused by all the recommendations and counter-recommen
dations.

We were!
To clear up the situation and to
see what the effect will be on Stan
ford, we dropped in on A 1 Masters,
Stanford Athletic Director, yesterday.
Al, who arrived back on the Farm
yesterday from Cincinnati in the wee
hours of the morning was being re
routed and delayed for 24 hours. His
cheerful manners belied the exhaust
ing journey and meetings of the
NCAA of which he is a member.
According to Masters, the mum
ble-jumble which appeared in the
papers just about covered the
mumble-jumble of the meetings,
but he did clear up the stand which
Stanford took at the meetings.
Concerning the football de
emphasizing squabble, Al pointed out
that the recommendations made
merely brought most of the other
conferences up to the par of the PCC.
For example, one of the new bylaws
which states that every athlete must
maintain the academic standards of
the school in which he is enrolled and
must maintain an advancement to
ward a degree, is almost identical
v/ith one of the PCC by-laws.

In other words, 1 lie changes that wore made with the purposes in mind
toward de-emphasizing football had little effect on the Pacific Coast Con
ference.
In passing the new rilling that all scholarship programs should he
brought within the college or university financial setup itself, the NCAA
actually raised the standards of its members to those which Stanford has
maintained for many years.
Stanford's Buck-of-The-Month Club, now the Buck Club, is an ex
cellent example of what the NCAA would like to see. Unfortunately, there
are many schools throughout the country, some in the PCC, whose alumni
groups maintain, with the knowledge and consent of the schools, what are
known as "slush funds." These "slush funds" are accumulated by alumni
outside the university and athletes are supported directly from this fund.
This is what the new ruling struck out at.
Stanford, however, fared less well when it came to rule changes in the
game of football itself. At the Convention Masters voted for the elimination
of both spring practice and the free substitution rule. You know, of course,
that the proposal to drop the free substitution rule was defeated, while a
compromise on spring practice was effected cutting the number of days of
the organized spring session to 20 sessions within 30 calendar days.
Al, though, was very pleased to see the old clipping rule brought back
(clipping is now defined as hitting anywhere in the back instead of just
below the waist) and stricter interpretations placed on other violations.
We wore interested in the effect of the NCE Presidents' Committee on
the NCAA and tossed the question directly at Al, who replied that there
was actually no battle of the committees, but that it must be remembered
that although the NCAA may make recommendations, it is tip to the schools
themselves, and the presidents in particular, to put the recommendations
into effect.
Masters stated that he believes that the NCAA is on the way out and he
was not unhappy about it. Said Al, "There's too much politics in the NCAA.
Those not in favor of a program spend their time countering to keep it from
being discussed and very little can be done."
Al is in favor of a retrenchment program and says that he has talked
to Dr. Sterling on the matter and found him in agreement. According to
Masters, the NCAA should be dropped and then the presidents, athletic
directors, and coaches of the PCC schools should get together and reach
agreement on specific points. That way the coaches can be told, "You can
do this and you can't do that," in specific terms, instead of the vague treat
ment that's being given them now.
It has been our belief for some time that the NCAA is getting too poli
tical and unwieldy a group to properly control amateur athletics. If a
retrenchment program such as Masters has presented can be effected,
we're in favor of it.
