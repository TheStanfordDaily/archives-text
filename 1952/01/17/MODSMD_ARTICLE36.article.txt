# MILLINTON
## Boxer Quits Indian Squad 
### 
Stanford's varsity boxers, already
short a heavyweight for tonight's
battle with the ringmen of Califor
nia, were dealt a further blow yes
terday when Bill Millington, Stan
ford's only entrant at 156 pounds,
was forced to drop the sport due to
sickness in his family.
A transfer from Long Beach JC
who won the 15G-1 b. crown in last
quarter's mural tournament, Mil
lington was scheduled to battle Cal's
Art Hillman tonight. As matters
now stand, the Cards will have to
forfeit that one as well as the
heavyweight division.
Although Coach Ray Lunny is
pessimistic concerning the possibili
ties of uncovering a 158-lb. entry
for Stanford's later matches, the
dapper mentor was cheered earlier
this week by the news that heavy
weight Herb Cohen, a finalist in the
mural tourney, will be available for
varsity duty in later matches. Co
hen will probably see his first action
when Stanford hosts Cal Poly on
Feb. 7.
MHlington's retirement leaves a
total of seven bouts on tonight's
card, which gets under way at 8 at
the Berkeley Men's Gymnasium.
The Bears claim the edge in expe
rience, boasting four lettermen from
last year, while Stanford's Bob Bal
docchi at 165 lbs. and 139-pounder
Bob White are Lunny's only veter
ans.
Both Baldocchi and White trade
blows with experienced Cal hands
in what should be the highlights of
the card. Baldocchi fights Jim Mc-
Cann, with White meeting Myron
Hansen.
In other bouts, Romeo Formen
tini (S) and Ed Sato will have at it
in the 125-lb. curtain raiser; Bob
Chalmers (S) meets Ken Hansen at
132 lbs.; Ed Scarboro (S) duels Jay
Slaybaugh in the 147-lb. class; Tony
Wynn (S) battles Fred Shieman in
the second 165-lb. melee; and Bill
McMahon (S) closes the evening
with a light-heavy tussle against
Bear Dan Clawson.
