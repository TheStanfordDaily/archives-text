# Position of Indian Sports Publicist Keeps Don Liebendorfer Busy
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Centering one end of the BAC Building is the well-lighted office
of the man largely responsible for the widespread name and fame
of Stanford sports â€”Don Liebendorfer, Director of Athletic News
Information.
In this day when newspapermen are becoming ever more de-

pendent upon school news services-*
to keep them filled in on college
j sports news, Liebendorfer occupies
'< a key spot in the Farm's athletic ad
ministration.
Duties IMany and Varied
It is his job, first of all, to handle
the publicity and public relations
for Stanford teams in all sports.
This duty burdens him the heaviest
during football season when he
travels a week ahead of the team to
the localities where it plays away to
"beat the drum" for the game.
He furnishes background infor
mation and daily releases to all the
newspapers in the area, appears on
radio and TV shows (he set some
sort of a personal record during the
past season by appearing on no less
than seven TV programs in the
week he was in Detroit before the
Stanford-Michigan game), speaks at
luncheons and other gatherings, and
even is called upon to furnish alums
with the latest news about the
Farm.
For all other sports, Liebendorfer
furnishes weekly press releases and
photographic material for use by
the newspapers.
Secondly, he is responsible for
press accommodations at all Stan
ford athletic contests. This again
is a particularly heavy duty during
football season, and to a lesser ex
tent at basketball time.
Newspapermen, photographers,
TV and newsreel cameramen, and
radio announcers all must be ac
commodated in Stanford's inade
quate press-box facilities.
This furnishes Don with a some
what paradoxical role. While he is
supposed to be spreading friendship
and good will for the Farm, he is
forced to say a polite but firm "no"
to many fine newsmen who simply
will not fit in.

Liebendorfer also is the man be
hind the programs for all Card con
tests. He arranges for the whole
show in this sector: information, ad
vertising contracts, makeup, print
ing, and distribution.
Then there are the innumerable
requests for the various Stanford
coaches to act as speakers that must
be handled. Almost every sort of
service club, alumni organization,
and many schools desire a coach to
speak at some function or another.
Sometimes Don is up against it to
fulfill the requirements of these in
vitations. For instance, in the days
of the Schwartz regime there was
one club in a city in the lower San
Joaquin Valley that just could not
understand why Marchie could not
speak at an early fall luncheon they
were holding.
What they could not get through
their noggins, however, was that the
day of the luncheon was the clay of
Stanford's opening ballgame of that
year, and a chap just cannot lie in
two places at once.
Finally, if you don't think Lie
bendorfer is already loaded with
things to attend to, he also handles
the film exchanges for the movies
of Stanford games, is in charge of
the public announcement system at
all contests, and picks up the loose
ends for Director of Athletics Al
Masters while holding the title of
the latter's administrative assistant.
Highly Praised
Just how well Don (who is his
own one-man staff, the only one to
his knowledge at a major school on
the Pacific Coast) accomplishes his
many duties is probably very well
reflected in the comments of more
than one San Francirco sports col
umnist who thought that the 1952

Rose Bowl game was the best han
dled, from a press standpoint, of any
he had ever attended.
The likable Information Director
worked into his job as a student
back in 1924, when the University
began to see the growing need for
a man to furnish athletic news.
While editor of The Daily, he took
the job on a part-time basis, but as
the scope of the undertaking be
came apparent, he soon became the I
first full-time Director of Athletic
Information for any college in the
United States.
Served in Navy
He has held the position ever
since with the exception of 45 j
months from March 1942 to Novem- '
ber 1945 when he served as an offi- j
cer in the U.S. Naval Reserve on |
active duty.
Through the years, he has seen
the job grow and develop to its
present stature. At first there were
no statistics officially kept, but as
the college news services began to
develop, so did the maintenance of
these figures, so popular with fol
lowers of sports.
When the PA system was in
stalled in Stanford Stadium in 1927
(the first in any major stadium on
the coast) Don got the task, more
or less by accident, of announcer.
While Al Masters was puzzling
over the various candidates for the
job, Liebendorfer, never having
had any speaking experience, sort
of jokingly asked, "Why don't I do
it?" "No, you'd be too prejudiced,"
came back the reply.
But as the day of the first football
game of 1927 approached and no
man had been hired, Masters asked
Don if he would not announce it
on a temporary basis. He did. and
performed the job so competently
that he announced all the football
games up until the middle of 1949,
when the rest of his tasks became
too many for him to continue.
However, he still calls all the con
tests on the Farm other than foot
ball. and he is in charge of the foot
ball announcer.

He also probably has a silent wish
that the budget situation would al
low him an assistant or two so that
he could do an even more out
standing job of dispensing Stanford
sport news and information.
