TAKE ME OUT TO THE GULL PARK—With the San Francisco Bay Area wringing wet following
a four-day downpour, only these seagulls found this submerged Tiburon, Calif., baseball field
suitable for use. The storm forced 2,500 persons from their homes and caused $300,000 damage
in San Francisco. —ACME Telephoto
