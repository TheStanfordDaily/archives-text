# Student Describes Dutch 'Hell Week'; 'Greens' Wear Hats to Hide Baldness

(Editor's note: Dick Schwarz, a
Dutch citizen now studying at
Stanford, has heen in this coun
try for a little more than one
year. Below he gives his impres
sions of "Hell Week" in the Neth
erlands. Schwarz is head photog
rapher for The Daily.)

"Hell Week" at Stanford is
usually thought of as a tough pe
riod for all the pledged fresh
men. It Is interesting to take a
look at the same period in the
Netherlands.
In Holland the system of frater
nities, rushing, pledging, and ini
tiation is completely different.
Fraternities as we know them
here do not exist in Holland. The
students at Amsterdam University,
for example, may join the Associa
tion of Students, which can be com
pared with the ASSU here. If the
freshmen decide to join the asso
ciation, they have to go through an
initiation period resembling Hell
Week here, lasting 19 days.
Your hair is shaven off, so that
everybody in the country can rec
ognize. you as a "Green." All
kinds of hats and weird head gear
are used by the Greens to hide
their naked heads.
From 10 in the morning until 4
at night the Green must, whenever
a sophomore talks to him, crawl on
his knees. He must also obey every
order. Even if the order is absurd,
the Green must obey unless he can
reason his way out. This sharpens
rearoning.
Often the Greens have to fight
themselves out of the initiation
building because the sophs try to
keep the huge doors closed. Many
a leg has been broken in the past
100 years; so today the fighting is a
little less rugged.
Last year the sophomores had a
new gag. All the Greens were
stripped to the waist and painted as
lions. They assembled in the hall
of the building, the lights were
turned off, and the sophomores stood
on the stairway, throwing burning
torches into the "arena"; they were
playing "Daniel in the Lions' Den"!
If you survive the ordeal of ini
tiation, rushing starts. Although
fraternities do not exist, there
arc around 15 discussion groups
in each university; and each year
they select new members. This
type of rushing is called "flirting."
The discussion groups have their
own names and purposes and meet
veryo ften. They have their own
parties, and the alumni of each
group meet almost every year after
they have graduated.

The night before initiation into
the Association is the mott tumul
tuous orgy you can imagine. It is
called "bar-fun," appropriately, be
cause each Green receives a bottle
of gin from his "father." These fa
thers are the sophomores, who have
each picked a "son" among the
Greens. Each father, in his turn,
got a father the previous year and
so cach Green has a complete fam
ily. ,
It is a traditional "must" that he
drink with all members of his fam
ily, which invariably results in
drunkenness for the whole group.
Then everybody goes to see a show
put on by the Greens wherein they
ridicule their initiators, who shout
back injults during the perform
ance.
In Delft, another university
city, initiation is climaxed by a
huge battle the next day between
tl'e Greens of Delft and those of
The Hague. This takes place in
front of The Hague's initiation
building, which *the Greens try
to defend with firehoses and tear
gas. Police are all around the
place, and nobody else can enter
the battle jj^a.

When all those activities are over
in October, studying begins; and the
Green is finally accepted as a
freshman.
Just as at Stanford, the Council
of Inter-University Associations de
cided last year to restrict all ini
tiation to the Association buildint*
and the private rooms of the sopho
mores.
Most educators agree that the pe
riod of initiation is very helpful in
making a man out of each fresh
man, to teach him humbleness and
independence, in short to build his
character.
Usually the had part of initia
tion is soon forgotten, and l»y Hie
time the hairs have grown to their
normal length on the heads of the
freshmen they only remember the
fun they've had.
And it is a good thing Tor them
to know that they can revenge
themselves on the innocent Greens
who will enter the University the
next year.
