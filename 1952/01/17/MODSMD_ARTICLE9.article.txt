# TRUMAN'S BUDGET
## Large Tax Jump Asked 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1G (UP)
President Truman asked a
generally hostile Congress to
day for more than $5 billion in
new taxes, tighter price controls
and stronger curbs on install
ment buying as part of an anti-
Communist program ol "tragic
necessity."
Most members of Congress promptly
retorted that his proposals will have
tough sledding at best. Several key
Democratic fiscal leaders said flatly
that taxes will not be raised, although
some "loopholes" in the present law
might be plugged.
One high Democratic chieftain,
who refused use of his name,
thought Congress in its present
mood might cut taxes if it actually
considers a new law this election
year. Many lawmakers called in
stead for sharp reductions in fed
eral spending.
In his annual economic message,
Mr. Truman abandoned all hope of
putting the defense program on a
pay-as-we-go basis even if his tax
request should be granted. He also
said federal spending will hit 85 to
00 billion dollars in fiscal 1953, com
pared with $71 billion this year.
The President estimated that the
federal deficit will reach $8 billion by
June 30 — end of the present fiscal
year—and climb to $lti billion by
June 30, 1953, "unless further vigor
ous action to raise taxes is taken very
soon."
Warning that the next two years
will he "hard" ones, lie said Ameri
cans will have to give up some of
their "enjoyments." He predicted
cutbacks in home building, produc
tion of TV sets and household items
and said fewer than 4,000,000 new
autos will be built this year, cum
arcd with 5,300,000 in 1951. lie saw
no decrease in supplies of food and
clothing.
Anticipating the congressional de
mands for reduced government
spending, Mr. Truman called for
"constant weeding out of waste" but
warned that it would be "disastrous
to reduce the defense strain by tor
pedoing the defense program." He
said funds for "essential needs"
should be obtained through taxation
"insofar as possible."
He did not give details of his tax
plans hut said additional revenue
could be raised by closing loopholes
in the law, taking away ccrtain con
cessions granted some groups and
by some tax increases.
The tax proposals were part of a
12 - point legislative program which
also called for the stiffcr price and
credit controls Mr. Truman failed to
get last year, more foreign aid, im
proved social security and unem
ployment benefits, continued rent
controls, better farm price supports
and revision of the Taft-Hartley la
bor law.
Republicans almost to a man turned
their backs on the President's recom
mendations, mindful that the senate
GOP policy committee had voted
unanimously against a tax hike this
year.
Even some of Mr. Truman's most
powerful congressional leaders were
against him. They included chair
man Robert L. Doughton, (D-N.C.) of
the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee; chairman Walter
F. George (D-Ga.) of the Senate Fi
nance Committee, and chairman Tom
Connally (D-Tex.) of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee.
