## Churchill OK's Atomic Lead 
### 
WAIIIINGTON, Jhii 17 (UP)-
Prime Minister Winston Churchill
appealed today for "not gold but
.steel" to strengthen Britain and
urged the United States to main
tain its atomic lead over Russia as
the "supreme deterrent" against
World War 111.
Addressing an appreciative joint
session of Congress, the 77-year-old
British Conservative leader said the
West faces the threat of a new ag
gressor "as dangerous and as hate
ful" as Hitler.
But he said American rearma
ment, aided by British and Euro
pean defense buildups, "has already
altered the balance of the world"
an 1 may yet avert World War 111
or the "horror of defeat and subju
gation" if it comes.
But there was quick dissent when
the Conservative leader said it
would "enormously aid" Britain if
"even token forces" of the other
powers in the Middle East Com
mand— the United States, France,
and Turkey — were sent to the
troubled Suez.
