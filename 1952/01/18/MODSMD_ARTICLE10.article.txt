# New Farm Language Requirement Fixed
## 
### GORDON McKIBBEN Editor of The Daily 
The much discussed lower division language requirement will
soon have a new look. Effective summer quarter, the lower division
requirement for Germanic, Romanic and Classical languages will
be reduced from 21 units to 13. The languages v/ill be taught in
three-unit courses over a six quarter span.
Professor Freidrich Strothmann, executive head of the depart-

ment of Romanic and Germanic lan
guages, announced the new policy
last night.
The plan has been approved by the
Lower Division Committee and needs
only official sanction from the Aca
demic Council.
Dr. Strothmann said the new
system had been under considera
tion for over a year. He said one
of the main advantages would he
that freshmen will not have to lake
such a heavy load during their first
quarters here.
Under the present system, lower
division students who have had no
language in high school must take
three five-unit courses stressing
grammar and conversation, plus two
three-unit reading courses.
Dr. Strothmann explained that
under the new plan less time will
be required during the first three
quarters (nine units) because con
versation will not be emphasized.
He added that valuable literature
will be the subject matter for the
last nine units.
The objective of the requirement,
he said, was to enable students to
undertake intelligent reading in the
language upon completion of the
sixth quarter.
Entering lower division students
who have had some language in
high school will be given place
ment tests to determine where they
should start. Dr. Strothmann said
the placement tests would be ac
curately constructed and patterned
after the type of exam now given
for Germanic languages.
Students who are now taking lower
division language courses will con
tinue under the present system of
three five-unit and two three-unit
courses until they finish the require
ment. The new.system will start
summer quarter.
The language requirement has
been a topic of campus discussion
for the past few months after a
scries of Daily Bull Sessions by
Dick McLean in which he criticized
the present system and asked for
constructive changes. The Student-
Faculty Education Committee has
been in contact with fhe problem
of late.
The Lower Division Committee has
had the entire lower division pro
gram under observation for about
three years. The language require
ment is just one of several problems
studied by this committee.
