# DEFENSE PLAN
## UMT Begins If Congress OK's Plan 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP)
— Defense officials said today
thai — Congress willing — the
armed services will start univer
sal military training this fall v/ilh
60,000 volunteer 18-year-olds
who would be put on active duty
after six-months training.
They said they would start by tak
ing 5,000 volunteers a month for the
first year and then put the program
on a compulsory basis until some
800,000 men a year are being in
ducted for six months training. After
their training the "UMTEES" would
be placed in the reserves for 7'/j
years.
But Lovett said the first 00,000
trainees would be called for 18
months active service as soon as they
finished their training. They first
would be placed in the reserves only
as a matter of form.
The defense secretary offered two
proposals which are ccrtain to be
opposed by the House Committee.
In fact, his entire plan is similar
to one advanced by committee
chairman Carl Vinson (D-Ga.) and
rejected informally by other mem
bers.
Lovett suggested thai. Congress
keep the draft law on the books "two
or three years" after UMT is started.
Committee members have proposed
a ban on further drafting for im
mediate active service after the first
12 months of UMT.
The committee also has indicated
it will oppose calling trainees to
activc duty immediately after six
mouths training. They want to put
all trainees in the reserves and
keep a tight rein on the Presi
dent's power to call them to active
service.
Under the Defense Department's
plan, the 60,000 volunteer trainees
would agree in advance to 18 months
active duty after finishing their
training. They also would be paid
$75 a month during training—the
same as recruits in active service—
instead of the $"0 proposed for
"UMTEES" once the program is in
full swing.
The first year's "volunteers" would
come from 18-year-old youths who
knew they faced induction calls un
der the draft law.

Committee members have proposed
a ban on further drafting for im
mediate active service after the first
12 months of UMT.
The committee also has indicated
it will oppose calling trainees to
activc duty immediately after six
mouths training. They want to put
all trainees in the reserves and
keep a tight rein on the Presi
dent's power to call them to active
service.
Under the Defense Department's
plan, the 60,000 volunteer trainees
would agree in advance to 18 months
active duty after finishing their
training. They also would be paid
$75 a month during training—the
same as recruits in active service—
instead of the $"0 proposed for
"UMTEES" once the program is in
full swing.
The first year's "volunteers" would
come from 18-year-old youths who
knew they faced induction calls un
der the draft law.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP)
— Defense officials said today
thai — Congress willing — the
armed services will start univer
sal military training this fall v/ilh
60,000 volunteer 18-year-olds
who would be put on active duty
after six-months training.
They said they would start by tak
ing 5,000 volunteers a month for the
first year and then put the program
on a compulsory basis until some
800,000 men a year are being in
ducted for six months training. After
their training the "UMTEES" would
be placed in the reserves for 7'/j
years.
But Lovett said the first 00,000
trainees would be called for 18
months active service as soon as they
finished their training. They first
would be placed in the reserves only
as a matter of form.
The defense secretary offered two
proposals which are ccrtain to be
opposed by the House Committee.
In fact, his entire plan is similar
to one advanced by committee
chairman Carl Vinson (D-Ga.) and
rejected informally by other mem
bers.
Lovett suggested thai. Congress
keep the draft law on the books "two
or three years" after UMT is started.
