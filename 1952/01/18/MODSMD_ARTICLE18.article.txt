# Card Cagers Go South To Battle USC Twice
## Indians Rely on Speed To Outrun Big Trojans 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford 3 cagets, M strong, planed early thi3 morning lor Los
Angeles and a two game engagement with USC'3 Trojans.
Under head coach, Bob Burnet the Indians carry with them n
conference record of two wins and two losses. The Trojan 3 aio
current tenants of the Southern Division cellar with one win and

three losses. The Cards with a sea -
son record of 12 and 3 are ranked
26th in the nation this week.
USC this year is not the SC of
the past. They still play a rough,
aggressive type of ball, but lack the
height and shooting ability of a better
than average club. Last weekend
had little trouble taking the
Trojans into camp in two game...
However Coach Burnett is not un
derestimating the ability of USC.
Earlier in the week the Card mentor
stated that his boys would have t<>
be in their best condition of the year.
So the rule of this strenuous week of
practices has been run, run, and mora
run.
USC lias TaJl Men
USC is plenty tough on the board
Bob Boyd, nicknamed the Stork,
stands 6' 6" and is one of the Coast':;
top backboard men. Boyd is also a
high scorer averaging 14.3 points per
conference game. Bob Morton is an -
other big man and a rough one. He
stands 6' 4" and weighs 215 lbs. To
gether Boyd and Morton could make
it pretty rough for Stanford on the
boards.
Ken Flower, who has been slowed,
by pneumonia, is returning to fu I
strength and could easily cause
trouble. Bruce Bennett is another
good scorer averaging better than 1 i.
points in conference play. The Tro
jan quintet is rounded out by Cap
tain Don Underwood.
Stanford will open with the same
five men who have started the ma -
jority of games. Ed Tucker the lead
ing conference scorer with 69 points
in four games will open at one fot
ward together with Ron Tomsic wlv>
is also right up there in the point
column.
At center will bp old dependable,


JIM WALSH
—Ace Card guard
Captain Jim Ramstead, the boy who
has dune stellar work on the back
hoards, and is due for a busy week
end in the southland.
Ollie Suzdaleff, Card sparkplug,
and Jim Walsh, another Card high
scorer with a 14 point per game aver
age will hold down the guard spots.
Stanford (o Substitute Freely
However this week Burnett plans
to use many substitutes in an attempt
to run the Trojans into the hard
wood. This holds true especially in
tonight's lilt because Burnett does
not wish to burn out Ins opening five
Bob explains that a tired first string
v/as one of the reasons for last week's
loss to California.
The Cards will use the full court
press defense again this week as well
as the fast break. However the de
lensive error of the back men not
shifting to pick up the dribbler,
which was the Cards' downfall
aayinst the Bears, has been corrected
to the satisfaction of Burnett.
The offense has been polished and
is working with new precision. Bur
nett expects that his boys will bounce
back and do some scoring. Of course
this present aggregation is Stanford's
highest scoring team in the school's
history, boasting an average of 75.8
joints in fifteen games.
"Going Down to Win Two"
"The spirit of the team is fine,"
Burnett said, "1 am proud of the kids
and the way they have come back in
many games. It should not he for
gotten that we are a short team. This
week we are heading south to win
*v/o games."
While the Inch ans are mixing it up
down onlll UCLA, conference lend
er, will travel to Berkeley and meet
the Bears. A Bear double win which
seems unlikely, would be a blessing
lor the Cards, and a split would be
a help in Stanford's drive for the
*itle.

Stanford 3 cagets, M strong, planed early thi3 morning lor Los
Angeles and a two game engagement with USC'3 Trojans.
Under head coach, Bob Burnet the Indians carry with them n
conference record of two wins and two losses. The Trojan 3 aio
current tenants of the Southern Division cellar with one win and

three losses. The Cards with a sea -
son record of 12 and 3 are ranked
26th in the nation this week.
USC this year is not the SC of
the past. They still play a rough,
aggressive type of ball, but lack the
height and shooting ability of a better
than average club. Last weekend
had little trouble taking the
Trojans into camp in two game...
However Coach Burnett is not un
derestimating the ability of USC.
Earlier in the week the Card mentor
stated that his boys would have t<>
be in their best condition of the year.
So the rule of this strenuous week of
practices has been run, run, and mora
run.
USC lias TaJl Men
USC is plenty tough on the board
Bob Boyd, nicknamed the Stork,
stands 6' 6" and is one of the Coast':;
top backboard men. Boyd is also a
high scorer averaging 14.3 points per
conference game. Bob Morton is an -
other big man and a rough one. He
stands 6' 4" and weighs 215 lbs. To
gether Boyd and Morton could make
it pretty rough for Stanford on the
boards.
Ken Flower, who has been slowed,
by pneumonia, is returning to fu I
strength and could easily cause
trouble. Bruce Bennett is another
good scorer averaging better than 1 i.
points in conference play. The Tro
jan quintet is rounded out by Cap
tain Don Underwood.
Stanford will open with the same
five men who have started the ma -
jority of games. Ed Tucker the lead
ing conference scorer with 69 points
in four games will open at one fot
ward together with Ron Tomsic wlv>
is also right up there in the point
column.

Captain Jim Ramstead, the boy who
has dune stellar work on the back
hoards, and is due for a busy week
end in the southland.
Ollie Suzdaleff, Card sparkplug,
and Jim Walsh, another Card high
scorer with a 14 point per game aver
age will hold down the guard spots.
Stanford (o Substitute Freely
However this week Burnett plans
to use many substitutes in an attempt
to run the Trojans into the hard
wood. This holds true especially in
tonight's lilt because Burnett does
not wish to burn out Ins opening five
Bob explains that a tired first string
v/as one of the reasons for last week's
loss to California.
The Cards will use the full court
press defense again this week as well
as the fast break. However the de
lensive error of the back men not
shifting to pick up the dribbler,
which was the Cards' downfall
aayinst the Bears, has been corrected
to the satisfaction of Burnett.
The offense has been polished and
is working with new precision. Bur
nett expects that his boys will bounce
back and do some scoring. Of course
this present aggregation is Stanford's
highest scoring team in the school's
history, boasting an average of 75.8
joints in fifteen games.
"Going Down to Win Two"
"The spirit of the team is fine,"
Burnett said, "1 am proud of the kids
and the way they have come back in
many games. It should not he for
gotten that we are a short team. This
week we are heading south to win
*v/o games."
While the Inch ans are mixing it up
down onlll UCLA, conference lend
er, will travel to Berkeley and meet
the Bears. A Bear double win which
seems unlikely, would be a blessing
lor the Cards, and a split would be
a help in Stanford's drive for the

end in the southland.
Ollie Suzdaleff, Card sparkplug,

age will hold down the guard spots.
Stanford (o Substitute Freely
However this week Burnett plans
to use many substitutes in an attempt
to run the Trojans into the hard
wood. This holds true especially in
tonight's lilt because Burnett does
not wish to burn out Ins opening five
Bob explains that a tired first string
v/as one of the reasons for last week's
loss to California.
The Cards will use the full court
press defense again this week as well
as the fast break. However the de
lensive error of the back men not
shifting to pick up the dribbler,
which was the Cards' downfall
aayinst the Bears, has been corrected
to the satisfaction of Burnett.
The offense has been polished and
is working with new precision. Bur
nett expects that his boys will bounce
back and do some scoring. Of course
this present aggregation is Stanford's
highest scoring team in the school's
history, boasting an average of 75.8
joints in fifteen games.
"Going Down to Win Two"
"The spirit of the team is fine,"
Burnett said, "1 am proud of the kids
and the way they have come back in
many games. It should not he for
gotten that we are a short team. This
week we are heading south to win
*v/o games."
While the Inch ans are mixing it up
down onlll UCLA, conference lend
er, will travel to Berkeley and meet
the Bears. A Bear double win which
seems unlikely, would be a blessing
lor the Cards, and a split would be
a help in Stanford's drive for the

Stanford 3 cagets, M strong, planed early thi3 morning lor Los
Angeles and a two game engagement with USC'3 Trojans.
Under head coach, Bob Burnet the Indians carry with them n
conference record of two wins and two losses. The Trojan 3 aio
current tenants of the Southern Division cellar with one win and

three losses. The Cards with a sea -
son record of 12 and 3 are ranked
26th in the nation this week.
USC this year is not the SC of
the past. They still play a rough,
aggressive type of ball, but lack the
height and shooting ability of a better
than average club. Last weekend
had little trouble taking the
Trojans into camp in two game...
However Coach Burnett is not un
derestimating the ability of USC.
Earlier in the week the Card mentor
stated that his boys would have t<>
be in their best condition of the year.
So the rule of this strenuous week of
practices has been run, run, and mora
run.
USC lias TaJl Men
USC is plenty tough on the board
Bob Boyd, nicknamed the Stork,
stands 6' 6" and is one of the Coast':;
top backboard men. Boyd is also a
high scorer averaging 14.3 points per
conference game. Bob Morton is an -
other big man and a rough one. He
stands 6' 4" and weighs 215 lbs. To
gether Boyd and Morton could make
it pretty rough for Stanford on the
boards.
Ken Flower, who has been slowed,
by pneumonia, is returning to fu I
strength and could easily cause
trouble. Bruce Bennett is another
good scorer averaging better than 1 i.
points in conference play. The Tro
jan quintet is rounded out by Cap
tain Don Underwood.
Stanford will open with the same
five men who have started the ma -
jority of games. Ed Tucker the lead
ing conference scorer with 69 points
in four games will open at one fot
ward together with Ron Tomsic wlv>
is also right up there in the point
column.
