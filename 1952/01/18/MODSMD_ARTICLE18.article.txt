# Card Cagers Go South To Battle USC Twice
## Indians Rely on Speed To Outrun Big Trojans 
### LARRY CAHN 
Stanford 3 cagets, M strong, planed early thi3 morning lor Los
Angeles and a two game engagement with USC'3 Trojans.
Under head coach, Bob Burnet the Indians carry with them n
conference record of two wins and two losses. The Trojan 3 aio
current tenants of the Southern Division cellar with one win and

three losses. The Cards with a sea -
son record of 12 and 3 are ranked
26th in the nation this week.
USC this year is not the SC of
the past. They still play a rough,
aggressive type of ball, but lack the
height and shooting ability of a better
than average club. Last weekend
had little trouble taking the
Trojans into camp in two game...
However Coach Burnett is not un
derestimating the ability of USC.
Earlier in the week the Card mentor
stated that his boys would have t<>
be in their best condition of the year.
So the rule of this strenuous week of
practices has been run, run, and mora
run.
USC lias TaJl Men
USC is plenty tough on the board
Bob Boyd, nicknamed the Stork,
stands 6' 6" and is one of the Coast':;
top backboard men. Boyd is also a
high scorer averaging 14.3 points per
conference game. Bob Morton is an -
other big man and a rough one. He
stands 6' 4" and weighs 215 lbs. To
gether Boyd and Morton could make
it pretty rough for Stanford on the
boards.
Ken Flower, who has been slowed,
by pneumonia, is returning to fu I
strength and could easily cause
trouble. Bruce Bennett is another
good scorer averaging better than 1 i.
points in conference play. The Tro
jan quintet is rounded out by Cap
tain Don Underwood.
Stanford will open with the same
five men who have started the ma -
jority of games. Ed Tucker the lead
ing conference scorer with 69 points
in four games will open at one fot
ward together with Ron Tomsic wlv>
is also right up there in the point
column.
At center will bp old dependable,
