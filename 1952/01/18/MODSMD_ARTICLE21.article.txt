# Tension Up As Rushing End Nears
## 
### 
With the psychological warfare
called rushing entering its final
phase, fraternities will host several
hundred freshmen at beer busts,
firesides, and parties this weekend.
As of yesterday afternoon, the 24
houses reported anywhere from
four to more than 20 pledges; how
ever, the average per house was
between six and ten accepted pledge
buttons. This weekend the houses
will do their best to bolster their
lists of future brothers.
IFC President Tony Garrett said
yesterday that at the pledge card
signing next Monday night there
will be fewer pledges than in last
year's record class. Fearful of losses
at the hands of the draft last win
ter, the fraternities filled their
houses to the brim. Because of
this, there are fewer vacancies on
the Row this year.

Fraternity rushing chairmen
should leave their pledge lists at
the Daily Shack by I p.m. Mon
day fev publication in next Tues
day's rushing edition. The lists
should be left in the box provided
in the shack.

At this time, however, Garrett
explained, there are still plenty of
openings in the fraternity ranks.
The IFC head cautioned freshmen
from accepting pins from more than
one house and later deciding which
pin lo keep. He urgd that rushees
think twice and be sure of their
choicc before they finally accept a
pin.
Any freshman who has completed
one full quarter at Stanford, other
than summer quarter, is eligible for
pledging. None of the pledges are
binding, however, until the formal
card signing next Monday night at
7:30 in the Nitery.
IFC rules provide that any man
who breaks a pledge after the for
mal card signing may not pledge
another house for a period of two
full quarters of University resi
dence. If any fraternity breaks a
man's pledge, he may pledge an
other fraternity at any time.
