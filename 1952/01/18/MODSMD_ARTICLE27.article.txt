I've got something to say today,
which is probably surprising, but
I don't know quit? how to say
it . . . which probably isn't sur
prising.
All I know is that somebody's
got to let some air out of this
big balloon called rushing.
Encina's more confused than a
Chinese lire drill right now, with

Row men stalking freshmen in the halls with all the
gentleness of a Shanghai press gang.
And with all the excitement and the pressure and
the mystic aura of fraternities there's a heavy at
mosphere in the old dorm . . . enough to send a
lot of freshman hearts wondering . . .
Nobody cured about the kids whom rushing has
convinced that they're the greatest guys »n the
world and objects of much well-deserved attention.
They'll learn the why and wherefor eventually.
When it's ail over, their values will straighten cut
fast.
But there're a lot of others living in Encina whom
rushing has convinced differently, and who won't
(recover so fast. They're the kids who have to answer

the phone and open the door every five minutes to
tell the fraternity men that their roommate isn't in,
and no, sorry, he probably won't )>e back before
morning with all the rushing dates he's got.
'they're the guys to care about. They are the oner.
1 want to talk to and say, "Look, fella, wise up.
Kight now it seems like the most important thing
in Ihe world. It isn't, believe me. At Stanford
espei ially, you don't have to worry. If you really
want to b< j in a fraternity and aren't inst caught up
in the social myth ... it you want fraternity life
with all its special advantages and disadvantages
. . . then your chances are just as good as ever,
better even, when formal rushing is over, and you
become acquainted with fraternity men through
regular campus life."
Otherwise, theie aie so many men at Stanford who
have chosen a full, happy, satisfying way of life out
side of fraternities that you can't miss. There was a
time when most of the big athlete.-; and ballplayers
were all in the eating clubs, rather than on the how
Once the clubs again have their buildings, that time
may return.
The point is, guy, don't be fooled. It's a big
balloon right now and the time will come when
you'll recognize it for just that. But meanwhile,
it you let it get at your pride or your sell respect,
take it from me . . . you just aren't bright.
Someday soon, that balloon's going to burst . . .
let's drink to the day, how about it?

fast.

rushing has convinced differently, and who won't
