## 'I've Got My Fur Coat to Keep Me Warm' 
### 
To the editor:
A great many Stanford girls have short, sporty fur
coats—wasting away in the closet. Some of us would
like to wear them to class as is done in the East.
However, no one wants to staxt it here.
It's been extremely cold here for the past month.
If there was something in The Daily about estab
lishing some day as "coat christening clay" it is be

lieved by this group that it might develop as a tra
dition. Jfow about it? We wear fur coats skiing, why
not to class?

Editor's liotp; Well, for what it's worth, we'll be
plait to proclaim today as "(Joui Christening Day,"
But sporty fur coats? To class?
