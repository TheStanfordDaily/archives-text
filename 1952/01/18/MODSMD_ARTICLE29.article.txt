Leaking roofs, flooded base
ments, and dropping plaster are
only a few of the many prob
lems confronting Carroll Black
er, Superintendent of Buildings
and Grounds and Corporation
Yazd head, in one of his average
office days.
The function of the Corp Yard,
according to Fixitman Blacker, is to
keep Stanford's educational and
residence buildings in operation
through constant repair. This task
enlists tli#? services of nine depart
ments, CTich handling a different
pait of the work.
Many Departments
The Plumbing Department is very
busy these days taking care of the
leaks and flooded banemnts all over
campus, while the I.abor and
Trucking Department help*: out by
removing fallen trees which block
traffic. During registration, Labor
and Trucking men move the neces
sary tables and chairs into the Pa
vilicr. and remove them that night
in preparation for a dance or a bas
ketball game.
Other necessary departments are
the Electric Shop, which keeps light
fixtures working all over campus,
and the Steam Plant, which is in
charge of the steam heat and hot
water which aie so welcome these
wintry days. Repair ot University
owned equipment is done by the
Repair and Machination Depart
ments.
The remainder of the Corp Yard
employees work in the Sheet Metal
Shop, the Painting and Glazing
Shop, and the Garden Department
Some work as custodians of Memo
rial Church.
' Odd Jobs
Betweefc quarters, Blacker's men
busy themselves with major paint
ing, refintshing, and repair jobs on
Quad and in the dorms. They also
do other pdd jobs assigned them by
the University.
Whenetfer he finds a money sur
plus, Blacker uses it for such things

as street repairs and tree pruning
which are not included in the gen
eral budget Tree topping and trim
ming became necessary when the
dead limbs of some of the un
trimmed trees began smashing on
parked cars.
In this stormy weather, the Corp
Yaid receives many phone < alls
from people who insist that a tree
neai them looks dangerous, and ask
him to have it trimmed immedi
ately.
"I'd like to take care of all these
requests," explains Blacker, "but it
would be impossible. Besides, you
can't, tell when a tree looks danger
our Why, many ol them look the
mo t solid the moment before they
tumble down I ''
People Appeal
The Corp Yard Supei intendenf';
office seems to be the first place
that people appeal to in every sort
of difficulty. For instance, four 'in

dents in Titern Hall complained that
then rooms were too hof. Investi
gation proved that they were .situ
ated directly above the boiler room.
The problem was solved by install
ing grills and tar.; to cool the
rooms.
One Corp Yard employee suf
fered a dunking in the performance
of his duty. In one of the recent
storms, a eucalyptus tree fell in a
<;reek near campus, with its top
hranches burying an inhabited
shack. In an effort to remove the
tree from the creek, one of the men
fell in the water. Then, afler all
that effort, the .'.hack's family ex
plained that theft house was con
demned and they would have had
to move out anyway.
When asked if he ever had to
tackle any impossible jobs, Bluckei
explained, "There are no impossible
jobs; some are just harder than
others."

The Plumbing Department is very
busy these days taking care of the
leaks and flooded banemnts all over
campus, while the I.abor and
Trucking Department help*: out by
removing fallen trees which block
traffic. During registration, Labor
and Trucking men move the neces
sary tables and chairs into the Pa
vilicr. and remove them that night
in preparation for a dance or a bas
ketball game.
Other necessary departments are
the Electric Shop, which keeps light
fixtures working all over campus,
and the Steam Plant, which is in
charge of the steam heat and hot
water which aie so welcome these
wintry days. Repair ot University
owned equipment is done by the
Repair and Machination Depart

The remainder of the Corp Yard
employees work in the Sheet Metal
Shop, the Painting and Glazing
Shop, and the Garden Department
Some work as custodians of Memo

busy themselves with major paint
