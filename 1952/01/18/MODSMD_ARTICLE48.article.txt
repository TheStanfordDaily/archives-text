### DICK MALTZMAN 
Alameda Air Station's muscle boys
j squeaked past the injury - riddled
j but ever strong Stanford wrestling
j team by a single poin, 1G to 15,
Wednesday night.
Stanford, handicapped by the loss
of Oliver Lyon, chunky ltitle 130-
j pounder rated the best in his class
I on'the coast, lost all four of the light
weight matches. Bob Neighbor, re
placing Lyons in the 130 lb. class,
came out for the team just two days
before the Alameda meet and was
pinned readily by Rudy Sanchez in
50 seconds.
Sailors Sweap Lightweights
In the 137 lb. class. Art Alexander
was pinned in 1 minute and 30 sec
onds by Ted Baldenston, their best
man. 800 Jessen lost a decision to
Bob James in the 147 lb. class and
Ken James lost a close split decision
to Howard 800 l in the 157 lb. class.
Thus, in the first four matches,
Alameda scored all their points and
assured themselves of victory. In
the Olympic wrestling rules, a team
! is given three points for a decision
j and five for a pin. To pin the op
! ponent, a wrestler has to make his
j opponent's shoulder touch the can
vas, a big difference from the three
| count rule used last year. There are
j three judges including the referee,
j and two at least must see the shoul
| der tojch. Decisions are scored on
j a two-out-of-three basis.

With Alameda leading 16-0, the
1 Stanford heavies came to the front
and scored three straight pins. Pat
j Madden, sensational frosh muscle
man wrestling in the 167 lb. class,
, pinned Jack Sweetring in 2 minutes
[ 30 seconds to enter our first win for
i the night.
Jack Oglesby, wrestling in the 177
j lb. class, came through to pin Bob
McFarling, Alameda's coach and
j mainstay, in three minutes, and Phil
Wilson, sharing honors for best var
; sity heavyweight with Rod Garner,
took Roy Smith of Alameda clown in
five minutes and 30 seconds. Final
score—l(s to 15.
This one point loss would probably
never have occurred if the rugged
little Lyons had been matched
against Sanchez in the 130-lb. bout
Neighbor, not in condition with but
one day's practice, was no match for
the little sailor, while Olie would
have been favored to take the con
test.
