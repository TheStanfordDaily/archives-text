# Flu Epidemic Hits Encina; Rest Home Full
## 
### 
Residents of Encina Hall com
plained today of a siege of what
the Student Health Service terms
a virus flu. Freshmen in all parts
of the hall have come down with
the illness and many are being con
fined to the Men's Rest Home.
Dr. George Houck, director of the
Health Service, said that the flu is
of the same type that has been
plaguing the Palo Alto area for the
past few years. Symptoms are fever
and nausea, followed by vomiting
and diarrhea.
The illness cannot be attributable
to food poisoning, Dr. Houck said,
as hundreds would have been af
flicted at the same time if poisoning
were responsible.
One explanation for the epidemic
is the heavy entertainment provided
for the freshmen duirng the current
fraternity and eating club rushing.
