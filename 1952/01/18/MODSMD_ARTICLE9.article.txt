WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP) —
Iho United States, Britain, and
their allies in Korea have "generally
agreed" to warn the Chinese Com
munists that the China mainland
will he bombed if they sign a truce
and then break it.
The United Nations decision was
tipped off by British Prime Minis
ter Winston Churchill in his address
to Congress and confirmed later to
day by other ofTicial sources.
Ihe United Nations decision
means that Red air bases, commu
nications centers, arsenals, power
plants, and other war - supporting
centers in Ifed China would be
bombed if the Reds broke a truce.
I lie strategy also calls for a pos
sible naval blockade coupled with
new ground offensives in Korea it- !
self.
Allied thinking does not include |
any invasion of China by UN troops
or Chinese Nationalist forces on
Formosa. The idea would be to
punish the Chinese by limited at- !
tacks on key installations rather |
than any wholesale bombing of Chi
nese cities and all-out attacks.
