# Young GOP Issue Goes to Sterling
## 
### 
The proposal to charter the
Young Republicans as an ASSU
club was referred back to President
Sterling and the student body for
further study Thursday by the
Board of Trustees.
The proposal went before the
board in the form of a recommen
dation from Excom that the Young
Republicans be allowed to meet on
campus and follow a primarily edu
cational political program.
Dr. Sterling said yesterday that
he had asked the board to take this
action because he wanted to study
the matter more himself.
"On actions of this type, I like to
deal directly with Excom and the
interested students," Dr. Sterling
said. He explained that he had been
unable to do so before the board
meeting.
Dr. Sterling said lie will meet
soon with Excom to discuss the
matter.
Under present and long standing
University rules, no political clubs
are allowed to hold meetings or
sponsor speakers at Stanford.
