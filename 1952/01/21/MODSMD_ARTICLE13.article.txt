Over the weekend the various
pledge classes have been consolida
ting and assuming their final pro
portions with the hesitants making
their decisions and the houses put
ting on last minute efforts to pin de

clusion that the overall pledge total
will approach if not surpass last
year's record 379.
The number Ls expected to run
high not because of the draft situa
tion, which had the entire campus
panicked last year, but because of
the relatively large number of out
