# Indian Five Crumbles, Drops Two to Trojans
## Old Southland Menace Puts Stanford in Division Cellar 
### LARRY CAHN 
USC took the wheels off the
Big Red Machine, and the In
dians, slowed to a walk, dropped
a pair of weekend, basketball
games. By such achievement,
Stanford replaced the twice-vic
torious Trojans as PCC Southern
Division cellar-dwellers.
Proving conclusively that the
Southland is not the place for Stan
ford athletic teams at this time of
year, USC nipped the Cards 63 to 58
in an overtime Friday night, and
had little trouble turning back the
disappointing Indians 75 to 64 Sat
urday. Stanford could not effective
ly penetrate a Trojan defense which
bottled the vaunted Card last break.
In Friday's game, Stanford, a 10-
point favorite, did not hit from the
floor until Jim Walsh connected af
ter six minutes of playing time had
elapued. The Trojans at this junc
ture had a comfortable four-point
lead.
Both Teams Cflf
Although both teams were off
their respective games, the Cards
were way, way off. At the end of
the first period of play the score
was USC 16, Stanford 8. Things
picked up during the second stanza
and the intermission score showed
the Trojans ahead, 37 to 33.
In the second half Stanford rut
and chooped at the Trojan lead,
and finally overtook SC, 56 to 55,
as Ron Tomsic hit from the key
with 45 seconds remaining.
The lead was short-lived, as Ken

Flower, brilliant Trojan forward
from San Francisco, was fouled ! v
Ed Tucker and sank the free throw
to knot the score. Stanford brought
the ball down the court and Tomiiic,
up to then Stanford's single shining
star, missed a lay-in as the final
gun sounded.
Stars Fouled Out
With Jim Walsh, Jim Rarnstead,
and Ed Tucker having left the gsme
via the five-foul route, USC had no
trouble out - shooting the Indians
seven to two in the overtime to
make the final score USC 63, Stan
ford 58. Trojan Jerry Pease hit four
points in the extra play.
Stanford, unusually cold, stayed
as close as they did to the Trojans
through no fault of their own. USC'-;
over - aggressiveness permitted tin:
Cards to hit 22 free throws while
SC only connected 11 times from
the charity line. But the Trojans
out-hit the Cards 26 field goals to
18 from the floor.

SC's Best Game

Saturday's game saw USC play
its best game of this still youn ;
campaign. The Trojans took full
advantage of all breaks and Stan
ford misoues. Both teams' shooting
improved over Friday, with both
clubs hitting just about 49 per cent
of their floor shoots.
The game was tight all the v/ay
until the third period. Stanford htld
a 37 to 36 half-time edge, but oh,
that third period; USC roared bad .
With Flower and Chuck Reilly hit
ting for nine and seven points le
spectively, the Trojans amassed a
63-48 score going into the last
quarter. They had no difficulty
holding off the Indians during the
final 10 minutes.
Coach Bob Burnett. had moved
guard Walsh to a forward spot and
iomsic to the guard slot Friday
night in an attempt to get more
height under the offensive buckct.
But any height advantage was nul
lified by Walsh's ineffectiveness to
hit from his new spot. He did score
16 Saturday night.
The losses can be attributed to
Stanford's coldness in shooting and
weakness on the backboards. How
ever, nothing can be taken away
from USC's stellar defense and
heads-up play.
