LOS ANGELES, -Tan. 70 (UP)- An
effort on the part of the Miami Junior
Chamber of Commerce to "aid Lo .
Angeles in its buttle against torren •
tial rains" proved to be a case of too
little too late when a shipment of
umbrellas arrived today to be greeted
by spotty sunshine.
Fred Walker, Jr., president of tb"
local civic organization, who whs on
hand to accept the "gifts" at in!.r>i
national airport, examined the um
brellas and promptly loaded them
aboard an eastbound plane with tho
following message for Miami:
"Appreciate your motives in al -
tempting to aid in our hour of reed,
but unbrellas evidently have been
used in one of Florida's many hum •
canes, for they arrived in windblown
and useless condition. However, ma
jority of native Angelenos have never
before seen umbrella, so will keep
one for display at our local museum."
