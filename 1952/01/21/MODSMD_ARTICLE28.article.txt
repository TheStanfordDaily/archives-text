The Young Republican matter is back where
it has been since Excom recommended the
club be allowed an ASSU chatter last Novem
ber. On the table.
The Board of Trustees referred the matter
back to President Sterling and the students for
further discussion upon Dr. Sterling's request.
It has been pointed out that the University
regulation against political meetings on cam
pus is over 50 years old. Such rules are not
changed overnight.
It has also been pointed out that 1952 is an
election year. Many students are interested in
politics and would like to see the whole issue
of political bans at Stanford opened for dis
cussion. The Young Republican issue, as all
parties must realize, is a sort ol test case to
determine if some midway policy can't be
found which would allow intelligent political
participation here.
We hope Dr. Sterling and Excom get to
gether soon. And that they accomplish some
thing.

Straight from the Village comes a reguest
that motorists think twice before roaring past
Village ride-seekers at the pick-up spots. Bet
ter yet, slow down and give the hitch-hikers
a lift.
As of this moment, all "Give Ride to Vil
lage" signs are up. No excuses left. Inci
dentally, the Village student who complained
said the worst bottleneck was at the Village
entrance where students have a tough time

getting a ride back to Stanford.

So an Eisenhower man appears, (see letter
below). We're glad to see the gentleman in a
mood to work for Ike's election, simply be
cause if enough Eisenhower organizations are
started, maybe the general will break down and
say "yes, because" instead of just "yes."
Of course it took many months of patient
persuading from some of the most patient per
suaders in Washington D.C. to get the general
to say a most hesitant and indirect "yes."
Now if he'l) just say "yes, because" —in
other words, if he'll take definite stands 011 im
portant issues—this will be a good campaign
yet.
Eisenhower might take a cue from Governor
Warren, who has suddenly developed into a
tough man in the league ol verbal warfare. The
governor was quoled as calling UC Regent
John Neyland a "spewer of venom" the other
day, which doesn't actually prove much except
that Warren doesn't think much of Taftman
Neyland. But the governor has been taking
more definite stands.
Now if Stanford students for Eisenhower and
the hundreds of Ike clubs springing up across
the nation will just get Eisenhower to say
where he stands on vital issues, they'll have
done a lot of good. We don't like to depend on
ancient Fourth of July speeches when casting
a vote. And we certainly hope the U.S. won't
elect a president simply because he's a nice
fellow with a nice smile.

Straight from the Village comes a reguest
that motorists think twice before roaring past
Village ride-seekers at the pick-up spots. Bet
ter yet, slow down and give the hitch-hikers
a lift.
As of this moment, all "Give Ride to Vil
lage" signs are up. No excuses left. Inci
dentally, the Village student who complained
said the worst bottleneck was at the Village
entrance where students have a tough time

getting a ride back to Stanford.

So an Eisenhower man appears, (see letter
below). We're glad to see the gentleman in a
mood to work for Ike's election, simply be
cause if enough Eisenhower organizations are
started, maybe the general will break down and
say "yes, because" instead of just "yes."
Of course it took many months of patient
persuading from some of the most patient per
suaders in Washington D.C. to get the general
to say a most hesitant and indirect "yes."
Now if he'l) just say "yes, because" —in
other words, if he'll take definite stands 011 im
portant issues—this will be a good campaign
yet.
Eisenhower might take a cue from Governor
Warren, who has suddenly developed into a
tough man in the league ol verbal warfare. The
governor was quoled as calling UC Regent
John Neyland a "spewer of venom" the other
day, which doesn't actually prove much except
that Warren doesn't think much of Taftman
Neyland. But the governor has been taking
more definite stands.
Now if Stanford students for Eisenhower and
the hundreds of Ike clubs springing up across
the nation will just get Eisenhower to say
where he stands on vital issues, they'll have
done a lot of good. We don't like to depend on
ancient Fourth of July speeches when casting
a vote. And we certainly hope the U.S. won't
elect a president simply because he's a nice
fellow with a nice smile.
The Young Republican matter is back where
it has been since Excom recommended the
club be allowed an ASSU chatter last Novem
ber. On the table.
The Board of Trustees referred the matter
back to President Sterling and the students for
further discussion upon Dr. Sterling's request.
It has been pointed out that the University
regulation against political meetings on cam
pus is over 50 years old. Such rules are not
changed overnight.
It has also been pointed out that 1952 is an
election year. Many students are interested in
politics and would like to see the whole issue
of political bans at Stanford opened for dis
cussion. The Young Republican issue, as all
parties must realize, is a sort ol test case to
determine if some midway policy can't be
found which would allow intelligent political
participation here.
We hope Dr. Sterling and Excom get to
gether soon. And that they accomplish some
thing.
