### DICK McLEAN 
A TRAGEDY
The gay party v/as just catching its second wind.
The music and the laughter sang louder than ever.
The bolder people were telling the funny stories that
they hadn't been able to remember earlier. The timid
wore no longer shy. By five minutes to two in the
morning everyone was everyone's bosom friend. 'Jlie
song of the gaiety and the night seemed timeless.
The pretty Stanford coed happened to g'ance at the
grandfather clock ticking in solo sobiiety in the cor
ner.
"My God!" she shrieked. "Look at the time, Wilbur.
I'll never get home on time. I've only got a two
thirty."

"It's only fifty miles," lie an- |
swered tensely." We can make it |
in thirty - five minutes if we s
hurry."
"We've-really-got-to-go-thank- t
you-for-a-nice . . . We're-a-bit- |
late," they shouted in a blur as |
they ran out the door.
The eight Oldsmobile cylinders *
roared their fullest as the sleek, I
green car spun a trail of rubber I
out of the driveway onto the I

street. Wilbur jammed his foot to the floorboard over
the accelerator. The speedometer needle climbed to
a hundred and there hovered, Pedestrians, police
cars, ambulances all fled as the green streak screamed
by.
The engineer 011 the Lark bad a distinct re
membrance of something like a big bird that crossed
ten feet in front of bis train about 2:05 in the morn
ing. A motorcycle cop was nearly killed when he
stepped oil his bike at 70 miles an hour. "I took out
after a speeder but he pulled away so fast that I
thought niy motorcycle bad stopped so I got olf to
sec what was tlie matter," he explained from bis
hospital bed.
"1 think we're liable to make it," Wilbur shouted
over the noise.
"Drive faster," his date said.
As Wilbur and his girl plunged headlong through
the night racing the eternal timeclock, another Stan
ford couple parked motionless but no less tense in
front of the gill's dorm. They were talking earnestly.
"M-M-Mary Beth, I would like to ask-ask you s
rornething," said Burt. (Burt stuttered.)
"Breath deeply," said Mary Beth. "You remember
what the doctor said about getting excited."
"Yes, d-dear," answered Burt neivously flipping

his pin in his hand.
A light shone in Mary Beth's eyes as she spotted
the pin. In fact, the light in her eyes v/as so bright
that it threw two beacons like a pair of flashlights.
The couple had been going together for four years
and Mary Beth had long waited for this moment.
"Spit it out, Burt," said Mary Befli noticing (hat
time was flying.
"W-well I've been kind of th-th-thinking that
we've Leen going together for a long time now and
. . . and . .
"Yes, Burt. Hurry."
"VV-w-would you 1-like t-to to . . ."
"Damnit. Take a deep breath, Burt."
"What time is it?" asked Burt an the battle of
sanity and insanity played football 011 his be
fuddled brain.
"Two twenty-eight," said Mary Beth. Stoicl.y
she picked up her purse, gave her lips a quick
slash with a lipstick, ari yanked a comb through
her hair. She knew the battle was lost. "Let's go,"
she snarled. "I'll be late."
The green hornet Old.smobile screechpd off a quar
ter inch of rubber in managing the turn from Fl Ca
mino onto Palm Drive. Palm Drive at 2:28 was a one
way speedway. Four abreast the cars raced and
jockied foi position. Anything corning down the drive
toward Palo Alto had long since taken to the ditch.
Wilbur was in the lead on the home stretch.
"I don't hear any more noise,'' said his date.
" We're on the other side of the supersonic barrier,"
Wilbur whispered.
The two couples: Bert and Mary Both, Wilbur and
his date, dashed the hundred yard from the street
to the door in ten seconds flat. As they reached the
door, the spiked overhead gate was descending.
"Dive for it," someone yelled.
They did. The girls were in on time. The race
was won.
But (and here is where the tragedy begins) Burt
was accidentally locked in by the spiked gate. He
had no other choice but to sign in—strangely no
one noticed that he was a male—and then try to
sneak out a window and over the wall.
As he reached the top of the wall, the building
searchlight caught him. The kindly looking lady at
the desk cranked off a quick hundred rounds from
her Thompson machinegun. Burt toppled from the
wall to the earth below sighing in his dying breath:
"Mv! Wouldn't if bf nirr if llirv jav*»
the gill* a littlr moie bnnot lime."
And died.
