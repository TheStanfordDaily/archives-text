# CAMPUS OPINION
## Students for 'Ike' Can Organize 
### 
To the Editor:
In this year, 19.12, we the people of the United States
will make a decision on the foreign and domestic
policies of our government which will affect the
peoples of all nations. It is my considered opinion
that, from among the several able aspirants of both
major political parties, Dwight Eisenhower is best
qualified to be our next president.
Having reached this decision, I intend to do some
thing about it. I wish to contact those who would like
to see Eisenhower nominated as a presidential can
didate and are willing to work for that end. My tele
phone number is DA 2-6740.

To the Editor:
We wholeheartedly add our agreement to the «ue

gestion proposed in The Daily on January 18. We,
too, have often wondered why Stanford {{iris, the
vast majority of whom have fur coats, never have a
chance to Haunt them. It seems a pity that our er
mines and sables must lie unused in moth balls or
fur storage. It is, of course, quite acceptable to don
our lush wraps while schussing down the slopes, so
why not on Quad.
Yes, Jean M., we too have our fur coats to keep us
waim. So let's all chiirten them together.
