# BRAVES
## Slaughter Menlo, Poly 
### 
Showing their flashiest form of
the season, the Stanford Braves
slaughtered Polytechnic High and
Menlo JC in weekend contests here.
First they disposed of Poly by an
89-53 count. Russ Lawler and Dick
Carver had both backboards cov
ered and the tough Card defense
forced Poly to hit from the out
side. Stanford, meanwhile, ran Poly
to death and made most of their
points on lay-ups. Lawler and Car
ver led the scoring with 17 and 15
points respectively. Jim Johnson,
who came off the bench to play
scintillating ball in both contests,
followed with 10.
The victory over Menlo was sweet
revenge for the Braves, who had
dropped a two-point heartbreaker
to the Menlomen a week before.
On Saturday, it was all Stanford
a.s they scored on easy 65-40 win.
Stanford's fast - break offense left
Menlo flat-footed and the contest
was never,, in doubt. Jim Johnson
scored 13 points and Bill Irvine 12,
to lead the scorers.
