## Madison Mutters 
### 
First off today we'd like to take off a bit on a manpower shortage that
exists on the Stanford campus despite the overwhelming ratio. The lack
is in chaps with a certain rather specialized ability—to be specific, boxing.
We'll grant that the Cards are at a disadvantage when it comes to
boxing because the average guy who has had experience in the ring before
he reaches the age when he usually decides that college is the place for
him is not the average Sam Stanford.
Nevertheless, the men who have turned out for the team are doing a
great job, and the match with Cal last Thursday eve furnishes ample evi
dence of what could be done with a little more manpower.
Of the six bouts that were actually fought with the Bears, the Card
boxers won three and drew a fourth. If it were not for the lack of
fighters in the three other weight classes, the Cards would have won the
match. Instead they lost what was in effect a forfeited match.
Part of the deficiency of fighters will be made up in future matches, as
Herb Cohen, who turned out too late to get in shape for the Cal match,
will box in the heavy weight slot from now on.
All of which leaves Coach Ray Lunny with a couple of pleas. One: for
experienced boxers to come out and either get in shape to try for spots
on the team for the rest of the season or at least to give the guys on the
squad a little sparring experience.
The other goes back to the fact that most of the present men on the team
have gained all or most of their boxing experience here on the Farm. You
need no experience or training'of any kind to take the elementary boxing
class. And Lunny would certainly like to see more men participating in
these classes, not only to learn boxing for its own sake but also because
these men form the foundation for future Stanford Boxing teams.
Why don't you drop around to see him?
CONDOLENCES OF THE WEEK: Assistant football Coach Dutch
Fehring has recently been placed in a cast which covers almost all of his
torso and head, leaving only a small space for his face to appear for air.
This has been done to clear up a crack in a vertebra at the base of his
neck, which Dutch apparently incurred long ago and which has only
recently been correctly diagnosed.
We wish him as comfortable and satisfactory a recovery as possible
during the eight weeks he is scheduled to be incapacitated.
OLYMPIC ITEM: Among the several Stanford Athletes who are train
ing for the Olympic games in various events are Jim Fifer, Dewey Hecht,
arirl Tim Rnrfrfc TKoir nrr> l-» r» n i r-» v% J rt

and Jim oeggs. ihey are beginning
training for what they hope will be
a successful attempt to represent the
United States in rowing — doubles
with coxswain.
Over Christmas vacation Beggs
purchased the shell which they will
use, and now with Fifer and Heeht
rowing and Beggs as cox, the trio
are commencing workouts. Fifer and
Hecht, however, are also continuing
to row for the Card varsity eight,
and if perchance the eight should
make the Olympics, they have in
dicated they would stick with it
rather than the doubles.
MOVIES, YOU OUGHT TO
SEE: Number one is "California
Skies," produced by Warren Miller,
which should provide a very enter
taining evening January 30th in Cub
berley Aud. The flick is rated as

both humorous and good skiing action, and along with it, we understand,
are being shown films of the U.S. Olympic trials. Your dough, by the way,
will go to benefit the Stanford Ski team, which being an orphan like the
crew, kind of could use it.
Number two, which will probably pop up again on the Peninsula in the
near future in case you missed it at the Stanford last week, is the "Harlem
Globetrotters." Although the action is fitted to the somewhat trite plot,
it is still tops and the ball handling antics of the Trotters are as enter
taining on celluloid as they are in person. If that isn't enough, Goose Tatum
is as funny a comic as we've seen in a long while.

First off today we'd like to take off a bit on a manpower shortage that
exists on the Stanford campus despite the overwhelming ratio. The lack
is in chaps with a certain rather specialized ability—to be specific, boxing.
We'll grant that the Cards are at a disadvantage when it comes to
boxing because the average guy who has had experience in the ring before
he reaches the age when he usually decides that college is the place for
him is not the average Sam Stanford.
Nevertheless, the men who have turned out for the team are doing a
great job, and the match with Cal last Thursday eve furnishes ample evi
dence of what could be done with a little more manpower.
Of the six bouts that were actually fought with the Bears, the Card
boxers won three and drew a fourth. If it were not for the lack of
fighters in the three other weight classes, the Cards would have won the
match. Instead they lost what was in effect a forfeited match.
Part of the deficiency of fighters will be made up in future matches, as
Herb Cohen, who turned out too late to get in shape for the Cal match,
will box in the heavy weight slot from now on.
All of which leaves Coach Ray Lunny with a couple of pleas. One: for
experienced boxers to come out and either get in shape to try for spots
on the team for the rest of the season or at least to give the guys on the
squad a little sparring experience.
The other goes back to the fact that most of the present men on the team
have gained all or most of their boxing experience here on the Farm. You
need no experience or training'of any kind to take the elementary boxing
class. And Lunny would certainly like to see more men participating in
these classes, not only to learn boxing for its own sake but also because
these men form the foundation for future Stanford Boxing teams.
Why don't you drop around to see him?
CONDOLENCES OF THE WEEK: Assistant football Coach Dutch
Fehring has recently been placed in a cast which covers almost all of his
torso and head, leaving only a small space for his face to appear for air.
This has been done to clear up a crack in a vertebra at the base of his
neck, which Dutch apparently incurred long ago and which has only
recently been correctly diagnosed.
We wish him as comfortable and satisfactory a recovery as possible
during the eight weeks he is scheduled to be incapacitated.
OLYMPIC ITEM: Among the several Stanford Athletes who are train
ing for the Olympic games in various events are Jim Fifer, Dewey Hecht,
arirl Tim Rnrfrfc TKoir nrr> l-» r» n i r-» v% J rt

and Jim oeggs. ihey are beginning
training for what they hope will be
a successful attempt to represent the
United States in rowing — doubles
with coxswain.
Over Christmas vacation Beggs
purchased the shell which they will
use, and now with Fifer and Heeht
rowing and Beggs as cox, the trio
are commencing workouts. Fifer and
Hecht, however, are also continuing
to row for the Card varsity eight,
and if perchance the eight should
make the Olympics, they have in
dicated they would stick with it
rather than the doubles.
MOVIES, YOU OUGHT TO
SEE: Number one is "California
Skies," produced by Warren Miller,
which should provide a very enter
taining evening January 30th in Cub
berley Aud. The flick is rated as

both humorous and good skiing action, and along with it, we understand,
are being shown films of the U.S. Olympic trials. Your dough, by the way,
will go to benefit the Stanford Ski team, which being an orphan like the
crew, kind of could use it.
Number two, which will probably pop up again on the Peninsula in the
near future in case you missed it at the Stanford last week, is the "Harlem
Globetrotters." Although the action is fitted to the somewhat trite plot,
it is still tops and the ball handling antics of the Trotters are as enter
taining on celluloid as they are in person. If that isn't enough, Goose Tatum
is as funny a comic as we've seen in a long while.
