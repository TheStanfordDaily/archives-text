# Cubberley: Gift of a Versatile Man
## 
### DOROTHY DODGE 
Crossing from the Bookstore,
walking under the arches, and
entering the red-tiled lobby, you
know you're going to Cubber
ley Auditorium. Perhaps later
you climb the stairs and study a
while in the big book-lined li
brary and you know that too is
called "Cubberley."
But do you know that the walls,
the windows, the shelves are only
the physical part of a story, the
story of a couple's devotion to a
University.
El wood Patterson Cubberley was
Dean of the Stanford School of Ed
ucation from 1898 to 1933, and was
retired when he died in 1941. Mrs.
Cubberley is still living and con
tinues to be one of Stanford's great
est benefactors—as will testify the
graduate women who live with her
in the home she opened to them and
which was called "Hilltop" and is
now called Cubberley House.
It was the Cubhtvrleys who
nave the entire $538,000 Educa
tion Building 1 to Stanford, and
who have also contributed to fel
lowships and library funds. But
the chances arc that even with
out these concrete gifts, the Cub
berley name would have lived on
at Stanford by reputation alone.
Anioiv* those who knew Profes
sor Cubberley, the consensus is
that he was a remarkable man.
Ilere arc a few illustrations:
When the Cubberleys were mar
ried in 1892, a financial panic had

closed their bank. They began their
honeymoon with 35 cents. Sixty
years later, their gifts to Stanford
totaled more than $772,000.
When Dean Cubberley died in
1941, the University Academic
Council wrote:
"lie developed courses in new
fields, taught thousands of stu
dents, gave innumerable public
addresses, served on important
educational commissions, edited a
great textbook scvics, and wrote
20 volumes covering almost every

phase of school administration
and the history of education."
Adin Henderson, an education
graduate student who is now doing
his doctoral dissertation on the
dean, found evidence of the educa
tor's remarkable meticulousness and
attention to detail. Cubberley wrote
down every step of his life on cal
endar pads, kept financial records
in minute detail, listed all the major
facts about his cars, and even re
corded data on his lectures.
Professor Cubberley first came

to Stanford at the request of Uni
versity President David Starr
Jordan, who had been his teacher
at Indiana University.
The School of Education in Dean
Cubberley's day was located just
east of Memorial Church. After re
organizing the school in 1917 and
watching it outgrow its quarters, he
realized how badly more space was
needed. So with money earned from
his writing and investment in
stocks and bonds, he and Mrs. Cub
berley gave the University the pres
ent Education Building. The entire
structure is not titled "Cubberley"
at their specific request, but the
auditorium and library bear their
name by special vote of the Eoard
of Trustees.
Architecture was one of the
dean's many talents, so he drew
the complete plans for the build
ing himself. Earlier, in 1908, when
he had designed his Santa Ynez
Street home, the builder had of
fered him a full partnership in his
business.
Professor Ca'oberley virtually
took the building under his wing.
He personally supervised every
step in its construction, from decid
ing on the number of windows to
picking out the furniture.
Dean Cubberley also had a sense
of humor. His wife was active in
the Stanford Dames, and the day
after he recorded on his calendar
pad that .she was entertaining them,
he reported that she was suffering
from a "darned cold." In 1923 he
commented that for the past week
he had been "acting president, but
scarcely knew it nor did anyone
else."
For recreation, he wrote, stud
ied geneolorry, collected poems,
and puttered with his car. He
liked to travel and even to take
Sunday drives. Going to La Hon
da and Santa Cruz and then
coming home by San Jose was
one of his favorite routes.
The Cubberleys were well loved
by the students. Their home at the
head of Santa Ynez was often the
scene of entertainments for stu
dents, faculty, and other visitors.
But of all the tributes which can
be paid the late dean, perhaps he
would have liked best what the
Academic Council said after he
died: "He was a truly great teach
er." •

The School of Education in Dean
Cubberley's day was located just
east of Memorial Church. After re
organizing the school in 1917 and
watching it outgrow its quarters, he
realized how badly more space was
needed. So with money earned from
his writing and investment in
stocks and bonds, he and Mrs. Cub
berley gave the University the pres
ent Education Building. The entire
structure is not titled "Cubberley"
at their specific request, but the
auditorium and library bear their
name by special vote of the Eoard
of Trustees.
Architecture was one of the
dean's many talents, so he drew
the complete plans for the build
ing himself. Earlier, in 1908, when
he had designed his Santa Ynez
Street home, the builder had of
fered him a full partnership in his
business.
Professor Ca'oberley virtually
took the building under his wing.
He personally supervised every
step in its construction, from decid
ing on the number of windows to
picking out the furniture.
Dean Cubberley also had a sense
of humor. His wife was active in
the Stanford Dames, and the day
after he recorded on his calendar
pad that .she was entertaining them,
he reported that she was suffering
from a "darned cold." In 1923 he
commented that for the past week
he had been "acting president, but
scarcely knew it nor did anyone
else."
For recreation, he wrote, stud
ied geneolorry, collected poems,
and puttered with his car. He
liked to travel and even to take
Sunday drives. Going to La Hon
da and Santa Cruz and then
coming home by San Jose was
one of his favorite routes.
The Cubberleys were well loved
by the students. Their home at the
head of Santa Ynez was often the
scene of entertainments for stu
dents, faculty, and other visitors.
But of all the tributes which can
be paid the late dean, perhaps he
would have liked best what the
Academic Council said after he
died: "He was a truly great teach
er." •


STANFORD BENEFACTOR — Here is pictured the late Dean
Cubberley. Cubberley taught in Stanford's School of Education
in 1917. Thanks to his concern for the department's cramped
quarters, students now enjoy the present Cubberley Auditorium.
Crossing from the Bookstore,
walking under the arches, and
entering the red-tiled lobby, you
know you're going to Cubber
ley Auditorium. Perhaps later
you climb the stairs and study a
while in the big book-lined li
brary and you know that too is
called "Cubberley."
But do you know that the walls,
the windows, the shelves are only
the physical part of a story, the
story of a couple's devotion to a
University.
El wood Patterson Cubberley was
Dean of the Stanford School of Ed
ucation from 1898 to 1933, and was
retired when he died in 1941. Mrs.
Cubberley is still living and con
tinues to be one of Stanford's great
est benefactors—as will testify the
graduate women who live with her
in the home she opened to them and
which was called "Hilltop" and is
now called Cubberley House.
It was the Cubhtvrleys who
nave the entire $538,000 Educa
tion Building 1 to Stanford, and
who have also contributed to fel
lowships and library funds. But
the chances arc that even with
out these concrete gifts, the Cub
berley name would have lived on
at Stanford by reputation alone.
Anioiv* those who knew Profes
sor Cubberley, the consensus is
that he was a remarkable man.
Ilere arc a few illustrations:
When the Cubberleys were mar
ried in 1892, a financial panic had

closed their bank. They began their
honeymoon with 35 cents. Sixty
years later, their gifts to Stanford
totaled more than $772,000.
When Dean Cubberley died in
1941, the University Academic
Council wrote:
"lie developed courses in new
fields, taught thousands of stu
dents, gave innumerable public
addresses, served on important
educational commissions, edited a
great textbook scvics, and wrote
20 volumes covering almost every

phase of school administration
and the history of education."
Adin Henderson, an education
graduate student who is now doing
his doctoral dissertation on the
dean, found evidence of the educa
tor's remarkable meticulousness and
attention to detail. Cubberley wrote
down every step of his life on cal
endar pads, kept financial records
in minute detail, listed all the major
facts about his cars, and even re
corded data on his lectures.
Professor Cubberley first came

to Stanford at the request of Uni
versity President David Starr
Jordan, who had been his teacher
at Indiana University.

But do you know that the walls,
the windows, the shelves are only
the physical part of a story, the
story of a couple's devotion to a
University.
El wood Patterson Cubberley was
Dean of the Stanford School of Ed
ucation from 1898 to 1933, and was
retired when he died in 1941. Mrs.
Cubberley is still living and con
tinues to be one of Stanford's great
est benefactors—as will testify the
graduate women who live with her
in the home she opened to them and
which was called "Hilltop" and is
now called Cubberley House.
It was the Cubhtvrleys who
nave the entire $538,000 Educa
tion Building 1 to Stanford, and
who have also contributed to fel
lowships and library funds. But
the chances arc that even with
out these concrete gifts, the Cub
berley name would have lived on
at Stanford by reputation alone.
Anioiv* those who knew Profes
sor Cubberley, the consensus is
that he was a remarkable man.
Ilere arc a few illustrations:
When the Cubberleys were mar
ried in 1892, a financial panic had

closed their bank. They began their
honeymoon with 35 cents. Sixty
years later, their gifts to Stanford
totaled more than $772,000.
When Dean Cubberley died in
1941, the University Academic
Council wrote:
"lie developed courses in new
fields, taught thousands of stu
dents, gave innumerable public
addresses, served on important
educational commissions, edited a
great textbook scvics, and wrote
20 volumes covering almost every

phase of school administration
and the history of education."
Adin Henderson, an education
graduate student who is now doing
his doctoral dissertation on the
dean, found evidence of the educa
tor's remarkable meticulousness and
attention to detail. Cubberley wrote
down every step of his life on cal
endar pads, kept financial records
in minute detail, listed all the major
facts about his cars, and even re
corded data on his lectures.
Professor Cubberley first came

to Stanford at the request of Uni
versity President David Starr
Jordan, who had been his teacher
at Indiana University.
The School of Education in Dean
Cubberley's day was located just
east of Memorial Church. After re
organizing the school in 1917 and
watching it outgrow its quarters, he
realized how badly more space was
needed. So with money earned from
his writing and investment in
stocks and bonds, he and Mrs. Cub
berley gave the University the pres
ent Education Building. The entire
structure is not titled "Cubberley"
at their specific request, but the
auditorium and library bear their
name by special vote of the Eoard
of Trustees.
Architecture was one of the
dean's many talents, so he drew
the complete plans for the build
ing himself. Earlier, in 1908, when
he had designed his Santa Ynez
Street home, the builder had of
fered him a full partnership in his
business.
Professor Ca'oberley virtually
took the building under his wing.
He personally supervised every
step in its construction, from decid
ing on the number of windows to
picking out the furniture.
Dean Cubberley also had a sense
of humor. His wife was active in
the Stanford Dames, and the day
after he recorded on his calendar
pad that .she was entertaining them,
he reported that she was suffering
from a "darned cold." In 1923 he
commented that for the past week
he had been "acting president, but
scarcely knew it nor did anyone
else."
For recreation, he wrote, stud
ied geneolorry, collected poems,
and puttered with his car. He
liked to travel and even to take
Sunday drives. Going to La Hon
da and Santa Cruz and then
coming home by San Jose was
one of his favorite routes.
The Cubberleys were well loved
by the students. Their home at the
head of Santa Ynez was often the
scene of entertainments for stu
dents, faculty, and other visitors.
But of all the tributes which can
be paid the late dean, perhaps he
would have liked best what the
Academic Council said after he
died: "He was a truly great teach
er." •


STANFORD BENEFACTOR — Here is pictured the late Dean
Cubberley. Cubberley taught in Stanford's School of Education
in 1917. Thanks to his concern for the department's cramped
quarters, students now enjoy the present Cubberley Auditorium.
Crossing from the Bookstore,
walking under the arches, and
entering the red-tiled lobby, you
know you're going to Cubber
ley Auditorium. Perhaps later
you climb the stairs and study a
while in the big book-lined li
brary and you know that too is
called "Cubberley."
