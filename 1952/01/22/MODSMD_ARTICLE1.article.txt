# Rush Week Ends; 379 Join Stanford Fraternities
## Total Equals 1951 Record Pledge Class 
### WALT MENNINGER 
It's all over now. And 379 pledges, 24 rushing chairmen, one Inter
fraternity Council president, and innumerable fraternity men are thank
ful. Last night at 8:23 in the Nitery, the last pledge put his John Henry
on the line and two hectic weeks of the 1952 rushing season were
brought to a elo^e.
Equaling the all-time pledge class of 379 last year, this year's class
saw only one house garner less than ten men, while six fraternities gave
pins to twenty or more pledges. Delta Tau Delta, with 25 signers, headed
the list, and Phi Kappa Psi trailed with only five neophytes.
The culminating phase of "The Big Rush, 1952 style" began at 7 last
night when actives and pledges from Alpha Kappa Lambda surrounded
IFC President Tony Garrett in the Nitery. From that moment on, there
was little rest for the IFC head, as he supervised the signing of another
record pledge class. Kappa Alpha was the last house to turn in a list
of its newly pinned members.

Commenting on tliis year's rushing period, most rushing chairmen
agreed that on the whole, "it was a lot quieter" and "more orderly" than
in previous years. There was no great sudden accumulation of pledges
by any one house. The pledging rather was more gradual than in the
last few years.
The rushing period this year was in direct contrast to last year when
a frantic two weeks was had by all. Last year the fraternities, worried
over predicted losses to the draft, easily filled their houses.
This year, although there was no panic from the draft or the world
situation as a whole, the houses still went after large classes. The Class
of '55 "impressed" many of the fraternity members as a "strong class."
A surprising factor in the 1952 rushing period was the fact that the
men of '55 "took their time" in pledging. As a result, this year for the
first time in recent years, there was little or no pledge jumping. As one
Row resident commented, this year the pledges "used their heads."
Part of this was due to the fact that many of the freshmen waited
to see who was in which pledge class before making their final choice.
Also indicative of the calmer attitude was the comment of one pledge
who felt that the fraternity men didn't try to "shanghai any men" into
pledging.
Last night, events at the Nitery proceeded smoothly, marred only by
the "mystery of the missing pledge cards." IFC head Garrett, who
started the evening with some 650 pledge cards, finished approximately
50 short. He is still puzzling over the difference between the 379 signees
and the card shortage.

At preferential dinners some houses enjoyed a special meal when
maids waited on the pledges and actives. Girls from Roble were re
cruited to serve as hashers for the dinners at various fraternities as the
final luxury of the rushing season.
At the end of the evening, the rushing chairmen returned to their
houses to hit either their books or the hay for the first undisturbed rest
of the quarter. However, one energetic rushing chairman, sporting
bloodshot eyes as his evidence of fatigue, went out to enjoy a game of
basketball—a la intramural.
Some fraternity men jokingly talked over the possibility of "setting
up beds in the back yard" to accommodate the large pledge class. Yet,
the general theme of the conversation always turned to the subject of
studies—"l've only studied six hours this quarter"—and sleep—"Ah, for
a good night's rest!"
All in all, both the fraternities and the freshmen were quite satisfied

with the results of the two weeks of rushing. Although the period was
a "bit of a strain," all felt it was worth it.
While the draft was not as much a determinant of the pledge class
size as last year, it was nevertheless not forgotten. Chief Counselor for
Men Richard Ealch explained that all Stanford men who are thoughtful
of their obligations to fraternities and other organizations should care
fully consider their draft status.
Future prospects of the draft situation do not look as dim as they
did at this time last year. The possibility of a program of universal
military training as now proposed would not affect men now in college,
but it would rather drain off the incoming students—the 18-year-olds.

Tomorrow s Daily will carry reports of eating club pledging. Due
to space limitations, it was necessary to omit this news in today's
paper.

In fact, UMT would be a boon to the college student by cutting the
number of men needed by the draft.
The reported size of this year's pledge class was set yesterday at 3
p.m. at almost 400. But alter the preferential dinners, some rushing
chairmen were forced to revise their estimates. Garrett explained that
the number of pledges will probably rise in the coming quarter some
what, as some of the smaller classes will pick up more members.
