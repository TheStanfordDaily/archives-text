## 
### 
Jack W. Shoup, alumni direc
tor, said that in spite of a slight
delay caused by rain it is hoped
that Bowman House, located
across Santa Teresa from the
Firehouse, will be completed
sometime during April and
ready to welcome returning
Stanford alumni.
At an Executive Board meeting
last Saturday in San Francisco, Mrs.
Frank L. Gerbode, chairman, dis
played samples of furniture and
drapery to be used, because while
the offices of the Alumni Associa
tion will be found in the building,

the major part will be devoted to a
lounge, kitchenette, and a terrace
with barbecue facilities for the con
venience and enjoyment of the
graduates.
The house, dedicated Big Game
morning, was made possible by
$35,600 in gifts already on hand and
by a $20,000 gift provided in the
will of Guy C. Bowman, Reno, Nev.
A house-warming celebration will
be held in the spring and all the
alumni invited to visit.
Shoup pointed out that the com
pletion of Bowman House should be
of interest to the present students
who belong to the association as
well as to the alumni. It gives all
members a place to go whether or
not they are affiliated with a fra
ternity or eating club. They all
have Stanford in common.
