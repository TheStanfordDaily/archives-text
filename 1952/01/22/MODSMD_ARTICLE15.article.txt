# Rain Darkens Polo Horizon
## 
### JOHANNE MARTZ 
The polo team is praying for
something besides all this liquid
sunshine. Two weeks ago they
transported themselves and their
horses to Los Angeles to compete in
the Eight- and Twelve-Goal Tour
naments at the Beverly Hills Polo
Club. The games were postponed
because of rain.
The team came back to Stanford,
but their 14 horses were left—some
of them up to their knees in water.
The polo team, like ski team and
crew, is self-supporting. Each play
er must feed, lodge, pnd transport
himself as well as three horses
when he goes away for games. Jf
it doesn't stop raining —
The optimist on the team, Coach
Allen Ross, says Stanford will play
its Eight - Goal games Friday and
Sunday.
Other teams entered are from
| Santa Barbara, Pasadena, end two
I from Bev» t ly I Tills.
j In the Twelve-Goal Tournament
S' mford will play again t rome of
I l;i" highest- rated players in Amcr
j ica, including Bob Skene, one of
Jic two 10-goalers.
