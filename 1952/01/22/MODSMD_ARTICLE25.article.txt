# Fraternities to Start Pledge Dance Parade This Weekend
## 
### 
With the close of formal rushing,
thoughts of fraternity men turned
not only back to books and school
activities, but also to the first house
I'unctioas in which the new pledges
will participate the pledge proms.
As of last night, Nancy Erwin,
ASSU vice-president, was able to
report the dates and locations of
only nine ol these, but the remain
ing houses are expected to register
their dances soon.
The parade of pledge dances will
begin this weekend with the Alpha
Sigs and Theta Xi both hosting
theirs Friday night. On Saturday
evening Theta Chi will hold its
prom at the City of Paris Garden
Club in San Mateo, and the Chi
Psi's, the ATO's, and the DU's will
also gather to honor their pledges.
Zeta Psi will also host its pledge

dance Saturday at the Devonshire
Country Club.
Feb. 2 the Alpha Delts will host
their prom, and also the Fijis, the
latter holding theirs at L'Omelette.
Although the rest of the dances
have not yet been registered, most
of them will probably be held on
one of the foregoing dates at a se
lected spot on the Peninsula.
