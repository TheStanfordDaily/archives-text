### PETE GROTHE 
''SOME WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING"
To most of those involved, rushing is a dead-serious
proposition. And yet, in any situation, no matter how
serious it may seem, elements of humor can always
be gleaned. One of the most tragically funny parts
of rushing is when the rusher and rushee awkwardly
grope for conversation topics when all subjects have
already been explored.
Picture if you will, a rushee, whom we'll call
Herman, and two fraternity or eating club rushers,
...i »n ii n:11 i T l-

whom we'll call Bill and Jack.
Dinner is just over, and Bill
and Jack (on order of the rush
ing chairman) sit down in a cor
ner with Herman to chew the fat.
Herman is a hot prospect, being
number one man on the freshman
fencing team.
Nine times out of nine, the
first subject of conversation will
be the weather. "Well, this is
some weather we've been hav
ing, isn't it?"

This may be said by one or all three at the same
time.
The weather is good for at least ten minutes.
Herman remembers that he stepped in a puddle near
the history corner, thereby soiling the pair of argyles
his girl made for him last month.
"I hope they're not ruined." says Bill, straining
to conceal the fact that he really doesn't give a
damn.
"Yeah, I hope they're okay," adds Jack.
Jack remembers that he saw a car stalled by the
side of the road, because it went through some deep
water, and Herman says that he thinks more rain is
on the way.
Bill, having nothing more to contribute on the sub
ject of weather, repeats, "Yessir, some weather we've
been having lately."
Jack winds up the whole subject by saying some
thing witty like "Well, everyone talks about the
weather, but no one ever does anything about it."
Bill and Herman laugh a hollow type of laugh, as if
someone told the joke that they were just about to tell.
There is a short pause, while someone figures out
the next conversation piece. Bill remembers that no
one has asked Herman where he is from, and so he
says, "Where ya from, Herman?"
"Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Didja hear that, Jack? Herman, here, is from
Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Why," asks Herman, "Do you know someone in

Burnt Stump?"
"No," says Bill, "but I know a guy in Kansas
City. His name's Frank Sourwell. You know
Frank?"
"No, don't believe I do. Kansas City is about a
thousand miles from Burnt Stump."
"Oh," says Bill, giving up his end of the conver
sation.
There is another pause.
"Yessir, some weather we've been having lately,"
offers Bill. Everyone smiles a sickly kind of smile,
and there is a longer pause in which Herman clears
his throat several times.
Herman then tells Bill and Jack that be is an elec
trical engineering major, and then reports in detail
about an intricate experiment he is working on. Bill
and Jack are speech and drama majors, know nothing
about electrical engineering, and care less. During
Herman's discourse, they ask unintelligent questions
and coo appreciatively, saying such things as, "Izat
so?" and "well, whatta you know?"
Herman finishes, and Bill remembers that no one
has mentioned the weather in several minutes. "Yes
sir, some weather we've been having lately."
A !J'J second pause follows in which everyone takes
turns at clearing his throat.
"Say, you're living over at Encina, aren't you.
Herman?" queries Jack.
"Yeah."
"Then you must know Grant Swingely."
"Sure, I know Grant."
"He's a good head," offers Jack.
"Yeah, really a great guy," chips in Bill.
"Do you know Harry Appling over there," asks
Bill.
"Yeah, really a good head."
"Sure is a great guy," adds Jack.
This goes on for several minutes until all mutual
acquaintances have been written off as either a "good
head" or a "great guy." Having exhausted all avail
able topics of conversation, the three sit stiffy with
their hands on their laps. They are frankly talked out.
After several minutes of this, each minute seeming
like an hour, Herman allows that it is getting late
and that he really must return to Encina to do his
Western civ. Jack mentions something about it still
being early, but he is sure not to say it too loud, lest
Herman hear him. If Herman hears him, he pretends
not to.
Herman rushes for his coat, shakes hands, thanks
Bill and Jack, and leaves. As he goes out the door,
Bill shouts, "Be sure to button up that overcoat,
'ibis is some weather we've been having lately."

so?" and "well, whatta you know?"
Herman finishes, and Bill remembers that no one
has mentioned the weather in several minutes. "Yes
sir, some weather we've been having lately."
A !J'J second pause follows in which everyone takes
turns at clearing his throat.
"Say, you're living over at Encina, aren't you.
Herman?" queries Jack.
"Yeah."
"Then you must know Grant Swingely."
"Sure, I know Grant."
"He's a good head," offers Jack.
"Yeah, really a great guy," chips in Bill.
"Do you know Harry Appling over there," asks
Bill.
"Yeah, really a good head."
"Sure is a great guy," adds Jack.
This goes on for several minutes until all mutual
acquaintances have been written off as either a "good
head" or a "great guy." Having exhausted all avail
able topics of conversation, the three sit stiffy with
their hands on their laps. They are frankly talked out.
After several minutes of this, each minute seeming
like an hour, Herman allows that it is getting late
and that he really must return to Encina to do his
Western civ. Jack mentions something about it still
being early, but he is sure not to say it too loud, lest
Herman hear him. If Herman hears him, he pretends
not to.
Herman rushes for his coat, shakes hands, thanks
Bill and Jack, and leaves. As he goes out the door,
Bill shouts, "Be sure to button up that overcoat,
'ibis is some weather we've been having lately."

''SOME WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING"
To most of those involved, rushing is a dead-serious
proposition. And yet, in any situation, no matter how
serious it may seem, elements of humor can always
be gleaned. One of the most tragically funny parts
of rushing is when the rusher and rushee awkwardly
grope for conversation topics when all subjects have
already been explored.
Picture if you will, a rushee, whom we'll call
Herman, and two fraternity or eating club rushers,
...i »n ii n:11 i T l-

whom we'll call Bill and Jack.
Dinner is just over, and Bill
and Jack (on order of the rush
ing chairman) sit down in a cor
ner with Herman to chew the fat.
Herman is a hot prospect, being
number one man on the freshman
fencing team.
Nine times out of nine, the
first subject of conversation will
be the weather. "Well, this is
some weather we've been hav
ing, isn't it?"

This may be said by one or all three at the same
time.
The weather is good for at least ten minutes.
Herman remembers that he stepped in a puddle near
the history corner, thereby soiling the pair of argyles
his girl made for him last month.
"I hope they're not ruined." says Bill, straining
to conceal the fact that he really doesn't give a
damn.
"Yeah, I hope they're okay," adds Jack.
Jack remembers that he saw a car stalled by the
side of the road, because it went through some deep
water, and Herman says that he thinks more rain is
on the way.
Bill, having nothing more to contribute on the sub
ject of weather, repeats, "Yessir, some weather we've
been having lately."
Jack winds up the whole subject by saying some
thing witty like "Well, everyone talks about the
weather, but no one ever does anything about it."
Bill and Herman laugh a hollow type of laugh, as if
someone told the joke that they were just about to tell.
There is a short pause, while someone figures out
the next conversation piece. Bill remembers that no
one has asked Herman where he is from, and so he
says, "Where ya from, Herman?"
"Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Didja hear that, Jack? Herman, here, is from
Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Why," asks Herman, "Do you know someone in

Burnt Stump?"
"No," says Bill, "but I know a guy in Kansas
City. His name's Frank Sourwell. You know
Frank?"
"No, don't believe I do. Kansas City is about a
thousand miles from Burnt Stump."
"Oh," says Bill, giving up his end of the conver
sation.
There is another pause.
"Yessir, some weather we've been having lately,"
offers Bill. Everyone smiles a sickly kind of smile,
and there is a longer pause in which Herman clears
his throat several times.
Herman then tells Bill and Jack that be is an elec
trical engineering major, and then reports in detail
about an intricate experiment he is working on. Bill
and Jack are speech and drama majors, know nothing
about electrical engineering, and care less. During
Herman's discourse, they ask unintelligent questions
and coo appreciatively, saying such things as, "Izat
so?" and "well, whatta you know?"

ject of weather, repeats, "Yessir, some weather we've
been having lately."
Jack winds up the whole subject by saying some
thing witty like "Well, everyone talks about the
weather, but no one ever does anything about it."
Bill and Herman laugh a hollow type of laugh, as if
someone told the joke that they were just about to tell.
There is a short pause, while someone figures out
the next conversation piece. Bill remembers that no
one has asked Herman where he is from, and so he
says, "Where ya from, Herman?"
"Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Didja hear that, Jack? Herman, here, is from
Burnt Stump, lowa."
"Why," asks Herman, "Do you know someone in

Burnt Stump?"
"No," says Bill, "but I know a guy in Kansas
City. His name's Frank Sourwell. You know
Frank?"
"No, don't believe I do. Kansas City is about a
thousand miles from Burnt Stump."
"Oh," says Bill, giving up his end of the conver
sation.
There is another pause.
"Yessir, some weather we've been having lately,"
offers Bill. Everyone smiles a sickly kind of smile,
and there is a longer pause in which Herman clears
his throat several times.
Herman then tells Bill and Jack that be is an elec
trical engineering major, and then reports in detail
about an intricate experiment he is working on. Bill
and Jack are speech and drama majors, know nothing
about electrical engineering, and care less. During
Herman's discourse, they ask unintelligent questions
and coo appreciatively, saying such things as, "Izat
so?" and "well, whatta you know?"
Herman finishes, and Bill remembers that no one
has mentioned the weather in several minutes. "Yes
sir, some weather we've been having lately."
A !J'J second pause follows in which everyone takes
turns at clearing his throat.
"Say, you're living over at Encina, aren't you.
Herman?" queries Jack.
"Yeah."
"Then you must know Grant Swingely."
"Sure, I know Grant."
"He's a good head," offers Jack.
"Yeah, really a great guy," chips in Bill.
"Do you know Harry Appling over there," asks
Bill.
"Yeah, really a good head."
"Sure is a great guy," adds Jack.
This goes on for several minutes until all mutual
acquaintances have been written off as either a "good
head" or a "great guy." Having exhausted all avail
able topics of conversation, the three sit stiffy with
their hands on their laps. They are frankly talked out.
After several minutes of this, each minute seeming
like an hour, Herman allows that it is getting late
and that he really must return to Encina to do his
Western civ. Jack mentions something about it still
being early, but he is sure not to say it too loud, lest
Herman hear him. If Herman hears him, he pretends
not to.
Herman rushes for his coat, shakes hands, thanks
Bill and Jack, and leaves. As he goes out the door,
Bill shouts, "Be sure to button up that overcoat,
'ibis is some weather we've been having lately."

''SOME WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING"
To most of those involved, rushing is a dead-serious
proposition. And yet, in any situation, no matter how
serious it may seem, elements of humor can always
be gleaned. One of the most tragically funny parts
of rushing is when the rusher and rushee awkwardly
grope for conversation topics when all subjects have
already been explored.
Picture if you will, a rushee, whom we'll call
Herman, and two fraternity or eating club rushers,
...i »n ii n:11 i T l-

whom we'll call Bill and Jack.
Dinner is just over, and Bill
and Jack (on order of the rush
ing chairman) sit down in a cor
ner with Herman to chew the fat.
Herman is a hot prospect, being
number one man on the freshman
fencing team.
Nine times out of nine, the
first subject of conversation will
be the weather. "Well, this is
some weather we've been hav
ing, isn't it?"

This may be said by one or all three at the same
time.
The weather is good for at least ten minutes.
Herman remembers that he stepped in a puddle near
the history corner, thereby soiling the pair of argyles
his girl made for him last month.
"I hope they're not ruined." says Bill, straining
to conceal the fact that he really doesn't give a
damn.
"Yeah, I hope they're okay," adds Jack.
Jack remembers that he saw a car stalled by the
side of the road, because it went through some deep
water, and Herman says that he thinks more rain is
on the way.
