# Punts and Pitches; Football Cleanup

### PETE GROTHE 
By now the last sweat - stained
football jersey and battered helmet
has been stored away and some of
the biterness of the Rose Bowl de
feat has faded.
(And as the Old Boy says)
"NOW THAT" we are able to look
at the football season with a rea
sonable degree of detachment, we
would like to do one final piece on
the 1951 Stanford team and try to
put it in its proper peg.
Our PCC championship squad
was not a great team as great teams
go. We thought at one time that it
was. But you can't lose to Cal by
13 points and get mutilated on the
scoreboard by Illinois and still be a
great team.
After the Pasadena afTair, some
•said Stanford never had it in the
first place. Dick Ilyland men
tioned something about the Stan
ford team having tun many malt
ed milks, and that they were soft
from luxurious living.
We beg to differ. True, Stanford
■was outplayed in the Rose Bowl
and deserved to lose. And yet the
Indians could have easily won.
Stanford was ahead, 7 to G, and
driving for another touchdown. If
the Indians could have had a 14 to
(5 lead, it's doubtful that Illinois
would have chalked up the two

touchdowns necessary to win. What
happened is history. Five years
from now, no one will remember
that an intercepted pass turned the
tide of what could have been a

Card victory. They'll just remem
ber the score.
But now to get to the meat and
substance of what we are trying to
point out . . . that is, trying to
put the '51 team in its proper peg.
No, it was not a great squad, but
it was outstanding. And we say

this for these reason":
1. Stanford won the PCC in a
year when (according to the ex
perts) there were more good
teams than ever before. The
league was packed with talent
from top to bottom.
2. Chuck Taylor, God bless his
red thatch, was selected "Coach of
the Year." To receive an award like
that, you have to have better than
a mediocre team.
3. Possibly most important is the
fact that player for player there are
two or three teams in the PCC
which are better than Stanford.
That means that the Indians won on
something more than just undiluted
skill. That something was spirit and
great heart. We talked to Chuck
Taylor the other day and asked him
why the team won the league gon
falon. He said, "We won because
we had a few outstanding players
and great determination and spirit.
Never underestimate spirit." "Guts
ball," as the guys on the team call
it.
4. Stanford won the Southern Cal
game. We wrote immediately after
the luscious Trojan victory that that
game was the climax of the season.
And we should like to repeat for
the benefit of Mr. and Mrs. North
and South America and all the ships
at drydock that there never was and
never will be a game of football that
will ever equal that one.
5. Finally, our team was out
standing for a reason that you don't
find in the program or the weight
charts. Dink Templeton, who has
coached and seen a lot of teams, hit
it on the head when he said, "I can't
remember ever seeing football
players that were as fine and as
clean-cut as these guys are." Never
were truer words ever spoken. Guys
like Dick Horn, Bill McColl, Gary
Kerkorian, Norm Manoogian, John
Steinberg, Ron Cook, Ted Tanner,
Bob Mathias, Skip Crist, and Bob
Meyers are not only great athletes
. . . they're fine people.


OAKY will throw no more . . .

But now to get to the meat and
substance of what we are trying to
point out . . . that is, trying to
put the '51 team in its proper peg.
No, it was not a great squad, but
it was outstanding. And we say

this for these reason":
1. Stanford won the PCC in a
year when (according to the ex
perts) there were more good
teams than ever before. The
league was packed with talent
from top to bottom.
2. Chuck Taylor, God bless his
red thatch, was selected "Coach of
the Year." To receive an award like
that, you have to have better than
a mediocre team.
3. Possibly most important is the
fact that player for player there are
two or three teams in the PCC
which are better than Stanford.
That means that the Indians won on
something more than just undiluted
skill. That something was spirit and
great heart. We talked to Chuck
Taylor the other day and asked him
why the team won the league gon
falon. He said, "We won because
we had a few outstanding players
and great determination and spirit.
Never underestimate spirit." "Guts
ball," as the guys on the team call
it.
4. Stanford won the Southern Cal
game. We wrote immediately after
the luscious Trojan victory that that
game was the climax of the season.
And we should like to repeat for
the benefit of Mr. and Mrs. North
and South America and all the ships
at drydock that there never was and
never will be a game of football that
will ever equal that one.
5. Finally, our team was out
standing for a reason that you don't
find in the program or the weight
charts. Dink Templeton, who has
coached and seen a lot of teams, hit
it on the head when he said, "I can't
remember ever seeing football
players that were as fine and as
clean-cut as these guys are." Never
were truer words ever spoken. Guys
like Dick Horn, Bill McColl, Gary
Kerkorian, Norm Manoogian, John
Steinberg, Ron Cook, Ted Tanner,
Bob Mathias, Skip Crist, and Bob
Meyers are not only great athletes
. . . they're fine people.


OAKY will throw no more . . .
By now the last sweat - stained
football jersey and battered helmet
has been stored away and some of
the biterness of the Rose Bowl de
feat has faded.
(And as the Old Boy says)
"NOW THAT" we are able to look
at the football season with a rea
sonable degree of detachment, we
would like to do one final piece on
the 1951 Stanford team and try to
put it in its proper peg.
Our PCC championship squad
was not a great team as great teams
go. We thought at one time that it
was. But you can't lose to Cal by
13 points and get mutilated on the
scoreboard by Illinois and still be a
great team.
After the Pasadena afTair, some
•said Stanford never had it in the
first place. Dick Ilyland men
tioned something about the Stan
ford team having tun many malt
ed milks, and that they were soft
from luxurious living.
We beg to differ. True, Stanford
■was outplayed in the Rose Bowl
and deserved to lose. And yet the
Indians could have easily won.
Stanford was ahead, 7 to G, and
driving for another touchdown. If
the Indians could have had a 14 to
(5 lead, it's doubtful that Illinois
would have chalked up the two

touchdowns necessary to win. What
happened is history. Five years
from now, no one will remember
that an intercepted pass turned the
tide of what could have been a

Card victory. They'll just remem
ber the score.
