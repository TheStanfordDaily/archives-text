Five Stanford players were se- j
lected by the professional football
clubs in their annual player draft.,
The drafting of 360 college gridiron
athletes was one of several impor
tant events on the pro football
scene, which included the moving of
a club's franchise and the hiring of
a new coach.
Bill McColl was selected by the
Chicago Bears, Gary Kcrkorian
went to the Pitiburgh Steelers,
Boh Meyers was chosen by the San
Francisco '49ers, and Dick Horn and
Harry Hugasian both were picked
by the New York Yankee - Dallas
club.
The pro football draft is a method
used by the clubs to select the
players for the following season. A
player may not play for any other
club until sold or released by the
club that selected him. The draft
ing was made by 20 rounds of
choosing, starting with the last
place club and ending with the top
team. The two local teams, the '49-
ers and the Los Angeles Rams, sur
prised others by making some rath
er unusual selections.
Though Horn and Hugasian were
actually chosen by the \anks, own
er Ted Collins yesterday sold his
franchise and assets to the National
Football League for $100,000. The
league is in the process of selling it
to Giles Miller, a wealthy Dallas
manufacturer, and Gordon McLen
don, president of the Dallas Liberty
Broadcasting System. The two plan
to house the new team in the Cot
ton Bowl, which seats 75,000.
Before the last - place Yankees
started the regular selecting, the
clubs gave a "bonus pick" to the
club winning a drawing. That team
gets its choice of any player in the
nation.
This year the bonus pick was won
by Los Angeles. Instead of picking
any of the All - Americans, they
made a very unusual selection —
quarterback Billy Wade from Van
derbilt. Not only was the selection
strange from the point that they al
ready have two fine quarterbacks in
Bob Waterfield and Norm Van
Brocklin, but Wade will not even
be available to them for at least
two years, due to Navy duty.
After this bonus selction, the
Yankees started off the regular
drafting by choosing Les Richter
from Cal. Then Green Bay se
lected Vito (Babe) Parclli from
Kentucky. The Chicago Cards,

rprescnted by (heir new coach,
ex - USF mentor Joe Kuhavich,
next surprised practically no one
by choosing Ollie Mat son. Kuha
lich has on several occasions dc-

clared that Matson was the finest
player in the nation as well as
the best player 'he has ever
coached.
After Washington had chosen
Larry Isbell of Baylor, the Chicago
Bears, Jim Dooley of Miami; the
Philadelphia Eagles, Johnny Bright
of Drake; and the Pittsburgh Steel
ers, Ed Modzelewski of Maryland,
the '49ers' turn came. Their first
choice was Hugh McElhenny from
Washington. Though the choice was
not surprising, their announcement
afterward was. They said they in
tend to switch the big fullback to
an end position, where his speed and
ability to fake will be an advantage.
McColl was chosen on the third
round by the Bears. The big AII-
Amcrican has announced that he
will not play pro football unless
he is able to finish medical school
in the The Bears will
advise him to go to the fine Uni
versity of Chicago Med School
when not playing for them. The
'4!)ers might have chosen McColl
and suggested that he finish at
Stanford, but they chose McLl
henny instead.
On the fourteenth round Meyers
was chosen, followed by Horn in the
fifteenth, with Kerkorian and llu
gasian both being picked on the
nineteenth. Other Coast stars that

were chosen included Don Robinson
and Kalph Kreuger of Cal, by the
'4'Jers; Pat Cannamela of USC, by
New York, along with Richter; USC
Hash Frank Clifford, Washington ace
Don Hcinrich, and Charlie Harris
and Hob Karpe of Cal, who went
to tiie New York Giant;; and Dick
Lemmon from Cal, who goes to
Philadelphia.
The other newsworthy event in
nro football last week was the hir
ing of Red Strader by the '49ers.
Strader, who coached the now-de
funct Yanks, will be third assistant
coach unccr Duck Shaw, and will
mainly be scouting other clubs.
McElhcnny, when told of being
drafted by S.F., was overjoyed. He
said that he had hoped one of the
Coast teams would draft him.
"Frankly, I didn't care whether Los
Angeles or the '4f)ers drafted me,
but I was sure hoping that one of
them would pick me up," he said.
The advantage of choosing McEl
henny over some other players is
that he is exempt from military
service, having been married almost
two years before the Korean war.
Ho is one of the few players that
have a good chance of playing next
year.

ton Bowl, which seats 75,000.
Before the last - place Yankees
started the regular selecting, the
clubs gave a "bonus pick" to the
club winning a drawing. That team
gets its choice of any player in the
nation.
This year the bonus pick was won
by Los Angeles. Instead of picking
any of the All - Americans, they
made a very unusual selection —
quarterback Billy Wade from Van
derbilt. Not only was the selection
strange from the point that they al
ready have two fine quarterbacks in
Bob Waterfield and Norm Van
Brocklin, but Wade will not even
be available to them for at least
two years, due to Navy duty.
After this bonus selction, the
Yankees started off the regular
drafting by choosing Les Richter
from Cal. Then Green Bay se
lected Vito (Babe) Parclli from
Kentucky. The Chicago Cards,

rprescnted by (heir new coach,
ex - USF mentor Joe Kuhavich,
next surprised practically no one
by choosing Ollie Mat son. Kuha
lich has on several occasions dc-

clared that Matson was the finest
player in the nation as well as
the best player 'he has ever
coached.
After Washington had chosen
Larry Isbell of Baylor, the Chicago
Bears, Jim Dooley of Miami; the
Philadelphia Eagles, Johnny Bright
of Drake; and the Pittsburgh Steel
ers, Ed Modzelewski of Maryland,
the '49ers' turn came. Their first
choice was Hugh McElhenny from
Washington. Though the choice was
not surprising, their announcement
afterward was. They said they in
tend to switch the big fullback to
an end position, where his speed and
ability to fake will be an advantage.
McColl was chosen on the third
round by the Bears. The big AII-
Amcrican has announced that he
will not play pro football unless
he is able to finish medical school
in the The Bears will
advise him to go to the fine Uni
versity of Chicago Med School
when not playing for them. The
'4!)ers might have chosen McColl
and suggested that he finish at
Stanford, but they chose McLl
henny instead.
On the fourteenth round Meyers
was chosen, followed by Horn in the
fifteenth, with Kerkorian and llu
gasian both being picked on the
nineteenth. Other Coast stars that

were chosen included Don Robinson
and Kalph Kreuger of Cal, by the
'4'Jers; Pat Cannamela of USC, by
New York, along with Richter; USC
Hash Frank Clifford, Washington ace
Don Hcinrich, and Charlie Harris
and Hob Karpe of Cal, who went
to tiie New York Giant;; and Dick
Lemmon from Cal, who goes to
Philadelphia.
The other newsworthy event in
nro football last week was the hir
ing of Red Strader by the '49ers.
Strader, who coached the now-de
funct Yanks, will be third assistant
coach unccr Duck Shaw, and will
mainly be scouting other clubs.
McElhcnny, when told of being
drafted by S.F., was overjoyed. He
said that he had hoped one of the
Coast teams would draft him.
"Frankly, I didn't care whether Los
Angeles or the '4f)ers drafted me,
but I was sure hoping that one of
them would pick me up," he said.
The advantage of choosing McEl
henny over some other players is
that he is exempt from military
service, having been married almost
two years before the Korean war.
Ho is one of the few players that
have a good chance of playing next
year.

The drafting of 360 college gridiron
athletes was one of several impor
tant events on the pro football
scene, which included the moving of
a club's franchise and the hiring of
a new coach.
Bill McColl was selected by the
Chicago Bears, Gary Kcrkorian
went to the Pitiburgh Steelers,

ing was made by 20 rounds of
choosing, starting with the last
place club and ending with the top
team. The two local teams, the '49-
ers and the Los Angeles Rams, sur
prised others by making some rath
er unusual selections.

Washington. Though the choice was
not surprising, their announcement
afterward was. They said they in
tend to switch the big fullback to
an end position, where his speed and
ability to fake will be an advantage.
McColl was chosen on the third
round by the Bears. The big AII-
Amcrican has announced that he
will not play pro football unless
he is able to finish medical school
in the The Bears will
advise him to go to the fine Uni
versity of Chicago Med School
when not playing for them. The
'4!)ers might have chosen McColl
and suggested that he finish at
Stanford, but they chose McLl
henny instead.
On the fourteenth round Meyers
was chosen, followed by Horn in the
fifteenth, with Kerkorian and llu
gasian both being picked on the
nineteenth. Other Coast stars that

were chosen included Don Robinson
and Kalph Kreuger of Cal, by the
'4'Jers; Pat Cannamela of USC, by
New York, along with Richter; USC
Hash Frank Clifford, Washington ace
Don Hcinrich, and Charlie Harris
and Hob Karpe of Cal, who went
to tiie New York Giant;; and Dick
Lemmon from Cal, who goes to
Philadelphia.
The other newsworthy event in
nro football last week was the hir
ing of Red Strader by the '49ers.
Strader, who coached the now-de
funct Yanks, will be third assistant
coach unccr Duck Shaw, and will
mainly be scouting other clubs.
McElhcnny, when told of being
drafted by S.F., was overjoyed. He
said that he had hoped one of the
Coast teams would draft him.
"Frankly, I didn't care whether Los
Angeles or the '4f)ers drafted me,
but I was sure hoping that one of
them would pick me up," he said.
The advantage of choosing McEl
henny over some other players is
that he is exempt from military
service, having been married almost
two years before the Korean war.
Ho is one of the few players that
have a good chance of playing next
year.

Five Stanford players were se- j
lected by the professional football
clubs in their annual player draft.,
The drafting of 360 college gridiron
athletes was one of several impor
tant events on the pro football
scene, which included the moving of
a club's franchise and the hiring of
a new coach.
Bill McColl was selected by the
Chicago Bears, Gary Kcrkorian
went to the Pitiburgh Steelers,
Boh Meyers was chosen by the San
Francisco '49ers, and Dick Horn and
Harry Hugasian both were picked
by the New York Yankee - Dallas
club.
The pro football draft is a method
used by the clubs to select the
players for the following season. A
player may not play for any other
club until sold or released by the
club that selected him. The draft
ing was made by 20 rounds of
choosing, starting with the last
place club and ending with the top
team. The two local teams, the '49-
ers and the Los Angeles Rams, sur
prised others by making some rath
er unusual selections.
Though Horn and Hugasian were
actually chosen by the \anks, own
er Ted Collins yesterday sold his
franchise and assets to the National
Football League for $100,000. The
league is in the process of selling it
to Giles Miller, a wealthy Dallas
manufacturer, and Gordon McLen
don, president of the Dallas Liberty
Broadcasting System. The two plan
to house the new team in the Cot
ton Bowl, which seats 75,000.
Before the last - place Yankees
started the regular selecting, the
clubs gave a "bonus pick" to the
club winning a drawing. That team
gets its choice of any player in the
nation.
This year the bonus pick was won
by Los Angeles. Instead of picking
any of the All - Americans, they
made a very unusual selection —
quarterback Billy Wade from Van
derbilt. Not only was the selection
strange from the point that they al
ready have two fine quarterbacks in
Bob Waterfield and Norm Van
Brocklin, but Wade will not even
be available to them for at least
two years, due to Navy duty.
After this bonus selction, the
Yankees started off the regular
drafting by choosing Les Richter
from Cal. Then Green Bay se
lected Vito (Babe) Parclli from
Kentucky. The Chicago Cards,

rprescnted by (heir new coach,
ex - USF mentor Joe Kuhavich,
next surprised practically no one
by choosing Ollie Mat son. Kuha
lich has on several occasions dc-

clared that Matson was the finest
player in the nation as well as
the best player 'he has ever
coached.
After Washington had chosen
Larry Isbell of Baylor, the Chicago
Bears, Jim Dooley of Miami; the
Philadelphia Eagles, Johnny Bright
of Drake; and the Pittsburgh Steel
ers, Ed Modzelewski of Maryland,
the '49ers' turn came. Their first
choice was Hugh McElhenny from
Washington. Though the choice was
not surprising, their announcement
afterward was. They said they in
tend to switch the big fullback to
an end position, where his speed and
