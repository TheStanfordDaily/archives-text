WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 â€”Presi-
dent Truman asked Congress today
to help thousands of poor but "ca
pable" high school graduates go to
college by providing $30,000,000 a
year in federal scholarships and
loans.
Dr. Earl J. McGrath, commission
er of education, said written "apti
tude tests" would determine who
gets the payments and a "means
test" would determine how much.
The maximum payment would be
$800 a year. The youth could choose
his own college.
"There would be no federal con
trol," McGrath said, adding that the
money would be parceled out to
states under a formula.
