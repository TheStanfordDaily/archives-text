# Budget Cut, Maybe
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Congressional
Republican leaders charged today
that President Truman had "gone
wild" in submitting an $80,400,000,-
000 spending budget and some in
fluential Democrats joined them in
demanding cuts of $7,000,000,000 or
more.
There also was general agreement
that military, as well as non-de
fense spending will have to he
trimmed if any sizeable reduction is
to be made in the President's re
quests.
