# Greek Contralto Praised For Artistic Performance
## 
### RONALD ROSEN 
Singing before an enthralled
audience in Memorial Auditori- j
um last night, Elena Nikolaidi, !
the famous Greek contralto, per- j
formed a widely varied program
which could be hailed as an ar-:
tistic triumph.
After finishing her first selection,
the long and exciting aria "Divini
tes du Styx" from "Alceste" by
Gluck, one was immediately aware
that an exceptional musician was
on the stage. This aria revealed a
voice of rare beauty and power
which was capable of handling the
most difficult passages with the ut
most ease and refinement.
Turning to a group of Schubert
songs, Miss Nikolaidi displayed an
affinity for German lieder which is j
second to none. The peaceful !
"Nacht und Traume" was beauti
fully controlled, as was the buoyant
and saucy "Fischerweisc."
If she had concluded this group i
with the moving "In Abcndroth," j
Miss Nikolaidi would have left
the audience with ample evidence
of her artistry in this field of song;
but instead she gave such a dra
matically moving performance of
I "Der Erlkonig" that everyone wis
left fairly gasping with astonish
! ment.
In an example of classical Italian
! opera, Miss Nikolaidi tos:;ed off with
| ease the vocal pyrotechnics of the
j aria "Bel raggio lusinghier" from
j "Semiramide." She was completely
I at home in the difficult crescendos
i which are so much a part of this
j music. As an encore, (he Metro
| politan Opera star sang the spritely
! "Die Forelle" by Schubert.
After the intermission, Miss Niko
laidi turned to the seldom - heard
"Songs of a Wayfarer" by Mahler.
'If one high peak of artistry could
Ibe singled out, this reviewer's
i choice would be these beautiful
| songs.
The famous Slrrpwalking Scene
j from "Macbeth" by Verdi re
ceived the full Nikolaidi treat
ment which was, in every respect
1 last night, close to perfection.
Miss Nikolaidi was ably accom
panied by John Behr, whose sensi
tive playing was well adapted to
whatever she chose to sing. In re
sponse to the prolonged applause,
I she .sang the "Habanera" from
j "Carmen," the "Piece en forme du
â€¢ Habanera" by Ravel, and the "Lul
laby' by Brahms.
