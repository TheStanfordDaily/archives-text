# Culture Talks Start at Libe
## 
### 
A new cultural feature will be in
troduced to Stanford life tomorrow
when the University library pre
sents the first feature in its "Inter
mezzo" program at 3:30 p.m.
The speaker will be Richard
Scowcroft of the University Crea
tive Writing Center faculty. A nov
elist and associate professor of Eng
lish, he will speak on "Readers and
the Book."
The program is open to students
and faculty members alike. It will
be held in the library's Bender
Room.
Feb. 13 at the same hour and
place, Intermezzo will feature Karl
M. Birkmeyer of the Art Depart
ment faculty in a talk on "Dada
ism, Surrealism, and So On." On
March 5 Dr. William L. Crosten,
head of the University's Music De
partment, will talk on "Then There
Is Music."
Purpose of the new program, as
outlined in the library's announce
ment, is to present a series of talks
"that, perhaps, will make Stanford
people drop their books for a while,
forget their required reading for an
hour or so, just listen to some good
talking about books, music, art;
maybe ask some questions."
