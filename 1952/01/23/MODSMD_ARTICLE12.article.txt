# Ramaswami Cites Indian Leadership
## 
### 
India in the past fifty ycdrs
has been lucky to have leaders
of extraordinarily great stature,
the Hon. Sir Ramaswami, noted
Indian statesman and lecturer,
told the Tuesday Evening Scries
audience last night in Memorial
Auditorium.
However, he emphasized, "fn India,
as in most countries, what matters in
essence is not the man as much as
the idea which from time to time
seizes hold of the mind and imagina
tion of the people."
To prove his point Sir Ramas
wami outlined the manner in which
India has progressed along politi
cal, social, and cultural paths.
When he was in school at tUe turn
of the century, he said, education was
unbelievably lopsided. The English
forced Anglo-Saxon culture, which
they considered "the quintessence of
human wisdom" upon Indians. Sir
Ramaswami himself learned to speak
first English, then French, and then
Sanskrit; he was not taught his na
tive tongue until he was 25.
Although thoroughly grounded in
Greek, Roman and English history,
he never was allowed to study the
history of India. After a careful
study made at that time Macau lay
reported that Indian philosophy
and classics were either obscene
or absurd.
The first of the great Indian lead
ers of this century was Swanii Vive
kananda, who taught Indians to be
proud of their heritage, and to stop
being second-rate imitations of
Europeans.
The movement toward Indiani
zation of culture and education was
hindered by the British at every
point, said Sir Kamaswami. The
same men who in the \'lo's said
that, "The Indian people are un
educated and illiterate; how can
you hope for self-government?" in
1310 vetoed an education act at
tempting to initiate universal edu
cation in the primary grades.
Other important leaders of Mod
ern India whom Sir Ramaswami cited
are Gokahle, the first Indian legis
lator, who fought for Indianization
of industry, the civil service, and the
military, and Dr. Annie Besant, who
took the struggle for liberty to the
people. Sir Ramaswami gave I)r.
Besant credit for starting upheaval
of mass consciousness which Gandhi
later utilized.
Of Gandhi, Sir Kamaswami, a
close friend of the great prophet,
said, "His non-violence was more
mighty than the violence of armies.
He is the one person who delivered
India from the bloody revolutions
experienced by other countries.
Concluding with an estimate of
Nehru, Dr. Ramaswami said "So long
as lie abides in the spirit and foot
steps of Gandhi, all will be well with
India."
