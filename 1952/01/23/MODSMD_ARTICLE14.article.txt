# Law Student Defends Self

### 
A third-year hiw .student, Charles
E. Cole, conducted his own defense
during a jury trial yesterday after
being cited for speeding on Stan
ford 'Avenue Nov. 21.
Cole did not deny having driven
at 38 miles per hour in a 25-mile
zone, but he asserted that the cita
tion was illegal because the arrest
ing officer was driving a police cat
not painted black and while, such
as is provided by state law for
traffic control.
The prosecution, headed by Mar
garet Morton, Santa Clara County
deputy district attorney, contended
that the regulations concerning
black-and-white traffic vehicles ap
ply primarily to state-operated cars.
City Judge Richard E. Doyle Jr.,
presiding, took the point under sub
mission and will report his decision
Jan. 29.
