# ASUC Is To Censor Daily Cal
## 
### 
The Daily Californian, the University of California's student
paper, which is smack in the middle ol a censorship squabble on
the Berkeley campus, may know Friday whether or not its edi
torial policy will be subject to outside supervision.
Censorship now threatens the paper through pressure from the

♦ ASUC Executive Committee. A
proposal by the Cal Excom that
someone be engaged to "advise and
counsel" the paper on a day-by-day
basis will bo considered by the
Board of Regents at their monthly
meeting Friday.
Daily Cal Editor Alva Senzek
told The Daily yesterday (hat she
will meet with California Presi
dent Robert Gordon Sproul today
and will present an alternative
plan. Sproul will report on the
situation to the board Friday.
Trouble began for the Daily Cal
last semester when the paper
printed two articles which described
the East Berlin Youth Rally held
during the summer. The articles
were clearly signed by non - staff
members in what Miss Senzek de
scribed as "a sort of extended letter
to the editor." Miss Senzek ad
mitted they "were pretty hot," but
defended their use.
John Francis Neylan, Regent
member most active in the recent
loyalty oath tight, read the articles
last December and displayed them
at a board meeting. The Regents
asked Sproul to investigate and
make a report.
Dr. Sproul contacted Miss Sen
zek, and the two worked out a plan
calling for a board of experienced
• journalists to act as advisers when
help was needed. This idea is es
sentially what. Miss Senzek will
show Sproul today.
At this point Cal's Excom step
ped in with a more drastic pro
posal. They asked for not only a
board of advisers hut a day-by
day supervisor to chcck what was
printed.
Miss Senzek said yesterday that
some bad feeling existed between
the Excom and the newspaper,
'mostly petty jealousies and little
spats." She claimed the Excom saw
the paper in trouble and moved in
with their own more drastic plan.
Staff members of the Daily Cbl
resent the supervisor plan, which
they call censorship. The staff's
1 alternative plan calls for a jour
nalism professor, an alumni mem
ber, and en administration man,
all experienced in newspaper
work, to act as a hoard and give
advice when it is needed.
I Miss Senzek said the staff should
know after Friday's meeting wheth
| er or not the paper would be able
' to continue its free editorial policy.
The Daily Cal is not being pub
lished now hecause of end-semes
-1 tcr exams. The first paper next se
' mester will be Feb. 11, under the
direction of new editor Mike Fallon.
