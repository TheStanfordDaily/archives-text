# Epic Drama Is New Offering
## 
### 
The Stanford Players, directed by
Nancy Langston, will present their
first play of 1952, '"I he flood Woman
of Setznan," Jan. .'lO through Feb 2
in the Little Theater.
The play, a non-realistic produc
; t.ion, is the first of the epic theater
!to be presented on campus. Epic
theater is distinguished because of
its broad scope of events, scenery,
and locale. Scenery, lighting, and
backstage equipment are exposed to
the audience for the effect of re
minding them that they aie in the
theater.
Instead of appealing to the eyes
of the audience, the epic play appeals
to the imagination, and one small
significant prop is often used rather
than a complete stage-setting. Ac
cording to Hugo Melchiore. stage
manager, this use is due to the in
fluence of the Chinese theater.
"The Good Woman of Setzuan" is
j a satire on Western society which
i prevents people from living up to the
| traditional values. Each minoi char
acter embodies one characteristic
which the a.ithor satirizes. Ihe op
portunity for satirization is set with
three gods coming to earth to look
for one good human being.
The six ballads presented in the
play are by Ynez Lynch and Hazelle
Wilson of the Music Department un
der the direction of Leonard Hatner.
Tickets for the play may be ob
l lined at the Memorial box office for
50 cents each.
