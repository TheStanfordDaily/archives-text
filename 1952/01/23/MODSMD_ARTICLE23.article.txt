# Eating Club Spirit Skyrockets to New High
## 
### HADLEY ROFF 
Though faced with a "troubled
financial situation" and a lack of
housing accommodations, mem
bers of Stanford's seven eating
clubs say that club spirit has sky
rocketed to a new high as club
men settle down to erase diffi
culties that have handcuffed ac
tivities for several years.
Admitting that, the club activities
quag mi red after the calm pre-
World War II day., eating club
bers state that the opening of the
new eating clubs and an increased
membership have welded the clubs
into a determined campus group
since the opening of Stanford last |
fall.
