## 
### 
Pushing foi Stanford's seven eating club3 is still going strong,
according to Interclub President A 1 Sieroty. Informal rushing,
including invitations to lunch and dinner, beer busts, and a Hock
of parties, will continue for the next two weeks.
Because they have not completed their rushing, the eating clubs,

as a group, are not. ready to publish
the lists of their new members. Siei -
oty amplified this by saying that al
though several of the clubs were
ready to release lists, lnterciub
Council decided on an "all or none"
policy and for this reason has pobt
poned the publication of the lists.
Ho added that at the present
time the average, number of new
members per club is about ten.
'I he eating clubs plan to continue
their rushing activities for at least
another two weeks by whicii tini' -
they hope to have pledged enough
new members to bring the clubs
up to maximum strength.
The rushing program liar; been
quite successful with several hun
dred freshmen flocking through the
new headquarters during the two bit;
open houses. The individual clubs
have guested capacity groups at all
their meals the last two weeks.
Sieroty again pointed out the in
formal nature of eating club mem
bership, "We offer thÂ«* social in
timacy of a closely knit group,
while allowing more individuality
for each of the members."
There is no formal pledge pro
cedure connected with eating club
membership. a man has *o do
to join is to indicate his acceptance
if a bid is offered him by the club.
