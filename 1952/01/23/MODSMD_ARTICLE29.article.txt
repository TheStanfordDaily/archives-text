# Daily Cal Faces the Censor
## 
### 
Latest in the list of college newspapers to
feel the threat of censorship is the Daily Cali
fornian, University of California student news
paper. The attack on the Daily Cal by the stu
dent executive committee seems unjustified
and silly. Consider the facts:
The Daily Cal printed two articles about the
East Berlin Youth Festival this summer. Both
articles were admittedly far left and "pretty
hot," according to Daily Cal editor Alva Sen
zek.

But both articles were by nonstaff members,
both articles were clearly signed, and both were
published in a portion of the Daily Cal's edi
torial page set aside for non-staffer's contribu
tions. There could hardly be any confusion to
justify readers thinking the articles showed
Daily Cal editorial policy.
This was reckoning without John Francis
Neyland, member of Cal's Board of Regents
who led the fight for a UC loyalty oath. Ac
cording to reports, Neyland read the articles,
was disturbed and displayed them at a board
meeting. The Board asked President Robert
Gordon Sproul to investigate.
He did so, and a compromise plan calling for
a board of advisers was agreed upon between
Sproul and the Daily Cat staff. But Cal's stu
dent Excom saw a chance to get in the act and
asked for a more drastic plan of supervision
which amounts to one thing—censorship.
Now if the Daily Cal was an irresponsible
propoganda sheet there might be some excuse
for the fuss. But it is not. We have read many
-copies of the paper this yeai and certainly if
the paper is a Communist organ the fact is well
disguised.
The more likely explanation for the censor
ship plan comes from Mis 3 Senzek, who ac
cused the Cal excom of stepping into the act
when they saw that the paper was already in
some difficulty because of the Neyland inci
dent.
Miss Senzck says there are petty jealousies
' between excom and the paper; that the excom
members have sometimes blocked Daily Cal
. staff appointments. This she attributes to the
fact that her paper has upon occasion criti
cized the student government.
Her explanation sounds logical to us. Cer
tainly it will be a sorry day for campus journal
ism when papers are no longer free to criticize
student government, administration, or the
world in general. We wish every bit of good
luck to the Daily Cal in their fight against
strangulation by censorship.
The Daily Cal's troubles bring into focus the
increasing pressure which college newspapers
are now working under. A look a the Pacific

Coast's college papers gives you the idea. The
Daly Trojan is a journalism class project, and
is under direct supervision of the department.
The Same holds true lor Washington, which
even so found it necessary to fire its editor last
spring. The charge: riot adeguate news cover
age because of too much emphasis upon left
wing stories!
At UCLA last spring the student committee
blocked every appointment made by the regu
lar that a completely new organization,
was necessary. And now comes the Daily Cal,
a newspaper which like The Stanford Daily
has long been free from outside pressure, thus
free to comment on student and administra
tion affairs.
This might be a good time to look at The Stan
ford Daily's position in regard to censorship,
news supression, and outside restrictions.
The Daily is independent o/ the journalism
department, it is the ofticial publication ol
the Associated Students ot Stanfoid. As such,
it is naturally tesponsible to the associated
students, whose top body is Excom.
The Daily is free to criticize student govern
ment and administration where it sees fit. Stu
dent government recognizes this, as does the
present administration.
On the other hand, The Daily is responsible,
as we see it, to Stanford. We have an obliga
tion to print the news of the campus and this
we attempt to do in the fairest possible manner.
We realize we're a "monopoly situation" paper,
and we try to print both sides of all issues.
In return for this coverage we reserve the
right to criticize. It's as simple as that. A re
sponsible newspaper working with responsible
students and administrators need not worry
about censorship.
Under our plan of staff appointments, and
elections, there need be little fear of a com
munist clique taking over. Besides, a com
munist wouldn't have time to run the Daily,
study, and be a good communist!
It is our leeling that with freedom of expres
sion comes responsibility. We hope we have
succeeded in keeping with The Daily tradition
of responsibility.
All this doesn't mean we haven't had some
unpleasant experiences. A student official
wants a story killed, a faculty member suggests
"just leave out this little item."
We print the items il we feel they are legiti
mate news. Or perhaps we ask for suggestions
not orders—from the Director of Information
or the journalism department. At any rate, we
do what we feel a responsible campus news
paper should do. We hope the Daily Cal can
continue to do the same, and avoid a dictated
"responsibility." - Daily Editorial Board

Coast's college papers gives you the idea. The
Daly Trojan is a journalism class project, and
is under direct supervision of the department.
The Same holds true lor Washington, which
even so found it necessary to fire its editor last
spring. The charge: riot adeguate news cover
age because of too much emphasis upon left
wing stories!
At UCLA last spring the student committee
blocked every appointment made by the regu
lar that a completely new organization,
was necessary. And now comes the Daily Cal,
a newspaper which like The Stanford Daily
has long been free from outside pressure, thus
free to comment on student and administra
tion affairs.
This might be a good time to look at The Stan
ford Daily's position in regard to censorship,
news supression, and outside restrictions.
The Daily is independent o/ the journalism
department, it is the ofticial publication ol
the Associated Students ot Stanfoid. As such,
it is naturally tesponsible to the associated
students, whose top body is Excom.
The Daily is free to criticize student govern
ment and administration where it sees fit. Stu
dent government recognizes this, as does the
present administration.
On the other hand, The Daily is responsible,
as we see it, to Stanford. We have an obliga
tion to print the news of the campus and this
we attempt to do in the fairest possible manner.
We realize we're a "monopoly situation" paper,
and we try to print both sides of all issues.
In return for this coverage we reserve the
right to criticize. It's as simple as that. A re
sponsible newspaper working with responsible
students and administrators need not worry
about censorship.
Under our plan of staff appointments, and
elections, there need be little fear of a com
munist clique taking over. Besides, a com
munist wouldn't have time to run the Daily,
study, and be a good communist!
It is our leeling that with freedom of expres
sion comes responsibility. We hope we have
succeeded in keeping with The Daily tradition
of responsibility.
All this doesn't mean we haven't had some
unpleasant experiences. A student official
wants a story killed, a faculty member suggests
"just leave out this little item."
We print the items il we feel they are legiti
mate news. Or perhaps we ask for suggestions
not orders—from the Director of Information
or the journalism department. At any rate, we
do what we feel a responsible campus news
paper should do. We hope the Daily Cal can
continue to do the same, and avoid a dictated
"responsibility." - Daily Editorial Board
Latest in the list of college newspapers to
feel the threat of censorship is the Daily Cali
fornian, University of California student news
paper. The attack on the Daily Cal by the stu
dent executive committee seems unjustified
and silly. Consider the facts:
The Daily Cal printed two articles about the
East Berlin Youth Festival this summer. Both
articles were admittedly far left and "pretty
hot," according to Daily Cal editor Alva Sen
zek.

But both articles were by nonstaff members,
both articles were clearly signed, and both were
published in a portion of the Daily Cal's edi
torial page set aside for non-staffer's contribu
tions. There could hardly be any confusion to
justify readers thinking the articles showed
Daily Cal editorial policy.
This was reckoning without John Francis
Neyland, member of Cal's Board of Regents
who led the fight for a UC loyalty oath. Ac
cording to reports, Neyland read the articles,
was disturbed and displayed them at a board
meeting. The Board asked President Robert
Gordon Sproul to investigate.
He did so, and a compromise plan calling for
a board of advisers was agreed upon between
Sproul and the Daily Cat staff. But Cal's stu
dent Excom saw a chance to get in the act and
asked for a more drastic plan of supervision
which amounts to one thing—censorship.
Now if the Daily Cal was an irresponsible
propoganda sheet there might be some excuse
for the fuss. But it is not. We have read many
-copies of the paper this yeai and certainly if
the paper is a Communist organ the fact is well
disguised.
The more likely explanation for the censor
ship plan comes from Mis 3 Senzek, who ac
cused the Cal excom of stepping into the act
when they saw that the paper was already in
some difficulty because of the Neyland inci
dent.
Miss Senzck says there are petty jealousies
' between excom and the paper; that the excom
members have sometimes blocked Daily Cal
. staff appointments. This she attributes to the
fact that her paper has upon occasion criti
cized the student government.
Her explanation sounds logical to us. Cer
tainly it will be a sorry day for campus journal
ism when papers are no longer free to criticize
student government, administration, or the
world in general. We wish every bit of good
luck to the Daily Cal in their fight against
strangulation by censorship.

continue to do the same, and avoid a dictated
"responsibility." - Daily Editorial Board
Latest in the list of college newspapers to
feel the threat of censorship is the Daily Cali
fornian, University of California student news
paper. The attack on the Daily Cal by the stu
dent executive committee seems unjustified
and silly. Consider the facts:
The Daily Cal printed two articles about the
East Berlin Youth Festival this summer. Both
articles were admittedly far left and "pretty
hot," according to Daily Cal editor Alva Sen
zek.

But both articles were by nonstaff members,
both articles were clearly signed, and both were
published in a portion of the Daily Cal's edi
torial page set aside for non-staffer's contribu
tions. There could hardly be any confusion to
justify readers thinking the articles showed
Daily Cal editorial policy.
This was reckoning without John Francis
Neyland, member of Cal's Board of Regents
who led the fight for a UC loyalty oath. Ac
cording to reports, Neyland read the articles,
was disturbed and displayed them at a board
meeting. The Board asked President Robert
Gordon Sproul to investigate.
He did so, and a compromise plan calling for
a board of advisers was agreed upon between
Sproul and the Daily Cat staff. But Cal's stu
dent Excom saw a chance to get in the act and
asked for a more drastic plan of supervision
which amounts to one thing—censorship.
Now if the Daily Cal was an irresponsible
propoganda sheet there might be some excuse
for the fuss. But it is not. We have read many
-copies of the paper this yeai and certainly if
the paper is a Communist organ the fact is well
disguised.
The more likely explanation for the censor
ship plan comes from Mis 3 Senzek, who ac
cused the Cal excom of stepping into the act
when they saw that the paper was already in
some difficulty because of the Neyland inci
dent.
Miss Senzck says there are petty jealousies
' between excom and the paper; that the excom
members have sometimes blocked Daily Cal
. staff appointments. This she attributes to the
fact that her paper has upon occasion criti
cized the student government.
Her explanation sounds logical to us. Cer
tainly it will be a sorry day for campus journal
ism when papers are no longer free to criticize
student government, administration, or the
world in general. We wish every bit of good
luck to the Daily Cal in their fight against
strangulation by censorship.
The Daily Cal's troubles bring into focus the
increasing pressure which college newspapers
are now working under. A look a the Pacific

Coast's college papers gives you the idea. The
Daly Trojan is a journalism class project, and
is under direct supervision of the department.
The Same holds true lor Washington, which
even so found it necessary to fire its editor last
spring. The charge: riot adeguate news cover
age because of too much emphasis upon left
wing stories!
At UCLA last spring the student committee
blocked every appointment made by the regu
lar that a completely new organization,
was necessary. And now comes the Daily Cal,
a newspaper which like The Stanford Daily
has long been free from outside pressure, thus
free to comment on student and administra
tion affairs.
This might be a good time to look at The Stan
ford Daily's position in regard to censorship,
news supression, and outside restrictions.
The Daily is independent o/ the journalism
department, it is the ofticial publication ol
the Associated Students ot Stanfoid. As such,
it is naturally tesponsible to the associated
students, whose top body is Excom.
The Daily is free to criticize student govern
ment and administration where it sees fit. Stu
dent government recognizes this, as does the
present administration.
On the other hand, The Daily is responsible,
as we see it, to Stanford. We have an obliga
tion to print the news of the campus and this
we attempt to do in the fairest possible manner.
We realize we're a "monopoly situation" paper,
and we try to print both sides of all issues.
In return for this coverage we reserve the
right to criticize. It's as simple as that. A re
sponsible newspaper working with responsible
students and administrators need not worry
about censorship.
Under our plan of staff appointments, and
elections, there need be little fear of a com
munist clique taking over. Besides, a com
munist wouldn't have time to run the Daily,
study, and be a good communist!
It is our leeling that with freedom of expres
sion comes responsibility. We hope we have
succeeded in keeping with The Daily tradition
of responsibility.
All this doesn't mean we haven't had some
unpleasant experiences. A student official
wants a story killed, a faculty member suggests
"just leave out this little item."
We print the items il we feel they are legiti
mate news. Or perhaps we ask for suggestions
not orders—from the Director of Information
or the journalism department. At any rate, we
do what we feel a responsible campus news
paper should do. We hope the Daily Cal can
continue to do the same, and avoid a dictated
"responsibility." - Daily Editorial Board
