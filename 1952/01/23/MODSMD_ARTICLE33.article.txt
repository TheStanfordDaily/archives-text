# Photography, New Actor Lift Rather Conventional Decision'
## 
### DICK TREDELL 
"Decision Before Dawn," currently at the Stanford, might have
been a great picture; and with Anatole Litvak, who gave us ""The
Snake Pit," at the helm, we might reasonably have expected great
ness. But George Howe's book, from which the movie was
adapted, was named "Call ft Treason"; and the substitution of the

new, rather routine title hints in iL H
sell' of the film s dilution into mo t
of the conventional elements of
cloak-and-dagger fare.
Two tilings, however, lift "Deci
sion" to a level of unusual interest.

One is the bril
liantly meticu
lous recreation
and photography
of Germany in
1945. The other
is the perfoirn
anc? and per on
of a young actor
new to Ameri-

can audiences. His name: O kar
Werner.
Ihe plot is relatively negligible.
An American lieutenant (Rirh.-ird
Basehart) and two German PW's,
who have agreed to help him,
parachute behind the lines to con
tact a Nazi general who is ready
to surrender. There are more than
the usual number of thrills and
chills as the men work toward
their objective, and things on that
score, if not startlingly original,
are satisfactory enough.
What is original is the look the
picture gives us at the motives for
treason. What causes the PW's to
help the Allies? Are they merely
opportunists who want to be on the
right side when the cards are in?
Or do they have a sense of moral
duty which supersedes the concept
of "My country, right or wrong"?
It is largely Oskar Werner, as one
of the PW's, who convinces us of the
latter motive, for it is on these
grounds that the screen play itself
misses greatness. Instead of really
grappling with its subject, it fails to
bring forth any clear-cut conclu
sion whatsoever.
But Werner builds up a strik
ingly sympathetic characteriza
tion. With five days to live, he
commands our admiration so en
tirely that his sincerity cannot he
doubted. Kven when the screen
play sinks to implausibility, his
sensitive and intelligent manner
manages to impart absolute real

ity to every sequence he is in.
'(lie only disappointment is that
he is never given a reallv big
scene in A'bich lit bring down the
theater, for be could do it.
Tiie "sets," too, are a triumph.
Not sound stages, but the actual,
gho tly ruins of Munich, Nurem
burg, and Mannheim provide a
n inf 111'" re''l backdroo for the ac
tion. Like Werner, they keep the
,wthri..- events plausible.

To anyone who hasn't yet seen
John Steinbeck's "Lifeboat," we
recommend a quick trip to the Car
dinal Theater. Made during the war
by Allied Hitchcock, this suspense
film should please even those who
think Tallulah is a bad little girl
and won't play along with her.
