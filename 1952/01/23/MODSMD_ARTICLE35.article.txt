STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA
• plans ahead to serve you better

Ever since mid-summer of 1950,
military activity in Korea hus calU-d for
heavy transpacific air traffic by civil tun cargo
planes. Over one of. their routes they fly a
round trip of 13,450 miles—some twenty-six
times the length of the famous uirlift into
Berlin. Hundreds of companies help sup
ply this operation. Maybe you'd like to
know what it takes from an oil company to
run an uirlift.
Standard's part in the Pacific airlift
shows that it's a big help to have largo
companies on hand when the going gets
rough. Our work is focused mainly at Wake
Island, that pinpoint some 4000 miles from
the U. S. West Coast. After World War 11,
Wake was a refueling stop for conunen ial
airliners en route to the Orient. But then
came the struggle at the 38th parallel-



To secure the special loading
equipment needed by the ground
crews, a Standard ship picked up the
nearest available —at far-off Canton
Island. And at IJ. S. request, we
helped build new storage facilities
along Wake's runways. ' *


To keep Wake and the airlift dj
supplied on a regular basis,
Standard drew once more on its
tanker fleet. We now operate a
shuttle service to Wake from the
Pacific Coast. Again, being big
and havingourown facilities helps
us Serve.

A 8 air activity
stepped up even more,
Wake needed larger
ground crews. Again,
Standard's bigness
helped.Using facilities
in Honolulu, we quickly
trained men, tripled
our Wake manpower.

course, the transpacific airlift starts
in America, and at home on this end of the
route Standard keeps some 10 airlines sup
plied with aviation gasoline. It would take a
stack of drums a mile high to hold our in
creased daily output for this use. At the same
time, we're also supplying military net-da..«
and our usual volume for motorists.


Before trouble kindled in
Korea, only 20 planes a week re
fueled ut Wake. Then that num
ber multiplied many times. We'd
been supplying gas to the island;
when the U.S. a«ked us to step
up deliveries, we were able to do
it. As a big, integrated company,
we t ailed on our own tanker fleet.
