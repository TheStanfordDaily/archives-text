## Indians Are on the Rebound 
### BY "DIGGER" ODELL 
PERTINENT QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Wha hoppen to the Stanford
basketball team?
I'KE-SEASON COMMENTS: This year Stanford is loaded. They've
!;<»f (lit- longest bench they've had in years. They have innumerable high
scorers. They've got more speed than any one in the Southern Division
"iid will nrohahly run everyone to death. They may lack a little in height,
hill the Indians will make up for it in speed.
POST-MORTEM TO DATE: At the beginning of the season the Cards
wore loaded. They had at .least ten good men or "comers." They still have
many high scorers (Witness the Southern Division scoring race this week;
the four highest scorers are Indians).
The C uds possibly do have more speed than anyone else in the Southern
Divi ion. But, that's as far as we can go.
Alter last weekend's tragedy in Los Angeles, students around the
Farrn begun wondering about all those pretty statements offered last
December. A( that, the old apology started cropping up.
"Stanford is .strictly a December team," a few old hands would say with
knowing looks. "They have a habit of folding in the first round of the
Conference race."
The trouble was that these people were hanging on the pre-season com
ment' without realizing what has taken place on the Card cage team since
then.
Don') get the idea thai we're going to try to apologize for Stanford's
being on the bottom rung of the ladder. We're not. Indian headman Bob
tin melt, whom we talked with for some time Monday, was far from
apologizing when he said that he is proud of his hoys. He wasn't kidding
either, lor it appears that he alone realizes the problems the Indians have
had to face.
Furthermore, the Division race isn't as lopsided as it might seem. At
the top is Cal with a four win, two loss record. The Bears played five out
ol those six games at home, a very definite advantage. The Cards, on the
other hand, are on the bottom with a two, four record, but they played
five of their six games away from home.
Now consider the next round. Cal plays five of her remaining six games
n vay and we stay home fo£ five of our six. Here we have a very definite
advantage.
ll' Stanford had won last Friday night (the regular game ended in a
t:e and the overtime period killed them), the Cards would have entered
the second round with a three, three record, which would have meant
a better than average chance at the title, especially with five of their
* is games at home. A two win, four loss tag makes things a little tougher.
Depending on who beats whom in the next round—and from the way
things look at the moment, it's still wide open—a seven, five record will
pntille a team to at least a playoff. That means we can lose only one more
game, and the Indians realize this. It's possible.
NOW FOR A LOOK AT STANFORD'S PROBLEMS: It's true that we
do have good scorers and a lot of speed, but our long bench has shortened
considerably with the loss of Don Carlson (ineligible) and Paul Johnson
(illness), and because a few members of the squad who Burnett had counted
on have failed to improve.
Another thing, the height and weight situation has become a real
problem, one which Burnett is having difficulty remedying because of
the lack of improvement among some.
Am it now stands, the Cards have only six foot, five inch Jim Ramstead
to rely on for rebounds. Moving Jim Walsh to forward may alleviate the
• it nation on the opponent's boards, but right now it's all up to the Rammer.
Consider how the IDO pounder feels battling men his height or taller and
weighing upwards to 220 (Cal's 6' 7' Bob McKeen, for instance) for 40
minutes two nights in a row. Takes a lot out of a man.
Also consider this situation: Ramstead has the ball in the key. He's
being guarded very closely, and he's all set to take a hook shot. The
Rammer is a good boy with a hook, but he thinks, "If I miss. I'm on de
fense." There's just no one to take the rebound. Gets kind of discouraging.
And it's not because the boys are not working hard. They're in there play
ing their hearts out, but they're bucking a lot of height and a lot of weight.
This has also slowed down tTie Cards' fast break. When the opposition
controls the backboards, it's difficult to work a fast break.
These are just a few problems that Burnett has to face and try to work
out until the second round which starts here on February 15 with UCLA.
He lias five non-conference games in which to try various combinations
in hopes of finding new reserve strength. If anyone can do it, Burnett is
the boy.
Slick with them, men. The Cards may be down, but they're far from
out.
