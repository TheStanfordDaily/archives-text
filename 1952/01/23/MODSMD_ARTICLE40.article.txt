SET-SHOT ARTISTâ€”Big George Walker will be one of many
ex-college flashes cavorting Saturday night in the Pavilion with
the Stewart Chevrolet crew. George played for Cal's great out
fits of 1946 and '47. He can generally be counted on for about
20 long shots a game, with anywhere from none to ten going in.
