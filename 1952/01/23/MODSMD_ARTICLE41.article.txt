## 
### DON WEBSTER 
Scoring 15 points in the first seven
minutes of play, the Theta Delt ll's
coasted to an easy victory last night,
defeating the Psych Grads, 42-20,
in the Encina Gym. It was the first
game of the season for both teams.
The winners were led by foot
ball players Chuck Ilokanson and
Bob Latham. Ilokanson scored 12
points in the first half, and,
though not tallying again, led the
scoring for both teams.
As the game opened, the Delts
scored five quick buckets and led,

10-3. A free throw and two field
goals by Hokanson gave the win
ners a comfortable lead with the
game hardly under way.
Runners-up in the scoring were
Latham and Wally Breuner, each
tallying eight points for the Theta
Delts. Every player on the winning
team scored at least three points,
but no Psych Grad tallied over four.
Sharing the high scoring honors for

I the losers were Laverne Johnson,
Jerry Schartzbaum, and Don Faust.
The game was rough and fea
tured many fouls. The Theta
Delts were handicapped by spotty
shooting of free throws, making
only two out of eight. The grads
sank five out of nine.
In other mural games, the Stern
111 squad squeezed out a 32-31 vic
tory over Brown's Bombers. Herb
Osborn led the winners, scoring 15
points. Claus Shelling was high
scorer for the Bombers, with 12
points.
Gordon McKibbcn scored six
for the winners and tallied the
winning bucket. "Bones" was also
very good under the boards.
