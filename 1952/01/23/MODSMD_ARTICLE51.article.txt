## 
### 
Inflammable sweaters of the
type that seriously burned an
Oakland man last week are mak
ing an appearance in the Palo
Alto-Stanford area, fire depart
ment officials report.
Stanford Fire Chief John Marston

sweaters that ' flash up like explod
ing gasoline when exposed to flame"
was turned over to campus fire
lighters by a student Friday.
In Palo Alio, Fire Marshal Rich
ard Nelson said that one of the
"hot" sweaters was confiscated by
his department last week.
Nelson also told of a Palo Alto
high school hoy who narrowly

escaped serious injr.'y recently
when the sweater he was wearing
burst into flame. Painful burns
were avoided by the youth's
quick - acting companions who
swatted out the flames, Nelson
said.
Others throughout the state have
not been as fortunate as the boy, a
State Fire Marshal's report reveals.
Several persons in the Los Angeles
area were badly burned when their
sweaters ignited.
A number of th<; combustible
sweaters have turned up in Red
wood City lately, leading some in
vestigators to believe (hat a "red
hot" sweater - sales camnaign is
being waged along the Peninsula.
Described as "harmless look
ing," the sweaters are indistinguish
able from the ordinary knit gar
ments except upon careful exami
nation, firemen say.
Pointing out that "flame flashes
over the fabric" easily, Stat" Fire
Marshal Joe Yockers, in a bulle
tin to all California fire chiefs,
said that a spark from a cigarette
is sufficient to kindle one of the
death - filtered sweaters.
Made of a highly flammable knit
fabric, the sweaters will burn into
ash within 45 seconds, the State
Marshal's report declared.

Willi sale of the sweaters illegal
in California, distribution of the
garments is made on the slv by
sale men peddling from cars and
panel trucks. Authorities are con
vinced that none of the inflam
mable sweaters are being sold by
established business firms.
Sold under the brand names of
Esquire, Clysdale, Camel, Kenmore.
Cameo, Bershire, and Flosmore, the
sweaters are peddled in a two-piece
combination of slip-on and coat
sweater. Price for the sets varies,
depending chiefly on what the cus
tomer will pay .
Fire officials warned possible
"hot" sweater owners that fireproof
ing of the garments is impossible.
There is no safety check on the
sweaters other than destruction,
firemen advised.
