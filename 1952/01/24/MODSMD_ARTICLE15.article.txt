# Hall Proposes Reg Book Distribution at Registrar’s
## 
### 
Excom members expressed disapproval of a
proposed change in the distribution of registra
tion books brought up for discussion by Regis
trar Harvey Hall at their meeting last night.
The proposal was to take the distribution of reg
books out of Memorial Auditorium and have

them distributed from the Regis
trar's office.
The Registrar pointed out the two
advantages that would result from
the change—a reduction in costs for
the University by not having to
move the books from the Registrar's
office to Mem Aud, and the security
of having all the books remain in
the office.
But after discussing the incon
veniences for the majority of stu
dents that would result from this
plan, both Excom and Dr. Hall
agreed that the disadvantages far
outweighed the advantages.
The constitution of the Baha'i
Club, a religious organization, was
presented by Dwight Allen and
Amin Banani for Excom's approval
and was tabled.
Allen explained the principles of
the Baha'i faith, which he said ap
plied directly to current world
problems. Among the principles
were the establishment of universal
peace, the spiritual approach to eco
nomic injustices, and the recogni
tion of all monotheistic religions as
one.
