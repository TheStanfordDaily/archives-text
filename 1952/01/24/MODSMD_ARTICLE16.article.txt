# Generous Boy's Eyes Unwanted
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 23 (UP) â€”
The deathbed gesture of a 11-year
old boy proved in vain today when
no takers could be found for the
eyes he willed to the blind.
The Stanford Eye Bank and the
University of California Hospital
sent out calls to medical sources as
far north as Spokane, Wash., and
south to Los Angeles, but no blind
patient willing or able to undergo a
corneal transplant could he found.
Young Edward Branscomb, Sac
ramento, died at Stanford Hospital
shortly after midnight yesterday of
spinal injuries suffered last Septem
ber in a swimming accident. Weeks
before his death he had tried to
give his eyes to the blind, finally
agreeing to .will them at death upon
the advice of his physician.
However, no one needing the eyes
could be found within the 48 hours'
time limit in which the corneas
must be transplanted after the do
nor's death.
But Stanford Eye Bank officials
said Branscomb's eyes would not be
wasted. They will be used in the
conduct of valuable research seek
ing to improve transplant opera
tions.
