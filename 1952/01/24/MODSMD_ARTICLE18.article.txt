# Russia Blamed For Deadlock

### 
TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 21 (UP)
—A broadcast from General Ridg
way's headquarters in Korea today
charged that the responsibility for
the deadlock in the truce talks lies
in Moscow.
Ridgway's "Voice of the United
Nations Command' radio said Rus
sia had "temporarily frozen" the
truce talks for a re-evaluation of
the world situation, and added, "It
is clear that the real decisions are
being made where all the impor
tant Communist decisions are made
—in the Kremlin."
From the truce tents, the word
was still the same—"no progress."
Allied negotiators gave the Reds a
chance to break the stalemate over
airfield construction with a simple
verbal pledge. The Reds refused.
The other big stumbling block, the
prisoner exchange issue, remained
unmoved. No constructive sugges
tions were offered by either side.
The highlights of the day's talks
were:
1. Maj. Gen. Howard M. Turner,
fresh from Tokyo, frankly invited
the Reds to say orally that they
would not build up their military
airfield capabilities during an ar
mistice, and thus resolve one of the
two deadlocks in the talks. They
refused.
2. Rear Adm. R. E. Libby said,
"Nothing transpired of the least im
portance or interest" in the prisoner
exchange committee, and"I don't
know whether we are coming up to
a complete stalemate. It looks like
it."
3. The Reds did promise to hand
over to the Allies today a map
showing the location of their pris
oner camps, and to mark the camps
to forestall any recurrence of the
Kangdong camp bombing in which
they said 20 Allied captives were
killed.
