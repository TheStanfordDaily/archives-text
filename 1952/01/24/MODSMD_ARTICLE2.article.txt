### 
TUNIS, Tunisia, Jan. 23 (UP) â€”At least 27 persons were killed and
two French police were kidnaped today when mobs of Arab na
tionalists battled besieged garrisons in the old fortress town of
Moknine and in neighboring Teboula.
The incidents were the worst of the fast-spreading week-old dis-

orders led by the militant Tunisian
"New Independence" party.
Twenty persons were killed in a
two - hour pitched battle between
5,000 Arabs and French forces at
Moknine, 90 miles south of Tunis.
Seven Deaths in Teboula
At least seven deaths were re
ported from nearby Teboula, where
police rushed in to rescue a sur
rounded French military column.
The Arab Nationalists were re
ported to be in complete control of
Teboula. An authorized French
source said French troops were be
ing moved into the Teboula area
and that military operations against
the Nationalists were expected to
start tomorrow morning.
A police lieutenant was killed by
Arabs in another clash today at
Menzel Ron Zelfa, 50 miles north
east of Tunis. Arab casualties in
the second incident were not known
here.
Screaming Hordes Attack
At least 17 Arabs were killed at
Moknine when a screaming horde of
white-robed followers of the mili
tant "new Independence" party at
tacked the French garrison and the
part - French, part - Arab police
headquarters.
The police were taken by surprise
by the sudden attack and three
were killed and two were kidnaped
by the mob, which then turned on
tbe small but well-armed French
garrison.
The militiamen, firing from be
hind barricaded windows and doors
with all available weapons, drove
the rioters back with a withering
screen of rifle and machine-gun fire.
Marines Restore Order
Order was restored in the town
when a detachment of Marine re
inforcements was put ashore from
the French cutter Elan. The vessel
was rushed to the scene from the
nearby port of Sousse, where 10
persons, including the French gar
rison commander, were killed in a
bloody clash yesterday.
French sources said 5,000 Arabs
were involved in the Moknine inci
dent. The brief battle was described
as rivaling in fury the wartime en
gagements fought between German
and Allied troops in the nearby
Blean d esert area.
