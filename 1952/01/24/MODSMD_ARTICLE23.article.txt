## Excom Votes to Establish Farm Blood Bank Account 
### 
A proposal by the Student Health Commission
that an ASSU blood account be established lor
Stanford students and their dependents was ap
proved by Excom last night.
The blood account will be set up at the San
Mateo Blood Bank, where a supply of 25 to 30

pints of blood will be held in re
serve for Stanford students.
Students will pay the processing
charge of administering blood,
which is $7.50 per pint, while the
pool will take care of the cost of
the blood itself, $2,2.50 per pint.
The blood account will operate
as a checking account, so that a hos
pital administering blood to a stu
dent will be repaid from the pool in
San Mateo. Under this plan the
blood in reserve at the ASSU ac
count could be transferred any
where in the United States.
Blood from the pool will be re
leased only through the approval of
the director or assistant director of
the Stanford Health Servicc.
The account will be under the
name of the ASSU and Excom will
have jurisdiction over its continu
ance.
Dana Newton, a member of the
Student Health Committee, said
that Dr. George Houck of the Stan
ford Health Service had estimated
that 25 to 30 pints of blood would
be sufficient for a yearly basis, and
that these would be solicited by the
committee.

the reorganization within the IIR:
