# Eating Clubs Not Worried
## 
### 
Some confusion has resulted from a story in
yesterday's Daily concerning financial and
housing problems of the eating clubs. Facts in
the story were accurate. Objections we have
heard come from eating club members who
have complained their problems were exagger
-2 aied.
For the record, Interclub Council President
A 1 Sieroty has this to say: "The financial situ
ation will in no way limit the activities of the
clubs. Any debt problems are minor, and the
clubs will definitely continue their expansion
program."

As for housing, Sieroty and Steve Horn, busi
ness manager, emphasize that clubs will be
able to house a good number of their new mem
bers in Toyon next fall. Many eating club men
live off-campus or in the Village by choice, but
nearly all eat with their clubs.
So the sum-up might be simply "everything's
okay, nobody need worry." Coming from Sie
roty and Horn, two men we trust, we'll buy
that. Or put it this way, as did The Daily yes
terday in the self-same story under question:
"Eating club spirit skyrockets to new high."
