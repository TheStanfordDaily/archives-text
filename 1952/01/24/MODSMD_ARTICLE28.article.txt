# BULL SESSION

### DICK McLEAN 
GRANDMA
As I write this column, it's a little past tv/o o'clock
in the morning. Outside the window everything is
dark, and cool, and quiet. The calm of the night is
broken only by an occasional car speeding by and the
dim beacon atop Hoover Tower and the sound of my
typewriter.

Now I realize that this is an |
unusual hour to be writing but I I
can't sleep. I don't know why but !
I just know. A funny thing hap- |
pened to me tonight and maybe |
that's the reason.
I went down to Dinah's earlier I
in the evening. Tonight marked |
the birthday of a friend and a
weary let down now that rushing
was really over. Why not cele
brate a little? It was going to be
1 11 a _ __x.l_ „ .11 .tl

a long pull to catch up on all the lost study and sleep
time. I'd hit that dusty trail tomorrow. Tonight, I
was going to relax.
Dinah's was really fine. The place wasn't crowded
at all when I walked in. On the left side of the
fireplace sat a group of friends helping Dave ease
over his birthday. I picked up a beer at the bar
(only fifteen cents after 9:30) and ioined the hunch.
It was a happy group and we didn't have to talk or
laugh a lot to have a good time. I guess we were
ali a little tired too. A let of the fellows had dates
and when I got through looking at them, 1 took a
long look around Dinah's Shack.
1 heard a girl chattering to her companion, "I went
plus 18 last quarter. I must have been really lucky.
How did you do?"
"Plus 5," he answered sheepishly. "But I flunked
German.''
I thought about the pile of assignments back on
my desk. "Tomorrow," I said to myself and took a
long swallow of beer.
It was fun sitting in front of the fireplace and just
looking. Over every inch of wall space were the
carvings. What a story they could have told. Who
were all these people? What ever happened to
"J.R. + P.D. JUNE 14, 1940"? What did the initials
mean? I'd never know but it v/as fun to wonder.

There was a lot to see if you looked: the way
that the firelight catches the bubbles in a glass of
beer and chases them all the way to the foamy sur
face (where do the hubbies come from anyway?),
the onion shaped lamps, the soot darkened names
on the ceiling, the taste of popcorn and the way
that the husks stick in your throat, the smell of
beans simmering over a slow (lame, the warmth of
the fire on the out side and the creeping warmth of
the beer on the in, the pictures hung on the walls.
That was when I saw Her. Grandma. Not my
grandmother; probably nobody's grandmother. That's
just what I called her. She hangs on the right side
of the fireplace against the wall. What a face! Her
hair is steel gray; her face oval-long. She wears the
tight lace collar of the 1890's. Her mouth is a straight,
hard horizontal line. Her nose is thin and Irish. But
of the whole face the eyes dominate. They look
straight at you wherever you stand. Gray-blue, they
frown at you. You're only having a quiet drink with
a bunch of friends but She makes you feel like a
courtesan at a Roman orgy. If I had to put a word
on the look in those eyes, it would be "righteous."
Grandpa oil the other side of the fireplace was
a good guy. He sits pleasantly in a big chair with
his little golf hat on his head. He looks content with
the world and himself. He doesn't stare at you.
Grandpa wears his golf hat when he goes to the
golf club but he doesn't play. No, he just sits and
looks out the window. He doesn't care what you do.
But Grandma does. I don't know why anyone
should feel guilty. What's wrong with a little re
laxation before the big push? Tomorrow.
But the rationalization wasn't any good. I had the
feeling that She was eyeing every sip of beer, every
sweep of the second on my watch. If 1 turned my
back, I felt as if I was being stared at. If I tried to
look into the fire, I could see Her out of the corner
of my eye.
So now I'm home. The bartender thought I'd had
a little too much when I mumbled, "Okay, Grandma.
You win,' as I walked out the door. Now the day's
not a total waste. I've finished the Bull Session and
can study tomorrow afternoon instead of racing a
deadline. I feel a little better too. My academic con
science is soothed. I sure hope I can sleep now.

beans simmering over a slow (lame, the warmth of
the fire on the out side and the creeping warmth of
the beer on the in, the pictures hung on the walls.
That was when I saw Her. Grandma. Not my
grandmother; probably nobody's grandmother. That's
just what I called her. She hangs on the right side
of the fireplace against the wall. What a face! Her
hair is steel gray; her face oval-long. She wears the
tight lace collar of the 1890's. Her mouth is a straight,
hard horizontal line. Her nose is thin and Irish. But
of the whole face the eyes dominate. They look
straight at you wherever you stand. Gray-blue, they
frown at you. You're only having a quiet drink with
a bunch of friends but She makes you feel like a
courtesan at a Roman orgy. If I had to put a word
on the look in those eyes, it would be "righteous."
Grandpa oil the other side of the fireplace was
a good guy. He sits pleasantly in a big chair with
his little golf hat on his head. He looks content with
the world and himself. He doesn't stare at you.
Grandpa wears his golf hat when he goes to the
golf club but he doesn't play. No, he just sits and
looks out the window. He doesn't care what you do.
But Grandma does. I don't know why anyone
should feel guilty. What's wrong with a little re
laxation before the big push? Tomorrow.
But the rationalization wasn't any good. I had the
feeling that She was eyeing every sip of beer, every
sweep of the second on my watch. If 1 turned my
back, I felt as if I was being stared at. If I tried to
look into the fire, I could see Her out of the corner
of my eye.
So now I'm home. The bartender thought I'd had
a little too much when I mumbled, "Okay, Grandma.
You win,' as I walked out the door. Now the day's
not a total waste. I've finished the Bull Session and
can study tomorrow afternoon instead of racing a
deadline. I feel a little better too. My academic con
science is soothed. I sure hope I can sleep now.

GRANDMA
As I write this column, it's a little past tv/o o'clock
in the morning. Outside the window everything is
dark, and cool, and quiet. The calm of the night is
broken only by an occasional car speeding by and the
dim beacon atop Hoover Tower and the sound of my
typewriter.

Now I realize that this is an |
unusual hour to be writing but I I
can't sleep. I don't know why but !
I just know. A funny thing hap- |
pened to me tonight and maybe |
that's the reason.
I went down to Dinah's earlier I
in the evening. Tonight marked |
the birthday of a friend and a
weary let down now that rushing
was really over. Why not cele
brate a little? It was going to be
1 11 a _ __x.l_ „ .11 .tl

a long pull to catch up on all the lost study and sleep
time. I'd hit that dusty trail tomorrow. Tonight, I
was going to relax.
Dinah's was really fine. The place wasn't crowded
at all when I walked in. On the left side of the
fireplace sat a group of friends helping Dave ease
over his birthday. I picked up a beer at the bar
(only fifteen cents after 9:30) and ioined the hunch.
It was a happy group and we didn't have to talk or
laugh a lot to have a good time. I guess we were
ali a little tired too. A let of the fellows had dates
and when I got through looking at them, 1 took a
long look around Dinah's Shack.
1 heard a girl chattering to her companion, "I went
plus 18 last quarter. I must have been really lucky.
How did you do?"
"Plus 5," he answered sheepishly. "But I flunked
German.''
I thought about the pile of assignments back on
my desk. "Tomorrow," I said to myself and took a
long swallow of beer.
It was fun sitting in front of the fireplace and just
looking. Over every inch of wall space were the
carvings. What a story they could have told. Who
were all these people? What ever happened to
"J.R. + P.D. JUNE 14, 1940"? What did the initials
mean? I'd never know but it v/as fun to wonder.

There was a lot to see if you looked: the way
that the firelight catches the bubbles in a glass of
beer and chases them all the way to the foamy sur
face (where do the hubbies come from anyway?),
the onion shaped lamps, the soot darkened names
on the ceiling, the taste of popcorn and the way
that the husks stick in your throat, the smell of
beans simmering over a slow (lame, the warmth of
the fire on the out side and the creeping warmth of

pened to me tonight and maybe |
that's the reason.
I went down to Dinah's earlier I
in the evening. Tonight marked |
the birthday of a friend and a
weary let down now that rushing
was really over. Why not cele
brate a little? It was going to be
1 11 a _ __x.l_ „ .11 .tl

a long pull to catch up on all the lost study and sleep
time. I'd hit that dusty trail tomorrow. Tonight, I
was going to relax.
Dinah's was really fine. The place wasn't crowded
at all when I walked in. On the left side of the
fireplace sat a group of friends helping Dave ease
over his birthday. I picked up a beer at the bar
(only fifteen cents after 9:30) and ioined the hunch.
It was a happy group and we didn't have to talk or
laugh a lot to have a good time. I guess we were
ali a little tired too. A let of the fellows had dates
and when I got through looking at them, 1 took a
long look around Dinah's Shack.
1 heard a girl chattering to her companion, "I went
plus 18 last quarter. I must have been really lucky.
How did you do?"
"Plus 5," he answered sheepishly. "But I flunked
German.''
I thought about the pile of assignments back on
my desk. "Tomorrow," I said to myself and took a
long swallow of beer.
It was fun sitting in front of the fireplace and just
looking. Over every inch of wall space were the
carvings. What a story they could have told. Who
were all these people? What ever happened to
"J.R. + P.D. JUNE 14, 1940"? What did the initials
mean? I'd never know but it v/as fun to wonder.

There was a lot to see if you looked: the way
that the firelight catches the bubbles in a glass of
beer and chases them all the way to the foamy sur
face (where do the hubbies come from anyway?),
the onion shaped lamps, the soot darkened names
on the ceiling, the taste of popcorn and the way
that the husks stick in your throat, the smell of
beans simmering over a slow (lame, the warmth of
the fire on the out side and the creeping warmth of
the beer on the in, the pictures hung on the walls.
That was when I saw Her. Grandma. Not my
grandmother; probably nobody's grandmother. That's
just what I called her. She hangs on the right side
of the fireplace against the wall. What a face! Her
hair is steel gray; her face oval-long. She wears the
tight lace collar of the 1890's. Her mouth is a straight,
hard horizontal line. Her nose is thin and Irish. But
of the whole face the eyes dominate. They look
straight at you wherever you stand. Gray-blue, they
frown at you. You're only having a quiet drink with
a bunch of friends but She makes you feel like a
courtesan at a Roman orgy. If I had to put a word
on the look in those eyes, it would be "righteous."
Grandpa oil the other side of the fireplace was
a good guy. He sits pleasantly in a big chair with
his little golf hat on his head. He looks content with
the world and himself. He doesn't stare at you.
Grandpa wears his golf hat when he goes to the
golf club but he doesn't play. No, he just sits and
looks out the window. He doesn't care what you do.
But Grandma does. I don't know why anyone
should feel guilty. What's wrong with a little re
laxation before the big push? Tomorrow.
But the rationalization wasn't any good. I had the
feeling that She was eyeing every sip of beer, every
sweep of the second on my watch. If 1 turned my
back, I felt as if I was being stared at. If I tried to
look into the fire, I could see Her out of the corner
of my eye.
So now I'm home. The bartender thought I'd had
a little too much when I mumbled, "Okay, Grandma.
You win,' as I walked out the door. Now the day's
not a total waste. I've finished the Bull Session and
can study tomorrow afternoon instead of racing a
deadline. I feel a little better too. My academic con
science is soothed. I sure hope I can sleep now.

GRANDMA
As I write this column, it's a little past tv/o o'clock
in the morning. Outside the window everything is
dark, and cool, and quiet. The calm of the night is
broken only by an occasional car speeding by and the
dim beacon atop Hoover Tower and the sound of my
typewriter.
