# PRO AND CAHN

### 
Don't expect Stanford to win its next five basketball games, all of
which are non-conference tilts.
We say this be cause Coach Bob Burnett is going to shake up his squad
in hopes of finding the winning combination and the winning way. Now
we don't really think that Stanford will lose all five of these games, in fact
we doubt if they will lose three of the five. But the point is that we are
not looking for five wins and therefore don't stand a chance of being disap
pointed. We admire Burnett for his courage in attempting to reorganize
with the season half played through.
Bub is not sure just what will come of juggling the team, the offense
and the defense, or just how much juggling he will do, but the fact remains
that there will be no doubt be some changes made by the time the Cards
take to the Conference trail again come Feb. 15.
Before the current campaign got underway the prognosticators, who are
more often wiring than right, pretty much agreed that Stanford would be
right up there when the Southern Division PCC race was over. Presently
the Cards are securely anchored in the basement.
The team started out like a house afire back in December, winning game
after game. They looked good in the Big Seven Tourney although they did
nut win it. And then all collapsed. The Cards opened the PCC by earning
a split with the Bruins at Westwood and everyone was satisfied. Alter all
it was only the third time in as many years that UCLA has lost a game at
home. Then it was a disappointing split with California, a team not sup
posed to have it this year. But last week the Indians folded to USC.
What explanation is there for this? Saving the usual talk of improper
offensive and defensive methods for later, we suggest that perhaps the
Injuns reached their mid-season peak too early, sometime late De
cember and then slacked off. We have seen this happen not only this
year but in several seasons past. A red hot Stanford five does exception
ally well in pre-conference games, and tfien with Conference play under
way, the squad begins to fade.
On the other hand, California, this year and in the past has started slowly
and suddenly blooms into a basketball power just in time to reap the Con
ference harvest.
We hope that Stanford did not reach a peak too early because if so,
the season is over. And all that is left is for Stanford to gain valuable
experience for next year.
Nov/ what about this fast break and full court press defense. It must
be remembered that Stanford is not a tall club. Don Carlson's ineligibility
hurts. It is not easy for a ball club to absorb the loss of a G' 4" first string
forward and .survive as well as Stanford has done. Following Carlson's loss
Burnett was forced to rely on speed because of a definite deficit in height.
(Illie Suzdaleff, Ron Tomsic, and Ed Tucker are small. But they are
also fast, quick and good shooters. And there is your explanation for the
fast break; outrun your opponent and shoot before a defense can he set,
because rebounds are few. That is what Stanford has done in its majority
of wins.
Anil with a lack of height, defensively speaking, the answer is don't let
your opponent shoot, because the chances are good that you are not going
to get the rebound. The best way not to let your opponent shoot is not
to let him have the ball. A full court press, which picks up the dribbler
before he crosses the center stripe has a rattling effect on many players.
It often causes the inexperienced to lose the ball.
Of course such defensive tactics sometimes backfire as in the case
<;f Cal's Jim Doan, and SC's Ken Flower, who eluded their men and
drove the length of the court for set ups or were fouled in their attempts.
This is the risk that must be taken when using the full court press, which
is necessary when playing with the type of personnel such as Stanford
has this year.
In the next three weeks, Burnett will be modifying his team's type of
play and who knows what he will come up with. Perhaps the press and
last break will be discarded as more tall men are shifted into the opening
five. Perhaps things will remain unchanged
We feel that the season is far from over. The Cards do not leave the
Pavilion for any of the six remaining PCC games except for one at Ber
keley. The other teams play mostly on the road. We haven't given vip by
any means on this being Stanford's cage year.
Iktif as we say don't be too shocked if we drop many of (he next
"experinu ntal' ones which include games with the Stewarts, San Jose
Stale, Phillips Oilers, St. Mary's and Santa Clara. After that, look out.
The rest of the season will he a dilly.

pointed. We admire Burnett for his courage in attempting to reorganize
with the season half played through.
Bub is not sure just what will come of juggling the team, the offense
and the defense, or just how much juggling he will do, but the fact remains
that there will be no doubt be some changes made by the time the Cards
take to the Conference trail again come Feb. 15.
Before the current campaign got underway the prognosticators, who are
more often wiring than right, pretty much agreed that Stanford would be
right up there when the Southern Division PCC race was over. Presently
the Cards are securely anchored in the basement.
The team started out like a house afire back in December, winning game
after game. They looked good in the Big Seven Tourney although they did
nut win it. And then all collapsed. The Cards opened the PCC by earning
a split with the Bruins at Westwood and everyone was satisfied. Alter all
it was only the third time in as many years that UCLA has lost a game at
home. Then it was a disappointing split with California, a team not sup
posed to have it this year. But last week the Indians folded to USC.
What explanation is there for this? Saving the usual talk of improper
offensive and defensive methods for later, we suggest that perhaps the
Injuns reached their mid-season peak too early, sometime late De
cember and then slacked off. We have seen this happen not only this
year but in several seasons past. A red hot Stanford five does exception
ally well in pre-conference games, and tfien with Conference play under
way, the squad begins to fade.
On the other hand, California, this year and in the past has started slowly
and suddenly blooms into a basketball power just in time to reap the Con
ference harvest.
We hope that Stanford did not reach a peak too early because if so,
the season is over. And all that is left is for Stanford to gain valuable
experience for next year.
Nov/ what about this fast break and full court press defense. It must
be remembered that Stanford is not a tall club. Don Carlson's ineligibility
hurts. It is not easy for a ball club to absorb the loss of a G' 4" first string
forward and .survive as well as Stanford has done. Following Carlson's loss
Burnett was forced to rely on speed because of a definite deficit in height.
(Illie Suzdaleff, Ron Tomsic, and Ed Tucker are small. But they are
also fast, quick and good shooters. And there is your explanation for the
fast break; outrun your opponent and shoot before a defense can he set,
because rebounds are few. That is what Stanford has done in its majority
of wins.
Anil with a lack of height, defensively speaking, the answer is don't let
your opponent shoot, because the chances are good that you are not going
to get the rebound. The best way not to let your opponent shoot is not
to let him have the ball. A full court press, which picks up the dribbler
before he crosses the center stripe has a rattling effect on many players.
It often causes the inexperienced to lose the ball.
Of course such defensive tactics sometimes backfire as in the case
<;f Cal's Jim Doan, and SC's Ken Flower, who eluded their men and
drove the length of the court for set ups or were fouled in their attempts.
This is the risk that must be taken when using the full court press, which
is necessary when playing with the type of personnel such as Stanford
has this year.
In the next three weeks, Burnett will be modifying his team's type of
play and who knows what he will come up with. Perhaps the press and
last break will be discarded as more tall men are shifted into the opening
five. Perhaps things will remain unchanged
We feel that the season is far from over. The Cards do not leave the
Pavilion for any of the six remaining PCC games except for one at Ber
keley. The other teams play mostly on the road. We haven't given vip by
any means on this being Stanford's cage year.
Iktif as we say don't be too shocked if we drop many of (he next
"experinu ntal' ones which include games with the Stewarts, San Jose
Stale, Phillips Oilers, St. Mary's and Santa Clara. After that, look out.
The rest of the season will he a dilly.
Don't expect Stanford to win its next five basketball games, all of
which are non-conference tilts.
We say this be cause Coach Bob Burnett is going to shake up his squad
in hopes of finding the winning combination and the winning way. Now
we don't really think that Stanford will lose all five of these games, in fact
we doubt if they will lose three of the five. But the point is that we are
not looking for five wins and therefore don't stand a chance of being disap
pointed. We admire Burnett for his courage in attempting to reorganize

Before the current campaign got underway the prognosticators, who are
more often wiring than right, pretty much agreed that Stanford would be
right up there when the Southern Division PCC race was over. Presently
the Cards are securely anchored in the basement.
The team started out like a house afire back in December, winning game
after game. They looked good in the Big Seven Tourney although they did
nut win it. And then all collapsed. The Cards opened the PCC by earning
a split with the Bruins at Westwood and everyone was satisfied. Alter all
it was only the third time in as many years that UCLA has lost a game at
home. Then it was a disappointing split with California, a team not sup
posed to have it this year. But last week the Indians folded to USC.
What explanation is there for this? Saving the usual talk of improper
offensive and defensive methods for later, we suggest that perhaps the
Injuns reached their mid-season peak too early, sometime late De
cember and then slacked off. We have seen this happen not only this
year but in several seasons past. A red hot Stanford five does exception
ally well in pre-conference games, and tfien with Conference play under
way, the squad begins to fade.
On the other hand, California, this year and in the past has started slowly
and suddenly blooms into a basketball power just in time to reap the Con
ference harvest.
We hope that Stanford did not reach a peak too early because if so,
the season is over. And all that is left is for Stanford to gain valuable
experience for next year.
Nov/ what about this fast break and full court press defense. It must
be remembered that Stanford is not a tall club. Don Carlson's ineligibility
hurts. It is not easy for a ball club to absorb the loss of a G' 4" first string
forward and .survive as well as Stanford has done. Following Carlson's loss
Burnett was forced to rely on speed because of a definite deficit in height.
(Illie Suzdaleff, Ron Tomsic, and Ed Tucker are small. But they are
also fast, quick and good shooters. And there is your explanation for the
fast break; outrun your opponent and shoot before a defense can he set,
because rebounds are few. That is what Stanford has done in its majority
of wins.
Anil with a lack of height, defensively speaking, the answer is don't let
your opponent shoot, because the chances are good that you are not going
to get the rebound. The best way not to let your opponent shoot is not
to let him have the ball. A full court press, which picks up the dribbler
before he crosses the center stripe has a rattling effect on many players.
It often causes the inexperienced to lose the ball.
Of course such defensive tactics sometimes backfire as in the case
<;f Cal's Jim Doan, and SC's Ken Flower, who eluded their men and
drove the length of the court for set ups or were fouled in their attempts.
This is the risk that must be taken when using the full court press, which
is necessary when playing with the type of personnel such as Stanford
has this year.
In the next three weeks, Burnett will be modifying his team's type of
play and who knows what he will come up with. Perhaps the press and
last break will be discarded as more tall men are shifted into the opening
five. Perhaps things will remain unchanged
We feel that the season is far from over. The Cards do not leave the
Pavilion for any of the six remaining PCC games except for one at Ber
keley. The other teams play mostly on the road. We haven't given vip by
any means on this being Stanford's cage year.
Iktif as we say don't be too shocked if we drop many of (he next
"experinu ntal' ones which include games with the Stewarts, San Jose
Stale, Phillips Oilers, St. Mary's and Santa Clara. After that, look out.
The rest of the season will he a dilly.
Don't expect Stanford to win its next five basketball games, all of
which are non-conference tilts.
We say this be cause Coach Bob Burnett is going to shake up his squad
in hopes of finding the winning combination and the winning way. Now
we don't really think that Stanford will lose all five of these games, in fact
we doubt if they will lose three of the five. But the point is that we are
not looking for five wins and therefore don't stand a chance of being disap
pointed. We admire Burnett for his courage in attempting to reorganize
with the season half played through.
Bub is not sure just what will come of juggling the team, the offense
and the defense, or just how much juggling he will do, but the fact remains
that there will be no doubt be some changes made by the time the Cards
take to the Conference trail again come Feb. 15.
