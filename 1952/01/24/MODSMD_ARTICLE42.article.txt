# Watch Out, Mathias

ALL-AROUND ACE â€” Robert Richards, the second-best pole
vaulter in history, is also probably the second-best decathlon
man in history. He won the championship last year when Stan
ford's Bob Mathias decided not to defend his crown. The two
will meet head on next year in the decathlon and again in the
Olympics. Richards, of course, picks up most of his points in
the pole vault, in which he constantly hits 15 feet.
