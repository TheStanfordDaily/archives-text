# Ruggers Begin Workouts Today
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
It's v/inter again and rugby, baby brother to football, is again
under way. Practice has begun and although Coach Pete Kmetovic
is optimistic about the team's chances, he can't promise we'll be
able to duplicate the ruggers' performances of the last two seasons.
Two year's ago Stanford's rugby team was the Pacific Coast

champion. Last season the Cardf
tied the California Bears for that
honor.
Graduation has hit the ruggers
hard. Gone is Russ Latham, last
year's brilliant three-quarters back.
Latham, one of the greatest ruggers
in Stanford history, was chosen to
an All-British Empire team when he
played for the University of British
Columbia, one year before he came
to Stanford.
Also tough to replace will be scrum
half Jim Bradshaw, who directed the
ruggers as does a quarterback in
football; Sam Thornton, place-kick
ing specialist; fullback Vance Shef
fey, whose position is comparable to
the football safety man; rugged line
men Jack Bonetti, Btrnie Tokarz.
Dave Anderson, and Dave Stanley;
and backs John Banks and Bill De-
Young.
Manongian, Cone, Kirkland Return
Holdovers from last year's varsity
include Norm Manoogian, Jesse
Cone, and Al Kirkland in the line
and Ron Cook, Harry Snell, and
VVes Laubscher return from last'
year's backfield.
Footballers from this year's squad
that will help bolster the rugby team
are Phil Wilson, Ted Tanner, Sam
Morley, Al Hanner, John Broderick,
Jim Vick, Doug Pinto, Dave Worley,
and Roy Krickeberg.
Kmetovic will be counting heavily
on Bill McMahon, a transfer student
who is also the number-one light
weight for boxing coach Ray Lunny.
McMahon has considerable experi
ence, having played rugby in Canada
before he came to California. He
will play in the backfield.
Mayrhofer Rated Tops
Len Mayrhofer, a transfer was a
first string varsity tackle for the
Gaels in 1950, and has been described
as one of those most responsible for
their surprising showing against
Gerogia that year. St. Mary's tied
Wally Butts' crew, 7-7. Ineligible for
football last season, Mayrhofer is an

outstanding prospect.
Harry Snell, who conies from South
Africa, is a real sleeper. He is

thoroughly familiar with the game
and has speed and power.
Plenty of Weight
The ruggers will have plenty of
heft. Leading the parade are Len
Kaprielian, 255, and Jim Telegan,
236. Both boys played J.V. football
last fall.
Tentative games are listed against
(he Palo Alto Ramblers, the Olympic
Club, Cal, the University of British
Columbia, and UCLA. They play two
games against both Cal and the
Olympic Club.
The Ramblers will be first on the
schedule. The match is slated for
next week.

on Bill McMahon, a transfer student
who is also the number-one light
weight for boxing coach Ray Lunny.
McMahon has considerable experi
ence, having played rugby in Canada
before he came to California. He
will play in the backfield.
Mayrhofer Rated Tops
Len Mayrhofer, a transfer was a
first string varsity tackle for the
Gaels in 1950, and has been described
as one of those most responsible for
their surprising showing against
Gerogia that year. St. Mary's tied
Wally Butts' crew, 7-7. Ineligible for
football last season, Mayrhofer is an

outstanding prospect.
Harry Snell, who conies from South
Africa, is a real sleeper. He is

thoroughly familiar with the game
and has speed and power.
Plenty of Weight
The ruggers will have plenty of
heft. Leading the parade are Len
Kaprielian, 255, and Jim Telegan,
236. Both boys played J.V. football
last fall.
Tentative games are listed against
(he Palo Alto Ramblers, the Olympic
Club, Cal, the University of British
Columbia, and UCLA. They play two
games against both Cal and the
Olympic Club.
The Ramblers will be first on the
schedule. The match is slated for
next week.


PETE KMETOVIC
—Rugby coach
It's v/inter again and rugby, baby brother to football, is again
under way. Practice has begun and although Coach Pete Kmetovic
is optimistic about the team's chances, he can't promise we'll be
able to duplicate the ruggers' performances of the last two seasons.
Two year's ago Stanford's rugby team was the Pacific Coast

champion. Last season the Cardf
tied the California Bears for that
honor.
Graduation has hit the ruggers
hard. Gone is Russ Latham, last
year's brilliant three-quarters back.
Latham, one of the greatest ruggers
in Stanford history, was chosen to
an All-British Empire team when he
played for the University of British
Columbia, one year before he came
to Stanford.
Also tough to replace will be scrum
half Jim Bradshaw, who directed the
ruggers as does a quarterback in
football; Sam Thornton, place-kick
ing specialist; fullback Vance Shef
fey, whose position is comparable to
the football safety man; rugged line
men Jack Bonetti, Btrnie Tokarz.
Dave Anderson, and Dave Stanley;
and backs John Banks and Bill De-
Young.
Manongian, Cone, Kirkland Return
Holdovers from last year's varsity
include Norm Manoogian, Jesse
Cone, and Al Kirkland in the line
and Ron Cook, Harry Snell, and
VVes Laubscher return from last'
year's backfield.
Footballers from this year's squad
that will help bolster the rugby team
are Phil Wilson, Ted Tanner, Sam
Morley, Al Hanner, John Broderick,
Jim Vick, Doug Pinto, Dave Worley,
and Roy Krickeberg.
Kmetovic will be counting heavily
on Bill McMahon, a transfer student
who is also the number-one light
weight for boxing coach Ray Lunny.
McMahon has considerable experi
ence, having played rugby in Canada
before he came to California. He
will play in the backfield.
