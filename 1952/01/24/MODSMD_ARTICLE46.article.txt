## Encina 2W Decisions 1E 
### 
After a slow first half, the Encina
2W cagers exploded to defeat the
Encina IE team, 44 to 14.
At half-time the 2W team was
ahead, 12 to 5, and after two min
utes of the second half the IE ball
club had shortened the lead to three
points.
Then four successive baskets by
Roy Morlidge and Bob Griffith gave
the 2W team a lead that was never
relinquished. Griffith repeatedly
broke away for lay-ins. The 2W
team used race horse tactics contin
ually to break a man in the clear
before the IE team had a chance to
set up their defense.
Bob Griffith was the high scorer
with 16 points, outscoring the entire
IE team. Griffith was supported by
John Cunningham, Mai MacLeod,
and Morlidge who scored eight
points apiece.
Bob Margolis was the high scorer
for the IE team with eight points.
