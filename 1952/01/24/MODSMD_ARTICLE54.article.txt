# Stern Hall Built by Levi Legacy
## 
### JEAN MALTSEFF 
Stanford's modern, flat-rooled
dormitory, Stern Hall, grew out
of'a wish to make others happy
and a group of gold miners
whose pants wore out too
quickly.
Upon the death of her husband,
the wealthy Mrs. Louis Stern de
cided to ui;e her fortune in making
others happy. And three decades
of Stanford men will never forget
"Aunt Lucie."
Aunt Lucie tried to make the stu
dents' struggle for an education a
little more pleasant. Small weekly
dinner parties at her home were at
tended by hundreds of students and
faculty members in the '30's and
'40's. She had the faculty members
on the alert for promising but poor
students she could help. Most of the
students were men, since Aunt Lu
cie felt the girls could take care of
themselves.
According to one of her frequent
guests, Aunt Lucie was a great
hostess. She was always completely
frank in expressing her opinions.
She formed marked likes and dis
likes of guests once they had dined
at her home. Those she disliked
were never invited back.
Aunt Lucie's Gift Closet
Anyone who attended a dinner
party was also invited to Aunt Lu
cie's gift closet, stocked with neck
ties, shirts, sweaters, and countless
articles. Guests were supplied with
two of an article, never one.
At one time Aunt Lucie insisted
on outfitting a famous European

play director who had lectured at
Stanford at her request. He accept
ed her generosity only after being
informed it was the usual procedure
at the Stern home. Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur also received many presents
from the closet .
Aunt Lucie had a Stanford room
in her house containing photo
graphs and mementos of prominent
members of the faculty and student
body. She always asked for pic
tures of persons she liked.
Telgvams for the Boys
Graduates found Aunt Lucie a
valuable link with friends they had
lost track of. And from her home
went many telegrams to all parts of
the world in remembrance of birth
days of Aunt Lucie's boys.
Graduation ceremonies were per
formed for Aunt Lucie in 1941 when
Dr. Wilbur conferred upon her the
degree of Honorary Stanford Fel
low, and the ASSU presented her a

life membership in the student
body.
Among Aunt Lucie's donations to
Stanford were several students' loan
funds, scholarships, the Children's
Free Bed Fund in the Convalescent
Home, a fluoroscopic unit to the
Men's Health Service, and a re
search laboratory for the medical
school.
Palo Alto Buildings
Aunt Lucie also donated money
to build the Civic Theater, nucleus
of the Palo Alto Community Cen
ter, the Children's Theater, the Boy
Scout Circle, and other buildings in
Palo Alto.
She was personally shy and re
tiring, avoiding publicity wherever
possible. Her contribution to the
Civic Theater was first announced
as anonymous.
Aunt Lucie gained her wealth
when she married Louis Stern, one
of the four nephews of Levi Strauss
and successor to the wholesale busi

ness he established by accident.
Levi Strauss Comes West
When Levi Strauss came West to
pan for gold in 1850, he brought
goods with him instead of money.
Prices were high, and although he
sold everything else for 50 per cent
above cost, Strauss couldn't sell the
canvas he had brought for San
Francisco's tent city.
But the canvas solved the prob
lem of miners who were hard on
their trousers. With the aid of a
tailor, Strauss was .in husiness. In
the 1860's another tailor added the
finishing touch to the garment. He
was constantly bothered by the
same miner for repairs on his
ripped - off trouser pockets; One
day the tailor sneaked out, had the
pockets riveted on, and started the
practice followed today by the
makers of levis.
Aunt Lucie died in 194G, but died
having succeeded, with the help of
those miners who wore their pants
out too quickly, in her self-assigned
task of making people happy.


LUCIE'S LEGACY—Three decades of Stanford men knew Mrs. Louis Stern's generosity and her
outstanding contribution to men's on-campus housing has placed her high on the list of well
remembered benefactors. Her donations to the University include Lucie Stern Hall, one of the
most modern campus dormitories, several students' loan funds, scholarships, and a research

party was also invited to Aunt Lu
cie's gift closet, stocked with neck
ties, shirts, sweaters, and countless
articles. Guests were supplied with
two of an article, never one.
At one time Aunt Lucie insisted
on outfitting a famous European

play director who had lectured at
Stanford at her request. He accept
ed her generosity only after being
informed it was the usual procedure
at the Stern home. Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur also received many presents
from the closet .
Aunt Lucie had a Stanford room
in her house containing photo
graphs and mementos of prominent
members of the faculty and student
body. She always asked for pic
tures of persons she liked.
Telgvams for the Boys
Graduates found Aunt Lucie a
valuable link with friends they had
lost track of. And from her home
went many telegrams to all parts of
the world in remembrance of birth
days of Aunt Lucie's boys.
Graduation ceremonies were per
formed for Aunt Lucie in 1941 when
Dr. Wilbur conferred upon her the
degree of Honorary Stanford Fel
low, and the ASSU presented her a

life membership in the student
body.
Among Aunt Lucie's donations to
Stanford were several students' loan
funds, scholarships, the Children's
Free Bed Fund in the Convalescent
Home, a fluoroscopic unit to the
Men's Health Service, and a re
search laboratory for the medical
school.
Palo Alto Buildings
Aunt Lucie also donated money
to build the Civic Theater, nucleus
of the Palo Alto Community Cen
ter, the Children's Theater, the Boy
Scout Circle, and other buildings in
Palo Alto.
She was personally shy and re
tiring, avoiding publicity wherever
possible. Her contribution to the
Civic Theater was first announced
as anonymous.
Aunt Lucie gained her wealth
when she married Louis Stern, one
of the four nephews of Levi Strauss
and successor to the wholesale busi

ness he established by accident.
Levi Strauss Comes West
When Levi Strauss came West to
pan for gold in 1850, he brought
goods with him instead of money.
Prices were high, and although he
sold everything else for 50 per cent
above cost, Strauss couldn't sell the
canvas he had brought for San
Francisco's tent city.
But the canvas solved the prob
lem of miners who were hard on
their trousers. With the aid of a
tailor, Strauss was .in husiness. In
the 1860's another tailor added the
finishing touch to the garment. He
was constantly bothered by the
same miner for repairs on his
ripped - off trouser pockets; One
day the tailor sneaked out, had the
pockets riveted on, and started the
practice followed today by the
makers of levis.
Aunt Lucie died in 194G, but died
having succeeded, with the help of
those miners who wore their pants
out too quickly, in her self-assigned
task of making people happy.


LUCIE'S LEGACY—Three decades of Stanford men knew Mrs. Louis Stern's generosity and her
outstanding contribution to men's on-campus housing has placed her high on the list of well
remembered benefactors. Her donations to the University include Lucie Stern Hall, one of the
most modern campus dormitories, several students' loan funds, scholarships, and a research
lab for the Medical School.
Stanford's modern, flat-rooled
dormitory, Stern Hall, grew out

funds, scholarships, the Children's
Free Bed Fund in the Convalescent
Home, a fluoroscopic unit to the
Men's Health Service, and a re
search laboratory for the medical
school.
Palo Alto Buildings
Aunt Lucie also donated money
to build the Civic Theater, nucleus
of the Palo Alto Community Cen
ter, the Children's Theater, the Boy
Scout Circle, and other buildings in
Palo Alto.
She was personally shy and re
tiring, avoiding publicity wherever
possible. Her contribution to the
Civic Theater was first announced
as anonymous.
Aunt Lucie gained her wealth
when she married Louis Stern, one
of the four nephews of Levi Strauss
and successor to the wholesale busi

ness he established by accident.
Levi Strauss Comes West
When Levi Strauss came West to
pan for gold in 1850, he brought
goods with him instead of money.
Prices were high, and although he
sold everything else for 50 per cent
above cost, Strauss couldn't sell the
canvas he had brought for San
Francisco's tent city.
But the canvas solved the prob
lem of miners who were hard on
their trousers. With the aid of a
tailor, Strauss was .in husiness. In
the 1860's another tailor added the
finishing touch to the garment. He
was constantly bothered by the
same miner for repairs on his
ripped - off trouser pockets; One
day the tailor sneaked out, had the
pockets riveted on, and started the
practice followed today by the
makers of levis.
Aunt Lucie died in 194G, but died
having succeeded, with the help of
those miners who wore their pants
out too quickly, in her self-assigned
task of making people happy.


LUCIE'S LEGACY—Three decades of Stanford men knew Mrs. Louis Stern's generosity and her
outstanding contribution to men's on-campus housing has placed her high on the list of well
remembered benefactors. Her donations to the University include Lucie Stern Hall, one of the
most modern campus dormitories, several students' loan funds, scholarships, and a research
lab for the Medical School.
Stanford's modern, flat-rooled
dormitory, Stern Hall, grew out
of'a wish to make others happy
and a group of gold miners
whose pants wore out too
quickly.
Upon the death of her husband,
the wealthy Mrs. Louis Stern de
cided to ui;e her fortune in making
others happy. And three decades
of Stanford men will never forget
"Aunt Lucie."
Aunt Lucie tried to make the stu
dents' struggle for an education a
little more pleasant. Small weekly
dinner parties at her home were at
tended by hundreds of students and
faculty members in the '30's and
'40's. She had the faculty members
on the alert for promising but poor
students she could help. Most of the
students were men, since Aunt Lu
cie felt the girls could take care of
themselves.
According to one of her frequent
guests, Aunt Lucie was a great
hostess. She was always completely
frank in expressing her opinions.
She formed marked likes and dis
likes of guests once they had dined
at her home. Those she disliked
were never invited back.
Aunt Lucie's Gift Closet
Anyone who attended a dinner
party was also invited to Aunt Lu
cie's gift closet, stocked with neck
ties, shirts, sweaters, and countless
articles. Guests were supplied with
two of an article, never one.
At one time Aunt Lucie insisted
on outfitting a famous European

play director who had lectured at
Stanford at her request. He accept
ed her generosity only after being
informed it was the usual procedure
at the Stern home. Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur also received many presents
from the closet .
Aunt Lucie had a Stanford room
in her house containing photo
graphs and mementos of prominent
members of the faculty and student
body. She always asked for pic
tures of persons she liked.
Telgvams for the Boys
Graduates found Aunt Lucie a
valuable link with friends they had
lost track of. And from her home
went many telegrams to all parts of
the world in remembrance of birth
days of Aunt Lucie's boys.
Graduation ceremonies were per
formed for Aunt Lucie in 1941 when
Dr. Wilbur conferred upon her the
degree of Honorary Stanford Fel
low, and the ASSU presented her a

life membership in the student
body.
Among Aunt Lucie's donations to
Stanford were several students' loan
funds, scholarships, the Children's
Free Bed Fund in the Convalescent
Home, a fluoroscopic unit to the
Men's Health Service, and a re
search laboratory for the medical
school.
