TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 24 (UP)
â€” United Nations tanks attacked
along a seven-mile sector of the
western Korean front yesterday
with a blazing 1,600-shell barrage,
the Eighth Army announced today.
The ground war erupted into the
heaviest fighting since mid-Decem
ber and UN infantrymen in cen
tral Korea fought a heavy six-hour
batt'e with the Chinese, the heavi
est since Dec. 14 when the Allies
attacked Communist - held Paik's
Peak near Kaesong.
American Sabrejet pilots shot
down two Russian-built MIG-15's,
probably destroyed another, and
damaged one yesterday as the air
war resumed after days of interfer
ence by bad weather.
A total of 122 Red jets were
sighted, but only a score of them
closed in for a fight. The rest, ac
cording to pilot reports, played tag
with the Sabres and scurried back
to their Manchurian sanctuary
when the Americans attempted to
get close.
The Allied tanks hit Communist
bunkers at five points along a sev
en - mile sector between Kumsong
and the Pukhan River.
