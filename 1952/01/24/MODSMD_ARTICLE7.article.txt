# Scholastic Deficiencies Increased Last Quarter
## 
### HARRY GLAZE 
Last quarter 288 students ei
ther flunked out or were placed
on probation as compared with
219 in the autumn of 1950. Of
these 288, 36 were permanently
disqualified, 55 were tempora
rily suspended, and 197 were
placed on probation.
This is an increase from 2.84 per
cent to 3.80 per cent of the entire
student body, graduate .students in
cluded. This is not a significant in
crease, though, according to Profes
sor Raymond D. Harriman, chair
man of the Committee on Scholar
ship.
"It is a student's own responsibil
ity to maintain a satisfactory scho
lastic standing here at Stanford.
Failure to realize this and do some
thing about it is the prime cause foi
suspension or disqualification from
the University," comments Dr. Har
riman.
The Committee on Scholarship
reviews the rases of students
whose grades are not satisfactory
and prescribes the proper action.
Serving on the committee are
three members of the administra
tive staff, three faculty members,
and a chairman, who is also cho
sen from the facility. Appoint
ments are made annually by the
president of the University.
There arc three classifications of
deficiency at Stanford. The first is
probation, in which a student's
grade-point average falls anywhere
from —11 to —20 inclusive. Proba
tion is a warning. Students are or
dinarily not permitted to register
on probation for more than two
quarters, whether they are consec
utive or not.
Probation is determined by a
student's cumulative record, as
are suspension and disqualifica
tion. That is, if a student goes
—II his frst quarter and plus
zero the next, he is on probation
for both quarters because he has
failed to make uo his low grades.
Students on probation for more
than two quarters or whose aver
ages are from —21 to —30 inclusive
are suspended for two quarters. At

the end of his suspension the stu
dent may write a letter to the com
mittee stating the cause of his defi
ciency and the way he hopes to
overcome it and be readmitted if
approved.
Upon his return the suspended
student must earn at least a "C"
average his first quarter arid
make up half of his deficiency by
the end of his second quarter. Or
dinarily nobody can he suspended
more than once. About one-half
of all suspended students return
to Stanford.
Disqualification is a permanent
action; once a person has been dis
qualified, he is ordinarily never
eligible for readmittance. If a sus
pended student floes not make up
his deficiency or incurs a total de
ficiency of —31 or more, he is dis
qualified.
Incomplete grades count as fail
ures until made up. If part of a
disqualified student's deficiency is
due to incompletes, he may ap
peal to (he committee again.
However, the committee will not
consider an incomplete received
because a student thinks he can
do better after he has had more
than the allotted time.
In every deficiency case the com
mittee carefully considers the indi
vidual circumstances; thus the rules
are not necessarily applied auto
matically. The Committee on Schol
arship trios to prevent rather than
cure academic deficiencies.
The f'an.Tn point is not proba
tion hut the time when the stu
dent goes —I or —2, according to
Mr. Harriman. This is the real
warning stage. He believes that
the student should solve bis aca
demic problem himself or go 112«»
someone who can help him. Here
?•( Stanford the problem lies even
more with the student than at
most other schools because there
are no special social regulations
for deficient students.
Dr. Harriman points out that most
people wait until it is too late before
trying to iron out difficulties. The
beginning of the quarter, not the
week before finals, is the time to
begin thinkins about good work.

Dr. Harriman points out that most
people wait until it is too late before
trying to iron out difficulties. The
beginning of the quarter, not the
week before finals, is the time to
begin thinkins about good work.
Last quarter 288 students ei
ther flunked out or were placed
on probation as compared with
219 in the autumn of 1950. Of
these 288, 36 were permanently
disqualified, 55 were tempora
rily suspended, and 197 were
placed on probation.
This is an increase from 2.84 per
cent to 3.80 per cent of the entire
student body, graduate .students in
cluded. This is not a significant in
crease, though, according to Profes

man of the Committee on Scholar

"It is a student's own responsibil

Failure to realize this and do some

The Committee on Scholarship
reviews the rases of students
whose grades are not satisfactory
and prescribes the proper action.
Serving on the committee are
three members of the administra

and a chairman, who is also cho

ments are made annually by the
president of the University.
There arc three classifications of
deficiency at Stanford. The first is
probation, in which a student's
grade-point average falls anywhere
from —11 to —20 inclusive. Proba
tion is a warning. Students are or
dinarily not permitted to register
on probation for more than two
quarters, whether they are consec
utive or not.
Probation is determined by a
student's cumulative record, as
are suspension and disqualifica
tion. That is, if a student goes
—II his frst quarter and plus
zero the next, he is on probation
for both quarters because he has
failed to make uo his low grades.
Students on probation for more
than two quarters or whose aver
ages are from —21 to —30 inclusive
are suspended for two quarters. At

the end of his suspension the stu
dent may write a letter to the com
mittee stating the cause of his defi
ciency and the way he hopes to
overcome it and be readmitted if
approved.
Upon his return the suspended
student must earn at least a "C"
average his first quarter arid
make up half of his deficiency by
the end of his second quarter. Or
dinarily nobody can he suspended
more than once. About one-half
of all suspended students return
to Stanford.
Disqualification is a permanent
action; once a person has been dis
qualified, he is ordinarily never
eligible for readmittance. If a sus
pended student floes not make up
his deficiency or incurs a total de
ficiency of —31 or more, he is dis
qualified.
Incomplete grades count as fail
ures until made up. If part of a
disqualified student's deficiency is
due to incompletes, he may ap
peal to (he committee again.
However, the committee will not
consider an incomplete received
because a student thinks he can
do better after he has had more
than the allotted time.
In every deficiency case the com
mittee carefully considers the indi
vidual circumstances; thus the rules
are not necessarily applied auto
matically. The Committee on Schol
arship trios to prevent rather than
cure academic deficiencies.
