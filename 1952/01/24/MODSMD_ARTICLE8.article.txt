# Tax Agency Shakeup Is Prescribed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UP) â€”
House investigators who dug into
the Internal Revenue Bureau scan
dals threw their support to Presi
dent Truman's reorganization plan
in a surprise move today.
The group warned, however, that
the shakeup will not furnish all ,the
"houseeleaning" needed in the tax
collecting agency. Rep. Cecil R.
King (D., Calif.), chairman of the
tax fraud hunters, said it was only
the "first step."
King and Rep. Carl T. Curtis (R.,
Neb.), a member of his House Ways
and Means subcommittee, testified
in favor of the plan before the
House Executive Expenditures
Committee. The committee will
give Mr. Truman's program its first
test tomorrow. Rep. Clare E. Hoff
man (R., Mich.), top Republican
member, said he would not oppose
it.
Much of the opposition that first
developed in the House appeared to
be melting, but Senate hostility
might not soften. Senators have
more to lose in the way of patron
age if the officials become Civil
Service members rather than politi
cal appointees.
The President wants to replace
the nation's 64 Internal Revenue
Collectors with up to 25 district col
lectors, all under Civil Service. Ei
ther house could kill the plan with
an unfavorable vote. Otherwise it
becomes effective automatically on
March 14.
