# Author as Person Dominates Work, Says Scowcroft
## 
### 
"The Personality of the author,
the most dynamic feature, of his
work, may be detected by his atti
tudes toward his characters," de
clared Richard Scowcroft in the
opening talk of the Intermezzo pro
gram presented by the library.
A standing-room only crowd who
climbed the steps to the Bender
Room heard Scowcroft, University
Creative Writing Center faculty
member, explain that the way to get
the most enjoyment out of any
book is to give one's self over com
pletely to the personality of the
author.
To illustrate different personali
ties of authors expressed in their
books, Scowcroft read excerpts
from "Traveler's Samples" by Frank
O'Connor, "The Witchdiggers" by
Jessamyn West, and "Catcher in the
Rye" by J. B. Salinger.
William Ready, acquisition libra
rian, in charge of the Intermezzo
program, introduced novelist Scow
croft to the audience. Coffee was
served after the lecture.
Future lectures will feature Karl
M. Birkmeyer of the Art Depart
ment faculty on Feb. 1.3, and Dr.
William L. Crosten, University Mu
sic Department head, on March 5.
