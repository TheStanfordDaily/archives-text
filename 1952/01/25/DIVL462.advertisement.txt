One Basket
\ collide basketball team once had plenty
>112 nothing. It was so had that even the
coach hadn't gone to a game all season.
Couldn't stand to watch hi* job collapse.
So the team careened through its sched
ule unci iiit the road for the big game,
the season's windup. Due to lose by over
forty-five points, the experts said.
Ilul somebody back on campus bad a
brainstorm and started a notion. Tele
grams. to be exact. Just before game
time, the team got more telegrams than
you could shake a referee at. Croup tele
grams from fraternities and sororities,
personal telegrams from Prcxy and the
Dean of Women hundreds of telegrams,
all saying "We're behind you, team!"
\nd by golly, the boys pulled themselves
together and went out and lost by only
twenty-eight points, instead of forty-five.
The moral is plain. The more you en
courage guys, the better they work or
play. Civing anyone a hand by telegrams
does wonders for gratitude and coopera
tion whether it's cash from Lome you
want or a date or just to send a thought
ful message to someone on any special
occasion. Just call Western linion, or
head for your local Western Union office.
