# Draft Boss Seeks UMT

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP)
—Draft Director Lewis B. Her
shey suggested today that Con
gress let the armed services start
universal military training now
with men deferred from the draft
—students, farmers and others.
He also warned that the army.!
navy and air force "eventually"
might have to lower their mental
and physical standards or draft
fathers and veterans to meet their
manpower needs.
But at the same time, Hershey said
there has been "some indication" in
the past five weeks that the armed
services will not need as many men
as had been anticipated.
He did not elaborate, but may
have referred to President Tru
man's statement that the armed
services manpower coal for July 1,
1953, is 3,700,000 men. Previous
estmates had put it at 4,000,000.
A selective service spokesman said
Hershey's UMT proposal would be
"entirely voluntary." ile said de
ferred registrants would not be
forced to take training but would
he offered "incentives." One of these,
he said, might be the possibility of
a more secure deferment if they
stepped forward.
Hershey testified before the Senate
preparedness committee which is
looking into the manpower situa
tion. He said there are enough men
available to meet military needs
through the March draft call of
30,000 men but that two months of
80,000-man calls would be "pre
carious."
At the same time, Hershey or
dered state draft directors to fill
their February manpower quotas
with men 21 years or age and
older, wherever possible.
The plan is to get all men 21 arid
over inducted as soon as possible and
then draft the 20-year-olds. This
means induction of most 19-year
olds will be halted for the time being.
The order also means that some
draft boards now down to only 19-
year-olds may not call anyone for
induction next month while other
draft boards in the same state with
more older men will have to double
up on their calls to make up the
state quota.
Meantime, rclgious and labor union
leaders aired their objections to uni
versal military training before the
house armed services committee.
The Anti-UMT witnesses included
Jay Warren Kaufman, Drcxel Hill,
Pa., pastor, who appeared in behalf
of the Presbyterian Church, and CIO
and AFL spokesmen.

means induction of most 19-year
olds will be halted for the time being.
The order also means that some
draft boards now down to only 19-
year-olds may not call anyone for
induction next month while other
draft boards in the same state with
more older men will have to double
up on their calls to make up the
state quota.
Meantime, rclgious and labor union
leaders aired their objections to uni
versal military training before the
house armed services committee.
The Anti-UMT witnesses included
Jay Warren Kaufman, Drcxel Hill,
Pa., pastor, who appeared in behalf
of the Presbyterian Church, and CIO
and AFL spokesmen.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP)
—Draft Director Lewis B. Her
shey suggested today that Con
gress let the armed services start
universal military training now
with men deferred from the draft
—students, farmers and others.
He also warned that the army.!
navy and air force "eventually"
might have to lower their mental
and physical standards or draft
fathers and veterans to meet their
manpower needs.
But at the same time, Hershey said
there has been "some indication" in
the past five weeks that the armed
services will not need as many men
as had been anticipated.
He did not elaborate, but may
have referred to President Tru
man's statement that the armed
services manpower coal for July 1,
1953, is 3,700,000 men. Previous
estmates had put it at 4,000,000.
A selective service spokesman said
Hershey's UMT proposal would be
"entirely voluntary." ile said de
ferred registrants would not be
forced to take training but would
he offered "incentives." One of these,
he said, might be the possibility of
a more secure deferment if they
stepped forward.
Hershey testified before the Senate
preparedness committee which is
looking into the manpower situa
tion. He said there are enough men
available to meet military needs
through the March draft call of
30,000 men but that two months of
80,000-man calls would be "pre
carious."
At the same time, Hershey or
dered state draft directors to fill
their February manpower quotas
with men 21 years or age and
older, wherever possible.
The plan is to get all men 21 arid
over inducted as soon as possible and
then draft the 20-year-olds. This
means induction of most 19-year
olds will be halted for the time being.
The order also means that some
