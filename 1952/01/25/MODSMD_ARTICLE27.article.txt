# Canine Conquest Stirs Minor Furor at Encina
## 
### 
A campaign to put caniucs |
back on campus is the current j
projort of a rjroup of first floor
Encina men.
It all started two dayr; ago when
Duke, a five-year-old hlack Do her
mnn, appeared in the first floor cor
ridor apparently very anxious for a
meal. Won over by what Fnvinaites
termed the hound's "irreststable
charms," John Buggee prepared a
hasty meal for Duke out of the re
mans of an Encina Commons dinner.
From then on Dukes conquest was
complete. The dog remained in the
hall for most of one evening before
he was admonished by a sponsor to
never wag his tail on the premises
again.

Duke was taken to the Palo Alto
Dog Found and placed in the over
night shelter by his Kncina bene
factors.
So far protest has been to 110 avail.
Mr. Sutnner has said, "University
rules prohibit the keeping of pets
n campus living groups." Rtigcee
said he would contnue to seek per
mission to adopt an animal as a
mascot for the Frosh at Encina.
"Even if Duke is gone we have hopes
that someday we will be able to ob
tain a suitable mascot which we
think would help unite our class
and build school spirit. We're sure
we'll find one soon and maybe the
University by then will change its
mind."â€”J.F.
