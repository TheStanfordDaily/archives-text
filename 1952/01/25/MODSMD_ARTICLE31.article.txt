# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Things were looking Hack yesterday. The rain was
raining. Homework was piling up. And gentlemen
were still making pot shots at other gentlemen in

Korea.
I strode into The Daily Shack,
finished off the last few bars of
the Funeral March, and sat down
at my typewriter to write a Bull
Session entitled "Why 1 Hate
Everyone."
Then the editor stormed over,
pointed a bony finder in my face,
and shouted, "Okay, Grothe, I
want you to be funny!"
"Huh?"
"You heard me, I said I wanted

you to be funny. No more cliches about "some weather
we're having" or telling everyone how illogical the
logic course is."
"But," I butted, "I don't feel funny. Writing Bull
Session is a strain. Look what's happened to po-»r
Dick McLean. Already three members of the lan
guage department have tried to assassinate him by
poisoning his frijoles. Dick's in such bad shape that
he's seeing grandmothers and grandfathers on the
walls at Dinah's. Too bad. Dick had it in his day."
"No excuses," shouted the editor, throwing a pile
of papers at me. He had just finished scoring six points
in an intra-mural game, and he was feeling pretty
athletic.
"But lookit," I stammered, "I don't feel like writ
ing anything funny. Besides, what's there to write
about? Donald E. Close rolled out «»f school a long
time ago. Marvin (). Adams has quit writing letters
to the editor, and no one has left footprints on Hoo
ver Tower in a long time."
"Furthermore, the professors of logic are after me,
and so is my draft board. If that isn't enough, I'm

still considering the commission of suicide since the
Rose Bowl, and the basketball team hasn't made me
change my mind."
The Daily's chief rooster dabbed a hankie to his eye
and allowed, "Yes, Pete, but the show must go on."
"The show must go on!? The show must go on!?
What is this- Kant's Head or The Daily?" I shouted,
making a funny. "Why must the show go on? Do
you realize that a lew days from nOw, everyone on
campus is going to break out with fur coats? A fine
thing. Me, without a mink or silver fox' to my name.
All 1 have is an Afghanistan sheep fur which I usu
ally lie on when I get under my car to llx it."
"Enough of this," shot back the editor. "I want you
to be funny, see! Funny!! Make the people laugh.
Be so funny thai every eight o'clock class will break
up in a roai of laughter."
"Look, I announced, standing up and knocking
over two cub reporters with a sweep of my arms. "Do
you lealize that tins is the eighth quarter in a row
that my professors have called me Growth instead of
Grotaaaay. And you till want me to be funny. Okay,
1 11 be funny. Did you hear about the two musicians
talking and one musician saying, 'Who was that wo
man I saw you with last night?' And the other one
answering. 'That was no woman, that was my fife.'"
"No, stop," cried the editor.
"Or about the two cannibals talking and qne say
ing 'Wlin was fhat woman I saw you with last night?'
mid the other one answering 'That was no woman,
that was my dinner.'"
"Okay, okay, 1 give up," sobbed the editor. "Don't
be funny. Wiite anything you want. Go ahead! Go
ahead! Ruin the papei See if 1 care! Ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
Poor guy, he's really out of it. Now, let me see,
what was I going to write? Oh, yes, "Why I Hate
Everyone."
