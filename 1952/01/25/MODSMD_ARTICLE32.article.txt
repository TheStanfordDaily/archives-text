## More Competition Needed in Early Games

To the Editor:
When a basketball team ha?, the four leading scorers
in the Southern Division, and yet is on the bottom of
the conference, one is attracted towards finding an
explanation.
A lot of it must be in the early season scheduling
of opponents. Take this year for instance. While Stan
ford was playing St. Mary's, YMI, COP, and USF;
UCLA and SC were playing Illinois, Kentucky, Brad
ley, Oklahoma A & M, Duke and NC State. While
we rolled up an impressive string of victories, UCLA
and SC were fairly soundly trounced by their op
ponents. Yet when the conference play begins—who
wins? Who loses?
For the last four years Stanford has gone into the
conference play with the superior won and lost rec
ord In the conference, but this doesn't seem to have
carried through in conference play.
No oiip can say that our personnel or coaching are
inferior. I say, let's play teams that are better than
we are in preparation for conference play. This will
builcl up especially our defensive strength. Then and

only then will wp clobber conference opponents.
