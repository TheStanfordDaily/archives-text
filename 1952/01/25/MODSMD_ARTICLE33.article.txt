# The 						Daily's Abbreviations
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In reference to my letter of a week or so ago con
cerning abbreviations of the proper names at Stan
ford by your paper, I can see that the seed of sug
gestion fell on barren ground.
However I still want to state that if you use letter
abbreviations in headlines for an article it is good
journalistic practice to state somewhere in the course
of that article what the letters stand for. Ninety
per cent of the readers may already know, but there
is always the "ten per cent."

Clark for his constructive criticism. He points out
basic newspaper rules which The Daily misses upon
occasion. We'll stick to Excom for Executive Com
mittee, however!)
