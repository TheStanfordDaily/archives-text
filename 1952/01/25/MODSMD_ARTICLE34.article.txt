### HOLBROOK TETER 
-TEriitcr's note- The Daily starts
a series of at tit les today by Hol
brook Teter, Daily night editor,
who has just returned from Eu
rope. Teter, with former Stan
ford student Bob Johmon and
Miss Mary Paget <>f Boston, mad?
a 20,000 - mile trip completely
around the Mediterranean Sea
this summer and earlv fall.
Teter and his companions trav
eled in a Renault, a four-cylinder
French car. They started in Ge
neva in late July and drove
•through Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece,
Tu.key, the Near Eastern coun
tries, Egypt, and along the entire
length of the Novth African coast
t<> Tangier where they crossed to
{-pain and finished their journey
Oct. 1.
Teter has written the articles
primarily about the people he
met; the impressions these people
had, what they thought about
America and Russia and the world
in general. His first article is
about Yugoslavia.)

We entered Yugoslavia from
the International Zone of Trieste.
After taking a short drive along
the beautiful Dalmatian coast and
visiting the handsome cities of
Abbazia and Fiume, we went di
rectly to Belgrade. The capital
city of Yugoslavia, with many
fine buildings and broad ave
nues, gave us the impression
that it was living in an unhappy
calm.
The people were not quick or
pmiling, the gaping store windows
were empty. In the main park
music played over loudspeakers to
listless strollers. Tito's picture was
everywhere, like "Big Brother."
People Complain
And people complained — about
the food, about government meas
ures, about tbr full prisons, about
Tito. We were constantly amazed
by the freedom with which various
people we met criticized the gov
ernment. An elderly lady, who cov
ered her windows with newspapers
because she was afraid of spies, told

us about the fear and derpair of the
people. And how the peasants
sometimes have to buy on the open
market to meet the crop quotas
they "owe" the government.
In southern Yugoslavia, as we
stood in a village street, a young
man came up to us and .said, in
good English, "We live in a concen
tration camp here." Elsewhere a
government employee told us wist
fully that "saint; aren't popular
here any more."
U.S. Prestige High
American prestige seem 3d very
high, and people were quite pleased
to know that we were "American
ski." We were told that the Voice
of America was very popular.
One young man in Skoplje raid he
was going to see an American West
ern that evening. He didn't like
Russian films because, he said,
they're too full of propaganda. Hp
had learned to speak English well
from a textbook and the radio.
Several told us that condition?

had improved since Yugoslavia had
gotten on better terms with the
West, and since American aid had
been received.
But, they complained, America
doesn't know what life is like in
Yugoslavia today. They hoped that
the United States would press Tito
to adopt a more liberal, democratic
policy.
In the southern cities of Nis and
Skoplje the three of us in our little
car attracted considerable attention.
Crowds would follow us through
the streets and about 100 people
would gather around whenever we
stopped for gas.
They were all very friendly. And
anybody who could speak English
or French would come to talk to us
and offer to order our meals for us
or to show us the city. Mothers gave
us their babies to hold the steering
wheel or blow the horn. As we
left Yugoslavia, the friendly •cus
toms officers gave us a going-away
present of three watermelons.


CROWD GATHERS—Yugoslavs turn out to stare at the three
American travellers in the* southern city of Skoplje. They
touched the car, crawled under it, were amazed to find the motor
in the back.
