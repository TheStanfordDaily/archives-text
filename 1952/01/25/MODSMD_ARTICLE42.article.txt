# Cagers Attempt Comeback In Stewart Tilt Saturday
## 
### MIKE HUDSON 
Tomorrow night at 8, Stanford's cagers will attempt to get back
on the win trail when they host the star-studded Stewart Chevrolet
outfit in the local Pavilion.
As of last night, Card Coach Bob Burnett said he'd start his
perennial quintet of Ed Tucker, Jim Walsh, Jim Ramstead, Ron

Tomsic, and Olie Suzdaleff. How--*
ever, ne adrnilted he might change
his mind before game time. In any
event, Burnett promised that he'd
clear the bench tomorrow night and
in the four upcoming independent
battles in an effort to find the right
combination to revive Stanford's
hopes for the PCC crown.
The Cards will only take a light
workout tonight to stay fresh for to
morrow's tilt.
Stewarts Field balanced Team
The Chevvies will field a well
balanced team of ex-Pacific Coast
stars. Last year's AAU champs have
become just another ball club, how
ever, since their great star, George
ley, departed for the service.
In last year's Card-Chevvie game,
Yardley shelled his old teammates
with a - point barrage as the
CheVvies buried Stanford 80 to 64.
Spark plug of the Chevrolet team
is Cliff Crandall, one of basketball's
smoothest players. The poker-faced
ex-Oregon State flash yawns his
way through one flawless game
after another. His effortless grace
and smooth floor play have earned
him the nickname "The Big Cat."
He was All-Coast anil third-string
Ail-American in college.
The other guard post is handled
by Frank Kuzara, who starred for
USF's national champions three
years ago. The pint-sized Kuzara
is a deadly two - handed set artist
and a real hustler.
Bearman at Center
At center will be G-ft. 5-in. Don
Henrickson, Henrickson was a late

starter on the basketball horizon.
He was cut off the squad at Palo
Alto High. At Cal, he showed
flashes of brilliance, but his inex
perience and awkwardness often
showed too. Playing for three years
with the Stewarts, he has acquired
a 4 lot more experience and polish
although he is still improving stead
ily. In addition to being effective
around the boards, he has developed
into an accurate shot from either
corner.
Erratic George Walker will open
at one forward post. Walker played
tor Cal's great teams of five and
six years ago. He likes to shoot
irom way out and when he's hot,
lie's unstoppable. He doesn't get hot
too often.
Bob Payne will probably round
out the starting five. Bob was All-
Northern Division for Oregon State
last year.
Alameida Clievvie Coach
Hank Luisetti, Stanford's basket
ball immortal, has stepped down as
head coach of the Chevvies, and
Bob Alameida has replaced him.
After a slow start, the Stewarts are
now playing over .500 ball in the
tough National Industrial League
and have won five in a row. They're
red-hot. It's interesting to note that
man-for-rnan they're almost identi
cal in height with Stanford, so the
Cards should get their share of the
bounds for a change.
In a prliminaty battle, the youth
ful Stanford Braves will tangle with
Menlo JC. Tip-off for this game is
set for G o'clock. Braves and Men
lomen have split in their two pre
vious battles.

lomen have split in their two pre
vious battles.


808 BURNETT
—Hopes for comeback
Tomorrow night at 8, Stanford's cagers will attempt to get back
on the win trail when they host the star-studded Stewart Chevrolet
outfit in the local Pavilion.
As of last night, Card Coach Bob Burnett said he'd start his
perennial quintet of Ed Tucker, Jim Walsh, Jim Ramstead, Ron

Tomsic, and Olie Suzdaleff. How--*
ever, ne adrnilted he might change
his mind before game time. In any
event, Burnett promised that he'd
clear the bench tomorrow night and
in the four upcoming independent
battles in an effort to find the right
combination to revive Stanford's
hopes for the PCC crown.
The Cards will only take a light
workout tonight to stay fresh for to
morrow's tilt.
Stewarts Field balanced Team
The Chevvies will field a well
balanced team of ex-Pacific Coast
stars. Last year's AAU champs have
become just another ball club, how
ever, since their great star, George
ley, departed for the service.
In last year's Card-Chevvie game,
Yardley shelled his old teammates
with a - point barrage as the
CheVvies buried Stanford 80 to 64.
Spark plug of the Chevrolet team
is Cliff Crandall, one of basketball's
smoothest players. The poker-faced
ex-Oregon State flash yawns his
way through one flawless game
after another. His effortless grace
and smooth floor play have earned
him the nickname "The Big Cat."
He was All-Coast anil third-string
Ail-American in college.
The other guard post is handled
by Frank Kuzara, who starred for
USF's national champions three
years ago. The pint-sized Kuzara
is a deadly two - handed set artist
and a real hustler.
Bearman at Center
At center will be G-ft. 5-in. Don
Henrickson, Henrickson was a late

starter on the basketball horizon.
He was cut off the squad at Palo
Alto High. At Cal, he showed
flashes of brilliance, but his inex
perience and awkwardness often
showed too. Playing for three years
with the Stewarts, he has acquired
a 4 lot more experience and polish
although he is still improving stead
ily. In addition to being effective
around the boards, he has developed
into an accurate shot from either
corner.
Erratic George Walker will open
at one forward post. Walker played
tor Cal's great teams of five and
six years ago. He likes to shoot
irom way out and when he's hot,
lie's unstoppable. He doesn't get hot
too often.
Bob Payne will probably round
out the starting five. Bob was All-
Northern Division for Oregon State
last year.
Alameida Clievvie Coach
Hank Luisetti, Stanford's basket
ball immortal, has stepped down as
head coach of the Chevvies, and
Bob Alameida has replaced him.
After a slow start, the Stewarts are
now playing over .500 ball in the
tough National Industrial League
and have won five in a row. They're
red-hot. It's interesting to note that
man-for-rnan they're almost identi
cal in height with Stanford, so the
Cards should get their share of the
bounds for a change.
In a prliminaty battle, the youth
ful Stanford Braves will tangle with
Menlo JC. Tip-off for this game is
set for G o'clock. Braves and Men
lomen have split in their two pre
vious battles.
