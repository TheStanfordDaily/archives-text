# Brave Cagers Face Menlo, City Champs
## 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanford's JV basketballers, coming into their mid-season form,
face George Washington High and Menlo JC, two tough oppo
nents, on their own boards this weekend.
At 2:30 today, Gus Chavalas' charges play the boys from Wash
ington High, considered the best prep team in the San Francisco

area and as yet undefeated.
Led by Jim Moya, A 1 Hood, and
A 1 Winetrub, three high - scoring
cagers, the visiting Eagles are ex
pected to put up a good game
against the slightly favored Cards.
Saturday night, in the prelimi
nary game before the Varsity-Stew
aret affair, the Braves
host Menlo JC in the rubber game
jf their three-game series. In the
irst game, played early in the sea
son, Menlo, at present leading their
JC league, took a close, hotly con
tested affair 54-52.
Last weekend, showing better
form than they have all year, the
Slaves retaliated with a stunning 65
10 40 victory over the Menlo men,
and came on their own as a "team."
They played good solid ball, and led
all the way.
If they continue playing this type
of ball, with control of the boards
coupled with a deadly last break,
the Cards will probably add two
more victories to their present G-5
record. *
Starting lineups for the games
wlil probably be Roger Irvine and
Dick Carver at the forwards, 6-ft,
7-in. Russ Lawler at center and
Wayne Lockhart and Jim Juiinson
at the guard spots. As in past JV
games, all ol the 14-man squad will
probably see action, especially
Howard Schwartz, George Caras,
Erick Witenberg, and Jim Westfall.
By using liberal substitutions, Coach
Chavalas is giving all his men the
experience that they lack.
His experimenting seems to be
paying off—if his boys keep coming
up as they have been, prospects for
the remainder of the season will not
be indicative of their present medi
ocre record.

aret affair, the Braves
host Menlo JC in the rubber game
jf their three-game series. In the
irst game, played early in the sea
son, Menlo, at present leading their
JC league, took a close, hotly con
tested affair 54-52.
Last weekend, showing better
form than they have all year, the
Slaves retaliated with a stunning 65
10 40 victory over the Menlo men,
and came on their own as a "team."
They played good solid ball, and led
all the way.
If they continue playing this type
of ball, with control of the boards
coupled with a deadly last break,
the Cards will probably add two
more victories to their present G-5
record. *
Starting lineups for the games
wlil probably be Roger Irvine and
Dick Carver at the forwards, 6-ft,
7-in. Russ Lawler at center and
Wayne Lockhart and Jim Juiinson
at the guard spots. As in past JV
games, all ol the 14-man squad will
probably see action, especially
Howard Schwartz, George Caras,
Erick Witenberg, and Jim Westfall.
By using liberal substitutions, Coach
Chavalas is giving all his men the
experience that they lack.
His experimenting seems to be
paying off—if his boys keep coming
up as they have been, prospects for
the remainder of the season will not
be indicative of their present medi
ocre record.
