# A 						LOOK AT PCC RECORDS

### 
A record that Stanford might eas
ily topple this year is UCLA's 744
points in a season, or 62 points a
game. Stanford, despite their last
place peg in the league, has tallied
412 points in six contests for a 68.8-
point average. Stanford is almost
certain to break the ignominious
record of having the most points
scored against them.
