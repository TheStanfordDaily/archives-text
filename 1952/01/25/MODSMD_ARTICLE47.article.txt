# Trotters Clown, Joke, and Win Games
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Basketball fans in the Bay Area
are in for a rare treat this week
end. The Harlem Globetrotters, bas
ketball's most colorful team, are
again in town.
During the weekend they will be
in San Jose and vicinity. On Tues
day and Wednesday they played to
a capacity crowd in San' Francisco.
We went up to the game Wednes
day and what we saw, although
somewhat similar to basketball, was
practically a sport in itself.
The pattern of play was fairly
obvious. The Trotters play to the
best of their ability for approxi
mately three quarters. By that time
they have piled up a lead of some
20-odd points and they can begirt
their act.
The Trotters hit 3G out of the
(55 shots they took for a phenomenal
.554 percentage. Goose Tatum as
usual led the parade with 26 points
and a .684 shooting average. Mar
quis Haynes, the dribbling special
ist, hit on (54 per cent, and Clarence
Wilson, who took nothing but long
shots, 58 per cent. They scored l(i
and 14 points respectively.
When the Trotters had a com
fortable (54-415 lead at the end of
the third quarter, the clowning be
gan in earnest. Goose latum made
it a point to shoot his free throws
by bouncing the ball off his head in
the direction of the basket; a bat
tery of Rookie Brown arid Marquis
Haynes got a count of 0 and 2
against Tatum, only to have him

belt \the ball into the second row of
the balcony; and Haynes tried to
kick three field goals from the 20-
yard line and almost made one.
The most humorous incident,
however,\ occurred midway in the
fourth quarter. Tatum was on the
line for one shot. He poised, took
aim, and tlien shot. Everyone leaped
forward "but Tatum nonchalantly
drew the ball back to him and

walked away, leaving players scat
tered in various positions hither and
yon under the basket, in anticipa
tion of the rebound that never
came.
It seems that Tatum had substi
tuted his own ball, one which had
an elastic band on it, enabling him
to draw it back to him after it had
already left his hand.

yard line and almost made one.
The most humorous incident,
however,\ occurred midway in the
fourth quarter. Tatum was on the
line for one shot. He poised, took
aim, and tlien shot. Everyone leaped
forward "but Tatum nonchalantly
drew the ball back to him and

walked away, leaving players scat
tered in various positions hither and
yon under the basket, in anticipa
tion of the rebound that never
came.
It seems that Tatum had substi
tuted his own ball, one which had
an elastic band on it, enabling him
to draw it back to him after it had
already left his hand.
Basketball fans in the Bay Area
are in for a rare treat this week
end. The Harlem Globetrotters, bas
ketball's most colorful team, are
again in town.
During the weekend they will be
in San Jose and vicinity. On Tues
day and Wednesday they played to
a capacity crowd in San' Francisco.
We went up to the game Wednes
day and what we saw, although
somewhat similar to basketball, was
practically a sport in itself.
The pattern of play was fairly
obvious. The Trotters play to the
best of their ability for approxi
mately three quarters. By that time
they have piled up a lead of some
20-odd points and they can begirt
their act.
The Trotters hit 3G out of the
(55 shots they took for a phenomenal
.554 percentage. Goose Tatum as
usual led the parade with 26 points
and a .684 shooting average. Mar
quis Haynes, the dribbling special
ist, hit on (54 per cent, and Clarence
Wilson, who took nothing but long
shots, 58 per cent. They scored l(i
and 14 points respectively.
When the Trotters had a com
fortable (54-415 lead at the end of
the third quarter, the clowning be
gan in earnest. Goose latum made
it a point to shoot his free throws
by bouncing the ball off his head in
the direction of the basket; a bat
tery of Rookie Brown arid Marquis
Haynes got a count of 0 and 2
against Tatum, only to have him

belt \the ball into the second row of
the balcony; and Haynes tried to
kick three field goals from the 20-
yard line and almost made one.
