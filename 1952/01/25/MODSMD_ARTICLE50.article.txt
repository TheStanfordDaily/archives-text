# LATE MURAL FLASH
## 
### 
Bob Madearis and his ATO team
mates, who scored almost at will,
ran up an impressive 63 to 11 vic
tory last night in the Encina Gym
over an outclassed Sigma Chi I
five. The Tau's starting five of
Madearis, Ray Swarts, Hal Ellis, A 1
Talboy, and Clayton Neill utilized
an exceptionally effective fast-break
attack and divided the scoring al
most evenly among them.
