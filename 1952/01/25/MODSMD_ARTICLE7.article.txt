# Monteux Leads Last Farm Concert, Feb. 5
## 
### 
Music-lovers who come to
Stanford year alter year to hear
"Papa" Monteux conduct the San
Francisco Symphony in Me
morial Hall will hear him in this
campus setting for the last time
on February 5.
Pierre Monteux, after conducting
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra for 17 years, will retire at
the end of this concert season. The
maestro will be 77 on April 4.
The bouncy little Frenchman,
"Papa" to San Francisco music lov
ers and"the Maitre" to the whole
music world, was characterized by
Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops,
one of his students, in the following
! words:
"A wonderful repartee, and a
merry sense of humor, coupled with
a profound comprehenson of music,
make the Maitre the man he is—a
conductor with an approach to his
art that is refreshingly lacking in
hysteria.
"These qualities," states Fiedler,
have helped him in developing the
San Francisco Symphony into one
of the world's greatest orchestras."
Monteux has conducted great mus
ical institutions the world over, in
cluding the Berlin Philharmonic, the
Vienna Philharmonic, and Amster
dam's Concertgebouw Orchestra.
In stepping down from his con
ductor's podium, Monteux has no
intention of leaving the musical
world. He will continue to conduct
when the spirit moves him, and will
also continue to teach conducting to
groups of students at his home in
Maine.
