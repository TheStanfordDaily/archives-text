Nearly half of those who study or
work on the Stanford campus own
cars, Police Chief Gordon Davis re
ported.
Advising that daily more than
4,000 autos are driven on campus,
the chief pointed out that Stanford's
student and faculty body is one of
the most car-wealthy groups in the
nation.
However, the number of cars on
campus is presenting a growing po
lice problem, Davis said, as he told
how Farm parking facilities are
swamped each day. With only 3,325
parking spaces available, some 700
cars are forced to park illegally, he
stated.
The lack of parking areas causes
considerable classroom confusion,
according to one professor, who
claimed that he must delay the
opening of class to allow troubled
parkers time to get to class.
Plans for the extension of cam
pus parking are now under consid
eration, with completion of a new
Stern Hall parking lot expected by
spring.
