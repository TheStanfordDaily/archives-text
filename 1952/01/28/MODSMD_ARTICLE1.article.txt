# Stanford Bows to Chevvies, 68-63
## Henricksen Scores 24 
### MIKE HUDSON 
A classy Stewart Chevrolet
outfit wore down Stanford to
hand the Indians their third
straight loss, 68 to 63, before a
sparse Saturday night crowd in
the Pavilion.
For three quarters, the Cards
waged a heroic brittle. Don Hen
rickson and ex-Santa Clara flash
Joe Creenbach started hitting from
the opening whistle and soon the
Stewarts piled up a strong 16-10
lead, and looked like they might
never be headed.
But Ollie SuzdalcfT hit a driving
lay-up, Eon Toinsic a 25-footer, and
Don Ue Long two free throws to
pull Stanford to within one point of
the Stewarts. Then Eddie Tucker
missed a long .shot, but followed it
up to give Stanford the lead.
Tin* next 20 minutes saw the
lead change hands 11 times. For
Stanford, the big four — Jim
Walsh, Jim Ranistead, Fd Tucker,
and Ron Tomsic all dumped in
points at a slow but steady pace.
For the Chevvies, it was Hen
rickson's tip-ins and the long
easts of Frank Kuzara doing the
damage. The half-time score was
knotted at 2!) all.
Despite the obvious polish and
class of the Stewarts, the Cards
only trailed 47-4 late in the third
quarter. Then the roof caved in.
George Walker hit a lay-up and
three free throws to give the Chev
vies a seven-point lead.
To add to the Card woes, Walsh
fouled out and Tomsic had to retire
from the tilt with a sprained ankle.
The Chevvies couldn't be caught.
High point man for the night
and outstanding man on the floor
was Don Ilenricksen with 24
points. Ilenricksen got cut off his
high-school squad, and at Cal he
was still ungainly and awkward
and only played because of his
size. Now, lie has been coached


VYING FOR REBOUND—Stanford's Eddie Tucker goes way up off the Pavilion hardwood to
pick off a bounding ball from Don Henricksen, the Chevrolets'.giant 6' 7" center. Bob Payne
(21) watches the action. In the jam is Captain Jim Ramstead. —Daily photo by Dick Schwarz

In addition to being a great tip-in
artist, he .showed fine defensive
ability u:i lie held Jim Ramstead to
J1 points, blocked several shots and
passes in inid-air, and controlled
both backboards fairly well. Walker
and (Jrt enbach scored 13 and 12 re
ipectively.
Kddie Tucker led the Cards with
18 points while Toinsie and Karn
£tead had 11. Greenbach and Ku

zara did a good job of guarding
Tucker and Tomsic.
Don Carlson, who was forced to
quit the Stanford team because of
scholastic failure, saw a little ac
tion with the Chevvies and looked

Kon Tomsic, v.ho retired in the I
last quarter of Saturday night's I
game with a timed ankle, will
probably not start Wednesday's
game against San Jose State. His
ankle should heal sulliciently to
allow hiin to p'ay in next week's
I'hillipOilers game. Ollie Su:'.- !
dalelT, who also injured his ankle j
against the Stewart ;, should be all |
right by Wednesday.

j good. His loss w:is a crushing blow

In a brief ball-time ceremony,
Jim Ramstead and Jack O Sulli
van wive given the Hank Lui .etti
Award for the most valuable
players last year, 'i he hoys were
given watches by their ex-Coach
Everett Dean.
On Wedne day night, the Card*,
will play San Jo e State in the Pa

ennial AAU champs, the Phillips
Oilers, will meet Stanford in the

A classy Stewart Chevrolet
outfit wore down Stanford to
hand the Indians their third
straight loss, 68 to 63, before a
sparse Saturday night crowd in
the Pavilion.
For three quarters, the Cards
waged a heroic brittle. Don Hen
rickson and ex-Santa Clara flash
Joe Creenbach started hitting from
the opening whistle and soon the
Stewarts piled up a strong 16-10
lead, and looked like they might
never be headed.
But Ollie SuzdalcfT hit a driving
lay-up, Eon Toinsic a 25-footer, and
Don Ue Long two free throws to
pull Stanford to within one point of
the Stewarts. Then Eddie Tucker
missed a long .shot, but followed it
up to give Stanford the lead.
Tin* next 20 minutes saw the
lead change hands 11 times. For
Stanford, the big four — Jim
Walsh, Jim Ranistead, Fd Tucker,
and Ron Tomsic all dumped in
points at a slow but steady pace.
For the Chevvies, it was Hen
rickson's tip-ins and the long
easts of Frank Kuzara doing the
damage. The half-time score was
knotted at 2!) all.
Despite the obvious polish and
class of the Stewarts, the Cards
only trailed 47-4 late in the third
quarter. Then the roof caved in.
George Walker hit a lay-up and
three free throws to give the Chev
vies a seven-point lead.
To add to the Card woes, Walsh
fouled out and Tomsic had to retire
from the tilt with a sprained ankle.
The Chevvies couldn't be caught.
High point man for the night
and outstanding man on the floor
was Don Ilenricksen with 24
points. Ilenricksen got cut off his
high-school squad, and at Cal he
was still ungainly and awkward
and only played because of his
size. Now, lie has been coached

A classy Stewart Chevrolet
outfit wore down Stanford to
hand the Indians their third
straight loss, 68 to 63, before a
sparse Saturday night crowd in
the Pavilion.
For three quarters, the Cards
waged a heroic brittle. Don Hen
rickson and ex-Santa Clara flash
Joe Creenbach started hitting from
the opening whistle and soon the
Stewarts piled up a strong 16-10
lead, and looked like they might
never be headed.
But Ollie SuzdalcfT hit a driving
lay-up, Eon Toinsic a 25-footer, and
Don Ue Long two free throws to
pull Stanford to within one point of
the Stewarts. Then Eddie Tucker
missed a long .shot, but followed it
up to give Stanford the lead.
Tin* next 20 minutes saw the
lead change hands 11 times. For
Stanford, the big four — Jim
Walsh, Jim Ranistead, Fd Tucker,
and Ron Tomsic all dumped in
points at a slow but steady pace.
For the Chevvies, it was Hen
rickson's tip-ins and the long
easts of Frank Kuzara doing the
damage. The half-time score was
knotted at 2!) all.
Despite the obvious polish and
class of the Stewarts, the Cards
only trailed 47-4 late in the third
quarter. Then the roof caved in.
George Walker hit a lay-up and
three free throws to give the Chev
vies a seven-point lead.
To add to the Card woes, Walsh
fouled out and Tomsic had to retire
from the tilt with a sprained ankle.
The Chevvies couldn't be caught.
High point man for the night
and outstanding man on the floor
was Don Ilenricksen with 24
points. Ilenricksen got cut off his
high-school squad, and at Cal he
was still ungainly and awkward
and only played because of his
size. Now, lie has been coached


VYING FOR REBOUND—Stanford's Eddie Tucker goes way up off the Pavilion hardwood to
pick off a bounding ball from Don Henricksen, the Chevrolets'.giant 6' 7" center. Bob Payne

Kddie Tucker led the Cards with
