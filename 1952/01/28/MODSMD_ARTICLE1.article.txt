# Stanford Bows to Chevvies, 68-63
## Henricksen Scores 24 
### MIKE HUDSON 
A classy Stewart Chevrolet
outfit wore down Stanford to
hand the Indians their third
straight loss, 68 to 63, before a
sparse Saturday night crowd in
the Pavilion.
For three quarters, the Cards
waged a heroic brittle. Don Hen
rickson and ex-Santa Clara flash
Joe Creenbach started hitting from
the opening whistle and soon the
Stewarts piled up a strong 16-10
lead, and looked like they might
never be headed.
But Ollie SuzdalcfT hit a driving
lay-up, Eon Toinsic a 25-footer, and
Don Ue Long two free throws to
pull Stanford to within one point of
the Stewarts. Then Eddie Tucker
missed a long .shot, but followed it
up to give Stanford the lead.
Tin* next 20 minutes saw the
lead change hands 11 times. For
Stanford, the big four — Jim
Walsh, Jim Ranistead, Fd Tucker,
and Ron Tomsic all dumped in
points at a slow but steady pace.
For the Chevvies, it was Hen
rickson's tip-ins and the long
easts of Frank Kuzara doing the
damage. The half-time score was
knotted at 2!) all.
Despite the obvious polish and
class of the Stewarts, the Cards
only trailed 47-4 late in the third
quarter. Then the roof caved in.
George Walker hit a lay-up and
three free throws to give the Chev
vies a seven-point lead.
To add to the Card woes, Walsh
fouled out and Tomsic had to retire
from the tilt with a sprained ankle.
The Chevvies couldn't be caught.
High point man for the night
and outstanding man on the floor
was Don Ilenricksen with 24
points. Ilenricksen got cut off his
high-school squad, and at Cal he
was still ungainly and awkward
and only played because of his
size. Now, lie has been coached
