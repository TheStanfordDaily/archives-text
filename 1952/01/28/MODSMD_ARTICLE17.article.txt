# Daily Californian Gets 'Adviser'
## 
### 
The University ol California Board of Regents
has saddled the Daily Californian, student
paper, with a day-to-day adviser, plus an ad
visory board. The action backs up a recom
mendation made by the student executive com
mitter at Cal.
The whole business started when two articles
were printed last fall about a Communist festi
val in East Berlin. The articles were by non
staffers, clearly signed.
Interesting comments followed the an
nouncement of the Board's decision. Univer
sity President Robert G. Sproul said . . Even
if mistakes are made, I'm sure there are no Com
munists or Communist sympathizers on the
staff."
Yet he agreed to the adviser plan, which
amounts to censorship.
As might be expected, John Francis Neylan
had some interesting comments to deliver.
Neylan first praised the loyalty (sic) of the over
whelming majority of the students-and then
said he was against censorship.
"The fact is the paper has been censored by
a small group which kept out American doc
trine" he is quoted as saying in the San Fran
cisco Examiner. Oh, sure.

So Neylan, who is against censorship and
for loyalty, wants a day to day adviser to watch
over the Daily Cal.
We wonder which is really more dangerous
in ihe long i un, censoring a free newspaper or
printing two non-policy articles in a reader's
forum section?
