# BULL SESSION

(Editor's note: Today's Bull Session is the first in
n short scries of reprints from past years, all con
sidered "minor classics" of their kind. Dick Mc-
Lean and Pete Grothe, regular Daily Bull Session
ers, have chosen today's column and the ones to
follow. McLean and Cirothe will resume their own
columns in a few days. Below, Vic Palmieri, now a
student in Stanford Law School, gives his breezy
comments on the ski rack phenomenon, 'ibis Bull
Session appeared in The Daily Jan. 29, 1951.)
I see where a new fad has hit the campus. Ski
racks. Everybody's riding around with ski racks.
You're just not with it around here any more with
out a ski rack.
Time was when you had to have a ukelele in your
hip pocket to get along in collegiate circles. I thought
that was bad. Now I find you're a square if you
don't have 40 to 50 pounds of scrap metal sitting on

top of your car at all times.
What you're supposed to do if
you can't afford a car, T don't
know. If being in the swing of
things means what it should to
you, I suppose you could carry
the whole thing around on your
back. It mipht eventually mean
curvature or the spine, but the
social prestige would be incalcul
able. Furthermore, you'd be in-

valuable at cocktail parties as a conversation piece.
Of course there's always the danger that some fresh
man jjnight mistake you for Rocket Man, in which
case you'd have the whole freshman class on your
back.
But the fact remains that one must have his ski
rack, or one just doesn't exist, socially speaking.

The implications of not having a ski rack arc ob
vious, of course.
In the first place, it means that you are not ready
to leave immediately for the "slopes." This may
seem absurd—after all, where else could one wish
to be than the "slopes"—but, the suspicion is always
there.
In connection with this, it's impoitant that one
never chives about with his ski rack loaded with
skis. This would defeat the whole psychology of ski
racks. The empty ski rack gives the necessary
"casual sportsman" impression. Furthermore, people
are more careful in their dealings with you. They
realize that you are ready to leave for the "slopes"
at a moment's notice, and that one cross word and
you may load your ski rack and zoom away.
Of course, the most damning implication of buying
a ski rack is that you do not enjoy skiing. Don't
get excited. I know you do. But some people are
just malicious.
Alter all, who could help enjoying a sport that
involves going broke, breaking your neck, and
flunking out? Who but a fool would not enjoy
getting up at 4 in the morning and driving 200
miles along icy mountain roads in sub-zero tem
peratures tii slide down a hill?
Who could be insensible to the joy of spending an
afternoon digging oneself out of a glacier, and then,
bruised and wet and frozen, driving for hours and
hours through the cold night hack to campus? All
for as little as $27.50 a day!
No, my friends, you love it as I do, I know. That is
why I am so anxious that you should not suffer from
the shame of not having a ski rack. And just think!
I happen to have a beautiful ski rack that you can
buy right now for the paltry sum of $10 (ten stones).
Don't ask me why I'm selling. I told you, I love skiing.

No, my friends, you love it as I do, I know. That is
why I am so anxious that you should not suffer from
the shame of not having a ski rack. And just think!
I happen to have a beautiful ski rack that you can
buy right now for the paltry sum of $10 (ten stones).
Don't ask me why I'm selling. I told you, I love skiing.

I see where a new fad has hit the campus. Ski
racks. Everybody's riding around with ski racks.
You're just not with it around here any more with
out a ski rack.
Time was when you had to have a ukelele in your
hip pocket to get along in collegiate circles. I thought
that was bad. Now I find you're a square if you
don't have 40 to 50 pounds of scrap metal sitting on

top of your car at all times.
What you're supposed to do if
you can't afford a car, T don't
know. If being in the swing of
things means what it should to
you, I suppose you could carry
the whole thing around on your
back. It mipht eventually mean
curvature or the spine, but the
social prestige would be incalcul
able. Furthermore, you'd be in-

valuable at cocktail parties as a conversation piece.
Of course there's always the danger that some fresh
man jjnight mistake you for Rocket Man, in which
case you'd have the whole freshman class on your
back.
But the fact remains that one must have his ski
rack, or one just doesn't exist, socially speaking.

The implications of not having a ski rack arc ob
vious, of course.
In the first place, it means that you are not ready
to leave immediately for the "slopes." This may
seem absurd—after all, where else could one wish
to be than the "slopes"—but, the suspicion is always
there.
In connection with this, it's impoitant that one
never chives about with his ski rack loaded with
skis. This would defeat the whole psychology of ski
racks. The empty ski rack gives the necessary
"casual sportsman" impression. Furthermore, people
are more careful in their dealings with you. They
realize that you are ready to leave for the "slopes"
at a moment's notice, and that one cross word and
you may load your ski rack and zoom away.
Of course, the most damning implication of buying
a ski rack is that you do not enjoy skiing. Don't
get excited. I know you do. But some people are
just malicious.
Alter all, who could help enjoying a sport that
involves going broke, breaking your neck, and
flunking out? Who but a fool would not enjoy
getting up at 4 in the morning and driving 200
miles along icy mountain roads in sub-zero tem
peratures tii slide down a hill?
Who could be insensible to the joy of spending an
afternoon digging oneself out of a glacier, and then,
bruised and wet and frozen, driving for hours and
hours through the cold night hack to campus? All
for as little as $27.50 a day!
