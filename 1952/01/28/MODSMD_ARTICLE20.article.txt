# CAMPUS OPINION
## In Defense of Daily Abbreviations 
### 
To the Editor:
TJpon seeing a second letter in Thp Daily concern
ing abbreviations at Stanford, I feel that I should
like to comment on them. In many professions, and
in different sections of the country, people use jar
gon to express themselves. Their own special lan
guage brings them to a sense of unity. Athletes use
expressive slang. "Di2zy" Dean is noted for his

unique vocabulary. It seems to me that this type of
speech lends character to those who use it.
Abbreviations are a part of the "Stanford Spirit";
the abbreviated names that students give things that
they know well are like the nicknames they give
to those they love. Our "Stanford language" adds
to the character of our campus—it helps to make
Stanford what it is.
