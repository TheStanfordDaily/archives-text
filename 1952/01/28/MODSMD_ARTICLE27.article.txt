# Far Eastern Expert Tells Of Asian Red Menace
## 
### RUTH JAHNKE 
"What kind of a war are we going to tight in Asia?" This ques
tion was raided by Albert Haviuiholt when interviewed during
his week as visiting lecturer from the Institute of Current World
Affairs. He answered his own question, saying that until the
United States fomulates an international policy and decides what

the purpose ot the war is, the
tion is unanswerable .
He arrived Dec. 29 from Hong
Kong after spending six months in
the Far East. A a result, he is ex
ceptionally well informed on the ac
tual situation in Forrno a, China,
and Indo-China.
When asked what he thought of
the Chinese Nationalists' efforts to
launch an offensive against the
mainland, he replied that it's not a
quesetion of what they, or we, de
sire, but what we're capable of. He
added that "if we're lucky" we
could raise 300,000 soldiers on For
mosa to oppose ten million in China
proper. His interpretation of the
whole problem was that (lie Na -
tionaiists' plan to reclaim China is
''a myth being used to confuse the
Amei'ican people."
The fate of Indo-Chma now de
pends on whether the Chinese
Reds want to keep it a drawn out
affair with the emphasis on an ex
tensive guerrilla - type re i:,lance
or intend to take over the area
quickly and completely. As it
stands now, the Ku.opean re
sources are being drained by the
constant Red effort.
Ravenholt spent, the last six
months as a foreign service corre
spondent for the Chicago Daily
News. He will lecture at s.ix more
universities across the nation while
on leave, then "will probably re
turn to China next summer." Ra
venholt worked for United Press
in the Far East from 1939 to 1947,
then returned to visit universities
the summer of 1947 with the Insti
tute of Current World Affah 3 with
which he is still associated.
The question ot wTiether or not
the Chinese Communists' govern
ment should be represented in the
United -Nations also came up for
discussion. Ravenholt answered that
query with several of his own.
"What kind of a United Nations
do we want? Do we want it. to con
sist of a group of allies working to
gether for the good of their re
spective countries, or do we want
a world-wide workshop that will
solve international problems? Do
we want to fight with or <|pal with
the Chinese Communists? If the
latter course is chosen, means of
communication now non-existent
must be set up.
"If we want to continue fighting
the Chinese Reds, we have to u< -
knowledge the consequences of
the action. liido-China and Siain
would probably go too."
Another often-disputed point was

brought up. That is, would China
he better off under Chinese Com
munists' rule or under that of ihe
Nationals t;i? Eavenholt stated that
the Chinese have peace and stabil
ity now for (he fir: t time since 1937.
He also observed that Ihe educated
Masses (professors, students, uffi
.ials, etc.) have benefitted under
Communist rule, but that the large
farming class is more heavily taxed
than before.
In the final analysis, Ravenholt
pointed out that if capabilities are
realized and international action
planned accordingly, progress can
be /uade. As Jong as the bases for
policies are merely what individual
countries desire, little tasting good
will be accomplished.

farming class is more heavily taxed
than before.
In the final analysis, Ravenholt
pointed out that if capabilities are
realized and international action
planned accordingly, progress can
be /uade. As Jong as the bases for
policies are merely what individual
countries desire, little tasting good
will be accomplished.
"What kind of a war are we going to tight in Asia?" This ques
tion was raided by Albert Haviuiholt when interviewed during
his week as visiting lecturer from the Institute of Current World
Affairs. He answered his own question, saying that until the
United States fomulates an international policy and decides what

the purpose ot the war is, the
tion is unanswerable .
He arrived Dec. 29 from Hong
Kong after spending six months in
the Far East. A a result, he is ex
ceptionally well informed on the ac
tual situation in Forrno a, China,
and Indo-China.
When asked what he thought of
the Chinese Nationalists' efforts to
launch an offensive against the
mainland, he replied that it's not a
quesetion of what they, or we, de
sire, but what we're capable of. He
added that "if we're lucky" we
could raise 300,000 soldiers on For
mosa to oppose ten million in China
proper. His interpretation of the
whole problem was that (lie Na -
tionaiists' plan to reclaim China is
''a myth being used to confuse the
Amei'ican people."
The fate of Indo-Chma now de
pends on whether the Chinese
Reds want to keep it a drawn out
affair with the emphasis on an ex
tensive guerrilla - type re i:,lance
or intend to take over the area
quickly and completely. As it
stands now, the Ku.opean re
sources are being drained by the
constant Red effort.
Ravenholt spent, the last six
months as a foreign service corre
spondent for the Chicago Daily
News. He will lecture at s.ix more
universities across the nation while
on leave, then "will probably re
turn to China next summer." Ra
venholt worked for United Press
in the Far East from 1939 to 1947,
then returned to visit universities
the summer of 1947 with the Insti
tute of Current World Affah 3 with
which he is still associated.
The question ot wTiether or not
the Chinese Communists' govern
ment should be represented in the
United -Nations also came up for
discussion. Ravenholt answered that
query with several of his own.
"What kind of a United Nations
do we want? Do we want it. to con
sist of a group of allies working to
gether for the good of their re
spective countries, or do we want
a world-wide workshop that will
solve international problems? Do
we want to fight with or <|pal with
the Chinese Communists? If the
latter course is chosen, means of
communication now non-existent
must be set up.
"If we want to continue fighting
the Chinese Reds, we have to u< -
knowledge the consequences of
the action. liido-China and Siain
would probably go too."
Another often-disputed point was

brought up. That is, would China
he better off under Chinese Com
munists' rule or under that of ihe
Nationals t;i? Eavenholt stated that
the Chinese have peace and stabil
ity now for (he fir: t time since 1937.
He also observed that Ihe educated
Masses (professors, students, uffi
.ials, etc.) have benefitted under
Communist rule, but that the large
farming class is more heavily taxed
than before.
