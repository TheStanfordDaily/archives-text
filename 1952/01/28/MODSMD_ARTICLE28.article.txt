# Musical Biography, A Mastery of Cliches
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
Caution, Now playing at the Varsity is a picture called "I'll See
You in My Dreams," and that's not the hall of it. Another in Holly
wood's endless series of musical biographies, this one deals with
the life and times of lyricist Gus Kahn and shows a mastery of
cliches.
Not that we have anything against Mr. Kahn. He provided

words for a lot of nice tunes ("Pret-'"
ty Baby," "Love Me or Leave Me,"
"Toot Toot Tootsie," "It Had to Be
You," etc.). But his list, at least as

seen through
Hollywood, jogs
the lenses of
up Tin Pan Al
ley with all the
individuality of a
low - rent hous
ing unit.

The only cliche of musicals that
is missing is Technicolor—and that,
perhaps, is the one cliche with
which musicals can least well dis
pense.
Otherwise, everything is intact.
The advent of the proceedings is
signaled by the usual horses lug
ging the usual wagons across the
usual turn-of-the-century set, and
thereafter it is only a matter of
some 90 minutes before Mr. Kahn
(Danny Thomas) has been put
through the well - known pace'.:
struggle, success, defeat, triumphant
return.
Item: The heart-warmingly hum
ble Gus dragging his first necktie
through a bowl of soup at a dinner
party.
Item: The Woman Behind the

Man, in this case Doris Day, who
doesn't miss a single song cue.
(Incidentally, Miss Day, apparently
encouraged by her recent box
office successes, has now carried
her bourn iness to such extents
that one wonders how she was
kept wilhin camera range.)
Item: The Other Woman, this
time Patrice Wymore Flynn, who
gives audiences a chance to set
what Errol has been up to lately.
In conclusion, "I'll See You in My
Dreams" should have stayed where
it started—in tlie dreams of the men
who produced it.
