conferred with the Daily Cal edi

needed.

com stepped in «nd proposed nol

also a flay -to - day supervisor to
check what was printed.
The regents favored the proposal
of the ASUC Excorn. The papei
will now be under the advi or .hir
appointed by Sproul, hut also y
appointed by Sproul ,but also i
day-to-day adviser, appointed by
the ASUC Excom.

printed las! semester by (In- Daily
Cal, Sproul reported that 9(1 per
