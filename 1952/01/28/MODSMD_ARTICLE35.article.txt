# Undefeated Spartans Nip Tough Wrestlers
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's wrestling team, dis- i
playing unexpected power, came
within seven points of toppling the
mighty Spartans of San Jose State j
| in a meet held in the Stanford Gym I
Friday night. Approximately 200 '
j spectators were on hand.
The Spartans, Northern California j
Junior AAU champs and unbeaten |
so far this year, came out on top, i
20-13, but won 10 points because of
forfeits. Stanford had to concede the
j 123- and 130-pound classes because
: of injuries, and a victory in either
I would have meant the match.
The Cards got their only pin in
i the varsity match when George
Russell, wrestling in the 137-pound
j class, pinned John Jackson of San
| Joie State. It was surprising be
cause Russell had been out all sea
son with injuries and this was his
I first varsity contest . The pin came
! in nine minutes and six seconds.
Pat Madden, Stanford's unbeaten
| freshman sensation, also turned in
| an inspired performance as he won
| a decision from Jim Van Houten,
San Jose's rugged light - heavy
weight. Madden, only a 167-pound
er, wrestled above his class because
Jack Ogelsby, the regular light -
heavy, was out with a cold.
In other matches, Phil Wilon,
Stanford's heavyweight, battle d
Jean Snyder to a draw. Although
standing the same height, Snyder

! outweighed Wilson 215 to 204.
Frank Waxham, wrestling in the
167-pound class for the Spartans,
pinned Bruce Bailey of Stanford in
; 1:39. Bailey had filled in for Mad
j den. San Jose forfeited the 157-
pound division, and in the 147-
I pound class John Melendez, North
j ern California AAU champ, pinned
| Stanford's Bob Jessen in 1:52.
The junior varsity match ended
I in a 10-8 victory for the Cards.
Norm Manoogian, Stanford's heavy
weight, pinned Hal Bristow and Ted
Zsutty, 157 pinned Bill Eckert of
the Spartans. Manoogian's pin came
in 1:35 and Zsutty's in 8:01. Manoo
gian, in his first inter-school match,
looked particularly impressive as he
handled his man with ridiculous j
ease.
In other JV matches, Jim Eliot,
San Jose's light-heavy, pinned A 1
Colton in 14 seconds, and Boyd
Porch, 167, won from Stanford's Bob
Beatty on a decision.
