# Blood Donors, Excuse Plan Among Health Com Jobs
## 
### BARNEY GLASER 
Since the beginning of the school year, Stanford students have
witnessed an over-subscribed Campus Blood Donor Drive, the
elimination of statement of illness certificates, and the establish
ment of a Stanford Blood Bank Account, all of which are due to the
efforts of the Student Health Committee.
The Student Health Committee was established in the fall of

1948 by Excom upon the request of
Dr. George C. Houck, Director of
the Student Health Service. He
went to the ASSU president and
atiked for a student committee to
act as a liaison between the Health
Service and the student body in
order to co-ordinate both their af
fairs.
The need for this committee be
'camc apparent to Dr. Houck when
the students still only trickled in
"after he reorganized the Health
Service from separate men's and
women's clinics, at the same time
'securing a larger and more ade
quate staff.
In the second year of its existence
Ihe Student Health Committee
started a plan for a new infirmary
•which would combine both rest
homes with the Health Service.
Now the plans have been drawn up
and the land obtained; the only
thing needed is the money.
In the 1950-51 school year the
committee started branching out
in its functions. It sponsored the
• free typhoid and tetanus shots
given to all students desiring
them last spring quarter. This
was their most successful project
and was in line with the Civil De
fense program at the time. Ap
proximately 1,206 students were
" immunized.
A lesser project of that year was
starting the ball rolling on getting
better lights for the upstairs library.
Research is being done now as to
the best changes to be made in put
ting in the new fixtures.
The Student Health Commit
tee's first successful major project
this year, in addition to its rou
tine accomplishments, was the
Fall Blood Drive. With the help
of Alpha Phi Omega the quota
was exceeded in the one day set
aside for the drive. A two-day
campaign has been planned for
this spring.
The first week of this quarter
saw the elimination of the statement
of illness certificates. The plan wili
be put on trial for one school year
by the Academic Council. This also
helps to reduce the long lines at the
Health Service, and thus increases
its efficiency.
Another achievement this quar
ter was the establishment of a
Blood Bank Account, which is
available to all people connected
with the Farm and their depend

ents. It can be used any place in
the United States.
The Student Health Committee is
composed of a minimum of seven
and a maximum of nine students.
New people are chosen at the start
of every school year. The members
are mostly pre-med students. They
meet every Tuesday at 5 p.m. in
Dr. Houck's office in the Health
Service. Any student, who wishes
to attend a meeting, is always wel
come.
The members this year are Pete
Halle, chairman, Loran Chandler,
Bill Hindle, Bill Tocher, Forrest
Riordan, Joyce Day, Phil Dolph, and
Eugenia Wolsk.
