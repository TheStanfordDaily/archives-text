SLOW GOING—As Californians cleared away storm damage,
Chicago motorists wallowed along Lake Shore Drive. Strong
easterly winds had driven a generous share of Lake Michigan
over the seawall, and in places the drive was flooded as much
as four feet deep. The storm was expected to bring new lake
front damages as waves pounded areas v/here buildings lined
the shore. —ACME Telephoto
