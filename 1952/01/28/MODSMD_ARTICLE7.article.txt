The Honor Code Committee's comprehensive qucstionaire survey on
the Honor Code's effectiveness has been distributed to all living groups
and will be collected Wednesday,, committee chairman Bernie Tokarz
announced yesterday.
All students are heing asked to answer the questions. The survey is
an attempt to find out areas where the code needs strengthening and to
determine students' knowledge of (he rode and violation procedure.
It will ask such questions as: "How well Ho you think the Honor Code
is working at Stanford? Has the Honor Code been explained clearly to
you Have you ever observed an Honor Code violation? In your opinion,
does cheating occur more frequently on take home tests?" and others.
The eurvey, unlike recent polls at UCLA and other schools, is not
an attempt to determine "how much cheating" goes on here. Results of

Women's Club House, Engineering Corner, and on the Outer Quad be
tween the Business School and Law School, where students can obtain
questionaires.
Should the need of fundamental changes in (he code lie revealed
in (he poll, the Honor Code Committee would make recommendations
to Excem, and issues would be brought before the student body in the
form of a referendum at spring election time, Tokarz said.
He urged students to consider the questions carefully and stressed
the importance of valid results. "I am sure students will realize the im
portance of accuracy in the poll and consider the best interests of Stan
ford and future students, when answering the questions," he said.
Tad Deal is in charge of the survey committee.
