Dean and Mrs. Cubberley's gifts
to the University totaled more than
$772,000. This includes library and
fellowship funds, in addition to the
cost of the Education Building.
After Dean Cubberley's death in
1941, Mrs. Cubberley turned the
home they had built on San Juan
Hill into a residence, for graduate
women. Last year the name of the
residence was changed from Hill
top House to Cubberley House.
Mrs. Cubberley came to Stanford
in 1898 when her husband became
dean of the School of Education.
She was graduated from the Uni
versity in 1900 with Phi Beta Kappa
honors. A member of Kappa Alpha
Theta and an honorary member of
Phi Lambda Theta and Cap and
Gown, Mrs. Cubberley was active in
organizing the Stanford Dames and
for 17 years was executive secretary
of the Stanford Women's Clubhouse.
She co - operated with her late

husband on his educatioanl writ
ings. Her hobbies were genealogy
and gardening and friends reported
that, before her recent illness, on
nice- mornings she could be found
working in the Cubberley 4 House
garden.
"We all just loved her,'' com
mented one of the graduate women
who lived with her. She had en
tertained extensively during her
half-century at, Stanford and before
she fell ill was still receiving daily
calls from alumni and her many
other friends.
Mrs. Cubberley is survived by a
sister, Mrs. Halbert W. Chappel of
Palos Verdes.
