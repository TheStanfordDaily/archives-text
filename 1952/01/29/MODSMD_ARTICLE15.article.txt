# Playmate Tells How Youngster Fell in Creek
## 
### 
A six-year-old tike wandered along the hank overlooking swirl
ing San Francisquito Creek yesterday and falteringly told how his
school-chum Clark H. "Spooky" Sphar stepped into the storm
swollen current "and rolled over and over until he disappeared
around a turn" last Friday.
With head bowed and hands pushed deep into his pockets, the

sad-faced, youngster recalled how he
and young Sphar were racing along
the river bank when suddenly
"Spooky" veered into the stream and
was swept flown.
"He went into the water to get
his feet wet," llie child explained.
"He ' creamed a little, and then we
didn't hear him call anymore. He
went up and down it) the wafer
and then went around the liend.
As the child shuffled along the
hank, he fell silent as he watched
the men in torrent.-tossed boats comb
the stream's 8 to 20 foot depths.
Then grimly he told how Spooky
"had c<inr woosh" into the current
and how all the men had come and
tried to retrieve the body."
"I hope they find him," the quiet
little fellow whispered.
Also hoping to recover Spooky's
body is Sheri/T Earl B. Whitmore of
San Mateo County who reported late
last night that no sign of the creek
victim has been found.
"We'll continue the search until
the little guy is located," the .sheriff
added.

♦
Yesterday boat and amphibious
jeep workers prober! the creek from
the point a mile above El Camino
Peal where the boy fell, to the mouth
of the stream, three and a half miles
j distant.
Though the level of (lie stream
has dropped four feet since Friday,
the current still hampered the
search and halted operations yes
terday when one of the water-jeeps
was flipped over and Sheriff Whit
more was toppled info the current.
It was Wliitmm-e's second dunking
I in two days.
More than ISO mrn are still search
ing for six-year-old Sphar, who was
gulped into the racing stream late
Friday afternoon. At the height of
the search Friday night and Satur
day more than .'>oo men participated
in the giant search including scores !
I of volunteer Stanford students.
Stanford firemen also participat
ed in the search, and Campus Fire
Chief John Marsten led the opera
tion from the west hank of the I
creek through Saturday night.
J Searchers are convinced that the |


boy's body wouldn't have swept more
than 1,500 feet along tho wntcrway
which Spooky's little friend described
hesitantly as being "brown and fast
and ugly looking."

SEARCH CONTINUES — Members of the party searching for the
body of little Spooky Sphar continued their hunt yesterday.
Dozens of people lined San Francisquito Creek in watchful wait.
