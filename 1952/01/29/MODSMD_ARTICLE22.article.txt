When the Alpha Phi Omega Book
Exchange closed its books for the
quarter last Saturday, only $24 and
11 books were unclaimed, out of
the $544 and 465 books which passed
through the Exchange.
This information was revealed
yesterday by Wavne Fuller, who
headed the A Phi O service project
in its opening quarter. Fuller also
said that even counting the un
claimed funds, A Phi O lost approx
imately $5 on the project.
"However," said the Exchange
chairman, "the value that the stu
dents received cannot be ascer
tained, so it is difficult to estimate
the real value of the project in
money terms." Fuller iaid that the
A Phi O debt was due to initial ex
penses on contracts, posters, and
other rentals.
The service fraternity, he ex
plained, was quite satisfied with th*>
results of the project. Because of
the good student reception, A Phi O
plans to carry on the project per
manently. opening at the beginning
of each quarter.
