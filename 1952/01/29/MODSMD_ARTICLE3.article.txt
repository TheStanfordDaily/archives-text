# Thousands Flee Floods
## 
### 
MARIETTA, O.â€”Ever-rising flood
waters rolled relentlessly through
scores of cities and towns in five
states today leaving seven dead and
at least 8,000 persons homeless.
Ohio Valley lowlands from Pitts
burgh on the north to Evansville,
Ind., on the southwest were cov
ered in a sea of mud - yellowed
flood waters from the Ohio River
and its rampaging tributaries. An
estimated 1,000,000 acres of some
of the nation's richest farm lands
were inundated.
Property damage in western
Pennsylvania, western West Vir
ginia, southern and southeastern
Ohio, northern Kentucky, and
southern Indiana was certain to run
into millions of dollars.
