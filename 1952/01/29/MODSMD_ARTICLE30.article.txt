# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN HALL 
(Editor's note: The Daily continues its series of
re-prints from old and classic Lull sessions today.
I ete Grothe and Dick McLean chose the following
column from the Jan. 27, 1950 Daily as repiesenta
tive of John Hail's work. Hall was sports editor,
night editor, hull sessioner and all-around tough
guy with the typewriter for The Dady. He is now
assistant sport editor of the Hollywood Citizen-
News.)
Here I was blabbing my typewriter mouth the other
day that there were no more straight men left in the
world.
All the time I had forgotten about Stanford's stu
dent leading Executive Committee, which met Wed
nesday night—as usual—in the same old Ex com room.
I also caielessly overlooked the Managing Editor
of The Daily, who got so excited at what went on
in the room and consequently played it so straight
that he wrote an article about the meeting, men
tioned his own name two times, and then added a
byline.
The story was front page and screamed at the
public — you the people — "VILLAGE VOTING
BOOTH REOPENED With all that pageantry show
ing, I figured that before I asked who was running
for what, I'd better investigate.
It all started, according to The Daily, when a
5-foot, 5-inch crusader named Jerry Hill burst
onto the scene with a petition signed by 130 other
crusaders demanding the reopening of the polls at
the Village.
' The Village booth was opened 40 minutes late,"
cried Hill. "Approximately 50 students didn't get to
vote."
"My God," I thought to myself. "What is student
government at Stanford coming to? It sounds as if
that deadly and vicious evil—Village Discrimination
—is rearing its ugly head once more."
Naturally, something had to be done. Here was a
petition with 130 signatures. The public had spoken.
But, "NO," said Thurber. "It's unconstitutional."
(That's really a corny line.)
"That's right," said Secretary Ann Mitchell, "Not

enough signatures. The petition S:; invalid; it has
to includf !> percent of the student body and three
dogs." (It used to befoui, but they recently carted
Louie the Boxer up the liver because he knocked
down a little girl to gH her candy such a little
thing.) "And besides, 1 can't t*-!l whethei Hill is a
student or a dog." (/% 11 of this isn't directly quoted,
but 1 was reading between the lines )
"Sure," agreed an unidentified professor. "Such
action would never be allowed, even by Broderitk
Crawford."
Here was crisis. Stark, real, critical crisis. The
issue was in doubt. There weie two sides.
"Wait-wait," said President. Hank, the people's
choice. "By gum, Excom said the rolls would be open
at the time stated, and Excom will ' tick by its guns."
Hoorays and huz/alis rumbled around the room.
"Yeah, Hank," "Attaboy," "You tell 'em, Hank us."
Suddenly h pin was dropped and Lurry Hoff
jumped to his leel a-, il you know very well if.
Hoff, one of the top 410 men on Hie Coast the
Karl Kraushaar heckhr in il.« bu-.iness, and a good
guy, spoke: "Even though the poll-, were late in
opening at the Village, the •,Indents who weie unable
to vote could have voted latei at the Village, or on
campus if they had come to class."
"My God," someone must have said. "HofTs right.
How could it have been ovei looked Everybody knows
that people in the Village go to Stanford ioo.'
"Hooray, Larry." A 10-minute demonstration fol
lowed.
"But, up shot Hank again. "No-no, we promised,"
said Hank.
"But, Hank."
"No-no."
"Oh, okay, Hank—VILLAGE VOTING EOOTIIS
REOPENED."
Quite a story, huh? By the way, WHO was run
ning for WHAT, why i i > the Village •.<» t-xcited, ami
as a matter of fact, who the hell cares?
Excom seems to be batting its head against a stone
wall—and maybe it'll be good for 'em.
At any rate, 1 finally found me some straight men.
