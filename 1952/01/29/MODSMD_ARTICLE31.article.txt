## Some Thoughts on Censorship 
### 
To the Editor:
I am indeed glad to see that The Stanford Daily
has taken a firm stand in opposition to censorship
of the Daily Californion. It is gratifying to see that
this paper alone had the fortitude to adopt such a
position, especially after some "unmentionable" San
Francisco newspapers have refused to do this.
It is good to notice the paper's consistency regard
ing censorship of a student run publication—both in
the Chaparral case last year and in the present in
cident of the Daily Californian.
It is unique to iiOtice an editor of a paper agreeing

with the idea that the publisher-owner has no right
to censor objectionable material—objectionable to that
publisher-owner or his representatives.
It is especially noble of you to do this when one
realizes that, by taking this stand, you may in the
future be in the same position as the other unfortunate
paper.
I am happy to see that you agree that freedom of
the press is something that should be defined by the
press, for in doing so you must also say that freedom
from want should be defined by the beggars.
