### HOLBROOK TETER 
(Editor's note: Hclbrook Teter, Daily night edi
tor, writes of his experiences in Greece and Turkey
today. Teter and two companions travelled 20,000
miles completely around the Mediterranean Sea
last summer in a four-cylinder Renault. Another
Teter story will be published soon.)

In Greece wo swam, ate food drenched with olive
oil, drank camphorous raisin wins, and nearly died
of the heat. We visited the magnificant and pitiful
ruins which stud the hills and mountains of this
rugged land—Delphi, Corinth, Sparta, Mycenae, and
others. And stood in awe before Athens' Acropolis —
so much heralded, to incapable of praise.
The Greeks were very friendly to us, and trusting.
We met a surprising number of naturalized Ameri
££.ll citizens who had returned for a visit or to live
again in Greece. They were so proud that they were
American;: and wanted to tell us about the years they
had spent in Chicago or San Francisco.
People everywhere stopped us to ask, in English,
what we wanted, or if they could help us (since
we were generally lost or having a hard lime inak -
ing ourselves understood).
American prestige again seemed very high. We
met a Greek army officer who told us that the United
States v/as very popular and that the Greek people
were very thankful. But, he saiiij if it were not for
America, Greece v/ould make war on Albania (over
the difficult minority problems). He was a proud and
patriotic Greek and he told us that the Greek nation
is ready to fight everywhere for liberty. Fifty thou
sand Greeks volunteered to go to Korea, lie said, but
the American embassy would take only 5,000.
We missed the boat that was to take us from
Athens, through the Dardanelles, to Istanbul. Since
the next boat would not leave until two weeks later,
we had to drive hack to Salonika and across Greek
Macedonia and Thrace to Turkey. The roads here,
as in most of Yugoslavia, were in very poor con
dition—unpaved, rocky, and studded with holes.
Where destroyed bridges had not yet been repaired,

we had to diive down the banks of the stream and
cross through the water.
One night, as we were driving north somewhere
near the Turkish border, a group of men waved us
to stop. We decided it wasn't a wise idea, and didn't
slow down. One of them jumped in front of our ear
and, spotlighted by our headlights, leveled his rifle
at us. We stopped.
There were about 20 men, all carrying rifles and
wearing well-stocked cartridge belt:. We produced
our passports and alter a .short discussion they let
us go. We were stopped several other times that
evening, and knew enough to comply immediately.
We linallv reached Ttirkev, after getting Just and
nearly visiting Bulgaria instead. Jhe three of us
were surprised and fascinated by Istanbul the
cosmopolitan handsomene•••, of the new city, the
color, the splendor, and the squalor of the ohl city —
outlined by the sun mid bordered by the blue
waters of the Bosphorus.
We admired the Turkish people very much. They
seemed vigorous and spoiive, straight-forward and
jolly. Their mosques are lovely, their cities full of
life, and their country poor. Their poverty is the
link which binds the tranquil humility and spacious
ness of the mosques lo the crowded sensuality ol the
bazaars.
In Ankara we heard some critic i: m of American aid.
A young university professor who had studied at Cal,
told us that the present djy emphasis on mechani
zation in Turkey was completely mi.placed. Turkey
doesn't need, can't use machines on farms, he said.
Both Turkey jo 1 the United States are at fault. II?
also told us that he wasn't convinced of American
sincerity from the type of men who are sent over.
Another man told us that the United StatPS shouldn't
have relied on the Turkish government for advice
concerning aid.
In southern Turkey we met several Americans
who were vvoiking on a big air-base near Adana.
They thought we were crazy to make a trip in a
Renault. "You're not travelling," one of them said
to us, "you're suffering."
