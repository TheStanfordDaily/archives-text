Providing an opportunity for pro
moting understanding among races
and furthering democracy, the
American Friends Service Com
mittee is planning another of its se
ries of weekend work camps this
Friday and Saturday.
At these camps high school, col
lege students, and young adults from
the Bay Area meet at the Commit
tee's headquarters on Friday eve
ning. Following Saturday break
last, the day's project is outlined.
Some weekends they may help to
paint a church, on others arrange
an all-day outing fur a family which
otherwise would not have been able
to get away. By these arrangements
some of the ideals of social service
are put into concrete details.
Students interested in this type
