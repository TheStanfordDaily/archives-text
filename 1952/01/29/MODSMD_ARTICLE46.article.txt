## Punts and Pitches

Bob Burnett wore a smile Satur
day night. Stanford had just lost to
the Stewart Chevrolets, 68 to 63, but
still Bob Burnett wore a smile.
Said the Indian headman, "I
thought we played our best ball of
the year tonight. The boys were
playing smart, hustling, aggressive
ball, and it was no disgrace to lose
to the Stewarts. The fact that they
were AAU champs last year means
that they are no hamburger outfit.
I liked the work of our reserves,
Bruce Iversen, Gary Andrews, and
Don Delong."
Yesterday we talked to trainer
Connie Jar vis, lie of the L ;v tie
and black kit. Connie has seen
more than a few Indian cage tilts,
and he opined, "Technically
speaking', I can't remember a
Stanfu r d team playing more
sound ball since we heat Yale
with Tony Lavelli three years
ago."
It should be noted that Burnett is
not over-lavish with praise for his
team, and that when he does com
pliment the squad, it is more than
empty words.
In short, the Stanford team was
GOOD last Saturday. Unlike pre
vious tilts, they were not erratic.
'1 he shift of Walsh from guard to
forward helps on the backboards,
and he looked a lot more steady
last week. Tomsic injured his ankle
but will be back for the San Jose
State tilt. Iversen, who has been
looking sharp lately, will start for
the Fremont freshmen.
The word is to get your tickets
early for the Oilers' game. They
are probably the most bruising

team in basketball . . . something
like the Trojans. Bob Kurland,
the center, is seven feet tall, Bus
Whitehead is 6-9, Bill Kleine 6-10,
and Bob Pierce is a midget at 6-7.
An under-sized fish who should
be thrown back in the ocean.
Look for the Indians to wallop
SJS tomorrow night and then to get
licked by the Phillips. Then wait
for the conference race to begin on
the 15th of February, and watch the
Indians go.

We were scrambling through
some notes yesterday when we fell
upon our all - star football team
which we failed to print earlier.
This is no ordinary football team.
This is a Stanford all - opponent
jawbreaker team. Jawbreaker
means hard to pronounce. It's a
squad calculated to make stuttering
maniacs out of the most articulate
speech and drama professors:
End—Jack Witzelberger (SJS)
End—Raymond PoznekofT (SJS)
Tackle — Charles Fraychineaud
(UCLA)
Tackle—Donald Zarosinski (OSC)
Guard —Iheo d or e 1101/kneclil
(Wash)
Guard—Gene Jaghnvski (WSC)
Center—Don Gnitfovic (HI.)
Quarterback — Lynn Apla n a 1 p

Bob Burnett wore a smile Satur
day night. Stanford had just lost to
the Stewart Chevrolets, 68 to 63, but
still Bob Burnett wore a smile.
Said the Indian headman, "I
thought we played our best ball of
the year tonight. The boys were
playing smart, hustling, aggressive
ball, and it was no disgrace to lose
to the Stewarts. The fact that they
were AAU champs last year means
that they are no hamburger outfit.
I liked the work of our reserves,
Bruce Iversen, Gary Andrews, and
Don Delong."
Yesterday we talked to trainer
Connie Jar vis, lie of the L ;v tie
and black kit. Connie has seen
more than a few Indian cage tilts,
and he opined, "Technically
speaking', I can't remember a
Stanfu r d team playing more
sound ball since we heat Yale
with Tony Lavelli three years
ago."
It should be noted that Burnett is
not over-lavish with praise for his
team, and that when he does com
pliment the squad, it is more than
empty words.
In short, the Stanford team was
GOOD last Saturday. Unlike pre
vious tilts, they were not erratic.
'1 he shift of Walsh from guard to
forward helps on the backboards,
and he looked a lot more steady
last week. Tomsic injured his ankle
but will be back for the San Jose
State tilt. Iversen, who has been
looking sharp lately, will start for
the Fremont freshmen.
The word is to get your tickets
early for the Oilers' game. They
are probably the most bruising

team in basketball . . . something
like the Trojans. Bob Kurland,
the center, is seven feet tall, Bus
Whitehead is 6-9, Bill Kleine 6-10,
and Bob Pierce is a midget at 6-7.
An under-sized fish who should
be thrown back in the ocean.
Look for the Indians to wallop
SJS tomorrow night and then to get
licked by the Phillips. Then wait
for the conference race to begin on
the 15th of February, and watch the
Indians go.

We were scrambling through
some notes yesterday when we fell
upon our all - star football team
which we failed to print earlier.
This is no ordinary football team.
This is a Stanford all - opponent
jawbreaker team. Jawbreaker
means hard to pronounce. It's a
squad calculated to make stuttering
maniacs out of the most articulate
speech and drama professors:
End—Jack Witzelberger (SJS)
End—Raymond PoznekofT (SJS)
Tackle — Charles Fraychineaud
(UCLA)
Tackle—Donald Zarosinski (OSC)
Guard —Iheo d or e 1101/kneclil

Center—Don Gnitfovic (HI.)
Quarterback — Lynn Apla n a 1 p
