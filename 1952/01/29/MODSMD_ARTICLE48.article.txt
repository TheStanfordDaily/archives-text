by sharp-eyed center Carlos Bea,
trounced the Phi Delts, 40-32, in a
mural game played last night. Bea
scored 20 points to lead both teams
in scoring.
The Delts j were never in
trouble, the eight-point final mar
gin being the smallest in the sec
ond lialg. During the first period
Bea tanked six field goals to give
the winners a 19-12 half - time
lead. As the second half opened.
Bea and forward Estehan Mitchell
teamed to give the Delts a com
fortable 27-14 lead.
The Phi Delts then attempted to
tie the score. Two free throws by
Jim Auble, a field goal by Gary
Gray, and a pair of two-pointers
by center Bob Mace brought the
losers up to a 32-22 deficit. The
come-back was short-lived, how
ever, as another bucket by Bea and
two points by Bob Barley gave the
Delts another commanding lead.
Out-tanding for the winners were
Bea, who starred for Menlo JC and
plays with YMI in his spare time;
Mitchell; and guard Dick Weisman,
who on several occasions stole the
ball from opponents' hands. For the
Phi Delts, Mace led the scoring,

The Delt I basketball team, led
by sharp-eyed center Carlos Bea,
trounced the Phi Delts, 40-32, in a
mural game played last night. Bea
scored 20 points to lead both teams
in scoring.
The Delts j were never in
trouble, the eight-point final mar
gin being the smallest in the sec
ond lialg. During the first period
Bea tanked six field goals to give
the winners a 19-12 half - time
lead. As the second half opened.
Bea and forward Estehan Mitchell
teamed to give the Delts a com
fortable 27-14 lead.
The Phi Delts then attempted to
tie the score. Two free throws by
Jim Auble, a field goal by Gary
Gray, and a pair of two-pointers
by center Bob Mace brought the
losers up to a 32-22 deficit. The
come-back was short-lived, how
ever, as another bucket by Bea and
two points by Bob Barley gave the
Delts another commanding lead.
Out-tanding for the winners were
Bea, who starred for Menlo JC and
plays with YMI in his spare time;
Mitchell; and guard Dick Weisman,
who on several occasions stole the
ball from opponents' hands. For the
Phi Delts, Mace led the scoring,
tallying 16 times. Runner-up in
the scoring was Mitchell with nine
points.
