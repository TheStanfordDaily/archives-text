# Con Home Kids Get Monthly Entertainment
## 
### JIM MADISON 
Last l'riday afternoon the kids at the Con Home were once again
reminded that they are not forgotten by Stanford during the long
months between the yearly Con Home Drives.
t The occasion was the regular monthly visit of a show produced
.by the Con Home Entertainment Committee, a project started last

year by Fre Chez, now chairman of
,'Co-Rec.
Friday Bob Smith's Lnciua Jazz
Band headlined the show, perform
ing two numbers. During one of
.them Gordon Johnson and Cherrie
Coffee danced a Charleston for the
.kids.
Magic Show
; Also on the program were Tom
Lewyn and Marv Melton, who staged
}a fascinating magic show. Emcee of
the day was Steve Blumberg, who
with Beth Sieroty has taken over
jthe chairmanship of the committee.
Blumberg arid Miss Sieroty led the
;kids in some peppy community sing
ing.
The group put on two twenty-min
ute shows for the young patients,
'one for the bedridden and another
for those wlio were ambulatory.
jDuring each the kids responded and
Jet loose as much as their condition
permitted.
• Then at the close of each perform
ance, the Stanford students distrib
uted gifts of chocolate bars furnished
by the Cellar Store to each of the
kids.
Started Last Winter
It was in last winter quarter that
Chez first conceived the idea of the
Entertainment Com. One day he
took a ride out to the Home. "I
don't know why, just sort of to look
the place over," he remembers.

He found the kids treated well,
hut the thought occurred to him that
they would appreciate some form of
outside entertainment that would
permit them to relax in uninhibited
fun. He talked his idea over with
the Director and found her encour
aging.
So . . . He worked out a program
on his own and presented it to Excom
along with a request for the small
amount, of money neccssary for hard
candy and such that he wanted to
distribute.
The plan was ok'd and out Fred
trekked to the Home with a group
of volunteer entertainers prepared to
tell stories, lead community singing,
and perform vaudeville acts.
Enthusiasm only Criticism
The kids relished the show, the
people who staged it got a real thrill
out of making the kids happy, and
the only criticism came from the
Con Home administration who
thought that perhaps the kids got
too enthusiastic for the nature of
their convalescence.
After the success was demon
strated, Excom set up the ASSU Con
Home Entertainment Committee,
whose function was to carry on the
program on a monthly basis. Fred
became the first chairman.
This fall quarter Chez took over
the reins of Co-Rec, so he stepped

out the leadership of the Con Home
Com. Barbara Lafot became the new
chairman. Then at the beginning of
winter quarter, Blumberg and Miss
Sieroty were appointed the present
co-chairmen.
Musicians Entertain
The list of entertainers has in
cluded such Farm musicians as Tex
Thompson and Scotty Doggett and
also many other Farm students who
have no special talent, for the com
mittee finds that good mixers are as
much in demand as vaudeville acts.
Since all the performers are vol
unteers, and the committee likes to
vary the shows from month to

month, Blumberg asks anyone who
would like to participate in a future
heart-warming afternoon to contact
either him at Encina, v/here he is a
sponsor, or Miss Sieroty at Lag.


FUNTIME AT THE CON HOME—During a recent program at the
Con Home, Mary Hanf tells the kids an acted-out story, while
Fred Chez, originator of the Entertainment Com, encourages her
in his emcee's costume.

candy and such that he wanted to
distribute.
The plan was ok'd and out Fred
trekked to the Home with a group
of volunteer entertainers prepared to
tell stories, lead community singing,
and perform vaudeville acts.
Enthusiasm only Criticism
The kids relished the show, the
people who staged it got a real thrill
out of making the kids happy, and
the only criticism came from the
Con Home administration who
thought that perhaps the kids got
too enthusiastic for the nature of
their convalescence.
After the success was demon
strated, Excom set up the ASSU Con
Home Entertainment Committee,
whose function was to carry on the
program on a monthly basis. Fred
became the first chairman.
This fall quarter Chez took over
the reins of Co-Rec, so he stepped

out the leadership of the Con Home
Com. Barbara Lafot became the new
chairman. Then at the beginning of
winter quarter, Blumberg and Miss
Sieroty were appointed the present
co-chairmen.
Musicians Entertain
The list of entertainers has in
cluded such Farm musicians as Tex
Thompson and Scotty Doggett and
also many other Farm students who
have no special talent, for the com
mittee finds that good mixers are as
much in demand as vaudeville acts.
Since all the performers are vol
unteers, and the committee likes to
vary the shows from month to

month, Blumberg asks anyone who
would like to participate in a future
heart-warming afternoon to contact
either him at Encina, v/here he is a
sponsor, or Miss Sieroty at Lag.


FUNTIME AT THE CON HOME—During a recent program at the
Con Home, Mary Hanf tells the kids an acted-out story, while
Fred Chez, originator of the Entertainment Com, encourages her
in his emcee's costume.
Last l'riday afternoon the kids at the Con Home were once again
reminded that they are not forgotten by Stanford during the long
months between the yearly Con Home Drives.
t The occasion was the regular monthly visit of a show produced
.by the Con Home Entertainment Committee, a project started last

year by Fre Chez, now chairman of
,'Co-Rec.
Friday Bob Smith's Lnciua Jazz
Band headlined the show, perform
ing two numbers. During one of
.them Gordon Johnson and Cherrie
Coffee danced a Charleston for the
.kids.
Magic Show
; Also on the program were Tom
Lewyn and Marv Melton, who staged
}a fascinating magic show. Emcee of
the day was Steve Blumberg, who
with Beth Sieroty has taken over
jthe chairmanship of the committee.
Blumberg arid Miss Sieroty led the
;kids in some peppy community sing
ing.
The group put on two twenty-min
ute shows for the young patients,
'one for the bedridden and another
for those wlio were ambulatory.
jDuring each the kids responded and
Jet loose as much as their condition
permitted.
• Then at the close of each perform
ance, the Stanford students distrib
uted gifts of chocolate bars furnished
by the Cellar Store to each of the
kids.
Started Last Winter
It was in last winter quarter that
Chez first conceived the idea of the
Entertainment Com. One day he
took a ride out to the Home. "I
don't know why, just sort of to look
the place over," he remembers.

He found the kids treated well,
hut the thought occurred to him that
they would appreciate some form of
outside entertainment that would
permit them to relax in uninhibited
fun. He talked his idea over with
the Director and found her encour
aging.
So . . . He worked out a program
on his own and presented it to Excom
along with a request for the small
amount, of money neccssary for hard
candy and such that he wanted to
distribute.
