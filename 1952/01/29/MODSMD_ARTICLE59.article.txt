No one wants it!
The '51 Ford of Bucky Byrne,
Stern Hall senior, stolen from his
home in San Francisco on Jan. 3,
was found by police this weekend
stripped and abandoned on a side
street near Byrne's home.
The thieves took the ra'-'io,
clock, cigarette lighter, spare tire,
a desk lamp, overcoat, tennis
racket, screwdriver, and three
maps of Southern California.
They left the owner only one
thin;*: his Rose Bowl program.
