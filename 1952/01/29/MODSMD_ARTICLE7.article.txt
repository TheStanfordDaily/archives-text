### 
LONDON. Jan. 23 (UP)—Prime
Minister Winston Churchill re
turned to London today for urgent
conferences on the Egyptian crisis
as Britain adopted an optimistic
"wait and see" attitude toward the
new Egyptian government of Pre
mier Aly Maher Pasha.
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden,

who held a cabinet session earlier
today with Britain's military chiefs
in attendance, met Churchill.
The Prime Minister and his cabi
net face the problem of deciding
now whether to make a fresh at
tempt at negotiating a settlement of
the Anglo-Egyptian dispute with
the new independent Egyptian gov
ernment which replaced the Na
tionalist Wafd regime of former
Premier Mustapha El Nahas Pasha.
