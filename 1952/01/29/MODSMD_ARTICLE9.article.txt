ent to speak and to personally

a young movie producer and lectur
er who has traveled and skied all

States. His opening remarks tomor

cents a day.
Film Considered Tops
The film itself has been played
to 35 packed houses in the United
States. Johnny Litchfield, former
head of the Sun Valley Ski School
and now captain of the Tenth
Mountain Division of tho ski troops,
called it the finest ski film he has
ever seen. It is not, however, pri
marily directed to skiers.
Of special interest to Stanford
students are pictures of ski spots in
California including Squaw Valley,

Yosemite, and Donner Pass.
In the second half of the film the
Olympic tryouts and the Harriman
Cup races will be shown. In this
part there are pictures of all the
stars who are now in Oslo for this
year's Olympics; there are pictures
of Brynhilde Grarmoen of the 1948
at Stanford; there are the Ihl.l pic
at Stanford; thre are the last pic
tures ever taken of Jimmy Griffith,
the young skier who was killed at
Alta this year.
One of the most unusual scenes
was taken at the Pomona County
Fair last September when Olympic
stars tried out on an artificial jump
in 104 of California heat.
The tickets for the movie cost $1
each and may bo obtained from the
Stanford Ski Shop on El Camino,
Smith's- on-lhe-Circle, Joan Benny
at Roble, Sam Grossman at Encina,

Film Considered Tops
The film itself has been played
to 35 packed houses in the United
States. Johnny Litchfield, former
head of the Sun Valley Ski School
and now captain of the Tenth
Mountain Division of tho ski troops,
called it the finest ski film he has
ever seen. It is not, however, pri
marily directed to skiers.
Of special interest to Stanford
students are pictures of ski spots in
California including Squaw Valley,

Yosemite, and Donner Pass.
