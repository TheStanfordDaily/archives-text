### 
The Stanford Players will open
tonight in the Little Theater for a
four-day run of "The Good Woman
of Setzuan" by Bertolt Brecht, a
contemporary German writer.
The play is a decisive break from
the usual modern form of realism.
Brecht's technique, called "Epic
Theater," makes extensive use of

from Nazi domination during the
war years.
"The design problem, both visu
ally and mechanically backstage,"
song, verse, pantomime, and address
to the audience. Brecht wrote this
play while in exile in California

according to Hugo Melchione, de
signer, "has been worked out like
a Chinese puzzle." Nancy Langoton,
director, states, "We hope that the
co-ordination of poetry, prose, cho
reography, and realistic settings and
costumes will he a stimulating ex
perience to the audience."
The cast consists of 23 members,
with Janet Karahadian in the title
role and Koss Duriee as her lover.
The ballads were written by Ynez
Lynch and Hazelle Wilson under
the direction of Leonard Ratner.
Tickets are on sale at the Memo
rial Auditorium box oflicc at 50
cents each.
