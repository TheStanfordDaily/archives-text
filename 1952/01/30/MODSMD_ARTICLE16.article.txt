# Taft May Give Decision Today
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2!) (UP)
Son. Robert A. Taft promised today
to announce tomorrow morning
whether he will stay in the New
Hampshire primary for a head-on
clash with Gen. Dwight D. Eisen
hower and Harold E. Stassen for the
Republican Presidential nomination.
Petitions to put Taft and Stassen
into the March 11 race, first in the
nation, were filed today with the
New Hampshire Secretary of State
at Concord.
Taft's name was entered while the
Ohio Senator still was considering
whether to even get into the race.
Notified of the action, Taft said he
will announce his decision tomor
row morning. He could order his
name withdrawn within If) days.
Tomorrow is the deadline for en
tering the primary.
The New Hampshire primary also
presented President Truman with
an eleventh - hour decision on
whether to let his name go in as a
candidate for the Democratic nomi
nation.
James D. McPhail, a Manchester
lumberman, said he will file the
petition to put Mr. Truman's name
on the hallol "if the President ap
proves."
Such approval is unlikely since
Mr. Truman is not yet ready to dis
close whether he will run again. He
recently ordered his name kept out
of the Minnesota March IS primary
and induced Sen. Hubert H. Hum
phrey (D., Minn.) to run as a "fa
vorite son" instead.
Supporters of Sen. Kefau
ver (D., Tenn.), the only avowed
candidate for the Democratic Presi
dential nomination, plan to file his
name for the New Hampshire pri
mary tomorrow.
Democratic National Chairman
Frank E. McKinney said after a talk
with the President today lie still
doesn't know Mr. Truman's plans
but there has been "no indication"
the President is thinking about any
one else for the nomination.
