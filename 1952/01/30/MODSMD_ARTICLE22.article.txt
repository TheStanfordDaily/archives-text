## High Scoring Cagers Vie With SJS 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's high-scoring bas
ketball team will take to the wars
again, this time against San Jose
Stale at 8 p.m. in the Pavilion.
No admission will be charged.
Coach Walter McPherson has so
far led the Spartans to a very suc
cessful season, as they have piled
up 11 victories against four losses.
Since mo t of their games have been
against Bay Area independents, the
Stanford game should prove their
toughest of the seasons.
The Spartans want a win in the
Stanford Pavilion more than any
thing else, and the game should be
fairly exciting. Stanford, on the
other hand, will go into the game
a definite favorite, although the
Cards have lost their last three
games.
They lead the PCC in total points
scored and, in Ramstead, Tucker,
Walsh, and Tomsic, have the four
highest individual scorers in the
leaque. lacker is leading with a
14.8 average and close behind him
are Ramstead (M.7), Tomsic (13.5),
and Walsh (13.3).
Cards high in other departments
are Tomsic and Tucker, who are
numbers one and two respectively
in free-throw percentage; Tomsic,
who is second in field-goal percent
age; and Ramstead, who is the lead
ing rebounder on the Coast.
The Ca'ds as a team are hitting
on .357 per cent of ( their shots from
the floor and .713 on their free
throws. The latter mark is tops in
the conference. Stanford also has
the worst defensive record, how
ever.
Big gun for the Spartans will be
George Clark, their 6-ft. 6-in. cen
ter and one of the classiest pivot
men on the Coast. Clark is cur
rently second behind Ben Gibson in
pendments. He is averaging 16.8
individual scoring among the inde
points per game and is a terror un
der the boards.
Bay Area fans well remember
Clark's outstanding performance
two years ago when mighty Bowl
ing Green invaded the Cow Palace
for a game with the underdog Spar
tans . The Ohioans had, in 6-ft. 11-
in. Charlie Share, the fourth-high
est individual scorer in the country.
