WASHINGTON, Jan. 2!) â€” The
United States soon will urge the
new Egyptian government to join
Britain in immediate negotiations
aimed at ending the bloody Anglo-
Egyptian dispute over the Suez
Canal Zone.
This was disclosed by diplomatic
officials today as British Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden told the
House of Commons that Britain
hopes to reach an agreement which
would provide for adequate defense
of the canal and still meet "Egyp
tian aspirations."
American officials declined to
predict Egypt's reaction.
