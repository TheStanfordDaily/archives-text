# A 						Look at Chronic Problems
## 
### 
Under the heading "chronic problems" a
long-time student at Stanford often groups
many of his pet gripes. Generally chronic prob
lems concern relatively minor ills that are an
noying but not overwhelming.
Like the library lights, for instance. As any-
One who has ventured upstaii'3 in the library
well knows, lighting in the reference room is
bout as effective for reading an a pair of flash
lights are for night driving.
Much thought, some of it haphazard and
some of it intelligent, has gone into the "prob
lem. A comprehensive Daily story last year
told of man/ of the details that face library
officials in their battle for decent lights. Num
ber one detail was always money, with such
bottlenecks as architectural design also in the
picture.
Since the lights are still bad, money is pre
sumably still the missing factor. The student
health committee is working on the problem
and someday, as with most problems, even
tually the money v/ill come and the lights will
go in.

And then there are the roads. Or the holes

in roads, to be specific. The old familiar song
once again. Plans are on hand, workmen are
ready, everyone is for good roads, but there's
no money.
Or take poor meals (but don't forget the good
ones), lack of dormitory space, poor street
lights, inadeguate instruction in "section" class
es (like sections supplementing Economics
classes), or any of the other irritations that could
be cited.

Or if you prefer, look at the bright side of
the picture, or problems which are no longer
problems. Like the registration procedure.
Once an all-day headache, it has been simpli
fied greatly and is smooth compared to most
schools.
Or the bookstore lines, which have improved
tremendously; or the language requirement,
which at least has been changed.
And when you have cornered chronic prob
lems this far, there's not much more to be said.
Except, perhaps, a plea to realize the difiiculties
involved, a plea to understand the roles ol com
mittees and planning groups; and a final plea
to keep right on insisting foi changes.
