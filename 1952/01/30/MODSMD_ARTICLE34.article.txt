sessions soon.)

As a child I wasn't much plagued with that question
at the end of each school day,"And just what did you
learn today?" It seems that the first day my father
asked me, I kicked him in the shins, and since then
his interest in my scholastic achievements has been
very sparse.
Between quarters was a temptation for him. He
set his shins out of reach, kept looking at his paper
and casually asked, "Learning much, son?"
"Just loads, Dad." I continued thumbing through
my little book.
"Don't go reminding him of his studies. He's on
vacation," Mom said. "Son, have you enough socks
at school?"
"Yes, Mom." I ran a lino through the phone num
ber of a girl who had gotten married since I was
last home.
"I'm paying for his education. I'm entitled to some
information," Dad said.
"It's been 25 years since you've been to college.
Things have changed since then. Son, have you got
enough underwear at school?"
"Yes, Morn." I ran a line through another name.
"Tilings haven't changed so much that I can't dis
cuss it with him," Dad said.
"You'll get sentimental and start to sing your old
fraternity songs again. Son, are you getting good
food?"
"Yes, Mom." I drew another line. Those wedding
bells are messing up that old black book of mine.
"The night your old cronies came up, you sang
until two,'" Mom said to Dad. "Son, have you seen
Florence since you've been home?"

"Yes, Mom." 1 put the book away. "Who did you
say?"
"Florence. You know, the Brenton girl. She may
not be as pretty as some of the others, but she can
cook and she sews her own clothes, and Mrs. Bren
ton was saying to me, wouldn't it be nice if—"
"Yeah, Dad," I turned to him. "I've been studying
pretty hard."
"Glad to hear it, son. I wasn't much of one for
studies, but they're good for you."
"Son, you aren't listening to me," M«m said.
"Sure 1 am. Florence is a real nice girl, m :d nice."
"Tell me son, have things changed much?" Dad
asked.
"Science is the big thing now. No more |of this
foolishness about reading and writing. This is the
atomic age." I gave him a harty slap on the back.
"She'll make some lucky boy a good wife," Mom
said.
"Just what courses have you been taking?" Dud
asked.
I searched my memory for a few course names I
had read in the Announcement of Courses, thinking
to kid him along. "Well, there's Geometric Function
Theory and Matrix and Tensor Calculus."
'1 respect them scientists, but sometimes I think
they ought to say things plain-like so a man can
understand them."
"Schools are modern, nowadays," I proudly an
nounced.
"Son, your attitude doesn't please me much. I
think the best thing for both of us would lie for you
to drop out of school and go to work."
"Work?" I said. "Work?" I pulled up a chair and
put my hand on his shoulder. "But, Dad, the impor
tant things you learn aren't in classes, but it's things
like learning to live with your fellow students that
really count." I continued on into the night, ex
plaining to Dad the intangible values (.J college, re
minding him of his college days and singing old songs
v/ith him.

learn today?" It seems that the first day my father
asked me, I kicked him in the shins, and since then
his interest in my scholastic achievements has been
very sparse.
Between quarters was a temptation for him. He
set his shins out of reach, kept looking at his paper
and casually asked, "Learning much, son?"
"Just loads, Dad." I continued thumbing through
my little book.
"Don't go reminding him of his studies. He's on
vacation," Mom said. "Son, have you enough socks
at school?"
"Yes, Mom." I ran a lino through the phone num
ber of a girl who had gotten married since I was
last home.
"I'm paying for his education. I'm entitled to some
information," Dad said.
"It's been 25 years since you've been to college.
Things have changed since then. Son, have you got
enough underwear at school?"
"Yes, Morn." I ran a line through another name.
"Tilings haven't changed so much that I can't dis
cuss it with him," Dad said.
"You'll get sentimental and start to sing your old
fraternity songs again. Son, are you getting good
food?"
"Yes, Mom." I drew another line. Those wedding
bells are messing up that old black book of mine.
"The night your old cronies came up, you sang
until two,'" Mom said to Dad. "Son, have you seen
Florence since you've been home?"

"Yes, Mom." 1 put the book away. "Who did you
say?"
"Florence. You know, the Brenton girl. She may
not be as pretty as some of the others, but she can
cook and she sews her own clothes, and Mrs. Bren
ton was saying to me, wouldn't it be nice if—"
"Yeah, Dad," I turned to him. "I've been studying
pretty hard."
"Glad to hear it, son. I wasn't much of one for
studies, but they're good for you."
"Son, you aren't listening to me," M«m said.
"Sure 1 am. Florence is a real nice girl, m :d nice."
"Tell me son, have things changed much?" Dad
asked.
"Science is the big thing now. No more |of this
foolishness about reading and writing. This is the
atomic age." I gave him a harty slap on the back.
"She'll make some lucky boy a good wife," Mom
said.
"Just what courses have you been taking?" Dud
asked.
I searched my memory for a few course names I
had read in the Announcement of Courses, thinking
to kid him along. "Well, there's Geometric Function
Theory and Matrix and Tensor Calculus."
'1 respect them scientists, but sometimes I think
they ought to say things plain-like so a man can
understand them."
"Schools are modern, nowadays," I proudly an
nounced.
"Son, your attitude doesn't please me much. I
think the best thing for both of us would lie for you
to drop out of school and go to work."
"Work?" I said. "Work?" I pulled up a chair and
put my hand on his shoulder. "But, Dad, the impor
tant things you learn aren't in classes, but it's things
like learning to live with your fellow students that
really count." I continued on into the night, ex
plaining to Dad the intangible values (.J college, re
minding him of his college days and singing old songs
