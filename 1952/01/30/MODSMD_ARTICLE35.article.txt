# LIFE IN PARIS
## foreign Student With Three Degrees Describes Life in French University 
### BARBARA TUERK 
"Americans tend to stress the
differences in the foreign policies of
the Western nations, although ac
tually the similarities are far more
significant."
As examples of the common poli
cies of his nation and ours arrived
at by compromise, Daniel Charbon
nier, ASSU Foreign Scholar from
Paris, cited the present, German
agreements and the Korean and
Indo-Chinese wars.
Dan said that France is more than
willing to follow the leadership of
teh United States, as the most pow
erful of the group of Allies. How
ever, if the present alliance were
disbanded, or if the United States
stopped leading it, France would
once again pursue an independent
foreign policy.
Americans should remember, he
added, that right after the war
French policy did not coincide with
that of the United States, particu
larly on the German issues. Their
acceptance of n united West Ger
many and of German troops in the
European army are outstanding ex
amples of international co-opera
tion.
Many Degrees
Dan, an international relations
major, received degrees in law and
the social sciences and part of a
degree in humanities from the Uni
versity of Paris last year. At the
same time he was working in vari
ous European nations from Sweden
to Egypt.
-ft® learned his idiomatic English
lumbering in England, and when
conversing with a taxi-driver upon
first arriving in New York, was
asked: ' How are things in England
these days?" That was the first—
and last -time that's ever happened
to him.

He explains his three simultane
ous degrees by describing the
French university system. The Uni
versity of Paris permits a student to
register at a nominal fee for as
many courses as he chooses, and
gives a degree to anyone passing the
requisite number of exams.
The catch is that approximately
70 per cent of the students flunk
any given exam. Several of Dan's
friends have been freshmen for .six
or seven years, and one fine exam
ple, a man of 41, has been trying to
attain sophomore status for SO
years.

Itatio Two to One

The ratio of men to women is
about the same at the University of
Paris as here—approximately two
to J but European women suffer
a great disadvantage taking oral ex
ams. The examiners suspect women
students of u r .ing feminine wile*' to

| put something over on them, and
build up a great defensive mecha
nism. They quickly classify every
girl as either a "vamp" or a "weep
er," anil the beat-look in** girls loce
out almost automatically.
Compared to the urban universi
ties of Europe, Stanford's Farm
seems extremely cloistered. At the
University of Paris the majority of
a student's friends are often non
students, and mo ,t ol his activities
do not center around the university.
The elected student government is
concerned almost solely with aca
i demic questions arid university pol
i icy, because there i i : no central
I campus and only one university
sponsored social function, an annual
dance.
More Politics
French students do take interna
tional politics much more seriously
than do their American counter
parts. Interest is constant, not con
fined to eletciori timo.
Dan compared French politics to
a football game, in which one team
has four tries to make a first down
before surrendering the ball to the
opposition, and may substitute a
different group of players with each
down. In the same w;»y the center
coalition may try several cabinets to
put its policies across, but if it fails
often enough, one of the extreme
partie3 will take over. So far the
center has always managed to make
its down in time.
Trying to explain what the renter
stands for, Dan grinned. "Well,
someone has to be in office." He
believes that the inherent stability
of the French government is best
demonstrated by the fact that
France has had.only two foreign
ministers since 1944, Bidault and
Schumann, fewer than either Brit
ain or the United State;;.

More Politics
French students do take interna
tional politics much more seriously
than do their American counter
parts. Interest is constant, not con
fined to eletciori timo.
Dan compared French politics to
a football game, in which one team
has four tries to make a first down
before surrendering the ball to the
opposition, and may substitute a
different group of players with each
down. In the same w;»y the center
coalition may try several cabinets to
put its policies across, but if it fails
often enough, one of the extreme
partie3 will take over. So far the
center has always managed to make
its down in time.
Trying to explain what the renter
stands for, Dan grinned. "Well,
someone has to be in office." He
believes that the inherent stability
of the French government is best
demonstrated by the fact that
France has had.only two foreign
ministers since 1944, Bidault and
Schumann, fewer than either Brit

—"The similarities are significant"
"Americans tend to stress the
differences in the foreign policies of
the Western nations, although ac
tually the similarities are far more
significant."
As examples of the common poli
cies of his nation and ours arrived
at by compromise, Daniel Charbon
nier, ASSU Foreign Scholar from
Paris, cited the present, German
agreements and the Korean and
Indo-Chinese wars.
Dan said that France is more than
willing to follow the leadership of
teh United States, as the most pow
erful of the group of Allies. How
ever, if the present alliance were
disbanded, or if the United States
stopped leading it, France would
once again pursue an independent
foreign policy.
Americans should remember, he
added, that right after the war
French policy did not coincide with
that of the United States, particu
larly on the German issues. Their
acceptance of n united West Ger
many and of German troops in the
European army are outstanding ex
amples of international co-opera
tion.
Many Degrees
Dan, an international relations
major, received degrees in law and
the social sciences and part of a

lumbering in England, and when
conversing with a taxi-driver upon
first arriving in New York, was
asked: ' How are things in England
these days?" That was the first—
and last -time that's ever happened
to him.

He explains his three simultane
ous degrees by describing the
French university system. The Uni
versity of Paris permits a student to
register at a nominal fee for as
many courses as he chooses, and
gives a degree to anyone passing the
requisite number of exams.
The catch is that approximately
70 per cent of the students flunk
any given exam. Several of Dan's
friends have been freshmen for .six
or seven years, and one fine exam
ple, a man of 41, has been trying to
attain sophomore status for SO
years.

requisite number of exams.
The catch is that approximately
70 per cent of the students flunk
any given exam. Several of Dan's
friends have been freshmen for .six
or seven years, and one fine exam
ple, a man of 41, has been trying to
attain sophomore status for SO
years.

Itatio Two to One

The ratio of men to women is
about the same at the University of
Paris as here—approximately two
to J but European women suffer
a great disadvantage taking oral ex
ams. The examiners suspect women
students of u r .ing feminine wile*' to

| put something over on them, and
build up a great defensive mecha
nism. They quickly classify every
girl as either a "vamp" or a "weep
er," anil the beat-look in** girls loce
out almost automatically.
Compared to the urban universi
ties of Europe, Stanford's Farm
seems extremely cloistered. At the
University of Paris the majority of
a student's friends are often non
students, and mo ,t ol his activities
do not center around the university.
The elected student government is
concerned almost solely with aca
i demic questions arid university pol
i icy, because there i i : no central
I campus and only one university
sponsored social function, an annual
dance.
More Politics
French students do take interna
tional politics much more seriously
than do their American counter
parts. Interest is constant, not con
fined to eletciori timo.
Dan compared French politics to
a football game, in which one team
has four tries to make a first down
before surrendering the ball to the
opposition, and may substitute a
different group of players with each
down. In the same w;»y the center
coalition may try several cabinets to
put its policies across, but if it fails
often enough, one of the extreme
partie3 will take over. So far the
center has always managed to make
its down in time.
Trying to explain what the renter
stands for, Dan grinned. "Well,
someone has to be in office." He
believes that the inherent stability
of the French government is best
demonstrated by the fact that
France has had.only two foreign
ministers since 1944, Bidault and
Schumann, fewer than either Brit
ain or the United State;;.
