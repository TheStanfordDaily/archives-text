# 'Browning Version' Is Modern Tragedy
## 
### MARK FRANKLIN 
The present offering at the
Guild Theater is "The Browning
Version," a British film based on
Terence Rattigan's one-act play,
which appeared in New York
two years ago.
This film well demonstrates that
the hero of modern tragedy is no
longer of epic stature, as he was in
the ancient dramas. Instead, he is
the obscure man, the man nobody
knows, until attention is paid to

him. Today's
tragic hero is
Mr. Chips, and
Willy Loman,
and now, with
"The Browning
Version," Ar -
th ur Crocker-
Harris, a dull,
pedantic master

of Latin and Greek at an English
public school.
To his students, he is humorless,
severe, uninspiring. To his wife, he
is weak, unexciting, lifeless. To
himself, he is a monumental failure.
It is his wife who has killed all
feeling and warmth in him. She is
sadistic, mercilessly taunting him
for all his failures. She even makes
him the confidant of an afiair she
is involved in with a younger
schoolmaster.
Failure Turns to Despair
His tragedy is heightened when,
forced by ill-health to resign the
post he has held for 18 years, his
request for a pension is denied.
Now, more than ever, possessed
with an overwhelming sense of fail
ure, he is overcome with despair.
But when an admiring student pre
sents him with a copy of Browning's
version of the "Agamemnon" as a
going-away present, all his emotion
bursts into life and he is, for the
first time, really happy. But his
wife will not even grant him this

single, isolated pleasure. She per
suades him the Loy offered him the
book only as a bribe to win his
doubtful promotion to the next
class.
Redgrave Restrained, Human
llow he finally triumphs over his
wife, and wins the hearts of the
students he thought he had failed,
is the poignant climax of this film.
Michael Redgrave's portrayal of
the pathetic Crocker-Harris is, at
once, dignified, restrained, and very
human. His characterization is
never maudlin or sentimental but,
rather, sincere and honest. Red
grave manages very sympatheti
cally to communicate the school
master's hidden warmth and tragic
sensitivity. It is, in fact, Redgrave's
performance that raises this film
from a static, monotonous investi
gation of an obscure pedant's life.

Changes of Scene Few

It is not even too much to say
that his performance is memorable,
considering that the whole film has
only three or four changes of scene.
The tiny glimpses of Crocker-Har
ris' real character are superbly
given in the classroom scenes and,
especially, in the scene in which he
confides to his young admirer about
the free translation of the "Aga
memnon" he himself had made but
never completed when he was
young.
The film is also interesting for its
realistic, often humorous insight
into the manners and morals of
English public school life. Impres
sive in its sincerity and perceptive
ness, this picture should certainly
not be missed.

The present offering at the
Guild Theater is "The Browning
Version," a British film based on
Terence Rattigan's one-act play,
which appeared in New York
two years ago.
This film well demonstrates that
the hero of modern tragedy is no
longer of epic stature, as he was in
the ancient dramas. Instead, he is
the obscure man, the man nobody
knows, until attention is paid to

him. Today's
tragic hero is
Mr. Chips, and
Willy Loman,
and now, with
"The Browning
Version," Ar -
th ur Crocker-
Harris, a dull,
pedantic master

of Latin and Greek at an English
public school.
To his students, he is humorless,
severe, uninspiring. To his wife, he
is weak, unexciting, lifeless. To
himself, he is a monumental failure.
It is his wife who has killed all
feeling and warmth in him. She is
sadistic, mercilessly taunting him
for all his failures. She even makes
him the confidant of an afiair she
is involved in with a younger
schoolmaster.
Failure Turns to Despair
His tragedy is heightened when,
forced by ill-health to resign the
post he has held for 18 years, his
request for a pension is denied.
Now, more than ever, possessed
with an overwhelming sense of fail
ure, he is overcome with despair.
But when an admiring student pre
sents him with a copy of Browning's
version of the "Agamemnon" as a
going-away present, all his emotion
bursts into life and he is, for the
first time, really happy. But his
wife will not even grant him this

single, isolated pleasure. She per
suades him the Loy offered him the
book only as a bribe to win his
doubtful promotion to the next
class.
Redgrave Restrained, Human
llow he finally triumphs over his
wife, and wins the hearts of the
students he thought he had failed,
is the poignant climax of this film.
Michael Redgrave's portrayal of
the pathetic Crocker-Harris is, at
once, dignified, restrained, and very
human. His characterization is
never maudlin or sentimental but,
rather, sincere and honest. Red
grave manages very sympatheti
cally to communicate the school
master's hidden warmth and tragic
sensitivity. It is, in fact, Redgrave's
performance that raises this film
from a static, monotonous investi
gation of an obscure pedant's life.

Changes of Scene Few

It is not even too much to say
that his performance is memorable,
considering that the whole film has
only three or four changes of scene.
The tiny glimpses of Crocker-Har
ris' real character are superbly
given in the classroom scenes and,
especially, in the scene in which he
confides to his young admirer about
the free translation of the "Aga
memnon" he himself had made but
never completed when he was
young.
The film is also interesting for its
realistic, often humorous insight
into the manners and morals of
English public school life. Impres
sive in its sincerity and perceptive
ness, this picture should certainly
not be missed.
