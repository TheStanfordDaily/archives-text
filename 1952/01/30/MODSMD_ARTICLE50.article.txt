### "DIGGER" ODELL 
This being my last column (retiring at an early age), I believe it's
only fitting that I say something about sports in general.
In the past few months so much has been said against sports—basket
ball fixes, de-emphasize football, etc.—that I feel inclined to come to the
defense of both amateur and professional sports.
Having been Sports Editor for the past volume, it has been my honor
to sit down in their offices and have a nice chal with a good many coaches
here at Stanford.
Gddly enough, you'll find that, for the most part, winning the next game
isn't uppermost in a coach's mind. Sure, they want to win (a coach's
time of service is usually correlated pretty highly with the number of
wins he has to his record), but the first thing that a coach thinks of is
the boys who are playing under him; not whether they have the stuff
it takes to win, but how they feel about the game, what the game is doing
lor them, or how they react in a game.
In short, the coaches here at Stanford—and I believe most coaches feel
this way—are aware that their job concerns primarily that of building men
out of boys. Laugh if you will, but it's a fact, and probably the athletes
themselves don't even realize it.
With all this talk about corruption in sports, nevertheless, most coaches
know that the character of their charges is more important than how he
did in last week's game. Coaches realize that sports engender in an in
dividual not only the spirit of fair competition, but a sense of interde
pendence with his fellow man.
Playing a game, say, of football with a bunch of boys at the level of
the sandlot, high school, or college gives a boy a feeling, not only of
belonging to the group, but of being an important cog in the machinery
of the universe. Maybe I've taken too many psychology courses, but I've
found that most coaches are way ahead of me on this point. Through sports
the feeling of the need for cooperation and hard work is built up in a boy.
All right, so you've heard of a hundred cases of fixing in basketball, of
rough play in football and other sports, or of cheating. Compare these mere
hundred cases with the millions of boys and girls who engage in sports
activities every day.
Scanning the sports pages the other day I came upon the finest example
of what sports are doing for society that I have seen in a long time.
Though it's not a first in the field, this case shows the effect sports, and
in this case professional sports, have on our culture. What the Texas
Baseball League did in a few short words was more than President Tru
man will ever do with his Civil Rights Program.
The Texas League has gone on record saying that they would be happy
to hire Negro baseball players who were good enough for the league.
Maybe this doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that Texas is
a southern state which has had an anti-Negro tradition, it means that
through sports the color line is being broken. I don't mean that it's been
completely shattered, but the big step has been taken, and it's been effected
through the field of sports.
Actually, the step was taken not long ago with the advent of the Texas
Rangers as a new member of professional football. The Rangers had al
ready signified that they would be willing to hire Negro football players
and this no doubt precipitated the Texas Baseball League action.
This is only an example of what sports are capable of. Most of its
benefits are hidden within the individual himself. Don't sell sports short;
nothing will ever replace them.

With all this talk about corruption in sports, nevertheless, most coaches
know that the character of their charges is more important than how he
did in last week's game. Coaches realize that sports engender in an in
dividual not only the spirit of fair competition, but a sense of interde
pendence with his fellow man.
Playing a game, say, of football with a bunch of boys at the level of
the sandlot, high school, or college gives a boy a feeling, not only of
belonging to the group, but of being an important cog in the machinery
of the universe. Maybe I've taken too many psychology courses, but I've
found that most coaches are way ahead of me on this point. Through sports
the feeling of the need for cooperation and hard work is built up in a boy.
All right, so you've heard of a hundred cases of fixing in basketball, of
rough play in football and other sports, or of cheating. Compare these mere
hundred cases with the millions of boys and girls who engage in sports
activities every day.
Scanning the sports pages the other day I came upon the finest example
of what sports are doing for society that I have seen in a long time.
Though it's not a first in the field, this case shows the effect sports, and
in this case professional sports, have on our culture. What the Texas
Baseball League did in a few short words was more than President Tru
man will ever do with his Civil Rights Program.
The Texas League has gone on record saying that they would be happy
to hire Negro baseball players who were good enough for the league.
Maybe this doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that Texas is
a southern state which has had an anti-Negro tradition, it means that
through sports the color line is being broken. I don't mean that it's been
completely shattered, but the big step has been taken, and it's been effected
through the field of sports.
Actually, the step was taken not long ago with the advent of the Texas
Rangers as a new member of professional football. The Rangers had al
ready signified that they would be willing to hire Negro football players
and this no doubt precipitated the Texas Baseball League action.
This is only an example of what sports are capable of. Most of its
benefits are hidden within the individual himself. Don't sell sports short;
nothing will ever replace them.
This being my last column (retiring at an early age), I believe it's
only fitting that I say something about sports in general.
In the past few months so much has been said against sports—basket
ball fixes, de-emphasize football, etc.—that I feel inclined to come to the
defense of both amateur and professional sports.
Having been Sports Editor for the past volume, it has been my honor
to sit down in their offices and have a nice chal with a good many coaches
here at Stanford.
Gddly enough, you'll find that, for the most part, winning the next game
isn't uppermost in a coach's mind. Sure, they want to win (a coach's
time of service is usually correlated pretty highly with the number of
wins he has to his record), but the first thing that a coach thinks of is
the boys who are playing under him; not whether they have the stuff
it takes to win, but how they feel about the game, what the game is doing
lor them, or how they react in a game.
In short, the coaches here at Stanford—and I believe most coaches feel
this way—are aware that their job concerns primarily that of building men
out of boys. Laugh if you will, but it's a fact, and probably the athletes
themselves don't even realize it.
