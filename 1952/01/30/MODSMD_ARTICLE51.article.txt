# First Round Will Begin In All-University Golf
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
With qualifying already out of
the way, some 20-odd golfers are
now beginning their first round of
Bob Blackburn meets John Elliott,
Golf Tournament.
Under the auspices of Golf Coach
Bud Finger, the players will com
plete the first round this week. De
fending champion, and number one
varsity golfer, Dick McElyea is re
covering from a cold and was
awarded a bye in the first round.
Low qualifying honors were won
by Rolfe Westgard, a graduate stu
dent, who shot a three-over-par 74.
The score was good considering the
extremely poor weather conditions
that prevailed. In second place were
Steve Murusic, also a grad student,
and last year's number three var
sity golfer, Roland Conklin. The
score was 75.
Outstanding matches are slated to
take place in the first round when
Braves' Mutt-and-JefT combination,
Grant Spaeth vs. Stu Rhodes, Dick
Taylor vs. Stu Ledbetter, and
Chuck Stark meets Fred Brown.
Westgard and Marusic, the two
grad students who did so well in

the qualifying round, will face a
stern test in the second round when
they meet respectively Keith Beek
man and the winner of the Brown-
Stark match.
