# Zetes Down Alpha Delts 43-31; Breakers Nip El Campo 36-27
## 
### 
Zeta Psi 11, led by forward Bob
Murphy and center Jim Cornish,
scored a convincing 43 to 31 victory
over Alpha Delt II in the first mural
game of the evening.
It was a relatively close game
through the first half, with the Zetes
finally pulling ahead at the inter
mission whistle, 17 to 12. With the
opening of the second quarter, they
applied the steam and rolled on to a
43-31 final score.
Ray Alexander of the Alpha Delts
was high point man of the game
with 15 points, followed by base
baller Murphy with 12 and Cornish
with 10.
In another early game, the Break
ers powered past El Campo by nine

points, 3G to 27, as El Campo just
couldn't get the range.
Don O'Neil of El Campo was
high of the game with II points,
followed by Breakers' Phil Saeta,
center, with 10 points; Len Gold
man, forward, with nine points,
and Bob Wilcox, forward,- with
eight points.
Again it was a case of superior
height on the boards that won the
gameâ€”a miss by El Campo usually
meant a lost ball.
