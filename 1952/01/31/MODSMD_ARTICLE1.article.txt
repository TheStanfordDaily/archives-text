# Cards Clip Spartans 71-66; Schorr, Tucker Stand Out
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
After a two and-a-half week famine, Stanford's basketball team
got back on the win trail with a convincing 71-66 victory over San
Jose State last night in the Pavilion. The Spartans played aggres
sive, hustling basketball, and went down fighting.
There was only one reason the Spartans were able to come

within hailing distance at all. That
was the sensational all around floor
play of San Jose's Mort Schorr. The
aggressive little guard constantly
harrassed the Cards on defense and
took high point honors with 18, 14 of
which came in the second half.
Coach Bob Burnett used liis re
serves freely, as three times during
the game he substituted a complete
second team of Zaninovich, John
son, Iversen, DeLong, and Andrews
for the starting five. The second
si lingers did surprisingly well as
they scored 11 points to the Spar
fans 11.
The outstanding men for Stanford
were Ed Tucker, Ron Tomsic, and
Jim Ramstead. Tucker turned in one
of his best floor games of the night
as he sparked drive after Card drive,
and led the Stanford scorers with 1 112».
Ramstead scored 14 and turned in
Stanford's outstanding defensive
game. He completely outfought the
Spartans' highly touted George Clark
under the boards and held George
to four fields goals out of 14 shots
taken. Tomsic, another offensive star,
scored 12 while holding his man to
two.
The Spartans were never in real
contention until midway in the
third period. With Stanford lead-,
ing -10-32, Mort Schorr hit a run
ning jump shot from 2ft feet out,
ami a few seconds later Elmer
Craig stole (he hall and dribbled
the length of the floor for another
two-pointer.
Lee Jensen stole the ball again for
the Spartans and was fouled while
attempting to shoot. He made both
free throws and San Jose trailed by
a mere two points.
Ed Tucker broke the back of the
Spartans, however, with an amaz
ing running, twisting jump shot
from the edge of the keyhole, and
from then on the game was never
really in doubt.
The Cards proceeded to roll on
like a well-oiled machine, using
substitutes freely and racking up
point after point. Midway in the
fourth quarter they led 61-51.
