The much debated issue of approving a constitution for the
now unofficial Stanford Young Republicans may come to a head
tomorrow, when Excom will meet with President J. Wallace Ster
ling. •
Sterling is expected to reveal the administration's standpoint

►which the Board of Trustees is ex
pected to follow, according to Barry
Jackson, chairman of Excom's con
stitution committee. Jackson brought
the issue up to date at Excom's meet
ing last night.
Excom recommended approval of
the group's constitution last quarter
to the Board of Trustees, which has
always followed a policy of disap
proval of partisan organizations at
Stanford.
The Board took no official action.
Instead, it turned the issue over to
Sterling. If the group is to be sanc
tioned now, it can be approved as
either a partisan or an educational
group.
Excom al o approved a Block
and Circle "S" proposal to set up
a bulletin board in front of the
Cellar. The primary purpose of
this would be to stimulate more
inttvest in minor sports by post
ing a picture of an athlete of the*
week, and listing the schedule of
coming athletic events. The plan
is sub ect to the approval of the
Union Board of Governors.
Excom heard reports from
Dwight Allen on (he winter quar
ter charity drive and from Olga
Aganaciefl, foreign scholarship
student from Paris.
Allen outlined plans for the drive,
which are to include personal let
ters to students, a subscription
campaign based on personal con
tacts, and a boat to be hung from
the banner in fiont of the Cellar,
which will move toward its destina
tion as the drive progresses.
Slogan of fhe drive, proceeds of
which will so to foreign student
relief, will be "Help the winds of
freedom blow."
Other actions taken by Excom
last night were: appropriation ot
$100 from the contingency fund to
,finance the student workshop proj
ect; approval of a constitution of a
Stanford chapter of the American
Institute of Architecture; and in
definite postponement of action on
the constitution of Baha'i, student
religious organization.
