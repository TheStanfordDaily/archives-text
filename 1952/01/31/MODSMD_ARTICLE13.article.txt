WASHINGTON. Jan. 30 (UP) â€”
Former Gov. Ellis Arna.ll of Georgia
r aid today after a White I lou -e visit
that President Truman "sounds
very much like a candidate" for re
election.
Arnall's statement plus the cir
cumstances surrounding his visit
added to the growing impression in
some quarters that the chief execu
tive is leaning toward running next
November.
Simultaneously, Sen. Robert A.
Taft agreed to be a candidate in
the New Hampshire Republican
primary but conceded that the odds
appeared to be stacked in favor of
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Mr. Truman's name also was en
tered in the New Hampshire Demo
cratic primary in opposition to Sen.
Estes Kefauver (D,, Trnn.), the only
avowed candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination.
Informants said the action v/as
taken without the President's ap
proval. He probably will withdraw
his name within the permitted 10
days' period.
