# 'Good Woman of Setzuan' Called 'Striking, Unusual'
## 
### DICK FREDELL 
A play d 3 striking and unusual as anyone in these parts is likely
to see anyplace, ever, opened a lour day run on the stage of tho
I.ittle Theatre last evening. We refer, of course, to the Stanford
Players' production of Bcrlolt Brecht's "The Good Woman of
Setzuan," and we are willing to wager that there never has been

nor will be anything quite like it
again.
Described as "a parable for the
theater." the play suggests the im
possibility of goodness in a mecha
nized, cut - throat society such a?
ours, whei-e honesty and love have
become no more than pretty wo'ds
which ling woefully false and hol
low.
In the telling of his tale, Brecht
has chosen to employ a number of
devices which deliberately prevent
the audience from emotional in
volvement with the characters, ari
attempt calculated to focus full
critical and rational attention 011 the
problem itself. 11 this is unconven
tional and controversial theater, it
is also exciting, new, and stimulat
ing theater.
Most unusual of all, perhaps, is
,the extensive use Brecht has made
of the conventions of Oriental
drama. Setting his play in China,
and populating it with distorted
Oriental characters, he proceeds lo
administer to his Western audiences
a moral dressing - down that is
thought-provoking and a bit terri
fying.
There is no pretense, in the pre:
entation of very poignant and n-al
problems, fo follow a realistic ap
proach. Rather, sets, ebaiacters,
and so forth are more a matter of
suggestion than anything ele, and
what really counts is the dialogue
itself. Brecht, however, has strayed
so far 11 om the beaten path that
startled au iiences may spend move
time looking than listening.
Director Nancy Langston i. tn be
congratulated on her superb job,
both for the physical production it
self and for the excellent perform
ances she has drawn from her ac
tors. Janet Karahadian, the little
girl with the big voire, pk>ys the
title role with incerity and warmth
Notable ton among he? -upporting

A play d 3 striking and unusual as anyone in these parts is likely
to see anyplace, ever, opened a lour day run on the stage of tho
I.ittle Theatre last evening. We refer, of course, to the Stanford
Players' production of Bcrlolt Brecht's "The Good Woman of
Setzuan," and we are willing to wager that there never has been

nor will be anything quite like it
again.
Described as "a parable for the
theater." the play suggests the im
possibility of goodness in a mecha
nized, cut - throat society such a?
ours, whei-e honesty and love have
become no more than pretty wo'ds
which ling woefully false and hol
low.
In the telling of his tale, Brecht
has chosen to employ a number of
devices which deliberately prevent
the audience from emotional in
volvement with the characters, ari
attempt calculated to focus full
critical and rational attention 011 the
problem itself. 11 this is unconven
tional and controversial theater, it
is also exciting, new, and stimulat
ing theater.
Most unusual of all, perhaps, is
,the extensive use Brecht has made
of the conventions of Oriental
drama. Setting his play in China,
and populating it with distorted
Oriental characters, he proceeds lo
administer to his Western audiences
a moral dressing - down that is
thought-provoking and a bit terri
fying.
There is no pretense, in the pre:
entation of very poignant and n-al
problems, fo follow a realistic ap
proach. Rather, sets, ebaiacters,
and so forth are more a matter of
suggestion than anything ele, and
what really counts is the dialogue
itself. Brecht, however, has strayed
so far 11 om the beaten path that
startled au iiences may spend move
time looking than listening.
Director Nancy Langston i. tn be
congratulated on her superb job,
both for the physical production it
self and for the excellent perform
ances she has drawn from her ac
tors. Janet Karahadian, the little
girl with the big voire, pk>ys the
title role with incerity and warmth

HIGH DRAMA—Janet Karahadian and Dave Kaplan enact a scene from the Stanford Players'
production of "The Good Woman of Setzuan" which opened last night at the Little Theatre.
