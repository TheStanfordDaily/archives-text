# Now That Money...

### 
Now that The Chappie has come to the sup
port of The Daily in the cloudy battle of news
paper finances, we'd like to clear up a few
points.
For those who missed yesterday's editorial
in the Chappie, the Old Boy wondered aloud
if anything was being done about the financial
crisis which the Daily faces.
Yes, we have a financial crisis of sorts. Un
fortunately it's an old story; our printing costs
have shot up alarmingly, our income is fixed.
There are plenty of other considerations, but
that's the basic picture.
Our income is derived mainly from a stu
dent fee taken from each quarter's tuition. This
fee—we'd rather call it a subscription payment

—is one dollar per quarter. The Union Board of
Governors wants to take 25 cents of this dollar,
which would leave us 75 cents, or a drop of
about $5,000 per year. The Union formetly re
ceived the 25 cents in question.
And the Old Boy wants to knew v/hat's being
done. On The Daily end of the line, in co
operation with university and student leaders,
plenty of worrying and figuring is going on.
We hope a substantial lowering of costs will
result.
But the Chappie suggestion that Excorn re
gard our dollar troubles as serious troubles
is good. The suggestion that Excorn weigh Ihe
high costs of newspaper publishing against the
intangible benefits of a good campus paper is
excellent.
