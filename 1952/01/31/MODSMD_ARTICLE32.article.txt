### BILL DAILEY 
(Editor's Note: The Daily concludes a short series
of re-prints of old and classic Bull Sessions with an
other Bill Dailey column today. Dailey's remarks,
written Jan. 16, 1951, concern his troubles with the
draft. Dick McLean will be back at his old spot
tomorrow.)
The minute I picked up my mail that morning I
felt thaf all was not right with my world. From with
in I heard a small voice say: "Don't open those letters,
you fool!" But I laughed at my childish fears. "After

all," I assured myself, "today is
,the day after Christmas, Decem
ber 26, 1950. What harm could
possibly occur on such a day as
this? What harm indeed?"
The first envelope I opened did
nothing to further my unexplain
able fears. It contained only a
late Christmas card from a cul
tural center in Los Angeles named
"Dolly's Bowery."
In one long sentence the man-

agement wished me a Merry Christmas, informed me
that "Jeanie, the Dresden Doll" was now once again
headlining their girlie show, and implored "would I
please come by and pick up my roommate, who had
been taking up space under a choice table since late
November."
"See," I chided myself, "there's nothing dangerous
in that letter. What are you so nervous about?"
The second letter I opened was a warning from
Stanford University that if 1 did not return my fall
quarter shower towel to the Men's Gym immediately,
I would not be allowed to enter the upper division in
Winter Quarter. Since I graduated from Stanford in
June, 1950, this message did not arouse any great
fear within me. I was beginning to feel better.
But then I saw IT. Ves, IT! THE THING! It was
a long, white envelope, and it stared up at ine
through its beady little postmark. In the upper

left comer were the words "Selective Service."
"Why is this guy Selective Service?" I auked my
self. "Probably somebody else to whom 1 should have
sent a Christmas card. Maybe he's a relative ol
Robert Service, who wrote "The Shooting ol Dan
McGrew," and other Elizabethan verses. Oh, well, so
I didn't send him a card. Maybe he'll forget by next
year." I opened the envelope.
I was right. It was clearly a Christinas card, for at
the top of the plain white paper was the traditional
Christmas salutation: "GREETINGS." i read on.
"Why, bless my soul," 1 exclaimed, ( upon closer ex
amination. "Tins Christmas card is from The Presi
dent. Imagine The President taking time out to write
a letter to little old me who has never even heaul
Margaret sing!"
And there was no denying it. This was unmis
takably a yuletide card from Mr. Tinman. It said:
"The President of the United States tit William
Francis Dailey, 4-53-28 -225, 1816 Sylvan Circle, San
Leandro, California GREETINGS. Having sub
mitted yourself to a local board of your neighbors
for the purpose of determining your availability lor
service in the aimed forces of the United States,
you are hereby ordered to report to . . ."
"Egad," I shouted, "this is no Christinas card! It's
a trap. I'VE BEEN DRAFTED!"
"No, No," I cried, "Not me! They can't do this to
me! I'm a Stanford man. A Republican. They can't
do it. I won't, go! Do you hear me? 1 won't go! 1
won't. I won't. 1 won't!"

And as I finish writing this paragraph, an army bus
is pulling into Fort Ord, near Monterey. And who do
you think is on it?
Oh, well, I've only myself to blame. I should have
known this was going to happen when I read that
advertisement. How well 1 remembfr those words:
"There's a Fort in Your Future."

"No, No," I cried, "Not me! They can't do this to
me! I'm a Stanford man. A Republican. They can't
do it. I won't, go! Do you hear me? 1 won't go! 1
won't. I won't. 1 won't!"

And as I finish writing this paragraph, an army bus
is pulling into Fort Ord, near Monterey. And who do
you think is on it?
Oh, well, I've only myself to blame. I should have
known this was going to happen when I read that
advertisement. How well 1 remembfr those words:
"There's a Fort in Your Future."

The minute I picked up my mail that morning I
felt thaf all was not right with my world. From with
in I heard a small voice say: "Don't open those letters,
you fool!" But I laughed at my childish fears. "After

all," I assured myself, "today is
,the day after Christmas, Decem
ber 26, 1950. What harm could
possibly occur on such a day as
this? What harm indeed?"
The first envelope I opened did
nothing to further my unexplain
able fears. It contained only a
late Christmas card from a cul
tural center in Los Angeles named
"Dolly's Bowery."
In one long sentence the man-

agement wished me a Merry Christmas, informed me
that "Jeanie, the Dresden Doll" was now once again
headlining their girlie show, and implored "would I
please come by and pick up my roommate, who had
been taking up space under a choice table since late
November."
"See," I chided myself, "there's nothing dangerous
in that letter. What are you so nervous about?"
The second letter I opened was a warning from
Stanford University that if 1 did not return my fall
quarter shower towel to the Men's Gym immediately,
I would not be allowed to enter the upper division in
Winter Quarter. Since I graduated from Stanford in
June, 1950, this message did not arouse any great
fear within me. I was beginning to feel better.
But then I saw IT. Ves, IT! THE THING! It was
a long, white envelope, and it stared up at ine
through its beady little postmark. In the upper

left comer were the words "Selective Service."
"Why is this guy Selective Service?" I auked my
self. "Probably somebody else to whom 1 should have
sent a Christmas card. Maybe he's a relative ol
Robert Service, who wrote "The Shooting ol Dan
McGrew," and other Elizabethan verses. Oh, well, so
I didn't send him a card. Maybe he'll forget by next
year." I opened the envelope.
I was right. It was clearly a Christinas card, for at
the top of the plain white paper was the traditional
Christmas salutation: "GREETINGS." i read on.
"Why, bless my soul," 1 exclaimed, ( upon closer ex
amination. "Tins Christmas card is from The Presi
dent. Imagine The President taking time out to write
a letter to little old me who has never even heaul
Margaret sing!"
And there was no denying it. This was unmis
takably a yuletide card from Mr. Tinman. It said:
"The President of the United States tit William
Francis Dailey, 4-53-28 -225, 1816 Sylvan Circle, San
Leandro, California GREETINGS. Having sub
mitted yourself to a local board of your neighbors
for the purpose of determining your availability lor
service in the aimed forces of the United States,
you are hereby ordered to report to . . ."
"Egad," I shouted, "this is no Christinas card! It's
a trap. I'VE BEEN DRAFTED!"
"No, No," I cried, "Not me! They can't do this to
me! I'm a Stanford man. A Republican. They can't
do it. I won't, go! Do you hear me? 1 won't go! 1

takably a yuletide card from Mr. Tinman. It said:
"The President of the United States tit William
Francis Dailey, 4-53-28 -225, 1816 Sylvan Circle, San
Leandro, California GREETINGS. Having sub
mitted yourself to a local board of your neighbors
for the purpose of determining your availability lor
service in the aimed forces of the United States,
you are hereby ordered to report to . . ."
"Egad," I shouted, "this is no Christinas card! It's
a trap. I'VE BEEN DRAFTED!"
"No, No," I cried, "Not me! They can't do this to
me! I'm a Stanford man. A Republican. They can't
do it. I won't, go! Do you hear me? 1 won't go! 1
won't. I won't. 1 won't!"

And as I finish writing this paragraph, an army bus
is pulling into Fort Ord, near Monterey. And who do
you think is on it?
Oh, well, I've only myself to blame. I should have
known this was going to happen when I read that
advertisement. How well 1 remembfr those words:
"There's a Fort in Your Future."
