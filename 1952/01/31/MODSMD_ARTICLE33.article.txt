# Plight, Struggle, Anti-West Sentiment Observed in Arab Lands of Contrasts
## 
### HOLBROOK TETER 
(Daily night editor Holbrock
Teter continues his series of ar
ticles on Ids 20,000 - mile trip
around the Mediterranean Sea
last summer and early fall.)

We arrived in Beirut at night
and slept on a park bench on
the campus of the American
University there. Leaving Tur
key v/e had driven along the
short Mediterranean coast ol
Syria and had come into the
lush and greenly beautiful land
of Lebanon.
We immediately liked this new
and very different part of the
world—these Arab lands so full
of contrast and struggle. Mod
ernism versus the century - old
ways of life. Nationalism versus
Western influence. The people
versus their governments. .Arab
versus Jew.
In Beirut, Damascus, and Amman,
the ancient and crowded old cities
butted heavily aaginst the proud
modern architecture of new hotels
and apartment buildings. In the
narrow and winding old streets, as
on the broad, tree-lined boulevards,
men in Western business clothes—
often wearing a flowing Arab head
dress—mingled with others in the
colorful dress of Biblical days.
On tire smooth, paved highways
streanflined American cars whiz
zed by slow-moving camel cara
vans led by a small man on a
small burro. A vast oil refinery
abruptly interrupted the proces-

sion of small Arab homes and
fields.
But blotting all this into insig
nificance is the live, tense issue
which burns uppermost in the Arab
mind of this region — the Arab-
Jewish problem. Everyone we
talked to wanted us to know their
point of view, saying that in the
United States we get only "Jewish
propaganda."
Although Great Britain is almost
universally damned, some hate
America even more for the role that
the United States has played in the
setting up of Israel. A poll at the
American University taken in 1950
showed that 74 per cent of the
students were anti-American, 3 pei
cent pro, and the rest undecided.
Nevertheless, everyone was ex
tremely friendly and helpful, and
showed no hostility toward us.
(With one exception in Jerusa
lem, where the tension is great
est. I had sprouted a short beard,
evidently the kind favored by
young Jewish men, and was near
ly mobbed in the street.)
The Arabs argued the question
from all sides. Some told us unhap
py stories of personal dispossession
and misfortune. Others complained
that the Jew has no more right to
Palestine than the Moors do to
Spain or the Indians to America. In
fact, not even as much, we were
told.
Still others revealed the terrible
plight of the Arab refugee. There
are no# some 900,000 refugees
living in camps in Lebanon, Syr
ia, Transjordan, and the Gaza
i..-ea. We saw some of these

camps, with their wretched, de
spairing occupants, huddled mis
erably in a giove of trees or,
worse, simply on the rand l.e
rieath the desert sun. The United
Nations is doing what il can, a
member of the American consul
ate told us, but its aid is far from
adequate.
We visited Damascus and Am
man, capital of Transjordan. Then,
after taking a short float, in the
Dead Sea, we came to Jerusalem.
The Arabs are in possession of
the old city of Jerusalem, and we
were able to see most of the holy
places—the Repulcher, Gethrem
ane, Betide'hem, Bethany.
We arrived in Jerusalem a few
days after the assassination of Ab
dullah, king of Transjordan. The
black flags of mourning hung from
many houses. But many rejoiced,
saying that it had to Le done and
that there are others who must go—
those who are too friendly with the
West, those who accept too easily
the Palestine situation, those who
are oppressing the people.
A young university student ap
plauded the assassination because,
he said, it is the only way the
people can fifcht against the gov
ernments which are supported by
the West, The United States gives
money to the governments, the
officials enrich themselves, and
the people get nothing.
"Wp don't want the West—or the
East," he told us. Another agreed
with him, saying, "The United
States likes freedom, but she must
remember that other nations love
their freedom also."

But blotting all this into insig
nificance is the live, tense issue
which burns uppermost in the Arab
mind of this region — the Arab-
Jewish problem. Everyone we
talked to wanted us to know their
point of view, saying that in the

propaganda."
Although Great Britain is almost
universally damned, some hate
America even more for the role that
the United States has played in the
setting up of Israel. A poll at the

students were anti-American, 3 pei
cent pro, and the rest undecided.
Nevertheless, everyone was ex
tremely friendly and helpful, and
showed no hostility toward us.

The Arabs argued the question
from all sides. Some told us unhap
py stories of personal dispossession
and misfortune. Others complained
that the Jew has no more right to
Palestine than the Moors do to
Spain or the Indians to America. In
fact, not even as much, we were
told.
Still others revealed the terrible
plight of the Arab refugee. There
are no# some 900,000 refugees
living in camps in Lebanon, Syr
ia, Transjordan, and the Gaza
i..-ea. We saw some of these

camps, with their wretched, de
spairing occupants, huddled mis
erably in a giove of trees or,
worse, simply on the rand l.e
rieath the desert sun. The United
Nations is doing what il can, a
member of the American consul
ate told us, but its aid is far from
adequate.
We visited Damascus and Am
man, capital of Transjordan. Then,
after taking a short float, in the
Dead Sea, we came to Jerusalem.
The Arabs are in possession of
the old city of Jerusalem, and we
were able to see most of the holy
places—the Repulcher, Gethrem
ane, Betide'hem, Bethany.
We arrived in Jerusalem a few
days after the assassination of Ab
dullah, king of Transjordan. The
black flags of mourning hung from
many houses. But many rejoiced,
saying that it had to Le done and
that there are others who must go—
those who are too friendly with the
West, those who accept too easily
the Palestine situation, those who
are oppressing the people.
A young university student ap
plauded the assassination because,
he said, it is the only way the
people can fifcht against the gov
ernments which are supported by
the West, The United States gives
money to the governments, the
officials enrich themselves, and
the people get nothing.
"Wp don't want the West—or the
East," he told us. Another agreed
with him, saying, "The United
States likes freedom, but she must
remember that other nations love
their freedom also."

lem, where the tension is great
est. I had sprouted a short beard,
evidently the kind favored by
young Jewish men, and was near
ly mobbed in the street.)
The Arabs argued the question
from all sides. Some told us unhap
py stories of personal dispossession
and misfortune. Others complained
that the Jew has no more right to
Palestine than the Moors do to
Spain or the Indians to America. In
fact, not even as much, we were
told.
Still others revealed the terrible
plight of the Arab refugee. There
are no# some 900,000 refugees
living in camps in Lebanon, Syr
ia, Transjordan, and the Gaza
i..-ea. We saw some of these

camps, with their wretched, de
spairing occupants, huddled mis
erably in a giove of trees or,
worse, simply on the rand l.e
rieath the desert sun. The United
Nations is doing what il can, a
member of the American consul
ate told us, but its aid is far from
adequate.
We visited Damascus and Am
man, capital of Transjordan. Then,
after taking a short float, in the
Dead Sea, we came to Jerusalem.
The Arabs are in possession of
the old city of Jerusalem, and we
were able to see most of the holy
places—the Repulcher, Gethrem
ane, Betide'hem, Bethany.
We arrived in Jerusalem a few
days after the assassination of Ab
dullah, king of Transjordan. The
black flags of mourning hung from
many houses. But many rejoiced,
saying that it had to Le done and
that there are others who must go—
those who are too friendly with the
West, those who accept too easily
the Palestine situation, those who
are oppressing the people.
A young university student ap
plauded the assassination because,
he said, it is the only way the
people can fifcht against the gov
ernments which are supported by
the West, The United States gives
money to the governments, the
officials enrich themselves, and
the people get nothing.
"Wp don't want the West—or the
East," he told us. Another agreed
with him, saying, "The United
States likes freedom, but she must
remember that other nations love
their freedom also."

We arrived in Beirut at night
and slept on a park bench on
the campus of the American
University there. Leaving Tur
key v/e had driven along the
short Mediterranean coast ol
Syria and had come into the
lush and greenly beautiful land
of Lebanon.
We immediately liked this new
and very different part of the
world—these Arab lands so full
of contrast and struggle. Mod
ernism versus the century - old
ways of life. Nationalism versus
Western influence. The people
versus their governments. .Arab
versus Jew.
In Beirut, Damascus, and Amman,
the ancient and crowded old cities
butted heavily aaginst the proud
modern architecture of new hotels
and apartment buildings. In the
narrow and winding old streets, as
on the broad, tree-lined boulevards,
men in Western business clothes—
often wearing a flowing Arab head
dress—mingled with others in the
colorful dress of Biblical days.
On tire smooth, paved highways
streanflined American cars whiz
zed by slow-moving camel cara
vans led by a small man on a
small burro. A vast oil refinery
abruptly interrupted the proces-

sion of small Arab homes and
fields.
But blotting all this into insig
nificance is the live, tense issue
which burns uppermost in the Arab
mind of this region — the Arab-
Jewish problem. Everyone we
talked to wanted us to know their
point of view, saying that in the
United States we get only "Jewish
propaganda."
Although Great Britain is almost
universally damned, some hate
America even more for the role that
the United States has played in the
setting up of Israel. A poll at the
American University taken in 1950
showed that 74 per cent of the
students were anti-American, 3 pei
cent pro, and the rest undecided.
Nevertheless, everyone was ex
tremely friendly and helpful, and
showed no hostility toward us.
