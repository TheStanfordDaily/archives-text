# No Vocational Talks Slated for This Year

### DEAN MATUCHA 
No vocational guidance talks
for seniors are planned for this
year, it was revealed yesterday
by Eugene Dils, Placement Serv
ice director.
Dils gave as the reason for this a
lack of interest shown in last year's
talks. "However," he added, "it does
not mean that talks for this year
are definitely off. If enough men
were to ask that talks be held, they
could still be arranged, even as
late as March or April."
At present, no men's vorom is
in existence. Should a demand
arise for talks this year, Dils said,
lie would ask Excom to appoint a
vocom chairman. The chairman
would select a committee which
could arrange talks.
Vocational guidance talks were
initiated at Stanford three years
ago, when representatives from
various business concerns came to
talk to freshmen at Stanford.
The freshmen were apparently
more concerned with the immediate
problems of adjustment to college
life than they were with the dis
tant problem of earning a living.
The program was repeated two
years ago, and then was dropped,
as the frosh continued to show lit
tle or no interest.
Last year, acting on the premise
that seniors would be more inter
ested in vocational problems than
freshmen, a series of talks for sen

ior men was arranged, under the di
rection of a men's vocom and Dils.
The seniors showed little more
interest than the frosh had. The
businessmen who came were
clearly discouraged by the small
turnouts at their talks. There
fore Dils has made no plans for
this year.
A more successful auvice-to-stu
dents program was launched last
year as a by-product of the voca
tional talks. This program consisted
of talks by representatives from
each of the University departments,
directed primarily at sophomores
and designed to aid students in
choosing a major field. The talks
were well attended, and will be re
peated this year.
