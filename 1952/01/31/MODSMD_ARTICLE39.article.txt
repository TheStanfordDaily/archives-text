# Branner Women Vote To Revise Constitution
## 
### 
In an all-dorm vote held recently,
Branner women voted to adopt
several suggested revisions for the
hall con_.titution.
Most important among the
changes was an article allowing a
lreshman to hold the office of presi
dent instead of requiring the in
cumbent to be a sophomore or jun
ior as in previous years. This change
will go into effect as Branner holds
its elections next week.
Secondly, instead of having two
vice - presidents, it was voted to
have only one who would assist the
president in her duties. A social
chairman was provided to replace
the office of second vice-president.

Other adoptions provided that the
sponsor would preside over corri
dor meetings during full quarter,
and a freshman senator would he
elected to take her place during
winter quarter. It was also voted
that a freshman AWS ex - officio
representative should he appointed
by the hall excom by the fifth week
of fail quarter.
These revisions resulted from the
fact that Branner has become a
dorm which houses mostly fresh
man women instead of sophomores
or juniors.
