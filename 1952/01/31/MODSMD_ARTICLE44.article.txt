Many are puzzled why Stanford is not leading the PCC Southern Di
vision. They are basing their bewilderment on the fact that Ed Tucker,
Jim Ramstead, Eon Tomsic and Jim Walsh are the top four in conference
scoring.
The answer is easy. The Indians can score a hundred points a game,
but if the opponent scores just a little more, chalk up a loss. That is
exactly what has happened to Stanford. The statistics prove it.
In six Conference games the Cards have totaled 402 points to lead
the Division in amassing counters. But looking at the other side of the

ledger, Mamorn s s.x ri iocs
have run up a total of 4.'!G paints,
which is 7!) points mare than have
been scored against any of the
other three Conference teams,
USC, UCLA, or Cal.
There is a saying that goes "the
best defense is a good offense." Stan
ford this year has done a good job of
tearing that theory apart. The Card
defense will have to pick up for the
remainder of the season, or the In
dians will lead the scoring race all
right, but will bring up the rear in
the title chase.
SPEAKING OF BASKETBALL,
Bob Kurland, a bit; seven footer,
leads his Phillip's Oilers into the Pa
vilion Saturday night to do battle
with the Indians. We wonder iust
how much of a battle it will bo.
Stanford doesn't figure to win it.
In fact we don't see who is going to
get any rebounds for the Cards. With
Jim Ramstead the only first stringer
over 6'4", the Indians will be looking

up to a team that averages over (i' 4" per man.
Il should he a great show. Almost as good as having the Itarlcm Globe
Trotters come to town.
HOW NICE that the Office of Admissions has recently been flooded by
numerous applications for admission • into this "athletic, power" of the
West. Applications have increased greatly over last year, and the reason:
national prominence because of the Rose Bowl. The loss doesn't mean
anything, just the fact that Stanford got there is enough to entice these
prep athletes.
All that is fine and good, and God bless these athletes who want to
further their education at our institution. However it does seem too bad
that a University of Stanford's standing receives most recognition, not
from academic doings, but rather from athletic endeavors.
RUMOR HAS IT that USC footballers who dropped the Bowl de
ciding 27-20 grid titanic to Stanford last November have vowed to heat
the Indians when they meet in Stanford Stadium this year. We recall a
group of Stanford sophomores who in the early thirties vowed not to
lose to the Trojans. Ami they didn't for three years. We trust and cross
everything we own USC won't take these vows too seriously come
autumn.
While on football, we noted in n newspaper account that Joe Kuharich,
new Chicago Cardinal coach, commented that he had appointed no as
sistants but was after, among others, Joe Ruetz, Stanford line coach.
We spoke to Joe the other afternoon and he said that there was definitely
nothing tg it. He plans to stay at Stanford.
While on line coaches, we should mention that Phil Bengston, who went
to the Forty-Niners following the Stanford grid shakeup, did a pretty good
job. He took a handful of rookies and pairing them with a few veterans
turned up with one of the finest linos in the professional circuit.
IT MUST BE SPRING. Stanford's Varsity Tennis squad, destined by
many to really go places this year, tangles with their first opponent this
Saturday. The Indians will meet a Palo Alto Tennis Club team led by
Ellis Slack, one of the leading racket handlers in the State.
Stanford has five returning lettcrmen; George Gentry, Charles Hickox,
Tom Lewyn, Dean Brinkman, and Bob Sibert. In addition the squad will
he rounded out by soph greats, Jim Cornish and Art Fish. George Stew
art, only a frosh, shows great promise.

Bob Kurland, a bit; seven footer,
leads his Phillip's Oilers into the Pa
vilion Saturday night to do battle
with the Indians. We wonder iust
how much of a battle it will bo.
Stanford doesn't figure to win it.
In fact we don't see who is going to
get any rebounds for the Cards. With
Jim Ramstead the only first stringer
over 6'4", the Indians will be looking

up to a team that averages over (i' 4" per man.
Il should he a great show. Almost as good as having the Itarlcm Globe
Trotters come to town.
HOW NICE that the Office of Admissions has recently been flooded by
numerous applications for admission • into this "athletic, power" of the
West. Applications have increased greatly over last year, and the reason:
national prominence because of the Rose Bowl. The loss doesn't mean
anything, just the fact that Stanford got there is enough to entice these
prep athletes.
All that is fine and good, and God bless these athletes who want to
further their education at our institution. However it does seem too bad
that a University of Stanford's standing receives most recognition, not
from academic doings, but rather from athletic endeavors.
RUMOR HAS IT that USC footballers who dropped the Bowl de
ciding 27-20 grid titanic to Stanford last November have vowed to heat
the Indians when they meet in Stanford Stadium this year. We recall a
group of Stanford sophomores who in the early thirties vowed not to
lose to the Trojans. Ami they didn't for three years. We trust and cross
everything we own USC won't take these vows too seriously come
autumn.
While on football, we noted in n newspaper account that Joe Kuharich,
new Chicago Cardinal coach, commented that he had appointed no as
sistants but was after, among others, Joe Ruetz, Stanford line coach.
We spoke to Joe the other afternoon and he said that there was definitely
nothing tg it. He plans to stay at Stanford.
While on line coaches, we should mention that Phil Bengston, who went
to the Forty-Niners following the Stanford grid shakeup, did a pretty good
job. He took a handful of rookies and pairing them with a few veterans
turned up with one of the finest linos in the professional circuit.
IT MUST BE SPRING. Stanford's Varsity Tennis squad, destined by
many to really go places this year, tangles with their first opponent this
Saturday. The Indians will meet a Palo Alto Tennis Club team led by
Ellis Slack, one of the leading racket handlers in the State.
Stanford has five returning lettcrmen; George Gentry, Charles Hickox,
Tom Lewyn, Dean Brinkman, and Bob Sibert. In addition the squad will
he rounded out by soph greats, Jim Cornish and Art Fish. George Stew
art, only a frosh, shows great promise.


JOE RUETZ
Many are puzzled why Stanford is not leading the PCC Southern Di
vision. They are basing their bewilderment on the fact that Ed Tucker,
Jim Ramstead, Eon Tomsic and Jim Walsh are the top four in conference
scoring.
The answer is easy. The Indians can score a hundred points a game,
but if the opponent scores just a little more, chalk up a loss. That is
exactly what has happened to Stanford. The statistics prove it.
In six Conference games the Cards have totaled 402 points to lead
the Division in amassing counters. But looking at the other side of the

ledger, Mamorn s s.x ri iocs
have run up a total of 4.'!G paints,
which is 7!) points mare than have
been scored against any of the
other three Conference teams,
USC, UCLA, or Cal.
There is a saying that goes "the
best defense is a good offense." Stan
ford this year has done a good job of
tearing that theory apart. The Card
defense will have to pick up for the
remainder of the season, or the In
dians will lead the scoring race all
right, but will bring up the rear in
the title chase.
