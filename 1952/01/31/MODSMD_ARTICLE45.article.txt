# LOW SCORE: 37 TO 30
## Platoon System Braves Freeze Out San Jose JV 
### DICK MALTZMAN 
Stanf or d's pseudo-Braves,
alias the second team Stanford
Varsity, teamed up with the reg
ular JV's to hand what was sup
posed to be a good San Jose JV
team a 37-30 loss.
The starting lineup for the braves
was Gary Andrews and George Zan
inovieh, at the forwards, Don DeLong
at center, and Bruce Iverson and
Paul Johnson at the guards—all sec
ond string Varsity men. San Jose
started its regular lineup.
"Frozen" First Half
The first half was a brilliant ex
ample of "defensive basketball," with
both teams spending the majority of
the time "freezing" the ball. Each
team shot approximately ten times
in the first half, and each had three
field goals.
The score was 7-4 Stanford at the
end of the first quarter, but a last
minute rally in the closing minutes
of the second quarter brought the
Spartan Jayvees to within one point
of the Braves, 11-10.
DeLong and Johnson shared high
point honors in the first half with
three points each. Both teams used
a shifting man to man defense that
left little to be desired — exeept
points.
Speedy Second Half
The second half was a completely
different game, as Coach Gus Cha
valas sent in his real JV speed
burners. The starting lineup for the
second half had Dick Carver and
Roger Irvine at the forwards, Russ
Lawler at the center spot, and Jim
Johnson and Wayne Lockhart at the
guards.
The JV's, having played together
for the entire season, brought an
immediate speedup to the ball game.
Led by Dick Carver's eight points,
the Braves pulled ahead by a 26 to
14 count at the end of the third
quarter.

Three Long Sinkers
In the opening minutes of the

fourth quarter, Russ Ljiwler and Jim
Johnson teamed up to give the
Braves a 16 point lead, 34-18. Mid
way in the last period, the Spartans
found their long range eye and closed
the gap to 37-30. In this last spurt,
Bud Hjelm and Dick Zimmerman
scored from 20 feet out and Sal
Burriesci scored two one-handed
push shots from 30 feet and 40 feet.

was high point man with 12, which
made him high for the game. Bud
