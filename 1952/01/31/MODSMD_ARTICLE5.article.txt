# Coeds Get a Scare; Stork Visits Branner
## 
### 
Branner girls received a rude
start this afternoon when a large
bird resembling a stork appeared
near Escondido Road, on the field
adjoining the building.
The stork seemed to be in no
hurry to leave, as he settled in
the field and remained there,
completely unfazed by passing
cars, for the remainder of the af
ternoon.
Contrary to what it may seem,
Branner has reported no recent
births.
