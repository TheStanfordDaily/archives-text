# IDEAS ON ART
## Kahn Explains Appraisal 
### MARK FRANKLIN 
"The best way to judge a new
and unfamiliar art form is to
bring background to that form,
background gained simply from
looking at pictures," asserted
Matt Kahn, instructor in design
in the Stanford Art Department.
Essentially, Mr. Kahn means that
this "background" merely provides
a basis for approach when we come
to new art forms.
Background in Appraisal
In addition, it allows us to sus
pend our appraisals and judgments
until after we've assimilated the art
form. No longer confuscd by what
we see, we have this background as
a "frame of reference" upon which
we may rely when we make our
judgments. '
In addition, Mr. Kahn believes
that new standards ought to develop
when judging new idioms in art.
New standards help to guide and di
rect our approach, with the won
derful result that new standards
joined with a substantial back
ground form a perfect basis on
which to judge and appraise.
Function of Color
Color, although important, said
Mr. Kahn, is not necessarily the
dominant force in his v->rk. Rather,
it is fused with other c'ements like
shape, texture, line, and arranqe
ment.
Color is only one of the elements,

one of the parts related to the
whole. Its function is to distribute
the ideas, with varying degrees of
emphasis.
In answer to the question, "Does
your work occur to you first in
conscious words and images?" Mr.
Kahn replied that it is thought
about while it is done. There may
be some analysis while the work is
in progress, but ideas occur intui
tively, and arc not planned before
hand.
Intuitive Process
The whole creative process is
mainly unconscious, and becomes
articulate only when the actual
work is begun. Real appraisal and
examination, however, occur usu
ally afterward in moments of tran
quility, when some perspective is
gained. With re-examination, Mr.
Kahn asserted that diversity in his
work invariably followed.
Mr. Kahn explained that the
beautiful jewelry work on exhibit
consisted of original forms, designed
to harmonize with the personality of
the people for whom they were
made. Mr. Kahn said that "appro
priateness" guided his designs, ex
plaining that he attempted to unite
the physical and spiritual charac
teristics of the individual.
The young instructor's wife, Lyda
Weyl, contributed the series of
weavings that are also on display.
All types of fabrics were used: cot
ton, rayon, linen, silk, and wool.
Mi.-s Weyl was motivated by two
ideas: First, that weavings were

made to serve a definite and useful
purpose, such as apparel, household
design, upholstcary.
Second, that other weavings were
produced purely for the sake of
decoration. One outstanding weav
ing of this kind is an unusual drape
which consists of aluminum span
gles interwoven with the fabric. The
fabric itself, a coarse linen and cot
ton, represents matter and solidity,
while the aluminum stands for elu
siveness and fantasy. The contrast
thus produced is extremely striking.
"Schools" for the Critics
When asked if he belonged to any
particular "school," or "movement,"
or "trend" in art, Mr. Kahn smiled,
and gestured to his paintings.
"No," he declared, "I don't con
sider myself a member of this
school or that movement. I doubt if
any artist really does. He just goes
ahead and does his work arid leaves
all the arguing about schools and
movements to the critics.
"After all, the artist is a pretty
busy man. He does his work first,
and then he's put in a school. He
doesn't choose the school for him
self. But that's not too important
to him, anyway."

work is begun. Real appraisal and
examination, however, occur usu
ally afterward in moments of tran
quility, when some perspective is
gained. With re-examination, Mr.
Kahn asserted that diversity in his
work invariably followed.
Mr. Kahn explained that the
beautiful jewelry work on exhibit
consisted of original forms, designed
to harmonize with the personality of
the people for whom they were
made. Mr. Kahn said that "appro
priateness" guided his designs, ex
plaining that he attempted to unite
the physical and spiritual charac
teristics of the individual.
The young instructor's wife, Lyda
Weyl, contributed the series of
weavings that are also on display.
All types of fabrics were used: cot
ton, rayon, linen, silk, and wool.
Mi.-s Weyl was motivated by two
ideas: First, that weavings were

made to serve a definite and useful
purpose, such as apparel, household
design, upholstcary.
Second, that other weavings were
produced purely for the sake of
decoration. One outstanding weav
ing of this kind is an unusual drape
which consists of aluminum span
gles interwoven with the fabric. The
fabric itself, a coarse linen and cot
ton, represents matter and solidity,
while the aluminum stands for elu
siveness and fantasy. The contrast
thus produced is extremely striking.
"Schools" for the Critics
When asked if he belonged to any
particular "school," or "movement,"
or "trend" in art, Mr. Kahn smiled,
and gestured to his paintings.
"No," he declared, "I don't con
sider myself a member of this
school or that movement. I doubt if
any artist really does. He just goes
ahead and does his work arid leaves
all the arguing about schools and
movements to the critics.
"After all, the artist is a pretty
busy man. He does his work first,
and then he's put in a school. He
doesn't choose the school for him
self. But that's not too important
to him, anyway."
"The best way to judge a new
and unfamiliar art form is to
bring background to that form,
background gained simply from
looking at pictures," asserted
Matt Kahn, instructor in design
in the Stanford Art Department.
Essentially, Mr. Kahn means that
this "background" merely provides
a basis for approach when we come
to new art forms.
Background in Appraisal
In addition, it allows us to sus
pend our appraisals and judgments
until after we've assimilated the art
form. No longer confuscd by what
we see, we have this background as
a "frame of reference" upon which
we may rely when we make our
judgments. '
In addition, Mr. Kahn believes
that new standards ought to develop
when judging new idioms in art.
New standards help to guide and di
rect our approach, with the won
derful result that new standards
joined with a substantial back
ground form a perfect basis on
which to judge and appraise.
Function of Color
Color, although important, said
Mr. Kahn, is not necessarily the
dominant force in his v->rk. Rather,
it is fused with other c'ements like
shape, texture, line, and arranqe
ment.
Color is only one of the elements,

one of the parts related to the
whole. Its function is to distribute
the ideas, with varying degrees of
emphasis.
In answer to the question, "Does
your work occur to you first in
conscious words and images?" Mr.
Kahn replied that it is thought
about while it is done. There may
be some analysis while the work is
in progress, but ideas occur intui
tively, and arc not planned before
hand.
Intuitive Process
The whole creative process is
mainly unconscious, and becomes
articulate only when the actual
work is begun. Real appraisal and
examination, however, occur usu
ally afterward in moments of tran
quility, when some perspective is
gained. With re-examination, Mr.
