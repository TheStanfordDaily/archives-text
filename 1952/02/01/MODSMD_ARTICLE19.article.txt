In the fall of '50 a plan was in
itiated which placer! entering fresh
men on the Dean's list, also. These
students must have a 3.8 high school
grade average.

Everyone on campus hears
about flic athletes who receive
trophies for superior skill, but
some students forget the
"brains" on campus are eligible
for awards, too.
At Stanford a trio of scholastic
honors is available.
First, the student may be selected
for membership in Phi Beta Kappa.
This national honor is conferred to
graduating seniors on college cam
puses where there are chapters.
Election to the organization is made
in the spring.
Ten per cent of the seniors are
eligible, but, seven or eight per cent
are usually elected each yea', ac
| cording to Dr. Thomas S. Barclay, of
the Political Science Department,
who is secretary of the Stanford
Phi Beta Kappa chapter.
To qualify a student must have a
minimum 15.25 Stanford average,
over a IV Work completed the first
six quarters and durins the last
live quarters is weighed equally.
Transfer students who have been
in residence at Stanford for at least
five quarters and whose transfer
average and Stanford average are
sufficiently high are not excluded
I from the organization.

One of the features nf commence
ment week is the initiation ami din
ner Riven in honor of the new Ph
Beta Kappa member's. Tbf society
which dates back to 177f>, has as it?
motto "Friendship, Literature, and
Morality."
Phi Beta activities on campus arc
governed by an executive council
made up of live faculty members and
three representatives, including two
recent, graduates. Dr. Philip VV.
Harsh of the Classics Department, is
president of the campus Phi Beta
Kappa group.
A second plan for honoring su
perior students is the graduation
with distinction plan. In IMa.v the.
Scholarship Committee, at present
headed by l)r. Raymond llarrimnn,
receives a list of the graduating

seniors who rank in tin* top IS per
cent in each of the seven general
department groupings.
This total is made up of student?
enrolled in languages and human! -
tie?, biological physical and
mineral sciences, social science -, en
gineering, education, law classifica
tions.
(ireat distinction is awarded to the
highe: I 5 per cent in each group
These students have made a mini
mum grade point average of .'5.150. or
better, in their upper division work.
The remaining 10 per cent who must
have a minimum average of 3.0, or
better, on UD work, are graduated
with distinction. In addition these
students must have a B average on
their total Stanford record.
The minimum required grade,

however, is not always high enough
(<» earn a place for the student on
the graduation awards list The He
termining factor is the cahbei of
Evades made by the rest of the
stndents in hi', department.
For instance, the 5 per cent might
bold fiom 3.7 to 4 0 grade point
averages, thus the student who made
a 3 5 averaee and who ordinarily
would be eligible for great distinction
honors would be lowered into the
distinction group.
In another case, if a student makes
A's in his lower division work, but
falls to C plus work, in his junior and
senior years. still totaling over a B,
he would not be eligibl" to graduate
with honors because bis last two
years wot I; was deficient, explains
Mr-;. Olivia Bylcr, secretary of the
Scholarship Committee.

A third academic plan at Stanford
is the Dean's list which is a cempi'a
| tion of all undergraduates who have
made a 3.5 average or better. The
list, which was first published in the
fall of '40, is compiled ea< h Octobei
and figured on the basis of grades re
ceived during the preceding autumn,
winter, and spring quarters.
In the fall of '50 a plan was in
itiated which placer! entering fresh
men on the Dean's list, also. These
students must have a 3.8 high school
grade average.
