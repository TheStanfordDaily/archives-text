services in the seven months ending June 30, but said there still
will be enough left to start UMT "immediately."
Hershey, who said previously he no longer is "pessimistic"

about manpower picture, told
the House Armed Services Commit

able for the draft in the seven
month period. He said this means
900,620 will be left after the armed
forces' needs are met.
The Selective Service ctiicf tes
tified as the committee end"d

itary Training and prepare-I to go
into cloned session Monday to

The Defense Department wants to
start U'MT as soon as possible with
18-year-old youths, giving them six
months' training and then taking
them into the reserves for 'iVz years
or placing them on active duty for
18 months.

tee was leaning toward the plan
under which the youths would be
placed in the reserve instead.
