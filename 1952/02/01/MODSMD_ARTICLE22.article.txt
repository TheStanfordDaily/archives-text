# Indians Will Cross 66ers' Trail
## Kurland Big Gun 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's basketball team will
face the toughest competition
any collegiate team could pos
sibly have tomorrow night,
when they host the top amateur
outfit in the country, the Phillips
66ers.
The 66ers, commonly known as the
Oilers, boast a 32-1 record, the one
defeat coming at the hands of the
Peoria Caterpillar Diesels. Count
ing this season, they have compiled
a record of 689 and 78 in 16 years.
They have won the National AAU
crown eight times; finished second
twice; and third, three times. Last
year, however, the Stewart Chevro
lets defeated them 66-63 in a triple
overtime in the final round of the
tournament.
Their big gun this year, as he
has been ever since he joined the
team, is 7-foot Bob Kurland, a
former All-Time collegiate All-
Amcrican collegiate AU-American
at Oklahoma A. & M., holds the
AAU seasonal scoring record of
787 points. He made the AAU All-
American team every one of tho
five years he has been with the
Oilers, and has led them to three
championships.
At Oklahoma A. & M., Big Bob
was a three-year All-American,
making Helms Player of the Year in
1946 and leading the national scoring
with 643 points. His best output that
year was 58 scored against St. Louis.
Starting at the forwards will be
Wayne Glasgow (6'3") and Ken
Pryor (5'11"). Glasgow, a two-year
All-Big-Seven selection at Okla
homa, is playing his second year with
Phillips. He is a hard driver and a
good passer.
Pryor, the shortest member of the
team, is in his third year. He made
the AAU All-American team last
year and was All-Big Seven for three
years at Oklahoma. He has a tine
set shot, and his accurate passes lead
many a fast break*
Playing one guard will be 6'9"
Bus Whitehead, a two-year All-
Big-Seven selection at Nebraska.
The 235-pounder holds five indi
vidual records at Nebraska, and
played on the West AU-Stars in
1950. He is one ot the best re
bounders in the game today.


SHORT 'N SNAPPY—OIeg Suzdaleff, 5'11" fiery Card guard,
makes up for his height with his speed and sparkling ball
handling. "Ollic" is an excellent playmaker and is an impoitant
cog in the Indians' attack. However, tomorrow night will pro
vide some entertaining moments if Suzdaleff ever goes up for
a tip with 7-foot Bob Kurland.
Rounding out the starting five is
G'2" Bob Likens, a rookie. The for
mer Oklahoma Baptist flash possesses
a deadly eye and can be counted on
for at least 10 points a game.
Other Oilers who are likely to see
plenty of action against the Cards
Saturday are Loy Doty, a 6'3" for
ward from Wyoming; Claude Hou
chin, a G's" rebounding specialist
from Kansas; Bill Kleine, Bob Kur
land's G'10" substitute; Paul Courty,
a G'3" three-year All-Big-Seven se
lection at Oklahoma; Jim Line, who
was the fifth man on the great Beard-
Croza-Bai ker-Jones team at Ken
tucky three years ago; Lloyd Hen
drix, a fiery little guard from Hous
ton; and Bob Pierce, G'7", a great all
around athlete, at Nebraska last year.
The 13 squad members of the
Oilers average G'4M»" in height,Mo
fonn one of the tallest teams in
Phillips history.
Their coach is Jesse "Cab" Renick,
an all-time Phillips great. Renick, a
full-blooded Choctaw, is a former
Ail-American at Oklahoma A. & M.
and made the AAU All-American
twice with the Phillips. Under his
tutelage, the Oilers have
compiled a record of 185 victories and
10 losses. He piloted them to the
AAU crown in 1950, and is well on
his way to duplicating that achieve
ment again this year.
Stanford coach Bob Burnett plans
to start the same lineup that was so
successful against San Jose State
Wednesday. To captain Jim Ram
stead goes the almost impossible task
of stopping Kurland, who has seven
inches in height over Jim. The line
ups:
Glasgow (G'3") F (.I'll" Tomsic
Pryor (G'l 1") F (G'l") Tucker
Kurland (7'0") C (G's") Ramstead
Whitehead («'!)") G (G'4") Walsh
Likens (G'2") G (5'11") Suzdaleff


ROUGH AND READY is the Oilers 6'9"-235 pound guard, Bus
Whitehead. Bus, one of the greatest rebounders in the game
today, is playing his second season with the Oilers. A two-year
All-Big-Seven choice at Nebraska, Bus can be counted on to
give the Cards a rough evening Saturday.

overtime in the final round of the
tournament.
Their big gun this year, as he
has been ever since he joined the
team, is 7-foot Bob Kurland, a
former All-Time collegiate All-
Amcrican collegiate AU-American
at Oklahoma A. & M., holds the
AAU seasonal scoring record of
787 points. He made the AAU All-
American team every one of tho
five years he has been with the
Oilers, and has led them to three
championships.
At Oklahoma A. & M., Big Bob
was a three-year All-American,
making Helms Player of the Year in
1946 and leading the national scoring
with 643 points. His best output that
year was 58 scored against St. Louis.
Starting at the forwards will be
Wayne Glasgow (6'3") and Ken
Pryor (5'11"). Glasgow, a two-year
All-Big-Seven selection at Okla
homa, is playing his second year with
Phillips. He is a hard driver and a
good passer.
Pryor, the shortest member of the
team, is in his third year. He made
the AAU All-American team last
year and was All-Big Seven for three
years at Oklahoma. He has a tine
set shot, and his accurate passes lead
many a fast break*
Playing one guard will be 6'9"
Bus Whitehead, a two-year All-
Big-Seven selection at Nebraska.
The 235-pounder holds five indi
vidual records at Nebraska, and
played on the West AU-Stars in
1950. He is one ot the best re
bounders in the game today.


SHORT 'N SNAPPY—OIeg Suzdaleff, 5'11" fiery Card guard,
makes up for his height with his speed and sparkling ball
handling. "Ollic" is an excellent playmaker and is an impoitant
cog in the Indians' attack. However, tomorrow night will pro
vide some entertaining moments if Suzdaleff ever goes up for
a tip with 7-foot Bob Kurland.
Rounding out the starting five is
G'2" Bob Likens, a rookie. The for
mer Oklahoma Baptist flash possesses
a deadly eye and can be counted on
for at least 10 points a game.
Other Oilers who are likely to see
plenty of action against the Cards
Saturday are Loy Doty, a 6'3" for
ward from Wyoming; Claude Hou
chin, a G's" rebounding specialist
from Kansas; Bill Kleine, Bob Kur
land's G'10" substitute; Paul Courty,
a G'3" three-year All-Big-Seven se
lection at Oklahoma; Jim Line, who
was the fifth man on the great Beard-
Croza-Bai ker-Jones team at Ken
tucky three years ago; Lloyd Hen
drix, a fiery little guard from Hous
ton; and Bob Pierce, G'7", a great all
around athlete, at Nebraska last year.
The 13 squad members of the
Oilers average G'4M»" in height,Mo
fonn one of the tallest teams in
Phillips history.
Their coach is Jesse "Cab" Renick,
an all-time Phillips great. Renick, a
full-blooded Choctaw, is a former
Ail-American at Oklahoma A. & M.
and made the AAU All-American
twice with the Phillips. Under his
tutelage, the Oilers have
compiled a record of 185 victories and
10 losses. He piloted them to the
AAU crown in 1950, and is well on
his way to duplicating that achieve
ment again this year.
Stanford coach Bob Burnett plans
to start the same lineup that was so
successful against San Jose State
Wednesday. To captain Jim Ram
stead goes the almost impossible task
of stopping Kurland, who has seven
inches in height over Jim. The line
ups:
Glasgow (G'3") F (.I'll" Tomsic
Pryor (G'l 1") F (G'l") Tucker
Kurland (7'0") C (G's") Ramstead
Whitehead («'!)") G (G'4") Walsh
Likens (G'2") G (5'11") Suzdaleff


ROUGH AND READY is the Oilers 6'9"-235 pound guard, Bus
Whitehead. Bus, one of the greatest rebounders in the game
today, is playing his second season with the Oilers. A two-year
All-Big-Seven choice at Nebraska, Bus can be counted on to
give the Cards a rough evening Saturday.
Stanford's basketball team will
face the toughest competition
any collegiate team could pos
sibly have tomorrow night,
when they host the top amateur
outfit in the country, the Phillips
66ers.
The 66ers, commonly known as the
Oilers, boast a 32-1 record, the one
defeat coming at the hands of the
Peoria Caterpillar Diesels. Count
ing this season, they have compiled
a record of 689 and 78 in 16 years.

year was 58 scored against St. Louis.
Starting at the forwards will be
Wayne Glasgow (6'3") and Ken
Pryor (5'11"). Glasgow, a two-year
All-Big-Seven selection at Okla
homa, is playing his second year with
Phillips. He is a hard driver and a
good passer.
Pryor, the shortest member of the
team, is in his third year. He made
the AAU All-American team last
year and was All-Big Seven for three
years at Oklahoma. He has a tine
set shot, and his accurate passes lead
many a fast break*
Playing one guard will be 6'9"
Bus Whitehead, a two-year All-
Big-Seven selection at Nebraska.
The 235-pounder holds five indi
vidual records at Nebraska, and
played on the West AU-Stars in
1950. He is one ot the best re
bounders in the game today.


SHORT 'N SNAPPY—OIeg Suzdaleff, 5'11" fiery Card guard,
makes up for his height with his speed and sparkling ball
handling. "Ollic" is an excellent playmaker and is an impoitant
cog in the Indians' attack. However, tomorrow night will pro
vide some entertaining moments if Suzdaleff ever goes up for
a tip with 7-foot Bob Kurland.
Rounding out the starting five is
G'2" Bob Likens, a rookie. The for
mer Oklahoma Baptist flash possesses
a deadly eye and can be counted on
for at least 10 points a game.
Other Oilers who are likely to see
plenty of action against the Cards
Saturday are Loy Doty, a 6'3" for
ward from Wyoming; Claude Hou
chin, a G's" rebounding specialist
from Kansas; Bill Kleine, Bob Kur
land's G'10" substitute; Paul Courty,
a G'3" three-year All-Big-Seven se
lection at Oklahoma; Jim Line, who
was the fifth man on the great Beard-
Croza-Bai ker-Jones team at Ken
tucky three years ago; Lloyd Hen
drix, a fiery little guard from Hous
ton; and Bob Pierce, G'7", a great all
around athlete, at Nebraska last year.
The 13 squad members of the
Oilers average G'4M»" in height,Mo
fonn one of the tallest teams in
Phillips history.
Their coach is Jesse "Cab" Renick,
an all-time Phillips great. Renick, a
full-blooded Choctaw, is a former
Ail-American at Oklahoma A. & M.
and made the AAU All-American
twice with the Phillips. Under his
tutelage, the Oilers have
compiled a record of 185 victories and
10 losses. He piloted them to the
AAU crown in 1950, and is well on
his way to duplicating that achieve
ment again this year.
Stanford coach Bob Burnett plans
to start the same lineup that was so
successful against San Jose State
Wednesday. To captain Jim Ram
stead goes the almost impossible task
of stopping Kurland, who has seven
inches in height over Jim. The line
ups:
Glasgow (G'3") F (.I'll" Tomsic
Pryor (G'l 1") F (G'l") Tucker
Kurland (7'0") C (G's") Ramstead
Whitehead («'!)") G (G'4") Walsh
Likens (G'2") G (5'11") Suzdaleff


ROUGH AND READY is the Oilers 6'9"-235 pound guard, Bus
Whitehead. Bus, one of the greatest rebounders in the game
today, is playing his second season with the Oilers. A two-year
All-Big-Seven choice at Nebraska, Bus can be counted on to
give the Cards a rough evening Saturday.
Stanford's basketball team will
face the toughest competition
any collegiate team could pos
sibly have tomorrow night,
when they host the top amateur
outfit in the country, the Phillips
66ers.
The 66ers, commonly known as the
Oilers, boast a 32-1 record, the one
defeat coming at the hands of the
Peoria Caterpillar Diesels. Count
ing this season, they have compiled
a record of 689 and 78 in 16 years.
They have won the National AAU
crown eight times; finished second
twice; and third, three times. Last
year, however, the Stewart Chevro
lets defeated them 66-63 in a triple
overtime in the final round of the
tournament.
Their big gun this year, as he
has been ever since he joined the
team, is 7-foot Bob Kurland, a
former All-Time collegiate All-
Amcrican collegiate AU-American
at Oklahoma A. & M., holds the
AAU seasonal scoring record of
787 points. He made the AAU All-
American team every one of tho
five years he has been with the
Oilers, and has led them to three
championships.
At Oklahoma A. & M., Big Bob
was a three-year All-American,
making Helms Player of the Year in
