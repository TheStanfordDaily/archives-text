# Indians Will Cross 66ers' Trail
## Kurland Big Gun 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford's basketball team will
face the toughest competition
any collegiate team could pos
sibly have tomorrow night,
when they host the top amateur
outfit in the country, the Phillips
66ers.
The 66ers, commonly known as the
Oilers, boast a 32-1 record, the one
defeat coming at the hands of the
Peoria Caterpillar Diesels. Count
ing this season, they have compiled
a record of 689 and 78 in 16 years.
They have won the National AAU
crown eight times; finished second
twice; and third, three times. Last
year, however, the Stewart Chevro
lets defeated them 66-63 in a triple
overtime in the final round of the
tournament.
Their big gun this year, as he
has been ever since he joined the
team, is 7-foot Bob Kurland, a
former All-Time collegiate All-
Amcrican collegiate AU-American
at Oklahoma A. & M., holds the
AAU seasonal scoring record of
787 points. He made the AAU All-
American team every one of tho
five years he has been with the
Oilers, and has led them to three
championships.
At Oklahoma A. & M., Big Bob
was a three-year All-American,
making Helms Player of the Year in
1946 and leading the national scoring
with 643 points. His best output that
year was 58 scored against St. Louis.
Starting at the forwards will be
Wayne Glasgow (6'3") and Ken
Pryor (5'11"). Glasgow, a two-year
All-Big-Seven selection at Okla
homa, is playing his second year with
Phillips. He is a hard driver and a
good passer.
Pryor, the shortest member of the
team, is in his third year. He made
the AAU All-American team last
year and was All-Big Seven for three
years at Oklahoma. He has a tine
set shot, and his accurate passes lead
many a fast break*
Playing one guard will be 6'9"
Bus Whitehead, a two-year All-
Big-Seven selection at Nebraska.
The 235-pounder holds five indi
vidual records at Nebraska, and
played on the West AU-Stars in
1950. He is one ot the best re
bounders in the game today.


SHORT 'N SNAPPY—OIeg Suzdaleff, 5'11" fiery Card guard,
makes up for his height with his speed and sparkling ball
handling. "Ollic" is an excellent playmaker and is an impoitant
cog in the Indians' attack. However, tomorrow night will pro
vide some entertaining moments if Suzdaleff ever goes up for
a tip with 7-foot Bob Kurland.
