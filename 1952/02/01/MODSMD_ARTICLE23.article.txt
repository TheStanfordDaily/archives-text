# B. of E. Dismisses Two Complaints
## 
### 
The State Board of Equalization
dismissed accusations against two
Middlefield Road beer and wine es
tablishments yesterday, declaring
they were more than a mile and a
half away from Stanford by road.
The penal code, based on two
similar cases, states that the dis
tance from Stanford shall be meas
ured by car travel rather than air
line distance.
Complaints had been filed against
Marie and Herman Ehrich of 2849
Middlefield and Adam A. Schmicrer
of 2775 Middlefield Road.
Objections referred to the near
ness of the establishments to Hoo
ver School, but the B. of E. skipped
over this, basing its dismissal on
proximity to Stanford.
