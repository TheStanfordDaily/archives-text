# Just Before the Last 'Thirty'

### 
The office typewriter is daring me to punch
out the three oh mark in a hurry and wrap up
old Volume 120. But you don't wrap up 70
issues of the Peninsula's Only Mominq News
paper without a few last thoughts.
For instance, the Rose Bowl, which like it or
not, was the biggest newsbreak of the past four
and a half months. I remember The Daily the
Monday after the SC game when the biggest
headline type we could find blared out "Eight
in a Row—Future Rosy." Then came the two
tough losses to Cat and Illinois and we were
glad to forget football.
A hassle over language requirements for
lower division students kept the paper full for
a few weeks. A fight for recognition by the
Young Republicans was started, and it still
hangs in the balance, an issue with a hundred
touchy angles.
For some reason 1 remember a bee trap
baited with poison liver and a football car
toon that got lost betv/een the San Jose en
graving plant and here.
There was a big fuss made about the liquor
lav/ for minors which ended with Excom recom
mending a lov/ering of the legal drinking age

to 18. There was a very damp week of storms
and floods. There were the usual C3mpu3 fra
ternity pranks, and there was a fine gesture by
the ATO's to start a "help week." I'd sort of
forgotten about that. Wonder if other fraterni
ties here wiil follow the lead?
I could wonder on the typewriter about a
lot of other matters too. Ws just now, when
I'm doing a little retrospective thinking for
the first time in months, that the many events
of the year connect themselves a little and fit
into some soit of perspective.
But rather than wonder about these matters,
I'll cut this short. It's time to start looking for
ward to Monday's paper, just another Daily to
most of the campus, perhaps, but Volume 121,
number one for you, lack and Sue.
As for advice, an old formula for these last
gasp editorials, just this: put out the best paper
you're capable of producing, play fair and have
fun. On all three scores i have no doubts what
ever, because it's been the privileqe o( Bob,
Helen and myself to work with you and your
staff. We know you as wonderful friends and
good newspaper workers.
Enough reminiscing, but not before a gen
uinely sincere "Good Luck!"— Gordon.
