# Vocational Aid Is Part of Education
## 
### 
In yesterday's issue, The Daily printed one
of the most significant stories of this rapidly
ending volume—the news that no vocational
guidance talks are scheduled for this year.
The story was important because, to recite
the most obvious of platitudes, employment is
important to every college student; important
because ioo many freshmen, sophomores,
juniors, and seniors flounder about for a large
part of their college life without any chosen
occupation in mind.
The vocational guidance talks were originally
pointed toward the freshmen, but they failed
because of insufficient interest. Then success
ful businessmen were invited to tell seniors
about the opportunities in various occupations,
but again they failed and for the same reason.
Why? Certainly no student is too busy with
his studies or with his social life that he cannot
take the time to learn from men currently in
the business and professional world what pro

fessors cannot tell him about present day oc
cupational conditions.
And, needless to say, a knowledge of such
conditions will certainly aid the uncertain stu
dent in making his choice of vocation, as well
as dissuading him from entering a field about
which he may have had romantic but false
ideas.
Placement Service Director Eugene Dils has
left the door open for vocational talks this year
by promising if enough men we re to ask that
talks be held, they could still be arranged.
We urge all interested men, and women too,
especially freshmen, to get together and sub
mit such a reguest to the Placement Service.
We say freshmen because the eailier a student
can decide on his life work, the better he can
orient his courses in accordance with that ob
jective. But we feel the talks should also be
open to upper classmen who are still shopping
around for a career.—B B.
