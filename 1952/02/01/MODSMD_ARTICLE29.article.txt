# BULL SESSION
## 
### DICK McLEAN 
SURPRISE

This Bull Session is planned to be a bigger surprise
than you think. Usually half the Daily staff sees the
B.S. (that's what they call it) before it even gets to
the printers. But this time it's going to be different.
And how! No one on The Daily is going to see this
until it's irrevocably into type and beyond range of
their greedy erasures. With the help of my good
friends—those stalwart men—the printers, this column
is coins' to bp a laueh nn Thp Stanford „

Kuuig iu up a on ine otari.
First, let me say that I'm not a
member of The Daily staff. I'm
a contributor and spend about
twenty minutes a week in the
"Shack." But with what I see
cf these characters in that time
I've get enough material to write
another Dante's "Inferno."
And hell it is. That Daily Shack.
Hell and bedlam all rolled up to
gether. There ai e three miracles
each day at Stanford: the dawn,

that anybody gets up at 8 o'clock, and that that bunch
of wonderful idiots are able to hit enough keys on
their typewriters to produce a semblance of a news
paper.
But (he real story of The Daily is (he story of its
personalities. Nowhere except in the psycho ward
at the health service will you find such a conglomer
ation. The Shack is stacked with them.
Heading the list is Jack McDonald, the new editor.
Poor, poor old "Scoop." It's not that lie's really thick.
It's just that he's got a lot on his mind. To tell him
something important you've got to find him first.
(He hides.) Then you grasp him firmly by the shoul
ders and say, "Scoop, it's me, Dick. Do you hear me?"
He's likely to answer, "Sure, Jim. But make sure it
fills a page." You tell him what you've got to say and
then make him repeat it twice. Then you leave a
memorandum and hope that his secretary will find it.
If he takes his pills like the doctor tells him to, he
hardly twitches at all.
Gordy McKibhen, the outgoing editor, is a sad
example of whnt happens when a normal person
volunteers to he superintendent at the "Snake Pit."
Now after four years Gordy is going. Hair pre
maturely white, shorn of his former robust frame,
he returns to his metropolis home of KJrkland,
Washington to sleep the good sleep.
To the unaccustomed eyes the sleek and exotic

form of Sue Goodstein (rhymes with goodtime) is a
little jarring. Here can be seen the example of a
girl blessed with both brains and beauty who worked
herself up the easy way. Sue is the new managing
editor and should do rather well—managing.
Mother Jean MaltseiT, who writes the ' Who's in
in the Rest Home" items, is a good friend to all. Out
side of her writing Mother Jean takes care of public
relations, the children of Daily staff writers, inter
office communication, soothing in general, and Scoop's
pills.
The swarthy Jimmy Ratlin is one of the strangest
specimens to be found pecking at a typewriter, lie's
normal except for one quirk. He thinks hi;; first name
is Bob. Poor fellow. No one seems to be able to
convince him otherwise.
Another familiar character is Peter Grothe (pro
nounced growth) who is constantly seen reading old
Bull Sessions changing a word or two here, u by
line there.
Farl Odel) and the rest of the sports writers are so
violent that they had to build a rail around their par
ticular section of the office. Among the most dan -
gerous of the sportswriters is Paul Zimmerman. It
was "Zimbo" who started the erroneous story (via
the tidbit snatching Peter Grothe) thai found with*
reprint in the San Francisco anil local pr< ;. On one
of his less imaginative days he poured art poison into
Sue Goodstein's stein and lighter fluid into Kollo
Klein's beer. "To kill the anty bodies and tjve Hollo
a flaming rum Burgermeister," lie explained. (This
really happened.)
And many others: Moneybags Mazzoni, who
worries all the time; the cosmopolitan Dorothy
Dodge of Susanville; Helen Kessel of bathing suit
lame; Walt Menninger of the psychoticVlenningers;
liick Schwarz who takes pictures: Ruhy Bernstein
ot the famous fish grotto family; (.any Cahn, who
can't; and a freshman named Ann.
About the other things, the perpetual graft, moral
corruption and unorthodox practices (once when the
teletype machine broke down, they inv< nted the*
news) I'll say nothing. About the lewd treatment of
freshmen lovelies I'll say nothing either. About the
peculiarities of the staff, there aren't enough word;?.
But,if you're normal and thinking ot working on The
Stanford Daily, don't.
I hope The Daily has as much fun reading this Bull
Session as I have writing it. If so, see you next week.
If not, goodbye.

SURPRISE

This Bull Session is planned to be a bigger surprise
than you think. Usually half the Daily staff sees the
B.S. (that's what they call it) before it even gets to
the printers. But this time it's going to be different.
And how! No one on The Daily is going to see this
until it's irrevocably into type and beyond range of
their greedy erasures. With the help of my good
friends—those stalwart men—the printers, this column

First, let me say that I'm not a
member of The Daily staff. I'm
a contributor and spend about
twenty minutes a week in the
"Shack." But with what I see
cf these characters in that time
I've get enough material to write
another Dante's "Inferno."
And hell it is. That Daily Shack.
Hell and bedlam all rolled up to
gether. There ai e three miracles
each day at Stanford: the dawn,

that anybody gets up at 8 o'clock, and that that bunch
of wonderful idiots are able to hit enough keys on
their typewriters to produce a semblance of a news
paper.
But (he real story of The Daily is (he story of its
personalities. Nowhere except in the psycho ward
at the health service will you find such a conglomer
ation. The Shack is stacked with them.
Heading the list is Jack McDonald, the new editor.
Poor, poor old "Scoop." It's not that lie's really thick.
It's just that he's got a lot on his mind. To tell him
something important you've got to find him first.

SURPRISE

This Bull Session is planned to be a bigger surprise
than you think. Usually half the Daily staff sees the
B.S. (that's what they call it) before it even gets to
the printers. But this time it's going to be different.
And how! No one on The Daily is going to see this
until it's irrevocably into type and beyond range of
their greedy erasures. With the help of my good
friends—those stalwart men—the printers, this column
is coins' to bp a laueh nn Thp Stanford „

First, let me say that I'm not a
member of The Daily staff. I'm
a contributor and spend about
twenty minutes a week in the
"Shack." But with what I see
cf these characters in that time
I've get enough material to write
another Dante's "Inferno."
And hell it is. That Daily Shack.
Hell and bedlam all rolled up to
gether. There ai e three miracles
each day at Stanford: the dawn,

that anybody gets up at 8 o'clock, and that that bunch
of wonderful idiots are able to hit enough keys on
their typewriters to produce a semblance of a news
paper.
But (he real story of The Daily is (he story of its
personalities. Nowhere except in the psycho ward
at the health service will you find such a conglomer
ation. The Shack is stacked with them.
Heading the list is Jack McDonald, the new editor.
Poor, poor old "Scoop." It's not that lie's really thick.
It's just that he's got a lot on his mind. To tell him
something important you've got to find him first.
(He hides.) Then you grasp him firmly by the shoul
ders and say, "Scoop, it's me, Dick. Do you hear me?"
He's likely to answer, "Sure, Jim. But make sure it
fills a page." You tell him what you've got to say and
then make him repeat it twice. Then you leave a
memorandum and hope that his secretary will find it.
If he takes his pills like the doctor tells him to, he
hardly twitches at all.
Gordy McKibhen, the outgoing editor, is a sad
example of whnt happens when a normal person
volunteers to he superintendent at the "Snake Pit."
Now after four years Gordy is going. Hair pre
maturely white, shorn of his former robust frame,
he returns to his metropolis home of KJrkland,
Washington to sleep the good sleep.
To the unaccustomed eyes the sleek and exotic

form of Sue Goodstein (rhymes with goodtime) is a
little jarring. Here can be seen the example of a
girl blessed with both brains and beauty who worked
herself up the easy way. Sue is the new managing
editor and should do rather well—managing.
Mother Jean MaltseiT, who writes the ' Who's in
in the Rest Home" items, is a good friend to all. Out
side of her writing Mother Jean takes care of public
relations, the children of Daily staff writers, inter
office communication, soothing in general, and Scoop's
pills.
The swarthy Jimmy Ratlin is one of the strangest
specimens to be found pecking at a typewriter, lie's
normal except for one quirk. He thinks hi;; first name
is Bob. Poor fellow. No one seems to be able to
convince him otherwise.
Another familiar character is Peter Grothe (pro
nounced growth) who is constantly seen reading old
Bull Sessions changing a word or two here, u by
line there.
