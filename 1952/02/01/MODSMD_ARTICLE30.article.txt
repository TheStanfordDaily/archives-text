To the Editor:
We have a very serious matter to discuss—some
thing that is on the minds of almost all students but
is seldom brought into the cold light of public view—
namely, the boy-meet-girl affair, which is a very
distressful situation to students who don't belong to
social organizations here at Stanford.
We would like to propose "mixer" dances on one
night each weekend as have been organized so
successfully in numerous other universities in the
I'nited States and abroad. The few that have been
held here at Stanford have been very succssful
also.

These dances have met with such great nuccesn in
some universities that it is common practice for many
students not to date on these evenings and go stag
to these dances, and this situation might conceivably
arise here at Stanford. However, our main idea is to
have a place where Stanford students may come and
meet others at an informal dam e or "mixer." Hoping
that something will come of tin , issue or that further
.suggestions will be proferred.
