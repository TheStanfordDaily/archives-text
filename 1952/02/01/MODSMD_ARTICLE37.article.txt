meda, Cal, San Jose, and a first in
the AAU meet held in Berkeley two
weeks ago, will wrestle all comers
in the 107-pound class.

Jose and Cal Poly will field strong
teams, and Washington State is the

tremendous little 130-pounder, will
have to continue in this state for
the remainder of the season. Lyons,
suffering from a bad shoulder, is out

Cougars, Spartans, Cal Poly Strong
As for their opponents, both San
Jose and Cal Poly will field strong
teams, and Washington State is the
cla.is of the Northwest. The Cou
gars are perennially strong in the
heavyweights and in the 130-pound
and 137-pound classes, and should
be a definite threat to the California
schools.
The varsity, so far operating
without the services of Olie Lyons,
tremendous little 130-pounder, will
have to continue in this state for
the remainder of the season. Lyons,
suffering from a bad shoulder, is out
for the season for fear of permanent
damage.
Stanford's injury - ridden wres
tling team travels down El Carnino
tomorrow to meet five strong teams
in San Jose State's gym. San Jose
will host Stanford, Washington
State, Cal Poly, San Francisco
State ,and Santa Clara in a series
of five dual meets.
Stanford will meet three separate
teams Saturday night, beginning at
7:30, and will play the other two
Monday night. This is not a tour
nament, but five separate meets.
Coach Don Williams will use
chunky Phil Wilson in the heavy
weight department; and Jack Ogels
fcy, recovered from a recent illness,
will hold down the 177-pound spot.
Ron Garner, who usually alternates
with sophomore Wilson in the
heavyweight class, is out with a
cold and won't see action over the
weekend.
Madden Unbeaten at 167
Put Madden, undefeated frosh
sensation fresh from wins over Ala
meda, Cal, San Jose, and a first in
the AAU meet held in Berkeley two
weeks ago, will wrestle all comers
in the 107-pound class.
Ken James, another tough man,
will wrestle in the 157-pound class,
and Bob Jessen is expected to go in
the 147-pound class. Jessen, unfor
tunately, hurt his neck in an auto
mobile accident this week, but is
expected to be well enough to par
ticipate by tomorrow night.
George Russell, who racked up
Stanford's only pin against San Jose
last week, will start for Stanford
in the 137 - pound class, and Bob
Neighbor, a junior out for wrestling
for the first time, will wrestle in the
130-pound class. Neighbor shows a
lot of spirit to come out as he has
for the first time, but still is a little
short on experience.
