Featured in this week's Sat- 1
urday Evening Po3t is Stanford's
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, professor
of education and psychology,
emeritus.
In an article titled "So That's !
What Happens to Child Prodigies," :
Milton and Margaret Silverman,
close friends of Dr. Terman and res
idents of Menlo Park, have told of
Terman's work in the 'field of men
tally gifted children, and have de
bunked some of the cherished su
perstitions about precocious chil
dren.
In an interview with Dr. Terman,
it was learned that the Silvermans
had known of his work in the field
of mentally superior children and
had written the article last Novem
ber. Terman, who in more than 40
years at Stanford has built the
Psychology Department into one of
the best in the country, wdl cele
brate his 75th birthday this year.
His Interest in Prodigies
Dr. Terman said he became inter
ested in the field of precocious chil
dren when he wrote his Doctor's
dissertation on a study of intelli
gence tests.. "I even made some up
and used them on groups of boys,"
he said.
Dr. Terman had read all the ar
ticles that the famed French psy
chologist Binet had published and
had studied various tests used by
German phychologists. When Binet
published his controversial tests in

1908, "I naturally wanted to get
busy as soon as possible."
However, until he came to Stan
ford Dr. Terman did little with his
work. Finally in 1916, six years
after coming to Stanford, he and
his co-workers issued the now-fa
mous Binet-Stanford aptitude test.
During the 1920s Dr. Terman and
his associates picked 1,500 of the
brightest children in the urban
areas of California. "San Francisco
and Los Angeles ran about even,"
he mused. Since that time Dr. Ter
man and his field workers have fol
lowed them through life, issuing
comprehensive reports at intervals,
the next of which will be ready for
the presses "probably at the end of
1953."
Some interesting notes on his
studies were given by Dr. Terman.
"it w.:s not uncommon to find two
children in a family with IQ's which
would qualify them for the group.
In fact, one family of Japanese-
Americans contributed five children
for the study," he said.
Dr. Terman also stated that a far
larger percentage than would nor
mally be expected of a random
group of 1,500 have entered profes
sional fields. "For example," he
said, "you might expect to find three
or four doctors and lawyers in a
similar-sized group, but of the ones
we selected there arc 52 doctors and
85 lawyers."
He also said that 75 were on fac
ulties of various schools. Asked if
any were collegc presidents, Dr.
Terman laughed and said, "Not.
yet." Children with an IQ of 140
and up were the ones selected for
the experiment.
Dr. Terman stirred up the great
est furor when he advocated special
training for students with excep
tional IQ's. "It wouldn't necessarily

net them into high school earlier,
but would provide them with an en
riched curriculum—a type of inde
pendent study," He said.
Although the children were origi
nally from California, Dr. Ternian
stated that now they are scattered
all over the world. "There are
about a do/en children of members
of the original group attending
Stanford right now, mo .tly in their
first two years," he concluded.

ford Dr. Terman did little with his
work. Finally in 1916, six years
after coming to Stanford, he and
his co-workers issued the now-fa
mous Binet-Stanford aptitude test.
During the 1920s Dr. Terman and
his associates picked 1,500 of the
brightest children in the urban
areas of California. "San Francisco
and Los Angeles ran about even,"
he mused. Since that time Dr. Ter
man and his field workers have fol
lowed them through life, issuing
comprehensive reports at intervals,
the next of which will be ready for
the presses "probably at the end of
1953."
Some interesting notes on his
studies were given by Dr. Terman.
"it w.:s not uncommon to find two
children in a family with IQ's which
would qualify them for the group.
In fact, one family of Japanese-
Americans contributed five children
for the study," he said.
Dr. Terman also stated that a far
larger percentage than would nor
mally be expected of a random
group of 1,500 have entered profes
sional fields. "For example," he
said, "you might expect to find three
or four doctors and lawyers in a
similar-sized group, but of the ones
we selected there arc 52 doctors and
85 lawyers."
He also said that 75 were on fac
ulties of various schools. Asked if
any were collegc presidents, Dr.
Terman laughed and said, "Not.
yet." Children with an IQ of 140
and up were the ones selected for
the experiment.
Dr. Terman stirred up the great
est furor when he advocated special
training for students with excep
tional IQ's. "It wouldn't necessarily

net them into high school earlier,
but would provide them with an en
riched curriculum—a type of inde
pendent study," He said.
Although the children were origi
nally from California, Dr. Ternian
stated that now they are scattered
all over the world. "There are
about a do/en children of members
of the original group attending
Stanford right now, mo .tly in their
first two years," he concluded.

and used them on groups of boys,"
he said.
Dr. Terman had read all the ar

chologist Binet had published and
had studied various tests used by
German phychologists. When Binet
published his controversial tests in

1908, "I naturally wanted to get
