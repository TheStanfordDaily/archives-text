Spring Quarter, 1946, boredom and
thirst assembled the 1,000 strong
frosh class for the biggest blast of all
time.
Their thirst but not their boredom
assuaged, 100 Roble women and a
handful of Encina strong men took
each other on a tug-of-war. The co
eds treacherously tied their end of
the rope to a two-ton truck, and
dragged the confused men through
two feet of mud.
In 1047, the battling soplis won
by two points, in a weekend of
beard-growing contests, tire-pull
ing matches, chug-a-lugging from
baby bottle competitions, and en-,
tertainment rivalry.
In the following years, the trophy
changed hands many times. Coed
football games and tug-of-war con
tests were abolished, and a stag
dance added.
Last year, the Jamboree took on
a kidnapping trend. The frosh held
soph secretary Delight Kolar cap
tive at Roble, while frosh secre-.
tary Monica Verdumien was spir
ited away to Lag i>y the sopho-.
mores.
Miss Adele Strogen, chief counsel
or of women, stressed the point that

fun, but it is not supposed to be
