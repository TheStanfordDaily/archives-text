# Classy 66ers Outlast Cards
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford was the best basketball team in the country for 25
minutes and 20 seconds Saturday night.
In a game that was easily the year's best in the Pavilion, the
Cards succumbed to the mighty Phillips Oilers, 78-74, after leading
until the middle of the third quarter.
The game was tight right down to the wire as the men from

Bartlesville held a 75-74 lead with
21 seconds to go. Jim Walsh was
charged with a deliberate foul and
Claude Ilouchin made the first of
two free throws.
The Oilers waived the second,
and with 10 seconds to ,~o Wayne
Glasgow broke loose under the
bucket, made the layup, at.d
brought the score to 78-74. Stan
ford didn't have time to get ofi
a shot after that.
Jim Walsh was high point man in
ths game with 21, but it was Bob
Kurland, the Oilers' seven-foot cen
ter, who was the most impressive.
Kurland scored 20 until he fouled
out in the fourth quarter.
lie displayed a wide variety of
totally unguardable shots. Bob sank
nine out of the 14 he took, parsed
with accuracy and '-barpness, and
looked extremely impressive on ti.e
boards.
The thing that hurt t.he Cards
most, however, and what finally led
to their downfall was the Oilers'
ability to alternate ten men and,
with the exception of Kurland, suf
fer no loss in effectiveness.
Stanford, on tho other hand,
still stuck with the two - platoon
