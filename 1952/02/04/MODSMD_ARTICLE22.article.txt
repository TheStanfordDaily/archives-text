# Classy 66ers Outlast Cards
## 
### PAUL ZIMMERMAN 
Stanford was the best basketball team in the country for 25
minutes and 20 seconds Saturday night.
In a game that was easily the year's best in the Pavilion, the
Cards succumbed to the mighty Phillips Oilers, 78-74, after leading
until the middle of the third quarter.
The game was tight right down to the wire as the men from

Bartlesville held a 75-74 lead with
21 seconds to go. Jim Walsh was
charged with a deliberate foul and
Claude Ilouchin made the first of
two free throws.
The Oilers waived the second,
and with 10 seconds to ,~o Wayne
Glasgow broke loose under the
bucket, made the layup, at.d
brought the score to 78-74. Stan
ford didn't have time to get ofi
a shot after that.
Jim Walsh was high point man in
ths game with 21, but it was Bob
Kurland, the Oilers' seven-foot cen
ter, who was the most impressive.
Kurland scored 20 until he fouled
out in the fourth quarter.
lie displayed a wide variety of
totally unguardable shots. Bob sank
nine out of the 14 he took, parsed
with accuracy and '-barpness, and
looked extremely impressive on ti.e
boards.
The thing that hurt t.he Cards
most, however, and what finally led
to their downfall was the Oilers'
ability to alternate ten men and,
with the exception of Kurland, suf
fer no loss in effectiveness.
Stanford, on tho other hand,
still stuck with the two - platoon

second-stringers scored 10 them
selves, while allowing the Oilers
13.
The Cards led from the opening
moments, as Ed Tucke/ hit a free
throw to break the scoring ice. Sec
onds later Jim Walsh followed with
a jump shot from the side and Stan
ford had a 3-0 lead.
The scoring was even after that as
both teams hit with amazing regu
larity. Stanford held a slim lead
throughout, and was ahead 80-16
with two minutes remaining in the
quarter. At this point ,the second
Mring went in and the Oilers, eager
to get back in the game, narrowed
the score to 20-19.
The reserves started the second
quarter and this time they battled
the Phillips on even terms. A lay
up by Paul Courty gave the Oilers
a 25-24 lead, however, and at this
time Coach Eurnett rushed in the
well-re:.ted first-stringers.
'I lien followed one of the rnosf
flawless exhibitions of basketball
ever displayed by a Stanford (eain
on the Pavilion floor. After a
combined hook - jump shot b.v
Kurland, Stanford scored five
consecutive points on two field
goals and a free throw by Walsh.
Kurland knotted the count at 29-
iII v/ith two free throws, but the
Cards weren't to be denied. In the
next four minutes they scored 10
point; to the Oilei's' four, bringing
the half-time score to 39-33.
The capacity crowd at the Pavil
ion pinched themselves to see if
they were dreaming.
The Cards had brought the
mighty Oilers, top amateur team in
the country, to their knees. Out of
29 shots taken from the floor, Stan
ford had hit 15 for a phenomenal
.517 percentage. The Oilers, on the
other hand, had hit 14 out of 47
for a .298 mark.
Jim Ramstead was handling
himself admirably against a man
who had seven inches in height
over him. He had snagged seven
rebounds and had scored eight
points on four shots taken.

I The complexion changed in the
second half, however, as a steady
stream of Phillips reserves began to
wear down the Cards. Stanford
stretched their lead to eight points
at one time, but the Oilers brought
the count up to 49-43. They then
proceeded to score seven consecu
tive points on lay-ups by G-ft. 7
Bob Pierce and Wayne Glasgow, a
free throw by Glasgow, and a tip-in
by Kurland. The Cards were never
able to regain the lead after that.
They knotted the count at 50-all,
but the ever-fre h Phillips reserves,
combined with the height of Kur
land, G-ft. 9-in. Bus Whitehead, and
Pierce, were too much for the
Cards.
In the fourth quarter Ed Tucker
stole the ball from Bob Likens,
Jribbled the length of the floor for
the lay-up, and was fouled on the
shot by Kurland. He made the free
throw and Stanford trailed by one
point, 60-59.
The Oilers fought off Stanford's
comeback attempt and led 75-70
with a minute and a half remaining.
Ron Torn ic broke through the Oil
ers' freeze for one tally, and Jim
Ramstead hit another to make the
score 75-74. Stanford couldn't come
any closer, and went down fighting,
78-74.
From the spectator's point of
view, the game left litlle to be de
sired. Stanford hit on 41 per cent
of their shots, and the Oilers made
35 per cent. Stanford came closer
to the Oilers than all except two
teams this year. The victory
brought the Oilers' record to 33
and 1.

Stanford was the best basketball team in the country for 25

In a game that was easily the year's best in the Pavilion, the
Cards succumbed to the mighty Phillips Oilers, 78-74, after leading

The game was tight right down to the wire as the men from

Bartlesville held a 75-74 lead with
21 seconds to go. Jim Walsh was

Claude Ilouchin made the first of
two free throws.
The Oilers waived the second,

In a game that was easily the year's best in the Pavilion, the
Cards succumbed to the mighty Phillips Oilers, 78-74, after leading

The game was tight right down to the wire as the men from

The scoring was even after that as
both teams hit with amazing regu

quarter. At this point ,the second

flawless exhibitions of basketball

Kurland knotted the count at 29-

next four minutes they scored 10

the half-time score to 39-33.
The capacity crowd at the Pavil

The Cards had brought the

second half, however, as a steady
stream of Phillips reserves began to

the count up to 49-43. They then

They knotted the count at 50-all,

combined with the height of Kur
land, G-ft. 9-in. Bus Whitehead, and

Cards.
In the fourth quarter Ed Tucker
stole the ball from Bob Likens,
Jribbled the length of the floor for
the lay-up, and was fouled on the
shot by Kurland. He made the free
throw and Stanford trailed by one
point, 60-59.
The Oilers fought off Stanford's
comeback attempt and led 75-70
with a minute and a half remaining.
Ron Torn ic broke through the Oil

Ramstead hit another to make the
score 75-74. Stanford couldn't come
any closer, and went down fighting,
78-74.
From the spectator's point of
view, the game left litlle to be de

of their shots, and the Oilers made
35 per cent. Stanford came closer
