# For the 'Publishers'—A Note on Policy
## 
### 
Today marks the half-way point in the pub
lication of The Daily this year. And with all
the shouting over the administration-imposed
adviser on the Daily Californian, (the shouting
mostly in journalistic circles, just murmurs per
haps, elsewhere) right now is an appropriate
time for a fev/ remarks about Daily policy.
The Daily is published by the Associated
Students. Realizing this, we try to make each
day's paper something that is acceptable to the
"publishers"—which isn't always an easy job.
First, our space is limited. We are forced
to make editorial decisions that c<£uld seem
prejudiced against campus groups. But in mak
ing the decisions, our primary consideration
has been and will continue to be what has le
gitimate news value for the student body.
We consciously play no favorites among
groups seeking publicity. But we will make
mistakes. We knew that, and we know when
we do, we'll have people on our necks. But
we'll be less apt to make the same mistakes
again.
Our editorial policy is not an attempt to re
flect student opinion. We consider this im
possible. Nor is it an attempt to reflect the ad
ministration's viewpoint. This we consider un
desirable.
Editorials in these columns reflect the opinion
of the writer anci The Daily's six-member edi
torial board, composed of the editor, managing
editor, two associate editors, staff editor, and
sports editor. Unsigned editorials are by the
editor. Those by other members of the edi
torial board will be followed by the writer's
name.

And a few words about the column at the
bottom of the page, "Campus Opinion," The
column can be interesting, enlightening, and
useful. It can reflect what it is designed to re
flect—opinion—of any shade.
Sometimes it doesn't. It can degenerate into
a forum for personal feuds, often in a light vein,
but nonetheless personal. We realize there can
be an entertainment element in letters. And
we'll continue to publish, to a point, those we
consider inconsequential and purely personal.
At the same time we encourage the oilier type.
There aren't often a lot ot burning, door
die issues on this campus. But there are some
on which students have a legitimate right to
express opinion. The problem of the Young
Republicans; Excom's recommendation that
the legal minimum drinking age be towered
to 18; the lower division language require
ment are a tew that are controversial to vary
ing extents.
We believe there is a considerable split
among students 021 these questions, and that
airing opinions is not only healthy, but prac
tical.
Excom is Stanford's voice. That 16 member
body decides to circulate recommendations
about lowering the legal drinking age, recom
mends approval of the Young Republicans to
the Board of Trustees, and in acting likes to
know just what is "campus opinion" insofar as
something so nebulous and diverse can be de
fined.
It cannot be pin-pointed, either by pressure
Irom Excom members' constituents or by let
ters to The Daily. But these can at lear.t give
a welcomed indication.

gitimate news value for the student body.
We consciously play no favorites among
groups seeking publicity. But we will make
mistakes. We knew that, and we know when
we do, we'll have people on our necks. But
we'll be less apt to make the same mistakes
again.
Our editorial policy is not an attempt to re
flect student opinion. We consider this im
possible. Nor is it an attempt to reflect the ad
ministration's viewpoint. This we consider un
desirable.
Editorials in these columns reflect the opinion
of the writer anci The Daily's six-member edi
torial board, composed of the editor, managing
editor, two associate editors, staff editor, and
sports editor. Unsigned editorials are by the
editor. Those by other members of the edi
torial board will be followed by the writer's
name.

And a few words about the column at the
bottom of the page, "Campus Opinion," The
column can be interesting, enlightening, and
useful. It can reflect what it is designed to re
flect—opinion—of any shade.
Sometimes it doesn't. It can degenerate into
a forum for personal feuds, often in a light vein,
but nonetheless personal. We realize there can
be an entertainment element in letters. And
we'll continue to publish, to a point, those we
consider inconsequential and purely personal.
At the same time we encourage the oilier type.
There aren't often a lot ot burning, door
die issues on this campus. But there are some
on which students have a legitimate right to
express opinion. The problem of the Young
Republicans; Excom's recommendation that
the legal minimum drinking age be towered
to 18; the lower division language require
ment are a tew that are controversial to vary
ing extents.
We believe there is a considerable split
among students 021 these questions, and that
airing opinions is not only healthy, but prac
tical.
Excom is Stanford's voice. That 16 member
body decides to circulate recommendations
about lowering the legal drinking age, recom
mends approval of the Young Republicans to
the Board of Trustees, and in acting likes to
know just what is "campus opinion" insofar as
something so nebulous and diverse can be de
fined.
It cannot be pin-pointed, either by pressure
Irom Excom members' constituents or by let
ters to The Daily. But these can at lear.t give
a welcomed indication.
Today marks the half-way point in the pub

the shouting over the administration-imposed
adviser on the Daily Californian, (the shouting
mostly in journalistic circles, just murmurs per

time for a fev/ remarks about Daily policy.

First, our space is limited. We are forced
