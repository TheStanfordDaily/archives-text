# BULL SESSION
## 
### PETE GROTHE 
Mr. Editor, please, no more assignments like that!
Jack McDonald, who begins his regime today as
chief rooster of Volume 121, came up to me recently
and said, "Say, I've got a great idea. Over in Branner
and Roble lies a great wealth of untapped Bull Session
material. Go over and ask some of those freshman
girls what their most embarrassing experiences have
been."

"But, Jack," I reasoned, "You
realize what this means.. This
means going into the never-never
land of a girl's diary. This means
prying out items that a girl
wouldn't tell her best friend."
"Go," said the editor, pointing
a finger at Branner's ivied walls.
Being an agreeable person, I
got out my special typewriter
(as many of you know, my type
writer is special because some

pens write under water, but my typewriter writes
Underwood), and whipped over to Branner.
And thus began the most trying experience in my
young journalistic career. It wasn't that the pink
cheeked Branner-ites were unwilling to submit to
an interview. K was .hist a case of their being too
embarrassed to say anything. They blushed. In
technicolor.
The first girl I interviewed smilpd coyly as she
said, "Gosh and gee, I'm always embarrassed. In
fact, I'm so embarrassed now that I can't say
anything."
I button-holed a second gill and put forth the
question. "Whal was your most embarrassing ex
perience?" She looked at me wildly, yelped a
maniacal scream, and headed for the door faster
than a football coach would head for Harlan Stroud.
1 went hack to the editor and explained to him my
tioubles. But he had just finished reading Dick Mc-
Lean's expose of The Daily staff and was in a grumpy
mood. "Go!" ho ordered, pointing a finger at Koble's
ivied walls.
I went.
In justice to the Poble girls, I must say that there
were more cooperative about the whole thing. And
so, following are the cream of the crop of most em
barrassing experiences:
YOUNG DRUNKARD. Annabelle Ilorchitz, San
Marino, accompanied her boy friend to a picnic in
the middle of a grassy lot. The bill of fare was
potatoes (which were to be baked) and Pertusson's
Cough Medicine, which they both dearly loved.
Annabelle and her boy friend were both six years

old, unschooled in the ways of the world, and un
aware of the alcohol content of Pertusson's Cough
Medicine. The two polished off several bottles, and
several hours later firemen carried two thoroughly
snockered six-year-olds home. Annabelle didn't
sober up for three days.
I DON'T FEEL WELL. Beverly Kennedy, South
Pasadena, had an 8:30 date and a 9:150 date. The
9:30 date arrived at Roble early, was informed by
Bev's roommate that Bev was sick in bed. Where
upon the 9:30 date bumped into Beverly and the 8:30
date. All of which prompted Bev to beeome what
she was asserted to be—sick.
"I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET—" Joan Welch, Santa
Barbara, was at a cocktail party. Trying to l>e
sociable, she introduced two people, saying, "Say,
Mr. Perry, I'd like you to meet—er, what is your
name again?"
"Mrs. Perry."
HI! ,Cynthia Fay, Beverly Hills, rushed up behind
a friend at the Encina Formal, threw her arms around
him, hugged him, discovered she didn't know him.
YOUR AUTOGRAPH, PLEASE. Judy Garland, San
Francisco, traveled on a liner to Europe recently. All
the passengers, seeing the name "Judy Garland" on
the ship list, persuaded the Captain to hold a tea in
his cabin so one and all could meet the famous movie
star. It was one of the most unsuccessful teas ever
given.
GRAFT. Patt Sehonberg, Hinsdale, 111., was min
ing back on a passenger ship from Bermuda. Came
time for the elimination dance of the liner's big
ball and Patt was chosen as Ihe one who draws the
numbers out of the hat. Out ol' the 500 participants,
her parents won.
INTRODUCTION. Joan Benny, Beverly Hills,
daughter of the radio comedian, was driving to a
tennis lesson with several kids whom she didn't know.
The picture "The Horn Blows At Midnight," in which
her father starred, had just come out. And the kids
took turns at criticizing both the flick and the star.
The tennis instructor said, "Oh, yes, I don't think
you've all met —this is Joan Benny."
SNAP! Marcia Robertson, Spokane, was doing a
spot of water skiing at Loon Lake. Her father wanted
to take a picture of her, .so he ordered her to smile
prettily as she did the take-off from the dock. She
struck her best tooth-paste ad smile as she took off
on the skis, but for some reason or other, everyone
was guffawing heartily. They were still muffling their
snickers as she returned to her dock. Then someone
informed Marcia that just as her dad was taking the
picture, a nail on the dock took away a strategic part
of her bathing suit.

prying out items that a girl
wouldn't tell her best friend."
"Go," said the editor, pointing
a finger at Branner's ivied walls.
Being an agreeable person, I
got out my special typewriter
(as many of you know, my type
writer is special because some

pens write under water, but my typewriter writes
Underwood), and whipped over to Branner.
And thus began the most trying experience in my
young journalistic career. It wasn't that the pink
cheeked Branner-ites were unwilling to submit to
an interview. K was .hist a case of their being too
embarrassed to say anything. They blushed. In
technicolor.
The first girl I interviewed smilpd coyly as she
said, "Gosh and gee, I'm always embarrassed. In
fact, I'm so embarrassed now that I can't say
anything."
I button-holed a second gill and put forth the
question. "Whal was your most embarrassing ex
perience?" She looked at me wildly, yelped a
maniacal scream, and headed for the door faster
than a football coach would head for Harlan Stroud.
1 went hack to the editor and explained to him my
tioubles. But he had just finished reading Dick Mc-
Lean's expose of The Daily staff and was in a grumpy
mood. "Go!" ho ordered, pointing a finger at Koble's
ivied walls.
I went.
In justice to the Poble girls, I must say that there
were more cooperative about the whole thing. And
so, following are the cream of the crop of most em
barrassing experiences:
YOUNG DRUNKARD. Annabelle Ilorchitz, San
Marino, accompanied her boy friend to a picnic in
the middle of a grassy lot. The bill of fare was
potatoes (which were to be baked) and Pertusson's
Cough Medicine, which they both dearly loved.
Annabelle and her boy friend were both six years

old, unschooled in the ways of the world, and un
aware of the alcohol content of Pertusson's Cough
Medicine. The two polished off several bottles, and
several hours later firemen carried two thoroughly
snockered six-year-olds home. Annabelle didn't
sober up for three days.
I DON'T FEEL WELL. Beverly Kennedy, South
Pasadena, had an 8:30 date and a 9:150 date. The
9:30 date arrived at Roble early, was informed by
Bev's roommate that Bev was sick in bed. Where
upon the 9:30 date bumped into Beverly and the 8:30
date. All of which prompted Bev to beeome what
she was asserted to be—sick.
"I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET—" Joan Welch, Santa
Barbara, was at a cocktail party. Trying to l>e
sociable, she introduced two people, saying, "Say,
Mr. Perry, I'd like you to meet—er, what is your
name again?"
"Mrs. Perry."
HI! ,Cynthia Fay, Beverly Hills, rushed up behind
a friend at the Encina Formal, threw her arms around
him, hugged him, discovered she didn't know him.
YOUR AUTOGRAPH, PLEASE. Judy Garland, San
Francisco, traveled on a liner to Europe recently. All
the passengers, seeing the name "Judy Garland" on
the ship list, persuaded the Captain to hold a tea in
his cabin so one and all could meet the famous movie
star. It was one of the most unsuccessful teas ever
given.
GRAFT. Patt Sehonberg, Hinsdale, 111., was min
ing back on a passenger ship from Bermuda. Came
time for the elimination dance of the liner's big
ball and Patt was chosen as Ihe one who draws the
numbers out of the hat. Out ol' the 500 participants,
her parents won.
INTRODUCTION. Joan Benny, Beverly Hills,
daughter of the radio comedian, was driving to a
tennis lesson with several kids whom she didn't know.
The picture "The Horn Blows At Midnight," in which
her father starred, had just come out. And the kids
took turns at criticizing both the flick and the star.
The tennis instructor said, "Oh, yes, I don't think
you've all met —this is Joan Benny."
SNAP! Marcia Robertson, Spokane, was doing a
spot of water skiing at Loon Lake. Her father wanted
to take a picture of her, .so he ordered her to smile
prettily as she did the take-off from the dock. She
struck her best tooth-paste ad smile as she took off
on the skis, but for some reason or other, everyone
was guffawing heartily. They were still muffling their
snickers as she returned to her dock. Then someone
informed Marcia that just as her dad was taking the
picture, a nail on the dock took away a strategic part
of her bathing suit.

Mr. Editor, please, no more assignments like that!
Jack McDonald, who begins his regime today as
chief rooster of Volume 121, came up to me recently
and said, "Say, I've got a great idea. Over in Branner
and Roble lies a great wealth of untapped Bull Session
material. Go over and ask some of those freshman
girls what their most embarrassing experiences have
been."

"But, Jack," I reasoned, "You
realize what this means.. This

an interview. K was .hist a case of their being too
embarrassed to say anything. They blushed. In
technicolor.
The first girl I interviewed smilpd coyly as she
said, "Gosh and gee, I'm always embarrassed. In
fact, I'm so embarrassed now that I can't say
anything."
I button-holed a second gill and put forth the
question. "Whal was your most embarrassing ex
perience?" She looked at me wildly, yelped a
maniacal scream, and headed for the door faster
than a football coach would head for Harlan Stroud.
1 went hack to the editor and explained to him my
tioubles. But he had just finished reading Dick Mc-
Lean's expose of The Daily staff and was in a grumpy
mood. "Go!" ho ordered, pointing a finger at Koble's
ivied walls.
I went.
In justice to the Poble girls, I must say that there
were more cooperative about the whole thing. And
so, following are the cream of the crop of most em
barrassing experiences:
YOUNG DRUNKARD. Annabelle Ilorchitz, San
Marino, accompanied her boy friend to a picnic in
the middle of a grassy lot. The bill of fare was
potatoes (which were to be baked) and Pertusson's
Cough Medicine, which they both dearly loved.
Annabelle and her boy friend were both six years

old, unschooled in the ways of the world, and un
aware of the alcohol content of Pertusson's Cough
Medicine. The two polished off several bottles, and
several hours later firemen carried two thoroughly
snockered six-year-olds home. Annabelle didn't
sober up for three days.
I DON'T FEEL WELL. Beverly Kennedy, South
Pasadena, had an 8:30 date and a 9:150 date. The
9:30 date arrived at Roble early, was informed by
Bev's roommate that Bev was sick in bed. Where
upon the 9:30 date bumped into Beverly and the 8:30
date. All of which prompted Bev to beeome what
she was asserted to be—sick.
"I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET—" Joan Welch, Santa
Barbara, was at a cocktail party. Trying to l>e
sociable, she introduced two people, saying, "Say,
Mr. Perry, I'd like you to meet—er, what is your
name again?"
"Mrs. Perry."
HI! ,Cynthia Fay, Beverly Hills, rushed up behind
a friend at the Encina Formal, threw her arms around
him, hugged him, discovered she didn't know him.
YOUR AUTOGRAPH, PLEASE. Judy Garland, San
Francisco, traveled on a liner to Europe recently. All
the passengers, seeing the name "Judy Garland" on
the ship list, persuaded the Captain to hold a tea in
his cabin so one and all could meet the famous movie
star. It was one of the most unsuccessful teas ever
given.
GRAFT. Patt Sehonberg, Hinsdale, 111., was min
ing back on a passenger ship from Bermuda. Came
time for the elimination dance of the liner's big
ball and Patt was chosen as Ihe one who draws the
numbers out of the hat. Out ol' the 500 participants,
her parents won.
INTRODUCTION. Joan Benny, Beverly Hills,
daughter of the radio comedian, was driving to a
tennis lesson with several kids whom she didn't know.
The picture "The Horn Blows At Midnight," in which
her father starred, had just come out. And the kids
took turns at criticizing both the flick and the star.
The tennis instructor said, "Oh, yes, I don't think
you've all met —this is Joan Benny."
SNAP! Marcia Robertson, Spokane, was doing a
spot of water skiing at Loon Lake. Her father wanted
to take a picture of her, .so he ordered her to smile
prettily as she did the take-off from the dock. She
struck her best tooth-paste ad smile as she took off
on the skis, but for some reason or other, everyone
was guffawing heartily. They were still muffling their
snickers as she returned to her dock. Then someone
informed Marcia that just as her dad was taking the
picture, a nail on the dock took away a strategic part
of her bathing suit.

Mr. Editor, please, no more assignments like that!
Jack McDonald, who begins his regime today as
chief rooster of Volume 121, came up to me recently
and said, "Say, I've got a great idea. Over in Branner
and Roble lies a great wealth of untapped Bull Session
material. Go over and ask some of those freshman
girls what their most embarrassing experiences have
been."

"But, Jack," I reasoned, "You
realize what this means.. This
means going into the never-never
land of a girl's diary. This means
prying out items that a girl
wouldn't tell her best friend."
"Go," said the editor, pointing
a finger at Branner's ivied walls.
Being an agreeable person, I
got out my special typewriter
(as many of you know, my type
writer is special because some

pens write under water, but my typewriter writes
Underwood), and whipped over to Branner.
And thus began the most trying experience in my
young journalistic career. It wasn't that the pink
cheeked Branner-ites were unwilling to submit to
an interview. K was .hist a case of their being too
embarrassed to say anything. They blushed. In
technicolor.
