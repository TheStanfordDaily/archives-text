# Stanford Footballers Help a Polio Victim
## 
### 
To the Editor:
A few days ago, I had the very pleasant experience
of opening a letter from Bill McColl. The letter con
tained two one dollar bills with the signatures of the
entire Stanford Rose Bowl Squad. I thought that
you'd be interested in knowing the story behind this
letter and why the boys on the squad, especially Bill,
v/ent to all this trouble.
At the playing of the Rose Bowl game in Pasa
dena—a little girl by the name of Betty Young, from
Des Moines, lowa, was then living in an iron lung
as the result of a battle with polio. This little girl
sent this office a request, which although quite diffi
cult at the time, I just did not have the courage to
turn down. The request was for the autographs of
the Stanford University players!
I forwarded the request of this little girl on to the
boys with the (bought that it would mean so much to
this youngster who was fighting a pretty lonely battle
all by herself.
Needles:; to say, I was quite thrilled to get the
letter bark with all of the signatures, to say nothing
of the wonderful comments that accompanied same.
1 can only imagine the thrill that Betty will have when
.••he sep<; this! Having been with this organization for
a number of years, I know how much this will mean

to her, and I like to think that it will hp an inspira
tion and assistance in winning this battle with this
dreaded erippler.
Although I did not attend Stanford, I have always
admired the school am) the caliber of young men
and women who graduate each year—they are a
credit to any university. I would like to say that
although they lost the ball game on this past New
Year's day, they were still a great credit to their
university—even in their defeat. Every one likes
to win, but now and again, it just isn't to be. But,
when everything is going against a club, then I
think that it takes just a little bit more to stay in
the ball game and keep on trying. Having been
close to the athletic picture all of my life, I know
that your team was putting everything (hey bad into
it—and in our American way of life, that's what
matters —not who won or who lost.
Again, iny most sincere thanks and appreciation to
a great squad, a fine coach and an outstanding uni
versity.

Although I did not attend Stanford, I have always
admired the school am) the caliber of young men
and women who graduate each year—they are a
credit to any university. I would like to say that
although they lost the ball game on this past New
Year's day, they were still a great credit to their
university—even in their defeat. Every one likes
to win, but now and again, it just isn't to be. But,
when everything is going against a club, then I
think that it takes just a little bit more to stay in
the ball game and keep on trying. Having been
close to the athletic picture all of my life, I know
that your team was putting everything (hey bad into
it—and in our American way of life, that's what
matters —not who won or who lost.
Again, iny most sincere thanks and appreciation to
a great squad, a fine coach and an outstanding uni
versity.

A few days ago, I had the very pleasant experience
of opening a letter from Bill McColl. The letter con
tained two one dollar bills with the signatures of the
entire Stanford Rose Bowl Squad. I thought that
you'd be interested in knowing the story behind this
letter and why the boys on the squad, especially Bill,
v/ent to all this trouble.
At the playing of the Rose Bowl game in Pasa
dena—a little girl by the name of Betty Young, from
Des Moines, lowa, was then living in an iron lung
as the result of a battle with polio. This little girl
sent this office a request, which although quite diffi
cult at the time, I just did not have the courage to
turn down. The request was for the autographs of
the Stanford University players!
I forwarded the request of this little girl on to the
boys with the (bought that it would mean so much to
this youngster who was fighting a pretty lonely battle
all by herself.
Needles:; to say, I was quite thrilled to get the
letter bark with all of the signatures, to say nothing
of the wonderful comments that accompanied same.
