# Farm Student Describes Russification of Germany
## 
### DAVID WONG 
How Russia is converting the
state of the Soviet pattern is the
subject of a study now being
made by a Stanford student,
with the help of information sent
by the East German under
ground and material collected
by the Hoover Library.
Miss Irene Blumenthal, a Ph.D.
candidate in political science at
Stanford, is making the study. Miss
Blumenthal already holds an LL.B.
and a Ph.D. from the University of
Vienna. She was born in Russia
and was studying in France when
World War II broke out. She then
went to Vienna where she com
pleted her studies.
Her thesis is that the Soviets
are changing the social, economic,
and political structure of East
Germany through changes in law.
For example, although the con
ventional bill of rights is included
piis toc'ny, tomorrow, and Wednes
operative by tiie qualifying clause
that such liberties are denied to
"the enemies of democracy."
Through the SED (Socialist Unity
Party) Russia is actually in abso
lute control of East Germany.
Many of the members in the East
German government are Soviet citi
zens, Miss Blumenthal said. They
are former Communist refugees
who fled to Russia when Germany
was under the Nazi regime. The
government is not popular with the
people because they recognize it as
a Russian deal.
However, psychologically, the
Russians have been much smarter

than the Allies in certain aspects.
For example, quite .soon after the
war they put themselves up as fa
voring German reunification and
permitted a certain amount of Ger
man reorganization. They have used
tiie whole issue very cleverly.
On the other hand, Miss Blu
menthal saitl the Russians also
committed some serious blunders.
Cue yap which separates Russia
from Germany is the fact that
Kussiu has kept her German pris
oners of war. Another is the
atrocities which the Russian
troops co m milted when they
marched into Germany.
Comparing the Soviet and the
Nazi regimes, Miss Blumenthal said
the basic patterns are very similar.
Both of them are antidemocratic,
authoritarian, and centralized. Both
make use of police, terror, and mass
organizations.
In the field of economics, most of
the important industrial works are
Soviet-owned and are worked for
the direct benefit of the Soviet Un
ion. The other industries are large
ly state-owned.
The general living standard is
lower than in Westevn Germany.
However, there is no unemploy
ment in East Germany. That is
partly due to the fact that the
Russians are taking reparations
out of current production in vio
lation of the Potsdam agreement.
While she cannot foresee the
eventual solution to the German
problem, Miss Blumenthal pointed
out that it cannot be solved on the
German level. Because of the pres
sures being exerted from both East
and West, the German problem is,
in fact, a world problem.

with the help of information sent
by the East German under
ground and material collected
by the Hoover Library.
Miss Irene Blumenthal, a Ph.D.
candidate in political science at
Stanford, is making the study. Miss
Blumenthal already holds an LL.B.
and a Ph.D. from the University of
Vienna. She was born in Russia
and was studying in France when
World War II broke out. She then
went to Vienna where she com
pleted her studies.
Her thesis is that the Soviets
are changing the social, economic,
and political structure of East
Germany through changes in law.
For example, although the con
ventional bill of rights is included
piis toc'ny, tomorrow, and Wednes
operative by tiie qualifying clause
that such liberties are denied to
"the enemies of democracy."
Through the SED (Socialist Unity
Party) Russia is actually in abso
lute control of East Germany.
Many of the members in the East
German government are Soviet citi
zens, Miss Blumenthal said. They
are former Communist refugees
who fled to Russia when Germany
was under the Nazi regime. The
government is not popular with the
people because they recognize it as
a Russian deal.
However, psychologically, the
Russians have been much smarter

than the Allies in certain aspects.
For example, quite .soon after the
war they put themselves up as fa
voring German reunification and
permitted a certain amount of Ger
man reorganization. They have used
tiie whole issue very cleverly.
On the other hand, Miss Blu
menthal saitl the Russians also
committed some serious blunders.
Cue yap which separates Russia
from Germany is the fact that
Kussiu has kept her German pris
oners of war. Another is the
atrocities which the Russian
troops co m milted when they
marched into Germany.
Comparing the Soviet and the
Nazi regimes, Miss Blumenthal said
the basic patterns are very similar.
Both of them are antidemocratic,
authoritarian, and centralized. Both
make use of police, terror, and mass
organizations.
In the field of economics, most of
the important industrial works are
Soviet-owned and are worked for
the direct benefit of the Soviet Un
ion. The other industries are large
ly state-owned.
The general living standard is
lower than in Westevn Germany.
However, there is no unemploy
ment in East Germany. That is
partly due to the fact that the
Russians are taking reparations
out of current production in vio
lation of the Potsdam agreement.
While she cannot foresee the
eventual solution to the German
problem, Miss Blumenthal pointed
out that it cannot be solved on the
German level. Because of the pres
sures being exerted from both East
and West, the German problem is,
in fact, a world problem.
How Russia is converting the
state of the Soviet pattern is the
subject of a study now being
made by a Stanford student,
with the help of information sent
by the East German under
ground and material collected
by the Hoover Library.
