### DAVE FREEMAN 
Led by center Bill Dickenson, El
Toro trounced El Cuadro, 51-19, in
mural basketball action at the Pa
vilion Saturday. The game was
completely dominated by the El
Toros, who led all the way after
opening the contest with eight
straight points. The half-time score

The El Toro attack featured a
fine floor game and complete con

with their taller opponents in the
rebound department. Bill Dicken
son's 16 points was high for the
winners, followed by Larry "King"

with four points for the losers.
At the Encina Gym, in another
Saturday mural contest, Phi Psi II
downed Theta Delt 11, 25-20. The
superior speed of the smaller Phi
Psi squad and the shooting accu
racy of Bob Wycoff, with 15 points,
were the deciding factors of the
contest. The game was close all the
way, with the score at the half 12-8
in favor of the winners. High point
man for the losers was Bill Rhor
with eight.
